These facilities \nwere part of ADB\u2019s Small and Medium Enterprise Development Support Project.  \n \nreviews  the  nonsovereign \n \ncomponents  of  the  above  project  involving  the  provision  of  a  PCG  to  one  financial \ninstitution to support its lending to  small and  medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and  a \nproposed equity investment in a CIB. The rationale and objectives of both components \nwere to improve the enabling environment for SMEs and their ability to access finance.  \n \n \nThe  PCG  facility  was  a  revolving  local  currency,  credit-enhancement  facility \ndesigned  to  support  participating  financial  institutions  (PFIs)  lending  to  SMEs.  The \nfacility  was  set  up  to  guarantee  agreed  credit  risk  amounts  associated  with  PFIs\u2019 \nportfolios  of  loans  and  other  credit  exposure  to  their  SME  borrowers.  In  September \n2006, ADB approved Security Bank Corporation (SBC) as the first and only PFI under the \nPCG facility, with ADB and SBC operating on a 50\u201350 loss-sharing basis. The SBC facility \nwas  for  P500  million  (50%  of  the  total  PCG  amount),  of  which  P100  million  was \nallocated  to  Universal  Robina  Corporation  (URC).  All  transactions  for  URC  distributors \nwere structured as domestic standby letters of credit. The first transaction to URC was \nmade  in  January  2008.  The  maximum  utilization  of  P98.8  million  was  achieved  in \nFebruary  2010,  and  the  last  transaction  matured  in  February  2011.  No  default  or \ninvocation of ADB\u2019s guarantee has been recorded.   \n \n \nIn  February  2011,  ADB  cancelled  the  unallocated  balance  of  the  P500  million \nPCG facility and the proposed $1 million equity investment in the  CIB. The PCG facility \nwas terminated in April 2012 at the end of the availability period due to the low level \nof utilization. The equity transaction was cancelled because the established corporation \ndeviated from the ownership structure and oversight arrangements originally approved \nby ADB\u2019s Board. At the time of ADB Board approval, it  had been envisaged the equity \ninvestment  would  be  made  to  a  nonsovereign  entity,  but  the  credit  bureau  was \nestablished by the government as a majority state-owned enterprise, and was ineligible \nfor ADB\u2019s nonsovereign funding. \n \n \nThe project is rated unsuccessful overall, based on unsatisfactory ratings for its \ndevelopment impact and  outcome and ADB  work  quality, and a less than satisfactory \nrating for ADB investment profitability and ADB additionality. \n \n \nThe  development  impact  and  outcome  of  the  project  is  rated  unsatisfactory \nbased  on  component  ratings  for  private  sector  development;  business  success; \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nxii  Small and Medium Enterprise Development Support Project \n\ninvoluntary \n\nresettlement,  and \n\n \n \ncontribution  to  economic  development;  and  environmental,  social  health,  and  safety \nperformance.  The  facility\u2019s  overall  effect  on  private  sector  development  is  rated \nunsatisfactory since the expectation that it would be utilized by a number of PFIs, cover \na  range  of  SMEs  across  sectors,  and  support  different  financial  instruments  was  not \nrealized. Only half of the facility (P500 million) was allocated to only one intermediary \n(SBC),  which  financed  smaller  distributors  of  one  food  manufacturer  for  up  to  P100 \nmillion.  The  investment  in  the  CIB  never  took  place.  The  project\u2019s  business  success  is \nrated less than satisfactory since less than 10% of the allotted funds were utilized. The \nPCG facility impacted a select few SMEs, which is a positive accomplishment. However, \ngiven the small size of the facility relative to SBC and its limited  utilization by SBC, its \nimpact on SMEs by improving access to finance was minimal. Economic sustainability is \nrated  unsatisfactory  for  the  same  reasons.  Although  it  is  possible,  the  intervention \ncould have generated some new jobs, its limited scale made a minimal contribution to \nthe  local  economy.  On  environmental,  social,  health,  and  safety  performance,  ADB\u2019s \ninvestment is rated satisfactory given SBC\u2019s compliance with environmental standards, \nindigenous  peoples\u2019 \npractices  and  procedures, \nsafeguards.  \n \n \nAlthough  there  were  no  defaults  or  invocation  of  ADB\u2019s  guarantee,  the \ninvestment  profitability  based  on  average  utilization  and  relative  to  capital  allocation \nrequirements is rated less than satisfactory.  \n \n \nADB's  work  quality  is  rated  unsatisfactory  based  on  component  ratings  for \nscreening,  appraisal,  and  structuring  of  the  project,  monitoring  and  supervision,  and \nADB\u2019s role and contribution. ADB's performance in screening, appraisal, and structuring \nis  rated  unsatisfactory  because  of  the  low  utilization  (only  one  intermediary \nparticipated  in  the  project)  and  the  fact  that  ADB  did  not  implement  the  first  loss \nprovision in the  guarantee agreement. The shortfalls in monitoring and supervision of \nthe facility are illustrated by the lack of new PFIs being selected and its low utilization. \nThere  was  considerable  delay  in  following  up  the  request  of  SBC  to  increase  its \nallocation to URC, which contributed to underutilization. The constant changing of ADB \nstaff  contacts  meant  there  was  no  real  continuity  of  supervision.  Since  overall \nmonitoring  and  supervision  was  not  proactive  in  detecting  problems  or  issues,  it  is \nrated unsatisfactory. ADB\u2019s role and contribution is rated less than satisfactory. Efforts \nto raise awareness and use of the facility by other Philippine banks and other clients of \nSBC  were  below  expectations.  No  additional  intermediaries  were  identified  prior  to \napproval, leading to considerable underutilization of the project.   \n \nADB\u2019s additionality  is rated less than satisfactory. This rating would have been \n \nhigher if the facility had been adopted by at least a few PFIs or benefited a wider set of \nSME clients of SBC.  \n \n \n\nThe assessment offers these lessons: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nMore  work  should  have  been  undertaken  to  establish  an  adequate \npipeline of PFIs at the outset. \nPricing needs to be market related and fully reflect project risks. Where \nmarket comparators do not exist, more exhaustive studies and analyses \nof the effective demand for guarantees should have taken place. \n\n\f \n\nExecutive Summary \n\n \n\n xiii \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nThe  impact  of  ADB  staff  changes  on  the  monitoring  process  was \nunderestimated.  Although  the  need  for  effective  monitoring  was \nstressed  in  the  report  and  recommendation  of  the  President  (RRP),  its \noutcome was far from satisfactory.  \nBetter  due  diligence  of  the  financial  intermediary  for  the  PCG  should \nhave  taken  place  as  ADB  neither  fully  considered  SBC\u2019s  risk  rating \nprocess nor understood its processes and procedures. \nBetter  due  diligence  should  have  been  undertaken  for  the  proposed \nequity  investment  in  the  CIB,  and  the  risks  of  the  government \nestablishing  a  state-owned  corporation,  rather  than  a  private \ncorporation  adequately  flagged  in  the  RRP,  to  avoid  unnecessarily \nlocking up ADB headroom.  \n\nADB  should  improve  its  due  diligence  and  screening,  and  identify, \nselect, and sign up a number of PFIs before approval. \nADB  transactions  should  be  made  more  replicable,  and  ADB  should \ngrant more autonomy in decision making to the PFIs,  establish there is \nsufficient  demand  for  the  proposed  project,  adopt  more  rigorous \nmarket-based pricing, and encourage its wider use to cover guarantees \nfor  term  lending  by  SMEs  as  well  as  for  covering  domestic  standby \nletters of credit. \nADB needs to improve its monitoring of project implementation and be \nmore  flexible  in  responding  to  changes  needed  during  project \nimplementation.  \n\nRecommended actions for future projects:  \n\n     \n\n \n\n\f\fIn August 2005, \nADB Board of \nDirectors \napproved a \npartial credit \nguarantee (PCG) \nfacility of P1 \nbillion \n\nCHAPTER 1 \n\nThe Project \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \nA. \n\nProject Background \n\n1. \nIn  August  2005,  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  Board  of  Directors \napproved  a  partial  credit  guarantee  (PCG)  facility  of  P1  billion,  a  JPY2.75  billion  ($25 \nmillion  equivalent)  loan  guaranteed  by  the  Republic  of  the  Philippines  to  the  Small \nBusiness  Guarantee  and  Finance  Corporation,  and  an  equity  investment  of  up  to  $1 \nmillion  in  a  proposed  credit  information  bureau  (CIB).  These  facilities  were  part  of \n\nADB\u2019s Small and Medium Enterprise Development Support Project, which responded to \na  request  from  the  Government  of  the  Philippines  for  assistance  in  implementing  its \nsmall and medium-sized enterprise (SME) development plan, 2004\u20132010.1 \n \n2. \nPrior  to  this  approval,  ADB  had  financed  a  project  preparatory  technical \nassistance  in  2003  to  assess  the  status  of  SMEs  in  the  Philippines,  which  included  an \nanalysis  of  the  government\u2019s  development  policies  and  actions,  and  the  issues  and \nconstraints  facing  the  SME  sector.  The  study  found  that  despite  SMEs\u2019  vital \ncontributions to the economy, their effective operations and growth were constrained \nby poor access to finance.2  \n \n3. \nThis project performance evaluation report is concerned with the private sector \ncomponent  of  the  Small  and  Medium  Enterprise  Development  Support  Project,  which \ninvolved providing PCGs for one financial institution to support its lending to SMEs and \nthe  proposed  equity  investment  in  a  CIB,  which  was  cancelled  in  February  2011. \nAppendix  1  contains \nits \nimplementation. \n \nB. \n\nthe  project  highlights  and  additional  details  on \n\nKey Project Features \n\nThe  PCG \n\nfacility  was  a \n\n4. \nlocal  currency,  credit-enhancement \nrevolving \narrangement  designed  to  support  participating  financial  institutions  (PFIs)  in  the \nPhilippines. The facility was set up to guarantee agreed credit risk amounts associated \nwith  PFIs\u2019  portfolios  of  loans  and  other  credit  exposure  to  their  SME  borrowers,  who \nwere selected according to specified criteria.  \n \n5. \nThe  PCG  facility  was  an  innovative  instrument  that  was  designed  to  enhance \nthe capacity of ADB\u2019s private sector loan and credit facilities and  to provide innovative \n                                                      \n1  Department of Trade and Industry.

The PCG facility \nwas  based  on  the  concept  of  ADB  risk  participation  with  PFIs  to  stimulate  lending  to \nSMEs. ADB and PFI recourse was limited to the underlying guaranteed portfolio of SME \nloans,  and  not  to  the  PFIs\u2019  balance  sheets.  Under  the  facility,  ADB  set  a  limit  of  P1 \nbillion  to  be  allocated  among  selected  PFIs,  two  to  five  were  originally  targeted.  The \nfinancial  structure  was  based  on  a  50\u201350  risk-sharing  arrangement  between  ADB  and \nthe  selected  PFIs,  who  were  required  to  cover  the  remaining  risk  of  up  to  P1  billion. \nOther features of the facility are contained in Appendix 1.   \n \nC. \n\nProgress Highlights \n\nIn  September  2006,  ADB\u2019s  guarantee  committee  approved  the  inclusion  of \n6. \nSecurity Bank Corporation (SBC) as its first PFI under the PCG facility, with ADB and SBC \noperating  on  a  50\u201350  loss-sharing  basis.  The  guarantee  agreement  between  ADB  and \nSBC  was  signed  in  April  2007,  1  year  after  Board  approval  of  the  project.  The  PCG \nfacility for SBC was approved for a maximum amount of P500 million (50% of the total \nPCG  amount),  of  which  P100  million  was  allocated  to  Universal  Robina  Corporation \n(URC) as the principal for its distributors.3 Participants were URC\u2019s branded distributors, \nwhich were locally incorporated SMEs with sales turnover not exceeding P1 billion per \nyear.  \n \n7. \nADB  and  SBC  completed  all  documentation  and  compliance  requirements  in \nthe  second  half  of  2007.  The  first  transaction  under  the  facility  took  place  in  January \n2008,  and  utilization  increased  to  its  maximum  level  of  P98.8  million  (of  a  P100.0 \nmillion limit)  in February 2010. Thereafter, no new clients  were  added, and  utilization \ndropped  with  the  maturity  or  expiry  of  underlying  exposures.  The  last  transaction \nmatured  in  February  2011.  Under  the  P100  million  limit  for  URC  distributors,  16 \nqualifying  SME  URC  wholesalers  received  credit.  As  of  the  termination  date  of  the \nfacility on 26 April 2012, 65 qualifying instruments\u2014domestic standby letters of credit \n(DSLCs)  amounting  to  P430  million\u2014had  been  issued  by  SBC,  with  50%  of  the  credit \nexposure  guaranteed  by  ADB.  No  default  or  invocation  of  ADB\u2019s  guarantee  was \nrecorded.  In  February  2011,  nearly  3  years  after  the  first  transaction  with  SBC,  the \nPrivate  Sector  Operations  Department  (PSOD)  cancelled  the  unallocated  balance  of \nP500 million. The PCG facility was terminated in April 2012 at the end of the availability \nperiod. \n \n8. \nThe  proposed  $1  million  equity  investment  in  the  CIB  was  also  cancelled  in \nFebruary 2011 because the corporation established by the government  was a majority \n\n                                                      \n3   URC is a major food manufacturer in the Philippines and has a key market position in the domestic snack \nand  beverage  business.  URC  has  an  extensive  network  of  wholesale  distributors,  which  are  usually \naccredited after a rigorous assessment as exclusive agents for warehousing and distributing URC products \nin specified geographical areas. These distributors supply retail outlets. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n The Project \n\n \n\n  3 \n\nstate-owned  enterprise,  which  deviated  from  the  structure  originally  approved  in  the \nreport and recommendation of the President (RRP).4  \n \n9. \nThe  extended  annual  review  prepared  by  the  PSOD  in  April  2012  assessed \nimpact  of  the  PCG  facility  to  be less than satisfactory.  5  This  result  was  based  on less \nthan satisfactory  ratings  for  development  impact,  ADB  investment  profitability,  and \nADB work quality. ADB\u2019s additionality assessment was rated satisfactory. With regard to \ndevelopment impact assessment, private sector development and business success was \nrated  less than satisfactory,  economic  sustainability  was  rated  unsatisfactory,  and \ncompliance  with  environmental,  social,  health,  and  safety  performance  was  rated \nsatisfactory.  Monitoring  and  supervision  within  work  quality  assessment  was  rated \nunsatisfactory.  Key  lessons  learnt  were  that  the  PCG  facility,  with  minor  adjustments \nand  realignment,  could  be  adopted  and  rolled  out  in  most  ADB  developing  member \ncountries,  and  that  it  would  be  necessary  to  (i)  monitor  the  utilization  of  approved \nlimits;  (ii)  restructure,  realign,  and  modify  them  when  required,  and  (iii)  cancel \nallocations not using ADB capital efficiently.  \n \n\nKey lessons \u2013it \nwould be \nnecessary to (i) \nmonitor the \nutilization of \napproved limits; \n(ii) restructure, \nrealign, and \nmodify them \nwhen required, \nand (iii) cancel \nallocations not \nusing ADB \ncapital efficiently \n\n                                                      \n4   The CIB was renamed the Credit Information Corporation (CIC), which was established under Republic Act \n9510 (the Credit Information System Act) in 2008. The CIC is 60% owned by the national government and \n40% by  qualified investors defined  as industry association of banks, quasi-banks and  other credit-related \nassociations,  namely  the  Bankers  Association  of  the  Philippines,  the  Philippine  Cooperative  Center,  the \nCredit Card Association of the Philippines, the Chamber of Thrift Banks, the Rural Bankers Association of \nthe Philippines,  and  the Philippine Credit Reporting Alliance.  Under the law, the government has  5  years \nfrom the start of operations to dispose of at least 20% of CIC\u2019s shares to investors. Guardianship of the CIC \nis under the Philippines Securities and Exchange Commission and not the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) \nas  originally  proposed.

The investment is evaluated according to \n(i) development  outcomes and  impact, (ii) ADB investment  profitability, (iii) ADB work \nquality, and (iv) ADB additionality.  \n \nB. \n\nProject Rationale and Objectives \n\n11. \nThe  rationale  and  objectives  of  the  PCG  facility  were  to  improve  the  enabling \nenvironment  for  SMEs  and  facilitate  their  increased  access  to  finance.  This  facility \nsupported  the  Government  of  the  Philippines\u2019  policies  and  plans  to  create  at  least  6 \nmillion jobs in 6 years by promoting SMEs, tripling financing available, and developing \nland  for  agribusiness.  The  facility  was  designed  to  support  the  needs  of  SMEs,  and  it \nfocused  on  enhancing  access  to  long-term  capital  by  PFIs  and  SMEs.  The  facility  was \ndesigned  to  encourage  PFIs  to  allocate  credit  to  SMEs  through  the  use  of  innovative \nrisk-sharing arrangements.  \n \nThe PCG facility was intended to encourage banks to change the basis of their \n12. \nlending  to  SME  borrowers  from  securing  loans  according  to  the  value  and  quality  of \ncollateral  based  on  fixed  and  movable  assets,  to  collateral  based  on  SME  cash  flows. \nThis  arrangement  would  have  addressed  the  problem  of  limited  access  to  finance \nresulting  from  banks\u2019  more  conventional  collateral-based  lending  approach  based  on \nfixed and movable assets.  \n \n13. \nPCG-guaranteed  exposures  carry  a  zero  risk  weight  in  computing  regulatory \ncapital  requirements  on  banks.7  PFIs  were  expected  to  increase  their  lending  capacity \nwithout  needing  more  capital,  exceeding  exposure  limits,  or  breaching  prudent \nunderwriting  criteria.  The  PCG  facility  was  envisioned  by  ADB  to  help  banks  improve \ntheir capital efficiency and loan portfolio diversity. These developments were expected \nto make commercial banks more willing and able to lend to SMEs.  \n\n                                                      \n6   ADB. 2014. Guidelines for Preparing Performance Evaluation Reports on Nonsovereign Operations. Manila. \n7  The  credit  risk  weights,  for  each  asset  class  under  BSP\u2019s  implementation  of  the  Basel  II  capital  adequacy \nframework,  have  been  defined  in  BSP\u2019s  new  risk-based  capital  adequacy  framework.  Under  this \narrangement, when a bank\u2019s exposure is guaranteed by a qualified guarantor\u2014in this case ADB, which has \nan  AAA  external  credit  rating\u2014the  bank  is  allowed  to  apply  the  risk  weight  of  the  guarantor  to  the \nguaranteed portion of the credit exposure throughout the term of the guarantee. This reduces the capital \nrequirements for the facility. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n  Evaluation \n\n \n\n  5 \n\nThe  proposed  equity  investment  in  the  CIB  was  a  complementary  facility  that \n14. \nwas intended to improve the enabling environment for SMEs. The investment had been \ntargeted for the end of 2005, when legislation was expected to have been passed and \ninvestments  finalized  by  all  sponsors.  The  main  product  of  the  CIB  was  to  have  been \nconsolidated  credit  information  that  would  have  allowed  the  CIB  to  improve  the \nsharing and dissemination of information through a credit information system that was \nintended  to: (i) improve the ability of lenders  to  identify good borrowers; (ii) create a \nbetter  risk  management  process;  (iii) \nlending;  (iv)  extend  credit  to \nunderserviced sectors of micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises; and (v) strengthen \ncredit discipline, leading to the lowering of defaults.   \n\nincrease \n\n \n\n1. \n\n \nOverview \n\nDevelopment Impact and Outcomes \n\nC. \n \n \n \nThe overall development impact and outcome is rated unsatisfactory based on \n15. \ncomponent  ratings  of  unsatisfactory  for  private  sector  development,  less  than \nsatisfactory  for  business  success,  unsatisfactory  for  contribution  to  economic \ndevelopment,  and  satisfactory \nfor  environmental,  social,  health,  and  safety \nperformance.  \n \n \n \n2. \n \nPrivate  sector  development  is  assessed  under  two  categories  (i)  beyond \n16. \ncompany  impacts  and  (ii)  direct  company  impacts.  Based  on  component  ratings  of \nunsatisfactory  for  both  of  these  categories,  private  sector  development  is  rated \nunsatisfactory.  Appendix  2  summarizes  the  private  sector  development  indicators  and \nratings. \n \n\nPrivate Sector Development \n\nBeyond Company Impacts \n\na. \n\n \n\nThe  beyond  company  impacts  of  the  project  are  discussed  according  to:  (i) \n(iii) \n\n(ii)  demonstration  or  catalytic \n\nimpact,  and \n\n17. \nenhanced \nlending  to  SMEs, \nestablishment of and support for the CIB. \n \n\ni.  Enhanced Lending to SMEs \n\n   \n\n18. \nThe  PCG  facility,  which  was  part  of  the  broader  intervention  for  SME \ndevelopment as envisaged in the RRP, had ambitious objectives to (i) improve access by \nSMEs  to financing  to  promote  their operations,  profitability, and competitiveness and \n(ii)  contribute  to  private  sector  development  and  sustainable  economic  and \nemployment  growth  in  the  Philippines.  The  project\u2019s  intended  outcomes  were  to \nincrease PFI lending to SMEs (in terms of borrowers and lending volume) and introduce \nnew and innovative products in the Philippine banking  system to improve SME access \nto  finance.  The  project  had  a  tenor  of  5  years,  and  the  maximum  tenor  of  the \nguarantees was 3 years. The facility therefore had the potential  to create a significant \ndevelopment  impact  on  SMEs.  The  ADB  Board  observed  that  finding  new  SMEs  and \ndeveloping their institutional capacity was more important to the success of the project \nthan increasing the size of the credit line being offered to SMEs.   \n \n\nThe project\u2019s \nintended \noutcomes were \nto increase PFI \nlending to SMEs \n\n\f \n\n6  Small and Medium Enterprise Development Support Project \n\n \n \n19. \nSBC  was  the  only  participating  banking  institution,  DSLCs  were  the  only \nguaranteed financial instrument, and URC wholesale distributors were the only types of \nSMEs supported under the project. Facility utilization peaked at  nearly P100 million in \nFebruary 2010, which represented only about 10% of the approved limit.8 This amount \nwas well below ADB\u2019s expectations, considering the facility had an availability period of \n5  years.  The  lack  of  demand  for  the  product  could  be  attributed  to  various  reasons, \nincluding: (i) ADB\u2019s lack of success in identifying more financial institutions that could \nhave benefited from such a facility,  (ii) ADB delays in responding to SBC\u2018s requests for \nan increase in the limit for URC distributors  when the P100 million limit was reached, \nand  (iii)  SBC\u2019s  lack  of  understanding  that  the  facility  could  have  been  used  for \nguaranteeing SME term lending facilities as well as DSLCs. Also, even though SBC tried \nto  get  its  other  distributor  clients  to  use  the  remaining  P400  million  of  the  facility, \nmany  of  the  distributors  did  not  bank  with  SBC  and  were  unwilling  to  change  their \nbanking arrangements.  SBC issued 65 DSLCs amounting to P430 million, but this  only \namounted to about 0.1% of the estimated SME lending of all commercial banks in the \nPhilippines, which had outstanding balances of P408 billion at the end of 2011.    \n \n\nii.  Demonstration or Catalytic Impact   \n\n \n\nThe PCG facility \nwas expected to \nhave a catalytic \neffect based on \nits uptake by \nvarious PFIs to \nservice a variety \nof SMEs and \nsatisfy a number \nof financing \nrequirements \n\nThe PCG facility was expected to have a catalytic effect based on its uptake by \n20. \nvarious  PFIs  to  service  a  variety  of  SMEs  and  satisfy  a  number  of  financing \nrequirements. However, utilization  was very low and of limited extent and scope.  SBC \nwas  the  only  PFI  that  participated  in  the  project,  and  only  one  of  its  clients  (URC\u2019s \nbranded  distributors)  participated  in  the  project,  accounting  for  less  than  10% \nutilization  of  the  entire  approved  limit.  Once  the  P100  million  limit  was  reached,  SBC \nstopped  using  the  facility  for  URC  distributors  because  of  slow  response  times  on \nrequests made to ADB to increase the limit allocated for URC from P100 million to P250 \nmillion.  Another  reason  for  the  low  utilization  was  the  reorganization  of  URC\u2019s \ndistribution  network,  which  reduced  the  number  of  distributors  and  encouraged \nexclusive arrangements with larger  distributors. Demand for  the facility  from SBC and \nURC  fell,  leading  to  limited  demonstration  impacts.  The  approach  of  guaranteeing \nDSLCs  has  been  continued  by  SBC  using  its  own  resources  after  closure  of  the  ADB \ntransaction.   \n \n\niii.  Establishment and Support for the Credit Information Bureau  \n\n \n21. \nThe  proposed  equity  investment  in  the  CIB  was  cancelled  in  February  2011 \nbecause the ownership structure deviated from the originally approved structure in the \nRRP.  The  Credit  Information  Corporation  (CIC)  was  established  in  2008  as  a \ngovernment-owned  and  controlled  corporation  with  60%  of  its  shares  owned  by  the \npublic  sector.  In  the  RRP  it  was  envisaged  that  the  CIC  would  be  established  as  a \nmajority privately owned corporation. The actual CIC ownership structure reflected the \nwishes of the government to have a majority (60%) ownership initially, but to gradually \nreduce  its  share  by  20%  over  5  years.  It  is  not  clear  why  this  risk  was  not  picked  up \nduring  the  initial  due  diligence,  as  it  meant  that  the  CIC  would  not  be  eligible  for \nnonsovereign equity funding. At approval, the target date for the ADB investment was \nthe end of 2005,  as soon as legislation had been passed and investments finalized by \nall sponsors.  \n\n                                                      \n8   P98.4 million was utilized out of the of the approved ADB limit of P1 billion for allocation among selected \n\nPFIs.    \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n  Evaluation \n\n \n\n  7 \n\n \nGuardianship  of  the  CIC  is  assigned  to  the  Philippines  Securities  and  Exchange \nCommission and not the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) as originally proposed in the \nRRP.  Legislation  was  passed  in  2008,  and  the  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission \nsubmitted  the  proposed  rules  and  guidelines  for  the  establishment  of  the  CIC  to  the \nCongressional Oversight Committee for review in May 2009.  The CIC regulations were \napproved in January 2010,  and the board of CIC was set up in 2010 with the chair of \nthe  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission  as  its  head.  In  November  2012,  the \nInternational  Finance  Corporation  and  CIC  signed  an  agreement  for  the  provision  of \nadvisory  services  to  support  the  establishment  of  a  credit  information  system  in  line \nwith  international  best  practice  standards.  The  assistance  is  scheduled  for  completion \nby  December  2014,  at  which  time  the  CIC  is  expected  to  be  fully  operational.  As  the \ninvestment never happened, the proposed equity investment by ADB in the CIC did not \ncontribute to improving the enabling environment for SMEs. \n \n22. \nIn the absence of the PCG\u2019s greater utilization and wider adoption through the \ninclusion  of  other  PFIs  and  different  instruments  under  the  amount  allocated  to  SBC, \n\nthe  facility\u2019s  impact  on  private  sector  development  was  limited  and  well  below \nexpectations. Furthermore, the investment in the CIB never happened (para. 21). Hence, \nthe beyond company impact is rated unsatisfactory. \n \n\n   \n\nDirect Company Impacts \n\nb. \n\n \n\n23. \nSBC was the only one bank that participated in the project. The expected direct \ncompany impacts of the PCG facility on SBC were an increase in its lending to SMEs and \nan  improvement  in  its  operating  standards.  These  impacts  should  be  assessed  within \nthe context of the size of the PCG facility, which was underutilized, and the lack of PFIs \nparticipating in the project.  \n \nFrom 2006 to 2011,9 the outstanding balances of  SBC\u2019s  loans to micro, small, \n24. \nand medium-sized enterprises were fairly constant at about 12% of its customer loans. \nOutstanding  balances  increased  from  P4  billion  to  P11  billion,  a  compound  annual \ngrowth  rate  of  23%.  For  micro  and  small  enterprises,  however,  outstanding  balances \ndecreased  from  P2.3  million  at  the  end  of  2006  to  P2.0  billion  at  the  end  of  2011.10 \nGrowth  was  clearly  occurring  within  the  medium-sized  enterprise  sector,  and  the  PCF \nfacility was designed to support this growth. However, the amount guaranteed under \nthe project was small relative to the scale of lending, and it was restricted to one kind \nof SME: the URC distributors. SBC was unaware that the facility could  also be used to \nguarantee other SME term loans.   \n \nADB\u2019s PCG had limited impact on SBC operations and its corporate governance \n25. \nfor  three  reasons.  (i)  ADB  imposed  a  P100  million  limit  on  guarantees  for  the  loans \ninitiated by the primary borrower (URC) since it was an unknown entity at the time of \napproval. The limit was reached in 2010, and it took ADB about 15 months to respond \nto requests by SBC for an increase, at which time internal financing had been provided \nto  continue  the  loan  program  for  URC.  The  PCG  facility  was  set  up  to  cover  PFIs\u2019 \nselected SME exposures, with recourse to the underlying SME assets and not the PFIs\u2019 \nassets.  However,  during  the  course  of  the  project,  there  was  a  change  in  PSOD \n\n                                                      \n9   Data for 2011 was the latest available. A number of requests were made to SBC for later figures, but they \n\nwere not provided. \n\n10  See footnote number 9. \n\nSBC was the only \none bank that \nparticipated in \nthe project \n\n\f \n\n8  Small and Medium Enterprise Development Support Project \n\n \n \nmanagement preference in taking financial intermediary risk rather than risk associated \nwith SMEs (ii) Newly formed Office of Risk Management requested SBC to share its risk \nrating model, but because of confidentiality issues, some of the required data was not \nshared  by  SBC  with  ADB.  This  lack  of  disclosure  might  have  contributed  to \nunderutilization  of  the  facility  and  resulted  in  ADB  not  aggressively  pursuing  new \nopportunities  and  (iii)  SBC  did  not  fully  understand  the  potential  of  the  project  and \nonly used the facility to provide guarantees for DSLCs. SBC never realized it could also \nuse ADB\u2019s PCG to guarantee general SME term lending, and this also limited the use of \nthe facility.   \n \n26. \nBefore  the  project,  many  of  the  SME  distributors  benefiting  from  the  PCG \nfacility  had  not  previously  borrowed  from  SBC.  Although  SBC  indicated  it  may  have \nfinanced  the  distributors  even  without  the  ADB  facility,  it  became  more  comfortable \nwith these SMEs and extended other credit facilities to them. The PCG facility improved \nSME access to finance (e.g., general lines of credit, bill purchase limits, and short-term \nreceivables  financing),  which  supported  the  growth  of  the  distributors\u2019  businesses.  In \nsome cases, credit was given to other businesses of the borrowers\u2019 sponsor. ADB had \nno  appreciable  impact  on  SBC\u2019s  risk  systems  or  corporate  governance  because  of  its \nlimited interaction  with SBC as a result of frequent staff changes  within ADB and  the \nvery low utilization of the facility.   \n \n27. \nSince  exposure  under  the  PCG  facility  carries  zero  risk  weight  in  computing \nregulatory  capital  requirements,  SBC  increased  its  lending  capacity  under  the  PCG \nwithout  the  need  for  additional  capital.  This  effect  was  minimal,  however,  given  the \nsmall  size  and  limited  utilization  of  the  facility,  and  the  fact  that  SBC  had  acceptable \ncapital adequacy ratios well above BSP requirements and those adopted under Basel II. \n \nTransfer of skills to SBC personnel was minimal. While SBC staff learned about \n28. \nADB  procedures  and  processes,  frequently  changing  project  contacts  within  ADB  and \ndelays in responding resulted in limited skills transfer for SBC staff. \n \nA  select  few  SMEs  benefited  from  the  project  (with  most  securing  their  first \n29. \nloans  through  PCG  cover),  but  SBC  was  unable  to  utilize  the  full  allotted  facility  limit \nand  could  not  leverage  its  experience  with  URC  to  develop  a  wider  client  base  to  use \nthe facility. Due to the relatively small size of the project, it did not have any effect on \nSBC\u2019s capital efficiency. The direct impact on SBC is therefore rated unsatisfactory.  \n \n\nc.  Overall Assessment of Private Sector Development  \n\n \n30. \nADB\u2019s PCG facility was designed to enhance the financing capacity of SMEs, but \nit was restricted to one bank (SBC) and one instrument (DSLCs). The P1 billion allocated \nfor the facility was small compared to the needs of the sector.  ADB\u2019s expectation that \nthe  facility  would  be  utilized  by  a  number  of  PFIs  and  cover  a  range  of  SMEs  across \nsectors was not realized. \n \n31. \nOnly  half  of  the  facility  (P500  million)  was  disbursed,  and  this  disbursement \nwas only allocated to one PFI (SBC). Of this, only P100 million was utilized (10% of the \ntotal facility) by URC distributors. This limited set of borrowers significantly reduced the \n\nfacility\u2019s  demonstration  or  multiplier  potential.  Involving  other  PFIs  and  encouraging \nSBC  to  link  the  facility  with  other  similar  financing  arrangements  would  have  raised \n\nADB\u2019s \nexpectation that \nthe facility \nwould be \nutilized by a \nnumber of PFIs \nand cover a \nrange of SMEs \nacross sectors \nwas not realized \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n  Evaluation \n\n \n\n  9 \n\nawareness,  encouraged  utilization,  and  allowed  faster  recycling  of  ADB\u2019s  committed \ncapital over the life of the PCG facility. In the absence of these measures, the facility\u2019s \noverall effect on private sector development is rated unsatisfactory.  \n \n\n3. \n\nBusiness Success \n\n \n32. \nThe  profitability  of  SBC  and  the  impact  that  the  PCG  facility  made  on  a  few \nSMEs  are  positive  accomplishments.  There  were  no  defaults  or  invocation  of  ADB\u2019s \nguarantee.  Nevertheless, its  business  success  is  rated less than satisfactory  because  of \nthe small size of the investment and SBC\u2019s limited use of the facility. The PCG facility is \ntherefore unlikely to have made any significant impact on SBC\u2019s profitability.  \n \n33. \nThe PCG facility\u2019s financial performance and return on invested capital for SBC \nhas  been  reviewed  in  the  context  of  the  facility\u2019s  impact  on  the  intermediary  PFI  and \nthe  SMEs  that  benefited  from  enhanced  access  to  credit.  However,  this  assessment  is \nconstrained  by  the  small  size  of  the  facility,  its  low  utilization  relative  to  other \noperations  of  SBC,  and  the  lack  of  financial  information  available  on  the  beneficiary \nSMEs.  \n \n34. \nSince SBC\u2019s exposure to the SME  market is limited (about 12% of its customer \nloans  outstanding  on  average)  and  because  the  PCG  facility  made  only  a  small \ncontribution to its earnings, it is inappropriate to assess the impact of the PCG facility \non  SBC\u2019s  profitability.  In  terms  of  the  impact  on  SME  beneficiaries,  information  from \nSBC  has  shown  the  facility  helped  some  to  increase  their  sales  turnover  and  profits.11 \nMany  small  distributors  at  the  outset  became  much  larger  over  time,  and  a  number \nmerged or grew into regional wholesale distributors.  \n \n35. \nIn  terms  of  SBC\u2019s  return  on  investment  capital  and  financial  performance,  a \nseparate assessment is impractical given the small size of the facility. As a proxy, SBC\u2019s \nprofitability, which has been consistently above average among banks in Philippines, is \nused to estimate the return on invested capital.12 Average annual return on assets for \nSBC  was  2.8%  from  2006  to  2012,  while  the  average  annual  return  on  shareholder \nequity was 22.9% over the same period. \n   \n \n\n \n\n4. \n\nContribution to Economic Development \n\n \n36. \nEconomic  sustainability  is  rated  unsatisfactory.  The  PCG  facility  would  have \ngenerated new jobs, but because of its limited scale, this impact remained significantly \nbelow  expectations  and  contributed  minimally  to  the  development  of  the  local \neconomy. The PCG facility was used by only one bank, benefited only one set of SMEs, \nand  achieved  only  about  10%  utilization.  While  the  PCG  structure  supported  local \ncurrency  lending  to  SMEs,  it  has  not  been  replicated  since.  The  PCG\u2019s  contribution  to \neconomic development has been marginal.  \n\n                                                      \n11 Higher sales turnover and profits can be inferred from the changes in URC\u2019s policy toward its distributors, \nwhich  included  phasing  out  smaller  distributors  and  consolidating  business  with  fewer  distributors  with \nregional  coverage.  This  suggests higher  volumes  of  URC  business  for  these  entities.  The  extent  to which \nthis was directly linked with the impacts of the PCG facility cannot be determined. \n\n12  In its full rating report for SBC in October 2011, Fitch Ratings mentioned that SBC\u2019s profitability, measured \nas  return  on  assets,  has  historically  averaged  above  2.5%,  or  more  than  double  the  1.1%  of  local  peer \nbanks.  In  2012,  SBC  was the  top  private domestic  universal  bank  in  terms  of  its  return  on  shareholders\u2019 \nequity (22%) and its return on assets (3.3%). Security Bank 2012 Annual Report.   \n\nThere were no \ndefaults or \ninvocation of \nADB\u2019s guarantee \n\nThe PCG facility \nwas used by only \none bank, \nbenefited only \none set of SMEs, \nand achieved \nonly about 10% \nutilization \n\n\f10  Small and Medium Enterprise Development Support Project \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\n5. \n\nEnvironment, Social, Health, and Safety \n\n \nThe ADB PCG facility for SBC was categorized as a financial intermediary under \n37. \nADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy  (2002).  As  a  result,  subprojects  would  likely  not  have  had \nsignificant  impacts  on  the  environment,  involuntary  resettlement,  or  indigenous \npeoples. The classification is generally based on what business beneficiaries pursue, and \nthe  SMEs  supported  by  the  PCG  were  mainly  engaged  in  trading  activities.  The \nSupplemental Deed (No.1) to the Guarantee Facility Deed indicated that each qualifying \nSME  had  to  be  in  full  compliance  with  applicable  environmental  and  social safeguard \nlaws  and  regulations  and  not  engaged  in  any  activities  or  businesses  prohibited  in \n\nADB\u2019s  exclusion  list.  No  violation  of  Philippine  environment  laws  or  ADB\u2019s  list  of \nprohibited investments was reported.  \n \n38. \nSBC has its own environmental policy that requires an environmental clearance \ncertificate  on  projects  where  necessary  under  government  regulations.

For  this  project,  however,  there  were  no  other \napprovals  with  similar  project  and  country  risk  profiles.  The  pricing  of  the  guarantees \nwas negotiated with SBC at the time of documentation, and it was supposed to  have \nbeen based on the prevailing risks identified during due diligence and comparable fees \nderived  elsewhere.  There  were  no  defaults  or  invocation  of  ADB\u2019s  guarantee.  The \nfacility  was  grossly  underutilized.    ADB  investment  profitability  is  rated  less than \nsatisfactory.  \n\nE. \n\n \nADB Work Quality \n\nADB's  work  quality  is  rated unsatisfactory  in  terms  of  its  screening,  appraisal, \n40. \nand structuring of the project as well as its monitoring and supervision. For ADB\u2019s role \nand contribution, the rating is less than satisfactory.  \n \n\n1. \n\nScreening, Appraisal, and Structuring of the Project \n\n \n41. \nDue diligence was weak. Only one bank was advanced for participation at the \ntime of appraisal, and since time was limited, a decision was made to defer selection of \nother PFIs until after approval. There was a failure of ADB to sell the concept to other \nbanks.  ADB  had  initial  meetings  with  several  banks,13  including  SBC,  prior  to  Board \napproval,  but  these  discussions  were  not  advanced,  although  ADB  shared  the  project \nterm  sheet  with  them.  The  private  sector  loan  was  processed  alongside  other  public \nsector  components  as  part  of  a  larger  assistance  program  prepared  by  ADB.  Time \n\nTime constraints \nduring approval \nmeant that ADB \ndecided to \nidentify other \nPFIs after project \napproval \n\n                                                      \n13  Citibank, Standard Chartered, Unionbank, Planters Bank, and Banco De Oro. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n  Evaluation \n\n \n\n  11 \n\nconstraints during approval meant that ADB decided to identify other PFIs after project \napproval.14  Unfortunately,  there was not  much follow-up  by ADB  afterwards.  The first \nloss provision included in the RRP was never implemented as the guarantee agreement \nbetween SBC and ADB was silent on the issue. SBC considered the first loss provision to \nbe unworkable and requested ADB to drop the provision in the guarantee agreement. \nA  first  loss  provision  would  have  been  more  appropriate  for  SBC\u2019s  term  loans  rather \nthan  the  domestic  letters  of  credit  guarantees  under  the  project.  The  guarantee \nagreement  was  eventually  signed  1  year  after  Board  approval,  and  it  did  not  include \nthe first loss provision. Much of the delay occurred because of SBC\u2019s unfamiliarity with \nADB procedures and operations and the inadequate follow-up by ADB.     \n \n42. \nThe  concept  of  the  PCG  facility  was  aligned  with  government  and  ADB \nobjectives for encouraging SME sector development.  The decision to select  SBC as the \nfirst  bank  under  the  facility  in  2006  was  made  on  the  basis  of  limited  screening.  \nAlthough  SBC  had  an  acceptable  credit  profile,  was  profitable,  and  had  an  adequate \ncapital  structure,  its  SME  financing  had  been  relatively  small.15  At  appraisal,  SBC  was \nthe  15th  largest  bank  in  Philippines,  but  it  did  not  have  an  extensive  retail  branch \nnetwork,  and  it  lacked  established  relationships  with  SMEs.  It  was  expected  that  SBC \nwould  expand  its  SME  business  and  widen  its  associated  services.  However,  in  the \nabsence of businesses similar to URC that were willing to participate in the use of the \nPCG,  growth  in  SME  lending  by  SBC  was  below  expectations.  Furthermore,  the \nmisunderstanding between SBC and ADB on the wider use of the guarantee, especially \nfor term lending, also contributed to the low utilization of the facility.  \n \nBecause of the  low utilization,  the participation of  only one  bank, inadequate \n43. \npricing at the outset,  and the fact that ADB  did not apply  the first loss provision  that \nwas  included  in  the  RRP  approval  in  the  guarantee  agreement,  ADB's  performance  in \nscreening, appraisal, and structuring is rated unsatisfactory. \n \n\n2. \n\nMonitoring and Supervision \n\n \n44. \nThe shortfalls in monitoring and supervision of the PCG facility are illustrated by \nthe  lack  of  new  PFIs  being  selected  and  its  low  utilization.  Not  enough  was  done  to \nidentify  and  select  other  PFIs,  while  the  considerable  delay  in  following  up  on  the \nrequest of SBC to increase its allocation to URC contributed to the poor performance of \nthe facility. The constant changing of ADB staff contacts meant there was no continuity \nof supervision. Had there been better monitoring and supervision, the lack of progress \nwould have been identified earlier. Since monitoring and supervision was not proactive \nin identifying problems or issues, it is rated unsatisfactory.  \n \n\n3. \n\nADB's Role and Contribution \n\n \n45. \nThe  PCG  facility  was  structured  and  operated  in  line  with  ADB\u2019s  operating \nstrategies and  policies. However, efforts  to raise awareness and  encourage  use of  the \nfacility by other Philippine banks and other clients of SBC were below expectations.  \n \n\n                                                      \n14  At  the  time  there  was  a  rushed  schedule  for  approval,  since  the  PSOD  was  part  of  a  larger  project \nchampioned  by  the  Southeast  Asia  Regional  Department  that  was  ready  and  included  a  public  sector \ncomponent that had been prepared earlier.  \n\n15 In 2005, SBC did not have a well-defined SME portfolio and only had limited coverage. Its SME exposure, at \n\n$20 million, was less than 1% of its total customer loan portfolio. \n\nThe constant \nchanging of ADB \nstaff contacts \nmeant there was \nno continuity of \nsupervision \n\n\fADB\u2019s \nadditionality \nwould have \nbeen rated \nhigher if the \nfacility had been \nadopted by at \nleast a few more \nPFIs or benefited \na wider set of \nSME clients of \nSBC \n\n12  Small and Medium Enterprise Development Support Project \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n46. \nDelays in the approval of SBC\u2019s request to increase the allocation limits for URC \nwere  largely  due  to  insufficient  staff  resources  within  ADB  to  process  the  extensive \nnumber  of  documents  required  to  enroll  each  new  SME.  When  the  P100  million  limit \nwas  reached,  URC  stopped  enrolling  new  distributors  and  ADB  did  not  intervene  to \ncreate additional capacity. Also, as part of its approval process, the newly formed Office \nof  Risk  Management  requested  that  SBC  share  its  risk  rating  model,  but  some  of  the \nrequired data was not provided.  This might have contributed to ADB\u2019s slow response. \nNevertheless,  ADB  should  have  undertaken  better  due  diligence  at  appraisal,  which \nmight have enabled it to delegate authority to SBC to enroll each new distributor.  \n \n47. \nPSOD  was  not  keen  to  take  direct  SME  risk,  preferring  financial  intermediary \nrisk.  This  might  have  ultimately  contributed  to  underutilization  of  the  facility,  as  new \nopportunities  were  not  aggressively  pursued.  Since  ADB  could  have  done  more  and \nbeen better organized, its role and contribution is rated less than satisfactory. \n \nF. \n\nADB Additionality   \n\n48. \nThe  concept  was  innovative  and  had  the  potential  to  leverage  ADB  funds  for \nSMEs  if  it  had  been  implemented  more  effectively.  The  weak  monitoring  by  ADB,  its \nrequirements  for  data  that  proved  impossible  for  SBC  to  provide  on  grounds  of \nconfidentiality,  the  changes  of  staff  and  policies  within  the  PSOD,  and  the  failure  to \nidentify new PFIs all point to less than satisfactory performance. \n  \n49. \n \n50. \n\nADB took the initiative in designing and structuring the facility and  undertook \n\nADB has not applied the PCG to other projects in the Philippines or elsewhere.  \n\nall  screening  and  appraisal.

For  projects  where \nsimilar models do not exist in the local market, more exhaustive studies and analyses of \nthe demand and willingness to pay for guarantees covering SME exposure should take \nplace. \n\n \n\n54. \nAn adequate pipeline is needed. More care is needed in establishing a pipeline \nof  PFIs.  Due  diligence  was  weak,  preventing  the  participation  of  more  banks  before \napproval or immediately afterwards. Given more participants, the volume of guarantees \nwould  have  increased  and  a  wider  variety  of  SMEs  could  have  taken  part.  More \nexhaustive due diligence is needed in the future, especially in identifying and assessing \nPFIs.  Poor  monitoring  and  supervision  of  the  project  by  ADB  contributed  to  the  low \nutilization  of  the  facility.  ADB  should  have  been  able  to  identify  the  issues,  problems, \nand  lack  of  progress  more  effectively,  and  it  should  have  been  more  flexible  in \nchanging the project during implementation.  \n \n55. \nPricing  needs  to  reflect  market  demand.  The  formal  price  change  from  ADB \ncame too late to make a difference, since by then  the price waivers had been granted. \nLikewise  the  first  loss  provision  outlined  in  the  RRP  was  dropped  from  the  guarantee \nagreement between ADB and SBC.  \n \nLack  of  replicability.  There  has  neither  been  a  follow-up  project  in  the \n56. \nPhilippines, nor has ADB financed a similar project elsewhere in the Asia Pacific region. \nThe  issue  of  taking  on  SME  risk  against  that  of  the  financial  intermediary  needs \nresolution before its further application.  The PCG facility could  potentially  be adopted \nin  a  number  of  ADB\u2019s  developing  member  countries,  but  further  work  is  required  to \nadequately  measure  and  assess  the  risk-return  benefits  of  the  instrument  for \nstakeholders.  Many  variations  are  possible,  such  as  different  stop-loss \nlevels; \ndifferentiated risk sharing; financial instruments for different uses (e.g., trade financing, \nequipment  purchases,  and  other  capital  investment);  and  working  capital.  Some  of \nthese  adjustments  can  be  explored  to  assess  whether  the  PCG  can  be  made  more \nflexible and better tailored to local conditions. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nThe issue of \ntaking on SME \nrisk against that \nof the financial \nintermediary \nneeds resolution \nbefore its further \napplication \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\nIssues, Lessons, and Recommendations \n\n \n\n  15 \n\n \n\n \n57. \nUnderestimating  the  impact  of  staff  changes.  PSOD  preferred  to  assume \nfinancial intermediary risk rather than risk associated with SMEs, which contributed to \nthe  delay  in  raising  the  credit  limit  to  URC  and  the  selection  of  new  PFIs.  ADB  staff \nchanges  at  the  project  officer  level  confused  SBC  and  contributed  to  the  lack  of \ncontinuity and consistency of efforts by ADB. \n \n58. \nBetter  due  diligence  of  financial  intermediaries  is  required.  ADB  did  not \nadequately assess the risk rating process of SBC  or  do enough work  to understand its \nprocesses and procedures. A better understanding of SBC would have enabled ADB to \nassume  more  decision-making  responsibility  on  the  implementation  of  the  facility.  In \naddition,  ADB  should  have  undertaken  due  diligence  of  other  potential  PFIs  at \nappraisal. Leaving the decision  to SBC  about  which  SMEs could participate would not \nhave  required  extensive  ADB  staff  involvement  after  PFI  selection  and  might  have \nencouraged other banks to participate. \n \nNeed  to  proactively  monitor  facility  utilization.  The  need  for  effective \n59. \nmonitoring was stressed in the RRP, but it was not carried our satisfactorily. Monitoring \nfacility utilization was necessary to guide restructuring, realignment, and modifications, \nand,  where  required,  to  cancel  allocations  so  ADB  capital  could  be  deployed  more \nefficiently. ADB originally expected that over  time, the PCG facility would allow PFIs to \nbecome  familiar  with  SME  risks  and  provide  guarantees  for  a  wider  range  of \ninstruments,  which  would  have  prompted  more  PFIs  to  participate.  This  outcome \nwould  have  required  better  and  more  proactive  monitoring  of  the  utilization  of  the \nfacility, which would have prompted the inclusion of new PFIs and allowed for a wider \nset of clients and instruments to be tested. Although the PCG facility was approved and \nmade available to partner banks for 8 years, ineffective monitoring led to cancellations \nrather than the reallocation of guarantees, availability periods, and tenors.   \n \nB. \n\nRecommended Follow-up Actions \n\nThree actions are recommended for future projects.  \n\n60. \n \n61. \nImprove due diligence and screening. ADB should identify, select, and sign up a \nnumber of PFIs before approval of future projects. Appropriate  screening and rigorous \ndue  diligence  of  their  lending  processes  and  practices,  risk  management  systems, \ncollateral  requirements,  debt  recovery  procedures,  financial  performance,  and  SME \nmarket profiles would enable future participants to assume more autonomy in decision \nmaking  and  reduce  the  burden  on  ADB  back  office  support.  A  pipeline  of  PFIs  and \npotential SME clients and a pricing structure for the PCG facility that reflects prevailing \nmarket conditions and practices should be determined and agreed before the approval \nof future projects. \n \nMake  the  transaction  more  replicable.  The  implementation  of  the  PCG  facility \n62. \nwas an innovative approach that could be modified to better reflect stakeholder (SMEs, \nfinancial  institutions,  and  ADB)  requirements.  These  modifications  could  include \ngranting more autonomy in decision making to the PFIs,  offering better market-based \npricing  for  the  facility,  and  promoting  its  wider  use  to  cover  guarantees  for  term \nlending  to  SMEs  as  well  as  covering  DSLCs.  These  changes  could  help  make  the \ntransaction more replicable.    \n \n\nA pipeline of \nPFIs for the PCG \nfacility should be \ndetermined and \nagreed before \nthe approval of \nfuture projects \n\n\f \n\n16  Small and Medium Enterprise Development Support Project \n\n \n \nImprove monitoring capacity.  ADB  needs  to  improve  its  monitoring  of  project \n63. \nprogress  and  be  more \nto  changes  needed  during \nresponding \nimplementation.  More  effective  follow-up  and  interaction  with  PFIs  by  ADB  staff  is \nessential  to  identify  problems  and  issues  before  they  become  serious  and  delay \nimplementation. More back office staff time should be allocated in future projects.     \n \n\nflexible \n\nin \n\n\f \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nAppendixes \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n \n\n \n\nAPPENDIX 1: PROJECT HIGHLIGHTS AND IMPLEMENTATION \n\nA. \n\nProject Highlights \n\n1. \n\nBackground  \n\n1. \nThe Small and Medium  Enterprise Development Support  Project  was  the Asian Development \nBank  (ADB)  response  to  a  request  from  the  Government  of  the  Philippines  to  support  small  and \nmedium-sized  enterprise  (SME)  development  as  part  of  the  government\u2019s  effort  to  reduce  poverty \nthrough private sector development and employment generation. The project\u2019s impact was to improve \nSME contributions to economic growth and employment, and its outcome was to improve the enabling \nenvironment for SMEs and facilitate greater access to finance. This aligned with the 10-point agenda of \nthe  government\u2019s  Medium-Term  Philippine  Development  Plan  2004\u20132010,  which  targeted  creating  at \nleast 6 million jobs in 6 years.1  \n \n2. \nA  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  analyzed  the  status  of  SMEs  in  the  Philippines, \nincluding the government\u2019s development policies and actions, and the issues and constraints facing the \nsector.2  The  study  found  that  SMEs  contributed  32%  to  value  addition  and  accounted  for  31%  of \nemployment.  Despite  the  sector\u2019s  significant  contributions,  SME  operation  has  been  constrained  by \npoor  access  to  finance  as  a  result  of  (i)  banks\u2019  reluctance  to  expand  their  SME  lending  following  the \nAsian  financial crisis  because  of  a  perceived  higher  cost  and  risk,  and  (ii)  the  difficulties  SMEs  face  in \npreparing  and  presenting  credible  business  plans  and  realistic  cash  flow  estimates,  and  in  providing \nacceptable  collateral.  Commercial  banks  generally  secure  SME  lending  on  formal  collateral  (e.g.,  hard \nassets and chattel mortgages) rather than on project cash flows or future revenues. \n \n3. \nThe  project  was  designed  to  support  the  findings  of  the  project  preparatory  technical \nassistance  and  was  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  country  strategy  and  program  update,  2004\u20132006  for  the \nPhilippines,3  which  focused  on  public\u2013private  partnerships  for  sustainable  SME  development.  The \nproject was designed to support SME development through (i) a credit line  of $25 million to the Small \nBusiness Guarantee and Finance Corporation for relending to SMEs, (ii) a partial credit guarantee (PCG) \nof P1 billion to other commercial banks to expand their SME portfolios, and (iii) an equity investment of \n$1  million  in  a  proposed  credit  information  bureau  (CIB).  The  credit  line  was  to  be  backed  by  a \nguarantee from the Republic of the Philippines as the public component of ADB\u2019s intervention. The PCG \nfacility and the equity investment  were structured  as  a private  transaction and  are the subject of  this \nevaluation.  \n\n2. \n\nKey Features \n\n \n4. \nThe PCG facility was structured as a revolving local currency credit enhancement instrument in \nfavor  of  local  participating  financial  institutions  (PFIs)  that  guaranteed  agreed  risks  associated  with \ntheir portfolios of loans or other credit exposure, including guarantees or letters of credit extended to \nSME  borrowers  selected  according  to  specified  criteria.  The  PCG  facility  aimed  to  encourage  PFIs  to \nassume  exposure  to  medium-sized  enterprises,  while  the  $25  million  public  sector  loan  to  the  Small \nBusiness Guarantee and Finance  Corporation focused on microenterprises and other small enterprises. \nThis split was undertaken to widen the reach of ADB\u2019s SME development program.  \n \n5. \nThis  PCG  was  structured  to  encourage  the  participation  of  PFIs  by  limiting  their  risk  with \nrecourse limited only to the underlying guaranteed portfolio and not to the PFIs\u2019 balance sheet. While a \n\n                                                      \n1 National Economic and Development Authority. 2005. Medium-Term Philippine Development Plan, 2004\u20132010.

Manila \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nProject Highlights and Implementation  19 \n\n5  \n\nPFI  faced  operating  and  indirect  credit  risk,4  this  risk  was  reduced  by  the  PFI\u2019s  specifying  portfolio \nexposure  and  selection  criteria  for  the  SMEs  for  which  ADB  would  assume  risk,  and  selection  and \nmonitoring. The facility was intended for  primarily top-tier domestic banks and finance institutions  in \nthe  Philippines  with  some  experience  in  SME  lending  and  well-established  underwriting  procedures. \nSome of them were accredited in ADB\u2019s Trade Finance Facilitation Program.\n \n6. \nUnder the facility, ADB set a limit of P1 billion to be allocated among selected PFIs, with 50\u2013\n50 risk-sharing agreement requiring PFIs to guarantee P1 billion. The limit for each PFI was set at P500 \nmillion. ADB intended to negotiate a provision of first loss assumed entirely by the PFI. The amount of \nfirst  loss  cover  was  to  be  based  on  the  loss  experience  of  each  PFI  over  the  preceding  3  years.6  The \nunderlying  rationale  for  proposing  a  first  loss  provision  was  to  better  ensure  complete  alliance  of \ninterest. \n \nA maximum exposure per borrower was set at P25.0 million, translating to a maximum ADB \n7. \nguarantee of P12.5 million per borrower. The selection criteria for SME borrowers were defined by the \nPFI and ADB. The SME had to be a branded distributor of Universal Robina Corporation (URC), have a \nsales turnover not exceeding P1 billion, and be locally incorporated. URC was tasked to undertake due \ndiligence  through  an  independent  valuation  of  each  distributor.  Each  distributor  should  have  had  at \nleast  2  years  of  trading  history  with  URC  or  been  in  the  distributor  business  servicing  its  current \ngeographic area for  at least 2  years.  In addition,  each distributor  should have been profitable for  the \npreceding  2  years  and  must  be  in  full  compliance  with  relevant  environmental  and  social  safeguard \nlaws and regulations and not engage in any business on the Exclusion List.7 These arrangements were \ncritical  since,  unlike  other  credit  facilities,  the  PCG  exposed  ADB  to  the  credit  risk  of  the  portfolio  of \nSMEs selected through the  normal  underwriting  practices of the PFI. There was a maximum loss limit \nunder the facility, which was to function as a trigger and allow ADB to review the continuation of the \nfacility if losses or claims under the guarantee exceeded anticipated amounts.  \n  \n8. \nThe  PCG  facility  was  available  for  5  years,  with  the  maximum  loan  tenor  capped  at  3  years, \neffectively making the facility available for 8 years. Pricing was to be determined for each transaction \nbased on ADB\u2019s share of exposure booked under the facility, which was capped at 50% of the nominal \namount. The pricing of the project was negotiated with Security Bank Corporation (SBC) at the time of \ndocumentation based on the prevailing risks identified during due diligence.  \n\nB. \n\nImplementation \n\nADB had initial meetings with a number of banks,8 including SBC, prior to Board approval, but \n9. \nthese discussions were not advanced, although ADB shared the project term sheet with them. Since the \npublic sector component was ready for appraisal and the private sector one was only added later, time \nconstraints meant that ADB decided to identify other PFIs after project approval. Unfortunately, there \nwas limited follow-up by ADB after loan approval, largely because of limited back office staff resources. \n  \n10. \nBoard approval of the project was in September 2005. The selection of SBC as the first PFI was \nendorsed  by  the  guarantee  committee  in  September  2006.  The  Guarantee  Facility  Deed  was  signed \nwith SBC for a maximum amount of P500 million in April 2007.  \n \n\n                                                      \n4   In an indirect manner, insolvency or a material weakening in the credit standing of a PFI would weaken its ability to monitor \nthe portfolio of guaranteed exposures and maintain specified  portfolio parameters, thereby increasing the default risk of the \nportfolio and ADB\u2019s risk as a partial guarantor. \n\n5  ADB. 2003.

Under the \n11. \nPCG, ADB provided a 50% guarantee on the DSLCs issued by SBC on behalf of these SMEs in favor of \nURC.9  URC  required  these  qualifying  instruments  (the  DSLCs)  under  the  facility  agreement  to  extend \ntrade  credit  to  the  SMEs.10  Distributors  were  selected  according  to  a  prescribed  set  of  credit  policies \nand  procedures  adopted  by  SBC  in  consultation  with  ADB.  SBC  directly  assumed  50%  of  the  DSLC \namount.  \n \n12. \nDocumentation  between  ADB and SBC (the supplemental  deed of the  guarantee) outlined a \nnumber  of  eligibility  requirements  for  URC  distributors\u2019  inclusion  in  the  facility  to  (i)  ensure  that  SBC \nused  the  facility  solely  for  lending  to  SMEs\u2014setting  a  sales  turnover  threshold  of  P1  billion  per \nannum\u2014and  (ii)  mitigate  the  credit  risk  to  ADB\u2014all  short-listed  distributors  were  to  have  at  least  2 \nyears of either dealing with URC or related business experience in their current geographical areas, and \nhave  been  operating  profitably  for  the  past  2  years  with  positive  retained  earnings.  In  addition,  SBC \nsubjected every transaction to independent due diligence before recommending it to ADB for approval.  \n \n13. \nAs facility utilization rose almost to the approved limit, SBC  requested in November 2009 an \nincrease  in  the  amount  allocated  to  URC  distributors  from  P100  million  to  P250  million,  which  was \nwithin SBC\u2019s P500  million approved limit. However,  the Private Sector Operations Department (PSOD) \ndid not respond until 15 months later. By that time there had been a steady drop in utilization because \nSBC  had  stopped  enrolling  new  distributors  into  the  project  on  the  advice  of  ADB,  which  had \nrecommended postponing new enrollments of instruments to stay within the prescribed amount.    \n \n14. \nIn January 2011, ADB  indicated  to SBC that  it could resume  access to the P100 million limit \nsince  utilization  had  fallen  below  the  limit  since  February  2010.  However,  SBC  still  failed  to  use  the \nallocated amount, and no new transactions were booked by SBC for URC dealers. Although it tried with \nother  entities,  SBC  did  not  formally  propose  any  new  participants  to  use  the  remaining  P400  million. \nSBC failed to introduce new participants because the pricing of the guarantee was considered to be too \nexpensive,  and  many  of  the  distributors  did  not  bank  with  SBC  and  were  unwilling  to  change  their \nbanking arrangements. Also, SBC mistakenly thought the facility could only be used for DSLCs.  \n \n15. \nAnother reason for the lower utilization in 2011 was the reorganization of URC\u2019s distribution \nnetwork, which reduced the number of distributors and encouraged exclusive arrangements with larger \ndistributors.  Although  the  volume  of  business  handled  by  URC  distributors \nincreased,  this \nreorganization reduced the number of distributors eligible for ADB\u2019s agreed guarantee coverage (based \non  turnover),  although  current  participants  remained  eligible  even  if  their  turnover  was  greater  than \nthe limit. However, URC\u2019s demand for the facility fell with no new enrollments.  \n \n  \n17. \nUnder  the  P100  million  limit  for  URC  distributors,  16  qualifying  SME  wholesalers  received \ncredit support under the PCG facility after it became effective in 2007. By April 2012, SBC had issued 65 \nDSLCs  to  the  16  distributors  amounting  to  P430  million,  50%  of  which  was  guaranteed  by  ADB.  No \ndefault or invocation of ADB\u2019s guarantee has been recorded.11  \n \n18. \nIn February 2011, the PSOD cancelled the remaining unallocated balance of P500 million. The \ncancellation note observed that no other  suitable banks had been selected as a facility PFI because of \n\n                                                      \n9  These  SMEs  were  branded  customer  food  and  beverage  group  distributors  of  URC  incorporated  in  the  Philippines  and  with \n\nannual sales turnover not exceeding P1 billion. \n\n10  In more conventional terms, this is a typical channel financing arrangement, wherein a relatively strong and well-established \nentity supports the financing of its distribution or channel partners by entering into a distribution or dealership arrangement \nwith them.  This  strengthens  the distributors\u2019  business  and  financial  profiles  and  provides  a  more  secure  basis  for  a  bank  to \nextend credit. \n\n11  ADB. 2012.

There  was  no  further \njustification  for  these  statements,  which  are  inconsistent  with  the  following  factors:  (i)  SBC  is  a  bank \nwith  moderate  creditworthiness,  and  several  banks,  including  those  participating  in  ADB\u2019s  Trade \nFinance  Facilitation  Program,  are  equally  or  more  creditworthy;12  (ii)  SME  lending  is  and  has  been  a \nprimary  focus  of  the  Government  of  the  Philippines,  and  new  regulatory  requirements  on  minimum \nlending  to  the  SME  sector;  and  (iii)  SBC  utilized  almost  all  its  approved  facility  limit  for  URC,  and  it \nrequested increases to the limit for URC distributors.  \n \nThe  proposed  equity  investment  in  the  CIB  was  cancelled  in  February  2011  because  (i)  the \n19. \nownership structure  deviated from that originally approved in the  report and recommendation of the \nPresident (RRP) and (ii) another board approval would have been necessary if the investment had been \npursued further. In 2008, the Credit Information Corporation (CIC) was established, but its ownership \nstructure  changed  from  that  originally  envisaged.  Instead  of  a  private  company,  CIC  was  set  up  as  a \ngovernment-owned and controlled corporation, with 60% of its shares owned by the public sector. At \napproval, the target date for the ADB investment was the end of 2005, as soon as legislation had been \npassed and investments finalized by all sponsors. It was envisaged that the CIB would be established as \na  corporate  entity  under  the  Corporation  Code,  with  Bangko  Sentral  ng  Pilipinas  owning  49%  of  the \ncompany and the balance by private sector institutions, related industry associations, strategic partners, \nand  ADB.  Guardianship  of  CIC  is  under  the  Philippines  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission  and  not \nBangko  Sentral  ng  Pilipinas,  as  originally  proposed.  Legislation  was  only  passed  in  2008,  and  the \nSecurities  and  Exchange  Commission  submitted  the  proposed  rules  and  guidelines  for  the \nestablishment  of  CIC  to  the  Congressional  Oversight  Committee  for  review  in  May  2009.  These  ruled \nand guidelines were approved in January 2010, and the board of CIC was set up in 2010 with the chair \nof  the  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission  as  its  head.  CIC  is  expected  be  fully  operational  by \nDecember  2014.  CIC  is  currently  receiving  advisory  services  financed  by  the  International  Finance \nCorporation to support the establishment of a credit information system in line with international best \npractice standards.   \n \n20. \nThe  initial  price,  which  was  evidently  included  in  the  facility  documents,  was  based  on  a \nsample price range. It was never actually applied to any transaction under the PCG facility, which was \ndetermined  on  a  case-by-case  basis.  Pricing  included  the  arrangement  for  compensating  the  PFI  for \nadministrative costs incurred implementing the facility. \n \nIn  February  2011,  nearly  3  years  after  the  first  transaction  with  SBC,  the  PSOD  cancelled  the \n21. \nunallocated  balance  of  P500  million.  The  proposed  $1  million  equity  investment  in  the  CIB  was  also \ncancelled in February 2011 because the corporation established by the government (CIC) deviated from \nthe structure originally approved in the RRP.  The last qualifying instrument under SBC\u2019s URC program \nexpired in February 2011, and there were no new enrollments afterwards. The Guarantee Facility Deed \nofficially  reached  its  end  of  availability  period  without  any  outstanding  qualifying  instrument  on  26 \nApril 2012, and the PCG facility was terminated on the same day. \n \n \n\n                                                      \n12  ADB. 2003.

However,  the  profitability \nof SBC and the impact that the PCG facility made \non  a  few  SMEs  are  positive  accomplishments. \nAlthough  five  or  six  banks  were  identified  as \npossible  partners,  SBC  was  the  only  one  that \nparticipated.  The  PCG  facility  for  SBC  was \napproved for P500 million, of which P100 million \nwas  allocated  to  URC  as  the  principal  for  its \ndistributors comprising locally incorporated SMEs \nwith  sales  turnover  not  exceeding  P1  billion  per \nyear.  The  first  transaction  under  the  facility  was \nbooked  in  January  2008,  and  utilization  peaked \nat  P98.8  million  in  February  2010.  The  last \ntransaction  matured  in  February  2011.  Only  16 \nSME  URC  wholesalers  received  credit  under  the \nfacility.  Some  65  DSLCs  amounting  to  P430 \nmillion  were  issued  by  SBC,  50%  of  which  were \nguaranteed  by  ADB.  SBC  never  used  the \nremaining  balance  of  P400  million  since  it  was \nunaware  that  the  facility  could  be  used  to \nguarantee other SME term lending, as well as the \nDSLCs  for  URC  distributors.  In  February  2011, \nADB  cancelled  the  unallocated  balance  of  the \nP500  million.  Because  of  its  small  size  and  the \nfact that there was only one PFI, the facility had \nlimited  impact  outside  and  inside  SBC.  The \nproposed $1 million equity investment in the CIB \nwas cancelled in February 2011 since the agency \ndeviated from the structure approved in the RRP. \nThe  project  had  very  little  impact  on  improving \nthe enabling environment for lending to SMEs.    \n\nThe  small  size  of  the  credit  guarantee  facility \nlimited  its  impact  on  competition.  However,  its \nconcept  of  providing  guarantees  to  SMEs  was \ngood,  and  more  competition  would  have  been \nencouraged  if  more  banks  had  participated  in \nthe  project.  Since  only  SBC  participated,  the \nrating is less than satisfactory.  \n\nAt inception of the project, the credit guarantee \nfacility  filled  a  gap  in  the  market  for  SME \nlending.  SBC  was  skeptical  of  URC  at  first,  and \nthe  project  may  have  helped \nthem  get \ncomfortable with URC.

At the start of the project, \nmost  were  small,  but  some  grew  substantially \nimplementation  period.  Others, \nduring \nhowever,  declined,  resulting  in  larger  but  more \nefficient  regional  distributors.  Since  the  project \nwas  limited  to  URC  distributors,  there  were  no \nmajor  external  upstream  or  downstream  effects, \nas SBC was the only participating bank.      \n\nthe \n\nThe  approach  was  supposed  to  be  a  model  for \nothers to follow. However, it was not adopted by \nany bank except SBC. Even within SBC there was \na  misunderstanding,  and  only  one  model\u2014that \nof  guaranteeing  DSLCs\u2014was  adopted.  The \nconcept was not really understood by SBC, which \nthought  the  facility  could  only  apply  to  credit \nlines and/or letters of credit, and not other SME \nloans.  These  misunderstandings \nlimited  the \nproject\u2019s  contribution  to  banking  services  to \nSMEs  in  the  local  financial  system.  Also,  the \napproach  of  guaranteeing  individual  SME  loans \nfell out of favor within ADB when changes within \nthe  PSOD  took  place,  which  might  have  also \nslowed  new  approvals  under  the  project.  ADB \nwas  more \nfinancial \nintermediary  risk  than  direct  SME  company  risk. \nThe catalytic element was therefore minimal.  \n\ncomfortable \n\ntaking \n\nin \n\nindustry \n\nfinancial \n\nbetween \n\ninvestment \n\ninstitutions \n\nThe  project  had  limited  effect  since  only  one \nbank  participated  and  the  project  investment \nthe \nwas  small.  The  equity \nproposed CIB never materialized.

Guardianship  of  CIC  is  under  the \nPhilippines  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission \nand  not  the  Bangko  Sentral  ng  Pilipinas  as \noriginally  proposed.

SBC \nnever  fully  understood  the  potential  of  the \nproject  and  limited  its  application  to  DSLCs  for \nURC  distributors.  ADB  also  became  uncertain  of \nthe  concept  due  to  personnel  changes.  Also, \nPSOD preferred to provide guarantees to a bank \nrather  than  assume  risks  with  actual  SMEs \nbecause  the  latter  would  have  overwhelmed \nADB\u2019s  available  back  office  resources.  SBC \nultimately became comfortable with URC and did \nnot require ADB to share risk. The project had no \ndirect  impact  on  SBC\u2019s  corporate  governance \nactivities.  \n\ninternational \n\nSBC staff acquired new skills and learned lessons \nabout  working  with \nlending \nagencies  as  a  result  of  the  new  concept. \nHowever,  SBC  never  fully  understood  the  full \npotential  of  the  project  and  thought  the \nguarantees  under  the  PCG  facility  could  only \napply  to  credit  lines  and/or  letters  of  credit  and \nnot to other SME term loans. \n\nThe  project  was  small  and  was  not  designed  to \nhave  a  major  impact.  Low  utilization  (only  10% \nof  the  facility  was  accessed)  further  limited  its \nimpact.  It  had  no  observable  impact  on  the \nbusiness  of  SBC.  SBC\u2019s  skills  upgrading  was \nlimited.
