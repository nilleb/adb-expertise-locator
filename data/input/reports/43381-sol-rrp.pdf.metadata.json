The \npre-construction activities are already at an advanced stage under \nthe ongoing Solomon Islands Road Improvement (Sector) Project \n(SIRIP).  The  permanent  secretary  for  MID  will  be  responsible  for \nproject \nimplementation.  A  project  management  unit  (PMU) \ncomprising  technical,  administrative,  and  accounting  staff  and \nheaded  by  a  professionally  qualified  civil  engineer  will  manage \nand  administer  the  project  under  the  guidance  of  the  project \nsteering committee established under SIRIP.  \n \n\n \nPeriod of Utilization \n  \nEstimated Project \nCompletion Date \n  \nExecuting Agency \n \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\n \n\n\f \n\niii\n\nfor  ADB \n\nProcurement  under  the  project  will  follow  ADB\u2019s  Procurement \nGuidelines  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  Expanded \nprocurement  eligibility \nto  administer  European \nCommission cofinancing will require Board approval. International \ncompetitive bidding (ICB) procurement will primarily apply to major \nstructural  works  (bridges,  river  training,  road  approaches  and \nprotection  works,  sealed  road).  Road  pavement  and  drainage \nimprovements  on  the  existing  carriageway  of  gravel  and  feeder \nroads  will  be  procured  through  national  competitive  bidding, \nshopping,  or  small-scale  private  sector  contracting  for  the  use  of \nLBES techniques with community participation. The evaluation of \nICB  contracts  will  include  a  margin  of  preference  for  national \ncontractors, as specified in ADB\u2019s procurement guidelines. \n \nThe  project  will  require  consulting  support\u201453 person-months  of \ninternational  and  158  person-months  of  national  consulting \nservices\u2014in  addition  to  the  assistance  in  feasibility  studies, \ndetailed  engineering  design,  project  management,  and \nimplementation  supervision  that  are  now  being  provided  to  the \nproject  management  and  capacity  building  unit  created  under \nSIRIP.  All  consulting  recruitment,  with  one  exception,  will  use \nADB\u2019s  quality- and  cost-based  selection  method  based  on \nsimplified  technical  proposals  and  conforms  to  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines \non the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). \nthe  HIV  education  and  awareness \nConsulting  support \ncampaign, however, will be recruited through ADB\u2019s single-source \nselection method. \n \nThe  benefits  of  the  project  will  accrue  from  (i) savings  in  travel \ntime, vehicle operating cost, and freight cost on existing modes of \ntravel, and a shift to lower-cost modes; (ii) a reduction in periodic \nroute severance by floods, and in the associated safety risks and \neconomic  and  social  disruption;  and  (iii) better  connectivity  in \npreviously hard-to-reach areas, stimulating agricultural production \nthrough  easier  access  to  markets,  and  improving  health  and \neducation through reliable access to schools and health facilities. \n\nfor \n\nThe  completion  of  the  remaining  subprojects  is  subject  to \ntechnical  risks  that  are  largely  within  the  control  of  MID.  These \nrisks  can  be  satisfactorily  mitigated \nthrough  sound  project \nmanagement  and  supervision.  The  main  financial  risks  lie  in  the \nuncertainty  of \nthe \nsubprojects.  That  matter  will  be  settled  by  the  time  the  financing \nfor  the  second-phase  project  is  approved,  as  tenders  have  been \nadvertised.

More than 80% of the population \nis rural, living in widely dispersed villages of a few hundred persons. Infrastructure and services, \nespecially in the rural areas, are inadequate. Improvements in the efficiency and effectiveness \nof  the  national  road  network  under  the  project  will  make  the  rural  areas  more  accessible  and \npromote development. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nThe  economy  is  based  on  primary  commodities  from  agriculture,  forestry,  and  fishing. \n3. \nJobs are limited: only about a quarter of the population is formally employed. Income-generating \nopportunities in the rural areas are scarce. Infrastructure investments are needed for economic \ngrowth, employment, poverty reduction, and social development. \n \n4. \nThe  road  network  reaches  only  about  a  quarter  of  the  rural  villages.  About  60%  of  the \nnetwork  is  on  Guadalcanal  and  Malaita,  which  serve  about  90%  of  the  traffic  in  the  country. \nSealed  or  graveled  roads  are  confined  to  Guadalcanal  and  Malaita,  which  also  have  the  only \nsignificant inland roads, and a segment of secondary road in the Western Province. The other \nsix provinces have relatively short coastal segments of gravel or earth roads near the provincial \ncenters. Widespread deferment of maintenance has left provincial and secondary roads in the \nrural provinces so badly deteriorated that they can no longer be maintained and urgently need \nrehabilitation.  At  the  Government\u2019s  request,  the  Solomon  Islands  Road  Improvement  (Sector) \nProject  (SIRIP)  was  prepared  and  is  now  being  implemented  with  a  preferential  focus  on \naddressing  the  urgent  need  in  the  underserved  parts  of  the  country.  2  A  chronology  of  events \nunder SIRIP is in Appendix 2 and an analysis of the road subsector is in Appendix 3.   \n \n5. \nThe proposed project will implement the Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB\u2019s) strategy for \nSolomon  Islands  by  (i) upgrading  and  preserving  transport  infrastructure,  (ii) facilitating  the \nexpansion  of  transport  services,  (iii) strengthening  the  enabling  environment  for  private  sector \ndevelopment,  and  (iv) providing  opportunities  for  the  private  sector  and  local  communities  to \nparticipate  directly  in  the  project  activities.  Further,  the  project  will  guide  future  external \nassistance  in  the  road  subsector  through  better  aid  coordination  and  consistent  development \nplanning, while serving as a basis for the Government\u2019s investments in the subsector. \n\n                                                 \n1   Through the Memorandum of Understanding on Channel Financing (Technical Assistance Program) between the \n\nGovernment of the Commonwealth of Australia and the Asian Development Bank (ADB). \n\n2   ADB.  2006.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors  on  a  Proposed  Asian \nDevelopment  Fund  Grant  to  the  Solomon  Islands  for  the  Road  Improvement  (Sector)  Project.  Manila  (Grants \n0048/0049/0050-SOL,  approved  on  8  August,  cofinanced  by  ADB  [$0.35  million],  the  Government  of  Australia \n[$6.10 million], and the Government of New Zealand [$9.75 million]). \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\n1. \n\nThe Government\u2019s Sector Strategy \n\n6. \nThe  Government\u2019s  development  vision,  priorities,  and  strategies  are  expressed  in  the \nMedium-Term  Development  Strategy  (MTDS)  2008\u20132010. 3   There  are  six  priorities:  (i) \nreconciliation  and  rehabilitation,  (ii)  national  security  and  foreign  relations,  (iii)  infrastructure \ndevelopment, (iv) social services, (v) the economic and productive sectors, and (vi) civic affairs. \nInfrastructure  development  and  private  sector\u2013led  growth  also  have  high  priority.  The \nGovernment  has  announced  its  intention  to  align  budget  formulation  and  implementation  with \nthese  priorities,  especially  in  the  delivery  of  essential  services  and  policy  reform.  The \nsecond-largest  slice  of  program  funds  under  MTDS  2008\u20132010,  after  the  economic  and \nproductive sectors, goes to infrastructure programs. The transport policies in MTDS 2008\u20132010 \nemphasize  the  need  to  rehabilitate  and  maintain  infrastructure  to  reverse  past  neglect  and \nprovide better market access and service delivery, for rural development.  \n \n7. \nWith ADB assistance, the Government has prepared its National Transport Plan (NTP) \nand  created  the  transport  policy  and  planning  unit  (TPPU)  under  the  Ministry  of  Infrastructure \nDevelopment  (MID).4  The  NTP  provides  the  strategic  framework  and  a  3-year  action  plan  for \ndeveloping and maintaining physical infrastructure, facilitating transport services, improving the \ncapacity  of government  agencies, and  increasing  private  sector  participation.  It  is centered  on \n(i) rehabilitating high-priority roads and bridges on Guadalcanal and Malaita; (ii) extending such \nrehabilitation  to  other  provinces;  (iii) strengthening  the  capacity  to  manage  projects,  contracts, \nand road assets; and (iv) promoting the participation of the private sector, communities, women, \nand youth groups in road maintenance. \n \nTo  implement  the  NTP,  Parliament  passed  the  National  Transport  Fund  (NTF)  Act \n8. \ncreating the NTF in 2008. Government funds for transport infrastructure improvement are now \nchanneled through the NTF and managed by TPPU, but regulations for the full operation of the \nNTF  under  a  board  of  directors  are  being  prepared.  The  Government\u2019s  transport  task  force, \ncomprising representatives from key government agencies, advises MID and the TPPU on key \nissues, development options, and priorities. The Government has also embarked on institutional \nreforms, with ADB assistance, to reinforce its capacity to implement a sector project effectively. \nThe  comprehensive  implementation  assistance  and  capacity  building  under  SIRIP  has  also \nresulted in greater community involvement, sector plans that are more responsive to community \nneeds,  and  rural  economic  development  through  increased  productivity  and  opportunities  for \noccasional labor. \n\n2. \n\nADB\u2019s Interim Country Partnership Strategy \n\nADB\u2019s  interim  country  partnership  strategy  2009\u201320115  for  Solomon  Islands  seeks  to \n9. \npromote equitable private sector\u2013led economic growth by improving transportation infrastructure \nand  services  and  strengthening  the  enabling  environment  for  business,  and  thereby  reduce \npoverty.  Capacity  development  and  good  governance  are  guiding  priorities  in  this  regard,  and \nthe fullest use will be made of links between these priority areas. \n \n10. \nADB  is  implementing  SIRIP  (footnote  2)  to  improve  the  efficiency  and  effectiveness  of \nthe national network of provincial and secondary roads by (i) rehabilitating about 100 kilometers \n\n                                                 \n3  Government of Solomon Islands. 2008.

Physical  works,  which  began  in  March  2007  and  are  about  42% \ncomplete,  are  scheduled  for  completion  in  December  2011.  SIRIP  is  cofinanced  by  the \ngovernments  of  Australia  and  New  Zealand,  with  ADB  administering  all  the  cofinancing.  A \ndetailed description of SIRIP\u2019s status is in Appendix 4.  \n \n11. \nUnder SIRIP, ADB has also helped MID to move away from the direct implementation of \nworks  and  toward  a  greater  emphasis  on  sector  planning  and  governance.  The  project \nmanagement and capacity building unit formed under SIRIP is developing capacity within MID \nand TPPU to concentrate on policy development, planning and programming, regulation, asset \nmanagement, administration, supervision, and quality assurance, and to promote private sector \nparticipation.  ADB  continues  to  provide  technical  assistance  (TA)  to  support  the  transition, \nupdate the NTP, and establish an asset management system.7  \n \n12. \nIn  recognition  of  ADB\u2019s  long  experience  in  implementing  projects  and  TA  in  the  road \nsubsector of Solomon Islands, as well as its expertise in designing and monitoring safeguards, \nthe Government has requested ADB to take the lead in coordinating aid in the road subsector, \nand  other  partners  have  agreed.  ADB\u2019s  country  program  in  transportation  complements \nassistance  under  way  or  being  considered  by  other  development  partners\u2014including  project \npreparatory  TA  in  2009  for  potential  investment  in  transport  infrastructure  development  in \n2010\u2014by  creating  a  transportation  system  that  will  link  rural  areas  to  markets  and  social \nservices in urban centers. The NTP and the institutional reforms within MID are key factors in \ncoordination. \n\nB. \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities  \n\n13. \nAs a fragile country emerging from several years of conflict and, more recently, natural \ndisasters,  Solomon  Islands  is  confronting  many  challenges  and  opportunities.  The  most \npressing needs are (i) sustained economic growth, (ii) more employment and income-generating \nopportunities,  (iii)  a  stronger  institutional  framework  for  managing  and  administering  public \nsector  responsibilities,  and  (iv)  improved  human  and  institutional  capacity.  Progress  in  these \nareas is expected to contribute directly to reducing poverty.  \n\n1. \n\nProblems and Constraints \n\nEmployment  and  Income  Generation.  Falling  commodity  prices,  deteriorating  rural \n14. \ninfrastructure,  lack  of  rural  services  and  access  to  markets,  and  low-productivity  traditional \ncultivation  practices  hamper  rural  agricultural  development.  Poor  and  expensive  infrastructure \nfacilities and services, a weak legal and institutional business environment, inadequate business \nand banking services, and a limited market constrain the development of the private sector and \nemployment growth. \n \n                                                 \n6   The  LBES  technique  uses  labor  and  equipment  (usually  medium  or  intermediate sized)  for  the  cost-effective \n\nprovision or maintenance of infrastructure to a specified standard. \n\n7   ADB.  2007.  Technical  Assistance  to  Solomon  Islands  for  Preparing  the  Domestic  Maritime  Support  Project  and \n\nTechnical Support Program. Manila (TA 4980-SOL). \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\nSector  Investments,  Operations,  and  Sustainability.  Road  sustainability  is  a  major \n15. \nchallenge. Financial constraints, poor equipment maintenance, and geographic conditions have \ncontributed  to  poor  road  maintenance  for  many  years.  As  a  result,  many  roads  need \nrehabilitation  so  that  they  can  be  maintained  once  again  and  support  traffic.  However,  the \ngovernment  budget  provides  only  for  maintenance  and  not  for  new  investments,  and  the  high \ndebt burden rules out further borrowing. Therefore, projects must be prioritized and sequenced \nto  maximize  the  benefits.  Past  efforts,  directed  mostly  at  basic  maintenance  and  emergency \nworks,  were  inadequate  and  costly.  A  shift  to  sustainable  rehabilitation  and  preventive  asset \nmanagement is needed to keep the network fit for use.  \n \n16. \nRoad  Network  Development.  Because  of  poor  asset  management,  about  70%  of  the \nroad  network  can  no  longer  be  maintained,  and  requires  reconstruction  or  rehabilitation.  The \nGovernment has invested about $11 million from domestic sources and $96 million in external \nfunding  in  the  road  subsector  over  the  past  2  decades  (Appendix  5).  Improvements  on  about \n140 km  of  national  roads  under  ongoing  projects  will  guarantee  all-weather  access. 8   The \nrehabilitation of about 200 km is being carried out under the Community Sector Program of the \nAustralian Agency for International Development (AusAID). These interventions have achieved \nall-weather  access on  almost  all  national  roads.  However,  on  provincial and  secondary  roads, \nbridges  must  be  repaired  or  replaced,  pavement  reshaped  and  strengthened,  and  drainage \nimproved.  Village  and  farm  roads  also  need  improvement  to  allow  poor  rural  communities  to \nshare in the benefits.  \n \n17. \nRoad  Maintenance  Funds  and  Budgeting.  Roads  are  being  maintained  as  they  are \ngradually being rehabilitated. Road maintenance funding has increased by an average of 20% \nyearly since the start of SIRIP. The maintenance funds have increased but are still not enough. \nRoad inventories and condition surveys are being undertaken as part of the NTP update. The \nresults  will  feed  into  the  road  asset  management  system,  which  will  generate  annual \nmaintenance funds for the network. Maintaining the rehabilitated lengths of road to all-weather \naccess conditions will continue to require investment support. \n \n18. \nLessons.  Historically,  most  projects  in  the  road  subsector  have  used  force-account \nprocedures, and only a few have been done under contract. Projects lacked quality at entry and \nwere  built  to  poor  standards,  and  were  therefore  unsustainable.  Key  institutional  and  policy \nissues  were  not  resolved;  these  included  (i) inaction  on  the  overloading  of  logging  trucks, \n(ii) shortfall  in  maintenance  funding  in  favor  of  capital  expenditure,  (iii) failure  to  institutionalize \nan  effective  asset  management  system,  and  (iv) limited  national  contracting  capacity  for  road \nmaintenance  and  rehabilitation.  SIRIP  has  made  significant  advances  in  (i) addressing  the \nfunding  issue  through  the  legal  establishment  of  the  NTF,  (ii) setting  up  asset  management \nsystems within MID, and (iii) encouraging the formation of small and medium-sized enterprises \nto  undertake  road  maintenance  with  LBES  techniques  under  simple  contract  procedures.  The \nnew  LBES  techniques  have  proven  successful  but  require  close  attention  to  training, \nsupervision,  and  performance  standards,  as  well  as commitment  to  routine  maintenance  once \nthe roads have been rehabilitated. \n\n                                                 \n8   ADB.  2006.

Manila  (Grant  0078-SOL). \nSee also footnote 2. \n\n\f2. \n\nOpportunities \n\nAlthough \n\nthe  road \n\ntransport  subsector  can  contribute  significantly \n\n19. \nto  national \ndevelopment,  it  has  underperformed  because  of  neglect  and  poor  implementation.  Recent \nproject  interventions,  including  SIRIP,  have  improved  sector  performance  through  integrated \nand  sustained  attention  to  asset  management,  institutional  reform,  project  planning  and \nselection,  outsourcing,  and  increased  institutional  capacity;  these  improvements,  in  turn,  have \ncreated  clear  opportunities  for  road  infrastructure  investment  to  produce  more-significant \neconomic and social benefits to the country.  \n \n20. \nLabor-Based,  Equipment-Supported  Maintenance  Techniques.  SIRIP  has \nintroduced  LBES  techniques  in  small-scale  maintenance  contracts  to  develop  the  capacity  of \nthe  country\u2019s  small  to  medium-sized  contractors.  LBES  methods  of  rehabilitating  and \nmaintaining roads and bridges are widely supported and contribute to community engagement, \nrural employment, and private sector development as cost-effective means of maintaining rural \nroads.  The  techniques  are  being  implemented  in  other  externally  assisted  projects  and  MID\u2019s \nown recurrent maintenance programs. The proposed project presents opportunities to adopt the \nLBES maintenance program and build on this record of success.  \n \n21. \nInfrastructure  Improvements  for  Economic  Development  and  Rural  Employment. \nAn  improved  and  sustainable  rural  road  network  can  significantly  boost  rural  economic \ndevelopment. As access improves and transport costs go down, rural incomes will increase and \nso  will  production  and  employment.  Rehabilitating  provincial  and  secondary  roads  can  aid \nconnectivity  and  lower  the  costs  of  access  to  markets,  towns,  and  social  facilities.  Road \nmaintenance  contracts where  LBES  techniques  are  used have  generated  income  for  the  rural \npopulation. Rural incomes could improve further with the opportunities to expand these activities \nunder the proposed project. \n \nCommunity and Gender Participation. SIRIP has succeeded in involving communities \n22. \nin  road  rehabilitation  and  maintenance.  As  the  road  network  expands,  the  LBES  approach  is \ngaining more interest and acceptability in the local communities. Women have more opportunity \nto participate actively, in road maintenance contracts that follow this approach. They are twice \nas  likely  to  be  employed  as  men,  because  contractors  are  required  to  encourage  women  to \nparticipate  in  road  maintenance.  Moreover,  because  LBES  techniques  do  not  use  heavy \nmachinery,  they  are  better  suited  to  women.  Through  community  consultation,  expressions  of \ninterest  are  received  from  potential  female  contractors  among  individual  women  and  women\u2019s \ngroups.  These  female  contractors  are  identified  and  trained  under  the  capacity  development \ncomponent  of  SIRIP.  The  project  offers  opportunities  to  build  and  expand  community  and \ngender participation. \n\n3. \n\nRationale for the Project \n\n23. \nPro-poor  economic  growth  and  improvement  in  social  and  health  indicators  call  for  a \nrevitalized and decentralized rural economy. Poor roads constrain the movement of people and \ngoods  and  discourage  productive  rural  activity.  Transport  infrastructure  and  services  must \nimprove to provide reliable access to domestic and international markets for rural produce and \ncommodities,  and  thereby  (i)  restart  and  build  rural  economies,  (ii)  reduce  the  migration  of \npeople  in  search  of  employment,  (iii)  decrease  conflict  between  groups  competing  for  limited \nopportunities,  and  (iv)  restore  basic  social  services  in  rural  areas.  Improved  rural  accessibility \nwill help reduce poverty. \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\n \n24.  Most  previous  projects,  representing  more  than  90%  of  investment  in  the  road \nsubsector,  have  been  concentrated  in  Guadalcanal  and  Malaita.  The  other  seven  provinces \nhave received less attention. 9 The Government has requested that the road connectivity needs \nof  these  seven  provinces  be  given  preferential  focus  in  the  preparation  of  the  project,  with \nsubprojects selected on the basis of the NTP priorities, as well as the urgency of restoring the \nroad links damaged by floods in February 2009. The project will deliver external assistance for \ninfrastructure  development  to  restore  or  provide  connectivity  that  requires  the  technical  and \nfinancial  capacity  of  larger  international  and  national  construction  firms,  in  particular  the \nreplacement of bridges, other water crossings, and approach roads, and the realignment of new \nroads  for  climate  change  adaptation.  Existing  gravel  roads  can  then  undergo  restorative \nmaintenance under small-scale LBES maintenance contracts, using systems established under \nSIRIP.  \n \n25. \nThe project will (i) expand the scope of rehabilitation beyond Guadalcanal and Malaita, \n(ii) make  permanent  repairs  in  the  water  crossings  on  Guadalcanal  West  Road  that  were \ndamaged  by  the  50-year  flood  of  February  2009, 10   and  (iii)  provide  for  climate  change \nadaptation.  The  feasibility  studies  and  detail  engineering  designs  for  two  subprojects  are  in \nadvance  stages  of  completion.  The  Makira  subproject,  the  bigger  subproject  with  72.5  km  of \nroads and 25 water crossings, is at the contract award stage, while the Guadalcanal subproject \nis  at  the  detailed  engineering  design  stage.  A  third  subproject,  this  one  in  Malaita,  is  being \nidentified for inclusion under the project. Other subprojects will also be included, depending on \nthe  availability  of  funds.  The  project  will  be  implemented  as  a  sector  project  and  will  finance \nthree  subprojects.  The  above  proposal  is  consistent  with  the  original  objectives  of  SIRIP  and \nsupports the Government\u2019s desire for ADB to take the lead in the road subsector and establish a \nprocess  of  coordinating  aid  to  the  subsector  and  making  such  aid  more  predictable.  The \nsubprojects will be selected from the NTP list of priority roads. \n \nAdvances  in  building  the  capacity  of  MID  for  road  planning,  road  asset  management, \n26. \ncontract  management,  and  construction  supervision  through  the  project  management  and \ncapacity  building  unit  established  under  SIRIP  must  be  formalized  for  long-term  sustainability. \nThe NTF should be made the operative funding mechanism for road maintenance and funding \napplication, disbursement,  and  oversight,  so  that  the  roads  subsector becomes  less  reliant  on \nexternal  financial  assistance  over  the  medium  term,  as  part  of  the  implementation  of  the \ntransport sector strategy and NTP. A sector-wide approach to external development assistance \nbased  on  domestic  processes  will  promote  effective  planning  and  implementation  of  works  in \nthe long term. \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n27. \nThe project will remove transport accessibility constraints on economic growth and social \ndevelopment in the subproject areas by restoring or providing road connectivity and improving \nreliability of access in the face of natural hazards. The impact will be economic growth, social \ndevelopment, and reduction of hardship and poverty in the areas served by the subprojects.  \n \n\n                                                 \n9  The seven other provinces are Central, Choiseul, Isabel, Makira, Renbel, Temotu, and Western. \n10 A  50-year  flood  is  a  destructive  flood  of  a  magnitude  that  occurs  once  in  50  years  or  has  a  2%  probability  of \n\noccurring in any given year. \n\n\fThe  outcome  will  be  improved  road  transport  that  supports  economic  and  social \n28. \nactivities  by  (i) restoring  or  providing  road  connectivity  between  rural  areas  and  the  main \nregional  centers;  (ii) reducing  susceptibility  to  closures  from  natural  hazards;  (iii) reducing \ntransport  costs,  and  making  the  transport  of  people  and  goods  more  reliable  and  safe; \n(iv) encouraging  increased  cultivation  of  land  with  agricultural  potential,  and  the  marketing  of \ncash crops for national and international trade; (v) providing opportunities for people to travel for \nemployment;  (vi) providing  access  to  health,  education,  and  other  social  and  community \nservices and so improving the health and education of the affected population; and (vii) reducing \ntravel fatalities and injuries, particularly among young people, women, and the elderly. \n\nB. \n\nOutputs  \n\nRoad Rehabilitation. The project will finance (i) selected road and bridge rehabilitation \n29. \nworks in the seven provinces not covered by SIRIP, according to the priorities set in the NTP; \n(ii) the permanent repair of roads damaged in the February 2009 flood event and the upgrading \nof the waterway crossing; and (iii) road relocation for climate change adaptation. There will be \ntwo core subprojects: the Kirakira\u2013Wainuri road in Makira Province and the West Guadalcanal \nRoad  between  Poha  Stream  and  Naro  Hill  (flood  restoration  and  upgrading).  The  work  will \ninvolve replacing or upgrading about 30  water crossings (bridges, culverts, and wet crossings), \nbuilding about 20 km of associated bridge approaches, and relocating roads for climate change \nadaptation.  Of  the  20  km  of  associated  bridge  approaches,  about  10  km  will  be  sealed  to \nprevent the loss of pavement materials during heavy rain and floods. Each subproject from the \nNTP  will  be  prioritized  and  selected  according  to  the  process  and  eligibility  criteria  in \nAppendix 6. \n \n30. \nA  systematic  and  consultative  approach  will  be  established  for  subproject  appraisal, \ncovering  (i)  social,  economic,  and  environmental  evaluation;  (ii)  design;  (iii)  procurement; \n(iv) implementation;  and  (v)  monitoring.  Each  subproject  feasibility  study  will  provide  sufficient \nevidence of eligibility under the agreed criteria, and will have the required detail and quality to \nenable ADB to assess the viability  and suitability of the subproject. No subproject categorized \nas  category  A,  according  to  ADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy  (2003)  or  ADB\u2019s  Involuntary \nResettlement Policy (1995), will be financed under the project. Implementation will incorporate \nHIV awareness and prevention, as well as general health and safety, activities, as appropriate. \nClimate change adaptation measures will be incorporated into the subproject designs. \n \nRoad  Maintenance.  This  will  comprise  the  annual  maintenance  of  road  sections \n31. \nconstructed under SIRIP, past and ongoing investment projects, and the project, through private \nsector  LBES  techniques  developed  under  SIRIP  and  routine  maintenance  involving  local \ncommunities.  \n \n32. \nProject  Management  and  Capacity  Development.  The  project  will  provide  project \nmanagement and capacity development through a project management unit (PMU), which will \nplan, assess, design, manage, and implement the road, drainage, and bridge works under road \nrehabilitation and maintenance. \n\nC. \n\nSpecial Features  \n\nContinuity  and  Consolidation  with  SIRIP.  SIRIP  for  the  most  part  is  being  smoothly \n33. \nimplemented  by  MID,  the  executing  agency.  Capacity  development,  community  participation, \nand private sector development have increased. A second phase would provide opportunities to \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\fin  Solomon \n\nCofinancing  and  Donor  Harmonization.  ADB\u2019s  strategy \n\nconsolidate  progress  and  ensure  that  the  improvements  in  procedures  and  capacity  become \npermanent features of MID\u2019s business processes. In addition, the project will allow the MID and \nthe  small-  and  medium-scale  private  sector  contractors  developed  under  SIRIP  to  strengthen \nand expand their capacity. The ongoing support for road maintenance will secure the continued \nmaintenance of the roads rehabilitated under SIRIP. \n \n34. \nIslands \nemphasizes  coordination  with  development  partners  and  encourages  cofinancing,  a  feature  of \nall  projects  approved  by  ADB  since  2000.  For  the  project,  the  Government  of  Australia  has \nagreed to provide cofinancing of $4.50 million from the Pacific Region Infrastructure Facility, for \nthe restoration of permanent works for the Guadalcanal subproject. The European Commission \nhas  committed  to  provide  cofinancing  of  \u20ac2.475  million  ($3.34  million  equivalent)  for  the  road \nrehabilitation component on Guadalcanal and Malaita. \n \n35. \nCommunity  Participation  and  Labor-Intensive  Employment.  The  project  will \ngenerate  employment  opportunities  and  increase  the  number  of  national  contractors  through \ncommunity LBES contracts to rehabilitate and maintain rural roads. Under these arrangements, \nnational  and  community  contractors  are  being  trained  in  ongoing  projects  to  undertake  road \nrehabilitation and maintenance contracts. Women workers are participating in greater numbers, \nand  women  contractors  are  gaining  more  capacity  through  on-the-job  training.  This  model  will \ncontinue  in  the  proposed  project,  which  will  feature  rigorously  expanded  LBES  techniques  in \nroad maintenance contracts. \n \n36. \nClimate  Change  Adaptation.  The  project  will  have  these  climate  change  adaptation \nfeatures: (i) watercourse crossings designed to accept higher floods and river debris loads; (ii) \nbridge  abutments  anchored  to  piled  foundations  to  minimize  the  collapse  of  abutments  and \napproach  roads;  (iii)  river  training  works  to  minimize  the  deviation  of  watercourses  from  their \noriginal path; (iv) strengthened protection to approach roads with additional protection and river \ntraining  works;  (v)  where  a  raised  water  table  makes  the  road  more  flood  prone,  side  slopes \ndesigned to prevent erosion through gradient and protection, and a raised road surface; and (vi) \nrerouting of coastal sections of road exposed to wave action and king-tide inundation away from \nthe  immediate  foreshore.  Supplementary  Appendix  D  describes  the  project\u2019s  climate  change \nadaptation strategies. \n \n37. \nNongovernment Organizations in HIV Education. SIRIP has pioneered new methods \nof  raising  awareness  of  HIV  and  educating  rural  communities  about  its  dangers.  Contractors \nprovide HIV education and make condoms accessible to all their employees. Save the Children \nAustralia, in conjunction with a local nongovernment organization (NGO), will be contracted to \nprovide community awareness programs. Awareness materials are reinforced during community \nmaintenance  work,  and  MID  actively  monitor  compliance  with  contract  requirements.  These \narrangements would continue under the project. \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\fD. \n\nProject Investment Plan  \n\nThe project is estimated to require an investment of $24.0 million, excluding taxes and \n\n38. \nduties, as shown in Table 1.

The Government of Australia, through the \nPacific Region Infrastructure Facility, will provide grant cofinancing equivalent to $4.50 million, \nto  be  administered  by  ADB. 11   The  European  Commission  will  provide  grant  cofinancing \nequivalent  to  $3.34  million,  also  to  be  administered  by  ADB.12    The  Government  of  Solomon \nIslands will provide $1.16 million. Withdrawals from the grant account will be based on 100% of \neligible expenditures for each claim received, up to the total amount to be financed by the grant, \nexclusive of taxes and duties.

The current project steering committee \n40. \nwill  guide  and  monitor  all  aspects  of  project  implementation,  including  (i) policy  guidance  and \ncoordination, (ii) subproject feasibility study and selection, (iii) project progress reports and other \nproject  documentation,  (iv) annual  reports  on  road  maintenance  budgets  and  activities,  and \n(v) audited accounts and financial statements.13 A PMU will be established in MID to coordinate \nand  implement  the  project.  The  permanent  secretary  of  MID  will  be  responsible  for  overall \nproject  management.  The  permanent  secretary  will  assign  a  project  coordinator  to  provide \nliaison with the PMU in the implementation of the project.14 Given MID\u2019s limited technical staff \nresources, a consulting firm will be hired for these services (paras. 31 and 33). A professionally \nqualified civil engineer with appropriate road project management experience will be responsible \nfor project management and day-to-day implementation of project activities, with the support of \ntechnical, accounting and finance, and administrative staff.  \n \n41. \nThe PMU will (i) conduct subproject feasibility documentation, design, and supervision; \n(ii) manage the bidding; (iii) manage contracts; (iv) prepare withdrawal applications; (v) prepare \nproject  progress  reports  and  a  project  completion  report;  (vi)  maintain  project  accounts  and \ncomplete  grant  financial  records  for  auditing;  (vii)  monitor  the  project\u2019s  socioeconomic  impact; \n(viii) train MID staff and build their project implementation capacity; and (ix) complete the related \nproject  management  activities  as  necessary  to  implement  the  project successfully  and  comply \nwith ADB policies and guidelines. \n  \n\n                                                 \n13  The  first  project  steering  committee  was  established  under  the  Post-Conflict  Emergency  Rehabilitation  Project. \nADB.  2000.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors  on  a  Proposed  Loan  to \nSolomon Islands for the Post-Conflict Emergency Rehabilitation Project. Manila (Loan 1823-SOL). The committee \nhas  continued  with  the  addition  of  a  few  members  as  appropriate  for  the  Road  Improvement  (Sector)  Project \n(footnote 2), the Emergency Assistance Project (footnote 8), and the Domestic Maritime Support (Sector) Project. \nADB.  2008.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors  on  a  Proposed  Asian \nDevelopment  Fund  Grant  and  Administration  of  Grant  to  Solomon  Islands  for  the  Domestic  Maritime  (Sector) \nProject. Manila. \n\n14  This arrangement is in place under three ongoing ADB-administered grants and is working satisfactorily.  \n\n\f2. \n\nImplementation Period \n\n42. \nThe project will be implemented over 2.5 years. The recruitment of the PMU consultants \nhas  begun  under  advance  action  and  will  be  completed  by  the  end  of  October  2009.  Other \npreparatory  activities  for  the  initial  works\u2014including  feasibility  studies,  detailed  design,  tender \ndocumentation,  award  of  contract,  and  mobilization\u2014will  be  completed  by  December  2009. \nRehabilitation activities will begin soon after mobilization in October 2009, and will be physically \ncompleted by the end of September 2011. The grant is scheduled to close by the end of March \n2012. This time frame takes into account the wet season and appropriate construction periods \nfor  remote  locations.  Capacity  development  and  the  community  awareness  program  will  be \nundertaken  over  the  entire  project  period  (2009\u20132011).  The  implementation  schedule  for  the \nproject is in Appendix 8. \n\n3. \n\nProcurement \n\n43. \nThe  procurement  of  all  packages  under  the  project  will  follow  ADB\u2019s  Procurement \nGuidelines (2007, as amended from time to time) and the Government\u2019s procurement systems \nwhere  appropriate.  The  procurement  systems  of  the  Government,  such  as  the  ministerial  and \ncentral tender boards, will be strengthened, particularly in strict compliance with bid documents. \nHence, for example, tender board meetings for the bid opening must be convened on the date \nand  time  specified  in  the  bid  documents,  provisions  regarding  the  acceptance  and  opening  of \nlate bids must be followed, and all tender board members or their representatives must be in the \ncountry for the bid opening.15 ADB\u2019s prior approval will be required for contract awards above \nthe  threshold  amounts  indicated  below  and  in  the  procurement  plan.  Two  major  contract \npackages  for  the  Makira  and  Guadalcanal  subprojects  will  be  procured  through  international \ncompetitive  bidding  (ICB).  ICB  activities  will  primarily  apply  to  major  structural  works  (bridges, \nriver  training,  road  approaches  and  protection  works,  sealed  road).  Road  pavement  and \ndrainage  improvements  on  existing  gravel  roads  will  be  procured  through  national  competitive \nbidding,  through  shopping,  or,  for  small-scale  contracts,  through  community  participation  in \nprocurement. ICB procedures will be used for civil works contracts of more than $1,000,000 and \ncontracts for goods valued at more than $500,000. National competitive bidding will be used for \ncivil works contracts of more than $100,000 and up to $1,000,000, and for contracts for goods \nvalued  at  more  than  $100,000  and  up  to  $500,000.  Shopping  procedures  or  community \nparticipation  will  apply  to  contracts  up  to  $100,000.  The  evaluation  of  the  ICB  contract  will \ninclude a margin of preference for national contractors. The procurement plan is in Appendix 9. \n\n4. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n44. \nA total of 53 person-months of international consulting services and 158 person-months \nof national consulting services will be required for the project. The services will cover (i) project \nmanagement;  (ii) institutional  strengthening  and  capacity  development;  and  (iii)  feasibility \nstudies,  detailed  engineering  design,  and  implementation  supervision.  A  separate  contract  for \nconsulting  services  for  about  18  person-months  will  be  required  for  the  HIV  education  and \nawareness campaign. \n \n45. \nAll consultants for the project will be recruited according to ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use \nof Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time), through quality- and cost-based selection \n(at  a  quality\u2013cost  ratio  of  80:20)  based  on  simplified  technical  proposals,  except  for  the \n                                                 \n15  Experience has shown that bids are not always opened on the specified dates and times; late bids are accepted, \nopened, publicly read out, and considered for bid evaluation; and bid opening dates have to be postponed at times \nbecause the members of tender boards are out of the country. \n\n11 \n\n \n\n\f12 \n\n \n\nconsultants  for  the  HIV  education  and  awareness  program,  who  will  be  hired  through  single-\nsource selection.16 At the request of the Government, ADB will select the consultants on behalf \nof  MID,  which  will  then  hire  the  selected  consultants.  Outline  terms  of  reference  for  the \nconsulting services are in Appendix 10. \n\n5. \n\nAdvance Action \n\n46. \nThe physical works will start in January 2010. The presence of the resident engineer on \nsite will be critical. Some of the detailed engineering designs for the Guadalcanal subproject will \nnot be completed under the TA (footnote 4) and will have to be completed in time for the calling \nof bids in January 2010. In addition, the feasibility assessments for the Malaita subproject need \nto  begin  in  January  2010.  To  avoid  delays  in  implementation,  the  Government  has  requested \nadvance action for the recruitment of the consultants. The Government has been advised that \nthe  approval  of  advance  action,  if  granted,  does  not  commit  ADB  to  provide  funds  for  the \nproject.  \n\n6. \n\nAnticorruption Policy \n\n47. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  Government  and  MID.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance, \naccountability,  and  transparency,  ADB  reserves  the  right  to  investigate,  directly  or  through  its \nagents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the project. To \nsupport  these  efforts,  relevant  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  are  included  in  the \ngrant regulations and the bidding documents for the project. In particular, all contracts financed \nby  ADB  in  connection  with  the  project  shall  include  provisions  specifying  the  right  of  ADB  to \naudit and examine the records and accounts of MID and all contractors, suppliers, consultants, \nand other service providers as they relate to the project. \n \nTo ensure transparency and good governance, MID will publicly disclose the use of the \n48. \ngrant proceeds on the Government\u2019s website. For each procurement contract, MID will disclose \n(i)  the  list  of  participating  bidders,  (ii)  the  name  of  the  winning  bidder,  (iii)  basic  details  on  the \nbidding  procedure  adopted,  (iv)  the  amount  of  the  contract  award,  (v)  the  list  of  goods  or \nservices purchased, and (vi) the intended and the actual amount of grant proceeds under each \ncontract. MID will see to it that all of its consultants, contractors, and staff are fully aware of and \ncomply  with  the  procedures  of  the  Government  and  ADB,  including  those  for  implementation, \nprocurement,  use  of  consultants,  disbursements,  reporting,  and  prevention  of  fraud  and \ncorruption. \n\n7. \n\nGrievance and Redress Mechanism \n\nA  procedure  for  managing  complaints  and  problems  will  be  established  by  MID  to \n49. \n(i) review and redress grievances of project stakeholders in relation to the project, any service \nprovider, or any person responsible for carrying out the project; and (ii) set the threshold criteria \nand procedures for handling such grievances, for proactively addressing them, and for notifying \nstakeholders about the mechanism or course of action chosen. \n\n                                                 \n16  Under SIRIP, Save the Children Australia hired the local nongovernment organization Nexus through single-source \nselection  method  to  provide  consulting  services  for  HIV,  with  the  approval  of  ADB\u2019s  Central  Operations  Services \nOffice. \n\n\f8. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n50. \nThe grant proceeds will be disbursed through direct payment, according to ADB\u2019s Loan \nDisbursement  Handbook  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  For  small,  community-based \ncontracts,  20%\u201325%  of  the  contract  value  will  be  paid  up  front  to  contractors  with  limited \nfinancial  capacity  to  ensure  that  they  have  sufficient  working  capital  to  pay  their  workers.  The \nadvance will be progressively deducted from their direct-payment claims.  \n\n9. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n51.  MID  will  make  satisfactory  arrangements  for  the  reporting  of  progress  in  project \nimplementation.  With  the  assistance  of  the  PMU,  MID  will  submit  to  ADB  quarterly  progress \nreports  on  pre-construction  activities  and  the  construction  of  civil  works,  including  (i)  physical \nand  financial  progress,  (ii)  the  status  of  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  (if  required),  (iii) \nenvironmental  management,  (iv)  institutional  development  and  capacity  building,  (v)  public \ncommunication  campaigns,  and  (vi)  other  activities  critical  to  project  implementation.  To \nfacilitate  performance  monitoring  and  post-project  review,  the  Government  has  agreed  to \nprovide ADB, within 3 months of the physical completion of the project, a completion report that \nwill cover implementation details, costs, and benefits, and any other information that ADB might \nrequire.  The  Government  will  also  provide  annual  reports  on  road  maintenance  budgets, \nactivities, and expenditures, and will submit annual audited financial statements, audited project \naccounts, audit reports, management letters, and other related statements to ADB no later than \n6 months after the end of each fiscal year throughout the implementation period. ADB will issue \na formal warning for audited accounts that are 6 months overdue and suspend disbursement for \naccounts that are 12 months overdue. \n \n52.  MID  will  maintain  separate  records  and  accounts  identifying  the  goods  and  services \nfinanced  from  the  grant,  the  expenditures  incurred  for  the  project,  and  the  use  of  counterpart \nfunds. The project accounts will be established and maintained according to sound accounting \nprinciples and practices consistent with internationally accepted accounting standards. External \nauditors acceptable to ADB will audit the project accounts and annual financial statements every \nyear.  The  audit  reports  will  include  an  auditor\u2019s  opinion  on  the  use  of  the  grant  proceeds  and \ncompliance with the financial covenants in the grant agreement. \n\n10. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n53.  Within 6 months of grant effectiveness, MID with the assistance of PMU will establish a \nproject performance and monitoring system. ADB and the Government, in consultation with the \nproject\u2019s  development  partners,  will  agree  on  a  set  of  indicators  for  monitoring  and  evaluating \nhow  well  the  project  achieves  its  goals  and  purposes.  These  indicators  will  be  refined  and \nmonitored  during  project  implementation.  The  indicators  will  include  data  for  monitoring \neconomic  development, \ntransport  sector  performance,  socioeconomic  development, \nenvironmental  impact,  maintenance,  and  institutional  development.  Monitoring  and  evaluation \nwill be based on gender-disaggregated data for social and poverty impact indicators. The PMU \nwill  provide  hands-on  training  in  data  collection,  monitoring,  and  evaluation  to  the  national \nconsultants and TPPU staff. This will allow monitoring to be maintained in the future. MID with \nassistance of PMU shall monitor and evaluate the indicators according to the agreed framework \non  a  quarterly  basis  to  determine  the  efficiency  and  effectiveness  of  the  Project  and  submit \nthem  to  ADB  through  the  quarterly  progress  reports.  Guidelines  for  baseline  values  for \nsubprojects, data collection and analysis, and future monitoring periods are in Appendix 11. \n\n13 \n\n \n\n\f14 \n\n11. \n\nProject Review \n\n54. \nADB and the Government will undertake semiannual reviews of the project, in which with \nAusAID and the European Commission have been invited to participate, to consider in detail the \n(i) scope of the project, (ii) implementation arrangements, (iii) compliance with grant covenants, \n(iv)  physical  achievements  against  targets  and  milestones,  and  (v)  project  implementation \nissues requiring resolution or action. The midterm review will be made within 12 months of the \ngrant effectiveness date. The midterm review will examine in detail the implementation progress \nand project design (institutional, administrative, organizational, technical, environmental, social, \npoverty reduction, resettlement, economic, and financial aspects), and identify courses of action \nthat  would  improve  project  performance,  viability,  and  the  achievement  of  targets  and  project \nobjectives. All the assumptions and risks noted in the design and monitoring framework will be \nreviewed.  \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACT, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\nA. \n\nExpected Benefits and Impacts \n\n1. \n\nProject Economic Justification \n\nTwo sample subprojects have been assessed. The estimated EIRR of the Guadalcanal \n55. \nsubproject is 42%, reflecting the central importance of restoring this main transport route to the \nnational economy.  The financial costs and economic evaluation of the Makira subproject, based \non the final detailed design cost estimate of $18.0 million, have been submitted. The economic \ninternal  rate  of  return  (EIRR)  is  estimated  to  be  11.3%,  marginally  lower  than  the  standard \nhurdle  rate  but  still  acceptable,  given  the  post-conflict  status  and  weak  performance  of  the \ncountry,  and  its  need  for  economic  stimulus  and  investment. 17  Considering  that  some  input \nparameters have been estimated conservatively and that a number of project benefits have not \nbeen quantified, sensitivity analysis shows the subproject to be reasonably robust to variations \nin input. The most sensitive variable is the construction cost, but the receipt of tenders before \nproject  approval  will  allow  this  risk  to  be  closely  managed.  The  EIRR  is  detailed  in \nSupplementary Appendix E. \n \n \n\n2. \n\nExpected Economic Benefits \n\nIn the case of Makira subproject, a total of 12,100 people will benefit from the improved \n56. \naccess. Economic benefits from the Makira subproject arise from (i) savings in time for people \nand goods transferring from foot and small boat to motorized land transport; (ii) improvements in \nhealth  status  for  residents  of  villages  newly  accessible  by  road  and  reduction  in  accidental \nfatalities,  mainly  through  drowning,  by  providing  safe  water  crossings and  associated  property \nlosses; (iii) income generation from stimulated agricultural production and commercial transport \nservices; and  (iv) net increase in revenue to transport operators (increase to road transport net \nof losses to coastal vessel operators).  \n \n\n                                                 \n17 ADB.  2007.  Achieving  Development  Effectiveness  in  Weakly  Performing  Countries  (The  ADB\u2019s  Approach  to \nEngaging  with  Weakly  Performing  Countries).  Manila.  Para.  49(i)  stipulates:  Programs  and  projects  in  weakly \nperforming  countries  should  not  be  expected  to  always  yield  the  same  financial  and  economic  rates  of  return  as \nwould  be  expected  in  stronger-performing  developing  member  countries.  If  ADB  wishes  to  continue  to  provide \ndevelopment assistance to weakly performing countries, it must recognize that the financial and economic risks of \ninvestments are higher and that lower returns are likely. \n\n \n\n\fFor the Guadalcanal subproject, the traffic volume measured at five locations along the \n57. \nroad section varies from 450 to 2,100 vehicles/day. Travel time savings from upgrading of the \nroad  surface  and  ease  of  negotiation  of  water  crossings  was  estimated  from  trip  times  before \nand after the February floods. A 15 minute increase in travel time over the route was found to \nhave occurred and this will be recovered with the rehabilitation and upgrading works. \n \n58. \nThe economic costs of disruption from prolonged route closures have been estimated in \ncategories of (i) loss of opportunity to market cash crops from the catchment area of the road. \nThese are copra, cocoa, betelnut, fish, and fresh fruits; (ii) loss of income for wage employees \ntravelling  to  work;  (iii)  loss  of  revenue  to  public  transport  services.  These  losses  have  been \nestimated only for travel from the communities served into Honiara, on the basis that this forms \nthe major focus for marketing produce and wage employment. \n \n59. \nIn  the  case  of  Guadalcanal  subproject,  a  total  of  29,000  people  will  benefit  from  the \nimproved access. The economic benefit estimates are regarded as conservative as a number of \neffects  have  been  left  unquantified,  as  the  quantified  benefits  already  provided  more  than \nsufficient  economic  justification  for  the  selected  subproject  option.  Unquantified  benefits  were \nassessed using a simple multi-criteria analysis to supplement the EIRR with factors of (i) mode \nswitching to or from coastal boat or foot; (ii) road safety costs; (iii) induced economic demand \nthrough service improvements and greater route reliability.  \n \n\n3. \n\nPoverty Reduction Impact \n\n60. \nThe  Project  will  reduce  poverty  by  improving  people\u2019s  access  to  local  and  provincial \nmarkets,  agricultural  fields,  water  supplies,  and  firewood,  thereby  offering  income  generation \nopportunities. The Project also will reduce poverty by offering direct employment on the project \nthrough  labor-intensive  contracts.  During  implementation,  employment  will  be  created  in \nrehabilitation and maintenance for civil works. Following completion, employment opportunities \nwill arise for routine maintenance conduced through LBES and traditional methods. By reducing \nthe  cost  and  time  of  travel,  inducing  economic  activities,  and  employing  people  directly,  the \nProject  will  improve  people\u2019s  incomes,  living  standards  and  food  security.  A  summary  poverty \nreduction and social strategy is in Appendix 12. \n \n\n4. \n\nSocial Impacts \n\n61. \nPositive  social  impacts  include  improved  access  to  education  facilities,  which  will  help \nraise school enrolment and retention rates, and improved access to health services, which will \npromote more frequent use and facilitate rapid care during medical emergencies. Other social \nbenefits  include  easier  access  to  administrative  and  service  centers,  including  communication \nfacilities. Potential adverse impacts include hazards to pedestrians, particularly from increased \nand  faster  traffic  flows  brought  about  by  road  rehabilitation.  These  risks  will  be  managed \nthrough  the  government's  road  safety  program.  Potential  adverse  impacts  include  hazards  to \npedestrians,  particularly  from  increased  and  faster  traffic  flows  brought  about  by  road \nrehabilitation. These risks will be managed through the government's road safety program.  \n \n62. \nGender-Inclusive Development. Poverty and social analysis at the subproject level will \nbe  gender-disaggregated.  It  will  take  into  account  (i)  the  differential  project  impacts  and  risks \nfacing women, (ii) gender-specific measures to mitigate adverse impacts and manage risks, and \n(iii) the interests and capacities of women to contribute to road rehabilitation and maintenance. \nThe  Project  will  be  proactive  in  ensuring  women\u2019s  involvement  in  road  rehabilitation  and \nmaintenance, HIV prevention, and the road safety activities. Women will directly benefit from the \n\n15 \n\n \n\n\fProject  in  terms  of  their  participation  in  LBES  contracts.  The  Project  will  also  encourage, \npromote and train female contractors as has been done under ongoing projects.  \n \n63. \nPublic  Health  Issues.  While  the  reported  number  of  infections  remains  low,  Solomon \nIslands  is  vulnerable  to  HIV.  Risk  factors  include  the  prevalence  of  sexually  transmitted \ninfections,  teenage  pregnancy,  gender  inequality  and  violence  against  women,  recent  violent \nsocial  conflict,  and  cultural  and  religious  factors.  Transport  systems  and  infrastructure \ndevelopment  are  recognized  internationally  as  a  vector  for  HIV  transmission.  However,  these \nrisks  are  small  due  to  low  population  densities  and  short  travel  distances  that  do  not  require \novernight  stops  by  service  providers  or  travelers.  Several  HIV  prevention  and  treatment \nprograms and projects are active in the Pacific region and Solomon Islands.  HIV education and \nprevention has been integrated into SIRIP (para. 37) and will be extended into the Project. \n \n 64.  Stakeholder  Participation  and  Consultation.  Stakeholder  consultations  were \nundertaken  during  the  original  design  of  the  Makira  subproject  in  2006.  Consultations  with \ndirectly  affected  persons  have  been  ongoing  during  the  feasibility  and  tender  preparation \ninterested  groups.  On \nphases,  with  memorandums  of  understanding  concluded  with \nGuadalcanal,  the  feasibility  studies  have  recently  been  completed.  Design  solutions  for  river \ncrossings  or  structures  have  been  determined  utilizing  the  same  consultative  process  as  has \nbeen  undertaken  on  Makira  subproject.  Poverty  and  social  surveys  together  with  public \nconsultations  and  other  baseline  surveys  have  been  conducted.  The  form  and  purpose  of  the \nProject  has  not  changed  from  that  originally  intended  and  these  improvements  are  well \nunderstood  by  the  communities,  as  reflected  in  their  willingness  to  assist  in  implementation \nwherever possible. \n \n65. \nIn  accordance  with  the  grant  covenants  of  SIRIP,  the  PMCBU  consultants  have \ndeveloped and implemented a communications program to ensure that all affected communities \nand civil works contractors engaged under the SIRIP participate in an HIV prevention program. \nNational  Aids  Council  (NAC)  approved  provider,  Save  the  Children  Australia  (SCA),  and  a \nnational  partner  NGO  (Nexus)  have  been  engaged  to  manage  the  provision  to  all  affected \ncommunities  of  awareness  relating  to  crosscutting  issues  including  HIV,  sexually  transmitted \ninfections  (STI)  and  the  protection  of  children  and  women.  The  HIV  program  has  been \ndeveloped  in  coordination  with  NAC  and  Ministry  for  Health  and  includes  the  distribution  of \nprinted  materials  to  communities  to  ensure  the  messages  and  information  are  available  for \ndiscussion  post  awareness.  The  program  has  been  implemented  in  Makira,  Temotu,  Malaita \nand Guadalcanal and will be extended to the Guadalcanal flood damaged subproject. Specific \nprovisions aimed at mitigating the risk of HIV are included in bidding documents for civil works \ncontracts involving construction campsites with foreign workers, and the PMCBU will be strictly \nmonitoring  compliance  once  implementation  is  underway.  All  awareness  workshops  have  a \ncommon  core  curricula  dealing  with  a  wide  range  environmental,  economic  and  social  issues \nincluding  (i)  prevention  of  STIs  and  HIV,  (ii)  prevention  of  exploitation  of  women  and  children, \n(iii)  mitigation  of  human,  environmental  and  biological  degradation,  (iv)  road  safety,  (v) \nemployment  and  income  generation  activities,  and  (vi)  responsibilities  of  contractors.  The \ninformation,  education  and  communication  material  covering  the  various  aspects  of  the \ncommunity  education  awareness  programs  were  distributed  in  affected  communities.  Specific \nseparate sessions are conducted with women. \n \n66. \nResettlement  Impacts.  Besides  4.5  km  of  new  road  in  Makira  subporoject,  the \nrehabilitation subprojects are not expected to require resettlement or land acquisition, as most \nof  the  works  will  be  undertaken  on  existing  roads  within  existing  rights-of-way.  The  exact \namount  of  land  to  be  acquired  for  the  4.5  km  length  will  not  be  made  known  until  the  final \n\n16 \n\n \n\n\fdesigns are completed. Ressettlement due diligence reports have been prepared for Makira and \nGuadalcanal  subprojects.  In  the  event  of  any  land  acquisition  or  resettlement  needs,  the \nGovernment  will  inform  ADB  and  prepare  a  resettlement  plan  according  to  relevant  laws  and \nregulations;  ADB\u2019s  Involuntary  Resettlement  Policy  (1995);  and  the  resettlement  framework. \nThe PMU will ensure that no construction activities begin until ADB has reviewed and approved \nsuch resettlement plan. \n \n67. \nIndigenous  People.  Native  Melanesians,  who  comprise  the  vast  majority  of  the \npopulation,  are  the  indigenous  people  of  Solomon  Islands.  For  the  indigenous  population,  the \nrehabilitation  subprojects  will  improve  access  to  health,  education,  livelihood,  and  social \nservices.  The  Project  is  not  expected  to  have  a  negative  impact  on  indigenous  peoples  that \nwould trigger ADB\u2019s Policy on Indigenous Peoples (1998).  \n \n\n5. \n\nEnvironmental Impacts \n\n68. \nThe  Project  is  classified  as  environmental  category  B  according  to  ADB\u2019s  Environment \nPolicy (2002) and Environmental Assessment Guidelines (2003). All road improvement activities \nwill  be  confined  to  existing  rights-of-way,  except  for  4.5  km  of  new  road  on  Makira  subproject \nwhere land acquisition will be required. IEEs have been conducted for Makira and Guadalcanal \nsubprojects to  develop  the  methodology  for  environmental  assessment  of  subprojects,  as  well \nas  an  environmental  assessment  review  process  (EARP).  The  IEE  findings  support  the \nclassification of the Project as category B. A summary initial environmental examination (IEE) of \nthe sector project, prepared in accordance with ADB\u2019s Environmental Assessment Guidelines, is \nin Supplementary Appendix F. ADB\u2019s assessment procedure is aligned with the environmental \nimpact assessment requirements of the Government\u2019s Environment Act (1998).  \n \n69. \nEach subproject will be subject to an IEE, which will include a detailed, site-specific EMP \nprepared  under  the  responsibility  of  the  PMU.  The  EMP  will  specify  the  required  mitigation \nmeasures  and  monitoring  activities  to  ensure  their  effectiveness.  Subproject  environmental \nselection criteria will ensure that the Project will not harm any ecologically or culturally sensitive \nareas.  The  construction  of  improved  drainage  structures,  stabilization  of  slopes  through \nbioengineering,  and  other  measures  undertaken  by  the  Project  will  have  long-term  beneficial \nimpacts on the environment. Short-term impacts will be unavoidable during construction. These \nmight include noise, dust, and other temporary impacts, such as loss of vegetation due to earth \nmoving,  and  minor  sedimentation  of  waterways  and  the  coastal  environment  near  the  shore. \nThese impacts will end with the completion of rehabilitation works, and methods specified in the \nenvironmental  management  plan  (EMP)  will  mitigate  them.  Adherence  to  best  engineering \npractices  during  rehabilitation,  and  strict  enforcement  of  the  EMP,  will  avoid  or  adequately \nmitigate all of the rehabilitation-related impacts. Each subproject will be subject to an IEE, which \nwill include a detailed, site-specific EMP prepared under the responsibility of the PMU. The EMP \nwill  specify  the  required  mitigation  measures  and  monitoring  activities  to  ensure  their \neffectiveness \n   \n\n6. \n\nPolicy and Institutional Improvements  \n\n70. \nThe  road  sector  institutional  development  component  supported  by  the  Project  will \nadvance  the  objectives  of  Government  policy  in  improving  the  efficiency  of  public  services \ndelivery. It also will create participation opportunities for the private sector contracting industry \nthrough performance-based maintenance contracts, as well as smaller LBES construction and \nrehabilitation packages. \n \n\n17 \n\n \n\n\f18 \n\nB. \n\nRisks \n\n1. \n\nTechnical Risks \n\nThe  design  of  bridges  at  the  larger  river  crossings  mitigates  against  the  risk  of  flood \n71. \ndamage even from a 50-year flood, and achieves an appropriate balance between the cost of \nreinstatement,  disruption  consequences,  and  construction  cost.  Other  structures  are  designed \nto minimize the risks of scouring and washouts. Site investigations have been limited to surface \nobservation and surveys; drilling to establish foundation conditions for bridge structures will be \nundertaken at the start of implementation. There is some technical risk that adverse foundation \nconditions could require deeper piling than estimated or reconsideration of the design solution \nor increased cost. The road alongside the flood plains will be raised and sealed with bitumen to \nprevent  the  erosion  of  pavement  materials  during  floods.  The  sections  of  road  lengths \nencountering a high water table will be raised with improved drainage. This risk is mitigated by \nan allowance for risk contingencies within the base cost estimate. \n \n\n2. \n\nSocial and Resettlement Risks \n\n72. \nSocial aspects were considered during SIRIP formulation and subproject approval. Initial \npoverty and social assessments (IPSAs) have been prepared for the two core subprojects, and \nthe IPSA for the Makira subproject has been accepted as final. The IPSAs are in Supplementary \nAppendixes  G  and  H.  A  summary  poverty  reduction  and  social  strategy,  which  takes  into \naccount the achievements of SIRIP to date and the findings of the IPSAs, is in Appendix 12. A \nresettlement  framework  for  the  project  and  due-diligence  reports  in  respect  of  resettlement \nissues for the two core subprojects have been prepared and are in Supplementary Appendixes I \nto K.  \n \n73. \nThe  changes  in  the  configuration  of  structures  in  the  Makira  subproject  since  the \npreparation of the original IPSA will not have a negative effect on social aspects; therefore, no \nfurther  analysis  and  screening  are  required.  Out  of  the  72.5  km  length  of  road,  land  will  be \nrequired  for  the  Makira  subproject  over  4.5  km  of  new  route  sections  for  three  relocated \nwatercourse  crossings.  Landowners  have  signed  memorandums  of  understanding  with  MID \nover  the  full  length,  agreeing  to  the  use  of  their  land  for  road  in  exchange  for  the  benefits \nprovided by the new bridge crossings. The land along the 4.5 km of road is undeveloped and \ndoes  not  contain  houses,  other  buildings,  agricultural  plots,  or  cultivated  trees.  A  resettlement \ndue diligence report has been prepared for the subproject and a short resettlement plan will be \nprepared during the final detailed design in accordance with existing resettlement framework. In \nthe  case  of  the  Makira  subproject,  the  realization  of  the  social  benefits  from  improved  access \nassumes  that  the  villagers  and  transport  operators  will  buy  vehicles  and  set  up  transport \nservices once the road connectivity is established. The responses during the consultation give \nconfidence  that  this  will  occur.  The  relocation  of  the  three  river  crossings  in  the  Makira \nsubproject  assumes  that  the  villagers  who  have  signed  memorandums  of  understanding  with \nMID will honor their agreement to provide land as a contribution to the subproject. \n \nRisks common to all rehabilitation subprojects will be addressed through the stakeholder \n74. \nconsultation plans. The mitigation measures include (i) the prevention of conflicts between local \npeople and contractors; (ii) road safety education by the provincial police and local NGOs; and \n(iii) an HIV awareness campaign in villages with the involvement of a specialized NGO and the \nprovincial Department of Health. A campaign to raise awareness will also be waged to maximize \nthe  benefits  from  the  subprojects.  All  awareness-building  activities  will  involve  local  and \ninternational NGOs working in the province, and provincial government agencies. \n\n \n\n\f \n75. \nThe expected impact on indigenous peoples puts the project in category B. Landowners \naffected  by  the  project  are  indigenous  people,  and  favorable  actions  are  set  out  in  the  IPSAs \n(Supplementary  Appendixes  G  and  H),  the  summary  poverty  reduction  and  social  strategy \n(Appendix 12), and the resettlement framework (Supplementary Appendix I). \n \n\n3. \n\nMaterials Acquisition \n\nLocal landowners in Solomon Islands commonly grant access to pavement materials as \n76. \ntheir  counterpart  contribution.  Clear  government  and  development  partner  policies  regarding \ncounterpart contributions mitigate the risk of demands for compensation. Landowners confirmed \ntheir  willingness  to  contribute  in  consultations  during  subproject  preparation,  and  have  signed \nmemorandums of understanding to that effect with MID. If required, MID will lease quarries and \nriver  gravel  sites  for  pavement  materials  and  borrow  pits  at  various  locations  within  Solomon \nIslands, and grant royalties in adequate compensation for materials extracted from these sites. \n \n\n4. \n\nPost-Conflict Environment  \n\n77.  While  the  post-conflict  environment  is  stable,  the  economy  has  not  recovered \nsubstantially  and  is  adversely  affected  by  the  current  global  economic  financial  crisis.  The \nbusiness  environment,  however,  is  increasingly  positive,  as  contractors  and  consultants \nrespond  to  business  opportunities.  If  political  instability  increases  or  there  is  a  deterioration  in \nlaw and order, reduced interest in the project among prospective bidders could increase tender \nprices  and  lessen  community  support  for  the  project.  Continuing  large-scale,  long-term \nassistance from development partners in the economic and post-conflict recovery efforts of the \nGovernment will mitigate this risk. \n \n\n5. \n\nFinancial Risks \n\n78. \nGovernment  counterpart  contributions,  particularly  where  cash  payments  are  required \nfor rehabilitation, road maintenance, and counterpart staff could be inadequate because of the \nongoing  impact  of  the  global  economic  and  financial  crisis,  despite  assurances.  The  risks \nrelated  to  government  counterpart  financing  will  be  mitigated  by:  (i) the  relatively  small \nproportion of government financing (4.83%) limits the effects on project objectives of any delay \nor  reduction  in  the  contribution;  (ii)  the  ADB-supported  full  operation  of  the  NTF  provides  a \nsecure  channel  of  financing  for  road  maintenance;  and  (iii)  the  inclusion  of  taxes  on  fuel  and \nplant inputs (but not gross sales tax) in project cost allows shortfalls in the Government\u2019s cash \ncontribution to be covered by a tax credit against tax components of the construction cost. The \ncounterpart contributions are relatively small in amount, and are within MID\u2019s ability to manage \nthrough the annual budget cycle. \n \n79. \nThe state of the construction market, the relative remoteness of the subprojects, and the \nvolatility of exchange rates and unit costs of construction input create a financial risk up to the \npoint of receipt and acceptance of construction tenders. This risk can be partially mitigated by \ncalling  for  tenders  in  advance  of  project  approval,  providing  an  opportunity  to  adjust  the \nsubproject  scope  and  design  if  necessary.  The  early  tendering  of  all  the  rehabilitation \ncomponents will also mitigate the risks of inflationary effects over the term of the project.  \n \nAdequate  financial  management  skills  within  MID,  supported  by  the  PMU,  will  be \n80. \nimportant for the achievement of the project\u2019s objectives and the long-term sustainability of its \nimpact. A financial management assessment found a significant improvement in procedures and \n\n19 \n\n \n\n\faffirmed  the  contribution  of  the  financial  management  system  put  in  place  by  the  project \nmanagement and capacity building unit established under SIRIP. \n \n\n6. \n\nEnvironmental Impact Risks \n\n81. \nSubproject  approval  processes  are  part  of  the  environmental  assessment  and  review \nprocedure set out in Supplementary Appendix A. The initial environmental examination (IEE) for \nthe  Makira  core  subproject  (Supplementary  Appendix B)  posted  on  ADB\u2019s  website  has  been \naccepted. Another IEE, for the Guadalcanal subproject (Supplementary Appendix C), concluded \nthat the environmental impact will be minimal and can be readily mitigated.  The  Guadalcanal \nsubproject  is  in  a  coastal  area  where  coconut  and  cocoa  plantations  are  interspersed  with \nsubsistence gardens and regenerating scrubland. There are no protected areas or community-\nbased marine protected areas in the subproject area. The Guadalcanal subproject will involve \nthe  repair  and  rehabilitation  of  culverts,  scour  protection,  river  training  works,  and  the \nreconstruction  or  repair  of  bridges,  all  within  existing  rights-of-way,  and  no  land  acquisition  or \nresettlement will be required.  \n \n\n7. \n\nInstitutional Risks \n\n82. \nThe sustainability of the Project hinges on the availability of dedicated funding for road \nmaintenance  and  investment,  supplied  through  the  NTF.  The  NTF  Act  was  passed  by \nParliament  in  2008  and  operational  regulations  are  now  being  finalized.  In  the  interim,  MID \nprovides maintenance funding through a dedicated budget line item. \n \nContinued  progress  in  restructuring  MID  and  developing  its  management  systems  to \n83. \ntransform the ministry into a planning and asset management agency depends on the continued \nsuccess  of  reforms  under  ADB  TA  and  adequate  government  funding.  One  risk  is  that  the \nGovernment\u2019s  commitment  to  reform,  and  the  associated  development  and  implementation  of \noperating and management procedures, could wane. Resource shortages within MID present a \nfurther risk. The project will mitigate these risks through close collaboration and cooperation with \nthe  ongoing  TA,  involving  consultations  between  the  Government,  the  private  sector,  and  the \ngeneral public (footnote 7). ADB project and TA review missions, as well as country consultation \nmissions,  will  engage  in  regular  dialogue  with  stakeholders  to  maintain  support  and \ncommitment.  \n \n84. \nADB will continue to work closely with development partners to promote improvements \nin  sector  governance,  including  an  operational  NTF  providing  sustainable  funding  for \ninfrastructure  maintenance,  program  and  contract  management  capability  within  MID,  and \nprivate sector contracting capacity, with support from the PMU.  \n \n\n8. \n\nClimate Change Risks \n\n85. \nClimate change effects in the South Pacific include a probable increase in the frequency \nand  severity  of  tropical storms  and in  the  associated  rainfall  intensity,  duration,  and  flood  risk. \nLogging in stream catchments reduces the concentration time and increases debris loads. The \nproject  will  mitigate  climate  change  risks  to  the  rehabilitation  subprojects  by  funding \nclimate change\u2013resistant  designs  for  watercourse  crossings,  reducing  the  risk  that  large  flood \nevents  will  destroy  critical  infrastructure,  severing  road  links  with  uncertain  priority,  and  timing \nrestoration  projects.  Climate  change  adaptation  measures  are  detailed  in  Supplementary \nAppendix D. \n \n\n20 \n\n \n\n\f9. \n\nOverall Assessment \n\n86. \nThe  core  road  rehabilitation  subprojects  are  subject  to  technical  risks  that  are  largely \nwithin the control of MID through the PMU. These risks can be satisfactorily mitigated through \nsound  project  management  and  supervision.  The  design  provides  for  the  mitigation  of  climate \nchange  risk.  The  financial  risks  in  regard  to  securing  parallel  financing  and  the  Government\u2019s \ncounterpart contribution can be mitigated. The financial risks involved in any variance between \nthe  tendered  contract  prices  and  the  design  estimate  will  be  known  by  the  time  the  project  is \napproved. The environmental risks are minor and capable of mitigation. The social effects\u2014the \nbenefits  of  new  and  restored  access\u2014are  largely  positive.  Strict  measures  to  control  the \nadverse impact of construction on local communities including HIV control are, or will be, put in \nplace. Overall, the benefits of applying the additional resources required to complete the project \nare expected to greatly outweigh the costs, given the recognized risks and mitigation strategy. \nOverall,  the  risks  are  sufficiently  manageable  and  do  not  constitute  any  barriers  to  project \napproval. \n \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES  \n\nA. \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  and  MID  have  given  the \n87. \nfollowing assurances in respect of the project, which will be incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\nLand  acquisition  and  resettlement.  In  the  event  of  any  land  acquisition  or \nresettlement needs, the Government will inform ADB and prepare a resettlement \nplan according to relevant laws and regulations; ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement \nPolicy  (1995);  and  the  resettlement  framework.  The  PMU  will  ensure  that  no \nconstruction  activities  begin  until  ADB  has  reviewed  and  approved  such \nresettlement plan. \n\nEnvironment.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  no  subproject  assessed  as \ncategory  A  (significant  adverse  impact)  will  be  approved  under  the  project.  The \nGovernment,  through  the  PMU,  will  ensure  that  (a)  the  IEE  and  the  preliminary \nenvironmental  management  plan  (EMP)  are  reviewed  and  updated  at  the \nengineering design stage; (b) each subproject complies with the EMP reflected in \nthe  updated  IEE,  all  applicable  national  environmental  laws,  regulations,  and \nguidelines,  and  ADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy  (2002);  (c)  the  EMP  is  reflected  as \npart  of  bidding  documents  and  civil  works  contracts;  (d)  any  adverse \nenvironmental  impact  arising  from  the  project  is  minimized  through  the \nimplementation of the agreed mitigating measures; (e) environmental monitoring \nis  done  by  the  PMU  and  the  contractors;  and  (f)  the  required  EARP  are \nimplemented.  Further, \nthe  Ministry  of  Environment,  Conservation  and \nMeteorology (MECM) will identify a single point of contact within its environment \nunit  for  the  project;  MECM  will  take  steps  to  expedite  the  processing  of  the \nGuadalcanal  subproject,  for  which  an  IEE  has  also  been  lodged,  and  all \nsubsequent subprojects. \n\nGender  and  employment.  MID  will  (a)  require  project  contractors  to  employ  a \nminimum  of  33%  women  in  road  rehabilitation  and  labor-intensive  maintenance \nof selected national roads; (b) provide equal pay to men and women for work of \nequal type, in accordance with national laws and international treaty obligations \n\n21 \n\n \n\n\fand to pay women's wages directly to them; (c) provide safe working conditions \nfor male and female workers; (d) ensure that at least 20% of road maintenance \ncontractors  are  women;  and  (e)  ensure  that  project  contractors  comply  with \napplicable  labor  laws  and  abstain  from  using  child  labor.  Specific  provisions  to \nthis effect will be included in the bidding documents. The PMU will be responsible \nfor  monitoring  the  employment  targets  for  women  by  reviewing  periodically  the \npayroll  statements  of  the  construction  contractors,  and  will  reflect  progress  in \nachieving the employment targets for women in the project progress reports and \nproject completion report. \n\nHealth  risks. MID will ensure that all civil works contractors engaged under the \nproject participate in an HIV prevention program in construction campsites to be \nfunded under the project. The PMU will ensure that similar information on the risk \nof transmission of HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases is disseminated to \nlocal communities in the corridor of project influence, in coordination with national \nagencies working on this issue. The PMU will include specific provisions to this \neffect in civil works contracts, and will strictly monitor compliance. \n\nProject performance monitoring and evaluation. Within 6 months of the grant \neffectiveness  date,  MID  shall  finalize  and  adopt  a  project  performance  and \nmonitoring  system  acceptable  to  ADB,  based  on  indicators  and  procedures \nagreed  on  between  the  Government  and  ADB.  MID  shall  monitor  the  indicators \naccording  to  the  agreed  framework  on  a  quarterly  basis  to  determine  the \nefficiency and effectiveness of the Project and submit them to ADB through the \nquarterly progress reports.  \n\n \nConditions for Grant Effectiveness \n\nB. \n\nGrant  effectiveness  is  dependent  on  the  Government\u2019s  obtaining  the  approval  of  the \n88. \ngrants to be provided by the European Commission and the Government of Australia or having \nmade other arrangements, satisfactory to ADB, to commit the provision of the foreign currency \nfunds intended to be provided by the European Commission and the Government of Australia. \n\nVI. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n89. \nI am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and,  acting  in  the  absence  of  the  President,  under  the \nprovisions  of  Article  35.1  of  the  Articles  of  Agreement  of  ADB,  I  recommend  that  the  Board \napprove \n \n\nthe  grant  not  exceeding  $15,000,000  to  Solomon  Islands  from  ADB\u2019s  Special \nFunds  resources  for  the  Second  Road  Improvement  (Sector)  Project,  on  terms \nand  conditions  that  are  substantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the \ndraft Grant Agreement presented to the Board; \n\nthe  administration  by  ADB  of  the  grant  not  exceeding  the  equivalent  of \n$4,500,000  to  Solomon  Islands  for  the  Second  Road  Improvement  (Sector) \nProject to be provided by the Government of Australia; \n\n22 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n(iv) \n\n \n(v) \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n \n\n\f(iii)  \n\n \n(iv) \n\nthe  administration  by  ADB  of  the  grant  not  exceeding  the  equivalent  of \n$3,340,000  to  Solomon  Islands  for  the  Second  Road  Improvement  (Sector) \nProject to be provided by the European Commission; and \n\nthe  expansion  of  procurement  eligibility  for  the  Second  Road  Improvement \n(Sector)  Project  to  allow  procurement  of  civil  works,  goods  and  services  from \nthose  countries  eligible  for  procurement  under  the  European  Commission \nregulations, which are non-ADB member countries. \n\nC.

The network comprises 220 km of main roads, 480 km of secondary roads, 850 km \nof provincial roads, 150 km of Honiara town roads, and about 250 km of private and plantation \naccess  roads.  The country  has  an  estimated  800  km  of  logging  roads. The  road  network  also \nhas about 200 bridges and is linked by 120 wharves. Sea is the dominant mode of transport in \nSolomon  Islands.  The  Ministry  of  Infrastructure  and  Development  (MID)  manages  all  roads \ncomprising main, secondary, provincial, and urban roads. \n \nAbout  60%  of  the  network  (excluding  Honiara  town  roads)  is  on  Guadalcanal  and \n2. \nMalaita,  which  serve  about  90%  of  the  traffic  in  the  country.  About  1,570  km  have  a  graveled \nsurface  and  about  100  km  of  main  roads,  mostly  on  Guadalcanal  and  Malaita,  and  50  km  of \nHoniara  town  roads  are  sealed.  Other  provinces  have  relatively  short  coastal  segments  of \ngravel  or  earth  roads  around  provincial  centers.  Compared  with  other  Pacific  island  countries, \nthe  road  density  is low:  Solomon  Islands  has  less  than  0.07  km  of  road  per  square  kilometer, \nand only 0.005 km per capita. About 23% of villages are accessible by road (normally by cars or \ntrucks), 32% by sea, 40% by walking tracks, and 5% by river. \n \n3. \nThe  main  roads  serve  the  densely  populated  areas  linking  the  main  centers  with \ncommercial centers, markets, and main ports. The secondary roads are extensions to the main \nroad network, or serve provincial and subprovincial centers and rural communities on the main \nislands.  Provincial  roads  serve  a  similar  function  to  secondary  roads.  They  also  connect \nagricultural  areas  and  villages  to  wharves,  and  provide  access  to  social  services,  including \nschools, clinics, and markets. \n \n4. \nApart from the donor-funded road programs, the main, secondary, and provincial roads \nwere not built to appropriate standards and have suffered from lack of maintenance over many \nyears.1  Routine  maintenance  contracts  currently  exist  over  170  km  of  roads  on  Guadalcanal, \nTemotu, and Malaita under Solomon Islands Road Improvement (Sector) Project (SIRIP), with \n300  km  of  roads  on  Malaita  being  maintained  under  force-account  arrangements  through  the \nCommunity  Sector  Program  of  the  Australian  Agency  for  International  Development  (AusAID). \nAs  a  result,  the  rest  of  the  network  is  in  poor  condition.  It  provides  inadequate  rural  access, \nthereby  constraining  economic  growth  and  development,  poverty  reduction,  and  social \ndevelopment.  In  the  rural  areas,  the  potential  for  cash  crop  production  is  underdeveloped \nprimarily because of irregular farm-to-market access, which leaves much of the rural population \nreliant on subsistence livelihoods. Resource-based industries also rely on a suitable standard of \nroads to market their production for export. \n \n5. \nAbout  65%  of  roads  (those  not  being  maintained)  have  deteriorated  to  such  an  extent \nthat  damage  to  vehicles  that  regularly  use  the  roads  is  common,  and  the  roads  are  at  times \nimpassable  for  cars  and  light  trucks.  Road  surfaces  are  deformed  and  eroded  in  places, \ndrainage  is  not  working  properly,  and  vegetation  is  overgrown,  raising  safety  concerns.  Many \nlog bridges have exceeded their design life, with only about 25% remaining in good condition, \n30% requiring minor repairs, 37% requiring major repairs, and 8% not open to traffic. The poor \n\n                                                 \n1   ADB.  2000.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors  on  a  Proposed  Loan  to \nSolomon  Islands  for  the  Post-Conflict  Emergency  Rehabilitation  Project.  Manila  (Loan  1823/Grant  0043/0044-\nSOL). \n\n \n\n\f28 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\ncondition  of  many  roads  has  lowered  traveling  speeds,  while  increasing  fuel  consumption  and \nvehicle operating costs. The rough road surfaces have also reduced the economic lives of the \nvehicles, and suppressed road transport demand. \n \nDevelopment  partners  are  assisting  with  road  rehabilitation  and  bridge  works  in  areas \n6. \nworst affected by several years of conflict (1999\u20132003), and with the restoration of some wharf \nfacilities throughout the country. However, much more needs to be done urgently. \n\nB. \n\nTraffic Volume \n\n7. \nSolomon Islands has about 11,000 vehicles, 90% of which are on Guadalcanal (75% in \nthe  capital Honiara),  8%  in  Malaita,  1%  in  Western,  and the  remaining  1%  in  other  provinces. \nPrivate cars and taxis, light trucks, and medium trucks (up to 8 tons, 2 axles) are the dominant \nvehicle  types.  Larger  multi-axle  and  articulated  trucks  are  rare  except  in  Honiara  and  specific \nmining  and  logging  areas.  The  fleet  of  large  trucks  in  Guadalcanal  is  forecast  to  increase \nconsiderably over 2010\u20132015 with the development of mining and oil palm activities. This might \nresult  in  axle  loads  of  up  to  11  tons  (dual-wheel)  and  up  to  8  tons  on  single-wheel  axles. \nMotorcycles, motor scooters, and bicycles are not common in Solomon Islands. \n \n8. \nThe  primary  causes  of  road  deterioration  in  Solomon  Islands  are  high  rainfall,  poor \ndrainage,  and  lack  of  maintenance,  combined  with  poor  road  construction.  Maintenance  of \ndrains  is  essential  in  areas  of  high  rainfall  and  in  steep  areas.  Heavy  axle  loads,  the  primary \ncause of road damage in other countries, are not common in Solomon Islands, except on a few \nmining  and  logging  roads.  However,  with  the  increase  in  heavy  vehicles  in  some  areas,  the \namount of damage is likely to increase unless roads are properly engineered and constructed \nfor  the  higher  loads,  and  laws  against  the  overloading  of  vehicles  are  enforced.  However,  the \nexisting  Solomon  Islands  Roads  Act,  1955  is  outdated  and  does  not  adequately  address  the \noverloading of vehicles. Additionally, MID does not have a law enforcement unit and has no staff \nor budget to monitor vehicle loads and law enforcement. \n\nC. \n\nTransport Services \n\nThe  majority  of  vehicles  in  the  Solomon  Islands  are  privately  owned.  Privately  owned \n9. \nminibuses  and  taxis  are  the  leading  form  of  public  road  transport,  particularly  in  Honiara. \nAvailable  public  transport  is  reduced  outside  Honiara.  Public  transport  in  rural  areas  generally \ntakes the form of light trucks that combine goods and passenger services. Walking is the most \ncommon  form  of  travel  for  distances  up  to  10  km.  A  few  small  and  medium-sized  private \noperators provide all the road freight services. In Honiara, a few companies operate heavy and \narticulated  trucks,  and  have  container  transport  capabilities.  In  addition,  private  logging  trucks \nprovide services to the forestry sector. Although fares are not regulated, market forces ensure \nthey reflect operating costs. \n\nD. \n\nRoad Safety \n\nFigures obtained from MID show that, on average, six people die in road accidents per \n10. \nyear (1996 through 2003). That equates to a rate of five deaths per 10,000 vehicles, relatively \nlow by international standards. The low average speeds and low total distance traveled appear \nto contribute to this low road toll. \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n29 \n\nE. \n\nInstitutional Framework  \n\n11. \nThe  institutional  framework  of  MID,  which  has  responsibility  for  road  management,  is \nevolving.  The  former  Ministry  of  Transport,  Works  and  Communications  was  transformed  in \n2001  into  MID,  which  is  responsible  for  the  management  and  development  of  the  national, \nprovincial, and urban road network.  \n \n12. \nThe  MID\u2019s  transport  planning  and  policy  unit  (TPPU)  and  land  transport  division  have \nrecently been merged into one department, transport infrastructure management services. The \nland transport division is now known as the operation and maintenance division. \n \n13. \nTPPU  is  responsible  for  policy  preparation,  planning,  and  programming  of  road  and \nbridge works, and the operation and maintenance division for their design and implementation. \nTPPU has been restructured to address its responsibilities as a policy and planning unit for all \nmodes of transport infrastructure and to become more focused on asset management. Similarly, \nthe  operation  and  maintenance  division\u2019s  structure  has  been  remodeled \nthe \nimplementation  of  the  policy  of  outsourcing  maintenance  and  capital  works,  and  is  more \ndirected toward asset management.  \n \n14. \nStaffing  and  recruitment  have  been  problematic  in  MID,  which  has  been  seeking \nadditional staff to fill vacancies in the revised structure. Further recruitment is planned in 2009 \nand  2010  for  both  divisions.  On-the-job  training  in  planning,  programming,  budgeting,  contract \nmanagement, supervision, quality assurance, and project management is continuing for the staff \nin these two divisions under SIRIP. MID will continue to seek additional staff and make full use \nof training offered by the various technical assistance (TA) projects and under the second-phase \nproject. \n\nto  suit \n\nF. \n\nGovernment Vision and Strategy  \n\n15. \nNational Development Plan. The Government\u2019s development vision, mission, priorities, \nand  national  objectives  are  articulated  in  the  Medium-Term  Development  Strategy  (MTDS) \n2008\u20132010. The overall national development goal of MTDS is to improve the quality of life and \nliving  standards  of  all  the  people  in  Solomon  Islands.  This  goal  is  to  be  achieved  by  ensuring \npeace, harmony, and personal safety among the people; increasing incomes and their equitable \ndistribution;  and  increasing  the  availability  of,  and  improving  access  to,  social  services  for \neveryone.  This  would  lead  to  equitable  distribution  of  development  among  all  provinces  and \npeople  within  each  province,  social  groups,  and  genders.  The  priority  areas  of  MTDS  2008\u2013\n2010 are \n \n\nreconciliation and rehabilitation, \nnational security and foreign relations, \ninfrastructure development, \nsocial services, \neconomic and productive sectors, and \ncivic affairs. \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n(iv) \n(v) \n(vi) \n \n16. \nThe realization of these objectives hinges on increasing personal mobility and removing \nconstraints on the transportation of goods between areas of production and markets. Improving \nnational security requires ensuring that law enforcement officers and justice administrators can \nrespond  quickly  to  emerging  threats  to  peace  and  order,  as  and  where  they  occur.  Effective, \nefficient,  and  transparent  governance  in  other  areas  of  government  administration  similarly \n\n \n\n\f30 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\nrequires improved access within outlying areas of the country, which is reliant on infrastructure \ndevelopment. Social services, such as basic health and education facilities, as and where they \nare being provided, will be effective only if complementary transport infrastructure and services \nthat  are  accessible  to  a  higher  proportion  of  the  population  are  developed.  Economic  growth, \nparticularly in the production and distribution of tradable goods, depends on adequate, reliable, \naffordable, and secure transportation. \n \n17. \nThus, the improvement of transport infrastructure is fundamental to the realization of the \nobjectives of MTDS 2008\u20132010. Transport improvements have an indirect impact on social and \neconomic  development,  and  play  a  supporting  role  to  the  direct  components  of  MTDS  2008\u2013\n2010  in  other  sectors.  Therefore,  transport  must  develop  and  improve  in  concert  with  other \ndevelopments.  \n \n18. \nNational  Transport  Policy.  National  transport  policies  and  strategies  are  contained  in \nthe Transport Sector Strategy. Policies will focus immediately on the rehabilitation of transport \ninfrastructure in areas of most need. In the longer term, the Government\u2019s road subsector policy \nis to \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n(v) \n\n(vi) \n(vii) \n(viii) \n\nrestore  the  network  of  roads  and  bridges  to  conditions  that  promote  economic \ndevelopment and enhance social welfare and security;  \nextend  the  scope  of  the  maintainable  road  network  in  accordance  with \nsocioeconomic criteria;  \nestablish an effective and efficient maintenance and asset management system, \nincluding sustainable funding;  \nimprove the safety, quality, and reliability of transport services;  \npromote  private  sector  consultation  on  policies  and  works  planning  and \nprogramming;  \npromote private sector participation in contracting and service provision;  \nencourage appropriate community participation; and  \nprotect social and environmental standards, and the interests of the socially and \neconomically disadvantaged. \n\n \nThe  Government\u2019s  strategy  is  to  rebuild  high-priority  roads  to  design  standards \n19. \nappropriate  to  the  traffic,  topography,  and  climate  adaptation  requirements.  Improvements \nneeded  include  the  repair  and  replacement  of  bridges,  the  reshaping  and  strengthening  of \npavement,  and  the  improvement  of  drainage  (additional  culverts  and  cross  drains).  Feeder \nroads connecting village settlements and farms with main roads should also be considered for \nimprovement. The Government, through development partners, is  \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nrehabilitating high-priority roads and bridges on Guadalcanal, Malaita, and other \nrural provinces; \nstrengthening the capacity and capability of MID and private consulting sector to \nundertake project management, contract management, contract supervision, and \nroad asset management; and  \nestablishing a dedicated transport fund with sustainable revenues from road user \ncharges. \n\n \n20. \nThe  Government\u2019s  limited  domestic  resources  dictate  that  external  agencies  will \ncontinue to fund most sector development. Similarly, the low capacity and capability of the local \nconstruction industry requires a heavy dependence on international consultants to carry out the \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n31 \n\nworks.  Asset  management  capability  is  being  significantly  enhanced,  enabling  follow-up \nmaintenance works to be carried out effectively and efficiently.  \n \n21. \nNational  Transport  Plan.  The  Transport  Sector  Strategy  is  being  implemented \naccording  to  the  National  Transport  Plan  (NTP).  The  NTP  provides  the  framework  and  action \nplan  for  developing  and  maintaining  physical  infrastructure,  facilitating  transport  services, \nimproving the capacity of government agencies, and enhancing private sector participation. The \nNTP, which will be updated every 5 years, is supported by a 3-year rolling work program, which \nis updated annually.  \n \n22. \nA national transport task force has been established to assist and advise on key issues \nand  development  options.  The  task  force  comprises  representatives  of  government  agencies \nresponsible  for  social  and  economic  planning  and  development,  and  representatives  of \ntransport users and transport service providers. The task force endorsed the NTP in June 2006. \n \n23. \nA  key  element  of  the  NTP  is  its  assessment  of  the  priorities  for  rehabilitation, \nmaintenance, and investment in the expansion of the national network across the three modes \nof land, sea, and air transport. This assessment is based on the practicality of providing access \nby  the  different  modes  of  transport  available  in  rural  areas.  The  NTP  decision  framework  is \nbased on assessments of  \n \n\nexisting networks; \ntechnical feasibility of providing access by different modes;  \npositive and negative economic, social, and environmental impact; and  \nthe need for connecting infrastructure.  \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n(iv) \n \n24 \nAfter  potential  subprojects  were  identified,  they  were  prioritized  on  the  basis  of  a \nmulti-criteria analysis of economic benefits, social welfare considerations, environmental impact, \nand intercommunity peace and reconciliation needs. \n \n25. \nThe  NTP  contains  detailed  transport  sector  and  subsector  road  maps  for  all  modes  of \ntransport,  as  well  as  time-based  action  plans  for  transport  infrastructure  preservation  and \ndevelopment.  These  plans  detail  actions  required,  assign  responsibilities  for  implementation, \nand identify the associated costs and proposed sources of funding. The methodology is based \non a least-cost life-cycle analysis of prioritized subprojects, as well as a full analysis of the road \nsubsector\u2019s contribution to development objectives in various locations. Since the plan covers all \nmodes of transport, alternatives to road rehabilitation are considered in this prioritization. \n \n26. \nThe  NTP  also  covers  organizational  reforms  and  human  resource  development \nprograms to ensure that the required capacity is in place during the planning period. The NTP is \nintended to embody sufficient flexibility to meet emerging needs, constraints, and opportunities. \nIt  is  designed  to  satisfy  eligibility  criteria  associated  with  development  partner  programs.  The \nNTP will be reviewed and updated periodically, and incorporate new government policies. \n \nSector  Finance  and  the  National  Transport  Fund.  The  Government  has  invested \n27. \nabout  $11.0  million  of  its  own  resources  and  $96  million in  external  assistance  to develop  the \nroad  subsector  from  1991\u20132009  (Appendix  5).  Given  the  large  investment  needs  and \nconstrained public finances, the Government will continue to rely on external assistance for road \nrehabilitation and development.  \n \n\n \n\n\f32 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\nA  significant  portion  of  the  road  network  requires  reconstruction  and  ongoing \n28. \nmaintenance.  Road  maintenance  funding  has  averaged  $0.5  million  since  1990,  with  a \ntemporary drop of 80% to an average of $0.1 million during the conflict (1998\u20132002), resulting in \nwidespread deterioration. Funding is significantly below the levels necessary to sustain current \nassets.  What  proportion  goes  toward  maintenance,  versus  public  sector  overhead  costs,  is \nunclear  because  of  limited  accountability.  Current  maintenance  contracts  under  SIRIP  cover \n10% (170 km) of the road network and cost about $1.2 million annually. Maintaining the 20% of \nroads that remain in good or fair condition would cost an estimated $2.4 million annually. The \nbenefits of road rehabilitation will not be realized unless a comprehensive maintenance program \ncontinues to be implemented. \n \n29. \nTo address the shortfall in maintenance funding, the Government has set up a dedicated \nNational  Transport  Fund  (NTF),  supported  by  TA2  from  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB). \nThe  Government  has  proceeded  to  make  increasing  annual  contributions,  intended  to \neventually  match  sector  maintenance  needs.  The  NTF  will  also  raise  revenue  from  road  user \ncharges,  which  are  appropriate  for  transport  infrastructure  preservation.  The  anticipated \nmagnitude of the NTF will be sufficient to maintain all rehabilitated roads. \n \n30. \nThe  NTF  task  force  comprises  a  range  of  stakeholders  from  the  Government  and  the \nprivate  sector,  and  manages  the  NTF  on  the  basis  of  sound  business  principles.  Regulations \nare  being  prepared  to  operationalize  the  NTF  to  be  managed  by  the  board  of  directors.  The \nboard  will  be  required  to  report  transparently  on  its  current  activities  and  future  plans.  The \noperations of the NTF are being designed to ensure more needs-related funding, as well as a \nmore reliable flow and better deployment of funding. \n\nG. \n\nMain Challenges and Issues \n\n31. \nGiven its involvement in road maintenance and rehabilitation, AusAID brought in about \n$2.70  million  of  road  construction  and  maintenance  plant  and  equipment  in  2006  for  the \nmaintenance  of  Malaita  roads.  Deployment  for  this  plant  was  through  the  Community  Sector \nProgram and included the employment of both national and expatriate staff. With the activities of \nthe  program  being  transferred  back  to  MID  by  30  June  2010,  options  for  the  disposal  of  the \nplants and equipment are currently being considered.  \n \n32. \n \n\nThe Government faces a number of challenges regarding road transport infrastructure:  \n\nresolving the scarcity and unreliability of budget allocations to the sector,  \nrecognizing that maintenance has higher priority than new works, and  \ndeveloping asset management capability from planning to implementation. \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n \nThe major issues include the following: \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n(iv) \n(v) \n\nrehabilitating roads;  \nmoving from a reactive to a preventive maintenance approach;  \nincreasing spending to maintain the current road network;  \nensuring that road design recognizes life-cycle costs; \ninstituting  sustainable  arrangements  for  managing  and  maintaining  roads, \nparticularly with labor-based methods;  \n\n                                                 \n2   ADB.  2007.

Manila. \n\n \n\n\f34 \n\nAppendix 4 \n\nA. \n\nObjectives \n\nSTATUS OF SIRIP AND RATIONALE FOR A SECOND PHASE \n\nThe  Solomon  Islands  Road  Improvement  (Sector)  Project  (SIRIP)  was  funded  by  the \n1. \nAsian Development Bank (ADB), the Australian Agency for International Development (AusAID), \nthe  New  Zealand  Agency  for  International  Development,  and  the  Government  of  Solomon \nIslands  and  was  aimed  at  (i)  making  social  services  more  accessible  to  poor  and  rural \nhouseholds,  (ii)  increasing  opportunities  for  employment  and  income  generation  among  poor \nand  rural  households,  (iii)  increasing  private  sector  participation  in  economic  activities,  (iv) \nreducing  rural  poverty  by  bringing  about  the  development  of  remote  areas,  and  (v)  giving \npreference to areas of previous underinvestment.1  \n\nB. \n\nScope \n\n2. \nThe  scope  of  SIRIP  included  rehabilitating  up  to  100  kilometers  (km)  of  provincial  and \nsecondary  rural  gravel  roads  and  40  watercourse  crossings  (bridges,  culverts,  and  wet \ncrossings),  establishing  a  program  for  routine  maintenance,  developing  and  establishing  a \nrobust  asset  management  system,  and  building \nthe  capacity  of  national  contractors, \nconsultants,  and  the  staff  of  the  Ministry  of  Infrastructure  Development  (MID)  for  planning, \ncontracting,  and  quality  assurance  processes  and  management.  Subproject  selection  was \nbased on the priorities established in the National Transport Plan (NTP). \n\n3. \nThe  road  rehabilitation  envisaged  a  standard  that  would  provide  basic  all-weather, \nfour-wheel  drive  access  on  road  sections  and  passable  watercourse  crossings  except  during \nperiods  of  flood,  commensurate  with  the  size  of  population,  and  social  and  economic \ndevelopment  in  the  areas  served.  Rehabilitation  included  limited  upgrading,  such  as \nconstructing short sealed sections through villages or on steep gradients, and reconstruction of \nbridges where conditions and circumstances required it. \n\nC. \n\nCost Estimates and Financing Plan \n\nThe total cost of SIRIP was originally estimated at $16.850 million, comprising a base \n4. \ncost  of  $15.765  million  and  $1.085  million  in  contingencies.

The  grant  financing \ncomprised  $0.35  million  from  ADB\u2019s  Asian  Development  Fund  (1.80%  of  project  cost),  $8.65 \nmillion  from  the  Government  of  Australia  (44.59%  of  project  cost),  and  $9.75  million  from  the \nGovernment  of  New  Zealand  (50.26%  of  project  cost).  ADB  administered  all  of  the  grant \nfinancing.  \n\nD. \n\nStatus and Progress of Project Implementation \n\n7. \nSince  the  inception  of  SIRIP,  all  three  project  components  (road  rehabilitation,  road \nmaintenance  improvement,  and  project  management  and  capacity  building)  have  progressed \nand  are  estimated  to  be  42%  complete.  A  total  of  13  contracts  have  been  awarded\u2014nine  for \ncivil  works  for  road  maintenance  under  national  competitive  bidding  and  four  for  consulting \nservices. Contract awards total $5.55 million (30% of the approved amount) and disbursements \ntotal  $2.77  million  (15%  of  the  approved  amount).  The  major  civil  works  contracts  are  for  the \nroad  rehabilitation  component.  The  road  rehabilitation  subprojects  have  been  identified  and \nprioritized  under  the  NTP.  The  Makira  subproject,  the  rehabilitation  of  a  coastal  road  on  the \nisland  of  Makira  stretching  about  7  km  east  and  61  km  to  the  west  of  the  provincial  capital \nKirakira, was made the first priority for rehabilitation under SIRIP. The invitation of bids for this \nsubproject  closed  on  4  August  2009  and  contract  award  is  scheduled  for  the  end  of \nSeptember 2009.  \n\n8. \nThe covenants in the grant agreement have mostly been complied with. These required \nthe Government to (i) ensure that MID has enough budget to maintain staffing and support its \nroutine operations, including per diem and local transport for staff participating in field activities; \n(ii) ensure that its budget allocation for road maintenance was increased to at least $1.6 million \nfor fiscal year 2007, and increased by 20% per annum in each subsequent year of the project; \nand  (iii)  establish,  within  1  year  of  the  grant  effectiveness  date,  a  special  fund  (the  National \nTransport Fund [NTF] or its equivalent) to make these increased allocations available. \n\n9. \nThe  Government\u2019s  revenue  has  been  severely  affected  by  the  global  economic  and \nfinancial  crisis.  While  the  Government  has  provided  for  increases  in  road  maintenance  in  its \nannual budget, in practice it has not disbursed the funds to MID in a timely fashion to meet the \nneeds  of  the  maintenance  program.  MID  has  managed  the  situation  in  the  short  term  by \ndeferring  contract  schedules  and  contractor  payments.  The  NTF  has  been  legally  established \nand  the  Government  has  set  up  a  budget  line  for  NTF  contributions,  but  the  operating \nprocedures have yet to be determined. The NTF is now expected to become operational only in \nlate  2009.  However,  up  to  now,  the  Government  has  satisfactorily  met  its  maintenance \ncommitments. \n\nDespite  the  limitations  on  the  Government\u2019s  counterpart  funds,  the  maintenance \n10. \ncomponents of SIRIP have been performing well. The LBES technique has been well received \nand is usefully generating employment through the establishment of small contracting entities in \nthe provinces of the Solomon Islands. The maintenance contracts are achieving their objectives. \nA change in approach to direct dissemination of the LBES techniques to the contracting industry \nrather  than  through  a  piloting  process  has  saved  time  and  enabled  the  quicker  deployment  of \nLBES techniques. This has been one reason for the increase in AusAID funding.  \n\n \n\n\f36 \n\nAppendix 4 \n\nProgress in the rehabilitation component, which is the largest item and comprises the \n11. \ninternational  competitive  bidding  component  of  SIRIP,  has  been  much  slower  than  originally \nprogrammed. The slowdown is due to a lengthy analytical  process to progressively refine and \nreach  agreement  on  the  multi-criteria  analysis  for  prioritizing  rehabilitation  sections  with  the \nproject steering committee and deciding on priority sections. The first candidate subproject rural \nroad  was  in  Choiseul  Province,  but  it  was  subsequently  included  in  the  Solomon  Islands \nEmergency  Assistance  Project,2  and  there  was  further  delay  in  the  preparation  of  the  Makira \nsubproject \nfeasibility,  economic, \nenvironmental, and social assessments as part of the multi-criteria analysis. The major delays \nwere  attributed  to  the  extended  time  it  took  to  agree  on  the  subproject\u2019s  engineering  option, \nwhich included several risks within the envelope of funds available under SIRIP.  \n\nthat  had  been  eventually  selected \n\nthrough  detailed \n\n12. \n\nThe following is the detailed status of implementation: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\nFeasibility  assessments  for  the  Makira  subproject  for  engineering,  economics, \nenvironmental  and  social  and  poverty  for  72.5  km  of  road  and  25  new  wet \ncrossings  have  been  completed.  Detailed  engineering  designs,  cost  estimates, \nand  bid  documents  are  also  complete.  The  invitation  of  bids  closed  on \n24 July 2009 and the contract is due to be awarded in September 2009. \nThe maintenance of 14 km of roads in Temotu Province using LBES techniques \nhas been completed.  \nSix  road  maintenance contracts  using  LBES  techniques  are  nearing  completion \nand  three  contracts  under  national  competitive  bidding  procedures  are  also  in \nplace.  \nRoad  rehabilitation  and  maintenance  experiences  from  Solomon  Islands, \nneighboring Pacific island countries, Asia, and Africa were presented at an LBES \nworkshop  in  October  2007,  at  which  national  contractors,  community  groups, \nnational  consultants,  staff  of  relevant  government  agencies  and  development \npartners participated. \nNational  contractors  and  various  community  organizations  have  been  trained  in \nLBES techniques and this has avoided the need to pilot-test the LBES program \nof road maintenance activities. \nThe  development  and  establishment  of  an  asset  management  system  is  under \nway  with  systems  for  categorizing  roads  and  collecting  data  on  road  inventory \nand conditions in advanced stages of development. \nA systematic approach to subproject prioritization has been established to draw \nup  annual  works  programs,  including  the  processes  of  economic,  social,  and \nenvironmental \nscreening.  Detailed  engineering  designs,  procurement, \nimplementation, and monitoring procedures are also in place, with MID staff and \nnational consultants undergoing capacity building. \n\n(viii)  A  project  management  and  capacity  building  unit  comprising  international  and \nnational consultants and MID technical support staff is in place. All the consulting \nservices, except for those needed for the construction supervision of the Makira \nand  Guadalcanal  road  rehabilitation  subprojects,  are  in  place  and  are  being \ndelivered.  Additional  consulting  services  have  been  procured  for  (i) contractor \nand  community  education  and  awareness  programs  in  HIV,  and  (ii) contract \nmanagement and/or procurement. \n\n                                                 \n2   ADB.  2007. Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors  on  a  Proposed  Grant  to the \nGovernment  of  Solomon  Islands  for  Proposed  Emergency  Assistance  Project.  Manila.  (Grant  0078-SOL, \ncofinanced with European Commission). \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 4 \n\n37 \n\n(ix) \n\n(x) \n\n(xi) \n\nProcedures  for  contract  performance  monitoring  have  been  established  and \nimplemented,  and  a  committee  comprising  technical  and  engineering  staff  from \nMID has been formed to evaluate bids. \nA  stakeholder  working  group  has  been  established  to  support  the  rollout  of \nlabor-based contracts nationwide across all donor programs. \nNational  consultants  have  been  trained  in  topographic  surveying  for  the \nengineering designs of roads and bridges, including the processing of data and \ninformation using AutoCAD and 12D software. \n\n(xii)  National contractors have been trained in small business management, including \n\ncash management and basic accounting. \n\n(xiii)  A  communications  plan  and  program  has  been \n\ninform \ncommunities  about  crosscutting  issues  in,  and  impact  of,  road  construction \nactivities  (e.g.,  foreign  worker  road  camps,  HIV,  child  protection),  and  also  to \nidentify  and  encourage  local  entrepreneurs  to  be  involved  in  the  business \nopportunities afforded by the use of LBES techniques in maintenance programs. \n\nimplemented \n\nto \n\n(xv) \n\n(xiv)  A  labor-based  working  group  and  asset  management  committee  has  been \nestablished to  coordinate  and  oversee  labor-based  maintenance  programs,  and \nthe development and operation of a robust asset management system.  \nA  detailed  review  of  the  training  and  capacity  development  component  was \nconducted  during  the  midterm  review,  which  was  completed  in  July  2009.  The \nmidterm review concluded that capacity building has been adequately addressed \nin  project  management,  engineering,  social  and  poverty  assessments,  initial \nenvironmental  examination,  community  consultations,  asset  management, \nprocurement,  contract  administration,  topographic  surveys  and  engineering \ndrawings,  monitoring  and  evaluation,  finance  and  administration,  and  national \ncontractor training. \n\n(xvi)  The  Government  has  passed  the  NTF  Act  and  is  preparing  the  implementing \n\nregulations. \n\nE. \n\nLessons from SIRIP \n\nSIRIP  has  introduced  LBES  techniques  for  small-scale  maintenance  contracts  as  a \n13. \nmeans  of  developing  national  small  and  medium-scale  contractor  capacity.  The  decision  to \nbypass the pilot phase proved successful in speeding up implementation. The proposed project \nwill  have  an  opportunity  to  build  on  this  success  by  extending  the  LBES  base  maintenance \nprogram. Because of their success, LBES techniques are being implemented in other externally \nassisted programs and MID\u2019s own recurrent maintenance programs. \n\n14. \nThe  rehabilitation  component  has  made  slow  progress.  The  need  to  substantially \nmodify the  approach from limited rehabilitation of road surfaces to more substantial upgrading \nfocused more on waterway crossings was a result of assumptions about the appropriate level of \nintervention in the initial design of SIRIP, based on limited field data and analysis, which turned \nout to be inappropriate. This reorientation also required individual and joint agreements between \nthe cofinancing partners and the Government, which have taken some time to achieve. A lesson \nfor future projects is the need to acknowledge the risks of designing infrastructure interventions \nwith limited field data, and of relying on untested development assumptions. To obtain congruity \nin  development  partner  financing  for  such  sector  projects,  multi-criteria  evaluation  processes \nand  investment  priorities  need  to  be  progressively  agreed  on  among  stakeholders  and \ncontinuously updated, to achieve the goals of aid coordination set out in the Paris Declaration.3 \n                                                 \n3  Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness, High Level Forum, Paris, March 2005. \n\n \n\n\f38 \n\nAppendix 4 \n\nA  key  lesson  under  SIRIP  is  that  a  more-thorough  and  more-detailed  assessment  under  a \nproject preparatory technical assistance would have significantly eliminated the engineering and \ncost  estimate  issues  that  were  identified  during  the  feasibility  assessment  of  the  Makira \nsubproject after the project was approved.  \n\nF. \n\nRationale for a Second Phase \n\n15. \nThe second-phase project is proposed (i) to expand the scope of rehabilitation beyond \nGuadalcanal  and  Malaita,  (ii)  to  make  permanent  repairs  in  water  crossings  on  Guadalcanal \nWest  Road  damaged  by  the  50-year  flood  of  February  2009,  and  (iii)  to  provide  for  climate \nchange adaptation. The proposal is consistent with the original objectives of SIRIP and supports \nthe Government\u2019s desire for ADB to take the lead in the road subsector and establish a process \nto ensure that aid to the sector is coordinated and more predictable. \n\n16. \nWithout the second phase, the funding shortfall would mean that the Makira subproject \nwould have to be reduced in scope, through a reduction in road length and number of waterway \ncrossings  rehabilitated  or  upgraded  or  in  the  design  standard  of  the  waterway  crossings,  and \nthrough  the  exclusion  of  climate  change  adaptation  from  the  design.  In  either  case,  the \nsubproject  would  not  fully  achieve  its  objective  of  providing  reliable  and  continuous  access  to \nareas with development potential, to give the population better access to social services, and to \nimprove  transport  safety.  Shortening  the  length  of  road  to  be  rehabilitated  or  upgraded  would \nremove  the  highest-return  third  section,  significantly  reducing  the  economic  internal  rate  of \nreturn.  A  compromise  in  design  standards  would  risk  damage  to  the  investment  from  severe \nflood events, and any new livelihood developed as a result of the road improvement would be \nunsustainable. \n\n17. \nA  second  phase  will  also  allow  the  continuing  maintenance  of  the  recent  road \ninvestments made under ADB and  AusAID financing,  before the takeover of this responsibility \nby  the  NTF.  Without  a  second  phase,  a  deferred  maintenance  backlog  would  build  up,  the \ncondition  of  the  roads  would  worsen,  and  it  would  be  more  costly  to  return  the  roads  to  their \ncurrent condition. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 5 \n\n39 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \nAusAID \n \nEED \nEuropean \nCommission \n \n \n \n \n \n \nJapan \n \n \n \n \n\nEXTERNAL ASSISTANCE TO THE ROAD SUBSECTOR, 1990\u20132009 \n \n\nFunding \nAgency \nADB \n \n \n\nLoan/Grant \nor TA No. \n0704 \n1823 \n4494 \n\nProject Description \n\nGuadalcanal Road Improvement Projecta \nPost-Conflict Emergency Rehabilitation Projectb \nInstitutional Strengthening of Ministry of Infrastructure \nand Development \nStrengthening Disaster Recovery Planning and \nCoordination \nRoad Improvement (Sector) Projectc \nEmergency Assistance Projectd \nMataniko and Poha Bridges \nCommunity Sector Project \nSasamunga\u2013Papara Road Rehabilitation Project \nTransport Sector Strategy \nChoiseul Road Improvement Project \nStructural Adjustment Program for MID \nMakira Road Improvement Project \nMalaita Road Maintenance Project \nMalaita Rural Infrastructure Project \nSolomon Islands Rural Transport Project \nCyclone Nina Emergency Rehabilitation Project \nLunnga Bridge  \nMetapono and Alligator Bridges  \nWhite River, Bonege, and Tanaeba Bridges \nCommunity Rural Infrastructure Rehabilitation Project \nLabor-Based Road Maintenance Projecte \nNqalimbiu, Tenaru 1 and Tenaru 2 Bridges \nHoniara Main Road Upgrading Project I \nHoniara Main Road Upgrading Project IIf \nWeathercoast Road Improvement Project \nNoro\u2013Munda Road Rehabilitation Project \nGizo Road Upgrading Project \n\n4944 \n\n0048 \n0078 \nGrant \nGrant \nGrant \nGrant \nGrant \nGrant \nGrant \nGrant \nGrant \nGrant \nGrant \nGrant \nGrant \nGrant \nGrant \nGrant \nGrant \nLoan \nLoan \nGrant \nGrant \nGrant \n  \n\n \nKFAED \nTaipei,China \n \n \nTotal \nADB = Asian Development Bank, AusAID = Australian Agency for International Development, EED = Evangelischer \nEntwicklungsdienst, KFAED = Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic Development, TA = technical assistance. \na   Amount  includes  cofinancing  loans  from  International  Development  Association  of  World  Bank  ($2.0  million), \nOrganization of Petroleum Exporting Countries Fund for International Development ($1.5 million), and Government \nof Solomon Islands ($1.0 million). \n\nb   Amount  includes  cofinancing  grants  from  the  governments  of  Australia  ($2.0  million)  and  New  Zealand \n\n($6.5 million). \n\nc   Amount includes cofinancing grants from governments of Australia ($8.65 million) and New Zealand ($9.75 million). \nd   Amount includes a cofinancing of grants from the European Commission ($4.0 million). \ne   Financed  by  Japan  and  executed  by  the  United  Nations  Development  Programme  via  subcontract  with  the \n\nInternational Labor Organization. \n\nf   Amount  includes  cofinancing  loans  from  Organization  of  Petroleum  Exporting  Countries  Fund  for  International \n\nDevelopment ($1.73 million), and Government of Solomon Islands ($1.20 million). \n\nSource: Ministry of Infrastructure Development, Government of Solomon Islands. \n \n\nAmount  \n($ million) \n\n6.50 \n18.50 \n \n0.70 \n \n0.80 \n18.75 \n4.30 \n2.00 \n9.00 \n0.25 \n0.45 \n0.30 \n0.80 \n0.15 \n0.10 \n7.00 \n4.00 \n1.00 \n5.82 \n6.72 \n7.45 \n0.50 \n0.46 \n8.60 \n7.50 \n9.23 \n0.20 \n0.10 \n0.30 \n95.78 \n\n \n\n\f40 \n\nAppendix 6 \n\nA. \n\nProject Roads \n\nSUBPROJECT ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA \n\nThe Second Road Improvement (Sector) Project will rehabilitate about 20 kilometers of \n1. \nmain and secondary roads and about 30 water crossings (including bridges, culverts, and wet \ncrossings),  representing  a  3-year  time  slice  of  the  rehabilitation  projects  in  the  Government\u2019s \nNational Transport Plan (NTP). The selection of subprojects will be based on agreed eligibility \ncriteria (paras. 3\u20136).  \n\n2. \nThe  roads  to  be  rehabilitated  are  mostly  gravel  and  earthen  roads,  with  a  small \nproportion of sealed roads, which have deteriorated to such an extent that patching, would be \nineffective  and  uneconomical  in  restoring  the  surfaces  and  contours  to  an  acceptable  quality \nand maintainable condition. Such pavements require surface reconstruction and strengthening \nto  handle  future  traffic.  Some  new  surface  sealing  might  be  required  in  areas  of  high  erosion \npotential,  such  as  steep  slopes  and  alongside  flood  plains.  The  water  crossings  will  be \nreconstructed  or  rehabilitated  with  bridges,  culverts,  and  wet  crossings  to  climate-adaptable \nstandards to provide all-weather access and connectivity. The rehabilitation of the subprojects \nwill be subject to site investigation and design criteria, though a range of engineering solutions \nwill  be  considered.  The  rehabilitation  works  might  also  include  minor  upgrading  and  safety \nimprovements. \n\nSubproject Eligibility Criteria  \n\nSubprojects will meet the following general eligibility criteria: \n\nB. \n\n3. \n \n\n(i) \n\nincluding  schools,  health \n\nThe subprojects will upgrade or rehabilitate roads and water crossings assessed \nas  high-development  priorities  on  the  basis  of  their  contribution  to  the \nachievement  of  the  objectives  of  the  Government\u2019s  Medium-Term  Development \nStrategy 2008\u20132010 and prioritized in the NTP, particularly \n(a) \n\nto  social  services  among  poor  and  rural \nfacilities,  and  government \n\nimproved  accessibility \nhouseholds, \nextension services; \nincreased  opportunities  for  employment  and  income  generation  among \npoor and rural households; \npotential  for  increased  private  sector  participation  in  provincial  and \nnational economic activities; \npotential to catalyze development in remote areas with poor access; and  \n(d) \n(e) \ncontribution to poverty reduction among poor and rural households. \nThe subprojects will be selected from the NTP. The NTP has been endorsed by \nthe Government. \n\n(b) \n\n(c) \n\n(ii) \n\n4. \nEach subproject will be economically viable, and shall have demonstrated an economic \ninternal  rate  of  return  acceptable  to  ADB. 1   An  economic  analysis  will  be  conducted  in \naccordance with the Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB\u2019s) Guidelines for the Economic Analysis \n\n                                                 \n1   ADB.  2007.

Para  49(i)  stipulates:  Programs  and  projects  in  weakly \nperforming  countries  should  not  be  expected  to  always  yield  the  same  financial  and  economic  rates  of  return  as \nwould  be  expected  in  stronger-performing  developing  member  countries.  If  ADB  wishes  to  continue  to  provide \ndevelopment assistance to weakly performing countries, it must recognize that the financial and economic risks of \ninvestments are higher and that lower returns are likely. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 6 \n\n41 \n\nof Projects.2 In addition to the standard parameters of road subsector analysis,3 the subproject \nwill be assessed on quantitative grounds for its contribution to \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\npotential  for  increased  agriculture  due  to  lower  freight  costs  and  more  reliable \naccess;  \nemployment  of \nsmall-scale works; and \nincreased incomes, particularly among poor and rural households. \n\nlocal  communities  and  contractors \n\nfor  maintenance  and \n\n5. \nEnvironmental  screening  will  be  conducted  for  all  subprojects.  No  subproject  classified \nas category A in accordance with ADB\u2019s  Environmental Assessment Guidelines (2003) will be \neligible  for  funding  under  the  project.  In  the  selection  of  subproject  sites,  including  extraction \nsites  for  materials  to  be  imported  into  the  road  construction  sites,  the  following  environmental \ncriteria will be used for the first level of screening. If any of these criteria are found applicable to \nthe site, then the subproject will not be accepted as part of the project: \n\n(i)   \n\n(ii) \n(iii)   \n(iv) \n\n(v) \n(vi) \n\nroads in or adjacent to areas classified as ecologically sensitive, and therefore in \ncategory A, requiring the production of an environmental impact assessment; \nrequirement for major realignment of the existing road; \nsignificant loss of natural or primary forest; \nsignificant  loss  or  damage  to  near-shore  marine  environments,  such  as  reefs, \nmangroves, or other sensitive coastal areas; \npermanent negative effect on a known rare or endangered species; and \npermanent damage to irreplaceable cultural relics and archaeological sites. \n\n \n6. \nScreening  for  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  impact  will  be  conducted  for  all \nsubprojects.  No  subproject  that  would  entail  involuntary  resettlement,  according  to  ADB\u2019s \nInvoluntary Resettlement Policy (1995), will be eligible for funding under the project.4 \n\nC. \n\nSubproject Assessment Process \n\n7. \nPotential subprojects are identified and prioritized in the NTP on the basis of high-level \nassessments  of  (i)  existing  networks;  (ii)  the  technical  feasibility  of  providing  access  by \nalternative  modes;  (iii)  positive  and  negative  economic,  social,  and  environmental  impact;  and \n(v) the need for connecting infrastructure (Appendix 3).  \n \nThe  executing  agency,  the  Ministry  of  Infrastructure  Development,  assisted  by  the \n8. \nproject management unit, will conduct and document an assessment of each subproject using \nthe  criteria  described  in  paras.  3\u20136.

Foreign bidders shall \nbe eligible to participate in bidding under the same conditions as national bidders. In particular, \nno  domestic  preference  over  foreign  bidders  shall  be  granted  to  national  bidders  in  bid \nevaluation,  nor  shall  foreign  bidders  be  asked  or  required  to  form  joint  ventures  with  national \nbidders in order to submit a bid. \n\n2. \n\nRegistration \n\n9. \nRegistration shall not be used to assess bidders\u2019 qualifications. A foreign bidder shall not \nbe required to register as a condition for submitting its bid and, if determined to be the lowest \nevaluated  responsive  bidder,  shall  be  given  reasonable  opportunity  of  registering,  without  any \nlet  or  hindrance.  The  registration  process  shall  not  be  applicable  for  subcontractors.  Bidding \nshall not be restricted to any particular class of contractors, and non-classified contractors shall \nalso be eligible to bid. \n\n3. \n\nAdvertising; Time for Bid Preparation \n\n10. \nInvitations  to  bid  shall  be  advertised  in  at  least  one  newspaper  of  national  circulation, \nallowing  a  minimum  of  30  days  for  the  preparation  and  submission  of  bids  except  for \ncommodities and small goods contract. Potential bidders shall be allowed to purchase bidding \ndocuments up to anytime prior to the deadline for submission of bids. \n\n4. \n\nStandard Bidding Documents \n\n11. \n\nStandard bidding documents, acceptable to ADB, shall be used. \n\n5. \n\nQualification Criteria \n\n12. \nQualification criteria shall be clearly specified in the bidding documents, and all criteria \nso  specified,  and  only  such  specified  criteria,  shall  be  used  to  determine  whether  a  bidder  is \nqualified. Qualification shall be assessed on a pass or fail basis and merits points shall not be \nused.  Such  assessment  shall  only  take  into  account  the  bidder\u2019s  capacity  and  resources  to \nperform  the  contract,  specifically  its  experience  and  past  performance  on  similar  contracts, \ncapabilities with respect to personnel, equipment and construction and manufacturing facilities, \nand  financial  capacity.  The  evaluation  of  the  bidder\u2019s  qualifications  shall  be  conducted \nseparately from the technical and commercial evaluation of the bid. \n\n                                                 \n1 Government of Solomon Islands. 2004.

Bids \nshall be opened in public, immediately after the deadline for submission of bids. Bids received \nafter the deadline for bid submission shall be rejected and returned to the bidders unopened. All \nbidding for goods and works shall be carried out through a one envelope procedure. Evaluation \nof  bids  shall  be  made  in  strict  adherence  to  the  criteria  that  shall  be  clearly  specified  in  the \nbidding  documents  and  quantified  in  monetary  terms  for  evaluation  criteria  other  than  price; \nmerit points shall not be used in bid evaluation. A contract shall be awarded to the technically \nresponsive  bid  that  offers  the  lowest  evaluated  price  and  no  negotiations  shall  be  permitted. \nBidders shall not be eliminated from detailed evaluation on the basis of minor, non-substantial \ndeviations.  No  bidder  shall  be  rejected  on  the  basis  of  a  comparison  with  the  employer\u2019s \nestimate and budget ceiling without the Association\u2019s prior concurrence. A copy of the minutes \nof the public bid opening shall be promptly provided to all bidders, and to the Association with \nrespect to contracts subject to prior review. \n\n7. \n\nRejection of All Bids and Re-bidding \n\nNeither  shall  all  bids  be  rejected  nor  new  bids  solicited  without  ADB\u2019s  prior  written \n\n14. \nconcurrence. \n\n8. \n\nExtension of the Validity of Bids \n\n15. \nExtension of validity of bids may be allowed in exceptional circumstances but there shall \nbe no amendment of the price or any other condition of the bids. Bidders may refuse such an \nextension without forfeiting their bid securities, but bidders granting an extension shall provide \nextension of the validity of their bid securities. \n\n9. \n\nComplaints by Bidders and Handling of Complaints \n\nThe  recipient  shall  establish  and  implement  an  effective  and  independent  protest \n\n16. \nmechanism allowing bidders to protest and to have their protests handled in a timely manner. \n\n10. \n\nFraud and Corruption \n\n17. \nADB shall declare a firm or individual ineligible, either indefinitely or for a stated period, \nto  be  awarded  a  contract  financed  by  the  ADB,  if  it  at  any  time  determines  that  the  firm  or \nindividual has, directly or through an agent, engaged in corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, coercive or \nobstructive practices in competing for, or in executing, a contract financed by the ADB. \n\n11. \n\nRight to Inspect/Audit \n\n18. \nEach  bidding  document  and  contract  financed  from  the  proceeds  of  a  financing  shall \ninclude  a  provision  requiring  bidders,  suppliers,  contractors  and  subcontractors  to  permit  the \nADB  at  its  request,  to  inspect  their  accounts  and  records  relating  to  the  bid  submission  and \nperformance  of  the  contract  and  to  have  said  accounts  and  records  audited  by  auditors \nappointed by the ADB. The deliberate and material violation by the bidder, supplier, contractor \nor subcontractor of such provision may amount to obstructive practice. \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 10 \n\n50 \n \n\nA. \n\nIntroduction \n\nOUTLINE TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR CONSULTANTS \n\nfor \n\nthe  Second  Road \n\nThe consultants engaged under the existing project management and capacity building \n1. \nunit  provide  day-to-day  project  management  of  the  Solomon  Islands  Road  Improvement \n(Sector)  Project  (SIRIP).1  Additional  consulting  services  will  be  financed  under  the  proposed \ngrant  to  support  further  project  management,  engineering  design,  project  administration,  and \nImprovement  (Sector)  Project.  The \nimplementation  supervision \nconsultancy services will focus on three subprojects for road rehabilitation: (i) rehabilitation of a \ncoastal  road  on  the  island  of  Makira,  about  72.5  kilometers  (km)  of  the  provincial  capital, \nKirakira, with 25 wet crossings; (ii) rehabilitation of flood damage on the island of Guadalcanal \nfrom  Poha  River  to  Naro  Hill,  about  29  km  of  road  and  11  bridges;  and  (iii)  the  Malaita \nsubproject consisting of the realignment of about 8 km of road and construction. In addition to \nthe rehabilitation, the project will support consulting services for the maintenance of roads and \nbridges in the subproject areas. The road maintenance will include community contracting using \nlabor-based, equipment-supported (LBES) techniques.

Link to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \n\nThe Solomon Islands is one of the most disadvantaged Pacific developing member countries. Hardship has been exacerbated \nby  tension  and  conflict,  the  ensuing  law  and  order  problems,  financial  crisis,  a  contracting  economy,  rising  unemployment, \nand the high population growth rates. Many Solomon Islanders have been displaced by the conflict. \nUnder  the  poverty  partnership  agreement,  signed  between  ADB  and  Solomon  Islands  in  2003,  programs,  projects  and \nactivities  funded  by  ADB  will  draw  on  the  National  Economic  Recovery,  Reform  and  Development  Plan  for  2003\u20132006  to \nstrengthen the focus on reducing hardship.  \n \n\nB.  Poverty Analysis                                 Targeting Classification: General Intervention (GI) \n\n1. Key Issues  \nProject.  According  to  analysis  of  the  Household  Income  and  Expenditure  Survey  2005/06  (HIES)  data  undertaken  by  the \nUnited Nations Development  Programme, poverty  in the Solomon Islands context does  not mean hunger or  destitution, but \nrather  the  struggle  to  meet  daily  or  weekly  living  expenses,  particularly  those  that  require  cash  payments.  The  definition \nfurther  included  (i)  households  constantly  having  to  make  choices  between  competing  demands  for  household  expenditure \nand the limited availability of cash income to meet that expenditure; (ii) households having to make trade-offs between one bill \nand another, food or school fees, utilities or bus fares; (iii) households borrowing regularly from loan sharks, who charge very \nhigh  interest  rates,  for  small  unsecured  loans  to  meet  family  commitments  and  community  obligations;  and  (iv)  households \nthat are frequently or constantly in debt. Households deemed to be experiencing basic needs poverty therefore face hardship \ndaily.  They  struggle  to  pay  bills  and  purchase  adequate  and  suitably  nutritious  food.  According to  the  estimation  of  poverty \nlines, the HIES showed that the average national incidence of basic needs poverty was 18.8% of households and 22.7% of \nthe population, and for rural areas the rate of basic needs poverty was equivalent to 15.2% of households and 18.8% of the \npopulation. Rapid rural appraisal (RRA) results showed that poor households are those with insufficient cash income to buy \ngoods  in  everyday  use,  considered  as  necessities  that  cannot  be  produced  by  the  household  (kerosene,  clothes,  soap, \nmedicine,  matches,  cooking  pots,  tea,  and  sugar),  while  \u201chardship\u201d  families  are  those  households  that  cannot  afford  to \n(i) consume  occasional  \u201cluxuries\u201d  (mainly  imported  processed  foods  consumed  by  choice)  such  as  rice,  tinned  fish,  tinned \nmeat, cabin biscuits, tinned or powdered milk, noodles, flour; (ii) contribute to school fees or make cash donations to church \nand  ceremonial  activities;  (iii)  improve  the  quality  of  their  houses  (with  corrugated-iron  roofs  and  rainwater  catchments  for \nexample); and (iv) pay fares for occasional transport to the commercial and service center.  \nMakira subproject. Makira is the most disadvantaged province. The province had 9.9% of all rural households and 10.8% of \nthe total rural population, but accounted for 15.3% of rural poor households and 16.4% of the total rural poor population. The \nsubproject  area  adjacent  has  high  economic  potential  for  smallholder  cocoa  production  and  timber  milling,  and  many \nhouseholds earn cash from agricultural products sold at the provincial town market and to commercial buyers for export. The \nmajor sources of income in Makira households (56%) include the sale of garden products, commercial crops such as copra \nand  cocoa,  logging  and  sawmill  activities,  and  small,  home-based  businesses  like  bakeries,  shops,  or  kerosene  depots. \nHowever,  it  is  likely  that  most  households  experience  hardship.  The  HIES  shows  average  and  median  annual  household \nexpenditure  is  much  lower  for  Makira-Ulawa  than  for  the  country  as  a  whole,  as  it  is  for  average  and  median  per  capita \nexpenditure  being  close  to  the  dollar-per-day  poverty  line  measure.  Housing  has  also  been  used  as  a  relative  poverty \nindicator  because  those  who  are  more  economically  disadvantaged  than  others  cannot  normally  afford  to  improve  their \nstandard  of  housing  (improved  houses  are  widely  aspired  to  throughout  Solomon  Islands).  A  much-higher  proportion  of \nhouses  in  Makira  are  built  of  traditional  materials,  while  few  houses  have  rainwater  tanks,  indicating  that  very  few  houses \nhave  corrugated-iron  roofs.  In  the  RRA  sample  villages,  except  for  the  prosperous  village  of  Kaonasugu,  less  than  30%  of \nhouses had iron roofs and fewer had rainwater tanks. From the data provided during the road user survey, overall some 5% of \nhouseholds  fall  below  the  food  poverty  level  (FPL)  and  11%  fall  below  the  basic  needs  poverty  level  (BNPL)  based  on \npotential weekly income, while 11% fall below the FPL and 21% fall below the BNPL based on average actual weekly income. \nGuadalcanal subproject. Nearly 50% of road users are from households that fall below the BNPL and 41% of road users are \nfrom  households  that  fall  below  the  FPL  based  on  actual  income.  Repairing  and  reinstating  the  road  will  ensure  access  to \nHoniara and key facilities and services along the main road (schools and health posts). Following rehabilitation of the road, \naccess for people living along the Weather Coast, as well as the performance of a key route in the island transport network\u2014\n\n \n\n\fAppendix 12 \n\n61 \n\nWest  Road\u2014will  improve.  This  will  facilitate  the  flow  of  traffic,  goods,  and  passengers  both  internally  (along  the  Weather \nCoast and through the subproject area to the market in Honiara). Communities and service providers require access. During \nthe  RRA  for  this  subproject,  and  the  Lambi\u2013Naro  Hill  subproject  feasibility  study  in  2008,  improving  access  as  a  means  to \nincreasing household incomes was a direct correlation made by villagers during the community meetings. \n \n2. Design Features  \n \nMakira  subproject.  The subproject will construct safer and more reliable river and stream crossings along the road east of \nKirkira  to  the  Warhito  River  and  west  of  Kirkira  to  the  Wianuri  River.  Providing  or  restoring  river  crossings  will  create \nincentives for cheaper transportation services access to markets and to cocoa, copra, and timber buyers. This will increase \nhousehold  incomes  and  was  stated  as  a  priority  for  development  in  the  communities  consulted.  Better  and  more-durable \ncrossing will provide villagers with easier and safer access to social services on the road and in Kirakira. \nGuadalcanal  subproject.  Rehabilitation  and  upgrading  of  waterway  crossing  on  the  main  road  on  Guadalcanal  has  been \nincluded  in  the  project  following  record  rains  and  flooding  in  late  January  2009,  rated  as  a  50-year  event.  Some  13  people \nwere killed during the flooding, which is estimated to have directly affected some 9,000 people and indirectly affected a further \n30,000,  and  destroyed  about  96%  of  food  gardens  and  5%  of  homes  on  Guadalcanal  Island,  Malaita,  Makira,  and  Central \nprovinces. Extensive damage to roads, bridges, causeways, and fords resulted in severance at a number of locations, cutting \noff road access to the western part of the island (the Weather Coast). Immediate repair and temporary works were undertaken \nto facilitate movement of traffic, and assist with flood relief and assistance activities; however, permanent works are required \nalong the road and at damaged bridges and culverts to provide for safe and reliable connectivity to Honiara for communities \nliving along the road and on the Weather Coast. \n \n\nII. \n\nSOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\nFindings of Social Analysis  \n \nMakira subproject. About 45% of the population in the vicinity of the subproject road west of Kirarkira town is cut off from the \nprovincial  center  during  frequent  flooding  by  the  Waita\u2019a  river.  Water  damage  to  vehicles  deters  the  private  sector  from \nproviding  regular  passenger  and  goods  transportation  services  on  the  road  and  passengers  and  cargo  carriers  rely  on \nirregular  and  expensive  sea  transport,  hiring  or  paying  fares  to  travel  on  small  outboard  motor-powered  craft.  Their  limited \naccess to Kirakira town, where secondary schools, hospital, shops, market, wharf, airfield, and commodity buyers are located, \nplaces them at a disadvantage. People reported that life is hard because they cannot make enough  money to meet school \nfees, or improve the quality of their houses (with corrugated-iron roofs and rainwater catchments, for example). Among other \nhardships  people  reportedly  face  is  expensive  sea  transport  to  services  available  only  in  town.  This  is  true  especially  for \npeople  on  the  west  side  of  Wairaha  River.  Hardship  is  also  described  as  extreme  difficulty  in  quickly  transporting  medical \nemergency cases to hospital. Hence, the great concern of the people is the provision of safe road transport so that everyone \ncan have access to such services.   \n \nGuadalcanal subproject. In terms of access, Guadalcanal can be divided into four regions: east, west, north, and south. In \nterms of nearness to the main urban center of Honiara, the north, northeast, northwest, and to some extent the eastern and \nwestern areas have comparatively better access to the city than the south, southeast, and southwest regions. Although the \nsouthern  region  is  only  a  short,  direct,  distance  from  the  northern  part  of  the  island,  the  impassable  terrain  combined  with \ninadequate  shipping  services  and  the  lack  of  roads  are  key  constraints  on  the  commercial  development  of  the  area. \nProducers  from  this  area  cannot  sell  surplus  goods  at  the  central  market  in  Honiara.  The  physical  differences  between  the \nWeather Coast and the rest of the island translate into large differences in villagers\u2019 welfare, physical infrastructure (including \nroads),  health  and  education  services,  and  potential  for  improvement.  The  ethnic  tensions  that  affected  Solomon  Islands \nbetween 1999 and 2003 have had a profound impact on many people in Guadalcanal. Many people on the Weather Coast \nfled  the  fighting  and  moved  inland  or  closer  to  Honiara.  About  12,800  people  in  Guadalcanal  were  displaced  during  the \ntensions.  Security  was  restored  by  the  RAMSI  force  from  July  2003  onward,  but  the  economic,  social,  and  demographic \nimpact continues in all parts of the province. As a result, Guadalcanal Province is considered to be about 10 years behind in \nterms of socioeconomic development. \nGuadalcanal  people  live  on  customary  clan  (sometimes  referred  to  as  \u201cline\u201d)  land.  Traditionally,  Guadalcanal  societies  are \nmatrilineal:  land  and  property  are  inherited  from  the  mother  and  the  mother\u2019s  family.  It  is  traditional  practice  for  a  male \nmarrying into a line or clan to have rights to use the maternal clan land. While a male member of a clan marrying a woman \nfrom another clan has the right to bring his wife to live on his clan\u2019s land, the wife and children will not have landowning rights \non the clan land.  \nEighteen  different,  but  related,  languages  are  spoken  on  Guadalcanal.  The  languages  are  structurally  dialects  of  the  one \nprototype  Guadalcanal  language,  and  it  is  relatively  easy  for  people  from  one  language  group  to  understand  and  talk  to \npeople  from  other  groups  using  their  own  dialect.  People  speaking  different  languages  or  dialects  technically  belong  to \ndifferent clans or lines. \n\n \n\n\f62 \n \n\nAppendix 12 \n\nThe  economy  of  the  subproject  area  is  largely  dependent  on  cocoa  and  copra  production.  Most  households  have  small \ngardens or shared garden plots. The main crops grown include cassava, kumara, taro, pana, and cocoa. Teak, sago palms, \nbetel nut, cut-nut, pawpaw, and bananas are also grown in the area. Most working-age adults are engaged in agriculture and \nlivestock,  with  a  slightly  higher  proportion  of  females  (60%)  compared  with  males  (52%)  in  this  livelihood  activity.  Fishing \n(2%), forestry (0.4%), and mining or quarrying and construction (10%) are the only livelihood activities of males. Some 25% of \nfemales, compared with 19% of males, are in public administration or the health and education sector.  \nA  small  proportion  of  households  (3%)  in  the  subproject  run  small  canteens,  and  29%  (between  4%  and  100%  of  all \nhouseholds in two villages) are involved in producing cooked or baked food for sale. Overall, some 9% are involved in fishing, \nwith two villages\u2014Naro (44%) and Maravovo (34%)\u2014accounting for much-greater proportions of households than the other \nvillages. All households in Vura, Maravovo, Gurumai, and Tuvu produce cocoa, copra, garden crops, and betel nut.  \nThe primary beneficiaries of the project are the people who live in the wider catchment area of the subproject road. According \nto  the  1999  census  population,  adjusted  for  growth,  the  population  directly  along  the  subproject  road  is  7,782  (using \nenumeration areas for Sahulu and Tandai wards from the census). An additional 21,160 people who live between Lambi and \nWanderer  Bay  and  along  the  Weather  Coast  (southern  coast)  also  rely  on  access  by  means  of  the  subproject  road.  The \npopulation considered to be served by this section of the main road is 28,942.  \nMore specifically, the population served includes the following groups of road users:  (i) existing road  users, be they vehicle \ndrivers, passengers, or users of nonmotorized transport; (ii) households living in villages along, and in the catchment area of, \nthe main road who grow or sell a range of cash crops including copra and cocoa; (iii) passenger and goods (cargo) transport \nservice providers and commercial truck drivers; (iv) schoolchildren and teachers at the  schools and major facility  at Selwyn \nCollege; and (v) small businesses and traders including vendors at local or informal markets, trade store owners, and produce \nbuyers.  Provincial  authorities  and  key  social  service  providers  such  as  those  in  the  education  and  health  sector  will  also \nbenefit from the reinstatement of the road.   \n \n\nB.  Consultation and Participation \n\n1. Provide a summary of the consultation and participation process during the project preparation. \n\nProject:  A  participation  strategy  was  developed  for  SIRIP  and  all  subprojects  following  initial  RRA,  IPSA  and/or  IEE \nconsultations  with  stakeholders.  The  strategy  includes  participatory  community-based  activities  before  construction  to  raise \nawareness  of  the  risks,  and  participation  in  labor-based,  equipment-supported  (LBES)  construction  and  maintenance \nactivities. The program will be organized and coordinated by the SIRIP community development specialist.  \nMakira  subproject.  Consultation  meetings  were  held  in  August  2007  at  14  places  along  the  subproject  road,  with \n424 participants from 41 villages. The meetings  were open in that anybody  with an interest in the subproject  was invited to \nparticipate; for smaller villages, a group of villages was invited to attend a meeting.  \nGuadalcanal  subproject.  Consultation  included  key  informant  interviews  with  village  and  church  leaders,  RRA  with \n103 participants, a road user survey, and discussions with village leaders. A survey of road users at several locations along \nthe subproject road was completed in March and April 2009.  \n \n2. What level of consultation and participation (C&P) is envisaged during the project implementation and monitoring?  \n\n Information sharing   \n\n Consultation   \n\n Collaborative decision making  \n\n Empowerment \n\n No  \n\n Yes  \n\n \n3. Was a C&P plan prepared? \nA communications plan for the Project has been prepared. \nRisks  will  be  addressed  through  (i)  measures  to  prevent  conflicts  between  local  people  and  contractors;  (ii)  road  safety \neducation  by  the  provincial  police  and  local  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs);  and  (iii)  HIV  awareness  campaigns  in \nvillages  with  the  involvement  of  a  specialized  NGO  and  the  provincial  Department  of  Health.  There  will  also  be \nawareness raising to maximize benefits from the subproject. All awareness activities will involve local and international NGOs \nworking in the province, and provincial government agencies.  \nA stakeholder analysis is included in this report. The primary stakeholders are members of communities in the subproject area \nwho, assuming the private sector provides transport services on the rehabilitated road, will benefit from (i) improved access to \nmarkets; (ii) improved access to health services; (iii) increased incentives to produce copra as transport to markets improve; \n(iv) increased  incomes  from  produce  and  cash  crop  marketing,  allowing  families  to  invest  in  better  housing  and  rainwater \ncatchments;  (v)  improved  public  health  status;  and  (vi)  more-profitable  small  household  retail  businesses  as  local  incomes \nrise.  \nOther stakeholders who will benefit are transport, provincial health and education and agricultural extension service providers, \nand merchants supplying goods to and buying cocoa, copra, and sawn timber from the subproject area. \n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 12 \n\n63 \n\nC. Gender and Development \n\nKey Issues.  \nGeneral.  There  is  a  fairly  clear  division  of  labor  between  men  and  women,  with  women  working  longer  hours  than  men  at \nroutine tasks to maintain their households. Women are primarily responsible for food crops and men for cash crops (however, \nwomen contribute labor to activities such as copra drying and cocoa harvesting). Women interviewed said that the restoration \nof transport services on the road would reduce their burden of carrying garden produce and increase their incomes by giving \nthem access to the town market. \nThe major differences between women\u2019s and men\u2019s travel patterns are grounded in the gender-based division of labor and the \nlocation  in  which  this  work  is  undertaken.  The  focus  of  women\u2019s  daily  activities  and,  therefore,  movements  is  typically  the \nhomestead.  Women  tend  to  take  shorter,  more  frequent,  and  more  dispersed  trips  during  the  day  to  fetch  water,  collect \nfirewood, raise livestock, and undertake cocoa and/or copra production.  \nGender  also  plays  a  role  in  determining  the  incidence  of  poverty  in  Solomon  Islands.  The  HIES  analysis  suggests  that \nhouseholds headed by women are slightly overrepresented in the lowest three expenditure deciles. In rural areas, households \nheaded  by  women  are  particularly  overrepresented  in  the  lowest  quintile  (20%)  of  households,  suggesting  that  these \nhouseholds  are  among  the  poorest  in  these  areas.  After  controlling  for  household  size  and  gender  of  household  head \n(populations  of  households  headed  by  men  and  women),  a  different  picture  emerges,  with  households  headed  by  women \nearning significantly more actual income (SI$653.13 per week) and potential income (SI$1,898.92 per week) than households \nheaded  by  men  (SI$136.97  per  week  [actual]  and  SI$429.28  per  week  [potential]).  The  survey  data  show  that  a  higher \nproportion  of  women  road  users  are  from  households  falling  below  the  poverty  lines  for  both  potential  and  average  actual \nweekly incomes.  \nThe main gender impact of the subprojects is as follows: (i) the gender-biased nature of transport in the project area and the \ndifferential  impact  of  failing  infrastructure  between  the  genders;  (ii)  women\u2019s  participation  in  LBES  construction  and \nmaintenance;  (iii)  the  gender  impact  of  LBES  road  construction  methods;  and  (iv)  the  role  of  women  contractors  and  the \nbarriers they face in responding to the implementation of a gender-equitable LBES road maintenance program. \nParticipation  in  LBES  activities  provides  an  income-generating  opportunity  presented  by  employment  in  road  maintenance. \nParticipation  in  roadworks  gives  both  women  and  men  a  chance  to  have  cash.  Access  to  cash  would  give  women  an \nopportunity  to  acquire  productive  assets  and  could  contribute  to  their  economic  empowerment.  With  improved  household \nincome,  there  is  likely  to  be  improved  household  welfare,  and  the  possibility  that  households  may  move  above  the  poverty \nline. Overall, the community will benefit from the increased purchasing power of the workers. With better access as a result of \nimproved infrastructure, farm-gate prices may improve and commodity prices reduce.  \nAny participation will need to be balanced with the usual (paid and nonpaid) workload of women and men. Women are more \nlikely  to  be  disproportionately  affected  since,  in  addition  to  providing  LBES,  they  will  continue  doing  household  chores  and \nother unpaid work. This means that they will experience even more fragmented use of their time and have less time for leisure \nand rest. \nA  number  of  positive  actions  are  recommended  for  implementation  in  project  design:  (i)  identify  and  remove  any  potential \ngender  bias  within  the  local  procurement  processes;  (ii)  prequalify  contractors  including  women  or  award  extra  points \nproportionate  to  the  participation  of  women;  (iii)  provide  training  and  information  on  contracting  systems,  procedures,  and \nprocesses  (the  training  should  address  gender  issues  including  greater  focus  on  gender-balanced  community  participation, \nenabling an understanding of the gender impact of failing infrastructure, and of the noneconomic benefits of investment); (iv) \nprovide for more flexibility in the criteria for the selection of enterprises to be trained as small and medium-sized rehabilitation \ncontractors,  thus  removing  the  present  bias  toward  firms  led  by  technically  qualified  male  degree  holders  and  enabling  the \ndevelopment  of  women-owned  construction  enterprises;  (v)  identify  means  (such  as  microfinance  or  revolving  credit \nschemes) to overcome other possible barriers such as difficulty in securing the start-up capital that a small-scale contractor \nneeds  to  purchase  equipment  and  tools  and  to  provide  flexibility  with  cash  flow  (especially  before  the  payment  of  the  first \ninvoice); (vi) require contractors to ensure that women make up at least a third of their labor force (attaining this proportion will \nmean that the contractor must proactively invite women to sign up for construction activities rather than recruit only those who \nshow interest, and also select women to be forepersons); (vii) require contractors to use task-based instead of daily rates, to \nadopt  flexible  working  times,  and  to  provide  women  with  separate  and  special  facilities  to  promote  their  participation;  (viii) \nrequire  contractors  not  to  allocate  women  traditional  tasks  or  to  allocate  tasks  along  existing  gender  divisions  of  labor;  (ix) \nrequire contractors to use alternative recruitment criteria (other than physical fitness), and not to schedule interviews on fixed \ndates, which can deter women\u2019s participation; (x) require contractors to recruit a new workforce at regular intervals (such as \nevery  5  km)  to  spread  work  opportunities  and  ensure  that  women  are  not  discouraged  by  excessive  distances  to  the \nworkplace;  (xi)  require  equal  pay  for  equal  work  for  both  men  and  women;  and  (xii) require  contractors  to  submit  weekly \nrecords of daily labor, disaggregated by gender. \nMakira  subproject.  The  road  user  survey  showed  that  some  69%  of  travel  undertaken  by  women  is  associated  with \nlivelihood activities and 31% related to social or customary activities, while of all men\u2019s trips, nearly three-quarters (73%) are \nassociated with livelihood and productive activities and 27% of  trips are social or customary. Of all the trips associated with \nlivelihood and productive activities, 58% are made by men and 47% are made by women, while of all trips related to social or \n\n \n\n\f64 \n \n\nAppendix 12 \n\ncustomary activities, some 51% are made by women and 53% are made by men. Collection of copra, cocoa, or other crop, \nbetel nut, or fish accounts for the largest proportion of all men\u2019s trips (26%) and women\u2019s trips (24%), followed by trips to the \nmarket or for shopping (20% of women\u2019s trips and 18% of men\u2019s trips). Trips for water collection account for 3% of women\u2019s \ntrips and 2% of men\u2019s trips. Over three-quarters (84%) of all trips made in the subproject area are done on foot; trips by truck \naccount for 9% of travel (10% of trips made by women and 8% of trips made by men) while canoe or boat travel account for \n7% of trips (6% of women\u2019s trips and 7% of men\u2019s trips). Only male road users stated they also use bicycles (2%). For trips \nthat are made on foot, many involve carrying loads (equipment, goods for sale, or goods purchased) on the head or the back, \npossibly  increasing  travel  time.  This  travel  burden  coupled  with  the  work  burden  means  that  women\u2019s  labor  is  not  easily \ntransferable.  \nGuadalcanal  Subproject: The results of the road survey show that, overall, 71% of trips are associated with livelihood and \nproductive activities and 21% are related to social and customary activities. The remaining 8% of trips are classified as \u201cother\u201d \nand  cannot  be  easily  identified  as  falling  into  one  or  other  of  the  foregoing  categories.  Some  69%  of  travel  undertaken  by \nwomen  is  associated  with  livelihood  activities  and  23%  is  related  to  social  or  customary  activities.  Of all  men\u2019s  trips,  nearly \nthree-quarters  (72%)  are  associated  with  livelihood  and  productive  activities  and  20%  are  social  or  customary.  A  high \nproportion of trips associated with the outputs of livelihood and productive activities are made by truck (89% of trips of people \ngoing to the market or selling goods, and 84% of trips made by people collecting copra, fish, and other crops), and 7% of trips \nfor other work are also made by truck. For trips for social reasons, 77% are made to visit family or friends, and 16% of trips to \nhealth facilities are made by truck. Trips for gardening or tending the plantation are nearly all made on foot (97%), and 27% of \nother work-related trips are also made on foot. \nTravel times do not vary much according to the gender of the road user. Trips of less than half an hour account for 42% of all \ntrips made by women and 35% of all trips made by men. The travel times that account for the next-largest proportion of trips \nby gender are trips of between 1 and 2 hours for women (26%) and trips of between 2 and 4 hours for men (26%). Twice as \nmany  men  make  trips  of  between  half  an  hour  and  an  hour.  In  terms  of  distances  traveled,  most  trips  made\u201469%  of  trips \noverall (62% of women\u2019s trips and 73% of men\u2019s trips)  \u2014are less than 0.5 km. Trips of 1\u20132 km account for 21% of all trips, \n27% of trips by  women, and 17% of trips made by men. Women (10%) more than men (6%) make trips of 3\u20135 km. Longer \ntrips of at least 6 km account for 3% of trips, and are undertaken by men more frequently than women.  \nTrips associated with gardening or plantation work account for 14% of men\u2019s trips and 9% of women\u2019s trips. Collection of fruits \nand/or vegetables and shells also account for the largest proportion of women\u2019s trips (42%) followed by trips to the market or \nfor shopping (16%) and trips to health facilities (14%), while travel associated with other work accounts for a small proportion \n(1%) of all trips made by women. \nTrips  on  foot  account  for  36%  of  all  trips  (37%  of  trips  made  by  women  and  29%  of  trips  made  by  men),  while  bus  travel \naccounts for 6% of trips overall (11% of women\u2019s trips and 9% of men\u2019s trips) and canoe or boat travel account for 2% of trips \n(1% of women\u2019s trips and 5% of men\u2019s trips). For trips that are made on foot, many involve carrying loads (either equipment, \ngoods for sale, or goods purchased) on the head or the back, possibly increasing travel time. This travel burden coupled with \nthe work burden means that women\u2019s labor is not easily transferable.   \nThe  selling  of  copra,  cocoa,  or  other  crops,  betel  nut,  or  fish  accounts  for  the  largest  proportion  of  all  men\u2019s  trips  (19%) \nfollowed by collection of same (16%). Over half (56%) of all trips made in the subproject area are done on foot, accounting for \n59%  of  trips  made  by  women  and  54%  of  trips  made  by  men.  A  smaller  proportion  of  women  travel  by  either  truck  (31%) \ncompared with men (36%), or by canoe (8%) compared with men (11%).  \nIn Guadalcanal, educational achievement varies according to gender. Twice as many women (9%) compared with men (4%) \nhave no education, slightly more men (26%) than women (24%) have a primary education, and twice as many men (4%) as \nwomen (2%) have graduated in secondary education from Year 11 to Year 13.  \n \n2.
