THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan of \nup to $93,750,000 to Olam International Limited (OIL) and to Olam Treasury Private Limited \n(OTPL) in United States dollars for the Olam COVID-19 Smallholder Farmer Livelihood Support \nProject in Viet Nam, Indonesia, and Papua New Guinea (PNG).1 \n \n2.  The project will support smallholder farmers from whom OIL and its subsidiaries (Olam) \ndirectly source raw materials in the project countries. Disruptions to agricultural supply chains \ncaused by the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic have impacted smallholder farmers as \nlocal markets close down and smaller traders cease buying. The impact of COVID-19 on \nlivelihoods of female farmers is disproportionately harsh, given their limited access to land, credit, \nand inputs. Olam\u2019s role as a sustainable buyer of agricultural products at scale will provide timely \nsupport to smallholder farmers\u2019 livelihoods, particularly for female farmers. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Project Identification and Description \n \n1.  Project Identification \n \n3.  COVID-19 impact on smallholder farmers. Smallholder farmers in Asia and the Pacific \nare facing a disproportionate impact on their livelihoods because of the COVID-19 pandemic and \nthe ensuing economic slowdown.2 Smallholder farmers are experiencing a  decline in their \npurchasing power, increasing amounts of food loss, falling prices, and other disturbances \ncaused mainly by the disruption of agricultural supply chains. With low average incomes even \nbefore the pandemic, smallholder farmers are now enduring worsening conditions. Local \nagricultural supply chain disruptions coupled with economic contraction stemming from COVID-\n19 have drastically reduced farmers\u2019 sales volumes and prices because of market closures and \nthe shrinking number of and demand from traders. Prolonged lockdowns could worsen the \nfinancial burden of farmers as loan payment due dates approach, payments are missed, or loans \ngrow. The impact will be most severe on smallholder farmers with little savings from harvests and \nreturns from earlier sales.3 \n \n4.  Agriculture key to fight poverty during the pandemic. Extreme poverty remains a \nlargely rural phenomenon, with two-thirds of the global extremely poor living in rural areas.4 \nCOVID-19 could push 34 million more people into extreme poverty by the end of 2020 and an \nadditional 130 million by 2030.5 More than half of the extremely poor are in Asia and the Pacific, \nwhere  agriculture  is  characterized  by  unorganized,  small-scale  farming.6 Most  smallholder \nfarmers are not included in formal value chains and face challenges that include lack of access \nto finance and quality inputs, low yields, lack of storage and market infrastructure, limited local \n \n1  In descending order of proportion of total project size. \n2  Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO). 2020.

As most of the rural poor are smallholder \nfarmers,7 supporting agriculture is critical to avoid increased poverty levels. \n \n5.  Viet Nam. Agriculture has made significant progress, but smallholder farmers have been \nleft behind. Agriculture contributes about 14% of gross domestic product (GDP) and employs 37% \nof the labor force. Yet, in the Central Highlands, one of the main agricultural regions, where 71% \nof  the  population  are  smallholder  farmers,  the  poverty  rate  is  22%\u2014more  than  twice  the \nnationwide rate.8 The difficulties that smallholder farmers in the Central Highlands are facing \nbecause of droughts since early 2020 (e.g., extremely low water levels in rivers) have been \nexacerbated by supply chain disruptions stemming from the pandemic. Gender inequalities in \nagriculture, food, and nutrition security are visible in women\u2019s disproportionate levels of unpaid \nlabor and their lack of access to resources (e.g., land, finance, technology, training, and markets) \nand agricultural extension services.9 \n \n6.  Indonesia. Most food crop producers are landless or cultivate small landholdings. The \nfarmers earn low incomes and fall into and out of poverty, contributing to the rural poverty rate of \n14%, which is significantly higher than the 8% urban poverty rate. In the second quarter of 2020, \nGDP contracted by 5.3% year-on-year and the poverty rate is projected to increase from 9.5% in \n2019  to  10.7%\u201311.6%  in  2020.10 Diminishing  demand  from  coffee  retail  outlets  in  Java, \ncompounded by supply chain disruptions because of the pandemic, has eroded the income of \ncocoa and coffee farmers, leaving them vulnerable to food insecurity.11 Women are involved in all \nagricultural activities. However, despite serving as the backbone of one of the most economically \nimportant sectors, women in agriculture are marginalized and often have little access to financial \nresources, knowledge, and technology to improve their crop yields and livelihoods (footnote 11). \n \n7.  Papua New Guinea. Most smallholder farmers are poor. Most farming households can \nbe characterized as low-input, low-output producers. Of people living in rural areas, 91% are \npoor.12 Agriculture accounts for one-third of GDP, with 75% of the population relying on agriculture \nfor their main livelihood. Half the population rely on coffee and cocoa as the main cash crops. The \npandemic  has  compounded  the  stress  in  food  systems  from  African  swine  fever  and  fall \narmyworm,  which  might  undermine  food  security  and  nutrition,  particularly  for  the  rural \npopulation.13 Persistent institutional and governance challenges in conjunction with discriminatory \ncultural norms mean gender disparities persist, with women lacking equitable access to key \nagricultural and rural resources and services, knowledge, and markets, despite their prominent \nrole in subsistence food production, agricultural value chains, and rural livelihoods.14 \n \n8.  Gender inequality. While aggregate data show that women comprise about 43% of the \nagricultural labor force in developing countries, the proportion of women directly engaged in the \ncommercial supply of farmed produce is estimated to be significantly lower because of their lack \nof secure control over land, labor, or other inputs required to guarantee the delivery of sufficient \nquantity  and  quality.15 Despite  their  significant  involvement  in  farming,  because  of  cultural \nattitudes, discrimination, and lack of recognition of their role, women have limited access to \n \n7  FAO. 2014.

On average, female farmers receive only 5% of all agricultural extension services.16 \nCOVID-19 threatens to expose and exacerbate gender differences. Expected to care for out-of-\nschool children or sick relatives, female farmers are more likely to bear the brunt of additional \ndomestic responsibilities. With less savings because of reduced remittances, women will be \nunable to weather income losses from the effects of COVID-19 and will likely struggle to buy the \nseeds and fertilizers needed for the following planting season. Women who are widowed because \nof COVID-19 risk disinheritance, as women\u2019s property rights are often conditional on marriage.17 \n \n9.  When women farmers have better access to technical training and the necessary inputs, \nthey are more likely to adopt good agricultural practices and improve their productivity. If women \nfarmers simply had the same access as men to productive resources, their agricultural yields \nwould increase by 20%\u201330% (footnote 18). Another major barrier to increasing female farmer \nproductivity is lack of female extension agents, with women unfortunately representing just 15% \nof the world\u2019s agents (footnote 18). Female farmers trained by female extension officers receive \nmore extension services, learn more, and apply more best practices than those trained by male \nextension officers.18 \n \n10.  Project selection. Olam is a global agribusiness that has a unique business model of \nsourcing directly from smallholder farmers. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has an existing \nrelationship with Olam, with loans in 2018 to OIL and Caf\u00e9 Outspan Vietnam Limited,19 OIL\u2019s \ninstant coffee plant in Viet Nam. ADB is providing technical assistance (TA) to Olam to train \n20,000 smallholder coffee farmers across Indonesia, PNG, Timor-Leste, and Viet Nam.20 Olam \nseeks to continue to support over 100,000 smallholder farmers from whom it directly procures raw \nmaterials and requested ADB to assist its business in the project countries that need more working \ncapital because of the COVID-19 crisis. \n \n2.  Project Design \n \n11.  The project will help sustain the livelihoods of smallholder farmers impacted by COVID-19 \nin Viet Nam, Indonesia, and PNG by providing working capital financing to OIL and OTPL to \nincrease raw material procurement from farmers. \n \n12.  Preserving smallholder farmer livelihoods in the COVID-19 context. The project will \nprovide working capital financing to OIL and OTPL for smallholder farmer supply in Viet Nam \n(coffee, cashews, and pepper); Indonesia (coffee and cocoa); and PNG (coffee and cocoa). \nWorking capital needs include higher inventory because of increased procurement of crops to \nbuild buffer inventory to cope with supply chain disruptions.21 The increase in advances to farmers \nand receivables from farmers and small traders will be financed, as well. The project will augment \nthe direct benefits to smallholder farmers by leveraging existing Olam sustainability programs that \n \n16 FAO. 2011. The State of Food and Agriculture 2010\u201311. Rome.

Smoothing supply chain disruptions. Despite COVID-19\u2013related disruptions, Olam, to \nsustain its business, will increase its procurement of crops from farmers, provide more advances \nto farmers, and increase its receivables from farmers and small traders. These activities will \nsupport smallholder farmers by providing stable offtake for their production. [Redacted] While the \ncash conversion cycle (number of working capital days) is expected to return to pre\u2013COVID-19 \nlevels by 2022, the expected growth will create additional working capital needs, which justifies \nthe medium-term financing solution. \n \n14.  [Redacted] While banks will continue to provide working capital, commercial banks have \nbeen reducing their exposure to commodities globally, including in Asia, because of the COVID-\n19 pandemic, leaving a \u201cfunding hole\u201d for crucial parts of the global food supply chain.25 This gap \nwill be bridged by the project. Uninterrupted funding to the food system must be ensured through \nintegrated agribusiness companies such as Olam that source directly from smallholder farmers. \nOlam\u2019s continued operations in the project countries will help keep food supply chains secure and \nfunctioning and mitigate the pandemic\u2019s impact on vulnerable groups, particularly for more than \n100,000 smallholder farmers from whom OIam directly sources raw materials. \n \n15.  Gender mainstreaming. The project aims to help bridge persistent gender gaps through \na gender action plan, which includes increasing the proportion of female farmers that Olam \nsources from, making Olam\u2019s farmer training programs more gender inclusive, and exploring more \ngender equality in farmer payment mechanisms. A strong gender element for the project will help \nmitigate the disproportionate impact that the pandemic has on female farmers. \n \n3.  Borrowers \n \n16.  The borrowers are OIL, a public limited company incorporated in Singapore, and OTPL, \nOIL\u2019s dedicated treasury company. OIL is a leading agribusiness company with presence in 70 \ncountries. It differentiates itself by focusing on niche commodities and businesses, buying from \ngrowers and village-level agents at the farm gate, and providing value-added solutions and \nservices  to  customers  (e.g.,  traceability  guarantees). 26Temasek  Holdings,  the  Singapore \nsovereign wealth fund, became the majority shareholder of OIL in 2014, owning 53.4%. Mitsubishi \nCorporation took a 20.0% equity stake in OIL in 2015. OIL\u2019s management team has a 6.5% \nownership in the company. The 13-member board includes two executive directors, one Temasek \nnominee, two Mitsubishi nominees, and eight independent directors. \n \n \n22 Olam assists smallholder farmers through the Olam Livelihood Charter, which assures customers that their product \nis sustainable and traceable and helps rural communities. \n23 As part of the TA, 6,000 smallholder coffee farmers will be trained in Indonesia, 4,000 in PNG, and 3,500 in Viet Nam.  \n24 ADB. 2017.

ADB conducted integrity due diligence on OIL and OTPL, their shareholders, managers, \nand significant contracting entities.27 They do not appear to constitute a significant or potentially \nsignificant integrity risk, as no unresolved or substantiated adverse media or other relevant \ninformation is related to them. Tax integrity due diligence was required only because of material \nrelated party transactions in the investment.28 The independent auditors of OIL and OTPL \nconfirmed that these transactions were conducted at arm\u2019s length, and details about them are \nreported in OIL\u2019s annual financial statements, which are reviewed by the Singapore Stock \nExchange. ADB\u2019s review of OIL and OTPL does not give ADB cause to believe that they are being \nused for money laundering, terrorism financing, tax secrecy, tax evasion, or tax fraud. \n \nB.  Development Impact, Outcomes, and Outputs \n \n18.  Impact. The project is aligned with the following impact: adverse social and economic \nimpact  of  the  COVID-19  pandemic  reduced,  especially  for  farmers.  Aligned  with  ADB\u2019s \nComprehensive Response to COVID-19,29 the project will help preserve the income of farmers by \nallowing Olam to continuously procure raw materials from them even during the pandemic. The \nproject is aligned with the target of the Sustainable Development Goals of ensuring sustainable \nfood  production  systems,  and  implementing  resilient  agricultural  practices  that  increase \nproductivity and production and strengthen capacity for adaptation to other disasters such as \nthose caused by the pandemic (Target 2.4).30 \n \n19.  Outcomes. The project will have the following outcome: Olam\u2019s trading and processing \noperations improved and farmers\u2019 livelihoods sustained. \n \n20.  Outputs. The project\u2019s outputs are procured raw materials increased, coffee farmer \ntraining programs designed to increase gender equality, and gender equality of benefit sharing \nwithin smallholder households improved. \n \nC.  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n \n21.  Consistency with ADB strategy and country strategy. The project is aligned with \nADB\u2019s Strategy 2030, which calls for ADB to \u201cscale up its financing for agribusiness\u201d and \u201cpromote \ngender equality in at least 75% of the number of ADB\u2019s committed operations by 2030.\u201d31 The \nproject is aligned with the Operational Plan for Private Sector Operations, 2019\u20132024, which calls \nfor working with tier-1 agribusiness companies because of their potential to have widespread \nimpact, including as partners in the TA.32 The project is consistent with ADB\u2019s country partnership \nstrategies for Viet Nam,33 Indonesia,34 and PNG.35 \n \n \n27 ADB. 2003.

THE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  The Assistance \n \n25.  ADB proposes to provide a loan facility of up to $93.75 million to OIL and OTPL. The loan \nwill be guaranteed by OIL. The use of loan proceeds will be earmarked for working capital in Viet \nNam, Indonesia, and PNG. The facility will have a maturity of 3 years. \n \nB.  Value Added by ADB Assistance \n26.  ADB assistance will add value in three areas: \n(i)  Filling  a  market  gap  for  commodity  traders.  Because  of  the  COVID-19 \npandemic,  a  few  second-tier  commodity  traders  have  defaulted,41 or  have \nstruggled  to  refinance  their  debt  obligations  as  markets  have  become  more \nvolatile.42 While commercial banks are comfortable renewing existing lines to large \ncommodity traders, increasing exposure has proven to be a challenge. ADB\u2019s \nworking capital loan will (a) deliver immediate support for incremental working \ncapital needs of Olam for smallholder farmer supply, receivables, and farmer \nadvances; and (b) step in to fill insufficient liquidity from commercial banks. \n(ii)  Gender mainstreaming. The strong gender element for the project in the COVID-\n19 context will help address the disproportionate impact that the pandemic is \nhaving on female farmers and women living in rural poverty.  \n[Redacted] \n \nC.  Risks \n \n[Redacted] \n \nIV.  POLICY COMPLIANCE \nA.  Safeguards and Social Dimensions \n27.  ADB has categorized the loan in compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement \n(2009) as follows: environment category C, involuntary resettlement category C, and indigenous \npeoples category C. ADB has undertaken due diligence and reviewed the project\u2019s potential \nenvironmental and social impacts and the measures in the safeguard reports and plans to avoid, \nminimize, mitigate, and compensate for adverse impacts. The environmental and social measures \nand the institutional capacity and commitment of Olam to manage the project\u2019s social and \nenvironmental impacts are deemed adequate. \n \n28.  The loan will be used to finance working capital for OIam\u2019s raw material procurement in \nthe project countries. The loan is a follow-on to the existing loan approved by the ADB Board of \nDirectors in 2017 and aims to support response to or reduce adverse socioeconomic impacts of \nCOVID-19 on smallholder farmers.
