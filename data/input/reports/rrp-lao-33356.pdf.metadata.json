Most  of  the  large  water  sector  investments  have  also  been \nmade  in  this  river  basin.  However,  water  sector  planning,  development, \nand  management  have  been  suboptimal.  To  effectively  exploit  the \nconsiderable  potential  of \nthe  Government  adopted \nthis  resource, \nintegrated water resource management (IWRM) by establishing the Water \nResources  Coordination  Committee  (WRCC)  in  1998.  The  proposed \nProject  will  help  the  Government  implement  IWRM  by  (i)  fostering  and \ninstitutionalizing it in the Government\u2019s mainstream management process, \nand  (ii)  supporting \nin  relatively  degraded \nwatersheds of NNRB to provide sustainable livelihood opportunities for the \npoor ethnic groups. \n \nIn the Lao People's Democratic Republic (Lao PDR), water is vital for the \ncountry\u2019s  economic  development,  which  is  mainly  based  on  agricultural \nproduction and hydropower generation. Agriculture contributes about 40%, \nand  hydropower  another  30%  to  total  foreign  exchange  earnings.  About \n90%  of  the  population  depends  on  agriculture.  Optimal  use  of  water \nresources  is  critical  to  realizing  the  Government\u2019s  strategic  objectives  of \npoverty  reduction  and  sustainable  economic  growth.  Water  resources  in \nthe  Lao  PDR  also  have  regional  significance:  over  35%  of  the  total \nMekong  River  flow  is  generated  in  Lao  PDR  watersheds.  In  the  past  few \nyears, the Government has introduced various legislative and institutional \nmeasures  to  manage  water  resources  efficiently  and  effectively.  In  1996, \nthe  Water  Law  was  approved,  and  in  1998,  the  WRCC  was  established \nwith  a  mandate  to  coordinate  the  activities  of  line  agencies  involved  in \nwater  sector  management.  In  2001,  a  prime  ministerial  decree  was \napproved to implement the Water Law. To foster IWRM, the Government \nhas  focused  on  key  areas  in  agriculture  and  hydropower  to  optimize  the \nwater resources. However, the most significant institutional problem in the \nwater  sector  is  the  inadequate  coordination  among  key  central  agencies \nand provincial departments. Twelve central agencies are directly involved \nin water sector management while another 10 have a direct interest in it. \nSince  two  provinces,  the  capital,  and  a  special  zone  share  NNRB,  they \nalso  have  a  direct  stake  in  its  water  resource  management.  A  functional \nmechanism  to  coordinate  and  implement  IWRM  at  central  and  provincial \nlevels is not yet in place as WRCC requires further capacity building and \nresource  mobilization.  In  particular,  a  system  needs  to  be  developed  at \nthat  water  resource \ncommunity,  district,  and  provincial \nmanagement  can  become  efficient  and  equitable  in  line  with  the \nGovernment\u2019s policy of decentralized planning.   NNRB is one of the  most   \n\nlevels  so \n\n\fiv\n\n \n\n \n\n \nObjectives and \nScope \n\n \nCost Estimates \n\nthey  offer,  an \n\nlivelihood  opportunities \n\nimportant  river  basins  in  the  country,  with  a  150  megawatts  (MW) \nhydropower generation project and more are planned. However, the Nam \nNgum  reservoir  is  not  efficiently  managed,  resulting  in  suboptimal \nhydropower  generation  and \ninefficient  maintenance  of  downstream \nriverine ecosystems. Although the annual water flow per capita or per unit \nof  land  gives  an  impression  of  abundant  water  resources  in  NNRB,  the \nseasonal  nature  of  rainfall  and  interriver  water  transfers  create  seasonal \nand  spatial  water  shortages.  An  intersectoral  water  allocation  plan  to \naddress  these  issues  is  not  yet  in  place.    While  it  is  not  yet  a  problem, \nwater  quality  needs  to  be  monitored  closely  as  agriculture  is  intensive \nupstream.  Effective  water  management  will  require  developing  and \napplying  skills  and  technology  to  improve  reservoir  management.  At  the \nsame  time,  the  subwatersheds  in  the  upper  basin  are  critical  for \nsustainable  development.  These  subwatersheds  contain \nimportant \nbiodiversity and are home to ethnic groups, who are among the poorest in \nthe  country.  Many  of  these  subwatersheds  are  already  under  pressure \nfrom  agriculture  that  is  based  on  shifting  cultivation  and  exploitation  of \nforest  products.  At  current  use  levels,  these  activities  are  unsustainable. \nTo ensure long-term sustainability of the upper basin subwatersheds and \nthe \nintegrated  development \napproach ought to be fostered among farming communities, line agencies, \nand  departments.  By  implementing  a  variety  of  integrated  activities,  the \nProject will provide an impetus to that end. \n \nOptimal use of water resources in the country is the long-term goal of the \nProject.  Two  immediate  objectives  of  the  Project  are  to  (i)  foster  and \ninstitutionalize  IWRM  in  the  mainstream  management  process  of  the \nGovernment  at  the  central,  provincial,  and  district  levels;  and  (ii)  support \ninvestment  interventions  in  relatively  degraded  parts  of  NNRB  to  ensure \nsustainable  watershed  management  and \nlivelihood \nopportunities  for  the  poor  and  ethnic  groups.  The  Project  has  three  main \ncomponents:  (i)  IWRM,  (ii)  reservoir  management  and  river  basin \nmodeling,  and  (iii)  watershed  management.  The  first  will  strengthen  the \ncapacity  of  the  WRCC  to  be  more  effective  as  a  water  resource \ncoordination body at the central level and, through the NNRB Committee \n(NNRBC),  at  the  provincial  level.  The  second  component  will  help  the \nMinistry  of  Industry  and  Handicraft  (MIH)  devise  a  more  effective \nmanagement  regime  for  the  Nam  Ngum  1  reservoir  to  optimize  power \ngeneration,  mitigate  floods,  and  improve  water  use  efficiency  in  NNRB. \nThe  third  will  (i)  strengthen  capacity  of  the  Integrated  Watershed \nManagement Unit of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry (MAF) and its \nrelevant provincial and district departments, (ii) increase crop productivity \nand irrigation efficiency, (iii) improve livestock and fisheries management, \nand (iv) preserve and restore forest resources. \n \nThe  project  cost,  including  contingencies,  taxes,  and  duties,  is  estimated \nat  $23.0  million  equivalent,  consisting  of  a  foreign  exchange  cost  of  $9.4 \nmillion (41%) and local currency cost of $13.6 million (59%) equivalent. \n\nto  provide \n\n\fFinancing Plan \n\n \n\n($ million) \n\n  v\n\nSource \n\n \nADB \nAFD \nGovernment \n \n\nTotal \n\nForeign \nExchange \n\nLocal \nCurrency \n\nTotal \nCost \n\nPercent \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n6.9 \n2.5 \n0.0 \n \n9.4 \n\n8.1 \n1.3 \n4.2 \n \n13.6 \n\n15.0 \n  3.8 \n  4.2 \n \n23.0 \n\n65 \n17 \n18 \n \n100 \n\nADB = Asian Development Bank, AFD = Agence Francaise de Developpement. \n \nThe  loan  will  be  $15  million  equivalent  in  special  drawing  rights  from  the \nSpecial Funds resources of the Asian Development Bank (ADB). The loan \nwill  have  a  term  of  32  years,  including  a  grace  period  of  8  years  with  a \nservice charge of 1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per \nannum thereafter. \n \n31 March 2009 \n\n \n30 September 2008 \n\n \nMinistry of Agriculture and Forestry  \n\n \nA  project  steering  committee  headed  by  the  vice  minister  of  MAF  will  be \nestablished to advise on project implementation and to review its progress. \nOffice  of  the  National  Project  Manager  (ONPM)  has  been  established  in \nthe Department of Planning, MAF. Three project implementation units, one \neach, in the WRCC, Hydropower Office of MIH, and National Agricultural \nand  Forestry  Extension  Service  of  MAF,  headed  by  project  coordinators, \nhave  also  been  established  to  implement  their  respective  components.  A \nproject  performance  management  unit  in  ONPM  will  monitor  project \nprogress. Specific investment interventions in the selected subprojects will \nbe planned and implemented by the provincial departments in cooperation \nwith the NNRBC. \n \nGoods and services, financed by the loan, will be procured in accordance \nwith  the  ADB  Guidelines  for  Procurement.  Vehicles,  equipment,  civil \nworks,  and  material  will  be  procured  by  international  competitive  bidding \nwhere the cost is more than $500,000, or by international shopping where \nthe  cost  is  from  $100,000  to  $500,000.  Vehicles,  equipment,  civil  works, \nand material valued at less than $100,000 equivalent, and for which there \nare  several  local  suppliers  with  satisfactory  service  facilities,  may  be \nprocured under local competitive procedures, or through direct purchase. \n\nLoan Amount and \nTerms \n\n \nPeriod of \nUtilization \n \nEstimated Project \nCompletion Date \n \nExecuting \nAgency \n \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\n \nProcurement \n\n\fvi\n\n \n\nConsulting \nServices \n\n \nProject Benefits \nand Beneficiaries \n\n \nRisks and \nAssumptions \n\n \n\nTo  support  project  implementation  and  capacity  building,  239  person-\nmonths  of  international  and  413  person-months  of  domestic  consulting \nservices  will  be  required.  Consulting  services  will  be  recruited  in  two \npackages.  ADB  will  finance  one  package  of  137  person-months  of \ninternational  and  201  person-months  of  domestic  consultants.  An \ninternational  firm,  in  association  with  a  domestic  firm,  will  be  engaged  to \nprovide  the  required  support  as  per  ADB  Guidelines  for  the  Use  of \nConsultants  and  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB.  The  Agence \nFrancaise  de  Developpement  (AFD)  will  finance,  in  parallel,  another \npackage of 102 person-months of international and 212 person-months of \ndomestic  consulting  services.  Consultants  for  this  package  will  be \nrecruited  as  per  AFD  procedures.  All  consultants  will  work  following  a \nconsolidated  work  plan  and  reporting  to  the  single  team  leader  engaged \nunder the ADB package. \n \nAt  the  national  level,  project  benefits  will  arise  from  optimal  use  of  water \nresources  by  institutionalizing  IWRM.  A  strengthened  WRCC  will  be  able \nto effectively coordinate water resource management among different line \nagencies. Efficient operation of the Nam Ngum 1 reservoir will provide an \nadditional  2%  or  20  gigawatt  hours  of  hydropower  (worth  $600,000)  per \nyear, mitigate floods, and improve water conservation. Other benefits will \nstem  from  the  efficient  use  of  water  in  agriculture,  leading  to  increased \nproductivity  and  household  incomes.  Adoption  of  improved  land-use \npractices will maintain the water quality in the long run. At the grassroots, \nsubprojects  will  target  poor  communities  in  the  upper  basin  and  greatly \nbenefit  ethnic  groups  and  women.  Through  crop  improvement,  livestock \nand fishery management, and restoration forestry household incomes will \nincrease significantly while maintaining sustainable livelihood systems and \nthe  environment.  A  household\u2019s  annual  non-cash  income  is  expected  to \nincrease by 34%; from $650 to $935, and cash income would increase by \n5\u20136  fold;  from  $50  to  $355.  These  benefits  will  ensure  food  security  and \nprovide cash income for better education and health services. Provision of \nalternative  livelihood  opportunities  will  ensure  that  forest  degradation,  on \nabout  30,000  ha,  is  stabilized  and  shifting  cultivation,  on  another  25,000 \nha,  is  reduced  so  that  land-use  patterns  optimize  water  conservation. \nSince the Project will adopt a sector-lending modality, the exact number of \nbeneficiaries  cannot  be  determined  at  the  outset.  By  project  completion, \naround 10,000 households will have directly benefited of which more than \n25%  live  below  the  poverty  line.  The  estimated  economic  internal  rate  of \nreturn, for base case, is 24.7% indicating economic viability of the Project.  \n \nThe  WRCC,  Hydropower  Office,  MAF,  and  provincial  departments  are \nshort  of  human  resources  and  receive  inadequate  budgetary  allocations. \nCapacity  building  will  depend  on  finding  resources,  especially  for  the \nWRCC  secretariat,  for  which  a  significant  increase  in  qualified  technical \nstaff is proposed. The investment interventions in agriculture and forestry \ndepend on the capability of the provincial and district staff. The Project will \nhelp  by  building  some  aspects  of  staff  capacity,  but  the  success  and \nsustainability of the project interventions will depend largely on the overall \nability  and  willingness  of  the  Government  to  plan  and  implement  the \ninterventions in cooperation with local authorities and communities. \n\n\f \n\n\f \n\n\f \n\n\f \n\n\f \n\n\f \n\n\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n1. \nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto  the  Lao  People\u2019s  Democratic  Republic  (Lao  PDR)  for  the  Nam  Ngum  River  Basin  (NNRB) \nDevelopment Sector Project.1 The project processing chronology is in Appendix 1. \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nA. \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n1. \n\nThe Economy and the Water Sector \n\nThe  Lao  PDR  is  a  land-locked  country  spread  over  about  236,800  square  kilometers \n2. \n(km2). It has rich and varied natural resources, of which water is the most important. During the \nlast 5 years, the country has achieved an average gross domestic product (GDP) growth rate of \nabout 6% per annum and reduced the incidence of poverty from 45% to 39%, which, in light of \nthe  regional  economic  slowdown  in  the  late  1990s,  are  impressive  achievements.  The \nGovernment  projects  similar  economic  growth  in  the  next  3  years.  Agriculture  is  the  largest \nsector  of  the  economy,  accounting  for  about  half  of  GDP.  Over  85%  of  the  country\u2019s  5  million \npeople live in rural areas. About 90% of the rural population lives on subsistence farming and \nmany  people  also  depend  on  food  gathering  from  forests  and  rivers.  Fish  accounts  for  about \n40%  of  the  animal  protein  in  the  national  diet.  Managing  water  resources2  effectively  and \nefficiently is necessary to reduce poverty and promote economic growth. Agriculture contributes \nabout 40% and hydropower another 30% to total foreign exchange earnings. The Government \nhas planned major expansion of irrigation and hydropower projects to reduce poverty and spur \neconomic  growth.  These  projects  will  impact  on  communities  in  the  river  basins  and  on  the \nenvironment  in  general  and  water  resources  in  particular.  Despite  the  country\u2019s  significant \ndependence  on  water  resources,  the  water  sector  planning  and  development  process  has  not \nyet  institutionalized  integrated  water  resources  management  (IWRM)  approach,  which  would \noptimize the returns on hydropower and irrigation investments without compromising the long-\nterm quality of the environment and the well being of local communities. Water resources in the \nLao PDR also have regional significance\u2014over 35% of total Mekong river flow is generated in \nthe country\u2019s watersheds. \n \n3. \nIn  agriculture,  the  main  thrust  has  been  to  develop  irrigated  agriculture  to  ensure  food \nself-sufficiency. The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry (MAF) aims to increase rural incomes \nand  stabilize  rice  productivity  and  availability  by  expanding  irrigated  areas  for  wet-  and  dry- \nseason production. Much of the irrigated area development has taken place on the floodplain of \nNNRB,  which  is  adjacent  to  the  capital,  Vientiane.  Expansion  of  irrigated  area  coupled  with \ndissemination of modern technology has enabled the country to attain food self-sufficiency since \n1999,  when  the  rice  production  exceeded  2  million  tons  (t)  for  the  first  time.3  Despite  food \nautarky  at  the  national  level,  food  shortages  occur  in  many  pockets  around  the  country, \nespecially  in  the  northern  uplands.  In  recent  years,  attention  has  turned  to  improving  the \noperation and maintenance of existing irrigation systems in the lowlands and developing small-\n\n                                                 \n1   The proposed Project is included in the 2002 ADB Country Strategy and Program for the Lao PDR. \n2  Water and related natural resources, such as forests and fisheries, are collectively referred to as water resources \n\nin this report. \n\n3   The  technological  package  has  mainly  been  developed  and  delivered  by  the  Lao-International  Rice  Research \nInstitute  Project.  During  this  12-year  collaborative  project,    total  rice  production  increased  by  over  53%  from  1.5 \nmillion tons (t) in 1990 to 2.3 million t in 2001. \n\n\f2 \n\nin \n\nthe  uplands \n\nto  encourage  crop  diversification.4  Upland  agricultural \nscale  systems \ndevelopment has focused on the impact of agriculture on key watersheds and aimed to reduce \nshifting cultivation. Livestock development is also of major concern especially in NNRB\u2019s upland \nplateau  of  Xieng  Khouang  Province.  Generally,  central,  provincial,  and  district  agricultural \ninstitutions  have  weak  technical  capacity  and  inadequate  resources  to  support  outreach \nprograms. As a result, agriculture is beset by low productivity across all its subsectors. \n \n\n2. \n\nNam Ngum River Basin \n\n \nNNRB  covers  a  large  area,  about  16,906  km2,  in  north-central  Lao  PDR,  including  \n4. \nVientiane.  Geographically,  the  hydraulic  boundary  of  the  NNRB  cuts  across  the  administrative \nboundaries  of  Vientiane  Province,  Vientiane  Municipality,  Xieng  Khouang  Province, \nXaisomboun Special Zone, and the small southeastern tip of Louang Prabang Province. Annual \naverage rainfall is 1,400\u20133,000 millimeters. Most of the estimated rural population5 of 575,000 in \nthe basin has significant ethnic diversity and is highly mobile\u201460% move at least once a year. \nIncidence  of  poverty  is  high;  about  40%  of  the  population  reports  annual  rice  shortages  for  4 \nmonths or longer. Over 65% of the population lives below the poverty line of $11.20 per capita \nper  month.6  Despite  the  war  in  the  1960s  and  early  1970s  and  the  development  of  the  Nam \nNgum  1  (NN-1)  hydropower  project  in  1971,  the  impact  on  forests,  water  quality,  and  erosion \nhas  been  minimal.  However,  the  construction  of  the  NN-1  dam  has  restricted  the  migration  of \nfisheries downstream. Although the river basin is in transition, its main characteristics are stable. \n \n5. \nNNRB is the most important river basin in the country for several reasons. It is the first \nlarge river basin where water resources were utilized significantly through inter-river and inter-\nwatershed  diversions,  reservoir  management,  hydropower  generation,  and  irrigation.  Several \nprospective hydropower projects have been identified in this river basin.7 As NNRB is close to \nthe capital, IWRM can be developed in close coordination with all the relevant stakeholders.  \n \n\n3. \n\nWater Sector Planning \n\n6. \nWater  is  the  most  vital  economic  input  to  agricultural  production  and  hydropower \ngeneration.  Within  the  water  sector,  various  development  activities  are  being  undertaken  to \nreduce  poverty,  increase  agricultural  production,  and  raise  foreign  exchange  earnings  through \nhydropower  exports  to  Thailand.  This  development  strategy  is  expected  to  spur  equitable  \neconomic growth, particularly through regional development in the provinces. \n \nThe Government has made a steady progress in water sector and river basin planning \n7. \nsince  the  mid  1990s  (Appendix  2).  In  1997,  recognizing  the  great  development  potential  of \nNNRB  for  hydropower  and  agriculture,  the  Government  carried  out  a  study  under  an  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) technical assistance (TA) to develop a management plan for the Nam \nNgum  watershed.8  The  study  outlined  and  evaluated  alternative  hydropower  and  agricultural \ndevelopment  scenarios  and  recommended  investment  proposals  to  expand  development \nopportunities  and  enhance  environmental  mitigation  efforts.  The  Integrated  Watershed \nManagement  Unit  (IWMU)  was  set  up  in  the  Department  of  Planning,  MAF.  Supported  until \nrecently  under  a  Danish  International  Development  Agency  (DANIDA)  project  for  institutional \n                                                 \n4  BMB  Management  Consultants.  2000.

Technical Assistance for Nam Ngum Watershed Management Plan. Manila. \n\n\f \n\n3 \n\nstrengthening, the unit is an important element in the planning of rural development projects at \nthe subwatershed level. After the Nam Ngum watershed study, the Government recognized the \nneed to apply IWRM holistically in the whole NNRB rather than just the upper watershed or its \nsubwatersheds. \n \n8. \nSince  the  Government\u2019s  development  strategy  emphasizes  poverty  reduction  and \neconomic  growth  through  improved  management  of  water  resources,  IWRM  is  necessary  to \nreinforce  links  and  synergies  between  water  and  land  use,  the  environment,  and  sustainable \ndevelopment.  The  Government  has  already  taken  steps  to  introduce  this  approach,  helped  by \nseveral  ADB  TAs  after  TA  2734-LAO.  The  Government  has  approved  the  Water  and  Water \nResources  Law  (the  Water  Law)  and  documented  issues  relevant  to  river  basin  planning  and \nmanagement through consultations with the concerned stakeholders, and prepared the National \nWater Sector Profile (NWSP) and Water Sector Strategy and Action Plan (SAP). SAP, already \napproved  by  the  Government,  addresses  cross-sectoral  issues  by  emphasizing  appropriate \npolicy,  community  education,  and  data  management.  As  a  first  step  to  build  capacity  to \nimplement  these  policies  and  plans,  the  Government  established  the  Water  Resources \nCoordination Committee (WRCC) in February 1998.9 \n \n9. \nThe Government has implemented the most important elements of SAP and the Water \nLaw  by  addressing  nation-wide  issues  of  policy  development.10  The  implementation  of  these \npolicies and plan has increased the WRCC\u2019s capacity. The Government also aims to strengthen \nthe institutional capacity of other relevant agencies to deal with social and environmental risks \nparticularly  for  the  energy  and  transport  sectors.11  To  implement  the  Water  Law,  a  prime \nministerial decree was approved in September 2001. \n \n10. \nThe WRCC has decided that each main tributary catchment of the Mekong River in the \nLao PDR, including the Nam Ngum watershed, will be classified as a river basin where planning \nuses  IWRM,  to  ensure  that  the  effects  of  development  on  downstream  areas  are  fully \nconsidered. For the Lao PDR, this is a new approach. In the past, planning was generally based \non an administrative boundary (i.e. district) rather than that of hydraulic (i.e., subwatershed) with \nlittle interagency coordination. For example, strategy and planning have been completed for the \nNam  Ngum  Watershed  (NNWS)  upstream  of  NN-1  dam.  Previous  planning  was  done  in \nisolation, either by the Ministry of Industry and Handicrafts (MIH) for hydropower generation or \nby MAF for watershed management. \n \n11. \nADB\u2019s investments in the water sector have accounted for 53% of TAs and 30% of loans \nto  the  Lao  PDR.  These  investments  have  mainly  been  allocated  to  three  subsectors: \nhydropower  (71%),  water  supply  (17%),  and  irrigation  (12%).  The  Government  also  receives \nassistance for the water sector from the World Bank, Food and Agriculture Organization, United \nNations Development Programme and other agencies, including the Mekong River Commission. \nThe external assistance to water sector in NNRB is summarized in Appendix 3. \n \n12. \nThe  Government  has  made  a  concerted  effort  in  water  sector  reform  since  1997  by  (i) \ncarrying out a sector study and preparing NWSP, (ii) adopting the Water Law, (iii) establishing \nthe  WRCC,  (iv)  implementing  sector  strategies  and  an  action  plan,  (v)  preparing  the  NNRB \nprofile,  and  (vi)  approving  the  prime  ministerial  decree  to  implement  the  Water  Law.

The  Government  has  decided  that  further  sector \nreforms  will  be  implemented  by  adopting  IWRM  in  important  river  basins,  starting  with  NNRB. \nThe  proposed  Project  will  help  continue  water  sector  reform  and  implement  an  investment \nproject in NNRB by combining investments in physical and institutional infrastructure, using an \nintegrated approach and in consultation with the relevant stakeholders. The proposed Project is \nfully consistent with ADB\u2019s water policy.12 \n \nB. \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\n1. \n\nIntegrated Water Resources Management and Institutional Coordination \n\nThe most important institutional problem in the water sector in the Lao PDR is the lack of \n13. \ncoordination between key sector agencies. Twelve water agencies (all members of WRCC) and \nanother 10 have a direct interest in water resources. Along with agriculture, hydropower has a \nsignificant  stake  in  this  sector.  The  MIH  Department  of  Electricity  determines  policies,  plans, \nlaws, and regulations to develop and manage the production and distribution of electricity. The \ndepartment reviews and evaluates power project proposals, contracts, and agreements. Other \nagencies such as transport, health, and education also deal with issues directly related to water.  \n \nThe  prime  ministerial  decree  defines  the  structure  of  water  resource  planning  and \n14. \nmanagement at two levels: national and river basin. At the national level, the WRCC is to act as \nan  inter-agency  coordinator  for  sustainable  use  of  water  resources  based  on  IWRM13  and \nfacilitate the implementation of the Water Law and other resource legislation, such as the Land \nLaw and various pieces of planning legislation. SAP has established linkages between national \nsocio-economic  goals  and  water  resources,  and  identified  the  national  objectives,  strategies, \nand  priorities  for  water  resource  management,  including  institutional  issues.  At  the  river  basin \nlevel,  the  WRCC  is  to  foster  and  support  the  development  of  river  basin  committees.  The \nNNRBC was established in mid-2001 and comprises Vientiane Province, Vientiane Municipality, \nXieng Khouang Province, and Xaisomboun Special Zone.14 However, the incipient WRCC and \nNNRBC  have  not  been  able  to  play  their  roles  as  envisaged  in  their  mandates  due  mainly  to \nweak technical capacity and allocation of inadequate resources. \n \n15.  While the Government has adopted IWRM, a practical mechanism to implement it is not \nyet  in  place.  IWRM  is  applied  to  hydraulic  boundaries,  implying  that  the  water  resources \nmanagement unit would be a river basin\u2014an area of land draining to one point, i.e., the Nam \nNgum River\u2019s outlet to the Mekong River. IWRM is an important development since river basins \ncut across administrative boundaries. IWRM is also in line with the basic premise underlying the \nWater Law as well as its recent decentralization policy,15 representing an important opportunity \nto develop water resource management systems under the WRCC attuned to the Government\u2019s \nrequirements. In May 2002, MAF was entrusted with overall rural development rather than just \n\n                                                 \n12 ADB. 2001. Water for All: The Water Policy of the Asian Development Bank. Manila. \n13 Like IWRM, river basin management seeks to improve the planning, conservation, development, and management \nof  water,  forest,  land,  and  aquatic  resources  to  equitably  maximize  economic  benefits  and  social  welfare  without \ncompromising environmental sustainability. Typically, IWRM is undertaken in river basins because they or, in some \ncases, groundwater basins, form the natural unit to manage water resources. \n\n14The  NNRBC  was  established  with  assistance  from  TA  3544-LAO.  It  has  also  helped  prepare  this  Project  by \nproviding significant stakeholder inputs and identifying potential activities and Project components, through formal \nworkshops and numerous community consultations.   \n\n15 The decentralization policy adopted in March 2000 (Instruction 01/PM 11/03/2000) aims to empower provincial and \ndistrict  authorities  to  manage  local  financial  and  natural  resources.  Under  this  policy,  provinces  are  strategic \nplanning unit; districts, planning and budgeting units; and villages, implementing units. \n\n\f \n\n5 \n\nagricultural development and can now implement the Water Law and other legislation related to \nrural  development  at  the  provincial  and  district  levels.  IWRM  thus  needs  to  be  fostered  at  the \nnational  level  for  interagency  and  at  the  decentralized  level  for  interprovincial  coordination.  A \nstrengthened and fully functional WRCC would be a more effective coordinator.  \n \n\n2. \n\nHydropower Generation and Reservoir Management in River Basins \n\n16. \nHydropower  generation  is  important  to  optimize  water  resources.  The  policy  objectives \nof  hydropower  generation  and  expansion  relate  to  an  affordable,  reliable,  and  sustainable \nsupply and export of surplus power to meet development objectives. Given the quantity of water \nresources,  the  country\u2019s  huge  hydropower  potential  could  generate  considerable  export \nsurplus,16  but  only  if  specific  hydropower  schemes  are  developed.  The  economic  viability  of \nthese  projects  depends  on  the  export  price  of  electricity  for  which  the  Lao  PDR  has  some \ncomparative advantage. The proposed hydropower projects at varying stages of planning (11 of \nwhich are in NNRB)17 will have an enormous impact on the environment and people. Managing \nthe  effects  of  such  schemes  on  river  basins  will  require  effective  coordination  among  the \nconcerned  agencies  and  further  strengthening  of  their  technical  capacity.  Management  of \nreservoirs  will  be  essential  in  producing  low-cost  and  reliable  hydropower  while  ensuring \neffective flood mitigation and safeguarding water allocation rights of downstream users. \n \nThe  largest  reservoir  in  the  country,  NN-1  is  not  managed  along  these  principles.  The \n17. \nHydropower  Office  (HPO)  of  MIH,  entrusted  with  the  reservoir\u2019s  operation  and  management, \nconsiders  hydropower  generation  its  foremost  priority  rather  than  optimizing  NNRB's  overall \nwater  resources.  Even  the  operation  of  NN-1  is  not  optimized  for  want  inflow  forecasting \nmechanisms and a well-calibrated river basin model. Due to lack of such decision-making tools, \nhydropower generation is not optimized. Besides, during the wet season, when other tributaries \nand  the  Mekong  River  itself  have  high  water  levels,  this  operational  regime  sometimes \naggravates  floods.  Conversely,  during  the  dry  season,  water  requirements  of  many  schemes \nand  communities  downstream  are  not  met  as  water  is  released  from  the  reservoir  only  for \nhydropower  generation.  By  establishing  a  holistic  reservoir  management  regime,  based  on  a \nriver basin model, many of these constraints can be overcome and/or their impact minimized. \n \n\nAgricultural Development in Critical Watersheds \n\n3. \nThe  Government\u2019s  agricultural  development  strategy18  classifies  agricultural  areas  into \n18. \ntwo  main  agronomic  zones:  (i)  the  sloping  lands  (including  upland  plateaus  and  valley  floors) \nand  (ii)  the  flatlands  along  the  Mekong  Corridor.  Sloping  lands  include  key  watersheds  (many \nare  in  NNRB)  and  forest  cover,  which  are  essential  for  the  long-term  sustainability  of  water \nresources in NNRB. Population per hectare of cultivable land in the upland areas is dense and \nincreasing in excess of 2.5%, reducing fallow periods for land under shifting cultivation from 14 \nyears to 5\u20137 years. Conflicts over water, especially in the dry season, have increased in some \nareas.  Many  communities  report  rice  shortages  for  4  months  or  longer  each  year.  Poverty  is \nendemic; in many areas 30\u201350% households live below the poverty line. Poor rural folk, mostly \nethnic  groups,  often  depend  on  livestock  and  forest  products  for  cash.  However,  livestock  is \nprone to high morbidity and mortality rates, and the timber and forest product industry is based \n\n                                                 \n16  In  2000,  the  domestic  consumption  of  power  was  554  gigawatt  hours  (GWh),  leaving  653  GWh  for  export.  The \n\nexported power was valued at $16.9 million\u2014about 7.5% of total exports. \n\n17  If  all  the  proposed  hydropower  schemes  were  developed\u2014a  highly  unlikely  prospect\u2014more  than  80%  of  the \nagricultural  land  in  NNRB  would  be  inundated.  However,  even  the  development  of  the  most  probable  next \nhydropower scheme in NNRB, Nam Ngum 3, is only a remote possibility. \n\n18  As  outlined  in  the  Master  Plan  Study  on  Integrated  Agricultural  Development  in  Lao  PDR:  Profiles  for  Priority \n\nProjects and Programs. Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, October 2001. \n\n\f6 \n\non  exploiting  the  resource  base  rather  than  managing  it  in  a  sustainable  manner.  These \nlivelihood systems are a threat to NNRB watersheds and water supply. In the flatlands of NNRB, \neffective  use  of  water  has  been  a  prime  concern  in  the  irrigated  areas.  Overirrigation  leads  to \nsalinization while the increased adoption of HYVs of rice and other cash crops requires a higher \nuse of fertilizers and other chemical inputs, which need careful management and monitoring to \nsafeguard water quality. In general, agriculture is constrained by an underresourced extension \nservice  and  poor  access  to  technology  by  local  communities,  resulting  in  sub-optimal  use  of \nwater resources in NNRB. The problem-tree analysis is in Appendix 4. \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nObjectives \n\nOptimal use of water resources, especially in NNRB, is the long-term project goal. Two \n19. \nimmediate  project  objectives  are  to  (i)  foster  and  institutionalize  IWRM  in  the  mainstream \nplanning  process  of  the  Government  at  the  central  and  provincial  levels,  and  (ii)  support \ninvestment interventions in relatively degraded parts of NNRB to provide sustainable livelihood \nopportunities for poor and ethnic communities. NNRB was selected as the first to initiate these \nactivities due to its vital existing and planned water sector investments as well as its proximity to \nVientiane. This Project is the culmination of continuing efforts of the Government and ADB over \nthe  last  several  years  to  establish  and  strengthen  water  sector  institutions  for  their  closer  and \nmore effective coordination. The design of this Project will afford the first opportunity to central \nand provincial departments to implement IWRM through hands-on, closely interlinked activities. \nThe project framework is in Appendix 5. \n \nB. \n\nComponents and Outputs \n\n20. \nTo  meet  its  objectives,  the  Project  has  three  main  components:  (i)  IWRM,  (ii)  reservoir \nmanagement  and  river  basin  modeling,  and  (iii)  watershed  management.  The  first  will \nstrengthen the capacity of the WRCC to coordinate efforts at the central level and, through the \nNNRBC,  at  provincial,  level.  The  second  component  will  help  HPO  devise  a  more  effective \nmanagement regime for the NN-1 reservoir to optimize power generation, mitigate floods, and \nimprove  water-use  efficiency  in  NNRB.  The  third  component  will  (i)  strengthen  the  capacity  of \nthe  IWMU  of  MAF  and  its  other  relevant  provincial  and  district  departments,  (ii)  increase  crop \nproductivity  and  irrigation  efficiency,  (iii)  improve  livestock  and  fishery  management,  and  (i) \npreserve  and  restore  forest  resources.  Watershed  management  activities  selected  through  an \nintegrated  water  resources  planning  process  at  the  village,  district,  and  provincial  levels\u2014a \nconsultative  process  facilitated  by  the  WRCC  and  NNRBC\u2014will  further  embed  IWRM  in  all \ngovernment tiers.  \n \n21. \nThe activities of the first two components are focused, specific, and directly related to the \nfunctions of the WRCC and HPO, respectively. However, to implement the investment activities \nof the third component, the Project will have to adopt a sector lending approach. The activities \nof  the  watershed  management  component  illustrate  the  kinds  of  interventions  that  will  be \nundertaken  during  project  implementation.  These  activities  were  selected  from  examples \npresented  to  the  WRCC  by  the  provincial  planning  departments  represented  on  the  NNRBC, \nand  from  participatory  rural  assessments  (PRAs)  conducted  in  local  communities,  and  are \nfocused on the poor upland areas of NNRB. PRAs highlighted the following high-priority needs \nof local communities: (i) set up revolving funds; (ii) provide rural water supply schemes; (iii) build \nrural  access  pathways;  and  (iv)  organize  and  train  people  to  improve  their  livelihood.  Since \nthese are relatively high-risk activities and cannot be financed under the Project, a Japan Fund \nfor  Poverty  Reduction  (JFPR)  project  is  being  prepared  for  parallel  implementation  with  this \n\n\f \n\n7 \n\nProject.  The  JFPR  project  will  provide  grant  financing  for  economic  and  social  investments  to \nimprove  sustainable  livelihood  opportunities  for  the  poor,  especially  ethnic  women,  based  on \ntheir  noted  priorities.  Direct  synergies  exist  between  the  activities  proposed  under  the  JFPR \nproject  and  this  Project.  JFPR  project  activities  are  expected  to  make  the  participating \ncommunities  more  receptive  to  the  Project  and  better  prepared  to  benefit  from  it.  Once  JFPR \nactivities are determined to be sustainable, they will be replicated under the Project.  \n \n22. \nGiven  the  nature  of  activities  in  the  watershed  management  component,  only \nrepresentative  core  subprojects  (subwatersheds)  were  identified  to  prepare  full  feasibility \nstudies.19  During  project  implementation,  the  same  activities  can  be  expanded  to  more \nsubprojects by replicating the same approach. Other subprojects can be identified based on the \nselection  criteria  agreed  on  with  the  Government.  The  main  elements  of  the  selection  criteria \nare that (i) the subprojects should encompass a micro- or a subwatershed boundary, (ii) at least \n25% of the population in each subproject district is below the poverty line, (iii) a subproject with \na  larger  degraded  land  area  is  preferred,  (iv)  ethnic  groups  and  women  will  have  equal \nopportunity  to  participate  in  the  Project,  and  (v)  an  initial  environmental  examination  of  the \nproposed  subproject  will  be  undertaken  to  ensure  that  the  proposed  project  activities  will  not \nhave any detrimental impact on the environment. \n \n23. \nFive core subprojects (subwatersheds) selected to initiate the investment activities of the \nwatershed management component include Nam Toum-Kha-Piang, Nam Xan, Nam Muay, Nam \nPha-Yen, and Nam Chia-Hao, covering 90 villages or 5,811 households with an estimated total \npopulation of 38,658. Total cultivated area is 4,520 hectares (ha) (or, 2% of the total cultivated \narea  of  NNRB),  of  which  3,000  ha  (66%)  is  lowland  rain-fed  rice.  Supplementary  wet-season \nirrigation supports only a small rice area of about 250 ha. The remaining area (about 1,270 ha) \nis  upland  mix  of  cash  crops,  vegetables,  and  fruit  trees.  Shifting  cultivation  is  practiced  on \nanother about 31,200 ha. \n \nDescription  of  the  Project  area,  development  strategy,  and  subproject  selection  criteria \n24. \nare in Appendix 6. The Project\u2019s development approach is consistent with the Government\u2019s 20-\nYear  Plan;  Five-Year  Socioeconomic  Development  Plan,  2001\u20132005;  and  Public  Investment \nProgram.20 The project\u2019s sector lending modality, in terms of area and time slice, supports the \nGovernment\u2019s development and public investment plans as laid out in the last two documents. \n \n\n1. \n\nIntegrated Water Resources Management \n\nIf  WRCC  is  to  be  a  viable  coordinating  agency  for  water  sector  management,  then  it \n25. \nmust  have  a  clear  action  plan  based  on  its  mandate  and  priority  IWRM  functions,  as  well  as \ncontinued support aimed at strengthening its role and capacity. The WRCC's Mandate indicates \nthat it is to study, monitor, coordinate, and advise in a number of important water-related areas \nsuch  as  policy  and  legislation  development,  information  management,  water  resources \nplanning,  human  resource  development,  and  public  awareness.  It  should  have  the  capacity  to \nmonitor and evaluate IWRM activities and to guide other water management agencies towards \n\n                                                 \n19 In this Project, subproject and subwatershed are synonymous. The subproject will always encompass a hydraulic \n\nboundary of either a micro- or a subwatershed, depending on the land slope. \n\n20 The 20-Year Plan is the Government\u2019s exit strategy from the status of least-developed country by 2020. The goal of \nthis  plan  is  being  pursued  through  eight  national  socio-economic  priority  programs.  The  Five-Year  Plan  is  the \nplanning cornerstone and translates the policies of the Party Congress into targets and objectives for sectors and \nregions. These targets reflect the eight priority national programs, with poverty reduction and food self-sufficiency \ntopping the list. The Public Investment Program is a component of the Five-Year Plan and it lists the investment \nprojects contained in various sector programs.  \n\n\f8 \n\na  more  holistic  approach  to  water  management.  This  component  will  incorporate  the  following \nactivities:  (i)  development  of  an  updated  WRCC  Action  Plan  and  development  and \nimplementation  of  a  WRCC  capacity  building  plan;  (ii)  policy  and  legislation  development \n(including  regulations  and  guidelines  for  addressing  key  water  management  issues  and \nimplementing river basin plans); (iii) data and information management (including development \nof  a  coordinated  national  water  resources  data  management  and  sharing  system);  (iv)  water \nresources planning coordination (including a coordinated planning approach involving HPO and \nIWMU  and  consultation  with  stakeholders);  (v)  training  (including  training  needs  assessment, \nplanning, coordination and evaluation for IWRM across the Project components); and  (vi) public \nawareness and consultation (including development and implementation of a public awareness \nstrategy).  Achievement of these objectives and development of the related capacity in WRCCS \nwill help ensure that the WRCC is seen as a valuable, effective, and sustainable water sector \ncoordinating agency at both the central as well as the river basin level. \n \n\n2. \n\nReservoir Management and River Basin Modeling \n\nThis  component  will  strengthen  the  capacity  of  HPO,  and  other  relevant  agencies,  to  \n26. \noptimize water resources in NNRB in general and the improve management of NN-1 reservoir in \nparticular.  A  review  of  current  operations  of  NN-1  will  consider  two  aspects:  (i)  long  term \noperational  planning  for  hydropower  generation,  based  on  optimized  sharing  of  the  water \nresources for various uses, given improved knowledge of expected inflows; and (ii) short term \noperational planning in the wet season to reduce downstream flood damages, given improved \ninflow forecasting and increased knowledge of downstream conditions. The expected output of \nthis component will include: (i) ability of relevant agencies to adopt planning tools to define the \nfuture  operation  of  the  NN-1  reservoir  under  actual  hydrological  conditions;  (ii)  increased \nknowledge  of  various  stakeholders  in  NNRB  on  available  water  resources,  their  optimum  use \nand the economic benefits; (iii) increased readiness for flood mitigation in downstream areas of \nNNRB,  and  (iv)  tools  to  negotiate  and  allocate  bulk  water  shares  for  different  users  under  the \nWater Law. It is expected that this component will change the operation of NN-1 reservoir from \nmainly hydropower generating scheme to an integrated utility that will carry out improved flood \nmitigation and better maintenance of downstream riverine ecosystem. \n\n   \nThis component will develop: (i) a Nam Ngum River basin model for long- and short term \n27. \noperational  planning  flexible  enough  to  quantify  impacts  of  large-scale  changes  in  watershed \nland use, significant irrigation developments, and implementation of other hydropower schemes \nin NNRB; (ii) a geographical information system based on hydrodynamic model of the Vientiane \nPlain  to  understand  relationship  between  flows  in  Nam  Ngum  River  and  the  water  level  in  the \nMekong  River;  and  (iii)  an  economic  model  to  estimate  benefits  of  IWRM  and  the  impact  of \nexpected changes in the operation of NN-1 reservoir. \n \n\n3. \n\nWatershed Management  \n\n28. \nThe outputs of this component can be divided into two broad categories. One output will \nstrengthen  the  capacity  of  the  IWMU.  The  other,  which  entails  the  most  extensive  investment \nactivities  of  the  Project,  will  provide  effective  agricultural  extension  support  to  upland \ncommunities.  At  the  national  level,  the  extension  activities  will  be  planned  by  the  newly \nreorganized MAF department, National Agricultural and Forestry Extension Service (NAFES).21 \n                                                 \n21  Under  the  old  set-up,  individual  departments  of  MAF\u2014irrigation,  agriculture,  livestock  and  fisheries,  and  forestry \nhad their own extension units. This fractured set-up was inefficient and could not take advantage of economies of \nscale.  All  the  departments\u2019  human  and  material  resources  have  now  been  pooled  under  NAFES.  For  farming \ncommunities, it will be a one-stop-shop for all types of agricultural extension services.  \n\n\f \n\n9 \n\nIn  the  field,  the  implementation  of  extension  activities  will  take  place  through  Provincial \nAgricultural  and  Forestry  Services  (PAFSs)  and  the  District  Agricultural  and  Forestry  Offices \n(DAFOs).  By  reorganizing  its  agricultural  extension  delivery  system  through  NAFES  in  August \n2001,  the  Government  recognizes  that  under-resourced  and  ineffective  extension  service  was \nthe  weak  link  in  efforts  to  promote  rural  development  while  ensuring  sustainable  watershed \nmanagement.  Historically,  the  average  budgetary  allocation  of  about  95:5  for  hardware  and \nsoftware  activities,  was  skewed  in  favor  of  infrastructure  development,  i.e.,  construction  of \noffices  and  irrigation  schemes.  The  main  thrust  of  this  component  is  to  support  the  new \ngovernment policy, which emphasizes improving delivery of appropriate agricultural technology \nto local communities.  \n \n29. \nThe  design  of  this  component  has  benefited  from  lessons  learned  under  numerous \nsimilar  projects  in  the  country.  From  the  extension  efforts  of  the  United  States  Agency  for \nInternational Development in the 1960s and 1970s to the Pilot Extension Project\u2019s activities in \nthe  1990s,  the  main  lessons  learned  are  (i)  adoption  will  be  slow  and  modest;  (ii)  new \ntechniques must blend in with cultural, environmental, farm, and market realities; and (iii) regular \ncommunity-based  training  in  the  local  language  with  hands-on  demonstration  is  necessary  to \nshow  results.  Although  results  from  many  irrigation  project  areas22  are  encouraging  but  the \nbeneficiaries  there  enjoy  better  input/output  markets  and  access  to  improved  infrastructure. \nTherefore,  under  this  Project,  only  modest  targets  have  been  set  for  the  upper  basin \nsubprojects.  The  Lao-International  Rice  Research  Institute  (Lao-IRRI)  has  nine  high  yielding \nvarieties  (HYVs)  suited  to  these  areas  and  which  do  not  require  chemical  fertilizes  and/or \npesticides.  The  target  farmers  will  raise  their  rice  yields  to  meet  food  shortages  rather  than \nproduce  rice  for  the  market.  Given  Lao-IRRI\u2019s  appropriate  technology  package,  modest \nexpected  yield  improvements  (0.5  t/ha),  chronic  food  shortages,  and  intensive  training  in  local \nlanguages, the extension activities under the Project will most likely succeed. \n \n30. \nCapacity Building in the IWMU. The IWMU helps MAF manage watersheds and plan \nthe  experiences  and \nrural  development  by  subwatershed.  The  activity  will  build  on \nachievements of Phase-1 financed by DANIDA,23 with an emphasis on IWRM. Under phase-1, \nan integrated planning approach to watershed management is being developed in consultation \nwith  pilot  provinces  and  districts  with  field-test  activities  undertaken  in  Feuang  District  of \nVientiane  Province.  The  bottom-up  approach  is  also  being  tried  out  in  eight  villages  in  two \ndistricts  of  Xieng  Khouang  and  Hua  Phan  provinces  and  in  the  Nam  Et  Phou  Loi  National \nBiodiversity Conservation Area Project. The aim of this activity strongly supports IWRM similar \nto that of the WRCC.  \n \n31. \nThe  IWMU  is  still  evolving  in  function  and  capacity.  Its  constraints  included  (i) \nunderdeveloped  operational  guidelines,  (ii)  inadequately  trained  human  resources,  (iii)  weak \ninter-agency collaboration for natural resources planning, (iv) ineffective system of management \nand  data  sharing,  (v)  little  integration  of  environmental  concerns  in  sector  planning,  and  (vi) \nweak provincial- and district-level capacity that hampered the preparation of good-quality local \ndevelopment plans and activities. The expected outputs of this activity will include (i) training of a \ncore  staff  at  the  central  level  capable  of  helping  the  WRCC  draft  a  framework  approach  to \nIWRM in rural development, (ii) preparation and adoption of 16 watershed plans in NNBC, and \n(iii) establishment of an integrated natural resource information system. \n\n                                                 \n22 Loan 1488-LAO: Community-Managed Irrigation Sector Project, for $15.0 million, approved in 1997, has supported \n\n44 schemes in five provinces. Rice productivity has, on average increased, from 2.0 t/ha to 3.5 t/ha.   \n\n23 DANIDA  was originally supportive of phase 2 until the agency\u2019s overall policy to projects in Laos was revised in \n\n2002 following a change of government in Denmark. \n\n\f10 \n\n \n32. \nIntegrated  Agricultural  Extension.  Of  the  Government\u2019s  agricultural  system  services, \nextension  is  the  weakest.  Over  the  last  10  years,  a  number  of  projects  have  prepared  and \ndelivered  appropriate  agricultural  technology  packages.  Lao-IRRI  has  helped  the  country \nachieve  rice  self-sufficiency.  The  forage  technology  developed  by  the  International  Center  for \nTropical  Agriculture  can  be  effective  in  raising  livestock  productivity.  Appropriate  technological \npackages for fruit tree and vegetable production, animal health, village forestry, and nontimber \nforest products (NTFP) are available and can be delivered to farming communities, along with \nappropriate training, to considerably raise their productivity and incomes. However, agricultural \nextension  service  significantly  lacks  human  resources,  technical  material,  and  delivery \nmechanisms.  The  project  activities  of  agricultural  extension  will  help  NAFES,  PAFSs,  and \nDAFOs serve the target villages and communities in selected subprojects. The service package \nwill  be  prepared  based  on  target  villages\u2019  needs  and  the  water  resource  environment.  For \ninstance,  some  villages  may  need  assistance  to  improve  crops  and  livestock  but  not  fisheries \nand  forestry,  while  others  may  need  help  with  village  forestry  and/or  NTFP  and  livestock. \nTherefore, extension activities should be flexible to serve local communities based on the nature \nof their livelihood systems.  \n \n33. \nCrop  Productivity  Improvement.  Agriculture  consumes  more  water  than  any  other \nsector in the economy. The sector is highly dependent on access to and supply of water. Water \nis critical for irrigated agriculture and for diversification of non-rice cash crops in the dry season. \nWater  management  for  agriculture,  therefore,  is  of  critical  importance  not  only  for  day-to-day \ncrop production but also for farming systems, livelihood strategies, and poverty reduction. \n \nIn NNRB in general and its uplands in particular, crop productivity is low due to farmers\u2019 \n34. \nlack of access to (i) appropriate training; and (ii) timely and adequate basic inputs, i.e., fertilizers \nand HYV seeds. Improved productivity, especially of rice, will (i) reduce poverty, as most upland \nhouseholds  face  rice  shortages  for  3\u20134  months  a  year;  (ii)  release  labor  and  land  for  other \nincome-generating  activities;  and  (iii)  minimize  environmental  impact  by  containing  shifting \ncultivation  and  forest  encroachment.  The  main  thrust  of  this  extension  effort  will  be  in  wet- \nseason rice areas where the current rice yield of 1.5 t/ha can be increased to 2.0 t/ha. Upland \nareas  can  also  diversify  into  vegetable  production.  The  development  of  orchards  on  sloping \nlands  will  stabilize  soil  and  also  reduce  shifting  cultivation.  The  long-term  goal  is  to  convert \nupland shifting rice cultivation into orchards (mango, tamarind, citrus, and banana).Vegetables, \nincluding cabbage, beans, and garlic, can be grown on the lower slopes. \n \nLivestock  and  Fishery  Improvement.  Livestock  is  central  to  the  livelihood  security  of \n35. \nresource-poor farmers in the upland areas, where most poor ethnic groups live. Several PRAs \nunder  this  as  well  as  other  projects  have  repeatedly  demonstrated  that  livestock  is \nindispensable as a rural social safety net.24 The livestock subsector is beset by high morbidity \nand mortality rates, 40\u201350% or higher, and lack of access to appropriate forage technology. The \nProject will provide (i) extension service to manage cattle, buffalo, and small livestock (pigs and \npoultry);  (ii)  farmer-based  disease  control  and  vaccination  programs;  (iii)  a  village-based \nextension  program  emphasizing  training  of  female  livestock  farmers;  and  (iv)  better  linkages \nwith the market. Improved livestock feed will be ensured by introducing appropriate forage and \nother  feed  technologies  coupled  with  managed  rather  than  the  more  common  free-range \ngrazing. The Project will also help (i) establish subwatershed livestock management committees \nby building on existing rural institutions but ensuring that hitherto excluded groups (women and \nethnic groups) participate, (ii) initiate pilot programs in schools to develop greater awareness of \n\n                                                 \n24 ADB. 2001.

Manila. \n\n\f \n\n11 \n\nwatershed management issues, and (iii) send study tours of extension workers and community \nleaders to other subwatersheds in the NNRB and elsewhere in the country. \n \n36. \nFish  is  an  important  source  of  protein  for  rural  households  throughout  the  country. \nHowever,  fish  farming  beyond  subsistence  requires  a  good  transportation  system,  a  well-\ndeveloped market, and cold-storage facilities. Since these are not available, the Project will not \nattempt to generate a large surplus of farmed fish. Instead, the Project will help realize a modest \nincrease  in  fish  farming  to  improve  nutrition  through  community-based  extension  activities. \nCollaborating  with  and  building  upon  the  experience  of  FAO-UNDP\u2019s  Provincial  Aquaculture \nDevelopment  Project,  the  Project  will  continue  decentralizing  hatcheries,  extending  fish \ntechnology  to  the  villages,  and  helping  form  and  train  fish  farmers\u2019  groups  in  existing \ncommunity-based management groups (e.g., water users associations). \n \n37. \nForest  Restoration  and  Sustainable  Land  Use.  Forests  are  an  integral  part  of \nlivelihoods  of  local  communities  and  the  rural  poor,  a  major  source  of  revenue  for  the \ngovernment,  and  play  an  important  role  in  maintaining  land  productivity  and  regulating  water \nyields in NNRB. Forests provide for important subsistence needs of fuelwood and timber for the \nrural  households,  and  NTFPs  contribute  up  to  50-60%  of  the  rural  household  income.  NTFPs \nare  a  critical  resource  for  the  rural  poor  for  meeting  their  food  security  needs,  and  act  as  a \nsafety net during natural or economic crises. It is estimated that NTFP exports, mainly to PRC, \nThailand, and Vietnam generate over $6 million a year; or about 2% of total national exports. To \nmeet  the  demands  of  an  increasing  and  relatively  more  prosperous  population,  increasing  the \nsupply  of  fuelwood,  timber,  and  NTFPs  is  essential  for  protecting  the  watershed.  To  achieve \nthese  objectives,  the  Project  will  undertake:  (i)  preparation  of  NNRB  forest  resource \ndevelopment strategy, (ii) rehabilitate and restore 9,000 ha of natural forests with less than 40% \ncrown  density,  and  (iii)  build  capacity  of  extension  workers,  communities  and  beneficiaries  for \nsustainable forest use and management.  \n \nCurrent forest classification is neither based on sound forestry principles nor transparent \n38. \npractices.  This  results  in  inappropriate  allocation  of  capital  and  labor  resources  and \nunsustainable  forest  utilization.  The  Project  will  upgrade  the  forest  land-use  classification \nmethodology  and  information  base  for  the  NNRB,  and  prepare  a  5  to15  year  NNRB  forest \nresource  development  strategy  and  management  plans.  The  strategy  will  aim  at  optimizing \nwater  yields,  improving  livelihood,  and  ensuring  food  security  for  the  upland  communities. \nForest  management  plans  for  selected  watersheds  will:  (i)  delineate  management  units  and \nprescribe  forest  restoration  and  production  areas,  (ii)  identify  silvicultural  and  sustainable \nmanagement regimes for timber and NTFPs, (iii) identify harvesting technologies and marketing \nstrategies, and (iv) identify appropriate institutional arrangements. \n \n39. \nThe  Project  will  use  framework  species  technology  for  restoring  3,500  ha  of  degraded \nnatural forest area with crown cover ranging between 20-40%. Using agroforestry technologies, \nthe Project will improve forest condition and production of timber and NTFPs over 5,500 ha of \nstate and commune forest lands. Individual and/or groups of households will be involved in this \nactivity.25 Moreover, both modern and indigenous technologies will be used in implementing this \ncomponent.  Project  will  strengthen  and  upgrade  forest  resource  planning,  restoration,  and \nmanagement  capacities  of  the  concerned  line  agencies;  Project  area  communities;  and \n                                                 \n25  Framework  species  approach  economies  on  time  and  material  inputs  by  using  a  selected  and  critical  number  of \noriginal and/or indigenous tree species as building blocks for accelerating forest recovery and regeneration. Agro-\nforestry involves growing of trees and agricultural crops on the same unit of land, at the same time or in sequence, \nwith the dual purpose of establishing a permanent tree cover, and improving local farming systems for increased \nfood and subsistence security. \n\n\f12 \n\nparticipating  beneficiaries.  Capacity  building  activities  will  include:  (i)  on-hands  training  in \nparticipatory  forest  resource  management  planning,  (ii)  nursery  technology  and  management, \n(iii)  forest  rehabilitation  and  restoration  technologies,  (iv)  sustainable  timber  and  NTFP \nharvesting, (v) and marketing. These activities will benefit over 6,000 households, restore over \n9,000 ha of degraded natural forests, and generate over 1.65 million labor days of employment. \n \n40. \nThe proposed interventions have a good potential to succeed in the uplands especially \nin  degraded  parts  of  the  subwatersheds.  The  World  Conservation  Union\u2019s  NTFP  pilot  project, \nin  1995\u20132000  was \nSupporting \nimplemented in conjunction with the National Agriculture and Forestry Research Institute in 12 \nvillages  of  Oudamxai,  Champassak,  and  Salavan  provinces.  The  project  demonstrated  that \nNTFPs have a great potential to: (i) reduce poverty by raising food security; (ii) ensure gender \nand  social  equity;  (iii)  conserve  forests,  biodiversity,  and  watersheds;  and  (iv)  develop \nsustainable forest-based commerce and industry.  \n \nC. \n\nthe  Sustainable  Use  of  Non-Timber  Forest  Products, \n\nSpecial Features \n\n1. \n\nPoverty, Ethnicity, and Gender in the Nam Ngum River Basin \n\n41. \nThe  Government  considers  a  person  as  poor  who  does  not  have  access  to  2,100 \nkilocalories  per  day,  which  is  roughly  the  equivalent  of  an  income  of  $11.20  per  capita  per \nmonth. This is much lower than the World Bank\u2019s universal definition of poverty line\u2014$1 per day \nper  capita.  The  rural  poverty  line  is  considered  15\u201330%  lower  than  the  urban  poverty  line.  In \nNNRB, approximately 201,600 persons live in poverty. While the average poverty level in NNRB \nis  28.1%,  which  is  lower  than  the  national  average  of  39%,  upland  ethnic  groups  suffer  much \ndeeper poverty. The Hmong and Yao are the poorest, followed by the Khmou and the Tai. The \nlowland  Lao  are  the  least  likely  to  be  poor.  The  highest  poverty  gap  is  found  in  Xaisomboun \nSpecial  Zone  followed  by  Xiang  Khouang  Province.  Sex  ratios  are  high  in  rural  NNRB  and \nwomen  outnumber  men  by  approximately  10%.  Women  also  suffer  from  poverty  in  gender- \nspecific  ways.  Poverty  for  women  means  having  a  greater  work  burden,  poorer  health,  lower \neducation levels, less food, and inadequate rest than men. Dependency ratios are high implying \nthat for poor ethnic households, large families are part of strategies to deal with poverty. Chronic \nfood  shortages  are  common:  rice  shortages  for  3\u20135  months  were  reported  during  PRAs  and \ncase studies. The main causes of food shortages were reported as (i) reduced access to land \nfor  upland  agriculture,  (ii)  lack  of  forest  resources,  and  (iii)  inadequate  income  from  NTFPs. \nLand  and  forest  allocations  were  stated  to  be  unfair  to  the  poor.  Ethnic  groups  face  social \nexclusion  in  various  forms,  including  language  barriers  faced  by  schoolchildren  and  adults, \nparticularly women. The lack of trust arises out of histories of antagonism. Ethnic groups mostly \npractice  shifting  cultivation,  considered  detrimental  to  the  environment,  which  the  Government \nseeks to discourage. Ethnic groups see the policy as disregard for their knowledge of production \nsystems unique to their environment.  \n \n42. \nThe  Project  will  address  the  primary  concerns  of  the  poor,  including  food  security, \nsustainability of livelihoods, and access to productive resources. Communities will be organized \ninto  groups  so  they  can  access  better  agricultural  technologies  through  appropriate  and \ninclusive  training  and  extension  services.  Land  and  forest  allocations  will  be  carried  out  in  full \nconsultation  with  poor  communities.  Mass  organizations  and  nongovernment  organizations \n(NGOs)  will  work  with  PAFSs  and  DAFO  officials  to  organize  community-based  groups  and \nimpart training and provide extension support. Summary poverty reduction and social strategy is \nin Appendix 7. \n\n\f \n\n13 \n\n2. \n\nEthnic Groups\u2019 Development Plan in the Nam Ngum River Basin \n\n43. \nOver half the potential project beneficiaries belong to smaller ethnic groups. The Hmong \nare the largest group (65.5%), followed by the Khmou (31.4%), and the Yao (2.1%). The Hmong \nare also the poorest. Under the Project, an ethnic groups\u2019 development plan (EGDP) has been \nprepared  to  provide  socially  inclusive  strategies  ensuring  that  ethnic  groups  benefit  equitably. \nThe  Government  has  set  up  the  Lao  Front  for  National  Construction  (LFNC)  to  ensure  that \nethnic  groups  fully  participate  in  national  social,  economic,  and  political  activities.  LFNC \nrepresentatives  are  present  in  all  ethnic  villages  and  will  play  a  critical  role  in  facilitating  their \nparticipation  in  project  activities.  LFNC  will  be  represented  on  the  national  project  steering \ncommittee.  MAF  will  recruit  a  full-time  specialist  with  expertise  in  ethnicity  issues  who  will \ncoordinate EGDP implementation. To solve problems of poverty and exclusion, EGDP activities \nwill  include  (i)  training  and  sensitization  of  PAFS  and  DAFO  staff,  (ii)  production  of  culturally \nappropriate  training  material  in  ethnic  languages  and  (iii)  organization  of  ethnic  groups  for \nparticipatory training, extension support, and benefit monitoring. \n \n\n3. \n\nGender Issues and Gender Action Plan \n\n44.  Women constitute most of the poor farmers in NNRB. Over 85% of women live and work \nin  farming  households,  where  they  have  greater  responsibilities  than  men  for  production  and \nreproductive  work.  Women  spend  longer  hours  (i)  working  in  upland  agriculture;  (ii)  collecting \nNTFP for processing, consumption, and sale; (iii) raising small livestock for consumption and for \ncash income; and (iv) manufacturing handicrafts for cash income. Women also perform the bulk \nof  household  work  with  the  help  of  children  particularly  girls.  Girls  and  women  have  limited \neducation  opportunities.  Women  have  little  or  no  land  rights,  particularly  among  the  ethnic \ncommunities,  which  are  patriarchal.  The  Project  has  prepared  a  gender  action  plan  that  will \nprovide  for  the  following    (i)  the  WRCC  recruit  women  for  a  minimum  of  30%  of  technical \npositions;  (ii)  WRCC,  HPO,  MAF,  PAF,  and  DAFO  staff  will  undergo  mandatory  gender \nsensitization  training;  (iii)  at  least  30%  of  DAFO  extension  staff  will  be  women;  (iv)  women\u2019s \ngroups  will  be  organized  for  project  activities;  (iv)  at  least  50%  of  all  training  program \nparticipants will be women; (v) training programs will be designed to suit the needs of women \nfarmers; (vi) women will form 50% of project beneficiaries; (vii) women beneficiaries will receive \njoint/single  titles  to  land  and  forest  resources;  and  (viii)  women\u2019s  groups    will  undertake \nparticipatory  evaluation  of  training  and  extension  programs  in  association  with  mass \norganizations, NGOs, and DAFO staff. \n \n\n4. \n\nEnvironmental Issues and Monitoring \n\n45. \nAn  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE)  has  determined  that  the  Project  will  provide \nsustainable livelihood opportunities to local communities and lessen human pressure on critical \nwatersheds.  The  IEE  also  indicates  that  the  environmental  impacts  arising  from  the  Project\u2019s \nconstruction  and  operation  activities  will  be  minor  and  can  be  minimized  to  acceptable  levels \nusing  mitigation  measures.  Therefore,  the  Project  has  been  classified  as  environmental \ncategory  B.  A  sample  IEE  for  a  core  subproject,  Nam  Toum-Kha-Piang  in  Xieng  Khouang \nProvince,  was  undertaken  in  detail  (Appendix  8).  A  summary  IEE  for  the  whole  Project, \nincluding an environmental management plan (EMP), has also been prepared (Supplementary \nAppendix D). Project implementation guidelines require that a detailed IEE report be prepared \nfor  each  remaining  subproject  and  submitted  to  the  environmental  authorities  for  approval \nbefore initiating any project activities. \n \n\n\f14 \n\nTo  ensure  that  all  applicable  national  and  provincial  environmental  laws,  regulations, \n46. \nstandards,  and  ADB  environmental  requirements  are  met  during  project  implementation,  an \nEMP has been prepared. It will be carried out by Office of the National Project Manager (ONPM) \nin coordination with all the Project Implementation Units (PIUs). The Government has assured \nthat the mitigation measures identified in IEEs will be incorporated into the design, construction, \nand  operation  of  the  Project.  An  environment  unit,  staffed  by  an  environment  officer  and  a \nrepresentative  from  the  Science,  Technology,  and  Environment  Agency  (STEA),  will  be \nestablished in the ONPM. Each PIU will also be staffed by one environment officer. The ONPM \nand  PIUs  will  monitor  mitigation  measures  and  submit  quarterly  project  progress  reports  and \nannual environmental monitoring reports to STEA and ADB.   \n \nD. \n\nCost Estimates \n\n47. \nThe project cost, including contingencies, taxes, and duties, is estimated at $23 million \nequivalent, consisting of a foreign exchange cost of $9.4 million (41%) and local currency cost \nof $13.6 million (59%) equivalent. Detailed cost estimates are in Table A9.1, Appendix 9. \n \nE. \n\nFinancing Plan \n\n48. \nADB will provide a loan of $15 million equivalent to finance 65% of the total project cost. \nThe Government will contribute $4.2 million equivalent (18%) in local currency and in-kind costs. \nAgence  Francaise  de  Developpement  (AFD)  will  provide  $3.8  million  (17%)  equivalent  as  a \ngrant in parallel cofinancing. Detailed financing plans are in Tables A9.2 and A9.3, Appendix 9. \nThe JFPR project will provide about $2 million for its own activities in addition to the Project\u2019s \noverall financing. \n \nF. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n1. \n\nProject Management \n\nfor \n\ntheir  respective  activities \n\n49.  MAF  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  for  the  Project.  The  ONPM,  headed  by  a  National \nProject Manager, has been established in MAF\u2019s Department of Planning. PIUs in WRCC, HPO, \nand  NAFES,  headed  by  their  respective  Project  Coordinators,  have  also  been  established. \nWRCC, HPO, and NAFES will be the implementation agencies for their respective components. \nthe  watershed  management  component,  NAFES,  PAFS,  and  DAFOs  will  be \nUnder \nimplementation  agencies \nthe  Government\u2019s \ndecentralization  policy.  The  project  imprest  account  will  be  established  at  the  ONPM  and \nsecond-generation  imprest  accounts  will  be  established  at  PIUs  and  the  provincial  level.  A \nproject  steering  committee  (PSC),  headed  by  the  Vice  Minister,  MAF,  and  comprising  one \nmember  each,  at  the  director  general\u2019s  level,  from  WRCC,  MAF,  MIH,  Ministry  of  Finance \n(MOF), Committee for Planning and Cooperation (CPC), Lao Women\u2019s Union, and LFNC; and \nrepresentatives  of  NNRBC  will  be  established.  NNRBC  representatives  will  comprise  the \nrespective vice governors (or equivalent officials) of Vientiane Province, Vientiane Municipality, \nXieng Khouang Province, and Xaisomboun Special Zone. A project procurement committee will \nbe established, headed by the director general, Department of Planning, MAF, and comprising \none  representative  each  from  the  WRCC,  MIH,  MOF,  and  CPC.  Key  positions  of  counterpart \nstaff and outline terms of reference of Government offices and committees are in Appendix 10. \n \n\nline  with \n\nin \n\n\f \n\n15 \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Period \n\n50. \nThe  implementation  period  will  be  6  years  (2003\u20132008).  The  first  year  will  focus  on \nestablishing the necessary management systems, including those for procurement, accounting, \ndisbursement,  and  Project  Performance  Management  System  (PPMS)  at  the  ONPM  at  MAF \nand  the  WRCCS.  The  WRCC  and  HPO  components  will  start  right  after  loan  effectiveness. \nOnce  these  systems  are  in  place,  the  technical  activities  of  the  watershed  management \ncomponent will build capacity in the central and provincial training units and rehabilitate selected \nDAFOs  and  then  train  their  extension  workers,  who  will  then  conduct  on-farm  trials  and  train \nfarming communities for the rest of the Project. The implementation schedule is in Appendix 10. \n \n\n3. \n\nProcurement \n\n51. \nGoods  and  services  financed  from  the  ADB  loan  will  be  procured  in  accordance  with \nADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Procurement.  Vehicles,  equipment,  civil  works,  and  materials  will  be \nprocured  by  international  competitive  bidding  where  the  cost  is  valued  at  more  than  $500,000 \nequivalent,  or  by  international  shopping  where  the  cost  is  valued  from  $100,000  to  $500,000 \nequivalent.  Where  several  local  suppliers  can  offer  satisfactory  service  facilities,  vehicles, \nequipment, civil works, and materials valued at less than $100,000 equivalent may be procured \nunder  local  competitive  bidding  procedures,  or  through  direct  purchase.  Final  details  for \nprocurement  will  be  determined  during  project  implementation  as  appropriate.  To  commence \nthe  Project  on  time,  ADB  has  approved,  at  the  Government\u2019s  request,  an  advance  action  for \nprocurement\u2014AFD will consider the same. The Government has been advised that approval of \nsuch advance action does not commit ADB to finance any part of the Project.  \n \n\n4. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n52. \nConsulting  services  are  required  for  project  management  and  a  number  of  technical \ninputs.  About  239  person-months  of  international  and  413  person-months  of  domestic \nconsulting services will be required to support project implementation and capacity building. The \nconsulting  services  will  be  recruited  in  two  packages.  ADB  will  finance  one  package  of  137 \nperson-months  of \ninternational  and  201  person-months  of  domestic  consultants.  An \ninternational  firm,  in  association  with  a  domestic  firm,  will  be  engaged  to  provide  the  required \nsupport as per ADB Guidelines for the Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory \nto ADB for engaging domestic consultants. AFD will finance, in parallel, another package of 102 \nperson-months  of  international  and  212  person-months  of  domestic  consulting  services. \nConsultants for this package will be recruited as per AFD procedures. The amount of consulting \nservices  identified  under  the  Project  is  considered  necessary  in  view  of  the  Government\u2019s \nlimited human resource capacity and technical expertise at all levels. Specialists will be required \nto introduce new technology through the Project and build capacity of project staff. \n \n53. \nAlthough  AFD  will  finance  a  large  portion  of  the  consulting  services,  ADB  will  finance  \nthe  position  of  the  team  leader  and  other  key  consultants.  All  consultants  will  be  required  to \nwork under the team leader following specific terms of reference for each individual consultant \nbased  on  a  consolidated  work  plan.  This  arrangement  will  ensure  unified  coordination  for  the \nproject implementation. A similar arrangement under an ongoing ADB-AFD cofinanced Project \nis  working  out  smoothly.26  Outline  terms  of  reference  and  details  of  both  consulting  packages \nare in Appendix 11. \n\n                                                 \n26  ADB.  2000.  Technical  Assistance  on  Decentralized  Irrigation  Management  and  Development  Sector  Project. \n\nManila. \n\n\f16 \n\n5. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n54. \nTo expedite disbursements, MOF, under its new rules and regulations, will allow MAF to \nestablish  a  project  imprest  account  operated  by  the  ONPM.  Second-generation  imprest \naccounts will be established in each PIU. These accounts will be used to meet eligible project \nexpenditures  incurred  by  ONPM,  PIUs,  and  IAs.  Each  imprest  account  will  be  managed  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook  (January  2001).  The  initial  combined \ntotal amount in all imprest accounts will not exceed 6 months of estimated expenditures and not \nmore than 10% of the loan amount. ADB\u2019s statement of expenditure procedures will be followed \nto  reimburse  expenditures  and  liquidate  imprest  accounts  for  payments  below  the  ceiling  of \n$50,000.  The  Government\u2019s  attention  is  called  to  ADB\u2019s  anticorruption  policy,  particularly  the \nsection on fraud and corruption, as stated in ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement and Guidelines \non the Use of Consultants. \n \n\n6. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\nPIUs  will  provide  the  ONPM  with  concise  quarterly  reports  during  each  year  of \n55. \nimplementation,  describing  (i)  physical  and  financial  progress  against  agreed  targets,  (ii) \ndisbursement of counterpart funds at provincial and/or district levels, and (iii) summary of PPMS \nresults.  In  turn,  the  ONPM  will  submit  consolidated  quarterly  and  comprehensive  annual \nprogress  reports  to  MAF  for  onward  submission  to  the  Government,  ADB,  and  AFD.  Within  3 \nmonths of project completion, the ONPM will prepare a project completion report in the standard \nADB format and submit it to the Government, ADB, and AFD. \n \nThe ONPM and PIUs will maintain separate records and accounts adequate to identify \n56. \nthe  goods  and  services  financed  from  loan  proceeds,  financing  resources  received,  project \nexpenditures,  and  use  of  local  funds.  Accounts  will  be  established  and  maintained  in \naccordance  with  generally  accepted  accounting  principles  and  following  MOF  guidelines  and \nprocedures as amended from time to time. Consolidated project accounts and related financial \nstatements  will  be  compiled  by  the  ONPM  and  audited  annually  by  independent  external \nauditors  acceptable  to  ADB.  The  audited  accounts,  audit  reports,  and  related  financial \nstatements will be submitted to ADB not later than 9 months after the end of the fiscal year to \nwhich they relate. \n \n\n7. \n\nProject Monitoring and Evaluation \n\nProject Performance Management will be undertaken for each component to ensure that \n57. \nProject  resources  are  managed  efficiently  and  benefits  realized.  The  ONPM  will  develop  a \ncomprehensive  PPMS  with  assistance  from  project  management  consultants.  The  PPMS  will \ninclude  a  participatory  mechanism  to  involve  beneficiaries  in  monitoring.  The  ONPM,  assisted \nby the PIUs, will be responsible for carrying out PPMS activities, including the establishment of \nbenchmarks  through  initial  baseline  physical  and  socioeconomic  surveys,  data  collection,  and \nanalysis.  The  ONPM  will  submit  a  detailed  PPMS  implementation  plan  to  prepare  benchmark \ninformation for ADB\u2019s review and concurrence within 6 months of loan effectiveness. The ONPM \nwill provide annual PPMS reports to ADB and AFD throughout project implementation. \n \n58. \nBefore project activities start, eight staff of the ONPM and PIUs will attend an intensive \n6-week  PPMS  training  course  at  the  Rural  Development  Institute  at  Khon  Kaen  University, \nThailand.  The  course  covers  (i)  baseline  survey  design  and  management  of  agricultural \ndevelopment projects, (ii) principles and methods of data and statistical analysis, and (iv) report \npreparation using tables and graphs. \n\n\f \n\n8. \n\nProject Review \n\n17 \n\n59. \nDuring  project  implementation,  ADB  will  carry  out  annual  reviews  assessing  the  (i) \nimplementation arrangements and their effectiveness; (ii) capacity-building activities and training \nprograms in the WRCCS, HPO, NAFES, IWMU, PAFSs, and DAFOs; (iii) progress of technical \ninterventions  at  the  village  level;  and  (iv)  acceptance  of  IWRM  in  the  overall  water  resources \nmanagement  system.  A  midterm  review  will  be  carried  out  in  year  3.  The  review  will  take  a \ncomprehensive stock of the Project implementation and determine whether it complies with the \noriginal design parameters and that intended benefits have begun to materialize. The midterm \nreview will also afford an opportunity to make any requisite refinements to the Project design. \n \n\n \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n\n1. \n\nProject Benefits and Impacts \n\n60. \nAt  the  national  level,  project  benefits  will  arise  from  optimal  use  of  water  resources  by \ninstitutionalizing  IWRM.  More  efficient  management  of  the  NN-1  reservoir  will  generate \nadditional hydropower, improve water conservation, and mitigate floods. Other benefits will stem \nfrom  the  efficient  use  of  water  in  agriculture  leading  to  increased  crop  productivity  and \nhousehold incomes. Adoption of improved land-use practices, in the upper basin, will maintain \nthe water quality in the long run. At the grassroots level, the watershed management component \nwill  target  poor  upland  areas,  and  major  beneficiary  groups  will  include  ethnic  groups  and \nwomen.  Through  crop  improvement,  livestock  and  fishery  management,  and  restoration \nforestry,  household  incomes  of  the  beneficiaries  will  increase  significantly  while  maintaining \nsustainable  livelihood  systems  and  the  environment.  Provision  of  sustainable  livelihood \nopportunities will ensure that forest degradation and shifting cultivation are stabilized to optimize \nwater  conservation.  Since  this  is  a  sector-type  project,  the  exact  impact  and  number  of \nbeneficiaries  cannot  be  determined  at  the  outset.  By  project  completion,  an  estimated  10,000 \nhouseholds in NNRB will have directly benefited from the Project of which more than 25% live \nbelow the poverty line. \n \n61. \nThe project benefits from investment interventions will flow from higher rice yields, lower \nmorbidity and mortality rates among livestock, better agroforestry, and sustainable harvesting of \nNTFPs. Improved rice yields and some crop diversification will encourage a reduction in shifting \ncultivation  on  the  upland  slopes,  optimize  water  usage  on  valley  floors,  and  allow  for  forest \nrestoration.  Restoration  forestry  ensures  sustainable  development,  and  thus  conserves \nbiodiversity. The main extension effort will focus on rain-fed rice production using the Lao-IRRI \npackage  of  improved  seed,  fertilizer  application,  and  better  farming  practices.  The  package  is \nexpected to be used on over 20,000 ha, producing an incremental 10,000 t of rice per season. \nNNRB  has  a  large  and  relatively  dense  animal  population,  especially  in  the  upper  basin. \nMorbidity and mortality rates in livestock are as high as 40\u201350% in many parts of NNRB. The \nproposed  livestock  intervention  will  significantly  reduce  health  risks  to  livestock  in  the  project \narea. By introducing better forage technology, weight value of average animal will increase by \n25%.  On  average,  NTFPs  provide  55%  of  household  cash  income.  Restoration  forestry  will \nraise  incomes  of  6,000  target  households.  Provision  of  alternative  livelihood  opportunities  will \nensure  that  forest  degradation,  on  about  30,000  ha,  is  stabilized  and  shifting  cultivation,  on \nanother  25,000  ha,  is  reduced  so  that  land-use  patterns  optimize  water  conservation. \nEnvironmental  benefits  will  arise  from  (i)  less  risk  to  the  range  lands  in  the  upper  basin  as  a \nresult  of  improved  animal  husbandry,  (ii)  more  stable  slopes  introduced  under  sloping-land \nagricultural technology, and (iii) cash and non-cash benefits from restoration forestry. \n \n\n\f18 \n\nEfficient  operation  of  the  NN-1  reservoir  will  provide  an  additional  2%  or  20  gigawatt \n62. \nhours  of  hydropower  (worth  $600,000)  per  year,  mitigate  floods,  and  improve  water \nconservation.  Through  crop  improvement,  livestock  and  fishery  management,  and  restoration \nforestry  household  incomes  will  increase  significantly  while  maintaining  sustainable  livelihood \nsystems  and  the  environment.  The  overall  annual  income  of  a  household  is  expected  to \nincrease  by  about  80%;  from  KN7,140,000  ($700)  to  KN12,954,000  ($1270).  The  non-cash \nincome is expected to increase from KN6,630,000 ($650) to KN9,537,000 ($935), an increase of \n34%, while the return per family day of labor would increase from KN5,000 ($0.49) per day to \nKN13,000 ($1.27) per day. It is expected that, on average, the annual cash income will increase \nby  5-6  fold;  from  KN510,000  ($50)  to  KN3,417,000  ($335).  Benefits  from  timber,  about  $40 \nmillion,  will  mature  in  year  20\u2014providing  an  additional  lump  sum  income  of  about  $6,600  per \nhousehold.  The  estimated  economic  internal  rate  of  return,  for  base  case,  is  24.7%  indicating \nsound  economic  viability  of  the  Project.  Detailed  methodology  and  results  of  financial  and \neconomic analyses are in Appendix 12. \n\n2. \n\nProject Risks \n\n63. \nThe  WRCC,  HPO,  NAFES,  and  IWMU  and  its  provincial  and  district  departments  are \nshort of human resources and receive inadequate budgetary allocations. Capacity building will \ndepend  on  finding  these  resources,  especially  for  the  WRCCS  and  HPO,  where  a  significant \nincrease in qualified technical staff is proposed. The investment interventions in agriculture and \nforestry depend on the capability of the provincial and district staff. The Project will build some \naspects of the agencies\u2019 capacity, but the success and sustainability of the project interventions \nwill  depend  largely  on  the  overall  ability  and  willingness  of  the  Government  to  plan  and \nimplement the interventions in cooperation with local authorities and communities. \n \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nA. \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\nIn addition to the standard assurances, the Government has given specific assurances \n\n64. \nthat will be incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nCounterpart  Funds.  All  counterpart  funds  for  project  implementation  will  be \nprovided  on  time.  The  Government  will  make  timely  submissions  of  annual \nbudgetary  appropriation \nrequests  and  ensure  prompt  disbursement  of \nappropriated funds during each year of project implementation. \nCounterpart Staff. The Government and ADB will review the effectiveness of the \nONPM\u2019s  activities  and  those  of  PIUs  in  the  WRCC,  HPO,  and  NAFES  1  year \nafter loan effectiveness and, if required, adopt improvement measures. \nSocial Issues: To ensure gender equity, active participation of poor and ethnic \ncommunities,  and  balanced  social  development  in  the  project  areas,  the \nGovernment  has  agreed  to  a  number  of  specific  assurances.  For  poverty \nreduction, the Project will (a) include at least 25% or more of poor farmers and \nrural producers in all project areas among its beneficiaries as well as members of \nall  producer/user  groups  to  be  formed  under  the  Project,  (b)  use  participatory \nvillage-based land and forest allocation for equitable and secure land allocation, \nand (c) adopt participatory poverty impact assessment and PPMS. For effective \nparticipation  of  ethnic  groups,  the  Project  will  ensure  that  (a)  all  PAFSs  and \nDAFOs  will  recruit  at  least  50%  of  extension  and  training  staff  from  among  all \nethnic groups, including 50% women; (b) all training and demonstrations in ethnic \n\n\f \n\n19\n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\ncommunity areas will be culturally compatible and suited to the particular needs \nof upland communities; and (c) ethnic groups will be organized into groups for all \nproject  activities  including  participatory  poverty  impact  assessment.  To  support \ngender equity in development, the Project will (a) carry out mandatory regular \ntraining  of  staff  of  participating  government  agencies  in  gender-responsive \ndevelopment; (b) recruit women for at least 30% of WRCCS technical positions, \nand support recruitment of women for all positions under the Project; (c) ensure \nthat at least 50% of all trainees in training programs are women; (d) ensure that \nwomen  constitute  at  least  30\u201350%  of  membership  of  producer  and/or  user \ngroups;  and  (e)  ensure  that  PPMS  is  gender  responsive.  To  support  social \ndevelopment,  the  Project  will  (a)  retain  the  services  of  an  international  social \ndevelopment  expert,  on  a  periodic  basis,  in  the  ONPM  to  support  all  activities \nrelated to ethnic group participation, and gender and development; and (b) recruit \na  full-time  domestic  social  development  specialist  for  the  ONPM  to  support  all \nsocial development activities. \nEnvironmental  Issues.  To  ensure  that  EMP  is  implemented  and  monitored \nsatisfactorily, an environment unit within the ONPM, with a member from STEA, \nwill  be  established  within  6  months  of  loan  effectiveness.  An  IEE  and/or \nenvironmental  impact  assessment  for  each  candidate  subproject  will  be \nprepared,  in  accordance  with  the  Government  and  ADB\u2019s  environmental \nguidelines  and  standards,  and  submitted  to  the  environmental  authorities \nconcerned  for  submission  to  ADB  for  its  approval  before  final  selection  of  the \nsubproject.  \nProject  Performance  Management  System.  The  Government  will  ensure  that \ndata  on  communities,  collected  while  prioritizing  targets,  will  serve  as  baseline \ninformation  for  PPMS  during  project  implementation.  Within  9  months  of  loan \neffectiveness,  ONPM,  with  support  of  project  management  consultants,  will \nestablish appropriate mechanisms and procedures for PPMS. \nExternal  Auditors,  Annual  Auditing,  and  Financial  Statements.  External \nauditors will be engaged to audit project accounts. The annual audited accounts \nand financial statements, together with audit reports, in English, will be submitted \nto ADB within 9 months following the end of the Government\u2019s fiscal year. \n\n \nB. \n\nConditions for Loan Effectiveness \n\n65. \nBefore  loan  effectiveness,  the  Government  will  have:  (i)  filled  key  administrative  and \ntechnical  positions  in  the  ONPM  and  PIU  at  NAFES/IWMU,  as  specified  in  Appendix  10,  and \nestablished  their  office  premises  appropriately;  and  (ii)  evaluated  bidding  proposals  for \nconsulting services under the ADB-package.  \n \n\nVI. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n66. \nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  loan  would  comply  with  ADB\u2019s  Articles  of  Agreement \nand  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to  Special \nDrawing Rights 11,341,000 to the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic for the Nam Ngum River \nBasin Development Sector Project from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources with an interest charge \nat the rate of 1% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter; a term of \n32  years,  including  a  grace  period  of  8  years;  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  as  are \nsubstantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  draft  Loan  Agreement  presented  to  the \nBoard. \n \n\nTADAO CHINO \nPresident \n\n21 October 2002 \n\n\f20 \n\nAppendix 1 \n\nPROJECT PROCESSING CHRONOLOGY \n\n \n1. \nIn response to a request from the Government of the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic \n(Lao PDR), the Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided technical assistance (TA) to prepare \nthe  Project.1  The  objective  of  the  TA  was  to  help  the  Government  introduce  integrated  water \nresources  management  (IWRM)  to  the  Nam  Ngum  River  Basin  by  (i)  preparing  a  river  basin \nresource  assessment  and  action  agenda  in  consultation  with  stakeholders,  formulating  a \nmedium-term  basin  management  strategy,  and  establishing  a  river  basin  organization;  and  (ii) \nformulating  a  water  resource  investment  project  with  components  that  focus  on  poverty \nreduction, environmental management, and institutional development. \n \n2. \nThe  consultant  was  mobilized  in  May  2001.  During  TA  implementation,  the  TA  review \nmission  in  November  2001  approached  the  Agence  Francaise  de  Developpement  (AFD)  and \ninvited them to become a partner in the Project especially to assist with the IWRM component. \nAFD considered the request and enlisted the Project in the AFD grant pipeline for 2003. A joint \nAFD-ADB  Fact-Finding  Mission  visited  Lao  PDR  from  22  May  to  3  June  2002.2  The  Mission \nparticipated in the tripartite meeting to discuss the project design as presented in the draft final \nreport submitted on 30 April 2002. The Mission and Government agreed on the overall design of \nthe Project but the consultant was instructed to present its components in a coherent framework \nand also work out more detailed implementation arrangements. This project proposal is, in part, \nbased on the final report submitted in September 2002. \n \n3. \nBased on the guidance received from the management review meeting, held on 18 July \n2002,  the  Loan  Appraisal  Mission  was  fielded  from  25  July  to  8  August  2002  to  finalize  the \ndesign  and  implementation  arrangements  of  the  Project.3  The  staff  review  committee  meeting \nheld on 3 September 2002 (i) confirmed that all relevant interdepartmental comments received \nhad  been  incorporated  into  the  project  documents,  (ii)  endorsed  the  project  design,  and  (iii) \ndetermined there was no need for second management review meeting.  \n \n4. \nThe  Appraisal  Mission  had  determined  that  the  consultant  did  not  prepare  the  detailed \ncomponent costs and financing plan in close consultation with the three line agencies involved \nin the Project. A follow-up appraisal mission was fielded from 5\u201312 September 2002 to finalize \nthe component costs and financing plan.4 \n \n\n                                                 \n1    ADB. 2000.

In the recent years, the Ministry of Agriculture \nand Forestry (MAF) has adopted an integrated approach to natural resource management in the \nNam  Ngum  River  Basin  (NNRB).  This  Project  is  part  of  the  ministry\u2019s  natural  resource \nmanagement  and  rural  development  plan.  The  Ministry  of  Industry  and  Handicraft  has  also \nidentified prospective hydropower schemes in this river basin for likely investments.  \n \n2. \nNNRB  is  in  the  north-central  part  of  the  country  and  covers  16,906  square  kilometers \n(km2), including the 8,297 km2 Nam Ngum watershed (Map). NNRB extends northeast from the \nVientiane  waterfront  about  400  km  to  Xieng  Khouang  Province  and  makes  up  2.73%  of  the \nentire lower Mekong basin. NNRB may be divided into three distinct areas, each with its unique \nconditions and characteristics: source, storage, and sink: \n \n\n(i)  Source. The upper basin or Nam Ngum watershed is above the NN-1 reservoir, with \nthe  western  boundary  running  along  the  Nam  Song  River  to  the  north  toward \nPhoukhoun town. The upper basin is the main catchment for the NN-1 reservoir. The \nland  is  mainly  steep  and  sloping,  except  on  the  Plain  of  Jars.  The  upper  basin \nconsists  of  parts  of  Xieng  Khouang  and  Vientiane  provinces  and  Xaisomboun \nSpecial Zone. During the Indochina conflict (1965\u20131975), the upper basin, along with \nsome other parts of the country, endured the heaviest bombardment in the history of \nmodern warfare. It resulted in considerable displacement and loss of human life and \nsignificantly  damage  the  watershed.  However,  natural  regeneration  has  helped  the \nwatershed  recover.  Unexploded  ordinance  is  still  a  major  hazard  around  the  poor \nvillages, killing or maiming scores of people every year. \n\n \n(ii)  Storage. Commissioned in 1971, the NN-1 reservoir is the largest artificial lake in the \nregion spread over an area of about 450 km2, storing 7,010 million cubic meters (m3) \nof  water  at  full  supply  level  at  212  meters  mean  sea  level.  At  minimum  operating \nlevel  of  196  meters  mean  sea  level,  it  holds  2,501  million  m3  of  water.  The  lake\u2019s \nannual  inflow  from  the  Nam  Ngum  River  exceeds  300  cubic  meters  per  second \n(m3/sec). An additional mean flow of 59 m3/sec is supplied by an interriver diversion \nfrom  the  Nam  Song  River  at  the  northern  tip  of  NN-1  reservoir,  and  another  mean \nflow  of  39  m3/sec  by  an  interwatershed  transfer  from  the  Nam  Leuk  River  at  the \neastern tip of NN-1 reservoir. Surface water quality in general is good. An estimated \n40  species  of  fish  are  found  in  the  reservoir  but  only  12  are  caught  for  trade.  By  a \nconservative  estimate,  the  total  annual  value  of  reservoir  fishing  yield  is  over  $1 \nmillion.  Minimum  annual  fishing  yield  is  estimated  to  be  32.6  kilograms  (kg)  per \nhectare (ha) at full supply level.  \n\n \n\n\f28 \n\nAppendix 6 \n\n(iii) Sink. The lower basin consists of the flat land of the Vientiane Plain below the Nam \nLik\u2013Nam  Ngum  river  junction  and  down  to  the  confluence  of  the  Nam  Ngum  River \nwith Mekong River near Pak-Ngum town. During the wet season, Nam Ngum River\u2019s \nflow into the Mekong River exceeds 700 m3/sec. The lower basin consists of parts of \nVientiane Province and Vientiane Municipality.   \n\n \n3. \nThe  lower  basin  is  a  continuation  of  the  Isarn  Plateau  (northern  Thailand).  The  lower \nbasin  is  bisected  by  the  Mekong  River,  which  cuts  off  the  Vientiane  Plain  from  the  rest  of  the \nplateau.  However,  the  original  ecology  is  the  same\u2014mostly  flat  land,  with  mixed  lateritic  and \nshale-based soils, with generally saline groundwater. Although its soils are not naturally high in \nnutrients, the area is a much more productive than the upper basin. \n \nRainfall ranges from 1,400 millimeters (mm) in the upper basin to 2,800 mm near Vang \n4. \nVieng town, in the Nam Lik subwatershed in the lower basin. For 7 months, May-November, the \nupper  basin  has  abundant  water.  However,  during  the  other  5  months,  December-April, \ndegraded  upstream  subwatersheds  dry  out  and  smaller  streams  cease  to  flow.  Dry-season \nflows  in  the  mainstream  above  NN-1  may  have  been  reduced  because  of  deforestation,  ever \nincreasing  pressure  from  shifting  cultivation  and  unsustainable  harvesting  of  nontimber  forest \nproducts  (NTFPs),  and  free  grazing  of  the  sizeable  livestock  population.  These  factors \ncombined may have caused some deforestation and loss of soil structure resulting in reduced \ninfiltration and recharging. \n \n5. \nMost of the 575,000 rural population in the basin have a high ethnic diversity. Another 1 \nmillion people live in Vientiane City and its plains. Population density in the upper basin ranges \nfrom 30/km2 in Xieng Khouang (61%) to around 9/km2 in Xaisomboun Special Region (29%). A \ntotal  of  239  villages  have  been  recorded.  While  the  population  of  the  watershed  is  said  to  be \nhighly mobile, some well-established villages exist. At 2.3% per annum, the population growth \nrate is high and a population increase of 80% is expected by 2020.  \n \n6. \nWidespread  poverty  is  a  major  development  challenge,  particularly  in  the  upper  basin. \nAbout  65%  of  its  total  population  or  200,000  people  live  below  the  poverty  line  of  $11.20  per \ncapita  per  month.  Although  rice  shortages  are  reported  for  3-4  months  a  year  by  many \nhouseholds,  poverty  in  NNRB  is  not  synonymous  with  hunger\u2014NTFPs  meet  food  shortfall.  In \nthe  past,  abundant  natural  resources  provided  sustenance  for  poor  villagers,  but  these \nresources are now dwindling because of overexploitation as people search for food or sell forest \nproducts and NTFPs to pay for health services, education, and consumption.  \n \n7. \nOutside  Vientiane  Municipality,  over  90%  households  depend  on  agriculture.  In  NNRB \nrice  productivity  is  low  and  farmers  use  limited  inputs.  Irrigation  schemes  are  often  poorly \ndesigned and executed, resulting in high water demand and low productivity. The upper basin \ncommunities live on subsistence farming and are locked in an acute poverty trap, created in part \nby  (i)  lack  of  regional  market  access,  (ii)  absence  of  appropriate  technology  and  training,  and \n(iii)  lack  of  capital  to  fuel  the  transformation.  In  contrast,  farmers  are  entering  a  period  of \nagricultural  transformation  where  market  forces  are  starting  to  deliver  agricultural  inputs \ncommercially.  In  the  wet  season,  nearly  all  flatlands  are  planted  to  rice.  More  land  is  coming \nunder irrigation in the dry season, producing a second crop of rice but also other crops such as \nmaize, vegetables, tobacco, and fruits. While cereal production elsewhere has increased rather \nslowly, the Vientiane Plain has seen higher production increases in recent years and the overall \ngrowth rate of agriculture has increased to around 5% a year from 2\u20133%. \n \n\n\fAppendix 6 \n\n29 \n\nCattle,  buffalo,  pigs,  and  poultry  are  raised  on  farms.  In  the  upland  areas,  the  local \n8. \nyellow \u201cAsian\u201d breed of cattle is most common. Livestock is the single most important source of \nfamily  income,  which  could  be  substantially  improved  with  better  forage  and  health-care \ninterventions. Livestock management is severely constrained by disease, a generally low level \nof animal husbandry skills, and low-nutrient pasture. Fish is an important source of protein for \nmost  rural  households.  Little  is  known  about  the  ecology  and  recruitment  of  the  more  than  60 \nreported  fish  species,  but  important  fisheries  exist  for  the  migrating  cyprinids  moving  between \nthe reservoir and upper basin.  \n \n9. \nThe forest sector contributes about 7\u201310% to overall gross domestic product (GDP) and \n15\u201320%  to  nonagricultural  GDP  of  the  country.  In  1997,  forest  area  was  estimated  at  about \n5,000 km2 or about 30% of NNRB and 2% of national forest cover. However, forest diversity has \nbeen notably reduced with a loss of mixed dense forest caused by selective logging. Wood and \nshrubland  account  for  40%  of  NNRB.  The  upper  basin  forest  is  highly  fragmented  while  the  \n(Vientiane Plain) has little remaining forest cover. In the upper basin, forestry is one of the few \neconomic activities, and NTFPs provide more than 50% of household incomes. The extensively \nforested upper basin (especially Xaisomboun Special Region) has a comparative advantage in \nthese  products  as  the  forests  of  neighboring  Thailand,  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China,  and  Viet \nNam  have  long  since  virtually  disappeared.  NTFP  and  niche  products  include  cardamom, \nbenzoin, paper mulberry, medicinal plants, wild herbs, wild orchids, bamboo shoots, and ferns. \nApart  from  substantially  contributing  to  local  food  security  and  livelihood  needs,  and  providing \nhabitat  for  a  large  variety  of  animal  and  plant  species,  these  forests  are  indispensable  in \nregulating hydrological flow of the basin and protecting downstream and lowland areas. \n \nNNRB  is  inaccessible  because  of  underdeveloped  infrastructure.  Secondary  roads  are \n10. \npoor  and  often  open  only  in  the  dry  season.  No  reliable,  all-weather  direct  lines  of \ncommunication  link  major  cities.  Various  regional  road  links  to  Viet  Nam  and  the  People\u2019s \nRepublic  of  China  are  being  constructed  or  improved,  but  much  of  the  upper  basin  remains \ninaccessible by road, especially in the wet season. \n \n11. \nThe  Indochina  conflict  (1965\u201375),  increasing  population  pressure,  shifting  cultivation, \nand insufficient institutional capacity have exerted substantial pressure on the water resources \nof  the  upper  basin.  Unsustainable  timber  and  NTFP  harvesting  for  subsistence  as  well  as \ncommercial purposes have resulted in the decline and degradation of forest resources. Forest \ncover  loss  and  depleted  growing  stock  have  reduced  the  extent  and  growth  potential  of  these \nforests, undermining their watershed and biodiversity conservation potential and effectiveness. \nInadequate  forest  resource  planning  and  management  capacities,  and  outdated  resource \ndevelopment  technologies  and  practices  of  the  concerned  line  agencies  and  communities \nhinder  forests  and  forestry  from  meeting  local  and  national  economic  development  needs  and \npriorities, especially by ensuring food security and creating jobs. \n \nB.  \n \n12. \n \n\nThe development strategy for NNRB is based, inter alia, on the following assumptions: \n\nDevelopment Strategy for the Nam Ngum River Basin \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nAgricultural  development  in  the  upper  basin  should  consider  mainly  poverty \nreduction and sustainable environmental management.  \nPlanning and implementation of development interventions, unlike a conventional \napproach,  should  be  based  on  hydraulic  boundaries  rather  than  administrative \nones\u2014provincial  and  district\u2014and  subprojects  should  thus  encompass  sub-  or \nmicrowatersheds. \n\n\f30 \n\nAppendix 6 \n\nImprovement in crop productivity (especially of rice) will reduce poverty and help \nreduce  the  incidence  of  shifting  cultivation,  thereby  improving  soil  structure  in \ndegraded watersheds. \nBetter  livestock  management  and  disease  control  will  reduce  poverty  and  the \nincidence of free grazing in critical watersheds. \nForest  and  biodiversity  conservation  are  important  (probably  on  a  global  scale, \nand certainly as far as the Mekong riparian countries are concerned), especially \nin the upper basin areas. Forest restoration and sustainable NTFP management, \nusing  appropriate  community-based  management  practices,  will  reduce  poverty \nand improve watersheds. \nThe NN-1 reservoir provides livelihood to over 20,000 people and is an important \nsource  of  protein.  Restoration  and  sustainable  management  of  the  upper  basin \nwill maintain the quality of water and improve the water retention capacity of the \nsubwatersheds, thereby prolonging the period of inflow into the reservoir. \nBy maintaining the flow of good quality of water into the reservoir, the quality of \nfisheries,  and  drinking  and  irrigation  water  can  be  ensured.  By  prolonging  the \nperiod of water inflow through forest restoration and soil structure improvement, \nhydropower  generation  capacity  of  the  NN-1  reservoir  can  be  better  regulated \nand increased and some floods mitigated. \n\n(viii)  To  achieve  these  goals,  effective  coordination  among  all  relevant  water  sector \nline  agencies  and  provincial  departments  is  imperative.  The  capacity  of  these \ninstitutions  and  communities  must  be  strengthened  and  a  closer  working \nrelationship  established  among  them  to  enable  them  to  share  data  and \ninformation and synergize their activities. \n\nSubproject Selection Criteria \n\n \nC. \n \n13. \nwere determined as follows: \n \n\nBased  on  NNRB\u2019s  development  strategy,  the  main  elements  of  subproject  selection \n\nAll  subproject  areas  will  comprise  a  micro-  or  subwatershed,  implying  that  the \nbasic  planning  unit  will  encompass  a  hydraulic  boundary.  Micro-  and \nsubwatersheds  will  be  prioritized  by  studying  the  land-use  patterns  in  detail  by \nemploying geographical information system techniques. \nSocial and economic characteristics of the population will be studied in detail by \nemploying  participatory  rural  assessment  techniques.  Those  micro-  and/or \nsubwatersheds where 25% or more of the population is living below the poverty \nline  will  be  preferred.  Ethnic  groups  and  women  did  not  equally  benefit  from \nprevious development projects. This Project will create a conducive environment \nand  allocate  appropriate  resources  to  improve  their  access  to  development \nopportunities.  Micro-  and/or  subwatersheds  will  be  preferred  where  minorities \nand women are ensured equal participation in project activities. \nAn \nthe  proposed  micro-  and/or \nsubwatershed  will  be  carried  out  following  government  and  ADB  guidelines. \nThose  micro-  and/or  subwatersheds  where  the  level  of  degradation  and  loss  of \nbiodiversity is higher will be preferred.  \nAlthough  the  economic  viability  of  a  micro-  and/or  subwatershed  is  difficult  to \ndetermine, only those will be selected that demonstrate significant development \npotential,  i.e.,  that  have  large  degraded  areas  and  a  critical  mass  of  people  to \nsupport project activities.  \n\ninitial  environmental  assessment  of \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 6 \n\n31 \n\nSelected Core Subprojects \n\nD. \n \nBy employing the above subproject selection criteria during the feasibility study, five core \n14. \nsubproject  areas  have  been  selected \ninitiate  project  activities  (Table  A6).  These \nsubwatersheds  have  90  villages  or  5,811  households  with  an  estimated  total  population  of \n38,658. Total cultivated area is 4,520 ha (or 2% of the total cultivated area of NNRB), of which \n3,000  ha  (66%)  is  lowland  rain-fed  rice.  Supplementary  wet-season  irrigation  supports  only \nabout 250 ha of rice land. The rest (about 1,270 ha) is an upland mix of cash crops, vegetables, \nand  fruit  trees.  Shifting  cultivation  is  practiced  on  another  31,200  ha.  Following  the  same \nselection  criteria,  additional  subproject  areas  will  be  selected  to  replicate  investment  activities \nduring project implementation. \n \n\nto \n\nTable A6: Salient Features of the Selected Subprojects \n\nShifting Cultivation Area (ha) \n\n21,400 \n\n3,800 \n\n2,400 \n\nNam Toum-\nKha-Piang \n \nXieng Khouang  Vientiane \n\nNam  \nXan \n\nNam  \nMuay \n\nNam \nPha-Yen \n\nNam  \nChia-Hao \n\nXaisomboun/ \nVientiane  \nPhoun \n\nXaisomboun/ \nVientiane \nXaisomboun \n\nXaisomboun/ \nXieng Khouang \nXaisomboun \n\nPek \n\n \n254 \n\n72% \n\n1,300 \n\n4,800 \n\n21 \n\n1,040 \n\nLong Xan \n\n \n783 \n\n96% \n\n2,350 \n\n28 \n\n \n482 \n\n98% \n\n480 \n\n21 \n\n2,094 \n\n1,063 \n\n \n464 \n\n68% \n\n465 \n\n9 \n\n420 \n\n \n501 \n\n69% \n\n500 \n\n1,000 \n\n11 \n\n1,194 \n\n8,036 \n\n16 \n\nLow \n\nNo \n\nPopulation (no.) \nPopulation Density (persons/km2)  28 \n\n7,317 \n\n14,690 \n\n6,099 \n\n2,516 \n\n19 \n\n13 \n\n5 \n\nElevation above MSL (m) \n\n> 1000 \n\n200-700 \n\n200-700 \n\n600-1000 \n\n> 1000 \n\nLow \n\nNo \n\nHigh \n\nYes \n\nHigh \n\nNo \n\nHigh \n\nNo \n\nDistance from Vientiane City (km)  220 \n\n90 \n\n130 \n\n170 \n\n130 \n\n \n\nSubprojects/ \nSubwatersheds \n\nProvince \n\nDistrict \n\n \nTotal Land Area (km2) \n\nForest Cover Area \n\nAgricultural Area (ha) \n\nVillages (no.) \n\nHouseholds (no.) \n\nBiodiversity Potential \n\nNational Biodiversity \nConservation Area \n\n \nMSL = Mean Sea Level \n \n\n\f32 \n\nAppendix  7 \n\n \n\nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nYes \n\n \nYes \n\nPoverty Analysis  \n\n          Proposed Classification \n\n \nSector identified as a National Priority in \nCountry Poverty Partnership Agreement?   \n\n \nA.         Linkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \n \nSector identified as a National Priority \nin Country Poverty Analysis?   \n \n \nContribution of the sector/subsector to reduce poverty in the Lao People's Democratic Republic: \nThe Government has set the consumption poverty line at 2,100 kilocalories per capita per day, which is \nroughly equivalent to $11.20 per capita per month. Approximately 39% of the country\u2019s 5 million people \nlive  below  the  poverty  line.  However,  in  rural  areas  poverty  is  pervasive  and  as  much  as  65%  of  the \nrural  population  in  many  areas  of  the  county  is  considered  poor.  The  poor  in  the  Nam  Ngum  River \nBasin  (NNRB)  are  concentrated  in  the  upper  basin;  ethnic  groups,  including  the  Khmou,  Yao,  and \nHmong; and former lowland Lao. The intensity of poverty measured in terms of food security is much \nhigher among the ethnic groups. The Project is expected to significantly reduce poverty by improving \nhousehold food security through: (i) increased crop and livestock productivity; (ii) better access to land \nand forest resources; and (iii) training, and extension. \n \n \nB. \n \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?  \nParticipatory poverty analysis using both quantitative and \nqualitative indicators is necessary. Most men and women  \ndefine poverty as food insecurity. \n \n \nC. \n \nStakeholder Analysis. During project preparation, stakeholder analysis included government officials \nat all levels; mass organizations, i.e., LAO Front for National Construction (LFNC), Lao Women\u2019s Union \n(LWU);  local  communities,  particularly  ethnic  groups;  poor  women,  and  NGOs.  Participatory  rural \nassessments (PRAs) were carried out separately with poor men and women. The Project will promote \na fully participatory approach by encouraging the organization of resource-user and women\u2019s groups at \nthe  village  level  by  mass  organizations  and  NGOs.  Training  in  participatory  approaches,  gender \nsensitivity,  and  ethnic  issues  will  be  provided  to  the  implementing  agencies.  Participatory  training  will \nbe  imparted  in  crop  productivity  improvement;  livestock  management;  and  forest  restoration. \nSustainable  harvesting  of  nontimber  forest  products  will  be  promoted  using  peoples\u2019  expertise \nwherever applicable; especially, women will be organized for participation and training. Poverty impact \nassessments will be conducted through PRAs. \n \nParticipation  Strategy.  The  project  participation  strategy  focuses  on  community-based  mobilization \nand  organization  of  the  poor,  disadvantaged,  and  particularly  women  and  ethnic  groups.  The  target \nbeneficiaries  will  select  and  implement  community  activities  and  monitor  project  performance.  Mass \norganizations  and  NGOs  will  be  fully  involved  in  implementing  the  participation  strategy  under  the \nProject.  \n \n \n \n                                                                                                    \n \n\n \nPoverty reduction \n\nParticipation Process \n\n\f \nD. \n  \n\nPotential Issues1  \n\n \nSignificant/ \nNonsignificant/ \nUncertain/ \nNone \n\nSignificant \n\nResettlement3   None \n\n \n\nGender  \n \n \n\nAffordability  \n\nNone \n\nNone \n\nLabor \n \n \n\nYes \n\nIndigenous \nPeople \n \n \n\nAppendix  7 \n\n33  \n\n \nPlan \nRequired2 \n\nNone \n\nYes \n\nNo \n\nNo \n\nYes \n \nAn ethnic \ngroups\u2019 \ndevelopment \nplan has been \nprepared under \nthe Project. \n\n \n \nStrategy to Address Issues \n \n\nlabor-saving \n\nPoor  women  will  be  mobilized  and  organized \ninto groups for empowerment through gender-\nsensitive  training  and  extension,  increased \nfarm  productivity, \nlivestock  \nsustainable forest management.

These \nactivities  will  help  reduce  food  insecurity, \nimprove  women\u2019s  incomes,  and  strengthen \ntheir  status  in  the  community  and  establish \ncontact with the government agencies.   \n \n\nCommunities  in  the  upper  basin,  face  food \ninsecurity  and  lack  sustainable  livelihoods. \nDuring  PRAs,  the  respondents,  especially \nwomen,  indicated  that  they  were  eager  to \nparticipate in the project activities.  \n \nEthnic  groups  are  among  the  poorest  and \nmost  vulnerable  communities  in  the  country. \nThey  suffer  from  social  exclusion  due  to  a \nvariety  of  factors.  The  Project  is  designed  to \nensure  their  full  participation  in  all  relevant  \nactivities.  They  will  be  mobilized  and \norganized  for  culturally  appropriate  extension \ndevelopment \ntraining, \nprograms.

Two \nimmediate  objectives  of  the  Project  are  to  (i)  foster  and  institutionalize  Integrated  Water \nResources Management (IWRM) in the mainstream management process of the Government at \nthe  central,  provincial,  and  district  levels;  and  (ii)  support  investment  interventions  in  relatively \ndegraded  parts  of  Nam  Ngum  River  Basin  (NNRB)  to  ensure  sustainable  watershed \nmanagement and to provide livelihood opportunities for the poor and ethnic groups. The Project \nhas three main components: (i) IWRM, (ii) reservoir management and river basin modeling, and \n(iii) watershed management. \n \n2. \nDuring the feasibility study, 5 core subprojects were selected following an agreed upon \nselection  criteria  (Appendix  6).  These  subprojects  encompass  subwatershed  boundaries.  An \ninitial  environmental  examination  (IEE)  for  one  of  the  subprojects,  Nam  Toum-Kha-Piang,  has \nbeen  carried  out  as  a  sample  for  IEE  of  other  subprojects.  The  IEE  covers  a  wide  scope  of \npotential environmental impacts associated with these interventions. The IEE follows guidelines \nprovided by Environmental Assessment Requirements of the Asian Development Bank (ADB), \nEnvironmental  Guidelines  for  Selected  Agriculture  and  Natural  Resources  Development \nProjects,  and  Handbook  for  Incorporation  of  Integrated  Pest  Management  in  Agriculture \nProjects.  Host-country  guidelines  taken  into  account  include  the  Environmental  Impact \nAssessment  Regulation  of  the  Science,  Technology,  and  Environment  Agency  (STEA)  of  the \nLao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR).  \n \nB. \n \nThe  objective  of  the  Project  is  to  provide  productive  livelihood  opportunities  to  poor \n3. \nethnic  groups,  thereby,  ensuring  long-term  sustainability  of  the  subwatershed.  The  proposed \nactivities  will  include  (i)  capacity  building,  (ii)  crop  productivity  improvement,  (iii)  livestock \nmanagement,  and  (iv)  forest  restoration.  The  Project  is  not  expected  to  have  any  adverse \nimpact on the environment, therefore, it was assigned Category B. In fact, project activities are \nexpected to have a significant positive impact on poverty and the environment.  \n \n4. \nCapacity  Building.  This  activity  will  strengthen  the  capacity  of  counterpart  staff  in  the \nprovincial and district departments as well as train the potential beneficiaries. No direct adverse \nenvironmental impacts are expected from this component. \n  \n5. \nCrop  Productivity  Improvement.  Crop  productivity  is  low  due  to  farmers\u2019  lack  of \naccess  to  modern  technological  package  and  their  inefficient  farm  practices.  This  activity  will \ntarget degraded parts of the subproject and those with special environmental concerns for the \nwater  sector.  Outputs  will  include  (i)  more  productive  and  stable  farming  systems,  and  (ii) \nimproved food security. As a result shifting cultivation will reduce considerably.  \n \n6. \nLivestock  Management.  This  activity  will  improve  livestock  management  practices  by \n(i)  utilizing  improved  forage  technologies,  (ii)  modifying  grazing  practices  to  emphasize \nmanaged  rather  than  free-range  grazing  of  cattle,  (iii)  identifying  major  livestock  diseases  and \ntheir  appropriate  treatment,  and  (iv)  developing  a  farmer-centered  extension  system  at  the \nvillage level. Interventions in the fishery subsector will extend fish technology to the village level. \n \n\nDescription of the Project \n\n\f Appendix  8 \n\n        35   \n\nDescription of the Environment \n\nForest  Restoration.  The  Project  will  use  framework  species  technology  for  restoring \n7. \ndegraded  natural  forest  area  with  crown  cover  ranging  between  20-40%.  Using  agroforestry \ntechnologies,  the  Project  will  improve  forest  condition  and  production  of  timber  and  nontimber \nforest  products  (NTFP)  over  state  and  commune  forest  lands.  Individual  and/or  groups  of \nhouseholds will be involved in this activity.  \n \nC. \n \nNNRB,  in  north-central  Lao  PDR,  covers  an  area  of  approximately  16,906  square \n8. \nkilometres (km2). The upper basin, that covers about 8,297 km2, is the catchment area for Nam \nNgum  1  reservoir.  NNRB  extends  northeast  from  the  Vientiane  waterfront  about  400  km  to \nXieng  Khouang  and  is  equivalent  to  about  2.73%  of  the  entire  lower  Mekong  basin.  The \ncatchment outlet is 157 meters (m) above sea level, and the highest point is 2,682 m above sea \nlevel. Less than one third lies below 300 m above sea level.  \n \n9. \nThe  Nam  Toum-Kha-Piang  subproject  is  in  Xieng  Khouang  Province,  which  is  in  the \nuppermost part of the basin (Basin MAP). It has a catchment area of 254 km2 with a population \nof  7,317  (1,040  households)  spread  in  21  villages.  Most  (91%)  households  make  living  in \nagriculture. With average annual rainfall of 1,300\u20132,000 millimeters, the annual water usage is \nabout 2.12% of the Nam Ngum annual discharge. Land ranges from large and small flat valley \nfloors  to  rolling  uplands  1,100\u20131,500  m  or  more  above  sea  level.  Most  flat  valley  floors  have \nbeen  developed  into  paddy  fields  with  traditional  and  modern  irrigation.  About  81%  of  the \nsubproject area has a forest cover and shifting cultivation is practiced on about 1,300 ha (Land \nUse MAP).  \n \n10. \nStudies  in  1991\u20131995  confirmed  low  nutrient  status  and  phosphate  deficiency  in  most \nareas of the basin. The upper basin has low fertility, and highly acid soils are common in Xieng \nKhouang. Whether soil acidity affects the aquatic environment is not known. The other areas in \nthe upper basin are karstic with basic soils. Continuing loss of forest cover and soil degradation \nis  threatening  productivity  and  increasing  stream  flow  variability,  since  water  storage  in  the \nforest litter, soil, and subsoil zones are reduced.  \n \nTotal forest area for NNRB was estimated at 5,000 km2 or 28% cover in 1997. However, \n11. \nforest  types  have  changed  significantly,  notably  with  a  loss  of  mixed  dense  forest  caused  by \nselective  logging.  Wood  and  scrubland  account  for  40%  of  the  basin.  The  forest  in  the  upper \nbasin is highly fragmented while the lower basin has little remaining forest cover. Collection of \nNTFP is a major secondary activity for many farm households in NNRB, especially in the upper \nbasin.  It  has  a  comparative  advantage  in  these  products  because  its  forest  cover  is  more \nextensive than that of Thailand, People's Republic of China, and Viet Nam, whose forests have \nlong since virtually disappeared. NTFP and niche products include cardamom, benzoin, paper \nmulberry, medicinal plants, wild herbs, wild orchids, and ferns.  \n \n12.  Widespread poverty is the major development challenge, particularly in the upper basin. \nOver  65%  of  the  population  lives  below  the  poverty  line  of  $11.2  per  person  per  month.  The \npoverty  gap  index  for  Xieng  Khouang  is  2.9.  Abundant  natural  resources  in  the  basin  once \nprovided  sustenance  for  local  communities,  but  these  resources  are  dwindling  due  to \noverexploitation as more and more poor people search for food or sell forest and NTFPs to pay \nfor health, education, and consumption costs.  \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f36 \n\nAppendix 8 \n\nScreening of Potential Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n\nD. \n \n13. \nThe  proposed  subproject  activities  will  lead  to  more  efficient  management  of  the \nwatershed, which will improve water conservation, provide sustainable livelihoods, and restore \nforests. As a result, human pressure on the environment will decrease:  \n \n\n(i)  \n\n(ii)  \n\n(iii)  \n\nImproved  crop  yields  either  from  irrigated  or  nonirrigated  agriculture,  combined \nwith crop diversification (e.g., to fruit trees), will reduce swidden agriculture;  \nReduced  grazing  pressure  on  forests  will  allow  greater  regeneration  of  woody \nspecies, increasing diversity and abundance; and \nSelection and propagation of local NTFPs will increase the intraspecific diversity \nof selected species. \n\n \n14. \nIn  general,  most  negative  environmental  project  impacts  will  result  from  three  physical \ninvestment  activities,  but  most  will  be  minor  and  confined  to  (i)  inappropriate  selection  of \nlocation  for  interventions;  (ii)  inappropriate  selection  of  tree  species  or  varieties;  (iii) \nindiscriminate  use  of  agrochemicals;  and  (iv)  health  and  safety  issues  of  small-scale \nconstruction (e.g., weirs). Potential impacts for each physical investment activity are as follows: \n \n15. \nCrop  Productivity.  This  intervention  will  improve  crop  productivity  but  with  little  or  no \nuse  of  fertilizers  and  pesticides.  The  Lao-International  Rice  Research  Institute\u2019s  high  yielding \nvarieties,  suited  for  upper  basin,  do  not  require  use  of  chemical  inputs.  Besides,  this \ntechnological package encourages integrated pest and nutrient management.  \n \nFertilizer  use  in  Lao  PDR  has  always  been  low  but  it  is  increasing.  During  the  field \n16. \ninvestigations,  a  range  of  fertilizer  application  rates  were  reported.  In  Vientiane  Province, \nfarmers use nitrogen-phosphorous-potassium (NPK) fertilizer at about 100 kg/ha for wet season \nrice, and 250 kg/ha for dry-season rice. Fertilizer usage in the upper basin is negligible because \nof weak input markets, and generally farmers cannot afford cash inputs. \n \n17. \nLivestock  Improvement.  Livestock  can  have  a  wide  variety  of  positive  or  negative \neffects on rangeland ecosystems, and grazing impacts can be seen at the species, community, \nand landscape levels. Grazing has impacts on individual plants or species, plant communities, \nsoils and watersheds, and wildlife. Overgrazing frequently changes the composition of the plant \nand  animal  population.  Some  effects  are  the  direct  result  of  heavy  grazing  and  occur  rapidly, \nothers  are  more  indirect  and  may  take  decades  to  occur.  Accordingly,  the  proposed  project \ninterventions need to incorporate a program to monitor effects of livestock on various ecosystem \ntypes  in  the  subproject  area  to  minimize  detrimental  impacts  while  supporting  good \nmanagement practice. \n \nForest  Restoration.  Restoring  previously  forested  areas  has  only  positive  impacts. \n18. \nCertain  concerns,  however,  include  the  selection  of  species  to  be  introduced  (e.g.,  fruit  trees, \neucalyptus,  teak)  and  how  the  activity  will  affect  the  overall  farming  system.  The  Government \npolicy  is  to  avoid  growing  eucalyptus  in  upper  basin  as  it  damages  soil  structure.  Teak  is  a \npossible  commercial  species,  but  its  plantations  have  to  be  accessible  to  transport  and  other \ninfrastructure.  Orchards  are  good  in  principle,  but  their  impact  on  the  general  environment \nrequires a review and preparation of possible mitigation measures as the project progresses. \n \n \n \n \n\n\f Appendix  8 \n\n        37   \n\nInstitutional Requirement and Environmental Monitoring Program \n\nE.  \n \n19. \nThe  Environmental  Protection  Law  (Decree  068/PM)  was  passed  in  1999.  The \nregulations for environmental impact assessment were completed last year with assistance from \nADB.  STEA  is  responsible  for  overall  coordination  of  environmental  issues  and  management \nand it reports to the Office of the Prime Minister. Recently, STEA established branch offices in \nsix  provinces  in  northern  and  southern  Lao  PDR  to  develop  environmental  management \ncapacity at the provincial level. However, due to insufficient capacity of STEA branches and the \nprovincial  departments  of  the  Ministry  of  Agriculture  and  Forestry,  the  project  should  provide \nthem  with  training  to  ensure  that  proposed  mitigation  measures  of  the  IEE  would  be  well \nunderstood and implemented.  \n \nSince the scope for each project activity has not been finalized, environmental officials \n20. \nand  provincial  counterpart  staff  should  annually  visit  all  village  interventions  in  the  subproject. \nThe visits will cover construction and management phases of the project and involve a checklist \nof (i) locations (Are they impacting on any form of designated protection forest or conservation \narea?); (ii) species (Have any alien species or varieties been used?); (iii) agrochemicals (Have \nany  been  used  injudiciously,  damaging  peoples\u2019  health  or  nontarget  species?);  and  (iv)  health \nand safety. The concerned Project Implementation Unit (PIU) must prepare monthly reports on \nland use and health and safety and submit the same to Office of the National Project Manager.  \n \n21. \nTo ensure that all applicable national and provincial environmental laws, regulations, and \nstandards,  as  well  as  ADB\u2019s  environmental  requirements,  will  be  met  during  project \nimplementation and operation, an environmental monitoring plan (EMP) will be prepared during \nthe  start-up  phase  of  the  Project.  At  least,  one  domestic  environment  consultant  for  about  2 \nperson-months, and an environment counterpart staff need to be recruited for the PIU to ensure \nthat EMP is well prepared, and that proposed mitigation measures identified in the IEE will be \nincorporated in project design, construction, and operation. The cost of implementing proposed \nmitigation measures and of recruiting the consultant will be borne by the Project.  \n \nF. \n \nThis subproject involves capacity building of Government staff and local communities for \n22. \nwatershed management as well as crop productivity improvement, livestock management, and \nforest  restoration.  In  general,  the  proposed  activities  will  increase  household  incomes,  ensure \nsustainable  livelihoods,  and  improve  water  resources  of  the  subwatershed  (subproject). \nPotential negative environmental impacts of this subproject may include those resulting from (i) \ninappropriate  use  of  agrochemicals  impacting  on  water  quality  and  human  health,  (ii) \novergrazing  or  inappropriate  pasture  management,  and  (iii)  inappropriate  selection  of  tree \nspecies or varieties. Negative impacts, however, will be limited in duration and extent, and can \nbe  mitigated  using  guidelines,  technological  controls,  and  regulatory  mechanisms  already  in \nplace.  Therefore,  a  detailed  environmental  impact  assessment  for  this  subproject  is  not \nwarranted. \n\nConclusions and Recommendations \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\nCOST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING PLAN \n \n\nTable A9.1 Cost Summary by Components \n($\u2019000) \n\n \n \n \n \n1.

The \nconsulting services will be recruited in two packages. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) will \nfinance one package of 137 person-months of international and 201 person-months of domestic \nconsultants.  Agence  Francaise  de  Developpement  (AFD)  will  finance,  in  parallel,  another \npackage of 102 person-months of international and 212 person-months of domestic consulting \nservices. A detailed breakdown of both consulting packages is in Table A11. To ensure effective \ncoordination among all three project components, the position of the team leader and those of \nother  key  consultants  will  be  financed  through  the  ADB  package.  All  consultants  would  be \nrequired  to  work  under  the  guidance  of  the  team  leader  following  specific  terms  of  reference \n(TOR) based on a consolidated work plan. Outline TOR for each of the three components, their \nassociated  activities,  and  project  management  are  provided  below.  Specific  and  detailed  TOR \nare provided in the supplementary appendixes. \n \nA. \n \n2. \nThe  consultants,  consisting  of  an  integrated  water  resources  management  (IWRM) \nspecialist  and  a  number  of  other  short-term  specialists,  will  help  the  Water  Resources \nCoordination  Committee  (WRCC)  plan,  develop,  and  manage  water  resources  in  Nam  Ngum \nRiver Basin (NNRB) and at the national level, as applicable. The consultants will help coordinate \nthe work of other water sector agencies, as well. The WRCC Mandate (1999) requires WRCC to \n\u201cencourage, support, and promote the exchange of data and information relevant to water and \nwater resources.\u201d The Draft Policy on Water and Water Resources (2000) recommends actions \nfor data management. To meet these objectives, the consultants will help (i) develop a detailed \ndata  and  information  management  strategy;  (ii)  prepare  regulations,  data-sharing  agreements, \netc.;  (iii)  review,  update,  and  disseminate  the  metadata  directory  established  earlier;  (iv) \nfacilitate  data  sharing  between  national  agencies  and  provinces,  and  between  project \ncomponents;  (v)  prepare  proposals  for  review  and  upgrade  data  collection  networks  and  data \nmanagement systems (at the national, provincial, and river-basin levels); and (vi) prepare and \nmaintain a water resource information system for WRCC.  \n \n3. \nDuring the Project, a coordinated and capable planning process and partnership should \nbe  built  between  the  WRCC  Secretariat  (WRCCS),  Hydropower  Office  (HPO),  and  Integrated \nWatershed Management Unit (IWMU); and the various sectoral interests balanced. This process \nshould  be  based  on  good  information,  planning  tools,  and  stakeholder  participation,  and \nintegrated with the decentralized and bottom-up approach to planning. The WRCCS is expected \nprimarily  to  coordinate  river  basin  planning,  although  with  the  establishment  of  sufficient \ntechnical  capacity  to  oversee  the  entire  process  and,  with  the  NNRB  Committee  (and  similar \nfuture  committees),  to  lead  the  process  of  stakeholder  consultation  and  conflict  resolution. \nSpecific outputs will include (i) development of detailed procedures and roles for WRCC, HPO, \nIWMU, river basin committees, and other key participants in the preparation of river basin plans, \nincluding  plan  approval  and  implementation  procedures;  and  (ii)  preparation  of  an  integrated \nmanagement plan for NNRB, and additional river basin plans, if appropriate. \n \n4. \nMost IWRM functions are new. Managers and technical staff need considerable training \nto  build  capacity  for  sustainable  implementation  of  IWRM.  Training  under  the  Project  is \nexpected  to  include  a  wide  range  of  activities  such  as  fellowships  for  staff  to  study  abroad, \ninternational study tours; support for dissertations by visiting scholars; workshops; and training \nin  English  language,  computer  skills,  management,  and  training  of  trainers.    The  WRCCS  will \n\n\fAppendix 11 \n\n45 \n\ncoordinate  IWRM  training  across  all  project  components;  and  activities  of  all  appropriate \nnational  ministries  and  agencies,  participating  provinces,  and  other  local  authorities  in  NNRB. \nThe  WRCCS  will  appoint  a  staff  person  to  serve  as  training  coordinator  and  will  need  an \ninterministry  working  group  or  coordinating  committee  on  training.  Activities  and  objectives \ninclude  (i)  assessing  training  needs  of  WRCC,  HPO,  IWMU,  NNRBC,  and  involved  provinces; \n(ii)  preparing  a  coordinated  training  plan;  (iii)  facilitating  implementation  of  the  training  plan, \ndrawing on training budgets under each project component; and (iv) evaluating training results \nand recommending ongoing training activities. \n \n5. \nCommunication  and  awareness  raising  involve  delivery  of  information  and  general \nknowledge,  often  to  broader  target  groups  than  in  training.  They  can  include  senior  officials, \nmanagers,  and  staff  who  are  only  indirectly  involved  in  water  resource  management,  water \nusers,  students  in  the  public  education  system,  and  the  general  public.  Communication  and \nawareness activities should be carried out according to a strategy that identifies target groups, \ntheir  information  and  awareness  needs,  and  priorities.  The  communication  and  awareness \nstrategy  should  indicate  how  project  activities  would  be  coordinated  with  other  ongoing  water, \nnatural resource, and environmental awareness activities such as through the mass media and \npublic  education  curricula.  Communication  activities  should  also  ensure  openness  and \ntransparency  in  IWRM  decision  making.  Activities  of  WRCC  and  other  agencies,  to  the  extent \npossible,  should  be  made  public.    Consultation  on  draft  policy  and  legal  decisions,  water \nresource  planning  scenarios,  and  similar  topics  should  be  carried  out  with  stakeholders.  \nSpecific  outputs  will  include  (i)  development  of  a  communication  and  awareness  strategy, \nincluding  communication  on  WRCCS  activities;  (ii)  communication  and  awareness  activities \naccording  to  the  agreed-on  strategy;  and  (iii)  training  and  other  capacity  building  for  ongoing \ncommunication and awareness activities. \n \nB. \n \n Both activities in this component are integrated such that river basin modeling provides \n6. \nthe  tool  for  the  reservoir  management  studies  and  will  be  managed  by  the  same  team  of \nconsultants.  The  consultants  will  work  in  close  coordination  with  HPO  counterpart  staff.  The \nmain  objective  of  this  component  is  to  provide  capacity  building  for  HPO  and  other  related \nagencies  in  configuring  and  calibrating  a  river  basin  model,  and  in  analyzing  and  interpreting \ndata  to  ensure  the  effective  use  of  the  model  as  a  planning  tool  to  operate  the  Nam  Ngum  1 \n(NN-1) reservoir. Any changed conditions in the river basin must be incorporated into the model. \nTrain-the-trainer courses in river basin modeling will be provided to support on-the-job training \nof domestic specialists and counterpart staff, who will train WRCCS, HPO (including Electricite \nDu Lao [EDL] staff and operators of NN-1), and MAF.    \n \n7. \nThe river basin modeling will, apart from capacity building, provide (i) a calibrated model \nfor  NNRB;  and  (ii)  agreed-on  bulk  sharing  of  the  water  resources  in  NNRB  with  the \nstakeholders,  which  will,  inter  alia,  give  EDL  a  clear  mandate  for  hydropower  generation  in \nNNRB  under  the  Water  Law.  After  identification  of  the  water  users,  collection  of  data,  and \nreview to ensure the quality of the data, the appropriate model will be selected and calibrated. In \nthe  modeling,  considerations  should  be  given  to  consistency  with  the  Mekong  River \nCommission\u2019s Water Utilization Program. The model will include the main water-using activities \nin NNRB, including hydropower, irrigation, flood mitigation, water supply, fisheries, and riverine \nenvironmental  maintenance.  Stakeholders  in  NNRB  will  be  consulted  on  development  and \nmanagement  scenarios  to  be  modeled,  and  on  the  results  of  the  modeling  for  agreement  on \nbulk  sharing.  The  results  will  take  into  account,  by  sensitivity  analyses,  changed  conditions  in \n\nReservoir Management and River Basin Modeling Component \n\n\f46 \n\nAppendix 11 \n\nWatershed Management Component \n\nNNRB, such as large-scale changes in watershed land use, significant irrigation developments, \nand implementation of other hydropower schemes. \n \n8. \nThe  reservoir  management  will,  apart  from  building  capacity,  (i)  provide  an  operational \nplanning  tool  for  NN-1,  for  long-term  (seasonal  and  monthly)  planning  for  hydropower \ngeneration, based on the concept of optimum use of the water resources within the agreed-on \nbulk  sharing,  and  for  short-term  (weekly  and  daily)  planning  of  the  reservoir  for  hydropower \ngeneration and flood mitigation; (ii) increase the knowledge of the various NNRB stakeholders \non  the  available  water  resources,  its  optimum  use,  and  the  economic  benefits  and  costs;  (iii) \nincrease  readiness  for  flood  mitigation,  and  understanding  of  flooding,  in  downstream  NNRB; \nand (iv) increase knowledge of the meteorological and hydrological conditions in the river basin. \nA  hydrodynamic  model  of  the  area  downstream  of  NN-1  will  enable  assessment  of  flood \nmitigation possibilities and consequences of flooding under various hydrological conditions. An \neconomic model, integrated with the river basin model, will enable assessment of benefits and \ncosts  of  various  water  uses  to  (i)  determine  optimum  use  of  the  water  resources,  and  (ii) \ndetermine economic viability of flood control operation of NN-1.   \n \nC. \n \n9. \nThe  main  thrust  of  this  component  is  transfer  of  appropriate  technology  to  farming \ncommunities  in  upper  NNRB.  Consultants  experienced  in  Lao  agriculture,  especially  with  the \ntried  and  tested  agricultural  extension  methodologies  in  the  successful  previous  projects,  will \nprovide  technical  services.  The  farming  system  approach  will  be  adopted  to  crop  productivity \nimprovement, effective and affordable interventions in livestock management, and joint forestry \nmanagement and forest restoration. Consultants will help provincial and district counterpart staff \n(i) design, develop, and implement on-farm demonstration trials; (ii) develop training programs \nand material for staff as well as community training, and impart training; and (iii) conduct project \nbenefit monitoring and evaluation.   \n \n10. \nCapacity Building for IWMU. A number of planning exercises have been undertaken, \nincluding investment plans for Nakai Nam Theun 2, Nam Ngum, and Nam Ou river basins; and \nforest  management \nintegrated  watershed \nmanagement in MAF has mainly been in developing concepts and guidelines, with some efforts \nin  capacity  building.  The  consultants  will  further  develop  the  conceptual  framework  and \nguidelines  based  on  experience  gained  through  additional  training  and  model  development. \nStaff capacity is still inadequate, especially at the district level. The consultant will help IWMU (i) \nbuild capacity for tasks ranging from basic communication and computer skills to planning and \ntechnical skills, (ii) coordinate a geographical information system in IWMU to support district and \nprovincial  integrated  watershed  planning,  (iii)  develop  detailed  subwatershed  plans  for  the \nProject,  and  (iv)  develop  skills  and  networking  to  ensure  that  IWRM  is  used  in  provincial-  and \ndistrict-level planning. \n \n11. \nCrop Productivity Improvement. Due to high rainfall in upper NNRB, rice is the main \ncrop  grown  on  flat  valley  beds  during  the  wet  season.  Improvement  in  rice  productivity  will \nencompass  testing  of  new  varieties,  determining  the  optimum  management  strategy  for  fields \nexposed to different water levels (slightly flooded, heavily flooded), as well as calibrating nutrient \nmanagement.  Farmers\u2019  decision \nlegumes,  or \nvegetables\u2014depends  on  the  level  of  rice  self-sufficiency  achieved  during  the  wet  season.  On \nsloping  uplands,  sweet  potatoes,  cassava,  and  horticulture  as  well  as  upland  rice  (on \nnonsloping land) will be tested. The potential of growing medicinal plants or new types of plants \nthat  have  been  proven  successful  elsewhere  in  the  country  (e.g.,  paper  mulberry)  will  also  be \n\nin  Vang  Vieng.  Until  recently,  progress \n\nto  produce  dry-season  crops\u2014maize, \n\nin \n\n\fAppendix 11 \n\n47 \n\ndetermined.  Crop  diversification  will  be  investigated.  Integrated  pest  management  techniques \nwill be adopted and calibrated for wider application in the subproject areas to safeguard water \nquality of inflows into Nam Ngum 1. To improve on-farm irrigation efficiencies, field trials will be \nconducted  and  appropriate  knowledge  imparted  to  beneficiaries.  The  possibility  of  micro-\nirrigation  will  also  be  explored.  For  rice  seed  multiplication,  a  structured  program  will  be \ndeveloped  in  close  consultation  with  farm  communities,  and  the  possibility  of  an  agribusiness \nand/or cooperative enterprise for seed production explored. The upper NNRB is envisaged as a \n\u201csemiprotected\u201d area, emphasizing organic farming to preserve the quality of its water resources \nand biodiversity.  \n \n12. \nLivestock Improvement. The consultants will develop (i) a farmer-based animal health \nprogram,  (ii)  village-based  extension  program  emphasizing  female  training,  and  (iii)  better \nlinkages with the market. Subwatershed livestock management committees will be established \nby building on existing rural institutions but ensuring that hitherto excluded groups (women and \nethnic minorities) are also included. Pilot program in schools will be developed and conducted to \ndevelop  greater  awareness  of  watershed  management  issues,  and  study  tours  to  other \nsubwatersheds  in  NNRB  and  elsewhere  in  the  country.  To  support  development  activities  in \nfisheries,  experts  will  collaborate  with  and  build  upon  the  experience  of  the  Provincial \nAquaculture  Development  Project  of  the  Food  and  Agriculture  Organization-United  Nations \nDevelopment  Programme.  The  experts  will  help  decentralize  hatcheries,  extend  village  fish \ntechnology,  and  develop  fish  cultivators  groups  in  existing  community-based  management \ngroups.  The  forage  and  feed  specialists  will  (i)  introduce  improved  forage  technologies  and \nmodifications  to  existing  grazing  practices,  emphasizing  managed  rather  than  free-range \ngrazing  of  cattle;  and  (ii)  help  farmers  utilize  better-quality  feed  by  demonstrating  weight-gain \nand  labor-saving  animal  programs.  The  animal  health  specialists  will  be  familiar  with  main \ninfectious  and  nutritional  diseases  in  ruminants  and  pigs  and  poultry.  The  specialists  will \ndevelop  and  help  implement  vaccination  programs  and  prepare  recommendations  to  control \nlivestock movements. \n \n13. \nForest  Restoration.  The  specialists  will  develop  a  joint  forest  management  program \nfor  sustainable  management  of  forests  and  nontimber  forest  products  (NTFPs)  with  the \nparticipating communities. The specialists will work with the counterpart staff and user groups to \n(i) develop a forest resource management strategy for the subprojects, based on national forest \nsector  development  plans  and  policies;  (ii)  involve  women  and  nongovernment  organizations; \n(iii)  promote  usufruct  sharing;  (iv)  set  up  demonstration  plots;  (v)  train  beneficiaries  in  NTFP-\nbased livelihood systems, covering NTFP regeneration, harvesting, processing, and marketing; \nand  (vi)  train  beneficiaries  in  area-specific  agroforestry  models  that  can  replace  shifting \ncultivation, including selection of agricultural crops and forest species, nursery techniques, and \nmanagement regimes. \n \nD. \n \n14. \nProject management consultants will support the Office of the National Project Manager \nby  (i)  developing  a  consolidated  work  plan;  (ii)  coordinating  project  implementation,  including \nadministrative, technical, and financial functions; (iii) ensuring that the social and environmental \nguidelines of the Government and ADB are followed in implementing project activities; and (iv) \nsupervising  the  project  benefit  monitoring  and  evaluation  program.  The  team  leader,  engaged \nunder the ADB package, will provide overall leadership for all project components and activities \nand  supervise  all  project  consultants,  including  those  engaged  under  the  AFD  package.  All \nconsultants  will  follow  a  consolidated  work  plan  to  ensure  effective  coordination  among  all \nproject components and activities. \n\nProject Management \n\n\f48 \n\nAppendix 11 \n\n \n \n\nTable A11: Packages for Consulting Services \n \n\n \nAFD Package \n\n(person-months)\n\nA.

The  annual \naverage rainfall ranges from 1,400-3,000 millimeter. Most of the 575,000 rural population1 in the \nupper watershed has a significant ethnic diversity and is highly mobile\u201460% move at least once \na  year.  Incidence  of  poverty  is  high  as  about  40%  of  the  population  reports  annual  rice \nshortages  for  four  months  or  longer.  Over  65%  of  the  rural  population  lives  below  the  poverty \nline  of  $11.20  per  capita  per  month.2  The  widespread  poverty  is  the  major  development \nchallenge, particularly in the upper NNRB. Poverty in NNRB is not synonymous with hunger. In \nthe past, abundant water resources provided sustenance for poor villagers but these resources \nare now dwindling and showing signs of overexploitation as more and more poor people search \nfor  food,  forest,  and  non-timber  forest  products  (NTFPs)  to  meet  health,  education,  and \nconsumption expenses. This Project will help address some of these problems in NNRB. \n \n2. \nThe optimal use of water resources in NNRB is the Project\u2019s long-term goal. The Project \nobjectives  are  to:  (i)  foster  integrated  water  resources  management  (IWRM)  among  the  line \nagencies  and  provincial  departments;  and  (ii)  support  investment  interventions  in  critical  and \ndegraded upper watersheds to (a) mitigate floods, (b) increase water use efficiency, (c) improve \nfarming  systems\u2019  productivity  to  ensure  food  security  and  increase  household  cash  incomes, \nand (d) preserve forests.  \n \nB. \n \n3. \nBenefits  would  be  generated  by  a  number  of  Project  activities.  At  the  national  level, \nProject benefits will arise from optimal use of water resources by institutionalizing IWRM. More \nefficient management of the Nam Ngum-1 (NN-1) reservoir will improve water conservation and \nmitigate floods. Other benefits will stem from the efficient use of water in agriculture leading to \nincreased  crop  productivity  and  household  incomes.  Adoption  of  improved  land-use  practices \nincluding forest development will maintain the water quality in the long run and add to household \nincomes.  At  the  grassroots  level,  integrated  agricultural  extension  activities  of  the  watershed \nmanagement component will target poor areas in upper NNRB. Major beneficiaries will include \nethnic groups and women. \n \n \n \n4. \nEach  of  the  three  Project  components  contains  capacity  building  activities.  IWRM \ncomponent  will  be  fully  utilized  to  strengthening  the  institutional  capacity  of  Water  Resources \nCoordination Committee. Although capacity building will generate significant benefits both in the \nshort-  as  well  as  in  the  long  run  but  direct  benefits  of  these  activities  cannot  be  quantified. \nSimilarly,  the  benefits  of  integrated  watershed  planning  will  improve  water  and  land  use \nefficiencies  and  help  implement  water  allocation  rights  but  the  intended  benefits  are  hard  to \nestimate. Therefore, the Project benefit stream does not include any estimate of such benefits. \nThe  approximate  cost  of  these  activities  amounts  to  about  25%  of  the  total  Project  cost. \n\nNonquantified Benefits \n\nProject Benefits \n\n1. \n\n                                                 \n1  This estimate does not include the population of Vientiane Municipality and surrounding plains that is estimated to \n\n2  The  Government  has  set  the  consumption  poverty  line  at  2100  kilocalories  per  capita  per  day  that  is  roughly \n\nbe another one million. \n\nequivalent to $11.20 per capita per month. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\nAppendix 12 \n\n51\n\nAlthough benefits of capacity building cannot be quantified but these activities are critical to help \nrealize the benefits of investments activities. For instance, proper planning and implementation \nof  sustainable  interventions  would  be  difficult  without  further  capacity  building  of  the  relevant \ndepartments.  Upper  watershed  management  planning  cannot  be  carried  out  without  due \nconsideration to reservoir management and river basin modeling parameters; and to coordinate \nboth these activities, IWRM has to be institutionalized. It is this interdependence of activities in \nall  three  components  that  is  critical  to  the  realization  of  overall  Project  benefits.  And  capacity \nbuilding is a prerequisite to successfully implement these activities. \n \n\n2. \n\nQuantified Benefits \n\nEvaluation Methodology and Assumptions  \n\n \n5. \nMost Project benefits will stem from two main sets of activities: (i) improved hydropower \ngeneration  as  a  result  of  better  reservoir  management;  and  (ii)  improved  watershed \nmanagement  through  integrated  agricultural  extension.  These  benefits  have  been  quantified \nand  included  in  the  benefit  stream.  The  approximate  cost  of  these  activities  amounts  to  about \n75% of the total Project cost. \n \nC. \n \n6. \nThe  analysis  draws  together  the  investment  costs  of  the  Project  during  six-year  \nimplementation  period  (2003-2008),  plus  the  recurrent  costs  needed  to  ensure  sustainable \nbenefits.  These  costs  are  then  compared  with  the  estimated  direct  benefits,  over  a  30-year \nperiod. Rice and maize have been valued at their border price equivalent of farmgate prices.3 All \nother  inputs  and  outputs,  have  been  valued  at  competitive  market  prices,  after  adjusting  for \ntaxes, duties and an implicit over-valuation of the exchange rate.4 A domestic price numeraire \nhas  been  used.  Base  costs  and  benefits  are  in  mid-2002  terms.  Tradable  goods  have  been \nconverted to their economic equivalent using a shadow exchange rate factor of 1.1. In the case \nof unskilled labor, a shadow wage rate factor of 0.6 has been used to reflect the opportunity cost \nof  labor  in  the  upper  watershed.  Both  these  macroeconomic  variables  have  been  estimated \nemploying  generally  accepted  assumptions  by  other  projects  and  sector  studies.  The  project \ninvestment  and  management  costs  are  estimated  at  $23.0  million.  In  economic  prices,  their \nequivalent  values  are  $22.4  million.  For  economic  analysis,  the  project  costs  cannot  be \nsegregated by component or by subproject because (i) many activities of all three components \noverlap, and (ii) activities and several fixed costs under the watershed management component \nare  non-divisible  (not  least  because  subproject  boundaries  cut  across  district  and  provincial \nboundaries).  Therefore,  this  analysis  has  been  carried  out  based  on  desegregated  cost  and \nconsolidated benefit streams for the whole Project. \n \n \n \nCurrently,  the  operational  rules  of  NN-1  reservoir  do  not:  (i)  optimize  hydropower \n7. \ngeneration  for  want  of  better  inflow  forecasting  and  absence  of  river  basin  modeling;  (ii) \nconsider downstream impacts on flooding in the Vientiane Plains during the wet season; and (iii) \nmeet  water  shortages  for  domestic  consumption  and  irrigation  during  the  dry  season.  The \nreservoir management and river basin modeling component will develop new operational rules \noptimizing  water  resources  in  the  whole  NNRB.  It  is  estimated  that  better  inflow  forecasting \ncould  result  in  2%  increase  in  annual  hydropower  generation  valued  at  $600,000.5  Every  four \n\nOptimal Reservoir Management \n\n1. \n\n                                                 \n3 All relevant detailed tables are provided in the Supplementary Appendix 2. \n4 In this analysis, the exchange rate of KN10,200/$1.0, prevalent at the time, has been used. \n5 This assumes an additional annual hydropower generation of 20 GWh valued at $0.03/kWh (for export to Thailand).  \n\n\f52 \n\n \n\nAppendix 12 \n\nyears  there  are  significant  floods  in  the  Mekong  River  and  its  tributaries  in  NNRB.  Backwater \nfrom Mekong River can cause flood damage independent of releases from the NN-1 reservoir. \nHowever,  uncoordinated  releases  of  water  from  NN-1  may  further  compound  flooding  in  the \nPlains  and  cause  damage  to  standing  crops,  private  property,  roads,  bridges,  power \ntransmission,  and  communications  infrastructure.  Improved  reservoir  management  rules  can \nmitigate  and/or  minimize  the  impact  of  such  floods  by  creating  an  optimum  buffer  in  the \nreservoir during the wet season. Since tangible benefits of flood mitigation from this activity at \nthis stage are difficult to estimate, therefore, they are not included in this analysis. The overall \nproject benefit stream, however, accounts for $600,000 from additional revenues from increased \nand optimized peak and off-peak hydropower generation. Half of these benefits are assumed to \nmaterialize in year 3, and full benefits from year 5 onward. \n \n\n2. \n\nIntegrated Agricultural Extension \n\n \n8. \nThe  bulk  of  Project  investments  will  be  made  for  the  watershed  management \ncomponent.  The  main  activities  under  this  component  will  provide  an  integrated  agricultural \nextension service to farming communities, mostly comprised of poor and ethnic groups, in the \nselected  subproject  areas.  The  farming  systems,  and  the  associated  constraints,  of  these \ncommunities  have  been  studied  in  detailed.  These  households  are  resource  poor  and  lack \nappropriate  technology  and  training  for  improved  farming  methods.  Food  shortages  for  3-4 \nmonths for poor households, inadequate cash income, and rising population compel households \nto overexploit forest resources of critical watersheds. \n \n9. \nCommunities  in  the  upper  watershed  have  complex  farming  systems.  Relatively  better \noff  households  have  access  to  some  farmland  on  the  valley  floors  with  wet  season\u2019s  residual \nirrigation. In some cases these households may also practice farming on upland slopes. Many \nhouseholds do not have access to land on valley floors and farm only in the uplands and they \noften  practice  shifting  cultivation.  Almost  all  households  raise  livestock  of  one  type  or  another \nand  also  harvest  NTFPs.  To  analyze  the  impact  of  integrated  agricultural  extension  service \nactivities  on  such  a  complex  set  of  farming  systems  is  just  as  complicated.  To  simplify  the \nanalytical  methodology,  only  two  farming  household  models,  one  for  lowland  and  one  for \nupland,  representing  typical  farm  sizes  and  land  use  in  the  subproject  areas  have  been \nprepared. Coefficients used for both models (farm size, cropping pattern, yields, and inputs) are \nbased on field surveys reported in the feasibility study and on subsequent discussions with staff \nof \nfor  Tropical \nAgriculture, and International Livestock Research Institute who are involved in ongoing projects \nin the country. \n\nthe  Lao-International  Rice  Research \n\nInstitute,  Lao-International  Center \n\n10. \nIn model 1, the lowland household has 0.5 ha of valley floor paddy land and 1.0 ha of \nupland.  Single  rain-fed  rice  crops  are  grown  on  each  class  of  land.  In  addition,  the  household \nfattens two pigs a year, collects NTFPs from about 2.0 ha and raises about 15 heads of poultry. \nFood  production  from  permanently  cropped  areas  is  supplemented  by  rice,  maize,  and \nvegetables  produced  from  about  1.2  ha  of  shifting  cultivation.  Under  the  Project,  land  use \nremains  the  same  except  that  0.2  ha  of  maize,  grown  on  residual  moisture  on  the  lowland,  is \nintroduced and the area of shifting cultivation falls to 0.7 ha as paddy yields increase. Changes \nin  the  crop  mix  allow  a  small  increase  in  the  number  of  pigs  fattened.  Poultry  losses  are \nassumed to fall as a result of Project activities while the value of NTFPs is expected to increase \nfollowing changes in resource management to be introduced. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\nAppendix 12 \n\n53\n\nBy contrast, in model 2, upland household has no valley floor paddy land and has 0.7 ha \n11. \nof  upland,  on  which  a  single  rainfed  rice  crop  is  grown.  Food  production  from  permanently \ncropped  areas  is  supplemented  by  rice,  maize,  and  vegetables  produced  under  shifting \ncultivation on about 2.0 ha a year. Two pigs are fattened and 10-15 head of poultry are raised \nevery year. Under the Project, land use on the upland area remains the same with a reduction in \nthe  shifting  cultivation  area  of  about  0.5  ha.  Changes  in  the  crop  production  allow  a  small \nincrease in the number of pigs fattened. Poultry losses are assumed to fall as a result of project \nactivities while the introduction of improved forest resource management is expected to result in \nan increase in the value of NTFPs. \n\n \n\na. \n\nCrop Productivity \n\n12. \nEach  household,  in  both  models,  is  assumed  to  have  the  equivalent  of  three  adults \navailable  for  farm  work  supplying  about  650  days  of  labor  a  year.  No  hiring  of  labor  is \nenvisaged.  In  some  areas,  families  may  hire  out  some  labor,  but  this  is  unlikely  to  exceed  30 \ndays  a  year.  Although  the  selected  five  subproject  areas  were  studied  in  more  detail  to  better \nunderstand  the  pattern  of  land  use,  social,  and  economic  constraints,  both  farm  models  have \nbeen generated and applied to the expected project area.   \n \n \n \n13. \nUnder  the  Project,  several  new  rice  varieties  and  management  practices  will  be \nintroduced.6 No chemical plant protection will be used and only minimal quantities of inorganic \nfertilizers  will  be  applied.  Crop  budgets  have  been  prepared  for  the  without  and  with-project \nscenarios. On permanently cropped areas, the assumption is made that yields are retained at \nexisting levels without-project with yield increases from new technology expected to be reached \nwithin 5 years of initial adoption. Shifting cultivation yields are assumed to decline by about 17% \nover 10 years, in without-project scenario. With the Project, lowland rice yields are assumed to \nincrease from 1.4 t/ha to 2.3 t/ha and those for upland from 1.2 t/ha to 1.9 t/ha. The yield of new \ncrop, maize, is assumed to be 2.7 t/ha. Current cropping intensity for both models is assumed to \nbe 100% and only for lowland Model 1, it is expected to increase to 113% with the Project. \n \n \n \nImproved  feeding  and  disease  control  for  small  animals  (pigs  and  poultry)  will  be  the \n14. \nmain  focus  of  project  interventions.  Feed  supplies  (primarily  by-products)  will  improve  as  crop \nyields improve and small additional areas of maize and other forage crops will be established on \nfarms. Better livestock management and vaccination programs for pigs and poultry will lead to a \nreduction in disease losses upto 40% and an improvement in growth rates.  \n\nLivestock Management \n\nb. \n\n \n\nc. \n\nForest Restoration \n\n \nAbout 6,000 households will participate in a range of forestry activities on about 9,000 ha \n15. \nto grow timber and fuelwood; cultivating and harvest NTFPs; and rehabilitate degraded forests. \nAgro-forestry will be practiced as a part of upland farming systems and supplement restocking \nof degraded forests in areas adjacent to villages. Farmers will be assisted to adopt sustainable \nextraction  practices  for  NTFPs  by  forming  user  groups  to  which  extraction  rights  for  specific \nareas  will  be  allocated.  This  approach  will  allow  forest  areas  to  be  rested,  a  requirement  if \ncurrent  extraction  rates  are  to  be  sustained.  As  crop  yields  on  more  settled  areas  improve, \nhouseholds are expected to gradually reduce shifting cultivation that will also contribute to more \nsustainable forest use. \n\n                                                 \n6 Lao-IRRI has nine modern rice varieties suitable for cultivation in the upper watershed areas. \n\n\f54 \n\n \n\nAppendix 12 \n\n \n\nd. \n\nOverall Benefits from Agricultural Extension \n\n \n \n16. \nIt  is  expected  that  about  10,000  households  (6,500  lowland  and  3,500  upland)  will \nbenefit from the integrated agricultural extension activities supported by the Project. Significant \nbenefits are assumed to start from year 2 with 1,000 households participating in the Project by \nthe  end  of  that  year.  Increasing  number  of  households,  i.e.,  2,500,  3,000,  and  3,500,  will \nparticipate in the subsequent 3 years. Increments in paddy and maize production of 11,590 tons \nand  3,395  tons,  respectively,  are  projected,  together  with  significant  increments  in  pig \nproduction,  forestry  products,  and  saved  poultry  losses.  Not  all  farmers  will  participate  in  all \nproject activities. Based on their current livelihood practices, most will participate in crop farming \nand livestock management and about 6,000 are expected to participate in forestry. \n\nThe  farm  budgets  described  above  have  been  used  to  estimate  incremental  farm \n17. \nhousehold  income  based  on  typical  land  use  and  activity  patterns.  Household  incomes,  at  full \ndevelopment  of  new  technologies,  show  substantial  increases  over  present  incomes  (Table \nA12.1).7  For  the  upland  model  2,  the  overall  annual  income  of  a  household  is  expected  to \nincrease  by  about  80%;  from  KN7,140,000  ($700)  to  KN12,954,000  ($1270).  The  non-cash \nincome is expected to increase from KN6,630,000 ($650) to KN9,537,000 ($935), an increase of \n34%, while the return per family day of labor would increase from KN5,000 ($0.49) per day to \nKN13,000 ($1.27) per day. It is expected that, on average, the annual cash income will increase \nby  5-6  fold;  from  KN510,000  ($50)  to  KN3,417,000  ($335).  Benefits  from  timber,  about  $40 \nmillion,  harvested  in  year  20  will  provide  an  additional  lump  sum  income  of  about  $6,600  per \nhousehold.  \n\nAt  the  household  level,  the  primary  objective  of  the  project  interventions  is  to  improve \n18. \nfood  security  for  the  beneficiaries.  Assuming  an  annual  per  capita  requirement  of  400  kg  of \npaddy  (equivalent  to  a  daily  per  capita  consumption  of  about  700  grams  of  rice)  and  a \nhousehold  size  of  7  persons,  the  annual  household  requirement  is  about  2,800  kg  of  paddy. \nWhile  this  amount  of  paddy  is  already  produced  on  the  lowland  farm  model  1,  the  sufficiency \nlevel is likely to vary considerably from year to year in response to weather conditions and pest \nand  disease  incidence.  The  upland  farm  model  2,  however,  only  produces  enough  paddy  for \nabout 10 months. With-project, it is envisaged that paddy production on the lowland farm model \n1 will increase to the extent that a marketable surplus will be available while paddy production \non the upland farm model 2 will increase to meet household requirements. \n\ne. \n\nEconomic Viability and Sensitivity Analysis \n\n \n19.  With the base case assumptions, the estimated economic internal rate of return (EIRR) \nis 24.7%. The EIRR and outcome of its sensitivity analysis are summarized in Table A12.2. In \nsummary, the EIRR is sensitive to a delay in benefit flows but rather less sensitive to changes in \ninvestment costs and to price changes in the main incremental outputs. If forestry benefits are \nexcluded, the EIRR remains above 12%. A reduction in the number of participating households \nfrom 10,000 to 8,000 results in the EIRR falling to 23.5%. \n\n \n\n \n\n                                                 \n7  In  this  appendix,  results  of  only  farm  model  2  have  been  presented.

All participating households will be able to produce \n\n\f56 \n\n \n\nAppendix 12 \n\n4. \n\n5. \n\nImpact on the Environment \n\nSustainability of Project Activities \n\nenough rice to ensure food security. The actual impact on poverty will likely be more than just \nincrease  in  household  incomes  as  Project  supported  beneficiary  training  will  assist  them  in \naccumulating social capital making them aware of further opportunities to better their lives. With \nadditional disposable cash income, they will be able to afford better education and health and \neven start small businesses. Ethnic groups and women will especially benefit from this Project \ngiven the nature of activities specifically targeted to address their needs. \n \n \n \n21. \nIncreased cash household incomes from livestock and sustainable harvesting of NTFPs \nwill  have  considerable  positive  impact  on  the  environment.  Degraded  forest,  covering  about \n30,000  ha,  will  be  restored.  Another,  25,000  ha  will  be  taken  out  of  shifting  cultivation  as \nparticipating households are able to increase their productivity from existing farmland. Overall, \nthe land use in these watersheds will become sustainable in the long run increasing their water \nconservation capacity considerably from current levels. \n \n \n \n22. \nGiven  the  nature  of  investment  interventions\u2014that  are  simple,  affordable,  and  do  not \nrequire  well-developed  input/output  markets  or  continuous  support  and  training\u2014Project \nactivities are expected to be sustainable in the long run. With appropriate support and training \nfarmers will get access to modern variety rice seed and improved farming practices. The seed of \nsame set of varieties could be multiplied within the village and shared. In the subsequent years, \nfarmers  would  know  the  value  of  improved  seed  and  the  know-how  about  where  and  how  to \nattain it. These modern rice varieties do not require chemical inputs\u2014pesticides and fertilizers\u2014\nto grow to their desired potential. Therefore, weak input markets in the subproject areas would \nnot  hamper  adoption  of  these  technologies.  Due  to  political  economy  of  rice  production  in  the \nregion, farmers would have no incentive to regularly grow surplus. Therefore, once food security \nis  achieved  they  would  tend  to  diversify  into  vegetables,  fruits,  etc.  Likewise,  lessons  from \nsimilar  projects  elsewhere  in  the  country  show  that  the  proposed  activities  for  livestock  and \nNTFP  management  would  be  sustainable  in  the  long  run  as  trained  farmer  groups  would  be \nable to carry on with these activities on their on even after Project completion. \n \nD. \n \n23. \nThe  financial  and  economic  evaluation  has  demonstrated  that  the  Project  design  is \nsound  and  viable.  The  estimated  base  case  EIRR  is  24.7%.  Significant  benefits  expected  to \narise  from  capacity  building  activities  in  all  three  components  cannot  be  quantified.  However, \ntheir impact on institutionalizing IWRM in the Government\u2019s planning and management systems \nand its resultant impact on optimal use of water resources will contribute significantly to national \neconomy  as  well  as  helping  in  materializing  the  impact  of  investment  activities.  Improved \nreservoir  management  will  result  in  significant  benefits  stemming  both  from  increased \nhydropower generation and flood mitigation. At the grassroots level, about 10,000 households, \nat  least  25%  of  them  below  the  poverty  line,  will  directly  benefit  from  Project  activities.  The \nincidence  of  shifting  cultivation  will  be  reduced  and  sustainable  forest  management  practices \nintroduced.  The  Project  benefits  have  been  estimated  employing  modest  assumptions. \nTherefore, the actual impact of the Project will most likely be much greater on poverty reduction, \nsustainable environmental management, and optimal use of water resources. \n\nConclusions \n\n\f", "author_pages": ["CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of  15 October 2002) \n", "Currency Unit\n", "kip (KN) \n", "\u2013 \n", "= \n= \n", "KN1.00\n$1.00\n", "$0.000095 \nKN10,500 \n", " \n \n", " \n \n", " \nADB \n \nAFD \nCPC \n \nDAFO   \n \nDFA \n \nFAO \n \nHPO \nHYV \n \nIWMU   \nJFPR   \nLao-IRRI \nLFNC   \n \nMAF \n \nMOF \nMIH \n \nNAFES \nNGO \n \nNNRB   \nNNWS  \nNTFP   \nONPM  \nPAFS   \nPIU \n \nPPMS   \nUNDP   \nWRCC  \nWRCCS \n \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "ABBREVIATIONS \n", "Asian Development Bank \nAgence Francaise de Developpement \nCommittee for Planning and Cooperation \nDistrict Agriculture and Forestry Office \ndevelopment funding agency \nFood and Agriculture Organization \nHydropower Office \nhigh yielding variety \nIntegrated Water Management Unit \nJapan Fund for Poverty Reduction \nLao-International Rice Research Institute \nLao Front for National Construction \nMinistry of Agriculture and Forestry \nMinistry of Finance \nMinistry of Industry and Handicraft \nNational Agriculture and Forestry Extension Service \nNongovernment Organization \nNam Ngum River Basin \nNam Ngum Watershed \nNontimber Forest Products \nOffice of National Project Manager \nProvincial Agriculture and Forestry Service \nProject Implementation Unit \nproject performance management system \nUnited Nations Development Programme \nWater Resources Coordination Committee \nWRCC Secretariat \n", "NOTES \n", " \n", " \n", " \n", " \n", " \n \n", " \n", " \n \n", " \n", "(i) \n(ii) \n", "The fiscal year (FY) of the Government ends on 30 September.  \nIn this report, \"$\" refers to US dollars. \n", " \n \n \nThis Report was prepared by a team consisting of A.
