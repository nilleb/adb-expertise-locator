It  will  contribute  to  the  economic \nintegration  of  selected  rural  communities,  which  make  up  about  10%  of \nthe  total  rural  population,  by  improving  high-priority  rural  feeder  roads \ntotaling  about  220  kilometers  (km)  connected  to  the  national  road \nnetwork.  It  will  also  strengthen  transport  sector  management.  The \nproposed  supplementary \nthe \nconstruction of rural feeder roads. \n \nThe  Government  of  Armenia  is  committed  to  the  development  of  road \ntransport,  which  currently  services  98%  of  passenger  traffic  and  66%  of \nfreight  traffic.  The  Project  is  a  Government  priority  and  will  improve  the \nsocioeconomic  conditions  of  the  rural  population  by  rehabilitating  rural \nroads  in  line  with  the  Government\u2019s  poverty  reduction  strategy  paper.\nThe Project will also help the Government to meet its plans to complete \nthe rehabilitation of secondary roads and bridges by 2015.  \n \nThe  Project  was  approved  on  28  September  2007  and  procurement \nactivities  started  in  early  2008  as  scheduled.  The  invitation  for  bid  for \npackage  1  (10  lots  totaling  about  109  km)  was  issued  on  23  April  2008 \nunder  international  competitive  bidding  procedures  (single-stage,  one-\nenvelope),  following  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as  amended \nfrom time to time) and standard bidding documents. On 6 June 2008, the \nbids were received by the Executing Agency and were evaluated. The bid \nevaluation  report  was  submitted  to  ADB  for  approval  on  24  June  2008. \nThe total bid amount for the 10 lots was about $23.57 million, 45% higher \nthan  the  cost  estimated  at  appraisal  in  2006.  The  contracts  have  been \nsigned and are under implementation. Package 2 (about 118 km) is being \nfinalized and will be ready for bidding at the end of October 2008.  \n \nThe Project would face further implementation delays if the cost overruns \nin  the  civil  works  components  are  not  redressed  soon.  A  sharp  price \nescalation in material costs, the depreciation of the US dollar against the \nArmenian dram, and domestic inflation were the main factors contributing \n\n \n\n\fii \n\n \n\nImpact and \nOutcome \n\nRevised Project \nInvestment Plan \n \n \nRevised Financing \nPlan \n\n \n\nto the Project\u2019s cost overruns.  \n \nThe  Project  scope  remains  the  same.  The  impact  and  outcome  of  the \nproposed supplementary loan will be consistent with the Project. Its impact \nwill  be  an  improvement  in  the  income  and  non-income  dimensions  of \npoverty  in  rural  areas  in  four  project  regions,  serving  about  10%  of  the \ncountry\u2019s  total  rural  population.  The  outcome  will  be  increased  mobility \nand better access to basic social service delivery institutions, employment \nopportunities,  and  domestic  and  international  markets  for  communities \nand enterprises in the four regions. The feeder roads improved under the \nProject  will  lead  to  (i)  higher-quality  and  more  frequent  road  transport \nservices; (ii) more business opportunities for the private sector in general, \nparticularly agriculture (including agro-processing), industry, and services; \nand (iii) benefits from close partnerships with other donors in the road and \nother sectors relevant to the Project.  \n \nThe  revised  investment  cost  of  the  Project  is  estimated  at  $64.84  million \nequivalent,  including  taxes  and  duties,  physical  and  price  contingencies, \ninterest and other charges. \n\n \nRevised Project Financing Plan \n($ million) \n\n \n \nSource \nAsian Development Bank \nGovernment of Armenia \n\n \nBasea \n30.60 \n10.80 \n41.40 \na  Base = as stated in Asian Development Bank. 2007.

The  loan  will  have  a  31-year  term,  including  a \ngrace period of 7 years, an interest charge of 1.0% per annum during the \ngrace  period,  and  1.5%  per  annum  thereafter.  As  the  original  loan  and \nproposed  supplementary  loan  are  from  the  Asian  Development  Fund \nloan  will  be \n(ADF),  repayments  of \nsynchronized with those of the original loan. \n \nAs part of the performance-based allocations for ADF, Armenia is able to \navail  of  additional  ADF  resources  in  the  amount  of  SDR11,201,000 \n($17.32  million  equivalent).  The  Government  has  requested  ADB  to \nprovide additional resources to finance the increased costs of the original \nproject  scope.  As  the  Project  is  a  Government  priority,  there  is  a  strong \njustification for the proposed supplementary loan. \n \n \n\nthe  proposed  supplementary \n\n\fUntil 30 June 2011 \n\nPeriod of \nUtilization \n \nEstimated  Project \nCompletion Date \n \nExecuting Agency  Ministry of Transport and Communications (the Executing Agency for the \n\n \n31 December 2010 \n\n \n\n \n\niii\n\nis \n\nthe \n\nRural Road Sector Project). \n \nThe  Armenian  Roads  Directorate \nImplementing  Agency. \nThe existing project management unit is providing support for the day-to-\nday coordination and implementation of the Project. \n \nThe  existing  procurement  plan  was  updated  with  the  revised  contract \nvalues. The ADB-financed contracts (package 2) under the Project will be \nprocured  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines.  Package  2 \n(civil works contracts) will be carried out by using international competitive \nbidding procedures and the post-qualification method as described in the \nprocurement plan for the original project. \n \nThere is no need for advance contracting or retroactive financing. \n\nThe negotiation for the construction supervision consultant\u2019s contract took \nplace  in  April  2008.  The  supervision  consulting  contract  approved  by  the \nGovernment  funded  by  the  original  loan  covers  all  necessary  tasks  and \ngoals  of  supervision.  Therefore,  no  supplementary  consulting  services \n(known  in  Armenia  as  \u2018\u2019supervision  by  the  author\u2019\u2019)  are  needed  or \nenvisaged under the proposed supplementary loan. \n \nThe Project will provide long-term sustainable savings in vehicle operating \ncosts  and  travel  time  stemming  from  the  physical  improvements,  and \ndevelopment of improved transport and road management systems in the \nrural areas covering four regions. \n \nThe  major  risks  identified  in  the  original  loan  (project  implementation \ndelays and low quality of works) still apply to the proposed supplementary \nloan.  The  ongoing  packages  are  experiencing  implementation  delays \nbecause  of  the  Project\u2019s  cost  overruns  and  the  prolonged  approval \nprocess  for  contracts  by  the  Government.  The  proposed  supplementary \nloan  will  help  expedite  the  implementation  of  the  Project.  However,  if \nthere are any further increase in prices of commodities, the Government \nmight  reduce  some  subprojects  through  a  change  in  scope,  or  will \nfinance the additional cost from its own resources. \n \n\n \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\nProcurement \n\nAdvance \nContracting and \nRetroactive \nFinancing \n \nConsulting \nServices \n\nProject Benefits \nand Beneficiaries \n\nRisks and \nAssumptions \n\n \n\n\fo\n44  00'E\n\no\n46  00'E\n\nREPUBLIC OF ARMENIA\nRURAL ROAD SECTOR PROJECT\n\nG E O R G I A\n\no\n\n41  00'N\n\n.\nR\n \nn\na\ny\nr\nu\nh\nk\nA\nAmasia\n\nTashir\n\nAlaverdi\n\ne\n\nb\n\ne\n\nD\n\nd   R .\nNoyemberyan\n\nAyrum\n\nStepanavan\n\nLORI\n\nToumanyan\n\nSpitak\n\nGyumri\n\nVanadzor\n\nSHIRAK\n\nDilijan\n\nIjevan\n\nBerd\n\nTAVUSH\n\nArpacay\nLake\n\nArtik\n\nMaralik\n\nAparan\n\nHrazdan\n\nSevan\n\nChambarak\n\nArtsvashen\n\nAZERBAIJAN\n\no\n\n41  00'N\n\nTalin\n\nAragats\n\nARAGATSOTN\n\nCharentsavan\n\nYeghvard\n\n.\n\nR\n \nn\na\nd\nz\na\nr\nH\n\nNorhachn\n\nAbovyan\n\nGavar\n\nAshtarak\n\nVagharshapat\n\nArmavir\n\nARMAVIR\n\nPampak\n\nSevana\nLake\n\nMartuni\n\nGEGHARKUNIK\n\nKOTAYK\n\nYeranos\n\nVardenis\n\nSotk\n\nYEREVAN\nYEREVAN\n\nMasis\n\nAraz River\n\nARARAT\n\nArtashat\n\nVedi\nArarat\n\nYeraskh\n\nTURKEY\n\nJermuk\n\nYeghegnadzor\n\nVayk\n\nGoraik\n\nVAYOTSDZOR\n\nI R A N\n\nN\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\nAZERBAIJAN\n\no\n39  00'N\n\nKilometers\n\nNational Capital\n\nOblast Capital\n\nCity/Town\n\nProject Road\n\nMain Highway\n\nSecondary Road\n\nRailway\n\nRiver\n\nOblast Boundary\n\nInternational Boundary\n\nBoundaries are not necessarily authoritative.\n\no\n44  00'E\n\no\n46  00'E\n\nAngeghakot\n\nSisian\n\nGoris\n\nV\n\no\n\nrota\n\nn R.\n\nSYUNIK\n\nKajaran\n\nKapan\n\no\n39  00'N\n\nMeghri\n\n  R i v e r\n\nA r a z\n\nI R A N\n\n08-4083 HR\n\n\f \n\n \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n1. \nI  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  report  and  recommendation  on  a  proposed \nsupplementary loan to  Armenia for the Rural  Road Sector Project. The design and monitoring \nframework is in Appendix 1. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE APPROVED PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nProject Rationale \n\n2. \nIn  response  to  the  challenges  created  by  deficiencies  in  the  road  infrastructure,  the \nGovernment  of  Armenia  has  developed  a  road  policy  to  2015,  focusing  on  rehabilitation  and \nmaintenance  of  existing  roads  in  line  with  the  Government\u2019s  poverty  reduction  strategy  paper \n(PRSP).1 The Government adopted three strategic goals for road infrastructure development for \n2006\u20132015:  (i)  maintenance  and  improvement  of  the  main  road  network  to  enhance  the \ncountry\u2019s  business  competitiveness  and  support  the  economy,  (ii)  improvement  to  the \nsocioeconomic  conditions  of  the  rural  population  through  the  rehabilitation  of  rural  roads,  and \n(iii) improvement to traffic safety. The Government plans to (i) complete the rehabilitation of old \nbridges  and  other  ancillary  facilities  along  the  main  highways  by  2010,  (ii)  complete  the \nrehabilitation of secondary roads and bridges by 2015, (iii) meet rural road transport demands in \na cost-effective manner, and (iv) ensure road safety throughout all road categories. \n \n3. \nInefficient  infrastructure  is  one  of  the  main  causes  of  poverty,  so  rural  infrastructure \ndevelopment  is  a  cornerstone  of  the  Government\u2019s  poverty  reduction  strategy  paper.  The \nGovernment  has  also  prepared  a  rural  infrastructure  investment  program.  With  World  Bank \nassistance,  the  Government  launched  a  Lifeline  Road  Network  Program  (LRNP)  in  2004  to \nimprove the access of rural communities to the national highway system throughout the country. \nThe  Project  targets  improving  784  high-priority  rural  feeder  roads  (secondary  and  local  roads) \ntotaling about 2,700 kilometers (km). The Project is a Government priority.  \n \nB. \n\nObjectives and Scope \n\nIn  July  2007,  the  Government  and  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  reached  an \n4. \nagreement  on  the  impact,  outcome,  outputs,  cost  estimates  and  financing  plan,  and \nimplementation arrangements of the Rural Road Sector Project (the Project) and on the original \nloan  for  the  Project.2   The  Project  will  upgrade  up  to  about  220  km  of  high-priority  asphalt \nconcrete roads. The main project outcome will be increased mobility and more access to basic \nsocial  services,  employment  opportunities,  and  domestic  and  international  markets  for \ncommunities and enterprises in rural and urban areas of the four regions. The Project consists \nof  (i)  a  road  connectivity  improvement  component;  and  (ii)  a  road  infrastructure  management \ncomponent,  comprising  (a)  road  design,  subproject  preparation,  and  construction  supervision; \nand (b) project management. The feeder roads improved under the Project will lead to (i) higher-\nquality  and  more  frequent  road  transport  services;  (ii)  more  business  opportunities  for  the \nprivate  sector,  particularly  agriculture  (including  agro-processing),  industry,  and  services;  and \n(iii) benefits from close partnerships with other donors in the road and other sectors relevant to \nthe Project.  \n \n \n\n                                                 \n1  World Bank \u2013 Yerevan. 2003.

The  project  management  unit \n(PMU)  in  the  Executing  Agency,  the  Ministry  of  Transport  and  Communications  (MOTC),  has \nbeen established and is fully operational. Procurement started in early 2008. The invitation for \nbid  for  package  1  (10  lots  totaling  about  109  km)  was  issued  on  23  April  2008  under \ninternational  competitive  bidding  (ICB)  procedures  (single-stage,  one-envelope),  following \n\n \nD. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n3\n\nADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2007  as  amended  from  time  to  time)  and  standard  bidding \ndocuments.  On  6  June  2008,  the  bids  were  received  by  the  Executing  Agency  and  were \nevaluated. The bid evaluation report was submitted to ADB for approval on 24 June 2008. The \ntotal bid amount for the 10 lots was about $23.57 million, 45% higher than the cost estimated at \nappraisal in 2006. The contracts have been signed and are being implemented. Package 2 (13 \nlots totaling about 118 km) is being finalized and will be ready for bidding at the end of October \n2008.  The  contract  negotiation  for  the  construction  supervision  consultant  (for  subproject \npreparation \ntechnical,  environmental,  economic,  and  social  and \nresettlement  due  diligence)  took  place  in  April  2008.  The  contract  has  been  approved  by  the \nGovernment  and  is  being  funded  by  the  original  loan.  The  consultant  has  commenced  its \nservices. \n \n\nincluding  design  and \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED SUPPLEMENTARY LOAN \n\nA. \n\nCost Overruns \n\n8. \nThe proposed supplementary loan will finance the increase in the project costs resulting \nfrom  (i)  price  increases;  (ii)  domestic  inflation;  and  (iii)  the  appreciation  of  the  Armenian  dram \n(see Appendix 2). \n \n9. \nThe total bid amount for package 1 (10 lots) is about $23.57 million, 45% higher than the \ncost estimated at appraisal in 2006 and about 1.1% less than the revised cost estimate made in \nFebruary 2008. Package 2 (13 lots totaling about 118 km) is being finalized and is expected to \nbe ready for bidding at the end of October 2008. As of 9 July 2008, the first cost estimate was \n98% higher than that at appraisal, principally because of increases in the cost of raw materials \nand  oil.  The  cost  estimate  will  be  reassessed  and  known  before  package  2  bidding  process \nstarts. Details of packages 1 and 2 are given in Appendix 3. Since appraisal (December 2006) \nthe  cost  of  the  following  items  has  increased  substantially:  (i)  bitumen  by  41%,  (ii)  aggregate \nstones by 55%, (iii) diesel and fuel by 81%, (iv) reinforcing steel by 111%, (v) cement by 36%, \nand (vi) labor per man-hour by 91%. \n \n10. \nThe  increase  in  project  costs  has  also  resulted  from  domestic  inflation  and  an \nappreciation of the Armenian dram. Inflation is expected to grow to over 6% in 2008, compared \nwith 4.4% in 2007. As of the time of writing, the annual average inflation rate was 9%. The dram \nhas appreciated by about 16% since December 2006 (the time of appraisal), from AMD364.84 \nto $1 to AMD307.13 to $1 in May 2008. \n \nB. \n\nImpact on the Project \n\n11. \nThe cost overruns have posed a major risk to the timely and successful completion of \nthe  Project.  The  proposed  supplementary  loan  will  support  the  achievement  of  the  original \nproject  objectives,  outcomes,  and  main  outputs,  which  are  to  rehabilitate  about  220  km  of \nrural roads.  \n \nC. \n\nRationale \n\nThe  proposed  supplementary \n\n12. \nfor \nsupplementary  financing. 3  The  proposed  supplementary  loan  is  to  cover  the  project  cost \noverrun.

The  Project  will  support  the  Government  to  complete  the  rehabilitation  of \nsecondary roads and bridges by 2015. However, the cost overrun has jeopardized the Project, \nincreasing  the  risk  of  delays  in  implementation.  This  is  a  strong  need  for  ADB  to  provide \nsupplementary financial assistance to the Government to ensure that the Project is completed \non time and successfully. \n \n13.  MOTC (the Executing Agency), and the Armenian Roads Directorate4 (the Implementing \nAgency)  are  in  place  and  fully  operational.  Package  1  was  procured  through  ICB  procedures \nwith post-qualification, as described in the Project\u2019s procurement plan. The contracts have been \nsigned and implementation has started. The supervision consultant has commenced its services. \nThe ongoing activities are in compliance with ADB\u2019s safeguards requirements. \n \nD. \n\nRevised Cost Estimate \n\n14. \nThe  revised  project  cost  is  estimated  at  $64.84  million,  including  taxes  and  duties, \nphysical and price contingencies, interest and other charges. This is an increase of 56.6% over \nthe original cost estimate. The revised project investment plan is in Table 3.

The  loan  will  have  a  31-year  term,  including  a  grace  period  of  7  years,  an  interest \ncharge  of  1.0%  per  annum  during  the  grace  period,  and  1.5%  per  annum  thereafter.  The \nGovernment will provide $6.12 million equivalent in counterpart funds. As the original loan and \nproposed supplementary loan are from the Asian Development Fund (ADF), repayments of the \nproposed  supplementary  loan  will  be  synchronized  with  those  of  the  original  loan.  The  total \nfinancing percentages are the same as those in the original loan. The revised project financing \nplan is in Table 4. \n                                                 \n4  A  noncommercial  state  organization  responsible  for  planning  and  management  of  road  construction  and \n\nmaintenance work for the road assets under MOTC\u2019s purview. \n\n5  As  part  of  the  performance-based  allocations  for  the  Asian  Development  Fund,  Armenia  is  able  to  avail  of \n\nadditional ADF resources in the amount of SDR11.201 million (about $17.32 million equivalent). \n\n \n\n\f \n\n5\n\nTable 4: Revised Project Financing Plan \n($ million) \n \n\n \n\nSource \nAsian Development Bank \nGovernment of Armeniab \n\nTotal \n\nBasea \n30.60 \n10.80 \n41.40 \n\nAmounts \nSup \n17.32 \n6.12 \n23.44 \n\nTotal \n47.92 \n16.92 \n64.84 \n\n \n% \n73.9 \n26.1 \n100.0 \n\nBase = original loan, Sup = Supplementary loan. \na  ADB. 2007.

The estimated cost for package 2 (para. 9) \nwill be reassessed before the next bidding. However if there are any further increases in prices \nof commodities, the Government might reduce some subprojects through a change in scope \nor finance the cost increase.  \n \nG. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n1. \n\nProject Management \n\n17. \nAs for the original loan, MOTC is the Executing Agency and Armenian Roads Directorate \n(ARD) is the Implementing Agency responsible for planning, implementation, and supervision of \nthe Project. Within ARD, a PMU has been established to manage the day-to-day coordination, \nimplementation,  and  administration  of  the  Project,  including  (i)  selection  and  assessment  of \nsubprojects, (ii) maintenance of project accounts, (iii) support for the procurement of equipment \nand  materials,  (iv)  monitoring  and  reporting  on  subproject  implementation,  (v)  facilitation  of \nenvironmental  and  social  protection  measures,  (vi)  detailed  design  supervision,  and  (vii) \nconstruction  supervision.  The  PMU  will,  on  a  quarterly  basis  or  more  often  as  required,  meet \nwith  each  organization, 6  which  it  considers  appropriate,  to  discuss  and  coordinate  the \nimplementation of the Project. The PMU will further discuss all issues to be addressed with such \nother entities in accordance with the terms of the project administration memorandum agreed to \nbetween the Borrower and ADB. The PMU will be maintained until project completion.  \n \nIn  accordance  with  the  Government\u2019s  requirements  for  externally  funded  projects, 7  \n18. \nMOTC  is  assisted  by  a  project  governing  council  (PGC).  The  PGC  is  an  interministerial  and \ninterdepartmental  body  consisting  of  representatives  from  the  Ministry  of  Finance,  Ministry  of \nJustice,  MOTC,  Ministry  of  Territorial  Administration,  and  civil  society  representatives  of  the \nproject  beneficiaries.  The  PGC  is  chaired  by  the  minister  of  MOTC.  The  PGC  operates  in \n\n                                                 \n6  Such  as  the  Millennium  Challenge  Organization,  the  Lincy  Foundation,  ASIF  (Armenia  Social  Investment  Fund, \nfinanced  by  the  World  Bank),  JICA  [Japan  International  Cooperation  Agency,  concessional  loan  operations  of \nJapan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC) were integrated into the operations of Japan International Agency \n(JICA)  on  1  October  2008],  UNAIDS  (Joined  United  Nations  Programme  on  HIV/AIDS),  USAID  (United  States \nAgency for International Development), and UNDP (United Nations Development Programme). \n\n7  Armenia. 1999.

The PGC will be maintained until project completion.  \n\nThe Project will be implemented over 3 years, with an estimated project completion date \n\n \n2. \n\nImplementation Period \n\n19. \non 31 December 2010.  \n \n\n3. \n\nProcurement \n\n20 \nPackage 1 was procured in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines, using ADB \nstandard  bidding  documents  under  ICB  procedures  with post-qualification,  as  described  in  the \noriginal  Project\u2019s  procurement  plan.  Package  2  will  be  procured  under  the  same  procedures. \nThe  procurement  plan  was  revised  because  of  increases  in  costs  and  a  minor  difference  in \nlength8 (km) of certain rural roads (lots). The revised plan is in Appendix 5. \n \n21. \nThe  Government  currently  imports  bitumen  required  for  road  improvement  from  non-\nADB  member  countries.  Restricting  bitumen  procurement  to  ADB  member  countries  may \npreclude civil works contractors under the Project from obtaining the best economic terms, and \nmay  seriously  erode  economic  efficiency.  The  Board  of  Directors  of  ADB  has  approved  the \nproposal that bitumen procured from non-member countries of ADB for civil works be eligible for \nfinancing  under  the  Project  during  the  consideration  of  the  original  loan.  It  is  proposed  that \nbitumen procured from non-member countries of ADB for civil works under the Project be also \neligible for financing from the proposed supplementary loan. \n \n\n4. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n22. \nThe  supervision  consultant  was  engaged  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the \nUse of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). The consultant is funded under the \noriginal loan and has commenced its services. \n \n\n5. \n\nAdvance Contracting and Retroactive Financing \n\nAdvance  contracting  and  retroactive  financing  are  not  necessary  under  the  proposed \n\n23. \nsupplementary loan. \n\n6. \n\nAnticorruption Policy \n\nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \n24. \nwith  the  Government  including  the  Executing  Agency  and  the  Implementing  Agency  and \nincluded  in  the  bidding  documents.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance, \naccountability,  and  transparency,  ADB  reserves  the  right  to  investigate,  directly  or  through  its \nagents,  any  alleged  corrupt,  fraudulent,  collusive,  or  coercive  practices  relating  to  the  Project. \nTo support these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the \nloan regulations and the bidding documents for the Project. In particular, all contracts financed \nby ADB in connection with the Project have included provisions specifying the right of ADB to \naudit  and  examine  the  records  and  accounts  of  the  Executing  Agency,  and  all  contractors, \nsuppliers, consultants, and other service providers as they relate to the Project. \n                                                 \n8  Increases  or  decreases  in  length  are  due  to  the  difference  between  the  first  designs  (undertaken  at  time  of \n\nappraisal) and the detailed final designs used for the bidding process and the implementation. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n7\n\n7. \n\nFinancial Management \n\n25. \nARD,  which  is  responsible  for  the  flow  of  funds,  accounting,  reporting,  and  auditing,  is \nmanaging  project  finances.  ARD  has  acceptable  financial  management  arrangements:  \n(i) accounting and reporting are performed with the use of appropriate software, which supports \na reliable and flexible system of recording and reporting with the required details and formats;  \n(ii) the bookkeeping system allows systematic storing of all supporting financial documentation \nrelating to the Project; (iii) the internal control system is adequate; and (iv) accounting staff have \nextensive  experience  of  World  Bank  procedures  for  disbursement  and  financial  management \nunder  the  two  road  projects  financed  by  the  World  Bank,  including  financial  management \nreports.  \n \n\n8. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n26. \nThere were four conditions for disbursements under the original loan. These have been \ncomplied  with.  The  proceeds  from  the  proposed  supplementary  loan  will  be  disbursed  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time) \nand  in  accordance  with  the  arrangements  for  the  original  loan.  ARD  manages  the  imprest \naccount,  which  was  opened  at  a  bank9 acceptable  to  ADB  and  is  exclusively  used  to  finance \nADB\u2019s share of eligible expenditures as stipulated in the original loan. \n \n\n9. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n27. \nARD  will  submit  quarterly  and  annual  progress  reports  to  ADB,  through  MOTC.  These \nreports will indicate progress made and problems encountered during the review periods, steps \ntaken  to  remedy  the  problems  or  proposed  countermeasures,  the  proposed  activities,  and \nexpected progress during the following periods. Within 3 months of physical completion of the \nProject,  MOTC  will  submit  to  ADB  a  project  completion  report  providing  details  on \nimplementation, costs, benefits, and other information that ADB may request. \n \n28. \nARD  is  maintaining  separate  accounts  and  financial  statements  for  the  Project,  which \nwill be audited annually by international independent auditors acceptable to ADB. Auditors will \nbe selected and engaged by quality- and cost-based selection or the consultants\u2019 qualifications \nselection method, in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. Annual audit \nreports will include an opinion on the use of the loan proceeds and compliance with the financial \ncovenants  included  in  the  loan  agreements,  if  any,  including  the  use  of  imprest  accounts  and \nstatement  of  expenditures  procedures.  ARD  will  provide  ADB  with  audit  reports  in  English, \ntogether with audited accounts and financial statements, no later than 6 months after the end of \neach fiscal year. \n \n29. \nThe  Government  was  informed  of  ADB\u2019s  policy  on  submission  of  audited  accounts, \nwhich  covers  failure  to  submit  audited  accounts  and  financial  statements  by  due  dates.  \nIf submission of a financial statement is delayed by more than 6 months (i) no commitment letter \nwill be issued, if applicable; and (ii) ADB may not approve new contact awards. If the delay is \nmore than 12 months, loan disbursements may be suspended or the loans may be canceled. \n \n\n10. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\nThe  PMU,  assisted  by  the  consultant  for  subproject  preparation  and  construction \n30. \nsupervision,  will  establish  a  systematic  project  performance  monitoring  system  to  monitor  and \n                                                 \n9  ARDSHININVESBANK \u201cCJSC\u201d, Yerevan Branch, 4 Vazgen Sargsyan St. 0010 Yerevan, Republic of Armenia. \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nevaluate  the  impacts,  outcomes,  outputs,  and  activities  in  relation  to  the  targets  and \nbenchmarks set for each subproject and the Project. \n \n\n11. \n\nStakeholder Participation and Consultations \n\n31.  MOTC and ARD have conducted public consultations with nongovernment organizations \nand local governments in the region of Armavir and in Yerevan, to which all others regions were \ninvited.  The  stakeholders  involved  in  the  consultations  have  expressed  strong  support  for  the \nproposed supplementary loan. \n \n\n12. \n\nProject Reviews \n\n32. \nIn addition to regular reviews by ADB, a midterm review of project implementation will be \ncarried  out  during  2009.  Representatives  of  ADB  and  the  Government  will  take  part  in  the \nreview,  which  is  designed  to  focus  on  impacts\u2014particularly  those  relating  to  institutional, \nadministrative,  organizational,  technical,  environmental,  and  social  aspects\u2014and  poverty \nreduction.  Other  parameters  that  might  negatively  affect  the  economic  viability  and  other \naspects  of  the  Project  will  be  assessed  during  the  review,  which  will  allow  for  any  necessary \nmidterm adjustments. \n \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\nA. \n\nEconomic Benefits \n\n33. \nThe  economic  internal  rates  of  return  (EIRR)  were  recalculated  for  each  rural  road \nsubproject.  Each  subproject  EIRR  was  subjected  to  a  sensitivity  analysis  and  risk  analysis  of \nkey  adverse  variables.  Four  subprojects  (2  under  package  1  and  2  under  package  2)  have \nEIRRs ranging from 4% to 8%. The subprojects under package 1 are committed. For package \n2, the concerned 2 subprojects will be closely reviewed on the basis of their economic viability.  \nThe  combined  EIRR  was  revised  to  34%  from  the  original  estimated  43%.  As  a  result,  the \nProject\u2019s EIRR is highly robust, despite a large increase in the economic investment cost. This \nvalidates  earlier  sensitivity  analyses  under  the  original  loan,  which  estimated  ample  switching \nvalues  required  to  reduce  the  Project\u2019s  net  present  value  to  zero.  The  revised  economic \nanalysis is in Appendix 6.  \n \nB. \n\nProject Sustainability \n\nSocial and Poverty Impacts \n\nThe  Government  has  increased  road  budgets  and  is  committed  to  providing  adequate \n\n34. \nfunds to maintain the roads after the improvements.  \n \nC. \n \n35. \nThe  Project  will  improve  income  and  non-income  dimensions  of  poverty  in  rural  areas. \nThe Project\u2019s impact on poverty has been quantified by examining the share of total project net \nbenefits  that  would  accrue  to  the  poor  and  the  very  poor.  About  32% of  road  users  within  the \nproject  areas  are  poor  and  6%  are  classified  very  poor.  Project  benefits  will  accrue  to  about \n40,500 poor beneficiaries, of whom roughly 7,000 are very poor. A distribution analysis indicates \nthat the Project will yield a poverty impact ratio of 0.28. Total net benefits accruing to the poor in \nthe  project  areas  are  estimated  to  amount  to  about  $24  million,  of  which  the  very  poor  will \nreceive about $4 million. Improved road infrastructure will provide rural communities with better \naccess  to  social  service  institutions,  including  hospitals,  clinics,  and  schools.  This  will  help  to \naddress the non-income-related causes of poverty.  \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n9\n\nD. \n\nIndigenous People \n\n36. \nAn  initial  social  assessment  was  carried  out  during  project  processing,  covering  all \npotential subprojects. A detailed socioeconomic evaluation of 15 communities10 was conducted \nand  more  than  six  consultation  meetings  were  held  in  these  communities.  Extensive  research \non the remaining project area was also conducted. The assessment concluded that there are no \nindigenous people living in the project area.  \n \nE. \n\nInternally Displaced Persons and Refugees \n\n37. \nA  total  of  nearly  19,000  internally  displaced  persons  and  refugees  (IDPRs)  live  in  the \nproject area, which constitute about 15% of the total community population. Of 19,000 IDPRs, \nabout 18,000 are refugees, while the remainders are internally displaced persons. The Project \nwill  provide  the  IDPRs  with  better  access  to  markets,  job  opportunities,  and  basic  social \nservices. The IDPRs do not live near the road alignments, so there will be no negative impact \non the IDPRs during construction. Surveys carried out during project preparation concluded that \nnegative  impacts  on  IDPRs  will  be  limited.  As  the  Project  is  funded  by  a  sector  loan,  an \ninternally  displaced  persons  and  refugees\u2019  development  framework  has  been  prepared  under \nthe original loan. The consulting services for subproject preparation and project supervision will \nreview  potential  negative  impacts  on  IDPRs,  and  prepare  specific  actions  and  development \nplans, if necessary. \n \nF. \n\nLand Acquisition and Resettlement \n\n38. \nRehabilitation work under the Project follows the existing carriageway widths, which are \nabout half of the right-of-way widths. No resettlement will be required even though the lengths of \nsome subprojects slightly decreased or increased when the detailed designs were finalized for \nthe bid documents for packages 1 and 2. It was concluded during the detailed design that there \nis  no  encroachment  on  the  subprojects.  Since  this  is  a  sector  loan,  a  resettlement  framework \nwas prepared at appraisal of the original loan. The resettlement framework is in Supplementary \nAppendix A. \n \nG. \n\nEnvironmental Impacts  \n\n39. \nThe  Project  is  category  B  and  is  expected  to  have  insignificant  environmental  impacts \nduring  both  construction  and  operation  stages,  even  if  the  length  of  some  subprojects  has \nslightly  changed  (para.  38).  All  the  subprojects  are  more  than  1  km  from  protected  areas \n(national  parks  or  state  reserves).  No  ecological  or  biodiversity  impacts  are  expected. \nThe  environmental  assessment  and  review  procedures  included  in  an  initial  environmental \nexamination (IEE) covered the screening and selection process and criteria for packages 1 and \n2,  following  ADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy  (2002)  and  Environmental  Assessment  Guidelines \n(2003). The environmental management plan (EMP) prepared under the IEE included mitigation \nmeasures,  monitoring  programs,  and  capacity-building  programs.  Environmental  impact  was \nassessed  during  subproject  preparation,  and  will  be  monitored  and  evaluated  during  project \nimplementation.  EMPs  and  IEEs  have  been  prepared  for  the  subprojects  (packages  1  and  2) \nbased on the detailed designs and were included in the contract documents. This process will \nbe supported and monitored by the consulting firm for subproject preparation and construction \nsupervision.  \n \n\n                                                 \n10 The communities have a total population of about 25,820 persons (about 20% of the total people living within the \nproject areas) along four subprojects in Gegharkunik (road link no. 2), Ararat (road link no. 17), and Kotayk (road \nlink nos. 14 and 27). \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\nH. \n\nRisks \n\n40. \nThe  major  risks  identified  in  the  original  loan  (project  implementation  delays  and  low \nquality  of  works)  still  apply  to  the  proposed  supplementary  loan.  The  ongoing  packages  are \nexperiencing implementation delays because of  the Project\u2019s cost overruns and the prolonged \napproval process for contracts by the Government. The proposed supplementary loan will help \nexpedite the implementation of the Project. However, if there are any further increase in prices \nof commodities, the Government might reduce some subprojects through a change in scope, \nor will finance the additional cost from its own resources.  \n \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n41. \nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  assured  its  continued \ncompliance with the covenants set forth in the Loan Agreement (Special Operations) dated 15 \nNovember 2007. \n \n\nVI. \n\nRECOMMENDATIONS \n\n42. \nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  supplementary  loan  would  comply  with  the  Articles  of \nAgreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve the \nsupplementary  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to  Special  Drawing  Rights  11,201,000  to \nArmenia  for  the  Rural  Sector  Road  Project  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources,  with  an \ninterest  charge  at  the  rate  of  1.0%  per  annum  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5%  per  annum \nthereafter;  a  term  of  31  years,  including  a  grace  period  of  7  years;  and  such  other  terms  and \nconditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft Loan Agreement \npresented to the Board; and \n \n43. \nI recommend that the Board approve the proposal set forth in para. 21 of this report that \nbitumen  procured  from  non-member  countries  of  ADB  for  civil  works  under  the  Rural  Road \nSector  Project  be  eligible  for  financing  from  the  proposed  supplementary  loan.  If  the  requisite \naffirmative  votes  of  directors  representing  not  less  than  two  thirds  of  the  total  voting  power  of \nADB  member  countries,  pursuant  to  Article  14  (ix)  of  the  Agreement  Establishing  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank, is not obtained for this recommendation and the Board only  approves the \nrecommendation in para. 42, then only bitumen for civil works procured from member countries \nof ADB will be eligible for financing under the Rural Road Sector Project. \n \n\n \n \nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n\n \n \n15 October 2008\n\n \n\n\fAppendix 1 \n\n11\n\nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \n\n \nPerformance Targets and/or \nIndicators \n\nData Sources and/or \nReporting \nMechanisms \n\n \nAssumptions \nand Risks \n\n \n\n \nReduced poverty levels in the \nproject area from 29.8% in 2007 to \n13.0% in 2017, using a national \npoverty line based on annual \nhousehold surveys prepared by the \nNational Statistics Services \n \n \nLevel of motorized traffic on \nimproved roads increased by \naverage of 40% from 2007 within \n2 years of project completion \n \nValue of goods carried on improved \nroads increased by an average of \n20% from 2007 within 2 years of \nproject completion \n \n \nReduction in travel time by more \nthan 40% on average for the whole \nProject after project completion \nfrom the appraisal time in 2006 \n \n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \nComplete rehabilitation of rural \nroads totaling about 220 kilometers \n(km)  \n \nAverage surface roughness for the \nsubprojects reduced from an \ninternational roughness index of \n10.9 m/km in 2007 to no more than \n4.0 m/km after project completion \n \nReduction in vehicle operating \ncosts by more than 40% on \naverage for the whole Project after \nproject completion \n\n \nNational statistics \n \nAsian Development \nBank (ADB) project \nperformance audit \nreport  \n\n \nDirect measures of \ntraffic volume, road \nroughness, and travel \ntime through periodic \nsurveys conducted by \nthe Armenian Roads \nDirectorate  \n \nPeriodic household \nsurveys in the project \narea \n \nProject progress \nreports \n \nADB review missions \n \nADB project \ncompletion report \n\n \n \nConsultant\u2019s contract \nmilestones \n \n \nProject progress \nreports \n \nADB review missions \n \nADB project \ncompletion report \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nAssumption \nThe Government continues to \naccord high priority to the \nPoverty Reduction Strategy \nPaper and the Lifeline Road \nNetwork Program \n\nAssumptions \n\u2022  Continued political stability \nand economic growth in \nArmenia and the region \n\u2022  Effective implementation of \nthe Poverty Reduction and \nStrategy Paper \n\n\u2022  Adequate government \n\nfunding for the road sector \n\n\u2022  Sufficient capacity of \n\ndomestic road construction \nand maintenance \ncompanies \n\n \n\n \n\nRisk \nInadequate maintenance of \nthe project road after \ncompletion because of \ninsufficient funding  \n\nAssumptions \n \n\n\u2022  Continued high priority \n\ngiven by the Government to \nthe Project \n\n\u2022  The Government\u2019s \n\ncontinued cooperation \nduring project \nimplementation \n\n\u2022  Availability of key statistics \nand information relating to \nthe Project \n\n\u2022  High-quality consulting \nservices for subproject \npreparation and \nconstruction supervision  \n\nRisks \n\u2022  Project implementation \n\ndelay \n\n\u2022  Poor quality of civil works \n\u2022  Price increases of oil  and \nother road construction \nmaterials  \n\n \n\n \nDesign \nSummary \n\nImpact \nPoverty \nreduction in the \nproject area \n \n\nOutcome \nImproved \naccess of rural \npopulations in \nthe project area \nto jobs, markets, \nand social \nservices, and \nthe major trunk \nroad networks \nthrough \nreduction in \nroad transport \ncosts \n \n\nOutputs \n \nImprovement to \nhigh-priority \nroads \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f12 \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n \n\nActivities with Milestones \n1.

The  expected  outputs  of  the  investment  components \ncontinue  to  be:  (i)  improvements  to  about  220  kilometers  (km)  of  high-priority  roads,  (ii)  an \nimprovement  to  the  transport  management  capability  of  the  Ministry  of  Transport  and \nCommunications (MOTC), and (iii) an improvement to the road asset management capability of \nthe Armenian Roads Directorate. \n \n2. \nrural road section (subproject). \n \nB. \n\nAn economic analysis was undertaken for the physical investment component for each \n\nMethodology \n\nThe  economic  internal  rate  of  return  (EIRR)  and  the  net  present  value  (NPV)  were \n3. \ncalculated by comparing the with- and without-project scenarios for 2008\u20132029, including a 3-\nyear construction period. The highway development and management model 4 was used as the \nbasis  for  the  analysis.  Seasonal  adjustments  were  made  to  the  traffic  counts,  based  on  an \nassessment  of  the  local  situations.  No  salvage  value  was  considered  at  the  end  of  each \nsubproject\u2019s  economic  life.  All  costs  and  benefits  were  valued  in  constant  2008  prices \nexpressed in US dollars. \n \nThe economic analysis used the world price numeraire, excluding all taxes and duties. \n4. \nThe  economic  costs  of  nontraded  goods  were  converted  to  the  world  price  level  using  a \nstandard conversion factor of 0.80.  \n \nThe economic  costs are derived from the actual bidding price received by the project \n5. \nmanagement  unit  for  package  1  and  the  projected  package  2  bid  prices,  excluding  taxes  and \nduties,  interest  and  other  charges  during  construction.  The  construction  period  was  based  on \nthe implementation schedule. For the without-project case, a continued worsening of the surface \ncondition is assumed to reach the standard maximum international roughness index (IRI) values \nby  pavement  type  before  receiving  pavement  overlay  and/or  re-graveling  treatment.  The \nmaintenance cost for each road section was assumed at regular intervals. \n \nThe original economic  benefits in the Rural Road Sector Project were assumed to be \n6. \nvalid.  With  the  Project,  access  to  rural  areas  will  be  improved,  providing  savings  in  road  user \ntime and vehicle operating costs. Traffic counts in December 2006 were assumed to be valid. \nCombined  generated  and  induced  traffic  were  assumed  conservatively  to  be  20%  of  normal \ntraffic.  Generated  and  induced  benefits  are  typically  evaluated  at  50%  of  normal  traffic \nbenefits\u2014equivalent to a normal traffic increase of 10%. The parameter values for the highway \ndevelopment and management model 4 analysis are in Table A6.1. \n\n                                                 \n1  ADB.  2007.

The  results  of  the  economic  analysis  presented  in  Tables  A6.2  and  A6.3 \nshow that the estimated EIRRs for the subprojects range from 4% to 79% and the EIRR for the \nProject  as  a  whole  is  estimated  at  34%.  These  results  indicate  that  the  Project  can  be \nconsidered  robust,  as  they  are  greater  than  the  economic  opportunity  cost  of  capital  of  12%. \nThese  values  are  conservative  as  the  economic  evaluation  has  only  considered  quantifiable \nincremental benefits, as in the original Project.  \n \n\n \n\n\f", "author_pages": [" \n", "CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 1 October 2008) \n", "Currency Unit\n", "AMD1.00\n$1.00\n", "\u2013 \n \n= \n= \n", "dram (AMD) \n \n$0.0030 \nAMD304.51 \n", "ABBREVIATIONS \n", "ADB \nARD \nASIF \nEA \nEARF \nEIRR \nEMP \nGDP \nIA \nICB \nIDPR \nIEE \nIRI \nLRNP \nMOTC \nNCB \nNPV \nPAM \nPGC \nPMU \nSIEE \nTA \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "Asian Development Bank \nArmenian Roads Directorate Non-Commercial State Organization \nArmenia Social Investment Fund \nexecuting agency \nenvironmental assessment and review framework \neconomic internal rate of return \nenvironmental management plan  \ngross domestic product \nimplementing agency \ninternational competitive bidding  \ninternally displaced persons and refugees \ninitial environmental examination  \ninternational roughness index \nLifeline Road Network Program \nMinistry of Transport and Communications \nnational competitive bidding \nnet present value  \nproject administration memorandum \nproject governing council  \nproject management unit \nsummary initial environmental examination  \ntechnical assistance \n", " \nNOTES \n", "(i) \n", "The  fiscal  year  (FY)  of  the  Government  of  Armenia  and  its  agencies  ends  on \n31 December.  \n", "(ii) \n", "In this report, \"$\" refers to US dollars. \n", "X.
