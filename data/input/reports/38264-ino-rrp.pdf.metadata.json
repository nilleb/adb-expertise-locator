It  involves  (i)  a  loan  of  $350  million \nequivalent for subprogram 1, and (ii) a technical assistance (TA) \ngrant of $1.5 million. \n \nTargeting classification: General intervention \nSector: Law, economic management, and public policy \nSubsector: Public finance and expenditure management \nThemes:  Governance,  inclusive  social  development,  capacity \ndevelopment \nSubthemes:  Public \norganizational development \n \nCategory C \n\ndevelopment, \n\ngovernance, \n\nhuman \n\n \nSince  1999,  the  Government  of  Indonesia  has introduced major \ndecentralization reforms that have devolved significant functional \nresponsibilities  and  funding  from  the  central  Government  to  the \nregional (provincial, district, and city) governments. The reforms \npursued,  which  in  extent  and  speed  have  had  few  precedents \nelsewhere in the world, have been referred to as the \u201cbig bang\u201d \napproach to decentralization. After the early frantic years of rapid \npolicy and regulatory design and implementation, a more settled \npolicy and legal framework has gradually emerged. More recent \nefforts  have  increasingly  gone  into  fine-tuning  the  basic  policy \napproaches,  adding  more  depth  to  the  framework  of  laws  (with \nlower-level regulations and instruments), and addressing the vital \nissue  of  strengthening  the  Government\u2019s  human  and  systems \ncapacity. The new policy and legal approaches urgently need to \nbe  managed  to  achieve  the  improvements  that  citizens  expect, \nsuch as better social and physical services, and opportunities to \nbenefit from a much more robust economy. \n \nWhile  decentralization  has  administrative,  political,  and  other \ndimensions,  LGFGR  2  focuses  mainly  on  the  fiscal  dimension, \nwhere  implementation  is  critical  and  also  most  challenging. \nLGFGR  2  will  support  the  Government\u2019s  ongoing  efforts  to \nimprove  regional  autonomy  and  financing  (by  strengthening  the \nregional \nintergovernmental \nrevenue  systems), \norganizational  systems,  and \ngovernance  and  service  delivery \n(by  providing  adequate \nfinancing  and  performance  measurement),  and  capacity \ndevelopment  (by  improving  public  financial  management  and \nhuman capacity).  \n \n\npolicy \nregional \n\nframework, \n\nfinancing \n\n\fii \n\n \n\n \nImpact and Outcome \n\n \nFinancing Plan \n\n \nPeriod and Tranching \n\nin  six \n\nthe  management  and  coordination  of \n\ntarget  areas:  (i) \nLGFGR  2  will  broaden  reforms \nstrengthening \nfiscal \ndecentralization;  (ii)  clarifying  regional  administration  to  improve \nservices  and  accountability;  (iii)  making  the  release  of  fiscal \ntransfers  and  shared  revenues  more  equal,  predictable,  and \ntransparent; (iv) reducing regional dependency on fiscal transfers \nby developing more buoyant revenue sources; (v) bolstering the \nmanagement of regional reserves and debts; and (vi) developing \nhuman  and  systems  capacity  and  strengthening  public  financial \nmanagement and accountability.  \n \nThe  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  supports \nIndonesia \naccording to the country strategy and program 2006\u20132009 of (i) \npro-poor,  sustainable  economic  growth;  and \n(ii)  social \ndevelopment.  Governance \nimprovements  and  anticorruption \nefforts  are  key  themes.  Decentralization  and  local  government \nfinance  and  governance  are  key  issues  in  this  regard,  and  are \namong  the  five  key  operational  areas  of  engagement:  (i) \ninfrastructure, (ii) financial sector deepening, (iii) decentralization, \n(iv) achievement of Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), and \nresource  management.  The \n(v)  environment  and  natural \nproposed  program  cluster  will  improve  decentralization  and \naccelerate  MDG  achievement  by  strengthening \nregional \ngovernment  capacity  and  contributing  to  a  more  transparent, \neffective,  and  efficient  policy  and  legal  environment  for  fiscal \ndecentralization,  financial  management,  and  service  delivery.  A \njoint  team  from  the  Government  and  ADB  has  been  working  on \nthe reform program since early 2007. \n \nThe  proposed  LGFGR  2  program  cluster  will  support  the \nGovernment in its efforts to make regional government spending \nand service delivery more efficient, effective, and equitable. It will \nregional \nstrengthen \ngovernments  and  provide  a  more  transparent,  effective,  and \nefficient  policy  and  legal  environment  for  fiscal  decentralization, \nfinancial management, and service delivery.  \n\nthe  organizational  capacity  of \n\nthe \n\n \nA  loan  of  $350  million  equivalent  from  the  ordinary  capital \nresources of ADB will be provided for subprogram 1 of LGFGR 2 \nunder the London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)\u2013based lending \nfacility. The loan will have a term of 15 years, including a grace \nperiod of 3 years, an interest rate to be determined according to \nthe LIBOR-based lending facility, a yearly commitment charge of \n0.15%,  and  other  terms  and  conditions  set  forth  in  the  draft \nprogram  loan  agreement.  ADB\u2019s  Board  of  Directors  has  waived \nthe front-end fee of 1.00% for loans approved from 1 July  2007 \nthrough 30 June 2009. \n \nThe  program  cluster  period  is  from  January  2006  to  December \n2011, with a single-tranche loan of $350 million equivalent to be \n\n\f \nCounterpart Funds \n\n \nExecuting Agency \n\n \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\n \nProcurement and \nDisbursement \n\nProgram Benefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\n \n\niii\n\nformed \n\nto  coordinate \n\nit)  has  been \n\ndisbursed  under  subprogram  1  in  2008  when  the  Government \nshall  have  met  the  conditions  for  effectiveness.  Subprogram  2 \nwill be submitted for Board consideration about 36 months after \nthe  effectiveness  of  subprogram  1,  subject  to  the  adequate \nprogress of reforms and the Government\u2019s readiness to continue \nwith its reform agenda. \n \nThe  Government  will  use  the  counterpart  funds  from  the  loan \nproceeds  to  meet  program  expenditures  and  the  associated \ncosts of local reforms. \n \nDirectorate General of Fiscal Balance of the Ministry of Finance \n(MOF) \n \nThe  implementing  agencies  will  be  directorates  of  (i)  MOF,  (ii) \nthe  Ministry  of  Home  Affairs  (MOHA),  and  (iii)  the  National \n(BAPPENAS).  An  LGFGR \nDevelopment  Planning  Agency \nsteering  committee  (with  an  implementation  committee  and  a \nsecretariat  under \nthe \nimplementation  of  the  LGFGR  program  reform  actions.  The \nsteering  committee  is  chaired  by  the  director  general  of  fiscal \nbalance  of  MOF  and  has  MOHA  and  BAPPENAS  officials  as \nmembers.  Selected  representatives  from  regional  governments \nwill  attend  meetings  of \nimplementation \ncommittees.  The  steering  committee  meets  at  least  semi \nannually to monitor progress and oversee the implementation of \nthe  program,  and  to  guide  and  direct  the  executing  and \nimplementing agencies.  \n \nThe  loan  of  $350  million  for  LGFGR  2  subprogram  1  will  be \nreleased  in  a  single  tranche  when  it  takes  effect.  The  loan \nproceeds  will  finance  the  full  foreign  exchange  costs  (excluding \nlocal  duties  and  taxes)  of  items  produced  and  procured  in  ADB \nmember  countries.  Ineligible  items  and  imports  financed  from \nother bilateral and multilateral sources will not be covered by the \nloan.  The  loan  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  to  the  Borrower \naccording  to  ADB\u2019s  Simplification  of  Disbursement  Procedures \nand  Related  Requirements  for  Program  Loans.  Subprogram  1 \nwill provide for retroactive financing for expenditures incurred by \nthe Government 180 days before the loan takes effect. \n \nLGFGR  2  will  have  significant  benefits  and  positive  effects  on \nregional  service  delivery,  financing,  and  capacity  development. \nThe key expected benefits are as follows: \n\nthe  steering  and \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nStrengthened  management  and  coordination  of  fiscal \ndecentralization by the central Government, and improved \nleadership,  supervision,  and  coordination  of  the  capacity \ndevelopment of regional governments.  \nClearer  assignment  of  expenditures  between  levels  of \ngovernment  and  improved  criteria  for  establishing  new \n\n \n\n\fiv \n\n \n\n \n\n \nRisks and Assumptions  While  some  risks  are  external  and  political,  the  program  design \nand TA will mitigate these and other risks by providing a strong \nbroad-based  governance  framework  with  transparency  and \naccountability  elements \nthe  central  and  regional \ngovernments. The potential risks to LGFGR 2 and the underlying \nassumptions are as follows: \n \n(i) \n\nin  both \n\ntechnical  and  policy  environment \n\nregional governments, leading to more efficient allocation \nof  expenditures  and  better  vertical  balance  in  financing \nbetween levels of government. \nImproved \nfor \nintergovernmental  fiscal  transfers,  revenue  sharing,  and \nlocal  own-source  revenues,  leading  to  more  transparent \nand equitable outcomes across regions (better horizontal \nbalance),  and  less  dependence  on  central  government \ntransfers. \nStrengthened  management  of  regional  reserves  and \ndebts,  contributing \nlong-term \ninvestment financing for infrastructure. \nEnhanced  organizational,  systems,  and  human  resource \ncapacity  of regional  governments,  particularly  to  manage \nand  report  finances  and  to  measure  performance,  thus \nimproving public service delivery and accountability.     \nStrengthened \nperformance  monitoring  and  evaluation \naccountability. \n\ncoordinated \nimprove \nto \n\nto  better  access \n\ngovernance \n\nthrough \n\nto \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nRegional  government  leadership  and  capacity.    The \nregional  governments  might  not  have  the  necessary \nleadership,  commitment,  and  capacity  to  innovate  and \nlearn and to translate financial resource and management \nsystems  improvements  into  better  services  and  reduced \npoverty. This risk will be mitigated by improvements in (a) \nbottom-up  accountability,  with  better  public \nfinancial \nmanagement  and  greater  transparency  in  reporting;  (b) \nvertical  organizational \nstructures  and  hierarchical \nresponsibilities; (c) accountability of regional governments \nto oversight and coordination agencies; (d) accountability \nthrough  the  electoral  process;  and  (e)  the  regional  civil \nservice. \nPolitical  change.  National  and  regional  government \nelections are due from 2009. The new national or regional \ngovernments may not endorse the policy framework in the \nNational Action Plan for Fiscal Decentralization (NAPFD) \nthe  political  and  bureaucratic \nand  LGFGR  2.  But \nmomentum  of  reforms  has  been  significant  and  growing \nwith  the  rise  of  reform  champions,  and  is  unlikely  to  be \ncompletely  reversed  by  a  new  administration.  Some \nallowance  must,  however,  be  made  for  new  policy \napproaches at the margins.  \n\n(ii) \n\n \n\n\f \n\nv\n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nin  coordination \nNational  coordination.  Problems \nbetween  key  national  agencies  could  still  delay  program \nimplementation  despite  the  improvements  made  so  far. \nThis risk has been mitigated by the emergence of the new \nDirectorate  General  of  Fiscal  Balance  as  the  leader  in \nfiscal  aspects  of  decentralization  and  the  longer-term \ncapacity-building efforts of the directorate general and the \npresident\u2019s Regional Autonomy Advisory Council (DPOD). \nMoreover,  all  key  stakeholders  will  take  part  in  revising \nthe NAPFD in 2009, enhancing national approaches. \nFlexibility  of \nregional  organizational  structures. \nOrganizations  and  their  staff  may  resist  more  flexible \norganizational arrangements and staffing. This resistance \nis  likely  to  be  offset  by  orderly  and  socially  acceptable \nrightsizing, combined with growing community support for \nspending  less  resources  on  unproductive  administration \nand more on productive activities. \nHorizontal  equity  between  regions.  Political  and  other \npressures  could  delay  the  more  equitable  distribution  of \ntransfers  and  shared  revenues,  and  benefit  relatively \nregions.  But \nbetter-off,  natural \nequalization  has  gained  important  momentum  with  the \nremoval  of  the  \u201chold  harmless\u201d  provisions  of  the  general \nequalization  grant  in  2008,  and  improved  analysis  and \ntransparency  in  intergovernmental  financial  flows  will \nincrease accountability and create a larger constituency in \nfavor of further equalization. \n\nresource\u2013endowed \n\n \nFor  subprogram  2,  the  Government  has  asked  ADB  for  a  $1.5 \nmillion  policy  and  advisory  technical  assistance  (TA)  to  be \nattached  to  this  program.  The  TA  will  support  the  ongoing \ndevelopment  of  the  reform  agenda  in  regional  government \nfinancing  and  governance  (contained  in  the  NAPFD  and  the \npolicy  matrix  for  subprogram  2)  and  its  implementation,  and \nprovide  timely  policy  advice  to  the  Government  as  needed. \nMedium-term support for the reform agenda is expected to come \nfrom another TA. \n \nThe attached TA will center on the Directorate General of Fiscal \nBalance and will include the following components: (i) extending \nthe  NAPFD  to  2010\u20132014,  (ii)  building  a  database  and  financial \nmodeling  capacity  in  the  directorate  general  to  support  the \nongoing review of intergovernmental transfers, (iii) designing and \nimplementing \nfor \nof \na \n(iv) \nintergovernmental \ndeveloping and disseminating new regulations and guidelines for \nthe  specific  allocation \n(v)  developing  and \nimplementing a targeted package of incentives and sanctions for \nselected  intergovernmental  transfers,  (vi)  supporting  the  early \nstages  of  devolution  of  the  property  tax,  and  (vii)  human  and \nsystems  capacity  building  in  decentralized  locations.  About  24 \n\nsystem \ntransfers  and \n\nestimates \nrevenues, \n\nforward \nshared \n\n(DAK), \n\nfund \n\n \n\n \nTechnical Assistance \n\n\fvi \n\n \n\n \n \n\nperson-months of international and 80 person-months of national \nconsulting services will be required for the TA. All the consultants \nwill be recruited and hired according to ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the \nUse of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time).  \n \nThe  second  TA  of  $1  million  for  subprogram  2  policy  actions  is \nexpected  to  be  processed  separately  in  2009.  Subject  to  more \ndetailed  consultations  with  the  Government,  the  TA  will  (i) \nexplore  further  policy  options  for  the  future  status  of  DPOD;  (ii) \nstudy more efficient uses of regional government labor resources \nby  determining  the  wage  bill  formula  and  giving  regional \ngovernments discretion in the use of general allocation fund; (iii) \nfurther support the amendment of sector laws and regulations to \nmake  them  consistent  with  the  new  expenditure  assignments \nand  other  decentralization  laws;  (iv)  support  a  creditworthy \nregional  government  in  planning  regional  bond  issues  through \ntraining,  due  diligence  studies,  and  document  preparation;  (v) \npilot-test  and  roll  out  the  regional  government  performance \nmeasurement system and train regional government staff to use \nthe system; (vi) support the restructuring of regional government \nbudgets  through  the  closure  or  privatization  of  low-priority  and \nnonperforming  activities  and  assets, \nregional \nenterprises,  and  other  means;  and  (vii)  inventory  the  financial \nmanagement  information  systems  in  171  regional  governments \nand review options for their further expansion. \n\nincluding \n\n\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n1. \nI  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  report  and  recommendation  on:  (i)  a  proposed \nprogram  cluster  for  the  Government  of  Indonesia\u2019s  Second  Local  Government  Finance  and \nGovernance Reform Program (LGFGR 2), and (ii) a proposed loan for subprogram 1 of LGFGR \n2.  Subprogram  1  was  prepared  by  a  joint  team  from  the  Government  and  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB). This report also describes proposed technical assistance (TA) for the \ncapacity  development  of  fiscal  decentralization  agencies.  If  the  Board  approves  the  proposed \nloan, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, will approve the TA (para 87). \nThe program design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n\nII. \n\nTHE MACROECONOMIC CONTEXT  \n\n2. \nIndonesia\u2019s economic performance strengthened further in 2007, when economic growth \naccelerated  to  a  10-year  high  of  6.3%  despite  a  slowing  global  economy.  Unlike  previously, \neconomic  growth  appeared  to  be  more  employment-friendly:  unemployment  declined  from \n10.3% in 2006 to 9.1% in 2007. The growth was propelled by a strong pickup in investment due \nto  the  progress  of  reforms  and  improvement  in  business  perception.  High  growth  was  also \nsupported by stronger export performance, attributed to high prices of commodities, particularly \ncoal  and  palm  oil.  The  government  budget  deficit  at  the  end  of  2007  was  1.3%  of  gross \ndomestic  product  (GDP),  and  the  debt-to-GDP  ratio,  in  a  continued  rapid  decline, was  around \n35%, down from 39% in 2006.  \n \n3. \nIn  2007,  inflation  ended  at  6.6%,  close  to  the  upper  end  of  the  Bank  Indonesia  target. \nHowever,  since  the  start  of  2008,  inflation  has  been  on  the  rise,  reaching  11.85%  in  August \n2008.  Inflationary  pressure  has  been  driven  primarily  by  external  factors  related  to  escalating \ninternational prices of food and commodities. Until late May 2008, inflation was insulated from \nsurging  international  prices  by  the  domestic  fuel  subsidy.  The  29%  increase  in  fuel  prices \nannounced recently by the Government may exert further inflationary pressure. In response to \nthe rising inflation, Bank Indonesia progressively increased its rate by 150 basis points to 9.50% \nin  October  2008  and  has  declared  its  intent  to  adjust  future  rates  as  appropriate  to  manage \ninflation expectations. Table 1 presents the key macroeconomic indicators for Indonesia. \n \n4. \nThe  rising  international  fuel  prices  have  generated  heavy  pressure  on  the  central \ngovernment  budget.  Under  the  current  regime  of  administered  pricing,  the  prices  of  over  two \nthirds of fuel sold\u2014gasoline, transportation diesel, and kerosene\u2014have been fixed since 2005. \nAs  a  result,  government  spending  on  energy  subsidies  has  grown  rapidly  and  is  estimated  to \nhave  gone  up  to  4.2%  of  GDP  in  2008,  versus  the  budgeted  1.8%.  While  the  continued \nescalation  in  international  fuel  prices  helps  the  central  Government  on  the  revenue  side,  its \noverall  impact  on  the  budget  is  negative.  Measures  have  been  proposed  to  cut  line-ministry \nsubsidies to electricity and to ration kerosene so that it goes only to the poor. These measures \nand the fuel price increase are expected to reduce the budget deficit from the budgeted 1.7% of \nGDP to about 1.3% of GDP. As international oil prices are expected to stay volatile and difficult \nto  predict,  the  Government  is  committed  to  the  longer-term  goal  of  pricing  energy  at  market \nrates to promote efficiency and safeguard its fiscal position. \n \nIf  high  commodity  prices  and  the  risk  of  a  global  economic  slowdown  persist,  the \n5. \neconomic  outlook  will  be  one  of  considerable  challenge.  However,  Indonesia  is  expected  to \nweather  the  global  slowdown  reasonably  well  in  the  short  term  with  growth  slowing  slightly  to \n\n\f6.2%  in  2008.  Going  forward  in  2009,  growth  is  projected  to  weaken  due  to  protracted  global \nfinancial  crisis.  Increased  exchange  rate  flexibility,  adequate  reserves,  improved  export \ndiversity, declining external debt, and the recent preemptive actions taken by the Government \nshould cushion the negative effects of external shocks. Although export growth is projected to \nslow  somewhat  in  2008,  domestic  demand,  especially  investment,  should  remain  robust\u2014\nrealized investment in the first half of 2008 was up by 81%. Consumption could weaken slightly \nin response to higher inflation, but is expected to remain strong. With continued strong growth, \nthe  debt-to-GDP  ratio  is  projected  to  decline  further  to  33%  by  the  end  of  2008.  On  the \ndownside, without further adjustments in fuel prices, higher international fuel prices will continue \nto  pose  significant  risk  to  the  central  government  budget.  On  the  upside,  further  progress  in \nimplementing  structural  reforms  and  removing  bottlenecks  to  infrastructure  investment  would \nperk  up  growth.  Consistent  implementation  of  fiscal  decentralization  reforms  would  also  help \nimprove domestic investment.  \n \n\nTable 1: Key Macroeconomic Indicators for Indonesia, 2005\u20132008  \n \n\n2003 \n\n2004 \n\n2005 \n\n2006 \n\n2007 \n\nYear \n\n \nItem \nA.

Five  priority  areas  are  identified  in  the \nplan: (i) job creation and poverty reduction, (ii) macroeconomic stability with fiscal sustainability \nand financial sector reforms, (iii) accelerated investments and exports with the help of a healthy \nbusiness climate, (iv) improved access to better-quality education and health services, and (v) \ninfrastructure development with greater participation from the private sector. For these reforms \nto bear fruit, the Government must increase its development spending to spur economic growth, \nreduce  poverty,  and  achieve  the  MDGs  more  quickly.  Recognizing  the  critical  role  of  regional \ngovernments in sustained growth and poverty reduction, the Government, in 2005, launched a \ncomprehensive  National  Action  Plan  for  Fiscal  Decentralization  (NAPFD)  setting  out  medium-\nterm decentralization reforms. \n \nADB\u2019s  country  strategy  and  program  (CSP)  for  2006\u20132009 1 is  fully  aligned  with  the \n7. \nRPJM  aiming  at  higher  yet  sustainable  and  pro-poor  growth  and  social  development  for  the \ncountry, with particular emphasis on good governance and anticorruption measures. There are \nfive core areas of engagement: (i) infrastructure and infrastructure services, (ii) financial sector \ndeepening,  (iii)  decentralization,  (iv)  MDG  achievement,  and  (v)  environment  and  natural \nresource  management.  The  CSP  uses  innovative  approaches  including  single-tranche  cluster \nprogram  lending.  For  investment  projects,  multitranche  financing  facilities  in  several  sectors \nprovide  long-term  investment  and  policy  engagement.  Supporting  TA  clusters  align  the \nassistance with emerging demands and allow more flexibility. \n \nFollowing on from the first LGFGR program, LGFGR 2 continues to tackle major policy \n8. \nissues in a medium- to longer-term framework to improve the implementation of decentralization \npolicy  as  envisioned  in  the  RPJM,  the  NAPFD,  and  the  CSP.  It  strengthens  government \ninstitutions  that  directly  support  regional  development  while  deepening  reforms  in  fiscal \nconsolidation, good governance, public financial management, and service delivery down to the \nregional  governments. 2  LGFGR  2  also  complements  the  broader  policy  support  from  the \nDevelopment  Policy  Support  Program  (DPSP).3 ADB  provides  a  comprehensive  package  of \nsupport  for  the  Government\u2019s  overall  objectives  of  poverty  reduction  and  equitable  growth. \nFigure 1 captures the links between the RPJM, the NAPFD, LGFGR 1 and 2, and the CSP. \n\n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2006.

Apart from the experience \ngained directly under LGFGR 1 and diagnostic work on fiscal aspects of decentralization during \nCSP  preparation  in  2006,  the  design  of  LGFGR  2  has  benefited  from  a  significant  amount  of \nsector diagnostic study done between 2006 and 2008 on the fiscal aspects of decentralization. \nThis work involved: (i) a comprehensive stock taking of fiscal decentralization, undertaken jointly \n\n4 \n\n \n\n\fby funding agencies and the Government;4 (ii) a diagnostic review of issues and the preparation \nof  a  medium-term  work  plan  for  the  Decentralization  Support  Facility  (DSF);5 (iii)  an  extensive \ndiagnostic  review  of  priority  reforms  to  be  considered  in  designing  LGFGR  2  and  the  project \npreparatory  TA  for  LGFGR  2; 6 (iv)  a  public  expenditure  review  with  emphasis  on  the  fiscal \naspects of decentralization;7 and (v)  various internal government reviews (some supported by \nADB TA projects) made to assess progress in implementing LGFGR 1 and the NAPFD. \n \n10.   Evolving Administrative and Legal Framework. In the aftermath of the economic and \npolitical upheavals of the late 1990s, the Government introduced major decentralization reforms \nthat have devolved significant authority, functional responsibilities, and funding from the central \nGovernment  to  provincial  and  local  governments.  The  \u201cbig  bang\u201d  reforms  launched  in  2001 \ninvolved  a  massive  delegation  of  responsibility  for  the  provision  of  public  services  and  the \nreassignment  of  two  thirds  of  central  government  civil  servants  and  more  than  16,000  service \ndelivery  facilities  to  the  regional  governments.  Regional  government  expenditures  almost \ndoubled,  making  Indonesia  one  of  the  most-decentralized  countries  in  the  world,  with  its \nregional  governments  managing  more  than  40%  of  total  government  expenditure. 8  Not \nsurprisingly, the transition to such a radically different system of governance has been far from \nsmooth.  Over  the  last  6  years,  there  has  been  continuous  reform  and  fine-tuning.  Observers \nbelieve  that  the  constant  need  for  change  arose  because  Indonesia  did  not  prepare  a  white \npaper setting the overall design and framework for decentralization.9 Without such a road map, \nthere is a tendency to \u201cmake it up as we go along,\u201d leading to pieces of decentralization strategy \nthat may not fit together. In addition, later policy changes may not be consistent with the overall \ngoals  of  fiscal  decentralization.  A  case  in  point  is  the  \u201chold  harmless\u201d  system  that  was  put  in \nplace by the house of representatives (Dewan Perwakilan Rakyat, or DPR) to protect regional \ngovernments  from  a  reduction  in  revenues  once  the  new  formula-based  intergovernmental \ngrants  were  introduced.  The  system  compromised  the  equalization  effects  of  the  grant  and \nperpetuated perverse wage incentives. Although the fiscal architecture is far from complete, the \nGovernment as a matter of policy has turned away from building up the decentralization system \nand toward fine-tuning the system to improve governance and service delivery.  \n \n11. \nDecentralization  reforms  in  Indonesia  formally  began  in  1999  with  the  passage  of  two \nfundamental  laws:  (i)  a  law  on  local  administration  (law  22/1999),  which  spelled  out  the \nfunctional  responsibilities  and  administrative  structures  of  regional  governments  and  defined \ntheir  autonomy;  and  (ii)  a  law  on  financial  balance  between  the  central  Government  and  the \nregions  (law  25/1999),  which  dealt  with  revenue  sources,  including  transfers  and  revenue \nassignments  and  other  aspects  of  fiscal  relations.  Under  these  laws,  decentralization  in \nIndonesia  took  shape  with  several  distinctive  features.  As  far  as  organizational  structure  was \nconcerned,  local  governments  were  not  hierarchically  linked  to  provincial  governments; \nexecutive  and  legislative  bodies  were  elected  at  each  level,  leaving  the  door  open  for  the \ncreation  (proliferation)  of  new  regional  governments.  Regarding  expenditure  assignments,  the \ncentral Government reserved for itself a very short list of national responsibilities (international \n                                                 \n4  Development Support Facility, Asian Development Bank, US Agency for International Development, and Australian \nAgency  for  International  Development.  2006.

Local  governments  deliver  public  services  in  most \nsectors\u2014public works, health, education and culture, communication, industry and trade, capital \nlabor.  Regional  governments  have \ninvestment,  environment, \nconsiderable discretion in managing and delivering services. However, because of widespread \nfailure  to  adapt  sectoral  laws  (on  education,  public  health,  etc.)  to  the  new  decentralization \nprinciples,  line  ministries  and  other  central  government  agencies  continue  to  provide  services \nand undertake expenditures in areas that have been decentralized.  \n \n12. \nLaw  34/2000  grants  taxation  and  revenue  powers  to  regional  governments  but  gives \nthem  little  meaningful  revenue  autonomy.  Although  regional  governments  can  introduce  their \nown  taxes,  such  taxes  have  to  meet  \u201cgood  tax\u201d  criteria  defined  in  the  law.  The  central \nGovernment  has  kept  control  of  the  main  taxes,  and  new  taxes  introduced  by  the  regional \ngovernments tend to be nuisance taxes, distorting domestic trade and economic activity. Under \nthe  law,  new  regional  taxes  are  reviewed  by  the  central  Government,  which  holds  ultimate \npower of revocation. The DPR is considering amending law 34/2000 and including a closed-list \napproach to regional taxes to rein in nuisance taxes. The main source of financing for regional \ngovernments  has  been  transfers,  notably  from  revenue  sharing  but  mostly  from  the  general \nallocation  fund  (Dana  Alokasi  Umum,  or  DAU),  which  was  conceived  fundamentally  as  an \nequalization grant. For many years, however, the larger share of this grant has been distributed \nnot  according  to  the  equalization  formula  but  rather  to  finance  public  sector  employees  and \nother objectives. \n \nThis  original  framework  was  reconstructed  in  2004,  when  parliament  approved  law \n13. \n32/2004 amending law 22/1999 on regional autonomy, and law 33/2004 amending law 25/1999 \non  regional  fiscal  relations.  In  particular,  law  32/2004  reestablished  a  hierarchical  role  for  the \nprovinces vis-\u00e0-vis the districts and cities. Regional planning, budgeting, financial management, \nand oversight have also undergone significant reforms with the passing of new central finance, \ntreasury,  planning,  and  audit  laws  in  2003\u20132005,  followed  by  a  raft  of  new  lower-level \nregulations.10 The  new  legal  requirements  are  being  gradually  introduced  in  the  regions,  and \nmodern budgeting and financial management approaches are being put in place in areas such \nas  budget  unification,  treasury  management,  medium-term  programming  and  performance-\nbased planning and budgeting, and enhanced monitoring, evaluation, and internal and external \naudit  of  performance  outcomes.  Over  time,  the  LGFGR  program  cluster  and  related  projects \nfunded by the Government and development partners seek to significantly enhance institutional, \nsystems,  and  human  resource  capacity  to  achieve  the  desired  outcomes  from  the  new \napproaches to public financial management (PFM) that have been put in place. \n \n14. \nFigure  2  sets  out  the  basic  structure  of  the  regional  government  system,  with  33 \nprovinces,  95  municipalities  (kota),  370  districts  (kabupaten),  and  about  73,458  villages  (desa \nand  kelurahan).  Provinces,  districts,  and  municipalities  all  have  their  own  elected  heads  of \ngovernment  (governor,  bupati,  and  mayor,  respectively)  as  well  as  their  own  elected \nrepresentative  bodies  (Dewan  Perwakilan  Rakyat  Daerah,  or  DPRD).  The  subdistricts \n(kecamatan)  are  administrative  arms  of  the  districts  and  municipalities,  while  the  villages \noperate at the community level with elected heads. The main central government coordinating \nand  supervising  bodies  are:  (i)  the  Ministry  of  Finance  (MOF);  (ii)  the  National  Development \nPlanning  Agency  (Badan  Perencanaan  Pembangunan  Nasional,  or  BAPPENAS);  (iii)  the \n\n                                                 \n10  More than 50 new presidential, government, and ministry regulations and decrees relating to fiscal decentralization \n\nwere passed from 2005 to mid-2008.  \n\n\fMinistry  of  Home  Affairs  (MOHA);  (iv)  the  Supreme  Audit  Authority  (Badan  Pemeriksa \nKeuangan,  or  BPK);  and  (v)  the  president\u2019s  Regional  Autonomy  Advisory  Council  (Dewan \nPertimbangan  Otonomi  Daerah,  or  DPOD).  Established  under  law  32/2004,  the  DPOD  is \nchaired by the minister of home affairs and co-chaired by the minister of finance. At the highest \nlevel,  it  contains  other  ministers  and  regional  government  representatives.  It  has  (i)  working \ngroups, (ii) technical groups, and (iii) a secretariat. The council advises the president on regional \nautonomy policy regarding: (i) the establishment, abolition, or merger of regional governments; \n(ii) the assessment of regional government performance; (iii) the assignment of functions; and \n(iv) fiscal balance matters, including the DAU and shared-revenue allocations. The longer-term \nstrengthening of the DPOD is an important objective of LGFGR 2. \n \n\nFigure 2: Structure of the Regional Government System in Indonesia \n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nProvinces  \n \n(Propinsi) \n(33) \n\nDistricts \n \n(Kabupaten) \n(370) \n\nCentral Government \n \n \n(Pusat) \n\nSubdistricts \n \n \n(Kecamatan) \n(635) \n\nMunicipalities \n(Kota) \n(95) \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       Source: Central Bureau of Statistics (BPS), as of the end of 2007. \n \n   \n15. \nIncreasingly  Decentralized  Service  Delivery.  Regional  governments  have  assumed \nthe key role in the delivery of core services, including education, health, and the development of \nbasic  infrastructure  such  as  waterworks  and  roads.  An  important  issue  is  the  impact  of \ndecentralization on the quantity and quality of those services. While decentralization is relatively \nnew,  a  preliminary  assessment  at  least  can  be  made  at  this  time.  The  performance  of  the \nregional governments can be evaluated from (i) an expenditure perspective (has there been an \nadequate increase in expenditures allocated to decentralized services, i.e., have funds followed \nfunctions?); (ii) an expenditure composition perspective (is there a desirable mix or composition \nof  expenditures?);  or  (iii)  a  service  delivery  perspective  (has  the  quality  of  services \nimproved?).11  \n\nSubdistricts \n(Kecamatan) \n(635) \n\nVillages \n(Kelurahan) \n(4,865) \n\nVillages \n(Desa) \n(68,593) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n                                                 \n11  Unless  stated  otherwise,  fiscal  data  in  this  report  are  drawn  from  the  MOF  regional  financial  information  system \n\n(SIKD), the Central Bureau of Statistics (BPS), and the Supreme Audit Authority (BPK). \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\nExpenditure  Levels.  National  education  expenditures  now  approach  4%  of  GDP,  up \n16. \nfrom 2% in 2001. With close to 17% of total public expenditures going to education, the country \nis  spending  at  good  standard  international  levels,  adjusted  for  income  per  capita.  The  lion\u2019s \nshare  of  growth  in  education  expenditures  has  been  in  the  local  governments,  from  negligible \nlevels in 2000 to more than 2% of GDP recently. But central government expenditures have not \ndecreased  very  significantly  (from  about  1.3%  of  GDP  in  2000  to  0.9%  recently).  Much  local \nexpenditure  is  on  teacher  salaries,  with  a  simple  switch  in  administrative  responsibilities  from \ncentral to local. Total expenditures on public health have increased moderately in recent years \nbut  are  still  less  than  2%  of  GDP,  little  changed  from  2001  and  quite  low  by  international \nstandards.  Regional  government  expenditure  on  public  health  did  increase  sharply  after  2001 \n(11.5%  of  sector  expenditures  in  2000  and  42.9%  in  2006).  But  this  was  largely  offset  by \ndecreases  in  health  expenditures  by  the  central  Government  (from  64.3%  of  sector \nexpenditures in 2000 to 41.2% in 2006), while the provincial governments\u2019 share has declined, \nfrom 24.2% in 2000 to 15.8% in 2006. Public investment declined from 7% of GDP in 1996 to \nless than 3% in 2001 and has only recently recovered to pre-crisis levels of about 7% of GDP. \nIn 2000\u20132006, central government public investment grew from 2.2% of GDP to 2.7% of GDP; \nlocal  investment  over  this  period  grew  more  rapidly,  from  1.3%  to  2.8%,  while  provincial \ninvestment grew from 0.3% to 1.0% of GDP.  \n \n17. \n Functional  Composition  of  Expenditures.  The  current  composition  of  regional \nexpenditures is still less than optimal. While education has become the most important sector in \nregional  budgets,  expenditures  on  public  health  have  not  increased  significantly.  Government \nadministration  expenditures  are  the  second  most  important  in  regional  budgets.  Regional \ngovernments still spend too little on infrastructure, with central government agencies continuing \nto control about 50% of infrastructure spending. Low spending on basic infrastructure services \nhas been complicated by two factors. One, regional governments\u2019 routine expenditures account \nfor 65% of total expenditures and a very high proportion of these go solely to personnel costs. \nTwo, much too little is spent on supplies and equipment. Health clinics, for example, often lack \nbasic medications, clean water, and electricity.  \n \n18. \nlaunching  of \ndecentralization reforms in 2001, service delivery performance has been mixed from the limited \nevidence available, but there are indications that the quality of some services has improved. A \nrecent  World  Bank  survey12 concluded  that  decentralized  services  in  education,  health,  and \ngeneral  administration  have  improved  in  quality  while  police  services,  which  have  not  been \ndecentralized,  have  deteriorated.  But  the  survey  evidence  is  merely  indicative  and  has  to  be \nconfirmed  by  longer-term  trends  in  objective  indicators,  which  are  still  being  developed. \nBesides,  before  2001,  access  to  many  basic  services  was  very  low,  so  any  significant \nimprovement  will  take  time  to  occur.  For  example,  household  access  to  water,  sanitation,  and \nelectricity  is  among  the  lowest  in  the  region,  with  only  18%  of  households  having  access  to \npiped  running  water  and  continued  slow  growth  in  the  number  of  families  with  access  to  safe \nsanitation (18.2 million families in 2003 and  19.4 million in 2005). Although many state-owned \nwater  supply  companies  (Perusahaan  Daerah  Air  Minum,  or  PDAMs)  have  major  financial \nproblems, there was a modest increase in PDAM customers of 11.4% from 2001 to 2005. The \nnumber of households with access to public water taps also grew by 18.2% from 2001 to 2005. \n \n19. \nIn education, Indonesia ranks well internationally at the primary level, with net enrollment \nrates recently (2005) increasing to 95.5%, but is doing less well in junior secondary (65.2%) and \n\nthat  has  passed  since \n\nService  Delivery. \n\ntime \n\nlittle \n\nthe \n\nthe \n\nIn \n\n                                                 \n12  World Bank. 2006. Decentralization, Governance and Public Services in Indonesia. Jakarta: Kaiser, Pattinasarany \n\nand Schulze. \n\n \n\n\fsenior  secondary  school  (41.7%).  Adult  literacy is  showing some  improvement,  from  89.3%  in \n2001  to  90.9%  in  2005,  although  there  are  wide  regional  differences.  Trends  in  the  quality  of \neducation outcomes still need longer-term assessment. Many health indicators remain poor by \ninternational  standards:  among  the  countries  in  the  Association  of  Southeast  Asian  Nations \nregion  Indonesia  has  the  fewest  physicians  for  every  100,000  people.  Ratios  for  nurses  and \nmidwives are somewhat better, but again the distribution varies greatly between regions. On the \nother hand, infant and child mortality rates show good improvement since decentralization. The \ninfant mortality rate fell from 60 per 1,000 live births in 2000 to 28 per 1,000 live births in 2005. \nLife  expectancy  has  also  improved,  particularly  in  poorer  provinces  like  Papua,  where  life \nexpectancy improved from 62.7 years in 1996 to 67.3 years in 2005. \n \n20. \nSocial  Indicators.  More  aggregated  indicators  like  poverty  trends  may  show  how  well \ndecentralized  governance  has  succeeded,  even  if  the  latter  is  only  one  of  many  forces  that \naffect  poverty  trends.  According  to  the  Central  Bureau  of  Statistics  (Badan  Pusat  Statistik,  or \nBPS),  the  poverty  headcount  ratio  has  dropped  sharply  in  relative  terms  since  the  start  of \ndecentralization  (from  23.4%  in  1999  to  16.6%  in  2007).  But  richer  and  poorer  regional \ngovernments  have  not  improved  in  the  same  way:  poverty  in  poorer  and  mainly  agricultural \nregions  is  still  quite  high.  At  the  extremes,  4.6%  of  the  population  in  Jakarta  and  40.8%  in \nPapua were considered poor in 2007.  \n \nTrends  in  Vertical  and  Horizontal  Balance.  These  trends  offer  another  way  of \n21. \nassessing the performance of the decentralization system. As shown in Table 2, total resources \navailable to all regional governments grew strongly from 6.9% of GDP in 2001 (Rp103.4 trillion) \nto 8.4% of GDP in 2006 (Rp279.0 trillion) and are thought to have grown further since. All forms \nof revenue have grown sharply in absolute terms. However, in its share of resources the DAU \ndeclined somewhat in importance from 2001 to 2006 (but was still 52.2% of total resources in \n2006),  while  resource  growth  for  regional  governments  has  come  mainly  from  the  specific \nallocation  fund  (Dana  Alokasi  Khusus,  or  DAK),  at  4.1%  of  total  resources  in  2006  (up  from \n1.1%  in  2001),  and  shared  revenues,  at 23.3%  in  2006  (versus  21.0% in  2001).  Most  regions \narguably  have  enough  resources  to  make  a  difference  in  the  lives  of  their  citizens.  The \nchallenge now is spending the growing resources effectively.  \n \n\nTable 2: Total Resources of Regional Governments \n(Provinces, Kabupaten, and Kota), 2001\u20132006 \n(Rp billion and as % of GDP)  \n\n \n\n2001 \nActual \n\n2002 \nActual \n\n2003 \nActual \n\n2004 \nActual \n\n2005 \nActual \n\n2006 \nActual \n\n \n\n \n  69,554.0 \n    2,648.9 \n  24,309.1 \n  22,181.7 \n    5,232.9 \n\n \n  78,414.8 \n    3,363.4 \n  30,290.0 \n  26,059.4 \n  10,605.7 \n\nItem \n \n \nTotal Regional Resources \n  89,353.3  145,685.4 \n  60,742.0 \n     DAU (general allocation fund) \n  11,569.8 \n    4,252.1 \n  1,123.0 \n     DAK (specific allocation fund) \n  65,107.0 \n  49,829.0 \n  21,688.8 \n     Shared taxes and resources \n  40,739.8 \n  37,964.2 \n  15,471.7 \n     PAD (local own-source revenues) \n    4,420.6 \n  15,872.8 \n  15,378.7 \n     Other revenues \n103,446.2  123,926.6  148,733.5  165,067.9  196,777.2  278,974.8 \n     Total Regional Resources \n           8.4 \n          6.9               6.8 \n     As % of gross domestic product \n \n \n% Share of Total Regional Resources \n         52.2 \n         56.1 \n     DAU (general allocation fund) \n           4.1 \n           2.1 \n     DAK (specific allocation fund) \n         23.3 \n         19.6 \n     Shared taxes and resources \n         14.6 \n         17.9 \n     PAD (local own-source revenues) \n           5.7 \n           4.2 \n     Other revenues \n     Total Regional Resources \n       100.0 \n       100.0 \nSources:  Central  Bureau  of  Statistics  (BPS),  Supreme  Audit  Authority  (BPK),  MOF  regional  financial  information \nsystem (SIKD), central government financial report (LKPP). \n\n           7.1 \n \n         45.4 \n           2.2 \n         25.3 \n         19.3 \n           7.8 \n       100.0 \n\n           7.2 \n \n         49.7 \n           1.8 \n         20.6 \n         19.4 \n           8.4 \n       100.0 \n\n           7.4 \n \n         52.7 \n           2.3 \n         20.4 \n         17.5 \n           7.1 \n       100.0 \n\n \n         58.7 \n           1.1 \n         21.0 \n         15.0 \n           4.3 \n       100.0 \n\n \n  82,027.5 \n    3,038.7 \n  34,071.2 \n  32,013.8 \n  13,916.8 \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\nThe  centerpiece  of  intergovernmental  financing  since  2001  has  been  the  unconditional \n22. \nequalization grant, the DAU. Despite political impositions on its implementation (e.g., the \u201chold \nharmless\u201d  provision,13 links  to  payment  of  wages  and  salaries),  this  system  of  transfers  has \nreduced  fiscal  disparities  across  regional  governments.  The  equalization  effects  of  these \ntransfers could have been much more substantial, however, if the \u201chold harmless\u201d provision had \nbeen  phased  out  before  2008,  and  the  entire  DAU  pool  had  been  dedicated  strictly  to \nequalization. As shown in Table 3, the total DAU has increased sharply, from Rp60.7 trillion in \n2001 to Rp179.8 trillion in 2008, but has remained relatively constant at about 4% of GDP over \nthis period. For all regional governments, the DAU provided 52.2% of total resources in 2006, \ndown  from  58.7%  in  2001,  with  the  main  alternative  growth  in  funding  coming  from  DAK  and \nshared revenues. Data on total per capita resources and per capita expenditures show sizable \ndifferences between regions. In 2006 at the extremes Papua province spent about 17 times as \nmuch  per  capita  than  the  lowest-spending  province  (Jawah  Tengah).  Expenditure  disparities \nbetween  the  highest-spending  district  (Kabupaten  Sarmi  in  Papua)  and  the  lowest-spending \ndistrict (Kabupaten Bogor in Jawah Barat) are even wider, at a ratio of 50 to 1 in 2006.  \n\n \nTable 3: DAU Transfers to Provinces, Districts, and Cities, 2001\u20132008 \n \n\n2007 \nActual \n\n2008 \nActual \n\n2001 \nActual \n\n2002 \nActual \n\n2003 \nActual \n\n2004 \nActual \n\n2005 \nActual \n\n2006 \nActual \n\n       3.9 \n\n       3.8 \n\n       3.6 \n\n       3.2 \n\n       4.1 \n\n         4.2 \n\n         4.4 \n\n \n  8,288.4 \n\n \n  8,698.6 \n\n \n  9,183.0 \n\n \n  7,351.3 \n\n       0.43 \n       3.6 \n\n \n  14,571.4 \n\n \n  16,478.7 \n\n       14.5 \n \n       0.40 \n       3.4 \n\n       12.9 \n \n       0.41 \n       3.5 \n\n         4.5 \n \n       0.38 \n       3.2 \n\n         8.9 \n \n       0.33 \n       2.9 \n\n         63.0 \n \n         0.44 \n         3.9 \n\n         13.1 \n \n         0.42 \n         3.7 \n\n \n \n  17,980.7 \n  6,462.9 \n54,279.1  62,202.7  70,230.4  73,328.9  80,170.4  131,114.1  148,308.7  161,769.3 \n\n60,742.0  69,554.0  78,518.8  82,027.5  89,353.3  145,685.4  164,787.4  179,750.0 \n           9.1 \n \n \n         0.40 \n         3.6 \n\nItem \n(In Rp Billion) \nTransfers to Provinces \nTransfers to Districts \nand Cities \nTotal DAU \n% Growth \n(As % of Total GDP) \nTransfers to Provinces \nTransfers to Districts \nand Cities \nTotal DAU \nDAU = general allocation fund, GDP = gross domestic product. \nSources:  Central  Bureau  of  Statistics  (BPS),  Supreme  Audit  Authority  of  Indonesia  (BPK),  MOF  regional  financial \ninformation system (SIKD), central government financial report (LKPP). \n \nDespite  the  low  revenue  autonomy  granted  to  regional  governments,  revenue  sharing, \n23. \nthe  DAU,  and  other  transfers  have  helped  close  the  vertical  fiscal  gap  between  the  central \nGovernment  and  regional  governments,  but  the  horizontal  gap  has  widened  since  2001, \nespecially  among  local  governments.  Because  of  recent  increases  in  oil  and  gas  revenues, \nresource-rich  regions  and  those  receiving  special  autonomy  grants,  like  Aceh,  Maluku,  and \nPapua,  have  seen  very  rapid  growth  in  shared  revenues.  As  shown  in  Table  4,  central \ngovernment revenue sharing with all regional governments rose sharply from Rp21.7 billion in \n2001 (1.5% of GDP) to Rp65.1 billion in 2006 (2.0% of GDP). Revenue sharing is now almost \nhalf of DAU levels and, since much of it is dispersed inequitably (on derivation principles), is a \nmajor countervailing force to DAU equalization. \n \n24. \nThe  decentralization  system  is  still  not  doing  enough  to  reduce  the  horizontal  fiscal \ndisparities.  The  disparities  between  regions  in  public  services  and  standards  of  living  are  still \nquite  considerable  (see  para.  22).  The  Government  is  therefore  emphasizing  regional \ndevelopment policies as the most effective way to bring about more geographic balance and to \nreduce poverty in poorer areas of the country. In a momentous step forward, the Government \n\n         4.0 \n\n                                                 \n13 Under  the  \u201chold  harmless\u201d  provision,  the  DAU  allocation  to  a  region  could  not  be  lower  than  the  previous  year\u2019s \n\nallocation. \n\n \n\n\feffectively  removed  the  \u201chold  harmless\u201d  clause  from  the  2008  budget,  thus  weakening  DAU \nfunding  for  better-off  (mainly  resource-rich)  regional  governments  to  the  benefit  of  regional \ngovernments that were less well off and strengthening the equalization aspects of such funding.  \n  \n\nTable 4: Regional Share of National Tax and Non-tax Revenues \n(Including Natural Resources),  2001\u20132008  \n\n \n\nItem \n(In Rp Billion) \nShared with Provinces \nShared with Districts and Cities \nTotal Shared \n% Growth \n(As % of Total GDP) \nShared with Provinces \nShared with Districts and Cities \nTotal Shared \n\n2001 \nActual \n\n \n    7,511.3 \n  14,177.5 \n  21,688.8 \n \n \n          0.50 \n          1.0 \n          1.5 \n\n2002 \nActual \n\n \n     8,399.5 \n   15,906.6 \n   24,309.1 \n          12.1 \n \n          0.46 \n          0.9 \n          1.3 \n\n2003 \nActual \n\n \n     9,959.1 \n   20,830.8 \n   30,790.0 \n          26.7 \n \n          0.49 \n          1.0 \n          1.5 \n\n2004 \nActual \n\n \n   11,647.2 \n   22,424.0 \n   34,071.2 \n          10.7 \n \n          0.51 \n          1.0 \n          1.5 \n\n2005 \nActual \n\n \n   15,514.0 \n   34,315.0 \n   49,829.0 \n          46.2 \n \n          0.56 \n          1.2 \n          1.8 \n\n2006 \nActual \n\n \n   18,412.2 \n   46,694.8 \n   65,107.0 \n          30.7 \n \n          0.55 \n          1.4 \n          2.0 \n\na Excludes transfers from the provinces.  \nSources:  Central  Bureau  of  Statistics  (BPS),  Supreme  Audit  Authority  of  Indonesia  (BPK),  MOF  regional  financial \ninformation system (SIKD), central government financial report (LKPP). \n\nB. \n\nIssues and Opportunities \n\n25. \nThe extensive diagnostic work undertaken jointly by ADB and the Government in 2006 \nand  2007  revealed  highly  important  policy  issues,  which  can  be  appropriately  sequenced  for \nreform during the LGFGR 2 period. The more important of these are set out below and are also \naddressed in part IV (Proposed Program). Appendix 5 and Supplementary Appendix A provide \ndetailed analyses of fiscal decentralization, service delivery, and governance issues.  \n \nProliferation  of  New  Regional  Governments.  A  noticeable  feature  of  Indonesia\u2019s \n26. \ndecentralization  system  is  the  proliferation  of  regional  governments.  Six  new  provinces  and \nmore than 100 local governments have been created since 1999, and many more proposals are \nwaiting  in  the  wings.  This  trend,  partly  an  opportunistic  response  to  fiscal  incentives  in  the \nsystem, particularly the sharing of resource revenues, is widely perceived to reduce the overall \nefficiency of regional governments. Recent policies have slowed down new approvals, and then \nimposed  a  moratorium  (since  lifted)  on  approvals  pending  the  completion  of  a  revised  policy \nframework.  The  costs  of  proliferation  are  considerable:  economies  of  scale  are  lost  in  the \ndelivery  of  public  services,  unit  costs  go  up,  and  the  new  governments,  lacking  a  sound \neconomic  base  to  raise  their  own  revenues,  could  end  up  depending  even  more  on  transfers \nfrom the center. On the other hand, local residents gain more representation and access to their \nlocal representatives, and regional governments are pushed to become more accountable and \nefficient  in  their  daily  operations.  Where  the  new  regional  governments  lie  in  the  balance  of \nefficiency  considerations  versus  enhanced  representation  and  accountability  remains  an  open \nquestion pending further study, now under way.  \n \nVertical  Structure  of  Subnational  Governments.  The  first  decentralization  reforms \n27. \nremoved hierarchical relationships between the provinces and the districts and cities. But more \nrecent  reforms  under  law  32/2004  have  introduced  new  forms  of  hierarchical  control  by  the \nprovinces,  including  the  approval  of  the  annual  budgets  of  local  governments.  These  policy \nchanges are motivated by a perceived need to strengthen central oversight and control over the \nlocal  governments  through  the  provincial  authorities,  especially  the  governors.  The  new  setup \nhas  benefits,  but  there  are  costs  as  well,  including  biased  actions  by  intermediate-level \n\n11 \n\n \n\n\f12 \n\n \n\nfunctions  are \n\nExpenditure  Assignments.  Government \n\ngovernments  against  local  governments  and  the  difficulty  of  finding  a  true  proxy  that  would \npursue  the  policy  objectives  of  the  central  Government  vis-\u00e0-vis  the  local  governments.  The \npros  and  cons  of  reverting  to  hierarchical  relationships  between  provincial  and  local \ngovernments must therefore be carefully assessed.  \n \n28. \nimprecisely  defined. \nLaw 22/1999,  taking  an  all-inclusive  approach  to  the  responsibilities  of  regional  governments, \nsimply  listed  the  exclusive  functions  of  the  central  Government  and  did  not  make  clear  which \nother functions were obligatory and which were optional for regional governments. Sector laws \nin decentralized functional areas were never amended to conform to the decentralization laws. \nFull  clarification  of  the  obligatory  functions  of  regional  governments  was  also  not  made  in  law \n32/2004  but  instead  was  deferred  until  the  issuance  of  government  regulation  38/2007.  Over \ntime, line ministries and other central agencies have encroached on expenditure functions that \nhad apparently been assigned to regional governments by using \u201cdeconcentrated funds.\u201d Thus, \nthere  is  confusion  in  expenditure  assignments  of  responsibilities  and,  at  times,  opposing \ndirections  in  central  government  policy  objectives.  For  example,  while  the  central  Government \nhas pursued regional equalization through the DAU, the regional distribution of deconcentrated \nfunds  has  tended  to  widen  the  fiscal  disparities  by  generally  benefiting  regional  governments \nthat  are  better  off.  Policies,  sector  laws,  and  regulations  must  be  better  aligned  with  this  new \nregulation.  This  work  has  begun  in  some  pilot  ministries.  It  remains  to  be  seen,  however, \nwhether the new government regulation indeed clarifies expenditure assignments, particularly in \nareas of joint responsibility, and whether it has sufficient legal standing to reverse or nullify laws.   \n \n29. \n Revenue  Assignments.  Reforms  have  so  far  failed  to  give  the  regional  governments \nsignificant tax autonomy. Hence, political accountability among these governments is low, public \nservice  delivery  less  efficient,  and  fiscal  responsibility  diminished.  In  2006,  provincial \nown-source revenues (Pendapatan Asli Daerah, or PAD) made up 42.5% of provincial revenues \nwhile local government PAD represented only 5.9% of total local revenues. These proportions \nhave  not  changed  much  since  2001.14 Law  34/2000  allows  regional  governments  to  impose \ntheir  own  taxes  and  charges  subject  to  limited  monitoring  and  control  by  the  central \nGovernment.  Nuisance  taxes  have  often  been  the  result.  Draft  revisions  in  law  34/2000  now \npending  before  the  DPR  restrict  the  taxes  and  charges  levied  by  regional  governments  to  a \npredetermined (or closed) list. However, two questions remain: whether the closed list of taxes \nwill  offer  substantial  traditional  tax  bases  to  the  regional  governments,  and  whether  the \nGovernment  will  set  aside  enough  resources  for  monitoring  compliance  and  reducing  the \nnuisance taxes and charges.  \n \n30. \nAny  further  devolution  of  taxing  powers  must  recognize  the  limited  administrative \ncapacity and high collection inefficiency of many regional governments. The best candidate for \ndevolution  remains  the  property  tax,  now  administered  fully  by  the  central  Government,  which \ndefines the tax base and sets the rates and then distributes the collected revenues among the \nregional  governments,  while  retaining  9%  of  receipts  as  an  administrative  fee.15 The  property \ntax is not used at its full potential\u2014the valuation of properties is deficient and the statutory rates \nare  very  low  (0.1%\u20130.2%).  Collection  efficiency  is  also  very  low,  with  less  than  half  of  the  tax \nliabilities estimated to be finally collected. One option for devolving the property tax would be to \n\n                                                 \n14 Most  regional  revenues  are  raised  by  provincial  governments,  especially  from  motor  vehicle  registration,  title \ntransfer and registration, and interest income. Key revenue sources for local governments are taxes on electricity \nand on hotels and restaurants, and fees from health clinics, building permits, and public markets.  \n\n15 In 2005 property revenue  was Rp16 trillion, amply  exceeding PAD revenues. However, property taxes on mining \n\n(mainly oil and gas) were 75% of revenues, urban areas 20%, and rural areas only 3.4%. \n\n\fgive the regional governments discretion to set rates between a minimum and a maximum set \nby the DPR. The administration of the tax could stay centralized at first, although the collection \nfee  of  9%  should  be  reviewed.  Over  time,  it  may  be  possible  to  further  decentralize \nadministration  in  stages,  with  better-managed  governments  taking  on  more  responsibilities \nearlier  than  those  with  less  management  capacity.  In  the  recent  past,  opposition  to  the \ndecentralization  of  the  property  tax  within  the  MOF  has  been  interpreted  largely  as  defending \nturf. Decentralizing the property tax would provide the regional governments with a very visible \nand considerable source of financing in the future, enhancing accountability and future budget \nneeds.  The  weighty  issue  of  property  tax  devolution  is  now  being  closely  reviewed  by  the \nGovernment  and  the  DPR  and  in  a  major  breakthrough  is  now  part  of  the  current  round  of \nproposed amendments to law 34/2000 that are being addressed by the DPR. \n \nUnconditional  Equalization  Grant  (DAU).  This  continues  to  be  at  the  center  of  the \n31. \ndecentralization  system  in  Indonesia  and  represents  by  far  the  main  form  of  transfer  from  the \ncentral  Government  to  the  regional  governments.  The  subject  of  constant  reform  since  its \nintroduction  in  2001,  the  DAU  has  progressively  risen  to  26%  of  net  central  government \nrevenues  from  2004,  employing  the  formula  of  fiscal  gap  (the  difference  between  expenditure \nneeds and fiscal capacity) plus basic allocation. The present computation of fiscal capacity fully \nincludes  all  shared  revenues,  including  those  from  natural  resources,  in  addition  to  own \nrevenues  of  regional  governments.  In  computing  the  index  of  expenditure  needs  the  Human \nDevelopment  Index  is  now  used  instead  of  the  poverty  gap  indicator  of  the  past,  and  gross \nregional  domestic  product  per  capita  has  been  added  as  another  factor  to  the  formula.  The \nformula  for  computing  the  fiscal  gap  needs  continuous  fine-tuning.  The  estimation  of  own \nrevenues  in  the  computation  of  fiscal  capacity  could  be  further  refined  to  further  reflect \ndisparities  in  tax  bases;  however,  this  refinement  may  not  be  immediately  feasible,  given  the \nlack of data. The method of computing expenditure needs is now based on a weighted index of \nseveral  indicators.  This  index  is  at  best  an  approximation  of  expenditure  needs,  since  not  all \ndrivers of need are included in the computation  and those that are do not necessarily capture \nwell what drives needs. A more desirable way to compute expenditure needs would be based \non the direct application of minimum service standards (MSS) for service delivery, provided that \nthe regional budgets can accommodate these norms. However, broadly applied MSS are still a \nlong way from being finalized. \n \n32. \nUntil  2008,  the  actual  distribution  of  DAU  transfers  was  subject  to  a  \u201chold  harmless\u201d \nprovision, by which no regional government could receive less in transfers than what it received \nthe previous year. This  provision effectively  worked against the equalizing effects of the DAU, \nsince even regional governments for which the estimate of fiscal capacity exceeded expenditure \nneeds  continued  to  receive  transfers.  In  2008,  in  a  highly  important  move  the  Government \neffectively  eliminated  the  provision,  thus  significantly  improving  horizontal  equity  between \nregional  governments  (although  adversely  affected  regional  governments  receive  limited \ncompensatory funding through other non-DAU parts of the budget).  \n \n33. \nThe  funding  of  the  significant  wage  bills  of  all  regional  governments  through  the  basic \nallocation  of  the  DAU  has  also  introduced  serious  perverse  incentives  to  employ  more  staff \ndespite  broad  concerns  about  the  excessive  administrative  costs  of  regional  governments. \nStaffing  efficiency  varies  widely  between  regions.  In  2006,  among  the  local  governments,  the \nextremes were 0.44 staff for every 1,000 people in Kabupaten Serdang Berdagi and 111.7 for \nevery  1,000  in  Kabupaten  Halmahera  Tengah.  The  current  arrangements  create  powerful \nincentives for regional governments to lobby for more staff and send the wrong signal to these \nregional governments about how to operate in the future. Since any reductions in the wage bill \nwill  simply  mean  a  reduction  in  the  level  of  DAU  transfers  with  a  year\u2019s  lag,  regional \n\n13 \n\n \n\n\f14 \n\n \n\nSpecific  Allocation  Fund \n\ngovernments are discouraged from streamlining their civil service. There is considerable room \nfor increasing the efficiency of regional governments and reversing the negative message sent \nby  the  current  arrangements  with  the  \u201cbasic  allocation.\u201d  A  number  of  reform  options  are  now \nbeing  closely  considered.  One  option  would  be  to  repeal  completely  the  wage  bill  reforms  of \n2006. Another option would be to fund the wage bill of the regional governments according to a \nparticular formula for structuring relative to size and to allow the governments to use the funds \nat  their  own  discretion. The  regional  governments  that  wanted  to  streamline  their  employment \nrolls  could  then  freely  do  so  without  penalty.  Other  options  are  being  considered  with  further \nconcrete reform proposed for subprogram 2. \n  \n34. \n(DAK)  and  Deconcentration  Funds.  The  policy \ndevelopment of the specific allocation fund (DAK) and the reform of the deconcentrated funds \nused  by  central  government  ministries  and  other  central  government  agencies  for  spending \nprograms  in  the  regions  are  strongly  linked.  Law  33/2004  provides  for  the  channeling  of \nnon-legitimate  deconcentration  funds  to  increase  the  DAK. 16  However,  the  line  ministries \ntypically seek to delay the shift and are shielded in part by the legal ambiguities in the system \ndue to the contradictions between the sectoral laws and the decentralization laws. Government \nregulation  38/2007,  which  is  intended  to  clarify  expenditure  assignments  and  help  the  central \nGovernment  set  the  ceiling  for  and  screen  the  budgets  of  ministries,  widens  the  scope  for \nidentifying and reallocating non-legitimate deconcentration funds. Another approach to switching \nfunds to DAK would be  to switch deconcentration funds to the DAU and to let those funds be \nused  by  the  regional  governments  for  functions  now  administered  by  line  ministries.  The \napproach  chosen\u2014whether  to  reinforce  the  DAK  or  the  DAU\u2014will  depend  on  the  degree  of \nconfidence in the appropriate functioning of a reformed DAK.  \n \n35. \nThe DAK has increased in absolute and relative importance, from Rp1.1 trillion in 2001 \n(0.08% of GDP) to Rp21.2 trillion in 2008 (0.47% of GDP). However, these funds still represent \na  small  share  of  total  regional  government  revenues  (about  5%  of  total  revenues  for  local \ngovernments  in  2006  with  negligible  recent  provincial  DAK  funding).  There  is  scope  for \nrestructuring and refocusing the DAK on the basis of clear principles and objectives. The DAK \nshould  not  be  burdened  with  the  objective  of  equalization  if  that  is  effectively  provided  by  the \nDAU.  Ideally  a  reformed  DAK  should  be  defined  in  the  context  of  the  emerging  medium-term \nexpenditure framework (MTEF). New arrangements should specify (i) matching requirements for \nregional  governments;  (ii)  conditions  for  structuring  programs  as  general  block  grants  versus \nspecific grants; (iii) the form of allocation and distribution of the grants, including formulas and \ncompetition  through  open  bidding;  and  (iv)  the  role,  if  any,  of  provincial  authorities  in  the \nallocation  of  resources  and  the  monitoring  of  results.  Careful  thought  should  also  be  given  to \nensuring  the  \u201cadditionality\u201d  of  DAK  transfers,  in  particular  making  sure  that  they  do  not \ndiscourage  or  crowd  out  credit  operations  by  regional  governments  to  finance  long-term \ninfrastructure needs.  \n \n36. \nRegional  Government  Borrowing,  PDAMs,  and  Regional  Surplus  Reserves.  The \ndecentralization system in Indonesia is faced with what seems to be a significant paradox. New \nborrowing by regional governments is negligible at present, while basic infrastructure needs at \nthe  local  level  are  huge,  as  evidenced,  for  example,  by  the  fact  that  most  public  utilities \n(PDAMs, etc.) for basic services such as water are bankrupt and operate with broken facilities. \n                                                 \n16  Legitimate  deconcentration  covers  areas  in  which  the  central  Government,  according  to  law  32/2004  and \ngovernment  regulation  38/2007,  has  a  legitimate  role  in  providing  decentralized  service  through  regional \ngovernments (either directly or shared). Illegitimate deconcentration relates to areas of regional activity where the \nlaw  and  government  regulations  do  not  allow  the  central  Government  to  provide  services  but  where  the  central \nagencies are still operating. \n\n\fOn top of that, regional governments are holding on to very large cash reserves amounting to \n3% of GDP, although the extent of the reserves varies widely between regions. Each of these \nissues (lack of borrowing, dysfunctional PDAMs, and very large reserves) could be addressed \nseparately, but considering them together would facilitate effective policy making. With regard to \ncash reserves beyond loan repayment and infrastructure financing needs, regions rich in natural \nresources and with large reserves could be encouraged to create trust or inheritance funds so \nthat  future  generations  might  also  benefit  from  the  exploitation  of  natural  resources  in  those \nregions.  Putting  away  part  of  the  funds  for  future  use  should  also  help  avoid  wasteful \noverspending in the present. \n \n37.  Much of the regulatory attention on borrowing has dwelt on regulating the demand side \nof  local  credit  markets,  including  the  passing  of  MOF  regulation  147/2006  on  the  issuance  of \nregional bonds. The regional credit markets have failed to develop in part because of the poor \nrepayment performance of many local governments. The new regulatory framework introduces \nnew rules for onlending, but the processes remain long and restrictive. The unclear assignment \nof expenditure responsibilities, especially those having to do with obligations for the construction \nand maintenance of infrastructure, has induced regional governments to wait for funds from the \ncentral Government to pay for the needed infrastructure. Direct central government spending in \nthe regions keeps going to functional areas that are the responsibility of regional governments \nbut for which they are less inclined to spend.  \n \n38. \nIn  addition,  public  utility  regulations  stifle  the  demand  for  credit.  For  example,  regional \ngovernments cannot pledge their revenues or assets except in the case of revenue bonds, and \nthey  cannot  guarantee  PDAM  loans.  On  the  other  hand,  poor  maintenance  and  cost  recovery \npractices have made many PDAMs technically insolvent. Further policy development is needed \nto  encourage  PDAMs  to  function  better  (raise  tariffs  to  allow  cost  recovery,  lower  operation \ncosts, and maintain the capital investment) and for regional governments in general to become \nmore responsible in maintaining infrastructure. Improved capital budgeting and implementation \nby the regional governments would also help. Much better debt and financial arrangements for \nthe vast majority of PDAMs that are struggling would significantly improve service delivery in the \nwater sector with resulting benefits for community health. The passage of the new MOF decree \n120/2008,  which  provides  for  more  generous  debt  rescheduling  and  relief  to  encourage \nspeedier restructuring, enhances the prospects. \n \n39. \nCapacity  Building  for  Public  Financial  Management.  As  much  of  the  regulatory \nframework  for  fiscal  decentralization  is  close  to  being  finalized,  attention  is  now  increasingly \nbeing directed at ways to raise systems and human capacity. BAPPENAS is taking the lead in \ntrying to improve planning methods and skills at all levels of government and to link plans and \npolicies  more  closely  to  budgets  in  a  medium-term  framework.  Both  MOF  and  MOHA  are \nhelping  to  disseminate  the  budgeting,  reporting,  and  supervision  requirements  of  the  new \nregulatory  regime,  particularly  in  relation  to  government  regulations  58/2005  and  39/2007  and \nMOHA  regulations  13/2006  and  59/2007,  which  provide  the  framework  for  modern  and \nconsistent  decentralized  budget  and  financial  management.  In  2007,  MOHA  conducted \nspecialized  PFM  courses  for  about  100  officials  of  the  central  Government  and  400  from  the \nregional  governments.  MOF  is  also  training  decentralized  financial  officials  nationwide,  mainly \nthrough  the  regional  universities.  In  2007  it  conducted  training  in  eight  different  locations  for \n1,528  regional  officials.  A  considerable  expansion  of  the  scope  of  training  and  professional \ndevelopment of regional finance officials is planned under subprogram 2 with significantly higher \nfunding commitments from both MOHA and MOF than in recent times.  \n \n\n15 \n\n \n\n\f16 \n\nImproving  capacity \n\nfor  decentralized  planning,  budgeting,  and \n\n40.  MOF  and  MOHA,  with  funding  from  the  LGFGR  1  project  loan,  are  also  involved  in \ndeveloping  new  computerized  financial  management  information  system  (FMIS)  to  support \nplanning,  budgeting,  budget  execution,  reporting,  and  auditing  in  171  regional  governments  to \nbegin  with,  and  possibly  other  regional  governments  later  on.  About  9,642  finance  and \nmanagement  officials  from  regional  governments  will  be  trained  in  this major  capacity-building \nproject.  Moreover,  the  ADB-funded  Sustainable  Capacity  Building  for  Decentralization  (SCBD) \nproject  continues  to  provide  about  40  participating  regional  governments  with  general \nmanagement training and support. Because these two ADB project loans are still disbursing, the \nGovernment has decided not to pursue a further project loan under subprogram 1 of LGFGR 2. \nBut the possibility of such a loan under subprogram 2 has not been ruled out, especially if the \ncurrent  project  support  continues  to  make  good  progress.  Other  development  partners  with \ninvolvement  in  fiscal  decentralization  matters  are  directing  most  of  their  efforts  at  capacity \nbuilding in one form or another (systems, human resources, etc.) in the regional governments, \nin  some  cases  (with  ADB  support)  through  the  leadership  of  MOF,  MOHA,  and  BPK  (see \nAppendix  4). \nfinancial \nmanagement remains a core focus of subprograms 1 and 2 and will require the application of \nconsiderable  resources  from  all  levels  of  government  and  development  partners  over  an \nextended period of time. Under Indonesia\u2019s capacity-building framework, central ministries and \nagencies  must  provide  leadership  and  facilitation  but  the  regional  governments  themselves \nmust  take  ultimate  responsibility  for  improving  their  own  capacity.  There  is  still  scope  for \ndevelopment  partners  to  support  both  centrally  led  efforts  but  also  increasingly  to  engage \ndirectly with individual regional governments or groups of governments. \n \n41. \nDevelopment Partner Coordination. Many development partners are actively involved \nin fiscal aspects of decentralization in Indonesia. Apart from ADB, which plays a lead role in the \nsector,  others  actively  involved  are  the  following:  the  World  Bank,  the  Department  of \nInternational  Development  (DFID)  of  the  United  Kingdom,  the  German  Agency  for  Technical \nCooperation  (GTZ),  the  Australian  Agency  for  International  Development,  the  Canadian \nInternational Development Agency, the United States Agency for International Development, the \nUnited Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the Japan International Cooperation Agency, \nthe  Government  of  the  Netherlands,  and  the  European  Commission.  ADB  is  collaborating \nclosely  with  other  development  partners  in  all  six  core  output  areas  of  LGFGR  2,  especially \nformulation.  The \nthose \nDecentralization  Support  Facility  (DSF),  established  in  2005  as  a  decentralization  umbrella \norganization,  strives  to  harmonize  the  Government\u2019s  needs  and  development  partners\u2019 \ninterventions. The founding members of DSF are ADB, DFID, the Netherlands, UNDP, and the \nWorld Bank. DSF is funded mainly by DFID and is managed by the World Bank under a trust \nfund  arrangement.  A  more  formal  sector-wide  type  approach  to  decentralization  support \ninvolving  all  development  partners  and  government  stakeholders  has  been  the  subject  of \nongoing  discussions,  but  approaches  have  not  yet  been \nthe \nADB-supported LGFGR moves from program 1 to program 2, many development partners are \ninterested in exploring the possibility of harmonization under the broad heading of the NAPFD \nand  the  LGFGR  2  policy  matrix.  Such  an  approach  is  still  far  from  being  achieved  under \nsubprogram  1  of  LGFGR  2,  but  remains  a  useful  medium-term  objective  and  will  be  pursued \nmore  actively  in  subprogram  2,  including  in  relation  to the proposed  revision  of  the  NAPFD  to \nextend the planning framework to 2010\u20132014. \n\ninvolve  sector-wide  planning  and  policy \n\nfully  harmonized.  As \n\nthat  most  heavily \n\n42. \nLessons  drawn  from  LGFGR  1  and  NAPFD  implementation  are  the  most  important.  In \naddition,  a  number  of  diagnostic  assessments  and  experience  gained  in  implementing  ADB\u2019s \n\nC. \n\nLessons  \n\n \n\n\fSCBD loan were also considered in designing LGFGR 2, as were two recent evaluation studies \nthat  looked  into  decentralization  and  capacity-building  issues  in  Indonesia. 17  The  important \nlessons learned are: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nto \n\nLong-term  commitment.  Indonesia  is  still  in  the  early  phases  of  very  major \nfiscal  decentralization  reform.  The  Government  remains  very  serious  about \ndeepening  reforms  and  raising  capacity.  ADB\u2019s  medium- \nlonger-term \ncommitment after LGFGR 1 remains appropriate. \nGovernment  leadership  of  the  program.  A  very  collaborative  and  interactive \napproach to issue analysis and program preparation, driven by the Government, \nhas been taken under LGFGR 2. \nIntensive, not spasmodic, engagement over time. Intensive longer-term ADB \nengagement  is  necessary  for  the  effective  formulation  and  monitoring  of  the \nreform agenda. The rushed processing of LGFGR 1 lessened program credibility \nat the start.  ADB must be involved more intensively throughout LGFGR 2. \nCoordination with government. Decentralization involves complex crosscutting \nissues  with  a  multitude  of  stakeholders,  requiring  close  coordination  and \nconsensus building among central government agencies and between central the \nGovernment  and  the  regional  governments.  LGFGR  2  addresses  the  need  to \nimprove capacity and coordination among relevant central government agencies \nand seeks to clarify the roles of various levels of government. \nDonor  coordination.  Large,  complex  strategic  issues  such  as  decentralization \nrequire active partnering with other development partners. Despite efforts made \nthrough DSF and development partners, engagement with development partners \nin  preparing  LGFGR  1  was  limited.  Further  serious  efforts  to  develop  a  single \ngovernment-led program supported by DSF are warranted over time. \nClarity  of  sector  functions. The continuing mismatch between sector policies, \nlaws,  and  regulations,  on  the  one  hand,  and  the  general  decentralization \nframework,  on  the  other,  needs  to  be  addressed.  LGFGR  2  supports  the \nidentification  of  inconsistencies  and  is  aimed  at  addressing  them  in  two  pilot \nsectors with follow-ups planned. \n\n(vii)  Horizontal and vertical fiscal decentralization. There must be a better balance \nbetween  the  revenue  and  expenditure  responsibilities  of  regional  governments, \nand  issues  of  fiscal  equalization  between  richer  and  poor  regions  must  be \naddressed.  LGFGR  2 \nto  support  vertical  and  horizontal \nimprovements in intergovernmental financing.  \n\nis  designed \n\n(viii)  Capacity  building.  Decentralization  efforts  must  be  complemented  with \nappropriate  reforms  in  organizations  and  systems,  as  well  as  human  capacity \nbuilding,  to  allow  the  regions  to  manage  their  personnel  and  finances  more \nefficiently  and  effectively.  LGFGR  2  is  aimed  at  supporting  systemic  capacity \ndevelopment  in  budgeting,  financial  management,  service  delivery,  and  human \nresources improvement.  \n\n                                                 \n17 ADB.  2005.

In  LGFGR  1,  the  desired  outcome  was \n\u201cincreased  accountability  in  the  management  of  regional  finances\u201d.  In  LGFGR  2  the  outcome \nhas been somewhat broadened to \u201chaving improved organizational capacities and operating in \nfiscal \na  more \ndecentralization,  financial  management  and  service  delivery\u201d.  In  LGFGR  1,  the  desired \nlonger-term impact was \u201cmore effective and efficient delivery of basic public services by regional \ngovernments\u201d.  The  longer-term  impact  sought  under  LGFGR  2  is  broadly  similar:  \u201cimproved \nefficiency, effectiveness and interregional equity of regional government spending\u201d. \n \n44. \nLGFGR 1 had five core output areas, namely: (i) coordination and planning; (ii) regional \nadministration; (iii) intergovernmental finance; (iv) planning, budgeting, and PFM; and (v) FMIS \ndevelopment  and  project  loan  planning.  LGFGR  2  closely  follows  these  core  output  areas, \nalthough minor reclassification has increased their number to six. Output areas 1 (coordination \nand  planning)  and  2  (regional  administration)  are  the  same  in  both  programs.  But  while \nintergovernmental financing, regional government revenue policy, and debt management were \nall contained in output area 3 in LGFGR 1, in LGFGR 2 these are now split into areas 3, 4, and \n5. And planning, budgeting and financial management, and FMIS development, which were in \nareas 4 and 5 in LGFGR 1, are all in output area 6 in LGFGR 2.  \n \n45. \nThe  LGFGR  1  period  covered  2003\u20132005,  in  a  medium-term  approach  to  program \ndevelopment,  with  further  program  loans  expected  to  follow  the  first  single-tranche  release  of \n$300 million in December 2005. The report and recommendation of the President for LGFGR 1 \nprovided for 14 indicative actions that were likely to be pursued in a second phase. These 14 \nindicative actions are set out in Supplementary Appendix A, Table SAA.1. As the table shows, \n13 of the 14 indicative actions have been squarely provided for in the LGFGR 2 policy matrix. \nThe  only  exclusion  relates  to  the  then  anticipated  development  of  a  regulatory  regime  for \nregional government bankruptcies, which was not of sufficiently high priority to the Government \nto be included in LGFGR 2. With 20 core triggers, the policy actions under LGFGR 2 go deeper \nthan the levels envisaged at the time LGFGR 1 was prepared. \n \nThe chart in Appendix 5 and Table SAA.2 in Supplementary Appendix A map in a more \n46. \ndetailed way the links between actions under LGFGR 1 and LGFGR 2 (subprograms 1 and 2). \nThe  mapping  indicates  that  the  reform  efforts  undergo  no  significant  broadening  between \nLGFGR 1 and LGFGR 2 (essentially the same core output groupings are addressed in both) but \nsignificantly deepen in LGFGR 2. The most important component that binds the two programs is \nthe  Government\u2019s  NAPFD,  which  is  central  to  the  selection  of  well-sequenced  actions  under \nboth programs. While proposed actions under subprograms 1 and 2 of LGFGR 2 heighten the \nLGFGR 1 reform efforts in several ways, the deepening generally comes from the following:  \n \n\n(i) \n\nLGFGR  1  finalized  higher-level  laws  and  regulations  and  began  work  on \ninstitutional strengthening and capacity building, particularly with support from the \nproject loan; \n\n                                                 \n18 A  fuller  treatment  of  the  links  between  LGFGR  1  and  LGFGR  2  appears  in  Appendix  5  and  Supplementary \n\nAppendix A. \n\n \n\n\f(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nLGFGR  2  (subprogram  1)  is  moving  much  closer  to  finalizing  the  regulatory \nregime  while  intensifying  work  on  critical  policy  reforms  and  on  institutional \nstrengthening and capacity building; and \nLGFGR 2 (subprogram 2) will move to a near-settled regulatory regime with the \nimplementation  of  identified  policy  reforms,  while  further  deepening  efforts  to \nstrengthen institutions and build capacity. \n\nlocal \n\nfinancing,  public \n\nthat  have  supported  capacity  development, \n\n \n47. \nIn  conjunction  with  the  LGFGR  1  program  and  project  loans,  ADB  since  2003  has \nprovided  intensive  interaction  on  decentralization  issues  through  three  loans  and  five  TA \nprojects \nfinancial \nmanagement,  service  delivery,  performance  measurement,  and  reporting  and  information \nsystems.19 ADB  has  contributed  significantly  to  the  achievement  of  LGFGR  2  subprogram  1 \ncore  policy  actions  through  concerted  efforts  with  both  the  central  Government  and  regional \ngovernments.  This  work  has  included  strong  interaction  in  both  the  policy  and  the  investment \naspects  of  fiscal  decentralization.  The  SCBD  project  loan  provides  ongoing  support  to  40 \nregional governments in management capacity building. At the same time, the LGFGR 1 project \nloan  is  supporting  the  implementation  of  computerized  financial  management  information \nsystems  and  related  financial  management  capacity  building  in  171  regional  governments. \nCapacity-building  initiatives  were  designed  and  the  regional  government  tax  law  was  finalized \nunder  TA  4282,  the  NAPFD  was  developed  and  the  legal  and  institutional  framework \nstrengthened under TA 4543, and the DPOD received support in institutional strengthening and \ncapacity building under TA 4682. At present, a regional government performance measurement \nsystem  is  being  designed  and  implemented  under  TA  9082,  while  TA  7010  is  supporting \nmedium-term  sector  planning,  NAPFD  updating,  road  map  preparation  for  local  revenue \nenhancement,  a  study  on  the  devolution  of  property  tax,  the  drafting  of  a  policy  on  the \nproliferation  of  regional  governments,  the  clarification  of  expenditure  assignments,  and  the \nidentification of savings from inappropriate deconcentrated expenditures.  \n \nThe  LGFGR  2  program  cluster  has  various  links  with  the  Poverty  Reduction  and \n48. \nMillennium Development Goals Acceleration Program,20 among them, (i) reforms in the system \nof DAK conditional grants to improve targeting in education and health, and (ii) the development \nof  improved  regional  government  budgeting  and  more  effective  service  delivery  (including  the \nuse of MSS) in the education and health sectors. LGFGR 2 is also closely linked with the DPSP \ntargeting broader policy reform in the core areas  of (i) macroeconomic stability, (ii) investment \nclimate, (iii) public financial management, and (iv) service delivery. \n\n                                                 \n19 ADB. 2003.

The LGFGR 2 \nprogram has six core output areas, as set out below. The program is expected to improve the \norganizational  capacity  of  the  regional  governments  and  enable  them  to  operate  in  a  more \ntransparent,  effective,  and  efficient  policy  and  legal  environment  for  fiscal  decentralization, \nfinancial management, and service delivery. Over the longer term, the program is expected to \nimprove the efficiency, effectiveness, and interregional equity of regional government spending.  \n\nC. \n\nPolicy Framework and Actions \n\nProgram  Cluster  Modality.  The  program  comprises  two  subprograms  structured \n50. \nsequentially  as  follows:  (i)  two  single-tranche  operations  (subprogram  1  from  January  2006  to \nDecember 2008, and subprogram 2 from January 2009 to December 2011) with a well-defined \nmedium-term  framework  specified  at  the  outset,  including  reforms  to  be  completed  by \nNovember 2008 under subprogram 1; and (ii) triggers for subprogram 2, to ensure continuous \ndialogue  with  the  Government.  Subprogram  2  will  be  further  formulated  during  the  LGFGR \nprogram review to allow adjustments in the program based on progress made and changes in \nthe  external  environment.  Such  formulation  does  not  obligate  ADB  to  additional  lending  for \nsubprogram  2,  which  will  be  subject  to  Board  approval.  Specifically,  the  LGFGR  2  program \nprovides for reform and strengthening in the following six core output areas: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nframework  and  program  management\u2014strengthened \n\nDecentralization \nmanagement and coordination of fiscal decentralization matters; \nRegional autonomy and local governance\u2014clearer arrangements for regional \nadministration to improve services and accountability; \nIntergovernmental  fiscal  system\u2014enhanced  equalization,  predictability,  and \ntransparency in the release of fiscal transfers and shared revenues; \nOwn-resource  revenues\u2014more  buoyant  sources  of  local  revenues  to  reduce \ndependency on fiscal transfers; \nRegional reserves and debts\u2014bolstering the management of regional reserves \nand debts; and \nHuman  and  systems  capacity  development,  public  financial  management \nand accountability. \n\n1. \n\nDecentralization Framework and Program Management \n\n51. \nLinks  to  LGFGR  1.  This  output  area  will  ensure  a  strong  legal  and  management \nframework  for  coordinating  and  implementing  LGFGR  2,  and  the  orderly  and  effective \ncontinuation of the decentralization agenda over the medium to long term. In LGFGR, 1 DPOD \nwas newly established under law 32/2004 and related presidential and MOHA regulations. The \nNAPFD, which was completed in 2005, was the core guide in LGFGR 2 preparation and links \nLGFGR 1 and 2.  \n \n52. \nLGFGR  2  Subprogram  1  Triggers.  There  are  two  triggers:  (i)  the  completion  of  the \nupdated  NAPFD,  with  options  for  revisions  in  policy  actions  to  provide  a  medium-term \nframework  for  fiscal  decentralization  reform;  and  (ii)  the  establishment  of  the  new  Directorate \nGeneral of Fiscal Balance in MOF to lead the development of the fiscal and governance aspects \n\n \n\n\fof  decentralization. 21  MOF  is  preparing  a  longer-term  strategy  document  (the  draft  grand \nstrategy for fiscal decentralization) to guide medium-term actions under NAPFD and successive \nLGFGR programs. In the broader coordination of all aspects of decentralization, the DPOD, as \nthe advisory body to the president, has an important role. In subprogram 1, the DPOD initiatives \ninclude  a  capacity  development  report  and  a  draft  2-year  training  plan  for  the  secretariat  staff \ncovering administrative, management, and policy coordination training.  \n    \n53. \nLGFGR  2  Subprogram  2  Triggers  and  Milestones.  Two  triggers  are  proposed  for \nsubprogram  2:  first,  the  grand  strategy  document  will  be  finalized  and will  guide  the  setting  of \nlong-term directions for fiscal decentralization; and second, the leadership role of the Directorate \nGeneral of Fiscal Balance will be heightened through regular consultations with all stakeholders, \nenhanced  flows  of  fiscal  decentralization  information,  and  annual  progress  reporting.  An \nupdated version of NAPFD (up to 2010\u20132014) will be prepared, policy options for strengthening \nDPOD  will  be  further  reviewed,  and  the  DPOD  secretariat  staff  will  undergo  capacity \ndevelopment  and  training.  The  DPOD  board,  technical  team,  and  working  groups  will  meet \nregularly.  \n \n\n2. \n\nRegional Autonomy and Local Governance \n\n \n54. \nLinks  to  LGFGR  1.  Reforms  and  strengthening  in  administrative  areas  of  regional \nautonomy will be undertaken in this output area to improve service delivery and accountability. \nDuring the LGFGR 1 period, law 32/2004 on regional administration and government regulation \n65/2005 on MSS were passed, providing the broad framework for regional autonomy and local \ngovernance. \n \n55. \nLGFGR 2 Subprogram 1 Triggers. The subprogram supports the Government\u2019s efforts \nto  improve  the  policy  and  legal  framework,  in  answer  to  the  problem  of  proliferating  regional \ngovernments.  The  improvements  will  be  achieved  through  a  new  government  regulation \n(78/2007) that addresses the establishment, breakup, and merger of regional governments. The \ntrigger  is  passing  of  government  regulation  6/2008,  which  covers  the  evaluation  of  regional \ngovernment performance, in relation to the establishment and merger of governments and other \nmatters.  Preparations  for  a  draft  grand  strategy  paper  on  territorial  subdivision  have  begun  in \nthe  DPR,  and  are  likely  to  lead  to  further  policy  and  regulatory  reform  to  better  manage  the \nestablishment, breakup, and merger of regional governments. \n \n56. \nSubprogram 1 also supports efforts to clarify the intermediate role of provinces and their \ngovernors  through  a  government  regulation  in  this  area  as  part  of  a  broader  review  of  law \n32/2004 on regional administration. The reform of decentralized civil service arrangements has \nanother trigger: a new government regulation (41/2007) providing principles and guidelines on \nregional  organizational  structures  and  facilitating  the  reform  of  decentralized  civil  service \narrangements.  MOF  has  reviewed  the  possibility  of  delinking  the  basic/staffing  allocation  from \nthe  DAU \nflexible  regional  organizational  and  staffing  arrangements. \nSubprogram  1  further  supports  reforms  to  clarify  expenditure  assignments  across  levels  of \ngovernment,  with  two  triggers:  (i)  the  passage  of  a  very  detailed  government  regulation \n(38/2007) on the assignment of expenditures to different levels of government; and (ii) the start \nof practical work to identify inconsistencies between the new regulation and sector policies and \nlaws,  including  a  detailed  review  of  inconsistencies  in  the  ministries  of  environment,  and \n                                                 \n21 The  Directorate  General  of  Fiscal  Balance  is  responsible  for  all  policy  and  administrative  aspects  of  financial \narrangements between the central Government and regional governments broadly covering the following: (i) fiscal \nbalance including transfers and revenue sharing, (ii) regional taxes and levies, (iii) loans and grants and regional \ncapacity building, and (iv) consolidation of financial information and evaluation of financial performance. \n\nto  support  more \n\n21 \n\n \n\n\fcommunications  and  information.  Draft  legal  amendments  and  policy  statements  are  being \nprepared to rectify the inconsistencies.  \n \n57. \nLGFGR  2  Subprogram  2  Triggers  and  Milestones.  There  are  two  triggers:  (i)  the \nprocessing  of  applications  for  the  establishment  of  new  regions  according  to  the  methodology \nspecified  in  the  new  policy  and  legal  framework,  with  less  emphasis  on  purely  political \nconsiderations; and (ii) the finalization of the framework for addressing inconsistencies in laws, \nand  the  start  of  implementation.  DPR  commission  members  will  be  trained  in  the  new  legal \nframework.  The  legal  and  regulatory  clarifications  on  the  intermediate  role  of  provinces  and \ngovernors will also be finalized. Furthermore, the basic (staffing) allocation will be delinked from \nthe  DAU  and  incentives  linked  to  transfers  will  be  pilot-tested,  to  stimulate  the  switching  of \nregional expenditures from administrative staffing to higher-priority outlays. Finally, the work on \nremoving  inconsistencies  between  sector  and  decentralization  laws  will  intensify  and  at  least \n85%  of  the  ministries  will  review  and  prepare  draft  amendments  to  sector  policies,  laws,  and \nregulations that are consistent with government regulation 38/2007. \n \n\n3. \n\nIntergovernmental Fiscal System \n\n \n58. \nLinks  to  LGFGR  1.  This  output  area  supports  the  Government\u2019s  reforms  to  enhance \nequalization,  predictability,  and  transparency  in  the  release  of  fiscal  transfers  and  shared \nrevenues.  During  the  LGFGR  1  period,  law  33/2004  on  fiscal  balance  and  the  related \ngovernment  regulation  55/2005  were  passed,  providing  the  framework  for  fiscal  transfers  and \nshared  revenues.  Government  regulation  56/2005,  providing  guidelines  on  regional  financial \nmanagement information systems, was also passed. \n \n59. \nLGFGR  2  Subprogram  1.  Under this subprogram,  the  DAU continues as the principal \nform of central funds transfers and is based on the gap between \u201cfiscal capacities\u201d and \u201cfiscal \nneeds.\u201d The first of the four triggers is the review of options for possible delinking of the basic \n(staffing)  allocation  from  the  DAU  to  support  more  flexible  regional  staffing  and  organizational \narrangements  and  to  significantly  enhance  the  equalization  effects  of  the  DAU.  The  second \ntrigger  is  the  removal  in  2008  of  the  \u201chold  harmless\u201d  clause,  which  favored  better-off  regions, \nsignificantly  enhancing  the  equalization  effects  of  the  DAU.  The  Directorate  General  of  Fiscal \nBalance  in  MOF  has  regularly  reviewed  the  DAU  formula  including  the  following  aspects:  (i) \ndisparities in tax bases, (ii) the continued inclusion of all revenue sources, and (iii) the need to \nimprove  indicators  of  expenditure  needs.  The  latest  formulas  and  weights  used  in  computing \nfiscal capacities and needs are now being published as part of budget documents.  \n \n60. \nOver  time,  provisions  will  be  made  for  the  preparation  of  forward  estimates  of  major \ntransfers  as  part  of  a  broader  move  by  the  central  Government  to  an  MTEF  planning  and \nbudgeting system. MOF is preparing a preliminary design approach for such estimates. Under \nsubprogram  1,  the  Government  has  sought  to  reduce  central  government  expenditures  on \nactivities that have been legally assigned to the regional governments to make room for higher \npriorities. Government regulation 7/2008, which provides guidelines for managing the legitimate \ndeconcentration expenditures of the central Government, has been passed. This, along with the \nnew  government  regulation  38/2007,  provides  a  basis  for  identifying  and  gradually  removing \nnon-legitimate  central  government  expenditures.  This  forms  the  third  trigger  by  which  non-\nlegitimate central expenditures for the health, education, and infrastructure ministries have been \nreduced  by  about  Rp4.2  trillion,  with  DAK  increasing  by  24%  in  the  2008  budget.  The  fourth \ntrigger  is  a  detailed  data  analysis  by  BAPPENAS,  MOF,  and  MOHA  in  two  pilot  ministries \n(education  and  environment)  to  identify  further  non-legitimate  expenditures  for  removal  in  the \n2010  budget.  Furthermore,  the  Government  will  increase  funding  and  improve  the  design  of \n\n22 \n\n \n\n\fDAK  to  enhance  the  impact  of  these  expenditures.  A  joint  ministerial  letter  (MOF,  MOHA, \nBAPPENAS) providing for strengthened DAK monitoring and evaluation arrangements has been \nprepared. Work has also started on a new MOF regulation or an update of MOF guidelines on \nthe DAK. \n \n61.  Work under subprogram 1 to test performance- and sanction-based elements of central \ntransfers has begun. A policy paper is being prepared by MOF on the possibility of increasing \nthe  use  of  incentives  and  sanctions  to  stimulate  better  results  in  areas  such  as  the  timely \npreparation  of  budgets  and  financial  and  performance  reports,  and  the  reduction  of \nadministrative outlays. Finally, regional governments have taken a keen interest in ensuring that \nreleases  of  shared  revenues  are  smooth  and  predictable.  MOF  has  made  the  release  system \nmore  efficient;  smoother  flows  of  funds  releases  are  now  based  on  government  regulations \n142/2006 (natural resource revenues) and 217/2007 (oil revenues in Aceh province). \n \n62. \nLGFGR  2  Subprogram  2  Triggers  and  Milestones.  The first of the three triggers will \nbe the formulation of a legal basis for delinking wage payments from the DAU to allow flexible \nmanagement  of  regional  staffing  levels  without  limiting  access  to  the  DAU,  thus  significantly \nimproving  the  equalization  effects.  The  DAU  formula  will  be  further  refined.  The  Directorate \nGeneral  of  Fiscal  Balance  in  MOF  will  regularly  review  and  refine  the  formula  (see  para.  59). \nThe latest formulas and weights used in computing fiscal capacities and needs will be published \nin annual budget documents. The preparation and publication of forward estimates for all major \ntransfers  and  shared  revenues  will  be  the  second  trigger.  The  final  trigger  will  be  the \nidentification and realization of significant further savings of up to 50% in non-legitimate central \nministry expenditures in two pilot ministries. The implementation of the new DAK guidelines will \nconsiderably improve the targeting and impact of DAK expenditures. Finally, the new packages \nof  incentives  and  sanctions  for  central  transfers  will  be  pilot-tested.  Full  implementation  of  all \nthese  intergovernmental  financing  reforms  during  subprogram  2  will  be  highly  significant \nachievements. \n \n\n4. \n\nOwn-Source Revenues \n\n \n63. \nLinks  to  LGFGR  1.  The  activities  in  this  output  area  will  be  aimed  at  reducing \ndependency  on  fiscal  transfers  by  developing  more  buoyant  sources  of  local  revenues.  In \nLGFGR  1,  draft  amendments  to  law  34/2000  (regional  tax  law)  were  prepared.  Inconsistent \nregional government tax laws were also revoked by the central Government.  \n \nLGFGR 2 Subprogram 1 Triggers. The subprogram has two triggers. The first trigger, \n64. \nin support of the Government\u2019s efforts to amend law 34/2000 on regional taxes and levies, will \ninvolve  a  shift  to  a  closed-list  approach  to  regional  taxes,  to  reduce  the  number  of  nuisance \ntaxes and at the same time provide more autonomy to the regions in imposing taxes according \nto  the  closed  list.  In  a  breakthrough  move,  the  DPR  is  considering  devolving  further  taxing \npowers, including the property tax and stamp duty\u2013type taxes on the sale of land and property. \nThe  DPR  is  expected  to  pass  the  amendments  to  law  34/2000  in  2008.  Moreover,  MOF  is \ndesigning  and  implementing  a  computerized  system  for  the  submission  and  processing  of \nregional tax laws that will markedly reduce processing time and enable the Government to weed \nout  inappropriate  and  illegal  regional  taxes.  MOF  is  also  preparing  a  road  map  for  tax  policy \nreform, which will become part of the draft grand strategy for fiscal decentralization. The second \ntrigger is the preparatory work to develop options for gradually devolving the property tax to the \nregions,  with  a  study  being  undertaken  to  develop  proposals  and  draft  legal  amendments  to \nprovide for the gradual decentralization of the property tax.  \n \n\n23 \n\n \n\n\fLGFGR  2  Subprogram  2  Triggers  and  Milestones.  The amendments to law 34/2000 \n65. \nwill  be  disseminated  and  the  tax  regime  will  be  further  reviewed.  The  automated  system  for \nvetting regional taxes will be fully implemented in MOF. The decentralized tax reform road map \nwill  be  closely  aligned  with  the  medium-term  NAPFD  and  the  longer-term  grand  strategy,  and \nwill  be  complemented  by  an  annual  report  from  the  Regional  Revenue  Directorate  of  MOF, \ncharting  progress  in  the  implementation  of  the  road  map.  The  single  and  very  critical  trigger \nunder subprogram 2 will be the implementation of an agreed approach to devolving the property \ntax, including the review of valued assessments. \n\n5. \n\nRegional Reserves and Debts \n\n66. \nLinks  to  LGFGR  1.  This  output  area  is  aimed  at  strengthening  the  management  of \nregional  reserves  and  debts.  In  LGFGR  1,  the  legal  framework  for  debt  management  was \nsignificantly  enhanced,  with  the  passage  of  government  regulation  54/2005  on  regional \ngovernment borrowing, government regulation 14/2004 on the workout of regional government \ndebts,  and  MOF  decree  129/2005  on  the  workout  of  regional  government  debts.  Debt  and \narrears workouts were also initiated in seven PDAMs.  \n \n67. \nLGFGR 2 Subprogram 1. Under this subprogram, the emergence of significant financial \nreserves  in  a  large  number  of  regional  governments  has  become  an  important  fiscal  policy \nissue, and MOF has developed systems for monitoring cash holdings in the banking system in \nresponse. MOF is also developing concepts for longer-term trust fund arrangements, especially \nin  wealthier  regions.  MOF  decree  45/2006,  which  sets  out  guidelines  for  the  submission  and \npublication of regional government debt data for better management of regional debt, has been \npassed.  The  director  general  of  treasury  of  MOF  has  also  implemented  a  computerized  debt \nmanagement and financial accounting system (DMFAS).  \n \n68. \nThe  difficult  financial  circumstances  of  many  PDAMs  have  severely  hampered  their \nability to provide adequate water and sanitation infrastructure. Treasury regulation 53/2006 set \nout  guidelines  for  rescheduling  PDAM  debts.  Under  subprogram  1,  significant  progress  has \nbeen made to restructure nonperforming PDAM debts with the passage of a new MOF decree \n120/2008,  which \nfurther  streamlines  application  procedures  with  more  generous  debt \nrescheduling and relief arrangements to speed up debt restructuring. The three triggers in this \ncomponent  are:  (i)  MOF\u2019s  entry  into  discussions  and  dissemination  with  all  175  regional \ngovernments  and  PDAMs  with  arrears,  to  facilitate  the  participation  of  the  PDAMs  in  the  new \nrestructuring scheme; (ii) the preparation of a draft MOF decree on technical approaches to use \npart  of  the  revenue-sharing  transfers  (Dana  Bagi  Hasil,  or  DBH)  and  DAU  transfers  to  the \nregional  governments  to  meet  outstanding  debt  service  payments  to  the  central  Government; \nand  (iii)  ongoing  support  for  the  development  of  a  regional  bond  market  in  creditworthy \ngovernments  in  selected  pilot  locations.  MOF  has  issued  a  decree  (147/2006)  specifying  the \nauthorities  and  guidelines  for  issuing  regional  government  bonds;  with  dissemination  of \nguidelines and training of concerned officials.  \n \n69. \nLGFGR  2  Subprogram  2  Triggers  and  Milestones.    The three triggers will be: (i) the \nfull  operationalization  of  DMFAS  and  the  improvement  of  information  flows,  which  will  help \nstrengthen  debt  management  and  policy  and  thus  reduce  the  arrears  that  curb  regional \ninvestment  borrowing; (ii) the restructuring of at least 85% of nonperforming PDAM debts and \ntheir prompt payment; and (iii) central government support for the development of regional bond \nissues  in  at  least  five  creditworthy  regional  governments  (including  training,  due-diligence \nstudies, document preparation, private credit ratings, and a strengthened regulatory regime for \ndealing with defaults and bankruptcies). Other actions include the pilot implementation of a trust \n\n24 \n\n \n\n\ffund mechanism in at least two provinces and four local governments, and the implementation \nof the new intercept arrangements for fund transfers. \n \n\n6. \n\nCapacity Development, Public Financial Management, and Accountability \n\n \n70. \nLinks  to  LGFGR  1.    This  component  is  aimed  at  developing  human  and  systems \ncapacity and strengthening public financial management and accountability. During the LGFGR \n1 period, an extensive higher-level legal framework was put in place to underpin reforms in PFM \nand  accountability.  Important  laws  and  regulations  passed  included  the  following:  (i)  laws  on \ndevelopment planning (25/2004) and on the state treasury (1/2004); (ii) government regulations \non  work  plans  (20/2004),  on  budgeting  (21/2004),  on  government  accounting  standards \n(24/2005),  and  on  regional  financial  management  (58/2005);  and  (iii)  a  presidential  decree  on \ngovernment  accounting  standards  (2/2005).  An  action  plan  for  the  implementation  of  the  new \nlegal  framework  was  prepared.  Action  plans  were  also  drawn  up  for  (i)  the  computerization  of \ndata  transmission  for  the  regional  financial  information  system  (Sistem  Informasi  Keuangan \nDaerah,  or  SIKD),  and  (ii)  the  development  of  financial  management  information  systems \n(FMIS)  for  the  regional  governments.  The  Government  also  selected  and  reached  agreement \nwith 171 provinces and districts for their participation in SIKD and FMIS development.  \n \n71. \nLGFGR  2  Subprogram  1.  The Government recognizes that developing capacity in the \nregional governments is perhaps the most important issue to be addressed under LGFGR 2 and \nthat  success  will  involve  considerable  resources  and  effort.  As  the  new  legal  and  regulatory \nregime  has  come  more  fully  into  place  under  subprogram  1,  the  central  Government  has \nredoubled  its  efforts  to  provide  improved  funding  and  coordination,  and  development  partners \nhave  intensified  the  development  and  rollout  of  resources  in  support  of  human  and  systems \ncapacity building in the regions. Improved coordination in capacity building is being addressed \nin  part  through  MOHA  with  the  preparation  of  a  proposed  presidential  regulation  on  capacity \nbuilding, which was drafted under subprogram 1. Elevating capacity building to the presidential \nlevel  makes  it  more  likely  that  capacity  building  will  be  better  coordinated  and  backed  with \nadequate resources. \n \n72. \nSubprogram  1  has  five  triggers  for  this  component:  (i)  MOHA  regulations  13/2006  and \n59/2007,  and  related  Bappenas  and  MOF  regulations  issued  which  guide  systems  and \napproaches to PFM in the regional governments; (ii) MOHA trained 100 central government and \n400  regional  government  officials,  while  MOF  trained  1,528  regional  government  officials  in \nPFM;  (iii)  MOF  designed  a  certification  system  for  new  functional  positions  in  government \nfinance, including those based in the regions (such as the regional treasury offices throughout \nthe  country),  in  the  form  of  a  detailed  draft  regulation  to  be  submitted  to  the  Civil  Service \nCommission  (MENPAN);  (iv)  design  and  development  of  computerized  FMIS  to  support \nimplementation of new SIKD information collection and transmission system in 171 locations for \nimproving financial reporting to the central Government; and (v) government regulation 6/2008 \nhas  been  passed  to  provide  a  comprehensive  approach  to  evaluating  the  performance  of \nregional governments. The new computer-based FMIS and SIKD being rolled out in 2008 and \n2009 will be used to train about 9,642 key users of the new systems and middle and upper-level \nmanagers.  \n \n73. \nIn subprogram 1, the need to improve coordination in collecting and analyzing regional \nfinancial data to reduce bureaucratic overlaps is recognized. Improved coordination (especially \nbetween  MOF,  MOHA,  and  BPS)  is  achieved  through  more  effective  reporting  and  improved \nhigher-level  monitoring  of  reported  outcomes.  Computerized  software  is  being  designed  to \nprovide  and  transmit  SIKD  data  to  MOF  and  MOHA  in  formats  that  are  consistent  with \n\n25 \n\n \n\n\fgovernment  regulations  56/2005  (regional  financial  reporting),  and  13/2006  and  59/2007 \n(regional financial management). The closely related need for better coordinated approaches to \nthe  collection  and  analysis  of  (nonfinancial)  performance  information  by  various  agencies, \nincluding  directorates  general  and  directorates  of  MOHA,  MOF,  BAPPENAS,  BPS,  and  line \nministries,  is  also  recognized.  Arrangements  for  improved  coordination  are  being  developed \nthrough MOHA. Continued efforts are under way under subprogram 1 to compare and publish \nbenchmarked  performance  information  between  regions.  A  MOHA  decree  is  also  being \nprepared  to  provide  more  detailed  technical  guidelines,  including  standard  performance \nindicators for service delivery monitoring. Work is under way to prepare a regional government \nperformance measurement system (RGPMS).  \n \n74. \nLGFGR  2  Subprogram  2  Triggers  and  Milestones.  There  will  be  three  triggers  for \nsubprogram  2.  First,  the  implementation  of  the  presidential  regulation  on  capacity  building  will \nbegin,  while  implementation  of  other  capacity  development  efforts  including  the  following,  will \nintensify:  (i)  significant  additional  government  funding  for  PFM  training  and  capacity  building \nthrough  MOHA  and  MOF  (at  least  25%  growth  yearly  over  the  2008  level);  (ii)  full \nimplementation  of  the  regional  training  plan  for  subprogram  2;  (iii)  implementation  of \ncomputerized FMIS and SIKD data transmission systems, along with training and support, and \ntheir full operationalization in 171 regional governments with free software that will significantly \nreduce  the  time  needed  to  prepare  central  consolidated  regional  government  financial \ninformation (from 3 years to 1 year); and (iv) finalization of regulations and certification of new \nfunctional  positions  for  key  finance  officials.  Second,  the  improved  coordination  developed \nunder subprogram 1 will be implemented under subprogram 2 with enhanced use of electronic \ntransmission and improved access to more timely information on regional budget and financial \nperformance,  including  Web-based  information.  Finally,  the  RGPMS  will  be  functioning  in  at \nleast  40  pilot  locations  in  subprogram  2,  with  a  central  database  allowing  for  transparent \ncomparisons across regional governments.  \n\nD. \n\nImportant Features \n\n75. \nLGFGR  2  has  several  distinctive  features.  First,  it  helps  strengthen  ADB\u2019s  partnership \nwith  the  Government.  By  basing  financial  assistance  on  completed  actions  derived  from  the \nGovernment\u2019s  own  reform  program,  LGFGR  2  strengthens  government  ownership  of  reform \nstrategies, with support from development partners operating in a coordinated manner. Second, \nthe inclusion of policy triggers and milestones for subprogram 2 facilitates broad-based dialogue \non  the  Government\u2019s  fiscal  decentralization  agenda  in  the  medium  term,  with  reforms  flowing \nsequentially  from  LGFGR  1  to  the  two  subprograms  of  LGFGR  2.  Third,  the  LGFGR  program \nhelps to establish an institutional mechanism for achieving better interagency coordination and \nimplementation  of  reforms  across  the  central  Government  and  regional  governments.  Finally, \nthe  program  cluster  approach  helps  to  lay  out  a  comprehensive  set  of  complex  reforms  in  a \nwell-sequenced  fashion.  The  flexibility  provided  by  single-tranche  program  cluster  funding \nallows  adjustments  to  be  made  to  suit  changing  circumstances  within  the  longer-term  cluster \nconcept, without losing focus on achievable outcomes up front, including high-impact outcomes \nto be completed before each Board consideration of financing. \n\nE. \n\nFinancing Plan \n\n76. \nThe  Government  has  requested  a  loan  of  $350  million  equivalent  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary \ncapital resources to support policy action under subprogram 1, as outlined in the development \npolicy  letter  and  the  policy  matrix.  The  loan  will  have  a  term  of  15  years,  including  a  grace \nperiod of 3 years, an interest rate determined according to ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate \n\n26 \n\n \n\n\f(LIBOR)\u2013based  lending  facility,  and  a  commitment  charge  of  0.15%  yearly.22 The  decision  to \nborrow under this lending facility was made independently by the Government, which has given \nan  undertaking  that  the  choice  was  not  based  on  advice  from  ADB.  The  Government  also \nenvisages the need for a loan of $350 million to finance subprogram 2; the loan amount will be \nconfirmed at the time of loan processing in 2011. The reform agenda for subprogram 2 will be \nrefined  to  reflect  progress  and  evolving  circumstances.  The  loan  for  subprogram  1  will  be \nreleased in one tranche after meeting the conditions of the policy matrix. \n \nThe  program  loan  reflects  the  Government\u2019s  development  financing  needs  in  2008 \n77. \n(Table  5).  According  to  the  latest  budget  update  of  the  Government,  the  gross  financing \n(external  and  domestic)  requirement  for  2008  is  expected  to  lower  than  budgeted  at  Rp125.4 \ntrillion,  reflecting  a  lower  deficit  of  about  1.3%  of  GDP.  In  line  with  the  Government\u2019s  debt \nmanagement  strategy  of  diversifying  its  liability  portfolio  by  increasing  longer-term  rupiah  and \ndollar  bonds  and  maximizing  overseas  concessional  development  assistance  financing,  gross \nexternal  borrowing  is  projected  at  Rp47.1  trillion.  With  the  decline  in  borrowing  requirements, \nthe country\u2019s debt-to-GDP ratio is projected to decline further in 2008. The assessment of debt \nsustainability  by  ADB  staff  indicates  that  the  Government\u2019s  debt  stock  and  strategy  are \nsustainable  over  the  medium  term.  The  proposed  subprogram  loan  amount  of  $350  million \nequivalent will help to close the financing gap for 2008. \n \n\nTable 5: Projected Financing Requirements of the Government of Indonesia for 2008 \n($ million) \n \n\nDevelopment Policy Support Program  \nInfrastructure Reform Support Development Program \nLocal Government Financing and Governance Reform 2 (Subprogram 1) \n\nFinancing Mix \nGross Financing Requirements \nLess Amortization \nNet Financing Requirement \nProgrammed Gross External Borrowings \n\nof which: \nADB\u2019s proposed loan pipeline \n\nOther donor  and commercial borrowings \n\nADB = Asian Development Bank. \nNote: Exchange rate: $1 = Rp9,276. \nSources: Ministry of Finance and ADB estimates. \n \nF. \n \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n1. \n\nProgram Management \n\nProposed Amount \n\n13, 518.95 \n           6,694.79 \n             6,824.16 \n             5,077.69 \n\n \n\n                830.00 \n                200.00 \n               280.00 \n                350.00 \n              4,247.69 \n\n \n78. \nThe  MOF Directorate General of Fiscal Balance will be the Executing Agency (EA) and \nwill be responsible for the overall implementation of subprograms 1 and 2 of LGFGR 2 including \ncompliance with all policy actions, program administration, disbursements, and maintenance of \nall  program  records.  MOF  has  established  a  steering  committee  chaired  by  the  MOF  director \ngeneral of fiscal balance with the following as members: the MOF directors general for treasury, \nbudget, and debt management; the MOHA directors general for regional financial management, \nregional  autonomy,  and  government  affairs;  and  the  BAPPENAS  deputies  for  regional \ndevelopment  and  local  autonomy  and  for  development  funding.  Selected  representatives  from \nthe  provincial  and  local  governments  will  be  invited  to  participate  in  meetings  of  the  steering \n\n                                                 \n22 ADB\u2019s Board of Directors has discounted the commitment charge to 0.15%, and waived the front-end fee of 1.00% \n\nfor loans approved from 1 July 2007 through 30 June 2009. \n\n27 \n\n \n\n\f28 \n\n \n\ncommittee,  which  will  coordinate  the  implementation  of  LGFGR  2  policy  actions  with  relevant \nagencies  supporting  the  program.  The  committee  meets  at  least  semi  annually  to  monitor  the \nprogress and oversee the implementation of the program. ADB may be invited to participate in \nthe  meetings  as  an  observer.  Below  the  steering  committee  is  an  implementation  committee \nchaired by the secretary of the Directorate General of Fiscal Balance and comprising about 30 \nsenior  members \nthe  relevant \nimplementing directorates of MOF, MOHA, and BAPPENAS. Selected representatives from the \nprovincial and local governments will be invited to participate in meetings of the implementation \ncommittee. \n \n\nimplementing  agencies, \n\nthe  program \n\nincluding  all \n\nfrom \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Period \n\n \nThe subprogram 1 implementation period is from January  2006 to December 2008. All \n79. \nactions  included  in  the  policy  matrix  under  subprogram  1  have  been  implemented.  By  June \n2009, the Government and ADB will have prepared a subprogram 1 program completion report, \nwhich,  subject  to  the  approval  of  subprogram  2,  will  be  used  as  part  of  the  overall  program \ncompletion report. \n \n\n3. \n\nProcurement and Disbursement Arrangements \n\n \nThe subprogram 1 loan of $350 million will be released in a single tranche when it takes \n80. \neffect  (i.e.,  all  actions  in  boldface  type  in  the  subprogram  1  policy  matrix  in  Appendix  3  must \nhave been satisfactorily complied with before the release of the tranche). The loan proceeds will \nbe  used  to  finance  the  full  foreign  exchange  cost  (excluding  local  duties  and  taxes)  of  items \nproduced in and procured from ADB member countries, excluding ineligible items and imports \nfinanced  from  other  bilateral  and  multilateral  sources.  As  provided  in  ADB\u2019s  simplified \ndisbursement  procedures  and  requirements  for  program  loans,23 the  proceeds  of  the  program \nloan  will  be  disbursed  to  the  Republic  of  Indonesia  as  the  Borrower.  Under  this  program  the \nGovernment  will  certify  that  the  value  of  total  imports  minus  (i)  imports  from  nonmember \ncountries,  (ii)  ineligible  imports,  and  (iii)  disbursements  made  under  other  official  development \nassistance, is greater than the amount expected to be disbursed during the year. ADB reserves \nthe right to audit the use of the loan proceeds and to verify the accuracy of the Government\u2019s \ncertification.  Disbursements  will  be  made  according  to  the  simplified  procedures  for  program \nloans.  As  provided  in  ADB\u2019s  simplified  disbursement  procedures  and  related  requirements  for \nprogram  loans,  all  goods  and  services  procured  must  be  produced  in  ADB  member  countries \nand  originate  in  such  countries,  with  due  consideration  to  economy  and  efficiency,  in \naccordance  with  the  Government\u2019s  standard  public  procedures  and  normal  private  sector \ncommercial  practices  acceptable  to  ADB.  Goods  commonly  traded  on  the  international \ncommodity  market  will  be  procured  according  to  procedures  appropriate  to  the  trade  and \nacceptable to ADB. Subprogram 1 will provide for retroactive financing for expenditures incurred \nby the Government 180 days before the loan takes effect. The Borrower has been informed that \nthe  approval  in  principle  of  the  retroactive  financing  does  not  commit  ADB  to  finance  this \nprogram. \n \n\n4. \n\nAnticorruption and Fiduciary Issues \n\n \n81. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the Government. Consistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability, and \ntransparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged \n\n                                                 \n23 ADB. 1998. Simplification of Disbursement Procedures and Related Requirements for Program Loans. Manila. \n\n\fcorrupt,  fraudulent,  collusive,  or  coercive  practices  relating  to  the  Program.  To  support  these \nefforts,  relevant  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  are  included  in  the  loan  regulations \nand  the  bidding  documents  for  the  Program.  In  particular,  all  contracts  financed  by  ADB  in \nconnection  with  the  Program  shall  include  provisions  specifying  the  right  of  ADB  to  audit  and \nexamine  the  records  and  accounts  of  the  EA  and  all  contractors,  suppliers,  consultants,  and \nother service providers as they relate to the Program. \n \n82. \nFor  the  purpose  of  this  program,  an  assessment  of  Indonesia\u2019s  financial  management \nsystems has been carried out to determine appropriate fiduciary arrangements. The diagnostic \nassessments  were  based  on  the  World  Bank\u2019s  Indonesia  Public  Expenditure  Review  200724. \nDiscussions  with  the  Government  during  the  formulation  of  subprogram  1  have  taken  into \nconsideration  the  ongoing  reforms  identified  in  these  diagnostic  studies.  The  assessment \nindicates that the fiduciary arrangements for the program are satisfactory.  \n \n83. \nIndonesia has a strong record of aggregate fiscal discipline, as reflected in low budget \ndeficits and a relative low level of public debt. The country has made progress in reforming its \npublic  finances  and  a  sound  regulatory  framework  for  financial  management  is  now  in  place. \nThe  passage  of  the  State  Finance  Law,  the  Treasury  Law,  the  Audit  Law,  and  the  National \nDevelopment  Planning  Law  were  significant  steps  that  brought  Indonesia  closer  to  conformity \nwith  international  practice.  The  laws  are  now  being  implemented,  most  notably  to  make  the \nnational  budget  compatible  with  the  international  standard  government  financial  statistics \nclassification, establish a single treasury account to strengthen cash management, and unify the \npreviously  separate  recurrent  and  development  budgets.  Indonesia  has  a  well-defined  budget \nprocess with both the executive and the legislative branches adhering to defined schedules, and \nhigh transparency of the budget. But more attention needs to be paid to improving the strategic \nallocation  of  resources  through  performance-based  budgeting.  Weaknesses  also  remain  in \nvarious  dimensions  of  budget  execution  including  financial  reporting  and  internal  controls  on \nbudget execution by spending agencies. Public investment budgets are disbursed slowly and a \ndisproportionately large share of funds is spent near the end of the fiscal year. \n \n84. \nThe  legal  and  regulatory  framework  for  public  procurement  has  improved  and  the \nGovernment Procurement Policy Office under the president is preparing standard procurement \nprocedures for the country, including standardized bidding documents. However, the capacity to \nimplement procurement has not kept pace. Pilot e-procurement initiatives and the introduction of \ntraining  and  certification  of  procurement  practitioners  are  thus  important  undertakings.  ADB  is \nalso providing a TA to support e-procurement. The State Audit Law has strengthened the role of \nBPK, which now has sole charge of the external audit of all government organizations, while the \nState  Development  Audit  Agency  (Badan  Pengawasan  Keuangan  dan  Pembangunan,  or \nBPKP), together with the inspector general of each ministry, coordinates the internal audit and \nspecial  investigations  of  the  central  Government,  and  the  Regional  Monitoring  Board  (Badan \nPengawasan  Daerah,  or  BAWASDA)  offices  manage  the  internal  audits  in  the  regional \ngovernments.  \n \n\n5. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n \n85. \nADB retains the right to audit the use of the loan proceeds and to verify the accuracy of \nthe  Government\u2019s  certification  of  withdrawal  applications.  Before  withdrawal,  the  Government \n\n                                                 \n24  World  Bank.  2007.  Indonesia  Public  Expenditure  Review:  Spending  for  Development.

The  Government  will  keep  ADB \ninformed of the outcome of policy discussions with other multilateral and bilateral agencies that \nhave  implications  for  LGFGR  2  implementation,  and  will  provide  ADB  with  the  opportunity  to \ncomment on any resulting policy proposals. ADB, in collaboration with the committee, will review \nthe performance of the program 12 months after the loan takes effect to review the outcome of \nsubprogram 1 and prepare for subprogram 2.  \n \n \n\nV. \n\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n\n \nIn  connection  with  subprogram  2,  the  Government  has  asked  ADB  for  a  $1.5  million \n87. \npolicy and advisory TA to be attached to this program. The assistance will support the ongoing \ndevelopment  of  the  reform  agenda  in  regional  government  financing  and  governance  (as \ncontained  in  the  NAPFD  and  the  policy  matrix  for  subprogram  2)  and  its  implementation,  and \nprovide the Government with timely policy advice as needed. It is expected that, in the medium \nterm,  another  TA  amounting  to  $1  million  will  be  needed  to  support  the  reform  agenda  (see \npara. 88). The attached TA will focus on the Directorate General of Fiscal Balance of MOF and, \nsubject to further discussions, will have the following components: (i) revision of the NAPFD to \ncover the period up to 2010\u20132014, (ii) assistance in building a database and financial modeling \ncapacity in the directorate general to support the ongoing review of intergovernmental financing \nsystems, (iii) design and implementation of a system of forward estimates for intergovernmental \ntransfers and shared revenues, (iv) development and dissemination of new DAK regulations and \nguidelines,  (v)  development  and  implementation  of  a  targeted  package  of  incentives  and \nsanctions for selected intergovernmental transfers, (vi) support in implementing the early stages \nof devolution of the property tax, and (vii) human and systems capacity building in decentralized \nlocations. All components and cost estimates are described in Appendix 8.  \n \n88. \nThe  second  TA  of  $1  million  intended  to  achieve  subprogram  2  policy  actions  is \nexpected  to  be  processed  separately  in  2009.  Subject  to  more  detailed  consultations  with  the \nGovernment, the TA is likely to deal with (i) further policy options regarding the future status of \nDPOD; (ii) more efficient use of regional government labor resources with the help of a wage bill \nformula  and  regional  government  discretion  in  the  use  of  the  funds;  (iii)  amendment  of  sector \nlaws and regulations to make them consistent with the new expenditure assignments and other \ndecentralization laws; (iv) support for a creditworthy regional government in developing regional \nbond \ntraining,  due-diligence  studies,  and  document  preparation;  (v) \npilot-testing  and  rollout  of  the  regional  government  performance  measurement  system,  and \ntraining  in  its  use;  (vi)  restructuring  of  regional  government  budgets  and  the  closure  or \nprivatization of low-priority and nonperforming activities or assets, including regional enterprises; \nand  (vii)  inventory  of  FMISs  in  171  regional  governments  to  review  options  for  further \nexpansion.  Supplementary  Appendix  C  describes  all  the  proposed  TA  activities  to  support \nLGFGR 2.  \n\nincluding \n\nissues, \n\n30 \n\n \n\n\fVI. \n\nPROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACT, AND RISKS \n\nA. \n\nExpected Impact \n\nOver the medium term, LGFGR 2 provides for policy, administrative, and legal changes \n89. \nand  capacity-building  initiatives.  The  expected  impact  is  more  transparent,  efficient,  equitable, \nand  effective  management  and  use  of  public  resources  for  regional  development.  The \ninstitutional,  financial,  economic,  and  social  benefits  taken  together  should  improve  service \ndelivery, boost growth and employment, and reduce poverty in the regions. The most important \nexpected benefits are as follows.  \n \n90.  \nInstitutional  Benefits. The medium-term NAPFD will continue to be the framework for \nreform.  LGFGR  2  will  provide  increasing  technical  support  to  the  new  Directorate  General  of \nFiscal  Balance  in  MOF  as  the  lead  national  agency  for  fiscal  decentralization.  Longer-term \ncapacity-building  support  for  the  president\u2019s  decentralization  adviser,  DPOD,  will  help  improve \nthe  coordination  of  broader  aspects  of  decentralization.  Increased  flexibility  in  the  setting  of \norganizational  structures  and  staffing  in  the  regional  governments  will  facilitate  restructuring \naway from high administrative expenditures. Ongoing long-term capacity building (of institutions, \nsystems,  human  resources)  in  the  regional  governments  will  also  be  significantly  supported, \nparticularly  in  planning,  budgeting,  financial  management  and  reporting,  and  internal  and \nexternal audit. \n \n91. \neconomic management at all government levels. The benefits will be as follows: \n \n\nFinancial and Economic Benefits. Most benefits will come from improved financial and \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\nclearer  assignment  of  expenditures  between  levels  of  government,  and  thus \nmore  efficient  allocation  of  expenditures  and  better  vertical balance  in  financing \nbetween levels of government; \nimproved  criteria  for  establishing  new  regional  governments,  leading  to  greater \nefficiency \nregional \nthrough  more  appropriately  established  and  sized \ngovernments; \nimproved technical and policy environment for intergovernmental fiscal transfers \nand  revenue  sharing,  leading  to  more  transparent  and  equitable  outcomes \nacross regions (better horizontal balance); \nimproved  policies  conducive  to  the  development  of  more  buoyant  own-source \nrevenues  for  regional  governments,  including  a  medium-term  road  map  for  tax \nreform and detailed options for decentralizing property taxes; \nstrengthened  management  of  regional  reserves  with  the  help  of  improved \ninformation sources and policies; \nenhanced policies and approaches (including restructuring and intercepting DAU \npayments) \nlong-standing  debt  arrears  of  regional \ngovernments and many of their utility companies; and \nstrengthened  governance  through  coordinated  performance  monitoring  and \nevaluation to improve accountability. \n\nfor  dealing  with \n\nthe \n\n \n92.   Social  Benefits.  While  most  of  the  benefits  will  be  financial  and  economic,  many \nimportant longer-term benefits sought are social in nature, particularly the improved delivery of \nthe many important public services that are now decentralized (including education, health, and \nphysical  infrastructure).  The  benefits  will  take  the  form  of  (i)  better  defined  service  delivery \nneeds and performance in key sectors, and (ii) systems for performance evaluation monitoring \n\n31 \n\n \n\n\fRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\nand  benchmarking  of  regional  government  outcomes  especially  for  meeting  the  needs  of  the \npoor. Appendix 6 discusses the poverty reduction impact of the program in greater detail.  \n \nB. \n \n93.  While  some  risks  are  external  and  political,  the  program  design  and  TA  will  mitigate \nthese  and  other  risks  by  providing  a  strong  broad-based  governance  framework,  with \ntransparency  and  accountability  elements  in  both  the  central  and  regional  governments.  The \npotential risks to LGFGR 2 and the corresponding mitigating measures are as follows: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nRegional  government  leadership  and  capacity.  The  regional  governments \nmay  not  have  the  necessary  leadership,  commitment,  and  capacity  to  innovate \nand  learn  and  to  translate  financial  resource  and  management  systems \nimprovements  into  better  services  and  reduced  poverty.  This  risk  will  be \nmitigated  by  improvements  in  (a)  bottom-up  accountability  with  better  PFM  and \ngreater  transparency  in  reporting,  (b)  vertical  organizational  structures  and \nhierarchical  responsibilities,  (c)  accountability  of  regional  governments  to \noversight  and  coordination  agencies,  (d)  accountability  through  the  electoral \nprocess, and (e) the regional civil service. \nPolitical  change.  National  and  regional  government  elections  are  due  from \n2009.  The  new  national  or  regional  governments  may  not  endorse  the  policy \nframework  in  the  NAPFD  and  LGFGR  2.  But  the  political  and  bureaucratic \nmomentum  of  reforms  has  been  significant  and  growing  with  the  rise  of  reform \nchampions,  and  is  unlikely  to  be  completely  reversed  by  a  new  administration. \nSome  allowance  must,  however,  be  made  for  new  policy  approaches  at  the \nmargins. \nNational coordination. Problems in coordination between key national agencies \ncould still delay program implementation despite the improvements made so far. \nThis risk has been mitigated by the emergence of the new Directorate General of \nFiscal Balance as the leader in fiscal aspects of decentralization and the longer-\nterm capacity-building efforts of the directorate general and DPOD. Moreover, all \nkey stakeholders will take part in revising the NAPFD in 2009, enhancing national \napproaches.  Adequate  representation  of  regional  governments  in  coordination \nbodies will ensure strong ownership. \nFlexibility  of  regional  organizational  structures.  Organizations and their staff \nmay  resist  more \nflexible  organizational  arrangements  and  staffing.  This \nresistance  is  likely  to  be  offset  by  orderly  and  socially  acceptable  rightsizing, \ncombined  with  growing  community  support  for  spending  less  resources  on \nunproductive administration and more on productive activities. \nHorizontal  equity  between  regions.  Political  and  other  pressures  could  delay \nthe more equitable distribution of transfers and shared revenues, and benefit of \nrelatively  better-off  natural  resource\u2013endowed  regions.  But  equalization  has \ngained important momentum with the removal  of the \u201chold harmless\u201d provisions \nof \nin \nintergovernmental financial flows will increase accountability and create a larger \nconstituency in favor of further equalization.  \nRevenue collection in the regions.  Political and bureaucratic opposition in the \ncentral  Government  could  stall  the  further  devolution  of  taxing  powers.  In  a \nbreakthrough move, the DPR is considering devolving property tax in a proposed \namendment  to  the  tax  law.  In  addition,  a  gradual  medium-term  approach  to \n\nimproved  analysis  and \n\nin  2008,  and \n\ntransparency \n\nthe  DAU \n\n32 \n\n \n\n\f(vii) \n\nrevenue reforms, based on a medium-term plan and well-researched and argued \ncases, is being taken and will be supported by LGFGR 2 and other programs.    \nFuel  prices  and  resource  constraints.  Any  increase  in  fuel  subsidies  may \nrequire  the  reallocation  of  resources  from  administrative  expenditure,  including \nreform  programs,  and  leave  the  Government  with  insufficient  resources  for \ncapacity development. The Government has therefore indicated that it will reduce \nthe fuel subsidy over the medium term. In addition, LGFGR 2 provides significant \nTA  resources  to  support  capacity  building  over  the  medium  term  through  2011. \nSupport from other development partners will also be used. \n\n \nConditions  for  Loan  Effectiveness.  The  loan  will  take  effect  after  all  the  tranche \n\n94. \nconditions specified in the policy matrix (Appendix 3) are met. \n\nVII. \n\nASSURANCES  \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \n\n95. \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n\nCounterpart  funds  will  be  used  to  finance  the  structural  adjustment  costs  and \nlocal  currency  costs  relating  to  the  implementation  of  the  Program  and  other \nactivities consistent with the objectives of the Program, as more fully described in \nthe development policy letter (Appendix 2). \nThe  policies  and  actions  taken  prior  to  the  date  of  the  subprogram  1  loan \nagreement,  as  described  in  the  development  policy  letter  (including  the  policy \nmatrix),  will  continue  to  be  in  effect  for  the  duration  of  the  subprogram  1  and \nsubsequently.  \n\nVIII.

The  sections  that  follow  cover:  legal  framework  (section  B);  regional  administration \nissues  (section  C);  intergovernmental  fiscal  arrangements  (section  D);  expenditure  allocations \nand service delivery at regional levels (section E); fiscal decentralization and poverty reduction \n(section F); and capacity building for public financial management (PFM) (section G). \n \n2. \nApart from the direct experiences gained under the First Local Government Finance and \nGovernance  Reform  Program  (LGFGR  1)  and  the  diagnostic  work  on  fiscal  aspects  of \ndecentralization  undertaken  during  the  country  strategy  and  program  preparation  in  2006,  the \ndesign of LGFGR 2 has benefited from a significant amount of sector diagnostic work of fiscal \naspects  of  decentralization  between  2006  and  2008.  This  work  included:  (i)  a  comprehensive \nstock  taking  of  fiscal  decentralization,  jointly  undertaken  by  the  Government  and  development \npartners; (ii) a diagnostic review of issues and preparation of the DSF medium-term work plan \nfor  fiscal  decentralization  of  the  Decentralization  Support  Facility  (DSF);  (iii)  an  extensive \ndiagnostic review of priority reforms considered in the design of the Second Local Government \nFinance  and  Governance  Reform  Program  (LGFGR  2)  and  the  project  preparatory  technical \nassistance  (TA)  for  LGFGR  2;  (iv)  a  public  expenditure  review  with  focus  on  fiscal  aspects  of \ndecentralization;  and  (v)  various  internal  government  reviews  (some  supported  by  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  [ADB]  TA)  of  progress  in  implementing  LGFGR  1  and  the  National  Action \nPlan for Fiscal Decentralization (NAPFD). \n\n \n\nB.  \n\nBackground: Links between LGFGR 1 and LGFGR 2 \n\nimpact  sought  under  LGFGR  2 \n\n3. \nThe details of and lessons from LGFGR 1 were fully considered in the development of \nLGFGR2; 1  the  two  programs  are  integrally  linked.  In  LGFGR  1,  the  desired  outcome  was \n\u201cincreased  accountability  in  the  management  of  LG  finances.\u201d  In  LGFGR  2  the  outcome  has \nbeen  somewhat  broadened  to  \u201cimproved  regional  organizational  capacities  and  operating  in  a \nmore transparent, effective and efficient policy and legal environment for fiscal decentralization, \nfinancial  management  and  service  delivery.\u201d  In  LGFGR 1,  the  desired  longer-term  impact  was \n\u201cmore  effective  and  efficient  delivery  of  basic  public  services  by  regional  governments.\u201d  The \nlonger-term \nis  broadly  similar:  \u201cimproved  efficiency, \neffectiveness and interregional equity of regional government spending.\u201d \n \n4. \nLGFGR 1 had five core output areas, namely: (i) coordination and planning; (ii) regional \nadministration;  (iii)  intergovernmental  finance;  (iv)  planning,  budgeting,  and  PFM;  and \n(v) financial management information system (FMIS) development and project loan planning. As \nshown  in  the  chart  below,  LGFGR  2  (subprograms  1  and  2)  closely  follows  these  core  output \nareas  of  LGFGR  1,  although  minor  reclassification  has  increased  their  number  to  six.  Output \nareas  1  (coordination  and  planning)  and  2  (regional  administration)  are  the  same  in  both \nprograms. But while intergovernmental financing, regional government revenue policy, and debt \nmanagement were all contained in output area 3 in LGFGR 1, in LGFGR 2 these are now split \ninto  areas,  3,  4  and  5.  And  planning,  budgeting  and  financial  management,  and  FMIS \ndevelopment, which were in areas 4 and 5 in LGFGR 1, are all in output area 6 in LGFGR 2.  \n \n \n\n                                                 \n1 A fuller treatment of the links between LGFGR 1 and LGFGR 2 appears in Supplementary Appendix A. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 5 \n\n55 \n\nCore Output Areas of LGFGR 1 and LGFGR 2 \n\n \n\n \n\nLGFGR 2 \n\nLGFGR 1 \n\n1.

The  RRP  for  LGFGR  1  envisaged  a \nmedium term approach to LGFGR development with at least two further medium term program \nloans  to  follow  the  first  single  tranche  release  of  $  300  million  made  in  December  2005.  The \nRRP for LGFGR 1 provided for some 14 indicative actions likely to be pursued under a second \nphase of LGFGR 1. These 14 indicative actions are set out in the Supplementary Appendix A, \nTable SAA.1 with commentary of their treatment in the LGFGR 2 policy matrix. As shown there \n13 of the 14 indicative actions have been provided for in the LGFGR 2 policy matrix. It can be \nnoted that the policy actions under LGFGR 2 go well beyond the levels envisaged at the time of \npreparing LGFGR 1, with current provision in Subprogram 1 for approximately 50 policy actions, \n20 of which have been bolded as core triggers.  \n \n6. \nTable  SAA.2  in  Supplementary  Appendix  A  in  a  more  detailed  way  maps  the  links \nbetween  actions  under  LGFGR  1  and  LGFGR  2  (subprograms  1  and  2).  To  do  this  the  basic \nstructure  of  the  five  output  areas  and  27  final  actions  of  LGFGR  1  are  taken  as  the  starting \npoints  and  then  all  proposed  actions  under  LGFGR  2  (subprograms  1  and  2)  are  mapped \nagainst these. Because the core output areas between LGFGR 1 and 2 are broadly similar it is \nrelatively straightforward. The mapping indicates that there has been no significant broadening \nof  effort  between  LGFGR  1  and  LGFGR  2  but  there  has  been  a  significant  deepening  of  the \nGovernment\u2019s reform effort. The general direction of deepening seems to be from:  \n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 5 \n\n56 \n \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nUnder  LGFGR  1  finalizing  higher  level  laws  and  regulations  and  commencing \ninitial work on central government institutional strengthening and making a broad \nstart on planning for regional government capacity development; \nUnder  LGFGR  2  (subprogram  1)  moving  to  near  finalization  of  the  regulatory \nregime  (including  lower  level  instruments)  and  intensification  of  policy  reform \nwork  to  remove  distortions  and  anomalies,  while  intensifying  efforts  at  central \ninstitutional strengthening and planning for regional capacity building; and  \nUnder LGFGR 2 (subprogram 2) moving to a more mature stage of a near settled \nregulatory  regime  following  the  implementation  of  reforms  to  remove  identified \npolicy  while  further  deepening  efforts  at  central  institutional  strengthening  and \nregional government capacity building.  \n\nC. \n\nLegal Framework \n\n \n\n1. \n\nOverview of the Evolving Framework \n\nThe \u201cbig bang\u201d reforms launched in 2001 involved a massive delegation of responsibility \n7. \nfor the provision of public services and the reassignment to regional governments of two thirds \nof central Government civil servants and more than 16,000 service delivery facilities. As a result, \nthe  share  of  regional  government  expenditures  in  total  government  expenditures  almost \ndoubled,  making  Indonesia  one  of  the  most-decentralized  countries  in  the  world.  The  two \noriginal fundamental decentralization laws were: (i) a law on local administration and autonomy \n(law  22/1999),  and  (ii)  a  law  on  financial  balance  between  the  central  Government  and  the \nregions (law 25/1999). These two fundamental laws were both replaced in 2004 (see parts B3 \nand B4). Since the introduction of the new laws there has been a raft of new government and \nministerial  regulations  and  lower-level  instruments  passed  (more  than  50  of  them)  as \nIndonesia\u2019s regulatory regime moves closer to the end of the current phase.  \n \nFiscal  decentralization  has  also  been  fundamentally  influenced  by  the  passage  of  four \n8. \nrelatively  new  foundation  finance  and  planning  laws  in  2003  and  2004.  These  are:  (i)  law \n17/2003 on finance, (ii) law 1/2004 on the treasury, (iii) law 15/2004 on audit and supervision, \nand  (iv)  law  25/2004  on  national  development  planning.  These  foundation  laws,  which  are \nmodern  in  nature,  drive  the  financial  management  and  governance  aspects  of  the  new \ndecentralization laws and approaches. \n\n2. \n\nLaw 34/2000 on Regional Taxes and Levies \n\n9. \nLaw 34/2000 sets out the taxes and charges assigned to regional governments, while \nat the same time leaving some flexibility to regional governments to design new types of taxes \nand charges that meet the defined criteria. Since 2006, the house of representatives (Dewan \nPerwakilan Rakyat, or DPR) has been reviewing draft amendments to this law, including the \nuse  of  a  positive  list  of  tax  types,  in  part  to  minimize  the  growth  of  nuisance-type  regional \ntaxes. The main prescribed provincial government taxes are those on (i) motor vehicles and \nvessels,  (ii)  changes  in  vessel  and  vehicle  ownership,  (iii) motor  vehicle  fuel,  and  (iv)  water. \nThe  main  prescribed  local  government  taxes  are  those  on  (i)  hotels,  (ii)  restaurants,  (iii) \nentertainment, (iv) advertising, (v) street lighting, (vi) minerals, and (vii) parking.  \n\n \n10. \nThe law sets the maximum tax rates that can be charged. It also provides for sharing \narrangements  between  (i)  provinces,  (ii)  local  governments,  and  (iii)  villages,  in  relation  to \nregional  taxes.  Other  laws  (particularly  law  33/2004)  also  provide  for  sharing  of  taxes \nassigned by the central Government with the regional governments. There is general revenue \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 5 \n\n57 \n\n3. \n\nLaw 32/2004 on Regional Administration \n\nsharing as well through the general allocation fund (Dana Alokasi Umum, or DAU) (26% of net \ncentral  government  revenues  in  2008).  In  reality  regional  governments  have  limited  revenue \nautonomy  as  the  central  Government  has  retained  control  of  the  main  taxes.  Important \nrevenue policy issues that have been under debate for some time are: (i) the limited extent of \nthe  regional  tax  base  and  the  possibility  that  additional  taxes  (such  as  property,  income,  or \nconsumption taxes) might be provided to the regions, and (ii) the fairness of the veto powers \nof the central Government regarding regional tax initiatives. \n \n \n \n11. \nIn 2004 the new law 32/2004 replaced law 22/1999 on regional administration. The new \nlaw aimed for consistency with new laws on public finance, treasury, audit, and planning. The \nlaw covered (i) the formation, breakup, and merger of regional governments; (ii) the assignment \nof expenditures; (iii) responsibilities and authorities of key officials; (iv) the political structure; (v) \nthe  civil  service  structure;  (vi)  higher-level  vetting  of  regional  budgets;  (vii)  planning;  (viii) \nperformance-based  budgeting;  (ix)  borrowing;  (x)  deficits,  reserve  funds,  and  regional \nenterprises;  (xi)  disputes  and  cooperation;  (xii)  village  management;  (xiii)  supervision  and \ncapacity  development;  and  (iv)  the  president\u2019s  Regional  Autonomy  Advisory  Council  (Dewan \nPertimbangan  Otonomi  Daerah,  or  DPOD).  While  fiscal  decentralization  matters  are  mainly \ncovered  in  law  33/2004,  law  32/2004  also  covers  many  fiscal  matters  and  this  has  been  a \nsource  of  confusion  from  time  to  time.  The  new  law  32/2004  to  some  extent  reestablished  a \nhierarchical  role  for  the  provinces  vis-\u00e0-vis  the  local  governments,  addressing  a  perceived \ncentral need to exercise more central government oversight and control. \n \nUnder law 32/2004 the central Government reserved for itself a very short list of national \n12. \nresponsibilities  (international  relations,  defense and  security,  monetary  and  fiscal  policies,  and \nreligious affairs). Provinces and local governments were broadly assigned the same obligatory \naffairs;  however,  the  provinces  operate  region-wide  while  local  governments  undertake  local \nservice delivery. There are 16 obligatory regional affairs under the law, namely: (i) development \nplanning, (ii) planning and zoning, (iii) public order and peace, (iv) public means and facilities, \n(v)  health,  (vi)  education  and  human  resources,  (vii)  social  services,  (viii)  manpower,  (ix) \ncooperatives  and  small  and  medium-sized  enterprises,  (x)  environment,  (xi)  agrarian  services, \n(xii)  demography  and  civil  registry,  (xiii)  government  administration,  (xiv)  capital  investments, \n(xv) other basic services, and (xvi) others. Within the resource availabilities, regions may pursue \nadditional optional affairs. Some services have  authority to  be delivered solely by one level of \ngovernment while others may involve sharing between levels. \n \n13. \nGovernment regulation 38/2007 sought to further clarify the assignment of expenditures. \nThe  government  regulation  reaffirms  the  central  Government\u2019s  control  over  the  seven \nabovementioned  areas  exclusively  reserved  for  it,  then  distributes  all  other  areas  among  the \nother  levels  of  government.  About  31  areas  (or  sectors)  are  joint  responsibilities  (sectors  are \nfurther  divided  into  subsectors  and  sub-subsectors  in  a  detailed  appendix  to  the  government \nregulation).  The  detailed  appendix  sets  out  in  matrix  form  for  each  sector,  subsector,  and \nsub-subsector the responsibilities of (i) the central Government, (ii) the provincial governments, \nand  (iii)  the  local  governments.  Matters  assigned  to  regional  governments  are  further  divided \ninto the mandatory and the optional.  \n    \n14. \nlists  26  obligatory  regional  government  areas \n(compared with only 15 in the law): (i) education, (ii) health, (iii) environment, (iv) public works, \n(v)  spatial  layout,  (vi)  development  plan,  (vii)  housing,  (viii)  youth  and  sports,  (ix)  capital \ninvestment, (x) cooperatives and small and medium-sized enterprises, (xi) population and civil \n\n Government  regulation  38/2007 \n\n \n\n\f4. \n\nAppendix 5 \n\nLaw 33/2004 on Fiscal Balance Arrangements  \n\n58 \n \n \nregistry, (xii) manpower, (xiii) food security, (xiv) women and children, (xv) family planning, (xvi) \ntransport, (xvii) communications and information, (xviii) defense, (xix) state unity and domestic \npolicy, (xx) regional administration and finance, (xxi) community and village empowerment, (xxii) \nsocial  affairs,  (xxiii)  culture,  (xxiv)  archives,  and  (xxv)  libraries.  Optional  affairs  depend  on \nregional  characteristics and  consist of  (i)  marine  and  fisheries,  (ii)  agriculture,  (iii)  forestry,  (iv) \nmining and energy, (v) tourism, (vi) industry, (vii) trade, and (viii) transmigration. \n \n15. \nCentral  ministries  are  now  required  to  issue  by  2009  detailed  policy  instruments  in  the \nform  of  (i)  norms,  (ii)  standards,  (iii)  procedures,  and  (iv)  criteria,  in  relation  to  the \nimplementation  of  regional  obligatory  and  optional  affairs.  Regional  governments  are  to  issue \nsimilar regional regulations by 2008. If the central Government does not issue these statements \nthen  the  regions  shall  determine  their  own  policies  by  issuing  similar  statements.  No  central \ngovernment  ministries  or  regional  governments  are  known  to  have  prepared  the  required \ninstruments,  although  some  are  working  on  them.  Law  32/2004  requires  the  preparation  of \nfurther  detailed  regulations  in  17  different  subject  areas,  the  great  bulk  of  which  have  been \ncompleted in recent years, while a small number are still being drafted. \n \n \n \n16. \nThe new law 33/2004 requires central public finance policy to focus on redistribution and \nstabilization  matters,  and  the  regions  on  allocation,  effectiveness,  and  efficiency  of  services. \nIntergovernmental financing, while based on paramount central authority, aims for fair sharing of \nauthority  and  responsibilities  and  recognizes  principles  of  regional  equalization  and  the \nnecessity of having adequate money follow decentralized functions. The law covers (i) sources \nand  uses  of  regional  financing,(ii)  local  own-source  revenues  (Pendapatan  Asli  Daerah,  or \nPAD), (iii) revenue sharing (Dana Bagi Hasil, or DBH), (iv) natural resource sharing, (v) general \ntransfers (DAU), (vi) the specific allocation fund (Dana Alokasi Khusus, or DAK), (vii) grants and \nemergency  funds,  (viii)  regional  borrowing,  (ix)  principles  of  financial  management,  (x)  budget \npreparation,  (xi)  budget  execution,  (xii)  financial  accountability  and  supervision,  (xiii)  deficit \ncontrol,  (xiv)  deconcentrated  funding,  (xv)  co-administered  funding,  and  (xvi)  the  integrated \nregional financial information system (Sistem Informasi Keuangan Daerah, or SIKD). \n \n(ii) \n17. \ndeconcentrated central expenditures, and (iii) co-administered expenditures. A fundamental aim \nis to provide for reasonable equalization between regions with narrowing of fiscal gaps, broadly \ndefined  as  regional  fiscal  needs  minus  regional  fiscal  capacity.  Funding  sources  for \ndecentralized  matters  are:  (i)  PAD;  (ii)  the  equalization  funds  (DBH,  DAU,  DAK);  (iii)  regional \nborrowing;  and  (iv)  other  sources.  The  central  Government  sets  regional  total  debt  limits \nannually  and  can  also  impose  other  restrictions  on  the  nature  of  regional  government  debt \nissues.  The  law  sets  out  the  general  principles  of  budgeting  and  public  financial  management \n(PFM), which mainly mirror the finance, treasury, and audit laws.  \n \n18. \nAn  annual  financial  statement  (by  way  of  law)  is  submitted  to  the  regional  house  of \nrepresentatives (Dewan Perwakilan Rakyat Daerah, or DPRD) by regional governments by 30 \nJune  each  year  for  the  previous  financial  year.  It  contains  an  audited  annual  financial  report \ncovering  at  least  (i)  budget  realization  (revenues,  expenditures,  and  output  and  results \nperformance of all work units; (ii) balance sheet; (iii) cash flow report; and (iv) notes, including \nreports  from  regional  state  enterprises.  Financial  reporting  is  to  be  in  line  with  government \naccounting  standards.  The  financial  statements  are  to  be  audited  by  the  Supreme  Audit \nAuthority  (Badan  Pemeriksa  Keuangan,  or  BPK)  each  year  and  at  the  end  of  the  term  of  the \nregional head and the DPRD.  \n\nfinancing  categories  are: \n\n(i)  decentralized \n\nresponsibilities, \n\nregional \n\nThe \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 5 \n\n59 \n\nRegional Administration Issues \n\nSince  the  passage  of  law  33/2004  a  number  of  more  detailed  regulations  and  decrees \n19. \nthat further elaborate on matters contained in the law have been passed. The more important of \nthese  are  government  regulations  (i)  55/2005  on  fiscal  balance,  (ii)  54/2005  on  regional \nborrowing, (iii) 56/2005 on the regional financial information system, (iv) 58/2005 and 39/2007 \non  regional  financial  management,  and  (v)  7/2008  on  deconcentration  and  coadministration \nfunds  management,  as  well  as  MOHA  regulations  13/2006  and  59/2007  on  regional  financial \nmanagement. \n \nD. \n \n20. \nProliferation  of  New  Regional  Governments. From 2000 to 2006, six new provinces \nand about 100 local governments (80 kabupaten and 18 cities) were created. Just recently 27 \nnew regional governments were approved by DPR and many more proposals are waiting in the \nwings. This trend, partly an opportunistic response to fiscal incentives in the system, particularly \nthe sharing of resource revenues, is widely perceived to reduce the overall efficiency of regional \ngovernments.  Recent  policies  have  slowed  down  new  approvals  and  then  imposed  a \nmoratorium  (lifted  in  late  June  2008)  on  approvals  pending  the  completion  of  a  revised  policy \nframework.  The  costs  of  proliferation  are  considerable:  economies  of  scale  are  lost  in  the \ndelivery  of  public  services,  unit  costs  go  up,  and  the  new  governments,  lacking  a  sound \neconomic  base  to  raise  their  own  revenues,  could  end  up  depending  even  more  on  transfers \nfrom the center. On the other hand, local residents gain more representation and access to their \nlocal  representatives,  and  local  governments  are  pushed  to  become  more  accountable  and \nefficient in their daily operations. Empirical studies in other countries show that at least 10,000 \nresidents  are  needed  to  exploit  economies  of  scale  in  the  delivery  of  most  services.  There  is \nwide  agreement  on  the  need  for  more  study  and  discussion  to  close  the  apparent  divide \nbetween  the  DPR\u2019s  position  (generally  favorable  to  regional  government  proliferation)  and  the \ncentral executive (MOHA and MOF) position (generally antagonistic to such further creation).  \n \nVertical  Structure  of  Subnational  Governments.  The  initial  decentralization  reforms \n21. \nremoved any hierarchical relationships between the provinces and the districts/cities, partly out \nof  fear  that  strong  provincial  governments  would  spawn  separatist  movements.  The  special \nstatus  Laws  for  Aceh  and  Papua  and  the  general  evolution  of  domestic  politics  removed  that \nreason  for  eschewing  a  hierarchical  vertical  model.  Law  32/2004  brought  back  different \nchannels  of  hierarchical  control  by  the  provinces,  including  the  annual  approval  of  local \ngovernment  budgets.  These  reversals  reflect  a  central  government  desire  for  enhanced \noversight  and  control  over  local  governments  and  using  the  provincial authorities, in  particular \nthe  Governor,  as  a  proxy  for  central  authority.  There  are  benefits  to  be  derived  from  this  new \nsetup, but there are also costs, including the tendency for intermediate level governments to act \nin  discriminatory  ways  towards  lower  levels.  Careful  assessment  is  warranted  of  the  pros  and \ncons  of  reverting  to  hierarchical  relationships  between  provincial  and  local  governments  and \nwhat can be learned from the practice in other unitary states.  \n \n22. \nExpenditure  Assignments.  Government  functions  are  imprecisely  defined.  Law \n22/1999, taking an all-inclusive approach to the responsibilities of regional governments, simply \nlisted  the  exclusive  functions  of  the  central  Government  and  did  not  make  clear  which  other \nfunctions were obligatory and which were optional for the regional governments. Full clarification \nof  the  obligatory  functions  of  regional  governments  was  also  not  made  in  law  32/2004  but \ninstead was deferred until the issuance of government regulation 38/2007. It remains to be seen \nwhether the new government regulation provides the necessary clarity, particularly in areas of \njoint  responsibility,  which  predominate  in  the  regulation.  Furthermore,  the  difficult  task  of \nrevising all sector laws and regulations to be consistent with the new government regulation still \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 5 \n\n60 \n \n \nremains.  There  are  potential  pitfalls  to  the  approach  required  under  government  regulation \n38/2007,  including:  (i)  the  inconsistency  of  instruments  that  may  be  prepared  by  the  central \nGovernment  and  regional  governments;  and  (ii)  the  possibility  that  central  policy  statements \nmay  seek  to  exert  excessive  control  over  decentralized  affairs.  While  the  objectives  of \ngovernment  regulation  38/2007  of  clarifying  expenditure  assignments  at  different  levels  of \ngovernment  remain  valid  and  extremely  important,  the  bureaucratic  processes  prescribed  for \nfinalizing policy instruments and making laws and regulations consistent imply too many more \nadministrative challenges to be practical. \n \nE. \n \n\nIntergovernmental Fiscal Arrangements \n\nOverview \n\n1. \n \n23. \nAs shown in Table A5.1, the total resources available to all regional governments grew \nstrongly from 6.9% of GDP in 2001 (Rp103.4 trillion) to 8.4% of GDP in 2006 (Rp279.0 trillion). \nAll  forms  of  revenue  grew  sharply  in  absolute  terms.  However,  in  terms  of share  of  resources \nthe DAU declined somewhat in importance between 2001 and 2006 (although still at 52.2% of \ntotal resources in 2006). The DAK (4.1% of total resources in 2006, versus 1.1% in 2001) and \nshared revenues (23.3% in 2006 and 21.0% in 2001) have been the main sources of resource \ngrowth  for  regional  governments.  Rapidly  growing  regional  resources  have  led  to  a  common \nview  that  most  regions  now  have  enough  resources  to  make  a  difference  in  the  lives  of  their \ncitizens  and  that  many  regional  governments,  at  least  in  the  short  term,  have  had  difficulties \nspending  their  additional  resources.  The  challenge  for  many  regional  governments  is  not  so \nmuch few resources but rather spending the available resources well.  \n \n\nTable A5.1: Total Resources of Regional Governments \n(Provinces, Kabupaten, and Kota), 2001\u20132006  \n(Rp billion and as % of GDP) \n \n\n2001 \nActual \n\n2002 \nActual \n\n2003 \nActual \n\n2004 \nActual \n\n2005 \nActual \n\n2006 \nActual \n\n \n\n \n  78,414.8 \n    3,363.4 \n  30,290.0 \n  26,059.4 \n  10,605.7 \n\n \n  82,027.5 \n    3,038.7 \n  34,071.2 \n  32,013.8 \n  13,916.8 \n\n \n  69,554.0 \n    2,648.9 \n  24,309.1 \n  22,181.7 \n    5,232.9 \n\nItem \n \n \nTotal Regional Resources \n  89,353.3  145,685.4 \n  60,742.0 \n     DAU \n  11,569.8 \n    4,252.1 \n  1,123.0 \n     DAK \n  65,107.0 \n  49,829.0 \n  21,688.8 \n     Shared taxes and resources \n  40,739.8 \n  37,964.2 \n  15,471.7 \n     PAD \n    4,420.6 \n  15,872.8 \n  15,378.7 \n     Other revenues \n103,446.2  123,926.6  148,733.5  165,067.9  196,777.2  278,974.8 \n     Total Regional Resources \n           8.4 \n          6.9               6.8 \n     As % of GDP \n \n \n% Share of Total Regional Resources \n         52.2 \n         56.1 \n     DAU \n           4.1 \n           2.1 \n     DAK \n         23.3 \n         19.6 \n     Shared taxes and resources \n         14.6 \n         17.9 \n     PAD \n           5.7 \n           4.2 \n     Other revenues \n     Total Regional Resources \n       100.0 \n       100.0 \nSources:  Central  Bureau  of  Statistics  (BPS),  Supreme  Audit  Authority  (BPK),  MOF  regional  financial  information \nsystem (SIKD), central government financial report (LKPP). \n \n\n           7.1 \n \n         45.4 \n           2.2 \n         25.3 \n         19.3 \n           7.8 \n       100.0 \n\n           7.2 \n \n         49.7 \n           1.8 \n         20.6 \n         19.4 \n           8.4 \n       100.0 \n\n           7.4 \n \n         52.7 \n           2.3 \n         20.4 \n         17.5 \n           7.1 \n       100.0 \n\n \n         58.7 \n           1.1 \n         21.0 \n         15.0 \n           4.3 \n       100.0 \n\nOwn Revenues (PAD) \n\n2. \n \nReforms  have  so  far  failed  to  give  the  regional  governments  significant  tax  autonomy; \n24. \nhence, political accountability among these governments is low. Regional governments are still \nfunded  mainly  by  revenue  sharing  and  intergovernmental  transfers.  In  2006,  provincial  PAD \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 5 \n\n61 \n\nmade  up  42.5%  of  provincial  revenues  while  local  government  PAD  represented  only  5.9%  of \ntotal  local  revenues.  These  proportions  have  not  changed  much  since  2001.  Most  regional \nrevenues are raised by provincial governments. While the absolute value of regional PAD grew \nquite sharply between 2001 and 2006 (from Rp15.5 trillion to Rp40.7 trillion), as a proportion of \nGDP it climbed less significantly (from 1.04% to 1.22% of GDP) although it did reach 1.39% of \nGDP  in  2004  before  declining  in  relative  terms.  Consideration  should  be  given  to  enhancing \nthose  taxes  over  which  regional  governments  have  authority  to  change  either  the  rate  or  the \nbases.  \n \n25. \nAny  further  devolution  of  taxing  powers  must  recognize  the  limited  administrative \ncapacity of many regional governments. The best candidate for devolution remains the property \ntax, now administered fully by the central Government, which defines the tax base and sets the \nrates  and  then  distributes  the  collected  revenues  among  the  regional  governments  while \nretaining 9% of receipts as an administrative fee.2 The property tax is far from being used at its \nfull potential\u2014the valuation of properties is deficient and the statutory rates are very low (0.1%\u2013\n0.2%).  Collection  efficiency  is  also  very  low,  with  less  than  half  of  the  tax  liabilities  finally \ncollected. One option for devolving the property tax would be to give the regional governments \ndiscretion to set rates between a minimum and a maximum set by the DPR. The administration \nof the tax could stay centralized at first, although the collection fee of 9% should be reviewed. \nOver time, it may be possible to further decentralize administration.  \n \n\nUnconditional Equalization Grant (DAU) \n\n3. \n \n26. \nRecent trends in DAU transfers are shown in Table A5.2. The total DAU has increased \nsharply, from Rp60.7 trillion in 2001 to Rp179.8 trillion in 2008, with the return to growth in the \neconomy,  although  its  share  of  GDP  has  remained  relatively  constant  since  2001,  at  around \n4%.  The  DAU-to-GDP  ratios  have  also  been  relatively  constant  for  provincial  governments  (at \naround  0.4%)  and  local  governments  (3.6%).  DAU  funding  represents  up  to  80%  of  total \nrevenues for some regional governments, but much less for those with considerable resources \nfrom  revenue  sharing.  For  all  regional  governments  in  2006,  the  DAU  provided  52.2%  of  total \nresources, down from 58.7% in 2001. \n \n\n2008 \nActual \n\nTable A5.2: DAU Transfers to Provinces/Districts/Cities, 2001\u20132008 \n \n2004 \nActual \n\n2006 \nActual \n\n2005 \nActual \n\n2007 \nActual \n\n2002 \nActual \n\n2001 \nActual \n\n2003 \nActual \n\n \n  8,288.4 \n\n \n  6,462.9 \n\n \n  8,698.6 \n\n \n  7,351.3 \n\n \n  9,183.0 \n\n \n  14,571.4 \n\n \n  16,478.7 \n\n \n  17,980.7 \n\n54,279.1  62,202.7  70,230.4  73,328.9  80,170.4  131,114.1  148,308.7  161,769.3 \n\nItem \n(In Rp Billion) \nTransfers to \nProvinces \nTransfers to \nDistricts and \nCities \nTotal DAU \n% Growth \n(As % of Total GDP) \nTransfers to \nProvinces \nTransfers to \nDistricts/Cities \nTotal DAU \n       3.6 \nSources:  Central  Bureau  of  Statistics  (BPS),  Supreme  Audit  Authority  (BPK),  MOF  regional  financial  information \nsystem (SIKD), central government financial report (LKPP). \n                                                 \n2  In 2005 property tax revenues were Rp16 trillion, amply exceeding regional government PAD.

The DAU since 2006 has \nused the formula of fiscal gap and basic allocation funding significant parts of the wage bills of \nall regional governments. The computation of fiscal capacity (fiscal need minus fiscal capacity) \nnow  fully  includes  all  shared  revenues,  including  those  from  natural  resources,  in  addition  to \nown revenues. A \u201chold harmless\u201d provision has effectively worked against the equalizing effects \nof  the  DAU,  so  the  Government  has  effectively  eliminated  the  provision  from  2008  (although \nregional governments that were adversely affected have received some compensatory funding \nof up to 25% of the 2007 DAU through other non-DAU parts of the budget). The basic allocation \nfor wages (always positive) can now be offset by negative equalization allocations. After offsets, \nregions can receive zero (but not negative) DAU.  \n \nOne  recent  policy  issue  has  been  the  use  of  actual  revenue  collection  data  in  the \n28. \nformulas instead of a measure of revenue potential per region (as originally intended), because \nof  difficulties  in  generating  data.  This  diminishes  the  incentives  for  regional  governments  to \nincrease  their  PAD,  as  higher  PAD  collections  are  matched  by  lower  DAU  transfers.  Another \nimportant DAU policy issue has been the serious perverse incentives introduced by the funding \nof the significant wage bills of all regional governments through the basic allocation of the DAU. \nRegional governments are encouraged to employ more staff despite broad concerns about their \nexcessive  administrative  costs.  Recent  proportions  of  funds  allocated by  the  fiscal  gap  part  of \nthe  DAU  formula  have  been  only  around  50% of  the  total DAU  pool.  Moreover,  staffing  levels \nvary  widely  between  regions.  In  2006,  among  the  local  governments,  the  extremes  were  0.44 \nstaff  for  every  1,000  people  in  Kabupaten  Serdang  Berdagi  and  111.7  for  every  1,000  in \nKabupaten Halmahera Tengah. \n\n4. \n\nShared Revenues (DBH) \n\n29. \nIn part because of recent increases in oil and gas revenues, resource-rich regions have \nseen  their  revenue-sharing  allocations  grow  sharply  (by  46.2%  in  2005  and  30.7%  in  2006). \nRecent trends are set out in Table A5.3. Central government revenue sharing with all regional \ngovernments has risen sharply, from Rp21.7 trillion in 2001 (1.5% of GDP) to Rp65.1 trillion in \n2006 (2.0% of GDP). The great bulk of revenue sharing (around 70% recently, up from 65% in \n2001) goes to the local governments. Revenue sharing is now approaching half of DAU levels. \nThe  main  forms  of  revenue  sharing  are  (i)  land  tax  and  buildings,  (ii)  land  and  building  title \ntransfers, (iii) personal income taxes, and (iv) natural resource revenues. \n \n\nTable A5.3: Regional Share in National Tax and Non-tax Revenues \n(Including Natural Resources), 2001\u20132008 \n\n2001 \nActual \n\n2002 \nActual \n\n2003 \nActual \n\n2004 \nActual \n\n2005 \nActual \n\n2006 \nActual \n\nItem \n(In Rp Billion) \nShared with Provinces \nShared with Districts and Citiesa \nTotal Shared Revenue \n% Growth \n(As % of Total GDP) \nShared with Provinces \nShared with Districts and Cities \nTotal Shared Revenue \na Excludes transfers from the provinces. \nSources:  Central  Bureau  of  Statistics  (BPS),  Supreme  Audit  Authority  (BPK),  MOF  regional  financial  information \nsystem (SIKD), central government financial report (LKPP). \n\n \n   18,412.2 \n   46,694.8 \n   65,107.0 \n          30.7 \n \n          0.55 \n          1.4 \n          2.0 \n\n \n   15,514.0 \n   34,315.0 \n   49,829.0 \n          46.2 \n \n          0.56 \n          1.2 \n          1.8 \n\n \n   11,647.2 \n   22,424.0 \n   34,071.2 \n          10.7 \n \n          0.51 \n          1.0 \n          1.5 \n\n \n     9,959.1 \n   20,830.8 \n   30,790.0 \n          26.7 \n \n          0.49 \n          1.0 \n          1.5 \n\n \n     8,399.5 \n   15,906.6 \n   24,309.1 \n          12.1 \n \n          0.46 \n          0.9 \n          1.3 \n\n \n    7,511.3 \n  14,177.5 \n  21,688.8 \n \n \n          0.50 \n          1.0 \n          1.5 \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 5 \n\n63 \n\nA  number  of  policy  issues  related  to  revenue  sharing  are  under  consideration.  First, \n30. \nsome provisions allow equal revenue sharing by province or district. This provides wide scope \nfor distortion and inequity, given the major variations in sizes of provinces and districts. Second, \nrevenue  sharing  is  dispersed  very  inequitably  (mainly  based  on  derivation  principles),  thus \nacting as a significant countervailing force to DAU equalization objectives. Finally, the proportion \nof  revenues  going  to  different  levels  of  government  continues  to  be  a  matter  of  hot  political \ndebate in Indonesia, as is the case in many countries. \n \n\nConditional Grants (DAK) \n\n5. \n \n31. \nAlthough  the  DAK  has  increased  strongly  in  absolute  and  relative  importance  (from \nRp1.1  trillion  and  0.08%  of  GDP  in  2001  to  Rp21.2  trillion  and  0.47%  of  GDP  in  2008),  these \nfunds  still  represent  a  small  share  of  total  regional  government  revenues  (around  5%  of  total \nrevenues  for  local  governments  in  2006  with  negligible  recent  provincial  DAK  funding).  DAK \namounts  are  set  annually  in  the  central  government  budget  to  support  special  activities  in  the \nregions in line with government criteria, although not all regions receive DAK. The law provides \nthree very general criteria for managing DAK: (i) financial needs, (ii) key regional or geographic \ncharacteristics,  and  (iii)  technical  infrastructure  standards.  The  criteria  do  not  provide  for  a \nnondiscretionary approach to the selection of the total amount or specific allocations. Generally \nregions are to provide matching funds equivalent to at least 10% of DAK allocations, although \nthis  requirement  may  be  waived  for  poorer  regions.  There  is  scope  for  restructuring  and \nrefocusing  the  DAK  on  the  basis  of  clearer  principles  and  objectives.  Ideally  DAK  should  be \nreformed as part of the emerging medium-term expenditure framework (MTEF). \n \n\nDeconcentration Expenditures \n\n6. \n \n32. \nThe  deconcentrated  expenditures  of  the  central  Government  in  regional  locations  are \nnow a significant policy issue. In 2006 the central Government spent some Rp24.7 trillion (about \n5.2% of its total expenditures) on deconcentration matters. The great bulk of these funds went \nto  (i)  education  (Rp17.8  trillion),  (ii)  health  (Rp2.7  trillion),  and  (iii)  agriculture  (Rp1.1  trillion). \nOther  significant  amounts  were  thought  to  be  spent  on  infrastructure  but  are  not  formally \nrecorded  as  deconcentration  expenditures.  Law  33/2004  provides  for  the  channeling  of \nnon-legitimate deconcentration funds to increase the DAK. However, the line ministries typically \nseek to delay the shift. Government regulation 38/2007 on expenditure assignments, along with \nthe improved ability of the central Government to set the ceiling for and screen budgets, widens \nthe  scope  for  identifying  and  reallocating  non-legitimate  deconcentration  funds.  An  alternative \napproach to switching funds to DAK would be to switch deconcentration funds to the DAU (e.g., \nthrough  an  upward  adjustment  in  the  26%-of-net-revenue  formula)  and  to  let  those  funds  be \nused  by  the  regional  governments  for  functions  now  administered  by  the  line  ministries.  The \napproach  chosen\u2014whether  to  reinforce  the  DAK  or  the  DAU\u2014will  depend  on  the  degree  of \nconfidence in the appropriate functioning of a reformed DAK. \n\n7. \n\nHorizontal Balance in Regional Expenditure \n\nThere are notable differences in per capita expenditures between regions. In 2006 at the \n33. \nextremes  Papua  province  spent  about  17  times  as  much  per  capita  than  the  lowest-spending \nprovince  (Jawah  Tengah).  Expenditure  disparities  between  the  highest-spending  district \n(Kabupaten Sarmi in Papua) and the lowest-spending district (Kabupaten Bogor in Jawah Barat) \nare even wider, at around 50:1 in 2006. On the one hand, such disparities reflect the limitations \nof  the  DAU  as  recently  structured  to  equalize  fiscal  gaps.  On  the  other  hand,  the  higher  per \ncapita  outlays  in  Papua,  for  example,  are  understandable,  as  it  has  the  highest  incidence  of \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 5 \n\n64 \n \n \npoverty  of  any  province  despite  relatively  high  per  capita  gross  regional  domestic  product \n(GRDP) (Rp29.3 million in 2005, compared with the median per capita GRDP of Rp8.0 million). \nDisparities in public services and standards of living are still considerable across regions, so the \nGovernment is intensifying the emphasis on regional development policies to bring about more \ngeographic balance and to help reduce poverty in poorer areas.  \n\n8. \n\nRegional Borrowing \n\nremain  cumbersome  and \n\nrestrictive,  and  borrowing \n\nA  current  paradox  is  the  virtual  absence  of  new  borrowing  by  regional  governments \n34. \ndespite  the immense  need  for  basic  infrastructure  at  the  local  level.  Much  regulatory  attention \non regional borrowing has focused on regulating the demand side of local credit markets, which \nhave  failed  to  develop  in  part  because  of  the  poor  repayment  performance  of  many  regional \ngovernments.  The  new  regulatory  framework  introduces  new  rules  for  onlending,  but  the \nprocesses \nfor \nrevenue-generating  projects.  Furthermore, \nthe  unclear  assignment  of  expenditure \nresponsibilities, especially those related to construction and maintenance of infrastructure, has \ninduced  regional  governments  to  wait  for  central  government  funds.  In  addition,  public  utility \nregulations stifle the demand for credit. For example, regional governments cannot pledge their \nrevenues or assets except in the case of revenue bonds, and they cannot guarantee the loans \nof  regional  water  utility  companies  (PDAMs).  On  the  other  hand,  poor  maintenance  and  cost \nrecovery practices have made many PDAMs technically insolvent. Further policy development is \nneeded  to  encourage  PDAMs  to  function  better  (raise  tariffs  to  allow  cost  recovery,  lower \noperation  costs,  and  maintain  capital  investment)  and  for  regional  governments  in  general  to \nbecome more responsible in maintaining infrastructure. Regional government improvements in \ncapital budgeting and project implementation capacity would also help.  \n\nis  allowed  only \n\n9. \n\nRegional Reserves \n\nThe large cash reserves of many regional governments\u2014around 3% of GDP\u2014present a \n35. \nfurther  issue  related  to  vertical  balance  in  intergovernmental  financing.  (The  extent  of  the \nreserves, however, varies widely between regions.) Beyond loan repayment and infrastructure \nfinancing  needs,  regions  rich  in  natural  resources  and  with  large  reserves  (e.g.,  Aceh, \nKalimantan Timur, Papua, and Riau) could be encouraged to create trust or inheritance funds to \nbenefit future generations. \n\nE. \n\nExpenditure Allocations and Service Delivery at Regional Levels \n\n \n\n1. \n\nRegional Expenditure Allocations \n\n36. \nRegional  governments  have  come  to  play  the  key  role  in  the  delivery  of  core  social \nservices,  including  education,  health,  and  the  development  of  physical  infrastructure.  In \nassessing  performance  it  must  be  recognized  that  decentralization  is  a  relatively  new \nexperience  for  Indonesia.  Analysis  is  also  hindered  by  data  availability  problems.  From  the \nperspective of functional expenditure composition, the current mix of expenditures is less than \noptimal. Education has become increasingly the most important sector in the regional budgets. \nExpenditures  on  public  health  services  have  not  increased  significantly  and  still  represent  a \nrelatively  low  share  of  public  budgets.  On  the  other  hand,  government  administration \nexpenditure is the second most important type of expenditure in regional budgets. As shown in \nTable  A5.4,  among  the  regional  governments  routine  expenditures  are  around  65%  of  total \nexpenditures and very high proportions of these go solely to personnel costs. \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 5 \n\n65 \n\nTable A5.4: Routine, Development, and Total Expenditures \nof Regional Governments, 2001\u20132005a \n \n2002 \nActual \n\n2004 \nActual \n\n2003 \nActual \n\n2001 \nActual \n\n2005 \nActual \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n62,656.4 \n30,038.6 \n92,695.0 \n \n \n67.6 \n32.4 \n100.0 \n\n73,445.5 \n43,131.6 \n116,577.1 \n \n \n63.0 \n37.0 \n100.0 \n\n102,268.1 \n55,783.7 \n158,051.7 \n \n \n64.7 \n35.3 \n100.0 \n\n84,476.5 \n58,820.0 \n143,296.4 \n \n \n59.0 \n41.0 \n100.0 \n\n95,104.7 \n53,206.8 \n148,311.5 \n \n \n64.1 \n35.9 \n100.0 \n\nItem \n(In Rp billion) \nTotal Regional Expenditure \nRoutine Expenditure \nDevelopment Expenditure \nTotal Expenditure \n(As % of Total) \nTotal Expenditure \nRoutine Expenditure \nDevelopment Expenditure \nTotal Expenditure \na Total regional expenditure = expenditure of provinces, districts, and cities. \nSources:  Central  Bureau  of  Statistics  (BPS),  Supreme  Audit  Authority  (BPK),  MOF  regional  financial  information \nsystem (SIKD), central government financial report (LKPP). \n \nFrom  an  economic  classification  perspective,  a  significant  part  of  the  budget  goes  to \n37. \nwages  and  salaries  (for  teachers,  government  officials,  etc.),  with  salary  levels  still  controlled \nfrom the center. Too little is spent on supplies and equipment. Local health clinics, for example, \noften  lack  basic  medications,  clean  water,  and  electricity,  and  suffer  from  high  absenteeism \namong health personnel. Regional governments also spend too little on physical infrastructure; \ncentral government agencies continue to control around 50% of infrastructure spending, despite \nthe fact that these responsibilities have been legally decentralized.  \n \nFrom the limited evidence available, service delivery performance has been mixed, but \n38. \nthere  are  indications  that  the  quality  of  some  services  has  improved.  A  recent  World  Bank \nsurvey3 concluded  that  decentralized  services  in  education,  health,  and  general  administration \nhave  improved  in  quality,  while  police  services,  which  have  not  been  decentralized,  have \ndeteriorated. It is important to keep in mind that before 2001 access to many basic services was \nvery low and that these deficiencies persist. The broad-based Human Development Index has \nshown some improvement, from 65.8 in 2002 to 69.6 in 2005, and some narrowing in dispersion \nin index levels between provinces.  \n\n2. \n\nEducation Expenditure and Services \n\n39. \nRecent  national  education  expenditures  are  approaching  4%  of  GDP,  up  from  2%  of \nGDP in 2001. With close to 17% of total public expenditures going to education, the country is \nspending  at  good  international  standards  adjusted  for  income  per  capita.  The  lion\u2019s  share  of \ngrowth  in  education  expenditures  has  been  in  the  regional  governments  (especially  the  local \ngovernments),  from  negligible  levels  in  2000  to  around  2%  of  GDP  in  2004.  Nevertheless, \ncentral  government  expenditures  have  not  decreased  very  significantly  (from  around  1.3%  to \n0.9%  of  GDP  in  2004).  Most  of  them  go  to  teachers\u2019  salaries,  with  a  simple  switch  in \nadministrative  responsibilities  from  the  central  Government  to  the  regional  governments. \nEvolution in the quality of education management and outcomes still needs to be assessed over \na longer period with more direct measures of education services, such as attendance rates and \nstandardized  test  scores,  not  readily  available  at  the  present  time,  although  major  quality \nproblems in education delivery are commonly thought to exist.   \n\n                                                 \n3  Kaiser, Kai, Daan Pattinasarany, and G\u00fcnther G.

Chapter 7, pp. 164\u2013207. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 5 \n\n66 \n \n \n40.  Most broader indicators of education performance show some improvement in the first 5 \nyears  after  decentralization  reforms.  Indonesia  ranks  well  internationally  in  primary  schooling, \nwith net enrollment rates recently (2005) increasing to 95.5%. Net enrollment has also improved \nin junior secondary schools (to 65.2%) and senior secondary schools (to 41.7%), and generally \nin  all  seconary  schools  (from  48.6%  in  2000  to  58.3%  in  2005).  There  has  been  some \nimprovement as well in adult literacy, from 89.3% in 2001 to 90.9% in 2005, although there are \nwide regional variations. \n\n3. \n\nHealth Expenditure and Services \n\n41. \nTotal expenditures on public health, despite a moderate increase in recent years, are still \nless  than  2%  of  GDP,  little  changed  from  the  2001  total,  which  was  quite  low  by  international \nstandards.  Public-health  spending  by  local  governments  did  increase  sharply  after  2001  (from \n11.5%  of  sector  expenditures  in  2000  to  42.9%  in  2006).  This  increase  was  largely  offset  by \ndecreases  in  health  expenditures  by  the  central  Government  (from  64.3%  of  sector \nexpenditures  in  2000  to  41.2%  in  2006).  Expenditures  in  the  health  sector  by  provincial \ngovernments have declined relatively from 24.2% in 2000 to 15.8% in 2006.  \n \n42. \nHealth indicators place the country well below other countries in the region in key health \noutputs,  including  life  expectancy,  under-5  mortality  rate,  maternal  mortality  rate,  and \nimmunization rates. Indonesia has the lowest physician density (number of physicians for every \n100,000  people),  vis-\u00e0-vis  its  neighbors  in  the  Association  of  Southeast  Asian  Nations  region. \nThe  ratios  for  nurses  and  midwives  relative  to  the  population  are  higher  than  those  for \nphysicians, but the actual distribution varies greatly between regions. On the other hand, infant \nand child mortality rates do show some improvement since decentralization. The infant mortality \nrate fell from 60 per 1,000 live births in 2000 to 28 per 1,000 live births in 2005. Life expectancy \nhas also been improving, particularly in provinces that are relatively worse off like Papua, where \nlife expectancy improved from 62.7 years in 1996 to 67.3 years in 2005. \n\n4. \n\nInfrastructure Expenditure and Services \n\n43. \nInvestment in public infrastructure has remained low since the financial crisis of the late \n1990s  and is  now  (2006)  around  the  pre-crisis  level  of  about  7%  of GDP,  after  declining  from \n7% of GDP in 1996 to less than 3% in 2001. From 2000 to 2006 public investment by the central \nGovernment grew from 2.2% to 2.7% of GDP; among local governments the growth was more \nrapid,  from  1.3%  to  2.8%  of  GDP.  Over  this  period  provincial  investment  grew  from  0.3%  to \n1.0% of GDP. Household access to water, sanitation, and electricity in Indonesia is among the \nlowest in the region: only 18% of households have access to piped running water and there has \nbeen slow growth in the number of families with access to safe sanitation (18.2 million families \nin 2003 and 19.4 million in 2005). Many local water utility companies continue to be faced with \nfinancial problems following their transfer to local governments after decentralization, and while \nthere  was  a  modest  increase  in  PDAM  customers  of  11.4%  over  the  period  2001\u20132005,  the \nproportion of households with access to piped water actually fell from 19.7% in 2002 to 18.0% in \n2005.  As  shown  in  Table  A5.5,  there  are  wide  regional  differences  in  access  to  infrastructure \n(electricity, water, sealed roads). Access is closely related to the economic and financial wealth \nof regions and is generally low in the villages.  \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 5 \n\n67 \n\nTable A5.5: Village Access to Infrastructure, 2005 \n(% of villages in region) \n \n\nPLN Electricity \n66 \n73 \n32 \n67 \n63 \n55 \n38 \n\nPiped Water Supply \n  9 \n12 \n  9 \n12 \n14 \n  9 \n  3 \n\nAsphalt Roads \n3 \n1 \n4 \n6 \n2 \n5 \n7 \n\nRegion \nSumatera \nJava/Bali \nNusa Tenggara \nKalimantan \nSulawesi \nMaluku \nPapua \n\nPLN = Perusahaan Listrik Negara (the state electricity company). \nSource: World Bank, 2007 Public Expenditure Review. \n\n \n\n5. \n\nService Delivery and Minimum Service Standards  \n\n44. \nThe  Ministry  of  Home  Affairs  (MOHA)  has  been  working  for  some  years  to  define \nminimum service standards (MSS) (generally understood as physical requirements) but has yet \nto produce a comprehensive set of MSS. However, government regulation 6/2007 specifies the \nprocess of preparing and issuing MSS. The goal of achieving a complete set of MSS is widely \nsupported; however, full issuance as envisioned presents major challenges. The main difficulty \nlies in making the standards feasible within the regional budgets when defined in physical terms, \nor  making  them  possible  when  defined  in  terms  of  particular  performance  outcomes.  There  is \nalso  the  danger  that  physical  standards  may  introduce  distortions.  A  possible  compromise \nwould be to adopt simplified minimum expenditure norms specified as expenditures per client or \nper  capita  on  key  obligatory  functions.  Other  alternatives  are  being  considered;  among  these \nare  the  \u201cbenchmarking\u201d  approach  used  in  some  countries,  which  is  consistent  with  the \nperformance  information  to  be  collected  under  the  new  government  regulation  6/2008  on  the \nevaluation of the performance of regional governments.  \n\nF. \n\n Fiscal Decentralization and Poverty Reduction \n\n45. \nThe  impact  of  decentralized  governance  on  poverty  is  likely  to  be  indirect,  with  many \nother  forces  affecting  poverty  trends.  The  poverty  headcount  ratio  has  dropped  consistently \nsince the start of decentralization (from 23.4% in 1999 to 16.6% in 2007) but is still higher than it \nwas  in  the  early  1990s  (13.7%  in  1993).  Moreover,  richer  and  poorer  provinces  have  not \nimproved in the same way: poverty in poorer and mainly agricultural regions is still quite high. At \nthe extremes, 4.6% of the population in Jakarta and 40.8% in Papua were considered poor in \n2007. In 2002 the comparative extremes were 3.4% for Jakarta and 41.8% for Papua. \n \n46. \nOn  the  one  hand,  stronger  economic  growth  and  falling  inflation  have  provided  an \nessential underpinning for poverty reduction. On the other hand, large increases in the price of \nrice  and  other  commodities  that  are  major  expenditures  for  the  poor  more  than  reversed  the \ngains  from  economic  growth  in  some  periods.  Those  below  the  poverty  line  defined  by  the \nCentral  Bureau  of  Statistics  (Badan  Pusat  Statistik,  or  BPS)  declined  from  18.4%  in  2001  to \n16.0% in 2005, but the rate went back up to 17.8% in 2006 because of significant increases in \nthe  prices  of  rice  and  fuel.  Inflation,  which  reached  15.7%  in  2006  after  the  large  fuel  price \nadjustment, fell to 6.5% in 2007. This, together with the Government\u2019s compensatory conditional \ncash transfer program for the poor, helped reduce poverty to 16.6% in 2007.  \n \nAt the same time, inequality has been widening. As shown in Table A5.6, the Gini index \n47. \nhas  increased  consistently  since  2001,  suggesting  that,  despite  declining  poverty,  growth  has \nbeen  slower  among  the  lower-income  groups  than  among  the  higher-income  groups.  The \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 5 \n\n68 \n \n \nincreasing  inequality  is  also  consistent  with  the  declining  pace  of  poverty  reduction.  On  the \npolicy  front,  in  an  increasingly  decentralized  economy  the  effective  implementation  of  fiscal \ndecentralization policy can play an important role in reducing poverty and income inequality. \n \n\nTable A5.6: Poverty, Inequality, and Regional Autonomy \n \n\n2001 \n\n2004 \n\n2005 \n\n2006 \n\n2007 \n\n2008 \n\nItem \nPoverty (million) a \nHeadcount, Rural \nHeadcount, Urban \nTotal \n\n(percentage of population) \n\n \n29.3 \n8.6 \n37.9 \n18.4 \n \n32.1 \n \n\u2014 \n\u2014 \n\n \n24.8 \n11.4 \n36.2 \n16.7 \n \n34.7 \n \n\u2014 \n\u2014 \n\n \n22.7 \n12.4 \n35.1 \n16.0 \n \n34.9 \n \n0.84 \n(0.12) \n\n \n24.8 \n14.5 \n39.3 \n17.8 \n \n35.4 \n \n0.8 \n0.15 \n\n \n23.6 \n13.6 \n37.2 \n16.6 \n \n37.6 \n \n0.79 \n0.09 \n\n \n\u2014 \n\u2014 \n\u2014 \n\u2014 \n \n\u2014 \n \n0.78 \n0.15 \n\ninequality  across  regions, \n\nInequality a \nGini Index \nRegional Equality b \nCoefficient of Correlation between DAU and Poverty \nCoefficient of Correlation between DAK and Poverty \n\u2014 = not available. \na Central Bureau of Statistics (BPS). \nb Based on budget data for 2005\u20132008. \nSources: World Bank and Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n48.  With  significant \nfiscal  balance  put \nconsiderable emphasis on regional equalization. However, in the early years of implementation, \nefforts to address regional inequality were weakened by other political considerations. The main \ninstrument  for  achieving  the  equalization  objective  is  the  balancing  fund  and  its  largest \ncomponent  is  the  DAU.  The  \u201chold  harmless\u201d  provision  (before  its  removal  in  2008)  reduced \nregional  fiscal  equalization  through  the  DAU.  The  second-largest  component  of  the  balancing \nfund  is  shared  revenues  for  both  tax  and  natural  resources.  Natural  resource  revenues  are \nhighly  concentrated  in  a  small  number  of  natural  resource\u2013producing  regions.  The  DAK  is \nanother  important  component  of  the  balancing  fund,  but  so  far  there  has  been  only  weak \ncorrelation between its allocation and poverty (0.15 coefficient of correlation in 2008). Therefore, \nregional  fiscal  equalization  relies  heavily  on  the  DAU,  which  is  also  highly  correlated  with  the \npoverty headcount (0.78 coefficient of correlation in 2008). In addition to the balancing fund, the \ncentral  Government  implements  development  spending  with  deconcentrated  funds.  Recent \nstudies (World Bank, 2006) suggest that deconcentrated spending tends to benefit regions that \nare  already  fiscally  well  off.  In  2004,  deconcentrated  spending  per  capita  was  positively \ncorrelated with total fiscal revenue and, as a result, failed to contribute to fiscal equalization.  \n\nlaw  33/2004  on \n\nG. \n\nCapacity Building for Public Financial Management \n\n49. \nAs  much  of  the  regulatory  framework  for  fiscal  decentralization  is  close  to  being \nfinalized,  much  attention  is  now  being  directed  at  ways  to raise systems  and  human  capacity. \nThe National Development Planning Agency (Badan Perencanaan Pembangunan Nasional, or \nBAPPENAS)  is  taking  the  lead  in  trying  to  improve  planning  methods  and  skills  throughout \ngovernment and to link plans and policies more closely to budgets in a medium-term framework. \nBoth the Ministry of Finance (MOF) and MOHA are involved in efforts to disseminate the new \nbudgeting, reporting, and supervision requirements of the new regulatory regime, particularly in \nrelation  to  government  regulations  58/2005  and  39/2007  and  MOHA  regulations  13/2006  and \n59/2007,  which  provide  the  framework  for  modern  and  consistent  decentralized  budget  and \nfinancial  management.  For  instance,  in  2007  MOHA  conducted  specialized  PFM  courses  for \nabout  100  central  government  officials  and  400  regional  government  officials.  MOF  also \nundertakes  training  for  decentralized  financial  officials  nationwide,  mainly  through  the  regional \nuniversities.  In  2007,  it  conducted  training  in  eight  different  locations  for  about  1,528  regional \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 5 \n\n69 \n\nin \n\ntrained \n\nofficials.  Under  subprogram  2  a  considerably  expanded  scope  for  training  and  professional \ndevelopment of regional finance officials is planned, with commitments for considerably higher \nfunding than in recent times from both MOHA and MOF.  \n \nAdditionally, MOF and MOHA with funding from the LGFGR 1 project loan are involved \n50. \nin the development of new computerized financial management information systems (FMIS) to \nsupport  planning,  budgeting,  budget  execution,  reporting,  and  auditing  in  171  regional \ngovernments  to  start  with,  and  possibly  other  regional  governments  later  on.  About  9,642 \nthis  major \nfinance  and  management  officials  will  be \nregional  government \ncapacity-building  project.  Moreover,  the  Sustainable  Capacity  Building  for  Decentralization \n(SCBD)  project  funded  by  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  continues  to  provide  some  40 \nparticipating  regional  governments  with  general  management  training  and  support.  Because \nthese  two  ADB  project  loans  are  both  still  disbursing,  the  Government  has  decided  not  to \npursue a further project loan under subprogram 1 of LGFGR 2. But the possibility of such a loan \nunder subprogram 2 has not been ruled out, especially if the current project support continues \nto make good progress. Other development partners with involvement in fiscal decentralization \nmatters are directing most of their efforts at capacity building in one form or another (systems, \nhuman resources, etc.) in regional governments, in some cases (with ADB support) through the \nleadership  of  MOF,  MOHA,  and  BPK  (see  Appendix  4).  Improving  capacity  for  decentralized \nplanning,  budgeting  and  financial  management  remains  a  core  focus  of  subprograms  1  and  2 \nand  will  require  the  application  of  considerable  resources  from  all  levels  of  government  and \ndevelopment  partners  over  an  extended  period  of  time.  Under  Indonesia\u2019s  capacity-building \nframework,  central  ministries  and  agencies  must  provide  leadership  and  facilitation  but  the \nregional  governments  themselves  must  take  ultimate  responsibility  for  improving  their  own \ncapacity. There is still scope for development partners to support both centrally led efforts but \nalso  increasingly  to  engage  directly  with  individual  regional  governments  or  groups  of \ngovernments. \n \n\n \n\n\f70 \n \n\nAppendix 6 \n\nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY  \n \n\nIndonesia: Second Local Government Finance and Governance Reform Program Cluster (LGFGR 2) \n \n\nProgram Loan \n\nPolicy-Based \n\n \n\n \n\nDepartment/ \nDivision: \n\n \n\nSoutheast Asia Department \nGovernance, Finance, and \nTrade Division \n \n\nI. \n\nPOVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\nA. Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \nThe Government\u2019s medium-term development plan (Rencana Pembangunan Jangka Menengah, or RPJM) looks forward to \nhalving  the  percentage  of  those  below  the  poverty  line  to  8.2%  by  2009  through  programs  to  improve  food  security,  water \nsupply  and  sanitation,  access  to  basic  health  and  education  services,  and  shelter.  The  RPJM  also  projects  an  increase  in \nschool enrollment rates, especially in the 9-year mandatory basic education program, to over 99% in 2009, with improvements \nin the quality of education. It projects a significant increase in enrollment in secondary and tertiary education as well, and a \nreduction in illiteracy to 5%. At the same time, income inequality has increased over time, suggesting that the cost of reducing \npoverty  may  have  increased.  Addressing  poverty  reduction  Indirectly,  the  Second  Local  Government  Finance  and \nGovernance Reform Program (LGFGR 2)  will help the regional governments deliver basic public services more efficiently and \neffectively to their constituents by making the release of fiscal transfers and shared revenues more equitable, predictable, and \ntransparent.  LGFGR  2  also  supports  improvements  in  service  delivery  mechanisms  through  the  provision  of  financing  and \nperformance monitoring. In addition, it will strengthen the capacity of regional governments to generate their own revenues, \nand improve accountability. Support for the implementation of fiscal decentralization reforms will further contribute indirectly to \npoverty reduction by improving the investment climate and reducing bottlenecks in regional infrastructure development. There \nwill also be short-term employment generation through enhanced programs of public works. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                  Targeting Classification:  General intervention \n1. Key Issues  \n \nBetter  economic  growth  over  the  last  5  years  has  raised  living  standards  and  reduced  the  poverty  headcount  ratio  in \nIndonesia.  But,  given  the  persistence  of  poverty  in  the  last  5  years,  the  RPJM  poverty  target  is  unlikely  to  be  met.  The \nincrease  in  income  inequality  over  time  also  suggests  that  it  may  cost  more  to  reduce  poverty.  With  the  country  so \ngeographically diverse, reducing poverty requires different strategies and efforts in different regions. Per capita income in the \nrichest  province  is  more  than  20  times  that  of  the  poorest  province.  Poverty  indicators  also  show  large  regional  disparities: \npoverty incidence is lowest in Jakarta (4.6%) and highest (40%) in Papua. Access to opportunities is far from equal, as shown \nin the table below. The poor at the bottom rungs of income distribution have fewer job opportunities than the nonpoor. While \nthe health insurance program for the poor (Askeskin) has given the poor easier access to basic health services, better health \nservices  largely  benefit  those  at  the  top  end  of  the  income  distribution  scale.  Basic  infrastructure  services,  particularly \nelectricity and clean drinking water, are not equally shared. \n \nC. Poverty Impact Analysis for Policy-Based Lending  \nDecentralization  has  been  advocated  as  an  important  policy  tool  to  broaden  citizen  participation  and  improve  local \ngovernance, making regional governments more responsive and more likely to develop policies and programs that meet local \nneeds.  Bottom-up  poverty  reduction  is  thereby  promoted.  International  experiencea  suggests  that  the  link  between \ndecentralization and poverty reduction is not always clear. In some of the poorest countries characterized by weak institutions \nand  political  conflicts,  decentralization  may  actually  worsen  matters.  The  poverty  impact  of  decentralization  appears  to \ndepend less on the physical country setting, for example, a country\u2019s size or quality of infrastructure, than on the capacity and \nwillingness  of  policy  makers  to  ensure  pro-poor  devolution.  If  the  central  Government  lacks  the  capacity  to  fulfill  its  basic \nfunctions, decentralization could be counterproductive. However, if the central Government provides the necessary leadership \nand  is  committed  to  devolving  power  to  lower  tiers  of  government,  decentralization  could  be  a  powerful  tool  for  poverty \nreduction, better representation for the poor, and better targeting of service delivery.  \n \nOverall,  poverty  in  Indonesia  has  declined  only  moderately  in  the  past  few  years  (see  table).  Factors  affecting  the  poverty \nincidence are complex. At the macro level, stronger economic growth and falling inflation in the past few years have provided \nessential  underpinning  for  poverty  reduction.  At  a  more  micro  level,  large  increases  in  the  prices  of  rice  and  other \ncommodities that are major items of expenditure in the budget of the poor have at times more than reversed the poverty gains \nfrom economic growth. The number of people living below the poverty line declined from 36.2 million in 2004 to 35.1 million in \n2005. But higher inflation and a significant increase in the prices of rice and fuel reversed the trend in 2006. Falling inflation, \ntogether  with  the  Government\u2019s  conditional  cash  transfer  program  for  the  poor  designed  as  compensation  for  the  fuel  price \nincreases,  helped  bring  overall  poverty  back  toward  2004  levels  in  2007.  However,  poverty  incidence  in  the  urban  areas \nincreased during the same period.  \n\n \n\n\fPoverty, Inequality, and Regional Autonomy \n\n2001 \n\n2004 \n\n2005 \n\nItem \nPoverty (million) a \nHeadcount, Rural \nHeadcount, Urban \nTotal \n\n(percentage of population) \n\n \n22.7 \n12.4 \n35.1 \n16.0 \nInequality a \n \n34.9 \nGini Index \nRegional Equality b \n \n0.84 \nCoefficient of Correlation between DAU and Poverty \nCoefficient of Correlation between DAK and Poverty \n(0.12) \n\u2014 = not available, DAK = specific allocation fund, DAU = general allocation fund. \na Central Bureau of Statistics (BPS). \nb Based on budget data for 2005\u20132008. \nSources: World Bank and Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n \n24.8 \n11.4 \n36.2 \n16.7 \n \n34.7 \n \n\u2014 \n\u2014 \n\n \n29.3 \n8.6 \n37.9 \n18.4 \n \n32.1 \n \n\u2014 \n\u2014 \n\nAppendix 6 \n\n71 \n\n2006 \n\n2007 \n\n \n24.8 \n14.5 \n39.3 \n17.8 \n \n35.4 \n \n0.8 \n0.15 \n\n2008 \n \n\u2014 \n\u2014 \n\u2014 \n\u2014 \n \n\u2014 \n \n0.78 \n0.15 \n\n \n23.6 \n13.6 \n37.2 \n16.6 \n \n37.6 \n \n0.79 \n0.09 \n\n \nDecentralization has significantly increased the fiscal resources transferred to the regions. The largest transfer is the general \nallocation  fund  (Dana  Alokasi  Umum,  or  DAU),  which  accounts  for  about  for  about  62%  of  local  government  revenues  and \n20% of provincial government revenues. Regional fiscal equalization relies heavily on the DAU and its allocation appears to \nbe  highly  correlated  with  the  poverty  headcount  ratio.  However,  poverty  reduction  across  regions  is  very  uneven.  In  2002\u2013\n2007, poverty reduction in most provinces was moderate to significant. Despite large transfers from the central Government, \npoverty  in  the  one  of  the  poorest  provinces  (Papua)  was  stagnant  during  the  period,  whereas  poverty  in  Jakarta  increased \nfrom 3.4% in 2004 to 4.6% in 2007.  \n \n\nII. \n\nSOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\nA.

The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  has \nbeen  actively  supporting,  through  many  TA  projects,  the  implementation  of  related  regional \ngovernment  reforms  in  capacity  development,  local  government  financing,  public  financial \nmanagement, service delivery, performance measurement, and other areas. This TA will help fill \nthe remaining gaps and will be specifically targeted at medium-term reform areas. \n\nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n2. \nThe  TA  will  strive  to  enhance  management  and  coordination  in  the  implementation  of \nfiscal  decentralization,  improve  the  intergovernmental  fiscal  system,  develop  better  incentive \nsystems for service delivery, and reduce regional governments\u2019 dependency on fiscal transfers. \nThe  expected  outcome  is  improved  delivery  of  services  for  the  general  welfare  of  the \ncommunities and enhanced accountability of regional governments.  \n\nC. \n\nOutputs \n\n3. \nNational  Action  Plan  for  Fiscal  Decentralization  (NAPFD)  2010\u20132014.  This  will \nprovide  a  strong  legal  and  management  framework  for  the  long-term  implementation  of  fiscal \ndecentralization  and  ensure  effective  continuation  of  the  decentralization  agenda.  This \ncomponent will include the following activities:  \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nsupporting  the  National  Development  Planning  Agency  (Badan  Perencanaan \nPembangunan  Nasional,  or  BAPPENAS)  in  developing  NAPFD  2010\u20132014, \nsetting  out  the  Government\u2019s  objectives,  strategies,  and  policy  actions  in  fiscal \ndecentralization  over  the  next  5-year  development  period.  This  activity  will  be \ncoordinated closely with that of the advisory team that is now developing the draft \nof a grand strategy for fiscal decentralization under the leadership of the Ministry \nof Finance (MOF); \nassisting  BAPPENAS  in  conducting  background  studies  in  cooperation  with \nnational reputable research institutions to support the preparation of the NAPFD; \nsupporting  the  conduct  of  seminars  for  key  stakeholders  from  the  central  and \nregional governments to discuss the NAPFD draft; and \nsupporting BAPPENAS in developing the national medium-term development plan \n(Rencana Pembangunan Jangka Menengah, or RPJM) 2010\u20132014 in the area of \nfiscal decentralization, with the help of outputs developed under NAPFD. \n\n4. \nFiscal Decentralization Modeling and Database in MOF. This component will enhance \nthe equalizing effects of the general allocation fund (Dana Alokasi Umum, or DAU) and introduce \nincentives to reduce the regional governments\u2019 wage bill, thereby freeing up more resources for \nhigher-priority spending. This component will involve the following activities: \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 8 \n\n75 \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nreviewing the model now used to allocate DAU and the database used to support \nthe calibration of the model; \nreviewing the definition of fiscal capacity and expenditure needs used to compute \nthe  fiscal  gap  And,  as better  data  become  available,  identifying  the  possibility  of \nfurther  refining  the  measurement  of  if  fiscal  capacity  and  expenditure  needs  to \nreflect regional disparities; \ndeveloping  a  new  model  and  conducting  simulations  to  identify  options  and \neffects of delinking the regional government wage bill from DAU allocations; \nassisting MOF in conducting analytical studies on the regional government wage \nbill in cooperation with a reputable national institution; and \nfacilitating dialogue among fiscal decentralization experts on the options identified \nand developing a strategy for securing buy-in from various stakeholders.  \n\n \n5. \nForward  Estimates  for  Major  Transfers  and  Implementation.  The  activities  in  this \ncomponent  will  reduce  uncertainties  in  future  transfers  and  shared  revenue  and  facilitate  the \nintroduction of a medium-term expenditure framework (MTEF) at the regional level as stated in \nthe 2008 budget. The central Government introduced MTEF in 2008. The following activities will \nbe undertaken in this component: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nsupporting MOF in designing forward estimates for major transfers and other large \nshared revenue flows and incorporating these estimates into budget documents; \nand \nsupporting  MOF  in  developing  projections  of  variables  affecting  DAU  allocations \nand shared revenue flows. \n\n \n6. \nDAK Design and Monitoring. The activities in this component will improve the allocation \nof  the  general  allocation  fund  (Dana  Alokasi  Khusus,  or  DAK)  as  it  will  be  based  on  clear \nprinciples  and  a  smaller  set  of  objectives.  Over  the  medium  term,  the  new  DAK  design  and \nmonitoring  mechanism  will  address  concerns  about  the  diluted  impact  of  DAK,  as  the  fund  is \nbeing  used  in  a  growing  number  of  sectors  by  an  increasing  number  of  regional  governments. \nThis component will involve the following activities: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nsupporting MOF in updating and preparing DAK guidelines to improve the impact \nof  the  fund  in  achieving  national  priorities;  identifying  the  most  desirable  way  of \nincorporating  an  element  of  regional  government  performance  in  allocation \nformulas; \nassisting  MOF  in  strengthening  the  DAK  monitoring  and  evaluation  system  and \nprepare its operational framework; \nsupporting  MOF  in  preparing  the  required  government  or  MOF  regulations  and \ndisseminating these to the regions; and \nsupporting the implementation of the operational framework for DAK and training \nstakeholders in its use.  \n\n \n7. \nPilot-Testing  of  Incentive-  and  Sanction-Linked  Transfers.  This  component  will \nimprove the central Government\u2019s ability to enforce appropriate intergovernmental mechanisms, \nsupport  the  enhancement  of  regional  government  capacity,  and  strengthen  local  governance. \nIncentive-  and  sanction-linked  transfers  will  provide  an  efficient  mechanism  for  promoting  the \nregional governments\u2019 participation in achieving national development priorities and in speeding \nup decentralization reforms. This component will have the following activities: \n \n\n \n\n\f76 \n \n\nAppendix 8 \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nsupporting  MOF  in  finalizing  the  policy  design  for  incentives  and  sanctions  for \ntransfers  based  on  the  MOF  policy  paper  completed  under  subprogram  1  of \nLGFGR 2; \nassisting  MOF  in  developing  guidelines  and  implementing  procedures  for \nfurthering  the  introduction  of  incentive-  and  sanction-based  transfers  on  a  pilot \nbasis; and \nsupporting \nstakeholders to implement and roll out the system of incentives and sanctions. \n\nfacilitating  consultations  and \n\nfurther  studies  and \n\ntraining  of \n\n \n8.  \nDevolution of Property Tax to the Regions. This will improve the revenue autonomy of \nregional  governments  and  make  them  less  dependent  on  fiscal  transfers  from  the  central \nGovernment. This component will entail the following activities: \n \n\nsupporting  MOF  in  disseminating  the  amendments  to  law  34/2000  (on  regional \ntaxes  and  charges)  and  facilitating  discussion  on  the  design  for  the  gradual \ndevolution of the property tax; \nassisting MOF in developing guidelines for the decentralization of the property tax; \nand \nsupporting  MOF  during  the  early  stages  of  devolution  of  the  property  tax  with \nmonitoring and training and required studies. \n\n \n9.  \nPlanning  for  Decentralized  Capacity  Building.  This  component  will  improve  the \ncoordination of human resource capacity building, essential in implementing the many new legal \nframeworks and regulations recently passed in the areas of public financial management (PFM) \nand certification schemes. In addition, the implementation progress of subprogram 2 triggers will \nbe monitored. The following activities will be carried out in this component: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nsupporting  MOF,  BAPPENAS,  and  the  Ministry  of  Home  Affairs  (MOHA)  in \nproviding training and capacity building to improve the implementation of PFM in \nthe region; \nassisting  MOF  in  developing  and  implementing  schemes  for  functional  position \ncertification for local finance officials; and \ntraining local finance officials in functional positions.  \n\nD. \n\nCost and Financing \n\nin \n\n10. \nThe TA is estimated to cost a total of $1.8 million, $1.5 million of which will be financed \nby  ADB  with  a  grant  from  the  Technical  Assistance  Special  Fund.
