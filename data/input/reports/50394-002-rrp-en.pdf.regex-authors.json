THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nthe Kingdom of Cambodia for the Skills for Competitiveness Project. \n \n2.  The proposed project will enhance the skills and competitiveness of Cambodia\u2019s industrial \nsector labor force. It will develop human resources to work as skilled workforce in four priority \nsectors: manufacturing, construction, electricity, and electronics. The project will help transform \nfive selected technical training institutes (TTIs) into leading technical and vocational education \nand training (TVET) institutes in Cambodia to produce high-quality technicians in priority sectors \nand to respond to changing technology and industry needs. The project will also strengthen \nindustry\u2019s role and engagement in skills development, focusing on upskilling and reskilling of \nexisting workers. Industry and TTIs will forge partnership agreements to promote work-based \nlearning (WBL) programs and expand the skills development fund (SDF) as an innovative TVET \nfinancing mechanism. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n3.  Broad context. Cambodia is one of the fastest-growing economies in the world, with an \naverage growth rate of 7.1% during 2011\u20132017. To achieve this, the country has embraced the \n\u201cFactory Asia\u201d model of economic growth, deploying a large supply of inexpensive low-skilled \nlabor to manufacture simple products for export, particularly garments and footwear. However, \ndespite a favorable economic growth forecast, there are signs of medium-term downside risks. \nFor example, the minimum wage in the garment sector has more than doubled from $80 a month \nin 2013 to $182 a month in 2019, while labor productivity has not improved. Cambodia\u2019s ranking \nin the Global Competitiveness Report 2018 remained low (110th out of 140 economies) because \nof difficulties finding skilled employees.1 The growth model of attracting foreign direct investment \nfor labor cost advantage is getting diluted. The Government of Cambodia aims to diversify and \nmodernize industries from labor-intensive to skills-driven ones to sustain economic growth, as laid \nout in its Industry Development Policy (IDP), 2015\u20132025. 2 As such, it has prioritized reform of its \nTVET system to equip its future and current workforce with the required skills to make the \ntransition from low-skilled jobs to higher-skilled jobs. \n \n4.  Labor force. On average, Cambodia adds 200,000 persons to its labor force annually.3 \nWhile the agriculture sector contributed 25.3% to annual gross domestic product (GDP) and \naccounted for 37% of total employment in 2017, the industry sector (32.8% of GDP and 26% of \nemployment in 2017) and the services sector (32.8% of GDP and 37% of employment in 2017) \nhave been the main sources of job growth since 2012. This has been driven by an expansion in \nmanufacturing, tourism, and construction. Only 30% of Cambodia\u2019s working age population of \n10.4 million completed lower secondary education (up to grade 9). Of this cohort, only 6.6% \ncompleted post-secondary education (beyond upper secondary education or grade 12).4 \n                                                \n1  World Economic Forum. The Global Competitiveness Report 2018. Geneva. \n2  Government of Cambodia. 2015. Industrial Development Policy, 2015\u20132025. Phnom Penh. \n3  Cambodia\u2019s working age population (ages 15\u201364) grew by an average of 2.4% per annum compared with its general \npopulation, which grew by 1.9% per annum during 2007\u20132015. The working age population increased from 8.3 million \nin 2007 to 10.4 million in 2017 (51% of which are women). \n4  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) supports Cambodia in improving its educational attainment through a series of \nloans aimed at strengthening upper secondary education outcomes. ADB. Cambodia: Upper Secondary Education \n \n ", "2 \n5.  Skills shortage and skills gap. The low skill base of Cambodia poses barriers for the \ncountry to diversify and modernize its industries, move up global value chains, and increase \ncompetitiveness.  Industries  face  skills  gaps  and  shortages,  particularly  in  machining, \nmechatronics in the manufacturing and construction sectors, and electrical technology. A 2017 \nemployer survey identified technicians and associate professionals in these sectors as the most \ndifficult positions to fill.5 Significant skills gaps and shortages result from low education attainment, \nweak industry relevance of training (especially at the post-secondary diploma level), and lack of \nindustry-specific medium-term skills demand planning. The Ministry of Labour and Vocational \nTraining (MLVT) in 2018 established four sector skills councils (SSCs) comprising representatives \nfrom industry associations in manufacturing, construction, auto mechanics, and electrical works. \nThe SSCs are expected to serve as a platform for TTIs and industry to jointly identify skills gaps \nand shortages in each industry and plan skills trainings. However, as the MLVT lacks the capacity \nto engage industry in TVET, SSCs are yet to be effective. Industry representatives have little \nincentive to invest time and effort to engage with MLVT and TTIs. \n \n6.  Lack of industry-relevant diploma-level technical and vocational education and \ntraining programs. There are 56 public TTIs, of which only 23 TTIs under the MLVT and 4 \ninstitutes under Ministry of Education, Youth and Sport (MoEYS) offer post-secondary diploma-\nlevel TVET programs. However, most of the diploma programs are for service sector jobs, such \nas business administration and information and communication technology. There is a need to \nexpand  and  strengthen  diploma-level  TVET  programs  catering  to  industry  sector  jobs  by \nupgrading training facilities and equipment in the TTIs, and updating curricula to meet industry \nneeds. Upgrading TTI trainers\u2019 technical and pedagogical skills with industry experience will be \nvital. TVET graduates are less prepared for the world of work and lack necessary foundation skills \n(such as science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) and industry-specific technical \nskills.  Female  graduates  in  diploma-  level  TVET  programs  are  particularly  low,  such  as \nconstruction (4%) and electricity (6%).6 \n \n7.  Lack of opportunities for upskilling and reskilling current workers. Most small and \nmedium-sized enterprises do not have the capacity to provide any training to their employees.7 \nLarge employers, mostly foreign firms in special economic zones, invest in some in-house, on-\nthe-job  training,  but  without  any  linkages  with  TTIs.  While  some  TTIs  have  entered  into \npartnerships  with  industry,  there  is  no  system  to  expand  work-based  continuous  learning \nopportunities for upskilling current workers. Formal training opportunities are limited to only those \nwho possess at least lower secondary education graduation certificates. Thus, many current \nworkers are trapped in low-wage and low-skill jobs. \n \n8.  Inadequate financing to the technical and vocational education and training sector. \nThe current level of public TVET financing is insufficient and not responsive to labor market needs. \nIn 2018, the MLVT budget was around 6% of the total national budget for education and training. \nAbout 80% of the budget allocated for TVET is used for recurrent expenditures, particularly \n                                                \nSector Development Program; and ADB.

Very little remains for investment in TVET facilities and training \nequipment,  and  in  building  partnerships  with  industry  for  work-based  continuous  learning \nprograms. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) conducted a feasibility study in 2017 to explore \noptions and implementation strategies for innovative TVET financing mechanisms to increase the \nprivate  sector\u2019s  investments.8  Based  on  the  study\u2019s  recommendations,  the  government \nestablished a pilot SDF in the Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF) to foster engagements \nand cost sharing of training programs with industry.9 The pilot SDF is an industry demand-driven \nworkforce development financing mechanism that encourages joint financing with industry, with \nfocus on upskilling and reskilling current workers. \n \n9.   Government strategy for skills development. The IDP; the Rectangular Strategy \nPhase IV;10 and the National TVET Policy, 2017\u20132025 reaffirm the government\u2019s commitment to \nskills development as a means of facilitating inclusive growth. The IDP has set specific targets to \nincrease the share of the industry sector in GDP through increased growth of the manufacturing \nsector (20% by 2025). The government aims to develop a comprehensive, long-term, multisector \npolicy  framework  to  guide  industrial  development,  employment  generation,  and  skills \ndevelopment. \n \n10.  The  MLVT,  MoEYS,  and  MEF  have  consulted  with  representatives  of  industry  and \nemployer associations, the Cambodia Productivity Committee, and other stakeholders to identify \npriority sectors for skills development in achieving IDP objectives. Four sectors were identified: (i) \nmanufacturing\u2014focusing on machining, mechatronics, and agro-processing; (ii) construction; (iii) \nelectricity; and (iv) electronics. These were prioritized based on analyses of labor market trends, \neconomic factors, skills shortages and skills gaps, national policies such as the IDP, and industry \nassociations\u2019 demand. \n \n11.  ADB engagement in technical and vocational education and training. ADB has \nsupported education and TVET in Cambodia since 2001 and is the leading development partner \nin the sector. Earlier TVET support focused on improving nonformal and entry-level short-term \nprograms. This contributed to increased employment opportunities for low- and semiskilled labor, \nmostly in the agriculture sector. The ongoing TVET Sector Development Program11 supports \nsecondary-level TVET (certificate level or Cambodia Qualifications Framework [CQF] levels 2\u2013\n4),12 and reforms in assessment and certification systems. It has also supported the MLVT to \nestablish SSCs. The project builds on these previous and ongoing ADB-financed TVET projects \nand supports the IDP goals by producing high-quality technicians (diploma level or CQF level 5) \nin the four priority industry sectors. It complements the TVET Sector Development Program in \nsupporting  TVET  reforms  in  close  coordination  with  SSCs,  industry  associations,  and \ndevelopment partners.13 \n \n                                                \n8  ADB.

The CQF for TVET has eight levels starting with a \nvocational certificate (level 1); TVET certificates (levels 2\u20134), which are equivalent to upper secondary school or \ngrades 10\u201312; diploma (level 5) equivalent to postsecondary or grade 12 completion; bachelor\u2019s degree (level 6); \nmaster\u2019s degree (level 7); and doctorate degree (level 8). \n13 Development Coordination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "4 \n12.  Lessons learned. The project design incorporates lessons learned from earlier projects \nand ensures its transitions to more industry demand driven TVET project. First, there should be \na clear incentive mechanism and continuous trust-building dialogues between the government \nand industry to enhance demand-driven skills development. SSCs thus need to be strengthened \nwith  appropriate  incentives  to  bridge  the  gap  between  government  agencies,  TTIs,  and \nemployers. Second, TVET financing mechanism should be diversified and strengthened to \nincrease the private sector\u2019s contributions to skills development. Third, the selected TTIs should \nnot be passive beneficiaries of project activities and should commit to achieve key performance \nindicators at the institute level. This assures sustainability of results beyond project completion. \n \n13.  Value added by ADB assistance. ADB\u2019s added value comes from several key innovative \nfeatures: (i) expanding toward institutionalizing SDF as an innovative TVET financing mechanism, \n(ii) piloting WBL programs through partnership arrangements with industry for upskilling and \nreskilling of current workers, (iii) enhancing cross-sectoral and development synergies in skills \ndevelopment in the agro-industry14 and electricity sectors, (iv) strengthening industry linkages by \nengaging the Cambodian Federation of Employers and Business Association (CAMFEBA) to \nreflect industry\u2019s demands,15 (v) incorporating key emerging issues such as climate change in the \nupgraded TVET curricula, and (vi) developing a long-term skills development road map.

Output 1 will improve the quality \nand industry relevance of the selected TTIs by (i) upgrading 16 new training facilities (workshops, \nlaboratories,  classrooms,  and  dormitories)  with  gender-sensitive  and  energy-saving  design \nfeatures (separate dormitory floors and toilets for women and men, accessible design features for \ndisabled students); (ii) providing advanced, industry-grade training equipment; (iii) upgrading \ndiploma-level competency-based curricula and trainers\u2019 capacities in partnership with industry; \nand (iv) providing merit-based stipends to selected diploma students. The five TTIs were selected \nthrough a series of consultations with industries and the government, and will serve as change \nagents.18 The selection considered strategic locations of TTIs near to economic corridors and \nspecial economic zones in the country and the capacity of TTIs to act as change agents. Each \nTTI has identified its priority programs based on current and future local market needs, and has \ncommitted to achieve agreed key performance indicators to sustain project outputs.19 \n \n16.  Output 2: Work-based learning programs with industry partnerships promoted.20 \nOutput 2 will provide upskilling and reskilling opportunities for existing workers to address skills \ngaps and skills shortage in industries. It will develop the capacity of SSCs and the five selected \nTTIs to identify training needs, develop needs-responsive trainings, and deliver WBL programs \neffectively to upgrade the skills of existing workers. WBL programs will also meet the continuing \ndemand from industries to train workers\u2019 soft skills such as teamwork and communication. The \nselected TTI trainers and industry-liaison unit staff will be trained to implement at least 18 WBL \nprograms in partnership with industries, which will provide WBL opportunities to at least 360 \nexisting workers. In addition, the selected TTIs will develop at least 20 WBL proposals to access \nto  the  pilot  SDF  (output  3).  ADB,  through  Agence  Fran\u00e7aise  de  D\u00e9veloppement  (AFD) \ncofinancing, will engage CAMFEBA to fully operationalize SSCs by mobilizing a coordinator and \nproviding financial incentives to industry representatives for providing expertise for the project. \nThis includes providing advice to the MLVT, MEF, and TTIs on future industry and market trends, \nand technical expertise to the MEF to evaluate proposals submitted to the pilot SDF. \n \n17.  Output 3: Innovative technical and vocational education and training financing \nmechanisms expanded. Output 3 will expand the pilot SDF, which is currently managed by the \nMEF\u2019s Department of Macroeconomic and Fiscal Policy (DMFP). It is an innovative model in \nCambodia to increase and incentivize industry\u2019s investments in skills development (para. 8). The \ngovernment has allocated $5 million from the national budget for the pilot SDF, with ADB\u2019s \ntechnical assistance to establish the governance structure, operational mechanism, and financial \nmanagement. Implementation arrangements for the pilot SDF are set forth in the SDF project \nadministration manual (PAM) and the SDF financial management manual.21 The project will (i) \nfinance training proposals to be funded by the pilot SDF, which provide training opportunities for \nat least 3,500 persons in the labor force (of which at least 25% are female); (ii) develop capacity \nof the MEF\u2019s DMFP to strengthen its management of the pilot SDF; and (iii) provide support for \nthe establishment of a new SDF agency by producing key policy study and knowledge products, \n                                                \n18 The five TTIs are Battambang Institute of Technology, Institute of Technology of Cambodia (ITC), National \nPolytechnic Institute of Angkor, National Technical Training Institute for TVET Park, and Regional Polytechnic \nInstitute Techo Sen Svay Rieng. \n19 Key performance indicators are included in the Project Administration Manual (PAM) (accessible from the list of \nlinked documents in Appendix 2). \n20 WBL programs under the project include delivery of training in the workplace by training providers, center-based \nspecialized training, or a combination of both. The program may be on technical or soft skills, and may be intensive \nfull-time short courses or delivered part-time, as may be agreed in the partnership agreement. \n21 PAM (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2), Annex 3. \n \n ", "6 \nwhich include a long-term skills development road map.

DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Economic and Financial \n23.  Economic analysis. The project\u2019s economic internal rate of return is estimated at 9.7%, \nwhich is above the minimum required threshold for ADB social sector projects (6%). This indicates \nthat the project is economically viable or that the value of the expected economic benefits from \nthe project is above the opportunity cost of the required investment. The principal benefits \nconsidered in the analysis are the likely incremental wages to be earned by additional graduates \ntrained under the project. Sensitivity analysis indicates that the project\u2019s economic internal rate of \nreturn is sensitive to possible changes in employment rate among training graduates as well as \nchanges in training participation and completion rates. \n \n24.  Financial sustainability. The project will contribute additional funds to raise the annual \ngovernment expenditure on TVET. In 2018, of the $54 million total budget allocated to the MLVT, \nover one-third ($18.7 million) was allocated to the DGTVET. To fully cover the project\u2019s operation \nand maintenance costs, the DGTVET requires about $1.4 million per year (9.2% of its recurrent \nbudget in 2018) from 2024 to 2028, and about $1.8 million per year (12.3% of its recurrent budget \nin 2018) from 2029 onwards. This requires the DGTVET\u2019s recurrent budget to grow by at least \n2.38% per year starting in 2019. This is lower than the expected  7% growth rate for the \nCambodian economy, and the DGTVET\u2019s recurrent budget, indicating that the project is financially \nsustainable. \n \nB.  Governance \n25.  Financial management. The financial management assessment  concluded that the \noverall pre-mitigation financial management risk for the project as well as for the executing agency \nand each implementing agency is substantial. The major risks involve the limited capacity of \nMLVT, DGTVET, ITC, and DMFP staff in financial management, including financial reporting. The \nmitigation measures include (i) appointing qualified counterpart staff for the project management \nunit (PMU) and implementing agencies, (ii) recruiting three financial management consultants to \nsupport each implementing agency, (iii) providing training and financial management information \nsystems software, and (iv) continuing to develop operational systems for the pilot SDF. \n \n26.  Procurement. The procurement capacity assessment concluded that the overall risk \nrating is medium. All procurement and recruitment of consultants will be undertaken by the \nrespective implementing agencies through procurement committees. To strengthen procurement \ncapacity, ADB and the project implementation consultants will provide in-country support and \ncarry out training for PMU staff and the implementing agencies. ADB will mobilize a start-up \nprocurement consultant to support advance actions for civil  works and consulting services \nprocurement. In addition, three procurement consultants will strengthen the capacity of each \nimplementing  agency  to  ensure  compliance,  quality,  and  timely  procurement  activities. \nProcurement of goods and works, and recruitment of consulting services will be undertaken \nfollowing the ADB Procurement Policy and Procurement Regulations for ADB Borrowers (2017, \nas  amended  from  time  to  time).  As  ADB  will  partially  administer  the  AFD  loan,  universal \nprocurement will be applied. \n \n27.  Anticorruption. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained \n ", "9 \nto  and  discussed  with  the  government  and  MLVT.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and \nsupplementary measures are described in the PAM (footnote 19). \n \nC.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n28.  The project is categorized as effective gender mainstreaming and designed to help reduce \ngender inequality in accessing TVET and increase the number of female skilled workers in \nnontraditional sectors. Most of the female students in TVET are enrolled in courses on accounting, \nfinance and banking, and information and communication technology. In 2018, an estimated 19% \nof the students and only 10% of the trainers in the priority sector technical courses in the selected \nTTIs were women. The project will promote enrollment of female students to diploma-level TVET \nand capacity building of female trainers in teaching and management positions. The gender action \nplan includes measures to attract more women to acquire industry-relevant skills and gain \nemployment into male-dominated sectors. The project will upgrade facilities in the selected TTIs \nwith  gender-sensitive  design,  develop  gender-sensitive  diploma  modules  and  training,  and \nprovide merit-based stipends to female students. Partnerships between the selected TTIs and \nindustries to promote female technicians and adopt gender-inclusive policies for hiring female \nstudents, workers, and trainers will be established. \n \nD.  Safeguards \n29.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project\u2019s safeguard \ncategories are as follows.24 \n \n30.  Environment  (category  B).  An  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE)  and  an \nenvironmental management plan (EMP) have been prepared covering civil works at TTIs. The \ndraft IEE and EMP were disclosed on ADB\u2019s website. The final IEE and EMP will be disclosed \nfollowing  detailed  designs. The  improvements proposed  through the  project  will  not cause \nsignificant adverse environmental impacts. The potential impacts associated with construction \nand demolition of buildings include community and occupational health and safety hazards, \nincreased noise and dust levels, waste generation and disposal, and traffic congestion. These \nimpacts can be mitigated through effective implementation of mitigation and monitoring measures, \nas specified in the EMP, and good construction site management practice. The PMU and project \nimplementation units will designate counterpart safeguards staff to monitor compliance of the \ncontractors with the EMP, relevant regulations of the government, and ADB policies, with the \nsupport of one national safeguards consultant. The Ministry of Environment has approved building \ndesigns. Project-related complaints will be addressed through a grievance redress mechanism. \n \n31.  Involuntary resettlement (category C). Due diligence confirmed that all selected TTIs \nare existing operational education facilities located on state-owned land plots and will not require \nacquisition of additional land and/or involuntary resettlement. The due diligence report was disclosed \non the ADB website. \n \n32.  Indigenous peoples (category C). Due diligence confirmed that the project is not \nexpected to have any impact on indigenous people, as it is not being implemented in provinces \nwith indigenous communities. \n \n                                                \n24 ADB.

ASSURANCES \n \n34.  The government and MLVT have assured ADB that implementation of the project shall \nconform to all applicable ADB policies, including those concerning anticorruption measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, financial management, and disbursement \nas described in detail in the PAM and loan documents. The government and MLVT have agreed \nwith ADB on certain covenants for the project, which are set forth in the draft loan agreement. \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n35.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve the loan of $60,000,000 \nto the Kingdom of Cambodia for the Skills for Competitiveness Project, from ADB\u2019s ordinary \ncapital resources, in concessional terms, with an interest charge at the rate of 1% per year during \nthe grace period and 1.5% per year thereafter; for a term of 32 years, including a grace period of \n8 years; and such other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set \nforth in the draft loan agreement presented to the Board. \nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n31 May 2019 \n                                                \n25 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "Appendix 1  11 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nImpact the Project is Aligned with \nCambodia\u2019s industrial structure is modernized and transformed from labor intensive to skills driven by 2025 \n(Industrial Development Policy, 2015\u20132025)a  \nPerformance Indicators with  Data Sources and  Risks \nResults Chain   Targets and Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms   \nOutcome  By 2025:       \nSkills and competitiveness  a.
