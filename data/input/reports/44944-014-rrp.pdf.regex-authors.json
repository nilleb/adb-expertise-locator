I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nloan of up to $125 million to Uz-Kor Gas Chemical LLC; and (ii) a political risk guarantee (PRG) \nof up to $275 million for commercial lenders to Uz-Kor Gas Chemical LLC for the Surgil Natural \nGas Chemicals Project.1 \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Project Identification and Description \n1.  Project Identification \n2.  The project\u2019s transaction advisor, ING Bank N.V., London branch (ING), approached the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) in July 2010 to participate as an anchor lender and catalyze \ncommercial banks to finance the Surgil Gas Chemicals Project. ING\u2019s objective was to structure \nthe most commercially attractive deal for commercial launch by reaching a negotiated term sheet \nwith ADB and finalizing the technical, commercial, and environmental and social due diligence \npackages  based  on  ADB\u2019s  participation  in  project  appraisal.  Given  the  extensive  Korean \nsponsorship  and  technical  content,  the  Export-Import  Bank  of  Korea  and  the  Korea  Trade \nInsurance  Corporation  have  also  played  key  roles  in  the  term  sheet  negotiations  and  due \ndiligence. Following completion of due diligence and finalizing the term sheet in September 2011, \nING successfully launched the transaction to emerging-market-focused project finance banks, \nsegregated into tranches covered by ADB\u2019s PRG and the untied financing schemes of the Export-\nImport Bank of Korea and the Korea Trade Insurance Corporation. \n \n3.  There has been strong support of partners from the Republic of Korea in the development \nof  Uzbek  natural  resources.  In  2005\u20132006,  the  presidents  of  the  Republic  of  Korea  and \nUzbekistan reached a strategic cooperation agreement, which lays the groundwork for a number \nof Uzbek\u2013Korean partnerships in the Uzbek gas and chemical industries. These include the Surgil \nproject\u2014a joint venture between the state-owned oil and gas company National Holding Company \n\u201cUzbekneftegaz\u201d (UNG) and a Korean consortium (Kor-Uz Gas Chemical Investment Ltd)\u2014to \ndevelop the Surgil\u2013North Aral gas and condensate field and a gas-to-chemical process plant. The \nproject also benefits from a pioneering Investment Agreement (IA) between the Government of \nthe Republic of Uzbekistan, Kor-Uz Gas Chemical Investment Ltd, Uz-Kor Gas Chemical and \nUNG, which enables the project to borrow on international project finance terms and conduct \nbusiness according to global commercial standards. \n \n4.  As the second-largest gas producer in the Commonwealth of Independent States behind \nthe Russian Federation, with total reserves of 59.4 trillion cubic feet,2 Uzbekistan is also well-\npositioned with its low-cost feedstock supply to establish a strong chemical industry. Despite \nthis potential and the rate of growth of the commodity petrochemical market in the region, \nUzbekistan has made only a limited foray into the market.3 \n \n5.  The project will be the largest oil and gas project undertaken in Uzbekistan and one of \nthe largest multisource financing schemes in Central Asia to date. The project will provide \nsubstantial benefits to Uzbekistan by enhancing its established gas extraction and processing \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  British Petroleum. 2010.

", "2 \n \nindustry  with  the  capability  to  convert  a  portion  of  the  gas  into  higher-value  chemical \ncommodities to be sold into high-demand manufacturing in the region. ADB\u2019s participation, \nparticularly through leading the due diligence as a direct lender, ensures that the project delivers \non environmental performance\u2014a key stakeholder concern in all chemical industry projects. \nADB, through its commercial cofinancing products, can also help mobilize significant foreign \ndirect  investment  in  Uzbekistan\u2019s  private  sector  and  eventually  ease  the  burden  on  the \nGovernment of Uzbekistan in taking sponsor roles in industrial projects. \n \n2.  Project Design \n6.  The project is located approximately 1,300 kilometers (km) from Tashkent in the Ustyurt \nregion of Karakalpakstan in northwestern Uzbekistan. \n \n7.  The integrated gas-to-chemical project consists of \n(i)  upstream development and operations at the Surgil Field involving drilling new \nproduction wells and constructing upstream infrastructure including expanding \nthe complex gas treatment unit to supply up to 3 billion cubic meters per annum \n(BCMA) of gas and 115 thousand tons per annum (KTPA) of condensate;4 \n(ii)  downstream development and operations at the gas processing site, located \napproximately 115 km southwest of the Surgil Field, involving constructing a new \ngas separation plant, an ethylene cracker,5 a high-density polyethylene plant, a \npolypropylene plant, and associated utilities and supporting facilities; and \n(iii)  associated gas pipelines, product transportation, and water supply infrastructure; \nthe project also includes three 35-megawatt gas turbine generator sets for power \nsupply independent of the national grid. \n \n8.  The project will source gas from its own Surgil Field and will also purchase gas, through \na gas supply agreement with UNG.  Condensate supply (another raw material required for the \npolymer process) is sourced from the Surgil field and through supply contracts with UNG. \n \n9.  The upstream and downstream components of the project will be connected by two \nparallel 115-km pipelines constructed to supply gas and condensate from the Surgil Field to the \ngas separation plant. The process technology will be supplied by each of the downstream \nengineering,  procurement,  and  construction  (EPC)  contracts  and  will  be  fully  aligned  with \ntechnology license arrangements, providing the project with process performance guarantees \nand ongoing technical support from the process licensors.  \n \n3.  The Borrower and/or Sponsor \n10.  Uz-Kor Gas Chemical is a joint-venture company which is 50% owned by Uzbekistan\u2019s \nstate-controlled UNG and 50% by a consortium of Korean companies: Honam Petrochemical \nCorporation (45% of the Korean consortium), Korea Gas Corporation (45%), and STX Energy \n(10%).  Uz-Kor  Gas  Chemical  was  incorporated  in  Uzbekistan  in  May  2008  as  a  project \ncompany  to  build,  own,  and  operate  the  project.  The  companies  comprising  the  Korean \nconsortium were chosen on a selective basis from companies within the Republic of Korea with \nrelevant commercial experience to implement the project. UNG was founded in 1992 as the \n                                                \n4  Condensate is a mixture of hydrocarbon liquids present in the gaseous state as natural gas is produced. It is \ncomposed of C5 and heavier hydrocarbons. \n5  Cracking is a high-temperature process that splits ethane and propane (paraffins) carbon-hydrogen bonds into \ndouble-bonded ethylene and propylene (olefins) and aromatics. Olefins are highly reactive and are suitable for \nprocessing into higher-value chemical derivatives. ", "  3 \n \nwholly state-owned holding company of Uzbekistan\u2019s oil and gas industry. UNG is the second-\nlargest natural gas producer in the Commonwealth of Independent States, after Gazprom. \n \nB.  Development Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n1.  Impact \n11.  The project adds incremental economic value to the output of three natural-gas fields by \nprocessing  an  extracted  commodity  to  two  value-added  streams:  purified  methane  for \ncommercial use, and key chemical intermediate polymer products for downstream plastics and \ntextiles manufacturing. The exported chemicals increase the proportion of value-added products \nin Uzbekistan\u2019s total exports, which increases Uzbekistan's economic share in the resource. The \ndemonstration effect of a large-scale project, with application of the Investment Agreement, \nincreases the opportunities for further foreign direct investment in Uzbekistan\u2019s private sector \nlarge-scale manufacturing industry. This impact will have been largely facilitated by ADB\u2019s early \ninvolvement in structuring the due diligence of the project and in enhancing the attractiveness of \nthe project to commercial financing sources. \n \n2.  Outcome \n12.  The project's outcome is a significant expansion in the value-added chemical process \nindustry in Uzbekistan and the increase in value of a key natural resource. As a result, 3,373 \nKTPA of natural gas will be processed into 387 KTPA of high-density polyethylene, 83 KTPA of \npolypropylene, and 2,568 KTPA of methane-rich processed gas (footnote 1). The project will \nboost long-term employment by adding approximately 3,500 direct jobs during construction and \n1,090  during  operations,  in  addition to  indirect  employment  opportunities. This  outcome  is \nsignificant as the Karakalpakstan region of Uzbekistan is characterized by high unemployment \nand poverty and the project will directly address this through hiring programs that will recruit \ndirectly from the Karakalpakstan community. \n \n3.  Outputs \n13.  The project's output is a facility constructed and commissioned as envisaged in the \nproject documents and in compliance with ADB environmental and social safeguards. The \noutput is readily verifiable by performance demonstration required under the EPC contracts and \ntechnology licenses and the measurement of EPC contract milestones. \n \nC.  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n1.  Consistency with Strategy 2020 and Country Strategy \n14.  ADB's Strategy 20206 emphasizes ADB\u2019s support for efficient energy infrastructure, \nimproving regional cooperation and intraregional supply chains, forging stronger financial links \nwith Asian countries, and bridging the technology gap. The project supports these objectives by \ndeveloping gas fields where the outputs will be separated into fuel and higher-value chemical \ncommodity products. The project\u2014and its focus on export to regional demand centers in \nCentral Asia, the Russian Federation, and Turkey\u2014will demonstrate Uzbekistan\u2019s commitment \n                                                \n6  ADB. 2008.

Consistency with Country Strategy \n15.  The country strategy and program, 2006\u20132010 seeks to promote development in sectors \nwhere  Uzbekistan  has  a  comparative  advantage,  i.e.,  natural  gas  and  manufacturing. 9 \nDemonstration  of  the  Investment  Agreement  structure  supports  the  strategy  objective  of \nimproving  the  business  environment  through  improved  financial  norms  and  enabling \ninvestments for sustained gross domestic product growth. The project leverages the country\u2019s \ncomparative advantage for increasing the value-addition of exports and upgrading the practices \nand skills in its large-scale manufacturing industry. \n \nD.  Project Cost and Financing Plan \n16.  The total project cost is approximately $4.0 billion, to be funded 65% with debt and 35% \nwith equity. \n \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n17.

The  downstream  work  is  divided  into  three  lump-sum  EPC \ncontracts: (i) utilities and offsite works (Hyundai Engineering Company), \n(ii)  ethylene  cracker  (GS  Engineering  and  Construction),  and  (iii) \ndownstream  gas  separation  plant  and  polymer  plants  (Samsung \nEngineering).  \nOperations    \nArrangements \nRevenue  Gas offtake: UNG is the exclusive buyer of processed and unprocessed \nStructure  gas from the project for 30 years.  \n \nPolymer offtake: The sponsors are the sole offtakers of polymers from the \nproject,  with  some  offtake  contracts  assigned  to  commodities  trading \norganizations.   \nOperation and  Operation and maintenance will be conducted by Uz-Kor, with the main \nMaintenance  project  sponsors  (UNG,  Honam,  and  KOGAS)  seconding  experienced \npersonnel and providing technical resources to a dedicated operation and \nmaintenance  team  within  Uz-Kor.  UNG  will  operate  and  maintain  the \nupstream facilities prior to commercial start-up of the downstream plants. \nPerformance  Key performance indicators, including output and outcome indicators, will \nMonitoring  be reported by Uz-Kor.   \nADB = Asian Development Bank, EPC = engineering, procurement, and construction, KOGAS = \nKorea Gas Corporation, TCM = thousand cubic meters, UNG = NHC \u201cUzbekneftegaz\u201d \nSources: ADB and International Netherlands Group. \n \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \nA.  The Assistance \n18.  The proposed ADB loan of up to $125 million to finance the development of the project \nwill be provided from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources without government guarantee. The ADB \nloan will have a maximum tenor of up to 13 years, including a grace period of up to 5.5 years, \nand will be repaid semiannually.  \n \n19.  The proposed PRG of up to $275 million of principal, interest and fees will cover certain \nrisks under loans from commercial lenders to Uz-Kor Gas Chemical to finance the project. The \nPRG will have a tenor of up to 13 years and match the original tenor of the commercial loans \ncovered by the PRG. Under the PRG, ADB will cover the risks of currency inconvertibility, non-\ntransferability of funds, war, terrorism and political violence, and breach of contract (for which \nthere must be default on an arbitral award or denial of recourse) in respect of the loans of \ncommercial lenders. The guaranteed lenders must be eligible beneficiaries under ADB's policy \nrelated to credit enhancement.  \n    \nB.  Value-Added by ADB Assistance \n20.  ADB is a cornerstone lender to the project and has played a key role in the successful \ncommercial syndication. Petrochemical-focused commercial banks may take up to the full \namount  of  the  $275  million  PRG-covered  tranche,  introducing  a  level  of  financial  and \ncommercial value to the project that may otherwise have been unavailable to a large-scale \nfinancing scheme in Central Asia. Beyond the project, ADB\u2019s role in this pioneering financing \nshould have a legacy effect on future foreign direct investment in Uzbekistan\u2019s private sector. \n ", "6 \n \n \n21.  ADB\u2019s participation assures that environmental and social mitigation and enhancement \nmeasures will be implemented effectively. By following ADB\u2019s safeguards and social policies \n(including the application of World\u2019s Bank Group environmental, health, and safety guidelines) \nwill demonstrate the application of international environmental and social standards and best \npractices  to  Uzbekistan\u2019s  manufacturing  sector  and  will  raise  performance  standards  in \noccupational health and safety, emissions and effluent control and measurement, emergency \nresponse techniques, and community engagement. \n \nC.  Risks \n22.  The deal team assessed the following key risk issues during due diligence. Independent \nadvisors have indicated that risks are mitigated to the extent of, and in some cases in excess of, \nindustry best practice. \n \n(i)  Engineering, procurement, and construction risk. Construction risk is mitigated \nby the presence of strong EPC contracts with leading EPC firms.  The sponsors are \nalso providing strong execution support.  \n \n(ii)  Market/Offtake risks. The project is competitive with other marketers of polymers \nbecause of its unique advantage of captive gas supply as a raw material instead of \npurchasing ethylene raw material on the commodities market.  \n \n(iii)  Gas supply risk. Gas reserves from the Surgil field and UNG national supply are \nconsidered adequate for the project throughout the tenors of the project\u2019s loans.    \n \n(iv)  Legal and regulatory risk.  The transaction is exposed to legal and regulatory risk, \nwhich is perceived to be high in Uzbekistan. Foreign investment in Uzbekistan is \nrelatively new (as is project financing) with few precedents.  \n \n(v)  Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative. Uzbekistan has not implemented \nthe Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative and therefore does not publish a \nreport detailing revenues from extracted resources and discrepancies in reported \nvolumes  and  revenues from  extractive  companies.  The  project,  however, falls \noutside of the scope of EITI as it does not sell natural resources (unprocessed gas) \nto the export markets. \n \nIV.  POLICY COMPLIANCE \nA.  Safeguards and Social Dimensions \n23.  Safeguards.11 The project is classified as category A in terms of  environmental impacts \nand triggers ADB\u2019s safeguard requirements on environmental assessment and planning for \npollution prevention and abatement, biodiversity conservation, and occupational and community \nhealth and safety. An environmental and social impact assessment was carried out and an \nenvironmental and social management plan (ESMP) has been prepared in line with national \nlaws and regulations and ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement, including International Finance \nCorporation\u2019s Environmental, Health, and Safety Guidelines. There are no habitats with high \n                                                \n11  Safeguards and Social Dimensions Summary, and Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible \nfrom the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). ", "  7 \n \nbiodiversity value within the project area of influence. Sudoch\u2019ye Lake State Reserve is located \nupstream of the project by a distance of at least 50 km from the Surgil complex gas treatment \nunit and 30 km from the Ustyurt gas chemical complex and therefore the project will not have \ndirect impacts on this protected site.  \n \n24.  Potential  indirect  impacts  during  construction  that  may  be  caused  by  the  influx  of \nconstruction workers will be avoided and minimized through strict implementation of education \nprograms  and  hunting  bans.  Potential  health  impacts  and  pollution  will  be  minimized  and \nmitigated  through  proper  implementation  of  the  ESMP.  Uz-Kor,  as  a  recently  formed \norganization, is committed to sound environment and social management through setting up an \nenvironmental health safety and social management system, including a grievance mechanism, \nto be in place prior to the commencement of construction and operations. Uz-Kor has appointed \nan environmental and social manager since July 2011 at the head office in Tashkent to be \nsupported by a qualified and experienced team at the head and field offices to oversee the \nESMP implementation and act as main point of contact with the EPC contractor. The cost of \nmitigation measures, monitoring and training activities has been estimated and included in the \nproject  budget.  Consultations  were  conducted  with  local  residents  and  district  government \nofficials  and  information  on  the  project,  ESMP  implementation,  availability  of  jobs,  local \nrecruitment policy, HIV/AIDS awareness program was disclosed and discussed in Akchalak, \nMuynak,  and  Kungrad  settlements  in  July  2010,  March  2011  and  July  2011.  Issues  and \nconcerns raised and responses made by Uz-Kor during the consultations were documented in \nthe environmental and social impact assessment which was disclosed on the ADB website in \nAugust 2011. Uz-Kor has appointed a community liaison officer who will be the local contact for \nenquiries and complaints.  \n \n25.  The project is classified as C for involuntary resettlement and indigenous peoples. The \nproject will be constructed in the uninhabited bed of Aral Sea and state-owned semi-arid desert \nlands in the Ustyurt Plateau. All prior land allocations did not entail involuntary resettlement \nimpacts nor affect any indigenous peoples. The population in the project area is comprised of \nKarakalpaks, Uzbeks, Kazakhs, Russians, Tatar, Koreans, Turkish, and others. No adverse \nproject impacts on these ethnic groups are expected and none of these ethnic groups are \nconsidered indigenous peoples under the criteria of ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement.    \n \n26.  Other social dimensions. The project is expected to provide employment and business \nopportunities to the local community and income (through taxes) to the local governments.  \nWhere it is justified in respect of considerations of cost and quality, Uz-Kor and its contractors \nwill  adopt  a  quota  for  women  and  ensure  that  unskilled  labor  workforce  is  proportionally \ndistributed based on ethnic distribution in the region/district. Uz-Kor and its contractors will \ncomply with ADB\u2019s Social Protection Strategy12 including internationally recognized core labor \nstandards.    The  Project  will  also  address  key  issues  facing  local  women  by  providing \nemployment and business opportunities and improving local infrastructure which will improve \nthe living conditions of women in Akchalak settlement.     \n \nB.  Anticorruption Policy \n27.  Uz-Kor has been advised of standardized approach to anticorruption and its policy of \nimplementing best international practice relating to the combating of money laundering and the \nfinancing of terrorism. ADB will ensure that the investment documentation includes appropriate \nanticorruption provisions and remedies for ADB in the event of noncompliance.  \n                                                \n12 ADB. 2001.
