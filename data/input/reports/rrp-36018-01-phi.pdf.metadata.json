An  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE)  was \nAssessment  undertaken, and the summary IEE is a core appendix. \n    \nRationale  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) is supporting the Philippine \nGovernment's plans to restructure and privatize the electric power \nindustry,  and  create  a  competitive  wholesale  electricity  spot \nmarket  (WESM).  Important  requirements  of  a  competitive \nelectricity  market  include  a  functional  wholesale  market \nmanagement system and adequate transmission capacity. With \nthe implementation of a WESM, competition in the power sector \nwill bring electricity prices closer to marginal cost in the medium \nand long term. All of the transmission components included in the \nproposed  Project  are  also  of  high-priority  for  the  National \nTransmission Corporation (TRANSCO) as defined in its least-cost \ntransmission  development  plan.  In  particular,  the  substation \nexpansion will enable completion of rural electrification programs \nin Mindanao, one of the poorest regions in the Philippines. The \nProject  fits  into  ADB's  country  operational  strategy  for  the \nPhilippines. \n   \nObjective and Scope  The Project will support the Government\u2019s objective to improve \nthe  accessibility,  quality,  affordability,  and  sustainability  of  the \nnational electricity supply by (i) facilitating the establishment of a \nspot  market  so  that  electricity  generation  is  dispatched  on  a \ncompetitive basis to meet the power demand at a lower cost, and \n(ii) reinforcing and upgrading the critical transmission lines and \nsubstations in Luzon and Mindanao to ensure a reliable power \nsupply and provide capacity for rural electrification.  \n   \nProject Description  The Project consists of two parts. Part A includes procurement \nand installation of the WESM market management hardware, with \nsoftware and system integration including consultancy services. \nPart B includes (i) upgrading the Luzon transmission grid [about \n80 kilometers (km) of 230 kilovolts (kV) double circuit transmission \nlines from San Manuel in Pangasinan Province to Concepcion in \nTarlac Province and 37 km of double circuit transmission lines, \nfrom Concepcion to Mexico in Pampanga Province and substation \nexpansions],  and  (ii)  expanding  the  Mindanao  substation \n(procurement  and  installation  of  additional  power  transformers \nand power circuit breakers at the Bislig, Butuan, Davao, Kibawe, \nSta. Clara, and Tindalo substations). \n ", "ii \n   \nCost Estimates  The  total  cost  of  the  Project,  including  physical  and  price \ncontingencies, and interest during construction, is estimated at \n$106.0 million equivalent, including a foreign exchange cost of \n$85.5 million and a local currency cost of $20.5 million equivalent. \n   \nFinancing Plan  The ADB loan of $40.0 million will finance part of the foreign \nexchange cost, or 38% of the total project costs. The Japan Bank \nfor International Cooperation (JBIC) will cofinance the foreign cost \nof the Project through an untied loan of $45.5 million. TRANSCO \nwill allocate $20.5 million, or 20% of the total project costs, to \nmeet the counterpart funding requirements. \n   \nLoan Amount and Terms  A loan of $40.0 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources will \nbe provided under ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR) \nbased lending facility. The loan will have a 20-year term including \na  grace  period  of  6  years,  an  interest  rate  determined  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending  facility,  a \ncommitment charge of 0.75% per annum, a front-end fee of 1.0%, \nand such other terms and conditions as are set forth in the draft \nLoan Agreement. \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  Until 30 June 2009 \n   \nEstimated Project  31 December 2008 \nCompletion Date \n   \nExecuting Agency  TRANSCO \n   \nImplementation  TRANSCO  has  appointed  a  project  director  and  a  sufficient \nArrangements  number of suitably qualified and experienced staff, and sufficient \nresources to adequately monitor and coordinate the Project.  \n \n   \nProcurement  Procurement for all components will be carried out in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. For Part A of the Project, \na turnkey contract will be awarded using international shopping. \nUnder Part B, a turnkey contract will be awarded for the Luzon \ntransmission  upgrading  using  international  competitive  bidding \n(ICB)  procedures.  Such  procedures  will  also  be  used  for  the \nsupply  and  delivery  of  materials  and  equipment  for  Mindanao \nsubstations expansion. Civil works will be undertaken and funded \nby  TRANSCO  using  standard  local  competitive  bidding \nprocedures of the Borrower and TRANSCO provided that these \nprocedures will fulfill its general obligation to cause the project to \nbe carried out with due diligence and efficiency, and in conformity \nwith sound engineering or other appropriate practices. \n \n   ", " \nConsulting Services  About 48 person-months of international and 24 person-months of \ndomestic consulting services will be required for management and \nimplementation supervision. The consultants will be selected by \nTRANSCO using quality-and-cost-based selection based on full \ntechnical proposals in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the \nUse of Consultants.  \n   \nProject Benefits and  With the introduction of WESM, generation will be dispatched on \nBeneficiaries  the  basis  of  prices  bid  into  the  market,  with  the  lowest  price \ngenerator being dispatched first.  In this way, for each trading \nperiod, the price of electricity bought and sold on the wholesale \nmarket will be set by the electricity demand and the prices bid by \ncompeting generators to supply energy into the market.  Initially, \ngiven the surplus of generation connected to the grid, wholesale \nelectricity  prices  are  expected  to  decline.    Over  time,  as  the \nsurplus generation is absorbed, prices can be expected to rise \ncloser  to  the  long  run  marginal  cost  of  electricity  generation, \nproviding economic signals to encourage efficient investment in \nnew generation. \n \nUpgrading  the  Luzon  transmission  line  capacities  will  enable \npower from plants in northern Luzon to be transmitted efficiently \nand reliably to the main load centers in and around Metro Manila. \nExpansion  of  the  Mindanao  substations  will  increase  the \nsubstation  capacities,  thereby  assuring  efficient  and  reliable \ndelivery of power to customers in rural areas in particular.  \n \n   \nRisks and Assumptions  Some  risks  are  associated  with  the  proposed  Project,  and \nmeasures are included to minimize their occurrence and effect. \nThe design of the WESM in the Philippines has taken into account \nthe lessons learned in developing electricity markets in other parts \nof the world. The technical risks associated with the proposed \ntransmission  development  components  are  considered \nmanageable because the design and construction are based on \nconventional and proven technologies.  \n \n   ", "iv \nTechnical Assistance  Advisory technical assistance (TA) amounting to $800,000 will be \nprovided by ADB from its TA funding program as a grant to help \nthe Department of Energy facilitate the transition from the current \nregulated market to a competitive electricity market. Specifically, \nthe  TA  will  (i)  prepare  the  bid  documents  for  the  market \nmanagement system and assist with bid evaluation, (ii) provide \nindependent advice to the Government prior to and during the \ninitial implementation of the WESM, (iii) develop a transition plan \nfor the selection of an independent market operator (IMO) for \nWESM, (iv) conduct an industry consultation process in relation to \nthe appointment of the IMO, (v) prepare tender documents for the \nselection of the IMO, and (vi) assist in the bid evaluation and \ncontract  negotiations.  Consultancy  services  will  be  required  in \npower  markets,  regulation,  and  information  technology.  The \nservices will be coordinated by a team leader. About 16 person-\nmonths  of  international  and  4  person-months  of  domestic \nconsultants  will  be  required.  The  consultants  will  be  selected \nusing  quality-and-cost-based  selection  based  on  full  technical \nproposals in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants.  \n \n   \n ", " \n ", "vi ", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the National Power Corporation (NPC), to be guaranteed by the Republic of the Philippines \n(the  Government),  for  the  Electricity  Market  and  Transmission  Development  Project  (the \nProject).  The  report  also  describes  proposed  technical  assistance  (TA)  to  assist  the \nGovernment in the transition to competitive electricity market, and if the Board approves the \nproposed loan, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, will approve the TA. \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n2.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has had a long involvement in, and is highly \nsupportive of, the Government's plans to restructure and privatize the electric power industry, \nand create a competitive electricity market. Such restructuring is in conformity with ADB's \nEnergy Policy,1 and is a vehicle to help overcome many of the current problems of the sector. \nThe appraisal mission2 was fielded during 22 July to 9 August 2002 to determine the scope of \nthe  Project  on  the  basis  of  the  preparatory  work  of  the  earlier  proposed  transmission \ninterconnection and reinforcement project (TIRP).3  Three components of the TIRP are now \nincluded in the proposed Project because their implementation cannot be deferred further as \nthey are critical to avoid disruptions in the transmission system and  for the creation of a \ncompetitive market. In line with the Government\u2019s least-cost transmission development plan, the \nProject will also enable implementation of accelerated rural electrification programs, particularly \nin Mindanao, one of the poorest regions in the Philippines. The Project fits into ADB's country \noperational strategy for the Philippines. The project framework is attached as Appendix 1 and \nthe chronology of project processing is in Appendix 2. \n \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n1.  Energy Sector \n3.  Being highly dependent on imported energy, the Philippines has to contend with price \nfluctuations  in  international  energy  markets.  As  such,  exploration  for  and  development  of \nindigenous energy resources to enhance self-sufficiency has been a continuing thrust of the \nGovernment since the oil crisis of the 1970s. In addition to the increasing use of indigenous \ncoal, oil, geothermal, and hydro resources, the development of the Malampaya gas field and the \nsuccessful commissioning of natural-gas fired power stations in 2002 has significantly increased \nthe country\u2019s energy self-sufficiency ratio to more than 50% from 44% in 2001. Increased \nemphasis has recently been given to the use of new and renewable energy resources such as \nwind, solar, and mini-hydro, which are expected to be increasingly used to generate electricity in \nremote areas. \n \n                                                 \n1   ADB, 2000. Energy 2000: Review of the Energy Policy of the Asian Development Bank, Manila \n2   The Mission consisted of Yongping Zhai (Energy Specialist - Mission Leader), F. Cleo Kawawaki (Commercial \nCofinancing Officer), Toru Hayakawa (Financial Analyst), Xinning Jia (Project Economist), Elsie L. P. Araneta \n(Project Counsel), Yue-lang Feng (Senior Environment Specialist), L. Blanchetti-Revelli (Social Development and \nResettlement Specialist), and M. Minc (Senior Portfolio Management Specialist). \n3   The TIRP included Leyte-Mindanao Interconnection as its major component and three other components, i.e. (i) \nLuzon transmission upgrading, (ii) Mindanao substation expansion, and (iii) power trading and pooling system. \nThe processing of the TIRP was suspended after loan appraisal due to the Government\u2019s decision to seek private \nsector financing for the Leyte-Mindanao Interconnection. The implementation of the other three components was \nalso deferred pending the finalization of National Power Corporation\u2019s privatization plan. ", "2 \n4.  The  Department  of  Energy  (DOE)  formulates  policies  for  the  planning  and \nimplementation of a comprehensive program for the efficient supply and economical use of \nenergy  consistent  with  the  approved  national  economic  plan  and  with  the  policies  on \nenvironmental  protection.  The  program  provides  a  mechanism  for  the  integration, \nrationalization, and coordination of the Government\u2019s energy projects. In particular, the DOE \nprepares annually the Philippine Energy Plan (PEP), which provides for the integrated and \ncomprehensive exploration, development, utilization, distribution, and conservation of energy \nresources, with a preferential bias for environment-friendly, indigenous, and low-cost sources of \nenergy. \n \n2.  Electricity Subsector \n5.  Prior to the ongoing power sector\u2019s restructuring, power generation functions in the \nPhilippines were shared between the NPC and several independent power producers (IPPs) \nwith  contracts  to  sell  electricity  to  NPC  and  Manila  Electric  Company  (MERALCO).  The \ntransmission functions were carried out by NPC. Distribution was carried out by MERALCO, 16 \nprivately owned utilities, 7 municipal systems, and 119 member-owned electric cooperatives \nthat manage retail sales mostly in rural areas. NPC was also engaged in the direct sale of bulk \nelectricity to large industrial customers.  \n \n6.  The total installed generating capacity at the end of 2001, excluding the small island \ngrids, amounted to 13,459 megawatts (MW) consisting of 71% in Luzon, 14% in the Visayas, \nand 15% in Mindanao. The generation mix comprised 19% hydropower, 14% geothermal, 28% \ncoal-based thermal, and 39% oil-based thermal plants.   \n \n7.  As of December 2001, the transmission system had a substation capacity of 22,390 \nmegavolt amperes (MVA), of which 83% is in Luzon, 10% in the Visayas, and 7% in Mindanao. \nIts transmission lines of various voltages extend up to 30,373 circuit-kilometers (km), of which \n66% is in Luzon, 15% in the Visayas, and 19% in Mindanao.  \n \n8.  As  part  of  the  PEP,  the  Power  Development  Plan  (PDP)  and  the  Transmission \nDevelopment Plan (TDP) are prepared by DOE on the basis of the power demand projections. \nAs the current surplus generating capacity will be gradually absorbed by the growing demand \naround 2005, the PDP provides for a net capacity addition of about 11,600 MW up to 2011. \nAccordingly, the TDP envisages an addition of 11,376 km of transmission and subtransmission \nlines and 22,450 MVA of substation capacity. Aside from the new transmission projects, the \nTDP also incorporates rehabilitation and upgrading works to ensure the reliability of the existing \nnetworks.  \n \n  3.  Poverty Issues and the Sector \n \n9.  Inadequate basic infrastructure, including roads and electricity facilities, has limited the \ndevelopment of rural areas. By the end of 2001, electrification at village level was 82%, leaving \nabout 7,000 villages unelectrified. About 80% of the households in unelectrified villages are \nbelow the poverty threshold level of annual income of P55,470 (in 2000 prices) or $1,073. \nAccess to electricity is uneven; close to half the households in the lowest 40% income group \nlack access to electricity as compared to 9 out of 10 households in the highest 60% income \ngroup having access. In Mindanao, even the non-poor have a relatively low level of coverage \nindicating that access rather than affordability is the issue. \n ", "3 \n10.  The  Government  has  an  accelerated  rural  electrification  program  that  targets  the \nelectrification of all villages by 2006. Parallel with electrification efforts, the Government aims to \nreduce poverty in the areas to be electrified by promoting income-generating activities that may \nbe introduced following electrification. The cost of rural electrification is relatively high due to the \npredominantly residential customer profile, low per capita electricity consumption, and high \nsystem  losses.  For  this  reason,  a  number  of  provisions  have  been  made  to  benefit  rural \ncustomers. One such provision is the village electrification fund established by Republic Act \n7638 of 1998 from levies from power generation facilities. The fund partly finances village \nelectrification in communities hosting these facilities.  \n \n4.  External Assistance to the Sector \n11.  ADB is the lead official development partner in the energy sector, with a focus on the \nelectricity subsector. Since 1971, ADB has provided 24 loans with a combined amount of \n$2.258  billion  to  help  develop  the  Philippine  energy  sector,  including  19  loans  to  NPC, \nguaranteed by the Republic of the Philippines, with a combined value of $1.557 billion. In \naddition to its lending, ADB has given 29 technical assistance (TA) grants to the energy sector \ntotaling $10.7 million covering areas such as coal industry development, rural electrification, \nenergy  conservation,  tariff  and  pricing  studies,  regulation,  consumer  impact  assessment, \ngeothermal steam and  natural gas pricing studies, power development planning, feasibility \nstudies, and environmental assessments. A list of ADB assistance to the energy sector is in \nAppendix 3. \n \n12.  Other major multilateral and bilateral agencies involved in the sector include the World \nBank, Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC), Export-Import Bank of the United States \n(US), US Agency for International Development (USAid), US Trade and Development Agency, \nKreditanstalt f\u00fcr Wiederaufbau (KfW), Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) \nFund, and Kuwait Fund. ADB has been coordinating its assistance to the sector with other \nagencies,  in  particular  the  World  Bank  and  JBIC.  Annual  consultation  meetings  are  held \nbetween ADB and JBIC to coordinate cofinancing activities.   \n \n5.  Lessons Learned \n13.  Of the 19 ADB loans to NPC, 18 projects have been physically completed and 8 of these \nhave been subjected to post evaluation review. Five post evaluated projects were found to be \ngenerally  satisfactory  and  the  other  three,  partly  satisfactory. 4  The  principal  problems \nencountered were front-end delays, mainly because of protracted procurement procedures and \nslow approval of contract awards. To reduce such delays, NPC standardized bidding documents \nand specifications, and formed a project management group headed by a vice president. Loan \ndirectors assigned to this group are appointed for all major projects to ensure that project-\nrelated  work  is  properly  coordinated  and  processed  without  undue  delay.  The  project \nperformance  audit  reports  also  highlighted  the  need  to  improve  NPC\u2019s  power  demand \nprojections. With the assistance of an ADB-financed study,5 NPC has used advanced load \nforecasting techniques for preparing its power development plan since 1995. NPC enhanced its \npower  planning  capabilities  in  1997  by  installing  modern  software  capable  of  handling \n                                                 \n4   The partly satisfactory loans were: Loan No. 291-PHI, Fourth Mindanao Power Project, (implementation delays \nand cost overruns); Loan No 326-PHI, Fifth Mindanao Power Project, Manila (implementation delays and cost \noverruns); and Loan No 542-PHI, Rural Electrification Project, Manila (implementation delays and withdrawal of \nsome counterpart financing). \n5   ADB. 1993. TA1966-PHI, Long-Term Power System Planning Study, for $600,000 approved on 20 October 1993. \nManila. ", "4 \ninterconnected systems and environmental aspects.  Recent transmission line projects have \nalso been delayed by problems in negotiating rights-of-way (ROWs) for the lines.  TRANSCO \nhas now established its Social Engineering Department, which is responsible for addressing \nROW issues during the planning phase before a project commences.  This department is \nresponsible for preparing a resettlement plan prior to approval of ADB-financed projects. \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n1.  Major Problems \n14.  In the early 1990s, Luzon experienced severe power shortages, leading to prolonged \nblackouts and adverse impacts on the economy. With the Government\u2019s support, NPC and \nMERALCO contracted IPPs to resolve the power crisis. The East Asian financial crisis starting \nin 1997 suppressed economic growth and reduced electricity demand, leading to surplus power \ngenerating capacity. NPC\u2019s debt service burden has spiraled upwards in recent years due to the \nlack  of  Government  equity  for  capital  expansion  programs,  NPC\u2019s  heavy  reliance  on  debt \nfinance,  and  the  major  depreciation  of  the  peso  against  foreign  currencies  in  NPC\u2019s  debt \nportfolio.  Moreover,  the  IPP  contracts  included  high  cost  premiums  because  of  perceived \ninvestor risks. NPC, in some cases, paid fixed capacity charges to IPPs without availing of the \nelectricity supply. Transmission bottlenecks, caused mainly by delays in obtaining the ROWs for \nconstruction of new lines, together with the excess capacity, have resulted in additional costs. In \nthe distribution subsector, power losses are high, as 20 electricity cooperatives have system \nlosses in the range of 16% to 20%, and another 24 electric cooperatives have system losses in \nexcess of 20%. A combination of these factors has resulted in Philippine power rates being one \nof the highest among ADB\u2019s developing member economies (Table 1).  \n \nTable 1: Comparative Electricity Retail Tariffs in Selected Asian Economies \n(US cents/kWh, as of December 2001) \n \nCountry   Residential  Commercial  Industrial \nHong Kong, China   11.0-13.9  12.5  8.9 \nIndonesia  3.7  6.1  4.4 \nRepublic of Korea  4.8-18.8  6.9-8.0  2.6-9.1 \nMalaysia  5.7-7.3  4.4-7.5  3.9-5.0 \nSingapore  11.7  6.9-8.8  6.7-8.2 \nThailand  1.6-5.5  2.3-2.5  2.3-2.5 \nViet Nam  3.2-6.0  6.2  1.4-3.5 \nPhilippines  10.7  10.3  10.0 \nSources: ASEAN Center for Energy, Korea Electric Power Corporation (KEPCO), Republic of Korea; China Light and \nPower Group (CLP), Hong Kong, China; Perusahaan Listrik Negara (PLN), Indonesia. \n \n15.

From an economic perspective, a \ncomparison of NPC's 2001 tariffs (generation and transmission) against the long-run marginal \ncost (LRMC) 6 reveals that Luzon tariffs were 1.52 times the LRMC, Visayas tariffs 1.33 times, \nand Mindanao tariffs 0.66 times (Table 2).  \n \n                                                 \n6 The LRMC is the cost of delivering an additional unit of electricity to meet reasonably expected demand, including \ncapital investment costs and the variable costs of operation. When the LRMC is accurately reflected in energy \nprices, both producers and customers will tend to make optimal decisions that will ensure the sustainable \ndevelopment of the power industry.

Power Sector Restructuring Program \n16.  The particular problems facing the power sector in the Philippines must be addressed if \nan accessible, high quality, affordable, and sustainable electricity supply is to be assured. The \nGovernment has therefore decided to restructure the electric power industry. This restructuring \nis similar to that undertaken in many other countries and will involve (i) disaggregation of the \nindustry into generation, transmission, distribution, and supply, (ii) introduction of competition in \nthe  generation  and  supply  sectors,  (iii)  introduction  of  a  wholesale  electricity  spot  market \n(WESM), (iv) privatization of generation and operation of transmission by a concessionaire, (v) \nintroduction of open access to distribution networks, and (vi) regulation of the industry by a \nregulator independent of government.  \n \n17.  Restructuring of the power sector has progressed along the lines established by the \nElectric Power Industry Reform Act (EPIRA) approved in June 2001. Under the EPIRA, Power \nSector  Assets  and  Liabilities  Management  Corporation  (PSALM)  has  been  established  to \nmanage  the  privatization,  TRANSCO  has  been  constituted  as  a  stand-alone  transmission \norganization,  and  the  independent  Electricity  Regulatory  Commission  (ERC)  has  been \nestablished.  Furthermore, NPC has been reorganized in preparation for privatization. A final \ndraft of the WESM rules has been issued and the grid and distribution codes have been \npromulgated. The Joint Congressional Power Commission endorsed the PSALM\u2019s privatization \nplan for NPC on 29 August 2002 and the President of the Philippines signed the privatization \nplan on 4 October 2002. According to the plan, a qualified private concessionaire will be \nselected in the first half of 2003 to operate TRANSCO\u2019s transmission assets. The generation \nassets will be privatized through international competitive bidding in the second half of 2003. \n \n18.  ADB has actively supported power industry restructuring. In 1998, ADB approved the \npower  sector  restructuring  program  (PSRP)  loan  to  the  Republic  of  the  Philippines.7 The \nprincipal objective of the PSRP is to support the Government\u2019s initiatives to create competitive \nelectricity markets. Despite the challenging reforms required under the PSRP, the Government \nhas made satisfactory progress. The PSRP loan\u2019s first tranche of $100 million was released in \nDecember 1998 following compliance with 13 conditions precedent to Board consideration. \nSince then, ADB has been closely monitoring the implementation of the PSRP, and continuing \npolicy dialogue has been associated with monitoring progress on various actions under the \nPSRP.  The  second  tranche  of  $100  million  was  released  in  December  2001  following \ncompliance with 6 conditions and waiver of 2 conditions that were partly complied with. The \nlatter 2 conditions have since been substantially complied with. Of the 6 third tranche release \nconditions, 5 have been complied with, and 1 substantially complied with. The release of the \nthird tranche of $100 million was approved by the Board on 13 November 2002.8 \n                                                 \n7  ADB. 1998. Loan 1662-PHI: Power Sector Restructuring Program, for $300 million, approved on 16 December \n1998. Manila. \n8  ADB. 2002. Progress Report on the Power Sector Restructuring Program Progress Report (Release of Third \nTranche). November 2002. Manila. ", "6 \n3.  Project Rationale \n19.  By  2011  electricity  demand  is  forecast  to  increase  by  130%  above  current  levels.  \nConsistent with the PEP, continuing reinforcement of the transmission grid is required to support \nthis increased demand.  If such reinforcement does not occur, the quality and sustainability of \nthe electricity supply will deteriorate and transmission losses will increase to uneconomic levels.  \nThe Project is consistent with this required capacity augmentation and, more particularly, with \nADB\u2019s policy objectives in supporting the development and restructuring of the Philippines\u2019 \nelectricity industry. \n \n20.  An important facet of power sector restructuring is the establishment of the WESM. The \nWESM will facilitate competition in electricity generation. Under the WESM, each day will be \ndivided into 24 one-hour trading periods. Generation will be dispatched on the basis of prices \nbid into the market, with the lowest price generator being dispatched first. In this way, for each \ntrading period, the price of electricity bought and sold on the wholesale market will be set by the \nelectricity demand and the prices bid by competing generators to supply energy into the market.  \nInitially, given the surplus of generation connected to the grid, wholesale electricity prices can \nbe expected to decrease. Over time, as the surplus of generation is absorbed, prices can be \nexpected to rise closer to the LRMC of electricity generation, providing economic signals to \nencourage efficient investment in new generation. \n \n21.  While PSALM has decided to establish a pilot market management system (MMS) in the \nfirst half of 2003 to undertake initial market operations and to train market participants, the \nProject will provide the permanent MMS hardware and software that is necessary to operate a \nfully functional WESM. This will be designed to allow for phased implementation so that it will \ninitially support a market with limited functionality, which will not depend on the availability of all \nthe planned systems needed to support fully automated market operation across all three \nTRANSCO grids. As enhancements to the transmission system are completed, the functionality \nof the MMS will be progressively improved. These enhancements are in progress and financed \nby the World Bank. A more detailed description of the WESM, and its relationship to other \nongoing projects, is given in Appendix 4. \n \n22.  A competitive wholesale market will be more efficient if the transmission network has \nsufficient capacity to transport the power between the generators competing for dispatch and \nthe load. If a transmission network is capacity constrained, cheaper generation may need to be \nreplaced by more expensive plant located closer to the load. This will increase market prices \nand reduce the overall effectiveness of the market. The Project will increase the capacity of the \ntransmission  network  by  strengthening  the  existing  230  kilovolt  (kV)  network  to  provide  a \nbackup  transmission  corridor  between  the  generation  in  Northern  Luzon  and  Manila. \nFurthermore,  the  San  Manuel-Concepcion-Mexico  transmission  lines  that  will  be  upgraded \nunder  the  Project  are  hazardous  since  they  no  longer  meet  minimum  ground  clearance \nrequirements due to the impact of the Mt. Pinatubo eruption.  Based on TRANSCO\u2019s load flow \nsimulations, the San Manuel-Concepcion-Mexico transmission lines are sometimes overloaded \neven under normal operating conditions.  \n \n23.  The acceleration of rural electrification, particularly in Mindanao, is another important \npolicy objective. Mindanao contains about 24% of the country\u2019s population, and 38% of its poor. \nOver 50% of the people in Mindanao are poor, compared to the national average of 34%. As \nmany  as  62%  of  the  poor  in  Mindanao  have  no  access  to  electricity.  In  view  of  the \nGovernment\u2019s plan for rural electrification and the scheduled commissioning of a new coal-fired \npower station in Mindanao, six major substations in Western, Eastern, Central, Northern and ", "7 \nSouthern Mindanao will be expanded to accommodate the increasing power load in their service \nareas. The substations to be upgraded have been chosen because their maximum electricity \ndemands  are  approaching  the  substation  capacities.  The  expansion  of  the  substations  in \nMindanao will provide additional capacity to support the Government\u2019s objective of electrifying \nall villages by 2006. \n    \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \nA.  Objective \n24.  The  Project  will  provide  the  system  and  infrastructure  to  support  the  ongoing \ndevelopment of the power sector by (i) providing infrastructure to support the establishment of \nthe WESM, which will allow the privatization of electricity generation companies to meet the \npower demand at a lower cost, and (ii) reinforcing and upgrading critical transmission lines and \nsubstations in Luzon and Mindanao, which will improve the reliability of the power supply, and \nhelp expand rural electrification.  \n \nB.  Components and Outputs \n25.  The  Project  consists  of  two  parts.  Part  A  involves  implementation  of  the  market \nmanagement system (MMS) for the WESM, and integration of the system into the wider WESM \ninfrastructure, including consultancy services. Part B involves transmission reinforcement by \nupgrading the Luzon transmission lines and expanding the Mindanao substations. \n \n1.  Part A \u2013 Market Management System for WESM \n26.  This component will provide the computer hardware and software required to manage \nthe bidding, dispatch optimization, and market settlement functions of the WESM. The hardware \nincludes the main servers, application servers, meter data servers, data warehouses, electronic \ncommerce servers, networking equipment, user interface work stations, and backup hardware. \nThe software includes standard and customer-tailored components developed for the Philippine \nWESM, and backup software. Consulting services are required to (i) supervise the performance \nof  the  turnkey  contractor  with  regard  to  software  design  and  hardware  acquisition,  and \nfunctional  testing,  (ii)  perform  quality  control  functions,  (iii)  supervise  and  assist  in  the \ninstallation, system integration, and commissioning phases of the subproject, and (iv) provide \nnecessary training. \n \n27.  The DOE will constitute an autonomous group market operator (AGMO), which will \ninitially operate the market under the administrative supervision of TRANSCO. In accordance \nwith Section 7 of the EPIRA, the AGMO will be replaced, within 1 year of market start, by an \nindependent market operator (IMO) that is financially and technically capable, with proven \nexperience, and with expertise of not less than 2 years as a leading IMO of similar or larger size \nelectricity markets. ADB will assist the AGMO prepare for the operation of the WESM and \nsupport the Government in the selection of the IMO through grant-financed TA (paras. 61 and \n62). \n \n2.  Part B - Transmission Reinforcement  \n28.  Luzon Transmission Upgrading. This component consists of procuring and installing \nlines  and  substation  equipment  to  reinforce  and  upgrade  the  existing  230  kV  overhead \ntransmission network in Luzon to increase the transfer capacities to accommodate the load ", "8 \ngrowth in the concerned provinces. The San Manuel-Concepcion (80 km) and Concepcion-\nMexico (37 km) lines will be upgraded from single circuit-single conductor to double circuit-twin \nconductor (Map 1).  Apart from having low current carrying capacity, these lines have been a \nsafety hazard, with many parts of the line too close to the ground.  Furthermore, substations will \nbe upgraded as necessary to support the increased capacity transmission lines. \n \n29.  Mindanao  Substation  Expansion.  This  component  consists  of  procurement  and \ninstallation of 6 units of 138/69 kV power transformers with a total capacity of 525 megavolt-\namperes (MVA), 9 units of 138 kV and 15 units of 69 kV power circuit breakers at Bislig, Butuan, \nDavao, Kibawe, Sta. Clara and Tindalo (Map 2).  This will accommodate increasing electricity \ndemand and support the government\u2019s efforts to reduce poverty by increasing the capacity of \nconnections to local distribution networks.  The installation of a second transformer at these \nsubstations should also improve system reliability. The expanded substation capacities will \nconnect about 5,000 households in semi-urban and rural areas to the grid. \n \nC.  Cost Estimates \n30.  The total cost of the Project, including physical and price contingencies, and interest \nduring construction, is estimated at $106 million equivalent, including a foreign exchange cost of \n$85.5 million and a local currency cost of $20.5 million equivalent. Detailed cost estimates are \ngiven in Appendix 5, and are summarized in Table 3. \n \nTable 3: Cost Estimates ($ million) \n \nComponent  Foreign  Local  Total \nExchange  Currency  Cost \nPart A: Electricity Market \n  (i)   Hardware and Software  21.0  1.0  22.0 \n  (ii)  Project Management  2.0  1.0  3.0 \nPart B: Transmission Development       \n  (i)  Luzon Transmission Upgrading  26.0  12.0  38.0 \n  (ii)  Mindanao Substation Expansion  11.0  1.5  12.5 \nContingencies & Interest During Construction  25.5  5.0  30.5 \n  Total  85.5  20.5  106.0 \nSource: National Transmission Corporation, Asian Development Bank Estimates \n \nD.  Financing Plan \n31.  With the consent of the Government, NPC has requested a loan of $40.0 million from \nADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources to help finance the Project. The loan will have a 20-year term \nincluding a grace period of 6 years, an interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nLondon interbank offered rate (LIBOR) based lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.75% \nper annum, a front-end fee of 1.0%, and such other terms and conditions as are set forth in the \ndraft Loan Agreement. The borrower will be NPC and the Republic of the Philippines will \nguarantee the loan. TRANSCO will be the executing agency of the Project. The borrower has \nprovided ADB with (i) the reasons for its decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending \nfacility on the basis of these terms and conditions, and (ii) confirmation that these choices were \nits own independent decision and not made in reliance on any communication or advice from \nADB. \n ", "9 \n32.  The ADB loan will finance up to $40 million of the foreign exchange cost, or 38% of the \ntotal project cost. JBIC has indicated that it will cofinance the foreign cost of the Project through \nan untied loan of $45.5 million.  TRANSCO has made budget provision of about $20.5 million, to \nfinance the local currency cost (resettlement, civil and erection works). The financing plan is \nshown in Table 4. \nTable 4: Financing Plan  \n($ million) \nFinancier  Foreign  Local  Total \nExchange  Currency  Cost \n \nADB  40.0            0.0  40.0 \nJBIC  45.5            0.0  45.5 \nTRANSCO              0.0  20.5  26.0 \n       \n  Total  85.5  20.5         106.0 \nADB=Asian Development Bank, JBIC=Japan Bank for International Cooperation, TRANSCO=National Transmission \nCorporation \nSource: Asian Development Bank  \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n1.  The Borrower \n33.  NPC will be the Borrower, and the liabilities under this loan will be transferred to PSALM \nalong with other NPC liabilities in 2003, prior to privatization.9 This arrangement will ensure the \ntimely implementation of the WESM and upgrading of transmission networks in Luzon and \nMindanao. Both project components are necessary for the successful privatization of NPC\u2019s \nassets, and cannot be further delayed to wait for the effective transfer of assets from NPC to \nPSALM.    TRANSCO  cannot  be  the  Borrower,  as  the  approved  privatization  plan  requires \nTRANSCO to remain debt free throughout its corporate term. \n \n34.  NPC\u2019s current charter is contained in Republic Act No 6395, as amended. NPC\u2019s current \nresponsibilities include (i) the development, construction and operation of power generation and \nfacilities throughout the country, and (ii) the sale of electric power in bulk to distributors and \nother large electricity consumers. It is a stock corporation with all shares subscribed by the \nGovernment.  NPC\u2019s corporate powers are vested in a nine member Board. The secretary of \nfinance is currently the chairman of the Board while the secretary of energy is vice-chairman. \nThe president of NPC is appointed by the President of the Philippines and is also a member of \nthe Board.  \n \n35.  In accordance with EPIRA provisions, the transfer of all liabilities and non-transmission \nassets from NPC to PSALM, and all transmission and subtransmission assets from NPC to \nTRANSCO is expected in early 2003. It can be effective only after necessary consents are \nobtained from NPC\u2019s bondholders and bank creditors, which include ADB, JBIC and the World \nBank.  Since  the  transfer  of  assets  and  liabilities  is  considered  a  major  change  in  the \nimplementing arrangements of ADB loans to NPC, a Board paper will be submitted to the Board \nfor consideration after the various implications of the transfer have been properly reviewed. If \nthe Board paper is approved, an omnibus amendment agreement, supplemental to the existing \n                                                 \n9  As of 4th quarter 2002, 12 ADB loan agreements and guarantee agreements remained in force, and a total principal \namount of $664.34 million remained outstanding and unpaid under the loan agreements, together with interest, \nfees, and charges in amounts calculated in accordance with their provisions. ", "10 \nloan  and  guarantee  agreements,  will  be  jointly  signed  by  ADB,  the  Government,  PSALM, \nTRANSCO and NPC. Similar arrangements are being conducted by the Government with JBIC \nand the World Bank for transfer of their respective NPC\u2019s assets and liabilities. \n \n36.  PSALM was formally created in June 2001 under Section 49 of the EPIRA to manage \nthe orderly sale, disposition, and privatization of NPC generation assets, real estate and other \ndisposable  assets,  and  IPP  contracts  with  the  objective  of  liquidating  all  NPC  financial \nobligations and stranded contract costs in an optimal manner. According to the EPIRA, PSALM \nwill exist for a period of 25 years, and all assets held by it, all moneys and properties belonging \nto it, and all its liabilities outstanding upon the expiration of its term of existence will revert to and \nbe assumed by the Government. \n \n37.  Prior to 1997, energy sales increased at an average annual rate of around 7%-9% \n(Table 5). However, the financial crisis that affected the Asian region starting in mid-1997 \nresulted in slower growth of energy sales. While the annual return-on-rate base (RORB) for \n1996 was above the required 8%, it declined to 2.22% in 2000. The debt service coverage ratio \n(DSCR) was 1.56 in 1996, but fell below 1.0 from 1997 to 2001. The power sector restructuring \nwill address these problems. The Government has assured that it will provide PSALM with \nsufficient funds to maintain a DSCR of 1.0 or above. \n \nTable 5: NPC Financial Performance (1996 \u2013 2001) \n \nIndicators  1996 1997 1998 1999  2000  2001\nSales (GWh)  33,381 36,442 37,321 36,987  37,320  37,042\nSales Growth (%)  7.6 9.2 2.4 -0.9  0.9  -0.7\nAverage Rate (P/kWh)  1.91 2.12 2.32 2.42  2.68  3.12\nOperating Revenue (P million)  63,635 77,144 86,611 89,686  100,119  115,698\nOperating Expenditure (P million)  50,317 65,519 79,696 81,196  94,681  108,860\nOperating Income (P million)  13,318 11,625 6,915 8,490  5,438  6,838\nNet Income (P million)  5,543 3,055 (3,617) (5,952)  (12,964)  (10,337)\nRate Base (P million)  161,536 161,808 215,053 251,989  244,756  236,305\nRORB (%)  8.24 7.18 3.22 3.37  2.22  2.89\nDSCR  1.56 0.98 0.92 0.92  0.74  0.70\nDSCR=debt service coverage ratio, GWh = gigawatt-hour, kWh = kilowatt-hour, NPC=National Power Corporation, \nRORB = return-on-rate base.  \nSource: National Power Corporation \n \n2.  The Executing Agency \n38.  TRANSCO will be the executing agency of the Project. TRANSCO was formally created \nin June 2001 under Section 8 of EPIRA to assume the electrical transmission function of NPC, \nincluding  planning,  construction,  and  centralized  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  of \ntransmission and subtransmission facilities. TRANSCO\u2019s organization structure is shown in \nAppendix 6.  \n \n39.  TRANSCO\u2019s current functions and responsibilities include (i) operating the nationwide \nelectrical  transmission  and  subtransmission  system,  (ii)  ensuring  the  reliability,  adequacy, \nsecurity, stability, and integrity of the grid, (iii) improving and expanding transmission facilities, \nconsistent with the TDP and the grid code, and (iv) providing central dispatch to all generation \nfacilities and connected loads. \n ", "11 \n40.  In accordance with NPC\u2019s privatization plan, the Government will retain the ownership of \nTRANSCO  but  its  operations  will  be  leased  to  a  qualified  private  concessionaire  through \ninternational competitive bidding with prequalification. The concessionaire will be responsible for \nthe improvement, expansion, and O&M of the transmission assets. The concession is expected \nto have a period of 25 years, which could be renewed for another 25 years subject to the \nconcessionaire\u2019s satisfactory performance. Upon the expiration or termination of the concession \ncontract, the transmission facilities and assets will revert to TRANSCO. \n \n41.  TRANSCO  is  not  expected  to  have  any  debt  as  PSALM  will  take  over  all  NPC's \noutstanding  obligations  (para.  33).  TRANSCO\u2019s  current  transmission  tariffs,  which  were \napproved by ERC in June 2002, form the basis for the financial projections given in Table 6 (for \ndetails, see Appendix 7). In accordance with EPIRA provisions, TRANSCO\u2019s net profit will be \nremitted to PSALM. As TRANSCO will form an important revenue source for PSALM, it is \nproposed that, in the event TRANSCO is allowed to incur any debt, TRANSCO shall maintain a \ndebt service coverage ratio of at least 1.0 during the project implementation period and at least \n1.3 thereafter. \n \nTable 6: TRANSCO\u2019s Projected Financial Performance \n \nIndicator  2002  2003  2004  2005  2006  2007  2010 \nEnergy Volumes (GWh)  43,982  48,081  52,198  56,930  63,199  68,433  86,715 \nSales Growth (%)  11.3  9.3  8.6  9.1  11.0  8.3  8.2 \nOperating Revenue (P million)  17,012  23,483  25,467  27,725  30,468  32,978  41,687 \nOperating Expenditure (P million)  9,520  11,057  12,280  13,888  13,999  14,780  17,152 \nOperating Ratio (times)   0.56  0.47  0.48  0.50  0.46  0.45  0.41 \nAverage Revenue (P/kWh)  0.39  0.49  0.49  0.49  0.48  0.48  0.48 \nNet Income/(Loss) (P million)  7,393  12,310  12,917  13,486  15,869  17,347  23,292 \nRate Base (P million)  93,594  101,081  114,405  132,048  160,522  182,629  207,754 \nRORB (%)  8.01  12.29  11.53  10.48  10.26  9.96  11.81 \nCash Generation (P million)  4,863  5,486  6,515  8,009  9,907  10,712  13,022 \nGWh=Gigawatt-hour, RORB=return-on-rate base, ADB=Asian Development Bank. \nSource: National Transmission Corporation, Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n42.  The IMO will be responsible for operating the WESM and will be an independent and \nautonomous entity. After it is formed, it will assume the functions, assets, and liabilities of the \nAGMO. The cost of administering and operating the WESM will be recovered through market \ncharges imposed on all WESM participants. For this analysis, it is assumed that the WESM will \nbe introduced only in the Luzon electricity market. The structure of market charges will be \ntransparent and filed with and approved by the ERC. Market charges used here are estimated \nby TRANSCO. A summary of the IMO\u2019s financial projections is given in Table 7.  \n \nTable 7: IMO\u2019s Projected Financial Performance \nIndicator  2005  2006  2007 2008  2009  2010 2011 \nEnergy Volumes Traded (GWh)  43,468  48,255  52,251 56,545  61,179  66,210 70,249 \nMarket Charges (P/kWh)  0.0122  0.0114  0.0107 0.0101  0.0095  0.0091 0.0091 \nOperating Revenue (P million)  530  550  559 571  581  603 639 \nOperating Expenditure (P million)  239  252  266 281  296  312 330 \nOperating Ratio (times)   0.45  0.46  0.48 0.49  0.51  0.52 0.52 \nCash Generation (P million)  291  298  293 290  285  290 310 \nDebt Service (P million)  0.0  0.0  158 158  158  158 158 \nDebt Service Ratio (times)  \u2013  \u2013  1.85 1.83  1.80  1.83 1.95 \nGWh=Gigawatt-hour, kWh=kilowatt hour. \nSource: Department of Energy, Asian Development Bank estimates \n ", "12 \n43.  TRANSCO  has  appointed  a  project  director  to  coordinate  work  on  all  project \ncomponents.  It  has  also  provided  the  project  director  with  a  sufficient  number  of  suitably \nqualified  and  experienced  staff,  including  accounting  staff  and  resettlement  specialists,  to \nadequately implement the Project. The Project will not be affected when the management and \noperation of the TRANSCO grid is passed to a concessionaire, as TRANSCO will continue to be \nresponsible for ensuring that the Project is completed. \n \n44.  In implementing Part A of the Project, TRANSCO will coordinate closely with DOE, \nwhich is the executing agency for the piggy-backed TA. TRANSCO\u2019s project director will provide \nregular progress reports to DOE on the implementation of Part A. In accordance with the EPIRA \nand its implementing rules and regulations, TRANSCO will provide administrative support to the \nAGMO, chaired by DOE. \n \n3.  Implementation Period \n45.  An implementation schedule is given in Appendix 8. With advance procurement action \nthe selection of the consultant for Part A will start in late 2002.  Initial market operation with a \nlimited MMS functionality is planned before the end of 2003 in line with the progress and \nrequirements of the privatization process, with full functionality expected in December 2004. \nComponents under Part B will be completed by December 2008, 6 years after expected loan \napproval  to  match  the  projected  demand  growth,  and  take  into  account  land  acquisition \nconstraints.  \n \n4.  Project Operation and Maintenance \n46.  O&M of Part A will be the responsibility of the IMO in accordance with the EPIRA and \nthe market rules. Oversight of market operation will be provided by the Market Surveillance \nCommittee, constituted under the market rules, and by ERC, which has final responsibility for \nenforcing the rules and regulations governing the operations of the WESM under Section 43 (c) \nof the EPIRA.  On completion of the Project, it is anticipated that the assets constructed under \nPart B will be operated by the TRANSCO concessionaire, who will integrate the O&M of these \nassets with the rest of the transmission grid in accordance with the concession agreement. ADB \nis reviewing the draft concession agreement to make sure that the assets created under the \nProject will be properly maintained and operated. \n \n5.  Procurement \n47.  Procurement for all components financed by the ADB and JBIC loans will be conducted \nin accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. A list of the proposed contract packages \nis given in Appendix 9. \n \n48.  For Part A of the Project, a turnkey contract will be awarded for the MMS because this \ncomponent involves closely integrated hardware supply, software development, installation, and \ncommissioning. The software and complementary hardware needed for the WESM are available \nonly from a limited number of suppliers10 and early establishment of WESM is of paramount \nimportance for the power sector restructuring and privatization, and an initial market system is \n                                                 \n10  For an interim market management system originally proposed for the World Bank financing through limited \ncompetitive bidding, eight firms from North America, Europe, Asia, and the Pacific were invited to bid for the \ncontract but only four submitted proposals.  ", "13 \nrequired to be operational in late 2003. Thus, international shopping with a ceiling of $22 million \nor other procurement mode acceptable to ADB will be allowed.  \n \n49.  Draft bid documents for the MMS have been prepared but adjustments will be required \nto provide for phased development and early delivery of hardware and software. To facilitate the \nprocurement process, a panel of experts will be included in the piggy-backed TA. The experts \nwill revise the bid documents to ensure that they (i) reflect current WESM requirements, (ii) \nprovide for a phased implementation consistent with the Government\u2019s industry restructuring \nand privatization program, and (iii) incorporate a transparent bid evaluation process that is \nconsistent with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement.  The panel of experts will also assist DOE \nand TRANSCO with bid evaluation. \n \n50.  For Part B, the separate turnkey contract under international competitive bidding will be \nused for upgrading the Luzon transmission, because this component involves closely integrated \nmanufacturing and installation processes for the high voltage transmission lines and associated \nsubstations. The international competitive bidding procedures will be used also for the supply \nand delivery of materials for expansion of the Mindanao substations. Erection and installation \nwill be undertaken and funded by TRANSCO on a local competitive bidding basis in accordance \nwith standard procedures of TRANSCO, provided that these procedures will fulfill its general \nobligation to cause the project to be carried out with due diligence and efficiency, and in \nconformity with sound engineering or other appropriate practices. \n \n51.  TRANSCO and the Government understand that ADB's anticorruption policy will apply to \nthe Project, and ADB\u2019s standard bidding documents will have to be used. TRANSCO is also \naware  of  the  section  on  fraud  and  corruption  that  was  added  to  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for \nProcurement, particularly the need for bidders, suppliers, or contractors to observe the highest \nstandard  of  ethics  in  the  procurement  and  execution  of  ADB-financed  contracts,  and  the \napplication of sanctions if fraud and corruption are discovered. \n \n52.  The  last  ADB  loan11 to  NPC  experienced  significant  front-end  delays  because  of \nprotracted bid evaluation and contract award processes. TRANSCO has agreed to critically \nreview its performance in this area, and take whatever action is necessary to ensure that bid \nevaluations  and  contract  awards  for  the  Project  are  completed  in  accordance  with  the \nimplementation schedule agreed with ADB. \n \n6.  Consulting Services \n53.  About 48 person-months of international and 24 person-months of domestic consulting \nservices will be required to supervise the implementation of Part A. Outline terms of reference \nand cost estimates for these tasks are given in Appendix 10. A consulting firm will be selected \nby TRANSCO using quality-and-cost-based selection, based on an evaluation of full technical \nproposals  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other \narrangements satisfactory to ADB for engagement of domestic consultants.  \n \n54.  Engineering  design  and  construction  supervision  for  Part  B  will  be  carried  out  by \nTRANSCO, which has adequate experience and resources transferred from NPC in this area. \nThrough  implementation  of  externally  supported  projects,  TRANSCO  staff  have  been \n                                                 \n11 ADB. 1997.

", "14 \nresponsible  for  environmental  management  and  monitoring  programs  and  have  acquired \nadequate capacity and human resources for the Project. \n \n7.  Disbursement Arrangements \n55.  Disbursements  for  all  ADB-financed  components  will  be  withdrawn  from  the  loan \naccount in accordance with the ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook. TRANSCO has been \nadvised that, when commitment letter procedures are used, the minimum withdrawal amount is \n$50,000  and,  therefore,  TRANSCO  will  request  the  contractors  through  the  contract \nnegotiations to avoid small shipments under the commitment procedure. \n \n8.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n56.  Both the borrower and TRANSCO have well staffed and competent units to carry out \ntheir financial planning and budgeting functions. The financial planning units have developed \ncomputerized models for simulating performance under a number of scenarios. The budget \nunits  prepare  and  update  the  annual  budget  and  measure  performance  against  budget \nestimates. The external audits of both NPC and TRANSCO are conducted by the Government\u2019s \nCommission on Audit, and covers their financial statements and operations. The external and \ninternal audit functions are satisfactory. \n \n57.  Both the borrower and TRANSCO will submit their audited financial statements to ADB \nwithin  6  months  of  the  end  of  each  financial  year.  NPC  and  TRANSCO  confirmed  their \nunderstanding  of  ADB's  new  policy  on  submission  of  audited  accounts,  which  specifies \nmeasures in the case of a failure to submit audited accounts and financial statements within \napplicable due dates agreed with ADB. \n \n58.  TRANSCO will provide ADB with quarterly progress reports concerning the Project's \nfinancial  aspects,  resettlement  and  environmental  issues,  procurement,  manufacturing  and \nconstruction activities, and all civil works. To facilitate postevaluation of the Project, TRANSCO \nwill provide ADB within 3 months of physical completion of the Project, a completion report that \nwill comprehensively cover details of project implementation, benefits and costs, and any other \ninformation that may be requested by ADB concerning the Project. \n \n9.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n59.  TRANSCO will compile and analyze data to facilitate project performance monitoring \nand evaluation. It will forward this information to ADB in accordance with the agreed schedule of \nperformance measurement indicators to assess the macroeconomic impact and achievement of \nsector development goals of the Project. \n \n60.  Annual ADB review missions will monitor the progress of the Project. The focus of these \nreviews will be to determine a need for any deviation from the project design or implementation; \ncost overruns; loan reallocations; and any other factors, including assumptions and risks that \nmight  constrain  the  satisfactory  implementation  of  the  Project  and  achievement  of  its \ndevelopment objectives. \n \nIV.  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n61.  The Government has requested ADB to provide advisory TA to ensure the transition to a \ncompetitive electricity market. The TA will (i) review the bid documents for the MMS and assist ", "15 \nwith bid evaluation, (ii) provide independent advice to DOE and the Government prior to and \nduring initial operation of the WESM, (iii) develop an implementation plan for the selection of the \nIMO, (iv) conduct industry consultations, and (v) prepare tender documents and assist in the \nselection of the IMO. The TA will include a panel of experts to revise the existing MMS bid \ndocuments (para. 49).  The consultancy services will be required in power markets, regulation, \nand information technology under the overall coordination of a team leader. About 16 person-\nmonths of international and 4 person-months of domestic consulting services will be required. \nThe outline terms of reference are in Appendix 11. The panel of experts will be selected by ADB \nand engaged as individual consultants in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants.  For the balance of the TA, a consulting firm will be selected on the basis of a full \ntechnical proposal using quality and cost-based selection in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines \non the Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for the engagement of \ndomestic consultants.  \n \n62.  The total cost of the proposed TA is estimated to be $1.15 million, comprising a foreign \ncost of $700,000 and local currency costs of $450,000 equivalent. It is proposed that ADB \nfinance $800,000 on a grant basis from the ADB funded TA program and the Government will \nprovide $350,000 counterpart funding in local currency equivalent. DOE will be the executing \nagency for the TA and will work in close collaboration with TRANSCO and other concerned \nagencies. DOE will assign a TA leader and counterpart staff. DOE will provide the consultant \nwith  adequate  office  accommodation  in  Manila,  support  secretarial  staff,  telephone,  and \nphotocopy and office services.  The panel of experts will undertake its work over four months \ncommencing in January 2003.  The consulting firm will complete the TA during a 12 month \nperiod, from January to December 2004. \n \nV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \nA.  Financial and Economic Analysis \n1.  Economic Analysis \n63.  The establishment of the wholesale electricity spot market and transmission upgrading \ncomponents are complementary and both are necessary to ensure that a sufficient trading \nmarket for power is created. The two components have therefore been evaluated together in the \neconomic analysis by comparing with-versus-without project scenarios. Without the Project, the \npresent structure of the market and tariffs containing distortion will continue, and this will prevent \nthe generation and transmission systems from \u201csignaling\u201d the true economic price of electricity. \nWith the Project, a competitive electricity market and adequate transmission networks will be \nestablished. A competitive generation tariff that is \u201ceconomic\u201d and significantly determined by \nthe interaction of market supply and demand will be introduced, and the predicted lower price of \nelectricity will generate more power consumption by end users. \n \n64.  The economic internal rate of return (EIRR) of the Project has been calculated for a \nperiod of 20 years, including construction and operation periods, and is estimated at 24.1% \n(Appendix 12). The EIRR calculation has been subjected to sensitivity analysis to test the effect \nof possible unfavorable changes in key variables. The sensitivity analysis indicates that it would \nrequire an increase in costs of 73.4% or a decrease in benefits of 42.3% to reach the cutoff \nEIRR of 12%. \n ", "16 \n2.  Financial Analysis \n65.  A financial analysis was undertaken using 2002 constant prices (Appendix 13). The \nfinancial analysis for Part A was based on the assumption that the WESM will be operated by \nthe IMO, which will be an autonomous and independent entity. On the other hand, the financial \nbenefits for Part B were measured as the result of multiplying the incremental electricity sales \nrealized through upgrading the transmission lines and expanding of the substation capacities by \n2002 unbundled transmission tariffs. The integrated financial internal rate of return (FIRR) for \nthe Project was also computed, simply by summing the costs and the benefits for Parts A and B. \nThe results of the analysis are summarized below.  \n \n66.  Part A: MMS for WESM.  The income source for the WESM will be the market operation \nfees, which will be approved by ERC and collected from the market participants. The market \noperation fees have been estimated by TRANSCO to be P0.0132/kWh in 2005 and the traded \nelectricity volumes are estimated to increase gradually from 43,468 gigawatt-hour (GWh) in \n2005 to 66,210 GWh in 2010.12 It is assumed that about 76% of the nationwide electricity \nvolumes will be traded through the WESM because WESM will initially be available for Luzon \nIsland. Based on these assumptions, the estimated FIRR for the WESM (part A) is 10.9%, \ncompared with a weighted average cost of capital (WACC) of 5.3%.  \n \n67.  Part B: Transmission Reinforcement.  Upgrading the Luzon transmission system will \nenable electricity from the power plants in Luzon to be transmitted to the main load centers, \nincluding Metro Manila, and expanding the Mindanao substations will reinforce the substations \nto meet increased system demand. For Part B, the FIRR was computed based on a 2002 \ntransmission tariff of P0.3220/kWh for Luzon with projected incremental electricity transmitted \nthrough  the  upgraded  transmission  lines,  and  a  subtransmission  tariff  of  P0.1476/kWh  for \nMindanao, with projected incremental electricity transformed through the expanded substations. \nThe main project costs for Part B are equipment, civil works, resettlement, and incremental \nO&M costs. Based on the assumptions, the FIRR for part B is estimated to be 16.9%, compared \nwith a WACC of 5.3%.  \n \n68.  The Project (Parts A and B).  The FIRR of the Project was computed by summing up \nthe cash flows for costs and revenues of parts A and B. Based on the above assumptions, the \nFIRR for the Project is estimated to be 14.9%, compared with a WACC of 5.3%. The financial \nnet present value, discounted at WACC, is about P 3.9 billion. \n \nB.  Poverty Reduction \n69.  Electricity is an input to most economic processes, and thus is an important ingredient of \nthe economic development that is essential for poverty reduction. The Project will help provide a \nreliable  electricity  supply  to  satisfy  the  forecast  electricity  demand,  including  the  demand \ncreated by accelerated rural electrification initiatives. Although the impact on poverty reduction \nof the Project has not been quantified, the lower power tariff and application of a lifeline rate13 \nwill benefit poor consumers. Upgrading the Luzon transmission system and expanding the \nMindanao substations will help meet the additional power demand in their service areas and \nfacilitate rural electrification, which will benefit the poor directly and indirectly. With access to \nelectricity, the rural poor will enjoy better education, entertainment, communication, health, \n                                                 \n12 The traded electricity volume includes the electricity actually bought and sold through the spot market, and the \ntransactions under bilateral contracts dispatched through WESM (para. 78). \n13  The EPIRA provides the introduction of a socialized pricing mechanism called a lifeline rate for the marginalized \nend users to be set by ERC. ", "17 \ncomfort, convenience, and productivity. A summary poverty reduction and social strategy of the \nProject is in Appendix 14. \n \n70.  A distribution analysis of Project\u2019s net benefits was undertaken, based on the results of \nthe Project economic and financial analyses. The Project effects were distributed among the \nstakeholders that gain or lose including TRANSCO, consumers of the project electricity, the \nGovernment, and labor involved in the Project. The analysis indicates that as a result of the \nProject, while there is an outflow from the Government investing in the Project, TRANSCO, \nconsumers and labor all gain economic benefits from the Project. The analysis concludes that a \nsubstantial portion of the project benefits will go directly to the consumers including low-income \nhouseholds and the Project will achieve its primary objective of pro-poor economic growth. \n \n71.  The  Project  aims  to  help  eliminate  cross-subsidies  and  move  prices  toward  cost-\nreflective rates by introducing competition into the subsector. As in any removal of subsidies, \nthere is scope for potential welfare losses, and poor households are generally more vulnerable \nunder such circumstances than the non-poor. Mitigating mechanisms are designed to leverage \nfuture gains and reduce the near-term burdens of adjustment. One of the measures is ERC\u2019s \nsetting of lifeline rates for marginalized end users. The lifeline pricing scheme, as an income \nredistribution measure, is to be reconciled with the system of minimum billing to cover the fixed \ncosts of providing electricity services. The lifeline tariff policy is also to be supplemented by \nprograms to improve and make less costly the access of poor households, especially rural poor, \nto electricity supply.  \n \nC.  Environmental and Social Issues \n1.  Environmental Aspects \n72.  The equipment procured under Part A of the Project will be installed inside TRANSCO\u2019s \ncompound in Diliman, Quezon City. Therefore, Part A will not have adverse environmental \nimpacts. Transmission components under Part B are classified environment category B. The \nLuzon  transmission  upgrading  will  use  the  ROW  of  existing  transmission  lines  owned  by \nTRANSCO. As such, the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) does not \nrequire an initial environmental examination (IEE) and issued a certificate of non-coverage to \nthis effect on 16 June 1999. Nevertheless, TRANSCO prepared an IEE for this component to \nmeet ADB\u2019s environmental requirements. The Mindanao substation expansion will be within the \nboundaries  of  existing  TRANSCO  substations  and  DENR  approved  a  certificate  of  non-\ncoverage for this component on 31 January 2000. A summary IEE is attached as Appendix 15. \n \n73.  TRANSCO has agreed that the Project will be designed, implemented, operated, and \nmaintained in accordance with (i) the national environmental laws, regulations, and standards, \n(ii)  all  applicable  provincial  and  local  regulations  and  standards  concerning  environmental \nprotection, land use, and safety, (iii) ADB\u2019s Environmental Guidelines for Selected Industrial and \nPower  Development  Projects,  and  (iv)  safety,  health,  and  environmental  standards  of  the \nGovernment. During implementation, TRANSCO will submit biannual progress reports on the \nimplementation of the mitigating measures described in the summary IEE, and in compliance \nwith safety, health, and environmental standards of the Government. After project completion, \nTRANSCO  will  submit  to  ADB  relevant  documentation  to  demonstrate  that  the  Project  is \noperated and maintained in conformity with the applicable safety, health, and environmental \nstandards.  \n \n ", "18 \n \n  2.  Social Aspects \n   \n74.  Although  the  upgraded  Luzon  transmission  lines  will  use  the  existing  ROW,  the \nupgrading work involves land acquisition and resettlement action for new transmission tower \nfoundation  footing  sites  and  clearance  of  structures  built  within  the  ROW.  The  Luzon \ntransmission upgrading will involve constructing 303 towers, causing land impacts that are \nwidespread but individually of very small magnitude. Permanent land impacts are 6.8 hectares \n(ha) of farmland and temporary losses are 413.8 ha. Of these, 213.0 ha are occupied by rice, \n110.7 ha by sugar cane, 66.0 by corn, and 24.1 by trees. In addition, 299 houses and 92 minor \nstructures  will  be  demolished.  Construction  of  the  transmission  lines  will  affect  1,535 \nlandowners. Permanent land impacts will affect 2,391 families (11,955 people) of which 187 \nfamilies (935 people) are tenants. Temporary land impacts will affect 1,334 families (5,830 \npeople) of which 168 (840 people) are tenants. House loss/relocation will affect 321 families \n(1,605  people);  loss  of  minor  structures  will  affect  46  families  (230  people),  and  loss  of \ncrops/trees will affect 1,535 families (7675 people). About 70 small businesses will also be \naffected. \n \n75.  TRANSCO has prepared a resettlement plan for upgrading the Luzon transmission lines \nin order to facilitate the payment of relocation and compensation. The plan took account of \nfeedback received from the affected communities and the results of socioeconomic surveys. \nADB  conducted  field  inspections,  and  made  appropriate  recommendations  to  TRANSCO \nconcerning implementation of the plan. The resettlement plan and the process used to formulate \nit have been reviewed and comply with ADB\u2019s Policy on Involuntary Resettlement. A summary \nof the resettlement plan is included in Appendix 16.  \n \n76.  TRANSCO has overall responsibility for the land acquisition and resettlement program \nincluding planning, implementation, and financial tasks. Preparation, survey, and monitoring \ntasks will reside with the TRANSCO\u2019s social engineering and ROW management department. \nProject  offices,  in  collaboration  with  local  government  units,  will  be  responsible  for  actual \nimplementation work in the field including consultation with stakeholders, final identification of \naffected families, and delivery of compensation. TRANSCO will establish a monthly reporting \nsystem involving project offices\u2019 staff, local government units and affected families. External \nmonitoring  will  be  assigned  to  an  independent  agency  tasked  with  the  verifying  internal \nmonitoring results and evaluating the resettlement program at the end of the Project. \n \nD.  Project Risks \n77.  Several risks are associated with the proposed Project, and measures are included to \nminimize them. The Project's main risks relate to the pace of the PSRP agreed with ADB. \nTherefore, continued policy dialogue and close monitoring will be necessary to ensure adequate \nprogress in this regard. \n \n78.  Although competitive electricity markets have been successfully implemented in several \ncountries,  the  California  electricity  crisis  has  brought  to  light  the  importance  of  carefully \ndesigning electricity markets. The design of the WESM in the Philippines has taken into account \nthese lessons. For example, with most of the energy demand contracted, the net quantity \nbought and sold on the spot market will only be around 10% initially. The market for this \n\u201cmarginal\u201d demand should be quite competitive since there will be more supply than demand. \nThe market will, however, send out the correct economic signals for trading energy, supplying \nreserves,  building  new  generating  capacity  or  retiring  old  capacity,  locating  new  load  or ", "19 \nwithdrawing  load,  and  reducing  transmission  congestion.  By  retaining  these  economic \nincentives the system should move toward a more efficient and economic industry, as a whole, \nwithout dramatic short-term effects. \n \n79.  The opening and successful implementation of the WESM will be an important feature of \nthe  power  industry  reform,  under  which  generation,  transmission,  distribution,  and  supply \nactivities will be separated into independent businesses. It is important that the Government \nmaintain its commitment to the reforms. ERC will need to monitor and, if necessary prevent \npossible anticompetitive behavior of distribution utilities on the one hand and newly formed \ngenerating companies on the other. These risks have been recognized, and the Government \nhas realized the importance of market competition to the electricity tariff regime. Adequate \nprovisions to mitigate the risks have been included in the EPIRA and its implementing rules and \nregulations.14 ADB has also assisted the Government to define competition policy and strategies \nin the energy sector that will help to further mitigate the risks.15 \n \n80.  Advanced  consultant  recruitment  is  being  undertaken  to  minimize  front-end  project \ndelays. The international consultants will assist TRANSCO supervise the procurement and \ninstallation  of  the  complex  information  technology  equipment  for  the  WESM.    Market \nparticipants are concerned that the selection of IMO be transparent and that the IMO be truly \nindependent in operating the WESM. The piggy-backed TA is expected to mitigate the risks of \nmarket startup by providing independent expert advice to the Government, and by developing \nan implementation plan for the establishment of IMO. \n \n81.  The technical risks associated with the proposed transmission development component \nare considered manageable. Overhead transmission line design and construction are based on \nconventional technology, and power substation expansion will be designed and constructed with \nwell-proven technologies.  \n \nVI.  ASSURANCES \nA.  Specific Assurances \n82.  In accordance with the covenants of its existing loans (footnote 9), NPC is required to \nmaintain a debt service coverage ratio of at least 1.3 times and return on rate base of at least \n8%. PSALM has indicated that, after transfer of assets and liabilities from NPC, PSALM will \nmaintain a debt service coverage ratio of at least 1.0. The Government further assured that, in \nthe event that PSALM\u2019s resources are not adequate to meet the debt service requirement of \n1.0, the Government will make up the shortfall through Government\u2019s budgetary process. These \nassurances will be included in the omnibus amendment loan agreement that is being drafted for \nthe transfer of NPC assets and liabilities to PSALM and TRANSCO (para. 35), and which will be \nsubmitted for Board consideration and approval in due course.   \n \n83.  TRANSCO, being the executing agency and operator of the transmission assets, has \ngiven the following assurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n   \n                                                 \n14  The provisions of the EPIRA and its implementing rules and regulations to prevent market abuse and anti-\ncompetitive  behavior  include  (i)  prohibition  of  cross  ownership  in  TRANSCO  and  the  IMO  (ii)  limits  on \nconcentration of ownership, operation, or control of installed generating capacity and (iii) limits on bilateral supply \ncontracts by a distribution utility.  \n15  ADB. 1998.

Provide and release, in a timely manner, sufficient funds to \nmeet the counterpart funding requirements of the Project, including if necessary, \nloans and other sources acceptable to ADB. \n \n(iii)  Project implementation. Ensure that there will be at all times a project director, \nassisted  by  a  sufficient  number  of  suitably  qualified  and  experienced  staff,  to \neffectively implement the Project. \n \n(iv)  Asset transfer. Seek ADB\u2019s consent prior to transferring the assets of the WESM to \nan IMO.   \n \n(v)  Land acquisition and resettlement. Take appropriate action to acquire prior to \nconstruction, all land and ROWs required for upgrading the Luzon transmission lines \nand implement the approved resettlement plan in accordance with ADB\u2019s Policy on \nInvoluntary Resettlement to ensure that affected persons will be at least as well off \nas they would have been in the absence of the Project. Should the transmission line \neasements change during construction, revise the resettlement plan, including full \ndetails of the losses of land, crops, houses, and other structures resulting from such \nchanges, submit the revised resettlement plan to ADB for approval, and increase the \nresettlement budget as necessary to meet any additional cost. \n \nB.  Conditions for Loan Effectiveness \n  84.  Before the ADB loan becomes effective, the JBIC loan will have been approved and all \nconditions for effectiveness (other than the effectiveness of the ADB loan) will have been \nfulfilled or arrangements satisfactory to ADB for the fulfillment thereof will have been made. \n \nVII.  RECOMMENDATION \n85.

In  the  wholesale  electricity  spot  market  (WESM),  distribution  utilities  and  electricity \nsuppliers will be able to purchase their bulk electricity requirements directly from generators or  \nbuy it on the spot market.  However, in order to encourage participation in the WESM, the \nElectric  Power  Industry  Reform  Act  (EPIRA)  provides  that,  for  the  first  5  years  from \nestablishment  of  the  market,  no  distribution  utility  can  source  more  than  90%  of  its  total \nelectricity requirements from bilateral supply contracts. \n \n2.  The price of electricity sold through the WESM will be set by the electricity demand \nduring a particular trading period and the bids by generators to supply electricity into the market.  \nGenerators  will  be  dispatched  on  the  basis  of  their  supply  bids  and  the  most  expensive \ngenerator will set the clearing price for that trading period.  As generators will be competing for \nsupply on the basis of price, prices can be expected to fall when there is a surplus of generation \n(the current situation in the Philippines).  However, when there is a shortage of generation \nprices will rise to the point where new generators can be expected to enter the market. \n \n3.  Wholesale electricity markets have been established in a number of counties throughout \nthe  world,  including  Australia,  England  and  Wales,  New  Zealand,  Scandinavia  and  an \nincreasing number of states in the United States.  In Asia, wholesale markets are currently \nbeing established in the Republic of Korea and Singapore. \n \n4.  The WESM will be managed by an independent market operator (IMO). The IMO will be \nrequired  to  work  closely  with  the  system  operator,  (National  Transmission  Corporation \n[TRANSCO] or its concessionaire), which will dispatch generation and ensure the integrity of the \nnational electricity supply system. More specifically, the IMO will (i) process offers and bids for \nsupplying and purchasing electricity, (ii) advise the system operator of the generator dispatch \nschedule that will minimize the overall cost to electricity wholesalers, (iii) process metered data \ncollected from the trading nodes, (iv) calculate final wholesale market prices; and (v) facilitate \nthe financial settlement for electricity bought and sold through the market. \n \n5.  The market management system (MMS) to be installed under part A of the Project will \nenable the IMO to perform these functions.  It will include interfaces with the system operator, \ngenerators, and suppliers to provide the technical and financial information needed for the \nmarket  to  operate  successfully.    When  fully  implemented,  information  transfers  are  to  be \nelectronic and automatic. \n \n6.  Under a World-Bank-financed project, TRANSCO is installing the following systems to \nsupport  the  operation  of  the  WESM:  (i)  a  national  control  center  incorporating  an  energy \nmanagement system that will facilitate the centralized and timely dispatch of generation by the \nsystem operator, (ii) upgraded metering that will allow electricity generated or consumed at each \nmarket node to be accurately measured for each trading period, and (iii) a communications \nnetwork that will allow the secure and reliable transmission of generator dispatch instructions \nand metering data to and from the National Control Center. This project is scheduled for \ncompletion by the end of 2003, on time for the WESM to be fully functional. \n \n7.  The World-Bank-financed systems are necessary for the MMS to be fully functional.  \nSince they will not be available for market opening, implementation of the MMS must be \nphased. Initially, the system will have limited functionality and many information transfers will \nhave to be done manually.  As the World-Bank-financed systems are completed, they will be ", "  Appendix 4  29 \nelectronically interfaced to the MMS.  This will permit greater system functionality and the \nincreased automation of market operation. \n \n8.  Given  the  complexity  of  the  WESM  design,  a  phased  implementation  has  other \nadvantages.  It will allow subsystems to be tested and implemented individually.  This will \nreduce the impact of implementation problems that may arise, and give market participants time \nto implement the systems they require to participate in the new arrangements. \n \n9.  As the current owner of most of the generation that will initially participate in WESM, \nNational Power Corporation (NPC) is negotiating transitional supply contracts with distributors.  \nThese contracts, which must be approved by the Energy Regulatory Commission (ERC) before \nthey become effective, will limit the exposure of generators and distributors to large fluctuations \nin the wholesale electricity price during initial market operation. When the transitional supply \ncontracts expire, generators and suppliers will be able to bilaterally negotiate supply contracts, \nshould they wish to reduce exposure to market price volatility.  Over the longer term, the spot \nmarket prices in the WESM will be reflected in bilateral contract prices and all wholesale \nelectricity will move to an economically efficient price level. \n \n86.  The WESM will be applied initially to Luzon Grid and, when fully implemented, will be \nextended to Visayas and Mindanao.  The MMS will be designed to address multi-grids or multi-\nareas, and sized to accommodate data for the whole Philippines. Hence, the Mindanao grid can \nbe covered by the WESM whether it is connected or not to the Luzon and Visayas grid. While \nMindanao remains isolated, competition for electricity supply in Mindanao will be limited to the \ntrading participants in Mindanao. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "30  Appendix 5 \n \n \nCOST ESTIMATES OF THE PROJECT  \n ($ million) \n \n  Foreign  Local  Total\nItem  Exchange  Currency  Cost\nA.

In \nline with this responsibility, PSALM will assume responsibility for all NPC's loan payments and \nother debt repayment obligations, including this loan. PSALM will cease to exist in 25 years and \nat that time all its outstanding liabilities will revert to and be assumed by the Government in \naccordance with the EPIRA. PSALM's cash flow projections up to 2022 are shown in Table \nA7.1.  \n \n2.  NPC's historical financial statements are also included in Tables A7.2, A7.3, and A7.4. \nWhile the figures used were provided by PSALM and NPC, the valuation of the assets and \nliabilities of PSALM (other than debt) is critically dependent on a number of key value drivers. In \nparticular (i) the value of NPC's generation assets depends on the effective price of natural gas \nand the regulated price in transition supply contracts, and (ii) the net present value (NPV) of the \nindependent power producer (IPP) liabilities is fundamentally dependent on (and varies with) \nlong-term  predictions  of  the  competitive  market  price  and  demand  growth.  However  it  is \nconsidered that NPC is currently not financially viable because its total liabilities account for \nabout 90% of its total assets, and its debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) has been below 1.0 \nsince 1997. Therefore, the privatization of NPC and introduction of a wholesale electricity spot \nmarket is considered necessary to the development of a sustainable electricity supply in the \nPhilippines.  \n \n3.  NPC\u2019s privatization plan has been prepared with the assistance of Credit Suisse First \nBoston  and  N  M  Rothschild  &  Sons  (Rothschild).  Both  companies  (the  Advisor)  are \ninternationally reputable and experienced in managing divestitures of this nature. Most of the \nfigures and estimations provided by PSALM have been estimated and reviewed by the Advisor. \nWhile  the  valuation  of  the  assets  and  liabilities  of  PSALM  (other  than  debt)  is  critically \ndependent on a number of key value drivers, PSALM provided the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) with its best estimate of (i) privatization proceeds, (ii) the market value of electricity in the \ncompetitive wholesale market, (iii) operational revenues of Agus and Pulangui hydropower \nstations; and (iv) other relevant information. \n \n4.  As noted above, PSALM will take over all obligations for NPC's loan payments and other \ndebt repayments, including those of TRANSCO, NPC\u2019s small power utilities group (SPUG) and \nthe National Electrification Administration (NEA). While TRANSCO and NPC (SPUG) are to be \nseparated from NPC without debts and incorporated as separate legal entities, PSALM will \nreceive the net profits from the operations of TRANSCO, which is a fully owned subsidiary of \nPSALM, as well as the net proceeds from the privatization of TRANSCO. As the remittances \nfrom TRANSCO constitute a part of the cash inflows for PSALM, the financial projections of \nTRANSCO are also developed in this Appendix.

Assumptions \n \n5.  The cash flow mismatch in the privatization is estimated to be $1.85 billion in 2002. The \nGovernment  successfully  raised  $1.0  billion  in  early  2002  through  the  issue  of  a  7-year \nsovereign bond priced at 8.5% or 344 basis points above the benchmark United States (US) \ntreasury bill rate, of which $750 million will be used for the NPC's liabilities. An amount of $750 \nmillion is expected to be funded through a proposed PSALM bond issue with the guarantee \nsupport of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to lower the coupon rate. The remaining shortfall \nof $350 million is expected to be raised through a separate bond issue with a Government \nguarantee and/or a loan from the Government. For the proposed PSALM bond issue of $750 \nmillion, it is assumed that $250 million will be funded in US dollar (USD), and $500 million \nequivalent be funded in Japanese Yen (JPY). The coupon rates are conservatively estimated at \n10% for USD and 4% for JPY in spite of the ADB guarantee because of the long tenor and \nvolatile market conditions, so that the weighted average coupon rate for this $750 million is \nestimated to be 6%. For $1.85 billion in total, the weighted average rate is estimated to be \n7.49%, which is the assumed interest rate in the projection. It is also assumed in the projection ", "38  Appendix 7 \nthat all new borrowings, including this loan, will be treated equally, all interest on bonds will be \ntemporally capitalized, and all surplus cash will be applied to the repayment or buy-back of the \nnew borrowings.  \n  \n \nC.  Cash Inflows \n \n6.  PSALM\u2019s major revenue sources include (i) universal charges to cover stranded debt \nand stranded contract costs, (ii) net profits from TRANSCO and from the Agus and Pulangui \nhydropower stations, (iii) privatization proceeds, and (iv) debt assumption by the Government of \nup to P200 billion as provided in the EPIRA. If NPC's generation assets are sold to the investors \nat the currently estimated prices in a timely manner and the other revenues are also realized as \nexpected, PSALM will have sufficient resources to service the debt payments. However, there is \na timing mismatch between the receipt of expected revenues and cash outflows, particularly in \nthe initial years. The cash flow deficit in the initial years, especially in 2002, is greater than \nearlier estimated. To examine the certainty of revenue sources, each of them is discussed \nhereunder. \n \n(i).  Universal  charges  are  assumed  to  be  P0.40  per  kilowatt-hour  (kWh),  and  \ncharged to all end-users. The amount collected through the charge is estimated based \non the electricity demand forecast. \n \n(ii).   Revenues of TRANSCO are estimated based on the assumption that only 15% \nof the TRANSCO profits will be remitted to PSALM. This is assumed to be the proportion \ngenerated from subtransmission activities. Profits from the operation and maintenance of \nthe transmission facilities are assumed to be retained by the concessionaire.   \n \n(iii)  While the Agus and Pulangui hydropower stations are operated by NPC(SPUG), \nthe total net revenues will be transmitted to PSALM in accordance with the EPIRA.  \n \n(iv).  The privatization proceeds provided by PSALM\u2019s financial advisor are used in the \nanalysis.  These  proceeds  are  assumed  to  be  paid  (i)  partly  as  up-front  cash \nconsideration; and (ii) as deferred proceeds, which consist of principal and interest \n(interest rate is assumed to be 10%), as illustrated in Table A7.5. The total principal is \nestimated at around $5.4 billion, and the total interest for the deferred payments is \ncomputed to be around $1.6 billion.  \n \nTable A7.5: Privatization Proceeds \n($ million) \n \nItem      Year  \n  2003  2004  2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010  2011 2012\nUp-front  500  1,574  326  \nDeferred      205 205 205 205 205 205  205 205\nInterest      208 194 179 165 151 136  122 108\nSource: Power Sector Assets and Liabilities Management Corporation. \n \n(v).  It is assumed that the Government will inject sufficient funds to ensure that \nPSALM maintains a DSCR of 1.0. The Government is required by the EPIRA (Section \n32) and its Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRRs) (Rule 17) to assume up to P200 ", "  Appendix 7  39 \nbillion (about $4 billion) of NPC debt For the calculation of DSCR, subsidies and loans \nfrom or with the support of the Government are included in the revenues of PSALM. \n \nD.  Cash Outflows \n \n7.  The  debt  obligations  and  IPP  liabilities  of  PSALM  will  in  aggregate  generate  cash \noutflows, which will need to be funded. The total book value of PSALM's liabilities as of 2002 is \nestimated at about $20 billion, including loans and Independent Power Producer (IPP) liabilities. \nIn addition to these, NEA's debts of $0.4 billion equivalent are also assumed by PSALM. \n \n(i).  NPC's loan debts of $9.4 billion, consist of (i) the principal amount about $6.1 \nbillion, and (ii) aggregate interest of around $3.3 billion. In order to calculate the peso \nequivalents of yearly debt services, the foreign exchange rate P51.7 per $ for 2002 is \ndevaluated gradually to P63.0 per $ as of 2012, and stabilized at the level.  \n \n(ii).  IPP  obligations  now  total  some  5.1  gigawatts  (GW)  of  contracted  capacity, \nrepresenting  more  than  40%  of  the  generation  capacity  on  the  system.  The  total \nobligations will rise to 7.2 GW in 2006 and remain above 5.0 GW until 2021 before tailing \noff. A net liability arises if the selling price of electricity in a competitive market is lower \nthan the amounts due under the IPP contracts, whether because of the IPP contract \nprice per kilowatt hour (kWh) or because of the failure to reach minimum off-take levels \nof dispatch, which, in turn, might be linked to rigid fuel supply arrangements as well as \nthe fixed payments due to the plant. With the commissioning of significant new capacity \nin 2000-2002, many of the IPPs are not achieving or will not achieve their minimum \neconomic off-take levels or the levels assumed when the contracts were signed. As a \nconservative  measure,  the  surplus  is  assumed  to  persist  until  2007  under  a  low \neconomic growth scenario. Consequently, NPC's IPP obligations represent a net liability. \nThe amounts of IPP obligations are estimated by PSALM and its advisor.  \n \n8.  PSALM's yearly operation and management costs are estimated at around $2 million. \nHowever, separation payments and transfer taxes are estimated and assumed to be paid by \nPSALM in 2003 and 2004. These are deducted as a part of PSALM's operation costs. In \naddition, NPC plans to invest around P22 billion for capital expenditures, including around P4 \nbillion ($80 million) for WESM and transmission and substation expansion project funded by \nADB  and  the  Japan  Bank  for  International  Cooperation  (JBIC)  this  year.  The  capital \nexpenditures are also deducted as a part of PSALM\u2019s costs of 2002. \n \nE.   Sensitivity Analysis \n \n9.  The base case is shown in Table A7.6. Liabilities are estimated to be recoverable by the \ntotal estimated incomes for 2003-2022, as summarized below. It is noted however that the value \nof IPP liabilities is dependent on the competitive market prices and demand growth, and also \nuniversal charges, which are expected to continue until 2022. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "40  Appendix 7 \n \nTable A7.6: Summary of PSALM\u2019s Liabilities and Revenues \nItem  (P million)  ($ million) \nIPP liabilities (as of 2002)  596,661  11,541\nDept Liabilities (as of 2002)  170,919  5,240\nCurrent Liabilities  175,788  3,400\nInterests on Existing Loans (2003-2022)  147,582  2,547\nNew Borrowing  111,916  2,165\nInterest on New Borrowing  227,643  3,738\nTotal Liabilities  1,530,509  28,631\nSales Proceeds (Principal + Interest)  411,690  7,090\nRevenues from NPC(SPUG)a/TRANSCO  368,075  6,052\nUniversal Charges (P0.40/kWh)  814,916  13,300\nGovernment Debt Assumption  200,000  3,418\nTotal Revenues for 2003-2022  1,794,680  29,860\nDifference between Liabilities and Revenues  264,171  1,229\n  kWh= kilowatt-hour, IPP= Independent Power Producer, NPC(SPUG)= National Power Corporation (Small \nPower Utilities Group), TRANSCO= National Transmission Corporation. \na NPC(SPUG) includes revenues from Agus and Pulangui Hydropower stations. \n  Source: Power Sector Assets and Liabilities Management Corporation, Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n10.  As shown in Table A7.7 below, according to the short term sensitivity tests, an additional \ncash flow mismatch of $1,181 million and $601 million respectively will have to be refinanced in \n2003 if (i) NPC\u2019s privatization is delayed by one year or (ii) the proceeds from the privatization is \n10% lower than the expectation. About $1,474 million additional cash will be required to meet \nthe financial gap if both (i) and (ii) occur. Furthermore, $800 million in PSALM's surplus cash for \nthe projection period will be reduced if both (i) and (ii) occur. The financial analysis assumed a \ngradual depreciation of the local currency from P51.7 per US dollar in September 2002 to P63.0 \nper US dollar in 2012. Sensitivity analysis on further depreciation of local currency has also \nbeen undertaken. The analysis shows that about $975 million will have to be funded during the \nprojected period in case of depreciation of the local currency to P69.5/$ in 2012. Therefore, the \nGovernment has been advised to take all necessary measures to avoid any undue delay in the \nprivatization process and if such delay occurs, the Government will have to meet the cash flow \ndeficit.  \n \nTable A7.7: Sensitivity Tests \nCase  Additional Cash Flow  Pay-out Year of \nMismatch after 2003  New Borrowing \n($ million)  (Year) \nBase Case     317  2020 \n(i) 1 year delay of the privatization  1,181  2021 \n(ii) 10% decrease of the sales proceeds     601  2021 \n(iii) both (i) and (ii) above occur  1,474  2023 \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates.  \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "  Appendix 7  41 \n \nII.  TRANSCO \nA.  General  \n \n11.  The EPIRA requires the transfer of NPC's transmission, subtransmission and related \nfacilities to TRANSCO, and the ownership of TRANSCO to PSALM. As a result of these \ntransfers, TRANSCO will be a major subsidiary of PSALM. The net profits of TRANSCO will \nconstitute a part of the income of PSALM. As TRANSCO will act as Executing Agency for the \nProject, its financial projections for the period 2002-2010 are based on the major assumptions \ndescribed below.  \n \n12.  In accordance with EPIRA, TRANSCO will be formed free of any NPC debt. According to \nEPIRA, TRANSCO will appoint a concessionaire to finance, expand, operate and maintain its \ntransmission facilities. On the other hand, the sub-transmission assets will be sold to Electricity \nCooperatives within 4-5 years. However the financial projections of TRANSCO presented in \nTables A7.8, A7.9 and A7.10 assume it remains an independent and autonomous entity and \ntest the viability of its transmission and sub-transmission operations. \n \nTable A7.8: TRANSCO's Income \n(P million)\nItem  Actual  Projection\n2001  2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007  2008  2009 2010\nEnergy Volumes (GWh)  39,502  43,982 48,081 52,198 56,930 63,199 68,433  74,057  80,126 86,715\nIncrease in Sales  11.3% 9.3% 8.6% 9.1% 11.0% 8.3%  8.2%  8.2% 8.2%\nAverage Revenue Data \nTotal Average Revenue (P/kWh)  0.2311  0.3868 0.4884 0.4879 0.4870 0.4821 0.4819  0.4774  0.4811 0.4807\nIncrease in Average Revenue  67.4% 26.3% -0.1% -0.2% -1.0% 0.0%  -0.9%  0.8% -0.1%\nNet Utility Revenue  9,129  17,012 23,483 25,467 27,725 30,468 32,978  35,355  38,549 41,687\nOther Revenue  0  0 0 0 0 0 0  0  0 0\nTotal Revenue  9,129  17,012 23,483 25,467 27,725 30,468 32,978  35,355  38,549 41,687\nOperating Expenses  7,969  9,520 11,057 12,280 13,888 13,999 14,780  15,228  16,022 17,152\nDepreciation/Depletion  5,423  6,002 6,771 7,605 8,695 9,680 10,203  10,375  10,878 11,700\nPersonal Services  1,504  2,224 2,870 3,222 3,660 2,669 2,829  2,999  3,179 3,370\nOperating & Maintenance  1,038  1,291 1,413 1,449 1,529 1,646 1,744  1,849  1,960 2,077\nProvision for Doubtful Accounts  4  3 3 4 4 4 4  5  5 5\nNet Operating Revenue  1,160  7,492 12,426 13,187 13,837 16,469 18,198  20,127  22,527 24,535\nInterest Expenses  6,991  0 0 0 0 0 0  0  0 0\nIncome after Finance Charges  (5,831)  7,492 12,426 13,187 13,837 16,469 18,198  20,127  22,527 24,535\nInterest Income  139  6 3 3 3 3 3  3  19 279\nOther Income  1,356  71 71 71 71 71 71  71  71 71\nOther Expenses  4,363  176 190 344 425 674 925  1,167  1,389 1,593\nNet Income  (8,699)  7,393 12,310 12,917 13,486 15,869 17,347  19,034  21,228 23,292\nRate Base  91,360  93,594 101,081 114,405 132,048 160,522 182,629 193,327 198,794 207,754\nRate of Return  1.27%  8.01% 12.29% 11.53% 10.48% 10.26% 9.96% 10.41% 11.33% 11.81%\nGWh=gigawatt-hour, kWh=kilowatt-hour \nSource: National Power Corporation/National Transmission Corporation\n ", "42  Appendix 7 \nTable A7.9: TRANSCO's Balance Sheets \n    (P million)\nItem  Actual  Projection\n2001  2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007  2008  2009 2010\nAssets \nTransmission Utility \nTransmission Utility in Service  147,149 153,521 181,338 203,544 241,877 287,752 321,361 344,138 370,075 403,444\nAccumulated Depreciation  51,889  59,136 71,280 82,449 96,186 112,617 129,576 147,726 167,468 189,216\nNet Utility in Service  95,260  94,385 110,058 121,095 145,691 175,135 191,785 196,412 202,607 214,228\nWork in Progress  19,620  34,286 51,591 53,962 34,792 22,604 15,391  21,847  23,487 15,809\nTotal Utility Plant  114,880 128,671 161,649 175,057 180,483 197,739 207,176 218,259 226,094 230,037\nOther Assets & Investments  1,325  1,325 1,325 1,325 1,325 1,325 1,325  1,325  1,325 1,325\nCurrent Assets  2,244  4,704 6,622 6,144 5,368 5,812 5,854  6,039  6,254 10,739\nDeferred Charges  584  553 1,534 1,935 3,192 5,097 6,209  7,094  7,786 8,183\nContingent Assets  8  8 8 8 8 8 8  8  8 8\nTotal Assets  119,041 135,261 171,138 184,469 190,376 209,981 220,572 232,725 241,467 250,292\nEquity and Liabilities \nEquity \nPSALM Equity  0 118,187 118,187 118,187 118,187 118,187 118,187 118,187 118,187 118,187\nAppraisal Surplus  29,823  2,191 10,660 16,107 23,451 37,422 47,879  59,337  71,076 83,192\nRetained Earnings/Others  88,364 \nTotal Equity  118,187 120,378 128,847 134,294 141,638 155,609 166,066 177,524 189,263 201,379\nTotal Liabilities  819  14,853 42,263 50,151 48,717 54,351 54,485  55,180  52,183 48,892\nDeferred Credits  27  24 20 17 14 13 13  13  13 13\nContingent Surplus  8  8 8 8 8 8 8  8  8 8\nTotal Equity and Liabilities  119,041 135,263 171,138 184,470 190,377 209,981 220,572 232,725 241,467 250,292\nPSALM=Power Sector Assets and Liabilities Management Corporation\nSource: National Power Corporation/National Transmission Corporation\n \n  \nTable A7.10: TRANSCO's Cash Flow Statement \n    (P million)\nItem  Actual  Projection\n2001  2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007  2008  2009 2010\nA Total Receipts  9,456  17,089 23,556 25,541 27,798 30,541 33,051  35,428  38,638 42,036\n1.

Assumptions \n \n1.  Basic Assumptions \n \n13.  The  estimated  capital  investments  of  TRANSCO  are  based  on  the  Transmission \nDevelopment Plan. Electricity be transmitted by TRANSCO is estimated to be 43,982 gigawatt-\nhours (GWh) in 2002, increasing gradually to 86,715 GWh in 2010. The domestic inflation rate \nis assumed to be 5.5% while the international inflation rate is assumed to be 2.4% over the \nprojection period. It is assumed that TRANSCO has no foreign currency debt.  \n \n2.  Transmission Tariff \n \n14.  The average revenue per kWh of transmission businesses in 2002 is estimated at \nP0.39/kWh, which is approximately the weighted average between the transmission tariff of \nP0.48/kWh  and  subtransmission  tariff  of  P0.06/kWh  approved  by  the  Energy  Regulatory \nCommission (ERC) in June 2002. The average revenue per kWh of transmission businesses \nover the projection period is envisaged to stabilize over the projection period, at the level of \nP0.48/kWh. \n \n3.   Taxes and Net Incomes \n \n15.  For TRANSCO, a corporate tax is not charged (NPC also enjoys such status) while \nwithholding taxes for deposits in bank, real estate taxes and other taxes are imposed. The \nconcessionaire will probably be charged corporate tax. On the other hand, TRANSCO is obliged \nto remit its net profits to PSALM in accordance with EPIRA. \n \n4.  Liabilities \n \n16.  TRANSCO is currently free from any debt of NPC, and all cash requirements, including \ncapital expenditure and working capital, are assumed to be funded by the concessionaire as \nlong-term liabilities or by PSALM as cash equity infusions, which will be paid back through \nTRANSCO's future incomes. \n \nC.  Sensitivity Analysis \n \n17.  As a basis for a sensitivity analysis, two assumptions: (i) 10% shortfall in estimated \nelectricity volumes, and (ii) 10% decrease in the real terms of transmission tariff together with \ndecreased  electricity  volumes  are  tested  as  shown  in  the  table  below.  According  to  the \nsensitivity tests, TRANSCO is considered financially sound even if the sales are decreased by \n10%.    However,  in  the  unlikely  event  that  transmission  tariff  and  sales  volume  are  both \ndecreased by 10%, TRANSCO\u2019s rate of return (ROR) will drop to 6.49%. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "44  Appendix 7 \nTable A7.11: Sensitivity Tests \nCase  Minimum Net Profits  Minimum ROR \nFor 2003-2010  For 2003-2010 \n(P million)  (%) \nBase Case  12,310  9.96 \n(i) 10% decrease of electricity sales  9,961  8.16 \n(ii) 10% decrease of transmission tariff  7,848  6.49 \n  ROR= Rate of Return. \n  Source: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nD.  Risks \n \n18.  One  of  the  main  risks  to  be  considered  for  TRANSCO  is  whether  PSALM  can \nsuccessfully  select  a  qualified  concessionaire  with  proven  international  experience  in  the \ntransmission business. Due to the constitutional restriction on foreign investor ownership of \npublic utilities, foreign investors have to team up with local partners. ADB is assisting PSALM in \nthe review of the bidding documents for TRANSCO\u2019s concession to ensure that the international \ninvestor will exercise effective management control over TRANSCO\u2019s operations.  \n \n19.  While the transmission tariffs were adequately increased in June 2002, another risk is \nhow the future transmission tariffs will be determined by ERC. ERC is currently studying the rate \nsetting methodologies for transmission businesses and may consider introducing a performance \nbased regulating methodology. It is noted that, in accordance with the EPIRA and its IRRs (rule \n15), the rates are to be set and adjusted so as to allow the recovery of just and reasonable \ncosts and a reasonable ROR to enable TRANSCO to operate viably.  \n ", "   \nIMPLEMENTATION SCHEDULE \n \nIMO=independent market operator, MMS=market management system.  \nSource: Asian Development Bank  \n \n  A\np\np\n  e\nn\n  d\nix\n   8\n   4                \n5", "46  Appendix 9 \n \nTENTATIVE CONTRACT PACKAGES \n \n \n \n \n \nPart  Item  Contract  Procurement  Value \nType  Mode  ($ million) \n         \nA.

General \n1.  The economic analysis has been carried out by comparing a with-versus-without project \nscenario. Without the Project, the present structure of the market and tariffs containing distortion \nwould continue and prevents the generation and transmission systems from \u201csignaling\u201d the true \neconomic price of electricity to the end users. With the Project, a wholesale electricity spot \nmarket  (WESM)  and  adequate  transmission  networks  will  be  established.  A  competitive \ngeneration tariff that is \u201ceconomic\u201d and significantly determined by the interaction of market \nsupply and demand will be introduced, and the predicted lower price of electricity will generate \nmore power consumption by end users. \n \n2.  The economic analysis was conducted using domestic market prices. The economic \nprice of non-traded goods is equal to their domestic prices and a shadow exchange rate factor \nof 1.2 (based on the standard conversion factor of 0.83) was applied to calculate the economic \nprice of traded goods. Due to the local conditions of the labor market, an unskilled labor \nconversion factor of 0.7 in domestic prices was considered. Based on these assumptions, the \nmain costs and benefits have been broken down into traded goods, non-traded goods, and \nskilled and unskilled labor; and specific conversion factors were calculated to value all costs and \nbenefits in economic terms. \n \nB.  Costs \n3.  The main project costs include civil works, equipment, hardware and software, project \nmanagement,  and  incremental  maintenance  and  operating  costs,  land  acquisition,  and \nresettlement with and without the Project. The economic costs were estimated from financial \ncosts including physical contingencies. Price escalation, interest during construction, and taxes \nwere excluded. Residual values of the capital costs were calculated at the end of the project life. \nFinancial costs were converted into economic costs using specific conversion factors for capital \ncosts and maintenance costs. \n \nC.  Benefits \n4.  The main quantifiable economic benefits from the Project are benefits from incremental \nenergy consumption, resulting from a decrease in the price of electricity to the consumer. \n \n5.  The entry of competition in the sector is expected to bring electricity prices closer to \nmarginal costs and force overall average electricity prices lower. With the price decrease to the \nconsumer, more electricity will be consumed in the with-project as compared with the without-\nproject scenario. These benefits accrue to incremental energy consumption and are valued at \nconsumer willingness to pay. The price elasticity is estimated at about -0.3, on which the \neconomic  benefits  from  the  incremental  electricity  consumption  are  measured.  Separate \nwillingness to pay in Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao is estimated and a nationwide average \nwillingness to pay is valued at around P6.09/kWh. \n \n6.  The Project holds other benefits that are not easy to be quantified, which mainly include \nefficiency  improvement  of  power  facilities,  potential  impact  on  cross-subsidies,  as  well  as \nbenefits from reinforcement of transmission and substation. \n ", "54  Appendix 12 \n7.  The promotion of wholesale competition, together with freeing of competition in the \ngeneration sector through a system of marginal cost pricing will fend off the tendency to become \ninefficient,  both  for  production  (generation  side)  and  consumption  (distribution  and  large \nindustrial customer side). With the WESM in place, the power facilities will have to compete on \nthe basis of least cost. The generation facilities will be forced to minimize their operating costs. \nOtherwise, they run the risk of not being dispatched and being priced out of the market by more \nefficiently run facilities. This will add pressure to the power facilities concerned to minimize their \noperating costs, and at the same time, encourage efficiency programs that will improve their \nrespective heat rates thus leading to greater fuel efficiency. \n \n8.  The present cross-subsidies extended by the Government on electricity tariff shield the \nusers of the real value of the product and prevent its economic utilization. The power sector \nreform is scheduled to eliminate the cross-subsidies and move prices toward cost-reflective \nrates by introducing competition into the sector. The positive response of the production sectors \nfrom the expected lowering of industrial and commercial electricity rates due to the elimination \nof cross-subsidies during the transition period and the approach of electricity prices toward \nmarginal cost pricing in the longer run is a significant source of welfare gains for households. \nThe  indirect  welfare  effects  operate  through  increases  in  household  incomes  arising  from \ngreater production activities and the consequent increase in household demand for goods and \nservices.  \n \n9.  The Luzon transmission upgrading subproject will enable power from existing and new \npower plants in Luzon to be transmitted efficiently and reliably to the main load centers in and \naround Metro Manila. The Mindanao substation expansion subproject is expected to increase \nthe substation capacity hence assuring efficient and reliable delivery of power to customers. \nBoth  subprojects  aim  to  promote  the  transmission  facilities,  accommodate  future  demand \nincreases, and ensure sufficient, reliable, and stable supply of power to consumers in the \nselected areas, to meet the country\u2019s expected economic recovery and the projected increase in \nthe economic activities. \n \nD.  Results of Economic Analysis \n10.  The  project  benefits  will  accrue  to  all  the  participants  in  the  grid  system,  namely \ngeneration companies, distribution utilities, suppliers, independent power producers and the IPP \nadministrators, as well as power consumers including the residential, commercial, and industrial \nsectors. In the long run, sizable welfare gains will benefit households, producers, as well as the \neconomy as a whole. The improved transmission network will also enhance access to electricity \nand improve the quality of life of local residents. \n \n11.  The economic internal rate of return (EIRR) of the Project is calculated for a period of 20 \nyears, including construction and operation periods. The EIRR for the Project is estimated at \n24.1% (see Table A12.1). The EIRR calculation is subject to sensitivity analysis to test the effect \nof possible unfavorable changes in key variables (see Table A12.2). The sensitivity analysis \nindicates that it would require an increase in costs of 73.4% or a decrease in benefits of 42.3% \nto reach the cutoff EIRR of 12%, neither of which is likely to occur. \n \n \n \n ", "  Appendix 12  55 \n  Table A12.1: Economic Internal Rate of Return \n(P million in 2002 prices)\nYEAR  COSTS       BENEFITS NET\nCapital  O&M Total Incremental Total  ECONOMIC\nCosts  Costs Costs Energy Consumption Benefits  BENEFITS\n2002  0.00  0.00 0.00 0.00 \n2003  686.66  0.00 686.66 (686.66)\n2004  520.69  0.00 520.69 (520.69)\n2005  802.28  219.49 1021.77 373.96 373.96  (647.81)\n2006  1580.94  219.49 1800.43 830.28 830.28  (970.15)\n2007  672.59  219.49 892.08 899.04 899.04  6.96 \n2008  74.38  303.46 377.85 972.93 972.93  595.08\n2009  0.00  331.07 331.07 1052.66 1052.66  721.59\n2010  0.00  331.07 331.07 1491.13 1491.13  1160.06\n2011  0.00  331.07 331.07 1582.09 1582.09  1251.02\n2012  0.00  331.07 331.07 1678.59 1678.59  1347.53\n2013  15.85  331.07 346.91 1780.99 1780.99  1434.07\n2014  0.00  331.07 331.07 1889.63 1889.63  1558.56\n2015  0.00  331.07 331.07 2004.89 2004.89  1673.83\n2016  0.00  331.07 331.07 2127.19 2127.19  1796.13\n2017  25.02  331.07 356.08 2256.95 2256.95  1900.87\n2018  32.93  331.07 364.00 2394.63 2394.63  2030.63\n2019  8.15  331.07 339.21 2540.70 2540.70  2201.49\n2020  0.00  331.07 331.07 2695.68 2695.68  2364.62\n2021  0.00  331.07 331.07 2860.12 2860.12  2529.05\n2022  (790.38)  331.07 (459.32) 3034.58 3034.58  3493.90\nEIRR =   24.1%  NPV (12%) = 3,040.6   \nEIRR=economic internal rate of return, NPV=net present value, O&M=operations and maintenance\nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates \nTable A12.2: Sensitivity  Analysis  \nScenario  Change EIRR NPV (12%) Sensitivity  Switching\n \n(percent) (percent) (P million) Indicator  a Value (%) b\n1.

Distribution Analysis \n \n12.  The distribution analysis of the Project net benefits was undertaken based on results of \nthe project financial analysis and economic analysis. The domestic price numeraire and the \ndiscount rate of 12% are used for both financial and economic flows.  \n \n13.  Table A12.3 shows the distribution of the project effects (economic minus financial \npresent values) among the stakeholders: NPC/Transco, consumers of the project electricity, the \nGovernment,  and  labor  involved  in  the  Project.  As  a  result  of  the  Project,  all  the  four \nstakeholders  gain.  Transco  gains  a  financial  profit  of  P617  million  from  the  investment, \nconsumers gain a consumer surplus of P4,820 million from the Project, and the Government \ngains P493 million in the investment. It is assumed that 10% of the capital and O&M costs over \nthe project life would come from the employment of labor. This labor including the poor gains a \nnet economic benefit of P21 million because the Project pays wages in excess of the economic \nopportunity cost of the labor.  \n \n14.  The economic pricing of electricity resulting from the WESM and reliable power supply \nfrom transmission system improvement will benefit the consumers (including at least 15% of \nlow-income poor households) and labors directly and indirectly. The analysis concludes that a \nsubstantial portion of the project benefits will go directly to the consumers including the low-\nincome households and the Project will achieve its primary objective of pro-poor economic \ngrowth. \n \nTable A12.3: Distribution Analysis for Electricity Market  \nand Transmission Development Market \n    (Pmillion in present value at 12% discount rate) \n        \n \nNet  Net  Difference Distribution of Project Effects \n \nFinancial  Economic  (Econ-Fin) NPC / Consumers Government/  Labor \n \nReturn  Return  Transco Economy  Total\n \n \nBenefits            5 ,276          1 0,096           4,820\n \nCosts \n    Capital Costs           ( 2,834)           ( 2,640)              194                 1 75                 1 9 \n    O&M Costs           ( 1,522)           ( 1,505)                17                    1 5                   2  \n    Corporate Tax              ( 303)              303                 3 03 \n  Net Present Value               6 17            5 ,950           5,334\n \n  Gains and Losses              617          4,820                 4 93                 2 1           5,950\n \nNPC=National Power Corporation, NPV= net present value, O&M=operation and maintenance, TRANSCO=National Transmission \nCorporation \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n ", "  Appendix 13  57 \nFINANCIAL ANALYSIS \n \nA.  General \n \n1.  The financial internal rate of return (FIRR) analyses for Part A and Part B of the Project \nare undertaken using 2002 constant prices. The financial analysis for Part A, the wholesale \nelectricity spot market (WESM), is conducted on the assumption that WESM will be operated by \nthe independent market operator (IMO), an autonomous and independent entity, while the \nsystem operations will be conducted by the National Transmission Corporation (TRANSCO). \nTherefore, the financial benefits for Part A are evaluated as the net cash flows of the IMO. The \nfinancial benefits for Part B (Luzon transmission upgrading and Mindanao substation expansion) \nare measured by the incremental electricity sales for Part B, which become realized due to \nupgrading the transmission lines and expanding the substation capacities. The financial benefits \nare estimated by multiplying the excess electricity volumes traded over the existing capacities \nby the current transmission tariffs, which are composed of a transmission component for high \nvoltage  electricity  transmitted  by  the  upgraded  transmission  lines  and  a  subtransmission \ncomponent  for  low  voltage  electricity  transformed  by  the  expanded  substations.  While  the \nintegrated nature of Part B is taken into account, the incremental electricity sales are recognized \nas the financial benefits of Part B by using both the estimated excess loads over the existing \ncapacities  of  the  transmission  lines/substations  concerned  and  the  transmission  and \nsubtransmission tariffs. Furthermore, the overall project FIRR analysis is also performed. While \nthe two parts are distinct in nature and WESM will be operated by the IMO, the overall FIRR is \ncomputed simply by summing up the costs and the financial benefits for parts A and B. \n \n2.  Financial analysis is undertaken to assess (i) the degree to which a project will generate \nrevenues sufficient to cover its financial costs, and (ii) the incentives for TRANSCO. These \nassessments are conducted on the basis of comparing the weighted average cost of capital \n(WACC) and the FIRRs. To undertake a sensitivity analysis (i) a decrease in electricity volumes, \n(ii) an increase in working expenses, and (iii) an increase in capital costs are tested separately \nand  jointly.  The  analysis  covers  the  period  of  loan  life  (20  years)  comprising  6  years  of \nconstruction  and  14  years  of  full  operation,  which  is  basically  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  loan \nconditions. The tables for the financial analysis are at the end of this appendix (Tables A13.1-\nA13.3). \n \n \nB.   Costs \n \n3.  Part  A.  The  main  project  costs  for  Part  A  are  hardware  and  software,  project \nmanagement, and the operating and maintenance (O&M) costs. The capital costs for calculating \nthe  FIRR  include  interest  during  construction  and  physical  contingencies,  while  price \ncontingencies are excluded. Corporate income taxes for the IMO are included in the costs, \nbecause although this loan is lent to TRANSCO, which is not obliged to pay corporate income \ntaxes, the IMO will be a taxable entity. It is also assumed that the WESM will be transferred to \nthe IMO with liabilities of total project costs, and the IMO will pay them back to the TRANSCO at \nthe same conditions as this proposed loan. As the capital costs for the WESM are depreciated \nin 15 years, the same level of investment by using its internally generated cash is required after \nthe full depreciation of the WESM assets. Residual values of the capital costs as at the end of \nthe project life are calculated for the FIRR.  \n \n4.  Part B. The main project costs for Part B are equipment, civil works, resettlement, and \nincremental  O&M  costs.  The  capital  costs  for  calculating  the  FIRR  include  interest  during ", "58   Appendix 13   \nconstruction and physical contingencies, while price contingencies are excluded. A corporate \nincome tax is not included in the costs of Part B. Capital costs for Part B are depreciated in 25 \nyears, and the residual values of capital costs are calculated at the end of the project life.  \n \nC.  Financial Benefits \n \n5.  The financial benefits for Part A are net cash flows, which are generated by WESM \noperations and estimated based on the assumptions in paras. 6\u20138. The financial benefits for \nPart B are measured by the incremental electricity sales for Part B, which become realized due \nto upgrading the transmission lines and expanding of the transforming capacities of substations. \nThe benefits are estimated by multiplying the incremental excess volumes traded over the \nexisting capacities by the weighted average transmission tariffs of 2002. \n \nD.  Assumptions \n \n6.  As an important parameter and a proxy for the financial opportunity cost of capital, the \nWACC for the Project is calculated on the following assumptions: (i) 5.6% interest rate on \nforeign debts, including the Asian Development Bank (ADB) loan; (ii) 10.0% funding cost of \nTRANSCO, (iii) 5.5% local inflation rate, (iv) no corporate income tax due to the special status of \nTRANSCO, and (v) around 40% of the project costs funded by ADB and around 40% by the \nJapan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC) respectively, and the remaining raised by \nTRANSCO. Based on the assumptions, 5.3% is computed as the WACC for the Project. \n \n7.  The WESM will provide the required computer software and hardware to control and \nprocess transactions and functions. The income source for the WESM is the market operation \nfees,  which  will  be  collected  from  the  market  participants.  The  market  operation  fees  are \nestimated to be P0.0132 per kilowatt hour (kWh) in 2005 and the traded electricity volumes are \nestimated to increase gradually from 43,468 gigawatt hour (GWh) in 2005 to 66,210 GWh in \n2010. It is assumed that about 76% of the nationwide electricity volumes will be traded through \nWESM because WESM will initially be available only for the Luzon grid. For WESM, the FIRR is \ncomputed based on (i) a project life of 20 years, (ii) the above level of market operation fees, (iii) \noperations and maintenance costs of 4% of the capital costs, and (iv) 32% corporate income \ntax.  \n \n8.  The Luzon transmission upgrading will enable electricity from the power plants in Luzon \nto be transmitted to the main load centers, including Metro Manila. The Mindanao component \nwill enable the reinforcement of substations to meet increased system demand. For Part B, the \nFIRR is computed based on (i) a project life of 20 years, (ii) a 2002 transmission tariff of \nP0.3220  per  kWh  for  Luzon,  with  projected  incremental  electricity  transmitted  through  the \nupgraded transmission lines, and a subtransmission tariff of P0.1476/kWh for Mindanao with \nprojected incremental electricity transformed through the expanded substations, (iii) system \nlosses of 4%; and (iv) incremental O&M costs of 4% of the capital costs of the upgraded \ntransmission line and expanded substation facilities. \n \nE.  FIRR and Sensitivity Tests \n \n9.  The FIRR for Part A is estimated at 10.9%, compared with the WACC of 5.3%. The \nsensitivity analysis showed that the FIRR would decrease to (i) 8.0% if the Project experienced \nan electricity sales decrease of 10%, (ii) 9.0% if its working expenses increased by 10%; (iii) \n9.5%  if  a  10%  cost  overrun  happened;  and  (iv)  4.8%  if  all  (i),  (ii),  and  (iii)  occurred \nsimultaneously.  Therefore,  Part  A  is  considered  financially  viable  under  most  downside ", "  Appendix 13  59 \nscenarios. In addition, the Electric Power Industry Reform Act (EPIRA) stipulates that the costs \nof administering and operating the WESM will be recovered by the IMO through a market \ncharge imposed on all market members.  \n \n10.  Based on the above assumptions, the FIRR for Part B is estimated at 16.9%, compared \nwith the WACC of 5.3%. The sensitivity analysis showed that the FIRR would decrease to (i) \n15.0% if the Project experienced an electricity sales decrease of 10%, (ii) 16.2% if its working \nexpenses increased by 10%; (iii) 15.1% if a10% cost overrun happened; and (iv) 12.5% if all (i), \n(ii), and (iii) occurred. Therefore, under the current assumptions, it is considered that Part B is \nfinancially  viable  as  the  FIRR  exceeds  the  WACC,  and  shows  a  reasonable  incentive  for \nTRANSCO in terms of the incremental cash flows. \n \n11.  The FIRR of the Project is computed by summing up the cash flows for costs and \nrevenues for Parts A and B. Based on the above assumptions, the FIRR for the Project is \nestimated at 14.9%, compared with WACC of 5.3%. The financial net present value discounted \nat  the  WACC  is  about  P3.9  billion.  The  sensitivity  analysis  showed  that  the  FIRR  would \ndecrease to (i) 12.8% of the Project experienced an electricity sales decrease of 10%; (ii) 13.9% \nif its working expenses increased by 10%; (iii) 13.4% if a 10% cost overrun happened and (iv) \n10.3% if all (i), (ii), and (iii) occur. Therefore, under the current assumptions, the overall Project \nis also considered financially viable as the FIRR exceeds the WACC.

Yes  priority in country poverty  \npartnership agreement?  Yes \nContribution of the sector/subsector to reduce poverty in the Philippines: \n \nMost of the poor population lives in rural areas. A major component of the current energy sector program in \nPhilippines  is  the  accelerated  electrification  of  rural  areas  to  attain  economic  and  social  development.  The \nelectrification program will be undertaken mainly through rehabilitation and extension of distribution lines including \ninstallation of substations. For areas far from the grids, a program of off-grid new and renewable energy systems will \nbe fully implemented to electrify the rest of the villages and households. With access to electricity, the rural poor will \nenjoy better education, entertainment, communication, health, comfort, convenience, and productivity. In particular, \nthe development of livelihood projects is critical for sustaining of such electrification projects, as the livelihood projects \nwill improve the income generation capacity of the rural households so they can pay for the electricity. \n \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis        Proposed Classification: Other \nAnalysis: \n \nElectricity is an input to most economic processes, and thus is an important ingredient of economic development that \nis essential for poverty alleviation. The proposed Project will help provide an adequate and reliable electricity supply \nto satisfy the forecast electricity demand, including the accelerated rural electrification initiatives. Although the impact \non poverty reduction cannot be quantified, the lower power tariff and application of lifeline rate will benefit the poor \nconsumers. Upgrading the Luzon transmission lines and expansion the Mindanao substations will help meet the \nadditional power demand in their service areas and ensure the rural electrification that will benefit the poor directly \nand indirectly.

Introduction \n1.  The Project consists of Part A\u2013procuring and installing the hardware and software for the \nwholesale  electricity  spot  market  (WESM),  and  Part  B\u2013upgrading  Luzon  transmission  and \nexpanding of Mindanao substations. As Part A has no environmental implications, this summary \ninitial environmental examination discusses only the environmental impacts of Part B. \n \n2.  Upgrading the Luzon transmission is exempted from environmental examination, by the \nEnvironment Management Bureau of the Department of Environment and Natural Resources \n(DENR)  as  it  only  involves  upgrading  existing  230  kV  overhead  transmission  lines  and \nassociated substations. DENR\u2019s certificate of non coverage (CNC) was issued on 16 June \n1999. DENR issued the certificate for expanding the Mindanao substations on 31 January 2000 \nas it only involves installing additional power circuit breakers and transformers within existing \nsubstations. \n \n3.  Nevertheless, an environmental examination was carried out, including (i) a study of the \nproject  features,  facilities,  construction  activities,  and  operational  characteristics,  (ii) \nidentification  of  the  types  and  relative  magnitudes  of  potential  environmental  impacts  with \nconcerned  DENR  regional  offices  and  stakeholders,  (iii)  establishment  of  environmental \nbaselines through primary and secondary data gathering, (iv) assessment of impacts, and (v) \nformulation of protection measures and a monitoring plan. The Asian Development Bank\u2019s \n(ADB\u2019s) social development and resettlement specialist inspected the entire easement of the \nLuzon  transmission  upgrading  in  April  1999  and  again  in  May  2002.  In  addition,  ADB\u2019s \nenvironment specialist reinspected the easement in project areas in May 1999, and met with \nNational Transmission Corporation (TRANSCO) staff to update the current environmental and \nsocial status of the project sites in April 2002. \n \nB.  Description of the Environment \n1.  Physical Environment \n4.  Luzon Transmission Upgrading. This component will use the existing right-of-way \n(ROW). The transmission lines will pass through the central Luzon plain, which consists mostly \nof alluvial deposits from the Pampanga and Bulacan rivers. The area has been covered by a \nthin layer of volcanic ash from the 1991 eruption of Mt. Pinatubo. However, the ROW is not \naffected by the lahar flow. \n \n5.  Mindanao  Substation  Expansion.  The  expansion  will  be  done  within  existing \nsubstation  compounds,  which  comprise  cleared  and  graded  land  with  service  roads  and \ndrainage that can accommodate construction and operation of the expanded facilities. \n \n2.  Ecological Environment and Land Use \n6.  Luzon Transmission Upgrading. The upgrading will reinforce and upgrade the 230 \nkilovolt (kV) transmission network in Luzon to facilitate transfer of additional power coming from \nplanned independent power producer generation.  It involves 117 kilometers of double circuit \ntransmission lines between San Manuel, Tarlac and Mexico, Pampanga. Most of the affected \nareas are agricultural lands (rice, sugar cane, trees, and other plants). In the line from San ", "  Appendix 15  63 \nManuel to Concepcion, Pampanga, about 30% of the crops affected are rice and 60% are \nsugarcane. However, in Conception-Mexico line, rice accounts for 80% of the crop. \n \n7.  The  transmission  lines  will  pass  through  rice  fields  from  Mexico,  Pampanga  to \nValenzuela, Bulacan. The area from Mexico to Valenzuela has been cultivated for a long time. \nNo forest or reserve areas are affected by the existing ROW. Freshwater fish, mosquitoes, and \nrice borers and their larvae are the predominant fauna. In recent years, consumption of the \nfreshwater  fish  has  declined  and  is  discouraged  due  to  the  extensive  use  of  chemical \ninsecticides to control the insect population. \n \n8.  Mindanao Substation Expansion. Unused areas in the substations are covered with \ngravel to control weeds and grass. Grass that penetrates the gravel cover is removed manually \nbecause the grass and weeds are potential fire hazards. The area is fenced and a buffer zone is \nmaintained around the perimeter. Fauna within the substations is composed primarily of small \ninsects and birds. \n \n3.  Socioeconomic Environment \n9.  In 2002 socioeconomic surveys were conducted through an interview of 1,629 affected \nhouseholds.  The  affected  household  heads  have  diverse  occupations.  About  29%  are \nconstruction workers comprising masons, laborers, carpenters, and painters, and another 19% \nare  transport  workers  comprising  drivers  and  helpers.  The  sales  workers  and  agricultural \nworkers follow with 12% and 11% respectively. Other occupational groups include service \nworkers, self-employed individuals, overseas contract workers. About 30% of the households \nearn P3,000 per month and below. Another 30% earn P3,001 to P6,000 per month, and the \nremainder earn above P6,001 per month. Most of the households (94%) own the house they \noccupy. In terms of lots occupancy, only 13% of the households own the lots where their houses \nare built. About 47% are occupying the lots with consent of owners and the remaining 40% are \nsquatters. \n \nC.  Screening of Potential Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n \n1.  Physical Environment \n10.  Luzon Transmission Upgrading. The impacts on the physical environment will be \ntemporary,  reversible,  and  mostly  related  to  the  dust,  noise,  and  vibration  during \ndecommissioning and dismantling of the existing transmission towers and the erection of new \ntowers.  The  best  known  practices  for  minimizing  and  mitigating  these  impacts  will  be \nimplemented, including restriction of working hours in populated areas to minimize noise and \nvibration, and dust mitigation by watering roads and other significant sources of dust. \n \n11.  Mindanao  Substation  Expansion. The impact on the physical environment will be \nminimal and mostly related to the noise and dust generated during the erection of the new \nsubstation equipment. Mitigation measures to be implemented are as described in para. 10. \n \n2.  Ecological Environment\u2013Terrestrial Ecology \n12.  Luzon Transmission Upgrading. Some sections of the ROW will be temporarily used \nto haul heavy equipment. The land will be compacted from the load of the trucks and heavy \nequipment. Rice cannot be cultivated in areas affected during construction. After construction, \nthe land will be loosened and compost spread over it to restore fertility. The discarded old ", "64  Appendix 15 \ntransmission lines and materials will be properly treated for reuse. The old substation equipment \nwill  be  examined  for  polychlorinated  biphenyls  (poisonous  organic  chemicals),  which  were \ncommonly  used  for  electrical  and  heat  insulation  in  older  substations.  If  polychlorinated \nbiphenyls are found, the equipment will be wrapped and sealed for special storage within the \nsubstation until facilities are available in the Philippines to treat such wastes. \n \n13.  Mindanao  Substation  Expansion.  This  component  will  have  no  impact  on  the \nenvironment. No new access roads will be built. The sites for the additional circuit breakers and \ntransformers  have  been  kept  cleared  since  the  substations  were  installed.  The  replaced \nequipment will be examined, and if polychlorinated biphenyls are found, the equipment will be \nwrapped and sealed for special storage within the substation until facilities are available in the \nPhilippines to treat such wastes. \n \n3.  Resettlement Issues \n \n14.  Although upgrading of the Luzon transmission will use the existing ROW, it involves land \nacquisition  and  resettlement  action  for  transmission  tower  foundation  footing  sites  and \nclearance of structures built within the ROW. On the basis of the feedback received from the \naffected communities and the results of the socioeconomic surveys, TRANSCO has prepared a \nresettlement  plan  for  Luzon  transmission  upgrading  in  order  to  facilitate  the  payment  of \nrelocation and compensation. The ADB conducted field inspections, and made appropriate \nrecommendations to TRANSCO concerning implementation of the plan. A summary of the \nresettlement plan is included in Appendix 16. \n \nD.  Institutional Requirement and Environmental Monitoring Program \n \n15.  Through  implementation  of  externally  supported  projects,  TRANSCO  has  been \nresponsible for environmental management and monitoring programs and acquired adequate \ncapacity and human resources for them. The environmental management plan for the Project \ncovers  the  two  components,  for  upgrading  Luzon  transmission  and  expanding  Mindanao \nsubstations. The plan aims to ensure strict implementation of the proposed environmental \nmanagement measures and to safeguard the affected provinces against potential impacts. \n \n16.  Environmental impacts were identified after evaluating the activities that will transpire in \nall project stages, identifying the areas to be affected, and examining their condition. The \nProject\u2019s impacts were then assessed based on experience with similar projects. Management \nmeasures adopted for the Project include those already applied and proven effective in past \nTRANSCO projects. Environmental management measures recommended are as follows: \n \n(i)  Civil  works  guidelines  and  occupational  and  public  health  and  safety \nguidelines.  These  were  formulated  to  direct  the  contractor\u2019s  social  and \nenvironmental  responsibilities  and  will  manage  impacts  associated  with  civil \nworks. \n \n(ii)  Reforestation program. TRANSCO will plant 10 trees for every tree to be cut, \nand this will be coordinated with village captains to determine erosion-prone \nareas in their villages. \n \n(iii)  Environmental  monitoring  plan.  Environmental  monitoring  is  necessary  to \ncheck  whether  environmental  measures  recommended  by  TRANSCO  are \nproperly  implemented  during  the  project  construction.  It  will  also  check ", "  Appendix 15  65 \ncompliance of the contractor with the guidelines to ensure that the environmental \nmanagement  plan  is  carried  out  effectively.  TRANSCO\u2019s  Environmental \nManagement Department, Social Engineering Department, and the project office \nwill jointly implement the recommended environmental management measures \nand  ensure  that  they  are  effective  and  complied  with.  The  contractor\u2019s \nresponsibilities include compliance with the agreed contract with TRANSCO and \ncontrol of its workforce. The pollution control officer will be responsible for overall \nmonitoring  of  the  Project\u2019s  compliance  with  the  environmental  policies, \nenvironmental compliance certificate conditions, and DENR air and water quality \nstandards.  \n \nE.  Findings and Recommendations   \n17.  On the basis of the initial environmental assessment findings, the Luzon transmission \nupgrading and Mindanao substation expansion will not affect any environmentally sensitive \nareas  and  will  exert  a  neutral  or  only  very  small  influence  on  the  environment.  Detailed \nenvironmental impact assessment is not required. Starting with the identified environmental \nimpacts, TRANSCO will incorporate mitigation and environmental management proposals and \nrecommendations for implementation in the Project.   \n \nF.  Conclusion \n18.  Based  on  the  assessment  of  the  environmental  and  socioeconomic  aspects  of  the \nProject  and  because  TRANSCO  has  agreed  to  meet  the  commitments  described,  all \nenvironmental, occupational, health, safety, and socioeconomic impacts of the Project can be \nmanaged  to  levels  that  fully  comply  with  all  applicable  international  guidelines  and  the \nrequirements of the ADB and DENR.  \n \n ", "66  Appendix 16 \n \nSUMMARY RESETTLEMENT PLAN \n \nA.  Background \n \n1.  The  Luzon  transmission  upgrading  component  consists  of  constructing  of  117.08 \nkilometers of transmission lines and will require acquiring land affected by towers and removing \nall houses within the 40 meter (m) right-of-way (ROW). To regulate the compensation and \nresettlement  for  the  component  a  full  resettlement  plan  has  been  prepared  by  National \nTransmission Corporation (TRANSCO), the executing agency of the Project. The resettlement \nplan, field visits, and consultation with TRANSCO and affected families form the basis for this \nsummary.  \n \n2.  As a precondition for project appraisal, this resettlement plan was prepared based on \ndetailed measurement survey and on a compensation framework in accordance with Philippine \nregulations (RA 8674), and Asian Development Bank (ADB) policy on involuntary resettlement \nas detailed in the ADB Handbook on Resettlement: A Guide to Good Practice. The delivery of \ncompensation  and  the  implementation  of  the  resettlement  program  including  houses \nreconstruction will be a condition for contract awards.  \n \nB.  Resettlement Policy, Eligibility, and Entitlements \n3.  The resettlement plan outlines basic policy principles. These are (i) negative impacts will \nbe minimized as much as possible, (ii) resettlement/compensation will be carried out so as to \nimprove  or  at  least  restore  the  affected  people\u2019s  pre-project  living  standards,  (iii)  affected \npersons  will  be  thoroughly  informed  and  consulted  on  compensation  options  and  the \nresettlement plan's design, (iv) affected assets will be compensated at replacement cost, and (v) \ncompensation and resettlement subsidies will be provided in full prior to ground leveling and \ndemolition. \n \n4.  The resettlement plan also stipulates eligibility and entitlement provisions for project-\naffected  people  losing  land,  houses,  and  income,  and  provides  rehabilitation  subsidies. \nPermanent land losses will be compensated in cash at market rates. House losses will be \ncompensated in cash at replacement rates free of demolition expenses and salvaged materials. \nCrops losses will be compensated in cash at market rates. Affected families will also receive \nvarious subsidies, including: a disturbance compensation subsidy of P10,500 for all resettled \naffected families;  resettlement financial assistance of P27,850 for all affected families losing \nhouses, and when applicable a business loss allowance covering business losses based on tax \ndeclarations  or  on  a  fixed  daily  allowance  of  P200  for  the  number  of  days  of  business \ninterruption caused by the Project. \n \nC.  Impacts Assessment  \n5.  The Luzon transmission upgrading will involve constructing 303 towers, causing land \nimpacts that are widespread but of very small magnitude (no affected families will lose more \nland than one tower base of 225 to 400 square meters). Permanent land impacts are 6.8 \nhectares (ha) of farmland and temporary losses are 413.8 ha. Of these, 213.0 ha are occupied \nby rice, 110.7 ha by sugar cane, 66.0 by corn, and 24.1 by trees. In addition, 299 houses and 92 \nminor structures will be demolished within the ROW of the transmission lines. Construction of \nthe transmission lines will affect 1,535 landowners. Permanent land impacts will affect 2,391 \nfamilies  (11,955  people)  of  which  187  families  (935  people)  are  tenants.  Temporary  land ", "  Appendix 16  67 \nimpacts will affect 1,334 families (5,830 people) of which 168 (840 people) are tenants. House \nloss/relocation will affect 321 families (1,605 people); loss of minor structures will affect 46 \nfamilies (230 people), and loss of crops/trees will affect 1,535 families (7675 people). About 70 \nsmall businesses will also be affected. \n \nD.  Public Consultation and Disclosure \n \n6.  The resettlement plan was prepared by TRANSCO through a wide consultative process \nincluding  surveys  and  public  meetings.  The  public  meetings  involved  all  concerned  local \ngovernment units (LGUs), relevant regional development councils, and representatives of the \naffected families. \n \n7.  A project primer has been distributed in July 2002 to all affected families and LGUs \ninforming them of the project\u2019s technical aspects, compensation policy and procedures. The \nresettlement plan will be disclosed in all affected LGUs, at project offices, and at ADB through \nthe ADB website. \n \nE.   Institutional Responsibilities \n8.  TRANSCO has overall responsibility for the land acquisition and resettlement program \nincluding planning, implementation, and financial tasks. Preparation, survey and monitoring \ntasks will reside with TRANSCO\u2019s Social Engineering and ROW Management Department. \nProject offices, in collaboration with LGUs, will be responsible for actual implementation work in \nthe field, including consultation with stakeholders, final identification of affected families and \ndelivery of compensation. \n \nF.  Grievance Procedures \n \n9.    Complaints  and  grievance  procedures  are  established  in  the  resettlement  plan. \nGrievances will be first lodged with local project offices. In the absence of agreement, the \ncomplaints will be addressed to the village-level authorities with further possibility of elevating \nthe  case  to  the  Land  and  Land  Rights  Department  of  TRANSCO  and,  eventually,  to  the \nappropriate civil courts. \n \nG.   Monitoring and Evaluation \n \n10.  TRANSCO will establish a monthly reporting system involving project staff, LGUs, and \naffected families. External monitoring will be assigned to an independent agency tasked with the \nverification of internal monitoring results and the evaluation of the resettlement program at the \nend of the Project. Internal monitoring reports will be sent quarterly to ADB. External monitoring \nreports will be submitted to ADB twice a year until the end of the resettlement program. The \nexternal monitoring agency will also prepare a final evaluation report to be submitted to ADB 3 \nmonths before the loan closing date. \n \nJ.  Finances \n \n11.  Resettlement and land acquisition costs for the project are estimated at P195 million, \nincluding  land  and  buildings  compensation,  resettlement  assistance,  management  costs, \nmonitoring, and taxes. Costs will be adjusted annually based on the previous years' inflation \nrate. \n "], "metadata": {"Creator": "R328-02 - Microsoft Word", "CreationDate": "D:20021129113214Z", "Title": "R328-02", "Author": "rsa", "Producer": "Acrobat PDFWriter 4.0 for Windows NT", "ModDate": "D:20030205152103+08'00'"}}
