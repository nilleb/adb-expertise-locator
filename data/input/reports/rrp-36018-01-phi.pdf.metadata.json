An  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE)  was \nundertaken, and the summary IEE is a core appendix. \n \nThe  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  is  supporting  the  Philippine \nGovernment's plans to restructure and privatize the electric power \nindustry,  and  create  a  competitive  wholesale  electricity  spot \nrequirements  of  a  competitive \nmarket \n(WESM). \nfunctional  wholesale  market \nelectricity  market \nmanagement  system  and  adequate  transmission  capacity.  With \nthe  implementation  of  a  WESM,  competition  in  the  power  sector \nwill  bring  electricity  prices  closer  to  marginal  cost  in  the  medium \nand long term. All of the transmission components included in the \nproposed  Project  are  also  of  high-priority  for  the  National \nTransmission Corporation (TRANSCO) as defined in its least-cost \ntransmission  development  plan.  In  particular,  the  substation \nexpansion  will  enable  completion  of  rural  electrification  programs \nin  Mindanao,  one  of  the  poorest  regions  in  the  Philippines.  The \nProject  fits  into  ADB's  country  operational  strategy  for  the \nPhilippines. \n \nThe  Project  will  support  the  Government\u2019s  objective  to  improve \nthe  accessibility,  quality,  affordability,  and  sustainability  of  the \nnational  electricity  supply  by  (i)  facilitating  the  establishment  of  a \nspot  market  so  that  electricity  generation  is  dispatched  on  a \ncompetitive basis to meet the power demand at a lower cost, and \n(ii)  reinforcing  and  upgrading  the  critical  transmission  lines  and \nsubstations  in  Luzon  and  Mindanao  to  ensure  a  reliable  power \nsupply and provide capacity for rural electrification.  \n \nThe  Project  consists  of  two  parts.  Part  A  includes  procurement \nand installation of the WESM market management hardware, with \nsoftware  and  system  integration  including  consultancy  services. \nPart  B  includes  (i)  upgrading  the  Luzon  transmission  grid  [about \n80 kilometers (km) of 230 kilovolts (kV) double circuit transmission \nlines from  San  Manuel  in  Pangasinan  Province  to  Concepcion  in \nTarlac  Province  and  37  km  of  double  circuit  transmission  lines, \nfrom Concepcion to Mexico in Pampanga Province and substation \nexpansions],  and \nthe  Mindanao  substation \n(procurement  and  installation  of  additional  power  transformers \nand  power circuit  breakers  at  the  Bislig,  Butuan,  Davao,  Kibawe, \nSta. Clara, and Tindalo substations). \n \n\n(ii)  expanding \n\n\fii \n\n \nCost Estimates \n\n \nFinancing Plan \n\n \nThe  total  cost  of  the  Project,  including  physical  and  price \ncontingencies,  and  interest  during  construction,  is  estimated  at \n$106.0  million  equivalent,  including  a  foreign  exchange  cost  of \n$85.5 million and a local currency cost of $20.5 million equivalent. \n \nThe  ADB  loan  of  $40.0  million  will  finance  part  of  the  foreign \nexchange cost, or 38% of the total project costs. The Japan Bank \nfor International Cooperation (JBIC) will cofinance the foreign cost \nof the Project through an untied loan of $45.5 million. TRANSCO \nwill  allocate  $20.5  million,  or  20%  of  the  total  project  costs,  to \nmeet the counterpart funding requirements. \n \n\n \nLoan Amount and Terms  A loan of $40.0 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources will \nbe  provided  under  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR) \nbased lending facility. The loan will have a 20-year term including \na  grace  period  of  6  years,  an  interest  rate  determined  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based \nfacility,  a \ncommitment charge of 0.75% per annum, a front-end fee of 1.0%, \nand  such  other  terms  and  conditions  as  are  set  forth  in  the  draft \nLoan Agreement. \n \nUntil 30 June 2009 \n \n31 December 2008 \n\nlending \n\n \nPeriod of Utilization \n \nEstimated Project \nCompletion Date \n \nExecuting Agency \n \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\n \nProcurement \n\n \n\n \nTRANSCO \n \nTRANSCO  has  appointed  a  project  director  and  a  sufficient \nnumber  of  suitably  qualified  and  experienced  staff,  and  sufficient \nresources to adequately monitor and coordinate the Project.  \n \n \nProcurement for all components will be carried out in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. For Part A of the Project, \na  turnkey  contract  will  be  awarded  using  international  shopping. \nUnder  Part  B,  a  turnkey  contract  will  be  awarded  for  the  Luzon \ntransmission  upgrading  using  international  competitive  bidding \n(ICB)  procedures.  Such  procedures  will  also  be  used  for  the \nsupply  and  delivery  of  materials  and  equipment  for  Mindanao \nsubstations expansion. Civil works will be undertaken and funded \nby  TRANSCO  using  standard \nlocal  competitive  bidding \nprocedures  of  the  Borrower  and  TRANSCO  provided  that  these \nprocedures will fulfill its general obligation to cause the project to \nbe carried out with due diligence and efficiency, and in conformity \nwith sound engineering or other appropriate practices. \n \n \n\n\fConsulting Services \n\n \nProject Benefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\n \nRisks and Assumptions \n\n \n\n \n\nAbout 48 person-months of international and 24 person-months of \ndomestic consulting services will be required for management and \nimplementation  supervision.  The  consultants  will  be  selected  by \nTRANSCO  using  quality-and-cost-based  selection  based  on  full \ntechnical  proposals  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the \nUse of Consultants.  \n \nWith  the introduction  of WESM,  generation  will be  dispatched  on \nthe  basis  of  prices  bid  into  the  market,  with  the  lowest  price \ngenerator  being  dispatched  first.    In  this  way,  for  each  trading \nperiod,  the  price  of  electricity  bought  and  sold  on  the  wholesale \nmarket will be set by the electricity demand and the prices bid by \ncompeting  generators  to  supply  energy  into  the  market.    Initially, \ngiven  the  surplus  of  generation  connected  to  the  grid,  wholesale \nelectricity  prices  are  expected  to  decline.    Over  time,  as  the \nsurplus  generation  is  absorbed,  prices  can  be  expected  to  rise \ncloser  to  the  long  run  marginal  cost  of  electricity  generation, \nproviding  economic  signals  to  encourage  efficient  investment  in \nnew generation. \n \nUpgrading  the  Luzon  transmission  line  capacities  will  enable \npower  from  plants  in  northern  Luzon  to  be  transmitted  efficiently \nand reliably to the main load centers in and around Metro Manila. \nExpansion  of \nthe \nthe  Mindanao  substations  will \nsubstation  capacities,  thereby  assuring  efficient  and  reliable \ndelivery of power to customers in rural areas in particular.  \n \n \nSome  risks  are  associated  with  the  proposed  Project,  and \nmeasures  are  included  to  minimize  their  occurrence  and  effect. \nThe design of the WESM in the Philippines has taken into account \nthe lessons learned in developing electricity markets in other parts \nof  the  world.  The  technical  risks  associated  with  the  proposed \ntransmission \nconsidered \nmanageable  because  the  design  and  construction  are  based  on \nconventional and proven technologies.  \n \n \n\ndevelopment \n\ncomponents \n\nincrease \n\nare \n\n\fTechnical Assistance \n\niv \n\n \n \n\nAdvisory technical assistance (TA) amounting to $800,000 will be \nprovided by ADB from its TA funding program  as a grant to help \nthe Department of Energy facilitate the transition from the current \nregulated  market  to  a  competitive  electricity  market.  Specifically, \nthe  TA  will  (i)  prepare  the  bid  documents  for  the  market \nmanagement  system  and  assist  with  bid  evaluation,  (ii)  provide \nindependent  advice  to  the  Government  prior  to  and  during  the \ninitial implementation of the WESM, (iii) develop a transition plan \nfor  the  selection  of  an  independent  market  operator  (IMO)  for \nWESM, (iv) conduct an industry consultation process in relation to \nthe appointment of the IMO, (v) prepare tender documents for the \nselection  of  the  IMO,  and  (vi)  assist  in  the  bid  evaluation  and \ncontract  negotiations.  Consultancy  services  will  be  required  in \npower  markets,  regulation,  and  information  technology.  The \nservices  will  be  coordinated  by  a  team  leader.  About  16  person-\nmonths  of \ninternational  and  4  person-months  of  domestic \nconsultants  will  be  required.  The  consultants  will  be  selected \nusing  quality-and-cost-based  selection  based  on  full  technical \nproposals  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants.  \n \n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n\fvi \n\n\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n1. \nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the National Power Corporation (NPC), to be guaranteed by the Republic of the Philippines \n(the  Government),  for  the  Electricity  Market  and  Transmission  Development  Project  (the \nProject).  The  report  also  describes  proposed  technical  assistance  (TA)  to  assist  the \nGovernment  in  the  transition  to  competitive  electricity  market,  and  if  the  Board  approves  the \nproposed loan, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, will approve the TA. \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\n2. \nThe  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  has  had  a  long  involvement  in,  and  is  highly \nsupportive  of,  the  Government's  plans  to  restructure  and  privatize  the  electric  power  industry, \nand  create  a  competitive  electricity  market.  Such  restructuring  is  in  conformity  with  ADB's \nEnergy Policy,1 and is a vehicle to help overcome many of the current problems of the sector. \nThe appraisal mission2 was fielded during 22 July to 9 August 2002 to determine the scope of \nthe  Project  on  the  basis  of  the  preparatory  work  of  the  earlier  proposed  transmission \ninterconnection  and  reinforcement  project  (TIRP).3   Three  components  of  the  TIRP  are  now \nincluded  in  the  proposed  Project  because  their  implementation  cannot  be  deferred  further  as \nthey  are  critical  to  avoid  disruptions  in  the  transmission  system  and  for  the  creation  of  a \ncompetitive market. In line with the Government\u2019s least-cost transmission development plan, the \nProject will also enable implementation of accelerated rural electrification programs, particularly \nin Mindanao, one of the poorest regions in the Philippines. The Project fits into ADB's country \noperational strategy  for  the  Philippines.  The  project  framework  is  attached  as  Appendix  1  and \nthe chronology of project processing is in Appendix 2. \n \nA. \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n1. \n\nEnergy Sector \n\n3. \nBeing  highly  dependent  on  imported  energy,  the  Philippines  has  to  contend  with  price \nfluctuations  in  international  energy  markets.  As  such,  exploration  for  and  development  of \nindigenous  energy  resources  to  enhance  self-sufficiency  has  been  a  continuing  thrust  of  the \nGovernment  since  the  oil  crisis  of  the  1970s.  In  addition  to  the  increasing  use  of  indigenous \ncoal, oil, geothermal, and hydro resources, the development of the Malampaya gas field and the \nsuccessful commissioning of natural-gas fired power stations in 2002 has significantly increased \nthe  country\u2019s  energy  self-sufficiency  ratio  to  more  than  50%  from  44%  in  2001.  Increased \nemphasis has recently been given to the use of new and renewable energy resources such as \nwind, solar, and mini-hydro, which are expected to be increasingly used to generate electricity in \nremote areas. \n \n\n                                                 \n1    ADB, 2000. Energy 2000: Review of the Energy Policy of the Asian Development Bank, Manila \n2   The  Mission  consisted  of  Yongping  Zhai  (Energy  Specialist  -  Mission  Leader),  F.  Cleo  Kawawaki  (Commercial \nCofinancing  Officer),  Toru  Hayakawa  (Financial  Analyst),  Xinning  Jia  (Project  Economist),  Elsie  L.  P.  Araneta \n(Project Counsel), Yue-lang Feng (Senior Environment Specialist), L. Blanchetti-Revelli (Social Development and \nResettlement Specialist), and M. Minc (Senior Portfolio Management Specialist). \n\n3   The TIRP included Leyte-Mindanao Interconnection as its major component and three other components, i.e. (i) \nLuzon  transmission  upgrading,  (ii)  Mindanao  substation  expansion,  and  (iii)  power  trading  and  pooling  system. \nThe processing of the TIRP was suspended after loan appraisal due to the Government\u2019s decision to seek private \nsector financing for the Leyte-Mindanao Interconnection. The implementation of the other three components was \nalso deferred pending the finalization of National Power Corporation\u2019s privatization plan. \n\n\f2 \n\n(DOE) \n\nformulates  policies \n\nThe  Department  of  Energy \n\nthe  planning  and \n4. \nimplementation  of  a  comprehensive  program  for  the  efficient  supply  and  economical  use  of \nenergy  consistent  with  the  approved  national  economic  plan  and  with  the  policies  on \nenvironmental  protection.  The  program  provides  a  mechanism \nintegration, \nrationalization,  and  coordination  of  the  Government\u2019s  energy  projects.  In  particular,  the  DOE \nprepares  annually  the  Philippine  Energy  Plan  (PEP),  which  provides  for  the  integrated  and \ncomprehensive  exploration,  development,  utilization,  distribution,  and  conservation  of  energy \nresources, with a preferential bias for environment-friendly, indigenous, and low-cost sources of \nenergy. \n \n\nthe \n\nfor \n\nfor \n\n2. \n\nElectricity Subsector \n\nPrior  to  the  ongoing  power  sector\u2019s  restructuring,  power  generation  functions  in  the \n5. \nPhilippines  were  shared  between  the  NPC  and  several  independent  power  producers  (IPPs) \nwith  contracts  to  sell  electricity  to  NPC  and  Manila  Electric  Company  (MERALCO).  The \ntransmission functions were carried out by NPC. Distribution was carried out by MERALCO, 16 \nprivately  owned  utilities,  7  municipal  systems,  and  119  member-owned  electric  cooperatives \nthat manage retail sales mostly in rural areas. NPC was also engaged in the direct sale of bulk \nelectricity to large industrial customers.  \n \nThe  total  installed  generating  capacity  at  the  end  of  2001,  excluding  the  small  island \n6. \ngrids,  amounted  to  13,459  megawatts  (MW)  consisting  of  71%  in  Luzon,  14%  in  the  Visayas, \nand 15% in Mindanao. The generation mix comprised 19% hydropower, 14% geothermal, 28% \ncoal-based thermal, and 39% oil-based thermal plants.   \n \n7. \nAs  of  December  2001,  the  transmission  system  had  a  substation  capacity  of  22,390 \nmegavolt amperes (MVA), of which 83% is in Luzon, 10% in the Visayas, and 7% in Mindanao. \nIts transmission lines of various voltages extend up to 30,373 circuit-kilometers (km), of which \n66% is in Luzon, 15% in the Visayas, and 19% in Mindanao.  \n \n8. \nAs  part  of  the  PEP,  the  Power  Development  Plan  (PDP)  and  the  Transmission \nDevelopment Plan (TDP) are prepared by DOE on the basis of the power demand projections. \nAs  the  current  surplus generating capacity  will  be  gradually  absorbed  by  the  growing  demand \naround  2005,  the  PDP  provides  for  a  net  capacity  addition  of  about  11,600  MW  up  to  2011. \nAccordingly, the TDP envisages an addition of 11,376 km of transmission and subtransmission \nlines  and  22,450  MVA  of  substation  capacity.  Aside  from  the  new  transmission  projects,  the \nTDP also incorporates rehabilitation and upgrading works to ensure the reliability of the existing \nnetworks.  \n \n \n \n9. \nInadequate basic  infrastructure,  including  roads  and  electricity  facilities,  has  limited  the \ndevelopment of rural areas. By the end of 2001, electrification at village level was 82%, leaving \nabout  7,000  villages  unelectrified.  About  80%  of  the  households  in  unelectrified  villages  are \nbelow  the  poverty  threshold  level  of  annual  income  of  P55,470  (in  2000  prices)  or  $1,073. \nAccess  to  electricity  is  uneven;  close  to  half  the  households  in  the  lowest  40%  income  group \nlack  access  to  electricity  as  compared  to  9  out  of  10  households  in  the  highest  60%  income \ngroup  having  access.  In  Mindanao,  even  the  non-poor  have  a  relatively  low  level  of  coverage \nindicating that access rather than affordability is the issue. \n \n\nPoverty Issues and the Sector \n\n3. \n\n\f3 \n\nThe  Government  has  an  accelerated  rural  electrification  program  that  targets  the \n10. \nelectrification of all villages by 2006. Parallel with electrification efforts, the Government aims to \nreduce poverty in the areas to be electrified by promoting income-generating activities that may \nbe introduced following electrification. The cost of rural electrification is relatively high due to the \npredominantly  residential  customer  profile,  low  per  capita  electricity  consumption,  and  high \nsystem  losses.  For  this  reason,  a  number  of  provisions  have  been  made  to  benefit  rural \ncustomers.  One  such  provision  is  the  village  electrification  fund  established  by  Republic  Act \n7638  of  1998  from  levies  from  power  generation  facilities.  The  fund  partly  finances  village \nelectrification in communities hosting these facilities.  \n \n\n4. \n\nExternal Assistance to the Sector \n\nADB  is  the  lead  official  development  partner  in  the  energy  sector,  with  a  focus  on  the \n11. \nelectricity  subsector.  Since  1971,  ADB  has  provided  24  loans  with  a  combined  amount  of \n$2.258  billion  to  help  develop  the  Philippine  energy  sector,  including  19  loans  to  NPC, \nguaranteed  by  the  Republic  of  the  Philippines,  with  a  combined  value  of  $1.557  billion.  In \naddition to its lending, ADB has given 29 technical assistance (TA) grants to the energy sector \ntotaling  $10.7  million  covering  areas  such  as  coal  industry  development,  rural  electrification, \nenergy  conservation,  tariff  and  pricing  studies,  regulation,  consumer  impact  assessment, \ngeothermal  steam  and  natural  gas  pricing  studies,  power  development  planning,  feasibility \nstudies,  and  environmental  assessments.  A  list  of  ADB  assistance  to  the  energy  sector  is  in \nAppendix 3. \n \n12. \nOther  major multilateral and bilateral agencies involved in the sector include the World \nBank, Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC), Export-Import Bank of the United States \n(US), US Agency for International Development (USAid), US Trade and Development Agency, \nKreditanstalt  f\u00fcr  Wiederaufbau  (KfW),  Organization  of  Petroleum  Exporting  Countries  (OPEC) \nFund,  and  Kuwait  Fund.  ADB  has  been  coordinating  its  assistance  to  the  sector  with  other \nagencies,  in  particular  the  World  Bank  and  JBIC.  Annual  consultation  meetings  are  held \nbetween ADB and JBIC to coordinate cofinancing activities.   \n \n\n5. \n\nLessons Learned \n\n13. \nOf the 19 ADB loans to NPC, 18 projects have been physically completed and 8 of these \nhave been subjected to post evaluation review. Five post evaluated projects were found to be \ngenerally  satisfactory  and  the  other  three,  partly  satisfactory. 4  The  principal  problems \nencountered were front-end delays, mainly because of protracted procurement procedures and \nslow approval of contract awards. To reduce such delays, NPC standardized bidding documents \nand specifications, and formed a project management group headed by a vice president. Loan \ndirectors  assigned  to  this  group  are  appointed  for  all  major  projects  to  ensure  that  project-\nrelated  work  is  properly  coordinated  and  processed  without  undue  delay.  The  project \nperformance  audit  reports  also  highlighted  the  need  to  improve  NPC\u2019s  power  demand \nprojections.  With  the  assistance  of  an  ADB-financed  study, 5 NPC  has  used  advanced  load \nforecasting techniques for preparing its power development plan since 1995. NPC enhanced its \npower  planning  capabilities  in  1997  by  installing  modern  software  capable  of  handling \n\n                                                 \n4    The  partly  satisfactory  loans  were:  Loan  No.  291-PHI,  Fourth  Mindanao  Power  Project,  (implementation  delays \nand  cost  overruns);  Loan  No  326-PHI,  Fifth  Mindanao  Power  Project,  Manila  (implementation  delays  and  cost \noverruns);  and  Loan  No  542-PHI,  Rural  Electrification  Project,  Manila  (implementation  delays  and  withdrawal  of \nsome counterpart financing). \n\n5    ADB. 1993. TA1966-PHI, Long-Term Power System Planning Study, for $600,000 approved on 20 October 1993. \n\nManila. \n\n\f4 \n\ninterconnected  systems  and  environmental  aspects.    Recent  transmission  line  projects  have \nalso  been  delayed  by  problems  in  negotiating  rights-of-way  (ROWs)  for  the  lines.    TRANSCO \nhas  now  established  its  Social  Engineering  Department,  which  is  responsible  for  addressing \nROW  issues  during  the  planning  phase  before  a  project  commences.    This  department  is \nresponsible for preparing a resettlement plan prior to approval of ADB-financed projects. \n \nB. \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\n1. \n\nMajor Problems \n\n14. \nIn  the  early  1990s,  Luzon  experienced  severe  power  shortages,  leading  to  prolonged \nblackouts  and  adverse  impacts  on  the  economy.  With  the  Government\u2019s  support,  NPC  and \nMERALCO contracted IPPs to resolve the power crisis. The East Asian financial crisis starting \nin 1997 suppressed economic growth and reduced electricity demand, leading to surplus power \ngenerating capacity. NPC\u2019s debt service burden has spiraled upwards in recent years due to the \nlack  of  Government  equity  for  capital  expansion  programs,  NPC\u2019s  heavy  reliance  on  debt \nfinance,  and  the  major  depreciation  of  the  peso  against  foreign  currencies  in  NPC\u2019s  debt \nportfolio.  Moreover,  the  IPP  contracts  included  high  cost  premiums  because  of  perceived \ninvestor risks. NPC, in some cases, paid fixed capacity charges to IPPs without availing of the \nelectricity supply. Transmission bottlenecks, caused mainly by delays in obtaining the ROWs for \nconstruction of new lines, together with the excess capacity, have resulted in additional costs. In \nthe  distribution  subsector,  power  losses  are  high,  as  20  electricity  cooperatives  have  system \nlosses in the range of 16% to 20%, and another 24 electric cooperatives have system losses in \nexcess of 20%. A combination of these factors has resulted in Philippine power rates being one \nof the highest among ADB\u2019s developing member economies (Table 1).  \n\n \nTable 1: Comparative Electricity Retail Tariffs in Selected Asian Economies \n(US cents/kWh, as of December 2001) \n \n\nResidential \n11.0-13.9 \n3.7 \n4.8-18.8 \n5.7-7.3 \n11.7 \n1.6-5.5 \n3.2-6.0 \n10.7 \n\nCountry  \nHong Kong, China  \nIndonesia \nRepublic of Korea \nMalaysia \nSingapore \nThailand \nViet Nam \nPhilippines \nSources: ASEAN Center for Energy, Korea Electric Power Corporation (KEPCO), Republic of Korea; China Light and \nPower Group (CLP), Hong Kong, China; Perusahaan Listrik Negara (PLN), Indonesia. \n \n15. \nNPC\u2019s cross-subsidies between grids are significant. From an economic perspective, a \ncomparison  of  NPC's  2001  tariffs  (generation  and  transmission)  against  the  long-run  marginal \ncost (LRMC) 6 reveals that Luzon tariffs were 1.52 times the LRMC, Visayas tariffs 1.33 times, \nand Mindanao tariffs 0.66 times (Table 2).  \n \n\nCommercial \n12.5 \n6.1 \n6.9-8.0 \n4.4-7.5 \n6.9-8.8 \n2.3-2.5 \n6.2 \n10.3 \n\nIndustrial \n8.9 \n4.4 \n2.6-9.1 \n3.9-5.0 \n6.7-8.2 \n2.3-2.5 \n1.4-3.5 \n10.0 \n\n                                                 \n6 The LRMC is the cost of delivering an additional unit of electricity to meet reasonably expected demand, including \ncapital  investment  costs  and  the  variable  costs  of  operation.  When  the  LRMC  is  accurately  reflected  in  energy \nprices,  both  producers  and  customers  will  tend  to  make  optimal  decisions  that  will  ensure  the  sustainable \ndevelopment of the power industry. \n\n\f5 \n\nTable 2: NPC Average Tariffs and Long-Run Marginal Cost (2001) \n \nLuzon \n2.20 \n3.34 \n1.52 \n\nVisayas \n2.43 \n3.22 \n1.33 \n\nMindanao \n2.90 \n1.93 \n0.66 \n\n \nLRMC (P/kWh) \nAverage Tariff (P/kWh) \nTariff/LRMC Ratio \nLRMC=long-run marginal cost. \nSource: National Power Corporation. \n \n\n2. \n\nPower Sector Restructuring Program \n\n16. \nThe particular problems facing the power sector in the Philippines must be addressed if \nan accessible, high quality, affordable, and sustainable electricity supply is to be assured. The \nGovernment has therefore decided to restructure the electric power industry. This restructuring \nis  similar  to  that  undertaken  in  many  other  countries  and  will  involve  (i)  disaggregation  of  the \nindustry into generation, transmission, distribution, and supply, (ii) introduction of competition in \nthe  generation  and  supply  sectors,  (iii)  introduction  of  a  wholesale  electricity  spot  market \n(WESM), (iv) privatization of generation and operation of transmission by a concessionaire, (v) \nintroduction  of  open  access  to  distribution  networks,  and  (vi)  regulation  of  the  industry  by  a \nregulator independent of government.  \n \nRestructuring  of  the  power  sector  has  progressed  along  the  lines  established  by  the \n17. \nElectric Power Industry Reform Act (EPIRA) approved in June 2001. Under the EPIRA, Power \nSector  Assets  and  Liabilities  Management  Corporation  (PSALM)  has  been  established  to \nmanage  the  privatization,  TRANSCO  has  been  constituted  as  a  stand-alone  transmission \norganization,  and  the  independent  Electricity  Regulatory  Commission  (ERC)  has  been \nestablished.    Furthermore,  NPC  has  been  reorganized  in  preparation  for  privatization.  A  final \ndraft  of  the  WESM  rules  has  been  issued  and  the  grid  and  distribution  codes  have  been \npromulgated. The Joint Congressional Power Commission endorsed the PSALM\u2019s privatization \nplan  for  NPC  on  29  August  2002  and  the  President  of  the  Philippines  signed  the  privatization \nplan  on  4  October  2002.  According  to  the  plan,  a  qualified  private  concessionaire  will  be \nselected  in  the  first  half  of  2003  to  operate  TRANSCO\u2019s  transmission  assets.  The  generation \nassets will be privatized through international competitive bidding in the second half of 2003. \n \n18. \nADB  has  actively  supported  power  industry  restructuring.  In  1998,  ADB  approved  the \npower  sector  restructuring  program  (PSRP)  loan  to  the  Republic  of  the  Philippines. 7  The \nprincipal objective of the PSRP is to support the Government\u2019s initiatives to create competitive \nelectricity markets. Despite the challenging reforms required under the PSRP, the Government \nhas made satisfactory progress. The PSRP loan\u2019s first tranche of $100 million was released in \nDecember  1998  following  compliance  with  13  conditions  precedent  to  Board  consideration. \nSince then, ADB has been closely monitoring the implementation of the PSRP, and continuing \npolicy  dialogue  has  been  associated  with  monitoring  progress  on  various  actions  under  the \nPSRP.  The  second  tranche  of  $100  million  was  released  in  December  2001  following \ncompliance  with  6  conditions  and  waiver  of  2  conditions  that  were  partly  complied  with.  The \nlatter  2  conditions  have  since  been  substantially  complied  with.  Of  the  6  third  tranche  release \nconditions,  5  have  been  complied  with,  and  1  substantially  complied  with.  The  release  of  the \nthird tranche of $100 million was approved by the Board on 13 November 2002.8 \n\n                                                 \n7   ADB.  1998.  Loan  1662-PHI:  Power  Sector  Restructuring  Program,  for  $300  million,  approved  on  16  December \n\n8   ADB.  2002.  Progress  Report  on  the  Power  Sector  Restructuring  Program  Progress  Report  (Release  of  Third \n\n1998. Manila. \n\nTranche). November 2002. Manila. \n\n\f6 \n\n3. \n\nProject Rationale \n\n19. \nBy  2011  electricity  demand  is  forecast  to  increase  by  130%  above  current  levels.  \nConsistent with the PEP, continuing reinforcement of the transmission grid is required to support \nthis increased demand.  If such reinforcement does not occur, the quality and sustainability of \nthe electricity supply will deteriorate and transmission losses will increase to uneconomic levels.  \nThe  Project  is  consistent  with  this  required  capacity  augmentation  and,  more  particularly,  with \nADB\u2019s  policy  objectives  in  supporting  the  development  and  restructuring  of  the  Philippines\u2019 \nelectricity industry. \n \n20. \nAn important facet of power sector restructuring is the establishment of the WESM. The \nWESM  will  facilitate  competition  in  electricity  generation.  Under  the  WESM,  each  day  will  be \ndivided  into  24  one-hour  trading  periods.  Generation  will  be  dispatched  on  the  basis  of  prices \nbid into the market, with the lowest price generator being dispatched first. In this way, for each \ntrading period, the price of electricity bought and sold on the wholesale market will be set by the \nelectricity demand and the prices bid by competing generators to supply energy into the market.  \nInitially,  given  the  surplus  of  generation  connected  to  the  grid,  wholesale  electricity  prices  can \nbe  expected  to  decrease.  Over  time,  as  the  surplus  of  generation  is  absorbed,  prices  can  be \nexpected  to  rise  closer  to  the  LRMC  of  electricity  generation,  providing  economic  signals  to \nencourage efficient investment in new generation. \n \n21.  While PSALM has decided to establish a pilot market management system (MMS) in the \nfirst  half  of  2003  to  undertake  initial  market  operations  and  to  train  market  participants,  the \nProject will provide the permanent MMS hardware and software that is necessary to operate a \nfully  functional  WESM.  This  will  be designed  to  allow  for  phased  implementation  so  that  it  will \ninitially support a market with limited functionality, which will not depend on the availability of all \nthe  planned  systems  needed  to  support  fully  automated  market  operation  across  all  three \nTRANSCO grids. As enhancements to the transmission system are completed, the functionality \nof the MMS will be progressively improved. These enhancements are in progress and financed \nby  the  World  Bank.  A  more  detailed  description  of  the  WESM,  and  its  relationship  to  other \nongoing projects, is given in Appendix 4. \n \nA  competitive  wholesale  market  will  be  more  efficient  if  the  transmission  network  has \n22. \nsufficient  capacity  to  transport  the  power  between  the  generators  competing  for  dispatch  and \nthe load. If a transmission network is capacity constrained, cheaper generation may need to be \nreplaced  by  more  expensive  plant  located  closer  to  the  load.  This  will  increase  market  prices \nand reduce the overall effectiveness of the market. The Project will increase the capacity of the \ntransmission  network  by  strengthening  the  existing  230  kilovolt  (kV)  network  to  provide  a \nbackup  transmission  corridor  between  the  generation  in  Northern  Luzon  and  Manila. \nFurthermore,  the  San  Manuel-Concepcion-Mexico  transmission  lines  that  will  be  upgraded \nunder  the  Project  are  hazardous  since  they  no  longer  meet  minimum  ground  clearance \nrequirements due to the impact of the Mt. Pinatubo eruption.  Based on TRANSCO\u2019s load flow \nsimulations, the San Manuel-Concepcion-Mexico transmission lines are sometimes overloaded \neven under normal operating conditions.  \n \n23. \nThe  acceleration  of  rural  electrification,  particularly  in  Mindanao,  is  another  important \npolicy objective. Mindanao contains about 24% of the country\u2019s population, and 38% of its poor. \nOver  50%  of  the  people  in  Mindanao  are  poor,  compared  to  the  national  average  of  34%.  As \nmany  as  62%  of  the  poor  in  Mindanao  have  no  access  to  electricity.  In  view  of  the \nGovernment\u2019s plan for rural electrification and the scheduled commissioning of a new coal-fired \npower  station  in  Mindanao,  six  major  substations  in  Western,  Eastern,  Central,  Northern  and \n\n\f7 \n\nSouthern Mindanao will be expanded to accommodate the increasing power load in their service \nareas.  The  substations  to  be  upgraded  have  been  chosen  because  their  maximum  electricity \ndemands  are  approaching  the  substation  capacities.  The  expansion  of  the  substations  in \nMindanao  will  provide  additional capacity  to  support  the  Government\u2019s  objective  of  electrifying \nall villages by 2006. \n \n\n  \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nObjective \n\n24. \nThe  Project  will  provide  the  system  and  infrastructure  to  support  the  ongoing \ndevelopment of the power sector by (i) providing infrastructure to support the establishment of \nthe  WESM,  which  will  allow  the  privatization  of  electricity  generation  companies  to  meet  the \npower demand at a lower cost, and (ii) reinforcing and upgrading critical transmission lines and \nsubstations in Luzon and Mindanao, which will improve the reliability of the power supply, and \nhelp expand rural electrification.  \n \nB. \n\nComponents and Outputs \n\n25. \nThe  Project  consists  of  two  parts.  Part  A  involves  implementation  of  the  market \nmanagement system (MMS) for the WESM, and integration of the system into the wider WESM \ninfrastructure,  including  consultancy  services.  Part  B  involves  transmission  reinforcement  by \nupgrading the Luzon transmission lines and expanding the Mindanao substations. \n \n\n1. \n\nPart A \u2013 Market Management System for WESM \n\n26. \nThis  component  will  provide  the  computer  hardware  and  software  required  to  manage \nthe bidding, dispatch optimization, and market settlement functions of the WESM. The hardware \nincludes the main servers, application servers, meter data servers, data warehouses, electronic \ncommerce servers, networking equipment, user interface work stations, and backup hardware. \nThe software includes standard and customer-tailored components developed for the Philippine \nWESM, and backup software. Consulting services are required to (i) supervise the performance \nof  the  turnkey  contractor  with  regard  to  software  design  and  hardware  acquisition,  and \nfunctional  testing,  (ii)  perform  quality  control  functions,  (iii)  supervise  and  assist  in  the \ninstallation,  system  integration,  and  commissioning  phases  of  the  subproject,  and  (iv)  provide \nnecessary training. \n \n27. \nThe  DOE  will  constitute  an  autonomous  group  market  operator  (AGMO),  which  will \ninitially  operate  the  market  under  the  administrative  supervision  of  TRANSCO.  In  accordance \nwith  Section  7  of  the  EPIRA,  the  AGMO  will  be  replaced,  within  1  year  of  market  start,  by  an \nindependent  market  operator  (IMO)  that  is  financially  and  technically  capable,  with  proven \nexperience, and with expertise of not less than 2 years as a leading IMO of similar or larger size \nelectricity  markets.  ADB  will  assist  the  AGMO  prepare  for  the  operation  of  the  WESM  and \nsupport the Government in the selection of the IMO through grant-financed TA (paras. 61 and \n62). \n \n\n2. \n\nPart B - Transmission Reinforcement  \n\nLuzon  Transmission  Upgrading.  This  component  consists  of  procuring  and  installing \n28. \nlines  and  substation  equipment  to  reinforce  and  upgrade  the  existing  230  kV  overhead \ntransmission  network  in  Luzon  to  increase  the  transfer  capacities  to  accommodate  the  load \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\ngrowth  in  the  concerned  provinces.  The  San  Manuel-Concepcion  (80  km)  and  Concepcion-\nMexico (37 km) lines will be upgraded from single circuit-single conductor to double circuit-twin \nconductor  (Map  1).    Apart  from  having  low  current  carrying  capacity,  these  lines  have  been  a \nsafety hazard, with many parts of the line too close to the ground.  Furthermore, substations will \nbe upgraded as necessary to support the increased capacity transmission lines. \n\n29.  Mindanao  Substation  Expansion.  This  component  consists  of  procurement  and \ninstallation  of  6  units  of  138/69  kV  power  transformers  with  a  total  capacity  of  525  megavolt-\namperes (MVA), 9 units of 138 kV and 15 units of 69 kV power circuit breakers at Bislig, Butuan, \nDavao,  Kibawe,  Sta.  Clara  and  Tindalo  (Map  2).    This  will  accommodate  increasing  electricity \ndemand  and  support  the  government\u2019s  efforts  to  reduce  poverty  by  increasing  the  capacity  of \nconnections  to  local  distribution  networks.    The  installation  of  a  second  transformer  at  these \nsubstations  should  also  improve  system  reliability.  The  expanded  substation  capacities  will \nconnect about 5,000 households in semi-urban and rural areas to the grid. \n\n \nCost Estimates \n\nC. \n\n30. \nThe  total  cost  of  the  Project,  including  physical  and  price  contingencies,  and  interest \nduring construction, is estimated at $106 million equivalent, including a foreign exchange cost of \n$85.5 million and a local currency cost of $20.5 million equivalent.  Detailed cost estimates are \ngiven in Appendix 5, and are summarized in Table 3. \n \n\nTable 3: Cost Estimates ($ million) \n \n\nComponent \n\nForeign \nExchange \n\nLocal \nCurrency \n\nTotal \nCost \n\n(i)   Hardware and Software \n(ii)  Project Management \n\nPart A: Electricity Market \n \n \nPart B: Transmission Development \n(i)   Luzon Transmission Upgrading \n \n \n(ii)  Mindanao Substation Expansion \nContingencies & Interest During Construction \n \nSource: National Transmission Corporation, Asian Development Bank Estimates \n \nD. \n\n21.0 \n2.0 \n \n26.0 \n11.0 \n25.5 \n85.5 \n\nFinancing Plan \n\nTotal \n\n1.0 \n1.0 \n \n12.0 \n1.5 \n5.0 \n20.5 \n\n22.0 \n3.0 \n \n38.0 \n12.5 \n30.5 \n106.0 \n\n31.  With  the  consent  of  the  Government,  NPC  has  requested  a  loan  of  $40.0  million  from \nADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources to help finance the Project. The loan will have a 20-year term \nincluding  a  grace  period  of  6  years,  an  interest  rate  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nLondon  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)  based  lending  facility,  a  commitment  charge  of  0.75% \nper annum, a front-end fee of 1.0%, and such other terms and conditions as are set forth in the \ndraft  Loan  Agreement.  The  borrower  will  be  NPC  and  the  Republic  of  the  Philippines  will \nguarantee  the  loan.  TRANSCO  will  be  the  executing  agency  of  the  Project.  The  borrower  has \nprovided ADB with (i) the reasons for its decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending \nfacility on the basis of these terms and conditions, and (ii) confirmation that these choices were \nits  own  independent  decision  and  not  made  in  reliance  on  any  communication  or  advice  from \nADB. \n \n\n\f9 \n\nThe ADB loan will finance up to $40 million of the foreign exchange cost, or 38% of the \n32. \ntotal project cost. JBIC has indicated that it will cofinance the foreign cost of the Project through \nan untied loan of $45.5 million.  TRANSCO has made budget provision of about $20.5 million, to \nfinance  the  local  currency  cost  (resettlement,  civil  and  erection  works).

Both  project  components  are  necessary  for  the  successful  privatization  of  NPC\u2019s \nassets,  and  cannot  be  further  delayed  to  wait  for  the  effective  transfer  of  assets  from  NPC  to \nPSALM.    TRANSCO  cannot  be  the  Borrower,  as  the  approved  privatization  plan  requires \nTRANSCO to remain debt free throughout its corporate term. \n \n34. \nNPC\u2019s current charter is contained in Republic Act No 6395, as amended. NPC\u2019s current \nresponsibilities include (i) the development, construction and operation of power generation and \nfacilities  throughout  the  country,  and  (ii)  the  sale  of  electric  power  in  bulk  to  distributors  and \nother  large  electricity  consumers.  It  is  a  stock  corporation  with  all  shares  subscribed  by  the \nGovernment.    NPC\u2019s  corporate  powers  are  vested  in  a  nine  member  Board.  The  secretary  of \nfinance  is  currently  the  chairman  of  the  Board  while  the  secretary  of  energy  is  vice-chairman. \nThe president of NPC is appointed by the President of the Philippines and is also a member of \nthe Board.  \n \nIn accordance with EPIRA provisions, the transfer of all liabilities and non-transmission \n35. \nassets  from  NPC  to  PSALM,  and  all  transmission  and  subtransmission  assets  from  NPC  to \nTRANSCO  is  expected  in  early  2003.  It  can  be  effective  only  after  necessary  consents  are \nobtained from NPC\u2019s bondholders and bank creditors, which include ADB, JBIC and the World \nBank.  Since  the  transfer  of  assets  and  liabilities  is  considered  a  major  change  in  the \nimplementing arrangements of ADB loans to NPC, a Board paper will be submitted to the Board \nfor  consideration  after  the  various  implications  of  the  transfer  have  been  properly  reviewed.  If \nthe Board paper is approved, an omnibus amendment agreement, supplemental to the existing \n                                                 \n9  As of 4th quarter 2002, 12 ADB loan agreements and guarantee agreements remained in force, and a total principal \namount  of  $664.34  million  remained  outstanding  and  unpaid  under  the  loan  agreements,  together  with  interest, \nfees, and charges in amounts calculated in accordance with their provisions. \n\n\f10 \n\nloan  and  guarantee  agreements,  will  be  jointly  signed  by  ADB,  the  Government,  PSALM, \nTRANSCO and NPC. Similar arrangements are being conducted by the Government with JBIC \nand the World Bank for transfer of their respective NPC\u2019s assets and liabilities. \n \nPSALM  was  formally  created  in  June  2001  under  Section  49  of  the  EPIRA  to  manage \n36. \nthe orderly sale, disposition, and privatization of NPC generation assets, real estate and other \ndisposable  assets,  and  IPP  contracts  with  the  objective  of  liquidating  all  NPC  financial \nobligations and stranded contract costs in an optimal manner. According to the EPIRA, PSALM \nwill exist for a period of 25 years, and all assets held by it, all moneys and properties belonging \nto it, and all its liabilities outstanding upon the expiration of its term of existence will revert to and \nbe assumed by the Government. \n \nPrior  to  1997,  energy  sales  increased  at  an  average  annual  rate  of  around  7%-9% \n37. \n(Table  5).  However,  the  financial  crisis  that  affected  the  Asian  region  starting  in  mid-1997 \nresulted  in  slower  growth  of  energy  sales.  While  the  annual  return-on-rate  base  (RORB)  for \n1996 was above the required 8%, it declined to 2.22% in 2000. The debt service coverage ratio \n(DSCR) was 1.56 in 1996, but fell below 1.0 from 1997 to 2001. The power sector restructuring \nwill  address  these  problems.  The  Government  has  assured  that  it  will  provide  PSALM  with \nsufficient funds to maintain a DSCR of 1.0 or above. \n \n\nTable 5: NPC Financial Performance (1996 \u2013 2001) \n \n1997\n36,442\n9.2\n2.12\n77,144\n65,519\n11,625\n3,055\n161,808\n7.18\n0.98\n\n2001\nIndicators \n37,042\nSales (GWh) \n-0.7\nSales Growth (%) \nAverage Rate (P/kWh) \n3.12\n115,698\nOperating Revenue (P million) \n108,860\nOperating Expenditure (P million) \nOperating Income (P million) \n6,838\nNet Income (P million) \n(10,337)\n236,305\nRate Base (P million) \n2.89\nRORB (%) \nDSCR \n0.70\nDSCR=debt  service  coverage  ratio,  GWh  =  gigawatt-hour,  kWh  =  kilowatt-hour,  NPC=National  Power  Corporation, \nRORB = return-on-rate base.  \nSource: National Power Corporation \n \n\n2000 \n37,320 \n0.9 \n2.68 \n100,119 \n94,681 \n5,438 \n(12,964) \n244,756 \n2.22 \n0.74 \n\n1999 \n36,987 \n-0.9 \n2.42 \n89,686 \n81,196 \n8,490 \n(5,952) \n251,989 \n3.37 \n0.92 \n\n1996\n33,381\n7.6\n1.91\n63,635\n50,317\n13,318\n5,543\n161,536\n8.24\n1.56\n\n1998\n37,321\n2.4\n2.32\n86,611\n79,696\n6,915\n(3,617)\n215,053\n3.22\n0.92\n\n2. \n\nThe Executing Agency \n\n38. \nTRANSCO will be the executing agency of the Project. TRANSCO was formally created \nin June 2001 under Section 8 of EPIRA to assume the electrical transmission function of NPC, \nincluding  planning,  construction,  and  centralized  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  of \ntransmission  and  subtransmission  facilities.  TRANSCO\u2019s  organization  structure  is  shown  in \nAppendix 6.  \n \nTRANSCO\u2019s  current  functions  and  responsibilities  include  (i)  operating  the  nationwide \n39. \nelectrical  transmission  and  subtransmission  system,  (ii)  ensuring  the  reliability,  adequacy, \nsecurity, stability, and integrity of the grid, (iii) improving and expanding transmission facilities, \nconsistent with the TDP and the grid code, and (iv) providing central dispatch to all generation \nfacilities and connected loads. \n \n\n\f11 \n\nIn accordance with NPC\u2019s privatization plan, the Government will retain the ownership of \n40. \nTRANSCO  but  its  operations  will  be  leased  to  a  qualified  private  concessionaire  through \ninternational competitive bidding with prequalification. The concessionaire will be responsible for \nthe improvement, expansion, and O&M of the transmission assets. The concession is expected \nto  have  a  period  of  25  years,  which  could  be  renewed  for  another  25  years  subject  to  the \nconcessionaire\u2019s satisfactory performance. Upon the expiration or termination of the concession \ncontract, the transmission facilities and assets will revert to TRANSCO. \n \nTRANSCO  is  not  expected  to  have  any  debt  as  PSALM  will  take  over  all  NPC's \n41. \noutstanding  obligations  (para.  33).  TRANSCO\u2019s  current  transmission  tariffs,  which  were \napproved by ERC in June 2002, form the basis for the financial projections given in Table 6 (for \ndetails,  see  Appendix  7).  In  accordance  with  EPIRA  provisions,  TRANSCO\u2019s  net  profit  will  be \nremitted  to  PSALM.  As  TRANSCO  will  form  an  important  revenue  source  for  PSALM,  it  is \nproposed that, in the event TRANSCO is allowed to incur any debt, TRANSCO shall maintain a \ndebt service coverage ratio of at least 1.0 during the project implementation period and at least \n1.3 thereafter. \n \n\n2002 \n43,982 \n11.3 \n17,012 \n9,520 \n0.56 \n0.39 \n7,393 \n93,594 \n8.01 \n4,863 \n\n2004 \n52,198 \n8.6 \n25,467 \n12,280 \n0.48 \n0.49 \n12,917 \n114,405 \n11.53 \n6,515 \n\nIndicator \nEnergy Volumes (GWh) \nSales Growth (%) \nOperating Revenue (P million) \nOperating Expenditure (P million) \nOperating Ratio (times)  \nAverage Revenue (P/kWh) \nNet Income/(Loss) (P million) \nRate Base (P million) \nRORB (%) \nCash Generation (P million) \n\nTable 6: TRANSCO\u2019s Projected Financial Performance \n \n2003 \n48,081 \n9.3 \n23,483 \n11,057 \n0.47 \n0.49 \n12,310 \n101,081 \n12.29 \n5,486 \n\n2005 \n56,930 \n9.1 \n27,725 \n13,888 \n0.50 \n0.49 \n13,486 \n132,048 \n10.48 \n8,009 \nGWh=Gigawatt-hour, RORB=return-on-rate base, ADB=Asian Development Bank. \nSource: National Transmission Corporation, Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n42. \nThe  IMO  will  be  responsible  for  operating  the  WESM  and  will  be  an  independent  and \nautonomous  entity.  After  it  is  formed,  it  will  assume  the  functions,  assets,  and  liabilities  of  the \nAGMO.  The  cost  of  administering  and  operating  the  WESM  will  be  recovered  through  market \ncharges imposed on all WESM participants. For this analysis, it is assumed that the WESM will \nbe  introduced  only  in  the  Luzon  electricity  market.  The  structure  of  market  charges  will  be \ntransparent and filed with and approved by the ERC. Market charges used here are estimated \nby TRANSCO.

It  has  also  provided  the  project  director  with  a  sufficient  number  of  suitably \nqualified  and  experienced  staff,  including  accounting  staff  and  resettlement  specialists,  to \nadequately implement the Project. The Project will not be affected when the management and \noperation of the TRANSCO grid is passed to a concessionaire, as TRANSCO will continue to be \nresponsible for ensuring that the Project is completed. \n \n44. \nIn  implementing  Part  A  of  the  Project,  TRANSCO  will  coordinate  closely  with  DOE, \nwhich is the executing agency for the piggy-backed TA. TRANSCO\u2019s project director will provide \nregular progress reports to DOE on the implementation of Part A. In accordance with the EPIRA \nand its implementing rules and regulations, TRANSCO will provide administrative support to the \nAGMO, chaired by DOE. \n \n\n3. \n\nImplementation Period \n\n45. \nAn  implementation  schedule  is  given  in  Appendix  8.  With  advance  procurement  action \nthe selection of the consultant for Part A will start in late 2002.  Initial market operation with a \nlimited  MMS  functionality  is  planned  before  the  end  of  2003  in  line  with  the  progress  and \nrequirements  of  the  privatization  process,  with  full  functionality  expected  in  December  2004. \nComponents  under  Part  B  will  be  completed  by  December  2008,  6  years  after  expected  loan \napproval  to  match  the  projected  demand  growth,  and  take  into  account  land  acquisition \nconstraints.  \n \n\n4. \n\nProject Operation and Maintenance \n\n46. \nO&M  of  Part  A  will  be  the  responsibility  of  the IMO  in  accordance  with  the  EPIRA  and \nthe  market  rules.  Oversight  of  market  operation  will  be  provided  by  the  Market  Surveillance \nCommittee,  constituted  under  the  market  rules,  and  by  ERC,  which  has  final  responsibility  for \nenforcing the rules and regulations governing the operations of the WESM under Section 43 (c) \nof the EPIRA.  On completion of the Project, it is anticipated that the assets constructed under \nPart B will be operated by the TRANSCO concessionaire, who will integrate the O&M of these \nassets with the rest of the transmission grid in accordance with the concession agreement. ADB \nis  reviewing  the  draft  concession  agreement  to  make  sure  that  the  assets  created  under  the \nProject will be properly maintained and operated. \n \n\n5. \n\nProcurement \n\n47. \nProcurement for all components financed by the ADB and JBIC loans will be conducted \nin accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. A list of the proposed contract packages \nis given in Appendix 9. \n \n48. \nFor Part A of the Project, a turnkey contract will be awarded for the MMS because this \ncomponent involves closely integrated hardware supply, software development, installation, and \ncommissioning. The software and complementary hardware needed for the WESM are available \nonly  from  a  limited  number  of  suppliers10 and  early  establishment  of  WESM  is  of  paramount \nimportance for the power sector restructuring and privatization, and an initial market system is \n\n                                                 \n10  For  an  interim  market  management  system  originally  proposed  for  the  World  Bank  financing  through  limited \ncompetitive  bidding,  eight  firms  from  North  America,  Europe,  Asia,  and  the  Pacific  were  invited  to  bid  for  the \ncontract but only four submitted proposals.  \n\n\f13 \n\nrequired to be operational in late 2003. Thus, international shopping with a ceiling of $22 million \nor other procurement mode acceptable to ADB will be allowed.  \n \n49. \nDraft bid documents for the MMS have been prepared but adjustments will be required \nto provide for phased development and early delivery of hardware and software. To facilitate the \nprocurement process, a panel of experts will be included in the piggy-backed TA. The experts \nwill  revise  the  bid  documents  to  ensure  that  they  (i)  reflect  current  WESM  requirements,  (ii) \nprovide  for  a  phased  implementation  consistent  with  the  Government\u2019s  industry  restructuring \nand  privatization  program,  and  (iii)  incorporate  a  transparent  bid  evaluation  process  that  is \nconsistent  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Procurement.    The  panel  of  experts  will  also  assist  DOE \nand TRANSCO with bid evaluation. \n \nFor Part B, the separate turnkey contract under international competitive bidding will be \n50. \nused for upgrading the Luzon transmission, because this component involves closely integrated \nmanufacturing and installation processes for the high voltage transmission lines and associated \nsubstations.  The  international  competitive  bidding  procedures  will  be  used  also  for  the  supply \nand  delivery  of  materials  for  expansion  of  the  Mindanao  substations.  Erection  and  installation \nwill be undertaken and funded by TRANSCO on a local competitive bidding basis in accordance \nwith  standard  procedures  of  TRANSCO,  provided  that  these  procedures  will  fulfill  its  general \nobligation  to  cause  the  project  to  be  carried  out  with  due  diligence  and  efficiency,  and  in \nconformity with sound engineering or other appropriate practices. \n \n51. \nTRANSCO and the Government understand that ADB's anticorruption policy will apply to \nthe  Project,  and  ADB\u2019s  standard  bidding  documents  will  have  to  be  used.  TRANSCO  is  also \naware  of  the  section  on  fraud  and  corruption  that  was  added  to  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for \nProcurement, particularly the need for bidders, suppliers, or contractors to observe the highest \nstandard  of  ethics  in  the  procurement  and  execution  of  ADB-financed  contracts,  and  the \napplication of sanctions if fraud and corruption are discovered. \n \nThe  last  ADB  loan 11  to  NPC  experienced  significant  front-end  delays  because  of \n52. \nprotracted  bid  evaluation  and  contract  award  processes.  TRANSCO  has  agreed  to  critically \nreview  its  performance  in  this  area,  and  take  whatever  action  is  necessary  to  ensure  that  bid \nevaluations  and  contract  awards  for  the  Project  are  completed  in  accordance  with  the \nimplementation schedule agreed with ADB. \n \n\n6. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n53. \nAbout  48  person-months  of  international  and 24  person-months  of  domestic  consulting \nservices will be required to supervise the implementation of Part A. Outline terms of reference \nand cost estimates for these tasks are given in Appendix 10. A consulting firm will be selected \nby  TRANSCO  using  quality-and-cost-based  selection,  based  on  an  evaluation  of  full  technical \nproposals  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other \narrangements satisfactory to ADB for engagement of domestic consultants.  \n \nEngineering  design  and  construction  supervision  for  Part  B  will  be  carried  out  by \n54. \nTRANSCO,  which has adequate experience and resources transferred from  NPC in this area. \nimplementation  of  externally  supported  projects,  TRANSCO  staff  have  been \nThrough \n\n                                                 \n11 ADB.  1997.  Loan  no.  1590-PHI:  Power  Transmission  Reinforcement  Project,  for  $191.4  million,  approved  on  16 \n\nDecember 1997. \n\n\f14 \n\nresponsible  for  environmental  management  and  monitoring  programs  and  have  acquired \nadequate capacity and human resources for the Project. \n \n\n7. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n55. \nDisbursements  for  all  ADB-financed  components  will  be  withdrawn  from  the  loan \naccount  in  accordance  with  the  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook.  TRANSCO  has  been \nadvised that, when commitment letter procedures are used, the minimum withdrawal amount is \nthe  contract \nthe  contractors \ntherefore,  TRANSCO  will  request \n$50,000  and, \nnegotiations to avoid small shipments under the commitment procedure. \n \n\nthrough \n\n8. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n56. \nBoth  the  borrower  and  TRANSCO  have  well  staffed  and  competent  units  to  carry  out \ntheir  financial  planning  and  budgeting  functions.  The  financial  planning  units  have  developed \ncomputerized  models  for  simulating  performance  under  a  number  of  scenarios.  The  budget \nunits  prepare  and  update  the  annual  budget  and  measure  performance  against  budget \nestimates. The external audits of both NPC and TRANSCO are conducted by the Government\u2019s \nCommission  on  Audit,  and  covers  their  financial  statements  and  operations.  The  external  and \ninternal audit functions are satisfactory. \n \n57. \nBoth the borrower and TRANSCO will submit their audited financial statements to ADB \nwithin  6  months  of  the  end  of  each  financial  year.  NPC  and  TRANSCO  confirmed  their \nunderstanding  of  ADB's  new  policy  on  submission  of  audited  accounts,  which  specifies \nmeasures  in  the  case  of  a  failure  to  submit  audited  accounts  and  financial  statements  within \napplicable due dates agreed with ADB. \n \n58. \nTRANSCO  will  provide  ADB  with  quarterly  progress  reports  concerning  the  Project's \nfinancial  aspects,  resettlement  and  environmental  issues,  procurement,  manufacturing  and \nconstruction activities, and all civil works. To facilitate postevaluation of the Project, TRANSCO \nwill provide ADB within 3 months of physical completion of the Project, a completion report that \nwill comprehensively cover details of project implementation, benefits and costs, and any other \ninformation that may be requested by ADB concerning the Project. \n \n\n9. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\nTRANSCO  will  compile  and  analyze  data  to  facilitate  project  performance  monitoring \n59. \nand evaluation. It will forward this information to ADB in accordance with the agreed schedule of \nperformance measurement indicators to assess the macroeconomic impact and achievement of \nsector development goals of the Project. \n \n60. \nAnnual ADB review missions will monitor the progress of the Project. The focus of these \nreviews will be to determine a need for any deviation from the project design or implementation; \ncost  overruns;  loan  reallocations;  and  any  other  factors,  including  assumptions  and  risks  that \nmight  constrain  the  satisfactory  implementation  of  the  Project  and  achievement  of  its \ndevelopment objectives. \n \n\nIV. \n\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n\n61. \nThe Government has requested ADB to provide advisory TA to ensure the transition to a \ncompetitive electricity market. The TA will (i) review the bid documents for the MMS and assist \n\n\f15 \n\nwith  bid  evaluation,  (ii)  provide  independent  advice  to  DOE  and  the  Government  prior  to  and \nduring initial operation of the WESM, (iii) develop an implementation plan for the selection of the \nIMO,  (iv)  conduct  industry  consultations,  and  (v)  prepare  tender  documents  and  assist  in  the \nselection  of  the  IMO.  The  TA  will  include  a  panel  of  experts  to  revise  the  existing  MMS  bid \ndocuments (para. 49).  The consultancy services will be required in power markets, regulation, \nand  information  technology  under  the  overall  coordination of  a  team  leader.  About  16  person-\nmonths  of  international  and  4  person-months  of  domestic  consulting  services  will  be  required. \nThe outline terms of reference are in Appendix 11. The panel of experts will be selected by ADB \nand  engaged  as  individual  consultants  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants.  For the balance of the TA, a consulting firm will be selected on the basis of a full \ntechnical proposal using quality and cost-based selection in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines \non the Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for the engagement of \ndomestic consultants.  \n \n62. \nThe total cost of the proposed TA is estimated to be $1.15 million, comprising a foreign \ncost  of  $700,000  and  local  currency  costs  of  $450,000  equivalent.  It  is  proposed  that  ADB \nfinance $800,000 on a grant basis from the ADB funded TA program and the Government will \nprovide  $350,000  counterpart  funding  in  local  currency  equivalent.  DOE  will  be  the  executing \nagency  for  the  TA  and  will  work  in  close  collaboration  with  TRANSCO  and  other  concerned \nagencies.  DOE  will  assign  a  TA  leader  and  counterpart  staff.  DOE  will  provide  the  consultant \nwith  adequate  office  accommodation  in  Manila,  support  secretarial  staff,  telephone,  and \nphotocopy  and  office  services.    The  panel  of  experts  will  undertake  its work  over  four  months \ncommencing  in  January  2003.    The  consulting  firm  will  complete  the  TA  during  a  12  month \nperiod, from January to December 2004. \n \n\nV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n\nA. \n\nFinancial and Economic Analysis \n\n1. \n\nEconomic Analysis \n\n63. \nThe  establishment  of  the  wholesale  electricity  spot  market  and  transmission  upgrading \ncomponents  are  complementary  and  both  are  necessary  to  ensure  that  a  sufficient  trading \nmarket for power is created. The two components have therefore been evaluated together in the \neconomic analysis by comparing with-versus-without project scenarios. Without the Project, the \npresent structure of the market and tariffs containing distortion will continue, and this will prevent \nthe generation and transmission systems from \u201csignaling\u201d the true economic price of electricity. \nWith  the  Project,  a  competitive  electricity  market  and  adequate  transmission  networks  will  be \nestablished.  A  competitive  generation  tariff  that  is  \u201ceconomic\u201d  and  significantly  determined  by \nthe interaction of market supply and demand will be introduced, and the predicted lower price of \nelectricity will generate more power consumption by end users. \n \n64. \nThe  economic  internal  rate  of  return  (EIRR)  of  the  Project  has  been  calculated  for  a \nperiod  of  20  years,  including  construction  and  operation  periods,  and  is  estimated  at  24.1% \n(Appendix 12). The EIRR calculation has been subjected to sensitivity analysis to test the effect \nof possible unfavorable changes in key variables. The sensitivity analysis indicates that it would \nrequire  an  increase  in  costs  of  73.4%  or  a  decrease  in  benefits  of  42.3%  to  reach  the  cutoff \nEIRR of 12%. \n \n\n\f16 \n\n2. \n\nFinancial Analysis \n\n65. \nA  financial  analysis  was  undertaken  using  2002  constant  prices  (Appendix  13).  The \nfinancial analysis for Part A was based on the assumption that the WESM will be operated by \nthe IMO, which will be an autonomous and independent entity. On the other hand, the financial \nbenefits for Part B were measured as the result of multiplying the incremental electricity sales \nrealized through upgrading the transmission lines and expanding of the substation capacities by \n2002  unbundled  transmission  tariffs.  The  integrated  financial  internal  rate  of  return  (FIRR)  for \nthe Project was also computed, simply by summing the costs and the benefits for Parts A and B. \nThe results of the analysis are summarized below.  \n \n66. \nPart A: MMS for WESM.  The income source for the WESM will be the market operation \nfees,  which  will  be  approved  by  ERC  and  collected  from  the  market  participants.  The  market \noperation fees have been estimated by TRANSCO to be P0.0132/kWh in 2005 and the traded \nelectricity  volumes  are  estimated  to  increase  gradually  from  43,468  gigawatt-hour  (GWh)  in \n2005  to  66,210  GWh  in  2010.12 It  is  assumed  that  about  76%  of  the  nationwide  electricity \nvolumes  will  be  traded  through  the  WESM  because  WESM  will  initially  be  available  for  Luzon \nIsland.  Based  on  these  assumptions,  the  estimated  FIRR  for  the  WESM  (part  A)  is  10.9%, \ncompared with a weighted average cost of capital (WACC) of 5.3%.  \n \nPart  B:  Transmission  Reinforcement.  Upgrading the Luzon transmission system will \n67. \nenable  electricity  from  the  power  plants  in  Luzon  to  be  transmitted  to  the  main  load  centers, \nincluding Metro Manila, and expanding the Mindanao substations will reinforce the substations \nto  meet  increased  system  demand.  For  Part  B,  the  FIRR  was  computed  based  on  a  2002 \ntransmission  tariff  of  P0.3220/kWh  for  Luzon  with  projected  incremental  electricity  transmitted \nthrough  the  upgraded  transmission  lines,  and  a  subtransmission  tariff  of  P0.1476/kWh  for \nMindanao, with projected incremental electricity transformed through the expanded substations. \nThe  main  project  costs  for  Part  B  are  equipment,  civil  works,  resettlement,  and  incremental \nO&M costs. Based on the assumptions, the FIRR for part B is estimated to be 16.9%, compared \nwith a WACC of 5.3%.  \n \n68. \nThe Project (Parts A and B).  The FIRR of the Project was computed by summing up \nthe cash flows for costs and revenues of parts A and B. Based on the above assumptions, the \nFIRR for the Project is estimated to be 14.9%, compared with a WACC of 5.3%. The financial \nnet present value, discounted at WACC, is about P 3.9 billion. \n \nB. \n\nPoverty Reduction \n\n69. \nElectricity is an input to most economic processes, and thus is an important ingredient of \nthe economic development that is essential for poverty reduction. The Project will help provide a \nreliable  electricity  supply  to  satisfy  the  forecast  electricity  demand,  including  the  demand \ncreated by accelerated rural electrification initiatives. Although the impact on poverty reduction \nof the Project has not been quantified, the lower power tariff and application of a lifeline rate13 \nwill  benefit  poor  consumers.  Upgrading  the  Luzon  transmission  system  and  expanding  the \nMindanao  substations  will  help  meet  the  additional  power  demand  in  their  service  areas  and \nfacilitate  rural  electrification,  which  will  benefit  the  poor  directly  and  indirectly.  With  access  to \nelectricity,  the  rural  poor  will  enjoy  better  education,  entertainment,  communication,  health, \n                                                 \n12 The  traded  electricity  volume  includes  the  electricity  actually  bought  and  sold  through  the  spot  market,  and  the \n\ntransactions under bilateral contracts dispatched through WESM (para. 78). \n\n13  The  EPIRA  provides  the  introduction  of  a  socialized  pricing  mechanism  called  a  lifeline  rate  for  the  marginalized \n\nend users to be set by ERC. \n\n\f17 \n\ncomfort, convenience, and productivity. A summary poverty reduction and social strategy of the \nProject is in Appendix 14. \n \n70. \nA distribution analysis of Project\u2019s net benefits was undertaken, based on the results of \nthe  Project  economic  and  financial  analyses.  The  Project  effects  were  distributed  among  the \nstakeholders  that  gain  or  lose  including  TRANSCO,  consumers  of  the  project  electricity,  the \nGovernment,  and  labor  involved  in  the  Project.  The  analysis  indicates  that  as  a  result  of  the \nProject,  while  there  is  an  outflow  from  the  Government  investing  in  the  Project,  TRANSCO, \nconsumers and labor all gain economic benefits from the Project. The analysis concludes that a \nsubstantial portion of the project benefits will go directly to the consumers including low-income \nhouseholds and the Project will achieve its primary objective of pro-poor economic growth. \n \nThe  Project  aims  to  help  eliminate  cross-subsidies  and  move  prices  toward  cost-\n71. \nreflective  rates  by  introducing  competition  into  the  subsector.  As  in  any  removal  of  subsidies, \nthere is scope for potential welfare losses, and poor households are generally more vulnerable \nunder such circumstances than the non-poor. Mitigating mechanisms are designed to leverage \nfuture  gains  and  reduce  the  near-term  burdens  of  adjustment.  One  of  the  measures  is  ERC\u2019s \nsetting  of  lifeline  rates  for  marginalized  end  users.  The  lifeline  pricing  scheme,  as  an  income \nredistribution measure, is to be reconciled with the system of minimum billing to cover the fixed \ncosts  of  providing  electricity  services.  The  lifeline  tariff  policy  is  also  to  be  supplemented  by \nprograms to improve and make less costly the access of poor households, especially rural poor, \nto electricity supply.  \n \nC. \n\nEnvironmental and Social Issues \n\n1. \n\nEnvironmental Aspects \n\n72. \nThe equipment procured under Part A of the Project will be installed inside TRANSCO\u2019s \ncompound  in  Diliman,  Quezon  City.  Therefore,  Part  A  will  not  have  adverse  environmental \nimpacts.  Transmission  components  under  Part  B  are  classified  environment  category  B.  The \nLuzon  transmission  upgrading  will  use  the  ROW  of  existing  transmission  lines  owned  by \nTRANSCO. As such, the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) does not \nrequire  an  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE)  and  issued  a  certificate  of  non-coverage  to \nthis  effect  on  16  June  1999.  Nevertheless,  TRANSCO  prepared  an  IEE  for  this  component  to \nmeet ADB\u2019s environmental requirements. The Mindanao substation expansion will be within the \nboundaries  of  existing  TRANSCO  substations  and  DENR  approved  a  certificate  of  non-\ncoverage for this component on 31 January 2000. A summary IEE is attached as Appendix 15. \n \n73. \nTRANSCO  has  agreed  that  the  Project  will  be  designed,  implemented,  operated,  and \nmaintained in accordance with (i) the national environmental laws, regulations, and standards, \n(ii)  all  applicable  provincial  and  local  regulations  and  standards  concerning  environmental \nprotection, land use, and safety, (iii) ADB\u2019s Environmental Guidelines for Selected Industrial and \nPower  Development  Projects,  and  (iv)  safety,  health,  and  environmental  standards  of  the \nGovernment.  During  implementation,  TRANSCO  will  submit  biannual  progress  reports  on  the \nimplementation  of  the  mitigating  measures  described  in  the  summary  IEE,  and  in  compliance \nwith  safety,  health,  and  environmental  standards  of  the  Government.  After  project  completion, \nTRANSCO  will  submit  to  ADB  relevant  documentation  to  demonstrate  that  the  Project  is \noperated  and  maintained  in  conformity  with  the  applicable  safety,  health,  and  environmental \nstandards.  \n \n \n\n\f18 \n\nSocial Aspects \n\n \n2. \n \n \n \n74. \nAlthough  the  upgraded  Luzon  transmission  lines  will  use  the  existing  ROW,  the \nupgrading  work  involves  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  action  for  new  transmission  tower \nfoundation  footing  sites  and  clearance  of  structures  built  within  the  ROW.  The  Luzon \ntransmission  upgrading  will  involve  constructing  303  towers,  causing  land  impacts  that  are \nwidespread but individually of very small magnitude. Permanent land impacts are 6.8 hectares \n(ha) of farmland and temporary losses are 413.8 ha. Of these, 213.0 ha are occupied by rice, \n110.7 ha by sugar cane, 66.0 by corn, and 24.1 by trees. In addition, 299 houses and 92 minor \nstructures  will  be  demolished.  Construction  of  the  transmission  lines  will  affect  1,535 \nlandowners.  Permanent  land  impacts  will  affect  2,391  families  (11,955  people)  of  which  187 \nfamilies  (935  people)  are  tenants.  Temporary  land  impacts  will  affect  1,334  families  (5,830 \npeople)  of  which  168  (840  people)  are  tenants.  House  loss/relocation  will  affect  321  families \n(1,605  people);  loss  of  minor  structures  will  affect  46  families  (230  people),  and  loss  of \ncrops/trees  will  affect  1,535  families  (7675  people).  About  70  small  businesses  will  also  be \naffected. \n \n75. \nTRANSCO has prepared a resettlement plan for upgrading the Luzon transmission lines \nin  order  to  facilitate  the  payment  of  relocation  and  compensation.  The  plan  took  account  of \nfeedback  received  from  the  affected  communities  and  the  results  of  socioeconomic  surveys. \nADB  conducted  field  inspections,  and  made  appropriate  recommendations  to  TRANSCO \nconcerning implementation of the plan. The resettlement plan and the process used to formulate \nit have been reviewed and comply with ADB\u2019s Policy on Involuntary Resettlement. A summary \nof the resettlement plan is included in Appendix 16.  \n \n76. \nTRANSCO  has  overall  responsibility  for  the  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  program \nincluding  planning,  implementation,  and  financial  tasks.  Preparation,  survey,  and  monitoring \ntasks  will  reside  with  the  TRANSCO\u2019s  social  engineering  and  ROW  management  department. \nProject  offices,  in  collaboration  with  local  government  units,  will  be  responsible  for  actual \nimplementation  work  in  the  field  including  consultation  with  stakeholders,  final  identification  of \naffected  families,  and  delivery  of  compensation.  TRANSCO  will  establish  a  monthly  reporting \nsystem  involving  project  offices\u2019  staff,  local  government  units  and  affected  families.  External \nmonitoring  will  be  assigned  to  an  independent  agency  tasked  with  the  verifying  internal \nmonitoring results and evaluating the resettlement program at the end of the Project. \n \nD. \n\nProject Risks \n\n77. \nSeveral  risks  are  associated  with  the  proposed  Project,  and  measures  are  included  to \nminimize  them.  The  Project's  main  risks  relate  to  the  pace  of  the  PSRP  agreed  with  ADB. \nTherefore, continued policy dialogue and close monitoring will be necessary to ensure adequate \nprogress in this regard. \n \n78. \nAlthough competitive electricity markets have been successfully implemented in several \ncountries,  the  California  electricity  crisis  has  brought  to  light  the  importance  of  carefully \ndesigning electricity markets. The design of the WESM in the Philippines has taken into account \nthese  lessons.  For  example,  with  most  of  the  energy  demand  contracted,  the  net  quantity \nbought  and  sold  on  the  spot  market  will  only  be  around  10%  initially.  The  market  for  this \n\u201cmarginal\u201d  demand  should  be  quite  competitive  since  there  will  be  more  supply  than  demand. \nThe market will, however, send out the correct economic signals for trading energy, supplying \nreserves,  building  new  generating  capacity  or  retiring  old  capacity,  locating  new  load  or \n\n\f19 \n\nwithdrawing  load,  and  reducing  transmission  congestion.  By  retaining  these  economic \nincentives the system should move toward a more efficient and economic industry, as a whole, \nwithout dramatic short-term effects. \n \nThe opening and successful implementation of the WESM will be an important feature of \n79. \nthe  power  industry  reform,  under  which  generation,  transmission,  distribution,  and  supply \nactivities  will  be  separated  into  independent  businesses.  It  is  important  that  the  Government \nmaintain  its  commitment  to  the  reforms.  ERC  will  need  to  monitor  and,  if  necessary  prevent \npossible  anticompetitive  behavior  of  distribution  utilities  on  the  one  hand  and  newly  formed \ngenerating  companies  on  the  other.  These  risks  have  been  recognized,  and  the  Government \nhas  realized  the  importance  of  market  competition  to  the  electricity  tariff  regime.  Adequate \nprovisions to mitigate the risks have been included in the EPIRA and its implementing rules and \nregulations.14 ADB has also assisted the Government to define competition policy and strategies \nin the energy sector that will help to further mitigate the risks.15 \n \n80. \nAdvanced  consultant  recruitment  is  being  undertaken  to  minimize  front-end  project \ndelays.  The  international  consultants  will  assist  TRANSCO  supervise  the  procurement  and \ninstallation  of  the  complex  information  technology  equipment  for  the  WESM.    Market \nparticipants  are  concerned  that  the  selection  of  IMO  be  transparent  and  that  the  IMO  be  truly \nindependent in operating the WESM. The piggy-backed TA is expected to mitigate the risks of \nmarket  startup  by  providing  independent  expert  advice  to  the  Government,  and  by  developing \nan implementation plan for the establishment of IMO. \n \n81. \nThe technical risks associated with the proposed transmission development component \nare considered manageable. Overhead transmission line design and construction are based on \nconventional technology, and power substation expansion will be designed and constructed with \nwell-proven technologies.  \n \n\nVI. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nA. \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\nIn  accordance  with  the  covenants  of  its  existing  loans  (footnote  9),  NPC  is  required  to \n82. \nmaintain a debt service coverage ratio of at least 1.3 times and return on rate base of at least \n8%.  PSALM  has  indicated  that,  after  transfer  of  assets  and  liabilities  from  NPC,  PSALM  will \nmaintain a debt service coverage ratio of at least 1.0. The Government further assured that, in \nthe  event  that  PSALM\u2019s  resources  are  not  adequate  to  meet  the  debt  service  requirement  of \n1.0, the Government will make up the shortfall through Government\u2019s budgetary process. These \nassurances will be included in the omnibus amendment loan agreement that is being drafted for \nthe transfer of NPC assets and liabilities to PSALM and TRANSCO (para. 35), and which will be \nsubmitted for Board consideration and approval in due course.   \n \n83. \ngiven the following assurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n\nTRANSCO,  being  the  executing  agency  and  operator  of  the  transmission  assets,  has \n\n \n\n                                                 \n14   The  provisions  of  the  EPIRA  and  its  implementing  rules  and  regulations  to  prevent  market  abuse  and  anti-\ncompetitive  behavior  include  (i)  prohibition  of  cross  ownership  in  TRANSCO  and  the  IMO  (ii)  limits  on \nconcentration of ownership, operation, or control of installed generating capacity and (iii) limits on bilateral supply \ncontracts by a distribution utility.  \n\n15   ADB. 1998.

In  the  event  TRANSCO  incurs  any  debt,  maintain  a  debt \nservice  coverage  ratio  of  at  least  1.0  until  31  December  2008  and  at  least  1.3 \nthereafter. \n\nCounterpart  funds.  Provide  and  release,  in  a  timely  manner,  sufficient  funds  to \nmeet  the  counterpart  funding  requirements  of  the  Project,  including  if  necessary, \nloans and other sources acceptable to ADB. \n\nProject  implementation.  Ensure  that  there  will  be  at  all  times  a  project  director, \nassisted  by  a  sufficient  number  of  suitably  qualified  and  experienced  staff,  to \neffectively implement the Project. \n\nAsset transfer. Seek ADB\u2019s consent prior to transferring the assets of the WESM to \nan IMO.   \n\nLand  acquisition  and  resettlement.  Take  appropriate  action  to  acquire  prior  to \nconstruction, all land and ROWs required for upgrading the Luzon transmission lines \nand implement the approved resettlement plan in accordance with ADB\u2019s  Policy on \nInvoluntary Resettlement to ensure that affected persons will be at least as well off \nas they would have been in the absence of the Project. Should the transmission line \neasements  change  during  construction,  revise  the  resettlement  plan,  including  full \ndetails of the losses of land, crops, houses, and other structures resulting from such \nchanges, submit the revised resettlement plan to ADB for approval, and increase the \nresettlement budget as necessary to meet any additional cost. \n\n \nB. \n\nConditions for Loan Effectiveness \n\n \n\n84. \nBefore the ADB loan becomes effective, the JBIC loan will have been approved and all \nconditions  for  effectiveness  (other  than  the  effectiveness  of  the  ADB  loan)  will  have  been \nfulfilled or arrangements satisfactory to ADB for the fulfillment thereof will have been made. \n \n\nVII. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n85. \nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  loan  would  comply  with  the  Articles  of  Agreement  of \nADB  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  of  $40,000,000  to  the  National  Power \nCorporation, to be guaranteed by the Republic of the Philippines, for the Electricity Market and \nTransmission  Development  project  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources  with  interest  to  be \ndetermined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending  facility;  a  term  of  20  years, \nincluding a grace period of 6 years; and such other terms and conditions as are substantially in \naccordance with those set forth in the draft Loan, Guarantee and Project Agreements presented \nto the Board. \n\n \nTADAO CHINO \nPresident \n \n\n22 November 2002 \n\n\fPROJECT FRAMEWORK \n\n \nDesign

However,  in  order  to  encourage  participation  in  the  WESM,  the \nElectric  Power  Industry  Reform  Act  (EPIRA)  provides  that,  for  the  first  5  years  from \nestablishment  of  the  market,  no  distribution  utility  can  source  more  than  90%  of  its  total \nelectricity requirements from bilateral supply contracts. \n \n2. \nThe  price  of  electricity  sold  through  the  WESM  will  be  set  by  the  electricity  demand \nduring a particular trading period and the bids by generators to supply electricity into the market.  \nGenerators  will  be  dispatched  on  the  basis  of  their  supply  bids  and  the  most  expensive \ngenerator will set the clearing price for that trading period.  As generators will be competing for \nsupply on the basis of price, prices can be expected to fall when there is a surplus of generation \n(the  current  situation  in  the  Philippines).    However,  when  there  is  a  shortage  of  generation \nprices will rise to the point where new generators can be expected to enter the market. \n \n3. \nWholesale electricity markets have been established in a number of counties throughout \nthe  world,  including  Australia,  England  and  Wales,  New  Zealand,  Scandinavia  and  an \nincreasing  number  of  states  in  the  United  States.    In  Asia,  wholesale  markets  are  currently \nbeing established in the Republic of Korea and Singapore. \n \n4. \nThe WESM will be managed by an independent market operator (IMO). The IMO will be \nrequired  to  work  closely  with  the  system  operator,  (National  Transmission  Corporation \n[TRANSCO] or its concessionaire), which will dispatch generation and ensure the integrity of the \nnational electricity supply system. More specifically, the IMO will (i) process offers and bids for \nsupplying  and  purchasing  electricity,  (ii)  advise  the  system  operator  of  the  generator  dispatch \nschedule that will minimize the overall cost to electricity wholesalers, (iii) process metered data \ncollected  from  the  trading  nodes,  (iv)  calculate  final  wholesale  market  prices;  and  (v)  facilitate \nthe financial settlement for electricity bought and sold through the market. \n \n5. \nThe market management system (MMS) to be installed under part A of the Project will \nenable the IMO to perform these functions.  It will include interfaces with the system operator, \ngenerators,  and  suppliers  to  provide  the  technical  and  financial  information  needed  for  the \nmarket  to  operate  successfully.    When  fully  implemented,  information  transfers  are  to  be \nelectronic and automatic. \n \n6. \nUnder  a  World-Bank-financed  project,  TRANSCO  is  installing  the  following  systems  to \nsupport  the  operation  of  the  WESM:  (i)  a  national  control  center  incorporating  an  energy \nmanagement system that will facilitate the centralized and timely dispatch of generation by the \nsystem operator, (ii) upgraded metering that will allow electricity generated or consumed at each \nmarket  node  to  be  accurately  measured  for  each  trading  period,  and  (iii)  a  communications \nnetwork  that  will  allow  the  secure  and  reliable  transmission  of  generator  dispatch  instructions \nand  metering  data  to  and  from  the  National  Control  Center.  This  project  is  scheduled  for \ncompletion by the end of 2003, on time for the WESM to be fully functional. \n \n7. \nThe  World-Bank-financed  systems  are  necessary  for  the  MMS  to  be  fully  functional.  \nSince  they  will  not  be  available  for  market  opening,  implementation  of  the  MMS  must  be \nphased.  Initially,  the  system  will  have  limited  functionality  and  many  information  transfers  will \nhave  to  be  done  manually.    As  the  World-Bank-financed  systems  are  completed,  they  will  be \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 4 \n\n29 \n\nelectronically  interfaced  to  the  MMS.    This  will  permit  greater  system  functionality  and  the \nincreased automation of market operation. \n \n8. \nGiven  the  complexity  of  the  WESM  design,  a  phased  implementation  has  other \nadvantages.    It  will  allow  subsystems  to  be  tested  and  implemented  individually.    This  will \nreduce the impact of implementation problems that may arise, and give market participants time \nto implement the systems they require to participate in the new arrangements. \n \nAs  the  current  owner  of  most  of  the  generation  that  will  initially  participate  in  WESM, \n9. \nNational Power Corporation (NPC) is negotiating transitional supply contracts with distributors.  \nThese contracts, which must be approved by the Energy Regulatory Commission (ERC) before \nthey become effective, will limit the exposure of generators and distributors to large fluctuations \nin  the  wholesale  electricity  price  during  initial  market  operation.  When  the  transitional  supply \ncontracts expire, generators and suppliers will be able to bilaterally negotiate supply contracts, \nshould they wish to reduce exposure to market price volatility.  Over the longer term, the spot \nmarket  prices  in  the  WESM  will  be  reflected  in  bilateral  contract  prices  and  all  wholesale \nelectricity will move to an economically efficient price level. \n \n86. \nThe  WESM  will  be  applied  initially  to  Luzon  Grid  and,  when  fully  implemented,  will  be \nextended to Visayas and Mindanao.  The MMS will be designed to address multi-grids or multi-\nareas, and sized to accommodate data for the whole Philippines. Hence, the Mindanao grid can \nbe covered by the WESM whether it is connected or not to the Luzon and Visayas grid. While \nMindanao remains isolated, competition for electricity supply in Mindanao will be limited to the \ntrading participants in Mindanao. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\f30 \n\nAppendix 5 \n\n \n \nCOST ESTIMATES OF THE PROJECT  \n ($ million) \n\nForeign \nExchange \n\nLocal \nCurrency \n\n \n\nSubtotal (A) \n\n1.

It is \nthe entity responsible for liquidating the National Power Corporation\u2019s (NPC) liabilities by using \nthe sales proceeds, universal charges, and other cash inflows (e.g., net profits of the National \nTransmission Corporation (TRANSCO) and of the Agus and Pulangui hydropower stations). In \nline with this responsibility, PSALM will assume responsibility for all NPC's loan payments and \nother debt repayment obligations, including this loan. PSALM will cease to exist in 25 years and \nat  that  time  all  its  outstanding  liabilities  will  revert  to  and  be  assumed  by  the  Government  in \naccordance  with  the  EPIRA.  PSALM's  cash  flow  projections  up  to  2022  are  shown  in  Table \nA7.1.  \n \n2. \nNPC's historical financial statements are also included in Tables A7.2, A7.3, and A7.4. \nWhile  the  figures  used  were  provided  by  PSALM  and  NPC,  the  valuation  of  the  assets  and \nliabilities of PSALM (other than debt) is critically dependent on a number of key value drivers. In \nparticular (i) the value of NPC's generation assets depends on the effective price of natural gas \nand the regulated price in transition supply contracts, and (ii) the net present value (NPV) of the \nindependent  power  producer  (IPP)  liabilities  is  fundamentally  dependent  on  (and  varies  with) \nlong-term  predictions  of  the  competitive  market  price  and  demand  growth.  However  it  is \nconsidered  that  NPC  is  currently  not  financially  viable  because  its  total  liabilities  account  for \nabout 90% of its total assets, and its debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) has been below 1.0 \nsince 1997. Therefore, the privatization of NPC and introduction of a wholesale electricity spot \nmarket  is  considered  necessary  to  the  development  of  a  sustainable  electricity  supply  in  the \nPhilippines.  \n \n3. \nNPC\u2019s  privatization  plan  has  been  prepared  with  the  assistance  of  Credit  Suisse  First \nBoston  and  N  M  Rothschild  &  Sons  (Rothschild).  Both  companies  (the  Advisor)  are \ninternationally  reputable  and  experienced  in  managing  divestitures  of  this  nature.  Most  of  the \nfigures and estimations provided by PSALM have been estimated and reviewed by the Advisor. \nWhile  the  valuation  of  the  assets  and  liabilities  of  PSALM  (other  than  debt)  is  critically \ndependent  on  a  number  of  key  value  drivers,  PSALM  provided  the  Asian  Development  Bank \n(ADB) with its best estimate of (i) privatization proceeds, (ii) the market value of electricity in the \ncompetitive  wholesale  market,  (iii)  operational  revenues  of  Agus  and  Pulangui  hydropower \nstations; and (iv) other relevant information. \n \n4. \nAs noted above, PSALM will take over all obligations for NPC's loan payments and other \ndebt repayments, including those of TRANSCO, NPC\u2019s small power utilities group (SPUG) and \nthe National Electrification Administration (NEA). While TRANSCO and NPC (SPUG) are to be \nseparated  from  NPC  without  debts  and  incorporated  as  separate  legal  entities,  PSALM  will \nreceive  the  net  profits  from  the  operations  of  TRANSCO,  which  is  a  fully  owned  subsidiary  of \nPSALM,  as  well  as  the  net  proceeds  from  the  privatization  of  TRANSCO.  As  the  remittances \nfrom  TRANSCO  constitute  a  part  of  the  cash  inflows  for  PSALM,  the  financial  projections  of \nTRANSCO are also developed in this Appendix.  \n\n\fAppendix 7 \n\n33

The \nGovernment  successfully  raised  $1.0  billion  in  early  2002  through  the  issue  of  a  7-year \nsovereign  bond  priced  at  8.5%  or  344  basis  points  above  the  benchmark  United  States  (US) \ntreasury bill rate, of which $750 million will be used for the NPC's liabilities. An amount of $750 \nmillion  is  expected  to  be  funded  through  a  proposed  PSALM  bond  issue  with  the  guarantee \nsupport of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to lower the coupon rate. The remaining shortfall \nof  $350  million  is  expected  to  be  raised  through  a  separate  bond  issue  with  a  Government \nguarantee  and/or  a  loan  from  the  Government.  For  the  proposed  PSALM  bond  issue  of  $750 \nmillion,  it  is  assumed  that  $250  million  will  be  funded  in  US  dollar  (USD),  and  $500  million \nequivalent be funded in Japanese Yen (JPY). The coupon rates are conservatively estimated at \n10%  for  USD  and  4%  for  JPY  in  spite  of  the  ADB  guarantee  because  of  the  long  tenor  and \nvolatile  market  conditions,  so  that  the  weighted  average  coupon  rate  for  this  $750  million  is \nestimated  to  be  6%.  For  $1.85  billion  in  total,  the  weighted  average  rate  is  estimated  to  be \n7.49%, which is the assumed interest rate in the projection. It is also assumed in the projection \n\n\f38 \n\nAppendix 7 \n\nCash Inflows \n\nthat all new borrowings, including this loan, will be treated equally, all interest on bonds will be \ntemporally capitalized, and all surplus cash will be applied to the repayment or buy-back of the \nnew borrowings.  \n  \n \nC. \n \n6. \nPSALM\u2019s  major  revenue  sources  include  (i)  universal  charges  to  cover  stranded  debt \nand  stranded  contract  costs,  (ii)  net  profits  from  TRANSCO  and  from  the  Agus  and  Pulangui \nhydropower stations, (iii) privatization proceeds, and (iv) debt assumption by the Government of \nup to P200 billion as provided in the EPIRA. If NPC's generation assets are sold to the investors \nat the currently estimated prices in a timely manner and the other revenues are also realized as \nexpected, PSALM will have sufficient resources to service the debt payments. However, there is \na timing mismatch between the receipt of expected revenues and cash outflows, particularly in \nthe  initial  years.  The  cash  flow  deficit  in  the  initial  years,  especially  in  2002,  is  greater  than \nearlier  estimated.  To  examine  the  certainty  of  revenue  sources,  each  of  them  is  discussed \nhereunder. \n \n\n(i). \nUniversal  charges  are  assumed  to  be  P0.40  per  kilowatt-hour  (kWh),  and  \ncharged to all end-users. The amount collected through the charge is estimated based \non the electricity demand forecast. \n \n(ii).   Revenues of TRANSCO are estimated based on the assumption that only 15% \nof the TRANSCO profits will be remitted to PSALM. This is assumed to be the proportion \ngenerated from subtransmission activities. Profits from the operation and maintenance of \nthe transmission facilities are assumed to be retained by the concessionaire.   \n \n(iii)  While the Agus and Pulangui hydropower stations are operated by NPC(SPUG), \nthe total net revenues will be transmitted to PSALM in accordance with the EPIRA.  \n \n(iv). \nThe privatization proceeds provided by PSALM\u2019s financial advisor are used in the \nanalysis.  These  proceeds  are  assumed  to  be  paid  (i)  partly  as  up-front  cash \nconsideration;  and  (ii)  as  deferred  proceeds,  which  consist  of  principal  and  interest \n(interest rate is assumed to be 10%), as illustrated in Table A7.5. The total principal is \nestimated  at  around  $5.4  billion,  and  the  total  interest  for  the  deferred  payments  is \ncomputed to be around $1.6 billion.  \n \n\nTable A7.5: Privatization Proceeds \n($ million) \n \nYear\n2007\n\n2006\n\n \n\n \n\n2008\n\n500  1,574 \n \n \n\n2003  2004  2005\n326\n205\n208\n\nItem \n \nUp-front \nDeferred \nInterest \nSource: Power Sector Assets and Liabilities Management Corporation. \n \n(v). \nIt  is  assumed  that  the  Government  will  inject  sufficient  funds  to  ensure  that \nPSALM  maintains  a  DSCR  of  1.0.  The  Government  is  required  by  the  EPIRA  (Section \n32) and its Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRRs) (Rule 17) to assume up to P200 \n\n \n2010  2011\n \n205 \n136 \n\n205\n194\n\n205\n179\n\n205\n165\n\n205\n151\n\n205\n122\n\n205\n108\n\n2012\n\n2009\n\n \n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 7 \n\n39 \n\nbillion (about $4 billion) of NPC debt For the calculation of DSCR, subsidies and loans \nfrom or with the support of the Government are included in the revenues of PSALM. \n\nCash Outflows \n\n \nD. \n \n7. \nThe  debt  obligations  and  IPP  liabilities  of  PSALM  will  in  aggregate  generate  cash \noutflows, which will need to be funded. The total book value of PSALM's liabilities as of 2002 is \nestimated at about $20 billion, including loans and Independent Power Producer (IPP) liabilities. \nIn addition to these, NEA's debts of $0.4 billion equivalent are also assumed by PSALM. \n \n\n(i). \nNPC's  loan  debts  of  $9.4  billion,  consist  of  (i)  the  principal  amount  about  $6.1 \nbillion,  and  (ii)  aggregate  interest  of  around  $3.3  billion.  In  order  to  calculate  the  peso \nequivalents  of  yearly  debt  services,  the  foreign  exchange  rate  P51.7  per  $  for  2002  is \ndevaluated gradually to P63.0 per $ as of 2012, and stabilized at the level.  \n \n(ii). \nIPP  obligations  now  total  some  5.1  gigawatts  (GW)  of  contracted  capacity, \nrepresenting  more  than  40%  of  the  generation  capacity  on  the  system.  The  total \nobligations will rise to 7.2 GW in 2006 and remain above 5.0 GW until 2021 before tailing \noff. A net liability arises if the selling price of electricity in a competitive market is lower \nthan  the  amounts  due  under  the  IPP  contracts,  whether  because  of  the  IPP  contract \nprice per kilowatt hour (kWh) or because of the failure to reach minimum off-take levels \nof dispatch, which, in turn, might be linked to rigid fuel supply arrangements as well as \nthe fixed payments due to the plant. With the commissioning of significant new capacity \nin  2000-2002,  many  of  the  IPPs  are  not  achieving  or  will  not  achieve  their  minimum \neconomic  off-take  levels  or  the  levels  assumed  when  the  contracts  were  signed.  As  a \nconservative  measure,  the  surplus  is  assumed  to  persist  until  2007  under  a  low \neconomic growth scenario. Consequently, NPC's IPP obligations represent a net liability. \nThe amounts of IPP obligations are estimated by PSALM and its advisor.  \n\nSensitivity Analysis \n\n \n8. \nPSALM's  yearly  operation  and  management  costs  are  estimated  at  around  $2  million. \nHowever,  separation  payments  and  transfer  taxes  are  estimated  and  assumed  to  be  paid  by \nPSALM  in  2003  and  2004.  These  are  deducted  as  a  part  of  PSALM's  operation  costs.  In \naddition,  NPC  plans  to  invest  around  P22  billion  for  capital  expenditures,  including  around  P4 \nbillion  ($80  million)  for  WESM  and  transmission  and  substation  expansion  project  funded  by \nADB  and  the  Japan  Bank  for  International  Cooperation  (JBIC)  this  year.  The  capital \nexpenditures are also deducted as a part of PSALM\u2019s costs of 2002. \n \nE.  \n \n9. \nThe base case is shown in Table A7.6. Liabilities are estimated to be recoverable by the \ntotal estimated incomes for 2003-2022, as summarized below. It is noted however that the value \nof  IPP  liabilities  is  dependent  on  the  competitive  market  prices  and  demand  growth,  and  also \nuniversal charges, which are expected to continue until 2022. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\f40 \n\nAppendix 7 \n\n \n\nTable A7.6: Summary of PSALM\u2019s Liabilities and Revenues \n\n($ million) \n\n(P million) \n\nItem \nIPP liabilities (as of 2002) \nDept Liabilities (as of 2002) \nCurrent Liabilities \nInterests on Existing Loans (2003-2022) \nNew Borrowing \nInterest on New Borrowing \nTotal Liabilities \nSales Proceeds (Principal + Interest) \nRevenues from NPC(SPUG)a/TRANSCO \nUniversal Charges (P0.40/kWh) \nGovernment Debt Assumption \nTotal Revenues for 2003-2022 \nDifference between Liabilities and Revenues \nkWh=  kilowatt-hour,  IPP=  Independent  Power  Producer,  NPC(SPUG)=  National  Power  Corporation  (Small \nPower Utilities Group), TRANSCO= National Transmission Corporation. \na NPC(SPUG) includes revenues from Agus and Pulangui Hydropower stations. \nSource: Power Sector Assets and Liabilities Management Corporation, Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n596,661 \n170,919 \n175,788 \n147,582 \n111,916 \n227,643 \n1,530,509 \n411,690 \n368,075 \n814,916 \n200,000 \n1,794,680 \n264,171 \n\n11,541\n5,240\n3,400\n2,547\n2,165\n3,738\n28,631\n7,090\n6,052\n13,300\n3,418\n29,860\n1,229\n\n \n \n10. \nAs shown in Table A7.7 below, according to the short term sensitivity tests, an additional \ncash flow mismatch of $1,181 million and $601 million respectively will have to be refinanced in \n2003 if (i) NPC\u2019s privatization is delayed by one year or (ii) the proceeds from the privatization is \n10% lower than the expectation. About $1,474 million additional cash will be required to meet \nthe financial gap if both (i) and (ii) occur. Furthermore, $800 million in PSALM's surplus cash for \nthe projection period will be reduced if both (i) and (ii) occur. The financial analysis assumed a \ngradual depreciation of the local currency from P51.7 per US dollar in September 2002 to P63.0 \nper  US  dollar  in  2012.  Sensitivity  analysis  on  further  depreciation  of  local  currency  has  also \nbeen undertaken. The analysis shows that about $975 million will have to be funded during the \nprojected period in case of depreciation of the local currency to P69.5/$ in 2012. Therefore, the \nGovernment has been advised to take all necessary measures to avoid any undue delay in the \nprivatization process and if such delay occurs, the Government will have to meet the cash flow \ndeficit.  \n \n\nTable A7.7: Sensitivity Tests \n\nCase \n\nBase Case \n(i) 1 year delay of the privatization \n(ii) 10% decrease of the sales proceeds \n(iii) both (i) and (ii) above occur \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates.  \n\nAdditional Cash Flow \nMismatch after 2003 \n($ million) \n   317 \n1,181 \n   601 \n1,474 \n\nPay-out Year of \nNew Borrowing \n(Year) \n2020 \n2021 \n2021 \n2023 \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 7 \n\n41 \n\nII. \n\nTRANSCO \n\nGeneral  \n\nA. \n \n11. \nThe  EPIRA  requires  the  transfer  of  NPC's  transmission,  subtransmission  and  related \nfacilities  to  TRANSCO,  and  the  ownership  of  TRANSCO  to  PSALM.  As  a  result  of  these \ntransfers,  TRANSCO  will  be  a  major  subsidiary  of  PSALM.  The  net  profits  of  TRANSCO  will \nconstitute a part of the income of PSALM. As TRANSCO will act as Executing Agency for the \nProject, its financial projections for the period 2002-2010 are based on the major assumptions \ndescribed below.  \n \nIn accordance with EPIRA, TRANSCO will be formed free of any NPC debt. According to \n12. \nEPIRA,  TRANSCO  will  appoint  a  concessionaire  to  finance,  expand,  operate  and  maintain  its \ntransmission facilities. On the other hand, the sub-transmission assets will be sold to Electricity \nCooperatives  within  4-5  years.  However  the  financial  projections  of  TRANSCO  presented  in \nTables  A7.8,  A7.9  and  A7.10  assume  it  remains  an  independent  and  autonomous  entity  and \ntest the viability of its transmission and sub-transmission operations. \n \n\nTable A7.8: TRANSCO's Income \n\n(P million)\n\nItem \n\nActual \n2001 \n\n2002\n39,502  43,982\n11.3%\n\nEnergy Volumes (GWh) \nIncrease in Sales \nAverage Revenue Data \nTotal Average Revenue (P/kWh)  0.2311  0.3868\nIncrease in Average Revenue \nNet Utility Revenue \nOther Revenue \nTotal Revenue \nOperating Expenses \n\n0 \n\nDepreciation/Depletion \nPersonal Services \nOperating & Maintenance \nProvision for Doubtful Accounts \n\n2003\n48,081\n9.3%\n\n2004\n52,198\n8.6%\n\nProjection\n2005\n56,930\n\n2006\n63,199\n9.1% 11.0%\n\n2007 \n\n2008 \n\n2010\n68,433  74,057  80,126 86,715\n8.2%\n\n8.3% \n\n8.2% \n\n8.2%\n\n2009\n\n0\n\n0 \n\n0 \n\n0.0% \n\n-0.9% \n\n0.4884\n67.4% 26.3%\n23,483\n0\n23,483\n11,057\n6,771\n2,870\n1,413\n3\n12,426\n0\n12,426\n3\n71\n190\n12,310\n\n0.4819  0.4774  0.4811 0.4807\n0.8% -0.1%\n32,978  35,355  38,549 41,687\n9,129  17,012\n0\n0\n32,978  35,355  38,549 41,687\n9,129  17,012\n14,780  15,228  16,022 17,152\n7,969 \n9,520\n10,203  10,375  10,878 11,700\n5,423 \n6,002\n2,829 \n1,504 \n3,370\n2,224\n1,744 \n1,038 \n2,077\n1,291\n4 \n4 \n5\n3\n18,198  20,127  22,527 24,535\n1,160 \n7,492\n6,991 \n0\n0\n18,198  20,127  22,527 24,535\n(5,831)  7,492\n139 \n279\n6\n1,356 \n71\n71\n4,363 \n1,593\n176\n(8,699)  7,393\n17,347  19,034  21,228 23,292\n91,360  93,594 101,081 114,405 132,048 160,522 182,629  193,327  198,794 207,754\n1.27%  8.01% 12.29% 11.53% 10.48% 10.26% 9.96%  10.41%  11.33% 11.81%\n\n0.4870\n-0.2%\n27,725\n0\n27,725\n13,888\n8,695\n3,660\n1,529\n4\n13,837\n0\n13,837\n3\n71\n425\n13,486\n\n0.4821\n-1.0%\n30,468\n0\n30,468\n13,999\n9,680\n2,669\n1,646\n4\n16,469\n0\n16,469\n3\n71\n674\n15,869\n\n0.4879\n-0.1%\n25,467\n0\n25,467\n12,280\n7,605\n3,222\n1,449\n4\n13,187\n0\n13,187\n3\n71\n344\n12,917\n\n3 \n71 \n1,167 \n\n2,999 \n1,849 \n5 \n\n19\n71\n1,389\n\n3,179\n1,960\n5\n\n3 \n71 \n925 \n\n0 \n\n0 \n\n0\n\nNet Operating Revenue \nInterest Expenses \nIncome after Finance Charges \nInterest Income \nOther Income \nOther Expenses \nNet Income \nRate Base \nRate of Return \nGWh=gigawatt-hour, kWh=kilowatt-hour \nSource: National Power Corporation/National Transmission Corporation\n \n\n\f42 \n\nAppendix 7 \n\nItem \n\nAssets \nTransmission Utility \n\nTotal Utility Plant \nOther Assets & Investments \nCurrent Assets \nDeferred Charges \nContingent Assets \nTotal Assets \nEquity and Liabilities \nEquity \n\nPSALM Equity \nAppraisal Surplus \nRetained Earnings/Others \n\nTable A7.9: TRANSCO's Balance Sheets \n    (P million)\n\nActual \n2001 \n\n2002\n\n2003\n\n2004\n\n2006\n\n2007 \n\n2008 \n\n2009\n\n2010\n\nProjection\n2005\n\n71,280\n\nTransmission Utility in Service  147,149  153,521 181,338 203,544 241,877 287,752 321,361  344,138  370,075 403,444\n51,889  59,136\nAccumulated Depreciation \n96,186 112,617 129,576  147,726  167,468 189,216\n95,260  94,385 110,058 121,095 145,691 175,135 191,785  196,412  202,607 214,228\nNet Utility in Service \n19,620  34,286\nWork in Progress \n15,809\n114,880  128,671 161,649 175,057 180,483 197,739 207,176  218,259  226,094 230,037\n1,325\n1,325\n10,739\n5,368\n8,183\n3,192\n8\n8\n119,041  135,261 171,138 184,469 190,376 209,981 220,572  232,725  241,467 250,292\n\n15,391  21,847  23,487\n\n1,325 \n2,244 \n584 \n8 \n\n1,325 \n5,854 \n6,209 \n8 \n\n1,325 \n6,039 \n7,094 \n8 \n\n1,325\n5,812\n5,097\n8\n\n1,325\n6,144\n1,935\n8\n\n1,325\n4,704\n553\n8\n\n1,325\n6,254\n7,786\n8\n\n1,325\n6,622\n1,534\n8\n\n22,604\n\n34,792\n\n82,449\n\n53,962\n\n51,591\n\n2,191\n\n16,107\n\n10,660\n\n23,451\n\n0  118,187 118,187 118,187 118,187 118,187 118,187  118,187  118,187 118,187\n83,192\n\n29,823 \n88,364 \n118,187  120,378 128,847 134,294 141,638 155,609 166,066  177,524  189,263 201,379\n48,892\n48,717\n13\n14\n8\n8\n119,041  135,263 171,138 184,470 190,377 209,981 220,572  232,725  241,467 250,292\n\n54,485  55,180  52,183\n13\n8\n\n47,879  59,337  71,076\n\n50,151\n17\n8\n\n54,351\n13\n8\n\n42,263\n20\n8\n\n13 \n8 \n\n13 \n8 \n\n37,422\n\nTotal Equity \nTotal Liabilities \nDeferred Credits \nContingent Surplus \nTotal Equity and Liabilities \nPSALM=Power Sector Assets and Liabilities Management Corporation\nSource: National Power Corporation/National Transmission Corporation\n \n  \n\n819  14,853\n27 \n24\n8 \n8\n\nTable A7.10: TRANSCO's Cash Flow Statement \n\n    (P million)\n\nItem \n\nA Total Receipts \n\n1.

Electricity be transmitted by TRANSCO is estimated to be 43,982 gigawatt-\nhours (GWh) in 2002, increasing gradually to 86,715 GWh in 2010. The domestic inflation rate \nis  assumed  to  be  5.5%  while  the  international  inflation  rate  is  assumed  to  be  2.4%  over  the \nprojection period. It is assumed that TRANSCO has no foreign currency debt.  \n \n\n2. \n\nTransmission Tariff \n\n \n14. \nThe  average  revenue  per  kWh  of  transmission  businesses  in  2002  is  estimated  at \nP0.39/kWh,  which  is  approximately  the  weighted  average  between  the  transmission  tariff  of \nP0.48/kWh  and  subtransmission  tariff  of  P0.06/kWh  approved  by  the  Energy  Regulatory \nCommission  (ERC)  in  June  2002.  The  average  revenue  per  kWh  of  transmission  businesses \nover  the  projection  period  is  envisaged  to  stabilize  over  the  projection  period,  at  the  level  of \nP0.48/kWh. \n \n\n3.  \n\nTaxes and Net Incomes \n\n \n15. \nFor  TRANSCO,  a  corporate  tax  is  not  charged  (NPC  also  enjoys  such  status)  while \nwithholding  taxes  for  deposits  in  bank,  real  estate  taxes  and  other  taxes  are  imposed.  The \nconcessionaire will probably be charged corporate tax. On the other hand, TRANSCO is obliged \nto remit its net profits to PSALM in accordance with EPIRA. \n \n\n4. \n\nLiabilities \n\nSensitivity Analysis \n\n \n16. \nTRANSCO is currently free from any debt of NPC, and all cash requirements, including \ncapital  expenditure  and  working  capital,  are  assumed  to  be  funded  by  the  concessionaire  as \nlong-term  liabilities  or  by  PSALM  as  cash  equity  infusions,  which  will  be  paid  back  through \nTRANSCO's future incomes. \n \nC. \n \nAs  a  basis  for  a  sensitivity  analysis,  two  assumptions:  (i)  10%  shortfall  in  estimated \n17. \nelectricity  volumes,  and  (ii)  10%  decrease in  the  real  terms  of  transmission  tariff  together  with \ndecreased  electricity  volumes  are  tested  as  shown  in  the  table  below.  According  to  the \nsensitivity tests, TRANSCO is considered financially sound even if the sales are decreased by \n10%.    However,  in  the  unlikely  event  that  transmission  tariff  and  sales  volume  are  both \ndecreased by 10%, TRANSCO\u2019s rate of return (ROR) will drop to 6.49%. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\f44 \n\nAppendix 7 \n\nCase \n\nTable A7.11: Sensitivity Tests \n\nMinimum Net Profits \nFor 2003-2010 \n(P million) \n12,310 \n9,961 \n7,848 \n\nMinimum ROR \nFor 2003-2010 \n(%) \n9.96 \n8.16 \n6.49 \n\nBase Case \n(i) 10% decrease of electricity sales \n(ii) 10% decrease of transmission tariff \nROR= Rate of Return. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\nRisks \n\n \n \n \nD. \n \n18. \nOne  of  the  main  risks  to  be  considered  for  TRANSCO  is  whether  PSALM  can \nsuccessfully  select  a  qualified  concessionaire  with  proven  international  experience  in  the \ntransmission  business.  Due  to  the  constitutional  restriction  on  foreign  investor  ownership  of \npublic utilities, foreign investors have to team up with local partners. ADB is assisting PSALM in \nthe review of the bidding documents for TRANSCO\u2019s concession to ensure that the international \ninvestor will exercise effective management control over TRANSCO\u2019s operations.  \n \n19.  While  the  transmission  tariffs  were  adequately  increased  in  June  2002,  another  risk  is \nhow the future transmission tariffs will be determined by ERC. ERC is currently studying the rate \nsetting methodologies for transmission businesses and may consider introducing a performance \nbased regulating methodology. It is noted that, in accordance with the EPIRA and its IRRs (rule \n15),  the  rates  are  to  be  set  and  adjusted  so  as  to  allow  the  recovery  of  just  and  reasonable \ncosts and a reasonable ROR to enable TRANSCO to operate viably.  \n \n\n\f \n\nIMPLEMENTATION SCHEDULE \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nIMO=independent market operator, MMS=market management system.  \nSource: Asian Development Bank  \n\ni\n\nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n8\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n4\n5\n\n\f46 \n\nAppendix 9 \n\n \nTENTATIVE CONTRACT PACKAGES \n \n \n \n \n \nContract \nType \n \n \nT \n\nProcurement \nMode \n \n \nIS or other mode \nacceptable to ADB \n\nValue \n($ million) \n \n \n22.0 \n\nPart \n\nItem \n\n \nWholesale Electricity Spot Market \nProcurement and Installation of \nhardware and Software \n\nConsulting services for \nimplementation supervision \n\n \nTransmission Development \n1.

Without the Project, the present structure of the market and tariffs containing distortion \nwould continue and prevents the generation and transmission systems from \u201csignaling\u201d the true \neconomic  price  of  electricity  to  the  end  users.  With  the  Project,  a  wholesale  electricity  spot \nmarket  (WESM)  and  adequate  transmission  networks  will  be  established.  A  competitive \ngeneration  tariff  that  is  \u201ceconomic\u201d  and  significantly  determined  by  the  interaction  of  market \nsupply and demand will be introduced, and the predicted lower price of electricity will generate \nmore power consumption by end users. \n \n2. \nThe  economic  analysis  was  conducted  using  domestic  market  prices.  The  economic \nprice of non-traded goods is equal to their domestic prices and a shadow exchange rate factor \nof 1.2 (based on the standard conversion factor of 0.83) was applied to calculate the economic \nprice  of  traded  goods.  Due  to  the  local  conditions  of  the  labor  market,  an  unskilled  labor \nconversion factor of 0.7 in domestic prices  was considered. Based on these assumptions, the \nmain  costs  and  benefits  have  been  broken  down  into  traded  goods,  non-traded  goods,  and \nskilled and unskilled labor; and specific conversion factors were calculated to value all costs and \nbenefits in economic terms. \n \nB. \n\nCosts \n\nThe  main  project  costs  include  civil  works,  equipment,  hardware  and  software,  project \n3. \nmanagement,  and  incremental  maintenance  and  operating  costs,  land  acquisition,  and \nresettlement  with  and  without  the  Project.  The  economic  costs  were  estimated  from  financial \ncosts including physical contingencies. Price escalation, interest during construction, and taxes \nwere excluded. Residual values of the capital costs were calculated at the end of the project life. \nFinancial costs were converted into economic costs using specific conversion factors for capital \ncosts and maintenance costs. \n \nC. \n\nBenefits \n\nThe main quantifiable economic benefits from the Project are benefits from incremental \n\n4. \nenergy consumption, resulting from a decrease in the price of electricity to the consumer. \n \n5. \nThe  entry  of  competition  in  the  sector  is  expected  to  bring  electricity  prices  closer  to \nmarginal costs and force overall average electricity prices lower. With the price decrease to the \nconsumer, more electricity will be consumed in the with-project as compared with the without-\nproject  scenario.  These benefits  accrue  to  incremental  energy  consumption  and  are  valued  at \nconsumer  willingness  to  pay.  The  price  elasticity  is  estimated  at  about  -0.3,  on  which  the \neconomic  benefits  from  the  incremental  electricity  consumption  are  measured.  Separate \nwillingness  to  pay  in  Luzon,  Visayas,  and  Mindanao  is  estimated  and  a  nationwide  average \nwillingness to pay is valued at around P6.09/kWh. \n \n6. \nThe Project holds other benefits that are not easy to be quantified, which mainly include \nefficiency  improvement  of  power  facilities,  potential  impact  on  cross-subsidies,  as  well  as \nbenefits from reinforcement of transmission and substation. \n \n\n\f54 \n\nAppendix 12 \n\nThe  promotion  of  wholesale  competition,  together  with  freeing  of  competition  in  the \n7. \ngeneration sector through a system of marginal cost pricing will fend off the tendency to become \ninefficient,  both  for  production  (generation  side)  and  consumption  (distribution  and  large \nindustrial customer side). With the WESM in place, the power facilities will have to compete on \nthe basis of least cost. The generation facilities will be forced to minimize their operating costs. \nOtherwise, they run the risk of not being dispatched and being priced out of the market by more \nefficiently run facilities. This will add pressure to the power facilities concerned to minimize their \noperating  costs,  and  at  the  same  time,  encourage  efficiency  programs  that  will  improve  their \nrespective heat rates thus leading to greater fuel efficiency. \n \n8. \nThe present cross-subsidies extended by the Government on electricity tariff shield the \nusers  of  the  real  value  of  the  product  and  prevent  its  economic  utilization.  The  power  sector \nreform  is  scheduled  to  eliminate  the  cross-subsidies  and  move  prices  toward  cost-reflective \nrates by introducing competition into the sector. The positive response of the production sectors \nfrom the expected lowering of industrial and commercial electricity rates due to the elimination \nof  cross-subsidies  during  the  transition  period  and  the  approach  of  electricity  prices  toward \nmarginal  cost  pricing  in  the  longer  run  is  a  significant  source  of  welfare  gains  for  households. \nThe  indirect  welfare  effects  operate  through  increases  in  household  incomes  arising  from \ngreater production activities and the consequent increase in household demand for goods and \nservices.  \n \n9. \nThe Luzon transmission upgrading subproject will enable power from  existing and new \npower plants in Luzon to be transmitted efficiently and reliably to the main load centers in and \naround  Metro  Manila.  The  Mindanao  substation  expansion  subproject  is  expected  to  increase \nthe  substation  capacity  hence  assuring  efficient  and  reliable  delivery  of  power  to  customers. \nBoth  subprojects  aim  to  promote  the  transmission  facilities,  accommodate  future  demand \nincreases,  and  ensure  sufficient,  reliable,  and  stable  supply  of  power  to  consumers  in  the \nselected areas, to meet the country\u2019s expected economic recovery and the projected increase in \nthe economic activities. \n \nD. \n\nResults of Economic Analysis \n\nThe  project  benefits  will  accrue  to  all  the  participants  in  the  grid  system,  namely \n10. \ngeneration companies, distribution utilities, suppliers, independent power producers and the IPP \nadministrators, as well as power consumers including the residential, commercial, and industrial \nsectors. In the long run, sizable welfare gains will benefit households, producers, as well as the \neconomy as a whole. The improved transmission network will also enhance access to electricity \nand improve the quality of life of local residents. \n \n11. \nThe economic internal rate of return (EIRR) of the Project is calculated for a period of 20 \nyears,  including  construction  and  operation  periods.  The  EIRR  for  the  Project  is  estimated  at \n24.1% (see Table A12.1). The EIRR calculation is subject to sensitivity analysis to test the effect \nof  possible  unfavorable  changes  in  key  variables  (see  Table  A12.2).  The  sensitivity  analysis \nindicates that it would require an increase in costs of 73.4% or a decrease in benefits of 42.3% \nto reach the cutoff EIRR of 12%, neither of which is likely to occur. \n \n \n \n \n\n\fAppendix 12 \n\n55 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nTable A12.1: Economic Internal Rate of Return \n(P million in 2002 prices)\n\n      BENEFITS\nIncremental\nEnergy Consumption\n\nCapital \nCosts \n0.00 \n686.66 \n520.69 \n802.28 \n1580.94 \n672.59 \n74.38 \n0.00 \n0.00 \n0.00 \n0.00 \n15.85 \n0.00 \n0.00 \n0.00 \n25.02 \n32.93 \n8.15 \n0.00 \n0.00 \n(790.38) \n\nCOSTS\n\nO&M\nCosts\n0.00\n0.00\n0.00\n219.49\n219.49\n219.49\n303.46\n331.07\n331.07\n331.07\n331.07\n331.07\n331.07\n331.07\n331.07\n331.07\n331.07\n331.07\n331.07\n331.07\n331.07\n\nTotal\nCosts\n0.00\n686.66\n520.69\n1021.77\n1800.43\n892.08\n377.85\n331.07\n331.07\n331.07\n331.07\n346.91\n331.07\n331.07\n331.07\n356.08\n364.00\n339.21\n331.07\n331.07\n(459.32)\n\nBenefits \n\nNET\nTotal  ECONOMIC\nBENEFITS\n0.00 \n(686.66)\n(520.69)\n(647.81)\n(970.15)\n6.96 \n595.08\n721.59\n1160.06\n1251.02\n1347.53\n1434.07\n1558.56\n1673.83\n1796.13\n1900.87\n2030.63\n2201.49\n2364.62\n2529.05\n3493.90\n\n373.96 \n830.28 \n899.04 \n972.93 \n1052.66 \n1491.13 \n1582.09 \n1678.59 \n1780.99 \n1889.63 \n2004.89 \n2127.19 \n2256.95 \n2394.63 \n2540.70 \n2695.68 \n2860.12 \n3034.58 \n\n373.96\n830.28\n899.04\n972.93\n1052.66\n1491.13\n1582.09\n1678.59\n1780.99\n1889.63\n2004.89\n2127.19\n2256.95\n2394.63\n2540.70\n2695.68\n2860.12\n3034.58\n\nYEAR \n\n2002 \n2003 \n2004 \n2005 \n2006 \n2007 \n2008 \n2009 \n2010 \n2011 \n2012 \n2013 \n2014 \n2015 \n2016 \n2017 \n2018 \n2019 \n2020 \n2021 \n2022 \n\nEIRR =  \n\n24.1% \n\nNPV (12%) = 3,040.6 \n\n \n\nEIRR=economic internal rate of return, NPV=net present value, O&M=operations and maintenance\nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates \n\nTable A12.2: Sensitivity  Analysis  \n\nScenario \n\nChange\n(percent)\n\nEIRR\n(percent)\n\nNPV (12%) Sensitivity  Switching\nIndicator  a  Value (%) b\n(P million)\n\n1.

The  domestic  price  numeraire  and  the \ndiscount rate of 12% are used for both financial and economic flows.  \n \n13. \nTable  A12.3  shows  the  distribution  of  the  project  effects  (economic  minus  financial \npresent values) among the stakeholders: NPC/Transco, consumers of the project electricity, the \nGovernment,  and  labor  involved  in  the  Project.  As  a  result  of  the  Project,  all  the  four \nstakeholders  gain.  Transco  gains  a  financial  profit  of  P617  million  from  the  investment, \nconsumers  gain  a  consumer  surplus  of  P4,820  million  from  the  Project,  and  the  Government \ngains P493 million in the investment. It is assumed that 10% of the capital and O&M costs over \nthe project life would come from the employment of labor. This labor including the poor gains a \nnet economic benefit of P21 million because the Project pays wages in excess of the economic \nopportunity cost of the labor.  \n \nThe economic pricing of electricity resulting from the WESM and reliable power supply \n14. \nfrom  transmission  system  improvement  will  benefit  the  consumers  (including  at  least  15%  of \nlow-income poor households) and labors directly  and indirectly. The analysis concludes that a \nsubstantial  portion  of  the  project  benefits  will  go  directly  to  the  consumers  including  the  low-\nincome  households  and  the  Project  will  achieve  its  primary  objective  of  pro-poor  economic \ngrowth. \n \n\n \n\n \n\nTable A12.3: Distribution Analysis for Electricity Market  \nand Transmission Development Market \n(Pmillion in present value at 12% discount rate) \n \n\n    \n\nNet \n\nNet \n\nFinancial  Economic \nReturn \n\nReturn \n\nDifference\n(Econ-Fin)\n\nNPC /\nTransco\n\nDistribution of Project Effects \n\nConsumers Government/ \n\nLabor \n\nEconomy \n\nTotal\n\nBenefits \nCosts \n  Capital Costs \n  O&M Costs \n  Corporate Tax \nNet Present Value \n\n           \n\n5,276 \n\n         \n\n10,096 \n\n         \n\n4,820\n\n          \n          \n             \n              \n\n(2,834) \n(1,522) \n(303) \n617 \n\n          \n          \n\n(2,640) \n(1,505) \n\n           \n\n5,950 \n\n             \n               \n             \n         \n\n194\n17\n303\n5,334\n\n                  \n                    \n                  \n\n175 \n15 \n303 \n\n19 \n                \n2 \n                  \n\nGains and Losses \n\n            \n\n617\n\n         \n\n4,820\n\n                  \n\n493 \n\n                \n\n21 \n\n         \n\n5,950\n\nNPC=National Power Corporation, NPV= net present value, O&M=operation and maintenance, TRANSCO=National Transmission \nCorporation \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 13 \n\n 57\n\nFINANCIAL ANALYSIS \n\nthe \n\nthe \n\nGeneral \n\ntransmission \n\nlines/substations  concerned  and \n\n \nA. \n \nThe financial internal rate of return (FIRR) analyses for Part A and Part B of the Project \n1. \nare  undertaken  using  2002  constant  prices.  The  financial  analysis  for  Part  A,  the  wholesale \nelectricity spot market (WESM), is conducted on the assumption that WESM will be operated by \nthe  independent  market  operator  (IMO),  an  autonomous  and  independent  entity,  while  the \nsystem  operations  will  be  conducted  by  the  National  Transmission  Corporation  (TRANSCO). \nTherefore, the financial benefits for Part A are evaluated as the net cash flows of the IMO. The \nfinancial benefits for Part B (Luzon transmission upgrading and Mindanao substation expansion) \nare  measured  by  the  incremental  electricity  sales  for  Part  B,  which  become  realized  due  to \nupgrading the transmission lines and expanding the substation capacities. The financial benefits \nare  estimated  by  multiplying  the  excess  electricity  volumes  traded  over  the  existing  capacities \nby  the  current  transmission  tariffs,  which  are  composed  of  a  transmission  component  for  high \nvoltage  electricity  transmitted  by  the  upgraded  transmission  lines  and  a  subtransmission \ncomponent  for  low  voltage  electricity  transformed  by  the  expanded  substations.  While  the \nintegrated nature of Part B is taken into account, the incremental electricity sales are recognized \nas  the  financial  benefits  of  Part  B  by  using  both  the  estimated  excess  loads  over  the  existing \ncapacities  of \ntransmission  and \nsubtransmission tariffs. Furthermore, the overall project FIRR analysis is also performed. While \nthe two parts are distinct in nature and WESM will be operated by the IMO, the overall FIRR is \ncomputed simply by summing up the costs and the financial benefits for parts A and B. \n \nFinancial analysis is undertaken to assess (i) the degree to which a project will generate \n2. \nrevenues  sufficient  to  cover  its  financial  costs,  and  (ii)  the  incentives  for  TRANSCO.  These \nassessments  are  conducted  on  the  basis  of  comparing  the  weighted  average  cost  of  capital \n(WACC) and the FIRRs. To undertake a sensitivity analysis (i) a decrease in electricity volumes, \n(ii) an increase in working expenses, and (iii) an increase in capital costs are tested separately \nand  jointly.  The  analysis  covers  the  period  of  loan  life  (20  years)  comprising  6  years  of \nconstruction  and  14  years  of  full  operation,  which  is  basically  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  loan \nconditions. The tables for the financial analysis are at the end of this appendix (Tables A13.1-\nA13.3). \n \n \nB.  \n \n3. \nPart  A.  The  main  project  costs  for  Part  A  are  hardware  and  software,  project \nmanagement, and the operating and maintenance (O&M) costs. The capital costs for calculating \nthe  FIRR  include  interest  during  construction  and  physical  contingencies,  while  price \ncontingencies  are  excluded.  Corporate  income  taxes  for  the  IMO  are  included  in  the  costs, \nbecause although this loan is lent to TRANSCO, which is not obliged to pay corporate income \ntaxes, the IMO will be a taxable entity. It is also assumed that the WESM will be transferred to \nthe IMO with liabilities of total project costs, and the IMO will pay them back to the TRANSCO at \nthe same conditions as this proposed loan. As the capital costs for the WESM are depreciated \nin 15 years, the same level of investment by using its internally generated cash is required after \nthe full depreciation of the WESM assets. Residual values of the capital costs as at the end of \nthe project life are calculated for the FIRR.  \n \n4. \nPart  B. The main project costs for Part B are equipment, civil works, resettlement, and \nincremental  O&M  costs.  The  capital  costs  for  calculating  the  FIRR  include  interest  during \n\nCosts \n\n\f58\n\n \n\nAppendix 13 \n\n \n\nAssumptions \n\nFinancial Benefits \n\nconstruction  and  physical  contingencies,  while  price  contingencies  are  excluded.  A  corporate \nincome tax is not included in the costs of Part B. Capital costs for Part B are depreciated in 25 \nyears, and the residual values of capital costs are calculated at the end of the project life.  \n \nC. \n \n5. \nThe  financial  benefits  for  Part  A  are  net  cash  flows,  which  are  generated  by  WESM \noperations  and  estimated  based  on  the  assumptions  in  paras.  6\u20138.  The  financial  benefits  for \nPart B are measured by the incremental electricity sales for Part B, which become realized due \nto upgrading the transmission lines and expanding of the transforming capacities of substations. \nThe  benefits  are  estimated  by  multiplying  the  incremental  excess  volumes  traded  over  the \nexisting capacities by the weighted average transmission tariffs of 2002. \n \nD. \n \n6. \nAs an important parameter and a proxy for the financial opportunity cost of capital, the \nWACC  for  the  Project  is  calculated  on  the  following  assumptions:  (i)  5.6%  interest  rate  on \nforeign  debts,  including  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  loan;  (ii)  10.0%  funding  cost  of \nTRANSCO, (iii) 5.5% local inflation rate, (iv) no corporate income tax due to the special status of \nTRANSCO,  and  (v)  around  40%  of  the  project  costs  funded  by  ADB  and  around  40%  by  the \nJapan  Bank  for  International  Cooperation  (JBIC)  respectively,  and  the  remaining  raised  by \nTRANSCO. Based on the assumptions, 5.3% is computed as the WACC for the Project. \n \n7. \nThe  WESM  will  provide  the  required  computer  software  and  hardware  to  control  and \nprocess transactions and functions. The income source for the WESM is the market operation \nfees,  which  will  be  collected  from  the  market  participants.  The  market  operation  fees  are \nestimated to be P0.0132 per kilowatt hour (kWh) in 2005 and the traded electricity volumes are \nestimated  to  increase  gradually  from  43,468  gigawatt  hour  (GWh)  in  2005  to  66,210  GWh  in \n2010. It is assumed that about 76% of the nationwide electricity volumes will be traded through \nWESM because WESM will initially be available only for the Luzon grid. For WESM, the FIRR is \ncomputed based on (i) a project life of 20 years, (ii) the above level of market operation fees, (iii) \noperations  and  maintenance  costs  of  4%  of  the  capital  costs,  and  (iv)  32%  corporate  income \ntax.  \n \n8. \nThe Luzon transmission upgrading will enable electricity from the power plants in Luzon \nto  be  transmitted  to  the  main  load  centers,  including  Metro  Manila.  The  Mindanao  component \nwill enable the reinforcement of substations to meet increased system demand. For Part B, the \nFIRR  is  computed  based  on  (i)  a  project  life  of  20  years,  (ii)  a  2002  transmission  tariff  of \nP0.3220  per  kWh  for  Luzon,  with  projected  incremental  electricity  transmitted  through  the \nupgraded  transmission  lines,  and  a  subtransmission  tariff  of  P0.1476/kWh  for  Mindanao  with \nprojected  incremental  electricity  transformed  through  the  expanded  substations,  (iii)  system \nlosses  of  4%;  and  (iv)  incremental  O&M  costs  of  4%  of  the  capital  costs  of  the  upgraded \ntransmission line and expanded substation facilities. \n \nE. \n \n9. \nThe  FIRR  for  Part  A  is  estimated  at  10.9%,  compared  with  the  WACC  of  5.3%.  The \nsensitivity analysis showed that the FIRR would decrease to (i) 8.0% if the Project experienced \nan  electricity  sales  decrease  of  10%,  (ii)  9.0%  if  its  working  expenses  increased  by  10%;  (iii) \n9.5%  if  a  10%  cost  overrun  happened;  and  (iv)  4.8%  if  all  (i),  (ii),  and  (iii)  occurred \nsimultaneously.  Therefore,  Part  A  is  considered  financially  viable  under  most  downside \n\nFIRR and Sensitivity Tests \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 13 \n\n 59\n\nscenarios. In addition, the Electric Power Industry Reform Act (EPIRA) stipulates that the costs \nof  administering  and  operating  the  WESM  will  be  recovered  by  the  IMO  through  a  market \ncharge imposed on all market members.  \n \nBased on the above assumptions, the FIRR for Part B is estimated at 16.9%, compared \n10. \nwith  the  WACC  of  5.3%.  The  sensitivity  analysis  showed  that  the  FIRR  would  decrease  to  (i) \n15.0% if the Project experienced an electricity sales decrease of 10%, (ii) 16.2% if its working \nexpenses increased by 10%; (iii) 15.1% if a10% cost overrun happened; and (iv) 12.5% if all (i), \n(ii), and (iii) occurred. Therefore, under the current assumptions, it is considered that Part B is \nfinancially  viable  as  the  FIRR  exceeds  the  WACC,  and  shows  a  reasonable  incentive  for \nTRANSCO in terms of the incremental cash flows. \n \nThe  FIRR  of  the  Project  is  computed  by  summing  up  the  cash  flows  for  costs  and \n11. \nrevenues  for  Parts  A  and  B.  Based  on  the  above  assumptions,  the  FIRR  for  the  Project  is \nestimated at 14.9%, compared with WACC of 5.3%. The financial net present value discounted \nat  the  WACC  is  about  P3.9  billion.  The  sensitivity  analysis  showed  that  the  FIRR  would \ndecrease to (i) 12.8% of the Project experienced an electricity sales decrease of 10%; (ii) 13.9% \nif its working expenses increased by 10%; (iii) 13.4% if a 10% cost overrun happened and (iv) \n10.3% if all (i), (ii), and (iii) occur. Therefore, under the current assumptions, the overall Project \nis also considered financially viable as the FIRR exceeds the WACC. \n\n\f6\n0\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n

\n\n \nA. \n \nSector identified as a national \npriority in country poverty analysis?  Yes \n\n \n\nSector identified as a national \npriority in country poverty  \npartnership agreement? \n\n  \n\nYes \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nPoverty Analysis \n\nProposed Classification: Other \n\nContribution of the sector/subsector to reduce poverty in the Philippines: \n \nMost  of  the  poor  population  lives  in  rural  areas.  A  major  component  of  the  current  energy  sector  program  in \nPhilippines  is  the  accelerated  electrification  of  rural  areas  to  attain  economic  and  social  development.  The \nelectrification  program  will  be  undertaken  mainly  through  rehabilitation  and  extension  of  distribution  lines  including \ninstallation of substations. For areas far from the grids, a program of off-grid new and renewable energy systems will \nbe fully implemented to electrify the rest of the villages and households. With access to electricity, the rural poor will \nenjoy  better  education,  entertainment,  communication,  health,  comfort,  convenience,  and  productivity.  In  particular, \nthe development of livelihood projects is critical for sustaining of such electrification projects, as the livelihood projects \nwill improve the income generation capacity of the rural households so they can pay for the electricity. \n \n \nB. \nAnalysis: \n \nElectricity is an input to most economic processes, and thus is an important ingredient of economic development that \nis essential for poverty alleviation. The proposed Project will help provide an adequate and reliable electricity supply \nto satisfy the forecast electricity demand, including the accelerated rural electrification initiatives. Although the impact \non poverty reduction cannot be quantified, the lower power tariff and application of lifeline rate  will benefit the poor \nconsumers.  Upgrading  the  Luzon  transmission  lines  and  expansion  the  Mindanao  substations  will  help  meet  the \nadditional  power  demand  in  their  service  areas  and  ensure  the  rural  electrification  that  will  benefit  the  poor  directly \nand indirectly. A pilot project being developed with the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction in support of the Project will \npromote livelihood and development projects using electricity in selected areas in the country. \n \n \nParticipation Process \nC. \nStakeholder analysis prepared  \n \nParticipation strategy: \nFor part A, the Department of Energy conducted a series of consultations with industry power industry participants in \nLuzon,  Visayas,  and  Mindanao.  For  part  B,  the  National  Transmission  corporation  (TRANSCO)  presented  the \nproposed  project  components  to  affected  communities  and  host  local  government  units  and  regional  development \ncouncils starting in April 1998.  \n \nD. \n \n \nSubject \nResettlement \n\nPotential Issues \n\nSignificant, \n\nNo \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \nOutput Prepared \nFull resettlement plan \nprepared \n\nSignificant,  \nNot \nUncertain, None \nSignificant for one \nof the project \ncomponents, i.e. \nLuzon transmission \nupgrading \n\n(i)  avoid \n\npopulation \n\n \n \nStrategy to Address Issues \nTo \nresettlement \ninvoluntary \nwherever  feasible,  (ii)  minimize  resettlement \nis \nwhere \nunavoidable,  and  (iii)  ensure  that  displaced \npeople  receive  assistance  so  that  would  be \nat  least  well-off  as  they  would  have  been  in \nthe absence of the project. \n \n \n \n \n\ndisplacement \n\nGender \nAffordability \nLabor \nIndigenous  \nPeople \nOther Risks/ \nVulnerabilities \n\nNot significant \nNot significant \nNot significant \nNone \n\nNone \n\n \n\nNo \nNo \nNo \nNo \n\nNo \n\n\f62 \n\nAppendix 15 \n\n \n \nA. \n\nIntroduction \n\nSUMMARY INITIAL ENVIRONMENTAL EXAMINATION \n\n1. \nThe Project consists of Part A\u2013procuring and installing the hardware and software for the \nwholesale  electricity  spot  market  (WESM),  and  Part  B\u2013upgrading  Luzon  transmission  and \nexpanding of Mindanao substations. As Part A has no environmental implications, this summary \ninitial environmental examination discusses only the environmental impacts of Part B. \n \n2. \nUpgrading the Luzon transmission is exempted from environmental examination, by the \nEnvironment  Management  Bureau  of  the  Department  of  Environment  and  Natural  Resources \n(DENR)  as  it  only  involves  upgrading  existing  230  kV  overhead  transmission  lines  and \nassociated  substations.  DENR\u2019s  certificate  of  non  coverage  (CNC)  was  issued  on  16  June \n1999. DENR issued the certificate for expanding the Mindanao substations on 31 January 2000 \nas  it  only  involves  installing  additional  power  circuit  breakers  and  transformers  within  existing \nsubstations. \n \nNevertheless, an environmental examination was carried out, including (i) a study of the \n3. \nproject \n(ii) \nidentification  of  the  types  and  relative  magnitudes  of  potential  environmental  impacts  with \nconcerned  DENR  regional  offices  and  stakeholders,  (iii)  establishment  of  environmental \nbaselines  through  primary  and  secondary  data  gathering,  (iv)  assessment  of  impacts,  and  (v) \nformulation  of  protection  measures  and  a  monitoring  plan.  The  Asian  Development  Bank\u2019s \n(ADB\u2019s)  social  development  and  resettlement  specialist  inspected  the  entire  easement  of  the \nLuzon  transmission  upgrading  in  April  1999  and  again  in  May  2002.  In  addition,  ADB\u2019s \nenvironment  specialist  reinspected  the  easement  in  project  areas  in  May  1999,  and  met  with \nNational  Transmission  Corporation  (TRANSCO)  staff  to  update  the  current  environmental  and \nsocial status of the project sites in April 2002. \n \nB. \n\nfacilities,  construction  activities,  and  operational  characteristics, \n\nDescription of the Environment \n\nfeatures, \n\n1. \n\nPhysical Environment \n\n4. \nLuzon  Transmission  Upgrading.  This  component  will  use  the  existing  right-of-way \n(ROW). The transmission lines will pass through the central Luzon plain, which consists mostly \nof  alluvial  deposits  from  the  Pampanga  and  Bulacan  rivers.  The  area  has  been  covered  by  a \nthin  layer  of  volcanic  ash  from  the  1991  eruption  of  Mt.  Pinatubo.  However,  the  ROW  is  not \naffected by the lahar flow. \n \nMindanao  Substation  Expansion.  The  expansion  will  be  done  within  existing \n5. \nsubstation  compounds,  which  comprise  cleared  and  graded  land  with  service  roads  and \ndrainage that can accommodate construction and operation of the expanded facilities. \n \n\n2. \n\nEcological Environment and Land Use \n\n6. \nLuzon  Transmission  Upgrading.  The  upgrading  will  reinforce  and  upgrade  the  230 \nkilovolt (kV) transmission network in Luzon to facilitate transfer of additional power coming from \nplanned  independent  power  producer  generation.    It  involves  117  kilometers  of  double  circuit \ntransmission  lines  between  San  Manuel,  Tarlac  and  Mexico,  Pampanga.  Most  of  the  affected \nareas  are  agricultural  lands  (rice,  sugar  cane,  trees,  and  other  plants).  In  the  line  from  San \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 15 \n\n63 \n\nManuel  to  Concepcion,  Pampanga,  about  30%  of  the  crops  affected  are  rice  and  60%  are \nsugarcane. However, in Conception-Mexico line, rice accounts for 80% of the crop. \n \n7. \nThe  transmission  lines  will  pass  through  rice  fields  from  Mexico,  Pampanga  to \nValenzuela, Bulacan. The area from Mexico to Valenzuela has been cultivated for a long time. \nNo forest or reserve areas are affected by the existing ROW. Freshwater fish, mosquitoes, and \nrice  borers  and  their  larvae  are  the  predominant  fauna.  In  recent  years,  consumption  of  the \nfreshwater  fish  has  declined  and  is  discouraged  due  to  the  extensive  use  of  chemical \ninsecticides to control the insect population. \n \n8. \nMindanao  Substation  Expansion.  Unused  areas  in  the  substations  are  covered  with \ngravel to control weeds and grass. Grass that penetrates the gravel cover is removed manually \nbecause the grass and weeds are potential fire hazards. The area is fenced and a buffer zone is \nmaintained around the perimeter. Fauna within the substations is composed primarily of small \ninsects and birds. \n \n\n3. \n\nSocioeconomic Environment \n\n9. \nIn 2002 socioeconomic surveys were conducted through an interview of 1,629 affected \nhouseholds.  The  affected  household  heads  have  diverse  occupations.  About  29%  are \nconstruction workers comprising masons, laborers, carpenters, and painters, and another 19% \nare  transport  workers  comprising  drivers  and  helpers.  The  sales  workers  and  agricultural \nworkers  follow  with  12%  and  11%  respectively.  Other  occupational  groups  include  service \nworkers,  self-employed  individuals,  overseas  contract  workers.  About  30%  of  the  households \nearn  P3,000  per  month  and  below.  Another  30%  earn  P3,001  to  P6,000  per  month,  and  the \nremainder  earn  above  P6,001  per  month.  Most  of  the  households  (94%)  own  the  house  they \noccupy. In terms of lots occupancy, only 13% of the households own the lots where their houses \nare built. About 47% are occupying the lots with consent of owners and the remaining 40% are \nsquatters. \n \nC. \n \n\nScreening of Potential Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n\n1. \n\nPhysical Environment \n\nto \n\nLuzon  Transmission  Upgrading.  The  impacts  on  the  physical  environment  will  be \n10. \ntemporary,  reversible,  and  mostly  related \nthe  dust,  noise,  and  vibration  during \ndecommissioning  and  dismantling  of  the  existing  transmission  towers  and  the  erection  of  new \ntowers.  The  best  known  practices  for  minimizing  and  mitigating  these  impacts  will  be \nimplemented,  including  restriction  of  working  hours  in  populated  areas  to  minimize  noise  and \nvibration, and dust mitigation by watering roads and other significant sources of dust. \n \n11.  Mindanao  Substation  Expansion.  The  impact  on  the  physical  environment  will  be \nminimal  and  mostly  related  to  the  noise  and  dust  generated  during  the  erection  of  the  new \nsubstation equipment. Mitigation measures to be implemented are as described in para. 10. \n \n\n2. \n\nEcological Environment\u2013Terrestrial Ecology \n\n12. \nLuzon  Transmission  Upgrading. Some sections of the ROW will be temporarily used \nto  haul  heavy  equipment.  The  land  will  be  compacted  from  the  load  of  the  trucks  and  heavy \nequipment.  Rice  cannot  be  cultivated  in  areas  affected  during  construction.  After  construction, \nthe  land  will  be  loosened  and  compost  spread  over  it  to  restore  fertility.  The  discarded  old \n\n\f64 \n\nAppendix 15 \n\ntransmission lines and materials will be properly treated for reuse. The old substation equipment \nwill  be  examined  for  polychlorinated  biphenyls  (poisonous  organic  chemicals),  which  were \ncommonly  used  for  electrical  and  heat  insulation  in  older  substations.  If  polychlorinated \nbiphenyls  are  found,  the  equipment  will  be  wrapped  and  sealed  for  special  storage  within  the \nsubstation until facilities are available in the Philippines to treat such wastes. \n \n13.  Mindanao  Substation  Expansion.  This  component  will  have  no  impact  on  the \nenvironment. No new access roads will be built. The sites for the additional circuit breakers and \ntransformers  have  been  kept  cleared  since  the  substations  were  installed.  The  replaced \nequipment will be examined, and if polychlorinated biphenyls are found, the equipment will be \nwrapped and sealed for special storage within the substation until facilities are available in the \nPhilippines to treat such wastes. \n \n\n3. \n\nResettlement Issues \n\nInstitutional Requirement and Environmental Monitoring Program \n\n \n14. \nAlthough upgrading of the Luzon transmission will use the existing ROW, it involves land \nacquisition  and  resettlement  action  for  transmission  tower  foundation  footing  sites  and \nclearance  of  structures  built  within  the  ROW.  On  the  basis  of  the  feedback  received  from  the \naffected communities and the results of the socioeconomic surveys, TRANSCO has prepared a \nresettlement  plan  for  Luzon  transmission  upgrading  in  order  to  facilitate  the  payment  of \nrelocation  and  compensation.  The  ADB  conducted  field  inspections,  and  made  appropriate \nrecommendations  to  TRANSCO  concerning  implementation  of  the  plan.  A  summary  of  the \nresettlement plan is included in Appendix 16. \n \nD. \n \n15. \nimplementation  of  externally  supported  projects,  TRANSCO  has  been \nresponsible  for  environmental  management  and  monitoring  programs  and  acquired  adequate \ncapacity  and  human  resources  for  them.  The  environmental  management  plan  for  the  Project \ncovers  the  two  components,  for  upgrading  Luzon  transmission  and  expanding  Mindanao \nsubstations.  The  plan  aims  to  ensure  strict  implementation  of  the  proposed  environmental \nmanagement measures and to safeguard the affected provinces against potential impacts. \n \n16. \nEnvironmental impacts were identified after evaluating the activities that will transpire in \nall  project  stages,  identifying  the  areas  to  be  affected,  and  examining  their  condition.  The \nProject\u2019s impacts were then assessed based on experience with similar projects. Management \nmeasures  adopted  for  the  Project  include  those  already  applied  and  proven  effective  in  past \nTRANSCO projects. Environmental management measures recommended are as follows: \n \n\nThrough \n\nCivil  works  guidelines  and  occupational  and  public  health  and  safety \nguidelines.  These  were  formulated  to  direct  the  contractor\u2019s  social  and \nenvironmental  responsibilities  and  will  manage  impacts  associated  with  civil \nworks. \n\nReforestation  program. TRANSCO will plant 10 trees for every tree to be cut, \nand  this  will  be  coordinated  with  village  captains  to  determine  erosion-prone \nareas in their villages. \n\nEnvironmental  monitoring  plan.  Environmental  monitoring  is  necessary  to \ncheck  whether  environmental  measures  recommended  by  TRANSCO  are \nproperly  implemented  during  the  project  construction.  It  will  also  check \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 15 \n\n65 \n\n \n\n \nE. \n\ncompliance of the contractor with the guidelines to ensure that the environmental \nmanagement  plan \nis  carried  out  effectively.  TRANSCO\u2019s  Environmental \nManagement Department, Social Engineering Department, and the project office \nwill  jointly  implement  the  recommended  environmental  management  measures \nand  ensure  that  they  are  effective  and  complied  with.  The  contractor\u2019s \nresponsibilities include compliance with the agreed contract with TRANSCO and \ncontrol of its workforce. The pollution control officer will be responsible for overall \nmonitoring  of \nthe  environmental  policies, \nenvironmental compliance certificate conditions, and DENR air and water quality \nstandards.  \n\nthe  Project\u2019s  compliance  with \n\nFindings and Recommendations \n\n \n\n17. \nOn  the  basis  of  the  initial  environmental  assessment  findings,  the  Luzon  transmission \nupgrading  and  Mindanao  substation  expansion  will  not  affect  any  environmentally  sensitive \nareas  and  will  exert  a  neutral  or  only  very  small  influence  on  the  environment.  Detailed \nenvironmental  impact  assessment  is  not  required.  Starting  with  the  identified  environmental \nimpacts,  TRANSCO  will  incorporate  mitigation  and  environmental  management  proposals  and \nrecommendations for implementation in the Project.   \n \nF. \n\nConclusion \n\n18. \nBased  on  the  assessment  of  the  environmental  and  socioeconomic  aspects  of  the \nProject  and  because  TRANSCO  has  agreed  to  meet  the  commitments  described,  all \nenvironmental,  occupational,  health,  safety,  and  socioeconomic  impacts  of  the  Project  can  be \nmanaged  to  levels  that  fully  comply  with  all  applicable  international  guidelines  and  the \nrequirements of the ADB and DENR.  \n \n \n\n\f66 \n\nAppendix 16 \n\n \n\nSUMMARY RESETTLEMENT PLAN \n\nBackground \n\n \nA. \n \n1. \nThe  Luzon  transmission  upgrading  component  consists  of  constructing  of  117.08 \nkilometers of transmission lines and will require acquiring land affected by towers and removing \nall  houses  within  the  40  meter  (m)  right-of-way  (ROW).  To  regulate  the  compensation  and \nresettlement  for  the  component  a  full  resettlement  plan  has  been  prepared  by  National \nTransmission  Corporation  (TRANSCO),  the  executing  agency  of  the  Project.  The  resettlement \nplan,  field  visits,  and consultation  with  TRANSCO  and  affected  families form  the  basis  for  this \nsummary.  \n \n2. \nAs  a  precondition  for  project  appraisal,  this  resettlement  plan  was  prepared  based  on \ndetailed measurement survey and on a compensation framework in accordance with Philippine \nregulations (RA 8674), and Asian Development Bank (ADB) policy on involuntary resettlement \nas detailed in the ADB Handbook on Resettlement: A Guide to Good Practice. The delivery of \ncompensation  and \nincluding  houses \nreconstruction will be a condition for contract awards.  \n \nB. \n\nResettlement Policy, Eligibility, and Entitlements \n\nthe  resettlement  program \n\nimplementation  of \n\nthe \n\n3. \nThe resettlement plan outlines basic policy principles. These are (i) negative impacts will \nbe  minimized  as  much  as  possible,  (ii)  resettlement/compensation  will  be  carried  out  so  as  to \nimprove  or  at  least  restore  the  affected  people\u2019s  pre-project  living  standards,  (iii)  affected \npersons  will  be  thoroughly  informed  and  consulted  on  compensation  options  and  the \nresettlement plan's design, (iv) affected assets will be compensated at replacement cost, and (v) \ncompensation  and  resettlement  subsidies  will  be  provided  in  full  prior  to  ground  leveling  and \ndemolition. \n \n4. \nThe  resettlement  plan  also  stipulates  eligibility  and  entitlement  provisions  for  project-\naffected  people  losing  land,  houses,  and  income,  and  provides  rehabilitation  subsidies. \nPermanent  land  losses  will  be  compensated  in  cash  at  market  rates.  House  losses  will  be \ncompensated in cash at replacement rates free of demolition expenses and salvaged materials. \nCrops  losses  will  be  compensated  in  cash  at  market  rates.  Affected  families  will  also  receive \nvarious  subsidies,  including:  a  disturbance  compensation  subsidy  of  P10,500  for  all  resettled \naffected  families;    resettlement  financial  assistance  of  P27,850  for  all  affected  families  losing \nhouses, and when applicable a business loss allowance covering business losses based on tax \ndeclarations  or  on  a  fixed  daily  allowance  of  P200  for  the  number  of  days  of  business \ninterruption caused by the Project. \n \nC. \n\nImpacts Assessment  \n\n5. \nThe  Luzon  transmission  upgrading  will  involve  constructing  303  towers,  causing  land \nimpacts  that  are  widespread  but  of  very  small  magnitude  (no  affected  families  will  lose  more \nland  than  one  tower  base  of  225  to  400  square  meters).  Permanent  land  impacts  are  6.8 \nhectares (ha) of farmland and temporary losses are 413.8 ha. Of these, 213.0 ha are occupied \nby rice, 110.7 ha by sugar cane, 66.0 by corn, and 24.1 by trees. In addition, 299 houses and 92 \nminor  structures  will  be  demolished  within  the  ROW  of  the  transmission  lines.  Construction  of \nthe  transmission  lines  will  affect  1,535  landowners.  Permanent  land  impacts  will  affect  2,391 \nfamilies  (11,955  people)  of  which  187  families  (935  people)  are  tenants.  Temporary  land \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 16 \n\n67 \n\nPublic Consultation and Disclosure \n\nimpacts will affect 1,334 families (5,830 people) of which 168 (840 people) are tenants. House \nloss/relocation  will  affect  321  families  (1,605  people);  loss  of  minor  structures  will  affect  46 \nfamilies (230 people), and loss of crops/trees will affect 1,535 families (7675 people). About 70 \nsmall businesses will also be affected. \n \nD. \n \n6. \nThe resettlement plan was prepared by TRANSCO through a wide consultative process \nincluding  surveys  and  public  meetings.  The  public  meetings  involved  all  concerned  local \ngovernment  units  (LGUs),  relevant  regional  development  councils,  and  representatives  of  the \naffected families. \n \nA  project  primer  has  been  distributed  in  July  2002  to  all  affected  families  and  LGUs \n7. \ninforming  them  of  the  project\u2019s  technical  aspects,  compensation  policy  and  procedures.  The \nresettlement plan will be disclosed in all affected LGUs, at project offices, and at ADB through \nthe ADB website. \n \nE. \n\n Institutional Responsibilities \n\nGrievance Procedures \n\n Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n8. \nTRANSCO  has  overall  responsibility  for  the  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  program \nincluding  planning,  implementation,  and  financial  tasks.  Preparation,  survey  and  monitoring \ntasks  will  reside  with  TRANSCO\u2019s  Social  Engineering  and  ROW  Management  Department. \nProject offices, in collaboration with LGUs, will be responsible for actual implementation work in \nthe  field,  including  consultation  with  stakeholders,  final  identification  of  affected  families  and \ndelivery of compensation. \n \nF. \n \n9.    Complaints  and  grievance  procedures  are  established  in  the  resettlement  plan. \nGrievances  will  be  first  lodged  with  local  project  offices.  In  the  absence  of  agreement,  the \ncomplaints  will  be  addressed  to  the  village-level  authorities  with  further  possibility  of  elevating \nthe  case  to  the  Land  and  Land  Rights  Department  of  TRANSCO  and,  eventually,  to  the \nappropriate civil courts. \n \nG. \n \nTRANSCO  will  establish  a  monthly  reporting  system  involving  project  staff,  LGUs,  and \n10. \naffected families. External monitoring will be assigned to an independent agency tasked with the \nverification of internal monitoring results and the evaluation of the resettlement program at the \nend of the Project. Internal monitoring reports will be sent quarterly to ADB. External monitoring \nreports  will  be  submitted  to  ADB  twice  a  year  until  the  end  of  the  resettlement  program.  The \nexternal monitoring agency will also prepare a final evaluation report to be submitted to ADB 3 \nmonths before the loan closing date. \n \nJ. \n \n11. \nResettlement  and  land  acquisition  costs  for  the  project  are  estimated  at  P195  million, \nincluding  land  and  buildings  compensation,  resettlement  assistance,  management  costs, \nmonitoring,  and  taxes.  Costs  will  be  adjusted  annually  based  on  the  previous  years'  inflation \nrate. \n \n\nFinances \n\n\f", "author_pages": ["CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 4 November 2002) \n", "Currency Unit\nP 1.00\n$1.00\n", "\u2013 \n= \n= \n", "Peso (P) \n$0.0189 \nP 53.00 \n", " \n \n", " \n \n", " \nIn the Report, a rate of $1.00 = P 51.70, the rate generally prevailing at the time of preparation \nof cost estimates and financial projections, has been used. \n \n", "ABBREVIATIONS \n", "ADB \nAGMO \nCNC \nDENR   \nDOE \nDSCR \nEIRR \nEPIRA \nERC \nFIRR \nGENCO \nICB \nIDC \nIEE \nIMO \nIPP \nIRRs \nJBIC \nLGU \nLRMC \nMERALCO \nMMS \nNPC \nO&M \nOPEC \nPEP \nPSALM \nPSRP \nRORB \nROW \nTA \nTDP \nTIRP \nTRANSCO \nUS \nWACC \nWESM \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "Asian Development Bank \nautonomous group market operator \ncertificate of non coverage \nDepartment of Environment and Natural Resources \nDepartment of Energy \ndebt service coverage ratio  \neconomic internal rate of return \nElectric Power Industry Reform Act \nEnergy Regulatory Commission \nfinancial internal rate of return \ngenerating company \ninternational competitive bidding \ninterest and commitment charges during construction \ninitial environmental assessment \nindependent market operator \nindependent power producer \nimplementing rules and regulations \nJapan Bank for International Cooperation \nlocal government unit \nlong-run marginal cost \nManila Electric Company  \nmarket management system \nNational Power Corporation \noperations and maintenance \nOrganization of Petroleum Exporting Countries \nPhilippine Energy Plan \nPower Sector Assets and Liabilities Management Corporation \npower sector restructuring program \nreturn-on-rate base  \nright-of-way \ntechnical assistance \ntransmission development plan \ntransmission interconnection and reinforcement project \nNational Transmission Corporation \nUnited States \nweighted average cost of capital  \nwholesale electricity spot market \n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n", " \n", "GWh \nha \nkm \nkWh \nkV \nkW \nMVA \nMW \n", "WEIGHTS AND MEASURES \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "gigawatt-hour \nhectare \nkilometer \nkilowatt-hour \nkilovolt \nkilowatt \nmegavolt-ampere \nMegawatt \n", "NOTES \n", " \n(i) \n(ii) \n", "The fiscal year of the Government, NPC and TRANSCO ends on 31 December. \nIn this report, \u201c$\u201d refers to US dollars. \n", "This  Report  was  prepared  by  a  team  consisting  of  Y.
