The  report  also  describes  the  proposed  administration  of  a  secured  loan  of  up  to \n$4,750,000 to be provided by the Clean Technology Fund (CTF)1 for the Southern Thailand Wind \nPower and Battery Energy Storage Project. If the Board approves the proposed loan, I, acting \nunder the authority delegated to me by the Board, approve the administration of the CTF loan. \n \n2. \nThe  proposed  loans  will  support  Lomligor  in  providing  long  term  financing  for  a  10-\nmegawatt (MW) wind power project with an integrated 1.88-megawatt-hour (MWh) pilot battery \nenergy storage system (BESS). The project will be the first private sector project in Thailand to \nintegrate  utility-scale  wind  power  generation  with  battery  energy  storage,  and  will  have  an \nimportant demonstration effect. As the deployment of intermittent generation from wind and solar \nincreases, battery energy storage becomes vital in providing higher levels of renewable energy \nto the grid and helping ensure the stability and reliability of the overall power system. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nProject Identification and Description \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nProject identification. Thailand\u2019s natural gas resources have long been a reliable source \nof low-cost energy, but growing demand, dwindling domestic reserves, and the commitment to \nreduce greenhouse gas emissions mean the country must find new fuels and technologies to help \nmeet its future power needs. Power consumption has risen by an annual average of 3.5% from \n2009  to  2018,  and  demand  is  expected  to  double  from  2015  to  2036.  To  meet  this  demand, \nThailand adopted the Power Development Plan, 2018\u20132037, which targets to install 29,358 MW \nof  renewable  energy  capacity  by  2037,  representing  about  33%  of  total  installed  electricity \ngeneration capacity.2 As of December 2018, the country had installed 8,127 MW of renewable \nenergy capacity, or about 27.7% of the overall target. As regards wind power generation, only \n1,018 MW  or  34.1%  of  the  total  target  of  2,989  MW  had  been  met.  Major  private  sector \ninvestments in renewable energy, especially wind, are required to meet the government\u2019s clean \nenergy targets. As Thailand increases the share of intermittent renewable energy sources (solar \nand  wind),  battery  energy  storage  will  become  an  important  technology  to  underpin  the  grid, \nproviding such services as frequency support, voltage support, ramping support, peak shaving, \nload shifting, and transmission deferral.3 \n \n4. \nBy the end of 2018, global storage deployment was about 8 gigawatt-hours (GWh) in terms \nof energy capacity, more than double the levels in 2017.4 In Southeast Asia, however, the lack of \npilot projects and a lag in regulatory regimes prevent widespread commercial deployment of the \nbattery storage technology seen in other parts of the world. \n \nIn July 2018, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) received approval from the CTF Trust \n5. \nFund Committee for a $36.1 million private sector subprogram of integrated renewable energy \n\n \n\n1  Financing Partner: Climate Investment Funds.  \n2  Government of Thailand, Ministry of Energy. 2019.

Administered  through  multilateral  development \nbanks, including ADB, CTF is one of the largest funds helping developing countries fill financing \ngaps in climate change mitigation projects. \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED  \n \nProject design. The project consists of a 10 MW wind power project with an integrated \n6. \n1.88  MWh  pilot  BESS.  The  wind  farm  consists  of  four  wind  turbines  from  Xinjiang  Goldwind \nScience and Technology with a rated capacity of 2.5 MW each. The project company entered into \na power purchase agreement (PPA) with the Provincial Electricity Authority (PEA), the Thai state-\nowned utility handling all distribution and retail sales outside the greater Bangkok area, for up to \n8.965 MW under the Ministry of Energy\u2019s very small power producer (VSPP) program. The PPA \nis automatically renewed every 5 years, and in addition to the wholesale tariff, the project receives \na tariff incentive (the so-called \"adder\") of B3.5 per kilowatt-hour (kWh), applicable for 10 years \nfrom the commercial operations date. The wind turbines reached commercial operations in April \n2019. \n \n7. \nThe 1.88 MWh BESS is a small pilot scheme comprising a lithium-ion battery with installed \ncapacity of 731 kWh and an UltraBattery with installed capacity of 1,152 kWh.6 The lithium-ion \nbattery has peak charge and discharge capacity of 731 kilowatts (kW). The UltraBattery has a \npeak  charge  capacity  of  461  kW  and  a  peak  discharge  capacity  of  691  kW.  Combining  these \ntechnologies allows the project to benefit from both the high charge rate, high depth of discharge, \nand high durability of lithium-ion and the low energy capacity cost of the UltraBattery. \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED  \n \nThe project is in southern Thailand, one of the country\u2019s least developed regions, which \n8. \nsuffers  from  lack  of  investment,  job  opportunities,  and  access  to  basic  services.  The  lack  of \neconomic  activity  in  the  region  has  led  to  underinvestment  in  the  local  power  system,  which \ncontinues to experience energy shortages. The project will provide additional generation capacity \nto the region, help make the power network more resilient, and thus support economic growth. \n \n9. \nBorrower and sponsor. Lomligor, the borrower, was set up to own, develop, construct, \nand  operate  the  project.  The  project  is  wholly  owned  by  BCPG,  a  leading  renewable  energy \ncompany in Thailand with 1,132 MW of capacity in operation and 256 MW under development as \nof August 2019. BCPG focuses on investments in renewable energy, including solar, geothermal, \nwind, biogas, and biomass. The project is part of the long-term growth strategy of BCPG, which \naims  to  expand  investments  in  renewable  energy  generation  and  become  one  of  the  leading \nalternative energy companies in Southeast Asia. \n \n10. \nBCPG is a core subsidiary of Bangchak Corporation Public Company Limited and was set \nup  in  2015  when  Bangchak  consolidated  its  renewable  energy  business  into  one  subsidiary. \nBCPG is listed on the Stock Exchange of Thailand with a market capitalization of B36.18 billion.7 \nBangchak is BCPG\u2019s dominant shareholder with a 70% stake, and the Government of Thailand \n\n5  The  CTF  Trust  Fund  Committee  approved  the  proposal  on  20  July  2018  (Climate  Investment  Funds.  DPSP  III: \n\n \n\nIntegrated Renewable Energy and Energy Storage). \n\n6  UltraBattery. \n7  As of 7 October 2019. \n\n2 \n\n \n\n\f3 \n\nDevelopment Impacts, Outcome, and Outputs \n\nindirectly  owns  28%  of  BCPG  through  various  entities.  BCPG  promotes  gender  equality  in  its \nbusiness: 17% of its board members (2 of 12 directors), 43% of its executive managers (3 of 7), \nand 46% of its senior managers (17 of 37) are women. Bangchak is rated A with a stable outlook \nby TRIS Rating. ADB has an existing relationship with BCPG through the Bangchak Solar Power \nProject  approved  in  October  20108  and  the  Provincial  Solar  Power  Project  approved  in  June \n2012.9 \n \nADB  conducted  integrity  due  diligence.10  Lomligor\u2019s  founder,  shareholders,  managers, \n11. \nand major contracting entities do not appear to constitute a significant or potentially significant \nintegrity risk\u2014no unresolved or substantiated adverse media reports or other information related \nto them were found. Tax integrity due diligence was not required.11 \n \nB. \n \n12. \nImpacts. The project is aligned with the following impacts: (i) additional renewable energy \ncapacity developed and (ii) greenhouse gas emissions reduced from projected business-as-usual \nlevel by 2030.12 \n \n13. \nOutcome.  The  project\u2019s  outcome  will  be  the  increased  supply  of  renewable  energy  to \nThailand\u2019s  domestic  grid  and  the  pilot  demonstration  of  an  integrated  BESS.  CONFIDENTIAL \nINFORMATION DELETED. \n \n14. \nOutput. The project has three outputs: (i) a 10 MW wind power plant with integrated pilot \nBESS developed in Thailand; (ii) job opportunities for the local community, including for women, \ngenerated; and (iii) growth in the local and national economy supported. \n \nC. \n \nConsistency with ADB strategy and country strategy. The project is consistent with \n15. \nADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 and its operational priority 3\u2014tackling climate change, building climate and \ndisaster  resilience,  and  enhancing  environmental  sustainability.13  Further,  the  project  supports \ngreater mobilization of private sector participation in infrastructure. ADB\u2019s support for the project \nis in line with its country partnership strategy, 2013\u20132016 and country operations business plan, \n2019\u20132021  for  Thailand,  both  of  which  support  private  sector  development  and  energy \ninfrastructure, and respond to the needs and priorities of an upper-middle-income country.14 \n \nConsistency with sector strategy and ADB operations. The project is consistent with \n16. \nADB\u2019s  Energy  Policy,  which  emphasizes  investments  in  energy  efficiency,  renewable  energy \nprojects, and wider access to energy.15 The project will contribute to ADB\u2019s target of providing \n$80 billion in cumulative financing for climate mitigation and adaptation by 2030. \n\nAlignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n\n \n\n8  ADB.

CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED. \n \n23. \nThe participation of a concessional loan from CTF is necessary to improve the project\u2019s \nbankability and financial viability. Concessional financing increases risk-adjusted returns for the \nsponsor, considering the additional BESS-associated costs and risks. Minimum concessionality \nwas considered with regard to the pricing, size, and structure of the CTF loan, which will rank pari \npassu with ADB\u2019s loan but at a lower interest rate. The use of concessional finance is consistent \nwith the agreed principles of development finance institutions on the use of blended concessional \nfinance for private sector projects.18 \n \nB. \n \nADB adds value by mobilizing a financing package that makes the project bankable on a \n24. \nnonrecourse  basis.  ADB\u2019s  experience  in  complex  technical  due  diligence  was  important  given \nthat this is the first wind power project with an integrated BESS in Thailand. ADB will offer a longer \ntenor than the participating commercial bank to help improve the debt service coverage ratios and \nthereby improve the project\u2019s financial viability. \n \n25. \nSuccessful project financing will help set a precedent in Thailand for wind power projects \nwith an integrated BESS. The demonstration value of the pilot will be instrumental in lowering the \nperception  of  risk  associated  with  a  BESS,  both  in  the  Thai  power  industry  and  among  the \nregulators.  ADB\u2019s  involvement  and  due  diligence  will  ensure  that  the  project  is  operated  to \ninternational best practice standards and will perform to expectations over the project life. ADB\u2019s \nparticipation will also ensure compliance with its environmental and social safeguard standards. \n \nC. \n \n26. \n \n\nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED  \n\nRisks \n\n \n\n18 African  Development  Bank,  ADB,  Asian  Infrastructure  Investment  Bank,  European  Bank  for  Reconstruction  and \nInter-American \nDevelopment,  European  Development  Finance \nDevelopment Bank Group, International Finance Corporation, and Islamic Corporation for the Development of the \nPrivate Sector. 2018.

It also assessed Lomligor\u2019s (i) compliance with \nlocal  regulations;  and  environmental,  health,  safety,  and  social  policies  and  procedures;  and \n(ii) past  and  current  performance  against  the  objectives,  principles,  and  requirements  of  the \nSafeguard Policy Statement. It found the environmental and social measures and the institutional \ncapacity  and  commitment  of  the  borrower  to  manage  the  project\u2019s  social  and  environmental \nimpacts to be adequate. \n \n29. \nAn  independent  and  qualified  consultant  conducted  an  environmental  and  social \ncompliance audit (ESCA) of the operating wind farm project and its associated facilities. The audit \nconfirmed that the site is not in any eco-sensitive zone or area. It did not identify any sensitive \nreceptors with significant environmental value in the project impact area. \n \n30. \nAn initial environmental evaluation (IEE) of the project, conducted in 2015 before it was \nbuilt,20  assessed  the  potential  environmental  impacts  from  its  construction  and  operation  and \nproposed corresponding mitigation measures. The ESCA (i) reviewed the IEE, (ii) assessed in \ndetail the ongoing and past activities at the project site, and (iii) identified gaps in environmental \nand  social  performance.  It  produced  a  corrective  action  plan  to  close  these  gaps  and  ensure \ncompliance with Safeguard Policy Statement requirements, such as upgrading the environmental \nmanagement  plan  in  the  IEE  to  an  operational  environmental  and  social  management  plan \n(ESMP). The ESMP will include a policy, a risk assessment process, environmental and social \ncontrols, monitoring and reporting procedures, stakeholder engagement, social development, and \na grievance redress mechanism that align with the Safeguard Policy Statement. Additionally, the \nborrower will align its labor and gender policies with the applicable regulatory requirements, ADB\u2019s \nSocial Protection Strategy (2001), and internationally recognized core labor standards.21 These \nactions will be detailed in the project corrective action plan. \n \nThe  project  will  not  result  in  physical  or  economic  displacement.  The  land  for  the  wind \n31. \nturbines and associated facilities was privately owned and purchased from 2016 to 2018 through \na willing buyer, willing seller arrangement. The ESCA confirmed that no legacy or current issues, \nnor  dependencies  associated  with  the  project  land  exist.  PEA\u2019s  33-kilovolt  transmission  line  is \n2.6 kilometers long, lies within PEA\u2019s right-of-way and along the public road, and connects the \nproject to the PEA grid. Hence, no involuntary resettlement issues arising from the project were \nfound. The project and its associated facilities are not in an area owned or used by indigenous \npeople, so impacts on indigenous people are not envisaged. \n \n\n \n\n19 ADB.
