Initial  environmental  examinations  were  prepared  for  all \npart  B  activities  in  accordance  with  the  Asian  Development  Bank \n(ADB) Safeguard Policy Statement (2009).  \n \nPart  A  will  finance  consulting  services  to  support  (i)  infrastructure \nservices  reforms  including  performance-based  contracts  for  urban \nservices  delivery,  (ii)  institutional  development  and  capacity  building \nto strengthen urban planning and policy making, (iii) strengthening of \nregional  cooperation,  and  (iv)  project  management  and  project \nperformance monitoring. \n \nPart  B  will  finance  priority  infrastructure  improvements  and  physical \noutputs  including  (i)  water  source  development,  water  transmission, \nstorage,  and  distribution  network,  allowing  increased  connections  to \npiped  water  supply  and  reducing  system  leakage;  (ii)  increased \nwastewater  collection  coverage  and  enhanced  capacity \nfor \nwastewater treatment and effluent reuse; (iii) improved efficiency and \ncoverage  of  district  heating  services;  (iv)  improved  storm  water \ndrainage; (v) surfaced central road networks; and (vi) development of \ncontrolled solid-waste landfills and enhanced capacity for solid-waste \ncollection. \n \nThe  aimags  (provinces)  of  Omnogovi  and  Dornogovi  (Southeast \nGobi) are poised to experience a rapid increase in economic activity \nas  a  result  of  rapid  growth  in  mining  and  cross-border  trade.  The \ninflux  associated  with  these  economic  activities  is  projected  to  more \nthan double urban populations in the project towns by 2020. For some \nsoum  (district)  centers  in  Southeast  Gobi,  population  is  expected  to \nincrease by an order of magnitude by 2020.  \n \nThe  provision  of  urban  infrastructure  and  services  is  currently  poor \nand  is  not  keeping  pace  with  population  growth.  Many  services  are \neither inadequate or absent. There are low levels of access to water \nsupply  and  sanitation,  and  smaller  urban  areas  do  not  have  piped \nnetworks.  Insufficient  and  unreliable  urban  services  add  to  business \nand  household  costs,  damage  the  urban  environment  and  diminish \nquality  of  life,  and  decrease  the  attractiveness  of  towns  to  further \n\n\fii \n\n \n\n \nImpact and Outcome \n\n \nProject Investment \nPlan  \n \nFinancing Plan \n\n \nPeriod of Utilization \n\n \nEstimated Project \nCompletion Date \n \nExecuting Agency \n\ninvestments, \n\nfrom  mining \n\npotential  investment.  Investment  and  capacity  development  are \nrequired to enable government to expand the coverage and improve \nthe quality and reliability of urban services. Local governments are ill-\nequipped to meet the joint challenges posed by increased demand for \nscarce water resources. \n \nMaximizing the benefits to existing and future residents of Southeast \nGobi \ntrade  growth,  and  associated \neconomic  development  opportunities  depends  on  effective  urban \nplanning,  management,  and  service  delivery  policies  and  structures \nbeing  in  place.  Strengthening  the  provision  of  basic  urban  services \nwill  require  institutions  and  policies  that  provide  incentives  for \nperformance  while  also  ensuring  affordability.  Services  are  currently \nprovided by utilities that are largely owned by local government, and \nare  delivered  at  a  loss  due  to  unwillingness  of  local  government \ncouncils to raise tariffs to cost-recovery levels. This is costly in terms \nof  the  resources  spent  on  untargeted  subsidies  and  foregone \nopportunities to attract private sector expertise and financing. \n \nThe  impact  of  the  project  will  be  enhanced  economic  development \nand  livability  in  aimag  centers  and  mining  and  border  towns  in \nSoutheast  Gobi.  The  outcome  of  the  project  will  be  improved  urban \ngovernance,  and  expanded  access  to  sustainable  infrastructure  and \nservices in urban places in Southeast Gobi. \n \nThe  total  cost  of  the  project  is  estimated  at  $21.9  million  equivalent, \nincluding duties and taxes of about $1.99 million. \n \n\nFinancing Plan \n($ million) \n\nSource \nAsian Development Bank  \nGovernment of Mongolia \nAimag governments \nTotal \n\nTotal \nCost \n15.0 \n6.8 \n0.1 \n21.9 \n\n%\n68.6\n30.9\n0.5\n100.0\n\n \nADB  will  provide  a  grant  of  $15  million  equivalent  from  its  Special \nFunds resources to cover 68.6% of the total project cost. Duties and \ntaxes are estimated at $1.99 million. A domestic contribution of $6.90 \nmillion  equivalent  is  required,  which  will  comprise  $6.80 million \nequivalent from the Government of Mongolia and $0.1 million in-kind \nfrom the participating aimag governments.  \n \nThe  project  will  be  implemented  over  4.5  years  beginning  in  June \n2010. The period of utilization will be up to 31 May 2015.  \n \n30 November 2014 \n \n \nMinistry  of  Road,  Transportation,  Construction  and  Urban \n\n\fiii \n\nDevelopment (MRTCUD) \n \nThe  MRTCUD  will  be  the  executing  agency,  supported  by  a  project \nmanagement unit (PMU) headed by a project director. The MRTCUD \nwill  be  responsible  for  strategic  guidance,  technical  supervision  and \nexecution,  and  ensuring  compliance  with  grant  covenants. \nImplementation  of  the  priority  infrastructure  development  component \n(part  B)  will  be  carried  out  by  the  aimag  governments.  Project \nimplementation units (PIUs) will be established in each aimag and will \nbe  responsible  for  day-to-day  implementation  of  physical  works.  The \nMRTCUD  will  coordinate  the  activities  of  the  two  PIUs  at  the  aimag \nlevel through consultants and PMU staff, and will facilitate processing \nand approvals of designs, contracts, and other documents as required \nat  ministry  level.  The  project  director,  supported  by  the  PMU  and \nconsultants,  will  coordinate  all  activities  under  the  project  and  be \nresponsible for overall project execution, monitoring, and supervision. \n \nA  project  steering  committee  will  be  established  with  full  powers  to \ntake  decisions  on  matters  relating  to  project  implementation.  The \nproject  director  will  be  the  member  secretary  of  the  project  steering \ncommittee,  which  will  be  chaired  by  the  state  secretary  of  the \nMRTCUD.  Members  of  the  committee  will  include  the  chair  of  the \nState  Property  Committee;  chair  of  the  National  Development  and \nInnovation  Committee;  director  of  the  Budget  Policy  Department  of \nthe Ministry of Finance; and representatives of the Ministry of Nature, \nEnvironment and Tourism, Ministry of Mineral Resources and Energy, \nthe  MRTCUD,  and  the  aimag  governments  of  Dornogovi  and \nOmnogovi. \n \nProcurement  financed  from  the  ADB  grant  will  be  carried  out  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as  amended \nfrom  time  to  time).  International  competitive  bidding  (ICB)  will  be \napplied  to  supply  contracts  estimated  to  cost  $500,000  or  more. \nSupply  contracts  with  a  value  less  than  $500,000  will  follow  national \ncompetitive  bidding  (NCB),  and  those  less  than  $100,000  will  follow \nshopping  procedures  as  reflected  by  particular  circumstances  of  the \ncontract packages. ICB will be used for civil works contracts valued at \n$1 million or more. Civil works contracts valued at less than $1 million \nbut more than $100,000 will be procured using NCB procedures. The \nselection  and  engagement  of  contractors  will  be  subject  to  ADB \napproval. Before commencement of NCB procurement, ADB and the \nrecipient will review the recipient\u2019s procurement procedures to ensure \nconsistency  with  ADB \nrequirements.  Any  modifications  or \nclarifications  to  the  recipient\u2019s  procedures  will  be  documented  in  the \nprocurement  plan.  Any  internationally  tendered  equipment  packages \nwill  include  the  technical  support  for  ensuring  proper  installation, \ntesting, commissioning, and training of operational staff as part of the \nrelated  contracts.  In  accordance  with  ADB  requirements,  foreign \ncontractors may participate in bidding for NCB contracts.  \n \nConsultants  will  be  selected  and  engaged  using  ADB\u2019s  quality-  and \n\n \n\n \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\n \nProcurement \n\n \nConsulting Services \n\n \n\n\fiv \n\n \n\n \nProject Benefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\nin \n\nproject \n\nimplementation \n\ninternational  consultants  will  have  expertise \n\ncost-based  selection  procedures,  consultant  qualification  selection, \nand/or  individual  consultant  selection  procedures.  The  project  will \nrequire  a  total  of  about  80  person-months  of  international  and  350 \nperson-months of national consulting services to support (i) the PMU \nand  management; \nand  PIUs \n(ii) development  of  structure  plans  for  all  project  towns;  (iii)  an \nimproved  institutional  and  incentive  framework  for  urban  service \ndelivery; (iv) improved local government capacity for urban planning, \nland  management  system  planning,  operation,  and  maintenance; \n(v) enhanced cost recovery from services through metering and tariff \nreform;  and  (vi) improved  local  government  revenues  and  financial \nmanagement  through  the  establishment  of  predictable  recurrent \nfinancing  and  performance-based  contracting  and  private  sector \nparticipation.  \n \nThe \nin  project \n(including  performance-based \nmanagement  and  procurement \ncontracting),  urban  and  regional  planning,  financial  management, \ninstitutional  and  organizational  development,  and  capacity  building \nand training. The national consultants will have expertise in water and \nwastewater  engineering,  resettlement,  environmental  management, \nlegal  aspects,  database  development,  financial  management,  and \nconstruction supervision and engineering design. The consultants will \nbe selected and engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the \nUse  of  Consultants  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  All \ninternational  consultants  and  the  national  consultants  for  project \nmanagement  will  be  selected  and  contracted \nindividually. \nInternational  and  national  consultants  for  developing  service  lease \nagreements  and  contract  preparation,  urban  planning  reform,  and \nreference  design  and  preparing  tender  documents  for  design-and-\nbuild  contracts  will  be  selected  and  contracted  as  firms  using  ADB\u2019s \nquality-  and  cost-based  selection  procedure  among  short-listed \ninternational and national consulting firms.  \n \nThe  project  will  directly  benefit  about  100,000  people  in  six  towns  in \nOmnogovi and Dornogovi aimags, of whom approximately 30.7% live \nline.  The  project  components  have  strong \nbelow \neconomic rationale since they provide minimum acceptable standards \nfor basic living conditions and assist in removing existing constraints \non  social  development  and  economic  growth.  Similarly,  priority \ninfrastructure improvements were designed in accordance with sound \nprinciples  based  on  need,  consultation  and  targeting,  and  demand \nmanagement.  The  project  supports \nrehabilitation  before  new \ninvestment,  and  infrastructure  improvements  represent  technically \nfeasible options at least cost. There will be qualitative improvement in \nthe  lives  of  the  communities,  in  particular  those  living  in  ger \n(traditional felt tent) areas. Living conditions will improve at individual \nand  communal  levels  due  to  improved  health  and  reduced  water \ncollection  times.  The  benefits  are  disproportionately  directed  toward \nwomen  who  bear  most  of  the  burden  associated  with  poor  service \ndelivery.  Women  will  also  benefit  from  employment  opportunities \n\nthe  poverty \n\n\fv \n\nfocusing \n\nduring construction, and enhanced roles in local governance. \n \nThe  2008  joint  country  portfolio  performance  review  and  a  2008  risk \nassessment for the education and urban infrastructure sectors noted \nthe key sector risks as poor capital investment and budget planning, \nunderdeveloped  institutional  frameworks  and  poor  capacity,  lack  of \nmonitoring  and  evaluation,  poor  procurement  integrity,  and  weak \nnational  contractors.  The  proposed  project  addresses  these  risks  by \n(i)  building  national  and  local  government  investment  planning \ncapacity,  (ii)  building  the  capacity  of  local  service  institutions  with \nincreased  private  sector  participation,  (iii) \ninstitutional \nchange  on  measuring  and  improving  service  delivery  performance, \n(iv)  adopting  a  design-and-build  modality  for  procurement  of  priority \ninfrastructure improvements to attract better-qualified contractors, and \n(v)  combining  individual  civil  works  activities  into  larger  contract \npackages  to  generate  economies  of  scale  and  create  packages  that \nare eligible for ICB.  \n \nIt  is  assumed  that  anticipated  demand  for  urban  infrastructure \nservices  in  the  project  towns  will  materialize,  mining  developments \nwill  continue,  and  major  mining  companies  will  remain  committed  to \nforms  of  mine  development  that  support  urban  development  in \nneighboring  towns.  It  is  further  assumed  that  government  policy \ncontinues to allow free movement of people to the project areas. \n \nGovernment  policies  on  public\u2013private  partnerships  for  the  provision \nof  municipal  services  are  central  to  project  sustainability  and \noutcomes.  It  is  assumed  that  proposed  reforms  to  service  delivery \ninstitutions  in  aimag  and  soum  centers  will  be  supported,  and \ncontracts for operation of municipal services will proceed and will be \nsupported  by  a  viable  independent  regulatory  mechanism.  It  is \nassumed that the domestic private sector will participate in operation \nmanagement contracts for service delivery.  \n \nThe project does not have any particular technical risks. Conventional \nengineering  designs  with  proven  records  of  reliable  performance  are \nadopted  for  water  supply,  wastewater  management,  solid-waste \nmanagement,  and  roads.  The  proposed  packaging  of  priority \ninfrastructure  improvements  under  part  B  will  provide  for  contracts \nthat qualify for ICB and attract better-qualified contractors. \n\n \n\n \nRisks and \nAssumptions \n\n \n\n\f96  00'Eo\n\no\n111  00'E\n\nR  U  S  S  I  A  N        F  E  D  E  R  A  T  I  O  N\n\nMONGOLIA\nSOUTHEAST GOBI\nURBAN AND BORDER TOWN DEVELOPMENT PROJECT\n\n50  00'No\n\nUlaanbayshint\n\nUlaangom\n\nUVS\n\nTsengel\n\nNogoonnuur\n\nNaranbulag\n\nTes\n\nDayan\n\nBAYAN-\nOLGIY\n\nOlgiy\n\nOlgiy\n\nTudevtey\n\nHovd\n\nZAVHAN\n\nTsagaan-Uul\n\nMoron\n\nBULGAN\n\nSuhbaatar\n\nHutag-Ondor\n\nErdenet\n\nSelenge\n\nBulgan\n\nORHON\n\nSumber\n\nAltanbulag\n\nSELENGE\nDarhan\n\nDARHAN-UUL\n\nHanh\n\nHatgal\n\nHOVSGOL\n\nEreentsav\n\nBayan-Uul\n\nDORNOD\n\nHavirga\n\nManhan\n\nDariv\n\nTsahir\n\nUliastay\n\nYarant\n\nHOVD\n\nUyench\n\nTayshir\n\nARHANGAY\n\nHishig Ondor\n\nBattsengel\n\nTsetserleg\n\nHarhorin\n\nAltay\n\nBayanhongor\n\nTogrog\n\nBuutsagaan\n\nArvayheer\n\nGOVI-ALTAY\n\nNariynteel\nOVORHANGAY\n\nBurgastay\n\nBAYANHONGOR\n\nHENTIY\n\nChoybalsan\n\nLun\n\nULAANBAATAR\n\nBaganuur\n\nBatnorov\n\nTOV\nZuunmod\n\nNalayh\n\nMaanit\n\nOndorhaan\n\nMonhhaan\n\nMatad\n\nTamsagbulag\n\nGOVISUMBER\n\nChoyr\n\nBaruun-Urt\n\nErdenetsagaan\n\nBichigt\n\nSUHBAATAR\n\nMandalgovi\n\nDUNDGOVI\n\nTsogt-Ovoo\n\nSaynshand\n\nDORNOGOVI\n\nZamyn-Uud\n\nGurvantes\n\nDalanzadgad\n\nTsogttsetsii\n\nOMNOGOVI\n\nHanbogd\n\nBayan-Ovoo\n\nGashuun Suhayt\n\nPEOPLE'S  REPUBLIC\nOF  CHINA \n\n50  00'No\n\n42  00'No\n\nProject Aimag\n\nProject Town\n\nNational Capital\n\nAimag Capital\n\nCity/Town\n\nMain Road\n\nProvincial Road\n\nRailway\n\nRiver\n\nAimag Boundary\n\nInternational Boundary\n\nBoundaries are not necessarily authoritative.\n\no\n111  00'E\n\n42  00'No\n\nN\n\n0\n\n50 100\n\n150\n\n200 250\n\nKilometers\n\n0\n9\n-\n4\n6\n7\n8\n \nH\nR\n\n96  00'Eo\n\n\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n1. \nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed grant \nto Mongolia for the Southeast Gobi Urban and Border Town Development Project. The design \nand monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n  \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nA. \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n2. \nThe  aimags  (provinces)  of  Omnogovi  and  Dornogovi  (Southeast  Gobi)  are  poised  to \nexperience a rapid increase in economic activity as a result of (i) planned development of new \nmines  at  Tavan  Tolgoi,  Oyu  Tolgoi,  and  Tsagaan  Suvarga;  (ii)  expansion  of  existing  mining \noperations at Naryn Suhayt and Ovoo Tolgoi and other locations; (iii) development of associated \npower  stations  and  transport  infrastructure;  and  (iv)  strengthening  of  trade  corridors  with  the \nPeople's  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  through  the  border  town  at  Zamyn-Uud  in  Dornogovi,  and \nthrough  crossing  points  of  Gashuun  Suhayt  and  Shivee  Huren  in  Omnogovi,  and  Hangi  in \nDornogovi.  \n \n3. \nThe  influx  associated  with  these  economic  activities  is  projected  to  more  than  double \nurban  populations  in  the  project  towns  by  2020.  For  some  soum1 centers  in  Southeast  Gobi \n(notably Hanbogd and Tsogttsetsii), population is expected to increase about tenfold by 2020. \nThe  population  of  Zamyn-Uud,  currently  at  about  10,000,  is  expected  to  more  than  double  by \n2020. \n \n4. \nEffective  urban  infrastructure  and  services  are  prerequisites  for  sustainable  economic \ngrowth. In the urban areas of Southeast Gobi, many services are either inadequate or absent. \nThe population has low levels of access to water supply and sanitation, and the smaller urban \nareas  do  not  have  piped  networks.  Reticulated  water  supply  networks  and  sewerage  systems \nserve  only  the  formal  areas  of  the  aimag  centers  and  Zamyn-Uud  soum;  the  majority  of  the \npopulation in these towns lives in ger (traditional felt tent) areas and do not benefit from network \nservices (except through water kiosks). In other soum centers, water is only available from well \npoints, and there are no sewerage systems. \n \n5. \nStrengthening the provision of basic urban services will require institutions and policies \nthat provide incentives for performance while also ensuring affordability. Services are currently \nprovided by utilities that are largely owned by local government, and are delivered at a loss due \nto  unwillingness  of  local  government  councils  to  raise  tariffs  to  cost-recovery  levels.  This  is \ncostly in terms of resources spent on untargeted subsidies and foregone opportunities to attract \nprivate sector expertise and financing. The government is developing legislation that will enable \nefficient  delivery  of  municipal  services,  introducing  accountability  and  independent  regulation. \nThe Asian Development Bank (ADB) has provided technical assistance for preparing legislation \non public\u2013private partnerships (PPPs). The proposed project will support these reforms. \n \nLess than 30% of the urban population has adequate water service, and only 17% has \n6. \naccess to adequate sanitation services. The daily household water consumption in ger areas is \n5\u201310 liters per capita per day (lpcd), much less than the minimum of 25 lpcd recommended by \n\n                                                 \n1 A  soum  is  the  administrative  unit  immediately  below  an  aimag  (province).  Each  aimag  comprises  a  number  of \nsoums, at the center of which is a soum center\u2014comprising several administrative buildings and a small population.  \n\n\fthe  World  Health  Organization.  There  are  high  levels  of  unaccounted-for  water  from  the \nnetworks (about 40% of water produced).  \n \n7. \nEconomic developments are set to take place in a sparsely populated and largely poor \narea.  The  aimags  of  Dornogovi  and  Omnogovi  are  located  within  the  central  region,  which \ncontains significant numbers of poor households. In Omnogovi, where disaggregated data are \navailable, the percentage of households living below the poverty line in Dalanzadgad is 21%\u2013\n26%,  in  Hanbogd  soum  it  is  estimated  at  15%\u201325%,  and  in  Tsogttsetsii  soum  it  is  13%\u201326%. \nHouseholds headed by women are more likely to be poor, and form a significant proportion of \nthe total households living below the poverty line in Southeast Gobi.  \n \nB. \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\n8. \nRapid population growth. Southeast Gobi is set to experience rapid growth in its urban \npopulation. In Omnogovi, the mining sector could require up to 7,000 new employees by 2015 \nand  an  additional  10,000  by  2020.  Many  mine  workers  and  their  families,  small  business \nowners, and others attracted to this high-growth area will locate outside mine fences in existing \nurban settlements. The major mining companies support a mixed model of operations whereby \nsome  employees  are  transported  in  and  out  of  the  mine  site  from  afar,  while  others  live  in \nnearby settlements. The population at the three border-crossing points of Gashuun Suhayt and \nShivee Huren in Omnogovi, and Hangi in Dornogovi is expected to grow quickly. In Dornogovi, \nthe  cross-border  trade  with  the  PRC  at  the  Zamyn-Uud\u2013Erlian  rail  crossing  point  has  been \nincreasing  at  a  rate  of  26%  per  year  in  recent  years.  The  completion  of  the  Ulaanbaatar  to \nZamyn-Uud road link and planned investments in logistics facilities at Zamyn-Uud will serve to \nsignificantly increase cross-border trade and result in a population influx.  \n \n9. \nUncoordinated  framework  for  subregional  development.  Efforts  to  reach  a  clear \npolicy and strategic framework for the future development of the urban sector in Southeast Gobi \nare  compromised  by  institutional  fragmentation  and  a  lack  of  consensus  across  government \ndepartments  and  other  stakeholders.  The  National  Development  and  Innovation  Committee \n(NDIC)  and  the  Ministry  of  Road,  Transportation,  Construction  and  Urban  Development \n(MRTCUD) are carrying out work on aspects of the subregional strategy. The MRTCUD is in the \nprocess  of  finalizing  a  development  plan  for  the  Gobi  region  covering  Omnogovi,  Dornogovi, \nand  Dundgovi  aimags,  while  simultaneously  undergoing  reorganization  in  an  attempt  to  better \nalign  its  functions  to  the  requirements  of  the  sector.  The  prioritization  and  sequencing  of \ninvestment  remains  unclear,  and  many  proposals  under  consideration  have  not  identified  any \nimmediate  or  future  source  of  funding.  The  government  expects  to  establish  a  regional \ndevelopment council to coordinate investments in Omnogovi and possibly other aimags. \n \n10. \nPoor  urban  planning.  Translating  economic  activity  and  population  growth  into  real \nbenefits for residents of Southeast Gobi will depend on the development of livable urban places. \nThis, in turn, requires effective urban planning and a framework for the provision of high-quality \nmunicipal  services.  The  project  will  address  these  needs  by  supporting  priority  investments, \ninstitutional  reform,  and  capacity  development.  The  aimag  and  soum  centers  are  poorly \nequipped  to  deal  with  the  impact  that  rapid  growth  from  mining  and  trade  will  have  on  their \nplanning systems, infrastructure, and services. Although master plans have been prepared for \nsome of the project towns, these are based on past natural population growth trends and do not \naccommodate  the  populations  now  anticipated  as  a  result  of  the  projected  influx.  It  is  unclear \nhow  proposed  investments  will  be  financed,  and  the  institutional  strengthening,  capacity \nbuilding, and reform needed to ensure that the plans are effectively executed and services are \nwell managed have not been addressed. \n\n2 \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \nThe rapid allocation of land for khashaas (land plots) based on the Law on the Allocation \n11. \nof  Land  to  Mongolian  Citizens  has  resulted  in  land  being  allocated  in  a  way  that  bears  little \nrelation to the provisions of town master plans.2 Demands for land for housing and commercial \nuses  are  increasing  rapidly  and  are  overwhelming  the  capacity  of  local  governments  to  deal \neffectively with them, resulting in poorly planned development and adding to the eventual costs \nof  servicing  developments.  Competing  and  conflicting  land  uses  and  the  limited  amount  of \ndevelopable land in Zamyn-Uud is already resulting in major development challenges, which will \nbe repeated in the other high-growth towns unless better tools and systems are put in place.  \n \n12. \nConstrained  local  resources. The aimag governments of Southeast Gobi, in common \nwith those elsewhere in the country, lack fiscal autonomy. In a system set out in the 2003 Public \nSector Management and Finance Law, aimag government revenues comprise taxes decided by \nthe  assemblies,  shared  taxes,  and  nontax  revenues.  Aimag  governments  have  few  revenue-\nraising powers; local taxes, corporate income tax, and excises, which were shared before 2003, \nare  now  retained  by  the  central  government.  Value-added  tax  is  shared,  but  the  proportion  is \ndecided annually by the central government. All taxes are collected by the General Department \nfor  National  Taxation  and  then  transferred  to  subnational  governments.  Local  governments \nrequire  regular  and  predictable  income  to  cover  establishment  and  operational  costs  and  to \nprovide funding for local development. A more formalized allocation process that is transparent, \nsustainable, and predictable is required.  \n \n13. \nStruggling service institutions. Aimag-owned urban services companies, called public \nurban service organizations (PUSOs),3 have difficulty maintaining existing levels of service and \nare  not  in  a  position  to  expand  service  coverage  to  meet  expected  demand  for  services  and \ninfrastructure. They are guided in part by management contracts with the aimag, which describe \ngeneral responsibilities but lack specificity on service quality and coverage, dispute resolution, \nand remuneration. Soum governments have departments (mini-PUSOs) that are responsible for \nsmall-scale  heating  and  water  operations.  The  PUSOs  and  mini-PUSOs  struggle  to  recover \noperating  and  maintenance  costs  and  lack  access  to  training  and  managerial  expertise.  The \nmost  fundamental  constraint  is  low  tariffs;  PUSO  requests  for  increases  to  enable  routine \noperating  and  maintenance  costs  to  be  recovered  are  often  rejected  by  the  aimag  Citizens' \nRepresentatives  Khural 4  due  to  the  political  unpopularity  of  such  adjustments. 5  Under  the \nproposed  project  there  is  an  opportunity  to  introduce  a  new  arrangement  for  tariff  formulation, \nwhereby  they  are  set  through  competitively  awarded  contracts  with  the  private  sector  and \nregulated by a central independent body.  \n  \n14. \nOperational  performance  of  institutions  responsible  for  delivering  urban  services  varies \nbut  is  generally  characterized  by  low  levels  of  access, inefficiency,  and  deficiencies  in  quality. \nFor example, less than one-third of the population in the project towns has access to household \nwater supply and district heating. The daily household water consumption in ger areas is 5\u201310 \nlpcd,  much  less  than  the  25  lpcd  minimum  recommended  by  the  World  Health  Organization. \nWater losses are very high, estimated at 20%\u201340% of water produced, and energy losses from \n\n                                                 \n2   Government of Mongolia. 2003. Law on the Allocation of Land to Mongolian Citizens. Ulaanbaatar, revised 2008. \n3   The  PUSO  of  Dornogovi  is  entirely  owned  by  the  aimag  government,  while  that  of  Omnogovi  is  51%  owned  by \n\naimag government and 49% by the private sector. \n\n4  The Citizens' Representative Khural is the parliamentary body at the aimag level. \n5   The Dornogovi aimag PUSO cross-subsidizes water and sanitation service using revenues from the district heating \nservice;  the  Omnogovi  PUSO  does  the  same  using  revenues  from  other  business  activities.  The  PUSOs  also \ncross-subsidize between customer groups, charging institutional or ger customers more than the cost of service so \nas to subsidize household customers. \n\n \n\n3\n\n \n\n\fheating  systems  are  estimated  at  40%  or  more.  Although  water  quality  is  generally  good,  raw \nwater  often  has  a  high  mineral  content.  There  are  also  reported  health  problems  due  to \ncontamination  from  pit  latrines  or  leaking  sewerage  lines.  Sewage  is  often  left  untreated. \nStaffing  levels  in  the  PUSOs  are  much  higher  than  what  would  be  expected  at  an  efficiently \nmanaged water, heating, and sanitation utility. \n \n15. \nThe project presents an opportunity to introduce fundamental changes to the institutional \nframework for municipal service  provision and its regulation. Recent technical assistance from \nADB  has  yielded  recommendations,  developed  in  cooperation  with  SPC,  MRTCUD,  and  the \nMinistry of Finance (MOF), including (i) divesting all or part of PUSOs so as to decouple service \nproviders  from  local  government  administration  and  attract  private  capital  and  expertise;  (ii) \nintroducing  a  lease  contract  that  provides  performance-based  incentives  for  the  service \nprovider; and (iii) establishing a regulatory mechanism at a central level, which links tariffs with \nthe prices of key inputs, avoids political involvement in tariff setting, and reduces the regressive \nnature  of  the  current  tariff  structure  whereby  residents  of  formal  areas  pay  less  than  their \nneighbors in ger areas. These steps will be supported under the project, with a view to driving \nchanges in other aimags over time. \n \n16. \nInadequate infrastructure and service provision. The quality, coverage, and reliability \nof  urban  services  within  the  project  aimag  and  soum  centers  vary  widely.  Less  than  30%  of \nurban  households  within  the  aimags  have  access  to  household  water  supply  and  district \nheating. Still less have access to sanitary sewerage. The ger areas in the aimag centers and in \nZamyn-Uud rely on water from water kiosks and on-plot sanitation, and the low levels of water \nconsumption and poor sanitation increase the risk of waterborne and water-washed diseases. In \nthe other soum centers, there are no piped water supply and wastewater systems; all residents \nrely on wells and pit latrines. \n \n17. \nSolid-waste  collection  management  and  disposal  systems  are  generally  nonexistent  or \nat  best  rudimentary  in  the  aimag  and  soum  centers.  It  is  estimated  that  less  than  50%  of  the \npopulation is served by a regular garbage collection system, including some handled by small \nprivate operators engaged by the soum governments. No secure sanitary landfills exist, and the \nsolid waste collected is disposed of onto open sites. This causes pollution through the spreading \nof waste. Wind-blown plastic bags are becoming a feature of the Gobi Desert landscape.  \n \n18. \nThe absence of an extensive paved road network in the aimag centers and any paved \nroads  at  all  in  most  of  the  soum  centers  prevents  clear  definition  of  rights  of  way  and  major \ncirculation  routes.  The  dust  which  is  generated  by  vehicles  riding  on  the  unpaved  dirt  roads \ncontributes to air pollution and has a negative impact on quality of life. \n \n19. \nUnderinvestment  in  infrastructure,  and  shortcomings  in  its  operation  and  maintenance, \nraises  costs  for  businesses  and  restricts  access  to  jobs  and  services.  There  are  significant \ndisparities  in  the  level  of  services  provided  in  formal  planned  areas  in  these  towns  and  the \nadjacent  ger  areas.  The  urban  poor  suffer  disproportionately  from  inadequate  provision, \nmanagement,  and  maintenance  of  urban  infrastructure.  They  are  exposed  to  risks  associated \nwith  deficient  service  provision;  they  lack  adequate  means  to  avoid  the  effects  of  poor  water \nsupply, \nthe  most  severely \ndisadvantaged  by  the  absence  of  suitable  roads.  The  poor  stand  to  benefit  significantly  from \nimproved infrastructure and service provision.  \n \n20. \nPoor  cross-border  cooperation.  The  potential  benefits  of  close  cross-border \ncooperation  are  compromised  by  the  lack  of  effective  cross-border  institutions  and  an \n\ninsufficient  heating,  and  are \n\ninadequate  sanitation,  and \n\n4 \n\n \n\n \n\n\fassociated  lack  of  investment  on  the  Mongolian  side.  Action  is  required  to  narrow  the  gaps  in \ntrade  logistics  and  urban  infrastructure  development  as  well  as  in  the  associated  trade \nprocesses. The unevenness of development is contributing to delays which are to the detriment \nof growth in cross-border trade. As delays occur, higher trade-related transaction costs worsen \nthe opportunity to handle increasing volumes of trade and there is less incentive for investment. \n \n21. \nPrior external assistance. Several development partners are active in the urban sector \nin Mongolia, notably the World Bank (integrated urban development, ger area development, and \nurban  air  quality),  Japan  International  Cooperation  Agency  (water  supply,  and  urban  planning \nand  transport  in  Ulaanbaatar),  and  German  development  cooperation  through  GTZ  (urban \nenvironment  and  energy  efficiency).  The  World  Bank  prepared  the  Southern  Mongolia \nInfrastructure Strategy6 in 2008\u20132009, which focused on infrastructure and institutional needs in \nOmnogovi  and  brought  stakeholders  together  to  discuss  these.  It  is  preparing  a  technical \nassistance  project  that  will  strengthen  groundwater  monitoring  and  support  development  of \ntransactions  for  private  sector  participation  in  infrastructure.  Appendix  3  provides  more  details \non development coordination in the sector.  \n \nADB  is  supporting  several  ongoing  and  planned  activities  in  Southeast  Gobi.  About \n22. \n$1.3 million  has  been  expended  on  rehabilitating  urban  services \nin  Saynshand  and \nDalanzadgad.  More  than  $1  million  has  been  invested  in  Omnogovi  aimag  and  $0.5  million  in \nDornogovi  aimag  for  rehabilitating  schools,  providing  textbooks  and  tool  kits,  and  training \nteachers;  and  $1.3  million  has  been  invested  in  Dornogovi  aimag  for  rehabilitating  and \nconstructing  aimag  and  soum  hospitals,  capacity  building  and  training,  and  providing  medical \nequipment and motorbikes. In 2009, an advisory technical assistance project began supporting \nHIV/AIDS  prevention  in  ADB  infrastructure  projects  and  the  mining  sector.  An  ADB-financed \nproject  preparatory  technical  assistance  project is  currently supporting  the  development  of  the \nRegional  Logistics  Development  Project  for  trade  logistics  facilities  at  Zamyn-Uud,  and \nsupplementary  financing  for  the  Regional  Road  Development  Project  to  complete  the  road \ncorridor between Zamyn-Uud and Choyr is expected to begin in April 2010. \n \n23. \nLessons. Institutional weakness is a key constraint on timely and efficient execution of \nprojects  and  on  long-term  sustainability  of  the  assets  created.  Local  capacity  constraints  are \nexacerbated  by  a  highly  centralized  system  of  government  in  which  local  infrastructure \ninvestments  remain  largely  at  the  discretion  of  the  central  government,  and  local  officials  lack \nthe budgetary and human resources to properly maintain infrastructure and effectively respond \nto  constituents'  needs.  Incentives  and  resources  for  local  governments  to  strengthen  services \nare  limited.  The  proposed  project  addresses  the  opportunity  for  greater  local  involvement  in \nproject  planning,  design,  and  implementation,  and  the  issue  of  capacity  constraints  and  poor \nincentives  for  quality  service  provision  at  the  local  level.  In  adopting  a  design-and-build \nprocurement  modality,  the  project  eliminates  problems  experienced  in  prior  ADB  loans  where \nthere is difficulty in assigning responsibility for deficiencies when infrastructure is turned over to \nlocal authorities.      \n \n24. \nProjects  have  had  only  limited  and  variable  success  in  raising  tariffs,  resulting  in \nunderfunding of operation and maintenance. The support of ADB and other donors has focused \non rebuilding assets in a variety of urban subsectors, but has placed less emphasis on building \nthe  institutions  and  systems  required  to  ensure  these  assets  are  maintained  and  operated \nefficiently.  Given  the  acute  needs  in  urban  areas  in  the  1990s,  the  emphasis  on  building  and \nrehabilitating  assets  was  justified.  Today,  it  is  clear  that  Mongolia  lags  behind  other  former \n\n                                                 \n6 World Bank, 2009, Southern Mongolia Infrastructure Strategy Report, Washington DC \n\n \n\n5\n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\n \n\nsocialist  countries  in  institutional  reform  and  strengthening,  and  risks  wasting  resources  on \ninfrastructure  that  is  not  well  maintained  and  managed.  Appendix  2  provides  more  details  on \nchallenges and opportunities in the urban sector.  \n \nLink to government and ADB strategies. The project will be included in the Mongolia \n25. \ncountry  partnership  strategy  and  has  been  prepared  based  on  (i)  the  National  Development \nStrategy  and  ADB-supported  urban  sector  road  map;  (ii)  the  World  Bank-supported  report  on \nthe Southern Mongolia Infrastructure Strategy (and particularly sections on housing and urban \ninfrastructure);  (iii)  the  government\u2019s  draft  Infrastructure  Development  Plans  for  the  Southern \nGobi  prepared  by  the  NDIC; 7 (iv)  planned  logistics  infrastructure  development  at  Zamyn-Uud \nand other border crossings; (v) the land management plan for the \u201cGalbyn Gobi\u201d micro-regional \ndevelopment  concept  prepared  under  the  guidance  of  the  MRTCUD;  (vi)  urban  development \nmaster  plans  and  investment  plans  prepared  for  aimag  centers  and  key  soum  centers  in  the \nregion; and (vii) meetings and workshops with government officials, the private sector, and other \nstakeholders including town residents. \n \nAn urban development road map for the region has been prepared, which sets out the \n26. \ndevelopment  goals  and  objectives  for  urban  development  for  2010  to  2015,  and  identifies \ninvestments  to  achieve  these  objectives.  Based  on  the  road  map,  an  institutional  reform  and \ndevelopment  framework  has  been  developed  which  will  support  effective  planning,  financing, \nand  operation  of  urban  infrastructure  and  services.  This  sets  out  specific  reforms,  associated \ncapacity  development,  and  a  timetable  for  implementation.  Emphasis  is  placed  on  improving \nlocal governance and urban planning and management capacity, improving the institutional and \ncontractual  arrangements  for  service  provision,  enhancing  national  and  local  urban  planning \nsystems  and  capacities,  and  minimizing  recurrent  expenditures  and  establishing  clear \naccountability for the performance of contractors and service providers. \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n27. \nThe impact of the project will be enhanced economic development and livability in aimag \ncenters  and  mining  and  border  towns  in  Southeast  Gobi.  The  outcome  of  the  project  will  be \nimproved urban governance8 and expanded access to sustainable infrastructure and services in \nurban places in Southeast Gobi. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \n \nB. \n\nOutputs \n\nTo achieve these outcomes, the project will include two parts: institutional and capacity \n\n28. \ndevelopment, and priority infrastructure improvements. \n \n29. \nPart  A  will  finance  consulting  services  to  support  (i)  infrastructure  services  reforms \nincluding performance-based contracts for urban services delivery, (ii) institutional development \nand  capacity  building  to  strengthen  urban  planning  and  policy  making,  (iii)  strengthening  of \nregional  cooperation  for  urban  development,  and  (iv)  project  management  and  project \nperformance monitoring.  \n \n                                                 \n7 National  Development  and  Innovation  Committee,  Infrastructure  Development  Plans  for  the  Southern  Gobi,  2010 \ndraft \n8   \"Urban  governance\"  refers  to  local  government  land  use  planning  and  allocation  to  achieve  effective  spatial \n\ndevelopment, oversight of basic services provision, and accountability for discharging these functions. \n\n\fSupport  for  infrastructure  services  reforms  will  comprise  consulting  services  to  assist \n30. \nwith  drafting  and  tendering  operating  management  contracts,  capacity  development  for  the \nregulator, and transaction advisory services. This will build on recent steps to lay a foundation \nfor private sector participation and greater accountability for performance, including the Law on \nConcessions, which was passed in February 2010 and sets out a legal basis for PPPs, steps to \nestablish  a  PPP  unit  to  support  transactions,  and  legislation  that  is  being  drafted  on  the \nprovision and regulation of municipal services.9 \n \nInstitutional  development  to  strengthen  urban  planning  and  policy  making  will  focus  on \n31. \nthe  MRTCUD  and  the  two  aimag  centers,  with  the  soum  centers  linking  into  the  aimags  for \nplanning  support.  Assistance  will  be  provided  in  developing  urban  master  plans  in  each \nparticipating town, which will take account of town-specific aspects including the development of \nan industrial park at Saynshand and a free economic zone at Zamyn-Uud. Support at the aimag \nlevel will help aimag and soum governments manage their urban development functions more \neffectively.  More  details  on  support  for  project  management,  organizational  development  and \ncapacity building are in Appendix 5. \n \n32. \nPart  A  of  the  project  will  also  support  the  creation  of  cross-border  institutions  with \nneighboring  districts  of  the  PRC  to  improve  the  efficiency  of  border  trade  and  exploit \nopportunities  for  shared  utilization  of  assets. 10  A  joint  border  commission  will  be  created \ncomprising  local  government  and  business  representatives  from  Mongolia  and  the  PRC.  The \ncommission  will  form  separate  working  groups  to  resolve  urban  and  border  trade  processing \nissues.  The  processing  working  group  will  address  processing  issues  leading  to  greater \nefficiency  in  cross-border  transactions.  An  urban  working  group  will  review  and  resolve  urban \ninfrastructure,  operational,  environmental,  and  institutional  issues,  thereby  contributing  to \nreduced disparity in the development of towns on the Mongolian and PRC sides of the border. \n \n33. \nProject  management  and  implementation  support  under  part  A  will  ensure  that  project \ninvestments  are  designed  and  constructed  as  planned  and  that  resources  are  developed  to \nprovide  for  sustainable  management  of  the  infrastructure  so  created.  It  will  also  support  the \ndevelopment and implementation of a project benefit monitoring and evaluation system that will \nenable early identification of implementation problems and measurement of the project\u2019s impact.  \n \n34. \nPart  B  will  finance  priority  infrastructure  improvements  providing  (i)  water  source \ndevelopment,  transmission,  storage,  and  distribution,  allowing  increased  connections  to  piped \nwater  supply  and  reducing  system  leakage;  (ii)  increased  wastewater  collection  coverage  and \nenhanced  capacity  for  wastewater  treatment  and  effluent  reuse;  (iii)  improved  efficiency  and \ncoverage  of  district  heating  services;  (iv)  surfaced  central  road  networks;  (v)  development  of \ncontrolled solid-waste landfills and enhanced capacity for solid-waste collection; and (vi) in one \n\n                                                 \n9   The Law on Concessions was developed with assistance under ADB Technical Assistance to Mongolia for Support \nfor  Public\u2013Private  Partnerships  (TA  7291-MON),  and  sets out  a  framework  for  the  development  of  public\u2013private \npartnerships, including institutional  responsibilities and a range of acceptable risk-sharing arrangements between \nthe  public  and  private  sectors.  Proposed  revisions  to  the  Law  on  Utilization  of  Water  Supply  and  Sewerage \nSystems,  to  be  presented  to  Parliament  in  2010,  describe  a  mechanism  to  set  minimum  tariffs  and  quality \nstandards. It is expected that tariffs and service quality  described in Operating Management Contract (OMC)  will \nhave to meet these minimums.  \n\n10  Establishment  of  a  Zamyn-Uud\u2013Erlian  joint  border  commission  was  recommended  under  ADB  Technical \nAssistance for Development of Regional Cooperation Programs for Mongolia and the PRC. The project will support \nthe establishment and operation of subcommittees charged with urban development and cross-border trade. ADB. \n2006.

In  the  three  larger  towns,  the  project  will \naugment  the  existing  water  supply  systems.  In  the  three  small  towns,  wholly  new  piped  water \nsupply  systems  will  be  constructed.  Offsite  provision  in  all  three  small  soums  will  be  supplied \nfrom the adjacent mining companies which plan to deliver water to reservoir tanks outside the \ntowns.  Service  levels  will  include  in-house  connections  where  possible.  Apartment  blocks, \nhouses, and all nonresidential buildings will have multifaucet piped water supplies. Where this is \nnot possible or affordable, such as in the ger areas,11 the aim is to have water kiosks within 300 \nmeters  of  any  town  dweller.  In  the  case  of  rehabilitated  and  new  production,  the  project  will \nensure  effective  coordination  and  consultation  with  the  National  Water  Authority,  which \noversees  water  resource  management  issues,  and  with  any  future  groundwater  monitoring \nagencies.  \n \n36. \nIn the wastewater sector, the project will rehabilitate and expand the existing sewerage \nsystems in the three larger towns and provide new sewerage systems in the small towns. These \nsewerage  systems  will  link  unsewered  permanent  housing  areas  to  the  sewerage  system. \nWastewater  treatment  in  all  cases  will  use  waste  stabilization  ponds  which  are  simple  to \nconstruct  and  manage  and  have  only  modest  power  requirements.  In  Gurvantes  there  is  a \nproblem with run-off from the hills and an interceptor drain is included under part B to protect the \ntown from storm flash flooding. In district heating, the project will adopt a similar approach with \naugmentation and some rehabilitation of existing systems in the larger towns and new systems \nin  most  of  the  smaller  soum  centers.  The  project  will  provide  new  boilers,  pumps,  and  boiler \n\n                                                 \n11  Due to the extremely low winter temperatures in Mongolia, it is not possible to provide individual yard taps. Pipes \n\nmust be buried at least 2.8 meters underground and faucets must be in heated buildings to avoid freezing. \n\n8 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fhouses  in  some  cases,  combined  with  the  replacement  of  inefficient  pipes  and  exchangers  to \nproduce more efficient heating systems.   \n \n37. \nRoad  improvements  are  proposed  for  the  two  aimag  centers  and  in  Gurvantes, \nHanbogd,  and  Tsogttsetsii  soums  to  provide  better  form  and  structure  to  the  towns.  This  will \nassist in guiding growth, and reduce dust from driving on existing dirt roads. By defining driving \nspace, roads accidents will also be reduced. Since the cost of asphalt roads in this area would \nbe  similar  to  the  cost  of  concrete  roads,  and  as  concrete  roads  last  longer  and  require  less \nmaintenance, it is proposed to use concrete for all roads.   \n \n38. \nThe  approach  to  solid-waste  management  will  support  the  ongoing  initiatives  recently \ncommenced by most local governments. The project aims to ensure that all waste is collected \nand transported to sites where it can be recycled or disposed of to sanitary landfill sites. This will \nentail  capping  existing  dumpsites,  developing  new  landfill  sites,  and  providing  collection  and \nlandfill equipment. \n \nC. \n\nSpecial Features \n\n39. \nImplementation  arrangements  for  the  project  provide  aimag  governments  with  a \nsubstantive  role  in  implementation.  Lessons  from  three  ADB-financed  urban  infrastructure \nprojects  in  Mongolia  indicate  that  deficiencies  in  design  quality  and  delays  in  implementation \ncould be avoided if local governments were involved in design and supervision of infrastructure \ninvestments.  This  is  also  supported  by  international  experience,  which  suggests  that  the \nresponsibilities  of  local  government  should  be  aligned  with  its  accountability  for  the  quality  of \nservice  provision.  For  this  reason,  aimag  governments  will  be  the  contracting  authority  for \ndesign-and-build contracts under part B, and will benefit from technical assistance under part A. \n  \n40. \nAnother special feature of the project will be opportunities for private sector participation \nin providing and managing urban services. During project implementation, a service provider will \nbe  engaged  in  each  of  the  two  project  aimags  under  a  lease  arrangement  (operating \nmanagement  contract  [OMC])  to  operate,  maintain,  expand,  and  improve  urban  services  in \nproject aimag and soum centers for 10\u201315 years.  \n \n41. \nTwo  parallel  sets  of  project  activities  will  contribute  to  this  objective.  First,  aimag \ngovernments  will  tender  the  package  of  priority  infrastructure  improvements  under  a  design-\nand-build  modality.  Under  advance  action,  consultants  will  be  recruited  to  prepare  reference \ndesigns and contract documents for three contracts (two in Omnogovi and one in Dornogovi) for \nthe  design  and  construction  of  the  priority  infrastructure  improvements  in  aimag  and  soum \ncenters.  The  aimag  governments  will  be  supported  by  project  implementation  unit  (PIU) \nconsultants  and  PUSO  staff  who  will  be  seconded  part-time  to  the  project  to  assist  in \nsupervision.  \n \n42. \nSecond, under part A and in parallel with preparing and tendering each design-and-build \ncontract,  consultants  will  advise  government  on  structuring  long-term  OMCs  between  each \naimag government and a private sector urban services company (USC) for operation of existing \nand new assets. The OMC would cover the  aimag centers and soum centers for each aimag, \nand be regulated through the terms of the contract. A central independent regulatory body, to be \nestablished  with  assistance  under  the  project,  will  set  service  quality  standards  and  minimum \ntariffs. The USC, upon being awarded the OMC, will gain an equity stake in the PUSO and its \noperating  assets;  the  balance  of  the  PUSO\u2019s  shares  will  be  owned  by  the  aimag  government \n\n \n\n9\n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\n \n\nand PUSO managers and staff. The OMC will be awarded for a minimum of 10 years. Details of \nthe contracts will be determined on the basis of transaction advice to be provided under part A. \n \nD. \n\nProject Investment Plan \n\n43. \nThe project is estimated to cost $21.90 million equivalent, including duties and taxes of \nabout  $1.99  million.12 Table  2  summarizes  the  estimated  cost.

The  grant  will  cover,  on  a  \"gross  of \ntaxes\" basis, 90% of the cost of consulting services, including project management costs, 61% \nof  the  cost  of  civil  works,  and  90.9%  of  the  cost  of  equipment.  Taxes  and  duties  estimated  at \n$1.988 million will be financed by the Government of Mongolia. A further domestic contribution \nof  $4.9  million  equivalent  is  required,  which  will  comprise  $4.8  million  equivalent  from  the \ngovernment and $0.1 million equivalent in kind from the beneficiary aimag governments to cover \nland acquisition and office facilities. The grant recipient will be Mongolia through the MOF. The \nproposed financing plan for the project is shown in Table 3. \n \n\nTable 3: Financing Plan \n \n\nSource \nAsian Development Bank  \nGovernment of Mongolia \nAimag governments \nTotal \nSource(s): ADB staff estimates \n\nTotal Cost \n($ million) \n15.0 \n6.8 \n0.1 \n21.9 \n\nShare \n(%) \n68.6 \n30.9 \n0.5 \n100.0 \n\n                                                 \n12  Sector  investment  needs  for  the  project  towns  in  Southeast  Gobi  to  serve  the  projected  2040  population  are \nestimated at a base cost of $250 million. The medium-term investment plan to provide trunk services and tertiary \ninfrastructure to serve the projected 2025 population is estimated at a base cost of about $50 million. The medium-\nterm investment plan is used as the basis for the priority infrastructure investments that are supported by the grant. \n\n\f \n45. \nIn  accordance  with  the  prevailing  practice  for  externally  financed  projects,  the \ngovernment, through the MOF, will extend a portion ($12.2 million) of the proceeds of the grant \nto participating aimag governments through grant agreements. This approach is justified given \nthe  demonstration  value  associated  with  introducing  substantial  reforms  in  municipal  services \ndelivery, and the economy-wide benefits of supporting sustainable growth of livable towns that \ncan support mining and trade development. \n \nF. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n1. \n\nProject Management \n\nThe  MRTCUD  will  be  the  executing  agency,  supported  by  a  project  management  unit \n46. \n(PMU)  headed  by  a  project  director.  The  MRTCUD  will  be  responsible  for  overall  strategic \nguidance,  technical  supervision,  and  execution  of  the  project,  ensuring  compliance  with  grant \ncovenants. Implementation of the priority infrastructure investments component (part B) will be \ncarried  out  by  the  aimag  governments.  PIUs  will  be  established  in  each  aimag  and  will  be \nresponsible for day-to-day implementation of physical works. The MRTCUD will coordinate the \nactivities of the two PIUs at the aimag level through consultants and PMU staff, and will facilitate \nprocessing  and  approvals  of  designs,  contracts,  and  other  documents  as  required  at  the \nministry level. The project director, supported by the PMU and consultants, will (i) coordinate all \nactivities  under  the  project;  (ii)  be  responsible  for  overall  project  execution,  monitoring,  and \nsupervision; and (iii) will directly report to the chair of the project steering committee (PSC).  \n \nA state-level PSC will be set up with full powers to take decisions on matters relating to \n47. \nproject execution. The project director will be the member secretary and the committee will be \nchaired by the state secretary of the MRTCUD. Members of the committee will include the chair \nof the NDIC, director of the Budget Policy Department of the MOF, and representatives of the \nMinistry  of  Nature,  Environment  and  Tourism,  Ministry  of  Mineral  Resources  and  Energy, \nMRTCUD, and the aimag governments of Dornogovi and Omnogovi. Once the project is made \neffective,  the  PSC  will  meet  at  quarterly  intervals  to  review  project  performance  and  take \ndecisions  on  major  issues  such  as  counterpart  funding,  implementation  bottlenecks,  land \ndisputes,  special  procurement,  and  policy  reforms.  More  details  on  project  execution  and \nimplementation arrangements are in Appendix 7. \n \n48. \nThe PMU will be responsible for (i) appointing project management, detailed design, and \nconstruction supervision consultants; (ii) approving the design of the investment components in \nconsultation with the aimag governments and  project towns; (iii) assisting the PIUs to prepare \nstandard  bid  documents,  monitoring  the  tendering  process,  and  guiding  the  project  towns  in \nevaluating bids and preparing bid evaluation reports for approval by ADB; (iv) coordinating with \nADB on matters related to disbursement; (v) monitoring compliance with grant covenants; and \n(vi) maintaining project documents and submitting timely reports to ADB. \n \n49. \nThe  MRTCUD  will  be  the  implementing  agency  for  part  A.  The  participating  aimag \ngovernments  will  be  the  implementing  agencies  for  part  B.  In  each  aimag,  a  PIU  will  be \nestablished and headed by a senior technical staff member experienced in water supply, public \nhealth,  and  environmental  engineering.  The  PIUs  will  comprise  three  sections:  (i)  urban \ninfrastructure  and  services,  (ii)  community  awareness  and  participation,  and  (iii)  finance  and \nadministration.  The  responsibilities  of  the  PIUs  shall  include  (i)  carrying  out  detailed  surveys, \ninvestigations,  and  engineering  designs  of  the  subprojects;  (ii)  with  the  assistance  of \nconsultants,  preparing  bid  documents,  tendering,  evaluating  bids,  and  awarding  works;  (iii) \n\n \n\n11\n\n \n\n\fcontract  administration,  supervision  and  quality  control,  measuring  works  carried  out  by \ncontractors,  and  certifying  payments;  (iv)  conducting  public  awareness  campaigns  and \nparticipation  programs;  (v)  benefit  monitoring  and  evaluation  studies  and  environmental \nassessment;  (vi)  implementing  resettlement  plans;  and  (vii)  preparing  monthly  reports.  Aimag \ngovernments will implement the subprojects with technical assistance from the PIUs.  \n \n50. \nThe  performance  of  each  PIU  will  be  monitored  and  guided  by  aimag  working  groups \nchaired  by  the  aimag  governors.  The  working  groups  will  comprise  representatives  from  the \naimag government, soum governors, PIU, PUSO, participating community-based organizations, \nand  civil  society  representatives  to  include  prominent  citizens.  The  aimag  working  group  will \nmeet at least once every 6 months to review the progress and resolve local issues and policy \nmatters. \n \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Period \n\nThe  project  will  be  implemented  over  4.5  years  beginning  in  June  2010  and  ending  in \n\n51. \nNovember 2014. The project implementation schedule is in Appendix 8.  \n \n\n3. \n\nProcurement \n\nProcurement financed from the ADB grant will be carried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s \n52. \nProcurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  International  competitive \nbidding  (ICB)  will  be  applied  to  supply  contracts  estimated  to  cost  $500,000  or  more.  Supply \ncontracts  with  a  value  less  than  $500,000  will  follow  national  competitive  bidding  (NCB),  and \nthose  less  than  $100,000  will  follow  shopping  procedures  as  reflected  by  particular \ncircumstances  of  the  contract  packages.  ICB  will  be  used  for  civil  works  contracts  valued  at \n$1 million or more. Civil works contracts valued at less than $1 million but more than $100,000 \nwill  be  procured  using  NCB  procedures.  The  selection  and  engagement  of  contractors  will  be \nsubject  to  ADB  approval.  Any  necessary  modifications  or  clarifications  to  the  recipient\u2019s \nprocedures will be documented in the procurement plan. Any internationally tendered equipment \npackages  will  include  the  necessary  technical  support  to  ensure  proper  installation,  testing, \ncommissioning,  and  training  of  operational  staff  as  part  of  the  related  contracts.  The \nprocurement plan is in Appendix 6. \n \n\n4. \n\nConsulting Services \n\nConsultants will be selected and engaged using ADB\u2019s quality- and cost-based selection \n53. \nprocedures, consultant qualification selection, and/or individual consultant selection procedures \nThe  project  will  require  a  total  of  about  80  person-months  of  international  and  350  person-\nmonths  of  national  consulting  services  to  support  (i)  the  PMU  and  PIUs  in  project \nimplementation  and  management;  (ii)  development  of  structure  plans  for  all  project  towns; \n(iii) an  improved  institutional  and  incentive  framework  for  urban  service  delivery;  (iv)  improved \nlocal  government  capacity  for  urban  planning,  land  management  system  planning,  operations, \nand maintenance; (v) enhanced cost recovery from services through metering and tariff reform; \nand  (vi)  improved  local  government  revenues  and  financial  management  through  the \nestablishment of predictable recurrent financing and performance-based contracting and private \nsector participation.  \n  \nin  project  management  and \n54. \nprocurement,  urban  and \ninstitutional  and \norganizational  development,  capacity  building,  and  training.  The  national  consultants  will  have \n\ninternational  consultants  will  have  expertise \n\nfinancial  management, \n\nregional  planning, \n\nThe \n\n12 \n\n \n\n \n\n\fexpertise in water and wastewater engineering, resettlement, environmental management, legal \naspects,  database  development, \nfinancial  management,  construction  supervision,  and \nengineering  design.  The  consultants  will  be  selected  and  engaged  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  All  international \nconsultants  and  the  national  consultants  for  project  management  will  be  selected  and \ncontracted individually. International and national consultants for development of service lease \nagreements  and  contract  preparation,  urban  planning  reform,  and  reference  design  and \npreparation of tender documents for design-and-build contracts will be selected and contracted \nas  firms  using  ADB\u2019s  quality-  and  cost-based  selection  procedure  among  short-listed \ninternational and national consulting firms.  \n \n\n5. \n\nAdvance Contracting and Retroactive Financing \n\n55. \nTo  facilitate  timely  implementation,  the  government  has  requested  consideration  of \nadvance  contracting  and  retroactive  financing  of  eligible  expenditures  up  to  20%  of  the \nproposed grant, incurred prior to effectiveness but not earlier than 12 months before the date of \nsigning of the grant agreement. The issuance of invitations to bid or prequalify under advance \ncontracting and retroactive financing would be subject to ADB approval. All advance contracting \nand retroactive financing would be undertaken according to ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines and \nGuidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants.  The  government  acknowledges  that  any  approval  of \nadvance  contracting  and/or  retroactive  financing  will  not  constitute  a  commitment  by  ADB  to \nfinance the related project. \n \n\n6. \n\nAnticorruption Policy and Government Measures  \n\n56. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  MRTCUD  and  aimag  governments.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good \ngovernance, accountability, and transparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or \nthrough its agents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the \nproject. To support these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included \nin  the  grant  regulations  and  the  bidding  documents  for  the  project.  In  particular,  all  contracts \nfinanced  by  ADB  in  connection  with  the  project  will  include  provisions  specifying  the  right  of \nADB to audit and examine the records and accounts of the MRTCUD, the aimag governments, \nand  all  contractors,  suppliers,  consultants,  and  other  service  providers  as  they  relate  to  the \nproject.  The  MRTCUD  and  the  aimag  governments  will  undertake  the  following  actions  as \nspecified in the anticorruption strategy (Supplementary Appendix Z): (i) introduce a dual-signing \nsystem in which the civil works contractor agrees to an anticorruption clause in the contract with \nthe  employer;  (ii)  adopt  third-party  oversight  (under  the  PMU)  involving  periodic  inspection  of \ncontractors' activities related to construction, fund withdrawals, and settlements; (iii) community \noversight over the works, implemented in partnership with local nongovernment organizations; \nand (iv) extensive public disclosure of key contract documents. Tender, construction, financial, \nand summary technical information will be disclosed on the project website, in local government \noffices,  and  on  notice  boards  at  the  project  site.  At  any  time  during  implementation  and \nafterwards,  project  management  or  community  members  who  suspect  corruption  or  have \ngrievances  will  be  able  to  contact  the  PMU  through  the  PIU  or  aimag  government,  who  are \nobligated  to  convey  such  information  unchanged  and  without  delay  to  the  PMU  and  the \nexecuting  agency. All  complaints  will  be  assessed,  instances  of  suspected  corruption  will  be \ninvestigated,  and  sanctions  will  be  imposed  on  those  against  whom  corrupt  practices  are \nproved. \n \n\n \n\n13\n\n \n\n\f14 \n\n \n\n7. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n57. \nThe  grant  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook \n(2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  To  expedite  project  implementation  through  timely \nrelease of grant proceeds, the PMU will establish and administer two imprest accounts\u2014one for \ncomponent  A,  and  one  for  component  B\u2014promptly  after  grant  effectiveness  at  a  commercial \nbank acceptable to ADB.13 A sub-account will be established and administered by each of the \ntwo  PIUs. 14  Replenishment  of  the  sub-accounts  will  be  based  on  quarterly  plans  for \nmanagement and operations expenses and submission of full supporting documentation to the \nPMU. Disbursements from the imprest accounts will be supported by an appropriate withdrawal \napplication  and  related  documentation.  Such  documentation  will  demonstrate,  among  other \nthings,  that  the  goods  and/or  services  are  procured  from  ADB\u2019s  member  countries,  and  are \neligible for ADB financing. The maximum amount to be deposited into each imprest account will \nnot exceed the estimated expenditures to be financed from the respective imprest account for \nthe  next  6 months,  or  10%  (in  aggregate)  of  the  grant  amount,  whichever  is  lower.  ADB\u2019s \nstatement of expenditures procedure may be used to reimburse, liquidate, or replenish eligible \nexpenditures up to a ceiling of $100,000 per payment. Flow of funds under the grant is further \ndescribed in Appendix 11. \n \n\n8. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n58. \nThe government, through the PMU and PIUs, will maintain separate financial accounts \nfor  the  project,  and  have  such  accounts  and  related  financial  statements  audited  annually  by \nindependent  auditors  acceptable  to  ADB  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of  the  grant \nagreement and as specified in ADB\u2019s Financial Reporting and Auditing of Projects Financed by \nthe  Bank. 15  The  auditors  should  have  qualifications,  experience,  and  terms  of  reference \nacceptable to ADB. The use of the imprest accounts and statement of expenditures will also be \npart  of  the  annual  audit  and  a  separate  audit  opinion  will  be  submitted.  The  government  will \nsubmit to ADB certified copies (in English) of such audited accounts and financial statements, \nand the related reports and auditors, within 6 months after the close of each fiscal year. \n \n59. \nFor  the  purpose  of  complying  with  the  requirements  for  the  annual  audited  financial \nstatements, the proceeds of this grant may be used to finance expenditures for private financial \nstatements,  sector  auditors,  and  translations  of  auditor\u2019s  reports  into  English.  The  PMU  will \nsubmit consolidated quarterly progress reports to ADB (in English) and to the government on all \naspects  of  project  implementation.  The  reports  will  include  details  on  overall  implementation \nprogress, problems encountered during the reporting period, measures taken or proposed to be \ntaken  to  remedy  these  problems,  and  the  proposed  program  of  activities  for  the  following \nquarter.  Within  6 months  of  project completion, the  PMU  will  prepare  and  submit  to ADB,  in  a \nformat acceptable to ADB, a project completion report on the utilization and impact of the grant; \nperformance  of  the  project;  economic  and  social  benefits  generated;  and  details  about \nimplementation, costs, resettlement, and other information requested by ADB. \n \n\n9. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n60. \nThe project performance monitoring system (PPMS) will focus on targets and indicators \nidentified  in  the  design  and  monitoring  framework  including  (i)  public  satisfaction  with  the \n                                                 \n13 Bank charges will be financed from the grant resources. \n14 Dornogovi  and  Omnogovi  aimags  have  an  experience  of  using  sub-accounts  under  ADB  project  L1907-MON: \n\nIntegrated Development of Basic Urban Services in Provincial Towns.  \n\n15 ADB. 1989. Financial Reporting and Auditing of Projects Financed by the Bank. Manila. \n\n \n\n\fneighborhood environment; (ii) economic and health data; (iii) the number of households served \nby  the  improved  water  supply;  (iv)  the  number  of  public  institutions  served  by  the  improved \nwater  supply  and  sewerage;  (v)  improvements  in  solid-waste  collection  and  landfill  site \nmanagement;  (vi)  improvement  in  PUSO  (and  future  USC)  performance;  (vii)  land  acquisition, \nresettlement,  and  environmental  compliance;  and  (viii)  monitoring,  reporting,  and  National \nInspection Agency reporting.  \n \n61. \nAt the beginning of the project, the PMU and PIUs, with assistance from the consultants, \nwill develop PPMS procedures to generate data systematically on the inputs and outputs of the \nproject, as well as the agreed socioeconomic, environmental, and health indicators to be used \nto  measure  project  impacts;  and  obtain  ADB\u2019s  approval  within  the  first  3  months  after  grant \neffectiveness. The PMU will refine the PPMS framework, confirm achievable targets, determine \nmonitoring and recording arrangements, and establish systems and procedures no later than 6 \nmonths after grant effectiveness. \n \n62. \nThe  PPMS\u2014including  establishing  benchmarks,  collecting  baseline  and  progress  data, \nmonitoring  benefits,  and  evaluating  social  impact\u2014will  be  implemented  by  the  PIUs  in \ncollaboration  with  the  aimag  governments  and  PUSOs  (or  USCs).  Data  will  be  presented  in \nsimple  formats  that  allow  local  inputs  and  respond  to  reporting  formats.  The  PMU  will  be \nresponsible  for  analyzing  and  consolidating  the  resulting  data  through  its  management \ninformation system. The PPMS will be designed to permit adequate flexibility to adopt remedial \naction regarding project design, schedules, and activities. The PMU will report to ADB quarterly \non both the physical implementation and financial aspects of the project to ensure that impacts \nare monitored and reported in line with ADB requirements. \n \n\n10. \n\nProject Review \n\n63. \nThe  government  and  ADB  will  jointly  review  implementation  progress  at  least  once  a \nyear. In addition, the government and ADB will undertake a comprehensive midterm review after \n2  years  of  project  implementation.  The  midterm  review  will  include  a  detailed  assessment  of \nscope,  implementation  arrangements,  achievement  of  scheduled  targets,  progress  made  in \npolicy and tariff reform, and capacity building measures. A detailed assessment of parts A and B \nwill be undertaken. \n \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\nBenefits and Impacts \n\nA.  \n \n64. \nEconomic and financial benefits. The project will directly benefit about 100,000 people \nin six towns in Omnogovi and Dornogovi aimags, of whom approximately 30.7% live below the \npoverty  line.  The  project  components  have  strong  economic  rationale  since  they  provide \nminimum  acceptable  standards  for  basic  living  conditions  and  assist  in  removing  existing \nconstraints  on  social  development  and  economic  growth.  Similarly,  priority  infrastructure \nimprovements were designed in accordance with sound principles of priority need, consultation \nand  targeting,  and  demand  management.  The  project  supports  rehabilitation  before  new \ninvestment, and subprojects represent technically feasible options at least cost. The project will \ndevelop several direct and indirect benefits. Better access to potable water with improved water \nsupply  and  sanitation  services  (in  formal  areas)  will  provide  several  long-  and  short-term \nbenefits.  There  will  be  qualitative  improvement  in  the  lives  of  the  communities,  in  particular \nthose people living in the ger areas. Living conditions will improve at individual and communal \nlevels, including benefits from reduced water collection times and improved health. \n\n \n\n15\n\n \n\n\f \n65. \nThe water supply and wastewater economic analysis shows that economic internal rates \nof return are all well above the economic opportunity cost of capital of 12% in Mongolia, except \nin the case of Zamyn-Uud where it is marginally lower at 11.6% (Supplementary Appendix S). \nThe  wide  range  (52.1%  in  Dalanzadgad  to  11.6%  in  Zamyn-Uud)  mainly  reflects  variations  in \nper  capita  costs  arising  out  of  the  base  population  and  the  characteristics  of  the  area.  The \neconomic  internal  rates  of  return  when  subjected  to  sensitivity  tests  under  key  variables  are \nmost  sensitive  to  decrease  in  benefits  associated  with  improved  infrastructure,  and  remain \nabove the opportunity cost of capital in all towns except Zamyn-Uud. \n \n66. \nFinancial  analysis  was  undertaken  for  revenue-generating  components,  including  a \ncombined  analysis  of  water  supply  and  wastewater,  heating,  and  solid-waste  management. \nBasic  assumptions  in  computing  the  financial  internal  rate  of  return  (FIRR)  were  as  follows: \n(i) all revenues and costs are expressed in constant prices on an incremental basis; (ii) capital \nexpenditures  include  all  costs,  less  taxes  and  duties  and  price  contingencies;  (iii)  capital \nexpenditures are recorded at the time they are incurred, while interest and finance charges are \nexcluded;  and  (iv)  incremental  operating  costs  are  calculated  by  subtracting  the  existing \nsystem\u2019s  operating  costs  from  the  projected  operating  costs  for  the  whole  system  at  project \ncompletion.  The  value  of  benefits  arising  from  water  sales  was  calculated  by  multiplying  the \nvolume  of  water  sold each  year  by  the  proposed  tariffs  used  for  each  year  in  constant  prices, \nwith  an  annual  increase  of  6%  to  fall  in  line  with  inflation.  For  sewerage,  the  estimated  cash \nflows  were  based  on  the  wastewater  surcharge  on  water  bills.  Benefits  and  costs  were  kept \nconstant after financial year 2021 when all facilities would be operating at near full capacity and \npresent design demands would be fully satisfied. \n \n67. \nFinancial  analysis  assumes  that  (i)  the  mini-PUSOs  at  the  soum  centers  will  be \nabsorbed into the new USCs or fully established under the State and Local Property Law by the \ncompletion  of  the  project  by  2014  to  take  responsibility  for  owning  (or  leasing)  and  operating \nexisting  and  proposed  services  under  the  project;  and  (ii)  the  services  which  are  currently \nprovided  by  the  railways  in  Saynshand  and  Zamyn-Uud  will  be  transferred  to  the  existing \nPUSOs (or subsequent USC) in Saynshand and the fully fledged PUSO in Zamyn-Uud, or the \nnew Omnogovi USC when established.  \n \n68. \nThe  combined  FIRRs  for  all  project  components  vary  between  23.7%  in  Dalanzadgad \nand  7.4%  in  Zamyn-Uud.  Combined  FIRRs  for  water  supply  and  wastewater  vary  between \n25.2%  in  Dalanzadgad  and  4.7%  in  Saynshand  (Supplementary  Appendix  T).  The  wide \nvariation is mainly due to the nature of the scheme, distance from source, service coverage, and \noperation and maintenance costs. Piped water supply and wastewater in the smaller towns of \nTsogttsetsii,  Hanbogd,  and  Gurvantes,  and  also  in  Zamyn-Uud,  are  new  and  therefore  cost-\nintensive  with  full  benefits  to  be  derived  over  the  longer  term.  The  FIRRs  for  heating  services \nvary  between  24.9%  in  Hanbogd  and  18.9%  in  Gurvantes,  and  for  solid-waste  management \nbetween  25.6%  in  Zamyn-Uud  and  6.4%  Gurvantes.  Sensitivity  tests  indicate  that  FIRRs  are \nsensitive to decreased revenues and delays in project benefits by 1 year.  \n \nFinancial sustainability of the project investments will be achieved by applying minimum \n69. \ntariffs  as  set  out  in  the  financial  improvement  action  plans  for  each  aimag  (Supplementary \nAppendix  W).  The  proposed  OMCs  are  also  expected  to  bring  about  cost-recovery  tariffs. \nEarlier Mongolian studies on affordability for water supplies have generally found willingness to \npay  to  be  at  levels  exceeding  prevailing  prices,  particularly  in  ger  areas.  No  affordability \nproblems are seen for upper- and middle-income domestic consumers who will pay according to \nactual consumption billed at the two-tier level including a lifeline consumption charged at a lower \n\n16 \n\n \n\n \n\n\findirect \n\nlong-term \n\nis  designed \n\nfor  construction  and \n\nimpacts.  The  project \n\nSocial  and  poverty  reduction \n\nrate.  The  adoption  of  individual  apartment  metering  will  result  in  controlled  consumption  and \nreduced pressure on affordability. The average expenditure combined for water and wastewater \nat  average  household  consumption  is  estimated  to  be  below  the  affordability  level  of  6%  of \nincome. Informal area residents, using only retail water supply, pay less than 2% of income. \n \n70. \nto  have \nmultidimensional  impacts  on  poverty  reduction  by  improving  infrastructure  and  services, \ncreating  direct  employment \nincome-generating \nopportunities, and empowering poor residents in decision-making processes through improved \nurban  governance.  The  project  will  have  positive  health  benefits.  Residents  are  expected  to \nexperience a reduction in the incidence of water- and vector-borne diseases and medical costs \nand lost earning opportunities incurred as a result of these diseases.  \n \n71. \nIt  is  anticipated  that  the  sector  reforms  will  result  in  tariff  increases  for  water  supply, \nwastewater  management,  and  district  heating  to  enable  service  providers  to  recover  sufficient \ncosts to cover operational expenditures. The potential negative impact on the poor is mitigated \nby (i) financial analysis showing that increased tariffs would still remain within affordability and \nwillingness-to-pay  levels;  and  (ii)  the  poor  live  predominantly  in  ger  areas  that  do  not  benefit \nfrom  sewerage  or  district  heating,  and  where  potable  water  is  carried  from  water  kiosks, \nresulting  in  low  levels  of  consumption.  A  summary  poverty  reduction  and  social  strategy  is  in \nAppendix 12. \n \n72. \nGender  equality  impacts.  The  project  is  designed  to  produce  benefits  that  are \ndisproportionately  directed  toward  women,  who  bear  most  of  the  burden  associated  with  poor \nservice  delivery.  Women  and  their  children  spend  most  of  their  time  at  home  and  in  the \nneighborhood.  The  proposed  project  will  provide  opportunities  to  (i)  relieve  time  and  labor \nburdens  on  women  created  by  the  lack  of  access  to  basic  infrastructure  and  services; \n(ii) improve women\u2019s living conditions, health, and hygiene; (iii) create employment and income-\ngenerating  opportunities  for  women;  and  (iv)  empower  women  as  decision  makers  through \nactive involvement of women in the development process. Activities, targets, and indicators are \nset out in a gender action plan in Appendix 9. \n \nLand  acquisition  and  resettlement.  It  is  anticipated  that  land  acquisition  and \n73. \nresettlement will not be significant and can be avoided for most activities. Some houses, gers, \nand  fences  will  need  to  be  relocated  to  nearby  plots  only  in  the  proposed  roads  improvement \npriority  infrastructure  investment  in  Hanbogd.  In  accordance  with  ADB's  Safeguard  Policy \nStatement,16 a land acquisition and resettlement plan (LARP) has been prepared. To provide a \nframework for unanticipated land acquisition and resettlement as a result of changes in project \nsites  prior  to  implementation,  a  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  framework  (LARF)  has  also \nbeen prepared. The LARF sets out (i) the resettlement policy and Mongolian legal framework for \n(iii) \nland  acquisition  and \nimplementation  arrangements,  (iv)  consultation  and  participation,  (v)  eligibility  provision,  (vi) a \ngrievance  redress  mechanism,  (vii)  monitoring  and  evaluation,  and  (viii)  provision  of  the \nresettlement  budget.  The  PIUs  will  be  responsible  for  overall  resettlement  management  and \ncoordination,  internal  monitoring,  and  quarterly  reporting  to  ADB.  The  PIUs  will  also  take \nprimary responsibility for resettlement consultation, notices, implementation, and timely delivery \nof  entitlements.  Because  of  limited  experience  with  involuntary  resettlement,  training  and \ncapacity building will be conducted under part A. The PMU will review the remaining activities \nunder  part  B  before  the  award  of  the  civil  works  contracts  to  ensure  there  are  no  involuntary \n\n(ii) compensation  standards  and  entitlements, \n\nresettlement, \n\n                                                 \n16 ADB. 2009.

If  impacts  are \nidentified  and  cannot  be  avoided  in  other  project  activities,  a  LARP  will  be  prepared  in \naccordance with the provisions of the LARF and submitted to ADB. A summary of the LARPs \nand LARF are in Appendix 10. No indigenous peoples are living in the project area. \n \n74. \nEnvironmental  impacts  and  benefits.  The  project  is  classified  as  environmental \ncategory  B.  Initial  environmental  examinations  (IEEs)  were  carried  out  for  all  of  the  part  B \nactivities  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement.  In  accordance  with  ADB's \ninformation  and  disclosure  and  consultation  requirements,  these  subprojects  and  the  potential \nenvironmental impacts were presented and discussed at stakeholder meetings and focus group \ndiscussions.  Key  environmental  impacts  during  construction  are  largely  temporary  in  nature, \nand  include  dust,  gaseous  emissions,  noise,  and  some  public  inconvenience.  Operational \nimpacts  might  include  gaseous  emissions,  contamination  of  water  supply,  improper  treatment \nand disposal of sludge, or escape of leachate. The extent of these impacts will be mitigated with \nmeasures  identified  in  the  IEEs  including  careful  project  management  and  contractor \ncompliance during construction with an environmental management plan integral to the contract \ndocuments.  Key  mitigation  measures  during  operation  are  securing  an  adequate  operational \nbudget,  implementing  reforms  to  service  institutions  under  the  project,  and  developing  (under \nthe  project)  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  manuals  for  (i)  water  supply  and  wastewater \nmanagement;  (ii)  solid  waste  management;  and  (iii)  district  heating  that  incorporate  the \nconditions  stipulated  in  the  environmental  permit,  if  necessary,  and  the  proposed  mitigation \nmeasures specified in the environmental management plan (EMP).  \n \n75. \nThe  recipient's  institutional  capacity  to  manage  environmental  risks  is  limited,  with  a \nsingle  trained  full-time  environmental  staff  member  working  at  the  aimag  level  and  a  single \nuntrained environmental inspector covering all environmental matters in each soum. Aimag and \nsoum  environmental  management  and  monitoring  capacity  will  be  strengthened  with  capacity \ndevelopment and training under part A, and the PIUs will be staffed and assisted with technical \nspecialists  and  qualified  consultants  including  environmental  management  specialists.  The \nproject  will  greatly  improve  community  health  and  living  conditions,  reduce  environmental \npollution, and decrease per capita demand for energy resources by improving the efficiency of \nurban  services.  Priority  infrastructure  investments  in  solid-waste  management  will  reduce \ngroundwater  pollution,  and  improved  urban  roads  will  reduce  dust  and  noise.  EMPs,  including \nthe  Grievance  Redress  Mechanism  (GRM),  will  be  refined  during  the  detailed  design  stage \nusing a consultation process with affected persons and closely consulting project stakeholders. \nAn  environmental  safeguard  specialist  will  ensure  revised  IEEs  and  EMPs  during  detailed \nengineering design. \n \n76. \nInstitutional  benefits.  There  is  a  need  for  reform,  organizational  development,  and \ninstitutional strengthening at the national and local government levels. Reform will focus on (i) \nservice  delivery  with  the  development  of  enhanced  contractual  arrangements,  service  quality \nand  tariff  regulation,  and  partial  divestiture  of  utility  companies;  and  (ii)  urban  and  regional \nplanning.  At  the  local  government  level,  institutional  development  and  capacity  building  will \nfocus  on  planning  and  financial  management,  operation  and  maintenance  of  basic  urban \ninfrastructure  and  facilities,  maintenance  planning  for  urban  services,  community  participatory \nstructures and process, environmental monitoring, and handling of resettlement issues.  \n \nB. \n \n77. \nThe 2008 joint country portfolio performance review and a 2008 risk assessment for the \neducation and urban infrastructure sectors noted key sector risks as poor capital investment and \n\nRisks \n\n18 \n\n \n\n \n\n\fbudget  planning,  underdeveloped  institutional  frameworks  and  poor  capacity,  a  lack  of \nmonitoring  and  evaluation,  poor  procurement  integrity,  and  weak  national  contractors.  The \nproject  addresses  these  risks  by  including  capacity  building  at  national  and  local  government \nlevels  in  investment  planning,  building  the  capacity  of  local  service  institutions  with  increased \nprivate  sector  participation,  focusing  institutional  change  on  measuring  and  improving  service \ndelivery  performance,  adopting  a  design-and-build  modality  for  procurement  of  priority \ninfrastructure improvements to attract better-qualified contractors, and combining individual civil \nworks  activities  into  larger  contract  packages  to  generate  economies  of  scale  and  create \npackages which are eligible for ICB. The project will also introduce a dual-signing system and \nperiodic inspections of contractors' activities as described in para. 59.  \n \n78. \nIt  is  assumed  that  anticipated  demand  for  urban  infrastructure  services  in  the  project \ntowns  will  materialize.  The  influx  projections  underlying  the  selection  of  priority  infrastructure \nimprovements  under  part  B  assume  that  mining  developments  continue  and  that  the  major \nmining  companies  remain  committed  to  forms  of  mine  development  that  support  urban \ndevelopment in neighboring towns, and complete power supply and water source development \nprojects as planned. There is also an assumption that government policy continues to allow free \nmovement of people to the project areas. \n \n79. \nGovernment policies on PPP for the provision of municipal services are central to project \noutcomes.  There  is  an  assumption  that  the  arrangements  for  the  proposed  reform  to  service \ndelivery  institutions  in  aimag  and  soum  centers  is  supported,  in  particular  that  contracts  for \noperation of municipal services proceed and are supported by a viable independent regulatory \nmechanism.  Concrete  steps  have  been  taken  in  this  direction  and  are  backed  by  progress  on \nkey  legislation  including  the  Law  on  Concessions.  There  is  an  assumption  that  the  domestic \nprivate sector is interested in partnering with the public sector to form USCs. Based on a market \nsounding  exercise  completed  in  2009,  there  are  strong  indications  of  interest  from  domestic \nfirms. \n \n80. \nThe  project  does  not  have  any  particular  technical  risks.  Conventional  engineering \ndesigns with proven records of reliable performance are adopted for water supply, wastewater \nmanagement,  solid-waste  management,  and \nroads.  The  proposed  design-and-build \nprocurement  modality  and  packaging  of  priority  infrastructure  improvements  will  provide \ncontracts \nICB  equipment \nprocurement  will  include  technical  support  for  installing,  testing,  and  commissioning  as \nrecommended  by  the  manufacturer.  During  project  implementation,  the  PMU  will  support  the \nPIUs  to  ensure  that  equipment  and  civil  works  comply  with  design  requirements  and  quality \nstandards, and establish sustainable groundwater supply yields and groundwater monitoring. \n \n\nICB  and  attract  better-qualified  contractors. \n\nthat  qualify \n\nfor \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\nThe  government  has  given  the  following  assurances,  in  addition  to  the  standard \n\nA. \n \n81. \nassurances, which will be incorporated in the legal documents. \n \n82.  Within  24  months  of  grant  effectiveness,  the  government  will  revise  the  Law  on \nUtilization of Water Supply and Sewerage Systems by Parliament, which includes, among other \nthings, (i) establishment of an independent central regulator that will issue licenses and regulate \ntariffs  and  service  quality  levels;  and  (ii)  a  mechanism  by  which  contracted  private  operators \nmay participate in operation of water and sewerage systems by contracting with central or local \n\n \n\n19\n\n \n\n\fauthority,  as  the  case  may  be,  and  which  allows  such  contractors  to  set  tariff  or  service  fee, \nprovided either the contract is consistent with the regulatory rules or the regulator approves the \ncontract. \n \n83.  Within  24  months  of  grant  effectiveness,  each  participating  aimag  government  will \nexecute  an  operating  management  contract  with  a  USC,  specifying:  minimum  tariffs,  and  how \nthese  change  over  time;  minimum  service  quality  targets;  the  USC's  purchase  of  a  portion  of \nPUSO shares; the transfer of a portion of the PUSO's shares to PUSO management and staff; \nand the USC's investment in certain operating assets. In particular, each OMC will (i) allow that \ntariffs will be set at levels that recover at least O&M costs (including depreciation or renewals), \nand (ii) set service quality requirements so as to comply with relevant Mongolian law (including \nthe  water  quality  guidelines  in  the  Water  Law,  2004  and  Law  on  Utilization  of  Water  and \nSewerage  Services,  2002).  Such  tariffs  and  service  quality  requirements  may  differ  by  aimag \nand soum and between planned and ger areas.  \n \n84. \nPrior to the period that OMCs will be operational, each aimag government will (i) ensure \nthat  its  PUSO  will  operate  and  maintain  project  facilities  for  which  it  is  responsible;  and \n(ii) allocate and make available sufficient funds from its budget in a timely manner for each fiscal \nyear for O&M of the project facilities. \n \nThe government, with assistance from the consultants, will develop PPMS procedures to \n85. \ngenerate  data  systematically  on  the  inputs  and  outputs  of  the  project,  as  well  as  the  agreed \nsocioeconomic,  environmental,  and  health  indicators  to  be  used  to  measure  project  impacts; \nand  obtain  ADB\u2019s  approval  within  the  first  3  months  after  grant  effectiveness.  The  PMU  will \n(i) refine  the  PPMS  framework,  (ii)  confirm  achievable  targets,  (iii)  determine  monitoring  and \nrecording  arrangements,  (iv)  establish  systems  and  procedures,  and  (v)  complete  baseline \nsurveys no later than 6 months after grant effectiveness. \n \nThe  government  will  contract,  construct,  operate,  maintain,  and  monitor  the  Project \n86. \nfacilities in compliance with: (i) Mongolia's applicable laws and regulations; (ii) ADB\u2019s Safeguard \nPolicy Statement; and (iii) the updated EMPs for Omnogovi and Dornogovi.

\nThe urban sector of Mongolia is small and is characterized by the primacy of Ulaanbaatar, and \nsevere disparities in levels of urban service provision between the central formally planned (apartment) \nareas and peripheral unplanned (ger [traditional felt tent]) areas. The national urban population is about \n1.6 million, or 61% of the total population of 2.6 million, with 1.03 million (almost two-thirds of the urban \ntotal)  living  in  Ulaanbaatar.  Since  1990,  almost  all  urban  growth  has  been  absorbed  by  Ulaanbaatar, \nwhich  grew  at  2.6%  since  2004,  compared  to  less  than  1%  in  other  urban  centers.  With  sustained \neconomic growth, urban poverty has been decreasing, with the reported incidence falling from 38% in \n2001  to  27%  in  2006,  although  poverty  incidence  in  aimag  (province)  and  soum  (district)  centers \nremains at about 37%.   \n\nAn  estimated  50%  of  the  urban  population  have  access  to  household  water  supplies  through \n2. \ncentralized distribution networks in planned areas 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, whereas ger areas \nrely  largely  on  water  kiosks  served  through  the  distribution  network  or  by  tanker.  Here  water  usage \naverages 7\u201310 liters per capita per day, less than half the minimum recommended by the World Health \nOrganization. Only central areas are sewered, with ger areas relying almost exclusively on unimproved \nopen pit latrines or open field defecation. In the subsectors of solid-waste management, district heating, \nand  hot  water  supply,  a  similar  disparity  exists  between  adequate  service  in  planned  areas  and  no \nservice  in  ger  areas.  In  addition,  ineffective  design  and  lack  of  maintenance  means  that  many  of  the \npiped networks within planned areas are in urgent need of rehabilitation. \n\n3. \nThe  project  area  of  Southeast  Gobi  has  a  total  population  of  about  50,000,  but  is  set  to \nexperience  rapid  growth  in  its  urban  population  as  a  result  of  the  influx  associated  with  trade  and \nmining investments. Efforts to reach a clear policy and strategic framework for the future development \nof  the  urban  sector  in  Southeast  Gobi  are  compromised  by  institutional  fragmentation  and  a  lack  of \nconsensus  across  government  departments  and  other  stakeholders.  The  National  Development  and \nInnovation  Committee  (NDIC)  and  the  Ministry  of  Road,  Transportation,  Construction  and  Urban \nDevelopment  (MRTCUD)  are  each  carrying  out  work  on  aspects  of  the  subregional  strategy.  The \nMRTCUD  is  in  the  process  of  finalizing  a  subregional  plan  for  the  Gobi  region  covering  Omnogovi, \nDornogovi,  and  Dundgovi  aimags,  while  simultaneously  undergoing  reorganization  in  an  attempt  to \nbetter align its functions to the requirements of the sector. The MRTCUD needs to redefine its role as a \nfacilitator and regulator of urban development rather than an implementer. The NDIC has prepared a \nstrategy  for  the  development  of  infrastructure  (including  urban  infrastructure)  in  South  Gobi,  which  is \nawaiting cabinet approval. \n\nMajor  sector  issues  include  (i)  a  distorted  and  poorly  functioning  urban  planning  system  and \n4. \nland  market;  (ii)  a  lack  of  rigor,  transparency,  and  accountability  in  urban  planning  and  investment \ndecision  making;  (iii)  a deficiency  in  the  availability,  quality,  and  coverage  of  urban  infrastructure  and \nservices,  especially  in  ger  areas;  (iv)  inadequate  cost  recovery  and  poor  financial  management  of \npublic services; (v) lack of capacity of local governments to plan, and through the service organizations \nto provide and operate, urban infrastructure and facilities; (vi) inadequate focus on urban environmental \nproblems,  particularly  in  Ulaanbaatar;  and  (xiii)  inadequate  attention  to,  and  allocation  of  sufficient \nresources for, maintenance of key infrastructure assets. \n\n5. \nIn  the  project  aimags  of  Dornogovi  and  Omnogovi,  only  the  three  largest  settlements  of \nDalanzadgad,  Saynshand,  and  Zamyn-Uud  have  formal  infrastructure  services  in  the  form  of  piped \nwater supply, sewerage, and district heating networks. These are supplied only to formal housing areas \nand coverage is still limited as shown in Table A2.1. There is also a marked difference in the levels of \nservice provided to formal housing areas and ger areas in these towns. Not only do the formal housing \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 2 \n\n27 \n \n\nareas receive better services, but they also usually pay less for the services provided (Supplementary \nAppendixes B and J). \n \n\nTable A2.1: Infrastructure and Service Provision Objectives \n\n2008  \nPopulation \n\nWater Supply \n(% served with \nhousehold connections) \n\nSewerage \n(% served with \nhousehold connections) \n\nDistrict Heating \n(% served with \nhousehold connections) \n\nTown \n\nDalanzadgad \n\n15,000 \n\nSaynshand \n\n19,900 \n\nZamyn-Uud \n\n11,600 \n\n46 \n\n36 \n\n5a \n\na  ADB estimate: figure not available. \nSource: Aimag and soum public urban service organizations   \n\n36 \n\n35 \n\n3 \n\n35 \n\n35 \n\n5 \n\n6. \nApart from small district heating units that serve government offices and educational and health \nfacilities, and a water supply system in Zuunbayan, all the other smaller soum settlements in Southeast \nGobi  have  no  formal  network  infrastructure.  However,  as  all  water  is  groundwater,  all  town  dwellers \npurchase  water  supplied  by  government  from  bore  wells.  The  issue  is  that  some  urban  ger  dwellers \nhave to travel more than 1 kilometer to collect water. \n\n7. \nA  major  constraint  on  providing  sufficient  levels  of  infrastructure  service  to  gers  is  the  low \ndensities,  which  make  service  provision  expensive.  This  is  exacerbated  by  climatic  conditions  where \nthe  very  cold  winter  months  preclude  even  the  provision  of  yard  standposts  for  water  supply  to  ger \ndwellers as the pipes would freeze unless insulated and heated during winter. Indoor connections are \nonly viable for formal housing and are generally impractical in gers.  \n\n8. \nAs  there  is  no  perennial  surface  water  near  the  towns,  nearly  all  water  in  urban  areas  is \npurchased.  In  the  three  large  towns,  water  is  pumped  from  bore  wells  close  to  the  town,  treated  to \nreduce hardness, chlorinated, and pumped to reservoir tanks which serve the town with a continuous \nwater supply service. In contrast, the kiosks that serve those living in ger areas are often only open for \na few hours per day on certain days of the week.   \n\n9. \nMost of the formal apartment areas in the three larger project towns have sewerage coverage. \nThere  is  no  wastewater  system  in  the  three  smaller  project  towns  and  in  the  ger  areas  of  the  larger \ntowns. Nearly all families living in these areas use outside dry pit latrines and, due to the lack of water \nconnections, there are practically no water-sealed latrines in use. In the smaller towns, even institutions \nsuch as offices, hospitals, and school dormitories use unsanitary dry pit latrines. Not all of the formal \nhousing  is  connected  to  sewers,  and  some  large  medium-density  housing  areas  still  use  outdoor  pit \nlatrines.  All  three  of  the  large  towns  have  wastewater  treatment  plants  which  use  simple  waste \nstabilization pond technology. The effluent from all plants is disposed of to the desert, which does not \ncause  too  much  of  an  environmental  problem  as  there  is  no  habitation  around  these  ponds  and  the \ndesert can readily absorb the relatively low flows.  \n\nDistrict  heating  is  provided  in  all  six  towns\u2014in  the  three  larger  towns,  to  a  combination  of \n10. \ndomestic users, government offices, and commercial properties; in the three smaller towns the district \nheating systems only supply government institutions and one or two commercial enterprises. In some \nof the large towns, limited hot water supply is also provided along with the heating system. All heating \nsystems are based on old Russian-style systems with coal-fired boilers pumping heated water or steam \nto a high-pressure closed system. The heating is then taken to indoor radiators through separate lower-\n\n \n \n\n \n\n\f28 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n \n\npressure hot water systems heated by conduction in an exchanger from the high-pressure system. The \nboilers in most of the systems are outdated and have very low efficiency.  \n\n11. \nIn  Dornogovi,  both  Saynshand  and  Zamyn-Uud  are  connected  to  the  national  grid  through  a \n220 kilovolt-ampere  line,  which  runs  from  Choyr  to  Zamyn-Uud.  Zamyn-Uud  also  previously  imported \npower  from  the  People's  Republic  of  China  (PRC).  None  of  Omnogovi  aimag  is  connected  to  the \nnational  grid,  although  Dalanzadgad  has  a  large  power  station  operated  by  the  Ministry  of  Mineral \nResources  and  Energy,  and  most  gers,  houses,  and  all  apartments  have  power  connections.  Of  the \nsmaller towns, Gurvan Tes is connected to a 6,000 kilovolt line built by Qinhua MAK mining company, \nwhich  imports  power  from  the  PRC.  In  Tsogttsetsii  and  Hanbogd  the  power  supply  is  met  through \ndiesel  generators  and  is  only  provided  for  a  few  hours  per  day  due  to  lack  of  fuel.  Street  lighting  is \nprovided by the soums where power is available.  \n\n12. \nOnly  the  three  larger  towns  have  surfaced  intra-urban  roads,  restricted  to  the  formal  central \nareas.  The  three  smaller  towns  are  served  only  by  dirt  roads,  and  there  are  no  continuous  asphalt \nconcrete  roads  linking  any  of  the  towns  or  linking  them  to  Ulaanbaatar,  although  Zamyn-Uud  has  an \nasphalt concrete road linking it to the PRC.  \n\n13. \nThe frequency and extent of solid-waste collection varies across the towns. In the formal areas, \ncollection  is  daily  or  biweekly,  with  some  areas  also  having  communal  containers.  In  the  ger  areas, \ncollection  is  less  frequent  and  in  the  small  towns  it  may  be  carried  out  only  once  or  twice  every \n3 months. All towns have garbage disposal sites, some of which are fenced, although none are close to \nbeing considered sanitary landfills. Recycling is carried out informally, apart from Dalanzadgad where \nthere  is  a  public  utility  services  organization  (PUSO)-operated  recycling  yard.  The  seminomadic \nlifestyles of the ger dwellers mean that not much waste is generated and significant in-house recycling, \nor use of waste for fuel, takes place.  \n\n14. \nThe aimag and soum governments are responsible for service provision, including water supply, \nwastewater management, district heating, and solid-waste management (in some aimags). These are \nprovided through PUSOs which were created from various enterprises established to provide services \nunder  the  previous  communist  system.  The  PUSOs  were  meant  to  be  self-financing,  but  they  have \ndifficulty  in  setting  cost-recovery  tariffs  since  revisions  to  existing  tariff  require  approval  of  aimag \ngovernments. Mini-PUSOs or heating companies operating in the small towns in Omnogovi do so quite \nindependently of the PUSO and are regulated by an aimag coordination committee. In Dornogovi, the \ninstitutional  arrangements  for  service  delivery  have  developed  in  a  more  ad  hoc  manner.  As  both \nSaynshand and Zamyn-Uud initially developed in the 1950s as railway townships, the railway company \nprovided  all  the  municipal  services.  As  both  towns  grew,  a  parallel  local  government  was  created  to \nsupply  services  to  the nonrailway  township,  and  currently  infrastructure and  services  are  provided  by \nboth  the  railway  company  and  the  PUSOs,  although  the  railway  company  is  prepared  to  transfer  its \nassets for operation by the PUSO.  \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 2 \n\n29 \n\n \n\n \n\nd\nn\na\n\n

active in the urban sector in Mongolia, notably the World \n1. \nBank  (integrated  urban  development,  ger  [traditional  felt  tent]  area  development,  and  urban  air \nquality), Japan International Cooperation Agency (water supply, and urban planning and transport \nin  Ulaanbaatar),  and  German  development  cooperation  through  GTZ  (urban  environment  and \nenergy  efficiency).  The  World  Bank  prepared  the  Southern  Mongolia  Infrastructure  Strategy1 in \n2008\u20132009,  which  focused  on  infrastructure  and  institutional  needs  in  Omnogovi  and  brought \nstakeholders together to discuss these. It is preparing a technical assistance project that will seek \nto  stimulate  private  investment  to  support  mining  activities  and  build  local  capacity  to  prepare \ntransactions for private sector participation in infrastructure. \n \n2. \nThe Asian Development Bank (ADB) is supporting several ongoing and planned activities in \nSoutheast Gobi. About $1.3 million has gone into rehabilitating basic urban services in Saynshand \nand Dalanzadgad. More than $1 million has been invested in Omnogovi aimag (province) and $0.5 \nmillion in Dornogovi aimag in rehabilitating schools, providing textbooks and tool kits, and training \nteachers;  $1.3 million  has  been  invested  in  Dornogovi  aimag  in  rehabilitating  and  constructing \naimag  and  soum  (district)  hospitals,  capacity  building  and  training,  and  providing  medical \nequipment  and  motorbikes.  In  2009  an  advisory  technical  assistance  project  started  which  is \nsupporting HIV/AIDS Prevention in ADB Infrastructure Projects and the Mining Sector. Also in 2009, \nan ADB-financed project preparatory technical assistance project is supporting the development of \nthe Regional Logistics Development Project for trade logistics facilities at Zamyn-Uud. \n \n\nTable A3.1: Major Development Partners  \n \n\nDevelopment \nPartner \n\nADB \n\nProject Name \nLoan 1736-MON: Cadastral Survey and \nLand Registration  \n\nDuration \nJan 2000\u2013Sep \n2009 \n\nLoan 1907-MON: Integrated \nDevelopment of Basic Urban Services in \nProvincial Towns Project \n\nAug 2002\u2013Dec \n2008 \n\nAmount \n$9.90 million\n\n$20.10 million\n\nLoan 2301-MON: Urban Development \nSector Project  \n \nLoan 2301-MON: Urban Development \nSector Project (Supplementary) \nPPTA 7156-MON: Preparing Urban \nTransport Development \nGrant 9106-MON: Community-Driven \nDevelopment for Urban Poor in Ger \n(traditional felt tent) Areas (formerly \nCommunity-Led Infrastructure \nDevelopment of Urban Poor in Informal \n\nDec 2006\u2013Jun \n2013 \n\n$28.20 million\n\n$7.03 million\n\n$1.20 million\n\n$1.50 million\n\nOct 2008\u2013Nov \n2009 \nMar 2007\u2013Jun \n2011 \n\n                                                 \n1 World Bank, 2009, Southern Mongolia Infrastructure Strategy Report, Washington DC \n\n \n\nSectors and \nThemes \nAgriculture \nand Natural \nResources \nWater Supply \nand Other \nMunicipal \nInfrastructure \nand Services \nWater Supply \nand Other \nMunicipal \nInfrastructure \nand Services \nTransport \nand ICT \nWater Supply \nand Other \nMunicipal \nInfrastructure \nand Services \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nProject Name \nSettlement Areas [Ger Areas]) Improving \nthe Living Environment of the Poor in \nGer Areas of Mongolia's Cities (JFPR)  \nSecond Ulaanbaatar Services \nImprovement Project  \n\nEnergy Sector Project  \n\n(JICA -

Mining  companies  have  developed  bore  fields  to  exploit  deep  aquifers  for \nindustrial use near Tsogttsetsii and Hanbogd, and plan to provide bulk water to the local population. \nBased  on  studies  undertaken  by  two  private  mining  companies  (Ivanhoe  Mines  and  Energy \nResources,  the  deep  aquifers  they  will  tap  for  industrial  needs  are  not  linked  with  the  shallow \naquifers accessed by existing and proposed wells to provide potable supplies.  \n \n4. \nDespite  indications  that  there  is  no  linkage  between  shallow  and  deep  aquifers  in  this \nregion, the importance of these resources for sustainable development underscores the need for a \nviable  groundwater  monitoring  system.  The  World  Bank  is  initiating  work  on  new  institutional \narrangements  for  groundwater  monitoring,  which  by  the  end  of  2010  will  prepare  a  groundwater \nmanagement  plan  for  the  South  Gobi  hydrological  region  (which  includes  Omnogovi  and \nDornogovi),  develop  a  framework  for  integrated  groundwater  management,  advise  on  requisite \npolicy  and  legislative  needs  and  the  establishment  of  a  new  groundwater  management  center  in \nthe region in 2011. In 2010 Oyu Tolgoi (the company that is developing and mining the Oyu Tolgoi \ncopper deposit) will begin a substantial groundwater monitoring program in the area near Hanbogd \nand  has  committed  to  an  approach  that  involves  local  stakeholders  and  ensures  transparency. \nEnergy Resources is expected to implement a similar groundwater monitoring program in the area \nnear Tavan Tolgoi and around points of groundwater abstraction commencing in 2010.  \n \n\n \n\n\f38  \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n \n\nInstitutional Arrangements and Processes for Development Coordination  \n\nA groundwater monitoring system is needed to ensure that information about the impact of \n5. \nabstraction  by  the  mining  industry  can  be  used  in  environmental  planning,  future  mining \ndevelopment, pasture management, and urban development. The initiatives of the World Bank and \nmining companies will together address this need across Southeast Gobi. Review missions for the \nproposed  project  will  address  the  issue  on  a  regular  basis.  The  project  management  unit  will \nensure  coordination  with  the  National  Water  Committee  and  any  future  water  resources \nmanagement agency.  \n \nAs part of due diligence, the project will establish sustainable groundwater yields of water \n6. \nsupply  wells,  confirm  absence  of  conflicts  between  existing  water  users,  conduct  testing  and \nanalysis  of  drinking  water  quality,  and  obtain  water  extraction  and  development  permits,  as \nnecessary. \n \nC. \n \n7. \nKey  development  partners  engaged  in  the  urban  sector  (including  the  Japan  International \nCooperation  Agency,  German  development  cooperation  through  GTZ,  and  the  World  Bank)  are \nmembers  of  the  Urban  Development  Working  Group  (UDWG)  whose  mandate  is  to  facilitate \ndialogue  and  coordinate  assistance.  The  UDWG  is  chaired  by  the  minister  of  roads,  transport, \nconstruction and urban development, and cochaired by the governments of Germany and Japan. It \nmeets on a quarterly basis. Development partners also coordinate bilaterally and multilaterally on \nspecific  subsector  issues,  such  as  urban  planning  for  Ulaanbaatar,  or  water  sector  reform  and \nregulation. \n \nD. \n \n8. \nThrough  bilateral  coordination  and  the  UDWG  mechanism,  development  partners  have \nachieved  a  consensus  on  the  need  for  improved  urban  planning  and  reform  of  key  municipal \nservices.  Furthermore,  there  is  effective  coordination  regarding  subsector  priorities  and  activities. \nAn  example  of  this  has  been  seen  in  the  closely  coordinated  and  interlinked  activities  of  ADB, \nWorld  Bank,  the  European  Bank  for  Reconstruction  and  Development,  and  the  Millennium \nChallenge  Corporation  in  addressing  air  pollution  in  Ulaanbaatar.  In  Omnogovi,  the  World  Bank \nand ADB have had frequent dialogue concerning regional planning, groundwater management and \nmonitoring, infrastructure needs, and policy reform. \n \n\nAchievements

implementation.  At  present \nthe  capacity  of  both  aimag  (province)  and  soum  (district)  governments  to  respond  to  citizen\u2019s \ndemands, and initiate, plan, deliver, and manage urban infrastructure development and improved \nservice  delivery,  is  limited.  Local  governments  have  limited  financial  and  technical  resources,  an \nabsence of systems, few staff, and inadequate capacity to effectively carry out these tasks. At the \nsame  time,  although  the  executing  agency\u2014the  Ministry  of  Roads,  Transport,  Construction  and \nUrban  Development\u2014has  experience  in  the  execution  of  urban  development  projects,  it  has \npreviously performed as both executing and implementing agency, delivering completed projects to \nlocal  governments  and  providing  little  in  the  way  of  technical  assistance,  capacity  building,  or \ntraining  to  assist  local  governments  to  develop  their  own  urban  planning  and  management \ncapability.  The  project  needs  to support  a  shift  in  responsibility  for  urban  planning, management, \nand  delivery  of  local  infrastructure  from  the  national  government  to  local  governments,  with  the \nministry moving to a regulatory, facilitating, and supporting role in the sector.  \n\n2. \nThe quality, coverage, and reliability of service delivery at the aimag level are constrained \nby existing service delivery arrangements. The public urban service organizations (PUSOs) are just \ncoping  in  maintaining  existing  levels  of  service  and  are  not  in  a  position  to  expand  service \ncoverage  to  meet  expected  demand  for  services  and  infrastructure.  They  are  guided  by \nmanagement contracts that lack specificity on service quality and coverage, dispute resolution, and \nremuneration;  struggle  to  recover  operating  and  maintenance  costs;  and  lack  access  to  training \nand  managerial  expertise.  The  most  fundamental  constraint  is  low  tariffs;  PUSOs\u2019  requests  for \nincreases to enable routine operating and maintenance costs to be recovered are often rejected by \nthe aimag Citizens' Representatives Khural1 due to the political unpopularity of such adjustments. \nThe  project  presents  an  opportunity  to  introduce  fundamental  changes  to  the  institutional \nframework  for  municipal  service  provision  and  its  regulation  through  (i)  divesting  all  or  part  of \nPUSOs  so  as  to  decouple  service  providers  from  local  government  administration  and  attract \nprivate  capital  and  expertise;  (ii)  introducing  an  operating  management  contract  that  provides \nperformance-based  incentives  for  the  service  provider;  and  (iii)  establishing  a  regulatory \nmechanism  at  a  central  level,  which  links  tariffs  with  the  prices  of  key  inputs  and  avoids  political \ninvolvement in tariff setting.  \n\nTo  support  this  institutional  development  and  reform,  it  is  proposed  under  part  A  of  the \n3. \nproject to use the project itself as a vehicle to bring about this change. The proposed project thus \nadopts  a  \u201cdrivers  of  change\u201d-type  of  approach, whereby  the  reform  and  institutional  development \nactions  required  to  underpin  the  execution  of  the  sector  road  map,  and  thus  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB)-supported project, form an integral part of the project itself. It is intended \nthat  execution  of  the  project  will  help  to  drive  change  in  policy  areas  that  are  closely  related  to \nproject  execution\u2014the  role  of  national  and  local  government  in  urban  development,  urban \nplanning, service delivery, and local government finance\u2014in addition to project management and \nsupervision. \n\n4. \nPart A of the project will provide financial and technical assistance, consulting services, and \ntraining  to  both  national  and  local  governments  to  (i)  ensure  effective  project  execution  and \nimplementation  (including  project  benefit  evaluation  and  monitoring);  (ii)  build  local  government \ncapacity  in  urban  governance,  planning,  development  and  management,  and  sustainable  service \ndelivery; (iii) build urban planning capacity at national and local levels and support preparation of \nstructure plans for the project towns; (iv) provide transaction advice for the tendering of operating \nmanagement contracts for urban service delivery, and in establishing a regulator; and (v) ensuring \n\n                                                 \n1 Parliamentary body at the aimag level. \n\n \n\n\f42  \n\nAppendix 5 \n\n \n\ncompliance  with  project  safeguards.

Development (MRTCUD) \nwill  be  the  executing  agency,  supported  by  a  project  management  unit  (PMU)  headed  by  a \nproject  director.  The  MRTCUD  will  be  responsible  for  overall  strategic  guidance,  technical \nsupervision, and execution of the project and ensuring compliance with grant covenants. A state \nproject  steering  committee  (PSC)  will  be  set  up  with  full  powers  to  take  decisions  on  matters \nrelating  to  project  execution.  The  project  director  will  be  the  member  secretary  and  the \ncommittee will be chaired by the state secretary of the MRTCUD. Members of the committee will \ninclude the chair of the National Development and Innovation Committee (NDIC), director of the \nMinistry  of  Finance  (MOF),  representatives  of  the  ministries  of  environment  and  mineral \nresources  and  energy  and  the  aimag  (province)  governments  of  Dornogovi  and  Omnogovi. \nOnce the project is made effective, the PSC will meet at least once every 3 months to review \nproject  performance  and  take  decisions  on  major  issues,  such  as  counterpart  funding, \nimplementation bottlenecks, land disputes, special procurement, and policy reforms. \n \nThe PMU will be responsible for (i) appointing project management consultants, detailed \n2. \ndesign,  and  construction  supervision  consultants;  (ii)  approving  the  design  of  the  investment \ncomponents  in  consultation  with  the  aimag  government  and  project  towns;  (iii)  assisting  the \nproject implementation units (PIU), which will be formed at aimag level to implement the project, \nin preparing standard bid documents, monitoring the tendering process, and guiding the project \ntowns  in  bid  evaluation  and  preparation  of  bid  evaluation  reports  for  approval  by  the  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB);  (iv)  coordinating  with  ADB  on  matters  related  to  disbursement;  (v) \nmonitoring  compliance  with  grant  covenants;  (vi)  supervising  project  benefit  monitoring  and \nevaluation;  and  (vii)  maintaining  project  documentation  and  submitting  timely  reports  to  ADB. \nThe PMU will be supported by consultants. \n \n3. \nThe  project  director,  supported  by  the  PMU  and  its  consultants,  will  coordinate  all \nactivities  under  the  project;  be  responsible  for  overall  project  execution,  monitoring,  and \nsupervision; and will directly report to the chair of the PSC.  \n \n4. \nImplementation  of  part  A  of  the  project  will  be  managed  by  the  MRTCUD  through  the \nPMU  and  with  assistance  from  the  PMU  management  support  consultants.  Implementation  of \nthe urban environmental improvement component (part B) will be carried out by the participating \naimag governments with assistance from the MRTCUD. At aimag level, the MRTCUD will set up \nPIUs in each aimag center, headed by a senior technical officer as the PIU project director. The \ndirector will be responsible for the day-to-day implementation of the respective physical works \npackages. The MRTCUD will coordinate the activities of the two PIUs at the aimag level through \nmanagement consultants and PMU staff, and will facilitate processing and approvals of designs, \ncontracts,  and  other  documents  as  required  at  ministry  level.  The  PMU  and  PIUs  will  be \nproperly  staffed  and  assisted  by  consultants  with  expertise  in  engineering,  finance  and \naccounting, social and gender development, institutional development, community development, \nprocurement,  resettlement,  and  urban  planning.  This  will  include  environmental  management \nconsultants and environmental safeguard specialist who will ensure revised and expanded IEEs \nand  EMPs  are  prepared  during  detailed  engineering  design.  The  refined  EMPs  and  the  GRM \nwill be made available to the affected persons.  \n \n5. \nIn each aimag, the PIU will comprise three sections: (i) urban infrastructure and services, \n(ii)  community  awareness  and  participation,  and  (iii)  finance  and  administration.  With  the \nassistance of consultants, the responsibilities of the PIUs shall include (i) carrying out detailed \nsurveys, investigations, and reference designs of the subprojects; (ii) preparing bid documents, \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 7 \n\n47 \n\n \n\ntendering,  evaluating  bids,  and  awarding  works;  (iii)  contract  administration,  supervision  and \nquality control, measurement of works carried out by the contractors, and certifying payments; \n(iv) conducting public awareness campaigns and participation programs; (v) benefit monitoring \nand  evaluation  studies  and  environmental  assessment;  (vi) implementing  resettlement  plans; \nand  (vii)  preparing  monthly  reports  to  the  PMU  and  aimag  governments.  Aimag  governments \nwill  implement  the  subprojects  with  technical  assistance  from  the  both  the  PIU  and  the  public \nurban service organization.  \n \nThe progress of the project and performance of each PIU will be monitored and guided \n6. \nby  aimag  working  groups  chaired  by  the  aimag  governors.  The  working  groups  will  comprise \nrepresentatives  from  the  aimag  government,  soum  (district)  governors,  PIUs,  public  urban \nservice  organizations \n(or  urban  services  companies),  participating  community-based \norganizations,  and  civil  society  representatives  to  include  some  prominent  citizens.  Once  the \nproject  is  made  effective,  the  aimag  working  group  will  meet  at  least  once  every  3  months  to \nreview project progress and resolve local issues and policy matters. \n \n7.

of a connector road in Hanbogd is a priority infrastructure improvement of \n1. \nthe  infrastructure  development  component  (part  B  of  the  project).  Land  acquisition  and \nresettlement  impacts  of  this  priority  infrastructure  improvement  are  minimized  by  acquiring  four \nresidential plots and relocating affected households on-site, thus avoid affecting the socioeconomic \nsetting and social organization of the affected persons. Three households on two plots, including a \nlessee,  will  be  displaced;  two  households  on  the  other  two  plots  will  lose  land  partially,  and  two \nlessees on the other two plots will be relocated. No productive assets and income sources are lost. \nThe estimated number of persons affected by this priority infrastructure improvement is 26 from a \ntotal of seven households. The land acquisition and resettlement plan (LARP) is in Supplementary \nAppendix N. \n \n2. \nOf  a  total  of  seven  households,  two  households  will  each  lose  their  entire  750  square \nmeters  (m2)  of  owned  land  and  will  be  allocated  land  on-site  (close  to  existing  plots).  One \nhousehold will lose one-third of owned land and will be compensated equivalent to the size of the \nland to be acquired. One household that occupies a 1,232 m2 plot (out of which 166 m2 or 13% is \nnontitled)  will  lose  the  nontitled  land.  In  terms  of  structures,  five  gers  (traditional  felt  tents),  six \nsheds, and 237 meters of wooden fence will be permanently displaced. Owners and lessees who \nneed to relocate their gers and other light structures shall be provided with financial assistance. All \naffected households will be compensated in accordance with the entitlement matrix in the LARP.  \n \nCompensation to the affected persons will be paid in full prior to the possession of the land \n3. \nand the award of civil works contracts. A resettlement budget of $53,086 including contingencies is \nprovided. An implementation schedule indicates milestones within an approximate time frame.  \n \nInformation  dissemination  and  consultation  has  already  begun  and  will  continue.  All \n4. \naffected household heads participated in a consultation meeting on 7 June 2009 held in Hanbogd. \nThis was followed by individual meetings and interviews with affected persons. The contents of the \nLARP were discussed. The LARP has been translated into Mongolian and made available at the \nsoum (district) governor\u2019s office in Hanbogd for public reference. A grievance redress mechanism \nhas been stipulated in the LARP and was explained to the affected persons during the consultation \nmeetings. \n \nMonitoring and evaluation will include internal and external monitoring. Internal monitoring \n5. \nwill be carried out by the Omnogovi project implementation unit (PIU). The PIU will submit internal \nmonitoring  reports  to  the  project  management  unit  (PMU)  and  executing  agency  at  monthly \nintervals  during  the  LARP  implementation.  An  independent  consultant  will  be  appointed  to  (i) \nimplementation;  (ii)  submit  reports \nconduct  external  monitoring  during  and  after  LARP \nsemiannually  to  the  PIU,  PMU,  and  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB);  (iii)  evaluate  the \nresettlement  effectiveness  and  impact  and  sustainability  of  resettlement  entitlements;  and \n(iv) identify  strategic  lessons  for  future  policy  formulation  and  planning.  Internal  and  external \nmonitoring  reports  and  evaluations  will  be  sent  to  ADB  headquarters  through  ADB\u2019s  Mongolia \nResident  Mission  for  review.  The  project  midterm  review  will  include  a  separate  section  on  the \nprogress of LARP implementation. Upon completion of land acquisition and resettlement activities \nin  the  project  components,  the  project  aimags  (provinces)  will  prepare  resettlement  completion \nreports  for  submission  to  ADB.  The  PMU  will  be  responsible  for  engaging  an  evaluation  and \nmonitoring agency, which will investigate, monitor, and evaluate LARP implementation in all project \ncomponents over a 3-year period and report to the PMU and ADB. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 10 \n\n53 \n\n \n\nLand Acquisition and Resettlement Framework \n\nNo indigenous people were found living in the subproject area and therefore there are no \n\n \n6. \n With  the  exception  of  the  two  households  headed  by  women  identified  as  vulnerable \nhouseholds  requiring  special  assistance,  no  adverse  impact  on  either  men  or  on  women  is \nexpected from the construction of the road.  \n \n7. \naffected persons identified in this category. \n \nB. \n \n8. \nWhile no additional land acquisition and resettlement impacts are expected in other priority \ninfrastructure  improvements  under  the  project,  the  rapid  population  influx  and  economic \ndevelopment in the project area raises the possibility that unforeseen impacts may occur. For this \nreason, a land acquisition and resettlement framework (LARF), prepared in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard Policy Statement,1 has been prepared and is in Supplementary Appendix M.  \n \nThe  LARF\u2019s  provisions  and  stipulations  are  applicable  to  all  project  components.  It \n9. \nestablishes a policy framework for compensation eligibility and entitlements for all types of affected \npersons. It outlines the necessary steps to prepare satisfactory LARPs for project components that \nhave  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  impacts  and  stipulates  arrangements  for  consultation  and \npublic participation, grievance redress, and monitoring and evaluation. \n \n10. \nLand acquisition and resettlement by the government for local-scale projects in urban areas \nis  based  on  negotiation  and  contracts  with  affected  persons  according  to  the  Civil  Code  of \nMongolia.  The  ADB  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  recognizes  negotiated  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement  as  long  as  there  are  willing  and  free  buyers  and  sellers,  and  eligibility  and \nentitlements  are  clearly  defined  and  agreed.  All  affected  persons  are  eligible  for  entitlements,  as \nstipulated in the LARF for the project, including owners, possessors, users, legalizable occupants, \nnontitled occupants and lessees. The eviction of unlicensed affected persons is a violation of the \nADB  Safeguard  Policy  Statement.  All  affected  persons  who  are  unlicensed  occupants  of  land  in \nger areas designated for land allocation are treated as legalizable under the LARF for the project. \n \nThe  LARF  stipulates  a  detailed  procedure  for  the  preparation  of  a  LARP,  including \n11. \nidentification  of \nfield  verification,  notification  of  a  cut-off  date,  census  and \nsocioeconomic  survey,  contract  negotiations  with  affected  persons,  as  well  as  LARP  disclosure \nand  consultation  meetings  with  affected  persons.  The  aimag  and  soum  governments  are \nresponsible  for  the  preparation  of  LARPs,  through  their  respective  PIUs.  All  LARPs  will  meet \nrequirements  under  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  and  closely  follow  the  provisions  of  the \nLARF. \n \nto  guide  and  monitor  project \nformed  within  each  aimag \n12. \nimplementation  will  be  responsible  for  implementing  the  LARPs.  The  local  PIUs  will  assist  the \nworking  groups  and  ensure  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  safeguard  compliance  and \nsubmission of satisfactory LARPs to PMU and ADB. The working group members will ensure close \ncoordination between all project stakeholders. The PIUs will conduct a series of training workshops \nto  inform  members  of  the  working  groups  about  the  requirements  under  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy \nStatement and LARF and LARP implementation. \n \n\nAimag  working  groups \n\nthe  scope, \n\n                                                 \n1   ADB. 2009.

Manila. \n\n \n\n\f54 \n\nAppendix 10 \n\nInformation for, consultation with, and participation of affected persons are ensured through \n13. \nindividual  and  public  meetings  throughout  the  LARP  preparation  and  implementation  process, \nduring which their rights and entitlements, including grievance procedures, are fully explained and \ndiscussed. Drafts of the LARPs in Mongolian are disclosed, discussed, and amended in the public \nconsultation  meetings  and  final  LARPs  are  published  on  the  ADB  website  and  on  display  at  the \nrelevant bag2 offices. \n \n14. \nA grievance action form has been designed to cover the various aspects addressed by the \nLARPs  and  used  in  the  grievance  redressal  process  to  log  and  follow-up  any  grievance.  A  four-\nstep grievance mechanism with a 5-week time line for each case will be set up, for which the aimag \nworking groups, aimag and soum governors, and the Land Acquisition Directorate are responsible. \nGrievances not resolved by grievance redressal mechanisms are referred to the courts. \n \n \n\n                                                 \n2 Smallest administrative unit in Mongolia.  \n\n \n\n\f \nA  portion  of  the  proceeds  of  the  grant  will  be  extended  by  the  recipient,  through  the  Ministry  of \nFinance (MOF), to participating aimag (province) governments.  \n \n\nFLOW OF FUNDS \n\nAppendix 11 \n\n55 \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n  \n  \n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n \n  \n\n \n  \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n  \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n  \n\n \n  \n\nAsian Development Bank \n\n \n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\n \nt\n\nn\na\nr\nG\n\n \nt\n\nn\na\nr\ng\n-\nb\nu\nS\n\n \nt\n\nn\ne\nm\ne\ne\nr\ng\nA\n\n  \n\nMongolia (Ministry of Finance) \n\n \n  \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n  \n  \n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n \n  \n\n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n  \n\n  \n\nAimag Government \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 12 \n\n56  \n \n\n \n\nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY \n\nCountry and Project Title: Mongolia: Southeast Gobi Urban and Border Town Development Project \n\n \nLending/Financing \nModality: \n\n \n\n \n\nProject/Grant \n\nDepartment/ \nDivision: \n\nEast Asia Department \nMongolia Resident Mission \n\n \n\n \n\nI. \n\nPOVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\nA. Link to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \n \n\nThe  project  has  been  identified  and  prepared  based  on  (i)  the  National  Development  Strategy  and  ADB-supported  urban \nsector  road  map;  (ii)  the  World  Bank-supported  report  on  the  Southern  Mongolia  Infrastructure  Strategy  (and  particularly \nsections on Housing and Urban Infrastructure); (iii) the government\u2019s development plans for the infrastructure development  \nin  Southern  Gobi  prepared  by  the  NDIC;  (iv)  planned  logistics  infrastructure  development  at  Zamyn-Uud  and  other  border \ncrossings;  (v)  the  Land  Management  Plan  for  the  \u201cGalbyn  Gobi\u201d  micro-regional  development  concept  prepared  under  the \nguidance of the MRTCUD; (vi) urban development master plans and investment plans prepared for aimag centers and key \nsoum  centers  in  the  region;  and  (vii)  meetings  and  workshops  with  government  officials,  the  private  sector,  and  other \nstakeholders including town residents. \n\nAn urban development plan for the subregion has been prepared  which sets out the development goals and objectives for \nurban development in 2010-2015, and identifies investments to achieve these objectives. Based on the plan, an institutional \nreform  and  development  framework  has  been  developed  which  will  support  effective  planning,  financing,  and  operation  of \nurban  infrastructure  and  services.  This  sets  out  specific  reforms,  associated  capacity  development,  and  a  timetable  for \nimplementation.  Emphasis  is  placed  on  (i)  improving  local  governance  and  urban  planning  and  management  capacity,  (ii) \nimproving  the  institutional  and  contractual  arrangements  for  service  provision,  (iii)  enhancing  urban  planning  systems  and \ncapacities at national and local levels, and (iv) minimizing recurrent expenditures and establishing clear accountability for the \nperformance of contractors and service providers. \n\nThe  project  is  designed  to  have  multidimensional  impacts  on  poverty  reduction  by  improving  infrastructure  and  services, \nreducing time spent in water collection, creating direct employment for construction and indirect long-term income-generating \nopportunities,  and  empowering  poor  residents  in  decision-making  processes  through  improved  urban  governance.  The \nproject  will  have  positive  health  benefits.  Residents  are  expected  to  experience  a  reduction  in  the  incidence  of  water-  and \nvector-borne diseases and medical costs, and lost earning opportunities incurred as a result of these diseases.  \n\nIt is anticipated that the sector reforms  will result in tariff increases for  water supply,  wastewater management, and  district \nheating in order to enable the service providers to recover sufficient costs to cover operational expenditures. The impact of \ntariff increases on the poor is not serious because (i) financial analysis shows that increased tariffs would still remain within \naffordability  and  willingness-to-pay  levels;  and  (ii)  the  poor  live  predominantly  in  ger  areas,  which  do  not  benefit  from \nsewerage or district heating, and where potable water is carried from water kiosks, resulting in low levels of consumption.  \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                  Targeting Classification:  General Intervention \n \nKey  issues. The project is primarily designed to improve the urban infrastructure and services of selected aimag and soum \ncenters in Dornogovi and Omnogovi aimags. The key focus of the project will be to provide urban infrastructure and services \nto  the  project  aimag  and  soum  centers  to  improve  the  quality,  reliability,  and  coverage  of  urban  services  to  existing \ncommunities and to serve incoming populations.  \n \nAll the soum centers are projected to experience a significant influx of people, mostly driven by the growth of mining jobs and \nassociated  infrastructure  in  the  area,  and  the  resulting  growth  in  cross-border  trade  with  the  PRC.  Consequently,  existing \nurban infrastructure and services, which are already deficient, will become still less adequate. Population expansion will lead \nto growth in service industries provided that barriers to access to job opportunities are removed. \n\nThe  project  thus  aims  to  improve  urban  infrastructure  and  service  provision  so  as  to  contribute  toward  the  overall \nenhancement of urban service quality and coverage in the soum centers. The project will contribute to improved access to \nservices and better quality of life for the project beneficiaries, thereby alleviating those aspects of human poverty.  \n\nDesign  features.  It  is  anticipated  that  the  sector  reforms  will  result  in  tariff  increases  for  water  supply,  wastewater \nmanagement,  and  district  heating  to  enable  the  service  providers  to  recover  sufficient  costs  to  cover  operational \nexpenditures.  The  poor  live  predominantly  in  ger  areas,  which  do  not  have  sewerage  or  district  heating  services.  Potable \nwater is carried from water kiosks, the number of which will be increased under part B of the project, thus reducing the time \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 12 \n\n57 \n\n \n\n \n\ntaken to collect water.     \n \nA  community  consultation  and  participation  framework  has  been  prepared  for  the  project  to  ensure  the  participation  of  the \ncommunity, including women, in project planning and implementation. Contacts and dialogue with the beneficiaries built up \nduring the public consultation phase can be used as a basis to form infrastructure project implementation committees (one \nper soum center). The composition of these committees will include equal numbers of working-age women and men and will \ninclude representatives from low-income households. \n \n\nII. \n\nSOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\nA.  Findings of Social Analysis  \n \n\nKey  issues. The key  poverty aspect  which  is applicable in the urban context focuses on deprivation through limited  or no \naccess to basic urban services. The infrastructure improvements made under this project include new or improved access to \ndrinking  water,  district  heating,  sewerage,  electricity,  solid-waste  management,  and  secondary  paved  roads.  Each \nbeneficiary community includes low-income households.   \n \nResidents  living  in  gers  and  some  houses  who  will  not  be  connected  to  piped  services  will  nonetheless  benefit  from  the \nimprovements  to  public  health  brought  about  by  water  supply  improvements  through  kiosks,  and  improved  sanitation  in \nschools,  clinics,  and  other  institutions. The  entire  population  will  benefit  from  a  cleaner  and  less  dusty  urban  environment. \nImproved  services  will  also  help  stimulate  business  growth  and  income  generation,  provided  that  the  safeguards  of \nvocational  training  are  also  implemented.  Forty  two  project  components  have  been  prepared  in  the  aimag  centers  of \nDalanzadgad and Saynshand, and in the soum centers of Zamyn-Uud, Gurvantes, Tsogttsetsii, and Hanbogd. \n\nB.  Consultation and Participation  \n\n \nConsultation and participation during project implementation and monitoring will involve the following:  \n \n\n No  \n\n Empowerment \n\n  Collaborative decision making     \n\n  Consultation      \n Yes    \n\n  Information sharing       \nWas a C&P plan prepared? \n \n Project  stakeholders  include  the  central  and  local  governments;  institutions  such  as  schools,  kindergartens,  and  clinics; \nbeneficiary populations living in apartments, houses, and gers; and small-business proprietors and future mining employees \nwho will live in the project areas. During project preparation, discussions were undertaken with project beneficiaries. Particular \nattention was paid to ensuring participation of residents of the various dwelling types (some living in formal areas with access \nto  a  range  of  network  services,  others  living  in  informal  ger  areas  with  limited  access  to  services)  and  which  have \nsocioeconomically vulnerable households headed by women and other low-income households, so as to receive their views \nand opinions on the project.  \n \nThe  primary  aim  of  all  these  discussions  was  to  (i)  inform  the  communities  and  population  about  the  proposed  project \nintervention;  (ii)  get  a  better  understanding  of  the  prevailing  conditions  and  coping  mechanisms  related  to  access  to  urban \nservices, in particular in relation to the poor and to women; and (iii) get wider public input and suggestions from stakeholders \non the project intervention, particularly the priority and levels of affordability with regard to the infrastructure offered.  \n \nThese discussions and consultations confirmed the need for the project. There was a positive response from all stakeholders \namong  all  socioeconomic  groups  toward  the  project.  The  key  benefits  of  the  project  as  voiced  by  the  stakeholders  are  (i) \nbetter service provision will reduce drudgery involved in collecting water for drinking, cooking, and hygiene, particularly in the \ncase of  women and children; (ii) improved  sewage disposal  and  waste  management will support increased cleanliness and \nhygiene,  and  reduced  waterborne  diseases  in  institutions  and  in  the  home;  (iii)  other  services  will  provide  improved  urban \namenity  and  living  conditions,  and  a  healthier  and  less  dusty  public  environment;  and  (iv)  improved  heating  will  lead  to \nincreased productivity within dwellings.  \n \nFuture  public  consultations  and  disclosure  will  be  held  during  detailed  engineering  design,  construction,  and  operational \nstages. The PMU, PIUs, and soum project inspectors  will be responsible for addressing any concerns and issues raised by \nproject  beneficiary  communities,  regular  meetings  with  infrastructure  project  implementation  committees,  and  instituting  the \nnecessary changes or additions in project management and environmental or social mitigation measures. These shall follow \nthe general guidelines of (i) all stakeholders should be invited and encouraged to participate in the consultation  workshops; \n(ii) suggestions from the general public may  be sought  through the mass  media,  when necessary; and  (iii) the PIUs,  aimag \nand soum project and environmental inspectors, contractor, and/or operator should meet with and be responsive to the public \non matters concerning the progress of the projects, adverse social or environmental impacts, effective mitigation measures, \nand quality of monitoring and supervision. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 12 \n\n58  \n \n\n \nInformation  disclosed  to  date  includes  project  objectives  and  components;  proposed  subprojects  and  subcomponents; \nproposed  implementation  arrangements;  and  environmental,  social,  land  acquisition,  and  resettlement  requirements  of  the \nproject following the disclosure and safeguard policies of the Government of Mongolia and the ADB. \n \nFuture  public  consultation  will  include  involvement  in  monitoring  impacts  and  mitigation  measures  during  construction  and \noperation, evaluating environmental and economic benefits and social impacts, and interviewing the public after the project is \ncompleted.  The  soum  and  aimag  governments  will  establish  and  operate  a  social  and  environmental  complaints  and \ngrievance  procedure  to  facilitate  the  identification  and  resolution  of  project  implementation  issues  that  concern  the \nbeneficiaries or any affected person. \n \n\nC.   Gender and Development \n\nKey  issues. To understand gender-specific roles, gender status, needs, and problems within the selected aimag and soum \ncenters,  a  process  of  female  and  male  focus  group  consultations  was  undertaken.  These  comprised  women  and  men \nbelonging  to  various  socioeconomic  categories  in  the  subproject  areas.  The  topics  discussed  included  the  likely  gender \nimpacts of the project in terms of women\u2019s and men\u2019s traditional roles. Future employment expectations were also discussed. \nThese discussions aimed to capture  women\u2019s and men\u2019s collective perceptions about social, economic, and cultural norms; \ntheir ability to access and afford the future new services; and prospects for future employment in their areas.  \n \nThe discussions with the women indicated that the improvements to urban services, particularly water supply and heating, will \nhave significant positive  impacts in relieving the burden of housework,  while at the  same time freeing  up time to  engage  in \nother of income-generating activities. This requires certain measures to be put in place, including (i) water supply and other \nmunicipal services which would give women more time for productive endeavors, empowerment activities, and leisure; and (ii) \nimprovements to heating which would improve their mobility and productivity within their dwellings in winter.   \n \nThe men were interested in increased income-generation potential that improved water supply and other services will bring. In \nparticular, opportunities for horticulture and a variety of workshop activities will be increased. \n \nThe  forecast  rapid  population  influx,  initially  of  unaccompanied  men,  brought  about  by  the  new  economic  development, \n(although  not  directly  resulting  from  this  project),  has  potential  negative  impacts,  particularly  on  women.  Project  measures \nhave  been  formulated  to  ensure  that  absorptive  capacity  of  project  benefits  by  women  will  not  decrease.  For  example, \nvocational training and HIV/AIDS awareness and prevention will be provided under part A to (i) protect adolescent women and \nlow-income or unskilled women from being forced into prostitution and cross-border trafficking; and (ii) ensure that women will \nbe  able  to  take  advantage  of  the  new  amenities  and  business  opportunities  directly  and  indirectly  afforded  by  project \nimprovements.  \n \nKey  actions.  Measures are included in the design to promote gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment\u2014access to and \nuse  of  relevant  services,  resources,  assets,  or  opportunities;  participation  in  decision-making  process;  and  access  to \nemployment and training activities. A gender action plan has been prepared with key actions to ensure and measure women's \nparticipation  in  decision  making  and  consultation.  Implementation  of  the  gender  action  plan,  which  is  included  as  an \nassurance, will be the responsibility of the PMU which will work with the PIUs to measure indicators and achieve targets. The \nMongolia Resident Mission gender specialist will support PMU and PIU staff during implementation. \n \n\n Gender action plan       \n\n  Other actions or measures      \n\n  No action or measure  \n\nIII. \n\nSOCIAL SAFEGUARD ISSUES AND OTHER SOCIAL RISKS \n\nIssue \n\nSignificant/Limited/ \nNo Impact \n\nInvoluntary Resettlement \n\nLimited impact \n\n \n\nStrategy to Address \nIssue \n\nMinor resettlement is \nrequired for a road access \nsubproject in Hanbogd.

There \nare no indigenous people \nin the project area. \n\nThe project is expected to \ngenerate employment \nopportunities for local \ncommunities during the \nconstruction and \noperational phases, \nprovided that adequate \nskills, vocational training, \nand transparent \nrecruitment practices are \nimplemented for both \nwomen and men. \n \nIndications are that the \nsubprojects can be \nafforded by the beneficiary \ncommunities through \nservice tariffs which are \nwithin the limits of \naffordability and \nwillingness to pay of the \nbeneficiary communities.  \nThe PPTA study identified \nseveral significant risks in \nthe project area, although \nnot caused by the project. \nThe executing agency will \ninclude clauses in the civil \nworks contracts to ensure \nthe contractors (i) provide \ntransparent recruitment \nprocedures, especially for \nlocal residents; (ii) provide \nvocational training where \nappropriate; \n(iii) disseminate \ninformation at work sites \non risks of sexually \ntransmitted diseases and \nHIV/AIDS as part of health \nand safety measures for \nthose employed during \nconstruction and operation \nof the mines and project; \nand (iv) follow and \nimplement legally \nmandated provisions on \nlabor (including equal pay \nfor equal work), health, \nsafety, sanitation, and \nworking conditions. \n\nAppendix 12 \n\n59 \n\n   Indigenous Peoples Plan \n   Indigenous Peoples \n\nFramework \n\n   Environment and Social \nManagement System \n\n   No Action \n\n   Plan \n   Other Action  \n   No Action \n\n   Action \n   No Action \n\n   Plan \n  Other Action \n   No Action \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 12 \n\n60  \n \n\nIV.
