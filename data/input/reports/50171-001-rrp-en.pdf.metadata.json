This  is  an  eligible  transaction  under  the  Faster  Approach  to  Small  Nonsovereign \nTransactions (FAST) framework.1 The transaction involves a loan of up to $20,000,000 or \nPakistan rupee equivalent to Khushhali Bank Limited (KBL) for Expanding Access to Credit for \nAgriculture and Micro, Small, and Medium-Sized Enterprise Borrowers in Pakistan. \n \nII.  THE FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARY \n \nA.  Investment Identification and Description \n \n2.  The long-run gross domestic product (GDP) growth of Pakistan is characterized by \nrepeated cycles of rapid growth followed by slowdowns. After expanding at an average growth \nrate of 6.2% from fiscal year (FY) 2003 to FY2008,2 GDP growth slowed between FY2008 and \nFY2013 to an average rate of 3.0% on the back of a challenging investment climate, high inflation, \nand an unresolved energy crisis.3 Since FY2014, Pakistan\u2019s economy has gained positive \nmomentum with FY2016 GDP growth at 4.7%, which was the highest growth since FY2007 but \nbelow the target of 5.5% set by the government.4 This was mainly due to weak performance of \nthe agriculture sector, which showed negative growth of 0.19% against the target of 3.90% due \nto low commodity prices and poor weather conditions.  \n \n3.  The acceleration in economic growth can be attributed to (i) the government\u2019s successful \n3-year, $6.4 billion macroeconomic and structural reform program, supported by the International \nMonetary Fund (IMF), that ended in September 2016; (ii) lower oil prices that have lowered \nimports by 9.1%, and high remittances of $9.7 billion in the first 6 months of 2016; and (iii) an \nimproved security situation.  \n \n4.  Finance sector. The finance sector in Pakistan is underdeveloped. Total bank assets \nincreased by 16.1% during FY2016 to PRs15,374 billion.5 Growth was largely driven by increased \nholdings of government securities, which equaled a high 53.6% of total assets by the end of \nFY2016. The loan\u2013deposit ratio for the Pakistan banking industry stood at 55.2% in FY2016 \ncompared to 77.6% in India and 72% in Bangladesh. Customer deposits have expanded with a \ngrowth rate of 10.5% from PRs9,980 billion in FY2015 to PRs11,024 billion in FY2016. Net \nadvances grew at 13.8% from PRs4,552 billion in FY2015 to PRs5,180 billion in FY2016, but still \nremain at 39.3% of total banking industry assets in Pakistan. Sector dynamics strongly favor large \nbanks as larger branch networks and scale coincide with better spreads and cost\u2013income ratios, \nresulting in higher profitability and valuation than mid-sized banks. There are 41 banks operating \nin the country. The top five banks (Habib Bank, National Bank of Pakistan, United Bank, MCB \nBank, and Allied Bank) earned 61.8% of sector pretax profits in FY2016 while holding only 51.1% \nof sector assets. Capital adequacy is sound, even after implementation of Basel III at the \nbeginning of 2014.6 Capital adequacy of the sector was 16.1% at the end of FY2016 under the \nBasel III standard as compared to 17.2% at the end of FY2015.  \n                                                \n1  Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2015.

Quarterly Compendium: Statistics of the Banking System. http://www.sbp.org.pk/ \necodata/fsi/qc/2016/Jun.pdf  \n6  According to the Basel III framework, the minimum total capital was increased to 8.0% in 2014 and will gradually \nincrease to 10.5% by 2019. \n \n ", "2    \n \n5.  Fifty  entities  operate  in  Pakistan\u2019s  microfinance  subsector.  Microfinance  providers \nprimarily include microfinance banks (MFBs), microfinance institutions (MFIs), rural support \nprograms (RSPs), and other microfinance practitioners running microfinance operations as part \nof their multidimensional service offering (including telecommunications companies). MFBs are \nentities that provide credit and take deposits from the general public and are regulated by the \nState Bank of Pakistan (SBP), the country\u2019s central bank. MFIs are institutions that provide micro \ncredit to their clients but do not raise deposits from the general public. RSPs provide micro credit \nas part of their multidimensional rural support programs.7  \n \n6.  Since 2005, the microfinance subsector has grown six times in terms of borrowers and 15 \ntimes in terms of outstanding credit. The gross loan portfolio of the microfinance subsector stood \nat PRs104 billion ($1 billion) at the end of the first quarter of 2016. The Pakistan Microfinance \nNetwork estimates the potential microfinance market at 20.5 million individuals, with a current \npenetration rate of 19.5%. The microfinance subsector offers group loans as well as individual \nand micro, small, and medium-sized enterprise (MSME) loans. Group loans used to comprise the \nmajority of the gross loan portfolio, but have been declining since 2012 and now account for \n38.8% of the gross loan portfolio (as of the first quarter of 2016), as an increasing number of \nborrowers graduate to individual and MSME lending.  \n \n7.  Access to finance is very limited. Access to finance is highly constrained in Pakistan. \nAccording to World Bank estimates, only 10.3% of Pakistani adults and only 3% of women over \nthe age of 15 have a bank account with a formal financial institution. This is well below both the \nSouth Asian average of 33.0% and the average for all lower middle-income countries of 41.4%.8 \nAn estimated 86% of the population in Pakistan has no access to formal financial services; 56% \nof adults in Pakistan use neither formal nor informal products and, while 36% of adults save, only \n4% save with a formal financial institution. Similarly, while one-third of adults borrow money, only \n3% borrow from a formal financial institution. The use of mobile money is growing rapidly but is \nstill limited to 11% of males and 3% of females. Two-thirds of the country lives in rural areas, \nwhere often the only sources of capital are informal lenders, who charge exorbitant interest rates \nand capitalize on the vulnerability of the poor.9  \n \n8.  Access to finance is particularly constrained for MSMEs and individual micro borrowers, \nincluding farmers. Banks in Pakistan tend to be selective in risk taking, with a clear preference for \nproviding working capital and trade finance to large corporations with lower risk profiles and an \naversion to lending to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Domestic credit to the private \nsector as a percentage of GDP stood at 15.4% in 2015 (footnote 8). Nonperforming loans (NPLs) \nare high but adequately provisioned. At the end of FY2016, the gross NPL ratio was 11.1%, an \nimprovement from the peak of 16.7% at the end of September 2011. SMEs had the highest NPL \nratio (26.5%), followed by agriculture (15.5%). The poor quality of SME loans can be attributed, \nin part, to inadequate credit risk appraisal and the effect of chronic power shortages on business \nprofitability. Access to finance for micro enterprises is even more limited and remains largely \nunmet by the formal finance sector. The limited supply of credit to micro enterprises is a major \nconcern to policy makers in Pakistan and the SBP has been encouraging microfinance banks to \nprovide  larger  loans  to  micro  enterprises.  It recently  increased  the maximum  loan  size  of \nmicrofinance banks from PRs150,000 to PRs500,000. \n                                                \n7  Pakistan Microfinance Network. 2016. MicroWatch: A Quarterly Update on Microfinance Outreach in Pakistan. \nhttp://www.microfinanceconnect.info/assets/articles/67c46230ff56934efe801fd0e1c4b25f.pdf (accessed 11 October \n2016). \n8  World Bank (WB). 2016. World Bank Open Data. Washington, DC. \n9  SBP. 2015. National Financial Inclusion Strategy Pakistan. Islamabad. \n ", "  3 \n9.  Micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises and agriculture. Financing needs of \nMSMEs are largely unmet. There are 3.2 million SMEs in Pakistan but only approximately 188,000 \nloans outstanding on banks\u2019 books. MSMEs receive only 7% of total bank credit to the private \nsector but contribute 40% to GDP.10 MSMEs are estimated to account for 98% of all enterprises \nin Pakistan and are estimated to employ more than 80% of the nonagricultural labor force. SME \nlending increased in the early 2000s but has dropped significantly since 2008. The SME Bank, \nwhich was set up by the government to boost the development of SME finance, has almost \nstopped lending because of poor asset quality and accumulated losses. Loans for working capital \nare the most common type of SME lending. Value-chain finance and cash-flow lending are very \nrarely used.11  \n \n10.  Agriculture is an important sector for Pakistan\u2019s economy with 120 million people directly \ndepending on agriculture to survive; however, 85% of farmers are financially excluded. Agriculture \nemploys nearly 45% of the labor force, and major crops such as wheat, paddy, maize, sugar cane, \nand cotton provide employment to around 13.5 million households. Despite the sector contributing \nalmost 19% of GDP, credit to the agriculture sector remains small and amounted to only 5.2% of \ntotal bank loans by FY2016. The SBP estimates total demand for agriculture credit to be PRs790.0 \nbillion, against the current portfolio of PRs296.6 billion. MFB loans account for only 7% of the total \nvalue of loans outstanding but for approximately one-third of borrowers.  \n \n11.  Investment rationale. Given the very low credit extended to the private sector, specifically \nto MSMEs and agri-borrowers, and the importance of these two segments to economic growth \nand poverty alleviation in Pakistan, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) met with a number of \nbanks and nonbank finance companies in 2016 to identify candidates for funding. KBL is one of \nthe few MFBs with a long and successful track record in agriculture and MSME lending. As the \nlargest microfinance institution in Pakistan, KBL has nationwide presence through 129 branches \nand is ideally positioned to utilize ADB\u2019s funding for the improvement of access to finance for the \nunderserved. It currently serves over 500,000 low-income borrowers. KBL\u2019s strategy since its \nfounding in 2000 also includes empowerment of women by providing women with increased \nopportunities to access financing. About 25% of the current portfolio consists of female borrowers. \nKBL actively markets the case studies of some of its female clients, branded as \u201dthe Wonder \nWomen of Khushhalibank\u201d, as role models for other women and to enhance financial awareness.  \n \nB.  Business Overview and Strategy \n \n12.  Founded in 2000, KBL was a part of the government\u2019s poverty reduction strategy and its \nmicrofinance sector development program, development of which was facilitated by ADB. As \nnoted, KBL is the largest MFB in Pakistan with a nationwide presence in all districts of the country \nand a network of 129 branches, which is expected to grow to 139 branches by the end of 2016. \nKBL has the largest client base among MFBs in Pakistan and offers diverse products for both its \nloan and deposit clients. At the end of 2015, KBL served over 0.5 million active borrowers and \nmanaged a gross loan portfolio of over PRs17 billion ($162.4 million). KBL has over 1 million \nactive savers with total deposits exceeding PRs15 billion. The bank also offers remittance \nservices and micro insurance products.  \n13.  KBL\u2019s 5-year strategy will enable it to transform its portfolio from primarily micro group-\nbased loans to a good mix of group, individual, and MSME loans. The number of KBL\u2019s total active \nborrowers is projected to reach over 600,000 with a gross loan portfolio of PRs45 billion by \n                                                \n10 WB. 2016. What Will It Take for Pakistan to Achieve Financial Inclusion? Washington, DC. \n11 SBP. 2015. National Financial Inclusion Strategy Pakistan. Islamabad. \n ", "4    \n \nFY2020, reflecting a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 20.0% from FY2015 to FY2020. \nSince acquisition by its current shareholders in 2012, KBL has embarked on a growth-driven \nstrategy which entails product mix diversification. While KBL continued to cater to rural and urban \nmarkets through its core group lending product, the bank also scaled-up its secured portfolio to \ndiversify its loan book and has established its presence in the MSME segment. The product \nportfolio of KBL includes the following: \n(i)  Group loans. Group loans constituted 67% of the total loan portfolio as of the end \nof CY2015. These loans are uncollateralized group loans with group sizes of 5\u201320 \nmembers and loan sizes of PRs10,000\u2013PRs50,000 ($100\u2013$950). The average \ntenor of these loans is 12 months and repayment options are offered in both equal \nmonthly installments and seasonal bullets. Currently, over 90% of the group loan \nportfolio  comprises  agriculture  and  livestock  bullet  loans.  Based  on  its  past \nexperience, KBL intends to limit this portfolio to the agriculture sector only and exit \nfrom group lending based on equal monthly installments as farmers\u2019 cash flows \nare linked to a crop cycle. Based on KBL\u2019s 5-year business plan, its group loan \nportfolio is expected to grow at a low CAGR of 1.6% from FY2015 to FY2020 \nbecause of management\u2019s concerted efforts to diversify KBL\u2019s loan book. This will \ngradually reduce the proportion of these loans from 67% of total loans in FY2015 \nto 30% of total loans by FY2020. KBL maintains very high client retention rates for \nthis product and expects to maintain an 80% retention rate. \n(ii)  Individual loans. Individual loans represent 30% of the bank\u2019s total portfolio and \nare targeted toward slightly larger businesses in urban markets with loan sizes of \nPRs25,000\u2013PRs150,000 ($240\u2013$1,430). These loans are primarily collateralized \nand backed by securities such as gold, KBL term deposit certificates, and national \nsavings certificates. Payments are predominantly structured as equal monthly \ninstallments. KBL expects to maintain an individual loan share of 30% in the overall \nportfolio for  2017-2021.  For  that  purpose,  it  is  offering  a  diversified  suite  of \nindividual loan products to its customers including value chain financing, Shandar \nBachat Scheme12 (savings-based), and livestock and revolving credit facilities. \nDiversification  will  also  be  instrumental  for  growth  and  to  achieve  portfolio \nconcentration limits. The individual portfolio is projected to grow by over 100% in \nfrom 2017-2021, from PRs5 billion to over PRs12 billion. While these loans are \nsecured by collateral, they are only offered for cash-flow-generating businesses \nand, hence, KBL provides specialized cash-flow-based lending training to its staff \noffering this product. The individual loans portfolio is expected to grow at a CAGR \nof approximately 19.1% from 2015 to 2020. \n(iii)  Micro, small, and medium-sized enterprise loans. With the introduction of an \nSBP regulation allowing for the extension of loans to the MSME segment of up to \nPRs500,000 ($4,760), KBL has developed a new product which caters to the \nneeds of larger micro enterprises which have worked with KBL in the past but have \nfinancial  needs  that  have  outgrown  the  bank\u2019s  standard  products.  The \ndevelopment of the MSME product is supported by the Small Business Banking \nNetwork  of  the  United  States.  At  the  end  of  FY2015,  the  MSME  portfolio \nconstituted 3% of the total loan portfolio. As a strategy, the MSME portfolio build-\nup will be gradual and done in phases to maintain asset quality. The MSME product \nroll-out will enhance the sector diversification of KBL\u2019s loan portfolio from mainly \nagriculture to a wide range of sectors serviced by micro enterprises. KBL plans to \nextend MSME outreach from a base of 350 borrowers in FY2015 to over 70,000 in \n                                                \n12 This scheme was designed to attract and retain small savings from KBL\u2019s target market segment, especially women, \nin current account category with an additional offer of a loan facility for the enterprises and livestock sectors. ", "  5 \nFY2020. Average loan sizes are projected to grow from PRs250,000 in 2015 to \nPRs412,000 in 2020 with average loan tenor of 18 months. MSME loans are \nexpected to comprise 37% of the total outstanding loan portfolio by the end of 2020, \nrepresenting a CAGR of 62.8% from FY2015 to FY2020. \n(iv)  Housing and Islamic finance. These new products for KBL, expected to be rolled \nout by the end of 2016, will feature housing and Islamic finance in accordance with \nthe regulations, with loans up to PRs500,000 with terms initially from 60 months to \n120  months.  The  International  Finance  Corporation  is  providing  technical \nassistance to the bank to develop the housing finance product. Based on KBL\u2019s \nprojections, the combined housing and Islamic finance loan portfolio is expected \nto grow at a CAGR of 75.7% from FY2016 to FY2020. \n \n14.  From 2017-2021, KBL\u2019s strategy is focused on two key areas: (i) diversifying and de-\nrisking its loan portfolio, and (ii) enhancing profitability and return on assets. While the majority of \nits business will continue to comprise group and individual loans, the MSME product roll-out will \nenable the bank to develop a new niche for itself, improve its receivables, diversify product \nconcentration, and bring greater profitability to the branches. New initiatives such as housing and \nIslamic finance will further diversify KBL\u2019s asset portfolio. In terms of de-risking its portfolio, KBL \nis offering crop insurance and livestock insurance by rolling out third-party insurance products. It \nis also implementing a new core banking system for improved business processes, enhanced \nefficiency and productivity, and better risk management.  \n \n15.  The second key focus area of KBL\u2019s strategy of enhancing profitability relies on its ability \nto improve its cost of funds. Deposits will be the primary source of funding to support loan portfolio \ngrowth and KBL is placing strong emphasis on deposit mobilization by (i) offering a suite of current \naccounts, savings accounts, and term deposit offerings; (ii) increased investments in service \ndelivery options by new branch openings (10 new branches every year from 2017-2021); and (iii) \ndigital banking initiatives. Being the largest MFB in Pakistan with an existing branch network of \n129 and over 2,000 branch staff, KBL has the advantage of maintaining over 1 million customer \nrelationships. KBL aims to focus on cross-selling, leveraging its large branch network and \ngradually building its current account and savings account (CASA) book. KBL\u2019s loan\u2013deposit ratio \nis expected to improve from 125% in FY2015 to 84% by FY2020. In addition, KBL will pursue a \nmix of local and international institutional funding sources and is currently in discussions with the \nOverseas Private Investment Corporation OPIC and the International Finance Corporation, in \naddition to ADB.  \n \nC.  Ownership, Management, and Governance \n \n16.  Ownership. The shareholding of KBL is largely vested with a consortium led by one of \nthe largest commercial banks in Pakistan, United Bank Limited, which holds a 29.7% shareholding. \nThe other shareholders include Rural Impulse Fund II (24.5%), responsAbility Global Microfinance \nFund (19.9%), ShoreCap II Limited (14.3%), ASN-Novib Microkredietfonds (9.9%), and Bank Al \nHabib Limited (1.8%).  \n \n17.  Management. KBL\u2019s 10-member executive management team is responsible for the day-\nto-day management of the bank. The management team has many years of experience in the \nbanking industry. Ghalib Nishtar, the president and chief executive officer, founded the bank in \n2000 and was part of the process initiated by the Government of Pakistan to reform the finance \nsector under the microfinance sector development program.  \n ", "6    \n \n18.  Governance structure. KBL\u2019s board of directors comprises seven members and includes \nleading commercial bankers, fund managers, and microfinance experts from across the globe. \nThis autonomous, private sector board provides stewardship and guidance to the management. \nKBL is regulated by the SBP. \n \n19.  Risk management. KBL is governed by a board-approved risk management policy that \noversees all aspects of risk including credit, operational, market, liquidity, interest rate, and \ncompliance. The board\u2019s Risk Management Committee consists of four members and is updated \nregularly on the risks and the mitigating actions taken to manage them.  \n \n20.  Integrity due diligence has been conducted in accordance with ADB's Integrity Due \nDiligence Guidelines for Nonsovereign Operations.13 ADB\u2019s review of the ownership structure \ndoes not give ADB cause to believe that such entity has been established, or is being used for \ncross-border tax evasion, money laundering, or terrorism financing in the jurisdictions involved in \nthe investment.  \n \nD.  Financial Performance \n \n21.  Credit rating. KBL has the highest credit rating in the microfinance subsector in Pakistan. \nIn April 2015, JCR-VIS Credit Rating Company upgraded the entity rating of KBL from A/A-1 \n(Single A/A-One) to A+/A-1 (Single A Plus/A-One).  \n \n22.  Capital  adequacy.  KBL  has  maintained  healthy  capitalization  with  a  total  capital \nadequacy ratio (CAR) of 20.24% at the end of 2015, well above SBP\u2019s minimum regulatory floor \nof 15.00%. It dropped from 24.6% in 2014 largely because of the rapid increase in loans. Total \ncapital grew 20.3% in 2015, but this was slower than growth in assets.  \n \n23.  Earnings and profitability. KBL ended FY2015 with a pretax profit of PRs1.18 billion \n($11.3 million), up 25.5% from Rs942 million ($9.1 million) reported as of FY2014. After-tax profit \nstood at PRs824 million, an increase of 17.2% from the FY2014 profit of PRs703 million. The \nincrease in profit resulted from continued growth in the balance sheet and improved non-interest \nincome. The return on equity improved from 18.5% to 20.2% and return on average assets \nmarginally decreased from 3.7% in FY2014 to 3.4% in FY2015.  \n \n24.  Portfolio and asset quality. In FY2015, KBL\u2019s total assets increased to PRs26.7 billion, \nan increase of 60% over FY2014. The gross loan portfolio grew by 43% to PRs17.5 billion in \nFY2015 from PRs12.2 billion in FY2014. Asset quality deteriorated in FY2015 and PAR3014 \nincreased from 1.0% in FY2014 to 2.1% in FY2015. This was primarily because of stress in the \nagriculture sector in Pakistan due to weather and delayed payments of major crops, especially \ncotton, rice, and potatoes.  \n \n25.  Funding and liquidity. KBL has maintained a comfortable liquidity and solvency position. \nIn FY2015, KBL\u2019s liquid assets to deposits and money market funding was 11.7%, down from \n15.8% in FY2014. KBL has set a higher floor for a liquid assets reserve of 15% of total assets in \nits 5-year plan. The higher liquid assets target is expected to achieve a higher statutory liquidity \nratio of 25% to provide a cushion over and above the regulatory floor of 10%. In terms of funding, \nKBL\u2019s retail deposits increased by 79% from PRs8.7 billion in FY2014 to PRs15.6 billion in \nFY2015.  \n                                                \n13 ADB. 2015.

THE ADB ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  The Assistance \n \n26.  The ADB transaction will support financial inclusion for agri-borrowers and MSMEs.15 The \nproposed ADB assistance consists of a senior unsecured loan to KBL of up to $20 million with a \n4-year tenor. Up to 25% of ADB\u2019s funding will be targeted to female borrowers. ADB is planning \nto complement the proposed loan with technical assistance of up to $400,000, which will be \nprocessed separately. The technical assistance will support the establishment of an MSME \ntraining academy as well as investments in KBL\u2019s risk management systems.  \n \nB.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n27.  Monitoring and reporting. ADB\u2019s Private Sector Operations Department will carry out \nproject monitoring. KBL will provide ADB with financial reports at predetermined regular intervals \nand  as  requested.  These  will  include  (i)  annual  audited  financial  statements,  (ii)  quarterly \nunaudited financial statements, (iii) quarterly compliance certificates for loan covenants, (iv) \nsemiannual reporting on MSME and agriculture loan portfolios, and (v) semiannual reporting on \nselected development indicators agreed by ADB and the borrower.  \n \n28.  Evaluation. Monitoring reports will be prepared and submitted to ADB regularly, and at \nleast  annually.  The  first  report  will  be  submitted  no  later  than  12  months  after  the  first \ndisbursement. \n \nC.  Value Added by ADB Assistance \n \n29.  Broadening access to finance. ADB\u2019s funding will help KBL to continue to grow and \nreach unbanked, lower-income customer segments in Pakistan. It will support the roll-out of its \nMSME product\u2014a market currently being serviced by the highly expensive informal finance \nsector\u2014as well as support further growth of its agriculture portfolio. ADB\u2019s funding is expected to \nresult in enhanced financial inclusion in a country that lags significantly behind other South Asian \ncountries in this area.  \n \n30.  Supporting microfinance bank development. As discussed, the banking industry in \nPakistan has been risk averse to a number of segments, resulting in these segments being served \nthrough nonbank finance companies at present. To support lending to a broader spectrum of \nunderserved  segments,  the  SBP  recently  raised  the  regulatory  cap  on  micro  credit  from \nPRs150,000 to PRs500,000. This was done to encourage MFBs to serve the MSME segment as \nwell as offer new products (i.e., rural housing finance). By providing funding for onlending to the \nMSME segment, ADB has a unique opportunity to support microfinance banking reforms and \npromote credit to MSMEs.  \n \n31.  Provision of longer tenor debt. KBL has historically focused on group loans, with \nrelatively short loan tenors of less than 12 months. As KBL management focuses on diversifying \nits loan portfolio and growing its MSME loan portfolio, which have relatively longer tenors, the \n                                                \n15 The State Bank of Pakistan definition for MSMEs will be used. Micro enterprises are those entities that have up to \n10 employees. A small enterprise has up to 50 employees and up to PRs150 million in annual turnover. A medium-\nsized enterprise has 51\u2013250 employees if it is operating in manufacturing and service and 51\u2013100 employees if it is \noperating in trading. Annual turnover for a medium-sized enterprise is PRs150 million\u2013PRs800 million.  ", "8    \n \nbank needs additional sources of longer tenor financing. Therefore, ADB\u2019s loan will provide scarce \nmedium-term funds needed by KBL to diversify its product portfolio. \n \n32.  Increase lending to women. KBL is committed to increasing lending to women. Access \nto finance for women in Pakistan is still severely limited with only 3% of adult women over the age \n15 having a bank account. Up to 25% of ADB\u2019s loan will be dedicated to lending to women.  In \naddition, ADB has agreed a Gender Action Plan (GAP) with KBL that will include staff training to \nenhance lending to women. \n \nD.  Risks \n \n33.  Execution risk. KBL\u2019s business plan foresees strong growth rates in loan assets, deposits \nand capital accumulation. Expansion into new asset classes that require new risk management \ncapacities and increases KBL\u2019s exposure to higher risk agriculture sector lending. KBL\u2019s solid \ntrack record in managing its growth provides comfort in its ability to grow without loosening risk \nstandards.  \n \n34.  High staff attrition. In line with industry average, KBL experienced a high staff attrition \nrate of 18% in 2015 primarily among loan officers. This exposes KBL to significant operating risk, \nespecially in terms due diligence and loan collections. To address this, KBL has implemented \nnew training, and more market-based and performance-driven compensation. Staff attrition will \nbe included as part of the quarterly management reports submitted to ADB to monitor this risk. \n \n35.  Evolving institutional capacities need improvement. As MSME lending started in 2015, \nKBL\u2019s operational capabilities for this business segment are still to be tested. Loan approvals are \nbased on cash flow analysis performed by its loan officers, who are mostly fresh graduates with \nlimited experience. Although loan officers are compensated based on loan accounts and asset \nquality, loan origination and approval are managed by the same team under the stipulated credit \npolicy guidelines of the Risk Management. \n \n36.  Asset quality and profitability. KBL has experienced strong growth in recent years and \nis expanding into new asset classes. Historically, the MSME and housing finance segments in \nPakistan have seen high NPL rates and most of the commercial banks avoid these segments. \nThis notwithstanding, KBL has maintained good asset quality with sound underwriting standards.  \n \n37.  Currency risk. The loan is expected to be denominated in US dollars while the bank\u2019s \nclients, which are mostly not naturally hedged, borrow in local currency. KBL is planning to hedge \nthe currency risk through foreign exchange swaps.  \n \n38.  Country risk. Pakistan remains a challenging operating environment. Security risks and \nhigh vulnerability to natural disasters (earthquakes and floods) have the potential to disrupt public \nservice delivery and impact individuals and small businesses in particular. KBL has a long track \nrecord of operating in this environment. Its management is cognizant of the challenges and \nmitigates these risks in a number of ways, including a conservatively managed capital position \nand a well-diversified portfolio.  \n \n39.  The proposed loan of up to $20,000,000 or Pakistan rupee equivalent to KBL has an \nobligor risk rating of NSO 1016 and a facility risk rating of NSO 10.   \n                                                \n16 Since the rating after systemic support is NSO 9 and the door-to-door tenor is less than 10 years, the transaction is \neligible for FAST processing. ", "  9 \n \nIV.  DEVELOPMENT IMPACT AND STRATEGIC ALIGNMENT \n \nA.  Development Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n \n40.  Impact. Access to finance for MSMEs and agri-borrowers will increase in alignment with \nthe SBP\u2019s National Financial Inclusion Strategy 2015.17 \n \n41.  Outcome. Increased uptake of financial services by MSMEs and agriculture-related \nclients will provide employment and income benefits for the poor. KBL retains good asset quality. \n \n42.  Outputs. Increased Capacity of KBL to serve MSMEs and agriculture-related clients with \na particular focus on women will result in financing for the underserved in Pakistan through KBL \nas evidenced by (i) KBL\u2019s total loan portfolio growing at a minimum of 20% per annum, (ii) KBL\u2019s \nMSME loans increasing from 3% of the loan portfolio in FY2015 to 30% in FY2024, and (iii) female \nborrowers increasing from 25% of the total loan portfolio in FY2015 to 30% in FY2024. \n \nB.  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations  \n \n43.  Consistency with ADB strategy and country strategy.  Under the Midterm Review of \nStrategy 2020, ADB aims to strengthen its support for the finance sector by  assisting the \ndevelopment of financial infrastructure, institutions, and products and services, and by promoting \ninclusive  growth.18 The  borrower\u2019s  emphasis  on  funding  segments  where  the  potential  for \nemployment and income generation is high will support inclusive growth. The ADB loan will help \nthe borrower provide loans to MSMEs and farmers in order to realize their investment needs. This \nis consistent with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for Pakistan, 2015\u20132019, which specifically \nidentifies inclusive growth through supporting financial services to segments whose access to \nfinance is limited.19 \n \n44.  Consistency with sector strategy and relevant ADB operations. ADB plays a tangible \nrole in supporting the deepening of financial services in Pakistan. ADB has been active in the \nfinance sector since 2000 through the microfinance sector development program, of which KBL \nwas a beneficiary. The proposed loan to KBL will continue to build on ADB\u2019s past efforts in \nsupporting financial inclusion and widening access to finance. \n \n \n \n \nV.  POLICY COMPLIANCE \n \nA.  Safeguards and Social Dimensions   \n \n45.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the senior loan is classified \nas category FI based on potential impacts on the environment, and category FI treated as C for \nimpacts on involuntary resettlement and indigenous peoples. Subloans categorized as A on \nenvironment and A or B on involuntary resettlement and indigenous peoples will not be financed \n                                                \n17 SBP. 2015.

The existing social and environmental management system established by KBL \nwill be enhanced to comply with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement and the requirements of \nADB\u2019s Social Protection Strategy20, and will be adopted before the first disbursement. KBL will \nprohibit  subloans  from  using  ADB  funds  for  any  business  activities  on  ADB\u2019s  prohibited \ninvestment activities list, and will require subloans to abide by applicable national laws and \nregulations. KBL will monitor and provide information on its compliance with the ADB Safeguard \nPolicy Statement and with relevant national laws, standards, and guidelines in the annual report. \nThe project is categorized as effective gender mainstreaming. A gender action plan was prepared \nand provides clear gender targets and monitoring indicators to achieve the desired improvement \nin women\u2019s access to KBL loans.  \n \nB.  Anticorruption Policy  \n \n46.  KBL was advised of ADB\u2019s policy of implementing best international practice relating to \ncombating corruption, money laundering, and the financing of terrorism. ADB will ensure that the \ninvestment  documentation  includes  appropriate  provisions  prohibiting  corruption,  money \nlaundering, and the financing of terrorism, and remedies for ADB in the event of noncompliance.  \n \nC.  Investment Limitations \n \n47.  The  proposed  loan  is  within  the  medium-term,  country,  industry,  group,  and  single \ninvestment exposure limits for nonsovereign investments. \n \nD.  Assurances \n \n48.  Consistent with the Agreement Establishing the Asian Development Bank (the Charter),21 \nADB will proceed with the assistance upon establishing that the Government of Pakistan has no \nobjection to the assistance to KBL. ADB will enter into suitable finance documentation, in form \nand substance satisfactory to ADB.  \n \nVI.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n \n49.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the loan \nof up to $20,000,000 or Pakistan rupee equivalent from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources to \nKhushhali Bank Limited for Expanding Access to Credit for Agriculture and Micro, Small, and \nMedium-Sized Enterprise Borrowers in Pakistan, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n12 December 2016 \n                                                \n20 ADB. 2001.
