An  Initial  Environmental  Examination  (IEE)  was \ncarried out, and the summary IEE is a core appendix. \n \nUnder the Five-Year Plan (NFYP, 2002-2007), the Government of \nBhutan  (the  Government)  intends  to  electrify  15,000  households. \nUnder the project, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) will assist \nthe  Government  to  electrify  about  8,000  rural  consumers,  mostly \nhouseholds,  but  including  hospitals,  schools,  and  other  public \nfacilities  for  local  communities.  The  8,000  consumers  were \nselected based on social and technical criteria to ensure that 43% \nof  the  households  connected  are  below  the  poverty  line.    Based \non  this  criteria,  eight  districts  were  selected  for  the  Project: \nChhukha,  Lhuentse,  Mongar,  Pemagatshel,  Punakha,  Samtse, \nSarpang,  and  Trashigang.    The  Government  expects  to  get \nfinancial assistance from the Government of the Netherlands and \nthe  Government  of  Austria  to  finance  the  electrification  of  4,000 \nhouseholds.    The  Government  is  expected  to  make  funds \navailable to finance the remaining 3,000 households.  The Project \nwill (i) construct 390 circuit kilometers (cct-km) of 33 kilo-volt (kV) \noverhead lines; (ii) construct 300 cct-km of 11 kV overhead lines; \n(iii) \ninstall  160  33/0.4  kV  and  170  11/0.4  kV  distribution \ntransformers  with  associated  drop-out  fuse  assemblies  and  low \nvoltage  (LV)  boards;  (iv)  install  570  cct-km  of  LV  aerial  bundled \nconductors;  and  (v)  installation  of  service  cables  and  energy \nmeters  to  8,000  customers.    The  Government  and  ADB  are  also \nengaged  in  a  long-term  policy  dialogue  to  restructure  the  power \nsector  in  order  to  improve  sector  efficiency.  As  a  result  of  this \ndialogue,  the  former  Department  of  Power  was  unbundled \ncreating  the  Department  of  Energy  (DOE)  as  the  governmental \nplanning agency, Bhutan Electricity Authority (BEA) as the sector \nregulator, and BPC as the a transmission, distribution and supply \ncorporation.  Two  technical  assistance  (TA)  projects  are  piggy-\nbacked  to  the  Project  and  represent  the  next  step  in  sector \nrestructuring. \n \nAlthough Bhutan has substantial sources of clean and renewable \nindigenous  hydropower  energy,  the  distribution  of  electricity \nthroughout  the  country  is  still  limited.    According  to  the  most \nrecent  estimates,  the  population  of  Bhutan  is  about  695,000,  of \nwhom 80% reside in rural areas. About 66,000 of the 85,000 rural \nhouseholds are without electricity. The Project will bring additional \nsocial and economic benefits including improved living standards \nand conditions for education and health service delivery; and  \n\n\f \n\nii\n\n \n\n \nObjectives \n\n \nCost Estimates \n\n \nFinancing Plan \n\n \nLoan Amount and Terms \n\n \nAllocation and Relending \nTerms \n\n \nPeriod of Utilization \n \nEstimated Project \nCompletion Date \n \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\nimproved  opportunities  for  the  rural  and  urban  poor  to  increase \ntheir  economic  productivity,  create  employment  and \nraise \nhousehold  income.  In  addition,  the  Government\u2019s  policy  for  rural \nelectrification  is  to  reduce  fuelwood  consumption  by  using \nelectricity  for  lighting  as  well  as  for  cooking.    The  annual  per \ncapita consumption of fuelwood is at 1.22 tons, one of the highest \nin the world.  Between 45% and 71% of rural households reported \nthey  have  increased  difficulty  in  collecting  fuelwood  due  to  much \ndiminished forest cover compared with ten years ago. \n \nThe  objectives  are  to:  (i)  expand  the  delivery  of  electricity  from \nexisting  national  hydropower  stations  as  an  important  and \nnecessary input for rural residents in Bhutan to improve their living \nstandards,  conditions  for  education,  and  health  service  delivery; \nand  (ii)  provide  opportunities  for  the  rural  poor  to  increase  their \neconomic productivity, create jobs and raise income. \n \nThe Project is estimated to cost $13 million equivalent, comprising \n$9.4  million  in  foreign  exchange  and  $3.6  million  equivalent  in \nlocal currency. \n \n\n($ million) \n\n           Total \n\n    Percentage \n\n                  9.4 \n\nSource               Foreign                Local  \n                          Exchange           Currency \n \nADB \n \nGovernment \n \nTotal \n \n\n                  9.4 \n\n                 3.6 \n\n                    0 \n\n                 3.6 \n\n       0 \n\n              9.4 \n\n            70 \n\n              3.6 \n\n            30 \n\n             13.0 \n\n          100 \n\nIt is proposed that ADB extend a loan of Special Drawing Rights \n6,755,000  ($9.4  million  equivalent)  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds \nresources.    The  loan  will  have  a  repayment  period  of  32  years, \nincluding a grace period of 8 years and an interest charge of 1.0% \nduring the grace period and 1.5% thereafter. \n \nThe  Borrower  will  onlend  to  BPC  under  a  subsidiary  loan \nagreement  with  terms  and  conditions  acceptable  to  ADB.    The \nBorrower will bear the foreign exchange risk. \n \nUntil 31 March 2007 \n \n30 September 2006 \n\n \nA  project  implementation  unit  (PIU)  has  been  established  within \nthe  Development  and  Construction  Department  of  BPC.  A \nmanager  in  BPC  with  experience  in  previous  ADB-financed  rural \nelectrification  (RE)  projects  has  been  appointed  as  project \nmanager.  The project manager will be assisted by an engineer \n\n\f \n\n \nExecuting Agency \n \nProcurement \n\n \nConsulting Services \n\n \nProject Benefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\n \n\niii\n\nand  administrative  staff.    The  project  manager  will  seek  the \nservices and assistance of the Procurement Services Department \nfor  procurement-related  matters  and  the  Finance  Department  for \nfinance-related  matters.    The  majority  of  the  construction  will  be \ncarried out by private contractors under the supervision of BPC\u2019s \nDistribution  Construction  Sections,  in  the  Development  and \nConstruction Department, that is divided into the Eastern, Central \nand Western regions.  The Distribution Construction Sections will \nreport  directly  to  the  project  manager.  Existing  available  facilities \nsuch as computers, vehicles, and warehouses will be used for the \nProject.  \n \nBhutan Power Corporation  \n \nNecessary  equipment  and  materials  for  the  project  will  be \nprocured  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Procurement \nusing  ADB\u2019s  standard  bidding  documents.  Supply  contracts \nestimated  to  cost  $500,000  or  less  will  be  procured  using \ninternational  shopping  procedures.  Packages  with  an  estimated \ncontract  value  of  more  than  $500,000  will  be  procured  through \ninternational competitive bidding.  All contracts for civil works will \nbe procured using local competitive bidding. Approval for advance \naction  has  been  given  to  optimize  time  for  implementing  the \nproject. \n \nAn  international  consulting  firm  will  be  recruited  in  accordance \nwith  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other \narrangements  acceptable  to  the  ADB  for  recruiting  domestic \nconsultants,  using  the  quality-  and  cost-based  method.    It  is \nestimated  that  about  5  person-months  of  international  consulting \nservices  will  be  required.    The  international  consultant  will  assist \nBPC with procurement and design review.  Recruitment of the  \nconsulting firm will be recruited separately for 6 person-months of \nservice on an intermittent basis to assist BPC with monitoring and \nevaluating  project  benefits.    The  domestic  consultants  will  be \nrecruited in time to establish the monitoring system. \n \nThe  Project  will  increase  the  national  electrification  rate  by  8%, \nfrom the current 35% to about 43%. About 43% of the households \nto  be  electrified  are  now  below  the  national  poverty  line  of  about \n$187 per capita per year.  The project has established criteria for \nproviding electrification kits to the poorest households in order to \naddress  the  issue  of  affordability.    The  Project  will  improve \nstandards  of  living  for  these  households  through  the  use  of \n  Electrification  has \nelectric \ngenerated  additional  income-generating  opportunities  through \nseveral  means:  establishment  of  small-scale  cottage  industries, \nengaging  in  mini-food  processing,  increasing  efficiency  in  small \ntrades  such  as  carpentry  and  tailoring,  and  establishing  small \nshops,  bars,  and  restaurants.  It  also  improves  health  standards \ndue to a cleaner environment without kerosene lamps, with less  \n\nlighting  and  other  appliances. \n\n\fiv \n\n \n\n \n\n \nRisks and Assumptions \n\n \nTechnical Assistance \n\nthe \n\nto  prepare \n\ncooking  over  smoky  cooking  fires  in  case  of  houses  with  electric \ncooking appliances, and better preservation of food for houses with \nrefrigerators.  Data  regarding  other  benefits  such  as  increased \nuseful hours for leisure or housekeeping in the evenings, improved \naccess to modern communications and entertainment facilities such \nas radio and TV, and a better overall quality of life with electricity, is \nnot readily available. Thus, these benefits have not been included.  \nBased on these benefits, the estimated economic rate of return for \nthe Project is 12.7%. \n \nThe risks and assumptions follow. (i) Technical risks are minimal \ngiven that two ADB-financed RE loans are already implemented in \nBhutan.    In  addition,  BPC  has  worked  closely  with  the  PPTA \ntechnical  design,  procurement \nconsultants \npackages,  bidding  documents,  and  project \nimplementation \nschedule.  (ii) The Project is economically feasible based on cost \nestimates.    Financially,  BPC  is  financially  viable  and  does  not \nreceive  any  form  of  cash  or  financial  subsidies.  However,  to \nensure  sector  efficiency,  the  Government  will  develop  a  strategy \nand  time-bound  action  plan  to  rationalize  and  target  subsidies  in \nthe power sector to ensure their financial sustainability and review \nBPC\u2019s  weighted  average  tariff  earned  and  its  tariff  structure  to \ndefine  a  reasonable  rate  of  return  for  BPC.    (iii)  Social  risks  are \nminimal  as  the  Project  has  been  designed  in  such  a  way  that \nthere  will  be  no  land  acquisition  or  involuntary  resettlement.    (iv) \nThe environmental risks are also minimal as the distribution lines \nthat  enter  national  parks  only  enter  their  periphery.    To  mitigate \nrisks, BPC will be required to submit an IEE and obtain clearance \nfrom  the  National  Environmental  Commission  before  any  works \nare allowed to commence.  \n \nThere will be TA grants. (i) Capacity Building of BEA for $400,000 \nfrom  the  ADB-funded  TA  program.    The  TA  will:  (a)  conduct  a \nneeds  assessment  of  BEA\u2019s \ninstitutional  requirements,  (b) \ndevelop  and  implement  a  short-  and  medium-term  training \nprogram, (c) assist BEA in developing the national standards and \ncodes  for  the  sector,  (d)  design  and  implement  a  national \noutreach  strategy  to  raise  consumer  awareness  of  BEA  and  its \nrole  as  the  sector  regulator,  and  (e)  review  and  make  a \nrecommendation  on  the  possibility  of  establishing  a  combined \nnational regulatory body that would regulate public utilities, and (ii) \nEstablishing \nfor \n$500,000 from the ADB-funded TA program.  The TA will explore \nthe  institutional,  technical,  economic,  and  financial  feasibility  of \nestablishing DHPC.  To complement the Project and the two TAs, \nthe  Government  of  Japan,  through  the  Japan  International \nCooperation  Agency  (JICA),  will  finance  a  TA,  on  a  grant  and \nparallel  basis, \nthe  Rural \nElectrification Master Plan.  The plan will serve as a road map for \nfuture RE projects in the 10th\u201312th five -year development plans in \norder to meet the national goal of universal electrification by 2020. \n\nthe  Druk  Hydropower  Corporation  (DHPC) \n\nthe  preparation  of \n\nto  support \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n1. \nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto  the  Kingdom  of  Bhutan  for  the  Rural  Electrification  and  Network  Expansion  Project.    The \nreport also describes proposed technical assistance (TA) for (i) Capacity Building of the Bhutan \nElectricity  Authority,  and  (ii)  Establishment  of  the  Druk  Hydropower  Corporation,  and  if  the \nBoard approves the proposed loan, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, \nwill approve the two TAs. \n \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nA. \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\nThe  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  provided  a  project  preparatory  TA1  with  the \n2. \nobjective of (i) establishing the technical, economic, financial, and social feasibility of the project; \nand  (ii)  providing  the  Department  of  Energy  (DOE)  and  the  Bhutan  Power  Corporation  (BPC) \nwith capacity for preparing similar future projects for external financing.  The project framework \nis in Appendix 1. \n \nMost  of  Bhutan\u2019s  power  comes  from  run-of-the-river  hydropower  from  the  four  major \n3. \nrivers: Ammochu, Mangdechhu, Samkosh, and Wangchu. Currently, Bhutan has 26 hydropower \nstations with a total installed capacity of about 445 megawatts (MW) and a maximum demand of \n96  MW.    There  are  currently  three  main  generating  companies:  Chhukha  Hydropower \nCorporation  (CHPC,  336  MW,  funded  by  India)  and  the  Baso  Chhu  (Phase  1)  Hydropower \nCorporation  (BHPC,  24  MW,  funded  by  Austria)  in  the  Western  Region  and  Kurichhu \nHydropower  Corporation  (KHPC,  60MW,  funded  by  India)  in  the  Eastern  Region.  All  three \ncompanies are wholly Government-owned.  Although CHPC, KHPC, and BHPC provide most of \nthe power capacity, there are eight mini-hydro plants with capacities ranging from 300 kilowatt \n(kW) to 2,200 kW, and 15 microhydro plants with capacities ranging from 8 kW to 200 kW. The \ntotal installed capacity of microhydro plants has reached about 1,000 kW.  Baso Chhu Phase 2 \nwill be completed in 2004 (40 MW, funded by Austria) and the Tala Hydropower Project (THPC, \n1,020 MW, funded by India) will be completed by 2006.  The theoretical potential hydropower in \nBhutan  is  30,000  MW.    DOE  has  conducted  prefeasibility  and  feasibility  studies  on  projects \ntotaling  16,280  MW.    Further,  the  Governments  of  Norway  and  Japan  have  funded  full-scale \ntechnical feasibility studies for the Mangdechhu Hydropower Project (completed in 1999 for 360 \nMW) and Punatsangchu Hydropower Project (completed in 2001 for 870 MW). \n \n4. \nHydropower  is  Bhutan\u2019s  most  important  natural  resource.    Because  the  country \ngenerates  significantly  more  electricity  than  it  consumes,  Bhutan  is  a  net  power  exporter.    In \nFY2001,  power  exports  of  1,380  gigawatt-hours  (77  percent  of  the  energy  the  country \ngenerated) to India accounted for over 43% of the national revenue.  Almost all this power came \nfrom CHPC and as such, CHPC is the largest single foreign exchange earner of Bhutan.  Under \nthe current power purchase agreement with India, CHPC and KHPC are under no obligation to \nexport  any  fixed  amount  of  capacity  or  energy  to  India.    Their  first  priority  is  to  supply  the \nnecessary  electricity  to  BPC  for  domestic  consumers.    Only  the  balance  of  the  country\u2019s \nelectricity  output  is  to  be  exported  to  India.    As  such,  there  is  no  excess  generation  capacity.  \nGiven this situation, the Government has put the highest priority on developing its hydropower \n\n                                                 \n1   ADB.  2001. Technical  Assistance  to  the  Kingdom  of  Bhutan  for  the  preparation  of  the  Rural  Electrification  and \n\nNetwork Extension Project. Manila \n\n\f2 \n\npotential  as  it  represents  Bhutan\u2019s  most  important  source  for  economic  growth  and \ndevelopment, with minimal environmental impacts. \n \n5. \nUnder  the  current  power  sector  structure,  DOE  serves  as  the  policy-making  and \nplanning  body  for  the  Government,  with  BPC  as  the  transmission,  distribution  and  supply \ncompany and the Bhutan Electricity Authority (BEA) as the sector regulator. \n \n6. \nThe  five-year  average  of  the  load  growth  of  energy  before  FY2001  was  approximately \n12%  per  annum.  The  load  growth  for  the  next  five  years  is  likely  to  remain  the  same.    The \nhistoric  annual  load  growth  of  the  residential  and  commercial  customers  is  about  5%  per \nannum.  By  the  end  of  FY2002,  BPC  consumers  totaled  about  37,000.    The  Department  of \nPower2  (DOP)  and  BPC  have  electrified  40  towns  and  737  rural  villages.    The  Project  will \nincrease  the  total  number  of  consumers  served  by  BPC  by  about  20%.  It  will  result  in  an  8% \nincrease in the total proportion of the national population with electricity supply, from the current \nrate of 35% to about 43%. The average system loss of transmission and distribution including \nnontechnical  losses  in  the  past  five  years  was  about  9%.  This  performance  is  due  mainly \n(approximately 15%) to the large share of the high voltage customers.  The detailed energy and \npower sector analysis and tables outlining the statistics of the power sector, consumption data, \npower generation, and transmission are in Appendix 2. \n \nB. \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\n1. \n\nNature of Rural Electrification in Bhutan \n\n \n \nGiven  Bhutan\u2019s  mountainous  terrain  and  highly  dispersed  population,  the  expansion  of \n7. \nthe  rural  electrification  (RE)  network  system  poses  additional  challenges.    The  RE  system \nexpansion  has  outpaced  the  extension  of  the  road  network.    As  a  result,  the  cost  of  grid \nextension  and  household  connections  are  high,  currently  averaging  about  $1,400  per \nhousehold.    Costs  will  increase  even  further  as  RE  moves  to  even  more  remote  villages  and \nhouseholds.  Given this situation, DOE, BPC, and ADB have worked hard on the technical and \neconomic  balance  in  the  design  of  the  Project  to  ensure  subprojects  that  are  techno-\neconomically feasible.  However, for future RE extension, the subprojects will be in even more \nremote areas as the more accessible villages are usually the ones to get electrified first.  This \nwill  affect  the  technical  as  well  as  economic  viability  of  future  grid  extension.    Future  projects \nmay have to weigh the benefits and the costs of grid extension against off-grid applications such \nas micro and minihydro stations with a small grid, community solar photo-voltaic (PV) charging \nstations, or household PV systems. \n \n\n2. \n\nCapacity Building and Sector Restructuring \n\n \nADB  has  provided  four  advisory  TAs  in  the  power  sector.3  The  thrust  of  ADB\u2019s \n8. \nassistance  has  been  to  strengthen  and  reform  the  power  sector  to  improve  efficiency.  \nConsidering the human resource constraints, the Government and ADB agreed to implement a \nseries of sequenced TAs that together, would restructure and strengthen the power sector over \neight  years.    The  TAs  have  helped  to  build  the  institutional  capacity  of  DOP,  established  the \n\n                                                 \n2   Prior to the establishment of BPC, DOP served as the electricity utility. \n3   ADB.  1992.

As a result of the \nTAs, the Government decided to restructure the power sector.  On 1 July 2002, after three years \nof preparatory work, DOP was unbundled and DOE was created as the governmental planning \nagency,  BEA  as  the  sector  regulator,  and  BPC  as  a  transmission,  distribution  and  supply \ncorporation.    This  was  a  significant  step  forward  to  improving  sector  efficiency  and  delivery  of \nservice. \n \n9. \nTo  complete  the  unbundling  of  DOP  and  the  establishment  of  BPC,  the  Government \nneeds  to  appoint  a  full-time  managing  director  to  BPC.    Currently,  the  director,  DOE  is  also \nserving as the acting managing director of BPC.  Because of human resource constraints, the \ngovernment  has  not  yet  been  able  to  appoint  a  full  time  managing  director.    The  Government \nindicated  that  a  full-time  managing  director  for  BPC  is  expected  to  be  in  place  by  the  end  of \n2003.    Further,  as  a  next  step  in  the  ongoing  dialogue  and  collaboration  between  the \nGovernment and ADB on power sector reforms, two TAs are attached to the Project to (i) help \nthe  Government  study  the  possibility  of  establishing  a  single  holding  company,  the  Druk \nHydropower  Corporation  (DHPC),  to  own  and  manage  each  of  Bhutan\u2019s  major  hydropower \nstations.  If feasible, DHPC will be created according to a timeframe to be agreed upon by ADB \nand RGOB; and (ii) institutional capacity building for BEA.  Six months after the completion of \nthe  TA,  BEA  will  be  moved  out  from  DOE  and  established  as  a  fully  independent  sector \nregulator.  For 2004, ADB has programmed a TA project to explore the conditions necessary for \nprivate sector participation in hydropower generation.   \n  \n\n3. \n\nLessons Learned from Previous RE Loans \n\n \nADB had provided three project preparatory TAs4 and financed two loans for RE.5  The \n10. \nLoan  for  the  Rural  Electrification  Project  was  delayed  by  approximately  one  year  because  of \nprocurement issues, problems in logistical arrangements related to transportation and storage, \ninexperienced local contractors, and force majeure (heavy rains) in 1998.  However, the project \nwas satisfactorily completed in 1999.  The loan for the Sustainable Rural Electrification Project \nalso started slowly because of procurement delays, but is now on track to be completed by the \nloan closing date of April 2004.  The loan is projected to electrify about 7,000 households, over \n800 more than the 6,028 that were originally targeted for the project.   \n \n11. \nThe Project will benefit from the lessons learned from the previous two RE projects that \nADB has financed.6  The general quality of construction in the first two projects is good and all \ninstallations generally conform to the technical specifications.  The installations should provide a \nreliable electricity supply to BPC\u2019s customers.  The lessons learned from the previous projects \nfollow.  (i) Standardization of equipment. The technical design for the RE program under the 9th \nFive-Year  Plan  (NFYP),  including  the  Project,  specifically  focused  on  standardizing  the  plant \nand materials for BPC.  This will result in efficiencies in procuring plant and materials, operating \nand maintaining the system, training staff, and reduce stores inventories, and therefore, overall \n                                                 \n4   ADB. 1993.

Manila. \n\n6   Operations Evaluation Department is currently preparing a project performance audit report for Loan 1375-BHU: \nRural Electrification Project and a TA performance audit report for the three institutional strengthening TAs in the \npower sector in Bhutan. \n\n\f4 \n\ncost  savings  for  BPC,  (ii)  Suitability  of  plant  and  material  for  local  conditions.    Given  local \nconditions in Bhutan, the expanding RE system faces additional challenges as the RE system \nhas  outpaced  the  road  network  and  rural  households  are  not  clustered  but  highly  dispersed \naround  the  countryside.    Therefore,  much  of  the  plant  and  material  need  to  be  hand-carried \nacross rough and severely undulating terrain.  For example, a typical line extension may involve \ncarrying a 640 kilogram 11/.4 kV 63 kVA transformer and necessary conductors, insulators, etc. \nup and down steep and rough terrain by teams of 15-20 porters.  As such, plant and materials \nhave to be designed and packaged for rough handling, while at the same time, being as light as \npossible.  The technical specifications for plant and material for the Project will include special \nclauses  to  address  this  issue,  and  (iii)  Need  for  adequate  survey.  The  ongoing  Sustainable \nRural  Electrification  Project  suffered  from  inadequate  survey.    As  a  result,  BPC  often  had  to \nreorder  additional  plant  and  material,  and  experienced  additional  costs  and  implementation \ndelays.  The design for the Project includes detailed line drawings for the subprojects (para. 21).  \nThe  result  will  be  greater  accuracy  of  the  bill  of  quantity  and  greater  efficiency  in  project \nimplementation. \n \n\n4. \n\nNeed for Greater Resource Efficiency \n\n \n12. \nBhutan  generates  significantly  more  power  than  it  consumes  and  all  the  excess  power \ngenerated  is  sold  to  India.    Revenues  from  the  power  sector,  representing  over  43%  of  the \nnational revenue, help pay for government expenditures in all other sectors.  As such, the power \nsector is the single most important sector in Bhutan and will be the engine for economic growth \nand development.   \n \nThe  Government  has  also  chosen  to  transfer  this  wealth  from  the  power  sector  to  its \n13. \npeople  by  keeping  domestic  electricity  tariffs  low.    In  doing  so,  it  has  taken  into  account  the \nfollowing  factors:  (i)  service  coverage  is  still  poor  and  about  66,000  of  the  85,000  rural \nhouseholds remain without access to electricity and the social and economic benefits it offers; \n(ii) the Government\u2019s policy is to decrease greenhouse gas emissions by replacing kerosene for \nlighting and fuel-wood for cooking with electricity; (iii) revenue to be generated from increased \nelectricity  sales  to  India  is  forecast  to  rise  substantially  to  $84  million  by  FY2006  with  the \ncommissioning of THPC, to $121 million by FY2013 with the commissioning of Punatsangchhu \nhydropower project, and to $140 million by FY2016 with the Mangdechhu hydropower project. \n \n14. \nBPC  was  established  in  July  2002  to  take  over  the  utility  functions  of  DOP  to  improve \nsector  efficiency  and  service  delivery.  BPC  has  two  main  profit  activities:    transmission  and \ndistribution of electricity. BPC will produce its first financial statement (for a reporting period of \n18  months)  on  31  December  2003.  Based  on  the  projections,  BPC\u2019s  domestic  electricity \noperation  (both  transmission  and  distribution)  will  result  in  a  profit  before  tax  of  Nu131  million \n(Appendix  3).  Therefore,  BPC  is  financially  viable  and  does  not  receive  any  financial  subsidy.  \nHowever,  there  are  significant  cross-subsidies  within  the  sector.  BPC\u2019s  transmission  activities \ncontribute only 30% to its revenue but 66% of its profits, while its distribution activities contribute \n70% of its revenue but only 30% of its profits.  Further, the average weighted cost of power is \nNu0.71/kWh.  For  high  voltage  (HV)  sales,  which  make  up  approximately  60%  of  total  BPC \ndomestic sales, Nu0.386 is contributed per kWh. For medium voltage (MV) sales, which make \nup approximately 20% of total BPC domestic kWh sales, Nu0.133 is contributed per kWh. For \nlow  voltage  (LV)  sales  to  rural  and  urban  consumers7,  which  make  up  the  remaining  20%  of \ntotal  BPC\u2019s  domestic  kWh  sales,  a  cross  subsidy  is  provided  by  HV  and  MV  sales,  i.e. \n\n                                                 \n7   The  term  \u201cconsumers\u201d  is  used  here  as  LV  sales  include  households  and  commercial  users  such  as  shops, \n\nrestaurants, hotels, offices, etc. \n\n\f5 \n\nNu2.580/kWh  sold  to  rural  consumers  and  Nu0.399/kWh  sold  to  urban  consumers.    The \nGovernment  has  to  review  these  cross  subsidies  to  ensure  that  they  are  justifiable  and  well \ntargeted. \n \nIn  addition,  although,  there  is  no  cash  or  financial  subsidy  to  BPC,  it  is  important  to \n15. \nensure  that  electricity  is  not  wasted  and  for  the  sector  to  operate  with  maximum  efficiency \nbecause  electricity  sold  domestically  has  an  opportunity  cost  in  terms  of  the  higher  revenue \navailable  from  electricity  sales  to  India.      This  opportunity  cost  is  estimated  at  $12.7  million  a \nyear.8    The  Government\u2019s  position  is  that  this  revenue  loss  also  serves  to  transfer  the  wealth \nearned  from  power  sales  to  India  as  additional  benefits  to  its  citizens  and  also  broaden  the \neconomic  base  of  Bhutan.    For  rural  and  urban  households,  social  and  economic  benefits \ninclude improved living standards and conditions for education and health service delivery; and \nimproved  opportunities  for  the  rural  and  urban  poor  to  increase  their  economic  productivity, \nobtain employment, and raise household income.  \n \n\n5. \n\nPrivate Sector Participation  \n\n \n16. \nThe  Rural  Electrification  Project  and  the  early  phases  of  the  Sustainable  Rural \nElectrification  Project  used  its  own  labor  force  for  civil  works.  This  proved  inefficient  as  DOP \nonly  had  a  limited  number  of  workers.  To  catch  up  on  delays  in  the  early  part  of  the  ongoing \nSustainable Rural Electrification Project, BPC has begun to use private contractors to expedite \nimplementation.    However,  their  bidding  documents  were  not  adequate  to  ensure  that  the  line \nalignments and  estimates  of line  materials  are accurate.   As  a  result, many  of  the  contractors \ndid not align the lines properly.  The results were increased costs and shortage of line materials.  \nBPC expects to continue to use private contractors for the Project so as not to have the same \nproblem,  the  Project  will  have  detailed  line  drawings,  including  marking  landmarks  for \ntransformers and poles to guide the contractors.   \n \nBhutan currently faces a shortage of skilled labor, including licensed electricians for the \n17. \ninternal wiring of newly electrified households.  To address this problem, the National Technical \nTraining Authority has developed programs for electricians, especially in rural areas.  However, \nthere  continues  to  be  a  shortage  of  qualified  electricians.    For  the  Project,  the  use  of  private \ncontractors  for  erection  and  stringing  will  also  provide  a  pool  of  skilled  electricians  for  internal \nwiring.    According  to  BPC,  experience  in  the  current  Sustainable  Rural  Electrification  Project \nshows that when a contractor begins to work in a district, he advertises his services for internal \nwiring.  If his prices are reasonable, the villagers will hire him.  If they are too high, the villagers \nwill  find  others  to  do  their  internal  wiring.    The  use  of  the  private  sector  will  help  alleviate  the \nshortage of electricians. \n \n\n6. \n\nAid Coordination \n\n \n18. \nADB  is  one  of  the  main  funding  agencies  involved  in  power  sector  restructuring, \ndistribution reforms, and RE expansion.  In the NFYP, in addition to the Project, the Government \nis  in  negotiations  with  the  Sustainable  Development  Secretariat  (SDS,  funded  by  the \nNetherlands)  to  finance  the  electrification  of  about  3,000  rural  households  and  the  Austrian \nCoordination Bureau (ACB) to finance about 1,000 households on a parallel basis.  Both SDS \nand  ACB  are  expected  to  use  the  technical  designs  and  economic,  financial,  social,  and \nenvironmental  analyses  prepared  by  the  ADB-financed  PPTA.    The  Government  of  Japan,  is \nsupporting the preparation of the Rural Electrification Master Plan that will serve as a road map \n\n                                                 \n8   For details of the opportunity cost calculations, see Supplemental Appendix B. \n\n\f6 \n\nfor future RE projects in the 10th\u201312th five-year development plans.  The Norwegian Agency for \nDevelopment Cooperation is providing assistance to DOE to strengthen BEA.  The Government \nof  India  is  the  primary  source  involved  with  providing  assistance  to  develop  Bhutan\u2019s \nhydropower  potential,  financing  THPC  and  transmission  lines  to  evacuate  power  from  KHPC, \nand  THPC,  when  it  is  completed.  A  list  of  external  assistance  to  the  power  sector  since  1983 \nprovided in Appendix 4.  \n  \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nObjectives \n\nThe  proposed  loan  will  fund  a  poverty  intervention  project  with  economic  growth  as  its \n19. \nthematic classification.  The objectives are to (i) expand the delivery of electricity from existing \nnational hydropower stations as an important and necessary input to rural residents in Bhutan to \nimprove  their  living  standards,  conditions  for  education,  and  health  service  delivery;  and  (ii) \nprovide  the  rural  poor  with  opportunities  to  increase  their  economic  productivity,  create  and \nobtain jobs, and raise their income.  \n \nB. \n\nComponents and Outputs \n\n20. \nUnder the NFYP, the Government intends to electrify 15,000 households.  ADB provided \na  PPTA  to  DOE  and  BPC  to  undertake  the  technical  design,  and  financial,  economic,  social, \nand  environmental  analyses  for  electrifying  the  15,000  households  and  other  consumers.    Of \nthe 15,000 households, the Project will electrify about 8,000 rural consumers and a population \nof about 50,000.  The Project will also electrify hospitals, schools, and other public facilities for \nlocal  communities.    This  will  correspond  to  an  increase  of  about  20%  in  the  total  number  of \nconsumers served by BPC, or an 8% increase in the total proportion of the national population \nwith electricity supply, from the current 35% to about 43%. The 8,000 consumers were selected \nbased on social and technical criteria to ensure that 43% of the households connected are living \nbelow the poverty line (para. 21).  The project will (i) construct 390 circuit kilometers (cct-km) of \n33 kilo-volt (kV) overhead lines; (ii) construct 300 cct-km of 11 kV overhead lines; (iii) install 160 \n33/0.4 kV and 170 11/0.4 kV distribution transformers with associated drop-out fuse assemblies \nand  low  voltage  (LV)  boards;  (iv)  install  570  cct-km  of  LV  aerial  bundled  conductors;  and  (v) \ninstallation of service cables and energy meters to 8,000 customers.   \n \nC. \n\nSpecial Features - Selection of Subprojects and Ensuring Affordability \n\n21. \nFor  the  ongoing  Sustainable  Rural  Electrification  Project,  the  beneficiaries  were  not \nsufficiently  targeted  during  project  design.    Therefore,  to  meet  the  targeted  number  of \nbeneficiaries  under  the  poverty  line,  the  project  skipped  certain  houses  and  villages  during \nproject  implementation  and  thus  caused  social  problems.    In  addition,  it  was  very  difficult  to \nquantify  the  number  of  poor  beneficiaries.    For  the  Project,  a  socioeconomic  assessment  of \n3,000 sample households was undertaken prior to technical design9.  Using the socioeconomic \ndata,  criteria  were  established  for  selecting  subprojects  to  target  the  necessary  beneficiaries \nbelow the poverty line.  The criteria included the project\u2019s poverty intervention criterion (i.e., 43 \nof  the  households  connected  are  living  below  the  poverty  line),  EIRR  of  subprojects  (above \n10%),  total  costs  of  connecting  each  household  (not  to  exceed  $1,700)  and  resettlement  and \nenvironmental considerations.  Further, the Project deemed it more effective to focus on specific \n\n                                                 \n9   The survey is the largest household survey to have been carried out in Bhutan. \n\n\f7 \n\ndistricts, or subprojects, rather than spread the 8,000 connections among all 20 districts.  Based \non  the  criteria,  Chhukha,  Lhuentse,  Mongar,  Pemagatshel,  Punakha,  Samtse,  Sarpang,  and \nTrashigang districts were selected. \n \nFree  electrification  kits  will  be  distributed  to  approximately  3,450  households  on  the \n22. \nbasis  of  the  following  criteria:  (i)  two  rooms,  including  kitchen;  (ii)  type  of  house  construction: \nsingle-story  mud  house,  stone  house  with  wood  roofing;  (iii)  vulnerable  households  to  include \nfemale-headed  and  landless  households  and  households  without  cash  income;  and  (vi) \nhouseholds that are not yet connected six months after other houses in the village have been \nelectrified. \n \nD. \n\nCost Estimates \n\n23. \nThe  Project  is  estimated  to  cost  $13  million  equivalent,  comprising  $9.4  million  in  foreign \nexchange and $3.6 million equivalent in local currency.

BPC is governed by a board of seven directors with the \nMinister  of  Trade  and  Industry  as  the  chair.10    BPC  is  headed  by  a  managing  director  and \ncomprises six departments (Appendix 5). Under the Project, a project implementation unit (PIU) \nhas been established within the Development and Construction Department. A manager in BPC \nwith  experience  in  previous  ADB-financed  rural  electrification  projects11  was  appointed  as \nproject  manager  on  31  May  2003.  The  project  manager  will  be  assisted  in  the  PIU  by  an \nengineer  and  several  administrative  staff.    The  project  manager  will  seek  the  services  and \nassistance  of  the  Procurement  Services  Department  for  procurement-related  matters  and  the \nFinance Department for finance-related matters. The majority of the construction will be carried \nout by private contractors under the supervision of BPC Distribution Construction Section, under \nthe  Development  and  Construction  Department,  that  is  divided  into  the  Eastern,  Central  and \nWestern  regions.    The  Distribution  Construction  Sections  will  report  directly  to  the  Project \nManger.  The project management structure is in Appendix 6.  Existing available facilities such \nas computer equipment, vehicles, and warehouses will be used for the Project. \n \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Schedule and Performance Review \n\n27. \nThe Project will be implemented over four years.  Physical implementation is expected to \nbegin  in  February  2005  and  end  by  September  2006,  six  months  before  the  anticipated  loan \nclosing in March 2007. The detailed implementation schedule is shown in Appendix 7.  BPC will \n                                                 \n10   The other six  board members are Cabinet  Secretary, Director General of Department of Aid and  Development \nManagement,  MOF,  Managing  Director,  BPC,  Managing  Director,  Chhukha  Power  Company,  Director, \nDepartment of Energy, and Principal, Royal Bhutan Institute of Technology. \n\n11   ADB. 1995.

ADB  will  also  monitor  overall \nperformance of BPC through the quarterly progress reports. \n \n\n \n\n3. \n\nProcurement \n\nEquipment  and  materials  for  the  project  will  be  procured  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \n28. \nGuidelines  for  Procurement  using  ADB\u2019s  standard  bidding  documents.  A  list  of  contract \npackages  is  in  Appendix  8.  Supply  contracts  estimated  to  cost  $500,000  or  less,  will  be \nprocured  using  international  shopping  procedures.  Packages  with  an  estimated  contract  value \nof more than $500,000 will be procured through international competitive bidding.  Because of \nthe  dispersed  project  sites,  civil  works  have  been  packaged  into  three  contracts  of  less  than \n$1,000,000 each.  All civil works contracts will be financed by the Government, using standard \nGovernment  procedures.    Approval  for  advance  action  has  been  given  to  optimize  time  for \nimplementing the project. \n \n\n \n\n4. \n\nConsulting Services \n\nAs BPC has successfully completed the Rural Electrification Project and implementation \n29. \nof  the  Sustainable  Rural  Electrification  Project  is  satisfactory,  a  limited  amount  of  consulting \nservices  will  be  required  for  project  implementation.    An  international  consulting  firm  will  be \nrecruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants using the quality and \ncost-based method and simplified technical proposals.  About 5 person-months of international \nconsulting  services  will  be  required.    The  international  consultants  will  assist  BPC  with \nprocurement  and  design  review.    Recruitment  of  the  international  consultants  has  begun.    A \ndomestic consulting firm will be recruited separately for 6 person-months of intermittent service \nto assist BPC with monitoring and evaluating project benefits.  The domestic consultants will be \nrecruited  in  time  to  establish  the  monitoring  system.    The  outline  terms  of  reference  for \nconsulting services are in Appendix 9. \n \n\n \n5. \n\nAdvance Procurement Action \n\n30. \nTo  expedite  implementation,  advance  action  for  procuring  goods  and  recruiting \nimplementation  consultants  was  approved  during  the  management  review  meeting.      The \nGovernment has been advised, and understands, that ADB\u2019s approval of such advance action \nwill  not  in  any  way  commit  ADB  to  approve  the  project  subsequently  or  to  finance  the  costs \nincurred.  \n \n\n6. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n31. \nDisbursements  under  the  Project  will  be  mainly  for  the  supply  of  goods  and  consulting \nservices.    ADB\u2019s  commitment  letter  and  direct  payment  procedures  will  be  used  for \ndisbursement purposes. \n \n\n \n\n7. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\nBPC  will prepare regular progress reports and submit them to ADB every quarter. The \n32. \nreports  will  include  a  description  of  physical  progress,  problems  and  difficulties  encountered, \ncompliance  with  loan  covenants,  and  summary  of  financial  accounts  for  the  Project.  A  project \n\n\f10 \n\ncompletion report will be submitted to ADB within three months after completion of the project.  \nBPC  will  maintain  separate  accounts  for  the  project.  Within  nine  months  of  the  close  of  each \nfinancial year, starting from October 2004, audited project accounts and financial statements for \nBPC and the Project will be submitted. \n \n\n \n\n8. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n33. \nThe specific objectives of the project performance and monitoring system (PPMS) are to \nidentify the key criteria and indicators for macro-level monitoring of project inputs, outputs, and \nimpacts.    PPMS  will  enable  BPC  and  ADB  to  determine  the  efficiency  and  effectiveness  of \nproject  implementation,  identify  constraints,  and  measure  the  performance  and  impact  of  the \nProject.    The  information  gained  will  be  used  directly  to  improve  development  planning  and \nimplementation  by  adjusting  delivery  mechanisms  and  identifying  more  appropriate  strategies.  \nBPC  will  carry  out  routine  monitoring  of  construction  progress  as  well  social  benefits  derived \nfrom RE. \n \n\nIV. \n\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n\nCapacity Building of the Bhutan Electricity Authority \n\n34. \nTwo  TAs  are  associated  with  the  Project.    Both  are  based  on  the  findings  and \nrecommendations  of  the  Policy  and  Legal  Framework  for  Power  Sector  Development  and  are \npart of the ongoing policy dialogue between the Government and ADB. \n \nA. \n \nThe  TA  will  provide  BEA  staff  the  technical  skills  and  experience  to  carry  out  their \n35. \nmandate.  The TA will have five components: (i) conduct an assessment of BEA\u2019s institutional \nrequirements;  (ii)  assist  BEA  develop  a  short-  and  medium-term  training  program;  (iii)  assist \nBEA in developing the national standards and codes for the sector; (iv) assist BEA design and \nimplement a national outreach strategy to raise consumer awareness of BEA and its role as the \nsector regulator; and (v) review and give recommendations on the possibility of establishing a \ncombined  national  regulatory  body  for  public  utilities.  The  outline  terms  of  reference  for  the \nconsultants  are  in  Appendix  10.    The  detailed  TA  paper  is  a  supplemental  appendix  and  is \navailable upon request. \n \n36. \nThe total cost of the TA is estimated at $480,000 equivalent, comprising about $368,000 \nin  foreign  exchange  and  about  $112,000  equivalent  in  local  currency  costs.    ADB  will  provide \n$400,000,  comprising  $368,000  in  foreign  exchange  costs  and  $32,000  equivalent  of  local \ncurrency cost.  The TA will be financed on a grant basis by the ADB-funded TA program.  The \nGovernment will finance the remaining $80,000 equivalent of the local currency costs.  DOE will \nbe the Executing Agency for the TA. \n \nB. \n\nEstablishment of the Druk Hydropower Corporation (DHPC) \n \n37. \nThe  TA  will  review  the  institutional,  technical,  economic,  and  financial  feasibility  of \nestablishing  DHPC.    The  study  will  recommend  DHPC\u2019s  institutional  setup  and  an  efficient \nbusiness  plan  for  operating  and  maintaining  hydropower  generation  plants  in  an  integrated \nmanner.    The  TA  will  have  three  parts,  to  be  implemented  sequentially:  (i)  policy  and \nhydropower sector review, (ii) detailed design of DHPC, and (iii) final design.   The outline terms \nof  reference  for  the  consultant  is  in  Appendix  11.    The  detailed  TA  paper  is  a  supplemental \nappendix and is available upon request. \n \n\n\f11 \n\nThe total cost of the TA is estimated at $600,000 equivalent, comprising about $475,000 \n38. \nin  foreign  exchange  and  about  $125,000  equivalent  in  local  currency  costs.  ADB  will  provide \n$500,000,  comprising  $475,000  in  foreign  exchange  costs  and  $25,000  equivalent  of  local \ncurrency cost.  The TA will be financed on a grant basis by the ADB-funded TA program.  The \nGovernment  will  finance  the  remaining  $100,000  equivalent  of  the  local  currency  costs.    DOE \nwill be the Executing Agency for the TA and DHPC will be the Implementing Agency. \n \nC. Rural Electrification Master Plan \n \n39. \nTo  complement  the  project  and  the  two  TAs,  the  Government  of  Japan,  through  the \nJapan  International  Cooperation  Agency,  will  finance,  on  a  grant  and  parallel  basis,  TA  to \nsupport the preparation of the Rural Electrification Master Plan that will serve as a road map for \nfuture RE projects under the 10th\u201312th five year development plans in order to meet the national \ngoal of universal electrification by 2020.   \n \n\nV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n\nSocial Aspects \n\nA. \n \n\n1. \n\nPoverty and Social Issues \n\n \n40. \nThe Project will give about 8,000 households access to electricity. About 43% are below \nthe  national  poverty  line  of  $187  per  capita  per  year.  The  targeted  districts  have  a  sufficient \nnumber  of  poor  and  vulnerable  households  among  the  20  districts.  Social  and  poverty \ninformation was obtained from primary data collected through the ADB study on Socioeconomic \nImpacts of Rural Electrification (Phase 1 Survey), information from the Household Income and \nExpenditure  Survey  (HEIS),  the  Poverty  Assessment  and  Analysis  Report  2000,  the \nComprehensive  Food  Security  Programme  Report  and  rapid  rural  assessment  (RRA).  The \nproject  targets  eight  districts  where,  according  to  Phase  1  survey,  in  six  districts  23%  of  the \nhouseholds fall below the poverty line and 69% fall into the category of vulnerable households. \nThe  remaining  two  districts  have  food  insecurity  and  therefore,  are  well  within  the  vulnerable \ncategory. The targeting of poor and vulnerable districts for electrification will avoid the problem \nof poverty targeting experienced in previous RE projects.  \n \n41. \nFocus  group  discussions  and  surveys  based  on  previous  projects  indicate  that \nbeneficiaries  report  considerable  value  addition  to  the  quality  of  their  life  as  a  result  of \nelectrification. It is expected that in addition to quality of life improvements, electricity will provide \nopportunities  for  households  to  improve  incomes  by  establishing  new  businesses  and/or \nexpanding  current  ones.  Electrification  has  generated  additional \nincome-generating \nopportunities through several means: establishment of small-scale cottage industries, engaging \nin  mini-food  processing,  increasing  efficiency  in  small  trades  such  as  carpentry  and  tailoring, \nand establishing small shops, bars, and restaurants. Households below the poverty line use an \naverage 51 kilowatt-hour (kWh) of electricity per month with an average cost of about Nu30. The \nminimum  charge  by  BPC  is  Nu35.  Without  electricity,  5  liters  of  kerosene  used  for  lighting  by \nlow-income  households  costs  about  Nu60  a  month.  Monthly  electricity  bills  are  only  half  this \namount.   \n \n42.  Women  are  expected  to  benefit  through  additional  lighting,  reduced  time  spent  on \ncollecting fuelwood, use of rice cookers that also reduce indoor smoke pollution, and increased \nlight  and/or  motive  power  for  home  based  income-generating  activities  such  as  weaving.   \n\n\f 12\n\nReplacing  kerosene  with  electricity  will  result  in  a  cleaner  environment,  improved  indoor  living \nconditions, and better health.   \n \n43. \nIn  addition  to  routine  PPMS,  BPC  will  engage  consultants  to  undertake  benefit \nmonitoring and evaluation of social and poverty benefits. An outline of the terms of reference for \nthe  consultant  are  in  Appendix  9.    A  Summary  Poverty  and  Social  Impact  Assessment  is  in \nAppendix 12. \n \n44. \nlinguistic groups will have access to electricity. \n \n\nThe  project  will  not  have  any  adverse  impact  on  indigenous  peoples  and  all  ethno-\n\n2. \n\nLand Acquisition and Resettlement \n\nFinancial Aspects \n\n \n45. \nBPC  reviewed  the  technical  design  to  explore  opportunities  for  minimizing  land \nacquisition.  Appropriate  technical  solutions  were  found.  The  project  will  not  entail  compulsory \nland  acquisition,  as  all  transformers  will  be  pole  mounted.  Angle  and  distribution  poles  will  be \nplaced, to the extent possible, close to bunds, leaving adequate distance for house expansion \nand avoid lands that belong to households that have less than 1 acre.  BPC will also ensure that \npublic and private access is not obstructed. \n \nB. \n \n46. \nBPC  was  only  recently  established    (July  2002)  and  has  not  yet  produced  a  full  set  of \ncertified financial statements. BPC will produce its first financial statement for the first 18 months \nof operation on 31 December 2003. However, BPC has developed a five-year financial forecast.  \nThey  are  based  on  BPC  estimates  of  its  current  financial  position;  forecast  estimates  of  sales \ngrowth  (number  of  customers  and  kWh  consumption  per  customer),  increase  in  tariffs,  and \nincrease  in  operations  as  well  as  capital  expenditure.  Based  on  these  assumptions,  BPC  is \nfinancially viable in the short term. However, this assumes a low bulk supply price of electricity \nto  BPC,  and  substantial  cross-subsidies  from  HV  and  MV  customers  to  LV  rural  and  urban \ncustomers.  Moreover,  it  assumes  strong  rates  of  growth:  number  of  customers,  kWh  sales, \nincrease  in  tariffs,  and  increase  in  financed  expenditure  levels.  It  will  therefore  be  critical for \nBPC  to  finalize  its  corporate  strategy  and  business  plan,  and  prepare  and  have  its  FY2003 \nfinancial statements independently certified within 6 months of the end of the fiscal year. BPC\u2019s \ncorporate strategy and business plan should be based on the FY2003 financial statements and \ndefine financial, operational (including customer service and O&M), as well as short-, medium-, \nand long-term capital investment performance baselines and targets. \n \n47. \nA  financial  assessment  of  the  Project  was  undertaken. As with many RE projects, the \ncapital investment costs per capita of $1,425 per household are high.  The average incremental \noperating  costs  per  kWh  of  consumption  of  Nu2.57  are  also  high.    However,  the  proposed \nweighted  average  tariff  level  of  Nu0.73  per  kWh  that  will  be  charged  is  low.  Thus,  based  on \nprojected revenues and costs, the net cash flow of the Project and the financial internal rate of \nreturn  is  negative.  The  balance  of  the  financial  costs  will  be  subsidized  thru  cross-subsidies \nfrom HV and MV consumers, and if necessary from income from BPC's transmission activities, \nwhich presently account for over 67% of BPC's total profit margin.  A summary of the financial \nassessment is in Appendix 3. \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\f \n\n13\n\nEconomic Aspects \n\nC. \n \n48. \nThe primary use of electricity by rural residential consumers is for household use. A few \nhouseholds  have  small  stores,  and  some  electricity  is  used  to  operate  equipment  in  small \nworkshops.  The  economic  benefits  of  electricity  consumption  for  these  consumers  are \nevaluated  on  the  basis  of  (i)  the  alternative  economic  costs  of  other  energy  sources  such  as \nkerosene lighting or wood fuel for cooking that will be displaced by using electricity; and (ii) the \nvalue of additional or induced energy consumption at the estimated average willingness to pay \nfor electricity based on a weighted average of the alternative costs of providing  similar energy-\nrelated  services  and  the  current  electricity  tariff.  For  this  Project,  the  average  displaced \nkerosene consumption is about 6.2 liters per house per month, which is equivalent to 2.4 kWh of \nelectricity (in terms of lumens).  Average electricity consumption in rural Bhutan is relatively high \nat 90.5 kWh per month, due to the low average tariff of only Nu0.71/kWh, thus most electricity \nused  is  induced  additional  energy.  The  weighted  average  economic  value  of  residential \nelectricity  consumption  is  estimated  to  be  Nu9.1/kWh  in  this  model12  (or  $0.19/kWh).  This \nincludes  an  average  increase  in  household  income  estimated  to  be  about  Nu78  per  month,  or \nabout 1% of overall average household income13. It also includes improved health standards due \nto a cleaner environment without kerosene lamps, with less cooking over smoky cooking fires in \ncase of houses with electric cooking appliances, and better preservation of food for houses with \nrefrigerators.  Health  benefits  are  estimated  to  be  an  average  of  about  Nu37  per  month  per \nhousehold,  based  on  lower  costs  of  medical  care  required,  and  reduced  number  of  sick  days. \nAppendix 3 provides a more detailed description of the economic evaluation of these benefits. \n \n49. \nBy  2007,  when  the  Project  is  fully  completed,  it  will  serve  an  estimated  8,000  rural \nhouseholds with a population of about 50,000. This number corresponds to an increase of about \n20% in the total number of consumers served by BPC. It represents an 8% increase in the total \nproportion of the national population with electricity supply, from the current 35% to about 43%. \nThe estimated capital cost of the Project is $12.1 million total for distribution at 33 kV and lower, \nincluding  consumer  connection  costs  and  physical  contingencies.  This  corresponds  to  an \naverage  cost  of  $1,425  per  household  served.  The  economic  evaluation  of  the  RE  project  is \nbased on the average unit benefits and capital costs described above,14 average sales of 90.5 \nkWh per month per household, an average cost for bulk power supply of Nu1.38 /kWh based on \nthe  current  tariff  and  opportunity  cost  for  bulk  power  exports  to  India,  less  the  cost  of \ntransmission wheeling for power exports, plus allowances for domestic transmission costs and \ntransmission and distribution losses. Based on these assumptions, the economic internal rate of \nreturn  is  conservatively  estimated  at  12.7%  for  the  base  case.  Data  regarding  other  benefits \nsuch as increased useful hours for leisure or housekeeping in the evenings, improved access to \nmodern communications and entertainment facilities such as radio and TV, and a better overall \nquality of life with electricity, is not readily available. Thus, these benefits have not been included.   \n \nA  least-cost  analysis  was  conducted  looking  at  other  alternatives  such  as  dis tributed \n50. \ngeneration  with  local  grid,  individual  diesel  generators  for  each  household,  and  use  of  solar \nphotovoltaic (PV) sets.  The analysis showed grid extension as the least-cost option.  Project risks \nare  outlined  in  paras.  53-55  and  were  considered  in  the  sensitivity  analysis.    The  sensitivity \nanalysis and further details of the economic analysis is in Appendix 3. \n\n                                                 \n12    The model of the consumer demand function for electricity is that recommended in ADB's ERD Technical Note \n\nSeries No. 3, Measuring Willingness to Pay for Electricity, by P. Choynowski, July 2002.  \n\n13   See Phase 1 Study, op cit., Sections 5.1 and 6.2.  Since provision for benefits of this type is already included in \n\nthe basic consumer benefits model, this income is not added again to avoid double counting.  \n\n14   The standard conversion factor was assumed to be 1.0 for trade between Bhutan and India, since the border and \ntrade relations between the two countries are relatively unrestricted. Since most equipment for this Project will be \nsupplied by Indian companies, the border prices will equal local prices for this equipment.   \n\n\f14 \n\nEnvironmental Aspects \n\n \nD. \n \n51. \nThe  project  is  categorized  as  a  \u201cB\u201d  Project  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  environmental \nimpact assessment (EIA). The Project, which includes only distribution lines and pole-mounted \ntransformers,  is  also  subject  to  Bhutan\u2019s  Environmental  Assessment  Act  2000.    An  Initial \nEnvironmental  Examination  (IEE)  was  prepared  (Appendix  14) \nto  provide  adequate \nenvironmental assessment.  Based on the IEE, the following issues were raised and addressed. \n(i) The environmental impacts associated with the Project will not be significant (because it will \nnot change the land use below the distribution lines and the line alignments will, to the extent \npossible, be located along or close to existing roads or tracks).  However, some stretches of the \ndistribution line will pass through forestlands.  Distribution lines that pass through medium and \ndense  forestlands  will  be  minimized.    For  the  most  part,  distribution  lines  will  pass  through \nforestlands with sparse vegetation coverage so that environmental impacts from tree cutting will \nnot  be  significant.    In  any  case,  construction  work  will  be  undertaken  only  after  approval  for \nforest clearance is obtained from Department of Forestry Services (DOF) and land clearing will \nbe limited only to the area granted the clearance. (ii) A stretch of distribution line in Punakha will \nenter  the  buffer  zone  and  multiple-use  zone  of  Jigme  Dorji  National  Park.  However,  it  will  not \ncreate a significant impact because only about 5 km of the line will enter these zones, and these \nareas are mostly agricultural lands and have no  ecological significance. Construction works in \nthese  areas  will  be  undertaken  only  after  DOF  approval  is  obtained.    Further,  during \nconstruction,  there  will  be  ongoing  consultation  with  the  park  management  officers.  (iii)  The \nenvironmental impacts associated with the construction period will be minor.  In most cases the \nconstruction  materials  and  equipment  will  be  manually  transported  from  the  nearest  road. \nBecause  land  clearing  in  locations  with  steep  slope  gradients  may  trigger  erosion  problems, \nplanting grass to provide ground cover will be done simultaneously during the construction work \nor immediately after construction is completed. Adequate ground cover will avoid pole damage \ndue to landslides. All poles will be located with adequate distance from water bodies. (iv) The \noperations  stage  will  not  create  any  environmental  impact.  However,  routine  line  maintenance \ninvolving trimming of bushes or other vegetation under the lines, particularly in the forest areas, \nwill be done in such a way that it will not to affect the forest ecosystem.  Routine maintenance \nfor  the  pole-mounted  transformers  will  generate  only  a  small  amount  of  waste  oil  (about  0.5 \nliters per year based on previous experience), which is reused for lubrication. Further, the waste \noil  will  not  contain  polychlorinated  biphenyls  (PCBs)  as  BPC  only  uses  PCB-free  transformers \nfor  new  construction.  (v)  BPC  will  ensure  that  all  construction  works  under  the  Project  will  be \nundertaken only after the environmental clearance from the National Environment Commission \n(NEC) is obtained \n \n52. \nOverall environmental impacts are deemed to be minor. The Project will not involve the \naccelerated use of scarce resources; neither will it favor the use of scarce resources to satisfy \nshort-term over long-term socioeconomic needs. The project will contribute to more efficient use \nof  resources  by  improving  the  efficiency  of  energy  use  by  rural  households  and  reducing  the \nconsumption  of  fuelwood  and  air-polluting  kerosene.  The  IEE  also  found  that  the  project  will \nhave negligible effects on the ecology of the Project area and will have a significantly positive \noverall  effect  on  the  socioeconomic  well-being  of  the  rural  population  that  are  beneficiaries  of \nthe  Project.    An  environmental  management  and  monitoring  plan  has  been  prepared.    During \nconstruction,  regular  inspections  will  be  conducted,  particularly  during  the  rainy  season,  to \nensure that contractors are complying with all clauses in the contract documentation specifying \nmitigation measures and mechanisms for environmental protection (revegetation and provision \nof adequate ground cover). On these basis, an EIA is not necessary. \n \n\n\f15 \n\n1.   \n\nRisks \n\nTechnical and Institutional \n\nE. \n \n \n \n53.     Technical  risks  are  minimal  during  Project  implementation  given  that  BPC  (and \npreviously DOP) has already successfully implemented two ADB-financed RE loans. In addition, \nBPC has worked closely with the TA consultants to prepare the technical design, procurement \npackages,  bidding  documents,  and  project  implementation  schedule.    Also,  implementation \nconsultants  will  assist  BPC  on  procurement.    However,  given  BPC's  limited  capacity  and \nexperience to date as a corporate organization, there are institutional risks in terms of effective \nand  efficient  operational  management  and  sustainability  of  project  assets.  BPC  is  only  a  year \nold  and  has  yet  to  fully  encompass  its  overall  responsibilities  to  ensure  efficient  customer \nservice,  service  delivery,  and  O&M  of  assets.  To  address  this,  BPC  will  prepare  an  overall \ncorporate strategy and business plan that includes an appropriate O&M policy and action plan, \nan  asset  replacement  policy  and  action  plan,  strategy,  justified  budgets  and  appropriately \ndefined performance indicators for both, for submission to ADB for review within 12 months of \nloan effectiveness. \n \n \n \nCost  estimates  show  the  Project  to  be  economically  feasible.    Financially,  there  are \n54. \nsignificant cross-subsidies in the sector.  To ensure that these cross-subsidies are well targeted, \nBEA will develop a strategy and time-bound action plan to rationalize and target cross-subsidies \nto  ensure  their  financial  sustainability.    Rationalizing  and  properly  targeting  the  cross-subsidy \nwill ensure the most efficient use of the Government\u2019s resources to support national social and \neconomic  development  goals.    Further,  BEA  will  review  BPC\u2019s  weighted  average  tariff  earned \nand its tariff structure to define a reasonable rate of return for BPC.  Defining a reasonable rate \nof  return  on  assets  or  equity  will  be  critical  to  ensuring  the  medium-  to  long-term  financial \nsustainability of BPC, and enable it to effectively self-finance service expansion and provide the \nGovernment with a return on its substantial investment in the sector.  \n \n\nFinancial and Economic \n\n2. \n\n3. \n\nSocial and Environmental \n\n \n55. \nThe  main  social  risk  is  to  ensure  that  the  Project  actually  serves  its  intended \nbeneficiaries, its design has included a socioeconomic impact evaluation of RE in Bhutan.  The \nresults serve as the basis for selecting districts and subdistricts for electrification to ensure that \nthe  intended  beneficiaries  are  reached.    With  regard  to  environmental  issues,  the  Project  will \nenter only the periphery, i.e. multipurpose use and buffer zones of protected areas and will not \nbe implemented in their core zones.  To minimize the environmental risk, an IEE was conducted \nto  ensure  that  there  are  no  negative  environmental  impacts  in  sensitive  areas.    Substantive \npublic consultations were carried out during the preparation of the Project and the IEE, including \nfocus  group  discussions  and  individual  interviews  at  the  household,  village,  subdistrict  and \ndistrict levels by ADB and the PPTA consultants. \n \n\nVI. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nA. \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  and  BPC  have  given  the \n\n56. \nfollowing assurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n\n\f16 \n\n \n\n \n\n1. \n\nInstitutional reforms \n\n57.  With  regard  to  the  ongoing  dialogue  between  the  Government  and  ADB  on  sector \nrestructuring: \n \n\n(i) \n\nAt  the  latest  by  31  December  2003,  the  Government  will  have  appointed  a  full-\ntime Managing Director for BPC.  \n\n \n(ii)  Within  6  months  of  the  end  of  the  TA  for  capacity  building  of  BEA,  BEA  will \noperate  as a  fully  independent  sector  regulator,  in  accordance  with  the  findings \nand  recommendations  of  the  said  TA,  as  agreed  upon  by  the  Government  and \nADB. \n\n \n(iii) \n\nDHPC  will  be  established,  if  feasible,  in  accordance  with  the  findings, \nrecommendations and time-schedule of the ADTA for the establishment of DPHC \nas agreed between the Government and ADB.  \n\n2. \n\nTechnical Matters \n\n \n58.  With regard to technical matters: \n \n\n3. \n\nFinancial Matters \n\n59.  With regard to financial matters: \n\n(iv) \n\nBPC  shall  take  measures  to  ensure  that  its  overall  system  losses,  with  the \nexpansion of the RE network, does not exceed 13%. \n\n \n(v)  Within one year after the completion of the end of the TA for capacity building for \nBEA, BEA will review and assess the BPC\u2019s weighted average tariff earned and \nits  tariff  structure  to  (a)  define  a  reasonable  rate  of  return  for  BPC;  and  (b) \nprepare  and  approve  a  strategy  and  time-bound  action  plan  to  rationalize  and \ntarget the cross subsidies (between customer classifications) to ensure they are \nappropriately justified and targeted. \n\n \n(vi)  Within  one  year  of  loan  effectiveness,  BPC  will  prepare  an  O&M  and  asset \nreplacement strategy, action plan, and budget that include appropriately defined \nperformance indicators. \n\nAs  of  FY2005,  BPC  will  maintain  at  all  times  during  project  implementation  at \nleast  the  following  financial  performance  targets:  (a)  a  debt  service  ratio  of  1.5; \n(b) a debt equity ratio of 60:40; and (c) a self-financing ratio of 20%, based on the \nmoving  three  year  average  of  the  previous  year\u2019s,  the  ongoing  year\u2019s,  and  the \nnext year\u2019s capital expenditures. BPC\u2019s annually updated corporate development \nplan will include measures to achieve these targets. \n\n \n(vii) \n\n \n4. \n\n \n\nSocial Matters \n\n \n60.  With regard to social matters: \n\n\f17 \n\n(viii)  No Project-related activities will entail land acquisition or voluntary land donations \nand all distribution transformers to be constructed under the Project will be pole-\nmounted. To the extent possible, all distribution transformers will be constructed \non  government  land  free  of  encumbrances.  In  the  event  that  involuntary \nresettlement is unavoidable, it will be done in accordance with ADBs policy and \nGuidelines  on  Involuntary  Resettlement  and  the  Government  will  submit \nresettlement  plans  to  ADB  for  review  and  approval.  No  civil  works  for  that \nparticular  distribution  transformer  will  commence  until  such  approval  has  been \nreceived. \n\nTo the extent possible, all angle and distribution poles (a) will be placed close to \nbunds,  leaving  adequate  space  for  house  expansion;  (b)  will  not  in  any  way \nobstruct either public or private access; and (c) will not be placed on lands that \nbelong to households either owning or occupying less than one acre of land.  \n\nVulnerable  households,  determined  in  accordance  with  criteria  agreed  upon  by \nBPC and ADB will receive free electrification kits, six months after electrification. \n\nBPC  and  private  civil  works  contractors  will  comply  with  all  applicable  labor \nlegislation.  Contract  documents  will  include  a  clause  on  the  prohibition  of  child \nlabor,  as  defined  in  national  legislation,  for  construction  and  maintenance \nactivities  as  well  as  a  clause  regarding  the  respect  of  equal  pay  for  men  and \nwomen for work of equal value.   \n\n \n(ix) \n\n \n(x) \n\n \n(xi) \n\n \n5.  \n\nEnvironmental issues \n\n61.  With regard to environmental issues: \n \n\n(xii) \n\nBPC  will  ensure  that  all  mitigation  measures  states  in  the  IEE  report  will  be \nproperly implemented and monitored during project implementation. \n\n \n(xiii)  BPC  will  obtain  the  Environment  Clearance  from  the  National  Environment \n\nCommission prior to commencing any construction. \n\n \n\n \nB. \n\n6. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring System (PPMS) \n\n62.  With regard to social and benefits monitoring: \n \n\n(xiv)  At the latest 6 months prior to the first electrification, BPC, will establish a PPMS \nincluding  monitoring  on  social  and  poverty  benefits.    Annual  reports  will  be \nforwarded to ADB. \n\nConditions for Loan Effectiveness \n\nThe  following  condition  will  be  met  by  the  Government  before  the  loan  becomes \n63. \neffective:  a  subsidiary  loan  agreement,  satisfactory  to  the  ADB,  between  the  Government  and \nBPC  will  have  been  duly  delivered,  and  executed  and  become  effective  (subject  to  the \neffectiveness of the loan agreement). \n \n\n\f18 \n\nVII. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n64. \nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  loan  would  comply  with  the  Articles  of  Agreement  of \nADB  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to \nSpecial  Drawing  Rights  6,755,000  to  the  Kingdom  of  Bhutan  for  the  Rural  Electrification  and \nNetwork Expansion Project from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources with an interest charge at the \nrate  of  1%  per  annum  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5%  per  annum  thereafter;

Per \n1. \ncapita energy consumption including noncommercial energy amounts to approximately 0.8 ton \nof oil equivalent (toe), compared with 0.027 toe in Nepal, 0.73 toe in India and 0.75 toe in the \nPhilippines. Fuelwood accounts for more than 75% of total energy consumption and virtually all \nnoncommercial  energy  consumption  in  rural  areas.      Since  Bhutan  has  no  known  reserves  of \nfossil  energy  resources,  all  petroleum  products  are  imported  and  distributed  by  two  private \ncompanies,  Bhutan  Oil  Distribution  Company  and  Druk  Petroleum  Company.    The  general \ndemand  for  petroleum  products  has  been  increasing.    The  Ministry  of  Trade  and  Industry \nregulates the price and supply of petroleum products aligned with Indian domestic prices. Import \ndetails of petroleum products from 1999 to 2002 are in Table A2.1.   \n \n\nTable A2.1: Import of Petroleum Products 1999-2002 \n \n1999\n11,851 \n31,830 \n5,084 \n3,286 \n\nProduct \nKerosene (kiloliters) \nDiesel (kiloliters) \nPetrol (kiloliters) \nLPG (metric tons) \n\n2001\n9,100 \n39,468 \n7,830 \n3,614 \n\n2000\n9,153 \n36,844 \n6,521 \n3,546 \n\n2002 \n9,001 \n43,507 \n9,112 \n3,887 \n\n \n\n \n\nSource:  Government of Bhutan, Ministry of Trade and Industry. \nLPG = liquefied petroleum gas \n \n\n \nThe Power Sector \n\n \nB. \n \n2. \nMost of Bhutan\u2019s power comes from run-of-the-river hydropower from four major rivers. \nCurrently,  Bhutan  has  26  run-of-the-river  hydropower  stations  with  a  total  installed  capacity  of \nabout 445 megawatts (MW) with a maximum demand of 96 MW.  There are currently three main \ngenerating  companies:    Chhukha  Hydropower  Corporation  (CHPC  336  MW,  funded  by  India), \nKurichhu Hydropower Corporation (KHPC 60 MW, funded by India) in the eastern region, and \nthe  Baso  Chhu  (Phase  1)  Hydropower  Corporation  (BHPC  24  MW,  funded  by  Austria)  in  the \nwestern  region.  All  three  companies  are  wholly  Government-owned.    Although  the  CHPC, \nKHPC,  BHPC  provide  most  of  the  power  capacity,  there  are  eight  minihydro  plants  with \ncapacities  ranging  from  300  kilowatts  (kW)  to  2,200  kW,  and  15  microhydro  plants  with \ncapacities ranging from 8 kW to 200 kW. The total installed capacity of micro-hydropower plants \nhas reached about 1,000 kW.  The Baso Chhu Phase 2 is expected to be completed in 2004 (40 \nMW,  funded  by  Austria),  and  the  Tala  Hydropower  Project  (1,020  MW,  funded  by  India)  is \nexpected  to  be  completed  by  2005.    The  theoretical  potential  for  hydropower  in  Bhutan  is \n30,000  MW.    The  Department  of  Energy  (DOE)  has  conducted  prefeasibility  and  feasibility \nstudies on projects totaling 16,280 MW.  The Governments of Norway and Japan have funded \nfull-scale  technical  feasibility  studies  for  the  Mangdechhu  Hydropower  Project  (completed  in \n1999  for  360  MW)  and  Punatsangchhu  Hydropower  Project  (completed  in  2001  for  870  MW).  \nThe Government also has plans to establish the Druk Hydropower Corporation (DHPC) to serve \nas the corporate body under which each hydropower station will be managed as an operating \nunit.  ADB has programmed Technical Assistance (TA) for 2003 to assist in establishing DHPC \nand  another  TA  in  2004  to  explore  the  conditions  necessary  for  private  sector  participation  in \nhydropower generation. There are 1,316 solar photovoltaic (PV) panels existing in remote areas \nto  charge  batteries,  particularly  in  schools,  basic  health  units,  and  monasteries.  Because  of \nsufficient  sunshine  in  Bhutan,  solar  PV  panels  have  proven  to  be  a  viable  alternative  to \nproviding grid supply to the most remote areas.  Experiments with wind energy applications for \n\n\f22 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nbattery charging have been undertaken in two districts to determine the sustainability of wind-\nbased generation.  Table A2.2 provides an overview of the power system.   \n \n In FY2001, DOE1 purchased 400 gigawatt-hours (GWh) or 91% of its requirements from \n3. \nCHPC  directly  to  the  transmission  network  at  the  price  of  Nu0.30  per  kilowatt-hour  (kWh).  In \naddition, 10 GWh was purchased from CHPC through the Indian grid system with the wheeling \ncharge of Nu0.05 per kWh for eastern Bhutan. KHPC, BHPC, mini and micro-hydropower plants \nas well as diesel generators through their dedicated isolated networks supplied the balance of \nthe country\u2019s electricity.  Table A2.3 provides Bhutan\u2019s power generation sources. \n \n4. \nThe  current  transmission  and  distribution  system  in  Bhutan  comprises:  (i)  the  western \ngrid  system  supplying  electricity  to  the  western  part  of  Bhutan  including  Thimphu,  fed  from \nCHPC and other small power plants, and connected to the 220 kV Indian grid system for power \nexport from  CHPC; (ii) easterm transmission grid network supplied from KHPC and integrated \nwith    the  Indian  grid system;  (iii)  Daifam  in  Sandrup  Jongkhar  is  supplied  by  the  Assam  State \nElectricity  Board;  (iv)  Sipsoo  in  Samtse  by  the  West  Bengal  State  Electricity  Board;  and  (iii) \nisolated  local  distribution  networks  served  by  mini/micro-hydropower  plants  such  as  the \nBumthang  and  Trongsa  electric  supply  units.      Table  A2.4  provides  an  overview  of  the \ntransmission system \n\n \n\n                                                 \n1 DOP served as the government planning agency as well as the utility agency until the utility functions were \n  corporatized in to BPC on 1 July 2002. \n\n\fAppendix 2 \n\n23 \n\nTable A2.2: Overall Progress of Power System and Performance 1992\u20132002 \n

\nECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL ANALYSES \n\n1. \n\nEconomic Analysis \n\nEconomic Benefits of Electricity Consumption \n\n \nA. \n \n \n \n1. \nElectricity  sold  for  rural  electrification  is  used  primarily  by  residential  consumers  for \nhousehold use.  A few households with small stores, use some electricity to operate equipment in \nsmall  workshops.  The  economic  benefits  of  electricity  consumption  for  these  consumers  are \nevaluated by valuing: (i) the alternative economic costs of other energy sources such as kerosene \nfor  lighting  or  wood  fuel  for  cooking,  that  will  be  displaced  by  using  electricity;  and  (ii)  the \nadditional  or  induced  energy  consumption  at  the  estimated  average  willingness  to  pay  for \nelectricity,  based  on  a  weighted  average  of  the  alternative  costs  of  providing  similar  energy-\nrelated services and the current electricity tariff. \n \nFor this Project, the displaced kerosene consumption is about 6.2 liters/house/month on \n2. \naverage,  which  is  equivalent  to  2.4  kilowatt-hours  (kWh)  of  electricity.  Average  electricity \nconsumption in rural Bhutan is relatively high at 90.5 kWh/month, due to the low average tariff of \nonly Nu0.7 kWh; thus most electricity used is induced additional energy. The weighted average \neconomic  value  of  residential  electricity  consumption  is  estimated  to  be  Nu9.0/kWh  in  this \nmodel1.  A  further  refinement  was  made  to  consider  alternative  cooking  costs.  In  accordance \nwith  the  findings  of  the  Technical  Assistance  (TA\u2019s  Phase  1  Socioeconomic  Impact  of  Rural \nElectrification  Report2  (the  Phase  1  survey),  about  12%  of  total  electricity  consumption  in  rural \nareas  in  Bhutan  is  used  for  cooking3,  and  the  average  value  of  such  use  is  estimated  to  be \nabout Nu5.0/kWh, based on alternative costs of firewood and an allowance for the convenience \nof electric cooking. This reduced the weighted  average  value of electricity use for  lighting and \ncooking only slightly. \n \n3. \nThe Phase 1 survey also found that the supply of electricity generated additional income in \nrural communities  through numerous means: (i)  established  small-scale  cottage and handicrafts \nindustries such as cloth weaving were because people could work longer hours in the evening, or \nbe  more  productive  with good lighting and some electrical equipment were set  up; (ii) mini-food \nprocessing  industries  that  used  electric  machinery  or  refrigeration;  (iii)  trades  such  as  carpentry \nand tailoring became more efficient; and (iv) small shops and bars/restaurants with good lighting, \nrefrigeration,  and  sometimes  TV  as  an  added  attraction  were  opened.  The  average  increase  in \nhousehold  income  was  estimated  to  be  about  Nu78/month,  which  is  about  1%  of  the  overall \naverage household income4. Health standards also improved as a result of electricity supply, due \na  cleaner  environment  without  kerosene  lamps,  with  less  cooking  over  smoky  cooking  fires \nhouses  with  electric  cooking  appliances,  and  better  preservation  of  food  in  houses  with \nrefrigerators.  These  health  benefits  are  estimated  to  be  about  Nu37/month  per  household  on \naverage, based on lower costs of medical care required and reduced number of sick days5. The \n \n                                                \n1    The model of the consumer demand function for electricity is that recommended in ADB's ERD Technical Note Series No. 3, \n\n2   \n\nMeasuring Willingness to Pay for Electricity, by P. Choynowski, July 2002.  \n Report on Socio Economic Impact of Rural Electrification, Final Report, April 2003, prepared for ADB by Domdom. A, de Silva, \nH. and Yonten, K under TA 3825-BHU:  Rural Electrification and Network Expansion.  \n\n3    The PPTA\u2019s Phase 1 Socio-Economic Impact of Rural Electrification Report included extensive surveys of 3,000 rural households \nin Bhutan (of which 1360 households were already electrified). According to the survey rural consumers use electricity for lighting \nin all houses, and to various extents for radios (29% of houses), television (8%), fans (6%), refrigerators (6%), rice cookers (25%), \nwater boilers (7%), and electric stoves (3%).  \nPhase 1 Study, Sections 5.1 and 6.2.  Since provision for benefits of this type is included in the basic consumer benefits model, \nthis income is not added again to avoid double counting.  \nPhase 1 Study, Section 6.3. \n\n4  \n\n5  \n\n\fAppendix 3 \n\n27 \n\n \n\n \n\n2. \n\nRural Electrification Costs and Economic Internal Rate of Return (EIRR) \n\nresulting  total  economic  benefit  of  electricity  use  that  can  be  quantified  is  about  Nu9.0/kWh  (or \n$0.19/kWh).  This  is  significantly  higher  than  the  current  average  tariff  for  rural  electrification  of \nonly Nu0.71/kWh.  Other benefits that cannot be quantified are increased useful hours for leisure \nor housekeeping in the evenings, improved access to modern communications and entertainment \nfacilities such as radio and TV, and a better overall quality of life with electricity.  \n \n \n \nBy  2007  when  the  Project  is  fully  completed,  it  will  serve  an  estimated  8,000  rural \n4. \nhouseholds  with  a  population  of  about  50,000.  This  figure  will  correspond  to  an  increase  of \nabout 20% in the total number of consumers served by BPC and will result in an 8% increase in \nthe total proportion of the national population with electricity supply, from the current rate of 35% \nto about 43%. The estimated capital cost of the Project is $12.1 million total for distribution at 33 \nkV  and  lower,  including  consumer  connection  costs  and  physical  contingencies.  This \ncorresponds to an average cost of $1,425 per household served.  The economic evaluation of \nthe rural electrification project is based on the average unit benefits and capital costs (para. 3)6, \naverage  sales  of  90.5  kWh/month/household,  an  average  cost  for  bulk  power  supply  of \nNu1.38/kWh based on the current tariff and opportunity cost for bulk power exports to India, less \nthe cost of transmission wheeling for power exports, plus allowances for domestic transmission \ncosts  and  transmission  and  distribution  losses.  The  calculations  (Table  A3.1)  result  in  an \nestimated  economic  internal  rate  of  return  (EIRR)  of  12.7%  for  the  base  case.  Sensitivity \nanalysis was conducted for the scenarios described in Table A3.2. \n\nTable A3.2:  Sensitivity Analysis \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \nSIa \n\n \n EIRR (%) \n\n12.7 \n  9.6 \n10.8 \n12.1 \n11.3 \n\n\u2013 \n0.16 \n0.19 \n0.12 \n0.01 \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \na Sensitivity Index (SI) is the ratio of % change in the EIRR to the % change in the given parameter. \n\n \nSensitivity Scenario \n \nBase Case \nAverage Sales per House Reduced by 20% \nUnit Benefits Reduced by 10% \nAverage Capital Costs Increased by 5% \nAverage Asset Maintenance Costs Increased by 100% \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 5. \nThe Project is sensitive to all the variables in Table A3.2 except the last. Since the Project \ncomprises many independent subprojects in the various districts of Bhutan, it is more appropriate \nto regard the results of the sensitivity analysis as establishing the minimum requirements for the \neconomic feasibility of the various subprojects planned. In project planning, there is no reason to \nexpect  significant  differences  on  a  regional  basis  in  estimated  average  sales  per  household  or \naverage  unit  benefits.  However,  the  average  cost  per  household  will  vary,  and  the  maximum \neconomically  affordable  average  cost  of  distribution  will  be  $1,7907  per  house  for  a  subproject. \nThe  TA  has  prepared  the  distribution  designs  and  estimated  the  costs  on  a  district  basis.

Alternative  sources  of  power  supply  were \nalso  reviewed  briefly,  but  are  estimated  to  be  more  costly  (i)  The  most  practical  alternative \nwould  be  small  captive  diesel  generating  sets  for  rural  households,  which  would  have  an \naverage  cost  of  about  $0.31/kWh.  Details  of  this  calculation  are  shown  in  Supplementary \nAppendix  H.  This  is  much  more  costly  than  the  average  cost  of  power  supply  through  an \nextension of the distribution grid.  Grid extensions in Bhutan would be more costly than diesel \nwhen the average cost of a grid extension exceeds $2,750 per household (the switching value). \nHowever,  at  this  cost  level  neither  option  would  be  considered  economically  viable  since  for \nboth the average costs would exceed the average economic benefits of supply to consumers.  \n(ii)  A  few  demonstration  projects  for  household  solar  photovoltaic  (PV)  systems  in  rural  areas \nhave also been developed in Bhutan (1,300 units in total).  While these PV systems were given \nfree,  their  maintenance  and  sustainability  continue  to  be  problematic  to  date.  Average  capital \ncosts  are  about  $800  for  a  basic  low-capacity  household  system  (3  compact  florescent  lamps \nlights of 15 watts each), and the average economic cost of electricity used are about $1.80/kWh.  \nWhile this may be considered for minimum lighting requirements in remote rural areas, it is too \ncostly for larger scale applications. (iii) A few off-grid minihydro projects of less than 1000 kW \nhave  also  been  developed  in  Bhutan,  and  have  been  studied  and  proposed  for  external \nfinancing on a grant basis.  However, they are relatively costly, with an average cost of about \n$5,000 per household served for power plant capacity and associated distribution. This is much \nmore  costly  than  extension  of  the  integrated  distribution  grid  as  planned  under  the  Project.  \nFurthermore, good off-grid minihydro projects are only available in a few locations. \n \nB. \n \nThe  Bhutan  Power  Corporation  (BPC)  was  established  in  July  2002.  It  has  two  main \n7. \nprofit  activities:  transmission  and  distribution  of  electricity.  BPC  will  produce  its  first  financial \nstatement  (for  a  reporting  period  of  18  months)  on  31  December  2003.  Based  on  indicative \nestimates by BPC, the contribution of each main activity to BPC\u2019s profit is summarized in Table \nA3.4.    Domestic  sales  account  for  approximately  70%  of  BPC\u2019s  total  revenue  and  contribute \nover 55% to its operating margin. With depreciation assumed at 3% debt and financing charges, \ndomestic sales contribute Nu44 million, which together with the contribution of Nu87 million to \nprofit by transmission activities, results in a total contribution to BPC\u2019s profit before tax of Nu131 \nmillion. \n\nFinancial Analysis \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n29 \n\nTable A3.4:  BPC Annual Profit Contribution by Main Activity \n(assuming depreciationa at 3%, as of July 2003) \n\n \n \nTotal KWh Handled (million) \nWeighted Average Tariff per KWh \nTotal Revenue (Nu million) \nCost of Sales \n- Generationb \n- Transmissionc \n- Distributiond \n- Physical Lossese \nOperating Margin \n- Depreciationf \n- Bad Debtg \n- Financing Chargesh \nContribution to Profit \n\nBPC \n \n2,400 \n \n759 \n446 \n208 \n115 \n105 \n18 \n313 \n132 \n10 \n40 \n131 \n\nTransmission \n \n1,800 \n0.125 \n225 \n86 \n0 \n86 \n0 \n0 \n139 \n52 \n0 \n0 \n87 \n\nDistribution \n \n600 \n0.89i \n534 \n360 \n208 \n29 \n105 \n18 \n174 \n80 \n10 \n40 \n44 \n\nSource: BPC estimates. \nBPC =  Bhutan Power Corporation, kWh = kilowatt-hours. \na \nDepreciation assumes economic life of 30 years. \nCost of generation assumes bulk sale price of Nu0.346 per kWh. \n\nb \nc   Cost of transmission including operations and maintenance (O&M)and overhead expenses has been estimated \n\nat 5% of optimized replacement value of transmission assets (estimated at Nu2.3 billion). \n\ne \n\nf  \n\nd   Cost  of  distribution  including  O&M  and  overhead  expenses  has  been  estimated  at  5%  of  the  optimized \nreplacement  value  of  distribution  assets  (including  generation  assets  and  other  assets,  estimated  at  Nu2.1 \nbillion). \nTechnical losses are estimated only for domestic  sales, and assume a  weighted average of 7.8% (LV at 25%, \nMV at 8%, HV at 2%). \nDepreciation  is  estimated  using  a  proxy  of  5%  of  the  optimized  replacement  value  of  total  assets  in  general \naccordance  with  corporate  tax  requirements  (5%  for  generation,  transmission,  and  distribution  assets,  3%  for \nbuilding and 15% for other assets). \nBad debt is estimated at 2% of total domestic sales. \nFinancing charges are estimated at 6% of two existing ADB loans of Nu670 million. \n\nh \ni   Weighted  average  tariff  assumes  20%  kWh  sales  to  LV  consumers  (of  which  25%  sales  to  rural  households \n(average HH consumption per month = 142 kWh) and 75% sales to urban households (average HH consumption \nper month = 289 kWh)), 20% kWh sales to MV consumers, and 60% kWh sales to HV consumers. \n\ng \n\n \n\n8. \nAn assessment of the cost recovery level of BPC\u2019s existing weighted average tariff and \nthe degree to which the tariff structure supports cross-subsidies is summarized in Table A3.5.  \nThis  assessment  assumes  a  break-even  situation,  i.e.,  equity  has  been  provided  on  a  grant \nbasis  (with  no  return  on  equity  required),  and  a  realistic  depreciation  rate  or  rate  of  asset \nreplacement  (i.e.,  based  on  the  estimated  economic  life  of  the  assets).  Under  these \nassumptions, for every kWh of domestic sales the average weighted contribution to BPC profit \nis  Nu0.074.  For  high  voltage  (HV)  sales,  which  make  up  approximately  60%  of  total  BPC \ndomestic  kWh  sales,  the  contribution  is  Nu0.386/kWh.  For  medium  voltage  (MV)  sales,  which \nmake up approximately 20% of total BPC domestic kWh sales, the contribution is Nu0.133/kWh. \nFor low voltage sales (LV) to rural and urban households, which in total make up the remaining \n20%  of  total  BPC  domestic kWh  sales,  a  cross-subsidy  is  provided  by  HV  and  MV  sales,  i.e., \nNu2.580 for each kWh sold to rural households and Nu0.399/kWh sold to urban households. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\f30 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n \n\nTable A3.5: Cost Recovery Level of BPC\u2019s Tariff Structure, as of July 2003 \n\nItem \n\n  LV - Rural \n\n  LV - Urban \n\n   MV \n\n   HV \n\nTotal KWh Sold (million) \nWeighted Average Tariff (Nu) \nTotal Revenue (Nu million) \nCost per KWh sold (Nu) \n\nGeneration \nTransmissiona \nDistributionb \nPhysical Losses \n\nOperating Margin (Nu) \n\n    BPC \n600 \n0.89 \n534 \n0.598 \n0.346 \n0.048 \n0.175 \n0.029 \n0.292 \n0.029 \n0.105 \n0.017 \n0.067 \n0.074 \n\n30 \n0.73 \n22 \n2.189 \n0.346 \n0.048 \n1.680 \n0.115 \n(1.459) \n0.029 \n1.008 \n0.017 \n0.067 \n(2.580) \n\n90 \n0.82 \n74 \n0.882 \n0.346 \n0.048 \n0.373 \n0.115 \n(0.062) \n0.029 \n0.224 \n0.017 \n0.067 \n(0.399) \n\n120 \n0.95 \n114 \n0.599 \n0.346 \n0.048 \n0.175 \n0.030 \n0.351 \n0.029 \n0.105 \n0.017 \n0.067 \n0.133 \n\n360 \n0.90 \n324 \n0.401 \n0.346 \n0.048 \n \n0.007 \n0.499 \n0.029 \n \n0.017 \n0.067 \n0.386 \n\nDepreciation \u2013Transmissionc \nDepreciation \u2013 Distributionc \nBad Debt \nFinancing Charges \nContribution to Profit \nSource: BPC estimates. \nBPC =  Bhutan Power Corporation, LV = low voltage, MV = medium voltage, HV = high voltage, kWh = kilowatt-hours \na Transmission costs apportioned across 2,400 kWhs.  \nb Distribution costs apportioned: LV=80% (of which Rural=60%, Urban=40%), MV=20%. \nc Depreciation is estimated assuming a 3% rate of replacement (i.e., in accordance with an estimated economic life of 30 \nyears). \n\n \nBased  on  these  estimates,  BPC\u2019s  domestic  electricity  operation  is  financially  viable  at \n9. \nleast  in  the  short  term.

The consultant \nwill:  (i) assist BPC in evaluating bids and answer post tender queries to finalize contracts with \ngoods  suppliers;  and  (ii)  review  and  technically  approve  designs  submitted  by  the  contracted \nsuppliers and equipment manufacturers, and organize factory inspection and witnessing tests of \nequipment being supplied to the Project; (iii) Assist BPC plan the implementation program and \nmanage  implementation  using  a  project  management  software  package  such  as  Microsoft \nProject; and (iv) Assist in preparing quarterly project reports and the project completion report \nfor  submission  by  BPC  to  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB).  The  consultant  will  prepare  a \nfinal report on the Project to BPC and ADB on completion of the services. \n \n2. \nA  domestic  consulting  firm  with  benefits  monitoring  and  evaluation  experience  will  be \nrecruited  to  assist  BPC.    The  domestic  consultant  will  (i)  review  and  refine  the  existing \nframework for benefit monitoring (included in the social and poverty assessment) based on the \nproject framework and the poverty intervention targets.  The consultant will be guided by ADBs \nProject  Performance  Management  System  (PPMS)  Guidelines  for  Bank  Staff.  The  selected \nsample  for  monitoring  should  ensure  coverage  of  the  different  consumer  categories  and \nhouseholds  based  on  their  social  and  poverty  characteristics;  (ii)  review  BPC\u2019s  management \ninformation  system  (MIS)  and  improve  it  to  ensure  that  project  benefits  related  to  social  and \npoverty benefits can be incorporated into the system. The purpose is to mainstream social and \npoverty  benefit  monitoring  within  the  PPMS  system;  (iii)  use  the  baseline  data  from  the \nSocioeconomic  Impact  of  Rural  Electrification  (Phase  1)  Survey  2003  and  collect  additional \nbaseline data for the two districts that were not included in the survey. Indicators for targeting \nwill be based on the social and poverty assessment; (iv) agree with BPC, based on the Phase 1 \nsurvey and the social and poverty analysis, key baseline values for each selected indicator and \nthe  expected  or  target  values  at  specified  monitorable  dates  during  implementation  and  for \nevaluation.  Identify  key  select  performance  indicators  based  on  the  different  consumer \ncategories. Essential indicators are, (a) adequacy of targeting and distribution of free electricity \nkits (b) selection and poverty targeting to meet the required number of beneficiary households, \nand (c) intrahousehold benefits, including poverty, social, and development benefits to different \nconsumers. Gender-disaggregated data will be collected; (v) agree with BPC on the most useful \nform for presenting data and report presentation to enable timely project implementation, impact \nmonitoring  and  establishing  an  appropriate  information  database;  (vi)  submit  the  finalized \nbenefits monitoring framework, through BPC to ADB for review; and (vii) submit annual reports \nto BPC and ADB. \n \n3. \n \n\nThe task of the consultant and the length of service in person-months are in the table. \n\nConsulting Requirements \n \n\nItem of Service \nBid Evaluation and Procurement-related Matters \nDesign Review and Project Management \nPreparation of Project Completion Report \nBenefits Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n \n\nPerson-Months \n2.0 \n2.5 \n0.5 \n6.0 \n\n\f38 \n\nAppendix 10 \n\nADTA FOR CAPACITY BUILDING OF THE BHUTAN ELECTRICITY AUTHORITY \n\n \n1. \nThe  director  of  the  Department  of  Energy  (DOE)  will  have  overall  responsibility  for  the \nTechnical  Assistance  (TA)  while  the  head  of  the  Bhutan  Electricity  Authority  (BEA)  will  be  the \nday-to-day  project  coordinator,  who  will  oversee  the  consultants  and  co-ordination  amongst \nBEA, other DOE units, stakeholders (e.g., BPC, power corporations), the consultants, the Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  and  other  Government  agencies.    Where  necessary,  BEA  will \nestablish working groups to review and comment on the secondary laws, regulations, standards, \nand codes that are drafted.  The TA will begin in November 2003 and will end after 18 months.   \n \n2. \nThe TA will have five components. (i) Conduct a needs assessment of BEA\u2019s institutional \nrequirements.  BEA  is  currently  a  nascent  body  whose  staff  has  little  experience  in  drafting, \nreviewing and implementing its mandate.  Under the TA, the consultants will work closely with \nthe BEA staff and other counterparts to assess the technical and institutional needs, as well as \nneeds of its key stakeholders i.e., BPC and hydro power corporations. (ii) Develop a short- and \nmedium-term  training  program.  Based  on  the  capacity  building  needs  assessment,  the \nconsultant, in close consultation with BEA staff and other counterparts, will develop immediate- \n(1 to 2 years) and medium-term (3 to 5 years) training programs for concerned staff in BEA and \nits stakeholders. Including of BEA\u2019s stakeholders is important and necessary to ensure that the \nbodies  that  BEA  is  regulating  also  understand  the  regulatory  process.;  (iii)  Assist  BEA  in \ndeveloping  the  national  standards  and  codes  for  the  sector.  The  training  programs  outlined  in \ncomponent  2  will  provide  BEA  and  its  stakeholders  with  draft  national  codes  and  standards.  \nBecause of Bhutan\u2019s close proximity to India, most of the plant and materials come from there, \nand India is the market for Bhutan\u2019s power, the consultants will refer mainly to Indian standards, \nin addition to those of the International Electrical Commission.  Other existing field practices in \nBhutan will also be considered. (iv) Design and implement a national outreach strategy to raise \nconsumer  awareness  of  BEA\u2019s  role.  Because  BEA  is  a  newly  established  body,  power \nconsumers and other stakeholders are not aware of its important role as their advocate.  BEA \nstaff,  under  the  guidance  of  the  consultants,  will  design  an  outreach  strategy  to  introduce \nthemselves to their stakeholders, mainly electricity consumers, explain their role, and show how \nthey may serve them. (v) Explore the possibility of establishing a combined national regulatory \nbody that would regulate public utilities. Given the small size of the market for various utilities in \nBhutan,  there  may  be  efficiencies  and  economies  of  scale  in  combining  the  various  utility \nregulators,  e.g.,  power,  telecommunications,  cable  television,  and  other  future  regulators  such \nas water, solid waste, etc as they are established, into a single national regulatory body.  The \nProject  will  examine  the  pros  and  cons  of  a  public  utilities  regulatory  body  and  propose  a \nstructure for such a body, including the methodology for the transitioning from several regulators \ninto a single regulator.   \n\n \n3. \nThe total inputs are 10 person-months of international consulting.  ADB will use biodata \nproposals and quality- and cost-based (QCBS) methods for consultant selection, in accordance \nwith  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants.    The  outline  terms  of  reference  for  the \nconsultants can be found in Supplementary Appendix F. \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 11 \n\n39 \n\nADTA FOR ESTABLISHING THE DRUK HYDROPOWER CORPORATION (DHPC) \n\n \n1. \nThe  Department  of  Energy  (DOE)  will  be  the  executing  agency  for  the  technical \nassistance (TA). The director of DOE will have overall responsibility for the TA.  The head of the \nCoordination  Office  of  DOE  will  be  the  national  project  coordinator,  responsible  for  overall \ncoordination  among  the  stakeholders  involved  such  as  Chukhha  Hydropower  Corporation \n(CHPC),  Kurichhu  Hydropower  Corporation  (KHPC),  Baso  Chhu  Hydropower  Corporation \n(BHPC),  the  future  Tala  Hydropower  Corporation  (THPC),  DOE,  BEA,  other  concerned \ngovernment  agencies,  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB),  and  other  concerned  aid  agencies  in \nthe power sector. The Implementing Agency for the TA will be CHPC. Although the consultants \nwill  work  closely  with  DOE  at  the  policy  level,  and  consult  all  the  hydropower  corporations  for \ntheir input, given CHPC\u2019s status as the prime hydropower corporation in Bhutan, with the largest \ngeneration  capacity  and  with  the  most  experienced  management  and  engineering  staff,  the \nconsultants will benefit most by daily close collaboration with CHPC staff.    \n \n2. \nThe TA will have three parts, to be implemented sequentially. (i) Policy and hydropower \nsector  review.  The  consultants  will  review  the  appropriate  Government\u2019s  policies  relating  to \neconomic growth, the power sector in general, specifically hydropower. The consultants should \nalso look closely at the methodology for integration of the hydropower corporations, i.e., should \nall hydropower corporations be integrated at once or should there be a phased approach. The \nconsultants will organize a national consultation workshop to discuss integrating the hydropower \ncorporations,  discuss  the  recommended  options  for  DHPC,  and  reach  an  agreement  on  how \nbest to structure DHPC; (ii) Detailed design of DHPC. Based on the agreements reached at the \nnational consultation workshop, the consultants will design the institutional, technical, financial, \nand  human  resource  details  of  DHPC  and  then  will  organize  a  second  national  consultation \nworkshop to discuss the detailed design and reach final agreement on the structure of DHPC. \n(iii) Final design. The consultants will then make the necessary revisions to the DHPC structure \nfor final submission to the government and ADB and conduct a series of seminars on relevant \ntopics  necessary  to  raise  the  awareness  and  for  technical  training  of  relevant  staff  on  new \nknowledge,  technologies,  processes  or  skills  they  will  need  to  successfully  contribute  to  the \nfunctioning of DHPC.   \n\n \nThe  TA  will  be  carried  out  over  12  months  by  an  international  consulting  firms  or \n3. \ninstitutes. The study will begin in the first quarter of 2004 and end by the first quarter of 2005. \nThis will allow the project Implementing Agency to integrate the TA into their annual work plans. \nThe total input of the consultants will be about 16 person-months, respectively. The consultants \nwill be engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. ADB will use \nthe  simplified  technical  proposal  and  quality-  and  cost-based  selection  methods  for  consultant \nselection.

The \nProject is being prepared under the Ninth Five-Year Plan, and is one of the Rural Electrification \n(RE) projects that will assist the Government reach its goal of 100% electrification by the year \n2020. It will continue the objective of expanding the RE network as set out in the Eighth Five-\nYear  Plan  under  which  the  Sustainable  Rural  Electrification  Project  was  implemented.    The \nProject  comprises  of  250  subprojects  within  20  districts  in  Bhutan.  Of  the  15,000  households \ntargeted  by  the  Project,  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  component  will  cover  8,000 \nhouseholds  in  eight  districts.  The  eight  districts  -  Chhukha,  Lhuenste,  Mongar,  Pemagatshel, \nPunakha,  Samtse,  Sarpang,  and  Trashigang  -  were  selected  on  the  basis  of  economic  and \nfinancial criteria, poverty, and technical feasibility. All regions in the country will be represented. \nTo  electrify  the  balance  of  the  households,  alternative  funding,  possibly  from  Austria  and  the \nNetherlands  will  be  sought.  According  to  the  Government  of  Bhutan,  the  objective  of \nelectrification  is  \u201cpoverty  alleviation,  health  improvement,  education,  income  generation \nopportunities and environment protection.\u201d  \n \nA. \n \nThe most recent estimates, place the population of Bhutan  at about 695,000, of whom \n2. \n80% reside in rural areas.1  About 66,000 of the 85,000 rural households are without electricity. \nFuelwood  is  the  predominant  source  of  energy  for  98%  of  the  households  without  electricity, \nirrespective of their position in relation to the poverty line.2  The annual per capita consumption \nof  fuelwood  is  1.22  tons,  one  of  the  highest  in  the  world.  The  Government  policy  is  to  reduce \nfuelwood consumption by using electricity for lighting as well as for cooking.  The methodology \nused  for  identifying  the  social  and  poverty  benefits  combined  rapid  rural  appraisal  (RRA), \nprimary data based on TA 3825 Phase 1 Survey,3 information from the Household Income and \nExpenditure  Survey  (HIES),4  Poverty  Assessment  and  Analysis  Report  20005  and  the \nComprehensive Food Security Programme6. To represent different regions, the RRA selected 7 \nof the 13 districts in the Phase 1 study. Two villages, one with electricity and one without, were \nselected  from  each  district.  The  Poverty  Assessment  and  Analysis  Report  comments  that  the \nconcept  of  poverty  in  Bhutan7  comprises  several  interlinking  factors  that  include  lack  (or \nshortage)  of  land,  low  agricultural  productivity,  low  income,  food  insecurity,  lack  of  adequate \nphysical  and  social  infrastructure,  and  inability  to  satisfy  basic  needs.  Detailed  household  and \ndemographic  information  is  not  available  because  no  census  has  been  conducted  in  Bhutan. \nThe rural economy is largely a subsistence economy with limited engagement in a cash-based \nmarket economy. Barter plays an important role. The HIES partly revealed the country\u2019s poverty \nsituation. Based on a preliminary pilot survey, an absolute or food poverty line was established \nat  Nu612  per  capita  per  month  and  an  upper  poverty  line  of  Nu749.  Rural  households  falling \nbelow  the  poverty  line  mean  they  cannot  meet  their  basic  food  and  nonfood  requirements.  A \nvulnerability  line  (15%  income  above  the  upper  poverty  line)  is  set  at  Nu860  per  capita  per \n\n                                                 \n1  \nStatistical Yearbook of Bhutan 2001. \n2  \nTA  3825-BHU:  Rural  Electrification  and  Network  Expansion-Phase  1  Socio-Economic  Impact  of  Rural  Electrification,  Final \nReport, April 2003. \nAn  extensive  survey  undertaken  in  3,000  households  (both  electrified  and  nonelectrified)  in  13  districts.

The  HIES  determined  that  severe  poverty  affects  29%  of  the  rural  population.  As  with \nmany  other  economic  indicators  in  Bhutan,  reliable  data  on  income  are  not  readily  available. \nPoverty  assessment  therefore  uses  income  as  only  one  indicator  of  poverty  and  considers \nvulnerability,  which  includes  income  vulnerability  as  well  as  rural  location,  food  insecurity,  and \nlack  of  physical  and  social  infrastructure,  as  being  key  factors  related  to  poverty.    Lhuentse, \nMongar,  and  Pemaghatshel  are  food-insecure  districts.  According  to  the  Poverty  Assessment \nReport,  poverty  is  concentrated  in  the  southeast  with  three  quarters  of  the  poorest  gewogs \n(blocks)  located  in  this  region.  Pemaghatshel,  Mongar,  and  Trashigang  are  located  in  this \nregion.    According  to  the  Poverty  Assessment  Report,  Samtse,  Chhukha,  Punakha,  and \nSarpang are vulnerable districts.  \n \n3. \nTable  A12.1  shows  that  almost  69%  of  households  fall  into  the  category  of  vulnerable \nand 23% are below the upper poverty line. Except for Lhuentse and Pemaghatshel, six districts \ntargeted  by  the  ADB  component  are  in  the  Table.  Lhuentse  and  Pemaghatshel  are  food-\ninsecure districts and are well within the vulnerable category. \n\n \n\nTable A12.1: Poverty Data of Beneficiaries \n\nDistrict \n\nBumthang \nChukkha \nHaa \nMongar \nParo \nPunakha \nSamtse \nSarpang \nThimpu \nTrashigang \nTrongsa \nTsirang \nZhemgang \nAverage \n\nLower Poverty Line \n(Nu612/ capita/month)\n\nVulnerability Line \n(Nu860/capita/month) \n\nNonelectrified Households Below Poverty Lines (%) \nHigher Poverty Line \n(Nu748/capita/month)\n30.4 \n18.1 \n9.1 \n16.7 \n8.6 \n61.8 \n20.0 \n15.0 \n63.6 \n10.9 \n65.1 \n7.0 \n61.9 \n23.3 \n\n21.7 \n10.8 \n9.1 \n9.0 \n4.3 \n49.6 \n16.9 \n10.0 \n54.5 \n9.1 \n61.9 \n4.0 \n54.8 \n17.8 \n\n41.3 \n24.6 \n9.1 \n20.1 \n10.0 \n64.2 \n26.3 \n16.3 \n63.6 \n15.1 \n68.3 \n9.0 \n69.0 \n27.7 \n\n   Source: TA 3825 - Phase 1 Survey, May 2003. \n\n \n4. \nFood-deficit  households  generally  lack  grain  1.2-3.0  months  per  year.  Households  in \nblocks  where  it  takes  more  than  7  hours  to  walk  to  a  motorable  road  are  among  the  poorest. \nTrashigang,  Pemaghatshel,  and  Mongar  fall  within  this  group.

Expenditure on kerosene (primary source of fuel for lighting), batteries, and \ncandles  decreases  with  household  connection.  Households  with  electricity  still  spend  a  high \nproportion  of  their  monthly  expenditure  on  alternative  fuel  sources,  which  leads  to  the \nconclusion  that  households  use  electricity  primarily  for  lighting  and  fuelwood  and  liquefied \npetroleum  gas  for  cooking.  For  nonelectrified  households,  poor  and  non-poor,  the  highest \nenergy  expenditure  was  for  kerosene.  Although  firewood  is  used  extensively  by  rural \nhouseholds (91%), it is collected and no cash expenditure is involved. Households disliked the \nextensive  smoke  caused  by  kerosene.  The  risk  of  fire  and  indoor  smoke  pollution  were  also \nraised  as  an  adverse  effect  of  kerosene  use.    For  households  falling  below  the  poverty  line, \nsome  52%  use  less  than  80  kilowatt  hours  (kWh)  per  month  (the  lowest  tariff  block).  The \naverage  use  is  51  kWh  per  month  and  average  monthly  expenditure  is  Nu30.  The  minimum \ncharge by Bhutan Power Corporation (BPC) is Nu35.  The Phase 1 Survey found that, excluding \nelectricity,  the  minimum  average  monthly  expenditure  a  household  could  expect  to  spend  on \nfuel is Nu219, while the higher is in the order of Nu581. The average monthly expenditure for all \nhouseholds  regardless  of  poverty  status  and  use  of  electricity  is  Nu388.  Without  electricity,  5 \nliters  kerosene  used  for  lighting  by  low-income  households  costs  about  Nu60  a  month,  while \nmonthly  electricity  bills  are  only  half  this  amount.    The  Phase  1  Survey  also  found  that  for \ncooking,  households  preferred  fuelwood  for  cooking  because  they  said  it  makes  food  taste \nbetter. While households are buying rice cookers, it will take time for practice to change. Rice \ncookers are exempt from import duties to encourage consumers to purchase them. The  HIES \nshows  that  poor  rural  households  (income  less  than  Nu612  per  month)  spend  25%  of  their \nincome on fuel, light, and water. Non-poor rural households spend about 18%. According to the \nPhase  1  Survey,  despite  frequent  power  failures  and  load  fluctuations,  more  than  60%  of \nhouseholds,  whether  poor  or  non-poor,  indicated  they  had  sufficient  income  to  pay  for  tariff \nincreases. The approximate connection cost to the householder is Nu3,165. While households \ncan afford to pay the monthly charges, some will face difficulty in meeting the up-front charges \nfor the initial connection. Under the Sustainable Rural Electrification Project, BPC distributed to \npoor consumers 600 free electricity kits, each worth Nu5,000. BPC recommends the following \ncriteria  for  selecting  households  to  receive  free  kits  under  the  Project:  (i)  two  rooms  including \nkitchen;  (ii)  type  of  house  construction:  single-storey  mud  house,  stone  house  with  wood \nroofing;  (iii)  wait  for  willing  households  to  connect  and  after  6  months  of  project  completion \ndetermine  which  households  did  not  connect  due  to  cost;  and  (iv)  vulnerable  households, \nhousehold  with  female  heads,  households  with  no  land  and  households  without  cash  income.  \nApproximately  3,450  kits  will  be  distributed  at  a  total  cost  of  $134,550.  BPC  is  also \nrecommending that an additional 20 ampere earth leakage circuit breaker be included with the \nkit.  One  circuit  breaker  costs  Nu700.  The  Bhutan  Development  Finance  Corporation  (BDFC) \nalready has an ongoing microcredit program in rural areas. Under this scheme, households can \nborrow for connections and internal wiring. In addition to the households, the Project will provide \nelectricity to local towns, for businesses, basic health units, schools, and monastic institutions.   \n \nC. \n\nSocial and Poverty Impact \n\n8. \nThe main findings of the Phase 1 Survey were that electrification (i) encouraged home-\nbased  businesses  (ii)  gave  education  benefits,  with  school-age  children  spending  more  time \nstudying; for poor and non-poor households, adult literacy was higher in areas with electricity;  \n(iii)  improved  the  health  status  of  adults  in  households  below  and  above  the  poverty  line;  and \n(iv)  improved  peoples  sense  of  well-being  and  security,  including  protecting  crops  from \n\n\f44\n\n \n\nAppendix 12 \n\ndestruction by wild animals. The RRA confirmed similar perceptions; the view was that \u201cit would \nmake people\u2019s living easier\u2026.\u201d The Phase 1 Survey demonstrated benefits derived from using \nelectricity in home business activity and concluded that, for households above the poverty line, \nelectricity  had  the  potential  to  increase  incomes  by  Nu126  per  month.  A  poor  previously \nnonelectrified household could save as much as Nu872 per month if it shifted from kerosene to \nelectricity.  Electricity can reduce a household\u2019s vulnerability in many ways, most demonstrably \nthrough  the  opportunities  to  diversify  household  income  and  through  improved  food  security. \nLack of irrigation was cited as a constraint on productivity by high numbers of rural households. \nInterestingly, the RRA data indicate that wild animals followed by lack of irrigation was among \nthe  most  serious  constraints  felt  by  farming  households.  Lighting  was  seen  as  an  important \nbenefit for children\u2019s education as well as a mechanism for curbing an increasing tendency for \nmigration to urban areas. The Phase 1 Survey, focus group discussions, and the RRA indicate \nthat  the  following  home  business  opportunities  are  available:  mini-  food  processing  business \nsuch as grinding of chillies and flattening maize, handicrafts, particularly weaving. Women said \nthat, with electricity, their weaving output could be increased to 3 athras (a type of indigenous \nwool fabric that central Bhutan is renowned for producing) from the present 1.5 pieces a week. \nThe  current  labor  charge  for  one  piece  is  Nu160.  Other  activities  include  carpentry,  carving, \ntailoring  -  all  of  which  could  be  done  after  dark.  Electricity  was  also  perceived  as  in  important \nbenefit for households that did not own land. The Phase 1 Survey indicated that about 10% of \nhouseholds  opened  small  businesses,  mostly  bars  and  restaurants,  followed  by  weaving  or \nhandicrafts.  Lighting  and  electrification  of  local  towns  will  stimulate  local  economic  growth, \nhealth centers will be able to access refrigeration, and health care provision can be expected to \nimprove  if  vaccines  are  stored  locally.  The  Phase  1  Survey  concluded  that  health  benefits  of \nNu50/month  accrued  to  households  with  electrification,  if  they  had  access  to  health  care \nfacilities.  Electricity  also  provided  a  demand  for  electricians  and  repair  services.  The  National \nTechnical  Training  Authority  (NTTA)  has  begun  to  offer  training  courses  for  electricians  in \nkeeping  with  the  goal  of  100%  electrification.  During  construction,  unskilled  labor  will  be \ninvolved. The distributional analysis sets the distribution impact as 21.866.  \n \n9. \nMajor donors in health and education are India, Denmark, Switzerland, UNICEF, WFP, \nand  the  World  Bank.    In  the  renewable  natural  resources  sector,  addressing  improved  food \nsecurity, major donors include Japan and the EU.  The Indian government is providing support \nto the roads and energy sector. Norway is providing institutional support for DOE, and UNDP is \nassisting in several sectors, including support for alternative energy.  \n \n10. \nElectrification can contribute to women\u2019s education and health and in income generation \nthat  is  home-based.  Inheritance  is  matrilineal;  however,  women  are  considered  less  capable \nand confident than men in matters of governance and interaction with external agencies.  \n \n11.  Women\u2019s  access  to  training  and  technology  is  limited  as  also  is  their  involvement  in \nbusiness  opportunities.  They  play  a  major  role  in  cottage  industries,  such  as  lemongrass  oil \nprocessing,  chilli  and  maize  processing,  and  weaving.  While  the  Project  tends  to  be  gender \nneutral, a number of enhancement measures such as training of electricians could be directed \nat women. NTTA has trained 79 local electricians, 13 of whom are women.  \n \n12. \nThere are two social risks - accidental shock and/or electrocution. BPC has a Customers \nServices Department that takes care of safety issues.  The unit is newly formed and so far has \nnot been able to undertake a systematic awareness campaign for villages newly connected to \nthe grid. However, BPC has begun awareness programs through newspapers, airing messages \non  the  radio,  issuing  safety  pamphlets,  and  village  meetings.  Information  includes  safety \naspects,  tariff,  policy,  and  information  on  appliances  and  usage.  A  revised  safety  manual  is \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nAppendix 12 \n\n  45\n\nbeing prepared to serve staff and beneficiaries.  The new energy bill will contain information on \nsafety  as  well  as  contact  details  for  faults  and  complaints.    Stakeholder  participation  and \nconsultation have been undertaken as part of a wider RE program.   \n \nThe  RE  process  is  one  of  consultation  beginning  with  dialogue  with  gups  (heads  of \n13. \nblocks) who, in consultation with their communities, identify the households to be connected and \nprovide  that  list  to  DOE  as  part  of  the  primary  or  initial  selection  process.    Stakeholder \nparticipation in TA 3825 (footnote 2) has included introductory meetings with key agencies and \nthe blocks in project areas.  Consultation with beneficiaries and directly affected people has also \nbeen  undertaken  through  the  social/poverty  and  environmental  assessment  process.  A \nparticipation strategy is incorporated into the existing communication process between DOE and \nbeneficiary  areas  and  will  be  an  integral  part  of  the  safety  and  awareness  program  and \nimplementation.  Participation will also be monitored as part of the project benefit monitoring.   \n \n14. \nThe  Project  will  have  no  adverse  impacts  on  labor  or  indigenous  people.  During \nimplementation, additional labor opportunities will be created for construction, portering, wiring, \nand repairs.  The Phase 1 Survey database will form the basis for benefit monitoring under the \nProject. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n\n\f46 \n\nAppendix 13 \n\n \nA. \n\nIntroduction \n\nSUMMARY INITIAL ENVIRONMENTAL EXAMINATION \n\nThe  Project  is  categorized  as  a  \u201cB\u201d  project  in  accordance  with  the  Asian  Development \n1. \nBank\u2019s  (ADB)  environmental  impact  assessment.  This  Project,  which  comprises  distribution \nlines and pole-mounted transformers, is also subject to Bhutan\u2019s Environmental Assessment Act \n2000. Therefore, an environmental clearance will be required for each stretch of distribution line.  \nA 5-kilometer (km) stretch of one of the distribution lines in Punaka will enter the buffer zone1 \n(about 3.5 km) and multiple-use2 zone (about 1.5 km) of the Jigme Dorji National Park. In this \ncontext,  the  Initial  Environmental  Examination  (IEE)  was  prepared  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nEnvironmental  Assessment  Guidelines  (2003).    This  appendix  is  based  on  information  in  the \nIEE that the Bhutan Power Corporation (BPC) submitted to ADB. \n \nB. \n \nThe Project is being prepared under the Ninth Five-Year Plan (NFPY), and is one of the \n2. \nrural  electrification  (RE)  projects  that  will  assist  the  Government  to  meet  its  goal  of  100% \nelectrification by the year 2020.  Under the NFYP, approximately 250 RE subprojects covering \n19  of  the  20  districts in  the  country  will  extend the  power  distribution  network  to  some  15,000 \nrural households. However, this Project will provide funding for the extension to only 8,000 rural \nhouseholds.  About  1,141  km  of  distribution  line  will  be  established  for  approximately  299 \nvillages.  \n \n\nDescription of the Project \n\nDescription of Project Activities \n\n \n\nNo.  District \n\n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n\nChhukha \nSamtse \nPunakha \nSarpang \nLhuentse \nMongar \nPemagatshel \nTrashigang \n\nLength  of  the  Distribution \nLine (km) \n189 \n174 \n80 \n138 \n117 \n135 \n170 \n138 \n\nVillages  Served  by  the  Project \n(No.) \n41\n39 \n35 \n23 \n31 \n25 \n33 \n72 \n\n \nC.  Description of the Environment \n \n3. \n \n\nBhutan\u2019s environment can be described as follows:   \n\n(i) \n\nTopography,  geology,  and  climate.  Significant  topographic  features  of  the \ncountry  are  the  high  Himalayas  in  the  northern  parts  with  many  peaks  and \nplateaus  and  large  mountain  ranges  and  deep  valleys  that  run  southward.  The \nsouthern  ends  of  the  ranges  plunge  down  to  rugged  foothills  and  the  alluvial \nplains of Assam and West Bengal in India. In general, the country\u2019s climate is wet \n\n                                                 \n1  \n\n2  \n\nBased  on  Jigme  Dorji  National  Park  Conservation  Management  Plan,  an  area  within  a  distance  of  3-5  km  from  the  park \nboundaries  is  categorized  as  a  buffer  zone.  The  buffer  zone  comes  under  the  purview  of  territorial  division,  not  under  park \nmanagement.  \nAccording to the Bhutan Forest and Nature Conservation Rules 2000, protected areas should be managed by implementing a \nzoning approach [Chapter VI, article 59(i) (a)].  Settlements and/or cultivation is allowed to be located in the multiple-use zone \n[Chapter VI, article 60(5)(b)(i)]. This distribution line aims to provide electricity for the community living in the multiple-use zone \nof the Jigme Dorji National Park.      \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 13 \n\n47 \n\nand hot in the south, dry and cold in the north, dry and warm in the inner valleys, \nmoist  and  cool  on  the  north-south  ranges,  and  alpine  and  arctic  in  the  high \nHimalayas.  Temperatures  vary  with  altitude,  air  temperatures  range  from  over \n200 C to below zero.  \n\nEcological resources. Forests cover 73% of the total land area. There are more \nthan  5,500  species  of  vascular  plants,  more  than  770  species  of  avifauna,  and \nmore than 165 species of mammals in Bhutan. There are three main ecofloristic \nzones:  the  alpine  zone,  the  temperate  zone,  and  the  subtropical  zone.  Within \nthese zones are eight types of coniferous, broadleaf, and scrub forests. The 770 \nspecies  of  avifauna  include  10  restricted  range  species  and  14  globally \nthreatened species. With a total of nine protected areas (national parks, wildlife \nsanctuaries, and nature reserves), parts of 14 districts fall inside these protected \nareas.  The  forests  of  Bhutan  are  home  to  one  of  the  world\u2019s  most  endangered \nspecies, i.e., the Bengal tiger. Ten districts have various sizes of suitable habitat \nfor this species. The snow leopard, another globally important species, resides in \nthe high-altitude areas of northern Paro, Thimphu, and Punakha and most of the \ncentral and western parts of Gasa. Takin, the national animal of the country, has \nbeen  spotted  mostly  in  northern  and  central  districts  of  Paro,  Ha,  Wangdue \nPhodrang, Tiongsa, and Bumthang. Habitat for the elephant, which is a protected \nspecies, starts in the southern area of Bhutan and continues into India. Patches \nof red panda and musk deer habitat are scattered over 15 districts in the country.  \n\nSocial environment. The population of Bhutan is about 695,000, about 80% of \nwhom  are  thought  to  reside  in  rural  areas.    The  crude  birth  rate  in  Bhutan  has \nremained fairly static at around 39 per 1,000 over 10 years (1984-1994). During \nthe same period, the crude death rate decreased significantly from 19.3 to 9 per \n1,000. As a result, the country\u2019s population increased by 30%.  Life expectancy is \naround 66 years for both men and women. The proportion of the population with \naccess to safe drinking water increased from 45% in 1996 to 78% in 2000, while \nthe population covered by some form of health care is 90%. Overall, the literacy \nrate is 46%.  Nearly a quarter of the Project\u2019s beneficiaries are from households \nfalling below the higher poverty line.  Some 18% are households falling below the \nlower  poverty  line  set  at  Nu612  per  capita  per  month  and  28%  are  considered \nvulnerable  (i.e.,  15%  above  the  higher  poverty  line  of  Nu748  per  capita  per \nmonth).    \n\n \n4. \nfollows:   \n\n \n(i) \n\nThe general environmental conditions along the alignment of the distribution lines are as \n\nChhukha.  Lines  will  run  mainly  along  the  highway.  Coniferous  and  broadleaf \nforests are the main vegetated areas through which the lines pass.  The right-of-\nway  (ROW)  will  require  clearance  of  0.4  km  of  dense  forest,  11.4  km  of  mild \nforest,  and  5  km  of  sparse  forest.  The  rest  of  the  alignment  passes  through \npasture  and  bush-land,  dryland  agriculture,  and  orchards.  Topographically,  the \nlines  cross  mostly  easy  terrain,  passing  over  17  km  of  rough  but  accessible \nterrain, 1 km of steep and rocky terrain, and over 5 km of steep forested terrain. \nThe lines will not go through areas with slopes greater than 45 degrees.  \n\nSamtse. The ROW will go through 5 km of mild forest, 16 km of sparse forest, 3 \nkm  of  pasture,  and  the  remainder  through  residential  and  agricultural  land.  The \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n\f48 \n\nAppendix 13 \n\n \n(iii) \n\n \n(iv) \n\n \n(v) \n\n \n(vii) \n\nROW goes through 9 km of steep forested area, 13 km of rough but accessible \nterrain; the rest passes easy terrain.  \n\nPunakha. The line will run along the road (Chubu, Dzoma, Goenshari). The rest \nof line will pass though spare forest, pasture, bush, agricultural wetland. The line \nwill  run  through  rough  but  accessible  and  easy  terrain.  Although  the  line  in \nGoenshari  runs  along  the  road,  this  line  will  pass  the  buffer  zone  and  multiple-\nuse zone of the Jigme Dorji National Park.  \n\nSarpang. The lines will pass through about 7 km of dense forest, 46 km sparse \nforest,  pastureland,  and  30  km  of  agricultural  lands.  The  terrain  is  rough  but \naccessible, and no high hill and steep slope are involved.    \n\nLhuentse.  The  lines  will  pass  through  28  km  sparse  forest,  11  km  of  pasture, \nand the rest will be agricultural lands, including paddy fields. Most of the lines run \nalong the highway or close to the highway. The lines will pass through 0.5 km of \nsteep forested and rocky terrain, 6 km of rough but accessible area terrain, and \nthe rest on easy terrain.  \n\n \n(vi)  Mongar.  About  52  km  of  the  lines  will  pass  through  sparse  forest  and,  14  km \nthrough pastures. The rest of the lines will pass agricultural lands.  About 17 km \nof the line will cross rough but accessible terrain, and the rest will pass through \neasy terrain.   \n\nPemagatshel.  The  lines  will  pass  through  24  km  of  sparse  forest,  11  km  of \npasture,  and  the  rest  through  agricultural  and  residential  lands.  About  25  km  of \nthe line will pass steep and rough terrain, and the rest will be on easy terrain.  \n\n \n(viii)  Trashigang.  There  are  22  distribution  lines  in  this  district.  Most  of  the  lines \ntraverse  sparse  forest  (62  km)  and  the  rest  pass  through  dry  agricultural  land, \nsome wet rice land, and orchards. \n\n \nD.Screening of Potential Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n \n5. \nThe  screening  of  potential  impacts  shows  no  significant  environmental  impact  due  to \nciting of these distribution lines and pole-mounted transformers substations, because use of the \nland below the transmission lines will not change. The alignment will also as much as possible \nbe  located  along,  or  close  to,  existing  roads  or  tracks.  However,  some  stretch  of  distribution \nlines  that  pass  through  forest  area  will  require  land  clearing.  The  distribution  lines  that  pass \nthrough forest area will only be executed after the Department of Forest Services (DOF) grants \nforest  clearances.  Land  clearing  will  be  limited  only  to  the  area  covered  by  the  clearance.  A \nstretch  of  distribution  line  in  Punakha  will  enter  the  buffer  zone  and  multiple-use  zone  of  the \nJigme  Dorji  National  Park.    However,  that  stretch  will  not  create  a  significant  impact  because \nonly about 5 km of the line will enter these zones and these areas are mostly agricultural lands \nand  have  no  ecological  significance.  The  construction  works  involving  these  areas  will  be \nundertaken only after the DOF\u2019s approval is obtained.  Further, during construction, continued \nconsultation with the park management officers will be undertaken. \n \nThe  environmental  impacts  associated  with  the  construction  period  will  be  minor.    In \n6. \nmost  cases,  the  construction  materials  and  equipment  will  be  manually  transported  from  the \nnearest  road.  Only  land  clearing  at  locations  with  steep  slope  gradients  may  trigger  erosion \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 13 \n\n49 \n\nINSTITUTIONAL  REQUIREMENTS  AND  ENVIRONMENTAL  MANAGEMENT \n\nproblems.  Planting  of  grass  to  provide  ground  cover  will  be  done  simultaneously  during \nconstruction or immediately after the completion of construction. Ground cover will also prevent \npole damage due to landslides. All poles will be located at adequate distance from water bodies.  \nThe  operations  stage  will  not  create  any  environmental  impact.  However,  routine  line \nmaintenance involving trimming of bushes or other vegetation under the lines, particularly in the \nforest  areas,  will  be  done  in  such  a  way  that  the  forest  ecosystem  is  not  affected.  Routine \nmaintenance for the pole-mounted transformers will generate only a small amount of waste oil \n(about  0.5  liter  per  year  based  on  previous  experience),  which  is  reused  for  lubrication.  The \nwaste  oil  will  not  contain  polychlorinated  biphenyls  (PCBs),  as  BPC  uses  only  PCB-free \ntransformers for new construction. \n \nE. \nMONITORING PLAN \n \n7. \nAn  environmental  management  and  monitoring  plan  was  prepared  for  the  Project.  \nDuring construction, regular inspection will be conducted, particularly during the rainy season, to \nensure  that  contractors  are  complying  with  all  clauses  in  the  contract  documents  specifying \nmitigation  measures  and  mechanisms  for  environmental  protection.    An  environmental \nclearance  for  constructing  each  distribution  line  is  required  from  the  National  Environment \nCommission. Continued consultation with park management is necessary before getting forest \nclearance  or  during  project  implementation  in  Punakha.  Furthermore,  forest  clearances  for  all \nthe work involving forestlands will be obtained before construction work in those areas begins. \nBPC  must  implement  all  conditions  of  the  environmental  clearance  and  forest  clearances. \nOverall  implementation  of  environmental  mitigation  measures  will  also  be  the  responsibility  of \nBPC.  Therefore,  BPC\u2019s  environmental  staff  who  will  be  hired  in  October  2003  and  field \nengineers  will  monitor  implementation  of  the  mitigation  measures  as  well  as  of  the \nenvironmental requirements of the environmental and forest clearances.  \n \nThe RE process is one of consultation beginning with dialogue with heads of blocks. The \n8. \nheads,  in  consultation  with  their  communities,  will  identify  and  list  the  households  to  be \nconnected and submit that list to the Department of Energy (DOE) as part of the primary initial \nselection  process.    Stakeholder  participation  in  TA  38253  has  included  introductory  meetings \nwith  key  agencies  and  the  blocks  in  the  project  areas.    Consultation  with  beneficiaries  and \ndirectly affected people has also been undertaken through the social/poverty and environmental \nassessment process.   \n \nF. Findings and Recommendations \n \n9. \nThe IEE found that the Project will have negligible effects on the ecology of the project \narea and will have a significantly positive overall effect on the socioeconomic well-being of the \nrural population that are beneficiaries of the Project. Benefits from this Project far outweigh the \nnegative  impact  when  mitigation  measures  are  adopted.  The  IEE  is  therefore  considered \nsufficient. \n \nG. \n \n10. \nOverall environmental impacts are deemed to be minor. The Project will not involve the \naccelerated  use  of  scarce  resources,  nor  will  it  favor  the  use  of  scarce  resources  to  satisfy \n\nConclusion \n\n                                                 \n3   TA  3825-BHU:  Rural  Electrification  and  Network  Expansion-Phase  1  Socio-Economic  Impact  of  Rural  Electrification,  Final \n\nReport, April 2003. \n\n\f50 \n\nAppendix 13 \n\nshort-term over long-term socioeconomic needs.
