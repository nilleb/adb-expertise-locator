An  initial  environment  examination  for  the  Program \nwas undertaken and its summary is a core appendix.  \n \nOver  the  past  decade,  Bangladesh  has  taken  great  strides  in  its \neconomic and social development. Yet, nearly half the population \nremains  poor,  and  per  capita  gross  domestic  product  was  just \n$445  in  fiscal  year  2005.  Only  one  third  of  the  households  have \naccess  to  electricity  and  those  with  access  to  electricity  receive \npoor, unreliable service characterized by frequent power outages \nand  low  voltage.  This  results  from  insufficient  power  generation \ncapacity  as  well  as  poor  transmission  and  distribution  systems. \nInadequate  electricity  supply  has  been  a  major  constraint  on \neconomic growth and poverty reduction in Bangladesh. Promoting \nsustainable economic growth by providing reliable power supply is \nthe  main  strategic  pillar  for  reducing  poverty  in  ADB\u2019s  country \nstrategy and program for 2006\u20132010.  \n \nThe Government has issued a 3-year road map in 2006 for power \nsector  reforms \nintensive  consultations  with  various \nstakeholders,  including  key  development  partners,  setting  out \ndetailed  time-bound  action  plans  for  the  reform  process  and \ninvestment  program \nfor  2006\u20132008.  The  3-year  road  map \nunderpins  the  principal  reform  components  presented  in  the \nGovernment\u2019s  Vision  and  Policy  Statement  on  Power  Sector \nReforms  issued  in  February  2000  to  provide  reliable  electricity \nsupply  to  the  entire  population  by  2020  at  an  affordable  price. \nThese principal reform components include (i) segregating power \ngeneration,  transmission,  and  distribution  functions  into  separate \nservices;  (ii)  commercializing  emerging  power  sector  entities;  (iii) \neffective  regulation  under  the  Bangladesh  Energy  Regulatory \nCommission  (BERC);  (iv)  promoting  private  sector  participation \n\nthrough \n\n\fii \n\n \n\n \nThe Program Loan \n \nOutcome \n\nin \n\nimplementing  a \n\nand  public-private  partnership  by  establishing  an  enabling \nenvironment;  (v) \nfinancial  restructuring  and \nrecovery plan for the sector entities; (vi) introducing cost-reflective \ntariff  principles  to  achieve  financial  viability  of  the  sector  entities; \n(vii)  developing  the  capacity  of  sector  entities;  and  (viii)  boosting \noperational  performance  by  reducing  system  losses,  improving \ncollections to energy import, and reducing arrears.  \n \nApproved in 2003, ADB\u2019s first power sector development program \n(PSDP) \nfor  Bangladesh  has  yielded  numerous  positive \ndevelopments.  A  major  breakthrough  was  the  emergence  of  a \nnew  culture  of  accountability  for  electricity  used  by  public \nconsumers.  This  helped  substantially  to  reduce  the  outstanding \ndues  of  the  Government  and  its  agencies.  The  two  major \ncompanies \nthe  power  sector,  Power  Grid  Company  of \nBangladesh Limited (PGCB) and Dhaka Electric Supply Company \nLimited (DESCO) have become profitable since 2004. The PSDP \nalso  supported  the  launch  of  BERC  and  laid  the  foundation  for \nrestructuring the remaining key power sector entities, Bangladesh \nPower  Development  Board  (BPDB)  and  Dhaka  Electric  Supply \nAuthority (DESA). \n \nBuilding  on  the  success  of  the  PSDP  and  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s \ncountry  and  strategy  program  for  Bangladesh,  the  Program  aims \nto  promote  sustained  economic  growth  by  providing  further \nsupport  and  incentives  to  the  Government  for  continued  power \nsector  reform  activities  through  financial  and  organizational \nrestructuring,  improved  sector  governance,  promotion  of  private \nsector  participation,  and  capacity  development,  while  assisting  in \nexpanding clean fuel generation capacity, enhancing transmission \nnetwork  reliability  and  efficiency,  and  improving  the  quality  of \nsupply in Dhaka city and the surrounding areas, the major power \nmarket. The Program is linked to the Government\u2019s sector reform \nroad  map,  is  a  part  of  the  least-cost  development  plan  for  the \npower sector, and is accorded high priority by the Government.  \n \nThe  investment  components  are  also  expected  to  accelerate  the \nreform  program  by  (i)  transferring  the  remaining  DESA  area  to  a \nnewly  corporatized  entity,  Dhaka  Power  Distribution  Company \nLimited  (DPDC),  and  (ii)  creating  a  new  generation  company  in \nthe northwestern region of the country. They will also enhance the \noperational performance of the sector entities by reducing system \nlosses and generating additional revenues.  \n \n \n \nThe  policy  actions  supported  by  the  program  loan  will  help \nimprove  sustainability  of  the  power  sector  through  financial  and \norganizational restructuring and will focus on five key outputs that \nwill (i) develop and implement a national action plan for continuing \npower  sector  reforms,  (ii)  establish  a  fully  functional  legal  and \n\n\f \n\niii\n\nregulatory  framework,  (iii)  enhance  the  financial  health  of  power \nsector  entities,  (iv)  further  restructure  the  sector  entities,  and  (v) \npromote private sector participation and public-private partnership. \n \n\n \nLoan Amount and Terms  A  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to  $60  million  will  be \nprovided  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Fund  resources  for  the  program \nloan.  The  loan  will  have  a  term  of  24  years,  including  a  grace \nperiod of 8 years. The interest charge will be at a rate of 1% per \nannum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter.  \n \n30 June 2008 \n\n \nEstimated Program \nCompletion Date \n \nTranching \n\n \nExecuting Agency \n\n \nProcurement \n\n \nCounterpart Funds \n\n \nThe Project Loan \n \nOutcome \n\n \nRationale \n \n \n\nloan, \n\nincluding \n\n \nThe  loan  will  be  released  in  two  equal  tranches,  each  of \nSDR20,225,000  ($30  million  equivalent)  upon  the  Government\u2019s \nand power sector entities\u2019 complying with the conditions specified \nfor their release.  \n \nThe executing agencies (EAs) will be the Finance Division of the \nMinistry of Finance (MOF) and the Power Division of the Ministry \nof Power, Energy and Mineral Resources (MPEMR). \n \nThe proceeds of the program loan will finance the costs (excluding \nlocal taxes and duties) of eligible items, produced in and procured \nfrom ADB\u2019s member countries. \n \nCounterpart  funds  generated  from  the  proceeds  of  the  program \nloan will be used to finance the adjustment costs associated with \nfunding  of  unfunded  pension \nthe  program \nobligations  and  gratuities  and  settlement  of  the  Government\u2019s \noutstanding  debts  as  well  as  those  of  its  autonomous  and \nsemi-autonomous bodies to the power sector entities.  \n \n \n \nThe  outcome  of  the  project  loan  is  expanded  clean-fuel  power \ngeneration  capacity  and  improved  efficiency  in  transmission  and \ndistribution systems. This is to be achieved by (i) increased peak \nload  generation  capacity  based  on  clean  natural  gas,  and  (ii) \naugmentation  and  expansion  of  power \ntransmission  and \ndistribution systems. \n \nGeneration \n \nThe  ADB-financed  power  system  master  plan  update  (PSMPU) \nestimates that demand for electricity will grow at an annual rate of \nabout  8.0%  for  the  next  10  years  and  that  about  20%  of  the \nadditional generation capacity will be required to serve peak load. \nEven  if  all  presently  planned  power  plants  are  constructed  as \nscheduled,  a  shortfall  in  generating  capacity  of  more  than  2,000 \nmegawatt (MW) is expected by 2010 and over 5,500 MW by 2015. \n\n \n\n\fiv \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n\nfor  electricity \n\nrapidly  growing  demand \n\nThe  PSMPU  also  estimates  that  $5.4  billion  of  new  investment \nwould be required by 2015 for new generation capacity, of which \nabout half would be covered by the private sector, and the rest by \nthe  Government  and  development  partners.  New  peak  power \ngeneration  capacity  is  urgently  needed  in  the  northern  and \nwestern  regions  of  Bangladesh  to  help  balance  loads,  while \nimproving voltages, stability, and system efficiency. \n \nTransmission \n \nThe \nrequires  a \ncorresponding  increase  in  the  capability  and  efficiency  of  the \ntransmission  system  to  evacuate  the  power  from  new  power \nplants and make it available to existing and new substations. The \nPSMPU\u2019s  least-cost  expansion  plan  concludes  that  additional \ntransmission  capacity  of  4,875  megavolt-ampere  (MVA)  of \n230/132  kilovolt  (kV)  transformers  will  be  required  by  2010  and \nanother 4,650 MVA by 2015. This compares with existing capacity \nof 3,925 MVA. More than three times the current large transformer \ncapacity  will  be  necessary  to  meet  demand  in  a  reliable  manner \nby 2015. Approximately $1.0 billion of additional investment would \nbe  needed  to  meet  the  demand  by  2015.  Most  of  that  will  be \nfunded by the Government and development partners, and partly \nthrough  local  capital  mobilized  through  issuing  bonds  and  equity \nsecurities in the local market.  \n \nDistribution  \n \nExpansion  of  the  distribution  systems  in  Dhaka  has  struggled  to \nkeep  up  with  rapid  growth  in  demand.  Several  distribution \nsubstations  are  very  old,  while  main  equipment  and  protection \nsystems  have  deteriorated.  The  transformers  are  overloaded, \nwhich contributes to faster deterioration. Low voltage is a problem \nboth at the supply side of the substations and at the demand side \ndue to long runs of overloaded distribution lines. Operating under \nsuch  conditions  contributes  to  high  distribution  losses  as  well  as \nfaster  deterioration  of  equipment  condition  and  performance. \nGreater  Dhaka  Area\u2019s  distribution  systems  need  urgently  to  be \nupgraded to meet the ever-growing demand, which is expected to \ndouble  by  2015.  This  will  require  around  $1.5  billion  of  new \ninvestment to be met by the Government, development partners, \nand local capital. \n \nCapacity Development \n \nAs  a  result  of  implementing  the  reform  policy  since  1994,  a \nnumber  of  new  public  sector  entities  have  been  established  and \nmade  operational,  and  more  entities  are  emerging  in  the  sector. \nThe  capacity  development  effort  in  the  Bangladesh  power  sector \nhas so far been undertaken at the entity level, limiting efficient use \n\n\f \n\nv\n\nof  financial  and  human  resources.  To  achieve  sustained  and \nbalanced  growth  of  the  power  sector,  the  Government  drafted  a \nmedium-term,  sector-wide  capacity  development  program  in  July \n2006  covering  a  wide  spectrum  of  power  sector  operations.  This \nfinancial  management, \nespecially  addresses  corporate  and \ninformation  and  communication  technology,  long-term  system \nplanning  and  future  project  preparations,  good  governance, \ncustomer  relations,  research  and  development,  and  human \nresource  development  and  training.  This  coordinated  capacity \ndevelopment program will ensure balanced capacity development \namong sector entities.  \n \nPart  A:  Clean  Energy  Capacity  Expansion.

ADB  will  also  monitor \nthe overall performance of the EAs. \n \nProcurement  of  goods  and  services  to  be  financed  under  the \nproject  loan  will  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nProcurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time). \nFor  such  procurement,  bid  packaging  and  specifications  will  be \nprepared  in  a  manner  to  ensure  maximum  competition  under \ninternational  competitive  bidding.  A \nthird-party  pre-shipment \ninspection  provision  will  be  adopted  to  ensure  quality  of  goods \nand equipment to be procured.   \n \nInternational  consultants  associated with  national  consultants  will \nassist BPDB/NWPGC for part A and PGCB for part B to prepare \nbidding  documents,  including  basic  design,  evaluation  of  bids, \nfinal design approval, and project implementation supervision that \nincludes approval of final design. They will also assist the Power \nDivision  of  MPEMR  in  capacity  development  under  part  E.  All \nconsultants will be recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines \non the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time) \nand \nthe  quality-  and  cost-based  selection  method  will  be \nimplemented.  \n \nThe combined interventions of the proposed project and program \nloans  are  strongly  interlinked  and  will  further  enhance  the \nGovernment\u2019s  ongoing  reform  program,  strengthen  the  financial \nposition of sector entities, enhance public-private partnership, and \nimprove  sector  and  corporate  governance.  Thereby,  they  will \nassure  sustained  growth  in  the  sector  and  gradually  relieve  the \nGovernment of providing financial support to the sector.  \n \nThe project loan is expected to reduce system losses and improve \nquality  of  supply,  leading  to  more  efficient  use  of  energy  and \nmaking  more  power  available  to  support  sustained  economic \ngrowth, while offsetting growth in green house gas emissions. The \n300  MW  of  additional  clean-fuel  power  generation  capacity,  900 \nMVA  of  additional  transmission  capacity,  and  1,020  MVA  of \nadditional distribution capacity under the project loan are expected \nto result in more efficient and reliable service delivery, particularly \nbenefiting  230,000  new  consumers  (domestic,  commercial, \nirrigation, industrial and others). It will also directly benefit 820,000 \nexisting  consumers  in  Dhaka  area  by  providing  reliable  power \nsupply. Reliable power supply will help manufacturing and service \nindustries,  including  the  garment  sector  that  employs  several \n\n \n\n\fviii \n\n \n\n \nRisks and Assumptions \n\nmillion poor people, particularly poor women. Poor and vulnerable \nconsumers, including hospitals, schools, and other social facilities, \nwhich are often the hardest hit by inadequate power supply, load \nshedding,  and  poor  quality  of  power,  are  likely  to  benefit  directly \nfrom  the  project  loan.  A  positive,  direct  impact  on  local  labor  is \nexpected  during  implementation  of  the  project  loan,  and  an \nindirect impact will occur due to the enhanced income-generating \nopportunities from increased access to electricity.   \n \nThe program loan will result in better service to the public through \nimproved  governance  in  the  sector.  The  functioning  independent \nsector  regulator  will  provide  transparent  consultative  procedures \nfor  issuing  tariff  rulings  that  protect  consumer  interests.  Product \ncosts  might  also  decrease  due  to  price  rationalization  and \nefficiency gains. Employees will benefit from a new management \nstructure  and  skills  training.  Continued  sector  reforms  supported \nby  the  program  loan  will  facilitate  power  sector  entities  to \ntransition  from  budget  \u201csinks\u201d  to  public  revenue  sources,  freeing \nup government funds for critical social investments.    \n \nThe Program faces several risks, and particularly those related to \nsustaining  political  commitment  to  underpin  the  reform  process, \nregulatory capacity to ensure BERC\u2019s independence and to make \ntimely  regulatory  decisions,  governance  and  corruption,  and \nimplementation delays.  \n \nPolitical  Commitment. The success of the Program depends on \nthe  Government\u2019s  strong  commitments  to  power  sector  reforms \nand,  more  specifically,  to  successfully  creating  a  new  power \ngeneration company and transferring operational authority for the \nDESA area to DPDC to implement the project loan. There is a risk \nthat \nfuture  political \ndevelopments. However, this risk is considered low as the sector \nhas  comprehensive  experience  from  previous  projects  in  setting \nup  new  companies  and  transferring  operational  authorities.  The \nGovernment has also shown consistent commitments to reforming \nthe  sector  since  adopting  a  power  sector  reform  policy  paper  in \n1994.  Furthermore,  the  success  of  corporatized  entities  clearly \nindicates the direction of the reform, which is widely recognized by \nvarious stakeholders.  \n \nRegulatory Capacity. Parliament passed the Bangladesh Energy \nRegulatory  Commission  Act  2003  to  give  the  regulatory  body  a \nwider  mandate  and  independence.  This  Act  provides  the  legal \nthe \nframework \nframework  in  place  for  BERC  to  operate,  it  is  now  up  to  the \nGovernment to ensure that regulatory actions are taken based on \ncommercial  principles  and  without  outside  interference.  Given  its \ncentral  role  in  various  sector  reform  activities,  BERC  should  be \nable  to  undertake  its  mandate  with  adequate  human  resources \nand an operating budget. Recent preparation of the Government\u2019s \n\nthese  actions  may  be  affected  by \n\nindependent  sector  regulator.  With \n\nfor  an \n\n\f \n\nix\n\n3-year power sector reform road map is a good move forward, as \nit  provides  a  specific  target  for  a  fully  functional  BERC.  The \nProgram supports the road map\u2019s implementation by underpinning \nthe Government\u2019s initial actions to make BERC fully operational. \n \nGovernance.  Good  governance  is  an  essential  precondition  for \nsustainable  development  in  Bangladesh\u2019s  power  sector.  The \nGovernment  has  put  good  governance  at  the  center  of  power \nsector  reform  policies.  Various  measures  have  been  included  in \nthe  Program\u2019s  design  to  promote  good  governance  and  mitigate \nthe  risk  of  corruption  by  enhancing  predictability,  transparency, \nand  accountability  in  doing  business.  These  measures  include, \namong others, continued corporatization and commercialization of \nsector entities, strengthening the sector regulator, and instituting a \nstrengthened financial management and procurement system. \n \nProject Readiness. Previous ADB-financed projects in the power \nsector in Bangladesh have experienced repeated delays in project \nimplementation, frequently caused by the EAs\u2019 inadequate project \nreadiness. This has resulted in delayed government approvals for \nprojects\u2019 component proposals, slow progress in land acquisition, \nand  cumbersome  procurement  procedures.  Taking  into  account \nthese lessons learned, the EAs and Government have undertaken \nvarious  actions  with  regard  to  this  project.  The  EAs  have \nappointed  the  required  project  teams,  including  the  project \ndirectors, for implementing the project components. In addition, all \nthe  development  project  proposals  have  already  been  prepared \nby  the  EAs  and  approved  by  the  Government.  Land  acquisitions \nthe  project  components  have  also  been \nfor  constructing \ncompleted  or  are  in  advanced  stages.  As  all  the  project  loan \ncomponents  will  be  implemented  by  the  corporatized  entities, \naccelerated  procurement  processes  are  anticipated  since  the \ndecisions  can  be  made  by  the  respective  board  of  directors \nwithout referring them to the Government. Apart from these, draft \nbidding documents for  procuring goods, works, and services and \ndraft \nimplementation \nconsultants have already been submitted to ADB by the EAs, and \nseveral  bidding  documents  have  been  issued  to  accelerate  the \nfront-end activities.  \n\nfor  proposals \n\nrecruiting \n\nrequests \n\nfor \n\n \n\n\fx \n\n \n\n\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n1. \nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on three proposed \nloans  to  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  Bangladesh  for  the  Sustainable  Power  Sector  Development \nProgram (the Program). The design and monitoring framework of the Program is presented in \nAppendix 1.  \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE SECTOR: PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nA. \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n2. \nAlthough Bangladesh has performed generally well on the macroeconomic front over the \npast decade, inadequate electricity supply has been a major constraint on economic growth and \npoverty reduction. The electrification ratio is still very low, as only a third of the population has \naccess  to  electricity.  At  just  about  158  kilowatt-hours  (kWh)  annually,  per  capita  generation  is \namong the lowest in the world. The country\u2019s current dependable generating capacity is about \n4,120 megawatts (MW), while peak demand is about 4,700 MW. In fiscal year (FY) 2005, load \nshedding  in  the  range  of  7\u2013770  MW  was  required  on  287  days  for  a  total  of  1,433  hours.  In \nFY2004,  this  was  in  a  range  of  2\u2013694  MW  on  232  days  and  totaled  951  hours.  As  shown  in \nTable  1,  load  shedding  increased  in  frequency  and  intensity  until  the  late  1990s  and  the \nsituation improved somewhat in the early 2000s. Over the past 3 years, however, the situation \nhas worsened as load growth has expanded faster than supply capacity. This trend is expected \nto continue in the near future. Erratic power supply tends to increase consumers\u2019 unwillingness \nto pay their bills, which leads to shortages of funds for maintenance. This, in turn, causes supply \ninterruptions  to  industry  and  residences,  hampers  commercial  activity,  and  jeopardizes  public \nsafety.  Furthermore,  this  situation  encourages  development  of  costly  backup  self-generation. \nThe  Government\u2019s  highest  priorities  are  to  minimize  the  number,  duration,  and  impact  of \nload-shedding events.   \n \n\nFY1994 \n2,608 \n\u2014 \n1,875 \n23\u2013500 \n\nFY2002 \n4,230 \n3,659 \n3,217 \n5\u2013367 \n\nTable 1: Trend in Power Supply and Demand in Bangladesh \n(megawatts) \n \nFY1999 \n3,603 \n2,881 \n2,449 \n16\u2013774 \n\nItem \nInstalled Capacity \nPeak Demand \nServed Generation \nLoad Shedding \n\u2014 = not available, FY = fiscal year. \nSource: Bangladesh Power Development Board. \n \nThe  power  sector  in  Bangladesh  performed  poorly  until  the  early  1990s.  The  major \n3. \nconstraints  in  the  sector  were  (i)  lack  of  institutional  capability,  (ii)  unavailability  of  long-term \ndomestic  capital  for  financing  investments,  (iii)  limited  foreign  exchange  availability,  (iv)  poor \nmanagement  systems  and  procedures,  (v)  low  employee  commitment,  and  (vi)  institutional \nweaknesses  in  governance.  To  improve  the  sector\u2019s  performance,  the  Government  adopted  a \npolicy paper in 1994 entitled Power Sector Reforms in Bangladesh (PSRB) in consultation with \nmajor  development  partners. 1 With  initiation  of  these  reforms,  the  sector\u2019s  organization  has \nchanged.

Today, several \npublic-private  and  private  sector  entities  are  licensed  to  construct  and  operate  generating \nfacilities.  Power  Grid  Company  of  Bangladesh  Limited  (PGCB)  has  taken  over  all  of  BPDB\u2019s \ntransmission  assets  and  most  of  DESA\u2019s  transmission  assets,  and  Dhaka  Electric  Supply \nCompany  Limited  (DESCO)  has  taken  over  distribution  assets  in  some  part  of  Dhaka  city. \nElectricity  distribution  in  most  rural  areas  of  Bangladesh  is  the  responsibility  of  the  70  rural \nelectricity  cooperatives  (PBSs),  which  are  organized,  initially  funded,  and  monitored  by  Rural \nElectrification  Board  (REB).  Dhaka  Power  Distribution  Company  Limited  (DPDC)  was \nestablished in 2005 to take over DESA\u2019s distribution assets. \n \nThe  changes  in  the  business  environment  and  organization  resulting  from  adoption  of \n4. \nthe  PSRB  have  yielded  notable  improvements  in  the  power  sector  entities\u2019  operational  and \nfinancial performance. In particular, the sector\u2019s overall system losses against gross generation \nhave  been  reduced  significantly\u2014from  37.2%  in  FY1994  to  25.0%  in  FY  2005.  For  the  same \nperiod, the sector\u2019s ratio of average collection to import has been improved from about 66% to \nover 80%, as shown in Table 2 below.

The ADB-financed power system master plan update (PSMPU) 2 estimates \nthat demand for electricity will grow at an annual rate of about 8.0% for the next 10 years, and \n\n                                                 \n2  ADB.  2004.

Manila.  \n\n\fabout  20%  of  the  additional  capacity  by  2025  will  be  required  to  serve  peak  load.  Even  if  all \npresently planned power plants are constructed as scheduled, a shortfall of generation capacity \nof over 2,000 MW is expected by 2010 and over 5,500 MW by 2015, of which 750 MW would be \npeaking capacity. To meet the Government\u2019s goal of providing reliable and quality electricity at \naffordable prices to all the population by 2020, an additional 12,000 MW of generation capacity \nwill be required. \n \n6. \nLimitations  in  the  existing  transmission  system  also  require  immediate  attention.  The \nrapidly growing demand requires a corresponding increase in the capability of the transmission \nsystem  to  evacuate  the  power  from  new  plants  and  make  it  available  to  existing  and  new \nsubstations.  Some  areas  in  the  country  are  presently  served  through  weak  33-kilovolt  (kV) \ndistribution  links  that  face  frequent  outages,  provide  low  voltages,  and  create  maintenance \nproblems.  The  PSMPU\u2019s  least-cost  expansion  plan  concludes  that  additional  transmission \ncapacity of 4,875 megavolt-ampere (MVA) of 230/132 kV transformers will be required by 2010 \nand  another  4,650  MVA  by  2015.  Existing  capacity  is  3,925  MVA.  More  than  three  times  the \ncurrent large transformer capacity will be necessary to meet demand reliably by 2015. \n \n7. \nExpansion of the distribution systems in Dhaka has struggled to keep up with the rapid \ngrowth  in  demand.  Several  33/11  kV  substations  are  more  than  30  years  old.  The  main \nequipment  and  circuit  breaker  protection  systems  have  deteriorated  and  the  transformers  are \noverloaded,  contributing  to  even  faster  deterioration.  Load  shedding  remains  the  only  tool  to \ncontrol  system  overload.  Few  substations  have  backup  transformers  to  provide  reliable  and \nstable power supply to feed the load of the substation in the event of an outage. As a result of \nlong  runs  of  low-voltage  lines  that  are  often  overloaded,  low  voltage  is  a  problem  both  at  the \nsupply side of the substations and at the demand side. Lower power factors exacerbate voltage \nproblems,  but  many  of  the  capacitors  installed  to  help  control  power  factor  are  not  functional, \nand most of the power factor meters are defective. Operating under such conditions contributes \nto high losses as well as faster deterioration of equipment condition and performance. Dhaka\u2019s \ndistribution  systems  face  the  challenge  of  rehabilitating  the  existing  system  while  meeting \ndemand that is expected to double by 2015. \n \n8. \nThe PSMPU estimates that the total investment required for generation and transmission \nby 2025 will be about $10.5 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively. It is also estimated that about \n$6.3 billion will be required for distribution to serve the generation and transmission expansions. \nDetails of the total estimated investment requirements are shown in Table 3. \n \n\nTable 3: Estimated Investment Requirements through 2025  \n($ million) \n \nTransmission  \n563 \n175 \n315 \n145 \n1,198 \n\nDistribution  \n2,041 \n1,296 \n1,715 \n1,248 \n6,300 \n\nGeneration \n3,227 \n2,232 \n2,871 \n2,172 \n10,502 \n\nFiscal Year \n2006\u20132010 \n2011\u20132015 \n2016\u20132020 \n2021\u20132025 \nTotal \n\nSources: power system master plan update and Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\nTotal \n5,831 \n3,703 \n4,901 \n3,565 \n18,000 \n\n \n\n2. \n\nRegulatory Framework \n\n \n\n \n\n9. \nEffective regulation of the sector is crucial to ensuring sustainability of the sector entities, \nestablishing a level playing field for all entities, and providing confidence to potential investors. \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\n3. \n\nFinancial Performance and Electricity Tariff \n\nTo  achieve  this,  Bangladesh  Energy  Regulatory  Commission  (BERC)  was  established  in  April \n2004 as an independent energy sector regulator under the Energy Regulatory Commission Act \n2003 to (i) set electricity tariffs and determine the corresponding performance norms; (ii) collect, \nverify, and disseminate power statistics; (iii) review and approve long-term power planning; (iv) \ncreate  and  maintain  a  nondiscriminatory  and  commercial  business  environment  in  the  sector; \nand (v) adjudicate disputes between sector entities. The United States Agency for International \nDevelopment (USAID) has provided technical assistance (TA) to establish BERC and to provide \ninstitutional  capacity  building  and  training  by  identifying  problems  and  introducing  relevant \nexperience  from  other  countries.  With  this  support  from  USAID  and  temporary  staff  deputed \nfrom the Government, BERC has finalized its licensing regulations and drafted tariff regulations. \nMainly  due  to  the  absence  of  an  approved  organogram,3 however,  BERC  is  unable  to  recruit \nsuitable staff, and that impedes its full functioning. \n \n \n \n10. \nThe Government and power sector entities in Bangladesh have taken tangible steps to \nenhance the financial performance of the sector entities. In parallel with the Government\u2019s effort \nto instill a new corporate culture in the sector through corporatization and commercialization, the \ntwo  major  companies  of  the  power  sector,  PGCB  and  DESCO,  have  undertaken  a  number  of \nreform measures to improve their operational efficiency and financial positions. These include (i) \na  change  in  PGCB  billing  procedures  for  wheeling  charges  from  asset-based  billing  to \nenergy-based billing at the distribution end, (ii) load balancing among different transformers, (iii) \nexpansion  of  computerized  billing  and  ledger  updating  systems,  (iv) upgrading  of  their  power \nsupply systems, (v) expanded use of prepaid meters and capacitor banks, and (vi) time-of-use \ntariffs  for  consumers  connected  at  33  kV  and  11  kV.  PGCB  and  DESCO  have  become \nfinancially  self-reliant  since  FY2004.  They  reported  net  profit  before  tax  of  Tk422  million  and \nTk551 million, respectively, in FY2005. \n \nIn  contrast  to  PGCB  and  DESCO,  BPDB  and  DESA  have  continuously  made  large \n11. \nlosses,  with  a  damaging  impact  on  Government  finances.  These  entities  are  technically \ninsolvent, as their current liabilities exceed realizable current assets and they have accumulated \nlarge  unmet  debt  service  liabilities  to  the  Government.  As  of  30  June  2005,  BPDB  had  debt \nservice arrears to the Government  of Tk57.55 billion (equivalent to about $820 million). DESA \nhas accumulated significant liabilities that include unpaid import bills from BPDB and wheeling \ncharges  from  PGCB.  As  of  30  June  2005,  these  liabilities  were  equivalent  to  1,049  days  (34 \nmonths)  of  DESA\u2019s  average  energy  import  bill.  There  is  no  likelihood  of  these  amounts  being \nrepaid. Rather, these liabilities will continue to grow under the present policies. \n \n12. \nThere are three types of tariffs in the power sector in Bangladesh, namely, (i) wholesale \ntariffs,  (ii)  transmission  wheeling  charges,  and  (iii)  retail  distribution  tariffs  charged  to  end-use \nconsumers. Up until 2003, the Government had a semiannual automatic power tariff adjustment \nformula  to  reflect  fuel  price  changes  and  local  currency  fluctuations.  With  establishment  of \nBERC in April 2004, the responsibility for power tariff setting was delegated to BERC. Especially \nbecause BERC has not yet been fully functional, however, there has been no tariff adjustment \nsince  September  2003,  despite  significant  fuel  price  hikes  and  local  currency  depreciations. \nThat  exacerbates  the  financial  difficulties  of  the  sector  entities.  A  detailed  tariff  analysis  has \nbeen undertaken. It is provided in Supplementary Appendix A, and its summary is in Appendix 3. \n \n\n                                                 \n3   In  Bangladesh,  an  organogram  generally  includes  the  organizational  chart,  pay  structure,  conditions  of  services, \n\nrecruitment procedures, and job descriptions.  \n\n\fThe tariff analysis reveals that BPDB, in particular, is facing a serious financial hardship, \n13. \nas it has to absorb the losses arising from the difference between the wholesale tariffs and its \npooled generation cost. While its pooled average cost of generation is Tk2.26 per kWh, BPDB \nsells electricity to distribution entities at Tk1.84\u2013Tk1.94 per kWh, aggregating to losses of about \nTk9.30 billion per annum. The tariff analysis shows that PGCB has a tariff that enables it to earn \na  profit,  with  wheeling  charges  of  Tk0.23  per  kWh  for  bulk  delivery  to  distribution  entities  and \nthat  the  existing  transmission  wheeling  tariff  may  be  retained  until  FY2007.  Similarly  to \nwholesale generation tariffs, retail tariffs are not structured for cost recovery and are essentially \ninflexible  to  such  external  price  fluctuations  as  increases  in  fuel  costs,  local  currency \ndepreciation,  and  inflation.  The  tariff  analysis  concludes  that  sizeable  tariff  increases  will  be \nneeded to restore balance between tariffs and the underlying cost of service. Increases should \nbe  spread  over  a  number  of  years,  however,  to  minimize  the  adverse  impact  downstream.  If \nbulk  supply  tariff  and  retail  tariffs  are  raised  by 10%  on  average  now  and  there  will  be  further \nreal  increases  of  5%  in  FY2009  and  FY2010,  the  tariffs  would  be  brought  into  line  with \nunderlying  cost  of  service  by  2010.  In  view  of  the  urgency  to  address  the  tariff  issues,  the \nGovernment has initiated a proposal to increase the wholesale tariff by about 10% and the retail \ntariff  by  some  5%.  Pursuant  to  the  BERC  Act,  a  public  hearing  was  held  by  BERC  in  early \nOctober 2006 for the proposed tariff increase. The tariff increase became effective on 1 March \n2007.  \n \nGiven  the  high  cost  of  generation,  which  is  partly  due  to  supply  shortages  that  force \n14. \nBPDB to purchase power from all available generation units regardless of cost and operational \nefficiency,  the  Government  is  now  pursuing  several  less-costly  natural  gas-fired  independent \npower producer (IPP) projects totaling about 1,400 MW of new generation capacity. These are \nin contract-awarding stage or bidding stages. In parallel, the Government is pursuing 1,000 MW \nof gas-fired plants through public sector investments on the basis of the least-cost option. Apart \nfrom the effort for tariff increase and measures to construct less-costly natural gas-fired power \nplants  to  bring  down  the  overall  generation  cost,  the  Government  is  taking  a  multifaceted \napproach  to  achieve  a  sustainable  power  sector  through  a  combination  of  various  measures, \nincluding (i) putting BERC into full operation to gradually implement the cost recovery principle \nin tariff settings pursuant to the Government\u2019s policy, (ii) further restructuring the power sector \nentities  to  improve  their  operational  performance  as  envisaged  in  the  Government\u2019s  reform \nprogram,  (iii)  implementing  various  system  loss  reduction  programs,  and  (iv)  preparing  and \nimplementing a financial restructuring plan for the sector entities, in particular BPDB and DESA. \n \n15. \nAs  autonomous  corporate  governance  is  a  precondition  for  achieving  financial  health, \nthe  Cabinet  Committee  on  Economic  Affairs  of  the  Government  approved  proposals  for \ncorporatizing BPDB and DESA in June and July 2004, respectively. On 25 October 2005, DESA \nwas incorporated as DPDC to take over DESA\u2019s distribution systems. To allow corporatization \nof BPDB, a draft memorandum and articles of association have been prepared for review by the \nGovernment. Corporatizaton of BPDB and DESA, including human resource issues such as the \nemployee  retrenchment  plan  is  being  assisted  by  ADB  TA4626-BAN 4  and  TA3978-BAN, 5 \nrespectively.  In  parallel  with  the  corporatization  process,  ADB  TA4379-BAN  (footnote  2)  has \nassisted the Government by preparing a draft financial restructuring plan for BPDB and DESA. \n \n\n                                                 \n4 ADB. 2005.

Despite \ngood  progress  in  many  social  indicators,  perceived  corruption  adds  to  the  costs  of  doing \nbusiness  and  reduces  the  nation\u2019s  competitiveness  and  attractiveness  for  foreign  direct \ninvestment.  Significant  governance  challenges  in  Bangladesh  occur  at  three  levels:  national, \nsector,  and  corporate.  At  the  national  level,  ADB  has  attempted  to  support  anticorruption \nmeasures through TA 4140-BAN6 by promoting medium- to long-term development of collective \nanticorruption efforts at various institutions, including in the power sector. This TA has built on \nenactment  of  the  Anticorruption  Commission  Act  and  the  establishment  in  2004  of  the \nAnticorruption  Commission.  ADB  has  launched  TA4734-BAN7 to  support  capacity  building  to \nmake the commission operational. In parallel, ADB is assisting the Government in preparing a \ncomprehensive national integrity strategy under TA4744-BAN.8 Public procurement procedures \nthat  are  universally  associated  with  high  levels  of  corruption  are  addressed  in  a  major  reform \nprogram  supported  by  ADB,  World  Bank,  and  other  development  partners,  and  the  Public \nProcurement  Act  was  passed  by  Parliament  in  2006.  The  Government  has  recently \ndemonstrated  strong  commitment  to  pursuing  critical  governance  reforms  with  focus  on \ncombating  corruption,  ensuring  the  effectiveness  and  independence  of  the  judiciary,  and \ndepoliticizing  the  civil  service.  It  has  already  reconstituted  the  Anticorruption  Commission  with \nnew commissioners, framed new laws to tackle corruption; taken tough legal and prosecutorial \nactions; and ratified the United Nations Convention Against Corruption.  \n \n17. \nGood  governance,  at  both  sector  and  corporate  levels,  is  invariably  emphasized  in  the \nGovernment\u2019s  various  power  sector  reform  policy  papers,  including  the  PSRB,  the  Vision  and \nPolicy  Statement  for  Power  Sector  Reforms  issued  in  2000,  and,  most  recently,  the  3-year \nsector reform road map. Among the ways sector- and corporate-level governance is addressed \nin Bangladesh\u2019s power sector are by continuing to corporatize and commercialize sector entities \nand strengthening regulatory functions. It is widely recognized that this experience to date has \nyielded positive results, and continued restructuring of the sector entities through corporatization \nand commercialization is a crucial step in promoting good governance. The amendment of the \nElectricity Act in 2006, moreover, introduced severe penalties, including imprisonment, for theft, \npilfering  electricity,  meter  tempering,  and  other  crimes.  Specific  governance  risk  mitigation \nmeasures taken in designing the proposed program are described in paras. 60\u201361. \n \n \n \nAs the Government realized that the investment requirements for the power sector would \n18. \nexceed the resources available in the public sector and could crowd out investment in other key \nsectors, it took a policy decision in 1994 to invite private sector participation in generation, and it \nintroduced  a  private  power  generation  policy  in  1996.  The  Government  made  efforts  to \nstreamline  its  administrative  and  commercial  procedures,  and  the  private  sector  responded \nfavorably. Since introduction of this policy, new capacity of 1,290 MW (in a total of seven plants) \nhas  so  far  been  established  by  IPPs.  Additional  capacity  of  about  1,400  MW  is  planned  to  be \nestablished  in  the  near  future.  In  FY2005,  IPPs 9 produced  8,185  MWh  of  electricity,  which \n\nPrivate Sector Participation  \n\n5. \n\n                                                 \n6 ADB.  2003.

ADB has consistently \nsupported  the  Government  in  promoting  private  sector  participation  in  the  power  sector, \nincluding TA for soliciting private sector implementation of the Meghnaghat Power Station.10  \n \nDespite  past  success,  Bangladesh,  like  many  other  developing  countries,  has  recently \n19. \nfaced difficulties in mobilizing further private capital for expanding power generating capacity. A \nworldwide trend shows that private investors\u2019 interest for IPPs in developing countries has fallen \noff,  and  the  number  and  value  of  transactions  involving  these  investors  are  well  below  their \npeaks  in  the  late  1990s.  Several  factors  are  generally  considered  to  have  contributed  to  the \nfalloff:  (i)  a  financial  crisis  in  1997  that  steeply  devalued  local  currencies  and  undermined  the \nsustainability  of  investments,  (ii)  conditions  in  international  capital  markets  and  a  drop  in  the \nmarket  capitalizations  of  investors\u2019  assets  that  affected  their  ability  to  raise  capital  for  new \ninvestments,  and  (iii)  concerns  about  the  stability  and  enforceability  of  legal  and  regulatory \nframeworks  under  power  sector  reform.  To  promote  further  private  sector  participation  and \npublic-private partnership in the power sector in Bangladesh, ADB has approved a TA project,11 \nwhich aims to review and analyze current hindrances to private sector participation, recommend \nmeasures to remove those impediments, and provide several public-private partnership models \nthat may be adopted in the power sector in Bangladesh.  \n \n20. \nTo  tap  local  private  capital  for  developing  the  power  sector,  the  Government  gave  its \napproval  in  March  2004  for  PGCB  to  issue,  in  one  or  more  tranches,  tax-free  bonds  with \nmaturities of 7\u201310 years and in total amount up to Tk2.0 billion to finance the local currency cost \nof  constructing  the  national  load  dispatch  center.  PGCB  appointed  an  issue  manager  in \nFebruary  2004,  then  decided  to  issue  the  bonds  in  several  tranches.  PGCB  is  now  ready  to \nissue the bonds when markets are favorable. Furthermore, in a first for the Bangladesh public \nsector, DESCO shares were directly listed on the local stock exchange in June 2006 with a very \nfavorable market response, and PGCB shares were listed in October 2006. \n \n \n \n21. \nThe major sources of external funding for the Bangladesh power sector are ADB, World \nBank,  Japan  Bank  for  International  Cooperation,  United  Kingdom  Department  for  International \nDevelopment, Kreditanstalt f\u00fcr Wiederaufbau (KfW), and USAID. ADB has assisted generation, \ntransmission,  and  distribution  of  power  in  urban  and  semi-urban  areas.  Japan  Bank  for \nInternational  Cooperation  has  concentrated  its  assistance  on  power  generation  and  rural \nelectrification  projects,  and  it  is  now  considering  to  finance  a  360  MW  power  plant  in  Haripur, \naugment  transmission  systems,  and  promote  renewable  energy.  Department  for  International \nDevelopment  has  financed  transmission  and  distribution  in  the  Dhaka  area  and  is  currently \nengaged in expanding REB. USAID has been instrumental in establishing and funding REB and \nthe  first  PBSs,  as  well  as  in  establishing  and  capacity  building  at  BERC.  USAID  continues  to \nprovide  technical  support  to  REB  and  for  making  BERC  fully  functional,  as  well  as  to  provide \nassistance  for  regional  cooperation  and  renewable  energy.  While  KfW  has  assisted  in \naugmenting  generating  capacity  and  reinforcing  transmission  projects;  it  will  emphasize \ntransmission, renewable energy, and energy efficiency. World Bank had earlier financed power \ngeneration and distribution projects in smaller towns and rural areas. Since 2002, World Bank \nhas been supporting REB in expanding its operation, and it has a plan to finance peaking power \n\nExternal Assistance and Development Partner Coordination \n\n6. \n\n                                                 \n10 ADB.  1995.

It  also  is  considering  financing  corporatization  of  BPDB\u2019s \nsouthern  zone  distribution  network,  rural  electrification,  and  renewable  energy.  External \nassistance to the power sector is summarized in Appendix 4. \n \nThere  is  an  active  energy  sector  local  consultative  group  in  Bangladesh  comprising \n22. \nrepresentatives from the development partners and Government. They meet regularly in Dhaka \nto  discuss  various  sector  issues  as  well  as  assistance  strategies  and  programs.  ADB  has,  as \nthe  lead  coordinator  of  this  consultative  group,  organized  coordination  meetings  since  1992, \nthereby contributing to the formulation of reforms and identification of reform-linked projects in \nthe sector. Most recently, in November 2005, ADB organized a coordination meeting in Dhaka \nto review the Government\u2019s reform process, provide feedback on the Government\u2019s draft 3-year \npower sector reform road map, and help the Government finalize the road map. Considering the \npower  sector\u2019s  vast  investment  requirements  and  the  complexity  of  power  sector  reforms,  the \nproposed program has been formulated in close collaboration with other development partners.  \n \n \n \n23. \nSince Bangladesh joined ADB in 1973, the power sector has received 18 public sector \nloans and one private sector investment, totaling about $1.3 billion, to improve the capacity and \nquality of power supply. ADB has also provided 22 TA grants, totaling about $14.0 million. ADB \nrecently  evaluated  its  power  sector  assistance  program12 in  Bangladesh.  It  found  that  ADB\u2019s \nassistance has been relevant, as it has addressed the sector\u2019s changing needs over time, and \nthat ADB\u2019s consistent support through reform-linked projects has been a key factor behind the \nsector\u2019s  ongoing  drive  for  commercialization,  thereby  helping  to  maintain  the  country\u2019s \nmacroeconomic stability. The evaluation also recognizes that ADB\u2019s gradual approach for sector \nreform  has  facilitated  change,  and  it  goes  on  to  recommend  sustained  support.  Still  needed, \nhowever,  are  continuing  and  more  rapid  reforms  in  creating  an  independent  regulator, \ncorporatization of BPDB and DESA, mutual independence of sector entities whose transactions \nare governed by commercial contracts, reform of  wholesale and retail tariffs to reflect costs of \nsupply, sector recapitalization, and a sound financial policy for the sector. The evaluation report \nalso concludes that, given the success of the individual projects and new sector entities, ADB\u2019s \napproach clearly indicates the direction that future reform programs should take. Another finding \nis  that  the  pace  of  privatization  in  an  environment  such  as  that  in  Bangladesh,  especially  in \ntransmission  and  distribution,  is  likely  to  be  slow.  As  such,  it  is  important  to  prioritize  reform \ninitiatives in these key areas.  \n \nIn  December  2003,  ADB  approved  two  loans  for  the  Power  Sector  Development \n24. \nProgram (PSDP),13 one program loan of $100 million, and one project loan of $186 million. The \nprogram loan was to provide support and incentives to the Government for power sector reform \nactivities  through  financial  stabilization  of  two  major  transmission  and  distribution  companies, \nnamely PGCB and DESCO, launching of BERC, optimizing generation costs on a national basis, \nand restructuring of power sector entities. The project loan was to provide financial assistance \nto expand peak load generation capacity at Siddhirganj, construct a new national load dispatch \ncenter,  and  strengthen  distribution  systems  in  northwestern  Bangladesh.  Under  the  program \nloan, two tranches of $50 million each were linked to sequenced policy reform targets. The first \ntranche was released in August 2004 and the second in December 2005 upon compliance by \n\n                                                 \n12 ADB. 2004.

Manila.  \n\n\fthe  Government  and  the  sector  entities  with  the  conditions  for  their  release.  The  PSDP  has \nbrought about numerous positive developments. A major breakthrough was the emergence of a \nnew  culture  of  accountability  for  electricity  used  by  the  Government  and  its  agencies.  This \nhelped  to  substantially  reduce  the  outstanding  dues  owed  by  the  Government  and  its \nagencies. 14  The  power  sector\u2019s  two  major  companies,  PGCB  and  DESCO,  have  become \nprofitable  organizations  since  2004.  The  PSDP  also  supported  launching  of  BERC  and  laid  a \nfoundation for restructuring the remaining key power sector entities, BPDB and DESA. While the \nGovernment has made substantial progress in meeting the overall objectives of the PSDP and \nhas complied with major loan covenants, implementation of the project loan is experiencing slow \nprogress,  particularly  in  procuring  Siddhirganj  power  station,  mainly  because  of  delays  in \nrecruiting the implementation consultant.15  \n \n \n \n25. \nIn 2000, building on the PSRB, the Government issued its Vision and Policy Statement \nfor Power Sector Reforms. This clarified specific details of the structural arrangements for power \nthe  principles  of  corporatization, \ngeneration, \ncommercialization, cost-reflective and equitable tariffs, and greater private sector participation in \ngeneration as follows:  \n \n\ntransmission  and  distribution  along  with \n\nGovernment Development Strategy \n\n8. \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n(vi) \n\nGeneration.  Separation  of  all  existing  units  through  a  corporatized  national \npower  generation  entity;  power  stations  under  construction  and  all  new  power \nstations  to  be  profit  centers  and  incorporated  as  independent  companies;  new \ngeneration to reflect a least-cost expansion plan based on the supply of private \nand public resources.  \nTransmission.  To  be  expanded  in  tandem  with  generation  capacity;  the \ntransmission grid to be owned and operated by a corporatized entity in the public \nsector (i.e., PGCB).  \nDistribution.  Creation  of  a  number  of  separate  distribution  entities  to  be \nincorporated under the Companies Act of 1994; private capital and management \nparticipation; REB to continue functioning.  \nTariffs. To be set at progressively cost-reflective levels that improve efficiency in \ngeneration, transmission, and distribution while promoting commercial returns.  \nRegulation. Regulatory commission to be established.  \nFinancial.  Restructured  entities  to  be  given  the  opportunity  to  start  operations \nwith  clean  balance  sheets;  fiscal  regime  to  be  made  neutral  irrespective  of  the \nownership structure of power entities. \n\n \n26.  As a result of these initiatives, the Government has achieved (i) creation of a competitive, \ndiverse  market  with  independent  public  and  private  generation  companies;  (ii)  restructuring  of \nthe  sector  by  transferring  all  transmission  assets  and  operations  to  a  new  transmission \ncompany; (iii) creation of a competitive environment by establishing several sector entities; and \n(iv) establishment of the energy regulatory commission, BERC. \n \nSubsequently,  in  2006,  the  Government  issued  its  3-year  reform  road  map  through \n27. \nintensive consultations with various stakeholders and key development partners. This road map \n                                                 \n14 The outstanding debts of the Government ministries and divisions were reduced by 58% from about Tk3.3 billion in \nJune 2002 to about Tk1.4 billion in December 2005. In the same period, the outstanding debts of the Government\u2019s \nautonomous and semi-autonomous bodies were reduced by 49% from about Tk6.8 billion to some Tk3.5 billion. In \nMarch 2007, these have been further reduced to Tk0.7 billion and Tk2.9 billion, respectively. \n\n15 Nevertheless, construction work of Siddhirganj power station has started in early 2007.  \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\n9. \n\nADB\u2019s Sector Strategy \n\nsets  out  the  detailed  reform  and  investment  program  for  2006\u20132008  with  a  detailed \nimplementation plan for the Government\u2019s vision statements. The 3-year road map is based on \nthe  lessons  learned  in  establishing  sector  entities,  particularly  the  need  to  introduce  new \nmanagement  structures  and  a  commercial  culture,  resolve  employee  issues,  and  provide \nsufficient autonomy and improved governance. The main results to be achieved over the next 3 \nyears  include  further  unbundling  of  electricity  supply  into  commercially  viable  generation  and \ndistribution companies. The sector road map is summarized in Appendix 5. \n \n \n \n28. \nADB has developed its strategy for the power sector in consultation with the Government \nand other key development partners involved in the sector. In parallel with its continued support \nfor  expanding  and  upgrading  power  supply  systems  in  Bangladesh  as  part  of  a  least-cost \nexpansion  plan,  the  strategy  consists  of  (i)  changes  in  the  business  environment  through \ncontinued corporatization and commercialization of sector entities as well as increasing private \nsector  participation,  (ii)  institutional  improvements  in  power  sector  entities,  (iii) creation  of  new \npower sector companies to serve as role models for the sector, (iv) enlarging the scope of PBSs, \n(v) strengthening the long-term planning and regulatory processes, and (vi) promotion of good \ngovernance at the sector and corporate levels. The proposed program addresses items (i), (ii), \n(iii),  (v),  and  (vi)  of  this  strategy.  Item  (iv)  has  been  addressed  through  ADB\u2019s  earlier  projects \nand World Bank\u2019s ongoing project for rural electrification. \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED SECTOR DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n \nA. \n \n29. \nThe  proposed  Sustainable  Power  Sector  Development  Program  (the  Program)  is \nexpected to promote sustained economic growth in Bangladesh by providing improved capacity \nin the nation\u2019s power sector and reliable power supply to its people. The Program supports the \nGovernment\u2019s goal of providing reliable electricity to the entire country by 2020. Building on the \nsuccess  of  the  first  power  sector  development  program,  approved  in  2003  (footnote  13),  and \nconsistent  with  ADB\u2019s  country  strategy  and  program,16 the  proposed  program  aims  to  provide \nfurther  support  and  incentives  to  the  Government  for  power  sector  reform  through  financially \nstabilizing  sector  entities  and  improving  their  governance  while  assisting  to  expand  clean-fuel \npower  generation  capacity,  enhancing  transmission  network  reliability  and  efficiency,  and \nimproving quality of supply in Dhaka city and surrounding areas (the major power market). The \nProgram which is a high priority for the Government, is linked to the Government\u2019s sector reform \nroad map and is part of the least-cost development plan for the power sector.  \n \nB. \n \n30. \nSustainable  Sector  Development.  The  Program,  comprised  of  a  program  loan  and \nproject loan, is designed to promote sustained development of the power sector in Bangladesh \nby  pursuing  (i)  improved  sector  and  corporate  governance  through  further  corporatization  and \ncommercialization  of  the  sector  entities  and  other  good  governance  measures;  (ii)  enhanced \nfinancial health of sector entities to be achieved by implementing a financial restructuring plan \nand reducing accounts receivable; (iii) improved operational efficiency of the sector entities by \nreducing  overall  system  losses  with  investments  in  generation,  transmission,  and  distribution \n\nImportant Features \n\n                                                 \n16 ADB. 2005.

The  Government  intends  to \naccelerate the reform process by implementing a time-bound power sector reform action plan to \nhelp  achieve  sustained  economic  growth  and  poverty  reduction.  Towards  this  goal,  the \nproposed program will assist the Government to (i) develop and implement a time-bound sector \nreform action plan by preparing a detailed reform road map and engaging a regular monitoring \nsystem  for  the  reform  process,  (ii)  develop  a  long-term  power  system  master  plan  for \ntransmission and distribution as well as a strategy paper for a rural electrification program, and \n(iii) develop a sector-wide, medium-term capacity development program.  \n \n \n \n34. \nEstablishing  a  fully  functioning  legal  and  regulatory  framework  is  crucial  to  successful \nreform,  and  the  Government  has  taken  the  most  fundamental  step  by  establishing  BERC  in \n2004. BERC will need to address a number of complicated issues during the reform process to \nensure  sustained  sector  growth.  The  proposed  program  seeks  to  assist  the  Government  and \nBERC  in  this  effort  by  setting  out  specific  policy  actions:  (i)  appointment  of  the  remaining \ncommission member of BERC, (ii) approval of a BERC organogram by the relevant authorities \nof  the  Government  to  enable  staff  recruitment  (footnote  3),  and  (iii)  gazette  notification  of \nvarious rules and regulations to build a firm platform for BERC businesses.  \n \n \n \n35. \nThe  financial  position  of  the  power  sector  entities  has  been  enhanced  in  recent  years, \nexcept  for  BPDB  and  DESA,  owing  to  various  reform  processes  supported  by  ADB  and  other \ndevelopment  partners.  PGCB  and  DESCO,  in  particular,  became  profitable  organizations.  To \nhelp  improve  the  financial  position  of  BPDB  and  DESA,  a  financial  restructuring  plan  was \nprepared under ADB TA4379-BAN. It called for cleaning up their balance sheets by writing off \n\nFully Functioning Legal and Regulatory Framework  \n\nFinancial Health of Power Sector Entities \n\nb. \n\nc. \n\n \n\n \n\n11 \n\n \n\n\f \n\nd. \n\nFurther Restructuring of Power Sector Entities  \n\nunrecoverable  cross-debts  between  sector  entities  and  converting  to  equity  unsustainable \noverdue  debt  service  and  long-term  loans  payable  to  the  Government.  The  Government  has \nrecently  drafted  a  time-bound  financial  restructuring  plan  for  these  entities.  The  proposed \nprogram  supports  this  effort  by  specifying  policy  actions  needed  to  facilitate  approval  of  the \nfinancial restructuring plan by the relevant authorities by the Government.  \n \n36. \nSo far, BPDB and DESA have been meeting the liabilities for terminal benefits including \npension and gratuities of its employees from revenues, rather than on the basis of a funded trust \nor scheme. As a result, a significant part of the terminal benefit liabilities are unfunded. Although \na few new companies have recently emerged in the power sector, the corporatization process is \nbeing halted due to unfunded pension obligations and gratuities, which are estimated at about \n$163 million. It is inevitable that this issue must be addressed to accelerate the reform process.   \n \n37. \nAs  a  result  of  extensive  policy  dialogue  between  the  Government  and  development \npartners,  and  especially  owing  to  the  support  of  ADB\u2019s  PSDP,  the  accounts  receivable  of  the \npower  sector  entities  as  of  December  2005  have  been  reduced  to  a  level  of  3.8  times  the \nmonthly  average  billing.  However,  the  accounts  receivable  owed  by  the  Government  and  its \nautonomous and semiautonomous bodies are still high. As of December 2005, the outstanding \ndues  owed  by  the  Government  ministries  and  divisions  were  Tk1.4  billion,  or  6.0  times  the \nmonthly average billing to them, while the amount owed by the Government\u2019s autonomous and \nsemiautonomous  bodies  was  Tk3.5  billion  or  12.7  times  the  monthly  average  bills.  There  is  a \nneed to further reduce the accounts receivable owed by the Government and its bodies.   \n \n \n \n38. \nADB\u2019s PSDP (footnote 13) laid a foundation for further restructuring of the power sector \nby  establishing  several  new  entities  under  the  Companies  Act,  such  as  Electricity  Generation \nCompany  of  Bangladesh  Limited  (EGCB),  DPDC,  and  North  West  Zone  Power  Distribution \nCompany  Limited  (NWZPDC).  The  program  loan  will  facilitate  downstream  activities  for \ncorporatizing  these  entities  by  helping  constitute  the  board  of  directors,  appoint  management, \nand transfer operations to the new companies.    \n \n \n \n39. \nSince  adoption  of  its  policy  in  1996  to  promote  private  sector  participation  in  power \ngeneration, the Government has succeeded in attracting foreign private capital. At present, the \nprivate sector supplies about 38% of the nation\u2019s total generation, which is the most successful \ncase  in  the  region.  As  discussed  above  (para.  19),  however,  Bangladesh  has  recently \nencountered difficulties in attracting private capital. While ADB provides TA to promote private \nsector participation and public-private partnerships in the sector, the program loan will address \nthe  issue  by  helping  the  Government  establish  an  enabling  environment  through  fully \noperationalizing  the  BERC,  further  corporatizing  and  commercializing  the  sector  entities,  and \nlisting  PGCB  and  DESCO  shares  in  the  local  stock  market.  This  will  instill  private  sector \nconfidence and encourage its gradual participation in the power sector. \n \n \n \n40. \nThe  Government  has  requested  a  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to  $60  million \nfrom  ADB\u2019s  Special  Fund  resources  (Asian  Development  Fund)  to  help  finance  the  Program. \nThe loan will have a term of 24 years, including a grace period of 8 years, and an interest rate of \n1% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter.  \n\nPromoting Private Sector Partnership and Public-Private Partnership \n\nFinancing Plan \n\n3. \n\ne. \n\n \n\n12 \n\n \n\n\f4. \n\nCounterpart Funds \n\n \n \n \n \nThe  counterpart  funds  to  be  generated  from  the  proceeds  of  the  program  loan  will  be \n41. \nused to finance the adjustment costs associated with the Program, including funding unfunded \npension obligations and gratuities as well as to settle outstanding dues of the Government and \nits autonomous and semiautonomous bodies.

The  Power  Division  of  MPEMR  will  execute  part  E.  Until \nsuch time as NWPGC and DPDC can take over project implementation, BPDB and DESA will \nassist and carry out all necessary steps and actions to prepare for and facilitate implementation \nof their respective components. The EAs and Power Division of MPEMR will be responsible for \nsupervising project implementation and monitoring of project operational performance. \n \n \n \n56. \nThe  project  will  be  implemented  over  a  42-month  period.  Implementation  has \ncommenced  in  July  2006  with  preparation  of  requests  for  proposals  for  recruitment  of \nimplementation consultants and draft bidding documents by the EAs, and it will be completed by \nDecember 2009. The implementation schedule of the project loan is presented in Appendix 9. \n \n \n \n57. \nProcurement  of  goods  and  services  to  be  financed  under  the  investment  components \nwill be carried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from \ntime to time). For such procurement, bid specifications will be prepared in a manner to ensure \nmaximum  competition  under  international  competitive  bidding.  A  third-party  pre-shipment \ninspection  provision  will  be  adopted  to  ensure  quality  of  goods  and  equipments.  In  order  to \nencourage  local  industry,  contracts  estimated  to  cost  less  than  $500,000  for  equipment  and \nrelated  services,  and  less  than  $1,000,000  for  works,  may  be  procured  following  national \ncompetitive  bidding  (NCB)  procedures  while  allowing  foreign  firms  also  to  participate.  Before \ncommencement  of  NCB  procurement,  ADB  and  the  Borrower  will  review  the  Borrower\u2019s \nprocurement  procedures  to  ensure  consistency  with  ADB  requirements.  Any  necessary \nmodifications  or  clarifications  to  the  Borrower\u2019s  procedures  will  be  documented  in  the \nprocurement plan. ADB\u2019s domestic preference scheme may be utilized. A detailed procurement \nplan is in Appendix 10.  \n \n\nProcurement \n\nc. \n\n \n\nd. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n \n58. \nInternational  and  national  consultants  will  assist  BPDB  and  its  successor  generation \ncompany (NWPGC) for part A and PGCB for part B in preparing bidding documents, including \nbasic design, evaluating bids, and project implementation supervision that includes approval of \nfinal  design,  as  well  as  the  Power  Division  of  MPEMR  in  capacity  development.19 All  of  these \n\n                                                 \n18 Before  loan  effectiveness,  the  Government  will  establish  this  new  company  under  the  Companies  Act  1994,  as \n\n19 While there are some consulting services budgeted for parts C and D, these will be funded by the EAs and are not \n\ndirectly connected to the components funded by ADB.  \n\namended. \n\n \n\n\f \n\ne. \n\nconsultants  will  be  recruited  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants \n(2007, as amended from time to time). For parts A and B, the simplified technical proposals and \nquality- and cost-based selection method will be used. For Part E, the quality- and cost-based \nselection  method  and  the  simplified  technical  proposals  or  biodata  technical  proposals  will  be \nused.  \n \nConsulting  services  required  for  part  A  are  estimated  at  34  person-months  of \n59. \ninternational  and  72  person-months  of  national  consultants  with  expertise \nin  design, \nconstruction,  testing,  and  commissioning  of  gas-fired  power  generating  plants.  Consulting \nservices for part B are estimated at 38 person-months of international and 60 person-months of \nnational consultants with expertise in design, construction, testing, and commissioning of 400-\nkV  transmission  line  and  gas-insulated  switchyard  substations.  Consulting  services  for  part  E \nare  estimated  at  150  person-months  of  international  and  200  person-months  of  national \nconsultants  with  expertise  in  various  areas  including  corporate  and  financial  management, \ninformation  and  communication  technology,  long-term  system  planning,  governance,  research \nand  development,  and  human  resource  development.  The  outline  terms  of  reference  for  the \nconsulting services are provided in Supplementary Appendix E.  \n \n \n \nThe  Program  is  designed  to  improve  sector-level  good  governance  by  improving \n60. \npredictability  (long-term  planning,  codification  of  rules  and  regulations,  and  independence  of \nregulatory  processes),  transparency  (systematic  dissemination  of  relevant  sector  information \nand  discussions  on  issues  before  decisions  are  made),  and  accountability  (establishing  the \ncause-effect structure of incentives). It is expected that the governance at the sector level will be \nimproved when the sector is fully reorganized as corporate entities and BERC is fully functional, \nas this will ensure predictability, transparency, and accountability in the business process. At the \ncorporate level, governance will be enhanced by the continued introduction of a new corporate \nculture  through  corporatization;  independence  of  each  entity\u2019s  board  of  directors  from  the \nGovernment; introduction of market-oriented incentive packages for staff of corporatized entities; \ndefined  delegation  of  powers  to  staff;  expansion  of  computerized  billing,  accounting  and \nmanagement  information  systems;  use  of  prepaid  meters;  and  commercialization  of  activities. \nFurthermore, the Government has implemented an operational risk mitigation action plan, which \nwas jointly prepared jointly by the World Bank, ADB, and other development partners to address \nkey governance risks and weaknesses. Moreover, since 1 January 2007, the Government and \nADB are undertaking a joint operational risk assessment in coordination with other development \npartners in such high risk sectors as the power sector.

Consistent with its commitment to good governance, \naccountability,  and  transparency,  ADB  reserves  the  right  to  investigate,  directly  or  through  its \nagents, any allegedly corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the Program. \nTo  support  these  efforts,  relevant  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s  policy  on  Anticorruption  are  included  in \nthe  loan  regulations  and  bidding  documents.  In  particular,  all  contracts  financed  by  ADB  in \nconnection with the investment components shall include provisions specifying the right of ADB \nto  audit  and  examine  the  records  and  accounts  of  the  EAs  and  all  contractors,  suppliers, \nconsultants, and other service providers as they relate to the Program. \n \n \n \n62. \nAll the EAs have sufficient experience in procuring materials for the works entrusted to \nthem under previous investment loans and were allowed to initiate advance action in July 2006. \nAll  the  EAs  have  commenced  advance  action  by  preparing  draft  requests  for  proposals  for \nrecruiting  implementation  consultants  and  draft  bidding  documents  for  procurement.  The \nGovernment  has  been  advised  that  ADB\u2019s  approval  of  advance  action  on  procurement  and \nrecruitment  of  consultants  does  not  commit  ADB  to  subsequently  approve  the  project  or  to \nfinance the recruitment and procurement costs.

Since the disbursements under both project loans will be mainly for procuring goods and \nservices, ADB\u2019s commitment letter and direct payment procedures will be utilized.  \n \n \n \n64. \nThe accounting, auditing, and reporting systems and procedures for the project loans will \nbe established in accordance with accounting principles and practices satisfactory to ADB. The \nEAs  will  maintain  separate  accounts  for  the  project  components.  Independent  auditors  whose \nqualifications,  experience,  and  terms  of  reference  are  acceptable  to  ADB  will  audit  the  project \naccounts and related financial statements annually. Certified copies in English of such audited \naccounts and financial statements of each EA will be submitted to ADB not later than 6 months \nafter the end of the financial year to which they relate. All EAs were informed about ADB\u2019s policy \non submitting audited financial statements and possible penalties for delayed submission.  \n \n \n \nEach EA will prepare separate progress reports for its respective component and submit \n65. \nthese to ADB on a quarterly basis within 20 days from the end of each quarter. Each report will \nprovide  a  narrative  description  of  progress  made  during  the  period,  changes  in  the \nimplementation  schedule,  problems  or  difficulties  encountered,  the  performance  of  the  project \nimplementation consultants, and the work to be carried out in the next period. A progress report \nwill  also  include  a  summary  financial  account  for  the  project  loan  components,  consisting  of \nproject  expenditures  for  the  year  to  date  and  total  expenditure  to  date.  Performance  will  be \nevaluated based on indicators and targets stipulated in the design and monitoring framework.  \n \n \n \n66. \nADB  will  field  an  inception  mission  within  3  months  of  the  Program  approval.  ADB  will \nreview  the  implementation  and  operation  of  the  Program  based  on  the  quarterly  progress \nreports  and  meet  with  the  EAs  and  the  Government  semiannually  to  discuss  implementation \nprogress. A midterm review will be carried out 2 years after the loan effectiveness, focusing on \nthe  engineering,  resettlement,  and  environmental  aspects  of  the  ADB  supported  investments \nand  reviewing  the  financial  status  of  the  EAs.  A  project  completion  report  will  be  submitted  to \nADB within 3 months following completion of the individual parts of the investment loan.  \n \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\nProject Review \n\nj. \n\n \n\nIV. \n\nPROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\n1. \n\nProgram Loan \n\nExpected Benefits \n\nA. \n \n \n \n67. \nThe  program  loan  will  help  improve  sustainability  of  the  power  sector  by  implementing \nnational  action  plans  for  power  sector  reforms;  financially  stabilizing  BPDB  and  DESA; \nstrengthening  the  policy,  legal,  and  regulatory  framework;  and  promoting  private  sector \nparticipation.

A  major  portion  of  the \nProgram  is  also  geared  towards  establishing  the  financial  soundness  of  BPDB\u2019s  and  DESA\u2019s \nsuccessor companies so that they can commence operations on a sound financial base. As the \nprogram loan component is mainly related to financial and organizational restructuring of power \nsector entities, it has not been considered in the economic or financial analysis. \n \n \n \n \n \n68. \nThe  economic  internal  rates  of  return  (EIRRs)  were  calculated  for  each  part  of  the \nproject loan. These range from 14.4% to 42.4% and compare favorably with the opportunity cost \nof capital of 12% per annum. The combined EIRR for all the project components was estimated \nat  28.9%.  The  EIRRs  were  also  subjected  to  a  sensitivity  analysis  of  key  variables.  The  key \nvariables tested were (i) a 10% increase in capital costs, (ii) a fuel price rise of 10%, (iii) a 10% \nincrease  in  operation  and  maintenance  costs,  (iv)  a  benefits  decrease  of  10%,  and  (v)  a \ncombination  of  all  variables.  Sensitivity  analysis  indicates  that  the  EIRRs  for  each  part  of  the \nproject  loan  and  the  project  overall  are  robust  under  most  conditions.  The  detailed  economic \nevaluation and sensitivity analysis are given in Supplementary Appendix F. \n \n \n \n69. \nUsing  financial  management  assessment  questionnaires  and  field  interview,  financial \nmanagement assessments were undertaken for each EA to evaluate its ability to undertake and \nfulfill ADB\u2019s fiduciary requirements for the project components. The EAs\u2019 financial management \nwas found to be acceptable. Project implementation delays are expected to be minimized since \nthese entities are already exposed to and familiar with ADB procedures and requirements.  \n \n \n \n70. \nFinancial  projections  were  prepared  for  each  EA  under  the  assumption  that  the  new \nentities  will  take  over  operation  of  BPDB  in  part  and  of  DESA  in  its  entirety  during  the \nconstruction  phase.  Financial  projections,  including  projected  operating  and  financial  ratios, \nhave been prepared in nominal terms. Estimates of operation and maintenance costs consider \nimprovements  in  efficiency  from  optimally  sized  systems  compared  with  the  existing  system. \nFinancial projections also assume better cash flow management, including improved collection \nratios to be achieved under the Program. From FY2009, all EAs are expected to meet cash flow \nas well as operating requirements, meet full debt service obligations, and maintain a minimum \n1.2 debt service ratio. Detailed financial performance and projections for the EAs are provided in \nSupplementary Appendix G. \n \n71. \nFinancial  evaluation  was  completed  for  parts  A  through  D  of  the  project  loan  in  real \nterms  using  constant  2006  prices.  The  project  cost  estimates  and  financial  projections  in \nnominal terms were converted to real terms by adjusting for the projected effects of foreign and \ndomestic  inflation  and  currency  fluctuation.  Incremental  costs  and  benefits  were  derived  by \nevaluating  the  financial  position  of  the  EAs  under  with-  and  without-project  scenarios.  The \naverage  financial  internal  rate  of  return  (FIRR),  computed  on  an  after-tax  basis,  ranges  from \n6.1%  to  12.4%.  This  compares  favorably  with  the  weighted  average  cost  of  capital,  also \ncomputed on an after-tax basis, of 2.9% on an aggregate basis. All parts of the project loan are \nconsidered both financially viable and sustainable.

The combined interventions \nof the proposed program loan and project loan are strongly interlinked and will result in various \nindirect social benefits. Improved financial management from corporatizing and commercializing \nsector  entities,  along  with  independent  tariff  rulings,  will  benefit  all  consumer  categories. \nCommercialization  will  improve  corporate  governance,  decrease  corruption,  reduce  system \nlosses, and allow the Government to realize savings that can be directed to social sectors. \n \n73. \nThe Program will bring about numerous benefits in the project areas. These include that \n(i) all consumers will be supplied power reliably and with improved quality, (ii) commercial and \nindustrial  operations  will  run  more  smoothly  owing  to  reduced  load  shedding,  (iii)  low  voltage \nproblems  will  diminish,  (iv)  replacing  old  lines  with  insulated  ones  will  improve  public  safety. \nElectricity will be supplied to any group that requests new connection or increased supply. New \nconsumers  to  be  connected  under  the  Program  are  estimated  to  be  about  230,000  in  Dhaka \narea comprising domestic, commercial, irrigation, industrial and other consumer categories, and \nthe  incremental  power  supplies  from  the  Program  will  be  sufficient  to  serve  at  least  6  million \nconsumers at current per capita generation rates. The Program will also directly benefit 820,000 \nexisting consumers in Dhaka area by providing improved quality of power supply. \n \n74. \nThe  improvement  in  the  power  distribution  system  will  benefit  all,  including  the  poor, \nwomen,  and  children.  A  reliable  and  improved  quality  power  supply  will  increase  employment \nopportunities  and  incomes.  Many  businesses  in  the  country  have  been  affected  by  frequent \npower  outages,  including  garment  factories,  which  employ  several  million  poor  people, \nparticularly  poor  women.  A  stable  power  supply  will  increase  stability  in  manufacturing  and \nservices  processes  and  boost  enterprises\u2019  productivity.  A  large  part  of  the  available  labor  in \nurban areas like Dhaka are poor migrant workers from rural areas; the increased employment \nopportunities for these laborers will add to the remittances they make to their homes, helping to \nreduce poverty in the rural areas and increase their welfare.  \n \nThe  poor,  and  especially  women,  are  disproportionately  affected  by  power  losses  and \n75. \nunstable  power  supply  leading  to  low  income  and  long  working  hours.  Health  clinics  and \ndiagnostic services are also seriously disrupted, as many units become nonoperational due to \nlow voltage or have shortened service lives because of constant power outages. Water supply \nand streetlights are of poor quality due to power disruption. Better power supply provided by the \nProgram is expected to improve facilities and services. The Program will reduce waiting times \ndue  to  power  outages,  equipment  loss  through  low  voltage,  and  the  constant  potential  for \nimpairment  of  emergency  services  through  load  shedding.  An  indirect,  but  significant  positive \ndevelopment  impact  is  envisaged  through  availability  of  light  for  education,  improved  water \nsupply, diagnostic and health services etc. Children and students will benefit from longer study \nhours, information technology-based learning, and communications opportunities. The summary \npoverty reduction and social strategy for the Program is presented in Appendix 11. \n \n \n \n\n23 \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\ne. \n\n(ii) \n\nEnvironmental Analysis \n\nInvoluntary Resettlement and Indigenous Peoples \n\n \n \n76. \nAll project components have been sited and designed to minimize land acquisition and \nresettlement  impacts.  Part  A  of  the  project  loan  will  have  no  resettlement  impact  because  the \nsites have already been developed by the EA, including associated auxiliaries, switchyards, and \nconnections  to  the  national  transmission  grid.  Part  B  will  have  some  resettlement  impacts \nrelated  to  right-of-way  clearance  and  land  acquisition  for  new  substations.  Parts  C  and  D  will \nhave  minor  impacts  related  to  land  acquisition  for  new  substations,  expansion  of  existing \nsubstations,  and  new  33  kV  lines  in  the  Dhaka  area.  The  impacts  of  parts  C  and  D  will  be \nminimized  to  the  extent  possible  by  installing  power  cables  underground  beneath  medians  of \nexisting  roads.  Substations  under  parts  C  and  D  will  be  built  on  government  land  wherever \npossible.  Attached  plots  are  walled  or  fenced,  and  therefore  no  risk  of  encroachments  is \nanticipated.  A  summary  resettlement  plan  (RP)  is  given  in  Appendix  12,  while  the  full \nresettlement plan is provided in Supplementary Appendix I. \n \n77. \nNo  impact  is  foreseen  on  indigenous  peoples,  although  special  provisions  have  been \nmade in the RP to ensure they are not discriminated against, particularly in land compensation. \nIndigenous  groups  in  Bangladesh  are  not  usually  subject  to  discrimination  based  on  ethnicity, \nreligion,  or  other  grounds.  Vulnerability  relates  to  groups  other  than  indigenous  peoples, \nparticularly those living in extreme poverty and women. The RP has provisions for these groups.  \n \n \n \n78. \nAll  parts  of  the  project  loan  are  assigned  to  category  B  under  ADB\u2019s  Environmental \nGuidelines.  Rapid  environmental  assessments  were  conducted  for  all  proposed  components. \nField  visits  and \nincluding  an  environmental \nmanagement plan, were conducted. A summary IEE for the overall Program is in Appendix 13. \nEnvironmental  and  social  benefits  will  occur  due  to  use  of  clean  natural  gas  for  power \ngeneration  (replacing  diesel  generating  sets,  traditional  wood  fuel,  and  agricultural  biomass \nenergy),  improved  power  system  efficiency  via  peak-shaving  and  new  transmission  and \ndistribution  capacity,  and  reduced  aggregate  technical  and  commercial  losses  via  system \nupgrades. Environmental benefits include improved air quality, reduced regional pollutant loads, \nand offsetting growth in greenhouse gas emissions. Negative environmental impacts have been \nminimized  through  careful  project  design  and  can  be  mitigated  cost-effectively.  Overall  project \nbenefits outweigh negative impacts. \n \nB. \n \n79. \nPolitical  Commitment.  The  Program\u2019s  success  depends  on  the  Government\u2019s  strong \ncommitment to power sector reforms in general and, more specifically, to successfully creating a \nnew  power  generation  company  to  implement  part  A  and  transferring  operational  authority  for \nDESA area to DPDC to implement part C. There is risk these actions may be affected by future \npolitical developments. However, this risk is considered low and may be mitigated by continued \npolicy dialogue, as the Government has shown consistent commitment to power sector reforms \nsince  adopting  the  PSRB  in  1994.  Moreover,  the  sector  has  comprehensive  experience  from \nprevious  projects  in  setting  up  new  companies  and  transferring  operational  authority.  The \nsuccess  of  the  sector's  corporatized  entities  clearly  indicates  the  direction  of  reform,  which  is \nwidely recognized by various stakeholders. \n \n80. \nRegulatory  Capacity.  The Bangladesh Energy Regulatory Commission Act, 2003 was \npassed  by  Parliament  to  give  the  regulatory  body  a  wider  mandate  and  independence.  Since \n\ninitial  environmental  examinations  (IEEs), \n\nRisks and Safeguards \n\n24 \n\n \n\n\fthis  Act  provides  the  legal  framework  for  an  independent  BERC  to  operate,  it  is  now  the \nGovernment\u2019s  responsibility  to  ensure  that  regulatory  actions  are  taken  based  on  commercial \nprinciples  and  without  outside  interference.  Given  its  central  role  in  various  sector  reform \nactivities, BERC should be able to undertake its mandate with adequate human resources and \nan  operating  budget.  The  proposed  program  will  facilitate  the  Government\u2019s  action  in  making \nBERC fully operational. The Program also complements USAID activities in preparing detailed \nrules and regulations for licensing and tariff settings based on commercial principles.  \n \nGood  Governance.  Good  governance  is  an  essential  precondition  for  sustainable \n81. \npower sector development in Bangladesh. The Government has placed good governance at the \ncenter  of  power  sector  reform  policies.  The  Program  design  includes  specific  measures  to \nreduce risk of corruption and improve governance (paras. 60\u201361). \n \n82. \nProject Readiness. Previous ADB-financed projects in the power sector in Bangladesh \nhave  experienced  frequent  delays  in  project  implementation,  largely  due  to  poor  front-end \nproject  preparation  by  the  EAs,  particularly  in  obtaining  government  approvals  for  projects\u2019 \ncomponents  proposals,  slow  progress  in  land  acquisition,  and  cumbersome  procurement \nprocedures, coupled with delays in formulating project teams. The EAs and Government have \nundertaken  various  actions  to  accelerate  project  implementation.  The  EAs  already  have \nappointed all the project teams including project directors; the development project proposals for \nall  the  investment  components  have  been  approved  by  the  Government.  Land  acquisition  for \nconstruction of the project components has also been completed or is in an advanced stage. As \nall  the  project  components  will  be  implemented  by  corporatized  entities,  an  accelerated \nprocurement process is anticipated since the decisions can be made by the respective boards \nof  directors  without  referring  them  to  the  Government.  Moreover,  a  number  of  draft  bidding \ndocuments  for  procuring  goods  and  services  and  draft  requests  for  proposals  for  recruiting \nimplementation  consultants  have  already  been  submitted  to  ADB  by  the  EAs,  and  several \nbidding  documents  have  been  issued  to  accelerate  the  front-end  activities.  Supplementary \nAppendix J presents the status on the project readiness.  \n \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n \n83. \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents. \n \nA. \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\n \n\nAdministrative \n\n1. \n \n84. \nThe Government will ensure that the policies adopted and actions taken, as described in \nthe development policy letter and the policy matrix, continue in effect during the program period \nand  subsequently.

operations  immediately  after  independence  in \n1. \n1972 with creation of the Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB), upon restructuring of \nEast  Pakistan  Water  and  Power  Development  Authority,  as  the  sole  utility  responsible  for  all \ngeneration,  transmission,  and  distribution.  In  1977,  the  Rural  Electrification  Board  (REB)  was \ncreated to undertake electrification in rural Bangladesh. Since its creation, BPDB\u2019s commercial \nperformance has been weak. In 1991, to address this situation, the Government split up BPDB\u2019s \noperations  and  created  a  new  distribution  entity,  the  Dhaka  Electric  Supply  Authority  (DESA). \nDESA was given responsibility for power distribution in the Greater Dhaka area. However, as all \nof  DESA\u2019s  assets  and  personnel  were  transferred  over  from  BPDB  without  any  changes  in \nbusiness culture, the power sector faced continuing commercial failure. Recognizing the need to \nimprove the sector\u2019s performance the Government, in consultation with the major development \npartners,1 adopted a policy paper in 1994 entitled Power Sector Reforms in Bangladesh (PSRB). \nThe PSRB outlined the reform process to gradually remove constraints in the sector through (i) \nseparating  sector  regulation  and  operation;  (ii)  creating  autonomy  and  commercial  orientation \namong  the  sector  entities;  (iii)  unbundling  generation,  transmission,  and  distribution;  and  (iv) \nincreasing private sector participation. Subsequently, in 2000, the Government issued its Vision \nand  Policy  Statement  for  Power  Sector  Reforms  that  further  clarified  specific  details  of  the \nstructural  changes  in  generation,  transmission,  and  distribution  along  with  the  principles  of \ncorporatization and commercialization. In 2006, the Government issued a 3-year road map for \npower  sector  reforms  to  undertake  further  organizational  restructuring  toward  improving \ncorporate governance and promoting commercialization.  \n \n2. \nAs  a  result  of  implementing  the  reform  policy,  several  new  public  sector  entities  have \nbeen established and made operational. These include the Power Grid Company of Bangladesh \nLimited (PGCB), the Dhaka Electric Supply Company Limited (DESCO), the West Zone Power \nDistribution Company Limited (WZPDC), the Ashuganj Power Station Company Limited (APSC), \nand  the  Electricity  Generation  Company  of  Bangladesh  Limited  (EGCB).  In  addition,  private \nsector independent power producers (IPPs), including the Rural Power Company Limited (RPC), \nhave  been  established  and  started  operation.  PGCB  has  taken  over  all  BPDB\u2019s  transmission \nassets  and  most  of  DESA\u2019s  transmission  assets.  DESCO  has  secured  DESA\u2019s  distribution \nassets  in  the  Mirpur  and  Gulshan  Circles  of  Dhaka.  WZPDC  and  APSC  have  taken  over \nBPDB\u2019s  distribution  assets  in  the  west  and  generation  assets  in  the  Ashuganj  Power  Station, \nrespectively.  Moreover,  70  rural  electric  cooperatives  (PBSs)\u2014organized,  initially  funded,  and \nmonitored by REB\u2014are in charge of power distribution in most rural areas. DESA\u2019s area outside \nDhaka  city  was  transferred  to  eight  PBSs.  In  2005,  the  Dhaka  Power  Distribution  Company \nLimited  (DPDC)  and  North  West  Zone  Power  Distribution  Company  Limited  (NWZPDC), \nrespectively,  were  established  to  take  over  the  distribution  assets  of  DESA\u2019s  and  BPDB\u2019s \nnorthwest  zone  power  distribution  network,  respectively.  The  Bangladesh  Energy  Regulatory \nCommission  (BERC)  was  established  in  April  2004  as  an  independent  regulatory  body  under \nthe  Bangladesh  Energy  Regulatory  Commission  Act,  2003  to  regulate  energy  businesses \nincluding  the  power  sector.  The  Government,  through  the  Power  Division  of  the  Ministry  of \nPower,  Energy  and  Mineral  Resources  (MPEMR),  wholly  owns  and  supervises  BPDB,  DESA, \nand REB.

Coal reserves, which are located in the northwest, \nare deep beneath the surface and difficult to develop. One potential mine with a limited output of \nabout  1  million  tons  per  annum  is  being  developed  with  external  assistance  to  feed  2x125 \nmegawatt  (MW)  power  plants,  and  a  study  is  being  undertaken  to  review  feasibility  for \ndevelopment  of  another  coalmine  in  the  northwest.  The  country's  entire  proven  recoverable \nreserves of oil (including condensate) are estimated at 59 million barrels. Although Bangladesh \nhas  had  some  successes  in  small-scale  development  of  renewable  resources,  these  are \nperipheral to the issue of generating bulk electricity for the main grid. Bangladesh is, however, \nwell endowed with natural gas. In fact, natural gas is the only significant source of commercial \nenergy in Bangladesh. At present, about 85% of the power generation capacity in the country is \ngas  based,  10%  is  based  on  imported  fuel,  and  5%  is  hydro.  In  terms  of  energy  generated, \n\n \n\n\f38 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nabout  90%  of  the  total  in  fiscal  year  (FY)  2005  is  from  gas-fired  power  plants.  Present  gas \nreserves and production are considered adequate to serve the existing power plants, and it is \nhighly probable that additional reserves could be developed to serve the needs of those power \nplants projected until 2025.  \n \n4. \nOver  the  last  10  years,  consumption  of  electricity  in  Bangladesh  grew  at  an  average \ncompound  annual  rate  of  8.1%,  and  it  is  expected  that  demand  for  electricity  will  grow  at  an \nannual  rate  of  about  8.0%  for  the  next  10  years.  The  ADB  funded  power  system  master  plan \nupdate  projected  that  a  total  capacity  expansion  of  17,900  MW  would  be  necessary  through \n2025, of which 3,500 MW would be needed by 2010.2 Figure A2.2 shows the projected annual \nand cumulative capacity additions from 2005 through 2025. \n \n\nFigure A2.2: Planned Generation Capacity Additions through 2025 \n\nExisting and committed\n\n150 MW Simple Cycle Gas Turbine\n\n450 MW Combined Cycle\n\n700 MW Combined Cycle\n\nPeak Load\n\n25,000\n\n20,000\n\n15,000\n\n10,000\n\n5,000\n\nW\nM\n\n \n,\n\ny\nt\ni\nc\na\np\na\nC\nd\ne\n\n \n\nl\nl\n\na\nt\ns\nn\n\nI\n\n0\n\n2005\n\n2007\n\n2009\n\n2011\n\n2013\n\n2015\n\n2017\n\n2019\n\n2021\n\n2023\n\n2025\n\n \n\nMW = megawatts \nSource: Power sector entities.\n\nTransmission System Expansion \n\nThe  transmission  system  within  Bangladesh  is  the  responsibility  of  PGCB,  which  was \n5. \nestablished  by  separating  BPDB\u2019s  transmission  assets  and  commenced  operations  in  1996. \nThe highest voltage level of PGCB\u2019s transmission system is 230 kilovolt (kV), with transmission \nlines  structured  as  a  230  kV  loop  around  Dhaka  with  radial  extension  to  the  western  part  of \nBangladesh  and  the  southern  region  in  the  Chittagong  area.  The  132  kV  system  extends \nradially  from  Dhaka  to  the  central  and  southern  regions.  Similarly,  the  northern  and  western \nregions  in  the  western  part  of  the  country  are  interconnected  through  132  kV  lines.  Currently, \nPGCB  owns  1,436  circuit-km  of  230  kV  transmission  lines  and  4,868  circuit-km  of  132  kV \ntransmission lines, with transmission capacity of 3,925 megavolt-amperes (MVA).  \n \n6. \nThe  power  system  master  plan  update\u2019s  least-cost  expansion  plan  concluded  that \nadditional  transmission  capacity  of  4,875  MVA  of  230/132  kV  transformers  will  be  required  by \n2010  and  another  4,650  MVA  by  2015,  along  with  corresponding  transmission  lines.  While \nPGCB  has  undertaken  to  mobilize  investment  capital  through  various  measures,  including \nissuing  corporate  bonds  and  off-loading  its  stock,  as  approved  by  the  Government,  the \nproposed investment support from the Asian Development Bank will be critical to this goal.  \n\n                                                 \n2  ADB.  2004.

At  present, \nseveral  entities  are  involved  in  the  power  distribution  business  in  Bangladesh.  DESA 3 and \nDESCO  are  covering  Dhaka  areas,  while  PBSs  cover  most  rural  areas  and  BPDB  primarily \ncovers  urban  areas  outside  Dhaka.  WZPDC  and  NWZPDC,  respectively,  are  taking  over \nBPDB\u2019s distribution networks in the western and northwestern parts of the country.  \n \nE. \n \nWhile BPDB in FY2000 produced more than 90% of the total net generation, in FY2005 \n8. \nit  accounted  for  47.8%.  Over  the  same  period,  the  share  of  IPPs  (including  RPC)  in  total  net \ngeneration increased from 8.4% to 38.2%.

While the two key sector entities, \nthe  Power  Grid  Company  of  Bangladesh  Limited  (PGCB)  and  the  Dhaka  Electric  Supply \nCompany  Limited  (DESCO)  outperformed  other  entities,  the  Bangladesh  Power  Development \nBoard (BPDB) and Dhaka Electric Supply Authority (DESA) continue to make financial losses. \nThis  tariff  analysis1 intends  to  (i)  explore  the  reasons  behind  these  financial  and  operational \nperformance  disparities,  (ii)  identify  core  weaknesses  at  the  sector  and  corporate  levels,  (iii) \nassess various scenarios, and (iv) recommend a feasible solution to address the issues.  \n\nAnalysis \n\n1.   Wholesale Tariff \n\nThe current tariff system includes (i) wholesale tariffs, (ii) transmission wheeling charges, \n\nB. \n \n2. \nand (iii) retail distribution tariffs charged to end-use consumers.  \n \n \n \n3. \nIndependent  power  producer  tariffs  are  set  in  long-term  power  purchase  agreements \nspecifying both capacity and energy payments, and these are related to an expected plant load \nfactor for each power station. Plant load factors range from 59% for the Rural Power Company \nLimited  plant  at  Mymensingh  to  81%  at  the  AES  Haripur  power  plant.  In  comparison,  BPDB \ngeneration  units  (hydro,  gas,  diesel,  coal,  and  isolated  diesel)  have  load  factors  ranging  from \n2%  to  49%.  Independent  power  producer  tariffs  charged  to  BPDB  average  Tk2.54  per \nkilowatt-hour  (kWh).  BPDB  units,  including  Ashuganj  Power  Station  Company  Limited,  charge \nan  average  Tk2.10  per  kWh.  BPDB  pooled  generation  (buying)  cost  is  Tk2.26  per  kWh.  The \nweighted  average  cost  at  the  end  of  132  kV  after  technical  losses  is  estimated  at  Tk2.35  per \nkWh, while the average cost at the end of 33 kV is estimated at Tk2.47 per kWh. \n \nBPDB  bulk  power  sales  create  losses  of  Tk0.46  per  kWh  to  Tk0.63  per  kWh, \n4. \naggregating to losses of about Tk9.3 billion per year. BPDB has absorbed the increasing costs \nof bulk power supply and will continue to absorb financial losses unless tariffs are rationalized. \nProvisional  fiscal  year  (FY)  2006  performance  confirms  a  continued  gap  between  BPDB\u2019s \naverage selling price of Tk1.87 per kWh and average supply cost of Tk2.35 per kWh.  \n\n2. \n\nWheeling Charges \n\n \n \nPGCB has a tariff that enables it to earn a profit, with wheeling charges of Tk0.2268 per \n5. \nkWh and Tk0.2291 per kWh, respectively, for bulk delivery to distribution entities at 132 kV and \n33 kV. This type of rate structure has advantages in that it is easily understood by the users of \nthe  grid,  it  is  simple  to  meter,  and  the  billing  is  simple  to  render  and  to  manage.  PGCB\u2019s \nfinancial performance has significantly improved over the years and its current financial position \nis  strong.  Electricity  wheeled  through  the  transmission  network  has  been  increasing  steadily, \nwith growth of 9.2% in FY2004 and 5.9% in FY2005. Transmission system losses declined from \n3.81%  in  FY2002  to  3.42%  in  FY2005.  Gross  revenue  has  also  increased  with  the  present \nwheeling  tariff.  It  is  estimated  that  PGCB\u2019s  ongoing  and  pending  investments  in  transmission \n\n                                                 \n1 This tariff analysis was undertaken in August 2006 based on the information and data available at that time. \n\n \n\n\f42 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n3. \n\nRetail Tariff \n\nand auxiliary equipment will require an increase in wheeling charge to above Tk0.25 per kWh in \norder to maintain profitability in the short run and Tk0.33 per kWh by 2012.  \n \n \n \n6. \nElectricity tariffs have remained unchanged since September 2003. There are separate \ntariffs  for  the  categories  residential,  irrigation,  small  industrial,  nonresidential,  commercial,  low \nvoltage (11 kV), medium voltage (33 kV), high voltage (132 kV), and street lighting. As in many \ncountries,  cross-subsidies  exist  between  customer  categories.  Currently,  BPDB,  DESA,  and \nDESCO charge identical retail tariffs. Nevertheless, the average effective retail income points to \nvarying  performance  levels  among  distribution  entities,  with  DESCO  earning  Tk3.56  per  kWh, \nBPDB earning Tk3.45 per kWh, and DESA earning Tk3.32 per kWh in FY2005. The weighted \naverage retail tariff in taka terms has increased over the past several years, but it is lower today \nin  US  dollar  terms  than  it  was  in  FY2000:  the  average  retail  tariff  is  $0.052  per  kWh  today \ncompared with $0.054 per kWh in FY2000. \n\nRural electric cooperative (PBS) retail tariffs are structured similarly, but the co-ops are \n7. \nallowed to set their own tariffs based on their costs of supply. In general, their tariffs are slightly \nhigher than those of BPDB, DESA, and DESCO and reflect higher distribution costs. Residential \nlifeline  tariffs  (<  100  kWh  per  month  consumption)  range  from  Tk2.53  per  kWh  to  Tk2.90  per \nkWh compared with Tk2.50 per kWh charged by BPDB, DESA, and DESCO. PBS commercial \ntariffs  range  from  Tk5.11  to  Tk5.15  per  kWh  compared  with  the  BPDB  flat  rate  of  Tk5.04  per \nkWh. \n \nThe  combined  market  share  of  BPDB  and  DESA  in  terms  of  bulk  supply,  sales,  and \n8. \nretail  revenue  is  more  than  50%  in  the  retail  distribution  sector,  while  PBSs  serve  about  two \nthirds of the total consumption base. DESCO earns 10% of the total retail revenue from only 3% \nof the customer base, reflecting the best customer mix (the Gulshan area of Dhaka). Under the \ncurrent  retail  tariff  structure,  DESA\u2019s  gross  margin  was  about  Tk0.51  per  kWh  in  FY2005. \nHowever,  DESA\u2019s  collected  revenues  have  been  below  cost  of  service2 since  FY2002,  except \nthat  they  were  marginally  higher  in  FY2005.  After  meeting  bulk  power  purchase  costs,  the \nremaining revenues collected in FY2006 will not be sufficient to cover interest and depreciation. \nDESA\u2019s collection-to-purchase-cost ratio in FY2005 was only 70.0%. DESA fails to collect some \nTk2.3  billion  annually  from  its  customers.  DESA  operated  at  a  negative  gross  margin  until \nDecember  2003,  when  bulk  supply  to  DESCO  and  PBSs  was  discontinued.  DESA  has \naccumulated  significant  liabilities  in  unpaid  bills  to  BPDB  and  PGCB.  DESCO  maintains \nrelatively strong financial performance and has been undertaking various measures to improve \nit,  including  to  outsource  its  network  maintenance,  meter  reading,  and  billing  functions.  As  a \nresult,  its  collection-to-purchase  ratio  improved  to  80.9%  in  FY2005.  At  Tk3.56  per  kWh, \nDESCO\u2019s present weighted average electricity revenue is the highest among all power utilities.   \n\n9. \nSimilarly  to  wholesale  tariffs,  retail  tariffs  are  not  structured  for  cost  recovery  and  are \nessentially inflexible to such external price fluctuations as increases in fuel costs, local currency \ndepreciation,  and  inflation.  Industrial  tariffs  cover  most  of  the  cross-subsidy.  Until  the \nBangladesh  Energy  Regulatory  Commission\u2019s  complete  independence  and  full  authority  is \nestablished, the existing situation will persist and likely deteriorate. In conclusion, it is imperative \nto  rationalize  tariffs  in  order  to  adequately  meet  revenue  requirements,  and  to  undertake \nfinancial and operational restructuring of sector entities to ensure the overall health of the sector.  \n \n\n                                                 \n2  Cost of service includes depreciation based on historical fixed asset values and excludes returns on equity.  \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n43 \n\n4. \n\nFinancial Restructuring and Impacts on Government\u2019s Budget \n\n5. \n\nScenario Analysis \n\n \n10. \nThe financial restructuring entails cleaning up cross-debts and dues among and between \nsector entities, the Government, and quasi-governmental entities that cannot be recovered and \nwill not directly translate into profitability for sector entities. This is highly relevant to DESA, and \nBPDB will also be at the center of financial restructuring since the power sector remains geared \ntowards a single-buyer principle.  \n \n11. \nThe Government\u2019s budget is much affected by this sector\u2019s chronic problems. The weak \nsector entities do not service their debts from foreign and government loans and continue to rely \non government budget transfers for capital investment. It is not realistic to expect from them tax \nand dividend revenues. A majority of any tax revenues will be redirected to subsidizing the ailing \npower  sector.  By  undertaking  tariff  reforms  in  parallel  with  financial  restructuring,  government \nwill be able to lay a stable foundation for sector entities. \n \n \n \n12. \nBPDB\u2019s current high generation cost reflects poor operational efficiency and high cost of \npower  plants  using  diesel  and  furnace  oil.  Operational  efficiency  improvements  that  reduce \noverall system losses and improve collections will, to a degree, also reduce the cost of supply. \nAccording to an assessment by the Government\u2019s Power Cell, when the gas pipeline to Khulna \nis completed in FY2010, BPDB will be able to save Tk5 billion solely through fuel cost savings \nby converting from diesel and oil to gas. Currently, generation cost at BPDB\u2019s Khulna plants is \nabout Tk8.00/kWh, reflecting high oil costs. The Power Cell has calculated that a 10% per year \nrise  in  wholesale  tariff  would  allow  BPDB  to  incur  Tk4,260  million  losses  in  FY2007,  Tk450 \nmillion losses in FY2008 and a Tk5,270 million profit in FY2009.  \n \nThree scenario analyses have been undertaken: (i) business as usual (0% increase for \n13. \nfuture  years),  (ii)  wholesale  cost  recovery  (a  realistic  and  phased  approach  to  increases  in \nwholesale tariffs where the real increase is based on BPDB\u2019s cost of service per kWh sold), and \n(iii) full rationalization (wholesale cost recovery plus increase in retail tariffs).  \n \n \n\nScenario 1: Business as Usual   \n\na. \n\n \n\n14. \nTariffs  are  held  steady  with  projected  net  increase  in  generation.  As  shown  in  Table \nA3.1,  BPDB\u2019s  percentage  of  funding  gap  (the  shortfall  generated  by  deducting  cost  of  service \nfrom  projected  average  electricity  revenue)  will  be  13%  in  FY2006  and  increase  to  42%  in \nFY2011. In this scenario, BPDB will not be financially sustainable unless heavily subsidized by \nthe Government.  \n\nTable A3.1: Projected BPDB Performance \n(Tk per kWh) \n \n\nFiscal Year \nAverage Electricity Revenue \nCost of Service per kWh Sold  \nSurplus/(Shortfall) \n\n% of Funding Gap \n\n2006 \n2.31 \n2.60 \n(0.29) \n-13 \n\n2007 \n2.31 \n2.73 \n(0.42) \n-18 \n\n2008 \n2.31 \n2.83 \n(0.52) \n-23 \n\n2009 \n2.31 \n2.92 \n(0.61) \n-26 \n\n2010 \n2.31 \n3.26 \n(0.95) \n-41 \n\n2011 \n2.32 \n3.30 \n(0.98) \n-42 \n\nkWh = kilowatt-hour. \nSources: Bangladesh Power Development Board and Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n \n\n\f44 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n \n\nb. \n\nScenario 2: Wholesale Cost Recovery \n\n \n \n \n15. \nA  10%  real  increase  is  introduced  in  January  2007,  followed  by  5%  real  raises  in \nFY2009 and FY2010, with implementation of automatic tariff adjustment starting from FY2008. \nIndexation for inflation and exchange rate fluctuations results in rises averaging about 6% per \nannum.

Increases should be spread over a number of years to minimize \nthe  downstream  adverse  impact.  Wholesale  tariffs  need  to  be  raised  by  10%  on  average  with \neffect from January 2007. Further real increases of 5% are assumed in FY2009 and FY2010. By \n2010, tariffs would thereby be brought into line with the underlying cost of service for BPDB. The \ncumulative impact of efficiency improvements and increasing base load generating capacity will \nmake it possible to reduce tariffs in real terms in later years. The analysis also confirms that (i) \nthe  existing  PGCB  tariffs  can  be  retained  until  FY2007,  (ii)  indexation  adjustments  will  be \nneeded from FY2008, and (iii) tariffs can be reduced in real terms in later years. \n \nTo make the sector self-sufficient and reduce pressure on the budget, the issues of high \n18. \nlosses,  poor  collection,  and  low  tariffs  must  be  resolved.  The  Power  Division  of  MPEMR  has \nproposed  to  increase  the  bulk  supply  tariff  by  10%  and  raise  retail  tariffs  by  5%  for  DESA, \nDESCO, BPDB, and REB. In October 2006, a hearing was held on the proposed tariff increase \nby  the  Bangladesh  Energy  Regulatory  Commission.  If  this  proposal  is  accepted  and \nimplemented immediately,3 and if an automatic adjustment mechanism is applied and faithfully \nimplemented  from  FY2008,  the  sector  entities\u2014particularly  BPDB\u2014will  be  in  the  black  from \nFY2009 with minimum real increases needed in later years. It is also necessary to clean up the \nbalance sheets of BPDB and DESA by undertaking financial restructuring that involves write-off \nof unrecoverable cross-debts and customer receivables and conversion into equity of overdue \ndebt service and long-term loans payable to the Government. In order to continue power sector \ncommercialization  and  system  loss  reductions,  the  key  challenge  is  to  restructure  the  power \nsector\u2019s  long-term  debt  to  deliver  tariffs  that  are  affordable  and  also  permit  Government  and \nincoming  private  investors  to  recover  the  costs  of  new  investments.  ADB-assisted  sector \nreforms, together with investment projects are expected to provide a stable fiscal environment \nand an opportunity to achieve long-term sustainability of the power sector. \n\n                                                 \n3 The proposal was accepted and implemented from 1 March 2007. \n\n \n\n\fEXTERNAL ASSISTANCE TO THE POWER SECTOR \n\nTable A4.1: ADB Lending and

Country Poverty Analysis  \n\nA. \n \nIs the sector identified as a national \npriority in country poverty analysis?   \n\n \n\n \n\n  Yes \n\n    No \n\nIs the sector identified as a national priority in \ncountry poverty partnership agreement?   \n\n \n\n \n\n  Yes \n\n    No \n\nContribution of the sector/subsector to reduce poverty in Bangladesh:  \n\nDespite  considerable  progress,  Bangladesh  is  still  one  of  the  world\u2019s  poorest  nations,  with  average  per  capita  gross \ndomestic product only marginally higher than the dollar-a-day international poverty standard. At present, only a third of the \npopulation has access to electricity, considered insufficient even by low-income country standards. In 2000, only 12% of \nthe poorest households had electricity connections (3% in rural and 46% in urban areas). People who do have access to \nelectricity receive poor, unreliable services  with frequent power shortages and  low  voltage. The  Partnership Agreement \non  Poverty  Reduction  between  the  Government  of  Bangladesh  (the  Government)  and  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB) \nemphasizes the need to provide reliable power supply to help reduce poverty.   \n\nProvision of reliable power supplies is essential for sustained economic growth and other social services. The project loan \nis  expected  to  reduce  system  losses,  and  improve  quality  of  supply,  leading  to  more  efficient  energy  use  and  making \nmore  power  available  to  support  sustained  economic  growth.  Expanding  clean  energy  capacity  and  augmenting \ntransmission grid and distribution systems are expected to result in efficient and more reliable service delivery, particularly \nbenefiting  commercial,  residential,  and  agricultural  consumers.  More  reliable  power  supply  will  help  manufacturing  and \nservice  industries,  including  the  garment  sector  that  employs  several  million  poor  people,  particularly  poor  women. \nAgricultural  production  is  also  dependent  on  energy,  especially  electricity.  Poor  and  vulnerable  consumers,  including \nhospitals, schools, and other social facilities, who are often the hardest hit by inadequate power supply, load shedding, \nand  poor  quality  of  power,  are  likely  to  benefit  directly  from  the  project  loan.  A  positive,  direct  impact  on  local  labor  is \nexpected  during  implementation  of  the  project  loan,  and  an  indirect  impact  will  also  occur  due  to  enhanced  income-\ngenerating opportunities resulting from increased access to electricity. The ongoing multi-funding agency support to the \nGovernment\u2019s power sector reform is an indication of the importance the Government places on the sector\u2019s contribution \nto national development. \n \n\nB. \n\nPoverty Analysis \n\n \n\nProposed Classification: General intervention \n\nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed? \n\nThe envisaged program and project loans, which follow the Power Sector Development Program approved in 2003, are \nexpected  to  have  indirect  benefits  on  the  lives  of  poor  people  who  use  small  amounts  of  electricity  and  women  who \nengage in micro-level production activities.  \n\nOn the policy side, improved governance through financial stabilization, corporatization, and commercialization will result \nin better service to the public. The functioning independent regulator will provide transparent consultative procedures for \nissuing tariff rulings that protect consumer interests. Possible reduction in costs of products can be expected from price \nrationalization  and  efficiency  gains.  Employees  will  benefit  from  a  new  management  structure  and  skills  training.  In  the \npast,  energy  enterprises'  losses  have  put  huge  pressures  on  the  national  budget,  with  adverse  implications  for \nmacroeconomic  stability  and  resource  allocation  for  social  spending,  particularly  for  the  poor.  Capital  expenditures,  in \n2002  amounting  to  Tk20  billion  annually,  or  15%  of  the  Annual  Development  Program,  are  equivalent  to  90%  of  total \npublic spending on health and 40% of public education spending.   \n\nContinued  sector  reforms  will  facilitate  power  utilities  to  transition  from  ADB  budget  \u201csinks\u201d  to  public  revenue  sources, \nfreeing up government funds for critical social investments. Increased private sector participation is expected to benefit all \npower consumers. Indeed, the larger power plants operated by independent power producers currently produce the low-\ncost  electricity.  Reducing  current  subsidies  to  the  power  sector  will  increase  Bangladesh\u2019s  social  capital,  which  will,  in \nturn,  stimulate  economic  growth,  creating  a  \u201cvirtuous  circle\u201d  of  economic  growth  that  will  generate  more  Government \nrevenue to fund social and poverty reduction spending.  \n\nUnstable  power  supply  and  peak  period  power  cuts  affect  peoples\u2019  lives  in  various  ways.  The  poor,  and  particularly \nwomen  who  work  as  front-line  workers  on  a  piece  basis,  are  severely  affected  by  power  loss.  Health  clinics  and \ndiagnostic  services  are  also  seriously  disrupted,  as  many  units  become  nonoperational  due  to  low  voltage  or  have  a \nshorter  service  life  because  of  constant  power  outages.  Water  supply  and  streetlights  are  of  poor  quality  due  to  power \ndisruption.  Students  will  benefit  from  longer  study  hours,  information  technology-based  learning,  and  communications \nopportunities. Improved recreational facilities and better municipal services are expected to result from improved power \nsupply. The project loan  will  reduce lost productivity  due to power outages, reduce equipment damage and loss due to \nfrequency fluctuations and low voltage, and reduce potential impairment of emergency services due to load shedding.   \n\n \n\n\f70 \n\nAppendix 11 \n\n  Yes \n\n   No  \n\nParticipation Process \n\n \nC. \n \nIs there a stakeholder analysis?  \nParticipation  during  project  preparation:  The  executing  agencies  undertook  consultations  with  local  officials  and  village \nleaders  that  raised  the  level  of  awareness,  built  local  support,  and  enabled  affected  people  to  voice  opinions  and \nsuggestions for project design and implementation. The poor, women, and other vulnerable groups have been carefully \nconsidered in conducting participatory activities. As a part of social assessment, stakeholders\u2019 consultations in the project \nareas  were  carried  out  with  the  broad  objective  of  ensuring  extensive  participation  of  all  types  of  stakeholders.  The \nparticipatory approach will be continued during implementation.  \n \nIs there a participation strategy?   \nAll  stakeholders  were  actively  involved  in  order  to  reduce  or  avoid  negative  impacts  and  ensure  that  benefits  are  fairly \ndistributed.  Local  officials  and  affected  communities  were  also  involved  in  finalizing  the  design.  In  particular,  ADB\u2019s \nconsultants  hired  under  the  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  and  the  Power  Grid  Company  of  Bangladesh \nLimited\u2019s consultants, respectively, carried out independent surveys with affected communities at different stages during \nthe project preparation and finalization of the design. Local authorities were also consulted to define the alignment along \nwith members of civil society and nongovernment organizations. The survey results are provided in the full resettlement \nplan in Supplementary Appendix I.  \n \nD. \n\nGender and Development \n\n   No  \n\n  Yes \n\nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \n\nThe executing agencies will ensure that women and men are given equal opportunities for employment on the investment \nproject.

Of these, only part B is expected to have resettlement impacts, mainly temporary. \nA  full  resettlement  plan  (RP),  salient  points  of  which  are  identified  in  this  summary,  has  been \nprepared by the Executing Agency (EA) of part B, Power Grid Company of Bangladesh Limited \n(PGCB). Part B consists of five transmission line subprojects:  \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nabout 50 kilometer (km) of 400 kilovolt (kV) line from Meghnaghat to Aminbazar \nand associated line bay extensions;  \nabout 4 km of 230 kV lines from Aminbazar to Kallyanpur, about 6 km of 230 kV \nunderground  cables  from  Kallyanpur  to  Old  Dhaka  Airport,  associated  line  bay \nextensions,  gas  insulated  system  substations  at  Dhaka  Old  Airport,  Dhaka \nUniversity and Cantonment;  \nabout 73 km of 132 kV line from Magura to Chuadanga through Jhenaidah, two \nnew  132/33  kV  system  substations  in  Magura  and  Chuadanga,  and  line  bay \nextensions at existing Jhenaidah system substation;  \nabout  40  km  of  132  kV  line  from  Naogaon  to  Joypurhat,  one  new  132/33  kV \nsystem  substation  in  Joypurhat,  and  line  bay  extensions  at  existing  Naogaon \nsystem substations; and  \nabout  45  km  of  132  kV  line  from  Thakurgaon  to  Panchagar,  one  132/33  kV \nsystem substation in Panchagar.  \n\n \n\n2. \nThe  updated  RP  will  be  submitted  for  approval  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB) \nprior  to  awarding  civil  contracts.  Land  acquisition  and  resettlement  impacts  of  the  subprojects \nhave been assessed and are documented in the RP.  \n \n3. \nAs shown in Table A12.1, field studies indicate that some 60 households owning some \n26 acres along all the five transmission line routes will be affected by loss of agricultural land. \nPrimarily,  this  will  be  due  to  the  land  being  used  for  transmission  tower  footings.  Of  the  60 \nhouseholds, 35 are expected to permanently lose land to construction of system substations in \nthe 132-kV lines subprojects. The total amount of land lost will be 26 acres. \n \n\nTable A12.1: Estimated Land Acquisition and Resettlement Impacts \n \n\nAffected Households \n60  \n\nAcres (% of total) \n\nType of Resettlement Effect \nA.

Consultation  showed  that  affected  persons  had  positive  views  toward  power  sector \ndevelopment  in  Bangladesh  and  the  implementation  of  the  Project  in  their  area.  Their \nwillingness  to  participate  in  project  activities  was  confirmed  during  the  consultation.  A \nsocioeconomic  survey  of  affected  persons  has  been  undertaken.  Information  campaigns  were \nheld  for  affected  persons  to  provide  inputs  to  the  RP.  A  resettlement  information  leaflet \ncontaining  information  on  compensation  and  resettlement  options  has  been  made  available  in \nlocal language for distribution to affected persons. The EA conducted consultations with village \nand  religious  leaders.  Each  affected  person  has  been  provided  information  regarding  specific \nentitlements. Disputes on entitlements can be forwarded to the resettlement unit for appropriate \naction.  The  RP  has  been  disclosed  on  the  ADB  website,  and  information  dissemination  and \nconsultation will continue throughout the project implementation period.  \n \nGrievance  redress  committees  (GRCs)  will  be  established  for  the  subproject  with \n7. \nrepresentation  from  the  EA,  affected  persons  (including  vulnerable  groups),  local  government, \nand  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs).  Other  than  disputes  relating  to  ownership  rights \nunder  a  court  of  law,  the  GRC  will  review  grievances  involving  all  resettlement  benefits, \nrelocations, and other assistance forwarded by the EA\u2019s resettlement unit or affected persons. \nGrievances will be redressed within 2\u20134 weeks from the dates of lodging complaints. Appeals \nagainst GRC decisions can be addressed by affected persons to appropriate courts of law. \n \nD. \n \n8. \nThe  project  activities  will  not  involve  displacement  of  people  from  their  present \nhomesteads  and  have  only  limited  impact  on  the  incomes  and  livelihoods  of  the  affected \npersons.  This  RP  was  prepared  to  provide  appropriate  mitigation  measures  to  look  after  the \naffected populations and all losses that might be incurred.  \n \n9. \nThe socioeconomic survey data show that none of the acquired land will affect housing \nstructures.  A  separate  settlement  area  for  relocating  households  will  not  be  necessary.  The \nsocioeconomic survey indicated no plots of agricultural land to be converted for housing in the \nfuture. Houses on the transmission line rights-of-way will be discouraged, and an option for such \nhouseholds has been kept open if these affected persons would like to relocate and convert the \nhouse plot for another purpose, such as a garden or agriculture. The necessary compensation \npackages  and  budget  (detailed  in  Table  A12.4)  will  be  available.  Considering  their  potential \nvulnerability,  particular  attention  will  be  given  to  female-headed  households  and  renters.  An \naffected  person  may  choose  a  human  resources  development  or  occupational  skills \ndevelopment option, and necessary training will be provided by selected training organizations \nor NGOs. Upon completion of such training, bank loan facilities will be extended in easy terms \nso  that  the  affected  persons  can  begin  income  generation  programs.  The  program  will  be \ndesigned for sustainability and systematically monitored and evaluated.  \n \n10. \nThe  subprojects  will  affect  a  number  of  people  from  agricultural  activities.  Many  of  the \naffected persons may have to switch from agriculture activities to small-scale trading or become \n\nCompensation and Income Restoration \n\n \n\n\f76 \n\nAppendix  12 \n\nInstitutional Framework and Resettlement Costs \n\nday laborers. Compensation packages will be sufficient so that marginal farmers may make the \nswitch, provided they have training or guidance from NGOs appointed for implementing the RP.1 \n \nE. \n \n11. \nThe  EA  will  engage  a  resettlement  specialist  and  NGO,  which  will  constitute  a \nresettlement unit, and through which it will have overall coordination, planning, implementation, \nmanagement and monitoring, and financing responsibilities for the RP. The EA will ensure that \nkey  institutions,  including  the  local  government,  are  involved  in  RP  implementation.  Further, \nexperienced  NGOs  will  be  hired  for  RP  implementation  with  clearly  defined  tasks,  including \ntraining and community-based social development programs, as appropriate.  \n \n\nTable A12.4: Total Resettlement Budget for Subprojects \n(Tk million) \n \n\n132 kV Magura\u2013\nJhenaidah\u2014\nChuadanga \n\n132 kV \nNaogaon\u2014\nJoypurhat \n\n132 kV \nThakurgaon\u2014\nPanchaghar  \n\n400 kV \nMeghnaghat\u2014\nAminbazar  \n\n230 kV \nAminbazar\u2014Old \nDhaka Airport \n\nBudget \n\nBudget \n\nBudget \n\nBudget \n\nBudget \n\nLand \n(acres) \n0.6 \n\nLand \n(acres) \n5.1 \n\nLand \n(acres) \n10.0 \n\n45.00 \n\n2.89 \n\n22.50 \n\n0.69 \n\nLand \n(acres) \n0.0 \n\nLand  \n(acres) \n10.0 \n\n392.0 \n\n4.38 \n\n248.0 \n\n2.40 \n\n256.0 \n\n2.70 \n\n672.0 \n\n3.50 \n\n32.0 \n\n \n \n \nItem \n\nLand for \nSubstations:  \nRights-of-Way \nfor \nTransmission \nLines \n\n0.00 \n\n0.80 \n\n0.80 \n\n5.29 \n\n4.19 \n\n32.0 \n\n25.20 \n\n49.38 \n\n402.0 \n\n261.1 \n\n682.0 \n\n248.6 \n\nMonitoring \n\nTotal \nkV = kilovolt. \nSources: Power Grid Company of Bangladesh Limited. \n \nF. \n \n12. \nInternal  monitoring  by  PGCB  will  deal  with  all  aspects  of  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement  at  the  subproject  level.  The  project  director  or  EA\u2019s  resettlement  unit  will  be \nresponsible for monitoring the progress of resettlement activities at the subproject level. This will \ninclude (i) an information campaign and consultation with the affected persons, (ii) status of land \nacquisition  and  compensation  payments,  (iii)  compensation  for  lost  structures  and  assets,  (iv) \nrelocation of affected persons, and (v) payment of income-restoration assistance. Benchmarks \nfor subproject level monitoring will come from land acquisition and the census. \n \n13. \nThe implementing NGO will conduct field-level monitoring and assess the daily operation \nof  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  activities.  The  mechanisms  to  be  used  in  field-level \nmonitoring  include  (i)  review  of  affected  person  files,  (ii)  informal  sample  survey  of  affected \npersons, (iii) key informant interviews, (iv) in-depth case studies, and (v) community and public \nmeetings. \n \nExternal  monitoring  involves  review  of  resettlement  implementation,  in  particular \n14. \nverification  of  the  compensation,  resettlement,  and  rehabilitation  activities;  verification  of  the \ngrievance  redress  mechanisms  utilization;  and  provision  of  feedback.

The EA will \nmake  provision  in  the  contractor  contracts  for  preferential  employment  of  qualified  affected  persons,  including \naffected women, in subproject works. \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 12 \n\n77\n\n \n\nshall  also  verify  the  results  of  internal  monitoring  in  the  field  as  well  as  consult  with  affected \npersons, officials, and community leaders for preparing review reports. The external monitoring \nwill  commence  in  the  first  quarter  of  project  implementation  and  shall  continue  through  the \noverall project implementation period. \n \n15. \nThe  specific  tasks  and  methodology  for  external  monitoring  shall  include  (i)  review  of \npre-project baseline data on affected persons; (ii) identification and selection of an appropriate \nset  of  indicators  for  gathering  and  analyzing  information  on  resettlement  impacts;  (iii)  use  of \nvarious formal and informal surveys for impact analysis; and (iv) assessment of the resettlement \nefficiency,  effectiveness,  impact,  and  sustainability  while  drawing  lessons  as  a  guide  to  future \nresettlement policy making and planning. \n\n \n\n\f78 \n\nAppendix  13 \n\nA. \n\nIntroduction \n\nSUMMARY INITIAL ENVIRONMENTAL EXAMINATION \n\nEnvironmental  assessment  of  the  proposed  policy  reforms  and  investments  under  the \n1. \nSustainable  Power  Sector  Development  Program  (the  Program)  has \nfollowed  ADB\u2019s \nenvironmental  policy  and  assessment  guidelines,1 as  well  as  the  Government\u2019s  environmental \nassessment  regulations  and  guidelines.  The  executing  agencies  (EAs)  of  the  Program  have \nprepared  an  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE)  for  each  investment  component.  This \nsummary  IEE  outlines  key  aspects  of  the  proposed  program,  environmental  benefits  and \nnegative impacts, proposed mitigation measures, and a preliminary environmental management \nplan (EMP).  \n \n2. \nThe  Program  supports  the  Government\u2019s  goal  to  provide  electricity  service  to  all  the \npopulation by 2020, and it comprises policy and investment components. The program loan is to \nprovide  support  and  incentives  to  the  Government  for  power  sector  reforms  through  financial \nstabilization and improved governance of sector entities. The investment components are linked \nto ongoing power sector reforms and will expand clean-fuel power generation capacity, enhance \ntransmission  network  reliability,  and  improve  quality  of  supply  in  Dhaka  city  and  surrounding \nareas. Overall system efficiency will be improved. The investment components are presented in \nTable A13.1. \n \n\nTable A13.1:  Investment Components \n \n\nComponent / Executing Agency \nPart A: Clean Energy Capacity Expansion / BPDB \n150 MW peaking power plants at Khulna and Sirajganj, plus associated switchgear and transmission facilities \nPart B: Transmission System Efficiency Improvements / PGCB \n400 kV transmission system,  50 kilometer (km) line from Meghnaghat to Aminbazar \n230 kV transmission system improvements from Aminbazar to Dhaka Old Airport and Dhaka University \n132  kV  transmission  system  in  western  Bangladesh:    73-km  line  from  Chuadanga  to  Jhenaida  to  Magura;  40-km \nline from Naogaon to Jaipurhat; 45-km line from Thakurgaon to Panchagar \nPart C: Distribution System Efficiency Improvements in DESA Area/DPDC \nUpgrade of 10 substations; 5 new 33/11 kV substations. \n2 new 132/33 kV substations to meet existing and new demand; 132- and 33-kV overhead lines and underground \ncables \nInstallation  of  transformers  and  associated  equipment  in  3  existing  132/33  kV  substations  and  33kV  underground \ncables \nUpgrading of a 11 kV switching station to a regular 33/11 kV substation \nPart D: Distribution System Efficiency Improvements in DESCO Area/DESCO \nGulshan distribution system upgrade: 4 new 33/11 kV substations  \nMirpur distribution system upgrade: 2 new 33/11 kV substations \n\nBPDB = Bangladesh Power Development Board, DESA = Dhaka Electric Supply Authority, DESCO = Dhaka Electric \nSupply  Company  Ltd.,  DPDC  =  Dhaka  Power  Distribution  Company  Ltd.,  km  =  kilometer,  kV  =  kilovolt,  MW  = \nmegawatt, PGCB = Power Grid Company of Bangladesh Ltd. \nSources: Government of Bangladesh and Asian Development Bank. \n \nB. \n\nDescription of the Environment \n\n3. \nThe  project  components  are  located  in  four  general  areas:  (i)  the  existing  Goalpara \npower complex in Khulna (part A), (ii) west bank of the Jamuna River just south of the Jamuna \nRiver Bridge (part A), (iii) the Teesta and High Ganges basins and Himalayan piedmont areas of \n                                                 \n\n1    ADB.  2002  Environment  Policy  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank.  Manila;  and  ADB.  2003.  Environmental \n\nAssessment Guidelines. Manila. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 13 \n\n79\n\n \n\nwestern Bangladesh (part B3), and (iv) the Dhaka metropolitan area (parts B1, B2, C, and D). \nThe project areas can be broadly classified as the greater lower basin of the Bairab, Jamuna, \nMeghna, and Padma river systems, typified by low-relief plains with large braided river channels. \nIn  low  lying  areas,  housing  and  other  structures  are  commonly  built  on  2\u20133  meter  thick  sand \nfoundations to prevent flood damage.   \n \n4. \nSoils are typical of river floodplains, ranging from sands to clays derived from the greater \nHimalayan  mountain  range.  Land  use  outside  of  Dhaka  is  dominated  by  agriculture,  with \naverage  forest  cover  of  about  10%.  Surface  water  is  commonly  used  for  all  purposes.  \nGroundwater  use  is  also  common,  but  many  areas  of  the  country  suffer  from  high \nconcentrations  of  arsenic  in  groundwater.  There  are  no  sensitive,  threatened,  or  endangered \nspecies  in  the  areas  directly  impacted  by  the  investment  components,  with  the  exception  of \nGangetic dolphins in the river systems.  \n \n5. \nClimate is subtropical monsoon with three seasons: (i) summer and pre-monsoon from \nMarch to May, (ii) monsoon from June to October, and (iii) winter from November to February. \nTemperatures  are  in  the  range  9\u201325\u00b0  C  in  winter  and  24\u201334\u00b0 C  in  monsoon  season.  Annual \naverage  rainfall  ranges  from  around  1,850  to  2,500  millimeters  per  year,  concentrated  during \nMay-July,  with  higher  average  rainfall  around  Dhaka.  Air  quality  is  poor  in  the  Dhaka  area, \nmainly  due  to  industrial  and  transport  sources,  but  it  has  improved  with  the  introduction  of \ncompressed natural gas for transport. Air quality outside the cities is much better, given the lack \nof  industrial  air  pollution  sources.  Areas  north  and  east  of  these  rivers  are  in  seismic  zone  II, \nwhich requires that man-made structures be built to withstand 0.05 g ground acceleration. Areas \nsouth and west of these rivers are in seismic zone I, with lower earthquake risk. \n \n6. \nSocioeconomic conditions vary between urbanized areas of Dhaka and secondary cities \nin  the  western  zone  and  the  smaller  towns  and  villages  in  the  rural  areas.  Outside  the  Dhaka \nurban  core  is  becoming  heavily  industrialized,  with  ex-urban  growth  steadily  encroaching  on \nagricultural land. Schools and public health services are readily accessible. About a third of the \npopulation  currently  has  some  electric  power  service,  although  quality  and  reliability  are  not \nuniform.  More  than  90%  of  the  population  has  access  to  improved  water  supply,  with  piped \nwater common in urban areas and wells common in rural areas. About half of the population has \naccess to improved sanitation.     \n \nC. \n\nAnticipated Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n\nEnvironmental  and  social  benefits  will  occur  due  to  expanding  the  electric  power \n7. \nnetwork,  which  uses  clean  natural  gas  for  power  generation  (replacing diesel  generating  sets, \ntraditional  wood  fuel,  and  agricultural  biomass  energy),  improving  power  system  efficiency  via \nnew  transmission  and  distribution  capacity,  and  reducing  aggregate  technical  and  commercial \nlosses  via  system  upgrades.  Environmental  benefits  include  improved  indoor  air  quality, \nreduced  regional  air  pollutant  loads,  and  offsetting  growth  in  greenhouse  gas  emissions.  The \nincremental  power  supplies  from  the  Project  will  be  sufficient  to  serve  at  least  6  million \nconsumers at current per capita generation rates.  \n \n8. \nPotential  adverse  environmental  impacts  will  be restricted  to  the  areas associated with \ninvestment  components,  and  can  be  avoided  and  minimized  through  careful  site  and  route \nselection. Sites of the proposed subprojects have been selected to avoid acquisition of private \nland,  minimize  resettlement,  and  minimize  negative  environmental  impacts.  Table  A13.2 \nsummarizes the anticipated impacts during construction and operations. Overall, the Project will \nhave minimal negative impacts and these can be cost-effectively mitigated.   \n \n\n \n\n\fDomestic wastewater \n\nPower plant and  \nsubstations  \n\nBOD, COD, fecal \ncoliform  \n\nPrimary treatment, if \nneeded. \n\n80 \n\nAppendix  13 \n\nTypes of \nImpacts  \nNoise: \nConstruction \nPeriod \n\nNoise: \nOperational \nPeriod \n\nWastewater: \nConstruction \nPeriod \n\nWastewater: \nOperational \nPeriod \n\nImpact Sources \n\nTable A13.2: Project Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n \nLocation of \nSources \nConstruction sites \nand access roads \n\n70 dBA at site \nboundary \n\nPollutant or \nParameter \n\nConstruction equipment \nand equipment repair \nyards \n\nPower plant \n \n400-kV transmission line \nand associated \nsubstations \n\nTurbine-generator \nsets \n \nOutdoor \nSwitchyards \n\n70 dBA at site \nboundary  \n\nDomestic wastewater \n\nWork site and \nconstruction \ncamps \n\nIndustrial wastewater \nfrom construction \nequipment maintenance \n\nEquipment \nmaintenance \nyards \n\nBOD, COD, fecal \ncoliform \n\nPetroleum and \ndetergent \n\nCooling water from \nKhulna and  Sirajganj \npower plants \n \n \n \nIndustrial wastewater \nand oils from \ntransformer replacement \n\nOutlet to Bhaidab \nand Jamuna \nRivers  \n \n \n \nTransformers \nbeing taken out of \nservice \n\nTemperature, pH, \nBOD, etc. to meet \nGovernment\u2019s \nindustrial wastewater \nstandards \n \nMineral oil; possible \noil with PCBs \n\nAir Quality: \nConstruction \nPeriod \n\nDust during construction \nand exhaust gases from \nconstruction machinery \nand vehicles \n\nConstruction \nsites, access \nroads, and \nsurrounding areas \n\nIncreased TSP, NO2, \nSO2 levels at \nconstruction sites and \nsurrounding areas \n\nAir Quality: \nOperational \nPeriod \n\nNitrogen oxide (NOX) \nemissions from power \nplant \n \n\nKhulna and \nSirajganj power \nplants \n\nSolid Wastes: \nConstruction \nPeriod \n\nSpoils from earth \nmoving, construction \ndebris \n\nConstruction sites \nand workers' \ncamps \n\nSolid Wastes: \nOperational \nPeriod \n\nGarbage from power \nplant and substations \n\nPower plant and \nSubstations \n\nNOX stack emissions \nstandard: 30 ppm  \n \nAmbient air quality \nstandard:  100 \u00b5g /m3 \n(annual average) \nEarth and domestic \nsolid waste \n\nTreatment Measures \n\nEquipment to meet local \nnoise standards. \nConstruction scheduling to \navoid evening and \nnighttime disruption. \n\nLocate facility 70\u2013100 m \nfrom nearest receptor. \nUse of walls, fencing, \nand/or greenbelt to \nprovide partial sound \nbarrier. \nPrimary treatment if \nneeded by larger camps \n\nSedimentation and \nbiological treatment, if \nnecessary. \n\nPassive cooling; primary \nand secondary treatment, \nas necessary. \n \n \n \nOff-site disposal at \nlicensed treatment facility, \nor alternate on-site \ntreatment as approved by \npollution control board \nContinuous management \nmeasures to be imposed \nat the construction sites. \n\nBest available technology \ndesign; control through \nwater injection, if \nnecessary. \n\nSpoils to be used as base \nmaterial for substations \nand greenbelts. \n\napproved by local \ngovernment pollution \ncontrol agencies. \n\nDomestic solid waste  Disposed at facilities \n\nBOD  =  biochemical  oxygen  demand,  COD  =  chemical  oxygen  demand,  dBA  =  decibels  (measured  in  the  audible \nrange), kV = kilovolt, NO2 = nitrogen dioxide, NOx = nitrogen oxides, PCB = polychlorinated biphenyl, ppm = parts per \nmillion, SO2 = sulfur dioxide, TSP = total suspended particles, \u00b5g = microgram. \nSources: Initial environment examination reports of the executing agencies. \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 13 \n\n81\n\n \n\nD. \n\nInstitutional Requirements and Environmental Management Plan \n\n9. \nA  safeguards  implementation  unit  (responsible  for  environment,  resettlement,  and  any \nother  social  development  obligations)  will  be  established  at  each  of  the  EAs.  All  the  EAs  will \nassume  primary  responsibility  for  the  environmental  assessment  and  implementation  of  EMPs \nfor their respective component. ADB will review and approve IEEs and EMPs prior to finalizing \ncontracts  and  commencingt  of  work.  ADB  will  review  monitoring  reports  and  officially  disclose \nthe IEEs on its website.   \n \n10. \nThe  IEEs  include  EMP  covering  (i)  summary  of  potential  impacts,  (ii)  mitigation \nmeasures,  (iii)  environmental  monitoring,  (iv)  public  consultation  processes,  (v)  outline  of \nresponsibilities  and  authorities  for  implementing  the  proposed  monitoring  and  mitigation \nactivities, (vi) reporting and review procedures, (vii) work plan (including staffing and schedules \nof  assigned  personnel,  as  well  as  activities  and  inputs  of  other  government  agencies  and \nstakeholders),  (viii)  environmentally  responsible  procurement  plan,  (ix) cost  estimates,  and  (x) \nmechanisms  for  feedback  and  adjustment.  Table  A13.3  presents  minimum  provisions  for \nthe  respective \nenvironmental  monitoring  related \ncomponents. Estimated costs for mitigation and monitoring measures are in Table A13.4. \n \n11. \nDetailed design work for each investment component will follow the recommendations of \nthe IEE and EMP.

There  is  general  support  for  the  proposed  investment \ncomponents, as electricity service is expected to improve and some employment opportunities \nwill be created.   \n \nEach IEE and EMP, and the summary IEE for the investment project, will be translated \n13. \ninto local language and made available to the public. A grievance redress committee (GRC) will \nbe  established  to  address  all  concerns  and  grievances  of  the  local  communities  and  affected \nparties. The GRC will comprise representatives from local authorities and affected parties, along \nwith other stakeholders as mutually agreed with the local authorities and affected persons. This \ncommittee  will  address  the  Project-related  grievances  of  the  affected  parties  and  will  provide \nthem a public forum to raise their concerns or objections. A senior official from each EA will be \nassigned  to  the  GRC.  The  GRC  will  be  established  in  a  manner  that  ensures  easy  access  to \ncommunities and affected parties. The EAs will be responsible to disseminate information about \nthe  functional  norms  of  the  GRC.  The  committee  will  meet  at  least  twice  per  year,  and  more \nfrequently if required. \n \nThe EMPs will include provisions for both internal and external monitoring. The EAs will \n14. \nbe responsible for internal monitoring of the EMP implementation and will forward twice-yearly \nprogress reports to the Government and ADB. The reports will cover EMP implementation with \nattention  to  compliance  and  corrective  action  for  noncompliant  activities.  An  independent \nmonitoring  agency  will  be  hired  by  the  EAs  with  ADB  concurrence  for  undertaking  external \nmonitoring of the entire project. The external monitoring agency will be selected within 3 months \nof loan approval. The monitoring agency shall report on a twice-yearly basis directly to ADB and \ndetermine  whether  sound  environmental  management  practices  have  been  achieved,  and \nsuggest  suitable  recommendations  and  remedial  measures  for  midterm  correction  and \nimprovement.   \n \nF. \n\nConclusion \n\n15. \nThe proposed investments will have minimal negative environmental impacts, and these \ncan  be  successfully  mitigated  by  implementing  component-specific  EMPs.  Environmental  and \nsocial  benefits  of  the  investment  components  and  long-term  program  objectives  outweigh  the \nnegative impacts. Based on environmental assessment activity conducted to date, and subject \nto  ADB  confirmation  of  environment  categorization,  there  is  no  need  for  a  full  environmental \nimpact assessment. \n\n \n\n\f", "author_pages": [" \n", " \n", " \n", " \n \n \n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n", "CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 21 August 2006) \n", "Currency Unit \n", "taka (Tk) \n", "\u2013 \n", "= \n= \n \n", "Tk1.00 \n$1.00 \n \n", "$0.0144 \nTk69.4750 \n \n", " \n \n \n", " \n \n \n", "ADB \nAPSC \nBERC \nBPDB \nCCL \nDESA \nDESCO \nDPDC \nEA \nEGCB \nEIRR \nEMP \nFIRR \nFY \nGRC \nIEE \nIPP \nLIBOR \nKfW \nMPEMR \nMOF \nNGO \nNWPGC \nNWZPDC \nPBS \nPCB \nPGCB \nPSDP \nPSMPU \nPSRB \nPVAT \nREB \nRP \nRPC \nTA \nUSAID \nWZPDC \n", "ABBREVIATIONS \n", "Asian Development Bank \nAshuganj Power Station Company Limited \nBangladesh Energy Regulatory Commission \nBangladesh Power Development Board \ncash compensation under the law \nDhaka Electric Supply Authority \nDhaka Electric Supply Company Limited \nDhaka Power Distribution Company Limited \nexecuting agency \nElectricity Generation Company of Bangladesh Limited \neconomic internal rate of return \nenvironmental management plan \nfinancial internal rate of return  \nfiscal year \ngrievance redress committee \ninitial environmental examination \nindependent power producer \nLondon interbank offered rate \nKreditanstalt f\u00fcr Wiederaufbau \nMinistry of Power, Energy and Mineral Resources \nMinistry of Finance \nnongovernment organization \nNorthwest Power Generation Company Limited \nNorth West Zone Power Distribution Company Limited \npalli bidyut samity (rural electric cooperative)  \npolychlorinated biphenyl \nPower Grid Company of Bangladesh Limited \npower sector development program \npower system master plan update \nPower Sector Reforms in Bangladesh \nProperty Value Advisory Team \nRural Electrification Board \nresettlement plan \nRural Power Company Limited \ntechnical assistance \nUnited States Agency for International Development \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013  West Zone Power Distribution Company Limited \n", " \n", " \n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n", " \n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n", " \n \n \n", " \n", "WEIGHTS AND MEASURES \n", "GWh \nkV \nkWh \nMW \nMWh \nMVA \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "gigawatt-hour \nkilovolt \nkilowatt-hour \nmegawatt \nmegawatt-hour \nmegavolt-ampere \n", "1,000,000,000 watt-hours \n1,000 volts \n1,000 watt-hours \n1,000,000 watts \n1,000,000 watt-hours \n1,000,000 volt-ampere \n", " \nNOTES \n", "(i) \n", "The fiscal year (FY) of the Government ends on 30 June.
