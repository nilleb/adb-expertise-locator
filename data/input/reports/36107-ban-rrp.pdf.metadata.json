An initial environment examination for the Program \nAssessment  was undertaken and its summary is a core appendix.  \n   \nProgram Description and  Over the past decade, Bangladesh has taken great strides in its \nImpact  economic and social development. Yet, nearly half the population \nremains poor, and per capita gross domestic product was just \n$445 in fiscal year 2005. Only one third of the households have \naccess to electricity and those with access to electricity receive \npoor, unreliable service characterized by frequent power outages \nand low voltage. This results from insufficient power generation \ncapacity as well as poor transmission and distribution systems. \nInadequate  electricity  supply  has  been  a  major  constraint  on \neconomic growth and poverty reduction in Bangladesh. Promoting \nsustainable economic growth by providing reliable power supply is \nthe main strategic pillar for reducing poverty in ADB\u2019s country \nstrategy and program for 2006\u20132010.  \n \nThe Government has issued a 3-year road map in 2006 for power \nsector  reforms  through  intensive  consultations  with  various \nstakeholders,  including  key  development  partners,  setting  out \ndetailed  time-bound  action  plans  for  the  reform  process  and \ninvestment  program  for  2006\u20132008.  The  3-year  road  map \nunderpins  the  principal  reform  components  presented  in  the \nGovernment\u2019s  Vision  and  Policy  Statement  on  Power  Sector \nReforms issued in February 2000 to provide reliable electricity \nsupply to the entire population by 2020 at an affordable price. \nThese principal reform components include (i) segregating power \ngeneration, transmission, and distribution functions into separate \nservices; (ii) commercializing emerging power sector entities; (iii) \neffective  regulation  under  the  Bangladesh  Energy  Regulatory \nCommission (BERC); (iv) promoting private sector participation ", "ii   \nand  public-private  partnership  by  establishing  an  enabling \nenvironment;  (v)  implementing  a  financial  restructuring  and \nrecovery plan for the sector entities; (vi) introducing cost-reflective \ntariff principles to achieve financial viability of the sector entities; \n(vii) developing the capacity of sector entities; and (viii) boosting \noperational performance  by  reducing  system  losses, improving \ncollections to energy import, and reducing arrears.  \n \nApproved in 2003, ADB\u2019s first power sector development program \n(PSDP)  for  Bangladesh  has  yielded  numerous  positive \ndevelopments. A major breakthrough was the emergence of a \nnew  culture  of  accountability  for  electricity  used  by  public \nconsumers. This helped substantially to reduce the outstanding \ndues  of  the  Government  and  its  agencies.  The  two  major \ncompanies  in  the  power  sector,  Power  Grid  Company  of \nBangladesh Limited (PGCB) and Dhaka Electric Supply Company \nLimited (DESCO) have become profitable since 2004. The PSDP \nalso supported the launch of BERC and laid the foundation for \nrestructuring the remaining key power sector entities, Bangladesh \nPower Development Board (BPDB) and Dhaka Electric Supply \nAuthority (DESA). \n \nBuilding on the success of the PSDP and consistent with ADB\u2019s \ncountry and strategy program for Bangladesh, the Program aims \nto  promote  sustained  economic  growth  by  providing  further \nsupport and incentives to the Government for continued power \nsector  reform  activities  through  financial  and  organizational \nrestructuring, improved sector governance, promotion of private \nsector participation, and capacity development, while assisting in \nexpanding clean fuel generation capacity, enhancing transmission \nnetwork  reliability  and  efficiency,  and  improving  the  quality  of \nsupply in Dhaka city and the surrounding areas, the major power \nmarket. The Program is linked to the Government\u2019s sector reform \nroad map, is a part of the least-cost development plan for the \npower sector, and is accorded high priority by the Government.  \n \nThe investment components are also expected to accelerate the \nreform program by (i) transferring the remaining DESA area to a \nnewly  corporatized  entity,  Dhaka  Power  Distribution  Company \nLimited (DPDC), and (ii) creating a new generation company in \nthe northwestern region of the country. They will also enhance the \noperational performance of the sector entities by reducing system \nlosses and generating additional revenues.  \n   \nThe Program Loan   \n   \nOutcome  The  policy  actions  supported  by  the  program  loan  will  help \nimprove sustainability of the power sector through financial and \norganizational restructuring and will focus on five key outputs that \nwill (i) develop and implement a national action plan for continuing \npower sector reforms, (ii) establish a fully functional legal and ", "  iii\nregulatory framework, (iii) enhance the financial health of power \nsector entities, (iv) further restructure the sector entities, and (v) \npromote private sector participation and public-private partnership. \n   \nLoan Amount and Terms  A  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to  $60  million  will  be \nprovided  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Fund  resources  for  the  program \nloan. The loan will have a term of 24 years, including a grace \nperiod of 8 years. The interest charge will be at a rate of 1% per \nannum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter.  \n   \nEstimated Program  30 June 2008 \nCompletion Date \n   \nTranching  The  loan  will  be  released  in  two  equal  tranches,  each  of \nSDR20,225,000 ($30 million equivalent) upon the Government\u2019s \nand power sector entities\u2019 complying with the conditions specified \nfor their release.  \n   \nExecuting Agency  The executing agencies (EAs) will be the Finance Division of the \nMinistry of Finance (MOF) and the Power Division of the Ministry \nof Power, Energy and Mineral Resources (MPEMR). \n   \nProcurement  The proceeds of the program loan will finance the costs (excluding \nlocal taxes and duties) of eligible items, produced in and procured \nfrom ADB\u2019s member countries. \n   \nCounterpart Funds  Counterpart funds generated from the proceeds of the program \nloan will be used to finance the adjustment costs associated with \nthe  program  loan,  including  funding  of  unfunded  pension \nobligations  and  gratuities  and  settlement  of  the  Government\u2019s \noutstanding  debts  as  well  as  those  of  its  autonomous  and \nsemi-autonomous bodies to the power sector entities.  \n   \nThe Project Loan   \n   \nOutcome  The outcome of the project loan is expanded clean-fuel power \ngeneration capacity and improved efficiency in transmission and \ndistribution systems. This is to be achieved by (i) increased peak \nload  generation  capacity  based  on  clean  natural  gas,  and  (ii) \naugmentation  and  expansion  of  power  transmission  and \ndistribution systems. \n   \nRationale  Generation \n   \n  The ADB-financed power system master plan update (PSMPU) \nestimates that demand for electricity will grow at an annual rate of \nabout 8.0% for the next 10 years and that about 20% of the \nadditional generation capacity will be required to serve peak load. \nEven if all presently planned power plants are constructed as \nscheduled, a shortfall in generating capacity of more than 2,000 \nmegawatt (MW) is expected by 2010 and over 5,500 MW by 2015. \n ", "iv   \nThe PSMPU also estimates that $5.4 billion of new investment \nwould be required by 2015 for new generation capacity, of which \nabout half would be covered by the private sector, and the rest by \nthe  Government  and  development  partners.  New  peak  power \ngeneration  capacity  is  urgently  needed  in  the  northern  and \nwestern  regions  of  Bangladesh  to  help  balance  loads,  while \nimproving voltages, stability, and system efficiency. \n   \n  Transmission \n   \n  The  rapidly  growing  demand  for  electricity  requires  a \ncorresponding  increase  in  the  capability  and  efficiency  of  the \ntransmission  system  to  evacuate  the  power  from  new  power \nplants and make it available to existing and new substations. The \nPSMPU\u2019s  least-cost  expansion  plan  concludes  that  additional \ntransmission  capacity  of  4,875  megavolt-ampere  (MVA)  of \n230/132 kilovolt (kV) transformers will be required by 2010 and \nanother 4,650 MVA by 2015. This compares with existing capacity \nof 3,925 MVA. More than three times the current large transformer \ncapacity will be necessary to meet demand in a reliable manner \nby 2015. Approximately $1.0 billion of additional investment would \nbe needed to meet the demand by 2015. Most of that will be \nfunded by the Government and development partners, and partly \nthrough local capital mobilized through issuing bonds and equity \nsecurities in the local market.  \n   \n  Distribution  \n   \n  Expansion of the distribution systems in Dhaka has struggled to \nkeep  up  with  rapid  growth  in  demand.  Several  distribution \nsubstations are very old, while main equipment and protection \nsystems  have  deteriorated.  The  transformers  are  overloaded, \nwhich contributes to faster deterioration. Low voltage is a problem \nboth at the supply side of the substations and at the demand side \ndue to long runs of overloaded distribution lines. Operating under \nsuch conditions contributes to high distribution losses as well as \nfaster  deterioration  of  equipment  condition  and  performance. \nGreater Dhaka Area\u2019s distribution systems need urgently to be \nupgraded to meet the ever-growing demand, which is expected to \ndouble  by  2015.  This  will  require  around  $1.5  billion  of  new \ninvestment to be met by the Government, development partners, \nand local capital. \n   \n  Capacity Development \n   \n  As  a  result  of  implementing  the  reform  policy  since  1994,  a \nnumber of new public sector entities have been established and \nmade operational, and more entities are emerging in the sector. \nThe capacity development effort in the Bangladesh power sector \nhas so far been undertaken at the entity level, limiting efficient use ", "  v\nof  financial  and  human  resources.  To  achieve  sustained  and \nbalanced growth of the power sector, the Government drafted a \nmedium-term, sector-wide capacity development program in July \n2006 covering a wide spectrum of power sector operations. This \nespecially  addresses  corporate  and  financial  management, \ninformation  and  communication  technology,  long-term  system \nplanning  and  future  project  preparations,  good  governance, \ncustomer  relations,  research  and  development,  and  human \nresource  development  and  training.  This  coordinated  capacity \ndevelopment program will ensure balanced capacity development \namong sector entities.  \n   \nOutputs  Part A: Clean Energy Capacity Expansion.

Once the cofinancing is committed, The ADB loan will be \nreduced accordingly. \nSource: ADB estimates. \n   \nLoan Amount and Terms  (i) A loan of $400.00 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources \nwill help finance procurement and consulting services associated \nwith parts A, B, C, and D. This loan will have a term of 25 years, a \ngrace period of 5 years, an interest rate determined in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate-based lending facility, a \ncommitment charge of 0.75% per annum, a front-end fee of 1.0% \n(the fee will be waived if the loan is approved before June 2008 \nand  the  borrower  has  no  arrears);  and  (ii)  a  loan  in  various \ncurrencies equivalent to SDR3,371,000 ($5.0 million equivalent) \nfrom ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources to help finance part E, with a \nterm of 32 years, grace period of 8 years, and interest charge of \n1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum \nthereafter.   \n   \nRelending Terms  The loan proceeds will be relent to BPDB [and later transferred to \nits  successor  company,  provisionally  called  Northwest  Power \nGeneration Company Limited (NWPGC)] for part A, PGCB for part \nB, DPDC for part C, and DESCO for part D pursuant to subsidiary \nloan agreements with terms and conditions acceptable to ADB. \nRelending terms to these entities will include a repayment period \nof 20 years including a 5-year grace period, and interest at the \nrate of 5.5% per annum. Foreign exchange risk will be assumed \nby  the  corresponding  entities  during  the  life  of  the  respective \nsubsidiary loan, and thereafter by the Borrower.  \n \nThe loan proceeds for part E will be provided to MPEMR. \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  Until 30 June 2010 \n   \nEstimated Project  31 December 2009 \nCompletion Date \n   \nExecuting Agencies  BPDB and the successor company, NWPGC, will be the EA for \npart A, while PGCB will be the EA for part B, DPDC for part C, \nand DESCO for part D. The Power Division of MPEMR will be the \nEA for part E.  \n   ", "  vii\nImplementation  Direct supervision and monitoring of project implementation and \nArrangements  operational performance will be the responsibility of the EAs and \nGovernment. The EAs will prepare separate progress reports for \ntheir  respective  components  and  submit  these  to  ADB  on  a \nquarterly basis within 20 days from the end of each quarter. ADB \nwill review the implementation and operation of the project based \non these reports and meet with the EAs and the Government \nsemiannually to discuss project progress. ADB will also monitor \nthe overall performance of the EAs. \n   \nProcurement  Procurement  of  goods  and  services  to  be  financed  under  the \nproject  loan  will  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). \nFor such procurement, bid packaging and specifications will be \nprepared  in  a  manner  to  ensure  maximum  competition  under \ninternational  competitive  bidding.  A  third-party  pre-shipment \ninspection provision will be adopted to ensure quality of goods \nand equipment to be procured.   \n   \nConsulting Services  International consultants associated with national consultants will \nassist BPDB/NWPGC for part A and PGCB for part B to prepare \nbidding  documents,  including  basic  design,  evaluation  of  bids, \nfinal design approval, and project implementation supervision that \nincludes approval of final design. They will also assist the Power \nDivision of MPEMR in capacity development under part E. All \nconsultants will be recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines \non the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time) \nand  the  quality-  and  cost-based  selection  method  will  be \nimplemented.  \n   \nProject Benefits and  The combined interventions of the proposed project and program \nBeneficiaries  loans  are  strongly  interlinked  and  will  further  enhance  the \nGovernment\u2019s ongoing reform program, strengthen the financial \nposition of sector entities, enhance public-private partnership, and \nimprove  sector  and  corporate  governance.  Thereby,  they  will \nassure sustained growth in the sector and gradually relieve the \nGovernment of providing financial support to the sector.  \n \nThe project loan is expected to reduce system losses and improve \nquality  of  supply,  leading  to  more  efficient  use  of  energy  and \nmaking  more  power  available  to  support  sustained  economic \ngrowth, while offsetting growth in green house gas emissions. The \n300 MW of additional clean-fuel power generation capacity, 900 \nMVA  of  additional  transmission  capacity,  and  1,020  MVA  of \nadditional distribution capacity under the project loan are expected \nto result in more efficient and reliable service delivery, particularly \nbenefiting  230,000  new  consumers  (domestic,  commercial, \nirrigation, industrial and others). It will also directly benefit 820,000 \nexisting consumers in Dhaka area by providing reliable power \nsupply. Reliable power supply will help manufacturing and service \nindustries,  including  the  garment  sector  that  employs  several \n ", "viii  \nmillion poor people, particularly poor women. Poor and vulnerable \nconsumers, including hospitals, schools, and other social facilities, \nwhich are often the hardest hit by inadequate power supply, load \nshedding, and poor quality of power, are likely to benefit directly \nfrom the project loan. A positive, direct impact on local labor is \nexpected  during  implementation  of  the  project  loan,  and  an \nindirect impact will occur due to the enhanced income-generating \nopportunities from increased access to electricity.   \n \nThe program loan will result in better service to the public through \nimproved governance in the sector. The functioning independent \nsector regulator will provide transparent consultative procedures \nfor issuing tariff rulings that protect consumer interests. Product \ncosts  might  also  decrease  due  to  price  rationalization  and \nefficiency gains. Employees will benefit from a new management \nstructure and skills training. Continued sector reforms supported \nby  the  program  loan  will  facilitate  power  sector  entities  to \ntransition from budget \u201csinks\u201d to public revenue sources, freeing \nup government funds for critical social investments.    \n   \nRisks and Assumptions  The Program faces several risks, and particularly those related to \nsustaining political commitment to underpin the reform process, \nregulatory capacity to ensure BERC\u2019s independence and to make \ntimely  regulatory  decisions,  governance  and  corruption,  and \nimplementation delays.  \n \nPolitical Commitment. The success of the Program depends on \nthe Government\u2019s strong commitments to power sector reforms \nand,  more  specifically,  to  successfully  creating  a  new  power \ngeneration company and transferring operational authority for the \nDESA area to DPDC to implement the project loan. There is a risk \nthat  these  actions  may  be  affected  by  future  political \ndevelopments. However, this risk is considered low as the sector \nhas comprehensive experience from previous projects in setting \nup new companies and transferring operational authorities. The \nGovernment has also shown consistent commitments to reforming \nthe sector since adopting a power sector reform policy paper in \n1994. Furthermore, the success of corporatized entities clearly \nindicates the direction of the reform, which is widely recognized by \nvarious stakeholders.  \n \nRegulatory Capacity. Parliament passed the Bangladesh Energy \nRegulatory Commission Act 2003 to give the regulatory body a \nwider mandate and independence. This Act provides the legal \nframework  for  an  independent  sector  regulator.  With  the \nframework  in  place  for  BERC  to  operate,  it  is  now  up  to  the \nGovernment to ensure that regulatory actions are taken based on \ncommercial principles and without outside interference. Given its \ncentral role in various sector reform activities, BERC should be \nable to undertake its mandate with adequate human resources \nand an operating budget. Recent preparation of the Government\u2019s ", "  ix\n3-year power sector reform road map is a good move forward, as \nit  provides  a  specific  target  for  a  fully  functional  BERC.  The \nProgram supports the road map\u2019s implementation by underpinning \nthe Government\u2019s initial actions to make BERC fully operational. \n \nGovernance. Good governance is an essential precondition for \nsustainable  development  in  Bangladesh\u2019s  power  sector.  The \nGovernment has put good governance at the center of power \nsector reform policies. Various measures have been included in \nthe Program\u2019s design to promote good governance and mitigate \nthe risk of corruption by enhancing predictability, transparency, \nand accountability in doing business. These measures include, \namong others, continued corporatization and commercialization of \nsector entities, strengthening the sector regulator, and instituting a \nstrengthened financial management and procurement system. \n \nProject Readiness. Previous ADB-financed projects in the power \nsector in Bangladesh have experienced repeated delays in project \nimplementation, frequently caused by the EAs\u2019 inadequate project \nreadiness. This has resulted in delayed government approvals for \nprojects\u2019 component proposals, slow progress in land acquisition, \nand cumbersome procurement procedures. Taking into account \nthese lessons learned, the EAs and Government have undertaken \nvarious  actions  with  regard  to  this  project.  The  EAs  have \nappointed  the  required  project  teams,  including  the  project \ndirectors, for implementing the project components. In addition, all \nthe development project proposals have already been prepared \nby the EAs and approved by the Government. Land acquisitions \nfor  constructing  the  project  components  have  also  been \ncompleted  or  are  in  advanced  stages.  As  all  the  project  loan \ncomponents  will  be  implemented  by  the  corporatized  entities, \naccelerated  procurement  processes  are  anticipated  since  the \ndecisions  can  be  made  by  the  respective  board  of  directors \nwithout referring them to the Government. Apart from these, draft \nbidding documents for procuring goods, works, and services and \ndraft  requests  for  proposals  for  recruiting  implementation \nconsultants have already been submitted to ADB by the EAs, and \nseveral bidding documents have been issued to accelerate the \nfront-end activities.  \n ", "x   ", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on three proposed \nloans to the People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh for the Sustainable Power Sector Development \nProgram (the Program). The design and monitoring framework of the Program is presented in \nAppendix 1.  \n \nII.  THE SECTOR: PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n2.  Although Bangladesh has performed generally well on the macroeconomic front over the \npast decade, inadequate electricity supply has been a major constraint on economic growth and \npoverty reduction. The electrification ratio is still very low, as only a third of the population has \naccess to electricity. At just about 158 kilowatt-hours (kWh) annually, per capita generation is \namong the lowest in the world. The country\u2019s current dependable generating capacity is about \n4,120 megawatts (MW), while peak demand is about 4,700 MW. In fiscal year (FY) 2005, load \nshedding in the range of 7\u2013770 MW was required on 287 days for a total of 1,433 hours. In \nFY2004, this was in a range of 2\u2013694 MW on 232 days and totaled 951 hours. As shown in \nTable  1,  load  shedding  increased  in  frequency  and  intensity  until  the  late  1990s  and  the \nsituation improved somewhat in the early 2000s. Over the past 3 years, however, the situation \nhas worsened as load growth has expanded faster than supply capacity. This trend is expected \nto continue in the near future. Erratic power supply tends to increase consumers\u2019 unwillingness \nto pay their bills, which leads to shortages of funds for maintenance. This, in turn, causes supply \ninterruptions to industry and residences, hampers commercial activity, and jeopardizes public \nsafety. Furthermore, this situation encourages development of costly backup self-generation. \nThe  Government\u2019s  highest  priorities  are  to  minimize  the  number,  duration,  and  impact  of \nload-shedding events.   \n \nTable 1: Trend in Power Supply and Demand in Bangladesh \n(megawatts) \n \nItem  FY1994  FY1999  FY2002  FY2003  FY2004  FY2005 \nInstalled Capacity  2,608  3,603  4,230  4,680  4,680  4,995 \nPeak Demand  \u2014  2,881  3,659  3,947  4,259  4,597 \nServed Generation  1,875  2,449  3,217  3,428  3,592  3,720 \nLoad Shedding  23\u2013500  16\u2013774  5\u2013367  5\u2013468  2\u2013694  7\u2013770 \n\u2014 = not available, FY = fiscal year. \nSource: Bangladesh Power Development Board. \n \n3.  The power sector in Bangladesh performed poorly until the early 1990s. The major \nconstraints in the sector were (i) lack of institutional capability, (ii) unavailability of long-term \ndomestic capital for financing investments, (iii) limited foreign exchange availability, (iv) poor \nmanagement systems and procedures, (v) low employee commitment, and (vi) institutional \nweaknesses in governance. To improve the sector\u2019s performance, the Government adopted a \npolicy paper in 1994 entitled Power Sector Reforms in Bangladesh (PSRB) in consultation with \nmajor development partners.1 With initiation of these reforms, the sector\u2019s organization has \nchanged. Until FY1998, Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB) was responsible for all \n                                                 \n1  ADB, World Bank, Department of International Development of the United Kingdom, Japan Bank for International \nCooperation, Kreditanstalt f\u00fcr Wiederaufbau of Germany, and United States Agency for International Development.  ", "2 \ngeneration and most transmission in the country, as well as for distribution in district towns, \nmunicipalities,  and  some  rural  areas,  while  Dhaka  Electric  Supply  Authority  (DESA)  was \nresponsible for distribution in the greater Dhaka area, including the capital city. Today, several \npublic-private  and  private  sector  entities  are  licensed  to  construct  and  operate  generating \nfacilities. Power Grid Company of Bangladesh Limited (PGCB) has taken over all of BPDB\u2019s \ntransmission  assets  and  most  of  DESA\u2019s  transmission  assets,  and  Dhaka  Electric  Supply \nCompany Limited (DESCO) has taken over distribution assets in some part of Dhaka city. \nElectricity distribution in most rural areas of Bangladesh is the responsibility of the 70 rural \nelectricity cooperatives (PBSs), which are organized, initially funded, and monitored by Rural \nElectrification  Board  (REB).  Dhaka  Power  Distribution  Company  Limited  (DPDC)  was \nestablished in 2005 to take over DESA\u2019s distribution assets. \n \n4.  The changes in the business environment and organization resulting from adoption of \nthe PSRB have yielded notable improvements in the power sector entities\u2019 operational and \nfinancial performance. In particular, the sector\u2019s overall system losses against gross generation \nhave been reduced significantly\u2014from 37.2% in FY1994 to 25.0% in FY 2005. For the same \nperiod, the sector\u2019s ratio of average collection to import has been improved from about 66% to \nover 80%, as shown in Table 2 below. Further sector analysis is presented in Appendix 2. \n \nTable 2: Performance of Distribution Entities \n(%) \n \nItem  FY1994  FY1999  FY2002  FY2003  FY2004  FY2005 \nSystem Losses             \nBPDB  30.3  29.7  23.2  20.7  21.3  20.0 \nDESA  32.8  29.9  35.6  30.9  33.7  30.0 \nDESCO  \u2014  40.5  26.7  21.2  19.2  16.7 \nREB  15.6  18.6  16.7  17.3  15.6  13.8 \nWZPDC  \u2014  \u2014  \u2014  \u2014  \u2014  21.4 \nOverall Power System  37.2  35.8  32.0  28.5  27.2  25.0 \nCollection to Import             \nBPDBa  62.5  55.3  74.6  76.8  78.5  80.1 \nDESA  54.6  57.2  72.7  72.8  77.4  70.0 \nDESCO  \u2014  35.2  65.3  69.5  70.9  80.9 \nREB  83.5  76.5  84.4  82.8  83.5  85.8 \nWZPDC  \u2014  \u2014  \u2014  \u2014  \u2014  87.8 \n\u2014 = not available, BPDB = Bangladesh Power Development Board, DESA = Dhaka Electric Supply Authority, \nDESCO = Dhaka Electric Supply Company Limited, FY = fiscal year, REB = Rural Electrification Board, WZPDC = \nWest Zone Power Distribution Company Limited.  \na Collection to generation. \nSources: Power sector entities\u2019 reports. \n \nB.  Issues and Opportunities \n  1.  Load Restrictions and System Constraints \n \n5.  Over the past 10 years, electricity consumption in Bangladesh grew at an average \nannual rate of 8.1%. The ADB-financed power system master plan update (PSMPU) 2 estimates \nthat demand for electricity will grow at an annual rate of about 8.0% for the next 10 years, and \n                                                 \n2  ADB. 2004. Technical Assistance to the People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh for Preparing the Power Sector \nDevelopment Program II. Manila.  \n ", "3 \nabout 20% of the additional capacity by 2025 will be required to serve peak load. Even if all \npresently planned power plants are constructed as scheduled, a shortfall of generation capacity \nof over 2,000 MW is expected by 2010 and over 5,500 MW by 2015, of which 750 MW would be \npeaking capacity. To meet the Government\u2019s goal of providing reliable and quality electricity at \naffordable prices to all the population by 2020, an additional 12,000 MW of generation capacity \nwill be required. \n \n6.  Limitations in the existing transmission system also require immediate attention. The \nrapidly growing demand requires a corresponding increase in the capability of the transmission \nsystem to evacuate the power from new plants and make it available to existing and new \nsubstations. Some areas in the country are presently served through weak 33-kilovolt (kV) \ndistribution links that face frequent outages, provide low voltages, and create maintenance \nproblems.  The  PSMPU\u2019s  least-cost  expansion  plan  concludes  that  additional  transmission \ncapacity of 4,875 megavolt-ampere (MVA) of 230/132 kV transformers will be required by 2010 \nand another 4,650 MVA by 2015. Existing capacity is 3,925 MVA. More than three times the \ncurrent large transformer capacity will be necessary to meet demand reliably by 2015. \n \n7.  Expansion of the distribution systems in Dhaka has struggled to keep up with the rapid \ngrowth  in  demand.  Several  33/11  kV  substations  are  more  than  30  years  old.  The  main \nequipment and circuit breaker protection systems have deteriorated and the transformers are \noverloaded, contributing to even faster deterioration. Load shedding remains the only tool to \ncontrol system overload. Few substations have backup transformers to provide reliable and \nstable power supply to feed the load of the substation in the event of an outage. As a result of \nlong runs of low-voltage lines that are often overloaded, low voltage is a problem both at the \nsupply side of the substations and at the demand side. Lower power factors exacerbate voltage \nproblems, but many of the capacitors installed to help control power factor are not functional, \nand most of the power factor meters are defective. Operating under such conditions contributes \nto high losses as well as faster deterioration of equipment condition and performance. Dhaka\u2019s \ndistribution  systems  face  the  challenge  of  rehabilitating  the  existing  system  while  meeting \ndemand that is expected to double by 2015. \n \n8.  The PSMPU estimates that the total investment required for generation and transmission \nby 2025 will be about $10.5 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively. It is also estimated that about \n$6.3 billion will be required for distribution to serve the generation and transmission expansions. \nDetails of the total estimated investment requirements are shown in Table 3. \n \nTable 3: Estimated Investment Requirements through 2025  \n($ million) \n \nFiscal Year  Generation  Transmission   Distribution   Total \n2006\u20132010  3,227  563  2,041  5,831 \n2011\u20132015  2,232  175  1,296  3,703 \n2016\u20132020  2,871  315  1,715  4,901 \n2021\u20132025  2,172  145  1,248  3,565 \nTotal  10,502  1,198  6,300  18,000 \nSources: power system master plan update and Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n  2.  Regulatory Framework \n \n9.  Effective regulation of the sector is crucial to ensuring sustainability of the sector entities, \nestablishing a level playing field for all entities, and providing confidence to potential investors. \n ", "4 \nTo achieve this, Bangladesh Energy Regulatory Commission (BERC) was established in April \n2004 as an independent energy sector regulator under the Energy Regulatory Commission Act \n2003 to (i) set electricity tariffs and determine the corresponding performance norms; (ii) collect, \nverify, and disseminate power statistics; (iii) review and approve long-term power planning; (iv) \ncreate and maintain a nondiscriminatory and commercial business environment in the sector; \nand (v) adjudicate disputes between sector entities. The United States Agency for International \nDevelopment (USAID) has provided technical assistance (TA) to establish BERC and to provide \ninstitutional  capacity  building  and  training  by  identifying  problems  and  introducing  relevant \nexperience from other countries. With this support from USAID and temporary staff deputed \nfrom the Government, BERC has finalized its licensing regulations and drafted tariff regulations. \nMainly due to the absence of an approved organogram,3 however, BERC is unable to recruit \nsuitable staff, and that impedes its full functioning. \n \n  3.  Financial Performance and Electricity Tariff \n \n10.  The Government and power sector entities in Bangladesh have taken tangible steps to \nenhance the financial performance of the sector entities. In parallel with the Government\u2019s effort \nto instill a new corporate culture in the sector through corporatization and commercialization, the \ntwo major companies of the power sector, PGCB and DESCO, have undertaken a number of \nreform measures to improve their operational efficiency and financial positions. These include (i) \na  change  in  PGCB  billing  procedures  for  wheeling  charges  from  asset-based  billing  to \nenergy-based billing at the distribution end, (ii) load balancing among different transformers, (iii) \nexpansion of computerized billing and ledger updating systems, (iv) upgrading of their power \nsupply systems, (v) expanded use of prepaid meters and capacitor banks, and (vi) time-of-use \ntariffs  for  consumers  connected  at  33  kV  and  11  kV.  PGCB  and  DESCO  have  become \nfinancially self-reliant since FY2004. They reported net profit before tax of Tk422 million and \nTk551 million, respectively, in FY2005. \n \n11.  In contrast to PGCB and DESCO, BPDB and DESA have continuously made large \nlosses,  with  a  damaging  impact  on  Government  finances.  These  entities  are  technically \ninsolvent, as their current liabilities exceed realizable current assets and they have accumulated \nlarge unmet debt service liabilities to the Government. As of 30 June 2005, BPDB had debt \nservice arrears to the Government of Tk57.55 billion (equivalent to about $820 million). DESA \nhas accumulated significant liabilities that include unpaid import bills from BPDB and wheeling \ncharges from PGCB. As of 30 June 2005, these liabilities were equivalent to 1,049 days (34 \nmonths) of DESA\u2019s average energy import bill. There is no likelihood of these amounts being \nrepaid. Rather, these liabilities will continue to grow under the present policies. \n \n12.  There are three types of tariffs in the power sector in Bangladesh, namely, (i) wholesale \ntariffs, (ii) transmission wheeling charges, and (iii) retail distribution tariffs charged to end-use \nconsumers. Up until 2003, the Government had a semiannual automatic power tariff adjustment \nformula to reflect fuel price changes and local currency fluctuations. With establishment of \nBERC in April 2004, the responsibility for power tariff setting was delegated to BERC. Especially \nbecause BERC has not yet been fully functional, however, there has been no tariff adjustment \nsince September 2003, despite significant fuel price hikes and local currency depreciations. \nThat exacerbates the financial difficulties of the sector entities. A detailed tariff analysis has \nbeen undertaken. It is provided in Supplementary Appendix A, and its summary is in Appendix 3. \n \n                                                 \n3  In Bangladesh, an organogram generally includes the organizational chart, pay structure, conditions of services, \nrecruitment procedures, and job descriptions.  \n ", "5 \n13.  The tariff analysis reveals that BPDB, in particular, is facing a serious financial hardship, \nas it has to absorb the losses arising from the difference between the wholesale tariffs and its \npooled generation cost. While its pooled average cost of generation is Tk2.26 per kWh, BPDB \nsells electricity to distribution entities at Tk1.84\u2013Tk1.94 per kWh, aggregating to losses of about \nTk9.30 billion per annum. The tariff analysis shows that PGCB has a tariff that enables it to earn \na profit, with wheeling charges of Tk0.23 per kWh for bulk delivery to distribution entities and \nthat  the  existing  transmission  wheeling  tariff  may  be  retained  until  FY2007.  Similarly  to \nwholesale generation tariffs, retail tariffs are not structured for cost recovery and are essentially \ninflexible  to  such  external  price  fluctuations  as  increases  in  fuel  costs,  local  currency \ndepreciation, and inflation. The tariff analysis concludes that sizeable tariff increases will be \nneeded to restore balance between tariffs and the underlying cost of service. Increases should \nbe spread over a number of years, however, to minimize the adverse impact downstream. If \nbulk supply tariff and retail tariffs are raised by 10% on average now and there will be further \nreal  increases  of  5%  in  FY2009  and  FY2010,  the  tariffs  would  be  brought  into  line  with \nunderlying cost of service by 2010. In view of the urgency to address the tariff issues, the \nGovernment has initiated a proposal to increase the wholesale tariff by about 10% and the retail \ntariff by some 5%. Pursuant to the BERC Act, a public hearing was held by BERC in early \nOctober 2006 for the proposed tariff increase. The tariff increase became effective on 1 March \n2007.  \n \n14.  Given the high cost of generation, which is partly due to supply shortages that force \nBPDB to purchase power from all available generation units regardless of cost and operational \nefficiency, the Government is now pursuing several less-costly natural gas-fired independent \npower producer (IPP) projects totaling about 1,400 MW of new generation capacity. These are \nin contract-awarding stage or bidding stages. In parallel, the Government is pursuing 1,000 MW \nof gas-fired plants through public sector investments on the basis of the least-cost option. Apart \nfrom the effort for tariff increase and measures to construct less-costly natural gas-fired power \nplants to bring down the overall generation cost, the Government is taking a multifaceted \napproach to achieve a sustainable power sector through a combination of various measures, \nincluding (i) putting BERC into full operation to gradually implement the cost recovery principle \nin tariff settings pursuant to the Government\u2019s policy, (ii) further restructuring the power sector \nentities to improve their operational performance as envisaged in the Government\u2019s reform \nprogram, (iii) implementing various system loss reduction programs, and (iv) preparing and \nimplementing a financial restructuring plan for the sector entities, in particular BPDB and DESA. \n \n15.  As autonomous corporate governance is a precondition for achieving financial health, \nthe  Cabinet  Committee  on  Economic  Affairs  of  the  Government  approved  proposals  for \ncorporatizing BPDB and DESA in June and July 2004, respectively. On 25 October 2005, DESA \nwas incorporated as DPDC to take over DESA\u2019s distribution systems. To allow corporatization \nof BPDB, a draft memorandum and articles of association have been prepared for review by the \nGovernment. Corporatizaton of BPDB and DESA, including human resource issues such as the \nemployee  retrenchment  plan  is  being  assisted  by  ADB  TA4626-BAN4 and  TA3978-BAN,5 \nrespectively. In parallel with the corporatization process, ADB TA4379-BAN (footnote 2) has \nassisted the Government by preparing a draft financial restructuring plan for BPDB and DESA. \n \n                                                 \n4 ADB. 2005.

Bangladesh\u2019s economy is widely perceived to suffer from weak governance. Despite \ngood  progress  in  many  social  indicators,  perceived  corruption  adds  to  the  costs  of  doing \nbusiness  and  reduces  the  nation\u2019s  competitiveness  and  attractiveness  for  foreign  direct \ninvestment. Significant governance challenges in Bangladesh occur at three levels: national, \nsector,  and  corporate.  At  the  national  level,  ADB  has  attempted  to  support  anticorruption \nmeasures through TA 4140-BAN6 by promoting medium- to long-term development of collective \nanticorruption efforts at various institutions, including in the power sector. This TA has built on \nenactment  of  the  Anticorruption  Commission  Act  and  the  establishment  in  2004  of  the \nAnticorruption Commission. ADB has launched TA4734-BAN7 to support capacity building to \nmake the commission operational. In parallel, ADB is assisting the Government in preparing a \ncomprehensive national integrity strategy under TA4744-BAN.8 Public procurement procedures \nthat are universally associated with high levels of corruption are addressed in a major reform \nprogram supported by ADB, World Bank, and other development partners, and the Public \nProcurement  Act  was  passed  by  Parliament  in  2006.  The  Government  has  recently \ndemonstrated  strong  commitment  to  pursuing  critical  governance  reforms  with  focus  on \ncombating  corruption,  ensuring  the  effectiveness  and  independence  of  the  judiciary,  and \ndepoliticizing the civil service. It has already reconstituted the Anticorruption Commission with \nnew commissioners, framed new laws to tackle corruption; taken tough legal and prosecutorial \nactions; and ratified the United Nations Convention Against Corruption.  \n \n17.  Good governance, at both sector and corporate levels, is invariably emphasized in the \nGovernment\u2019s various power sector reform policy papers, including the PSRB, the Vision and \nPolicy Statement for Power Sector Reforms issued in 2000, and, most recently, the 3-year \nsector reform road map. Among the ways sector- and corporate-level governance is addressed \nin Bangladesh\u2019s power sector are by continuing to corporatize and commercialize sector entities \nand strengthening regulatory functions. It is widely recognized that this experience to date has \nyielded positive results, and continued restructuring of the sector entities through corporatization \nand commercialization is a crucial step in promoting good governance. The amendment of the \nElectricity Act in 2006, moreover, introduced severe penalties, including imprisonment, for theft, \npilfering  electricity,  meter  tempering,  and  other  crimes.  Specific  governance  risk  mitigation \nmeasures taken in designing the proposed program are described in paras. 60\u201361. \n \n  5.  Private Sector Participation  \n \n18.  As the Government realized that the investment requirements for the power sector would \nexceed the resources available in the public sector and could crowd out investment in other key \nsectors, it took a policy decision in 1994 to invite private sector participation in generation, and it \nintroduced  a  private  power  generation  policy  in  1996.  The  Government  made  efforts  to \nstreamline its administrative and commercial procedures, and the private sector responded \nfavorably. Since introduction of this policy, new capacity of 1,290 MW (in a total of seven plants) \nhas so far been established by IPPs. Additional capacity of about 1,400 MW is planned to be \nestablished in the near future. In FY2005, IPPs9 produced 8,185 MWh of electricity, which \n                                                 \n6 ADB. 2003.

ADB has consistently \nsupported  the  Government  in  promoting  private  sector  participation  in  the  power  sector, \nincluding TA for soliciting private sector implementation of the Meghnaghat Power Station.10  \n \n19.  Despite past success, Bangladesh, like many other developing countries, has recently \nfaced difficulties in mobilizing further private capital for expanding power generating capacity. A \nworldwide trend shows that private investors\u2019 interest for IPPs in developing countries has fallen \noff, and the number and value of transactions involving these investors are well below their \npeaks in the late 1990s. Several factors are generally considered to have contributed to the \nfalloff: (i) a financial crisis in 1997 that steeply devalued local currencies and undermined the \nsustainability of investments, (ii) conditions in international capital markets and a drop in the \nmarket capitalizations of investors\u2019 assets that affected their ability to raise capital for new \ninvestments, and (iii) concerns about the stability and enforceability of legal and regulatory \nframeworks under power sector reform. To promote further private sector participation and \npublic-private partnership in the power sector in Bangladesh, ADB has approved a TA project,11 \nwhich aims to review and analyze current hindrances to private sector participation, recommend \nmeasures to remove those impediments, and provide several public-private partnership models \nthat may be adopted in the power sector in Bangladesh.  \n \n20.  To tap local private capital for developing the power sector, the Government gave its \napproval in March 2004 for PGCB to issue, in one or more tranches, tax-free bonds with \nmaturities of 7\u201310 years and in total amount up to Tk2.0 billion to finance the local currency cost \nof  constructing  the  national  load  dispatch  center.  PGCB  appointed  an  issue  manager  in \nFebruary 2004, then decided to issue the bonds in several tranches. PGCB is now ready to \nissue the bonds when markets are favorable. Furthermore, in a first for the Bangladesh public \nsector, DESCO shares were directly listed on the local stock exchange in June 2006 with a very \nfavorable market response, and PGCB shares were listed in October 2006. \n \n  6.

The major sources of external funding for the Bangladesh power sector are ADB, World \nBank, Japan Bank for International Cooperation, United Kingdom Department for International \nDevelopment, Kreditanstalt f\u00fcr Wiederaufbau (KfW), and USAID. ADB has assisted generation, \ntransmission,  and  distribution  of  power  in  urban  and  semi-urban  areas.  Japan  Bank  for \nInternational  Cooperation  has  concentrated  its  assistance  on  power  generation  and  rural \nelectrification projects, and it is now considering to finance a 360 MW power plant in Haripur, \naugment transmission systems, and promote renewable energy. Department for International \nDevelopment has financed transmission and distribution in the Dhaka area and is currently \nengaged in expanding REB. USAID has been instrumental in establishing and funding REB and \nthe first PBSs, as well as in establishing and capacity building at BERC. USAID continues to \nprovide technical support to REB and for making BERC fully functional, as well as to provide \nassistance  for  regional  cooperation  and  renewable  energy.  While  KfW  has  assisted  in \naugmenting  generating  capacity  and  reinforcing  transmission  projects;  it  will  emphasize \ntransmission, renewable energy, and energy efficiency. World Bank had earlier financed power \ngeneration and distribution projects in smaller towns and rural areas. Since 2002, World Bank \nhas been supporting REB in expanding its operation, and it has a plan to finance peaking power \n                                                 \n10 ADB. 1995.

It also is considering financing corporatization of BPDB\u2019s \nsouthern  zone  distribution  network,  rural  electrification,  and  renewable  energy.  External \nassistance to the power sector is summarized in Appendix 4. \n \n22.  There is an active energy sector local consultative group in Bangladesh comprising \nrepresentatives from the development partners and Government. They meet regularly in Dhaka \nto discuss various sector issues as well as assistance strategies and programs. ADB has, as \nthe lead coordinator of this consultative group, organized coordination meetings since 1992, \nthereby contributing to the formulation of reforms and identification of reform-linked projects in \nthe sector. Most recently, in November 2005, ADB organized a coordination meeting in Dhaka \nto review the Government\u2019s reform process, provide feedback on the Government\u2019s draft 3-year \npower sector reform road map, and help the Government finalize the road map. Considering the \npower sector\u2019s vast investment requirements and the complexity of power sector reforms, the \nproposed program has been formulated in close collaboration with other development partners.  \n \n  7.  Lessons Learned \n \n23.  Since Bangladesh joined ADB in 1973, the power sector has received 18 public sector \nloans and one private sector investment, totaling about $1.3 billion, to improve the capacity and \nquality of power supply. ADB has also provided 22 TA grants, totaling about $14.0 million. ADB \nrecently evaluated its power sector assistance program12 in Bangladesh. It found that ADB\u2019s \nassistance has been relevant, as it has addressed the sector\u2019s changing needs over time, and \nthat ADB\u2019s consistent support through reform-linked projects has been a key factor behind the \nsector\u2019s  ongoing  drive  for  commercialization,  thereby  helping  to  maintain  the  country\u2019s \nmacroeconomic stability. The evaluation also recognizes that ADB\u2019s gradual approach for sector \nreform has facilitated change, and it goes on to recommend sustained support. Still needed, \nhowever,  are  continuing  and  more  rapid  reforms  in  creating  an  independent  regulator, \ncorporatization of BPDB and DESA, mutual independence of sector entities whose transactions \nare governed by commercial contracts, reform of wholesale and retail tariffs to reflect costs of \nsupply, sector recapitalization, and a sound financial policy for the sector. The evaluation report \nalso concludes that, given the success of the individual projects and new sector entities, ADB\u2019s \napproach clearly indicates the direction that future reform programs should take. Another finding \nis that the pace of privatization in an environment such as that in Bangladesh, especially in \ntransmission and distribution, is likely to be slow. As such, it is important to prioritize reform \ninitiatives in these key areas.  \n \n24.  In  December  2003,  ADB  approved  two  loans  for  the  Power  Sector  Development \nProgram (PSDP),13 one program loan of $100 million, and one project loan of $186 million. The \nprogram loan was to provide support and incentives to the Government for power sector reform \nactivities through financial stabilization of two major transmission and distribution companies, \nnamely PGCB and DESCO, launching of BERC, optimizing generation costs on a national basis, \nand restructuring of power sector entities. The project loan was to provide financial assistance \nto expand peak load generation capacity at Siddhirganj, construct a new national load dispatch \ncenter, and strengthen distribution systems in northwestern Bangladesh. Under the program \nloan, two tranches of $50 million each were linked to sequenced policy reform targets. The first \ntranche was released in August 2004 and the second in December 2005 upon compliance by \n                                                 \n12 ADB. 2004.

A major breakthrough was the emergence of a \nnew culture of accountability for electricity used by the Government and its agencies. This \nhelped  to  substantially  reduce  the  outstanding  dues  owed  by  the  Government  and  its \nagencies.14 The  power  sector\u2019s  two  major  companies,  PGCB  and  DESCO,  have  become \nprofitable organizations since 2004. The PSDP also supported launching of BERC and laid a \nfoundation for restructuring the remaining key power sector entities, BPDB and DESA. While the \nGovernment has made substantial progress in meeting the overall objectives of the PSDP and \nhas complied with major loan covenants, implementation of the project loan is experiencing slow \nprogress,  particularly  in  procuring  Siddhirganj  power  station,  mainly  because  of  delays  in \nrecruiting the implementation consultant.15  \n \n  8.  Government Development Strategy \n \n25.  In 2000, building on the PSRB, the Government issued its Vision and Policy Statement \nfor Power Sector Reforms. This clarified specific details of the structural arrangements for power \ngeneration,  transmission  and  distribution  along  with  the  principles  of  corporatization, \ncommercialization, cost-reflective and equitable tariffs, and greater private sector participation in \ngeneration as follows:  \n \n(i)  Generation.  Separation  of  all  existing  units  through  a  corporatized  national \npower generation entity; power stations under construction and all new power \nstations to be profit centers and incorporated as independent companies; new \ngeneration to reflect a least-cost expansion plan based on the supply of private \nand public resources.  \n(ii)  Transmission.  To  be  expanded  in  tandem  with  generation  capacity;  the \ntransmission grid to be owned and operated by a corporatized entity in the public \nsector (i.e., PGCB).  \n(iii)  Distribution.  Creation  of  a  number  of  separate  distribution  entities  to  be \nincorporated under the Companies Act of 1994; private capital and management \nparticipation; REB to continue functioning.  \n(iv)  Tariffs. To be set at progressively cost-reflective levels that improve efficiency in \ngeneration, transmission, and distribution while promoting commercial returns.  \n(v)  Regulation. Regulatory commission to be established.  \n(vi)  Financial. Restructured entities to be given the opportunity to start operations \nwith clean balance sheets; fiscal regime to be made neutral irrespective of the \nownership structure of power entities. \n \n26.  As a result of these initiatives, the Government has achieved (i) creation of a competitive, \ndiverse market with independent public and private generation companies; (ii) restructuring of \nthe  sector  by  transferring  all  transmission  assets  and  operations  to  a  new  transmission \ncompany; (iii) creation of a competitive environment by establishing several sector entities; and \n(iv) establishment of the energy regulatory commission, BERC. \n \n27.  Subsequently, in 2006, the Government issued its 3-year reform road map through \nintensive consultations with various stakeholders and key development partners. This road map \n                                                 \n14 The outstanding debts of the Government ministries and divisions were reduced by 58% from about Tk3.3 billion in \nJune 2002 to about Tk1.4 billion in December 2005. In the same period, the outstanding debts of the Government\u2019s \nautonomous and semi-autonomous bodies were reduced by 49% from about Tk6.8 billion to some Tk3.5 billion. In \nMarch 2007, these have been further reduced to Tk0.7 billion and Tk2.9 billion, respectively. \n15 Nevertheless, construction work of Siddhirganj power station has started in early 2007.  \n ", "10 \nsets  out  the  detailed  reform  and  investment  program  for  2006\u20132008  with  a  detailed \nimplementation plan for the Government\u2019s vision statements. The 3-year road map is based on \nthe  lessons  learned  in  establishing  sector  entities,  particularly  the  need  to  introduce  new \nmanagement  structures  and  a  commercial  culture,  resolve  employee  issues,  and  provide \nsufficient autonomy and improved governance. The main results to be achieved over the next 3 \nyears include further unbundling of electricity supply into commercially viable generation and \ndistribution companies. The sector road map is summarized in Appendix 5. \n \n  9.  ADB\u2019s Sector Strategy \n \n28.  ADB has developed its strategy for the power sector in consultation with the Government \nand other key development partners involved in the sector. In parallel with its continued support \nfor expanding and upgrading power supply systems in Bangladesh as part of a least-cost \nexpansion  plan,  the  strategy  consists  of  (i)  changes  in  the  business  environment  through \ncontinued corporatization and commercialization of sector entities as well as increasing private \nsector participation, (ii) institutional improvements in power sector entities, (iii) creation of new \npower sector companies to serve as role models for the sector, (iv) enlarging the scope of PBSs, \n(v) strengthening the long-term planning and regulatory processes, and (vi) promotion of good \ngovernance at the sector and corporate levels. The proposed program addresses items (i), (ii), \n(iii), (v), and (vi) of this strategy. Item (iv) has been addressed through ADB\u2019s earlier projects \nand World Bank\u2019s ongoing project for rural electrification. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED SECTOR DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n29.  The  proposed  Sustainable  Power  Sector  Development  Program  (the  Program)  is \nexpected to promote sustained economic growth in Bangladesh by providing improved capacity \nin the nation\u2019s power sector and reliable power supply to its people. The Program supports the \nGovernment\u2019s goal of providing reliable electricity to the entire country by 2020. Building on the \nsuccess of the first power sector development program, approved in 2003 (footnote 13), and \nconsistent with ADB\u2019s country strategy and program,16 the proposed program aims to provide \nfurther support and incentives to the Government for power sector reform through financially \nstabilizing sector entities and improving their governance while assisting to expand clean-fuel \npower  generation  capacity,  enhancing  transmission  network  reliability  and  efficiency,  and \nimproving quality of supply in Dhaka city and surrounding areas (the major power market). The \nProgram which is a high priority for the Government, is linked to the Government\u2019s sector reform \nroad map and is part of the least-cost development plan for the power sector.  \n \nB.  Important Features \n \n30.  Sustainable Sector Development. The Program, comprised of a program loan and \nproject loan, is designed to promote sustained development of the power sector in Bangladesh \nby pursuing (i) improved sector and corporate governance through further corporatization and \ncommercialization of the sector entities and other good governance measures; (ii) enhanced \nfinancial health of sector entities to be achieved by implementing a financial restructuring plan \nand reducing accounts receivable; (iii) improved operational efficiency of the sector entities by \nreducing overall system losses with investments in generation, transmission, and distribution \n                                                 \n16 ADB. 2005.

Manila. \n ", "11 \nsystems; (iv) promotion of private sector participation and public-private partnership; and (v) \nimplementation of a sector-wide capacity development program. \n \nC.  The Program Loan \n \n  1.  Outcome \n \n31.  The  policy  actions  supported  by  this  program  loan  will  be  improved  power  sector \nsustainability through financial and organizational restructuring and will focus on five key outputs \nthat will (i) develop and implement a national action plan for sector reforms, (ii) establish a fully \nfunctional legal and regulatory framework, (iii) enhance the financial health of power sector \nentities, (iv) further restructure the sector entities, and (v) promote private sector participation \nand public-private partnerships in the sector. Appendix 6 presents the development policy letter \nand policy matrix of the program loan along with strategic goals, key targets, and progress to \ndate for each output. \n \n  2.  Outputs \n \n32.  The policy matrix for the program loan consists of series of specific policy actions \ngrouped under the five outputs outlined above.  \n \n    a.  National Action Plan for Power Sector Reforms \n \n33.  By implementing various reform actions over the years, the Bangladesh power sector \nhas gained numerous institutional and operational improvements. The Government intends to \naccelerate the reform process by implementing a time-bound power sector reform action plan to \nhelp  achieve  sustained  economic  growth  and  poverty  reduction.  Towards  this  goal,  the \nproposed program will assist the Government to (i) develop and implement a time-bound sector \nreform action plan by preparing a detailed reform road map and engaging a regular monitoring \nsystem  for  the  reform  process,  (ii)  develop  a  long-term  power  system  master  plan  for \ntransmission and distribution as well as a strategy paper for a rural electrification program, and \n(iii) develop a sector-wide, medium-term capacity development program.  \n \n    b.  Fully Functioning Legal and Regulatory Framework  \n \n34.  Establishing a fully functioning legal and regulatory framework is crucial to successful \nreform, and the Government has taken the most fundamental step by establishing BERC in \n2004. BERC will need to address a number of complicated issues during the reform process to \nensure sustained sector growth. The proposed program seeks to assist the Government and \nBERC in this effort by setting out specific policy actions: (i) appointment of the remaining \ncommission member of BERC, (ii) approval of a BERC organogram by the relevant authorities \nof the Government to enable staff recruitment (footnote 3), and (iii) gazette notification of \nvarious rules and regulations to build a firm platform for BERC businesses.  \n \n    c.  Financial Health of Power Sector Entities \n \n35.  The financial position of the power sector entities has been enhanced in recent years, \nexcept for BPDB and DESA, owing to various reform processes supported by ADB and other \ndevelopment partners. PGCB and DESCO, in particular, became profitable organizations. To \nhelp improve the financial position of BPDB and DESA, a financial restructuring plan was \nprepared under ADB TA4379-BAN. It called for cleaning up their balance sheets by writing off \n ", "12 \nunrecoverable  cross-debts  between  sector  entities  and  converting  to  equity  unsustainable \noverdue debt service and long-term loans payable to the Government. The Government has \nrecently  drafted  a  time-bound  financial  restructuring  plan  for  these  entities.  The  proposed \nprogram supports this effort by specifying policy actions needed to facilitate approval of the \nfinancial restructuring plan by the relevant authorities by the Government.  \n \n36.  So far, BPDB and DESA have been meeting the liabilities for terminal benefits including \npension and gratuities of its employees from revenues, rather than on the basis of a funded trust \nor scheme. As a result, a significant part of the terminal benefit liabilities are unfunded. Although \na few new companies have recently emerged in the power sector, the corporatization process is \nbeing halted due to unfunded pension obligations and gratuities, which are estimated at about \n$163 million. It is inevitable that this issue must be addressed to accelerate the reform process.   \n \n37.  As a result of extensive policy dialogue between the Government and development \npartners, and especially owing to the support of ADB\u2019s PSDP, the accounts receivable of the \npower sector entities as of December 2005 have been reduced to a level of 3.8 times the \nmonthly average billing. However, the accounts receivable owed by the Government and its \nautonomous and semiautonomous bodies are still high. As of December 2005, the outstanding \ndues owed by the Government ministries and divisions were Tk1.4 billion, or 6.0 times the \nmonthly average billing to them, while the amount owed by the Government\u2019s autonomous and \nsemiautonomous bodies was Tk3.5 billion or 12.7 times the monthly average bills. There is a \nneed to further reduce the accounts receivable owed by the Government and its bodies.   \n \n    d.  Further Restructuring of Power Sector Entities  \n \n38.  ADB\u2019s PSDP (footnote 13) laid a foundation for further restructuring of the power sector \nby establishing several new entities under the Companies Act, such as Electricity Generation \nCompany of Bangladesh Limited (EGCB), DPDC, and North West Zone Power Distribution \nCompany  Limited  (NWZPDC).  The  program  loan  will  facilitate  downstream  activities  for \ncorporatizing these entities by helping constitute the board of directors, appoint management, \nand transfer operations to the new companies.    \n \n    e.  Promoting Private Sector Partnership and Public-Private Partnership \n \n39.  Since adoption of its policy in 1996 to promote private sector participation in power \ngeneration, the Government has succeeded in attracting foreign private capital. At present, the \nprivate sector supplies about 38% of the nation\u2019s total generation, which is the most successful \ncase  in  the  region.  As  discussed  above  (para.  19),  however,  Bangladesh  has  recently \nencountered difficulties in attracting private capital. While ADB provides TA to promote private \nsector participation and public-private partnerships in the sector, the program loan will address \nthe  issue  by  helping  the  Government  establish  an  enabling  environment  through  fully \noperationalizing the BERC, further corporatizing and commercializing the sector entities, and \nlisting  PGCB  and  DESCO  shares  in  the  local  stock  market.  This  will  instill  private  sector \nconfidence and encourage its gradual participation in the power sector. \n \n  3.  Financing Plan \n \n40.  The Government has requested a loan in various currencies equivalent to $60 million \nfrom ADB\u2019s Special Fund resources (Asian Development Fund) to help finance the Program. \nThe loan will have a term of 24 years, including a grace period of 8 years, and an interest rate of \n1% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter.  \n ", "13 \n \n \n  4.  Counterpart Funds \n \n41.  The counterpart funds to be generated from the proceeds of the program loan will be \nused to finance the adjustment costs associated with the Program, including funding unfunded \npension obligations and gratuities as well as to settle outstanding dues of the Government and \nits autonomous and semiautonomous bodies. The Government is expected to incur adjustment \ncosts over the reform period of about $183 million, which are detailed in Table 4.  \n \nTable 4: Financial Implications on Costs of Adjustment \n($ million) \n \nCost of Adjustments  FY2007  FY2008  FY2009  FY2010  Total \nFunding unfunded pension  25  25  50  63  163 \nobligations and gratuities \nSettling outstanding debts of the  10  10  0  0  20 \nGovernment and its agencies \nTotal  35  35  50  63  183 \nSource of Funds           \nGovernment  5  5  50  63  123 \nAsian Development Bank  30  30  0  0  60 \nTotal  35  35  50  63  183 \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n  5.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n    a.  Program Management \n \n42.  For the program loan, the Borrower will be the People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh. The \nexecuting agencies (EAs) will be the Finance Division of the Ministry of Finance (MOF) and the \nPower Division of the Ministry of Power, Energy and Mineral Resources (MPEMR), which will be \nresponsible for the overall coordination of the program loan during the implementation period.  \n \n    b.  Period of Implementation \n \n43.  The reform supported under the program loan is to be completed by June 2008.  \n \n    c.  Procurement and Disbursement  \n \n44.  The proceeds of the policy loan will be used to finance the costs (excluding local taxes \nand  duties)  of  items  produced  in  and  procured  from  ADB\u2019s  member  countries,  preferably \nprocured for the power sector, other than those specified in the negative list in Appendix 7 and \nimports financed by other bilateral and multilateral sources.  \n \n45.  In accordance with the provisions of ADB\u2019s Simplification of Disbursement Procedures \nand  Related  Requirements  for  Program  Loans,  the  proceeds  of  the  program  loan  will  be \ndisbursed  to  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  Bangladesh  as  the  Borrower.  No  supporting  import \ndocumentation will be required. Loan proceeds will be disbursed on the basis of certification \nprovided by the Borrower confirming that in each year which policy loan proceeds are expected \nto be disbursed the value of total imports minus (i) imports from nonmember countries, (ii) \n ", "14 \nineligible imports, and (iii) imports financed under other official development assistance are \nequal  to  or  greater  than  the  amount  expected  to  be  disbursed  during  such  year.  The \nGovernment will certify that each withdrawal request complies with this formula. Otherwise, \nimport documentation under existing procedures will be required.  \n \n    d.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting  \n \n46.  ADB retains the right to audit the use of loan proceeds and to verify the accuracy of the \nGovernment\u2019s certification for each withdrawal application. Prior to withdrawal, the Government \nwill open a deposit account at Bangladesh Bank into which the proceeds of the loans will be \ndeposited  and  from  which  all  withdrawals  will  be  made.  The  accounts  will  be  managed, \noperated, and liquidated in accordance with terms satisfactory to ADB. MPEMR, in collaboration \nwith MOF, will send quarterly progress reports to ADB.  \n \n    e.  Tranching \n \n47.  The loan will be released in two tranches, each of $30 million equivalent, and these will \nbe made available upon fulfillment of the actions enumerated in Table 5. \n \nTable 5: Required Actions for Tranche Release \n \nOutput  First Tranche ($30 million)  Second Tranche ($30 million) \n1.

The Project Loan \n \n  1.  Outcome \n \n48.  The outcome of the project loan is expanded capacity for clean-fuel power generation \nand improved efficiency in transmission and distribution systems to be achieved by (i) increased \npeak load generation capacity using clean natural gas, and (ii) augmented and expanded \ntransmission and distribution systems to improve network efficiency and reliability. This support \nwill also further accelerate the sector\u2019s restructuring by transferring the entire DESA distribution \nsystems to DPDC and creating a new generation company in the country\u2019s northwest. \n \n  2.  Outputs \n \n49.  The outputs of the project comprise four investment components and one capacity \ndevelopment component as summarized below. The specific activities and rationale for the \ninvestment components are provided in Supplementary Appendix B. \n \n(i)  Part  A:  Clean  energy  capacity  expansion.

The Government has requested ADB to provide two loans under the project loan, one of \n$400 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources to help finance procurement and consulting \nservices for parts A, B, C, and D, and one of $5 million equivalent from its Special Funds \nresources (Asian Development Fund) for part E. The Government will meet the balance of the \ncost through loans, grants, and equity contributions to the EAs or the EA\u2019s internal resources \nincluding all taxes and duties.  \n \n52.  The  ordinary  capital  resources  loan  will  be  provided  to  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of \nBangladesh with a 25-year term, including a 5-year grace period, an interest rate determined in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility,  a \ncommitment charge of 0.75% per annum, a front-end fee17 of 1.0% (to be capitalized in the \nloan), and such other terms and conditions as set forth in the loan and program agreements. \nThe Government has provided ADB with (i) the reasons for its decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s \nLIBOR-based lending facility based on these terms and conditions, and (ii) an undertaking that \nthese  choices  were  its  own  independent  decision  and  not  made  in  reliance  on  any \ncommunication or advice from ADB. The loan proceeds will be relent to BPDB (and later \ntransferred to its successor company) for part A, PGCB for part B, DPDC for part C, and \nDESCO for part D pursuant to subsidiary loan agreements with terms and conditions acceptable \nto ADB. Relending terms to these entities will include a repayment period of 20 years including \na 5-year grace period, and interest of 5.5% per annum. Foreign exchange risk will be assumed \nby the corresponding entities during the life of the respective subsidiary loan and thereafter by \nthe Borrower.  \n \n53.  The Special Funds resources loan will have a term of 32 years, including a grace period \nof 8 years and an interest charge of 1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per \nannum thereafter. The Borrower will be the People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh, and the proceeds \nwill be provided to MPEMR.

Further financing from commercial sources during the project implementation period will \nbe encouraged for additional investments into the power sector to complement ADB financing. \n                                                 \n17 The front-end fee will be waived if the loan is approved before June 2008 and the borrower has no arrears.  \n ", "18 \nSuch  cofinancing  may  benefit  from  ADB  credit  enhancements,  including  ADB  guarantee \ninstruments, and will be presented separately for consideration by ADB\u2019s Board of Directors as \nand when it arises. KfW has expressed its interest in cofinancing part C. Once the cofinancing is \ncommitted, ADB loan will be reduced accordingly.  \n \n  5.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n    a.  Project Management \n \n55.  The EA for part A will be BPDB and its successor company, tentatively called Northwest \nPower Generation Company Limited (NWPGC).18 PGCB, DPDC, and DESCO will be the EAs \nfor parts B, C, and D, respectively. The Power Division of MPEMR will execute part E. Until \nsuch time as NWPGC and DPDC can take over project implementation, BPDB and DESA will \nassist and carry out all necessary steps and actions to prepare for and facilitate implementation \nof their respective components. The EAs and Power Division of MPEMR will be responsible for \nsupervising project implementation and monitoring of project operational performance. \n \n    b.  Implementation Period \n \n56.  The  project  will  be  implemented  over  a  42-month  period.  Implementation  has \ncommenced  in  July  2006  with  preparation  of  requests  for  proposals  for  recruitment  of \nimplementation consultants and draft bidding documents by the EAs, and it will be completed by \nDecember 2009. The implementation schedule of the project loan is presented in Appendix 9. \n \n    c.  Procurement \n \n57.  Procurement of goods and services to be financed under the investment components \nwill be carried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from \ntime to time). For such procurement, bid specifications will be prepared in a manner to ensure \nmaximum  competition  under  international  competitive  bidding.  A  third-party  pre-shipment \ninspection provision will be adopted to ensure quality of goods and equipments. In order to \nencourage local industry, contracts estimated to cost less than $500,000 for equipment and \nrelated  services,  and  less  than  $1,000,000  for  works,  may  be  procured  following  national \ncompetitive bidding (NCB) procedures while allowing foreign firms also to participate. Before \ncommencement  of  NCB  procurement,  ADB  and  the  Borrower  will  review  the  Borrower\u2019s \nprocurement  procedures  to  ensure  consistency  with  ADB  requirements.  Any  necessary \nmodifications  or  clarifications  to  the  Borrower\u2019s  procedures  will  be  documented  in  the \nprocurement plan. ADB\u2019s domestic preference scheme may be utilized. A detailed procurement \nplan is in Appendix 10.  \n \nd.  Consulting Services \n \n58.  International and national consultants will assist BPDB and its successor generation \ncompany (NWPGC) for part A and PGCB for part B in preparing bidding documents, including \nbasic design, evaluating bids, and project implementation supervision that includes approval of \nfinal design, as well as the Power Division of MPEMR in capacity development.19 All of these \n                                                 \n18 Before loan effectiveness, the Government will establish this new company under the Companies Act 1994, as \namended. \n19 While there are some consulting services budgeted for parts C and D, these will be funded by the EAs and are not \ndirectly connected to the components funded by ADB.  \n ", "19 \nconsultants will be recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \n(2007, as amended from time to time). For parts A and B, the simplified technical proposals and \nquality- and cost-based selection method will be used. For Part E, the quality- and cost-based \nselection method and the simplified technical proposals or biodata technical proposals will be \nused.  \n \n59.  Consulting  services  required  for  part  A  are  estimated  at  34  person-months  of \ninternational  and  72  person-months  of  national  consultants  with  expertise  in  design, \nconstruction,  testing,  and  commissioning  of  gas-fired  power  generating  plants.  Consulting \nservices for part B are estimated at 38 person-months of international and 60 person-months of \nnational consultants with expertise in design, construction, testing, and commissioning of 400-\nkV transmission line and gas-insulated switchyard substations. Consulting services for part E \nare  estimated  at  150  person-months  of  international  and  200  person-months  of  national \nconsultants  with  expertise  in  various  areas  including  corporate  and  financial management, \ninformation and communication technology, long-term system planning, governance, research \nand development, and human resource development. The outline terms of reference for the \nconsulting services are provided in Supplementary Appendix E.  \n \n    e.  Good Governance  \n \n60.  The  Program  is  designed  to  improve  sector-level  good  governance  by  improving \npredictability (long-term planning, codification of rules and regulations, and independence of \nregulatory processes), transparency (systematic dissemination of relevant sector information \nand discussions on issues before decisions are made), and accountability (establishing the \ncause-effect structure of incentives). It is expected that the governance at the sector level will be \nimproved when the sector is fully reorganized as corporate entities and BERC is fully functional, \nas this will ensure predictability, transparency, and accountability in the business process. At the \ncorporate level, governance will be enhanced by the continued introduction of a new corporate \nculture  through  corporatization;  independence  of  each  entity\u2019s  board  of  directors  from  the \nGovernment; introduction of market-oriented incentive packages for staff of corporatized entities; \ndefined  delegation  of  powers  to  staff;  expansion  of  computerized  billing,  accounting  and \nmanagement information systems; use of prepaid meters; and commercialization of activities. \nFurthermore, the Government has implemented an operational risk mitigation action plan, which \nwas jointly prepared jointly by the World Bank, ADB, and other development partners to address \nkey governance risks and weaknesses. Moreover, since 1 January 2007, the Government and \nADB are undertaking a joint operational risk assessment in coordination with other development \npartners in such high risk sectors as the power sector. Table 8 lists the specific governance risk \nmitigation measures that have been taken into consideration in designing the Program.  \n \nTable 8: Governance Risk Mitigation Measures \n \nArea  Measures \n  (cid:131)  Use of Asian Development Bank (ADB) guidelines on procurement and \n  consulting services. \n  (cid:131)  Use of ADB\u2019s standard bidding documents and standard request for proposal \n  documents for procurement and recruitment of consultants. \n  (cid:131)  Bid specifications and packaging to be prepared to ensure maximum \nProcurement  competition under international competitive bidding procedures. \n(cid:131)  A third-party pre-shipment inspection provision to be adopted to ensure quality \nof goods and equipment.  \n(cid:131)  Capacity development of sector entities on e-procurement to increase \ntransparency, accountability, and efficiency in procurement. \n(cid:131)  Expansion of performance-based contracting for outsourced tasks. \n ", "20 \n \nArea  Measures \n  (cid:131)  Regular access to the Executing Agency\u2019s accounting and control systems to \n  monitor expenditures and other financial transactions and safe custody of \n  project-financed assets.  \n  (cid:131)  Capacity development of the sector entities in accounting and internal control \n  systems, financial management, and audit capabilities. \n  (cid:131)  Expanded use of advanced information and communication technology based \nFinancial Management  financial management systems to ensure efficient and accountable financial \nand Audit  management systems. \n(cid:131)  Financial statements to be audited by external auditors acceptable to ADB and \nregularly published and reported to the shareholders. \n(cid:131)  Measurable financial performance indicators for each company to be \nestablished, evaluated, and benchmarked. \n(cid:131)  Introduction of an appropriate internal audit system through the capacity \nbuilding program.  \n(cid:131)  Implementation of an operational risk mitigation action plan and undertaking a \njoint operational risk assessment with development partners. \n \n  (cid:131)  Public disclosure of operational and financial performance of the sector \n  entities to improve transparency: www.powercell.gov.bd. \n  (cid:131)  Establishment of a fully functional sector regulator to ensure a level playing \n  field among sector entities and to improve sector governance.  \nInstitutional   (cid:131)  Continued introduction of a new corporate culture through further \nMechanisms  corporatization and commercialization, independence of the board of directors \nfrom the Government, and defined delegation of powers to staff. \n(cid:131)  Promotion of private sector participation and public-private partnership. \n(cid:131)  Expansion of computerized billing system and prepaid meters.  \n(cid:131)  Enforcement of Electricity (Amendment) Act, 2006 to help prevent corruption \nin the power sector business. \nSources: The Government of Bangladesh and Asian Development Bank. \n \n61.  ADB\u2019s  policy  on  Anticorruption  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was  explained  to  and \ndiscussed with the Government and EAs. Consistent with its commitment to good governance, \naccountability, and transparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its \nagents, any allegedly corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the Program. \nTo support these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s policy on Anticorruption are included in \nthe loan regulations and bidding documents. In particular, all contracts financed by ADB in \nconnection with the investment components shall include provisions specifying the right of ADB \nto audit and examine the records and accounts of the EAs and all contractors, suppliers, \nconsultants, and other service providers as they relate to the Program. \n \n    f.  Advance Procurement \n \n62.  All the EAs have sufficient experience in procuring materials for the works entrusted to \nthem under previous investment loans and were allowed to initiate advance action in July 2006. \nAll the EAs have commenced advance action by preparing draft requests for proposals for \nrecruiting  implementation  consultants  and  draft  bidding  documents  for  procurement.  The \nGovernment has been advised that ADB\u2019s approval of advance action on procurement and \nrecruitment of consultants does not commit ADB to subsequently approve the project or to \nfinance the recruitment and procurement costs. Retroactive financing is not permitted. \n ", "21 \n    g.  Disbursement Arrangements \n \n63.  Disbursement procedures will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s disbursement handbook,20 \nas amended from time to time, and detailed arrangements agreed upon by the Government and \nADB. Since the disbursements under both project loans will be mainly for procuring goods and \nservices, ADB\u2019s commitment letter and direct payment procedures will be utilized.  \n \n    h.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n \n64.  The accounting, auditing, and reporting systems and procedures for the project loans will \nbe established in accordance with accounting principles and practices satisfactory to ADB. The \nEAs will maintain separate accounts for the project components. Independent auditors whose \nqualifications, experience, and terms of reference are acceptable to ADB will audit the project \naccounts and related financial statements annually. Certified copies in English of such audited \naccounts and financial statements of each EA will be submitted to ADB not later than 6 months \nafter the end of the financial year to which they relate. All EAs were informed about ADB\u2019s policy \non submitting audited financial statements and possible penalties for delayed submission.  \n \n    i.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n \n65.  Each EA will prepare separate progress reports for its respective component and submit \nthese to ADB on a quarterly basis within 20 days from the end of each quarter. Each report will \nprovide  a  narrative  description  of  progress  made  during  the  period,  changes  in  the \nimplementation schedule, problems or difficulties encountered, the performance of the project \nimplementation consultants, and the work to be carried out in the next period. A progress report \nwill also include a summary financial account for the project loan components, consisting of \nproject expenditures for the year to date and total expenditure to date. Performance will be \nevaluated based on indicators and targets stipulated in the design and monitoring framework.  \n \n    j.  Project Review \n \n66.  ADB will field an inception mission within 3 months of the Program approval. ADB will \nreview  the  implementation  and operation  of  the  Program  based on the  quarterly  progress \nreports and meet with the EAs and the Government semiannually to discuss implementation \nprogress. A midterm review will be carried out 2 years after the loan effectiveness, focusing on \nthe engineering, resettlement, and environmental aspects of the ADB supported investments \nand reviewing the financial status of the EAs. A project completion report will be submitted to \nADB within 3 months following completion of the individual parts of the investment loan.  \n \nIV.  PROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \nA.  Expected Benefits \n \n  1.  Program Loan \n \n67.  The program loan will help improve sustainability of the power sector by implementing \nnational  action  plans  for  power  sector  reforms;  financially  stabilizing  BPDB  and  DESA; \nstrengthening  the  policy,  legal,  and  regulatory  framework;  and  promoting  private  sector \nparticipation. The power sector is expected to contribute positively to Bangladesh\u2019s economic \n                                                 \n20 ADB. 2001. Loan Disbursement Handbook. Manila. \n ", "22 \ndevelopment through enhanced capacity and quality of power supply. A major portion of the \nProgram is also geared towards establishing the financial soundness of BPDB\u2019s and DESA\u2019s \nsuccessor companies so that they can commence operations on a sound financial base. As the \nprogram loan component is mainly related to financial and organizational restructuring of power \nsector entities, it has not been considered in the economic or financial analysis. \n \n  2.  Project Loan  \n \n    a.  Economic Analysis  \n \n68.  The economic internal rates of return (EIRRs) were calculated for each part of the \nproject loan. These range from 14.4% to 42.4% and compare favorably with the opportunity cost \nof capital of 12% per annum. The combined EIRR for all the project components was estimated \nat 28.9%. The EIRRs were also subjected to a sensitivity analysis of key variables. The key \nvariables tested were (i) a 10% increase in capital costs, (ii) a fuel price rise of 10%, (iii) a 10% \nincrease  in  operation  and  maintenance  costs,  (iv)  a  benefits  decrease  of  10%,  and  (v)  a \ncombination of all variables. Sensitivity analysis indicates that the EIRRs for each part of the \nproject loan and the project overall are robust under most conditions. The detailed economic \nevaluation and sensitivity analysis are given in Supplementary Appendix F. \n \n    b.  Financial Management \n \n69.  Using financial management assessment questionnaires and field interview, financial \nmanagement assessments were undertaken for each EA to evaluate its ability to undertake and \nfulfill ADB\u2019s fiduciary requirements for the project components. The EAs\u2019 financial management \nwas found to be acceptable. Project implementation delays are expected to be minimized since \nthese entities are already exposed to and familiar with ADB procedures and requirements.  \n \n    c.  Financial Sustainability  \n \n70.  Financial projections were prepared for each EA under the assumption that the new \nentities  will  take  over  operation  of  BPDB  in  part  and  of  DESA  in  its  entirety  during  the \nconstruction phase. Financial projections, including projected operating and financial ratios, \nhave been prepared in nominal terms. Estimates of operation and maintenance costs consider \nimprovements in efficiency from optimally sized systems compared with the existing system. \nFinancial projections also assume better cash flow management, including improved collection \nratios to be achieved under the Program. From FY2009, all EAs are expected to meet cash flow \nas well as operating requirements, meet full debt service obligations, and maintain a minimum \n1.2 debt service ratio. Detailed financial performance and projections for the EAs are provided in \nSupplementary Appendix G. \n \n71.  Financial evaluation was completed for parts A through D of the project loan in real \nterms  using  constant  2006  prices.  The  project  cost  estimates  and  financial  projections  in \nnominal terms were converted to real terms by adjusting for the projected effects of foreign and \ndomestic inflation and currency fluctuation. Incremental costs and benefits were derived by \nevaluating the financial position of the EAs under with- and without-project scenarios. The \naverage financial internal rate of return (FIRR), computed on an after-tax basis, ranges from \n6.1%  to  12.4%.  This  compares  favorably  with  the  weighted  average  cost  of  capital,  also \ncomputed on an after-tax basis, of 2.9% on an aggregate basis. All parts of the project loan are \nconsidered both financially viable and sustainable. Sensitivity and risk analysis indicates that the \n ", "23 \nFIRR for each subproject and the project overall are robust under most conditions. Detailed \nfinancial analysis is provided in Supplementary Appendix H.  \n \n    d.  Social Assessment  \n   \n      (i)  Social and Poverty Issues \n \n72.  As the Program seeks to improve efficiencies in power sector operations and lower \nelectricity supply costs, all electricity consumers will benefit from it. The combined interventions \nof the proposed program loan and project loan are strongly interlinked and will result in various \nindirect social benefits. Improved financial management from corporatizing and commercializing \nsector  entities,  along  with  independent  tariff  rulings,  will  benefit  all  consumer  categories. \nCommercialization  will  improve  corporate  governance,  decrease  corruption,  reduce  system \nlosses, and allow the Government to realize savings that can be directed to social sectors. \n \n73.  The Program will bring about numerous benefits in the project areas. These include that \n(i) all consumers will be supplied power reliably and with improved quality, (ii) commercial and \nindustrial operations will run more smoothly owing to reduced load shedding, (iii) low voltage \nproblems will diminish, (iv) replacing old lines with insulated ones will improve public safety. \nElectricity will be supplied to any group that requests new connection or increased supply. New \nconsumers to be connected under the Program are estimated to be about 230,000 in Dhaka \narea comprising domestic, commercial, irrigation, industrial and other consumer categories, and \nthe incremental power supplies from the Program will be sufficient to serve at least 6 million \nconsumers at current per capita generation rates. The Program will also directly benefit 820,000 \nexisting consumers in Dhaka area by providing improved quality of power supply. \n \n74.  The improvement in the power distribution system will benefit all, including the poor, \nwomen, and children. A reliable and improved quality power supply will increase employment \nopportunities and incomes. Many businesses in the country have been affected by frequent \npower  outages,  including  garment  factories,  which  employ  several  million  poor  people, \nparticularly poor women. A stable power supply will increase stability in manufacturing and \nservices processes and boost enterprises\u2019 productivity. A large part of the available labor in \nurban areas like Dhaka are poor migrant workers from rural areas; the increased employment \nopportunities for these laborers will add to the remittances they make to their homes, helping to \nreduce poverty in the rural areas and increase their welfare.  \n \n75.  The poor, and especially women, are disproportionately affected by power losses and \nunstable  power  supply  leading  to  low  income  and  long  working  hours.  Health  clinics  and \ndiagnostic services are also seriously disrupted, as many units become nonoperational due to \nlow voltage or have shortened service lives because of constant power outages. Water supply \nand streetlights are of poor quality due to power disruption. Better power supply provided by the \nProgram is expected to improve facilities and services. The Program will reduce waiting times \ndue to power outages, equipment loss through low voltage, and the constant potential for \nimpairment of emergency services through load shedding. An indirect, but significant positive \ndevelopment impact is envisaged through availability of light for education, improved water \nsupply, diagnostic and health services etc. Children and students will benefit from longer study \nhours, information technology-based learning, and communications opportunities. The summary \npoverty reduction and social strategy for the Program is presented in Appendix 11. \n \n \n \n ", "24 \n      (ii)  Involuntary Resettlement and Indigenous Peoples \n \n76.  All project components have been sited and designed to minimize land acquisition and \nresettlement impacts. Part A of the project loan will have no resettlement impact because the \nsites have already been developed by the EA, including associated auxiliaries, switchyards, and \nconnections to the national transmission grid. Part B will have some resettlement impacts \nrelated to right-of-way clearance and land acquisition for new substations. Parts C and D will \nhave  minor  impacts  related  to  land  acquisition  for  new  substations,  expansion  of  existing \nsubstations, and new 33 kV lines in the Dhaka area. The impacts of parts C and D will be \nminimized to the extent possible by installing power cables underground beneath medians of \nexisting roads. Substations under parts C and D will be built on government land wherever \npossible.  Attached  plots  are  walled  or  fenced,  and  therefore  no  risk  of  encroachments  is \nanticipated.  A  summary  resettlement  plan  (RP)  is  given  in  Appendix  12,  while  the  full \nresettlement plan is provided in Supplementary Appendix I. \n \n77.  No impact is foreseen on indigenous peoples, although special provisions have been \nmade in the RP to ensure they are not discriminated against, particularly in land compensation. \nIndigenous groups in Bangladesh are not usually subject to discrimination based on ethnicity, \nreligion,  or  other  grounds.  Vulnerability  relates  to  groups  other  than  indigenous  peoples, \nparticularly those living in extreme poverty and women. The RP has provisions for these groups.  \n \n    e.  Environmental Analysis \n \n78.  All parts of the project loan are assigned to category B under ADB\u2019s Environmental \nGuidelines. Rapid environmental assessments were conducted for all proposed components. \nField  visits  and  initial  environmental  examinations  (IEEs),  including  an  environmental \nmanagement plan, were conducted. A summary IEE for the overall Program is in Appendix 13. \nEnvironmental  and  social  benefits  will  occur  due  to  use  of  clean  natural  gas  for  power \ngeneration (replacing diesel generating sets, traditional wood fuel, and agricultural biomass \nenergy),  improved  power  system  efficiency  via  peak-shaving  and  new  transmission  and \ndistribution  capacity,  and  reduced  aggregate  technical  and  commercial  losses  via  system \nupgrades. Environmental benefits include improved air quality, reduced regional pollutant loads, \nand offsetting growth in greenhouse gas emissions. Negative environmental impacts have been \nminimized through careful project design and can be mitigated cost-effectively. Overall project \nbenefits outweigh negative impacts. \n \nB.  Risks and Safeguards \n \n79.  Political Commitment. The Program\u2019s success depends on the Government\u2019s strong \ncommitment to power sector reforms in general and, more specifically, to successfully creating a \nnew power generation company to implement part A and transferring operational authority for \nDESA area to DPDC to implement part C. There is risk these actions may be affected by future \npolitical developments. However, this risk is considered low and may be mitigated by continued \npolicy dialogue, as the Government has shown consistent commitment to power sector reforms \nsince adopting the PSRB in 1994. Moreover, the sector has comprehensive experience from \nprevious  projects  in  setting  up  new  companies  and  transferring  operational  authority.  The \nsuccess of the sector's corporatized entities clearly indicates the direction of reform, which is \nwidely recognized by various stakeholders. \n \n80.  Regulatory Capacity. The Bangladesh Energy Regulatory Commission Act, 2003 was \npassed by Parliament to give the regulatory body a wider mandate and independence. Since \n ", "25 \nthis Act provides the legal framework for an independent BERC to operate, it is now the \nGovernment\u2019s responsibility to ensure that regulatory actions are taken based on commercial \nprinciples  and  without  outside  interference.  Given  its  central  role  in  various  sector  reform \nactivities, BERC should be able to undertake its mandate with adequate human resources and \nan operating budget. The proposed program will facilitate the Government\u2019s action in making \nBERC fully operational. The Program also complements USAID activities in preparing detailed \nrules and regulations for licensing and tariff settings based on commercial principles.  \n \n81.  Good  Governance.  Good  governance  is  an  essential  precondition  for  sustainable \npower sector development in Bangladesh. The Government has placed good governance at the \ncenter of power sector reform policies. The Program design includes specific measures to \nreduce risk of corruption and improve governance (paras. 60\u201361). \n \n82.  Project Readiness. Previous ADB-financed projects in the power sector in Bangladesh \nhave  experienced  frequent  delays  in  project  implementation,  largely  due  to  poor  front-end \nproject preparation by the EAs, particularly in obtaining government approvals for projects\u2019 \ncomponents  proposals,  slow  progress  in  land  acquisition,  and  cumbersome  procurement \nprocedures, coupled with delays in formulating project teams. The EAs and Government have \nundertaken  various  actions  to  accelerate  project  implementation.  The  EAs  already  have \nappointed all the project teams including project directors; the development project proposals for \nall the investment components have been approved by the Government. Land acquisition for \nconstruction of the project components has also been completed or is in an advanced stage. As \nall  the  project  components  will  be  implemented  by  corporatized  entities,  an  accelerated \nprocurement process is anticipated since the decisions can be made by the respective boards \nof directors without referring them to the Government. Moreover, a number of draft bidding \ndocuments for procuring goods and services and draft requests for proposals for recruiting \nimplementation consultants have already been submitted to ADB by the EAs, and several \nbidding documents have been issued to accelerate the front-end activities. Supplementary \nAppendix J presents the status on the project readiness.  \n \nV.  ASSURANCES \n \n83.  In  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents. \n \nA.  Specific Assurances \n  1.

Institutional Framework and Reform Overview \n1.  The power sector in Bangladesh began operations immediately after independence in \n1972 with creation of the Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB), upon restructuring of \nEast Pakistan Water and Power Development Authority, as the sole utility responsible for all \ngeneration, transmission, and distribution. In 1977, the Rural Electrification Board (REB) was \ncreated to undertake electrification in rural Bangladesh. Since its creation, BPDB\u2019s commercial \nperformance has been weak. In 1991, to address this situation, the Government split up BPDB\u2019s \noperations and created a new distribution entity, the Dhaka Electric Supply Authority (DESA). \nDESA was given responsibility for power distribution in the Greater Dhaka area. However, as all \nof DESA\u2019s assets and personnel were transferred over from BPDB without any changes in \nbusiness culture, the power sector faced continuing commercial failure. Recognizing the need to \nimprove the sector\u2019s performance the Government, in consultation with the major development \npartners,1 adopted a policy paper in 1994 entitled Power Sector Reforms in Bangladesh (PSRB). \nThe PSRB outlined the reform process to gradually remove constraints in the sector through (i) \nseparating sector regulation and operation; (ii) creating autonomy and commercial orientation \namong the sector entities; (iii) unbundling generation, transmission, and distribution; and (iv) \nincreasing private sector participation. Subsequently, in 2000, the Government issued its Vision \nand Policy Statement for Power Sector Reforms that further clarified specific details of the \nstructural changes in generation, transmission, and distribution along with the principles of \ncorporatization and commercialization. In 2006, the Government issued a 3-year road map for \npower  sector  reforms  to  undertake  further  organizational  restructuring  toward  improving \ncorporate governance and promoting commercialization.  \n \n2.  As a result of implementing the reform policy, several new public sector entities have \nbeen established and made operational. These include the Power Grid Company of Bangladesh \nLimited (PGCB), the Dhaka Electric Supply Company Limited (DESCO), the West Zone Power \nDistribution Company Limited (WZPDC), the Ashuganj Power Station Company Limited (APSC), \nand the Electricity Generation Company of Bangladesh Limited (EGCB). In addition, private \nsector independent power producers (IPPs), including the Rural Power Company Limited (RPC), \nhave been established and started operation. PGCB has taken over all BPDB\u2019s transmission \nassets and most of DESA\u2019s transmission assets. DESCO has secured DESA\u2019s distribution \nassets in the Mirpur and Gulshan Circles of Dhaka. WZPDC and APSC have taken over \nBPDB\u2019s distribution assets in the west and generation assets in the Ashuganj Power Station, \nrespectively. Moreover, 70 rural electric cooperatives (PBSs)\u2014organized, initially funded, and \nmonitored by REB\u2014are in charge of power distribution in most rural areas. DESA\u2019s area outside \nDhaka city was transferred to eight PBSs. In 2005, the Dhaka Power Distribution Company \nLimited  (DPDC)  and  North  West  Zone  Power  Distribution  Company  Limited  (NWZPDC), \nrespectively,  were  established to  take  over  the  distribution  assets  of  DESA\u2019s  and  BPDB\u2019s \nnorthwest zone power distribution network, respectively. The Bangladesh Energy Regulatory \nCommission (BERC) was established in April 2004 as an independent regulatory body under \nthe  Bangladesh  Energy  Regulatory  Commission  Act,  2003  to  regulate  energy  businesses \nincluding the power sector. The Government, through the Power Division of the Ministry of \nPower, Energy and Mineral Resources (MPEMR), wholly owns and supervises BPDB, DESA, \nand REB.

Generation Potential and Expansion Plans  \n \n3.  While abundant water flows in the Jamuna-Padma-Meghna river system, hydropower \npotential is limited because of the flat terrain. Coal reserves, which are located in the northwest, \nare deep beneath the surface and difficult to develop. One potential mine with a limited output of \nabout 1 million tons per annum is being developed with external assistance to feed 2x125 \nmegawatt  (MW)  power  plants,  and  a  study  is  being  undertaken  to  review  feasibility  for \ndevelopment of another coalmine in the northwest. The country's entire proven recoverable \nreserves of oil (including condensate) are estimated at 59 million barrels. Although Bangladesh \nhas  had  some  successes  in  small-scale  development  of  renewable  resources,  these  are \nperipheral to the issue of generating bulk electricity for the main grid. Bangladesh is, however, \nwell endowed with natural gas. In fact, natural gas is the only significant source of commercial \nenergy in Bangladesh. At present, about 85% of the power generation capacity in the country is \ngas based, 10% is based on imported fuel, and 5% is hydro. In terms of energy generated, \n ", "38  Appendix 2 \nabout 90% of the total in fiscal year (FY) 2005 is from gas-fired power plants. Present gas \nreserves and production are considered adequate to serve the existing power plants, and it is \nhighly probable that additional reserves could be developed to serve the needs of those power \nplants projected until 2025.  \n \n4.  Over the last 10 years, consumption of electricity in Bangladesh grew at an average \ncompound annual rate of 8.1%, and it is expected that demand for electricity will grow at an \nannual rate of about 8.0% for the next 10 years. The ADB funded power system master plan \nupdate projected that a total capacity expansion of 17,900 MW would be necessary through \n2025, of which 3,500 MW would be needed by 2010.2 Figure A2.2 shows the projected annual \nand cumulative capacity additions from 2005 through 2025. \n \n  Figure A2.2: Planned Generation Capacity Additions through 2025 \n       \n  25,000\n  Existing and committed\n  150 MW Simple Cycle Gas Turbine\n20,000\n        W\n  M 450 MW Combined Cycle\n  city,  15,000 700 MW Combined Cycle\n  pa Peak Load\n  Ca\n  ed  10,000\n  all\nst\n  n\nI 5,000\n \n \n  0\n \n  2005 2007 2009 2011 2013 2015 2017 2019 2021 2023 2025\n   \n  MW = megawatts \n  Source:Powersectorentities.\n \nC.  Transmission System Expansion \n5.  The transmission system within Bangladesh is the responsibility of PGCB, which was \nestablished by separating BPDB\u2019s transmission assets and commenced operations in 1996. \nThe highest voltage level of PGCB\u2019s transmission system is 230 kilovolt (kV), with transmission \nlines structured as a 230 kV loop around Dhaka with radial extension to the western part of \nBangladesh and the southern region in the Chittagong area. The 132 kV system extends \nradially from Dhaka to the central and southern regions. Similarly, the northern and western \nregions in the western part of the country are interconnected through 132 kV lines. Currently, \nPGCB owns 1,436 circuit-km of 230 kV transmission lines and 4,868 circuit-km of 132 kV \ntransmission lines, with transmission capacity of 3,925 megavolt-amperes (MVA).  \n \n6.  The  power  system  master  plan  update\u2019s  least-cost  expansion  plan  concluded  that \nadditional transmission capacity of 4,875 MVA of 230/132 kV transformers will be required by \n2010 and another 4,650 MVA by 2015, along with corresponding transmission lines. While \nPGCB  has  undertaken  to  mobilize  investment  capital  through  various  measures,  including \nissuing  corporate  bonds  and  off-loading  its  stock,  as  approved  by  the  Government,  the \nproposed investment support from the Asian Development Bank will be critical to this goal.  \n                                                 \n2  ADB. 2004.

Power distribution systems need to be expanded in tandem with the generation and \ntransmission capacity expansions to enable delivery of power to end consumers. At present, \nseveral entities are involved in the power distribution business in Bangladesh. DESA3 and \nDESCO are covering Dhaka areas, while PBSs cover most rural areas and BPDB primarily \ncovers  urban  areas  outside  Dhaka.  WZPDC  and  NWZPDC,  respectively,  are  taking  over \nBPDB\u2019s distribution networks in the western and northwestern parts of the country.  \n \nE.  Share and Performance of Power Sector Entities  \n \n8.  While BPDB in FY2000 produced more than 90% of the total net generation, in FY2005 \nit accounted for 47.8%. Over the same period, the share of IPPs (including RPC) in total net \ngeneration increased from 8.4% to 38.2%. As for distribution, REB represents the largest share \nof distribution with 34.3% in FY2005, followed by BPDB with 29.5%, DESA with 25.2%, and \nDESCO with 9.1%. PGCB is wholly responsible for transmission.

Introduction \n \n1.  The Bangladesh power sector has experienced numerous institutional and operational \nimprovements during the past several years, but huge disparities remain between the various \nsector entities as measured by their financial performances. While the two key sector entities, \nthe  Power  Grid  Company  of  Bangladesh  Limited  (PGCB)  and  the  Dhaka  Electric  Supply \nCompany Limited (DESCO) outperformed other entities, the Bangladesh Power Development \nBoard (BPDB) and Dhaka Electric Supply Authority (DESA) continue to make financial losses. \nThis tariff analysis1 intends to (i) explore the reasons behind these financial and operational \nperformance disparities, (ii) identify core weaknesses at the sector and corporate levels, (iii) \nassess various scenarios, and (iv) recommend a feasible solution to address the issues.  \nB.  Analysis \n \n2.  The current tariff system includes (i) wholesale tariffs, (ii) transmission wheeling charges, \nand (iii) retail distribution tariffs charged to end-use consumers.  \n \n  1.   Wholesale Tariff \n \n3.  Independent power producer tariffs are set in long-term power purchase agreements \nspecifying both capacity and energy payments, and these are related to an expected plant load \nfactor for each power station. Plant load factors range from 59% for the Rural Power Company \nLimited plant at Mymensingh to 81% at the AES Haripur power plant. In comparison, BPDB \ngeneration units (hydro, gas, diesel, coal, and isolated diesel) have load factors ranging from \n2%  to  49%.  Independent  power  producer  tariffs  charged  to  BPDB  average  Tk2.54  per \nkilowatt-hour (kWh). BPDB units, including Ashuganj Power Station Company Limited, charge \nan average Tk2.10 per kWh. BPDB pooled generation (buying) cost is Tk2.26 per kWh. The \nweighted average cost at the end of 132 kV after technical losses is estimated at Tk2.35 per \nkWh, while the average cost at the end of 33 kV is estimated at Tk2.47 per kWh. \n \n4.  BPDB  bulk  power  sales  create  losses  of  Tk0.46  per  kWh  to  Tk0.63  per  kWh, \naggregating to losses of about Tk9.3 billion per year. BPDB has absorbed the increasing costs \nof bulk power supply and will continue to absorb financial losses unless tariffs are rationalized. \nProvisional  fiscal  year  (FY)  2006  performance  confirms  a  continued  gap  between  BPDB\u2019s \naverage selling price of Tk1.87 per kWh and average supply cost of Tk2.35 per kWh.  \n  2.  Wheeling Charges \n \n5.  PGCB has a tariff that enables it to earn a profit, with wheeling charges of Tk0.2268 per \nkWh and Tk0.2291 per kWh, respectively, for bulk delivery to distribution entities at 132 kV and \n33 kV. This type of rate structure has advantages in that it is easily understood by the users of \nthe grid, it is simple to meter, and the billing is simple to render and to manage. PGCB\u2019s \nfinancial performance has significantly improved over the years and its current financial position \nis strong. Electricity wheeled through the transmission network has been increasing steadily, \nwith growth of 9.2% in FY2004 and 5.9% in FY2005. Transmission system losses declined from \n3.81% in FY2002 to 3.42% in FY2005. Gross revenue has also increased with the present \nwheeling tariff. It is estimated that PGCB\u2019s ongoing and pending investments in transmission \n                                                 \n1 This tariff analysis was undertaken in August 2006 based on the information and data available at that time. \n ", "42  Appendix 3 \nand auxiliary equipment will require an increase in wheeling charge to above Tk0.25 per kWh in \norder to maintain profitability in the short run and Tk0.33 per kWh by 2012.  \n \n  3.  Retail Tariff \n \n6.  Electricity tariffs have remained unchanged since September 2003. There are separate \ntariffs for the categories residential, irrigation, small industrial, nonresidential, commercial, low \nvoltage (11 kV), medium voltage (33 kV), high voltage (132 kV), and street lighting. As in many \ncountries, cross-subsidies exist between customer categories. Currently, BPDB, DESA, and \nDESCO charge identical retail tariffs. Nevertheless, the average effective retail income points to \nvarying performance levels among distribution entities, with DESCO earning Tk3.56 per kWh, \nBPDB earning Tk3.45 per kWh, and DESA earning Tk3.32 per kWh in FY2005. The weighted \naverage retail tariff in taka terms has increased over the past several years, but it is lower today \nin US dollar terms than it was in FY2000: the average retail tariff is $0.052 per kWh today \ncompared with $0.054 per kWh in FY2000. \n7.  Rural electric cooperative (PBS) retail tariffs are structured similarly, but the co-ops are \nallowed to set their own tariffs based on their costs of supply. In general, their tariffs are slightly \nhigher than those of BPDB, DESA, and DESCO and reflect higher distribution costs. Residential \nlifeline tariffs (< 100 kWh per month consumption) range from Tk2.53 per kWh to Tk2.90 per \nkWh compared with Tk2.50 per kWh charged by BPDB, DESA, and DESCO. PBS commercial \ntariffs range from Tk5.11 to Tk5.15 per kWh compared with the BPDB flat rate of Tk5.04 per \nkWh. \n \n8.  The combined market share of BPDB and DESA in terms of bulk supply, sales, and \nretail revenue is more than 50% in the retail distribution sector, while PBSs serve about two \nthirds of the total consumption base. DESCO earns 10% of the total retail revenue from only 3% \nof the customer base, reflecting the best customer mix (the Gulshan area of Dhaka). Under the \ncurrent retail tariff structure, DESA\u2019s gross margin was about Tk0.51 per kWh in FY2005. \nHowever, DESA\u2019s collected revenues have been below cost of service2 since FY2002, except \nthat they were marginally higher in FY2005. After meeting bulk power purchase costs, the \nremaining revenues collected in FY2006 will not be sufficient to cover interest and depreciation. \nDESA\u2019s collection-to-purchase-cost ratio in FY2005 was only 70.0%. DESA fails to collect some \nTk2.3 billion annually from its customers. DESA operated at a negative gross margin until \nDecember  2003,  when  bulk  supply  to  DESCO  and  PBSs  was  discontinued.  DESA  has \naccumulated  significant  liabilities  in  unpaid  bills  to  BPDB  and  PGCB.  DESCO  maintains \nrelatively strong financial performance and has been undertaking various measures to improve \nit, including to outsource its network maintenance, meter reading, and billing functions. As a \nresult,  its  collection-to-purchase  ratio  improved  to  80.9%  in  FY2005.  At  Tk3.56  per  kWh, \nDESCO\u2019s present weighted average electricity revenue is the highest among all power utilities.   \n9.  Similarly to wholesale tariffs, retail tariffs are not structured for cost recovery and are \nessentially inflexible to such external price fluctuations as increases in fuel costs, local currency \ndepreciation,  and  inflation.  Industrial  tariffs  cover  most  of  the  cross-subsidy.  Until  the \nBangladesh  Energy  Regulatory  Commission\u2019s  complete  independence  and  full  authority  is \nestablished, the existing situation will persist and likely deteriorate. In conclusion, it is imperative \nto  rationalize  tariffs  in  order  to  adequately  meet  revenue  requirements,  and  to  undertake \nfinancial and operational restructuring of sector entities to ensure the overall health of the sector.  \n \n                                                 \n2  Cost of service includes depreciation based on historical fixed asset values and excludes returns on equity.  \n ", "  Appendix 3  43 \n \n4.  Financial Restructuring and Impacts on Government\u2019s Budget \n \n10.  The financial restructuring entails cleaning up cross-debts and dues among and between \nsector entities, the Government, and quasi-governmental entities that cannot be recovered and \nwill not directly translate into profitability for sector entities. This is highly relevant to DESA, and \nBPDB will also be at the center of financial restructuring since the power sector remains geared \ntowards a single-buyer principle.  \n \n11.  The Government\u2019s budget is much affected by this sector\u2019s chronic problems. The weak \nsector entities do not service their debts from foreign and government loans and continue to rely \non government budget transfers for capital investment. It is not realistic to expect from them tax \nand dividend revenues. A majority of any tax revenues will be redirected to subsidizing the ailing \npower sector. By undertaking tariff reforms in parallel with financial restructuring, government \nwill be able to lay a stable foundation for sector entities. \n \n  5.  Scenario Analysis \n \n12.  BPDB\u2019s current high generation cost reflects poor operational efficiency and high cost of \npower plants using diesel and furnace oil. Operational efficiency improvements that reduce \noverall system losses and improve collections will, to a degree, also reduce the cost of supply. \nAccording to an assessment by the Government\u2019s Power Cell, when the gas pipeline to Khulna \nis completed in FY2010, BPDB will be able to save Tk5 billion solely through fuel cost savings \nby converting from diesel and oil to gas. Currently, generation cost at BPDB\u2019s Khulna plants is \nabout Tk8.00/kWh, reflecting high oil costs. The Power Cell has calculated that a 10% per year \nrise in wholesale tariff would allow BPDB to incur Tk4,260 million losses in FY2007, Tk450 \nmillion losses in FY2008 and a Tk5,270 million profit in FY2009.  \n \n13.  Three scenario analyses have been undertaken: (i) business as usual (0% increase for \nfuture years), (ii) wholesale cost recovery (a realistic and phased approach to increases in \nwholesale tariffs where the real increase is based on BPDB\u2019s cost of service per kWh sold), and \n(iii) full rationalization (wholesale cost recovery plus increase in retail tariffs).  \n \n    a.  Scenario 1: Business as Usual   \n14.  Tariffs are held steady with projected net increase in generation. As shown in Table \nA3.1, BPDB\u2019s percentage of funding gap (the shortfall generated by deducting cost of service \nfrom projected average electricity revenue) will be 13% in FY2006 and increase to 42% in \nFY2011. In this scenario, BPDB will not be financially sustainable unless heavily subsidized by \nthe Government.  \nTable A3.1: Projected BPDB Performance \n(Tk per kWh) \n \nFiscal Year  2006  2007  2008  2009  2010  2011 \nAverage Electricity Revenue  2.31  2.31  2.31  2.31  2.31  2.32 \nCost of Service per kWh Sold   2.60  2.73  2.83  2.92  3.26  3.30 \nSurplus/(Shortfall)  (0.29)  (0.42)  (0.52)  (0.61)  (0.95)  (0.98) \n% of Funding Gap  -13  -18  -23  -26  -41  -42 \nkWh = kilowatt-hour. \nSources: Bangladesh Power Development Board and Asian Development Bank estimates. \n ", "44  Appendix 3 \n \n    b.  Scenario 2: Wholesale Cost Recovery \n \n15.  A 10% real increase is introduced in January 2007, followed by 5% real raises in \nFY2009 and FY2010, with implementation of automatic tariff adjustment starting from FY2008. \nIndexation for inflation and exchange rate fluctuations results in rises averaging about 6% per \nannum. In this scenario, BPDB will reach break even in FY2009, as shown in Table A3.2. \n \nTable A3.2: Projected BPDB Performance \n(Tk per kWh) \n \nFiscal Year  2006  2007  2008  2009  2010  2011 \nAverage Electricity Revenue  2.31  2.42  2.69  3.00  3.34  3.54 \nCost of Service per kWh Sold   2.60  2.73  2.85  2.96  3.33  3.39 \nSurplus/(Shortfall)  (0.29)  (0.31)  (0.16)  0.04  0.01  0.15 \n% of Funding Gap  -13  -13  -6  1  0  4 \nkWh = kilowatt-hour. \nSources: Bangladesh Power Development Board and Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n    c.  Scenario 3: Full Rationalization \n \n16.  The same increases in the bulk supply tariff (scenario 2) are also applied to retail tariffs. \nIn view of the existing Government policy of national uniform tariffs, the same percentage \nchanges are applied across the board to BPDB, DESA, and DESCO. If the generation cost is \npassed through to retail distributors, DESA and DESCO will no longer avail themselves of the \nexisting artificially low power purchase price (tables A3.3 and A3.4). Provided that DESCO is \nallowed to set its own retail tariffs, DESCO would only need to increase real tariffs by 2% in \nFY2009 and 5% in FY2010 to support its investment needs with inflation adjustments.  \n \nTable A3.3: Projected DESA Performance \n(Tk per kWh) \n \nFiscal Year  2006  2007  2008  2009  2010  2011 \nProjected Average Revenue   3.32  3.49  3.87  4.31  4.80  5.08 \n% Increase    5  11  11  11  6 \nCost of Service per kWh Sold   3.67  3.79  4.18  4.34  4.52  4.65 \nSurplus/(Shortfall)  (0.35)  (0.30)  (0.31)  (0.03)  0.28  0.43 \n% of Funding Gap  -11  -9  -8  1  6  9 \nkWh = kilowatt-hour. \nSources: Dhaka Electric Supply Authority and Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nTable A3.4: Projected DESCO Performance \n(Tk per kWh) \n \nFiscal Year  2006  2007  2008  2009  2010  2011 \nProjected Average Revenue  3.56  3.74  4.15  4.62  5.14  5.44 \n% Increase    5  11  11  11  6 \nCost of Service per kWh Sold   3.18  3.38  3.65  4.00  4.55  4.75 \nSurplus/(Shortfall)  0.38  0.35  0.50  0.62  0.59  0.69 \n% of Funding Gap  11  9  12  13  12  13 \nkWh = kilowatt-hour. \nSource: Dhaka Electric Supply Company Limited and Asian Development Bank estimates. \n ", "  Appendix 3  45 \nC.  Conclusions \n17.  Sizable tariff increases are needed initially to restore some balance between tariffs and \nthe underlying cost of service. Increases should be spread over a number of years to minimize \nthe downstream adverse impact. Wholesale tariffs need to be raised by 10% on average with \neffect from January 2007. Further real increases of 5% are assumed in FY2009 and FY2010. By \n2010, tariffs would thereby be brought into line with the underlying cost of service for BPDB. The \ncumulative impact of efficiency improvements and increasing base load generating capacity will \nmake it possible to reduce tariffs in real terms in later years. The analysis also confirms that (i) \nthe existing PGCB tariffs can be retained until FY2007, (ii) indexation adjustments will be \nneeded from FY2008, and (iii) tariffs can be reduced in real terms in later years. \n \n18.  To make the sector self-sufficient and reduce pressure on the budget, the issues of high \nlosses, poor collection, and low tariffs must be resolved. The Power Division of MPEMR has \nproposed to increase the bulk supply tariff by 10% and raise retail tariffs by 5% for DESA, \nDESCO, BPDB, and REB. In October 2006, a hearing was held on the proposed tariff increase \nby  the  Bangladesh  Energy  Regulatory  Commission.  If  this  proposal  is  accepted  and \nimplemented immediately,3 and if an automatic adjustment mechanism is applied and faithfully \nimplemented from FY2008, the sector entities\u2014particularly BPDB\u2014will be in the black from \nFY2009 with minimum real increases needed in later years. It is also necessary to clean up the \nbalance sheets of BPDB and DESA by undertaking financial restructuring that involves write-off \nof unrecoverable cross-debts and customer receivables and conversion into equity of overdue \ndebt service and long-term loans payable to the Government. In order to continue power sector \ncommercialization and system loss reductions, the key challenge is to restructure the power \nsector\u2019s long-term debt to deliver tariffs that are affordable and also permit Government and \nincoming  private  investors  to  recover  the  costs  of  new  investments.  ADB-assisted  sector \nreforms, together with investment projects are expected to provide a stable fiscal environment \nand an opportunity to achieve long-term sustainability of the power sector. \n                                                 \n3 The proposal was accepted and implemented from 1 March 2007. \n ", "46  Appendix 4 \nEXTERNAL ASSISTANCE TO THE POWER SECTOR \n \nTable A4.1: ADB Lending and Technical Assistance to Bangladesh Power Sector \n \nLoan No.  Amount  Date of Approval  Name of Project \n  ($ million) \n141-BAN(SF)  9.25  17 Oct 1973  Bangladesh West Zone Power \n142-BAN  1.20  17 Oct 1974  Bangladesh West Zone Power \n212-BAN(SF)  4.55  19 Dec 1987  Bangladesh West Zone Power \u2013 Supplementary \n325-BAN(SF)  27.75  9 Dec 1977  Chittagong Power Distribution \n523-BAN(SF)  26.50  22 Sep 1981  Power System Rehabilitation and Expansion \n587-BAN(SF)  35.00  21 Oct 1982  Ashuganj Thermal Power \n636-BAN(SF)  82.00  13 Sep 1983  Power Transmission and Distribution \n683-BAN(SF)  120.00  14 Jun 1984  Sixth Power (Sector Loan) \n751-BAN(SF)  40.50  31 Oct 1985  Seventh Power \n963-BAN(SF)  165.00  11 Jul 1989  Eighth Power \n1356-BAN(SF)  50.00  30 May 1995  Rural Electrification \n1505-BAN(SF)  134.40  18 Dec 1996  Ninth Power \n1730-BAN(SF)  75.00  21 Dec 1999  Dhaka Power System Upgrade \n1731-BAN  82.00  21 Dec 1999  Dhaka Power System Upgrade \n7165/1793-BAN  70.00  5 Dec 2000  Meghnaghat Power  \n1884-BAN(SF)  60.20  17 Dec 2001  West Zone Power System Development \n1885-BAN  138.70  17 Dec 2001  West Zone Power System Development \n2038-BAN  100.00  10 Dec 2003  Power Sector Development Program  \n2039-BAN  186.00  10 Dec 2003  Power Sector Development Project  \nTotal  1,338.05     \n       \nTA No  ($\u2019000)     \n \n095-BAN  250  17 Oct 1973  Bangladesh West Zone Power \n111-BAN  50  9 May 1974  Bangladesh Energy Policy Study \n130-BAN  1,250  31 Oct 1974  Bangladesh Energy Study \n218-BAN  150  9 Dec 1977  Power Systems Rehabilitation \n456-BAN  2,100  15 Apr 1982  Energy Planning \n460-BAN  50  07 Jun 1982  Power System Rehabilitation and Expansion Study \n487-BAN  650  21 Oct 1982  Power System Master Plan Study \n672-BAN  75  15 Feb 1985  Seventh Power \n714-BAN  1,355  31 Oct 1985  East Zone Thermal Power \n1743-BAN  90  18 Aug 1992  Review of Electricity Legislation and Regulations \n1962-BAN  600  11 Oct 1993  Preparation of Power System Master Plan  \n2004-BAN  1,000  26 Nov 1993  Financial Management Upgrade of BPDB and DESA \n2338-BAN  211  30 May 1995  Solicitation for Private Sector Implementation of the \nMeghnaghat Power \n2715-BAN  175  18 Dec 1996  Valuation of Assets of DESCO \n3129-BAN  900  16 Dec 1998  Support for the Energy Regulatory Authority \n3244-BAN  90  20 Aug 1999  Capacity Building of DESCO \n3343-BAN  1,000  17 Dec 1999  Corporatization of the Ashuganj Power Station \n3801-BAN  900  17 Dec 2001  Corporatization of the West Zone Distribution Operations \nof BPDB \n3978-BAN  850  07 Nov 2002  Corporatization of DESA \n4379-BAN  840  23 Aug 2004  Power Sector Development Program II \n4626-BAN  800  02 Aug 2005  Corporatization of BPDB \n4898-BAN  600  22 Dec 2006  Promotion of Private Sector Participation in the Power \nSector  \nTotal  13,986     \nBPDB = Bangladesh Power Development Board, DESA = Dhaka Electric Supply Authority, DESCO = Dhaka Electric \nSupply Company Limited. \nSource: Asian Development Bank files. \n ", "  Appendix 4  47 \nTable A4.2: Bangladesh Power Sector \nExternal Assistance, 1972\u20132005 \n($ million)a \n \nSource  Total \n   \nA.

Linkages to the Country Poverty Analysis  \n \nIs the sector identified as a national    Is the sector identified as a national priority in   \npriority in country poverty analysis?      Yes  country poverty partnership agreement?      Yes \n   \n    No      No \nContribution of the sector/subsector to reduce poverty in Bangladesh:  \nDespite considerable progress, Bangladesh is still one of the world\u2019s poorest nations, with average per capita gross \ndomestic product only marginally higher than the dollar-a-day international poverty standard. At present, only a third of the \npopulation has access to electricity, considered insufficient even by low-income country standards. In 2000, only 12% of \nthe poorest households had electricity connections (3% in rural and 46% in urban areas). People who do have access to \nelectricity receive poor, unreliable services with frequent power shortages and low voltage. The Partnership Agreement \non Poverty Reduction between the Government of Bangladesh (the Government) and Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nemphasizes the need to provide reliable power supply to help reduce poverty.   \nProvision of reliable power supplies is essential for sustained economic growth and other social services. The project loan \nis expected to reduce system losses, and improve quality of supply, leading to more efficient energy use and making \nmore  power  available  to  support  sustained  economic  growth.  Expanding  clean  energy  capacity  and  augmenting \ntransmission grid and distribution systems are expected to result in efficient and more reliable service delivery, particularly \nbenefiting commercial, residential, and agricultural consumers. More reliable power supply will help manufacturing and \nservice industries, including the garment sector that employs several million poor people, particularly poor women. \nAgricultural production is also dependent on energy, especially electricity. Poor and vulnerable consumers, including \nhospitals, schools, and other social facilities, who are often the hardest hit by inadequate power supply, load shedding, \nand poor quality of power, are likely to benefit directly from the project loan. A positive, direct impact on local labor is \nexpected during implementation of the project loan, and an indirect impact will also occur due to enhanced income-\ngenerating opportunities resulting from increased access to electricity. The ongoing multi-funding agency support to the \nGovernment\u2019s power sector reform is an indication of the importance the Government places on the sector\u2019s contribution \nto national development. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis    Proposed Classification: General intervention \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed? \nThe envisaged program and project loans, which follow the Power Sector Development Program approved in 2003, are \nexpected to have indirect benefits on the lives of poor people who use small amounts of electricity and women who \nengage in micro-level production activities.  \nOn the policy side, improved governance through financial stabilization, corporatization, and commercialization will result \nin better service to the public. The functioning independent regulator will provide transparent consultative procedures for \nissuing tariff rulings that protect consumer interests. Possible reduction in costs of products can be expected from price \nrationalization and efficiency gains. Employees will benefit from a new management structure and skills training. In the \npast,  energy  enterprises'  losses  have  put  huge  pressures  on  the  national  budget,  with  adverse  implications  for \nmacroeconomic stability and resource allocation for social spending, particularly for the poor. Capital expenditures, in \n2002 amounting to Tk20 billion annually, or 15% of the Annual Development Program, are equivalent to 90% of total \npublic spending on health and 40% of public education spending.   \nContinued sector reforms will facilitate power utilities to transition from ADB budget \u201csinks\u201d to public revenue sources, \nfreeing up government funds for critical social investments. Increased private sector participation is expected to benefit all \npower consumers. Indeed, the larger power plants operated by independent power producers currently produce the low-\ncost electricity. Reducing current subsidies to the power sector will increase Bangladesh\u2019s social capital, which will, in \nturn, stimulate economic growth, creating a \u201cvirtuous circle\u201d of economic growth that will generate more Government \nrevenue to fund social and poverty reduction spending.  \nUnstable power supply and peak period power cuts affect peoples\u2019 lives in various ways. The poor, and particularly \nwomen who work as front-line workers on a piece basis, are severely affected by power loss. Health clinics and \ndiagnostic services are also seriously disrupted, as many units become nonoperational due to low voltage or have a \nshorter service life because of constant power outages. Water supply and streetlights are of poor quality due to power \ndisruption. Students will benefit from longer study hours, information technology-based learning, and communications \nopportunities. Improved recreational facilities and better municipal services are expected to result from improved power \nsupply. The project loan will reduce lost productivity due to power outages, reduce equipment damage and loss due to \nfrequency fluctuations and low voltage, and reduce potential impairment of emergency services due to load shedding.   \n ", "70  Appendix 11 \n \nC.  Participation Process \n \nIs there a stakeholder analysis?     Yes     No  \nParticipation during project preparation: The executing agencies undertook consultations with local officials and village \nleaders that raised the level of awareness, built local support, and enabled affected people to voice opinions and \nsuggestions for project design and implementation. The poor, women, and other vulnerable groups have been carefully \nconsidered in conducting participatory activities. As a part of social assessment, stakeholders\u2019 consultations in the project \nareas were carried out with the broad objective of ensuring extensive participation of all types of stakeholders. The \nparticipatory approach will be continued during implementation.  \n \nIs there a participation strategy?      Yes     No  \nAll stakeholders were actively involved in order to reduce or avoid negative impacts and ensure that benefits are fairly \ndistributed. Local officials and affected communities were also involved in finalizing the design. In particular, ADB\u2019s \nconsultants hired under the project preparatory technical assistance and the Power Grid Company of Bangladesh \nLimited\u2019s consultants, respectively, carried out independent surveys with affected communities at different stages during \nthe project preparation and finalization of the design. Local authorities were also consulted to define the alignment along \nwith members of civil society and nongovernment organizations. The survey results are provided in the full resettlement \nplan in Supplementary Appendix I.  \n \nD.

The proposed investment components comprise the following: (i) part A: clean energy \ncapacity  expansion,  (ii)  part  B:  transmission  system  efficiency  improvements,  (iii)  part  C: \ndistribution system efficiency improvements in the Dhaka Electric Supply Authority area, and \n(iv) part D: distribution system efficiency improvements in the Dhaka Electric Supply Company \nLimited area. Of these, only part B is expected to have resettlement impacts, mainly temporary. \nA full resettlement plan (RP), salient points of which are identified in this summary, has been \nprepared by the Executing Agency (EA) of part B, Power Grid Company of Bangladesh Limited \n(PGCB). Part B consists of five transmission line subprojects:  \n(i)  about 50 kilometer (km) of 400 kilovolt (kV) line from Meghnaghat to Aminbazar \nand associated line bay extensions;  \n(ii)  about 4 km of 230 kV lines from Aminbazar to Kallyanpur, about 6 km of 230 kV \nunderground cables from Kallyanpur to Old Dhaka Airport, associated line bay \nextensions,  gas  insulated  system  substations  at  Dhaka  Old  Airport,  Dhaka \nUniversity and Cantonment;  \n(iii)  about 73 km of 132 kV line from Magura to Chuadanga through Jhenaidah, two \nnew 132/33 kV system substations in Magura and Chuadanga, and line bay \nextensions at existing Jhenaidah system substation;  \n(iv)  about 40 km of 132 kV line from Naogaon to Joypurhat, one new 132/33 kV \nsystem substation in Joypurhat, and line bay extensions at existing Naogaon \nsystem substations; and  \n(v)  about 45 km of 132 kV line from Thakurgaon to Panchagar, one 132/33 kV \nsystem substation in Panchagar.  \n \n2.  The updated RP will be submitted for approval of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nprior to awarding civil contracts. Land acquisition and resettlement impacts of the subprojects \nhave been assessed and are documented in the RP.  \n \n3.  As shown in Table A12.1, field studies indicate that some 60 households owning some \n26 acres along all the five transmission line routes will be affected by loss of agricultural land. \nPrimarily, this will be due to the land being used for transmission tower footings. Of the 60 \nhouseholds, 35 are expected to permanently lose land to construction of system substations in \nthe 132-kV lines subprojects. The total amount of land lost will be 26 acres. \n \nTable A12.1: Estimated Land Acquisition and Resettlement Impacts \n \nType of Resettlement Effect  Affected Households  Acres (% of total) \nA.

Appeals \nagainst GRC decisions can be addressed by affected persons to appropriate courts of law. \n \nD.  Compensation and Income Restoration \n \n8.  The  project  activities  will  not  involve  displacement  of  people  from  their  present \nhomesteads  and  have  only  limited  impact  on  the  incomes  and  livelihoods  of  the  affected \npersons. This RP was prepared to provide appropriate mitigation measures to look after the \naffected populations and all losses that might be incurred.  \n \n9.  The socioeconomic survey data show that none of the acquired land will affect housing \nstructures. A separate settlement area for relocating households will not be necessary. The \nsocioeconomic survey indicated no plots of agricultural land to be converted for housing in the \nfuture. Houses on the transmission line rights-of-way will be discouraged, and an option for such \nhouseholds has been kept open if these affected persons would like to relocate and convert the \nhouse plot for another purpose, such as a garden or agriculture. The necessary compensation \npackages and budget (detailed in Table A12.4) will be available. Considering their potential \nvulnerability, particular attention will be given to female-headed households and renters. An \naffected  person  may  choose  a  human  resources  development  or  occupational  skills \ndevelopment option, and necessary training will be provided by selected training organizations \nor NGOs. Upon completion of such training, bank loan facilities will be extended in easy terms \nso that the affected persons can begin income generation programs. The program will be \ndesigned for sustainability and systematically monitored and evaluated.  \n \n10.  The subprojects will affect a number of people from agricultural activities. Many of the \naffected persons may have to switch from agriculture activities to small-scale trading or become \n ", "76  Appendix  12 \nday laborers. Compensation packages will be sufficient so that marginal farmers may make the \nswitch, provided they have training or guidance from NGOs appointed for implementing the RP.1 \n \nE.  Institutional Framework and Resettlement Costs \n \n11.  The  EA  will  engage  a  resettlement  specialist  and  NGO,  which  will  constitute  a \nresettlement unit, and through which it will have overall coordination, planning, implementation, \nmanagement and monitoring, and financing responsibilities for the RP. The EA will ensure that \nkey institutions, including the local government, are involved in RP implementation. Further, \nexperienced NGOs will be hired for RP implementation with clearly defined tasks, including \ntraining and community-based social development programs, as appropriate.  \n \nTable A12.4: Total Resettlement Budget for Subprojects \n(Tk million) \n \n  132 kV Magura\u2013 132 kV  132 kV  400 kV  230 kV \n  Jhenaidah\u2014 Naogaon\u2014 Thakurgaon\u2014 Meghnaghat\u2014 Aminbazar\u2014Old \n  Chuadanga  Joypurhat  Panchaghar   Aminbazar   Dhaka Airport \nItem  Land   Budget  Land  Budget  Land  Budget  Land  Budget  Land  Budget \n(acres)  (acres)  (acres)  (acres)  (acres) \nLand for  10.0  45.00  0.6  2.89  5.1  22.50  10.0  0.69  0.0  0.00 \nSubstations:  \nRights-of-Way  392.0  4.38  248.0  2.40  256.0  2.70  672.0  3.50  32.0  0.80 \nfor \nTransmission \nLines \nTotal  402.0  49.38  248.6  5.29  261.1  25.20  682.0  4.19  32.0  0.80 \nkV = kilovolt. \nSources: Power Grid Company of Bangladesh Limited. \n \nF.  Monitoring \n \n12.  Internal  monitoring  by  PGCB  will  deal  with  all  aspects  of  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement  at  the  subproject  level.  The  project  director  or  EA\u2019s  resettlement  unit  will  be \nresponsible for monitoring the progress of resettlement activities at the subproject level. This will \ninclude (i) an information campaign and consultation with the affected persons, (ii) status of land \nacquisition and compensation payments, (iii) compensation for lost structures and assets, (iv) \nrelocation of affected persons, and (v) payment of income-restoration assistance. Benchmarks \nfor subproject level monitoring will come from land acquisition and the census. \n \n13.  The implementing NGO will conduct field-level monitoring and assess the daily operation \nof  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  activities.  The  mechanisms  to  be  used  in  field-level \nmonitoring include (i) review of affected person files, (ii) informal sample survey of affected \npersons, (iii) key informant interviews, (iv) in-depth case studies, and (v) community and public \nmeetings. \n \n14.  External  monitoring  involves  review  of  resettlement  implementation,  in  particular \nverification of the compensation, resettlement, and rehabilitation activities; verification of the \ngrievance redress mechanisms utilization; and provision of feedback. The external monitoring \n                                                 \n1  Implementing NGOs will also liaise with PGCB and the contractors to assist the affected persons, especially \nwomen and other vulnerable persons, as feasible, to obtain employment during the construction period. The EA will \nmake provision in the contractor contracts for preferential employment of qualified affected persons, including \naffected women, in subproject works. \n ", "  Appendix 12  77 \nshall also verify the results of internal monitoring in the field as well as consult with affected \npersons, officials, and community leaders for preparing review reports. The external monitoring \nwill commence in the first quarter of project implementation and shall continue through the \noverall project implementation period. \n \n15.  The specific tasks and methodology for external monitoring shall include (i) review of \npre-project baseline data on affected persons; (ii) identification and selection of an appropriate \nset of indicators for gathering and analyzing information on resettlement impacts; (iii) use of \nvarious formal and informal surveys for impact analysis; and (iv) assessment of the resettlement \nefficiency, effectiveness, impact, and sustainability while drawing lessons as a guide to future \nresettlement policy making and planning. \n ", "78  Appendix  13 \nSUMMARY INITIAL ENVIRONMENTAL EXAMINATION \nA.  Introduction \n1.  Environmental assessment of the proposed policy reforms and investments under the \nSustainable  Power  Sector  Development  Program  (the  Program)  has  followed  ADB\u2019s \nenvironmental policy and assessment guidelines,1 as well as the Government\u2019s environmental \nassessment regulations and guidelines. The executing agencies (EAs) of the Program have \nprepared  an  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE)  for  each  investment  component.  This \nsummary  IEE  outlines  key  aspects  of  the  proposed  program,  environmental  benefits  and \nnegative impacts, proposed mitigation measures, and a preliminary environmental management \nplan (EMP).  \n \n2.  The Program supports the Government\u2019s goal to provide electricity service to all the \npopulation by 2020, and it comprises policy and investment components. The program loan is to \nprovide support and incentives to the Government for power sector reforms through financial \nstabilization and improved governance of sector entities. The investment components are linked \nto ongoing power sector reforms and will expand clean-fuel power generation capacity, enhance \ntransmission network reliability, and improve quality of supply in Dhaka city and surrounding \nareas. Overall system efficiency will be improved. The investment components are presented in \nTable A13.1. \n \nTable A13.1:  Investment Components \n \nComponent / Executing Agency \nPart A: Clean Energy Capacity Expansion / BPDB \n150 MW peaking power plants at Khulna and Sirajganj, plus associated switchgear and transmission facilities \nPart B: Transmission System Efficiency Improvements / PGCB \n400 kV transmission system,  50 kilometer (km) line from Meghnaghat to Aminbazar \n230 kV transmission system improvements from Aminbazar to Dhaka Old Airport and Dhaka University \n132 kV transmission system in western Bangladesh:  73-km line from Chuadanga to Jhenaida to Magura; 40-km \nline from Naogaon to Jaipurhat; 45-km line from Thakurgaon to Panchagar \nPart C: Distribution System Efficiency Improvements in DESA Area/DPDC \nUpgrade of 10 substations; 5 new 33/11 kV substations. \n2 new 132/33 kV substations to meet existing and new demand; 132- and 33-kV overhead lines and underground \ncables \nInstallation of transformers and associated equipment in 3 existing 132/33 kV substations and 33kV underground \ncables \nUpgrading of a 11 kV switching station to a regular 33/11 kV substation \nPart D: Distribution System Efficiency Improvements in DESCO Area/DESCO \nGulshan distribution system upgrade: 4 new 33/11 kV substations  \nMirpur distribution system upgrade: 2 new 33/11 kV substations \nBPDB = Bangladesh Power Development Board, DESA = Dhaka Electric Supply Authority, DESCO = Dhaka Electric \nSupply Company Ltd., DPDC = Dhaka Power Distribution Company Ltd., km = kilometer, kV = kilovolt, MW = \nmegawatt, PGCB = Power Grid Company of Bangladesh Ltd. \nSources: Government of Bangladesh and Asian Development Bank. \n \nB.  Description of the Environment \n3.  The project components are located in four general areas: (i) the existing Goalpara \npower complex in Khulna (part A), (ii) west bank of the Jamuna River just south of the Jamuna \nRiver Bridge (part A), (iii) the Teesta and High Ganges basins and Himalayan piedmont areas of \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2002 Environment Policy of the Asian Development Bank. Manila; and ADB. 2003. Environmental \nAssessment Guidelines. Manila. \n \n \n ", "  Appendix 13  79 \nwestern Bangladesh (part B3), and (iv) the Dhaka metropolitan area (parts B1, B2, C, and D). \nThe project areas can be broadly classified as the greater lower basin of the Bairab, Jamuna, \nMeghna, and Padma river systems, typified by low-relief plains with large braided river channels. \nIn low lying areas, housing and other structures are commonly built on 2\u20133 meter thick sand \nfoundations to prevent flood damage.   \n \n4.  Soils are typical of river floodplains, ranging from sands to clays derived from the greater \nHimalayan  mountain  range.  Land  use  outside  of  Dhaka  is  dominated  by  agriculture,  with \naverage  forest  cover  of  about  10%.  Surface  water  is  commonly  used  for  all  purposes.  \nGroundwater  use  is  also  common,  but  many  areas  of  the  country  suffer  from  high \nconcentrations of arsenic in groundwater. There are no sensitive, threatened, or endangered \nspecies in the areas directly impacted by the investment components, with the exception of \nGangetic dolphins in the river systems.  \n \n5.  Climate is subtropical monsoon with three seasons: (i) summer and pre-monsoon from \nMarch to May, (ii) monsoon from June to October, and (iii) winter from November to February. \nTemperatures are in the range 9\u201325\u00b0 C in winter and 24\u201334\u00b0 C in monsoon season. Annual \naverage rainfall ranges from around 1,850 to 2,500 millimeters per year, concentrated during \nMay-July, with higher average rainfall around Dhaka. Air quality is poor in the Dhaka area, \nmainly due to industrial and transport sources, but it has improved with the introduction of \ncompressed natural gas for transport. Air quality outside the cities is much better, given the lack \nof industrial air pollution sources. Areas north and east of these rivers are in seismic zone II, \nwhich requires that man-made structures be built to withstand 0.05 g ground acceleration. Areas \nsouth and west of these rivers are in seismic zone I, with lower earthquake risk. \n \n6.  Socioeconomic conditions vary between urbanized areas of Dhaka and secondary cities \nin the western zone and the smaller towns and villages in the rural areas. Outside the Dhaka \nurban core is becoming heavily industrialized, with ex-urban growth steadily encroaching on \nagricultural land. Schools and public health services are readily accessible. About a third of the \npopulation currently has some electric power service, although quality and reliability are not \nuniform. More than 90% of the population has access to improved water supply, with piped \nwater common in urban areas and wells common in rural areas. About half of the population has \naccess to improved sanitation.     \n \nC.  Anticipated Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n7.  Environmental  and  social  benefits  will  occur  due  to  expanding  the  electric  power \nnetwork, which uses clean natural gas for power generation (replacing diesel generating sets, \ntraditional wood fuel, and agricultural biomass energy), improving power system efficiency via \nnew transmission and distribution capacity, and reducing aggregate technical and commercial \nlosses  via  system  upgrades.  Environmental  benefits  include  improved  indoor  air  quality, \nreduced regional air pollutant loads, and offsetting growth in greenhouse gas emissions. The \nincremental  power  supplies  from  the  Project  will  be  sufficient  to  serve  at  least  6  million \nconsumers at current per capita generation rates.  \n \n8.  Potential adverse environmental impacts will be restricted to the areas associated with \ninvestment components, and can be avoided and minimized through careful site and route \nselection. Sites of the proposed subprojects have been selected to avoid acquisition of private \nland,  minimize  resettlement,  and  minimize  negative  environmental  impacts.  Table  A13.2 \nsummarizes the anticipated impacts during construction and operations. Overall, the Project will \nhave minimal negative impacts and these can be cost-effectively mitigated.   \n \n ", "80  Appendix  13 \nTable A13.2: Project Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n \nTypes of  Impact Sources  Location of  Pollutant or  Treatment Measures \nImpacts   Sources  Parameter \nNoise:  Construction equipment  Construction sites  70 dBA at site  Equipment to meet local \nConstruction  and equipment repair  and access roads  boundary  noise standards. \nPeriod  yards  Construction scheduling to \navoid evening and \nnighttime disruption. \nNoise:  Power plant  Turbine-generator  70 dBA at site  Locate facility 70\u2013100 m \nOperational    sets  boundary   from nearest receptor. \nPeriod  400-kV transmission line    Use of walls, fencing, \nand associated  Outdoor  and/or greenbelt to \nsubstations  Switchyards  provide partial sound \nbarrier. \nWastewater:  Domestic wastewater  Work site and  BOD, COD, fecal  Primary treatment if \nConstruction  construction  coliform  needed by larger camps \nPeriod  camps \nIndustrial wastewater  Equipment  Petroleum and  Sedimentation and \nfrom construction  maintenance  detergent  biological treatment, if \nequipment maintenance  yards  necessary. \nWastewater:  Domestic wastewater  Power plant and   BOD, COD, fecal  Primary treatment, if \nOperational  substations   coliform   needed. \nPeriod \nCooling water from  Outlet to Bhaidab  Temperature, pH,  Passive cooling; primary \nKhulna and  Sirajganj  and Jamuna  BOD, etc. to meet  and secondary treatment, \npower plants  Rivers   Government\u2019s  as necessary. \n    industrial wastewater   \n    standards   \n       \nIndustrial wastewater  Transformers  Mineral oil; possible  Off-site disposal at \nand oils from  being taken out of  oil with PCBs  licensed treatment facility, \ntransformer replacement  service  or alternate on-site \ntreatment as approved by \npollution control board \nAir Quality:  Dust during construction  Construction  Increased TSP, NO ,  Continuous management \n2\nConstruction  and exhaust gases from  sites, access  SO  levels at  measures to be imposed \n2\nPeriod  construction machinery  roads, and  construction sites and  at the construction sites. \nand vehicles  surrounding areas  surrounding areas \nAir Quality:  Nitrogen oxide (NO )  Khulna and  NO  stack emissions  Best available technology \nX X\nOperational  emissions from power  Sirajganj power  standard: 30 ppm   design; control through \nPeriod  plant  plants    water injection, if \n  Ambient air quality  necessary. \nstandard:  100 \u00b5g /m3 \n(annual average) \nSolid Wastes:  Spoils from earth  Construction sites  Earth and domestic  Spoils to be used as base \nConstruction  moving, construction  and workers'  solid waste  material for substations \nPeriod  debris  camps  and greenbelts. \nSolid Wastes:  Garbage from power  Power plant and  Domestic solid waste  Disposed at facilities \nOperational  plant and substations  Substations  approved by local \nPeriod  government pollution \ncontrol agencies. \nBOD = biochemical oxygen demand, COD = chemical oxygen demand, dBA = decibels (measured in the audible \nrange), kV = kilovolt, NO  = nitrogen dioxide, NO = nitrogen oxides, PCB = polychlorinated biphenyl, ppm = parts per \n2 x\nmillion, SO  = sulfur dioxide, TSP = total suspended particles, \u00b5g = microgram. \n2\nSources: Initial environment examination reports of the executing agencies. \n \n ", "  Appendix 13  81 \nD.  Institutional Requirements and Environmental Management Plan \n9.  A safeguards implementation unit (responsible for environment, resettlement, and any \nother social development obligations) will be established at each of the EAs. All the EAs will \nassume primary responsibility for the environmental assessment and implementation of EMPs \nfor their respective component. ADB will review and approve IEEs and EMPs prior to finalizing \ncontracts and commencingt of work. ADB will review monitoring reports and officially disclose \nthe IEEs on its website.   \n \n10.  The  IEEs  include  EMP  covering  (i)  summary  of  potential  impacts,  (ii)  mitigation \nmeasures,  (iii)  environmental  monitoring,  (iv)  public  consultation  processes,  (v)  outline  of \nresponsibilities  and  authorities  for  implementing  the  proposed  monitoring  and  mitigation \nactivities, (vi) reporting and review procedures, (vii) work plan (including staffing and schedules \nof assigned personnel, as well as activities and inputs of other government agencies and \nstakeholders), (viii) environmentally responsible procurement plan, (ix) cost estimates, and (x) \nmechanisms  for  feedback  and  adjustment.  Table  A13.3  presents  minimum  provisions  for \nenvironmental  monitoring  related  to  procurement  and  construction  for  the  respective \ncomponents. Estimated costs for mitigation and monitoring measures are in Table A13.4. \n \n11.  Detailed design work for each investment component will follow the recommendations of \nthe IEE and EMP.

Public Consultation, Information Disclosure, and Grievances \n12.  Affected communities have been consulted during preparation of the Project in general \nand  during  the  IEEs  in  particular.  There  is  general  support  for  the  proposed  investment \ncomponents, as electricity service is expected to improve and some employment opportunities \nwill be created.   \n \n13.  Each IEE and EMP, and the summary IEE for the investment project, will be translated \ninto local language and made available to the public. A grievance redress committee (GRC) will \nbe established to address all concerns and grievances of the local communities and affected \nparties. The GRC will comprise representatives from local authorities and affected parties, along \nwith other stakeholders as mutually agreed with the local authorities and affected persons. This \ncommittee will address the Project-related grievances of the affected parties and will provide \nthem a public forum to raise their concerns or objections. A senior official from each EA will be \nassigned to the GRC. The GRC will be established in a manner that ensures easy access to \ncommunities and affected parties. The EAs will be responsible to disseminate information about \nthe functional norms of the GRC. The committee will meet at least twice per year, and more \nfrequently if required. \n \n14.  The EMPs will include provisions for both internal and external monitoring. The EAs will \nbe responsible for internal monitoring of the EMP implementation and will forward twice-yearly \nprogress reports to the Government and ADB. The reports will cover EMP implementation with \nattention  to  compliance  and  corrective  action  for  noncompliant  activities.  An  independent \nmonitoring agency will be hired by the EAs with ADB concurrence for undertaking external \nmonitoring of the entire project. The external monitoring agency will be selected within 3 months \nof loan approval. The monitoring agency shall report on a twice-yearly basis directly to ADB and \ndetermine  whether  sound  environmental  management  practices  have  been  achieved,  and \nsuggest  suitable  recommendations  and  remedial  measures  for  midterm  correction  and \nimprovement.   \n \nF.  Conclusion \n15.  The proposed investments will have minimal negative environmental impacts, and these \ncan be successfully mitigated by implementing component-specific EMPs. Environmental and \nsocial benefits of the investment components and long-term program objectives outweigh the \nnegative impacts. Based on environmental assessment activity conducted to date, and subject \nto ADB confirmation of environment categorization, there is no need for a full environmental \nimpact assessment. \n "], "metadata": {"ModDate": "D:20070627160214+08'00'", "CreationDate": "D:20070626082907+08'00'", "Title": "Sustainable Power Sector Development Program", "Creator": "PScript5.dll Version 5.2", "Author": "", "Keywords": "energy power development, sustainable efficiency transmission distribution, private sector participation, bangladesh reducing system losses, electricity master plans", "Producer": "Acrobat Elements 7.0 (Windows)"}}
