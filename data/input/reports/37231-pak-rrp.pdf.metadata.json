An environmental impact assessment was completed.  \n\n \nThe  Punjab  Irrigated  Agriculture  Investment  Program  (PIAIP)  will \nsupport physical and nonphysical investments in the water resource \nand  irrigated  agriculture  sectors  in  Punjab,  Pakistan.  The  PIAIP \ntakes  a  holistic  and  integrated  approach  to  improving  sector \nperformance supported through institutional reform with a focus on \ntransparency,  and \nsustainability,  decentralized  management, \naccountability.  The  PIAIP  will \n(i)  comprehensive \nfinance \nrehabilitation  and  upgrading  (R&U)  of  all  water  resource  and \nirrigation infrastructure; (ii) improved groundwater, conjunctive-use, \nand  surface  water  management  strategies  and  practices;  (iii)  on-\nfarm water management (OFWM), improved irrigation technologies, \nand agricultural support services; and (iv) sector reforms, improved \nmanagement methods, institutional strengthening and restructuring \nfor  water  resource  management,  and  irrigated  agriculture.  The \nPIAIP is expected to support investments in the (i) Lower Bari Doab \nCanal  and  Balloki  Barrage,  (ii)  Pakpattan  Canal  and  Sulemanki \nBarrage,  (iii)  Thal  Canal  distribution  system,  (iv)  Sidhnai  Canal \ndistribution system, and (v) Trimmu and Punjnad barrages. This will \nimpact  between  25%  and  30%  of  the  irrigated  area  in  Punjab  and \ngiven  the  magnitude  and  duration  of  the  PIAIP,  will  have  a \ntransformative  impact  on  the  irrigated  agriculture,  mainstreaming \nbest practices and institutional reform. \n \nTo  support  implementation  of  the  PIAIP,  a  Punjab  irrigated \nagriculture  project  preparation  facility  (PIAPPF)  will  be  developed \nas part of the first project to be funded. The PIAPPF will ensure that \n(i)  forthcoming  projects  are  expeditiously  prepared  to  fully  utilize \nPIAIP  resources,  (ii)  future  projects  are  well  designed  and  meet \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  guidelines,  and  (iii)  the  PIAIP  is \nwell  managed.  It  will  support  (i)  reconnaissance;  (ii)  feasibility \nstudies;  (iii)  detailed  design  for  the  remaining  PIAIP  projects \nidentified  using  the  selection  criteria  in  the  Financial  Framework \nAgreement  (FFA),  schedule  4;  and  (iv)  capacity  development  for \nproject management and planning. \n \n \n\n \nBorrower \n \nClassification \n\n \nEnvironment \nAssessment \n \nInvestment Program \nDescription \n\n \n\n\fii \n\n \n\n \n\nfacilitate \n\nthe  LBDCIP  will \n\nThe  Lower  Bari  Doab  Canal  Improvement  Project  (LBDCIP),  the \nfirst  PIAIP  project,  will  define  the  approach  and  modalities  to  be \nused for subsequent PIAIP-supported projects, and therefore define \nthe  primary  activities  to  be  supported  through  the  PIAIP.  Close \nthe \nmonitoring  and  evaluation  of \nincorporation  of  lessons  into  subsequent  projects.  The  Project \ninvolves  the  Lower  Bari  Doab  Canal  (LBDC)  with  a  200  kilometer \n(km)-long main canal and more than 1,500 km of associated minor \nand  distributary  canals  that  supply  irrigation  water  to  more  than \n700,000 hectares in central Punjab. The system was built between \n1914  and  1917,  and  has  become  an  important  agricultural  area \nserving the markets of Lahore and Multan.  \n \nThe LBDCIP has five components and includes the PIAPPF: \n \n(i) \n\n  Component 1: R&U of the Balloki Barrage will (a) allow more \nirrigation  water  to  flow  to  the  LBDC  main  and  Balloki\u2013\nSulemanki link canals, (b) enhance infrastructure safety, and \n(c) mitigate flood risks and impacts. \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nthe \n\nto  conserve \n\nfield  programs  of \n\n  Component  2:  R&U  of  the  LBDC  distribution  network \n(includes  the  main,  branch,  distributary  and  minor  canals, \nand  field  outlets)  will  increase  the  capacity  to  deliver \nirrigation  water  efficiently,  enhance  safety,  and  fully  involve \nfarmer  organizations  in  R&U  of  their  particular  distributary \nand minor canals as well as help execute civil works. \nComponent  3:  groundwater  management  will  develop \nmanagement  actions  to  conserve  groundwater,  provide \noptions for conjunctive use, and establish best practices for \nland \nsalinity  and  sodicity  management \nresources by (a) supporting farmers\u2019 training through farmer \norganizations  and \nthe  OFWM \ncomponent  (4),  (b)  establishing  a  well-drillers  training  and \ncertification program, and (c) supporting provincial initiatives \non groundwater management. \nComponent  4:  on  farm  water  management  and    agriculture \nwill  develop  a  field  program  in  every  farmer  organization \narea  to  demonstrate  (a)  improved  field  channel  layouts \nresulting  in  improved  irrigation  efficiencies;  (b)  alternative \nwater  application \ntechnologies  and  other  management \ntechniques optimizing the unit productivity of water; (c) laser \ncontrolled  land  leveling;  and  (d)  conjunctive-use  strategies, \nparticularly in saline groundwater areas.  \nComponent  5:  institutional  strengthening  and  operation \nmodernization  will \nfarmer \nfor  operation  and \nresponsible \norganizations \nmaintenance (O&M) of the distributary and minor canals; (b) \nform \nfarmer \norganizations \nin  undertaking  O&M  and  engineering, \ngroundwater  management,  OFWM  support,  agricultural \nsupport  services,  and  administration  and \nfinancial \nmanagement;  (c)  support  analysis  of  LBDC\u2019s  operation \n\nirrigation  management  units \n\nformation  of \n\n(a)  support \n\nto  support \n\nto  be \n\n\f \n\niii\n\nprocedures,  assets,  financial  flows,  staffing,  and  other \nmanagement  concerns  as  the  basis  for  an  operation \nmodernization  strategy  for  improved  management;  and  (d) \nsupport  decentralized  management  of  LBDC  and \nits \ntransition  to  an  area  water  board  (AWB)  governed  by  a \nboard with farmer representation. \n\nirrigation \n\nto  generating  higher \n\n \nIrrigated  agriculture  in  Punjab  (i)  accounts  for  28%  of  Punjab\u2019s \ngross domestic product (GDP) output, (ii) employs 54% of the labor \nforce,  (iii)  produces  90%  of  Punjab\u2019s  agricultural  output,  and  (iv) \nuses  more  than  95%  of  the  water  resources.  Punjab\u2019s  agricultural \nGDP is 66% of the national agricultural GDP. Irrigated agriculture is \nincomes  and  attaining  Punjab\u2019s \ncrucial \ntargeted  6%\u20137%  growth  rate.  The  Punjab  Irrigation  and  Power \nDepartment  (PIPD)  is  responsible  for  O&M,  and  management  of \nsurface \nthat  covers  8.4  million  hectares.  PIPD\u2019s \ninfrastructure has an estimated replacement value of $20 billion and \nincludes  13  barrages,  6,429  km  of  main  canals,  31,214  km  of \ndistributary and minor canals, more than 58,000 field outlets, 3,228 \nkm of flood embankments, and 33 small dams. \n \nThe infrastructure has seriously deteriorated due to (i) age (much is \nnearly  100  years  old),  (ii)  no  asset management  planning, and  (iii) \nchronic  underfunding  and  ineffective  implementation  of  O&M.  The \nestimated  cost  of  deferred  maintenance  is  about  $2  billion;  the \nestimated cost to upgrade the system to modern standards is $3.5 \nbillion.  The  poor  condition  of  some  large  infrastructure  poses \nserious  risks,  yet  the  deteriorated  system  more  generally  means \nunreliable  irrigation  service  delivery,  particularly  to  the  tail  ends  of \nthe  canals.  Farmers  have  adapted  to  unreliable  and  inadequate \ncanal water by developing private tubewells. \n \nDue to (i) lack of reliable flow measurement devices, (ii) inadequate \nmobility  and  communication  of  staff,  and  (iii)  no  accountability  for \naccurate reporting of measurements currently taken, the monitoring \nof  water  distribution  is  weak.  System  operation  is  based  on \ntechnically  advanced \nantiquated  modalities  not  employing \ncontemporary  management  tools.  Staffing  levels,  positions,  and \nskills  mix  need \nimproved \ninfrastructure  and  optimized  operational  procedures  introduced. \nPIPD has nearly 50,000 employees who account for more than 65% \nof the annual O&M budget; many professional staff lack incentives \nor  a  dynamic  career  path  and  receive  compensation  considerably \nbelow private sector norms.  \n \nFarmers are dissatisfied with the irrigation service delivery. They (i) \nhave  not  been  involved  with  system  O&M,  management,  or \ngovernance;  (ii)  are  poorly  informed  of  irrigation  scheduling  and \nsystem  operation;  (iii)  see  little  effect  of  their  irrigation  fees  in \nsystem \nlittle  accountability  and \ntransparency  on  behalf  of  PIPD  staff;  (v)  have  no  assurances  with \n\nimprovement;  (iv)  experience \n\nto  be  updated \n\nto  complement \n\n \nRationale \n\n \n\n\fiv \n\n \n\n \n\nregard  to  the  standard  of  service  delivery;  and  (vi)  have  little \nrecourse for grievance redress. Due to this situation, some farmers \ntake  more  than  their  share  of  water,  tamper  with  canals  to  their \nadvantage,  and  disregard  other  rules.  Institutional  changes  that  (i) \nimprove transparency and accountability; (ii) align system operation \nwith  user  needs;  and  (iii)  give  users  control  over  systems \nmanagement  are  needed,  along  with  improved  infrastructure  and \noperating procedures to achieve maximum improvement in service \ndelivery and agricultural productivity. \n \nPrivate  tubewells  provide  over  half  the  irrigation  water  in  some \nLBDC  areas.  Yet  their  rampant,  uncontrolled  growth  compounded \nby poor drilling has led to falling water tables and associated water \nquality  problems  from  migration  of  saline  and  sodic  water  into \nsweet-water  areas.  Use  of  low-quality  groundwater  has  led  to  soil \nsalinity and sodicity, and consequent low-crop yields, particularly in \ncanal tail reaches. In Punjab, most groundwater recharge originates \nfrom the surface irrigation system, so management of groundwater \nand surface water needs to be undertaken conjunctively from both \nquantity and quality perspectives. The layout of water courses and \nfield  channels  is  inefficient.  In  many  cases,  the  problem  is  made \nmore complex through the use of the surface water field channels to \nconvey groundwater.  \n \nThe  Government  of  Punjab,  with  support  from  the  World  Bank, \ninitiated the Punjab Irrigation Sector Reform Program based on the \nfollowing  four  pillars:  (i)  policy  reforms  to  improve  irrigation  O&M \nand \nresource \nmanagement  reforms  to  improve  allocation,  transparency,  and \nimproved  groundwater  management;  (iii)  reforms \nimprove \nirrigation  quality,  efficiency,  and  accountability  through  greater \nfarmer  participation;  and  (iv)  reforms  to  encourage  introduction  of \ntechnologies.  Effective \nefficient  and  productive \nimplementation of these reforms requires capacity development and \nstrategies for their operationalization at the irrigation system level. \n \nThe  Punjab  Irrigation  and  Drainage  Authority  (PIDA)  Act  (passed \n1997)  establishes \nthe \ndistributary and minor canals, and collect and retain a share of the \nirrigation fees for O&M, and (ii) AWBs to manage irrigation systems \nand be governed by a board of farmer members. Initial progress of \nthe  reforms  was  slow  in  Punjab;  however,  since  2003  85  farmer \norganizations  and  two  AWBs  have  been  formed.  PIPD  has \ncommitted  to  the  establishment  of  100  more  farmer  organizations \nand  two  additional  AWBs.  The  experience  has  been  positive  with \nstrong farmer organizations and improved fee collection and O&M, \nalthough  a  stronger  institutional  framework  is  needed  to  reinforce \nthe process. \n \nConditions  are  favorable  for  continued  sector  reform  as  (i)  Punjab \nhas  meaningful  reform  under  way  in  many  sectors  and  has  strong \n\nfinancial  and  asset  management; \n\nfarmer  organizations \n\nto  manage \n\n(ii)  water \n\nirrigation \n\n(i) \n\nto \n\n\f \n\nv\n\nresult \n\nreformed  and \n\nresources  and \n\nin  economic  growth  and \n\neconomic growth; (ii) the current Government of Punjab is providing \nstrong  leadership  for  reforms  and  sector  investment;  (iii)  the \nGovernment  of  Punjab  is  focusing  on  the  irrigated  agriculture  and \nwater resource sectors; and (iv) ADB, Japan Bank for International \nCooperation, and World Bank are actively engaged in irrigation and \nwater  resources  and  aid  coordination  around  a  common  reform \nagenda. \n \nincreased \nThe  PIAIP  will \nsustainability  of  water  and  land  resources  through  improved \nmanagement  of  Punjab\u2019s  water \nincreased \nproductivity  of  irrigated  agriculture.  The  outcomes  include  (i) \nphysical R&U of irrigation infrastructure, (ii) improved practices and \nstrengthened institutional frameworks for ground and surface water \nmanagement,  (iii)  modernized  irrigation  management  systems \noperation  and  procedures, \nrestructured \n(iv) \ninstitutions  for  water  resources  management  and  irrigation  service \ndelivery, (v) improved financial management and sustainability, and \n(vi) capacity development to support management and institutional \nchanges. \n \nThe  overall  investment  plan  for  the  irrigated  agriculture  sector  in \nPunjab is estimated at $3.5 billion. The investment cost of the PIAIP \nto  be  financed  by  ADB  under  the  PIAIP  is  $900  million.  The \nestimated  cost  of  the  LBDCIP,  the  first  project  under  the  PIAIP  is \n$281.4 million, including taxes and duties of $15.5 million. \n \nThe  Pakistan  Government  asked  ADB  to  extend  financing of  $900 \nmillion over 10 years through a multitranche financing facility (MFF). \nThis \nfinancing \nrequirements  envisaged  under  the  investment  plan  over  the  next \ndecade.  The  ADB \nfunding  covers  physical  and  nonphysical \ninterventions.  Individual  periodic  financing  requests  (PFRs)  will  be \nconverted \nloans.  The  national \nGovernment  and  the  Government  of  Punjab  have  entered  into  an \nFFA with ADB. Pursuant to the FFA, the Government submitted the \nfirst  PFR  for  $227.8  million  equivalent  to  ADB,  comprising  two \nloans:  (i)  $217.8  million  equivalent  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital \nresources, and (ii) $10 million equivalent in Special Drawing Rights \nfrom  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources  (Asian  Development  Fund). \nThe first PFR is presented to the Board for information together with \nthe  FFA.  Prior  to  ADB  acceptance  of  a  PFR,  ADB  will  ensure  that \nthe Government and the Government of Punjab comply in full with \nthe  terms  and  conditions  of  the  FFA.  ADB  teams  will  conduct  due \ndiligence  on  these  to  ensure  they  are  being  satisfactorily  adhered \nto. The minimum amount of each individual PFR or loan request at \nany one time will not be less than $50 million equivalent. \n \nAn MFF of up to $900 million equivalent will provide loans for (i) up \nto  an  aggregate  of  $890  million  equivalent  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary \ncapital resources (OCR) under ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate \n\nfinancing  represents  about  26%  of \n\nindividual  or  separate \n\ntotal \n\ninto \n\nthe \n\n \nImpact and Outcome \n\n \nProgram Investment \nPlan  \n\n \nMultitranche Financing \nFacility \n\n \nFinancing Plan \n\n \n\n\fvi \n\n \n\n \nAllocation and \nRelending Terms \n\n \nPeriod of Utilization \n \nEstimated Program \nCompletion Date \n \nExecuting Agency \n \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\n \n\nloan  will  be  extended \n\n(LIBOR)-based lending facility, and (ii) up to $10 million equivalent \nin  Special  Drawing  Rights  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Fund  resources. \nEach \nto \nto \nsubmission  of  related  PFRs  by  the  Government.

The  PMU  will \nrecruit  all \nconsultants;  (ii)  supervise  the  design  and  construction  supervision \nconsultants, and process payments on all contracts; (iii) coordinate \nand  monitor  the  civil  works;  (iv)  ensure  that  project  works  are \nimplemented  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  safeguard  policies;  (v) \nsupervise  project  groundwater  management,  OFWM,  and \nagriculture initiatives; and (vi) undertake financial management. \n \nAll  procurement  under  the  PIAIP  and  LBDCIP  will  be  undertaken \nfollowing  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (April  2006,  as  amended \nfrom  time  to  time).  A  procurement  plan  will  be  prepared  for  each \nproject under the MFF. \n \nAll consultants will be recruited in accordance with ADB Guidelines \non  the  Use  of  Consultants  (April  2006,  as  amended  from  time  to \ntime). \n \nThe  Government  of  Punjab  has  requested  ADB  agreement  for \nadvance  contracting  with  respect  to  recruitment  of  consultants  for \nthe  LBDCIP  and  has  requested  ADB  to  consider  approval  of \nretroactive financing for the consultants. The Government of Punjab \nhas  been  advised  that (i)  procedures  for  advanced  contracting  are \nnormally used for recruitment of consultants; however, the contract \nis  not  signed  prior  to  signing  of  the  loan;  and  (ii)  approval  of \nadvanced  contracting  and  retroactive  financing  does  not  commit \nADB \nrecruitment  costs. \nNongovernment organizations may be contracted or subcontracted \nto  support \nin \nresettlement  activities.  Retroactive \nsubsequent tranches of the MFF for eligible expenditures, excepting \ncivil  works, may  be  considered  and  allowed  by  management  if  the \nrequest is indicated in a PFR.  \n \n\nloan  project  or \n\nfinancing \n\nfinance \n\nthe \n\nto \n\n \nProcurement \n\n \nConsulting Services \n\n \n\n \n\n\fviii \n\n \n\nProject Benefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\n \n\ncropping \n\nintensity,  and \n\nyields,  greater \n\nThe  greatest  benefit  is  improved  agricultural  production  from \nincreased \nsome \ndiversification  into  high-value  crops.  Improved  water  supply  from \nthe  system  R&U  is  responsible  for  this,  and  the  majority  of  the \nPIAIP  benefits  are  expected  to  stem  from  improved  irrigation \nleading to increased agricultural productivity. The R&U will increase \nsafe distribution capacity from a current maximum capacity of about \n248  cubic  meters  a  second  (cumecs)  to  278  cumecs  for  the \nLBDCIP. The analysis takes into account that farmers at the tail end \nof  canals,  who  have  poorer  access  to  canal  water  and  more \nfrequently  rely  on  low  quality  groundwater,  will  benefit  more  from \nthe  Project,  while  those  at  the  head  end  with  better  canal  and \ngroundwater supply will benefit less. This has important productivity \nand  equity  implications.  Crops  yields  are  anticipated  to  increase \nfrom  about  2%  to  7%  depending  on  the  existing  crop  water \nrequirement deficits, with cotton, wheat, and sugarcane seeing the \nhighest  gains.  Cropping  intensity  throughout  the  LBDCIP  area  is \nanticipated  to  increase  by  about  10%  to  an  annual  average  of \n172%,  which  will  be  driven  by  demographic  pressures  and  further \nfarm fragmentation. The Project, through the OFWM and agriculture \ncomponent,  will  help  accelerate  diversification  to  high-value  crops \nwithin the LBDC.  \n \nThe LBDCIP will help mitigate the risk and damage from floods from \nthe  Balloki  Barrage  and  its  associated  infrastructure  and  from \nrehabilitation of the LBDC main canals, which have several sections \nprone to breaching. This infrastructure R&U and development will (i) \nensure  that  the  water  supply  to  the  rehabilitated  LBDC  and  the \ncropping  areas  supplied  by  the  Balloki\u2013Sulemanki  Link  Canal  is \nsecure,  (ii)  pass  moderate  floods  through  a  new  spillway  reducing \nthe  needs  to  breach  upstream  levies  and  inundate  adjacent  areas \nas  is  the  current  practice,  and  (iii)  construct  two  bridges  to  allow \ntraffic  to  pass  during  and  following  flood  events.  R&U  and \ndevelopment under the PIAIP is expected to provide similar benefits \nfor  barrages  and  other  large  infrastructure.  More  than  half  the \n450,000  farms  in  the  LBDC  are  less  than  2  hectares:  for  farmers \nwith  less  than  1  hectare,  the  Project  will  yield  an  11%  rise  in \nincome. As a whole, about 275,000 farm families or almost 2 million \npeople  will  benefit  from  the  LBDCIP.  The  overall  Project  provides \nan economic internal rate of return of 19.2% and a financial internal \nrate of return of 16.1%. \n \nThe institutional changes supported by the Project will also provide \nimportant benefits including (i) more sustainable O&M; (ii) improved \nmonitoring,  measurement,  and  management  of  water  distribution; \nand  (iii)  irrigation  service  delivery  that  is  more  responsive  to \nfarmers\u2019 needs. \n \n\n\f \n\nix\n\nCommitment to Reform. The Government of Punjab has shown its \ncommitment to reform through development of the Punjab Irrigation \nSector  Reform  Program  as  well  as  through  on  the  ground  action \nand  establishment  of  farmer  organizations  and  AWBs.  The  MFF \nensures  long-term  engagement  by  ADB  with  multiple  projects  to \nwork  with  the  Government  of  Punjab  to  evaluate  and  strengthen \nsector reforms. \n \nRobust  Farmer  Organizations.  Development  of  effective  farmer \norganizations  to  support  sustainable  O&M  is  key  to  the  project \noutcome.  To  ensure  effective  farmer  organizations,  the  Project  will \nsupport  (i)  comprehensive  training,  (ii)  facilities  and  equipment  to \nbolster  farmer  organization  capacity,  (iii)  irrigation  management \nunits  to  ensure  requisite  technical  support  for  O&M,  and  (iv) \nallocation  of  an  increased  abiana  (irrigation  service  fee)  share  if \nneeded to ensure financial sustainability for farmer organizations.  \n \nUtilization  of  Funds.  To  address  the  risk  that  program  funds  will \nnot  be  fully  or  effectively  utilized,  provision  is  provided  for  (i) \nestablishment of a dedicated IPPMU for project preparation, (ii) the \nPIAPPF  with  detailed  terms  of  reference  to  prepare  subsequent \nPIAIP  projects  supported  by  $10  million \nthe  Asian \nDevelopment Fund, (iii) a dedicated PMU for each project, and (iv) \nthe  MFF  modality,  which  allows  IPPMU  and  PMU  staff  to  gain \nexperience  from  each  project  undertaken  so  that  implementation \nwill improve as the program progresses. \n

\n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n1. \nI  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  report  and  recommendation  on  a  proposed \nmultitranche  financing  facility  to  the  Islamic  Republic  of  Pakistan  for  the  Punjab  Irrigated \nAgriculture Investment Program. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nA. \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n2. \nWater  resources  and  irrigated  agriculture  are  vital  to  Punjab,  and  their  improved \nmanagement  and  productivity  are  fundamental  to  continued  economic  development.  Irrigated \nagriculture  (i)  accounts for  28%  of  Punjab\u2019s  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  output,  (ii)  employs \n54% of the labor force, (iii) produces 90% of agricultural output, and (iv) uses over 95% of the \nwater  resources.  Punjab  provides  about  58%  of  the  national  GDP,  and  66%  of  the  national \nagricultural  GDP.  Irrigated  agriculture  is  crucial  to  generating  higher  incomes  and  attaining  the \ntargeted 6%\u20137% growth rate for Punjab (Appendix 2). The Midterm Development Framework of \nthe  Government  of  Punjab  identifies  the  total  outlay  for  the  irrigation  sector  at  $142  million  in \n2006/07,  a  21%  increase  over  the  sector\u2019s  allocation  for  2005/06  and  accounts  for  13%  of  the \ncore Annual Development Program for Punjab (2006/07). The projected outlays for the sector in \n2007/08 and 2008/09 are $200 million and $267 million, reflecting annual increases of 41% and \n33% (includes both foreign and domestic sources of funds). \n \n3. \nThe Indus River canal irrigation system in Pakistan, of which about 56% lies in Punjab, is \nthe  largest  contiguous  irrigation  system  in  the  world.  The  Punjab  Irrigation  and  Power \nDepartment (PIPD) is responsible for operation and maintenance (O&M) and management of the \nsurface  irrigation  system  in  Punjab  and  is  the  primary  agency  concerned  with  water  resource \nmanagement.  Irrigated  agriculture  covers  a  gross  command  area  of  9.5  million  hectares  (ha), \nand has a cultivable command area of 8.4 million ha (Table 1). This extensive infrastructure was \ninitially developed under the British, with a later significant development  thrust under the Indus \nBasin Program during the 1960s, and provides the foundation for irrigated agriculture in Punjab. \nThe  replacement  value  of  government-owned  irrigation  and  water  resources  management \ninfrastructure in Punjab is about $20 billion.1 \n \n\nTable 1: Key Infrastructure of the Punjab Irrigation Systems \n \n\nInfrastructure \nHeadworks/Barrages \nMain Canal Systems \nDistributary and Minor Canals \nTotal Off-Take Capacity and Field Outlets \nGross Command Area \nCultivable Command Area \nOff-Take Capacity and Length of Link Canals \nTubewells \nLength of Surface Drains \nLength of Flood Embankments \nSmall Dams \nha = hectare, km = kilometer, m3/sec = cubic meters/second. \nSource: Punjab Irrigation Sector Reform Program (Punjab Irrigation and Power Department), March 2006. \n \n\nQuantity  \n13  \n24\u20136,429 kilometers (km) \n2,794\u201331,214 km. \n3,399 m3/sec; 58,000 total \n9.45 million ha \n8.41 million ha \n3,115 m3/sec; 850 km \n3,544 \n9,856 km \n3,228 km \n33 \n\n                                                 \n1   This does not include Chasma, Mangla, and Tarbela dams, watercourses, or private investment in tubewells. \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nB. \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\n4. \nIncreased  Demand. Irrigated agriculture in Punjab is constrained by both technical and \ninstitutional  factors.  Population  growth  and  farm  fragmentation  has  resulted  in  significantly \nincreased cropping intensities, driving demand for irrigation water far beyond the original design \ncapacity.  The  systems  were  initially  designed  for  low  cropping  intensities  of  60%\u201380%  with \nassumed  fallow  land.  Current  annual  cropping  intensity  in  Punjab  is  122%  and  in  more \nproductive systems such as the Lower Bari Doab Canal, it may reach 200% in some areas. This \nhas  led  to  increasing  water  supply  shortfalls that  are  exacerbated  during  drought  and  because \nPakistan has lost nearly 30% in its Indus Basin water storage due to reservoir sedimentation. \n \n5. \nIn the immediate future, kharif season irrigation supplies could become greater as global \nclimate change melts glaciers, which currently provide regular flows to the Indus River. However, \nin  the  longer  term,  shortages  will  become  more  severe  as  glaciers  recede  and  higher \ntemperatures  result  in  increased  evaporation  from  storage  reservoirs  and  higher  crop  water \nrequirements. Under this scenario, groundwater recharge and sustainable aquifer yields will also \ndecrease.  Surface  and  groundwater  pollution  is  an  increasing  problem  with  little  effective \nregulation  resulting  in  untreated  industrial  and  municipal  effluent  discharged  into  rivers  and \nsurface  drains,  contaminating  surface  water,  and  potentially  rendering \nthe  underlying \ngroundwater unfit for potable use. \n \nIrrigation  Infrastructure  Deterioration.  While  the  irrigation  and  water  management \n6. \ninfrastructure has provided a seminal development change for Punjab, the condition of much of \nthe infrastructure has seriously deteriorated due to (i) age (much is nearly 100 years old), (ii) lack \nof asset management planning, and (iii) serious underfunding and ineffective implementation of \nO&M.  In  2006,  PIPD  conducted  an  inventory  of  irrigation  infrastructure  assets  to  develop  a \nmanagement  plan  to  comply  with  the  recently  approved  Punjab  Irrigation  Sector  Development \nPolicy loan.2 The infrastructure needs significant investment, and the estimated cost of deferred \nmaintenance  is  about  $2  billion.  To  rehabilitate  and  upgrade  the  system  and  its  structures  for \nenhanced  water  management,  efficiency,  and  equity,  the  cost  is  estimated  at  $3.5  million.  The \npoor  condition  of  some  large  infrastructure  including  barrages  and  main  canals  poses  failure \nrisks and potential civil damage. In most instances, the deteriorated system condition translates \nto unreliable irrigation service delivery, particularly at the tail ends of the canals. Farmers have \nadapted  to  unreliable  surface  water  irrigation  supply  by  installing  private  tubewells  to  increase \nreliability and augment surface water supplies to meet crop demands. \n \n7. \nFinancial  Constraints.  Abiana  (irrigation  service  fees)  to  farmers  have  not  kept  pace \nwith inflation and O&M assistance is needed for distributary and minor canal networks, which are \nmore  prone  to  rapid  degradation.3 In  addition,  a  low  percentage  of  abiana  is  collected  due  to \npoor  service  delivery,  and  inefficient  arrangements  and  lack  of  incentives  for  collection.  The \ndistrict revenue department collects abiana as part of the general revenue, rather than allowing it \nto be retained for canal O&M. This lack of relationship between collection and allocation of funds \nfor O&M compounds farmers\u2019 unwillingness to pay (in addition to poor service delivery). PIPD is \ncurrently  reviewing  the  system\u2019s  O&M  requirements  and  comparing  them  with  budgetary \nallocations to assess the adequacy of the budget. A thorough analysis of all financial flows and \nexpenditure requirements is needed to (i) collect information regarding O&M requirements at all \noperational  levels  of  the  system;  (ii)  provide  a  basis  to  guide  decision  making  for  improved \ncollection, allocation, and expenditure; and (iii) quantify the benefits to be gained through sector \nreform and institutional change. \n\n                                                 \n2   The loan,  which provides budget support,  was approved on 1 June 2006 for $100 million, and is the first of three \n\ntranches that will be processed as individual loans, with the next loan anticipated for approval in 2007.  \n\n3  The collection rates are declining; currently only about 47% of the assessed abiana is estimated to be collected. \n\n\f3 \n\n \n8. \nIrrigation  Management  Concerns.  The  measurement  and  monitoring  of  water \ndistribution  is  constrained  by  (i)  degraded  canal  conditions  and  lack  of  recalibration  of  flow \nmeasurement  facilities,  (ii)  lack  of  design  of  many  structures  to  accurately  measure  variable \nflows, (iii) lack of mobility and communications of staff, and (iv) lack of accountability of accurate \nreporting. System operation is based on antiquated modalities and does not take advantage of \ntechnically  advanced  management  information  systems  (MIS),  improved  communications, \nsimulation  software,  and  other  contemporary  management  tools  that  could  increase  irrigation \nefficiency and equity. PIPD has nearly 50,000 employees who account for more than 65% of the \nannual  O&M  budget.  PIPD  professional  staff  lack  incentives  and  a  dynamic  career  path,  and \nreceive  compensation  considerably  below  private  sector  norms.  Staffing  levels,  position \ndescriptions, and skills mix need to be updated. PIPD\u2019s ability to improve system efficiency and \nequity of water distribution could be greatly enhanced by (i) irrigation structures that increase the \nability  to  measure  and  manage  water  distribution,  (ii)  optimized  operational  procedures \nsupported with the new technology, and (iii) fewer but better trained staff. \n \nThe current situation has led to farmer dissatisfaction. Farmers (i) have not been involved \n9. \nwith irrigation system O&M, management, or governance; (ii) are poorly informed about irrigation \nscheduling and perceive the system is not operated in response to their irrigation needs, (iii) see \nlittle effect of their abiana on system O&M, (iv) experience little accountability and transparency \non behalf of PIPD staff, (v) have no assurances about service delivery standards, and (vi) have \nlittle  recourse  for  grievance  redress.  Thus  some  farmers  take  more  than  their  share  of  water, \ntamper  with  the  canals  to  their  advantage,  and  disregard  rules.  Institutional  changes  that  (i) \nimprove  transparency  and  accountability,  (ii)  align  system  operation  with  user  needs,  and  (iii) \ngive users control over  systems and governance at all levels are needed along, with improved \ninfrastructure and operating procedures to achieve maximum improvement in service delivery.  \n \n10. \nGroundwater  and  Conjunctive  Use.  Private  tubewells  provide  excellent  flexibility  for \ncritical watering and supplemental irrigation water; and provide half the supply in some systems. \nYet their uncontrolled growth has led to overexploitation of groundwater and falling water tables \nin many areas.4 This also leads to water quality problems from lateral migration of saline water \ninto  sweet-water  zones.  Indiscriminate  use  of  low-quality  groundwater  adversely  affects  soil \nquality  and  productivity,  particularly  in  tail  reaches  of  canals  where  reliance  on  groundwater  is \nhigher  due  to  shortage  of  canal  supplies.  Many  areas  suffer  from  secondary  soil  salinity  and \nsodicity,  and  consequently  crop  yields  are  low.  In  the  Punjab  irrigation  systems,  almost  all \ngroundwater  recharge  originates  from  the  surface  irrigation  system,  so  management  of \ngroundwater  and  surface  water  needs  to  be  undertaken  conjunctively  from  both  quantity  and \nquality  perspectives.  Likewise,  farmers  use  both  surface  and  groundwater  for  irrigation,  often \nblending brackish groundwater with high-quality canal water. They need information on options \nto optimize conjunctive use and sustainably manage both groundwater and land resources. \n \nOn-Farm Water Management. Distribution and field application of water below the canal \n11. \noutlet provides an opportunity to improve productivity and sustainable management of land and \nwater resources. The layout of water courses and field channels is often inefficient; the problem \nis  made  more  complex  through  the  use  of  the  surface  water  field  channels  to  convey \ngroundwater.  Farm  distribution  systems  need  to  be  designed  to  take  advantage  of  both  water \nsources  to  support  conjunctive-use  objectives.  Laser  land  leveling  and  improved  irrigation \napplication  techniques  tailored  to  crop,  soil,  and  growing  conditions  would  greatly  increase \nirrigation efficiency. Similarly, improved irrigation technology such as drip and sprinkler systems \nshow tremendous promise to increase productivity and water use efficiency of high-value crops. \n                                                 \n4   In  many  cases,  wells  may  be  drilled  and  constructed  improperly,  resulting  in  inefficient  operation  and  increased \n\nsalinity. \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \nC. \n\n \n\nInstitutional Reform and Lessons Learned \n\n12. \nFramework  for  Sector  Reform.  Reform  in  the  irrigated  agriculture  sector  in  Punjab  is \nmoving forward. The irrigation sector vision set forth in Punjab\u2019s Vision 2020 (from the Midterm \nDevelopment Framework) is to \u201cprovide adequate, equitable and reliable irrigation supplies to the \ncultivable  lands  of  Punjab,  aiming  at  enhanced  agricultural  productivity  and  sustainable \ndevelopment with focus on holistic management and broad based reforms.\u201d The Government of \nPunjab  has  initiated  the  Punjab  Irrigation  Sector  Reform  Program  (PISRP),  which  is  supported \nby  the  World  Bank\u2019s  Punjab  Irrigation  Sector  Development  Policy  loan  and  a  corresponding \npolicy  matrix  with  comprehensive  policy  actions.  The  PISRP  is  based  on  four  pillars:  (i) \ninstitutional  and  policy  reforms  to  improve  irrigation  system  management  and  O&M  to  ensure \nlong-term physical and financial sustainability; (ii) water resource management reforms to make \nwater  allocation  and  distribution  more  transparent  and  improve  groundwater  management;  (iii) \nreforms  to  improve  irrigation  service  quality,  efficiency,  and  accountability  through  greater \nparticipation  of  farmers  and  institutional  reforms;  and  (iv)  reforms  to  encourage  introduction  of \ntechnology to improve water use efficiency and on-farm productivity. Adoption of these reforms \nrequires capacity development and effective implementation strategies at the system level. \n \n13. \nInstitutional  Change.  The  Punjab  Irrigation  and  Drainage  Authority  (PIDA)  Act  (July \n1997)  (i)  established  PIDA  as  a  separate  entity  from  PIPD  for  decentralized  irrigation \nmanagement; and (ii) provided for (a) farmer organizations to manage the distributary and minor \ncanals, and collect and retain a share of abiana for O&M, and (b) area water boards (AWBs) to \nmanage  main  canal  irrigation  systems  and  be  governed  by  a  board  of  directors  with  farmer \nmembers.  The  formation  of  PIDA  and  associated  institutional  changes  were  part  of  reforms \nassociated with the National Drainage Program (NDP), a multi-provincial project funded by ADB, \nJapan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC), and World Bank (Appendix 3 presents external \nassistance  to  the  sector).  Initial  progress  of  the  NDP  reforms  was  limited;  no  farmer \norganizations  or  AWBs  were  established.  However,  since  2003  in  the  Lower  Chenab  Canal \n(LCC) East, 85 farmer organizations have been formed and an AWB established as part of an \nirrigation  rehabilitation  project  financed  under  the  NDP.5 PIPD  has  also  committed  to  establish \n100 more farmer organizations and two additional AWBs in 2006/07 as part of the PISRP.6 As of \n2006,  the  experience  of  farmer  organizations  in  the  LCC  has  been  positive,  with  higher \ncollections for abiana and improved management and O&M of the distributary and minor canal. \nHowever,  the  AWB  in  the  LCC  plays  an  advisory  role  with  no  farmer  representation  yet,  and \nPIPD still maintains management of the rest of the system. Although significant progress is being \nmade, a strengthened institutional and legal framework for farmer organizations and higher level \nreforms for decentralized management would support the process.7 \n \n14. \nConditions  for  Reform.  International  experience  indicates  that  current  conditions  in \nPakistan  support  advancement  of  institutional  reform  and  their  progress  can  be  accelerated \nthrough ADB support that builds on lessons from Pakistan and globally. Reform in a single sector \nis more likely to succeed in the context of overall reform, and Punjab is presently in a much more \nprogressive state, with meaningful reform under way in key sectors with far stronger economic \n\n                                                 \n5   The LCC East project is financed by JBIC. It was initiated using NDP funds during the latter stages of the NDP in \n2002 with the condition of farmer organizations being formed as a requirement for civil works. In 2006 JBIC started \nthe LCC West project under separate funding. \n\n6   Notification to form farmer organizations and establish an AWB in the Lower Bari Doab Canal (LBDC) was given on \n\n11 July 2006, specifying the PIPD superintending engineer for the LBDC Circle as its chief executive officer. \n\n7   The  Government  of  Punjab  has  committed  to  (i)  development  of  a  strengthened  irrigation  management  transfer \nagreement and amended rules for farmer organizations and AWBs for the Government of Punjab\u2019s consideration by \n30 June 2008, and (ii) development of options for sources of legal authority for farmer organizations independent of \nPIDA or the PIDA Act to be submitted for consideration to the Provincial Assembly by 31 December 2008. \n\n\f5 \n\nperformance  than  during  the  NDP.  Current  political  leadership  in  the  Government  of  Punjab  is \nproviding  a  catalytic  dynamism  for  reforms  with  focused  attention  on  investment  and  improved \nproductivity of the irrigated agriculture and water resources sectors. Importantly, the Government \nof  Punjab  through  the  PISRP  is  leading  the  reform  effort  with  on  the  ground  action.  PIPD  is \neffectively  coordinating  the  support  of  ADB,  JBIC,  and  World  Bank  around  a  common  reform \nagenda; continued development partner engagement will help keep the reform process moving \nforward. \n \nLessons  Learned.  In  addition  to  the  less  favorable  climate  for  reform,  the  NDP  faced \n15. \nchallenges relating to implementation and design. As an umbrella project, the NDP attempted to \ninstitute reforms throughout the country instead of exerting more focused effort in a targeted area \nor  province.  The  NDP  included  civil  works,  but  did  not  provide  a  comprehensive  rehabilitation \nprogram  carried  out  with  appropriate  farmer  involvement  targeted  at  turning  over  fully \nrehabilitated  and  upgraded  distributary  and  minor  canals  for  farmer  management.  Capacity \ndevelopment  and  institutional  change  for  farmer  organizations  and  the  provincial  irrigation \ndepartments  were  new  activities  under  the  NDP  and  consultant  recruitment  to  support  these \nefforts  was  significantly  delayed.  Currently,  PIDA  is  directly  engaged  in  forming  farmer \norganizations and has a strong mandate to mobilize more. The NDP also did not provide a clear \ntransition strategy for irrigation departments to shift to the new management paradigm nor did it \naddress  the  details  of  issues  such  as  staff  displacement,  staff  reporting,  financial  flows  and \nsustainability, or improved management and system operations. \n \n16. \nADB  has  not  been  engaged  in  irrigation  lending  in  Pakistan  since  the  NDP.  However, \nADB\u2019s  reengagement  with  irrigated  agriculture  in  Punjab  is  supported  by  recent  sector \ndevelopments  and  current  conditions,  ongoing  sector  reform,  and  a  pragmatic  approach \nsupported  by  lessons  from  the  NDP  and  from  irrigation  reform  across  Asia:  (i)  reforms  in  the \nirrigation  sector  need  to  be  comprehensive  and  address  interrelated  issues  simultaneously;  (ii) \nreforms require the commitment of affected agencies, and wide commitment and acceptance by \nall  stakeholders;  (iii)  institutional  changes  should  be  implemented  and  reinforced  through \nconcurrent  development  of  physical  infrastructure;  (iv)  capacity  building  for  all  institutions  and \nstakeholders is essential; (v) development and participation of farmer organizations and farmers \nare  vital  elements  of  reform;  and  (vi)  a  focus  on  project  management  is  essential  to  (a) \nstrengthen  administrative  capacity  for  effective  implementation,  (b)  ensure  safeguards,  and  (c) \ndevelop  effective  monitoring  and  evaluation  systems.  ADB\u2019s  experience  with \nfarmer \norganizations shows that (i) farmer organization development and reform is a long-term process, \n(ii)  farmer  organizations  need  to  be  involved  in  all  aspects  of  irrigation  development  (including \nrehabilitation)  and  management  for  sustainable  O&M  and  improved  service  delivery,  (iii) \nexecuting  agencies  require  focused  engagement  and  capacity  development  to  create  effective \nfarmer  organizations,  and  (iv)  an  emphasis  on  financial  resources  and  O&M  is  necessary  for \nsustainable  improvements.  All  these  factors  support  a  substantial,  sustained  long-term \ninvestment  program  with  linked  reforms  in  irrigated  agriculture  to  support  continued  economic \ngrowth.  The  multitranche  financing  facility  (MFF)  provides  an  excellent  modality  to  support  this \nlong-term  approach  and  incorporate  lessons  into  project  design.  From  a  broader  development \nperspective,  strong  engagement  in  the  water  sector  in  Pakistan  is  supported  by  (i)  the  ADB \nPakistan  country  strategy  and  program, 8 which  identifies  water  as  one  of  the  key  areas  for \neconomic  development;  (ii)  ADB\u2019s  Medium-Term  Strategy  II,  which  lists  investment  in  water \nresources  as  a  core  ADB  activity;  and  (iii)  the  national  Government  and  the  Government  of \nPunjab,  which  both  identify  investment  in  irrigation  and  water  management  as  a  priority  for \nPakistan for economic development and poverty reduction. \n \n\n                                                 \n8   ADB. 2005.

Manila. \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED INVESTMENT PROGRAM \n\nA. \n\nImpact and Outcome  \n\ninstitutional \n\nframeworks \n\nThe  Punjab  Irrigated  Agriculture  Investment  Program  (PIAIP)  will  result  in  economic \n17. \ngrowth  and  improved  sustainability  of  water  and  land  resources.  This  will  be  achieved  through \nimproved  management  of  Punjab\u2019s  water  resources  and  resulting  increased  productivity  of \nirrigated agriculture. The outcomes from the PIAIP and its investment projects include (i) physical \nrehabilitation  and  upgrading  (R&U)  of  irrigation  infrastructure,  (ii)  improved  practices  and \nfor  surface  and  groundwater  management, 9  (iii) \nstrengthened \nmodernized  irrigation  management  systems  operation  and  procedures,  (iv)  reformed  and \nrestructured institutions for improved and sustainable irrigation service delivery, and (v) capacity \ndevelopment at all levels to support the management and institutional changes. The approach to \nimplementation  of  projects  supported  under  the  PIAIP  is  based  on  integrating  components  to \nachieve these outcomes. This approach combined with sustained ADB engagement through the \nMFF modality will have a transformative effect on the entire sector. \n \n18. \nThe PIAIP is based on the principle that physical and nonphysical investments must work \ntogether  for  effective  development  of  the  irrigated  agriculture  sector.  The  PIAIP  will  use \ninfrastructure development as means to achieve policy reform by facilitating meaningful changes \nin practice at the field level. The four pillars of the PISRP (para. 12) provide an excellent basis for \naddressing  current  problems  in  irrigated  agriculture.  The  value  added  of  the  PIAIP  will  be  to \nimplement PISRP policies along with other institutional reforms at the irrigation system level on a \nwidespread  basis  in  Punjab.  This  requires  development  of  procedures  and  implementation \narrangements, and mandates mobilization of resources to translate recommended policy reforms \ninto action at the farmer level. At the same time, the PIAIP will help support a strengthened legal \nand institutional framework to deepen the reform process. \n \nThe PIAIP strategy is to use the activities and modalities developed through preparation \n19. \nof the Lower Bari Doab Canal Improvement Project (LBDCIP), the first project investment under \nthe  PIAIP,  as  a  model  for  replication  in  other  canal  systems  within  Punjab.  The  LBDCIP \ncomponents  and  their  implementation  arrangements  will  be  replicated  in  subsequent  canal \nprojects  and  thus  the  LBDCIP  provides  a  comprehensive  example  that  defines  the  PIAIP\u2019s \nactivities and objectives. The program and project  staff will closely monitor LBDCIP as a basis \nfor  improving  design  and  implementation  of  successive  projects.  The  MFF  modality  facilitates \nincorporating lessons identified throughout the PIAIP to enhance development effectiveness. \n \n20. \nADB  Special  Funds  resources  are  provided  with  the  first  tranche  as  a  part  of  LBDCIP \nfunding  to  establish  the  Punjab  irrigated  agriculture  project  preparation  facility  (PIAPPF)  to \nsupport  timely  preparation  of  the  remaining  investments  under  the  PIAIP.  The  subsequent \nproject investments include the (i) Pakpattan Canal (about 550,000 hectares [ha]) and Sulemanki \nBarrage,  (ii)  Thal  Canal  (about  800,000  ha),  (iii)  Sidhnai  Canal  (about  330,000  ha),  and  (iv) \nTrimmu and Punjnad barrages. The second tranche is anticipated to include civil works for the (i) \nPakpattan  main  canal;  (ii)  Sulemanki  Barrage;  (iii)  Trimmu  Barrage;  and  (iv)  development  of \nfarmer organizations in the Pakpattan, Sidhnai, and Thal distribution networks. The third tranche \nis  anticipated  to  include  civil  works  for  the  majority  of  the  distributary  and  minor  canals  in  the \n\n                                                 \n9   The Government of Punjab has committed to (i) a process and framework for multistakeholder discussions to review \nwater  sector  institutions  for  management  of the  water  resources  and  service  delivery  by  30  April  2007,  assessing \nsector concerns including (a) resource management for surface and groundwater, (b) irrigation and drainage service \ndelivery, (c) flood control, (d) water quality, (e) hydropower, and (f) water supply and sanitation among others; and \n(ii) development of an overall water sector road map and action plan with time-bound milestones and action plan in \nplace by 30 April 2009. \n\n\f7 \n\nPakpattan,  Sidhnai,  and  Thal  command  areas.  The  fourth  tranche  is  anticipated  to  include  the \nremaining distributary and minor canals and Punjnad Barrage. \n \n21. \nThe Pakpattan (and Sulemanki Barrage) and Sidhnai canals are similar to the Lower Bari \nDoab Canal (LBDC) and are located adjacent to the LBDC in the Multan Zone of PIPD. Once all \nthese  canals  are  addressed  through  the  PIAIP,  they  will  form  a  large  contiguous  block  of \nirrigation  systems  with  (i)  vastly  improved  infrastructure,  (ii)  reformed  irrigation  service  delivery \ninstitutions, and (iii) enhanced management and O&M practices that will provide a critical mass \nto facilitate adoption of best practices in other systems. The Thal Canal and Trimmu and Punjab \nbarrages  are  in  urgent  need  of  R&U;  the  PIAIP  will  substantially  improve  the  physical \nperformance and safety of these facilities while supporting institutional reforms for the Thal Canal \nsystem. \n \n22. \nThe  PIAIP  outputs  will  impact  between  25%  and  30%  of  the  irrigated  land  in  Punjab \n(about  2.3  million  ha),  starting  with  the  LBDCIP.  Due  to  the  investment  size  and  duration  of \nsector  engagement  provided  through  the  MFF,  the  PIAIP  will  facilitate  mainstreaming  of \ninstitutional  reforms,  new  modalities  for  service  delivery,  and  improved  water  resource \nmanagement into the irrigated agriculture sector in Punjab.  \n \nB. \n\nOutputs  \n\n1. \n\nLower Bari Doab Canal Improvement Project  \n\n \n23. \nThe LBDC was built between 1913 and 1917 and is located between Lahore and Multan. \nThe  Balloki  Barrage  on  the  Ravi  River  diverts  water  into  the  LBDC  head  regulator  and  the \nBalloki\u2013Sulemanki  Link  Canal. 10 The  LBDC  main  canal  stretches  over  200  km  and  supplies \nwater  to  about  1,500  km  of  distributary  and  minor  canals,  which  feed  about  3,500  outlets  to \nirrigate  over  700,000  ha.  Approximately  275,000  farm  families  derive  their  livelihoods  directly \nfrom crops grown in the LBDC command area including wheat, rice, maize, cotton, sugarcane, \nfodder,  flowers,  vegetables,  and  citrus  and  other  orchard  crops.  LBDC  is  an  important  and \nprogressive agricultural area in Punjab and offers significant potential for increased productivity. \nThe  LBDCIP  takes  a  holistic  view  of  sector  improvement  for  water  resources  and  irrigated \nagriculture that includes (i) R&U of infrastructure, (ii) improved management of groundwater, (iii) \nimproved  practices  for  on-farm  water  management  (OFWM)  and  irrigated  agriculture;  and  (iv) \ncapacity  building,  sector  reforms,  and  institutional  strengthening.  The  LBDCIP  contains  the \nfollowing five components along with the PIAPPF.  \n \n\na. \n\nComponent 1: R&U of the Balloki Barrage Complex \n\n \n24. \nThe Project will (i) support development of detailed designs and execution of civil works \nfor  R&U  of  Balloki  Barrage,  the  LBDC  head  regulator,  and  the  Balloki\u2013Sulemanki  Link  Canal \nhead  regulator;  (ii)  construct  a  spillway  and  associated  bridges  to  mitigate  flood  risks  and \ndamages; and (iii) prior to the civil works, undertake a hydrological analysis to identify upstream \neffects of the Thein Dam in India, and natural and handmade changes to the Ravi River channel \nto guide infrastructure design and system operation (ponding levels, etc.) of the Balloki Barrage, \nwith respect to probabilities and magnitude of flood flows.11 \n \n\n                                                 \n10  The  majority  of  the  Ravi  River  flows  are  diverted  upstream  in  India,  and  only  about  5%  of  the  water  diverted  at \nBalloki annually originates from the Ravi itself. The bulk of the water supply diverted to LBDC at Balloki comes from \nother link canals, which convey water to the barrage from Mangla Reservoir and the Jhelum and Chenab rivers.  \n11  Results  of  the  analysis  will  be  tested  with  the  physical  model  at  the  Research  Institute  at  Nandipur.  River \n\nmorphological studies will be conducted to support R&U of the Balloki Barrage Complex. \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nBalloki  Barrage.  Balloki  Barrage  will  have  upstream  sediment  deposition  and  a  small \n25. \nstone-pitched  island  removed  to  improve  flow.  To  preclude  the  recurrence  of  sedimentation, \nguidewalls will be constructed above and lead to designated clusters of bays on the right side of \nthe barrage, so that each group can be operated independently to route low flood flows through \nthe  individual  channels  created  by  the  guidewalls,  transporting  sediment  downstream  of  the \nbarrage.  Electomechanical  equipment  will  be  upgraded,  including  installation  of  motors  to \noperate  gates.  The  barrage  R&U  package  will  include  new  piezometers  to  monitor  uplift \npressures, grouting,  downstream  bank  protection,  friction blocks  to improve  energy  dissipation, \nrepair to the stone masonry, and strengthening of the downstream apron. \n \n26. \nHead Regulators. The Balloki\u2013Sulemanki Link Canal has a water allocation of 694 cubic \nmeters/second (cumecs); however, passing this flow through existing structures poses operating \nrisks.  The  LBDCIP  will  support  development  of  an  additional  head  regulator  adjacent  to  the \nexisting head regulator to safely deliver supplies to 694 cumecs. To improve the existing Balloki\u2013\nSulemanki  Link  head  regulator,  the  Project  will  support  grouting  under  the  weir  crest,  an \nadditional  sheet  pile  cutoff  downstream,  and  extension  of  the  stone  apron  downstream.  The \nLBDC head regulator was renovated in the 1960s and requires no structural changes; yet will be \nequipped  with  motors  for  gate  operation  and  undergo  grouting,  plastering,  and  other  remedial \nworks.  \n \nFlood  Improvements.  The  LBDCIP  will  provide  a  concrete  spillway  with  a  design \n27. \ncapacity  of  about  1,416  cumecs  adjacent  to  the  right  side  of  the  barrage.  This  will  pass \nintermediate flood flows, reduce the risk of damage to the barrage, and significantly reduce the \nneed  to  breach  the  upstream  flood  levies  to  inundate  local  areas  during  flood  events  as  is  the \ncurrent  operating  procedure.  Additional  earth  works  will  integrate  the  spillway  into  the  existing \nriver levy network and ensure flood flows are properly directed to the spillway. The spillway will \nchannel flood flows around the barrage and back to the river. Two vehicle bridges crossing the \nspillway  and  an  auxillary  flood  channel  will  be  constructed  on  the  right  side  of  the  barrage  to \ncarry  traffic  on  the  Balloki\u2013Faisalbad  road  that  crosses  the  Ravi  River  on  the  Balloki  Barrage. \nTogether,  these  measures  safeguard  the  barrage  and  mitigate  resulting  floods  to  both  the \nroadway and adjacent land between the spillway and the river. \n \n\nb. \n\nComponent 2: R&U of the LBDC Canal Network \n\n \n28. \nThe  entire  LBDC  system  including  the  main,  branch,  distributary,  and  minor  canals  will \nhave  R&U  to  address  deterioration  from  age  and  deferred  maintenance,  and  to  ensure  their \ncapacity to safely distribute the full sanctioned discharge of 278 cumecs at the head of the LBDC \nmain  canal. 12 An  important  outcome  of  the  LBDCIP  is  to  significantly  upgrade  the  ability  to \nmeasure,  monitor,  and  control  canal  flows  to  improve  water  management  and  enhance  equity \nbetween  the  head  and  tail  of  the  distribution  system.  The  need  for  improved  control  is \nheightened by the marked seasonal fluctuations in water deliveries at the head of the LBDC and \nthe  expanded  command  area.  These  infrastructure  improvements  along  with  improved \nmanagement  methods  using  modern  technology  and  updated  procedures,  and  institutional \nreforms  for  decentralized  management  will  support  significantly  improved  operation  and  more \nefficient water use. Two subprojects were prepared to feasibility during project preparation, 15-L \nand  Jhandraka  distributary  canals,  which  were  used  to  develop  the  R&U  approach  for  the \ndistributary  and  minor  canals.  These  two  canals  will  have  detailed  designs  prepared  and  be \ncontracted immediately at the start of the LBDCIP. \n \nLBDC  Main Canal. The LBDC main canal will be excavated, reshaped, and enlarged in \n29. \nsome  areas  to  redress  sediment  deposition  and  deterioration  of  the  original  profile,  which \n\n                                                 \n12  The system was designed in 1914 for a maximum discharge of 248 cumecs to irrigate 570,000 ha.  \n\n\f9 \n\nconstrict  capacity  and  encroach  on  canal  safety.  Berms  and  canal  banks  will  be  strengthened, \nespecially in areas prone to breaching, and emergency escape capacity increased. Brick lining \nwill  be  used  rather  than  widening  the  earthen  section  to  support  the  increased  flows  while \nminimizing land acquisition and disruption to populated areas. \n \n30. \nThe  LBDCIP  will  rehabilitate  numerous  main  canal  structures  including  55  distributary \nhead regulators, 20 fall bridges and fall flumes, 14 road bridges, numerous direct off-takes, an \naqueduct, drainage siphons, and other structures. Most new head regulators will be the constant \nhead  orifice  type  that  allow  easy  and  accurate  flow  measurement  and  improved  water  control, \nand  are  key  to  improved  management  in  the  upgraded  system.  Twenty  existing  brick  and \nmasonry  bridges  with  drops  will  be  replaced  with  new  reinforced  concrete  structures.  Gated \ncross  regulation  will  be  incorporated  in  a  number  of  structures  enhancing  control  in  diverting \ndischarges to off-taking canals. Upstream and downstream sections of the fall structures will be \nreplaced and energy dissipation enhanced for improved safety. Except where load and roadway \nwidth requirements have greatly increased, road and footbridges not serving hydraulic functions \nwill be retained and strengthened. New structures crossing the main canal will require temporary \ndiversion of all or part of the main canal flow. Adequate contracting capacity and equipment will \nbe available to ensure that construction activities for the main canal can be completed over two \nto  three  seasons  during  normal  canal  closure  periods  or  extended  closures  with  adequate \nnotification and no impacts. \n \n31. \nThe  Distribution  Network.  The  condition  of  distributary  and  minor  canals  is  inferior  to \nthe main canal due to high sediment deposition, substantial buffalo trespass, and less assiduous \nmaintenance. Extensive earthworks for reshaping are required in some areas, and buffalo ghats \nwill  be  constructed.13 Head  regulators  with  higher  crests  and,  where  possible,  increased  canal \ngradients  and  narrowing  of  canals  will  be  used  to  pass  sediment  loads  more  effectively  to  the \nfields.  Canal  lining  will  be  provided  in  saline  groundwater  areas  to  prevent  seepage  and  to \nsupply  more  canal  water  to  these  farmers  where  fresh  water  is  needed  for  mixing  with \ngroundwater,  leaching,  and  land  reclamation.  About  20%  of  the  distributary  and  minor  canal \nlength will be lined, using concrete over a geomembrane protected by geotextile. \n \n32. \nStructures  for  distributary  and  minor  canals  will  include  gated  constant  head  orifice \nregulators  at  the  head  of  the  channel  and  additional  structures  including  weirs  to  ensure \nequitable distribution and eliminate the need for gate operation. To ensure maximum operating \nefficiency and minimize sediment deposition, discharge through the distributary and minor canals \nwill be maintained at between 80% and 105% of their design discharge. Head regulators in the \nminors will be the constant head orifice type except in tail reaches where flumes will be used at \nthe  head  of  the  off-takes  due  to  small  discharges.  Measurement  capacity  will  be  increased \nthrough improved structures at the head of the canal and the use of measuring flumes in the tail \nreaches.  All  outlets  from  the  canals  to  the  field  distribution  network  will  be  replaced  with \nstructures  that  ensure  equitable  distribution  and  adjusted  to  maximize  sediment  passage. \nBridges,  village  access  for  washing,  and  other  minor  infrastructure  throughout  the  distributary \nand minor canal network will undergo R&U or be newly constructed.14 \n \n33. \nR&U and Farmer Organization Participation. A vital project activity is the integration of \nthe  institutional  development  of  farmer  organizations  and  their  direct  involvement  in  the  R&U \nprocess for their particular canal.15 Important outputs from this process include (i) the opportunity \nfor farmer organizations to develop their management capacity and social capital, (ii) a sense of \n\n                                                 \n13  Buffalo ghats are designated areas for buffalos to wallow to prevent damage to the canal. \n14  In  the  cases  of  bridges,  washing  access  areas,  and  other  small  canal-related  infrastructure  in  or  near  villages, \n\nwomen\u2019s committees will be formed and consulted regarding the location and design of the structures. \n\n15  No R&U will take place in canals prior to the formation of farmer organizations.  \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\nownership  over  their  canal,  and  (iii)  hands-on  experience  to  teach  O&M  skills  for  use  as  they \ntake  control  to  manage  the  system.  The  Project  will  ensure  the  following  farmer  organization \nparticipation:  (i)  farmer  organizations  will  identify  and  propose  civil  works  on  the  basis  of  a \nsystem walk-through with project management unit (PMU) consultant staff; (ii) PMU consultants \nwill  carry  out  surveys  and  design  in  consultation  with  the  farmer  organizations;  and  (iii)  farmer \norganizations  will  be  part  of  a  PMU  staff  and  PIPD  committee  that  will  facilitate  dialogue, \nfeedback, and if necessary, actions to address the concerns of the farmer organization with the \nR&U.  The  walk-through  will  also  be  used  to  identify  small-scale  civil  works  that  are  within  the \nfarmer  organization\u2019s  capacity  to  execute  under  community  contracting  with  appropriate \nsupervision  as  a  means  of  generating  additional  revenue,  leverage  R&U  resources,  and \ncontribute  to  farmer  organization  development.  These  works  will  be  included  in  the  larger  civil \nworks  contracts  for  the  distributary  and  minor  canals. 16  Procedures  for  farmer  organization \nparticipation will be refined in the two initial subprojects, 15-L and Jhandraka. \n \n\nc. \n\nComponent 3: Groundwater Management  \n\n \nThe LBDCIP will support a comprehensive approach to groundwater and conjunctive-use \n34. \nmanagement  that  includes  (i)  improving  the  knowledge  base  and  research,  (ii)  policy  planning, \n(iii) awareness raising, (iv) targeted interventions and improved practices, and (v) monitoring and \nevaluation.  Although  data  exists  from  agencies  such  as  the  Water  and  Power  Development \nAuthority,  Directorate  of  Land  Reclamation  (under  PIPD),  and  Public  Health  Engineering \nDepartment, it has not been collected regularly with consistent protocols and coordinated under \na single agency. The Project will establish a cell within the PMU to collect, manage, and analyze \ngroundwater data in LBDC starting with compilation of historical data and identification of existing \nmonitoring wells to initiate development of a quality and quantity groundwater model. Additional \nwells that provide water quality samples as a function of depth will be developed as needed to \nenhance the model\u2019s accuracy; this may be supported by other remote sensing or assessment \ntechniques. Wells for controlled pumping tests aimed at quantifying aquifer characteristics will be \nconstructed  at  sites  within  the  LBDC  command.  A  comprehensive  geographic  information \nsystem  database  will  be  developed  to  support  groundwater  management  and  all  project \nactivities. 17 Although,  the  primary  groundwater  activity  will  address  agriculture  water  issues, \npotable  supply  wells  will  be  addressed  for  monitoring  and  analysis.  An  important  part  of  the \nactivity will be to monitor the impacts of project interventions to improve the knowledge base to \nsupport comprehensive groundwater management. \n \n35. \nThe  analysis  and  modeling  of  groundwater  provide  the  opportunity  to  confirm  trends  in \nwater  table  fluctuations  during  and  after  project  implementation  to  identity  areas  at  risk  where \ninterventions  are  needed.  The  groundwater  component  will  develop  policies  and  management \nactions  for  farm  and  canal  command  to  address  agricultural  issues,  as  well  as  coordinate  with \nPIPD\u2019s provincial groundwater management cell and address aquifer and provincial groundwater \nconcerns.18 Due to the size of the LBDC and the number of tubewells, the initial policy approach \nwill be one of awareness and education. An important output of the groundwater component will \nbe to work with the PMU and provincial officials to develop farm strategies and interventions for \ngroundwater  management  and  conjunctive  use  (including  alternative  technologies,  e.g., \n\n                                                 \n16  The LBDCIP will support a pilot trial for full farmer organization management of civil works in a small and technically \nappropriate minor or distributary canal undergoing R&U later in the Project. The farmer organization participation will \nbe supported by the PMU. This experience could be replicated later under the PIAIP in subsequent canals. \n\n17  Although the geographic information system will be developed under the groundwater component, the geographic \ninformation  system  database  will  be  expanded  and  managed  by  the  PMU  as  a  general  management  tool  for  all \nproject activities.  \n\n18  A  provincial  groundwater  cell  within  PIPD  is  being  established  under  the  Punjab  Irrigation  Sector  Development \n\nPolicy loan. \n\n \n\n\f11 \n\nskimming  wells).  These  practices  and  interventions  will  be  (i)  demonstrated  independently,  (ii) \nincorporated into the Project\u2019s field programs under the OFWM and agriculture component, and \n(iii)  disseminated  by  other  stakeholders  and  scaled  up  and  implemented  by  the  irrigation \nmanagement units (IMUs), farmer organizations, and other stakeholders. \n \n36. \nGiven the rapid growth of tubewells, a pivotal leverage point is the well-drilling industry. \nTechnical  drilling  specialists  will  work  with  the  drilling  community  to  observe  current  practices, \ncreate  training  programs,  develop  a  certification  program,  and  make  recommendations  for  a \nregulatory framework to govern the drilling industry. Field and classroom training will be provided \nfor drillers and other stakeholders, along with a certification program targeting both drillers and \nfarmers. 19  Materials  and  programs  targeted  at  farmers  will  be  developed  to  increase  their \nknowledge  of  well  technology,  drilling  practices,  and  the  certification  program  to  make  them \nbetter  informed  consumers  of  drilling  services.  These  materials  and  a  list  of  certified  drillers \nwhere applicable will be distributed through the IMUs, farmer organizations, and other channels. \n \n\nd. \n\nComponent 4: On-Farm Water Management and Agriculture  \n\n \nThe OFWM and agriculture component will ensure that improved water delivery through \n37. \ncanal systems is complemented by improved water management at the field level and results in \nhigher  agricultural  productivity.  This  component  will  support  development  of  field  programs  on \nselected  watercourses  in  the  service  area  of  each  farmer  organization.  Each  field  program  will \ninclude a 40 ha area that combines (i) improved field channel layout and operation of the water \ncourse,  including  application  of  conjunctive  use  strategies,  particularly  in  saline  groundwater \nareas  where  mixing  or  alternating  surface  and groundwater  irrigations is  required;  (ii)  practices \nfor improved application efficiency, scheduling irrigation based on crop water requirements, and \nother  management  techniques  to  maximize  production  per  unit  volume  of  irrigation  water;  and \n(iii) laser leveling. This approach will provide an opportunity for farmers to observe best practice \nand  ensure  a  strong  linkage  between  the  groundwater  component  and  the  OFWM  and \nagriculture component to (i) disseminate conjunctive use strategies, (ii) demonstrate alternative \nirrigation technologies reliant on groundwater, and (iii) monitor impacts. The OFWM activities will \nbe  implemented  by  the  Directorate  of  On-Farm  Water  Management  (DOWFM),  a  part  of  the \nDepartment of Agriculture, which will have staff in each of the IMUs. \n \nThe component will establish demonstration plots employing drip and sprinkler irrigation \n38. \ntechnology within the field program areas. Selection of the field program areas will depend upon \nexisting  cropping  patterns  that  can  benefit  from  these  technologies  and  must  be  targeted  at  a \nrange of farmers, especially those who can readily adopt these practices. Involvement of private \nsector and other service providers who can work with farmers to develop strategies to scale up \nthese applications will be facilitated through the Project. \n \n39. \nThe  LBDC  command  area  has  relatively  progressive  farmers,  a  growing  percentage  of \ndiversified  and  higher  value  crops,  and  good  access  to  markets  in  Lahore  and  Multan.  The \nLBDCIP  will  demonstrate  the  benefits  of  improved  inputs  for  increased  productivity,  integrated \npest management techniques, polythene tunnels and seed beds for early vegetable production, \npostharvest activities, and other production and management options. Field program agricultural \nactivities  will  be  developed  to  provide  strategies  for  saline  or  sodic  soils.  They  will  provide  an \nopportunity  to  observe  a  range  of  improved  agricultural  practices,  OFWM  and  conjunctive-use \nstrategies,  and  advanced  irrigation  technologies  in  a  single location  throughout  the LBDC.  The \n\n                                                 \n19  Findings from project preparation indicate that many wells are spaced inappropriately, completed and screened at \nthe wrong depth with inappropriate perforation size and pattern, constructed using inappropriate materials, and are \ngenerally of poor quality. \n\n \n\n\f12 \n\n \n\nProject  will  support  farmer  and  farmer  organization  exchanges  and  training  courses  to  help \nensure farmers\u2019 exposure to improved practices and build capacity. \n \n\ne. \n\nComponent 5: Institutional Strengthening and Operation \nModernization \n\n40. \nTo  derive  maximum  benefit  from  the  LBDC  system  R&U,  institutional  reforms  and \ncapacity development for irrigation O&M and management are required. The Project will support \n(i)  development  of  farmer  organizations  and  supporting  IMUs,  (ii)  modernized  operation  and \nmanagement  methods,  (iii)  effective  and  accountable  decentralized  management  through  an \nAWB, and (iv) enhanced capacity for all stakeholders. \n \n41. \nKhal  Panchayats.  At  the  water  course  level,  the  LBDCIP  will  support  development  of \nkhal  panchayats,  water  user  associations.  PIDA,  with  support  from  the  PMU  and  project \nconsultants,  will  develop  and  implement  a  mobilization  program  for  the  approximately  3,200 \nwater courses in the LBDC.20 The mobilization program will (i) include awareness raising of the \nfarmer  organization  program  objectives,  and  rights  and  responsibilities;  (ii)  identify  khal \npanchayat  members  and  conduct  elections  for  officers;  (iii)  establish  management  procedures \nfor khal panchayat officers; and (iv) select a khal panchayat chairperson who will represent the \nkhal  panchayat  in  the  farmer  organization  and  be  responsible  for  khal  panchayat  abiana \ncollection. \n \n42. \nFarmer  Organizations.  Formation  of  60  to  70  farmer  organizations  on  the  distributary \nand  minor  canals  of  the  LBDC  is  a  fundamental  project  output.21 Following  mobilization  of  the \nkhal panchayats and formation of the farmer organizations, a farmer organization management \ncommittee will be formed and intensive training for farmer organization members provided.22 The \nProject  will  fund  establishment  costs  and  office  renovation  for  farmer  organizations;  the \nGovernment of Punjab will provide office space for each farmer organization from existing PIPD \nor  other  Government  of  Punjab  facilities.  The  Project  will  support  development  of  a \ncomprehensive and explicit service agreement between the farmer organizations and AWB that \ntransparently specifies the responsibility, authority, accountability, and actions to be taken should \neither party fail to fulfill its obligations. \n \nIrrigation  Management  Units.  To  ensure  successful  execution  of  farmer  organization \n43. \nresponsibilities, IMUs will be developed and supported. The IMUs  will report to a  committee of \nfarmer organization members they serve and provide requisite professional capacity to manage \nthe  distributary  and  minor  canals.  The  IMUs  will  be  formed  concurrently  with  the  farmer \norganizations, and support farmer organization participation in the minor and distributary R&U to \nfacilitate the process and develop skills to manage the system. The IMUs will respond to needs \nof the khal panchayats and farmer organizations, and provide the following technical services: (i) \nO&M and engineering guidance for minor and distributary canals; (ii) groundwater, conjunctive-\nuse, and OFWM strategies; and monitoring of these activities; (iii) agricultural services; and (iv) \n                                                 \n20  The Project will coordinate efforts and where feasible build upon work already undertaken by the DOFWM, which is \nimplementing the National Program on Watercourse Improvement to improve water courses and field channels. This \nprogram  provides  legal  registration  of  water  user  associations  often  having  the  same  members  as  the  khal \npanchayats.  \n\n21  The  general  principle  is  that  farmer  organizations  will  be  formed  according  to  hydrologic  boundaries  and  the \naverage size will be about 10,000 ha. However, in very large distributary canals, multiple farmer organizations may \nbe formed along various reaches of the canal with a federated structure for management.  \n\n22  The  farmer  organization  will  have  a  general  body  consisting  of  all  the  khal  panchayats  chairpersons  and  elect  a \nmanagement committee consisting of a president, vice president, secretary, treasurer, and five executive members \nwith three from the tail reaches. Each farmer organization will develop a communication plan to provide information \nto the khal panchayats. Standing committees for ongoing functions of the farmer organization may be formed, and \nmaintenance plans, financial management plans, and other plans will be developed. \n\n\f13 \n\nadministration and financial management including billing and record keeping for abiana. About \n12  IMUs  will  be  established  in  the  LBDC  command,  each  supporting  six  or  seven  farmer \norganizations. The IMUs will provide the technical interface on behalf of the farmer organizations \nwith  the  AWB  for  scheduling,  rotation,  and  other  operation  and  management  functions  of  the \nmain and branch canals that affect delivery to the distributary and minor canals. \n \n44. \nThe Project will enable IMUs to fulfill their role through training and provision of essential \nequipment, including (i) basic office equipment and computers, (ii) technical equipment for O&M, \n(iii) vehicles, and (iv) communications to ensure responsiveness. The Government of Punjab will \nprovide office space for each IMU from existing PIPD or other Government of Punjab facilities. \nThe  IMUs  will  employ  qualified  technical  staff  dedicated  to  serve  the  farmer  organizations \nachieving  economies  of  scale,  precluding  the  need  for  each  farmer  organization  to  expend \nexcessive  funds  to  support  staff  for  its  particular  service  area.23 IMU  staff  will  be  hired  by  the \nfarmer organizations with PIDA and PMU assistance. Staff will initially be supported with project \nfunds  that  will  eventually  decline  and  be  replaced  with  the  farmer  organization\u2019s  abiana  share. \nEach  IMU  will  be  assigned  a  DOFWM  officer,  who  will  be  responsible  for  managing  the  field \nprograms  in  each  the  member  farmer  organization  and  provide  OFWM  service  within  the  IMU \nservice area. One PIDA staff member will also serve in the IMU to provide ongoing training and \ncoordination. \n \nFarmer Mobilization and Training. The mobilization of the khal panchayats and farmer \n45. \norganizations, and training of the farmer organizations and IMUs will be provided through three \nfarmer organization support offices located at the project implementation units (PIUs). PIDA will \nmaintain  a  project  management  office  (PMO)  in  Sahiwal  for  overall  coordination.  The  farmer \norganization support offices will manage the farmer organization and IMU training program that \nwill include (i) institutional overview, and roles and responsibilities of stakeholders in the irrigation \nsector; (ii) administrative management; (iii) financial management; (iv) water charge assessment \nand  billing  procedures;  (v)  system  maintenance;  (vi)  gender;  and  (vii)  system  operation  and \nwater management. Consultant support will strengthen PIDA\u2019s training and program delivery with \nspecialists  who  have  international  experience.  Training  of  farmer  organizations  will  be \nindependently  evaluated  including  performance-based  benchmarking  of  farmer  organizations \nand PIDA. \n \nOperation  Modernization  and  Change  Management.  For  the  main  canal,  the  Project \n46. \nwill  support  an  analysis  of  all  LBDC  management  and  operation  procedures  to  develop  a \nstrategic  plan  to  transform  the  AWB  for  the  LBDC  into  a  more  efficient  and  responsive \norganization.  The  strategy  will  define  an  operation  and  management  improvement  process \nbased  on  the  principles  of  decentralization,  transparency,  accountability,  and  efficiency.  The \ninitial activities will involve analysis of (i) the LBDC AWB\u2019s institutional mandate and activities; (ii) \nall  operation  procedures  including  financial  management,  procurement,  O&M,  monitoring  and \nevaluation,  water  distribution,  and  other  activities;  (iii)  current  staffing  assignments  and  future \nhuman resource needs in light of the (a) system R&U, (b) updated management procedures, (c) \nthe goal to improve staff capacity and revitalize a culture of corporate professionalism, and (d) \nthe use of improved information technology and MIS; and (iv) financial and asset management.24 \n\n                                                 \n23  A PIDA study found that an area greater than 40,000 ha is required for a technical manager to be financially viable. \n24  A detailed financial analysis will be undertaken to (i) identify fund flows throughout the system, (ii) assess O&M and \nmanagement  costs  for  existing  operation  as  a  basis  to  estimate  rationalized  costs  for  a  modernized  system  at \nvarious  management  levels  (farmer  organization/minor  distributary;  AWB/main  and  branch  canals;  and  barrages); \n(iii)  provide  a  basis  for  the  equitable  share  of  abiana  between  farmer  organizations;  AWB;  as  well  as  entities \noperating the barrage, link canals, and Mangla Dam; (iv) make transparent all subsidies for delivery of service; and \n(v) provide a basis for enhanced cost recovery and financial viability of irrigation service delivery. \n\n \n\n\f14 \n\n \n\nAn  awareness  program  and  staff  participation  will  be  promoted  to  solicit  suggestions,  gain \nacceptance, and provide strategy input.  \n \n47. \nImplementation  of  the  Modernization  Strategic  Plan.  Based  on  the  comprehensive \nassessment, a strategic plan will be developed that presents a blueprint for more effective AWB \nmanagement and transition options. The strategic plan will focus on LBDC, yet provide a basis \nfor replication in subsequent canals under the PIAIP. The Project will support implementation of \nthe  strategic  plan  including  (i)  revised  operating  procedures  and  manuals  to  exploit  the  new \ninfrastructure  and  use  of  information  technology  and  MIS  in  all  aspects  of  operation,  and  be \nmore efficient and responsive to fluctuations in water supply and irrigation service demands; (ii) a \nrationalized  staffing  plan  with  revised  positions  and  job  descriptions,  recruitment  standards, \ncompensation,  and  redeployment  plan;  (iii)  intensive  capacity  development  that  includes \nclassroom,  on-the-job,  and  regional  and  foreign  training  for  senior  staff;  and  (iv)  purchase  of \ncomputers  and  other  information  technology,  MIS,  communications,  and  other  equipment  to \nsupplement existing assets of the LBDC AWB.  A financial and asset management strategy will \nbe  developed  to  ensure  all  levels  of  the  system  have  adequate  operational  resources  and  a \nrationalized  sharing  plan  for  abiana.25 The  modernization  plan  will  focus  on  integrating  farmer \norganization and IMU responsibilities into overall system operation. \n \n48.  Management  Transformation.  New  procedures  include  improved  monitoring  and \nevaluation,  revised  staff  evaluation  procedures  consistent  with  modern  management,  and \naccountable service contracts between the AWB, farmer organizations, and the Government of \nPunjab.  Once \nthe  new  operational  procedures,  enhanced  staff  capacity,  and  revised \norganizational  structure  are  in  place,  the  strategic  plan  will  ensure  the  capacity  of  AWB  senior \nofficers  to  manage  LBDC  operations  without  PIPD  support.  This  final  phase  will  include \ncompetitive recruitment of the AWB director and senior staff who will manage all lower level staff \nand  be  supported  with  funds  from  abiana  and  any  needed  subsidy  would  not  be  tied  to  PIPD. \nThe  AWB  will  have  transparent  accounting  with  the  eventual  goal  of  financial  sustainability. \nSenior  staff  would  report  to  and  be  supported  by  a  board  with  mixed  representation  of  PIDA, \nPIPD, other technical experts, and farmers representation.26 The management transfer will have \nclose  monitoring  and  supervision  until  such  time  that  performance  is  judged  to  be  fully \nsatisfactory. \n \n\n2. \n\nPunjab Irrigated Agriculture Project Preparation Facility \n\n \n49. \nThe  PIAPPF  will  ensure  that  (i)  forthcoming  projects  are  expeditiously  prepared  to  fully \nutilize  program  resources,  (ii)  future  projects  are  well  designed  and  meet  ADB  guidelines,  and \n(iii) the PIAIP is well managed. The PIAPPF will support capacity development for the investment \nprogram  planning  and  management  unit  (IPPMU),  which  will  have  overall  responsibility  for  the \nPIAIP and PIPD staff within PIPD\u2019s Strategic Planning Cell. The PIAPPF activities will include (i) \n\n                                                 \n25  Since  abiana  is  the  primary  source  of  revenue  available  for  farmer  organizations,  the  organization\u2019s  abiana  share \nshould be adequate to cover the O&M costs of the minor and distributary canals. While the goal is full cost recovery \nfor the AWB, subsidy may need to be continued for some time as is the case  with PIPD\u2019s current operation. This \nshould  be  phased  out  as  R&U  and  operating  efficiency  under  the  AWB  will  lead  to  lower  O&M  costs.  Short-term \nchange in the abiana rate is not supported through the LBDCIP, but a rationalized abiana rate will be needed in the \nlonger term. \n\n26  A  timetable  with  milestones  that  defines  this  transformative  process  for  the  LBDC  AWB  will  be  a  precondition  for \napproval of the second tranche of the PIAIP. While the AWB would be responsible for operation of the LBDC, the  \nGovernment  of  Punjab  would  still  have  significant  control  over  operations  through  the  following  measures:  (i)  the \nGovernment of Punjab would own the LBDC assets; (ii) the AWB would be fully accountable to the Government of \nPunjab  through  the  signing  of  the  service  agreement;  (iii)  all  decisions  will  need  to  be  consistent  with  the  service \nagreement; (iv) the Government of Punjab would retain the right to inspect and audit the AWB according to terms \nand  conditions  specified  in  the  service  agreement;  and  (v)  the  Government  of  Punjab  would  have  the  right  to \nintervene if the AWB does not perform according to the terms of the service agreement. \n\n\f15 \n\nsupport to the IPPMU in reconnaissance analyses and reports on candidate projects to ensure \nconformance  with  the  program  selection  criteria;  (ii)  feasibility  studies,  institutional  analyses, \nenvironmental  assessments,  resettlement  plans,  and  preliminary  design  to  establish  economic, \ntechnical, and social viability of subsequent investments; (iii) analyses of design options for R&U \nof barrages, headworks, main canals, distributary and minor canals, and other infrastructure; (iv) \nagreements  with  concerned  farmer  organizations  over  the  package  of  R&U  improvements  for \ntheir  distributary  and  minor  canals;  (v)  surveys  and  geotechnical,  hydrological,  and  other \ninvestigations  necessary  for  final  design;  (vi)  detailed  design,  construction  drawings,  bills  of \nquantities,  technical  specifications,  and  tender  documentation  for  bid  packages  for  subsequent \nprojects;  and  (iv)  detailed  implementation  arrangements,  service  delivery  mechanisms,  and \nmonitoring and evaluation procedures for subsequent projects under the PIAIP. \n \nC. \n\nSpecial Features \n\n50. \nAs demonstrated through the LBDCIP, the PIAIP takes a holistic and integrated approach \nto improvement of irrigated agriculture and management of water resources through (i) R&U of \nall  system  infrastructure,  from  the  minor  canals  to  the  barrage,  and  stresses  OFWM  to  ensure \nenhanced  water  supply  is  used  productively;  (ii)  explicit  consideration  of  groundwater  and \nconjunctive use to address productivity and sustainability; (iii) strengthened operational systems \nand  improved  water  management  capacity,  and  (iv)  strengthened  policy  frameworks  for \nimproved  water  management  and  decentralized  institutions  through  farmer  organizations  and \nAWBs mainstreaming reform into irrigated agriculture and water resources. \n \nD. \n\nProgram Investment Plan \n\nThe  total  cost  of  the  PIAIP  is  $3.5  billion.  The  MFF  will  finance  up  to  an  equivalent  of \n51. \n$900  million  and  total  project  costs  will  be  shared  with  the  Government  of  Punjab  and \ncofinanciers. The MFF first tranche is estimated at $281.4 million, including taxes and duties of \n$15.5 million, and includes the LBDCIP and PIAPPF (Appendix 4 provides detailed costs).

The financing will be provided under \nan  MFF  according  to  ADB  policy.  Under  the  MFF,  separate  multiple  loans  will  be  extended  to \nfinance  projects  subject  to  submission  of  related  periodic  financing  requests  (PFRs)  by  the \nGovernment.  The  Government  and  the  Government  of  Punjab  have  entered  into  the  financial \nframework  agreement  (FFA)  with  ADB,  and  will  comply  with  FFA  requirements.  The  FFA \nsatisfies  the  requirements  set  forth  in  Pilot  Financing  Instruments  and  Modalities. 27  The \nGovernment intends to finance the PIAIP with the submission of at least four PFRs for individual \nloans. The last loan is expected to be executed no later than 31 December 2015. Pursuant to the \nFFA,  the  Government  submitted  to  ADB  the  first  PFR  for  $227.8  million  equivalent,  which \ncomprises $217.8 million equivalent in OCR funds and $10 million equivalent in Special Drawing \nRights from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources.28 The first PFR is submitted to the Board together \nwith  the  FFA  for  information.  The  investment  amount  of  the  PIAIP  was  determined  based  on \nsector  needs,  funds  devoted  to  the  sector,  identified  projects,  the  absorptive  capacity  of  PIPD \nand  the  Government  of  Punjab,  and  anticipated  inflation  over  the  program  period.

This  cofinancing  is  not  confirmed,  however  once  the  cofinancing  is  secured,  it  will  be \nused to offset the Government of Punjab\u2019s contribution to the Project. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f17 \n\nand other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan and project agreements as applicable. \nThe Government has provided ADB with (i) the reasons for its decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s \nLIBOR-based lending facility on the basis of these terms and conditions, and (ii) an undertaking \nthat  these  choices  were  its  own  independent  decision  and  not  made  in  reliance  on  any \ncommunication or advice from ADB. \n \n54. \nThe  ADF  (Special  Funds  resources)  loan  will  be  used  under  the  first  PFR  for  capacity \nbuilding,  institutional  strengthening,  support  of  the  IPPMU,  and  preparation  of  subsequent \nprojects. The loan will have a 32-year term, including a grace period of 8 years, an interest rate \nof 1% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter, and such other terms \nand conditions set forth in the loan and project agreements. \n \nFor all the loans, the Borrower will be the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, which will make \n55. \nthe  proceeds  available  to  the  Government  of  Punjab  on  the  same  terms  and  conditions.  The \nGovernment of Punjab will bear the foreign exchange risk for all loans. \n \nF. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n1. \n\nProgram and Project Management \n\n56. \nPIPD  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  for  the  PIAIP,  LBDCIP,  and  subsequent  projects \nfinanced  under  the  PIAIP.  PIPD  will  have  overall  responsibility  for  (i)  implementation,  (ii) \nreporting  on  both  physical  and  financial  progress,  and  (iii)  assuming  direct  responsibility  for  all \nirrigation  system  R&U  works.

For  both  the  barrage  and  the  canal  civil  works  contracts,  the  role  of  the \nengineer36 will  be  assigned  to  the  design  and  supervision  consultants  who  in  turn  will  provide \ndesign  services,  contract  document  preparation,  and  help  with  prequalification  exercises  and \nevaluation of bids received from prequalified contractors as well as provide subsequent detailed \nconstruction  supervision.  Payment  to  civil  works  contractors  will  be  made  by  the  PMU  on \ncertification by the engineer, and R&U of the distributary and minor canals will be implemented \nusing similar procedures and approval authorities but providing for full consultation with relevant \nfarmer organizations. \n \n63. \nGroundwater database generation, groundwater level and quality monitoring, modeling of \nthe  aquifer system,  and  liaison  with  province-wide  groundwater  management  organizations  will \nbe  handled  by  a  groundwater  cell  within  the  PMU  headed  by  a  deputy  director,  groundwater \nunder  the  director,  monitoring  and  evaluation,  which  will  be  supported  by  consultants.  OFWM \nand associated agricultural support demonstration activities envisaged under the proposed field \nprograms will be carried out by DOFWM through an LBDC OFWM project office in liaison with \nthe  PMU.  This  office  will  support  the  full-time  services  of  12  deputy  OFWM  officers,  one \nassigned to each IMU. \n \n64. \nfarmer \norganizations will be managed by the transition wing of PIDA. PIDA staff responsible for these \nactivities  will  be  posted  to  the  three  farmer  organization  support  offices  to  be  temporarily \nestablished  (for  the  initial  3  years  of  the  Project)  at  Okara,  Sihawal,  and  Khaniwal.  The  farmer \norganization  support  offices  will  maintain  full  liaison  with  the  relevant  PIU  to  ensure  optimal \nmeshing  of  institutional  and  system  improvement  activities.  Following  initial  mobilization  and \ntraining,  continuing  training  and  support  targeted  at  strengthening  farmer  organizations  will  be \nprovided by the 12 IMUs with support of PIDA. PIDA will provide one coordinator and DOFWM \nwill  have  one  officer  assigned  to  each  IMU  to  assist  the  farmer  organizations  and  manage  the \nfield  programs.  The  remaining  staff,  including  the  IMU  manager,  will  be  hired  by  the  farmer \norganizations with PIDA and PMU support. The Project will support IMU staff for about 4 years \nafter  which  time  declining  project  funds  will  be  provided  for  2  additional  years  while  farmer \norganizations transition to support IMU staff from abiana collections. The IMU will be governed \nby a committee of members from farmer organization management committees from the farmer \norganizations served by the IMU. \n \n\nSocial  mobilization  and  capacity  building \n\nthe  khal  panchayats  and \n\nfor \n\n3. \n\nImplementation Period \n\n65. \nADB\u2019s financial support for the PIAIP will be extended over 10 years commencing in 2007 \nand ending in 2017. The last date on which disbursement under any loan under the MFF may be \nmade is 30 September 2017. It is expected that the last loan will be executed no later than 31 \nDecember  2015.  The  LBDCIP  will  be  implemented  over  6  years  commencing  in  early  2007. \n\n                                                 \n36  The  engineer  has  final  approval  authority  for  technical  matters,  development  of  bidding  materials,  and  sign  off  on \n\ncontracting supervision as defined in standard FIDIC general conditions of contract. \n\n \n\n\f20 \n\n \n\nFormation and training of farmer organizations will start in year 1 and be completed by year 3. \nSurvey and detailed design work necessary prior to award of civil works contracts will commence \nin  year  1  with  construction  commencing  in  mid-2008  and  completed  by  the  end  of  2012.  The \nproject implementation schedule is presented in Appendix 6. \n \n\n4. \n\nProcurement \n\n66. \nAll  procurement  under  the  PIAIP  and  LBDCIP  will  be  undertaken  following  ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Guidelines (April 2006) as amended from time to time. With respect to the LBDCIP \ncivil  works  packages  for  R&U  of  Balloki  Barrage,  LBDC  main  canal,  and  bulk  of  the  irrigation \ndistribution  system  will  be  awarded  under  international  competitive  bidding  among  suitably \nprequalified contractors.37 Civil works contracts costing less than $5.0 million including those for \nR&U  of  the  Jhandraka  and  15-L  distributary  canals,  which  will  be  awarded  in  two  distributary-\ndefined civil works contracts of only medium scale (to facilitate their early construction), will not \nbe suitable for or of interest to international contractors. Moreover, adequate national contracting \ncapacity  exists  to  successfully  undertake  these  works  at  a  reasonable  cost;  thus  they  will  be \nundertaken  under  national  competitive  bidding  procedures  among  suitably  prequalified  local \ncontractors.38 Before the commencement of any procurement activity under national competitive \nbidding,  ADB  and  the  Government  will  review  the  Government\u2019s  public  procurement  law  to \nensure  consistency  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines.  Any  necessary  modifications  or \nclarifications  will  be  reflected  in  the  procurement  plan.  Supply  contracts  estimated  to  cost  the \nequivalent  of  $500,000  equivalent  and  more  will  awarded  on  the  basis  of  international \ncompetitive  bidding;  those  costing  $100,000  up  to  $500,000  equivalent  will  be  awarded  on  the \nbasis of limited international bidding; and minor items costing $100,000 equivalent or less will be \nprocured under shopping. The procurement plan is in Appendix 7. In addition, procurement plans \nwill be prepared for each project to be financed under the MFF indicating the particular contracts \nfor  goods,  works,  and  consulting  services  required;  proposed  methods  of  procurement; \nthresholds; and related ADB procedures.  \n \n\n5. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n67. \nGiven the increasing demands on PIPD capacity, consulting support for both overseeing \nthe PIAIP and implementing the LBDCIP is required. The IPPMU will be supported by a package \nof  consulting  services  for  the  PIAPPF  to  prepare  and  carry  out  final  design  for  the  ensuing \nprojects  to  be  financed  under  the  MFF.  This  package  will  provide  for  159  person-months  of \ninternational consultants and 1,250 person-months of national specialists to prioritize investment \noptions,  prepare  projects  to  the  feasibility  level,  and  carry  out  detailed  design  and  tender \ndocument preparation.39 For the LBDCIP, contracts for five packages of consultant services will \nbe awarded comprising about 333 person-months of international specialists and 1,423 person-\nmonths of national experts to support all facets of project implementation. Details with regard to \nall  packages,  staffing, and  terms  of  reference are  presented  in  Supplementary  Appendix  A.  All \nconsultants  to  be  financed  under  the  PIAIP  including  those  for  the  LBDCIP  will  be  recruited  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (April 2006, as amended from time \nto time). The selection and engagement of required services will be through firms selected under \nquality-  and  cost-based  selection  procedures  and  individuals  as  required.  The  PMU  will  recruit \n\n                                                 \n37  While the packaging reflected in the procurement plan will be generally adhered to, the PMU and their consultants \nwill design the prequalification exercises and tendering procedures such that qualified  bidders can bid on multiple \npackages  to  ensure  an  acceptable  level  of  competition  while  maintaining  the  interest  of  the  larger  international \ncontractors, the result being both quality and cost-effective civil works. \n\n38  All  civil  works  contracts  awarded  under  international  competitive  bidding  and  national  competitive  bidding  will  be \n\nsubject to ADB\u2019s prior approval procedures. \n\n39  The  consultants  to  support  the  IPPMU  will  be  recruited  by  the  PMU  on  behalf  of  the  IPPMU  in  view  of  the \n\nprocurement and contracting expertise available within the PMU. \n\n\f21 \n\nnongovernment organizations for resettlement activities that will be contracted on a competitive \nbasis acceptable to ADB. \n \n68. \nThe Government of Punjab has asked ADB to provide advance contracting with respect \nto recruitment of all consulting packages for the LBDCIP. ADB has advised the Government of \nPunjab  that  procedures  for  advanced  contracting  are  normally  used  for  recruitment  of \nconsultants  without  delay,  however,  the  contract  is  not  signed  prior  to  signing  of  the  loan;  and \nadvanced  contracting  does  not  commit  ADB  to  finance  the  Project  or  recruitment  costs.  The \nGovernment  of  Punjab  has  asked  ADB  to  consider  approval  of  retroactive  financing  for  the \naforementioned  activities.  The  Government  of  Punjab  was  informed  that  expenditures  are \neligible for retroactive financing up to 12 months prior to signing of the financing agreement not \nto exceed 20% of the loan amount. Retroactive financing may be used in subsequent tranches \nfrom  the  MFF  for  eligible  expenditures,  except  civil  works,  with  management  approval. \nRetroactive financing in subsequent tranches of the MFF for eligible expenditures, excepting civil \nworks, may be considered and allowed by management if the request is indicated in a PFR. \n \n\n6. \n\nAnticorruption Policy \n\nits  commitment \n\nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \n69. \nwith  PIPD.  Consistent  with \nto  good  governance,  accountability,  and \ntransparency,  ADB  reserves  the  right  to  investigate,  directly  or  through  its  agents,  any  alleged \ncorrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the PIAIP. To support these efforts, \nrelevant  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s  anticorruption  policy  are  included  in  the  loan  regulations  and  the \nbidding  documents  for  projects  under  the  PIAIP.  In  particular,  all  contracts  financed  by  ADB  in \nconnection with the projects under the PIAIP will include provisions specifying the right of ADB to \naudit and examine the records and accounts of PIPD and all contractors, suppliers, consultants, \nand other service providers as they relate to the PIAIP. \n \n70. \nA  number  of  implementation  arrangements  have  been  formulated  specifically  to  ensure \ngood  governance  under  the  Project  and  will  be  incorporated  in  the  loan  agreements  for  future \nprojects to be financed under the PIAIP, particularly in the area of financial management. PMU \nstaff at the director level (grade 19) have been provided within the PMU specifically addressing \nfinancial  management  issues  associated  with  project  implementation.  Both  the  project  director \nand  the  director,  finance,  will  be  supported  by  the  services  of  a  project/financial  management \nspecialist during the initial 5 years of the Project, which will also serve to build up the requisite \ncapacity at all levels of the PMU. A procurement specialist will be placed in the PMU during the \ninitial period of the Project to support procurement activities and develop procurement capacity. \nIn addition, each of the consulting teams providing design and construction supervision services \nfor  major  project  works  will  include  a  contracts  engineer  to  ensure  that  bid  evaluation  and \ncontract award procedures comply with ADB guidelines and internationally accepted practice. \n \n\n7. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n71. \nTo expedite implementation of projects, including the LBDCIP, through the timely release \nof  funds,  imprest  accounts  will  be  established.  Under  the  LBDCIP  an  imprest  account  will  be \nestablished in Lahore for the use of the PMU. All imprest accounts will be established with the \nNational  Bank  of  Pakistan;  and  be  managed,  replenished,  and  liquidated  in  accordance  with \nADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook  (2001)  and  detailed  arrangements  agreed  to  by  the \nGovernment of Punjab and ADB. The initial amount to be deposited in an imprest account and \nceiling  will  not  exceed  6  months  of  estimated  expenditure  or  10%  of  the  total  loan  amount, \nwhichever is less. The currency will be US dollars. Statement of expenditures procedures will be \nused  to  reimburse  eligible  expenditures,  or  to  liquidate  and  replenish  the  imprest  accounts  for \nany  individual  payment  under  $100,000.  Loan  disbursements  for  goods  and  services  under \n\n \n\n\f22 \n\nmajor  civil  works  and  consultant\u2019s  contracts  will  be  made  using  direct  payment  methods  as \noutlined in the Loan Disbursement Handbook. Subsequent PFRs will be mutually exclusive, i.e., \neach  PFR  will  be  under  a  separate  loan  agreement.  The  loan  agreement  will  describe  the \ndetailed disbursement arrangements for a specified PFR, which will be discussed between ADB \nand the Government. Loan disbursements will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement \nHandbook, as amended from time to time. \n \n\n8. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\nDOFWM,  IPPMU,  PIDA,  PMO-barrages,  and  PMU,  will  prepare  and  maintain  separate \n72. \naccounts for project-related expenditures adequate to identify goods and services financed from \nthe loan proceeds, financing resources received, expenditures incurred for the Project, and use \nof  local  funds.  The  PMU,  through  the  director,  finance,  and  staff  supported  by  the \nproject/financial management consultant, will consolidate and review accounts; and after auditing \nsubmit  them  to  PIPD,  Department  of  Agriculture,  Department  of  Finance,  and  ADB.40 Project \naccounts  will  be  audited  annually  by  the  auditor  general  of  Pakistan  and  the  audited  accounts \nand audit report submitted to ADB no later than 6 months following the close of the fiscal year to \nwhich they relate. The audit report will include a statement verifying that funds disbursed by ADB \nagainst statements of expenditure have been used for the purpose for which they were provided. \nThe imprest accounts and statement of expenditures will be audited as a part of the regular audit \nof project accounts and should have separate opinions. \n \n73. \nDOFWM,  PIDA,  PIU,  and  PIU  will  be  responsible  for  preparing  quarterly  financial  and \nphysical progress reports on their respective LBDCIP activities and submitting these to the PMU \nfor  consolidation.  Subsequently,  the  PMU  will  provide  quarterly  progress  reports  relating  to  the \nLBDCIP to the IPPMU, PIPD, and ADB. The quarterly reports are to be submitted within 1 month \nfollowing the end of the quarter to which they relate.41 Within 3 months of Project completion, the \nPMU will submit to ADB a project completion report. In addition to quantifying physical progress \nand  monitoring  the  utilization  of  loan  funds,  all  reports  will  include  a  progress  statement \nregarding  the  mobilization  of  farmer  organizations,  their  effectiveness  in  discharging  their \nresponsibilities,  and  progress  in  establishing  and  staffing  IMUs  to  provide  necessary  technical \nbackstopping to the farmer organizations. Information with respect to compliance with covenants, \nimplementation  progress,  land  acquisition,  resettlement  progress,  and  major  issues  and \nproblems will also be included. \n \n74. \nThe  IPPMU  will  prepare  and  submit  to  ADB  quarterly  and  annual  progress  reports  on \nPIAIP implementation, the form and content of which will be agreed with ADB. The IPPMU will \nactively monitor feasibility preparation and final design activities in accordance with the program \nimplementation  schedule,  and  will  keep  ADB  informed  of  any  significant  deviations  from  the \nschedule. Details regarding specific project activities reported on by the relevant PMUs need not \nbe duplicated but succinctly summarized. At the end of the  MFF period, a program  completion \nreport will be provided to ADB within 3 months. \n \n\n9. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\nA  project  performance  management  system  for  the  LBDCIP  will  be  established  in  the \n75. \nPMU with links to each PIU divisional office, the PIDA management office, and DOFWM within 6 \nmonths  of  loan  effectiveness.  The  system  will  be  tailored  to  project-specific  requirements  and \nprepared  in  consultation  with  PIPD,  PIDA,  and  DOFWM  as  well  as  concerned  (and  initially \n\n                                                 \n40  The  findings  and  recommendations  of  the  financial  management  assessment  during  the  project  preparatory \n\ntechnical assistance will be incorporated in the project administration memorandum. \n\n41  In  addition,  PMU  will  prepare  other  such  information  and  reports  relating  to  the  Project  and  its  implementation  as \n\nADB may reasonably request. \n\n \n\n\f23 \n\nmobilized)  khal  panchayats  and  farmer  organizations.  Participatory  monitoring  and  evaluation \nsystems  will  be  introduced.  A  database  of  key  benchmark  indicators  will  be  established  by  the \nPMU and become a part of the project monitoring system by 6 months and be routinely updated \nand monitored at least twice a year and in greater detail immediately prior to midterm review and \nproject completion. \n \n\n10. \n\nProject Review \n\nthe  agreed \n\nimplementation  schedule, \n\nimplementation  progress  against \n\n76. \nDuring  the  initial  3  years  of  LBDCIP  implementation,  ADB  will  carry  out  semiannual \nreviews  to  (i)  ensure  that  the  implementation  arrangements  are  in  place  and  appropriate;  (ii) \ngauge \nidentify \nbottlenecks, and in consultation with the Government of Punjab recommend remedial measures \nfor smoother implementation; (iii) ensure that ADB safeguards and other conditions set out in the \nloan  and  project  agreements  are  being  met;  and  (iv)  assess  progress  made  in  mobilizing  and \ntraining  khal  panchayats  and  farmer  organizations  and  the  discharge  of  their  responsibilities. \nTwo years following the effective date, ADB will field a comprehensive midterm review mission \nfor \nidentify  problems  affecting  project \nimplementation, and reach formal agreement with the Government of Punjab on changes on the \nscope or implementation arrangements of the Project required to address these shortfalls. The \nterms  of  reference  of  the  midterm  review  mission  will  be  developed  jointly  by  PIPD  and  ADB \nduring the second and third year of the Project. Prior to the mission, the Government of Punjab \nwill  submit  a  detailed  progress  report.  Project  review  arrangements  for  subsequent  projects \nfinanced under the PIAIP will be similar to those detailed for LBDCIP. \n\nthe  LBDCIP,  which  will  assess  performance, \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\nA. \n\nEconomic Benefits \n\n77. \nEconomic and Financial Benefits. The economic and financial benefits for the LBDCIP \nare  based  on  two  sources.  Nearly  all  the  benefits  come  from  improved  agricultural  production \nfrom increased yields, greater cropping intensity, and some diversification into high-value crops. \nThis is due to the improved water supply from the system R&U. The majority of benefits under \nthe PIAIP are expected to stem from increased agricultural productivity from improved irrigation \nservice  delivery.  The  R&U  will  safely  increase  distribution  capacity  from  a  current  maximum  of \nabout 244 cumecs to 278 cumecs. The economic and financial analyses also reveal that farmers \nat the tail end of canals who have most limited access to canal water and more frequently rely on \nlow-quality groundwater will benefit the most from the Project, which has important productivity \nand equity implications. Crop yields are anticipated to increase from 2% to 7% depending on the \nexisting  deficits  in  crop  water  requirements,  with  cotton,  wheat,  and  sugarcane  seeing  the \nhighest gains. Cropping intensity throughout the LBDCIP area is anticipated to increase by about \n10% to an annual average of 172%, which will be driven by demographic pressures and further \nfarm  fragmentation.  The  Project\u2019s  OFWM  and  agriculture  component  will  help  accelerate \ndiversification to high-value crops within the LBDC command area to supply adjacent markets of \nLahore and Multan. \n \nThe LBDCIP will mitigate the risks and damage from floods from the Balloki Barrage and \n78. \nits associated infrastructure, and from R&U of the LBDC main canal, which has several sections \nprone to breaching. The infrastructure R&U and development will (i) ensure that the water supply \nto the rehabilitated LBDC and the cropping areas supplied by the Balloki\u2013Sulemanki Link Canal \nare  secure,  (ii)  pass  moderate  floods  through  a  new  spillway  reducing  the  need  to  breach \nupstream  levies  and  inundate  adjacent  areas  as  is  the  current  practice,  and  (iii)  construct  two \nbridges  to  facilitate  traffic  flow  during  and  following  flood  events.  R&U  and  development  for \nbarrages and other large infrastructure under the PIAIP are expected to provide similar benefits. \n\n \n\n\fMore than half the 450,000 farms in the LBDC are less than 2 ha; for farmers with less than 1 ha \nin  the  tail  areas,  the  Project  will  yield  an  11%  rise  in  income.  A  total  of  about  275,000  farm \nfamilies or almost 2 million people will benefit from the LBDCIP. The overall Project provides an \neconomic  internal  rate  of  return  of  19.2%  and  a  financial  internal  rate  of  return  of  16.1%.  In \naddition,  the  Project  will  help  stabilize  groundwater  extraction  to  a  sustainable  level,  which  will \nreduce pumping costs to farmers and ensure that this vital resource continues to be available. \n \nB. \n\nSocial and Other Benefits and Impacts \n\nInstitutional Reform and System Sustainability. Although not quantified in the LBDCIP \n77. \nbenefits,  formation  of  farmer  organizations  responsible  for  distributary  and  minor  canals \nsupported  by  IMUs  and  reformed  and  strengthened  management  for  LBDC  with  user \nparticipation  and  better  trained  staff  will  lead  to  the  following:  (i)  greater  responsiveness  of \nservice  to  irrigation  demands,  (ii)  more  efficient  and  equitable  water  distribution,  (iii)  improved \naccountability and transparency, and (iv) improved collection of abiana with higher expenditures \non  system  O&M.  This  will  lead  to  more  sustainable  systems  with  better  performance.  The \nsummary poverty reduction and social strategy is in Appendix 9. \n \n78. \nEnvironmental Impacts. The LBDCIP is an ADB category B project for the environment. \nAs  a  precautionary  measure,  a  full  EIA  was  conducted  according  to  ADB  guidelines.  The \nGovernment of Punjab regulations required a full EIA due to the presence of two protected areas \nand the size of the LBDC command area. The EIA included extensive stakeholder consultation. \nThe findings of the EIA indicate no significant long-term environmental impacts from the LBDCIP; \nrather  it  will  yield  environmental  benefits  due  to  improved  groundwater  management  and \nassociated  conservation  of  groundwater  and  land  resources  (Appendix  10).  Any  negative \nimpacts  are  expected  to  be  temporary,  mainly  associated  with  the  construction  work,  and \nmitigated through the Project. In addition to the full EIA, a summary EIA, two EIAs and summary \nEIAs for the 15-L and Jhandraka subprojects, an environmental assessment framework, and an \nenvironmental  monitoring  plan  with  adequate  funding  have  been  prepared  for  the  Project.  The \ndesign  and supervision contract  for civil  works has  environmental  specialists  included  for  long-\nterm  inputs  to  deal  with  temporary  environmental  impacts  during  construction.  Environmental \ncapacity  development  for  PIPD  will  be  supported  by  having  a  dedicated  unit  with  consultant \nsupport  under  the  director  for  monitoring  and  evaluation  in  the  PMU  for  the  LBDCIP.  All \nsubsequent  tranches  and  their  associated  projects  and  subprojects  under  the  PIAIP  will  be \nassessed  independently  for  environmental  categorization  and  then  be  prepared  in  compliance \nwith  ADB  guidelines  (Schedule  5  of  the  FFA).  The  PIAIP  will  provide  capacity  development \nthrough training, development of procedures, and consultant support as needed for the Strategic \nPlanning Unit that will house the IPPMU. \n \n79. \nResettlement.  Land acquisition and resettlement is expected to be minimal, as in many \ncases the land along the canals is already owned by the Government of Punjab and is unused. \nImpacts on buildings and structures will be minimal and most likely will occur only in proximity to \nthe  bridges  to  be  rebuilt.  The  LBDCIP  appraisal  was  based  on  preparation  of  a  resettlement \nframework  for  the  whole  PIAIP  and  of  resettlement  plans  for  the  two  subprojects  under  the \nLBDCIP:  (i)  the  15-L  distributary  canal  subproject,  representing  the  typical  distributary  canal \nsystem that will be rehabilitated through Project and Program, and (ii) Sahiwal town main canal \nrehabilitation subproject, representing a situation where a relatively densely populated area will \nbe  affected.  Approval  of  civil  works  contract  awards  for  the  15-L  distributary  and  Sahiwal  town \nwill require review and updating of the resettlement plans based on detailed design. In addition, \nresettlement plans will be prepared for (i) the main canal based on three contract packages, (ii) \nBalloki  Barrage,  and  (iii)  the  remaining  distribution  network  based  on  the  award  of  three  large \ncontract packages with each consisting of approximately four plans (12 plans, based on detailed \n\n24 \n\n \n\n\f25 \n\ndesign)  and  two  individual  packages  including  one  for  15-L  and  Jandraka  canals.  Notice  to \nproceed for all other subprojects of the LBDCIP and under the PIAIP will be conditional on the \npreparation  and  approval  of  resettlement  plans.  Affected  people  will  be  provided  with  certain \nresettlement entitlements such as land and asset compensation and transfer allowances, prior to \ntheir  displacement,  dispossession,  or  restricted  access.  Appraisal  of  the  successive  PFRs  will \nrequire  a  review  of  the  resettlement  framework  and  preparation  of  resettlement  plans  for  all \nprojects and subprojects with land acquisition and resettlement issues to be presented for ADB \napproval  with  submission  of  the  PFR.  The  resettlement  framework  details  compensation \nprovisions, and land acquisition and resettlement preparation/implementation procedures for the \nwhole  MFF.  The  LBDCIP\u2019s  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  impacts  are  detailed  in  Appendix \n11. The resettlement framework is attached as annexes to the FFA and the resettlement plans \nfor 15-L and Sahiwal town are included in Supplementary Appendix D. \n \n80. \npopulation fitting the ADB definition of indigenous peoples. \n \nC. \n\nIndigenous  Peoples.  No  impacts  on  indigenous  peoples  are  expected.  Punjab  has  no \n\nRisks \n\n81. \nCommitment  to  Reform.  The  Government  of  Punjab  has  shown  its  commitment  to \nreform  through  development  of  the  PISRP  and  active  support  for  the  World  Bank\u2019s  Punjab \nIrrigation  Sector  Development  Policy  loan.  The  Government  of  Punjab  has  undertaken  action \nthrough  the  establishment  of  farmer  organizations  and  AWBs  and  is  committed  to  continue \ndecentralized  management.  The  MFF  facility  ensures  long-term  engagement  by  ADB  with \nmultiple projects to sustain the reform process. \n \nRobust  Farmer  Organizations.  Development  of  effective  farmer  organizations  to \n82. \nsupport sustainable O&M is a key project outcome. A risk exists that farmer organizations may \nnot be developed or sustainable. The experience in LCC East has shown (i) a strong demand of \nfarmer  organization  formation  by  farmers,  (ii)  improved  collection  rates  of  abiana,  and  (iii) \neffective  O&M  being  undertaken  by  farmers\u2019  own  initiatives.  To  ensure  effective  farmer \norganizations,  the  Project  will  support  (i)  intensive  and  ongoing  training,  (ii)  facilities  and \nequipment  to  establish  farmer  organization  capacity,  (iii)  IMUs  to  ensure  requisite  technical \nguidance  for  O&M,  and  (iv)  adequate  allocation  of  the  abiana  share  to  ensure  financial \nsustainability.  \n \n83. \nPIAIP  Utilization. A risk exists that program funds will not be fully or effectively utilized. \nThe  Program  provides  for  (i)  establishment  of  a  dedicated  IPPMU  within  the  PIPD  Strategic \nPlanning  Cell,  (ii)  $10  million  in  ADF  support  along  with  consultant  terms  of  reference  to \nestablish the PIAPPF to prepare subsequent projects, and (iii) a dedicated PMU for each project; \nin addition the MFF modality allows PIPD staff to gain experience and lessons from past projects \nso  implementation  will  improve.  PIPD  has  substantial  positive  experience  with  aid-funded \nprojects. \n \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n84. \nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances  and  to  the  assurances  included  in  the  FFA,  the \nGovernment and the Government of Punjab have given the following assurances, which will be \nincorporated,  as  appropriate  in  the  legal  documents  for  individual  projects  financed  under  the \nMFF. \n \nthat  necessary \n85. \ncounterpart  funds  are  available  and  released  on  a  timely  basis  to  implement  the  PIAIP  and \nrelated projects it finances. The Government  of Punjab will annually update its irrigation sector \n\nCounterpart  Funding.  The  Government  of  Punjab  will  ensure \n\n \n\n\f26 \n\ndevelopment  program  to  incorporate  revised  estimates  of  the  funding  requirements  for  the \nprojects/subprojects under the PIAIP.  \n \n86. \nPolicy  Dialogue. The Government of Punjab will keep ADB informed of, and exchange \nviews  on,  sector  issues,  policy  reform  discussions  with  other  multilateral  or  bilateral  agencies \nthat may have implications for implementation of the PIAIP, and progress on institutional reforms \nand  will  provide  ADB  with  an  opportunity  to  comment  on  any  resulting  policy  proposals.  The \nGovernment  of  Punjab  will  submit  to  ADB  its  annually  updated  irrigation  sector  development \nprogram. \n \n87. \nO&M.  The  Government  of  Punjab  will  ensure  that  adequate  funds  are  allocated  in  its \nannual budgets and made available throughout the PIAIP period for the O&M of irrigation assets \nuntil such time that AWBs become financially self-sustaining. \n \n88. \nAbiana.  The  Government  of  Punjab  will  cause  PIPD  and  farmer  organizations  to \nestablish  adequate  procedures  for  assessing  and  auditing  the  collection  of  abiana.  The \nGovernment  of  Punjab  will  ensure  that,  by  year  3  of  LBDCIP  implementation,  a  clear  cost-\nsharing  arrangement  is  established  by  PIPD  and  adopted  for  the  LBDC  based  on  a  detailed \nfinancial analysis of the actual O&M requirements for farmer organizations. \n \n89. \nSafeguards.  The  Government  of  Punjab  will  ensure  that  (i)  all  projects  financed  under \nthe  Program  are  carried  out  in  full  compliance  with  all  applicable  laws  and  regulations  of  the \nGovernment  and  the  Government  of  Punjab,  and  ADB\u2019s  safeguard  policies,  including  the \npolicies  on  involuntary  resettlement 42 and  the  environment; 43 (ii)  the  safeguard  frameworks \nagreed on and set forth in Schedule 5 to the FFA, which are to be reviewed and, if necessary, \nupdated  by  each  new  tranche/loan  appraisal,  and  (iii)  respective  resettlement  plans,  initial \nenvironmental  assessment  reports,  and  environmental  management  plans  included  therein, \nprepared for each project or subproject under the MFF that must be selected in accordance with \ncriteria agreed on and set forth in Schedule 4 to the FFA.  \n \n90.  With  regard  to  the  LBDCIP,  the  Government  of  Punjab  will  update  each  resettlement \nplans prepared for (i) the 15-L distributary canal subproject; and (ii) the Sahiwal Town main canal \nsystem  upon  completion  of  detailed  technical  design,  and  submit  those  to  ADB  for  review  and \napproval.  The  updated  resettlement  plans  will  be  disclosed  to  affected  people.  No  civil  works \ncontract will be awarded under the subproject until ADB has approved the updated resettlement \nplan  for  15-L  distributary  or  Sahiwal  town.  In  addition,  the  Government  of  Punjab  will  prepare \nresettlement plans based on the resettlement framework for all remaining subprojects within the \nLBDCIP: (i) the main canal subproject that is based on three contract packages, (ii) the Balloki \nBarrage  and  associated  works,  and  (iii)  the  remaining  distribution  network  based  on  three \ncontract  packages  with  multiple  subprojects.  The  Government  of  Punjab  will  ensure  that \nresettlement plans (i) are based upon detailed design and detailed measurement survey of the \nsubprojects; (ii) include complete information on full census, final asset inventory and valuation, \nand final budget; (iii) are made available to the affected people in draft and final forms, including \ninformation  on  measurement  of  losses,  detailed  asset  valuation,  entitlements  and  special \nprovisions,  grievance  procedures,  timing  for  payment  and  displacement  schedule;  and  (iv)  are \nsubmitted to review and approval by ADB. No notice to proceed will be given to the civil works \ncontractors  for  any  section  or  part  of  the  subproject  until  ADB  has  approved  the  respective \nresettlement plan. \n \n\n                                                 \n42  ADB. 1995.

Manila. \n\n \n\n\f27 \n\nFor  future  projects  to  be  financed  under  subsequent  individual  tranches/loans,  the \n91. \nGovernment  of  Punjab  will  ensure  that  completed  resettlement  plans  for  all  projects  and \nsubproject  included  under  a  PFR  are  submitted  with  the  PFR  for  approval.  Each  resettlement \nplan is (i) to be prepared based on the detailed design and detailed measurement survey of the \nsubproject, (ii) to include complete information on full census, final asset inventory and valuation, \nand  final  budget;  (iii)  to  be  made  available  to  the  affected  people  in  draft  and  final  forms, \nincluding  information  on  measurement  of  losses,  detailed  asset  valuation,  entitlements  and \nspecial  provisions,  grievance  procedures,  timing  for  payment,  and  displacement  schedule;  and \n(iv) to be approved by ADB prior to notice to proceed for civil works contractors. Affected people \nwill  be  provided  certain  resettlement  entitlements  such  as  land  and  asset  compensation  and \ntransfer allowances, prior to their displacement, dispossession, or restricted access.  \n \nThroughout  the  Program  implementation  period,  the  Government  of  Punjab  will  ensure \n92. \nthat  sufficient  funds  are  made  available  as  and  when  necessary  for  the  efficient  and  timely \nimplementation of resettlement activities.  \n \nAll  subsequent  tranches  and  their  associated  projects  and  subprojects  under  the  PIAIP \n93. \nwill  be  assessed  independently  for  environmental  categorization  and  then  prepared  in \ncompliance with ADB guidelines The Government of Punjab will prepare an initial environmental \nassessment or initial environmental examination, including an environmental management plan \nor  a  full  EIA  as  required  to  be  approved  by  relevant  government  authority.  These  will  be \nsubmitted  to  ADB  for  review  and  approval.  All  civil  works  and  consultant  contracts  under  the \nprojects will contain provisions requiring compliance with the initial environmental assessment or \ninitial environmental examination during project design, construction, and operation. \n \n94. \nExternal  Monitoring.  The  Government  of  Punjab  will  engage  an  external  agency  or  a \nnongovernment organization, acceptable to ADB, to conduct external monitoring and evaluation \nof the resettlement process and impacts. Reports of the independent monitoring agency will be \nsubmitted to ADB on a semiannual basis.  \n \n95. \nFuture  Project  and/or  Subprojects.  Any  changes  to  the  location,  land  alignment  of \nfacilitating  roads,  environmental  or  social  impacts  on  account  of  detailed  designs  of  related \nprojects will be subject to prior approval by the relevant provincial agency of Punjab and ADB, as \nneeded.  \n \n96. \nSocial Aspects. The Government of Punjab will ensure that all civil works contractors (i) \ncomply with all applicable labor laws, (ii) use their best efforts to employ women and local people \nliving  in  the  vicinity  of  the  project/subproject,  (iii)  disseminate  information  at  worksites  on  the \nrisks of sexually transmitted diseases and HIV/AIDS for those employed during construction, and \n(iv)  are  required  not  to  differentiate  between  men  and  women\u2019s  wages  or  benefits  for  work  of \nequal value, and use child labor. Contracts for all projects to be financed under the PIAIP must \ninclude specific clauses on these undertakings, and compliance will be strictly monitored. \n \n97. \nGood  Governance  and  Anticorruption. The Government of Punjab will ensure that (i) \nrelevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) are included in all \nbidding documents for the Project, and (ii) all contracts financed by ADB in connection with the \nprojects/subproject  financed  under  the  MFF  include  provisions  specifying  the  right  of  ADB  to \naudit  and  examine  the  records  and  accounts  of  DOFWM;  farmer  organizations;  PIDA;  PMO-\nbarrages; PIPD; and all contractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service providers as they \nrelate  to  the  Project.  All  procurement  activities  will  be  subject  to  an  independent  performance \naudit by an independent auditor appointed by the Government of Punjab and acceptable to ADB. \nThe performance audit will be performed at least twice during PIAIP implementation. The auditor \nwill  also  perform  random  or  spot  checks  for  contract  implementation  activities  under  each \n\n \n\n\fproject/subproject\u2019s  contracts.  All  external  costs  related  to  such  investigations  will  be  borne  by \nthe  applicable  project/subproject.  Punjab  will  ensure  that  PIPD  establishes  a  website  for  the \nPIAIP that will present financial statements and track procurement contract awards, and include \ninformation on, among others, the list of participating bidders, name of the winning bidder, basic \ndetails on bidding procedures adopted, amount of the contract awarded, the list of goods and/or \nservices purchased, and their intended and actual utilization.  \n \n\n1. \n\nSpecific Assurances for Farmer Organizations \n\n98. \nPunjab shall ensure that (i) all vehicles and equipment procured under the Project for the \nuse of PIDA and DOFWM remain with IMUs or farmer organizations following the completion of \nthe  work  by  PIDA  or  DOFWM;  (ii)  farmer  organizations  and  IMUs  are  provided  with  adequate \noffices  at  no  cost  to  the  farmer  organizations  or  IMUs  throughout  project  implementation  and \nthereafter; (iii) accounts and related financial statements of each farmer organization established \nunder the Project are properly audited; and, (iv) external monitoring and evaluation for the entire \nfarmer  organization  program,  including  mobilization  and  training  by  PIDA,  is  carried  out  during \nproject implementation. \n \n99. \nPunjab shall also ensure that the following farmer organization participation takes place: \n(i)  civil  works  will  be  identified  and proposed  by farmer  organizations on  the  basis  of  a  system \nwalk-through with PMU consultant staff; (ii) PMU consultants will carry out surveys and design in \nconsultation  with  the  farmer  organizations;  and  (iii)  farmer  organizations  will  be  part  of  a  PMU \nstaff  and  PIPD  committee  that  will  facilitate  dialogue,  feedback,  and  if  necessary  actions  to \naddress the concerns of the farmer organization with the R&U. The walk-through will be used to \nidentify small-scale civil works that are within the farmer organization\u2019s capacity to execute under \ncommunity  contracting  with  appropriate  supervision.  These  farmer  organization  works  will  be \nincluded  in  the  larger  civil  works  contracts  for  the  distributary  and  minor  canals.  Farmer \norganization  participation  procedures  will  be  refined  in  the  two  project  preparatory  technical \nassistance  subprojects,  15-L  and  Jhandraka.  Punjab  will  ensure  that  a  pilot  trial  for  full  farmer \norganization  management  of  civil  works  in  a  small  and  technically  appropriate  minor  or \ndistributary canal undergoing R&U later in the Project. The farmer organization participation will \ninclude design, tender, contract award and supervisions, and financial management; and will be \nsupported by the PMU. \n \n\n2. \n\nSpecific Assurances for the LBDC Circle and AWB \n\n100.  Punjab  shall  ensure  that  LBDC  Circle  of  PIPD  reports  directly  to  the  PMU  throughout \nproject implementation. Punjab shall, by 30 June 2011, develop and adopt a rationalized staffing \nplan and personnel procedures for LBDC, based on an operations modernization strategy to be \ndeveloped under the Project.   \n \n101.  Punjab  shall  ensure  that  by  30  June  2009  (i)  adequate  procedures  are  established  for \nassessing  and  auditing  the  collection  of  abiana,  (ii)  financial  analyses  are  undertaken  to \ndetermine the cost of adequate O&M at all levels of LBDC system management, and (iii) clear \nand equitable cost-sharing arrangements are established by PIPD so that farmer organizations \neither (a) retain a share of abiana adequate to cover O&M costs, or (b) receive adequate funds \nfrom the provincial budget to sustain O&M costs until abiana is adjusted to cover these costs. \n \n102.  Punjab shall ensure that, prior to submission of the next PFR, a time-bound action plan \nfor  changing  the  LBDC  management  to  a  decentralized  AWB  management  structure  with \nfarmers representation is agreed with ADB.  \n \n\n28 \n\n \n\n\f29 \n\n3. \n\nSpecific Assurances for the Water Sector Institutional Framework \n\n103.  Punjab shall ensure that it will (i) by no later than 30 April 2007, develop a framework for \nstakeholders  discussions  for  assessing,  among  others:  (a)  resource  management  for  surface \nand groundwater, (b) irrigation and drainage service delivery, (c) flood control, (d) water quality, \n(e) hydropower, and (f) water supply and sanitation; (ii) by no later than 30 June 2009, develop a \ntime-bound  sector  road  map  based  on  the  stakeholders  discussions;  (iii)  by  no  later  than  31 \nDecember  2008,  adopt  the  revised  rules  for  farmer  organizations  and  AWB,  and  a  model \nirrigation management transfer agreement developed under the Project; and (iv) by no later than \n31 December 2008, submit to the Provincial Assembly for consideration legislation on a source \nof  independent  legal  authority  and  establishment  of  farmer  organizations  independent  of  the \nPunjab Irrigation and Drainage Authority Act dated 2 July 1997. \n \n\nVI. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n104. \nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  multitranche  financing  facility  would  comply  with  the \nArticles  of  Agreement  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board \napprove the provision of loans under the multitranche financing facility in an aggregate principal \namount  not  exceeding  $900,000,000  equivalent  to  the  Islamic  Republic  of  Pakistan  for  the \nPunjab Irrigated Agriculture Investment Program comprising   \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nthe  loans  not  exceeding  $890,000,000  equivalent  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital \nresources, with interest to be determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank \noffered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; and  \nthe  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to  $10,000,000  in  Special  Drawing  Rights \nfrom  ADB  Special  Fund  resources,  with  an  interest  charge  at  the  rate  of  1.0%  per \nannum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter; a term of 32 years, \nincluding a grace period of 8 years;  \n\n \nand such other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in \nthe Framework Financing Agreement presented to the Board. \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n20 November 2006 \n\n \n   \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\fSri DESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n\n30 \n\nAppendix 1 \n\nDesign Summary \n\nImpact \n \nEconomic growth in \nProgram areas of Punjab. \n \n \nConservation of water and \nland resources. \n\nOutcome \n \nThe sustainable improved \ndelivery of services for \nirrigated agriculture and \nbetter water management \nin Punjab. \n \n\nPerformance \nTargets/Indicators \n\n \n \nIncreased incomes and \npoverty reduced in project \nareas supported by \nProgram.

It  is  heavily  dependent  on  an  average  annual  inflow  to  the  Indus \nRiver  system  (including  the  mainstream  Indus  and  the  five  Punjab  tributaries:  the  Beas, \nChenab, Jhelum, Ravi, and Sutlej rivers) of about 180 billion cubic meters of water. This runoff, \nfor the most part, originates in neighboring countries and is largely a result of snowmelt in the \nHimalayas  coupled  with  summer  monsoon  rains.  Large-scale  irrigation  emerged  in  the  19th \ncentury  and  following  intensive  development  during  the  British  period,  the  Indus  irrigation \nsystem  became  the  largest  contiguous  irrigation  system  in  the  world.  Following  partition, \nPakistan and India negotiated the Indus Waters Treaty (signed in 1960) giving Pakistan rights to \nthe waters of the Chenab, Indus, and Jhelum rivers, which represented about 75% of the flow of \nthe Indus system as a whole.  \n \nA  number  of  challenges,  including  the  critical  need  for  storage,  interbasin  transfer  of \n2. \nwater,  and  water-logging  and  salinity,  have  been  met  with  varying  degrees  of  success  since \nsigning of the accord, and irrigated agriculture remains a major part of the Pakistan economy. \nThe country has about 17 million hectares (ha) of irrigated cropland; the vast majority is served \nby  the  Indus  basin  system.  However,  agriculture\u2019s  role  as  a  major  contributor  to  Pakistan\u2019s \neconomy is declining modestly as other sectors develop. In 1985 agriculture represented 29% \nof Pakistan\u2019s gross domestic product; this declined to 26% in 1985 and was only 21% in 2005. \nSector  growth  slowed  significantly  in  the  late  1990s,  registering  only  2.7%  during  1995\u20132005, \njust over half of the 4.1% growth rate recorded from 1985 to 1995. However, 2005 growth was \n7.5%, indicating that recovery from the growth slump has commenced. \n \n3. \nWater is the critical factor both for the economy and agriculture. About 80% of the arable \nland and 90% of the agricultural output are entirely dependent on irrigation; irrigation uses about \n95%  of  the  country\u2019s  water  resources.  Accordingly,  irrigated  agriculture  is  a  vital  sector  and \neffective management of irrigation represents the most important critical challenge of integrated \nwater  resource  management.  Pakistan  faces  a  number  of  serious  water  resource  issues  that \nhave  serious  economic  and  environmental  implications,  including  (i)  rapidly  declining  water \navailability  per  capita  as  a  result  of  increasing  population  and  declining  storage  capacity  as  a \nresult of reservoir sedimentation; (ii) mistrust and lack of consensus among the provinces on the \nprovision  of  additional  storage  on  the  Indus  to  both  replace  storage  lost  and  add  additional \nstorage  to  meet  increasing  demands; 1  (iii)  overexploitation  and  deteriorating  quality  of \ngroundwater  caused  by  the  recent  drought  (2000\u20132005),  undependable  and  inequitable  canal \nwater  delivery,  and  increasing  pollution;  (iv)  deteriorating,  unreliable,  and  inefficient  irrigation \ninfrastructure resulting from aging improper asset management, and inadequate operation and \nmaintenance; (v) poor governance, transparency, and accountability of irrigation service delivery \nlargely  due  to  the  absence  of  user  participation  in  system  management;  (vi)  low  water-use \nefficiency  and  agricultural  production;  and  (vii)  seawater  intrusion  and  serious  environmental \ndegradation of the Indus delta and adjoining coastal areas from inadequate water releases from \nenvironmental flows. \n \n\n                                                 \n1   Pakistan  has  a  long  tradition  of  water  entitlements,  and  the  1991  Inter-provincial  Water  Accord  establishes  clear \nentitlements  for  each  province.  Implicit  in  the  accord,  is  a  set  of  water  entitlements  at  the  canal  command  level. \nRules  are  also  well-established  for  distributing  water  to  distributary  canals  although  implementation  by  system \nmanagers of these provisions is weak. At the outlets, farmers practice well-established rotational schedules. \n\n \n\n\f34 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nAgriculture in Punjab \n\nB. \n \n4. \nAgriculture  is  the  mainstay  of  Punjab\u2019s  economy.  Given  Punjab\u2019s  size,  Punjab\u2019s \neconomic  indicators  to  a  large  degree  drive  the  same  indicators  for  Pakistan.  However, \ncomposition  of  the  indicators  differs.  Agriculture\u2019s  role  in  the  overall  economy  is  marginally \nhigher  in  Punjab  than  in  the  country  as  a  whole,  accounting  for  about  26%  of  the  provincial \ngross domestic product (GDP) and providing direct employment to more than 50% of the labor \nforce. \n \n5. \nPerformance of agriculture in Punjab has been strong over the past 20 years, growing at \naround 4%\u20135% per annum. Since the 1960s, agricultural growth in Punjab has resulted largely \nfrom the adoption of improved inputs including high-yielding varieties, fertilizer, and pesticides, \ncoupled with an increased supply of irrigation water.2 Recently, however, agricultural appears to \nbe  decelerating.  For  the  past  30  years  the  productivity  of  the  water  used  in  agriculture  (i.e., \nproduction per unit volume of water used) has been slowly declining as a result of water-logging \nand  salinity,  as  well  as  the  deteriorating  quality  of  groundwater  sources.  The  recently  noted \ndecline  in  agricultural  growth  may  well  be  attributable  to  the  fact  that  water  availability,  both \nsurface  and  groundwater,  is  increasingly  becoming  a  limiting  factor. 3 Given  the  position  of \nirrigated agriculture as the driving force in the provincial economy, a reasonable growth in the \nsector  is  essential  to  sustain  overall  economic  growth  and  performance.  This  will  require  (i) \ninvestment  targeted  at  rehabilitating  and  upgrading  irrigation  infrastructure;  (ii)  systematic \nregulation and management of groundwater resources; and (iii) establishment and development \nof institutions responsible for improving the efficiency and reliability of irrigation service delivery, \nand ensuring equitable sharing of irrigation supplies. \n \nC. \n\nIrrigated Agriculture in Punjab \n\n \n\n6. \nIrrigated  agriculture  is  crucial  for  Punjab.  The  province  accounts  for  80%  of  Pakistan\u2019s \nagricultural production, and over 90% of Punjab\u2019s agricultural production is derived from the 8.4 \nmillion  ha  of  irrigated  land  served  by  Punjab\u2019s  irrigation  and  drainage  system.  Irrigated \nagriculture uses over 95% of the water resources. Punjab provides about 58% of the country\u2019s \nGDP  and  Punjab\u2019s  agricultural  GDP  represents  66%  of  the  national  agricultural  GDP.  The \nirrigated  agriculture  sector  is  crucial  to  any  strategy  for  generating  additional  employment, \nincreasing incomes, and attaining the targeted 6%\u20137% annual growth rate for Punjab.4 \n \n7. \nMore  than  half  of  Pakistan\u2019s  irrigated  land  lies  in  Punjab  and  the  associated  irrigation \ninfrastructure is managed and operated by the province.5 Irrigated agriculture in Punjab covers a \ncultivable command area of 8.41 million ha with a provincial irrigated cropping intensity of about \n122%. Much of the extensive irrigation infrastructure was initially developed under the British; a \nlater period of significant development occurred under the Indus Basin Project during the 1960s. \nThis  infrastructure  base  provides  the  foundation  for  irrigated  agriculture  in  Punjab  (Table  A2). \nThe  total  estimated  value  of  the  irrigation  and  water  resource  management  infrastructure  in \n                                                 \n2   The increased irrigation supplies have resulted from the exponential growth of tubewells throughout Punjab within \nthe past decade. Exemplifying this growth is the Lower Bari Doab Canal (LBDC) command  where the number of \nirrigation tubewells increased from 19,960 in 1994 to more than 48,000 in 2005. This relates to an increase in the \nabstraction of groundwater of 1,964 million cubic meters over 10 years suggesting an annual increase of about 200 \nmillion cubic meters. \n\n3   The decline in agricultural growth over the past 4 years corresponds with a period of extreme drought.  \n4   ADB,  Department  for  International  Development,  Government  of  the  Punjab,  and  World  Bank.  2005.

As  a \nresult, the full potential of irrigated agriculture contribution to economic growth and employment \nis not being achieved.  \n \n9. \nPopulation  growth  and  farm  fragmentation  have  resulted  in  significantly  increased \ncropping intensities driving irrigation water demand far beyond the original design capacity. The \nsystems  were  designed  for  low  cropping  intensities  of  60%\u201380%  with  assumed  fallow  land. \nAnnual cropping intensity in Punjab is 122%, and in more productive systems such as the LBDC \nit averages about 160%, reaching 200% in some areas. This has led to increasing water supply \nshortfalls that are exacerbated during drought and because Pakistan has lost nearly 30% in its \neffective Indus Basin water storage due to reservoir sedimentation. \n \n10. \nAll  irrigation  and  water  resource  management  infrastructure  has  deteriorated  over  time \ndue  to  a  combination  of  age  and  lack  of  adequate  maintenance. 7  In  certain  cases,  the \ndilapidated state of a few major structures is dangerous in view of the physical risk to the well-\nbeing  of  downstream  residents.  For  the  most  part,  the  poor  condition  of  the  canals  simply \nmeans  that  the  infrastructure  does  not  provide  reliable  service  delivery,  and  farmers  have  to \nadapt to unreliable, substandard delivery of irrigation water. \n \n11. \nPoor irrigation service delivery by the public sector, which is characterized by unreliable \nand  inequitable  irrigation  deliveries,  low  accountability,  absence  of  water-user  participation  in \n\n                                                 \n6   This  does  not  include  the  storage  facilities  of  Chasma,  Mangla,  and  Tarbela  dams,  watercourses,  or  private \n\ninvestment in tubewells. \n\n7   The  accumulated  deferred  maintenance  is  estimated  to  be  about  $2.0  billion,  the  requirement  for  deferred \n\nmaintenance plus justifiable upgrading about $3.5 billion. \n\n \n\n\f36 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nsystem  management,  and  lack  of  communication  with  farmers  contributes  significantly  to \nsuboptimal  utilization  of  water  resources. 8  Low  O&M  cost  recovery  is  a  reflection  of  user \ndissatisfaction  with  irrigation  service  delivery.  Abiana  (irrigation  service  fee)  proceeds  are \ncollected  by  the  district  revenue  department  and  subsequently  become  a  part  of  provincial \nrevenues and resources, rather than being retained and used for O&M in the command areas \nwhere they are collected. Consequently, farmers correctly conclude that there is no relationship \nbetween the revenue generated and allocation of funds for O&M on a given canal. \n \nPIPD  has  grown  over  time  and  failed  to  put  into  place  the  required  conditions  of \n12. \naccountability  and  transparency  that  guarantee efficiency.  PIPD  has  about  50,000 employees, \ncosting 65% of the annual O&M budget, leaving only 35% for maintenance. The organizational \nstructure, skill mix, assignment of responsibility, and institutional culture remain unchanged from \nthe  British  period,  and  the  once  good  institutional  discipline  has  largely  broken  down.  Staff \nsalaries  are  well  below  those  in  the  private  sector.  Lack  of  transparency  in  water  allocation,9 \nmeasurement, 10 and  delivery  result  in  uncertainties  and  inequities  in  water  distribution  and \nopportunities for rent seeking. Farmers comprehend the natural variability of their water supply, \nbut want to know what their share is and when it will be delivered. Having this information, they \nare  better  equipped  to  make  informed  and  lower  risk  decisions  on  how  best  to  use  both  the \nwater and their land.  \n \nAs  a  result  of  unreliable  surface  water  supply,  the  explosive  growth  in  the  number  of \n13. \ntubewells in Punjab has led to overexploitation of groundwater resources with resulting drops in \nwater  tables  signifying  mining  of  groundwater.11 The  rapid  increase  in  volume  of  groundwater \npumped  partly  reflects  the  unreliability  of  canal  water  deliveries,  which  forces  farmers  to \nincreasingly rely on groundwater, particularly in the tail reaches of the canal system. As water \ntables  decline  increasing  regional  groundwater  inflows,  a  rapid  deterioration  in  groundwater \nquality often accompanies the declining aquifers.12 In many cases, the indiscriminate use of low-\nquality  groundwater  is  leading  to  an  increasing  expanse  of  cultivable  command  within  Punjab \nthat  suffers  from  secondary  soil  salinity  or  is  becoming  sodium  affected.  Consequently  crop \nyields in the affected areas are quite low. \n \nE. \n \n14. \nInstitutional  reforms  in  the  water  sector  in  Punjab  were  initiated  under  the  National \nDrainage  Program  (NDP),  which  was  supported  by  ADB,  Japan  Bank  for  International \nCooperation,  and  World  Bank.13 The  initial  results  were  modest  with  respect  to  Punjab;  little \n                                                 \n8   Rent  seeking  by  public  sector  operating  entities,  water  theft  by  upstream  farmers,  and  the  poor  condition  of  the \ncanal system all contribute to tail-end farmers rarely receiving irrigation deliveries from the system and invariably \nnot receiving their fair share of water. \n\nGovernment of Punjab Actions to Address Sector Problems \n\n9   Pakistan\u2019s 1991 interprovincial Water Apportion Accord lays out provincial entitlements. However, administration of \nintraprovincial  water  entitlement  needs  to  be  much  more  transparent.  Farmers  get  little  information  on  water \navailability in the system, amounts supplied, and/or the reliability of future delivery. \n\n10  Most canal systems are not equipped with calibrated water measuring devices. \n11  Mining  occurs  when  pumping  exceeds  recharge  and  regional  inflow  (sustainable  yield)  and  groundwater  is \npermanently  removed  from  storage  within  the  aquifer.  Water  balance  studies  conducted  on  the  LBDC  command \nindicate that 411 million cubic meters are being mined annually resulting in a water table decline of 0.37 meters per \nyear. \n\n12  The origins of the aquifer system largely dictate the distribution of groundwater quality. Geologically, the subsiding \ndepositional basin retained brackish water at depth. Adjacent to rivers, which constantly adjusted their courses, the \ndeposits  were  continually  flushed  by  fresh  water,  displacing  the  original  more  brackish  depositional  waters.  As  a \nresult, groundwater near the rivers is generally less saline than that in adjacent areas. \n\n13  To support the reforms in the NDP, the Punjab Irrigation and Drainage Authority (PIDA) Bill was passed on 27 June \n1997 that (i) established PIDA as separate entity from PIPD for decentralized irrigation management and gave all \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 2       37   \n\n \n\nprogress  was  made  with  the  reform  agenda.  This  situation  has  changed  dramatically  as  a \nreform-minded  leadership  has  emerged  that  targeted  water  sector  issues  among  Punjab\u2019s  top \ndevelopment priorities. In 2005, the chief minister appointed a senior committee headed by the \nchairman  of  the  Planning  and  Development  Board  with  members  from  key  provincial \ndepartments including finance, agriculture, environment, and PIPD, to oversee the development \nof the Irrigation Sector Reform Program and an action plan. \n \n15. \nThe  Irrigation  Sector  Reform  Program  supports  the  broader  multisector  provincial \nstrategy  that  emphasizes  (i)  improving  governance  by  enhancing  the  accountability  of  state \ninstitutions,  (ii)  improving  social  service  delivery  systems,  (iii)  accelerating  growth  and \ngenerating  employment  through  focus  on  productive  sectors,  and  (iv)  enhancing  the \neffectiveness  of  public  sector  expenditures  through  budgetary  and  institutional  reforms.  The \nprogram is being implemented in conjunction with the recently approved Punjab Irrigation Sector \nDevelopment  Policy  loan,14 a  program-type  loan  with  an  associated  policy  matrix  for  sector \nreform that corresponds to the Irrigation Sector Reform Program and its four interrelated pillars. \n \nPillar I: Institutional and Policy Reforms to Improve Management and Maintenance \n16. \nof  the  Irrigation  System.  The  objective  is  to  ensure  long-term  physical  and  financial \nsustainability of Punjab\u2019s irrigation system. A multipronged strategy is provided with short- and \nmedium-term measures for (i) improving asset management, progressively reducing the backlog \nof deferred maintenance; (ii) reducing operating and administrative costs; (iii) rationalizing and \nimproving  recovery  of  abiana  through  a  new  system  of  inflation  adjustments  and  user \nparticipation in assessment and collection; (iv) introducing a transparent policy for maintenance \nand  repair  cost  sharing  (i.e.,  government  plus  user  charges);  and  (v)  developing  institutional \ncapacity for efficient O&M with improved attention to social and environmental considerations. \n \n17. \nPillar  II:  Water  Resource  Management  Reforms.  The  objective  is  to  emphasize  the \nimportance  of  water  entitlements,  measurements,  and  transparency;  and  build  on  Punjab\u2019s \nexisting  platform  of  water  entitlements, 15  to  make  intraprovincial  water  allocations  and \ndistribution more transparent, and to extend the system of entitlements to groundwater. These \nreforms  would  serve  to  enhance  farmer  confidence,  reduce  uncertainties  associated  with \nirrigation  deliveries,  and  help  increase  agricultural  productivity.  Over  the  longer  term,  the \nopportunity cost for water would become more transparent and provide incentives for allocation \nof water to uses resulting in higher return, through a market mechanism. As a first step in this \ndirection, PIPD is taking actions to ensure reliable water measurement, and is publicizing water \nentitlements  and  actual  diversions  at  the  main  canal  level. 16  PIPD  has  also  initiated \ndevelopment  of  a  strategy  to  help  ensure  the  sustainable  use  of  groundwater,  among  others, \nthrough improved monitoring, information dissemination, and farmer participation; the drafting of \nthe strategy or its implementation has not yet commenced. \n \n\n                                                                                                                                                          \nresponsibility and assets to PIDA for irrigation service delivery, and (ii) provided a legal framework to establish (a) \nfarmers  organizations  to  manage  the  distributary  and  minor  canals,  and  collect  and  retain  a  share  of  abiana  for \nO&M, and (b) area water boards to direct management of irrigation systems at the main canal level and that would \nbe governed by a board of directors with a majority of farmer members. \n\n14  The  loan  was  approved  1  June  2006  for  $100  million.  It  is  the  first  of  three  tranches  that  will  be  processed  as \n\nindividual loans with the next loan anticipated for approval in 2007. The loan provides budget support.  \n\n15  Implicit in the 1991 Inter-provincial Water Accord is a set of water entitlements at the canal command level beyond \nprovincial allocations. It provides well-established rules for distributing water to the distributaries and outlets. Below \nthe outlets, the warabandi (farmer rotation) is a proxy to a water right, through which a farmer has a right to time of \ndelivery.  The  administration  of  intraprovincial  water  entitlements  needs  to  be  made  more  transparent  and \nimplemented in a participatory manner. \n\n16  Gradually these arrangements will be instituted for distributary canals and ultimately for individual users. \n\n \n\n\f38 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nPillar III: Irrigation Service Delivery Reforms. The objective is to improve the quality, \n18. \nefficiency, and accountability with which irrigation services are delivered. Irrigation institutions in \nPakistan  have  not  yet  made  the  transition  from  the  era  of  development  and  construction  to \nmanagement  of  assets;  service  delivery  is  the  primary  objective.17 This  challenge  will  be  met \nthrough a combination of organizational changes and introduction of incentives. Essentially, this \nwould  involve  (i)  decentralization  of  management  and  O&M  of  the  system;  (ii)  entry  of  new \nparticipants,  including  farmer  organizations,  in  the  management  and  distribution  of  water;  and \n(iii) the use of contracts that specify the rights and obligations of water providers and users.  \n \n19. \nPillar  IV:  On-Farm  Agricultural  Water  Management  Reforms.  Full  benefits  of  the \ninitial three sets of sector reform can only be realized if irrigation application efficiency at farms \nis improved and productivity increases. The objective of these reforms is to improve water use \nefficiency  and  on-farm  productivity  through  the  introduction  of  changes  in  field  irrigation \ninfrastructure, agronomic practices, irrigation technology, and institutional structure conducive to \na  sustainable,  efficient,  and  more  demand-responsive  irrigation.  The  Punjab  provincial \ngovernment is simultaneously addressing these through (i) clearly defined agricultural policies, \nand  (ii)  an  effective  applied  agricultural  research  program  that  will  generate  appropriate  water \nmanagement technology and improved agronomic practice. \n \n20. \nin  the  Field.  The  Punjab  provincial  government  is  moving  forward \naggressively with on-the-ground action in relation to Pillar III and establishment of decentralized \nmanagement  through  implementation  of  the  reforms  related  to  the  NDP.  Since  2003,  in  the \nLower Chenab Canal East, 83 farmer organizations have been formed and an area water board \n(AWB)  established  as  part  of  an  irrigation  rehabilitation  project  financed  under  the  NDP  by \nJapan Bank for International Cooperation.18 PIPD has also committed to establishing 100 more \nfarmer organizations and two additional AWBs under the Punjab Irrigation Sector Development \nPolicy  loan.  Notification  to  form  farmer  organizations  and  establish  an  AWB  in  the  LBDC  was \ngiven on 11 July 2006, specifying the PIPD superintending engineer for the LBDC Circle as its \nchief  executive  officer.  Initially,  the  AWB  will  serve  an  advisory  function.  As  of  2006,  the \nexperience of the farmer organizations in LCC has been positive with financial sustainability and \nmuch improved O&M. All these elements support a substantial, sustained long-term investment \nprogram with linked reforms in irrigated agriculture to support continued economic growth. \n \n\nProgress \n\n                                                 \n17  Initiating the transition to a modern irrigation service delivery structure was one of the major objectives of the NDP. \nWhile  achievements  under  the  NDP  were  modest,  a  number  of  lessons  were  learned  such  as  focusing  on  a \nmanageable  number  of  key  objectives  and  encouraging  experimentation  with  different  models  for  institutional \nreform. The institutional reform objectives of the NDP remain valid. \n\n18  The LCC East project is financed by JBIC and the project was initiated using NDP funds during the latter stages of \nthe NDP in 2002 with the condition of farmer organizations being formed as a requirement for civil works. Since this \ntime, JBIC has started the LCC West project under separate funding; work started in 2006. \n\n \n\n\fEXTERNAL ASSISTANCE TO THE SECTOR \n \nTable A3.1: Asian Development Bank Lending to the Water Sector \n\nProject \n\nDate Approved \n\nPunjab Community Water Supply and Sanitation Sector \n\nPunjab Rural Water Supply and Sanitation (Sector) \nThird Punjab On-Farm Water Management \n\n800-PAK \n1679-PAK  Punjab Farmer-Managed Irrigation \n1578-PAK  Second Flood Protection (Sector) \nKorangi Wastewater Management \n874-PAK \n1413-PAK  National Drainage (Sector) \n837-PAK \n1297-PAK \n1294-PAK  Pehur High-Level Canal \n901-PAK \n1209-PAK \n976-PAK \n957-PAK \n1101-PAK \n1146-PAK  Hyderabad Water Supply and Sewerage \n\nUrban Water Supply and Sanitation \nFlood Damage Restoration (Sector) \nKarachi Sewerage \nKarachi Sewerage \nFaisalabad Water Supply, Sewerage, and Drainage \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\nTotal \n\n \n\nLoan \n\n \n\n \n\nProject \n\nPunjab Irrigation Sector Development Policy Loan \nSindh On-Farm Water Management Project \nAJK Community Infrastructure \nNWFP On-Farm Water Management Project \nBiodiversity Conservation Project \nNational Drainage Program Project \nPunjab Private Sector Groundwater Development Project \n2nd Karachi Water Supply \nFordwah Eastern Sadiqia (South) Irrigation and Drainage Project \nScarp Transition Project (02) \nKarachi Port Modernization Project \nOn-Farm Water Management Project (03) \nRural Water Supply and Sanitation Project \nPrivate Tubewell Development \nKarachi Water Supply and Sanitation Project (02) \nPunjab Urban Development Project \nIrrigation Systems Rehabilitation Project (02) \n\nSubtotal \nTotal \n\nTable A3.2: World Bank Lending to the Water Sector \n \n\nAJK = Azad Jammu Kashmir, NWFP = North-West Frontier Province \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n \nTable A3.3: Asian Development Bank Nonlending to Water Supply, Sanitation and Waste \nManagement \n\n \n\nLoan  \n\nProject \n\n4534-PAK  Sindh Basic Urban Services \n4432-PAK  Capacity Building for Environmental Management in Sindh \n4098-PAK  Rawalpindi Environmental Improvement \n3862-PAK  Punjab Community Water Supply and Sanitation \n2928-PAK  Quetta Water Supply and Environmental Improvement \n2006-PAK  Second Urban Water Supply and Sanitation \n\nAppendix 3      39 \n\nAmount  \n($ million) \n50.0  \n7.8 \n100.0 \n70.0  \n140.0 \n46.0  \n62.1 \n127.6 \n72.0  \n100.0 \n51.0  \n34.0  \n39.5  \n22.0  \n922.0  \n\nAmount \n($ million) \n100.0 \n61.1 \n20.0 \n21.4 \n10.1 \n285.0 \n56.0 \n91.9 \n54.2 \n20.0 \n91.4 \n83.6 \n136.7 \n34.4 \n125.0 \n90.0 \n79.5 \n1,360.3 \n2,282.8 \n\n28 Nov 2002 \n25 Mar 1999 \n13 Nov 1997 \n18 Sep 1997 \n12 Dec 1995 \n31 Jan 1995 \n08 Mar 1994 \n22 Dec 1993 \n04 Nov 1993 \n15 Dec 1992 \n14 Dec 1989 \n14 Dec 1989 \n15 Dec 1977 \n13 Apr 1976 \n\n \n\n \n\nDate Approved \n\n01 June 2006 \n20 May 2004 \n09 July 2002 \n12 Jun 2001 \n24 Apr 2001 \n04 Nov 1997 \n11 Jul 1996 \n09 Feb 1993 \n02 Jul 1992 \n04 Jun 1991 \n30 May 1991 \n21 May 1991 \n23 Apr 1991 \n11 Apr 1989 \n28 Feb 1989 \n12 Apr 1988 \n29 Mar 1988 \n\nAmount ($) \n\n0  \n400,000  \n350,000  \n125,000  \n0  \n0  \n\nDate Approved \n23 Dec 2004 \n12 Nov 2004 \n21 Apr 2003 \n04 May 2002 \n05 Dec 1997 \n03 Dec 1993 \n\n \n\n\f40         Appendix 3 \n\nLoan  \n\nProject \n\n1744-PAK  Water Supply and Sanitation Authority for Rawalpindi \n1736-PAK  Punjab Rural Water Supply Sector \n1349-PAK  Urban Water Supply and Sanitation \n1246-PAK  Strengthening of Billing and Collection Operations of the KWSB \n1245-PAK  Marine Outfall Study \n0963-PAK  Urban Water Supply and Sanitation Sector Study \n0297-PAK  Rawalpindi Water Supply and Sewerage \n0120-PAK  Hyderabad Water Supply, Sewerage and Drainage Development \n0119-PAK  Lyalipur Water Supply, Sewerage and Drainage Development \n \n\nSubtotal \n\nAmount ($) \n100,000  \n0  \n0  \n183,700  \n281,700  \n350,000  \n200,000  \n150,000  \n150,000  \n2,290,400 \n\n \n\nDate Approved \n18 Aug 1992 \n23 Jul 1992 \n08 Aug 1990 \n14 Dec 1989 \n14 Dec 1989 \n11 Mar 1988 \n28 Jun 1979 \n02 Jul 1974 \n02 Jul 1974 \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n \n\n\f \nItem \n\n \n\n \n \n\nI. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nDETAILED COST ESTIMATES \n($ \u2018000) \n\nADB Loan \n\nOCR \n\nADF \n\nGov\u2019t. of \nPunjab \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\nTotal  \n\nForeign \nExchange \n\nLocal \n(Excluding \nTaxes) \n\nDuties & \nTaxes \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\nSubtotal (A) \n\nLBDC Main Canal \n\n1.

Sector  Overview.  Improved  productivity  of  irrigated  agriculture  and  water  resources  is \nvital  to  Punjab\u2019s  economic  development.  Irrigated  agriculture  (i)  accounts  for  28%  of  Punjab\u2019s \ngross domestic product (GDP), (ii) employs more than 50% of the labor force, (iii) produces 90% \nof  Punjab\u2019s  agricultural  output,  and  (iv)  uses  more  than  95%  of  the  water  resources.  Punjab \nprovides about 58% of the Pakistan\u2019s GDP, and Punjab agricultural GDP is 66% of the national \nagricultural  GDP.  The  irrigated  agriculture  sector  is  crucial  to  attaining  the  6%\u20137%  growth \ntargeted by the Government of Punjab. The Government of Punjab\u2019s total outlay for irrigation in \n2006/07 is $142 million; a 21% increase over the allocation for 2005/06, and accounts for 13% \nof the core Annual Development Program (2006/07). The projected outlays are $200 million in \n2007/08 (41% increase) and $267 million in 2008/09 (33% increase). \n \n106.  The  Punjab  Irrigation  and  Power  Department  (PIPD)  is  responsible  for  operation  and \nmaintenance (O&M) and management of surface irrigation systems in Punjab that cover a gross \ncommand area of 9.5 million hectares (ha) and have a cultivable command area (CCA) of 8.4 \nmillion  ha.  The  replacement  value  of  government-owned  irrigation  and  water  resources \nmanagement  infrastructure  in  Punjab  is  about  $20  billion.  The  condition  of  infrastructure  has \nseriously  deteriorated  due  to  (i)  age  (much  is  nearly  100  years  old),  (ii)  lack  of  asset \nmanagement  planning,  and  (iii)  underfunding  and  ineffective  O&M.  The  estimated  cost  of \ndeferred  maintenance  is  about  $2  billion;  the  cost  to  modernize  the  systems  for  enhanced \nmanagement  capacity  is  about  $3.5  billion.  The  poor  condition  of  some  large  infrastructure \nposes failure risks, and overall irrigation service delivery is unreliable, particularly at tail ends of \ncanals.  Population  growth  and  farm  fragmentation  has  resulted  in  significantly  increased \ncropping intensities, driving demand for irrigation water far beyond the original design capacity \nfor  cropping  intensity.  To  meet  their  needs,  farmers  have  installed  private  tubewells  for \nincreased  reliability  and  water  supply;  no  effective  groundwater  management  is  in  place,  and \nmuch of Punjab has rapidly declining water tables.  \n \nB. \n \n107.  The Punjab Irrigated Agriculture Investment Program (PIAIP). The PIAIP and its first \nproject,  the  Lower  Bari  Doab  Canal  Improvement  Project  (LBDCIP),  will  result  in  economic \ngrowth  and  improved  sustainability  of  water  and  land  resources.  The  PIAIP  is  a  $900  million \ninvestment  program  proposed  for  financing  through  the  multitranche  financing  facility  of  the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB).  It  will  provide  (i)  rehabilitation  and  upgrading  (R&U)  of \nirrigation  infrastructure,  (ii)  institutional  reform  for  water  management,  (iii)  reformed  and \nrestructured  institutions  for  improved  and  sustainable  irrigation  service  delivery,  and  (iv) \ncapacity development. Investments subsequent to the LBDCIP include the: (i) Pakpattan Canal \nand  Sulemanki  Barrage,  (ii)  Thal  Canal,  (iii)  Sidhnai  Canal,  and  (iv)  Trimmu  and  Punjnad \nbarrages. The investment amount for the PIAIP is based on sector needs, funds devoted to the \nsector,  identified  projects,  the  absorptive  capacity  of  PIPD  and  Government  of  Punjab,  and \nanticipated inflation during the program period. \n \n108.  The LBDCIP. The Balloki Barrage diverts water to the Lower Bari Doab Canal (LBDC) \nirrigation  system  and  the  Balloki\u2013Sulemanki  Link  Canal  to  supply  irrigation  to  more  than  1.82 \nmillion ha. The barrage and LBDC irrigation system needs substantial R&U due to deterioration \nand to enhance management capacity for water distribution. The present CCA area of the LBDC \nis about 703,500 ha; originally designed to meet a cropping intensity of about 70%, which has \nincreased to 160%. Farmers have installed private tubewells to supplement canal water, and the \n\nThe Program and Project \n\n \n\n\f48        Appendix 8           \n\nOverview of the Economic and Financial Analyses \n\nconjunctive  use  of  surface  and  groundwater  makes  meeting  increasing  irrigation  demands \npossible.  The  groundwater  table  has  been  declining;  salinity  of  groundwater  has  been \nincreasing,  and  mixing  of  surface  and  groundwater  is  required  in  some  areas  to  ensure \nacceptable salinity levels. \n \n109.  The LBDCIP has five components related to the LBDC: (i) R&U of the Balloki Barrage; \n(ii)  R&U  of  the  LBDC  distribution  network,  (iii)  groundwater  management,  (iv)  on-farm  water \nmanagement  and  agriculture,  and  (v)  institutional  strengthening  and  operation  modernization. \nThe LBDCIP includes development of the Punjab irrigated agriculture project preparation facility, \nwhich  will  prepare  subsequent  projects  under  the  PIAIP.  The  LBDCIP  base  costs  are \napproximately  $198.3  million  for  the  five  components  directly  related  to  the  LBDC  and  will  be \nfinanced  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources.  The  Punjab  irrigated  agriculture  project \npreparation  facility  will  be  financed  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources  (Asian  Development \nFund)  with  a  base  cost  of  $9.4  million.1 Together  with  contingencies,  finances  charges,  and \ntaxes, the total cost of the LBDCIP is $281.4 million of which $217.8 million will be a loan from \nADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources;  $10  million  will  be  a  loan  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds \nresources, and $53.6 million will be financed by the Government of Punjab. \n \nC. \n \n110.  Demand Analysis. PIPD, a public agency, supplies canal water to the LBDC system at \na  fixed-rate  based  on  a  per  acre  rate  of  PRs80  for  the  kharif  season  and  PRs55  for  the  rabi \nseason  (total  of  PRs135  per  year  per  acre  or  about  PRs337  per  ha),  providing  no  direct \nconnection between the volume of water consumed and the prices paid. Similarly, the cost for \ncanal  water  is  not  based  on  the  full  cost  of  service  provision;  a  subsidy  supports  PIPD \noperations.  PIPD  is  a  monopoly  supplier  so  that  the  farmer  has  no  choice  with  regard  to  the \nmarket  for  surface  irrigation.  Pricing  and  consumption  is  therefore  distorted  for  many  reasons \nincluding political pressure to keep fees low. Irrespective of the pricing, in terms of demand, all \nof the irrigation water supplied by the canal is consumed, and the substantial development of \ngroundwater  reflects  that  demand  for  irrigation  water  is  significantly  greater  than  what  can  be \nsupplied through the canal system.2 This is underscored by the fact that groundwater may cost \n10  times  as  much  as  surface  water,  and  is  used  by  nearly  100%  of  the  farmers  in  the  LBDC \narea.3 The  additional  canal  provided  by  the  LBDCIP  is  not  expected  to  affect  demand  or  the \nprice  for  canal  water  within  a  market  framework.  However,  the  improved  service  delivery  and \ninstitutional  changes  with  management  oversight  by  water  users  makes  the  increase  of  fees \npossible  to  improve  cost  recovery  and  O&M.  Improved  canal  water  delivery  will  provide  a \nsubstitute  for  more  expensive  and  poorer  quality  groundwater,  stabilize  the  water  table,  and \nlead to a more sustainable agricultural production system. \n \n111.  With-  and  Without-Project  Scenario.  The  approach  to  the  economic  and  financial \nanalyses  is  based  on  projected  outcomes  with  and  without  the  Project.  The  without-project \nscenario  is  characterized  by  continued  degradation  of  the  entire  LBDC  irrigation  system.  This \nwill reduce canal water distribution, especially at the tails, and limit groundwater recharge, while \npumping  of  groundwater  increases  to  make  up  for  the  lack  of  canal  water.  This  will  result  in \nfurther  decline  of  the  water  table  with  subsequent  higher  pumping  costs,  replacement  of \ncentrifugal  tubewell  pumps  with  more  powerful  turbine  pumps,  and  possible  loss  of  access  to \ngroundwater  by  poorer  farmers  and  those  in  saline-affected  areas.  Mixing  of  canal  water  with \nsaline  groundwater  is  critical  to  sustain  the  current  cropping  intensity  at  the  tail  end.  While \n                                                 \n1   The PIAPPF is excluded from the economic and financial analysis of the LBDCIP. \n2   The number of tubewells in the LBDCIP area has increased from about 10,000 to 48,000 during the last 15 years. \n3   Groundwater  may  cost  from  PRs150  to  PRs300  per  hour,  which  is  generally  the  amount  needed  for  an  average \n\nsize field. Anywhere from 4 to 8 waterings may be required depending on the crop and soil conditions. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 8        49 \n\noverall  productivity  will  decline  and  all  farmers  will  suffer  in  the  without-project  scenario, \ntailenders, who are already the worst off, will suffer the most. In the with-project scenario, these \nnegative outcomes will be avoided. Not only will important productivity gains for the entire LBDC \noccur, but also significant positive equity implications for the tail ends will result. \n \n112.  Under  the  without-project  scenario,  the  Balloki  Barrage  and  its  associated  works  will \ncontinue to deteriorate, and continued use without R&U will increase the probability of damage \nor failure during a severe flood. This will cause a dire water shortage for the LBDC and Balloki\u2013\nSulemanki  Link  command  areas  and  result  in  excessive  pumping  and  further  depletion  of \ngroundwater  to  try  and  meet  irrigation  needs.  In  addition,  moderate  to  severe  floods  are \ncurrently  accommodated  by  breaching  of  the  right  bank  levy  above  the  barrage  in  order  to \nprotect it. This causes flood damage to crops and other assets in adjacent areas and inundates \nan important roadway to Faisalabad. \n \n113.  CCA  Assumptions. The economic and financial analyses of the LBDCIP were carried \nout  based  on  changes  in  gross  margins  from  the  incremental  agriculture  productivity.  To \naccount for the heterogeneity of LBDC\u2019s large 703,500 ha CCA, it was divided into three broad \ncategories  based  on  water  availability:  (i)  head  reaches  where  canal  water  supplies  are \nadequate and shortages are easily met from high-quality groundwater recharged from the canal \nwater; about 40% of the CCA (281,500 ha); (ii) middle-tail reaches with similar water availability \nto  head  reaches,  but  more  shortage  and  less  groundwater  recharge;  about  40%  of  the \ncommand (281,500 ha); and (iii) tail-saline where surface water supplies are usually inadequate \nand shortages not easily met from groundwater that is of poor quality, about 20% of the CCA or \n(140,500  ha).  The  density  of  tubewells  is  less  in  the  head  reach  due  to  sufficient  surface \nsupplies, and higher in middle and tail reaches. However, the marginal or brackish groundwater \ncauses less tubewell utilization in tail-saline areas because it diminishes crop productivity. \n \n114.  Prices.  The  LBDC  has  intensive  and  progressive  farming  compared  to  other  parts  of \nPunjab  with  crops  sold  in  numerous  markets  throughout  the  area.  Most  inputs  like  seed, \nfertilizers,  and  pesticides  are  provided  through  a  well-developed  network  of  private  dealers \nlocated  in  local  markets.  Farmgate  prices  in  the  analysis  were  established  after  market \nassessments and discussions with farmers. Financial prices were converted to economic prices \nthrough  standard  methods.  The  shadow  exchange  rate  was  estimated  by  weighting  the \neffective  export  and  import  exchange  rates  by  the  proportion  of  total  trade.  The  standard \nconversion factor for traded goods, the reciprocal of the shadow exchange rate, is estimated at \n90%. Import and export border parity prices for the main agricultural commodities and factors of \nproduction were calculated to establish the price relationship between the local market value of \ntraded  commodities  produced  on  the  farm  and  their  internationally  traded  values.  Financial \nprices  were  adjusted  to  economic  values  by  eliminating  transfer  payments  (subsidies  and \ntaxes) and adjusting the costs of traded inputs involved in the production chain (e.g., storage, \nfor \nhaulage,  and  processing).  Specific  economic  conversion \ninternationally  traded  agricultural  commodities  including  both  farm  produce  and  inputs  used \n(e.g., chemical fertilizers). \n \nD. \n \n115.  Nearly  all  the  project  benefits  (93%)  accrue  from  increased  agricultural  productivity \nwithin  the  LBDC  CCA  including  (i)  increased  cropping  intensity,  (ii)  increased  yields,  and  (iii) \ncrop diversification. Benefits are anticipated to increase to their full potential over 10 years with \ncropped  area  and  yield figures  being  interpolated  in  a  linear  fashion  between  years  1  and  10. \nBenefits start to be realized in year 5 of the Project for the R&U of the barrage, and in year 6 \nfrom increased productivity within the LBDC. The R&U is assumed to enable the LBDC to safely \n\nProject Benefits and Assumptions  \n\nfactors  were  calculated \n\n \n\n\f50        Appendix 8           \n\npass its maximum flow allocation of 278 cumecs when completed; an increase from the current \nmaximum  of  about  244  cumecs.  Distribution  of  water  supply  will  be  improved  through  canal \nR&U.  The  Project  is  assumed  to  have  a  30-year  life,  although  R&U  of  some  infrastructure \nshould yield benefits far longer than this. \n \n116.  Agricultural Productivity Benefits and Assumptions. To assess crop production and \nprojections, field surveys throughout the LBDC CCA were conducted during project preparation, \nand  secondary  data  sources  such  as  the  Punjab  Agriculture  Census  (2000)  were  consulted. \nBased  on  the  analysis,  cropping  intensity  is  projected  to  continually  increase  from  about  the \ncurrent  162%  to  172%  with  the  Project.  Without  the  Project,  cropping  intensity  is  assumed  to \ndecrease by 1%, although this may be much greater if groundwater tables continue to fall. Crop \nyields  are  anticipated  to  increase  from  about  2%  to  7%  depending  on  the  location  within  the \nLBDC. Crops currently with the greatest deficiencies in crop water requirements, which may be \nup to 30%\u201340% for cotton and wheat in some parts of the LBDC, will experience the greatest \ngains. Accordingly, cotton is anticipated to increase by 7%, potatoes by 5%, and wheat by 4.5%. \nMaize and  most other  crops are anticipated to increase by around 3%. The cropping intensity \nand  yields  are  based  on  a  weighted  average  of  the  three  defined  reaches  of  the  distribution \nsystem: head, middle-tail, and saline-tail. Diversification to high-value crops is also anticipated \nunder the Project due to the greater reliability of water. Table A8.1 provides cropping data. \n \n\nTable A8.1: LBDC Cropping With the Project and Incremental Production \n\nAnnual \nIncremental \nProduction \n(tons) \n75,353 \n11,730 \n9,005 \n47,642 \n42,556 \n12,387 \n105,240 \n11,550 \n140,889 \n50,739 \n288,181 \n223 \n148,541 \n38,453 \n \n \n\nCurrent \n(hectares) \n236,771 \n45,056 \n86,551 \n73,325 \n17,480 \n15,585 \n23,172 \n49,984 \n385,243 \n54,569 \n90,642 \n11,123 \n35,373 \n17,919 \n1,142,794 \n\nWith the Project \n(hectares) \n258,553  \n46,182  \n86,656  \n75,024  \n18,780 \n16,190 \n25,969  \n50,973  \n409,556  \n58,644  \n92,722  \n11,127  \n36,666  \n19,489  \n1,208,451  \n\nWithout the Project\n(hectares) \n234,768 \n44,923 \n86,335 \n72,942 \n17,471 \n15,432 \n22,914 \n47,459 \n383,053 \n54,321 \n90,097 \n11,110 \n34,667 \n17,725 \n1,133,217 \n\nCrop \nCotton \nMaize Autumn \nRice \nFodder (kharif)  \nFodder (kharif): maize  \nVegetables (kharif) \nPotato \nOther Kharif Crops \nWheat \nMaize Spring \nFodder (rabi): alfalfa, clover \nOther Rabi Crops \nSugarcane \nOrchards (mango, citrus) \nTotal Cropped Area \nCropping Intensity  \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates.  \n \n117. \nIncremental  Production.  The  production  of  crops  was  calculated  by  multiplying  unit \narea  yield  with  area  planted  under  those  crops.  Slight  decreases  anticipated  in  the  head \nreaches for fodder (sorghum) and vegetables were attributed to assumed crop diversification. In \nthe  lower  reaches  including  the  saline  areas,  the  production  is  likely  to  increase.  Area  under \nsugarcane and  orchards  is  likely  to  increase  owing  to  high  returns  and  soil/climatic  suitability. \nWithout the Project, production is likely to slightly decrease for all crops, particularly in the tail-\nsaline area. Incremental production is computed as the difference between with and without the \nProject at full development. \n\n161.1% \n\n171.8% \n\n162.4%\n\n \n\n\fAppendix 8        51 \n\n \n118.  Barrage Benefits and Assumptions. Barrage benefits are based on (i) damage to the \nBalloki Barrage and related infrastructure during an extreme flood event and reduced irrigation \nsupply  to  the  LBDC  and  irrigation  areas  supplied  by  the  Balloki\u2013Sulemanki  Link  Canal;  (ii) \nflooding  of  adjacent  areas  upstream  of  the  barrage  due  to  forced  breaching  of  the  right \nembankment  during  floods  to  protect  the  Balloki  Barrage  and  losses  from  damage  to  crops, \nassets, and infrastructure; and (iii) disruption to traffic on the Faisalabad road during floods.  \n \n119.  The  following  assumptions  were  made  in  quantifying  the  barrage  benefits.  If  fully \nbreached,  complete  reconstruction  will  take  place  in  3  years,  and  the  LBDC  and  Balloki\u2013\nSulemanki link systems will encounter water shortage for the same period.4 This will result in (i) \nincremental  costs  of  groundwater  pumping  to  substitute  for  canal  water;  (ii)  reduction  of \ncropping  intensity  by  7.5%  in  the  first  3  years  due  to  water  shortage,  with  cropping  intensity \ngradually restored during the next 6 years; (iii) 20% reduction in irrigation applications causing \n10%  yield  loss;  and  (iv)  reduction  of  number  of  tubewells  by  50%  due  to  lowered  water  table \nand  replacement  with  turbine  pumps.  A  5%  reduction  in  the  gross  margins  is  assumed  as \nfarmers use more brackish or marginal quality groundwater in the middle and tail sections of the \nLBDC.  The  avoided  costs  of  these  changes  were  calculated  as  part  of  barrage  benefits.  The \nestimation  of  direct  damage  caused  by  breaching  the  right  upstream  embankments  to  pass \nfloods is based on loss of crops, private assets, and public infrastructure was based on an area \nof 8,868 ha from historical flooding. Flooding of the road to Faisalabad causes traffic diversion \nresulting in loss of bridge tolls and higher transportation costs by freight trucks due to alternate \nincreased  travel  distances.  The  avoided  losses  are  used  as  benefits  for  3  years  following  the \nbarrage failure. \n \nE. \n \n120.  Economic  Analysis.  To  assess  the  economic  performance  of  the  entire  LBDCIP,  the \neconomic benefits from increased agricultural productivity and from R&U of the Balloki Barrage \nand  its  related  infrastructure  were  aggregated.  The  benefits  of  all  other  LBDCIP  components \nwere subsumed into the LBDCIP benefits in terms of water-use efficiency and yield gains. The \neconomic internal rate of return; net present value at 12% discount rate, which is assumed to be \nthe opportunity cost of capital; and benefit-cost ratios were calculated using the economic base \nproject  costs  (total  cost  excluding  contingencies).  Table  A8.2  presents  the  results  of  the \neconomic analysis, showing that the LBDCIP is economically feasible and generates benefits in \nexcess  of  costs  with  a  benefit-cost  ratio  of  1.96.  A  sensitivity  analysis  was  conducted  by \ndecreasing benefits and increasing costs by 20%; the economic internal rate of return is robust \neven when costs increase and benefits decrease. \n \n\nProject-Wide Analysis \n\nTable A8.2: Results of Economic Analysis  \n\nEIRR  NPV (PRs, m)  Benefit-Cost Ratio\nItem \n19.1%\nBase Case \n \nSensitivity Analysis \n17.1%\nCost Increases by 20% \nBenefits Decrease by 20% \n16.7%\nCost Increases by 20% and Benefits Decrease by 20% 14.7%\nSwitching Value at 12% Opportunity Cost of Capital  \nIncrease in Total Cost \n \nDecrease in Benefits \nEIRR = economic internal rate of return, NPV = net present value, PRs, m = Pakistani rupees, in millions \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n                                                 \n4   About one third of the supply is assumed to be provided with a temporary structure during construction. \n\n8,033 \n \n6,353 \n4,746 \n3,066 \n\n1.96 \n \n1.63 \n1.57 \n1.30 \n\n87% \n47% \n\n \n\n \n\n\f52        Appendix 8           \n\n \n121.

A sensitivity \nanalysis  was  conducted  by  decreasing  benefits  and  increasing  costs  by  20%.  The  financial \ninternal rate of return is robust above a 12% return in all cases except the combined increase in \ncosts and decrease in benefits where it dips slightly below to 11.8%, but the financial returns will \nbe important to LBDC farmers. \n \n\nTable A8.3: Results of Financial Analysis \n\nFIRR (%) NPV (PRs, m)  Benefit-Cost Ratio\n\n \nBase Case \nSensitivity Analysis \nCost Increases by 20% \nBenefits Decrease by 20% \nCost Increases by 20% and Benefits Decrease by 20%\nSwitching Value at 12% Opportunity Cost of Capital  \nIncrease in Total Cost  \nDecrease in Benefits \n\n16.1 \n \n14.1 \n13.7 \n11.8 \n\n47 \n32 \n\n4,458 \n \n2,576 \n1,684 \n(198) \n\n1.47 \n \n1.23 \n1.18 \n0.98 \n\n \n\n \n\n FIRR = financial internal rate of return, NPV = net present value, PRs, m = Pakistani rupees, in millions \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n \n122.  Farmer  Benefits Based on social and land tenure data gathered during preparation of \nthe LBDCIP, the Project will have an important impact on rural incomes and rural poverty. About \n275,000 farm families live in the LBDC command area with an average family size of 6.8, so the \nProject will impact nearly 2 million people. Land ownership is skewed, with about 12% of farm \nfamilies holding nearly 45% of the farm area in the medium- to large-farm category (farm size is \nabove 5 ha). Their average landholding is 9.6 ha. However, the vast majority are smaller farms \nbelow 5 ha, which is about 55% of the LBDC command area, 88% of all farms, and owned by \nabout 240,000 farm families (1.65 million people). The average landholding within this group is \n1.6  ha.  Based  on  this,  a  representative  small-farm  model  was  created  to  simulate  the  project \nimpact on a 1.64 ha average farm. Based on this model, the gross margin of the average small \nfarm will see an annual increase in income from about $1,204 to $1,284 or an annual increase \nof  income  of  7%  at  full  development.  Within  the  LBDC,  about  20%  of  the  command  area  is \noccupied by farms that are less than 2 ha, yet due to the skewed land tenure this 20% of the \narea  supports  58%  of  the  farms  and  farm  families  or  over  1  million  people.  The  average \nlandholding  for  this  group  of  farmers  is  0.9  ha;  many  of  these  farmers  are  operating  at  a \nsubsistence  level.  Project  impacts  were  simulated  on  a  small  farm  (0.91  ha)  in  the  tail-saline \nportion of the command area. Under the Project, this farmer will see an annual increase in gross \nmargins from about $694 to $772, or an annual increase of income of 11% at full development. \nProject benefits will thus have the greatest impact on farmers who are currently the worst off in \nthe LBDC. \n \n19. \nRisk Analysis. Most benefits come from incremental agricultural production. The Project \nis  more  sensitive  to  a  decrease  in  benefits  than  to  an  increase  in  costs;  thus  loss  or  delay  of \nbenefits poses the largest risk. The comprehensive and integrated approach of the Project helps \nto mitigate this risk. The Project addresses water management at all levels including the canal \nsystem,  on-farm  water  management,  and  groundwater  management \nthat \nsupplemental  irrigation water  and  improved  conveyance  efficiency  result  in  water reaching  the \nroot  zone  of  the  plant  and  greater  productivity.  In  addition  to  improved  water  supply  and \nmanagement, the Project includes support for agricultural support services that will help farmers \nmake the best use of the improved irrigation water to achieve productive benefits. \n \n\nto  ensure \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 8        53 \n\nAdditional Benefits. In addition to the quantified benefits in the analysis, the PIAIP and \n20. \nthe LBDCIP have other benefits that are not quantified, but will help ensure a robust economic \nand financial return. The institutional changes will enhance irrigation service delivery, especially \nO&M, improving water distribution with important equity and productivity gains; however, project \nbenefits are not directly contingent upon the institutional reforms. Emphasis on the management \nof  groundwater  will  ensure  that  this  resource  is  conserved  and  used  in  a  sustainable  manner, \nwhich  will  reduce  pumping  costs  to  farmers  and  ensure  current  cropping  intensity  can  be \nmaintained. \n\n \n\n\f54        Appendix 9           \n\nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY  \n \n\nA. \n\nLinkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \n\nIs the sector identified as a national \npriority in country poverty analysis?   \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  Yes \n\n    No \n\n \n\n \nIs  the  sector  identified  as  a  national \npriority  in  country  poverty  partnership \nagreement?   \n\n \n Yes \n \n  No \n\nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in Pakistan:  \nLand  and  water  resources  are  among  Pakistan\u2019s  most  valuable  assets  and  fundamental  to  the  agriculture  sector, \nparticularly  in  Punjab.  The  province\u2019s  irrigation  system  is  the  largest  in  Pakistan,  but  due  to  deterioration  caused  by \nneglect and inadequate resources, requires rehabilitation.  The Program will  address these problems starting  with  its \nfirst intervention in the Lower Bari Doab Canal (LBDC) command area, not only to benefit landowners with access to \nirrigation,  but  to  improve  management  of  irrigation  systems  by  farmers,  benefiting  share  croppers  and  the  landless. \nSeventy  percent  of  the  LBDC  population  is  rural,  depending  almost  entirely  on  agriculture  for  its  livelihood.  Irrigated \nagriculture is vital to sustain the livelihood base, and surface water an essential source, particularly in areas suffering \nfrom groundwater contamination. \n \nPunjab is the most agriculturally productive province in Pakistan. Despite being labeled the \u201cbread basket\u201d of Pakistan, \nit has a surprisingly high incidence of poverty at 32.4% of the rural and 26.5% of the urban population. While Punjab \nhas districts producing the most food surplus in all of Pakistan, it also demonstrates high intensities of food insecurity, \nparticularly in rural areas. The Pakistan Human Condition Report (2002) states that the incidence of food insecurity in \nrural Punjab increased during 5 years, from 24.5% of the rural population in 1993/1994, to 35.8% by 1998/1999. By \n2003, rural communities in the four districts in the LBDC command area were experiencing food insecurity: Khanewal \nthe highest intensity at 37% of the rural population; Kasur at 33.8%; Sahiwal at 33.6%; and Okara at 32.4%. \n \nLandholdings  have  fragmented  due  to  inheritance  patterns,  while  parts  of  the  command  area  are  affected  by  water \nand soil salinity. Coupled with insecurity of surface water supply, these factors have contributed to degradation of land \nresources,  causing  land  shortages,  increased  marginalization  of  small  farmers,  and  increased  stress  migration  of \nworking  males  in  some  parts  of  the  command  area.  In  response  to  these  factors,  the  intensity  of  agriculture  has \nincreased to squeeze more productivity out of land that is becoming less productive. Cropping intensity in the area has \nincreased  over  time  from  the  historical  design  of  about  60%  to  70%  to  close  to  160%,  placing  excess  demand  on \nirrigation water. Shortage of irrigation water is particularly acute in the tail reaches of canals where limited or often no \nwater at all reaches farmers. In response to the need for additional water, farmers have installed tubewells, which has \nin  some  cases  accelerated  degradation  of  land  resources  through  increased  salinity  from  saline  groundwater,  and \nwater tables have been dropping, increasing the pumping costs for farmers who own wells and the remaining farmers \nwho are forced to purchase tubewell water. As the water table continues to drop, only more expensive turbine pumps \nwill be viable, favoring better-off farmers. The Project will stem this downward cycle through improved surface water \nirrigation  supplies,  reduce  the  amount  of  groundwater  needed,  as  well  as  stabilize  the  groundwater  table  to  allow \nsustainable exploitation of this vital resource for all farmers.  \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                      Targeting Classification: General Intervention \n \n\nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?  \nApart from the general assessment of poverty and its characteristics, the required poverty analysis has addressed the \nlinkages  between  the  rural  poor  and  irrigated  agriculture,  and  the  needs  of  poor  agriculture-dependent  households. \nThe Project comprises a number of elements that will have direct benefits for the poor. \n \nA  social  and  poverty  assessment  was  carried  out  for  each  of  the  subprojects  in  compliance  with  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) Guidelines on the Incorporation of Social Dimensions in Bank Operations (1993). It included \nan assessment of the incidence of poverty, which revealed the nature and perceptions of its causes: (i) gender bias, \n(ii)  landholding  fragmentation,  (iii)  inequitable  access  to  infrastructure  and  facilities,  (iv)  poor  health,  (v)  basic  needs \nnot met (health, nutrition, education), and (vi) lack of alternative livelihoods to agriculture.   \n \nThe social analysis identified especially vulnerable groups within the population, who would be unable to benefit fully \nfrom  project  interventions  without  some  social  preparation.  These  include  (i)  households  headed  by  women,  (ii) \nlandless, (iii) marginal farmers owning less than 2 hectares (ha) of land, (iv) tenants and sharecroppers dependent on \nless  than  2  ha  of  land,  and  (v)  landless  persons  living  on  and  using  right-of-way  land.  The  Project  will  ensure  that \nservices  delivered  through  the  field  programs  under  the  on-farm  water  management  and  agriculture  component  will \nhave programs targeted for marginal and landless farmers. \n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 9         55 \n\nC.  Participation Process \n\n   No \n\n  Yes \n\n   No  \n\n   Yes               \n\nIs there a stakeholder analysis? \n \nIs there a participation strategy? \n \nStakeholders, beneficiaries, and people directly affected have been consulted, and will continue to be consulted during \nfinalization  of  project  design  and  implementation.  A  participatory  and  consultative  methodology  was  adopted  to \nundertake social analysis during the project preparatory technical assistance. It involved (i) initial field reconnaissance \ndiscussions with project stakeholders, (ii) focus group discussions with women in core subproject areas, (iii) detailed \nhousehold  survey  with  male  respondents  in  core  subproject  areas,  (iv)  key  informant  interviews,  and  (v)  detailed \nsurvey questionnaires of households directly affected by land acquisition and civil works on the rights-of-way. \n \nDuring project implementation, the participation of stakeholders will be supported and deepened with the assistance of \nkey  project  staff  and  local  nongovernment  organizations.  Communication  strategies  will  be  developed  for  farmers \nconcerning schedules of canal closures. A dedicated resettlement cell will be part of the project management unit to \nensure resettlement activities are addressed according to ADB guidelines. Farmers organizations will be an output of \nthe Project so the Project is inherently participation oriented, and the farmer organizations will ensure close linkages \nare established between the project implementation team and the community. The Project will ensure a participatory \napproach  to  detailed  design  of  the  irrigation  works,  and  the  institutional  capacity  of  farmer  organizations  will \nsubsequently  be  developed  to  facilitate  sustainable  operation  and  maintenance  of  the  irrigation  system.  Community \nfacilitators will be responsible for identifying and assisting disadvantaged and vulnerable groups. \n \nParticipation Strategy required: Yes, included in resettlement and participatory development activities. \n\nD.  Gender Development \n\n  \nStrategy  to  maximize  impacts  on  women:  The  social  analysis  confirmed  that  women  from  poor  households  are \nproportionately at greater disadvantage. Compared to women in households headed by men, households headed by \nwomen are especially vulnerable: they have a lower level of education; inadequate adult labor; limited access to land, \ncredit, and agricultural extension; and lower income. A high proportion lives below the poverty line.   \n \nA  gender  strategy  will  be  developed  in  the  first  year  of  the  Project,  ensuring  the  implementation  of  gender-sensitive \nactivities  to  be  delivered  through  the  on-farm  water  management  and  agriculture  component.  In  addition  to  these \ntargeted  components,  mainstream  gender  activities  will  take  place  through  the  Project.  Women\u2019s  groups  will  be \nformed during implementation of civil works in the minor and distributary canals for consultation about the placement \nof  minor  infrastructure  such  as  bridges  and  required  access  points  for  washing  or  other  nonirrigation  uses.  An \ninternational gender specialist has been hired to assist with developing these activities and a full-time domestic gender \nspecialist  will  support  these  activities  throughout  implementation  of  the  Project.  A  similar  approach  will  be  used  in \nsubsequent projects under the Program, and activities and implementation modalities  will be refined based on close \nmonitoring and evaluation lessons identified.  \n\nHas an output been prepared? \n\n    Yes \n\n   No \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fE.

The  Government  of  Punjab  will  ensure  that  all \nEIAs and/or IEEs are approved by ADB and that relevant government agencies adhere to them \nduring design, construction, and operation phases. \n \n2. \nThe  Lower  Bari  Doab  Canal  Improvement  Project  (LBDCIP)  will  be  the  first  activity \nfinanced  under  the  PIAIP  and  is  classified  as  category  B  in  accordance  with  ADB  guidelines. \nEnvironmental impacts were assessed through a full EIA, as required by the Punjab provincial \ngovernment due to the presence of two protected areas within the project area, the fact that the \nproject area is larger than 20,000 hectares (ha), and resettlement is expected. The Project is not \nexpected to have major or long-term adverse impacts, and negative impacts are expected to be \nonly temporary and mainly associated with construction, or will be mitigated during the life of the \nProject.  The  Project  is  expected  to  have  an  overall  positive  impact,  through  improved  water \nresource  management  from  the  main  LBDC  system  down  to  the  on-farm  level.  Significant \nproject  benefits  are  expected,  as  the  activities  will  help  reverse  the  present  trend  of  falling \ngroundwater tables and reduce groundwater salinity. \n \n3. \nThe  Project\u2019s  EIA  was  carried  out  following  the  rules  and  regulations  of  the  Pakistan \nEnvironmental  Protection  Act  (1997),  Pakistan  EIA  Review  Regulations  (2000),  Pakistan \nEnvironmental  Assessment  Procedures \n(1997),  and  ADB  Environmental  Assessment \nGuidelines  (2003).  These  were  followed  as  a  minimum,  and  various  other  guidelines  were \nconsulted  and  followed  during  the  course  of  the  study.  The  EIA  study  components  included \nscoping, screening, stakeholder consultation, secondary and primary data collection, review of \nalternatives,  identification  and  assessment  of  impacts,  recommendations  for  mitigation \nmeasures,  and  development  of  an  environmental  monitoring  plan  (EMP)  and  environmental \nassessment  framework  (EAF)  (Supplementary  Appendix  C  for  the  EIA,  EMP,  and  EAF).  The \nactivities for preparation of the EIA satisfy all ADB procedures for a category A project. \n \nPublic  Consultation.  Extensive  public  consultations  were  held  with  various \n4. \nstakeholders \nlocal  communities,  government  agencies,  and  nongovernment \norganizations. A number of workshops were organized. Public workshops and general meetings \nwere held in (i) Sahiwal on 14 July and 12 August 2006, (ii) Miachannu on 14 August 2006, and \n(iii)  a  civil  society  workshop  was  held  with  nongovernment  organizations  and  stakeholders  in \nLahore  on  4  August  2006.  Surveys  of  the  current  environmental  situation  were  undertaken  as \npart  of  the  preparation  of  the  EIA,  and  a  wide  cross-section  of  stakeholders\u2019  concerns  and \nsuggestions  were  recorded  and  incorporated  into  the  EIA.  Following  EIA  submission  for \napproval by the Environmental Protection Department, a public hearing will be held. Prior to the \npublic hearing, the department will circulate copies of the EIA to the concerned agencies. \n \nA. \n \n5. \nLBDC Physical Environment. The LBDC command area, approximately 700,000 ha, is \npart of a vast plain of alluvial deposits from tributary rivers of the Indus. The command area is \nbounded by the Ravi River in the north and the Sukh Beas drainage channel in the south. The \nUpper Bari Doab Canal command area forms its north-eastern boundary and the Sidhnai Canal \ncommand forms the south-western boundary. The climate of the project area is characterized by \n\nThe Project Area \n\nincluding \n\n \n\n\f58        Appendix 10           \n\nhot summers and moderate and pleasant winters. The average annual rainfall varies from 650 \nmillimeters (mm) for Lahore in the east, to 210 mm in the southwest for Multan. \n \n6. \nThe LBDC overlies a large groundwater aquifer, which is made up of alluvial sediments \ndeposited through the river system. The depth of the water table has changed significantly due \nto irrigation system construction in the area. Before the irrigation system, the water table was at \nan average depth of about 30 meters (m), but it rose to 0\u20131.5 m in certain parts of the command \narea  due  to  seepage  from  the  canal  system,  and  caused  significant  land  degradation.  Due  to \nthe  rampant  growth  of  tubewells  over  the  last  decades,  the  groundwater  table  has  been \ndropping,1 as  evidenced  by  the  decrease  in  the  amount  of  water-logged  areas:  from  10%  in \n1962\u20131965 to virtually 0% in 2001/2002. The total number of private tubewells in the command \narea is estimated to be around 48,000. The command area is a conjunctive-use farming system \ndue  to  growing  cropping  intensity  and  demand  for  canal  water;  reliance  on  groundwater  has \nincreased  over  the  years.  Presently  groundwater  abstraction  is  estimated  to  be  around  4,564 \nmillion cubic meters per year, accounting for more than 50% of crop water requirements.  \n \nThe main surface water resource in the project area is the canal irrigation system. The \n7. \nLBDC exits the left bank of Ravi River at the Balloki Barrage. The current canal design capacity \nis 244 cumecs against a sanctioned discharge of 278 cumecs. Any shortfall in irrigation is met \nby  pumping  groundwater  and  occasional  rainfall,  although  overall  the  system  is  in  deficit. \nPollution in Ravi River is the highest of any river in Punjab. Most wastewater discharges in the \nriver  reach  between  Lahore  and  the  Balloki  Barrage  Complex.  The  Ravi  receives  untreated \nwastewater from the city of Lahore through a number of discharge points. The industries located \nin the city also discharge their untreated wastewater into the system; during low flows the river \nhas a high concentration of wastewater effluent. \n \nThe  current  macro  habitats  within  the  project  area  include  agricultural  lands,  wetlands \n8. \n(including \nforests \n(Chichawatni and Khanewal plantations\u2014the protected areas). Agricultural land occupies more \nthan 90% of the project area. The current habitats are a modification of an old land use regime \nwhere  the  area  supported  tropical  plains  thorn  forests,  mainly  comprising  woodlands.  These \nwoodlands were subjected to heavy grazing and uncontrolled felling of trees, and were further \nmodified by the introduction of the canal irrigation system in the early 1900s. \n \n9. \nDue  to  long-term  anthropogenic  disturbance,  the  area  has  limited  value  for  fauna. \nHowever,  the  two  protected  areas  within  the  LBDC  command  area,  the  Chichawatni  and  the \nPirowal  forest  plantations,  are  both  classified  as  wildlife  sanctuaries  under  provincial  law  and \ncover an area of approximately 4,610 ha and 4,800 ha and have a protective buffer zone of 4.8 \nkilometers.  Kharal  Lake,  previously  a  wildlife  sanctuary,  has  recently  been  declassified  due  to \ntotal desiccation of the lake.  \n \nHuman Environment. The population of the area is about 4.5 million to 5.0 million. The \n10. \naverage population growth rates in the districts covering the command area vary from 2.4 to 3.3. \nThe average family size is 8.6. Population density is very high throughout the command area, \namong  the  highest  in  Punjab.  The  bulk  of  the  population  is  located  in  Khanewal.  The  project \narea is characterized by numerous identity groups, organized into biraderis (clans). The biraderi \nremains important in demarcating social and economic relationships. Respondents during social \nsurveys confirmed that the biraderi still defines what they do and who they do it with. The nature \nof  inter-biraderi  relationships  is  commonly  cooperative.  Mostly  farmers  from  the  same  biraderi \n\nthe  reservoir,  canal  system,  and  small  water \n\nimpoundments),  and \n\n                                                 \n1  In 1990, the LDC had about 10,000 tubewells; in 2005 this number was estimated to be 48,000. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 11         59 \n\nProject Impacts \n\nsettle around a water course; however, this pattern varies and is most dominant in the Sahiwal \ndivision. Dispute resolution is also through biraderis and formal institutions are rarely accessed. \n \n11. \nThe  project  area  has  better  than  average  access  to  facilities  such  as  schools,  health \nunits,  hospitals,  and  animal  extension  services  compared  to  most  of  Punjab.  Electricity  and \npublic  transportation  are  also  generally  available.  However,  the  level  of  access  and  service \nvaries between villages, and between facilities as well. Sanitation conditions are very poor, with \nfew  covered  sewerage  systems.  In  urban  areas  adjacent  to  the  main  LBDC,  open  sewers \ndischarge into the canal. The project area is a part of the Indus Valley civilization, which is one \nof  the  world's  first  urban  civilizations.  Three  major  sites  of  archaeological  interest  are  in  the \nproject area: Bawani, Harappa, and Tulamba. \n \nAlmost 94% of the farms in the command area are less than 10 ha. The number of large \n12. \nfarms (> 10 ha) and the amount of land cultivated by them has reduced over the years. The land \ntenure  system  is  characterized  by  owner,  owner-and-tenant,  and  tenant  farmers.  More  than \n60% of the farms and 53% of the farm area is cultivated by the owners. \n \nB. \n \n13. \nThe  impacts  were  identified  and  assessed  for  their  significance  keeping  in  view  their \nlikelihood,  consequence,  reversibility,  duration,  location,  and  timing.  Where  necessary  or \npossible,  the  impacts  of  construction  and  postconstruction  (operation)  were  assessed \nseparately.  The  EIA  includes  recommendations  for  mitigation,  management,  and  monitoring \nmeasures based on best practices. \n \nGroundwater  and  Irrigation  Water  Supplies. Groundwater pumping has resulted in a \n14. \ndecline  in  the  groundwater  table  by  about  0.37 meters  per  year  across  the  command  area.2 If \nthe water table continues to fall at this rate, many centrifugal pumps (those that currently supply \ntubewells) will no longer be viable, and only turbine pumps that are more expensive to purchase \nand operate will be viable. This change would (i) favor more wealthy farmers who could make \nthe investment in turbine pumps, (ii) increase the cost of groundwater to farmers who purchase \nwater, and (iii) possibly limit groundwater availability for farmers who are currently reliant on it.  \n \nDue  to  the  abstraction  of  groundwater  and  the  falling  water  table,  saline  and  water-\n15. \nlogged areas within the command area have been reduced from 17% to less than 5% in the last \n10  years.  However,  the  overdraft  of  groundwater  in  freshwater  zones  may  lead  to  the  lateral \nmigration  and  intrusion  of  saline  groundwater  into  freshwater  zones,  which  could  ultimately \nrender  it  unfit  for  drinking  and  irrigation.  Additional  canal  supplies  through  the  Project  will \nprovide more water to the command area; the additional water is expected to increase recharge \nto the water table and offset the current imbalance (where withdrawals exceed recharge). If the \nsituation is reversed where recharge exceeds abstraction, the water table could start to rise and \npossibly cause soil salinity and water logging. \n \n16. \nA return to high water tables is considered very improbable due to the current pumping; \nthe  additional  canal  supplies  are  expected  to  enable  (i)  increased  cropping  in  the  command \narea,  and  (ii)  increased pumping  of  groundwater.  Groundwater  levels  will  be  monitored  during \nthe  Project  under  the  groundwater  component  and  if  the  groundwater  table  starts  to  rise  to \nwhere  it  poses  dangers,  mitigation  measures  such  as  increasing  the  share  of  groundwater \nwithin the conjunctive-use system and reducing canal water supplies to that particular area will \nbe employed. \n\n                                                 \n2   Severe drought occurred from about 2000 to 2003. \n\n \n\n\f60        Appendix 10           \n\n \n17. \nProtected  Areas.  Impacts  on  the protected  areas  (Chichawatni  and  Pirowal  plantation \nforests)  and  their  buffer  zones  are  minimal.  The  main  canal  or  the  construction  works  will  not \nencroach into the Pirowal plantation areas, which are more than 1 km from the main canal. The \nmain canal will not encroach or enter the Chichawatni plantation as a result of canal widening, \nas the canal right-of-way within this reach is at least 100 m from the canal centerline, leaving a \nstrip  of  at  least  50  m  on  either  side  of  the  canal,  which  is  sufficient  to  accommodate  the \nproposed  canal  widening.  No  civil  works  are  proposed  for  the  distributaries  within  the  areas. \nPotential impacts will be limited to temporary disturbance to wildlife during construction works. \nRecommended measures to minimize noise, wastes, and impacts on wildlife and vegetation will \nmitigate  impacts.  Wildlife  surveys  will  be  undertaken  before,  during,  and  after  construction  to \nascertain the level of impacts and adopt any required additional mitigation measures. As per the \nPunjab  Wildlife  Act  (1974),  no  person  can  enter  or  reside  in  a  wildlife  sanctuary  or  the  buffer \nzone  of  a  wildlife  sanctuary  that  extends  3  miles  from  the  boundary  on  all  sides.  Prior  to \nconstruction  activities,  the  boundary  of  the  protected  areas  will  be  identified  and  marked  with \nsign boards.  \n \n18. \nTree Felling. A potential impact will be the felling of trees along the main canal due to its \nwidening  and/or  reinforcement.  The  total  number  of  trees  is  estimated  at  62,000;  however, \nmany will not be affected by the civil works, and most are second growth timber planted during \nthe  canal  construction.  Felling  of  trees  along  the  distributaries  should  be  minimal,  as  less \nwidening  is  required  for  the  civil  works.  Depending  on  the  location  of  the  trees,  their  removal \ncould benefit or negatively impact the integrity of the canal bank and all efforts will be made to \nmaximize safety. Removal of trees may cause disturbance to wildlife that rely on the trees. Prior \nto execution of civil works, an inventory of trees to be cut will be prepared with the assistance of \nthe forest officials, and a reforestation program will be prepared. The program will give details of \nthe  species  to  be  planted,  number  of  saplings  required,  layout  of  the  planting,  operation  and \nmaintenance requirements, and a detailed cost estimate. Budget is included for the reforestation \nprogram. \n \n19. \nFish. Fish stocks in Ravi River in Pakistan have declined over the years due to reduced \nflows; the Indus Water Treaty of 1960 gives the vast majority of the water rights of the Ravi to \nIndia (the Ravi only delivers about 5% of the supply to the LBDC and the rest is from diversions \nthrough the link canal system) and increased industrial and domestic pollution (from Lahore city \nand industrial areas). However, this impact has been muted at the Balloki Barrage Complex due \nto water received through the link canal system; fishing continues to result in productive catch \nfrom  the  area.  The  main  canal  is  also  stocked  annually  through  the  release  of  hatchlings. \nFishing  rights  are  currently  contracted  and  fish  catch  in  the  main  canal  takes  place  during \nclosure when all fish for that year are captured. \n \nReduction  in  fish  stock  due  to  construction  activities  is  unlikely,  however,  temporary \n20. \ndisplacement  of  fish  from  the  immediate  area  of  the  civil  works  within  the  barrage  pond  area \nmay  occur.  Most  species  of  river  fish  spawn  during  the  flood  seasons  with  spawning  grounds \nover  the  flood  plain.  In  the  Balloki  Barrage  Complex,  this  occurs  upstream  in  the  shallow \nconfines  of  the  marginal  bunds.  Local  fisherfolk  confirm  that  fish  spawning  occurs  mostly  in \nshallow depths on the periphery of the pond area behind the barrage where vegetation cover is \nsuitable. Breeding and spawning occurs May through August, when fishing is not permitted. \n \nAfter the rehabilitation works, the barrage may be operated at a finished surface level of \n21. \nthe pond of 193.2 m, which is an increase from the design finished surface level of 192.9 m for \nthe pond behind the Balloki Barrage Complex. The raising of the pond\u2019s finished surface level \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 11         61 \n\nEnvironmental Management and Mitigation \n\nwill increase the backwater aerial coverage of the pond within the marginal bunds as well as the \nwater  depth  at  the  periphery  of  the  pond;  yet  the  possible  increase  will  not  diminish  the \nspawning sites. Currently, the Balloki Barrage Complex is operated at levels higher than 192.9 \nm (193.4 m recorded on 2 June 2006) and hence the possible new operating finished surface \nlevel will not be a significant change from the present conditions.  \n \n22. \nThe proposed rehabilitation and upgrading (R&U) works at the barrage lie outside of the \nfishing grounds and hence will not interfere with fishing activity, nor are they expected to reduce \nfish  catch.  Fishing  in  the  main  canal  is  normally  only  undertaken  at  the  time  of  canal  closure. \nThis is usually done in the first week after the canal closure, as after that the volume and quality \nof water cannot sustain fish life.  \n \nC. \n \n23. \nAn EMP was prepared that addresses impacts of the Project to enhance project benefits \nand to introduce standards of good practice to be adopted for all project works. The EMP, along \nwith  all  other  activities  and  outputs  from  the  Project,  also  provide  guidance  for  subsequent \nprojects  to  be  taken  up  under  the  Program.  The  overall  responsibility  for  compliance  with  the \nEMP  rests  on  the  Punjab  Irrigation  and  Power  Department  (PIPD).  The  project  management \nunit  (PMU)  will  be  headed  by  an  overall  project  director  who  will  be  assisted  by  five \ndepartmental directors. One of the directors will be the director, monitoring and evaluation, who \nwill oversee implementation and compliance with the EMP, as well as all resettlement activities. \nThis  director  will  be  assisted  by  a  dedicated  assistant  directors  for  the  environment  and \nresettlement, who will be recruited from the market and be specialists in their respective fields. \n \nThe PMU will be supported by consultants for design and supervision of the civil works. \n24. \nBoth the PMU and design and supervision consultants will have staff dedicated to environment \nand  resettlement  activities,  and  the  PMU  will  have  overall  responsibility  to  supervise  and \nmonitor environmental and social compliance of the civil works contractors. Each contractor will \nbe required to appoint a dedicated field environmental and social officer at the project site, who \nwill  be  responsible  for  ensuring  implementation  of  the  EMP.  The  EMP  includes  a  mitigation \nprogram  that  lists  the  mitigation  measures  to  be  implemented  during  the  Project,  defines \nresponsibilities  for  implementation  of  the  mitigation  measures,  and  provides  rough  cost \nestimates for impact mitigation (which are included in the overall project costs). \n \n25. \nThe monitoring program will have two types of monitoring: compliance monitoring by the \nPMU, consultants, and contractors to ensure that the requirements of the EMP are being met; \nand  effects  monitoring  to  monitor  unanticipated  impacts  of  the  Project.  The  effects  monitoring \nprogram  includes  noise  monitoring  at  selected  construction  sites;  monitoring  of  groundwater \nlevel  and  salinity;  fish  surveys  and  wildlife  surveys  (in  protected  areas)  to  validate  the  EIA\u2019s \nassessment of impacts; and identification of any needed additional mitigation measures and/or \nsocial surveys for affected communities. \n \n26. \nAs  part  of  the  environmental  preparations  for  the  Project  and  the  PIAIP,  an  EAF  was \ndrafted. The EAF provides guidance for PIPD staff and consultants through detailed procedures \nfor  assessing  and  mitigating  environmental  impacts  to  be  integrated  into  subsequent  projects \nunder the PIAIP, and for execution of the EMP for the LBDCIP. All processes and procedures in \nthe  EAF  will  ensure  compliance  to  Punjab  government  environmental  policies  and  legislation \nand  ADB  environmental  safeguard  guidelines.  The  EAF  will  ensure \nincorporation  of \nenvironmentally sound practices in the project design and mainstream environmental sensitivity \nin the PIPD. \n \n\n \n\n\f62        Appendix 10           \n\nConclusions \n\nThe LBDCIP will support R&U of various water resources and irrigation, and will include \n27. \nactivities  expected  to  have  some  limited  environmental  impacts  such  as  the  modernization  of \nthe  Balloki  Barrage  and  other  activities  on  a  much  smaller  scale  with  relatively  insignificant \nenvironmental  impacts,  such  as  remodeling  existing  smaller  distributary  systems.  All  of  the \nproject activities are classified as category B and C, and IEE reports and a summary IEE will be \nprepared.  \n \nD. \n \n28. \nThe  LBDCIP  is  anticipated  to  bring  about  a  net-positive  benefit  in  terms  of  improved \nwater  resource  management  (from  the  on-farm  level  through  to  the  LBDC  system)  and \nagricultural  productivity  in  the  area.  Negative  environmental  and  social  impacts  of  the  Project \nwill  be  associated  with  the  construction  phase,  and  will  be  temporary  or  reversible,  phased, \nlocalized, and manageable. \n \n29. \nThe significant beneficial effects of the Project will be reversing the present trend of the \nfalling  groundwater  table  and  improving  groundwater  salinity  levels  through  both  increased \ncanal  water  recharge  and  reduced  groundwater  abstraction  because  of  the  increased  canal \nwater  supplies.  The  groundwater  management  component  will  support  improved  groundwater \nand conjunctive-use management and practices. Without the Project, the lowering groundwater \ntable and increasing salinity would mean a high risk to farmer livelihoods in the medium to long \nterm. \n \n30. \nThe Project will improve some of the social infrastructure, such as bridges, as part of the \nR&U of the irrigation structures, and will reduce the exposure of local communities to flooding \nevents  and  the  associated  social  and  economic  damages.  The  livelihoods  of  farming \ncommunities  will  also  improve  through  increased  and  equitable  canal  water  availability  and \nimproved agricultural productivity through improved agricultural practices.  \n \nThe  Project  will  not  have  any  significant  impacts  on  fish,  fisher  communities,  and \n31. \nprotected  ecological  and  archaeological  sites.  However,  monitoring  measures  have  been \nrecommended  to  ensure  that  any  unforeseen  impacts  can  be  identified  and  mitigated  during \nimplementation. \n \n32. \nThe  most  serious  impacts  of  the  Project  will  be  resettlement  of  affected  communities, \nfelling of the canal-side tree plantation, and possible relocation of cultural sites that lie within the \ncanal  right-of-way.  Detailed  action  plans  to  mitigate  these  impacts  guided  by  the  EFA  (and \nresettlement  framework)  will  be  developed  at  the  time  of  detailed  design.  Costs  for  a \nreforestation program are included in the EMP, alternatives to protecting cultural sites such as \nwidening the canal on the opposite bank, providing retaining structures, or using canal lining are \nrecommended in the EIA. \n \n33. \nImplementation  of  and  adherence  to  the  EMP  and  compliance  with  the  EAF  will  be \nnecessary  to  minimize  adverse  impacts  and  maximize  positive  gains.  This  will  be  ensured \nthrough  extensive  consultation  with  all  project  stakeholders,  follow-up  during  construction  to \nidentify and mitigate any impacts that might be unforeseen at this stage, and extensive capacity \ndevelopment for the PIPD. \n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 11         63 \n\nSUMMARY SOCIAL SAFEGUARDS \n\n \n1. \nThe  Punjab  Irrigated  Agriculture  Development  Investment  Program  is  proposed  to  be \nfinanced  by  a  multitranche  finance  facility  (MFF),  with  multiple  loans  to  finance  stand-alone \nprojects or portions of projects. Each project will support rehabilitation and upgrading (R&U) of \nirrigation  and  water  resources  infrastructure  that  is  anticipated  to  require  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement (LAR). The first activity to be supported under the Program will be the Lower Bari \nDoab  Canal  (LBDC)  Improvement  Project  to  be  carried  out  in  East  Punjab.  Under  the  R&U \ncomponent, LBDC civil works are subdivided into two subcomponents: (i) Balloki Barrage R&U; \nand (ii) canal network R&U inclusive of (a) main canal R&U and (b) distribution system R&U. The \nLBDC  civil  works  will  cause  dispersed  impacts  on  land,  houses,  and  businesses;  and  some \nrelocation of people affected.  \n \nA. \n \nThe  LAR  will  follow  Pakistan  law  and  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  policy  on \n2. \ninvoluntary  resettlement,1 and  Operations  Manual  F2  on  Involuntary  Resettlement  (2003).  The \nappraisal  of  the  MFF  and  each  tranche,  and  the  approval  and  implementation  of  each  activity \ninvolving LAR will require the preparation and/or updating of the following documents: \n  \n\nGeneral Procedures \n\na  resettlement  framework  for  the  whole  MFF  to  be  reviewed,  updated,  and \nsubmitted for ADB approval annually and before the preparation of each tranche; \nan  initial  poverty  and  social  assessment  indicating  whether  LAR  impacts  are \nexpected, and if so their type and magnitude for each tranche; and  \na  resettlement  plan  based  on  detailed  design/impact  figures  and  inclusive  of \ncompensation budgets and schedules for each subproject under a loan.2 \n\nThe  appraisal  of  the  MFF  and  of  each  periodic  financing  request  and  the  approval  and \n\n \n3. \nimplementation of each subproject under a loan will follow the following LAR-related conditions: \n \n\nMFF  and  tranche  1  appraisal  conditional  to  preparation  of  (a)  a  resettlement \nframework  for  the  whole  MFF  and  (b)  resettlement  plans  for  the  first  project  1 \ncore-subprojects, both acceptable to ADB;  \nAppraisal  of  other  tranches  conditional  to  (a)  resettlement  framework  review \nand/or  update,  and  (b)  preparation  of  a  resettlement  plan  for  the  projects  and \nsubprojects  presented  with  submission  of  the  loan\u2019s  periodic  financing  request; \nand \nStart  of  all  subproject  civil  works  subject to ADB approval of the resettlement \nplan, however, affected people will be provided certain resettlement entitlements \nsuch  as  land  and  asset  compensation  and  transfer  allowances,  prior  to  their \ndisplacement, dispossession, or restricted access. \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n \n4. \nTo  fit  these  requirements,  the  Punjab  Irrigation  and  Power  Department  (PIPD),  the \nExecuting  Agency,  has  prepared  a  resettlement  framework  and  plans  for  the  core  subprojects \nunder the first loan. \n\n                                                 \n1   ADB. 1995. Involuntary Resettlement. Manila. \n2  Resettlement will be significant where 200 people or more experience major impacts. Major impacts are defined as \ninvolving affected people being physically displaced from housing and/or having more than 10% of their productive, \nincome generating assets lost. Compensation needs to be based on full replacement value. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f64        Appendix 11           \n\nResettlement Framework \n\nB. \n \n5. \nThe  resettlement  framework  lists  the  following  principles:  (i)  LAR  will  be  avoided  or  at \nleast  minimized,  (ii)  compensation  will  guarantee  the  maintenance  of  the  pre-project  living \nstandards of those affected, (iii) people affected will be fully informed/consulted on compensation \noptions,  (iv)    sociocultural  institutions  of  those  affected  will  be  supported  and  used,  (v)  LAR \nprovisions  will  equally  apply  to  women  and  men,  (vi)  lack  of  formal  title  will  not  impede \ncompensation/rehabilitation,  (vii)  particular  attention  will  be  paid  to  households  headed  by \nwomen and vulnerable groups, (viii) LAR will be conceived and executed as an integral part of \nthe Project and LAR budgets will be included in project costs, and (ix) compensation will be fully \nprovided prior to ground leveling and demolition. The framework also covers all issues relevant \nfor the effective conduction of LAR tasks as required by ADB policy and sets the eligibility and \nentitlement provisions outlined in Table A11.  \n \n\nTable A11: Compensation Entitlements Matrix \n\nAsset a \nPermanent \nImpact on \nArable Land \n\nAll land losses \nindependent from \nimpact severity \n\nSpecification \n\nAffected People \n\nFarmer/titleholder \n\nLeaseholder \n(registered or not) \n \n\nSharecroppers \n(registered or not) \n\nAgriculture workers \nlosing their contract \n\nSquatters \n\nFarmer/titleholder \nLeaseholder \n\nSharecroppers \n(registered or not) \n\nSquatters \n\nTitleholder \n\nCompensation Entitlements \nplots \n\ncompensation \n\nin \n\nof \n\n(temporary \n\nimpact)  or \n\nindemnity  corresponding \n\nLand-for-land \nequal \nvalue/productivity or; cash compensation at replacement \ncost  based  on  market  valueb  free  of  taxes,  registration, \nand transfer costs plus 15% compulsory land acquisition \nsurcharge. \nLease  renewal  in  other  plots  of  equal  value/productivity, \nor  cash  equal  to  market  value  of  gross  yield  of  affected \nland  for  the  remaining  lease  years  (up  to  a  3  year \nmaximum). \nCash  compensation  equal  to  market  value  of  the  lost \ntwice \nharvest  share  once \n(permanent impact)  \nCash \nto  salary  (including \nportions in kind) for the remaining part of the agricultural \nyear. \n1  rehabilitation  allowance  equal  to  market  value  of  1 \ngross harvest (in addition to crop compensation) for land \nuse loss.  \n1  severe  impact  allowance  equal  to  market  value  of \ngross harvest of the affected land for 1 year (inclusive of \nwinter and summer crop and additional to standard crop \ncompensation) \n1  severe  impact  allowance  equal  to  market  value  of \nshare  of  harvest \nto  standard  crop \nlost  (additional \ncompensation) \n1  severe  impact  allowance  equal  to  market  value  of \ngross harvest of the affected land for 1 year (inclusive of \nwinter and summer crop and additional to standard crop \ncompensation) \nin \nfor \nLand \nvalue/location to plot lost or cash for affected land at full \nreplacement cost free of taxes, registration, and transfer \ncosts. \n\nland  compensation \n\nin  a  plot  equal \n\nPlot  in  a  public  resettlement  area  or  self-relocation \nallowance \nCash  at  replacement  rates  for  affected  house/structure \nfree  of  salvageable  materials,  depreciation,  and \ntransaction costs; for partial impacts full cash assistance \nto restore structure \n\nRenter/Leaseholder  1\u20133 months allowance \nSquatters \n\nAll relevant people \naffectedc \n \n\nAdditional \nprovisions for \nsevere impacts \n(>10% land loss) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nResidential/ \nCommercial \nLand \n\nHouses and \nStructures \n\n \n\n \n\nCrops \n\nCrops affected \n\nAll people affectedc   Crop compensation in cash at full market rate for harvest \nactually  lost  (winter  or  summer  crop  or  both  as  is  the \ncase) \n\n\fAppendix 11         65 \n\nSpecification \n\nAffected People \n\nCompensation Entitlements \n\nAsset a \nTrees \nBusiness \nEmployment \n\nTrees affected \nTemporary or \npermanent loss of \nbusiness or \nemployment \n\nRelocation \n\nCommunity \nassets \n\nTransport/transition \nlivelihood costs \n \n\nAll people affectedc   Cash compensation will reflect income replacement \nAll people affectedc   Business owner: (i) Cash compensation equal to 1 year \nincome, if loss is permanent; (ii) cash compensation for \nthe period of business interruption, if loss is temporary \nWorker/employees: Indemnity for lost wages for the \nperiod of business interruption up to a maximum of 3 \nmonths  \nProvision of sufficient allowance to cover transport \nexpenses and livelihood expenses for 1 month \nRehabilitation/substitution of affected structures/utilities \n(i.e., mosques, footbridges, roads, schools, health \ncenters) \nEmployment priority in project-related jobs. \n\nAll people affected \nby relocationc \n \n\n \n\nVulnerable \npeople \naffected \na   Other  impacts  so  far  identified  may  occur  in  noncore  subprojects  of  the  first  loans  or  during  core  subproject \nimplementation.

Overall LAR preparation, implementation, financing, and \n6. \ncoordination  responsibility  falls  on  PIPD,  which  will  exercise  these  functions  via  a  project \nmanagement unit (PMU), tasked with general project execution, and the project implementation \nunits (PIUs), tasked with activities at district level. At the  PMU, LAR  will be assigned to a LAR \nunit, handling and monitoring resettlement plan preparation, implementation, approval, and LAR \ncoordination. The LAR unit will be aided by a resettlement team under the PMU consultants, a \nnongovernment  organization,  or  a  national  consultant  hired  for  on-site  impact  surveys  and \nmonitoring  assistance.  The  PMU  will  coordinate  with  the  local  governments,  which  have \njurisdiction on land administration, valuation, and acquisition through two committees: (i) a LAR \nsteering  committee  (provincial)  and  a  LAR  coordination  committee  (district)  ensuring  provincial \nand district coordination. The LAR coordination committee will include members of communities \nwith  people  affected  and  their  representatives,  and  will  provide  facilitation  both  during  LAR \nimplementation and in the solution of complaints and grievances. Provincial LAR functions rest \nwith  the  Board  of  Revenue;  district  functions  with  the  district  collector  office  and  the  land \nacquisition  collector.  Minor  agents,  like  the  patwari,  (records  keepers),  will  identify  and  verify \ntitles.  Compensation  of  assets  other  than  land  (buildings,  crops,  etc.)  or  income  rehabilitation \nfalls  on  the  relevant  district  department.  ADB  clearance  of  category  B  resettlement  plans  will \nhandled  by  a  resettlement  specialist  hired  at  ADB\u2019s  Pakistan  Resident  Mission.3 Category  A \nprojects will be cleared at ADB headquarters. \n  \nintense \n7. \nconsultation  with  those  affected.  As  an  appraisal  condition,  the  resettlement  framework  and \nrelevant  resettlement  plans  in  English  will  be  disclosed  on  the  ADB  website,  while  the \nresettlement  framework  and  resettlement  plans  in  local  language  will  be  disclosed  in  the \ncommunities of those affected. \n \n8. \nGrievance  Procedures.  Individuals  affected  will  first  lodge  a  complaint  with  the  land \nacquisition collector. If settlement is not reached within 15 days, the complaint will be sent to the \nPMU. If the grievance is still not settled within 1 month, the people affected can seek redress at \n\nDisclosure/Public  Consultation.  Resettlement  plan \n\ntasks  will \n\ninvolve \n\n                                                 \n3   To be confirmed prior to submission of first resettlement plan or optional approval mechanisms agreeable to RSDD \n\nwill be adopted.  \n\n \n\n\f66        Appendix 11           \n\nthe  appropriate  court.  The  LAR  coordination  committee  composed  by  senior  members  of  the \ncommunities  of  people  affected  and  by  their  elected  representatives  will  assist  the  individuals \naffected in these cases.   \n\n \n\nMonitoring and Evaluation. The PMU will internally monitor and report to PIPD on LAR \n9.   \nimplementation.  PIPD  will  report  to  ADB  quarterly.  PIPD  will  assign  external  monitoring  to  an \nindependent  agency  and  external  monitoring  reports  will  be  submitted  to  ADB  twice  a  year.  At \nthe  end  of  project  implementation,  the  independent  monitoring  agency  will  carry  out  a  general \nevaluation of LAR implementation. \n \n10. \nthat  each \nresettlement plan will detail LAR budgets and provide clear schedules linking LAR tasks with the \ninitiation of civil works. \n \nC. \n\nFinances  and  Schedules.  The \n\nIndigenous Peoples Issues  \n\nframework  prescribes \n\nresettlement \n\nNo impacts on indigenous peoples are expected as the Program will be implemented in \n\n12. \nPunjab where no resident population fits the ADB definition of indigenous peoples. \n\nSpecific Land Acquisition and Resettlement Plans  \n\nD. \n \nTwo  core-subprojects  with  LAR  have  been  prepared  as  a  condition  for  tranche  1 \n11. \nappraisal, namely: Distributary System 15-L and the Main Canal Rehabilitation Works at Shaiwal \ntown  (Shaiwal  town  subproject).  For  both,  a  resettlement  plan  fitting  ADB\u2019s  policy  and \nresettlement framework requirements has been prepared.  \n \nThe  15-L  Distributary  system  will  affect  1.920  m2  ha  of  residential  land  occupied  by  15 \n12. \nhouses, 38 commercial establishments, 36 sheds, 41 kiosks, 13 stalls, and 23 minor structures, \nwhich  will  be  compensated  at  replacement  cost.  As  all  these  buildings  are  built  on  public \npremises,  land  will  be  compensated  through  land-for-land  mechanisms.  A  total  of  1,400  m2  of \nland has been earmarked in various areas of the Project to be distributed as replacement plots. \nIn addition to private assets the Project will cause the relocation of two mosques and require the \ncompensation  of  two  tubewells  and  three  hand  pumps.  In  all  112  families  are  affected  (2,645 \nindividuals), of these 15 families will have to be resettled. LAR costs are assessed at $220,000.  \n \nThe  Shaiwal  Town  subproject  will  affect  6,116  m2  of  residential  land  occupied  by  25 \n13. \nhouses, 27 commercial establishments, 13 sheds, 9 kiosks, 14 stalls, and 21 minor structures, \nwhich will be compensated at replacement cost. These buildings are built on public land, which \nwill  be  compensated  with  earmarked  replacement  plots  for  a  total  of  7,714  m2  and  located  in \nvarious areas of the city along the main canal. In addition to private assets, the Project will cause \nthe  relocation  of  one  mosque,  two  Imam  Barghas,  and  one  shrine;  and  will  require  the \ncompensation  of  several  electrical  and  telephone  poles.  In  all  108  families  are  affected  (867 \nindividuals), of these 25 will have to be resettled. LAR costs are assessed at $305,000. \n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\f", "author_pages": [" \n", "CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 15 November 2006) \n", "Currency Unit\nPR1.00\n$1.00\n", "\u2013 \n= \n= \n", "Pakistan rupee/s (PRs) \n$0.0164 \nPRs60.8 \n", "ABBREVIATIONS \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "Asian Development Bank \nAsian Development Fund \narea water board \nenvironmental assessment framework \nenvironmental impact assessment \nenvironmental monitoring plan \nfinancial framework agreement \nDirectorate of On-Farm Water Management \ngross domestic product \ngeographic information system \ninitial environmental examination \nirrigation management unit \ninvestment program planning and management unit \nJapan Bank for International Cooperation \nland acquisition and resettlement \nLower Bari Doab Canal \nLower Bari Doab Canal Improvement Project \nLower Chenab Canal \nmultitranche financing facility  \nmanagement information system \nNational Drainage Program \noperation and maintenance \non-farm water management \nperiodic financing request \nPunjab Irrigated Agriculture Investment Program \nPunjab irrigated agriculture project preparation facility \nPunjab Irrigation and Drainage Authority \nPunjab Irrigation and Power Department \nPunjab Irrigation Sector Reform Program \nproject implementation unit \nproject management office \nproject management unit \nproject steering committee \nrehabilitation and upgrading \n", " \nWEIGHTS AND MEASURES \n", "cumecs \nkm \nha \nmm \n", "cubic meters per second \nkilometer \nhectare \nmillimeter \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", " \n", "ADB \nADF \nAWB \nEAF \nEIA \nEMP \nFFA \nDOFWM \nGDP \nGIS \nIEE \nIMU \nIPPMU \nJBIC \nLAR \nLBDC \nLBDCIP \nLCC \nMFF \nMIS \nNDP \nO&M \nOFWM \nPFR \nPIAIP \nPIAPPF \nPIDA \nPIPD \nPISRP \nPIU \nPMO \nPMU \nPSC \nR&U \n", " \n", " \n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n", " \n \n \n \n \n", "abiana \nbiraderi \nconjunctive use \n", "rabi \nkhal panchayat \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "irrigation service fee  \nclan \nuse  of  surface  water  and  groundwater  to  meet  water  needs  in \nthe same geographic area \ncrop growing season from about October to March \n", "\u2013 \n  water user association based on a common irrigation field outlet \n", "kharif \n", "from the canal \ncrop growing season from about April to September \n", "\u2013 \n", "GLOSSARY \n \n", "NOTES \n", "The fiscal year (FY) of the Government of Pakistan ends on 30 June. \n", "In this report, \"$\" refers to US dollars. \n", " \n \n \n", " \n \n", " \n \n", " \n", "(i) \n", "(ii) \n \n \n", "Vice President \nDirector General \nDirector \n", " \nTeam leader \nTeam members \n \n \n \n", "L.
