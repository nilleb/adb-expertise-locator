THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed grant \nto the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan for the COVID-19 Vaccine Support Project under the Asia \nPacific Vaccine Access Facility (APVAX). \n \n2.  The project will provide the Government of Afghanistan with urgently needed and flexible \nfinancing for coronavirus disease (COVID-19) vaccine procurement and logistics, and capacity \nstrengthening activities through the APVAX.1 Afghanistan has met all APVAX access criteria \n(Table 1). The project investment component under the APVAX will be utilized. The project will \nsupport  the  implementation  of  the  National  Plan  for  COVID-19  Vaccination  in  Afghanistan \n(NPCVA) in line with the fragile and conflict-affected situations (FCAS) approach and Strategy \n2030 of the Asian Development Bank (ADB).2 \n \nTable 1: Compliance with Access Criteria of the Asia Pacific Vaccine Access Facility \nAccess Criteria  ADB Staff Assessment \nDemonstrated adverse  The real GDP is estimated to contract by 5.0% in 2020 compared to the pre-COVID-19 \nimpact of the COVID-19  projection of 3.0% growth. The unemployment rate is projected to increase from 23.9% \npandemic  in 2019 to 37.9% in 2020. The poverty rate increased drastically in 2020, with 61%\u201373% \n  of people living below the national poverty line of about $1 per day\u2014a significant increase \nfrom 55% in 2016/2017. \nCompleted needs  A needs assessment conducted by the MOF, the MOPH, and development partners \nAssessment  identified gaps. The NPCVA addresses the findings of readiness assessments conducted \nby WHO and UNICEF (VIRAT) and by the World Bank (VRAF).  \nNational vaccination  The MOPH has developed the NPCVA in consultation with ministries, institutions, \nallocation plan  provinces, and partners. The NPCVA is aligned with the WHO SAGE on global COVID-\n19 policies and strategies. It (i) clearly identifies vulnerable groups first; (ii) provides a \nfinancing plan to vaccinate up to 60% of the population; and (iii) outlines implementation \narrangements, cold chain systems, and reporting and monitoring systems.  \nIncremental medical  The NPCVA describes the collection and safe disposal of all medical sharps waste and \nwaste management  syringes in safety boxes, to centralized health facility for safe destruction or sterilization \nplan  in WHO-approved facilities.

The project supports the National Emergency Response Plan for Coronavirus 2020 and \nwill contribute to limiting the impact of COVID-19, which has resulted in additional 1.9 million\u20136.0 \nmillion people falling into poverty in 2020.3 It is an integral part of the development partner \npackage and will help the government\u2019s efforts to mitigate the health, social, and economic \nimpacts  of  the  pandemic  and  strengthen  the  country\u2019s  immunization  systems.  It  will  also \ncomplement efforts to contain the COVID-19 pandemic and foster economic growth in the Central \nAsia Regional Economic Cooperation (CAREC) region. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n4.  Status of the pandemic and country context. The World Health Organization (WHO) \ndeclared COVID-19 a global pandemic on 11 March 2020. The first case in Afghanistan was \nconfirmed on 22 February 2020, prompting the government to implement control measures. \nFollowing a first wave in May\u2013June 2020, with a peak of 1,231 reported COVID-19 cases on 17 \nJune 2020, a second wave started in late 2020.4 As of 25 March 2021, the government reported \n56,226 cases and 2,467 deaths of COVID-19.5 The extent of the pandemic is underreported in \nthe country because of limited testing capacity. The reported case fatality rate is 4.4%. Only 0.2% \nof cases have been treated in intensive care units because of limited bed capacity.6 \n \n5.  Afghanistan is classified as an FCAS country and faces many challenges, including violent \nconflict, security issues, political instability, economic problems, large returnee and displaced \npopulations, and high levels of poverty and food insecurity. The country faces risks from disasters, \nand some parts are difficult to access because of security issues. As a landlocked country it is \ndependent  on  trade  transit  arrangements  with  neighboring  countries.  These  challenges, \ncombined with developing institutions and limited administrative capacity, have affected the \ngovernment\u2019s response to the COVID-19 pandemic. \n \n6.  Economic cost. While the pre-shock economic growth was already relatively low, the \npandemic had a substantial negative economic impact because of business closures, disruptions \nin supply chains, a downturn in trade and remittances, and a drop in consumer demand. The \nAsian Development Outlook estimated a real gross domestic product (GDP) contraction of 5.0% \nin 2020.7 Afghanistan\u2019s exports are estimated to decline by 35.4% in 2020 and imports by 2.4%. \nThe fiscal budget deficit (excluding grants and budget support loans) was projected to widen from \n$2.65 billion (13.9% of GDP) in 2019 to $3.96 billion (20.8% of GDP) in 2020. \n \n7.  Impact on poor and vulnerable groups. The COVID-19 pandemic was projected to \nincrease the unemployment rate (including in the informal sector) from 23.9% in 2019 to 37.9% \nin 2020.8 This was compounded by the increase in food prices, housing, and health services, and \ndramatic declines in remittances inflows, which were projected to have more than halved in 2020 \n \n3  World Bank. 2020.

The World Bank estimated that the poverty rate increased drastically in 2020, with \n61%\u201373% of people living below the national poverty line of about $1 per day; a significant \nincrease from 55% in 2016/2017.9 The pandemic has had a disproportionate effect on the poor \nand vulnerable families, including returnees and internally displaced people.10 \n \n8.  Impact on gender. The COVID-19 pandemic has rolled back the gains made on women's \nrights, exacerbating gender inequalities, leading to increased violence against women and girls, \nand further limiting women's access to critical services and resources to respond to the crisis.11 \nWomen and girls already had limited access to critical health care, including maternal and child \nhealth care, particularly in rural areas where 75% of the population live. In Afghanistan, only 15% \nof nurses and 2% of medical doctors are women, because of rigid gender norms limiting women\u2019s \nroles outside the home as well as their employment opportunities. This critically limits women and \ngirls\u2019 access to health care, including COVID-19-related treatment, as some women and girls may \nnot want to be treated by male doctors or health workers. It is crucial to increase the number of \nfemale vaccinators to ensure that women are not left out from COVID-19 vaccination. \n \n9.  Impact on the health system. Although Afghanistan has achieved notable improvements \nin its health system, it lags significantly behind the rest of the Middle East and Central Asia region \nin terms of services and key health indicators.12 During the peak of the pandemic, the health \nsystem was unable to provide (i) adequate testing and protection to health care workers and (ii) \nacceptable clinical management to patients. Hundreds of health care workers were infected with \nCOVID-19 and dozens have died.13 Many patients have died because of a shortage of oxygen \nsupply, and only one-third of public hospital beds are designated for COVID-19 patients, with very \nfew in intensive care units. Given these, a surge in severe COVID-19 cases in hospitals will disrupt \nmedical services beyond COVID-19 patients management (footnote 6). A vaccination program is \ncritical to flatten the COVID-19 case curve to ensure health services are not overwhelmed. \n \n10.  Initial measures introduced by the government to control the pandemic. The Ministry \nof  Public  Health  (MOPH),  in  coordination  with  relevant  ministries,  prepared  the  National \nEmergency Response Plan for Coronavirus in 2020, which was based on the response plans of \nWHO and the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF).14 The President of Afghanistan chairs \nthe COVID-19 national response coordinating committee (NRCC) of ministries and partners to \nprovide oversight and guide and coordinate the pandemic response, supported by multisector \n \n9  World Bank. 2020.

ADB provided a $40 million emergency assistance grant \n(EAG), under which (i) 8 hospitals are being constructed (adding 600 new beds) and expected for \ncompletion by May 2021, and (ii) medicines and medical equipment were delivered and oxygen \nconcentrators distributed to all provinces in the second half of 2020.15 The remaining 12 hospitals \nwill be constructed or rehabilitated by the end of 2021 (adding 550 new beds). The World Bank \nprovided $146 million, and the European Union provided \u20ac117 million, in addition to other grants. \nADB, with a $100 million grant through its COVID-19 Active Response and Expenditure Support \n(CARES) program,16 the World Bank, and the International Monetary Fund have also provided \nassistance aimed at reducing the overall social and economic impacts of COVID-19.17 \n \n11.  Lessons. The project\u2019s design is informed by the best practices learned from recent \nprojects. For the EAG, the majority of procurement was done through WHO and UNICEF; this \narrangement  ensured that  supplies  were  of  good  quality  and  has  helped  mitigate  several \nprocurement risks. ADB\u2019s support in strengthening the project management capacity of the \nMOPH proved to be essential for implementation of the EAG. The capacity strengthening process \nrequires a long-term commitment from ADB and should be continued under the project. \n \n12.  Needs assessment. The high transmission scenario for Afghanistan, projecting 740,000 \ninfected persons seems likely, with at least 46,000 inpatients and 7,208 deaths.18 It was estimated \nthat not having access to COVID-19 vaccines would cost low-income countries $28 billion\u2013$200 \nbillion of their combined GDP.19 The impact of vaccination will depend on the maintenance of \ncontrol measures, public hesitancy for vaccination, and possible new viral strains.20 While the \nthreshold of the population to be vaccinated against COVID-19 to induce herd immunity or the \ncapacity of any vaccine so far to reduce the transmission of the virus are not yet known, a degree \nof \u201cfunctional immunity\u201d can be met. 21 Functional immunity corresponds to a level of protection \nthat will not necessarily prevent one from getting infected but will drastically reduce the risk of \ncontracting a severe form of the disease or dying. Protecting selected groups, whether they are \nmore vulnerable or essential to the continuation of prioritized activity in the country, will reduce \nthe burden of medical services in hospitals, reduce mortality because of COVID-19, and maintain \nessential public services and production capacity. The target is 60% (approximately 23.3 million \npeople) of the total population (excluding those below 18 years old) to reach this goal. \n \n13.  The Afghanistan public health system is capable of implementing a public vaccination \ncampaign and has delivered as many as 14 million vaccinations per annum.22 In 31 of the 34 \nprovinces, nongovernment organizations (NGOs) are delivering public health services through \nservice provider contracts.23 The National Expanded Program on Immunization (NEPI) has \n \n15 ADB. 2020.

Financing, procurement, and logistics systems are \nestablished and monitored. The cold chain system is being improved. Potential hurdles, which \nmainly concern rural areas, include local leaders\u2019 buy-in, public hesitancy, availability of female \nstaff, and staff security. Alternative vaccination strategies have been developed for remote \nlocations, such as using mobile clinics and providing incentives for community vaccination drives. \n \n14.  National Plan for COVID-19 Vaccination in Afghanistan. The MOPH has developed \nthe NPCVA in consultation with ministries, institutions, provinces, and partners.24 The program \naims to vaccinate at least 20% of the population by December 2021, and another 40% in 2022, \nsubject to vaccine availability. The prioritized 20% (7.78 million people) are ranked in the following \norder: (i) health workers, (ii) teachers, (iii) security personnel, (iv) prisoners, (v) people with \ncomorbidities, (vi) people over 50 years of age, (vii) nomadic people, (viii) internally displaced \npeople, (ix) returnees from countries with high COVID-19 prevalence, (x) government employees \nwho are working with crowds, and (xi) people living in urban slums and others for emergency \nuse. Children below 18 years old will not be vaccinated. Vaccinating pregnant women will depend \non clinical trials and political support. \n \n15.  The  NRCC  has  been  extended  to  include  COVID-19  vaccination.  The  MOPH  has \nestablished a strong coordination structure, including the High-Level Health Program Oversight \nCommittee (HLHPOC) chaired by the minister of public health, which brings together key \ndevelopment  partners  including  ADB;  the  World  Bank;  United  Nations  agencies;  and \nrepresentatives from civil society, private sector, and the MOF. The HLHPOC is responsible for \nCOVID-19 vaccine rollout, primarily through the NEPI, and provides programmatic directions and \ncoordination among all involved ministries, provinces, and partners. The NPCVA provides a \nbudget and financing plan to provide up to 60% of the population with COVID-19 vaccination at \na cost of $319 million. Afghanistan is a beneficiary of the COVID-19 Vaccines Global Access \n(COVAX) Advance Market Commitment (AMC) mechanism through the COVAX initiative led by \nGavi, the Vaccine Alliance (GAVI).25 As such, it will receive vaccines and ancillary items for \nvaccinating 16%\u201320% of the population. Several vaccines are being considered for emergency \napproval by the Afghanistan National Regulatory Authority.26 \n \n16.  The MOPH and partners have made detailed plans for the cold chain system to make \nvaccines available in 2,227 health facilities. Storage, transportation capacity, and quality control \nof vaccines are also to be increased. Vaccination will be delivered through the NEPI structure and \nstaff for routine immunization as well as medical facilities. To address a gender-based challenge \nfor women who will be vaccinated, MOPH will ensure that 1,000 female vaccinators will be \nrecruited among the 2,000 additional vaccinators to be hired, in addition to the existing 4,454 \nvaccinators, half of whom are women.

A training plan for vaccinators has been prepared. Special arrangements are being \nmade to ensure the safety of health staff in remote locations and areas controlled by anti-\ngovernment elements, including obtaining letters of guarantee/clearances. Innovative options \nmay have to be considered to improve access (e.g., mobile clinics), and to overcome vaccine \nhesitancy (e.g., incentives). For every target group, a specific implementation strategy has been \nprepared, with dedicated means of identification implemented with partners.27 \n \n17.  The NPCVA has plans, protocols, and reporting requirements to (i) inform, manage, and \nscreen potential recipients of the vaccine; and (ii) ensure the quality of vaccines, vaccination, and \nhow to handle adverse events following immunization. The MOPH has strengthened its system \n(based on District Health Information Software 2) for registration, data collection, and reporting.28 \nPatients will be identified based on a procedure detailed in the NPCVA. The MOPH plans to roll \nout smart paper technology to provide real-time data from the health facilities and use data \ncollected by partner supervisors. Tracking of vaccination and performance monitoring will be \nimplemented by a third-party monitoring firm (Acasus), in coordination with donors.29 There is a \nstrong emphasis in the NPCVA on accountability, transparency, and monitoring. The NPCVA \ncovers a community engagement and communication plan, including a wide range of methods \ntailored to different target groups.30 It describes the procedures in place based on Afghanistan\u2019s \nHealth Care Waste Management Plan validated in 2018 for handling and disposal of medical \nwaste.31  \n \n18.  Development partner coordination. ADB\u2019s proposed grant of $50 million will support \nprocurement and transportation of vaccines and capacity strengthening of the MOPH, and will \nfully complement assistance of other development partners. The MOPH is coordinating the health \nsector response with all partners\u2014with WHO, UNICEF, and the World Bank taking a co-leading \nrole. The first round of vaccines for 16%\u201320% of the population will be financed through the \nCOVAX  AMC  mechanism  with  $84  million.  This  funding  will  also  support  distribution, \nstrengthening of cold chains, provision of technical assistance, and capacity building. The World \nBank is processing a project of $113 million which includes $50 million in cofinancing from the \nAfghanistan Reconstruction Trust Fund that will support vaccine procurement, other areas \ncovered by GAVI, and delivery of vaccines to the population.32 Key support will also be provided \nby UNICEF and WHO, which will support procurement and distribution of vaccines, training, and \nservice delivery and administration of vaccines to the population; and other partners.33 The \nvaccination process started in February 2021, and GAVI delivered the first batch of 468,000 \ndoses of AstraZeneca vaccine produced by the Serum Institute of India, on 8 March  2021. \n \n \n27 People living in camps for internally displaced people aged 30\u201350 years will be vaccinated by additional vaccinators \nusing a mobile strategy, and their identification will be managed by the International Organization for Migration, \nUnited Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, and the Ministry of Returnees and Repatriation. \n28 District Health Information Software 2 (DHIS2) is an opensource health management information system. \n29 Acasus.

Acasus will provide real-time reports by health facility, which can be aggregated to provincial and \nnational levels to help ensure that vaccinations reach the delivery points in the right quantities and quality. \n30 For example, mass media (TV and/or radio) campaigns, media workshops and monitoring, and social media. \nDeveloping IPC/I skills of frontline workers and media representative\u2019s knowledge of the vaccine. \n31 The NPCVA provides guidance for (i) segregation according to color coding for different types of biomedical waste; \n(ii) collection using different types of containers; (iii) designated storage locations within health care facilities; (iv) safe \ntransportation for treatment (on-site and off-site); (v) use of personal safety devices mandatory for all personnel \nhandling waste; and (vi) adequate treatment and disposal of syringes, needles, glass vials, and other materials. \n32 Development Coordination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n33 The Government of India has confirmed a donation of 500,000 doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine manufactured by \nthe Serum Institute of India, which will be used for medical workers and teachers. \n ", "7 \nB. Project Description\n19. Impact and Outcome. The project is aligned with the following impacts: (i) vulnerable \ngroups are protected from COVID-19 (footnote 25); and (ii) the spread of severe acute respiratory \nsyndrome coronavirus 2 is reduced, and confidence of citizens is restored.34 The project is \naligned with the following outcome: priority populations vaccinated against COVID-19.35 The \nproject outputs are described below.\n20. The government requested ADB to support its COVID-19 vaccination program. Following \nthe guidance provided in Appendix 4 of the APVAX policy paper (footnote 1), the project \ninvestment component will be utilized. This approach will provide the flexibility needed to respond \nto the challenging operating environment in Afghanistan.\n21. Output 1: COVID-19 vaccines procured and delivered to designated points. The \nproject will provide financing to procure vaccines through the COVAX AMC facility with UNICEF \nsupport, as well as procurement of vaccines by UNICEF outside of the COVAX AMC facility, if \nrequired. A minimum of 6 million doses of COVID-19 will be delivered to the national store in \nKabul and regional and provincial centers. The expenditure items will include (i) vaccines that \nmeet any of the eligibility criteria of the APVAX policy paper,36 including advance payments; (ii) \nsafety boxes, syringes, and other items required for the administration of the vaccines; and (iii) \ninternational and national logistics and related services required for the transportation of vaccines \nfrom the place of purchase to designated delivery points. UNICEF will also provide transportation \nsupport from the national store in Kabul to regional and provincial vaccine store centers and to \nother designated points of delivery to support the overall COVID-19 vaccine rollout under the \nNPCVA, including for vaccines procured by other development partners (such as GAVI through \nthe COVAX AMC) that meet the APVAX eligibility criteria (footnote 36). Prior to the disbursement \nof the grant proceeds, the MOPH shall submit to ADB purchase agreements for the vaccines that \ncomply with the APVAX vaccine eligibility criteria.\n22. Output 2: Vaccine program implementation capacity strengthened. This output will \nsupport strengthening the capacity of the MOPH to effectively and efficiently manage vaccine \nimplementation. The output will provide consultant support to strengthen the MOPH\u2019s capacity \nrelated to planning, communications, coordination, and implementation at the national and \nprovincial levels. The project will also support the strengthening of the project implementation \nunit (PIU) within the MOPH, which is also used for the EAG (footnote 15), by providing additional \nconsultant support. All capacity strengthening activities will ensure women staff\u2019s participation. \nTechnical trainings will include tailored gender sensitivity sessions to ensure that vaccines are \nadministered to women in a culturally sensitive manner. Community campaigns to promote the \ndemand for vaccines from the targeted population groups will set targets for women to be \nreached. Under this output, a performance auditing firm will be engaged to ensure that ADB-\nfinanced vaccines are delivered as per the NPCVA, and a waste management firm will be \nengaged to provide the technical support and capacity building for waste disposal. The capacity \nstrengthening activities will be coordinated with other regional technical assistance.37\n34 Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 is the virus that causes COVID-19; ADB. 2020.

", "8 \n23. Value addition. The pandemic has had significant social and economic impacts on the\nAfghan population. ADB has added value in terms of its infrastructure and administrative expertise\nand in-depth understanding of the local development process and is considered a trusted partner.\nADB\u2019s overall support for the government\u2019s response to COVID-19 is holistic. It involves an\nexpansion of ADB\u2019s portfolio to the health sector through the $40 million EAG and provision of\n$100 million in budget support (through the CARES program), covering treatment in hospitals\nthrough the EAG, prevention with the APVAX, and mitigation of socioeconomic impact through\nthe CARES program (footnote 16). ADB has established monitoring mechanisms under the\nCARES program, on which this project builds for efficiently monitoring its implementation. The\nsupport for COVID-19 vaccines is essential for overcoming the pandemic and moving toward\neconomic recovery. ADB\u2019s support will ensure that internationally reputed and medically certified\nsafe and high-quality vaccines are made available to the Afghan people. Furthermore, given\nAfghanistan\u2019s location at the crossroads of Central Asia, the project will generate significant\nregional public goods and complement efforts to contain the COVID-19 pandemic and foster\ngrowth in the CAREC region, through addressing pandemic risks and cross-border health threats.\n3. Summary Cost Estimates and Financing Plan\n24. The  project  is  estimated  to  cost  $52  million  (Table  2).  Detailed  cost  estimates  by\nexpenditure category and financier are included in the project administration manual (PAM).38\nThe major expenditure items are the purchase and delivery of COVID-19 vaccines, the supply of\nother ancillary items required for the administration of the vaccines, international and national\nlogistics and related services required for the transportation of vaccines to designated delivery\npoints, and consulting services for capacity development of the MOPH.\n Table 2: Summary Cost Estimates \n($ million) \nItem  Amounta \nA.

Implementation Arrangements\n26. Implementation  arrangements  are  summarized  in  Table  4  and  detailed  in the  PAM\n(footnote 38). The executing agency will be the MOPH. The deputy minister for policy and\nplanning, MOPH will serve as the project coordinator, with support from the NEPI, MOPH, which\nwill coordinate vaccination rollout and will be responsible and accountable for distribution and\nvaccine administration to groups identified by the NPCVA. The Grant and Service Contract\nManagement Unit, MOPH will support the NEPI Division on the procurement and administrative\nside,  including  maintaining  robust  inventory management  and  controls  and monitoring  and\ntracking systems, while the Sehatmandi Coordination Office (SCO), MOPH, will coordinate project\nactivities with all stakeholders.39 Project oversight will be provided through the HLHPOC, which\nwill  meet  regularly  to  review  the  project\u2019s  progress  and  ensure  coordinated  efforts  by  all\nstakeholders (para. 15 and footnote 2).\n27. The MOPH has established the National Immunization Technical Advisory Group as well\nas technical working groups in operation, cold chain, communication, surveillance, adverse\nevents monitoring, and training committees to oversee specific aspects of the NPCVA. The\nnational-level committees are supported by technical committees at the provincial levels, which\n(i) are led by the Provincial Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI) Management Team and\nregional EPI management teams, and (ii) bring all relevant partners on the ground. All committees\nwill meet regularly to ensure timely implementation of the NPCVA. The delivery of the vaccines\nto the population will be done through 2,227 existing EPI centers with 4,454 vaccinators and 2,000\nadditional vaccinators. The MOPH\u2019s capacity will be augmented with additional staff (consultants)\nto ensure adequate inventory management and controls and monitoring and tracking systems.\n28. UNICEF will be engaged through direct contracting as a turnkey procurement agent to\nhandle all aspects of goods and logistics procurement in accordance with the ADB Procurement\nPolicy  (2017,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)  and  the  Procurement  Regulations  for  ADB\nBorrowers (2017, as amended from time to time).40 UNICEF will also be engaged to provide\ntransportation and logistics services to designated points to support the overall COVID-19\n39 The SCO of the MOPH oversees implementation of the World Bank\u2019s Sehatmandi Project. It also oversees the \nimplementation of the ADB EAG.

", "10 \nvaccine rollout under the NPCVA, including vaccines procured by other development partners, \nwhich will be carried out in accordance with UNICEF\u2019s Supply Manual.41 Value for money will be \nachieved through utilizing a procurement agent with relationships across all major supply chains \nfor the vaccines, ancillary items, and logistics which matches the intent to need to deliver fast, \nsafe  and  high-quality  vaccines.  UNICEF  has the  required resources  to  immediately  begin \nproviding services either through or outside of COVAX and is also best positioned to navigate the \nquickly evolving vaccine market to ensure availability of fast, safe, and high-quality vaccines. \nUNICEF is also well positioned in Afghanistan to handle in-country logistics, and UNICEF\u2019s cold \nchain experience is critical for the safe handling of vaccines. \n29. UNICEF will be engaged to strengthen the capacity of the MOPH to manage vaccine\nimplementation. Recruitment of national consultants to strengthen the implementation capacity\nof the PIU and MOPH will be handled through UNICEF (footnote 41) or the government\u2019s\nrecruitment system.42 Recruitment for consulting services for firms and supply of the office\nfurniture and equipment for MOPH will be handled in line with the ADB Procurement Policy and\nthe Procurement Regulations for ADB Borrowers.

DUE DILIGENCE\n31. ADB\u2019s standard due diligence requirements for processing sovereign operations have\nbeen applied.\nA. Economic Analysis\n32. The COVID-19 pandemic is both a health and an economic crisis, generating loss of lives\nand major economic downturn arising from the introduction of containment measures that restrict\neconomic  activities  and  a  wider  economy-wide  slowdown  in  investment  and  international\ntrade. Averting further loss and paving the way for recovery from economic stagnation will require\ncomprehensive vaccination combined with other effective suppression measures. While the\nreduction of morbidity and mortality of vaccinated vulnerable populations will result quickly in a\nreduction of the stress on hospital activities, the achievement of functional immunity (footnote 21)\nagainst COVID-19 through the vaccination program, in addition to natural infection, will result in\nsustainable reduction of mortality and morbidity. It will contribute to setting the economy back on\na normal development track by encouraging the resumption of economic activities, including\nproduction, investment, and trade, and will have positive cross-border spillover effects.", "12 \nB. Governance and Anticorruption\n33. A governance risk assessment was carried out in line with ADB\u2019s Second Governance\nand Anticorruption Action Plan.43 The government is committed to improving the quality of\ngovernance,44 and it undertook several governance initiatives during 2016\u20132019.45 However, a\npolitical risk analysis undertaken in 2020 highlighted the likely scenario of continued political and\nsecurity risks, with no final peace deal reached between the state and the Taliban before 2025.46\nA  prolonged  government  formation  under  a  tumultuous  peace  process  and  a  weak  legal\nenforcement regime imply that the political and regulatory risks are likely to persist, and proposed\nreforms are unlikely to fully materialize with corruption persisting in public bodies and state\ndecision-making.47 The government\u2019s effectiveness is further constrained by poor links between\nthe national and subnational levels of governance, combined with institutional and human\ncapacity challenges. To mitigate the risks, the general scope of procurement will rely upon\nUNICEF performing the role of a procurement agent to carry out turnkey procurement and\nlogistics  services  for  vaccines  and  ancillary  items.  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as\namended to date) was explained to and discussed with the government and MOPH. The specific\npolicy requirements and corruption mitigation measures are described in the PAM. All vaccines\nmust be either on the WHO Emergency Use Listing or WHO prequalified.48 ADB will provide\nfinancing for vaccine procurement only once the APVAX vaccine eligibility criteria have been met\n(footnote 36). All cold chain equipment\u2014from the national to the service delivery levels\u2014is WHO\nprequalified.\nC. Environment and Social Safeguards\n34. In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project\u2019s safeguard\ncategories are as follows.\n35. Environment  (category  C).  The  availability  of  COVID-19  vaccines  will  result  in  a\ntemporary increase of immunization waste (e.g., used syringes, needles, personal protective\nequipment) at service points. Hence, minimal environmental impacts are envisaged, as this waste\nwill be disposed following the national medical health care waste management plan, which was\nreviewed and confirmed to be adequate.49\n36. Involuntary resettlement and indigenous peoples (category C). The project does not\nentail any physical intervention to cause any involuntary resettlement and indigenous peoples\nimpacts.\n43 ADB. 2006.

The project supports poverty alleviation with measures to safeguard the health of citizens,\nmaintain jobs, and ensure equal access to vaccines to the poor and vulnerable people.50\n38. The project is categorized effective gender mainstreaming.51 It addresses the need to\nprotect those on the COVID-19 front line, such as health workers (including community health\nworkers) and teachers (about 40% of whom are women), by prioritizing these population groups\nfor vaccination. Also included in the prioritized groups for vaccination are nomadic groups,\ninternally displaced persons, and those living in slums, about 49% of whom are women. The\nproject will collect sex-disaggregated data on the targeted population groups and information on\nthe cultural appropriateness of vaccination sites for monitoring of the vaccination plan. MOPH\nstaff and consultants, 30% of whom are women, from the central, regional, and provincial offices\nwill be trained on the effective procurement and management of the vaccines in a gender-\nsensitive way. The project endeavors to create a gender-sensitive vaccination environment by\nincluding gender-inclusive provisions in the local operational plans on vaccine distribution, such\nas providing separate vaccination areas for women, training female health workers who will\ncommunicate safety procedures to women after vaccination and in between doses, and using\ngender-fair messages in community-targeted campaigns to raise vaccine demand, among others.\nE. Financial Due Diligence\n39. Financial management assessment concluded that the overall pre-mitigated financial\nmanagement risk of the project is substantial owing in part to the risk associated with inherited\ncountry security risks, weak institutional governance, a weak internal control system, and limited\nexperience with ADB-funded projects. To address these weaknesses, the following mitigation\nmeasures,  as  presented  in  the  financial  management  assessment  time-bound  financial\nmanagement action plan, were discussed and agreed with the MOPH: (i) financial management\nconsultants will be engaged to support the MOPH, (ii) training will be provided by ADB to MOPH\nPIU staff on ADB financial management and disbursement guidelines and policies, (iii) PIU staff\nwith prior ADB or World Bank project experience will be deployed, (iv) an information system to\ntrack vaccines and monitor implementation will be operational, (v) internal controls and financial\nreporting will be strengthened as recommended in the financial management action plan, and (vi)\nindependent auditors will conduct both project financial reporting and performance audits.\n40. Basic public health services are provided free of charge. A project financial viability\nassessment was not undertaken since project outputs are not meant to produce cost recovery.\nThe fiscal sustainability of the country\u2019s vaccination program is at risk because of the country\u2019s\nfiscal limitations, and so is the national health care system, which fully relies on the support of\ndevelopment partners.52 There is a high probability that funding from partners will continue.\nF.
