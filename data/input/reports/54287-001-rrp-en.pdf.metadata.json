THE PROPOSAL\n1. I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan of\nup to $40,000,000 (or its yuan equivalent) to CD Finance Management Co., Ltd. (CFM) for the\nCD Finance Management Expanding Access to Finance for Farmers and Microentrepreneurs\nProject in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC).\n2. The project entails the Asian Development Bank (ADB) providing longer-tenor financing\nto CFM to support the company\u2019s lending operations to farmers and microentrepreneurs in the\nPRC\u2019s rural counties.1 The loan will help expand the availability of microcredit to the underserved,\nincluding women, and support rural economic development.\nII. THE FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARY\nA. Investment Identification and Description\n3. Rural microfinance sector overview. Rapid economic growth in the PRC has lifted more\nthan 800 million people out of extreme poverty since 1980. In 2015, the government set ambitious\ntargets for the eradication of extreme poverty and economic development of all poverty-stricken\ncounties by 2020. The PRC has since made steady progress toward achieving these targets. The\nnumber of people living in extreme poverty, based on the PRC\u2019s national poverty line of CNY2,300\n(2011 constant price) per person per year, gradually declined from 55.8 million in 2015 to 30.5\nmillion in 2017 and to 5.5 million in 2019. The number of poverty-stricken counties declined from\n832 in 2015 to 679 in 2017 and to 52 in 2019. However, the fight against poverty is far from over\nand the impact of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) might reverse some of the gains. Extreme\npoverty remains and income disparity between urban and rural areas persists, with most of the\nlow-income population living in rural areas. The per capita disposable income in 2019 was\nCNY16,021 for rural households, while that for urban households was more than 2.6 times higher.\nWomen account for more than 60% of the rural labor force and perform most of the agricultural\nwork.2 However, they are often marginalized because they have less opportunities for education\nthan men and lack access to skills and information.3\n4. The rural market has large unmet financial needs. As of year-end 2018, 560 million people\nlived in rural areas, including 210 million small farmers.4 The financing gap is estimated to be\nmore than CNY3 trillion.5 Accelerating rural financial innovation to improve access to finance,\nparticularly for women, and bridging the gaps in rural financial services are key to achieving\nsustainable rural development. However, rural financial markets are generally perceived as higher\nrisk than traditional banking markets with higher costs and lower returns. The unavailability of\nacceptable or traditional collateral for borrowing hinders rural households\u2019 access to credit, as\nassets held in rural areas are less valuable and marketable in case of loan defaults. Agricultural\nincome is low and volatile. The general lack of acceptable collateral combined with a low level of\ndisposable income makes providing rural credit services unattractive.\n1  A county is a local administrative division covering the rural areas of a prefecture city. \n2 Permanent Mission of the People\u2019s Republic of China to the UN Office at Geneva and other International \nOrganizations in Switzerland.

In 2005, the People\u2019s Bank of China (PBOC) permitted the establishment of microcredit\ncompanies (MCCs) to promote the development of inclusive finance, but with tight restrictions to \nminimize any negative impacts on financial stability. As of March 2020, the PRC had 7,458 MCCs, \nwith total registered capital of CNY816.98 billion and total outstanding loans of CNY806.3 billion.6 \nHowever, the MCC sector remains fragmented and underdeveloped and few MCCs perform well \nfinancially.  With  an  average  estimated  loan  size  of  CNY400,000\u2013CNY600,000  ($61,444\u2013\n$92,166), most MCCs provide little real microcredit. As PBOC\u2019s 2008 national regulation on MCCs\nhas become outdated, provincial finance management offices issued local policies for MCCs \nregistered in their provinces. MCCs generally have location-based regulatory restrictions and an \nexceedingly  low  cap  on  leverage  ratios,  from  50%  to  400%,  depending  on  the  province. \nCommercial banks are not encouraged or incentivized to lend to MCCs because of the perception \nof the higher risk of sub-borrowers, lending practices, and risk management.7 On 20 August 2020, \nthe Supreme Court released Guidelines on Laws Applicable to Trials of Private Lending Cases, \nwhich cap the legally permissible interest rate for lending by nonregulated financial institutions to \n15.4% (four times the loan prime rate) and could reduce the profitability of the MCC industry if \nstrictly applied.8 \n6. Impact of COVID-19. The pandemic has had significant impacts on the rural economy.\nDuring the peak of the outbreak in the first quarter of 2020, many farmers suffered losses as they\nwere unable to deliver their products to market, while rural microbusiness owners incurred losses\nbecause of the government lockdown and weakened demand. The pandemic has reduced urban\njobs, with migrant workers most severely affected because they typically work in industries such\nas catering, personal services, retail, and light manufacturing. A National Bureau of Statistics\nsurvey in May 2020 showed that about 10% of the 174 million migrant workers as of year-end\n2019 failed to return to work in cities in more developed regions because of the outbreak. The\nMinistry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs estimated that more than 8 million migrant workers had\nstarted working in their home counties by the end of May. ADB must, therefore, continue to\nsupport financial institutions that provide access to critically needed finance to start productive\nrural activities and maintain livelihoods and existing small businesses.\n7. Rationale. ADB\u2019s nonsovereign operations in the PRC\u2019s finance sector have focused on\nunderserved customer segments and regions, primarily through nonbank financial institutions. In\n2016, ADB provided a loan of $50 million to CFM (previously known as CFPA Microfinance\nManagement) to support microfinance in poverty-stricken counties.9 ADB was the company\u2019s first\ninternational lender outside of its shareholders. The long-term ADB loan supported CFM\u2019s rapid\ngrowth and helped the company attract follow-on funding from commercial impact investors. In\n2018, ADB provided $20 million in debt to Microcred Nanchong and Microcred Sichuan to finance\nmicro, small, and medium-sized enterprises in the western region.10 To continue to maintain and\nexpand access to finance in rural regions, CFM, the largest microfinance institution in the PRC,\nwith more than 20 years of operating history and a good track record with ADB, has been identified\nas  a  suitable  candidate.  CFM  operates  exclusively  in  rural  counties,  most  of  which  are\n6  PBOC. 2020. The First Quarter Statistics Report on Microcredit Companies. Beijing.  \n7  Most MCCs are small local moneylenders without proper corporate governance and risk management structures. \n8  Because the guidelines and the method of interest rate calculation are vague about the types of entities they cover, \ntheir impact remains unclear at this stage. \n9  ADB. 2016.

CFM has good \nrisk  management  capacity  and  is  expected to  recover  from  the  impacts  of  the  COVID-19 \npandemic,  which  include  higher  nonperforming  loans.  However,  the  company  will  need  to \ncontinuously source funding from international partners. \nB. Business Overview and Strategy\n8. CFM  was  established  in  2008  as  a  commercially  operated  entity  to  scale  up  the\nmicrofinance activities of the China Foundation for Poverty Alleviation (CFPA) under a joint\nprogram of the World Bank and the Government of the PRC, which had been in operation since\n1996. From 1996 to 2008, the initiative had cumulatively disbursed CNY600 million of microloans\nto 150,000 households. CFM has been growing rapidly since its establishment in 2008, supported\nby several rounds of capital increases, and has transformed from a donor-funded development\nproject to a sustainable commercial institution. CFM expects to operate exclusively in rural\ncounties and continue to serve the financial needs of rural low- and middle-income groups.\n9. CFM is the largest microfinance institution in the PRC with an outstanding microfinance\nloan portfolio of CNY11.25 billion as of June 2020. It currently serves approximately 400,000\nactive borrowers. About 45% of its borrowers are women. CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION\nDELETED.\nC. Ownership, Management, and Governance\n10. Ownership.  CFM\u2019s  ownership  structure  has  changed  since  ADB\u2019s  first  loan.  The\nInternational Finance Corporation (IFC) exited in August after 10 years of supporting CFM\u2019s\ncommercial transformation. As of 31 August 2020, CFM\u2019s largest shareholder was API (Hong\nKong) Investment Limited, with a 34.63% indirect ownership stake, which is 100% owned by AFS\nof Alibaba Group. CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED. ADB conducted integrity due\ndiligence.11 CFM, its shareholders, and board of directors do not appear to constitute a significant\nor potentially significant integrity risk, as no unresolved, unsubstantiated, or adverse media or\nrelevant information is related to them. ADB\u2019s review of CFM does not give ADB cause to believe\nit is being used for money laundering or financing of terrorism. Tax integrity due diligence was not \nrequired. \n11. Management. CFM is led by an experienced management team comprising a president;\na chief financial officer (CFO); a chief operations officer, who is concurrently acting chief risk\nofficer; and a chief technology officer. The president, Dongwen Liu, joined CFPA in 2002 and was\nresponsible for the non-governmental organization\u2019s microfinance projects since 2005 before\nbecoming the general manager of CFM when it was established. The CFO, Zhen Li, joined \nCFPA\u2019s microfinance department as financial controller in 2008, and later became CFM\u2019s CFO. \nZ.Li is a certified public accountant and previously worked at Tianhua Zhongxing Accounting Firm\nas audit manager, China Merchant Bank, and China Construction Bank as finance manager. The\nchief operations officer, who concurrently serves as the chief risk officer, Dianzuo Chen, joined\nCFM  in  2015.  Before  joining  CFM,  D.

He joined Alibaba \nGroup in 2011 and has served as vice president of AFS since 2014, where he is responsible for \nstrategic investment and finance. The board has three committees: audit and risk, nomination and \nremuneration, and strategy. The audit and risk committee is responsible for assessing the key \nrisks faced by the company; evaluating the internal control and risk management system; making \nrecommendations to the board on risk management, accounting policy, and internal audit; \nproviding risk warnings to senior management; and ensuring the timely correction of any issues \nand problems identified from internal audit. The nomination and remuneration committee is \nresponsible for setting and implementing the guiding principles of the company\u2019s salary and stock \ndistribution  policy;  and  approving  the  compensation  package,  employment  contracts,  and \nseparation agreements of all members of the senior management team.

Implementation Arrangements \n \n14.  Use of proceeds. CFM will use the proceeds of the ADB loan to finance microloans of up \nto CNY200,000 to farmers and microentrepreneurs. At least 60% of the ADB-financed loans will \nbe disbursed to women sub-borrowers.12 \n \n15.  Legal documentation. The loan to CFM will be governed by a facility agreement, which \nwill be based on ADB\u2019s customary terms and conditions for a loan of this nature and amount. \n \n16.  Reporting arrangements. ADB will monitor the project over its life. CFM will provide ADB \nwith financial and other reports at predetermined regular intervals and as requested, including \n(i) semiannual  unaudited  financial  statements,  (ii)  annual  audited  financial  statements, \n(iii) semiannual compliance certificates for financial covenants, (iv) annual reports on the sub-loan \nportfolio, and (v) annual reports on the selected development indicators and the safeguard and \nsocial dimension policy agreed by ADB and the borrower. \n \n17.  Evaluation. ADB will prepare monitoring reports regularly and at least annually. The first \nreport will be submitted no later than 12 months after the first disbursement. \n \nC.

ADB\u2019s loan facility has a longer tenor than the company\u2019s \nmicrofinance products and, as a result, the ADB loans can be rolled over several times, thereby \nmaximizing development impact in rural areas, which greatly need access to finance. \n \n19.  Support gender mainstreaming. The project has a gender-specific microloan target of \n60% for women, expected to directly benefit 30,100 women borrowers. A gender action plan has \nbeen prepared to support the effective gender mainstreaming classification of the project. Gender \nmeasures will increase CFM\u2019s focus on bringing financing and other services to women and \nproviding them with nonfinancial training and financial education. \n \nD.  CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \nIV.  DEVELOPMENT IMPACT AND STRATEGIC ALIGNMENT \n \nA.  Development Impacts, Outcome, and Outputs \n \n20.  Impacts. The project is aligned with the government\u2019s strategy of developing rural finance \nsystem to support rural revitalization and supporting reemployment of migrant workers affected \nby the COVID-19 pandemic in home regions by developing rural industries.13 The COVID-19 \npandemic has impacted rural economies through supply disruption, demand shock, and reduced \nurban jobs for migrant workers. Micro credit will help farmers and former migrant workers start \nand maintain agriculture and other business activities in the rural areas, thus mitigating the \npandemic\u2019s impacts. \n \n21.  Outcome. The project will have the following outcome: uptake of inclusive financial \nservices by farmers and microentrepreneurs improved, particularly among women borrowers. \nADB\u2019s long-term funding will enable CFM to scale up its business despite the increased risk posed \nby the pandemic and provide urgently needed funding to underserved customers, thereby helping \nreduce poverty and income inequality. \n \n22.  Outputs. The outputs will be (i) CFM\u2019s microfinance lending to rural households and male \nand female microentrepreneurs expanded; and (ii) CFM\u2019s ability to render services to women \nclients enhanced through increased participation of women farmers and microentrepreneurs and \nCFM staff members in financial education, nonfinancial training, and dedicated outreach activities. \n \nB.  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n \n23.  Consistency with ADB strategy and country strategy. The project supports three \nStrategy 2030 operational priorities: (i) tackling remaining poverty and reducing inequalities, \n(ii) accelerating progress in gender equality, and (iii) promoting rural development and food \nsecurity.14 The project is consistent with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, 2016\u20132020 for the \nPRC,15 and ADB\u2019s country operations business plan, 2019\u20132021 for the PRC, which prioritize \npromoting inclusive economic growth, reducing poverty and inequality, developing small and \n \n13 Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China. 2020.

POLICY COMPLIANCE \n \nA.  Safeguards and Social Dimensions \n \n25.  Category FI (treated as C). In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement \n(2009), ADB categorizes the investment as FI (treated as C) for impacts on the environment, \ninvoluntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples.23 \n \n26.  Environmental  and  social  safeguards.  The  loan  will  fund  CFM\u2019s  microfinance \noperations with loans averaging CNY27,080. Most sub-loans will be provided to rural households \nfor agribusiness (e.g., livestock, fish, and crop farming); and microenterprises related to trade, \nhandicraft making, and services.24 The sub-loans under the ADB loan are expected to have \nminimal environmental, climate change and social impacts. The sub-borrowers\u2019 activities are not \nforeseen to entail land acquisition, physical or economic displacements, or impact on indigenous \npeoples\u2019 communities. CFM will apply the Prohibited Investment Activities List and screening and \ncategorization definition of ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) and comply with relevant \nnational laws, standards, and regulations. The project will exclude all sub-loans that exceed \nCNY200,000 and/or those with potential impacts and risks that may be classified as category A \nor B for environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples. CFM will comply with \nnational labor laws and internationally recognized core labor standards in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nSocial Protection Strategy. CFM will step up environmental and social performance monitoring \nand reporting to ensure that ineligible sub-borrowers are excluded from ADB financing and that \nrobust information on the portfolio\u2019s environmental and social performance is provided to ADB. \n \n27.
