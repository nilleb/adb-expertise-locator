Complementary  program  and  project  components  will \ncollectively  address  key  priorities  related  to  equitable  access,  quality  and  relevance,  and \nsubsector  management  in  the  SES.  The  program  will  principally  be  national  in  scope,  with \naccess-related project investments targeted to selected disadvantaged and underserved areas.3  \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROGRAM \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\n3. \nThe Government of the Lao PDR ascribes a high priority to education as a prerequisite \nfor  sustained  economic  growth  and  poverty  reduction. 4  Government  and  international \ndevelopment  partner  (IDP)  efforts  have  focused  on  the  primary  level  (grades  1\u20135),  and \nsignificant progress has been made. Gains have also been made in the SES, with the transition \nto a 7-year system marking a key milestone.5 At the same time, key gaps in access, quality and \nrelevance, and subsector management undermine the contributions made by the SES and the \nentire  education  system  to  modernization,  equity  and  inclusive  growth,  poverty  reduction,  and \nbroader socioeconomic development in the Lao PDR. \n \n4. \nAccess.  As  primary  education  has  expanded,  the  SES  has  become  a  key  bottleneck. \nFrom  SY2006/07  to  SY2009/10,  the  lower  secondary  education  (LSE)  gross  enrolment  ratio \n(GER) rose from 53.3% to 60.2%, with the upper secondary education (USE) GER stagnant at \n34.0%.6 Aggregate  figures  conceal  large  socioeconomic  and  geographic  gaps.7 Particularly  in \npoor,  rural,  and  largely  ethnic  group  areas,  enrolment  rates  decline  steadily  and  gender  gaps \nwiden  at  higher  grades.  Expanding  access  requires  policies  and  investments  to  address  an \narray of demand-side issues (e.g., financial and opportunity costs, language and other cultural \nfactors, and disabilities) and supply-side factors (e.g., weak school network coverage of remote \nareas, and inadequate financial and human resources), as well as quality issues. \n \n5. \nQuality.  Low  SES  enrolment  and  high rates  of  repetition  and  especially  dropout  partly \nreflect quality gaps.8 Particularly for LSE, rapid rises in the number of primary school graduates \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The SES comprises lower and upper secondary education. \n3  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided project preparatory technical assistance. ADB. 2010. Concept Paper \n\nfor Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic: Basic Education Sector Development Program II. Manila. \n\n4  Government strategies, indicators, and analysis of progress and challenges in the education sector are detailed in \n\nSector Assessment: Education (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n5  Completed during school years (SY) 2009/10 and SY2010/11,  the extension of lower secondary education (LSE) \nby  the  Ministry  of  Education  (MOE)  from  3  years  to  4  years  and  the  subsequent  addition  of  upper  secondary \neducation (USE) grade 12 aligns the Lao PDR's system of primary education (5 years), LSE (4 years), and USE (3 \nyears) with the international standard of 12 years of primary and secondary schooling. \n\n6  The GER fell slightly in SY2009/10, despite a large rise in total enrolment, due to the extension of LSE to 4 years. \n7  For example, in SY2009/10, GERs in LSE were 44.4% for girls and 56.1% for boys in the poorest districts.  \n8  The national LSE dropout rate was 13% in SY2009/10 and is much higher in many poor and ethnic areas. In seven \n\nof the poorest provinces only 11%\u201325% of children are expected to reach and complete grade 11. \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nthe  Asian  Development  Bank \n\nand limited resourcing have strained capacities to provide access to good quality education. As \npart of comprehensive SES reforms, the Ministry of Education (MOE) has developed new LSE \nand  USE  curricula  and  new  LSE  textbooks  and  teacher  guides,  and  commenced  the  cohort-\nbased  phase-in  of  the  new  SES  curriculum  in  SY2010/11.  Follow-on  policy  and  investment \nsupport  will  be  critical  for  these  reforms  to  become  fully  operational  and  to  realize  gains  from \n(and  meet  challenges  linked  to)  the  addition  of  a  fourth  year  of  LSE  in  SY2009/10,  and  the \npotential  of  new  SES  curricula  to  better  feed  in  to  subsequent  learning  and  employment. \nPriorities include bolstering (i) systems and institutions providing pre- and in-service training and \nsupport  to  SES  teachers;9 (ii)  mechanisms  for  teacher  deployment  to  poor,  rural,  and  largely \nethnic  group  areas  (particularly  in  subjects  such  as  science  and  math);  and  (iii)  investment  in \nfacilities and teaching and learning materials (including textbooks and laboratory facilities). \n \nSubsector management.  Interlinked with access and quality issues, gaps  in subsector \n6. \nmanagement undermine learning outcomes and the internal and external efficiency of the SES. \nLow investment poses an overarching issue for the education sector, and the SES is particularly \nunderresourced,  with \nIDP  providing \ncomprehensive support.10 Financing gaps compound other urgent SES management challenges: \n(i) institutional capacity, including the need for further rationalization alongside decentralization; \n(ii)  human  resources  and technical  and  managerial  capacities;  (iii)  planning  and  budgeting,  as \nwell as management information systems; (iv) assessment of teachers and of student learning \noutcomes, and broader quality control; and (v) enhanced mobilization of private sector actors. \n \n7. \nSector  development  program  approach.  The  Lao  PDR\u2019s  Education  Sector \nDevelopment  Framework  (ESDF)  provides  (i)  a  plan  with  which  to  operationalize  the  National \nEducation System Reform Strategy 2006\u20132015, and (ii) a unified framework for government and \nIDP  efforts.  Dialogue  toward  ADB\u2019s  next  country  partnership  strategy  for  the  Lao  PDR  has \nidentified education as a core sector, and the government has called on ADB to maintain its role \nas the lead IDP supporting the SES. The program will build on, consolidate, and advance key \nSES  reforms  catalyzed  with  support  under  the  ongoing  Basic  Education  Sector  Development \nProgram  (BESDP),  which  demonstrated  the  efficacy  of  the  sector  development  program \nmodality.11 In particular, the program will seamlessly dovetail with BESDP support for curriculum \nreform,  assisting  the  MOE  to  complete  the  introduction  of  the  new  4-year  LSE  curriculum  by \nSY2013/14  and  in  all  three  USE  grades  by  SY2016/17.  Comprehensive  program  and  project \nsupport  will  also  build  on  lessons,  models,  and  capacities  built  under  the  BESDP  to  advance \nprogress  in  the  SES  under  all  three  ESDF  pillars:  (i)  assuring  equitable  access,  (ii)  improving \nquality and relevance, and (iii) strengthening sector governance and performance management. \n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nthe  only \n\n(ADB) \n\n8. \nThe impact of the program will be improved educational attainment in the Lao PDR. The \noutcome  will  be  enhanced  equity,  quality,  and  efficiency  of  secondary  education  in  the  Lao \nPDR.12 While the program and project components will principally be national in scope, project \ninvestments to expand access will be targeted to 30 selected districts (para. 19).  \n                                                \n9  This includes lack of a clear policy on information and communication technology (ICT) for education, in particular \nfor equity-enhancing and sustainable investments in low-cost ICT to improve teaching and pedagogical support. \n10 Rising  national investment  in recent  years  has  been  partly offset  by  declining  IDP  investment for  education.  The \nshare of the national budget allocated to education increased from a trough of below 12.0% in FY2005 to 15.5% in \nFY2010 but remains below the 18.0% level stated in the Education Law (revised in 2007). \n\n11 ADB. 2006. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Loan and Grant  to \nthe Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic for the Basic Education Sector Development Program. Manila. The program \nwill also link to proposed technical assistance to support education reforms, included in ADB\u2019s 2012 pipeline. \n\n12 Key targets include raising the share of female primary school graduates entering LSE (Appendix 1). \n\n\f \n\nC. \n\nOutputs \n\n9. \nDirectly aligned with the Lao PDR\u2019s ongoing SES reform agenda and the ESDF\u2019s three \npillars, the program\u2019s outputs will be (i) expanded access to secondary education, (ii) improved \ndelivery of new SES curricula, and (iii) strengthened SES management. \n \n\n1. \n\nProgram Outputs \n\nKey  policy  actions  supported  under  the  program  are  outlined  in  paras.  11\u201317,  with \n\n \n10. \ndetails provided in the development policy letter (Appendix 3) and policy matrix (Appendix 4). \n \n\na. \n\nExpanded Access to Secondary Education \n\n \n11. \nStipends  for  disadvantaged  students. The MOE has put a high priority on launching \nand  expanding  needs-based  LSE  and  USE  stipends.13 The  program  and  project  will  support \ndevelopment and demonstration of modalities to ensure efficacy and targeting to disadvantaged \nstudents. The policy matrix includes sequenced policy actions for development and approval of \nbeneficiary  selection  criteria  and  interim  implementation  guidelines  (including  targets  for  girls \nand  ethnic  students)  for  MOE-administered  stipends  at  all  post-primary  levels,  followed  by \nresourcing and launch of an expanded SES stipend program for disadvantaged students. \n \n12. \nDormitories to enhance equitable access. The MOE recognizes dormitories as a key \ninstrument for addressing constraints on access, particularly for girls and ethnic group children \nin  remote  villages  located  far  from  secondary  schools.  At  the  same  time,  despite  increasing \ninvestments,  there  is  no  concrete  policy  for  dormitories  in  the  SES.  Complemented  by \ninterventions under the project component, the program will support the MOE\u2019s completion of a \nreview  of  existing  dormitories  and  their  impact  on  equitable  access  in  the  SES,  followed  by \nadoption of a related policy on, and guidelines for, dormitories in the subsector. \n \n\nb. \n\nImproved Delivery of New Secondary Education Subsector Curricula \n\n \n13. \nPreservice teacher training, recruitment, deployment, and utilization planning. The \nprogram (and complementary project support) will help further operationalize existing policies14 \nvia  a  series  of  policy  actions  aimed  at  (i)  MOE  approval  of  revised  national  curricula  for \npreservice teacher training for LSE and then USE, along with minimum quality standards for all \n13  teacher  training  institutions (TTIs);15 (ii)  conduct  and  evaluation  by  MOE  of  a  pilot  test  of  a \nteacher placement scheme to attract TTI graduates to teach in remote areas; and (iii) approval \nby  MOE of guidelines for use by provincial education services, district education bureaus, and \ninstitutions concerned with developing annual teacher recruitment and utilization plans. \n \nImproving  in-service  teacher  performance.  Given  the  importance  of  monitoring  and \n14. \nimproving  teacher  performance  to  improving  quality  and  advancing  pupil-centered  active \nlearning,  the  program  will  support  the  MOE\u2019s  development  and  approval  of  guidelines  and \nadoption of an operational manual for teacher performance monitoring and evaluation (M&E). \n \n15. \nSecondary  education  subsector  curriculum  reform.  As noted in paras. 5 and 7, the \nintroduction of an improved curriculum and related materials for the 7-year SES is a core thrust \n\n                                                \n13 The ESDF sets a target of extending stipends to eventually cover 20% of all LSE and USE students. \n14 These include the Teacher Education Strategy and Action Plan, and the  Teacher Development and Management \n\nPolicy Framework and Action Plan developed with BESDP support and approved in 2011. \n\n15 The TTIs consist of 10 teacher education institutes and 3 faculties of education. \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\nof  national  education  reforms,  as  reflected  in the  ESDF.  Building  directly  on  reforms  launched \nunder the BESDP and directly supported by the program\u2019s project component, the program will \nsupport the completion by the MOE of the cohort-based introduction of the new LSE curriculum, \nincluding  nationwide  textbook  and  teacher  guide  distribution  and  related  teacher  training  for \nfourth year LSE in SY2013/14, followed by approval of new textbooks for all USE grades.16 \n  \n\nc. \n\nStrengthened Secondary Education Subsector Management \n\n \nEnhanced  resourcing  and  planning  for  education.  The  Lao  PDR  Education  Law, \n16. \nESDF,  and  other  policy  documents  commit  to  increased  education  sector  investment.  The \nESDF targets increased and better-managed nonsalary recurrent costs and the introduction of \nblock grants as key thrusts. The program will directly support these thrusts, as well as measures \nsuch  as  school  network  mapping,  which  will  be  essential  to  ensure  that  investments  in  new \nschool construction align with the need to efficiently and equitably expand access. Supported by \nproject interventions, a series of policy actions aim at achieving (i) the 18% share of education \nin the total budget required by the Education Law; (ii) an increased share of nonsalary recurrent \nexpenditures  within  the  MOE\u2019s  total  budget;  (iii)  development  and  approval  of  a  policy  for \nintroducing block grants to cover recurrent costs at all levels within the MOE system, supported \nby  a  block  grant  management  manual,  and  subsequent  allocation  and  release  of  block  grants \nfor LSE schools in all 30 districts classified as poorest and educationally disadvantaged (para. \n19);  and  (iv)  MOE  completion  of  nationwide  SES  school  network  mapping  and  issuance  of  a \ndecree on its use to guide planning for future capital investment. \n \n17. \ninformation  and  communication \ntechnology  strategy.  A final set of  policy actions will promote broader education reforms and \nsector  performance  (particularly  in  the  SES):  (i)  approval  and  launch  of  a  communication \nstrategy  within  the  MOE  system  and  outwards  to  communities  and  other  stakeholders;  (ii) \napproval  of  a  revised  decree  on  private  education;17 and  (iii)  approval  of  policy  and  a  detailed \nstrategy for appropriate information and communication technology (ICT) to support grades 1\u2013\n12 education which are clearly dictated by education aims, equity, and sustainability. \n \n\nImproved  stakeholder  mobilization  and \n\n2. \n\nProject Outputs \n\nThe  project  grant  supports \n\n \n18. \nthat  closely  align  with  and  support \nimplementation of the policy program. It directly supports attainment of national targets for  the \nSES:  outputs  2  and  3  (paras.  22\u201330)  are  nationwide  in  scope,  while  output  1  interventions \nstrategically focus on 30 target districts (para. 19) for maximum impact on access.18  \n \n\ninterventions \n\na. \n\nExpanded Access to Secondary Education \n\n \nClassroom provision to expand physical access.19 The output will provide a series of \n19. \nmeasures  to  expand  equitable  access  in  30  targeted  districts  that  are  classified  by  the \ngovernment as both \u201cpoorest\u201d and \u201ceducationally disadvantaged\u201d; these lie in 15 mostly poorer \nprovinces,  and  are  clustered  along  the  Lao  PDR\u2019s  borders.  To  address  physical  access,  the \n                                                \n16 All textbooks and teacher guides developed will be sensitive to gender, ethnicity, and disability. \n17 This builds on BESDP support to  the MOE to develop the Strategy for Promoting Private Education (approved in \n\n2011), which includes private schools as well as private (including nonprofit) actors\u2019 support to public schools. \n\n18 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2) provides more detailed \n\ndescriptions of project interventions. \n\n19 The project will provide one classroom per grade, one multi-use room (e.g., for science teaching and library use), \none teacher room, electricity, potable water supply, and sex-segregated sanitation facilities. USE classroom blocks \nwill indicatively also include one dedicated science laboratory. All designs will ensure access by disabled children. \n\n\fprogram will (i) construct one new LSE school in underserved areas within each of the 30 target \ndistricts, (ii) build one USE classroom block20 at each of 15 existing school sites, and (iii) provide \nfurniture packages (plus teaching and learning materials under output 2). \n  \nDirect  support  for  disadvantaged  students.  The  output  will  support  (i)  a  baseline \n20. \nstudy  to  identify  candidates  for  LSE  and  USE  stipend  support  (starting  in  SY2012/13  and \nSY2013/14) from among eligible poor children expected to graduate in grades 5 and 9 the prior \nyear;  (ii)  provision  of  4-year  stipends  for  roughly  1,740  poor  LSE  entrants;  and  (iii)  3-year \nstipends  for  roughly  1,200  poor  USE  entrants.  Detailed  guidelines  (to  be  agreed  before  fund \nrelease) will ensure at least 50% of recipients are girls and 80% are ethnic group students.21 \n \n21. \nSchool-level  support  to  enhance  equitable  access.  Complementing stipend support \nin  these  30  new  and  30  existing  LSE  schools,  the  output  will  support  (i)  construction  and \ncommunity  management  of  low-cost  dormitories,  including  sex-segregated  sleeping  facilities \nand  sanitation  facilities,  and  mechanisms  for  adult  supervision;  (ii)  remedial  support  targeting \nboarders  in  particular;22 and  (iii)  school  access  grants,  to  be  provided  in  four  annual  cycles \nbased  on  proposals  from  (and  administered  by)  pupil\u2013parent  associations  (PPAs).23 Parallel \ninterventions will support expanded USE access at the 15 schools receiving USE stipends. \n \n\nb. \n\nImproved Delivery of New Secondary Education Subsector Curricula \n\n \n22. \nPreservice  training  and  placement  of  new  secondary  education  subsector \nteachers.  To strengthen training and deployment of new SES teachers nationwide, the output \nwill  (i)  assist  the  MOE  to  develop  preservice  teacher  training  curricula  (aligned  with  new  SES \ncurricula) for use by all TTIs, and to introduce a TTI quality assurance system; (ii) bolstering TTI \ncapacities and instructional resources; (iii) pilot testing in five districts a new placement scheme \nto attract new science teachers to LSE schools in poor and remote areas;24 and (iv) developing \nprocedures, manuals, and M&E tools for teacher recruitment and utilization planning. \n \n23. \nIn-service teacher training and support. To prepare in-service teachers to deliver the \nnew SES curriculum, the output will support (i) annual nationwide teacher training during 2012\u2013\n2016 to support completion of the rollout of new LSE and then USE curricula;25 (ii) expansion of \nthe  MOE\u2019s  capacity  to  develop  ICT-based  materials  (e.g.,  TV,  radio,  and  DVD),  particularly \nthose  to  support  teachers  and  teacher  training;  (iii)  capacity  development  for  secondary \npedagogical  advisors  nationwide  via  inclusion  in  training-of-trainers  for  the  in-service  training, \nand  annual  experience-sharing  meetings;  (iv)  pilot  testing  a  new  initiative  to  equip  secondary \npedagogical advisors in five districts with laptop computers and ICT materials, along with other \nsupport, to strengthen the advisors\u2019 role in providing in-school support for SES teachers; and (v) \nprovision of grants to allow 30 LSE science teachers to upgrade to bachelor degree level.26 \n                                                \n20 USE  classroom  blocks  will  be  provided later  in  the  project, often  to  extend  an LSE school  to  cover  USE grades. \n\nSites in the noted 15 provinces will be selected after the school network mapping under output 3. \n\n21 Output  3  will  support  LSE  and  USE  stipend  programs  by  mobilizing  pupil\u2013parent  associations  (PPAs)  and \n\nsupporting M&E, including rigorous impact evaluation, to feed into policy dialogue on stipends. \n\n22 Priority will be given to boarding students (especially girls), many of whom will be ethnic students from more remote \n\nvillages, who are likely to have weaker foundations from primary school. \n\n23 PPA proposals for access grants will be based on local needs. Detailed guidelines (to be agreed upon before fund \nrelease) will specify eligible uses, including expansion of low-cost dormitories and/or remedial support, as well as \nsmall income-generating activities (e.g., school gardens) with a demonstrated link to increased access and equity.  \n24 This will include cash transfers to support placement and retention of 25 mostly female and ethnic TTI graduates in \ntheir first 2 years of teaching. M&E will assess options for sustainability and scaling up, and inform refinements. \n25 Virtually all SES teachers nationwide are expected to receive 5 days of face-to-face training at least once by project \nend (SES teachers typically teach multiple grades). Training will also include content on in-school peer training. \n26 Prioritizing female and ethnic group teachers, grants will support all costs of summer training over a 3-year period, \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\nNew  curriculum  materials  (textbooks  and  teacher  guides).

In  terms  of  fiscal  burden,  the \nincremental costs (investment and recurrent) associated with the project have a peak value of \n2.6% of the total education budget midproject and fall below 0.5% post-project, which is deemed \nmodest and sustainable. Moreover, costs may be largely offset by sizeable efficiency gains due \nto increased completion of LSE and USE (dropout currently constitutes major wastage of state \n\n                                                \n35 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n36 Economic Analysis and Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n37 ADB.  2010.

The  MOE  has  extensive  experience  with  ADB \nprojects, and project management will benefit from the continuity of roles by the Department of \nSecondary  Education, the  project  management  unit,  and  other  units  under the  BESDP.  ADB\u2019s \nAnticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was  explained  to  and  discussed  with  the \ngovernment  and the  MOE. The specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary  measures  are \ndescribed in the project administration manual.38 \n\n \nPoverty and Social \n\nC. \n\nPoverty.  Pro-poor  thrusts  are  mainstreamed  within  all  three  outputs  under  both  the \n37. \nprogram and project. Supporting pro-poor policy thrusts under the program, project investments \ndirectly  or  indirectly  address  constraints  facing  the  poor  and  other  disadvantaged  groups, \nincluding  (i)  addressing  direct  and  opportunity  costs  of  education  by  providing  needs-targeted \nstipends  and  school  access  grants  in  the  30  highly  disadvantaged  districts;  (ii)  enhancing \ncurricular  relevance;  (iii)  increasing  the  supply  of  qualified  teachers  in  poor  rural  areas;  (iv) \npromoting  participation  by  all  students  via  training  on  student-centered  learning  and  (in  target \nschools)  remedial  support  for  disadvantaged  children  (e.g.,  poor  children  from  non-Lao-\nspeaking families); (v) providing textbooks and library materials; and (vi) expanding LSE school \nnetworks to unserved areas in 30 districts, and providing LSE and USE dormitories, particularly \nfor girls and other poor ethnic group students from remote villages.39 \n \nGender.  The  program  also  tackles  gender  issues  under  all  three  outputs.  To  address \n38. \naccess constraints that often disproportionately affect girls, the gender action plan ensures that \n(i)  new  LSE  schools  are  located  in areas with low  female enrolment;  (ii) civil  works  at  all  LSE \nand  USE  sites  include  sex-segregated  toilets;  and  (iii)  poor  girls  receive  50%  of  dormitory \nspaces,  stipends,  and  remedial  learning  opportunities. Quality-related  actions  include ensuring \ngender  sensitivity  in  new  curriculum  materials  (and  via  teacher  training),  and  that  females \nreceive  50%  of  places  in  (i)  all  preservice  and  in-service  teacher  training  for  LSE  and  USE \nteachers, (ii) the pilot teacher placement scheme, and (iii) teacher qualification upgrade grants. \nOutput  3  will  (i)  prioritize  female  representation  in  all  management  training  programs  and \nsupport  strategies;  (ii)  conduct  advocacy  campaigns  on  the  benefits  of  girls\u2019  schooling  and \npromote  their  education  in  science;  and  (iii)  provide  recognition  awards  for  districts  with  good \nequity-enhancement practices and increased access for girls, especially ethnic girls. \n\n \nSafeguards \n\nD. \n\n39. \nIn accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the program is classified \ncategory C for involuntary resettlement and environment, having no significant adverse impacts. \nIt  is  classified category  B for  indigenous  peoples  (termed \u201cethnic groups\u201d  in  the  Lao  PDR).  All \nthree program outputs emphasize access, quality, and SES management in poor, remote, and \n\n                                                \n38 Project  Administration  Manual  (accessible  from  the  list  of  linked  documents  in  Appendix  2),  with  findings  from  a \n\nprocurement capacity assessment reflected in Appendix 18 to the project administration manual. \n\n39 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy, Gender Action Plan, and Indigenous Peoples Plan (Ethnic Group \n\nPlan) (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\fethnic  group  areas.40 Key  features  of  the  ethnic  group  plan  include  ensuring  that  (i)  ethnic \ngroups receive (a) 80% of dormitory spaces, stipends, and remedial learning opportunities, (b) \n80% of places for a pilot teacher placement scheme and for teacher qualification upgrade grants, \nand  (c)  preferential  access  to  in-service  training  (including  as  trainers);  (ii)  all  textbooks  and \nother materials developed under the project are ethnicity-sensitive; and (iii) institutional analysis, \nschool network mapping, M&E, and other analysis include ethnic group issues and criteria. \n\n \nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\nE. \n\n40. \nPotential risks include a faltering MOE commitment to sector strategies and targets, and \nlost momentum on budgetary increases. These will be mitigated by the program\u2019s reinforcement \nof the government\u2019s  existing  reform  agenda,  ESDF,  and Education  Law,  including through  the \ntwo-tranche program loan. Operational-side risks (e.g., related to financial management) will be \nminimized  through  continuity  in  project  management  structures  with  the  BESDP,  development \nof  clear  guidelines  for  key  interventions,  and  consultant  support.  Major  risks  and  mitigating \nmeasures are described in detail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.41 \n \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n\n41. \nThe  government  and  MOE  have  assured  ADB  that  implementation  of  the  sector \ndevelopment  program  shall  conform  to  all  applicable  ADB  policies  including  those  concerning \nanticorruption  measures,  safeguards,  gender,  procurement,  consulting  services,  and \ndisbursement  as  described  in  detail  in  the  project  administration  manual  and  loan  and  grant \ndocuments.
