Bhd.  (EMSB)  to  finance  its  acquisition  of  a \nportfolio of nonperforming mortgage loans (Portfolio) from HSBC Bank Malaysia Berhad (HSBC \nor the Seller), in the amount of up to $10 million (the Project). \n \n\nII. \n\nBACKGROUND AND RATIONALE \n\nA. \n\nOverview of the Asian Nonperforming Loans Market \n\n2. \nActivity  in  Asia\u2019s  nonperforming  loans  (NPLs)  market  has  gradually  picked  up  since \nAsia\u2019s  economic  crisis  crippled  its  financial  sector  in  the  late  1990s.  The  Asian  region's \ngovernments and banks have succeeded in removing more than $1 trillion of NPLs from bank \nbalance  sheets.  That  has  been  accomplished  through  various  resolution  measures  including \nloan  collection,  restructuring,  and  reclassification;  sale  of  NPLs  to  international  investors; \npermanent  write-offs;  good  bank/bad  bank  disposition  strategies;  and  use  of  local  asset \nmanagement companies. While Asia\u2019s banks have approximately $746 billion remaining on their \nbalance  sheets,  the  region  has  made  significant  progress  in  financial  system  reform  and  NPL \ndisposition.  Financial  system  reform  is  advancing  to  prevent  recurring  NPL  problems,  and \nregulators  have  been  pushing  banks  to  develop  new  plans,  processes,  and  systems  to \nimplement internal rating-based models.  \n \n3. \nHowever,  while  banks  in  the  region  are  advancing  measures  to  prevent  new  flows  of \nNPLs, the existing NPL stock still needs attention.  A vibrant secondary NPL market is needed, \nas well as viable and market- tested resolution strategies, so that existing NPLs can be resolved.  \nIn  the  case  of  new  NPLs,  banks  and  other  market  participants  would  also  benefit  from  a  fully \nfunctioning NPL market.  In addition, in the growing Asian economies, bank management\u2019s full \nattention  on  best  practice  in  lending  and  its  continuous  improvement  are  needed.    NPLs \n(including existing NPL stock) would detract from this crucial exercise. Appendixes 1 and 2 give \na detailed discussion of the benefits of NPL resolution and financial and corporate restructuring.  \n \nB. \n\nNonperforming Loans in Malaysia \n\n1. \n\nThe Danaharta Experience \n\nIn 1998, Danaharta was established by the Malaysian Government as the national asset \n4. \nmanagement  corporation  (AMC)  to  avert  a  collapse  of  the  banking  system  due  to  the  Asian \nfinancial  crisis.    Its  purpose  was  to  remove  the  NPL  distraction  from  financial  institutions  by \nbuying and rehabilitating NPLs while extracting maximum recovery value from them.  \n \n5. \nDanaharta  completed  its  NPL  acquisitions  in  2000,  and  between  then  and  2005, \nrecovery  action  on  most  of  the  loans  took  place.  By  30  September  2005,  the  final  tally  of \nDanaharta\u2019s  NPL  portfolio  amounted  to  RM47.68  billion,  of  which  RM19.71  million  constituted \nacquired  NPLs 1  and  RM27.97  million,  managed  NPLs. 2  In  total,  there  were  2,902  accounts \nbelonging to 2,563 borrowers (some borrowers had more than one loan account). The RM19.71 \nbillion  of  acquired  NPLs  were  acquired  at  a  purchase  price  of  RM8.94  billion,  implying  an \naverage discount rate of 54.6%.  \n                                                 \n1   Acquired NPLs are those paid for in cash and through the issuance of Danaharta\u2019s zero-coupon bonds. \n2   Managed NPLs cost Danaharta nothing to \u201cacquire\u201d, since Danaharta merely managed these loans on behalf of the \n\nGovernment and Bank Negara Malaysia (Central Bank). \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\n \n6. \nGross  NPL  levels  in  the  banking  system  in  Malaysia  have  been  falling  post-Danaharta \ncarve-outs,  from  a  high  of  RM61.9  billion  ($16.3  billion) 3   in  2001  to  RM45.2  billion  ($11.9 \nbillion)4 as of end-2005. Malaysia\u2019s net NPL ratio as of end-2005 stood at 6.0%, well below the \n13.6% recorded in 1998 at the height of the Asian financial crisis.  As of 31 January 2007, net \nNPLs  stood  at  RM26.6  billion,  or  4.6%  of  total  net  loans.  However,  there  is  room  for \nimprovement,  especially  with  the  emphasis  on  risk  management  in  relation  to  Basel  II  capital \nadequacy standards, targeted for compliance in 2008. \n \n\n2. \n\nRecent Developments \n\n7. \nIn  December  2005,  Bank  Negara  Malaysia  (BNM)  issued  \u201cGuidelines  for  the  Sale  of \nNPLs  by  Banking  Institutions\u201d  (the  BNM  Guidelines  for  NPLs),  to  allow  Malaysian  banks  to \ndispose  of  NPLs  of  up  to  RM46  billion  to  other  banks  or  domestic  and  foreign  investors  via \nspecial-purpose vehicles (SPVs). The guidelines were issued just as Danaharta was closing its \ndoors after 7.5 years of operation.5  The guidelines do not provide any other form of incentives, \nwhich  are  common  in  many  countries  embarking  on  NPL  sales,  i.e.,  tax  exemption  for  stamp \nduty and other transaction costs. Appendix 3 presents the salient points of the guidelines. \n \n8. \nSince then, the country has witnessed only one major NPL transaction. In January 2007, \nMalayan Banking Berhad (Maybank), Malaysia\u2019s largest bank, announced the sale of a portfolio \nof corporate NPLs consisting of almost 100 borrowers with a face value of RM2.2 billion ($612 \nmillion)  to  Standard  Chartered  Bank  and  Standard  Bank  of  South  Africa  Group  for  a  total \nconsideration of RM424.8 billion ($123.30 million). The sale was completed in June 2007.   This \nwas the first time a Malaysian bank undertook such a sale by competitive open bidding.  When \nthe  transaction  was  announced,  it  was  widely  felt  that  activity  levels  in  the  NPL  market  would \npick up substantially with other Malaysian banks joining in the foray, with a portfolio sale having \nbeen completed, and that major disposals would follow closely. However, no other transactions \nhave followed as yet.  \n \n\n3. \n\nOpportunities \n\nMalaysia enjoys a number of advantages for NPL investment. The legal system is seen \n9. \nas both developed and robust compared with that in other NPL markets in Asia, and the political \nclimate has proven to be historically stable. The real estate sector has also shown considerable \ngrowth in recent years across most sectors. Add to that the greater number of recovery options \nfor  holders  of  debt  (receivership  being  one),  and  the  perception  that  the  risk  profile  of  the \nMalaysian market appears lower than that of many of its Asian neighbors. \n \n10. \nRegulatory  actions  are seen  as  a  prime  catalyst  to  force  a  significant  proportion  of  the \nexisting NPL stock off the balance sheets of the Malaysian banks. Since 2 years ago, BNM had \nimposed  tightened  loan  provisioning  guidelines  for  NPLs  aged  more  than  5  years.  This  has \nprovided  incentives  to  banks  to  either  resolve  or  dispose  of  these  loans  to  avoid  having  to \ncreate  additional  provisions,  or  clean  up  their  books.  This  fits  well  with  the  impending \ncompliance with Basel II in 2008 and the ongoing liberalization of Malaysia\u2019s financial sector. \n \n\n                                                 \n3 $1 = RM3.800 as of 31 December 2001. \n4 $1 = RM3.779 as of 31 December 2005. \n5 Danaharta ceased operations on 31 December 2005. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n3\n\nOne  feature  of  the  Malaysian  NPL  market  is  the  requirement  for  buyers  to  be  at  least \n11. \n51% domestically owned, meaning that any SPV established for an NPL transaction is limited to \n49% foreign ownership. Unlike in many other Asian markets, this has led to early involvement of \ndomestic  investor  groups,  rather  than  1-2  years  into  the  sales  cycle,  which  seems  to  be  the \nnorm. \n \n12. \nTo  date,  a  number  of  investor  groups  have  indicated  their  desire  to  acquire  portfolios \nand/or  large  single  credits.  However,  on  the  sell-side,  except  for  Maybank  (para.  8),  banking \ninstitutions are not rushing to sell. Clearly, the next 2 years will be critical in inducing buyers and \nsellers  into  the  Malaysian  NPL  market  and  establishing  Malaysia  as  a  fully  developed  NPL \nmarket. \n \nIn  December  2005,  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  teamed  up  with  Asia  Debt \n13. \nManagement  Hong  Kong  Limited  (ADM)  right  after  the  announcement  of  the  new  BNM \nGuidelines  on  NPLs  in  December.    A  joint  mission  was  scheduled  in  early  2006  to  explore \nopportunities, and the transaction proposed in this report and recommendation of the President \n(RRP) is a direct result of those efforts. \n \n\n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nBackground \n\n14. \nADM and HSBC have been in discussion as early as 2 years ago regarding the disposal \nof  HSBC\u2019s  Portfolio.  The  transaction  is  on  track  to  be  the  first  negotiated  NPL  deal  with  third- \nparty  debt  financing  in  Malaysia  to  reach  financial  close,  pursuant  to  BNM\u2019s  issuance  of \nGuidelines for NPLs, and is expected to help catalyze the fledgling NPL market in Malaysia.   \n \nB. \n\nThe Project Sponsors \n\n1. \n\nAsia Debt Management Hong Kong Limited \n\n15. \nADM,  founded  in  1996,  is  an  investment  advisor  registered  with  the  Hong  Kong \nSecurities and Futures Commission. ADM manages distressed assets and special situations in \nAsia,  Europe,  and  other  countries.  It  has  developed  a  strong  track  record  in  identifying  and \nsuccessfully  realizing  value  from  distressed  debt  opportunities  in  Asia,  and  is  one  of  Asia\u2019s \nleading  specialist  managers  of  Asian  distressed  assets.    ADM  has  also  developed  a  close \nnetwork  of  well-connected  local  partners  and  joint  ventures  in  India,  Indonesia,  Republic  of \nKorea,  Philippines,  and  Thailand  to  source  deal  opportunities  and  obtain  an  in-depth \nunderstanding of local market conditions.       \n \nSince  its  inception,  ADM  has  turned  over  in  excess  of  $3  billion  in  face  value  of \n16. \ndistressed  debt  and  has  been  directly  involved  in  restructuring  over  $2  billion  in  distressed \nassets.  ADM advises the open-ended Galleus Fund, which has received several awards as one \nof the best performing funds in its class and in Asia, and a series of closed-end Maculus funds \n(ADM  Maculus  Fund  I,  II,  and  III).  In  April  2007,  the  Asian  Investor  gave  the  Best  Distressed \nFund award to ADM Maculus Fund I, II, and III.  \n  \n17. \nof the Portfolio being sold. \n \n \n\nADM Maculus III (ADM III) will be the economic buyer, respectively the \u201cequity provider\u201d, \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\n2. \n\nHSBC Bank Malaysia Berhad \n\n18. \nHSBC Bank Malaysia Berhad (HSBC) is a wholly owned subsidiary of the HSBC Group, \none  of  the  largest  banking  and  financial  service  organizations  in  the  world.  Its  international \nnetwork  comprises  about  10,000  offices  in  82  countries  and  territories,  operating  in  the  Asia \nPacific region, Europe, the Americas, the Middle East, and Africa. \n \n19. \nHSBC\u2019s presence in Malaysia dates back to more than 120 years when the Hongkong \nand  Shanghai  Banking  Corporation  Limited  established  its  first  office  in  Penang  in  1884.  This \nwas followed by offices in Ipoh, Malacca, Johor Bahru, and Kuala Lumpur in 1910. Since then \nthe  bank  has  expanded  its  network  to  40  branches  nationwide  and  employs  approximately \n5,000 employees.    \n \n20. \nHSBC  was  incorporated  in  October  1984  and  was  the  first  foreign-owned  financial \ninstitution  to  be  localized  when  operations  were  transferred  from  the  Hongkong  and  Shanghai \nBanking  Corporation  Limited  in  January  1994.  HSBC\u2019s  pioneering  role  reflects  its  long-term \ncommitment  to  its  customers  and  to  Malaysia.  It  has  won  various  local  and  international \naccolades from FinanceAsia including Best Foreign Commercial Bank in Malaysia in 2005 and \nBest Foreign Bank in Malaysia in 2006. \n \n21. \n \nC. \n\nHSBC will be the seller of the Portfolio. \n\nServicer \n\nEstablished in 1998, ACAP is a financial services company based in Thailand focusing \n22. \nprimarily  on  loan  asset  management,  corporate  finance  advisory  and  rehabilitation  planning, \nand  administration.  ACAP  presently  employs  about  160  staff  located  in  its  two  offices  in \nBangkok.  \n \n23. \nACAP\u2019s Asset Management Division was established in 2004 to provide full servicing of \nnonperforming  loans  and  assets  for  client  owners  of  loan  portfolios.  Services  offered  include \ncontacting and negotiating with debtors, determining plans of action for each case, tracking loan \npayments, managing legal procedures, selling asset collateral, and maintaining a customer and \nloan  database.  Current  and  past  portfolios  managed  by  ACAP  amount  to  Thai  baht  54  billion \n($16 billion) in principal value. ACAP currently manages more than 35,000 loan accounts. \n  \n\nIV. \n\nTHE PROPOSED ADB INVESTMENT \n\nA. \n\nADB Investment \n\nADB is contemplating the provision of a senior secured loan (the Senior Loan) to EMSB \n24. \n(or a related entity) in an amount of up to $10 million. It is likely that the financing will be coursed \nthrough one of ADM\u2019s SPVs to ensure compliance with approvals that have been obtained by \nEMSB.  \n \n25. \nexceed $10 million or 50% of the total project cost, whichever is lower.  \n \n \n \n \n\nThe ADB investment will be financed from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources and will not \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n5\n\nB. \n\nMain Terms and Conditions \n\n26. \nThe  proposed  Senior  Loan  will  be  structured  as  a  senior  secured  debt  with  a  priority \nposition in collection proceeds received by EMSB under the Portfolio, whether from debt service \npayments  on  loan  assets,  rents  or  disposition  proceeds  on  foreclosed  assets,  interest  or \ninvestment income from other sources. \n \n\nV. \n\nINVESTMENT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND ASSUMPTIONS \n\nA. \n\nJustification of ADB\u2019s Investment \n\n1. \n\nInvestment Objective \n\nADB\u2019s  objective  is  to  assist  EMSB  in  acquiring  HSBC\u2019s  NPL  portfolio  through  the \n\n27. \nprovision of debt financing to fund the purchase price of the Portfolio. \n \n\n2. \n\nDevelopment Outcome \n\nThe proposed ADB investment will promote development at the following key levels. \n\n28. \n \n\n(i) \n\nCatalyze  the  Malaysian  NPL  market.  At  the  beginning  of  a  new  NPL  market, \nlocal lenders often are not available to provide third-party financing to investors. \nThis is, however, essential in a functioning market for NPL resolution and a key \nfeature  in  all  mature  markets.  By  providing  third-party  debt  financing  for  the \npurchase  of  NPLs  in  Malaysia,  lenders  such  as  ADB  are  able  to  bridge  the \npricing gap that prevents the sale of NPLs. Because investors can obtain loans at \nrates that are significantly less than their equity capital costs, they can pay more \nfor  NPLs  than  if  they  invested  on  an  all-equity  basis.  As  a  result,  ADB  can \ncontribute by helping local financial institutions recover higher market values from \ntheir distressed assets and make constructive efforts to remove such assets from \ntheir  books.  Experience  has  shown  that  over  time,  traditional  lenders  enter  the \nmarket and replace early NPL financiers eventually. Until such time, ADB  seeks \nto play a catalytic role in energizing the distressed asset market in Malaysia. By \nits  intervention,  ADB  will  demonstrate  the  credibility  of  this  asset  class  and \nmobilize capital to support similar efforts in Malaysia and throughout Asia.  \n \nProvide an NPL resolution demonstration effect. Through the execution of the \nfirst  negotiated  NPL  purchase  from  a  Malaysian  private  sector  bank  with  debt \nfinancing from a third party, ADB\u2019s proposed investment will help jump-start the \nMalaysian  NPL  market  by  implementing  bankable  NPL  sales  actually  reaching \nfinancial close.  The  Project  will  achieve  a  demonstration  effect  by  introducing  a \nreplicable, market-tested mechanism for NPL resolution that can be reproduced \nand  will  induce  the  development  of  the  NPL  market  in  Malaysia  (as  it  develops \nbenchmarks, bankable structures, and trust in the enabling legal and regulatory \nenvironment).  It  also  sends  a  strong  signal  to  Malaysian  banks  to  proactively \naddress their NPL problems.  \n \nCreate  a  best-practice  mortgage  NPL  servicing  entity  in  Malaysia.  With the \nsetting  up  of  the  ACAP  subsidiary  in  Malaysia,  the  first  best-practices  servicing \nplatform  for  nonperforming  mortgage  loans  will  be  created  in  the  country.  The \nACAP  platform  envisages  employment,  training,  and  utilization  of  a  number  of \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\n \n\nlocal professionals, who will augment the pool of available talent in the Malaysian \nfinancial sector.  \n\n3. \n\nValue Added of ADB \n\n29. \nADB\u2019s  participation  in  the  Project  will  be  highly  catalytic  and  demonstrative,  as  other \nfinancial institutions begin to enter the NPL market in Malaysia. With ADB being a critical force \nin supporting distressed debt sales in the region, ADB\u2019s presence in the transaction will add an \nextra level of confidence in Malaysia\u2019s fledgling NPL market. ADB is building on its very positive \nexperience in the Philippines, where similar interventions helped in jump-starting the Philippine \nNPL market, resulting in the reduction of NPL levels to the present 5.21%.  The transaction will \nbe one of the earliest transactions to come to market and thus, may serve as a benchmark for \nfuture  transactions  in  Malaysia.  The  success  of  this  transaction,  in  part  through  ADB\u2019s \nparticipation,  (i)  will  clearly  encourage  other  private  sector  players  to  engage  in  similar \ntransactions,  resulting  in  more  resources  and  expertise  to  be  channeled  toward  viable  NPL \nresolution in Malaysia; and (ii) would position Malaysia as one of the major focus countries for \nNPL investors in Asia in the coming years.   \n \n\n4. \n\nDesign and Monitoring Framework \n\nADB  has  prepared  a  design  and  monitoring  framework  and  will  measure  the  expected \n30. \ndevelopment  impact  of  the  investment,  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  management  development \nresults policy (Appendix 12). \n\n \n5. \n\nFit to Sector and Country Strategy \n\na. \n\nSector Strategy \n\nA sound and efficient financial sector is a prerequisite for broad-based, private sector-led \n31. \neconomic  development  that  will  directly  contribute  to  poverty  reduction.  ADB,  recognizing  that \nthe recovery of lending activities in the financial sector is vital to this goal, has made assistance \nto address the overhang of NPLs in both public and private financial institutions as  one of its \nkey thrusts.  \n \n32. \nADB\u2019s  proposed  participation  in  the  transaction  will  build  on  its  strategy  of  helping  its \ndeveloping  member  countries  tackle  the  burden  of  distressed  assets  and  NPLs,  and  build  a \nsound and efficient financial sector. For example, in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), ADB \nhelped  the  Cinda  Asset  Management  Corporation  (Cinda)  deal  with  NPLs.  ADB  technical \nassistance  (TA) 6  was  given  immediately  after  Cinda  was  established  in  2001  to  (i)  provide \nCinda  with  the  technology  to  complete  its  mandate  to  undertake  financial  and  corporate \nrestructuring  of  companies  whose  assets  were  foreclosed,  (ii)  equip  Cinda  with  the  latest \ntechniques  used  for  the  purchase  and  disposition  of  NPLs  to  achieve  sufficient  returns  from \nfunds  injected  to  acquire  NPLs,  and  (iii)  help  Cinda  implement  appropriate  management \ninformation  systems.  The  TA  has  quickly  established  Cinda  operationally  and  provided  broad \nrecommendations on various legal and regulatory issues to policy makers in the Government of \nthe PRC. A second TA7 was approved to assist in developing an effective and comprehensive \nlegal,  regulatory,  and  policy  framework  for  asset-backed  securities  (ABS)  transactions  by \n                                                 \n6 ADB. 2001.

In  India,  ADB  provided  a \nTA to enable and structure asset reconstruction companies.8\n \n33. \nThrough  its  private  sector  operations,  ADB  was  highly  instrumental  in  laying  the \ngroundwork for creating and developing an NPL market in the Philippines (paras. 74\u201379).   ADB \nwas also involved in the ADM Maculus I and Maculus II funds, the Yangtze Special Situations \nFund (PRC) and the formation of Actis Asset Reconstruction Company (India). \n \nThe Philippine NPL Market. In 2005, ADB supported the auction of the National Home \n34. \nMortgage  Finance  Corporation\u2019s  (NHMFC)  portfolio  of  delinquent  nonperforming  mortgage \nloans by providing debt financing of up to $33 million to Balikatan Housing, Inc. (Balikatan), the \nSPV jointly owned by a Deutsche Bank fund (DBGO) and NHMFC. Balikatan acquired the NPLs \nfrom NHMFC and is subsequently resolving them. ADB also invested in a 10% equity stake in \nBahay  Financial  Services,  Inc.  (BFS),  a  loan  servicing  company  that  was  set  up  by  DBGO  to \nrestructure and service the NPLs on behalf of Balikatan.  \n \nADB was involved in the transaction from the very beginning, working alongside NHMFC \n35. \nand  its  external  advisors  in  putting  together  a  bankable  structure.  Given  the  difficulty  of \nobtaining  local  or  international  debt  financing  for  a  new  and  untested  asset  class  at  the  time, \nADB  played  a  critical  role  by  providing  third-party  financing  support.  That  ADB  made  such \nfinancing  available  helped  to  encourage  DBGO\u2019s  participation  and  set  a  precedent  for  them. \nFurthermore, by introducing a debt layer into the capital structure of the project, ADB  was able \nto increase the cash purchase price paid by DBGO to NHMFC, as this allowed DBGO to submit \na bid on a leveraged basis (versus on a total equity basis), given that local lenders were not yet \nready  to  enter  this  type  of  market.  Without  ADB\u2019s  offer  of  support,  the  pricing  gap  between \nNHMFC\u2019s  reserve  price  and  DBGO\u2019s  bid  price  might  not  have  been  bridged,and  could  have \ncaused  the  auction  to  fail.  ADB\u2019s  support  in  the  early  stages  of  the  transaction  also  lent \ncredibility  and  provided  considerable  comfort  to  the  potential  investors  that  the  sale  of  the \nPortfolio  would  be  implemented  with  transparency  and  in  accordance  with  international \nstandards and best practices. \n \n36. \nADB\u2019s  ongoing  involvement  as  a  shareholder  in  BFS  also  ensures  best  practices  and \ncredibility  to  the  company\u2019s  operations  as  it  services  and  resolves  the  portfolio.    BFS\u2019 \nperformance  in  its  first  year  of  operations  has  been  very  positive;  it  collected  $14.5  million \nversus a target of $6.3 million.  Given that these cash flows are a result of BFS\u2019 \u201ctouching\u201d only \n23% of the portfolio, such performance is expected to continue or improve further once BFS is \nable to \u201ctouch\u201d the remaining 77% of the portfolio. BFS has its head office in Makati, and plans \nto establish a branch in Alabang, Muntinlupa, are under way to better service accounts.  BFS is \nalso  expected  to  employ  a  total  of  300  staff  by  the  end  of  its  second  year  as  it  ramps  up  its \noperations.   \n \n37. \nADB\u2019s participation in the NHMFC transaction was highly catalytic and demonstrative, as \nother  financial  institutions  entered  the  NPL  market  in  the  Philippines  shortly  thereafter.  The \nsuccess  of  this  landmark  transaction,  in  part  through  ADB\u2019s  participation,  clearly  encouraged \nother private sector players to engage in similar transactions, resulting in more resources and \nexpertise  channeled  toward  viable  NPL  resolution  and  housing  finance  sector  reform  in  the \nPhilippines.  This  outcome  was  recognized  in  the  Office  of  Evaluation  Department\u2019s  study  on \nADB\u2019s operations in the Philippines.  \n\n                                                 \n8  ADB.  2004.

ADB\u2019s loan was repaid \nwithin  a  year,  ahead  of  projections.  Since  then,  HVB  has  been  an  active  participant  in  the \nPhilippine NPL market and acquired a number of NPL portfolios from several local banks.   \n \n39. \nBoth  transactions  in  which  ADB  participated  helped  generate  considerable  momentum \nfor the Philippine NPL market, which has become one of the most active in Asia in recent years.  \nIn  addition,  the  banking  sector\u2019s  NPL  ratio  stood  at  5.21%  as  of  end-June  2007,  an \nimprovement from the 7.22% NPL ratio registered a year ago, and a significant decline from the \ndouble-digit  NPL  levels  after  the  Asian  crisis.  ADB  is  determined  to  repeat  this  positive \nexperience in other markets.   \n \n\nb. \n\nCountry Strategy  \n\nFollowing  the  Asian  financial  crisis  in  the  late  1990s,  Malaysia  largely  eschewed \n40. \nborrowing  from  multilateral  assistance  sources.  No  new  loans  from  ADB  had  been  approved \nsince  1998.  ADB  has  not  prepared  an  operational  strategy  for  Malaysia  since  July  1997.  \nHowever, the proposed transaction would be in line with the Government of Malaysia\u2019s efforts in \nencouraging  its  financial  institutions  to  resolve  significant  portions  of  existing  NPL  stock  in  its \nbooks, and the Government\u2019s ongoing efforts to effectively deregulate and liberalize its capital \nmarket.  \n \nB. \n\nSocial and Environmental Safeguard Policies \n\n41. \nThe  proposed  investment  is  classified  as  Category  C  for  environmental  and  social \nsafeguard classifications.

For  Asia  as  a  whole,  the \npresence of large numbers of companies that have defaulted weighs heavily on the banking and \nfinancial system.  Even  in  cases  where  bad  debts  have  been  sold  or  have  been  transferred  to \nasset management companies, the presence of large numbers of distressed companies weigh \nheavily  on  the  economy  as  they  are  relatively  unproductive.  In  some  cases,  the  optimum \nsolution may be closure, but in most cases the underlying companies continue to be productive \nand recover strongly once the weight of bad debt is removed.  \n \n2. \nThe Asian development experience has shown that growth is one of the most powerful \nweapons in the fight against poverty. Growth creates the need for labor, the main asset of the \npoor. As growth continues, private sector employment becomes the major source of economic \nsupport  for  the  majority  of  workers  and  their  families.  Growth  also  broadens  the  tax  base, \nenabling governments to finance social services such as health and education.1  \n \nTo restore the health of the banking industry in the targeted countries, it is necessary to \n3. \nwork on corporate restructuring as was the case with the success of the Republic of Korea after \nthe financial crisis of 1997. Vulnerability in the banking system and the economy is a result of \nrapid  growth  that  outpaced  the  establishment  of  sound  regulation,  the  building  of  institutional \ncapacities,  and  formulation  of  sound  corporate  governance  principles.  The  development  of  a \nsound and efficient financial sector is a prerequisite for broad-based private sector-led economic \ndevelopment  that  will  contribute  to  poverty  reduction.  Not  addressing  the  problem  of \nnonperforming  loans  (NPLs)  would  translate  into  a  further  drain  on  future  resources  and \npotential earnings and impair capital significantly. As credit costs increase to cover the cost of \nNPL  losses,  financial  institutions  resist  making  fresh  loans.  Tighter  credit  restricts  economic \ngrowth as enterprises are unable to access capital. Selling NPLs will alleviate these problems \nand help stimulate economic growth in the respective countries. \n \n4. \nThe  benefits  of  resolving  an  NPL  crisis  are  well-proven,  judging  from  the  success  of \ncountries  outside  of  Asia,  for  instance,  the  US  or  Sweden  (both  of  which  of  course  had  other \nsupporting factors).  In those countries, once the level of NPLs dropped, the national economy \nbegan to recover and grow; companies and businesses started creating new jobs; and investors, \nnow  more  confident  of  a  country\u2019s  long-term  growth  prospects,  began  to  pump  investment \ncapital into the country\u2019s stock, bond, and property markets as well as individual companies and \nbusinesses.  \n\n                                                 \n1 ADB. 2000.

The parties to these contracts include shareholders, creditors, managers, employees, \nsuppliers,  and  customers\u2014in  other  words,  anyone  who  has  a  claim  on  the  firm\u2019s  profits  and \ncash flows. Therefore, restructuring is the process by which firms change these contracts. What \nusually  drives  firms  to  restructure  is  some  opportunity  to  increase  their  market  value. \nRestructuring can be very costly, however, so the value gap must be large enough to make it \nworthwhile.  \n \n2. \nOne of the most compelling reasons to restructure is to address poor performance, i.e., \nto  address  losses  in  market  value  caused  by  poor  performance  or  financial  distress.  Such \nlosses may or may not be the management\u2019s fault: the management may have overdiversified \ninto too many businesses or borrowed too aggressively. On the other hand, the firm\u2019s problems \ncould be caused by an economic recession or an adverse change in currency exchange rates \n(the two other main reasons for restructuring are to pursue strategic opportunities or to correct \nvaluation errors). \n \nB. \n \n3. \nThere  are  a  number  of  ways  to  resolve  unsustainable  corporate  debt.  The  usual \nresponse  would  be  for  the  company  to  raise  new  equity,  if  possible,  and/or  undertake \n\u201coperational restructuring\u201d (e.g., discontinue less profitable or loss-incurring businesses, lay off  \nexcess  labor,  and  reduce  other  costs  to  increase  the  company\u2019s  earnings  and  debt  service \ncapacity, plus sell noncore businesses and assets\u2014such as real estate\u2014to retire debt).  \n \n4. \nIf it appears that operational restructuring cannot reduce corporate debt to a sustainable \nlevel, or that stopgap liquidity is needed prior to such action, \u201cfinancial restructuring\u201d becomes \nappropriate. For example, creditors, either new or existing, could convert debt into equity and/or \ninto lower-yielding corporate bonds, which usually requires a loss or \u201chaircut\u201d with regard to the \noriginal  terms  of  the  to-be  restructured  debt  (through  a  reduction  of  principal  or  by  forgiving \ninterest/penalties or extending the maturity of the facility).  \n \nThe mix and sequencing of such operational and financial restructuring measures for a \n5. \ndistressed  company  will  depend  on  the  severity  of  the  company\u2019s  problems  and  differences \namong  the  interested  parties.  In  essence,  if  the  company\u2019s  underlying  business  is  nonviable, \nliquidation  is  appropriate.  However,  if  the  company  is  viable,  albeit  overindebted,  financial \nand/or corporate restructuring presents the best route forward. \n \n\nOverview of Restructuring \n\n                                                 \n1  This  section  is  a  summary  of  current  research  on  the  benefits  of  corporate  and  financial  restructuring  from  the \nfollowing sources: ADB. 2000.

Firms may have low incentives to restructure \nbecause other distressed firms\u2014and, by implication, consumers\u2014have a low demand for their \nproducts. Also, distressed firms are unable to repay debts, maintaining the pressure on financial \ninstitutions,  which,  in  turn,  restrict  new  lending  that  may  be  required  to  revive  sectors  where \neffective demand exists. Financial institutions may become insolvent, reducing the incentive of \nborrowers to repay loans. The judicial system will be overwhelmed with cases and will have  no \nmechanism to prioritize which case to treat first.  \n \n8. \nTo  break  out  of  this  vicious  cycle,  on  a  macro-economic  level  three  approaches  have \nbeen employed. The first strategy is to depend on economic recovery to release the constraint \non demand, thus improving cash flows and the repayment ability of firms. Such recovery can be \nengineered  by  increased  government  spending  but  may  be  limited  by  fiscal  constraints, \nparticularly in times of systemic distress. Recovery may also occur if the demand for exports is \nbuoyant, as was the case in Mexico after the 1994\u20131995 crisis and in the Republic of Korea and \nMalaysia following the recent Asian crisis, with both countries benefiting from rapid growth in the \ntrade  of  electronics  products.  However,  reliance  on  an  economic  upturn  may  be  na\u00efve,  as \nevidenced by the continued stagnation of the corporate sector in Japan over the last decade.  \n \nFurthermore,  economic  recovery  by  itself  has  proven  to  be  insufficient in  countries  like \n9. \nIndonesia  and  Thailand,  where  more  than  half  of  the  corporate  sector  was  at  one  point \nexperiencing distress. Many firms were in distress, not just because of an economy-wide crisis \nbut  because  imprudent  investment  decisions  had  been  made.  The  evidence  shows  that  the \ndistress of such firms and financial institutions persists for long periods, rendering the economy \nvulnerable to renewed financial pressures.  \n \n10. \nFor this reason, the next set of alternatives is a variety of market-based measures, which \nneed not require any fiscal layouts. Under this approach, the government sets the rules under \nwhich  creditors  and  debtors  work  out  their  claims  in  a  decentralized  manner.  These  rules \ninclude rules governing normal restructuring and bankruptcy; enhanced measures for resolving \nfinancial  claims  (through  special  rules  or  moral  suasion  that  supplements  existing  bankruptcy \nprocedures);  reduction  of  barriers  to  transfer  of  ownership  and  redeployment  of  resources \n(including more liberal foreign direct investment, mergers and acquisitions, and greater mobility \nin labor markets); and \u201csuper-bankruptcy\u201d processes that, once again, change the incentives for \nthe restructuring of claims.  \n \n11. \nThe  common  feature  of  these  decentralized  approaches,  whether  normal  creditor-led \nworkouts,  enhanced  \u201cmarket-based,\u201d  or  super-bankruptcy  approaches,  is  that  they  rely  on \nincentives and penalties for restructuring rather than on either government fiscal stimuli\u2014as in \nthe  case  of  an  engineered  recovery\u2014or  on  the  assumption  by  the  government  of  financial \nliabilities of bankrupt firms and financial institutions. In some cases, however, where economic \nrecovery and enhanced incentives for restructuring are insufficient, governments may face the \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n13\n\nassumption of financial liabilities or provide other forms of government support to shore up the \nfinancial  or  corporate  sectors.  Related  to  that  is  the  degree  to  which  governments  should \nexercise  regulatory  forbearance  on  financial  institutions  in  distress.  Where  governments  do \nexpend fiscal resources and assume nonperforming loans, they also seek to recover some part \nof  those  resources  through  centralized  asset  management  companies.  In  practice,  the \ndependence  on  economic  recovery,  sharper  incentives  and  tougher  penalties,  and  the \nassumption  of  financial  liabilities  go  together.  This  is  demonstrated  by  a  variety  of  country \nexamples. It is thus difficult to isolate the effects and benefits of pursuing an economic-recovery-\nonly approach.  \n \n12. \nSome lessons on systemic restructuring have also become clear. There is a need to limit \nthe government\u2019s role in establishing the enabling environment (insolvency, tax, accounting, etc., \neventually  providing  resources)  for  the  private  sector  to  do  the  necessary  restructuring.  It  has \nalso  become  clear  that  it  is  important  to  adjust  the  approach  to  the  type  of  assets,  which  are \ncausing  the  distress.  To  the  extent  that  the  government  directly  intervenes  in  systemic \nrestructurings,  it  should  be  careful  on  how  it  deals  with  \u201closers\u201d  (particularly  banks  and  other \nfinancial institutions). \n \n\n \n\n2. \n\nMarket-Led Approaches to Restructuring II: More Benefits, Less Cost \n\nA market-led approach to restructuring has, in principle, three main attractions. First, by \n13. \ndrawing on private rather than public resources to facilitate restructuring, it helps limit costs to \nthe  taxpayer.  Equitable  cost-sharing  arrangements  under  a  market-led  approach  should  help \nmitigate problems of moral hazard and create incentives for more efficient monitoring. Second, \na market-led approach generally works better in recovering the value of nonperforming and bad \nloans than a bureaucratically administered system. Competition in the acquisition and disposal \nof  assets  should  eventually  make  for  more  efficient  debt  workouts.  Finally,  a  market-led \napproach  should  enhance  systemic  efficiency  and  safety.  These  benefits  follow  if  market \nplayers who are better capitalized and managed are able to increase their market share at the \nexpense of those that are weak and are a potential threat to system stability. \n \n14. \nCorporate  difficulties  may  be  resolved  by  the  market  or  within  special-purpose \nframeworks  intended  to  ease  coordination  problems.  Market  solutions  entail  mergers, \nacquisitions,  and  bankruptcies  within  an  established  framework  of  company  law.  Special- \npurpose frameworks may be either voluntary or compulsory. Voluntary frameworks are usually \npreferred since they provide an opportunity for the rehabilitation of asset values and a recovery \nof  debt.  The  role  of  such  agencies  is  crucial  when  there  are  many  interlocking  debtors  and \ncreditors.  Negotiations  among  these  parties  are  usually  guided  by  a  set  of  well-defined  rules. \nThese  would  normally  assert  creditors\u2019  rights,  while  providing  some  breathing  space  during \nwhich businesses enjoy a stay on their debt. The rules are likely to require that debtors submit \nplans  for  financial  and operational restructuring  to  creditors  for  their  approval.  To  help  resolve \ncoordination  problems,  majority  voting  on  these  and  other  matters  is  the  norm.  To  the  extent \nthat voluntary arrangements work, both debtors and creditors should benefit. If they fail, or if  no \nagreement  can  be  reached,  resolution  of  debts  would  normally  occur  through  bankruptcy \nproceedings.  Therefore,  for  voluntary  arrangements  to  work  there  should  also  be  a  credible \nthreat  of  action  under  binding  foreclosure  and  bankruptcy  procedures.  If  these  do  not  exist, \nvoluntary frameworks are unlikely to achieve much. Normally, some combination of market and \nspecial-purpose frameworks for debt resolution will be applied. \n \n \n\n \n\n\f14 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n3. \n\nRestructuring: Prevention and Resolution of Financial Crisis \n\n15.  Weaknesses in the financial and corporate sectors were at the heart of the Asian crisis. \nIn  a  situation  where  rapid  financial  liberalization  had  outpaced  institutional  capacities, \nvulnerabilities accumulated and put at risk the solvency of large parts of the affected economies. \nInadequate regulation, weak supervision of financial institutions, poor accounting standards and \ndisclosure  rules,  outmoded  laws,  corporate  recklessness,  and  inferior  governance  all  played \ntheir  part.  Together,  these  factors  seemed  to  legitimize  investor  panic  that  culminated  in  the \ndisorderly  collapse  of  asset  prices  and  exchange  rates.  Prompted  in  part  by  the  terms  of \ninternational assistance packages, the affected economies have now embarked on the complex \nand time-consuming task of tackling these institutional deficits.  \n \nStanley  Fischer,  formerly  of  the  International  Monetary  Fund  and  now  with  Citigroup, \n16. \ndescribed the importance of corporate restructuring, particularly in the aftermath of a crisis, as a \nvital  accompaniment  to  banking  restructuring:  \u201cAt  this  stage,  bank  and  corporate  debt \nrestructuring should be closely coordinated, but often are not because of lack of capacity, data, \nand  sheer  complexity  of  the  banks.  Bank  restructuring  cannot  take  place  in  isolation  from \ncorporate restructuring.\u201d  \n \n17. \nInstruments  designed  to  mitigate  the  severity  of  bubbles  as  well  as  support  remedial \nmeasures to deal with their aftereffects include a secondary market for debt, corporate financial \nrestructuring  funds,  corporate  restructuring  vehicles,  real  estate  investment  trusts,  and \nsecuritization.  Two  of  the  products\u2014corporate  financial  restructuring  funds  and  corporate \nrestructuring  vehicles\u2014were  successfully  used  in  Korea  after  1997,  which  sought  to  develop \nmarket  solutions  to  facilitate  the  restructuring  process  in  the  aftermath  of  the  Asian  financial \ncrisis. The Korean initiative might serve as a model for other countries. \n \n\n4. \n\nRestructuring: Acceleration of Local Financial Competency \n\n18. \nProvided  that  a  country  has  a  rich  set  of  financial  sector  skills,  it  can  develop  a  wider \nrange of investment and risk management mechanisms that can help transfer liquidity, market, \nand  credit  risks  and  thereby  dampen  the  volatility  of  the  financial  system.  The  prerequisite  is \nthat,  in  order  to  develop  sophisticated  financial  market  instruments,  countries  first  need  to \nacquire a base of human capital.  \n \n19. \nSimilar  to  service  sector  skills,  market-based  instruments  play  an  important  role  in \nmitigating  the  magnitude  of  bubbles  as  well  as  in  expediting  the  mop-up  process.  In  the \naftermath of the Asian crisis, there is increasing recognition of the importance of corporate and \nfinancial  sector  restructuring  and  the  challenges  that  restructuring  poses  in  the  absence  of \nskilled financial sector expertise. It is believed that the buildup, duration, and severity of bubbles \nin  equity  and  real  estate  markets,  as  well  as  the  restructuring  that  occurs  in  the  aftermath  of \nsuch bubbles, are related to the availability of skills in financial sector services. Countries that \nhave  capable  professionals  such  as  appraisers,  analysts,  and  insolvency  experts  have \nrecognized and responded more swiftly to asset bubbles than countries with a limited base  of \nskills  in  the  financial  sector.  In  addition,  countries  benefit  from  the  development  of  market \ninstruments that spread risks, such as secondary markets in distressed debt. \n \n\n5. \n\nPublic Policy Considerations \n\n20. \nAccording  to  academic  and  multilateral  researchers,  policy  measures  directed  at \ndeveloping  market-based  instruments  in  distressed  debt  and  corporate restructuring  funds  are \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n15\n\nneeded  to  bring  greater  transparency,  efficiency,  and  liquidity  to  emerging  markets.  Policy \nmakers need to remove the legal impediments to the development of a market for securitization \nthrough  legislation  enabling  a  legal  structure  for  trusts,  tax  neutrality,  and  amendments  to  the \ninsolvency legislation. Similarly, development of standard documentation for trading distressed \ncorporate  loans  will  lead  to  greater  consistency,  transparency,  and  therefore  liquidity  in  the \ndistressed  debt  market.  To  avoid  moral  hazard,  the  new  set  of  creditors  should  retain  some \nequity  instrument  (e.g.,  convertible  bonds,  debt-equity  swaps,  options,  or  warrants)  to \nparticipate  in  any  recovery  while  placing  pressure  on  existing  equity  holders  to  enforce \nimprovement measures. Term extensions may be acceptable, so long as they do not have the \npractical  effect  of  transforming  debt  into  an  equity-like  instrument  without  also  giving  creditors \nthe  rights  of  equity  holders.  Reducing  interest  below  the  risk-adjusted  rate  may  also  be \nacceptable, so long as the principal is repaid. \n \nD. \n \n\nCost of Restructuring \n\n1. \n\nCost of Restructuring and Value Creation \n\n21. \nFrom  an  economic  perspective,  debt  restructuring  is  almost  always  preferred  over \nbankruptcy, as it is the less costly alternative, particularly when the firm in question remains a \nviable going concern. Every restructuring impacts the firm\u2019s market value for the same reason. \nThere are certain market frictions or institutional rigidities that make it difficult for the firm to re-\ncontract. Such frictions\u2014called \u201cmarket imperfections\u201d\u2014include transaction costs, agency costs, \ninformation costs, and taxes. \n \nTransaction costs include all costs (both out-of-pocket costs and forgone opportunities) \n22. \nthat firms incur when they restructure (e.g., fees in a bankruptcy reorganization and severance \npayments  to  employees  laid  off  in  a  downsizing  program).  Agency  costs  include  the  loss  in \nmarket  value  when  managers  take  actions  that  benefit  themselves  but  harm  shareholders. \nThese costs also include the costs to shareholders of trying to prevent managers from behaving \nthis  way.  Information  costs  include  the  costs  to  investors  of  acquiring  and  processing \ninformation about the firm\u2019s activities and opportunities. In practice, these costs can be lowered \nby  the  activities  of  financial  analysts,  who  provide  expert  commentary  and  analysis  about \ncompanies to investors. \n \n23. \nFinally,  taxes\u2014both  corporate  and  personal\u2014are  a  critical  concern  in  almost  every \nrestructuring.  If  a  firm  wishes  to  rid  itself  of  a  business  division  (e.g.,  for  strategic  reasons),  a \ncorporate spin-off can avoid the onerous tax liability created by an outright cash sale. A firm that \nreorganizes in Chapter  11  3may choose to keep its debt level relatively  high, because issuing \nnew  stock may  limit  its  ability  to  use  its  net  operating  loss  carry  forwards.  Understanding  how \nthese  factors  can  impact  market  value  in  a  particular  situation  is  critical  for  successfully \nmanaging the restructuring process, addressing the firm\u2019s problems, and creating value. \n \n\n2. \n\nBankruptcy Costs \n\nInvesting  in  distressed  situations  involves  purchasing  the  financial  claims  of  firms  that \n24. \nhave filed for legal bankruptcy protection or else are trying to avoid bankruptcy by negotiations \nand  out-of-court  restructuring  with  their  creditors.  The  show  case  is  the  United  States  (US), \nwhere  corporate  bankruptcy  reorganizations  take  place  under  Chapter  11  of  the  U.S. \nBankruptcy Code. \n\n                                                 \n3 United States Code Title 11 (Bankruptcy Code). 1994. Reorganization. \n\n \n\n\f16 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n \n25. \nAn  out-of-court  restructuring  can  almost  always  be  accomplished  at  much  lower  cost \nthan a court-supervised reorganization. Part of this difference reflects savings in legal and other \nadministrative  costs.  More  importantly,  Chapter  11  or  similar  bankruptcy  regimes  generally \nimpose  a  much  heavier  burden  on  the  business  because  of  the  greater  demands  placed  on \nmanagement\u2019s  time  and  costly  delays  engendered  by  litigation.  Consistent  with  this  cost \ndifferential, academic research4 has found that firms that successfully restructure their debt out \nof  court  experience  significant  increases  in  their  common  stock  price  (approximately  30%,  on \naverage,  after  adjusting  for  risk  and  market  movements)  from  the  time  they  first  experience \nfinancial distress to when they complete their restructuring. Over a corresponding interval, firms \nthat  try  to  restructure  out  of  court  but  fail  experience  significant  average  stock  price  declines \n(also in the order of 30%). \n \n26. \nSeveral studies have measured the costs of the reorganization process. Warner (1977) \nand  Weiss  (1990)  conclude  that  the  direct  out-of-pocket  costs  of  Chapter  11  (including \nprofessionals\u2019  fees,  court  filing  fees,  etc.)  are  less  than  5%  of  corporate  assets,  on  average. \nHowever,  these  costs  are  proportionately  much  higher  for  smaller  firms.  Altman  (1984),  Opler \nand  Titman  (1994),  and  Kaplan  and  Andrade  (1999)  attempt  to  measure  the  business  losses \ncaused  by  bankruptcy  (for  example,  potential  customers  or  suppliers  may  be  reluctant  to  do \nbusiness  with  a  bankrupt  firm.)  These  costs  are  potentially  much  larger  than  out-of-pocket \nbankruptcy  costs,  but  measuring  them  is  difficult  because  business  losses  may  be  the  cause, \nrather  than  the  consequence,  of  bankruptcy.  The  studies  conclude  that  these  additional  costs \naverage  roughly  10%\u201325%  of  firms\u2019  stock  market  values  before  bankruptcy  and  that  highly \nleveraged  firms  suffer  greater  losses  of  business  than  less  leveraged  firms  during  industry \ndownturns. Gilson, John, and Lang (1990) show that direct costs are significantly lower in out-\nof-court restructuring than in Chapter 11. This cost advantage gives most firms an incentive to \nrestructure out of court if they can. An alternative restructuring option that has gained popularity \nrecently  is  \u201cprepackaged\u201d  Chapter  11,  which  allows  firms  to  reorganize  in  Chapter  11  more \nquickly. Tashjian, Leas, and McConnell (1996) show that the costs of prepackaged Chapter 11 \nare midway between the costs of conventional Chapter 11 and out-of-court restructuring. \n \n\na. \n\nStock Prices and Long-Run Performance \n\n27. \nAhorony,  Jones,  and  Swary  (1980)  show  that  when  firms  file  for  bankruptcy,  their \ncommon  stock  prices  decline  significantly,  on  average  (controlling  for  differences  in  firms\u2019  risk \nand market movements). Moreover, for up to 5 years before they enter bankruptcy, firms\u2019 stock \nprices  significantly  underperform  in  the  market.  Gilson,  John,  and  Lang  (1990)  document  that \nwhen  distressed  firms  successfully  restructure  their  debt  out  of  court,  their  risk-adjusted  stock \nprices  increase  by  over  40%,  on  average,  from  the  time  they  first  default  on  their  debt.  In \ncontrast, firms that file for Chapter 11 suffer an average 40% stock price decline. This difference \nsuggests that for most firms, it is significantly less costly to resolve financial distress out of court. \nHotchkiss  (1995)  shows  that  after  firms  leave  Chapter  11,  they  tend  to  be  significantly  less \nprofitable  than  the  average  for  their  industries.  Consistent  with  Hotchkiss,  Gilson  (1997)  finds \nthat roughly one in four companies that reorganize in Chapter 11 subsequently has to return to \nbankruptcy court (as so-called \u201cChapter 22s\u201d) because they either continue to perform poorly or \nleave Chapter 11 with too much debt. \n \n                                                 \n4  See Gilson, Stuart,  Kose John, and Larry Lang. 1990.

This rule, \nwhich  has  to  be  followed  in  a  liquidation,  states  that  no  creditor  or  shareholder  can  receive \nanything  of  value  under  a  restructuring  plan  unless  all  more  senior  claimholders  have  been \nmade whole. Absolute priority deviations typically mean that shareholders receive something of \nvalue in a restructuring, even though the firm is insolvent. This outcome is a by-product of the \nUS system, which encourages consensual reorganization of distressed firms. In other countries, \nwhere  liquidation  is  more  common  or  shareholders  do  not  get  to  vote  on  the  restructuring, \nabsolute priority is more likely to be observed. As for how firms resolve financial distress, Gilson, \nJohn,  and  Lang  (1990)  find  that  most  distressed  large  public  companies  are  successfully \nreorganized\u2014approximately half the time in Chapter 11 and half the time out of court. Firms that \nare able to restructure out of court typically have less complex capital structures, higher growth \nopportunities,  and  more  bank  debt.  Finally,  Gilson,  Hotchkiss,  and  Ruback  (2000)  show  that \nclaimholders\u2019 relative recoveries in Chapter 11 strongly depend on how disputes over the firm\u2019s \nvalue are resolved. \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\f18 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\nSALIENT POINTS ON BANK NEGARA MALAYSIA\u2019S \u201cGUIDELINES FOR THE SALE OF \nNPLs BY BANKING INSTITUTIONS\u201d \n\nLosses arising from sales cannot be amortized. \n\nThe SPVs must be locally incorporated and tax resident. \n\nSales  to  third  parties  must  be  on  a  without-recourse  basis,  while  sales  to  same-group \n\nSeller  institutions  can  act  as  service  agents  after  the  sale,  subject  to  an  arrangement \n\nEquity  participation  by  foreign  investors  is  permissible  in  both  types  of  SPV,  but \n\nNPLs  that  can  be  sold  include  corporate,  small-  and  medium-sized  enterprises  (SME), \n\n \n1. \nOutright  sale  is  allowed  to  either  eligible  third  parties  or  to  special-purpose  vehicles \n(SPVs) within the seller bank group.
