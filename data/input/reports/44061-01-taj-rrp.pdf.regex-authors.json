I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed grant \nto the Republic of Tajikistan for the Strengthening Public Resource Management Program. The \nreport also describes proposed technical assistance (TA) to support implementation of program \nreforms, and if the Board approves the program, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by \nthe Board, will approve the TA. \n \n2.  The program aims to strengthen public resource management in Tajikistan through \nimproved tax policy and administration, more effective and efficient social safety net programs, \nand improved public financial management.1 \n \nII.  THE PROGRAM \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Tajikistan recovered from the economic impacts of the global financial crisis, supported \nby (i) the Government of Tajikistan\u2019s anti-crisis program;2 (ii) a rebound in remittances (18% \nyear-on-year in 2010) resulting principally from the economic upturn in the Russian Federation; \nand (iii) higher global prices for aluminum and cotton, which represented 83% of total exports in \n2010. However, while the real gross domestic product (GDP) growth rate for 2010 was 6.5%\u2014\nan increase from 3.4% in 2009\u2014it is still below the 7.4% average growth experienced in 2005\u2013\n2008 (Table 1). Recovery continues to be affected by tighter credit to the private sector due to \ngrowing stress in the banking system,3 and the recent hike in imported food prices. These \nfactors are likely to continue restraining real GDP growth in 2011 (forecast at 5.5%) and 2012 \n(forecast at 6.0%). Recovery also remains dependent on sustained economic recovery in the \nRussian Federation, based on Tajikistan\u2019s reliance on trade and remittance inflows. (See the \neconomic and financial analysis and country economic indicators).4 \n \n4.  Increases in salaries and pensions and higher international commodity prices are expected \nto  keep  inflation  levels  high  (10.0%  estimated  for  2011,  close  to  the  9.8%  figure  of  2010).5 \nUnemployment also remains high (11.5% in 2009), and close to 1 million Tajiks, or about 40% of the \nworkforce, work abroad.6 Remittances from migrant workers are the main source of income of many \nfamilies, averaging 41.1% of GDP in 2005\u20132009. Tajikistan remains the poorest country in the \nCommonwealth of Independent States, with the lowest per capita GDP ($1,900 in 2009) and the \nlowest per capita social expenditures. The weak social protection system offers limited social \nassistance benefits with little impact on poverty. Fiscal spending on social assistance (0.5% of \nGDP) is the lowest in Central Asia.7 Although declining steadily since 1999, poverty remains high, \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  Following a fiscal plan, approved in April 2009, to limit the impact of the global financial crisis, the government has \nbeen using fiscal policy to stabilize the macroeconomic situation, promote job creation, and sustain social \nprograms that protect the most vulnerable social groups. \n3  While the government\u2019s decision to write off nearly $500 million of outstanding cotton credits that were hindering \nthe banking sector reduced the rate of nonperforming loans from 28% by the end of 2009, nonperforming loans \nremain high, at about 18% in 2010. \n4  Economic and Financial Analysis and Country Economic Indicators (accessible from list of linked documents in \nAppendix 2). \n5  The 2011 and 2012 figures for GDP, inflation, and current account balance are staff\u2019s preliminary forecasts for the \nforthcoming Asian Development Outlook 2011. \n6  The labor migration of (mostly) men leads to an increase in households headed by women, which results in \nchanges in gender roles. Women are increasingly dependent on state subsidies. \n7  World Bank. 2009. Republic of Tajikistan: Poverty Assessment. Washington, DC. \n ", "2 \nespecially in isolated rural and mountainous areas, where about 70% of the people are poor. In \n2007, 53% of the country\u2019s population was living below the poverty line of $41 per month, down \nfrom 64% in 2003 and 83% in 1999.8 \n \n5.  Increasing tax revenue during 2005\u20132008 enabled the government to increase social \nexpenditures. However, the global financial crisis resulted in a stall in GDP growth and a \ndecrease in tax revenues. To help maintain critical social expenditures, ADB provided a $40 \nmillion grant to Tajikistan in 2009,9 and other development partners provided grants for the \nsame purpose in 2009 and 2010. \n \nTable 1: Tajikistan Statistics \n Item  2005  2006  2007  2008  2009  2010  2011a  2012a  2013a \nNominal GDP (TJS million)  7,201  9,272  12,780  17,609  20,623  24,705  30,180  36,650  44,790 \n  Annual real GDP growth (%)  6.7  7.0  7.8  7.9  3.4  6.5  \u2026  \u2026  \u2026 \nTax revenues (TJS million)  1,439  1,533  2,274  3,289  3,635  4,447  5,496  6,900  8,491 \n   as % of GDP  16.6  16.5  17.8  18.7  17.6  18.0  18.2  18.8  19.0 \nTotal gov\u2019t expenditures   1,713  2,127  3,661  4,937  5,898  6,652  8,594  9,536  10,624 \n(TJS million)  \nTotal social expenditures   605  751  958  1,284  1,847  2,351  3,311  3,787  4,627 \n(TJS million)  \n   as % of GDP  8.4  8.1  7.5  7.3  9.0  9.5  11.0  10.3  10.3 \n   as % of total expenditures  35.3  35.3  26.2  26.0  31.3  35.3  38.5  39.7  43.5 \nPension expenditures  172  267  287  564  603  698  809  1,009  1,276 \n(TJS million) \nTotal number of pensioners  520,443  525,816  529,161  537,699  553,985  567,835  584,870  605,340  629,555 \nAvg. monthly pension   27.5  42.3  45.2  87.4  90.7  102.5  115.2  138.9  168.9 \n(year end, TJS) \nPoverty rate (%)  64.0  \u2026  53.5  \u2026  49.3  \u2026  44.8  41.4  \u2026 \n\u2026 = not available, GDP = gross domestic product. \na  Forecast. \nSources: State Statistics Committee of the Republic of Tajikistan.

The government has been facing fiscal pressures based on the need to increase social \nspending and to finance much-needed public investment. This translates into significant state \nbudget  deficits,  as  revenues  have  not  kept  pace  with  increased  expenditures,  and  revenue \nrecovery will take time. \n  \n7.  The  country\u2019s  borrowing  capacity  is  low,  which  limits  the  capacity  to  finance  social \npolicies.10 While  economic  recovery  is  under  way  in  Tajikistan,  fiscal  support  is  needed  to            \n(i) continue to increase critical social expenditures from their current low levels, (ii) face the impact \nof the demographic challenges on the pension system,11 (iii) prevent the risk that a full-scale exit \n                                                \n8  Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n9  ADB. 2009.

Tajikistan: First and Second Review Under the Three-Year Arrangement \nUnder the Extended Credit Facility. Washington, DC. \n11 During 1997\u20132009 the number of public pensioners increased by only 1.0% (about 6,000 pensioners in total). \nHowever, in 2010\u20132013, the number of pensioners will increase by 3.3% per year, from 553,000 to 630,000, an \neffect of the post-World War II \u2015baby boom\u2016. \n ", "3 \nof the fiscal stimulus may jeopardize its positive impact, and (iv) avoid a higher fiscal deficit that \ncould further weaken debt sustainability. \n \n8.  The  overall  fiscal  balance  in  2009,  excluding  the  public  investment  program,  was \nmaintained at a close to expected deficit of 0.6% of GDP, despite lower than expected growth. \nFor 2010, the government estimates a 1.0% deficit, due to less than expected revenues, which \nrequired additional cuts in nonessential expenditures until the end of the year. In 2011, the \ngovernment is planning a deficit not higher than 1.0% of GDP (Table 2). Public debt (including \npublic guaranteed debt) remains high at 36.4%. Net international reserves are estimated at \n$447.0 million, providing import cover for only about 1.6 months. 12 The current account deficit in \n2010 is estimated at 3.5% of GDP, a decrease from 4.9% in 2009, but it is expected to increase \nto 4.5% of GDP in 2011 and 5.5% of GDP in 2012. \n \n9.  For many years, the government has not fully prioritized the sectors being covered by \nthe program, but is now strongly committed to making improvements in these areas. The \nsupport and inducement of a program grant will support the government in implementing long-\nneeded reforms and will provide resources needed to ensure that critical social expenditures are \nincluded in the 2011 and 2012 budgets (Table 2). \n \nTable 2: Tajikistan State Budget and Financing Gap for 2011 \nItem  Amount ($ million)  % of GDP \n1.

The program is consistent with Tajikistan\u2019s national development strategy for 2006\u2013\n2015,13 which has the improvement of public administration as one of its three main goals. It is \nalso consistent with Tajikistan\u2019s  poverty reduction strategy for 2010\u20132012,14 which aims to \nbroaden  access  to  basic  social  services.

Impact and Outcome \n \n11.  The  program\u2019s  expected  impact  is  increased public  funding for  social  policies.  The \nexpected outcome is strengthened public resource management in Tajikistan. See the design \nand monitoring framework (Appendix 1) and the sector assessment summary (footnote 10). \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n12.  The program has three outputs: (i) selected aspects of tax policy and administration will be \nimproved; (ii) the Ministry of Labor and Social Protection will design, implement, and evaluate \nsocial safety net pilots; and (iii) selected aspects of public financial management will be improved. \n \n1.  Output 1: Selected Aspects of Tax Policy and Administration Improved \n \n13.  The government is committed to modernizing tax policy and administration. The program \nsupports  implementation  of  the  Tax  Administration  Development  Program  for  2011\u20132015, \napproved by the government in 2010. The Tax Administration Development Program sets out \nobjectives, targets, and indicative costs of reforms for (i) functional reorganization of the Tax \nCommittee  and  its  offices,  (ii)  introducing  performance  management,  (iii)  building  human \nresources capacity, and (iv) introducing information and communication technology in the tax \nsystem. Under the first tranche, the government has carried out Tax Code amendments which \n(i) eliminate selected value-added tax exemptions (including on medical services provided by \nthe private sector, sales of handicrafts, and air navigation services) and profit tax exemptions on \nthe dividends payable to local enterprises from other local enterprises, (ii) rationalize the rates of \nproperty tax by removing a broad range of rates and establishing single rates for various \ncategories of property (commercial, residential, and others), (iii) authorize the Tax Committee to \ndevelop procedures for electronic submission of tax returns to facilitate taxpayer compliance \nwith filing requirements and move to a risk-based audit system, and (iv) permit installment \npayments by taxpayers with arrears based on credible financing plans agreed upon between the \nTax  Committee  and  such  taxpayers.  The  Tax  Committee  has  increased  the  number  of \ntaxpayers to be handled by the Large Taxpayers Inspectorate (LTI) by 20% from the baseline of \nDecember 2010 (from 202 taxpayers to 245), with another increase of 20% planned for 2012 as \npart of the agreed reforms under the second tranche.  \n \n14.  By August 2012, normative acts will be issued by (i) the Tax Committee to implement the \nTax Code amendments; and (ii) the local governments of at least Dushanbe, Isfara, Khudjand, \nKulyab and Kurgantyube (the five largest cities by population) to implement amendments to the \nTax Code related to property tax. The Tax Committee will set up a technical working group to \nprovide  operational  advice  on  tax  reforms.  The  program  includes  TA  to  support  the  Tax \nCommittee in implementing agreed reform actions for the second tranche, including  \n(i)  modernizing the LTI by developing an information technology strategic plan with \ndetailed costing, developing detailed procedures and software, and initiating a \npilot for electronic submission of tax returns by large taxpayers;  \n                                                \n16 ADB. 2010.

The program will assist the government to transform the LTI into a model organization \nthat can efficiently handle an increasing number of large taxpayers and collect a much larger \nshare  of  taxes  in  Tajikistan.  Consultative  processes  with  key  stakeholders,  including \nprofessional women and representatives of the business community, will be established to \ndevelop and fine tune tax system simplification and reform proposals.18 \n \n2.  Output 2: Social Safety Net Pilots Designed, Implemented, and Evaluated \nby the Ministry of Labor and Social Protection  \n \n16.  The program will support reforms aimed at improving the effectiveness, efficiency, and \naccountability of public expenditures in social protection, in particular two new pilot programs that \nthe Ministry of Labor and Social Protection (MOLSP) has designed and started implementing. The \nphased implementation of the pilot for noncash-based transactions for pension payments through \nindividual bank accounts has been started in four districts of Dushanbe (Firdawsi, Shomansur, \nSino, and Somoni), and the cities of Kulyab and Kurgantyube. The MOLSP will conduct an \nindependent evaluation of the pilot to (i) determine the improvements in efficiency and quality of \nservice provided to pensioners (including a gender analysis which assesses the impact on men \nand women), (ii) determine the number of ghost pensioners identified and the resulting cost \nsavings,  and  (iii)  identify  gaps  and  develop  recommendations  for  improvement.  Requiring \npensioners to use plastic cards is expected to make payment of pensions more efficient and \nreduce  the  average  time  between  release  of  funds  and  the  availability  of  pensions  to \nbeneficiaries from to seven days from thirty under the paper-based system. It is also expected \nto help reduce the number of ghost pensioners and other system leakages (e.g., informal \npayments to bank tellers). A second pilot will redesign and improve targeting of social assistance \nand consolidation of social benefits (subsidies for gas, electricity and child school education) to \napproximately 10,000 households in the Yavan district and the town of Istaravshan. The MOLSP \nwill also conduct an independent evaluation of the second pilot program, including a gender \nanalysis. Improved targeting of social assistance is expected to help ensure that the benefits are \ngiven  to  those  that  need  it  most. This  will  help  improve  the  social safety  net systems  in \n                                                \n18 Development Coordination (accessible from list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "6 \nTajikistan. The MOLSP will take final decisions on the recommendations of both assessments \nand will publish the final assessment reports on its website.  \n \n3.  Output 3: Selected Aspects of Public Financial Management Improved \n \n17.  The program will support increased transparency and efficiency in public expenditures \nthrough the implementation of a new Law on Internal Audit in the Public Sector, enacted in 2010. \nThis law requires internal audit units to be established in government bodies that have annual \nfunding from the state budget exceeding a threshold amount. The program will also support the \nenactment and implementation of a new Law on Public Finances to unify the Medium-Term \nExpenditure Framework with the annual budgeting process. \n \nD.  Program Costs and Financing \n \n18.  The government has requested a grant of $45 million from the Asian Development Fund \n(ADF).19 The grant size is based on the estimated cost of reforms, the social expenditure needs \nof the government, and the availability of ADF resources for Tajikistan. The government has \ncommitted to spend approximately $41 million of the $45 million grant on social safety net \nexpenditures (Table 3 and the use of program proceeds).20 \n \n19.  The grant will be released in two tranches: the $20 million first tranche will be released upon \ngrant effectiveness; the $25 million second tranche is expected to be released in August 2012, \nsubject  to  compliance  with  the  agreed-upon  conditions.  The  program  design  will  provide  an \nincentive tranche, through which $12 million of the second tranche may be disbursed early if certain \nsecond tranche conditions are complied with by the end of 2011. The incentive tranche is designed \nto (i) keep the reform program on track and reward efficient implementation by the government,          \n(ii) allow the government to receive part of the funds by the end of 2011 for use in 2012, and         \n(iii) facilitate regular review and effective monitoring of the pace and direction of reforms. \n \nTable 3: Indicative Use of Program Proceedsa \n(TJS million) \nExpenditure Item  2011b  2012\u20132013b  Total \nSocial safety nets  94.0  109.5  203.5 \nSupport for the cost of reforms  2.0  18.0  20.0 \nTotal  96.0  127.5  223.5  \nin $ millionc  20.0  25.0  45.0 \na The  program  proceeds  will  be  used  to  fund  an  estimated  TJS223.5  million  ($45  million \nequivalent) of the expenditures indicated in the table.

Procurement and withdrawal procedures. Grant proceeds will be used to pay for \nitems procured in ADB member countries, other than the items specified in the list of ineligible \nitems21 and imports financed by other bilateral and multilateral sources. The proceeds of the \nprogram  grant  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s  simplified \ndisbursement  procedures  and  related  requirements  for  program  grants.22 Grant  proceeds \n \ndisbursed against imports will require a certificate from the government stipulating that the value \nof the total imports of Tajikistan, minus its imports from nonmember countries, ineligible imports, \nand imports financed under other official development assistance, is equal to or greater than the \namount of the grant expected to be disbursed during a particular year.  \n \n22.  The government will establish a subaccount in the Treasury Single Account (referred to \nas the special account) with the National Bank of Tajikistan (NBT). The grant proceeds will be \ncredited into a foreign currency (dollar) account established in the NBT. Counterpart funds will \nbe generated by converting the grant proceeds to somoni using the official exchange rate, and \nsuch counterpart funds will be credited into the special account. The crediting of the special \naccount will be done within 5 days of the disbursement of each tranche of the grant. The NBT \nwill provide ADB with official notification that the counterpart funds generated from the grant \nproceeds have been credited to the special account (including the amount of foreign currency \nconverted, the date of conversion to somoni, the official exchange rate, the date of deposit, the \nname and number of the special account, and the deposited somoni amount).

The  monthly  special  account  statement  (including  NBT  notification  and  MOF \ncertification) will be provided to ADB within 15 days of the end of each month. The use of \nspecial account funds and the expenditures funded by the counterpart funds will be audited by \nindependent auditors acceptable to ADB to confirm that these have been used for the intended \npurposes.

A TA grant of $1.125 million will be provided to support program reforms, and assist in \nsetting  up  information  systems  in  the  Tax  Committee  and  in  monitoring  the  program.  Six \nhundred thousand dollars will be funded by the Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-IV). \nCofinancing of $500,000 will be provided by the Republic of Korea e-Asia and Knowledge \nPartnership Fund and utilized primarily for information and communication technology support to \nthe Tax Committee.23 The monitoring arrangements built into the TA grant design will assist in \nensuring that use of proceeds on social protection programs remains on track. The government \nwill finance the remaining $25,000 equivalent of the TA cost.24  \n \nIV.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Governance \n \n24.  Tajikistan compares poorly with other countries of the region on accountability, control of \ncorruption,  government  effectiveness,  and  regulatory  quality.  The  Public  Expenditure  and \nFinancial Accountability assessment completed in May 200725 highlights a number of risks, \nparticularly in predictability and control in budget execution, accounting, recording and reporting, \nand external audit.26 While many of these weaknesses persist, the government continues to \nundertake  governance  and  public  financial  management  reforms  with  development  partner \nassistance.27 In recent years, important reforms have been put in place to (i) streamline the \npermits  and  inspection  regimes,  which  is  expected  to  improve  the  business  climate; \n(ii) restructure the government administration and reform pay and incentives in order to promote \na  more  professional  civil  service;  (iii)  strengthen  public  financial  management,  including \nenactment of new laws on public procurement and internal audit, as well as reform of the tax \nadministration and improvements in the budget process, all of which are expected to increase \npublic accountability and transparency; and (iv) improve public service delivery. Most of these \nreforms  are  being  supported  by  development  partners,  including  ADB  (footnote  18).  The \n                                                \n23 The funding from the Republic of Korea e-Asia and Knowledge Partnership Fund will be administered by ADB. \n24 Technical Assistance (accessible from list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n25 World Bank. 2007. Tajikistan: Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability Assessment. Washington, DC. \n26 The Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability assessment gave Tajikistan 2 As, 4 Bs, 11 Cs, and 13 Ds, \nwith 'A' reflecting high quality and 'D' reflecting need for further improvement. One indicator was not ranked. \n27 A risk-based assessment of public financial management (PFM) conducted by ADB in early 2010 found that the \nPFM environment in Tajikistan was extremely weak and there was little evidence of significant improvements in the \nperformance of systems and institutions since the publication of the 2007 Public Expenditure and Financial \nAccountability assessment. \n ", "9 \nprogram design features fiduciary safeguards to mitigate the risks arising from the weaknesses \nin governance and public financial management systems in the country (Table 5, and risk \nassessment and risk management plan).28 \n \n25.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government. \n \nB.  Poverty and Social \n \n26.  Over  the  short  term,  the  program  is  designed  to  help  ensure  that  critical  social \nexpenditures are maintained. If such expenditures are not made, poverty incidence will be \nhigher. Over the medium to long term, improving tax policy and tax administration should \nincrease government revenues. The government is committed to using a substantial portion of \nincremental tax revenues received to increase social expenditures, which is expected to have a \npositive impact on poverty reduction. The program also supports improved targeting of social \nexpenditures,  which  will  contribute  to  poverty  reduction  because  a  larger  portion  of  such \nexpenditures will be received by the poorest segments of the population. \n \n27.  Tajikistan\u2019s social situation exhibits certain gender inequalities, which are reflected in the \ndelivery of social services by the social protection system. For example, (i) female pensioners \nare poorer than male pensioners and depend more on state pensions (women can accumulate \nless pension insurance as only 14% of women are in formal employment and women receive \nless than half of men\u2019s wages on average),29 (ii) households headed by women depend more on \nsocial benefits (11% of household income comes from social benefits, compared to 4% in \nhouseholds headed by men),30 and (iii) women pensioners make up a majority of pensioners \n(56.3% in 2005).31 Women are often not aware of their rights under the social protection system. \nWomen in Tajikistan mostly live in households headed by men and thus receive social benefits \nthrough  the  registered  household  head.  This  dependence  on  the  male  household  head \nbecomes  a  constraint  when  male  migrant  workers  leave  behind  their  wives,  sisters,  and \nmothers, who then receive social benefits only through the registered name of their male \nrelatives. Moreover, it is difficult to monitor and evaluate the gender impacts of the social \nbenefits system as sex-disaggregated indicators do not exist. \n \n28.  The program will seek to address some of these challenges. First, the Tax Committee \nwill approve a policy to train all women professional and support staff in the LTI. This should \nimprove their chance for career progression in an agency which has very few women at senior \nlevels.  Second,  at  least  20% of the  members of  the  Business  Consultative Group  will  be \nwomen. Third, the gender impact of the two pilot social service delivery projects supported by \nthe program will be analyzed, and recommendations will be made to ensure that gender issues \nare taken into account during project expansion. \n \n \n                                                \n28 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan, Use of Program Proceeds, and Flow of Funds Under the Program \nGrant (accessible from list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n29 United Nations Development Fund for Women. 2007.
