The TRTA  facility  will  build  on  and  expand  the  scope  of  TA  8569-REG,  an \nearlier technical assistance (TA) that enhanced safeguards policy application in selected South \nAsia  region  developing  member  countries  (DMC). 1 Notwithstanding  the  achievements  of  TA \n8569-REG, the expansion of Asian Development Bank (ADB) operations in the region indicates \nthat it is  imperative to maintain TA support. This is particularly relevant for infrastructure projects \nthat typically involve significant environment and social risks such as urban transport and services, \nand  renewable  energy.  This  proposed  TRTA  facility  will  strengthen  the  capacity  of  key \ngovernment units, civil society, academe, consultants, and contractors to design, implement, and \nmonitor robust measures that address project risks to people and the environment.  \n \nAlignment  with  Strategy  2030. 2  To  operationalize  the  priority  of  Strategy  2030  on \n2. \nstrengthening  governance  and  institutional  capacity,  the  TRTA  facility  will  uphold  environment \nand social standards through more effective safeguards implementation and management.  While \nthe focus on ADB-supported operations, the intervention is relevant and applicable to all projects \nregardless of financing.  \n \n3. \nThe  policy  frameworks  that  govern  safeguards,  including  the  ADB  Safeguard  Policy \nStatement (SPS),3 seek to avoid, minimize, or mitigate adverse environment and social impacts \nof  investment  projects.  In  particular,  the  safeguard  policies  of  DMCs  and  multilateral  finance \ninstitutions  promote  the  mitigation  of  vulnerability,  a  major  risk  to  social  and  environment \nsustainability of projects, as well as protecting the rights of persons likely to be affected by the \nprojects. Implementation of safeguard measures has thus necessarily become embedded in the \nprocess of project preparation and implementation as it enhances project sustainability.  \n \n4. \nThe  TRTA  facility  seeks  to  maintain  ADB\u2019s  role  as  a  trusted  development  partner, \ndelivering  quality  operations  while  adding  practical  value  to  projects  that  fit  local  conditions, \nidentifying  lessons  learned,  and  replicating  good  practices  in  environment  and  social  risk \nmanagement.  It  will  support  environment  and  social  safeguards  due  diligence,  consultation, \nsupervision,  monitoring,  and  grievance  redress  in  ADB-funded  projects  in  all  the  South  Asian \ncountries and sectors within these countries. This will be essential for the smooth preparation and \nimplementation of the ADB\u2019s 2020-2022 programs in South Asia DMCs. The programs include \nsome 140 proposed projects involving a total of $22 billion in ADB funding.4 Of these projects, \nabout 24% may have significant adverse environment and/or involuntary resettlement impacts, \naround  66%  may  have  less  significant  adverse  impacts,  and  only  approximately  10%  are \nexpected to have no impacts. Projects with significant adverse and less adverse impacts require \nthorough \nthe  safeguard  plans  and  strong \nimplementation support. \n \n\ntimely  preparation  of \n\nimpact  assessment, \n\nCountries.

This TRTA facility is not listed in the current \nCountry Operations Business Plans (COBPs) of South Asia DMCs but will support projects listed \nin the respective COBPs (Appendix 1).5 Further, it will complement other TA projects in supporting \nimproved  project  implementation  and  will  not  duplicate  ongoing  assistance  which  addresses \nportfolio management in general. \n \nB. \n \n6. \nOutput 1: Environment and social risk management capacity improved. The TRTA \nfacility will support environment and social safeguards capacity building of government agencies \nin  the  region.  It  will  continue  to  improve  safeguard  results  by  providing  hands-on  support  to \nexecuting  and  implementing  agencies  (EAs/IAs)  upon  request  or  assessment  by  ADB  project \nteams.  This  will  include  providing  assistance  to  civil  society,  academe,  contractors,  and \nconsultants on the timely submission and improved quality of impact assessments and mitigation \nplans.  The  support  would  cover  as  necessary  the  entire  project  cycle,  from  the  preparation  of \ndetailed project reports, due diligence reports, impact assessment and mitigation plans, internal \nand external monitoring reports, and assessments of safeguard results at project completion. The \nTRTA  facility  will  support  workshops  and  related  training  programs  on  environment  and  social \nsafeguards.6 The training programs would be identified based on the assessment of capacity of \nproject implementation agencies. In addition, consultants will be engaged to review and provide \nanalysis of issues and proposed measures for safeguards strengthening. \n \nAt least ten training programs will be conducted for staff of EAs/IAs, civil society, academe, \n7. \ncontractors, and consultants on environment and social impact assessment, management plan, \nand  monitoring  reports  in  line  with  national,  agency,  and  sectoral  policies  and  ADB  SPS. 7 \nIndividual consultants will be engaged to conduct at least four studies on international safeguard \nbest practices and standards. Individual consultants will undertake activities in close interaction \nwith EAs/IAs, ADB, and other stakeholders.  \n \n8. \nOutput  2:  Project  management  and  supervision  capacity  of  executing  agencies \nstrengthened using advanced technology applications. Cost reduction is a measure for more \neffective and efficient safeguards implementation. One of the ways is using advanced technology \nto improve efficiency in data collection. Advanced technology includes remote sensing, satellite \nimaging,  use  of  drones,  global  positioning  and  other  hand-held  devices,  and  web-based \napplications.  The  TRTA  facility  will  maintain  and  enhance  South  Asia  Department\u2019s  (SARD) \nenvironment  and  social  safeguard  tracking  systems  and  develop  new  platforms  for  impact \nassessment,  monitoring,  and  grievance  redress.  Based  on  consultations  between  ADB  and \nrelevant agencies in each country, the TRTA facility will identify one or two projects in selected \nDMCs to be the focus of advanced technology application. Individual consultants on advanced \ntechnology will be engaged to assist in the use of new technology. The application of advanced \n\n \n\n5   ADB. 2019.

The  feasibility  of  the  use  of  advanced  technology \napplication will be assessed by ADB safeguards staff in consultation with TRTA facility consultants \nand EAs/IAs.  \n \n9. \nAt  least  two  workshops  and  related  training  programs  will  identify  and  focus  on  critical \nneeds and problems that can be addressed by advanced technology. Good practices and lessons \nwill  be  documented,  shared,  and  replicated.  Visits  to  institutions  in  regional  countries  where \nadvanced technology is effectively implemented, and partnerships can be developed will also be \nconsidered. \n \nOutput 3: Guidance material and knowledge products enhanced. The TRTA facility \n10. \nteam will select suitable projects programmed for ADB processing during the period 2020-2022 \nand use them to apply the knowledge acquired in related capacity building initiatives with a view \nof highlighting best practices in safeguards implementation.  \n \n11. \nIndividual  consultants  will  be  engaged  to  conduct  at  least  four  studies  on  international \nsafeguard  best  practices  and  standards,  and  prepare  guidance  notes  and  manuals  on \nenvironment and social safeguards.  \n \nC. \n \n12. \nThe TRTA facility is estimated to cost $3.0 million which will be financed on a grant basis \nby ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF 6).
