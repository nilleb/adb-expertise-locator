This  report  and \nrecommendation  covers  the  project  interventions  and  proposed  financing  for  Cambodia.  The \nreport  and  recommendation  covering  project  interventions  and  financing  for  the  Lao  PDR  and \nViet Nam was approved by the Board on 6 November 2012. The two-step processing approach \ndoes  not  compromise  the  overall  integrity  of  the  regional  project  in  general  and  the  regional \nactivities in particular. \n \nThe  project  will  support  the  Government  of  Cambodia  as  it  undertakes  structural  and \n3. \nnonstructural measures to prepare for and manage disaster risks linked to floods and droughts.3 \nProject interventions will (i) enhance the regional data, information, and knowledge base for the \nmanagement of floods and droughts; (ii) upgrade or develop water management infrastructure; \nand  (iii)  prepare  communities  to  manage  disasters  such  as  floods  and  droughts,  and  adapt  to \nclimate change. Improved drought management and irrigation water structures in Cambodia will \nbenefit farmers on about 16,000 hectares (ha) of agricultural lands, and at least 10,000 people \nwill benefit from improved flood management. 4 \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale5 \n\n \nA. \n \nThe  Mekong  River  stretches  from  the  eastern  watershed  of  the  Xizang6 Plateau  to  the \n4. \nMekong Delta, flowing over 4,909 kilometers (km) through Cambodia, the People\u2019s Republic of \nChina,  the  Lao  PDR,  Myanmar,  Thailand,  and  Viet  Nam  with  a  total  basin  area  of \n795,000 square kilometers (km2).7 The Lower Mekong Basin (LMB) is home to about 60 million \npeople in Cambodia, the Lao PDR, Thailand, and Viet Nam. The Mekong River, while being one \nof the 20 largest rivers in the world, stands apart because of the large fluctuations in seasonal \ndischarge\u2014very  low  flows  in  the  dry  season  yet  extensive  flooding  in  the  wet  season.8 River \n\n                                                 \n1   Under the Pilot Program for Climate Resilience financed by the Strategic Climate Fund. \n2   The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n3  \u201cStructural  measures  refer  to  any  physical  construction  to  reduce  or  avoid  possible  impacts  of  hazards,  which \ninclude  engineering  measures  and  construction  of  hazard-resistant  and  protective  structures  and  infrastructure. \nNonstructural  measures  refer  to  policies,  awareness,  knowledge  development,  public  commitment,  and  methods \nand operating practices, including participatory mechanisms and the provision of information, which can reduce risk \nand  related  impacts.\u201d  Source:  United  Nations  International  Strategy  for  Disaster  Reduction  (UNISDR).  2009. \nUNISDR  Terminology  on  Disaster  Risk  Reduction.

The  anticipated  impacts  of  climate  change  and  sea  level  rise  in  the \nMekong River Basin indicate that the water-related vulnerability will be exacerbated.9 Global and \nregional  climate  change  scenario  analyses  indicate  that  in  the  LMB,  temperatures  as  well  as \nannual  rainfall  and  runoff  will  increase  and  sea  level  will  rise,  increasing  agriculture  and \neconomic  losses  in  the  Mekong  Delta.10 Floods  and  droughts  are  projected  to  become  more \nfrequent and intense. \n \n6. \nFloods. Annual floods in the LMB are beneficial, nourishing the wetlands and sustaining \nfisheries and biodiversity.11 Extreme floods, however, cause losses and damage to livelihoods, \nagriculture,  and  infrastructure.  The  average  annual  direct  cost  of  flooding  to  agriculture, \ninfrastructure,  and  buildings  in  the  LMB  is  $60  million\u2013$70  million,  while  the  average  annual \nvalue of flood benefit is estimated at $8 billion\u2013$10 billion (footnote 10). The challenge for flood \nrisk management is to reduce the costs and impacts of flooding while preserving its benefits. \n \nPhysical exposure to flood risks in the LMB is high and this is translated into economic \n7. \nexposure.12 Damage  in  monetary  terms  is  higher  in  Viet  Nam,  signifying  the  level  of  exposure \nresulting from higher development (agriculture and infrastructure) than in Cambodia and the Lao \nPDR.  In  September  2009,  typhoon  Ketsana  caused  damage  and  losses  estimated  at  $800 \nmillion in Viet Nam, $131 million in Cambodia, and $58 million in the Lao PDR.  \n \n8. \nDroughts. Droughts, which occur as a result of periods of very low rainfall and river flow, \ncause disruption to the livelihoods of farmers and food supply chains.13 Droughts are considered \ndisasters  because  they  significantly  affect  poor  and  vulnerable  communities,  particularly  by \nincreasing  household  food  insecurity. 14  Water  shortages,  particularly  during  critical  growth \nstages  of  crops,  significantly  reduce  yields.  Saline  water  intrusion  in  estuaries  and  coastal \nareas\u2014exacerbated  by  the  low  flows,  particularly  in  the  delta  area  of  Viet  Nam\u2014is  another \ncause of concern that reduces food production. \n \n9. \nThe  direct  costs  of  drought  in  the  LMB  relate  to  the  impact  of  agricultural  droughts\u2014\nreduced yields or total loss of crops, especially rice, together with reduced livestock and fishery \nyields.  The  2004\u20132005  drought  was  severe  for  all  LMB  countries,  with  losses  estimated  at  \n$42  million  in  the  delta  and  localized  food  shortages.  The  extreme  low  flows  in  the  Mekong \nRiver during March\u2013April 2010 harmed dry season crops along the Mekong River as pumping \nstations were not able to draw water.   \n\n                                                 \n9  United Nations Environment Programme. 2009.

Bangkok. \n\n13 Meteorological  droughts,  defined  by  low  rainfall  over  the  wet  season  (May\u2013November),  reduce  yields  of  rain-fed \nrice  and  other  crops.  The  agricultural  impacts  of  hydrological  droughts  are  most  severe  during  the  dry  season, \nwhen  below-normal  streamflows  reduce  irrigation  and  the  yield  of  dry  season  crops.  Hydrological  droughts  may \nalso occur during the wet season, for example, when below-normal streamflows reduce the volume and extent of \nflood waters stored in the Tonle Sap Lake in Cambodia and the yield of its fishery.  \n\n14 Indirect costs that are difficult to assess include costs of perpetuating structural poverty, such as stunted growth in \n\nearly childhood, resulting in lifelong loss of productivity.  \n\n \n\n\f     3 \n\n \n10. \nInsufficient  disaster  preparedness.  Countries  in  the  LMB  have  varying  levels  of \ncapacity  to  prepare  for  and  manage  flood-  and  drought-related  disasters.  Actions  are  mostly \nreactive,  rather  than  proactive,  and  are  uncoordinated.  Better  flood  and  drought  disaster \npreparedness requires (i) knowledge availability and sharing of potential changes to the spatial \nand  temporal  distribution  of  climate  and  hydrological  variables  over  the  basin  as  a  whole; \n(ii) capacity  for  timely  flood  and  drought  forecasting  and  dissemination  of  warnings  to \ncommunities  at  risk;  (iii)  engagement  of  at-risk  communities  in  the  identification,  analysis, \ntreatment,  monitoring,  and  evaluation  of  disaster  risks  to  reduce  their  vulnerabilities  and \nenhance their coping capacities; and (iv) improved condition of water control infrastructure. \n \n11. \nSolutions  and  opportunities.  Improving  the  disaster  preparedness  of  countries  and \ncommunities  to  manage  and  mitigate  the  potential  impacts  of  extreme  floods  and  droughts \nrequires structural and nonstructural initiatives. In terms of nonstructural measures, institutional \nand  technical  capacity  building  activities  can  strengthen  regional  information  and  knowledge \ngeneration  and  sharing  with  regard  to  water  resources  management  in  general  and  flood  and \ndrought management in particular. Community-based disaster risk management (CBDRM) can \nequip  communities,  especially  women,  to  access  information  on  disaster  risks  and  enhance \ntheir  preparedness.15 Two-way  channels  for  information  sharing  between  local  communities, \nriver  basin  management  systems,  national  early  warning  centers,  and  disaster  forecasting \ncenters are necessary. Structural measures include rehabilitation of flood control embankments, \nwater control structures, and irrigation and drainage structures. \n \n12. \nRegional  initiatives.  The  project  is  one  of  the  flagship  programs  of  the  2002  GMS \nEconomic Cooperation Program Strategic Framework and the 2008 Vientiane Plan of Action. At \nthe  regional  level,  the  Mekong  River  Commission  provides  a  framework  for  sustainable \ndevelopment of the LMB.16 The Mekong River Commission secretariat plays an important role in \nsupporting  national  agencies  and  nongovernment  organizations  with  technical  services  on \nregional and  transboundary issues. ADB and development partners are also supporting natural \nresource management  and climate change adaptation through subregional initiatives including \nthe GMS Core Environment Program and its Biodiversity Conservation Initiative, and the GMS \nCore Agriculture Support Program.17  \n \nRelevance  to  national  priorities.  The  project  is  aligned  with  the  relevant  policies, \n13. \nstrategies,  and  programs  such  as  (i)  the  Lao  PDR  Disaster  Management  Action  Frameworks, \n2003\u20132020;  (ii)  Viet  Nam\u2019s  National  Strategy  for  Natural  Disaster  Prevention,  Response  and \nMitigation approved by the Prime Minister in 2007 (Decision No. 172/2007); National Targeted \nProgram to Respond to Climate Change; Strategic Direction of Water Resources Development \n(to  2020  and  toward  2050),  and  the  Mekong  Delta  Master  Plan;  and  (iii) the  Ministry  of  Water \nResources  and  Meteorology  of  Cambodia\u2019s  Rectangular  Strategy  and  the  National  Water \nResources Policy for Cambodia.18 \n \n \n\n                                                 \n15 CBDRM  is  a  process  in  which  at-risk  communities  are  actively  engaged  in  the  identification,  analysis,  treatment, \nand monitoring and evaluation of disaster risks in order to reduce their vulnerabilities and enhance their capacities. \nCBDRM seeks to strengthen community resilience to disaster-related shocks. \n\n16 The  Mekong  River  Commission  was  formed  on  5  April  1995  by  an  agreement  between  the  governments  of \nCambodia,  the  Lao  PDR,  Thailand,  and  Viet  Nam.  The  Mekong  River  Commission  secretariat  is  based  in \nVientiane, Lao PDR. \n\n17 The  GMS  initiatives  are  supported  by  several  development  partners,  such  as  the  Government  of  Finland  (Core \nEnvironment  Program  Biodiversity  Corridors  Initiative  pilot  and  second  phases)  and  the  Government  of  Sweden \n(Implementing the Core Agriculture Support Program Phase 2). \n\n18 Approved by the Council of Ministers on 16 January 2004. \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nADB  support.  The  project  is  aligned  with  ADB\u2019s  Water  Operational  Plan,  2011\u20132020, \n14. \nwhich identifies flood and drought mitigation (as part of disaster risk management) as one of the \ntwo urgent challenges to be addressed in the integrated water resource management process.19 \nThe project is also aligned with the ADB\u2019s Disaster and Emergency Assistance Policy (2004) as \nit  will  support  the  governments  and  local  communities  in  identifying  and  managing  risks  from \nnatural  hazards.  The  project  benefits  from  lessons  from  past  ADB  assistance  on  irrigation \ndevelopment and flood management in the region.20 \n \nB. \n \n15. \nThe  impact  will  be  reduced  economic  losses  resulting  from  floods  and  droughts.  The \noutcome  will  be  improved  capacity  and  preparedness  to  manage  and  mitigate  the  impacts  of \nflood and drought events.21 \n \nC. \n \n16. \n \n17. \nOutput  1:  Enhanced  regional  data,  information,  and  knowledge  base  for  the \nmanagement  of  floods  and  droughts. The project will support (i) the development of design \ncriteria  for  flood  and  drought  risk  mitigation  schemes  and  water  control  infrastructure  in  the \nMekong Delta and elsewhere, (ii) the assessment of cross-border flood management options in \nViet Nam and Cambodia, and (iii) the strengthening of the National Flood Forecasting Center. \n \nOutput  2:  Upgraded  water  management  infrastructure.  The  Damnak  Chheukrom \n18. \nirrigation  system  rehabilitation  subproject  for  improved  drought  management  and  increased \nflood protection of Pursat town includes:22  \n\nThe project in Cambodia will have four key outputs. \n\nOutputs  \n\n(i)  \n\n(ii)  \n\n(iii)  \n\nan upstream controlled and supply-managed irrigation scheme to provide (a) wet \nseason  supplementary  irrigation  for  16,100  ha  of  net  command  area  in  Pursat \nProvince,  and  (b)  full  irrigation  to  a  smaller  net  command  area  during  the  dry \nseason;23  \na  new  headworks  structure  that  will  withdraw  irrigation  water  from  the  Pursat \nRiver to the command area and facilitate peak flood diversion using the scheme\u2019s \nmain  canal,  comprising  (a)  a  new  barrage  located  on  the  Pursat  River  about \n40 km  upstream  of  Pursat  town  that  is  designed  to  safely  convey  the  50-year \nflood  under  anticipated  climate  change  conditions,  and  (b)  an  intake  structure \nthat can control river withdrawals for both command and flood diversion flows;  \na  30  km  main  canal  that  will  convey  the  peak  flood  diversion  discharge  of  40 \ncubic meters per second from the Pursat River to the Svay Donkeo River, which \ncomprises (a) rehabilitation of a 14 km reach of an existing nonfunctioning main \ncanal, and (b) further construction of 16 km of new main canal;  \n\n                                                 \n19 ADB. 2011.

Community-\ndriven  flood  and  drought  risk  reduction  measures  will  be  implemented  based  on  participatory \nlocal  flood  and  drought  risk  assessment  and  analysis,  and  disaster  risk  reduction  and \nmanagement  plans. 24  Farmer  water  user  committees  will  receive  training  and  support  to \neffectively undertake their role as managers of the tertiary and distribution irrigation system; and \nthey will be supported in climate adaptation measures to diversify their crops and reduce crop \nirrigation requirements for dry and early wet season crops. \n \nOutput  4:  Effective  project  implementation.  The  project  will  provide  support  to  the \n20. \nexecuting agency and implementing agencies in the form of  improved office facilities, technical \nand  office  equipment,  capacity  development  of  the  staff,  and  consulting  services  for  detailed \ndesign and construction supervision and implementation support. \n \n21. \nIncreased  climate  resilience. The outputs are designed to increase climate resilience \nin  Cambodia  in  general  and  in  the  project  area  of  Pursat  Province  in  particular.25 As  climate \nchange predictions indicate larger peak water flows, the design structural subproject has been \nimproved  to  ensure  that  the  subproject  is  more  climate  resilient.  Besides  structural  measures, \nclimate  resilience  will  be  increased  through  accompanying  nonstructural  measures.  The  ADB \nSCF  grant  will  finance  the  costs  of  nonstructural  measures  to  strengthen  the  capacity  of  the \ngovernment and affected communities to reduce the risks associated with climate extremes, i.e., \nfloods  and  droughts.  The  key  measures  are  (i) setting  up  an  effective  early  flood  and  drought \nwarning  system  by  providing  real-time  data  through  improved  communication  among  the \nDepartment  of  Meteorology,  the  Provincial  Department  of  Water  Resources  and  Meteorology \n(PDWRAM),  the  Provincial  Committee  for  Disaster  Management,  and  the  farmer  water  user \ncommittees;  (ii) improving  hydraulic  design  standards  in  the  Mekong  Delta;  (iii) providing \ntechnical assistance to build community capacity to better manage and mitigate risks associated \nwith increasing climate extremes, including the use of early warning systems to augment coping \nstrategies  and  mechanisms  of  communities  and  promote  community-based  disaster  risk \nreduction and management; and (iv) promoting adaptation measures. \n \nD. \n \n22. \n \n \n\nThe project is estimated to cost $47.75 million (Table 1). \n\nInvestment and Financing Plans  \n\n \n\n                                                 \n24 The proposed support to the Lao PDR and Viet Nam includes similar CBDRM activities. \n25 Increased Climate Resilience (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\nItem \nA.
