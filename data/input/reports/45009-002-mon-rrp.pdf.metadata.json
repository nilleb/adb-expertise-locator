It \nwill (i) improve the safety of blood transfusions, (ii) strengthen medical waste management, and \ninfections. 2  It  complements  previous  Asian \n(iii)  prevent  and  control  hospital-acquired \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) initiatives in the health sector in Mongolia. \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nMongolia\u2019s economic outlook is bright, but the country is experiencing severe shortages \n3. \nin the provision of social services. The cost of reforming the hospital sector in Ulaanbaatar alone \nis  estimated  at  $450  million.3 At  the  same  time,  international  support  to  the  health  sector  is \nshrinking. Capacity is inadequate to implement reforms to improve the accessibility and service \nquality  of  hospital  services.  Poorer  segments  of  the  population  have  limited  access  to  private \nhospitals because of the high cost of care and limited health insurance coverage. The safety of \npatients  and  health  workers  is  compromised  by  lapses  in  hospital  hygiene,  blood  transfusion \npractices, and medical waste management in the public and private sectors. \n\nThe  government  seeks \n\nto  strengthen  blood  safety \n\n4. \nimprove \npreparedness  for  emergencies  in  case  of  natural  disasters.  Deficiencies  in  aimag  (province) \nblood  banks  impact  on  patients\u2019  and  health  workers\u2019  safety.  Inadequate  facilities,  equipment, \nand  testing  materials;  inadequate  capacity  of  personnel  involved  in  blood  safety;  lack  of \nconfidentiality;  poor  registration  and  reporting  of  adverse  reactions;  lack  of  readiness  for \nemergencies; and lack of measures to reduce inappropriate blood transfusions are among the \nmajor deficiencies, which can result in unintentional transmission of HIV, syphilis, and hepatitis \nB and C. \n\nin  hospitals  and \n\n5. \nEfforts are under way in Ulaanbaatar and in medium-sized cities such as Darkhan and \nErdenet  to  improve  hospital  medical  waste  treatment  and  disposal,  but  the  situation  in  the \naimags  is  far  from  ideal.  Management  of  liquid  hazardous  waste  produced  by  hospitals  and \nlaboratories  is  inadequate.  Liquid  hazardous  waste,  when  poorly  disposed  of,  causes  harm  to \npeople  and  the  environment,  as  it  contains  chemical  substances,  drugs,  and  pathogens. \nHospital sewerage systems are not always of good quality, resulting in environmental and public \nhealth risks.  \n\n6. \nInfection  control  in  Mongolian  health  care  facilities  is  poor  and  hospital-acquired \ninfections are thought to be underreported.4 In March 2010, Mongolia experienced 28 hospital-\nacquired  infections  among  newborns,  of  whom  five  died,  as  a  result  of  poor  infection  control \nclinical practices. The prevalence of hepatitis B and C among health care workers in Mongolia is \n\n                                                 \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  provided  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  ($700,000)  funded  by  the \nJapan  Fund  for  Poverty  Reduction.  ADB.  2011.  Technical  Assistance  to  Mongolia  for  Preparing  the  Fifth  Health \nSector Development Project. Manila. \n\n3  Communication from consultant team of ADB. 2009. Technical Assistance to Mongolia for the Fourth Health Sector \n\nDevelopment: Improving Sector Governance. Manila (TA 7309-MON). \n\n4  Mongolia  declared  85  cases  of  hospital-acquired  infections  in  2010  (Ministry  of  Health.  2011.  Health  Indicators. \nUlaanbaatar) against World Health Organization (WHO) estimates of 3.5%\u201310.0% of treated cases in hospitals in \nthe Asia and Pacific region; WHO estimates imply 21,000\u201370,000 expected cases of hospital-acquired infections in \nMongolia.  \n\n\fone  of  the  highest  in  the  world  and  points  to  breaches  in  health  care  safety. 5 Sterilization \nfacilities  and  practices  in  hospitals  are  poor,  and  basic  hygiene  measures,  such  as  hand \nwashing,  are  not  commonly  implemented.  The  surveillance  system  currently  implemented  in \nhospitals consists of passive reporting of hospital-acquired infections. Several aspects prevent \nthe  current  passive  surveillance  system  in  hospitals  from  being  effective:  (i)  the  disincentive \nassociated with reporting of hospital-acquired infection cases; (ii) the widespread preventive use \nof antibiotics for surgery and other procedures, including for newborn babies; and (iii) the lack of \nmicrobiology capacity to detect infections and sensitivity to treatment. \n\n7. \nThe government has established a legal and regulatory framework to address the above \nshortcomings. However, it lacks investment funding; financing of operational costs; and human \nresources  capacity  to  implement  regulatory  measures,  guidelines,  and  plans.  Several \ninternational  partners  are  supporting  the  government  in  these  areas  but  significant  gaps  exist, \nprimarily  investments,  development  of  monitoring  and  surveillance  systems,  and  institutional \nand human resources capacity development.6 Private investors are entering the hospital market, \nintending  to  offer  higher  standards  of  care  for  more  affluent  patients. 7 Public  hospitals  (with  a \ngreater bed capacity) lag behind and remain a serious threat to the safety of patients and health \nworkers. This perpetuates discrimination between poorer and more affluent population groups. \nA central facility for the treatment and disposal of medical wastes was established as a public\u2013\nprivate partnership in Ulaanbaatar in 2007 and has been operational since 2010. This initiative, \nalthough  requiring  major  investments,  is  a  solid  foundation  for  improved  medical  waste \nmanagement in the capital where almost half of the Mongolian population lives. Ulaanbaatar\u2019s \nNational Transfusiology Center (NTC), which provides blood transfusion services of acceptable \nquality,  can  play  an  important  role  in  capacity  development  and  monitoring  of  hospital \ntransfusion activities in Ulaanbaatar and in the aimags. \n\n8. \nThe  project  builds  on  hospital  sector  reforms  initiated  under  previous  ADB-funded \noperations in Mongolia. The Health Sector Development Program focused on hospital planning \nand  licensing;  the  Second  Health  Sector  Development  Project  supported  hospital  financing; \nhospital  efficiency  and  governance  is  supported  by  the  ongoing  Third  Health  Sector \nDevelopment  Project;  and  the  Fourth  Health  Sector  Development  Project,  including  additional \nfinancing is engaged in restructuring the hospital sector, especially in Ulaanbaatar, to rationalize \nhospital  capacity  and  services. 8  Hospital  rationalization  needs  to  be  complemented  with \n\n                                                 \n5  Various  publications  since  1998  report  a  wide  range  of  the  prevalence  of  hepatitis  B  and  C  carriers  in  various \npopulation  groups  in  Mongolia  (blood  donors,  health  care  workers,  general  population,  males,  and  outpatients). \nThe reported proportions vary from 8% to 29% for hepatitis B and from 2% to 48% for hepatitis C carriers. \n\n6  The  Global  Fund  to  Fight  AIDS,  Tuberculosis  and  Malaria;  the  Millennium  Challenge  Account;  and  the  WHO \nsupport  the  government  in  blood  safety,  medical  waste  management,  and  infection  prevention  and  control.  The \nADB-funded Third Health Sector Development Project (ADB. 2007. Report and Recommendation of the President \nto the Board of Directors: Proposed Grant to Mongolia for the Third Health Sector Development Project. Manila) is \nsupporting  the  government,  especially  in  medical  waste  management,  and  is  closely  coordinating  with  all  other \npartners in the sector to avoid duplications. \n\n7  Songdo  Hospital,  a  private  Republic  of  Korea  investment,  opened  in  2007  and  provides  secondary  and  partly \ntertiary  medical  care.  Since  early  2011,  Gurvan  Gal  Private  Hospital,  a  110-bed  hospital,  provides  quality  care \nbased exclusively on out-of-pocket expenses. MSC, a private Mongolian group operating in the mining and other \nsectors, will start operating a 100-bed hospital with international standards from early 2013. \n\n8  ADB.  1997.

Major lessons learned described in para. 12 of the sector assessment9 have \nbeen incorporated in the design of the project by continuing to support the hospital sector to see \nreform  come  to  fruition,  engaging  in  a  wide  consultation  process  on  hospital  restructuring, \nensuring  proper  baseline  data  collection  and  defining  meaningful  indicators,  and  providing \ncontinuous  capacity  building  of  the  executing  agency  on  ADB  policies.  The  project  will  deliver \ntangible benefits to women by ensuring higher safety standards to protect staff, the majority of \nwhom  are  women,  against  hospital-acquired  infections  and  improving  the  safety  of  blood \ntransfusions in hospitals. \n\n9. \nADB  is  the  largest  external  financier  of  the  health  sector  in  Mongolia,  and  plays  a  key \nrole in assisting the government to formulate and implement health sector reforms. Support from \nother  partners  focuses  on  assisting  the  government  to  address  particular  diseases  or  develop \ncertain  programs.  ADB  works  in  close  consultation  with  these  partners  to  support  the \ncoordinated  implementation  of  the  Health  Sector  Master  Plan,  2006\u20132015.  The  World  Health \nOrganization (WHO), with global expertise in all three focus areas of the project, will assist the \nproject mainly by providing consulting services. The German Federal Ministry of Health, which is \nsupporting  a  small-scale  hospital  hygiene  project  in  Mongolia,  will  support  the  project  by \nproviding  advisory  services  for  policy  development,  monitoring  and  evaluation,  and  training \nactivities in Mongolia and Germany. \n\n10. \nThe  project  builds  on  previous  ADB  health  sector  development  initiatives  and  policy \nreforms  under  the  Social  Sectors  Support  Program10 to  reform  the  Mongolian  health  sector  in \nline  with  (i)  the  National  Development  Strategy  in  achieving  Millennium  Development  Goals \n(MDGs)  4  (child  health)  and  5  (maternal  health),  and  more  directly  MDG  6  (HIV/AIDS  and \ntuberculosis) and MDG 7 (environmental health and sanitation); and (ii) the government\u2019s Health \nSector  Master  Plan,  2006\u20132015  for  improving  hospital  services.  The  project  is  included  in  the \ncountry  operations  business  plan,  2012\u2013201411 and  is  consistent  with  the  country  partnership \nstrategy,  2012\u20132016, 12  which  emphasizes  social  development  through  efficient  delivery  of \nhealth services. \n\nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nThe  impact  of  the  project  will  be  improved  quality  of  health  services  in  Mongolia.  The \n11. \noutcome  will  be  improved  patient  and  health  worker  safety  in  project-supported  hospitals  in \nMongolia.  The  project\u2019s  geographical  focus  will  include  secondary  and  tertiary  hospitals  in \nUlaanbaatar, aimags, and soum (administrative subdivision of the aimag) centers. \n\nC. \n\nOutputs \n\n12. \n\nThe project will have three components with the following outputs: \n\n                                                                                                                                                          \nBoard of Directors: Proposed Loan to Mongolia for Additional Financing of the Fourth Health Sector Development \nProject.

The  project  will  assist  in  establishing \nthe  new  NTC  in  Ulaanbaatar13 by  providing  equipment,  improving  management \nsystems,  implementing  capacity  building  measures,  and  seeking  international \naccreditation of the new NTC. A model maintenance unit will be developed in the \nNTC,  which  will  serve  as  a  basis  to  strengthen  maintenance  systems  and \ncapacities in hospitals covered by the project. The project will also improve blood \nsafety in aimag general hospitals and soum health centers, providing equipment, \ntraining  to  personnel  concerned,  and  organizing  blood  donor  management \nsystems, including public awareness-raising. \nComponent  2:  Medical  waste  management.  The  central  medical  waste \nmanagement  facility  in  Ulaanbaatar  will  be  upgraded  to  meet  internationally \naccepted standards by funding minor civil works, procuring equipment, improving \nmanagement  systems,  and  providing  capacity  building  for  personnel.  The \nmonitoring  and  inspection  capacity  of  the  Ministry  of  Health  (MOH)  and  the \nGeneral  Agency \nInspection  on  medical  waste  will  be \nstrengthened.  Medical  waste  management  systems,  including  liquid  hazardous \nwaste,  will  be  improved  to  meet  national  standards  in  hospitals  in  Darkhan, \nErdenet,  and  Ulaanbaatar,  and  aimag  general  hospitals  by  providing  basic \nequipment,  raising  awareness  and  training  personnel,  and  ensuring  recurrent \nfunding  for  medical  waste  is  sustained  via  proper  costing  and  inclusion  in  the \nMOH budget. \nComponent  3:  Hospital  hygiene  and  infection  prevention  and  control. \nMicrobiology  laboratories  in  hospitals  in  Erdenet,  Darkhan,  Ulaanbaatar,  and \naimag  general  hospitals  will  be  provided  with  equipment  to  ensure  effective \ninfection  prevention  and  control,  and  existing  policies  and  guidelines  will  be \nreviewed and upgraded. In hospitals, basic infrastructure and equipment will be \ndeveloped, maintenance capacity will be strengthened, and adequate funding of \nrecurrent  costs  for  infection  prevention  and  control  will  be  institutionalized.  An \neffective surveillance system for hospital-acquired infections will be developed by \nimproving  policies  and  guidelines,  assigning \nresponsibilities,  developing \nincentives  for  proper  reporting,  and  pilot  testing  the  system.  The  awareness, \nknowledge,  and  capacity  of  health  authorities,  health  care  workers,  and \nadministrative  staff  on  infection  prevention  and  control  will  be  strengthened. \nInfection  prevention  and  control  will  be \nin  hospital  quality \nmanagement  systems,  and  an  improved  inspection  module  for  infection \nprevention  and  control  will  be  used  by  the  General  Agency  for  Specialized \nInspection to promote infection prevention and control. \n\nincorporated \n\nD. \n\nInvestment and Financing Plans  \n\nThe  project \n\n13. \ncontingencies, and total taxes and duties of $0.65 million (Table 1). \n\nto  cost  $38.38  million, \n\nis  estimated \n\nincluding  physical  and  price \n\nTable 1: Project Investment Plan \n($ million) \n\nItem \nA.

The project includes taxes and duties of $0.65 million to be financed by the government and ADB. \nThe following principles were followed in determining the amount of taxes and duties to be financed by ADB: (i) it is \nconsistent with the current country partnership strategy, (ii) the amount does not represent an excessive share of \nthe  project  investment  plan,  (iii)  the  taxes  and  duties  apply  only  to  ADB-financed  expenditures,  and  (iv)  the \nfinancing of the taxes and duties is material and relevant to the success of the project. \n\n15 The  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  became  effective  on  4  November  2011  and  was  physically \ncompleted  on  30  September  2012.  A  consulting  firm  provided  17  person-months  of  international  consulting \nservices  and  30  person-months  of  national  consulting  services  with  expertise  in  blood  safety,  medical  waste \nmanagement,  infection  prevention  and  control,  finance  and  economics,  environmental  assessment,  and  poverty \nand social safeguards. \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\nE. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nThe implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 3 and described in detail in \n\n16. \nthe project administration manual (PAM).16 \n\nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \n\nArrangements \n\nJune 2013\u2013June 2018 \n30 June 2018 \n\nAspects \nImplementation period \nEstimated completion \ndate \nManagement \n\n(i) Oversight body \n\n(ii) Executing agency  The Ministry of Health will be the executing agency of the project and the \n\n(iii) Key implementing \n\nagencies \n\nThe role of the project steering committee of the Fourth Health Sector \nDevelopment Project will be expanded to cover the Fifth Health Sector \nDevelopment Project. It is chaired by the vice minister of health and composed \nof senior officials from the Ministry of Health; the Ministry of Finance; the \nMinistry of Social Welfare and Labour; the Ministry of Nature, Environment and \nTourism; the State Social Insurance General Office; the Ulaanbaatar City \nMayor\u2019s Office; the General Agency for Specialized Inspection; the Health \nSciences University of Mongolia; the Pharmaceutical Association; the Hospital \nAssociation; the Mongolian Consumer Association; and the Mongolian \nAssociation of Family Doctors. A representative of the NTC and a \nrepresentative of the National Center for Communicable Diseases will be added \nto the current list of members. \n\nimplementing agency for outputs 2 and 4. \nThe NTC will be the implementing agency for the establishment of the new \ntransfusiology center (output 1 of the DMF) and will be closely associated to the \nimplementation of project activities related to output 2. \nThe Ulaanbaatar City Mayor\u2019s Office will be the implementing agency for \nstrengthening the Ulaanbaatar waste management facility (output 3 of the \nDMF) and will be closely associated to the implementation of project activities \nrelated to the district hospitals of Ulaanbaatar City. \nThe National Center for Communicable Diseases will be the implementing \nagency for strengthening infection prevention and control (outputs 5, 6, 7, 8, \nand 9 of the DMF). \nOn behalf of the executing agency, the implementation unit will be responsible \nfor the day-to-day management of the project. The responsibility of the PIU of \nthe Fourth Health Sector Development Project will be expanded to include \nimplementation of the Fifth Health Sector Development Project. The contract \nperiod of the current PIU staff, except for the hospital services development \ncoordinator and the drug safety coordinator, will be extended to the end of the \nFifth Health Sector Development Project.

The  equipment  to  be  supplied  for  the  new  NTC \nand  aimag  blood  banks,  microbiology  laboratories,  and  sterilization  services  is  standard.  The \nproject  plans  to  procure  similar  equipment,  which  will  minimize  operation  and  maintenance \n(O&M)  risks.  Maintenance  services  included  in  the  supply  contracts,  and  strengthening  of \nmaintenance  services  planned  under  the  project,  will  enhance  local  capacities  for  O&M  of \nsupplied equipment. \n\nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n18. \nThe economic analysis evaluated the economic  viability of the project as a whole. The \neconomic  analysis  covers  the  macroeconomic  context  to  review  the  potential  for  the \ngovernment  to  continue  to  finance  project  activities  in  the  longer  term  following  project \ncompletion.  The  analysis  covers  the  quantifiable  economic  costs  and  benefits  of  the  three \ncomponents  and  provides  a  qualitative  analysis  of  the  improved  safe  blood  transfusion \ncomponent  and  the  medical  waste  management  component.  The  economic  impact  of  safe \nblood transfusion and medical waste management components includes a number of variables \nthat  cannot  appropriately  be  given  a  monetary  value  (e.g.,  years  of  life  saved  by  reducing \ntransfusion-transmitted  infections  and  improved  treatment  facilitated  by  greater  availability  of \nblood  for  transfusion).  The  economic  impact  of  the  medical  waste  management  component  is \npartially  quantified  (savings  on  energy  consumption).  Using  conservative  estimates  of  project \nimplementation, the baseline results show an economic internal rate of return (EIRR) of 17.51%. \nThe EIRR was tested through sensitivity analysis using a 20% decrease in economic benefits as \nthe  worst-case  scenario  for  all  economic  benefits.  Under  these  assumptions,  the  EIRR  is \n13.76%. The project is considered economically viable. \n\n19. \nThe project has no revenue-earning component, hence financial costs and benefits were \nnot  analyzed.  The  financial  sustainability  of  the  project  was  assessed  at  the  fiscal and  project \nlevels.  An  analysis  of  recent  and  projected  government  expenditures  was  undertaken  to \nevaluate the potential impact of the project on the budget of the MOH. The MOH will contribute \ncounterpart  funding  and  shoulder  the  project\u2019s  O&M  costs  during  implementation.  The \ngovernment\u2019s annual share of project costs will average about $1.5 million or less than 0.6% of \nthe health sector annual budget in 2011. The recurrent costs of the project, to be borne by the \nGovernment of Mongolia, are estimated to be about $0.4 million per annum and include O&M \nand  consumable  costs  of  the  project  facilities.  The  annual  recurrent  costs  to  be  borne  by  the \nexecuting  agency  will  not  exceed  0.15%  of  its  current  expenditure.  Considering  an  average \ndepreciation value of $2 million per annum for the equipment, the recurrent cost impact will be \n$2.4  million  per  annum,  which  represents  about  1%  of  the  total  recurrent  costs  of  2011.  The \ncounterpart funding and O&M costs are considered both financially sustainable and affordable. \nA loan covenant makes provision for adequate counterpart funding (Table 4). \n\n \n\n7\n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nC. \n\nGovernance \n\n20. \nThe MOH is a long-term partner of ADB, and has been actively involved in implementing \nhealth  sector  development  projects  since  1991.  A  project  implementation  unit  (PIU)  was \nestablished  as  part  of  the  ongoing  Third  and  Fourth  Health  Sector  Development  Projects  and \nthis  arrangement  will  be  expanded  to  incorporate  implementation  of  the  Fifth  Health  Sector \nDevelopment Project. \n\nA procurement capability assessment conducted for the executing agency and the PIU \n21. \nconfirmed  their  general  ability  to  conduct  procurement  in  compliance  with  ADB  policy  and \nprocedural requirements and the relevant national laws and regulations on public procurement. \nThe  implementing  agencies  have  no  or  limited  procurement  experience  using  ADB  policies \nand procedural requirements. Therefore, all procurement under the project will be carried out by \nthe executing agency and coordinated by the PIU. \n\n22. \nFinancial  management  assessments  have  been  conducted  for  the  MOH,  Ulaanbaatar \nCity  Mayor\u2019s  Office,  the  NTC,  and  the  National  Center  for  Communicable  Diseases.  The \nassessments for the MOH, the Ulaanbaatar City Mayor\u2019s Office, and the PIU, carried out as part \nof project preparation of the Fourth Health Sector Development Project in 2010, were updated, \nand assessments of the NTC and the National Center for Communicable Diseases were carried \nout  for  preparation  of  the  Fifth  Health  Sector  Development  Project.  All  four  agencies  have \nadequate  accounting  professionals  and  have  computerized  financial  accounting  and  reporting \nsystems. Procedures on the flow of accounting, financial, and project physical progress related \nto  their  current  project  activities  are  available.  All  the  agencies  have  clearly  defined \nresponsibilities, with accountability assigned to different units at different levels of authority. \n\n23. \nAnnual  audits  for  the  project  will  be  arranged  by  the  Ministry  of  Finance.  In  general, \nthe  financial  management  assessment  concluded  that  the  current  financial  management \nsystem in  the  executing and  implementing agencies meets  government  requirements in terms \nof  staffing,  accounting,  and  internal  control.  The  PIU  will  recruit  an  additional  technical \ncoordinator  to  strengthen  its  capacity  to  implement  the  project  in  compliance  with  the  policy, \noperation, and procedural requirements of ADB. \n\nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \n24. \nwith  the  Government  of  Mongolia,  the  MOH,  and  implementing  agencies.  The  specific  policy \nrequirements and supplementary measures are described in the PAM (footnote 16). \n\nD. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n25. \nThe  project  will  improve  patients\u2019  and  health  workers\u2019  safety  in  hospitals  in  Mongolia. \nImproving  the  safety  of  blood  transfusions  will  be  applied  nationwide  and  will  reach  a  large \nproportion  of  the  Mongolian  population.  The  components  on  improving  medical  waste \nmanagement  and  prevention  and  control  of  hospital-acquired  infection  will  reach  about \n1,850,000 beneficiaries. About 13,500 health workers will also benefit directly, especially those \nwith professions that put them at occupational risk because of insufficient and unsecure blood \nproducts  and  processes.  The  project  will  provide  gender  and  culturally  sensitive  information, \neducation,  and  communication  on  voluntary  blood  safety  for  the  public  to  help  address  the \ndeficit in blood donations and fears of infections from the procedures. \n\nGender benefits. The project is designed to be effective gender mainstreaming. Women \n26. \nmake  up  82%  of  the  health  care  workforce.  Women  are  commonly  responsible  for  blood \nprocessing,  infection  prevention  and  control,  waste  management  and  handling,  cleaning,  and \n\n \n\n\fdisinfection;  and  are  most  exposed  to  hospital-acquired  infections  and  transfusion-transmitted \ninfections. Women also constitute the majority (about 80%) of hospital patients. A  gender action \nplan  has  been  developed  for  the  project  to  ensure  that  gender  is  mainstreamed.  The  plan \nensures  the  collection  of  sex-disaggregated  data  for  planning  and  decision  support;  gender \nsensitivity  for  information,  education,  and  communication  campaigns;  participation  in  training \nevents;  promotion  of  career  development;  and  attention  to  training  that  addresses  high-risk \ngroups. \n\nE. \n\nSafeguards \n\n27. \nEnvironment. The project is classified category B. An initial environmental examination \n(IEE),  including  an  environmental  management  plan  (EMP),  was  prepared  in  compliance  with \nADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009)  and  the  Mongolia  regulatory  framework,  and  was \nposted on the ADB website on 21 August 2012. The IEE assesses and addresses environment \nimpacts  and  risks  related  to  (i)  the  Ulaanbaatar  central  medical  waste  management  facility; \n(ii) the new NTC; (iii) smaller blood safety, infection prevention and control, and medical waste \nfacility  installations  in  project  aimags;  and  (iv)  project-associated  facilities.  The  main  adverse \nimpacts  and  risks  during  the  construction  and  operation  phase  include  limited  standard \nconstruction impacts, and risks related to unsafe collection, storage, treatment, and disposal of \nmedical and chemical liquid waste generated by health facilities. These impacts and risks will be \naddressed  through  implementation  of  the  EMP,  which  includes  adequate  mitigation  and \nmonitoring  arrangements, \nimplementation  and  supervision, \nenvironmental training and capacity building, and budgets for EMP implementation. \n\nresponsibilities \n\nfor  EMP \n\nThe  EMP  will  be  updated  based  on  the  final  design  and  will  be  submitted  to  ADB  for \n28. \nreview and approval prior to awarding the civil works contract. Contractors during construction, \nand facility operators as well as the MOH during operation, will implement these measures. The \neffectiveness  of  these  measures  will  be  regularly  evaluated  in  the  framework  of  the \nenvironmental monitoring program, and corrective actions defined as required. The Government \nof  Mongolia,  through  the  MOH,  is  committed  to  manage  identified  environmental  risks  and \nagreed  on  a  comprehensive  set  of  loan  covenants.  Relevant  environment  information  was \ndisclosed to potentially affected people, and the results and findings of the consultation process \nwere used to modify the IEE and the project design. Consultation and participation will continue \nthroughout  project  implementation  and  any  environmental  complaints  or  disputes  will  be \nhandled in accordance with the grievance redress mechanism established for the project. The \nproject will have significant environment, health, and safety benefits. Mongolia\u2019s medical waste \nmanagement  system,  including  liquid  hazardous  waste,  will  be  significantly  strengthened \nthrough  improving  medical  waste  management  systems  within  health  care  facilities,  by \nupgrading  the  central  medical  waste  management  facility  in  Ulaanbaatar  to  meet  international \nstandards. \n\n29. \nInvoluntary  resettlement  and  indigenous  peoples.  No  involuntary  resettlement \neffects are foreseen and the project is classified category C. The new NTC will be established \non  existing  government  land  and  will  not  affect  local  residents  or  residential  buildings. \nTherefore,  a  resettlement  plan  and  a   resettlement  framework  are  not  required.  Should  there \nbe  any  change  in  scope  or  other  changes  with  unanticipated  resettlement  impacts  during \nproject  implementation,  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  activities  will  be  implemented  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement.  The  project  is  classified  category  C  for \nindigenous  peoples.  The  assessment  determined  that  no  negative  impacts  will  exist  for \nindigenous peoples. The project will carry out an assessment of and implement effective ways \nto  design  and  deliver  information,  education,  and  communication  activities  to  the  public  to \nensure social inclusiveness and effective communication. \n\n \n\n9\n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\nF. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n30. \nThe overall benefits and impacts are expected to outweigh the costs and risks involved. \nMajor risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail in the \nrisk assessment and risk management plan.17 \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nRisks \nDelayed establishment of the new national \ntransfusiology center caused by lack of \ngovernment investment, late assignment of \nstaff, and insufficient allocation of recurrent \nfunds  \nHigh inflation and appreciating local currency \ncaused by the booming economy result in \nescalating project costs. \nCorruption practices and risks in financial \nmanagement and procurement \n\nMitigating Measures \n\nADB and the PIU will monitor inclusion of adequate \ninvestment and recurrent funding in the MOH budget, \n2013\u20132014.
