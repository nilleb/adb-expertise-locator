I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto Mongolia for the Fifth Health Sector Development Project.1 \n2.  The project will improve patients\u2019 and health workers\u2019 safety in hospitals in Mongolia. It \nwill (i) improve the safety of blood transfusions, (ii) strengthen medical waste management, and \n(iii)  prevent  and  control  hospital-acquired  infections. 2  It  complements  previous  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) initiatives in the health sector in Mongolia. \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.  Mongolia\u2019s economic outlook is bright, but the country is experiencing severe shortages \nin the provision of social services. The cost of reforming the hospital sector in Ulaanbaatar alone \nis estimated at $450 million.3 At the same time, international support to the health sector is \nshrinking. Capacity is inadequate to implement reforms to improve the accessibility and service \nquality of hospital services. Poorer segments of the population have limited access to private \nhospitals because of the high cost of care and limited health insurance coverage. The safety of \npatients and health workers is compromised by lapses in hospital hygiene, blood transfusion \npractices, and medical waste management in the public and private sectors. \n4.  The  government  seeks  to  strengthen  blood  safety  in  hospitals  and  improve \npreparedness for emergencies in case of natural disasters. Deficiencies in aimag (province) \nblood banks impact on patients\u2019 and health workers\u2019 safety. Inadequate facilities, equipment, \nand  testing  materials;  inadequate  capacity  of  personnel  involved  in  blood  safety;  lack  of \nconfidentiality;  poor  registration  and  reporting  of  adverse  reactions;  lack  of  readiness  for \nemergencies; and lack of measures to reduce inappropriate blood transfusions are among the \nmajor deficiencies, which can result in unintentional transmission of HIV, syphilis, and hepatitis \nB and C. \n5.  Efforts are under way in Ulaanbaatar and in medium-sized cities such as Darkhan and \nErdenet to improve hospital medical waste treatment and disposal, but the situation in the \naimags is far from ideal. Management of liquid hazardous waste produced by hospitals and \nlaboratories is inadequate. Liquid hazardous waste, when poorly disposed of, causes harm to \npeople  and  the  environment,  as  it  contains  chemical  substances,  drugs,  and  pathogens. \nHospital sewerage systems are not always of good quality, resulting in environmental and public \nhealth risks.  \n6.  Infection  control  in  Mongolian  health  care  facilities  is  poor  and  hospital-acquired \ninfections are thought to be underreported.4 In March 2010, Mongolia experienced 28 hospital-\nacquired infections among newborns, of whom five died, as a result of poor infection control \nclinical practices. The prevalence of hepatitis B and C among health care workers in Mongolia is \n                                                 \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided project preparatory technical assistance ($700,000) funded by the \nJapan Fund for Poverty Reduction. ADB. 2011. Technical Assistance to Mongolia for Preparing the Fifth Health \nSector Development Project. Manila. \n3  Communication from consultant team of ADB. 2009. Technical Assistance to Mongolia for the Fourth Health Sector \nDevelopment: Improving Sector Governance. Manila (TA 7309-MON). \n4  Mongolia declared 85 cases of hospital-acquired infections in 2010 (Ministry of Health. 2011. Health Indicators. \nUlaanbaatar) against World Health Organization (WHO) estimates of 3.5%\u201310.0% of treated cases in hospitals in \nthe Asia and Pacific region; WHO estimates imply 21,000\u201370,000 expected cases of hospital-acquired infections in \nMongolia.  ", "2   \none of the highest in the world and points to breaches in health care safety.5 Sterilization \nfacilities  and  practices  in  hospitals  are  poor,  and  basic  hygiene  measures,  such  as  hand \nwashing, are not commonly implemented. The surveillance system currently implemented in \nhospitals consists of passive reporting of hospital-acquired infections. Several aspects prevent \nthe current passive surveillance system in hospitals from being effective: (i) the disincentive \nassociated with reporting of hospital-acquired infection cases; (ii) the widespread preventive use \nof antibiotics for surgery and other procedures, including for newborn babies; and (iii) the lack of \nmicrobiology capacity to detect infections and sensitivity to treatment. \n7.  The government has established a legal and regulatory framework to address the above \nshortcomings. However, it lacks investment funding; financing of operational costs; and human \nresources  capacity  to  implement  regulatory  measures,  guidelines,  and  plans.  Several \ninternational partners are supporting the government in these areas but significant gaps exist, \nprimarily investments, development of monitoring and surveillance systems, and institutional \nand human resources capacity development.6 Private investors are entering the hospital market, \nintending to offer higher standards of care for more affluent patients. 7 Public hospitals (with a \ngreater bed capacity) lag behind and remain a serious threat to the safety of patients and health \nworkers. This perpetuates discrimination between poorer and more affluent population groups. \nA central facility for the treatment and disposal of medical wastes was established as a public\u2013\nprivate partnership in Ulaanbaatar in 2007 and has been operational since 2010. This initiative, \nalthough  requiring  major  investments,  is  a  solid  foundation  for  improved  medical  waste \nmanagement in the capital where almost half of the Mongolian population lives. Ulaanbaatar\u2019s \nNational Transfusiology Center (NTC), which provides blood transfusion services of acceptable \nquality,  can  play  an  important  role  in  capacity  development  and  monitoring  of  hospital \ntransfusion activities in Ulaanbaatar and in the aimags. \n8.  The  project  builds  on  hospital  sector  reforms  initiated  under  previous  ADB-funded \noperations in Mongolia. The Health Sector Development Program focused on hospital planning \nand licensing; the Second Health Sector Development Project supported hospital financing; \nhospital  efficiency  and  governance  is  supported  by  the  ongoing  Third  Health  Sector \nDevelopment Project; and the Fourth Health Sector Development Project, including additional \nfinancing is engaged in restructuring the hospital sector, especially in Ulaanbaatar, to rationalize \nhospital  capacity  and  services.8 Hospital  rationalization  needs  to  be  complemented  with \n                                                 \n5  Various publications since 1998 report a wide range of the prevalence of hepatitis B and C carriers in various \npopulation groups in Mongolia (blood donors, health care workers, general population, males, and outpatients). \nThe reported proportions vary from 8% to 29% for hepatitis B and from 2% to 48% for hepatitis C carriers. \n6  The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria; the Millennium Challenge Account; and the WHO \nsupport the government in blood safety, medical waste management, and infection prevention and control. The \nADB-funded Third Health Sector Development Project (ADB. 2007. Report and Recommendation of the President \nto the Board of Directors: Proposed Grant to Mongolia for the Third Health Sector Development Project. Manila) is \nsupporting the government, especially in medical waste management, and is closely coordinating with all other \npartners in the sector to avoid duplications. \n7  Songdo Hospital, a private Republic of Korea investment, opened in 2007 and provides secondary and partly \ntertiary medical care. Since early 2011, Gurvan Gal Private Hospital, a 110-bed hospital, provides quality care \nbased exclusively on out-of-pocket expenses. MSC, a private Mongolian group operating in the mining and other \nsectors, will start operating a 100-bed hospital with international standards from early 2013. \n8  ADB. 1997.

Major lessons learned described in para. 12 of the sector assessment9 have \nbeen incorporated in the design of the project by continuing to support the hospital sector to see \nreform come to fruition, engaging in a wide consultation process on hospital restructuring, \nensuring  proper  baseline  data  collection  and  defining  meaningful  indicators,  and  providing \ncontinuous capacity building of the executing agency on ADB policies. The project will deliver \ntangible benefits to women by ensuring higher safety standards to protect staff, the majority of \nwhom  are  women,  against  hospital-acquired  infections  and  improving  the  safety  of  blood \ntransfusions in hospitals. \n9.  ADB is the largest external financier of the health sector in Mongolia, and plays a key \nrole in assisting the government to formulate and implement health sector reforms. Support from \nother partners focuses on assisting the government to address particular diseases or develop \ncertain  programs.  ADB  works  in  close  consultation  with  these  partners  to  support  the \ncoordinated implementation of the Health Sector Master Plan, 2006\u20132015. The World Health \nOrganization (WHO), with global expertise in all three focus areas of the project, will assist the \nproject mainly by providing consulting services. The German Federal Ministry of Health, which is \nsupporting  a  small-scale  hospital  hygiene  project  in  Mongolia,  will  support  the  project  by \nproviding advisory services for policy development, monitoring and evaluation, and training \nactivities in Mongolia and Germany. \n10.  The project builds on previous ADB health sector development initiatives and policy \nreforms under the Social Sectors Support Program10 to reform the Mongolian health sector in \nline with (i) the National Development Strategy in achieving Millennium Development Goals \n(MDGs) 4 (child health) and 5 (maternal health), and more directly MDG 6 (HIV/AIDS and \ntuberculosis) and MDG 7 (environmental health and sanitation); and (ii) the government\u2019s Health \nSector Master Plan, 2006\u20132015 for improving hospital services. The project is included in the \ncountry operations business plan, 2012\u2013201411 and is consistent with the country partnership \nstrategy,  2012\u20132016,12 which  emphasizes  social  development  through  efficient  delivery  of \nhealth services. \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n11.  The impact of the project will be improved quality of health services in Mongolia. The \noutcome will be improved patient and health worker safety in project-supported hospitals in \nMongolia. The project\u2019s geographical focus will include secondary and tertiary hospitals in \nUlaanbaatar, aimags, and soum (administrative subdivision of the aimag) centers. \nC.  Outputs \n12.  The project will have three components with the following outputs: \n                                                                                                                                                          \nBoard of Directors: Proposed Loan to Mongolia for Additional Financing of the Fourth Health Sector Development \nProject.

The project will assist in establishing \nthe new NTC in Ulaanbaatar13 by providing equipment, improving management \nsystems, implementing capacity building measures, and seeking international \naccreditation of the new NTC. A model maintenance unit will be developed in the \nNTC,  which  will  serve  as  a  basis  to  strengthen  maintenance  systems  and \ncapacities in hospitals covered by the project. The project will also improve blood \nsafety in aimag general hospitals and soum health centers, providing equipment, \ntraining  to  personnel  concerned,  and  organizing  blood  donor  management \nsystems, including public awareness-raising. \n(ii)  Component  2:  Medical  waste  management.  The  central  medical  waste \nmanagement  facility  in  Ulaanbaatar  will  be  upgraded  to  meet  internationally \naccepted standards by funding minor civil works, procuring equipment, improving \nmanagement  systems,  and  providing  capacity  building  for  personnel.  The \nmonitoring  and  inspection  capacity  of  the  Ministry  of  Health  (MOH)  and  the \nGeneral  Agency  for  Specialized  Inspection  on  medical  waste  will  be \nstrengthened. Medical waste management systems, including liquid hazardous \nwaste, will be improved to meet national standards in hospitals in Darkhan, \nErdenet,  and  Ulaanbaatar,  and  aimag  general  hospitals  by  providing  basic \nequipment, raising awareness and training personnel, and ensuring recurrent \nfunding for medical waste is sustained via proper costing and inclusion in the \nMOH budget. \n(iii)  Component  3:  Hospital  hygiene  and  infection  prevention  and  control. \nMicrobiology  laboratories  in  hospitals  in  Erdenet,  Darkhan,  Ulaanbaatar,  and \naimag  general  hospitals  will  be  provided  with  equipment  to  ensure  effective \ninfection  prevention  and  control,  and  existing  policies  and  guidelines  will  be \nreviewed and upgraded. In hospitals, basic infrastructure and equipment will be \ndeveloped, maintenance capacity will be strengthened, and adequate funding of \nrecurrent costs for infection prevention and control will be institutionalized. An \neffective surveillance system for hospital-acquired infections will be developed by \nimproving  policies  and  guidelines,  assigning  responsibilities,  developing \nincentives for proper reporting, and pilot testing the system. The awareness, \nknowledge,  and  capacity  of  health  authorities,  health  care  workers,  and \nadministrative  staff  on  infection  prevention  and  control  will  be  strengthened. \nInfection  prevention  and  control  will  be  incorporated  in  hospital  quality \nmanagement  systems,  and  an  improved  inspection  module  for  infection \nprevention  and  control  will  be  used  by  the  General  Agency  for  Specialized \nInspection to promote infection prevention and control. \nD.

Economic and Financial \n18.  The economic analysis evaluated the economic viability of the project as a whole. The \neconomic  analysis  covers  the  macroeconomic  context  to  review  the  potential  for  the \ngovernment  to  continue  to  finance  project  activities  in  the  longer  term  following  project \ncompletion. The analysis covers the quantifiable economic costs and benefits of the three \ncomponents  and  provides  a  qualitative  analysis  of  the  improved  safe  blood  transfusion \ncomponent and the medical waste management component. The economic impact of safe \nblood transfusion and medical waste management components includes a number of variables \nthat cannot appropriately be given a monetary value (e.g., years of life saved by reducing \ntransfusion-transmitted infections and improved treatment facilitated by greater availability of \nblood for transfusion). The economic impact of the medical waste management component is \npartially quantified (savings on energy consumption). Using conservative estimates of project \nimplementation, the baseline results show an economic internal rate of return (EIRR) of 17.51%. \nThe EIRR was tested through sensitivity analysis using a 20% decrease in economic benefits as \nthe  worst-case  scenario  for  all  economic  benefits.  Under  these  assumptions,  the  EIRR  is \n13.76%. The project is considered economically viable. \n19.  The project has no revenue-earning component, hence financial costs and benefits were \nnot analyzed. The financial sustainability of the project was assessed at the fiscal and project \nlevels.  An  analysis  of  recent  and  projected  government  expenditures  was  undertaken  to \nevaluate the potential impact of the project on the budget of the MOH. The MOH will contribute \ncounterpart  funding  and  shoulder  the  project\u2019s  O&M  costs  during  implementation.  The \ngovernment\u2019s annual share of project costs will average about $1.5 million or less than 0.6% of \nthe health sector annual budget in 2011. The recurrent costs of the project, to be borne by the \nGovernment of Mongolia, are estimated to be about $0.4 million per annum and include O&M \nand consumable costs of the project facilities. The annual recurrent costs to be borne by the \nexecuting agency will not exceed 0.15% of its current expenditure. Considering an average \ndepreciation value of $2 million per annum for the equipment, the recurrent cost impact will be \n$2.4 million per annum, which represents about 1% of the total recurrent costs of 2011. The \ncounterpart funding and O&M costs are considered both financially sustainable and affordable. \nA loan covenant makes provision for adequate counterpart funding (Table 4). \n ", "8   \nC.  Governance \n20.  The MOH is a long-term partner of ADB, and has been actively involved in implementing \nhealth  sector  development  projects  since  1991.  A  project  implementation  unit  (PIU)  was \nestablished as part of the ongoing Third and Fourth Health Sector Development Projects and \nthis arrangement will be expanded to incorporate implementation of the Fifth Health Sector \nDevelopment Project. \n21.  A procurement capability assessment conducted for the executing agency and the PIU \nconfirmed their general ability to conduct procurement in compliance with ADB policy and \nprocedural requirements and the relevant national laws and regulations on public procurement. \nThe implementing agencies have no or limited procurement experience using ADB policies \nand procedural requirements. Therefore, all procurement under the project will be carried out by \nthe executing agency and coordinated by the PIU. \n22.  Financial management assessments have been conducted for the MOH, Ulaanbaatar \nCity  Mayor\u2019s  Office,  the  NTC,  and  the  National  Center  for  Communicable  Diseases.  The \nassessments for the MOH, the Ulaanbaatar City Mayor\u2019s Office, and the PIU, carried out as part \nof project preparation of the Fourth Health Sector Development Project in 2010, were updated, \nand assessments of the NTC and the National Center for Communicable Diseases were carried \nout for preparation of the Fifth Health Sector Development Project. All four agencies have \nadequate accounting professionals and have computerized financial accounting and reporting \nsystems. Procedures on the flow of accounting, financial, and project physical progress related \nto  their  current  project  activities  are  available.  All  the  agencies  have  clearly  defined \nresponsibilities, with accountability assigned to different units at different levels of authority. \n23.  Annual audits for the project will be arranged by the Ministry of Finance. In general, \nthe  financial  management  assessment  concluded  that  the  current  financial  management \nsystem in the executing and implementing agencies meets government requirements in terms \nof  staffing,  accounting,  and  internal  control.  The  PIU  will  recruit  an  additional  technical \ncoordinator to strengthen its capacity to implement the project in compliance with the policy, \noperation, and procedural requirements of ADB. \n24.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the Government of Mongolia, the MOH, and implementing agencies. The specific policy \nrequirements and supplementary measures are described in the PAM (footnote 16). \nD.  Poverty and Social \n25.  The project will improve patients\u2019 and health workers\u2019 safety in hospitals in Mongolia. \nImproving the safety of blood transfusions will be applied nationwide and will reach a large \nproportion  of  the  Mongolian  population.  The  components  on  improving  medical  waste \nmanagement  and  prevention  and  control  of  hospital-acquired  infection  will  reach  about \n1,850,000 beneficiaries. About 13,500 health workers will also benefit directly, especially those \nwith professions that put them at occupational risk because of insufficient and unsecure blood \nproducts and processes. The project will provide gender and culturally sensitive information, \neducation, and communication on voluntary blood safety for the public to help address the \ndeficit in blood donations and fears of infections from the procedures. \n26.  Gender benefits. The project is designed to be effective gender mainstreaming. Women \nmake  up  82%  of  the  health  care  workforce.  Women  are  commonly  responsible  for  blood \nprocessing, infection prevention and control, waste management and handling, cleaning, and \n ", "  9\ndisinfection; and are most exposed to hospital-acquired infections and transfusion-transmitted \ninfections. Women also constitute the majority (about 80%) of hospital patients. A gender action \nplan has been developed for the project to ensure that gender is mainstreamed. The plan \nensures the collection of sex-disaggregated data for planning and decision support; gender \nsensitivity for information, education, and communication campaigns; participation in training \nevents; promotion of career development; and attention to training that addresses high-risk \ngroups. \nE.  Safeguards \n27.  Environment. The project is classified category B. An initial environmental examination \n(IEE), including an environmental management plan (EMP), was prepared in compliance with \nADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) and the Mongolia regulatory framework, and was \nposted on the ADB website on 21 August 2012. The IEE assesses and addresses environment \nimpacts and risks related to (i) the Ulaanbaatar central medical waste management facility; \n(ii) the new NTC; (iii) smaller blood safety, infection prevention and control, and medical waste \nfacility installations in project aimags; and (iv) project-associated facilities. The main adverse \nimpacts  and  risks  during  the  construction  and  operation  phase  include  limited  standard \nconstruction impacts, and risks related to unsafe collection, storage, treatment, and disposal of \nmedical and chemical liquid waste generated by health facilities. These impacts and risks will be \naddressed  through  implementation  of  the  EMP,  which  includes  adequate  mitigation  and \nmonitoring  arrangements,  responsibilities  for  EMP  implementation  and  supervision, \nenvironmental training and capacity building, and budgets for EMP implementation. \n28.  The EMP will be updated based on the final design and will be submitted to ADB for \nreview and approval prior to awarding the civil works contract. Contractors during construction, \nand facility operators as well as the MOH during operation, will implement these measures. The \neffectiveness  of  these  measures  will  be  regularly  evaluated  in  the  framework  of  the \nenvironmental monitoring program, and corrective actions defined as required. The Government \nof Mongolia, through the MOH, is committed to manage identified environmental risks and \nagreed on a comprehensive set of loan covenants. Relevant environment information was \ndisclosed to potentially affected people, and the results and findings of the consultation process \nwere used to modify the IEE and the project design. Consultation and participation will continue \nthroughout  project  implementation  and  any  environmental  complaints  or  disputes  will  be \nhandled in accordance with the grievance redress mechanism established for the project. The \nproject will have significant environment, health, and safety benefits. Mongolia\u2019s medical waste \nmanagement  system,  including  liquid  hazardous  waste,  will  be  significantly  strengthened \nthrough  improving  medical  waste  management  systems  within  health  care  facilities,  by \nupgrading the central medical waste management facility in Ulaanbaatar to meet international \nstandards. \n29.  Involuntary  resettlement  and  indigenous  peoples.  No  involuntary  resettlement \neffects are foreseen and the project is classified category C. The new NTC will be established \non  existing  government  land  and  will  not  affect  local  residents  or  residential  buildings. \nTherefore, a resettlement plan and a resettlement framework are not required. Should there \nbe  any  change  in scope or  other  changes with  unanticipated resettlement impacts during \nproject  implementation,  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  activities  will  be  implemented  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. The project is classified category C for \nindigenous  peoples.  The  assessment  determined  that  no  negative  impacts  will  exist  for \nindigenous peoples. The project will carry out an assessment of and implement effective ways \nto design and deliver information, education, and communication activities to the public to \nensure social inclusiveness and effective communication. \n ", "10  \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n30.  The overall benefits and impacts are expected to outweigh the costs and risks involved. \nMajor risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail in the \nrisk assessment and risk management plan.17 \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nDelayed establishment of the new national  ADB and the PIU will monitor inclusion of adequate \ntransfusiology center caused by lack of  investment and recurrent funding in the MOH budget, \ngovernment investment, late assignment of  2013\u20132014.

ASSURANCES AND CONDITION \n31.  The government and the MOH have assured ADB that implementation of the project \nshall  conform  to  all  applicable  ADB  policies,  including  those  concerning  anticorruption \nmeasures,  safeguards,  gender,  procurement,  consulting  services,  and  disbursement,  as \ndescribed in detail in the PAM and loan documents. \n32.  The government and the MOH have agreed with ADB on certain covenants for the \nproject, which are set forth in the loan agreement. \n33.  The government has also agreed that no withdrawals will be made from the loan account \nfor the procurement of equipment for the NTC under output 1 until ADB is satisfied that the \nMOH\u2019s budget allocation in 2013 and 2014 will have included the required cost of construction \nof the NTC. \nV.
