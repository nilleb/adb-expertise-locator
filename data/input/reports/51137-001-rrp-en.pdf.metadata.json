The \nreport also describes (i) the proposed administration of a grant to be provided by the Japan Fund \nfor the Joint Crediting Mechanism (JFJCM); and (ii) the proposed administration of a grant to be \nprovided  by  the  Republic  of  Korea  e-Asia  and  Knowledge  Partnership  Fund  (EAKPF)  for  the \nSouthwest Transmission Grid Expansion Project, and if the Board approves the proposed loan, I, \nacting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, approve the administration of the grants. \n \n2. \nthe  Government  of  Bangladesh\u2019s  target  to  achieve  electricity  for  all  by  2021 \n(i) constructing (a) a 400/132-kilovolt (kV) substation at Gopalganj; (b) a 230 kV transmission line \nin the southern zone, from Barisal to Faridpur; and (c) a 400 kV transmission line in the western \nzone,  from  Bogra  to  Rohanpur;  and  (ii)  implementing  a  capacity  development  program  in  the \nelectric utility industry to promote socially and gender inclusive growth. The project will use state-\nof-the-art conductors with higher power transmission capacity and lower energy loss in both the \n230 kV and 400 kV transmission lines.  \n \n\nThe project will improve the operational performance of the power sector and contribute to \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\n3. \nBangladesh has sustained an average annual economic growth rate of 6.5% since 2007, \ndespite the 2008\u20132009 global financial crisis.1 Bangladesh is now evolving into a middle-income \ncountry2 since  its  gross  domestic  product  per  capita  has  risen  steadily  from  $1,110  in  2014  to \n$1,544 in 2017. The structure of the Bangladesh economy is gradually shifting from agriculture to \nmanufacturing  and  services.  Poverty  has  been  halved  since  2000,  and  many  of  the  Millennium \nDevelopment Goal targets have been met. Building on these achievements, the government has \nset new priority targets to (i) accelerate the annual economic growth to 7.5% to move to middle-\nincome status by 2021; (ii) create jobs and support rural development to engender inclusive growth \nand  poverty  reduction;  (iii)  reduce  poverty  from  24.8%  in  2015  to  18.6%  in  2020,  and  extreme \npoverty from 12.9% in 2015 to about 8.9% in 2020; and (iv) reduce environmental degradation and \nclimate change vulnerabilities.3 \n \n4. \nDespite its economic success, the country faces major challenges in its effort to maintain \nthe  growth  trend  and  move  closer  to  upper  middle-income  status  because  of  infrastructure \ndeficiencies. Addressing infrastructure deficiencies is therefore a top priority of the government. A \nmajor challenge is to provide modern and affordable energy services to those who lack access. \nInadequate energy could result in loss of productivity and competitiveness and become a constraint \nto faster growth and greater investment in the short to medium term. To mitigate this constraint and \nsustain  the  country\u2019s  economic  momentum,  the  government  has  prepared  the  Power  System \nMaster  Plan4 to  increase  power  generation  capacity,  as  well  as  improve  and  extend  the  power \n\n                                                \n1  Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics. http://www.bbs.gov.bd/ (accessed 1 March 2018). \n2  ADBI.  2017.  Working  Paper  Series:  Middle-Class  Composition  and  Growth  in  Middle-Income  Countries.  Tokyo. \nhttps://www.adb.org/sites/default/files/publication/325056/adbi-wp753.pdf.  A  country  is  classified  as  lower  middle-\nincome if its  gross domestic product per capita is between $2,250 and $7,500, as upper middle-income if it is between \n$7,500 and $14,500.  \n\n3  Government  of  Bangladesh,  Planning  Commission.  2015.

Power  System  Master  Plan \n\n2016. Dhaka. \n\n \n\n\ftransmission and distribution network, with the aim of achieving universal access to electricity by \n2021. \n \n5. \nThe  power  sector  in  Bangladesh  is  characterized  by  recurring  shortages  of  electricity-\ngenerating capacity in the face of ever-rising demand in a growing economy. In fiscal year (FY) \n2015, per capita electricity consumption was 310 kilowatt-hours. This figure was lower than most \nother countries in South Asia, indicating that power sector infrastructure facilities require significant \ncapacity  additions.  In  FY2017,  peak  demand  was  estimated  at  10,400  megawatts  (MW)  while \navailable generation capacity was 9,479 MW. A significant amount of demand was met by supply \nfrom  captive  generation  and  load  shedding.5 Existing  generation  capacity  gradually  retires  and \nneeds to be replaced, while net peak demand has continued to increase; it is forecasted to exceed \n13,300 MW by 2020 and 19,900 MW by 2025. Further, the national electricity access in FY2017 \nmasks a stark urban\u2013rural disparity, with access to electricity at over 90% in urban areas and only \n40% in rural areas. Also, despite substantial improvement in operational and financial performance, \nweak financial management capacities of the sector entities and below cost-recovery power tariffs \ncontinue to impair the financial health of the sector entities. \n \n6. \nBangladesh\u2019s  power generation  expansion  plan  intends  to  provide  the  required generation \ncapacity  to  meet  the  increasing  demand  and  the  government\u2019s  electrification  goals,  including \ndelivering  services  to  those  not  connected  to grid  electricity  (footnote  4).  Further,  Bangladesh\u2019s \nSeventh  Five  Year  Plan  (footnote  3)  envisages  an  integrated  development  strategy  for  the \nsouthwest region encompassing Dhaka, Khulna, and Barisal. The power sector will play a critical \nrole  in  realizing  the  government\u2019s  vision  for  promoting  economic  and  industrial  growth  in  the \nsouthwest region. \n \n7. \nThe past sector progress comprises (i) creating an enabling business environment for the \nprivate sector, (ii) implementing power transmission interconnection with India, (iii) increasing clean \nenergy  investment  in  wind  and  solar,  and  (iv)  strengthening  the  transmission  network  to \naccommodate  expected  additional  power  generation  capacity.  The  sector  reform  actions  so  far \nhave  contributed  to  considerable  achievements,  including  the  following:  (i)  the  establishment  in \n2004 of Bangladesh Energy Regulatory Commission (BERC), and (ii) the approval in 2016 of an \nelectricity transmission tariff fixation methodology. There are still areas for further improvement and \ncapacity building, such as financial management and corporate governance in power utilities. \n \n8. \nInvestments in network strengthening and measures to reduce nontechnical losses have resulted \nin a significant decline of overall system losses from over 30% of generation in the 1990s to 13%\u2013\n15% of generation at present. The number of interruptions because of transmission system issues, \nhowever, increased from two incidents in FY2016 to 15 incidents in FY2017, with the cumulative \nduration  of  outages  more  than  doubling  from  almost  17  hours  to  39  hours.  Investments  in  the \ntransmission network are needed to reduce the number of interruptions and further reduction of \nsystem  losses.  Therefore,  addressing  deficiencies  in  the  transmission  network  remains  a  top \npriority of the government. Investments in transmission infrastructure will also be essential to help \nBangladesh (i) achieve its goal of achieving energy security (in line with Sustainable Development \nGoal  7), 6  (ii)  accelerate  its  economic  growth,  (iii)  improve  living  standards  of  its  population,                       \n(iv) create meaningful jobs, and (v) attain upper middle-income status. A highly skilled workforce is \nrequired  to  modernize  power  infrastructure  with  advanced  technologies.  Utilities  have  not  been \n\nDespite improved efficiency from  power sector reforms, transmission challenges remain.   \n\n                                                \n5  BPDB. 2018. Annual Report 2016\u20132017. Dhaka. Bangladesh Power Development Board estimates that load shedding \n\nat peak times in FY2017 was about 250 MW. \n\n6  Sustainable Development Goal 7 is to ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy for all.   \n\n2 \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n3 \n\nsuccessful in enhancing the capacity of current employees or acquiring new employees with the \nneeded skills to operate the power system effectively and efficiently. \n \n9. \nTo address the issues in para. 5, the government has formulated a strategy and set targets \nfor the power sector, as stipulated in Vision 20217 and the Seventh Five Year Plan (footnote 3). \nThese  include,  among  others,  (i)  increasing  generation  capacity  by  23,000  MW,  (ii)  reducing \ncombined transmission and distribution losses from 13% to 9% of generation, and (iii) providing \nuninterrupted power supply to industries, all by 2020. The project is also aligned with the Energy \nPolicy8 of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  the  priorities  of  ADB\u2019s  country  partnership \nstrategy for Bangladesh, 2016\u20132020.9 \n \n10. \nInadequate  transmission  lines  and  substation  transformer  capacities  in  southern  and \nwestern regions are the main contributors to transmission bottlenecks. In tandem with increased \npower  generation  capacity,  investments  in  the  transmission  network  are  required  to  address \ntransmission bottlenecks for the evacuation of bulk power from power stations to major load centers \nsuch  as  Greater  Dhaka,  Chittagong,  and  the  southwest  economic  corridor.    At  the  same  time, \nconstruction  of  new  transmission  lines  has  become  more  challenging  because  of  the  high \npopulation density and limited rights-of-way (ROWs). \n \n11. \nValue added by ADB assistance. The proposed Southwest Transmission Grid Expansion \nProject  builds  upon  ADB\u2019s  strong  and  sustained  work  in  the  power  sector  of  Bangladesh  and \nembraces ADB\u2019s sector knowledge and synergistic approach in developing all energy subsectors.  \nComplementing the investment in the recently-approved Rupsha 800-Megawatt Combined Cycle \nPower  Plant  in the  southwest  region,10 the  proposed  project  will focus  on  addressing continuing \ndeficiencies in the transmission system and will enhance power transfer capacity to the load centers \nof the southern and western zones. The project will use advanced efficient conductor technology \nas  a  cost-effective  solution  to  allow  more  power  transfer  at  lower  energy  loss  in  the  new \ntransmission  lines.  The  project  will  minimize  the  ROW  requirements  and  mitigate  potential \nsafeguard issues.11 Further, the project will initiate a capacity  development program focusing on \nnew technologies and trends in power systems, with an emphasis on gender and social inclusion, \nwhich will help the long-term sustainability of the Bangladeshi power sector. The project will also \nsupport further sector reforms by strengthening financial management capacity  and governance \nstructure of the power utilities while accelerating transmission tariff approvals by BERC. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nB. \n \nThe  project  is  aligned  with  the  following  impacts:  (i)  national  target  of  electricity  for  all \n12. \nachieved by 2021 (footnote 7), and (ii) combined transmission and distribution losses reduced from \n13% to 9% of generation, and uninterrupted power supply provided to industries by 2020 (footnote \n\n                                                \n7  Government of Bangladesh, Ministry of Planning, Planning Commission. 2012.

The components identified under the \nproject  are  part  of  the  government\u2019s  Power  System  Master  Plan  2016  (footnote  4)  and  will  be \nimplemented as part of the Seventh Five Year Plan (footnote 3). An assessment rated the project\u2019s \nclimate change impact as low since the project adopts a range of control measures, including using \nhigh-temperature,  low-sag  conductors  and  tower  foundation  leveling  to  address  the  relevant \nclimate risks. Details are in the PAM (footnote 14). \n \n\n6 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n7 \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\nB. \n \n25. \nThe  economic  analysis  was  carried  out  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  the \nEconomic  Analysis  of  Projects. 15  A  period  of  rapid  economic  development  is  expected  in \nBangladesh from 2018 to 2020, and a considerable increase in electricity demand is forecasted to \nmatch this economic growth. With this project, the primary economic benefit of the transmission \nnetwork in southern and western Bangladesh will be the additional power supplied to consumers \nfrom  the  current  and  newly  established  power  generation  facilities;  these  consumers  would  be \notherwise unserved. Further, the use of efficient conductors will reduce transmission loss. \n \n26. \nIn the economic analysis, all costs and benefits were expressed in constant 2017 prices. \nCapital  costs  and  operation  and  maintenance  costs  were  taken  from  the  financial  data,  with \nappropriate  adjustments  exclusive  of  taxes  and  price  contingencies.  Components  1,  2,  and  3 \n(leading to outputs 1, 2, and 3) were assessed to be economically viable when economic analyses \nof individual outputs were undertaken, resulting in economic internal rates of return of 17.6% for \ncomponents  1  and  2  and  16.7%  for  component  3.  The  overall  project  economic  internal  rate  of \nreturn is estimated to be 17.4%. The project\u2019s economic returns are resilient to adverse changes \nin  input  parameters,  including  a  10%  increase  in  capital  costs  and  operation  and  maintenance \ncosts, a 1-year delay in construction, and a 10% decrease in fuel price. The analysis demonstrates \nthe economic feasibility of the project. \n \n27. \nThe financial analysis of the project was carried out in accordance with ADB's Guidelines \non  the  Financial  Management  and  Analysis  of  Projects.16 All  financial  costs  and  benefits  were \nexpressed in constant 2017 prices. Financial viability was assessed by comparing the incremental \ncosts and benefits of the project over the project lifetime. The incremental benefits for outputs 1\u20133 \nwere  based  on  the  incremental  electricity  transferred  under  the  project  assets  valued  at  the \ntransmission services tariff set by BERC under the approved transmission tariff methodology.17 \n \nAn  asset-based  revenue  model  following  the  tariff  regulation  was  used  to  determine  the \n28. \nfinancial internal rate of return of the project. The weighted average cost of capital of the project is \nestimated to be 1.90%. The project\u2019s financial internal rate of return was assessed to be 3.46%. \nThe project\u2019s sensitivity to adverse changes in the underlying assumptions was assessed and the \nanalysis demonstrated that the project\u2019s financial viability is robust. \n \nC. \n \nPGCB is a public limited company incorporated in 1996 under the Companies Act, 1994. \n29. \nBangladesh Power Development Board, a wholly government-owned entity, owns 76.25% of the \nshare  capital  of  PGCB.  PGCB  has  the  responsibility  to  own,  operate,  and  expand  the  national \npower  grid.  It  has  been  the  executing  agency  for  several  ADB-financed  projects  since  its \nestablishment, and it has adequate capacity and experience to undertake the proposed project. It \nhas capabilities in public procurement and knowledge of ADB\u2019s procurement processes. \n \n30. \nThe financial management risk of PGCB is rated substantial, and PGCB has prepared an \naction  plan  to  address  this  risk.  Considering  the  volume  of  operations  and  future  development \nplans, PGCB needs to strengthen its finance function, including by (i) appointing key personnel to \nits  finance  division,  (ii)  retaining  adequate  and  qualified  staff  in  its  accounting  department,  and              \n                                                \n15 ADB. 2017.Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects.

ADB has completed integrity due diligence on PGCB and identified \nno  significant  integrity  risk  to  the  project.18 The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary \nmeasures are described in the PAM (footnote 14). \n \nD. \n \n32. \nBangladesh is the eighth most populated country in the world, with a population of about \n162 million in 2017. About 64% of the population lives in rural areas and nearly 41% of the labor \nforce  is  engaged  in  agriculture.19 Extreme  poverty  has  declined  considerably  in  rural  areas:  the \nproportion of rural population living in extreme poverty dropped from 34.3% in 2000 to 12.9% in \n2015. 20  The  main  drivers  of  this  decline  in  poverty  are  faster  economic  growth,  increasing \nurbanization,  rising  labor  productivity  and  wages,  a  shift  from  low-return  agricultural  labor  to \nnonfarm employment, and growth in export industries. \n \n33. \nPoverty  and  social.  The  major  benefit  of  the  project  is  enhanced  energy  security  and \nadditional  electricity  supply  that  will  promote  business  expansion  and  create  employment \nopportunities for local communities, including poor and socially disadvantaged people, during the \noperational phase. The project will also generate jobs for local communities during construction as \na direct benefit. Further, through a capacity development program funded by the proposed EAKPF \ngrant, human resources development in the energy sector will be improved. \n \n34. \nGender. The project is categorized as having some gender elements. Under the proposed \nEAKPF  grant,  the  project  will  support  about  50  students  in  universities  and  30  professionals  in \nPGCB to continue their education. Among the beneficiaries, 40% of the students and 30% of the \nprofessionals  will  be  women.  This  will  directly  support  women\u2019s  access  to  higher  education \nopportunities. Further, this component will increase women\u2019s participation in the energy sector and \nencourage socially inclusive capacity in the electric utility industry. \n \nE. \n \n35. \ncategories are as follows.21 \n \n36. \nEnvironment  (category  B).  The  project  will  not  pass  through  any  ecologically  sensitive \nareas  and  will  not  bring  significant  adverse  environmental  impacts.  An  initial  environmental \nexamination (IEE) has been prepared in accordance with the Safeguard Policy Statement. The IEE \nand environmental management plan propose mitigation measures to minimize effluent, noise, and \nwaste from the project that may impact the environment, health, and safety. PGCB will disclose \nany  updates  to  the  IEE  resulting  from  some  changes  in  project  scope.  The  project  will  utilize \naluminum conductor composite core cable in the transmission lines under outputs 2 and 3 as an \nadvanced  technology  to  reduce  greenhouse  gas  emissions  by  174,595  tons  of  carbon  dioxide-\n\nIn  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),  the  project\u2019s  safeguard \n\nSafeguards \n\n                                                \n18 ADB. 2003.

The project has been assessed for its risk and vulnerability to climate change \nimpacts, and design measures have been integrated to minimize these risks. The draft IEE report \nwas prepared from the technical due diligence and fact-finding mission. PGCB has implemented \nseveral  ADB  projects  and  has  adequate  institutional  capacity  and  experience  to  manage  the \nenvironmental risks through its project management unit. PGCB is committed to implementing the \nenvironmental  management  plan  and  submitting  environmental  monitoring  reports  on  a  regular \nbasis to ADB. \n \nInvoluntary resettlement (category A). The substations and transmission line alignments \n37. \nhave been carefully designed to minimize land acquisition and involuntary resettlement. The three \nsubstations  require  acquisition  of  approximately  40  hectares  of  land,  and  266  households  with \n1,183 persons may be affected by the land acquisition. PGCB has  identified  138 households with \n552  persons  who  are  expected  to  be  significantly  affected.  The  impacts  of  the  268  km  of \ntransmission  lines  are  mostly  temporary,  but  some  are  permanent  on  the  land  along  the  ROW. \nAccording to the transmission lines route survey done by PGCB based on the preliminary design, \napproximately 919 households comprising 3,676 persons may be affected by the ROW, and among \nthem 77 households comprising 308 persons who own 89 structures may need relocation. PGCB \nwill try to avoid residential structures during implementation as much as possible to minimize the \nimpacts.  PGCB  has  undertaken  site  visits,  surveys,  and  necessary  due  diligence,  and  \ndisseminated relevant safeguard information during consultations and surveys. The resettlement \nplan  was  prepared  in  compliance  with  the  relevant  Government  of  Bangladesh  regulations  and \nADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  and  was  disclosed  on  ADB\u2019s  website  on  16  April  2018. \nMitigation measures and budgetary provisions are in place to provide compensation at replacement \ncost commensurate to the impacts, and to restore livelihoods. PGCB has an environmental and \nsocial unit and is experienced in implementing ADB projects. PGCB will engage a nongovernment \norganization to implement the resettlement plan and retain an external monitor to verify monitoring \ninformation for the project. The monitoring reports will be submitted by PGCB to ADB semiannually. \n \nIndigenous peoples (category C).
