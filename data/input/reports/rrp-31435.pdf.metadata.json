This objective will be achieved through a\nseries  of  interventions  in  the  next  several  years.  The\nproposed  Project  will  be  the  first  in  the  series  of\ninterventions.  The  Project  will  also  address  India\u2019s\nimmediate  need  to  reduce  capacity  shortage  in  the  NH\nsystems.  The  Project  will  finance  upgrading  of  the\nexisting  two-lane  single  carriageway  to  a  four-lane\ndivided  highway  on  the  Tumkur-Haveri  section  of  about\n259 kilometers (km) on part of National Highway 4 (NH4)\nin the state of Karnataka.\n\nAn initial environmental examination was undertaken and\nthe summary is attached as a core appendix.\n\nIndia\u2019s  highway  sector  has  long  suffered  from  lack  of\nfunding,  weak  capability  to  implement  projects,  poor\npolicy  coordination,  and  resultant  delay  in  decision\nmaking.  Launching  a  national  highway  development\nprogram  (NHDP)  of  an  unprecedented  scale, \nthe\nGovernment  decided  to  address  these  long-standing\nproblems.  The  Government  has  taken  a  number  of\nactions  to  boost  the  source  of  funds  for  highway\ndevelopment  and  facilitate  private  sector  participation  in\nhighway  development  and  maintenance.  While  these\nactions  have  significantly  contributed  to  resolving  the\nproblems,  major  challenges  still  remain.  These  include\nintroducing  more  sophisticated  financial  instruments,\ndiversifying  methods  of  involving  the  private  sector,  and\nenhancing  financial  and  managerial  autonomy  of  the\nNational  Highways  Authority  of  India  (NHAI)  with  the\neventual  goal  of  corporatization.  These  challenges\ncannot  be  addressed  by  a  one-time  intervention.  ADB\nenvisages  taking  a  programmatic  approach  to  address\nthese challenges from a longer term perspective.\n\nimminent  needs \n\nBeside  these  longer  term  challenges,  the  Government\ninadequate\nfaces \ncapacity  of \nthe\nthe  golden\nGovernment  program \n\nto  alleviate \nthe  NH  systems.  A  core  part  of \n\nto  upgrade \n\nthe \n\nis \n\n\fiii\n\nquadrilateral  (GQ),  6,000  km  of  the  national  highway\nnetwork connecting four major metropolitan cities: Delhi,\nMumbai,  Chennai,  and  Kolkata.  The  western  transport\ncorridor  (WTC)  is  the  busiest  part  of  the  GQ,  passing\nRajasthan,  Gujarat,\nthrough \nMaharashtra, Karnataka, and Tamil Nadu states.\n\nHaryana, \n\nDelhi, \n\nGiven  the  higher  traffic  volume  of  the  WTC  over  other\nparts  of  the  GQ,  it  was  decided  to  apply  the  concept  of\npublic-private  partnership  (PPP)  along  this  corridor.  A\ndevelopment  strategy  based  on  the  PPP  concept  was\ndeveloped in 2000 under ADB technical assistance (TA).\nThe  strategy  identified  two  sections  as  pilot  projects:  (i)\nJaipur  bypass  project  using  PPP  funding,  and  (ii)\nTumkur-Haveri  project  using  public  sector  financing.\nNHAI  decided  to  develop  the  Jaipur  bypass  project  with\nthe  creation  of  a  special-purpose  vehicle  (SPV)  for  the\neventual  participation  of \nin\nthe  private  sector \ndevelopment, and operation and maintenance (O&M).\n\nFor the publicly funded portion, ADB proposes to extend\nfinancial  assistance \nthe  Tumkur-Haveri\nto  upgrade \nsection of NH4. This Project was designed to incorporate\na number of road safety features such as median strips,\nservice  roads,  bypass,  underpasses,  overpasses,  and\nfencing.  These  design \nfeatures  are  unprecedented\nelsewhere on the GQ to date and will act as a model for\nsafety awareness in designing similar highways in India\u2019s\nhighway sector.\n\nThe  overall  objective  of  the  Project  is  to  advance  policy\nreforms  in  India  to  create  an  enabling  environment  for\nthe  efficient  and  sustainable  development  of  the  NH\nsystem with substantial participation of the private sector.\nThe  policy  framework  developed  and  agreed  upon  with\nthe  Government  will  serve  as  a  road  map  for  future\nlending to India\u2019s highway sector.\n\nThe proposed Project is designed to achieve four specific\nobjectives:  (i)  remove  capacity  constraints  on  a  critical\nthe  WTC;  (ii)  enhance  road  safety  by\nsection  of \nintroducing  design \ntraffic\naccidents  and  minimize  negative \nimpacts  of  road\nconstruction on people in the Project\u2019s zone of influence;\n(iii)  enhance  the  corporate  finance  capability  of  NHAI;\nand  (iv)  increase  private  sector  participation  in  the\ndevelopment, and O&M of the NH system.\n\nthat  will  reduce \n\nfeatures \n\nTo  realize  these  objectives,  the  proposed  Project  will\nconsist  of  investment,  capacity-building,  and  project\nimplementation \nInvestment\ncomponents  include  those  for  (i)  upgrading  the  Tumkur-\n\ncomponents. \n\nsupport \n\nObjectives and Scope\n\n\fiv\n\nHaveri section of 259 km, and (ii) enhancing road safety\nby  incorporating  specific  design  features.

The  project\nimplementation support components include (i) providing\nconstruction  supervision  services,  and  (ii)  providing\nenvironmental  management  training  to  staff  of  NHAI,\ncontractors, and supervision consultants.\n\nThe total cost of the Project is estimated at $378 million\nequivalent.  The  foreign  exchange  cost  is  estimated  at\n$240 million (64 percent of the total project cost), and the\nlocal  currency  cost  at  $138  million  equivalent  (36\npercent).\n\nIt  is  proposed  that  ADB  provide  a  loan  of  $240  million,\ncovering the entire foreign exchange cost of the Project,\nwhile \nthe  Government  will  provide  $138  million\nequivalent to cover the entire local currency cost.\n\nSource\n\nForeign\nExchange\n\nLocal\nCurrency\n\nTotal\nCost\n\n($ million)\n\nPercent\n\nAsian Development  Bank\nGovernment\n\n         Total\n\n240\n0\n\n240\n\n0\n138\n\n138\n\n240\n138\n\n378\n\n64\n36\n\n100\n\nA  loan  of  $240  million  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital\nresources  will  be  provided  under  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based\nlending  facility.

While \nthe  proportion  of  Karnataka  State\u2019s\npopulation  below  the  poverty  line  is  above  the  national\naverage,  the  state  has  suffered  from  the  existence  of\nintrastate  discrepancy  in  the  poverty  ratio.  An  improved\nroad network will reduce this intrastate discrepancy by (i)\nenabling  villagers  to  shift  from  subsistence  farming  to\ncommercially  oriented  agricultural  surplus  production,\n\n\fvi\n\nand  (ii)  facilitating  the  rural  population\u2019s  movement  to\nbetter  paid  occupations  such  as  those  in  manufacturing\nor  trading.

Large traffic volumes on the mainly two-lane NH network inflict heavy social and\neconomic costs, adversely affecting all levels of society and all sectors of the national economy.\nDuring  the  1998  Country  Programming  Mission,  the  Government  requested  the  Asian\nDevelopment Bank (ADB) to consider financing a series of projects along the western transport\ncorridor (WTC) connecting the three major metropolitan cities of Delhi, Mumbai, and Chennai.\nThe first of these projects, the Surat-Manor Tollway Project, was approved by the Board in July\n2000.\n\n3.\nDuring  the  ADB  Country  Consultation  Mission  in  August  2000,  the  Government\nrequested that project processing for a second project commence at the earliest possible time\nwith use of detailed project reports prepared by NHAI\u2019s consultants. In response to this request,\na  Reconnaissance  Mission,  Fact-Finding  Mission,  and  Appraisal  Mission1  were  fielded  in\nSeptember 2000, November 2000, and February 2001, respectively. This report is based on the\nfindings of these missions. The overall project framework is in Appendix 1.\n\nA.\n\nSector Description\n\nIII.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\n4.\nIndia  has  an  extensive  and  diversified  transport  system  comprising  about  3.3  million\nkilometers  (km)  of  roads,  62,809  km  of  rail,  12  major  and  139  minor  ports,  four  major\ninternational airports, 86 domestic airports, and about 14,500 km of navigable inland waterways.\nThe modal mix between road and rail transport has been continuously shifting from rail to road\nbecause of changing demands for transport services. Consequently, road transport is now the\ndominant mode of transport, accounting for 60 percent of freight movement and 80 percent of\npassenger traffic, with rail transport accounting for much of the remainder. A profile of transport\nin India is given in Supplementary Appendix A.\n\n1. \n\nTransport Planning and Coordination\n\nTransport planning, coordination, and policy setting at the Central Government level are\n5.\nhandled  by  several  line  ministries,  with  overall  coordination  by  the  Planning  Commission.  A\nprevious  key  ministry,  Ministry  of  Surface  Transport  (MOST),  was  reorganized  in  November\n2000  into  two  ministries:  Ministry  of  Road  Transport  and  Highways  (MORTH)  and  Ministry  of\nShipping  and  Ports  (MOSP).  MORTH\u2019s  duties  relate  to  the  development  and  maintenance  of\nnational  highways,  and  policies  on  road  transport.  In  addition,  it  coordinates  state  roads  and\nissues guidelines on highway planning, design, and construction. MOSP is responsible for major\nports,  inland  water  transport,  and  shipping.  All  railway  planning  and  operations  are  under  the\n\n                                                          \n1 The project processing team comprised S. Tsukada, Senior Transport Specialist/Mission Leader, IWTC; T. Kandiah,\nSenior Investment/Programs Officer, INRM; P. Vallely, Transport Specialist, IWTC; V. S. Rekha, Counsel, OGC; R.\nJayewardene,  Resettlement  Specialist,  SOCD;  Yue-Lang  Feng,  Environmental  Specialist,  ENVD;  S.  Tukuafu,\nFinancial Management Specialist, IWOD; and J. Arnold, Consultant.\n\n\f2\n\nMinistry of Railways. The Ministry of Rural Development is responsible for policy development,\nmonitoring,  and  coordination  of  rural  roads.  Airports  and  civil  aviation  are  the  responsibility  of\nthe Ministry of Civil Aviation and Tourism.\n\nThe  responsibility \n\nfor  developing  and  maintaining  NH\u2019s  rests  with \n\n6.\nthe  central\nGovernment,  while  state  and  district  roads  are  the  responsibility  of  the  state  governments\nconcerned.  Because  it  is  desirable  to  separate  the  planning  and  operational  functions  of  the\ngovernment,  the  Government  established  NHAI  in  1988  as  its  operational  arm  for  NH\ndevelopment  and  maintenance.  NHAI  has  taken  over  a  designated  part  of  MORTH\u2019s\nresponsibility for developing and maintaining the NH system. NHAI\u2019s responsibilities include the\ngolden quadrilateral, north-south and east-west corridors, and several links to major ports and\nindustrial centers. NHAI covers one fourth of the national highway network length, and MORTH\nis responsible for the remaining part.\n\n2.\n\nRoad Network and Traffic\n\n7.\nThe  road  network  in  India  is  divided  into  three  categories:  (i)  NHs,  (ii)  state  highways,\nand  (iii)  district  roads  and  rural  roads  (Appendix  2).  The  national  and  state  highways  facilitate\nmobility  in  the  country\u2019s  transportation  system.  The  district  and  rural  roads  provide  the  much\nneeded means to meet social needs and to transport agricultural produce to markets. The road\nnetwork in India grew by 7.5 times from 400,000 km in 1951 to 3.3 million km in 2000 (including\n200,000  km  of  urban  roads).  Road  density  is  now  1.0  km  per  square  km,  which  compares\nfavorably with that in other developing countries. But despite the length of the road network, its\nquality and capacity are grossly inadequate for present and future demand for freight transport\nand passenger traffic.\n\n8.\nThe NH network of 57,700 km carries about 40 percent of total road traffic.  However, 39\npercent of this national highway network is still of single-lane standard, 59 percent is two lanes,\nand the four-lane highways, account for only 2 percent.\n\n9.\nOver  the  last  10  years  from  fiscal  year  (FY)  1990/91  to  1999/2000,  annual  passenger\ntransport by road grew at the rate of 7.8 percent and freight transport by 7.6 percent, which is\nslightly  higher  than  the  growth  rate  of  the  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  (7.5  percent)  for  the\nsame period. By 2001, passenger traffic is expected to reach about 3,000 billion passenger-km\nand freight traffic, 800 billion ton-km.\n\n3.\n\nVehicle Fleet and Road Transport Industries\n\n10.\nThe  vehicle  population  grew  from  300,000  in  1950/51  to  an  estimated  50  million  in\n1999/2000.  Buses  and  trucks  accounted  for  1  percent  and  5  percent,  respectively,  cars  and\njeeps  for  12  percent,  and  motorcycles  and  scooters  (two-wheelers)  for  68  percent;  the\nremaining  vehicles  were  mostly  autorickshaws  (three-wheelers)  and  agricultural  tractors.\nNationally,  the  number  of  automobiles  has  been  growing  at  approximately  5  percent  a  year,\nwhereas heavy commercial vehicles have registered a growth rate of 6 percent over the last 10\nyears.\n\n11.\nIndia\u2019s  automobile  manufacturing  industry  has  been  regulated  since  independence.  In\n1947, the Government declared that only indigenous firms operating according to an approved\nplan could manufacture motor vehicles. This led to the establishment of a vehicle manufacturing\nindustry  basically  using  domestic  capital  with  little  use  of  foreign  technologies.  Deregulation\nstarted with the two-wheeler segment in mid-1980s. It was followed by opening up of passenger\ncar  and  commercial  vehicle  segments  in  1990s  to  encourage  the  production  of  more  fuel-\nefficient,  safer,  and  better  quality  vehicles  at  reasonable  prices.  In  1996/97,  3.1  million  motor\n\n\f3\n\nvehicles were manufactured in India, an increase of 114 percent over the 1992/93 level, due to\nthe unprecedented increase in manufacturing two- and three-wheeler vehicles \u2013 from 1.1 million\nto 2.6 million during the same period.\n\n12.\nThe  private  sector  almost  wholly  provides  road  freight  operations.  The  national  freight\nfleet increased from 963,000 in 1985/86 to 2,600,000 in 1999/2000. Light commercial vehicles\nincreased  much  faster  than  the  heavy  commercial  vehicles.  The  industry  has  a  multilevel\nstructure. Shippers usually contact transport companies that have financial capability to assume\nlegal  liabilities  associated  with  cargo  haulage.  Since  these  transport  companies  have  limited\ntrucking fleet, most trucking services are provided with the use of trucks to be arranged by cargo\nbrokers.  When  transport  companies  receive  order  from  shippers,  they  contact  cargo  brokers\nbased  in  the  regions  where  the  cargo  originates.  These  brokers  (usually  individuals)  will  then\ncontact  truck  owners  (who  are  again  often  individuals)  or  truck  drivers,  who  often  wait  for\ncargoes  at  truck  parking  lots  or  along  highways.  Truck  parking  lots  are  usually  found  at  the\noutskirts  of  cities,  most  of  them  had  informally  emerged  and  often  are  surrounded  by  small\nbuildings  where  cargo  brokers  are  located.  The  performance  of  the  trucking  industry  is  poor\nbecause of (i) the high proportion of overage vehicles; (ii) lack of backhaul cargoes; and (iii) lack\nof loading/unloading facilities, which does not allow transshipment from larger to smaller trucks,\noften needed at the peripheries of major cities where truck bans are in force.\n\n13.\nThe public and private sectors provide passenger services through road transport. Over\nthe years, the share of the public sector in the total fleet of buses has declined. While in 1980/81\nthe  public  sector  held  45  percent  of  the  total  number  of  buses  in  the  country,  in  1995/96  its\nshare came down to 25 percent.\n\n4.\n\nRevenues/Expenditures and Road Fund\n\n14.\nThe  Central  Government  provides  funds  for  developing  and  maintaining  NHs  from  a\nyearly  budgetary  allocation,  while  the  respective  state  governments  provide  funds  for  state\nhighways,  and  district  and  rural  roads.  Transport  investments  have  accounted  for  about  13\npercent of total public sector spending under the Government\u2019s Seventh (FY1985-FY1990) and\nEighth  (FY1992-FY1997)  Five-Year  Plan  (FYP)  periods.  Expenditure  on  roads  increased  250\npercent  from  Rs63,350  million  under  the  Seventh  FYP  to  Rs160,930  million  under  the  Eighth\nFYP,  although  the  road  sector\u2019s  share  of  total  transport  investment  remained  at  about  22\npercent  under  both  periods.  Under  the  Ninth  FYP  (FY1997-FY2002),  the  transport  budget\nallocation increased by about three times from the Eighth FYP to Rs2,000,000 million, of which\nRs400,000 million (20 percent) is to be spent on roads.\n\n15.\nA  central  road  fund  in  India  has  existed  for  years.  Since  its  source  of  funds  had  been\nvery limited, the Central Government decided to revamp this fund into the Dedicated Road Fund\n(DRF). The major source of this fund is additional excise duties (called \u201ccess\u201d) of Re1 per liter of\npetrol or diesel. The former was introduced in 1998 and the latter in 1999 through the Central\nRoad  Fund  Ordinance.  These  new  sources  of  funds  are  expected  to  bring  Rs60  billion  per\nannum  (equivalent  to  $1.3  billion)  of  funding  to  the  road  sector.  To  institutionalize  DRF,\nParliament  passed  the  Central  Road  Fund  Act  2000  in  November  2000.  According  to  its\nallocation formula and assuming Rs10 billion is raised from petrol and Rs50 billion from diesel,\napproximately Rs25 billion will be allocated for rural roads, Rs20 billion for NHs, Rs10 billion for\nstate highways, and Rs5 billion for railway crossings and other purposes. Unlike a typical road\nfund, which is primarily used for maintenance, DRF will be used mainly for developing the road\nnetwork (Supplementary Appendix B).\n\n\f5. \n\nMaintenance\n\n4\n\n16.\nOver the years, NH network maintenance has not received adequate attention because\nof inadequate fund allocation. In the Ninth FYP, the budget allocation for NH maintenance was\nmore  than  doubled  compared  to  that  in  the  previous  plan  period.  Notwithstanding  this,  the\nmaintenance shortfall, which was up to 48.3 percent in 1993/94, was only reduced to about 43.7\npercent in FY2000.\n\n17.\nNHAI,  which  is  required  to  maintain  NHs  entrusted  to  it,  currently  does  so  through  the\nPublic Works Departments (PWDs) or contracts it out to a private contractor (occasionally NHAI\ndoes  it  by  itself).  The  maintenance  cost  has  been  covered  by  budgetary  support  from  the\nCentral Government. Faced with rapid expansion in the road network entrusted to it, NHAI has\ndecided to explore the possibility of introducing an asset management concept to maintain and\nmanage  its  road  network  more  systematically.  It  commissioned  a  study  under  World  Bank\nfunding  on  the  corridor  management  units  (CMUs).  A  key  element  of  the  CMU  concept  is  to\noperate and maintain the road network through a series of concessions to private contractors.\nA  CMU  is  also  responsible  for  ensuring  the  integrity  of  the  right-of-way  by  maintaining  fences\nand  markers,  taking  necessary  accident  prevention  measures  including  safety  signal  and\nequipment,  removing  obstacles  on  roads,  controlling  emission,  and  keeping  noises  within\nacceptable limits. If  necessary, NHAI  is given authority to introduce traffic management.  With\nthe recent completion of the study, two pilot CMUs will be established under the Third National\nHighway Project of the World Bank.\n\n6. \n\nRoad Safety\n\nThe  number  and  severity  of  road  accidents  in  the  country  have  been  increasing.  The\n18.\n1995 fatality rate (24 fatalities per 10,000 vehicles)2 was double that in 1982. Road fatalities in\n1999  reached  80,000  for  the  country,  with  NHs  accounting  for  34  percent  of  the  total.  Road\nsafety  is  a  serious  concern  in  India  along  all  NHs.  The  sharp  increase  in  the  volume  of  traffic\nand  overloaded  trucks  has  aggravated  the  problem.  Overcrowded  buses  pose  another  safety\nproblem. In New Delhi, public transport is not well regulated; buses account for 2 percent of the\ntraffic volume but are involved in 25 percent of the accidents. Law enforcement is very poor and\nresponsibility  is  divided  among  many  district-level  police  wings.  There  is  no  highway  patrol.\nEducation  for  drivers  and  other  road  users  is  not  effective.  Drivers  of  trucks  and  tractors  lack\nproper  training  in  traffic  rules.  In  many  road  sections,  unauthorized  counterflow  traffic  is\nobserved  along  the  fast  moving  lane,  often  resulting  in  fatal  accidents.  Traffic  signs  and  lane\nmarkings are inadequate.\n\nUnder  ADB  technical  assistance  (TA)3  on  road  safety,  a  system  for  identifying  black\n19.\nspots  on  NHs  was  devised,  and  an  accident  investigation  and  prevention  manual  for  highway\nengineers  was  prepared.  Following  this,  the  Road  Safety  Cell  was  established  in  MORTH  to\ncollect, analyze, and interpret road accident statistics. This initiative is being continued through\nan  ongoing  World  Bank-administered  TA  that  will  (i)  produce  a  comprehensive  road  safety\nmanual  covering  the  planning,  design,  construction,  and  maintenance  aspects;  (ii)  review  the\nIndian Road Congress norms on road safety and recommend improvements; and (iii) draw up\nsafety  guidelines  for  traffic  operations  during  road  construction.  The  Government  is  also\naddressing road safety issues through public information campaigns and road safety education\nprograms conducted by the road safety councils in the respective states.  For the first time, the\nGovernment\u2019s  Ninth  FYP  has  a  dedicated  budget  provision  for  road  safety,  including  specific\n\n                                                          \n2 Fatality  rates  for  Japan,  United  States,  and  Western  Europe  range  between  2  and  6.  Among  ADB\u2019s  developing\nmember countries, the People\u2019s Republic of China\u2019s fatality rate is 49; Malaysia, 7; Pakistan, 33; and Sri Lanka 20.\n\n3 TA 2001-IND: Road Safety, for $210,000, approved on 29 November 1993.\n\n\f5\n\nallocations  for  engineering  improvements,  traffic  control,  wayside  amenities,  and  highway\npatrolling schemes. In 1995, ADB also initiated a regional TA (RETA) on road safety,4 covering\nseveral developing member countries including India. The RETA assessed regional initiatives in\nroad  safety  and  recognized  that  significant  institutional  progress  had  been  made  in  India  with\nthe  inclusion  of  road  safety  as  a  priority  area  for  activity  within  the  New  Delhi  regional\ninfrastructure.\n\n7.\n\nEnvironmental Issues\n\nSince 1991, the Government has gradually intensified its control over gas emission from\n20.\nvehicles.  First-stage control was introduced for petrol-powered vehicles in 1991 and for diesel-\npowered  vehicles \ntougher  standards,\ncorresponding to Euro I requirements for passenger cars and commercial vehicles. Leaded fuel\nhas  been  gradually  phased  out  from  metropolitan  cities  since  1998  with  the  introduction  of\nunleaded  fuel.  From  December  1998,  commercial  vehicles  over  15  years  of  age  have  been\nbanned from Delhi\u2019s center.\n\nin  1992.  The  Government  plans \n\nintroduce \n\nto \n\nADB has been working with the Government to address environmental issues relating to\n21.\nthe  road  sector  such  as  preventing  of  environmental  degradation  during  construction  and\noperation  of  highways,  and  controlling  pollution  due  to  urban  traffic.  An  ADB  TA5  on\nenvironmental management prepared guidelines for highway projects; they are now used on all\nhighway  improvement  and  reconstruction  projects  in  India.  The  guidelines  ensure  that  ADB\u2019s\nenvironmental  standards  are  complied  with.  Under  ADB\u2019s  Second  Road  Project,6  a  study  of\nmeasures to control traffic pollution in urban areas was carried out. Consequently, the Central\nPollution  Control  Board  updated  its  regulations  for  mass  emissions  and  enforced  them  more\nstringently.\n\nB. \n\nGovernment Sector Objectives and Plans\n\nFaced with chronic capacity shortage on major arterial links, the Government decided to\n22.\nundertake  a  radical  program  of  upgrading  key  NH  corridors  called  the  National  Highways\nDevelopment  Program  (NHDP).  A  key  component  of  NHDP  is  upgrading  the  golden\nquadrilateral,  approximately  6,000  km  of  highway  network  connecting  four  major  metropolitan\nareas (Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, and Kolkata) and slated to be completed by the end of 2003.\nAnother component is upgrading the north-south and east-west corridors, 4,000 km and 3,300\nkm, respectively, to be completed by the end of 2007.7 NHDP calls for all of these corridors to\nbe upgraded to a minimum four-lane standard. Once NHDP is implemented, the focus will shift\nto  improving  access  to  major  ports,  the  Port  Connectivity  Project,  then  to  construction  of  a\nnational  expressway  network  and  rehabilitation  of  parts  of  the  NH  network  that  were  not\nincluded in NHDP.\n\n23.\nConstruction  costs  for  NHDP  were  estimated  as  approximately  $13  billion.  To  finance\nthe  program,  NHAI  intends  to  raise  $4.4  billion  through  a  levy  on  petrol  and  diesel  (para.  15),\n$2.7  billion  through  financial  markets,  $1.4  billion  through  private  sector  participation  in  the\nproject, and the remaining $4.4 billion through external assistance. The Government\u2019s strategies\ninclude the revamping the road fund for development, issuing domestic bonds to tap the funds\nfrom  India\u2019s  capital  markets,  engaging  the  private  sector  in  developing  the  road  network,  and\nusing international and bilateral assistance.\n\n                                                          \n4 TA 5620-REG: Regional Initiatives in Road Safety, for $600,000, approved on 4 January 1995.\n5 TA 2002-IND: Environmental Management of Road Projects, for $240,000, approved on 29 November 1993.\n6 Loan 1041-IND: Second Road Project, for $250 million, approved on 30 October 1990.\n7  The original target of 2009 was recently revised to 2007.\n\n\fC. \n\nExternal Assistance to the Sector\n\n6\n\n24.\nSince 1988, ADB has extended four loans totaling $873 million and 22 TAs amounting to\n$8.9 million to the road sector in India. Apart from ADB, the World Bank and the Japan Bank for\nInternational  Cooperation  (JBIC)  are  also  involved  in  the  road  sector.  The  World  Bank  has\nfinanced  nine  projects  amounting  to  about  $1,900  million  to  construct  and  rehabilitate  rural\nroads,  improve  state  highways,  and  widen  NHs  to  four  lanes.  JBIC  has  provided  five  loans\namounting to $263 million equivalent to upgrade sections of NH2 and NH5 to four lanes and to\nconstruct a bridge across the Yamuna River at Allahabad-Naini. The World Bank has a pipeline\nof  projects  at  various  stages  of  processing.  The  projects  include  further  loans  for  the  Delhi-\nKolkata  corridor  as  well  as  loans  for  state  highways  in  a  number  of  states.  The  World  Bank\nintends to process three loans to the transport sector each year. ADB\u2019s assistance to the road\nsector  is  well  coordinated  with  the  World  Bank  and  JBIC  through  regular  consultation\n(Supplementary Appendix C).\n\nD. \n\nLessons Learned\n\nADB\u2019s first loan project8 to improve highways in the states of Andhra Pradesh, Haryana,\n25.\nKarnataka,  Tamil  Nadu,  and  Uttar  Pradesh  was  completed  in  March  1998,  while  the  second\nloan  project  (footnote  6)  to  improve  national  and  state  highways  in  the  states  of  Andhra\nPradesh,  Karnataka,  Kerala,  Orissa,  Rajasthan,  Uttar  Pradesh,  and  West  Bengal  was\ncompleted  in  December  1999.  Both  projects,  which  were  implemented  by  the  respective  state\nPWDs,  experienced  long  delays.  Project  completion  reports  (PCRs)9  for  the  two  projects\nidentified  two  major  reasons:  delay  in  establishing  a  project  implementation  unit  (PIU)  and\nrecruiting construction supervision consultants; and delay in preconstruction activities, such as\nland  acquisition  and  clearance  of  utilities  and  trees  due  to  difficulties  in  obtaining  necessary\nadministrative clearances from relevant authorities. The PCRs recommended taking necessary\nactions  to  redress  these  problems.  To  further  expedite  the  implementation,  the  PCRs  further\nrecommended to (i) reduce the number of contract packages, thus increasing the size of each\ncontract;  (ii)  strengthen  the  contract  management  capability  of  executing  agencies  (EAs);    (iii)\nensure  acceptance  by  EAs  of  the  role  of  the  supervision  consultant  as  the  \u201cEngineer\u201d  in\naccordance with Federation Internationale des Ingenieurs-Conseils (FIDIC) conditions; and (iv)\nuse imprest account, and accord EAs direct access to the imprest account.\n\n26.\nADB\u2019s  third  project  to  improve  NHs  in  the  states  of  Andhra  Pradesh,  Bihar,  Haryana,\nRajasthan, and West Bengal was designed to overcome the problems experienced by the state\nPWDs  in  the  earlier  projects  by  making  a  specially  created  project  unit  within  MORTH  with\nresponsibility  for  project  implementation.  Project  implementation  responsibility  was  to  be\ntransferred  at  a  later  date,  to  NHAI  once  it  became  fully  functional.  The  number  of  civil  works\ncontract  packages  was  reduced  to  five  and  made  sufficiently  large  to  attract  the  more\nexperienced  and  better  capitalized  contractors.  Despite  these  measures,  the  third  project  also\nexperienced  start-up  delays.  For  lack  of  Government  budgetary  allocation,  NHAI  became  fully\nfunctional  only  in  March  1995.  In  addition,  the  award  of  civil  works  contracts  was  delayed\nbecause  of  litigation  by  some  unsuccessful  bidders.  When  the  contracts  were  eventually\nawarded, while the entire project sites were not fully cleared of utilities and trees, NHAI ensured\nthat sufficient work force was available to the contractors to commence work. Setting aside the\nstart-up delays, NHAI implemented the third project well, with disbursements reaching as high\nas  $66  million  in  2000,  an  achievement  unique  for  a  road  project.  Most  of  the  problems\nassociated  with  the  PWDs\u2019  projects  (e.g.,  nonavailability  and/or  diversion  of  funds,  delays  in\n\n                                                          \n8 Loan 918-IND: Road Improvement Project, for $198 million, approved on 10 November 1988.\n9  Report numbers IN.198-99 (Aug.1999) for Loan 918-IND, and IN.266-00 (Nov. 2000) for Loan 1041-IND.\n\n\f7\n\npayments, delays in decision making due to bureaucratic process, lack of coordination among\nvarious agencies) were overcome by entrusting project implementation to NHAI.\n\nFor  the  Surat-Manor  Tollway  Project,10  which  became  effective  in  November  2000,\n27.\ncontracts  have  been  awarded  for  both  civil  works  packages  and  consulting  services  for\nconstruction  supervision.  However,  contract  prices  for  civil  works  have  turned  out  to  be\nsubstantially lower than the estimates. While this is partly due to the strong competition among\nbidders, the overestimation of the project costs appears to be another reason for the difference\nbetween  the  estimated  and  contractual  prices.  The  costs  of  civil  works  were  estimated  on  the\nbasis of the Government\u2019s standard unit prices for construction.\n\n28.\nIn the proposed Project, careful attention has been paid to overcome the shortcomings\nof previous ADB projects through the following implementation arrangements: (i) start-up delays\nwill  be  reduced  by  approving  advance  action  for  procuring  civil  works  contracts  and  recruiting\nsupervision  consultants;  (ii)  the  land  acquisition  process  was  simplified  and  necessary\nadministrative authorities were delegated to designated \u201ccompetent authority\u201d; (iii) the clearance\nof  trees  and  utilities  from  the  right-of-way  will  be  a  condition  for  contract  award;  (iv)  the\nprequalification  criteria  were  tightened  and  the  contract  package  size  made  large  enough  to\nattract  contractors  with  international  experience;  (v)  NHAI  agreed  to  accept  the  role  of  the\nsupervision  consultants  as  Engineer  in  accordance  with  international  best  practice  in  contract\nmanagement; and (vi) the cost estimates were based on recent bid prices offered by contractors\nin  several  NHs  projects,  instead  of  on  Government\u2019s  unit  prices.  In  addition,  ADB  is  providing\nadvisory TA for strengthening NHAI\u2019s capability to manage contracts in accordance with FIDIC\nconditions.11\n\nE.\n\nADB\u2019s Sector Strategy\n\n29.\nIndia is  undertaking  a  huge program of highway upgrading (paras. 22 and 23) that will\ntake  10  years  at  a  total  cost  of  $13  billion.  The  Government  has  requested  ADB  to  provide  a\nseries  of  loans  to  cover  part  of  the  program.  Given  the  potential  scale  of  the  lending,  its\napproach  should  be  programmatic.  Projects  should  be  developed  in  a  sequential  and\nprogressive manner. A long-term strategy of ADB is to create an enabling environment for the\nefficient  and  sustainable  development  of  the  highway  system  so  as  to  meet  the  needs  of  the\npublic for increased mobility and efficient cargo movement. Specific ways of intervening in the\nroad system will differ since each segment faces a different challenge.\n\n30.\nThe  road  system  of  India  can  be  grouped  into  four  segments:  key  NH  links,  other  NH\nsystem, state highways and road, and rural roads. A different agency oversees each segment of\nthe road sector: (i) NHAI, (ii) MORTH, (iii) state PWDs, and (iv) Ministry of Rural Development\n(MORD) (Table 1).\n\n                                                          \n10  Loan 1747-IND: Surat-Manor Tollway Project, for $180 million, approved on 27 July 2000.\n11 TA 3361-IND: Capacity Building for Contract Supervision and Management in the National Highways Authority of\n\nIndia, for $600,000, approved on 22 December 1999.\n\n\f8\n\n0.5\n\n1.5\n\n4.0\n\nCoverage\n(%)\n\nTraffic Carried\n(%)\n\nAgency\n\n25.0\n\nNHAI\n\n15.0\n\nMORTH\n\n45.0\n\n26 State PWDs\n\nSegment\n\nKey national\nHighways (NH)\n\nRest of the\nNH system\n\nState highways\n& roads\n\nRural roads\n\n94.0\n\n15.0\n\nMORD & PWDs\n\nTable 1: The Road System of India\n\nThe  medium-  to  long-term  objectives  of  ADB\u2019s  operations  for  each  segment  of  the\n\n31.\nhighway system can be summarized as follows:\n\n1. \n\nNHAI Segment\n\n(i) \n\nStrengthen  institutional  capacity  for  project  implementation,  highway\noperation  and  maintenance  (O&M),  and  contract  management  while\nmaintaining the size of the organization small.\n\n(ii) \n\nFurther advance the public-private partnership concept.\n\n(iii) \n\nDevelop  more  sophisticated \nfinancial  management  and  planning\ncapability  so  as  to  effectively  mobilize  necessary  funds  from  capital\nmarkets, both domestic and foreign.\n\n(iv) \n\nInstitute a stronger and transparent corporate governance.\n\n(v) \n\nTransform  NHAI  into  a  more  financially  and  managerially  autonomous\nbody that should eventually evolve into a corporatized organization.\n\n2. \n\nMORTH Segment\n\n(i) \n\nSeparate  planning  and  operational \nrelationship between MORTH and PWDs.\n\nfunctions,  and \n\nredefine \n\nthe\n\n(ii) \n\nSecure transparent and equitable management of the road fund.\n\n(iii) \n\nStrengthen financing capability, particularly for maintenance.\n\n(iv) \n\nReorient  MORTH  from  an  infrastructure  developing  to  a  policy  planning\nministry  so  that  it  can  address  more  effectively  policy  issues  such  as\nmodernized  trucking  services,  road  safety,  and  cargo  handling  for\nfacilitating transshipment from long-distance to pick-up trucks.\n\n\f3. \n\nState PWDs12 Segment\n\n9\n\n4. \n\nMORD Segment\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nStrengthen financing capability through a variety of mechanisms including\nstate-level road funds and public-private partnership approach.\n\nReengineer  the  current  institutional  arrangements  for  road  development\nand  maintenance  by  redefining  the  role  of  PWDs,  separating  their\nplanning  and  operational  functions,  and  establishing  road  development\ncorporations.\n\ninteragency \n\nStreamline \ngovernments)  so  as \ndevelopment and maintenance.\n\nrelationship \n\nto  effectively  plan  and \n\n(MORD,  PWDs,  and  district\nimplement  network\n\nIntroduce  a  more  objective  methodology  for  selecting  and  prioritizing  of\nrural road investments.\n\nInstitute  a  systematic  method  of  maintenance  with  adequate  budgetary\nsupport.\n\nUnder  this  programmatic  approach,13  road  sector  operations  will  be  carried  out  as\n\n32.\ndescribed below.

The  dialogue  and  related  TA\nactivities, together with coordinated efforts by the World Bank and other aid agencies, have led\nthe  Government  to  take  a  series  of  bold  policy  actions  aimed  at  establishing  an  enabling\nenvironment for the sustainable development of the NH system in India. The reform actions to\ndate  can  be  grouped  into  four  categories:  (i)  corporate  governance,  (ii)  enhanced  financing\ncapability,  (iii)  improved  project  implementation  capability,  and  (iv)  facilitation  of  private  sector\nparticipation.  The major reform actions by the Government taken to date are listed below.\n\n(i) \n\nStrengthened corporate governance\n\n(a) \n\nSeparating  the  planning  and  operating  functions  of  the  Government  by\nestablishing  a  specialized  agency  in  charge  of  NH  development  and\nmanagement  (NHAI  was  established  in  1988,  became  operational  in\n1995).\n\n\f(ii) \n\nImproved financing capability\n\n(b) \n\n(c) \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\n(c) \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\n(a) \n\n11\n\nDelegating  broader  decision-making  authority  to  NHAI  so  that  it  can\ndecide  on  individual  investment  and  procurement  without  going  through\nthe  lengthy  process  of  obtaining  approval  from  the  Public  Investment\nBoard  (PIB).  This  delegation  of  authority  was  made  possible  by\nincreasing NHAI\u2019s board members to include the members of PIB such as\nsecretaries  of  the  Ministry  of  Finance  (MOF),  MORTH,  and  Planning\nCommission [2000].\n\nAuthorizing the NHAI chairman to recruit its staff, both management and\nprofessional,  without  going  through  the  usual  recruitment  process  of\ngovernment officers [1997].\n\nRevamping  existing  current  road  fund  by  introducing  an  excise  duty\n(called \u201ccess\u201d) levied on petrol and diesel, which is expected to generate\nRs60 billion ($1.3 billion) per annum for the road sector [1998 and 1999].\n\nApproving NHAI\u2019s issuance of bonds to raise funds from domestic capital\nmarkets. Issuance was facilitated by exempting purchasers of the bonds\nfrom the capital gains tax [2000].\n\nAdopting the policy that, once a road is upgraded to a four-lane highway,\nthe  NH  could  charge  toll,  paving  the  way  to  future  recovery  of  the\nconstruction cost of the NH system [1997].\n\nSimplifying  the  century-old  land  acquisition  procedure  by  amending  the\nNational  Highway  Act.  Under  this  process,  land  acquisition  will  be\nsignificantly  expedited  and  can  be  completed  within  a  predictable  period\nof time.\n\nStrengthening  NHAI\u2019s  capacity  for  dealing  with  environmental  and  social\nissues. A general manager in charge of environmental issues has already\nbeen  assigned.  In  addition,  ADB  is  providing  TA  to  NHAI  to  establish  a\nseparate unit for resettlement and social development within NHAI.14\n\nIssuing  and  implementing  a  policy  statement,  \u201cGuideline  for  Private\nSector  Participation  in  the  Road  Infrastructure\u201d  [1997].  The  guideline\nincludes a number of critical policy actions to facilitate the build-operate-\ntransfer  (BOT)  scheme,  including  (i)  tax  exemption  accorded  to  BOT\ninvestors  (100  percent  income  tax  exemption  for  the  first  five  years  and\n30  percent  exemption \nfive  years);  (ii)  government\nthe  next \ncommitment  in  all  preparative  actions  including  land  acquisition,  right-of-\nway  clearance,  and  utilities  removal;  (iii)  NHAI\u2019s  provision  of  a  minimum\namount of capital grant, in case that is needed to get a adequate numbers\nof contractors to bid for a project; (iv) foreign direct investments with up to\n\nfor \n\n(iii)\n\nEnhanced project implementation capacity\n\n(iv)\n\nIncreased private sector participation\n\n                                                          \n14 TA 3365-IND: Capacity Building for Social Development, for $800,000, approved on 23 December 1999.\n\n\f12\n\n100 percent equity participation; and (v) duty-free import of modern high-\nperformance construction equipment.\n\n(b) \n\nAmending the National Highway Act, authorizing private sector investors\nto  operate  a  part  of  the  NH  system  and  collect  tolls  under  the\nGovernment\u2019s concession scheme [1997].\n\n34.\nAs  seen  above,  significant  progress  has  been  made  on  major  policy  and  institutional\nfronts, but a number of areas remain to be addressed. They include (i) establishing a medium-\nto  long-term  goal  for  NHAI,  (ii)  instituting  more  efficient  highway  maintenance  systems,  (iii)\nenhancing of the financing capability of NHAI, (iv) enhancing road safety, and (v) modernizing\nroad freight services.\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nEstablishment  of  a  clear  medium-  to  long-term  strategic  framework  for  NHAI.\nNHAI  is  still  in  a  transitional  stage.  Starting  with  a  dozen  staff  and  a  capital  of\nRs7 billion in 1995, it has grown into an organization with 350 staff handling more\nthan  Rs60  billion  per  year.  Its  operations  are  expected  to  further  expand  and\nbecome  more  complicated  due  to  the  introduction  of  alternative  financing\nmechanisms and the increased participation of the private sector.  Despite these\nchanges,  its  basic  way  of  doing  business  is  still  essentially  based  on  the\ntraditional  \u201cagency  system\u201d  that  had  primarily  been  developed  decades  ago  for\nentrusting civil works of the Central Government to state PWDs. NHAI receives\nproject  management  fees  (3  percent  of  the  costs  of  the  externally  assisted\nprojects,  and  9  percent  for  other  projects)  in  return  for  its  execution  of  the\nentrusted civil works. Beside this, NHAI does not have its own source of revenue.\nIt  does  not  retain  the  tolls  it  collects,  which  are  to  be  deposited  to  the\nconsolidated  account  of  the  Central  Government  (highways  are  not  NHAI\u2019s\nassets). This arrangement not only gives little incentive to NHAI for cost-effective\nhighway construction, but also makes it difficult for NHAI to transform itself into a\nmore independent entity that could mobilize the funds from the capital markets in\na  more  sustainable  and  cost-effective  manner.  Entering  into  the  new  phase  of\nevolution, NHAI should set out a medium- to long-term vision of its eventual goal.\nThe proposed Project has incorporated a component designed to facilitate policy\ndialogue with the Government on the most appropriate form of the organization,\nand how NHAI is to be transformed into that new form.\n\nInstituting more efficient highway operation and maintenance systems. This is a\nrelatively new area to NHAI. With increased highway assets available for service,\nO&M  are  becoming  an  increasingly  important  area.  Given  the  limited  human\nresources  in  NHAI,  the  most  effective  way  of  carrying  out  this  function  is\ncontracting it out to the private sector. The previously approved Loan 1747-IND\n(footnote  10)  has  incorporated  this  concept.  The  proposed  Project  is  to  further\nadvance  this  approach  by  incorporating  an  asset  management  concept  (i.e.,\nCMU) as detailed in para. 17.\n\nEnhancing the financing capability of NHAI. Recently NHAI decided to involve the\nprivate sector in BOT schemes, but many of these will be viable only if a grant or\nannuity  is  offered  to  the  private  sector.15  NHAI  has  also  raised  funds  from  the\ncapital  markets  through  bond  issues  made  possible  only  by  exempting  the\npurchasers from the capital gains tax. This tax exemption status is less likely to\nbe  repeated  in  subsequent  bond  issues.  Given  the  envisaged  scale  of  fund\n\n                                                          \n15 Bridge or bypass or short section developments were made without offering grants and annuities.\n\n\f(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n13\n\nmobilization through capital markets and also from the private sector, NHAI has\nto further strengthen its financing capability and diversify its financing schemes.\nThe proposed Project will assist NHAI with diversified and sophisticated financing\ninstruments including securitization of future revenue flow.\n\nAdvancing  public-private  partnership  (PPP).  Given  the  multi-purpose  nature  of\nNH systems in India, which entail both public and private goods elements, they\nshould be developed through the participation of the public and private sectors.\nIn this PPP approach, the Government does not pay more than the public goods\ncomponent. The current arrangement that the Government adopted for the BOT\nhighway  projects  presents  an  effective  mechanism  since  bidders  for  a  BOT\nproject  compete  with  each  other  for  the  amount  of  the  grant  (either  positive  or\nnegative),  and  the  results  of  bidding  will  be  a  good  indication  of  the  optimum\nbalance  of  the  public  and  private  goods  elements.  It  was,  therefore,  agreed  to\nreview the experience of the BOT operations during the Project midterm review\ncurrently scheduled for May 2003.\n\nEnhancing road safety. India has one of the highest traffic accident rates in Asia\ndue  to  a  number  of  factors,  including  inadequate  enforcement  of  safety\nregulations, ineffective vehicle inspection system, and inadequate safety training.\nThe most serious factor is the mixture of fast-moving and slow-moving traffic and\nuncontrolled pedestrian crossing. The proposed Project will address this problem\nby establishing a continual median to prevent counterflow traffic, separating fast\nand  slow \nto  enable\ntraffic,  and  providing  underpasses  and  overpasses \npedestrians to cross roads.\n\n.\n(vi)  Modernizing  road  freight  services.  The  upgraded  NH  system  is  designed  for  an\noperating speed of 100 km per hour. However, trucks currently run at a speed of\n40-50  km,  particularly  when  carrying  heavy-duty  cargoes  such  as  containers.\nUnless  trucking  services  are  modernized,  the  full  benefits  of  the  upgraded\nhighway  network  will  not  be  realized.  A  policy  for  the  modernization  of  the\ntrucking  services,  particularly \nintermodal  operation,  should  be\ndeveloped and implemented. ADB and MORTH agreed to address this issue in\nfuture ADB activities.\n\nthose \n\nfor \n\nThese  policy  and  institutional  issues  will  be  addressed  in  close  cooperation  with  the\n\n35.\nWorld Bank as has been done in the last several years.\n\nIV.\n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT\n\nA.\n\nRationale\n\nfrom \n\nlack  of \n\nIndia\u2019s  highway  sector  has \n\n36.\nfunding,  weak  project\nlong  suffered \nimplementation  capability,  poor  policy  coordination,  and  delays  in  decision  making.  Launching\nan  unprecedented  scale  of  a  national  highway  development,  the  Government  decided  to\naddress these decade-old institutional problems and issues. The Government has already taken\nactions  to  boost  the  source  of  funds  for  highway  development  and  facilitate  private  sector\nparticipation  in  highway  development  and  maintenance  to  fill  up  some  of  the  financing  gap\nneeded for NHDP development. While these actions have significantly contributed to resolving\nthe  problems,  even  more  fundamental  challenges  remain.  They  include  introducing  more\nsophisticated  financial  instruments,  diversifying  methods  involving  the  private  sector,  and\nenhancing  the  financial  and  managerial  autonomy  of  NHAI  with  the  eventual  goal  of\ncorporatization.  These  challenges  cannot  be  met  by  a  one-time  intervention;  they  require\n\n\f14\n\nconsistent  and  repeated  interventions.  ADB  envisages  launching  a  new  initiative  to  address\nthese  issues  from  a  longer  term  perspective  by  undertaking  a  sequential  and  progressive\napproach for future lending in this subsector.\n\n37.\nAside  from  the  longer  term  challenges,  the  Government  is  facing  the  immediate\nchallenge  of  upgrading  key  arterial  corridors,  particularly  the  golden  quadrilateral  (GQ).  The\nwestern transport corridor (WTC) is the busiest part of the GQ, passing through Delhi, Haryana,\nRajasthan, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Tamil Nadu states. Constructing an efficient,\ncontinuous  transport  linkage  throughout  the  WTC  will  have  a  significant  impact  on  overall\neconomic growth and also allow benefits from recent economic growth to spread to the poorer\nareas.  The  Surat-Manor  Tollway  Project  (footnote  10)  was  the  first  loan  ADB  has  provided  to\nassist the upgrading of GQ. The proposed Project is the second in the series of assistance for\nupgrading GQ.\n\n38.\nGiven the higher traffic volume in the WTC than in other parts of the GQ, the WTC was\nchosen  to  experiment  a  concept  of  public-private  partnership.  A  development  strategy  was\ndeveloped  under  ADB\u2019s  Project  Preparatory  TA.16  The  WTC  development  plan  identified  that\napproximately  24  percent  of  the  sections  of  WTC  were  viable  as  projects  using  private  sector\nfunding of some form. The remaining 76 percent not found viable for private sector funding need\npublic  sector  funding  (Appendix  3).  Two  sections  were  identified  as  pilot  projects:  (i)  Jaipur\nbypass  project  using  PPP  funds,  and  (ii)  Tumkur-Haveri  project  using  public  sector  financing.\nFor  the  Jaipur  bypass  project,  ADB  provided  TA  to  enable  NHAI  to  proceed  with  a  PPP\napproach,\n\n39.\nFor the publicly funded portion, ADB proposes to extend financial assistance to upgrade\nthe Tumkur-Haveri section of NH4. This Project was designed to incorporate a number of road\nsafety  features  such  as  median  separation,  service  roads,  bypass,  underpasses,  overpasses,\nand fencing. These features are unprecedented elsewhere on the GQ to date and will act as a\nmodel for safety awareness in designs of similar highways in India\u2019s highway sector.\n\nB. \n\nObjectives and Scope\n\n40.\nThe Project aims to advance policy reforms in India to create an enabling environment\nfor  the  sustainable  development  of  NH  systems  with  substantial  participation  of  the  private\nsector.  The  policy  framework  (Appendix  4),  together  with  a  time-bound  action  plan,  was\ndeveloped and agreed upon with the Government. It will serve as a road map for future lending\noperations to the NH subsector in India (para. 32).\n\n41.\nUnder  this  overall  framework,  the  proposed  Project  was  designed  to  achieve  four\nspecific objectives: (i) remove capacity constraints on a critical section of the Project highway;\n(ii)  enhance  road  safety  by  introducing  design  features  that  will  reduce  traffic  accidents  and\nminimize  negative  impacts  of  road  construction  for  people  within  the  Project  highway;  (iii)\nenhance corporate finance capability of NHAI to facilitate its eventual transition to an efficiently\nmanaged autonomous entity, including possible corporatization; and (iv) increase private sector\nparticipation in the development and O&M of the NH systems.\n\n                                                          \n16  TA  2986-IND:  Western Transport Corridor \u2013 Facilitating Private Participation,  for  $1  million,  approved  on  9\n\nFebruary 1998.\n\n\f15\n\nTo realize the specific objectives, the Project includes investment, capacity-building, and\n\n42.\nproject implementation support components. The investment components will\n\n(i) \n\nupgrade  the  existing  two-lane  single-carriageway  highway  to  a  four-lane  divided\nhighway in the Tumkur-Haveri section of about 259 km on NH4;17 and\n\n(ii)  enhance  road  safety  by \n\nincorporating  several  design \n\nfeatures:  a  divided\ncarriageway  designed  to  prevent  head-on  collisions,  service  roads  to  separate\nslow-moving  and  fast-moving  traffic,  enlarged  cross-culverts  to  facilitate  road\ncrossing  of  pedestrians  and  farm  traffic,  overbridges  for  the  same  purpose,\nbypasses to separate through traffic from locally originated and destined traffic, and\nfences  to  prevent  unlawful  crossing  and  minimize  noise  pollution  in  populated\nareas.\n\nThe capacity building components will\n\n(i) \n\nenhance  the  corporate  finance  capability  of  NHAI  by  (a)  facilitating  capital\nmobilization  by  securitizing  future  revenue  and  issuing  bonds;  (b)  enhancing  the\ntreasury function so as to maximize the yield to be raised from the available funds;\n(c)  improving  the  financial  reporting  system  so  that  potential  investors  can  make\nwell-informed  decisions;  and  (d)  facilitating  the  transition  of  NHAI  into  a  more\nefficiently  managed  autonomous  body  such  as  a  corporatized  organization,  by\ncomparing the relative merits of existing and alternative forms of organizations and\ndeveloping  a strategy for transforming the NHAI;\n\n(ii)  commercialize  O&M  for  the  Project  section  of  NH4  by  offering  the  O&M  functions\nas  concession  to  the  private  sector  together  with  consulting  services  for  (a)\ndeveloping  O&M  tender  documents  for  a  private  concessionaire,  specifically\ndesigned  for  the  Tumkur-Haveri  section  in  line  with  the  corridor  management  unit\nconcept;  and    (b)  providing  assistance  in  bid  evaluation  and  negotiation  with  a\nsuccessful bidder;\n\n(iii)  conduct  safety  audit \nimplementation; and\n\nto \n\nlearn \n\nfrom  experience  during  construction  and\n\n(iv)  establish a more rationally structured tolling system and increase public acceptance\n\nof tolls through effective public campaigns.\n\nThe  last  three  activities  are  being  funded  under  the  ongoing  Surat-Manor  Tollway\nProject (footnote 10) (see para. 68).\n\nThe project implementation support components will\n\n(i) \n\nprovide construction supervision services for the investment components; and\n\n(ii)  provide  environmental  impact  management  training  to  staff  of  NHAI,  contractors,\n\nand supervision consultants.\n\n                                                          \n17 Project road is between Km 75 (Tumkur) and Km 340 (Haveri) with exclusion of a bypass to Sira Town between\n\nKm 116 and Km 122.\n\n\f1.\n\nInvestment Components\n\n16\n\n43.\nUpgrading Highways.  The Project will rehabilitate the existing highway and widen the\nentire section to a four-lane divided highway. Of the total project length of 259 km, 18.3 km will\nbe a new four-lane divided highway to avoid congested urban areas and to minimize the impact\non  property  and  buildings,  2.7  km  will  be  a  new  four-lane  divided  highway  to  realign  a  short\nlength of highway with substandard geometry, and 5.5 km will be a two-lane single carriageway\nto  relieve  the  existing  Hariyur  bypass.  The  design  speed  will  be  100  km/hour,  but  a  reduced\ndesign speed of 80 km/hr will be adopted for the Harihar and Chitradurga bypasses due to right-\nof-way  constraints.  Traffic  loading  for  pavement  design  was  derived  from  traffic  projections\ngenerated during the economic analysis of the project together with field investigation work. In a\nsignificant departure from the usual Indian practice, the existing pavement will not be retained\nbut will be milled off and reused in the lower layers of new pavement construction. This change\nis  justified  after  evidence  from  previous  NHAI  projects  raised  questions  as  to  the  integrity  of\nstructural  overlays  on  old  pavements  that  have  a  complex  history  of  widening  and  overlaying.\nPavement designs for both reconstructed and new pavements were based on a 15-year life.\n\nEnhancing  Road  Safety.  The  design  of  the  upgrading  works  contains  a  number  of\n44.\nelements  that  are  novel  in  Indian  highway  construction.  During  the  design  stage,  a  significant\neffort was made to incorporate features that will (i) enhance safety for the user, and (ii) minimize\ndisruption to communities through which the highway passes. Examples of the safety features\nare the adoption of limited access, in which traffic can only join the highway at interchanges via\n21 grade separated interchanges at major junctions and 13 at-grade junctions for minor roads;\nfencing to control pedestrian access; and service roads to separate local traffic from high-speed,\nlong-distance traffic. Major highways can become an impenetrable barrier to local communities\nthrough  which  the  highway  passes.  To  mitigate  the  inconvenience  to  local  people  and  allow\npassage of agricultural vehicles and animals, overpasses and underpasses will be provided at\n63 locations. The overpasses and underpasses will not be connected to the main highway and\nthus will allow safe passage of local traffic without introducing conflict with the high-speed, long-\ndistance  traffic.  Where  minor  local  roads  run  up  to  the  main  highway,  service  roads  will  lead\nlocal  traffic  to  one  of  the  major  interchanges  or  junctions.  As  individual  features,  none  of  the\npreceding are completely new to India, but the extent and number that have been incorporated\nin this Project are unprecedented.\n\n2.\n\nCapacity-Building Components\n\n45.\nEnhancing  Corporate  Finance  Capability.  To  maximize  the  value  of  the  revamped\nroad  fund,  the  Government  recently  decided  that  it  will  use  the  fund  not  only  for  paying  the\nconstruction costs but also for serving debts incurred or to be incurred by bond issues. This will\nenable NHAI to raise approximately six times more funds from markets with the use of the same\namount of the cess money, but this will also require NHAI to mobilize funds from capital markets\nin  a  more  aggressive  manner  (i.e.,  larger  scale  and  better  term).  To  do  that,  NHAI  must  be\nequipped  with  more  sophisticated  financial  management  and  planning  capabilities,  particularly\nthose for bond issues.\n\n46.\nNHAI  has  already  started  this  process  by  issuing  seven-year  domestic  bonds  with  a\nput/call  option  after  three  years.  The  first  issue  in  2000  raised  Rs5  billion  ($111  million).  The\nsecond  bonds  were  issued  in  February  2001  as  an  on-tap  issue.  Both  issues  carry  a  triple  A\nrating  by  virtue  of  their  implicit  government  guarantee.  There  are  plans  to  raise  approximately\nRs120  billion  ($2.5  billion)  through  a  series  of  bond  issues,  but  this  is  likely  to  exceed  the\nabsorptive  capacity  of  the  domestic  bond  markets  and  will  crowd  out  other  institutions  from\nIndian  bond  markets.  Unless  NHAI  mobilizes  funds  from  foreign  capital  markets,  the  current\nfinancing strategy will not be sustainable. Although NHAI has not yet considered issuing bonds\n\n\f17\n\nin foreign capital markets, it has to take a serious look at this possibility. That undertaking will\nrequire NHAI to disclose more financial information to the public so that potential investors can\nmake better informed decisions.\n\n47.\nAlthough this direct borrowing will bring a significant amount of funds to NHAI, these will\nnot be sufficient to implement the huge tasks mandated by the Government. It will be necessary\nfor  NHAI  to  develop  alternative  financial  instruments.  Beside  the  usual  BOT  schemes  (which\nNHAI  has  already  been  pursuing),  securitizing  the  future  toll  revenue  is  also  to  be  explored.\nNHAI  has  already  established  several  special-purpose  vehicles  (SPVs)  for  the  construction  of\nhighway links connecting to major traffic generators such as ports. It plans to sell its shares in\nthese companies once SPVs demonstrate their revenue-generating capability. Initial public offer\nof these stocks should be made under an overall strategic plan.\n\nThese  changes  call  for  NHAI  to  be  equipped  with  sophisticated  financial  instruments.\n48.\nThe  current  form  of  the  organization  (an  operational  arm  of  the  Government  specializing  in\nhighway  development  and  maintenance)  will  not  necessarily  be  best  for  this  purpose.  NHAI\nshould  begin  to  examine  an  alternative  form  of  organization  from  a  more  strategic  and  longer\nterm  perspective.  Policy  dialogue  should  be  initiated  with  the  aim  of  forming  a  consensus\namong key stakeholders on the future direction of NHAI.\n\nAs a tool to carry out policy dialogue with the Government, TA is proposed to enhance\n\n49.\nthe corporate finance capability of NHAI. The proposed TA will be carried out in two stages.\n\n50.\nThe first stage activities are designed to meet NHAI\u2019s immediate need to strengthen its\ncapacity  in  the  area  of  finance.  More  specifically,  they  will  consist  of  support  for  (i)  capital\nmobilization, (ii) the treasury function, and (iii) a financial reporting system.\n\n(i)  Support for capital mobilization will enable NHAI to develop a general strategy for\nfinancing  road  investments  and  evaluating  alternative  financial  instruments  both\ncurrently  available  and  realizable  in  the  medium  term.  The  financial  instruments\nthat NHAI currently considers are special-purpose vehicles (SPV), bond financing,\nand  other  forms  of  securitization.  The  relative  costs  for  these  instruments  will  be\ndetermined  and  the  potential  size  of  the  market  for  them  estimated.  Also  the\navailable  mechanisms  for  credit  enhancement  will  be  explored  including  different\nforms  of  third-party  guarantees.  Criteria  and  analytical  procedures  for  matching\nroad  projects  and  financing  options  will  be  developed  considering  explicit\nobjectives.  Specific  implementation  plans  will  be  developed  for  each  specific\nopportunity, together with the timetable for implementation.\n\n(ii)  Support for the treasury function aims to strengthen that function. Current practices\nin collecting tolls, revenues, and payments for construction, service contracts, and\ndebt  service  will  be  reviewed  to  ensure  reliability  in  meeting  obligations.  This\ncomponent will also develop a strategy for funds placement to maximize yield while\nensuring  adequate  liquidity.  Performance  measures  will  be  developed  to  monitor\nthe effectiveness of funds placement. A financial planning model will be developed\nin  which  alternative  investment  options  will  be  evaluated  along  with  the  projected\ncash flows related to construction activities, debt service, Government grants, cess\nrevenues,  and  operating  revenues  and  expenditures.  The  model  will  be  used  to\nevaluate allocation of funds in terms of liquidity and return.\n\n(iii)  Support  for  financial  reporting  will  enable  NHAI  to  restructure  its  financial  and\naccounting reporting system to provide the information required to reinforce efforts\nto  raise  financing  in  the  capital  markets,  both  domestically  and  internationally.\n\n\f18\n\nAccounting  policies  and  standards  should  evolve  as  the  financing  operations  of\nNHAI  become  sophisticated.  Thus,  the  consultant  must  develop  a  series  of\nrecommendations  to  enable  NHAI  to  shift  from  current  accounting  practices  to\nthose consistent with Generally Accepted Accounting Practices of India (GAAP-I),\nand,  then,  to  international  accounting  standards  (IAS)  (para.  71  gives  a  more\ndetailed  discussion  of  NHAI\u2019s  accounting  policies  and  practices).  Transition  from\nthe  traditional  accounting  system  to  those  more  commercially  oriented  ones\nrequires  extensive  capacity  building  exercises  for  NHAI  staff.  Consultants  will\nprovide the necessary training.\n\n51.\nThe  above  activities  will  be  preceded  by  a  review  of  the  current  legal  framework\nassociated with ownership of NHs (including the difference between entrusted, vested, leased,\nor owned. The activities will be supplemented by training for NHAI\u2019s staff in financial modeling\nexercises,  and  regional  study  tours  to  countries  such  as  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  that\nhave introduced different models of securitization and raising of funds from the capital markets.\n\n52.\nThe  second-stage  activities  will  focus  on  policy  dialogues  on  the  broader  and  longer\nterm issues with the active participation of relevant Government ministries and the World Bank.\nA  major  topic  will  be  the  future  form  of  the  organization,  with  emphasis  on  how  to  transform\nNHAI into a financially and managerially autonomous body such as a corporatized organization.\nThe main activities follow:\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nreview the results/progress of the World Bank study on institutional development;\n\nreview  the  experiences  of  other  countries  with  regard  to  forms  of  organizations\nthat provide infrastructure through the public sector operating arm;\n\nselect possible alternative forms of organization and apply the strategic financial\nplanning model to compare the existing and alternative forms in terms of financial\nperformance;\n\ndevelop  a  strategy  for  transforming  NHAI  into  an  efficiently  managed  and\nfinancially/managerially autonomous body; and\n\nhold a series of  workshops on the future form of NHAI, with the participation of\nrelevant agencies and the World Bank .\n\nThe activities wIll be carried out in coordination with the World Bank, which is currently\n53.\nassisting  NHAI  in  institutional  strengthening  within  the  existing  framework  of  the  organization.\nThe  ADB  proposal  will  be  carried  out  under  a  TA  to  be  processed  in  conjunction  with  the\nProject.\n\n54.\nCommercializing  O&M.  The  commercialization  concept  was  originally  incorporated  in\nthe Surat-Manor Project, which is expected to be completed in 2003. During processing of the\nWTC Project, it was decided to make this concept consistent with the corridor management unit\napproach,  which  was  developed  and  will  be  tested  under  the  World  Bank-financed  Third\nNational  Highway  Project.  It  was  further  decided  to  engage  one  consulting  firm  for  both  the\nSurat Manor Project and the WTC Project to ensure the consistency of concession agreements\nin both projects. An outline paper for O&M concession (Supplementary Appendix D) has been\nprepared  for  the  consulting  services  that  will  develop  O&M  tender  documents  for  a  private\nsector  concessionaire  including  a  concession  agreement,  and  assist  in  bid  evaluation  and\nnegotiation with a successful bidder.\n\n\f19\n\n55.\nConducting Safety Audit.  At various stages of the Project, a safety audit will be carried\nout to learn from experiences during construction and implementation. Lessons learned will be\napplied to future construction and improvement along the WTC (Supplementary Appendix E).\n\n56.\nToll System Study. As the national highway network expands, an increasing number of\ntollbooths  will  be  established  along  the  highways  to  be  managed  by  NHAI.  To  date,  however,\nthe  locations  of  tollbooths  have  been  determined  in  a  rather  adhoc  manner.  As  a  results,\nhighway  users  feel  frustrated  because  of  the  lack  of  conceptually  acceptable  tolling  systems.\nThe  basic  regime  of  the  current  tolls  was  set  based  on  a  willingness-to-pay  survey,  but  the\ncurrent  level  of  tolls  does  not  necessarily  reflect  that  basis.  They  are  too  low  to  generate  the\nlevel of funds necessary for the continuous development of the national highway system. Thus,\na  rationally  structured  toll  system  needs  to  be  instituted.  Alternative  pricing  strategies  should\nalso be developed. The proposed study will address those issues. Another important element of\nthe tolling system is the perception of tolls by the public that is not yet used to the concept of\npaying for the use of highways. Public campaigns aimed at increased acceptance of tolls will be\na  strategic  action  to  take  for  successful  tolling  operations  for  the  national  highway  system.  A\npublic  campaign  strategy  will  be  developed  and  implemented  through  this  TA  with  use  of\nexperts of extensive knowledge and experience in public campaigning. The summary terms of\nreference (TOR) is in Supplementary Appendix F.\n\n3. \n\nProject Implementation Support Components\n\n57.\nConstruction Supervision. To enhance the efficiency and quality of construction works,\ntwo consulting firms will be engaged to supervise the construction of the project road (the TOR\nis in Supplementary Appendix G). The consultants will undertake the role of engineer as set out\nin  the  FIDIC  conditions  of  contract,  as  would  normally  be  the  case  for  a  major  internationally\nfunded project.\n\n58.\nEnvironmental  Management  Training.  To  strengthen  the  capacity  for  environmental\nmanagement, NHAI will receive funds for training in environmental management. Trainees will\nbe contractors, supervision consultants, and NHAI environment officers in charge of this Project\nand the Surat-Manor Project (Supplementary Appendix H).\n\nC.\n\nCost Estimates\n\n59.\nThe  total  cost  of  the  Project  is  estimated  at  $378.0  million  equivalent,  including\nallowances  for  contingencies  and  interest  during  construction.  The  foreign  exchange  cost  is\nestimated at $240.0 million, representing 63.5 percent of the total cost, while the local currency\ncost is estimated at $138.0 million equivalent, representing 36.5 percent (Table 2 and Appendix\n5).\n\n\f20\n\nTable 2: Project Cost Estimates\n($ million)\n\nItem\n\nA.

The  loan  will  have  a  25-year  term,  including  a\ngrace  period  of  5  years,  an  interest  rate  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based\nlending facility, a commitment charge of 0.75 percent per annum, a front-end fee of 1.0 percent\n(the front-end fee will be capitalized in the loan), conversions options that may be exercised in\naccordance  with  the  terms  of  the  draft  Loan  Agreement,  the  Loan  Regulations,  and  ADB\u2019s\nConversion  Guidelines,  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  set  forth  in  the  draft  Loan\nAgreement.  The  Government  has  provided  ADB  with  (i)  the  reasons  for  the  Government\u2019s\ndecision  to borrow under ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based lending facility on the basis of these terms and\nconditions, and (ii) an undertaking that these choices were the Government\u2019s own independent\ndecision  and  not  made  in  reliance  on  any  communication  or  advice  of  ADB.  The  remaining\nproject  cost  of  $138.0  million  equivalent  in  local  currency  costs  will  be  covered  by  the\nGovernment (Table 3). The proceeds of the loan will be made available by the Government to\nNHAI promptly as required for the purposes of the Project. The Government\u2019s current policy of\nassistance to NHAI in this regard is a loan-grant ration of 20:80. The Government will bear the\nforeign exchange risk of the loan.\n\nTable 3: Financing Plan\n($ million)\n\nSource\n\nAsian Development Bank\nGovernment\n\nTotal\n\nForeign\nCurrency\n\nLocal\nCurrency\n\n240.0\n-\n\n240.0\n\n-\n138.0\n\n138.0\n\nTotal\nCost\n\n240.0\n138.0\n\n378.0\n\nPercentage\n\n63.5\n36.5\n\n100.0\n\n\fE.\n\nImplementation Arrangements\n\n1. \n\nProject Management\n\n21\n\n61.\nNHAI will be the Executing Agency for the Project. The Project will be implemented by a\nspecially created project implementation unit (PIU), which will be located in Chitradugra, a town\nbetween Tumkur and Haveri. A general manager level staff will be assigned as project director,\nassisted  by  five  deputy  general  managers  or  managers,  each  responsible  for  one  contract\npackage.  The  activities  of  the  PIU  will  be  overseen  by  the  chairperson  of  NHAI  who  will  be\nassisted  by  a  chief  general  manager  in  charge  of  NH4  development.  Sufficient  administrative\nauthority  will  be  delegated  to  the  PIU  for  effective  and  timely  decision  making  on  project\nimplementation matters.  Appendix 6 gives the organization structure of PIU.\n\nGiven  the  length  of  Project  roads,  NHAI  decided  to  engage  two  consulting  firms  to\n62.\nensure  adequate  construction  supervision.  One  firm  will  look  after  three  contracts  located\nbetween Tumkur and Chirtradugra, and, the other firm two contracts between Chitradugra and\nHaveri. The two consulting firms will act as Engineers for the Project. It was agreed with NHAI to\nsignificantly  expand  the  power  of  the  \u201cEngineer\u201d  so  as  to  ensure  a  more  objective  and\ntransparent processing of contract variations.\n\n2. \n\nImplementation Schedule\n\n63.\nThe  Project  will  be  implemented  over  48  months,  inclusive  of  procurement  and\npreconstruction  activities  (Supplementary  Appendix  I).  It  is  expected  to  be  completed  by  30\nJune  2005.  The  schedule  will  allow  for  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  activities  and  the\nclearance  of  all  utilities,  trees,  and  any  other  obstructions  from  the  land  to  be  used  for\nconstruction activities.\n\n3. \n\nProcurement\n\nCivil  works  will  be  procured  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines for Procurement,\n64.\nfollowing  international  competitive  bidding  procedures.  ADB  has  approved  NHAI\u2019s  request  to\ndivide civil works into five packages. The contract packages are large enough to attract capable\ncontractors with international experience (the packages range from $27 million to $84 million). It\nwas also agreed that NHAI will not award any civil works contract until (i) the land and rights to\nland  required  for  the  Project  have  been  acquired;  and  (ii)  utilities,  trees,  and  any  other\nobstruction from the land to be used for construction activities relating to the contract have been\ncleared.  The contract packages and the mode of procurement are in Appendix 7.\n\n65.\nTo  expedite  the  process,  ADB  approved  advance  procurement  action  on  9  November\n2000 for prequalification, and on 3 January 2001 for subsequent procurement actions except for\nthe signing of contracts. Based on these actions, prequalification documents were approved on\n24 November 2000, and bidding documents on 9 April 2001. NHAI was advised that approval of\nadvance procurement does not commit ADB to finance the Project.\n\n4. \n\nConsulting Services\n\n66.\nConsulting  services  will  be  required  for  (i)  construction  supervision,  (ii)  training  for\nenvironmental  management,  (iii)  award  of  O&M  services  to  concessionaires,  (iv)  toll  system\nstudy, and (v) safety audit. Consultants for these services will be engaged in accordance with\nADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for\nengagement of domestic consultants.\n\n\f22\n\n67.\nFor  construction  supervision,  two  teams  of  consultants,  comprising  both  international\nand domestic experts will be engaged. Staffing inputs will be 2,630 person-months (around 480\nfor international and 2,150 for domestic) with an estimated cost of approximately $14.0 million.\nOn 3 January 2001 ADB approved advance action for engaging these construction supervision\nconsultants  on  the  understanding  that  such  approval  does  not  commit  ADB  to  finance  the\nProject.  Invitation  documents  for  construction  supervision  consultants  were  approved  on  11\nJune  2001.  For  environmental  management  training,  one  international  and  three  domestic\nconsultants will be engaged. The estimated cost of this activity is $40,000. NHAI will send the\nTOR for consulting services to ADB for approval.\n\n68.\nFor  the  consulting  services  for  (i)  award  of  O&M  operations  to  concessionaires,  (ii)\nsafety  audit,  and  (iii)  toll  collection  system  study,  loan  proceeds  of  the  Surat-Manor  Project\n(Loan  1747-IND)  (footnote  10)  will  be  used  since  these  activities  were  originally  included  in\nLoan 1747-IND, but need to be implemented with a broader scope. NHAI will submit the TOR\nfor these consulting services to ADB for approval.\n\n5.\n\nDisbursement\n\n69.\nThe  loan  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement\nHandbook dated January 2001, as amended from time to time, and direct payment procedures\nwill  be  used  for  disbursement  of  payments.  To  facilitate  the  implementation  of  the  Project\nthrough the timely release of funds, an imprest account may be established by the Government\nwith  the  Reserve  Bank  of  India  for  the  Project.  The  imprest  account  will  be  managed,\nreplenished,  and  liquidated  in  accordance  with  the  above  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook.  The\ninitial  amount  to  be  deposited  in  the  imprest  account  is  not  to  exceed  10  percent  of  the  loan\namount.  Any  individual  payment  to  be  reimbursed  or  liquidated  under  the  statement  of\nexpenditures  (SOE)  method  for  reimbursement  of  certain  eligible  expenditures  will  not  exceed\nthe equivalent of $100,000.\n\n6.\n\nRecords and Accounts\n\n70.\nNHAI will maintain separate records and accounts adequate to identify works, goods and\nservices  financed  from  the  loan  proceeds,  the  financing  resources  received,  the  expenditures\nincurred for the Project, and local funds. The project accounts will be set up in accordance with\nsound  accounting  principles \nfinancial\nmanagement system).\n\n(Supplementary  Appendix  J  gives \n\nthe  detailed \n\nNHAI uses accrual accounting, and transactions are recorded on a historical cost basis.\n71.\nThe financial statements are in a format prescribed by the Government, and are audited annually\nby the Controller and Auditor General of India (CAG). CAG requires NHAI to prepare a balance\nsheet and a profit and loss statement. At present, NHAI acts as an agent of the Government for\nthe purpose of developing NHs. Accordingly, NHAI does not own the road infrastructure assets.\nOn the balance sheet, road construction expenditure is shown as work in progress, but there is\nno  accounting  policy  for  retaining  these  assets  on  the  books  once  they  are  completed.  Toll\nrevenues  are  not  currently  treated  as  NHAI  income,  but  as  accounts  payable  (to  the\nGovernment). NHAI\u2019s main source of reported revenue is the management fee received from the\nGovernment  in  return  for  completing  the  entrusted  works.  As  long  as  NHAI  accounts  are\nprepared  according  to  government  requirements,  they  will  differ  from  international  accounting\npractices. As NHAI\u2019s financing activities are sophisticated, its accounting policies and standards\nneed to be upgraded in stages. A road map for modernizing of NHAI\u2019s accounting policies and\npractices was agreed upon during loan negotiations (Appendix 8). To facilitate implementation of\nthe road map, it was agreed to provide TA for modernizing the financial reporting system (para.\n50).\n\n\f23\n\nAn  independent  auditor  satisfactory  to  ADB  will  audit  annually  the  project  accounts  and\n72.\nthe  financial  statements  of  NHAI.  The  audited  accounts  and  financial  statements  will  be\nsubmitted to ADB not later than six months after the end of the fiscal year to which they relate.\n\n7.\n\nProject Supervision\n\n73.\nA project inception mission will be fielded soon after effectiveness of the proposed Project\nto  initiate  the  implementation  process.  ADB  staff  will  review  the  project  progress  annually.  In\naddition  to  the  regular  review,  a  detailed  midterm  review  will  be  carried  out  around  May  2003.\nOne item to be assessed is the results of BOT projects along the western transport corridor to\nidentify  appropriate  models  for  private-public  partnership  arrangements.  If  the  midterm  review\nindicates  implementation  problems,  NHAI  and  ADB  will  agree  on  appropriate  measures,\nincluding changes in implementation arrangements, to ensure that the project objectives are met.\n\n8.\n\nProgress Reports and Project Benefit Monitoring\n\nTo monitor execution of the Project, NHAI will submit to ADB quarterly progress reports\n74.\non implementation status. The reports will be based on the monthly and quarterly reports that\nsupervision consultants submit to NHAI. Within three months of the physical completion of the\nProject, NHAI will submit to ADB a project completion report covering details of implementation\ncosts and benefit monitoring and evaluation activities.\n\n75. With  the  assistance  of  the  supervision  consultants,  NHAI  will  undertake  project\nperformance  monitoring  and  evaluation  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Project  Performance\nManagement System Handbook.  The  performance  monitoring  indicators  (PMIs)  agreed  upon\nwith NHAI include\n\n(i) \n\nvolume/capacity ratio of the project road, for measuring capacity expansion;\n\n(ii) \n\ntravel time, for measuring increased efficiency of passenger transport;\n\n(iii) \n\ntraffic fatalities, for measuring increased road safety; and\n\n(iv) \n\nlength of the sections (a) to be developed, and (b) to be operated and maintained\nby the private sector along the WTC, for measuring the extent of private sector\nparticipation.\n\nInitial  values  and  target  values  for  each  PMI,  together  with  the  methodologies  for\n\n76.\ncompiling the date, are presented in Supplementary Appendix K.\n\nF.\n\nExecuting Agency\n\n77.\nNHAI  was  set  up  under  the  National  Highway  Authority  of  India  Act,  1988  (the  NHAI\nAct).  Before this Act, the NH network had mostly been developed through the \u201cagency system\u201d\nin  which  civil  works  of  the  Central  Government  were  delegated  to  state  PWDs.  However,  this\nsystem  did  not  work  well  since  the  Central  Government  did  not  have  direct  control  over  state\nPWDs  and  could  not  ensure  the  timely  delivery  of  projects.  Furthermore,  in  several  cases  the\nCentral  Government  had  to  defend  itself  before  Parliament  for  acts  of  omission  by  PWD  staff\nover which the Central Government agency did not have administrative control. These problems\nled  the  Central  Government  to  establish  its  own  operational  arm  under  the  oversight  of  the\nMinistry of Surface Transport, a predecessor of MORTH.\n\n\f24\n\n78.\nThe NHAI Act was enacted in 1988, but NHAI became operational only in 1995. NHAI is\nmanaged by a board comprising a chairperson reporting to MORTH, five full-time members, and\nfour  part-time  members,  all  Government  appointees.  Its  employees  are  public  servants.  The\norganization  has  200  managerial  and  professional  staff  and  150  supporting  staff.  The\norganization chart of NHAI is shown in Supplementary Appendix L.\n\n79.\nNHAI  has  responsibilities  to  develop,  operate,  and  maintain  the  NH  network  and  other\nfacilities  entrusted  in  it  by  MORTH.  NHAI\u2019s  immediate  mandate  is  to  execute  NHDP  either  by\nitself  or  through  the  use  of  the  private  sector.  It  is  also  responsible  for  developing  and\nmaintaining a dozen road links connecting ports and other key industrial centers. To carry out\nthese activities, NHAI has established several divisions, including those for implementing World\nBank,  ADB,  private  sector,  and  its  own  projects.  It  conducts  project  development  activities,\nincluding \nland  acquisition,\npreconstruction clearances of utilities and trees, and environmental protection.\n\nformulating  projects, \n\nfeasibility  studies, \n\nidentifying  and \n\n80.\nNHAI  has  limited  revenues  and  is  largely  dependent  on  capital  grants  from  the\nGovernment  for  its  highway  development  program.  It  has  also  received  maintenance  grants\nfrom MORTH of around Rs1 billion. However, the NHAI Act states that it should act on business\nprinciples.  NHAI  may  (i)  \u201cinvest  funds  in  the  securities  of  the  Government  or  in  such  other\nmanner as may be prescribed,\u201d (ii) \u201cborrow money from any source by the issuance of bonds,\ndebentures,  and  other  instruments  as  it  may  deem  fit  with  the  consent  of  the  central\nGovernment.\u201d  NHAI\u2019s recent financial statements are shown in Appendix 9.\n\nG.\n\nSocial and Environmental Impacts\n\nA  social  and  environmental  screening  survey  was  carried  out  during  the  project\n81.\nfeasibility  study.  Participatory  processes  were  applied;  project  affected  peoples, \nlocal\ncommunity  leaders,  village  panchayat  heads,  state  officials,  and  a  sample  of  persons  in  the\nproject  influence  area  were  consulted  about  the  proposed  highway  improvements.  The\ncommunities  were  supportive  of  the  Project  owing  to  the  significant  economic  benefits  to  be\ngenerated by highway improvement, and also because of the design features to maximize the\npositive  impact  of  highway  improvement  on  the  local  communities.  The  Project  is  expected  to\nbenefit  the  local  population  by  reducing  the  number  of  traffic  accidents,  which  is  significantly\nhigher in Karnataka State than the national average.\n\n82.\nUnderpasses  and  overpasses  will  facilitate  safe  crossing  of  pedestrians  and  cyclists.\nFencing  is  expected  to  minimize  accidents  including  those  associated  with  these  road  users.\nNHAI will construct parallel service roads for local access. Bus stands and truck parking areas\nwill be developed at appropriate sites to facilitate rest and recreation during travel. Shops and\nconcessionaire  facilities  to  be  established  at  these  spots  will  provide  additional  income-\ngenerating  opportunities  to  the  local  people.  Project-affected  persons  will  have  first  priority  for\noperating food and other services. Road users will benefit from increased comfort, safety, and\nreduced  travel  time.  Perceived  negative  impacts  are  related  to  noise.  Fences  at  both  sides  of\nthe highway will trap the vehicle noise.\n\n1. \n\nEnvironmental Impacts\n\n83.\nThe  Project  is  in  environmental  category  B.  NHAI  consultants  prepared  an  initial\nenvironmental  examination  (IEE)  during  the  feasibility  study  stage  for  the  Tumkur-Harihar  and\nalso  for  the  Harihar-Haveri  sections.  The  IEE  indicates  that  the  Project  will  not  cause  any\nsignificant  adverse  environmental  impacts  as  the  proposed  highway  improvements  will  not\ninvolve  any  realignment  or  major  earthworks.  There  will  be  no  disturbance  to  cultural/heritage\nareas, protected areas, wetlands, or other environmentally sensitive areas. A summary IEE was\n\n\f25\n\nprepared  and  submitted  to  ADB  (Appendix  10).  The  Project  will  comply  with  ADB\u2019s\nEnvironmental Guidelines for Selected Infrastructure Development Projects  of  1993  and  also\nwith the Environmental Assessment Requirements of the Asian Development Bank, 1998.\n\n84.\nAn  environmental  management  action  plan  (EMAP)  was  prepared  for  NHAI  and\ncontractors  to  follow  to  minimize  potential  environmental  impacts.  The  EMAP  summarized  the\nmitigation  proposals  and  allocated  the  responsibility  for  implementing,  testing,  and  monitoring\nduring  the  construction  phase  and  the  first  five  years  of  the  operation  phase  of  the  Project.  It\nwas also agreed that ADB will finance the cost of environmental management training under the\nproposed Project.\n\n2. \n\nResettlement\n\nA  draft  Resettlement  Action  Plan  (RAP)  was  submitted  to  ADB  (summary  in  Appendix\n85.\n11). According to the RAP and the subsequently provided information, the Project will acquire\n1,601 acres of land, of which 1,341 acres is agricultural land, 173 acres is nonagricultural land,\nand  the  remaining  87  acres  are  government  land.  Land  acquisition  will  affect  an  estimated\n18,906  persons.  However,  because  of  strip  acquisition,  impacts  are  not  expected  to  be\nsignificant.  Compensation  will  be  paid  at  replacement  value.  The  Project  will  carry  out\nresettlement in accordance with ADB\u2019s policy on involuntary resettlement and its Handbook on\nResettlement, 1998, as amended from time to time. Land acquisition will impact a total of 541\nprivately  owned  structures  and  affect  3,246  persons.  NHAI  indicated  that  no  relocation  sites\nwere required for housing as all affected persons wished to self-relocate.\n\n86.\nAcquisition of structures will affect 310 families and 1,860 persons without formal title to\nland.  Informal  dwellers,  both  in  residences  and  shops,  will  be  compensated  for  lost  assets  at\nreplacement cost and shifting assistance, and will be entitled to training if they choose to enroll.\nThey  will  be  allowed  to  relocate  as  close  as  possible  to  their  present  location.  The  PIU  will\ndevelop  a  vendors\u2019  market  if  more  than  50  shopkeepers  are  affected.  They  will  be  allowed  to\noccupy the market rent-free for the first six months. Detailed arrangements will be worked out\nduring implementation and from discussions with the vendors themselves. Encroachers who are\nprivate  owners  but  have  encroached  on  government  land  will  be  notified  to  remove  their\nstructures before civil works commence and allowed to salvage materials from the demolished\nstructures.  Vulnerable  families  in  this  category  will  be  assisted  on  a  case-by-case  basis  to\nimprove  their  incomes,  and  compensated  at  replacement  cost  for  their  lost  assets.  Public\nutilities such as water tanks, bore wells, and water pumps; public buildings such as schools and\nhospitals;  common  property  resources;  and  boundary  walls  will  be  affected.  The  original\nalignment  design  was  altered  to  minimize  negative  impacts,  particularly  land  acquisition  and\nresettlement; bypasses will be constructed to avoid heavily populated areas.\n\nNHAI  confirmed  that  a  summary  of  the  draft  resettlement  plan  (RP)  has  already  been\n87.\ndisclosed. Affected persons have been given one month to respond with comments. Responses\nreceived  and  changes  incorporated  will  be  reviewed.  The  final  RP  will  be  translated  into\nKannada  and  made  available  at  the  commissioner\u2019s  office  in  each  district.  The  executive\nsummary,  entitlement  matrix,  budget,  and  TORs  for  the  Implementing  Agency  and  monitoring\nagency  will  be  translated  and  distributed  at  panchayat  offices.  To  avoid  an  influx  of  informal\ndwellers and fraudulent claims during implementation, NHAI issued photo identification cards to\nall squatter occupants in March 2001.\n\n88.\nIt was agreed that the NHAI will establish a resettlement unit (RU) to be headed by the\nProject  Director  in  charge  of  resettlement.  The  Project  Director  will  be  assisted  by  four\nresettlement officers who will be appointed to supervise local-level implementation, each looking\nafter  a  project  district.  To  the  extent  possible,  50  percent  of  personnel  engaged  from\n\n\f26\n\nnongovernment organizations (NGOs) to assist in the resettlement offices will be women. The\nPIU  and  RU  will  be  trained  under  the  ongoing  ADB  TA  for  Capacity  Building  for  Social\nDevelopment (footnote 14).\n\nH. \n\nTechnical Assistance\n\n89.\nIn  conjunction  with  the  Project,  TA  will  be  provided  for  implementing  the  proposed\ncomponent  for  enhancing  corporate  finance  capacity  of  NHAI  (paras.  45\u201353).  The  estimated\ncost  of  the  TA  is  $900,000,  of  which  ADB  will  finance  $700,000  from  the  ADB-funded  TA\nProgram,  and  the  remainder  will  be  financed  by  the  Government.  The  TA  consultants  will  be\nrecruited  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other\narrangements satisfactory to ADB for engaging domestic consultants. The Executing Agency for\nthe TA will be NHAI. The TOR for the TA and costing for consulting services are presented in\nAppendix 12.\n\nV. \n\nPROJECT JUSTIFICATION\n\nA. \n\nFinancial and Economic Analyses\n\n1. \n\nFinancial Analysis\n\nThe  completed  project  highway  will  be  operated  as  a  toll  concession.  The  financial\n90.\ninternal  rate  of  return  (FIRR)  was  calculated  on  the  basis  of  the  project  capital  costs,  O&M\ncosts,  costs  of  toll  collection,  and  revenues  from  the  toll  operations  over  an  assumed  20-year\nperiod. The toll rates used are based on NHAI\u2019s existing schedule of tolls indexed for inflation.\nPrevious willingness-to-pay surveys indicate that road users are prepared to pay the established\ntoll rates in return for better service and facilities. Since access to the project highway will not be\nfully  controlled,  only  a  portion  of  the  traffic  on  the  road  actually  pays  tolls.  The  portion  of  the\ntraffic  that  will  be  tolled  on  different  sections  of  the  road  will  depend  on  the  location  of  the\ntollbooths  as  well  as  the  availability  of  alternate  routes,  both  existing  and  to  be  developed  as\npart of the rural road development program. The traffic surveys provided preliminary information\non the portion of the traffic that would likely be tolled (see Supplementary Appendix M for traffic\nforecast). This was 75 percent of the heavy commercial vehicles and 20 percent of the buses,\nautomobiles,  and  light  commercial  vehicles.  The  expected  FIRR  is  11.1  percent.  A  simulation\ndetermined  the  sensitivity  of  these  results  to  the  assumptions  regarding  traffic  levels,\npercentage of tollable traffic, and construction costs. The results indicate that the FIRR will be\ngreater than 9 percent with a probability of 95 percent. Details of the FIRR calculation and the\nunderlying assumptions are in Supplementary Appendix N.\n\n91.\nA separate cash flow analysis compared the projected inflows from toll revenues with the\nexpected cash outflows. The latter includes the costs for not only operations, maintenance, and\ntoll collection costs but also debt service. The latter includes the 20 percent ADB loan that will\nbe  onlent  from  MOF  to  NHAI  and  the  counterpart  costs  that  will  be  financed  by  NHAI.  The\nanalysis  shows  that  the  projected  inflow  from  toll  revenues  will  cover  the  expected  costs  for\nO&M  and  toll  collection,  but  is  not  sufficient  to  cover  debt  service.  The  latter  will  have  to  be\ncovered through the revenue from the fuel tax. The crossover to positive cash flow is expected\nafter about 7-10 years of operation.\n\n2. \n\nEconomic Analysis\n\n92.\nThe economic evaluation of the Project is based on the comparison of the with-project\nand without-project situations. Without the Project, the existing two-lane road will become more\nheavily  congested  and  vehicle  speeds  will  decline  from  the  current  levels.  As  the  level  of\n\n\f27\n\ncongestion  becomes  unacceptable,  traffic  will  be  diverted  to  local  road  networks  where  these\nare  available  or  growth  of  demand  will  slow  down  where  such  networks  are  nonexistent.\nIncreasing  conflicts  between  fast-  and  slow-moving  vehicles  will  lead  to  a  higher  rate  of\naccidents.  The  high  level  of  utilization  has  already  led  buses  and  trucks  to  travel  at  night  to\navoid  traffic  congestion  and  to  accommodate  curfews  in  larger  urban  centers.  Night  travel  will\nincrease, leading to more accidents in the evening and to greater economic cost because of the\ninability  to  travel  at  the  preferred  time.  Accelerated  pavement  deterioration  through  intensive\nuse will increase vehicle operating costs (VOCs) along the existing two-lane road.\n\n93. With  the  Project,  the  highway  will  be  widened  to  four  lanes,  which  should  provide\nsufficient  capacity  for  the  next  10-15  years  and  allow  higher  operating  speeds  and  better\ndistribution of traffic during the day. The reduction in VOCs and travel time will be substantial.\nDespite  the  increase  in  average  traveling  speed,  the  reduction  in  accidents  will  be  substantial\nbecause traffic in opposite directions will be separated by a median, thereby eliminating many of\nthe head-on collisions and other passing accidents. Comparison of reduced operating costs with\ntolls  indicates  that  commercial  vehicles  will  prefer  the  toll  road  to  a  two-lane  alternative  even\nwith  a  doubling  of  the  tolls.  Comparison  of  the  value  of  time  savings  with  the  level  of  tolls\nsuggests that passenger traffic will prefer the toll road to a two-lane alternative even with a slight\nincrease in the real cost of tolls. The additional capacity will allow the current growth in traffic to\ncontinue unimpeded and will also generate additional traffic by offering producers the option of\ntightening  their  supply  chains,  commuters  the  option  of  longer  commutes,  and  nonbusiness\ntravelers  the  opportunity  to  make  more  frequent  shopping  trips  and  visits  to  relatives  and\nfriends.\n\n94.\nEconomic evaluations were carried out for the eight project sections and for the Project\nas a whole. The economic internal rate of return (EIRR) was calculated for 30 years, which is\nthe  estimated  economic  life  of  the  project  improvement.  The  only  benefits  included  in  this\ncalculation were the savings in VOCs, which include the costs of time for truck and bus drivers\nand their assistants, but not the value of time for other travelers. The economic costs included\ncontracted civil works, procurement of right-of-way, compensation for resettlement, and fees for\nconstruction supervision and project management as well as the additional costs for regular and\nperiodic  maintenance  of  a  four-lane  road  and  the  toll  collection  and  other  operation\nresponsibilities. The costs were calculated using a factor of 0.85 to eliminate taxes, duties, and\nsome  price  distortions.    Both  costs  and  benefits  were  expressed  in  constant  October  2000\nprices.\n\n95.\nBecause  of  uncertainty  regarding  traffic  projections  and  construction  costs,  a  Monte\nCarlo simulation was used to test the project benefits and costs. Sensitivity parameters included\nthe  rates  of  population  and  macroeconomic  growth,  changes  in  vehicle  mix,  and  average\ncapacity and elasticity of demand relative to economic growth. The estimated value of the EIRR\nwas 38 percent. The simulation indicated a 95 percent probability that the EIRR would exceed\n36 percent (Appendix 13). The estimated savings in travel time for passengers, if included in the\nexpected  EIRR,  would  add  3  percent.  The  savings  due  to  fewer  accidents,  specifically  fewer\nhead-on collisions are expected to add 1-2 percent to the computed VOC benefits.\n\n96.\nUp to 50 percent of the reduction in VOCs for heavy commercial vehicles and buses is\nexpected to be passed on to users due to the intense competition in providing these services.\nPart of the savings will be paid out as tolls and part will be retained by the operators to provide\nnewer equipment and to reduce load levels to meet the tougher regulations on traffic using the\nroad. Another part of the savings will go to persons organizing the movement of goods between\nrural  and  urban  areas,  but  again  competition  is  expected  to  limit  their  share.  For  light\ncommercial vehicles, which operate primarily in rural areas, the benefits will accrue in large part\nto  the  users  as  there  is  open  competition  among  operators  of  these  vehicles.  The  savings\n\n\f28\n\nenjoyed  by  automobiles  will  be  passed  on  directly  to  the  owners  of  private  cars  and  their\npassengers  less  the  tolls.  The  users  of  local  taxis  and  two-  and  three-wheel  vehicles  are  also\nexpected to benefit as the competition for providing these services is intense and much of the\njourney will be made without having to pay toll.\n\nIn  addition  to  the  direct  benefits  of  savings  in  VOC,  shorter  travel  time,  and  fewer\n97.\naccidents,  the  Project  is  expected  to  generate  a  number  of  nonquantifiable  benefits  such  as\nmore  reliable  transport  services.  The  benefits  to  intercity  traffic  will  include  a  fundamental\nchange in the nature of traffic due to a significant reduction in travel time, and increased comfort\nand safety.  It is expected that larger, more efficient trucks and tourist quality intercity buses will\nbe introduced. Efforts by NHAI to consolidate truck parking/service/brokering facilities will further\nreduce bus and truck operating costs for the towns and villages along the road; the Project will\nimprove access to the major urban centers and allow a more efficient distribution of goods and\nservices, including industrial and agricultural inputs. As the complementary rural road network is\ndeveloped, the Project will provide villagers with better access to urban markets for sale of their\nlocal produce.\n\nB.\n\nPoverty Impact\n\n98.\nThe socioeconomic indicators of Karnataka State are a little above the national average.\nAccording  to the consultant\u2019s report on poverty impact, conducted in 2000 on the basis of the\ngovernmental  1993/94  survey,  the  proportion  of  the  population  living  below  the  poverty  line\n(PBPL) in Karnataka is 33.2 percent, which is better than the national average of 36.0 percent.18\nThe  poverty-related  issue  in  this  state  is,  however,  not  the  absolute  level  of  poverty,  but  the\nexistence  of  intrastate  disparities.  The  PBPLs  in  the  project  areas  range  from  39.0  percent  to\n49.7  percent,  which  is  higher  than  the  state  average  of  33.1  percent,  and  significantly  higher\nthan those of the wealthier parts of Karnataka. A related poverty problem of the project area is\nthat  the  higher  percentage  of  the  population  is  classified  to  be  scheduled  castes  (SCs)  or\nscheduled  tribes  (STs),  a  most  disadvantaged  group  of  people  in  Indian  society.  They  have\nsuffered  from  geographic  segregation  and  are  deprived  of  various  social  and  economic\nopportunities.  SCs  and  STs  account  for  approximately  30  percent  of  the  population  in  the\nproject area, while the national average is around 20 percent. The higher percentage of PBPLs\nin the project areas is partially explained by the higher percentages of SC and ST. The project\narea is predominantly agricultural (57 percent of the population are engaged in agriculture, half\nof them as landless labor). Agricuture is followed by the manufacturing sector (13 percent) and\ntrade and commerce (12 percent), which are usually more remunerative. Trade and commerce\nactivities are often observed in townships along NH4 and its vicinity.\n\n99.\nThe proposed Project should be regarded as part of the assistance to the Government\u2019s\noverall efforts to improve the entire road network consisting of national, state, district, and rural\nroads.  The  Government\u2019s  road  development  policy  is  comprehensive,  with  the  aim  of\nestablishing total connectivity within the nation. Its emphasis is not only on the NHs, but also on\ndevelopment  of  a  good  rural  road  network.  The  Prime  Minster  recently  announced  an\naccelerated  development  program  for  rural  roads.  Its  target  is  to  link  all  villages  of  more  than\n1,000  population  to  major  road  networks  by  all-weather  roads  by  the  year  2003,  and  those  of\nmore  than  500  population,  by  the  year  2007.  Strong  commitment  by  the  Central  Government\nwas  indicated  by  the  allocation  of  41  percent  of  the  DRF  to  rural  roads,  a  significantly  larger\namount than was committed to the NHDP (33 percent).\n\n                                                          \n18  The  latest  National  Sample  Survey  in  India  conducted  in  2000  and  published  in  2001  indicated  that  the  national\naverage of the proportion of the population living below the poverty line declined from 36.0 percent in 1993/94 to\n26.0 percent in 1999/2000.\n\n\f29\n\n100.\nThe  proposed  Project  is  expected  to  contribute  to  reducing  this  intrastate  poverty\ndiscrepancy  in  a  slightly  different  manner  in  the  short  term  and  long  term.  In  the  short  term,\nconstruction  works  and  tree  planting,  together  with  ensuing  maintenance  works,  will  bring\nimmediate  cash-earning  opportunities  to  the  rural  poor.  Since  the  poor  are  generally  not\nengaged in wage earning jobs and largely dependent on occasional and uncertain employment,\nthese opportunities are more important because of their direct impact on their earnings.\n\n101. More significant are the long-term effects of the Project on reducing intrastate disparities.\nImproved road networks will increase the economic opportunities of the rural communities by (i)\nenabling  villagers  to  shift  from  subsistence  farming  to  market-oriented  agricultural  surplus\nproduction;  and  (ii)  permitting  local  communities,  particularly  rural  youth,  to  move  outside  for\nbetter paying occupations such as those in manufacturing or trading. Improved roads will also\nprovide  social  benefits  such  as  (i)  improved  access  to  health,  education,  and  social  services;\nand  (ii)  increased  access  to  learning  opportunities  including  information  technologies,  thus\nreducing  the  sense  of  isolation  caused  by  physical  remoteness  from  cultural  and  commercial\ncenters.\n\n102. Complementarity with other poverty-related programs also needs to be emphasized. For\ninstance, Karnataka has launched a social program called Swavalambana to provide the rural\nyouth  with  self-employment  opportunities  such  as  poultry  raising  and  mushroom  cultivation  so\nas to facilitate their escape from a vicious cycle of poverty and lack of job opportunities. Another\nexample is the World Bank assistance for the Integrated Rural Water Supply and Environmental\nSanitation  Project,  which  is  to  improve  access  to  potable  water.  These  programs  will  not  be\nsustainable  nor  successful  unless  an  improved  road  network  is  available.  A  proposed  road\nimprovement program will increase the chances of success of these social programs (Appendix\n14 gives the poverty impact assessment).\n\nC. \n\nCommunicable Diseases and Other Social Dimensions\n\n103. Among the South Asian countries, India has the highest prevalence of HIV/AIDS.19 About\n0.7 percent of the sexually active age group of 15-49 is HIV/AIDS infected, which translates into\n3.5 million people, a figure second only to South Africa, which has over 4 million.\n\n104. Because  of  the  seriousness  of  the  incidence  of  sexually  transmitted  diseases,  the\nGovernment has taken a series of actions with the assistance of international aid agencies. In\n1989,  a  medium-term  plan  for  HIV/AIDS  control  was  developed  with  the  support  of  the  World\nHealth Organization. A national HIV/AIDS project financed by the World Bank was approved in\n1992 and extended up to March 1999. On 15 December 1999, India launched the second five-\nyear National AIDS Control Project with a budget of $230 million, comprising $191 million from\nthe  World  Bank  and  $39  million  from  central  and  state  governments.  This  World  Bank  project\naims  at  a  decentralized,  multisectoral  approach  to  HIV  prevention  and  care,  with  the  specific\nobjectives  of  reducing  the  rate  of  growth  of  HIV/AIDS  infection  in  India  and  strengthening  the\ncountry\u2019s  capacity  to  respond  to  the  epidemic  through  cost-effective  prevention  and  care\ninterventions.\n\n105. One  feature  of  India\u2019s  HIV/AIDS  infected  population  is  its  concentration  in  four  states/\nterritories (Maharashtra, Manipur, Pondicherry, and Tamil Nadu), with other states having lower\nrates of infection. Situated between the states of Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu, Karnataka has\nbecome  the  fifth  highly  infected  state.  The  influx  of  construction  labor  in  the  Project  area  may\nfurther increase opportunities for transmitting HIV/AIDS. It was agreed that NHAI will ensure that\ncivil  works  contractors  provide  HIV/AIDS  prevention  training  to  their  construction  workers.  For\n\n                                                          \n19 Human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.\n\n\f30\n\ntruck  drivers,  another  cause  of  HIV/AIDS  transmission,  Karnataka  State  AIDS  Prevention\nSociety  (KSAPS)  has  been  providing  HIV/AIDS  preventive  programs  with  the  assistance  of\nUnited  Kingdom  Department  for  International  Development  (DFID),  mobilizing  a  network  of  25\nlocal NGOs. If further assistance needs are identified, KSAPS may request ADB to extend TA\naimed at reducing poverty in developing member countries.\n\n106. Another potential problem during the construction phase is child labor. It was agreed that\nNHAI will ensure that civil works contracts include a provision forbidding contractors to use child\nlabor. The construction supervision consultants will also ensure compliance with this provision.\n\nD.\n\nRisks\n\n107. A potential risk to the Project is the possible delays in implementation due to prolonged\nland  acquisition.  The  scale  of  land  acquisition  required  for  this  Project  is  not  that  extensive\ncompared with that for the usual highway projects. Over three fourths of the land necessary for\nmain carriageways are already available. Additionally required land is mostly for service roads,\nmost  of  which  is  open  land  where  no  structures  exist  and  thus  less  likely  to  cause  major\nacquisition  problems.  Furthermore,  streamlined  land  acquisition  procedure  recently  introduced\nby the National Highways Laws (Amendment), 1997 (the NH Act) will minimize the potential risk\nof implementation delay. The new procedure has enabled NHAI to proceed with land acquisition\nin  this  Project  in  a  more  expeditious  and  predictable  manner.  Based  on  the  NH  Act,  the\nGovernment has issued public notification (action under Section 3-A of the NH Act) to declare\nits  intention  to  obtain  land  for  public  purposes.  The  deadline  for  filing  objections  (action  under\nSection 3-C of the NH Act) has already passed for the entire land. Objections or concerns filed\nin  response  to  the  above  notification  have  already  been  resolved  or  properly  handled.\nDeclaration  of  acquisition  (action  under  Section  3-D)  will  be  published  by  31  August  2001  for\nfour of the five total contracts for 203 km, and by 30 September 2001 for the balance stretch of\n59 km, covering one contract. In addition to this progress in the land acquisition process, NHAI\nhas assured ADB of expeditious implementation of land acquisition by agreeing that NHAI will\nnot award any civil works contract until after it (i) acquires or makes available on a timely basis\nthe  land  and  rights  to  land,  free  from  any  encumbrances,  required  for  the  execution  of  the\ncontract; and (ii) clears on a timely basis the utilities, trees, and any other obstruction from the\nland to be used for construction activities relating to the contract.\n\n108. Another element that can potentially delay implementation is resettlement. This risk has\nalso been minimized by establishing a resettlement unit in the PIU whose staff will dedicate their\ntime  to  resolving  and  processing  all  resettlement-related  matters  including  the  payment  of\ncompensation. It was agreed that coordination mechanisms would be established at state and\ndistrict levels to resolve any resettlement-related issues that may occur.\n\nVI.\n\nASSURANCES\n\nThe Government and NHAI have given the following specific assurances, in addition to\n\n109.\nthe standard assurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents:\n\n(i) \n\nProject  Execution.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  NHAI  is  delegated\nsufficient  administrative  and \nthe  expeditious\nimplementation of procurement and disbursement for the Project.\n\nfinancial  authority \n\nfor \n\n(ii)\n\nProject implementation\n\n(a) \n\nThe PIU will be delegated sufficient administrative autonomy for effective\nand timely decisions on Project implementation matters.\n\n\f(b) \n\n(c) \n\n(d) \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\n31\n\nNHAI  will  ensure  that  the  PIU  is  adequately  staffed  by  experienced\npersonnel at both managerial and professional levels for effective Project\nimplementation.\n\nNHAI  will  ensure  that  the  PIU  has  a  resettlement  unit  and,  to  the  extent\npossible, 50 percent of the personnel engaged from NGOs to assist in the\nunit will be women.\n\nA high level committee will be set up by NHAI within three months of loan\neffectiveness  in  accordance  with  the  RAP.  The  committee  will  be\nresponsible  for  monitoring  the  implementation  of  the  RAP  and  the\nactivities of the PIU resettlement unit.\n\n(iii)\n\nHighway upgrading\n\nNHAI  will  not  award  any  civil  works  contract  until  after  it  (i)  acquires  or\nmakes  available  on  a  timely  basis  the  land  and  rights  to  land,  free  from\nany  encumbrances  required  for  the  execution  of  the  contract;  and  (ii)\nclears on a timely basis the utilities, trees and any other obstruction from\nthe land to be used for construction activities relating to the contract.\n\nNHAI  will  ensure  timely  administrative  clearance  for  removal  of  utilities\nand  trees  from  the  Project  highway  as  required  for  the  speedy\nimplementation of the Project.\n\n(iv)\n\nRoad safety\n\nNHAI will monitor the incidence of traffic accidents and report to ADB, in a\nformat satisfactory to ADB, during the project implementation period and\ntwo years after its completion.\n\nNHAI  will  carry  out  a  safety  audit  for  the  WTC  during  the  Project\nimplementation period and develop recommendations to be used on other\nparts of the national highway system by 31 December 2004.\n\n(v) \n\nCommercializing  of  operation  and  maintenance.  NHAI  will  ensure  that  upon\ncompletion of the Project highway, its operation and maintenance are awarded to\nthe private sector under concession arrangements satisfactory to ADB. NHAI will\nsubmit  the  terms  and  conditions  of  the  proposed  concession  to  ADB  for  review\nand comment prior to inviting bids from the private sector.\n\n(vi)\n\nEnhancing of the corporate finance capability of NHAI\n\nThe  Government  and  NHAI  will  implement  in  a  timely  manner  the\nthe\nrecommendations  of \nGovernment, ADB, and NHAI. For this purpose NHAI will establish a task\nforce, or assign an appropriate team by 31 October 2001.\n\nthe  TA,  as  mutually  agreed  upon  by \n\nNHAI will also implement the first securitization project through its special\npurpose  vehicles,  based  on  the  results  of  the  TA,  by  31  March  2004  or\nsuch  other  dates  acceptable  to  the  Government,  ADB,  and  NHAI,  under\narrangements satisfactory to ADB and the Government.\n\n\f(vii)\n\nEnvironment\n\n32\n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\n(a)\n\nNHAI  will  ensure  that  the  Project  is  undertaken  in  compliance  with  the\nEnvironmental  Assessment  Requirements  of  ADB,  1998  and \nthe\nEnvironmental  Guidelines  for  Selected  Infrastructure  Development\nProjects, 1993, as amended from time to time.\n\nNHAI  will  ensure  that  all  environmental  mitigation  measures  identified  in\nthe  summary  initial  environmental  examination  are  incorporated  into  the\ndetailed  project  design  and  are  followed  during  construction,  operation,\nand  maintenance  of  the  Project  highway.  NHAI  will  also  ensure  that  the\nProject  is  designed  and  constructed  according  to  the  Environmental\nManagement  Action  Plan  agreed  upon  with  ADB  in  accordance  with\nADB\u2019s Environmental Guidelines for Selected Infrastructure Development\nProjects.\n\n(c) \n\nNHAI  will  conduct  a  training  program  for  environmental  management  for\nits staff as well as for the staff of the contractors under the Project.\n\n(viii) Resettlement plan\n\nimplement \n\nthe  RAP  agreed  upon  with  ADB,  under\nNHAI  will \narrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  policy  on\ninvoluntary  resettlement  and  Handbook  on  Resettlement,  1998,  as\namended from time to time.\n\nNHAI  will  ensure  that  any  person  who  may  be  relocated  as  a\nconsequence  of  the  Project  is  consulted  and  fairly  compensated  on  the\nbasis of replacement values such that his or her living standards are not\nadversely affected by the Project.\n\n(c) \n\nNHAI will carry out timely settlement of compensation payments for land\nacquired for the Project.\n\n(ix)\n\nSocial measures\n\nNHAI will ensure public awareness and acceptance of the Project through\nparticipation, as necessary, of NGOs and the community.\n\nNHAI will ensure under civil works contracts that contractors (a) will carry\nout, including through engaging suitable nongovernmental organizations,\nthe HIV/AIDS awareness and prevention programs for labor; and (b) will\nnot use children as labor, by incorporating a provision to these effects in\ntheir contracts.\n\n(x)\n\nProject Implementation, benefit monitoring, and progress review\n\nThe Government and NHAI will undertake periodic reviews during Project\nimplementation,  to  evaluate  the  scope,  implementation  arrangements\n(with  due  participation  of  nongovernment  and  community-based\norganizations),  benefit  monitoring,  progress  and  achievement  of  the\nobjectives  of

 granting\nenvironmental  clearance  (EC)  for  development  projects  including  highways.  In  1997,  MOEF\nannounced exemption from EC for any highway improvement project on an existing alignment\nwith  \u201cmarginal  land  acquisition\u201d,  provided  it  did  not  pass  through  ecologically  sensitive  areas\nsuch  as  national  parks,  sanctuaries,  tiger  reserves,  and  forest  reserves.    In  1999,  MOEF\nannounced further that \u201cmarginal land acquisition\u201d means land acquisition not exceeding a total\nof  20  meters  (m)  wide  on  average,  and  that  short  realignments  and  bypasses  would  also  be\nexempt if the cost of the realignments or bypasses alone did not exceed $10.9 million (Rs500\nmillion).\n\n2.\nAs a matter of policy, MOEF requires a detailed environmental impact assessment (EIA)\nfor all highway projects costing more than Rs500 million, even if they are exempt from EC. The\npurpose of the EIA study is to identify environmental issues that have significant impact due to\nthe  improvement  of  an  existing  highway;  assess  impacts  related  to  project  locations,\nconstruction,  and  operations;  and  propose  suitable  mitigation  measures.  The  Asian\nDevelopment Bank (ADB) put the project highway in environmental category B and required an\ninitial environmental examination (IEE) to ensure that any environmental concerns of the Project\nare reviewed and considered. The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) thus appointed\nits project design consultants to prepare an EIA, which was then revised into an IEE following\nADB format, to meet the environmental requirements of both MOEF and ADB.\n\nThis summary IEE (SIEE) is based on a review of the EIA and information gathered by\n\n3.\nthe project preparatory technical assistance (see footnote 16 in page 14).\n\nB. \n\nDescription of the Project\n\n4. \nThe project highway is part of National Highway No. 4 (NH4) traversing Karnataka State\nand connecting the major ports of Mumbai and Chennai. The project will reconstruct and widen\nthe present 259 km single carriageway Tumkur\u2013Harihar\u2013Haveri section of NH4 passing through\nthe  Tumkur  and  Sira  Taluks  of  Tumkur  District,  the  Chitradurga  and  Hiriyur  Taluks  of\nChitradurga  District,  the  Davanagere  and  Harihar  Taluks  of  Davanagere  District,  and  the\nRannibennuer, Byadgi and Haveri Taluks of Haveri District.\n\n5. \nIt  is  proposed  that,  the  existing  single  carriageway  be  widened  by  constructing  two\nadditional lanes and a central median along the existing two lanes. Some 24 kilometers (km) of\nbypass is proposed at four congested urban areas while, in other less congested urban areas,\nconcentric widening with a narrow median is proposed to limit land acquisition.\n\nService/side roads running parallel to and within the NH4 right-of-way are proposed for\n6. \n75 percent of the project length to serve as collectors/distributors for local traffic, thus separating\nthe local slow-moving traffic from the fast traffic on the NH4.\n\nThe  project  will  be  implemented  under  five  concurrent  construction  contracts.  The\n7. \ncontracts are expected to be awarded in October 2001 with expected completion date of June\n2005.\n\n\f49\n\nAppendix 10, page 2\n\nC.\n\nDescription of the Environment\n\n1. \n\nPhysical Environment\n\n8.\nThe  existing  alignment  of  the  project  highway  is  located  in  the  plains  of  the  South\nDeccan  Plateau,  which  is  rolling  terrain  with  gentle  slopes  and  occasional  rocky  outcrop.\nGeologically  the  rock  formation  forms  part  of  the  Peninsular  Shield  and  comprises  Peninsular\ngneiss  and  upper  Dharward  schist.  The  route  of  the  NH4  between  Tumkur  and  Harihar  falls\nwithin  the  Tungabhadra  River  subbasin.  The  project  corridor  is  characterized  by  excessively\nwell-drained  clayey  soils  with  moderate  to  severe  erosion  potential.  The  soil  in  the  Harihar\u2013\nHaveri section (Km 282-340) is predominantly clayey and black and is known as Black Cotton\nSoil as it is ideal for growing cotton. Its erosion potential is low.\n\n9.\nThe  region  gets  maximum  rainfall  during  the  southwest  monsoon  (June\u2013September),\nwith  annual  rainfall  in  the  range  of  600  millimeters  (mm)  to  1,000  mm.  The  temperature  is\nmoderate  with  the  highest  rarely  exceeding  36\u00baC  and  the  minimum  rarely  below  17\u00baC.\nDepending on the season, the relative humidity varies from up to 87 percent in the morning to\nas low as 27 percent in the evening. The predominant wind direction is west, but southwest for\n20 percent and east for 26 percent of the year. The region has clear visibility of over 20 km for\n300 days a year on average.\n\n10.\nThe  project  highway  traverses  numerous  drainage  channels  and  rivulets  of  the\nTungabhadra  subbasin  including  the  river  itself.  There  are  more  than  400  drainage  structures\nand six major bridges, which will need to be upgraded to provide cross drainage for the widened\nhighway.  The  rivers  and  drainage  channels  along  the  project  route  are  dry  for  some  9\u201310\nmonths  of  each  year.  Rainfall  during  the  monsoon  is  stored  in  tanks/ponds  and  provides\nirrigation  for  crops  and  water  for  livestock  for  2\u20133  months.  Two  of  the  tanks,  Arasinakere  and\nMatadakere, between Km 202\u2013204 have historic importance, with associated ancient religious\nbuildings.\n\n11. \nBoreholes and wells are a prime source of water for the population in the corridor and for\nagriculture.    Groundwater  extraction  is  significantly  high  in  the  taluka  of  Tumkur,  which  is\ncategorized  as  Dark,  indicating  groundwater  utilization  exceeds  85  percent  of  the  reserve  \u2013  a\ncritical  status,  with  little  scope  for  further  exploitation.    Water  levels  below  ground  level  during\n1978\u20131997  indicate  a  cumulative  decline  from  10  meters  (m)  to  15  m  in  this  taluka.  The\ngroundwater levels in the other talukas are categorized as Grey (utilization 80-50 percent of the\nreserve), or White (utilization less than 50 percent of the reserve) and therefore have potential\nfor extraction of water.\n\n12.  Water  quality  in  the  project  corridor  was  monitored  at  the  Tungabhadra  River  and  at\nsampling stations located at bridge crossings, tubewells, and dug wells. The results indicate that\nthe  pH  value  of  the  water  in  the  river  is  8.4,  that  at  the  other  locations  range  from  7.2  to  8.2.\nDissolved  oxygen  was  5.1  milligrams  (mg)/liter  at  the  river  and  at  the  other  locations  4.2  -o  6\nmg/liter.  Biological oxygen demand was 16 mg/liter at the river and 3.5-32 mg/liter at the other\nlocations.  Total  dissolved  solids  were  145  mg/liter  at  the  river  and  324-1,030  mg/liter  at  the\nother locations. The results show that the concentration of dissolved solids in surface water is\nwithin safe limits for aquatic life.  However, the biological oxygen demand in both surface water\nand  groundwater  needs  conventional  treatment  and/or  disinfection  before  the  water  is  use  for\ndrinking.\n\n\f50\n\nAppendix 10, page 3\n\n13.\nThe  baseline  ambient  air  quality  was  assessed  at  nine  locations  close  to  human\nsettlements. The air quality parameters recorded were suspended particulate matter of 136\u2013260\nmicrograms per cubic meter (\u00b5g/m\u00b3), respirable particulate matter of 40\u201372 \u00b5g/m\u00b3,  sulfur oxides\nof 18\u201342 \u00b5g/m\u00b3, nitrogen oxides of 11\u201336 \u00b5g/m\u00b3, carbon monoxide of 800\u20131,800 \u00b5g/m\u00b3, lead of\n0.008\u2013/0.015  \u00b5g/m\u00b3,  and  hydrocarbons  of  0.6\u20132.1  \u00b5g/m\u00b3.  The  average  air  quality  values  are\nwithin  the  national  ambient  air  quality  standards  set  by  the  Central  Pollution  Control  Board  of\nIndia for residential and rural areas.\n\n14.\nBaseline ambient noise level monitoring was carried out at 14 stations along the project\ncorridor. The background ambient noise levels of 62\u201371 decibels (dB)(A) in daytime and 68\u201357\ndB(A)  at  nighttime  exceed  the  maximum  limits  set  by  the  Central  Pollution  Control  Board  of\nIndia for residential and commercial areas.\n\n15. \n\nAgriculture accounts for 74 percent of land use in the project corridor.\n\n2. \n\nEcological Resources\n\n16.\nThe  project  highway  does  not  pass  through  forest  reserves  but  passes  through  village\nforests  at  12  locations  in  Tumkur,  Sira,  and  Hiriyur  taluks.  The  village  forests  have  been\ndeveloped  under  various  state  government  programs  including  social  forestry  by  the  Forest\nDepartment.  In  some  stretches  of  the  project  corridor,  trees  are  40-50  years  old  and  include\ngiant tamarind, neem, banyan, and peepal. In some sections, trees on both sides of the existing\nroad have formed a symmetrical canopy to give the appearance of a green tunnel. Giant trees\nfound  within  village  limits  are  observed  to  be  focal  points  for  social  interaction,  for\ncommunity/religious congregations, or for weekly markets.\n\n17.\n\nThere are no reports of wild life species or endangered species in the project corridor.\n\nThere are no cultural heritage sites, sensitive or critical habitats, national parks, wild life\n\n18. \nsanctuaries, wetlands, or protected nature reserves along the project corridor.\n\nNo protected/declared archaeological sites or historical monuments are affected by the\n19. \nproject. A fort in ruins 30 m from the right-of-way near Aimangala (Km 178\u2013179) has historical\nsignificance, but is neither protected nor declared a monument and is not physically affected by\nthe project.\n\n3. \n\nHuman and Economic Development and Quality of Life Values\n\nThe  1991  census  shows  that  83  percent  of  the  population  in  the  five  districts  of  the\n20. \ncorridor are rural (the All India average is 74 percent) and 17 percent are urban. Of these, 13\u2013\n21  percent  are  scheduled  castes  (the  All  India  average  is  16  percent)  and  5\u201317  percent  are\nscheduled tribes (All India average is 8 percent).\n\nThe  physical  infrastructure  for  education  is  generally  inadequate  and  accounts  for  the\n\n21. \nliteracy level of 52\u201356 percent, which approximates the All India average of 52 percent.\n\nPublic  health  facilities  are  available,  but  medical  infrastructure  is  not  consistent.  The\n22. \ninfant  mortality  rate  is  51\u201374  per  thousand  compared  with  the  All  India  average  of  72  per\nthousand.\n\n\f51\n\nAppendix 10, page 4\n\nD. \n\nScreening of Potential Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures\n\n1. \n\nEarthworks\n\n23. \nAn  impact  of  any  major  highway  project  is  the  requirement  of  fill  material  for\nembankments (for this project some 13 million m3).  The project highway has been designed as\na  widening  scheme  and  the  utilization  of  the  existing  road,  and  consequently  the  existing\nembankment, minimizes the earthwork requirement.\n\n24. \nThe construction contractor will be responsible for obtaining the borrow material, but the\ndesign consultants have identified the tank beds and dry highlands as acceptable and economic\nsources  along  the  corridor.  The  contractor  will  be  required  to  obtain  the  approval  of  the\nDepartment  of  Mines  and  Geology  of  the  state  for  borrow  from  the  dry  highlands  and  the\napproval of the Minor Irrigation Department for borrow from the tank beds.\n\n25.  Where borrow is from tank beds, the contractor will be required to excavate uniformly to\nmaintain a smooth bed profile and to regrade the inlet channels for a distance of at least 100 m.\nIn the case of tank beds acquired for a highway project, the respective tanks are to be desilted\nin consultation with the Minor Irrigation Department, government of Karnataka, to maintain the\nexisting storage capacity. These measures will support the current state program to maximize\nreplenishment  of  groundwater  resources  by  improving  inlets  and  desilting  the  tanks.  The\nearthwork operations for the highway will only take place in the dry season when the tanks are\nalso dry; therefore there will be no impact on replenishment.\n\n26.  Where borrow is from dry highlands, the area will be reinstated by forming gentle slopes\nand planting trees.\n\nThe  contractor  will  be  required  to  construct  gravel  haul  roads  to  and  from  the  borrow\n27. \nareas and to suppress dust by regular spraying with water. The haul roads will be reinstated on\ncompletion of the works and left for use by the local community.\n\n2. \n\nAggregates\n\n28. \nThe quantity of aggregates for the pavement and for concrete is estimated to be 5 million\nm3. The contractor will be required to obtain these from quarries licensed by the Department of\nMines and Geology of the Karnataka government. Quarry operators will be required to comply\nwith  the  relevant  legislation  for  occupational  safety  and  to  adopt  adequate  dust  suppression\nmeasures.\n\nThe  contractor  will  be  required  to  construct  single-lane  haul  roads  from  the  quarries  to\n29. \nthe site, if not already existing, and to suppress dust by regular spraying with water. The haul\nroads  will  be  reinstated  on  completion  of  the  works  and  will  be  left  for  use  by  the  local\ncommunity.\n\n\f52\n\nAppendix 10, page 5\n\n3. \n\nGroundwater\n\nThe water required for construction is estimated to be some 32 m3 per kilometer per day.\n30. \nIt is anticipated that the contractor will sink boreholes to obtain this water and so will be required\nto obtain approval from the Ground Water Authority of Karnataka.\n\n31. \nThe water requirement represents about 10 percent of the average annual recharge of\ngroundwater and may result in some short-term impact to the aquifer, particularly in the Tumkur\ntaluka where existing demand exceeds 85 percent of the reserves. This will be mitigated, where\nnecessary, by constructing of additional percolation tanks, pits, and shafts to increase the rate\nof recharging in the monsoon season. NHAI will coordinate the mitigation work with the Ground\nWater  Authority,  which  is  currently  implementing  statewide  monitoring  and  a  replenishment\nprogram.\n\n32. \nEight  tanks  fall  within  the  proposed  widened  right-of-way.  They  will  be  considered  for\ndesilting,  in  consultation  with  the  Minor  Irrigation  Department,  to  maintain  the  existing  storage\ncapacity/volume. Impact on the water bodies will not be significant.\n\n4. \n\nWater Bodies\n\n5. \n\nWater Quality\n\nThe  surface  water  drainage  system  for  the  project  will  comprise  concrete-lined  side\n\n33. \nditches that discharge into the nearest available watercourse or body.\n\n34. \nThe  contractor  will  be  required  to  provide  adequate  water  supply,  septic  tanks,  and\nsoakaway  pits  for  the  wastes  from  the  labor  camps  and  from  plant,  storage,  and  workshop\nareas. In addition, the petrol, oil, and lubricant storage areas will have impervious floors, oil and\ngrease in storm runoff will be trapped prior to final disposal into nearby watercourses.\n\n6. \n\nLandscape and Planting\n\n35. \nApproximately 20,500 trees will be felled within the proposed right-of-way. They are not\necologically or commercially significant, but are a visual benefit to road users and the adjacent\ncommunities.\n\n36. \nFor loss of forest, the Karnataka Forest Department requires that compensatory planting\namounting  to  double  the  trees  felled.  NHAI  will  provide  the  department  with  funds  for\nreplacement planting.\n\n37. \nIn addition, NHAI will do amenity planting within the new right-of-way and will appoint a\nspecialist  consultant  to  prepare  the  landscape  design  for  the  project  highway.  The  planting\ndesign  will  incorporate  indigenous  species  that  offer  variety  and  visual  interest,  and  require\nminimum maintenance after establishment. Shrubs will be planted on the median strip. NHAI will\nappoint  a  specialist  to  implement  the  planting  and  getting  responsible  for  maintenance  and\nwatering for three years when the plants are getting established.\n\nThe proposed planting will be denser than the existing and in the medium to long term\n\n38. \nwill significantly improve aesthetics and screening along the route.\n\n\f53\n\nAppendix 10, page 6\n\n7. \n\nLand Use\n\nThe  predominant  land  use  in  the  acquired  right-of-way  is  agriculture.  The  remaining\n\n39. \nareas are either dryland unsuitable for agriculture or commercial land.\n\n40. \nLand  acquisition  has  been  restricted  to  20  m  wide  on  average,  except  at  junctions,\nrealignments,  and  bypasses  where  acquisition  is  60  m.  In  urban  areas,  land  acquisition  is\nlimited by the use of concentric widening with a narrow median. At four locations, bypasses will\nbe constructed to totally avoid significant demolition of houses and buildings.\n\n41. \nService  roads/side  roads  parallel  to  the  national  highway  will  serve  as  connector  and\nfeeder roads for the local communities. They will increase safety by separating the local slow-\nmoving traffic from the fast traffic on the main road and by limiting and controlling the junctions\nonto  the  main  road.  Cross  movement  of  the  local  traffic  between  service/side  roads  on  each\nside  of  the  national  highway  will  be  accommodated  in  underpasses  and  box  culverts  and\nbridges  widened  to  provide  for  vehicles.  Causeways  at  watercourses  will  be  built  on  the\nservice/side roads.\n\n42. \nThese  measures  will  ensure  that  the  new  dual  carriageway  will  not  keep  the  local\ncommunities apart and slow-moving local traffic need not join the fast-moving traffic on the new\nhighway.\n\n43. \nDuring  design  development  the  public  expressed  concern  regarding  the  impact  of  the\nproposed  widening  on  two  historical  tanks  near  Chitradurga  (Km  202\u2013204).  As  a  result,  the\ndesign  was  restricted  to  a  reduced  width  of  right-of-way,  thus  avoiding  the  need  for  land\nacquisition within these tank beds.\n\n8. \n\nNoise\n\n44. \nTraffic  on  the  widened  and  improved  road  will  flow  more  smoothly.  As  a  result  traffic\nnoise  will  become  a  component  of  ambient  noise,  which  is  less  intrusive  than  the  erratic\nincreases  in  noise  levels  associated  with  congested  single  carriageways  and  substandard\npavement designs. A noise model is being developed to predict noise levels for the project.\n\n45. \nThe  survey  of  existing  noise  levels  in  villages  and  built-up  areas  generally  shows  the\nneed for noise attenuation. The proposed design therefore calls for concrete or masonry walls\n1.5 m high between the main carriageway and the service/side road.\n\nAt 32 locations, 2 m high walls will reduce noise for owners of specific buildings such as\n\n46. \nhospitals, schools, and health centers where noise levels already are at undesirable levels.\n\n47. \nDuring  construction,  the  contractor  will  be  required  to  deploy  plant  and  equipment  not\nolder than five years and to regularly maintain them. Construction work in the urban and other\nsettlement areas will be restricted to daytime hours.\n\n9. \n\nVibration\n\n48. \nThe State Department of Archaeology identified the ramparts of a ruined fort at Aimangla\n(Km  178\u2013179)  as  having  historical  importance,  though  they  do  not  comprise  a  protected  or\n\n\f54\n\nAppendix 10, page 7\n\ndeclared monument. It is within 30 m of the existing right-of-way and may experience vibration\ndue to passing traffic.\n\nTo  limit  the  vibration  and  its  effect  on  the  building,  a  2  ms  deep  buried  cutoff  wall  of\n49. \nloose-grained  sand  will  be  constructed  within  the  right-of-way.  This  type  of  mitigation  has\nsuccessfully attenuated vibration caused by trains in India.\n\n10.\n\nAir Quality\n\n50. \nThe draft IEE report indicates that implementing the Project is likely to improve air quality\nbecause vehicles on the project road will be able to travel at higher speeds with less emissions.\n\n51. \nThe  air  quality  survey  shows  that  5  of  the  16  samples  exceed  the  threshold  levels  for\nsuspended  particulate  matter.  The  samples  were  from  congested  urban  areas  or  at  junctions\nwhere average traffic speed is 20\u201340 kilometer per hour (kph). With the project providing grade\nseparated interchanges and bypasses, it is expected that these average speeds will increase to\n80\u2013100 kph, with a resulting reduction in emission levels.\n\n52. \nAt  present,  properties  are  10\u201315  m  from  the  centerline  of  the  existing  road.  The\nproposed design increases the distance to 23.5 m in urban areas. Research in other countries\nindicates that concentrations of emissions decrease significantly with distance.\n\nNHAI  consultants  are  developing  an  air  quality  model  to  more  accurately  predict\n\n53. \nemission levels for the Project and the resulting impact on the adjacent environment.\n\n11.\n\nShrines\n\nA  small  number  of  small  shrines,  idols,  and  tombs  falling  within  the  proposed  right-of-\n54. \nway  will  be  relocated  in  consultation  with  the  local  community  leaders.  Initial  indications  show\nthat there will be no objections to the proposals.\n\n12.\n\nEnvironmental Management Action Plan\n\n55. \nThe  NHAI  design  consultant  prepared  an  environmental  management  action  plan\n(EMAP)  which  summarizes  the  mitigation  proposals  and  assigns  the  responsibility  for\nimplementing,  testing,  and  monitoring  during  the  construction  phase  and  during  the  first  five\nyears of the operation of the project.\n\nE.\n\nInstitutional Requirement and Environmental Monitoring Program\n\nThe  project \n\n56. \nthe\nenvironmental elements of the five construction packages through the supervision consultants.\nSuitable provisions in this aspect have been made in the draft terms of reference.\n\nimplementation  unit  (PIU)  of  NHAI  will  manage  and  monitor \n\n57. \n  The  contractors  will  be  required  to  appoint  their  own  environmental  officer  to  be\nresponsible  for  their  environmental  obligations  under  the  contract  and  for  their  general\nobligations  under  relevant  laws  and  regulations.  The  contractors\u2019  and  the  supervision\nconsultant's environmental officers will liaise on all matters relating to the environment.\n\n\f55\n\nAppendix 10, page 8\n\n58. \nNHAI will also appoint a part-time environmental adviser who will have an audit role for\nthe environmental works and will advise on any matters that are outside the experience of the\ncontractors or the supervision consultants.\n\n59. \nAn accredited laboratory appointed by the contractor under the construction contract will\ncarry out sampling and testing. The contractor will be responsible for undertaking sufficient and\nadequate  environmental  testing  to  demonstrate  to  NHAI  and  to  the  environmental  auditor  that\nhe is complying with all his contractual and legal obligations.\n\nNHAI  proposed  to  arrange  at  least  two  environmental  training  seminars  during  the\n\n60. \nconstruction period.  NHAI staff and the contractor will be required to attend.\n\nF.\n\nFindings and Recommendations\n\n61. \nReconstruction and widening of road are likely to have significant long-term benefits for\nall  road  users  and  for  inhabitants  of  settlements  near  the  road.  Road  users  will  benefit  from\nreduced travel time, vehicle operating costs, traffic congestion, and road accidents and will save\nfuel.  Local  residents  will  have  increased  economic  and  employment  opportunities,  improved\naccess  to  services  and  facilities,  reliable  transport  services  for  freight  traffic,  reduced  noise\nlevels,  and  improved  air  quality.  The  provision  of  service/side  roads  interconnected  by\nunderpasses  will  remove  the  conflict  between  slow  nonmotorized  traffic  and  fast  motorized\ntraffic for local residents and thereby make their daily lives safer.\n\nBecause the project is a widening scheme with an average additional land width of 20 m,\n62. \ndirect adverse impacts on the physical, biological, and socioeconomic environments will be few.\nAdverse  impacts  on  the  biological  environment  include  reduced  vegetation  in  the  short  term\nwhile the new planting is getting established. Negative socioeconomic impacts include possible\ndisruption  of  utility  lines,  accident  risks  during  construction,  risk  of  communicable  diseases\ntransmitted  through  contact  of  residents  with  road  workers  and  drivers  of  freight  trucks,  and\ndisruption of community cohesion and the social fabric.\n\nThe project is judged to have some environmental impact, but the mitigation proposals\n63. \nreduce  their  significance.  There  are  no  permanent  long-term  significant  impacts  and  therefore\nthe project is assigned to category B. An EIA is not required.\n\nG. \n\nConclusions\n\n64.\nReconstructing  and  widening  the  existing  highway  will  have  positive  impacts  by\nimproving  regional  transport  links  and  increasing  economic  opportunities  for  local  residents.\nThe  adverse  impacts  of  the  project  will  be  mitigated  to  acceptable  levels  based  on  the  IEE\nprepared by the NHAI design consultants, which will be supported by the EMAP. The EMAP will\nbe  sufficiently  detailed  to  clearly  provide  for  enforceable  action  to  be  undertaken  by  the\ncontractor. It will also guide NHAI in protecting and conserving the environment while operating\nand maintaining the finished dual carriageway.\n\n\f56\n\nAppendix 11, page 1\n\nSUMMARY RESETTLEMENT ACTION PLAN\n\nA. \n\nThe Project\n\n1. \nThe  western  transport  corridor  (WTC),  comprising  National  Highway  No.  8  (NH8)  and\nNH4,  connecting  Delhi,  Mumbai,  Bangalore,  and  Chennai,  is  one  of  the  busiest  corridors  in\nIndia.  The  section  between  Bangalore  and  Mumbai  falling  within  NH4  also  has  high  traffic\nintensity.  To  decongest  this  stretch,  the  National  Highways  Authority  of  India  (NHAI)  with\nfinancial  support  from  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  is  preparing  plans  and  designs  to\nwiden  and  strengthen  the  259-kilometer  (km)  stretch  between  Tumkur  and  Haveri  on  NH4  in\nKarnataka State.\n\n2. \nThe  Project  aims  to  remove  capacity  constraints  and  improve  road  safety  on  critical\nsections of the WTC between Tumkur and Haveri. Some stretches on the WTC are already four\nlanes,  widening  work  is  in  progress  on  some  sections,  and  plans  for  the  remaining  stretches\ninclude  development  by  other  sources  like  private  investment,  own  resources,  multilateral\nfunding, etc. Contracts for civil construction for the entire section are set for award by October\n2001, with completion by June 2005.\n\nB. \n\nProject Area\n\n3. \nThe project highway starts at Km 75 (Tumkur) and ends at Km 340 (Haveri) of NH4 in\nKarnataka  State.  The  existing  NH  is  a  two-lane  single  carriageway.  It  traverses  128  villages,\nwhich  abut  the  project  road  in  the  districts  of  Tumkur,  Chitradurga,  Davangere,  and  Haveri.  A\nfour-lane bypass to Sira town between Km 116 and Km 122 is being developed through NHAI's\nown  resources;  construction  work  commenced  in  August  2000.  Similarly,  the  30-km  stretch\nbetween Bangalore and Neelmangla is already four-lane and the Neelmangla-Tumkur section is\nplanned for development through build-operate-transfer scheme.\n\n4. \nThe right-of-way (ROW) defined for the project is 60 meters (m) in the rural areas and 47\nm  in  the  built-up  areas.  Existing  ROW  varies  between  30  m  and  50  m.  The  stretch  consists\npredominantly  of  agricultural  land  and  industrial  centers  at  Tumkur  and  Davangere.  The  other\nmain built-up areas are commercial centers along the stretch.\n\nC. \n\nLand Acquisition Policy Framework\n\n5. \nThe  Land  Acquisition  Act  of  1894,  with  amendments,  governs  land  acquisition  in  the\ncountry as a whole. The act defines parameters for identifying and compensating for acquired\nlands in India. Although a national resettlement and rehabilitation policy is under formulation, the\ncentral  and  the  state  governments  have  developed  and  applied  resettlement  action  plans\n(RAPs)  on  a  project-specific  basis.  For  NHs,  land  acquisition  is  governed  by  the  National\nHighways Act of 1956, which incorporates provisions of the 1894 Act. With a view to facilitate\nhighway  improvements,  the  NH  Act  was  amended  in  1997  and  the  procedure  for  land\nacquisition was simplified considerably.\n\n6. \nThe RAP for this Project is guided by ADB\u2019s policy on involuntary resettlement, approved\nin  November  1995,  and  based  on  a  full  census  of  the  project-affected  persons  (APs).  The\ncensus  was  conducted  in  three  rounds:  first  in  April/May  1999,  prior  to  finalizing  alignment;\nsecond in June-October 2000 after finalizing the alignment; and third in December 2000 for the\nremaining  (15  percent)  APs.  The  objective  of  the  RAP  is  to  minimize  the  adverse  impacts  of\n\n\f57\n\nAppendix 11, page 2\n\nroad construction and improvement on the APs. The RAP identifies (i) the extent and nature of\nlosses of the APs, (ii) the policies and legal framework, (iii) provisions made for compensation\npayments and relocation, and (iv) accountability in implementing the RAP. The RAP has been\ndiscussed extensively with the APs and NHAI.\n\n7. \nThe  basic  principles  on  which  the  RAP  was  developed  include  (i)  avoiding  involuntary\nresettlement wherever feasible, (ii) minimizing of resettlement where population displacement is\nunavoidable, and (iii) ensuring that displaced people receive assistance so that they are at least\nas well-off as they would have been in the absence of a development project.  On the basis of\nthe  rules  and  regulations  at  the  state  and  national  levels  as  well  as  policies  and  practices  for\nresettlement  planning  and  management  in  externally  financed  projects,  compensation  for  the\nAPs will be in the form of either land or cash, or both.\n\nD. \n\nProject Impact\n\nA total of 541 privately owned structures will be acquired. As a result, 541 families and\n8. \n3,246 persons will be affected. Of the privately owned structures, 204 will be fully acquired and\n337 partially acquired. In addition, 310 families and 1,860 persons without title will be affected\nby the acquisition of 310 structures. The project will also acquire 1,514 acres of privately owned\nland, with effect on 3,151 families or 18,906 persons. Total acquisition of their lands will affect\n74 families. In addition to privately owned land, 87 acres of government land will be acquired by\nthe  Project.  A  total  of  27  government  owned  structures  will  be  acquired.  They  include  social\ninfrastructure such as schools, clinics, and government offices.\n\nE. \n\nEntitlements\n\n9. \nA  detailed  entitlement  matrix  was  developed  setting  out  the  losses,  compensation,\nentitlements,  and  accountabilities  associated  with  impacts  under  the  Project.  Land  losses\nsuffered  by  the  APs  have  been  categorized  under  two  heads:  (i)  APs  losing  a  part  of  their\nhouses, and (ii) APs losing entire houses. Provisions have also been made for loss of orchard\nlands and private factory lands. In general, compensation at market rates will be paid to persons\nlosing  lands.  Compensation  for  loss  of  structures  has  been  computed  at  current  construction\n(replacement) cost levels. Income losses will be compensated accordingly. The cut off date for\neligibility for entitlements is the date of completion of the census surveys for nonholders of titles\n(April-May 1999 for Tumkur-Harihar section and December 2000 for Harihar-Haveri section) and\npublication of notification under section 3A(i) of NHAI act for landowners.\n\nF. \n\nOrganizational Arrangements\n\n10. \nNHAI is the Executing Agency for the Project. The project implementation unit (PIU) of\nNHAI  will  supervise  all  planning,  implementing,  and  monitoring  activities  associated  with  the\nRAP. The unit will be headed by the project director of the level of general manager. The PIU\nwill have a resettlement cell for each district, which will be supported by district-level committees\ncomprising \nrevenue,  panchayats,  APs  and\nnongovernment organizations (NGOs).\n\nrepresentatives  of  district  administration, \n\nG. \n\nImplementation of the RAP\n\n11. \nNHAI  will  engage  the  services  of  NGOs  to  provide  counseling  to  APs  and  assist  in\nimplementing  the  RAP,  particularly  in  disbursing  compensation  packages  as  prescribed  in  the\n\n\f58\n\nAppendix 11, page 3\n\nentitlement matrix. NGOs will play an important role in ensuring that legitimate grievances of the\nAPs are redressed and vulnerable groups among the APs are given special attention.\n\nRAP implementation, including land acquisition, will be completed within 18 months from\n\n12. \nthe start of the Project.\n\nH. \n\nRedress of Grievances\n\n13. \nGrievance redressal committees (GRCs) will be formed at each district. APs who have\ngrievances at any stage of implementation of the RAP may submit their grievances to the GRC.\nThe GRCs will comprise the project director (NHAI); district commissioner or his representative;\nAP/Project  displaced  persons  (PDPs)  local  representative;  resettlement  officer  (NHAI);\ncompetent  authority  for  land  acquisition;  NGO  representatives;  and  panchayat/village  level\nrepresentatives.\n\nI.\n\nBudget\n\nThe  budget,  which  includes  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  costs  and  services  of\n\n14. \nNGOs, is estimated at Rs750 million.\n\nJ. \n\nMonitoring and Evaluation\n\nMonitoring  will  be  continuous  throughout  implementation  of  the  RAP.  A  high-powered\n15.\ncommittee comprising of secretary-level officers of state and NHAI will monitor the functioning of\nthe  district-level  committees  and  GRCs  and  also  the  overall  implementation  of  the  RAP.  The\nPIU  will  submit  quarterly  progress  reports  to  the  NHAI  headquarters,  which  will  then  submit\nthem to ADB. Monitoring will be carried out for three years from the date of the implementation\nof the RAP.\n\nA  suitably  qualified  external  agency  will  be  hired  to  monitor  and  evaluate  the\n\n16.\nresettlement activities.\n\n\f59\n\nAppendix 12, page 1\n\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nFOR ENHANCING THE CORPORATE FINANCE CAPABILITY OF\nNATIONAL HIGHWAYS AUTHORITY OF INDIA\n\nA.\n\nBackground\n\n1.\nFaced  with  the  enormous  financing  needed  to  upgrade  a  13,000-kilometer  (km)  of\narterial  national  highway  network,  the  Government  of  India  decided  to  take  a  number  of  bold\npolicy actions to facilitate highway financing. The first major action was the establishment of a\ndedicated road fund (DRF) in 1998/99, which is expected to generate Rs20 billion ($444 million)\nper  annum  for  the  national  highway  segment.  To  maximize  the  leverage  of  the  fund  allocated\nfrom the DRF, the Government has further decided to let National Highways Authority of India\n(NHAI) to use the fund not only for direct payment for construction but also for debt services for\nbonds  issued  or  to  be  issued.  This  would  enable  NHAI  to  raise  approximately  six  times  more\nmoney from the capital markets compared with the direct use of DRF money. However, this, in\nturn, requires NHAI to mobilize funds from capital markets in a more aggressive and diversified\nmanner  (a larger scale and better terms).\n\n2.\nIn line with this Government decision, NHAI has already issued 7-year domestic bonds\nwith a put/call option after three years. The first issue, in 2000, raised Rs5 billion ($111 million)\nfor  NHAI.  The  second  bonds  were  issued  as  an  on-tap  issue  in  February  2001.  Both  issues\ncarry a triple A rating by virtue of their implicit government guarantee. There are plans for raising\nanother  approximately  Rs120  billion  ($2.5  million)  through  a  series  of  bond  issues.  While  the\nfirst  two  issues  were  made  through  private  placement,  subsequent  issues  may  need  to  be\nissued to a broader range of subscribers (public placement). These larger and sequential issues\nof bonds are likely to exceed the absorptive capacity of the domestic bond markets and would\ncause  crowding  out  of  other  institutions  from  Indian  markets.  Unless  NHAI  seeks  to  mobilize\nfunds from foreign capital markets, the current financing strategy may not be sustainable. NHAI\nshould  look  more  closely  at  the  possibility  of  issuing  bonds  in  offshore  markets  more  closely.\nThis  possibility  will  require  NHAI  to  disclose  more  financial  information  to  the  public  so  that\npotential investors can make informed decisions.\n\n3.\nWhile  this  direct  borrowing would bring a significant amount of funds to NHAI, it would\nstill  not  be  sufficient  to  implement  the  huge  tasks  mandated  by  the  Government.  It  will  be\nnecessary for NHAI to develop other methods of financing from the capital markets. NHAI has\nalready been pursuing build-operate-transfer schemes and has begun to explore the possibility\nof  securitizing  the  future  revenue  through  special-purpose  vehicles  (SPVs).  In  fact,  NHAI  has\nalready  established  several  SPVs  for  the  construction  of  highway  links  connecting  to  major\ntraffic  generators  such  as  ports.  It  plans  to  sell  its  shares  in  these  companies  once  they  have\ndemonstrated their revenue-generating capability.\n\n 4.\nThese  new  alternative  financial  instruments  should  be  implemented  under  an  overall\nfund  mobilization  strategy.  Over  the  longer  term,  NHAI  should  examine  alternative  forms  of\norganization that would enable it to pursue more sophisticated financing operations. The current\nform of NHAI (an operational arm of the government specializing in highway development and\nmaintenance) has imposed a number of constraints on its strategic option for fund mobilization.\nRelative  merits  and  demerits  of  the  current  and  alternative  forms  of  organizations  should  be\ncompared in a systematic manner so as to identify the most suitable form of organization, which\ncould effectively perform NHAI mission mandated by the Government.\n\n\f60\n\nAppendix 12, page 2\n\nB. \n\nTechnical Assistance\n\n1.\n\n Objective\n\n5.\nThe primary purpose of the proposed technical assistance (TA) is to strengthen the fund\nmobilization and financial management capability of NHAI. The study also aims to facilitate the\ntransformation  of  NHAI  into  a  more  efficient  and  autonomous  organization,  including  the\npossibility of corporatization.\n\n2.\n\nScope\n\n6.\nsequence.\n\nThe  proposed  TA  will  be  carried  out  in  two  stages  to  address  the  two  objectives  in\n\n7.\nThe first stage activities are designed to meet the NHAI\u2019s immediate need to strengthen\nits fund mobilization and financial management capabilities. More specifically, it would consist of\nthree  supports  for:  (i)  capital  mobilization;  (ii)  treasury  function;  and  (iii)  financial  reporting\nsystem:\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nSupport for facilitating capital mobilization. This component would assist NHAI in\ndeveloping  a  general  strategy  for  financing  road  investments  and  evaluating\nalternative  financial  instruments  both  currently  available  and  realizable  in  the\nmedium  term.  The  financial  instruments  currently  under  consideration  by  NHAI\ninclude:  special  purpose  vehicles  (SPVs),  bond  financing,  and  other  forms  of\nrevenue  securitization.  The  relative  costs  for  these  instruments  would  be\ndetermined  and  the  potential  size  of  the  market  for  these  instruments  would  be\nestimated.  Also  the  available  mechanisms  for  credit  enhancement  would  be\nexplored  including  different  forms  of  third  party  guarantees.  Criteria  and\nanalytical  procedures  would  be  developed  for  matching  road  projects  and\nfinancing options based on explicit objectives.  Based on these analyses, specific\nopportunities  would  be  identified,  and  then  specific  implementation  plans,\ndeveloped for each specific opportunity.\n\nSupport  for  enhancing  the  treasury  function.  This  component  would  aim  at\ndeveloping  a  strategy  for  placement  of  funds  to  maximizing  the  yield,  while\nensuring  adequate  liquidity.  Performance  measures  would  be  developed  to\nmonitor performance of the funds placement. This component would also aim at\nstrengthening its treasury function in a more general manner. The procedures for\ncollection of tolls revenues and payments for construction, service contracts, and\ndebt service would be reviewed to ensure both reliability in meeting obligations. A\nfinancial  planning  model  would  be  developed  in  which  alternative  investment\noptions  would  be  evaluated  along  with  the  projection  of  cash  flows  related  to\nconstruction  activities,  debt  financing,  government  grants  and  Cess  revenues\nand operating revenues and expenditures. The model would be used to evaluate\nvarious  allocation  of  funds  in  terms  of  liquidity  and  return  (which  would  also  be\nutilized for comparing various development scenario in the second stage study).\n\n(iii) \n\nSupport for upgrading the financial reporting system. This component will aim at\nstrengthening  NHAI\u2019s  accounting  and  financial  reporting  system.  Accounting\nstandards  and  policies  should  evolve  as  NHAI\u2019s  financing  operations  become\n\n\f61\n\nAppendix 12, page 3\n\nsophisticated.  Since  the  current  bond  issues  are  still  on  a  private  placement\nbasis, the current Government-regulated financial statements of NHAI have been\naccepted  by  the  market.  However,  as  the  scale  of  fund  mobilization  gets  larger\n(NHAI  should  consider  first  the  public  issuance  of  bonds  in  domestic  markets,\nthen issuance of bonds in offshore markets), accounting standards and policies,\ntogether  with  the  level  of  information  to  be  disclosed,  need  to  be  upgraded\naccording  to  the  road  map  for  modernization  of  accounting  standards  and\npolicies  (Appendix  8).  The  current  accounting  standards  and  policies  should\nmove to those consistent with, initially, Generally Accepted Accounting Practices\nof India (GAAP-I), and, then, with international accounting standards (IAS). The\nconsultant  should  assist  NHAI  in  its  process  through  (i)  reviewing  the  current\ngovernment  regulations  over  NHAI\u2019s  accounting  practices  and  developing\nrecommendations on the necessary modifications to them; (ii) reviewing possible\nfinancing operations and identifying required accounting standards and the level\nof  information  disclosure  for  each  type  of  financing  operations;  (iii)  developing\ntwo  sets  of  recommendations  necessary  for  NHAI\u2019s  accounting  standards  and\npolicies  to  be  upgraded  first  to  GAA-I,  and  then  to  IAS;  (iv)  adding  necessary\nmodification to computer models to be developed with World Bank assistance so\nthat  NHAI  can  produce  the  necessary  financial  statements  according  to  the\nadopted accounting standards and policies; and (v) training NHAI\u2019s staff to build\nthe necessary institutional capacity for accounting and financial reporting.\n\n8.\nThe  above  activities  would  be  preceded  by  the  review  of  the  current  legal  framework\nassociated  with  ownership  of  the  national  highways  (including  the  difference  between\n\u201centrusted\u201d, \u201cvested\u201d, \u201cleased\u201d, or \u201cowned\u201d). The above activities will be supplemented by foreign\nstudy tours to those countries such as the People\u2019s Republic of China that has introduced the\nsecuritization and raising additional development funds from the capital markets.\n\n9.\nThe second stage activities will focus on broader and longer term issues. A major topic\nwill  be  the  future  form  of  the  organization  with  particular  emphasis  on  how  to  transform  NHAI\ninto  an  efficiently  managed  and  financially/managerially  autonomous  body  such  as  a\ncorporatized organization. The main activities will be the following:\n\n (i) \n\nreview the results/progress of the World Bank study on institutional development;\n\n(ii) \n \n\n(iii) \n \n\n(iv) \n \n\n(v) \n \n\nreview the experiences of other countries with regard to forms of organizations that\nprovide infrastructure through the public sector operating arm;\n\nselect  possible  alternative  forms  of  organization  and  apply  the  strategic  financial\nplanning  model  to  compare  the  existing  and  alternative  forms  in  terms  of  financial\nperformance;\n\ndevelop  a  strategy  for  transforming  NHAI  into  an  efficiently  managed  and\nfinancially/managerially autonomous body; and\n\nhold a series of workshops on the future form of NHAI with participation of relevant\nagencies and the World Bank.\n\n\f62\n\nAppendix 12, page 4\n\n3. \n\nRequired Qualification\n\n10.\nDifferent  qualifications  are  required  for  the  first-  and  second-stage  activities.  The  first-\nstage  activities  requires  extensive  knowledge  on  (i)  capital  markets  both  in  India  and  in  other\ncountries;  (ii)  a  variety  of  financing  instruments  including  debenture,  securitization  of  future\nrevenue  flow,  special-purpose  vehicles,  and  initial  public  offer;  (iii)  the  treasury  function\nincluding  fund  management;  (iv)  accounting  policies  and  standards,  both  Indian  and\ninternational; and (v) legal aspects including real estate law and public sector ownership issue.\nFor the second-stage activities, extensive knowledge and experiences are required with regard\nto enterprise reforms, legal aspects of the Government organization and corporate law, and the\nprocess of corporatization.\n\nC. \n\nCost Estimates and Financing Plan\n\n11.\nThe  activities  will  be  carried  out  under  a  technical  assistance  associated  with  the\nWestern Transport Corridor Project and through international consulting firms and/or a group of\nindividual  consultants.

In  the  without-project  scenario,  the  existing  two-lane  alignment  was  used.\nCongestion would increase steadily until practical capacities were exceeded.  Traffic would then\nbe  diverted  to  available  alternative  routes.  In  the  with-project  scenario,  the  new  four-lane\nalignment  will  allow  improved  traffic  flow  conditions,  higher  vehicle  speeds,  and  shorter  travel\ntime translating into lower vehicle operating costs (VOCs). A six-lane scenario was considered,\nbut the projected growth in traffic was not sufficient to justify this investment within the next 10\nyears.  The  project  life  was  assumed  to  be  30  years  during  which  additional  capacity  will  be\nrequired.  For the purpose of economic analysis, growth in traffic was capped at the capacity of\nthe four-lane road, assuming that the additional traffic would be associated with the costs and\nbenefits of future investments.\n\nB.\n\nCosts\n\n2.   \nThe economic costs of implementing the Project were estimated from the financial costs\nof  civil  works,  physical  contingencies,  land  acquisition  for  the  right-of-way,  and  construction\nsupervision. The construction was assumed to require four years during which two of the four\nlanes  would  be  available.  Immediately  thereafter,  tolling  operations  would  begin.  Price\nescalation provisions, interest during construction, and taxes and duties were deducted from the\nfinancial costs to derive the economic costs. The financial costs were converted into economic\ncosts  by  using  the  factor  of  0.85  to  take  into  account  taxes  and  the  marginal  costs  for  labor.\nFinancial operation and maintenance (O&M) costs were also adjusted by the same approach to\nobtain economic costs.\n\n3.   \nBoth  alternatives  will  require  regular  maintenance  during  the  operation  of  the  Project.\nThe  maintenance  costs  were  calculated  as  the  difference  between  maintenance  requirements\nfor  the  new  four-lane  alignment  and  for  the  existing  two-lane  alignment  would  require.  The\nmaintenance  costs  for  the  new  road  are  higher  because  of  the  additional  two  lanes  and  the\nhigher  standard  of  road  construction  and  maintenance.  This  road  was  assumed  to  receive\nperiodic  maintenance  every  7  years  with  a  double  overlay  every  14  years.  The  existing  road\nwould receive a more frequent periodic maintenance, every three years, but with a lower quality\noverlay.  The  toll  road  will  incur  additional  operating  costs  for  toll  collection  and  traffic\nsupervision. All costs and benefits were estimated in constant October 2000 prices.\n\nC.\n\nBenefits\n\n4.   \nThe  principal  benefits  of  widening  to  a  four-lane  divided  highway  will  be  increased\ncapacity, low VOCs, and reduced travel time. Without the widening, traffic above the capacity of\nthe  two-lane  road  would  be  diverted  to  more  circuitous  routes,  if  alternatives  are  available,  or\nthe trips would not be made. Savings in VOC would be due to higher average operating speeds\nand reduced road roughness. The increase in speed is estimated to be about 20 kilometers per\nhour  for  buses  and  trucks  in  most  sections,  and  higher  for  automobiles.  The  higher  operating\nspeeds would reduce the VOC in terms of capital costs and the costs for drivers and assistants.\nRoad  roughness  would  be  greatly  reduced  because  the  volume  of  traffic  would  be  well  below\ncapacity  and  therefore  damage  would  be  less  substantial.    No  allowance  was  made  for  the\nadditional  reduction  in  roughness  due  to  better  quality  of  construction  and  maintenance\ndesigned for these roads.\n\n\f65\n\nAppendix 13, page 2\n\n5. \nConsidering vehicle and road characteristics, VOCs were calculated for six vehicle types\n(cars,  utility  vehicles/minibuses,  buses,  light  commercial  vehicles,  heavy  commercial  vehicles,\nand  multiaxle  vehicles).  The  values  were  calculated  using  a  variation  on  the  HDM-III  model\ndesigned  for  the  Indian  environment.  This  revised  model,  developed  under  an  earlier  Asian\nDevelopment Bank technical assistance, includes operating costs for vehicles common in Indian\nroads,  operating  speeds  commensurate  with  local  driving  habits,  and  road  deterioration\nrelationships based on experience with local roads. A sample of the vehicle costs computed for\nthe Tumkur-Sira section of the corridor are in Table A13.1.\n\nTable A13.1: Typical Operating Costs by Vehicle Type for Tumkur-Sira\n(Rs/vehicle-km)\n\nVehicle Type\n\nWithout Project\n\nWith Project\n\nVOC Savings\n\nCar\n\n3.78\n\n2.21\n\n1.57\n\nBus\n\nHCV\n\nMAV\n\n12.73\n\n13.06\n\n21.93\n\n6.44\n\n6.29\n\n7.21\n\n5.85\n\n14.87\n\n7.06\n\n   Car= new technology Car, HCV = heavy cargo vehicle, MAV = multiaxle vehicle.\n\n6.\nFor the without-project case, it was assumed that traffic on the road would continue to\ngrow and congestion increase until the practical capacity of the road was reached. At that point,\ntraffic would either be diverted to alternative routes, if these were available, or the trips would\nnot be made. In either case, the costs for the traffic that could not be accommodated would be\nequal  to  or  greater  than  the  cost  for  the  traffic  that  would  continue  to  travel  the  road.  It  was\nconservatively  assumed  that  the  benefits  to  this  traffic  would  be  the  difference  in  VOC  from\ntraveling on the four-lane road and traveling on the two-lane road when operating at capacity.\n\n7.\nThe VOC saving were substantially greater than the tolls as shown in Table A13.2. This\nsuggests that owners of commercial vehicles will be willing to pay not only tolls but also much\nhigher tolls.\n\nTable A13.2: Ratio of VOC Savings to Tolls\n\nVehicle Type\n\nVOC/Toll\n\nBuses\n\nLight Truck\n\nHeavy 2-Axle Truck\n\nMultiaxle Truck\n\n3.5\n\n6.7\n\n2.7\n\n2.0\n\n8.\nTime  savings  for  passengers  were  not  included  in  estimating  benefits.  A  separate\ncalculation  was  made  assuming  a  value  of  time  equal  to  one  half  the  average  wage  for\npassengers.  A  higher  income  was  assumed  for  automobile  passengers  than  for  bus\npassengers. These savings were found to add only about 4-5 percent to the economic internal\nrate  of  return  (EIRR).  However,  these  time  savings  are  important  for  automobile  passengers,\nsince  the  decision  to  use  a  tolled  road  is  presumably  based  on  time  savings  rather  than  on\n\n\f66\n\nAppendix 13, page 3\n\noperating  costs.1    The  same  applies  to  passengers  on  buses  in  their  choice  of  an  express\nservice. The comparison between tolls and time\nsavings  is  shown  for  Chitradurga-Davengere.\nThe average is about 1.60 for cars and 3.75 for\nbuses.  This  demonstrates \nif\npassengers  had  an  alternative  slower,  untolled\ntwo-lane route comparable with the current road,\nthey  would  prefer  to  take  the  tolled  road.  The\nratio  increases  as  the  traffic  level  increases\n(Figure A13.a).\n\nFigure A13.a: Ratio of Time Savings\nto Tolls\n\nthat  even \n\n4\n3.5\n\n4.5\n\no\n\n5\n\n3\n\ni\nt\na\nR\n\n2.5\n2\n\n0\n\n1.5\n\n2006\n\n2004\n\n2010\n\n2008\n\n1\n0.5\n\nA  number  of  benefits  were  not  included\n9. \nin  this  analysis:  reduction  in  freight  logistics\ncosts with reduction in travel time and the ability\nto  travel  at  convenient  times,  the  benefits  from\ngenerated  traffic,  and  reduction  in  accidents.\nThe  slow  travel  time  between  major  cities  limits\nthe growth in freight traffic. With increased travel\nspeeds, producers will have more options for outsourcing production, wholesalers and retailers\nwill be able to operate on tighter inventories and improve responsiveness to consumer demand,\nand transport operators will be able to rationalize the use of their fleets.  Some of these benefits\nare  captured  in  the  reduced  VOCs  but  the  benefits  that  result  from  structural  chains  in\nproduction  and  marketing  of  goods  and  improved  supply  chain  management  are  not.    One  of\nthese is the greater freedom in scheduling the time of travel. At present the traffic flow on the\ntwo-lane road is relatively constant throughout the day. Trucks prefer to travel at night partly due\nto the curfews in the major towns but also to avoid the other traffic on the roads. Intercity buses\nalso tend to travel at night. With an increase in road capacity, these trucks and buses will have\ngreater flexibility in choosing their travel times to meet the demands of their customers.\n\nAutomobiles\n\nBuses\n\n2012\n\n2014\n\nYear\n\n10. \nAlso  not  included  in  the  benefits  is  generated  traffic.  Freight  traffic  will  increase  as  the\nreduced travel time and cost allow producers to increase the size of the market in which they\ncan  compete.  Nonbusiness  passenger  traffic  will  increase  because  the  range  of  cities  and\ntowns  that  can  be  visited  on  nonwork  days  will  increase.  Business  trips  will  be  longer  as\ncommuting distances increase.  Little growth is expected from traffic diverted from other modes\nsince  rail  has  lost  most  of  its  market  to  road  transport  and  air  travel  remains  extremely\nexpensive.\n\n11. \nThe  savings  due  to  fewer  in  accidents  are  difficult  to  estimate  because  data  on  the\nnumber  and  type  of  accidents  occurring  along  the  western  transport  corridor  are  not  readily\navailable. An estimate prepared from statistics collected as part of an earlier national road user\ncost  study  produced  the  results  in  Table  A13.3.  The  reduction  in  different  categories  of\naccidents could not be predicted. However, the divided road will significantly reduce the number\nof head-on collisions, which were assumed to cause about one half of the fatalities and serious\ninjuries. The estimated value of the savings was smaller than the savings in VOCs. They would\nadd  only  about  1  percent  to  the  total  benefits.  The  savings  would  be  more  substantial  since\naccidents  tie  up  traffic  on  the  road  and  cause  significant  delays  throughout  the  year.\nFurthermore,  the  number  of  accidents  would  increase  as  the  two  lane  road  becomes  more\ncongested.  Finally,  the  value  associated  with  these  accidents  is  expected  to  increase  as  the\n\n                                                          \n1 Even out-of-pocket costs are difficult for road users to determine when comparing alternative routes.  Presumably\n\nthe decision to use tolled roads is based primarily on time savings.\n\n\f67\n\nAppendix 13, page 4\n\nvalues of vehicles, costs for injuries, and claims associated with loss of life rise faster than the\nrate of inflation. The savings will also be greater due to the efforts of NHAI to introduce better\nsafety  standards  and  to  enforce  laws  on  vehicle  operation.  These  factors  should  provide\nbenefits equal to 3-5 percent of the total.\n\nTable A13.3: Parameters for Accident Cost Estimates\n\nType of Accident\n\nOccurrence\n(per km-year)\n\nAverage Cost\n(Rs\u2019000)\n\nFatal Accident\n\nSerious Injury\n\nMinor Injury\n\nVehicle/Property Damage\n\n0.67\n\n0.31\n\n1.77\n\n4.05\n\n512.0\n\n80.0\n\n2.7\n\n25.0\n\n12. \nFor  estimating  the  EIRRs,  benefits  and  costs  were  calculated  for  30  years  starting  in\n2001. This period covers construction and economic life of the improvements under the Project.\nSeparate  sections  of  the  project  road  and  the  entire  Project  were  evaluated.  Because  of\nconsiderable uncertainty regarding to the project parameters, a simulation was prepared using\nthe  VOC  model.  The  parameters  that  were  treated  as  stochastic  included  the  forecasts  of\ngrowth in gross domestic product and population, the elasticity of passenger and freight traffic,\nthe  initial  traffic  volumes  (reflecting  problems  in  reliability  and  location  of  traffic  counts),  the\nchange  in  vehicle  mix  over  time  (for  both  freight  and  passenger  vehicles),  and  construction\ncosts.  The probability functions used are summarized in Table A13.4.\n\nTable A13.4  Probability Functions Used in Economic Analysis\n\nVariable\n\nPopulation Growth\n\nGDP Growth\n\nNotes\n\nBy 10-year period, Std.

The  high  values  for  all  sections  reflect  of  the  difficult  situation  currently\nprevailing on the road. The result of widening from two-lane undivided to four-lane divided will\nprovide more than a 200 percent increase in effective capacity and will convert the corridor from\none with relatively heavy, slow-moving traffic for significant portions of the corridor to one with\n\n\frelatively free-flowing traffic with adequate capacity to absorb the expected increase in traffic in\nthe next 10-15 years.\n\n68\n\nAppendix 13, page 5\n\nTable A13.5:  EIRR for Road Sections in Corridor\n(%)\n\n5% 95% Max\n\nSection\n\nTumkur-Sira\n\nRaniben Bypass\n\nHiriyur-Sira\n\nHiriyur- Chitradurga\n\nHaveri Widening\n\nHaveri  Bypass\n\nDavengere-Harihar\n\nChitradurga-Davengere\n\nTotal Road\n\n40\n\n25\n\n34\n\n35\n\n37\n\n30\n\n23\n\n30\n\n36\n\n48\n\n34\n\n40\n\n41\n\n43\n\n34\n\n27\n\n35\n\n38\n\n56\n\n43\n\n46\n\n47\n\n50\n\n39\n\n32\n\n41\n\n41\n\n  EIRR = economic internal rate of return.\n\nFigure A13.b: Distribution of Economic\nInternal Rate of Return\n\nThe  range  of  results  from  the\n14.\nsensitivity analysis are shown in Figure\nA13.b  for  the  total  road  project  and  in\nTable  A13.5  for  the  individual  road\nsections.

The  thrust  was  to  understand  and  measure  the\nthe  economically  and  socially\nimpact  of \nunderprivileged sections of the population, who generally constitute the poor and the very poor.\n\nthe  people,  particularly  on \n\nthe  Project  on \n\n2.\nThe Government of India recently launched a program to rapidly upgrade the entire road\nsystem comprising national highways (NH), state highways, and district and rural road networks.\nThe  Asian  Development  Bank\u2019s  (ADB's)  assistance  to  the  Western  Transport  Corridor  (WTC)\nProject is part of its contribution to the Government\u2019s overall efforts to upgrade the entire road\nnetwork. This study of the impact on poverty, therefore examined poverty impact issues from a\nbroader perspective, including the issue of rural connectivity and the project impact on the local\ncommunity including the scheduled caste (SC), scheduled tribe (ST), and women.\n\nC.\n\nThe Project Area\n\n3.\nThe 259-kilometer (km)-long Tumkur-Haveri highway is part of the NH4 in the southern\npart of India; it connects two major ports, Mumbai, and Chennai. Tumkur is situated 70 km north\nof Bangalore. The Tumkur-Haveri section starts at the north end of Tumkur (Km 75); traverses\nthe towns of Sira, Hiriyur, Chitradurga, Davangere, and Harihar; and ends on the north point of\nHaveri  town  (Km  340).  The  landscape  is  characterized  by  vast  stretches  of  undulating  plains\nwith  sporadic  ranges  of  low  rocky  hills.  Areas  are  basically  dry  with  occasional  rivers  running\nbetween hills. Most are open land often used as plantations and for other agricultural purposes.\nAround 5 percent of the land is forest area.  Project roads traverse a number of small towns and\nvillages.\n\nD. \n\nPoverty Profile\n\n4.\nAccording to the consultant\u2019s study conducted in 2000, poverty incidence in Karnataka is\n33.2  percent,  which  is  lower  than  the  national  average  (36.0  percent).1  Poverty  presents\ncomparatively  less  problems  in  Karnataka,  but  the  issue  is  the  intrastate  disparity  in  poverty\nlevel.

The\nlargest  population  of  the  poor  and  the  very  poor  are  SCs  and  STs  who  constitute  the  lowest\nrank  in  caste  hierarchy.  These  vulnerable  groups  of  the  society  are  physically  and  socially\nsegregated from main villages have limited access to basic amenities, which are by and large\nlocated in the main village. The time of SC/ST use of the commonly used amenities differs from\nthat of the dominant groups of the village.\n\nThe SCs and STs in the project districts account for 27.4 percent, which is higher than\n7.\nthe state average (21 percent). The poverty-related socioeconomic indicators (Table A14.3) are\nuniformly  higher  for  the  SC  and  ST  communities  regardless  of  the  extent  of  deprivation.\nAdequate  health  and  educational  infrastructure  related  to  the  socioeconomic  profile  of  the\nregion  is  both  a  cause  and  consequence  of  development.  The  principal  measures  of  health\nstatus  include  sex  ratio  and  life  expectancy  at  birth.  Educational  status  is  measured  using\nliteracy and enrollment rates. Issues of equity remain critical: access to these basic facilities is\nuneven across the state and gaps in related infrastructure are wide.\n\nTable A14.3 Socioeconomic Indicators of the Project Districts\n\nDistrict\n\nReal  GDP  per\ncapita (PPP$)\n\nLife\nExpectancy\n\nLiteracy\nMale\n\nLiteracy\nFemale\n\nTumkur\nHaveri\nDavangere\nChitradurga\nState Average\n\n60.64\n867\n62.78 a\n881\n61.92 b\n961\n61.92\n961\n62.07\n1135\nGDP = gross domestic product, PPP = purchasing power parity.\n\n66.5\n64.5\n66.8\n68.0\n66.5\n\n41.9\n39.4\n44.4\n43.3\n42.3\n\n1991\nSex\nratio\n959\n936\n942\n951\n960\n\n*Haveri was part of the old Dharwad district hence Dharwad data is used.\n\n       *Davangere was part of the old Chitradurga district, hence Chitradurga data is used.\n\nF. \n\nTransport and Poverty\n\nThe  NH4  is  primarily  used  for  interstate  traffic  connecting  the  major  cities  enroute  and\n8.\nalso for intrastate and local transport. The towns and villages located on the highway or close to\nit  necessarily  use  the  NH4  for  all  activities,  including  for  going  to  the  weekly  markets.  The\nvillages  and  towns  located  farther  away  from  the  NH4,  however,  are  connected  to  the  state\nhighway and the district roads. Often a section of the NH4 is used in commuting, particularly if\nthe commuters have to reach the district headquarters or the cities for their work. Maximum use,\nhowever, is by local traffic, popularly known as the route transport, connecting several villages\nto the taluk and district headquarters.\n\n9.\nIn the weekly markets, the communities purchase and sell commodities. Particularly for\nthe poor, these markets provide the space for exchange of goods. The weekly market days are\ntimed  soon  after  the  poor  receive  their  wages.  The  NH4  is  also  used  to  access  district/large\ntown  hospitals  for  emergency  health  care.  During  migration  in  search  of  employment\nopportunities  to  the  neighboring  cities  and  states,  the  poor  use  the  NH4.  In  most  districts  the\ncenters  of  higher  learning/vocational  training  centers  are  located  in  towns  and  district\nheadquarters; and therefore, increased connectivity will improve the access of the poor to these\ninstitutions. Vocational training centers are gaining popularity as they increase job opportunities\nfor the poor. Sometimes they are used for social and religious reasons.\n\n\f72\n\nAppendix 14, page 4\n\n10.\nRecognizing  the  importance  of  the  rural  road  network  to  link  villages  with  mainstream\ndevelopment, the Prime Minister recently announced an accelerated development program for\nrural  roads.  The  target  is  to  link  all  villages  with  population  of  more  than  1,000  to  major  road\nnetworks by all-weather roads by 2003 and those of more than 500 population by 2007.\n\nG. \n\nPoverty Programs\n\nThe  Government,  independently  as  well  as  with  bilateral  or  multi-lateral  sources  has\n11.\nundertaken various programs to address poverty. The most recent one is the special economic\nprograms  to  form  self-help  groups  among  rural  women.  The  idea  is  to  mobilize  women  and\nimprove  their  quality  of  life.  The  programs  for  reducing  poverty  are  in  four  broad  categories:\narea  development  programs,  special  economic  programs  (self-help  groups),  rural  energy\nprogram, rural water supply and sanitation programs.\n\n 12.\nThe  programs  have  good  objectives  but  face  serious  limitations.  In  most  cases,  the\nbenefits  arising  from  the  schemes  do  not  reach  the  most  deprived  sections  of  the  society  for\nthose reasons: information regarding the schemes is lacking; most of the infrastructure benefits\nare  both  spatially  and  socially  distant  from  them.  Poor  communication  networks,  including\nroads  and  the  irregular  and  limited  transport  facilities  aggravate  the  situation.  The  social\ndynamics  of  caste  and  class  hierarchies  along  with  unequal  gender  relations  are  major\nobstacles  in  the  flow  of  benefits  to  the  poor.  Lack  of  coordination  between  the  various\nimplementing  departments  of  the  government  and  other  organizations  prevents  the  schemes\nfrom reaching the marginalized. Hence, there is a need to create facilitating mechanisms, local\ncommunity networks, and, finally, the political will to ensure that the benefits reach the poor.\n\nH. \n\nCommunity-Based Assessment\n\nA  community-based  assessment  was  carried  out  in  nine  villages  located  at  varying\n13.\ndistances  from  the  highway  -  up  to  a  distance  of  25  km  on  either  side  -  and  representing  five\ndistricts:  Tumkur,  Chitradurga,  Davanagere,  Harihar  and  Haveri.  The  sample  comprised  332\npeople:  228  men  and  104  women.  To  collect  information  and  gain  insights  into  the  probable\nimpact  of  the  project  on  the  communities,  particularly  the  poor,  participatory  rural  assessment\ntechniques  were  used  These  are  interviews  with  primary  informants,  focus  group  discussions,\ntransect  walks,  participant  observation,  and  participatory  poverty  and  social  mapping.\nInformation was also collected from secondary sources.\n\n14.\n\nThe major findings are summarized below.\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nAll  sections  of  the  society  irrespective  of  caste  and  class  supported  the  project\nplan  to  broaden  the  NH4  corridor.  They  expected  the  project  to  make  a\nsignificant  impact  on  their  lives  by  raising  the  standard  of  living  and  reducing\npoverty in their villages.\n\nRoad  users  including  commercial  operators,  i.e.,  small  businessmen  and  mini-\ntransporters, viewed the broadening of the NH4 as leading to improved linkages,\nreduction in travel time, decrease in the number of accidents, lower maintenance\ncosts,  easier  commuting,  rise  in  income,  and  increased  opportunities  for\ninvestment.\n\n\f73\n\nAppendix 14, page 5\n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\nThe majority of the truck drivers, who are often individuals using trucks owned by\nothers and who are also generally classified poor, expected the higher number of\ntrips they make, lead to better social security, including compulsory insurance to\nbe borne by the truck owners.\n\nFor the agriculturists it meant improved transport linkages to big markets, leading\nto  higher  returns  for  their  produce,  increased  land  value,  and  a  change  in\ncropping pattern resulting in higher income. It also meant reduced cost of inputs\nand supplies, and transportation, that is efficient and safe.\n\nLocal communities expected benefits to accrue to them through better access to\neducation and job opportunities. Expanding economic opportunities for the poor\nmeans better bargaining power to negotiate for higher wages.\n\nFor  the  dalits  and  women,  the  project  will  positively  impact  their  livelihood  by\nimproving  their  access  to  basic  amenities  like  basic  education  and  adequate\nhealth  facilities,  easy  mobility,  better  employment  opportunities  with  increased\nwages, and easy access to markets. It will increase the opportunities for setting\nup production units to create alternative employment for unemployed youth and\nwomen.\n\nThe  poor  SC/ST  communities  within  the  village  are  often  hamlets/colonies\ngeographically  and  socially  remote  from  the  main  village.  They  expect  that,\nunless  conscious  efforts  are  made  to  integrate  them  into  the  developmental\nprocesses, they cannot enjoy the potential benefits to be created by a better road\nnetwork,  nor  access  to  various  developmental  programs  initiated  by  the\ngovernments.\n\n(viii)  Elected  representatives  and  local  leaders  were  positive  about  the  project  and\nexpected the flow of improved services from the government and other agencies.\n\nI. \n\nImpact on Poverty Reduction\n\n1. \n\nQuantitative\n\n15.\nThe poverty impact ratio was calculated, but due to limited information, the results of the\ncalculation  were  not  adequately  substantiated.  Instead,  more  specific  efforts  were  made  to\nquantify some impact of the Project on poverty.\n\n16.\nThe  construction  of  a  four-lane  road  between  Tumkur  and  Haveri  will  generate\nemployment for the population along the route. Unskilled labor will be employed directly in road\nconstruction  and  maintenance  and  indirectly  by  providing  material  and  services  to  the\nconstruction and maintenance activities. Unskilled labor for constructing a kilometer of the four-\nlane highway is estimated to amount to 2,175 person-days (Table A14.4). The road contractor\nwill bring along some of his unskilled labor from previous jobs, the rest will be obtained locally.\nThe percentage of local labor will depend on the cost to the contractor employing local labor. To\nreduce  this  cost  and  encourage  a  high  local  labor  component,  it  is  proposed  that  village\n\n\f74\n\nAppendix 14, page 6\n\norganizations be utilized to recruit labor and guarantee their performance.2 The additional labor\ngenerated  during  construction  will  prepare  materials  at  quarry  sites,  transport  materials  to  the\nsite, and provide food and other supplies for the workers. This is expected to add 33-50 percent.\n\nItem\n\nUnskilled Activity\n\nUnit\n\nTable A14.4: Unskilled Local Labor for Construction\n\nOutput/\nPerson-Day\n\nAverage\nquantity/km\n\nPerson-\ndays/km\n\nCutting, stacking,  carrying\n\nno.\n\n0.33\n\n77\n\n233\n\nTree felling and\nCutting\n\nDemolishing\nbuildings\n\nDemolishing\nbridges\n\nSorting demolished materials\n\nsq.\n\nSorting demolished materials m3\n\nTack coat\n\nClear surface\n\n100\n\n20,000\n\nConcrete\n\nCleaning formwork, watering\n\n10\n\n0.5\n\n10\n\n4\n\n2\n\n5\n\n2\n\n1\n\n10\n\n1\n\n20\n\n520\n\n90\n\n1,000\n\n1,050\n\n50\n\n100\n\n250\n\n50\n\n1,400\n\n300\n\n1,900\n\n52\n\n180\n\n200\n\n250\n\n525\n\n5\n\n20\n\n125\n\n50\n\n140\n\n95\n\n95\n\nm2\n\nm3\n\nton\n\nm2\n\nm2\n\nm3\n\nm3\n\nm2\n\nm3\n\nm\n\nReinforcement\n\nCarrying, holding, tieing\n\nMastic coat to deck Cleaning, carrying\n\nPaving flags\n\nCarrying, mixing, tidying\n\nErosion apron\n\nCarrying, mixing, tidying\n\nStone pitching\n\nCarrying, mixing,\nTidying\n\nTopsoil\n\nSpreading, leveling\n\nMasonry wall\n\nCarrying, mixing,\nTidying\n\nFencing\n\nCarrying, tidying\n\n  m = meter.\n\n17.\nThe contractors responsible for road operation and maintenance will also require casual\nunskilled labor on a continuing basis for routine maintenance of the pavement, shoulders, and\nassociated civil works.  The level of employment will be lower but over a longer period, and will\ninvolve  a  higher  proportion  of  local  labor.  It  is  estimated  that  the  average  annual  level  of\nemployment will be 2-3 person-years per km. In addition, there will be another 3-4 person-years\nevery seven years when periodic maintenance is conducted.\n\n2  Contractors are often reluctant to use local labor because they are viewed as unreliable.\n\n                  \n\n\f75\n\nAppendix 14, page 7\n\n18.\nThe  annual  amount  of  unskilled  labor  required  by  the  Project  is  expected  to  be  about\n1,000  person-years  during  construction  and  750  person-years  thereafter.  The  distribution  of\nthese  jobs  between  the  local  residents  above  and  below  the  poverty  line  will  depend  on  the\nrecruitment effort. If equally distributed according to the population breakdown, this will amount\nto about 400 person-years during construction and 300 person-years thereafter for those below\nthe poverty line.\n\nIn addition, considerable secondary employment will be generated to meet the needs of\n19.\nexpanded  transport  activity.  This  will  mean  expanding  of  services  for  truck  drivers  and  bus\npassengers by including restaurants, fueling and vehicle repair facilities, and parking areas.\n\n2.\n\nQualitative\n\n20.\nThe  principal  benefit  to  the  rural  populations  in  the  project  area  is  the  opportunities\nprovided through increased connectivity. However, the breadth of these benefits will depend on\nthe development of the rural road network. These roads are not in good condition and often do\nnot reach the poorest villages. The fuel taxes used to fund the NHAI development program will\nalso provide funds for developing of the rural network. This will allow the more isolated villages\nto be better connected to the taluk and district centers as well as the major cities. The benefits\nwill be substantial since the economic isolation of many of the poorer villages along the project\nroute will end.\n\n21.\nImproved  transportation  will  improve  the  distribution  of  social  services  from  the\nKarnataka government to the villages along the project road. This will include better support for\nthe  local  medical  clinics  and  educational  facilities.  At  the  same  time,  village  access  to  the\nhospitals and health-care facilities in the large towns and district centers for emergency health\ncare will improve.\n\n22.\nThe  communities  located  along  and  close  to  the  NH4  use  it  for  visiting  the  weekly\nmarket,  where  they  buy  and  sell  commodities.  These  markets  provide  the  poor,  the  space  for\nexchange  of  goods.  Market  days  are  timed  soon  after  the  poor  receive  their  wages.  The\nreduction  in  transport  costs  and  travel  time  will  allow  the  poor  to  seek  employment  in\nneighboring cities and states.\n\n23.\nIn  most  districts  the  centers  of  higher  learning/vocational  training  centers  are  in  towns\nand  district  headquarters.  Increased  connectivity  will  improve  access  to  vocational  training\ncenters,  which  increase  job  opportunities  for  the  poor.  Centers  are  sometimes  used  for  social\nand religious purposes.\n\n24.\nApproximately  three-quarters  of  the  local  workforce  are  currently  engaged  in  either\nagriculture or some form of manufacturing/processing. The road also offers a better connection\nto central markets for the sale of local agricultural and other resources.\n\nJ.\n\nConclusion\n\n25.\nThe  immediate  project  benefits  that  will  accrue  to  the  poor,  who  struggle  for  their\nlivelihood  on  a  day-to-day  basis  will  not  be  a  large  portion  of  the  total  benefits  to  the  rural\npopulation.    This  is  not  surprising,  given  the  level  of  the  poor\u2019s  participation  in  rural  economic\nactivity; however, the benefits will increase substantially over time. The short-term, immediate,\nvisible  benefits  are  better  articulated  and  include  construction  works,  maintenance  works,  tree\n\n\f76\n\nAppendix 14, page 8\n\nplanting,  provision  of  services,  etc.,  that  offer  immediate  income-earning  opportunities  to  the\nrural poor. The wage income emanating from agriculture fluctuates over time due to seasonality\nof  operations.  However,  the  project  will  generate  ample  employment  opportunities  for  skilled\nand unskilled labor during its implementation phase. The project will have positive externalities,\nwhich will improve the livelihood of the poor.\n\n26.\nMore  important  are  the  long-term  impacts  of  the  project,  which  include  the  narrowing\ndown of intradistrict disparities and reduction of poverty. Providing the poor with better access\nto  services and economic opportunities available in the larger towns and cities is a necessary\ncondition for economic development of poor communities. An improved road network, including\nprimary  and  feeder  roads,  will  increase  economic  opportunities  for  the  poor,  the  unemployed\nyouth,  and  women.  It  will  also  augment  the  inflow  of  social  benefits  such  as  access  to  better\nhealth services, education, and other public services.\n\n\f", "author_pages": ["CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS\n(as of 15 August 2001)\n", "Currency Unit\nRe1.00\n$1.00\n", "\u2013\n=\n=\n", "Rupee/s (Re/Rs)\n$0.0212\nRs47.13\n", "In this report, an exchange rate of $1.00 = Rs44 was used for\n", "calculation purposes.
