An  initial  environmental  examination  and \nAssessment  environmental impact assessment were prepared. The Project\u2019s \noverall  environmental  effects  are  positive.  It  will  (i)  improve \nsurface  and  groundwater  quality,  including  marine  waters,  by \nreducing untreated and partially treated sewage discharges to the \nenvironment; (ii) improve public health by reducing sewage and \ndecreasing flooding; and (iii) reduce solid waste to urban streams \nand marine waters by improving drainage system management. \nAn  environmental  assessment  for  the  overall  Project  was \nprepared and approved by the Planning and Urban Management \nAgency  and  is  updated  periodically  to  reflect  refinements  of \ncomponent  designs  and  environmental  monitoring  and \nmanagement plans. \n   \nProject Description  The Project will provide (i) improved drainage and floodways in \nApia\u2019s Fugalei area; (ii) a sewerage system including pressure \nsewers and a wastewater treatment plant to service the low-lying \ncentral  business  area  and  special  needs  areas  including  the \nNational  Hospital,  Malifa  Education  Compound,  commercial \nproperties  located  at  Beach  Road,  and  Fugalei  Market;  (iii)  a \nseptic  tank  maintenance  and  replacement  program  to  service \napproximately 8,000 households within the greater Apia area; and \n(iv)  strengthened  institutions  for  wastewater  management, \ndrainage, urban management, and environmental monitoring. \n   \nRationale  In greater Apia, which has a population of approximately 60,000, \n75% of households have septic tank systems, but many are too \nsmall, rarely cleaned, and in some instances discharge directly to \nthe nearest drainage channel, thus polluting groundwater, surface \nstreams, and the harbor. In the central business area and special \nneeds areas\u2014those with special wastewater concerns such as \nhospitals  and  major  school  compounds\u2014less  than  10%  of \nwastewater is adequately treated. The hospital has ineffective on-\nsite sewage treatment facilities as do most commercial centers \nand government complexes. The situation is exacerbated by the \nhistorical  lack  of  urban  management  and  absence  of  effective \ntown  planning,  development  controls,  and  adequate  urban \ndrainage and wastewater infrastructure. Flooding after heavy rain ", "ii       \nis intensified and foul-water flooding poses a health risk due to the \nrelease of septage and latrine wastes to the surface environment. \nInadequate sanitation and wastewater management systems have \nsignificantly degraded nearshore marine water and urban stream \nwater quality in Apia.  \n \nSamoa  is  vulnerable  to  natural  disasters.  Severe  floods  were \nreported in 1939, 1975, 2001, and 2003. In addition, localized \nflooding occurs annually. The 2001 flood damage was estimated \nat $4.4 million in 2001 prices. About 5,000 people were directly \naffected  by  the  flooding  and  about  28,000  experienced  water \nshortages. Businesses were forced to close as the water supply \nnetwork  was  damaged.  Other  impacts  included  the  spilling  of \nseptic tanks with resulting environmental and health impacts. \n \nFollowing a request by the Government in February 2003, the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  approved  the  Sanitation  and \nDrainage Project (the Project) for SDR5.604 million ($8 million \nequivalent) on 27 November 2003. Following detailed design and \nbidding for the larger project components, the Government asked \nADB to provide supplementary financing to help meet anticipated \ncost overruns of $7.8 million. The Government informed ADB that \nit  was  unable  to  reduce  the  scope  of  the  Project  without \ncompromising the project goals, and could not finance the cost \noverrun  from  its  own  resources  due  to  fiscal  constraints.  The \nGovernment also informed ADB that it had sought the assistance \nof other international development partners to help meet the cost \noverrun through grants. \n   \nImpact and Outcome  The Project will contribute to a high standard of environmental \nquality and public health for Apia. Outcomes of the Project will be \neffective  and  sustainable  sewage  collection  and  treatment \nsystems, and less frequent and severe floods in Apia, through the \nprovision of adequate wastewater and drainage infrastructure, and \neffective wastewater and drainage planning and management. \n   \nProject Investment Plan   The revised project cost estimate is $17.81 million, including taxes \nand duties of $2.17 million.  \n   \nSupplementary  A loan in various currencies equivalent to Special Drawing Rights \nFinancing Plan  1,710,000 ($2,780,000 equivalent) will be provided from ADB\u2019s \nSpecial Funds resources with an interest charge at the rate of \n1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum \nthereafter; a term of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years; \nand  such  other  terms  and  conditions  as  are  substantially  in \naccordance with those set forth in the draft Financing and Project \nAgreements. In addition, a grant of $2,220,000 will be provided \nfrom ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources to ease the macroeconomic \nimpact of the financing requirements for cost overruns.

The Government will relend a portion of the loan and \ngrant to the Samoa Water Authority (SWA). The relending will \nhave a 30-year term, including a grace period of 5 years, and an \ninterest  rate  of  5%  per  annum,  and  such  other  terms  and \nconditions set forth in the subsidiary financing agreement between \nthe  Government  and  SWA.  An  amendment  to  the  existing \nSubsidiary  Loan  Agreement  will  reflect  the  supplementary \nfinancing and the conditions in the supplementary financing and \nproject  agreements.

Project review \nmissions will continue to be undertaken on a 6-monthly basis. \n   \nExecuting Agency  Ministry of Finance \n   \nProcurement  The equipment, material, and works financed by the proceeds of \nthe loan and grant will be procured in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). \n   \nConsulting Services  Project  management  unit  (PMU)  and  project  implementation \nassistance (PIA) consultants were recruited in November 2004 \nand  May  2006,  respectively.  The  PMU  consultants\u2019  contract \nexpired  on  30  June  2008  and  the  PIA  consultants\u2019  contract \nexpires on 31 December 2008. The PMU and the PIA consultants \nhave  performed  well  and  their  services  are  needed  for  the \nduration  of  project  implementation.  The  PMU  and  the  PIA \nconsultants will be recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines \non the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time) \nusing single source selection.  \n   \nProject Benefits and  Urban Apia currently lacks an efficient drainage system. Severe \nBeneficiaries  floods have caused major damage to structures and disruptions to \neconomic  activity,  directly  affecting  business,  most  of  the \n ", "iv       \npopulation in Apia, and the overall economy. In addition, localized \nflooding occurs annually. This situation is compounded by a lack \nof  an  efficient  and  centralized  system  for  wastewater \nmanagement.  The  Samoa  Country  Environmental  Analysis \nidentified the need to address the high solid waste generation and \ninadequate  waste  management  practices.  The  Project  will \nimprove Apia\u2019s environment and public health. \n \nThe  economic  analyses  on  the  drainage  and  floodway,  and \nwastewater  components  were  reappraised  to  include  cost \noverruns as a result of factors associated with implementation \ndelays. Benefits for the drainage and floodway component are \nquantified in terms of avoided costs of damage resulting from \nflooding. The internal economic rate of return is 13.2%. Benefits \nfor the centralized sewerage system are quantified in terms of \ncost savings as compared to the alternative investment scenario \nof using individual sewerage systems. The internal economic rate \nof return is 16.5%. The results are robust with respect to changes \nin key assumptions and risks. \n   \nRisks and Assumptions  Further delays and project cost increases are not expected as \nmajor contracts have been awarded and bid documents for all \nother contracts have been completed.  \n \nThe Government has demonstrated its commitment to the Project \nand overall urban management through the establishment of the \nPlanning and Urban Management Agency, promulgation of the \nPlanning and Urban Management Bill, and efforts to develop the \nProject.  Draft  sewerage  regulations  have  been  prepared.  The \nCabinet is expected to endorse the Sewerage Regulations by 30 \nSeptember 2008. \n \nThe commitment to improve cost recovery and sustainability is \nevidenced  by  the  recent  approval  of  water  tariff  increases, \nenactment  of  the  public  bodies  bill  to  promote  sustainable \ncommercial operations for public enterprises, and review of the \nProject\u2019s  cost-recovery  issues.  Cabinet  endorsement  of  cost-\nrecovery mechanisms for the sewerage system and the septic \ntank  maintenance  and  replacement  program  is  a  condition  for \neffectiveness of supplementary financing. \n \n ", "172 o 40'W 171o  30'W\nSAMOA 13F o a30le'SalupSoatauaMatavaSiafSotaufuneFagamaSloamalaeulu 13 o 30'S\nFalelima Pu'apu'a S A M O A\nSANITATION AND SAVAI'I  ISLAND\nFaga\nDRAINAGE PROJECT\nSalailua Palauli Tuasivi\nSalelologa PROJECT AREA\nTaga Fale'ula\nSatupaitea Mulifanua\nApolima Faleolo APIA\nManono Satapuala Fusi\nSolosolo Fale17f1ao  30'W\nFalelatai UPOLU   ISLAND Tiavea\nN 14 o 00'S Matautu Salani 14 o 00'S\nSiumu Poutasi LotofagaLalomanu\nP  A  C  I  F  I  C      O  C  E  A  N\n0 250 500\n172 o 40'W 171o  30'W\nMeters\n171 o 45'W\nP A C I F I C    O C E A N\nDrainage Improvement Work\nNational Capital\nCity/Town\nWastewater Treatment Plant\nFloodway Improvement Work\nPressure Sewers\nWastewater Treatment Plant Site National Road\nOther Road\nRiver\nV a i u s u    B a y\nMatauta\nC APIA\naseca APIA HARBOUR\nse R\nVailoa iver\ner\nLepea Vaiosu Riv Vaimoso Fugalei Asaga Stream VaisiganoRiverNiue Fogavai\nTufuiopa\nTulaele\n13 o 50'S Mulivai River Malifa 13 o 50'S\nLotopa\nVaivasetai\nMotootua\nMagiagitai\nSinamoga\n171 o 45'W\n08-1875 HR", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nsupplementary loan, and (ii) a proposed grant, both to the Independent State of Samoa for the \nSanitation and Drainage Project. \n \nII.  INTRODUCTION \n2.  Following  a  request  from  the  Government  of  Samoa  in  February  2003,  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) approved a loan for the Sanitation and Drainage Project (the Project). \nThe loan for SDR5.604 million ($8 million equivalent) was approved on 27 November 2003.1 \nThe request followed implementation of a technical assistance (TA) project2 for urban planning \nand management that identified infrastructure investments to improve the environmental quality \nof  Apia.  The  Project  is  the  first  phase  of  a  longer-term  urban  drainage  and  wastewater \nimprovement strategy. The loan and project agreements were signed on 1 June 2004 and the \nloan became effective on 30 August 2004. \n \n3.  After detailed design and bidding for the project components with the largest expected \ncost, the Government asked ADB to provide supplementary financing to cover anticipated cost \noverruns. The Government informed ADB that it was unable to reduce the project scope without \ncompromising the project goals, and could not finance the cost overrun from its own resources \ndue to fiscal constraints. The Government also informed ADB that it was seeking the assistance \nof other international development partners to help meet the cost overrun through grants. The \nEuropean Union (EU) has approved grant financing for the construction of a wastewater sludge \ntreatment facility and for stream-flow gauging and flood modeling to assist the Government in \nmeeting the project cost overrun. The EU grants, which will be provided as parallel financing, \nhave reduced the estimated cost overrun by approximately $2.1 million from $9.91 million to \n$7.81 million. With the exception of the sludge treatment facility and the stream-flow gauging \nand flood modeling, which will now be financed by the EU, the project scope is unchanged. The \ncost  overrun  is  due to an increase in the original cost estimates.  The  revised  design  and \nmonitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n4.  As  a  result  of  increased  economic  activity  and  population  growth,  the  pressure  on \ndrainage and waste water infrastructure in Apia has become more critical. The economic, \nhealth, and environmental impacts of flooding and wastewater to the Apia community are now \nmore severe than in 2003 when the Project was approved. Efficient and effective drainage and \nwastewater systems in Apia are urgently required. The Project remains highly relevant and \nsupports the Government\u2019s water sector strategy.3 The Strategy for the Development of Samoa \n2008\u20132010 identifies the provisions of efficient and effective utility service and infrastructure as \nessential elements for economic growth, and specifically identifies the Project to help meet key \ndevelopment objectives. \n \n5.

THE APPROVED PROJECT \nA.  Project Rationale \n6.  In greater Apia, which has a population of approximately 60,000, 75% of households \nhave septic tank systems; but many are too small, rarely cleaned, and in some instances \ndischarge directly to the nearest drainage channel, polluting groundwater, surface streams, and \nthe  harbor.  In  the  central  business  area  and  special  needs  areas\u2014those  with  special \nwastewater  concerns  such  as  hospitals  and  major  school  compounds\u2014less  than  10%  of \nwastewater is adequately treated. The hospitals have ineffective on-site sewage treatment \nfacilities  as  do  most  commercial  centers  and  government  complexes.  The  situation  is \nexacerbated by the historical lack of urban management and the absence of effective town \nplanning, development controls, and adequate urban drainage and wastewater infrastructure. \nIndividuals have elevated their plots heights, reclaimed land in the mangrove area, and blocked \nnatural drainage paths. Flooding after heavy rain is intensified and foul-water flooding poses a \nhealth risk due to septage and latrine wastes being released to the surface environment.4 \n \n7.  Inadequate  sanitation  and  wastewater  management  systems  have  significantly \ndegraded  nearshore  marine  water  and  urban  stream  water  quality  in  Apia.  Water  quality \nmonitoring  data5 confirms  sewage  contamination  as  evidenced  by  low  dissolved  oxygen \nsaturation,  high  biochemical  oxygen  demand,  high  total  nitrogen  concentration,  and  high \nindicator bacteria concentration. Urban drains are often choked with litter and vegetation, foul \nsmelling\u2014indicating anaerobic conditions\u2014and contain floating oil and sewage. Drains and \nnatural watercourses are contaminated with sewage and, occasionally, industrial waste. \n \n8.  Samoa is vulnerable to natural disasters. Severe floods were reported in 1939, 1975, \n2001, and 2003. In addition, localized flooding occurs annually. Damage of the 2001 flood was \nestimated at $4.4 million6 comprising $1.3 million in damage to infrastructure and $3.1 million of \ninsurance payout for mainly commercial damage. The actual costs are likely to be considerably \nhigher as most individual households do not have insurance. About 5,000 people were directly \naffected by the flooding and about 28,000 experienced water shortages. Businesses were \nforced to close as the water supply network was damaged. Other impacts included the spilling \nof septic tanks with resulting environmental and health impacts. \n  \nB.  Objectives and Scope \n9.  The overall objective of the Project is to improve Apia\u2019s environment and public health \nthrough improved drainage and sanitation infrastructure, and capacity in urban management. \nProject  objectives  include  (i)  improve  public  health,  (ii)  improve  environmental  quality,  \n(iii) improve surface and groundwater quality, and (iv) reduce frequency of flooding in specific \nlow-lying  areas.  A  special  feature  of  the  Project  is  private  sector  participation  through \n                                                 \n4  Septage is the discharge from on-site wastewater treatment facilities such as septic tanks and pit latrines. \n5  Monitoring is done infrequently and usually initiated through donor-funded activities. ADB provided assistance to \nwater monitoring through (i) ADB. 2003. Technical Assistance to the Independent State of Samoa for Drainage and \nWastewater Management. Manila; (ii) ADB. 1995.

", "  3\noutsourcing of the operation and maintenance (O&M) of drainage and wastewater services to \nthe private sector. The Project also contributes to private sector development through the \nprovision of improved urban infrastructure and environment for businesses. \n \n10.  The Project has three components: drainage and floodways, wastewater management \nand sanitation, and capacity building. Project outputs include (i) drainage and floodways; (ii) \nrehabilitated  drains;  (iii)  installation  of  water  gauges  for  flood  monitoring;  (iv)  design, \nconstruction, and operation of a wastewater collection and treatment system; (v) utility-managed \nindividual sanitation systems; and (vi) strengthened institutions for wastewater management, \ndrainage, urban management, and environmental monitoring. \n \n11.  The  drainage  and  floodways  component  mitigates  flooding  of  the  Gasegase  River, \nAsaga Stream Bypass, and Fugalei Stream area to the southwest of the central business area, \nand provides data required for the development of a broader drainage management plan to \nguide future improvements. The scope of the drainage and floodways component includes: (i) \ndesign and channel improvement works, including de-silting, channel realignment, and bank \nstabilization, for: (a) approximately 900 meters (m) of the Gasegase River down stream of the \nVaimoso Bridge; (b) approximately 450 m of the Asaga Stream from Fugalei Street to the \nconfluence of the Gasegase River; and (c) 850 m length of the Asaga Bypass Stream from \nFugalei  Street  to  the  confluence  of  the  Gasegase  River;  (ii)  design  and  construction  of \napproximately 2,570 m of pipe drains with internal diameters ranging from 450 mm to 1,600 \nmm; (iii) rehabilitation,  including  removal  of  debris  and  bank  stabilization, of approximately \n360 m of existing open drain; (iv) installation of water gauging stations to monitor flood flows \nand provide data for hydraulic modeling and further drainage design (to be funded by the EU); \nand  (v)  undertaking  topographical  and  cadastral  surveys  to  establish  correct  levels  in  the \nfloodplain and low-lying area and hydraulic modeling of flood flows (to be funded by the EU). \nThe topographical and cadastral surveys will establish levels in the floodplain and low-lying \nareas, support hydraulic modeling of flood flows, and guide the design and implementation of \ncivil works. \n \n12.  The  wastewater  management  and  sanitation  component  addresses  the  immediate \nwastewater and sanitation needs in urban Apia through the following components: \n \n(i)  Individual System Rehabilitation and Septage Collection and Treatment Program \nincluding (a) implementation of the Septic Tank Rehabilitation and Replacement \nProgram including the provision of septage collection services and repair and \nreplacement of septic tanks to approximately 8,000 households in the Greater \nApia area; and (b) a detailed sanitary survey; and (c) a sludge treatment facility to \nbe located at the Tafaigata landfill (to be funded by the EU); and \n \n(ii)   CBA  and  SNA  Sewerage  System  including:  (a)  design  and  construction  of \napproximately  8,450  m  of  pressure  sewers  inclusive  of  all  sewage  pumps, \ntraining of SWA personnel for systems maintenance, and an extended defects \nliability period of 540 days; and (b) design, construction, and operation of a \nsequencing batch reactor wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) at Sogi, inclusive \nof  effluent  disinfection  facilities,  with  an  nominal  treatment  capacity  of \n1,000 m3/day. \n \n13.  The capacity development component provides capacity development in technical and \nmanagement areas as well as community awareness programs. Capacity development will \nmainly be provided to SWA; Ministry of Works, Transport, and Infrastructure (MWTI); and \n ", "4     \nPlanning and Urban Management Agency (PUMA) for (i) capacity building in technical and \nmanagement  areas  through  identifying  training  needs  and  developing  training  programs; \n(ii) assistance for establishment and conduct of a twinning arrangement for SWA with a well-\nfunctioning wastewater utility, or similar organization; (iii) community awareness programs in the \nkey  areas  such  as  (a)  need  for  new  infrastructure  and  new  practices,  including  the \nenvironmental implications of unsafe sanitation and drainage practices, (b) application of good \non-site  planning  principles  and  practices  for  sanitation  and  drainage,  (c)  on-site  sanitation \ndesign, operations and maintenance, including where to seek technical assistance and advice, \n(d) the responsibilities of Government, households and individuals in regard to sanitation and \ndrainage, (e) safe wastewater practices; and (iv) Project implementation assistance. \n \nC.  Cost Estimates \n14.  The project investment cost was estimated at $10 million, excluding taxes and duties \n(Table 1).

Financing Plan \n15.  Following the Government\u2019s request, ADB approved a loan of $8 million equivalent from \nADB\u2019s Asian Development Fund (ADF). The loan has a 32-year term including a grace period of \n8 years, an interest rate of 1.0% during the grace period and 1.5% thereafter, and such other \nterms and conditions set forth in the loan and project agreements. The beneficiary is the \nIndependent State of Samoa. The loan was approved on 27 November 2003 and became \neffective on 30 August 2004. A portion of the loan ($3.5 million equivalent) is relent by the \nGovernment to SWA. The relending has a 32-year term including a grace period of 5 years, and \ninterest of 5% per annum, and other such terms and conditions set forth in the subsidiary \nfinancing agreement between the Government and SWA. The Government assumes the foreign \nexchange risk and provides $2.0 million equivalent in local currency as counterpart financing. \nThe financing plan is shown in Table 2. \n \n \n ", "  5\nTable 2: Original Financing Plan \n($ million) \n \nSources Exchange  Total  Percent \nAsian Development Bank  8.0  80 \nGovernment  2.0  20 \nTotal  10.0  100 \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Project Management \n16.  The Ministry of Finance (MOF) is the Executing Agency. A project steering committee \n(PSC), established in January 2005, serves as a joint water sector steering committee to \nprovide guidance and oversight of water sector projects. Members of the joint PSC include the \nchief executive officers of MOF, MWTI, Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment, Ministry \nof Health; Ministry of Agriculture, Ministry for Women, Community and Social Development, the \ngeneral managers of the Electrical Power Corporation and the Samoa Water Authority (SWA); a \nrepresentative from the Samoa Umbrella Non Government Organization, and the Sanitation and \nDrainage Project and Water Sector Support Program project management unit (PMU) project \nmanagers.7 A subcommittee, which meets on a monthly basis, was formed to provide technical \ndirection for the Project. The implementing agencies are MWTI for the drainage and floodway \ncomponent,  and  SWA  for  the  wastewater  management  and  sanitation  component.  PUMA \nremains directly engaged in both components as part of its responsibility for urban management \nand planning. \n \n17.  The PMU is staffed by a Samoan consulting firm, and coordinates project activities; \nmonitors overall project progress; and manages project accounts, procurement, and reporting. It \nreports directly to the PSC. The PMU has been effective and efficient in its coordination, \nmonitoring, and management of the Project. \n \n2.  Implementation Period  \n18.  Project implementation is delayed by about 24 months. At appraisal, the Project was \nenvisaged  to  be  implemented  over  2.5  years,  commencing  in  March  2004.  The  Project \neffectively commenced in November 2005 when the PMU consultants were fielded. The Loan \nAgreement  specified  a  loan  closing  date  of  30  June  2009.  The  implementation  delay  is \nattributed to a number of factors including delay in loan signing, late recruitment of project \nimplementation assistance (PIA) consultants, and the need to rebid major contracts. Despite \ninitial delays, project progress is satisfactory. Overall project progress is estimated at 42% as \ncompared to the overall elapsed period of project implementation of 77%. A chronology of \nsignificant project events is in Appendix 2. \n  \n3.  Procurement \n19.  Procurement of the Project\u2019s major components is complete. Contracts for the drainage \nand floodways, and pressure sewers have been awarded. The contract for the WWTP was \nsigned on 30 May 2008. Bidding for the contracts followed international competitive biding \n                                                 \n7  The Water Sector Support Program, funded by the EU, supports water supply and sanitation development in \nSamoa\u2019s rural areas. \n ", "6     \nmethods using the standard ADB Plant-design, supply, and install bid documents. A rebidding \nprocess was undertaken for the floodway and drainage, pressure sewers, and WWTP contracts \nas bids were either noncompliant or included excessive bid prices. ADB has approved financing \nof $7.52 million for contract awards as of 6 May 2008. \n \n4.  Consulting Services \n20.  To strengthen project management of the implementing agencies and PUMA, PMU \nconsultants were engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \n(2007, as amended from time to time). The PMU consultants were fielded in November 2005. \nPIA consultants were appointed in February 2006 to help the implementing agencies design and \nimplement the project components.8 \n \n5.  Disbursement Arrangements \n21.  The loan proceeds are being disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement \nHandbook (2007, as amended from time to time). An imprest account for the Project was \nestablished after loan effectiveness. Replenishment of the imprest account is supported by \nwithdrawal  applications  and  related  documentation.  The  statement  of  expenditure  (SOE) \nprocedures applies to reimbursement for eligible expenditures and liquidation of the imprest \naccount. The SOE procedures are applicable to individual payments not exceeding $50,000. \nDisbursements as of 6 May 2008 amounted to $1.767 million representing 19.62% of the loan \namount including capitalized financing charges of $0.232 million. The loan imprest account \nturnover ratio is 1.87. The equivalent current net value of the loan, which is denominated in \nSDR, has appreciated from $8,000,000.00 when the loan was negotiated in October 2003 to \n$9,002,422.87 as of 6 May 2008. \n \n6.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n22.  The  PMU  is  responsible  for  preparing  quarterly  project  progress  reports  on  project \nimplementation, and for maintaining separate accounts and records of expenditures for the \nProject. Externally-audited project accounts and financial statements are submitted to ADB on \nan annual basis. ADB has been provided with the quarterly progress reports on a timely basis. \nSubmission of the fiscal year (FY) 2006 audited project accounts to ADB was delayed by 6 \nmonths; however, the FY2007 audited project accounts were submitted to ADB prior to the due \ndate. The submission of audited financial statements for SWA has been erratic with delays of up \nto 14 months.9 More recently, the timeliness of submissions has improved and the FY2007 \naudited financial statements were submitted 4 days after the due date (31 March 2008). \n \n7.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n23.  A project performance management system, including baseline data, was established to \nfacilitate reporting, monitoring, and evaluation of key performance indicators. The indicators \ncomprise  service  levels,  treated  wastewater  quality,  and  other  measures  of  operating \nperformance; percentage of wastewater collected and treated; user satisfaction with the urban \nenvironment; and relevant health, environmental and economic data to monitor project impacts.  \n                                                 \n8  The PIA consultants\u2019 inputs included design and supervision of civil works components, training of SWA and MWTI \npersonnel in the design and implementation of drainage and wastewater systems, financial analysis of SWA\u2019s \nwastewater operations including preparation of a review of the wastewater tariffs and design, and implementation \nof community awareness and education programs. \n9  The FY2005 audited financial statements were submitted 14.1 months late. ", "  7\n8.  Project Review \n24.  Project review missions are fielded at 6-month intervals. The Inception Mission was \nfielded from 10 to 18 October 2004 and the Midterm Review Mission from 25 March to 4 April \n2008. \n \nF.  Related Technical Assistance \n25.  A technical assistance (TA) grant for the Institutional Strengthening for Drainage and \nWastewater  Management  was  approved  together  with  the  original  loan.10 The  Treasury \nDepartment is the Executing Agency for the TA; PUMA is the Implementing Agency. The TA \nprovided 11 person-months of international and 13 person-months of national consultant inputs \nto provide institutional strengthening of PUMA, SWA, and MWTI in drainage and wastewater \nmanagement. Specific components of the TA included preparation of drainage and wastewater \nmaster plans, capacity building in drainage and wastewater planning, review and amendment of \nthe national standards for on-site sewage treatment, drafting of sewerage regulations, and \ndevelopment of a geographic information system for urban planning purposes. The TA was \ncompleted in January 2008 and closed in May 2008. The TA objectives and planned outputs \nwere fully achieved. Total disbursements for the TA amounted to $393,151 or 98.3% of the TA \ngrant of $400,000. \n \nIV.  THE PROPOSED SUPPLEMENTARY FINANCING \nA.  The Cost Overrun \n26.  The estimated cost to implement the Project has risen significantly as a consequence of \nthe project implementation delay. The implementation schedule envisaged at appraisal may \nhave  contributed  to  an  initial  underestimation  of  costs.  Investment  costs,  excluding  costs \nassociated with the sludge treatment facility, flow gauging, and flood modeling,11 are estimated \nat $17.81 million, as compared to $10.00 million at appraisal. The impact of delays on project \ncosts can be attributed to (i) weakening of the US dollar against the currencies of bidders for \nmajor contracts and weakening of the US dollar against the euro where some equipment is \nsourced,12 (ii) wage increases, and (iii) substantial increases in price of materials and fuel \ncosts.13 The impact of these factors on project costs are reinforced by increased prices due to a \nbooming construction market in Australia and New Zealand.14 \n \n27.  An analysis was undertaken to determine the impacts of a weaker US dollar, wage \nincreases, and rising material prices on bid prices for the contracts that have already been bid.15 \nThe cumulative value of the contracts already awarded is $13.7 million compared with the \nappraisal cost estimate of $6.0 million for the same contracts. The depreciation of the US dollar \nagainst the currencies of the bidders accounted for $0.98 million of the cost overrun, wage \nincreases accounted for $0.71 million, and material cost increases accounted for $1.14 million. \nOther  factors  that  contributed  $3.98  million  to  the  cost  overrun  are  booming  construction \n                                                 \n10 ADB. 2003. Technical Assistance to the Independent State of Samoa for Institutional Strengthening for Drainage \nand Wastewater Management. Manila (TA 4229-SAM, for $400,000). \n11  Financed by the European Union. \n12  The US dollar weakened by more than 20% against the Australian dollar and the New Zealand dollar, and by 15% \nagainst the Samoan tala between September 2003 (time of appraisal) and August 2007 (when major bids were \nsubmitted). The US dollar depreciated by about 17% against the euro during the same time period. \n13  Material and consumable price increases include oil by 110%, steel by 109%, and plastic pipes by 45%. \n14  This particularly impacts the cost of expert personnel from Australia and New Zealand. \n15  The contracts that have already been bid represent 74% of the revised cost estimate. \n ", "8     \nmarkets in Australia and New Zealand, underestimation of sewer system construction costs \nduring project appraisal, and the need to extend the PMU and PIA consultancy contracts due to \nthe delayed implementation. Details of the cost overrun analysis are in Appendix 3. \n \n28.  With major contracts awarded, the risk of further cost overruns is small. Cost estimates \nfor the other components have taken into account current construction market conditions. With \nadvance procurement action to support timely implementation of the remaining components, \nprices are expected to remain at estimated costs.  \n \nB.  Impact on the Project \n29.  With estimated cost overruns, the approved financing for the Project is insufficient to \ncover the costs to achieve the objectives and outputs. A reduction in the project scope is not \npossible as the wastewater components (the sewerage system and the O&M program for \nindividual systems) are essential to achieve improved public health and environmental impacts, \nand the sewerage system components (the sewer network and the WWTP) are interdependent \nand cannot function independently. The estimated cost overrun for implementation of the project \ncomponents (as defined under the original Project), with the exception of the EU-financed \ncomponents, amounts to $7.81 million. The EU grants have reduced the estimated cost overrun \nby approximately $2.1 million, from $9.91 million to $7.81 million. \n \n30.  Despite significant cost overruns, the project components remain economically viable. \nThe Project is key in improving public health and the environment in Apia, and will help reduce \neconomic costs resulting from flooding. The contribution from tourism-related activities to gross \ndomestic  product  has  increased  from  41%  in  2003  to  over  48%  in  2006.  The  continued \ndevelopment of the tourism sector is highly dependent on sustainable resource management \nand a clean environment. The Project will indirectly contribute to sustained economic growth by \nimproving the environment for expansion of the tourism industry. \n \nC.  Lessons \n31.  Implementation  Delays.  A  number  of  lessons  are  evident  from  ADB  support  for \ninfrastructure development projects in Samoa. Cost overruns have historically been related to \ndelays in implementation. Deferred loan effectiveness, and technical and procurement aspects \nhave been the major contributing factors to delays in project implementation. The risk of delays \nin project implementation and associated cost overruns for projects needs to be identified during \nproject preparation. The preparation of bid documents during project preparation will reduce the \nrisk of project implementation delays.  \n \n32.  Cost Estimates. Samoa is reliant on international markets, particularly for civil works \ncontracts in New Zealand and Australia, and the preparation of accurate cost estimates is \ndifficult as external factors, which are difficult to gauge, often directly impact on costs in Samoa. \nPhysical contingencies must be sufficient to allow for technical uncertainties, and the selection \nof procurement methods must consider the capacity of implementing agencies to manage and \ncoordinate contracts, and their ability to attract sufficient qualified bidders.  \n \nD.  Rationale \n33.  The original project rationale remains valid; effective drainage and wastewater systems \nin  Apia  are  urgently  required.  Due  to  climate  change,  Samoa  is  experiencing  increased \nexposure to natural disasters. With increased economic activity and population growth in Apia, ", "  9\nthe economic, health, and environmental impacts are more severe than in 2003 when the \nProject was approved. Apia experienced two additional severe flooding events in 2006 and \n2008. While Samoa has experienced stable economic growth, the impact of the 2006 flood was \nsevere and contributed to a sharp reduction in economic growth.16 The importance of mitigation, \nprevention, and climate change adaptation has become more critical and more recognized since \nthe Project was first approved in 2003. The Project forms part of the Government\u2019s identified \nmitigation measures to improve readiness for natural disasters.  \n \n34.  The Project supports ADB\u2019s water policy17 by (i) improving and expanding the delivery of \nwastewater  services;  and  (ii)  increasing  wastewater  service  efficiencies  and  sustainability \nthrough the introduction of sewerage tariffs and environmental charges, and increased public \nawareness. \n \n35.  The Project is eligible for supplementary financing under ADB\u2019s policy criteria as: \n(i)  the  Project  is  specifically  identified  as  a  high-priority  activity  under  the \nGovernment\u2019s draft Strategy for the Development of Samoa 2008\u20132010, \n(ii)  supplementary financing will help achieve the project objectives and benefits, \n(iii)  supplementary financing was not previously provided, and \n(iv)  the amount of supplementary financing will not exceed the original financing \napproved by ADB. \n \nE.  Special Features \n36.  Revolving Fund. A septic tank maintenance and replacement program (the revolving \nfund) will be established under the Project. The program, to be provided by SWA, will improve \nApia\u2019s environment and public health through more effective management of sewage generated \nin areas not served by the central business area wastewater management system. The program \nwill  provide  regular  pump-outs  of  septic  tanks,  initially  on  a  2-year  cycle,  and  replace \napproximately 400 septic tanks per year so that 8,000 premises18 in greater Apia receive new \nseptic tanks over a 20-year period. The program will be financed under the revolving fund, with \nthe initial capital injection of $900,000 financed by the supplementary financing. The initial \ncapital injection will finance a consultancy to design and implement the septic tank maintenance \nand replacement program, and the replacement of 500 septic tanks. SWA will outsource the \nprogram\u2019s operation and management activities. The relatively small size of the program will \nenable  national  consultants  and  contractors  to  participate  and  avoid  the  need  to  develop \ncomplex outsourcing agreements. The scale and operating cost will be assessed under the \nconsultancy to design and implement during program implementation. \n \n37.  SWA will collect user charges (environmental charge) for full recovery of the investment \ncosts and O&M costs of the septic tank maintenance and replacement program, and debt \nservice,  as  well  as  a  rate  of  return  to  be  agreed  upon  between  MOF  and  SWA.  The \nenvironmental charges and user tariffs for the forthcoming fiscal year will be reviewed annually \nfor Cabinet consideration for the duration of the Project with the first review becoming effective \non 1 July 2009. As a condition for effectiveness for supplementary financing, the Cabinet will \npass a resolution approving a cost recovery mechanism (the \u201cCost Recovery Mechanism\u201d) \nproviding until the Closing Date for the full cost recovery of: (i) the investment costs and the \noperations and maintenance costs associated with the septic tank subcomponent through an \n                                                 \n16  Gross domestic product growth decreased from 5.1% in 2005 to 2.6% in 2006. \n17  ADB. 2003.

Community Awareness Program. A comprehensive community awareness program \nwas developed and is being implemented with the direct involvement of the community. The \nprogram assesses the education and information needs of the community and identifies the \nspecial needs of low-income and vulnerable households. The program is delivering targeted \ninformation about the Project and its impacts, specifically the rights and obligations of the \nGovernment,  households,  organizations,  and  communities;  and  general  information  about \nrelated environmental and health issues. The community awareness program will inform the \ncommunity of costs associated with delivery of the sanitation services and the need for user \ncharges. \n \n39.  Aid Coordination. ADB and the EU are collaborating to improve water supply and \nwastewater  services  in  Samoa.  The  EU  is  supporting  SWA  with  investments  to  enhance \nefficiency and quality of water supply and sanitation services in rural areas through a water \nsector  support  program  project.  As  part  of  its  engagement,  the  EU  is  supporting  the \nGovernment with a water tariff review in consultation with ADB. The EU has assisted the \nGovernment in addressing the Project\u2019s cost overrun by providing grants for the construction of \na wastewater sludge treatment facility at Tafaigata, near Apia, and undertaking topographical \nand  cadastral  surveys  to  establish  correct  levels  in  the  floodplain  and  low-lying  area  and \nhydraulic modeling of flood flows. \n \nF.  Asian Development Fund IX Grant Component \n40.  Samoa\u2019s overall public sector debt position has been improving since the early 1990s \nfrom over 100% of gross domestic product to about 43% in 2003. The debt to gross domestic \nproduct ratio improved to about 38% in late 2006. While Samoa has experienced an average \nannual growth rate of about 3.6% since 2003, economic growth remains highly vulnerable to \nclimatic and global price shocks. This is evidenced by the economic downturn in 2006 as a \nresult of floods and by the key underlying factors for the cost increases of the Project. The \nproposed grant of $2.22 million will ease the macroeconomic impact of the supplementary \nfinancing requirements for the Project.  \n \nG.  Revised Cost Estimates \n41.  The  revised  total  investment  cost  for  implementation  of  the  project  components  as \ndefined under the original Project, with the exception of components financed by the EU, is \nestimated at $17.81 million equivalent, including taxes and duties of $2.17 million. Financing \ncharges during implementation are estimated at $0.57 million. The revised cost estimates are \nsummarized in Table 3 and detailed in Appendix 4. \n ", " 11\nH.  Financing Plan \n42.  The Government has requested a supplementary loan of SDR 1.71 million and a grant of \n$2.22 million, both from the Asian Development Fund, to help finance the cost overrun of the \nProject. The supplementary loan will have a 32-year term, including a grace period of 8 years, \nand interest rate of 1.0% during the grace period, and 1.5% thereafter, and such other terms \nand conditions set forth in the Financing Agreement and the amended Project Agreement. \n \n43.  The  loan  and  grant  will  be  provided  to  the  Independent  State  of  Samoa.  The \nGovernment will relend a portion of the loan and grant to SWA. The relending will have a 30-\nyear term, including a grace period of 5 years, and an interest rate of 5% per annum and such \nother terms and conditions set forth in the amended Subsidiary Financing Agreement between \nthe Government and SWA.19 The Government will assume the foreign exchange risk arising \nfrom the loan. \n \nTable 3: Revised Cost Estimates \n($ million) \n \nItem     Amounts \n       \nA.

Remedial Steps \n46.  Bid  documents  have  been  prepared  for  all  civil  works  components  proposed  for \nsupplementary financing. Approval of retroactive financing will facilitate timely implementation of \nthe Project by allowing contract awards prior to approval of the supplementary financing. To \nensure that project implementation capacity remains within the implementing agencies, the \nPMU consultants will be retained until project completion. The scope of the PIA consultants will \nbe varied to enable full-time construction, supervision, and contract administration. \n \nJ.  Implementation Arrangements \n47.  The  existing  implementation  arrangements  for  the  Project  in  terms  of  (i)  project \nmanagement; (ii) accounting, auditing, and reporting; and (iii) project performance monitoring \nand evaluation are considered adequate and will remain unchanged. Project review missions \nwill continue to be undertaken on a 6-monthly basis. MOF will provide ADB with a project \ncompletion report within 3 months of physical completion of the Project. \n \n1.  Implementation Period \n48.  The closing date for the loan will be extended from 30 June 2009 to 31 December 2010. \nThe revised implementation schedule is in Appendix 5. \n \n2.  Procurement \n49.  The equipment, material, and works financed by the proceeds of the ADB loan and grant \nwill be procured in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from \ntime to time). The relevant sections of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) \nare included in all contracts. Requirements of environmental monitoring and management plans \nare reflected in all civil works bid and contract documents. The updated procurement plan and \ncontract packages are detailed in Appendix 6. \n \n3.  Consulting Services \n50.  The PMU consultants were recruited in November 2004, their contract expired on 30 \nJune 2008. The PIA consultants were recruited in May 2006 and their contract expires on 31 \nDecember 2008. The PMU and the PIA consultants have performed well and their services are \nneeded for the duration of project implementation. The PMU and the PIA consultants will be \nrecruited using single source selection. Consultants required for the septic tank maintenance ", " 13\nand  replacement  program  will  be  recruited  using  quality-  and  cost-based  selection.  All \nconsultants will be recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. \n \n4.  Anticorruption Policy \n51.  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  was  explained  to  and  discussed  with  the  Government. \nConsistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability, and transparency, ADB \nreserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, \ncollusive,  or  coercive  practices  relating  to  the  Project.  To  support  these  efforts,  relevant \nprovisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended from time to time) are included in \nthe financing agreement and the bidding documents for the Project. In particular, all contracts \nfinanced by ADB in connection with the Project will include provisions specifying the right of \nADB  to  audit  and  examine  the  records  and  accounts  of  the  Executing  Agency  and  all \ncontractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service providers as they relate to the Project. \n5.  Advance Procurement Action and Retroactive Financing \n52.  To facilitate timely project implementation, ADB approved advance procurement action \nand  retroactive  financing  for  procurement  of  goods,  equipment  and  services,  consulting \nservices, and civil works contracts. Advance procurement action and retroactive financing will \nalso apply to the WWTP, which is being procured in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement \nGuidelines.  Up  to  20%  of  loan  and  grant  proceeds  are  eligible  for  retroactive  financing. \nRetroactive financing is applicable to eligible expenditures, which must be incurred before loan \neffectiveness, but generally not earlier than 12 months before signing of the financing and \nproject  agreements.  The  Government  and  SWA  were  advised  that  approval  of  advance \nprocurement action and retroactive financing does not commit ADB to financing the Project. \n \n6.  Disbursement Arrangements \n53.  The proceeds of the supplementary loan and grant will be disbursed in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook. To facilitate cash flow during project implementation, \nMOF will open separate imprest accounts for (a) the supplementary loan and (b) the grant \nimmediately after effectiveness. The imprest accounts will be exclusively used to finance the \nADB  share  of  eligible  expenditures  applicable  to  the  supplementary  financing.  The  initial \nadvance to be deposited to the imprest accounts will not exceed either 6 months of estimated \nexpenditures to be financed from the imprest accounts or 10% of the loan or grant amount, \nwhichever  is  lower.  The  direct  payment  procedure  will  apply  for  contracts  awarded  under \ninternational competitive bidding. If the Government initially funds eligible expenditures from its \nown resources, the reimbursement procedures will be used. To expedite funds flow and simplify \ndocumentation process, the SOE procedure will be used to liquidate and replenish the imprest \naccount and reimburse eligible expenditures not exceeding $100,000 per individual payment. \n \n7.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n54.  The PMU will maintain separate records and accounts for project components financed \nthrough  the  approved  loan  and  supplementary  financing.  Separate  audits  of  the  project \naccounts and financial statements for components financed under (i) the approved loan, and (ii) \nthe supplementary financing will be done annually by independent auditors acceptable to ADB. \nMOF will provide ADB with copies of the audited project accounts and financial statements for \nboth the approved loan and supplementary financing no later than 9 months after the end of the \nfiscal year to which they relate. The audit reports will include a separate opinion on the use of \n ", "14    \nthe imprest accounts and SOE procedures. MOF will provide ADB with quarterly progress \nreports on project implementation. Within 3 months of physical completion of the Project, MOF \nwill provide ADB with a project completion report. The PMU will compile progress reports. \n \nV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \nA.  Benefits \n55.  The economic analyses were reappraised for the drainage and floodway component and \nsewerage system. In the absence of investments in the drainage component, the status quo is \nassumed to continue. Benefits were evaluated in terms of economic cost savings associated \nwith damage to structures, infrastructure, and goods in central Apia that would continue to be \nincurred  as  a  result  of  flooding.20 Health  benefits  and  potential  benefits  associated  with \nincreased standards of living and commercial activities resulting from a cleaner environment \nwere not quantified for the purposes of the economic analyses. While the health benefits\u2014\nincluding  reduced  incidence  of  typhoid,  infant  diarrhea,  dengue,  and  leptospirosis\u2014and \nenvironmental benefits are large and identified as key impacts of the drainage and floodway \ncomponent, they are difficult to quantify and evaluate in terms of economic costs. \n \n56.  The benefits for the centralized sewerage system were evaluated in terms of economic \ncost savings as compared to the alternative investment scenario. The sewerage system will \nserve about 150 commercial and government premises in the central business district in Apia. \nThe  alternative  to  the  sewerage  system  is  to  continue  to  serve  these  costumers  with  a \ndecentralized system of individual septic tanks for small consumers and small package plants \nfor larger consumers. The septic tanks and small package plants are assumed to be operated \nand maintained to meet the same environmental and health standards as under the project \ninvestment scenario. \n  \n57.  The  economic  analyses  were  conducted  for  a  period  of  30  years,  including  an \ninvestment  period  of  5  years.  Taxes  and  duties  were  excluded  from  all  costs.  Economic \ninvestment  costs  include  the  original  cost  estimates  and  estimated  cost  overruns  of  \nST2.39 million ($0.96 million) for the drainage and floodway component, and ST11.10 million \n($4.44 million) for the sewerage system. The economic analyses yield economic internal rates \nof return of 13.2% for the drainage component and 16.5% for the wastewater component. The \nrates of return remain robust with respect to changes in key assumptions and risks. Risk of \nfurther delays and cost increases is negligible as implementation is advanced. Sustainability \nthroughout the life of the Project is ensured through the funding mechanism for O&M of the \nwastewater component. Details of the economic analysis are in Appendix 7. \n \nB.  Financial Aspects \n58.  An  assessment  of  cost-recovery  and  user  charges  was  undertaken  to  ensure \nsustainability for the sewerage system, and the septic tank maintenance and replacement \nprogram. SWA will conduct reviews of cost recovery and submit user charges to Cabinet on an \nannual basis.  \n \n                                                 \n20  Average annual flood damage was estimated based on data on damage costs from the 2001 and 2006 floods. For \nsevere flood events (1:20 flooding events), the analysis conservatively assumes that only 50% of damage costs \ncan be attributed to lack of drainage.   ", " 15\n59.  Sewerage  System.  Cost  recovery  from  beneficiaries  will  be  achieved  through  the \napplication of a wastewater tariff for those connected to the sewerage system. The tariff will be \nset on the basis of metered water consumption and applied by SWA as a separate line item on \ncustomers\u2019 water bills. At a minimum, the sewerage tariff will be set sufficient to cover the costs \nof O&M and management. Any gap between actual tariffs and those required to achieve full cost \nrecovery will be funded by the Government as a community service obligation.21 Details of \nanalysis of cost-recovery mechanisms and user charges are in Appendix 8. \n \n60.  Septic Tank Maintenance and Replacement Program. The program includes initial \ncapital to finance 500 tanks immediately and, as part of a revolving fund, it will finance the \nreplacement of approximately 400 septic tanks per year so that the 8,000 premises in greater \nApia receive new septic tanks over 20 years. Beyond the initial capital injection from the Project, \nthe program will be funded by an environmental charge to be levied on all 8,000 premises \nreceiving services under the program. The environmental charge will be set on the basis of \nmetered water consumption or alternatively as a fixed amount. This fee will be included on the \nSWA  water  bill  as  a  separate  line  item.  At  a  minimum,  the  environmental  charge  will  be \nsufficient to cover the costs of O&M and management of the program. The Government will \ncover all costs for annual capital expenditures for septic tank replacement that are not covered \nby the environmental charge. Charges were estimated under two alternative cost-recovery \nobjectives:  (i)  coverage  of  O&M  and  management  costs;  and,  (ii)  coverage  of  O&M  and \nmanagement costs, as well as annual capital expenditure requirements. \n \nC.  Social and Resettlement Impacts \n61.  A social analysis undertaken during project preparation22 concluded that some of the \npoorest households in Apia are located in low-lying areas identified in the project design for \nsanitation facility rehabilitation. They will benefit from improved living conditions and reduced \nhealth risks. Short land acquisition and resettlement plans were prepared and updated during \nthe Project\u2019s detailed design phase. The project land acquisition activities are complete and no \nfurther land acquisition requirement is anticipated. Interventions to address ADB\u2019s Policy on \nIndigenous  Peoples  (1998)  are  not  required  as  the  indigenous  population  makes  up  the \nmainstream society within Samoa; no social or cultural identities are \"distinct from that of the \ndominant or mainstream society.\" The updated summary poverty reduction and social strategy \nis in Appendix 9. \n \nD.  Environmental Impacts \n62.  An initial environmental examination for the Project was completed and confirms the \nclassification as category B. The Project\u2019s overall environmental effects are positive. The Project \nwill (i) improve surface and groundwater quality, including marine waters, by reducing untreated \nand  partially  treated  sewage  discharges  to  the  environment;  (ii)  improve  public  health  by \nreducing sewage and decreasing flooding; and (iii) reduce solid waste to urban streams and \nmarine waters by improving drainage system management. Effluent from the WWTP will be \ndischarged into the earth via infiltration trenches to avoid direct discharge of WWTP effluent to \nmangroves adjacent to the WWTP site. Stringent discharge criteria for the WWTP will ensure \nthat  effluent  has  negligible  impact  on  the  mangroves  and  Vaiusu  Bay.  An  environmental \nassessment for the overall Project was prepared and approved by PUMA, and is updated \n                                                 \n21  Community service obligations are Government-mandated services provided by public utilities to achieve broader \neconomic, environmental, and social objectives. \n22  ADB. 2002. Technical Assistance to the Independent State of Samoa for the Implementation of the Planning and \nUrban Management Strategy. Manila (TA 3860-SAM). \n ", "16    \nperiodically to reflect refinements of component designs and environmental monitoring and \nmanagement plans (EMPs). Civil works for the Project have only recently commenced and the \neffectiveness of the Project\u2019s EMPs cannot yet be assessed. However, adjustments to the \nEMPs will not likely be required. \n \nE.  Risks and Assumptions \n63.  Commitment to Sustainable Urban Management. The Government demonstrates its \ncommitment to the Project and overall urban management through the establishment of PUMA, \npromulgation of the Planning and Urban Management Bill, and efforts to develop this Project. \nBusiness community support and participation have been fostered through ongoing dialogue \nwith  the  business  community  during  project  development  and  implementation.  Community \nconsultations  are  undertaken  as  an  integral  part  of  project  implementation.  The  Project \nemphasizes  the  importance  of  building  community  and  other  stakeholder  awareness  as \ncommitment to the Project, as well as building SWA and government responsiveness to the \ncommunity\u2019s needs and views. To enhance effectiveness and sustainability of the capacity \ndevelopment  measures,  the  project  capacity  development  components  include  significant \ninteraction  with  the  Government  and  SWA  throughout  project  implementation.  The \nestablishment and funding of a twinning arrangement for SWA with a well-established utility will \npromote long-term capacity development. \n \n64.  Commitment and Availability of Financial Resources for O&M of the Drainage and \nWastewater Infrastructure. The Government and SWA have demonstrated their commitment \nto improve cost recovery through recent water tariff increases, enactment of the public bodies \nbill to promote sustainable commercial operations for public enterprises, and review of the \nProject\u2019s  cost-recovery  issues.  Cabinet  endorsement  of  cost-recovery  mechanisms  for  the \nsewerage system, and the septic tank maintenance and replacement program is a condition for \neffectiveness of supplementary financing. \n \n65.  Community Opposition to Land Acquisition for the Project. Land acquisition for the \nProject  is  now  complete,  and  additional  land  acquisition  is  not  anticipated.  Extensive \nconsultations with the community have been undertaken and will continue for the duration of the \nProject to keep the public informed of project activities and impacts. An updated land acquisition \nand resettlement plan was prepared and disclosed on ADB\u2019s website in May 2008.  \n \n66.  Issuance of Sewerage Regulations. Draft sewerage regulations were prepared under \nthe Institutional Strengthening for Drainage and Wastewater Management TA (footnote 10) \nfollowing consultations with key stakeholders including SWA, PUMA, and Office of the Attorney \nGeneral. The Cabinet is expected to endorse the sewerage regulations by 30 September 2008. \n \n67.  Further Project Delays and Cost Increases. Further delays and project cost increases \nare not expected as the majority of the works have been awarded. Bid documents for works yet \nto be bid have been completed. \n \nVI.  ASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \nA.  Specific Assurances \n68.  In  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n ", " 17\n(i)  Sewerage Tariffs and Environmental Charges.

The  Government  will  ensure  that  (a)  all  Project  facilities  are \ndesigned, constructed, operated, maintained and monitored in compliance with \nthe Government\u2019s applicable environmental laws and regulations, and ADB\u2019s \nEnvironment Policy (2002), it being agreed by the Government that, in case of \n ", "18    \nany discrepancy between the Government\u2019s laws and regulations, and ADB's \nEnvironment Policy, the ADB policy requirements will apply; and (b) the IEE is \nupdated and submitted to ADB for clearance, and corresponding approval from \nthe relevant Government authorities is obtained should there be changes in the \nProject design that would cause significant environmental impacts that are not \nincluded in the scope of the current IEE. \n(viii)  In accordance with the EMP, the Government, through the PMU, will ensure that \n(a)  contractors  engaged  under  the  works  contracts  comply  strictly  with  all \nenvironmental impact mitigation and monitoring requirements set out in the EMP \nand  the  contract  documents,  and  (b)  consultants  engaged  for  construction \nsupervision  (i)  closely  monitor  compliance  of  the  contractors  with  the \nenvironmental  impact  mitigation  and  monitoring  requirements  and  reporting \nrequirements, and (ii) provide the PMU with the necessary assistance to improve \nits oversight of components which will be carried out through EU Financing. \n(ix)  The Government, through the PMU, will ensure that the consultants, contractors \nand staff recruited for the EU-financed component coordinate closely with those \nrecruited under this Financing Agreement. \n(x)  Gender  and  Employment.  The  Government  will  take  all  reasonable  and \nnecessary  steps  to  encourage  women  living  in  Apia  to  participate  in  the \nimplementation  of  the  Project,  including  but  not  limited  to,  advertising  job \nopportunities in women community centers, making public radio announcements \ninforming  women  where  to  apply  for  a  job  and  publishing  newspaper \nadvertisements stressing that women are encouraged to apply. The Government \nwill ensure that the PMU, as well as contractors and consultants employed for \nthe  Project  do  not  discriminate  against  female  applicants  and  will  expressly \nencourage them to employ women for both skilled and unskilled labor needs. In \nany instance where compensation for land acquired for the Project is paid, the \nGovernment will ensure that such compensation is paid into a bank account \nopened and kept in the joint name of the husband and wife, where relevant. \n(xi)  Governance. The PMU will ensure that Project staff (including the PMU staff, \ncontractors and consultants) are fully knowledgeable of and comply with the \nGovernment\u2019s and ADB\u2019s procedures, including, but not limited to, procedures for \n(i) implementation, (ii) procurement, (iii) use of consultants, (iv) disbursement, (v) \nreporting, (vi) monitoring, and (vii) prevention of fraud and corruption. \n(xii)  Anti-Corruption.  The  Government  and  SWA  will  comply  with  ADB\u2019s \nAnticorruption  Policy  (1998).  The  Government  and  SWA  agree  that  ADB \nreserves the right: (a) to investigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged \ncorrupt, fraudulent, collusive or coercive practices relating to the Project; and (b) \nto  cooperate  fully  with  any  such  investigation  and  extend  all  necessary \nassistance, including providing access to all relevant information and records, for \nthe satisfactory completion of any such investigation. SWA will also: (a) conduct \nperiodic inspections on the contractors\u2019 activities relating to fund withdrawals and \nsettlements; and (b) ensure that all contracts financed by ADB in connection with \nthe Project include provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and examine \nthe records and accounts of all contractors, suppliers, consultants and other \nservice providers of the Project. \n(xiii)  Physical  Component  Maintenance  Policy.  Within  six  months  prior  to  the \nProject completion date, the Government and SWA, through the PMU, will have ", " 19\nconfirmed maintenance plans for the physical components constructed under the \nProject, including budget and implementation arrangements, and submit them to \nADB for review and concurrence. \n(xiv)  EU  Financing.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  the  Project  Safeguard \nDocuments are applied to the entire Project, including the EU-financed portions \nof the Project. The Government will further ensure that all EU representatives, \nagents, staff, consultants and contractors are aware and familiar with the Project \nSafeguard Documents. The Government will keep ADB informed on a quarterly \nbasis on the progress in implementing the Project Safeguard Documents of the \nProject, including with respect to components carried out through EU Financing. \n(xv)  SWA Management. The Government will ensure that a dedicated division with \nadequate  staffing  remains  in  place  within  SWA  to  carry  out  wastewater \nmanagement and sanitation services throughout Project implementation. \n(xvi)  Twinning  Arrangement.

Economic Rationale \n1.  Samoa is a small and highly import-dependent country that relies largely on official \ntransfers and remittances for foreign currency revenues. The country is vulnerable to climate \nchange and natural disasters. Despite these vulnerabilities, it has experienced stable economic \ngrowth over the last 5 years. Growth of real gross domestic product averaged 3.6% per annum, \nwell above the average growth rate of Pacific region economies. The annual long-term growth \nrate  is  expected  to  be  around  3.5%.  Economic  growth  is  mainly  driven  by  agriculture, \nconstruction, finance, and business services. The main growth center is Apia. Samoa is also \nbenefiting from an increase in tourism. Increasing economic activity and developing the private \nsector are key strategies to sustain economic growth and reduce poverty. The Government is \nalso placing increased emphasis on climate change adaptation to improve the protection of \ninfrastructure assets, and reduce the economic and social impacts of natural disasters. \n \n2.  The  Government\u2019s  Strategy  for  the  Development  of  Samoa  2008\u20132010  lays  the \nfoundation for sustainable and broad-based economic growth supported by continued reforms \nand private sector development to improve the quality of life for all people in Samoa. The \nprovision of sufficient basic infrastructure services and reduction of the country\u2019s vulnerability to \nexternal shocks are essential to achieve long-term sustainable economic growth.  \n \n3.  Urban Apia currently lacks an efficient drainage system. Severe floods were recorded in \n1939, 1975, 2001, 2003, and 2006. In addition, localized flooding occurs annually. The damage \nto  structures,  and  the  environmental  and  social  impacts  from  flooding  have  significantly \ndisrupted  economic  activity  and  impacted  standards  of  living.  The  vulnerability  to  natural \ndisasters is evidenced by the sharp reduction in economic growth from 5.1% in 2005 to 2.6% in \n2006, when a severe flood occurred. This situation is compounded by lack of an efficient and \ncentralized system for wastewater management. The Country Environmental Analysis: Samoa1 \nidentified  the  need  to  address  the  high  solid  waste  generation  and  inadequate  waste \nmanagement practices. The Sanitation and Drainage Project (the Project) was identified to \nimprove Apia\u2019s environment and public health to meet the objectives of the Government\u2019s water \nsector plan.2  \n \n4.  The Project has experienced significant cost overruns as a result of factors associated \nwith implementation delays. The economic analyses were reappraised for the drainage and \nfloodway, and wastewater components.  \n \nB.  Methodology \n5.  The economic analyses were conducted over 30 years, including the investment period. \nAll  economic  costs  exclude  taxes  and  duties  and  are  expressed  using  a  domestic  price \nnumeraire. A shadow exchange rate factor of 1.05 was calculated based on the value of imports \nand exports, and related taxes during 2005\u20132006. It is applied to all tradable goods. Foreign \nand domestic skilled labor is treated as tradable goods due to the ease and frequency with \nwhich Samoans obtain work in the international labor market. The estimated cost overrun for the \ndrainage  component  is  ST2.39  million  and  for  the  wastewater  component  ST11.10  million \n($4.44 million). Cost increases associated with consulting services of ST1.20 million ($0.48 \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2006. Country Environmental Analysis: Samoa.

", "    Appendix 7   37 \n \nmillion) are included in the economic investment costs. Physical contingencies are included in \nall cost estimates. \n \n1.  Drainage and Floodway Component  \n \n6.  The drainage and floodway component will mitigate flooding of the Gasegase River, \nAsaga Stream Bypass, and Fugalei Stream area to the southwest of the central business area \nin Apia; and provides data required for developing a broader drainage management plan to \nguide  future  improvements.  The  investment  will  rehabilitate  the  Fugalei  River,  Gasegase \nStream, and Asaga Stream bypass channels through the removal of debris and silt. Flow-\ngauging stations will be installed to monitor stream flow, and provide data for hydraulic modeling \nand further drainage design. The investment cost for this component is estimated at ST10.94 \nmillion ($4.38 million), or ST4.97 million ($3.58 million) at economic prices. Operation and \nmaintenance costs are assumed to be 2% of the total investment cost. \n \n7.  In the absence of investments in a drainage and floodway system, current conditions of \nflooding would continue. The benefits of the drainage system are evaluated in terms of avoided \neconomic costs associated with damage to structures, infrastructure, and goods in central Apia \nthat would continue to be incurred as a result of flooding. The avoided costs are derived from \ndata presented in two recent studies on the damage of flooding in Apia prepared by the South \nPacific Applied Geoscience Commission.  \n \n8.  The first study3 relied on insurance records and personal interviews with recent flood \nvictims to assess overall damage incurred by the April 2001 flood. About 1,300 buildings were \naffected, with total financial losses of ST11.1 million.4 The second study5 focused only on the \nLower Vaisigano catchment area of Apia, but provides more details on flood damage in that \nzone. The study utilizes the flood stage damage curve to estimate total direct damage costs to \nhousehold, commercial, health, and social establishments, as well as public infrastructure over \na broad range of possible flood events.6 \n \n9.  The calculation of benefits for the drainage component combines the damage data from \nthe  2001  study  with  damage  data  and  flood  stage  damage  curves  from  the  2008  study \nextrapolated to the project area.7 The damage costs (in financial terms) estimated for each flood \nevent (footnote 6) are shown in Figure A7. These costs are annualized based on probability of \nthe event occurring in a given year. Damage costs are based on annual costs of severe and \nserious flooding events. Damage associated with frequent minor flooding events (1:1 year or \nmore often) are excluded from the benefit calculation. The average annual damage costs are \nestimated  at  ST2.33  million  ($0.93  million).  The  average  annual  damage  avoided  by  the \ndrainage component is conservatively estimated by assuming that only half the damage costs \nassociated with the 1:20 year event and above would be mitigated. The full damage costs \nassociated with the 1:5 year and 1:2 year events are assumed to be fully mitigated by the \ninvestment. The total avoided damage cost is estimated at ST1.99 million ($0.76 million). The \n                                                 \n3  Yeo, Stephen. 2001. A Review of Flooding in Apia, Samoa.

The  health  and  other  benefits  associated  with  improved  standards  of  living  and \ncommercial activities resulting from a cleaner environment were not quantified for the economic \nanalysis. While the health benefits, including reduced incidences of typhoid, infant diarrhea, \ndengue, and leptospirosis; and environmental benefits are significant and identified as key \nimpacts of the drainage component, they are difficult to quantify and assign specifically to \nimproved drainage.     \n \n2.  Wastewater Management and Sanitation Component \n \n11.  The wastewater management and sanitation component will complement the drainage \ncomponent by providing (i) a centralized operating sewerage system servicing approximately \n150 commercial and government premises in the central business district in Apia, and (ii) a \ndecentralized septic tank maintenance and replacement program.  \n \n12.  Most septic tanks within the Apia area currently do not meet the construction standards \nrequired under the National Building Code and do not treat sewage adequately. Septage from \nthe majority of septic tanks discharge directly to water courses or to aquifers creating a public \nhealth hazard and causing environmental degradation. The discharge of septage to public \ndrains is a prohibited activity as noted under Section 3(d) of the Public Drains Regulations 2006 \nand contravenes Section 63(d) of the Planning and Urban Management Act 2003. The septic \ntank  maintenance  and  replacement  program  will  provide  services  to  premises  for  which \nconnection to the centralized sewerage system is not economically viable. The program will \ninitially service about 500 customers and be expanded over time through a revolving fund to \nservice approximately 8,000 customers.  \n \n13.  The economic analysis for the centralized sewerage system compares the with-project \ninvestment scenario to an alternative on-site individual investment scenario. Both scenarios are ", "    Appendix 7   39 \n \nassumed to provide similar environmental and health benefits.8 The investment costs of the \nwith-project scenario are estimated at ST31.19 million ($12.48 million) in financial terms and \nST25.45 million ($10.19 million) in economic terms. The total annual economic operation and \nmaintenance (O&M) costs are derived from the financial model for the wastewater treatment \nplant and the pressure sewer system, and include management costs (Appendix 8).  \n \n14.  The alternative to the sewerage system is assumed to be a continuation of on-site \ntreatment systems. The alternative assumes two types of individual systems depending on \nwater demand and associated volume of wastewater generated by three customer groups \ncategorized by size. Small-use customers, defined as those that could be served by a single \nseptic tank, would be serviced by a septic tank with an investment cost of ST12,500 and an \nannual  maintenance  cost  of  ST500.  These  septic  tanks  require  six  pump-outs  per  year.9 \nMedium-and large-use customers will require small package plants with an investment cost of \nST300,000 and annual O&M costs of ST34,000, inclusive of pump-outs. The investment costs \nand O&M costs are scaled for the estimated volume of wastewater (Table A7.1). \n \nTable A7.1: Estimated Costs and Capacity of Individual Sewerage Systems \n \nCapital Cost  Annual O&M \nVolume of Wastewater a     \n(ST\u2018000)  (ST\u2018000) \nCustomer \nTotal \nm3/User/day    Per m3/day b Total    Per m3/day b  Total \nm3/day \nLargec  90.6  634    31.2  19,777    2.45  1,553 \nMediumd  8.6  240    31.2  7,494    2.45  588 \nSmall e  1.3  125    9.6  1,200    1.53  192 \nTotal  7.6  1,000    28.5  28,471    2.33  2,333 \nm3 = cubic meter, O&M = operation and maintenance. \na Recorded total water demand scaled to wastewater treatment plant capacity of 1,000 m3 per day. \nb Cost per m3 daily wastewater volume. \nc Seven largest customers. \nd Require more than one septic tank except for the seven largest customers. \ne Require one septic tank. \nSources: Samoa Water Authority and Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nC.  Economic Results and Sensitivity Analysis \n15.  All costs and benefits are expressed in constant 2008 prices and are discounted by an \neconomic opportunity cost of capital of 12%. The economic analyses yield internal economic \nrates of returns of 13.2% for the drainage and floodway component (Table A7.2) and 16.5% for \nthe sewerage system (Table A7.3). The results are robust with respect to changes in key \nassumptions and risks, although the analysis shows that combined adverse events will cause \nthe internal economic rates of return to fall below the economic opportunity cost of capital \n(Tables  A7.4  and  A7.5).  Risk  of  further  delays  and  cost  increases  is  negligible  as \nimplementation is advanced.

User  charges  were  estimated  for  the  wastewater  management  and  sanitation \ncomponent,  including  (i)  the  sewerage  system,  and  (ii)  the  septic  tank  maintenance  and \nreplacement program. These estimates were prepared on the basis of agreements reached \nbetween the Government of Samoa, Samoa Water Authority (SWA), and Asian Development \nBank (ADB) to establish mechanisms to ensure appropriate cost recovery for these project \ncomponents. \n \n2.  Direct cost recovery from beneficiaries will be achieved through (i) the application of a \ntariff for those connected to the sewerage system, and (ii) an environmental charge for those \nserved by the septic tank maintenance and replacement program. SWA\u2019s responsibilities for \nmanaging the operations of both project components will include the billing and collection of the \nwastewater  tariff  and  environmental  charge.  To  ensure  that  these  charges  continue  to  be \nsufficient to achieve the agreed cost-recovery objectives, SWA will prepare annual reviews of \nthe charges and submit them for Cabinet consideration.  \n \nA.  Sewerage System  \n3.  The sewerage system will provide for the collection, treatment, and disposal of sewage \ngenerated in Apia\u2019s central business area, as well as several priority special needs areas, \nincluding the National Hospital, Malifa School, and Fugalei Market. The system will provide \naverage  treatment  capacity  of  1,000 cubic  meters  (m3)/day  and  serve  approximately  150 \nbusiness and government premises. \n \n4.  Cost Recovery. Direct cost recovery from beneficiaries will be achieved through the \napplication of a wastewater tariff for those connected to the sewerage system. The tariff will be \nset on the basis of metered water consumption and applied by SWA as a separate line item on \ncustomers\u2019 water bills. At a minimum, the wastewater tariff will be sufficient to cover the cost of \noperation  and  maintenance  (O&M),  and  management.  The  Government  will  fund  any  gap \nbetween actual tariffs and the amount required to achieve full cost recovery as a community \nservice obligation (CSO). CSOs are Government-mandated services provided by public utilities \nintended to achieve broader economic, environmental, and social objectives. Given these wider \nobjectives, the ability to fully recover costs from user charges is generally limited, at least over \nthe shorter term. In fiscal year (FY) 2007, SWA received just under ST3 million from the \nGovernment for CSOs relating to its existing water supply operations. \n \n5.  Key Assumptions. Financial projections were prepared for the sewerage system to \nestimate  tariff  and  CSO  funding  requirements.  The  key  assumptions  underlying  these \nprojections are as follows: \n \n(i)  Project life. The project component will commence operations in FY2010 with an \neconomic useful life of 30 years.  \n(ii)  Wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) O&M costs. These are estimated for \neach year over the project life by individual cost item: labor, electricity, chemicals, \nsludge transport and disposal, spare parts, and other maintenance. In FY2010, \nthe  cost  of  WWTP  O&M  is  estimated  at  ST930,000,  expressed  in  constant \nFY2008  prices.  Over  the  life  of  the  facility,  a  gradual  increase  in  costs  is \nprojected due to greater maintenance requirements. \n ", "44  Appendix 8 \n(iii)  Pressure sewer O&M costs. Estimated for each year by individual cost item: \nlabor,  electricity,  pump  maintenance,  and  sewer  maintenance.  The  cost  of \nelectricity required for the operation of the pumps will be borne directly by each \npremise served by the system. Therefore, this cost is excluded from SWA\u2019s \noperating costs for the purposes of tariff calculation. Total O&M costs borne by \nSWA in FY2010 are estimated at ST95,000 in constant prices. For the WWTP, \nmaintenance costs will gradually increase over the project life.  \n(iv)  Management  costs. Based on estimates presented in SWA\u2019s draft business \nplan for its Wastewater Management Division\u2014which will be responsible for both \nthe sewerage system, and septic tank maintenance and replacement program\u2014\njust over half the estimated total annual management cost, equivalent to about \nST160,000 in constant 2008 prices, is allocated to the wastewater system.  \n(v)  Capital  replacement  costs.  The  major  requirement  is  replacement  of  the \npressure sewer pumps, which have an estimated life of 20 years. Based on this, \nan annual provision is made equivalent to 5% of the total pump replacement cost. \n(vi)  Debt service. Debt service includes principal and interest, and is based on the \nterms of the subsidiary loan agreement between SWA and the Government. The \nterm of the loan is 32 years, including a 5-year grace period, and an interest rate \nof 5%. \n(vii)  Full cost recovery. Consistent with existing project legal agreements, full cost \nrecovery  is  defined  as  the  coverage  of  O&M  and  management  costs;  debt \nservice; and a rate of return agreed to between SWA and the Ministry of Finance. \nGiven that the rate of return has yet to be agreed, this is assumed to be a 3% \nannual return on revalued fixed assets.   \n(viii)  Wastewater tariff. The tariff requirements are estimated for each year over the \nuseful life of the project based on three alternative cost-recovery objectives:  \n(a) cover O&M and management expenses; (b) cover O&M and management \nexpenses plus debt service; and (c) achieve full cost recovery. The collection \nrate\u2014the  proportion  of  tariff  revenues  billed  that  SWA  actually  collects\u2014is \nassumed to be 90% initially with gradual improvement to 95% over the life of the \nProject. \n(ix)  CSO  funding.  The  Government  provides  the  difference  between  the  cost \nrecovery achieved by tariffs and that required for full cost recovery to SWA \nthrough CSO funding. \n(x)  Price basis. Costs and revenues are converted from constant to current prices \non the basis of the projected domestic inflation rate, which is 3.6% per year \nduring FY2008\u2013FY2011, and is assumed to then gradually decline to 3.2% by \nFY2015. \n \n6.  Wastewater  Tariffs  and  Government  Funding.

Based  on  the  required  tariffs,  total  monthly  wastewater  charges  for  a  range  of \ncommercial  premises  within  the  central  business  area  are  given  in  Table  A8.2.  With  the \nintroduction of a centralized sewerage system, existing on-site sanitation systems installed and \noperated by individual premises will no longer be required. Therefore, the net cost to consumers \nis  the cost  of  the  centralized sewerage  system  less  the  cost savings  associated  with  the \nelimination of these on-site systems.  \n \n8.  The total monthly charges are estimated on the basis of current water consumption, \nwhich is excessive due to low water tariffs. Water tariffs presently cover only about 40% of \nSWA\u2019s O&M expenses, and therefore need to be increased. With technical assistance from the \nEuropean Union, SWA is presently reviewing its water tariffs and will propose an increase to the \nGovernment in late 2008. The combination of higher water tariffs and the new wastewater tariff \nwill  result  in  much  more  efficient use  of  water.  Therefore,  with  less  water  consumed,  the \nfinancial impact of the wastewater charges will be reduced.    \n \nTable A8.2: Sewerage System \nEstimated Total Monthly Wastewater Charges in FY2010 \n(ST) \nBusiness 1  Business 2  Business 3  Business 4 \nDaily Water Consumed \n2 m3  8 m3  25 m3  225 m3 \n1.

Septic Tank Maintenance and Replacement Program \n9.  The septic tank maintenance and replacement program will improve Apia\u2019s environment \nand public health through the more effective management of sewage generated in areas not \nserved by the sewerage system. The program will provide for regular septic tank pump-outs on \na 2-year cycle, and maintenance and replacement on a 20-year cycle, servicing approximately \n8,000 premises in greater Apia. SWA will manage the program, but outsource its O&M to the \nprivate sector.   \n \n10.  The  septic  tank  maintenance  and  replacement  program  will  fund  the  immediate \nreplacement of up to 500 septic tanks servicing residential lots in Apia\u2019s low-lying areas. This \ninitial capital injection will provide the basis establishing a revolving fund for the septic tank \nreplacement  component  of  the  program.  The  revolving  fund  will  eventually  finance  the \ninstallation of new tanks in approximately 8,000 premises in greater Apia over 20 years.  \n \n11.  User Charges. Beyond the initial capital injection from the Project, the program will be \nfunded by an environmental charge, to be levied on all 8,000 premises receiving services under \nthe program. The environmental charge will be set on the basis of metered water consumption \nor alternatively as a fixed amount. This charge will be included on the SWA water bill as a \nseparate line item. \n \n12.  Cost Recovery. At a minimum, the environmental charge will be set to cover the costs \nof O&M and management of the program. If the charges are not adequate to also cover annual \ncapital expenditures for septic tank replacement, this cost will be funded by the Government. \nCharges are estimated under two alternative cost-recovery objectives: (i) coverage of O&M and \nmanagement costs; and (ii) coverage of O&M and management costs, as well as annual capital \nexpenditure requirements. \n \n13.  Key Assumptions. Environmental charges are estimated on the basis of the following \nkey assumptions: \n \n(i)  Program life. The program life is assumed to be 20 years. During this period, \nseptic tanks serving all 8,000 premises in the greater Apia area will be replaced \nunder the program. \n(ii)  Annual capital investments. Each year, 400 septic tanks will be replaced at a \nunit cost of ST2,500, expressed in constant 2008 prices. \n(iii)  O&M costs. Each septic tank is pumped out every 2 years at a cost of ST250 \nper pump-out. The annual cost of minor maintenance is ST50 per septic tank, \nexpressed on a constant price basis.   \n(iv)  Management  costs.  Annual  SWA  management  costs  are  estimated  at \nST150,000. The private sector contractors retained by SWA to implement the \nprogram will also incur estimated management of costs of ST400,000 per year. \n(v)  Environmental  charge. Charges are estimated as a fixed monthly fee. The \ncollection rate, the proportion of charges billed actually collected by SWA, is \nassumed to be 90%. \n(vi)  Price basis. Costs and revenues are converted from constant to current prices \non the basis of the projected domestic inflation rate. \n ", "    Appendix 8   47 \n \n14.  Environmental Charges and Government Funding. Estimated environmental charges \nare given in Table A8.3 for FY2010, the first full year of program operations, and for FY2015. \nExpressed in current prices, the environmental charge required to cover O&M and management \nis estimated at ST25 per premise in FY2010 and FY30 in FY2015. Since these charges do not \ncover  annual  capital  expenditures  requirements,  the  Government  would  need  to  fund  this \nrequirement, estimated to be ST1.1 million in FY2010 and FY1.3 million in FY2015.  \n \nTable A8.3: Septic Tank Maintenance and Replacement Program: Estimated \nEnvironmental Charges and Government Funding Requirements \n(current prices) \nFY2010  FY2015 \nCost Recovery Option  Charge  Government Charge  Government\n(ST/month) (ST \u2018000)  (ST/month)  (ST \u2018000) \n1.

Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \n \nThe Strategy for the Development of Samoa 2008\u20132010 (SDS) identifies the provisions of efficient and effective utility service \nand infrastructure as essential elements for economic growth, and specifically identifies the Project to help meet key \ndevelopment objectives. The strategy of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for Samoa, as articulated in the draft country \npartnership strategy (2008\u20132012), is aligned with the SDS 2008\u20132012 and supports the achievement of SDS goals through \ntwo pillars for intervention: (i) improved delivery of public services, including the removal of infrastructure constraints; and \n(ii) promotion of private sector development. Priority sectors identified in the country partnership strategy are (i) energy; \n(ii) water supply, sanitation, and waste management; and (iii) education. The priority themes are private sector development \nand sustainable economic growth. ADB assistance to the water sector in Samoa focuses on drainage and sanitation. \n \nSamoa\u2019s national vision is \u201censuring sustainable economic and social progress.\u201d Samoa has made significant progress \nover the past decade. Economic performance has achieved positive results, and social indicators have shown promising \nimprovements. Despite this, inequalities may be increasing for selected groups and significant challenges remain. Strategies \nto reduce hardship and increase opportunities cannot ignore the people\u2019s vital requirements for water, and the need for \nequitable and sustainable management of this critical resource in the interests of society as a whole. Access to public \nservices, quality of service delivery, and lack of income-generating opportunities have all been identified as major issues in \nrecent assessments of hardship and poverty in Samoa. The role of water is undeniable in reducing such constraints. \n \nSocial surveys and analysis undertaken during project preparation and implementation show that some of the poorest \nhouseholds in Apia are located in flood-prone and environmentally degraded low-lying areas. The Project includes elements \nthat specifically address flooding of the low-lying areas of Apia, and will contribute to improved environmental quality through \nimproved wastewater management and sanitation. The poor will benefit from improved living conditions and reduced health \nrisks. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                  Targeting Classification: General intervention \n1.    Key Issues  \n \nSome of the poorest households are located in marginal flood-prone and water-logged areas of Apia; their homes are \nfrequently subject to flooding causing damage to structures; loss of belongings; limited or loss of access to work places, \nservices, and facilities; and increased risk of waterborne disease. The poorest households cannot afford improved sanitation \nfacilities, resulting in increased health risks, environmental degradation, and loss of amenities. The Project directly benefits \nthe poorest households in Apia, particularly those living in low-lying areas by providing flood mitigation measures and \nimproved and well-maintained sanitation facilities (up to 500 households will be provided with septic tanks). The poor will also \nbenefit from environmental improvements resulting from improved wastewater management services. \n \n2.   Design Features  \n \nThe Project will directly benefit poverty reduction through the provision of some limited jobs for unskilled laborers during the \nconstruction phase and for ongoing drainage maintenance. Poverty reduction impacts can be expected from economic growth \nas a result of improvements to central business area infrastructure, private sector participation in the provision of utility \nfacilities, and improved marine environment for the fisheries industry. \n \nC.   Poverty Impact Analysis for Policy-Based Lending \n \nNot applicable \n \n \n ", "    Appendix 9   49 \n \nII.  SOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.  Findings of Social Analysis  \n \nPoverty data and information through a community consultation process contributed to the project design. Poverty analysis \nwas considered in relation to the cost-recovery and user-pay features of the wastewater and sanitation infrastructure \ncomponents. \n \nThe proportion of the poor in the service area population cannot be quantified meaningfully as Samoa has no official poverty \nline. Some of the poorest households in Apia are in the low-lying area identified in the project design for sanitation facility \nrehabilitation. Many Apia residents are urban migrants who live outside the traditional village structure and are exposed to \ngreater social and economic risks because they have no or limited access to traditional social protection mechanisms. These \npoor households will benefit from improved living conditions and reduction in health risks. The greater Apia area is likely to \ninclude some poor households that will share the same benefits, but with greater marginal utility. Urban poor relying on local \nfishing for consumption and income will benefit from the improved marine environment. Cleaner marine water will benefit \nthose using it for recreation. \n \nBecause this is an environmental project, the living conditions for all in the service area of the Project will improve. These \nbenefits will also accrue to the poor. Improved environmental quality will promote sustainable urban development, for \nexample, through tourism. The improvement in water quality will contribute to the steady development of a water-based \ntourism industry that depends directly on good water quality. \n \nB.  Consultation and Participation \n \nConsultation  with  key  stakeholders  was  undertaken  during  project  preparation  and  has  continued  throughout  the \nimplementation of the project through public meetings, workshops, and media campaigns. \n \n2. What level of consultation and participation (C&P) is envisaged during the project implementation and monitoring?  \n  Information sharing          Consultation         Collaborative decision making       Empowerment \n \n3. Was a C&P plan prepared?   Yes      No  \n \nThe Project includes a community education and public awareness program being implemented by the project implementation \nconsults. The program commenced in January 2008 and will continue for the duration of the Project. Key features include \n(i)  regular press releases including publication of monthly project feature articles, media interviews, and radio \ntalk shows; \n(ii)  the \u201cfriendly neighborhood\u201d campaign involving discussions and dissemination of project information to \nhouseholds within the project area; \n(iii)  community-wide distribution of a project information pamphlet in the Samoan language; and \n(iv)  radio and TV advertisement. \n \nActivities to date include \n(i)  development and dissemination of project information pamphlets in the Samoan language; the pamphlets \nwere distributed in the \u201cfriendly neighborhood\u201d\u2014door-to-door information campaign; \n(ii)  publication of feature articles on the Project in the national newspapers; \n(iii)  production of a sanitation and drainage brochure to be distributed to the public; \n(iv)  meetings with various stakeholders who could possibly contribute and assist with the awareness activities \nof the Project; \n(v)  development of the \u201ccommunity fact file\u201d (a quarter-page advertisement) published in local newspapers \nonce a week informing the general public and residents of the project sites of project issues and progress \nbefore, during, and after construction; and \n(vi)  monitoring of information released to the community through the media and other sources. \n \n ", "50  Appendix 9 \n \nC.
