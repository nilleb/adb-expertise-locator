It is ranked \nfirst in the world for vulnerability to earthquakes.5 The Spitak earthquake in 1988, measuring 6.9 \non  the  Richter  scale,  killed  25,000  people,  including  6,000  school  children,  and  left  517,000 \npeople homeless. More than 40% of the country\u2019s manufacturing capacity was destroyed. The \nestimated  direct  economic  loss  from  the  Spitak  earthquake  was  $15  billion\u2013$20  billion.  Since \nthe Spitak earthquake, the country has experienced five earthquakes registering 4.5\u20137.0 on the \nRichter scale.6 \n \n4. \nits  emergency \nmanagement  system,  including  creating  the  Ministry  of  Emergency  Situations  and  National \nSurvey  for  Seismic  Protection  and  appointing  a  cabinet  minister  responsible  for  disaster \nresponse. The government has passed significant legislation and decisions to improve seismic \nrisk  reduction  and  emergency  management.7 In  addition,  design  and  construction  codes  and \nstandards  were  revised  and  updated  to  reflect  the  real  seismic  hazard  and  to  more  correctly \ndetermine the seismic loads acting on buildings and structures. \n \n5. \nThe  National  Strategy  for  Disaster  Risk  Reduction,  approved  in  2012,  defines  the \ndevelopment  of  an  efficient  system  for  disaster  risk  reduction  as  one  of  the  most  important \nfactors for sustainable development of the country. The strategy aims to improve the country\u2019s \n\nthe  government  has  reorganized \n\nthe  Spitak  earthquake, \n\nSince \n\n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  Government of Armenia. 2012.

Yerevan. \n\n\fProgram Rationale \n\nresilience  to  disasters,  increase  the  safety  of  individuals  and  society,  and  contribute  to \nsustainable development. It identifies seismic risk as a primary disaster risk for the country. \n \n6. \nMost  of  the  public  buildings  constructed  during  the  Soviet  time  need  strengthening  or \nreconstruction  to  meet  the  seismic  safety  standard.  The  government  has  prioritized  school \nbuildings  for  seismic  strengthening  or  reconstruction,  as  the  school  buildings  will  not  only \nprevent loss of life of school children but will also be used as emergency shelters for temporary \nhospitals  and  dormitories  after  a  disaster.  Armenia  has  about  1,400  schools,  about  1,000  of \nwhich  need  strengthening  and  reconstruction  at  an  estimated  cost  of  $1.2  billion.  There  are \nvarious  investment  programs  prepared  by  the  government  and  development  partners  which \nfocus  on  different  types  of  schools  (primary,  secondary,  or  high  schools)  or  different  locations \n(Yerevan  or  other  regions)  with  different  prioritization  criteria.  With  Asian  Development  Bank \n(ADB)  support,  the  government  has  consolidated  these  investment  programs  into  one  priority \nSchool  Strengthening  and  Renovation  Program,  using  the  prioritization criteria  developed  with \nsupport of the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund.8 \n \nB. \n \n7. \nThe  program  will  support  the  implementation  of the  National  Strategy for  Disaster  Risk \nReduction  by  (i)  improving  school  seismic  safety  to  reduce  casualties  and  damage  in  schools \nduring earthquakes, and (ii) enabling better use of school buildings as shelters for  the general \npublic and as focal points for emergency response after earthquakes. The program reflects the \nkey focus areas  advocated  by  the  National  Strategy for  Disaster  Risk  Reduction and  is  in line \nwith  the  four  priorities  in  the  Sendai  Framework  for  Disaster  Risk  Reduction,  2015\u20132030:  (i) \nunderstanding disaster risk; (ii) strengthening disaster risk governance to manage disaster risk; \n(iii) investing in disaster risk reduction for resilience; and (iv) enhancing disaster preparedness \nfor effective response, and rebuilding better in recovery, rehabilitation, and reconstruction. \n \n8. \nThe  program  supports  equitable  and  sustainable  urban  development  under  the  results \nframework of ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for Armenia, 2014\u20132018.9 It is aligned with the \nUrban  Operational  Plan,  2012\u20132020  in  terms  of  planning  and  investing  in  infrastructure  and \nservices for sustainable urban systems and promoting an improved environment and resilience. \nThe program is aligned with ADB\u2019s Operational Plan for Integrated Disaster Risk Management, \n2014\u20132020  and  Education  by  2020:  A  Sector  Operations  Plan. 10  ADB  has  significant \nexperience  in  disaster  recovery  including  supporting  recovery  from  major  earthquakes  in  the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China, India, Pakistan, and the Philippines, and improving school seismic \nsafety  in  Bhutan  and  Nepal.11 ADB  also  has gained  considerable  experience in  Armenia  since \nthe country became an ADB member in 2005. \n \n9. \nResults-based  lending  (RBL)  is  a  suitable  modality  for  the  program  because  (i)  the \ngovernment  has  formulated  the  School  Strengthening  and  Renovation  Program  in  which  the \nRBL program can  be  anchored; (ii)  the government  has gained and demonstrated  reasonable \ncapacity  through  implementing  investments  in  school  seismic  strengthening  and  renovation \nusing its own systems and through implementing projects funded by development partners; (iii) \nusing the government\u2019s systems will provide incentives for the government to further improve its \n                                                \n8  Government  of  Armenia.  2015.

The  strengthened  or  reconstructed \nschool  buildings  will  meet  the  internationally  accepted  seismic  safety  standards \nfor  an  earthquake  of  Medvedev\u2013Sponheuer\u2013Karnik  scale  IX.  The  strengthened \nor  reconstructed  buildings  will  also  meet  the  government\u2019s  requirements  on \nenergy efficiency, with wheelchair accessible trails and sex-segregated toilets.13 \nResults area 2: Strengthening seismic disaster preparedness and response \ncapacity. An emergency response action plan will be developed for each school \nstrengthened or reconstructed under the program. Awareness campaigns will be \nconducted  for  at  least  46  communities  in  the  same  neighborhoods  as  these \nschools (DLI 3 and PAP 10). Vocational training will be provided to at least 100 \nconstruction  managers  and  workers  to  improve  their  seismic  strengthening \nconstruction \nIn  addition, \nequipment will be provided to modernize 15 seismic observation stations. At least \n45 staff in the seismic observation stations will be trained to improve their seismic \nmonitoring and projection capacity. \nResults  area  3:  Improving  supportive  policies  and  systems  for  seismic \ndisaster  risk  management  and  reduction.  The  program  will  support  (a)  the \nreview and update of the country\u2019s building codes for school buildings so they are \nharmonized  with international  seismic safety  standards  (DLI  4  and  PAP  12),  (b) \ndevelopment of guidelines for school building strengthening and retrofitting in line \nwith  international  best  practices  (DLI  4  and  PAP  13),  (c)  update  of  the \ngovernment\u2019s  School  Strengthening  and  Renovation  Program  (DLI  4  and  PAP \n14),  and  (d)  update  of  the  probabilistic  seismic  hazard  map  and  seismic  risk \nassessments (DLI 4 and PAP 15 and 16). A financing strategy will be developed \nto  guide  the  financing  of  the  investment  needs  for  seismic  risk  management  of \npublic infrastructure in the country. \nResults area 4: Enhancing national capacity in executing and implementing \nthe  seismic  safety  investment  program.  The  program  will  strengthen  the \nArmenian  Territorial  Development  Fund  (ATDF)  for  effective  implementation  of \nthe  government\u2019s  School  Strengthening  and  Renovation  Program,  including \nproviding  additional  staff  to  the  ATDF  (DLI  5,  PAP  19),  updating  the  ATDF \noperations manual, and developing or enhancing necessary systems and reports \nfor program implementation and management (DLI 5, PAPs 21\u201333).

These  include  recruiting  and  deploying  additional  staff  for  the \nATDF  (DLI  5  and  PAP  19)  and  formulating  and  endorsing  the  government\u2019s  School \nStrengthening  and  Renovation  Program  (DLI  4  and  PAP  14).  Achieving  these  results  is \nessential  for  the  successful  implementation  of  the  program.  In  addition,  in  response  to  the \ngovernment\u2019s request to start the program implementation earlier, the RBL will finance detailed \ndesigns  of  school  buildings  for  priority  schools,  to  be  prepared  under  the  guidance  of  the \ninternational and national seismic engineers hired under the program preparatory TA. \n \n18. \nDisbursement  arrangements.  Financing under the ADB loan will be disbursed over 5 \nyears, subject to the achievement and verification of the agreed annual DLIs. The government \nwill ensure that the total program expenditures are equal to, or exceed, the total amount of the \nloan  withdrawn.14 Prior  to  submitting  the  first  application  to  ADB  for  withdrawal  from  the  loan \naccount, the borrower will nominate a dedicated account for the program at the Central Bank of \nthe Republic of Armenia into which all loan account withdrawals will be deposited. Financing for \nprior  results  and  advance  financing  is  allowed  to  address  related  financing  requirements.  The \ngovernment will refund any advance financing amount outstanding within 6 months of program \ncompletion  if  DLIs  are  not  achieved  on  or  before  program  completion. 15 Financing  of  prior \nresults will be allowed to support the government in initiating actions required to achieve year 1 \nDLIs.  Prior  to  the  disbursement  of  loan  proceeds,  the  Ministry  of  Finance  will  submit  a \nwithdrawal  application,  along  with  evidence  verifying  achievement  of  the  DLIs  in  accordance \nwith the verification protocols. Partial disbursements are allowed for all DLIs as specified in the \nDLI  matrix.16 Disbursements  can  be  deferred  or  take  place  ahead  of  the  planned  schedule \ndepending on the achievements of the DLIs. \n \nF. \n \nCapacity development activities are included in the PAP, which  has been developed to \n19. \ncomplement  the  program  results  framework  and  DLI  matrix.  The  PAP  includes  key  actions  in \nspecific technical areas, fiduciary management, procurement, monitoring and evaluation (M&E), \nsafeguards, and gender and social equity. The capacity development activities will complement \nthe  physical  investments  under  the  program  and  support  program  results  through  increasing \npublic  awareness  of  seismic  risk  and  emergency  response;  improving  the  country\u2019s  seismic \nsafety planning and management competencies; and strengthening the program management, \nimplementation, and monitoring capacity. \n \n\nCapacity Development and Program Action Plan \n\n                                                \n14  Excluding  local  taxes  and  duties;  expenditures  for  procurement  of  works,  goods,  and  services  from  non-ADB \nmember  countries;  and  expenditures  for  any  prohibited  investment  activities  provided  in  Appendix  5  of  ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard Policy Statement (2009). \n\n15  Ceilings are 25% for advance financing and 20% for financing for prior results. The combined ceiling is 30%. \n16  Given  the  meaningful  impact  of  a  strengthened  or  reconstructed  school  in  protecting  students  during  an \n\nearthquake, the minimum threshold is set at one school strengthened or reconstructed. \n\n6 \n\n \n\n\f7 \n\nTechnical Assistance \n\nG. \n \n20. \nThe  attached  capacity  development  TA  will  support  the  program  implementation  and \nguide  the  delivery  of  the  program  outputs.17 The  TA  is  estimated  to  cost  $1,000,000,  of  which \n$800,000 will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-\nV).  The  government  will  provide  counterpart  support  in  the  form  of  counterpart  staff,  office \naccommodation and supplies, and other in-kind contributions. \n \nH. \n \n21. \nThe program will be implemented from November 2015 to November 2020. The Ministry \nof  Territorial  Administration  and  Emergency  Situations  will  be  the  executing  agency  and  the \nATDF  will  serve  as  the  implementing  agency.  The  ATDF  board  will  serve  as  the  program \nsteering committee to oversee the program implementation.18 It will set the policy guidelines and \nstrategic direction for the program. \n \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nIII. \n\nSUMMARY OF ASSESSMENTS \n\nProgram Technical Assessments \n\n \nA. \n \nThe  assessment  concluded  that  (i)  the  national  building  codes  need  to  be  further \n22. \nimproved  to  meet  international  standards,  (ii)  guidelines  for  seismic  strengthening  of  buildings \nneed  to  be  developed  to  guide  proper  retrofitting  of  buildings  in  line  with  the  seismic  safety \nstandards,  (iii)  the  probabilistic  seismic  hazard  map  and  seismic  hazard  assessments  for \nschools  need  to  be  updated,  and  (iv)  the  national  seismic  observation  network  needs  to  be \nmodernized and the capacity of its staff strengthened. Overall, public awareness of the seismic \nrisks  and  the  proper  response  during  an  earthquake  remains  inadequate.  These  conclusions \nunderpin  the  result  areas,  key  actions,  and  performance  indicators  of  the  program.  The \nprogram\u2019s  design  and  implementation  arrangements  are  sound  and  the  results  framework  is \nwell designed. The program implementing agency, the ATDF, is an agency  with experience in \nprojects focused on community development targeting vulnerability and physical infrastructure. \n \nGiven the vulnerable state of the school buildings, their importance to the general public, \n23. \nand their intended use as shelters after earthquakes, public spending on strengthening school \nbuildings  is  justified.  Under  the  government\u2019s  School  Strengthening  and  Renovation  Program, \nschool  buildings  are  assessed  and  prioritized  based  on  comprehensive  criteria  including \nconsiderations  of  the  climate  change  risks  to  ensure  the  economic  efficiency  of  the \ninvestment.19 The  program  will  support  the  update  of  the  building  code  for  school  buildings  to \nensure  it  is  equivalent  to  international  standards.  Development  of  guidelines  for  building \nretrofitting  will  guide  proper  strengthening  of  school  buildings  in  accordance  with  the  targeted \nseismic  safety  standards.  The  costs  for  school  building  retrofitting  and  reconstruction  are \nestimated  based  on  the  most  effective  technical  solution.  Additional  support  for  improving \n                                                \n17    To be implemented from November 2015 to October 2017. \n18  The  ATDF  board  consists  of  the  prime  minister  (chair),  vice-prime-minister;  minister  of  territorial  administration \nand  emergency  situations,  minister  of  finance,  minister  of  economy,  minister  of  urban  development,  minister  of \neducation  and  science,  minister  of  labor  and  social  affairs,  representatives  from  four  civil  society  organizations \n(Vardanants  Knights,  Hayastan  All  Armenia  Fund,  Armenian  General  Benevolent  Union,  and  Aznavour  for \nArmenia charitable organization), and the ATDF executive director. \n\n19  Prioritization criteria include seismic hazard levels of the school locations; vulnerability level of the building types; \nthe  number  of  students;  the  age  of  the  school  buildings;  technical  and  physical  conditions;  the  existence  of \nsecondary  hazards,  including  climate  change  risks;  and  the  existence  of  buildings,  structures,  and  objects  with \nhigh vulnerability adjacent to the school buildings. \n\n \n\n\fProgram Systems Assessments \n\nseismic  disaster  preparedness  and  response  capacity,  strengthening  supportive  policies  and \nsystems  for  seismic  disaster  risk  management,  and  enhancing  capacity  in  executing  and \nimplementing the seismic safety investment program will complement the physical investment to \nmaximize the program\u2019s development impact and improve its sustainability. \n \nThe  National  Strategy  for  Disaster  Risk  Reduction  provides  for,  among  others, \n24. \nconsideration of the different but equal needs of men and women in disaster risk management \nand  encouragement  of  women\u2019s  participation  in  decision-making  processes.  The  country\u2019s \nGender  Policy  Strategic  Action  Plan  also  calls  for  gender  assessment  and  monitoring  in \nemergency situations and the provision of mechanisms and resources to mainstream gender in \nthe  management  of  emergency  situations.  The  social  and  gender  assessment  identified  the \nfollowing  gaps  and  risks:  (i)  limited  participation  of  women  in  disaster  risk  management;  (ii) \nlimited  awareness  of  students  and  community  members,  especially  housewives  often  left  at \nhome with young children and the elderly, on seismic and disaster risks; (iii) limited collection of \nsex-disaggregated  data  in  disaster  management;  and  (iv)  lack  of  systematic  emergency \nresponse  plans  in  schools  and  local  communities.  The  program  is  categorized  as  effective \ngender  mainstreaming  and  has  incorporated  social  and  gender  indicators  and  actions  in  the \ndesign and monitoring framework, DLIs, and PAP to address these issues. While the ATDF has \na  social  and  gender  focal  person,  more  systematic  gender  training  will  be  provided  for  ATDF \nstaff to further strengthen the gender perspective in the program implementation. \n \nB. \n \n25.  Monitoring and evaluation system. Responsibility for M&E is dispersed among several \ninstitutions. Most of the systems have been developed in the context of donor-funded projects, \nmainly  projects  supported  by  the  World  Bank.  Institutions  such  as  the  National  Centre  of \nEducation Technologies, the Centre for Education Project, the ATDF, and the Ministry of Urban \nDevelopment  have  reasonably  well-developed  systems  with  databases  and  management \ninformation  systems  (MISs)  largely focused on inputs  and  outputs.  The ATDF\u2019s  MIS  and  M&E \nunit needs to be modestly restructured and expanded to cater to the new  program\u2019s elements. \nThe following  actions have been  included  in the  PAP  with results  incorporated  in the  program \nresults  framework,  including  selected  DLIs:  (i)  increase  staff  strength  and  improve  their \ncapabilities  through  training,  capacity  development,  and  consultancy  support;  (ii)  provide \ntechnical  support  to  strengthen  the  ATDF\u2019s  MIS  to  incorporate  program-specific  indicators, \nincluding social and gender indicators; and (iii) develop capacity to assess quality, verify design \nand building standards, and validate technical and social assessments. \n \n26. \nin  policy-based \nbudgeting  and  budget  execution  but  weakness  in  internal  control,  quality  of  annual  financial \nstatements, and internal and external audit. The government\u2019s annual budget execution reports \nare  prepared  according  to  a  consistent  format  guided  by  Soviet-era  accounting  instructions. \nHowever,  this  format  is  not  consistent  with  International  Public  Sector  Accounting  Standards. \nAudit  is  not  fully  consistent  with  International  Organization  of  Supreme  Audit  Institutions \nstandards,  and  audit  opinion  does  not  fully  reveal  the  accounting  standards  used  by  the \ngovernment or the standards used by the auditors. There would be significant financial reporting \nand  auditing  risks  in  using  the  country\u2019s  public  financial  management  system  in the  short  and \nmedium term. To mitigate the risks, a separate program account will be set up for the program \ncovering all sources of finances, and annual consolidated program financial statements will be \nprepared and audited, applying international standards on financial reporting and auditing. \n \n27. \nProcurement  systems.  Armenia  is  a  member  of  the  Government  Procurement \nAgreement  of  the  World  Trade  Organization.  Its  public  procurement  legislative  and  regulatory \n\nFiduciary  systems.  Assessments \n\nidentified  strong  performance \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\f9 \n\nframeworks,  including  the  Public  Procurement  Law,  are  generally  consistent  with  international \nincluding  European  Union  procurement  directives. 20  Electronic  government \nstandards \nprocurement  has  been  in  place  since  2014.  Several  development  partners  are  supporting  the \ngovernment in improving the quality of electronic government procurement. The ATDF has been \nimplementing  projects  funded  by  the  World  Bank  following  national  competitive  bidding \nprocedures adjusted for World Bank guidelines. To implement the program, the ATDF needs to \nengage  additional  procurement  staff,  adopt  recommended  procedures,  develop  standard \nbidding  documents,  strengthen  its  capacity  for  technical  bid  evaluation  including  a  pass  or  fail \nstandard  for  nonconforming  bids,  update  its  operations  manual,  and  submit  an  annual \nprocurement  monitoring  report  to  the  ATDF  board.  For  schools  to  be  covered  under  the \nprogram, the majority of the procurement will be done using national competitive bidding for civil \nworks. The average cost of each contract is estimated to be $1.5 million\u2013$2.0 million. \n \nThe Guidelines to Prevent or Mitigate Fraud, Corruption, and Other Prohibited Activities \n28. \nin  Results-Based  Lending  for  Programs  (Anticorruption  Guidelines)  were  explained  to  and \ndiscussed  with  the  government,  the  Ministry  of  Territorial  Administration  and  Emergency \nSituations, and the ATDF.21  \n \n29. \nSafeguard systems. The program will trigger an environmental assessment to mitigate \nmoderate adverse environmental impacts which are typical for reconstruction and rehabilitation \nof  small  to  medium-sized  buildings.22 The  following  gaps  are  identified  between  the  national \nenvironmental system and the principles under ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009): (i) no \nenvironmental  assessment  is  required  by  the  national  legislation  for  school  buildings  of  less \nthan  1,500  square  meters,  (ii)  inadequate  enforcement  of  environmental  assessment  and \nmanagement  for  buildings  larger  than  1,500  square  meters,  and  (iii)  no  environmental \nassessment  review  framework  with grievance  redress  mechanism.  The  actions  and  measures \nto  address  these  gaps  have  been  included  in  the  PAP  and  results  framework,  including \nstrengthening  the  ATDF  to  implement  environmental  safeguard  actions  in  line  with  ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard  Policy  Statement  principles  for  environment  category  B  projects.  No  involuntary \nresettlement or indigenous peoples impact are envisaged under the program, as strengthening \nor  reconstruction  of  school  buildings  will  be  at  existing  locations  and  Armenia  is  fairly \nhomogeneous in ethnic composition. A screening checklist has been developed to ensure that \nany  program  activities  which  may  fall  under  ADB  category  A  for  environment  or  involve  any \ninvoluntary resettlement as defined in ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement are excluded. \n \nC. \n \n30.  Major  risks  and  mitigating  measures  are  summarized  in  Table  5.
