It  occurs  in  various  countries  and  regions,  including  the  Mediterranean  and  Dinaric \nkarst  regions  of  the  Balkan  Peninsula  as  well  as  the  southwest  region  of  the  PRC  on  a  large \nscale.1 In the PRC, rocky desertification is one of the most serious land degradation problems in \nkarst areas spreading in the southwest, which has a population of 220 million and overlaps the \nYangtze River Economic Belt. Karst area is susceptible to rocky desertification  because of the \nlow soil formation rate and high permeability of limestone. Where arable flat land and water are \nlimited, originally vegetated karst areas are cultivated by removing vegetation and planting rain-\nfed crops which are less effective for soil conservation. Soil erosion control is not conducted in \nmost  cultivation  areas.  Such  repeated  unsustainable  cultivation  has  increased  the  rocky \ndesertification  areas.  Climate  change  is  expected  to increase temperatures  and  the frequency \nand  intensity  of  extreme  climatic  events,  including  storms.  This  could  exacerbate  rocky \ndesertification by exposing the soil surface to warming and evaporation, and by causing physical \ndamage such as  erosion.  Rocky  desertification reduces  vegetation, soil,  land  productivity,  and \narable lands; increases natural disasters such as landslides and debris flows; and deteriorates \necology, increasing vulnerability to climate change and deteriorating people\u2019s livelihoods.  \n \nGuizhou is in the southwest PRC and has a population of 35 million, of which 36.1% is \n4. \nethnic minority. Agriculture, forestry, and fishery account for 16.3% of Guizhou\u2019s gross domestic \nproduct  (GDP)2\u2014much  higher  than  the  PRC  average  of  9.2%.  Crop  production  is  the  most \nimportant agricultural activity (10.4% of Guizhou\u2019s GDP and 64.0% of its agricultural, forestry, and \nfishery  products).  Guizhou\u2019s  total  area  is  176,167  square  kilometers  (km2),  of  which  92.5%  is \nmountain or hilly area. It has 112,240 km2 of karst areas (63.7% of its total area). Guizhou is in \nthe Yangtze River Economic Belt and is an important province to develop the southwest and far \nwest regions. It has the biggest rocky desertification area in the PRC, at 30,237 km2 (17.2% of its \ntotal area and 25.2% of the total rocky desertification area in the PRC).3  \n \n5. \nWater  is  necessary  to  change  unsustainable  land  use  and  restore  vegetation  in  rocky \ndesertification areas. In the southwest PRC, including Guizhou, rainfall concentrates during the \n\n                                                \n1   Karst topography is a landscape formed from the dissolution of soluble rocks such as limestone. \n2   Guizhou\u2019s GDP is CNY1,050.3 billion. The biggest contributor to Guizhou\u2019s GDP is industry, but its contribution rate \n\nof 31.6% is lower than the PRC average of 34.3%. \n\n3   In  Anlong  and  Nayong  counties  where  the  project  will  be  implemented,  the  ratio  of  rocky  desertification  areas  is \n\n32.4% in Anlong and 25.4% in Nayong, which are much higher than the provincial ratio of 17.2%. \n\n \n\n\frainy season and becomes floodwater that cannot be used.4 Porous limestone formations cannot \ncapture and store much rainfall. Much of the water drains into rivers quickly through numerous \nshort creeks and streams that run deep in valleys, or through deep aquifers (groundwater rivers) \nin limestone layers.5 Although annual precipitation in Guizhou (1,273 millimeters) is much higher \nthan the PRC average (622 millimeters), the amount of annual water supply per person (272 cubic \nmeters  [m3]/person)  is  about  60%  of  the  PRC  average  (447  m3/person).  To  capture  sufficient \nwater and distribute it to users in karst areas, and to change unsustainable land use and restore \nvegetation in rocky desertification areas, water storage facilities are essential.6 \n \n6. \nGuizhou  has  the  lowest  GDP  in  the  PRC  at  CNY26,444,  which  is  56.7%  of  the  PRC \naverage. The rural poverty ratio in Guizhou (18.0%) is much higher than the national rate (7.2%).7 \nThe  poor  population  in  rocky  desertification  areas  accounts  for  50.2%  of  Guizhou\u2019s  total  poor \npopulation. Rocky desertification is a main cause of the deterioration of livelihoods in Guizhou. \n \n7. \nGovernments\u2019 past activities. The central government issued the Planning Framework \nfor  Integrated  Rocky  Desertification  Management  in  Karst  Areas  in  2008. 8  Based  on  this \nframework,  different  levels  of  government  prepared  more  detailed  plans  to  address  rocky \ndesertification, including the Guizhou Provincial Master Plan for Water Resources Development, \nEcological  Improvement,  and  Rocky  Desertification  Management.9 Activities  under  this  master \nplan include the construction and rehabilitation of water storage and transfer facilities; integrated \ncontrol  of  slope  land  farming;  improvement  of  irrigation  area  and  vegetation;  and  farmland \ndevelopment,  to  increase  water  supply,  irrigation  area,  and  forestry,  and  control  the  rocky \ndesertification area. The main challenges that have emerged through past rocky desertification \nmanagement  are:  (i)  since  unsustainable  land  use  by  local  people  is  the  main cause  of  rocky \ndesertification, local people need to be involved in rocky desertification management to reduce \nthe  driving  force  for  rocky  desertification  and  ensure  the  sustainability  of  rocky  desertification \nmanagement; (ii) monitoring of rocky desertification should be conducted adequately, following \nmethods  and  frequency  set  in  advance,  to  provide  an  accurate  baseline  and  assess  the \neffectiveness  of  rocky  desertification  management;  and  (iii)  local  governments\u2019  finances  and \ncapacities for rocky desertification management need to be strengthened. \n \n8. \nStrategic fit. The project will protect the ecological environment, improve water security, \nincrease resilience to climate change, and improve people\u2019s livelihoods. It is consistent with (i) the \n\n                                                \n4   Uneven seasonal  rainfall  in  Anlong  and  Nayong  is more  remarkable  than  in  the  whole  province.  In  2014,  annual \n\nprecipitation concentrated during May\u2013September was 84.0% in Anlong and 74.0% in Nayong. \n\n5   ADB\u2019s flagship publication (ADB. 2012. Drying Up\u2014What to Do about Droughts in the People\u2019s Republic of China:  \nWith a Case Study from Guiyang Municipality, Guizhou Province. Manila) also indicated that only 33% of rainfall and \nrunoff in Guiyang (capital city of Guizhou) can be captured and kept in rivers because of its mountain terrain, karst \ndeposits, high evaporation from rocky desertification, and rapid drainage through underground channels.  \n\n6   The amounts of annual water supply per person from water storage facilities in Anlong (86 m3/person) and Nayong \n(52  m3/person)  are  much  smaller  than  the  amount  in  the  province  as  a  whole  (159  m3/person).  This  is  because \nAnlong and Nayong have insufficient water storage facilities (water storage capacities per person are 42 m3/person \nin  Anlong  and 39 m3/person in  Nayong  against  462  m3/person  in  the  whole province).  Some  70%\u201380%  of  water \nsupply in Anlong and Nayong relies on unstable resources such as rainfall, stream, and groundwater. \n\n7   Anlong and Nayong are national poverty counties located in a national pilot area for poverty reduction. The poverty \n\nratio in the project areas is 20.7% in Anlong and 20.6% in Nayong.  \n\n8   State  Council  of  the  PRC.  2008.

People affected by such pollution reduction  measures can be \nadequately compensated by establishing an eco-compensation mechanism.  \n\n16  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n17  Includes the construction of a 74.5-meter high rock-fill dam in Anlong and a 94.0-meter high concrete face rock-fill \n\n18 Water user associations contribute to efficient water use by operating irrigation facilities, allocating water to members, \n\nand providing instructions on water saving and advanced farming to members.  \n\ndam in Nayong. \n\n \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\f2,000  years  for  the  dam  and  spillway  in  Anlong  and  1 in  1,000  years  in  Nayong.19 The  two \nreservoirs will provide water for irrigation (46,980,000 m3/year, 4,263 m3/hectare [ha]/year) and \ndomestic use (44,710,000 m3/year, 493 m3/household/year).   \n \nOutput  2:  Environment,  ecology,  and  land  productivity  restored.  This  output  will \n12. \ninclude (i) revegetation; (ii) promotion of sustainable farming; and (iii) monitoring, policy reform, \ncapacity development, and knowledge dissemination. \n \nRevegetation  will  reduce  existing  and  potential  rocky  desertification  by  planting  native \n13. \ntrees  (including  fruit  trees)  effective  for  ecological  restoration,  soil  conservation,  and  climate \nresilience.  Local  people  with  land  use  rights  on  rocky  desertification  area  where  no  farming  is \nbeing  conducted  will  conduct revegetation  in the area  based  on  agreements  with  the Guizhou \nWater  Resources  Investment  Company  Limited (GWIC)  using materials,  trees,  and  equipment \nprovided  by  the  GWIC.20 The  planted  trees  and  income from  the  trees  will  belong  to  the  local \npeople, which will increase their motivation for revegetation. Consultants will train local people, \nsupervise revegetation activities, and conduct monitoring.  \n \n14. \nTo change unsustainable farming (i.e., cultivation of low-value rain-fed crops without soil \ncontrol)\u2014which is the main cause of rocky desertification\u2014to sustainable farming, the project will \nprovide  local  farmers  with  incentives  to  adopt  sustainable  farming.  Sustainable  farming  pilot \nprojects  will  include  the  construction  of  irrigation  facilities,  demonstration  of  water-saving \ntechnologies,  soil  erosion  control,  and  cultivation of  high-value  crops.  Local farmers  who  have \nland use rights on the pilot project areas will conduct sustainable farming based on agreements \nwith  the  county  government.  The  county  government  will  construct  irrigation  facilities  and  soil \nerosion control structures and purchase necessary materials, equipment, and seedlings. Income \nfrom sustainable farming will belong to the local farmers. Consultants will train the local farmers, \nsupervise the pilot projects, conduct monitoring, and promote sustainable farming (e.g., through \nonsite workshops, market surveys, and guidance to local farmers on sustainable farming). \n \n15. \nOther activities will include (i) monitoring of rocky desertification and the impact of climate \nchange, (ii) establishment of eco-compensation mechanisms for the two reservoirs constructed \nunder the project (footnote 15), (iii) protection of important revegetated areas; (iv) improvement \nof  governments\u2019  existing  policies  and  regulations,  (v)  improvement  of  existing  microfinancing \nsystems to promote sustainable farming, and (vi) dissemination of the project\u2019s initiatives.  \n \n16. \nValue added by ADB assistance. ADB will add value by introducing new technologies \nand  good  practices  in  project  design  and  implementation,  including  community  involvement. \nSpecifically, the project will (i) introduce water-saving technologies; (ii) involve and benefit local \npeople,  especially  women;  (iii)  introduce  climate  change  adaptation  measures;  and  (iv) \ndisseminate  project  initiatives.  Innovative  technologies  to  prevent  water  leakage  and  increase \nwater transfer efficiency will be used for the reservoirs and water transfer facilities, and a demand-\nbased  remote  water  allocation  system  will  be  demonstrated  in  the  sustainable  farming  pilot \nprojects.  Revegetation and  sustainable farming  pilot  projects  will  be  conducted,  involving  local \npeople, to  reduce  unsustainable  land use and  ensure  the  sustainability  of rocky  desertification \nmanagement activities. Revegetation, promotion of sustainable farming, and monitoring of rocky \ndesertification areas and climate change impact will improve climate resilience; and the project \n                                                \n19  The  design  maximum  flood  occurrence  is  the  flood  level  under  which  the  reservoir  can withhold  without  causing \n\ndamage to the main structures. \n\n20  An implementing agency that is a 100% GPG-owned company established to invest and administer projects included \nin  the  Guizhou  Provincial  Master  Plan  for  Water  Resources  Development,  Ecological  Improvement,  and  Rocky \nDesertification Management (footnote 9). \n\n4 \n\n \n\n\fdesign  has  considered  anticipated  climate  change  impacts  (adequate  reservoir  and  spillway \ncapacities, \nfor \nrevegetation).

The technical feasibility \nis  adequate  including  the  project\u2019s  compatibility  with  local  conditions  and  local  capacity  for \noperation and maintenance (O&M). With regard to the two reservoirs, (i) the sites are geologically \nstable  and  have  low  seismic  vulnerability,  (ii)  the  designs  meet  PRC  standards  for  structural \nintegrity, (iii) both reservoirs were designed for maximum safety (for the design maximum flood \noccurrence of 1 in 2,000 years for the dam and spillway in Anlong and 1 in 1,000 years for those \nin Nayong), (iv) a maintenance program and safety monitoring system will be implemented, and \n(v) emergency response plans were prepared for the construction phase and will be prepared for \nthe operation phase by the completion of the reservoirs. \n  \nB. \n  \nThe economic internal rate of return was estimated by comparing with- and without-project \n23. \nscenarios for each subproject and the project as a whole. The project\u2019s economic costs reflect \n(i) the capital cost for construction, including environmental monitoring and land acquisition and \nresettlement  costs,  and  physical  contingencies;  and  (ii)  annual  O&M  costs.  The  quantified \neconomic  benefits  of  the  project  were  derived  mainly  from  projected  increases  in  agricultural \nproduction and the value of additional water supply. The overall economic internal rate of return \nwas estimated at 9.88% and the net present value is CNY193.6 million, indicating the economic \nviability of the project. The full economic benefits of the project are expected to be substantially \nhigher, as some significant effects, such as ecological benefits, are not easily quantifiable.   \n \n24. \nThe project is not intended to be full cost-recovery, so the overall financial viability remains \ncontingent on fiscal resources of the GPG, ACG, and NCG for continuous support for counterpart \nfunding and debt servicing. It is anticipated that fiscal resources of the GPG, ACG, and NCG will \ncontinue  to  grow  in  line  with  economic  development,  providing  additional  resource  mobility  to \nfinance the project. Revenue generated from the project will be sufficient to cover O&M costs.   \n \nC. \n \n25. \nThe  financial  management  risk  before  considering  mitigation  measures  is  moderate \nmainly because of a moderate inherent risk, moderate control risk, and comparatively high level \nof  financial  management  capacities.  Measures  to  mitigate the  identified  financial  management \nrisks are in the financial management assessment.22   \n \n26. \nThe  procurement  risk  assessment  confirmed  that  the  implementing  agencies  (GWIC, \nACG,  and  NCG),  which will  conduct  procurement  through a  procurement  agency  and with the \nassistance of ADB and the consultants, will have adequate procurement capacity to facilitate full \ncompliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2015,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)  and \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time).  \n \n27. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government and GPG. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures \nare described in the PAM. \n \nD. \n \n28. \nThe  project  has  been  categorized  geographic  targeting  (TI-G)  since  the  project  area \ncomprises national level poverty counties and significant portions of the project beneficiaries are \n\nPoverty, Social, and Gender \n\nGovernance \n\n                                                \n22 Financial Management Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nSafeguards \n\nthe poor or vulnerable; and it will contribute to Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 6 through \nsustainable management of water resources, SDG 13 through climate adaptation measures, and \nSDG  15  through  halting  or  reversing  land  degradation.23 Poverty,  social,  and  gender  analyses \nwere undertaken; and adequate measures have been included in the project design to ensure \nthat local people, including the poor, women, and ethnic minorities, benefit from the project. The \nproject  will  provide  local  people  with  significant  poverty  reduction  and  socioeconomic \ndevelopment benefits. A total of 718,950 local people will benefit directly from improved irrigation, \nwater supply, fruit tree plantation, and sustainable farming. In addition, the project will create local \njobs during construction and O&M. Consultations have been undertaken with local people during \nproject preparation, and will be continued during project implementation. \n \n29. \nThe  project  is  categorized  effective  gender  mainstreaming.  It  will  provide  women  with \nsignificant benefits. Availability of water will save women\u2019s time for collecting water and provide \nthem with opportunities to conduct profitable economic activities. A gender action plan, prepared \nto address gender issues identified during the gender analysis, comprises specific measures for \nwomen,  including  (i)  the  involvement  of  women  in  the  design  and  implementation  of  project \nactivities;  (ii)  targeted  employment  of  women  during  construction  and  O&M;  (iii)  training  and \ncapacity building for women; and (iv) monitoring of the gender action plan, including the collection \nof  sex-disaggregated  data.  The  GPG,  ACG,  and  NCG  will  implement  and  monitor  the  gender \naction plan and report the progress to ADB. \n \nE. \n \n30. \nsafeguard categories are as follows.24 \n \n31. \nEnvironment (category A). The project is classified category A for environment because \nof  the  potential  environmental  impacts  from  the  construction  of  the  two  reservoirs  and  water \ntransfer  facilities  (para.  32).  An  environmental  impact  assessment,  including  an  environmental \nmanagement  plan  (EMP),  was  prepared  in  accordance  with  the  SPS.  The  EMP  includes \nmitigation  and  monitoring  requirements  and  institutional  responsibilities  to  ensure  proper \nenvironmental  management  throughout  construction  and  O&M.  The  GPG,  ACG,  and  NCG, \nthrough the PMO and project implementation units, will be responsible for the implementation of \nthe  EMP  and  compliance  with  national  laws  and  regulations,  including  inspection,  monitoring, \nreporting, and corrective actions or measures. The environmental impact assessment concludes \nthat effective EMP implementation, together with training, will result in residual impacts within the \nlimits of the PRC standards defined in the EMP. The environmental impact assessment, including \nthe EMP, was disclosed on ADB\u2019s website on 19 December 2016.25 \n \n32. \nThe project is expected to achieve environmental benefits, including a reduction of rocky \ndesertification areas; protection of the headwaters of the two reservoirs; increased water supply \nfor irrigation and domestic use, especially in dry seasons; improved ecology in the revegetation \nsites; and improved farming practices in rocky desertification areas. Environmental impacts relate \nto the construction and operation of the two reservoirs, including inundation of lands. Operational \n\nIn  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (SPS,  2009),  the  project\u2019s \n\n                                                \n23  United  Nations.

Consultations involved key stakeholders, including affected people and agencies of \nthe  ACG  and  NCG.  Mitigation  measures  developed  based  on  these  assessments  and \nconsultations include sedimentation control, revegetation, headwater protection, ecological flow \nallocations, and solid waste management. The impact downstream by altered flows is low, as the \nproject is designed to strengthen water supply, especially in dry seasons. \n \n33. \nInvoluntary resettlement (category A). The reservoirs and water transfer facilities will \ncause significant resettlement  impacts.  A total  of  2,261  households  with 7,980  persons  will  be \naffected  by  permanent  land  acquisition,  out  of  which  3,190  persons  in  678  households  will  be \nphysically  relocated  and  resettled.  A  total  of  534.3  ha  of  land  will  be  affected  permanently, \nincluding 13.0 ha of state land and 521.3 ha of collective land; 115.8 ha of collective land will be \noccupied temporarily; and 113,285.6 square meters of residential structures will be demolished. \nResettlement plans have been prepared for Anlong and Nayong following the SPS and PRC laws \nand regulations, and were disclosed on the ADB website (footnote 25). The resettlement plans \ninclude  adequate  measures  to  ensure  that  displaced  persons  are  successfully  compensated, \nresettled, and rehabilitated. Extensive consultations were undertaken with affected people during \nthe preparation of the resettlement plans, and they will be further consulted during implementation. \nLocal  governments  have  regular  grievance  mechanisms,  and  the  project-specific  grievance \nredress mechanism will be in place before construction starts. The information on the grievance \nredress mechanism has been disclosed to affected persons through the disclosure of safeguard \nplans. Costs for land acquisition and resettlement are included in the project cost. The GPG, ACG, \nand NCG will fully finance the costs for implementation of the resettlement plans. The PMO will \nengage an external monitoring and evaluation agency and submit semiannual reports to ADB.   \n \n34. \nIndigenous peoples or ethnic minorities (category B). Ethnic minorities constitute 52% \nof the direct beneficiaries of the project. The EMP and resettlement plans address the adverse \nimpacts of civil works, land acquisition, and resettlement. Other impacts will be mostly positive for \nethnic  minorities  and  other  populations.  Ethnic  minority  and  social  development  plans  were \nprepared in consultation with local stakeholders, including ethnic minorities, in accordance with \nthe  SPS;  and  have  been  disclosed  to  affected  persons  as  well  as  on  the  ADB  website \n(footnote 25).  These plans include measures to ensure that ethnic minorities participate in and \nbenefit from project activities, and adverse impacts on them are avoided or mitigated.   \n \nThe GPG has experience in ADB projects, but ACG and NCG have no experience in ADB \n35. \nprojects and their staff\u2019s capacity for safeguards is low. For the GPG, ACG, and NCG to implement \nand  monitor  the  EMP,  resettlement  plans,  and  ethnic  minority  and  social  development  plans, \ncapacity development programs for safeguards were integrated in the project design, and each \nof the PMO and two project implementation units include full-time environment, and resettlement \nand  social  officers.  ADB  will  finance  the  costs  of  (i)  project  management  support  consultants, \nincluding  adequate  specialists for  safeguards;  and  (ii)  an  external resettlement  monitoring  and \nevaluation. The PMO will implement a grievance redress mechanism and have final responsibility \nfor handling any disputes. \n \nF. \n \n36. \n\nSignificant  risks  and  mitigating  measures  are  summarized  in  Table  4  and  described  in \n\nSummary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\ndetail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.26 \n \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nRisks \nACG  and/or  NCG  do  not  construct  associated \nfacilities such as branch irrigation pipes or canals in \nareas  to  be  irrigated  by  the  reservoirs  constructed \nunder the project and a water treatment plant that will \ntreat water from Pingqiao Reservoir. \n \nForest  fires  may  decrease  vegetation  and  promote \nrocky desertification. \n \nCounterpart fund provision may be delayed. \n\nMitigation Measures \nAssurances were included in the project agreement \nto ensure ACG\u2019s and NCG\u2019s timely construction of \nsuch facilities. \n\nCounty forest bureaus will conduct patrols and raise \npublic awareness to prevent forest fires. \n\nPrice contingency  was included  in the  project cost \nand  an  assurance  will  be  included  in  the  project \nagreement to ensure counterpart fund provision.a  \n \nthe  project \nAn  assurance  was \nagreement to ensure adequate fiscal resources for \ncounterpart funding and debt servicing.   \n\nto  continue  support \n\nFiscal resources of GPG, ACG, and/or NCG become \ninsufficient \nfor  counterpart \nfunding and/or debt servicing. \nACG = Anlong County Government, GPG = Guizhou Provincial Government, NCG = Nayong County Government.  \na  Counterpart  fund provision  could still  be  delayed  (e.g.,  by too  rapid  rise in  prices  or  too  rapid  yuan\u2019s  appreciation \n\nincluded \n\nin \n\nagainst the United States dollar). \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nThe  government  and  GPG  have  assured  ADB  that  implementation  of  the  project  shall \n37. \nconform  to  all  applicable  ADB  policies,  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the PAM and loan documents. \n \n38. \nwhich are set forth in the draft loan and project agreements. \n \n\nThe government and GPG have agreed with ADB on certain covenants for the project, \n\nV. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n39. \nI am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  of \n$150,000,000 to the People\u2019s Republic of China for the Guizhou Rocky Desertification Area Water \nManagement Project, from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, in regular terms, with interest to be \ndetermined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending \nfacility;  for  a term  of  25  years,  including  a grace  period  of  5  years;  and such  other  terms  and \nconditions  as  are  substantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in the  draft  loan  and  project \nagreements presented to the Board. \n \n\nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n\n                                                \n26 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n29 August 2017\n\n \n\n\fImpact the Project is Aligned with \n\nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n\nLivelihoods of people living in rocky desertification areas  improved (Guizhou  Provincial Master Plan for \nWater Resources Development, Ecological Improvement, and Rocky Desertification Management)a \n\n \n\nResults Chain \nOutcome \nRocky \ndesertification area \nreduced \n\nPerformance Indicators with \nTargets and Baselines \n\nBy 2025 \na.
