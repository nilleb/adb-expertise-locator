I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan, \ncomplementary financing scheme (CFS) and political risk cover (PRG) to Roshan for the phase-\nII expansion of its cellular telephony network (the Project). \n \nII.  INTRODUCTION \n\"People lack many things: jobs, shelter, food, health care, and drinkable water. Today, being cut \noff  from  basic  telecommunications  services  is  a  hardship  almost  as  acute  as  these  other \ndeprivations, and may indeed reduce the chances of finding remedies to them.\" - UN Secretary \nGeneral Kofi Annan1 \n \n2.  Roshan is the largest provider of mobile telecommunications services in Afghanistan. In \nNovember 2004, ADB approved a loan of $35 million to finance the expansion of Roshan\u2019s \nmobile cellular telephony network and the restructuring of its capital base. Since inception of its \nservices, Roshan has significantly exceeded its subscriber and traffic growth targets. To meet \nthe tremendous demand, ensure quality service, and reap the competitive benefits from this \ngrowth, Roshan\u2019s capital expenditure program has had to be accelerated.2 Therefore, ADB\u2019s \nloan was rapidly fully drawn. \n \n3.  To finance the next (second) phase of the accelerated rollout plan, Roshan requested \nadditional debt funding from ADB and other current and prospective senior lenders in December \n2005. The concept of this Project was cleared on 23 February 2006, and due diligence was \ncarried out in Kabul, Afghanistan, from 5 to 8 March, 2006. Additional meetings were held in \nParis and London to coordinate the financing approach. \n \n4.  The Project involves the phase-II expansion of Roshan\u2019s cellular network to provide for \naccelerated near-countrywide coverage, additional network redundancy, and a network upgrade. \n \n5.  In early 2004, ADB approved a similar loan to GrameenPhone in Bangladesh to finance \nits phase-II expansion.3 The identified development impact included (i) continued expansion of \nthe telecommunications sector, which still had large unmet demand and unserved regions; (ii) \nexpanded  role  of  small  and  medium-sized  service  providers,  which  are  subcontractors  of \nGrameenPhone; (iii) expansion of village pay telephones (VPTs) to unserved rural areas; and \n(iv) support for GrameenPhone\u2019s unique contributions for good governance in the Bangladesh \ntelecommunications sector. The phase-II expansion financing for Roshan has a similar profile (a \nsecond loan following a rapid and successful phase-I rollout by a successful market leader in a \nnascent telecommunications market with significant demand\u2013supply gap) and rationale, and \narguably even more compelling development characteristics. \n \n \n                                                 \n1  The US National Commission on Libraries and Information Science speech at Telecom 99 in Geneva, Switzerland. \n2  If the acceleration of the phase-II expansion were not to take place, the higher-than-expected traffic and number of \nsubscribers would lead to capacity and quality concerns. Roshan would have to halt its expansion programs to \nfocus on capacity and quality upgrades. This would be to the detriment of all stakeholders and beneficiaries. \n3 ADB.  2003.

BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE, SECTOR PERFORMANCE,  \nPROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \nA.  Telecommunications Sector in Afghanistan \n6.  Afghanistan continues to suffer from a critical lack of communications infrastructure. \nTravel is impeded by poor (albeit slowly improving) road conditions, long distances, and low \nvehicle ownership rates. The postal system is still slow and basic. In a recent investment climate \nsurvey,4 26% of the surveyed firms still mentioned telecommunications as a major or severe \nproblem. The fixed-line telephone system remains rudimentary and thus communication by \nfixed-line fax is also largely unavailable. Almost everybody, including the foreign security and \nfunding agencies and the Government, depend on the cellular network for even their most basic \noperations. \n \n7.  Cellular telephony is seen not only as the only viable method of providing reliable, \ncountrywide communications coverage in Afghanistan, but also as the most attractive, because \nof the lower roll-out complexity compared with fixed-line telephony.5 Studies of the economic \nbenefits  of  telecommunications,  specifically  rural  telecommunications,  show  that  benefits  are \nbroader and benefit\u2013cost ratios are higher than indicated by the usual project economic analysis.6 \nThis is particularly true in Afghanistan, where telecommunications have become a vital part of the \nredevelopment process in the economy, health care, and security. The large external refugee \ncommunity and importance of remittances into Afghanistan from this community adds a further \ndimension to the importance of telecommunications for development. Appendix 2 gives an \noverview of the telecommunications sector in Afghanistan. \n \nB.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n8.  While coverage has grown impressively in the last 2 or 3 years in response to exploding \ndemand, it is still far from nationwide, and requires significant additional investment, particularly \nto reach the more dispersed and underserved segments of society. Current (mobile) tele-\ndensity7 is estimated at around 46 (or 4.6%). This can be compared with the 2003 (latest) data \nfor other comparable countries: Sudan at 4.7%, Somalia at 4.8%, Zimbabwe at 5.8%, and \nLesotho at 6.3%. Among all countries surveyed by the International Telecommunications Union \n(ITU),  only  Ethiopia,  Myanmar,  Guinea-Bissau  and  Eritrea  had  lower  tele-densities  than \nAfghanistan (and in 2004 when ADB commenced funding for Afghanistan, the country had one \nof the lowest teledensities in the world).8 \n \n                                                 \n4  World Bank. 2005.

Manila;  and  ADB.  1996. \nSocioeconomic Impact Study of Rural Telecommunications in Thailand. Manila (TA 2381-THA). The studies conclude \nthat the economic benefits of telecommunications are at least twice what subscribers pay for the service, and much \nhigher for some user groups. Additional benefits are derived in education, employment, agriculture, environment, \nhealth, and safety. \n7  Telephones per 1,000 people. \n8  UNDP. 2005. Millennium Indicator: 'Telephone lines and cellular subscribers per 100 population (ITU estimates)'. \nHighly developed countries such as Luxemburg, Sweden, or Switzerland have tele-densities of 170\u2013200%. The \nPhilippines had a tele-density of 31% in 2003. ", "3 \n      \nC.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n1.  Large Investment Needs \n9.  Linked to GDP, tele-density forecasts9 place achievable targets for Afghanistan at 120 \nby 2015 (a level comparable to that of Mongolia or Gabon in 2000). Most of this growth will be \naccounted  for  by  cellular  telephony  and  will  be  led  by  the  private  sector.  The  estimated \nnecessary network build-out investment (by Roshan and its competitors) is approximately $1 \nbillion.10 On average, Afghanistan will need some $76 million of investments per year to reach \nthe forecasted levels.  \n \n10.  The cellular market is served by two private cellular network operators, Roshan and \nAfghan Wireless Communications Company (AWCC),11 and the state-run fixed-line operator \nAfghan Telecom (AT). Thanks to competition and the possibility for operators to take advantage \nof economies of scale, affordability has improved significantly, and the introduction of prepaid \nsubscriptions means low barriers to adoption for a broad spectrum of users. A further cellular \nlicense was awarded in late 2005 to a third entrant, the Investcom Consortium (Investcom), \nwhich is expected to commence operations in the second half of 2006. With the addition of the \nnew operator, Afghanistan\u2019s six major cities and their surrounding areas will benefit from further \ncompetition, as Investcom is bound by a license requirement to build out these areas within 6 \nmonths of commercial launch. A fourth license12 will be acquired by Etisalat of the United Arab \nEmirates (UAE). \n \n2.  Nascent Regulatory Environment \n11.  The Ministry of Communications (MOC) is responsible for formulating sector policy. The \ntelecommunications regulatory environment is undergoing extensive reform, as state-owned \noperating companies are being prepared for eventual privatization, and the regulatory functions \nare being disengaged from the operating units within MOC. The World Bank has had a central \nrole  in  helping  establish  a  telecommunications  law  and  telecommunications  regulatory \nenvironment and has contracted long-term consultants to work with MOC and with the nascent \nregulatory  authority.  A  telecommunications  law13 (the  Telecom  Law)  was  promulgated  in \nDecember  2005,  and  a  regulatory  board,  the  Afghanistan  Telecommunications  Regulatory \nAuthority  (ATRA)  has  been  set  up  under  the  auspices  of  MOC  (it  will  ultimately  be  an \nindependent agency, funded by levies on the operators). ATRA has been formed out of the \ninterim Telecommunications Regulatory Board of Afghanistan, set up set up in 2003 as a direct \nresponse to the need for regulation thanks to the introduction of competition through the entry of \nRoshan as second operator. A regulatory sub-body, the Radio Inspection Department, has been \nestablished  (under  MOC)  for  mobile  spectrum  management  and  monitoring  of  frequency \ninterference in accordance with the standards and recommendations of the ITU.  \n \n \n                                                 \n9  Fay,  M.  and  T.

Since the resumption of its activities in Afghanistan in 2002, ADB had through to the end \nof 2005 approved nearly $1 billion in loans, grants, technical assistance, and private sector \ninvestments to support Afghanistan's development and is administering a further $82.6 million in \nfunding agency-financed or cost-shared activities, including assistance through the Japan Fund \nfor Poverty Reduction. \n \n13.  ADB funds have helped rebuild important road and power infrastructure and irrigation \nsystems in northern Afghanistan, and have promoted agricultural growth and poverty reduction \nby developing a sound policy framework and efficient sector institutions. ADB has pledged to \nconsider assistance of about $1 billion in loans and grants over the coming five years, subject to \nthe  outcome  of  ongoing  negotiations.  This  assistance  would  include  loan  and  equity \ninvestments of up to $100 million in partnership with local and foreign investors, and guarantees \nof about $100 million to catalyze private investments. Appendix 3 presents a summary of ADB\u2019s \nassistance for Afghanistan. \n \n2.  ADB\u2019s Sector Strategy \n \n14.  ADB\u2019s role in the information and communication sector, while more modest than that of \nother multilateral and bilateral institutions, includes (i) supporting the private sector, which is \nexpected  to  lead  in  developing  information  technology  (IT)  networks;  (ii)  encouraging \ngovernments to create a predictable, transparent, and nondiscriminatory policy and regulatory \nenvironment;  and  (iii)  ensuring  that  IT-related  rules  and  practices  are  responsive  to  the \nemerging revolutionary changes in the way people conduct business using IT.14 To date, ADB \nhas made private sector loans to telecommunications companies in the Philippines, Bangladesh, \nand Afghanistan. Appendix 4 gives an overview of ADB assistance to the telecommunications \nsector. \n \nE.  Corporate Overview of Roshan \n15.  Roshan\u2019s commercial expansion has been remarkable. Over its short operating history, \nRoshan has overtaken the first entrant, capitalizing on several key comparative advantages, \nincluding superior technology, greater national coverage, a strong dealer network, innovative \nmarketing, and a general reputation for quality of service and in being first mover in new \nbusiness and services.

Ownership and Management \n16.  The  majority  shareholder  (with  a  51%  stake)  is  the  Aga  Khan  Fund  for  Economic \nDevelopment (AKFED), the economic development arm of the Aga Khan Development Network \n(AKDN),  a  group  of  private,  nondenominational  development  agencies  seeking  to  improve \nopportunities and living conditions in specific regions of the developing world, especially Africa \nand Asia. AKFED also participates in a GSM mobile communications venture in neighboring \nTajikistan. In addition, Monaco Telecom International (MTI), indirectly controlled by Cable & \nWireless,  holds  36.75%,  and  MCT  Corporation  (MCT),  a  US-based  provider  of  mobile \ntelecommunications to Central Asia and Russia, owns the remaining 12.25%. See Appendix 5 \nfor more details on the shareholders. \n \n17.  The core management team has been in place since operations started. ADB has \nworked closely with Roshan\u2019s board of directors and management over the last two years. See \nAppendix 6 for brief biographies of Roshan\u2019s directors and management team. \n \n2.  Competitive Environment \n18.  Afghanistan has three mobile telephone service providers: Roshan, AT, and AWCC. \nRecently, a fourth entrant, Investcom, was awarded an additional license.  \n \n19.  AWCC  is  80%  owned  by  Telysint,  a  private  Afghan  company,  and  20%  by  the \nGovernment of Afghanistan (the Government). AWCC was granted the first operating license in \n1999. This subsequently fell into abeyance and was then effectively renewed in 2001. AWCC \nresumed commercial operations in April 2002. AWCC\u2019s network, consisting of some 150 base \ntransceiver stations (BTS), covers 40 cities in 16 provinces. \n  \n20.  Investcom  is  led  by  Investcom  LLC,  an  international  provider  of  mobile \ntelecommunications services with operations in eight countries in the Middle East, Africa, and \nEurope, listed on the London Stock Exchange. Investcom has selected Ericsson as equipment \nsupplier and expects to launch commercial services under its Areeba brand during 2006.  \n ", "6      \n21.  AT is the country\u2019s fixed-line operator, wholly owned by the Government. It has recently \nbeen corporatized. It has also been rumored that Etisalat may be awarded the fourth license to \nbe issued. AT operates a code division multiple access (CDMA) network, covering 21 provinces. \nAppendix 7 gives further details on the competitors. \n \n3.  Social Impact and Program \n22.  Since its commercial launch in July 2003, Roshan has built a national mobile telephony \nnetwork  which  is  used  daily  by  about  800,000  Afghans  across  150  towns  throughout \nAfghanistan. Roshan indirectly employs over 15,000 Afghans through its network of contractors, \ndistributors, and resellers and support businesses.  \n \n23.  In addition to Roshan's core commercial operations, which bring significant inherent \nsocial benefits, Roshan enjoys a good market reputation and brand recognition thanks to its \nsocial development efforts. It has a number of programs to benefit not only its employees, but \nthe community as a whole. In 2006, the Roshan board approved the formal creation of the \nSocial Program. The key social programs/impacts include the following: \n \n(i)  Mobile credit and/or electronic cash transfers. More people in Afghanistan \nhave mobile phones than bank accounts. The creation of a mobile credit transfer \nsystem whereby individuals can transfer value across Afghanistan to each other \nand/or to banks or money dealers licensed by the Afghanistan Central Bank (Da \nAfghanistan Bank [DAB]) could fundamentally impact how Afghans transact and \nsave and transfer money. Such a system, as well as enabling economic activity, \nwould serve the policy goals of the Government and DAB by establishing greater \nvisibility over domestic as well as international remittance currency flows. Roshan \nexpects to try out a mobile credit transfer initiative in Q4 2006.15  \n \n(ii)  Public call office (PCO) program. A program similar to GrameenPhone\u2019s \nVillage  Phone  project,16 whereby  people  without  access  to  phones  can  still \naccess mobile phone services. Roshan has some 360 active PCOs17 operated \nby individual entrepreneurs around the country. Roshan is looking to expand this \nmodel, e.g., by working with women\u2019s nongovernment organizations (NGOs) to \nroll out in the south, and by employing extended range antennas, which will \nenable  expansion  into  previously  uncovered  rural  areas  in  2006.  Through  a \npartnership  with  First  Microfinance  Bank,  entrepreneurs  can  borrow  for  the \ncapital expenditure in acquiring a PCO unit.  \n \n(iii)  Rural  telephony. The Roshan network covers about 35% of the population. \nExtending Roshan\u2019s coverage to less developed (and predominantly rural) areas \nis a priority of the Social Program. \n \n(iv)  Medical  and  health  program.  Roshan  has  started  a  state-of-the-art \nmedical/dental clinic in an unused leased building ( its former head office), which, \n                                                 \n15 While Roshan considers the implementation of a mobile credit system a high and urgent priority, issues such as \ntechnology integration, testing, and obtaining the requisite regulatory approvals from DAB and ATRA may take time. \n16 See Appendix 8 for a description of the Village Phone project. It was awarded the Development Gateway \nFoundation\u2019s first Petersberg prize for \u201coutstanding achievement in the use of information and communication \ntechnologies to improve people\u2019s lives\u201d. \n17 Not all PCOs issued are active: 130 of the active PCOs are run by former combatants through the United Nation\u2019s \nDemilitarization, Demobilization and Reintegration program. ", "7 \n      \nin addition to providing staff with access to checkups and medical/dental services, \nalso conducts training for all staff in first aid and dental hygiene, as well as \ntrauma response (for selected personnel). The clinic covers operating costs by \nproviding health services also to other organizations such as embassies and \nNGOs. Staff members pay a fee for the services but receive a monthly medical \nstipend ($15) to cover expenses. Part of the health professionals\u2019 time is also \nallocated to outreach activities, e.g., working with local and rural orphanages on \nhealth  education  and  prophylaxis.  Roshan  also  sponsors,  together  with  the \nMinistry of Public Health, training for laboratory technicians at the Aga Khan \nUniversity in Pakistan. \n \n(v)  Social welfare. Aimed at the 50% of the population which is below 15 years of \nage,  Roshan  has  a  number  of  purely  social  initiatives  across  the  country, \nincluding the following: \n \n(a)  Support for Aschiana Orphanage. The orphanage provides some 600 \nstreet children in Kabul with shelter, food, and half-day education (the \nother half of the day the children can retain income-generating activities). \nRoshan supports the activities through sponsorship (e.g., a soup kitchen \nduring winter) and through its health programs. \n(b)  Playground and park renovation. \n(c)  Textbook  and  stationery  for  orphanages  and  schools  in  northern \nAfghanistan. \n(d)  Sport and recreational events, such as kite-flying festivals and poetry \ncompetitions. Such events were banned under the Taliban and now serve \nto rebuild collective civil pride based on culture. \n \n(vi)  Voter  information  outreach.  In  2005,  Roshan  provided  a  toll-free  number, \ncomputers and phones free of charge to the Joint Electoral Management Body \nSecretariat for voters to access information on the parliamentary and provincial \nelections, providing access for the many people who are unable to travel to \nparticipate in civic education seminars. In the first 2 months, some 61,000 callers \naccessed the service. Roshan also provided technical support. \n \n \nIV.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \nA.  Project Description \n24.  The Project includes expanding Roshan\u2019s BTS network, building out a synchronous \ndigital hierarchy (SDH)18 fiber-optic microwave ring, implementing alternative power solutions,19 \nincreasing capacity in existing cities, and enhancing network redundancy. \n \n25.  In  2005,  Roshan  started  to  build  out  an  SDH  microwave  backbone  to  reduce  the \ndependency  on  very  small  aperture  satellite  terminal  (VSAT).20 The  move  from  VSAT  will \nreduce long-term transmission costs, improve local call quality and accelerate the ability to add \nadditional capacity. To cater to the projected increase in subscribers and traffic, additional \n                                                 \n18 A fiber-optic transmission system for high-speed digital traffic. \n19 Solar power is being evaluated as a replacement for diesel to power BTS sites. \n20 A small earth station for satellite transmission that handles up to 56 Kbits/sec of digital transmission.  ", "8      \ncapacity will be needed in Kabul and the other main cities. To meet anticipated increased \ncompetition in these areas, Roshan will continue to improve network quality. \n \n26.  Roshan  is  connected  with  Pakistan  via  microwave  links  for  interconnecting  traffic \nbetween Roshan subscribers and Pakistan operators. In 2006, Roshan is looking to transmit \ninternational transit traffic through Pakistan via fiber-optic cable in Pakistan, thus improving \nquality and reducing VSAT costs later. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome  \n27.  The Project will directly benefit the current users within the coverage area, through better \nand cheaper services; potential new users in areas to which coverage will be expanded through \nthe Project; and users anywhere (within as well as outside Afghanistan) able to connect to the \nRoshan network through better service, lower prices, and a wider user base with which to \nconnect.  The  Project  will  also  directly  benefit  Roshan  stakeholders,  including  dealers, \nemployees, and recipients of its social development programs. Last, it will indirectly benefit all of \nAfghanistan and its trading partners by promoting economic activity, including lower transaction \ncosts. \n \n28.  The Economist ranks the growth of the telecommunications industry as the \u201cbiggest \nsuccess  story\u201d  in  Afghanistan.  It  states  that  the  spread  of  mobile  phones  has  had  a \n\u201crevolutionary\u201d impact on business, even among local farmers, who can \u201ccheck prices before \nherding their sheep to market.\u201d 21 Roshan is considered to be one of the soundest private sector \ncompanies in the market, and the development impact of the proposed financing is believed to \nbe compelling. Roshan\u2019s phase-II expansion will have the following development impact: \n \n(i)  Accelerated, wider network coverage will help meet substantial unmet demand \nfor  telecommunications  services,  promoting  economic  growth.

In addition, the Project is expected to improve the delivery \nof services such as health care, education, and security throughout the country; \n \n(ii)  Expanded coverage to remote areas will support rural development and pro-poor \neconomic  growth.  The  project  expansion  provides  critical  and  flexible \ninfrastructure to meet the needs of small and medium-sized enterprises and the \nfarming sector where there is no access to other efficient forms of communication. \nThe project expansion will extend coverage of the PCO program to smaller towns \nand ill-served rural areas to a far greater extent than competitors\u2019 coverage.

Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n29.  Roshan\u2019s annual accounts are audited by KPMG Afghanistan. Roshan follows standard \nADB reporting requirements for its existing loan, and will continue to do so for this loan. \n \nD.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n30.  As required under the existing loan, Roshan will continue to provide quarterly expansion \nreports. ADB will monitor the expansion vis-\u00e0-vis the business plan. Evaluation of the Project will \nbe  based  on  three  levels:  (i)  the  success  of  the  Project  itself,  (ii)  development  of  the \ntelecommunications  sector  in  general,  and  (iii)  private  sector  development.  Please  see \nAppendix  1  for  the  development  impact  and  performance  monitoring  framework,  including \nrelevant performance indicators. \n \nE.  Project Review \n31.  The Project will be reviewed regularly as per standard ADB portfolio management and \nproject evaluation practice. \n \nF.  Environmental and Other Safeguard Policy Aspects \n32.  Roshan\u2019s construction works have virtually no negative impact on the environment. \nThere will be minimal cable construction, and masts will be located on existing buildings or in \nopen fields. The environmental category of the phase-I project was C, and the Project has been \nassigned the same classification. The due-diligence assessment showed that Roshan has in \nplace  satisfactory  procedures  for  site  selection  and  construction  of  BTSs,  fuels/hazardous \nmaterial (batteries) use, and disposal of BTSs and waste management (solid and liquid wastes \ngenerated  as  part  of  the  installation  of  BTSs).  Neither  the  original  construction  nor  the \nexpansion will result in any resettlement, and the Project has accordingly been classified as \ninvoluntary resettlement category C. The Project is not foreseen to have any negative impact on \nindigenous  peoples,  and  is  consequently  under  category  C.  The  indigenous  people  and \ninvoluntary resettlement categorizations are also unchanged from phase I. \n \n \nV.  THE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \nA.  Overview \n33.  ADB was first approached by Roshan and AKFED in early 2004 about possible financing \nof the first phase of Roshan\u2019s national network expansion. The phase-I expansion project was \nselected for ADB support, given the technical and financial sustainability of the business model, \nthe economic and social benefits of the Project, including environmental sustainability, the ", "10     \nunmet  need  for  medium-term  finance  from  the  commercial  market,  its  role  in  advancing \nregulatory reform, and its full compatibility with ADB\u2019s CSPU. \n \n34.  Following the completed disbursement of phase-I financing, in December 2005 Roshan \nrequested ADB and its other senior lenders, PROPARCO and SB, for further funding. Access to \nsuch additional funding would allow for a quicker response to higher-than-expected market \ndemand. Without the phase-II funding, Roshan\u2019s pace of expansion will have to be significantly \nreduced. \n \nB.  Nature and Amount \n35.  ADB\u2019s proposed financial assistance is expected to consist of the following components: \n(i)  a term loan of up to $40 million without government guarantee; and/or \n(ii)  a CFS in two tranches, of (a) about $15 million23 and (b) $5 million\u2013$15 million24; \nand \n(iii)  a possible PRG for CFS tranche 2 of the same amount. \n \n36.  Depending on the final size of the PRG, the loan could range from $32.5 million (with \nPRG for $15.0 million in CFS tranche 2) to $40.0 million (no PRG for CFS tranche 2). \n \nC.  Value-Added by ADB \n37.  It must be appreciated that any investment or loan in Afghanistan is, by virtue of the \npolitical and security environment, inherently risky. In such risky environments, ADB can (in \naddition to the direct development impact of ADB\u2019s financing) add value by mitigating other \nlenders\u2019 risk through use of its CFS or PRG products. In this way, the development impacts can \nbe amplified. In the Project, ADB will add value through the following measures: \n \n(i)  Catalyzing  further  commercial  financing  to  a  thriving  sector  in  Afghanistan. \nWithout  secure,  medium-term  financing,  mobile  network  expansion  in \nAfghanistan  will  be  constrained,  which  will,  in  turn,  constrain  economic \ndevelopment. No local debt market exists at present and offshore commercial \nand  export  credit  debt  sources  are  not  yet  prepared  to  extend  uncovered \nfinancing  to  businesses  in  Afghanistan.  Without  the  proposed  financing  and \nADB\u2019s CFS-PRG structure, it is possible that Roshan\u2019s expansion program may \nhave to be significantly scaled back and/or delayed as the commercial bank \nfunding would almost certainly not be forthcoming. \n \n(ii)  Demonstrating the continued support for a sustainable, well-capitalized, private \nsector-led, Afghan reconstruction effort success story (of which there are not \nmany),  encouraging  entrepreneurs  and  financial  investors  to  consider \ninvestments in key sectors in Afghanistan, and forcing competitors to improve \nservice offering and performance, and \n \n(iii)  Supporting a professional, well-managed and respected industry participant in \nleading  the  dialogue  with  government  and  other  stakeholders  about  sector \ndevelopment, and, in this context, enhancing the value-added that ADB has \n                                                 \n23 Amount equivalent to the remaining vendor financing (originally from Alcatel) outstanding at the date of signing \n(currently \u20ac12.5 million) . \n24  Depending on level of commercial bank interest.

The proposed loan is fully in line with ADB\u2019s country strategy and program update \n(CSPU) and the Government\u2019s strategic intentions. ADB\u2019s most recent CSPU25 reports the \nGovernment\u2019s  endorsement  of  ADB\u2019s  three-pronged  approach  to  reconstruction  through  (i) \nbuilding  capacity,  (ii)  establishing  appropriate  policy  and  institutional  frameworks,  and  (iii) \nrehabilitating essential infrastructure. Aiming at expanding the cellular communications network \nnationwide, the Project is part of the third prong. Since the Project is designed to promote \neconomic growth through improved telecommunications (benefiting all productive sectors and \nconsumers) and related spill-over effects, it is fully in line with the CSPU\u2019s assertion that ADB\u2019s \nentire public sector lending program for 2005\u20132008 will be allocated to economic growth.  The \nCSPU specifically mentions telecommunications as an area offering private sector investment \nopportunities. The nationwide coverage, focusing on rollout into rural towns, further supports the \nCSPU in that it would contribute towards \u201creducing rising inequalities in incomes in different \nregions as well as gaps between urban and rural areas.\u201d  \n \n39.  Roshan\u2019s active efforts to promote regional integration via interconnection agreements \nwith operators in neighboring countries are also in line with ADB\u2019s CSPU pledge to support \nactivities that will strengthen Afghanistan\u2019s links with its regional neighbors, and that \u201cmore \nefforts will be made to incorporate a regional dimension in loan projects, such as\u2026ensuring \nconnectivity  with  regional\u2026grids\u201d.  26 Last,  the  CSPU  states  explicitly  that  no  change  is \nanticipated in ADB\u2019s deep engagement in the telecommunications sector (via the existing loan \nto Roshan, and also through ADB\u2019s membership in the consultative group for energy, mining \nand  telecommunications),  as  \u201cADB\u2019s\u2026private  sector  support  to  the\u2026telecommunications \nsectors\u2026\u201d is \u201chighly appreciated\u201d by the Government of Afghanistan. \n \nE.  Compliance with Investment Limits \n40.  The proposed investment, ADB\u2019s fifth private sector investment in Afghanistan, would, \nonce approved by the Board, represent 2.26% of ADB\u2019s total private sector exposure,27 and \nincrease ADB\u2019s private sector investment (i) in Afghanistan from 2.14% to 4.35% total exposure, \nand  (ii)  in  the  telecommunications  and  communications  sector  from  3.06%  to  5.26%  total \nexposure. ADB's exposure to Roshan would increase from $35 million to (up to) $75 million. The \nproposed investment is within approved aggregate, country, industry, group, and single-project \nexposure limits for ADB's private sector projects. \n \nF.  Anticorruption  Measures:  Combating  Money  Laundering  and  the  Financing  of \nTerrorism  \n \n41.  Roshan has been advised of ADB\u2019s policies to combat corruption, money laundering, \nand financing of terrorism. Consistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability, \nand transparency, ADB will require Roshan to institute, maintain, and comply with internal \nprocedures and controls following international best-practice standards to prevent corruption or \n                                                 \n25 ADB. 2005.

A framework agreement was signed on 21 January 2003 between the Government and \nADB.  The  letter  agreement  contains  assurances  by  the  Government  regarding  ADB\u2019s \ncommencement of private sector operations. ADB will obtain a no-objection letter from the \nGovernment before any funding under the loan to Roshan is disbursed. \n \n43.  ADB will enter into suitable documentation, in form and substance satisfactory to ADB, \nfollowing approval (if obtained) of the proposed financing by the Board of Directors. \n \n \nVI.

Introduction \n1.  In November 2002, one year following the fall of the Taliban, teledensity in Afghanistan \nwas  estimated  at  just  0.12%,  which  is  one  of  the  lowest  in  the  world.  The  Ministry  of \nCommunications (MOC) said there were only 33,000 lines in service in the country\u2019s major \ncities, while lines in provincial and rural areas had not been considered as so few were working. \nAs a result of a complete lack of investment in fixed-line telephony since the Soviet occupation \nin 1979, Afghanistan's existing infrastructure was either neglected through lack of funding or \ndamaged in the armed conflict that spanned nearly 26 years. The capital, Kabul, was estimated \nto have just 20,150 fixed lines in the late 1990s, serving over 2 million people, with most calls \ndialed being either dropped or never connected. \n \n2.  In  a  recent  investment  climate  survey2,  26%  of  the  surveyed  firms  mention \ntelecommunications  as  a  major  or  severe  problem.  Afghanistan\u2019s  tele-density3  in  2005  is \nestimated at around 46 (or 4.6%). This can be compared with the latest data (2003) for other \ncomparable countries: Sudan at 4.7%, Somalia at 4.8%, Zimbabwe at 5.8%, and Lesotho at \n6.3%. Among all countries surveyed by the International Telecommunications Union (ITU), only \nEthiopia, Myanmar, Guinea-Bissau, and Eritrea had lower tele-densities than Afghanistan.4 \n \n3.  In  2003,  MOC  outlined  a  number  for  targets  for  the  development  of  the  country\u2019s \ntelephony sector, which are summarized below.  \nTable A2.1: Key Telecommunications Targets \nItem  2005 E  2006 E  2007 E \nFixed-Line Teledensity  0.0%  2.0%  4.0% \nMobile Penetration  3.0%  8.0%  16.0% \nInternet Penetration  2.5%  3.0%  10.0% \nNumber of Settlements \n180  3,000  6,000 \nConnected \nCumulative FDI  500  1,000  2,000 \nTelecommunications Direct \n6,000  10,000  15,000 \nEmployment \nTelecommunications \n12,000  25,000  35,000 \nIndirect Employment \n E = estimated, FDI = foreign direct investment. \n Source: TeleGeography, Ministry of Communications. \n \n \n                                                 \n1 This section is largely based on World Bank.

Linked to GDP, tele-density forecasts5 place achievable targets for Afghanistan at 120 \n(12%, or 3.5 million subscribers) by 20156 (comparable to that of Mongolia or Gabon in 2000). \nMost of this growth will be accounted for by cellular telephony and will be led by the private \nsector. The estimated necessary network build-out investment is about $1 billion.7 Current \nprivate  investments  in  mobile  networks  stand  at  some  $240  million.  Thus,  on  average, \nAfghanistan would need some $76 million of investments per year to reach the forecasted \nlevels. \n \nB.  Sector Policy and Regulatory Environment \n5.  MOC is responsible for formulating sector policy. The telecommunications regulatory \nenvironment is undergoing extensive reform, as state-owned operating companies are being \nprepared for eventual privatization, and the regulatory functions are being disengaged from the \noperating units within MOC. The World Bank has had a central role in helping establish of a \ntelecommunications law and telecommunications regulatory environment and has contracted \nlong-term consultants to work with MOC and with the nascent regulatory authority. \n \n6.  The  Telecom Law8 was promulgated in December 2005, and a regulatory board, the \nAfghanistan  Telecommunications  Regulatory  Authority  (ATRA)  has  been  set  up  under  the \nauspices  of  MOC  (it  will  ultimately  be  an  independent  agency,  funded  by  levies  on  the \noperators). This law replaced the Laws on Regulation of Telephone Services 1964, 1968, and \n2000. New salient features include provisions for regulating tariffs of operators with \u201csignificant \nmarket power\u201d, and for the oversight by ATRA of the Telecom Development Fund, the objective \nof which is to fund telecom development projects that may not be undertaken on commercial \ngrounds by the operators, funded by levies on operator revenues. ATRA was formed out of the \ninterim Telecommunications Regulatory Board of Afghanistan (TRAB), set up in 2003 as a direct \nresponse to the need for regulation thanks to the introduction of competition through the entry of \nRoshan as second operator. The Telecom Law was expected to be enacted as early as in late \n2004, but was only promulgated in December of 2005.  \n \n7.  There remains an access agenda for rural areas, a need to considerably improve the \nquality and range of services and to further reduce prices. Nonetheless, progress to date has \nbeen remarkable. The Telecom Development Fund will play a role in this area. \n \n8.  Over the past 4 years, as the telecommunications sector has continued to develop, \ntelecommunications revenues have grown to become a significant portion of the Government\u2019s \nbudget. \n \n9.  Today, the main objective of Government policy for communications is to modernize and \nrapidly expand telecommunications networks and services, and to achieve universal access to \ntelephony  across  the  country.  The  Government  is  also  focusing  on  information  and \ncommunication technologies, seeking to create opportunities for disadvantaged groups, and \ninvesting in developing such opportunities. The Government recognizes the significance of \ncreating the right conditions for open competition and private sector investment by ensuring a \nstable and transparent policy, legal, and regulatory environment.

", "Appendix 2  17 \nwere taken to establish the Telecommunications Development Fund to help support the rapid \ndevelopment of universal access in areas that may be perceived as uneconomic by the market. \n \nC.  Fixed-line Telephony Market \n10.  In the absence of any national telecommunications operators, in 2001 the MOC took \nover the operation of the country's limited fixed-line infrastructure. The ministry inherited two \nseparate fixed-line networks, one outdated analogue system dating back to Soviet rule, and a \nnewer fiber-optic network used by the Taliban. Neither network extended beyond the country\u2019s \nborders nor did they offer reliable interconnectivity, hence Afghanistan relied heavily on satellite \nconnectivity for international calls and limited data transmission, as well as for most domestic \nlong-distance services.  \n \n11.  Despite the significant domestic and international support, rehabilitation of the fixed-line \ntelecommunications  sector  has  moved  very  slowly,  hampered  by  security  issues  and  the \nabsence of infrastructure. After securing new funding from a number of sources in 2003, the \ninterim Government announced a number of emergency equipment tenders in a bid to establish \na base for launching the new fixed-line network. Among the institutions providing financial help \nwas the Afghan International Development Trust Fund, which pledged $3 million in grants, and \nthe World Bank, which approved a $22 million loan. \n \n12.  The Government\u2019s priority has been to provide backbone services, fixed mobile services \nin major urban areas and service provision in the districts. The MOC\u2019 investment program over \nthe next few years includes the following: \n(i)  telecommunications  infrastructure,  including  a  fiber-optic  ring  as  well  as \nmicrowave spurs to link towns and cities that are not on major roads, a district \ncommunications  initiative,  an  expansion  of  the  MOC-owned  fixed  wireless \nnetwork to uncovered provinces and other items, including billing systems and \nspectrum management; \n(ii)  rehabilitation and construction of facilities in Kabul, regional capitals, districts and \nairports, and hotels; \n(iii)  construction  and  operation  of  facilities  for  the  training  of  management  and \ntechnical staff; and \n(iv)  support to the regulatory and legal frameworks and restructuring of each postal \nand telecommunications operator into viable entities. \n \n13.  Although no second fixed-line operator is licensed in Afghanistan, the regulator has set \naside within its numbering plan the possibility of two further licensees. There are currently no \nplans to award additional fixed-line licenses in Afghanistan. \n \nD.  Mobile Telephony Market \n14.  Driven  by  a  competitive  market  and  $200  million  in  private  investment,  the  mobile \nfootprint covers as much as 50\u201360% of the population. Statistics on the population and size of \nsettlements  are  limited  and  unreliable,  hence,  estimates  as  to  the  penetration  of  mobile \ntelephony are approximate. Similarly, not all operators publicize subscriber numbers.  \n \n15.  Following  the  first commercial  launch  in  Kabul  in  April  2002,  mobile  services  have \ndeveloped rapidly, reaching more than 1.1 million subscribers by December 2005 and expected \nto reach 2.2 million by the end of 2006.  \n \n ", "18  Appendix 2 \n16.  Given the low penetration rate of 4.6% at the end of 2005, and the fact that 50% of the \npopulation are 15 years of age or younger, the prospects for market growth are significant. In \n2003, the MOC estimated that by 2015 there would be about 3.5 million telephony subscribers \nfor both fixed and mobile services; this estimate now seems to have been conservative given \nthe expected 2.2m mobile subscribers by the end of 2006 (which equates to a penetration of \njust 8.4%). Similarly, the Government\u2019s target of 12% mobile penetration by 2015 also seems \nconservative. \n \n17.  Confidence in the sector has resulted in significant private sector investments, most \nrecently evidenced in 2005 by the $40.1 million paid by Investcom for Afghanistan\u2019s third mobile \nlicense. Investcom is expected to launch services during Q3 2006. The significant mark-up in \nlicense fee compared with the $5 million paid by Roshan is further evidence of the confidence of \nthe private sector in the growth prospects of this market. Nonetheless, the anticipated arrival of \nInvestcom as one of two new operators should boost subscriber figures further for all operators, \nby improving market awareness of mobile telephony, and by expanding network coverage to \nnew areas. \n \n1.  Market Structure \n18.  The cellular market is currently served by two private cellular network operators, Roshan \nand AWCC and the state-run fixed-line operator Afghan Telecom. Competition has resulted in \nprice decreases, which has dramatically increased affordability to users, and the introduction of \nprepaid subscriptions means low barriers to adoption for a broad spectrum of users. \n \n19.  Both AWCC and Roshan offer national and international mobile calling, voice mail, \nnational and international SMS, and data services, on prepaid pricing plans.

Descriptions of the Shareholders \n1.  Aga Khan Fund for Economic Development  \n2.  Aga Khan Fund for Economic Development (AKFED) is the economic development arm \nof the Aga Khan Development Network (AKDN), a group of development agencies seeking to \nimprove  opportunities  and  living  conditions  in  specific  regions  of  the  developing  world, \nespecially Africa and Asia. AKDN, which has been supporting humanitarian assistance and \nrehabilitation in Afghanistan since 1996, works for the common good of all citizens, regardless \nof their gender, origin or religion. Its underlying impulse is the ethic of compassion for the \nvulnerable in society. Its programs in Afghanistan come under a comprehensive development \nagreement signed by the Aga Khan and President Hamid Karzai.  \n \n3.  For more than 50 years, AKFED has made investments and operated companies in the \ndeveloping nations of Africa, South Asia, and Central Asia. AKFED seeks to create profitable, \nsustainable enterprises through long-term investments that result in strong equity positions. This \nin turn allows AKFED to take a \u201chands-on\u201d approach by providing managerial and technical \n ", "26  Appendix 5 \nexpertise.  Profits  generated  by  the  Fund  are  reinvested  in  other  economic  development \ninitiatives under the AKFED umbrella. \n \n4.  AKFED often works in collaboration with local and international development partners to \ncreate  and  operate  companies  that  provide  goods  and  services  essential  to  economic \ndevelopment.  These  range  from  banking  to  electric  power,  agricultural  processing,  hotels, \nairlines and telecommunications. AKFED also works with governments to help promote the \ncreation of enabling legal and fiscal structures that encourage the growth of the private sector.  \n \n5.  At the invitation of several governments, AKFED has helped critical sectors make the \ntransition to market economies through privatization. These include such as banking, power \ngeneration, tourism, manufacturing, and agriculture in countries as varied as Uganda, Tajikistan, \nPakistan, and Afghanistan. AKFED\u2019s approach emphasizes the development of local human \nresources  over  time,  including  managerial,  technical,  marketing,  and  financial  skills.  Other \ncharacteristics of this approach include providing essential seed capital to launch projects in \nthose sectors and countries where attracting investment is difficult. AKFED takes a long-term \nview in order to build viable, self-sustaining, and profitable companies. It also participates in the \nmanagement of companies in which it invests with the aim of preparing companies for broader \nownership by local interests. \n \na.  Financial Services  \n6.  To encourage the creation of strong and efficient capital markets, AKFED provides an \ninstitutional  umbrella  for  banks,  insurance  groups,  and  property-owning  and  management \ncompanies in eastern Africa, Central Asia, and South Asia.  \n \n7.  AKFED\u2019s  investments  include  a  controlling  interest  in  Habib  Bank  Limited  (HBL), \nPakistan\u2019s largest private bank (acquired through a government privatization program in 2004) \nand the Development Credit Bank Limited (DCB) in India. AKFED is also the founder and lead \nshareholder in the Kyrgyz Investment and Credit Bank (KICB), which focuses on the corporate \nsector and on medium and long-term finance that will contribute to the growth of the banking \nindustry and stimulate entrepreneurial activity. In Bangladesh, AKFED is the majority owner of a \nleading provider of corporate finance and lending services to major businesses and projects.  \n \n8.  Its holdings in East Africa include the Diamond Trust Bank, which was founded in the \n1930s in Kenya to help recycle local savings into loans for home building and small businesses. \nIt  now  offers  a  range  of  retail  banking  products.  The  Jubilee  Insurance  Group  provides \ninsurance across the region. In Pakistan, New Jubilee Insurance and New Jubilee Life offer a \nrange of products.  \n \nb.  Tourism Development  \n9.  AKFED\u2019s  Tourism  Promotion  Services  (TPS)  seeks  to  develop  tourism  potential  in \nselected  areas  in  the  developing  world,  particularly  in  underserved  regions.  It  builds, \nrehabilitates, and manages hotels and lodges that contribute to economic growth and the overall \ninvestment climate in an environmentally and culturally sensitive manner.  \n \n10.  AKFED owns and manages properties in Afghanistan, Kenya, Mozambique, Pakistan, \nTajikistan, Tanzania, and Uganda, operating under the brand name Serena. Serena hotels and \nlodges  contribute  to  the  local  economy  through  the  training  of  skilled  manpower,  the \nreinvigoration  of  artisans  and  craft  industries,  and  through  sensitive  conservation  or ", "Appendix 5  27 \ndevelopment of the surrounding area. This includes placing priority on the hiring and training of \nlocal residents for employment at all levels of the organisation.  \n \n11.  TPS  often  seeks  to  develop  properties  in  less-travelled  areas  that  require \naccommodation  of  an  international  standard\u2014accommodation  that  supports  tourism  and \nbusiness development\u2014but which often are ignored by commercial hotel chains.  \n \n12.  At each hotel, the policy is to minimize the impact on the local environment while \nseeking to maximize socioeconomic benefits to the local economy. In Tanzania, for example, \nbefore the creation of new facilities in the country\u2019s national parks, four environmental impact \nstudies were carried out. The Serena Hotel in Mombasa maintains a sanctuary for indigenous \nbutterflies and also works with local residents on a program to protect sea turtle nesting sites. \nThese measures have earned the Serena hotels numerous environmental awards.  \n \nc.  Industry  \n13.  AKFED has invested in and manages over 50 industrial project companies in Africa and \nAsia. In the early 1960s, a group of companies was set up under the corporate name Industrial \nPromotion Services (IPS). Each company was created to provide venture capital, technical \nassistance, and management support to encourage and expand private enterprise in countries \nof sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. Growth, privatization and a reorientation away from \nimport substitution and toward export promotion resulted in adjustments to IPS\u2019 approach. \nExpansion into areas such as agribusiness, packaging, and infrastructure in sub-Saharan Africa \nwere accompanied by the need for new investments in the emerging economies of Central Asia \nin the 1990s and 2000s, in particular, in Tajikistan and Afghanistan. Today, IPS companies play \na vital role in local and regional economies.  \n \nd.  Food and Agroprocessing  \n14.  One of IPS\u2019 core operational sectors, agroprocessing, includes companies that supply \ngoods for local and export markets. They also play a significant role in supporting the rural \neconomy. In Kenya, for example, Frigoken provides agricultural extension services to 25,000 \nKenyan bean farmers. The beans are processed and exported to European markets. Loans are \nprovided to the farmers by the nonprofit Aga Khan Agency for Microfinance to assist them with \nfinancial needs that arise before receiving harvest revenues.  \n \n15.  In West Africa, AKFED supplies agricultural extension services to more than 45,000 \ncotton farmers, operates cotton ginneries, and exports finished products. Its social programs \noffer microfinance, education, health, and sanitation to the farmers.  \n \n16.  In addition to promoting the employment of women, these companies have become \nnational role models in matters of employee welfare, including the provision of child care and \nhealth care.  \n \ne.  Infrastructure  \n17.  AKFED  works  with  governments,  international  corporations,  international  financial \ninstitutions, and funding agencies to create solutions to pressing infrastructure needs, including \npower generation, telecommunications and water supply services. AKFED\u2019s first investment in \nthe power sector, the $225 million Azito energy project in the Ivory Coast, was the largest \nprivate sector power plant in sub-Saharan Africa. It was followed by the Tsavo power plant in \n ", "28  Appendix 5 \nMombasa,  Kenya\u2019s  first  privately  financed  \u201copen-bid\u201d  project  and  the  first  such  plant \nsuccessfully constructed under an updated and more stringent environmental law.  \n \n18.  AKFED  is  also  working  with  partners  to  rehabilitate  and  expand  a  Soviet-era \nhydroelectric  power  plant  that  will  boost  the  eastern  province  of  Tajikistan\u2019s  inadequate \nelectricity supply, reduce deforestation, and contribute to the region\u2019s economic recovery. In \nUganda, AKFED is leading the $500-million, 220-megawatt Bujagali Hydro Power Project, to \nproduce critically needed electricity for the country, and for neighbouring Kenya.  \n \n19.  AKFED\u2019s initial involvement in building telecommunications infrastructure was in Indigo, \na GSM mobile phone operation in Tajikistan. Subsequently AKFED was awarded Afghanistan\u2019s \nsecond GSM license and created Roshan which is today one of the largest employers in the \ncountry. \n \nf.  Media Services  \n20.  The Nation Media Group, founded by the Aga Khan in 1960, has its origins in Kenya\u2019s \nTaifa and Nation newspapers, which were set up to provide independent voices during the \nyears just before the country\u2019s independence. Majority owned and run by Kenyans, the Nation \nMedia  Group\u2019s  operations  include  a  growing  number  of  English  and  Kiswahili  national \nnewspapers, a regional weekly, and radio and television stations. In recent years, the group has \nexpanded its operations into Uganda and Tanzania.  \n \ng.  Aviation Services  \n22.  The aim of the aviation division is to maintain the critical aviation infrastructure in support \nof economic development. The division provides investment, management, and operational \nexpertise  and  training.  AKFED  has  taken  a  majority  stake  in  Air  Burkina,  as  part  of  a \ngovernment privatization plan designed to ensure the long-term viability of the airline. In 2005, \nAKFED launched an airline in Mali to increase capacity in West Africa. \n  \n2.  Monaco Telecom International \n21.  Monaco Telecom Group holds 36.75% of Roshan through its wholly owned subsidiary \nMonaco Telecom International (MTI).  \n \n22.  Monaco Telecom Group was created in 1997 and is the incumbent operator for the \nPrincipality of Monaco. The group\u2019s predecessor was the principality's administrative service, \nthe Office Mon\u00e9gasque des T\u00e9l\u00e9communications. Monaco Telecom has an exclusive licence to \nprovide customers in Monaco with fixed telephony services, digital mobile telephony (GSM), \npublic network interconnect services and a public payphone service; the group\u2019s exclusivity \nends in 2023. Today, Monaco Telecom is engaged in an ongoing major capital expenditure \nprogram designed to ensure that its services remain competitive and that it can continue to \nmeet all its customers\u2019 requirements. The focus within Monaco is on the quality of service while \nmaintaining pricing parity with neighbouring countries.  \n \n23.  On 18 June 2004, Cable & Wireless acquired 55% of Monaco Telecom from Vivendi \nUniversal, for a total consideration of \u20ac162 million. Simultaneously with the acquisition, Cable & \nWireless transferred legal ownership of 6% of the shares of Monaco Telecom to Compagnie \nMone-gasque de Banque, an unrelated third party. Cable & Wireless contractually retained \nvoting and economic rights in the shares as part of the arrangement. In addition, the 6% interest ", "Appendix 5  29 \nis subject to certain put and call options that, together with the retained voting and economic \nrights, provide full management control of Monaco Telecom to Cable & Wireless. \n \n24.  Cable & Wireless has also entered into a shareholders\u2019 agreement with Monaco, which \ncontains, among other provisions, a prohibition on either Cable & Wireless or the principality \n(subject to certain limited exceptions) selling their shares in Monaco Telecom for 5 years, \nmutual preemption rights on transfer of shares and certain other limited rights in favor of the \nprincipality. The principality has a put option entitling it to put its 45% shareholding in Monaco \nTelecom to Cable & Wireless at certain times after 1 January 2008. The exercise price under \nthe put option is fair market value, taking into account the nature of the minority stake in Monaco \nTelecom. \n \n25.  During the 9.5 months following leading up to the year ending 31 March 2005, Monaco \nTelecom generated \u00a3100 million in revenues and \u00a317 million in operating profit. \n \n26.  Monaco Telecom is developing its international activities in network management and \nsatellite services. Through MTI, the group has operations in Afghanistan, Algeria, Kosovo and \nTunisia. Monaco Telecom\u2019s CEO Denis Martin sits on the board of Roshan. \n \n3.  MCT Corporation \n27.  MCT Corporation (MCT) holds 12.25% of Roshan; MCT\u2019s president and CEO Richard \nSeney, sits on the board of Roshan. \n \n28.  MCT  is  a  US-based  company  and  a  leading  provider  of  mobile  wireless \ntelecommunications services in Central Asia and the Russian Federation. MCT has developed \n29 ventures in the region since its formation over 10 years ago, and today it provides mobile \nand other services through eight ventures licensed to serve populations of 67 million people.  \n \n29.  Arkhangelsk Mobile Networks began offering mobile services in the Arkhangelsk region \nin 1996, and provides coverage to the cities of Arkhangelsk (the oldest trade port in the Russian \nFederation), Severodvinsk (the center of nuclear shipbuilding), Novodvinsk (the industry leader \nof national pulp and paper production) and other cities in the region. Arkhangelsk's population is \nover 1 million. MCT offers services of voice mail, call forwarding, and direct connection with the \nservices of the city. \n \n30.

The Ministry of Communication\u2019s (MOC) fixed-line telecommunications operational arm, \nAfghan Telecom, was only separated from the ministry into an independent operating entity very \nrecently.  In  May  2004,  President  Karzai  signed  a  decree  separating  the  regulatory  and \noperational functions of the ministry, spinning off the provision of telecommunications services \nand network management into a wholly owned subsidiary, the National Telecoms Company of \nAfghanistan (Afghan Telecom). Similarly, the ministry has reoriented itself as a policy-making \nbody.  \n \n3.  On 17 August 2005, the presidential decree laying the foundation for the formation of \nAfghan Telecom was approved by the Ministry of Justice, and the operator was registered as a \nbusiness  with  the  Afghan  Investment  Support  Agency  (AISA);  the  ministerial  cabinet \nsubsequently gave its final approval. The MOC\u2019 long-term plan is to sell off stakes to private \ninvestors, both domestic and foreign, and to attract a strategic partner to manage the operator \npost-corporatization. Press reports suggest that the ministry has already been in discussions \nwith Etisalat, the United Arab Emirates-owned operator.  \n \n4.  Afghan Telecom has a presence in Kabul and all 33 provincial centres as well as 100 \ndistricts. Afghan Telecom operates a digital service mainly in Kabul, Herat, and Mazar-e-Sharif \nwhere national and international satellite links have been established. Kabul has installed a \n12,000 fixed-line digital switch with 7,000 active lines. Herat has a 60,000 fixed-line digital \nsystem and Mazar-e-Sharif has a capacity for 4,000 lines. Afghan Telecom also operates an \nanalogue network mainly in Kabul with an estimated 8,000 active lines although the switch has \ncapacity for 15,000 lines; work is under way to convert these lines to digital. There is a VSAT \nnetwork between Kabul and the four of the five \u201ctier 1\u201d cities, with work under way to expand \nVSAT connections to the other provincial capitals. The Government has expressed the hope \nthat there will be 600,000 active subscriber lines within the next 18 months. In areas where no \ntelephony services exist, Afghan Telecom plans to select local partners which will build and \noperate local networks on a build-operate-transfer (BOT) basis. \n \n5.  Pursuant  to  the  MOC\u2019  telecommunications  and  internet  policy  of  2003,  fixed-line \ntelephony licensees were entitled to provide mobile services effective 9 January 2006. Afghan \nTelecom  is  the  only  operator  positioned  to  benefit  from  this  policy,  particularly  given  the \ntechnically related procedures to transform Afghan Telecom into a prepaid mobile CDMA player \nfrom the fixed-wireless, limited mobility postpaid operation it is today. Similarly, albeit somewhat \nstrategically less appealing, mobile licensees are entitled to offer fixed services effective the \nsame date. This policy has been known to, and accepted by, the telecommunications industry \nsince early 2005. Afghan Telecom has now started providing services and carries about 22m \ncalls/month.  Focusing  on  the  Government  and  district  communications  networks,  Afghan \nTelecom services are expected to reach every provincial and district capital within the next year. \n \nB.

The license has a \nterm of 15 years and is renewable for a further 10 years. The license also requires Investcom to \nprovide  50%  population  coverage  in  Kabul  within  6  months  of  license  award  and  80% \npopulation coverage in a specified list of major cities and towns within 12 months.

Today, being \ncut off from basic telecommunications services is a hardship almost as acute as these other \ndeprivations, and may indeed reduce the chances of finding remedies to them.\" \u2013 Kofi Annan, \nUnited Nations Secretary General2 \n \nA.  What Is Village Phone? \n1.  Village Phone is a methodology that creates a profitable partnership and a channel to \nmarket to bring telecommunications services to the rural areas of a developing nation. It offers a \nframework  to  extend  telecommunications  service  to  the  rural  poor  in  countries  where  an \ninvestment has already been made in mobile phone infrastructure. Village Phone is based on a \nbusiness model that is sustainable for all of the participants and enables the poorest of the poor \nto have access to valuable communication services. Through this telecommunications service, \nrural individuals can also access information that increases their productivity, earns better prices \nfor their goods, and saves on the direct and opportunity costs of traveling. \n \n2.  By  leapfrogging  fixed  infrastructure  and  leveraging  existing  wireless  infrastructure, \nVillage Phone offers a viable strategy for increasing teledensity in developing countries and \nhelping the poor lift themselves out of poverty. \n \nB.  How Village Phone Works \n3.   Many rural villages have no telecommunications services, no public phone booths, no \nprivate subscriber fixed lines, and no individual who owns a mobile handset. People have no \noption but to travel to communicate. Studies have shown that there can be a cost to not making \na phone call\u2014up to eight times more expensive than the cost of the actual phone call. The rural \npoor cannot make telephone calls simply because there is no access, not because they cannot \nafford to or don\u2019t wish to. \n \n4.  The cost of developing and maintaining infrastructure to install telephones in rural areas \nis often prohibitive. Another barrier is the lack of a mechanism that allows telecommunications \noperators  to  interact  with  their  potential  customers,  selling  airtime  and  making  financial \ntransactions.  \n \n5.  By  their  very  nature,  microfinance  institutions  (MFIs)  have  deep  roots  in  rural \ncommunities. They are trusted institutions with detailed knowledge of the local communities and \nan existing infrastructure for regularly visiting these communities to transact financial services. \nThese  deep  community  links  are  essential  for  introducing  new  services  and  the  potential \ncontribution of MFIs to new business initiatives targeting rural communities is often undervalued. \nHere is a  \u201dchannel to market\u201d to bring telecommunications services to the rural poor. \n \n6.  The microfinance sector is historically missing from telecommunication operators\u2019 normal \ndistribution chain. By using MFIs as a channel to market, the telecommunications industries in \nBangladesh and Uganda were able to tap a market that was previously inaccessible because of \nthe prohibitively high cost of developing and maintaining a channel to this enormous market. \n \n                                                 \n1 Excerpt from Grameen Technology Center. 2005.

The Village Phone starter kit costs about $200\u2013$250 \nand includes a mobile phone, prepaid airtime card, external Yagi antenna, charging solution, \nsignage, marketing collateral, and other materials necessary to get started. The starter kit is \ncreated by the Village Phone company, which establishes relationships with MFIs to bring this \nproduct to its customers. The Village Phone Company negotiates wholesale airtime rates from \nthe  telecommunications  provider,  who  provides  access  to  existing  telecommunications \ninfrastructure for the Village Phone operators. Individual villagers in rural areas can then visit \ntheir local Village Phone operator and make an affordable phone call. \n \n8.  With proceeds from the business, the Village Phone operator contributes to their loan \nrepayment and also purchases additional prepaid airtime cards. The MFI earns money from the \nloan and also a percentage of the revenue from airtime sales. The telecommunications provider \nearns money through volume sales of airtime, and the Village Phone company earns enough \nmoney to continue to promote and expand the program.
