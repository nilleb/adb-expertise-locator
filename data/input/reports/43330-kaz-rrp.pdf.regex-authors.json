It  will  be  disbursed  in  a  single  tranche  upon  loan \neffectiveness. \n   \nClassification  Targeting Classification: General intervention \nSector (subsectors): Public sector management (economic \nmanagement and management of public affairs, social protection) \nThemes (subtheme): Economic growth (promoting macroeconomic \nstability) \nLocation (impact): National (high impact)  \n   \nEnvironment  Category C \nAssessment \n   \nThe Program  Kazakhstan  was  the  first  country  in  the  Asia  Pacific  region  to  be \nRationale  directly affected by the global economic crisis. After a decade of rapid \nexpansion at 9% real gross domestic product (GDP) growth per year, \nthe economy plummeted in the second half of 2008, limiting growth to \n3.3% that year. During January\u2013June 2009, the economy is estimated \nto have contracted by 2.3% year-on-year, and the full-year decline in \n2009 is projected at 2%, according to the International Monetary Fund \nforecast. The financial sector was the worst affected, as banks were \noverexposed to external financing sources that dried up in August \n2007  as  the  international  liquidity  crisis  struck.  Global  creditors \ntightened liquidity, and Kazakh debt spreads widened sharply. Asset \nquality in the banking sector declined. The construction, industry, and \ntrade sectors took major hits, with the impact of the crisis percolating \ndown through the entire economy. There have been major job losses \nin some of these sectors. The impact of the crisis has also had ripple \neffects on the neighboring economies of the Kyrgyz Republic and the \nRepublic  of  Tajikistan,  which  are  dependent  on  Kazakhstan  for \ninvestments as well as worker remittances. \n \nThe  Government's  policy  response  and  actions  have  been  swift. \nKazakhstan's ability to weather the crisis has been due in large part to \na considerable chest of oil earnings built up in the National Fund of the \nRepublic of Kazakhstan (NFRK), helped by the increase in oil prices \nuntil 2008. NFRK grew from $14 billion in 2006 to $28 billion in 2008. \nIn 2007\u20132008, the Government set aside $4 billion equivalent in its \nbudget to finance the ambitious ACP, formulated in late 2007 jointly \nwith the National Bank of Kazakhstan (NBK), the Financial Monitoring \nSupervisory  Agency  (FMSA),  and  other  institutions.  In  November \n2008, the Government expanded its crisis-mitigation measures with an \n ", " ii \n \nadditional  $10  billion  allocation  out  of  NFRK.  The  ACP  supports \n(i) banking sector rehabilitation, (ii) revival of the construction industry, \n(iii) greater role for small and medium-sized enterprises, (iv) revival of \nthe agro-industrial sector, and (v) greater public investment in industry \nand  infrastructure.  It  took  a  75%  stake  in  Bank  Turan  Alem,  the \ncountry\u2019s largest bank with 27% of the system's assets. It also injected \ncapital  into  Halyk  Bank  and  Kazkommertzbank.  In  total,  the \nGovernment has put into the banking system equity capital or deposits \namounting to $5 billion. Reacting to competitive pressures, Kazakhstan \ndevalued the national currency, the tenge, by 20% in February 2009. \nAn employment-generation program (Roadmap for Recovery Through \nJob Creation) was launched in March 2009. In total, the Government's \nanti-crisis package has mobilized $22.5 billion of direct and indirect \nmeasures, and is beginning to show results. \n \nThere is multi-pronged rationale behind the KCSL: \n  \n(i)  The  continued  slowdown  in  the  economy  over  the  past  18 \nmonths,  its  direct  impact  on  the  financial  sector,  and  the \nsecond-round  effects  on  real  economic  activity  have \naccompanied  and  been  aggravated  by  severely  constrained \naccess to international capital markets. While Kazakhstan has \naccumulated considerable resources in the National Fund of \nthe Republic of Kazakhstan (NFRK), the national oil fund, the \nGovernment  has  already  explicitly  committed  $10  billion \nequivalent for crisis mitigation for 2009 alone. There are market \nexpectations  that  the  NFRK  would  ring-fence  the  financial \nsector against panics. Hence, the Government would need to \navoid further encumbering the liquidity of the NFRK by limiting \nthe use of oil-sourced financial assets and revenues for short-\nterm purposes and diversifying its sources of financing.  \n \n(ii) The  economic  slowdown  has  directly  imposed  higher  fiscal \nneeds through lower tax revenues and higher social outlays. \nWith discretionary expenditure and revenue measures taken in \nmid-2009, the budget deficit for 2009 is now forecast at 3.4%. \nTo accommodate the estimated budget deficit of 3.4% of GDP, \ncertain public expenditures were compressed to allow for fiscal \nresources reallocation to rising safety net needs. The KCSL will \nhelp  the  Government  shoulder  some  anti-crisis  expenditure \nrequirements and thereby finance a part of the budget deficit. \nWithout such assistance, there may be a corresponding cut in \ncritical  expenditures  in  2009,  or  a  risky  attempt  at  tapping \ninternational  debt  markets,  which  now  price  Kazakhstan's \nsovereign debt abnormally high.  \n \n(iii) Kazakhstan needs to rebuild its profile quickly when it begins to \naccess  international  markets  again.  Engagement  with  an \ninternational financial institution could help in this regard. At a \nstrategic level, the external shocks imposed by global turmoil \nhave raised questions as to the country's ability to maintain its \n ", "  iii \npast growth record. The Government recognizes the challenge \nand has begun to focus on economic diversification. \n \n(iv) Kazakhstan is a major economy in Central Asia and a delay in \nits recovery will have effects, in terms of trade and employment \nof  migrant  workers,  on  neighboring  countries'  economic \nprospects.  As  such,  supporting  Kazakhstan's  recovery  will \nlikely have indirect benefits on other countries. \n \nImpact, Outcome,  The intended impact of the KCSL is to help Kazakhstan mitigate the \nand Outputs  impact of the global economic crisis. Its outcome will be greater fiscal \nstimulus. The principal output will be full-fledged implementation of the \nACP  and  employment-generation  program,  which  will  support  key \nsectors of the economy and generate additional jobs. \nScope and Coverage  The  KCSL  supports  the  Government's  countercyclical  expenditure \nof Loan  program  for  2009.  It  will  enable  the  Government  to  adopt  an \nexpansionary fiscal stance. As resources from the KCSL will be co-\nmingled  with  the  Government's  own  resources,  all  areas  of  the \nGovernment's countercyclical program will be included in KCSL scope.  \nFinancing Plan  The Government has requested a loan of $500,000,000 under the CSF \nfrom ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, with interest to be determined \nin  accordance  with  ADB's  London  interbank-offered  rate  (LIBOR)\u2013\nbased lending facility plus 200 basis points; a 5-year term, including a \ngrace period of 3 years; a commitment charge of 75 basis points on \nundisbursed loan balances, and such other terms and conditions as \nare substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft Loan \nAgreement.  \n \nPeriod and  The KCSL will support budgetary financing requirements related to \nTranching  ACP and the employment generation program in the current fiscal \nyear, i.e. ending 31 December 2009 and is expected to be fully utilized \nby June 2010. The $500 million loan will be disbursed in a single \ntranche upon loan effectiveness. \n   \nCounterpart Funds  The  Government  will  use  the  local  currency  counterpart  funds \ngenerated by the loan proceeds to help maintain critical countercyclical \nexpenditures, such as for job creation and restoring economic stability. \n   \nExecuting Agency   Ministry of Finance \n   \nImplementation  and  The  Government's  implementation  arrangements  for  the  ACP  and \nMonitoring  employment-generation program will be extended to the KCSL. The \nArrangements  Ministry of Economy and Budget Planning deals with the strategic \naspects  of  the  ACP,  with  NBK,  FMSA,  and  selected  economic \nministries  providing  sector  content  and  oversight.  Overall  program \nexecution  under  the  ACP  is  overseen  by  Samruk-Kazyna,  the \nsovereign wealth fund. The Ministry of Labor and Social Protection \ncoordinates the employment-generation program. \n \n ", " iv \n \nGiven the severity of the crisis and the extent of resources allocated \nfor  crisis-mitigation,  the  Government  has  put  in  place  elaborate \nmonitoring  and  reporting  arrangements,  with  weekly  assessments \npresented to the senior leadership of the country.  \n   \nProcurement and  The loan proceeds will be used to finance the full foreign exchange \nDisbursement  costs  (excluding  local  duties  and  taxes)  of  items  produced  and \nprocured  in  ADB  member  countries,  excluding  ineligible  items  and \nimports financed by other bilateral and multilateral sources. The loan \nproceeds will be disbursed to the Borrower in accordance with the \nprovisions of ADB\u2019s Simplification of Disbursement Procedures and \nRelated Requirements for Program Loans. \n   \nBenefits and  The KCSL will have a substantially beneficial impact on Kazakhstan's \nBeneficiaries  economy by \n(i)  partly meeting the resource needs of the ACP, which has \nbecome  synonymous  with  crisis  mitigation  in \nKazakhstan;  \n(ii)  creating  jobs  by  reviving  construction,  small  and \nmedium-sized enterprises, and agro industries, as well \nas through dedicated public works programs;  \n(iv)  indirectly  supporting  restoration  of  banking  sector \nstability; and \n(v)  reducing  reliance  on  NFRK  and  diversifying  funding \nsources. \n \nRisks and  Kazakhstan has withstood crisis shocks thus far quite effectively. The \nAssumptions  significant pool of oil resources and prudent fiscal management of \nrecent years have helped. While the economy is forecast to recover in \n2010 with favorable medium-term growth prospects, there are several \nrisks that Kazakhstan faces, including the following: \n  \n(i)  Slow  regional  and  global  recovery  and  uncertain \ncommodity  prices.  Kazakhstan's  economy  depends \nheavily on developments in the West, as well as within its \nneighbors,  particularly  the  Russian  Federation.  Its \nmetallurgical  sector  has  been  adversely  affected  by \nslowing  demand  in  the  region  for  iron  ore  and  other \nmetals. Kazakhstan's pace of recovery is also predicated \non oil prices and how long they will stay above $65\u2013$70 \nper barrel.  \n(ii)  Economic slowdown-induced banking distress. The \nbanking  sector  has  been  slow  to  recover,  with \nnonperforming  loans  continuing  to  increase.  Tardy \neconomic  recovery  will  slow  progress  in  bringing  the \nbanking  sector  back  to  a  sound  footing,  which  will \ncontinue to be affected by inadequate funding sources. \nNBK  and  FMSA  have  tightened  their  policy  and \noversight, but sector restructuring needs to be closely \nmonitored.  \n \n ", "  v \n \n(iii)  Banking  distress-induced  disruption  to  economic \nactivity. In the current circumstances of heightened risk \naversion and liquidity problems, the financial sector can \nrecover only slowly, limiting its ability to assist aggregate \ndemand recovery and expansion. In the meantime, any \nfurther  deterioration  of  solvency  indicators  and \ndepositors' confidence would add a new dimension of \ndisruption  to  economic  activity.  This  risk  has  been \nrecognized and acted upon by the authorities with swift \nconfidence-building measures. \n  (iv)  Inability  to  mobilize  domestic  resources.  Clearly, \nKazakhstan cannot rely on external borrowing at levels \nclose to 100% of GDP, as it does now. It is imperative \nthat  the  country  come  up  with  sustainable  domestic \nfinancial intermediation alternatives. This is a tall order \nbut one that needs to be filled. \n(v)  Governance  concerns.  Mobilizing  capital  on  a \nsustained basis will require greater transparency and a \nbetter  investment  climate.  There  are  concerns  that \ninvestors'  rights  may  not  always  be  protected  in  the \ncountry. In times like these when global markets price \nmarginal risks with great variance, Kazakhstan needs to \nattract greater investments, including investment outside \nthe  oil  sector.  Recognizing  the  problems,  the \nGovernment has taken a few important measures. It has \nadopted a comprehensive anticorruption program. It has \nalso expressed its commitment to the Extractive Industry \nTransparency Initiative. The medium-term reforms under \nthe ACP are expected to help in attracting investments. \n \n ", "", "     \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto Kazakhstan for countercyclical support. The status of the country's compliance with the \naccess criteria for the Countercyclical Support Facility (CSF) is in Appendix 1. A development \npolicy letter confirming the countercyclical spending program of the Government of Kazakhstan \n(the Government) and its medium-term development program is in Appendix 2. \n \nII.  THE REQUEST FOR THE COUNTERCYCLICAL SUPPORT LOAN \n2.  Kazakhstan's economy grew at an average rate of over 9% per year for several years \nprior to 2008. Backed by a strong growth in oil revenues, it undertook significant structural \nreforms during the past decade. The incidence of poverty declined from close to 40% in the late \n1990s to 20% in 2004 and further to an estimated 14% in 2008. Sustained growth created jobs \nand almost quadrupled per capita income over a 10-year span from 1997 to about $7,500. The \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) has been engaged with the Government since Kazakhstan \nbecame a member in 1994. ADB's strategy focuses largely on infrastructure development. \nTowards policy reforms, it has thus far provided only one policy-based loan, in 1996 for the \nPension  Reform  Program.  ADB's  private  sector  operations  picked  up  pace  in  2006,  with \ncumulative debt transactions totaling $244 million with four banks. \n \n3.  Rationale for the Proposed Loan. As summarized in the staff assessment of CSF \naccess criteria (Section III\u2013IV below and Appendix 1), the exogenous shocks caused by the \nglobal financial turmoil and subsequent economic slowdown have left Kazakhstan in difficult \neconomic  circumstances,  with  the  financial  and  some  other  key  sectors  of  the  economy \nadversely  affected.  The  Government  has  taken  swift  and  commendable  actions,  including \nformulating an ambitious anti-crisis plan (ACP). It has asked ADB for a $500 million loan from \nthe  CSF:  the  Kazakhstan  Countercyclical  Support  Loan  (KCSL).  There  is  multi-pronged \nrationale behind the KCSL:1 \n \n(i)  The continued slowdown in the economy over the past 18 months, its direct impact on \nthe  financial  sector,  and  the  second-round  effects  on  real  economic  activity  have \naccompanied  and  been  aggravated  by  severely  constrained  access  to  international \ncapital  markets.  While  Kazakhstan  has  accumulated  considerable  resources  in  the \nNational  Fund  of  the  Republic  of  Kazakhstan  (NFRK),  the  national  oil  fund,  the \nGovernment has already explicitly committed $10 billion equivalent for crisis mitigation \nfor 2009 alone. There are market expectations that the NFRK would ring-fence the \nfinancial sector against panics. Hence, the Government would need to avoid further \nencumbering the liquidity of the NFRK by limiting the use of oil-sourced financial assets \nand revenues for short-term purposes and diversifying its sources of financing.  \n \n(ii) The economic slowdown has directly imposed higher fiscal needs through lower tax \nrevenues  and  higher  social  outlays.  With  discretionary  expenditure  and  revenue \nmeasures taken in mid-2009, the budget deficit for 2009 is now forecast at 3.4%. To \naccommodate the estimated budget deficit of 3.4% of GDP, certain public expenditures \nwere compressed to allow for fiscal resources reallocation to rising safety net needs. \nThe KCSL will help the Government shoulder some anti-crisis expenditure requirements \nand thereby finance a part of the budget deficit. Without such assistance, there may be a \ncorresponding  cut  in  critical  expenditures  in  2009,  or  a  risky  attempt  at  tapping \n                                                 \n1 Appendix 3 presents a design and monitoring framework for the KCSL. \n ", "2      \ninternational debt markets, which now price Kazakhstan's sovereign debt abnormally \nhigh.  \n \n(iii) Kazakhstan needs to rebuild its profile quickly when it begins to access international \nmarkets again. Engagement with an international financial institution could help in this \nregard. At a strategic level, the external shocks imposed by global turmoil have raised \nquestions as to the country's ability to maintain its past growth record. The Government \nrecognizes the challenge and has begun to focus on economic diversification. \n \n(iv) Kazakhstan is a major economy in Central Asia and a delay in its recovery will have \neffects, in terms of trade and employment of migrant workers, on neighboring countries' \neconomic prospects. As such, supporting Kazakhstan's recovery will likely have indirect \nbenefits on other countries. \n \nIII.  IMPACT OF THE GLOBAL CRISIS2  \nA.  Economic Impact \n4.  Economic Crisis and Growth Outlook. The Kazakh economy has been struck by two \nrounds of exogenous shocks. The international liquidity crunch first (the first-round shock) and \nthe slowdown in global demand for commodities thereafter (the second-round shock) brought \ndown growth to 3.3% in 2008, against the 9% average during 2000\u20132007. Figure 1 presents the \ndynamics of these two rounds of shocks. In 2009, the economy is expected to contract by as \nmuch as 2% (Figure 2) as per projections by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), due to \ndeclining export revenues, itself a reflection of depressed international commodity prices, and a \ncontraction in private domestic expenditures. \n \n5.  First-Round Shocks to the Financial Sector. Over 2004\u20132007, Kazakh banks' lending \nhad grown increasingly reliant on international credit markets through the issuance of short-term \ndebt and cheap access to international refinancing and rolling-over options. A few big banks in \nKazakhstan also channeled these resources to banking subsidiaries in other Central Asian \ncountries  and  the  Russian  Federation.  Between  2006  and  2008,  banking sector  assets  in \nKazakhstan grew by close to 200%. In parallel, high lending growth with increasing exposure to \nreal estate (property development projects and individual mortgages) kept pushing property \nprices up. The upward spiraling of asset prices, however, became increasingly disconnected \nfrom market fundamentals and was propelled mostly by the constant growth of bank lending, \nwhich fueled speculative property demand.3  \n                                                 \n2  Appendix 1 presents a summary version of the impact. \n3  Appendix 4 outlines how the banking sector problems unfolded, and Appendix 5 presents information on ADB's \nprivate sector investments in the Kazakh banking sector. \n ", "                                     3\nFigure 1: Dynamics of the Impact of Global Crisis on Kazakhstan \nSudden  First Round  Difficulties in the \nStop in  Shocks: The  Banking Sector \nrollover of debt \nAccess to \nsyndications \nInternational \ncame to a halt \nDebt Markets \nin 2007 \n \n \nRisks of \nInduced Effects:  additional  Induced Effects: \nsharp slowdown in  economic  The decrease in \nbank lending  disruption if  private sector \ntriggers the burst  systemic  creditworthiness \nin property prices  problems occur  affects banks' \nand a collapse in  in the banking  profitability  \ndemand for non- sector  and asset quality. \ntradable output \nlike construction \nservices.\nSharp  \nReduction in \nGlobal  Economic Activity in \nEconomic  Second Round  all main sectors of \nSlowdown in  Shocks: collapse in  the Kazakh economy \n2008 and  international prices  leads to slowdown in \nand global demand  incomes and \n2009 \nfor Kazakh export \naggregate demand \ncommodities \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n \n \n6.  The onset of global turmoil in August 2007 brought about a sudden reversal in capital \ninflows. International liquidity for Kazakhstan and other emerging markets started to freeze, and \ndebt spreads widened (Figures 3 and 4). The sharp decline in asset quality and performance \nhas impaired the role of the financial sector in supporting the expansion of aggregate domestic \ndemand. Nominal credit growth to the private sector in 2008 was just 2.7%, in stark contrast to \nthe 54.7% annual credit growth in 2007 that fueled growth in real estate activity and the \nconsumption of durables. In late 2007, the self-reinforcing dynamic in property prices discussed \nabove burst, triggered by the sudden standstill in bank lending. Property prices nose-dived in \nmany  cases  to  less  than  half  of  the  peak  (Figure  5),  and  revealed  demand  for  property \nevaporated as real estate transactions nearly ceased in 2008. \n ", "4      \n  Figure 3: Credit Default Swap Rates  \nFigure 2: Annual GDP Growth (%)  for 1-Year Term Sovereign Debt \n16\n14\n2000\n12 1800\nKazakhstan\n1600\n10\nHungary\n1400\n8 nts 1200 RRuussssiaian\u00a0Federation\u00a0\noi South\u00a0Africa\np 1000\n6 s\u00a0\nGDP growth (annual %) basi 800\n4\n600\n400\n2\n200\n0\n2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 0 7 7 7 8 8 8 8 9\n-2 YR YR YR YR YR YR YR YR YR YR n\u20100 y\u20100 p\u20100 n\u20100 y\u20100 g\u20100 c\u20100 r\u20100\na a e a a u e p\n-4 J M S J M A D A\n   \n   Source: International Financial Statistics: Public  Source: Bloomberg. \n  Information Notice of Article IV Consultations, \n  International Monetary Fund. 2009.

These factors affected borrowers' ability and willingness to service bank loans, and \ncredit losses rose steeply.

Provisions for loan loss rose from \n5.9% at the end of 2007 to 31% in June 2009 (Figure 6). Foreclosures in the second half of \n2008 added real property to banks' balance-sheets at valuation levels that increasingly differed \nfrom market prices, if the latter could be established at all.   \n \n ", "                                     5\nFigure 5: Residential Prices 2005\u2013July 2009 in   \nKazakhstan (T per sqm)  Figure 6: Banking Sector Indicators \n35 2,000\n400000\n30 31\n350000 1,500\n25 1,525.00 1,497.00\n1,284.00\n300000 1,000\n20\n15.2\n250000 15\n500\n11.1 12.4\n200000 10\n8.1\n0\n5 5.9\n150000 3.2 -362.00\n0 500\n100000 4th Q 2007 4th Q 2008 1st Q 2009 2nd Q 2009\nTier 1 Capital (T billion) (RHS axis)\n50000\nProvisioning in % of Loan Portfolio, % (LHS axis)\nJan- Jul- Jan- Jul- Jan- Jul- Jan- Jul- Jan- Jul-\n05 05 06 06 07 07 08 08 09 09 Percentage of Doubtful Category 5 and loss loans in total loan portfolio\n(LHS axis)\nAstana, Secondary Market Almaty, Secondary Market\nAstana, Primary Market Almaty, Primary Market\n \nSource: Scott Holland CBRE.

Against this backdrop, the Government implemented from 2007 onwards a number of (i) \nanti-crisis measures aiming to unlock the capacity of financial intermediation in Kazakhstan to \nprovide credit to key sectors of the economy, and (ii) countercyclical measures of scaling up \npublic investments to support aggregate expenditure and employment generation. However, \nbank lending remains stagnant. The nominal growth in the first half of 2009 of 12% year-on-year \nin banks' outstanding credit is mostly a reflection of the 20% depreciation of the Kazakh tenge in \nFebruary 2009.  \n \n9.  Second-Round  Shocks  to  External  Demand.  A  combination  of  factors  strongly \naffected growth in external demand for Kazakhstan's output in the last quarter of 2008 and first \n6 months of 2009. In contrast with the nominal export expansion that occurred in 2008, which in \na direct way had mitigated the negative effects on economic growth of the 2007 sudden stop in \ncapital inflows, the collapse in international commodity prices brought down the total export \nturnover of Kazakhstan by 51% when compared with the same period in 2008 (i.e., year-on-\nyear), despite an increase in the volume of exports in the first half of 2009.4 This was a \nsignificant demand shock to the economy, resulting partly from the economic slowdown in the \nRussian Federation, a large importer of energy and metallurgical products from Kazakhstan. As \na consequence, industrial activity declined by 5% year-on-year during January\u2013June 2009. \n \n10.  Crisis  Impact  on  Private  Consumption  and  Investment.  Private  consumption \nrepresents on average more than 40% of GDP in Kazakhstan. In the first half of 2009, total \nhousehold consumption decreased by 2.2% against the same period in 2008 in real terms.5 \nInvestment expenditure (total capital formation) was also hit hard in the first quarter of 2009, \nhaving fallen by 4.9% vis-\u00e0-vis the first quarter of 2008. Investment recovered in the second \nquarter of 2009, so that year-on-year real growth in the first half of 2009 reached 7.3%. This \nreflected a combination of public and private investment, with both increasing markedly as a \n                                                 \n4  Such as in oil and gas by 7.5%, copper by 20%, aluminum by 57%, and coal by 24.1%. \n5 This reflects a decrease of 10.1% in the consumption of durable goods such as furniture (\u20138.3%), construction \nmaterials (\u201357.2%), and clothing (\u201315.2%). \n ", "6      \npolicy response to the economic crisis (described below). Spending on inventory accumulation \nand public works machinery and equipment was 1.4 times higher than in the first 6 months of \n2008. Yet, private spending on construction and building renovation decreased by 22.3%.  \n \n11.  Some forms of domestic expenditure translate directly into import demand, which makes \nit possible to illustrate further the negative shock currently hitting both private consumption and \nsome categories of investment. Comparing import turnover in the first 6 months of 2009 with the \nsame  period  of  2008,  the  total  was  down  by  22.8%,  comprising  reductions  of  28.9%  in \nmachinery and equipment and about 50.0% in automobiles. On the other hand, as a result of \nthe implementation of large public investments in transport and communications infrastructure \nand in mining, imports of iron and steel in the first 6 months of 2009 were 2.5 times higher year \non year (Figures A1.1 and A1.2).  \n \n12.  Exchange Rate and Monetary Policy Management. The Kazakh tenge was pegged to \nthe US dollar in late 2007. While this policy was maintained during 2008, speculative pressures \non the currency mounted as commodity prices declined in late 2008 and the Russian ruble \nsteadily  depreciated.  Intense  capital  flight  and  increasing  dollarization  was  an  immediate \nphenomena at the end of 2008. Foreign currency deposits of individuals almost doubled from \nJanuary 2008 to February 2009. The National Bank of Kazakhstan (NBK) intervened in defense \nof the exchange-rate peg until mid-February 2009, resulting in a decline in foreign exchange \nreserves  by  17%  between  September  2008  and  January  2009.  External  macroeconomic \nbalance conditions were reassessed by the NBK in February 2009, and the tenge was devalued \nby 20% to T150 to the dollar, and the new dollar exchange-rate peg (under a 3% band) is to be \nmaintained until the global economy stabilizes.  \n \n13.  The new exchange rate is assessed to be in line with market fundamentals. A more \ncompetitive  exchange  rate  is  showing  results.  Over  June\u2013July  2009,  the  contraction  in \naggregate demand was less steep, with several indicators of economic activity showing signs of \nstabilization, especially in mining and manufacturing. Nonetheless, and in terms of the volume \nof industrial production, the first 6 months of 2009 showed a contraction of 2.7% relative to the \nsame period in 2008, reflecting a 9.5% contraction in manufacturing, mostly in metallurgic \nproduction. The construction sector, an engine of constant and strong growth in the past few \nyears, contracted by 8.3% in the first half of 2009 vis-\u00e0-vis the first half of 2008. Kazakh \nmonetary and financial authorities have had to strike a difficult balance to restore stability in a \nhighly dollarized financial system. Their actions have been supported by accumulated external \nreserves, which have increased from $17.6 billion at the end of 2007 to $19.9 billion at present \n(the equivalent of slightly less than 7 months of imports), notwithstanding the need to maintain \nthe peg.  \n \n14.  Financial Sector Stability, and Regulatory Actions. These resources have helped \nKazakhstan deal with stress in the banking sector, which had accumulated between 2005 and \n2007 a significant open foreign exchange position, exposing it to currency depreciation. This is \nnow recognized as an important source of macroeconomic vulnerability. The erosion in capital \nadequacy in a few banks triggered by the 20% currency devaluation was taken into account, \nand  equity  reinforcements  were  required  by  the  Financial  Monitoring  Supervisory  Agency \n(FMSA). As discussed in Section IV on Kazakhstan's anti-crisis measures, the Government has \nacquired equity stakes in three top banks: Bank Turan Alem (75%), Halyk Bank (21%), and \nKazkommertzbank (20%). NBK has strengthened the capital base of the Kazakhstan Deposit \nInsurance Fund fourfold to T100 billion ($670 million). Its coverage per depositor per bank has \nbeen increased from T0.7 million ($4,666) to T5 million ($33,333). At present, Kazakhstan \nDeposit Insurance Fund reserves are considered adequate to meet short-term contingencies. \n ", "                                     7\nFurther, it has the right to borrow from NBK. In line with the 2008 Financial Sector Assessment \nProgram  recommendations  made  by  a  joint  mission  of  the  IMF  and  the  World  Bank,  the \nauthorities have adopted a comprehensive contingency plan to deal with systemic problems in \nthe banking sector. This plan has been effectively used to deal with the current crisis. \n \n15.  Banks are cautious about lending tenge due to uncertainty regarding the near-term \nevolution of the exchange rate, especially if the Russian ruble continues to slide and the \nrecovery in oil prices is not sustained. At the same time, heightened awareness of currency-\ninduced credit risk acts as a disincentive to dollar lending. As a result, financial intermediation is \nseverely  constrained.  Recognition  of  other  current  sources  of  vulnerability  in  the  financial \nsystem, such as the risk of loss of confidence, is behind commercial banks' recent liquidity \nhoarding, causing a hike in excess reserves. Although NBK and FMSA reduced the ratio of \nrequired reserves to 2.5% for tenge and 1.5% for US dollar deposits in the midst of liquidity \nproblems in two large banks, the total amount of reserves in the banking system has actually \nincreased. NBK attempted to relieve credit constraints by lowering the interbank rate from \n10.5% in December 2008 to 7.5% in July 2009. This move currently appears to support banks in \nthe process of restructuring, while the remaining banks have yet to avail themselves of the NBK \nlending window. Continued close coordination is vital between monetary and exchange rate \npolicies and financial sector oversight. \n \n16.  NBK has set a positive precedent in previous episodes of banking difficulties by honoring \nits commitment to treat banks firmly but fairly.6 FMSA has increased its monitoring and oversight. \nIt examines bank financials monthly, conducts modified stress tests regularly, and is preparing \nnew prudential guidelines that are expected to be in force once the current round of international \ncreditor  negotiations  is  completed.  FMSA's  undivided  attention  is  now  on  the  systemically \nimportant banks that need significant asset restructuring and creditor workouts, as related \nGovernment programs take shape. \n \n17.  Fiscal Impact. Kazakhstan's fiscal management became stronger as the economy grew \nover the past decade. NFRK, established in August 2000, has consolidated all revenues from \nthe extractive sector and has been used prudently, generally to meet social safety net needs or \nprovide funding to national development institutions. The severity of the crisis has necessitated \nlarge transfers and commitments from NFRK.  \n \n18.  As for 2009, revenue compression is inevitable (Table 1). Estimates of tax revenues in \nthe Republican Budget (which consists of non-oil tax revenues) for 2009 have already been \nreduced by 12% compared with 2008, as the tax code provided tax easing as a crisis response. \nHowever, non-oil tax revenue was further cut by another 20% during the April 2009 budget \nrevisions, as the economy contracted in the first quarter, reflecting weak business activity and \nconsumer demand. Tax and non-tax revenues from oil enterprises, which accrue directly into \nNFRK, have also declined. January\u2013August 2009 oil revenues declined by 28% compared with \nthe same period in 2008, from T955 billion to T683 billion.7  \n \n                                                 \n6  During the banking crisis of 1995\u20131996, NBK demonstrated that banking rules were not negotiable. Among other \nactions, NBK closed Kramds, one of the largest banks in the country, and forced the merger of two large state-\nowned banks, Turan and Alem. NBK established the credibility of the deposit insurance program by ensuring that \ndepositors in Komir, the first failed bank, were promptly reimbursed in 2002. An important contrast was the \nexperience of Business Bank, which was not a participant in the deposit insurance program and whose depositors \nwere not reimbursed. \n7  These figures exclude investment income from NFRK fund management.  \n ", "8      \n19.  To alleviate the shortfall in revenues in the budget, the Government has tapped NFRK to \nprovide resources through increased targeted transfers. From zero targeted transfers in the \noriginal 2009 budget, the revised budget reflects targeted transfers of T347.9 billion ($2.3 billion) \nto cushion the fall in revenues. As such, the total revenue decline is cushioned and limited to \n1%. This allowed the Government to limit the aggregate expenditure compression and maintain \nthe 3.4% budget deficit target. \n \nTable 1: Republican Budget (T billion) \n \n     2009 Budget \n Item  2008 Actual  Original  Revised \nTotal Revenues  3,331.0  2,860.9  2,837.4 \nRevenuesa  2,152.8  1,900.7  1,529.5 \n  Tax  2,071.4  1,827.4  1,455.6 \n  Nontax  72.8  55.3  58.8 \n  Income from Sale of Fixed Assets  8.6  18.0  15.1 \nWithdrawals/Returns of Transfers  92.4  101.6  101.4 \nRepayment of Budget Loans  13.3  14.0  14.0 \nSales of Financial Assets  0.1  1.5  1.5 \nGuaranteed Transfers from NFRK  464.9  843.1  843.1 \nTargeted Transfers from NFRK  607.5    347.9 \nExpenditures  3,658.4  3,432.2  3,411.0 \n         \nBudget Balance  (327.4)  (571.3)  (573.6) \n   As % of GDP  (2.1)  -3.4)  (3.4) \n( ) = negative, GDP = gross domestic product, NBK = National Bank of Kazakhstan \na  Excludes oil revenues.

Fiscal Management: Kazakhstan's fiscal position is likely to weather the current crisis \nand is expected to improve starting 2011. Under its medium-term budget framework, the fiscal \ndeficit is expected to narrow in 2011 (Figure 7).8 The fiscal stimulus is expected to be carried on \nuntil 2010, with the fiscal deficit slightly up to 3.5% of GDP. Revenue effort, after registering a \ndrop of 4% between 2008 and 2009, is expected to remain steady until 2011(Figure 8). This is \nto be achieved despite the reduction in corporate income taxes from 20% in 2009 to 15% in \n2011. Non-oil revenues are expected to improve as the Government diversifies the economy. \nTransfers from NFRK are to be slightly less in 2010\u20132011 compared to 2009, with no planned \nspecial funding (i.e., targeted transfers) of anti-crisis measures by NFRK. While development \nand recurrent expenditures are expected to increase by 23% and 10%, respectively, in 2010, \nthe expenditure-to-GDP ratio is expected to be maintained at around the 2009 level (Figure 9). \nThis will continue fiscal support for the economic recovery. Fiscal consolidation will start in 2011, \nwith expenditure-to-GDP ratio projected to fall slightly below the 2007 level. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n8  Fiscal data in this section are based on discussion the Government. \n ", "                                     9\n \n \nFigure 7: Fiscal Balance  (% of GDP)  Figure 8: Revenue (% of GDP) \n0.0 25.0\n2007 2008 2009 2010 2011\n-0.5\n20.0\n-1.0\n15.0\n-1.5\n-2.0 10.0\n-2.5\n5.0\n-3.0\n0.0\n-3.5 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011\nTotal revenues Non-oil revenues Transfers from NFRK\nSource: Ministry of Economy and Budget Planning\n-4.0\nGDP = gross domestic product, NFRK = National Fund \nSource: Ministry of Economy and Budget Planning.  \nof the Republic of Kazakhstan. \nGDP = gross domestic product. \nFigure 9 - Expenditures (% of GDP) \n25.0\n20.0\n15.0\n10.0\n5.0\n0.0\n2007 2008 2009 2010 2011\nTotal expenditures Current expenditures Capital expenditures\n  Source: Ministry of Economy and Budget Planning  \n      GDP = gross domestic product. \n \nB.  Social Impact of the Crisis9 \n \n21.  Poverty  in  Kazakhstan.10 On  the  back  of  an  economy  posting  strong  growth, \nKazakhstan has made rapid progress in poverty reduction. In 1998, the incidence of poverty\u2014\nmeasured  as  the  proportion  of  the  population  living  below  a  stipulated  minimum  resource \nrequirement11\u2014was 39%. This declined to 20% in 2004. It is estimated to have declined further \nto 14% in 2008. Survey figures are not available for 2008, and there is no data for 2009 yet. As \na result, the impact of the crisis on poverty incidence has not yet been assessed. There is \nindirect evidence\u2014from the number of people applying for social assistance\u2014that the crisis has \n                                                 \n9   Appendix 6 presents the summary poverty reduction and social strategy for the proposed loan. \n10  ADB has been closely engaged with the Government in monitoring poverty. It supported the establishment of the \nPoverty Reduction Department in the Ministry of Labor and Social Welfare and helped formulate the poverty-\nreduction program for 2003\u20132005. \n11  The poverty line in Kazakhstan is based on the minimum that a person would need for subsistence. This is \ncomputed as the cost of a food basket providing 2,172 kilocalories of nutrition per day plus an additional 40% of the \ncost of such a basket to cover other expenses. On 1 January 2009, the subsistence minimum was established at \nT13,717 (about $90.90) per person per month. In 2004, for instance, the subsistence minimum requirement was \nestimated at $41.75 per month per person. Source: Argawal, Pradeep. 2007. Economic Growth and Poverty \nReduction\u2014Evidence from Kazakhstan. Asian Development Review 24(2):90\u2013115. \n ", "10     \nnot yet pushed more people into poverty. Either because automatic unemployment insurance \nschemes  or  employment-inducing fiscal  stimulus  responses  have  been  effective  so  far,  or \nsimply because poverty impacts from economic slowdowns tend to lag, it has been difficult to \ndiscern concrete poverty effects from the crisis. The Government is continuously monitoring the \nsituation. \n \n22.  Kazakhstan\u2019s Social Assistance Program provides minimum welfare support to those \nindividuals defined as ultra poor, with an income equivalent to 40% of the subsistence minimum \nor less. In 2009, the ultra poor threshold was T5,487 ($36.40) per month, or just over $1 per \nperson per day (footnote 9). In 2008, 244,000 individuals applied for targeted support under the \nSocial Assistance Program. In the first 6 months of 2009, 90,000 individual applied for such \nassistance. If this trend continues, the annual total of applicants for social assistance may in fact \ndecline. However, it is quite likely that the impact of the crisis has not really percolated yet from \nurban Kazakhstan into rural areas.  Further, coverage under the Social Assistance Program can \nbe at best only a crude proxy, as there are concerns that many of the ultra poor may not apply \nfor  assistance  for  lack  of  awareness  of  it  or  because  of  cumbersome  documentation \nrequirements. \n \n23.  Unemployment. As discussed above, the economic sectors that suffered most from the \ncontraction in the first half of 2009 were such labor-intensive ones as construction services, \nmetallurgy, and mining. Together these sectors account for a significant share of the economy \nand employ close to 25% of the active labor force (comprising 65% men and 35% women). The \nofficial unemployment rate was around 6.5% at the end of the second half of 2008, it went up to \n7.2% by April 2009, and has since come down to 6.7% as measured at the end of June 2009, \nwhich  may  also  reflect  the  launching  of  the  Government's  direct  employment-generation \nprogram. However, it is likely that there may be a lag for the full-scale impact of the crisis to filter \nthrough into layoffs. At the same time, there are clear signs of vulnerability. For instance, the \nnumber of applicants seeking unemployment insurance benefits has increased sharply, from \n567 claimants in 2007 to 1,712 in 2008 and to 8,882 in the first half of 2009. \n \n24.  Gender. The economic crisis has affected people generally in Kazakhstan. An analysis \nof the distribution of employment by gender across economic activities indicates that there are \nfewer women than men employed in the sectors that were hit hardest by the crisis (Table A7 in \nAppendix 6). For example, among the hardest hit economic activities are manufacturing (-11.5% \ngrowth  in  January\u2013May  2009),  construction  (-8.3%);  transport  and  communication  (-7.9%); \npower distribution and water supply (-7.6%); and trade (-6.8%). Except for trade, all have a \nhigher share of men employed, ranging from 63% to 75%. Although the worst-affected sectors \npredominantly  employ  male  workers,  studies  from  the  1997  Asian  financial  crisis  highlight \nsituations where women may be discriminated against in layoff decisions.  \n \n25.  There is no evidence yet of any disproportionate effects on women when compared with \nmen. However, there may be some time lag before the emergence of a clear indication of crisis \nimpact on women. The gender gap in wages is around 40% and men are also said to have \nbenefited  more  from  economic  progress  in  previous  years.12 Therefore,  given  women\u2019s \nvulnerability  to  poverty,  any  increases  in  unemployment  among  women  could  have  a \ndisproportionate impact on women\u2019s poverty levels. \n \n26.  Kazakhstan has had a relatively good record in gender equality and related issues. The \nOrganisation  for  Economic  Cooperation  and  Development  (OECD)  Social  Institutions  and \n                                                 \n12 Asian Development Bank. 2006.

Several initiatives have been undertaken by the \nGovernment to improve equality among men and women. In 2003, the Concept on Gender \nPolicy was approved. This was followed by the adoption of the Strategy for Gender Equality for \n2006\u20132016,  which  provides  guidance  on  the  tasks  needed  to  achieve  equal  rights  and \nopportunities for men and women. The first action plan for 2006\u20132008 of the strategy has been \ncompleted and a new action plan for 2009\u20132011 is being implemented. Annual gender statistics \nare published by the Agency of Statistics. \n \nIV.  GOVERNMENT'S CRISIS MITIGATION MEASURES \n \n27.  The Government has swiftly responded to the crisis, as it began to unfold since late \n2007 in banking, construction, industries, and agriculture. It adopted the first ACP in November \n2007 for 2007-2008,14 and allocated $3.5 billion from the national Republican and local budgets, \nto help real estate developers, small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and the agro-industrial \nsector. In 2008, it established the Distressed Asset Fund with a capitalization of $583.7 million \nfrom the Republican Budget.  \n \n28.  As Kazakhstan's economic crisis became deeper due to the global economic crisis in \nlate 2008 and the decline in oil and other commodity prices, the Government unveiled additional \ncrisis-mitigation measures, including: (i) cuts in taxes and reserve requirements,15 (ii) the ACP \nfor  2009\u2013201016 funded  with  $10  billion  from  NFRK,  and  (iii)  an  employment-generation \nprogram17 funded  with  $1.3  billion  from  the  Republican  Budget  (through  targeted  NFRK \ntransfers) and local budgets. Measures in these packages are classified under: (i) financial \nsector stabilization; and (ii) economic revival and social safety nets. Figure 10 summarizes the \nresource  allocation  for and  disbursement  to  these  two  categories.  The  Government's  total \nfunding commitment to date, excluding its estimate of the impact of the tax cuts, amounts to \n$15.4 billion. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n13  The Social Institutions and Gender Index is a new composite measure of gender discrimination based on social \ninstitutions. It measures gender inequality in five areas: family code, physical integrity, son preference, civil \nliberties, and ownership rights.

Anti-Crisis  Plan  for  2009\u20132010.  The  ACP,  adopted  in  November  2008,  aims  at \nmacroeconomic stabilization and mitigating the adverse social impact. The principal goal of the \nACP is to revive economic activity by relieving financing constraints, resulting in net job creation. \nThe plan has five components: (i) stabilization of the financial sector, (ii) revival of the real \nestate market, (iii) support for SMEs, (iv) revival and strengthening of the agro-industrial sector, \nand (v) implementation of medium-term industrial and infrastructure projects. The first, second, \nthird,  and  fifth  components  of  the  plan  are  to  be  implemented  by  Samruk-Kazyna,  the \nGovernment's sovereign wealth fund, while the fourth component is implemented by KazAgro \nNational Holding. The NFRK has allocated T1.2 trillion (about $10 billion)18 to support the ACP. \nOf this, $5 billion went to the Republican Budget as targeted transfers, and was subsequently \nused  to  increase  the  Government's  equity  holdings  in  Samruk-Kazyna.  In  addition,  NFRK \npurchased a $4 billion bond issued by Samruk-Kazyna and a $1 billion bond issued by KazAgro \nto form part of the NFRK portfolio. Figure 11 breaks down the resource allocation of the new \nACP.   \n \n                                                 \n18  In 2008, the exchange rate was T120 to $1. \n ", "                                     13\nFigure 11: Allocation of National Fund's Resources for the Anti-crisis Plan \n \n  National Fund of the   \nRepublic of Kazakhstan \n   \n  T607.5 billion   T480 billion    \nCapitalization of Samruk-Kazyna  T120 billion  Bonds of Samruk-Kazyna   \n  Bonds of KazAgro Holding   \n   \n \n  T120 billion  T487.5 billion  AgriculTtu1r3e1 s beciltloior nsupport   T120 billion  T360 billion  \n  Implemen tation of  Financia l sector  SME suppo rt \u2013 lending  Real estat e support   \n  industrial, innovation  stabilization \u2013  through   \nand infrastructure  recapitalization of 4  T48 billion   T83 billion  12 commercial banks   \n  projects  systemic banks  Investment  Lending to \n \nprojects   agricultural \n  enterprises   \n   \n  T24billion  \nT120  billion  T120 billion   T24 billion  T223.5 billion  grain  T120 billion   T240 billion   \n   Halyk Bank        purchase       \n  Kazkommertzbank   Alliance Bank  BTA   Refinancing of  Special program   \nmortgage loans  for completion of \n  real estate   \nconstruction    \n \nT60 billion   T84 billion   T11.5 billion   \n         \n  forD feinpaonscitin g  forD feinpaonsciitn g  T24 b illion  for finDaenpcoinsigt  real   \nreal economy  real economy  Deposit for  economy   \n    ppruefrecrhraedse a onfd    \n  T60 billion  T36 billion  ordinary  T212 billion   \nshares \n    Puorrcdhinaasrey  of  Puorrcdhinaasrey  of  orPduinracrhya sshea orfe s \nshares  shares     \n \n \nSource: Ministry of Finance, Republic of Kazakhstan.   \n \n \nA.  Economic Stimulus and Social Safety Nets \n \n30.  Reviving the Construction Sector and Real Estate Markets. Kazakhstan's anti-crisis \nmeasures seek to ease the liquidity constraints faced in housing construction and real estate \nsectors in different ways. Most of the initiatives do not involve direct transfers to locally-identified \nbeneficiaries, but rather support (through financing of banks) firms' refinancing (pre-termination \nof existing loans and restructuring loan terms) of existing bank loans. In this way, credit risk in \nexisting loan books got reduced, which supports both banks and borrowers. As a result, many \nhousing projects were completed at a cheaper financing cost, through both banks and the Real \nEstate Fund. This aimed to prevent job losses that would have occurred had construction been \ndiscontinued.  \n31.  Also, with the ACP for 2007\u20132008, the Government provided refinancing to developers \nthrough  bank  funds  and  directly  acquired  uncompleted  housing  construction  projects.  This \nresulted in the completion of 22,140 apartments in Astana and Almaty by end-June 2009. The \nexpansion  of  the  mortgage  refinancing  under  the  ACP  for  2009-2010  further  allows  the \ncompletion of construction projects. As of June 2009, a total of 24,566 mortgage borrowers \nhave  benefited  from  the  refinancing  scheme,  and  would  expect  the  completion  of  their \napartments.  \n \n32.  SME  Support.  Anti-crisis  measures  to  help  SMEs  included  the  same  refinancing \nschemes largely in line with those described above for construction and real estate, as a means \nof maintaining their ongoing projects as well as spurring new activity. The 2007\u20132008 crisis \nmeasures have benefited 5,818 SMEs. This supported a total of 8,997 jobs. The ACP for 2009\u2013\n ", "14     \n2010 provided additional financial support, of which 70% is being used for refinancing of existing \nprojects, and the remaining portion for the implementation of new projects. The funds will be \nchanneled through 12 banks and the Damu Fund, set up to spur entrepreneurial development. \nBy 3 July 2009, the banks had entered into contracts for 2,551 SME projects amounting to \nT133.6 billion,19 and have released funds to 2,376 SME projects. The Government reports that \nthe number of active SMEs in the first 5 months of 2009 has increased by 9.5%. \n \n33.  Agro-Industrial  Sector  Support. The Government has identified the agro-industrial \nsector as a key area for stabilizing the economy, as it accounts for 30% of employment. It is \nalso key to ensuring food security. Measures in the 2007\u20132008 package included lending to \nagro-industrial companies and grain procurement for food security. Under the ACP for 2009\u2013\n2010, the Government is to finance agro-industrial projects through KazAgro. The number of \napplications received has reached 156, amounting to T178.8 billion. Of these, 20 projects worth \nT25.4 billion have been approved. \n \n34.  Support for Innovative, Industrial, and Infrastructure Projects. Under the ACP for \n2009\u20132010,  the  Government  will  support  the  implementation  of  innovative,  industrial,  and \ninfrastructure projects to generate employment. It has considered 26 projects in the energy, \ntransport infrastructure, oil and gas, and manufacturing sectors amounting to $19.5 million, for \nwhich $3.5 million in state support is being solicited. \n \n35.  Employment Generation. The employment-generation program was approved in March \n2009 to provide direct fiscal stimulus and address the effects of the crisis on employment. The \nprogram,  involving  eight  ministries  and  coordinated  by  the  Ministry  of  Labor  and  Social \nProtection (MLSP), is targeted to generate employment through seven key interventions. The \nfirst four measures invest in the repair and reconstruction of (i) local urban facilities; (ii) roads; \n(iii) schools,  hospitals,  and  other  social  institutions;  and  (iv)  facilities  in  rural  areas.  The \nremaining three components focus on (i) retraining programs, (ii) creation of social jobs20, and \n(iii) internships. The program aims to create 350,000 jobs. To allow its quick implementation, the \nPublic Procurement Law was revised to allow the program's use of special procedures to reduce \nthe procurement period. In addition to the employment measures, to improve social protection, \nthe period of eligibility for the unemployment allowance was increased from 4 to 6 months. \n \n36.  As of 3 August 2009, significant progress had been made by the employment-generation \nprogram. The investment component, expected to generate 254,232 jobs, created 252,277 jobs \nin 4,773 projects. Of these, 211,039 have been filled. Local governments have provided 77,000 \nadditional new jobs. The retraining program benefited 44,675 people. An additional 51,089 \npeople have been provided with social jobs, 83% of the target of 61,248 people. The internship \ncomponent has achieved 98% of its target of 34,452 people. \n \n37.  Tax Reductions. Additional fiscal stimulus was provided by lowering the tax burden. A \nnew tax code, which lowers corporate income tax and value-added tax rates and grants tax \nbreaks, was made effective starting in January 2009. \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n19 Some banks have contributed their own funds, amounting to about T16 billion, for this initiative. \n20 Social jobs refer to work in social institutions such as hospitals, facilities for elderly people, orphanages and \nschools. \n ", "                                     15\nB.  Financial Sector Stabilization \n \n38.  Capital  and  Deposit  Infusion.  Under  the  ACP,  T488  billion  ($4  billion)  has  been \nallocated  to  stabilize  the  financial  sector  and  improve  confidence  in  the  banking  system. \nSamruk-Kazyna  infused  equity  and  deposits  in  four  major  banks  to  improve  financial \nintermediation. There has been significant progress in providing liquidity support to the banking \nsector. As of end-June 2009, this has brought a capital infusion of T212.7 billion in Bank Turan \nAlem  (BTA),  T60  billion  in  Halyk  Bank,  and  T36  billion  in  Kazkommertzbank.  In  addition, \nGovernment deposits of T60 billion have been channeled into Halyk Bank, T24 billion in Alliance \nBank, and T84 billion in Kazkommertzbank. While the liquidity infusion has relieved financing \nconstraints, there is a need to adopt comprehensive measures to restore confidence in the \nbanking sector. This would include resolving the debts of the distressed banks, which are at \npresent finalizing restructuring agreements with their creditors.  \n \n39.  Exit Strategy. The Government has indicated that it does not intend to remain a long-\nterm investor in private commercial banks. It plans to sell its current ownership of banks' equity \nas soon as the economy starts to recover and banks' access to international capital markets is \nrestored. Banks' private shareholders will be allowed to buy the Government's shares within 5 \nyears. \n \n40.  Mortgage and SME refinancing. As part of the measures to improve the balance sheet \nof banks, Samruk-Kazyna infused deposits to the banks to allow the refinancing of mortgages \nand SME projects. The ACP for 2009\u20132010 expanded support to the real estate sector by \nproviding  mortgage  refinancing.  Samruk-Kazyna  allocated  T240  billion  to  support  the \nconstruction  sector.  Of  this,  (i)  T15  billion  was  used  to capitalize  the  real  estate  fund  for \npurchasing and completing residential and other projects for future leasing; (ii) T17.1 billion has \nbeen transferred to commercial banks to finance the completion of construction projects, of \nwhich  T4.2  billion  has  been  received  by  borrowers;  and  (iii)  T25.3  billion  was  to  provide \nprovisional financing to developers to resume construction projects. Ten banks were allocated \nT120 billion, and by end-June 2009 mortgages amounting to T95.5 billion have been refinanced \nat lower interest rates. \n \n41.  Samruk-Kazyna has channeled T117 billion through 12 banks for either refinancing or \nnew lending to SMEs. As of June 2009, with some banks contributing from own funds for this \ninitiative, banks and SMEs have entered into contracts worth T133.6 billion. T107 billion have \nbeen released to the SMEs. \n \n42.  Liquidity  Adjustment. Several shocks to confidence in the banking sector brought \nliquidity in the financial sector below regulatory minimums. Together with deposit mobilization \nundertaken  through  state-owned  enterprises  to  increase  liquidity  in  banks  and  shore  up \ndepositors' confidence, the authorities reduced reserve requirements in November 2008 in an \neffort to stimulate bank lending. However, total reserves in the banking system have increased, \nreflecting natural liquidity hoarding and no growth in loan demand. \n \n43.  Distressed  Asset  Fund.  The  Distressed  Asset  Fund  was  established  in  2008  to \nimprove the quality of the credit portfolios of the commercial banks through the purchase of bad \nbank assets. However, as of end-June 2009, the fund had yet to be utilized. FMSA, NBK, and \nthe Government are committed to working closely together to determine how to use the fund in \nline with the financial sector component of the ACP.  \n \n \n ", "16     \nC.  Reforms under the ACP  \n \n44.  In addition to the immediate measures to mitigate the impact of the global crisis, the \nACP includes legal and regulatory reforms to improve the business climate. These reforms are \nexpected to reduce the cost of doing business in Kazakhstan, and will not only help sustain \nrecovery but also spur private sector activity during the post-crisis period.  These include: (i) \nsignificant reductions in the number of days, and fees for property and business registration; (ii) \nsignificant  reductions  in  the  number  of  days,  procedural  steps  and  fees  for  construction \nlicensing; (iii) improvement in the disclosure of corporate financial transactions, an area where \nADB  has  provided  recent  technical  assistance;  and  (iv)  reduction  of  documentation \nrequirements, processing time, and cost of export and import transactions. \n \nD.    Government's Monitoring and Reporting System \n \n45.  With significant resources directed for crisis mitigation, the Government has put in place \ncomprehensive implementation arrangements and monitoring systems (Figure 12). There are \ntwo focal ministries responsible for the overall conceptualization and implementation of the ACP \nand  monitoring  the  results.  The  Ministry  of  Economy  and  Budget  Planning  (MEBP)  is \nresponsible for the design and overall monitoring of the ACPs for 2007\u20132008 and 2009\u20132010, \nwhile MLSP has designed the employment-generation program and monitors it. Appendix 7 \npresents further details on the implementation and monitoring arrangements.  \n \n46.  ACPs for 2007\u20132008 and 2009\u20132010. Samruk-Kazyna and KazAgro report to MEBP \nweekly  on  disbursements  by  banks  and  other  conduit  entities  (e.g.,  the  Damu  Fund)  to \nbeneficiaries. FMSA reports weekly on the banking system. These three entities also report \nimplementation progress monthly to the presidential administration. Line ministries report to \nMEBP weekly on the effects of anti-crisis measures on their sectors and on their assigned tasks \nto support these measures. MEBP compiles the reports into a monthly report submitted to the \nprime  minister.  The  prime  minister  reports  on  implementation  progress  to  the  President \nquarterly.  \n \n47.  On the institutional side, the State Commission on Modernization of the Economy,21 \nheaded by the prime minister, was formed in 2007. It meets once a week to monitor the \nimplementation of the ACP, with MEBP acting as its working body. To ensure that financial \nresources drawn from the NFRK to support the ACP are adequately monitored, on 19 January \n2009,  the  President  of  Kazakhstan  established  the  Working  Group  to  Control  the  Use  of \nFinancial Resources of NFRK Allocated for the Anti-crisis Plan for 2009\u20132010. The working \ngroup is headed by the Chairperson of FMSA.22 The working group meets on a monthly basis \nwhere responsible bodies, such as MOF, MEBP, Samruk-Kazyna and KazAgro, report on the \nuse of funds. Minutes of meetings are posted in the FMSA website. Members of the parliament \ncan be invited to participate in the meetings. \n \n48.  Employment-Generation  Program.  MLSP  coordinates  reports  from  the  seven \nministries of (i) transport and communication, (ii) industry and trade, (iii) health, (iv) education \nand science, (v) agriculture, (vi) tourism and sports, and (vii) culture, as well as from local \ngovernments implementing the program.

THE PROPOSED COUNTERCYCLICAL SUPPORT LOAN \n \n49.  Impact,  Outcome,  and  Outputs.  The  intended  impact  of  the  KCSL  is  to  help \nKazakhstan mitigate the impact of the global economic crisis. Its outcome will be greater fiscal \nstimulus.  The  principal  output  will  be  the  full-fledged  implementation  of  the  ACP  and \nemployment-generation program, which will support key sectors of the economy and result in \nadditional jobs. The Government will use proceeds from the KCSL largely to meet ACP and \nemployment-generation program requirements. As the proceeds will flow through the budget, \nthe Government will co-mingle KCSL local currency proceeds with its own resources. \n \n50.  Government's  Financing  Requirements  and  Scope  of  the  KCSL.  Not  including \nNFRK inflows, Kazakhstan's fiscal position has become quite vulnerable in 2009, given the \nseverity of the crisis. As noted earlier (Table 1), the revised 2009 Republican Budget projects a \nrevenue decline of almost 30%, or T623 billion ($4.1 billion), against 2008. The budget revision \nresulted in significant expenditure reallocation among sectors, with low-priority expenditures \nbeing reduced (Table 2). The Government increased expenditures on social security, social \nassistance, housing, and communal facilities by 22%, while cutting the allocation for almost all \nthe other sectors. This also included deferral of the construction of new education and health \nfacilities which were not deemed as immediate. Instead, resources have been directed for either \nsafety nets or \"shovel-ready\" public works projects. As a result of the budgetary realignment, the \noverall deficit, excluding targeted NFRK transfers, is estimated at T922 billion, or $6.1 billion. \nAbout a third of this gap will be met by targeted transfers from NFRK, leaving an unfunded \ndeficit of T574 billion ($3.8 billion), translating to 3.4% of GDP. The critical unmet needs include, \namong other things, social security and social aid (T135 billion or $894 million) and housing and \ncommunal facilities (T42 billion or $278 million).  \n \nTable 2: Financing Requirement and Plan (T billion) \n \n      2009 Budget \n    Item  Original  Revised  % Change \nTotal Revenues  2,860.9  2,489.5  \u201313.0 \nRevenuesa  1,900.7  1,529.5  \u201319.5 \n  Tax  1,827.4  1,455.6  \u201320.3 \n  Nontax  55.3  58.8  6.3 \n  Income from Sale of Fixed Assets  18.0  15.1  \u201316.1 \nWithdrawals/Returns of Transfers  101.6  101.4  \u20130.2 \nRepayment of Budget Loans  14.0  14.0  0.0 \nSales of Financial Assets  1.5  1.5  0.0 \nGuaranteed Transfers from NFRK  843.1  843.1  0.0 \n         \nExpenditures  3,432.2  3,411.0  \u20130.6 \n  Social security, social aid, housing and communal facilities  795.7  972.7  22.2 \n  Others  2,636.5  2,438.3  \u20137.5 \n         \nBudget Balance before NFRK Targeted Transfers  \u2013571.3  \u2013921.5  61.3 \nRepayment of Principal  277.4  249.1  \u201310.2 \n  Internal  269.3  239.1  \u201311.2 \n ", "                                     19\n      2009 Budget \n    Item  Original  Revised  % Change \n  External  8.0  10.0  24.2 \nFinancing Requirement  \u2013848.7  \u20131,170.6  37.9 \n         \nFinancing  848.7  1,170.6   \n  Targeted Transfers from NFRK    347.9   \n  ADB Countercyclical Support Loan    75.5   \n  Other External Borrowing  43.9  40.5  \u20137.7 \n  Domestic Borrowing  804.8  704.8  \u201312.4 \n  Use of Cash Balances    2.0   \n         \nMemorandum Items       \n  Nominal GDP  16,724.1  16,865.2   \n  Budget Balance before NFRK Targeted Transfers/GDP  \u20133.4%  \u20135.5%   \n   Financing Requirement/GDP  \u20135.1%  \u20136.9%   \n( ) = negative, GDP = gross domestic product; NFRK = National Fund of the Republic of Kazakhstan. \na Excludes oil revenues.

The Government has requested a loan of $500 million under the CSF \nfrom ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, with interest to be determined in accordance with ADB's \nLondon interbank-offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility plus 200 basis points; a 5-year \nterm,  including  a  grace  period  of  3  years;  a  commitment  charge  of  75  basis  points  on \nundisbursed  loan  balances;  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  as  are  substantially  in \naccordance with those set forth in the draft Loan Agreement. The Government will use its own \nresources along with those of the KCSL. It will utilize assistance other from ADB and other \ndevelopment partners for project financing.   \n \nVI.  FIDUCIARY DUE DILIGENCE AND IMPLEMENTATION ARRANGEMENTS \nA.  Public Debt Sustainability \n \n52.  Kazakhstan has consistently kept its public debt at low and manageable levels (Table 3). \nBetween 2006 and 2008, public and publicly guaranteed debt was at an average of 6.4% of \nGDP.24 Taking into account the asset portfolio of the country's oil fund, which can be quickly \nmobilized to offset any debt shocks, the net public debt is negative, averaging \u201312.8% of GDP. \nThis clearly indicates that public debt is more than adequately covered and does not pose a risk \nto the economy. Moreover, the foreign exchange risk associated with public debt is quite low, as \n80% of the public debt is domestic. The ratio of public external debt to GDP averaged 1.5% in \n2006\u20132008. For 2009, excluding the KCSL, the ratio of public debt to GDP is expected to \nincrease to 8.6%, and the ratio of public external debt to GDP is projected at 1.5% of GDP.  \n \n \n \n                                                 \n24 Public debt as defined here excludes the debt of NBK and local governments. \n ", "20     \n53.  The  public  debt  sustainability  assessment  shows  that  Kazakhstan's  public  debt \nvulnerability to shocks is quite limited (Appendix 8). It is important that a bound test of shock \nequivalent to 10% of GDP that can arise from banking sector problems does not seriously \ncompromise debt sustainability. Further, ADB staff estimates show that, with a loan amount \nequivalent to 0.45% of GDP, the potential impact of the KCSL on public debt sustainability is \nquite minimal. \nTable 3: Public Debt Indicators (%) \n    Public External   \nYear  Public Debt/GDP  Debt/GDP  Net Public Debt/GDP \n2006  6.7  1.8  \u201310.7 \n2007  5.8  1.4  \u201314.2 \n2008  6.6  1.2  \u201313.6 \n2009  8.6  1.5  \u201316.8 \nNote: Public debt excludes debts by the National Bank of Kazakhstan and the local governments. \nSource: Ministry of Finance; Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nB.  Public Financial Management System \n \n54.  As far as the ACP is concerned, the Government has established sound implementation, \nmonitoring and internal control arrangements (Appendix 7, Figures A7.1 and A7.2). At a broader \nlevel  in  the  public  financial  management  area,  Kazakhstan  has  established  a  transparent \nsystem of budget preparation, execution, and reporting. Monthly budget execution reports are \navailable in the MOF's website. Kazakhstan has adopted a multiyear budgeting framework, with \nits first medium-term budget operational from 2009 to 2011. Internal control systems are in \nplace at two levels. Each line ministry has an internal audit wing. In addition, the Committee for \nFinancial Control, under the Ministry of Finance, monitors and checks budget execution and \ndisbursement. Monthly reports are provided by committee personnel. Scheduled inspections are \nconducted once every 2 years, and unscheduled inspections are conducted as needed. The \ncommittee releases quarterly reports on its activities and provides the President with reports on \nviolations every semester. The committee is plans to implement risk-based inspections in 2010. \nIt also monitors the disbursement of funds from government loans. The committee acts as the \ncentralized procurement agency for ministries and agencies of the central Government. External \naudit is conducted by the accounts committee. \n \n55.  The Public Procurement Law was adopted in 2002 to develop a transparent, competitive, \nand objective public procurement regime. It requires competitive bidding for major procurements \nand provides strict formal requirements to limit the extent of single sourcing. Access to the \nprocurement process is well advertised and open to companies and individuals. Amendments to \nthe law in 2008 limited the powers of government agencies to influence the public procurement \nprocess. This aimed to improve transparency and openness, eliminate major possibilities for \ncorruption  in  public  procurement,  and  introduce  an  electronic  procurement  system,  to  be \nimplemented in 2010. \n \nC.  Anticorruption Framework \n \n56.  Kazakhstan has a well defined legal and institutional framework for combating corruption. \nThe anti-corruption law (Law on Fight Against Corruption) was adopted in 1998. It defines the \ncore principles underlying the anticorruption effort, types of corruption crimes, and responsible \nagencies.  Whistle-blowing  is  supported  and  protected  under  the  law.  The  criminal  code \ncriminalizes  active  and  passive  bribery,  attempted  corruption,  extortion,  money  laundering, \nabuse  of  office,  and  bribe  facilitation  by  third  parties.  The  Law  on  Civil  Service  and  the \n ", "                                     21\nanticorruption law require public officials to report conflicts of interest, though a mechanism for \naddressing such conflicts of interest is required.  \n \n57.  The Agency of the Republic of Kazakhstan on Fighting with Economic and Corruption \nCrimes (i.e., the financial police) is responsible for investigating 44 different types of economic \ncrime,  such  as  active  and  passive  bribery,  abuse  of  authority,  and  smuggling.  In  2006, \nKazakhstan adopted the State Program on Fighting Corruption for 2006\u20132010, and an action \nplan was adopted for its implementation. Among the key components are improving the legal \nframework, strengthening enforcement and judicial systems, promoting public awareness, and \ninvolving civil society in anticorruption activities. \n \n58.  While Kazakhstan's anticorruption legal and institutional framework is relatively broad \nand strong, there certainly is room for improvement. One improvement would be to make the \nlegal  framework  more  preventive  than  curative.  There  is  also  scope  for  improving  the \nenforcement and implementation of the framework. \n \n59.  In terms of international anticorruption cooperation, Kazakhstan joined the ADB/OECD \nAnticorruption  Initiative  for  Asia-Pacific  in  May  2002.  It  acceded  to  the  United  Nations \nConvention Against Corruption in June 2008. \n \nD.  Countercyclical Support Facility Management and ADB Monitoring \n \n60.  The Ministry of Finance (MOF) will be the Executing Agency for the KCSL, which will \nadopt existing mechanisms designed by the Government for implementing crisis mitigation. The \nmain implementing agencies will be MEBP, MOF and MLSP. MEBP will coordinate and monitor \nthe  implementation  of  the  ACP,  while  MLSP  coordinates  and  monitors  the  employment-\ngeneration  program.  MOF  will  monitor  the  budget  execution  and  fiduciary  control  of \nexpenditures for the crisis mitigation measures, including those supported by the KCSL.  \n \n61.  Within 1 month of program effectiveness, MOF, the implementing agencies, and ADB \nwill  establish  a  performance  evaluation  system  based  on  the  program  framework.  ADB's \nmonitoring  mechanism  for  the  utilization  of  KCSL  will  be  built  around  the  Government's \nmonitoring  and  reporting  system  (Appendix  7).  Section  IV.D  present  the  monitoring \narrangements established by the Government for the effective implementation of the crisis \nmitigation  measures.  ADB  monitoring  of  the  KCSL  will  be  done  at  three  levels \n(i) macroeconomic and financial sector performance, (ii) implementation of anti-crisis measures, \n(iii) budget execution. Reporting arrangements have been agreed with MEBP, MLSP and MOF, \nand will be done on a quarterly basis.  \n \n62.  ADB will monitor and assess macroeconomic and financial sector performance during \nthe program period. MEBP and MOF shall coordinate with FMSA, NBK and other ministries, and \nshall provide ADB reports on macroeconomic and financial sector developments. MLSP shall \nprovide ADB reports on the employment, social and poverty situation. ADB will monitor and \nreview the implementation and accomplishments of the anti-crisis measures, most especially on \nthe aspects of spurring economic activity and creating jobs. ADB's monitoring will focus on the \nanti-crisis measures that are financed from the budget. MEBP and MLSP shall provide ADB the \nimplementation  reports  on  each  component  of  the  ACP  and  the  employment-generation \nprogram. MOF shall provide ADB budget execution reports on expenditures incurred by the \nGovernment  for  anti-crisis  measures  supported  by  the  budget.  MOF  will  ensure  that  the \nCommittee of Financial Control checks the expenditures made from Republican Budget to \nsupport the anti-crisis measures. Likewise, such reports will be shared with ADB. In addition, \n ", "22     \nADB will monitor the minutes of the meetings of the Working Group to Control the Use of \nFinancial  Resources  of  NFRK  Allocated  for  the  Anti-crisis  Plan  for  2009-2010.  Likewise, \ndialogues with the Interagency Committee on Employment and Staff Retraining Issue will be \nconducted. \n \n63.  ADB will coordinate with all relevant development partners to monitor and evaluate \nprogram  performance.  Likewise,  ADB  will  regularly  hold  discussions  with  the  International \nMonetary Fund, World Bank and other development partners to gather information on the \nmacroeconomic  and  fiscal  situation  in  Kazakhstan.  Appendix  9  presents  information  on \ndevelopment partner support to the country in areas relevant to KCSL. \n \n64.  MOF,  MEBP  and  ADB  will  jointly  conduct  reviews,  on  a  quarterly  basis,  of  the \nmacroeconomic, financial sector and fiscal conditions, and assess the impact and evaluate the \nbenefits from activities under the anti-crisis measures on the real economy and social sectors. \nThe Government will work with ADB, including consultants engaged by ADB under its regional \ntechnical  assistance25,  on  the  monitoring  of  the  anti-crisis  measures  funded  by  budgetary \nexpenditures. ADB missions will also conduct dialogues with the State Commission on the \nModernization  of  the  Economy  and  the  Working  Group  to  Control  the  Use  of  Financial \nResources of NFRK Allocated for the Anti-crisis Plan for 2009\u20132010 to assess the progress of \nand use of financial resources for the ACP. \n \nE.  Procurement and Disbursement  \n \n65.  Loan proceeds will be used to pay for items procured in ADB member countries and not \nspecified in the list of ineligible items (Appendix 10) or imports financed by other bilateral and \nmultilateral sources. The proceeds of the program loan will be disbursed in accordance with \nADB\u2019s  simplified  disbursement  procedures  for  program  loans.26 Loan  proceeds  disbursed \nagainst imports will require a certificate from the Government stipulating that the value of the \ntotal imports to Kazakhstan, minus its imports from nonmember countries, ineligible imports, \nand imports financed under other official development assistance, is equal to or greater than the \namount of the loan expected to be disbursed during a particular year. ADB reserves the right to \naudit the use of loan proceeds to verify the accuracy of the Government\u2019s certification. \n \nF.  Implementation Period \n \n66.  The proceeds of the loan will be released in a single tranche upon effectiveness. The \nproceeds are expected to be utilized by June 2010. The loan closing date is 31 December 2010 \nto allow time to audit the implementation of the program. \n \nG.  Anticorruption and Fiduciary Issues \n \n67.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the Government. Consistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability, and \ntransparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged \ncorrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the KCSL. To support these \nefforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the loan regulations \nand  the  bidding  documents  for  the  KCSL.  In  particular,  all  contracts  financed  by  ADB  in \n                                                 \n25 This regional technical assistance is being processed, and among activities is the monitoring and fiduciary control \nof crisis response expenditures in selected Central Asian and Caucasus countries.  \n26 ADB. 1998. Simplification of Disbursement Procedures and Related Requirements for Program Loans. Manila. \n ", "                                     23\nconnection with the KCSL shall include provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and \nexamine the records and accounts of the Executing Agency and all contractors, suppliers, \nconsultants, and other service providers as they relate to the KCSL. \n \nH.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n \n68.  ADB retains the right to audit the use of loan proceeds and to verify the accuracy of the \nGovernment\u2019s certification for withdrawal applications. Before withdrawal, the Government will \nopen a deposit account at NBK to receive all loan proceeds. The account will be managed, \noperated, and liquidated in accordance with terms satisfactory to ADB.  \n \nVII.  BENEFITS, RISKS, AND ASSUMPTIONS \n69.  Benefits. Kazakhstan has taken wide-ranging measures to mitigate the adverse impacts \nof global financial turmoil. It has allocated significant budgetary and NFRK resources. The \nproposed KCSL will benefit Kazakhstan by reinforcing the ACP and augmenting the fiscal \nstimulus that the country has mobilized using its own sources. It will help Kazakhstan reduce \nover-reliance on NFRK for short-term purposes and diversify its funding sources. The provision \nof  the  KCSL,  which  recognizes  the  anti-crisis  measures  as  effective,  will  also  help  raise \nKazakhstan's profile as it approaches international capital markets once normalcy returns. By \nbeing an integral part of the ACP, loan proceeds will help in job creation by reviving the \nconstruction sector, SMEs and agro-industries, as well as through the dedicated public works \nprograms. The proposed loan will also indirectly help restore banking system stability. \n \n70.  Kazakhstan has withstood crisis shocks thus far quite effectively. The significant pool of \noil resources and prudent fiscal management of recent years have helped. While the economy \nis forecast to recover in 2010 with favorable medium-term growth prospects, there are several \nrisks that Kazakhstan faces, including the following: \n  \n(i)  Slow  regional  and  global  recovery  and  uncertain  commodity  prices. \nKazakhstan's economy depends heavily on developments in the West, as well as \nwithin its neighbors, particularly the Russian Federation. Its metallurgical sector \nhas been adversely affected by slowing demand in the region for iron ore and \nother metals. Kazakhstan's pace of recovery is also predicated on oil prices and \nhow long they will stay above $65\u2013$70 per barrel.  \n(ii)  Economic slowdown-induced banking distress. The banking sector has been \nslow  to  recover,  with  nonperforming  loans  continuing  to  increase.  Tardy \neconomic recovery will slow progress in bringing the banking sector back to a \nsound footing, which will continue to be affected by inadequate funding sources. \nNBK  and  FMSA  have  tightened  their  policy  and  oversight,  but  sector \nrestructuring needs to be closely monitored.  \n(iii)  Banking  distress-induced  disruption  to  economic  activity. In the current \ncircumstances of heightened risk aversion and liquidity problems, the financial \nsector can recover only slowly, limiting its ability to assist aggregate demand \nrecovery and expansion. In the meantime, any further deterioration of solvency \nindicators and depositors' confidence would add a new dimension of disruption to \neconomic  activity.  This  risk  has  been  recognized  and  acted  upon  by  the \nauthorities with swift confidence-building measures. \n \n ", "24     \n(iv)  Inability to mobilize domestic resources. Clearly, Kazakhstan cannot rely on \nexternal  borrowing  at  levels  close  to  100%  of  GDP,  as  it  does  now.  It  is \nimperative  that  the  country  come  up  with  sustainable  domestic  financial \nintermediation alternatives. This is a tall order but one that needs to be filled. \n \n(v)  Governance  concerns.  Mobilizing  capital  on  a  sustained  basis  will  require \ngreater transparency and a better investment climate. There are concerns that \ninvestors' rights may not always be protected in the country. In times like these \nwhen global markets price marginal risks with great variance, Kazakhstan needs \nto  attract  greater  investments,  including  investment  outside  the  oil  sector. \nRecognizing the problems, the Government has taken a few important measures. \nIt has adopted a comprehensive anticorruption program. It has also expressed its \ncommitment to the Extractive Industry Transparency Initiative. The medium-term \nreforms under the ACP (para.44) are expected to help in attracting investments. \n \nVIII.  RECOMMENDATION \n71.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  of \n$500,000,000 to the Republic of Kazakhstan for the Kazakhstan Countercyclical Support Loan \nfrom ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, with interest to be determined in accordance with ADB's \nLondon interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility plus 200 basis points; a term of 5 \nyears,  including  a  grace  period  of  3  years;  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  as  are \nsubstantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft Loan Agreement presented to the \nBoard.  \n \n \n \n \nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n \n1 September 2009 \n \n \n ", "                                 Appendix 1   25\nIa1Sri Lanka \nKAZAKHSTAN: ASSESSMENT OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE COUNTERCYCLICAL \nSUPPORT ACCESS CRITERIA \n \nA.   Summary Assessment \n \nCountercyclical Support  Asian Development Bank (ADB) Staff Assessment \nFacility Criteria and Indicators \n1. Adverse Impact of the  Kazakhstan is the first country in the Central and West Asian region to be directly \nGlobal Economic Crisis  affected  by  the  global  economic  crisis.  After  a  decade  of  rapid  expansion, \neconomic growth plummeted in 2008 and the economy is set to contract in 2009. \nThe trade and financial sectors are among the worst affected, with the adverse \nimpact of the crisis percolating down across the entire economy, eroding the \ngains from high growth in recent years. There have been foreign exchange \nreserve losses and a 20% devaluation of the currency. Although Kazakhstan has \na relatively high gross domestic product (GDP) per capita, the crisis and currency \ndevaluation have lowered per capita income by 15% to $7,000 over the past year. \nSecond,  Kazakhstan\u2019s  access  to  capital  has  been  severely  constrained.  To \nrestore growth, the Government of Kazakhstan (the Government) has put in place \na $22 billion crisis mitigation package, of which $10 billion will come from the \nNational Fund of the Republic of Kazakhstan (NFRK), its oil fund. The provision \nfrom the CSF would send positive signals to the market and help revive investor \nconfidence. \nEconomic Growth and Overall  Real GDP grew at 9.8% on average during 2005\u20132007. Projections in early 2008 \nMacroeconomic Impact  by the Government and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) indicated that the \neconomy might grow by about 5% during the year, while the actual growth rate \nwas 3.3%. The Government has projected a 1% growth rate for 2009, while the \nIMF predicts a contraction of 2%. Real GDP declined by 2.3% in the first 6 months \nof the year, year-on-year. Industrial output declined by 2.7% over the same \nperiod. The construction sector activity drastically decelerated, with expansion \ntumbling from over 16% in 2007 to less than 2% in 2008. In the first 6 months of \n2009, construction contracted 8.3%.  \nImpact on Trade  Exports have been adversely affected, declining by over 50% to $14 billion during \nJanuary\u2013May  2009  over  the  same  period  in  2008.  The  slump  was  caused \nprimarily by weakening oil prices. Imports declined by 21% to $10.8 billion. \nExports are projected to decline by 37% for the whole year, driving the current \naccount into a larger deficit than envisaged earlier.  \nImpact on the financial sector  Since the start of the global turmoil in mid-2007, international capital markets \nhave pulled back sharply on their lending to Kazakh commercial banks, which \nhave virtually halted lending. The share of nonperforming loans grew from 5% in \nmid-2008 to 9% in January 2009 and to 11% in June 2009. The Government was \nforced to take control of the largest and fourth-largest banks, and it injected \ncapital into the second- and third-ranked banks. The National Bank of Kazakhstan \n(NBK) and the Financial Monitoring Supervisory Agency have worked together to \nstrengthen the prompt corrective action framework. \nFiscal Deficit  If NFRK resources are included, Kazakhstan's fiscal position is generally quite \nstrong, as the fund supports budgetary requirements. However, the Government's \ncalculations do not include fund resources, as the latter are targeted largely at \ncapital expenditures and maintaining equity in the distribution of resources across \nthe regions of the country. The Government's figures indicate a fiscal deficit of \n1.7% of GDP in 2007 and of 2.1% in 2008. For 2009, lower receipts prompted a \nforecast that the deficit would be larger, at 3.4% of GDP. Expectations of slower \ngrowth in oil revenue, as well as planned increases in social spending, prompted \nthe Government to project a fiscal deficits of 3.5% in 2010 and 2.4% in 2011. \nAccess to Capital  The market risk perceptions of Kazakh assets turned sharply negative with the \nonset of the global economic crisis in mid-2007. Credit default swap spreads rose \nfrom around 120 basis points in June 2007 to 260 basis points in June 2008 and \nabout 300 basis points in March 2009. Bond spreads widened significantly for \nsome of the systemically important banks, including Kazkommertzbank and Bank \nTuran Alem, with spreads ranging from 350\u2013900 basis points in June 2008 to \n ", "26    Appendix 1 \nCountercyclical Support  Asian Development Bank (ADB) Staff Assessment \nFacility Criteria and Indicators \n1,700\u20132,700 basis points in March 2009. Alliance Bank bore the brunt of the \nrepricing, with spreads rising from about 1,100 basis points in early 2008 to over \n7,700 basis points in March 2009. It is quite unlikely that the country or any of its \nsub-sovereign entities will access the market in the near future. \n \n2. Planned Countercyclical  The first crisis mitigation measures were implemented in late 2007. In November \nDevelopment Expenditures  2008, the Government announced a new $10 billion anti-crisis package which \nfor Poverty Reduction  aims for macroeconomic and financial sector stabilization in general. Its focus is \nto (i) recapitalize the banking sector, (ii) revive the construction sector, (iii) support \nsmall  and  medium-sized  enterprises  by  financing  new  investments  and \nrefinancing current ones, (iv) develop the agro-industrial sector, (v) ensure that \nplanned infrastructure projects continue, and (vi) ensure that vulnerable groups \nfind employment opportunities. Additional fiscal stimulus was announced in March \n2009 through an employment-generation program amounting to $1.3 billion. \nInfrastructure spending  While the bulk of the stimulus package has gone to strengthening the banking \nsector, upwards of 30% of the stimulus is devoted to infrastructure, focusing on \nhighways  and  power. The  Government  has  adopted  a  medium-term  export-\npromotion strategy. \nSocial safety net schemes  The Government has increased budgetary allocation by 10% year-on-year for \nminimal  social  assistance  for  vulnerable  families.  Job  losses  have  been \nincreasing. Underemployment has become more prevalent, with employees in \nlarge  manufacturing  establishments  being  put  on  part-time  schedules.  The \nGovernment has set up retraining programs for workers who may need to acquire \nnew skills. Yet the stimulus package focuses predominantly on the financial and \ninfrastructure sectors, which will indirectly benefit employment. \n3. Sound Macroeconomic  Kazakhstan's  macroeconomic  management  of  fiscal,  monetary,  and  external \nManagement  concerns has been prudent over the past decade. Supported by rising commodity \nprices, the Government has been in a relatively strong position. It has put in place \na fiscal responsibility framework, which sets limits on deficits and public sector \nborrowing. Coordination between fiscal and monetary authorities has significantly \nimproved over the past 8\u201310 years.  \nMonetary policy and inflation  While the consumer price index increased in 2007 dramatically to 19%, inflation \nhas  been  brought  under  control.  NBK's  monetary  policy  is  assessed  to  be \nappropriate. NBK has begun to adopt an expansionary but cautious stance to \nsupport fiscal stimulus. \nPublic financial management  Over the past 8 years, Kazakhstan has invested significantly in strengthening its \npublic financial management. Budget preparation, execution, and reporting are \ntransparent.  The  intergovernmental  fiscal  framework  is  well  formulated.  The \nGovernment's internal control systems are considered to be sufficient.  \nDebt management  Kazakhstan's debt position is generally comfortable. Its outstanding public debt of \n$9.7 billion as of 1 July 2009 equals 9% of GDP. Public external debt equaled \nless than 1.5% of GDP. If NFRK assets are included, Kazakhstan's total public \ndebt on a net basis is \u201316.8% of GDP. Accordingly, Kazakhstan does not face \nany debt distress from the public sector point of view. However, Kazakhstan's \noverall external debt levels have been high, estimated at around 99% of GDP, \ndue largely to the increasing exposure of the banking sector. NFRK provides \nsufficient cushion to the authorities to mitigate risks, such as seen recently \nthrough the repricing of Kazakh debt in international markets. \nInternational reserves  NBK spent over $6 billion from international currency reserves in late 2008 to \ndefend the Kazakh tenge. Official reserves, which had peaked at $22 billion in \nSeptember 2008, declined to $18.3 billion in January 2009 and then gradual \nrebounded to just under $20 billion as of June 2009. Reserves are adequate to \ncover 7 months of imports and to meet short-term debt-servicing obligations. \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "                                 Appendix 1   27\nB.

The ongoing shock to private domestic expenditure is rooted in the (i) lag effect of the \nsudden stop in banks' access to international capital markets in the third quarter of 2007 and \ngrowing weaknesses in banks' loan portfolios that have developed since then, (ii) low growth in \nreal income, and (iii) recently heightened caution among domestic consumers and investors. \n \n2.  External Balance and Exchange-Rate Shocks. The sudden stop in capital inflows that \noccurred in the second half of 2007 would have altered, under different circumstances, the \nexchange-rate conditions under which external macroeconomic balance could be established. \nFollowing years of continued appreciating pressure to bring the tenge to around T120 per US \ndollar, the exchange-rate peg at the end of 2007 was maintained only with losses of $5 billion in \nforeign exchange reserves. As NBK increased its purchases of tenge to stave off speculative \npressures and use of monetary instruments to slow capital outflows, it continued to subordinate \nthe growth of monetary aggregates in 2007 and 2008 to the defense of the exchange-rate peg \n(Figures A1.3\u2013A1.4).  \n \n                                                 \n1  This section needs to be read in conjunction with Section III of the RRP.  \n ", "28    Appendix 1 \nFigure A1.3: Trends in Foreign Exchange Reserves  Figure A1.4: Money Supply and FX Reserves \n6,000 155 5,000,000 2.3\n4,500,000 2.1\n150\n4,000\n4,000,000\n1.9\n145\n3,500,000\n1.7\n2,000\n140 3,000,000\n1.5\n2,500,000\n0 135\n1.3\n06 06 06 06 07 07 07 07 08 08 08 08 09 09 2,000,000\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n2,000 Q1 2 Q2 2 Q3 2 Q4 2 Q1 2 Q2 2 Q3 2 Q4 2 Q1 2 Q2 2 Q3 2 Q4 2 Q1 2 Q2 2 130 1,500,000 1.1\n0.9\n125 1,000,000\n4,000 500,000 0.7\n120\n0 0.5\n6 6 6 6 7 7 7 7 8 8 8 8 9 9\n6,000 115 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n1  2  3  4  1  2  3  4  1  2  3  4  1  2 \nQuarterly Change in Official Foreign Change Reserves ($ Million; LHS axis) Q Q Q Q Q Q Q Q Q Q Q Q Q Q\nEnd of Period Exchange Rate (T per $, RHS axis)\n  M1 M2 M2/FX Reserves M1/FX Reserves\n \nLHS = left hand side, RHS = right hand side              FX = foreign exchange \nSource: International Financial Statistics.

However, the negative shock to demand for tenge was compensated \nfor by the increase in demand for tenge brought about by strong export turnover and high \ninternational commodity prices. The monetary policy of NBK brought a contraction in real terms \nin monetary aggregates from July 2007 to end-2008 (Figures A1.5-A1.6). Although the anti-\ninflationary credibility of NBK has gained from this policy consistency, and annual growth in \nconsumer  prices  was  brought  down  to  single  digits  (which  now  allows  for  historically  low \nrefinancing rates), the effects from this monetary contraction in real terms in 2008 cannot be \ndissociated from the slowdown in economic activity.  \n \nFigure A1.5: Monetary Aggregates  Figure A1.6: Banking System Liabilities \n0.54 35,000 900,000\n31,946.37 31,758.45\n800,000\n0.52 30,000\n700,000\n0.50 25,000 600,000\n500,000\n0.48 20,000\n400,000\n0.46 15,000 300,000\n200,000\n0.44 10,000\n100,000\n0.42 5,000 0\n7 7 7 7 8 8 8 8 9 9\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0.40 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n006 006 006 006 007 007 007 007 008 008 008 008 009 009 Q1  Q2  Q3  Q4  Q1  Q2  Q3  Q4  Q1  Q2 \n2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n1  2  3  4  1  2  3  4  1  2  3  4  1  2 \nQ Q Q Q Q Q Q Q Q Q Q Q Q Q Liabilities to Other Depository Corporations (Banks Reserves)\nM2/P M1/M2 Liabilities to Other Sectors (Other Deposits with Central Bank)\n   \nSource: International Financial Statistics. \n \n ", "                                 Appendix 1   29\n4.  In the second-half of 2008, once international commodity prices and external demand for \nKazakhstan's main exports fell abruptly, and the Russian ruble started to slide against the \nKazakh tenge, speculative pressures against the tenge exchange-rate peg resumed. Intense \ncapital flight and increasing dollarization were immediate phenomena at the end of 2008, and \nbetween  October  2008  and  February  2009  NBK  spent  close  to  $3  billion  defending  the \nexchange-rate  peg.

Financial Sector in Kazakhstan \n \n72.  The financial system in Kazakhstan is dominated by the banking sector. While insurance, \npension, stock, and bond markets have been adversely affected by the global credit contraction, \nthey have remained relatively stable (Table A4.1).  \n \nTable A4.1: Banking Portion of Financial Markets \n(as of 1 June 2009) \n(T billion)  \n    Pension     \n  Banking sector  accumulation  Insurance sector  Mortgage \nIndicator   funds  companies \nTotal assets   12,137.5   73.1   298.0   95.5 \nTotal liabilities   12,364.5   6.7   130.1   72.9 \nOwn capital   227.0   66.4   167.9   22.6 \nSource: Financial Institutions' Association of Kazakhstan. \n \nB.  Banks, Borrowers, and Global Credit \n \n73.  In 2005, banks increasingly turned to the global financial markets to underwrite the \ngrowth in credit. About half of bank credit expansion in Kazakhstan was funded from abroad. \nThese sources proved to be exceptionally easy to access over the years, as international \ninvestors reached for yields in ever-longer maturities, incentivized by a relatively flat yield curve \nand historically low interest rates.1 Since Kazkommertzbank issued its first eurobond in 1998, all \nleading  Kazakh  banks gained  access  to  international capital  markets  and,  in  the  process, \nbecame increasingly dependent on them. These global sources are quick to close off funds, \nespecially in developing markets, as the Kazakh banks learned in mid-2007. The motivation for \naccessing foreign capital came from two sources. First, the banks could rapidly increase their \nability to fund loans and other assets without relying on domestic deposits, which were more \nexpensive (or so it appeared) and take longer to develop. Second, many borrowers were \nmotivated to borrow in foreign currency (primarily the US dollar) because the interest rate was \nlower than the tenge equivalent and the risk of a significant appreciation in the value of the US \ndollar was seen as low (Table A4.2). \n \nTable A4.2: Bank Loan Interest Rates in FC and T \nItem   1999  2000  2001  2002  2003  2004  2005  2006  2007  2008* \nWeighted average interest rates, % \nForeign currency  22.8  21.1  20.1  18.1  17.2  14.9  14.3  13.9  12.5    10.0 \nTenge  26.0  27.2  25.5  24.3  21.8  20.6  19.7  18.0  14.7  13.5 \nSource: Financial Monitoring Supervisory Agency, National Bank of Kazakhstan. \n \n74.  The abundance of cheap international credit to Kazakhstan resulted in a very high \ngrowth of credit in the domestic market along with increased foreign exchange exposure \nof the banks.

This external financing boom also supported the local currency. As \nlong as the economy grew faster than those of the eurozone and the US, foreign investment \nflowed  in,  economic  activity  surged,  and  the  tenge  was  stable  or  seen  as  potentially \nstrengthening, allowing foreign-denominated loans to be serviced. However, the collapse of US \nbanking giants in September 2008 precipitated a global financial panic that exposed deep-\nseated  problems  in  Kazakhstan.  Such  panics  almost  inevitably  spur  investors  to  pull  their \ninvestments from foreign locales, which usually means emerging markets like Kazakhstan, and \nin 2008 the panic was particularly destructive. \n \nC.  Initial Wave Affecting Kazakhstan \n \n75.  The first shock wave of global credit contraction in August 2007 had an immediate \neffect on Kazakh banks' financial structure and their ability to provide financing to the \ndomestic  economy. In August 2007, Kazakh banks' access to global credit markets was \ncurtailed in sync with the US markets. The banks responded with restrictions on domestic credit. \nThis chain reaction triggered a decline in real estate prices and created debt-service problems \nfor many borrowers from September 2007 onward. \n \nFigure A4.1: Residential Property Prices (new and \nexisting) 2001-2009\nScale: December 2000 = 100\n2000\n1500\nNew\n1000\nExisting\n500\n0\n2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009\nSource: Asian Development Outlook, 2009.\n \n \n76.  Real  estate  loans  are  particularly  hard  hit.  As  residential  mortgage  loans  have \ndeteriorated in performance (nonperforming loans rose from 1.2% to 4.1% during 2008 and \ncontinue  to  deteriorate),  the  proportion  of  residential  mortgage  loans  in  bank  portfolios \nincreased to 8.5% in January 2009 from 6.7% in October 2008. The increase was not a function \nof a reduction in portfolio but an absolute increase in these loans from T605 billion to T784 \nbillion (Table A4.2). \n \n77.  The predominance of residential and commercial real estate loans underscores their \nimportance to bank balance sheets. The consequences of default on these loans spread into \nthe economy and have multiple effects by reducing employment in construction and related \nfields. Yet, the range of potential harm goes even beyond that, as defaults on commercial loans \nthat support multifamily housing can lead to deterioration in building maintenance and ultimately \nto the displacement of tenants. \n \n \n ", "                           Appendix 4  39\nFigure A4.2: Residential Mortgage Loans\n8.5\n1000 10.0\n7.1 7.0 6.8 6.7\n800 8.0\non 600 6.0\nbilli 400 4.0 %\nT \n200 2.0\n630 622 612 605 784\n0 0.0\n01.01.2008 01.04.2008 01.07.2008 01.10.2008 01.01.2009\nResidential mortgage loans\nResidential mortgage loans as percentage of loan portfolio, %\nSource: Financial Monitoring Supervisory Agency.\n \n \nD.  The Present Situation \n \n78.  Recent problems have affected the sector.  At the beginning of 2009, three large \nKazakh financial institutions\u2014Bank Turan Alem (BTA), Alliance Bank, and Astana Finance\u2014\ndefaulted and announced plans to restructure their foreign debt. The default of BTA Bank, the \nlargest financial institution in the country, with a total asset market share of about 25%, raised \nconcerns about banking system stability. \n \n79.  The banking sector in Kazakhstan has entered a new phase in recent weeks, \ncontracting substantially in reaction to the cumulative effects of reduced access to credit \nand the diminution of asset values.2 As borrower ability to service debt continues to decline in \na weakened economy, bank assets are increasingly reset by larger loss provisions that reflect \nloan repayment and collateral values in a declining real estate market. Provisions for loan loss \nhave increased to over 15% from the low single digits less than a year ago. In June, two of the \nlargest banks took provisions in excess of 57%, resulting in an average provision of 29% for the \nsector, effectively wiping out equity in the sector. The current status of equity capital stands at \nnegative $1.5 billion for the sector, not taking into account potential reductions in liabilities and \nequity conversions pursuant to loan negotiations with global creditors. The authorities have \ntaken control (both in ownership and management) of the three banks in default on foreign \nloans and effectively \"ring-fenced\" them from the sector (Figure A4.4). \n \nE.  Balance Sheets and Income Statements \n \n80.  Asset values continue to decline. Exacerbating the asset quality pressures are the \nhigher cost of borrowing and the drop in residential real estate prices, which are down by more \nthan 30% on average (and by 60% in some segments) since their peak in mid-2007 on lower \nsales  volumes.  Bank  lending  to  the  worst-affected  sectors\u2014construction  and  real  estate\u2014\nrepresented 19% of total loans at the end of May 2008. Residential mortgages represented an \nadditional 9%. Banks are further exposed to the drop in property prices, as more than 50% of \ntheir loans are collateralized with real estate. Complicating matters, the asset quality indicators \nthat  Kazakh  banks  submit  may  misreport  actual  performance,  mainly  because  of  massive \nrestructuring and rollover. Most loans are unseasoned and were extended during the upswing, \nand two thirds of loans have maturities greater than 5 years. \n                                                 \n2  In April 2008, Halyk Bank placed a benchmark eurobond of $500 million, the only commercial bank placement \nsince August 2007.

In the year to date, the \nsector has lost over $13.5 billion, mostly in the past 90 days, through provisions against losses \non the balance sheets of the banks in restructuring mode. Excluding the three troubled banks, \nincome is flat to slightly negative for 2009. Equity capital for the remaining 34 banks stands at \nover $6.5 billion, yet further erosion of income and capital is expected.  \n         \n82.  Excluding BTA and Alliance Bank, which have reported multibillion-dollar losses from \nasset write-downs in 2008 under International Financial Reporting Standards, the return on \naverage assets for rated Kazakh banks dropped to 0.38% in 2008 from 2.46% in 2007. The \naverage net interest margin decreased only marginally to 5.88% in 2008, thanks to increased \nlending rates and a steeper yield curve, yet overall net profit declined as a result of loan loss \ncharges from deteriorating balance sheets. \n \n83.  A significant portion of Kazakh banks\u2019 revenue comes from corporate lending, which has \nprompted rating agencies to forecast significant volatility in revenues.3 Fee and commission \nincome (a more stable source of income) remains relatively modest, making up less than 20% \nof banks\u2019 operating income. \n \n84.  It is likely that a significant portion of banks\u2019 current revenue comes from items \nthat are not sustainable, e.g., interest income accrued on nonperforming assets, the purchase \nof a bank's own debt at a discount, and avoiding recognition of loss by refinancing troubled \nloans. \n \n85.  Foreign exchange matching has improved on paper. Although foreign debt declined \nto 35% of banks\u2019 total funding by the end of April 2009 down from 45% a year previously, it still \nremains a source of systemic risk. Moreover, for a few individual banks, foreign borrowings \nmake up around half of their total liabilities. Further, many of the offsetting assets are loans to \nborrowers with little capacity to earn foreign currency income to service the debt, thereby \npotentially overstating the degree to which foreign currency liabilities match foreign currency \nassets (Figure A4.3). \n \nFigure A4.3: Dynamics of Banking Sector Liabilities\n8,005\n7,753\n12,000 7,502 8,000\n7,362 7,286\n10,000 5,916 6,000 6,379 6,236 6,428 5,239 5,003 4,945 4,913 7,000\n5,472 6,000\n8,000 4,986 4,977 4,690 4,610\n5,478 5,391 5,464 5,000\nn n\nbillio 6,000 4,130 4,637 4,000 billio\nT  T \n3,000\n4,000 7,475 7,377 7,419 7,613\n6,522\n5,747 5,869 2,000\n4,515 4,738 4,796\n2,000 3,872 3,984\n1,000\n0 0\n1.01.20071.04.20071.07.20071.10.20071.01.20081.01.20091.02.20091.03.20091.04.20091.05.20091.06.20091.07.2009*\nLiabilities to residents Liabilities to non-residents Liabilities in forex (right scale)\nSource: Financial Monitoring Supervisory Agency.\n \n                                                 \n3 Moody's estimated in August 2009 that 70% of revenue is from corporate lending.  \n ", "                           Appendix 4  41\n86.

Asian Development Bank (ADB) exposure to the Kazakhstan banking sector was $147 \nmillion as of 1 August 2009, consisting of senior unsecured loans to Bank Turan Alem (BTA) \nworth $54 million, Alliance Bank worth $33 million, and Bank CenterCredit worth $28 million and \na guarantee for the securitization of foreign remittances for Alliance Bank worth $32 million. \nADB also provided deferred payments rights guarantees to Kazkommertzbank for $100 million, \nwhich was later successfully repaid.  \n   \n2.  In  April  2009  two  banks,  BTA  and  Alliance  Bank,  declared  moratoria  on  principal \npayments during restructuring. In June 2009, BTA extended a moratorium on interest payments \nas  well.  Alliance  Bank  continues  to  pay  interest,  though  its  liquidity  situation  is  extremely \nstrained.  Negotiations  with  creditors  on  restructuring  continue,  with  Alliance  Bank  making \nconsiderable progress and BTA is still in the early stages of negotiating with creditors.   \n \n3.  BTA.  BTA  is  the  largest  of  the  four  systemically  important  banks  that  received \nGovernment support. In February 2009, Samruk-Kazyna, the national wealth fund, acquired a \nshare of 76% in BTA and replaced the bank's management. A subsequent analysis of BTA's \nassets and liabilities showed a large degree of related-party lending and engagement in foreign \n(mostly Russian and Ukrainian) real estate transactions that impaired its loan portfolio to a point \nthat exceeded market expectations. BTA has appointed Union Bank of Switzerland and Lazard \nFreres as advisors to achieve a restructuring agreement with lenders. The financial regulator, \nthe Financial Monitoring Supervisory Agency (FMSA), has granted the bank until September \n2009  to  propose  a  restructuring  plan  that  enjoys  lender  support.  It  is  expected  that  final \nagreements with lenders can be achieved before yearend.  \n \n4.  Alliance Bank. Alliance Bank is the fourth-largest bank in Kazakhstan. In the past few \nyears, it has transformed itself from a regional bank to a national player through rapid loan \ngrowth, which it funded largely with external dollar-denominated financing. It has had particular \nsuccess in the retail market, where it has been an innovator in unsecured consumer lending. \nThe economic downturn has significantly affected Alliance Bank. Asset quality has quickly \ndeteriorated. In January 2009, shareholders proposed that Samruk-Kazyna purchase a 78% \nstake for the symbolic price of T100. Samruk-Kazyna first agreed but then put this on hold when \nit was discovered that $1.1 billion of the bank's assets had been wiped out by fraud. However, \nafter the memorandum on restructuring with creditors was signed in early July, wherein Alliance \nBank and lenders agreed on a schedule to finalize restructuring that will eliminate and estimated \n75% of Alliance Bank's debt of $4 billion and bringing the bank's outstanding foreign liabilities \ndown to $1 billion, Samruk-Kazyna signed an agreement with Alliance Bank confirming its \nintension to become a shareholder after restructuring. FMSA has accepted the conditions of the \npreliminary restructuring package and granted Alliance Bank protection from bankruptcy until 31 \nOctober 2009. Under the Government's anti-crisis plan, Alliance Bank has received a deposit of \n$200 million for liquidity support.  \n \n5.  Bank CenterCredit. Bank CenterCredit is the sixth largest bank in Kazakhstan, with a \ntraditional focus on retail business. Kookmin Bank, the largest Korean bank, has taken a large \nminority stake in Bank CenterCredit and intends to increase its ownership to 50.1% by 2011 \nthrough purchases of new and outstanding equity. Kookmin has already had a considerable \nimpact on Bank CenterCredit's board and management and has appointed its representative as \nchief  financial  officer.  As  its  competitors  are  facing  difficulties  and  thus  present  a  market \nopportunity for the bank, Bank CenterCredit is, however, focusing its efforts on consolidating its \nportfolio, as opposed to expanding its market share. Bank CenterCredit has been able to set up \n ", "                              Appendix 5  43\n      \na  fairly  reasonable  risk-management  system.  It  has  indicated  that  it  would  not  require \nGovernment support, as it has enough reserves and balance sheet liquidity. It has estimated \nthat it could withstand losses of up to 25% on its loan portfolio without requiring Government \nsupport. Its management information systems are better than its peers', and liquidity risk is \nparticularly well managed with a range of controls and substantial liquid reserves. International \nFinance Corporation and European Bank for Reconstruction and Development have recently \nprovided a liquidity support facility.    \n \n6.  Kazkommertzbank.  Kazkommertzbank  is  the  second-largest  commercial  bank. \nSamruk-Kazyna has acquired a 25% minority share and has already deposited $700 million to \nsupport liquidity. Asset quality is its foremost challenge and undermines capital levels that are \notherwise  strong  by  international  standards.  In  anticipation  of  falling  loan  repayments  and \ninaccessibility to capital markets, Kazkommertzbank built up substantial liquidity reserves that \nshould sustain it through 2009. These reserves even helped Kazkommertzbank repurchase all \n$850 million outstanding deferred payments rights securities. Kazkommertzbank is currently \nstrengthening its risk-management information technology system. Both Government support \nand  sufficient  liquidity  reserves  help  Kazkommertzbank  adequately  address  the  current \nchallenges facing by the banking sector.    \n \n.\n ", "44   Appendix 6 \nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY \n \nCountry/Project Title:  Kazakhstan/Kazakhstan Countercyclical Support Loan \n \nCentral and West Asia Department/ \nLending/Financing  Department/ \nCountercyclical Support Facility  Financial  Sector,  Public  Management, \nModality:  Division: \nand Trade Division \n       \nI.  POVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.   Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \n \nThe Asian Development Bank (ADB) has been closely engaged with the Government of Kazakhstan (the Government) since \nthe late 1990s regarding the country's poverty-reduction efforts. With ADB assistance, the Government established the \nPoverty Reduction Department in the Ministry of Labor and Social Welfare and formulated multiyear poverty-reduction \nprograms. There is evidence that these programs resulted in tangible reductions in the incidence of poverty, supported by \nstrong growth in the Kazakh economy.  \n \nThe proposed loan will help ensure that critical countercyclical expenditures are maintained and increased, including support \nfor poverty reduction and social assistance.  \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                  Targeting Classification: General intervention \n \n1.  Key Issues  \n \nPoverty Situation in Kazakhstan. On the back of an economy posting strong growth, Kazakhstan has made rapid progress \nin poverty reduction. In 1998, poverty incidence\u2014measured as the proportion of the population living below a stipulated \nminimum resource requirement \u2013 was 39%. This declined to 20% in 2004 (Figure A6).  \nFigure A6: Relation between Poverty Indexes, Real GDP per Capita and its \nGrowth Rate\n45 120,000\n40\n100,000\n35\n30\n80,000\n25\n% 20 60,000 T\n15\n40,000\n10\n5\n20,000\n0\n-5 1996 1997 1998 1997 2000 2001 2002 2003 0\nIncidence of poverty (below subsistence minimum) in %\nIncidence of extreme poverty (below food basket cost) in %\nGrowth rate of real gross domestic product (GDP) per capita\nReal GDP per capita (in 1999 tenge)\nGDP = gross domestic product. \nSource:  Pradeep  Agarwal.  2007.  Economic  Growth  and  Poverty  Reduction\u2014Evidence  from \nKazakhstan.AsianDevelopmentReview24(2):90\u2013115\n \nRecent Trends. Poverty incidence is estimated to have declined further to 13.8% in 2008. While final survey figures are not \navailable for 2008 and there is no data for 2009 yet, there is indirect evidence\u2014from the number of people applying for social \nassistance\u2014that the crisis is unlikely to have pushed more people into poverty. Kazakhstan\u2019s Social Assistance Program \nprovides minimum welfare support to those individuals defined as ultra poor, with an income equivalent to 40% of the \nsubsistence minimum or less. In 2009, the ultra poor threshold was T5,487 ($36.40), or just over $1 per person per day. In \n2008, 244,000 individuals applied for targeted support under the Social Assistance Program. In the first 6 months of 2009, \n ", "                                 Appendix 6    45\n90,000 individuals applied for such assistance. If this trend continues, the number of applicants for social assistance may in \nfact decline in 2009. However, it is quite likely that the impact of the crisis has not really percolated yet from urban Kazakhstan \ninto the rural areas. Further, coverage under the Social Assistance Program can be at best only a crude proxy, as there are \nconcerns that many of the ultra poor may not apply for assistance because of the documentation requirements or for lack of \nawareness.  \n \nUnemployment. The sectors that suffered most from the contraction in the first half of 2009 were labor intensive ones such \nas construction services, metallurgy, and mining. Together these sectors make up 35% of the economy and employ close to \n25% of the active labor force (this group is 65% men and 35% women). \n \n2.  Design  Features.  The  Kazakhstan  Countercyclical  Support  Loan  provides  budget  support  for  the  Government's \ncountercyclical public expenditures for crisis mitigation in general and social safety nets and public works in particular. The \nloan will achieve two things. First, it will help meet critical fiscal stimulus expenditures; in doing so, it will ensure predictability \nin budgetary financing for 2009. Second, it will help Kazakhstan restore some confidence in international markets, as its \naccess to capital has been severely constrained.  \n \nC.  Poverty Impact Analysis for Lending. There is clear evidence that economic growth in Kazakhstan has directly reduced \npoverty.b While the impact of the crisis on poverty incidence is still unfolding in Kazakhstan, the strong nexus between growth \nand poverty indicates that poverty incidence may increase with growth sharply declining and may do so with a time lag.  \n \nII.  SOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.  Findings of Social Analysis: The social analysis took the form of discussions with the Government, National \nCommission on Gender, industry and trade associations, and the private sector. This was supplemented by a desk review of \nother studies. In general, Kazakhstan's social protection program, including its social security arrangements, appears to be \nwell managed. Clearly, the crisis has affected the pension system, for which the Government has taken corrective measures. \nThe anti-crisis plan appears to be well received, particularly the employment-creation program.  \n \nB.

If no, explain why. During loan processing, the Mission held discussions with the Government on the \nsocial impact of the crisis. \nC.   Gender and Development \n1.    Key Issues. \n \nKazakhstan has a relatively good record in gender equality and related issues. The Organisation for Economic Cooperation \nand Development (OECD) Social Institutions and Gender Index for 2009 ranks Kazakhstan third among 102 non-OECD \ncountries on gender equality.c The country established the National Commission on Family Affairs and Gender Policy to \npromote gender issues. The Government has undertaken several initiatives to improve equality among men and women. In \n2003, the Concept on Gender Policy was approved. This was followed by the adoption of the Strategy for Gender Equality for \n2006\u20132016, which provides guidance on the tasks needed to achieve equal rights and opportunities for men and women. The \nfirst action plan for 2006\u20132008 of the strategy has been completed, and a new action plan for 2009\u20132011 is being \nimplemented. Annual gender statistics are published by the Agency of Statistics. \n \nThe economic crisis has affected generally everyone in Kazakhstan. There is no evidence as yet of any disproportionate \neffect on women when compared to men. Women\u2019s job losses compared with men\u2019s are still unclear, but there may be some \ntime lag before there is a clear indication of the crisis\u2019s impact on women. However, poverty levels are higher among women \n(60% of the poor are women), and they have more difficulty getting employed and earn less than men. Likewise, the gender \ngap in wages is around 40%. Men are also said to have benefited more from the economic progress of previous years.  \nTherefore,  given  women\u2019s  vulnerability  to  poverty,  any  increase  in  unemployment  among  women  could  have  a \ndisproportionate impact on female poverty. \n \n ", "46   Appendix 6 \nAn analysis of the distribution of employed by gender across economic activity indicates that women are employed \nproportionately less in economic activities hit by the crisis. The hardest-hit economic activities are manufacturing (\u201311.5% \ngrowth in January\u2013May 2009), construction (\u20138.3%), transport and communication (\u20137.9%), power distribution and water \nsupply (\u20137.6%), and trade (\u20136.8%). Except for trade, these activities have a higher share of men in the workforce, ranging \nfrom 63% to 75%. \n \nTable A6: Distribution of Employment by Gender and Economic Activity (%), 2007 \n   Women  Men \nTotal                48.6                 51.4  \nAgriculture, hunting, and timber                 46.5                 53.5  \nFishery and fish-breeding                18.5                 81.5  \nIndustry                33.6                 66.4  \nIncluding:     \n   Mining                26.1                 73.9  \n   Manufacturing                36.7                 63.3  \n   Production and distribution of power, gas, and water                31.7                 68.3  \n   Construction                25.8                 74.2  \nTrade; cars and home facilities                60.2                 39.8  \nHotels and restaurants                71.6                 28.4  \nTransport and communications                24.7                 75.3  \nFinance                59.4                 40.6  \nReal estate, rent, and service provision to enterprises                49.8                 50.2  \nState administration                43.9                 56.1  \nEducation                73.7                 26.3  \nPublic health and social services                76.3                 23.7  \nMunicipal, social, and individual services                55.8                 44.2  \nHousekeeping services                77.9                 22.1  \nExterritorial organizational activities                45.0                 55.0  \n Source: Agency of Statistics. 2008.

On 1 January 2009, the subsistence minimum was established at \nT13,717 (about $90.90) per person per month. In 2004, for instance, the overall subsistence minimum requirement \nwas estimated at $41.75 per day per person. Source: Pradeep Agarwal. 2007.

Government's Monitoring and Reporting Arrangements \n \n1.  The Government's monitoring and reporting system for the crisis mitigation are fairly \nelaborate (Figure A7.1). The Ministry of Economy and Budget Planning (MEBP) is the overall \ncoordinator for the anti-crisis plans (ACPs) for 2007\u20132008 and 2009\u20132010 while the Ministry of \nLabor and Social Protection (MLSP) is the coordinating ministry for the employment-generation \nprogram (i.e., Roadmap for Recovery through Job Creation). The Ministry of Finance (MOF) \nmonitors the financial flows and budget execution related to the anti-crisis measures. The \nGovernment's  Monitoring  is  done  at  various  levels.  First,  MEBP,  MOF,  National  Bank  of \nKazakhstan  (NBK)  and  Financial  Monitoring  Supervisory  Agency  (FMSA)  closely  track \nmacroeconomic  and  financial  sector  conditions  to  determine  the  impact  of  the  anti-crisis \nmeasures on key macro and financial indicators. \n \nFigure A7.1: Monitoring and Reporting System \n \n  President \n \n \nMonthly \nInteragency   Presidential \nQuarterly  Administration\nCom mittee for \nEmployment and \n \nStaff Retraining  Prime Minister \n issues  State Commission on  Working Group to \nModernization of the  control the use of \n  Economy Financial Resources \nMonth ly  Monthly  of NFRK allocated \nfor the ACP for \n \n2009-2010. \n  MOLSP   Weekly \nMEBP\n \nMonthly\n \n \nMon thly and \nWeekly \nWeekly \n \n  Line ministries (MOF,  Samruk-Kazyna \nMOTC, MIT, MOH, MOES;  MOA, MIT, MOLSP \nMOA , MOTS MOC, Local  and others), Local \n  governments  governments \nKazAgro\n \n  Financial \n  Supervision Agency \nE mployment Generation  2007-08 Crisis Measures \n  Program  and Anti-crisis Plan \n \nMOTC = Ministry of Transport and Communication; MIT = Ministry of Industry and Trade; MOH = Ministry of Health, \nMOES = Ministry of Education and Science; MOA = Ministry of Agriculture, MOTS = Ministry of Tourism and Sports; \nMOC = Ministry of Culture; MOF = Ministry of Finance; MEBP = Ministry of Economy and Budget Planning; MLSP = \nMinistry of Labor and Social Protection. \nSources: Ministry of Economy and Budget Planning; and Ministry of Labor and Social Protection. \n \n2.  Second, to implement and monitor the ACP, the Government adopted a detailed and \ntime bound action plan in January 2009 (See Supplementary Appendix A). The action plan \n(i) defines  responsibilities  of  various  government  entities;  (ii)  outlines  the  immediate  and \n ", "                                 Appendix 7    49\nmedium-term  measures  to  be  taken  by  each  responsible  body  (ministries,  government \ncompanies, banks and local governments), and (iii) clearly sets the expected outputs and \nreporting arrangements. Further, the action plan enumerates reforms in the legal and regulatory \nframework that facilitate and complement the measures under the ACP. The action plan also \nlists immediate and medium-term measures to support socially vulnerable groups and mitigate \njob losses. A similar action plan has also been adopted for the employment-generation program \n(See Supplementary Appendix B). Reports that result from these action plans provide detailed \ninformation on implementation progress, including its beneficiaries. \n \n3.  Third,  the  Government,  through  MOF  and  other  state  bodies,  monitor  the  budget \nexecution and flow of funds of the anti-crisis measures.  This uses existing public financial \nmanagement and fiduciary systems. \n \n4.  ACPs for 2007\u20132008 and 2009-2010. Samruk-Kazyna and KazAgro report to MEBP, on \na weekly basis, on disbursements by banks and other conduit entities (e.g., Damu Fund) to \nbeneficiaries. Financial Services Agency, also on weekly basis, reports on the banking system. \nThese three entities also report implementation progress, on a monthly basis, to the Presidential \nAdministration. Line ministries report to MEBP, on a weekly basis, on the effects of the crisis \nmeasures on their sectors, and their assigned tasks to support the crisis measures. MEBP \ncompiles these reports, and submits monthly reports to the prime minister. The prime minister \nreports on implementation progress to the President on a quarterly basis. \n \n5.  On the institutional side, the State Commission on Modernization of the Economy1, \nheaded by the prime minister, was formed in 2007. It meets once a week to monitor the \nimplementation of the ACP, with MEBP acting as its working body. To ensure that the use of \nfinancial resources drawn from the National Fund of the Republic of Kazakhstan (NFRK) to \nsupport the ACP is adequately monitored, the President of Kazakhstan established the Working \nGroup to Control the Use of Financial Resources of NFRK Allocated for the Anti-crisis Plan on \n19 January 2009. The working group is headed by the Chairperson of FMSA.2 The working \ngroup meets on a monthly basis where responsible bodies, such as MOF, MEBP, Samruk-\nKazyna and KazAgro, report on the use of funds. Minutes of meetings are posted in the FMSA \nwebsite. The parliament can be invited to participate in the meetings. Figure A4.2 presents the \nfiduciary monitoring system of NFRK resources allocated for the ACP for 2009-2010. \n \n6.  Employment\u2013generation program.  MLSP coordinates and compiles reports from 7 \nministries (Transport and Communication; Industry and Trade; Health; Education and Science; \nAgriculture; Tourism and Sports; and Culture) and local governments implementing the program. \nMLSP compiles reports on the disbursement and employment created by the investment in \ninfrastructure repair and reconstruction on a weekly basis.

The  Government  will  work  with  ADB, \nincluding  consultants  engaged  by  ADB  under  its  regional  technical  assistance4,  on  the \nmonitoring of the anti-crisis measures funded by budgetary expenditures. ADB missions will \nalso conduct dialogues with the State Commission on the Modernization of the Economy and \nthe Working Group to Control the Use of Financial Resources of NFRK Allocated for the Anti-\ncrisis Plan for 2009-2010 to assess the progress of and use of financial resources for the ACP. \n                                                                                                                                                          \nof Entrepreneurs \"Atameken\", Association of Employees, Samruk-Kazyna, and KazAgro,  and selected members \nof parliament. \n4  This regional technical assistance is being processed, and among activities is the monitoring and fiduciary control \nof crisis response expenditures in selected Central Asian countries.  \n ", "                                 Appendix 7    51\nLikewise, dialogues with the Interagency Committee on Employment and Staff Retraining Issue \nwill be conducted.  \n \n9.  Monitoring macroeconomic and financial sector performance. ADB will monitor and \nassess  macroeconomic  and  financial  sector  performance  during  the  program  period.  Key \nindicators to be monitored are the indicators presented in the Access Critieria 1 in Appendix 1. \nThese indicators include \n(i)  GDP growth; \n(ii)  industrial output; \n(iii)  oil revenues and output; \n(iv)  fund flows in the National Fund of the Republic of Kazakhstan; \n(v)  fiscal position, public and external debts; \n(vi)  external balances; and \n(vii)  banking sector indicators such as capital adequacy ratios, loan loss provisions \nand nonperforming loan ratios. \n \n10.

MLSP shall provide ADB, on a quarterly basis, reports on the employment, \nsocial and poverty situation, including indicators derived from the social assistance program, \nsuch as number of beneficiaries and disbursement for unemployment compensation, social \ninsurance  and  targeted  social  assistance.  To  obtain  independent  assessments,  ADB  will \nregularly  hold  discussions  with  the  International  Monetary  Fund,  World  Bank  and  other \ndevelopment  partners  to  gather  information  on  the  macroeconomic  and  fiscal  situation  in \nKazakhstan. ADB's assessments will also draw information from their staff reports and similar \neconomic reviews. \n \n11.  Monitoring the implementation of anti-crisis measures. ADB will monitor and review \nthe implementation and accomplishments of the anti-crisis measures, most especially on the \naspects of spurring economic activity and creating jobs. ADB's monitoring will focus on the anti-\ncrisis measures that are financed from the budget. MEBP and MLSP shall provide ADB, on a \nquarterly  basis,  the  implementation  reports  on  each  component  of  the  ACP  and  the \nemployment-generation program. These implementation reports will include: \n(i)  disbursements by key implementing entities of the ACP (Samruk\u2013Kazyna and \nKazAgro) and the employment-generation program (various ministries and local \ngovernments); \n(ii)  disbursements and operation of the distressed asset fund; \n(iii)  lending activities of ACP-supported commercial banks; \n(iv)  lending activities of conduit banks or mortgage companies in real estate sector \nand SMEs; \n(v)  lending and loan guarantee activities by the Real Estate and Damu Funds; \n(vi)  number  and  amounts  received  by  beneficiaries  (construction  companies, \nmortgage borrowers and SMEs), including regional disaggregation; \n(vii)  completion rates of construction projects and their regional disggegregation; \n(viii)  sectoral distribution of beneficiary SMEs; \n(ix)  implementation  progress  in  selected  agro-industrial  infrastructure  and  energy \nprojects; \n(x)  employment generation (including regional disaggregation) by the different anti-\ncrisis measures; and \n(xi)  retraining and internship program results. \n \n ", "52   Appendix 7 \n12.  Monitoring budget execution. MOF shall provide ADB, on a quarterly basis, budget \nexecution  reports  on  expenditures  incurred  by  the  Government  for  anti-crisis  measures \nsupported  by  the  budget.  This  includes  the  expenditures  on  the  employment-generation \nprogram, both on the aggregate and regional basis. MOF will ensure that the Committee of \nFinancial Control checks the expenditures made from Republican Budget to support the anti-\ncrisis measures. Likewise, such reports will be shared with ADB. In addition, ADB will review the \nminutes of the meetings of the Working Group to Control the Use of Financial Resources of \nNFRK  Allocated  for  the  Anti-crisis  Plan  for  2009\u20132010,  and  follow  up  with  the  respective \nconstituents for any subsequent verification or reconciliation. \n \n \n \n   \n \n ", "                                 Appendix 8    53\nDEBT SUSTAINABILITY ASSESSMENT \n \nA.   Background \n \n1.  Kazakhstan has consistently kept its public debt levels low and manageable. Between \n2006 and 2008, public and publicly guaranteed debt has been kept at an average of 6.4% of \ngross domestic product (GDP).1 Taking into account the asset portfolio of the country's oil fund, \nthe National Fund of the Republic of Kazakhstan (NFRK), which can be quickly mobilized to \noffset any debt shocks, net public debt is negative and averages at \u201312.8% of GDP. This clearly \nindicates that public debt is more than adequately covered and does not pose a risk to the \neconomy. Moreover, the foreign exchange risk associated with public debt is quite low, as 80% \nof public debt is domestic. The ratio of public external debt to GDP averaged at 1.5% in 2006\u2013\n2008. For 2009, excluding the Kazakhstan Countercyclical Support Loan (KCSL), the ratio of \npublic debt to GDP is expected to increase to 8.6%, and the ratio of public external debt to GDP \nis expected to increase to 1.5% of GDP. \n \nTable A8.1: Public Debt Indicators (%) \n    Public External   \nYear  Public Debt/GDP  Debt/GDP  Net Public Debt/GDP \n2006  6.7  1.8  \u201310.7 \n2007  5.8  1.4  \u201314.2 \n2008  6.6  1.2  \u201313.6 \n2009  8.6  1.5  \u201316.8 \nGDP = gross domestic product. \nNote: Public debt excludes debts by the National Bank of Kazakhstan and the local governments. \nSources: Ministry of Finance and Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n2.  While public debt has been kept low, external debt, mainly private sector liabilities, is \nlarge relative to GDP. As of end-2008, total external debt was $107.8 billion, or 79.5% of GDP \n(Table A7.1). This is expected slightly fall to $106.0 billion in 2009, but, due to the depreciated \ncurrency, this amount of external debt would be 98.9% of GDP. While these figures appear \ndaunting, it is worthwhile to note that a large part of the external debt is intra-company debt. \nAdjusting for this factor substantially brings down the ratios of external debt to GDP. For \ninstance, excluding intra-company debt, the ratio of external debt to GDP for 2008 is 52.3% and \nfor 2009 it is projected at 59.2%. In addition, NFRK and international reserves provide sufficient \ncushion to allow the authorities to mitigate risks. \n \nTable A8.2: External Debt Indicators (%) \n    External Debt/GDP \nYear  External Debt/GDP  Excluding Intra-Company Debt \n2006  91.4  59.9 \n2007  92.4  63.7 \n2008  79.5  52.3 \n2009  98.9  59.2 \nGDP = gross domestic product. \nNote: Public debt excludes debts by the National Bank of Kazakhstan and the local governments. \nSources: National Bank of Kazakhstan and Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n                                                 \n1 Public debt as defined here excludes National Bank of Kazakhstan and local government debt. \n ", "54   Appendix 8 \nB.    Public Debt Sustainability Analysis \n \n3.  Using the ratio of net public debt to GDP, baseline projections show a range of \u201312.7% \nto \u201316.8% between 2009 and 2014. Six bound tests were conducted to analyze vulnerability to \nvarious shocks. An increase in real interest rates from 3.2% in the baseline to 5.9% is expected \nto improve the ratio of net public debt to GDP throughout the projection period by 1.3%, on the \naverage. A reduction in GDP growth to 2.5% compared with the baseline of 4.1% is expected to \nworsen the debt ratio by an average of 3.3%. By 2014 under this scenario, the ratio of net public \ndebt to GDP progressively worsens to \u20137.4%. The worsening of the primary balance from a \nsurplus of 1.2% of GDP to a deficit of \u20130.2% of GDP will cause the progressive deterioration of \nthe ratio of net public debt to GDP, compared with the baseline, by an average of 5.4%. A \ncombination of interest rate, growth, and fiscal shocks results in a deterioration of the ratio of net \npublic debt to GDP by an average of 1.9%. \n \nTable A8.3: Public Debt Sustainability (%) \n      Projections \n  Item  2009 2010 2011 2012  2013 2014\nBaseline (Net Public Debt/GDP)  (16.8) (14.4) (12.7) (12.7)  (13.5) (15.0)\n               \nBound Tests             \n1  Real interest rate is at historical average  (17.2) (15.1) (13.8) (14.1)  (15.3) (17.1)\nplus one standard deviation \n2  Real GDP growth is at historical average  (16.6) (13.5) (10.7) (9.2)  (8.0) (7.4)\nplus one standard deviation \n3  Primary balance is at historical average  (15.2) (11.2) (8.0) (6.5)  (5.8) (6.0)\nminus one standard deviation \n4  Combination of 1-3 using 1/2 standard  (16.3) (13.4) (11.2) (10.6)  (10.8) (11.7)\ndeviation shocks \n5  One time 30 percent real depreciation in  (16.8) (14.4) (12.7) (12.7)  (13.5) (15.0)\n2009  \n6  Increase in other debt-creating flows in  (6.8) (4.8) (3.5) (3.7)  (4.6) (6.5)\n2009 equivalent to 10% of GDP \n( ) = negative, GDP = gross domestic product. \nSources: Government of Kazakhstan and Asian Development Bank estimates.       \n \n4.  The bound test of currency depreciation confirms that public debt is, due to the lower \nshare of public external debt, insensitive to foreign exchange shocks. A one-time 30% real \ndepreciation in 2009 indicates zero deviation from the baseline. Another bound test simulates a \nshock arising from contingent liabilities equivalent to 10% of the GDP. This is to examine the \npossible impact of the needed capital support to banks. Under this scenario, the ratio of net \npublic debt to GDP increases by an average of 9.2% in 2009\u20132014. Nevertheless, the ratio of \nnet public debt to GDP remains negative, ranging from \u20133.5% to \u20136.8%. The results of all bound \ntests suggest that public debt is resilient to a broad range of shocks. \n \n5.  Impact  of  the  KCSL  on  Public  Debt  Sustainability. The KCSL amounts to $500 \nmillion with a tenor of 5 years and a 3-year grace period. As such, the KCSL will cause the ratio \nof net public debt to GDP to increase to \u201316.4% in 2009. Assuming that the principal of the loan \nis repaid in two equal amortizations of $250 million in 2013 and 2014, a scenario is developed to \n ", "                                 Appendix 8    55\nassess the impact of the loan on debt sustainability between 2009 and 2014. Table A7.4 shows \nthat impact is quite minimal and does not compromise debt sustainability. The ratio of net public \ndebt to GDP would range between \u201316.4% to \u201312.3%, and will be relatively close to the \nbaseline.
