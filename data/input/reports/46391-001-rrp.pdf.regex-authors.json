THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nloan from the ordinary capital resources (OCR) of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and (ii) a \nproposed loan funded through the participation of the ASEAN Infrastructure Fund (AIF), all to \nthe  Socialist  Republic  of  Viet  Nam  for  the  Ha  Noi  and  Ho  Chi  Minh  City  Power  Grid \nDevelopment Sector Project.1 \n \n2.  The project will strengthen the capacities and reliability of the power infrastructure in the \ntwo largest cities of Viet Nam\u2014Ha Noi and Ho Chi Minh City\u2014through rehabilitation, expansion, \nand development of the 220 kilovolt (kV) and 110 kV electricity grids in the respective cities. The \nGovernment of Viet Nam has requested a sector loan from ADB\u2019s OCR and a sector loan \nfunded through participation of the AIF to help finance the project.2 The project is included in the \ncountry operations business plan, 2014\u20132016 for Viet Nam.3 \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n1.  Socioeconomic Context and Sector Performance \n3.  Viet Nam\u2019s economy grew steadily at an average annual rate of 6.3% during 2005\u20132012, \nand gross domestic product per capita increased from $699 to $1,755 in the same period. \nEconomic growth was accompanied by an average growth in electricity demand of 12.6% per \nannum during 2005\u20132012, while per capita consumption increased from 156 kilowatt-hours \n(kWh) in 1995 to 1,187 kWh in 2012. Viet Nam also achieved notable progress in household \nelectrification\u2014from 50% in 1995 to over 97% by 2012\u2014while reducing the poverty rate from \n15.5% in 2006 to 11.1% in 2012. \n \n2.  Institutional Arrangements \n4.  The Ministry of Industry and Trade has policy and supervisory responsibilities for the \nenergy sector, both as the line ministry and as the ministry with oversight responsibility for the \nstate-owned energy enterprises. Vietnam Electricity (EVN), the main power utility in Viet Nam, is \norganized as a holding company with a series of wholly owned subsidiaries including the three \npower  generation  corporations;4 the  National  Power  Transmission  Corporation,  which  is \nresponsible for the 500 kV and 220 kV transmission system; and the five power corporations5 \nthat are responsible for the distribution and retail of electricity at voltage levels below 110 kV, \nand for developing and operating 220 kV assets in their respective licensed areas. Hanoi Power \nCorporation (EVN HANOI) and Ho Chi Minh City Power Corporation (EVN HCMC), in particular, \nare the entities in charge of the largest load centers. Ha Noi is home to 6.5 million people and \nHo Chi Minh City has a population of 7.4 million, and together they account for 16% of the total \npopulation. \n \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  ADB provided project preparatory technical assistance: ADB. 2011.

", "2   \n3.  Sector Challenges and Opportunities \n5.  Technical.  Expanding the  power  system\u2019s  capacity  sustainably  to  meet  the rapidly \ngrowing electricity demand is a key priority of the government. According to the seventh power \ndevelopment plan (PDP7),6 demand is expected to grow from 120 terawatt-hours (TWh) in 2012 \nto 330 TWh in 2020, and potentially to 700 TWh by 2030. Thus, generation capacity is to be \nstrengthened from 26.5 gigawatts (GW) in 2012 to 70.5 GW in 2020, and over 8,000 kilometers \nof 500 kV lines and 15,000 kilometers of 220 kV lines will be constructed to transmit the \ngenerated power to the load centers.7 The total investment needs for the power sector up to \n2020 are estimated to be $48.8 billion, of which $16.3 billion is for grid expansion. \n \n6.  In the distribution subsector, the combined peak load in Ha Noi and Ho Chi Minh City \namounted to more than 6.1 GW in 2012, or 23% of the total domestic load, and is expected to \nnearly double to 11.2 GW by 2020. The investment needs during 2015\u20132020 are $1.1 billion \neach for EVN HANOI and EVN HCMC.8 \n \n7.  Financial. The foremost challenge of the power utilities is to mobilize the vast financing \nfor the above investment requirements while maintaining their financial sustainability. Although \nthere are investments made by non-EVN state-owned enterprises and domestic and foreign \nprivate investors for power generation, a large share of the investments are made by EVN \nthrough  financing  from  commercial  banks  and  development  partners.  External  borrowings \nduring 2014\u20132015 are projected to average about $130 million per year for EVN HANOI, and \n$80 million per year for EVN HCMC. \n \n8.  The retail tariff schedules are set by the government uniformly across the whole country. \nWhile the average retail tariff has increased by 79% in nominal terms during 2007\u20132013, it has \ndecreased by 15% in real terms. Moreover, the current average retail tariff of about D1,500/kWh \n(\u00a27.14/kWh) is much lower than the long-run marginal cost estimated to be in the range of \u00a28\u2013\n\u00a29/kWh. Adequate and gradual tariff increases are required to ensure the long-term financial \nsustainability of the power sector. \n \n4.  Power Sector Reform and Modernization \n9.  Viet Nam\u2019s sector reform program began in 1995, and ADB has supported it with six \ntechnical assistance (TA) projects between 1995 and 2009.9 The 2004 Electricity Law provided \nthe legal basis for the ongoing reforms, which are being implemented in line with the road map \nfor  establishing  an  electricity  market  in  three  phases:  (i)  phase  1\u2014competitive  generation \nmarket  until  2014;  (ii)  phase  2\u2014pilot  competitive  wholesale  market  from  2015,  and  full \n                                                \n6  Government  of  Viet  Nam.  2011.

The two principal documents guiding EVN HCMC\u2019s \ninvestments are Decision 6468/QD-BCT (9 December 2010) and Decision 850/TTg-KTN (22 June 2012). \n9  ADB.  1995.

The Electricity Regulatory Authority of Viet Nam (ERAV) is now preparing phase 2 \nwith the support of development partners, while ADB will dispatch resident advisors to assist \nERAV  through  an  existing  TA.11 Additional  TA  projects  to  prepare  ERAV  and  the  market \nparticipants, including the power corporations, are also being discussed and coordinated with \nthe development partners. \n \n10.  The government aims to reduce its energy intensity and increase the reliability of power \nsupply through system modernization and removal of constraints in the power grid. Viet Nam\u2019s \nelasticity ratio of electricity consumption growth to gross domestic product growth has averaged \naround 2.0. The PDP7 calls for reducing it to 1.5 by 2015, and to 1.0 by 2020. EVN has steadily \nreduced system losses from 12.2% in 2003 to 9.2% in 2012. At the distribution level, EVN \nHANOI aims to reduce system losses from 7.1% in 2012 to 6.0% by 2020, while EVN HCMC \nplans a reduction from 5.6% in 2012 to 5.0% in 2020. To further improve system reliability, both \npower corporations aim to reduce their respective system average interruption duration index by \n30%\u201340% by 2015.12 Their index numbers are very high compared with the standards of utilities \nin developed countries because antiquated equipment and inadequate capacity of the networks \ncause overloading and short circuits. \n \n5.  ADB\u2019s Sector Experience \n11.  The energy sector is one of the priority sectors in ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for \nViet  Nam,  2012\u20132015,13 which  indicates  that  assistance  will  focus  on  sector  reforms  and \ninvestments in the development of the transmission network and energy efficiency. The project \nis consistent with the draft Energy Sector Assessment, Strategy, and Road Map. Since 1994, \nADB has provided financing of $2.32 billion to Viet Nam\u2019s energy sector investments and has \nprovided support through various TA projects, including those that helped initiate power sector \nreforms. A key lesson is that project implementation can incur delays if (i) project readiness is \nlow  at  the  start  of  the  project,  (ii)  procurement  packages  are  made  excessively  small  to \nencourage participation of local bidders, (iii) adequate support is not provided to prepare bidding \ndocuments and bid evaluation reports, and (iv) support is not provided to monitor safeguard \nmeasures. The project mitigates these risks through a higher degree of readiness of core \nsubprojects\u2014bidding documents being prepared under advance contracting, and provision of \nproject implementation consultants (PICs) for procurement matters and for safeguard monitoring \nand implementation. While the number of procurement packages tends to be larger for sector \nprojects that involve multiple subprojects, packages for this project were, whenever possible, \neither  consolidated  into  larger  contracts  or  grouped  into  lots  under  single  procurement \npackages. \n \n6.  Rationale for Sector Loan Modality \n12.  The power sector is being developed consistently and in line with the PDP7, and the \n                                                \n10 Government of Viet Nam. 2006.

It is calculated as the average annual outage duration per customer served. \n13 ADB. 2012. Country Partnership Strategy: Viet Nam, 2012\u20132015. Manila. \n ", "4   \nrelevant policies in the energy sector are assessed to be appropriately contributing to meeting \nthe  growing  demand  for  energy  needed  for  socio-economic  development.  The  successful \nimplementation  by  EVN  HANOI  and  EVN  HCMC  of  sector  lending  projects  funded  by \ndevelopment  partners  demonstrates  the  executing  agencies\u2019  capacity  to  implement  the \ndevelopment plan. The modality has been recommended in project completion reports of two \nsimilar ADB-financed projects with multiple subprojects to allow flexibility toward changes in \nproject scope and subprojects during implementation.14 The sector loan approach will also \nassist EVN in improving its sector policies and strengthening the institutional capacity of its \nsubsidiaries. The World Bank\u2019s ongoing Distribution Efficiency Project helps strengthen financial \nmanagement and investment planning capacity of the power corporations, while an additional \nTA by ADB is envisaged to build the capacity of the power corporations to participate in the \ncompetitive wholesale market.15 \n \n7.  Development Partner Coordination \n13.  Given the magnitude and complexity of reforms and the financing requirements in the \npower sector, the project has been developed through in-depth coordination with development \npartners. This allows to collectively support sector reform and power infrastructure development \nin response to the rapidly growing demand for electricity. ADB\u2019s operations in the energy sector \nleverage cofinancing and encourage joint initiatives with other development partners.16 \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n14.  The  project\u2019s  impact  will  be  that  growth  in  national  electricity  demand  is  met  in  a \nsustainable manner, and the outcome will be improved reliability and efficiency of electricity \nsupply in Ha Noi and Ho Chi Minh City. \n \nC.  Outputs \n15.  The project\u2019s outputs, categorized into four distinct groups to enable more focused \nmonitoring of project performance, are the development and/or rehabilitation of (i) four core \nsubstation  and  transmission  line  subprojects  in  Ha  Noi,  (ii)  four  core  substation  and \ntransmission  line  subprojects  in  Ho  Chi  Minh  City,  (iii)  up  to  20  noncore  substation  and \ntransmission line subprojects in Ha Noi, and (iv) up to nine noncore substation and transmission \nline subprojects in Ho Chi Minh City. \n \n16.  Eight  core  subprojects  which  are  representative  of  the  types  of  subprojects  to  be \nfinanced through the project have been identified and appraised under the project preparatory \nTA to serve as models for the executing agencies to base their appraisal of the remaining \nnoncore subprojects. Bidding documents for several packages are under preparation by both \nEVN HANOI and EVN HCMC through advance contracting. The bidding document for one \npackage containing three lots has already been issued. \n \n                                                \n14 ADB. 1995.

The  project  is  estimated  to  cost  $394.27  million  (Table  1).  The  government  has \nrequested a loan of $172.70 million from ADB\u2019s OCR, and a loan of $100.00 million funded \nthrough the participation of AIF.17 The OCR loan will have a 20-year term, including a grace \nperiod  of  5  years,  straight-line  repayment  method,  an  annual  interest  rate  determined  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility,  a \ncommitment charge of 0.15% per year, and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft \nloan and project agreements. Based on this, the average loan maturity is 12.75 years and there \nis no maturity premium payable to ADB. The AIF-funded loan will have the same tenure as the \nADB loan, and an interest rate determined in accordance with its LIBOR-based lending facility, \nand it will finance the same subprojects and components as the OCR loan on a pro-rata basis.18 \nThe government will relend the proceeds of the OCR and AIF-funded loans to EVN HANOI and \nEVN HCMC pursuant to subsidiary loan agreements with terms and conditions acceptable to \nADB. \n \nTable 1: Project Investment Plan \n($ million) \nItem  Amounta \nA.

Noncore  subprojects  will  be  selected  through  the  Subproject  Eligibility  Criteria  and \nSelection Procedure.20 \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical \n21.  The eight core subprojects are either included in the PDP7 or the relevant development \nplans of the executing agencies, and a thorough review of their feasibility studies confirms that \nthey  are technically  viable. They  involve  rehabilitation  of  dilapidated substation  equipment, \ndevelopment of new substation transformer capacities in the power grid system, and expansion \nof the 110 kV and 220 kV transmission lines. The core subprojects and the indicative noncore \nsubprojects  use  established  transmission  line  and  substation  technologies  with  which  the \nexecuting agencies are familiar. \n \n22.  The project will enable more electricity to be supplied in Ha Noi and Ho Chi Minh City, \nimprove system reliability, and decrease system losses by reducing overloading. The project will \ncontribute  to  reducing  greenhouse  gas  emissions  by  460,000  tonnes  of  carbon  dioxide \nequivalent per year through replacing suppressed demand which may otherwise be supplied by \ndiesel-powered self-generation, and through system loss reduction.21  \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n23.  A  financial  analysis  has  been  carried  out  individually  for  the  core  subprojects  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Financial Management and Analysis of Projects.22  All financial costs \nand  benefits  are  expressed  in constant  2013 prices.  Cost  streams  used  to  determine the \nfinancial internal rate of return\u2014capital investment, and operation and maintenance\u2014reflect the \ncost of delivering the estimated benefits. The financial internal rates of return of 12.2%\u201337.0% \ncompare favorably with the weighted average cost of capital of 4.9%.23 \n \n24.  The economic viability takes into account streams of costs and benefits resulting from \nthe project. The economic internal rates of return (EIRRs) of the core subprojects, calculated \nindividually in accordance with ADB's Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects,24 range \nfrom 12.2% to 35.9%, which compares favorably with the 12% opportunity cost of capital. The \nsubproject selection procedure includes a criterion that, for a noncore subproject to be eligible, it \nshould have an EIRR equal to or greater than 12%, or an EIRR of not less than 10% if it is a \nsubproject with significant unquantifiable benefits.25 \n \n                                                \n20 Subproject Eligibility Criteria and Selection Procedure (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n21 Applied emissions factors are 624.4 tonnes of carbon dioxide per GWh for the grid and 764.0 tonnes of carbon \ndioxide per GWh for diesel-generation.

A review of the executing agencies\u2019 financial performances and projections found that \ntheir projected finances are reasonable but depend largely on the levels of the retail tariff (set by \nthe government) and transfer tariff (set by EVN) at which the executing agencies purchase the \nelectricity.  To  ensure  long-term  financial  sustainability  of  the  executing  agencies,  the \ngovernment shall continue to implement effective tariff reforms and adjust tariffs based on a \ntransparent methodology. ADB is also collaborating with the World Bank on its TA to improve \nthe financial positions of EVN and its subsidiaries.26 \n \nC.  Governance \n26.  Assessments  on  project  implementation  capacities,  procurement  capacities,  and \nfinancial management concluded that the executing agencies have sufficient implementation \nexperience  and  resources;  appropriate  procurement  practices;  and  adequate  financial \naccounting, reporting, and audit systems to manage the project accounts and the imprest \naccounts. It may be noted that the Financial Action Task Force has recently confirmed that Viet \nNam  has  significantly  improved  its  performance  in  combating  money  laundering  and  the \nfinancing of terrorism.27 ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained \nto and discussed with the government, EVN HANOI, and EVN HCMC. The specific policy \nrequirements and supplementary measures are described in the PAM (footnote 19). \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n27.  Since the household electrification rate in Viet Nam exceeds 97%, reliable supply of \nelectricity as a result of the project will benefit the population regardless of income and gender, \nespecially since the project targets urban and peri-urban areas. The retail tariff is being adjusted \nperiodically, although the average retail tariff is still low at about D1,500/kWh (\u00a27.14/kWh).28 For \npoorer  consumers  with  monthly  consumption  of  below  50  kWh,  the  lifeline  tariff  is  only \nD993/kWh (\u00a24.73/kWh). In addition, households categorized as poor by the Ministry of Labour\u2013\nInvalids and Social Affairs receive a direct subsidy of D30,000 ($1.42) per month for energy-\nrelated expenditures. While the retail tariff should gradually increase to ensure the sector\u2019s \nfinancial sustainability, the government is committed to retaining these social safety measures. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n28.  Environment.  The  potential  environmental  impacts  of  the  core  subprojects  were \nconfirmed  to  be  short-term  disturbances  during  construction  that  can  be  mitigated  and \nmanaged, and are not irreversible. Therefore, the core subprojects have been classified as \ncategory  B  for  environment,  and  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE)  reports  with \nenvironmental management plans have been prepared in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard \nPolicy  Statement  (2009) 29  and  are  disclosed  on  ADB\u2019s  website. 30  The  environmental \nassessment and review framework was also prepared to guide the preparation of IEEs for the \nnoncore subprojects. The subproject selection procedure includes a criterion that category A \nsubprojects  are  not  eligible.  The  executing  agencies  have  experience  in  environmental \n                                                \n26 World  Bank.  2013.

Paris. \n28 In recent years, average retail tariff was increased twice in 2012 and twice in 2013, each time by 5%.  \n29 The eight core subprojects have been grouped into four IEEs and four resettlement plans based on the similarities \nof the subprojects\u2019 characteristics and impacts. \n30 ADB.

Involuntary resettlement. The involuntary resettlement impacts of the core subprojects \nwere confirmed to involve temporary and permanent land acquisition for the development and \nrehabilitation of transmission lines and substations, but they are not severe and do not involve \nphysical displacement. The persons affected by the core subprojects were consulted about the \nproject and its impacts and mitigation measures. The core subprojects have been classified as \ncategory B for involuntary resettlement, and resettlement plans have been prepared pursuant to \nADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (footnote 29) and are disclosed on ADB\u2019s website (footnote \n30). A resettlement framework was also prepared to guide the preparation of resettlement plans \nfor  the  noncore  subprojects.  The  subproject  selection  procedure  includes  a  criterion  that \ncategory  A  subprojects  are  not  eligible.  The  executing  agencies  have  experience  in  the \nimplementation of resettlement plans through projects funded by development partners, and the \nPICs will provide further support and training to  ensure appropriate consultations, detailed \nmeasurement surveys, disclosure, and payment of compensation. \n \n30.  Indigenous people. The project will not affect indigenous people since it targets urban \nand peri-urban areas, and is thus classified as category C. \n  \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n31.  The overall risk is assessed to be low. The integrated benefits and impacts are expected \nto outweigh the costs. Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and \ndescribed in detail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.31 \n \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nContracts are numerous and small.  Contracts have been consolidated into fewer and larger packages for the core \nsubprojects,  and  the  executing  agencies  have  agreed  to  take  a  similar \napproach to the noncore subprojects. \nImplementation is delayed due to  Project implementation consultants will support the executing agencies in \ndelays in noncore subproject  subproject preparation and implementation.

The Asian Development Bank will continue the policy dialogue with \nthe government and maintain close coordination with development partners. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \nIV.  ASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n32.  The government, EVN HANOI, and EVN HCMC have assured ADB that implementation \nof  the  project  shall  conform  to  all  applicable  ADB  policies,  including  those  concerning \nanticorruption  measures,  safeguards,  gender,  procurement,  consulting  services,  and \ndisbursement as described in detail in the PAM and loan documents. \n                                                \n31 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "10   \n \n33.  The government, EVN HANOI, and EVN HCMC have agreed with ADB on certain \ncovenants for the project, which are set forth in the loan agreements and project agreement. \n \n34.  The  OCR  loan  and  the  AIF-funded  loan  are  subject  to  cross-effectiveness.  As  a \ncondition for disbursement of the loan proceeds, subsidiary loan agreements, in a form and \nsubstance satisfactory to ADB, will be duly executed and delivered on behalf of the government \nand EVN HANOI, and the government and EVN HCMC. \n \nV.
