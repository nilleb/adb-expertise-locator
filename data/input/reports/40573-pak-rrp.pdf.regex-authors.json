An  environmental  assessment  will  be  an \nintegral  component  of  project  preparation  being  undertaken  in \nparallel  for  a  proposed  ensuing  project.  The  Government  of \nPakistan  (the  Government)  will  provide  an  assurance  that  any \nensuing  project  will  be  prepared  in  accordance  with  the \nEnvironment Policy (2002) of the Asian Development Bank (ADB).  \n   \nProject Description  The  TA  project  provides  a  key  intervention  for  the  long-term \npartnership  between  ADB  and  Pakistan  to  develop  Lahore\u2019s \ntransport sector. It supports recruitment of a transaction advisor to \nhelp formulate, structure, and take to the market a public-private \npartnership for the first priority line of a proposed rapid mass \ntransit system (RMTS) in Lahore.  \n   \nRationale  Lahore is the capital of Punjab province and the second largest \ncity in Pakistan. Its population, just under 9 million, is growing at a \nrate of about 3.0% per year. Despite a number of initiatives over \nthe  years,  such  as  introducing  and  improving  fleets  of  buses, \ntraffic  gridlock  and  congestion  are  now  constraining  growth, \ncurtailing  investment,  and  reducing  the  city\u2019s  competitiveness. \nBased on feasibility studies and other analysis, the Lahore RMTS \nhas strong potential to provide an attractive and efficient option for \npublic  transportation,  an  alternative  to  private  vehicles,  and  a \ncleaner  technology  than  existing  bus  and  other  transport \ntechnologies.  In  sum,  the  proposed  RMTS  will  help  reduce \nconstraints  on  growth,  investment,  and  city  competitiveness \ncurrently imposed by the state of Lahore\u2019s transport system. \n   \nImpact and Outcome  The TA will improve the urban rapid mass transportation network \nin Lahore. The outcome of the TA is a structured design for the \nLahore RMTS Project feasible for ADB financing.  \n   \nProject Investment Plan  The investment cost of the TA project, to finance the recruitment \nof  transaction  advisor,  is  estimated  at  $7.5  million  equivalent, \nincluding foreign exchange costs of $6.0 million and local currency \ncosts of $1.5 million equivalent. \n   \n ", "ii   \nFinancing Plan  ($ million) \n  Foreign  Local  Total   \nSource  Exchange  Currency  Cost  % \nAsian Development Bank  6.00  0.00  6.00   80 \nGovernment   0.00  1.50   1.50   20 \n  Total  6.00  1.50  7.50   100 \n \n  Source: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n  A  loan  of  SDR  3,794,000  ($6.0  million  equivalent)  in  special \ndrawing rights and various currencies from ADB's Special Funds \nresources will be provided. The loan will have a 32-year term \nincluding a grace period of 8 years, and with an interest rate of \n1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum \nthereafter. \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  Until 31 December 2009 \n   \nEstimated Project  30 June 2009 \nCompletion Date \n   \nExecuting Agency  The  Planning  &  Development  Board  of  the  Punjab  provincial \ngovernment will be the Executing Agency.  \n   \nImplementation  The Planning & Development Board will engage the transaction \nArrangements  advisor and oversee the TA. It has agreed to assign a team of full-\ntime staff to assist in implementing the TA. \n \nA project steering committee for the Lahore RMTS, chaired by the \nchairman,  Planning  &  Development,  Punjab  provincial \ngovernment,  was  formed  in  April  2005,  and  provides  policy \nsupport, oversees project progress and letting and supervision of \ncontracts,  facilitates  coordination  and  cooperation  among \nagencies  concerned,  and  supervises  the  formulation  and \nimplementation of the transport integration strategy.   \n \nThe Transport Department (TD) will be the Implementing Agency \nfor the advisory services, and the TD staff and executive staff of \nthe  utilities  agencies  will  provide  additional  help  as  and  when \nnecessary.  \n   \nConsulting Services  Under the TA, a package of advisory services will be provided by \na  consultant  firm  with  expertise  and  experience  in  assessing, \nstructuring, and raising finance on the capital markets for rapid \nmass transit systems in the Asia region.  \n \nInternational and national consultants financed from ADB funds \nwill  be  recruited  as  firms  under  the  quality-based  selection \nmethod, using full technical proposals, in accordance with ADB's \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from \ntime to time).  \n   \nProject Benefits and  An urban rapid mass transit system would likely impact Lahore, \nBeneficiaries  and its large population of poor residents in a number of positive ", "  iii\nways. It would allow the city to function effectively even when \ncongestion is severe, and enable people to commute more easily \nto work. The additional capacity provided would allow the dynamic \ncity  center  to  thrive  economically,  and  over  time  help  to \nfundamentally shift the structure of the city, and guide and support \nfuture  development  in  a  more  balanced,  sustainable  manner. \nOther  road  users  would  benefit  from  reduced  congestion  and \npollution. The Government would benefit from policy options not \npreviously available that accelerate an understanding of the need \nto manage the urban transport system as an integrated whole.  \n   \nRisks and Assumptions  Major risks include capacity issues related to the ability of the \nGovernment to lead and implement the TA in a timely manner, \nand  the  maintenance  of  political  stability  and  security.  Due \ndiligence  will  assess  safeguards.  Land  acquisition  and \nresettlement could be substantial under an ensuing investment \nproject.  Intensive  consultation  will  be  required  to  ensure \ncooperation from civil society and nongovernment organizations. \n \nThe  transaction  structure,  led  by  a  credible  international \ninvestment bank, is expected to effectively attract sufficient private \nsector  interest.  Best  international  practice  for  concession \nstructures is assumed to be appropriate and applicable to the \nPakistan context. \n   \n \n ", "PAKISTAN\nLAHORE RAPID MASS TRANSIT SYSTEM PROJECT\nN\nSheikhupura Road ShaShtdaabrliang Yard 0 1 2 3 4\nBund Road\nKilometers\nMahmood Booti\nShariqpur Road SHAH BAGH\nTimber Market\nIslam Park North Depot\nBadshahi Masiid Pakistan Mint Mahmood Dera Gujran\nDate Darban Salamatpura\nMotorway (M-2) SagjanS aIgnjatenr Bcyhpaanssge Jinnah Hall CenLtraaklshami SultaUnEpTura BaghbaSnMhpaUularGamHarA GLaPrdUenRA\nCanal\nRegal Chowk\nLake Road\nRavi River Chauburji Fatima Jinnah\nGulshan-e-Pavi Qurtaba\nSamanabad\nShama Chowk\nBabu Sabu\nBund Ichhra\nSalahudin\nCana\nShahnoor\nAllama Igbal\nCaLnahaorle  VBypieaHsswanjaWrwaahldSAaawtbaznazar Wahdat Road Canal Garden TMoTwoowndenl KalmMao dInetl eTrochwann NgeortWhalton Road BIendtiaenr nRaoatdional Airport\nNiaz Baig Model Town South\nM.A. Johar \nTown Ghazi Road\nKot\nWalton\nAli Town Lakhpat\nTownship\nStabling Yard Ghazi\nRaiwind Rd.\nWapda\nTarmiz-ud-Din Road Green Town Nishter 63o  00'E 73o  00'E\nNORTH-WEST\nFRONTIER\nShadab\nMain Depot 35 o 00'N AFGHANISTAN Tarbela 35 o 00'N\nISLAMABAD\nDepot/Yard Green Line (Elevated Viaduct) Hamza PeshawSInaduas rR.rgoJdhhelaum R.CheJnMahb eaR.nluglma\nLahore\nNational Capital Green Line (Underground) Dera Ismail Khan MP uUl tNa nJ A BRavi R.\nProvincial Capital Orange Line (Phase 2) Quetta Project Location\nCity/Town Blue Line (Phase 3)\nPAKISTAN Sutlej R\nInterchange Purple Line (Phase 4)\nRailway Station River B A L O C H I S T A N\nProposed Station Provincial Boundary IRAN Indus R.\nNational Road International Boundary 26 o 00'N S I N D H 26 o 00'N\nOther Road Boundaries are not necessarily authoritative.\nINDIA\nExisting Railway Hyderabad\nCanal ARABIAN   SEA Karachi\n63o  00'E 73o  00'E\n08-0031 HR", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  report  and  recommendation  on  a  proposed \ntechnical assistance (TA) loan to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan for preparing the Lahore Rapid \nMass Transit System Project. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n \n2.  In  its  medium-term  development  framework,  the  Government  of  Pakistan  (the \nGovernment) committed to enhancing the competitiveness of, and quality of life in, its large cities. \nA high-level committee led by the Planning Commission is coordinating urban development, with \nLahore as one of the core components of a long-term economic development strategy. Vision \n2020 for Pakistan highlights the vital role to be played by the urban sector in realizing national \ndevelopment goals. Urban centers such as Lahore are to be developed within the framework of \nstrategic master plans, incorporating economic parameters for efficiency gains to make cities \ncompetitive in the global and regional context. Lahore is seen as one of the great cities of the \nworld, a major entertainment, intellectual, and commercial hub imbued with rich cultural heritage. \n \n3.  The Government asked the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for assistance to develop a \nrapid mass transit system (RMTS) for the city of Lahore, as part of ADB\u2019s growing engagement in \nthe country\u2019s urban infrastructure and services sector. The Punjab provincial government (PPG)  \nhas undertaken extensive preparatory work to assess the feasibility of the proposed system, \nutilizing  a  public-private  partnership  (PPP)  approach,  which  envisages  a  long-term  plan  to \nfinance, construct, and operate four mass rail lines interconnected to multimodal transport. The \nGovernment has requested ADB support to recruit a highly qualified international advisory team \nto design the transaction and take it to the market for private sector financing. Engagement of a \ntransaction  advisor  will  ensure  that  the  proposed  PPP  structure  is  sound,  based  on  best \ninternational practice, and attracts the best possible partners from the private sector.  \n \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n \n4.  Economy. Lahore, the capital of populous Punjab province, and second largest city of \nPakistan, is the cultural, political, and educational center of Pakistan. Lahore\u2019s economic base is \nbroad and varied. A major industrial agglomeration with about 9,000 industrial units, it has shifted \nin recent decades from manufacturing to service industries. Some 42% of its work force is \nemployed in finance, banking, real estate, community, cultural, and social services. The city is the \ncountry\u2019s largest software producing center, and hosts a growing computer-assembly industry. \nLahore has the second largest stock exchange in the country.  \n \n5.  Demography. Punjab is Pakistan\u2019s most urbanized province, with roughly 36% of its \npopulation living in urban areas. According to the 1998 census, Lahore had a population of  \n4.5 million in 1998, up from 2.7 million in 1981. Based upon the intercensal (1981\u20131998) annual \ngrowth rate, the current population of Lahore is estimated at 7 million. The population in the \nproject area covered by the Lahore RMTS was estimated to be around 8.7 million in 2006, and is \nforecast to increase to about 16.2 million by 2025 at an annual average growth rate of around \n3%. \n \n6.  Megacity  Development  Trends.  The  geographic  location  and  economic  potential  of \nLahore have drawn both labor and capital for many decades, but the city has never been in a \nposition to maximize this potential for its own benefit. Little investment has been made in the \ncity\u2019s infrastructure over the past two decades; traffic congestion is now unmanageable and \nconstrains economic growth. New investments and new additions to the labor force are not \noptimally located in the city, resulting in haphazard development, a polluted urban environment, \nand, for many households, poor quality of life.  \n \n ", "2   \n7.  Poverty. Based on the 2001 poverty line1 and personal incomes for fiscal year 20022 for \nLahore, 30% of the city\u2019s total population is poor. The incidence of poverty varies in the nine \ntowns  in  the  city.  The  highest  incidence  is  in  the  more  than  300  katchi  abadis,  which  are \ninformally developed and poor settlements and houses and home to about 35%\u201350% of the city\u2019s \ntotal population. The vast majority of the population in katchi abadis live below the poverty line.  \n \n8.  Urban  Environment.  Lahore  faces  and  causes  significant  environmental  issues  and \npressures. All of Lahore\u2019s domestic and industrial wastewater is untreated, and finds its way \ndirectly  or  indirectly  to  the  Ravi  River.  Many  of  Lahore\u2019s  industries  generate  a  mixture  of \nchemicals and toxic substances, the bulk of which is discharged into the river or creeks. Vehicle-\ngenerated  air  pollution  is  severe,  with  high  concentrations  of  suspended  particulate  matter \ncausing respiratory problems for a large number of Lahore\u2019s residents.  \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n \n1.  Urban Transport: A Constraint to Growth  \n \n9.  With a current population of about 9 million, Lahore is growing at 3.32% per annum. The \nnumber of vehicles has phenomenally increased in recent years, resulting in heavy congestion, \nslower traffic, increasing road accidents, waste of fuel and person-hours, and environmental \ndegradation. Despite a number of initiatives, such as introducing fleets of buses, the growing \nproblems of gridlock and congestion now constrain growth, curtail investment, and reduce the \ncity\u2019s competitiveness. \n \n10.  The  transport  network  has  been  inadequately  developed  and  maintained.  This  is \nexacerbated by the diversity of the traffic mix and lack of traffic and pedestrian discipline. In the \npast, 18-seater minivans dominated public transport services; however, rising incomes of the \ngrowing population have generated an increase in travel demand and the desire for higher quality \ntransport.  Properly  organized  routes  and  new  services  have  been  introduced,  increasing \nwillingness to pay premium fares and a desire for better services. \n \n11.  One potential solution, a proposed light rail transit system, was first studied as part of the \nJapan International Cooperation Agency\u2019s Comprehensive Study of the Transportation System in \nLahore in 1991. This was reviewed and updated under the 1993 World Bank-funded Lahore \nTraffic and Transport Studies. In 2005, the concept was revisited, and the Government financed a \nfeasibility study, which was completed in July 2006. The next phase is a reference design study, \nnow under way, which will take the RMTS design to 30%\u201335% completion, sufficient for the \nscheme to attract funding. \n \n12.  On 19 October 2006, the Government approved concept clearance for the Project, and \nearly implementation of an efficient and effective RMTS for Lahore. The system is expected to \n \n(i)  increase commercial and residential development; \n(ii)  minimize duplication and overlapping on public transport routes; \n(iii)  maximize ridership through an integrated multimodal system; \n(iv)  offer better service in terms of speed, frequency, and easy accessibility to reduce \ncar and motorcycle dependency; \n(v)  provide  safe,  secure,  environmentally  sustainable,  reliable,  and  dependable \ntransport that meets needs and aspirations of this growing city; and \n                                                 \n1\n The poverty line adopted by the Government is based on a caloric norm of 2,350 calories per adult per day and \nminimum  nonfood  requirements.  This  poverty  line  approximates  PRs748.6  per  month  per  adult  in  FY2001 \n(Government of Pakistan. 2003. Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper. Islamabad.)  \n2\n The income calculations are based on (i) figures for monthly income range and percentage of households in the \nHousehold Income and Expenditure Survey, 2001\u20132002; and (ii) Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper.  ", "  3\n(vi)  link  the  center  of  Lahore  and  its  rapidly  developing  suburbs  with  fast  and \nconvenient access. \n \n13.  The feasibility study, covering 5% of the required design work, outlines an integrated \nstrategic network of four lines of about 82 kilometers (km) long with 60 stations. The first phase \nwill address a 27 km priority line (the green line), which includes 11.6 km underground passing \nthrough  environmentally  sensitive  and  heritage  areas.  The  line  is  estimated  to  carry  about \n250,000\u2013300,000 passengers per day in the first year, 2013, providing direct walk-in access for \npassengers through 22 planned stations (12 underground and 10 elevated). The green line would \nprovide seamless connectivity to the city center for commuters from outside Lahore through two \nplanned multimodal terminals, one at each end. Additionally, the line is planned to have five \ninterchange stations with future lines. \n \n14.  The ultimate capacity of the green line is estimated to be 30,000 passengers per peak \nhour per direction. Initially, each train would comprise four cars, 48 meters long, doubling to a set \nof eight-car trains in later years. The feasibility study estimates the cost of the green line at  \n$2.4 billion; this estimate is being confirmed through the follow-on reference design study, and \nwill be further refined. A description of the proposed green line project is in Appendix 2. \n \n15.  The Government is aware that passenger fares will not cover the full cost of building, \nfinancing, operating, and maintaining the system; and that subsidies will be required to cover the \ndifference between project costs and revenues from passenger fares. The PPG, building on its \npositive experience with privately operated bus services, is keen to use PPP arrangement to \ndevelop the Lahore RMTS.  \n \n16.  In support of project development, ADB retained a team of consultants to independently \nanalyze the economic and financial feasibility of the Lahore RMTS, and to identify and analyze \nvarious PPP arrangements to develop this system.3 The results from the options analysis study \nconfirm  that  the  Lahore  RMTS  is  economically  viable  according  to  ADB  standards,  at  an \neconomic internal rate of return of 11.40%, with a number of unquantified benefits. The economic \ninternal rate of return is estimated to increase to 12.34% if the green line is developed with an \nalternative tunneling technique, and with a few other less significant changes. The study also \nfound that the green line would require a subsidy with a present value of $1.6 billion in order to be \nfinancially viable, with a total cost of $2.4 billion (since revised downward to $2.1 billion).  \n \n17.  The options analysis study team recommended a PPP structure in which the Government \nand a private concessionaire enter into two related contracts: (i) a design-build contract for civil \nworks, and (ii) a build-operate-transfer contract for the remainder of the system. Both contracts \nwould be with the same private firm. In this structure, Government would raise the capital needed \nto pay for the civil works and the subsidy needed to cover the difference between the non-civil-\nwork cost of the RMTS and the revenue from passenger fares. The civil work payments would be \nmade  up-front,  but  the  subsidy  would  be  paid  over  time.  The  recommended  PPP  option \n(Appendix 3) optimizes the risks shared between the public and private sector. \n \n  2.  External Assistance and Lessons from ADB Assistance  \n \n18.  The  TA  acknowledges  lessons  from  previous  ADB  and  other  development  partner \ninterventions in the urban sector in Pakistan, and aims to incorporate these into the transaction \ndesign, as well as any proposed follow-on investment. Since 1976, ADB has provided eight loans \nto the urban sector, totaling about $450 million. Urban loans in Pakistan have generally been \nrated as unsatisfactory.   \n                                                 \n3  Castalia. 2007. Lahore Rapid Mass Transit System\u2013Financial and Economic Analysis, and Analysis of Public-Private \nPartnership Options. \n ", "4   \n19.  ADB\u2019s experience in Pakistan shows that successful implementation of inherently complex \nurban sector projects demands (i) simple project design and execution arrangements, (ii) close \ncoordination between the multiple agencies involved, (iii) development of institutional capacities, \nand  (iv)  generation  of  public  support  for  program  interventions  through  the  involvement  of \nstakeholders.  Urban  programs  also  need  to  address  (i)  delays  in  project  implementation, \nespecially at start-up; (ii) delays in land acquisition; (iii) the slow pace of government approvals; \n(iv) lack of timeliness and adequacy in the release of counterpart funds; (v) delays in selection of \nconsultants; and (vi) problems in achieving sustainability of project assets. \n \n20.  The TA design addresses these issues by (i) structuring the subsequent public investment \nprogram as a multitranche financing facility; (ii) adopting a simple program design in one urban \nsubsector; (iii) linking physical projects to clear and well-focused sector reforms; and (iv) keeping \nexecution and implementation arrangements simple and embedded in existing institutions. \n \n21.  Other development partners have been active in the urban sector, primarily the World \nBank.  Bilateral  assistance  has  been  provided  by  the  governments  of  Germany,  Kuwait, \nNetherlands, Switzerland, and United Kingdom. The United Nations Development Programme, \nUnited Nations Children's Fund, and World Health Organization have also provided assistance, \nmostly in community water supply and sanitation projects. Details on external assistance in the \nsector are provided in Appendix 4. \n \n  3.  Summary of the Rationale \n \n22.  The quality, coverage, and reliability of infrastructure and services, particularly in urban \ntransport, have not kept pace with the rapid growth of Lahore\u2019s economy and population in recent \nyears.  Insufficient  and  unreliable  infrastructure  and  services  are  (i)  adding  to  business  and \nhousehold costs, (ii) compromising Lahore\u2019s urban and natural environments, (iii) decreasing the \ncity\u2019s global competitiveness when compared with other South Asian cities, and (iv) diminishing \nthe quality of life of all of Lahore\u2019s citizens. \n \n23.  Traditional government  sources,  including  local  government  revenues,  subsidies,  and \ntransfers, cannot meet the growing gap between urban infrastructure and service demand, and \ncurrent supply. This holds particularly true for development of a major mass rail transit system. \nAlternative sources of financing and new ways of providing infrastructure and services, such as \nPPP, are required. The proposed Lahore RMTS, to be developed through the services of a \ntransaction advisor, would move the city squarely in this direction. \n \n24.  The TA and follow-on project processing will build on the work already undertaken by the \nPPG. PPG\u2019s urban unit has developed an urban sector road map, with the Lahore RMTS serving \nas  a  focus  for  investment.  The  road  map  (supplementary  appendixes)  provides  a  strategic \nframework for sector development, including a reform agenda and sector investment plan, from \nwhich an ADB-supported investment program is being derived. \n \n25.  A segregated rapid transit system, providing fast and convenient access between the \ncenter of Lahore and its rapidly developing suburbs, would offer numerous benefits. By providing \nan alternative to road-based transport, passengers will trade off the greater reliability and faster \njourney times offered against the premium fare charged. System benefits include \n \n(i)  reduced road traffic and congestion,  \n(ii)  decreased pollution (by using electricity, which is cleaner and quieter),  \n(iii)  time savings to travelers, and  \n(iv)  reduced bus and wagon flow at key points by 50% for certain segments.   \n ", "  5\n26.  The  Government  understands  that  developing  the  Lahore  RMTS  with  a  PPP  would \nprovide an opportunity to improve the overall efficiency of the system. A PPP provides the \nGovernment  with  an  opportunity  to  efficiently  allocate  risks  between  the  Government  and \nspecialized private firms. This means that risks will be controlled and influenced by the party that \nis best placed to control and influence these risks.  \n \n27.  A PPP, however, would not make sense for the Government or private sector if either \nparty were bearing risks that are better handled by the other. This means that a well-structured \nPPP is essential to achieve the objectives expected from a PPP. Examples of key issues that \nneed to be resolved as part of structuring a PPP transaction include the following: \n \n(i)  Public versus private funding. The passenger fares that the Government plans \nto charge for the green line will not cover the full cost of building, operating, and \nmaintaining the line. The Government will need to subsidize a portion of the capital \ncosts. What portion would be funded by the Government, where would these funds \ncome from, and how would these funds be paid are key issues to be resolved. \n \n(ii)  Ridership risk. While the Government should bear part of the ridership risk, the \nprivate  operator  should  also  have  incentives  to  maximize  ridership.  Thus  the \nprivate operator should bear a portion of the ridership risk. What portion and under \nwhat terms are key issues to be resolved. \n \n28.  To address these and other issues that will emerge during implementation of the green \nline, the Government will need support from a team of dedicated and specialized consultants. \nMost of the consultants that the Government has recruited or plans to recruit are engineering or \nridership forecasting experts who will provide valuable support on the technical aspects of the \nProject. To structure a successful PPP transaction, however, the Government will need the \nsupport  of  a  transaction  advisor  experienced  with  large-scale  and  complex  urban  transport \nprograms and international best practice in mass transit system financing and design. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n29.  The TA project will improve the urban rapid mass transportation network in Lahore. The \noutcome of the TA is a structured design for the Lahore RMTS Project feasible for ADB financing.  \n \n30.  The expected impact of the TA is the initiation of a long-term transport system investment \nprogram that will enable Lahore to make a greater contribution to national development, while \nimproving the quality of life for city residents, including the poor. The RMTS is expected to \n \n(i)  increase commercial and residential development; \n(ii)  minimize duplication and overlap on public transport routes; \n(iii)  maximize ridership through an integrated multimodal system; \n(iv)  offer high service in terms of speed, frequency, and easy accessibility; \n(v)  reduce car and motorcycle dependency; \n(vi)  provide  safe,  secure,  environmentally  sustainable,  reliable,  and  dependable \ntransport that meets the needs and aspirations of this growing city; and \n(vii)  link the center of Lahore and its rapidly developing suburbs with fast, convenient \naccess. \n \n31.  Prior to consideration of ADB project financing, engagement of a transaction advisor is \nrequired to formulate financial structuring, undertake detailed due diligence, and package the \nLahore  RMTS  to  attract  private  capital  and management.  The  transaction  advisor,  in  close \n ", "6   \nconsultation with ADB and the Government, will help prepare and launch a PPP transaction for \nthe green line. ADB is willing, in principle, to partly finance the public-sector-financed portion of \nthe Project under the multitranche financing facility modality. The outline terms of reference for \nthe transaction advisor are in Appendix 5. \n \nB.  Outputs \n \n1.  Sequence of Major Tasks \n \n32.  The  transaction  advisory  work  will  be  carried  out  in  three  phases:  preparation, \nimplementation, and negotiation. During the preparation phase, the transaction advisor will carry \nout technical and legal due diligence, design the detailed structure and terms of the transaction, \nmarket  the  transaction  with  potential  investors,  and  develop  prequalification  and  bidding \ndocuments as well as the necessary contracts. During implementation, the transaction advisor \nwill  assist  the  Government  in  obtaining  any  approvals  and  permits  required,  prequalifying \npotential investors, carrying out the bidding process, evaluating proposals, awarding the contract, \nand holding negotiations with lenders. During the negotiation, the transaction advisor will support \nthe Government and winning bidder reach financial closure.  \n \n   a.  Phase I, Transaction Preparation  \n \n33.  The transaction preparatory work will include technical, legal, regulatory, financial, and \nsafeguards due diligence in support of the proposed transaction. The transaction advisor will lead \nefforts to market the transaction, including tasks such as (i) preparation of initial marketing \ndocument, an  information memorandum, and presentations; (ii) preparation of a list of investors \nthat have the qualifications and experience to be the project counterpart; and (iii) consultations \nwith potential investors and lenders to share information about the Lahore RMTS. The transaction \nadvisor will also advise on progress made in preparing the transaction; and review feedback on \nthe design of the transaction. International road shows may be required. \n \n   b.  Phase II, Transaction Implementation  \n \n34.  The transaction advisor will assist the Government in obtaining or issuing the necessary \npermits or approvals needed for implementing the transaction for the Project. These might include \napproval  to  (i)  create  and  fund  a  subsidy  account,  (ii)  issue  a  government  guarantee,  and  \n(iii)  launch  prequalification  and  bidding  process.  The  transaction  advisor  will  assist  the \nGovernment in (i) issuing the request for prequalification, responding to questions from interested \nparties, evaluating the expressions of interest, and selecting a short list of firms; (ii) issuing the \nrequest for proposals and responding to questions from bidders; and (iii) assessing the legal \ncompliance  of  the  proposals,  evaluating  the  quality  of  the  technical  proposals  and \ncompetitiveness of the financial proposals, and making an award decision. \n \nc.  Phase III, Negotiations  \n \n35.  Following the award of the contract to a bidder, financial closure for the transaction will \nrequire several months. During this period, the transaction advisor will assist the prospective \nlenders of the winning bidder in carrying out their credit analysis and, to the extent needed, assist \nthe Government in negotiating with these lenders. \n \nC.  Project Investment Plan \n \n36.  The  TA  investment  cost  is  estimated  at  $7.5  million  equivalent,  comprising  foreign \nexchange costs of $6.0 million and local currency costs of $1.5 million equivalent (Table 1). \nDetailed costs estimates are in Appendix 6. ", "  7\n \nTable 1: Investment Plan \n($ million) \n  Foreign  Local  Total \nItem  Exchange  Currency  Cost \nA.  Base Costs     \n  A.  Consultant Services  5.50    5.50 \n      B.

Financing Plan \n \n37.  The Government has requested a loan of SDR 3,794,000 ($6,000,000 equivalent) from \nADB\u2019s Special Funds resources to finance 80% of the total TA costs. The loan will have a term of \n32 years including a grace period of 8 years, an interest rate of 1.0% per annum during the grace \nperiod and 1.5% per annum thereafter, and such terms and conditions as set forth in the draft \nloan document. The Government will provide the remaining $1,500,000 equivalent, or 20% of the \ntotal TA cost, to cover local currency costs. As most of these funds will be provided in kind for \nprogram support in the form of workshops, surveys, office space, and related local support, the \navailability of counterpart financing should not be an issue. The Government has been advised \nthat  approval  of  the  TA  loan  does  not  commit  ADB  to  financing  any  ensuing  project.  The \nGovernment will relend the loan proceeds to the PPG on terms and conditions satisfactory to \nADB. The financing plan is in Table 2. \n \nTable 2: Financing Plan \n($ million) \nSource  Total  Percent \nAsian Development Bank  6.0  80.0 \nPunjab Provincial Government  1.5  20.0 \n  Total  7.5  100.0 \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n1.  Management  \n \n38.  The Planning & Development Board (P&D  Board) of the PPG will be the Executing \nAgency for the TA. With its capacity, mandate, and cadre of professional staff to provide strategic \nand policy guidance, the P&D Board will be a powerful champion for the Lahore RMTS. It will \nengage and oversee the transaction advice, and has agreed to assign a team of full-time staff to \nassist in implementing the TA. \n \n39.  A project steering committee (PSC) for the Lahore RMTS, chaired by the PPG\u2019s chair of \nplanning and development, was formed in April 2005. It includes the secretaries of transport, \nfinance, communication and works, and housing and urban development; nazim (Lahore city \nmayor); and district coordination officer of the city district government of Lahore. The secretary of \ntransport  acts  as  the  PSC  secretary.  The  PSC  provides  policy  support,  oversees  project \nprogress, oversees letting and supervision of contracts, facilitates coordination and cooperation \namong agencies concerned, and supervises the formulation and implementation of the integration \nstrategy.   \n \n ", "8   \n40.  The Transport Department (TD) will be the Implementing Agency (IA) for the advisory \nservices, and the TD staff and executive staff of the utilities agencies will provide additional help \nas and when necessary. \n \n41.  During the course of the TA, the Government will work on the institutional and regulatory \narrangements required to implement the Lahore RMTS, including integration of other transport \nsystems. Other departments will have key roles; effective coordination is essential. A technical \ncoordinating committee will coordinate the project works, traffic and access arrangements, and \nland requirements. A TA organization chart is in Appendix 7. \n \n2.   Implementation Period \n \n42.  The TA is expected to be implemented over 1 year and 4 months, from April 2008 to July \n2009. The implementation schedule is in Appendix 8. \n \n3.  Consulting Services \n \n43.  A package of advisory services will be provided from a consulting firm with expertise and \nexperience in assessing, structuring, and raising finance on the capital markets for RMTSs in the \nAsia region. International and national consultants financed from ADB funds will be recruited as \nfirms under the quality-based selection method, using full technical proposals, in accordance with \nADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). The PSC will \nbe fully involved in the selection process. Consulting services will include experts in the field of \ntechnical mass transit system engineering, design, and transport mode integration; commercial \naspects; financial and economic analysis; legal and regulatory aspects; safeguards related to the \nenvironment, resettlement, and social development; private sector participation and concession \nstructures; and institutional development and public finance. \n \n44.  The Government will take advance actions to expedite project implementation, particularly \nby short listing firms to provide consultancy services for transaction advice. The advance actions \nwill apply only until evaluation of bids. Contract award and signing of an agreement will take place \nonly  after  loan  effectiveness.  The  Government  acknowledges  that  ADB\u2019s  concurrence  with \nadvance actions does not commit ADB to finance the Project. \n \n4.   Advance Contracting \n \n45.  To meet its accelerated time frame for implementing the Lahore Rapid Mass Transit \nSystem Project, the Government is keen to commence recruitment of the transaction advisor as \nsoon  as  practicable.  The  Government  has  asked  ADB  to  approve,  in  principle,  advance \ncontracting  for  the  recruitment  of  consultant  advisory  services  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants.  \n46.  Advance  contracting  allows  the  Government  to  undertake  procurement  or  consultant \nselection procedures at its own risk prior to the loan becoming effective. The Government has \nopted for advance contracting without retroactive financing, in which case the consultant selection \nprocedures completed under advance contracting do not conclude with the award of contract until \nafter the loan becomes effective. The Government and PPG acknowledge that they undertake \nsuch  advance  contracting  at  their  own  risk,  and  that  any  concurrence  by  ADB  with  the \nprocedures, documentation, or proposal for award of contract does not commit ADB to approve \nthe TA loan or to finance recruitment costs.  \n ", "  9\n5.  Anticorruption Policy \n \n47.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  Government  and  PPG.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance, \naccountability, and transparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its \nagents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the Project. To \nsupport these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the loan \nregulations and the bidding documents for the TA. In particular, all contracts financed by ADB in \nconnection with the TA shall include provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and examine \nthe records and accounts of the PPG and all contractors, suppliers, consultants, and other \nservice providers as they relate to the TA. \n \n6.  Disbursement Arrangements \n \n48.  Disbursements under the TA loan will be made in the form of direct payments from ADB to \nthe international investment bank, based upon the payment schedule outlined in the final contract \nfor consultant services.  \n \n7.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n \n49.  TD will monitor TA progress to provide a basis for reporting to the Government and ADB, \nand prepare monthly  progress reports on implementation. The reports will contain sufficient \ninformation to enable the PSC to monitor progress, identify issues, and ensure compliance with \nthe TA objectives. The PSC will consolidate the monthly progress reports into quarterly reports for \nsubmission to ADB. These quarterly reports will include (i) progress made against established \ntargets, (ii) problems and issues encountered and remedial actions taken or proposed to resolve \nthe issues, and (iii) proposed project activities to be undertaken as well as progress expected \nduring  the  subsequent  implementation  period.  Each  report  will  also  contain  an  executive \nsummary with content and format that allows ADB to readily capture key information for use in TA \nperformance reports. The PSC will provide a TA completion report to ADB within 3 months of the \ncompleted  disbursement,  providing  details  about  project  implementation,  accomplishments, \ncosts, benefits, impacts, and other information requested by ADB. \n \n8.  Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n \n50.  The PSC and TD will monitor and evaluate TA project performance in accordance with the \nterms of reference and the design and monitoring framework. Primary monitoring targets for each \ncomponent will be agreed between the PSC and ADB;. The PSC and ADB will use these targets \nin accordance with the established reporting schedule. \n \n9.  Project Review \n \n51.  ADB and the Government will jointly undertake inception, midterm, and final reviews of the \nTA project. The reviews will assess progress for each component, identify issues and constraints, \nand determine necessary remedial action and adjustments. The midterm review will (i) review the \nscope, design, and implementation arrangements and identify adjustments required; (ii) assess \nprogress of project implementation against performance indicators; and (iii) recommend changes \nin the design or implementation arrangements, if necessary. \n \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n \n52.  Beneficiaries. The Lahore RMTS, once implemented, would benefit large numbers of \npeople day-in and day-out in Lahore. Other road users will benefit from somewhat reduced \ncongestion and pollution; and the Government will benefit from policy options not previously \n ", "10  \navailable that will accelerate an understanding of the need to manage public transport and the \nurban transport system as a whole.  \n \n53.  Poverty Reduction and Social Development Impact. An urban rail system will impact \nLahore and its large population of poor residents in several positive ways. It will allow the city to \nfunction effectively even when congestion is severe, and allow people to commute to work. The \nadditional capacity provided will allow the dynamic city center to thrive economically, and over \ntime  help  to  fundamentally  shift  the  structure  of  the  city,  and  guide  and  support  future \ndevelopment in a more balanced, sustainable manner. A summary poverty reduction and social \nstrategy is in Appendix 9. \n \n54.  Financial Benefits and Sustainability. The Lahore RMTS should be viewed in terms of \nits overall impacts\u2014on efficiency, city development, the environment (micro and macro), energy \nsavings, and cost to the Government. \n \n55.  Assumptions. The transaction structure, led by a credible international investment bank, \nis assumed to effectively attract sufficient private sector interest. Best international practice for \nconcession structures is assumed to be appropriate and applicable to the Pakistan context. \n \n56.  Risks. Major risks include capacity issues related to the ability of the Government to lead \nand implement the TA in a timely manner. Due diligence will assess safeguards, and both land \nacquisition  and  resettlement  could  be  substantial  under  the  larger  transaction.  Intensive \nconsultation  will  be  required  to  ensure  cooperation  from  civil  society  and  nongovernment \norganizations. The maintenance of political stability and security is assumed. \n    \n57.  Environmental and Social Safeguard Issues. The TA is not expected to have any \nadverse environmental or social impacts. It will ensure development of an environmentally and \nsocially viable investment program through an intensive due diligence process. Any follow-on \ninvestment  loan  will  be  prepared  in  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  environmental  assessment \nrequirements, social safeguards policies (on involuntary resettlement and indigenous peoples), \nand applicable government environment laws and regulations. The establishment of the overall \nRMTS will be compliant with the same requirements.  \n \nV.  ASSURANCES  \n \n58.  In  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n   \n(i)  The  Government  will  ensure  that  adequate  environmental  measures  in \naccordance  with  ADB  Environment  Policy  (2002)  and  applicable  government \nenvironment laws and regulations are incorporated into the design of the ensuing \nproject.  \n(ii)  The  Government  will  avoid  and  minimize  land  acquisition  and  resettlement \noccurring  under  any  follow-on  loans  and  the  establishment  of  the  RMTS.  If \navoidance is not feasible, resettlement plans will be prepared and implemented in \naccordance with (a) the Government\u2019s applicable laws and policies, and (b) ADB\u2019s \nInvoluntary Resettlement Policy (1995). The overall operation will be prepared in \naccordance with (a) the Government\u2019s applicable laws and policies related to \nindigenous peoples, and (b) ADB\u2019s Policy on Indigenous Peoples (1998). These \npolicies will be incorporated in the project design. \n(iii)  The Government will ensure that the follow-on project will incorporate gender \nstrategies to promote equal treatment of women and men. \n(iv)  The Government will provide adequate resources and facilities to implement the \nTA and all its components effectively through the P&D Board and TD. ", "  11\n(v)  The Government will ensure that all draft final reports of feasibility and advisory \nstudies under the TA will be submitted to ADB for review. \n(vi)  The Government will ensure that detailed terms of reference approved by ADB will \nbe incorporated in each consultant\u2019s contract.  \n \nVI.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n59.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve the loan in various \ncurrencies equivalent to three million seven hundred ninety four thousand Special Drawing Rights  \n3,794,000 to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan for preparing the Lahore Rapid Mass Transit \nSystem Project from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources with an interest charge at the rate of 1.0% \nper annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter; a term of 32 years, including \na grace period of 8 years; and such other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance \nwith those set forth in the draft Loan and Project Agreements presented to the Board.  \n \n \nHaruhiko Kuroda   \nPresident     \n \n \n26 March 2008 \n ", "12  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance  Data Sources/  Assumptions  \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Reporting Mechanisms   and Risks  \nImpact      Assumption \nLahore RMTS green line  ADB review monitoring  The Government is \nCompleted and \noperational  committed to sustainable \ncommissioned by 2013 \nurban transport \ndevelopment in Lahore. \nOutcome      Assumption \n  Completed PPP  Monitoring against  \u2022 PPG remain committed to \nFunding by private  transaction for private  benchmarks on  PPP and related reforms \nsector and ADB/other  sector concession by Oct  performance of city district \nRisk \ndevelopment partners  2009  government and other city \n\u2022 TA implementation and \nsecured    agencies \nthe reform agenda are \nADB multitranche \n  TA progress reports  delayed. \nfinancing facility loan \n \napproved for public sector  ADB review missions \ninvestment by Dec 2008 \nTA completion report \nOutputs      Assumptions \n1.

The proposed design for the green line provides for 10 elevated and 12 underground \nstations. The total length of the line will be 27 kilometers, 15.4 of which are elevated and 11.6 \nunderground. The green line will have an underground section in the city center because of tight \ncurves and narrow streets, and restrictions and preservation considerations. This will also reduce \nthe environmental impact of the Project.  \n \n2.  The green line follows the Ferozepur Road corridor. In the south, it begins just north of the \nHudiara drain road bridge. The southern-most station is Hamza Town. The alignment reference \npoint (Chainage 0+000) is taken from the end of the lead track about 300 meters south of Hamza \nTown. The northern-most station is across Ravi River in Shahdara Town.  \n \n3.  From the Hamza Town station, the alignment follows Ferozepur Road on an elevated \nviaduct structure (single track U girder) in the road\u2019s central median, up to the Pakistan Railway \nflyover. Here the green line is diverted on one side. It returns to the central median north of the \nrailway flyover up to the model town north, where it descends into a tunnel via a ramp and follows \nthe middle of Ferozepur Road; it is then diverted to the west. The bored tunnel alignment follows \nthe central median of Ferozepur Road, crossing the interchange with Gulberg Main Boulevard and \nthe canal. North of the canal, the alignment returns to the centerline of Ferozepur Road up to the \nQurtaba  junction,  where  a  sharp  right  turn  is  required  to  follow  Fatima  Jinnah  Road.  As  it \napproaches the assembly building, the tunnel alignment turns sharply to the left toward Mall \nRoad. The tunnel alignment then proceeds along Mall Road to the junction close to Nasir Bagh. \nHere, the alignment turns sharply right onto the Lower Mall and proceeds to Circular Road (west \nsection). It then ascends back to the viaduct in the middle of Ravi Road after Data Darbar Station. \nFrom Ravi Road, the route crosses Bund Road and Ravi River to the northern end at Chainage \n26+721 about 500 meters north of the northern terminal station in Shahdara Town.  \n \n4.  Stations will be spaced approximately 1 kilometer apart throughout the central section of \nthe line. Stations are designed for compliance with National Fire Protection Association Code 130: \nStandard for Fixed Guideway Transit and Passenger Rail Systems (2007), with the forecast peak \nnumbers of passengers boarding and alighting at each location. Station platforms are provided \nwith platform screen doors. Underground stations are air-conditioned. Escalators are provided to \nimprove vertical circulation and user accessibility. The station entrances will be integrated with the \nbus stops located on the roads nearby. Also, a link (tunnel or footbridge) will be provided for \npedestrians to cross the road.   \n \n5.  A medium capacity mass transit train is proposed. Ultimately, the train will comprise six \ncars articulated and connected. For the early stage, the trains will comprise only three to four \ncars. As demand grows, the length of the trains will be doubled. At 102 meters long, station \nplatforms are designed to accommodate the six-car train that will be used in later years. The \nultimate capacity of the train will be 1,040 passengers. \n \n6.  Round-trip time is estimated at about 86 minutes, and a minimum headway of 2 minutes is \nassumed for ultimate peak hour provision. This is calculated to require 46 trains to provide peak \nhour service, and assumes a requirement of one spare train for operation reserve and seven \nspare trains for maintenance reserve, giving a total ultimate requirement of 54 trains (324 cars). \n \n7.  The earliest that the green line can be open to the public is late 2012, providing that initial \nconstruction begins during the first quarter of 2008. Ultimately, demand for the proposed green \nline is estimated to be 30,000 passengers per peak hour per direction.  \n ", "14  Appendix 3 \nRECOMMENDED PRIVATE-PUBLIC PARTNERSHIP OPTION \n \n \n1.  The options analysis study team reviewed international best practice, and developed the \nfollowing public-private partnership (PPP) options for consideration. The PPP option will be \nadopted following assessment and validation by the transaction advisor. \n \n(i)  Option one. A build-operate-transfer (BOT) contract with a private firm. \n \n(ii)  Option two. A design-build contract for civil works and a BOT contract for the \nremainder of the Project with one private firm. In this option, the Punjab provincial \ngovernment (PPG) finances the cost of the civil works. \n \n(iii)  Option three. A design-build contract for civil works, a contract to supply and \ncommission  electrical  and  mechanical  equipment,  and  an  operation  and \nmaintenance contract, with one private firm. In this option, the PPG finances all \ncapital costs. \n \n(iv)  Option four. An engineering and construction contract for civil works with one \nfirm,  and  a  contract  for  the  supply  and  commissioning  of  electrical  and \nmechanical equipment and an operation and maintenance contract with a second \nfirm. In this option, the PPG finances all capital costs. \n \n(v)  Option five. An engineering and construction contract for civil works with one \nfirm, and a concession contract for the remainder of the Project with a second \nfirm. In this option, the PPG finances the cost of the civil works. \n \n2.  Based on current understandings as described in this report of the PPG\u2019s objectives and \ntheir relative importance, the PPG may be better off adopting a PPP structure similar to option \ntwo. In this option, the PPG and a private concessionaire enter into a design-build contract for \ncivil works and a BOT for the remainder of the Project. The PPG raises the capital needed to \npay for the civil works, as well as to pay for the subsidy needed to cover the difference between \nthe non-civil-work costs of the Project and the revenues from fares paid by passengers. The civil \nwork payments will be made up-front, but the subsidy will be paid over time. If the PPG wishes \nto, this option could be altered to have the subsidy paid upfront.  \n \n3.

Under the design-build contract, the concessionaire designs and builds the civil works \nand transfers ownership to the PPG at the end of the contract, which, as in option one, is \ntypically 20\u201330 years. The PPG secures financing for the civil works portion of the Project. \nDuring construction of civil works, the PPG pays the concessionaire based on construction \nmilestones reached, as under a conventional construction contract.  \n \n5.  The  concessionaire  may  subcontract  this  work  to  a  specialized  firm  through  an \nengineering, procurement, and construction contract. The subcontract would contain the same \ntypes of provisions described in option one, i.e., deadlines with corresponding penalties and \nspecifications to ensure quality. The concessionaire mitigates construction risk through this \nsubcontracting arrangement by transferring it to a firm with specialized knowledge of how to \nbest manage it. \n \n6.  A  BOT  contract  would  cover  all  aspects  of  the  Project:  civil  works,  supply  and \ncommissioning of electrical and mechanical equipment (including rolling stock), and operation \nand maintenance of the system. The contract scope is essentially the same as the BOT contract \nin  option  one,  without  the  civil  works  component.  The  concessionaire  will  secure  private \nfinancing  for  the  electrical  and  mechanical  (E&M)  and  rolling  stock  capital  costs.  Its \nshareholders will provide equity for approximately 20%\u201330% of the costs. To mitigate operating \nrisk and risks related to finishing construction of the system, the concessionaire may enter into a \nsubcontract with a firm to supply and commission electrical and mechanical equipment, and \noperate and maintain the system.  \n ", "16  Appendix 3 \n7.  Passenger fares are not sufficient to cover the full cost of service. As discussed in the \ndescription of option one in the study, several mechanisms will be needed to make the Project \nattractive to the private sector and bankable: \n \n(i)  a subsidy per passenger (for options one, two, and five); \n(ii)  a minimum revenue or minimum ridership guarantee; and  \n(iii)  a guarantee of the PPG\u2019s obligations from a third party, or a fiduciary fund to \ncover the cost of its obligations. \n \nThe net present value of the PPG\u2019s subsidy in this case, including financing the capital costs of \nthe civil works, is approximately $1.6 billion. \n \n8.  The allocation of risks in this option is similar to their allocation in option one, with the \ndifference that the PPG bears risks related to financing of civil works. The PPG also bears risks \nrelated  to  obtaining  right-of-way.  The  concessionaire  bears  risks  related  to  construction, \nfinancing of electrical and mechanical equipment, and operation and maintenance. The parties \nshare ridership risk through the guarantee mechanism. \n \n9.  The PPG will retain the services of a transaction advisor to help the PPG move forward \nwith selecting an appropriate PPP option, and with preparing the documentation for procuring \nthis PPP option. The terms of reference of the transaction advisor include a set of tasks that will \nhelp the PPG to reach a decision on an appropriate PPP option. These tasks include \n \n(i)  reviewing and prioritizing with the PPG the importance of the objectives and \ndesign considerations set out in the Castalia report;1  \n(ii)  carrying out the technical and legal due diligence for the Project; \n(iii)  reviewing the PPP options presented in this report, and suggesting any changes \nthat are necessary as a result of the due diligence findings; and \n(iv)  developing a financial model that can be used to quantify the subsidy required \nfrom the PPG, as well as the value of the contingent liabilities associated with \nvarious forms of guarantees. \n                                                 \n1  Castalia. 2007.

Lahore, the second largest urban center in Pakistan, is the provincial capital of Punjab. \nWith a current population of about 9 million, the megacity is growing at around 3.0% per annum. \nThe number of vehicles has also phenomenally increased in recent years, resulting in heavy \ncongestion,  slower  traffic,  increasing  road  accidents,  waste  of  fuel  and  person-hours,  and \nenvironmental degradation. Despite a number of initiatives, such as introducing fleets of buses, \nthe  problems  of  gridlock  and  congestion  have  grown  to  the  point  of  constraining  growth, \ncurtailing investment, and reducing the city\u2019s competitiveness. \n \n2.  To  resolve  this  serious  transport  issue,  during  the  early  1990s  the  Japanese \nInternational  Cooperation  Agency  (JICA)  sponsored  a  comprehensive  study  of  the \ntransportation system in Lahore. The study identified and analyzed several mass rapid transit \nsolutions, and concluded that a light rail train system along the Ferozepur Road would be a \nfeasible  solution.  Subsequently,  in  1993  the  World  Bank  funded  the  Lahore  Traffic  and \nTransport Studies, which essentially reviewed and updated the earlier JICA-funded work. In \n2005, the Punjab provincial government (PPG) retained MVA Asia Limited to analyze in more \ndetail the feasibility of the light rail train system along the priority corridor proposed by the JICA \nstudy (green line). This work was concluded in August 2006 and included1 \n \n(i)  a  review  of  available  data  and  conduct  of  citywide  travel  demand  surveys, \ngeotechnical investigations, and a topographic survey of the priority corridor; and \n(ii)  a design for the alignments, stations, systems, and operations for the green line \nto a 5% level of detail. \n \n3.  In 2006, the PPG again retained MVA Asia Limited to analyze the feasibility of the \nsecond priority line (orange line). This report is complete. The green and orange lines will \noverlap at one station, therefore the future development of the orange line will likely have a \nmaterial impact on ridership of the green line.  \n \n4.  In 2007, the PPG decided to take the green line feasibility study to a higher level of detail \nbe retaining Systra, the parent company of MVA Asia Limited, to carry out the reference design \nof the green line. The key output of this work is the design of alignments, stations, systems, and \noperations for the green line to a 35% level of detail.2  \n \n5.  In 2007, the Asian Development Bank (ADB), as part of its due diligence for the green \nline and anticipating a possible lending operation, commissioned a group of individual experts \n(the ADB consultants) to review the MVA Asia Limited ridership forecasts and cost estimates \nand analyze the economic and financial viability of the line. This work included identifying \nvarious public-private partnership (PPP) options that the PPG could consider for developing the \ngreen line.3 \n \n5.  The development of the green line is a priority project for the PPG. The Government is \nwell aware that passenger fares will pay will not be sufficient to cover the cost of developing the \nProject, and in particular, the capital costs. Despite being financially unviable, the Government \nis committed to implementing the Project because the Government expects it to revolutionize \nthe city and eventually add value to the local economy. Evidence of this commitment is the \n                                                 \n1  The final report prepared by MVA Asia Limited is available for consultation. \n2  The terms of reference for Systra\u2019s work are available for consultation. \n3  The results of this work are available for consultation. ", "Appendix 5  21 \nallocation in the province\u2019s development budget of around $500 million per year for the next 5 \nyears to cover the funds needed to make the Project financially viable. \n \n6.  The Government has had positive experiences with PPPs in other provincial projects, \nand in particular, with intra- and intercity bus services. As a result, the Government wants to \ndevelop the green line under a PPP arrangement. The Government agrees in principle with the \nPPP structure recommendations made by the ADB consultants.  \n \n7.  To  prepare  and  implement  the  PPP  transaction  for  developing  the  green  line,  the \nGovernment wishes to engage the services of a transaction advisor. This document outlines the \nterms of reference for this advisor. \n \n8.  The work of the transaction advisor will be facilitated by the significant work already \ncompleted on the feasibility and engineering aspects of the green line, as well as by the \nGovernment\u2019s strong commitment to implementing the green line. \n \nA.  Scope of Work \n \n9.  The  transaction  advisory  work  will  be  carried  out  in  three  phases:  preparation, \nimplementation, and negotiation. During the preparation phase, the transaction advisor will  \n(i) carry out technical and legal due diligence, (ii) design the detailed structure and terms of the \ntransaction, (iii) market the transaction with potential investors, and (iv) develop prequalification \nand  bidding  documents  as  well  as  the  necessary  contracts.  During  implementation,  the \ntransaction  advisor  will  assist  the  PPG  in  obtaining  any  approvals  and  permits  required, \nprequalifying  potential  investors,  carrying  out  the  bidding  process,  evaluating  proposals, \nawarding the contract, and holding negotiations with lenders. During negotiation phase, the \ntransaction advisor will support the PPG to reach financial closure.  \n \n1.  Phase I, Transaction Preparation  \n \n10.  The preparatory work will include technical, legal, regulatory, and financial inputs.  \n \na.  Technical \n \n11.  The services to be provided by the consultants will cover, but not be limited to, the \nfollowing areas. \n \n(i)  Carry out technical due diligence. This consists of reviewing previous studies, \nincluding the feasibility study and reference design reports, to understand and \npackage: \n \n(a)  operating  design  parameters  (cruising  speed,  commercial  speedway, \nminimum headway, etc.), selected infrastructure (alignment, utilities, civil \nworks, etc.), and technology (vehicle design, car body, signaling system, \ncommunication system, fare collection system, power supply, etc.); \n(b)  ridership forecasts, and key assumptions underlying these forecasts, as \nwell as changes in ridership associated with these assumptions; \n(c)  transport system integration, particularly public transport and passenger \naccess/egress arrangements; \n(d)  environmental  impact  of  the  Project  with  respect  to  domestic  and \ninternational standards, and cost associated with mitigating that impact; \n ", "22  Appendix 5 \n(e)  right-of-way requirements, and plans for obtaining these rights as well as \nan estimate of their associated costs, and documentary requirements for \nland acquisition and involuntary resettlement of participating international \nfinancing institutions; and \n(f)  capital  (civil  works,  land,  electrical  and  mechanical  equipment,  etc.), \noperation, maintenance, and rehabilitation costs; and contingencies. \n \n(ii)   Forecast expected nonfare revenue from commercial activities, that is, revenue \nother than from passenger fares. This involves reviewing experience of other \nmass rapid transit systems with specific commercial services or activities that \nhave generated revenue, assessing the extent to which commercial services and \nrevenue-generating activities can be replicated in Lahore, and forecasting the \nrevenue that could be expected from those that can be replicated in Lahore. This \nwork will include field research and surveys to be carried out by a commercial \nreal estate expert. \n(iii)  Review and update the project implementation schedule, including expected time \nfor obtaining rights-of-way, obtaining permits, completing other preconstruction \nwork, construction, testing, and commissioning.  \n(iv)  Review and update technical inputs needed for the financial model, such as \nbreakdown of capital costs, operation and maintenance costs, passenger and \nnonpassenger revenue, and other related items. \n(v)  Write the technical sections of the information memorandum. Most of this content \nis readily available in the feasibility study and reference design reports. \n(vi)  Provide technical inputs for the contractual documents and agreements. This will \ninclude  inputs  used  in  defining  each  party\u2019s  obligations  with  respect  to  the \nimplementation, construction, commissioning, operation, and maintenance of the \nsystem; as well as detailed specifications and procedures for the design, testing, \nand commissioning of the Project. \n(vii)  Define the information that bidders should include in their technical proposal, and \ndevelop the templates that bidders should use to submit this information. \n(viii)  Develop the methodology for comparing or evaluating the technical proposals \nreceived from bidders. \n \nb.  Legal  \n \n12.  The services to be provided by the consultants will cover, but not be limited to, the \nfollowing areas. \n \n(i)  Carry  out  legal  due  diligence.  This  comprises  reviewing  relevant  legislation \nrelated to the development, procurement, construction, financing (public/private), \noperation,  and  regulation  of  mass  rapid  transit  systems  to  understand  and \npresent the following: \n \n(a)  legal  viability  of  the  proposed  transaction  structure,  including  legal \nauthority to contract the design, financing, construction, and operation of \nthe system; \n(b)  process and approvals needed to procure the contract with the private \nfirm  that  will  develop  the  Project,  including  estimating  the  time  to \nimplement this process; \n(c)  process and approvals needed to secure the funds that the PPG will \ncontribute  to  the  Project,  including  funds  sourced  from  multilateral ", "Appendix 5  23 \ndevelopment banks and including an estimate of the time required to \nimplement this process; \n(d)  process and approvals needed to obtain a guarantee from the federal \nGovernment (if any), and for accessing the viability gap funds that the \nfederal Government will make available for PPP projects, including an \nestimate of the time required to implement this process; \n(e)  process and approvals needed for obtaining rights-of-way or acquiring \nland, including an estimate of the time required to implement this process, \nand  documentary  requirements  for  land  acquisition  and  involuntary \nresettlement of participating international financing institutions; \n(f)  approvals and permits needed to build the system, including construction \npermits and environmental permits; and \n(g)  existing incentives, like tax exemptions and others, to promote foreign \ninvestment in the Project. \n \n(ii)  Write the legal sections of the information memorandum. \n(iii)  Support the PPG in drafting the contractual documents and agreements, and in \nthe  prebid  negotiation  of  these  documents  with  potential  investors  during \nconsultation meetings with investors. \n(iv)  Assist in designing the prequalification and bidding process and in drafting the \nprequalification documents, request for proposal, and instructions to bidders; as \nwell as the prebid negotiations of the latter two. \n \nc.  Regulation  \n \n13.  The services to be provided by the consultants will cover, but not be limited to, the \nfollowing areas. \n \n(i)  Based  on  the  legal  team\u2019s  review  and  the  proposed  transaction  structure, \npropose options for economic regulation of the services to be provided by the \ngreen line. In principle all the rules, procedures, and formulas with respect to \nsetting, adjusting, monitoring and enforcing service standards should be included \nin the contract between the PPG and the investors. \n(ii)  Discuss these options with the PPG and potential investors and lenders. \n(iii)  Design  and  draft  the  detailed  provisions  needed  to  implement  the  preferred \neconomic  regulatory  option,  including  (a)  regulatory  guidelines;  (b)  job \ndescriptions, internal procedures and policies, as well as their corresponding cost \nestimates; and (c) legal documentation to establish agency and secure funding. \n \nd.  Financial/Commercial \n \n14.  The services to be provided by the consultants will cover, but not be limited to, the \nfollowing areas. \n \n(i)  Develop a detailed financial model for the Project. The model should forecast the \nfinancial statements of the private special purpose company that will be the main \ncounterpart to the PPG; calculate the amount, timing, and present value of the \nsubsidy required from the PPG, and determine the present value of the expected \npayments from guarantees offered by the Government. \n(ii)  Identify the risks associated with the transaction and propose options for an \nefficient  allocation  of  these  risks  between  the  Government  and  private \n ", "24  Appendix 5 \ncounterpart,  as  well  as  mechanisms  for  mitigating  these  risks  (including \nguarantees). The allocation of risks should aim to strike a balance between two \nobjectives: (a) minimizing the cost of the Project to the Government, including \ncontingent  costs  associated  with  guarantees;  and  (b)  enhancing  the \nattractiveness of the transaction to private investors, and therefore attract offers \nfrom a number of bidders. The allocation of risks will be discussed and agreed \nupon with the PPG. Potential investors\u2019 and lenders\u2019 comments should be taken \ninto account when designing the allocation of risks. \n(iii)  Prepare  the  drafting  instructions  for  the  legal  team  that  will  develop  the \nnecessary contracts and agreements. \n(iv)  Define the information that bidders should include in their financial proposal, and \ndevelop the templates that bidders should use to submit this information. \n(v)  Develop the methodology for comparing or evaluating the financial proposals \nreceived from bidders. In principle, this methodology should give incentives to \nbidders to minimize the subsidy they require from the Government. \n(vi)  Lead efforts to market the Project, including  \n \n(a)  prepare  marketing  documents  including  at  least  initial  marketing \ndocuments information memorandum and Power Point presentations; \n(b)  prepare and regularly update a list of investors that have the qualifications \nand experience to be the counterpart to the PPG for this project; include \nprivate  lenders  that  would  likely  be  interested  in  lending  to  the \ncounterpart; and  \n(c)  hold regular consultation meetings with potential investors and lenders to \ninform them about the Project, to inform them about progress made in \npreparing the transaction, and to receive their feedback on the design of \nthe transaction. This might include international road shows. \n \n2.  Phase II, Transaction Implementation  \n \n15.  The services to be provided by the consultants will cover, but not be limited to, the \nfollowing areas. \n \n(i)  Permits and approvals. Assist the PPG in obtaining or issuing the necessary \npermits or approvals needed for implementing transactions for the Project. These \nmight include approvals to (a) create and fund a subsidy account, (b) issue a \ngovernment guarantee, and (c) launch prequalification and bidding processes. \n(ii)  Prequalify  investors.  Assist  the  Government  in  issuing  the  request  for \nprequalification,  respond  to  questions  from  interested  parties,  evaluate  the \nexpressions of interest, and select a short list of firms.4 \n(iii)  Issue request for proposals. Assist the Government in issuing the request for \nproposals, and responding to questions from bidders. \n(iv)  Evaluation and award recommendations. Assist the PPG in assessing the \nlegal  compliance  of  the  proposals,  evaluating  the  quality  of  the  technical \nproposals and competitiveness of the financial proposals, and making an award \ndecision. \n \n                                                 \n4  This assumes that the process for selecting the private investor will involve an initial stage for prequalifying firms. \nThe  Government  might  however,  decide  to  use  a  different  procurement  process  that  does  not  involve  a \nprequalification stage.

POVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.   Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \n \nBased on the country poverty assessment, the country partnership strategy, and the sector analysis, describe how the \nproject would directly or indirectly contribute to poverty reduction and how it is linked to the poverty reduction strategy of \nthe partner country. \n \nThe proposed follow-on investment program in urban transport for the Lahore rapid mass transit system (RMTS) and \ninstitutional reform of public service provision are consistent with the goals and strategies of the poverty reduction \napproach of the Government of Pakistan and the Asian Development Bank (ADB). The Povery Reduction Strategy Paper \nstresses, among others, access to public services, improved governance, job creation, and community participation as key \ndevelopment needs and priorities of the poor. Insufficient economic growth and employment, gender disparities, and \ninadequate community empowerment are observed to be among the main causes of poverty. In response, aims of the \npoverty reduction strategy include the development of supportive infrastructure for accelerating economic growth, civil \nservice reforms, as  well as improved governance and public service delivery. Social mobilization and community \nparticipation  are  viewed  as  essential  for  improved  governance  and  ownership  of  poverty  reduction  programs  by \nbeneficiary communities. Sustainable pro-poor growth, devolution of power to local communities, development of public-\nprivate partnerships (PPP) in infrastructure provision including the development of transport systems, and mainstreaming \nof environmental issues are among the investment priorities of the Poverty Reduction Partnership Agreement between the \nGovernment and ADB. \nIn its medium-term development framework, the Government committed to enhance the competitiveness of, and quality of \nlife in, its large cities. The Government constituted a high-level committee led by the Planning Commission to coordinate \ndevelopment of its megacities, including Lahore. Vision 2020 for Pakistan highlights the vital role to be played by the urban \nsector in realizing national development goals. Improved transport through the Lahore rapid mass transit system will \nenhance public safety and the quality of the urban environment, and specifically provide opportunities for women to travel \nfor health, education, and employment. Women are socially discouraged from traveling on the existing public transport \nsystem  given  its  dilapidated  and  gender  insensitive  state. The  Project  supports the  poverty  reduction  strategy  by \npromoting institutional reform and organizational development to encourage pro-poor development and fiscal responsibility \namong providers of public infrastructure services. It will improve governance and the participation of the poor by consulting \nstakeholders, including low income communities, on the Project through public awareness and outreach. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                  Targeting Classification: General intervention  \n \nNational, Provincial, and Local Poverty Context: \nPoverty in Pakistan declined from 34.5% in 2001 to 23.9% in 2005 in the wake of overall economic growth and increased \npro-poor government spending. However, at the same time, the income and expenditure gaps between the poor and the \nwealthier, especially the urban rich, have widened considerably. Seventy percent of the population remains vulnerable to \npoverty in the long term. The poor tend to have larger households and less access to essential assets and services, \nincluding electricity, water supply and sanitation, cooking gas, and telephones. The incidence of poverty is highest among \nthe employment groups of wage laborers, sharecroppers, and the self-employed; and among the occupational groups of \nunskilled wage laborers, and skilled and craft workers. It is highest in the agriculture, construction, transport, and \nmanufacturing sectors. Poverty is clearly associated with landlessness and smallness of landholdings; as well as lack of \nliteracy and educational attainment.  \n \nOnly scant disaggregated data is available on the status of poverty for the city district of Lahore. Approximately 30% of the \ntotal population of 7 million lives below or at the poverty line. And about 30% of the population live in the more than 300 \nkatchi abadis (informally developed and poor settlements and homes. The majority of katchi abadis inhabitants receive \ninferior public services. Generally, poverty in the city is characterized by a lack of reliable employment, insufficient and \nirregular income, limited access to quality and higher education and health care, deficient basic infrastructure and \nservices, and a lack of secure ownership or tenure of housing.  \n \nSupport of a new rapid mass transit system that links a network of feeder busses, serving all of the city\u2019s townships and \n ", "Appendix 9  31 \ninner city, will facilitate safer, faster, and more comfortable transport for all sectors of the city population, including the \nresidents of the katchi abadis, and reduce severe traffic jams and air pollution.  \n \nII.  SOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.   Findings of Social Analysis \n \nA stakeholder analysis is being carried out by the reference design team and will run in parallel to the proposed technical \nassistance (TA) loan. This effort is complemented by two stakeholder engagements carried out as part of the ongoing \ncommunications strategy of the Punjab provincial government (PPG). Other workshops are planned over the near-term \nunder the reference design team. These workshops target beneficiaries, the private sector, the executing agency, \nimplementing  agencies,  concerned  government  departments,  civil  society  representatives,  and  nongovernment \norganizations. Following these activities, ADB project processing for the subsequent loan program will undertake further \nstakeholder analysis and outreach.  \nB.  Consultation and Participation \n1.   Provide a summary of the consultation and participation process during the project preparation. \n \nStakeholder consultations are being conducted by the reference design team, and a participation strategy is being \ndesigned as part of its outreach component. Key stakeholders include government and civil society organizations, user \ngroups, nongovernment organizations, media, academia, and representatives of program beneficiaries and affected \npeople. The outcomes of these meetings are providing feedback to the project designers, and will be incorporated in the \nfinal project design. The meetings and outreach program are also facilitating public support for the Project through active \ninvolvement of stakeholders. The participation strategy will be elaborated as project processing for the follow-on loan \nprogram is undertaken \n \n2.   What level of consultation and participation (C&P) is envisaged during the project implementation and monitoring?  \n  Information sharing          Consultation         Collaborative decision making       Empowerment \n \n3.   Was a C&P plan prepared?   Yes      No  \nIf a C&P plan was prepared, describe key features and resources provided to implement the plan (including budget, \nconsultant input, etc.). If no, explain why. \nThe process is ongoing and will be addressed during project preparation of the ensuing multitranche financing facility loan. \n \nC.   Gender and Development \n1.   Strategy to maximize impacts on women: \nThe ensuing investment loan will directly and indirectly benefit women through better access to reliable, safe, and \naccessible urban transport. The primary concerns of women need to be addressed in the program design (road map) and \nwill be part of the consultative process, which should specifically target women\u2019s participation in design and monitoring of \nimplementation of the Project. The severe shortage of adequate transport and harassment of women in public and private \nbuses will be addressed in the design and implementation of the RMTS and feeder bus system, with special attention to \naffordable rates, seats for women, and preventive measures to deal with physical harassment. ADB\u2019s investment to \naddress these service delivery and infrastructure needs is critical to reducing women\u2019s time spent on such issues and thus \nfreeing time for engagement in income generating activities or leisure and family time. In the provision of project-generated \nemployment to the poor, women will be targeted and equal pay will be provided for work of equal value.  \n2.  Key Actions. Measures included in the design to promote gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment\u2014access to \nand use of relevant services, resources, assets, or opportunities and participation in the decision-making process: \n    Gender plan          Other actions/measures         No action/measure \n \nThe process is ongoing and will be addressed during project preparation of the ensuing multitranche financing facility loan. \n ", "32  Appendix 9 \n \nIII.
