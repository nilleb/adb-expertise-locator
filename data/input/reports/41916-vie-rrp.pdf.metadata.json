Viet Nam\u2019s Economy \n1.  Overview and Outlook \n2.  Viet Nam has made significant gains in improving its economy and alleviating poverty.  \nDuring the period from 2003 to June 2006 it was the second fastest-growing economy in Asia, \nwith gross domestic product (GDP) growth rates of between 7.0 and almost 8.5%.1  The GDP \ngrowth rate is expected to be about 8.2% for 2006.2  The World Bank notes that poverty levels \nhave decreased from 70% to less than 20% currently. Real income levels have grown by about \n7% per year over the last 10 years.3  The Government is committed to making the transition to a \nmarket economy within the next 5 years and has implemented a number of reforms. As a \nreflection of the improved investment climate, foreign direct investment (FDI) was approximately \n$10.2 billion in 2006.4  A current account surplus of 0.3% of GDP in 2006, combined with strong \nFDI flows, yielded Viet Nam\u2019s highest foreign exchange reserves to date of $13.4 billion.5  The \nforecast average inflation rate for 2007 is 7.8%.6 \n \n3.  The medium-term outlook for Viet Nam\u2019s economy is positive. The country\u2019s 5-year \ntarget for 2006\u20132010 for GDP growth rates is between 7.5 and 8.0%. Viet Nam benefits from a \nnumber of factors that will likely sustain the strong growth rate: (i) a young, rapidly growing \nworkforce with literacy rates at 93%;7 (ii) strong growth opportunities in the manufacturing sector, \nwhich are supported by the Government\u2019s continued reforms and which are expected to result in \nFDI at approximately $18 billion in 2008 (footnote 6); and (iii) membership in the World Trade \nOrganization (WTO), which solidifies the progress the country has made and the Government\u2019s \ncommitment to reforms. Appendix 1 provides more detail on the country\u2019s macroeconomic and \npolitical outlook. The country is rated BB\u2013 by Fitch Ratings, BB by Standard & Poor\u2019s, and Ba2 \nby Moody\u2019s ratings agency.  \n \n2.  Challenges for the Future \n4.  Viet Nam will need to address certain challenges in the medium-term in order to sustain \nits positive growth pattern.  It must control the government deficit and general government debt, \nand continue reforms in the state-owned enterprise (SOEs) and state-owned commercial bank \n(SOCBs) sectors. Government revenues have been strong in the past due to high oil prices.8  \n                                                 \n1 Biallas, Margarete, and Hanh Nam Nguyen. 2006.

Hong Kong: UBS Investment Research (28 January).  \n8  Approximately 30% of the Government\u2019s revenue is from oil revenues. ", "2       \nWith the anticipated decrease in oil prices, however, and continued government expenditure on \nnecessary infrastructure investments, the government deficit is expected to increase in 2007 \nand 2008. The deficit amounted to 1.2% of GDP in 2006, and is projected to increase to 2.3% in \n2007 and 2.5% in 2008, and remain at approximately this level until 2011.9 SOE debt has been \ngradually declining to about 29% of GDP in 2006 and is expected to decline further as the \nGovernment moves forward with its plans for equitization (footnote 6). It is important that the \nGovernment hasten the pace of reform of SOEs and SOCBs to improve the overall performance \nof these entities, thereby reducing nonperforming loans (NPLs), and to assist them in adapting \nto a market economy. The Government has introduced policies to provide a comprehensive \nlegal framework, which should help to increase the pace of equitization.  \n \nB.  The Banking Sector in Viet Nam \n1.  Overview  \n5.  The banking sector in Viet Nam can be characterized as small in terms of total assets \n(currently estimated at $40 billion), fragmented, and highly populated. As highlighted in ADB\u2019s \ncountry strategy and program (CSP) (2007\u20132010), the financial sector is weak. Despite having \napproximately 80 banks, Viet Nam is dominated by five large SOCBs,10 and the historically poor \nperformance of these institutions has weakened the banking sector, although it is beginning to \nshow some signs of overall improvement. The banking sector is now more diversified and \nincludes joint-stock commercial banks (JSBs), foreign banks, and joint venture banks. There are \nalso two development and policy banks and about 50 foreign bank representative offices. The \nState Bank of Vietnam (SBV) acts as a central bank and supervisory institution, but is also a \nshareholder in the SOCBs. Basel I standards11 are currently in place and the SBV aims to \nimplement Basel II standards in 2010. However, several problem areas, such as successful \ncapitalization, equitization, and improvement in risk management of the SOCBs, remain to be \naddressed. Appendix 2 provides additional details on the banking sector in Viet Nam. \n \n6.  State-Owned Commercial Banks. The SOCBs control 75% of all banking assets in the \nmarket (footnote 6). The SOCBs were originally sectoral departments under the SBV with \nspecified lending programs (typically targeted to SOEs), which were often based on government \npolicies. Most of these banks have suffered from inadequate risk management and poor asset \nquality and, therefore, have posed a risk to Viet Nam\u2019s banking system and, more broadly, to \nthe  overall  economy.  Compounding  these  weaknesses  has  been  the  existence  of  poor \ndisclosure and weak accounting standards. While the Government maintained that NPLs were \nat about 4%, it is more likely that they were around 15% (footnote 6). Most SOCBs did not meet \ninternational  capital  requirement  standards,  as  the  Government  did  not  apply  international \nstandards, but rather set thresholds for the banks. The average capital adequacy ratio for \nSOCBs at the end of 2005 was 4.5%. With the exception of the Mekong Delta Housing Bank \nand the Vietnam Bank of Foreign Trade (Vietcombank), return on assets (ROA) for most of \nthese banks has been lower than international industry averages.  \n \n                                                 \n9   Economist Intelligence Unit. 2007. Country Report: Vietnam. London. \n10 Bank for Agricultural and Rural Development of Vietnam, Bank for Investment and Development of Vietnam, \nVietnam  Bank  for  Industry  and  Commerce,  Vietnam  Bank  of  Foreign  Trade,  and  Mekong  Delta  Housing \nDevelopment Bank. \n11 Basel I standards which established the minimum capital requirements for banks were issued in 1988 by the Bank \nfor International Settlements. Basel II standards, which are considered to be more comprehensive are in the \nprocess of being implemented by several countries. Vietnam has not yet implemented Basel II standards.  ", " \n7.  The performance of the SOCBs is starting to improve. Fitch Ratings recently upgraded \nthe four largest SOCBs to D/E from E.12  The upgrade reflects the banks\u2019 shift to more private-\nsector lending and an overall improvement in profitability. The operational improvement of these \nbanks is due in large part to changes undertaken in preparation for the equitization process. The \nGovernment plans to equitize all of the banks, with the exception of the Vietnam Bank for \nAgriculture and Rural Development, in 2007 and 2008. Vietcombank will be the pilot bank under \nthe equitization program. Banks have also embarked upon programs to reduce NPL levels and \nto raise capital adequacy ratios to levels required under Basel I standards and in accordance \nwith international accounting standards. In order for most of these banks to do so, it is estimated \nthat the Government will need to make cash infusions of about $4.3 billion (footnote 6). \n \n8.  Joint-Stock Banks. Unlike the SOCBs, a number of the JSBs have performed well and \nare quite profitable. The JSBs have achieved average returns on equity (ROEs) of between 15 \nand 30%, and NPLs are estimated to be substantially lower than those of the SOCBs. At less \nthan 15 years old the JSBs are young, and can be divided into three groups: (i) the top five large \nurban banks, (ii) a smaller group of about 19 banks that are either growing rapidly or have \nestablished a niche, and (iii) 12 small rural JSBs. The top five urban banks are Techcombank, \nSacombank, Vietnam International Bank, Asia Commercial Bank, and East Asia Commercial \nBank. The smaller urban JSB group consists of banks such as Habu Bank, Viet A Bank, and \nSaigon Bank. Most of the top five JSBs have large international strategic investors, such as \nHSBC, Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. (ANZ), and Standard Chartered. These \ninvestors  recognize  the  large  growth  potential  and  profitability  of  the  JSBs,  and  are  also \nassisting the JSBs meet capital adequacy ratio requirements. \n \n9.  Growth Opportunities. The potential for growth in the banking sector is high as banking \nservices are underutilized in Viet Nam. Penetration levels are quite low, with less than 5% of \nViet Nam\u2019s total population of 80 million using banking services on a regular basis, and less \nthan 20% having bank accounts (footnote 1). In order to capitalize on the high growth potential \nand to prepare for a more competitive environment, banks must (i) expand their product lines, (ii) \nimplement  better  corporate  governance,  and  (iii)  increase  their  market  penetration.  These \nactions are particularly important for the JSBs, many of which are following a strategy of \nconcurrently  expanding  their  retail  banking  services  and  their  SME  lending.  In  general, \nconsolidations of the major banks are not expected in the short term because these banks have \ngreat opportunities to grow in this rapidly expanding market. However, in the medium to long \nterm, as foreign competition increases, the sector may experience increasing consolidation.  \n \n10.  The retail market in Viet Nam is in its nascent stages. Only 2 million individuals have \nautomatic teller machine (ATM) cards, and the ratio of cash payments to bank transfers is high \nat 22.8% (footnote 1). VinaCapital, a large investment banking and fund manager, projects \ngrowth rates of about 33% for bank accounts and around 31% for debit and credit cards \n(footnote 1). JSBs, in particular, have been limited in their ability to build multiple consumer-\nlending product lines such as mortgages, vehicle loans, and credit or debit cards. To modernize \nthe banking sector and provide the multitude of services demanded by the population (both now \nand increasingly in the future), banks need access to long-term funding now. As one investment \nbanker stated: \u201cFor the smarter banks, it\u2019s a case of retail or fail\u201d (footnote 1). \n \n \n \n                                                 \n12 Fitch Ratings. 2007.

Supply. Viet Nam\u2019s urban centers have been growing since the mid-1990s. As the \ncountry  has  shifted  to  a  market  economy  and  new  manufacturing  industries  have  been \nestablished near major cities, urbanization rates have steadily increased. Experts indicate that \nthe population of urban centers will grow at a rate of slightly over 1 million per year.13 At this rate, \nViet Nam  will have one of the highest population densities in Asia. However, despite the \ncountry\u2019s  current  economic  achievements,  residential  housing  in  urban  areas  remains \nunderdeveloped.  \n \n12.  Housing stock levels have lagged behind demand for a variety of reasons. The state-\nsubsidized housing system, followed by state-sponsored construction companies, did not have \naccess to a steady supply of funds to build residential housing in urban areas. As a result, \nresidential housing was constructed on a sporadic basis. A market-oriented model of housing \nconstruction began to evolve in the mid-1990s, as some privately owned businesses were \nallowed to produce a few houses. Most construction was funded through informal, nonbank \nprocesses, with capital coming from overseas remittances, savings accumulated by households, \nor from borrowings from friends, relatives, or families; bank loans were nonexistent. Thus, \nprivate housing construction was undertaken primarily by the wealthy classes.  \n \n13.  In the past few years, however, housing construction has diversified to include a wider \nvariety of market segments. Most developers have targeted the upper class and expatriate \nmarkets, but condominiums for middle-class families have been constructed within the last few \nyears. Many of the condominiums did not sell, and this was due to the unavailability of mortgage \nfinancing. Although the landscape for urban housing has diversified, the Government maintains \ncontrol of the overall pace of property developments in larger cities. The Government has \nindicated that large property developments must be developed in a comprehensive manner that \nincludes infrastructure such as schools and roads. There is an increased emphasis by the \nGovernment that housing construction needs to be further diversified to include lower and \nmiddle income classes.   \n \n14.  Viet Nam\u2019s accession into the WTO is expected to bolster the supply of urban housing \nfor a broader market segment. The Land Law of 2003, Law on Housing of 2005, Law on \nResidence  of  2006  and  the  Real  Estate  Trading  Law  of  January  2007  have  eased  the \nrestrictions on the market for developers. Foreign developers are no longer required to establish \na joint venture with local partners. The Real Estate Trading Law strengthens the property \nmarket by addressing such issues as illicit transactions and speculation, and this will contribute \nto a healthier market. Additional property developments are anticipated with the entrance of \nworld-class companies. Foreign developers have already started construction on a number of \nunits in the larger cities. Ayala Land from the Philippines and Keppel Land of Singapore have \nentered the market, as have developers from Korea, Japan, and Indonesia. The Government is \nhopeful that development costs will be dictated by a more competitive market, which will then \nbroaden access to different levels of housing for the middle and lower classes.  \n \n15.  Housing Demand. A number of sources indicate increased demand for urban housing. \nTable 1 provides the Government\u2019s estimates for housing demand in urban areas. Real estate \n                                                 \n13 ADB and Cities Alliance. 2006. Urbanization and Sustainability in Asia:  Case Studies of Good Practices.

", " \ndevelopers  project  that  demand  will  grow  at  a  rate  of  6\u20137%  per  year.14  In  some  cities, \nparticularly Hanoi, demand is estimated to continue to outpace supply (Figure 1). Several \nchanges in Viet Nam have led to an increase in the demand. As the economy has improved and \nincomes have increased, young professionals are seeking to move out of their family homes \nand purchase a condominium in urban areas or small houses outside of the major cities. \nAverage per capita income levels are growing steadily. In 2005, the average per capita income \nwas $636. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) projects that it will be $715 in 2006 and $793 \nin 2007. ADB\u2019s CSP (2007\u20132010) projects an average per capita income of $1,050\u20131,100 by \n2010. Real incomes are often difficult to measure in Viet Nam as typically there are multiple \nsources  of  income  for  a  family,  including  official  employment,  small-business  income,  and \noverseas remittances. Last year, Viet Nam had overseas remittances of over $4 billion.15\n \nTable 1: Projection of Housing Demand in Urban Areas in Viet Nam \nItem  2003  2005  2010 \nPopulation  21,700,000   22,936,000   29,200,000  \nHousing Area (square meters)   223,800,000   250,002,000   438,000,000  \nTotal Housing (units)  4,422,000   5,208,000   7,692,000  \n          Source: Housing Department, Ministry of Construction. \n \nFigure 1: Housing Supply vs. Actual Demand in Hanoi \n30,000\ns 20,000\nt\nni\nu\ng \nn\nsi\nu\no\nH 10,000\n0\n2006 2007 2008 2009 2010\nYear\nActual demand for housing Supply (housing units)\n \n                Source: CB Richard Ellis, Vietnam. \n \n16.  Housing Prices. Housing prices in urban areas of Viet Nam have increased in the past \n2\u20133  years.  Price  escalation  has  been  primarily  due  to  demand  exceeding  supply  and  to \nspeculation. Given the very limited size of the stock market, investors have perceived property \ninvestments as safe and easy. As supply grows and the number of companies and financial \ninstitutions on the stock market increases with the forthcoming equitizations, it is anticipated that \nproperty prices will stabilize in certain market segments. High-end property prices are currently \nstable and are expected to increase somewhat more in some urban areas. However, prices for \n                                                 \n14 CB Richard Ellis, Vietnam. \n15 Investment and Trade Promotion Centre, Ho Chi Minh City.

Mortgage Lending \n17.  At the core of the development of these large urban areas is access to adequate and \naffordable housing, and this is facilitated by (i) a healthy property market with adequate supply \nand rational pricing, and (ii) long-term mortgage financing. As discussed, housing supply is \nstarting to grow in Viet Nam and property prices in the middle to low-end segments have started \nto stabilize and are now decreasing. Viet Nam, however, has a limited mortgage finance market. \nVarious sources have estimated that mortgages account for only 3% of the total outstanding \nloans in the banking sector.17\n \n18.  The market has been constrained for a number of reasons. Affordability has been a \nmajor issue, and there is very limited long-term financing available to the banks. Thus, although \nthe banks noted above indicate that they will lend on longer terms, typically they will not due to a \nlack of long-term funding. Therefore, tenors on mortgage loans typically range from 3 to 5 years. \nGiven that monthly payments increase as the tenor of the loan decreases, mortgages have not \nbeen an option for most people (Appendix 3 gives an example of the impact of longer-term \nmortgages on monthly payments). Mortgage lending has also been limited because of the legal \nand regulatory framework surrounding this market.  \n \n19.  The regulatory and legal framework for mortgage lending has improved substantially \nover the last year. In the past both ADB and the International Finance Corporation (IFC) have \nprovided  technical  assistance  to  the  Government  pertaining  to  the  legal  and  regulatory \nframework  for  mortgage  lending.  In  July  2006,  the  Government  introduced  a  new  law  on \nhousing, the first to put forward a more comprehensive legal framework for ownership, lease, \nuse, and management of houses, including apartments, by local and foreign individuals and \norganizations. In December 2006, the Government published implementing regulations that \nclarified some outstanding issues pertaining to the housing market. The Ministry of Natural \nResources and Environment (MONRE) has standardized and shortened procedures for land \nuse rights certificates (LURC) issuance. MONRE has also established the Land Title Office \nunder the Department of Natural Resources and Environment to deal with LUCR issuance, \ntransfer of land use rights, and secured transaction registration related to land use rights. The \nGovernment has also taken measures to improve the property registration system, setting a \ntarget of having all properties registered by the end of 2007. In January 2007, the prime minister \napproved a large project to upgrade the registration system by the creation of a database that \nwill be accessed by banks and will contain all registered properties. The project is planned to be \nfully implemented within 2 years. With respect to foreclosing property, nonjudicial and judicial \nforeclosure is permitted under Vietnamese law. Nonjudicial foreclosure can be pursued if this \nconcept is included in the mortgage contract; it can take 1 to 3 years to complete the foreclosure \nthrough the judicial process. Appendix 4 has additional information on the legal and regulatory \nframework for housing finance in Viet Nam. \n \n \n \n                                                 \n16 Colliers International Vietnam. 2007.

THE BORROWER \nA.  Background \n20.  Techcombank was registered as a JSB in 1993. It is currently the ninth largest bank in \nViet Nam and the fourth largest JSB as measured by its assets and shareholder equity.18  The \nbank was established to become an efficient private sector financial intermediary between \nsavers and businesses in need of capital in the era of market liberalization in Viet Nam.  \n \n21.  Techcombank currently offers a wide range of traditional banking services, including (i) \nmobilizing and receiving short-term, medium-term, and long-term capital from companies and \nindividuals; (ii) lending short-term, medium-term, and long-term capital to organizations and \nindividuals; (iii) conducting foreign currency transactions; (iv) providing transaction services \nbetween customers; and (v) other banking services as approved by the SBV. The milestones of \nTechcombank\u2019s development since 1993 are described in Appendix 5.  \n \nB.  Credit Rating \n22.  In September 2006, Techcombank became the first JSB in Viet Nam to obtain credit \nratings from Moody\u2019s rating agency. The bank received a Ba2 for long- and short-term foreign \ncurrency issuer ratings, Ba1 for long- and short-term local currency issuer ratings, and a Bank \nFinancial Strength Rating (BFSR) of D\u2013. The outlook for all the deposit and issuer ratings is \nassessed \u201cstable\u201d and the outlook for the BFSR is rated \u201cpositive\u201d.  \n \nC.  Business Overview and Strategy \n23.  Techcombank\u2019s  primary  business consists  of retail  and  corporate  banking.  Its  retail \nbanking activities include lending and deposit taking, as well as providing payment cards, \nconsumer loans, and mortgages. Its corporate banking division provides a broad range of \nbanking products to a diversified group of domestic customers, primarily SMEs. The bank is \nalso an active participant in the fixed income securities and foreign currency markets in Viet \nNam.  \n \n1.  Business Lines \na.  Retail Banking \n24.  Focused Products. Retail banking is a core business of Techcombank. Historically it \nhas been a small portion of the bank\u2019s business but it is now becoming the bank\u2019s dominant \nproduct line. The bank\u2019s strategy for retail banking is to provide a full range of products and \nservices to meet the particular needs of the customers at various stages in their life. These \nservices include demand deposit accounts, savings, loans, payments, credit and debit cards, \ninvestments, guarantees, and safe custody facilities.  \n \n25.  Expansion in Retail Business. Retail business is the bank\u2019s key growth segment and it \nintends to further increase retail loans as a proportion of its total loan book. Techcombank\u2019s \nretail business is expanding rapidly as it benefits from fast economic growth and the ensuing \nincrease in per-capita income and changing consumer habits. By the end of 2006, the bank \nserved individual clients at 73 locations in 15 cities and provinces nationwide.  \n                                                 \n18 VinaCaptial. 2006.

Mortgage Lending. Mortgage lending at Techcombank has been growing, but is still \nsmall as an overall percentage of its lending activities when compared with banks in more \ndeveloped markets. The bank has been limited by a lack of long-term funds. With access to \nlonger-term financing, Techcombank estimates that it can double its mortgage portfolio by the \nend of 2007. The bank had approximately 4,500 mortgage loans with an average size of \n$26,000 at the end of 2006, and the age of its mortgage portfolio is quite young (about 5 years \nold). The maximum loan-to-value ratio (LTV) at which the bank currently lends is 70%, with the \naverage being somewhat lower. Techcombank can offer 15-year loans, but the average tenor is \ngenerally about 5 years, and loans primarily have a floating rate basis. The bank has been able \nto successfully foreclose a property. \n \n27.  Techcombank has developed several products aimed specifically at market segments, \nincluding (i) the New Home program aimed at the middle and upper classes, (ii) the Young \nFamily  program  which  targets  young  professionals  at  medium  income  levels,  and  (iii)  the \nAffordable Housing program which focuses on lower income groups. The Affordable Housing \nprogram is supported, in part, by ADB\u2019s public sector Housing Finance Project Loan 1990. \nTechcombank is in the process of developing mortgage products with a tenor of 20 years that \nwill serve to broaden its penetration in this market and provide more affordable housing.  \n \nb.  Corporate Banking \n28.  Techcombank\u2019s corporate and commercial banking business includes deposit taking, \nbusiness loans with a focus on SMEs, international settlements, and trade finance. Although the \nnumber of business clients increased by over 30% in 2006, and lending to them increased by \nmore than 50% over the previous year, Techcombank\u2019s key growth area is retail banking. \n \n2.  Trade Finance and Remittances \n29.  Trade Finance. Techcombank has the largest trade finance market share amongst all \nJSBs in Viet Nam, and has a network of relationships with over 400 banks in over 100 countries \nworldwide. Techcombank\u2019s network is particularly well positioned in the People\u2019s Republic of \nChina, Japan, and the Republic of Korea, which are important markets for Vietnamese SMEs.  ", " \n \n30.  ADB has a trade finance facility valued at $6 million in place with Techcombank, and \ndisbursed from it to Techcombank twice in 2005. Each disbursement was valued at $3 million \ncarrying a tenor of 6 months, and both loans were repaid on time. ADB is in the process of \ndisbursing another $3 million under the facility. \n \n31.  Remittances. Techcombank is also active in providing remittance services. The bank \nplans to increase its remittance business by creating more links with remittance companies in \nthe Middle East and South America. \n \nIV.  THE PROPOSED LOAN \nA.  ADB Loan \n32.  The loan may be funded in dong or US dollars in an amount of up to $25 million. Dong \nfunding may be made available through a cross-currency swap, subject to all relevant approvals \nhaving been obtained. ADB\u2019s Treasury Department has received verbal indications from the \nGovernment that the cross-currency swap will be approved. \n \nB.  Main Terms and Conditions \n  1.  The loan will be sourced from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources and the interest \nrate will be determined by ADB\u2019s Pricing and Credit Enhancement Committee. If ADB is unable \nto provide funding in local currency, the loan will be offered in US dollars. The committee will \nalso determine the up-front and commitment fees. Subject to further advice from Vietnamese \ncounsel, the loan may be secured through a pledge of the underlying mortgage loan receivables \nfunded with ADB\u2019s loan. \n \nV.  INVESTMENT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \nA.  Justification \n1.  Development Outcome \n33.  The proposed ADB assistance will promote the following development. \n \n(i)  Strengthening the banking sector. As discussed, the banking sector in Viet \nNam is weak and has been targeted as a priority sector for ADB support. The \nproposed ADB assistance will be an integral part of the strategy for strengthening \nViet Nam\u2019s banking sector through the support of a dynamic and well-managed \nJSB.  Banking  sectors  greatly  benefit  from  the  ability  to  undertake  mortgage \nfinancing. Long-term mortgages can reduce funding and liquidity risks in banks. \nMortgage  financing  also  encourages  the  growth  and  diversification  of  the \nfinancial services sector, which many studies have shown to be a key factor in \neconomic development. Mortgages are often a bank\u2019s highest quality asset, as \ndefault rates are typically lower than other asset classes; people are less likely to \ndefault  on  their  mortgage  than  on  a  car  loan  or  a  credit  card  debt.  When \naffordable  housing  can  be  accessed,  consumers  begin  to  save  for  down-\npayments  and  loan  repayments.  These  actions  increase  both  the  assets \navailable to the financial services sector and the demand for more financial \nservices.  The  introduction  or  expansion  of  private-sector  mortgage  lending \n ", "10       \nstrengthens a country\u2019s financial sector through the addition of new banking \nproducts  and  services  and  the  diversification  of  risks  across  a  broadened \nportfolio. \n \n(ii)  Meet demand for urban housing and support the development of a primary \nmortgage market. As discussed, demand for housing in urban areas has grown \nconcurrently with the improvement of the economy and the subsequent increase \nin income levels. Access to housing has been impeded due to a very small \nformal mortgage market. Through ADB\u2019s proposed loan to Techcombank, the \nurban population will have broader access to housing through mortgage lending. \nLong-term funding in local currency provided by ADB will enable Techcombank \nto  increase  the  tenor  of  its  mortgage  loans,  which  will  decrease  monthly \npayments and therefore result in improved affordability. Additionally, as banks \ngain experience in the mortgage product and credit assessment of individual \nborrowers, they will be better able to offer mortgage products to good quality \nborrowers in wider income brackets.  \n \n(iii)  Job creation and revenue generation. The development of a primary mortgage \nmarket is essential for a country\u2019s socioeconomic growth. At its most basic level, \nmortgage  financing  provides  access  to  shelter  or  improvements  to  existing \nhousing. The creation of a primary mortgage market can significantly contribute \nto job creation and revenue generation in a country. Strong backward linkages \nare  often  found  within  economies  through  primary  mortgage  markets. \nEmployment related to the construction and home improvement industries is \nsupported and jobs in the real estate sector, such as with appraisal companies \nand land titling or registration services, are created. The purchase of consumer \ngoods also increases, particularly as a family begins to furnish its first home with \nnew  appliances  and  furniture.  It  is  estimated  that  approximately  15%  of  a \ncountry\u2019s total workforce can be generated by mortgage financing.19 With respect \nto forward links, mortgage lending can serve as a vehicle by creating one of the \nmost important sources of capital for an individual or family. Capital for the \nestablishment of SMEs can be accessed through a mortgaged property. Finally, \ngovernments benefit from taxation on the properties and businesses.  \n \n(iv)  Catalyzing  capital  markets.  Broadening  and  deepening  a  country\u2019s  capital \nmarkets is important to its overall economic development. The creation of a \nsecondary mortgage market can catalyze capital-market development. However, \na well-functioning secondary mortgage market cannot be developed without a \nstrong primary mortgage market. A primary mortgage market must be able to \nproduce a large volume of good quality mortgages that have been originated \naccording  to  standardized  documentation.  In  order  to  produce  good  quality \nmortgages,  solid  and  consistent  underwriting  must  be  undertaken  by  banks. \nOnce the mortgages have been originated, servicing of the loans and tracking of \nperformance must be undertaken. All of these functions contribute to an efficient \nsecondary mortgage market. Support of the establishment of a strong primary \nmortgage market will hasten the pace of capital-market development.  \n \n \n \n                                                 \n19 The Netherlands Development Finance Company website.  http://www.fmo.nl/en/recent/newsitem.php?id=99  ", " \n2.  Investment Objectives \n34.  ADB\u2019s objectives for the proposed loan are (i) to increase the availability of long-term \nmortgage financing, thereby contributing to the provision of more affordable housing; and (ii) to \nstrengthen the financial sector by enabling a strong JSB to increase its activities in the retail \nbanking sector.  \n \n3.  Project Outcome \n35.  The expected outcome of the proposed loan is that Techcombank will be able to provide \nincreased access to long-term mortgage loans to individuals in Viet Nam. \n \n4.  Value Added by ADB \n36.  The proposed loan will enable Techcombank to meet its core objective of building a \nmortgage loan portfolio, while contributing to the overall growth of its retail business. The long-\nterm financing that ADB will provide is critical for the growth of the mortgage business in Viet \nNam. Long-term financing is needed to enable the bank to lend on longer terms, which will \nimprove the affordability of mortgages for consumers. ADB will require Techcombank to adhere \nto internationally prudent LTV ratios, which will ensure good credit underwriting standards and \nreduce  systematic  risks  in  the  market. 20   In  addition,  Techcombank\u2019s  portfolio  will  be \nstrengthened by the addition of high-quality assets. More broadly, ADB will build upon its current \nrelationship with Techcombank, and in doing so, will encourage the adoption of better practices \nand  anti-money  laundering,  anti-corruption,  and  environmental  safeguard  policies  and \nprocedures. \n \n5.  Design and Monitoring Framework \n37.  ADB has prepared a design and monitoring framework and will measure the expected \ndevelopment impact of the loan in accordance with ADB\u2019s Management Development Results \nPolicy.21 (The design and monitoring framework appears in Appendix 15). \n \nB.  Social and Environmental Safeguard Policies \n38.  The loan has been assigned a category FI environmental classification and is classified \nas category C with respect to ADB\u2019s Policy on Indigenous Peoples (1998) and Involuntary \nResettlement Policy (1995). Techcombank has procedures in place to identify environmental \nrisks as required by the trade finance agreement with ADB. Techcombank will be required to \nmaintain an environmental management system following the guidelines in Appendix 16 and to \nbuild capacity for implementing it. At least one Techcombank officer will attend ADB-sponsored \nenvironmental management training.  \n \n \n                                                 \n20 Higher LTV-ratio loans result in a higher frequency of default and a higher severity of loss as evidenced by \ninternational data. A study published by Housing Finance International shows that default probabilities increase \nmore rapidly for LTV ratios over 80%. The default probabilities were found to be 2.2% for LTVs below 40%, 2.8% \nfor LTVs of 40\u201350%, 3.3% for LTVs of 50\u201360%, 3.7% for LTVs of 60\u201365%, 4.3% for LTV of 65\u201370%, 4.9% for \nLTVs of 70\u201375%, 6.0% for LTVs of 75\u201380%, 7.0% for LTVs of 80\u201385%, and 8.7% for LTVs of 85\u201390%.

Anticorruption  Policy:  Combating  Money  Laundering  and  the  Financing  of \nTerrorism \n39.  ADB has undertaken due diligence on Techcombank\u2019s procedures in respect of money \nlaundering and financing of terrorism. Techcombank was advised of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy \n(1998, as amended to date) and policy relating to Combating of Money Laundering and the \nFinancing  of  Terrorism  (2003). 22   Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance, \naccountability, and transparency, ADB will require Techcombank to institute, maintain, and \ncomply with internal procedures and controls following international best practice standards for \nthe purpose of preventing corruption or money laundering activities or the financing of terrorism \nin  the  reimbursement  and  indemnity  agreements.  Further,  Techcombank  will  undertake  to \nrefrain from engaging in such activities. The documentation between ADB and Techcombank \nwill further allow ADB to investigate any violation or potential violation of these undertakings.  \n \nVI.  ASSURANCES \n40.  ADB will enter into suitable finance documentation following approval of the proposed \nfinancing by ADB\u2019s Board of Directors, on terms and conditions satisfactory to ADB. \n \n41.  Consistent  with  the  Agreement  Establishing  the  Asian  Development  Bank,  the \nGovernment of Viet Nam will be requested to confirm that it has no objection to the proposed \nloan to Techcombank. The loan will not be disbursed until ADB receives such confirmation. \n \nVII.  RECOMMENDATION \n42.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  acting  in  the  absence  of  the  President,  under  the \nprovisions of Article 35.1 of the Article of Agreement of ADB, I recommend that the Board \napprove the loan of up to $25,000,000 (to be funded in local currency or US dollars) to Vietnam \nTechnological and Commercial Joint-stock Bank (Techcombank) from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources, with interest to be determined based on the procedures applicable to nonsovereign \nloans and such other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set \nforth in this report and as may be reported to the Board. \n \n \n                  Liqun Jin \n                  Vice President \n \n16 August 2007 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n22 ADB. 2003.

Economic Outlook \n \n1.  Viet Nam has made significant gains in improving its economy and alleviating poverty. It \nwas the second fastest growing economy in Asia with gross domestic product (GDP) growth \nrates between 7.0% and almost 8.5% during the period from 2003 to June 2006,1 and it is \nexpected to be about 8.2% for 2006.2  \n \n2.  Gross Domestic Product. The country\u2019s five-year plan for 2006\u20132010 targets GDP \ngrowth at 7.5\u20138.0%. Viet Nam benefits from a number of factors that are likely to sustain a high \ngrowth rate. The country has a rapidly growing workforce, with more than half of the workforce \nunder 25 years old and about 30% of the population under 15 years old. Literacy rates of the \nworkforce are high at 93%,3  and there are strong opportunities for growth in the manufacturing \nsector on this basis; Canon and Intel corporations have stated that they will be establishing \nplants in Viet Nam. Another growth factor is that individual savings rates are high. In 1990, the \nsavings rate was about 5%; by 2005 it had increased to 36%.4 High savings levels have \nparalleled the growth in investment rates. Additionally, the macroeconomic policy framework is \nsupportive of continued high growth rates. \n  \n3.  Fiscal Performance. In the period from 2001 to 2006, the budget balance improved. Oil \nrevenues contributed strongly to the growth of revenues, comprising 8\u201310% of GDP, which is \nabout 33% of total government revenues (footnote 4). Also contributing to revenue growth has \nbeen the expansion of the tax base and improved tax administration. However, to further \nstrengthen the current tax base, the tax system will need to be expanded to individuals and \nprivate enterprises, as the Government has traditionally relied upon taxes from state-owned \nenterprises (SOEs). While the Government\u2019s fiscal performance is strong and revenues are \nprojected to remain at healthy levels, there will be some pressure in the next few years. One of \nthe  primary  Government  expenditures  will  be  for  infrastructure  development.  Capital \nexpenditures are currently equal to about 8\u201310% of GDP. If oil prices were to weaken, the \nbudget could be under further pressure given the intention to improve infrastructure. Other \npressures on the Government\u2019s fiscal performance include the expected rise in the minimum \nwages in the public sector to an equivalent of the base for the private sector by 2010. Therefore, \nthe government deficit is expected to increase in 2007 and 2008. The deficit was 1.2% of GDP \nin 2006, and is projected to increase to 2.3% in 2007 and to 2.5% in 2008, and remain at \napproximately that level until 2011.5\n \n4.  The reported fiscal performance of the Government must be taken in context with the \nGovernment\u2019s  unreported  expenditures.  The  prime  minister  has  the  authority  to  approve \nexpenditures that are not part of the budget and are part of the Socio Economic Development \nPlan. The funds are disbursed through the Vietnam Development Bank (VDB) and are typically \nused for infrastructure financing. These funds are generally provided by official development \nagencies. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) estimates that with off-budget activities, the \nfiscal deficit for 2005 was 5.9% of GDP compared to the 1.2% as reported by the Government. \nThe Government has made efforts to limit off-budget spending. In December 2006, a decree \n                                                 \n1 Biallas, Margarete, and Hanh Nam Nguyen. 2006. Vietnam: Financial Sector Diagnostic.

If  this \norganizational  change  is  implemented,  VDB\u2019s  debt  will  no  longer  be  guaranteed  by  the \nGovernment. \n \n5.  Monetary  Developments.  Decision  112  that  was  issued  in  May  2006  by  the \nVietnamese Government was formulated to convert the State Bank of Vietnam (SBV) into a fully \nindependent  central  bank  responsible  for  monetary  policy  and  supervision  of  financial \ninstitutions. The SBV will divest its shareholdings in the state-owned commercial banks (SOCBs) \nand will have a mandate to (i) protect the value of the currency, (ii) control inflation, (iii) ensure \nthe safety of the monetary and banking system, and (iv) create a favorable macroeconomic \nenvironment for growth and development. The SBV is expected to maintain a careful, but \nflexible, monetary policy direction, with the main policy target being to keep the annual inflation \nrate below 7%.  \n \n6.  External  Developments.  At about 37% of GDP for 2005, current government debt \nlevels are low.6 The majority of the country\u2019s debt consists of low interest rate loans from official \ndonor agencies. The IMF anticipates that debt will increase gradually over the medium term and \npeak by 2009 at 42.5% of GDP. The increase will be primarily due to state-sector restructuring. \nThe  IMF  has  also  highlighted  banking  sector  contingent  liabilities  as  an  area  of  concern. \nNonperforming loans (NPLs) are estimated at about 15% of GDP. Viet Nam\u2019s vulnerability to \nexternal shocks that would impact debt repayments is low, given that most debt is from official \ndonor agencies. Overall vulnerability to external shock is mitigated by a current account that has \nremained in surplus due to high levels of remittances, foreign direct investment (FDI), and \ngrowing tourism receipts. As a result, foreign exchange reserves were $9.2 billion at the end of \n2005.7\n \n7.  Continued growth is dependent upon successful execution of a number of planned \ngovernment reforms. The Government has committed to transitioning to a market economy \nwithin the next 5 years. Its strategy is based on the equitization of state-owned enterprises \n(SOEs)  and  SOCBs.  Additionally,  the  Government  has  targeted  the  strengthening  of  the \nbroader banking sector (including joint-stock banks), the development of private capital markets, \nand infrastructure-related investments, as critical to this transition. Accession to the World Trade \nOrganization (WTO) in January 2007 marked decades of economic transformation for Viet Nam, \nand it is likely that WTO membership will stimulate more growth. Reforms undertaken for the \nprocess of the country\u2019s accession to the WTO will not be reversed. While there is a risk that \nimplementation of these reforms could be slow, the current political environment is supportive of \nthem.  \n \n8.  Exchange Rate. The Government strictly regulates the dong. Since January 2007 with \nthe country\u2019s accession to the WTO, the SBV has widened the daily fluctuation limits of the \ndong against the US dollar from plus or minus 0.25% to plus or minus 0.5% in order to maintain \na more flexible exchange rate policy. The dong has been depreciating marginally against the US \ndollar to maintain competitiveness in the export sector. With the recent increase of portfolio \ninvestment capital inflows into the financial market, the dong is starting to appreciate.  \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n6   Moody\u2019s ratings agency. \n7   International Monetary Fund (IMF). ", "    Appendix 1  15\nB.  Political Outlook \n \n9.  The Communist Party of Vietnam (CPV), led by Party General Secretary Nong Duc \nManh, is the leading entity, with power over state and societal matters in Viet Nam. Party \nGeneral Secretary Nong Duc Manh was reelected in April 2006, which is a positive indication for \ncontinued reforms. He is considered to be quite supportive of reforms within the country and as \none of his primary goals has targeted 2020 as the year by  which Viet Nam  will become \nindustrialized.  Within  the  CPV  there  is  some  moderate  internal  division  between  more \nconservative  members,  who  have  been  ambivalent  to  economic  liberalization,  and  reform-\nminded individuals. However, with the appointment of Nong Duc Manh as general secretary, it is \nunlikely that conservative elements will emerge with more strength. The CPV has a strong \npresence within the Quoc-Hoi (the National Assembly), comprising 90% of the current assembly.  \n \n10.  President Nguyen Minh Triet is head of state and he appointed Prime Minister Nguyen \nTan Dung, who is considered to be an economic reformer. He was previously head of the SBV \nand then deputy prime minister. President Triet has a history of combating corruption and has \nincreasingly emphasized this issue within the Government. There has been some moderate \nshift in the overlap between the CPV and the Government, with the top three state leaders no \nlonger  attending  Politburo  meetings.  In  practice,  daily  leadership  of  the  country  is  shared \nbetween the general secretary of the CPV, the prime minister, and the president.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "16  Appendix 2 \nLOAN AFFORDABILITY ANALYSIS \n \nTable A2.1: Detail of Sample Housing Loan  \n($ equivalent) \n \nItem  Number \nPrincipal  24,500 a\nInterest rate  11.9% b\nMonths  12 \na   Loan is based on 70% loan-to-value ratio of 50 square meters at \n$700 per square meter (price of mid-income condominium in Ho \nChi Minh City). \nb   Interest rate is based on 1 year deposit (9.4% per annum) and a \nspread of 2.5% per annum. \nSource:  Asian Development Bank project team analysis based on \ndata provided by Colliers International. \n \nTable A2.2: Affordability Analysis for a Term of 5 Years  \n($ equivalent) \n           \nYear  Principal Repayment  Balance at  Interest  Total  Payment Per \nYear-End  Payment  Payment  Month \n1      4,900       25,000   2,975   7,875     656  \n2      4,900   20,100   2,392   7,292   608  \n3      4,900   15,200   1,809    6,709   559  \n4   4,900      10,300   1,226    6,126   510  \n5  4,900   5,400     643   5,543   462  \nTotal  24,500     33,544     \n Average Monthly Payment     559  \nSource:  Asian Development Bank project team analysis based on data provided by Colliers International. \n           \nTable A2.3: Affordability Analysis for a Term of 10 Years \n($ equivalent) \n           \nYear  Principal Repayment  Balance at  Interest  Total  Payment Per \nYear-End  Payment  Payment  Month \n1  2,450       25,000   2,975   5,425   452 \n2  2,450   22,550   2,683    5,133   428 \n3  2,450    20,100   2,392     4,842   403 \n4  2,450   17,650   2,100     4,550   379 \n5  2,450   15,200   1,809     4,259   355 \n6  2,450   12,750   1,517       3,967   331 \n     \n7  2,450   10,300   1,226    3,676   306 \n8    2,450   7,850   934         3,384   282 \n       \n9      2,450   5,400   643         3,093   258 \n       \n10  2,450   2,950   351        2,801   233 \nTotal  24,500     41,130     \n Average Monthly Payment    343 \nSource:  Asian Development Bank project team analysis based on data provided by Colliers International.

The regulatory and legal framework in Viet Nam for mortgage lending has improved \nsubstantially in the last few years. In December 2003, the Government introduced the Land Law \nand Decree 181/2004 (the Land Law). The National Assembly also passed the Housing Law in \nNovember 2005, which became effective in July 2006. The Housing Law sets out a more \ncomprehensive  legal  framework  for  ownership,  lease,  use,  and  management  of  houses \n(including apartments) by local and foreign individuals and organizations. In December 2006, \nthe  Government  published  implementing  regulations  (Decree  95)  that  clarified  the  housing \ncertificate registration and ownership right of building.  \n \n2.  Land Use Rights. Property in Viet Nam is designated as either freehold or leasehold. \nLeasehold property belongs to various branches of the Government and commercial entities. \nDue to historical reasons, government agencies and state-owned enterprises (SOEs) occupy a \nsignificant amount of land; private-sector access to land for both commercial and residential use \nis somewhat limited. Freehold property, on the other hand, belongs to the people. In order to \nbuild a house or to buy an existing house, an individual must obtain a land use right certificate \n(LURC). The Land Law provides the legal framework for registration and issuance of LURCs. \nUnder the Land Law, the land management agency (referred as to the Land Registration Office) \nis responsible for processing and issuance of LURCs. The Land Registration Office is organized \nvertically from the central to the grassroots levels to facilitate a national uniform land use right \nregistration system.  \n \n3.  First time issuance of LURCs is important for the development of the formal property and \nmortgage  finance  market.  Some  statistics  indicate  that  less  than  50%  of  land  has  been \nregistered in larger urban cities. In the past, the issuance process for first time LURCs was \ninefficient and lengthy. The Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment (MONRE) has \nstandardized and shortened procedures for LURC issuance, and has established the Land Title \nOffice under the Department of Natural Resources and Environment to manage the LURC \nprocess, transfer of land use rights, and secured transaction registration related to land use right. \nThe new LURC process eliminates some previously needed steps, such as securing approvals \nfrom the chairman of the People\u2019s Committee. Figure A4 shows the steps for LURC issuance. \n \n \nFigure A3: Operational Process in the Land Transportation Office \n \nCustomer Service \nProcessing  LURC  Application  and \nInquiries \n(cid:131) Preparation of Cadastral Records  \nLand Registration \n(cid:131) Registering and Verification of LURC \n(cid:131) Extracting Cadastral Maps and Documents \n(cid:131) Endorsing Changes on LURCs \n(cid:131) Sending Cadastral Data to Tax Authority  \n(cid:131) Submission to DONRE for signing the LURCs \n(cid:131) Granting the signed LURCs \n(cid:131) Updating the Cadstral Records in the Land \nInformation System \n \nDONRE = Department of Natural Resources and Environment, LURC = Land Use Rights,  ", "  Appendix 3  19\n4.  Mortgage Registration. The fundamental laws governing the mortgaging of land use \nrights and buildings including houses and other immovable structures fixed to land are set forth \nin the 2005 Land Law and the Civil Code. These provisions are further defined in the Decree \n163, circulars 05 and 03 on secured transactions. Under the current regulations, the Land \nRegistration Office is responsible for registration of secured transactions related to land, any \nexisting assets on land, and any assets on land to be formed. \n \n5.  Improvements have been introduced to the mortgage registration process, and these \nhave shortened the time taken for registration. Within 5 days of signing a mortgage contract, the \nmortgage must be registered by either the mortgagor or mortgagee. The dossier submitted to \nthe Land Registration Office at the district level includes (i) an application form for mortgage \nregistration, (ii) an LURC, (iii) a right certificate of the building on land, and (iv) a building \nconstruction permit. The timeline for the Land Registration Office to complete the mortgage \nregistration has been shortened from 5 days (Circular 05 dated 16 June 2005) to one working \nday (Circular 03 as of 13 June 2006). The fee for mortgage registration is D50,000 (over $3). \nThe Land Registration Office also has to send a monthly report on all registered mortgage \ntransactions  to  the  Secure  Transaction  Registry  Agency  under  the  Ministry  of  Justice  for \nconsolidation.  \n \n6.  A great number of real estate transactions were conducted informally in the past. In an \neffort to improve the property registration system, in January 2007 the Government approved a \n$50 million project to modernize the land administration system. It has set a target of having all \nresidential properties registered by the end of 2007. A database is expected to be established to \nstore  both  land  registration  and  mortgage  registration  information,  and  this  will  then  be \naccessed by commercial banks. In future, when an individual applies for a mortgage, the bank \nwill be able to immediately access the land registry. The project is expected to be funded by the \nWorld Bank and the Government of Sweden.  \n \n7.  Another requirement of the mortgage registration process is notarization. Notaries must \ncertify the validity and legality of each mortgage contract. Most notaries are reluctant to sign \nbank forms and would rather use their own standard forms. This requirement complicates and \nlengthens the process of mortgage registration.  \n \n8.  Foreclosure. In the past asset foreclosure in Viet Nam was regulated by the Inter-\nministerial Circular 03/2001 on Handling the Loan Security Asset to Recover Debts of Credit \nInstitutions. The circular outlined the instructions to local authorities and the police on how and \nin what circumstances they should proceed to recover mortgaged property. It also required a \nmortgagee  to  obtain  the  permission  of  the  relevant  people\u2019s  committee  before  auctioning \nproperty. This law was considered to be unclear and cumbersome by those undertaking the \nforeclosure process.  \n \n9.  Asset foreclosure laws have also been recently strengthened. However, overlapping \nlaws  still  govern  the  process  and  there  remain  some  vague  areas  that  could  be  further \nimproved.  In  2006,  the  Government  introduced  Decree  163  on  secured  transactions.  In \nconjunction  with  the  Land  Law,  Decree  163  implements  the  new  framework  for  secured \ntransactions that was introduced by the Civil Code and is considered to improve and clarify \nprevious  regulations  governing  foreclosure.  Both  judicial  and  nonjudicial  foreclosures  are \ncurrently allowed. Both methods of foreclosure have recourse through the laws for seizure of \nproperty with police action if there is resistance. \n \n \n ", "20  Appendix 3 \n10.  In order to pursue the more preferable nonjudicial foreclosure process, the steps to \nforeclosure must be agreed upon and contained in the mortgage contract. Options for property \ndisposal  must  also  be  included  in  the  contract.  Decree  163  gives  some  guidance  on  the \nmethods by which the property can be disposed of. Some of these options include (i) a sale with \nthe proceeds being remitted to the lender, (ii) outright ownership of the property, and (iii) receipt \nof another property of equivalent market value. Auctions can also be undertaken as a method \nfor property disposal. It is important to note that both private and state auctions can be used in \nthe foreclosure process; state auctions will often yield lower prices on the property. \n \n11.  When  there  is  no  agreement  on  foreclosure in  the  mortgage  contract,  Decree 163 \noutlines the various steps for judicial foreclosure. If the case is brought to the court, it can take \nmuch more time for the issuing and implementing of the court decision, given the unclear \nsummary judgment procedure and the poor effectiveness of the judicial police responsible for \nimplementation of the court system. Judicial foreclosure has been tested to a limited extent with \nsuccessful outcomes. \n ", "  Appendix 16 21 \n \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance  Data Sources/Reporting  Assumptions \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Mechanisms  and Risks \nImpact      Assumptions \nThe  urban  population  Increase  of  formal  CB Richard Ellis statistics.  \u2022  Increased access to \nhas broader access to  housing  for  middle-   mortgage finance from \nhousing in large urban  income  families  in  Collier  International  banks will lead to more \nareas in Viet Nam.    major  urban  areas,  statistics.  individuals receiving \n  predominately  Hanoi    mortgage loans and \nUnlock  \u201cdead  capital\u201d  and Ho Chi Minh City.
