PNG\u2019s long-term transport development goals are encapsulated in the \n3. \ncountry\u2019s  National  Strategic  Plan  (Vision  2050)  as  an  economic  development  framework. 1 \nVision 2050 identified the development of human capital and wealth creation as the country\u2019s top \npriorities,  with  the  expansion  of  transport  services  underscoring  all  these  goals.  The  PNG \nDevelopment Strategic Plan, 2010\u20132030 aims to increase the country\u2019s share of national roads \nin good condition from 33% in 2010 to 100% by 2030, in addition to tripling the network length to \n25,000 kilometers (km).2 This strategy recognizes the northern region road corridor as one of the \nmost critical economic corridors in PNG. Improving the corridor is also in line with the National \nTransport  Strategy,  2014\u20132030,  which  is  the  government\u2019s  road  map  for  transport  sector \ndevelopment.3 The Medium Term Development Plan III, 2018\u20132022 serves as the national policy \nframework to deliver the key development outcomes, with a rolling 5-year investment plan.4 The \nnorthern region corridor program is identified as a priority investment also in both the Medium-\nTerm Development Plan III and the National Road Network Strategy, 2018\u20132037.5 \n \n4. \nImprovement  needs.  The  northern  region  road  corridor  starts  at  the  Indonesian\u2013PNG \nborder at Wutung near Vanimo (capital of West Sepik Province) and extends southeast along the \nnorthern  coast  to  Wewak  (capital  of  East  Sepik  Province)  and  Madang  (capital  of  Madang \nProvince), then farther south via Lae (capital of Morobe Province) and finally to Kerema (capital \nof Gulf Province) on the south coast of New Guinea island. The total length of the northern region \ncorridor is 1,457 km. It connects the ports of Vanimo, Wewak, Madang, and Lae to the Highlands \nhighway and southern region corridor. The existing northern region road is largely in very poor \ncondition. Significant parts are unpaved earth roads and many of them are single lanes that need \nto be widened to two lanes. The route includes three missing links: (i) Vanimo\u2013Aitape (106 km), \n(ii)  Bogia\u2013Angoram  (101  km),  and  (iii)  Wau\u2013Malalaua  (133  km).  It  will  be  very  challenging  to \ncomplete  the  route,  given  the  total  length,  the  swampy  terrain  in  the  Sepik  region,  and  the \nmountainous terrain in Morobe and Gulf provinces. Vanimo and Wewak ports are potential hubs \n\n \n\n1  Government  of  PNG,  National  Strategic  Plan  Taskforce.  2011.  Papua  New  Guinea  Vision  2050.

Vanimo  and  Wewak  have  no  customs \nfacilities. Servicing international maritime trade from Vanimo and Wewak to Indonesia and beyond \nwill play a key role in the economic growth of the northern coast area. \n \n5. \nValue added by ADB assistance. The Government of PNG has requested the support \nof the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to (i) improve the northern region corridor and (ii) continue \nthe  improvement  of  the  core  road  network  of  the  Highlands  region.  ADB  is  supporting  the \ngovernment  through  technical  assistance  (TA)  to  prepare  the  financial  analysis,  risk  and \nprocurement assessments, financial management assessment, sector assessment, climate risk \nvulnerability  assessment,  gender  assessment  and  gender  action  plan,  and  poverty  and  social \nassessment for these projects.6 As both the government and ADB are paying increasing attention \nto  the  readiness  of  projects  to  be  approved,  and  recognizing  lessons  from  the  ongoing \nmultitranche  financing  facilities  (MFFs),  additional  support  is  required.  In  this  regard,  the \ngovernment requested ADB to provide a PRF for the feasibility study, detailed design, and related \nactivities  in  parallel  with  the  TA  to  (i) achieve  high-level  readiness,  (ii)  ensure  smooth \ncommencement of procurement and other implementation activities, and (iii) ensure timely and \ncost-effective  achievement  of  the  project  outcomes.  Packaging  the  feasibility  study,  detailed \ndesign, and safeguard studies to be prepared by the same consultancy assignment will ensure \nthe design incorporates all safeguard mitigation measures. The objective is to design MFFs for \ntwo ensuing programs and one stand-alone project. The PRF will also expand and complement \nongoing MFFs and represent significant value added for the government\u2019s investment in the road \ntransport  subsector  by  providing  further  capacity  support  to  supplement  ongoing  investment \nprograms and integrate findings and lessons from previous experience into the project designs. \nInvestment  in  infrastructure  can  also  aid  the  post  coronavirus  disease  (COVID-19)  economic \nrecovery. \n \n6. \nConsistency with the ADB Strategy. The PRF is aligned with ADB\u2019s Pacific Approach, \n2016\u20132020  by  supporting  the  target  to  reduce  costs  through  improving  domestic  and  regional \nconnectivity via transport infrastructure, managing risks, and enabling value creation.7 The PRF \nis  also  aligned  with  ADB\u2019s  Strategy  2030,  by  (i)  addressing  remaining  poverty  and  reducing \ninequalities, (ii) promoting rural development and food security, and (iii) strengthening governance \nand  institutional  capacity,  as  it  will  support  physical  designs  of  transport  network  to  improve \naccess.8 Entry points for gender mainstreaming in the ensuing projects will be explored through \nPRF and TA activities. The PRF is in line with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for PNG, 2016\u2013\n2020, which supports more efficient, safer movement of people and goods\u2014one of the core areas \nof government sector objectives in the country partnership strategy.9 The MFFs, PRF, and TA to \nsupport the design of investment programs are included in ADB\u2019s country operations business \nplan, 2020\u20132022 for PNG.10 It is expected that the ensuing stand-alone project (Lae\u2013Malalaua) \nwill be included in the country operations business plan 2021\u20132023. \n \n\n \n\n6  ADB.

ADB  assistance  to  the  transport  sector  began  in  1972.  Three  MFFs  were \n7. \napproved, two for national road development and one for aviation development, between 2008\u2013\n2019.11 The government and ADB agreed to improve project readiness in future projects, given \nthat  the  Sustainable  Highlands  Highway  investment  program  has  encountered  implementation \ndelays. The completion report of project 1 of the Highlands Region Road investment program also \nrecommended  that  consulting  services  be  in  place  well  before  construction  starts,  and \nemphasized that future projects need to address weak procurement procedures.12 \n \nB. \n \n8. \nOutput  1:  Feasibility  study,  including  option  analysis,  environmental  and  social \nsafeguard  studies,  detailed  engineering  design,  bidding  documents,  and  advance \nprocurement actions for ensuing projects completed. The PRF will support the preparation \nactivities  of  the  proposed  ensuing  projects  by  preparing  the  feasibility  studies,  including \nenvironmental  and  social  safeguards;  the  detailed  engineering  designs;  and  the  bidding \ndocuments, including procurement support for three ensuing projects. \n \n9. \nOutput  2:  Capacity  of  executing  agencies  and  implementing  unit  for  project \nmanagement improved. The PRF will finance financial audits and project pre-implementation \ncapacity-building activities for executing agencies linked to the ensuing projects by establishing a \nproject implementation unit (PIU) within the Department of Works and Implementation (DOW). \n \nC. \n \n10. \nNorthern  region  road  corridor  (Momase  international  highway)  from  Wutung  to \nAngoram.  This  section  will  be  the  first  phase  of  the  proposed  MFF  program  to  improve  the \nexisting  road  from  Wutung  to  Angoram,  including  (i)  the  construction  of  the  missing  link  from \nVanimo to Aitape, with a total length of 440 km; and (ii) upgrading of Vanimo and Wewak ports.13 \nThe indicative financing amount of the program is $630 million, and the expected year of approval \nof the program and tranche 1 is 2021.14 \n \n11. \nNorthern  region  road  corridor  from  Lae  to  Malalaua  via  Bulolo  (Trans-Island \nhighway). This project will improve the Trans-Island highway from Lae to Malalaua, with a total \nlength of 308 km, including rehabilitating the existing road from Lae to Meniyama and constructing \nthe missing link of 190 km from Meniyama to Malalaua. The PRF will prepare the feasibility study \nand the detailed design for the project road. The indicative financing amount is $200 million and \nthe expected year of approval is 2022. \n \n12. \nHighlands  Region  Road Improvement Investment  Program,  Phase 2.  The  PRF  will \nprepare  a  new  MFF,  which  will be  a  continuation  of the  existing  Highlands  Region  investment \nprogram.

The  PIU \nand  PDOs  will  be  supported  and  coordinated  by  the  existing  project management  unit (PMU), \nwhich is based in Port Moresby. The PIU will enable the timely start-up and preparation of the \nensuing  projects  and,  through  support  from  consultants,  provide  on-the-job  training  and \nknowledge transfer to the executing agencies. \n \n18. \nConsulting  services.  The  government  delegated  the  consultants\u2019  selection  from  the \nexecuting  agencies  to  ADB.  The  executing  agencies  and  ADB  will  jointly  prepare the  terms  of \nreference,  budget  estimates,  and  short-listing  criteria;  and  recommend  the  choice  of  selection \nmethod.  The  DOW  will  negotiate  the  contract  with  the  first-ranked  firm;  and  the  DOW,  the \nDepartment  of  Transport  (DOT),  and  consultants  will  sign  the  contracts.  ADB  may  assist \nnegotiations, if required. The recruitment of all consultants will follow the ADB Procurement Policy \n(2017, as amended from time to time), Procurement Regulations for ADB Borrowers (2017, as \namended from time to time), and associated staff instructions. ADB has advised the borrower that \napproval of advance contracting does not commit ADB to finance the PRF. \n \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nTechnical \n\n \nA. \n \nThe PRF will support the preparation of the feasibility studies, including option analysis, \n19. \nenvironmental  assessment,  and  resettlement  plan;  detailed  design;  and  bidding  documents, \nincluding support for bidding of the works for the ensuing projects. The designs to be prepared \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\fin \n\nGovernance \n\nIntegrity  highlighted  continuing  weaknesses \n\nwill include necessary road safety features and will be subject to road safety audits. The roads to \nbe improved will follow the existing alignment to the extent possible to minimize land acquisition \nand because the road corridor available is typically limited by mountainous terrain and/or the sea. \nThe designs to be prepared will integrate any measures needed to (i) promote resilience to climate \nchange  and  disasters  triggered  by  natural  hazards,  (ii)  encourage  benefits  for  women,  and \n(iii) contribute  to  gender  equality.  The  tentative  gender  category  for  the  ensuing  projects  is \neffective gender mainstreaming or some gender elements.18 \n \nB. \n \n20. \nFinancial management. ADB has conducted a financial management assessment (FMA) \nfollowing its financial management guidelines. The assessment considered the DOW and DOT \nas the executing agencies and the PIU to manage project implementation. The FMA identified \nseveral  financial  management  risks  in  staffing,  reporting  and  monitoring,  information  systems, \naudits,  and  funds  flow.  The  project  procurement-related  reviews  (PPRRs)  prepared  by  ADB\u2019s \nOffice  of  Anticorruption  and \nfinancial \nmanagement.19 Several mitigating measures have been implemented since the previous FMA in \n2017, but further measures are proposed for the satisfactory implementation of the project and \nconsidering  that  the  PRF  will  finance  only  consulting  services.  The  most  relevant  mitigating \nmeasures  are  (i)  the  recruitment  of  qualified  accounting  staff  for  the  new  PIU  supported  by \ntargeted training on ADB financial management, (ii) inclusion of the PRF in the audit plan of the \nInternal  Audit  Division,  and  (iii)  expediting  the  implementation  of  the  international  financial \nmanagement  system  to  include  all  regional  and  provincial  offices  under  a  unified  system.  The \nestablishment  of  a  separate  account  is  a  requirement  before  the  disbursement  of  the  initial \nadvance by ADB. The detailed risk management plan is in the PAM (footnote17). The financial \nrisk is substantial.  \n \n21. \nProcurement. ADB conducted a procurement capacity assessment of the DOW and the \nPMU under the DOW, as part of the preparation of the sustainable Highlands investment program \nin 2017. The assessment identified substantial risks in staffing and effectiveness; and moderate \nrisks  in  information  management,  the  procurement  practices  of  consulting  services,  and \naccountability  measures.  The  procurement  risk  identified  in  the  areas  of  PMU  staffing  and \nprocurement practices still exists, but some progress has been achieved since 2017. Additional \nstaff, including international specialists for the ADB PMU, was recruited in 2018. They and other \nDOW staff have prepared procurement documents, which resulted in the award of several large \nworks  and  consulting  contracts.  Consequently,  the  procurement  of  goods  and  works  and  the \nrecruitment of consultant services by the DOW have become more efficient and are conducted in \nadherence  with  the  ADB  Procurement  Policy,  regulations  and  guidelines,  with  quality  and \ntransparency  acceptable  to  ADB.  In  2019,  ADB  provided  formal  procurement  training  to  the \nexecuting agencies and implementing agencies including the DOW. The training reviewed and \ndiscussed procurement issues based on findings reflected in two PPRRs prepared in June 2017 \n(footnote 19). Therefore, the risks involved in procuring consulting services are considered lower \n\n \n\n18 Gender  due  diligence  (including  gender  analysis)  and  financial  due  diligence  (including  financial  analysis)  are \nactivities included  in  the  scope  of  work  of the  consultants  preparing  due  diligence  for  the  ensuing projects  to  be \nfinanced through separate TA. \n\n19 ADB. 2017.

The procurement risk is \nsubstantial. \n \n22. \nare listed above and discussed in more detail in the PAM (footnote 17). \n \nC. \n \n23. \nSince the proposed activities consist of consulting services only, activities have not been \ncategorized per ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). The anticipated safeguard categories \nfor  all  ensuing  projects  are  category  B  for  the  environment,  category  B  for  involuntary \nresettlement, and category C for indigenous peoples, based on existing transport projects in PNG \nwith a similar scope of work. The final categorization will be confirmed early during the studies, \nbased on the documentation of baselines. The updated safeguard documents, and, if required, \nclearance under the country system and environmental permits issued by the Conservation and \nEnvironmental Protect Authority and any conditions included in the permits, will form part of the \nbidding documents.  \n \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n \n24. \nThe government has assured ADB that PRF implementation shall conform to all applicable \nADB  policies,  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures,  safeguards,  gender, \nprocurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail in the PAM and loan \ndocuments. \n \n\nV. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n \nI am satisfied that the proposed project readiness loan would comply with the Articles of \n25. \nAgreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve the \nloan  of  $31,000,000  to  Papua  New  Guinea  for  the  Transport  Sector  Preparatory  Project,  from \nADB\u2019s  ordinary capital  resources,  in concessional  terms,  with  an  interest  charge  at  the  rate  of \n2.0% per year during the grace period and thereafter; for a term of 25 years, including a grace \nperiod of 5 years; and such other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with \nthose set forth in the draft loan agreement presented to the Board. \n \n \n \n \nMasatsugu Asakawa \nPresident \n\n16 July 2020\n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\nAppendix \n\n \n \n\n \n\n1. \n2. \n\nLIST OF LINKED DOCUMENTS \nhttp://www.adb.org/Documents/RRPs/?id=53325-001-3  \n\nLoan Agreement  \nProject Administration Manual \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\f", "author_pages": [" \n", "CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 2 July 2020) \n \n", "Currency unit \nK1.00 \n$1.00 \n", "\u2013 \n= \n= \n", "kina (K) \n$0.289000 \nK3.460208 \n", "ABBREVIATIONS \n", "ADB \nCOVID-19 \nDOT \nDOW \nFMA \nkm \nMFF \nPAM \nPIU \nPMU \nPNG \nPPRR \nPRF \nTA \n", "Asian Development Bank \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \ncoronavirus disease \n\u2013  Department of Transport \n\u2013  Department of Works and Implementation \nfinancial management assessment \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \nkilometer \n\u2013  multitranche financing facility \nproject administration manual \n\u2013 \nproject implementation unit \n\u2013 \nproject management unit \n\u2013 \nPapua New Guinea \n\u2013 \nproject procurement-related review \n\u2013 \nproject readiness financing \n\u2013 \ntechnical assistance \n\u2013 \n", "NOTE \n", "In this report, \u201c$\u201d refers to United States dollars unless otherwise stated. \n", " \n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n", " \n", " \n", " \n", " \n", " \n", " \n \n", " \n \n \n \n", " \n \n \n \n", "Ahmed M.
