The  investment  project  has  the  four  outputs: \n(i) strengthened management, financing, and governance of the higher \neducation  system  including  private  higher  education  institutions; \n(ii) enhanced relevance and capacity for quality improvement of higher \neducation;  (iii)  increased  equity  and  access  in  higher  education;  and \n(iv) effective project management and implementation.  \n \nThe Government places strong emphasis on strengthening the higher \neducation  system  to  create  a  pool  of  qualified  and  skilled  personnel \nneeded  to  support  the  country\u2019s  graduation  from  least-developed \nstatus.  The  Project  responds  to  policy  priorities  in  the  National \nEducation  System  Reform  Strategy,  2006\u20132015,  approved  by  the \nPrime Minister, and is in line with the Education Sector Development \nFramework  (ESDF),  prepared  as  a  collaborative  effort  by \nthe \nGovernment and development partners. The higher education system \nneeds a clear vision, coherent policies and strategies, an appropriate \nregulatory  framework  to  promote  autonomy  and  accountability,  and a \nroad  map  to  reach  regional  and  international  standards  in  access, \nquality,  relevance,  attractiveness,  and  competitiveness.  The  Project \nwill  support  the  development  of  the  higher  education  system  and \ninstitutions  to  meet  the  growing  demand  for  educated  citizens  and  a \nskilled  workforce,  and  prepare  the  Lao  PDR  for  regional  and \ninternational economic integration.  \n \nThe  expected \nimproved  economic \ncompetitiveness  and  increased  employment  opportunities  for  higher \neducation graduates. The Project's expected outcome is an expanded, \nimproved, and equitable higher education system by 2015.  \n \n\nthe  Project \n\nimpact  of \n\nis \n\n\fii \n\nProject Investment Plan \n\nFinancing Plan \n \n \n\nPeriod of Utilization \n\nEstimated Project \nCompletion Date \n \nExecuting Agency \n \nImplementation \nArrangements \n \n\nProcurement \n\n \n\nThe  investment  cost  of  the  Project  is  estimated  at  $28.8  million \nequivalent, including taxes and duties of $1.6 million.  \n \nThe  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  will  provide  a  grant  of \n$24,800,000  from  ADB's  Special  Funds  resources.

A  project  steering \ncommittee,  chaired  by  the  MOE  vice  minister  in  charge  of  higher \neducation,  will  provide  overall  guidance  to  the  Project  and  support \ncross-agency  policy  dialogue.  A  project  coordination  unit,  headed  by \ndirector  general  of  the  Department  of  Higher  Education  (DHE)  within \nMOE, will be established to facilitate coordination and policy dialogue \nacross MOE departments and the participating universities, as well as \nday-to-day  coordination  with  other  relevant  agencies.  A  DHE  project \nimplementation  unit  (D-PIU)  will  be  established  to  provide  central \ncoordination  and  supervision  for  project  implementation.  PIUs  will  be \nestablished  in  each  participating  university  to  coordinate  with  the  D-\nPIU and concerned provincial authorities in implementing the Project, \nincluding  procurement  activities,  monitoring,  and  reporting.  To \nimplement staff and faculty development strategies and plan, a central \nprofessional  development  unit  will  be  established  under  DHE,  which \nwill  be \nto  outreach  professional \ndevelopment units established at CU and SU. The MOE vice minister \nand  DHE  director  general  will  be  responsible \nfor  overseeing \nimplementation of the gender and ethnic groups action plan. \n \nAll procurement to be financed under the ADB grant will be carried out \nin accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended \nfrom time to time). The D-PIU will be responsible for all procurement, \nexcept for civil works, equipment, furniture, and vehicles at CU, which \nwill  be  done  by  the  CU  PIU  in  close  consultation  with  the  D-PIU. \n\nlocated  at  NUOL  and \n\nlinked \n\n\fConsulting Services \n \n \n\nProject Benefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\nif \n\nless \n\nProcurement  of  goods  such  as  computers  and  laboratory  equipment \nwill use international competitive bidding procedures if more than $1.0 \nmillion,  national  competitive  bidding  if  $1.0  million  or  less  but  more \nthan  $100,000  equivalent,  or  shopping \nthan  $100,000 \nequivalent.  Civil  works  will  use  international  competitive  bidding  if \nmore  than  $2.0  million  and  national  competitive  bidding  if  less,  but \nmore  than  $100,000.  Prior  review  will  be  used  in  the  procurement \nprocesses. \n \nThe  consulting  services  for  the  Project  will  total  220  person-months \n(95  person-months  international  and  125  person-months  national)  to \nbe engaged through a firm. All consultants financed will be recruited in \nline  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2007,  as \namended  from  time  to  time).  The  selection  and  engagement  of \nconsulting  services  will  be  done  in  a  single  package  using  the \nsimplified  technical  proposal  and  quality-  and  cost-based  selection \nmethod, and follow the standard quality-cost ratio of 80:20. In addition, \nforeign visiting scholars and/or professionals will be recruited as short-\nterm consultants on an individual basis. Any assets purchased will be \nprocured  using  ADB's  Procurement  Guidelines  and,  upon  completion \nof the Project, will be turned over to MOE. \n \nThe  main  project  benefits  will  be  improved  management,  financing, \ngovernance,  relevance,  quality,  and  equity  and  access  in  higher \neducation. These will be achieved by (i) establishing an effective and \nfunctional  governance  structure,  financial  management,  and  quality \nassurance  systems  in  higher  education;  (ii)  enhancing  relevance  of \ncourse,  curriculum,  and  teaching  materials;  (iii)  upgrading  staff  and \nteacher  qualifications  with  appropriate  postgraduate  degrees  by  staff \nand  faculty  development  programs,  (iv)  improving  the  teaching  and \nlearning  environment,  mainly  at  CU; \ntargeting \ndisadvantaged  students  and  supporting  their  study  programs;  and \n(vi)  increasing  the  number  of  undergraduate  students  in  public \nuniversities  by  2015  in  accordance  with  the  ESDF  target.  The  direct \nbeneficiaries  will  be  the  nearly  400,000  university  graduates  of  the \nimproved and expanded higher education system including 300,000 at \nNUOL,  53,000  at  CU,  and  47,000  at  SU;  and  faculty  and  teaching \nstaff.  \n \nThe Project is designed to benefit the poor, women, and ethnic groups \nby  better  targeting  them,  especially  female  students  from  ethnic \ngroups,  under  (i)  the  revised  student  quota  system  to  increase  the \nratio  of  female  quota  students  from  ethnic  groups,  and  (ii)  the \nprovision  of  increased  living  allowances  to  disadvantaged  quota \nfemale  dormitory \nstudents. \naccommodation  and  female  amenities  blocks,  the  number  of  female \nstudents  enrolled  at  CU  will  increase  from  1,713  (35%  of  total \nenrollments)  to  4,000  by  2015  (50%).  Recruitment  and  training  of \nfaculty members and staff will give special preference to women from \nethnic groups.  \n \n\nIn  addition,  due \n\n(v)  effectively \n\nto  expanded \n\niii \n\n \n\n\fiv \n\nRisks and Assumptions \n\nin \n\nflexibility \n\nfinancial  mechanisms \n\nA  primary  risk  for  the  higher  education  system  is  that  the  envisaged \nuniversity  autonomy  will  not  be  materialized  fully  and  will  not  be \naccompanied  by  independent  university  governance  structure,  and \nadequate \nto  enable  public \nuniversities  to  reach  regional  standards  in  teaching,  learning,  and \nresearch.  This  risk  may  be  mitigated  through  (i)  the  ESDF  annual \nplanning  and  policy  dialogue  process,  (ii)  the  ongoing  review  and \nassessment process by senior MOE officials and other stakeholders to \nsecure broad support of the reform agenda, and (iii) advisory support \nfrom ADB and other development agencies for ongoing policy studies \nand related reforms.  \n \nQuota  students  are  not  charged  tuition  fees  and  receive  living \nallowances.  The  Project  intends  to  restructure  the  student  quota \nadmission  system  to  improve  targeting  of  poor  and  disadvantaged \nstudents  so  that  the  overall  budget  allocation  in  the  form  of  tuition \nsubsidies  and  living  allowances  will  be  more  equitable.  This  initiative \nmay  encounter  political  difficulties  with  resistance  from  those  who \nwould lose privileges. However most provinces have indicated their in-\nprinciple  agreement  to  reduce  the  number  of  quota  students.  To \nmitigate  this  risk,  the  Project  will  support  (i)  continuing  dialogue  on \nstudent  admission  reform  between  public  university  presidents  and \nconcerned provincial authorities, (ii) promoting public campaigns, and \n(iii) introducing the phased reduction of the number of quota students.  \n \nPublic universities may not be able to recover costs of their operations \nincluding  salaries  of  staff  and  faculty  members,  and  operation  and \nmaintenance of the facilities and equipment to be developed under the \nProject,  such  as  information  and  communication  technology-based \nteaching  and  learning  centers.  This  risk  is  mitigated  by  (i)  a  prime \nministerial decree enabling public universities to charge tuition fees for \nregular  nonquota  students,  who  will  comprise  approximately  80%  of \nuniversity  intakes;  and  (ii)  advisory  support  to  increase  university \nrevenues through income-generating activities.  \n \nA  further  risk  may  be  represented  by  MOE\u2019s  limited  capacity  to \nmanage  and  implement  new  policies  envisaged  under  the  Project. \nThis  risk  can  be  mitigated  by  extensive  advisory  support  for  sector \nplanning  and  management,  and  consulting  services  to  facilitate \nimplementation  of  the  legislative  and  regulatory  framework  to  be \ndeveloped during project implementation. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n\f\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n \n1. \nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed grant \nto  the  Lao  People\u2019s  Democratic  Republic  (Lao  PDR)  for  the  Strengthening  Higher  Education \nProject (the Project). The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\nrelevance,  and  competitiveness.  The  Government  asked \n\n \n2. \nThe  Government  seeks  to  achieve  economic  growth  with  reduced  poverty  to  meet  the \nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs) by 2015 and graduate from its least-developed country \nstatus by 2020. The Sixth Socio-Economic Development Plan 2006\u20132010 (SEDP6) provides a \ncoherent and cohesive development framework, identifying education as one of the four pillars \nof  its  poverty  reduction  strategy.  The  SEDP6  recognizes  that  education  is  fundamental  to \nsocioeconomic  development,  since  it  equips  citizens  with  skills  and  attitudes  required  in  a \nrapidly  changing  society.1 Continued  modernization  and  the  shift  to  a  more  knowledge-  and \ntechnology-based economy place growing pressure on the Lao PDR to expand and improve the \nhigher  education  system  and  institutions.  However,  the  higher  education  system  still  lacks  a \nclear vision, policy and strategies, and road map to reach regional and international standards in \naccess,  quality, \nthe  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) to support the development of the higher education system to meet \ngrowing  demands  for  educated  citizens  and  a  skilled  workforce,  and  to  help  prepare  the  Lao \nPDR  for  regional  and  international  economic  integration. 2 The  Project  is  included  as  a  firm \nproject in 2009 in the midterm review for the 2007\u20132011 country strategy and program.3 \n \nA. \n \n3.  \nSocioeconomic and Poverty Indicators. The Lao PDR, one of the poorest countries in \nAsia  and  the  Pacific,  experiences  many  constraints  to  development  and  poverty  reduction, \nincluding  in  the  education  sector.  However,  economic  performance  has  been  impressive  over \nthe past 5 years. Real gross domestic product growth averaged 7.3% between 2003 and 2008. \nWhile  7.9%  growth  is  projected  for  2009,  the  impact  of  the  current  global  recession  must  be \ncarefully  monitored.  Per  capita  income  climbed  to  $840  in  2008  from  $581  in  2006.  Rapid \neconomic growth has contributed to substantial progress in poverty reduction, with the national \npoverty incidence falling from 33.3% in 2003 to 28% in 2008. Steady progress to achieving the \nMDGs is noted with declining fertility, improving infant and child mortality rates, and increasing \nschool  enrollment.  Demographic  projections  show  the  secondary  school  and  higher  education \nage populations reaching their maximum size between 2005 and 2020. Thus, one outcome of \nachieving the MDGs is a burgeoning demand for higher education. \n \n4. \nEducation  Sector  Performance.  The  Government  has  made  considerable  progress  in \nimproving access to education. From 2000 to 2005, the net enrollment ratio4 for primary education \nincreased from 80% to 84%; the gross enrollment ratio5 for lower secondary increased from 47% \nto  52%,  and  for  upper  secondary  from  23%  to  35%.  Progress  with  girls'  enrollment  has  been \nrapid.  The  gender  differential  at  primary  grades  has  dropped  by  appropriately  7.4%  since  1996 \n\n                                                 \n1  Government  of  the  Lao  PDR,  Committee  for  Planning  and  Investment.  2005.

Manila. \n\n4   The net enrollment ratio refers to pupils enrolled from the eligible age group.  \n5   The gross enrollment ratio refers to total pupils enrolled. \n\n\f(from 21.6% to 14.2% in 2005).6 At lower secondary, girls' enrollment increased by more than 4% \nfrom 2003 to 2005, compared with a 1.9% increase for boys. During the same period, girls' upper \nsecondary  enrollment  increased  by  4.4%  compared  with  a  5.5%  increase  for  boys.  Even  so, \nsignificant gender differentials remain: Girls' enrollment in primary lags by approximately 14%, and \nat  the  entry  level  for  lower  secondary  education  is  more  than  10%  less  than  that  of  boys. \nExtensive external development support has concentrated on primary education to meet the MDG \nof  universal  completion  of  primary  education  by  2015.  If  primary  education  absorbs  all  external \nfunding,  subsequent  levels  of  education  will  continue  to  be  neglected,  which  will  have  serious \nramifications. First, the gains from increased primary enrollments may be lost if lower and upper \nsecondary are not ready to absorb primary school graduates. Second, quality and access issues \nbecome  more  difficult  to  resolve  with  increasing  numbers  of  students  (footnote  3).  The  rise  in \nupper  secondary  enrollment,  a  growing  school  age  population,  and  declining  poverty  have \nresulted in an explosion in the demand for technical and vocational education and training (TVET) \nand  higher  education.  As  this  relentless  demand  occurs  as  the  country  moves  through  its \ndemographic  transition,  the  quality  of  postsecondary  education  must  be  improved  before  this \nlargest age cohort moves into the labor force.  \n \n5. \nGovernment  Sector  Strategy  and  Institutions.  To  graduate  from  least-developed \ncountry  status  by  2020  and  to  prepare  for  the  country\u2019s  regional  and  international  integration, \nthe  Government  initiated  higher  education  reforms  covering  both  public  and  private  higher \neducation  institutions  (HEIs)  with  the  Prime  Ministerial  Decree  on  the  Establishment  of  the \nNational  University  of  Laos  (NUOL)  in  1995,  and  subsequent  decrees  on  private  higher \neducation  in  1995  and  higher  education  curriculum  in  2001.  The  decree  establishing  NUOL \nbegan to address the issue of a fragmented higher education system by amalgamating 10 HEIs \nunder  a  unified  structure  of  NUOL.  Within  the  framework,  two  regional  universities  were  later \nestablished to broaden access to higher education: (i) Champasak University (CU) in Pakse in \nsouthern  Lao  PDR  in  2002,  and  (ii)  Souphanouvong  University  (SU)  in  Luang  Prabang  in \nnorthern Lao PDR in 2003. Meanwhile, the decree on private higher education defined a legal \nframework for establishing and operating private HEIs, and triggered the growth of private HEIs. \nIn  2007,  the  Prime  Ministerial  Decree  on  the  Adoption  and  Implementation  of  the  National \nEducation  System  Reform  Strategy  (NESRS)  (2006\u20132015)  was  issued.  The  decree  called  for \nstrengthened  HEIs  to  move  the  higher  education  system  toward  regional  and  international \nstandards, and contribute to the socioeconomic development of the country. NUOL was given \nautonomous  administrative  authority.  SU  and  CU  were  given  autonomous  administrative \nauthorities by the Prime Ministerial Decree on the Organization and the Activities of the SU and \nCU, issued in March and April 2009, respectively.  \n \n6.  \nThe  Ministry  of  Education  (MOE)  has  broad  oversight  of  all  education  development  in \nthe  Lao  PDR,  and  MOE\u2019s  Department  of  Higher  Education  (DHE),  which  was  separated  from \nthe  Department  of  Higher,  Technical  and  Vocational  Education  in  April  2008,  provides  overall \npolicy  guidance  to  public  universities,  undertakes  planning  and  coordination  with  other \ngovernment  ministries  and  agencies  for  developing  the  higher  education  system,  and \ncooperates with development partners in support of higher education. Under the Government's \ndecentralization  process,  MOE  shares  responsibilities  with  the  provincial  education  services \n(PESs)  and  the  district  education  bureaus.  The  PESs  are  responsible  for  secondary,  and \ntechnical and vocational schools not under MOE jurisdiction. In cooperation with the PESs and \npublic  universities,  MOE  administers  university  entrance  examinations  in  each  province,  while \nthe  PESs  are  responsible  for  selecting  quota  students  based  on  upper  secondary  completion \nexamination  scores  and  recommendations.  District  education  bureaus  are  responsible  for \n\n                                                 \n6   Ministry of Education. 2008. Education for All Mid-Decade Assessment. Vientiane.  \n\n2 \n\n \n\n\fpreschools, primary schools, and nonformal education institutions. NUOL, CU, and SU, as first \nrank budgeting units, have their own budgets and can request annual budgets directly from the \nMinistry of Finance, which is responsible for allocating staff salaries and other recurrent costs. \n \nAt present, higher education in the Lao PDR comprises three public universities (NUOL, \n7. \nCU,  and  SU),  the  Ministry  of  Health-administered  University  of  Health  Sciences,  five  teacher \ntraining colleges, and 86 private  HEIs. In 2008, about 5.3% of the tertiary education age cohort \nwas  enrolled  at  the  HEIs.  Student  enrollment  at  the  three  public  universities  totalled  45,677 \n(NUOL  with  36,706,  CU  with  4,755,  and  SU  with  4,216),  increasing  by  about  10,000  in  1  year \nalone from 35,403 in 2007. The number of students at private HEIs increased from 4,000 in 2000 \nto  almost  20,000  in  2007.  However,  in  2007,  only  24,754  of  43,653  students  (about  57%) \ngraduating  from  upper  secondary  school  gained  access  to  public  and  private  HEIs.  This  gap \nbetween enrollment demand and admission capacity of public universities is expected to widen if \ncurrent  trends  continue.  The  public  university  admission  system  comprises  three  types  of \nstudents: (i) quota students, who are exempt from all fees and receive a small living allowance, \naccount for roughly 50% of total enrollment; (ii) regular nonquota students, who take the university \nentrance  examination  and  pay  a  modest  registration  fee,  comprise  another  20%  of  total \nenrollment; and (iii) an additional roughly 30% of students are enrolled in \"special courses;\" they \nare not selected from university entrance examination results but sit for entrance examinations of \nspecific faculties; they are charged tuition and registration fees. \n \nB. \n \n8.  \nHigher  education  in  the  Lao  PDR  is  at  a  nascent  stage  of  development.  The  higher \neducation  system  and  institutions  need  to  be  strengthened  and  upgraded  by  improving  \n(i) management, financing, and governance; (ii) relevance, quality, and efficiency; and (iii) equity \nand access.7 An analysis of higher education is in Appendix 2.  \n \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\n1. \n\nGovernance, Finance, and Management  \n\n \n9.   Weak  Management  Capacity.  The  higher  education  system  lacks  overall  planning, \nmanagement,  and  monitoring.  DHE\u2019s  management  capacity  is  not  adequate  for  it  to  meet  its \nresponsibilities.  Capacity  building  of  DHE  personnel  to  effectively  and  efficiently  manage  the \nhigher  education  system  is  an  MOE  priority.  In  addition,  higher  education  does  not  currently \nhave a standardized system for the coordinated collection, dissemination, and utilization of up-\nto-date  data  and  information  to  support  policy  development,  planning,  administration,  and \nmanagement of higher education.  \n \n10. \nInadequate  Higher  Education  Financing.  Public  expenditure  on  education  (both \nrecurrent  and  capital  budget)  has  been  increasing  in  recent  years.  However,  the  budget \nallocation  for  education,  including  external  aid,  for  2008\u20132009  varies  from  10%  to  14%  of  the \ntotal  government  budget  (depending  on  the  budget  data  sources).  In  higher  education,  the \npercentage of  recurrent  expenditure  is  almost 90%  of  the  total  higher education  budget,  while \nthe  capital  investment  is  10%.  Despite  the  extremely  high  proportion  of  budgetary  funds \nallocated for salaries and student stipends, the allotment is still insufficient to provide adequate \nsalaries  and  other  financial  incentives  to  teaching  staff  in  universities.  Resources  for \nmaintenance, renovation, infrastructure improvement, and academic and staff development are \nvirtually nonexistent (excepting external aid). The problem is compounded by the limited formal \nattention given to cost recovery by introducing adequate tuition fees and improving targeting of \n\n                                                 \n7   Information for this section is largely drawn from ADB. 2009. Final Report for Technical Assistance for Preparing \n\nthe Strengthening Higher Education Project. Manila.  \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\fquota students receiving a government subsidy. While expansion of private HEIs helps lessen \nthe  financial  burden  on  the  public  sector  and  absorbs  excess  or  unmet  demand  for  higher \neducation,  public  HEIs  urgently  need  to  expand  cost-recovery  measures  and  make  the  public \nhigher education system more cost-efficient and sustainable. This in turn will expand resources \navailable for investment in basic education.  \n \n11.   Weak University Governance. A series of prime ministerial decrees on the organization \nand activities of NUOL, CU, and SU were issued in March and April 2009. Although NUOL has \nalready  established  a  university  council,  executive  board,  and  board  of  academic  affairs,  CU \nand  SU  still  need  to  establish  functional  governance  structures  and  well-defined  financial \nmanagement systems, based on the new decrees. Moreover, the precise governance status of \nCU  and  SU,  in  particular  their  degree  of  autonomy  and  relationship  with  the  private  sector, \nremains  unclear.  Appropriate  governance  reforms  (including  clarification  of  their  governance \nstructure  and  status)  represent  an  essential  precondition  for  the  implementation  of  reform \nstrategies for higher education.  \n \nLack  of  Coherent  Regulatory  Framework  for  Private  HEIs.  In  recent  years,  the \n12.  \nnumber  of  private  HEIs  has  grown  rapidly  to  absorb  excess  demand  for  higher  education. \nHowever,  private  HEIs  are  largely  unregulated.  Little  information  is  available  on  the  relevance \nand quality of these institutions. The Government needs to help the private sector ensure quality \nby  establishing  standards  and  quality  assurance  procedures.  Development  of  a  coherent \nregulatory  framework  is  urgently  required  to  ensure  their  quality  standards  and  relevance  to \nlabor market demand.  \n \n\n2. \n\nRelevance, Quality, and Efficiency \n\n \n13.   Unknown Relevance. No labor surveys or labor market projections are available for use \nto measure the performance of the tertiary system or education planning. In 2005, 93% of the \nlabor force are own account and unpaid family workers; only 7% are formal sector employees \nalmost equally divided between government and the private sector.8 Rapid labor market surveys \ncarried out under the project preparatory technical assistance (PPTA) are a first step in tracking \ngraduates  in  the  labor  market  (footnote  2).  Appropriate  tracer  studies  need  to  be  launched  to \ncollect benchmark information and monitor their performance in the labor market. Initial results \nindicate  a  shortage  of  professional  and \ntechnical  personnel  such  as  administrators, \naccountants, lawyers, and engineers in public and private sectors; and growing demand in the \ncommercial  sector  such  as  customer  service,  hotel  and  guesthouse  operations,  foreign \nlanguages, tourism operations, and computer technology. These fields are offered by the higher \neducation system, yet  graduates report difficulty getting jobs in their field of study. One partial \nexplanation of this apparent market failure may be an inefficient job placement system and the \nemployer's desire for experienced staff against the graduate's need for a first job.  \n \nThe pool of university graduates is young. From 2000 to 2006, the number of graduates \n14. \nproduced  by  the  public  system  increased  from  2,200  per  year  to  6,000  per  year.  The  bulk  of \nuniversity graduates are still in transition in their first job or developing their understanding of the \nworkplace and work skills. The difficulty is compounded by the out-of-date learning material and \ninexperience of their instructors. The private sector is also young: 20% of all enterprises were \nestablished less than 1 year ago and 60% are less than 5 years old; only 2.4% have more than \n10 employees.9 One result of this young employer and young employee profile is a shortfall in \n\n                                                 \n8   Ministry  of  Planning  and  Investment.  2005.

This contributes to the frustration reported by \nemployers that university graduates lack the right skills and the frustration by students that they \ncannot practice what they were taught. \n \nIrrelevant  Curriculum  and  Textbooks.  In  accordance  with  the  NESRS,  MOE  will \n15. \nintroduce a new system of 5 years primary, 4 years lower secondary, 3 years upper secondary, \nand  4  years  higher  education  (undergraduate)  in  a  phased  manner  from  September  2009  to \nSeptember 2011. National higher education curriculum reform should be planned in connection \nwith  NESRS  implementation.  Whereas  public  universities  formally  offered  a  common  core \n\"foundation studies\" curriculum to all students at the start of their university studies, NUOL has \ndissolved its former School of Foundation Studies. Similarly, individual faculties of CU and SU \nneed to prepare to conduct their own basic foundation programs. This creates inconsistencies \nand duplication of efforts, and may not be the most effective and efficient use of limited faculty \nresources,  textbooks,  and  materials,  or  provide  the  best  grounding  for  students.  To  enhance \nrelevance  and  effectiveness  of  curriculum  and  textbooks,  a  strengthened  interdisciplinary \ncommon-core  curriculum  and  textbooks  need  to  be  introduced  as  foundation  programs  to  be \noffered  throughout  different  faculties  at  year  1,  and  faculty-specific  curriculum  and  textbooks \nand materials developed for specialization programs for years 2\u20134.  \n \n16.   Weak  Quality  Assurance,  Accreditation,  and  Credit  System. Quality assurance and \naccreditation  systems  are  under  development,  but  are  not  yet  functioning.  MOE\u2019s  Quality \nAssurance Center (QAC) is currently responsible for developing quality assurance policies and \nprocedures for all education subsectors, including public and private higher education as well as \nsecondary  education  and  technical  education  and  vocational  training.  However,  QAC  is \nrelatively  new  and  its  capacity  needs  to  be  greatly  strengthened.  Currently,  no  standardized \nsystem  is  in  place  to  allocate  credit  for  subject  units  completed  from  year  to  year.  Credit  is \nallocated  on  the  basis  of  contact  time  rather  than  total  workload.  Student  transfer  between \nuniversities is very difficult due to the lack of a standardized credit system. \n \nLow  Qualifications  of  Academic  Staff.  The  quality  of  higher  education  is  low  due  to \n17.  \nunderqualified  academic  staff.  Few \nfaculty  members  have  postgraduate  qualifications, \nparticularly  at  the  newly  opened  CU  and  SU,  and  their  research  and  teaching  capacity  are \nteaching  staff  with \ngreatly  constrained.  While  NUOL  has  a  reasonably  well-qualified \napproximately 32% (490 of 1,520 teaching staff) having postgraduate degrees, the situation at \nCU and SU is problematic. Of 221 academic staff at CU, only 4 have doctoral qualifications and \n31  have  master\u2019s  degrees.  Of  the  192  total  staff  at  SU,  only  2  have  doctoral  degrees  and  21 \nhave master\u2019s degrees. University teaching capacities are further constrained by excessive time \nspent teaching additional fee-based special courses up to 30 hours per week or more. Due to \nlow formal salaries paid to academic staff, public universities have difficulty retaining skilled and \nexperienced academic personnel, leaving the universities with an insufficient number of young, \nunderqualified,  and  relatively  inexperienced  staff.  Both  teacher  performance  and  students\u2019 \nacademic performance are largely unknown compared with regional and international standards.  \n \n18.  Weak Research Capacity. The academic research capacity of faculty members is quite \nlimited. Time spent teaching in special courses held mostly in the evenings, and the absence of \nappropriate  research  infrastructure  and  funding  compound  the  problem.  The  type  of  research \ntargeted for these universities directly supports degree education and teaching, since the higher \neducation system  and  institutions  in  the  Lao  PDR  are  in  their  early  stage  of  development  and \nthe three public universities (NUOL, CU, and SU) continue to focus on degree education rather \nthan on the development of science and technology disciplines as research universities. Among \nthe  three  public  universities,  only  NUOL  has  a  reasonably  well-qualified  teaching  staff  with \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\fInadequate  Teaching  and  Learning  Environment.  Teaching  and \n\npostgraduate degrees who can carry out some research activities; the other two universities are \nconstrained by a severe shortage of qualified teaching staff and limited research facilities. \n \n19.  \nlearning \nenvironments  need  to  be  greatly  improved  by  investing  in  facilities,  equipment,  and  materials. \nWhile  NUOL  and  SU  are  relatively  well  developed  and  equipped,  the  newly  opened  CU  lacks \nadequate  physical  facilities  including  library,  laboratory  facilities  and  equipment,  auditorium, \nclassrooms, and other essential teaching and learning equipment and materials. CU's campus \ninfrastructure (e.g., water and power supply, road conditions, and drainage system) and facilities \nare  in  dilapidated  condition  and  cannot  support  further  increases.  Library  facilities  using \ninformation  and  communication  technology  (ICT)  vary  considerably  across  each  campus. \nAccess  to  computers  with  internet  terminals  at  NUOL  and  SU  is  limited.  CU  currently  has  no \nviable libraries with internet access to serve the faculty and students. Site development plans for \nCU  propose  the  construction  of  a  multipurpose  central  building  to  be  used  for  establishing  an \nICT-based teaching and learning center incorporating e-library facilities. Laboratories, especially \nat CU, lack appropriate equipment and materials for teaching and research.  \n \n20.  Weak  International  Links.  International  partnerships  are  largely  symbolic  rather  than \npractical,  and  are  not  adequately  resourced.  The  three  public  universities  are  promoting \ncooperation  with  foreign  universities  and  institutions  (e.g.,  student  and  faculty  exchange,  joint \nresearch,  and  publication)  to  foster  international  recognition  and  attractiveness.  For  example, \nNUOL has about 145 academic exchange agreements with foreign universities and institutions; \nhowever, to date these endeavors have had limited success or influence on education quality. \nInternationalization of Lao universities and their linkages to international standard or world class \nuniversities must be promoted on a long-term and sustainable basis.  \n \n\n3. \n\nEquity and Access \n\n \n21.   Disparities  in  Enrollment  and  Quota  System.  Socioeconomic,  gender,  and  ethnic \ndisparities in access still persist, resulting in low representation of women and ethnic students \nfrom low-income families. In 2008, the share of female students was 35.3% at NUOL, 36.6% at \nSU, and 49% at CU. The quota system of admission was originally intended to increase access \nto higher education for ethnic origin students. The provinces identify quota students in principle \non  the  basis  of  seeking  equity  by  gender  and  ethnicity.  At  NUOL,  ethnic  quota  students \ncomprise  approximately  35%  and  ethnic  female  quota  students  approximately  17%  of  the \nstudent population. However, better targeting of quota students is needed to increase equity in \naccess  to  higher  education.  Provision  of  a  substantial  amount  of  state  subsidies  to  students \nfrom more affluent families (rather than for lowering barriers to students who otherwise have no \ncapacity  to  pay)  is  inequitable  and  diverts  budgetary  resources  from  interventions  to  increase \naccess  and  quality.  At  the  same  time,  when  disadvantaged  students  are  correctly  targeted, \nmany are academically behind other students, as they have not been adequately prepared by \nthe  general  schooling  system.  The  academic  preparation  of  quota  students  needs  to  be \nimproved. A gap also exists between the rural poor and urban nonpoor in terms of opportunities \nand access to higher education. Poor rural students are reluctant to enrol in courses that require \nmathematics  for  entrance  or  course  exams.  They  generally  enrol  in  education,  geography, \nlinguistics, or agriculture where they can be easily accepted.  \n \n22. \nGap  between  Enrollment and  Limited  Capacity. The demand for higher education is \nprojected  to  increase.  While  NUOL  and  SU  have  expanded  their  enrollment  capacity  mainly \nbecause of external assistance in developing the campus and facilities, the need for additional \nfacilities  and  classrooms  at  CU  to  meet  growing  local  demand  is  overwhelming.  Among  the \nthree  public  universities,  CU  has  the  most  basic  infrastructure  and  facilities.  Since  its \n\n6 \n\n \n\n\festablishment  in  2002,  the  number  of  students  has  increased  from  400  to  4,755.  Classroom \nspace  at  CU  is  extremely  limited,  crowded,  and  often  shared  among  faculties  in  a  suboptimal \nmanner.  The  gap  between  enrollment  demand  and  admission  capacity  of  public  universities, \nespecially at CU, is expected to widen in the future if current trends continue. In response, many \nsmall private HEIs have emerged in recent years (mainly offering diplomas in business-related \nareas  such  as  business  administration,  computer  and  information  science,  and  English \nlanguage) to meet this unmet demand.  \n\n \n4. \n\nLessons  \n\n \n23. \nFor  tertiary  education,  ADB  supported  the  establishment  and  development  of  NUOL \nfrom  1995  to  2003  under  the  Postsecondary  Education  Rationalization  Project, 10  when \nimproving the quality of NUOL and developing two universities (CU and SU) were envisaged as \nthe  next  phase  in  the  development  of  higher  education.  One  of  the  loan  covenants  under  the \nPostsecondary Education Rationalization Project was to reduce the number of quota students to \n50%;  this  serves  as  a  benchmark  ratio  of  quota  students  in  2009.  The  national  entrance \nexamination  was  established  for  the  first  time  for  the  1996  intake  at  NUOL.  The  students  are \nnow referred to as nonquota students. Other specific lessons from the Postsecondary Education \nRationalization  Project  are  that  NUOL  needs  to  (i)  give  priority  to  the  quality  of  education  and \nhuman resources that it produces; and (ii) ensure its external efficiency by promoting an alumni \nassociation,  including  employers  as  members  of  the  university  council;  establishing  a  regular \nmonitoring function, in particular the graduate tracer study; and introducing career counseling.11 \nThese lessons are incorporated in the project design as appropriate.  \n \nADB  has  also  supported  postsecondary  and  higher  education  projects  in  Bangladesh, \n24. \nCambodia, Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, Sri Lanka, Thailand, and Viet Nam; and is preparing \nnew  postsecondary  and  higher  education  projects  in  Indonesia,  Mongolia,  Lao  PDR,  and  Viet \nNam. A major relevant lesson from projects is that key private enterprises need to be involved at \nthe  design  phase  to  ensure  that  the  skills  taught  are  relevant  to  market  demand.  The  Project \naddresses  this  lesson  by  (i)  undertaking  periodic  tracer  studies  of  university  graduates  in \ncooperation with private enterprises, (ii) introducing career orientation and counseling programs \nbased  on  results  of  tracer  studies,  and  (iii)  including  representatives  from  local  industries  as \nuniversity  council  members.  Across  sectors,  concerns  relate  to  the  capacity  to  manage  and \nimplement  projects;  these  are  incorporated  in  the  project  design  to  increase  effectiveness  of \nproject management and implementation.  \n \n \n \n25. \nIn  line  with  the  SEDP6  strategies  and  priorities,  ADB's  2007\u20132010  country  strategy  and \nprogram  aims  to  assist  the  Lao  PDR  in  (i)  promoting  pro-poor,  sustainable  growth;  (ii)  fostering \ninclusive  social  development;  and  (iii)  addressing  priority  governance  issues  (footnote  3).  In \naddition, ADB\u2019s priority sector support remains fully aligned with the four core sectors under the \nSEDP6: agriculture, health, education, and infrastructure. The 2009 midterm review of the country \nstrategy  and  program  confirms  that  ADB\u2019s  strategy  for  the  education  sector  should  continue  to \ngive priority to helping the Government expand access to a full range of quality schooling for all \nchildren,  with  continuing  investments  in  basic  education  with  a  focus  on  lower  secondary \n\nAsian Development Bank Country Strategy and Program \n\n5. \n\n                                                 \n10  ADB. 1995.

This  will  need  to  be  matched  by  a  gradual  shift  in  emphasis  to  strengthening  upper \nsecondary education and providing better vocational, technical, and higher education.  \n \n26. \nAlthough fully cognizant of the need to strengthen basic education, as being supported \nby  the  Second  Education  Quality  Improvement  Project  and  the  Basic  Education  Sector \nDevelopment  Program, 12  ADB  shares  the  Government\u2019s  concern  of  the  need  for  balanced \neducation sector development and gradual expansion of access to TVET (PPTA in 200913 and \nan  ensuing  project  in  2010)  and  higher  education  (PPTA  in  2008  and  an  ensuing  project  in \n2009) (footnote 2) to meet the demand for greater educational attainment and a more educated \nand  skilled  workforce.  In  supporting  higher  education,  ADB  will  help  the  Government  improve \nhigher education financing to become shared, cost-efficient, and sustainable, which will in turn \nenhance sustainability of the entire education system, including basic education.  \n \n\nAsian Development Bank and Other External Assistance \n\n6. \n \nSeveral  development  partners  provide  assistance  to  the  education  sector. 14  The \n27. \nAustralian  Agency  for  International  Development  (AusAID),  European  Commission,  and  World \nBank focus on supporting primary education. The German development cooperation through the \nGerman  Agency  for  Technical  Cooperation  and  the  Luxembourg  Government  focus  on  TVET. \nThe Republic of Korea, through the Export-Import Bank of Korea, supported the development of \nSU from 2005 to 2006. The Education Sector Working Group, cochaired by AusAID and United \nNations  Children's  Fund  (UNICEF),  coordinates  development  aid.  While  the  existence  of  the \nEducation Sector Working Group has led to improved aid coordination, provincial coordination \nof development partner interventions remains mixed. AusAID, European Commission, UNICEF, \nand  the  World  Bank  are  also  supporting  the  Poverty  Reduction  Support  Operation  including \neducation triggers. Most recently, concerned development partners endorsed the Government's \napplication to the Catalytic Fund under the Education for All-Fast Track Initiative. A summary of \nexternal assistance is in Appendix 3. \n \n28.  MOE,  in  collaboration  with  development  partners,  has  developed  the  Education  Sector \nDevelopment  Framework  (ESDF)  to  cover  planning  and  investment  across  the  full  education \nsector  for  2009\u20132015.  ADB  partnered  with  AusAID  to  support  development  of  the  ESDF.  The \nESDF  outlines policy priorities  for  improving access to education services; improving the  quality \nand relevance of education services; and increasing the efficiency and effectiveness of education \nplanning,  management,  and  administration  of  the  sector.  The  ESDF  provides  a  vehicle  for \nestablishing  education  priorities  to  match  resource  availability  and  will  enable  the  formulation  of \nannual costed and prioritized plans, which are a requirement of the Vientiane Declaration Country \nAction Plan in line with the Paris Declaration of Aid Effectiveness in 2005. The Annual Sector Plan \nfor 2009\u20132010, under the ESDF process, includes improvement and expansion of facilities at CU, \nand improvement of quality of teaching and learning at universities. It includes the development of \na higher education master plan for 2010\u20132020, which is under preparation with support from the \nADB PPTA for preparing the Strengthening Higher Education Project (footnote 2).  \n\n                                                 \n12  ADB. 2001.

The  Project's  expected \noutcome is an expanded, improved, and equitable higher education system by 2015.  \n \nB. \n \n30.  \nThe  Project  will  deliver  four  outputs  to  achieve  the  outcome:  (i)  strengthened \nmanagement,  financing,  and  governance  of  the  higher  education  system;  (ii)  enhanced \nrelevance  and  capacity  for  quality  improvement;  (iii)  increased  equity  and  access  in  higher \neducation; and (iv) effective project management and implementation.  \n \n\nOutputs \n\n1. \n\nOutput  1:  Strengthened  Management,  Financing,  and  Governance  of  the \nHigher Education System  \n\n \n31.  \nThe  Project  will  build  management,  financing,  and  governance  of  the  higher  education \nsystem  through  (i)  strengthened  management  capacity  of  MOE  and  public  HEIs,  (ii)  improved \nhigher education financing, and (iii) enhanced governance systems for public and private HEIs.  \n \n\na. \n\nStrengthened Management Capacity of MOE and Public HEIs \n\n \n32. \nThe Project will enhance the management capacity of DHE, to be responsible for overall \nstrategic  planning  and  master  plan  development,  and  for  operations  oversight  of  the  higher \neducation  system  in  the  Lao  PDR.  DHE  is  expected  to  be  reorganized  to  better  perform  its \nmandate  and  functions,  including  jurisdiction  over  private  HEIs  offering  degrees,  which  will \nrequire upgraded planning and management skills and knowledge. The Project will strengthen \nmanagement  capacity  of  relevant  DHE  staff  by  supporting  (i)  in-country  and  international \ntraining;  (ii)  degree  programs  (indicatively  four  DHE  staff  in  master\u2019s  programs  and  three  in \ndoctoral  programs);  and  (iii)  DHE  participation  in  international  forums,  conferences,  and \nassociations (including membership fees). The Project will develop a management information \nsystem  (MIS)  comprising  financial  management,  personnel  management  including  faculty  and \nstudent  database,  and  student  admission  data;  and  provide  capacity  development  support  to \nmanagement staff for implementing the MIS to enhance management efficiency throughout the \nhigher education system at DHE and each public HEI. The Project will help DHE prepare annual \nand  periodic  reports  and  newsletters,  and  in  coordination  with  MOE\u2019s  Department  of  Planning \nand  Cooperation,  better  manage  projects  and  programs  supported  by  official  development \nassistance.  \n \n\nb. \n\nImproved Higher Education Financing \n\n \n33. \nSupport  will  be  provided  to  improve  financing  of  higher  education  to  become  more \nshared,  cost-efficient,  and  sustainable.  The  Project  will  help  MOE  and  public  universities  to \n(i)  review  the  budgeting  process  and  mechanism  to  identify  weakness,  and  improve,  for \nexample, its efficiency and relevance by adding a specific budget line of block funding to cover \noperation  and  maintenance,  and  depreciation  of  facilities  and  equipment;  (ii)  restructure  the \nquota  student  admission  system  to  improve  targeting  of  poor  and  disadvantaged  students  so \nthat overall budget allocation in the form of tuition subsidies and living allowances will be more \nequitable; (iii) increase tuition fees for regular nonquota students; and (iv) diversify the revenue \nsources of public universities, in cooperation with the private sector.  \n \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\fThe prime ministerial decrees issued during March\u2013April 2009 enable public universities to \n34.  \ncharge  tuition  fees.  The  Project  will  support  the  preparation  and  introduction  of  tuition  fees  for \nregular nonquota courses and the regularization of special courses staring from 2011/12 onward. \nThe  fees  generated  will  contribute  to  financing  recurrent  operating  costs  of  the  universities, \nincluding  staff  salaries.  In  association  with  the  phased  reduction  of  quota  students  from  50%  in \n2009 to 30% by 2013 and 20% by 2015 (to better target disadvantaged students), tuition fees will \nbe  progressively  charged  for  the  remaining  80%  of  nonquota  students,  as  a  significant  cost \nrecovery  measure  for  universities.  Different  tuition  fees  are  expected  to  be  charged  among \nprograms depending on their cost-recovery prospects. Tuition fees for regular nonquota courses \nshould  be  equivalent  to  those  charged  for  special  courses,  which  should  cease  to  exist  as  a \nseparate  concept  or  category  by  2015.  In  addition,  the  Government  will  promulgate  decrees  for \nimplementation in 2011 to introduce (i) a revised and increased dormitory fee for regular nonquota \nstudents; and (ii) improved benefit structure for staff of public HEIs. \n  \n\nc. \n\nEnhanced Governance Systems for Public and Private HEIs \n\n \nTo strengthen the governance capacity at public universities, the Project will support the \n35. \nestablishment of clearly defined governance and management structures at each university. A \nuniversity  council,  similar  to  the  one  established  at  NUOL,  will  be  established  at  CU  and  SU. \nMembership  in  university  councils  will  include  30%  representation  from  outside  the  university, \nincluding  local  government,  private  sector,  and  cultural  and  related  social  sectors  by  2013.  At \nleast 40% of council members will be women by 2014. The Project will assist in developing and \nstrengthening the role of the university president by proposing that in future the role be filled by \na  competitive  recruitment  process,  subject  to  final  approval  by  MOE  and  the  Prime  Minister\u2019s \noffice.  The  Project  will  provide  short-  and  long-term  training,  as  well  as  ongoing  capacity \nbuilding  for  administration  staff  of  NUOL,  CU,  and  SU;  and  provide  related  facilities  at  CU.  At \nleast 30% of staff or faculty members trained will be women. \n \nThe  Government  will  encourage  the  expansion  of  private  HEIs,  to  relieve  some  of  the \n36. \nburden  of  financing  higher  education  from  limited  government  financial  resources;  this  will \nabsorb  excess  demand  for  higher  education.  However,  the  Government  must  maintain  a \nrigorous  oversight  role  with  regard  to  accreditation  and  monitoring  of  quality  and  relevance  of \nprivate  HEIs.  The  Project  will  lay  the  foundations  for  the  eventual  unified  regulation  and \nsupervision  of  public  and  private  HEIs.  The  Project  will  assess  viable  options  based  on \ninternational  best  practice,  and  assist  MOE  in  developing  (i)  policy  and  regulatory  systems \n(including  mechanisms  for  monitoring)  for  higher  education subsector,  (ii)  accreditation  criteria \nto be applied to private HEIs, and (iii) a quality auditing system. \n \n\n2. \n\nOutput 2: Enhanced Relevance and Capacity for Quality Improvement  \n\n \nThe  Project  will  support  the  following  suboutputs  (i)  enhanced  relevance  of  courses, \n37. \ncurriculum, and teaching materials; (ii) strengthened quality assurance, accreditation, and credit \nsystem;  (iii)  enhanced \nfaculty;  \n(iv) \nlearning  environment;  and  (v)  strengthened  regional  and \ninternational dimensions. \n \n\nteaching  and  research  capacities  of  public  university \n\nteaching  and \n\nimproved \n\na. \n\nEnhanced  Relevance  of  Courses,  Curriculum,  and  Teaching \nMaterials \n\n \nThe  Project  will  support  initial  tracer  studies  to  collect  benchmark  information  on \n38. \ngraduates and monitor their performance in the labor market, particularly for CU and SU, which \nrecently  produced  graduates  with  diploma  and  bachelor  degrees  for  the  first  time  since  their \n\n10 \n\n \n\n\festablishment.  Throughout  the  Project,  periodic  tracer  studies  will  be  undertaken  to  inform \nfuture development of all public and private HEIs, particularly the mix of faculties and courses to \nbe offered by the respective universities and the number of places offered within each faculty. \nThe  Project will  explore  and  develop  new  courses  to  reflect  labor  market  survey  results  and \nrecommendations  under  the  PPTA  for  the  Strengthening  Technical  Vocational  Education  and \nTraining  Project  (footnote  13).  Furthermore,  to  ensure  external  efficiency,  the  Project  will  help \npublic  universities  establish  alumni  associations,  and  introduce  career  orientation  and \ncounseling programs starting early in a student's course of study. It will also support expanded \ndialogue  between  universities  and  local  employers  to  better  align  curriculum  and  pedagogical \napproaches with labor market needs. \n \n39.  \nIn  connection  with  NESRS  implementation,  the  Project  will  support  the  reform  of \nundergraduate  curriculum  content  by  developing  interdisciplinary  common-core  courses  and \nassociated textbooks to be offered throughout different faculties of the three public universities, \nas  well  as  faculty-specific  curricula  and  lecture  textbooks  and  materials.  The  introduction  of \ncommon core courses will bring substantial efficiency gains and cost savings for all participating \nfaculties.  The  Project  will  include  curriculum  development  workshops  and  international  study \nvisits,  where  academic  staff  will  be  trained  to  enhance  their  skills  in  contemporary  curriculum \ndesign,  development  of  a  curriculum  framework  for  each  of  their  respective  faculties,  and  the \nuse of the revised and/or updated curriculum. At least 30% of staff or faculty members will be \nwomen  trained  in  curriculum  development  and  assessment.  Faculty-based  staff  will  then \ncontinue  to  develop  faculty-specific  lecture  materials  with  associated  delivery  strategies.  The \nProject  will  support  development  and/or  updating,  printing,  and  distribution  of  textbooks  and \nlearning materials in the Lao language for approximately 15 subjects, prioritizing new materials \ndeveloped for interdisciplinary common-core courses and bridging programs for disadvantaged \nstudents with weaker academic backgrounds.  \n \n\nb. \n\nStrengthened Quality Assurance, Accreditation, and Credit System \n\n \n40.  \nThe  strengthened  QAC  at  MOE  will  be  mandated  as  the  key  accrediting  body  for \neducation  programs  in  the  Lao  PDR.  With  support  from  the  Project,  DHE  will  cooperate  with \nQAC  to  strengthen  quality  assurance,  accreditation,  credit  systems  for  higher  education,  and \nrecognition  of  degrees  and  qualifications  in  accordance  with  international  standards  for  higher \neducation.  DHE  will  coordinate  with  QAC  in  developing  university  admission  standards  and \nbuilding  capacity  in  the  universities  to  set  up  entrance  examinations.  The  Project  will  provide \nadvisory services, training, and necessary equipment to support capacity building of QAC. The \nProject will also help QAC and universities to develop systematic and fully standardized course \ncredit  systems,  which  will  facilitate  student  transfer  between  public  and  private  HEIs,  TVET \ngraduates'  access  to  higher  education  opportunities,  and  employers'  assessment  of  degree \nholders' qualifications.  \n \n\nc. \n\nEnhanced Teaching and Research Capacities  \n\n \n41.  \nThe  Project  will  support  the  establishment  of  a  central  professional  development  unit \n(PDU) under DHE, which will be located at NUOL and linked to outreach PDUs established at \nCU  and  SU.  The  PDU  staff  will  be  seconded  from  DHE  and  NUOL  during  and  beyond  the \nproject  period  without  involving  any  additional  staff  salaries.  The  Project  will  provide \ninternational master\u2019s and doctoral degree programs comprising approximately 40 and 20 staff \nand faculty members respectively in three annual batches (approximately 10 for NUOL, 30 for \nCU,  and  20  for  SU  in  total),  as  well  as  80  staff  and  faculty  members  for  in-country  master\u2019s \nprograms. In addition, the Project will provide international study tours and training programs for \n40  staff  and  faculty  members,  as  well  as  a  large  number  of  in-country  short-term  staff  and \n\n11 \n\n \n\n\flinkage,  and \n\nfaculty  development  programs.  A  merit-based  and  transparent  selection  process  will  be \ndeveloped by the PDUs for staff and faculty to undertake international study or attend in-country \nactivities. Females will comprise 50% of all staff and faculty to be trained. To assess the efficacy \nof  staff  and  faculty  development  programs,  participant  feedback  methodologies  including \npostactivity  assessment  will  be  utilized.  The  Project  will  include  provisions  to  invite  foreign \nscholars  and/or  professionals  to  give  advice  on  academic  program  development  and  review, \nteaching  support,  e-learning  approaches,  university\u2013industry \nresearch \nmethodology  and  publication.  Foreign  scholars  will  foster  the  long-term  relationships  between \nforeign and Lao universities. The Project, through QAC and the central PDU, will develop and \nimplement an induction program for all new academic staff. The staff and faculty development \nstrategies and plan are in Supplementary Appendix A. \n \nAs  an  integral  part  of  international  degree  programs  for  staff  and  faculty  members,  the \n42. \nProject  will  pilot  a  matching  scholarship  grant  scheme  with  50:50  matching  between  the  project \nand  partner  universities,  which  include  any  suitable  foreign  universities  willing  to  provide \npostgraduate (master\u2019s and doctoral) degree program scholarships for staff and faculty members \nof  the  three  public  universities.  This  scheme  is  expected  to  significantly  expand  the  number  of \nscholarships  to  be  offered  under  the  Project.  Females  will  comprise  at  least  50%  of  the  pilot \nmatching scholarship program. The PDU will be responsible for finalizing selection criteria for the \nmatching  scholarship  scheme,  assisting  participating  Lao  universities  in  identifying  international \npartner  universities,  monitoring  the  implementation  and  results,  and  preparing  an  evaluation.15 \nStaff benefiting from scholarships or grants will be required to sign a bond. The fund flow diagram \nfor a matching scholarship grant scheme is in Supplementary Appendix B. \n \nThe Project will support the promotion of research capacity of faculty members of public \n43. \nuniversities.  The  NUOL  Research  Coordination  Committee  will  be  upgraded  to  a  national \nresearch  center  to  help  the  university  faculties  at  NUOL,  CU,  and  SU  formulate  proposals  for \nresearch  grants  to  the  Government  and  a  range  of  funding  agencies,  including  the  private \nsector.  The  Project  will  develop  a  training  scheme  to  improve  the  publication  writing  skills  of \nacademic  staff  and  to  devise  course  modules  on  academic  research  skills  development  for \ninclusion  in  undergraduate  and  graduate  programs,  through  consulting  services  and  well-\nestablished academic publishing companies.  \n \n\nd. \n\nImproved Teaching and Learning Environment  \n\n \n44. \nTo improve the teaching and learning environment and in accordance with the NESRS, \nwhich  places  high  priority  on  the  development  of  e-libraries,  the  Project  will  support  the \nestablishment and development of ICT-based teaching and learning centers at NUOL, CU, and \nSU,  rather  than  focusing  investment  on  the  development  of  traditional  libraries,  or  financing \nprocurement of discrete packages of information technology systems. Each learning center will \ntypically  have  about  100\u2013200  networked  computers  with  internet  access.  It  will  enable  the \ncreation  of  an  e-resource  centre  or  e-library  (including  access  to  computers  with  high-speed \ninternet,  access  to  e-reference  and  journals,  and  an  on-line  network  linking  the  three  public \nuniversities  and  DHE)  where  students  and  staff  are  able  to  access  up-to-date  and  extensive \nmaterials, bypassing the need for development of a traditional library. Effectiveness of student \nlearning activities will be greatly enhanced, as the network can be used for writing assignments, \nresearching information from the internet, pursuing distance study programs, accessing course \nmaterials,  accessing  references  available  on-line,  submitting  assignments  by  email,  and \n\n                                                 \n15  During  the  PPTA,  several  universities  in  Australia,  Japan,  Republic  of  Korea,  Thailand,  and  Viet  Nam  confirmed \n\ntheir participation in the scheme and pledged initial total contributions of approximately $1 million equivalent.  \n\n12 \n\n \n\n\fcommunicating  with  lecturers.  Upon  establishment  of  the  ICT-based  teaching  and  learning \ncenters  during  the  second  year  of  project  implementation,  a  related  ICT  package  will  be \nprocured  as  a  4-year  leasing  contract  that  provides  for  the  replacement  of  computers  on  a  2-\nyear cycle, including technical and pedagogical support by suppliers.  \n \n45. \nTo improve and upgrade the teaching and learning environment at CU, the Project will \nsupport  development  of  the  campus  and  facilities.  Project  support  will  focus  on  fully  and \nintensively utilizing the current 66 hectare campus. The Project will develop basic infrastructure \nsuch  as  road,  water,  and  power  supply  systems.  The  Project  will  also  develop  facilities, \n(including  civil  works,  equipment,  and  furniture),  one  multipurpose  central  building  for  the \nestablishment of the ICT-based teaching and learning center, two faculty and department office \nblocks, two faculty housing blocks, one science laboratory building with equipment (for physics, \nbiology,  and  chemistry),  and  one  auditorium-conference  hall.  This  concentrated  approach  for \ncampus  and  facilities  development  will  minimize  implications  for  operation  and  maintenance \nrelated costs and environmental impacts. \n \n\ne. \n\nStrengthened Regional and International Links \n\n \n46. \nThe Project will expand and strengthen academic and student exchange programs with \nneighboring countries, and support MOE to strengthen its cooperation with the Southeast Asia \nMinisters of Education Organization (SEAMEO), in particular the SEAMEO-Regional Center for \nHigher  Education  and  Development,  and  other  existing  similar  networks.  The  Project  will \nencourage female participation in such international exchange programs, whereby at least 50% \nof faculty members or students will be women. Once the standardized credit transfer system is \ninstituted,  the  Project  will  strengthen  the  capacity  of  Lao  universities  to  expand  student \nexchange  relationships  with  universities  in  neighboring  countries.  In  addition,  the  Project  will \nhelp each of the three public universities to identify two to three international twinning programs, \nand  reach  agreements  with  foreign  universities.  Furthermore,  the  Project  will  provide  advisory \nservices  through  visiting  scholars  and/or  professionals  to  promote  existing  and  new  academic \nexchange  agreements.  Universities  will  be  encouraged  to  seek  relationships  with  quality, \ncommercially oriented international professional training organizations by financing membership \nfees. Academic and student exchange programs and international partnerships must be subject \nto effectiveness review.  \n \n\n3. \n\nOutput 3: Increased Equity and Access in Higher Education \n\n \n47.   Output  3  includes  (i)  improved  targeted  selection  criteria  and  procedures  for  quota \nstudents, and (ii) increased enrollment capacity at CU.  \n \n\na. \n\nImproved  Targeted  Selection  Criteria  and  Procedures  for  Quota \nStudents \n\n \n48. \nThe  Project  will  support  the  reform  of  the  admission  system.  The  percentage  of  quota \nstudents (who are exempted from fees and provided with living allowances) will be reduced from \nroughly 50% to 20% in a phased manner from 2011 to 2015 to enable more effective targeting \nto  ensure  that  the  most  disadvantaged  candidates  are  identified  to  receive  increased  support. \nMany  of  the  current  quota  students  are  not  poor  and  disadvantaged  students  from  ethnic \ngroups. Instead, the quota system  benefits students from  affluent families who can pay tuition \nand  other  fees.  The  Project  will  support  the  high-level  task  force  on  student  admission  to  be \nlocated at MOE by providing its operating costs, and establishing standardized criteria for quota \nstudents  (giving  priority  to  female  students  from  ethnic  groups).  Task  force  membership \ncomprises  director  generals  of  DHE,  MOE's  departments  of  finance  and  personnel;  and \n\n13 \n\n \n\n\funiversity  presidents  concerned.  Appropriate  advisory  support  with  regard  to  choice  of  study \nprograms  for  quota  students  will  be  incorporated  in  the  selection  process;  currently  this  is  a \ncritical constraint to success of the quota system. In addition, the Project will develop pre-entry \nskills tests to more accurately assess the competency of quota students. Students not meeting \nthe  required  minimum  entry  standards  will  be  required  to  undertake  a  purpose-designed \nacademic skills upgrading program, to help them reach the academic standard required to gain \nentry to a 1st year degree or diploma program.  \n \n\nb. \n\nIncreased Enrollment Capacity at Champasak University \n\n \n49. \nThe  Project  will  provide  a  foundation  for  incremental  expansion  of  enrollment  and \nprograms  by  enhancing  CU's  enrollment  capacity.  To  fill  the  gap  between  the  university\u2019s \nexpected enrollment growth and admission capacity, the Project will provide (i) five multipurpose \nbuildings with furniture, each comprising 12 classrooms (a total of 60 classrooms); (ii) two student \ndormitories  with  furniture  (female  and  male),  each  accommodating  300  students;  and  (iii)  six \nseparate  female  and  male  toilet  and  washroom  facility  blocks.  The  additional  classroom  places \ncreated can absorb students graduating from upper secondary education who at present need to \nseek jobs or enroll in technical and vocational institutions for tertiary education. Special attention \n(e.g.,  boarding  fee  exemption)  will  be  given  to  poor  and  female  students  of  ethnic  origins  in \navailing of the expanded student dormitories. By 2015, females will comprise 50% of CU students. \n \n\n4. \n\nOutput 4: Effective Project Management and Implementation  \n\nTo \n\nimplementation, \n\nSpecial Features  \n\nfacilitate  project  management  and \n\n \n50. \nthe  Project  will  provide \nequipment, vehicles, and other necessary materials and furniture for DHE and CU, as well as a \ncore  package  of  equipment  for  NUOL  and  SU.  The  Project  will  also  provide  a  package  of \ninternational  and  national  consultants  (including  administrative  assistants  and  accounts  on  a \nneed basis), who will help DHE and participating three public universities implement the Project \nin a timely fashion and with good quality results. \n \nC. \n \n51. \nICT  Teaching  and  Learning  Centers,  and  ICT  Leasing.  The  Project  will  develop \nmultipurpose,  ICT-based  teacher  and  learning  centers  and  their  network  at  each  of  the  three \npublic  universities, rather than focusing investment on the development of traditional  libraries or \nfinancing procurement of discrete packages of information technology systems. The ICT teaching \nand learning center is regarded as an effective and efficient way to raise the standards of teaching \nand learning in the universities. Maintenance and technical support will be provided on an on-call \nbasis.  High-speed  and  high-quality  internet  access  will  be  provided  on  a  continuous  basis.  The \nselected supplier will customize a platform for use by the universities, and provide technical and \npedagogical  support  by  supplying  technicians  and  experts  in  e-learning  over  a  specified  period \nuntil university staff develop sufficient skills to operate the system independently. In the NESRS, \nthe  Government  identifies  the  development  of  e-libraries  as  a  priority.  In  addition,  the  Project \nincludes measures to increase cost-recovery such as introducing tuition fees for regular nonquota \ncourses, charging dormitory fees, and promoting other income-generation activities. The Project \nwill help MOE and the universities formulate budgetary plans to sustainably finance operation and \nmaintenance, and periodic upgrading of ICT resources after project completion. These plans will \ninclude  allocating  a  portion  of  increased  university  revenues  from  enhanced  cost-recovery \nmeasures  introduced  under  the  Project.  MOE  and  participating  universities  will  seek  internet \nproviders that can offer low-cost services to education institutions.  \n \n\n14 \n\n \n\n\fQuality Assurance, Accreditation, and Recognition. The Project will develop a national \n52. \nsystem  of  quality  assurance  and  accreditation  (currently  lacking  due  to  inadequate  funding  and \nhuman  resources),  including  helping  MOE  develop  a  quality  audit  manual.  Development  of  this \nsystem  will  involve  close  dialogue  and  cooperation  with  the  central  QAC  as  well  as  the \nAssociation of Southeast Asian Nations University Network Quality Assurance. It will be supported \nby  consulting  services  provided  under  the  Project  and  technical  dialogue  with  the  Asia-Pacific \nQuality  Network  and  SEAMEO-Regional  Center  for  Higher  Education  and  Development.  An \noutreach QAC office will be maintained within each of the three public universities. \n \n53.  Matching  Scholarship  Grant Scheme. The Project will pilot a new scheme of matching \nscholarship grants (50:50 matching between the Project and partner universities), as an initiative \nin public\u2013private partnership. For this purpose, the Project's $2 million grant will be matched with a \n$2  million  equivalent  scholarship  grant  from  any  partner  universities.  Partner  universities  will  be \nany public and private foreign universities willing to provide master degree program scholarships \nto administrative or academic staff of the three public universities. The project fund can be directly \nmatched with contributions from partner universities or channeled through intermediary agencies \nthat  help  PDUs  coordinate  with  partner  universities.  This  scheme  is  expected  to  significantly \nincrease the number and amount of scholarships offered under the Project. The central PDU at \nNUOL  will  be  responsible  for  finalizing  selection  criteria  for  the  matching  scholarship  grant \nscheme, and will assist participating universities in identifying partner universities.  \n  \nD. \n \n54. \nThe  project  investment  cost  is  estimated  at  $28.8  million,  including  physical  and  price \ncontingencies, taxes, and duties of $1.6 million to be financed by the Government (Table 1, and \nAppendix  4).  The  foreign  exchange  cost  is  $17.2  million,  or  60%  of  the  total  cost.  The  local \ncurrency cost, including taxes and duties, is $11.6 million equivalent, or 40% of the total cost. \n \nE. \n \n55. \nADB will provide a grant of $24,800,000 from its Special Funds resources to cover 86% \nof the project cost. For the balance of $4.00 million, the Government will finance $2.00 million \n(7.0% of the project cost), while partner foreign universities will cover $2.00 million, or 7.0% of \nthe project cost (Table 2, and Appendix 4).  \n \n\nProject Investment Plan  \n\nFinancing Plan \n\nTable 1: Tentative Project Investment Plan ($ million) \n\nItem \n\nA. \n\n \nBase Costb \n1.

MOE  will  be  the  Executing  Agency.  A  project  steering  committee  will  provide  overall \nguidance  to  the  Project  and  support  cross-agency  policy  dialogue.  The  MOE  vice  minister  in \ncharge of higher education will chair the committee, which will comprise representatives of MOE \nand  the  three  concerned  public  universities,  as  well  as  representatives  from  the  Ministry  of \nFinance,  Ministry  of  Foreign  Affairs,  Ministry  of  Planning  and  Investment,  and  Office  of  the \nPrime Minister. Within DHE, a (i) project coordination unit headed by the DHE director general, \nas project director, will be established to facilitate policy dialogue across MOE departments and \nthe participating universities and supervise and oversee project implementation; and (ii) a DHE \nproject  implementation  unit  (D-PIU)  headed  by  the  DHE  deputy  director  general,  as  project \nmanager,  will  be  established  to  implement  and  supervise  central  project  activities  including \nconsolidation of project reporting and review of withdrawal applications for endorsement by the \nMOE's  Department  of  Finance.  MOE  departments  and  institutions  will  be  responsible  for \nactivities that fall within their area of responsibility. PIUs will be established in each participating \nuniversity (NUOL, CU and SU), headed by the respective universities' vice presidents as project \nmanagers  to  coordinate  with  the  D-PIU  and  concerned  provincial  authorities  in  implementing \nand  supervising  the  Project,  including  procurement  activities,  monitoring,  and  reporting.  The \nproject management structure is in Appendix 5. To implement the staff and faculty development \nstrategies and plan, a PDU will be established under DHE, which will be located at NUOL, and \nlinked to outreach PDUs established at CU and SU and D-PIU. The MOE vice minister and DHE \ndirector  general,  together  with  the  Center  for  Integrated  Education  (formerly  the  Gender  and \nEthnic Groups Education Unit), will be responsible for overseeing implementation of the gender \nand ethnic groups action plan.  \n   \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Period \n\n \n57. \nThe Project will be implemented over 6 years from January 2010 to December 2015, to \nbe  consistent  with  the  final  target  year  of  the  ESDF,  2009\u20132015.  Both  central  and  provincial \ngovernment authorities have assured that adequate budgetary provision for the Project will be \nincluded  in  the  fiscal  years  from  2009/10  to  2015/16.  The  implementation  schedule  is  in \nAppendix 6.  \n  \n\n3. \n\nProcurement \n\n \n58.   All  procurement  to  be  financed  under  the  ADB  grant  will  be  carried  out  in  accordance \nwith  ADB\u2019s Procurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as amended  from  time  to  time).  The  D-PIU  will  be \nresponsible for all procurement, except for civil works, equipment, furniture, and vehicles at CU, \nwhich will be done by the CU PIU, in close consultation with the D-PIU. Procurement of goods \n\n16 \n\n \n\n \nF. \n \n\n \n\n\fsuch  as  computers  and  laboratory  equipment  will  use  international  competitive  bidding \nprocedures if more than $1.0 million; national competitive bidding if $1 million or less, but more \nthan  $100,000  equivalent;  or  shopping  if  less  than  $100,000  equivalent.  Civil  works  will  use \ninternational  competitive  bidding  if  more  than  $2.0  million;  and  national  competitive  bidding  if \nless  than  $2  million,  but  more  than  $100,000.  Prior  review  will  be  used  in  the  procurement \nprocesses. The procurement plan, including indicative procurement packages, is in Appendix 7. \n \n\n4. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n \n59.  \nThe Project will be supported by consultant services mobilized via three modalities. First, \nthe Project will engage a firm to provide 220 person-months of consulting services (95 person-\nmonths  international  and  125  person-months  national),  which  will  be  selected  using  the \nsimplified technical proposal and quality- and cost-based selection method, in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). The quality- \nand  cost-based  selection  weighting  will  follow  the  standard  quality-cost  ratio  of  80:20.  This \npackage  of  consulting  services  will  provide  technical  support  for  the  Project  as  well  as  build \nlonger-term  local  capacities  for  planning,  management,  research,  and  delivery  of  higher \neducation.  Consulting  services  will  span  a  broad  array  of  expertise,  including  (i)  strategic \nplanning,  project  management,  and  monitoring;  (ii)  governance  and  management  of  higher \neducation; (iii) higher education financing; (iv) higher education quality assurance; (v) curriculum \nand textbook development; (vi) human resources and professional development; (vii) research \ncapacity building; (viii) ICT-based teaching and learning; (ix) higher education MIS development; \n(x)  campus  and  facilities  development,  and  equipment  improvement;  (xi)  gender  and  social \ndevelopment;  (xii)  environment;  (xiii)  procurement;  and  (xiv)  project  financial  management.  In \naddition  to  the  firm  that  will  augment  consulting  services  in  specific  and  needs-tailored  areas, \ninternational scholars and/or professionals (a total of 70 person-months) will be invited as short-\nterm  consultants  on  an  individual  basis  to  assist  participating  universities  in  developing \nacademic  and  research  programs  and  in  teaching  support.  The  Project  will  also  locally  recruit \nadministrative  assistants  and  accountants  on  an  individual  basis  as  needed  to  help  the  PIUs \nwith project administration, accounting, and other tasks including reporting. The outline terms of \nreference  for  consultants  are  in  Supplementary  Appendix  C.  Any  assets  purchased  will  be \nprocured using ADB's Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time), and upon \ncompletion of the Project, will be turned over to MOE.  \n \n \n \nThe  Project  will  provide  international  master\u2019s  and  doctoral  degree  programs  and  in-\n60.  \ncountry  master\u2019s  degree  programs  for  DHE  staff,  and  staff  and  faculty  of  the  three  public \nuniversities (NUOL, CU, and SU). In addition, the Project will provide international study tours and \ntraining  programs  for  staff  and  faculty  members,  as  well  as  a  large  number  of  in-country  short-\nterm  staff  and  faculty  development  programs.  The  PDU,  in  coordination  with  outreach  PDUs  at \nCU  and  SU  and  D-PIU,  will  select  the  candidates  for  staff  and  faculty  development  programs \n(including  the  matching  scholarship  grant  scheme)  based  on  the  merit-based  and  transparent \nselection criteria and process to be developed by the PDUs for Lao staff and faculty members to \nundertake international study or attend in-country activities. Staff benefiting from scholarships or \ngrants for postgraduate degree programs will be required to sign a bond. The Project will execute \nagreements  with  all  candidates  receiving  scholarships  or  grants  for  undertaking  foreign \npostgraduate  degrees  and  local  master\u2019s  degrees  to  ensure  that  scholarship  recipients  will \ncontinue working with the same ministry or institution for at least 5 years after completing a foreign \ndegree  or  local  master\u2019s  degree  program.  The  scholarship  summary  and  indicative  selection \ncriteria are in Appendix 8.  \n \n\nStaff and Faculty Development \n\n5. \n\n \n\n17 \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n7. \n\n6. \n\nAdvance Action \n\nAnticorruption Policy \n\n \n \n61. \nOne  package  of  consulting  services  will  be  selected  using  advance  recruitment  action. \nMOE will carry out advance action for recruiting consulting services up to the stage of evaluating \ntechnical and financial proposals. MOE may not sign the contract with the winning firm before \nthe financing agreement becomes effective. ADB's support of advance action does not commit \nADB to approve the Project or to finance the recruitment costs.  \n \n \n \n62. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  Government  and  MOE.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance, \naccountability,  and  transparency,  ADB  reserves  the  right  to  investigate,  directly  or  through  its \nagents,  any  alleged  corrupt,  fraudulent,  collusive,  or  coercive  practices  relating  to  the  Project. \nTo support these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the \ngrant regulations and the bidding documents for the Project. In particular, all contracts financed \nby  ADB  in  connection  with  the  Project  shall  include  provisions  specifying  the  right  of  ADB  to \naudit  and  examine  the  records  and  accounts  of  the  Executing  Agency  and  all  contractors, \nsuppliers, consultants, and other service providers as they relate to the Project. \n \n63. \nIn  addition  to  the  standard  ADB  requirements  to  deter  corruption  and  increase \ntransparency,  the  Government  will  be  required  to  disclose  information  about  various  project \nmatters,  including  procurement  related  to  the  Project,  on  MOE's  website.  With  regard  to \nprocurement, the website will include a list of participating bidders, names of the winning bidder, \nbasic  details  on  bidding  procedures  adopted,  amount  of  contracts  awarded,  and  list  of  goods \nand  services  procured.  Information  regarding  the  partner  universities  in  the  matching \nscholarship  grant  scheme  will  be  posted  on  the  website.  A  grievance  redresses  body  will  be \nestablished  at  MOE,  NUOL,  CU,  and  SU  to  (i)  review  and  address  grievances  of  project \nstakeholders,  or  any  person  responsible  for  carrying  out  the  Project;  and  (ii)  set  the  threshold \ncriteria and procedures for handling such grievances, for proactively responding to them, and for \nproviding the stakeholders with notice of the chosen mechanism/action. \n \n \n \n64.   MOE will establish an imprest account for the Project in dollars at the Bank of Lao DPR. \nThe advance to the imprest account will be no more than a 6-month projected disbursement to \nbe financed through the imprest account or 10% of the grant amount, whichever is lower. The \nimprest  account  will  be  established,  managed,  and  liquidated  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Loan \nDisbursement  Handbook  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  Statement  of  expenditure \nprocedures  may  be  used  to  reimburse  contracts  not  exceeding  $50,000  per  payment  and  to \nliquidate  advances  made  into  the  imprest  account  in  accordance  with  the  grant's  financial \ncovenants. MOE and the Ministry of Finance will coordinate the timely release of funds.  \n \n \n \n65.  MOE, on behalf of the Government, will maintain separate records and accounts for the \nProject  to  identify  goods  and  services  financed  from  the  grant  proceeds.  All  project  accounts \nincluding  financial  statements  will  be  audited  annually  as  part  of  the  regular  audit  by  the \nNational  Audit  Authority,  using  international  accounting  and  auditing  standards  in  accordance \nwith  the  provisions  of  the  grant  agreement.  The  auditor's  report  and  copies  of  the  certified \naccounts  and  related  financial  statements,  including  auditor's  opinion  on  the  use  of  grant \nproceeds,  and  compliance  with  grant  covenants,  will  be  submitted  to  ADB  no  later  than  6 \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n9. \n\n8. \n\n \n\n18 \n\n \n\n\f \n\n10. \n\nProject Performance, Monitoring, and Evaluation. \n\nmonths after the close of each fiscal year in English language. A separate audit opinion will be \nissued on the use of the imprest account and statement of expenditure procedures. \n \n66.   DHE  will  prepare  quarterly  reports  on  project  implementation  and  submit  them  to  ADB \nwithin 30 days of each quarter. The reports will be submitted in a format acceptable to ADB and \ninclude progress made against established targets, problems encountered during the previous \nquarter,  steps  taken  to  resolve  disputes  and  problems,  compliance  with  grant  covenants,  and \nproposed project activities for the succeeding quarter. Within 3 months after physical completion \nof the Project, MOE will submit to ADB a project completion report providing details of project \nimplementation and accomplishments. \n \n \n \n67.  MOE  will  monitor  project  achievements  to  evaluate  implementation  and  development \nimpacts  at  various  stages  of  the  project  cycle.  The  higher  education  master  plan,  2010\u20132020, \nunder preparation, will develop a higher education development monitoring framework using the \nresult-based  monitoring  indicators  in  accordance  with  the  ESDF  targets.  The  project \nperformance  monitoring  will  focus  on  assessing  the  degree  of  fulfillment  in  the  monitoring \nindicators  to  be  developed  under  the  higher  education  master  plan.  The  project  performance, \nmonitoring,  and  evaluation  system  will  be  based  on  the  gender  targets  and  indicators  in  the \ndesign and monitoring framework, and gender and ethnic groups action plan, as well as other \nsex-disaggregated data and analysis. \n \n \n \nThe  Government  and  ADB  will  conduct  semiannual  reviews  of  the  Project.  The  reviews \n68.  \nwill  assess  progress  in  each  output  area,  identify  difficulties  or  constraints,  and  help  determine \nways to overcome them. The Government and ADB will jointly undertake a midterm review of the \nProject in the last quarter of year 3 of project implementation. The midterm review will (i) assess \nproject  performance  against  targets  and  benchmarks,  (ii)  identify  and  recommend  necessary \nchanges in the project design and implementation arrangements, and (iii) review compliance with \ngrant  covenants.  It  will  inform  planning  for  the  second  half  of  the  Project.  The  findings  will  be \ndiscussed  at  the  midterm  seminar  to  be  attended  by  MOE  leadership  and  senior  staff, \nrepresentatives of government ministries and agencies concerned, the consultants, and ADB.  \n \n\nProject Review \n\n11. \n\n \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\nExpected Benefits and Impacts \n\n \nA. \n \n69. \nDirect  Beneficiaries.  The  direct  beneficiaries  will  be  the  nearly  400,000  university \ngraduates of the improved and expanded higher education system, including 300,000 at NUOL, \n53,000 in CU, and 47,000 at SU. The benefits will primarily accrue from increased quality and \nexpanded classroom and dormitory space. The Project will support a 25% increase in academic \nstaff with postgraduate degrees from 538 to 678. The university system will be linked by intranet \nproviding  access  for  e-learning  and  internet  for  all  students,  with  ICT  investments  including \nincreasing the number of terminals at CU plus NUOL from 170 to 500 and adding an additional \n200  terminals  at  NUOL.  CU  will  receive  60  new  classrooms,  one  laboratory  building  with  12 \nrooms, and 30 dormitory rooms for 600 students, increasing dormitory capacity from 200 to 800 \nstudents.  Other  facilities  include  an  auditorium  and  conference  center,  e-learning  and  student \ncenter, faculty and administrative offices, water supply, faculty housing, and toilet and washing \nfacilities for females and males on campus. Segregated toilets and washing facilities for males \nand  females  will  be  built  in  the  dorm  area  at  CU.  Offices,  housing,  and  dormitories  will  be \n\n19 \n\n \n\n\ffurnished. The Project will print and distribute textbooks covering 15 titles for 50,000 students. \nThe  textbooks  will  be  loaned  to  the  students  and  returned  each  year.  The  current  50%  quota \nscholarships reach few of the disadvantaged and poor; the amount fails to cover student living \nexpenses.  Reducing  the  quota  to  20%  and  increasing  the  living  expense  allowance  with \ntransparent targeting will enable uptake by disadvantaged ethnic groups and women selected. \n \n70. \nEconomic Benefits. By improving access to and particularly the quality and relevance of \nhigher education, the Project will have important economic benefits for individuals and the overall \neconomy. Particularly in economies characterized by rapid growth and transformation, completion \nof  higher  education  is  associated  with  higher  individual  wages  as  well  as  enhanced  capacity  to \nrespond to new economic opportunities in emerging modern sectors. The country\u2019s rapid growth \nand  economic  transformation  has  meant  that  demand  for  human  capital  has  outstripped  the \nsupply  of  tertiary  education  graduates,  resulting  in  a  wage  premium  for  graduates  from  higher \nversus  secondary  education.  Investments  in  expanding  the  enrollment  capacity  at  CU  will \nincrease the number of higher education graduates flowing into the labor market annually, while \nthe impact of improved quality and relevance of education will enhance the labor market returns to \ngraduates  of  all  three  universities.  The  Project's  economic  internal  rate  of  return  of  18%  was \ncalculated  using  very  conservative  assumptions.16 Increasing  project  cost  or  decreasing  project \nbenefit by 10% yields little change. Postponing project benefits by 1 year reduces the economic \ninternal rate of return to 13% (Supplementary Appendix D). \n \n71. \nThe  Project  supports  long-term  and  sustainable  poverty  reduction.  Currently,  the  thin \nlayer  of  highly  educated  young  adults\u2014less  than  1%  of  the  labor  force\u2014detracts  from  the \ncountry\u2019s  ability  to  attract  foreign  direct  investment.  Foreign  direct  investment  based  on  low \nwages alone does not lead to sustainable poverty reduction, therefore labor productivity must be \nincreased to penetrate higher-value-added sectors. The National Growth and Poverty Reduction \nStrategy notes the need to increase the proportion of university and vocational school graduates \nto  ensure  sustainability.  In  addition  to  enhancing  the  efficiency  of  state  funding  for  education \nand  supporting  increased  education  access,  relevance,  and  quality  in  the  public  university \nsystem, the Project will strengthen the regulatory environment and quality assurance for private \nhigher education, magnifying its short- and longer-term economic impacts. The enhanced cost \nrecovery  and  other  reforms  promoted  under  the  Project  will  have  important  indirect  economic \nbenefits by improving sustainability of the entire education system, including basic education.  \n \n72. \nIn  the  context  of  increasing  demand  for  rapid  expansion  of  higher  education  systems, \nquality,  equity,  and  sustainable  financing  of  the  expanded  system  can  become  a  concern, \nparticularly  in  low-income  developing  member  countries  such  as  the  Lao  PDR.  The  Project  is \nstrategically designed to support the Government to pursue, in a step-by-step manageable and \ncomprehensive  way,  the  expanded  and  improved  higher  education  system.  The  Project's \nstrategic approach aims to help minimize the risk of quantitative expansion of higher education \nundermining  quality  and  equity  in  higher  education.  Through  cost-recovery,  cost-sharing,  and \npartnership measures, it also aims to minimize the risk of increased higher education financing \neroding public financing for lower education subsectors, such as basic education. The economic \nand financial sustainability analysis is in Appendix 9. \n \n73. \nSocial  and  Gender  Benefits. A poverty and social assessment was conducted during \nthe PPTA, and a summary poverty reduction and social strategy was prepared (Appendix 10). \n\n                                                 \n16  The  benefit  stream  starts  in  year  4  with  revenue  from  only  25%  of  the  graduates  and  50%  in  year  5,  taking  into \naccount male and female labor force participation and unemployment rates. The monthly wage premium for improved \nuniversity education is assumed to be $12. \n\n20 \n\n \n\n\fThe  Project  is  designed  to  benefit  the  poor,  women,  and  ethnic  groups,  especially  female \nstudents from ethnic groups, through (i) the revised student quota system to increase the ratio \nof  female  quota  students  from  ethnic  groups,  and  (ii)  the  provision  of  increased  living \nallowances  to  disadvantaged  quota  students.  In  addition,  due  to  expanded  female  dormitory \naccommodation and female amenities blocks, the number of female students enrolled at CU will \nincrease from 1,713 (35% of total enrollments) to 4,000 by 2015 (50%). Further, the Project will \nsupport at least 30% female participation in all training courses, and at least 50% in international \nexchange programs. Recruitment and training of faculty members and staff will give preference \nto  women  from  ethnic  groups.  A  gender  and  ethnic  group  analyses  and  action  plan  is  in \nAppendix 11.  \n \n74. \nInstitutional  Benefits.  DHE  and  participating  universities  will  benefit  from  the  Project \nthrough  policy  and  administrative  reform  for  higher  education.  The  Project  will  initiate  major \nefforts to improve management through institutional capacity building for DHE and participating \nuniversities,  especially  CU  and  SU.  DHE  staff  will  be  trained  to  upgrade  their  planning  and \nmanagement  skills  and  knowledge  for  overall  strategic  and  master  planning  and  policy \ndevelopment,  as  well  as  for  oversight  of  operations  of  the  higher  education  system,  including \nprivate  HEIs.  The  governance  system  and  management  capacity  at  public  universities  will  be \nstrengthened  by  establishing  clearly  defined  governance  and  management  structures  at  each \nuniversity.  For  private  HEIs,  the  regulatory  framework  and  accreditation  criteria  will  be \ndeveloped and applied. The Project will enhance capacity for data collection, management, and \nanalysis through the development of an MIS to enhance management efficiency throughout the \nhigher  education  system,  i.e.,  DHE  and  each  public  HEI.  The  academic  profile  of  the \nparticipating  universities  will  be  upgraded  by  international  and  in-country  staff  and  faculty \ndevelopment  programs,  which  will  eventually  strengthen  the  capacity  of  faculty  members  to \nintegrate teaching with research activities.  \n \n75.   Resettlement Impacts. The Project does not include any campus or site developments \nfor NUOL and SU. The campus and facilities development of CU, involving construction of basic \ncampus infrastructure and new facilities such as faculty classrooms and multipurpose buildings, \nwill be concentrated on the existing site of 66 hectares, where no households will be relocated \nand no households use agricultural land.  \n \n76. \nEnvironmental Impacts. The Project will improve water supply, power supply, drainage, \nand  sanitation  service  as  part  of  the  campus  and  facilities  development  of  CU.  The  science \nlaboratories  will  not  produce  any  industrial  hazardous  waste  as  they  will  be  used  only  for \nteaching, with minimum disposal of solid waste. However, the construction contractor must keep \nnoise and dust within locally acceptable levels, as well as manage fill, excavated material, and \nsolid  waste  in  a  way  that  does  not  create  a  permanent  impact.  During  operations,  the  water \nsupply must meet national drinking water quality standards to ensure water users are not at risk. \nMitigation and monitoring measures in the initial environmental examination (IEE) are designed \nto address these issues. The Project shows no significant adverse environmental impact and is \nassessed  as  category  B  (nonsensitive),  as  defined  in  ADB's  Environmental  Assessment \nGuidelines (2003). The IEE is in Supplementary Appendix E.  \n \nB. \n \n77. \nGovernance Risks. A primary risk for the higher education system is that the envisaged \nuniversity autonomy will not materialize fully, that it will not be accompanied by an independent \nuniversity  governance  structure  and  flexibility  in  financial  mechanisms  to  enable  public \nuniversities to reach regional standards in teaching and learning, and research. This risk may be \n\nAssumptions, Risks, and Mitigating Measures \n\n21 \n\n \n\n\fmitigated  through  (i)  the  ESDF  annual  planning  and  policy  dialogue  process,  (ii)  the  ongoing \nreview and assessment process by senior MOE officials and wider stakeholders to secure broad \nsupport  of  the  reform  agenda,  and  (iii)  advisory  support  from  ADB  and  other  development \nagencies for ongoing policy studies and related reforms.  \n \n78. \nAccountability  Risks.  A potential risk is that the newly established QAC at MOE may \nnot be able to develop accountable quality assurance and accreditation systems. This risk can \nbe mitigated by (i) appointing qualified staff at QAC; (ii) extending advisory services and training \nto support capacity building of QAC under the Project; and (iii) strengthening ongoing dialogue \nand  cooperation  between  QAC  and  the  Asia-Pacific  Quality  Network,  the  ASEAN  University \nNetwork  Quality  Assurance,  and  SEAMEO-Regional  Center  for  Higher  Education  and \nDevelopment.  \n \n79. \nPolitical  Risks.  Quota  students  are  not  charged  tuition  fees  and  receive  living \nallowances. The Project intends to restructure the quota student admission system to improve \ntargeting  of  poor  and  disadvantaged  students  so  that  overall  budget  allocation  in  the  form  of \ntuition  subsidies  and  living  allowances  will  be  more  equitable.  This  initiative  may  encounter \npolitical  difficulties  with  resistance  from  those  who  would  lose  privileges  to  enter  public \nuniversities, although most provinces have indicated their in-principle agreement to reduce the \nnumber of quota students. To mitigate this risk, the Project will support continued dialogue on \nstudent  admission  reform  between  public  university  presidents  and  concerned  provincial \nauthorities  by  strengthening  the  university  council  mechanism  and  functions,  promoting  public \ncampaign, and reducing the number of quota students in a phased manner over 6 years.  \n \nCost-Recovery  Risks.  Public  universities  may  not  be  able  to  recover  costs  of  their \n80. \noperations including salaries of their staff and faculty members and operation and maintenance \nof  the  facilities  and  equipment  under  the  Project,  such  as  ICT-based  teaching  and  learning \ncenters.  This  risk  is  mitigated  by  (i)  prime  ministerial  decree  enabling  public  universities  to \ncharge  tuition  fees  for  regular  nonquota  students  who  will  comprise  approximately  80%  of \nuniversity intakes by 2015; (ii) a phased decrease in the share of quota students exempt from \ntuition-related and dormitory fees; (iii) advisory support to increase university revenues through \nincome-generating  activities;  and  (iv)  formulation  of  budgetary  plans  to  sustainably  finance \noperation and maintenance, and periodic upgrading of ICT resources after project completion, \nwhich  will  include  allocating  a  portion  of  increased  university  revenues  from  enhanced  cost-\nrecovery measures introduced under the Project.  \n \n81.  Matching  Scholarships. Although several foreign universities have expressed interest \nin  participating  in  the  matching  grant  scholarship  scheme  with  pledged  contributions,  total \ncontributions  from  partner  foreign  universities  may  not  reach  $2  million  equivalent  in  the \nscheme.  This  risk  would  be  mitigated  by  advisory  support  to  the  PDU  in  finalizing  selection \ncriteria  for  the  matching  scholarship  scheme,  and  in  helping  participating  universities  identify \npartner  foreign  universities.  The  PDU  will  also  solicit  scholarships  from  host  institutions  of \ninternational visiting scholars to be recruited individually under the Project.  \n \n82.   Project  Implementation  Risks.  A  further  risk  may  be  represented  by  MOE\u2019s  limited \ncapacity to manage and implement new policies envisaged under the Project. The PIUs of DHE \nNUOL, CU, and SU will implement the Project based on agreed policy and planning directions. \nThis risk can be further mitigated by (i) extensive advisory  support for subsector planning and \nmanagement,  and  (ii)  consulting  services  to  facilitate  implementation  of  the  legislative  and \nregulatory framework to be developed during project implementation.  \n \n\n22 \n\n \n\n\fFinancial Sustainability \n\nC. \n \n83. \nThe sustainability of project benefits can by analyzed through two mechanisms. The first is \na  static  analysis  that  ignores  the  potential  impact  of  systemic  reforms  to  be  promoted  by  the \nProject.  This  analysis  assesses  total  incremental  costs  incurred  by  the  Government  and  three \nparticipating public universities during project implementation and following completion as a share \nof  total  government  budgeting  for  education.  Analysis  was  conducted  for  a  range  of  scenarios. \nEven for the low-case scenario, where the total education budget remains stagnant from 2010 to \n2015,  the  Government\u2019s  annual  commitment  is  projected  to  remain  below  0.38%  of  the  total \neducation budget throughout the 6-year life of the Project, which is considered to be sustainable.17 \nThe incremental Government recurrent cost burden associated with the Project annually following \nproject  completion  is  estimated  at  less  than  0.36%  of  the  total  education  budget,  which  is  also \ndeemed affordable.  \n\n \n84. \nSecond,  the  projected  impact  of  reforms  promoted  by  the  Project  was  considered, \nfocusing on two core reforms. The first of these is the phased decrease in the share of quota \nstudents  (who  are  provided  living  allowances  while  being  exempt  from  tuition-related  and \ndormitory  fees)  from  roughly  50%  of  total  enrollments  prior  to  the  Project  to  20%  by  project \ncompletion in 2015, while ensuring that remaining quota spaces are targeted to students from \ndisadvantaged families. The second and complementary core reform is the phased introduction \nof  tuition  for  all  mainstream  courses  (exempting  noted  poor  quota  students)  to  reach  a  level \nequivalent  to  average  fees  formerly  charged  for  special  courses,  thereby  unifying  all  course \nofferings  under  a  single  system.  Growing  demand  for  fee-based  special  courses  at  public \nuniversities and the rapid growth of an array of generally more costly private higher education \nprograms demonstrate willingness-to-pay, thus indicating that such cost-recovery is viable. For \na range of indicative parameters, enhanced cost-recovery and more targeted provision of quota \nsubsidies  are  projected  to  substantially  decrease  the  Government's  budget  burden.  Freed-up \nresources  could  be  redeployed  to  fund  operation  and  maintenance  and  further  investments  to \nenhance  education  quality.  The  reforms  would  contribute  to  increased  system  efficacy  and \nefficiency,  while  improving  equity.  Finally,  in  addition  to  ensuring  the  sustainability  of  project \ninterventions, they will also help ensure that the expansion of higher education can be achieved \nwithout  drawing  state  resources  from  lower  tiers  of  education,  thereby  supporting  sustainable \nand equitable development of the education sector as a whole. \n \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES  \n\n \nIn addition to the standard assurances, the Government has given the following specific \n85.  \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents. The Government will undertake the \nfollowing:  \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nEstablish  university  councils  at  CU  and  SU  ensuring  that  representatives  from \nlocal  government,  private  sector,  and  cultural  and  related  social  sector  will \ncomprise  at  least  30%  membership  of  university  councils  of  three  public \nuniversities (NUOL, CU, and SU) by 2013. \nIntroduce tuition fees for regular nonquota courses amounting to (a) 50% of the \naverage tuition fee charged for the  special courses starting from 2011; (b) 75% \nby 2013; and (c) 100% by 2015. \n\n                                                 \n17  Adding  Government  contributions  to  ADB's  Basic  Education  Sector  Development  Program,  the  combined  share \n\nremains at only 0.7% of the total education budget in the low-case scenario, which remains affordable. \n\n23 \n\n \n\n\f24 \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\nReduce the share of quota students from (a) 50% to 30% by 2013, and (b) 30% \nto 20% by 2015, with more effective targeting to ensure increased enrollment of \nfemales, ethnic groups, and poor students. \nPromulgate  (a)  ministerial  decision  for  implementation  in  2011  to  introduce \nrevised  increased  dormitory  fees  for  regular  nonquota  students;  and  (b) \nuniversity  regulations  for  NUOL,  CU,  and  SU  for  implementation  in  2011  to \nintroduce improved benefit structure for their respective staff members. \nUpgrade the Research Coordination Committee at NUOL into a national research \ncenter within 6 months from grant effectiveness. The national research center will \nassist the university faculties at NUOL, CU, and SU to formulate proposals to the \nGovernment  and  a  range  of  funding  agencies,  including  the  private  sector,  for \nresearch grants. \nExecute  agreements  with  all  candidates  receiving  scholarships  or  grants  for \nundertaking  foreign  degrees  and  local  master\u2019s  degrees  to  ensure  scholarship \nrecipients  continue  working  with  the  same  ministry  or  institution  for  at  least  \n5 years after completing a foreign degree or local master\u2019s degree program. \nEnsure,  through  MOE,  that  any  project-funded  construction  of  campus  facilities \nwill  be  carried  out  on  government-owned  land,  with  valid  legal  title  free  from  all \nencumbrances and controversies.  \n\n(x) \n\n(xi) \n\n(ix) \n\n(viii)  Provide  counterpart  funds  for  project  implementation  on  time.  The  Government \nwill also make timely submission of annual budgetary appropriation requests for \nthe  higher  education  subsector  and  ensure  prompt  disbursement  of  appropriate \nfunds for the Project throughout the implementation period.  \nEnsure  through  MOE  that  ICT  resources,  developed  under  the  Project,  are \noperated  and  maintained  and  periodically  upgraded  after  project  completion  in \naccordance with the budgetary plan developed under the Project.  \nEnsure and cause MOE to ensure that the PDU develops (a) a merit-based and \ntransparent selection criteria for staff and faculty to undertake foreign degree or \ntraining  courses  to  be  financed  by  the  Project,  including  the  50:50  matching \nscholarship  grant  scheme;  and  (b)  result-based  monitoring  and  evaluation \nprogram based on the postactivity assessment system.  \nEnsure to implement by 2013 (a) policy and regulatory system developed under \nthe Project for effective regulation of both public and private HEIs, (b) application \nof accreditation criteria to public and private HEIs, and (c) application of a quality \nauditing system. \nEnsure  that  the  gender  and  ethnic  groups  action  plan  is  fully  implemented  and \nmonitored in a timely  manner in accordance with ADB's  policies on gender and \ndevelopment18 and  indigenous  peoples,19 and  adequate  resources  are  allocated \nfor this purpose. In particular, ensure that (a) the student quota system is revised \nto  increase  the  ratio  of  female  quota  students  from  ethnic  groups;  (b)  the  living \nallowances  to  disadvantaged  quota  students  are  increased;  and  (c)  special \npreference is given to women and ethnic groups when recruiting faculty members \nand staff for NUOL, CU, and SU. Women should comprise 40% of the university \ncouncils\u2019 membership, and at least 30% of all training and 50% of all scholarship \nrecipients of postgraduate degrees.  \n\n(xii) \n\n(xiii)  Ensure  that  the  site  selection,  design,  construction,  replacement  work,  and \noperation  of  facilities  will  be  implemented  in  accordance  with  the  Project\u2019s  IEE, \nrelevant Government regulations and standards, and ADB\u2019s Environment Policy, \n\n                                                 \n18  ADB. 1998.

Studies  that  have  assessed  the  baseline  status  of  higher  education  in  the \nLao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) include Asian Development Bank (ADB) planning \nand  review  documents  and  reports,  and  a  range  of  other  studies  and  reports  originating  from \ninternational and national organizations.1 The literature surveyed identifies a set of fundamental \nconstraints  seen  by  most  commentators  to  be  inherent  in  the  Lao  higher  education  system. \nThese  include  lack  of  effective,  efficient,  and  accountable  management  and  administrative \nsystems at public sector universities; lack of data to support the higher education system; and \npoor  coordination  between  public  and  private  universities.  In  the  area  of  relevance  of  higher \neducation  training  for  the  needs  of  the  labor  market,  the  lack  of  available  data  constrains  the \nability to carry out long-term strategic planning for higher education. Public universities need to \nupdate  their  curriculum  and  learning  materials,  especially  given  recent  changes  introduced \nunder  the  National  Education  System  Reform  Strategy,  2006\u20132015.  A  particular  need  is  to \nstandardize  and  raise  the  quality  of  the  curriculum  for  all  academic  and  technical  study \nprograms,  and  to  develop  appropriate  learning  materials  across  all  faculties  in  the  Lao \nlanguage. The research capacity of universities is also weak due to structural constraints, and \nlack of time and funding required to carry out research activities.  \n \n2. \nThe  physical  infrastructure  and  equipment  of  universities  needs  to  upgraded  to  that  of \nuniversities in neighboring countries, especially for libraries, science laboratories, and technical \nequipment. At Champasak University (CU), the development of basic infrastructure is urgently \nneeded  to  raise  it  to  the  standard  of  other  public  universities  within  the  country  and  in \nneighboring countries. The higher education system is characterized by low student enrollment \noverall,  and  lack  of  physical  capacity  to  expand  to  accommodate  planned  increases  in \nenrollment.  Access  opportunities  for  female  and  ethnic  students  is  still  limited,  particularly  for \nthose from more remote areas of the country. \n \nA major concern articulated by all stakeholders is the need to significantly increase the \n3. \nqualifications  of  academic  staff  by  implementing  comprehensive  staff  development  strategies. \nThe study programs provided by the public universities do not have a standardized credit point \nor  credit  transfer  system,  which  means  that  determining  the  value  of  particular  courses  or \nprograms is difficult, and student transfers between faculties or institutions is almost impossible: \nthe system has no provision for recognizing prior learning. \n \n4. \nManagement  and  Governance.  Management capacity in the higher education system \nin the Ministry of Education (MOE) and across the institutions is relatively underdeveloped. The \nmajor needs are in the areas of university governance and management, specifically autonomy \nand  accountability,  financing  mechanisms,  quality  assurance  and  accreditation  systems,  and \nmanagement of research and development; and public\u2013private partnerships. Increased primary \nand  secondary  enrollment  is  increasing  demand  for  higher  education,  causing  a  severe \nimbalance  between  demand  and  supply.  Data  information  systems  in  higher  education  lack \ninternal  linkages,  or  linkages  with  private  colleges.  They  lack  coordination,  integration,  and \naccess to an MOE central management information system. \n \n\n                                                 \n1  Ogawa, Keiichi. 2008.

Vientiane: MOE. \n\n \n\n\f32 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nAt  present  only  the  National  University  of  Laos  (NUOL)  has  a  council  and  a  council \n5. \npresident.  CU  and  Souphanovoung  University  (SU)  do  not  currently  have  formal  governance \narrangements in place to allow them to effectively manage the universities. At present, strategic \nplanning  for  higher  education  in  the  Lao  PDR  remains  largely  undeveloped.  MOE  provides \noverall direction for higher education, as outlined in the legislation. This includes appointments, \napprovals  and  recommendations,  institutional  plans,  and  curriculum-related  matters.  This  high \nlevel of control limits the degree to which institutions are able to position themselves for future \nstrategic development. The underfunding of the university system as a whole, and the year-on-\nyear  financing  system  frustrates  medium-  to  long-term  planning.  A  priority  is  to  establish \ncouncils at CU and SU under the jurisdiction of their respective provincial education authorities. \nThis  should  be  regarded  as  an  essential  precondition  for  implementation  of  future  reform \nstrategies.  \n \n6. \nThe higher education sector does not currently have a standardized system in place for \nthe  coordinated  collection,  dissemination,  and  utilization  of  up-to-date  data  and  information  to \nprovide  support  for  higher  education  administration  and  management.  The  higher  education \nsubsector  also  lacks  linkages  with  private  colleges.  The  lack  of  such  a  mechanism  adversely \naffects  administrative  efficiency  and  management  effectiveness.  In  addition  to  the  lack  of  a \nfunctioning education management information system, no centralized or standardized student \ndatabase is maintained to monitor the progress of individual students in the system. Centralized \ntimetabling systems are not used so that teaching spaces are not used efficiently. The current \npractice  is  that  classrooms  are  \u201cowned\u201d  by  particular  faculties.  Operating  efficiency  of  the \nDepartment  of  Higher  Education  and  higher  education  institution  (HEI)  management  and \nadministrative  system  is  in  critical  of  improvement  by  strengthening  MOE\u2019s  education \nmanagement information system. \n \n7. \nRelevance,  Attractiveness,  and  Competitiveness.  Assessment  and  analysis  of  the \nrelevance  of  higher  education  system  output  shows  that  significant  imbalances  exist  between \nthe  demand  for  and  supply  of  university  graduates.  There  is  a  shortage  of  professional  and \ntechnical personnel such as administrators, accountants, lawyers, and engineers in both public \nand private sectors.  Most HEIs cannot meet the needs of the labor market at present and little \ninformation  is  currently  available  on  the  employment  designations  of  university  graduates. \nPreliminary rapid labor market surveys, carried out in association with the Strengthening Higher \nEducation Project (the Project) project preparatory technical assistance are the first steps in the \nprocess  of  mapping  the  destinations  of  graduates  against  labor  market  needs.  Further  tracer \nstudies  will  be  launched  to  collect  benchmark  information  on  gradates  and  monitor  their \nperformance  in  the  labor  market.  Initial  results  indicate  a  recent  change  in  student  demand  at \nNUOL  to  law  and  tourism,  which  represents  a  trend  away  from  the  previous  preference  for \neconomics,  business  management,  and  information  technology.  In  the  commercial  sector, \ncustomer service, hotel and guesthouse operations, foreign languages, tourism operations, and \ncomputer technology are key labor market needs identified by the project preparatory technical \nassistance rapid labor market survey. These are the same fields of study now being offered by \npublic and private tertiary institutions. The key problem seems to be that the private sector and \nthe pool of tertiary school graduates are very young. Most enterprises are less than 6 years old, \n20%  are  less  than  1  year  old.2 One  result  of  this  new  employer\u2013new  employee  profile  is  a \nshortfall in supervisors with capacity for developing new staff. This contributes to the frustration \nreported by employers that college graduates lack the right skills and the frustration by students \nthat they don\u2019t get to practice what they were taught. The number of public university graduates \n\n                                                 \n2  National Statistics Center. 2007. Report of Economic Census 2006. Volume 1. Vientiane. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 2 \n\n33 \n\ntripled between 2000 and 2006. The bulk of college graduates are still in their transition period \nwhere they are in their first job or jobs and developing their understanding of the workplace and \nwork  skills,  a  difficulty  compounded  by  the  out-of-date  material  and  inexperience  of  their \ninstructors.  The  apparent  market  failure  may  simply  be  an  inefficient  job  placement  system \ncompounded  by  the  employer's  desire  for  experienced  staff  against  the  graduate's  need  for  a \nfirst job.  \n \n8. \nPast  international  partnerships  are  assessed  as  being  largely  symbolic  rather  than \npractical, with none of the partnerships adequately resourced The NUOL strategic plan includes \nthe  intention  to  promote  mutual  cooperation  with  international  universities  and  organizations \nwith regard to academic exchange, faculty exchange, joint research and publication, and other \nissues  deemed  appropriate  within  the  cooperating  institutions  to  foster  capacity  building  and \nsustainability. However these endeavors have had a limited impact. The systematic building of \nsubstantial  linkages  with  partner  institutions,  particularly  those  in  neighboring  countries,  needs \nto be supported. \n \nVery little academic research is currently carried out at universities. The most commonly \n9. \ncited reasons for low research output productivity are the large amount of time spent teaching \nby  most  academic  staff,  the  absence  of  appropriate  infrastructure  with  which  to  conduct \nresearch;  and  the  absence  of  funding  to  support  it.  The  provision  of  \u201cspecial  courses\u201d  held \nmostly in the evening also adversely affects research capacity. Since some staff are teaching up \nto 30 hours a week, little time is available to pursue research activities. Additionally, across all \ninstitutions,  a  shortage  of  all  types  of  equipment  reduces  the  ability  of  staff  to  conduct  quality \nresearch. Funding for academic research is also scarce, as a direct result of the year-on-year \nfunding approach adopted for universities and the requirement for universities to generate their \nown recurrent funding. \n \n10. \nQuality and Efficiency. The overall quality of public higher education is low due to the \npoor  quality  of  secondary  education,  dilapidated  facilities  and  equipment,  and  underqualified \nteaching staff. Few faculty members have postgraduate qualifications particularly at CU and SU, \nand  their  teaching  and  research  capacities  are  significantly  constrained  by  low  salaries, \nexcessive time spent teaching special courses, and lack of opportunity or funding for research. \nIn  addition,  uniform  quality  assurance  and  accreditation  systems  and  measures  have  not  yet \nbeen  established.  MOE\u2019s  Quality  Assurance  Center  is  currently  responsible  for  developing \nquality assurance policies and procedures for all education areas including secondary, technical, \nand vocational education and training, and private higher education. However the center is quite \nnew  and  so  far  the  policy  development  for  higher  education  is  not  yet  complete.  As  yet  no \nnational framework is in place for qualifications and accrual of credit. No standardized system \nfor allocating credit points or centralized database to store such information is available. These \nconditions  mean  that  study  programs  cannot  easily  be  evaluated.  Students  are  therefore  not \nable to receive recognition of prior learning when transferring between faculties or institutions.  \n \n11. \nAnother significant constraint for higher education, particularly at CU and SU, is the low \nprofessional  qualifications  of  academic  staff.  For  the  Lao  PDR  to  reach  its  national  goals  for \nhither  education,  the  qualifications,  teaching  skills,  and  research  capabilities  of  existing  staff \nmust  be  upgraded,  and  new  staff  recruited  to  respond  to  anticipated  increases  in  student \nenrollment. While NUOL has a reasonably well-qualified teaching staff. few faculty members at \nCU and SU have postgraduate qualifications. The new universities are staffed by new graduates \nwhose research and teaching capacity are greatly constrained.  \n \n\n \n\n\f34 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nAs of 2009, NUOL listed a total of 1,520 faculty and 350 administrative staff: 258 faculty \n12. \nmembers are listed as studying internationally and 932 as actively teaching.3 Of the total faculty, \n55  have  doctoral  degrees,  436  have  master\u2019s  degrees,  774  have  bachelor  degrees,  and  92 \nhave  diplomas.  The  figures  show  that  491  faculty  have  postgraduate  qualifications\u2014\napproximately  32%  of  the  academic  staff.  NUOL  has  articulated  a  target  of  10%  doctoral \ndegrees,  60%  master\u2019s  degrees,  and  30%  bachelor  degrees  by  2015.  This  presents  a \nsignificant  increase  in  the  number  of  faculty  with  master\u2019s  and  doctoral  qualifications.  The \nsituation  at  CU  and  SU \nis  more  critical.  Of  221  academic  staff  at  CU,  \n4  have  doctoral  qualifications  and  31  master\u2019s.  At  SU,  of  192  academic  staff,  2  have  doctoral \nqualifications  and  21  master\u2019s.  Both  CU  and  SU  are  aiming  for  a  similar  mix  of  qualifications \n(10:60:30) as indicated by NUOL. Current training programs for upgrading faculty qualifications \nwill  not  be  able  to  provide  the  number  of  staff  needed  to  meet  these  qualification  targets. \nAchieving  international  standards  for  teaching  and  course  delivery  requires  a  serious  and \nsustained  professional  development  program.  At  present  no  uniform  system  is  available  to \nassess professional performance of academic staff. \n \nThe  low  salaries  for  academic  staff  must  also  be  regarded  as  a  significant  constraint \n13. \naffecting higher education, with the result that public universities have difficulty retaining skilled \nand  experienced  academic  personnel,  leaving  the  universities  with  an  insufficient  number  of \nyoung,  underqualified,  and  relatively  inexperienced  staff.  Information  obtained  during  the \nsubsector analysis indicate that across the system, special course fees account for more than \n30%  of  university-earned  income,  and  enrollment  figures  show  that  special  course  students \nconstitute  around  30%  of  enrollment.  Staff  work  on  these  courses  in  addition  to  their  normal \nteaching duties, in some cases teaching up to a total of 30 hours per week or more. This has \nsignificant implications for the quality regular programs at the universities.  \n \n14. \nThe  current  status  of  campus  library  facilities  varies  considerably.  At  NUOL,  the  main \nlibrary  for  the  university  has  a  total  seating  capacity  of  approximately  310,  and  a  limited \ncollection  of  books.  While  internet  terminals  are  available  within  the  library,  less  than  \n10  terminals  are  available  for  almost  10,000  students.  The  broader  information  technology \ninfrastructure  on  campus  is  also  weak.  A  total  of  20  computer  labs  with  932  functioning \ncomputers  are  available  on  campus.  Like  classrooms,  computer  labs  are  strictly  allocated  by \nfaculty, making equal access and efficient utilization difficult. At SU, a large purpose-built library \nbuilding  is  largely  unutilized.  Only  a  few  open  access  computer  terminals  are  available  in  the \nlibrary  building.  CU  currently  has  no  viable  library.  The  provision  of  an  integrated  ICT-based \nlearning, teaching, and professional development network, incorporating e-library facilities would \nprovide a cost-effective alternative to development of a traditional library.  \n \nAccess  and  Equity.  Figures  obtained  during  the  subsector  analysis  indicate  that  total \n15. \nstudent  enrollment  at \nthree  public  universities  was  45,677  (NUOL  with  36,706,  \nCU with 4,755, and SU with 4,216). The University of Health Sciences has about 2,800 enrolled \nstudents.4 Currently  about  5.3%  of  the  tertiary  education  age  cohort  is  enrolled  at  the  three \npublic universities (NUOL, CU, and SU), the Ministry of Health-administered University of Health \nSciences, five teacher training colleges, and 86 private HEIs located in Vientiane and provincial \ncapital  cities5 Capacity  to  meet  the  projected  increase  in  the  number  of  students  is  limited.  In \n2007,  only  24,754  students  (about  57%)  of  the  43,653  upper  secondary  school  graduates \n\nthe \n\n                                                 \n3  Data was obtained by the PPTA team during site visits to each of the three public HEIs. \n4   Information obtained from the University of Health Sciences, Vientiane, April 2009. \n5    Boupha,  Phonephet.  2008.

Vientiane. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 2 \n\n35 \n\ngained  access  to  public  universities.  This  gap  between  enrollment  demand  and  admission \ncapacity  of  public  universities  is  expected  to  widen  if  current  trends  continue.  To  meet  this \nunmet demand, many private colleges were established (mainly in business-related areas such \nas business administration, computer and information science, and English language) in recent \nyears.  \n \n16. \nIn addition to low enrollment, social and ethnic disparities in access still persist, resulting \nin low representation of women and ethnic groups. In 2008, female students represented 35.3% \nof student enrollment at NUOL, 36.6% at SU, and 49% at CU. At NUOL, ethnic quota students \ncomprised  approximately  35%  and  ethnic  female  quota  students  approximately  17%.  The \nassistance  provided  at  present  under  the  quota  system  consists  of  fees  being  met  and \naccommodation provided. Quota students are selected by provincial authorities on the basis of \ntheir  results  at  the  end  of  secondary  school  year  and  nominated  to  the  Department  of  Higher \nEducation (DHE) for placement in the universities. They are largely drawn from rural areas and \ninclude  ethnic  groups.  Scholarships  are  given  to  quota  students  to  cover  their  fees.  However \nmany  of  the  quota  students  often  come  from  schools  that  were  below  standard  and  may \nexperience  difficulties  because  they  may  be  underprepared  for  tertiary  study.  Their  living \nconditions  in  student  dormitories  are  also  extremely  basic  and  not  conducive  to  independent \nstudy. Quota students receive KN70,000 per month ($8.20), as a living allowance. This figure is \nvery low by any standard, and indicates the hardship many quota students face. Quota students \nare expected to return to their home provinces following graduation, and remain in government \nservice  for  5  years.  However  this  has  not  always  been  effective  as  students  often  prefer  to \nremain in urban areas with greater employment opportunities. The quota system was intended \nto open access to higher education for disadvantaged students including ethnic origin students. \nSince no official enrollment data is available, anecdotal data is used to assess the effectiveness \nof  the  current  support  system  for  disadvantaged  students.  Many  quota  students  selected  for \nadmission  are  reported  to  fail  to  register  for  the  commencement  of  their  studies.  This  may  be \ndue  to  delays  in  the  publication  of  results  of  entrance  tests,  and  the  fact  that  students  are \ndirected into courses of studies that may not have been their first choice. Under the Education \nSector Development Framework, student fees are set to rise substantially, but with an offset that \nseeks  to  guarantee  equity  of  access  to  worthy  but  financially  stressed  students.  These \nconditions  indicate  the  need  to  more  effectively  target  disadvantaged  candidates,  use  more \nrigorous  and  effective  selection  procedures,  provide  a  more  substantial  living  allowance,  cater \nmore directly for student study preferences, and support academically weak quota students with \ntailored preliminary skills upgrading programs.  \n \n17.  MOE plans to introduce a new education system by changing from 11 years school + 2 \nyears foundation + 3 years degree to 12 years school + 4 years degree from September 2011. \nHowever,  the  change  has  not  been  introduced  in  a  coordinated  way,  with  the  result  that  the \ncurrent  undergraduate  intake  of  students  faces  different  conditions  from  one  institution  to \nanother. At NUOL, the School of Foundation Studies was abolished from the beginning of the \n2008/09 academic year, with the result that individual faculties are now running their own basic \nfoundation  programs.  At  CU  and  SU,  the  change  is  expected  to  be  in  place  from  September \n2009. This change is expected to have a significant impact on quota students, many of whom \nwill  not  be  able  to  cope  with  the  academic  rigors  of  tertiary  studies  without  undergoing \nappropriate  bridging  training.  Faculty-based  foundation  training  will  be  variable  in  quality  and \ndifficult to regulate or to assess outcomes. \n \nterms of infrastructure, facilities, classroom space, and equipment, all public institutions \n18. \nsurveyed report that they are currently operating at full capacity. This means that they would be \nunable  to  meet  the  stated  targets  of  increasing  enrollment  without  substantially  increasing \n\n \n\n\f36 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\navailable  physical  infrastructure  at  all  university  campuses.  Existing  capacity  can  however  be \nincreased by more efficient use of teaching spaces.  \n \n19. \nThe  quality  of  infrastructure,  facilities,  and  equipment  varies  considerably  across  the \nthree  universities.  While  NUOL  is  relatively  well  established,  the  newly  opened  CU  and  SU \nrequire very large investments in facilities (e.g., teaching rooms, equipment, and research and \nteaching  laboratories).  Equipment  and  teaching  support  infrastructure  at  NUOL  needs  to  be \nregularly maintained and upgraded to keep pace with technological developments and cater for \nfuture expansion of student enrollment.  \n \n20. \nAn overwhelming need for additional infrastructure exists at CU. A primary focus of ADB \ngrant assistance to higher education will be to carry out substantial civil works, as a precursor to \nall  other  development  activities,  at  the  CU  campus.  A  development  strategy  for  civil  works, \nfacilities, and equipment at CU, within specified scoping and budgetary parameters, is therefore \npresented as a key output for ADB grant assistance. \n \nFinance.  The  universities  construct  their  budgets  by  identifying  the  estimated  student \n21. \nload in all categories, and forward an estimation of their income. On this basis, the Government \ndetermines  its  allocations  to  the  universities.  In  government  accounting  data  for  education \nsector funding, \u201cprivate funding\u201d refers to funds received from development agencies. The data \nindicates that such funding has outpaced government funding by a factor of 3\u20134 to 1 for several \nyears.  Determining  the  exact  proportion  of  government  direct  funding  relative  to  development \nfunding  is  difficult.  However,  development  funding  clearly  comprises  a  significant  contribution. \nThe  importance  of  this  nongovernment  funding  is  shown  in  Education  Sector  Development \nFramework  projections.  Of  all  education  subsectors,  higher  education  alone  is  scheduled  to \nreceive less government direct funding by 2015. Conversely, by that date, private funding is set \nto constitute 80% of financial inflow. However  the proportion contributed via student fees is not \nclear. \n \n22. \nThe private higher education system represents a large component of tertiary education. \nPrivate  higher  education  has  the  potential  to  contribute  significantly  to  the  financing  of  higher \neducation.  However  MOE  must  closely  monitor  the  operation  of  private  HEIs  to  ensure  they \nmeet minimum quality standards. A standardized quality regulatory framework used to monitor \noperation  and  performance  in  public  universities  should  also  be  applied  to  private  HEIs.  DHE \nneeds to be empowered to accredit new private HEIs provided they meet the specified minimum \nstandards.  DHE  also  needs  to  carry  out  regular  audits  of  private  HEIs  to  ensure  that  they \ncomply  with  the  standards  framework  criteria.  Appropriate  legislative  support  will  need  to  be \nprovided to grant ongoing accreditation of private HEIs on this basis. \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 3 \n\n37 \n\nEXTERNAL ASSISTANCE \n\n \n1. \nFrom  1989  to  2008,  technical  assistance  (TA)  funded  by  the  Asian  Development  Bank \n(ADB)  to  the  education  sector  totaled  $9.21  million.

A priority \nfor the Project is to address the issue of low professional qualifications of academic staff at the \ncountry\u2019s  universities,  particularly  at  Champasak  University  (CU)  and  Souphanouvong \nUniversity (SU). Upgrading of qualifications, teaching skills, and research capabilities of existing \nstaff is urgently needed, and additional new staff recruited to respond to anticipated increases in \nstudent  enrollment.  At  present,  the  new  universities  (CU  and  SU)  are  staffed  by  mainly  new \ngraduates with limited opportunities to upgrade their qualifications or carry out research. \n \nIn  2009,  of  the  total  1,265  graduate  academic  and  administrative  staff  at  the  National \n2. \nUniversity of Laos (NUOL), 55 had doctoral education (4%), 436 had master\u2019s degrees (34%), \nand  774  had  bachelor  degrees  (62%).  The  universities  have  articulated  a  target  qualification \nratio  of  10%:60%:30%  by  2015.  The  current  mix  at  CU  is  2:16:82;  at  SU,  it  is  1:12:77.  The \nProject provides a significant scholarship program to redress this staffing qualification shortfall.  \n \nA. \n \nInternational and Domestic Degree Programs. The Project will provide the opportunity \n3. \nfor 147 staff and faculty members to undertake study for higher degree qualifications in the Lao \nPeople's Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) and abroad. This includes 40 master\u2019s degrees mostly \nin  neighbouring  countries  (approximately  20  for  CU,  13  for  SU,  7  for  NUOL);  and  20  doctoral \nprograms in neighboring and developed countries (10 for CU, 7 for SU, 3 for NUOL). In addition, \nthe  Project  will  fund  7  postgraduate  degrees  (4  master\u2019s  degrees  and  3  doctoral  degrees)  for \nthe  staff  of  the  Department  of  Higher  Education  (DHE)  of  MOE,  and  80  public  university \nacademic  staff  to  study  at  the  master\u2019s  level  at  NUOL  in  Vientiane.  The  bulk  of  the  degree \ntraining  will  be  undertaken  over  years  2\u20134  of  the  Project,  phased  carefully  to  minimize  the \nimpact of the removal of key staff from faculties that are already understaffed. This time frame \nwill  allow  the  Project  to  ensure  that  recipients  of  scholarships  return  to  their  respective \nworkplaces, and that returnees subsequently make full use of skills acquired from their training.  \n \n4. \nInternational  Matching  Scholarship  Grants.  A  new  scheme  of  matching  scholarship \ngrants  (50:50  matching  between  the  Project  and  partner  foreign  universities  that  provide \nscholarships  to  the  Lao  PDR)  will  be  implemented  on  a  pilot  basis.  Of  the  60  master\u2019s  and \ndoctoral scholarships specified, up to 40 are expected to be funded through the matching grant \nscheme, with a view to providing study in postgraduate degree programs in developed countries \nsuch  as  Australia,  Japan,  United  Kingdom,  or  United  States.  This  is  expected  to  significantly \nextend the number of scholarships that might be offered by the Project. The Project will cover \nthe  tuition  fess  and  international  travel  costs,  while  partner  foreign  universities  in  developed \ncountries  will  cover  the  living  costs  and  other  expenses  that  would  be  higher  than  in \nneighbouring countries.  \n \nB. \n \n5. \nSelection will initially be prioritized to address current critical shortfalls in staffing within \nparticular  faculties  or  disciplines.  Selection  will  take  account  of  priority  needs  determined  by \ninitial labor market needs analyses. The selection package for the first scholarship cohort will be \nproduced and implemented by the third quarter of year 1. The same process will be repeated for \nthe two successive cohorts in years 2 and 3. \n\nScholarship Selection Criteria (Indicative) \n\n \n\n\f50 \n\nAppendix 8 \n\nThe  professional  development  unit  (PDU)  to  be  located  at  NUOL  will  develop  a \n6. \ntransparent  and  merit-based  selection  process  in  coordination  with  outreach  PDUs  at  CU  and \nSU and DHE project implementation unit. The selection process will be managed by the central \nPDU under the guidance of specialist advisors. The MOE project coordination unit will approve \nthe final selection of each cohort.  \n \n7. \nThe  following  two  sets  of  indicative  selection  criteria  will  be  used  to  select  suitable \ncandidates for degree scholarships: (i) general eligibility criteria, and (ii) other eligibility criteria. \nThe general eligibility criteria include:  \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\nbe a citizen and resident of the Lao PDR and not have a permanent residence in \nany other country; \nat the time of application, be not more than 45 years of age; \nhave  worked  for  a  minimum  of  2  years  in  relevant  employment  in  MOE  or  a \nhigher education institution;  \nbe supported by supervisors, and have signed a written agreement for continuing \nrelevant employment for a minimum of 2 years after graduation; \nprovide  evidence  that  new  personal  research  skills  in  the  discipline  selected \ncould contribute to enhancing their university\u2019s teaching and research programs; \ndemonstrate that the training is consistent with the development priorities of the \nLao PDR; and  \nfor international programs, have met, or be able to meet before commencement \nof the course, the academic entry requirements and English language proficiency \nset by the university for the study program for which enrollment is sought. \n\n \n8. \nOther  eligibility  criteria  will  be  established  to  ensure  that  the  scholarship  program \nassistance supports the access and equity targets specified in project design. These include the \nfollowing: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nA  target  of  at  least  50%  is  specified  for  female  candidates  selected  for \nscholarship awards.  \nA target of 20% is set for candidates selected from target ethnic groups or the six \npoorest provinces identified via recognized poverty indicators.  \n\nEvaluation and Sustainability  \n\n \nC.  \n \nThe  anticipated  impact  of  the  scholarship  program  will  be  measured  in  terms  of  the \n9. \nextent to which graduate alumni return to their respective workplaces. The Project will execute \nagreements with all candidates receiving scholarships or grants for undertaking foreign degrees \nand  local  master\u2019s  degrees  to  ensure  scholarship  recipients  continue  working  with  the  same \nministry  or  higher  education  institution  for  at  least  5  years  after  completing  a  foreign  degree \nprogram and 2 years after completing local master\u2019s degrees. To assess the efficacy of the staff \nand  faculty  development  programs,  participant  feedback  methodologies  including  postactivity \nassessment  will  determine  the  extent  their  newly  acquired  skills  will  be  utilized  in  their \nrespective workplaces.  \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 9 \n\n51 \n\nECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS \n\nEconomic Analysis \n\n \nA.   \n \nBy improving access to and, particularly, the quality and relevance of higher education, \n1. \nthe  Project  will  have  important  economic  benefits  for  individuals  and  the  overall  economy. \nParticularly  in  economies  characterized  by  rapid  growth  and  transformation,  completion  of \nhigher  education  is  associated  with  higher  individual  wages  as  well  as  enhanced  capacity  to \nrespond  to  new  economic  opportunities  in  emerging  modern  sectors.  Limited  data  and  a \ndiversity of types, delivery modes, and quality of postsecondary education in the Lao People's \nDemocratic  Republic  (Lao  PDR)  make  obtaining  precise,  unbiased  estimates  of  the  returns  to \nhigher  education  difficult.  However,  existing  evidence  suggests  that  with  the  country\u2019s  rapid \ngrowth and economic transformation, demand for human capital has outstripped the supply of \ntertiary  education  graduates,  resulting  in  a  growing  wage  premium  for  graduates  from  higher \nversus secondary education. Investments in expanding the enrollment capacity at Champasak \nUniversity will increase the number of higher education graduates flowing into the labor market \nannually,  while  the  impact  of  improved  quality  and  relevance  of  education  will  enhance  labor \nmarket returns to graduates of all three universities.  \n \n2. \nThe  Project  will  yield  significant  macro  benefits.  Currently,  an  inadequate  supply  of \nhighly  educated  young  adults  poses  a  major  constraint  to  the  country\u2019s  economic  vitality, \ncompetitiveness,  ability  to  attract  foreign  direct  investment,  and  ability  to  advance  in \ntechnological  areas  into  higher  value-added  sectors.  The  potential  benefits  for  economic  and \nbroader national development are clearly reflected in the high degree of priority the Government \nascribes to expanding and improving higher education. In addition to enhancing the efficiency of \nstate funding for education and supporting increased education access, relevance, and quality \nin  the  public  university  system,  the  Project  will  strengthen  the  regulatory  environment  and \nquality  assurance  in  the  private  higher  education  subsector,  magnifying  its  short  and  longer-\nterm economic impacts. \n \n3. \nThe  Project's  approach  also  appears  strongly  justified  on  cost,  sustainability,  and  equity \ngrounds,  when  compared  with  other  options  for  expanding  higher  education  access.  A  first \nalternative  might  be  to  send  more  students  to  universities  in  neighboring  countries.  However, \naside  from  issues  such  as  language  of  instruction  and  curricular  alignment,  the  costs  of  tuition, \ntravel,  accommodation,  and  other  living  expenses  for  study  abroad  greatly  exceed  those  for  in-\ncountry  study,  and  are  generally  rising  at  a  rapid  rate  in  nearby  countries.  Under  various  cost-\nsharing  schemes,  this  would  pose  a  heavy  and  rising  burden  on  both  the  Lao  government  and \nindividuals. Relying on study abroad rather than developing the domestic higher education system \nwould  also  raise  other  serious  issues,  including  inequity  (as  poorer  students  with  weaker \nacademic  backgrounds  would  be  excluded),  relevance  of  learning  to  Lao  labor  markets,  and \npotential for increased movement of educated labor out of the Lao PDR. It would also undercut \nthe development of national human resources in the country and the domestic higher education \nsystem's contributions to local economic development. A second potential alternative would be to \nrely  principally  on  domestic  private  sector  higher  education  provision,  with  the  state  providing \nvouchers  or  other  subsidies.  However,  while  charges  across  private  higher  education  institution \n(HEI) programs vary considerably, they generally exceed the estimated total per-student costs of \neducation  in  public  universities,  and  this  cost  disparity  is  likely  to  grow  over  time.  In  addition  to \ncost and equity concerns, in the present context, education quality is problematic in many of the \ngrowing array of HEIs. Given this, the Project's approach to supporting expanded, higher-quality \npublic  higher  education  while  strengthening  the  policy  and  regulatory  framework  for  both  public \nand private HEIs (including quality auditing and alignment of curricula) appears strongly justified.  \n\n \n\n\f52 \n\nAppendix 9 \n\nLabor Market Assessment \n\nB. \n \n4. \nThe labor market is in a dynamic but nascent state. Only 7% of all workers are employed \nby  the  Government  and  private  sector.  The  rest  are  own  account  and  unpaid  family  workers: \nfarmers  and  their  wives1 and  small  family  businesses.  The  private  sector  is  characterized  by \nentrepreneurship  rather  than  expertise,  such  as  the  contractor  turned  hotelier.  Young  people \nentering higher education choose a field of study in their second year with little understanding of \nfuture  prospects.  At  graduation,  they  find  jobs  by  word  of  mouth.  Few  new  graduates  are \nunemployed,  less  than  3%,  as  they  cannot  afford  to  be  idle.  As  a  result,  they  face  a  long \ntransition  period,  referred  to  as  \"not  finding  a  job  in  their  field  of  study,\"  where  they  try  out \ndifferent  types  of  employment,  often  at  low  wages,  while  gaining  experience  and  work  skills \nbefore  settling  into  longer-term  employment.  The  transition  period  is  exacerbated  by  (i) \nemployer's  lack  of  sector  experience  and,  thus,  ability  to  provide  on-the-job  training;  (ii) \ninefficient job placement system; and (iii) the quality of their education.  \n \n5. \nThe pool of university graduates is young. From 2000 to 2006, the number of graduates \nproduced  by  the  public  system  increased  from  2,200  per  year  to  6,000.  The  bulk  of  college \ngraduates are still in their transition period where they are in their first job or first jobs, and are \ndeveloping their understanding of the workplace and work skills. This is made more difficult by \nout-of-date material and inexperience of their instructors. Labor force participation by male and \nfemale  university  graduates 2  is  high  relative  to  secondary  school  and  elementary  school \ngraduates:  86%  of  university  graduates  are  in  the  labor  force  compared  with  48%  for  upper \nsecondary,  58%  for  lower  secondary,  and  60%  for  elementary  school.  Unemployment  is  low \nacross all levels of education. Although investment into university education is more costly than \nlower education, it does yields more workers per 100 graduates.  \n \n6. \nThe  Government\u2019s  first  economic  census  in  2006  enumerated  127,000  enterprises \nemploying  345,000  workers,  almost  equally  divided  between  men  and  women.  The  survey \nexcludes enterprises in  villages without  roads  and  mobile operations such as fruit  vendors.  The \ncensus shows the private sector to be young: 20% of all enterprises were established less than 1 \nyear and 60% for less than 5 years; only 2.4% had more than 10 employees. One result of this \nyoung employer\u2013young employee profile is a shortfall in supervisors with capacity for developing \nnew staff. This contributes to the frustration reported by employers that college graduates lack the \nright skills and the frustration by students that they don\u2019t get to practice what they were taught.  \n \n7. \nAnother  costly  and  potentially  socially  disruptive  result  is  the  importation  of  skilled \nworkers  such  as  accountants,  engineers,  and  supervisors.  The  2006  economic  census  shows \nthat  4%  of  private  sector  employees  are  foreign.  Most  are  in  wholesale  or  retail  trade, \nconstruction,  and  manufacturing.  The  tourism  sector  is  small  but  with  high  growth  potential. \nThere,  foreign  staff  are  found  even  below  the  supervisor  level,  at  the  front  office  checking  in \nguests, providing information about places of interest in the area, and night auditing or compiling \nfinancial reports on daily activities for management. \n \n8. \nProject  initiatives  will  reduce  the  duration  of  the  transition  period  and  need  for  foreign \nstaff  through  an  improved  and  more  relevant  curriculum,  increased  ties  and  communication \nbetween  employers  and  lecturers  ensuring  enhancing  curriculum  content,  earlier  and  more \nfrequent student exposure to the workplace, and student placement support. \n\n                                                 \n1   Of  those  surveyed,  42%  are  own  account  workers  (68%  male  and  32%  female)  and  45%  unpaid  family  workers \n(29% male and 71% female). In household enterprises the husband is identified as the own account worker while \nthe wife is identified as the own account worker. \n\n2   Results from the Population and Housing Census 2005 and the Lao Expenditure and Consumption Survey 2008. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 9 \n\n53 \n\nFinancial Sustainability Analysis \n\nC.  \n \n9. \nThe  financial  sustainability  analysis  determines  the  fiscal  impact  of  the  Project  on  the \nGovernment\u2019s  projected  budget  during  the  6  years  planned  for  project  implementation.  The \nanalysis  assesses  the  affordability  and,  therefore,  sustainability  of  the  Project  vis-\u00e0-vis  the \ngovernment budget. The Government\u2019s share in the Project is estimated at $2.0 million over 6 \nyears  (according  to  the  Country  Operation  Business  Plan,  2009\u20132011);  this  includes \nincremental recurrent cost due to the Project, and taxes and duties. Two scenarios are used to \nanalyze  affordability:  (i)  a  high  case  scenario  where  the  Government  education  budget  is \nprojected  for  2010\u20132015  based  on  trends  of  actual  2002\u20132008  budgets,  and  (ii)  a  low  case \nscenario where the education budget remains the same from 2010 to 2015.  \n \nThe  annual  share  of  the  Government  in  the  project  cost,  together  with  estimated \n10. \ncommitments  in  the  ongoing  ADB-funded  Basic  Education  Sector  Development  Program,  were \ncompared with the annual education budget for 2010 to 2015 under both scenarios. For the high \ncase  scenario,  the  Government\u2019s  annual  commitment  as  a  percentage  of  the  education  budget \nranges from 0.05% to 0.67%, with an average of 0.32% over the 6-year life of the Project (Table \nA9.1). After project completion in 2015, the incremental recurrent costs borne by the Government \n(including operation, maintenance, and upgrading of e-learning centers at each university) will be \n0.22% of the total education budget in 2016, declining in subsequent years. \n \n\nTable A9.1: High Case Scenarioa \n \n2010 \n430 \n635 \n1,065 \n160 \n0.67 \n\nItem \nGovernment Share in the Project ($\u2018000) \nGovernment Share in the BESDP ($\u2018000) \nTotal Government Commitment ($\u2018000) \nGovernment Education Budget ($ million)  \n% Government Share of Education Budget \nBESDP = Basic Education Sector Development Program. \na The high case scenario assumes the education budget will increase based on 2002\u20132008 trend.  \nSource: Finance Department, Ministry of Education, and projected to year 2015. \n \n11. \nIn the low case scenario, the Government\u2019s annual commitment as a percentage of the \neducation  budget  ranges  from  0.07%  to  0.70%,  averaging  0.36%  over  the  6-year  life  of  the \nProject (Table A9.2).

In particular, it assesses the impact of two core reforms \non average cost-recovery per student. The first of these is the phased decrease in the share of \nquota students, who are provided living allowances while being exempt from tuition-related and \ndormitory  fees.  The  Project  targets  the  reduction  of  this  share  from  roughly  50%  of  total \nenrollment prior to the Project to 20% of students by project completion in 2015, with the latter \nrestricted  to  those  from  the  most  disadvantaged  families\u2014the  result  of  more  systematic  and \naccurate  targeting.  The  second  and  complementary  core  reform  is  the  phased  introduction  of \ntuition  for  all  mainstream  courses  (but  exempting  the  poorest  students)  to  reach  a  level \nequivalent  to  average  fees  formerly  charged  for  special  courses,  thereby  unifying  all  course \nofferings  under  a  singular  system.  Growing  demand  for  fee-based  special  courses  at  public \nuniversities and the rapid growth of an array of generally more costly private higher education \nprograms demonstrate willingness-to-pay, thus indicating that such cost-recovery is viable.  \n \n14. \nFor  a  range  of  indicative  parameters,  enhanced  cost-recovery  and  more  targeted \nprovision  of  quota  subsidies  are  projected  to  result  in  substantial  cost  recovery  even  in \nscenarios that include a 50% increase in the living allowances provided to the poorest 20% of \nstudents  remaining  on  quota.  While  gaps  in  available  data  prevent  precise  estimation,  the \nreforms  phased-in  by  project  completion  are  projected  to  more  than  double  cost-recovery  per \nstudent  in  2015  onward,  compared  with  the  no-reform  scenario.  This  implies  a  substantial \ndecrease in the Government's budget burden, while freed-up resources could be redeployed to \nfund  operation  and  maintenance,  and  investments  to  enhance  education  quality.  At  the  same \ntime,  by  rationalizing  the  allocation  of  education  resources  across  mainstream  and  currently \nseparate  special  courses,  the  reforms  would  contribute  to  increased  system  efficacy  and \nefficiency,  while  improving  equity.  Finally,  in  addition  to  ensuring  the  sustainability  of  project \ninterventions,  the  reforms  will  help  ensure  that  the  expansion  of  higher  education  can  be \nachieved  without  drawing  state  resources  from  lower  tiers  of  education,  thereby  supporting \nsustainable and equitable development of the education sector as a whole. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 10 \n\n55 \n\nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY \n\nCountry and Project Title: Lao People's Democratic Republic: Strengthening Higher Education Project \n\n \n\n \n\nLending/Financing Modality:  Grant \n\nDepartment/Division: \n\nSoutheast Asia Department/ \nSocial Sectors Division \n\nI. \n\nPOVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\nA. Link to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \n \nThe comprehensive National Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategy (NGPRS) is built on the concept of growth with equity. It notes \nthat  increasing  the  number  of  tertiary  school  graduates  is  needed  to  improve  economic  rates  of  return  on  human  capital \ninvestment,  and  that  professionals  and  intellectuals  are  required  to  harness  modern  science  and  technology  for  development \nneeds.  Improving  tertiary  education  supports  delivery  of  quality  social  services  while  reducing  dependence  on  cheap  labor  to \nattract foreign domestic investment. The NGPRS targets a 6% increase in the number of tertiary school graduates between 2005 \nand  2020.  The  Education  Sector  Development  Framework  2009\u20132015  is  an  explicitly  pro-poor  framework  addressing \ninclusiveness  and  equity  in  education  for  poor  and  ethnic  minority  pupils  from  preschool  through  nonformal  and  tertiary \neducation.  Thus  investments  in  tertiary  education  are  planned  in  the  context  of  the  overall  system.  The  midterm  review  of  the \n2009  country  partnership  strategy  recognizes  the  need  to  include  tertiary,  and  technical  and  vocational  education  and  training \n(TVET)  development  as  part  of  the  comprehensive  education  sector  development  supported  by  the  Asian  Development  Bank \n(ADB)  to  increase  the  quality  of  human  capital  in  the  public  and  private  sectors.a  The  Project  is  in  line  with  the  ADB  Strategy \n2020, which notes that \"future competitiveness will be determined less by low wages for labor and more by the ability to produce \nand  master  technology  and  produce  higher-value  goods  and  services.\u201db  The  2008  ADB  study  report,  Education  and  Skills, \ndiscusses the role of higher education in national and regional development.c \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                 Targeting Classification: General Intervention (GI) \n \n1.    Key Issues  \nPoor quality human resources constrain the delivery of social services and the development of employment in small- and medium-\nsized enterprises. The shortage of tertiary school graduates and their relatively low quality contributes to a poverty trap where poorly \neducated college graduates return as teachers to teach poorly educated secondary school students, and where manufacturing and \nindustry  are  based  on  ample  availability  of  cheap  unskilled  laborers  who  without  technological  skills  are  unable  to  advance  to \nhigher  value-added  sectors.  The  current  incidence  of  poverty  is  28%,d  down  from  33%  in  2003\u2014a  major  achievement  for  the \ncountry. Further inroads in poverty  reduction  will require development of  processing industries,  and creation of  higher productivity \nand better paid jobs. The Lao People's Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) is surrounded by countries with highly skilled labor. More \ninvestment is needed at all levels of education to enable the country to move ahead rather than fall further behind. \n \nEquity  is  a  major  issue.  Enrolment  in  tertiary  education  has  been  primarily  male,  from  specific  ethnic  groups,  and  from  better-off \nhouseholds. To promote national unity and women's equality the Government provides a 50% quota or scholarships emphasizing \nadmission of women and ethnic minorities. The quota system has suffered from low transparency and the perception that students \nfrom better-off households were the primary beneficiaries. Due to funding constraints, the scholarship and living allowance provided \nis insufficient to cover actual costs, therefore students from poor households often are unable to afford to continue their education \ndespite the scholarship. The result is that opportunities for the advancement of ethnic minorities and women are missed. \n \nThe Project is designed to strengthen the higher education system as a whole. As Souphanovoung University in Luang Prabang and \nthe National University of Laos (NUOL) in Vientiane have already received substantial external assistance to increase their physical \ncapacity, only the unserved Champasak University (CU), serving the five southern provinces, is scheduled for investment in increase \nphysical capacity. Investments in other capacity building activities including staff and faculty development programs, and textbook \nand material development are allocated across the national university system.  \n \n\nII. \n\nSOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\nA.  Findings of Social Analysis \n \nThe social analysis indicates huge demand for post senior secondary education driven by increased participation rates in lower \neducation,  decreasing  poverty,  and  the  importance  students  and  their  families  place  on  tertiary  education.  While  enrollment \ncapacity of public universities has more than tripled since 2000, the private sector has responded to fill the gaps. The increase in \ncapacity has not been matched by the increased quality required to obtain the true value of the finances and effort expended. As \na result, a public sector intervention is needed to improve the quality of the public system and to provide guidance and leadership \nfor  the  private  sector.  The  private  sector  is  unlikely  to  invest  in  accreditation  and  creation  of  standards  since  these  are  public \ngoods whose benefit they cannot capture. Therefore the public sector\u2019s role is to intervene. \n \n\n \n\n\f56  \n\nAppendix 10 \n\n \n\nAccess  is  a  major  concern.  Tertiary  education  is  largely  for  male,  although  the  gap  is  closing.  Students  from  rural  areas, \nespecially areas where ethnic groups are concentrated have difficulty competing because of the relatively poor quality of basic \nand  secondary  education  in  these  areas.  Providing  remedial  actions  such  as  scholarships  and  living  allowances,  ensuring \nadequate dormitory facilities for women, and providing academic support to students from underrepresented areas are important. \n \nThe  investment  in  CU  is  needed  to  equalize  opportunities  across  the  country,  as  the  north  and  central  regions  are  already \nserved.  While  students  from  the  southern  provinces  can  enroll  in  Souphanovong  University  or  NUOL,  the  region  misses  the \ndevelopment impact of having an institution for higher education nearby. The university can and should play a role in supporting \ndevelopment  of  the  business  community.  At  present  however  few  linkages  exist  in  Champasak,  Vientiane,  or  Luang  Prabang. \nAnother project initiative is to create these linkages to increase the contribution of universities to regional growth and job creation. \n \nEmployers  and  students  are  disappointed  with  the  current  higher  education  system.  Employers  feel  they  are  not  getting  the \ndesired expertise and graduates are not getting the good jobs they expected (Appendix 9). The issues involve the combination of \na new and inexperienced private sector, a pool of university graduates mainly comprising new labor market entrants, and a need \nto improve the curriculum content based on various factors including inputs from the private sector.  \n \nB.  Consultation and Participation \n \n1. Provide a summary of the consultation and participation process during the project preparation. \nDuring  project  preparation,  the  consultant  and  project  team  visited  the  three  universities  to  meet  with  staff,  propose  project \nobjectives, and collect data and other information on higher education. The design was informed by a small-scale survey of students \non  why they decided to enter university. Discussions  were held  with nonacademic stakeholder organizations such as the national \nand provincial chambers of commerce, Lao Women\u2019s Union, Lao Front for National Construction, and Poverty Reduction Fund staff.  \n \n2. What level of consultation and participation (C&P) is envisaged during the project implementation and monitoring?  \n\n  Information sharing       \n\n  Consultation      \n\n  Collaborative decision making     \n\n Empowerment \n\n No  \n\n Yes    \n\n \n3.  Was a C&P plan prepared? \n \nC.   Gender and Development \n \n1.    Key Issues \nThe official policy of the Government of the Lao PDR is to promote national, district, and village gender equality. A key element of \nthis policy is to increase access for women and girls to education at all levels. In 2005, educational attainment of employed females \nin the labor force was 7.7% for technical and vocational qualification, college diploma, and university degree. Educational attainment \nwas comparatively higher for employed males: 8.6%, 2.2%, and 14.1% respectively. A gender imbalance exists in accessing primary \nand lower secondary education. Girls' enrollment in primary school lags that of boys\u2019 by approximately 14%, and in lower secondary \neducation by  more than  12%. The  net  enrollment ratio for girls  is  also influenced by access  in rural  and  urban areas: for  primary \neducation it is estimated at 49% for girls in rural areas without road access (56% for boys), 72% in rural areas with road access (75% \nfor  boys),  and  91%  in  urban  areas  (88%  for  boys).  This  leads  to  lower  completion  rates  in  primary  education  for  girls  (47%) \ncompared with boys (52%). These differentials continue for lower and upper secondary education. The low rate of female enrollment \nin  lower  secondary  school  leads  to  significantly  lower  female  enrollment  in  teacher  training  colleges,  and  subsequently,  low \nrepresentation in the field of teaching, particularly in lower and upper secondary schools.  \n \nThe  same  situation  exists  at  universities.  In  terms  of  enrollment  at  CU,  data  shows  that  in  2008/09,  of  4,750  total  enrollment, \n1,918  students  were  female  (40.3%)  and  274  were  from  ethnic  groups  (37%).  However  when  income  data  is  factored  into  this \nequation, the female participation figure is considerable lower. Thus for the lowest income group, the data shows total enrollment of \n206, with 34 females (16.5%) and 41 ethnic origin students (20%). The data clearly show that the gender disparity for both samples \nis greater for students from ethnic rather than nonethnic groups. Poor students are severely underrepresented at CU. \n \n2.  Key Actions \n \nThe  Project  will  address  these  issues  through  implementation  of  pro-female  policies  and  strategic  plans.  These  include  effective \ntargeting of female quota students; maximizing female participation in workshops, scholarships, and other professional development \nactivities;  ensuring  gender  sensitivity  in  all  curriculum  materials;  and  providing  accommodation  and  facilities  at  CU  catering \nspecifically  to  the  needs  of  female  students.  A  gender  and  ethnic  groups  action  plan  was  prepared;  its  implementation  will  be \nmonitored by quarterly progress reports and semiannual, midterm, and project completion review missions.  \n \n\n  Gender and ethnic group action plan      \n\n  Other actions/measures      \n\n  No action/measure \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 10 \n\n57 \n\nIII. \n\nSOCIAL SAFEGUARD ISSUES AND OTHER SOCIAL RISKS \n\nStrategy to Address Issue \n\nLimited impact  Not significant.

This will be achieved by \nmore effectively targeting ethnic students; and increasing \nopportunities for ethnic groups to work as faculty members \nand university staff. \nThe Project will enhance employability of graduates from \nthe universities to be developed, which will lead to \nincreased employment opportunities. At the construction \nsites, employment opportunities for workers will be \nincreased. Labor standards will be maintained and basic \nfacilities (water and sanitation) will be provided for the \nconstruction workers. National labor laws against child labor \nor discriminatory practices will be complied with. \nNo negative impact. The Project will sharpen the targeting of \ndisadvantaged quota students, especially students from poor \nhouseholds and ethnic groups, by increasing living allowances.  \nNone. \n\nSignificant, \nLimited, No \nImpact \nNone \n\nLimited impact \n\nIssue \n\nInvoluntary \nResettlement \n\nIndigenous \nPeoples \n\nLabor \n\n  Employment  \n  opportunities \n  Labor \n  retrenchment \n  Core labor \nstandards \n\n \n\nAffordability \n\nNone. \n\nNone. \n\nOther Risks and/or \nVulnerabilities \nHIV/AIDS \nHuman trafficking \nOthers(conflict, \n  political instability, \n  etc), please \n  specify \n\nPlan or Other \nMeasures Included in \nDesign \n\n   Full Plan \n   Short Plan \n   Resettlement \nFramework \n\n \n\n   No Action \n   Gender and Ethnic  \n  Groups Action Plan \n   Other Action \n   Framework \n   No Action \n\n   Plan \n   Other Action \n   No Action \n\n   Action \n   No Action \n\n  Plan \n  Other Action \n   No Action \n\nIV.

These  include  achieving  equity, \nreducing gender and sociocultural disparities, overcoming barriers and obstacles for women and \nethnic groups, and ensuring equal access to high-quality and relevant higher education training. \nThe gender and ethnic groups action plan (GEGAP) is based on a gender analysis; an analysis \nof relevant ethnic group composition in the south of the Lao People's Democratic Republic (Lao \nPDR); a survey of female participation at Champasak University (CU), including student ethnic \nand  student  enrollment  and  graduation  data;  and  gender  composition  of  administrative  and \nacademic  staff  at  CU.  It  builds  upon  ongoing  initiatives  carried  out  in  previous  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)-supported  projects,  following  the  basic  principles  of  prioritizing \nresource  allocation  to  geographically  targeted  remote  ethnic  group  areas,  especially  where \ngender  disparities  tend  to  be  larger;  promoting  participation  of  ethnic  groups  and  females  in \nproject  activities;  promoting  gender-  and  ethnic-sensitive  curriculum,  materials,  and  policy  and \nstrategy development; and strengthening capacity of CU to address ethnic and gender concerns \nand equality in provision of higher education. The GEGAP follows regulations of the Lao PDR, \nand  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Gender  and  Development  (2003)  and  Policy  on  Indigenous  Peoples \n(1998). \n \n2. \nOverview  of  Gender  and  Ethnic  Groups.  Key  gender  issues  for  the  Project  include  \n(i)  an  imbalance  in  educational  attainment  at  upper  secondary  and  tertiary,  where  fewer  girls \nthan  boys  are  enrolled;  and  (ii)  an  imbalance  in  tertiary  teaching  staff  as  male  teachers \nsignificantly outnumber female teachers. The region surrounding CU contains a diverse range of \nethnic groups particularly in the upland regions more distant from Pakse. Sekong\u2019s population is \nmade  up  of  more  than  90%  non-Lao  ethnic  groups.

The  national  incidence  of \n5. \npoverty based on the poverty line is estimated at 46%; about 53% in rural areas. Regionally, the \nincidence of poverty is 53% in the rural north, 47% in the center, and 66% in the south. Extreme \npoverty is especially prevalent in the south.1 The poverty gap index confirms the general trends \nin the head-count ratio and illustrates that the south is the poorest region, with greater poverty in \nthe  rural  areas.  Table  A11.4  shows  the  distribution  of  poverty  by  geographic  region, \ndisaggregated into urban and rural sectors. Further, poverty is highest in areas that also have a \nlarge  proportion  of  people  from  small  ethnic  groups.  The  development  of  CU  civil  works  and \ncampus facilities, combined with the targeting of ethnic, female, and poverty-affected students, \nshould have a significant impact on poverty reduction for the southern region of the Lao PDR.  \n \n6. \nLegal Framework and Regulations. The Constitution of the Lao PDR, ratified in 1991, \nuses  the  term  \u201ccitizens  of  all  ethnicity\u201d  throughout  the  document.  It  specifically  recognizes  the \nneed  to  incorporate  the  concerns  of  ethnic  groups  in  developing  policy  in  all  sectors,  and  has \nreaffirmed  its  commitment  to  strengthen  the  rights  of  all  ethnic  groups  in  various  congresses, \nconferences, decrees, and laws since the 1980s (Articles 8 and 22). Promoting gender equality \nis  an  important  national  goal  as  reflected  in  the  National  Strategy  for  the  Development  of \nWomen (1998\u20132005), the 1991 Constitution (articles 22 and 24), and a number of international \ncommitments.  The  National  Commission  for  the  Advancement  of  Women  in  Lao  PDR  was \nestablished  in  1991  to  help  ensure  women\u2019s  equal  access  to  basic  services  and  productive \nresources  for  achieving  equity,  efficiency,  and  effectiveness  of  policies  and  projects.  The \ncommission develops the national strategy for the development of women and reports directly to \nthe Government. The Lao Women\u2019s Union helps implement the strategy.  \n \nThe  Government\u2019s  National  Growth  and  Poverty  Eradication  Strategy  (2004),  the \n7. \nGovernment\u2019s Sixth Socio-Economic Development Plan (2006\u20132010), Education Strategic Vision \n2000\u20132020,  Education  Sector  Development  Plan  (2006\u20132010),  and  National  Plan  of  Action  for \n\n                                                 \n1   Two poverty lines are defined: (i) the basic poverty line measures the household\u2019s ability to purchase a variety of \ngoods  beyond  food  and  dwelling  needs;  and  (ii)  the  extreme  poverty  line  measures  the  household\u2019s  ability  to \npurchase only the most absolute necessities: food, shelter, and clothing. \n\n \n\n\f60  \n\nAppendix 11 \n\n \n\nEducation  for  All  (EFA  Plan)  (2003\u20132015)  provide  guidelines  for  ensuring  equity  and  gender \nequality  including  access  to  education  and  skills  development,  especially  for  ethnic  girls  in  poor \nand disadvantaged areas. The EFA Plan and the Education Sector Development Plan both stress \ncritical targets regarding gender mainstreaming: (i) gender equality in education up to secondary \nschools, and (ii) curriculum and teacher training oriented to eliminating biases against girls.  \n \n\nTable A11.4: Incidence and Depth of Poverty, by Region and Sector, Lao PDR, 2002/03 \n \n\nPoverty \n\nTotal \n0.464\n0.404 \n0.598 \n0.461 \n\nRural \n0.527 \n0.469 \n0.662 \n0.530 \n\nHead-Count Ratioa \nUrban \n0.160\n0.257 \n0.288 \n0.239 \n\n \n \nRegion \nNorth \nCenter \nSouth \nAll \n \n \n \nNorth \nCenter \nSouth \nAll \na   Head-count ratio shows the percentage of the population falling into the categories of poverty and extreme poverty. \nb   Poverty gap index measures the average transfer of resources that the poor need to escape poverty.

Poverty  is,  in  many  ways,  a  reflection  of  lack  of \naccess to education and health care services; the poor suffer from lack of access, and lack of access contributes to \ntheir poverty. \nSource: World Bank. 2005.

Specific  actions  will  be  implemented  under \nthe  Project  to  actively  promote  the  inclusion  of  ethnic,  female,  and  poor  students  in  study \nprograms in higher education. These actions will contribute to the overall project outcome aimed \nto increase the number of students to 60,000 by 2015, of which 50% (or 30,000) will be female. \nTable A11.5 highlights specific actions by project output. \n \nImplementation  Arrangements.  A  vice  minister,  Ministry  of  Education  (MOE),  and \n9. \ndirector  general,  Department  of  Higher  Education,  will  oversee  GEGAP  implementation.  The \nCenter for Integrated Education (formerly the Gender and Ethnic Groups Education Unit) has an \nimportant  role  in  overseeing  gender  mainstreaming  efforts  in  education.  Representatives  from \nthe  Lao  Women\u2019s  Union  and  Lao  Front  for  National  Construction  will  facilitate  participation  by \ngirls, women, and ethnic groups in local project activities. International and national consulting \nservices  will  help  integrate  ethnic  and  gender  concerns  into  project  activities,  including  a \nnational gender and social development specialist for 6 person-months. They will work with the \nCenter for Integrated Education to establish sex- and ethnic-disaggregated indicators for project \nperformance monitoring and evaluation. Quarterly project progress reports will provide updates \non GEGAP implementation and its impact on the Project. The GEGAP will be reviewed during \nthe ADB review missions and the Project's midterm review mission. \n\n \n\n\fProject Output \nOutput 1: \nStrengthened \nmanagement, \nfinancing, and \ngovernance
