The \nreport  also  describes  proposed  technical  assistance  (TA)  for  Supporting  Social  Protection \nReforms, and if the Board approves the proposed loan, I, acting under the authority delegated to \nme by the Board, approve the TA.1 \n \nThe  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  approved  the  original  program  ($9  million  Asian \n2. \nDevelopment  Fund  [ADF]  grant)  and  project  ($3  million  ADF  grant)  in  2008,  which  were \ndesigned in the context of the 2008 food crisis to improve access to food by vulnerable and poor \nhouseholds.2 The  original  program,  which  included  the  design  and  implementation  of  a  food \nstamp  program  as  part  of  the  social  welfare  system,  has  exceeded  its  target  number  of \nbeneficiaries.3 The original project improved targeting, provided capacity building, and prepared \nstrategies to reform social welfare in Mongolia. ADB\u2019s contribution to the reform of social welfare \nhas  been  significant  at  both  policy  and  operational  levels.4 Progress  made  in  reforming  social \nwelfare  since  2009  includes  (i)  the  introduction  of  proxy  means  testing  to  target  the  poor, \n(ii) cancellation of several universal benefits, (iii) the introduction of the food stamp program as \nthe  first  poverty-targeted  benefit  in  Mongolia,  and  (iv)  passage  of  an  amended  Social Welfare \nLaw in January 2012 that legalized the reforms. \n \n3. \nThe  government  has  requested  ADB\u2019s  consideration  of  additional  financing  to  the \nongoing  project  to  continue  reforming  social  welfare  and  to  strengthen  social  insurance \nservices.  It  will  scale up  the  original  project  by  pursuing  the  reforms  initiated  in social  welfare. \nSocial welfare benefits will be further consolidated to reduce the complexity of the system and \nincrease its effectiveness. The additional financing will also support an expansion in the scope \nof the original project by improving the delivery of social insurance services and modernizing the \nsocial protection sector to adapt to a fast-growing economy.  \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\n4. \nIn Mongolia, high economic growth coexists with large numbers of vulnerable and poor \npopulations\u2014requiring  a  continuous  focus  on  social  welfare.5 Mongolia\u2019s  promising  economic \noutlook  and  the  prospect  of  increased  labor  participation  in  the  formal  sector  justify  the \nincreasing  focus  on  social  insurance.  In  July  2012,  the  newly  elected  government  issued  the \nGovernment Action Plan, 2012\u20132016, which aimed at introducing new and transparent financial \n                                                \n1   The revised design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  ADB. 2008. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Asian Development \nFund Grants to Mongolia for the Food and Nutrition Social Welfare Program and Project. Manila. The program was \ncompleted in December 2012. \n\n3  The food stamp program has reached  124,371 beneficiaries (65,972 females and 58,399 males), surpassing the \n\nproject outcome target of 100,000 beneficiaries. \n\n4  ADB  has  been  at  the  forefront  of  social  welfare  reforms  with  the  following:  ADB.  2001.

National Socio-Economic Household Survey. Ulaanbaatar. \n\n\f2 \n\nservices  and  advanced  information  technology  (IT)  tools  in  the  social  welfare  and  insurance \nsector. The government\u2019s intention is to address user dissatisfaction with insurance and social \nwelfare services. The Ministry of Population Development and Social Protection (MPDSP)  has \ntwo  main  attached  agencies\u2014the  Social  Insurance  General  Office  (SIGO)  in  charge  of \nmanaging  five  social  insurance  funds, 6 and  the  General  Office  for  Social  Welfare  Services \n(GOSWS)  in  charge  of  social  welfare  benefit  management.  SIGO  and  the  GOSWS  are  fairly \ndecentralized,  with  their  30  branch  offices  in  all  21  aimags  (provinces)  and  nine  districts  of \nUlaanbaatar, and services offered in all 352 soums (administrative subdivisions of the aimag) of \nMongolia.  \n \n5. \nSocial  welfare.  Social  welfare  has  undergone  major  reforms  since  2001  with  ADB \nsupport, but key issues such as fiscal sustainability and the impact of welfare benefits still need \nto  be  addressed  through  consolidation  of  social  welfare  benefits.  Social  welfare  includes  an \nexcessive number of benefits (more than 60), which lack proper targeting and are overlapping. \nThe absence of an effective, centrally operated management information system in the GOSWS \nleads  to  duplication  of  benefits,  limited  analysis,  and  other  inefficiencies.  Further  progress  in \nsocial welfare reforms requires better availability of data and information for more efficient and \neffective delivery of social welfare services. A major lesson is the need for sustained support, as \nreforming a sensitive sector such as social welfare requires long-term efforts and commitment. \n \nSocial  insurance.  The  population  coverage  of  each  of  the  five  social  insurance  funds \n6. \nmanaged  by  SIGO  varies.  All  funds  are  subsidized  by  the  government,  and  the  pension  and \nhealth insurance funds are contributory funds.7 The pension fund covered about 301,940 people \nat  the  end  of  2011.  The  MPDSP  has  initiated  reform  to  shift  from  a  single-layer  contributory \nsystem  to  a  multilayer  pension  system  encouraging  private  sector  involvement.  The  health \ninsurance  system,  covering  up  to  98%  of the  population,  albeit  with low financial  protection,  is \nundergoing  reforms.  These  include  better  governance,  more  managerial  autonomy,  and \nincreased  health  services  purchasing  capacity.8 With  recent  changes  in  the  economy  and  the \nchanging  living  conditions  of  Mongolians,  the  social  security  sector  strategy  needs  to  be \nassessed and updated to develop a consensus on the way forward to 2020. The social security \nsector strategy was last updated in 2003.9  \n    \nInformation  technology  systems.  The  IT  systems  of  SIGO  and  the  GOSWS  suffer \n7. \nfrom lack of automated procedures for reporting, poor connectivity to automate social services \nat  the  soum  and  aimag  levels,  and  a  multitude  of  databases,  which  complicate  data \nmanagement, analysis, and reporting.  SIGO is using an outdated software system that cannot \nsupport  international  accounting  standards  requirements  for  the  public  sector.  The  current \napproach  to  strictly  separate  IT  systems  for  the  GOSWS  and  SIGO  is  inefficient.  The  lack  of \ninformation  flow  and  availability  constrains  efficient  functioning  of  the  social  welfare  and \ninsurance  system.  Reporting  and  data  analytics  (business  intelligence)  lack  automated \nprocesses  in  SIGO,  the  GOSWS,  and  at  the  MPDSP  level\u2014creating  considerable  difficulty  in \nanalyzing the performance data of social welfare and insurance, and in preparing projections for \n\n                                                \n6   The  five  funds  are  the  (i)  pension  fund;  (ii)  unemployment  fund;  (iii)  health  insurance  fund;  (iv)  benefits  fund \n\n(sickness, maternal, and funeral grants); and (v) industrial accidents, occupational diseases insurance fund. \n\n7  Shared contributions of employers and employees (2% for health insurance and 7% for pension contributions each \n\nfrom employers and employees). \n\n8  ADB  is  preparing  capacity  development  TA  (effectiveness  expected  in  November  2013)  to  support  the \nimplementation  of  the  revised  citizens\u2019  health  insurance  law  to  be  passed  by  the  Parliament  within  2013.  ADB. \n2013. Technical Assistance to Mongolia for Strengthening the Health Insurance System. Manila. \n\n9  Social security  is  to  be  understood  as synonymous  with social  protection,  and includes social  welfare  and  social \n\ninsurance. \n\n \n\n\fpolicy analysis and development. Further, data security, disaster prevention measures, and the \nuse of licensed software are lacking. The World Bank is supporting efforts to upgrade selected \naspects of the social welfare IT system. IT processes for both the GOSWS and SIGO need to \nbecome  transparent,  with  web-based  interfaces,  and  stakeholder-centric.  Beneficiaries  and \nother  stakeholders  request  access  to  information  to  inquire  about  the  status  of  benefits \nprocessing,  capacity  to retrieve  information,  clear  grievance  and  complaints  mechanisms,  and \nsimplified procedures. \n \nBoth  SIGO  and  the  GOSWS  seem  adequately  staffed,  but  the  human  resources \n8. \ncapacity  will  need  to  be  strengthened  given  the  planned  IT  improvements.  Additional  IT \nhardware  (computer,  server,  digital  storage)  will  need  to  be  acquired  at  central  level,  aimag, \ndistrict, and soum level. This needs to be supported by proper IT budget allocation to implement \neffective  maintenance,  depreciation,  and  replacement  policies.10 About  50%  of  the  soums  are \nconnected  through  an  internet  network.  The  government  is  working  with  private  parties  to \nextend  network  connectivity  to  remote  soums.  Bandwidth,  which  seems  sufficient  for  SIGO  at \npresent, will need to be reassessed in light of the planned requirements of the IT system in the \nfuture.  \n \n9. \nperforming well.11 \n(i) \n\nThe  current  project  was  assessed  on  the  following  indicators  and  is  considered  to  be \n\nthe  proxy  means \n\nImplementation  results  against  expected  project  outputs.  All  outputs  under \ncomponent  1  (design  and  implementation  of  a  targeted  food  stamp  program) \nhave  been  achieved.  Nationwide  coverage  of \ntesting \nimplementation  was  achieved  in  July  2012  (1.1).  The  food  stamp  program  is \ninstitutionalized  and  functioning  (1.2). 12 Outputs  under  component  2  (capacity \ndevelopment  and  communication  strategy  for  the  food  stamp  program)  were \nachieved.  Capacity  development  tools  for  national  and  local  stakeholders  were \nimplemented  (2.1).  A  communication  strategy  was  adopted  and  implemented \nnationwide  (2.2).  Outputs  under  component  3  are  nearly  achieved.  A \nmethodology to measure the impact of food price increases was developed and \ndisseminated (3.1). Policy notes, a knowledge product, and recommendations to \nthe  government  have  been  prepared  (3.2).  Recommendations  on  the  early \nwarning  and  response  system  to  respond  to  social  shocks  were  prepared  and \nare awaiting the government\u2019s decision to set up the system (3.3).  \nImplementation  progress. Implementation progress is satisfactory. The current \nproject had achieved 98% of cumulative physical progress against 97% elapsed \ntime  by  8  November  2013.  Cumulative  contract  awards  and  disbursement  are \nconsistent with projections. \nSafeguard compliance. Safeguard classifications for environment, resettlement, \nand  indigenous  peoples  were  C.  All  requirements  have  been  met.  The  gender \naction plan  has  been  implemented  satisfactorily.  Progress on the gender  action \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n                                                \n10 SIGO has a policy to replace hardware every 5 years but most GOSWS hardware is 5\u20136 years old without a clear \n\nreplacement policy. \n\n11 ADB. 2011. Additional Financing. Operations Manual. OM H5/OP. Manila (para. 3). \n12 The initial results of the impact evaluation of the food stamp program show a significant increase in dietary diversity \nand a decrease in the number of months without adequate food supply, a significant reduction in negative coping \nstrategies  (e.g.,  debt),  a  decrease  in  self-reported  poverty,  and  food  insecurity  (ADB.  2011.  Impact  Evaluation \nStudy: Medicard and Food Stamp Programs in Mongolia. Manila). At the same time, the results show no significant \nimpact  on  household  consumption  (monetary)  or  caloric  increase.  In  total,  450,000  households  (1.7  million \nindividuals)  were covered  by  the  proxy  means test  survey. The  National  Socio-Economic  Household  Surveys  for \n2010\u20132012 show that  85% of food stamp eligible are poor\u2014performance in line with international benchmarking. \nThe remaining 15% (eligible non-poor) are the result of inaccuracies of the targeting methodology. \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\nplan was reviewed, and minimal changes made to two indicators to reflect actual \nimplementation  and  monitoring. The  proxy  means testing  database, food  stamp \ndistribution,  grievances,  and  monitoring  are \nin \naccordance with the gender action plan. \n\nfully  sex-disaggregated \n\n(iv)  Management  of  risks.  Risks  were  managed  successfully.  The  report  and \nrecommendation of the President for the original project identified (a) food safety \nnets  used  as  a  political  tool,  (b)  resistance  to  change  in  the  existing  social \nwelfare  system,  (c)  the  decision  to  expand  or  prolong  the  food  stamp  program \nbased  on  recommendations  from  the  pilot  approach,  (d)  lack  of  coordination \namong  ministries  and  levels  of  government,  and  (e)  the  risks  that  the \nrecommendations  on  the  results  from  pilot  testing  will  not  be  turned  into  policy \nreforms. Mitigation measures were implemented and no further risk has surfaced.  \nProject  performance  rating. The current project is rated on track in the project \nperformance rating. \n\n(v) \n\nthe  original  project,  and  no  changes \n\n \n10. \nThe  additional  financing  is  considered  to  meet  the  four  eligibility  criteria  for  additional \nfinancing. 13  First,  ADB  reviewed  the  original  project  in  October  2012.  It  confirmed  the \nsatisfactory  performance  of \nin  approaches  or \nmethodologies were envisioned.14 Accordingly, the original project remains technically feasible, \neconomically viable, and financially sound. Second, the government accords high priority to the \noriginal  project  as  proposed  to  be  expanded  through  the  additional  financing.  Additional \nfinancing will be crucial in meeting a key reform in the Government Action Plan, 2012\u20132016 to \ndeliver  social  protection  services  to  citizens  efficiently  and  without  bureaucratic  difficulties,  as \nacknowledged  by  the  government\u2019s  request  for  additional  financing.  Third,  the  revised  project \noutcome  will  continue  improving  social  welfare  services  started  under  the  original  project  and \nextend to social insurance services, while the output related to preparing a package of reforms \nof social welfare will be expanded to cover social insurance. These changes are consistent with \nthe revised project\u2019s development objectives. Fourth, the expanded project and its outcome are \nconsistent  with  the  inclusive  social  development  pillar  of  the  current  country  partnership \nstrategy, 2012\u20132016 as well as with the ongoing reform efforts of the government.15  \n \n11. \nThe additional financing meets the three criteria for priority consideration: (i) the project \nis  performing  well  (para.  9);  (ii)  there  is  a  high  degree  of  project  readiness  to  implement  the \nadditional financing; and (iii) developing social welfare and insurance services that are effective, \nefficient,  transparent,  and  user-centered  is  highly  innovative  in  the  context  of  Mongolia  and \ncould have a demonstration effect for other sectors.  \n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n12. \nThe impact and outcome will be revised. The impact of the overall project (including the \nadditional  financing)  will  be  improved  social  equity,  less  poverty,  better  social  risks  mitigation \nand prevention, and improved food security. The outcome will be more efficient and transparent \ndelivery  of  social  welfare  and  insurance  services  (including  support  to  food  consumption), \nthrough strengthened policy, systems, and IT. The outputs will be retained, except for output 3.2 \nof the original project, which will be expanded to include IT improvements and social protection. \n \n\n                                                \n13 ADB. 2011.

The  implementing  agency \nchairs the steering committee and is responsible for procurement under the original project. In 2009, the choice of \nthe  MOF  as  the  executing  agency  was  required  as  the  original  program  and  project  were  part  of  a  wider \ngovernment plan led by the MOF to address the food and fuel crisis. The additional financing focuses primarily on \ntechnical matters and is no longer designed in a crisis context. Therefore, it is relevant to designate the MPDSP as \nthe executing agency of the overall project. The Ministry of Economic Development  concurred with the change of \nexecuting agency.  \n\nb   The MPDSP has advised that the procurement will be conducted by the Government Procurement Agency (GPA). \nSuch  arrangements  and  the  respective  role  of  the  GPA  and  the  MPDSP  will  be  confirmed  during  project \nimplementation subject to ADB\u2019s assessment of the GPA capacity and resources. \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n\n                                                \n17 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \nA. \n\n \n\nIII. \n\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n\n17. \nADB  will  provide  capacity  development  TA  for  Supporting  Social  Protection  Reforms. \nThe  TA  is  estimated  to  cost  $0.5  million,  which  will  be  financed  on  a  grant  basis  by  ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-V). The TA will finance consulting services, capacity \nbuilding for the MPDSP, and contingencies.18 The MPDSP will be the executing agency for the \nadditional  financing  and the TA.19  The TA  will  be  implemented from  30  June  2014  to  30  May \n2017.20  \n \n\nIV. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nTechnical \n \n18. \nTechnology solutions will be introduced under the IT component to ensure the efficiency \nand transparency of social welfare and insurance services. Web-based IT will be designed and \nimplemented to ensure access to data from all levels, automated reporting systems, strict user \naccess control,  an  integrated security framework,  business  intelligence  software,  infrastructure \nfor backup and disaster recovery, an IT system catalog, and a centralized help desk for all IT-\nrelated  issues.  Capacity  building  will  be  provided.  A  link  to  the  intersectoral  poverty  database \nwill  allow  improved  targeting  of  welfare  programs  of  different  ministries  and  government \nagencies. \n  \nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n \nThe  economic analysis  evaluated  the  economic viability  of  the  project  as  a whole.  The \n19. \nanalysis  covers  the  macroeconomic  context  to  review  the  potential  for  the  government  to \ncontinue  to  finance  the  project  activities  in  the  longer  term  following  project  completion.  The \nquantifiable economic costs and benefits for the upgraded IT processes and systems have been \nevaluated.  Benefits  will  lead  to  productivity  gain,  cost  savings  for  the  beneficiaries,  and \nimproved allocation of human resources at the agencies level. The evaluation of the economic \nbenefit  of  reformed  social  welfare  and  strengthened  social  protection  cannot  be  quantified \nmonetarily  at  this  stage;  an  evaluation  will  be  possible  once  the  efficiency  of  the  current \ntargeting  is  analyzed  and  new  measures  are  defined  during  the  envisaged  project.  Using \nconservative  estimates  of  project  implementation,  the  baseline  results  show  an  economic \ninternal  rate  of  return  (EIRR)  of  14.85%  without  taking  into  account  unquantifiable  economic \nbenefits  for  the  reformed  social  welfare  and  strengthened  social  protection  output.  The  EIRR \nwas tested through sensitivity analysis using a 20% decrease in economic benefits as the worst-\ncase  scenario  for  all  economic  benefits.  Under  these  assumptions,  the  EIRR  is  11.16%.  The \nproject is considered economically viable. \n \nThe project has no revenue-earning component, so a financial cost\u2013benefit analysis was \n20. \nnot necessary. The financial sustainability of the project was assessed at the fiscal and project \nlevel. An analysis of recent and projected government expenditures was undertaken to evaluate \n\n                                                \n18 Proceeds  of  the  TA  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Technical  Assistance  Disbursement  Handbook \n(2010,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  Consultants  will  be  recruited  under  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants (2013, as amended from time to time). \n\n19 The government will provide in-kind counterpart support in the form of office accommodation, remuneration and per \ndiem  of  counterpart  staff,  and  administrative  support.  The  project  implementation  unit  will  provide  day-to-day \nadministrative  support  to  the  MPDSP.  A  capacity  assessment  confirmed  MPDSP\u2018s  capacity  to  handle  financial \nmatters and recruitment of consultants. \n\n20 Technical Assistance (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n\fGovernance \n\nthe  potential  impact  of  the  project  on  the  budget  of  the  MPDSP.  The  MPDSP,  GOSWS,  and \nSIGO  will  contribute  counterpart  funding  and  cover  the  project\u2019s  operation  and  maintenance \n(O&M) costs. The government\u2019s annual share of project costs will average $1.00 million, or less \nthan 0.10% of the population development and social protection sector annual budget in 2012. \nThe  recurrent  costs  of  the  project  are  estimated  to  be  about  $0.67 million  per  annum  and \ninclude O&M of IT systems. The annual O&M cost to be borne by the MPDSP will not exceed \n0.005% of its current expenditure. The counterpart funding and O&M costs are considered both \nfinancially  sustainable  and  affordable.  Considering  an  average  depreciation  value  of  $2.00 \nmillion per annum for the project investment, the recurrent cost impact will be $2.67 million per \nannum,  which  represents  less  than  0.01%  of  the  total  recurrent  cost  of  2012.  A  financial \nmanagement assessment concluded that the MPDSP is experienced in managing ADB projects \nand is prepared for project implementation. The financial management analysis identified issues \nthat will be addressed through the maintenance of project accounts by a project implementation \nunit  and  through  external  audits  for  the  project  duration.  The  government  has  committed  to \nprovide the necessary funds to ensure that the investment benefits are not lost.  \n  \nC. \n \n21. \nThe  MPDSP  is  a  long-term  partner  of  ADB  since  2001.  IT  improvements  and  better \nsocial funds management will substantially improve the transparency of financial transactions. A \nprocurement  capacity  assessment  conducted  for  the  MPDSP,  GOSWS,  and  SIGO  confirmed \ntheir general ability to conduct procurement in compliance with ADB policy and relevant national \nlaws and regulations on public procurement. Financial management assessments conducted for \nthe  MPDSP,  GOSWS,  and  SIGO  noted  that  all  the  agencies  have  staff  with  adequate \naccounting  skills;  computerized  financial  accounting  and  reporting  systems;  and  accounting, \nfinancial,  and  project  monitoring  procedures.  A  project  implementation  unit  will  support  the \nMPDSP in project financial matters, procurement, and recruitment of consultants.  The Ministry \nof Finance will arrange annual external audits for the project. The MPDSP, GOSWS, and SIGO \nare subject to annual auditing conducted by independent auditors.  \n \n22. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government  and  the  MPDSP.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary \nmeasures are described in the project administration manual (footnote 17). \n \nD. \n \nThe poor and socially excluded will particularly benefit from the project through improved \n23. \nsystems,  better  targeting,  and  increased  analytical  capabilities  and  capacity  of  the  MPDSP  to \nbetter design benefit coverage and plan for the future. Members of the social insurance systems \nwill  benefit  from  more  effective  and  transparent  services.  The  additional  financing  project  is \nclassified under effective gender mainstreaming. Mongolia has a wide range of social protection \nbenefits with social welfare entitlements designed specifically to address strengthening the role \nof women in society. To date, gender analysis of social protection policies or programs has not \nbeen  carried  out.  The  additional  financing  will  build  on  gender  aspects  developed  under  the \noriginal project by updating the social protection strategy to ensure that the gender implications \nof social protection policies are identified and policy reforms built into the strategy. The gender \naction plan was reviewed and updated in light of the additional financing. \n\nPoverty and Social  \n\n \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\nSafeguards \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\nThe  current  project  and  additional \n\nE. \n \n24. \nfinancing  will  not  cause  any  environment, \nresettlement,  or  indigenous  peoples\u2019  impact.  Therefore,  the  overall  project  and  additional \nfinancing remain category C for environment, resettlement, and indigenous peoples. No further \nactions  are  required.  The  assessment  of  potential  environmental  implications  of  the  original \nproject is accessible from the list of linked documents to the original report and recommendation \nof the President (footnote 2). \n \nF. \n \n25. \nThe overall benefits and impacts are expected to outweigh the costs and risks involved. \nThe  main  risks  are  (i)  resistance  by  the  public  and  decision  makers  to  rationalize  the  social \nwelfare  system,  which  will  be  mitigated  through  participative  processes  and  effective \ncommunication;  (ii)  SIGO  and  the  GOSWS  oppose  reorganization  of  the  IT  department  for \nincreased  efficiency,  which  will  be  mitigated  by  technical  and policy  dialogue  with  the  MPDSP \nand  the  two  agencies;  and  (iii)  the  government  provides  insufficient  resources  for  the  O&M  of \nthe upgraded IT systems, which will be addressed by a covenant in the loan agreement on the \nprovision  of  sufficient  counterpart  funding  to  cover  maintenance  costs.  Major  risks  and \nmitigating measures are described in detail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.21 \n \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n \n26. \nThe government has assured ADB that implementation of the project shall conform to all \nthose  concerning  anticorruption  measures,  gender, \napplicable  ADB  policies \nprocurement,  consulting services,  disbursements,  and  safeguards  as  described  in  detail  in the \nproject  administration  manual  and  loan  documents.
