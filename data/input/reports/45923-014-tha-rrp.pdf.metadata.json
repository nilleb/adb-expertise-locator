ADB  provided  financial  assistance  to  BCP\u2019s  first,  38-\nmegawatt  (MW)  solar  power  project  in  2010  on  a  corporate  finance  basis.1 The  first  project  is \nexpected to become fully operational by July 2012 and play an important demonstration role as \none of the first utility-scale solar power plants in Thailand.2 BCP plans to develop an additional \n80  MW  of  solar  power  capacity  under  its  subsidiary,  the  Bangchak  Solar  Energy  Company \nLimited (BSE), to become the largest solar power company in Thailand.  \n \n3. \nIf approved, the project will be the first time ADB mobilizes CTF cofinancing for a private \nsector project.3 The CTF provides scaled-up financing to demonstrate, deploy, and transfer low-\ncarbon technologies with significant potential to avoid greenhouse gas emissions over the long \nterm. It is channeled and administered through multilateral development banks, including ADB, \nand  is  one  of  the  largest  funds  available  to  help  developing  countries  fill  gaps  in  financing \nclimate change mitigation.  \n \n4. \nADB will build on its recent experience to play a crucial role in helping BCP achieve its \nfirst  limited-recourse  project  financing  for  renewable  energy.  Project  finance  is  a  logical  next \nstep  as  it  is  the  most  appropriate  form  of  financing  for  renewable  power  projects,  despite  its \ncomplexity.  Project  finance  can  strengthen  the  financial  viability  of  clean  energy  projects  and \noptimize their cash flow through longer tenors and advantageous debt sizing. The project will be \nmade  possible  by  the  confluence  of  three  main  factors:  (i)  BCP\u2019s  strategic  focus  and \ncommitment  to  renewable  energy;  (ii)  the  Government  of  Thailand\u2019s  support  through  a  strong \npublic\u2013private  partnership  regulatory  and  legal  framework  combined  with  a  sufficient  tariff \nregime;  and  (iii)  ADB\u2019s  long-term,  fixed-rate  financing  in  local  currency  combined  with  the \nexpected  CTF  cofinancing,  which  reduces  the  additional  costs  and  risks  associated  with \ninvestments in solar power. \n \n5. \nAs  of  January  2012,  Thailand\u2019s  installed  power  generation  capacity  was  31,447  MW. \nGeneration depends heavily on conventional fuels, with 64% produced by natural gas and 22% \nproduced by coal and lignite. Natural gas has traditionally been Thailand\u2019s reliable and low-cost \nsource of energy, but growing demand and dwindling reserves in the Gulf of Thailand mean the \n\n                                                \n1  ADB.  2010.  Report  and  Recommendation  to  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors:  Proposed  Loans  and \n\nTechnical Assistance for the Bangchak Solar Power Project. Manila (Loan 2628-THA and EI 7311-THA). \n\n2  The  project  consists  of  two  plants  with  a  capacity  of  8  MW  and  30  MW.  The  commercial  operations  date  was \n\n3  For \n\ninformation  on \n\nthe  CTF, \n\nthe  Climate \n\nInvestment  Funds  website  can  be  accessed  at \n\ndelayed by heavy flooding in 2011. \n\nhttp://www.climateinvestmentfunds.org. \n\n\f 2 \n\ncountry must  begin the  transition toward  secure alternative sources.  Fortunately,  Thailand has \nabundant renewable energy sources: biomass, biogas, mini-hydro, solar, and wind. Using these \ndomestic  sources  of  renewable  energy  can  boost  Thailand\u2019s  energy  security,  save  foreign \nexchange,  and  protect  the  country  from  global  price  fluctuations.  As  part  of  its  strategy  to \ndiversify  the  energy  mix  and  promote  renewable  energy,  the  government  prepared  the \nAlternative  Energy  Development  Plan,  2012\u20132021,  which  the  cabinet  approved  on  30 \nDecember  2011,  and  set  a  new  target  of  generating  25%  of  primary  commercial  energy  from \nrenewable energy sources by 2021. This would reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 76 million \ntons per year. This target includes 9,201 MW of renewable energy capacity by 2021, of which \n2,000 MW is solar. As of 2011, only 169 MW of solar power capacity had reached commercial \noperation.  To  reach  the  target,  the  plan  will  encourage  private  sector  development  and  the \npromotion of new technologies. \n \n6. \nTo  complement  its  renewable  energy  strategy,  the  Ministry  of  Energy  decentralizes \npower  generation  mainly  by  supporting  the  country\u2019s  small  power  producer  (SPP)  and  very \nsmall  power  producer  (VSPP)  programs,  which  are  public\u2013private  partnerships  that  buy \nrenewable  energy from power  plants  to  provide  clean electricity  to the grid. The  SPP  program \nallows  private  developers  to  build,  own,  and  operate  10\u201390 MW power  projects  and  enter  into \npower purchase agreements (PPAs) with the Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand. Under \nthe  VSPP  program,  producers  of  up  to  10  MW  may  sell  power  to  the  Metropolitan  Electricity \nAuthority or the Provincial Electricity Authority (PEA). Renewable energy SPPs and VSPPs are \neligible for a feed-in tariff (or \u201cadder\u201d) in addition to the wholesale electricity price.  \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \n\n2. \n\nThe Borrower and Sponsor \n\n \n7. \nThe  project  will  be  developed  and  operated  by  BSE,  a  special-purpose  company \nincorporated  in Thailand  that  is  100%  owned  by  BCP.  BCP  is  a  leading  integrated  oil  refining \nand distribution company in Thailand with a long track record of adhering to principles of good \ncorporate governance and strong commitment to the environment and social responsibility. BCP \nowns and operates an oil refinery in Bangkok with a capacity of 120,000 barrels per day. BCP\u2019s \nretail  business  consists  of  a  network  of  over  1,000  service  stations,  making  BCP  the  third-\nlargest gasoline distribution company in Thailand and the leader in green fuels such as gasohol \nand biodiesel. BCP has become a role model in Thailand for its success in developing internal \nmechanisms that  enhance transparency  and  accountability,  including  comprehensive reporting \non environmental and social indicators.4 BCP has initiated a proactive zero-carbon strategy that \ntracks  and  monitors  its  carbon  footprint  companywide  and  implements  strategies  to  offset \ncarbon emissions with the objective of reaching zero emissions. \n \nBCP\u2019s  major  shareholder  is  the  national  oil  company,  PTT  Public  Company  Limited, \n8. \nwhich  owns  27%.  Other  shareholders  are  the  Ministry  of  Finance  (10%)  and  the  public  (63%) \ninvesting  through  the  Stock  Exchange  of  Thailand.  In  2011,  BCP  generated  B158.6  billion  in \nrevenue  and net  income  of  B5.6  billion.  Shareholders\u2019 funds  are B29.9  billion  and  total  assets \nB61.6 billion. BCP has a corporate rating from TRIS Rating Company Limited of A\u2013/stable.5 \n\n                                                \n4   BCP\u2019s  corporate  social  responsibility  reporting  comprises  full  disclosure  of  its  resource  use  and  environmental \nfootprint, as well as the annual publication of environmental management accounting, which counts carbon dioxide \nemissions  and  other  factors  as  costs  to  BCP.  It  publicizes  its  emissions  and  accident  rates  to  the  public  on \nbillboards  and  at  information  centers.  BCP  has  won  numerous  awards  for  its  high  standards  of  corporate \ngovernance and corporate social responsibility. \n\n5  See  Implementation  Arrangements  (accessible  from  the  list  of  linked  documents  in  Appendix  2)  for  more \n\ninformation on BCP. \n\n\f \n\n3 \n\n \n10. \nADB\u2019s  review  of  BSE,  a  wholly  owned  subsidiary  of  BCP  incorporated  in  Thailand  to \noperate solar projects, did not give cause to believe that it was established or is being used to \nevade taxes across borders, launder money, or finance terrorism in the jurisdictions involved. \n \n \nB. \n \n\nDevelopment Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n\n1. \n\nImpact \n\n \n11. \nThe  project's  impact  will  be  the  diversification  of  Thailand's  energy  mix  through  the \naddition  of  renewable energy  capacity6,  helping the  country  progress  towards  its  clean  energy \ntargets.7 To  achieve  sustainable  long-term  economic  growth,  Thailand  is  promoting  alternative \nsources of energy for power generation such as solar, and is beginning the transition to a low-\ncarbon economy. Solar is a secure, reliable, and sustainable source of electricity that diversifies \nthe country\u2019s energy mix, strengthening energy security and reducing reliance on fossil fuel. \n \n13. \nThe  project  also  contributes  to  the  acceleration  and  expansion  of  private  sector \ninvestment  in  clean  energy  infrastructure  in  Thailand.  It  is  expected  that  the  successful \nimplementation of the project and viable returns will attract other private sector investors in solar \nenergy projects. \n \n\n2. \n\nOutcome \n\n \nThe  project's  outcome  is  the  demonstrated  viability  and  sustainability  of  a  large  solar \n14. \nproject in the private sector. The amount of carbon dioxide emissions avoided is an indicator for \nthe outcome, in addition to the usual financial and operational indicators. \n \n\n3. \n\nOutput \n\nThe output is the installation and operation of 32 MW of solar power generation.8 \n\nAlignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n\n1. \n\nConsistency with Strategy 2020 \n\n \n16. \nADB\u2019s  Strategy  2020  supports  development  that  is  environmentally  sustainable  and \nsupported  by  the  private  sector  to  meet  growing  energy  demand  in the  region,  capitalizing  on \nADB\u2019s  operating  strengths  in  infrastructure  development,  finance,  and  other  areas. 9  The \nstrategy  supports  the  expansion  of  environment-friendly  technologies  for  clean  and  efficient \nenergy  generation  and  use,  as  well  as  a  larger  role  for  the  private  sector  in  infrastructure \nfinancing through public\u2013private partnerships. \n \n\n2. \n\nConsistency with the Country Strategy \n\n                                                \n6  With  this  project  of  32  MW,  ADB  will  have  contributed  to  125  MW  of  solar  energy  capacity  in  Thailand.  Earlier \n\nprojects are Natural Energy Development Limited (55 MW) and Bangchak (38 MW).  \n\n7   The  government has  established  clean  energy  targets of 2,000  MW  of solar  power  by 2021  and  25% of primary \n\ncommercial energy from renewable sources by 2021. \n8  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n9  ADB.  2008.  Strategy  2020:  The  Long-Term  Strategic  Framework  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank,  2008\u20132020. \n\nManila. \n\n \n\n \n15. \n \n \nC. \n \n\n\f 4 \n\n \n17. \nADB\u2019s  country  partnership  strategy  for  Thailand,  2007\u20132011  has  three  core  strategic \nareas:  infrastructure,  environmental  sustainability,  and  capital  markets. 10 The  government\u2019s \nAlternative  Energy  Development  Plan,  approved  by  the  cabinet  on  30  December  2011,  notes \nthe immense energy potential of solar radiation in Thailand and the energy imports that can be \navoided through its use, with private sector investment. The project supports the government\u2019s \nlong-term  objective  for  the  Thailand  Clean  Technology  Fund  Investment  Plan  to  utilize  CTF \nresources to support renewable energy projects in the private sector.11 \n \n\n3. \n\nConsistency with the Energy Policy \n\n \n18. \nThe  project  is  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  Energy  Policy,  which  emphasizes  investments  in \nenergy  efficiency,  renewable energy  projects,  and wider  access  to  energy.12 In  2013,  ADB  will \nraise  its  clean  energy  investment  target  to  $2  billion  per  year  from  the  present  $1  billion  to \naccelerate  low-carbon  growth  and  reduce  regional  greenhouse  gas  emissions.  The  policy \nunderscores ADB\u2019s continued financial and technical support for projects that qualify for carbon \ncredits under the Clean Development Mechanism of the Kyoto Protocol. Further, under the Asia \nSolar Energy Initiative, ADB is committed to achieving 3,000 MW of new solar power projects by \n2013, providing up to $2.25 billion in financing and leveraging an additional $6.75 billion. \n \n\n4. \n\nLessons from Previous Operations \n\n \n19. \nIn  2010,  ADB  approved  financing  for  two  solar  power  projects  in  Thailand;  the  Natural \nEnergy Development Solar Power Project13 and the Bangchak Solar Power Project (footnote 1). \nBoth projects will play important demonstration roles in Thailand\u2019s nascent solar power industry. \nThe  first  Bangchak  Solar  Power  Project  was  affected  by  floods  in  2011,  illustrating  the \nimportance  of  climate-proofing  projects.  The  project\u2019s  civil  works  will  ensure  that  physical  and \nhydrological  design  assumptions  take  into  account  the  changes  predicted  for  precipitation \npatterns and the severity and frequency of floods due to climate change. \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \n \nD. \n \n20. \n \n\nTable 3 summarizes the implementation arrangements (footnote 9). \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nTable 3: Summary of Implementation Arrangements \n\nAspects \nRegulatory framework \n\nManagement \n\nArrangements \nThe  project  is  being  developed  as  a  public\u2013private  partnership  under  Thailand\u2019s \nVery Small Power Producer program, which utilizes renewable energy from private \nsector power plants with capacity of up to 10 MW to provide clean electricity to the \ngrid. \nThe  project  will be  developed  and managed  by  BSE, a  special-purpose  company \nincorporated in Thailand that is 100% owned by BCP.
