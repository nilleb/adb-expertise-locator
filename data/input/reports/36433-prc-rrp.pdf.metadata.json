An  environmental  impact  assessment  was  completed  and \nthe  summary  was  circulated  to  the  Asian  Development  Bank\u2019s  (ADBs) \nBoard of Directors on 15 February 2006. \n \n\nincludes \n\nreducing \n\n \nRationale \n\n \nProject Description  The Taiyuan\u2013Zhongwei Railway (TZR) Project (the Project) is located in \nthe central part of Shanxi province and the northwestern part of Shaanxi \nand Ningxia province\u2014a relatively poor area. The Project is designed to \npromote  sustainable  economic  growth  by  constructing  944  kilometers \n(km) of railway line from Taiyuan in Shanxi to Zhongwei and Yinchuan in \nNingxia.  The  Project  will  (i)  develop  an  efficient,  safe,  affordable,  and \nenvironmentally sustainable railway transport system in the region; and \n(ii)  facilitate  the  creation  of  additional  employment  and  income-\ngenerating opportunities, thus benefiting poor residents.  \n \nThe  Project  reflects  ADB\u2019s  railway  sector  operational  strategy  for  the \nrailway  network  constraints  and \nPRC,  which \npromoting  sustainable  economic  growth  in  poor  areas  not  served  by \nrailways.  The  Project  is  in  line  with  the  Government\u2019s  western \ndevelopment  strategy  to  provide  less  developed  regions  with  better \ninfrastructure  to  facilitate  economic  growth,  thereby  increasing  the \nopportunity for people to improve their living standards.  \n \nThe  interior  regions  of  the  PRC  have  not  benefited  as  much  from \neconomic  growth  and  reforms  as  the  east  coast;  in  fact,  the  gap \nbetween  economic  and  social  development  has  increased.  Transport \nconstraints  and  high  logistics  costs  are  two  factors  contributing  to \nregional economic disparities, and two of the constraints preventing the \nwestern region from capitalizing on its comparative advantages. \n \nThe Project is (i) the first east\u2013west railway line linking Shanxi, Shaanxi, \nand  Ningxia  provinces;  and  (ii)  the  shortest  east\u2013west  corridor  linking \nBeijing, Huanghua, Qingdao, and other major cities and ports in the east \nto Yinchuan, Zhongwei, Lanzhou, and Urumqui in the west on its way to \nKazakhstan. The proposed alignment for the TZR is 100\u2013500 km shorter \nthan the existing route passing through the Longhai and Baolan railway \nlines.  Traversing  Shanxi,  Shaanxi  Provinces,  and  Ningxia  Autonomous \nRegion,  the  proposed  railway  line  will  connect  with  the  Beijing\u2013\nShenzhen,  Qingdao\u2013Shijiazhuang,  Qinhuangdao\u2013Tianjin  main  lines  in \nthe  east;  and  Baotou\u2013Wuhai\u2013Lanzhou,  Baotou\u2013Suide\u2013Xi\u2019an,  and \nUrumqui\u2013Wuwei\u2013Zhongwei, main lines in the west. The Project will also \nhelp  to  promote  regional  cooperation,  as  this  is  the  shortest  east\u2013west \ncorridor linking the PRC to Europe. \n \nThe  Project\u2014a  joint  venture  railway  between  the  Ministry  of  Railways \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\fii \n\n \n\n \nImpact and \nOutcome \n\n(MOR) and Shanxi, Shaanxi, and Ningxia provincial governments (SPG, \nfinancial \nSAPG,  NHAR)\u2014will  have  substantial  managerial  and \nautonomy.  The  Project  will  contribute  to  changing  railway  enterprises \nfrom  cost  centers  in  a  planned  economy  to  profit  centers  in  an \nincreasingly  competitive \ntransport  market.  The  components  are \nformulated in line with MOR\u2019s 2004 railway development plan. \n \nThe  Project  will  remove  a  transport  constraint  to  sustainable  economic \ngrowth. Providing economic railway transportation in the unserved, less-\ndeveloped, and poor areas will help create the conditions necessary for \ndeveloping  local  resources  and  generating  employment  and  income-\nenhancing opportunities to raise living standards in the project area.  \n \ninvolved  participatory  processes.  Extensive \nProject  preparation \nconsultations were held with all the main stakeholders, including various \naffected people, potential beneficiaries, village leaders, women\u2019s groups, \nlocal  ethnic  bureaus,  and  local  governments  in  the  project  area. \nHousehold surveys were carried out, and participatory workshops were \norganized  in  the  project  area  to  understand  public  opinion  about  the \nProject  and  provide \nthe  social  and  environmental \nassessments. \n \nThe  Project  comprises  the  following  components:  (i)  construction  of \n520 km  double  track  electrified  standard  gauge  Class  I  railway  from \nTaiyuan  to  Dingbian,  232  km  electrified  single  track  from  Dingbian  to \nZhongwei,  and  192  km  electrified  single  track  from  Dingbian  to \nYinchuan;  (ii)  construction  of  41  new  railway  stations  complete  with \nfacilities; (iii) safety initiatives, including provision of modern technology \nand  equipment  for  enhancing  safety;  (iv)  signaling,  e-governance  and \nmanagement information system; (v) provision of training on the use and \nland  acquisition  and \nmaintenance  of  modern  equipment; \nresettlement;  (vii)  environmental  protection  and  mitigation  of  adverse \nenvironmental  effects; \nfor  construction \nsupervision,  monitoring  and  evaluation,  and  marketing  and  business \ndevelopment; and (ix) strengthening of institutional capabilities. The key \ninputs needed for project implementation include civil works, equipment, \nconsultants, and staff of MOR and the Project Company.  \n \nThe investment cost of the Project is estimated at $3.753 billion.  \n\n(viii)  consulting  services \n\ninputs \n\n(vi) \n\nfor \n\n \nA  loan  of  $300 million  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources  will  be \nprovided  under  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based \nlending  facility.  The  loan  will  have  a  26-year  term  including  a  grace \nperiod of 6 years, an interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nLIBOR-based  lending  facility,  a  commitment  charge  of  0.75%  per \nannum,  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  set  forth  in  the  draft  loan \nagreement. \n \nUntil 31 December 2012 \n \n \n30 June 2012 \n\n \nProject Investment \nPlan \n \nFinancing Plan \n\n \nPeriod of \nUtilization \n \nEstimated Project \nCompletion Date \n \nExecuting Agency  Ministry of Railways \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\niii \n\ntasks  and  be  responsible \n\nimplement  adequate  and \n\nin  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on \n\n \nThe Project will be implemented over 6 years.

MOR will engage and finance domestic consulting services \nfor project design, construction supervision, construction quality control, \nenvironmental supervision, procurement, and monitoring and evaluation \nof the safeguard aspects of the Project in accordance with government \nprocedures acceptable to ADB. \n \nThe  Project  will  (i) provide  the  shortest  land  route  between  Taiyuan, \nYulin,  Zhongwei,  and  Yinchuan\u2014key  economic  centers  of  Shanxi, \nShaanxi, and Ningixia provinces\u2014enabling railway users to benefit from \nlower transport costs and shorter travel distances and times; (ii) increase \nthe  corridor\u2019s  capacity,  benefiting  consumers  and  producers  of  goods \nand  services  through  the  provision  of  timely  and  efficient  transport \nservices  and  lower  logistics  costs;  (iii) generate  direct  and  indirect \nemployment in the project-influenced area, and create jobs and income-\nearning  opportunities  (the  construction  and  operation  of  the  railway  will \nemploy  much  local  unskilled  labor);  (iv) provide  an  area  that  lacked \nadequate  cost-efficient  transportation  services  with  access  to  broader \nmarkets;  and  (v) stimulate  local  development  through  small  business \nopportunities,  tourism,  railway  station  area  development,  and  other \ninfrastructure elements to maximize benefits to local areas.  \n\nThe major project beneficiaries will be (i) passengers, including tourists, \nwho will benefit from affordable, faster, and safer trips; (ii) freight users \nwho will switch from the existing road and benefit from more affordable, \nfaster, and safer trips; (iii) local residents who will benefit from the lower \nprices  of  commodities  and  services  transported  by  the  project  railway; \n(iv) local  labor  involved  in  construction  work  and  supply  of  materials \nduring  implementation,  and  loading/unloading  during  the  railway\u2019s \noperation;  (v) local  farmers  who  will  be  able  to  sell  their  products  at \nmarket prices without paying a high margin to a transport intermediary; \n(vi) manufacturers and traders who can increase production capacity or \nestablish businesses, and will transport their goods and services by the \nfrom \nrailway;  and  (vii) local  governments,  which  will  benefit \nthe \nincreased \nlocal  area  development  and \nincreased  opportunity \nrevenues. \n \nThe Project will benefit about 6.5 million people living in the project area. \nThe poverty and social assessment looked at the 22 counties/districts, of \n\nfor \n\n \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\n \nProcurement \n\n \nConsulting \nServices \n\nProject Benefits \nand Beneficiaries \n\n \n\n\fiv \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \nRisks and \nAssumptions \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\nthe  proposed  TZR.  Poverty \n\nwhich 20 are rural and 2 urban. Eleven counties are designated national \nor  provincial  poverty  counties.  The  1,527  designated  poverty  villages \nhave a population of about 1 million poor. About 70% of the beneficiaries \nlive  in  rural  areas,  and  21.5%  are  poor  with  an  annual  net  income  per \ncapita  of  less  than  CNY900.  The  links  between  poverty,  difficult \ntopography, and poor transport systems are apparent in the project area \nfor \nis  often  caused  by  geographic \nremoteness and isolation, limited transport access, high transport costs, \nand  poor  access  to  market  information,  as  well  as  limited  access  to \nhealth, education, and other social services. \n \nThe  Project  will  facilitate  the  creation  of  additional  employment  and \nincome-generating  opportunities.  About  453,000  person-years  of  work \nwill  be created  during  construction. This  will  provide  direct employment \nopportunities to over 217,500 poor people, including women and ethnic \nminorities.  Railway  station  area  development  will  increase  incomes  in \nlocal  communities  and  help  generate  local  revenues.  The  Project  will \nfacilitate  the  development  of  small  businesses,  local  industry,  and \ntourism, which will help generate additional opportunities in the future for \nlocal  people.  Consultations  with  local  people  in  the  project  area \nindicated their strong support for the Project. \n\nThe  Project  is  financially  and  economically  sustainable.  The  8.4% \nfinancial internal rate of return exceeds the 2.2% weighted average cost \nof capital. The economic internal rate of return is estimated at 18.2%.  \n \nThe  increased  tax  revenues  generated  by  the  economic  development \ninduced by the Project will help finance improved social service facilities \nand basic infrastructure. \n \nThe railway will be constructed in mountainous and desert areas, which \nis a significant technical challenge. The associated physical risks during \nimplementation include delays, cost overruns, worker health and safety, \nand  environmental  impacts.  These  potential  risks  have  been  assessed \nand mitigating measures have been provided based on lessons learned \nfrom other railroad projects in the PRC.  \n \nResettlement will cause relocation of about 12,000 people. The railway \nalignment  was  selected  to  minimize  resettlement,  where  possible.  The \nresettlement plan includes preferential treatment for employment during \nconstruction,  supply  of  local  materials,  allocation  of  commercial  space \nnear railway stations, and job training. Resettlement will be implemented \nby  local  governments  and  closely  monitored  and  supervised.  These \nmeasures  will  mitigate  the  potential  social  risks  associated  with \nresettlement. \n \nIntermodal  competition  between  railways  and  roads  will  create  market \nrisks  for  the  project  railway.  However,  the  existing  road  is  already \ncongested and the capacity constraint is expected to worsen. Surveys of \npassengers  and  freight  shippers  found  that  the  railway  would  have \nseveral  advantages  over  other  transport  modes:  lower  fares,  shorter \nincreasing  commercial \ntravel \norientation of the joint venture railway will help to lessen the risks posed \nby intermodal competition. \n\ntimes,  safety,  and  punctuality.

The \ndesign and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nA. \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis  \n\nFrom 1978, when market-oriented economic reforms were introduced, through to 2005, \n2. \nthe  PRC  has  experienced  sustained  rapid  economic  growth,  which  has  resulted  in  an \naccordingly  rapid  increase  in  demand  for  transportation.  The  annual  growth  of  passenger \ntransport  was  9%  and  freight  transport  grew  at  7.6%  during  the  1978\u20132004  period.  In  2005, \nroad  traffic  accounted  for  53.2%  of  total  passenger-kilometers  (km),  followed  by  railways  with \n34.7%, civil aviation with 11.7%, and coastal and inland waterways with 0.4%. The modal split \nfor  freight  ton-km  was  61.3%  for  coastal  and  inland  waterways,  26.5%  for  railways,  11.0%  for \nroads, 1.1% for pipelines, and 0.1% for civil aviation.  \n \n3. \nThe railway is the primary mode of transport for long distance and bulk transport. At the \nend  of  2005,  the  PRC\u2019s  railway  system  of  75,438  route-kms  comprised  62,200  km  of  national \nrailways  and  13,238  km  of  joint  venture  and  local  railways.  The  Ministry  of  Railways  (MOR) \noperates the state-owned national railway as an integrated system. The joint venture and local \nrailways,  comprising  regional  lines  within  provincial  boundaries,  are  constructed  under  the \nsponsorship  of  provincial  governments  and/or  MOR  to  serve  local  needs  and  provide \ninterconnection to the national railway network. Despite its large size, the railway network does \nnot provide adequate coverage for the country\u2019s population and land area.1  \n \n4. \nPRC railways have the highest freight transport density in the world and second highest \npassenger  transport  density  after  Japan.  Locomotive  turnover  is  the  highest  in  the  world. \nBetween 1978 and 2005, railway freight increased from 535 billion ton-km to 2,073 billion ton-\nkm, equivalent to an annual growth rate of 5.1%. Passenger traffic grew at 6.6% annually from \n109 billion  passenger-km  to  606  billion  passenger-km.  The  average  railway  journey  increased \nfrom 134 km in 1978 to 527 km in 2005, compared with the average journey per passenger by \nroad, which grew from 35 km to 54 km over the same period. Despite such growth rates, railway \ncapacity  has  lagged  behind  demand  because  of  system  constraints.  Given  the  railways\u2019 \nimportant  role  in  providing  economic  transportation,  these  constraints,  if  not  removed,  will \ncontinue  to  be  among  the  major  constraints  to  efficient  economic  growth.  The  Government\u2019s \naggressive  plan  to  improve  railways  includes  network  expansion  and  construction  in \nunderserved areas. \n \nB. \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\n \n\n1. \n\nGovernment Strategy  \n\n5. \nThe  Government's  policy  on  railway  development  focuses  on  (i)  removing  constraints \nand  expanding  the  system,  (ii)  encouraging  the  construction  of  joint  venture  local  railways  to \npromote  the  development  of  local  economies,  (iii)  improving  the  efficiency  and  safety  of  the \nexisting  system  by  using  new  technology  and  modern  management  tools  in  planning  and \noperation,  (iv)  reducing  operating  subsidies  through  appropriate  pricing  and  commercialization \nof  services,  (v)  initiating  institutional  and  structural  reforms  to  increase  autonomy  and \naccountability,  and  (vi)  encouraging  nongovernment  investment  in  infrastructure  and  related \nservices.  \n\n                                                 \n1 The network density per 1,000 square km of land is one third that of India and one tenth that of Japan. \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\n \n6. \nThe  Tenth  Five-Year  Plan  (2001\u20132005)  identified  transportation,  including  railway \ndevelopment, as a priority. The plan envisaged (i) constructing 6,000 km of new lines to provide \naccess  to  unserved  areas,  with  the  network  length  reaching  a  total  of  75,000  route-km; \n(ii) providing  3,000  km  of  double  lines  and  electrifying  5,000  km  of  key  lines  to  increase \ncapacity; and (iii) increasing operating speeds on 5,000 km, with the total length of such lines \nreaching  15,000  km.  A  total  investment  of  CNY350  billion  was  planned,  including  CNY270 \nbillion  for  capital  construction  and  CNY80  billion  for  rolling  stock.  By  the  end  of  2005,  a  total \ninvestment  of  CNY308  billion  for  capital  construction  was  made  for  constructing  6,458  km  of \nnew lines, providing 3,275 km of double lines and electrifying 6,259 km of tracks. During 2003\u2013\n2007,  the  investments  for  capital  construction  are  expected  to  reach  CNY450  billion.  The  11th \nFive  Year  Plan  (2006\u20132010),  which  is  under  preparation,  continues  to  emphasize  railway \ndevelopment (Appendix 3). \n \n7. \nIn  2004,  the  State  Council  approved  the  railway  development  plan,  which  (i)  seeks  to \nexpand the railway network to 85,000 km by 2010 and 100,000 km by 2020; and (ii) identifies \nthe  need  for  separate  passenger-  and  freight-dedicated  lines  on  busy  trunk  routes.  The  route \nnetwork length of the passenger-dedicated network will reach 5,000 km by 2010 and 12,000 km \nby  2020.  Increasing train  speed  to enhance  mobility  is  a major  goal: by  2020,  train  speed  will \nincrease  to  over  200  km  per  hour  on  the  trunk  network  from  the  present  120  km  per  hour. \nPriority will be given to developing railways in unserved areas, and regions that lack transport \nand remain less developed. The route network length will increase by 16,000 km in the western \nregion of the PRC to reach a network length of 40,000 km by 2020. \n \n\n2. \n\nAsian Development Bank Strategy and Sector Experience \n\n8. \nThe Asian Development Bank (ADB) strategy for the railway sector focuses on helping \n(i)  expand  the  railway  system  by  constructing  new  lines  in  unserved,  less-developed  areas; \n(ii) modernize and increase capacity to improve efficiency on key routes of the national railway \nsystem;  (iii)  commercialize  railway  operations  to  sustain  efficient  operations;  and  (iv)  increase \nrailway  competitiveness  in  the  transport  sector  through  restructuring  and  reform.  ADB  has \nfocused  on  the  development  of  railways  in  poor,  less-developed  inland  provinces  to  promote \nsustainable  economic  growth  and  reduce  poverty.2 ADB  has  provided  13  loans  totaling  about \n$2.6 billion to finance the construction of about 1,921 km of eight provincial railways operated by \njoint  ventures  with  MOR,  and  4,597  km  of  new  railway  lines  under  the  five  national  railway \nprojects (Appendix 4). The Project, designed to promote economic growth by providing railway \ntransportation  in  unserved,  less-developed,  and  poor  areas  of  Shanxi,  Shaanxi,  and  Ningxia \nprovinces, is consistent with the PRC\u2019s development priorities and the ADB strategy. \n \n\n3. \n\nPolicy Dialogue  \n\n9. \nPolicy  dialogue  has  been  a  feature  of  ADB  assistance  to  the  railway  sector  and  has \neffectively  complemented  the  lending  operations.  Since  1989,  11  technical  assistance  (TA) \ninitiatives totaling $5.0 million have been provided for institutional development of local railways, \ntariff  and  organizational  studies  for  the  Jing\u2013Jiu  railway,  enhancement  of  commercial  and \nbusiness operations, marketing and business development, human resource development, and \nimprovement  of  financial  management  and  accounting  systems  (Appendix  4).  ADB  policy \ndialogue  with  MOR  focuses  on  (i)  poverty  reduction  as  the  overarching  objective  of  ADB \noperations,  (ii)  full  compliance  with  ADB  safeguard  policies,  (iii)  sector  reforms,  (iv)  marketing \nand business development, (v) private sector participation and nongovernmental financing, and \n\n                                                 \n2  ADB.  2000.  Technical  Assistance  for  Assessing  the  Impact  of  Transport  and  Energy  Infrastructure  on  Poverty \nReduction.  Manila.  The  findings  conclude  that  completed  railway  projects  supported  general  economic  growth  in \nthe region and led to small areas of high economic growth in towns served by railway stations. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n3 \n\n(vi)  regional  cooperation.  The  railway  development  plan  defines  the  major  goals  for  the  PRC \nrailways  to  2020,  and  is  in  broad  agreement  with  ADB\u2019s  strategic  agenda.  MOR\u2019s  proposed \nreform  agenda  for  this  plan  seeks  to  (i)  study  and  learn  from  the  best  international  practices \ngained  worldwide,  (ii)  separate  core  operations  from  noncore  transportation  businesses, \n(iii) rationalize  and  reduce  staff,  (iv)  reform  the  railway  investment  and  financing  system,  and \n(v) establish specialized transportation companies.  \n\n \n\n10.  MOR  has  adopted  a  structured  approach  to  railway  reform.  In  1999,  using  a  new \nmanagement  concept\u2014the  asset  operating  liability  system\u2014MOR  entered  into  management \ncontracts with railway administrations to improve profitability (as a pilot project). The contracts \nhelped  improve  operational  and  financial  performance;  this  approach  was  subsequently \nextended to all 15 railway administrations. Separation of core and noncore businesses is a key \nelement  of  MOR\u2019s  restructuring  program.  The  total  number  of  employees  in  the  core \ntransportation  business  was  reduced  from  1.89  million  in  1997  to  1.41  million  in  2005.  In  the \nnoncore  transportation  business,  five  large  companies  employing  616,500  staff  have  been \ndivested.  To  provide  jobs  for  redundant  staff,  by  the  end  of  2005  MOR  had  set  up  5,076 \ndiversified  businesses  (independent  of  the  core  transportation  business)  employing  more  than \n370,000 staff to supply equipment, goods, and services to the railway industry. In 1998, MOR \ninitiated  a  cost-sharing  scheme  for  health  insurance  and  pensions  for  railway  employees.  In \n2005, MOR completed the transfer of 822 primary and  middle schools, 46 vocational schools, \nand  181  nursery  schools;  and  260  hospitals  and  medical  units  to  local  governments.  One \nhundred branch lines comprising 7,800 km were separated to improve productivity and reduce \noperating  losses.  (The  reform  agenda  matrix  is  in  Appendix  5.  Supplementary  Appendix  A \nincludes a chronology of railway reforms.) \n \n\na. \n\nPoverty Reduction \n\n11. \nThe  strategic  purpose  of  ADB  involvement  in  the  railway  sector  is  to  create  the \nconditions  for  sustainable  economic  growth  to  help  improve  living  standards.  The  Project, \nlocated  in  an  unserved  area,  has  the  potential  for  economic  growth  once  improved,  cost-\neffective transport access is provided. Identifying ways to enhance the poverty reduction impact \nhas been an integral part of project planning and design. Specific features include (i) providing \nemployment  during  construction  and  operation  of  the  TZR  on  a  preferential  basis  to  poor \nworkers, including women;3 (ii) utilizing locally produced materials that meet the requirements of \nquality and economy (e.g., sand, stone, cement); (iii) adding provisions for railway station area \ndevelopment;  (iv)  providing  station  access  roads  and  construction  access  roads;  and \n(v) supporting  poverty  reduction  programs  of  local  governments. 4  The  Project  will  finance \nconstruction  access  roads  to  be  handed  over  to  the  local  government  at  the  end  of  the \nconstruction. Local governments have a 5-year plan to improve the road network and transport \nservices  in  the  project  area  concurrently  with  the  Project.  These  roads  will  reach  all  of  the \nprovince-designated poverty villages. The Project and the local road development will increase \nthe welfare gains for the poor, including women, and help spread project benefits to the poverty \nvillages. \n \n\n                                                 \n3  In the Guizhou\u2013Shuibai Railway Project, the proportion of the poor in unskilled labor was 41% on average and 64% \nduring peak construction.

Manila.  \n\n4  Some completed projects reported that about 40% of the poor at appraisal were raised above the poverty line upon \nproject  completion  e.g.  in  the  case  of  the  Hefei\u2013Jiujiang  Railway  Project  41%  of  the  poor  were  raised  above  the \npoverty  line.

Manila. \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\nb. \n\nSector Reforms \n\n12. \nADB is supporting institutional reform of the railway sector to separate government and \nenterprise functions, giving full play to market forces and increasing the competitiveness of the \nrailways.  ADB  has  actively  pursued  (i)  separation  of  the  core  transport  business  from  the \nnoncore  transport  business,  (ii)  segmentation  of  passenger  and  freight  services,  and \n(iii) strengthening of the recently corporatized  specialized transportation companies. As part of \nADB\u2019s  policy  dialogue  with  MOR,  three  large  companies  handling  containers,  special  goods, \nand  express  parcel  have  been  set  up. 5  Setting  up  passenger-dedicated  corridors  with  a \nseparate  institutional  structure  is  a  key  ADB  intervention.6 ADB  is  assisting  in  developing  the \ninstitutional, marketing, business development, and technical standards for such initiatives.  \n \n13. \nRationalization  of  staff  and  reduction  of  transportation  and  non-transportation  staff  is \nalso being pursued. On 18 March 2005, under a major restructuring exercise, MOR abolished \n41  subrailway  administration  bureaus,  thereby  reducing  one  tier  of  railway  management.  The \nnumber  of  stations  and  sections  were  reduced  from  1,500  to  894,  and  the  number  of  railway \nadministrations  increased  from  15  to  18.  This  has  helped  reduce  20,000  staff,  rationalize \noperations,  improve  productivity,  and  enhance  efficiency.  Recent  ADB  interventions  have \nsupported  operational  reforms  and  emphasized  railway  safety\u2014including  the  introduction  of \nsafe  and  reliable  technology,  upgrading  speeds,  introducing  dedicated  passenger  and  freight \nlines, modern dispatch control system, and high quality information systems on the PRC railway \nnetwork.  The  PRC\u2019s  accession  to  the  World  Trade  Organization  has  intensified  competition \namong different modes of transport and the structure of transport demand is likely to change.7 \nADB  is  providing  an  advisory  TA  for  policy  reform  support  to  MOR,8 which  will  look  at  the \nconflicting roles of meeting social obligations and making profits, increasing modal competition, \nimpacts  caused  by  the  fast  pace  of urbanization  and  economic  development,  and  demand  for \ndelivery of improved services. During project processing, coordination was maintained with the \nWorld  Bank  and  a  common  approach  to  reforms  and  assistance  was  developed.  This  will  be \ncontinued during project implementation. \n \n\nc. \n\nMarketing and Business Development  \n\n14. \nAs the PRC progresses to a market-driven economy, railways will need to compete on \nthe basis of price and service quality for demand-based transportation services. New marketing \nand  business  development  initiatives  are  needed  for  freight  and  passenger  services  to  be \ncompetitive.  In  past  projects,  ADB  has  supported  project-specific  studies  to  create  marketing \nand  business  development  opportunities,  including  skills  and  knowledge  for  market-oriented \noperation  and  awareness  of  profitable  operations.  The  Project  will  continue  these  initiatives \nthrough a capacity development program for the Project Company. \n \n\n                                                 \n5  These companies are China Railway Container Transport Company, China Railway Express Parcel Company, and \nChina  Railway  Special  Goods  Company.  The  startup  process  is  ongoing.  ADB  and  MOR  have  agreed  on  the \nseparation  of  container  businesses  as  part  of  the  ADB-financed  Yichang\u2013Wanzhou  Railway  Project.

ADB  is  assisting  MOR  with  a  study  to  examine  opportunities  for  diversified  financing \nsources, increased private sector involvement, and the possibility of public private partnerships \nin the PRC railways sector. In 2005, MOR issued guidelines on facilitating the investment and \nfinancing system reforms, which seek to reduce the threshold of the investment, encourage the \nprivate sector to invest, and welcome strategic investor in railway financing.9  Under the Project, \na  preparatory  group  has  been  established  to  look  at  the  possibility  of  diversified  financing \nsources,  including  the  private  sector.10 Three  strategic  investors11 have  expressed  interest  in \nparticipating  in  the  project  equity.  This  will  be  followed  up  during  project  implementation.  A \ncorporate  entity  will  be  set  up  to  construct,  operate,  and  manage  the  Project.  The  Project \nCompany  will  outsource  activities  such  as  consulting  services  for  construction  supervision, \ntesting,  construction  contracts,  track  maintenance,  commercial  activities,  industrial  sidings, \nloading and unloading, and other logistical facilities by open competition; and encourage private \nsector involvement in the development of station facilities, local tourism, and real estate. Extra \nlarge  container  terminals  at  Qingdao,  Lanzhou,  and  Taiyuan  will  be  established  to  facilitate \nparticipation  of  shipping  lines  and  freight  forwarders  in  the  business  of  rail  transported \ncontainers. All of these actions will enhance opportunities for private sector participation. \n \n\n4. \n\nLessons  \n\n16. \nExperience  from  completed  and  ongoing  ADB-financed  railway  projects  in  the  PRC \nshows  strong  commitment  and  generally  satisfactory  capabilities  of  executing  agencies  for \nproject  implementation  (Appendix  6).  The  speed  of  implementation  has  generally  exceeded \nexpectations  at  appraisal,  and  agencies  have  generally  complied  with  loan  covenants. \nResettlement  and  environmental  management  were  carried  out  satisfactorily.  Audit  covenants \nwere  complied  with  in  a  timely  manner,  and  the  audited  financial  statements  were  generally \nacceptable. Of the 13 ADB-supported railway projects, 8 have been completed,12 2 have started \ncommercial operations,13 and 3 are under implementation.14 \n                                                 \n9  China National Oil Petroleum Company is financing CNY1.7 billion for Beijing\u2013Tianjin intercity railway line, whose \n\nconstruction started in July 2005. \n\nExchange. \n\n10 Guangzhou\u2013Shenzhen joint venture railway company is listed on Hong Kong Stock Exchange and New York Stock \n\n11 China  Communication  Construction  Engineering  Group,  Beijing;  China  Engineering  Construction  Group,  Beijing; \n\nand Shaanxi Province Hualong Energy Limited Liability Company, Xi\u2019an. \n\n12  ADB.  1989.

The  main  impacts  are  as  follows:  (i)  new  railway  lines  in  less-\ndeveloped regions stimulated economic development, resulting in higher growth rates of gross \ndomestic  product  (GDP)  and  rural  incomes  compared  with  the  \u201cwithout-project\u201d  scenario; 15 \n(ii) construction  activities  generated  demand  for  unskilled  labor  and  employment  of  poor \nworkers, \nremained  unemployed  or \nunderemployed;16 (iii)  service  roads  built  for  construction  activities  opened  up  and  benefited \nrural communities in inaccessible areas; (iv) domestic resource mobilization improved, providing \nadditional  resources  for  social  programs 17  and  generating  employment;  (v)  supply  and \ntransportation of local materials generated employment; (vi) improved and lower cost transport \nresulted  in  lower  prices  of  agricultural  inputs  (such  as  fertilizers),  which  stimulated  cash-crop \nfarming  and  provided  more  income  to  farmers;  increased  the  mobility  of  rural  residents;  and \nallowed  access  to  more  markets,  employment  opportunities,  and  social  services  beyond  the \nimmediate communities; (vii) counties provided with new railway access recorded higher GDP \ngrowth rates than other counties; (viii) the investment environment was enhanced, resulting in \nrapid  development  of  secondary  and  tertiary  industries  that  generated  employment;18 (ix)  the \nconsequent  shift  in  the  structure  of  employment  from  low  productivity  agriculture  to  higher \nproductivity  agroprocessing  and  light  industry  increased  employment  opportunities  for  women \nwhose  incomes  and  social  status  then  improved; 19 (x)  tourism  developed  because  of  more \naffordable  and  convenient  railway  travel;  and  (xi)  environmental  protection  and  mitigation \nmeasures were taken under the projects as agreed at appraisal, and the environmental impacts \n____________________________________________________________________________ \nProposed Loan to the People\u2019s Republic of China for the Ganzhou\u2013Longyan Railway Project.

Report and Recommendation of the President to \nthe  Board  of  Directors  on  a  Proposed  Loan  to  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  for  the  Zhengzhou-Xi\u2019an  Railway \nProject. Manila (Loan 2182-PRC for $400 million, approved on 22 September). \n\n15  In the project area of the Jing\u2013Jiu Railway (footnote 11), the GDP of 10 counties in Jiangxi province increased from \nCNY4.9  billion  in  1993  to  CNY15.4  billion  in  1998,  an  annual  increase  of  25.5%  compared  with  10.2%  for  the \nprovince as a whole. Rural income per capita in Xinfeng county increased from CNY802 in 1993 to CNY2,222 in \n1998, an annual increase of 18.5% compared with 10.3% during 1985\u20131992 (before the Project). \n\n16  During the first 2 years of construction of the Guizhou\u2013Shuibai Railway (footnote 10), a total of about 7.5 million \nperson-days of employment was generated, of which 4.1 million person-days or about 55% were provided to local \npoor people thereby raising them above the poverty line. \n\n17  The  financial  revenue  of  10  poverty  counties  in  Jiangxi  province  that  are  traversed  by  the  Jing\u2013Jiu  Railway \n(footnote  11)  increased  from  CNY0.5  billion  in  1993  to  CNY1.4  billion  in  1998,  an  annual  increase  of  22.7% \ncompared with 12.3% during 1985\u20131992, before construction of the Jing\u2013Jiu Railway. \n\n18  The Jing\u2013Jiu Railway facilitated setting up many resource- and agriculture-based industries in Xingfeng county of \nJiangxi  province\u2014from  3  in  1992  to  39  in  1998,  after  project  completion.  The  number  of  businesses  grew  from \n8,005 in 1992 to 19,287 in 1998, and the number of persons employed in these businesses increased from 18,484 \nin 1992 to 52,153 in 1998\u2014an annual increase of 23%. In the same county, the number of people living below the \npoverty line was reduced from 30,400 in 1993 to 11,580 in 1998, a decline of 62%. \n\n19 Beneficial  income  and  social  impacts,  particularly  on  women,  were  noted  in  the  influence  areas  of  the  Yaogu\u2013\n\nMaoming Railway (footnote 11) and Guang\u2013Mei-Shan Railway (footnote 11). \n\n \n\n\f \n\n7 \n\nof  induced  developments  were  addressed  in  accordance  with  the  environmental  impact \nassessments (EIAs) for the projects. The railway projects have contributed to a transformation \nof  the  local  economies:  per  capita  rural  incomes  increased  substantially,  living  standards \nimproved, and poverty reduced. The lessons learned and experience gained are incorporated in \nthe current project design.  \n \n\n5. \n\nRationale \n\n19. \nThe  project  rationale  reflects  (i)  network  development;  (ii)  capacity  enhancement; \n(iii) support  for  the  PRC  railway  development  plan  and  the  western  region  development \nstrategy;  and  (iv)  promotion  of  pro-poor  economic  growth  along  the  railway  line  and  in  the \nregion,  thereby  reducing  poverty.  The  project  area  is  largely  mountainous  and  desert  with \nabundant  natural  reserves  of  coal,  and  other  nonferrous  materials;  and  a  large  manufacturing \nindustry  and  tourist  sites.  In  spite  of  abundant  natural  resources,  many  are  poor  and  the \neconomic growth necessary to reduce rural poverty has failed to develop because of inadequate \ntransport services and high costs. Local governments and people living in the project area see \nthe railway as a key investment for addressing this problem. \n \n20. \nThere is no east\u2013west railway line linking Shanxi, Shaanxi, and Ningxia provinces. The \nproposed  project  is  the  shortest  east\u2013west  corridor  linking  Beijing,  Qingdao,  Hunaghua, \nQinhuangdao,  Taiyuan,  and  other  major  cities  and  ports  in  the  east  to  Yinchuan,  Zhongwei, \nLanzhou,  and  Urumqui  in  the  west  on  its  way  to  Kazakhstan.  The  proposed  alignment  for  the \nTZR  is  100\u2013500  km  shorter  than  the  existing  route  passing  through  the  Longhai  and  Baolan \nrailway lines. Traversing Shanxi and Shaanxi Provinces, and Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region \n(NHAR),  the  proposed  railway  line  will  connect  with  Beijing\u2013Guangzhou\u2013Shenzhen,  Qingdao\u2013\nShijiazhuang\u2013Taiyuan,  Taiyuan\u2013Zhengzhou,  Huanghua\u2013Shijiazhuang\u2013Taiyuan,  Qinhuangdao\u2013\nTianjin\u2013Cangzhou\u2013Shijiazhuang\u2013Taiyuan  main  lines  in  the  east;  Shenmu\u2013Yan\u2019an 20  in  the \ncenter;  and  Baotou\u2013Wuhai\u2013Lanzhou,  Baotou\u2013Suide\u2013Xi\u2019an,  Urumqui\u2013Wuwei\u2013Zhongwei,  and \nXi\u2019an\u2013Yan\u2019an  main  lines  in  the  west.  The  proposed  line  extends  eastward  to  Shijizhuang, \nconnecting  with  Jing\u2013Guang,  to  Hengshui,  connecting  with  Jing\u2013Jiu, 21  and  to  Dezhou \nconnecting with the Jing\u2013Hu route; westward to Wuwei and Lanzhou, connecting with the Jing\u2013\nLan routes and Lan\u2013Xin line; northward to Wuhai, connecting with Baotou on Jing\u2013Bao line; and \nsouthward to Baoji and Xi\u2019an, connecting with Longhai line. The Project will also help promote \nregional cooperation as this is the shortest east\u2013west corridor linking the PRC to Europe. \n \n21. \nThe  Project  and  associated  developments  are  expected  to  stimulate  industrial  and \nnatural resources development, tourism and related industries, increase the mobility and flow of \ninformation  exchanges,  generate  employment,  increase  living  standards,  and  help  reduce \npoverty.  The  Project  is  part  of  the  Government's  program  to  integrate  the  development  of \ntransportation  facilities,  upgrade  highways,  and  construct  links  and  access  roads  to  the \nhinterland. Other infrastructure, such as water supply and investment to improve education and \nhealth care facilities, are also planned. The railway will play an important role in facilitating and \nintegrating this poor and underdeveloped region in the PRC and neighboring countries.  \n \n22. \nThe Project will be a joint venture railway owned and operated by MOR and the Shanxi, \nShaanxi,  and  Ningxia  provincial  governments.  Joint  venture  railways,  which  account  for \n8,500 km  (2004)  of  the  PRC  system,  have  substantial  managerial  and  financial  autonomy, \nincluding  the  freedom  to  set  tariffs,  which  are  several  times  higher  than  those  of  the  national \nnetwork.  Freight  and  passenger  traffic  on  joint  venture  railways  has  grown  faster  than  on \nnational railways. Between 1996 and 2005, passenger traffic grew from 2.2 billon passenger-km \n\n                                                 \n20  ADB provided $200 million for Loan 1553-PRC: Shenmu\u2013Yan\u2019an Railway Project (footnote 11). \n21  ADB provided $200 million for Loan 1305-PRC: Jing\u2013Jiu Railway Technical Enhancement Project (footnote 11). \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nto 22.5 billion (29.5%), and freight rose from 12.3 billion ton-km to 109.3 billion ton-km (27.5%) \nannually, compared with an annual growth rate of 6.8% for passengers and 4.9% for freight on \nthe  national  railway  network.  Joint  venture  railways  are  more  efficient,  employing  only  8\u201310 \npeople  per  km  compared  with  about  25  people  per  km  for  national  railways.  The  Project \nCompany will employ 8\u201310 people per km. \n \n23. \nThe Project is a key intervention in the railway sector with many technical, operational, \nsafety, economic, and financial benefits. MOR has agreed that a corporate entity will be set up \nto construct, operate, and manage the Project; and that it will help enhance the financial viability \nand  private  sector  participation.  ADB  is  assisting  in  the  institutional,  marketing,  and  business \ndevelopment for the Project Company. The tariffs agreed are affordable and financially viable. \nThe  Project  will  bring  in  new  technology  and  pursue  operational  reforms,  including  the \nintroduction  of  safe  and  reliable  technology,  increase  of  speeds,  and  introduction  of  modern \ndispatch  control  systems  and  high  quality  information  systems  on  the  railway  network.  When \ncomplete,  the  Project  will  provide  a  shorter  link  to  the  west,  release  capacity  on  the  existing \nrailway  lines,  and  provide  for  an  efficient,  high-quality,  safe,  reliable,  and  environmentally \nfriendly mode of transport in the region.  \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n24. \nBy removing a transport constraint to sustainable economic growth, the Project will help \nincrease  standards  of  living  and  reduce  poverty  in  the  project  area.  This  will  be  achieved  by \nproviding efficient, affordable railway transportation in unserved, less developed areas to create \nthe  conditions  necessary  for  developing  local  resources  and  generating  employment  and \nincome-enhancing opportunities. \n \nB. \n\nOutputs \n\nThe Project comprises (i) construction of 520 km double track electrified standard gauge \n25. \nClass  I  railway  from  Taiyuan  to  Dingbian,  232  km  electrified  single  track  from  Dingbian-\nZhongwei,  and  192  km  electrified  single  track  from  Dingbian  to  Yinchuan;22 (ii)  construction  of \n41  new  railway  stations  complete  with  facilities;  (iii)  safety  initiatives,  including  provision  of \nmodern  technology  and  equipment  for  enhancing  safety;  (iv)  signaling,  e-governance  and \nmanagement  information  system;  (v)  provision  of  training  on  the  use  and  maintenance  of \nmodern  equipment;  (vi)  land  acquisition  and  resettlement;  (vii)  environmental  protection  and \nmitigation  of  adverse  environmental  effects;  (viii)  consulting  services \nfor  construction \nsupervision,  monitoring  and  evaluation,  and  marketing  and  business  development;  and  (ix) \nstrengthening  of  institutional  capabilities.  The  key  inputs  needed  for  project  implementation \ninclude civil works, equipment, consultants, and MOR and Project Company staff.  \n \nC. \n\nSpecial Features \n\n26. \nEnergy  and  Pollution  Benefits.  Railways  as  a  mode  of  transport  are  more  energy-\nefficient and environmentally friendly than road transport. Rolling resistance of a steel wheel on \na rail is much less than that of rubber tires on a pavement; some theoretical estimates indicate \nthat  rail  transport  is  between  6  and  10  times  more  energy  efficient  than  road.  In  the  United \nStates,  the  Department  of  Energy  has  estimated 23  the  energy  intensity  of  rail  freight  at \n345 British Thermal Units (BTUs) per ton-mile and road freight at 3,476 BTUs per ton-mile. This \nindicates that rail is about 10 times as energy efficient as truck transport\u2014a range similar to the \n\n                                                 \n22 Supplementary Appendix B describes the characteristics of the TZR. \n23  US Department of Energy. 2004.Transport Energy Data Book, Edition 24. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n9 \n\nestimate made by Canadian researchers.24 Based on the International Energy Agency report25 \nand  fuel  data  from  China  Statistical  Yearbook  200526,  the  diverted  traffic  from  road  to  rail  will \nlead to a saving of 1.16 million ton oil equivalent (mtoe) in 2012 and 1.85 mtoe in 2020, which \nwill  result  in  a  benefit  (on  account  of  reduced  fuel  consumption)  of  CNY273.8  million  in  2012. \nThere is a direct relationship between energy consumption and emission of harmful pollutants, \nand  rail  transport  emits  far  fewer  harmful  elements  compared  with  road.  These  emissions \ninclude  carbon  dioxide  (CO2),  nitrogen  oxides,  hydrocarbons,  sulfur  oxides,  and  suspended \nparticles. Under the provisions of the Kyoto Protocol, a value can be placed on CO2 emissions; \ncertified  emission  reductions  of  CO2  are  presently  valued  in  the  PRC  at  $8  per  ton.27 Using \nspecific  fuel  usage  and  emission  rates  for  the  PRC,  the  diverted  traffic  from  road  to  rail  will \nresult in reduced CO2 emissions by 34,000 tons in 2012, rising to 56,000 tons in 2020; this will \nresult in an annual benefit of CNY 2.2 million in 2012, increasing to CNY 3.60 million in 2020.    \n \n27. \nSubregional  Context.  The  proposed  railway  is  the  shortest  east\u2013west  railway  link \nproviding  land  access  to  Europe  through  Kazakhstan.  The  Project  will  promote  railway  and \nmultimodal transport of goods and people in the region and thus support regional cooperation. \nMOR  has  agreed  to  construct  three  extra-large  container  terminals  at  Qingdao,  Lanzhou, \nTaiyuan,  and  container  handling  facilities  at  Yinchuan  (i)  attract  high-value  traffic  on  the \nrailways;  (ii)  promote  intermodal  traffic;  and  (iii)  encourage  private  sector  shippers  and  freight \nforwarders to use the facility for export and import of cargo to other parts of the PRC, ports in \nthe  east,  and  Central  Asia  and  Europe  in  the  west.  These  will  be  financed  by  MOR  and \ncompleted by 2010. \n \nSafety.  ADB  policy  dialogue  has  emphasized  the  need  for  operational  reforms  for  the \n28. \nrail  network, \nintroducing  safe  and  reliable  technology; \nmodernizing  maintenance  systems;  and  monitoring  safety  performance.  A  project  component \n($13.4  million  equivalent,  of  which  $2.6  million  will  be  financed  by  the  ADB  loan)  will  promote \nand  enhance  railway  safety.  It  will  finance  the  procurement  of  operation  and  maintenance \nequipment to enhance safety and build capacity, including staff training. \n \n29. \nSignaling,  E-Governance  and  Management  Information  System.  Part  of  ADB\u2019s \npolicy  dialogue  emphasized  introducing  modern  management  systems  and  high-quality \ninformation  systems  for  the  PRC  railway  network.  A  project  component  ($52.3  million \nequivalent,  of  which  $30.0  million  will  be  financed  by  the  ADB  loan)  will  introduce  a  modern \noperating  dispatch  information  system,  linking  the  project  train  and  national  train  reservation \nsystems, and introducing a simulation system to monitor and analyze train performance.  \n \nTourism.  Shanxi,  Shaanxi,  and  Ningxia  are  important  tourist  destinations  and  the \n30. \nProject  will  support  tourism  development.  Local  government  support  to  the  communities, \nincluding  the  poor,  to  promote  tourism  business  has  been  successful,  including  village  home \nstays  and  handicrafts.  The  provincial  and  the  local  governments  agreed  to  increase  such \nsupport by reallocating some of the increased tax revenue from the Project.    \n \n31. \nOpportunities  for Private  Sector.  The Project Company will outsource activities such \nas  consulting  services  for  construction  supervision,  testing,  construction  contracts,  track \nmaintenance,  and  industrial  sidings  by  open  competition.  The  Project  will  encourage  private \nsector  initiatives  such  as  onboard  train  services,  including  catering,  cleaning,  and  loading  and \nunloading  at  railway  stations.  Station  space  will  be  developed  and  rented  out  by  open \n                                                 \n24  The  Railway  Association  of  Canada.  2001.

ADB has engaged MOR in dialogue aimed at enhancing policy reform during \nthe project processing and this will be continued. Under the Project, significant steps are equity \nparticipation by the three provinces and setting up a corporate entity to construct, operate, and \nmanage  the  Project.  ADB  fact-finding  Mission  also  explored  the  possibility  of  diversified \nfinancing sources, including strategic investors and the private sector. China Development Bank \nand China Construction Bank have already committed financing. Three strategic investors have \nexpressed  interest  in  participating  in  the  project  equity. 28 This  will  be  followed  up.  Specific \nmeasures are proposed under the Project to outsource some of the activities to date handled by \nrailways,  and  involve  the  private  sector.  At  the  national  level,  abolishing  one  tier  of  railway \nmanagement is a major step. MOR will continue the process of separating the core and noncore \nactivities and rationalization of staff. The Project will bring in new technology, emphasize safety, \nand build capacity for MOR and the joint venture railways.  \n \n33. \nSocial  Development  Plan. The Project will facilitate economic development, which will \nbenefit  the  largely  poor  population,  particularly  women  and  the  vulnerable.  The  social \ndevelopment  action  plan  (SDAP)  will  (i)  enhance  project  benefits;  (ii)  ensure  adverse  impacts \nare  avoided  or  mitigated;  and  (iii)  ensure  economic  development  benefits  the  poor,  women, \nethnic minorities, and the vulnerable in an equitable and sustainable manner. \n \n34. \nStakeholder  Consultation  and  Participation.  Extensive  consultations\u2014including \nsurveys\u2014involved  about  15,450  people,  such  as  local  villagers,  tourists,  businesspersons, \ntransport  users,  and  local  governments  (Appendix  7).  This  helped  to  (i) understand  public \nopinion  about  the  proposed  railway;  (ii) conduct  the  environmental,  economic,  and  social \nassessments;  (iii) plan  resettlement;  and  (iv)  identify  the  role  of  various  stakeholders.  Leading \ngroups  have  been  formed  in  the  prefectures  with  participation  from  relevant  government \nagencies,  including  poverty  reduction  offices;  All-China  Women\u2019s  Federation;  and  health,  civil \naffairs, and ethnic affairs bureaus. The local governments assured that the consultation process \nwill be continued to finalize the design and formulate appropriate land compensation, relocation, \nand rehabilitation measures. \n \nSmall Business Development Opportunities. The Project includes 41 railway stations, \n35. \nwhich  will  be  connected  to  villages,  townships,  and  counties  by  roads  and  other  transport \nnetworks. These stations and the station access roads, construction of access roads, and link \nroads  will  help  develop  small  businesses  and  commercial  activities,  including  setting  up  small \nshops,  kiosks,  local  handicraft  shops,  and  areas  where  local  people  can  sell  local  fruits  and \nagro-products. The local governments assured that the railway stations and surrounding areas \nwill  be  developed  with  local  communities  to  promote  local  businesses,  income-generating \nactivities,  and  other  opportunities  that  can  benefit  all  communities,  especially  the  remote  poor \nand  women;  and  agreed  to  provide  entrepreneurial  training and  start-up  capital  (microfinance) \nfor small businesses to local people.   \n \n36. \nEmployment Opportunities for Local People. About 453,000 person-years of work will \nbe created for unskilled laborers during construction, of which 50% or more will be targeted at \npoor,  resettlement-affected  people,  women,  ethnic  minorities,  and  other  vulnerable  people \ntotaling 217,500 person-years with total wages of CNY1,631 million. The use of locally produced \nmaterials  for  railway  construction  will  generate  an  additional  83,000  person-years  of  work  for \nunskilled  laborers,  with  total  wages  of  CNY605.2  million.  When  the  new  railway  starts  full \noperation in 2012, an estimated 8,954 jobs will be created with total wages of CNY107.4 million \n\n                                                 \n28   China  Communication  Construction  Engineering  Group,  Beijing;  China  Engineering  Construction  Group,  Beijing; \n\nand Shaanxi Province Hualong Energy Limited Liability Company, Xi\u2019an. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n11 \n\nannually; that will increase to 13,922 jobs and CNY289.4 million in wages by 2030. Expecting \nmore efficient freight transport and business travels using the project railway, many enterprises \nin  the  project  area  are  planning  to  expand  their  outputs  and  increase  labor  by  an  estimated \n52,437 jobs as a result of the TZR. Freight traffic generated by the TZR will result in the creation \nof  11,500  additional  jobs  in  2012,  increasing  to  36,454  jobs  in  2030.  The  poverty  reduction \noffices  and  Women\u2019s  Federations  will  tailor  their  programs  to  ensure  sustained  gains  from \nemployment, and income-generating activities from the railway project are targeted at the poor \nand vulnerable by providing training and capacity building.  \n \n37. \nComplementary  Development  Initiatives.  To  enhance  development  impacts  in  the \nproject area, the Mission had extensive discussion with Shanxi, Shaanxi, and Ningxia provincial \nand  local  governments  to  provide  road  access,  electricity,  good  drinking  water,  and  telephone \nconnectivity to all the poverty villages along the alignment. The respective provincial and local \ngovernments  agreed  to  include  these  in  the  11th  FYP.  The  local  governments  agreed,  in \nprinciple, to provide road access to 338 villages, electricity supply to 78 villages, drinking water \nto  1,573  villages,  and  telephone  connections  to  1,197  villages  by  the  end  of  the  11th  FYP \n(2010). The mission also dialogued with local governments to reallocate part of the construction \ntax revenue (3.4% of the civil works contract value) to undertake development programs in the \nproject  area.  The  local  governments  agreed  to  reallocate  part  of  the  tax  revenue  to  relevant \nagencies to undertake development programs in the project area.  \n \nD. \n\nProject Investment Plan \n\n38. \nThe project investment cost is estimated at the equivalent of $3,752.9 million, comprising \nforeign  exchange  costs of  $1.080  billion  (28.8%)  and  local currency  costs  of  the  equivalent  of \n$2.673  billion  (71.2%).  Table  1  summarizes  the  project  investment  plan  and  details  are  in \nAppendix 8.  The  cost  estimates  are  based  on  quantities  derived  from  preliminary  engineering \ndesigns and unit rates reflecting market prices for goods and materials; and include the costs of \nland acquisition and resettlement, and environmental monitoring.  \n\n \nTable 1: Project Investment Plan \n($ million) \n\nItem \nA.

The  loan  will  have  a  26-year  term,  including  a  grace \nperiod  of  6  years,  an  interest  rate  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank \noffered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility,  a  commitment  charge  of  0.75%  per  annum, \nconversion  options  that  may  be  exercised  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  loan  regulations  and \nconversion  guidelines,  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  set  forth  in  the  Loan  Agreement. \nThe  front-end  fee  will  be  waived.  The  Government  has  provided  ADB  with  (i)  reasons  for  its \ndecision  to borrow  under  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending  facility  on  the  basis  of  these  terms  and \nconditions, and (ii) an undertaking that these choices were its own independent decision and not \nmade in reliance on any communication or advice from ADB. \n \nADB will finance 100% of the contract packages procured under the ADB loan. MOR will \n40. \nfinance the remaining foreign exchange cost. The local currency cost will be financed by MOR, \nShanxi and Shaanxi provincial governments (SPG and SAPG), NHAR, and cofinancing through \ntwo  loans  from  the  China  Development  Bank  and  China  Construction  Bank.  The  two  banks \nhave appraised the Project and provided a commitment letter to MOR. The China Development \nBank  loan  is  repayable  over  20  years,  including  a  grace  period  of  5  years,  at  a  lending  rate \ncurrently  at  5.5%  per  annum.  The  China  Construction  Bank  loan  is  repayable  over  15  years, \nincluding a grace period, at a lending rate currently at 5.5% per annum. SAPG, SPG, and NHAR \nwill  finance  the  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  costs;  this  will  be  their  equity  contribution. \nMOR, SPG, SAPG, and NHAR have made budgetary provisions for the counterpart funds. The \nallocation of loan proceeds in the Loan Agreement will be presented with reference only to total \nexpenditure, in accordance with the policy on Cost Sharing and Eligibility for Asian Development \nBank Financing: A New Approach.29 A summary of the financing plan is in Table 2 and details \nare in Appendix 8. \n\n \n\nTable 2: Financing Plan \n\n($ million) \n\nTotal  \n\nSource \nAsian Development Bank  \nMOR, SPG, SAPG, and NHAR \nChina Development Bank  \nChina Construction Bank \n    \nMOR  =  Ministry  of  Railways,  NHAR  =  Ningxia  Autonomous  Region \ngovernment, SAPG = Shaanxi provincial government, SPG = Shanxi provincial \ngovernment.  \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n300.0 \n1,314.4 \n1,606.3 \n532.2 \n3,752.9 \n\n% \n8.0 \n35.0 \n42.8 \n14.2 \n100.0 \n\nTotal \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n1. \n\nProject Management \n\n41.

The \nForeign  Capital  and  Technical  Import  Center,  under  MOR,  will  coordinate  the  project \nmanagement office's tasks and be responsible for procurement, withdrawals, and reporting vis-\n\u00e0-vis  ADB.  MOR  is  in  the  process  of  setting  up  a  project  company  (the  Project  Company),  a \nlimited liability company under the PRC Company Law, which will be the project Implementing \nAgency. The Project Company will (i) manage and operate the project railway after completion \nof  the  construction;  and  (ii)  develop  and  implement  adequate  and  transparent  business \ndevelopment  mechanisms,  and  accounting  and  reporting  systems.  A  project  leading  group \n\n                                                 \n29 ADB. 2005. Cost Sharing and Eligibility for Asian Development Bank Financing. Manila.  \n\n \nF. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n13 \n\nheaded  by  a  director  general  and  assisted  by  an  adequate  number  of  suitably  qualified \nprofessional staff has been established. It is undertaking the preparatory work of setting up the \nProject  Company  and  is  setting  up  the  on-site  construction  management  offices  along  the \nproject  route.  The  staff  is  experienced  in  railway  engineering,  financial,  and  administrative \nmatters; and implementing projects financed by international financial institutions. This leading \ngroup will be merged with the Project Company once it is established. To develop the Project \nCompany\u2019s  project  management,  business  development,  and  marketing  capacity,  further \nassistance  will  be  provided  by  the  project-financed  consulting  services.  Setting  up  the  Project \nCompany is a condition for disbursement. The financial assessment questionnaire indicates that \nthe  Project  will  have  an  adequate  financial  management  system  in  place  (details  in \nSupplementary Appendix C).  \n \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Period \n\n42. \nThe Project will be implemented over about 6 years from July 2006 to June 2012. Civil \nworks will start in December 2006 and be completed in about 4 years. Trial operations will start \nin July 2011 and last for 1 year before commercial operations begin (Appendix 9).  \n \n\n3. \n\nProcurement \n\n43. \nAll  ADB  financed  procurement  will  follow  ADB's  Procurement  Guidelines.  ADB  will \nfinance  procurement  of  materials  and  equipment  as  described  in  the  procurement  plan \n(Appendix  10).  Contracts  valued  in  excess  of  $1  million  will  be  procured  through  international \ncompetitive  bidding  (ICB).  Contracts  valued  at  less  than  $1  million  may  follow  ICB,  national \ncompetitive bidding (NCB), or limited international bidding (LIB) as determined by the particular \ncircumstances of the contract package. Below $100,000, procurement may follow the shopping \nprocedure. MOR will select tendering companies on a competitive basis to handle international \nbidding. The relevant sections of ADB's anticorruption policy30 will be included in all documents \nand contracts during bidding for, and implementation of, the Project. \n \n\n4. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n44. \nThe Government will engage and finance qualified domestic consultants for (i) detailed \nproject  design;  (ii)  preparation  of  technical  specifications;  (iii)  construction  supervision; \n(v)  environmental  supervision  and  management; \n(iv) construction  quality  assurance; \n(vi) monitoring  and  evaluation  of  the  resettlement  plan;  and  (vii)  socioeconomic  impact \nassessment, evaluation of poverty reduction, and project performance monitoring. \n \nThe  ADB  loan  will  be  used  to  finance  10  person-months  of  international  consulting \n45. \nservices to strengthen institutional, marketing, and business development functions of the Project \nCompany. Terms of reference for the international consultants\u2014to be recruited using the quality- \nand cost-based method and simplified technical proposal, in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines \non the Use  of Consultants\u2014are in Appendix 11. The provisions of ADB\u2019s anticorruption policy \nwill be included in all invitation documents and contracts for international consultants.  \n \n \n\nAnticorruption Measures \n\n5. \n\nADB's  anticorruption  policy  was  explained  to,  and  discussed  with  the  Government. \n46. \nConsistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance,  accountability  and  transparency,  ADB \nreserves  the  right  to  investigate,  directly  or  though  its  agents,  any  alleged  corrupt,  fraudulent, \ncollusive,  or  coercive  practices  relating  to  the  Project.  To  support  these  efforts,  relevant \nprovisions  of  ADB's  anticorruption  policy  are  included  in  the  loan  regulations  and  the  bidding \ndocuments  for  the  Project.  In  particular,  all  contracts  financed  by  ADB  in  connection  with  the \n\n                                                 \n30 ADB. 1998. Anticorruption Policy. Manila. \n\n \n\n\f14 \n\n \n\nProject shall include provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and examine the records and \naccounts  of  MOR,  the  Project  Company  and  all  contractors,  suppliers,  consultants,  and  other \nservice providers as they relate to the Project. \n \nIn relation to the Project, MOR will ensure that (i) a supervisory body is established for \n47. \nprevention  of  undue  interference  in  business  practices,  and  adequate  resources  are  made \navailable for its effective operation; (ii) a leading group of officials from the supervision division \nof MOR is located in offices involved in the bidding, construction, and other operational activities \nunder  the  Project;  and  (iii)  periodic  inspections  on  the  contractor\u2019s  activities  related  to  fund \nwithdrawals and settlements are carried out. MOR and the Project Company shall also initiate \nliaison  meetings  with  the  prosecutor\u2019s  office,  on  a  needs  basis,  where  warnings  about,  or \ninformation on, corrupt practices can be discussed. \n \n\n6. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements and Imprest Fund \n\nfor \n\n48. \nThe  ADB  loan  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement \nHandbook 31 and  relevant  guidelines  including  procedures  for  Libor-based  loan.  Since  most \nlarge  contracts  well  above  $100,000,  direct  payment, \npayments  will  be  made \nreimbursements,  and  commitment  procedures  will  be  used.  If  the  Government  initially  funds \neligible  expenditures,  ADB\u2019s  reimbursement  procedure  will  be \nfacilitate \ndisbursements,  MOR  requested  an  imprest  account32 after  loan  effectiveness.  Disbursements \nfrom the imprest account will be supported by an appropriate withdrawal application and related \ndocumentation.  The  ceiling  of  the  imprest  account  will  be  set  as  either  the  estimated \nexpenditures  for  the  next  6  months  or  10%  of  the  loan  amount,  whichever  is  lower.  The \nstatement  of  expenditures  procedure  will  be  used  for  liquidation  of  imprest  account  and \nreimbursement of eligible expenditures for any individual payment not exceeding $200,000.  \n \n\nfollowed.  To \n\n7. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n49. \nThe  Project  Company  will  maintain  separate  accounts  for  the  Project  and  have  such \naccounts and related financial statements audited annually by an external auditor in accordance \nwith auditing standards acceptable to ADB. The Project Company, through MOR, will submit to \nADB, within 6 months after the end of each fiscal year, certified copies of such audited project \naccounts  and  financial  statements  and  auditor's  reports,  all  in  English.  The  audit  of  such \nfinancial statements will include (i) an assessment of the adequacy of  accounting and internal \ncontrol  systems  with  respect  to  project  expenditures  and  other  financial  transactions,  (ii)  an \nassessment of compliance with loan covenants and ADB requirements for project management, \nand  (iii)  an  opinion  on  the  use  of  the  statement  of  expenditures  procedure.  The  Project \nCompany will also submit its audited financial statements covering income statements, balance \nsheets, and cash-flow statements during the first 3 years of commercial operations of the project \nrailway  within  6  months  after  the  end  of  each  fiscal  year.  To  ensure  that  the  effective  internal \ncontrol system and checks and balances mechanism are put in place, the Project Company will \nestablish  an  internal  audit  unit  within  the  company.  The  unit  will  independently  test  financial \ntransactions to ensure the safe custody of the project-financed assets and report directly to the \nProject Company's board of directors. \n\n \n\nThe Project Company will make satisfactory arrangements for reporting the progress of \n50. \nproject implementation by submitting quarterly progress reports through MOR. Within 3 months \nof completion, MOR will submit a project completion report to ADB.  \n \n\n                                                 \n31  2001. ADB. Loan Disbursement Handbook. Manila. \n32  Imprest accounts are used in three ongoing loans in the PRC. The utilization performance is satisfactory. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n15 \n\n8. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n51.  MOR  agreed  to  a  set  of  indicators  for  evaluating  project  performance  in  relation  to  its \nimpacts, outcomes, outputs, and conditions. The indicators, to be reviewed at the start of project \nimplementation,  include  (i)  economic  development  and  socioeconomic  indicators,  (ii)  transport \ncosts and time for passenger and freight services, (iii) transport services and transport charges, \n(iv) accident rates, (v) financial sustainability, (vi) county and/or village incomes, (vii) access to \nsocial  services,  and  (viii)  jobs  created  in  construction  and  maintenance.  At  the  beginning  of \nproject implementation, MOR and the Project Company will establish baseline and target values \nfor the indicators. The indicators will be measured at project inception, completion, and 3 years \nlater;  and  compared  with  the  baseline.  Where  relevant,  indicators  will  be  disaggregated  by \ngender  (Appendix  12).  MOR  will  recruit  qualified  consultants  for  monitoring  and  evaluation  to \nhelp establish the monitoring and evaluation system, and train the Project Company staff in its \nuse.  The  main  sources  of  data  include  (i)  secondary  data  from  government  sources, \n(ii) household  socioeconomic  sample  survey,  and  (iii)  participatory  rapid  appraisal.  MOR  will \nsubmit a report summarizing the key findings of monitoring at inception, completion, and 3 years \nlater to ADB. \n  \n\n9. \n\nProject Review \n\n52. \nIn  2009,  ADB,  MOR,  and  the  Project  Company  will  carry  out  a  midterm  review  of  the \nProject, covering all institutional, administrative, organizational, technical, environmental, social, \npoverty reduction, resettlement, economic, financial, and other relevant aspects that may have \nan impact on the performance of the Project and its continuing viability. The review will examine \nprogress in sector reforms, policy development, resettlement, environment, poverty impact, and \ncompliance with assurances in the Loan Agreement. \n \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\nThe  project  benefits  and  impacts  were  assessed  along  with  potential  risks  associated \n53. \nwith  the  Project.  The  combined  benefits  and  impacts  will  outweigh  the  costs,  and net  benefits \nwill accrue to the project area. \n \nA. \n\nTraffic Forecast \n\n54. \nThe  traffic  forecast  was  based  on  forecasts  prepared  by  the  Third  Survey  and  Design \nInstitute  (TSDI),  by  considering  expected  economic  growth,  population  increase,  tourism \ndevelopment  potential,  local  government  development  plans,  market  surveys,  and  the \nassessment of TA consultants. The passenger volume on the TZR is forecast to grow from 1.89 \nbillion passenger-km in 2012 to 5.93 billion passenger-km in 2031, with an average growth rate \nof 6.2%. The freight traffic on the TZR corridor is forecast to increase from about 22.22 billion \nton-km  in  2012  to  73.19  billion  ton-km  in  2031,  with  an  annual  growth  rate  of  6.5%  based  on \nsimilar  factors.  The  projected  volumes  can  be  accommodated  by  the  TZR  and  justify  project \nconstruction (Appendix 13). \n \nB. \n\nEconomic Benefits \n\nThe economic internal rate of return (EIRR) was calculated by comparing the with- and \n55. \nwithout-project situations. The TZR will reduce the cost of transport to and from the poor central \nand northwestern part of Shanxi, Shaanxi, and Ningxia provinces. Economic costs include costs \nfor  construction,  operation,  and  maintenance  costs,  and  value  of  agricultural  production  from \nland  lost  permanently.  Economic  benefits  include  (i) operating  cost  savings  for  freight  and \npassenger  traffic,  (ii)  time  saving  in  diverted  passenger  traffic  from  buses,  (iii)  generated \ntransport benefits, (iv) tourism benefits, (v) avoided road infrastructure and maintenance costs, \n(vi) shipper savings because of increased railway competition, (vii) avoided road accidents, (viii) \n\n \n\n\f16 \n\n \n\npollution  reduction  benefits,  (ix)  energy  savings,  and  (x)  national  productivity  benefits.  The \nproject  EIRR  is  18.2%,  indicating  the  Project  is  economically  viable  (Appendix 13).  Sensitivity \nanalysis  confirms  the  robustness  of  the  Project's  economic  viability.  Changes  in  the  key \nvariables,  such  as  a  20%  reduction  in  benefits,  do  not  significantly  impact  economic  viability. \nThe  capital  cost  would  have  to  increase  by  146%  over  those  estimated  for  the  EIRR  to  fall \nbelow the cutoff rate of 12%. Freight benefits would have to fall by 54% and passenger benefits \nby  2,424%.  Given  experience  in  the  PRC  railway  sector,  variations  of  such  magnitude  are \nunlikely. Project risks were quantified using the statistical method, i.e., considering the possible \nvalue for key variables and the probability with which they may occur. The result shows that the \nEIRR will exceed 12% with 98% probability. Distribution analysis, undertaken by determining the \nproject effects for various beneficiaries, indicates that a large portion of net benefits will accrue \nto project users and economy. \n \nC. \n\nFinancial Benefits  \n\n56. \nFinancial  projections  prepared  for  the  Project  Company,  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines for the Financial Governance and Management  of Investment Projects33, assessed \nthe  financial  viability  and  sustainability  of  the  railway  (Appendix 14).  The  projected  financial \nstatements indicate that financial revenues will be sufficient to cover operation and maintenance \ncosts,  income  taxes,  and  debt  service;  and  provide  a  reasonable  rate  of  return.  The  financial \nevaluation was undertaken in real terms using constant 2005 prices. The project cost estimates \nand  financial  projections  in  nominal  terms  were  converted  to  real  terms  by  adjusting  for  the \nprojected  effects  of  foreign  and  domestic  inflation  and  currency  fluctuation.  Incremental  costs \nand benefits were derived under with- and without-project scenarios. The financial internal rate \nof return, computed on an after-tax basis, is 8.4%. This compares favorably with the weighted \naverage  cost  of  capital,  also  computed  on  an  after-tax  basis,  of  2.2%.  The  Project  is  both \nfinancially viable and sustainable. Sensitivity and risk analyses indicate that the financial internal \nrate of return for the Project is robust under most conditions (Appendix 14). \n \nConsolidated financial statements for the Project Company have been prepared. Based \n57. \non  the  consultant\u2019s  estimates,  the  Project  Company\u2019s  financial  performance  is  projected  to  be \nsound and sustainable over the operating period (Appendix 14). Financial ratios were discussed \nand covenanted. \n \nD. \n\nEnvironmental Impact and Assessment \n\n58. \nThe  Project  is  classified  as  ADB  environmental  category  A.  TSDI  prepared  an \nenvironmental impact assessment (EIA) for the proposed project, which was approved by State \nEnvironmental  Protection  Administration.  MOR  endorsed  the  summary  environmental  impact \nassessment (SEIA), which was circulated to ADB\u2019s Board of Directors and uploaded on the ADB \nwebsite on 15 February 2006 (Supplementary Appendix E).  \n \nPotential  adverse  environmental  impacts  include  (i)  noise  and  vibration  impacts  on \n59. \nadjacent  residents;  (ii)  soil  erosion  from  cut  and  fill  activities;  (iii)  disturbance  of  historical, \ncultural,  and  archaeological  sites;  (iv)  impact  on  surface  water  quality  of  adjacent  waterways; \nand (v) public health and safety. \n  \n60. \nThe  EIA  concluded  that  the  adverse  environmental  impacts  can  be  successfully \nmitigated through the use of best practices and appropriate technologies. Implementation of the \nenvironmental management, mitigation, and monitoring programs included in the EIA will ensure \ncompliance  with  ADB  and  government  environmental  guidelines  and  procedures.  Internal  and \nexternal monitoring and audits will be conducted to ensure that standards and regulations are \n\n                                                 \n33  ADB. 2003. Guidelines for the Financial Governance and Management of Investment Projects. Manila. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n17 \n\nfollowed. An independent monitoring agency will be hired to carry out  external monitoring and \nevaluation work during implementation. \n \nE. \n\nImpact on Poverty  \n\nThe  railway  passes  through  three  provinces/region  (Shanxi,  Shaanxi,  and  Ningxia); \n61. \nseven  municipalities/prefectures  (Taiyuan,  Jinzhong,  Luliang,  Yulin,  Wuxhong,  Zhongwei,  and \nYinchuan); and  22  counties/districts,  of  which 11  are  designated  national  or  provincial  poverty \ncounties. The Project will benefit 6.5 million people in the project area, of which 70% are rural \nand  21.5%  are  poor.  There  are  1,527  designated  poverty  villages  (31%  of  total)  with  about \n979,000  poor  people  (15%)  in  the  project  area.  In  urban  areas  (two  districts),  there  are  poor \npeople with per capita income less than that of minimum living standards who will benefit from \nmore affordable travel along this corridor. The summary poverty reduction and social strategy is \nin Appendix 16. \n \n62. \nThe links between poverty, topography, and poor transport systems are apparent in the \nproject area. Poverty in this area is caused by (i) adverse environmental and weather conditions \nand  limited  farmland  (e.g.,  desert,  mountains,  cold  weather,  water  scarcity,  and  soil  erosion); \n(ii) geographical remoteness and isolation, and high transport costs; (iii) limited access to credit \nfor  rural  enterprises;  (iv)  lack  of  access  to  good  social  and  health  care  facilities;  and  (v)  high \ncost of middle and higher-level education. \n \n63. \nAbout  453,000  person-years  of  work  will  be  created  for  unskilled  laborers  during \nconstruction, of which 50% or more will be targeted at the poor, totaling 217,500 person-years \nwith  total  wages  of  CNY1,631  million.  The  use  of  locally  produced  materials  for  railway \nconstruction will generate an additional 83,000 person-years of work for unskilled laborers, with \ntotal wages of CNY605.2 million. Priority will be given to women, resettlement-affected people, \nethnic  minorities,  and  other  vulnerable  people.  When  the  new  railway  starts  full  operation  in \n2012,  an  estimated  8,954  direct  and  indirect  jobs  will  be  created  with  total  wages  of \nCNY107.4 million annually; that will increase to 13,922 jobs and CNY289.4 million in wages by \n2030.  The  estimated  construction  tax  revenue  to  counties will  be  reallocated  and used  for  the \nrange  of  poverty  reduction  and  social  activities,  including  mitigation  of  negative  impacts  on \nHIV/AIDS/STIs34, human trafficking, and the environment, with special attention to resettlement-\naffected groups, women, ethnic groups, and other vulnerable people in the project area. \n \n64. \nThe project\u2019s 41 new railway stations will be connected to the road network accessible \nby all villages, including the poor, and will create various jobs to help distribute the benefits in \nthe  project  area.  There  will  be  sufficient  space  in  and  around  the  stations  for  local  area \ndevelopment;  and  local  governments  will  support  the  poor,  women,  ethnic  groups,  and  other \nvulnerable  people  to  sell  local  specialties  and  other  goods  and  services.  Expecting  more \nefficient freight transport and business travels using the project railway, many enterprises in the \nproject  area  have  been  planning  to  expand  their  outputs  and  would  increase  labor  by  an \nestimated  52,437  jobs  as  a  result  of  the  TZR.  Revenues  generated  by  TZR  freight  traffic  will \ncreate 11,500 jobs in 2012, and increase to 36,454 jobs in 2030. All of these direct and indirect \nimpacts  will  provide  conditions  for  poor  families  to  (i)  move  away  from  unsustainable, \nmountainous  farmlands;  (ii)  have  better  access  to  markets,  and  advanced  educational  and \nhealth  facilities,  especially  for  women;  and  (iii)  build  a  sustainable  future  in  new  centers  of \neconomic activity. \n\n                                                 \n34  STI = sexually transmitted infections. \n\n \n\n\f18 \n\n \n\nF. \n\nResettlement Impact  \n\n65. \nThe  project  railway  alignment  will  cross  more  than  550  villages  in  20  counties  and \n2 urban districts from Taiyuan to Zhongwei and Yinchuan. An estimated 4,656 hectares (ha) of \nland  will  be  permanently  acquired,  of  which  42%  is  dryland,  36%  is  irrigated  farmland,  8%  is \norchard,  3%  is  vegetable  plots,  3%  is  woodland,  and  8%  is  wasteland/desert.  The  Project  will \nalso  temporarily  occupy  1,872  ha  for  TZR  construction  activities  and  access;  the  amount  has \nbeen  reduced  by  utilizing  existing  railway  lands.  An  estimated  428,395  square  meters  (m2)  of \nstructures  will  be  affected,  of  which  81%  are  residential  structures  and  other  farm  structures, \n13% are sheds, 5% are factory buildings/workshops, and 1% are school buildings. Based on the \nPRC  standard  for  impact  assessment,  about  11,803  will  lose  all  their  land  and  agricultural \nlivelihoods and 11,956 will have their houses demolished. Since the railway will only require a \nnarrow corridor, it is estimated that the average loss of land per household would be 15%, which \nmeans  the  number  of  partially  affected  people  would  be  about  78,687;  and  those  losing  more \nthan 25% would be about 8,000. Land acquisition and resettlement impacts were minimized by \naligning the railway away from urban areas, village centers, and other facilities, where possible, \nbased on consultations with communities (Appendix 15).  \n \n66.  MOR, in consultation with provincial and local governments, has prepared a resettlement \nplan  (RP)  based  on  the  preliminary  design  study;  surveys  of  79  villages;  3,487  household \nsurveys;  local  government  statistics;  and  consultations  with  local  officials,  village  leaders,  and \naffected  households.  Although  the  total  amount  of  land  and  people  affected  are  large,  these \nimpacts  are  spread  thinly  over  a  long  narrow  corridor.35 Special  assistance  will  be  provided  to \nvulnerable  households  that  include  the  poor,  widows,  the  disabled,  and  ethnic  minority  Hui \nhouseholds. \n \n67. \nLocal  government  land  administration  bureaus,  in  conjunction  with  railway  construction \nsupport offices, will be responsible for implementing resettlement; many activities will be carried \nout  by  township  officials  and  village  committees.  The  estimated  resettlement  cost  is \n$183.1 million,  excluding  contingencies.  Agreements  were  signed  between  MOR  and  Shanxi, \nShaanxi, and Ningxia governments whereby the local governments will fund 100% of the cost of \nland acquisition and resettlement which in turn will be an equity contribution to the Project. The \nresettlement  budget  will  be  adjusted  based  on  the  actual  measurement  of  physical  losses, \nmarket  prices,  and  final  compensation  standards.  Affected  people  have  been  consulted  about \nthe likely impacts during the feasibility and preliminary design stages. Resettlement information \nbooklets,  in  local  language,  have  been  distributed  to  affected  villages.  The  local  governments \nand MOR have endorsed the RP. The RP was uploaded to the ADB website on 14 April 2006. \nMOR will submit an updated RP to ADB by 31 December 2006. \n \n68.  MOR and municipal-level land acquisition and resettlement offices, in collaboration with \nthe  county  resettlement  offices,  will  be  responsible  for  internal  supervision  and  monitoring. \nProgress reports will be submitted to ADB on a quarterly basis, until resettlement is completed. \nMOR will then prepare a resettlement completion report for submission to ADB. In addition, an \nindependent  monitor  will  carry  out  the  external  monitoring  and  evaluation,  and  prepare \nmonitoring  reports  for  submission  to  MOR  and  ADB  every  6  months  until  completion  of \nresettlement activities; thereafter, annual evaluation investigations will be conducted for at least \n2 years and reported to MOR and ADB.  \n \n\n                                                 \n35 The  land  use  for  railways  is  much  less  compared  with  a  highway  of  equivalent  capacity  (a  16-lane  highway  is \n\nrequired to equal the cargo carrying capacity of a double-track railway).   \n\n \n\n\f \n\n19 \n\nG. \n\nEthnic Minorities \n\n69. \n The  Project  area  includes  619,400  people  with  ethnic  minority  nationalities,  which \nrepresent  9.6%  of  the  project  area\u2019s  population.  The  main  ethnic  group  in  the  project  area  is \nHui,  who  are  descendants  of  Muslim  traders  that  settled  in  Ningxia  (which  is  now  an \nautonomous  region).  About  2,000  will  be  affected  by  land  acquisition  and  resettlement. \nInvestigations revealed that the Hui villagers were integrated with the Han and shared the same \nsocioeconomic  conditions.  Since  some  of  the  affected  minority  villages  are  poor,  specific \nprovisions are included in the RP for livelihood training, employment on construction, access to \nrural  credit,  assistance  with  house  construction,  and  social  security.  The  Project  includes  a \nsocial development action plan (SDAP) to enhance benefits for poor or vulnerable people in the \nproject area. Hui minorities are included as a target group in the SDAP (Appendix 17).  \n  \nH. \n\nSocial and Gender Aspects  \n\n70. \nThe  Project  will  generate  job  opportunities  (skilled  and  unskilled)  for  the  poor,  ethnic \nminorities,  women,  and  other  vulnerable  groups,  which  will  help  develop  their  job  skills. \nSufficient  areas  for  income-generating  activities  will  be  designated  in  and  around  the  station. \nConstruction and operation-related job opportunities and those generated from the Project will \nprovide potential new sources of income for local residents. An increase in female participation \nin the labor and tourism market has the potential to increase women\u2019s net income and savings, \nimprove  overall  family  welfare,  and  improve  the  status  of  women.  Through  several  ongoing \nprograms  along  the  alignment,  the  All-China  Women\u2019s  Federation  will  specifically  address  the \nneeds of women and children. The federation will operate even more actively in the project area \nso  that  women  are  able  to  take  full  advantage  of  additional  work  and  income  opportunities \nfacilitated by the Project to build businesses that help sustain their families.  \n \n71.  Women and other vulnerable groups will benefit from the Project, and have equal access \nto project-generated employment and wages. The railway will generate demand for local labor \nand increase worker productivity and wages. Under PRC law, women are given equal rights in \nemployment.  Expansion  of  secondary  and  tertiary  industries  will  help  generate  additional \nemployment  opportunities  for  both  men  and  women.  Afforestation  activities  will  provide \nadditional employment opportunities for women relatively close to their homes.  \n \n72. \ndue  to  a  large  number  of  workers  during  construction.  The  project  area  has  much  smaller \nnumbers  of  HIV/AIDS  infection  compared  with  other  parts  of  the  PRC,  based  on  discussions \nwith  local  health  bureaus.  Local  governments  have  an  active  public  information  program  for \nHIV/AIDS awareness, including distribution of leaflets and posters, radio, and televisions. Even \nthe  poor in remote  areas  have  knowledge  of  prevention  methods  for HIV/AIDS  and  STIs.  The \nhealth  departments  in  these  provinces  have  carried  out  awareness  programs,  HIV/AIDS/STIs \nvoluntary counseling and testing, and prevention programs; these will be continued.  \n \n73. \nDuring  the  construction  period,  the  county  governments  along  the  alignment  will  raise \npublic  awareness  among  workers  and  communities.  MOR  has  experience  in  ensuring  that \ncontractors implement awareness and prevention programs during railway construction. Medical \nclinics were established in the area of construction camps, and HIV/AIDS awareness campaigns \nand  preventive  measures  for  workers  and  communities  were  organized  during  railway \nconstruction. These activities will continue during the construction and operation of the Project. \nCombined with increased awareness efforts by local government and the Department of Health, \nthe potential risks of STI/HIV/AIDS transmission will be adequately managed. \n \n74. \nAn  SDAP  has  been  prepared  in  consultation  with  local  governments  to  enhance  the \nproject benefits; ensure the adverse impacts are avoided or mitigated; and increase economic \n\nThe  construction  and  operation  of  the  railway  could  have  an  impact  on  HIV/AIDS/STIs   \n\n \n\n\f20 \n\n \n\ndevelopment benefits to the poor, women, ethnic minorities, and the vulnerable in an equitable \nand  sustainable  manner  (Appendix  17).  The  SDAP  will  (i)  enhance  job  opportunities  for  local \npeople; (ii) provide training and vocational programs for the poor, women, ethnic minorities, and \nthe vulnerable; (iii) support HIV/AIDS awareness and prevention programs; (iv) support income \nrecovery  programs  for  people  affected  by  resettlement;  (v)  provide  awareness  and  prevention \nprograms  for  safety  during  construction  and  operation;  and  (vi)  promote  local  economic \ndevelopment. This will be implemented with participation from relevant government agencies at \nthe local level\u2014including poverty alleviation offices; All-China Women\u2019s Federation; and health, \ncivil affairs, labor, and ethnic affairs bureaus. Leading groups have been formed to continue the \nprocess of consultation and coordination among various agencies during implementation. \n \nI. \n\nRisks and Assumptions \n\nThe Project is formulated to minimize potential risks. Based on experience with previous \n75. \nrailway  projects,  traffic  demand  is  estimated  conservatively.  Sensitivity  tests  indicate  that \neconomic  circumstances  would  have  to  become  substantially  adverse  for  the  Project  to  lose \neconomic viability. A potential risk is delay in implementation, which would delay the realization \nof  benefits.  MOR  has  successfully  built  railway  lines,  such  as  the  Ganzhou\u2013Longyan,  Hefei\u2013\nXi\u2019an,  and  Jing\u2013Jiu  railways.  Government,  MOR,  SPG,  SAPG,  and  NHAR  support  for  the \nProject  and  its  preparation  contributes  to  reducing  the  potential  risk  of  implementation  delays. \nEnvironmental risks will be mitigated by the  measures in the environmental management plan \n(EMP) and will be closely monitored during project implementation. \n \nThe Project will cause the relocation of 11,956 people and partial loss of land for 78,687 \n76. \npeople.  The  resettlement  plan \nfor  employment  during \nconstruction, supply of local materials, allocation of commercial space near railway stations, and \njob  training.  The  resettlement  plan  and  SDAP  will  be  closely  monitored  to  ensure  compliance \nwith ADB social safeguard policies. \n \nIntermodal competition among railways and roads will create market risks for the project \n77. \nrailway. However, the existing road is already congested and capacity constraints are expected \nto worsen. Traffic surveys indicate that the railway has several advantages: lower fares, shorter \ntravel times, safety, and punctuality. The increasing commercial orientation of the joint-venture \nrailway will help lower risks posed by intermodal competition. \n \n\nincludes  preferential \n\ntreatment \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\nA. \n \n78. \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents. \n \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\nReform  measures.

Despite  Government  efforts  to  increase  the  country's  transport  capacity, \n1. \nserious constraints and bottlenecks remain, especially in the road and railway sectors. By the end \nof  2005,  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  transport  system  comprised  about  75,438 \nkilometers  (km)  of  railways,  1.86 million km  of  highways,  123,300 km  of  inland  waterways,  and \n2.05 million km of civil aviation routes. However, the density of the transport network ranks among \nthe  lowest  in  the  world  relative  to  either  population  or  geographic  area.  From  1978,  when \neconomic reforms were first introduced, through to 2005, the PRC experienced sustained rapid \neconomic  growth.  This  resulted  in  an  accordingly  rapid  increase  in  demand  for  transportation. \nThe  annual  growth  of  passenger  transport  was  7.6%  and  freight  transport  9.0%  during  1978\u2013\n2004. In 2005, road traffic accounted for 53.2% of total passenger-km, followed by railways with \n34.7%, civil aviation with 11.7%, and coastal and inland waterways with 0.4%. The modal split \nfor  freight  ton-km  was  61.3%  for  coastal  and  inland  waterways,  26.5%  for  railways,  11.0%  for \nroads, 1.1% for pipelines, and 0.1% for civil aviation.  \n \nRecent  Developments.  To  improve  transport  inefficiencies  and  eliminate  transport \n2. \nbottlenecks \nincreased \ninvestment  in  transport  infrastructure  in  the  Ninth  Five-Year  Plan  (1996\u20132000)  and  the  Tenth \nFive-Year Plan (2001\u20132005). Investment in transport infrastructure as a share of gross domestic \nproduct more than doubled in the last decade. A World Bank study1 indicates that total transport \ninvestment  should  be  increased  to  at  least  3.8%  of  gross  domestic  product  to  avoid  economic \ncosts  associated  with  transport  constraints.  To  meet  the  increase  in  transport  demand,  more \ninfrastructure  investments  are  needed.  The  Government  continues  to  accord  high  priority  to \ntransport.  Substantial  investments  in  the  road  and  railway  sectors  from  both  domestic  and \ninternational financing sources, including the private sector, are envisaged in the 11th Five-Year \nPlan (2006\u20132010), which is currently under preparation. \n \n3. \nFuture  Development  Priorities  and  Outlook.  The  10th  Five-Year  Plan  (2001\u20132005) \nidentified  transportation,  including  railway  development,  as  a  priority.  The  plan  envisaged \n(i) constructing  6,000 km  of  new  lines  to  provide  access  to  unserved  areas  with  the  network \nlength  reaching  a  total  of  75,000  route-km;  (ii) providing  3,000 km  of  double  lines  and \nelectrifying 5,000 km of key lines to increase capacity; and (iii) increasing operating speeds on \n5,000 km  with  the  total  length  of  such  lines  reaching  15,000 km.  A  total  investment  of \nCNY350 billion,  including  CNY270 billion  on  capital  construction  and  CNY80 billion  for  rolling \nstock,  was  planned  for  the  railway  sector.  By  the  end  of  2005,  a  total  investment  of  CNY308 \nbillion for capital construction was made for constructing 6,458 km of new lines, providing 3,725 \nkm  of  double  lines  and  electrifying  6,259  km  of  tracks.  During  2003\u20132007,  investments  for \ncapital construction are expected to reach CNY450 billion. The 11th Five-Year Plan continues to \nlay emphasis on railway development. \n \n4. \nIn 2004, the State Council approved the new railway development plan (up to 2020). The \nplan seeks to expand the railway network from 74,000 km in 2004 to 85,000 km by 2010, and to \n100,000 km by 2020. Increasing train speed is a major goal. Train speed will be raised to over \n200 km per hour on the trunk network by 2020. Priority will be given to developing railways in \nunserved areas and regions that lack transport and have remained less developed.

The  plan  also  calls  for  separating  passenger  and  freight  traffic  in  heavily \ntrafficked corridors and 12,000 km of passenger dedicated corridor will be developed by 2020. \n \nOther  Development  Partner  Operations. In the railway subsector, the Japan Bank for \n5. \nInternational Cooperation and the World Bank, in addition to the Asian Development Bank (ADB), \nhave been mainly involved in expanding the capacity of national railways. In the past 20 years, the \nJapan  Bank  for  International  Cooperation  has  provided  \u00a5578 billion  for  15  railway  projects  to \nexpand  rail  transport  capacity,  particularly  in  major  coal  transport  corridors.  It  has  also  financed \ndevelopment of new sections of the national railway network in inland provinces. Since 1984, the \nWorld Bank has provided 10 loans totaling $2.4 billion for nine national railway projects and one \nlocal railway project. \n \nB. \n \n6. \nAssistance  in  the  Sector.  ADB  has  focused  on  improving  infrastructure  in  less-\ndeveloped and poor regions to promote sustainable economic growth and reduce poverty. Since \n1989, ADB has provided 13 loans totaling about $2.6 billion to help finance the construction of \n1,921 km  of  new  railway  lines  under  eight  local  railway  projects,  and  4,597 km  of  new  railway \nlines  under  four  national  railway  projects.  These  projects  have  introduced  modern  technology \nand  improved  the  efficiency  of  railway  operation  through  institutional  and  structural  reforms. \nADB  also  provided  11  technical  assistance  initiatives  totaling  about  $5 million  to  promote  the \ncommercial  operation  of  railways,  establish  corporate  governance,  achieve  cost  recovery,  and \nimprove railway management.  \n \n7. \nEvaluation  of  Assistance.  Experience  from  completed  and  ongoing  ADB-financed \nrailway projects in the PRC shows strong commitment and generally satisfactory capabilities of \nthe  executing  agencies  for  project  implementation.  The  speed  of  implementation  has  often \nexceeded expectation at the time of appraisal. The executing agencies generally complied with \nthe \nloan  covenants.  Resettlement  and  environmental  management  were  carried  out \nsatisfactorily. Audited financial statements were submitted in a timely manner, and the audited \nfinancial  statements  were  found  generally  acceptable.  Of  ADB\u2019s  13  railway  projects,  8  are \ncomplete, 2 started trial operation, and 3 are under implementation. The key lessons highlight \nthe  need  to  (i) ensure  that  the  executing  agency  established  for  project  processing  and \nimplementation  has  adequate  capacity;  (ii) prepare  realistic  traffic  forecasts;  (iii) review \nconstraints to traffic on a network basis, and the impact on project viability of the existing and/or \nplanned  railway  lines  and  other  transportation  modes  that  may  compete  with  the  project \nfacilities; and (iv) finance railway projects with appropriately determined debt-equity ratios. The \nrailway  projects  have  contributed  to  a  dramatic  transformation  of  local  economies.  Per  capita \nrural incomes in project areas increased substantially. Living standards were raised and poverty \nreduced.  The  project  performance  audit  report2 for  the  ADB-financed  Jing\u2013Jiu  railway  project  in \nthe  PRC  concluded  that  the  project  was  successful  and  exceeded  its  original  passenger  traffic \nforecasts. \n \nC. \n \n8. \nStrategy and Priorities. ADB strategy for the railway sector has three broad objectives: \n(i) improve economic efficiency, (ii) promote growth in poor inland provinces to reduce poverty, \n\nADB Strategy \n\n                                                 \n2  ADB.  2002.

Manila.  \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 3 \n\n31 \n\nand  (iii) protect  the  environment  and  manage  natural  resources.  In  pursuit  of  these  three \nobjectives, the strategy supports developing efficient and integrated transport networks to meet \nthe needs of a growing market economy and contribute to reducing poverty through investment \ntargeting poorer areas, coupled with policy and institutional reforms. Because of the importance \nof  railway  transport  for  the  development  of  the  national  economy,  ADB  strategy  for  the  railway \nsector focuses on (i) expanding the railway system by constructing new lines in unserved areas \nthat  are  less  developed  and  poor,  (ii) modernizing  and  increasing  the  capacity  to  improve \ntransport  efficiency  on  key  routes  of  the  national  railway  system,  (iii) commercializing  railway \noperations  to  sustain  efficient  operations,  and  (iv) increasing  railway  competitiveness  in  the \ntransport system through restructuring and reform.  \n \n9. \nPoverty  Reduction.  ADB  focuses  on  four  issues  to  enhance  the  poverty  reduction \nimpacts of transport investments: (i) locating ADB-financed projects in less-developed and poor \nregions where new lines will stimulate economic development, (ii) encouraging maximization of \nemployment  of  poor  people  during  project  construction  and  operation,  (iii) supplying  local \nmaterials  that  meet  the  requirements  of  quality  and  economy  from  poor  villages,  and \n(iv) providing station access roads and link roads to widen project benefits to poor interior areas. \n \n10. \nGovernance and Policy Reform Agenda. The ADB policy reform agenda in the railway \nsector  is  contributing  to  restructuring  the  Ministry  of  Railways  (MOR),  commercializing \noperations,  supporting  management  autonomy  of  railway  operations,  developing  human \nresources, and improving financial management and accounting systems. \n \n11. \nPromoting Private Sector Development. The PRC\u2019s large infrastructure needs require \nlocal governments to shift from traditional financing modes to the capital markets. In the railway \nsector,  a  wider  role  for  the  private  sector  is  envisaged.  MOR  has  taken  steps  to  create  the \nconditions  necessary  to  attract  investments  in  the  project  facilities  and  services  from \nnongovernment  and  private  sector  sources.  Possible  areas  include  construction  of  industrial \nsidings, commercial services, tourism, containerization, and parcel-related businesses. \n \n12. \nRegional  Cooperation.  The  PRC  is  an  active  participant  in  three  regional  cooperation \ninitiatives:  (i) through  Yunnan  and  Guangxi  province  for  the  Greater  Mekong  Subregion, \n(ii) through  the  Xinjiang  Autonomous  Region  for  the  Central  Asian  republics  initiative,  and \n(iii) through Inner Mongolia with Mongolia. The improvement of cross-border trade regimes is a \ncommon feature of these initiatives. Since these programs involve the poorer areas of the PRC, \nexpanding regional markets and options could help reduce poverty. An agreement for facilitating \nthe  cross-border  movement  of  goods  and  people  has  been  developed  under  the  Greater \nMekong  Subregion  initiative.  Steps  are  being  taken  to  develop  an  institutional  framework  to \nfacilitate  the  implementation  of  regional  transport  projects,  e.g.,  Uzbekistan\u2013Kyrgyz  Republic\u2013\nPRC  railway  development  and  the  Pan-Asian railway  project  (Singapore\u2013Kunming  railway  link \nproject). \n \nD. \n \n13.

Part 2 helped address the areas of concern \nfor improving operation. However, this assistance was not \nsufficient to overcome problems associated with this project. \n\nThe PCR concluded that the project was successful.b Traffic \nexceeded forecasts, and commercial operations were \nsuccessful. There was rapid economic growth and \nsubstantial social changes resulted in the project area after \nproject completion. Jobs created in tertiary industry helped \nwomen improve their social status. The EA was restructured \ninto a joint-stock company.

Employment creation in the service industry \nincreased opportunities for women. Debt-servicing problems \nresulting from 100% debt financing were addressed by \nfinancial restructuring. Based on the successful financial \nperformance, the Guang\u2013Mei\u2013Shan Railway Company \nraised $510 million through an initial public offering on the \nNew York Stock Exchange in 1996.  \n\nFinance and marketing functions were strengthened, and \ncomputer applications developed to improve management \ninformation systems.

Since 2003, \nthe traffic has increased substantially.  \n\nThe TA helped the railway company improve commercial \norientation and knowledge of market-oriented businesses. \nThe railway company was assisted in forecasting financial \nperformance during 1999\u20132003. The EA was helped in \nassessing the year 2000 readiness of the project facilities \nand taking remedial measures. \n \n\nThe PCR and PPAR concluded that the project was \nsuccessful.f MOR acquired modern technology and \nimplemented organizational and tariff reforms that improved \nefficiency. The project helped stimulate economic growth in \nthe project area, particularly in the poverty counties in \nJiangxi province. Per capita income increased substantially \nand poverty incidence fell. This project also highlighted the \nneed to forecast freight traffic more accurately than it did. \n\nThe TA concluded that (i) a separate entity for commercial \noperation of the JJR is not desirable as it would place the \nJJR at a competitive disadvantage, and (ii) the operation \nshould be integrated with the national network. The proposal \nfor a higher tariff for the north\u2013south corridor, including the \nJJR, was put into effect.  \n\nThe PCR concluded the project was successfulg and \nresulted in rapid economic growth that has significantly \nbenefited people living in the project area. \n\nThe TA identified excessive staffing, undercapitalization, and \nunderutilization of assets as problems of local railways in \nSichuan.

The  Project  will  enhance  the  capacity  for \nrailway transportation of both passengers and freight along the east\u2013west railway corridor. \n \nFreight traffic for the TZR was forecast by commodity (i.e., coal, petroleum products, iron \n2. \nand  steel,  fertilizers,  intermodal  containers,  and  other  commodities)  in  two  categories \ndifferentiated by their economic impact: (i) traffic diverted from other modes, mainly from other \nnational  railway  routes  and  roads,  based  on  an  assessment  of  the  relative  service  and  cost \ncompetitiveness  of  the  TZR;  and  (ii)  generated  traffic  that  would  only  move  because  of  the \nexistence of a railway line where none previously existed. The traffic forecast was based on a \ntwo-tier  analysis:  (i)  national  transport  demand  based  on  historical  trends  correlating \nsocioeconomic parameters, such as gross domestic product (GDP) and propensity to travel to \ndemand  for  railway  transport;  and  (ii)  national  and  regional  railway  traffic  demand  based  on \ncommodity-specific  analysis  for  major  commodities  currently  using  other  railway  lines. 1 Traffic \nprojections  considered  expected  economic  growth,  population  increase,  tourism  development \npotential, local government development plans, market surveys, and assessments of technical \nassistance (TA) consultants and Asian Development Bank (ADB) missions. The freight volume \non the TZR is forecast to increase from about 22.22 billion ton-km in 2012 to 73.19 billion ton-\nkm in 2031, with an average annual growth rate of 6.5%.\nPassenger traffic is forecast to grow \nfrom 1.89 billion passenger-km in 2012 to 5.93 billion passenger-km in 2031, with an average \nannual growth rate of 6.2% (Table A13.1). \n \n3. \nTransportation  improvement  will  facilitate  the  development  of  natural  resources  and \nassociated industries. Local governments are seeking private sector companies to invest in their \nareas,  particularly  in  manufacturing  and  tourism.  Freight  and  passenger  traffic  forecasts  are \nconsidered reasonable given that (i) the alternative railway lines (Baolan and Longhai lines) are \nhighly  congested;  (ii)  railways  in  the  PRC  have  experienced  high  annual  traffic  growth  with \nrecent  rates  higher  than  the  assumed  growth  rates  for  freight  and  passenger  traffic;  (iii)  the \nProject  is  a  critical  link  connecting  the  western  PRC  with  the  east,  as  well  as  serving  as  a \ngateway to the PRC\u2013Eurasian rail network for intermodal transport (footnote 1); (iv) the existing \nparallel road within the project corridor is severely congested making road transport expensive \nand  hazardous;  and  (v) the  distance  saved  by  routing  traffic  through  TZR  compared  to  other \nrailway lines is about 100\u2013500 km in origin-destination pairs involving long-distance movement \nbetween the eastern and western PRC.  \n \nB.  \n\nEconomic Evaluation  \n\n \n\n4. \nCost.  The  economic  evaluation  is  based  on  a  comparison  of  with-  and  without-project \nscenarios, using constant 2005 economic prices. The project benefits and cost were revalued in \neconomic  prices  by  separating  the  cost  items  into  tradable  materials  and  equipment,  non-\ntradable materials, labor, and land. The prices were expressed in yuan using the domestic price \nnumeraire with a shadow exchange rate factor of 1.01 for foreign exchange effects. A shadow \n\n                                                 \n1  An  International  Union  of  Railways  (UIC)-sponsored  protocol  was  signed  by  26  nations  in  Washington  D.C.  on \n8 April  2005  to  establish  seamless  rail  transport  service  between  the  PRC  and  Europe  with  onward  transatlantic \nmarine service to the eastern United States. Trial dispatch of containers along this route started in the third quarter \nof 2005. \n\n \n \n\n\f46 \n\nAppendix 13 \n\nprice was used to put an economic value on the wages paid to unskilled labor, but not on wages \nfor skilled labor since no clear surplus of skilled workers exists. A shadow wage rate factor of \n0.67 was used to convert the wage rate to an economic opportunity cost of labor. \n \nBenefits. Economic benefits include (i) operating cost savings for freight and passenger \n5. \ntraffic, (ii) time saving in diverted passenger traffic from buses, (iii) generated transport benefits, \n(iv) tourism benefits, (v) avoided road infrastructure and maintenance costs, (vi) shipper savings \ndue  to  increased  railway  competition,  (vii)  avoided  road  accidents,  (viii)  pollution  reduction \nbenefits, (ix) energy savings, and (x) national productivity benefits. \n \n6. \nAlternative Analysis. Alternative transport modes and designs, particularly roads, were \nassessed  to  determine  the  least-cost  option  to  provide  sufficient  capacity  to  cater  to  the \nexpected  demand.  Building  an  electrified  double-track  railway  in  this  corridor  was  considered \nviable  to  meet  the  anticipated  traffic  demand,  given  the  railway  network  development,  type  of \ncargo  and  passengers,  and  energy  efficiency.  Eight  alternative  alignments  were  subsequently \nevaluated during the feasibility study for the following stations and sections: Taiyuan nan/Yuci\u2013\nQingxu,  Fenyang\u2013Liulin  north,  Wucheng\u2013Yihezhen,  Wupu\u2013Suide,  Zizhou\u2013Dijian,  Zhuanjing\u2013\nNiumaojing, Hongjingzi\u2013Honggouyao, and Zhongning\u2013Liujiazhuang. Criteria used for evaluation \nof each alternative included (i) railway length; (ii) cost estimates; (iii) length and difficulty of the \nconstruction of bridges and tunnels; (iv) construction period; (v) local government development \nplans; and (vi) environmental and social impacts, including resettlement.  \n \n7. \nConclusion.  The  economic  internal  rate  of  return  (EIRR)  for  the  Project  is  18.2% \n(Table A13.3).  Benefits  from  the  freight  traffic,  including  generated  benefits,  are  the  major \neconomic  benefit  (66.6%),  passenger  benefits  contributing  about  1.5%  and  other  benefits \ncomprising  the  remaining  balance.  Sensitivity  analysis  tested  seven  scenarios  to  assess  the \nrobustness of the results of the economic analysis (Table A13.4). The capital cost would have to \nbe  more  than  146%  higher  than  estimated  for  the  EIRR  to  fall  below  the  cutoff  rate  of  12%. \nConsidering the experience of ADB-financed projects in the railway sector, this switching value \nis unlikely to occur. ADB-financed railway projects in the PRC have not encountered major cost \noverruns,  and  the  contract  prices  tend  to  be  lower  than  estimated  because  the  contracting \nprocess  is  becoming  increasingly  competitive.  Freight  benefits  would  have  to  decrease  more \nthan  54%  to  make  the  Project  economically  nonviable.  A  1-year  delay  in  completion  does  not \naffect  economic  viability.  Combinations  of  adverse  effects  of  benefits  and  costs  were  also \ntested. The results showed that the Project would maintain its economic viability under plausible \nscenarios of variability. \n \n8. \nThe  economic  analysis  was  extended  to  quantify  project  risk  and  distribute  project  net \nbenefits among stakeholders. The risk analysis considered the distribution of possible values for \nkey variables, including capital costs, operation and maintenance costs, passenger traffic, and \nfreight  traffic;  and  the  probability  with  which  they  may  occur.  The  results  show  that  the  EIRR \nwould exceed 12% with 98% probability. Distribution analysis examined how project net benefits \nwould  be  distributed  by  determining  the  project  effects  for  project  beneficiaries,  such  as \npassengers,  freight  shippers,  labor,  government,  and  economy  (Table  A13.2).  The  analysis \nindicates that a large provision of benefits will accrue to the project users and the economy. \n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 13 \n\n47 \n\nTable A13.1: Traffic Forecast \n\n     2012 \n\n   2017 \n\n    2022 \n\n   2027 \n\n  2031 \n\nBy commodity (billion ton-km): \n\nItem \n\nFreight Traffic \n\n Tons (million) \n\n Ton-km (billion) \n\n   Coal \n\n   Petroleum Products \n\n   Iron and Steel \n\n   Fertilizers \n\n   Containers \n\n   Others \n\nPassenger Traffic \n\n Number (million) \n\n Passenger-km (billion) \nkm = kilometer. \nSource: Technical assistance consultant. \n\n44.58 \n\n22.22 \n\n \n\n5.57 \n\n1.65 \n\n3.00 \n\n1.21 \n\n4.48 \n\n6.31 \n\n4.78 \n\n1.89 \n\n14.54 \n\n16.45 \n\n17.29 \n\n17.99 \n\n67.73 \n\n40.94 \n\n \n\n2.04 \n\n3.97 \n\n1.47 \n\n9.39 \n\n9.53 \n\n7.26 \n\n2.75 \n\n86.22 \n\n51.80 \n\n \n\n2.35 \n\n4.98 \n\n1.78 \n\n16.31 \n\n9.93 \n\n10.07 \n\n3.82 \n\n104.02 \n\n123.11 \n\n62.15 \n\n73.19 \n\n \n\n \n\n2.59 \n\n6.05 \n\n2.11 \n\n23.98 \n\n10.13 \n\n12.85 \n\n4.64 \n\n2.81 \n\n7.08 \n\n2.42 \n\n32.60 \n\n10.29 \n\n15.62 \n\n5.93 \n\n \n \nTable A13.2: Distribution of Project Benefits \n(present values at 12%, CNY million)  \n\nDescription \n\nDifference \n\nLabor  Government  Economy \n\nFinancial \nPresent \nValue \n\nEconomic \nPresent \nValue \n\nBenefits \n1.

Construction  will  be  completed  in \nJune 2011,  the  trial  operation  will  follow  for  1  year,  and  full  commercial  operations  will \ncommence in July 2012. The cost estimates are presented in current terms. As required in the \nfinancial management guidelines, physical contingencies (5.6%) and price contingencies1 have \nbeen provided.  \n\nB.  \n\nFinancial Projections  \n\n2. \nA  set  of  tariffs  was  devised  for  freight  and  passenger  transport  service,  based  on  full \ncost recovery plus an adequate return on equity. Operating revenues from tariffs are projected \nbased on forecast of future traffic and a base average tariff rate of CNY0.1097 per ton-kilometer \n(km) for 2012, inclusive of Railway Construction Fund collections which average CNY0.033 per \nton-km. A set of tariffs was devised based on full cost of recovery plus an adequate return on \nequity,  to  achieve  close  to  optimum  financial  and  economic  performance  of  passenger  traffic \noperating  for  the  transit  (CNY  0.025),  interline  (CNY0.020),  and  local  (CNY  0.010)  traffic  with \ndue  consideration  for  affordability.  The  tariff  adjustment  will  take  place  once  every  5  years  to \nkeep up with inflation. No real increase in tariffs is expected to occur over the Project\u2019s life span. \nOther  revenues\u2014including  loading  and  unloading,  warehouse  storage,  and  parcel  service  in \ntrain stations\u2014amount to 4.5% of passenger revenue.   \n\n3. \nAnnual  incremental  operating  costs  are  estimated  as  follows:  (i)  fixed  cost  of \nCNY344,100  per  route-km  in  2012,  excluding  depreciation,  increasing  at  an  average  rate  of \n2.1% per year in current terms; (ii) passenger variable cost of CNY0.0537 per passenger-km in \n2012, excluding dry lease of rolling stock, increasing to CNY0.0603 per passenger-km in 2031; \n(iii) freight variable cost of CNY0.0306 per ton-km in 2012, excluding dry lease of rolling stock, \nincreasing to CNY0.0374 per ton-km in 2031; (iv) estimated cost of dry lease of rolling stock2 is \nCNY10.60  per  train-km  for  passenger  trains  and  CNY7.89  per  train-km  for  freight  trains;  and \n(v) other  nonoperating  expenses  are  assumed  at  CNY0.0025  per  traffic  unit  (ton-km  plus \npassenger-km).  All  incremental  operating  costs  are  projected  to  increase  annually  in  line  with \ninflation rates.  \n\nPeriodic  track-laying  maintenance  and  infrastructure  rehabilitation  will  be  required  after \n4. \n7 years of operation at a cost of CNY0.97 million per route-km. Electric power and catenary will \nbe  replaced  after  15  years  of  operation  at  a  cost  of  CNY1.800  billion.  Signaling  and \ncommunications, safety, and other equipment will be replaced after 20 years of operation at a \ncost of CNY1.712 billion.  \n\n5. \nThe accounts receivable turnover period is assumed at 2 months of the annual revenue \nand  1  month  of  the  total  working  expenses  for  accounts  payable.  The  Project  Company  will \n\n                                                 \n1   The local inflation rate is 3.3% for 2006 and 3.2% for 2007, and 3% thereafter; the foreign inflation rate is 2.8% for \n\n2006 and 1.9% thereafter. \n\n2  Rolling stock consists of a fleet of freight and passenger trains, which will not be specifically assigned to the TZR. \nMOR  will  separately  finance  the  procurement  of  rolling  stock  and  charge  a  fee  based  on  train-kilometer  (km)  to \nTZR  and  other  railways.  The  per-km  rate  will  be  based  on  dry-lease  terms  and  will  include  depreciation  charges \n(20-year economic life with 4% scrap value) and 8% return on investment. \n\n \n \n\n\f50 \n\nAppendix 14 \n\nemploy  8,954  employees  in  2012  (9.5  per  route-km).  The  average  annual  wages  and  fringe \nbenefits in 2012 are CNY30,000, escalating at 3% per year.   \n\n6. \nDepreciation is calculated on a straight-line method with an average life of 65 years for \nthe main railway structure, 10 years for track, 45 years for buildings, 15 years for electric power \nand  traction,  and  20  years  for  signaling  and  communications  and  safety  and  other  equipment \nand facilities. Applicable business taxes at an average rate of 3.24% are charged on revenue. \nCorporate  income  tax  at  33%  is  paid  on  income  after  deducting  business  taxes,  depreciation \nand interest charges, operating expenses, and any prior year losses carried forward.   \n\n7. \nThe  Project  will  be  funded  35%  by  equity  and  65%  by  long-term  loans.  The  China \nDevelopment Bank (CDB) loan will be repayable over 20 years, including a 5-year grace period. \nThe  maturity  of  the  China  Construction  Bank  (CCB)  loan  is  15  years,  including  grace  period. \nThe  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  loan  will  have  a  26-year  term,  including  a  6-year  grace \nperiod,  and  be  a  US  dollar  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  loan  with  a  0.75% \ncommitment  fee.  Projected  financial  statements  are  in  Table  A14.1  to  Table  A14.3  The \nprojected  financial  statements  indicate  that  the  forecast  revenue  under  the  base  assumptions \nare sufficient to cover annual recurrent costs; depreciation; debt repayments on the ADB, CCB, \nand CDB loans; and generate reasonable profits.  \n\nC.  \n\nFinancial Analysis   \n\n8. \nThe major assumptions used for calculation of a financial internal rate of return (FIRR) \nare (i) all calculations are based on 2005 prices, covering 2006\u20132031; (ii) capital costs include \nall  incremental  capital  expenditures  related  to  construction  and  equipment  for  the  railway,  but \nexclude  price  contingencies  and  interest  during  construction;  (iii)  operating  costs  include  all \nannual incremental expenses incurred in operating the project railway, but exclude depreciation \nand  debt  repayment  provisions;  and  (iv)  the  residual  value  equal  to  one-third  of  the  net  book \nvalue of capital investment.   \n\n9. \nThe  estimated  weighted  average  cost  of  capital  (WACC),  after  tax,  in  real  terms  was \ncalculated  using  estimated  capital  mix  and  cost  of  funds.  Costs  have  been  considered  as \nfollows: (i) the applicable 5-year LIBOR (London interbank offered rate) fixed swap rate plus a \nprovision for ADB\u2019s spread of 0.6% with a rebate of 20 basis points is used for ADB debt, (ii) the \nestimated interest rate of 5.508% per annum is used for the CDB and CCB loans, and (iii) the \nopportunity cost of equity capital was assumed to be 8%. The cost of debt is also adjusted to \nreflect  the  impact  of  income  tax  of  33%.  The  nominal  cost  is  converted  to  the  real  cost  by \napplying domestic long-term inflation rates for local currency and international long-term inflation \nrates for foreign exchange denominated debt.   \n\nThe FIRR for the Project, computed on an after-tax basis, is 8.4% (Table A14.4), which \n10. \ncompares  favorably  with  the  WACC,  computed  at  an  after-tax  basis  at  2.21%.  The  Project  is \nconsidered  both  financially  viable  and  sustainable.  Sensitivity  tests  indicate  that  conditions \ncausing the Project's viability to fall below the WACC are unlikely to occur. The sensitivity of the \nProject's financial indicators to cost and revenue variations is in Table A14.5. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n51\n\n  Table 14.1: Projected Income Statements of the Project Company \n(CNY

railway  alignment  is  944  kilometers  (km)  long  and  will  cross  3  provinces, \n7 prefecture  level  cities,  and  22  counties  and  districts.  The  resettlement  plan  (RP)  addresses \npermanent  and  temporary  impacts  caused  by  the  Project,  including  the  railway  alignment, \nstation  sites,  station  access  roads,  and  related  construction  activities.  An  estimated \n4,656 hectares (ha) of land will be permanently acquired, of which 42% is dryland, 36% paddy \nland, 8% orchard, 3% vegetable plots, 3% woodland, and 7% wasteland. Based on the People\u2019s \nRepublic of China (PRC) standard for impact assessment, the equivalent of 11,803 people will \nlose  all  their  land  and  agricultural  livelihoods,  and  11,956  will  have  their  houses  demolished. \nThe Project will also temporarily occupy 1,872 ha. An estimated 428,395 square meters (m2) of \nstructures  will  be  affected,  of  which  81%  are  residential  structures  and  other  farm  structures, \n13%  are  sheds,  5%  are  factory  buildings/workshops,  and  1%  is  school  buildings.  Land \nacquisition and resettlement impacts have been reduced by aligning the railway away from the \nmost  densely  populated  areas;  and  avoiding  villages,  cultivated  land,  and  facilities,  where \npossible\u2014based  on  consultations  with  communities  and  local  government.  However,  the  total \nnumber of affected persons is still large because of the long length of the proposed railway. \n \n2. \nThe Ministry of Railways (MOR), in consultation with provincial and local governments, \nprepared  the  RP  based  on  the  preliminary  design;  village  surveys  of  79  affected  villages; \n1,319 additional household surveys; provincial, prefecture, and local government statistics; and \nconsultations  with  local  officials,  village  leaders,  and  affected  households.  The  resettlement \nobjective  is  to  ensure  that  compensation  and  entitlements  provided  to  affected  persons  are \nadequate  to  at  least  maintain  their  \u201cwithout-project\u201d  standard  of  living,  with  prospects  of \nimprovement\u2014in line with the PRC Land Administration Law, 1998, and the Asian Development \nBank (ADB) policies on involuntary resettlement and indigenous peoples1. \n \n3. \nThe  RP  stipulates  eligibility/entitlement  provisions  for  affected  people.  Permanent  land \nlosses will be compensated by land reallocation or cash payments. Each rural village will utilize \nthe land compensation and resettlement subsidy for income restoration. The main strategies for \nincome restoration include land readjustment,  improvement of irrigation systems, development \nof  animal  husbandry  and  cash  crops,  small  business  development,  and  migration  to  urban \ncenters  for  employment.  Compensation  for  temporary  land  loss  will  be  paid  directly  to  people \naffected to offset any income loss; the land will also be restored to its original state after use. \nCompensation  for  rural  housing  losses  will  be  paid  directly  to  those  affected  at  replacement \ncost,  free  of  demolition  expenses  and  salvaged  materials.  The  affected  rural  houses  will  be \nrebuilt in scattered locations within the existing village, so minimal site development is required. \nBetter road access and provision of site leveling, water supply, electricity, telephone, and cable \nwill  be  provided.  Crop  and  tree  losses  will  be  directly  paid  to  those  affected  and  used  at  their \ndiscretion.  Urban  households,  factories,  schools  and  other  institutions,  and  enterprises  will  be \npaid  compensation  at  market  rates  for  relocation  and  reconstruction.  Urban  households  can \nselect new housing, which is widely available. Most factories will only suffer partial impacts and \ncontinue operations at the same site. For factories required to relocate, each owner will prepare \na relocation plan, which includes restoration of livelihoods and incomes for all workers. Schools \nand  other  institutions  will  be  rebuilt  based  on  the  plans  of  local  government,  to  ensure  that \nservice levels are maintained or improved. \n \n4. \nThe  resettlement  impacts  for  the  railway  project  are  spread  thinly  over  a  long,  narrow \ncorridor.  Investigations  showed  that  income  loss  from  land  acquisition  is  less  severe  because \nthis  corridor  is  developing  rapidly  and  at  least  70%  of  net  income  for  more  than  half  of  rural \nhouseholds comes from nonagricultural employment and small businesses. Special assistance \nwill be provided to any seriously affected villages and groups, especially vulnerable households \n                                                 \n1  ADB.  1998.

Ethnic minorities account for 9.6% of the \nproject  beneficiaries  and  all  are  in  Ningxia  province.  Some  of  the  Hui  households  have \nsuccessfully transitioned into the PRC\u2019s economy, while others have remained poor albeit with \nimproved living conditions. Where they are poor, this is due to the limited resources available in \nthe  area  to  all  residents  and  inability  to  take  advantage  of  opportunities,  which  reflects  root \ncauses of poverty rather than ethnicity. It is estimated that 300 Hui households will be relocated \nand  about  4,300  Hui  households  will  have  partial  loss  of  farmland.  Special  measures  are \nincluded  in  the  RP  to  ensure  they  are  adequately  rehabilitated  and  their  living  standards \nimproved.  \n \n5. \nLocal  government  land  administration  bureaus  will  be  responsible  for  implementing \nresettlement;  many  activities  will  be  carried  out  by  township  officials  and  village  committees. \nMOR  and  the  local  governments  have  extensive  experience  with  resettlement.  As  a  standard \nprocedure,  local  government  will  provide  training  to  local  officials  who  will  be  involved  in \nimplementation. The training will focus on ADB requirements, as specified in the RP, and new \nprocedures related to State Council Decree No. 28. Affected persons have been informed and \nconsulted  about  project  impacts  and  resettlement  policies  and  entitlements  at  various  stages. \nDuring  the  preliminary  design  stage,  stakeholders  consulted  included  heads  of  affected \nhouseholds;  village  heads  and  representatives;  local  government  agencies  and  departments; \nand  vulnerable  groups,  including  women  and  ethnic  minorities.  Resettlement  information \nbooklets  were  distributed  to  affected  villages.  Affected  households  will  also  be  consulted  and \ncan participate in resettlement activities, including the detailed measurement survey, location of \nunderpasses, new housing sites, and grievance redress. \n \n6. \nAffected  households  will  receive  training  and  skills  development  assistance  that  will \nfacilitate income-generating activities. Other assistance\u2014such as preferential hiring of affected \npersons by construction companies and access  to credit\u2014will also be provided. Local poverty \nalleviation  programs  provide  a  valuable  source  of  additional  assistance  to  vulnerable  groups \nand they will be targeted during the implementation of the RP. In addition, the provinces have \nestablished  programs  that  directly  benefit  affected  villages  and  persons.  Shaanxi  has  a  very \nactive  village  development  program  that  provides  infrastructure  and  funds  for  rural  enterprise \ndevelopment  that  will  be  doubled  during  the  11th  Five-Year  Plan.  Ningxia  has  implemented  a \nvillage  relocation  program  that  provides  new  and  higher  standard  housing,  infrastructure,  and \naccess to services such as health clinics whereby local government provides 50% of the funding \nand the village supplies 50%. Similar support will be available to project affected villages, which \ncan use their compensation funds toward their 50% contribution to the program.   \n \n7. \nMOR  and  prefecture-level  land  administration  offices,  in  collaboration  with  the  affected \ncounty  offices,  will  be  responsible  for  internal  supervision  and  monitoring  of  compensation \npayments,  house  rebuilding/relocation,  land  redistribution,  and  grievance  redress.  MOR  and \nlocal  governments  have  extensive  experience  in  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  (e.g.,  the \nexpressway  now  under  construction  that  parallels  TZR,  and  other  roads  in  the  area).  This \nexperience will facilitate resettlement implementation for this Project. MOR will prepare progress \nreports and submit them to ADB on a quarterly basis, until resettlement is completed. MOR will \nthen  prepare  a  resettlement  completion  report  for  submission  to  ADB.  In  addition,  MOR  will \ncontract  an  independent  monitor  to  carry  out  external  monitoring  and  evaluation.  The  tasks \ninclude  the  following:  (i)  conduct  baseline  survey;  (ii)  review  and  verify  the  compensation \npayments,  status  of  land  acquisition,  and  compensation  payments;  (iii)  assess  grievance \nredress  procedures,  affected  persons\u2019  reaction  and/or  satisfaction,  and  restoration  of \nlivelihoods;  and  (iv)  compile  lessons  learned  for  future  resettlement  planning.  The  external \nmonitor  will  prepare  monitoring  reports  for  submission  to  MOR  and  ADB  every  6  months  until \ncompletion  of  resettlement  activities;  thereafter,  annual  evaluation  investigations  will  be \nconducted for at least 2 years and reported to MOR and ADB. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f56 \n\nAppendix 15 \n\nTable A15: Resettlement Supervision Milestones \n(as of 23 October 2006) \n\n \nNo. \n1. \n1.1 \n\n1.2 \n\n1.3 \n1.4 \n1.5 \n2. \n2.1 \n2.2 \n\n2.3 \n3. \n3.1 \n3.1a \n3.2 \n3.3 \n3.4 \n4. \n5. \n5.1 \n5.2 \n\n5.3 \n5.4 \n6. \n6.1 \n\n6.2 \n7. \n7.1 \n7.2 \n7.3 \n7.4 \n7.5 \n7.6 \n7.7 \n8. \n9. \n\n \nResettlement Tasks \n\nDisclosure \nDistribution of resettlement \ninformation booklets  \nRP circulation to local offices \n\nNotification to AF of removal \nDraft RP placed on ADB website \nFinal RP placed on ADB website \nResettlement Plan & Budget \nCompletion of staking survey \nApproval of RP and budget \n\nUpdated RP submitted to ADB \nCompensation Agreements \nProvincial agreements with MOR \nProvincial compensation rates \nVillage agreements for land transfer \nHousehold agreements \nEnterprise and institution agreements \nDetailed Measurement Surveys \nRehabilitation Plans \nVillage Rehabilitation Plans \nEnterprise Relocation Plans \n\nPlan for Vulnerable Households  \nTechnical training plan for AF  \nImplementation Capacity \nTraining for resettlement staff of \nLGRCSO in 7 municipalities \nTraining for staff of LGRCSO \nMonitoring & Evaluation \nBaseline survey \nSet-up internal supervision \nContract external monitor  \nInternal monitoring reports \nExternal monitoring \nEvaluation investigations \nResettlement completion report \nDocumentation of Consultation \nDocumentation of Grievances \n\n \nTarget \n\nResponsible \nAgency \n\nMOR \n\n \nMOR/LGRCSO \n\n \n550 affected \nvillages \n3 provinces  \n22 counties \nFirst Contract \n \n \n \n944 km \n$183 million   MOR/SPG/SAPG/ \n\nLGRCSO \nMOR, ADB \nMOR, ADB \n \nTSDI \n\nAfter DMS \n \n3 agreements \n3 provinces \n550 villages \n3,000 AF \n50 units \n \n \n10 villages \n25 \nenterprises \nTBD \n1,000 AF \n \n7 x 40 staff \n\nLocal staff \n \n1,000 AFb \nAs per RP \nAs per RP \nQuarterly \nSemiannual \nAnnual  \nOnce \nAs per RP \nAs required \n\nNHAR \nMOR/LGRCSO \n \nMOR/SPG/SAPG/ \nNHAR \nLGRCSO \nLGRCSO \nLGRCSO \nTSDI, LGRCSO \n \nLGRCSO \nLGRCSO \n\nLGRCSO \nLGRCSO \n \nLGRCSO/MOR/ \nADB \nLGRCSO \n \nExternal monitor \nMOR/LGRCSO \nMOR \nMOR/LGRCSO \nExternal monitor \nExternal monitor \nMOR/LGRCSO \nLGRCSO \nLGRCSO \n\nCompletion \nDate \n\n \n10 Mar 2006 \n\n \nStatus \n\n \nCompleted  \n\n15 Mar 2006 \n\nCompleted \n\n15 May 2006 \n15 Mar 2006 \n31 May 2006 \n \n30 Nov 2005 \n10 Mar 2006 \n\n31 Dec 2006 \n \n2004 & 2005 \n1 May 2006 \nJul 2006a \nJul 2006a \nSep 2006a \nApr\u2013Dec 2006 \n \n31 Dec 2006 \n31 Dec 2006 \n\n31 Mar 2007 \n31 Aug 2006 \n \nJuly/Aug 2006 \n\nMar\u2013Sep 2006 \n \nNov 2006 \nApr 2006 \nDec 2007 \nMar 2007c \nJan 2007c \nJan 2008c \n2009 \n \n \n\nCompleted \nCompleted \nCompleted \n \nCompleted \nCompleted \n\n \n \nCompleted \nCompleted \nStarted \nStarted \nStarted \nOngoing \n \n \n \n\nAfter DMS \nStarted \n \nCompleted \n\nCompleted \n \n \nCompleted \n \n \n \n \n \nOngoing \nTo be \nrecorded \nStarted \n \n\n \n \n \n\n10. \n11. \n\nJan 2006 \n \n\nInitial funds \n \n\nCommencement of Civil Works \n\nSPG,SAPG,NHAR \n \n\nFlow of Funds/Compensation \nCommencement of Land \nAcquisition \n11.1  Clearance of ROWd \n11.2  Demolition of Housesd \n12. \nADB = Asian Development Bank, AF = affected family, DMS = Detailed Measurement Survey, FCTIC = Foreign Capital \nTechnical  Import  Center,  LGRCSO  =  Local  Government  Railway  Construction  Support  Offices  (prefecture  and  county \nlevels), MOR = Ministry of Railways, NHAR = Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, ROW = right of way, RP = resettlement \nplan, SAPG = Shaanxi Provincial Government, SPG = Shanxi Provincial Government, TBD = to be determined, TSDI = \nThird Survey and Design Institute. \na  Commencement date. \nb  10% AFs and 20% seriously AFs.  \nc  First report due.  \nd  Start date. \n Source: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\nLGRCSO/Contractor \nJun 2006 \nLGRCSO/Contractor  Aug 2006 \nDec 2006 \nContractor \n\nStarted \nStarted \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n                Appendix 16 \n\n57\n\nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY \n \n\nA. \n\nLinkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \n\nIs  the  sector  identified  as  a  national \npriority in country poverty analysis?   \n\n  Yes \n   No \n\nIs the sector identified as a \nnational priority in country poverty \npartnership agreement?   \n\n Yes \n  No \n\nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC): \nBetter  railway  transport  will  provide  an  enabling  environment  for  poverty  reduction  through  improved  access  to  markets, \nemployment,  advanced  education  and  medical  facilities,  new  knowledge  and  information,  families  working  or  studying  in  other \nregions,  and  other  social  and  economic  services,  and  facilitation  of  economic  development  and  job  creation.  Improved  access  to \nmarkets  opens  up  opportunities  for  expansion  of  locally  produced  goods  and  services.  Construction  and  operation  of  the  railway \ngenerates additional employment opportunities in local communities, providing an additional source of income for people, including \npoor households in the project area. Incoming passengers and tourists generate additional demand for locally produced goods and \nservices. In addition, construction access and connector roads for the railway construction, and local governments\u2019 development of \nlocal roads from the stations to all levels of road network and poor villages will help extend the project benefits and opportunities to \nthe  rural,  poor  communities  by  (i)  improving  local  infrastructure;  (ii)  reducing  transport  costs;  (iii) increasing  access  to  markets, \nemployment, and other economic and social services; and (iv) improving conditions for economic growth shared by the poor. \n\nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                Targeting Classification: General Intervention \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?  \nAreas along the alignment range from relatively well-off to some of the poorest in the PRC. The well-off areas near the termini of \nthe alignment have benefited from the PRC\u2019s recent economic growth. At the same time, many villages located toward the center of \nthe alignment have been isolated from these developments; this is where the very poor live. The links between poverty, topography, \nand transport systems are apparent in the project area. The main causes of poverty in the project areas are (i) natural calamity, (ii) \nlack  of  infrastructure,  (iii)  very  limited  and  unsustainable  source  of  livelihood,  (iv)  uneven  economic  development,  and  (v)  poor \nhealth. The Project will benefit about 6.5 million people in the project area. Of this amount, about 70% are rural and 21.5% are poor \nwith  a  net  income  per  capita  of  less  than  CNY900  in  2004  (nearly  $1  per  day  using  purchasing  power  parity  exchange  rate).  In \nurban areas (2 districts), 5.8% are poor with per capita income less than minimum livings standards. The railway passes through 3 \nprovinces,  7  prefectures,  and  22  counties.  There  are  1,527  designated  poverty  villages\u2014about  31%  of  all  villages  in  the  project \narea\u2014including 979,000 poor people (15% of total beneficiaries in the project area). About 9.6% of people in the project area are \nethnic minorities and almost all are Hui who live in the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region. \n \nAbout 435,000 unskilled person-years of work will be created during the construction of the railway. Half of the unskilled work will be \ntargeted at the poor, totaling 217,500 person-years at total wages of CNY1.631 billion or CNY7,500 per person-year. Priority will be \ngiven to resettlement affected people, women, and ethnic minorities. In addition, during construction, 80,693 person-years of local \nunskilled jobs will be needed for the provision of construction materials, with total wages of CNY605.2 million; it is anticipated that \nhalf of these jobs will be taken up by the poor. When the new railway starts full operation in 2012, an estimated 8,954 direct and \nindirect jobs will be created with total wages of CNY107.4 million annually; this will increase to 13,922 jobs generating CNY289.4 \nmillion in wages by 2030. The estimated construction tax revenue from the Project to counties in the project area is about CNY500 \nmillion.  This  additional  revenue  will  be  used  for  the  range  of  poverty  reduction  and  social  activities,  including  mitigation  of  the \nnegative impacts on HIV/AIDS/STIs (sexually transmitted infections), human trafficking, and the environment\u2014with special attention \nto  resettlement  affected  groups,  women,  ethnic  groups,  and  other  vulnerable  people  in  the  project  area.  The  project\u2019s  41  new \nrailway  stations  will  be  connected  to  all  levels  of  the  road  network  accessible  by  all  villages,  including  the  poor,  and  will  create \nvarious jobs to help distribute the benefits in the project area. There will be sufficient space in and around the stations for local area \ndevelopment; and the poor, women, ethnic groups, and other vulnerable people will be supported by local governments to sell local \nspecialties and other goods and services. Expecting more efficient freight transport and business journeys using the project railway, \nmany enterprises in the project area have been planning to expand their outputs and would increase labor by an estimated 52,437 \njobs as a result of the Taiyuan\u2013Zhongwei Railway (TZR). Revenues from freight traffic generated by the TZR will create 11,543 jobs \nin 2012 and increase to 36,454 jobs in 2030.  All these direct and indirect impacts of the Project will provide the conditions for the \nPRC\u2019s goal of micro-urbanization for poor families to (i) move away from unsustainable, mountainous, or desert farmlands; (ii) have \nbetter  access  to  markets,  and  advanced  educational  and  health  facilities  (especially  for  pregnant  women);  and  (iii)  build  a \nsustainable future in new centers of economic activity, and complement local governments\u2019 poverty reduction activities to achieve \nthe goal\u2014such as assisting the poor with urban migration, relocation of poverty villages, employment, local economic development, \nfarmer-based  rural  tourism,  agricultural  product  development,  and  health  and  physical  infrastructure  and  natural  resources \nimprovement. These concerted efforts will promote further progress in the Millennium Development Goals, especially Goals 1, and \n3\u20137. \n\nC.  Participation Process \n \nIs there a stakeholder analysis? \nVarious  public  consultation  and  participation  activities  have  been  conducted  for  the  Project  and  the  role  of  each  stakeholder  is \nidentified.  MOR,  Third  Survey  and  Design  Institute  (TSDI),  the  project  preparation  technical  assistance  consultants,  and  ADB \nmissions have had formal and informal consultations with local communities and government agencies through meetings, surveys, \nhousehold interviews, written communications, and workshops, totaling 15,150 people (Appendix 7). The local county and township \ngovernments  will  be  responsible  for  implementing  resettlement  plan,  and  organizing  local  labor  for  the  construction  and  local \ndevelopment, especially near the new stations and ensure the participation of, and benefits for, the poor, women, ethnic minorities, \nand other vulnerable people. \n \n\n  Yes                 \n\n   No  \n\n \n\n \n\n\f58 \n\n       Appendix 16 \n\n   No \n\n   Yes               \n\nIs there a participation strategy? \nLocal  peoples\u2019  participation  will  be  central  for  improving  their  opportunities  to  benefit  from  the  Project.  Local  groups  and  relevant \ngovernment agencies will continue to be involved in the consultation and participation process, especially during implementation of \nthe EIA and RP. Railway Construction Support Offices are being set up in each project county, and will have copies of all relevant \ndocuments.  During  construction  and  operation,  they  will  serve  as  a  key  coordinating  point  to  enhance  stakeholder  participation, \nincluding the poor, women, ethnic groups, and other vulnerable people. Leading groups have been formed at local government level \nwithin the project area, including development & reform commissions, finance, land and resources, environment protection, industry \nand  tourism;  and  they  will  include  the  offices  of  poverty  alleviation,  All-China  Women\u2019s  Federation,  health,  labor,  civil  affairs,  and \nethnic and religious affairs as required\u2014to continue the process of consultation and participation and coordinate activities by various \nagencies  to  ensure  local  benefits.  A  social  development  action  plan  (SDAP)  has  been  prepared  and  was  endorsed  by  MOR  and \nlocal  governments  on  1  March  2006.  It  will  be  implemented  and  monitored  to  ensure  good  participation  of  local  people  in  project \nactivities and benefits. \n\nD.  Gender Development \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \nAnalyses  of  gender-disaggregated  data  and  discussions  with  representatives  of  the  All-China  Women\u2019s  Federation  indicate  that \nwomen will need some assistance to fully benefit from the Project. Data collected for the poverty and social assessment and the RP \nindicate the following: (i) women comprise 49% of the total population in the project area; (ii) women primarily engage in agricultural \nactivities; and (iii) male members from poor households tend to travel further for migrant labor opportunities than nonpoor males, \nleaving  behind  a  high  percentage  of  households  headed  by  women.  Construction  of  the  railway  will  create  opportunities  for  local \narea development by (i) facilitating the flow of materials and information into the area, and (ii) accelerating the development of local \nindustry and tourism. Many service sector jobs that will be created by the railway development and the tourism sector seek women \nemployees. The All China Women\u2019s Federation will provide business management and financial assistance to women interested in \nsetting up small businesses that serve the construction crews and growing tourist sector.  \n \nPoverty  and  social  enhancement  measures  have  been  built  into  the  project  design,  and  special  mitigation  (or  protection)  actions \nhave  been  included  in  the  RP.  For  example,  members  of  the  community  will  collectively  decide  where  schools  will  be  relocated. \nWomen,  especially  female  heads  of  household,  will  be  consulted  as  schools  provide  an  informal  source  of  daycare  for  their \nchildren.  Poor  women  will  receive  assistance  so  that  their  children  can  remain  in  school,  thereby  helping  to  break  the  cycle  of \npoverty while freeing women\u2019s time during the day to work. Widows will be eligible for special assistance during land acquisition and \nresettlement. Women will be given priority for project-generated employment during construction and operation of the railway. The \nrise in female participation in the labor force and tourism market will increase women\u2019s net income, improving overall family welfare \nand increasing the status of the women.  \nHas an output been prepared?                   \nE.  Social Safeguards and other Social Risks \n\n    Yes (Appendix 17) \n\n   No \n\nItem \n\nResettlement \n\nAffordability \n\nLabor \n\nIndigenous \nPeoples \n\n \n\nSignificant/Not \nSignificant/None \n Significant \n Not significant \n None \n\n Significant \n Not significant \n None \n\n Significant \n Not significant \n None \n\n Significant \n Not significant \n None \n\nOther Risks and/or \nVulnerabilities \n\n Significant \n Not significant \n None \n\nStrategy to Address Issues \n\nThe  RP  has  been  prepared  and  information  distributed  to  affected \npeople.  \n\nThe  proposed  railway  will  provide  an  alternative,  cheaper,  safer,  and \nfaster transport along a key east\u2013west connection. Passenger tariffs will \nbe about half current bus fares, and freight tariffs will be about one ninth \nof  current  road  tariffs.  The  new  rail  network  will  create  increased \ncapacity and facilitate further economic expansion. \nRailway  construction  will  generate  considerable  direct  and  indirect \nemployment, especially for the poor. During operation, development of \nstation  areas  and  growth  of  industries  and  tourism  will  generate \nadditional employment opportunities.  \nSome 9.57% of people in the project area are from ethnic minorities; \nnearly all are Hui. Some will be affected by land acquisition. Other \nethnic groups are few and located in urban centers, so they are not \nadversely affected. Adverse impacts and special measures for the Hui \nare included in the RP, and enhancement measures are in the SDAP.  \nHIV/AIDS  and  Human  Trafficking  Awareness  and  Prevention:  The \nrailway  will  increase  the  mobility  of  goods  and  people  along  the  route, \nand  could  increase  risks  of  HIV/AIDS/STIs  among  mobile  populations \nand  local  communities,  especially  women.  The  project  area  has  much \nsmaller  number  of  HIV/AIDS  infections  compared  to  other  parts  of  the \nPRC.  The  local  health,  civil  affairs,  labor,  and  other  relevant  agencies \nwill  coordinate  with \nin  delivering \nHIV/AIDS/STIs and human trafficking prevention information, voluntary \ncounseling  and  testing,  condoms,  HIV  testing  kits,  and  STI  treatment \npackages;  and  strictly  follow  the  PRC\u2019s  relevant  laws  and  regulations \non  prevention  of  these  issues.  The  provincial  governments  have  an \nactive  HIV/AIDS  awareness  and  prevention  program  and  MOR  has \nexperience in this area. This risk will be monitored under the SDAP and \nEnvironmental Management and Monitoring Plan.  \n\nthe  construction  contractors \n\nPlan \nRequired \n Full \n Short \n None  \n\n Yes \n  No \n\n Yes \n  No  \n\n Yes \n  No  \n\n Yes \n  No  \n\n \n\n \n\n\fSOCIAL DEVELOPMENT ACTION PLAN \n\nProposed Actions \nA.
