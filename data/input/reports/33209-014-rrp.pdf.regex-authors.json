I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto Nepal for the additional financing of the Community-Managed Irrigated Agriculture Sector \nProject.1 \n \n2.  The additional financing is for the current project, which is performing well. The project \nwill expand project outputs and activities to additional areas. It has a high degree of readiness in \ndesign, implementation, and safeguards. Its design and implementation arrangements have \nbeen reviewed during loan processing, and adjustments have been made as necessary. The \nproject remains technically feasible, economically viable, and financially sound. It supports the \ngovernment\u2019s development objectives and is accorded top priority by the government.  \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.  Agriculture  is  Nepal\u2019s  primary  economic  sector;  about  80%  of  the  population  is \ndependent on it. Since most of the poor reside in rural areas, Nepal\u2019s poverty reduction strategy \nrecognizes that agricultural growth is essential for attaining broad-based economic growth and \nimproving  livelihoods.  Agriculture  is  largely  based  on  low-value  crops  and  subsistence \nproduction, with only about 17% of output traded in markets. Because agriculture growth has \nbeen erratic, determined to a large extent by climatic factors, food production remains unstable.2 \nIrrigation is an essential input to improve agriculture productivity. Nepal\u2019s recently completed \nAgriculture Development Strategy recognizes the importance of expanding the irrigated areas in \nan equitable and viable manner, and improving irrigation efficiency and management.3 The new \nIrrigation Policy (2013) also promotes improved agency- and farmer-managed irrigation systems \nto improve water efficiency and year-round irrigation.   \n4.  The expansion of irrigation from the mid-1970s provided an enabling environment for the \nuse of new high-yielding varieties and fertilizer. Irrigation expansion has also imparted a greater \ndegree of stability to farm production. Of the 2.64 million hectares (ha) of cultivable land in \nNepal, 1.77 million ha is irrigable and about 1.33 million ha has access to irrigation. Investments \nare required to rehabilitate and improve existing irrigation systems and strengthen water users \nassociations  (WUAs)  to  operate  and  maintain  them  efficiently.  Improved  agricultural \ntechnologies, availability of inputs, and the provision of supplementary irrigation during the \nmonsoon season and full irrigation in the dry season can increase rice yields from about 3 tons \nper ha per year to as high as 10\u201312 tons per ha per year.4 Dependable irrigation also provides \nfarmers with an incentive to diversify from low-value cereal crops to high-value crops such as \nfruits and vegetables, and increase their incomes and nutrition at the same time.   \n                                                \n1  Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2004. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: \nProposed Loan to Nepal for the Community-Managed Irrigated Agriculture Sector Project. Manila. The design and \nmonitoring framework of the overall project is in Appendix 1 and has been updated to conform with current ADB \nstandards. \n2  Agricultural production depends on a 4-month monsoon, when 75% of annual rains fall. Climate variability and \nchange in Nepal is projected to exacerbate existing threats to food, water, and livelihood security through \nalterations in the quantity and timing of precipitation and runoff, more atmospheric water vapor and evaporation, \nand progressive loss of glacier and snowpack storage in basin headwaters.  \n3  ADB. 2013. Preparation of the Agricultural Development Strategy: Final Report. Consultant\u2019s report. Kathmandu \n(TA 7762-NEP). \n4  ADB.  2012.  Preparation  of  the  Agricultural  Development  Strategy:  Assessment  Report.  Consultant\u2019s  report. \nKathmandu (TA 7762-NEP). \n ", "2 \n5.  The government has a mature program of assisting farmer-managed irrigation systems \n(FMIS) to upgrade their primary infrastructure. The total number of FMIS is estimated at over \n15,000, and about 3,000 have received some form of support from the government and various \ndevelopment  partners.  The  government  estimates  that  a  large  number  of  FMIS,  with  a \ncombined command area of about 250,000 ha, never received assistance. Additional financing \nfor the current project will allow rehabilitation and expansion efforts to reach a larger number of \nFMIS.  \n6.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) approved the current project on 17 November 2004 \nand it became effective on 13 January 2006. It will close on 30 September 2014. The current \nproject had the overall goal of promoting inclusive economic growth while reducing poverty in \nrural areas. Its specific objective is to improve the agriculture productivity and sustainability of \nexisting medium-sized FMIS5 and thereby enhance the livelihoods of poor men and women, \nincluding ethnic minorities and  Dalit. To achieve this objective, the project  is rehabilitating \n111 FMIS,  with  strengthened  WUAs  in  the  central  and  eastern  development  regions.  The \ngovernment  also  provides  agricultural  extension  and  livelihood  enhancement  services  in \nsubproject areas. \n7.  Project performance was assessed during preparation of the additional financing.6 Some \nof the targets for the current project were revised at midterm because of cost escalations. The \ncurrent project is likely to meet the revised targets. Upon completion of the current project in \nSeptember 2014, the total irrigation command area improved is expected to be 15,677 ha \n(target 13,700 ha). The beneficiaries will total 178,285 (target 115,600). Although it is too early \nto  assess  achievement  of  agricultural  production  targets,  the  government\u2019s  initial  findings \nindicate that the average cropping intensity in subproject areas has increased by 30% (target \n40%), and annual major crop production has increased by 42,000 tons (target 32,100 tons). The \ncurrent  project  supported  the  reformulation  and  strengthening  of  WUAs,  and  nearly  80% \nfarmers  enrolled  as  members,  on  average.  Beneficiary  contributions  totaled  4.5%  of \nconstruction costs (target 3.0%). Its gender targets have been met. Women\u2019s representation in \nWUA executive committees was 30% (target 33%) and 48% in agriculture extension activities \n(target 35%).  \n8.  The  quality  of  subproject  implementation  was  also  assessed.  Construction  works \nperformed  by  both  contractors  and  WUAs  has  been  generally  satisfactory.  Construction \nsupervision and timely supervision by the Department of Irrigation (DOI) will be improved during \nthe  project  in  light  of  lessons  learned  from  the  current  project.7 Social  and  institutional \ndevelopment focused on strengthening WUAs to manage their irrigation systems independently. \nThe current project trained lead farmers in preparing operation and maintenance (O&M) plans, \nbut more hands-on technical assistance is required through additional financing to ensure these \nplans are implemented. A new target of having an O&M and financing mechanism established \nfor each WUA has been set.  \n9.  Once the irrigation infrastructure is approved, equitable and adequate water distribution \nsystems should be established to optimize agricultural productivity. The current project did not \nallocate resources or expertise to guide WUAs in constructing water courses to bring water to \nfarm fields or in agreeing on water distribution arrangements to meet agricultural goals. The \n                                                \n5  Irrigation schemes covering 25\u2013500 ha in the hills and 200\u20132,000 ha in the Terai (the southern plains) are defined \nas medium-sized. \n6  Summary of Project Performance (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n7  Actions to improve construction management have been agreed with the government and delineated in the Project \nAdministration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). ", "3 \nadditional  financing  project  has  significantly  enhanced  procedures  and  implementation \narrangements for building WUA capacity in integrated crop and water management (ICWM). \n10.  As of 28 February 2014, overall physical progress was estimated at 96% against the \nelapsed loan period of 94%. The cumulative contract award was $16.13 million (89.6%) and \ndisbursement  was  $15.25  million  (84.7%).  Of  the  $7  million  OPEC  Fund  for  International \nDevelopment  (OFID)  loan,  the  cumulative  contract  award  is  $5.88  million  (84%)  and \ndisbursement was $4.33 million (61.85%). The current project is expected to complete the \nremaining works by the loan closing date of 30 September 2014. Due to construction bids \nsubstantially below engineering cost estimates and significant currency fluctuation, $2 million of \nthe loan was cancelled in November 2013. Compliance with loan covenants and environmental \nand social safeguards is satisfactory. The eligibility requirements for additional financing have \nbeen met.  \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n11.  Additional financing will continue to focus on rehabilitating and extending the irrigation \ncoverage of farmer-managed irrigation systems in the central and eastern development regions. \nIt will also support the rehabilitation of select irrigation systems that are currently receiving direct \ngovernment support; the management will be transferred to WUAs after system development \nand WUA strengthening. The project will be implemented through about 70 community-based \nsubprojects. \n \n12.  The expected impact will be increased national food security. The expected outcome is \nthat participating farmers increase agricultural production. Productivity will be measured through \n(i) yields of major crops increased by at least 30% in subproject areas, and (ii) cropping intensity \nin irrigated areas increased by at least 30%.  \n \nC.  Outputs \n13.  To  achieve  its  expected  outcome, the  project  will  have  four  outputs:  (i)  farmers  in \nsubproject  areas  have  improved  irrigation  infrastructure;  (ii)  WUAs  independently  manage \nirrigation systems in a socially inclusive and equitable manner; (iii) farmers adopt improved \nagricultural  practices;  and  (iv)  national  institutions  are  strengthened  for  effective  irrigation \nservice delivery.    \n \n14.  Improved irrigation infrastructure. The project will support the participatory planning, \ndetailed design, and construction of infrastructure such as diversion structures, cross-drainage \nworks, improved and extended canal systems, and flood protection facilities. All subproject \ninfrastructure design will be done in close consultation with WUAs. The project will also support \nthe construction of tertiary water courses that bring the water to farm fields. WUAs will provide \nbeneficiary contribution in labor and/or cash for subproject infrastructure costs, consistent with \nthe government\u2019s Irrigation Policy (2013). \n \n15.  Irrigation  systems  management. The  project  will  empower WUAs  to  manage  the \nrehabilitation  of  the  infrastructure,  operate  and  maintain  their  systems  without  government \nsupport, and distribute the water equitably and adequately throughout the command area. WUA \nexecutive committees will be reconstituted, as necessary, to ensure equal representation of the \nhead, middle, and tail of the canal system, and to empower women and other disadvantaged \nfarmers  to  lead  in  system  management.  WUAs  in  subprojects  that  are  currently  agency-\nmanaged will develop plans to manage their systems without government support.  \n ", "4 \n16.  Improved  agricultural  practices.  Agricultural  practices  in  subproject  areas  are \npredominantly conventional. Farmers are using their own seed stock repeatedly for 5\u201310 years, \nresulting in lost production potential. Chemical fertilizer use is unbalanced, and farmers are not \nwell trained in making organic fertilizers. Inefficient plot-to-plot flooding irrigation is regularly \npracticed rather than constructing field channels. The project will provide agricultural extension \nservices to subproject areas to build the capacity of farmers in sustainable agricultural systems.  \n \n17.  Institutional strengthening and project management. The project has supported the \npreparation of policies for irrigation and integrated water resources management, a national \nwater plan, improved procedures for project management, revised engineering manuals, and \ninstitutional strategy and action plans. The next phase of policy and institutional reforms will be \nsupported  through  additional  financing,  including  preparing  an  irrigation  act,  updating  the \nirrigation regulation, and preparing guidelines for management transfer and O&M. \n \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans  \n \n18.  The project is estimated to cost $38.3 million (Table 1). \n \nTable 1: Project Investment Plan  \n($ million) \nCurrent  Additional \nItem  Amounta  Financingb  Total \nA.   Base Costc        \n1.

The  government  has  requested  a  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to \nSDR19,418,000 from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources to help finance the project. The loan will \nhave a 32-year term, including a grace period of 8 years, an interest rate of 1.0% per annum \nduring the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter, and such other terms and conditions \nset  forth  in  the  draft  loan  agreement.  The  Government  of  Nepal  will  provide  $7.5  million \nequivalent. Beneficiaries will contribute to subproject costs through labor and cash equivalent to \n$0.8 million.

The Ministry of Irrigation will delegate the authority of project management to the DOI. \nThe DOI will be the executing agency. It has already established a central project management \noffice (CPMO) for the current project. The CPMO will be headed by a full-time project director.8 \nIn addition, it will include the following full-time staff: deputy project director, account officer, \naccountant,  and  supporting  staff  (administrative  assistant).  The  CPMO  is  responsible  for \nmanaging all aspects of project implementation.  \n21.  The Department of Agriculture (DOA) is the implementing agency. The Directorate of \nAgriculture Extension will continue to lead the project implementation unit; its program director \nwill be responsible for managing the DOA\u2019s components under the project\u2014the agricultural \ndevelopment component and agricultural aspects of the ICWM component.  \n22.  Subproject preparation and implementation will be the responsibility of the irrigation \ndevelopment divisions and subdivisions and the district agriculture development offices. The \nregional  irrigation  and  agriculture  directorates  will  monitor  subproject  implementation  and \nensure implementation progress and results.  \n23.  The implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 3 and described in detail in \nthe project administration manual.9 \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects   Arrangements \nImplementation period  July 2014\u2013July 2020 \nEstimated completion date  31 July 2020 \nManagement \n(i)   Steering committee  Secretary, Ministry of Irrigation (chair)  \nDirector General, DOI \nDirector General, DOA \nRepresentative, Ministry of Federal Affairs and Local Development \nRepresentative, Ministry of Women, Children, and Social Welfare \nRepresentative, Nepal Agricultural Research Council \nRepresentative, Ministry of Finance \n                                                \n8  The project director will be a gazetted level 1 officer. \n9  Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).   \n ", "6 \nAspects   Arrangements \nRepresentative, National Planning Commission \nProject Director, DOI (member secretary) \n(ii)  Executing agency  DOI \n(iii)  Implementing agency  DOA  \n(iv)  Implementation units  Central Project Management Office in DOI \nProject Management Unit in DOA Agriculture Extension Directorate  \nProcurement   International  3 contracts  Variable amounts \ncompetitive bidding  totaling $6.5 million \n  National competitive  50\u201367 contracts  Variable amounts \nbidding  totaling $13.7 million \nConsulting services  QCBS: Project  2,340 person- $2.84 million  \nimplementation and  months \nmanagement \nconsultants \n(national) \nIndividual: Team  25 person-months  $580,000 \nleader and irrigation \nengineer \n(international) \nRetroactive financing and/or  DOI will initiate procurement actions for goods, works, and \nadvance contracting  consultants in advance of project effectiveness.

The Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic Development (KFAED) has indicated its intention to \nprovide a loan of about $17 million equivalent to the government to finance the construction of \nsubprojects over and above those financed by ADB and the government. Activities supported by \nKFAED will be financed on a parallel basis, with ADB assuming no supervision or fiduciary \nobligations. OFID has also expressed interest to provide a loan of $30 million equivalent to the \ngovernment to finance additional subprojects beyond those to be financed by ADB and KFAED. \nThe  details  of  OFID\u2019s  involvement  are  being  finalized.  Once  the  nature  of  cofinancing \narrangement is finalized with OFID, if necessary, a separate approval of the Board will be \nsought. \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical  \n25.  The  implementation  systems  and  procedures  for  subproject  preparation,  design, \nconstruction  supervision  and  quality  control,  and  post-construction  support  for  O&M  were \nreviewed during loan processing. Relatively simple methodologies and tools were introduced, \nusing the latest technologies and internet, to achieve a higher and more consistent level of \nquality  in  project  preparation,  detailed  design,  and  monitoring  of  small-  and  medium-scale \nirrigation  schemes. This  has  included  (i)  the  introduction  of  global  positioning  system  and \ngeographic  information  system-based  survey  and  mapping  methodologies;  (ii)  the  use  of \navailable  digital  topographic  mapping;  (iii)  high  resolution  satellite  imagery;  and  (iv)  the ", "7 \ndevelopment  and  introduction  of  templates  and  automated  procedures  for  project  design, \nincluding  online  data  processing  and  report  generation.  These  standardized  procedures \nsignificantly improved the quality of subproject preparation and, as all documents are now \navailable online, review and quality control has also improved. The capacity of DOI field staff \nhas  improved,  and  they  take  the  lead  on  infrastructure  planning,  design,  construction \nsupervision, and O&M training. \n \n26.  The current project carried out very limited activities to support O&M, partly because of \nimplementation  delays.  To  improve  long-term  sustainability,  the  project  includes  support \nactivities for post-construction, including O&M training, on-farm level demonstrations, and ICWM \ntraining. Post-construction support will also be extended for one full year after completion of \ninfrastructure rehabilitation. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial  \n27.  Economic analysis was undertaken on a sample of both FMIS and agency-managed \nirrigation system (AMIS). The cultivated command area (CCA) of sample schemes is about \n50 ha in the hills, and 200 ha to 300 ha for the schemes located in the Terai.10 The AMIS \nscheme is larger, with a CCA of 450 ha. The number of households cultivating land in the FMIS \nschemes analyzed is 35 to 300 in the hills, and 170 to 350 in the Terai. In the AMIS scheme, the \nnumber of households is 850. The percentage of households cultivating less than 1 ha is 54% to \n92%, and those cultivating less than 0.5 ha is 41% to 54%. \n \n28.  Economic benefits will  derive from an increase in crop yields and diversification of \ncropping patterns toward higher value crops, resulting from improved irrigation delivery. Overall, \nan increase in the production of cereals of about 100 tons per year on FMIS schemes in the \nhills, and 480 tons per year on schemes in the Terai is expected. On the larger AMIS scheme \nanalyzed, cereal production is expected to increase by almost 800 tons per year. Incremental \nproduction  of  vegetables  varies  significantly  across  schemes  but  is  expected  to  be                 \n100\u2013800 tons per year. Annual increases in the value of production across all schemes range \nfrom  NRs12  million  to  NRs76  million.  Economic  analysis  indicates  that  for  the  FMIS,  the \neconomic internal rates of return range from 29.6% to 55.8%. The economic internal rates of \nreturn  of  the  AMIS  scheme  analyzed  is  35.5%.  Sensitivity  analysis  shows  that  scheme \neconomic viability is not sensitive to adverse changes in benefits or costs or delays in the \nattainment  of  benefits.  The  project  is  also  financially  sustainable.  Farm  income  analysis \nindicates significant increases in farm incomes, suggesting that farm households will have the \ncapacity  to  finance  the  increased  O&M  costs  associated  with  rehabilitated  irrigation \ninfrastructure through their contributions to WUAs. \n \nC.  Governance \n29.  The project supports local governance, financial and administrative decentralization, and \noversight of public development expenditure by deepening the transparency and accountability \nof public service delivery through local government units that select and manage their own \nsubprojects,  and  by  building  the  capacity  of  the  executing  and  implementing  agencies for \nfinancial discipline, responsibility, transparency, and accountability. A financial management \nassessment of the DOI and DOA was conducted, and a risk assessment and risk management \nplan was prepared.11 The assessment concluded that the DOI\u2019s and DOA\u2019s capacity is sufficient \n                                                \n10  The southern plains region. \n11  Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "8 \nto carry out the project with training and oversight from ADB. The project aims to support the \npost-conflict approach outlined in the country partnership strategy, 2010\u20132012 by identifying \nand managing potential conflict risks and opportunities.12 \n30.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government  and  the  DOI.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary \nmeasures are described in the project administration manual (footnote 9). \nD.  Poverty and Social \n31.  The  project  involves  rehabilitating  existing  irrigation  systems  that  serve  the  poor, \ndisadvantaged and vulnerable farmers, and sharecroppers in the eastern and central regions of \nNepal; and addresses the issues of hunger and undernutrition and improving access to agri-\ntechnology and inputs through improved irrigation and crop diversification and intensification\u2014\nresulting in an increase in household income for a more food-secure future. Defined on the \nbasis of food sufficiency, 30% of the proposed beneficiaries are $1.25-a-day poor.13 The project \nis based on demand-driven, participatory planning processes. A shift to irrigated agriculture and \nvegetable farming is expected to lift most of the poor above the poverty line. \n \n32.  The project is classified as having an effective gender mainstreaming theme. A gender \nequity and social inclusion plan has been made an integral part of the project design and is \ncovered by one of the covenants.14 The current project\u2019s adherence to the government policy\u2014\nrequiring  at  least  33%  women\u2019s  representation  in  all  registered  WUAs\u2014has  gradually \ndiminished opposition to women\u2019s involvement in WUA committees. However, as women\u2019s \nparticipation is deemed to be a token, this highlights the need for extra capacity building training \nfor women WUA executive members to enable them to participate on a par with local elites and \nmale counterparts. This project addresses such issues through leadership and technical training \nfor WUA executive committee members, gender equity and social inclusion sensitization training \nfor members of WUA executive committees, and training for leader farmers. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n33.  Environment. The project is classified category B for environment as it is unlikely that \nany  proposed  subprojects  will  lead  to  irreversible  damage.  Any  subproject  screened  as \ncategory A will not be financed. Potential impacts from climate change and natural disasters on \nthe project and its proposed interventions have been screened.15 Rehabilitation of irrigation \nheadworks and canals may result in a few negative impacts that can easily  be mitigated. \nScreening  for  environmental  impacts  will  be  conducted  on  each  subproject  and  initial \nenvironmental examinations prepared. The approved environmental assessment and review \nframework,  as  disclosed  on  the  ADB  website,  provides  guidance  on  categorization  and \nprocedures  to  be  followed  during  implementation.16 Contracts  for  subprojects  that  require \nenvironmental assessments will be awarded only after approval of the initial environmental \nexaminations and environmental management plans by ADB and the government (if required), \n                                                \n12  ADB. 2009.

A grievance redress committee will be established \nin  each  subproject  area  to  receive,  evaluate,  and  facilitate  resolution  of  affected  people\u2019s \nconcerns on environmental and social issues. \n34.  Involuntary resettlement. The project is categorized C for involuntary resettlement. It is \ndesigned  to  be  based  on  voluntary  donation  of  land,  on  demand,  from  the  poor  and \nmarginalized farmers, sharecroppers, and leaseholders. A voluntary land donation due diligence \nframework17 has been prepared to help assess the involuntary resettlement safeguard status of \na proposed subproject, and confirm that the selection criteria involving the voluntary donation of \nland have been met. Any subproject requiring involuntary land acquisition will be dropped. \nIrrigation improvement must be desired by a community. If any land acquisition is required for \nirrigation enhancement, community members will voluntarily donate small parcels of their land, \nand they will be considered primary beneficiaries of the enhanced irrigation facility. Procedures \nhave been established to verify that the land is being provided voluntarily by those who stand to \ngain directly, and to verify that the subproject will cause no impoverishment. Land donation \nshould not exceed 10% of a farmer\u2019s agricultural landholding within the command area, or the \nWUA  must  provide  livelihood  restitution  measures.  The  land  donation  will  be  verified  by \nwitnesses and documented. Grievance redress committees will address any grievances. The \nDOI has a long history of facilitating voluntary land donation, and the due diligence arrangement \nhas been working well under the current project which was also categorized C. No grievances \nare outstanding. \n \n35.  Indigenous peoples. The project is categorized C for indigenous peoples. While the \nproject expects to reach areas with high percentages of Janajatis (the indigenous peoples \ncommunities), the indigenous peoples safeguard requirements will not be triggered because the \nproject does not directly or indirectly affect their dignity, human rights, livelihood systems, or \nculture or cultural properties. The project is demand-driven, based on voluntary donation of land \nand is for the benefit of the poor, disadvantaged and vulnerable farmers, sharecroppers, and \nleaseholders that include the indigenous peoples communities. A due diligence framework for \nindigenous peoples impact screening, with a checklist, has been prepared. Subproject selection \ncriteria  will  exclude  proposals  that  involve  any  adverse  impact  on the  indigenous  peoples \ncommunities and that will not qualify as category C for the indigenous peoples safeguard.18  \nF.
