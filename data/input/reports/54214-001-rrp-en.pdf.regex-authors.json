THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \nemergency assistance loan to Mongolia for the Shock-Responsive Social Protection Project. \n \n2.  The Government of Mongolia has requested emergency assistance for social protection \nmeasures  to  mitigate  the  socioeconomic  impacts  of  the  coronavirus  disease  (COVID-19) \npandemic on poor and vulnerable groups. The proposed project will apply shock-response social \nprotection principles to expand food support and cash transfers on a temporary basis, utilizing the \ntargeting and delivery systems of two established national social assistance programs. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Impact of the pandemic. The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 \noutbreak a public health emergency of international concern on 30 January 2020 and a pandemic \non 11 March 2020. The WHO recommended that countries take drastic actions to contain the \ndisease, requiring an immediate response to control and prevent its spread and reduce its health, \neconomic, and social impacts, especially on poor and vulnerable groups. Mongolia's early and \nrobust response to contain the spread included strict border closures, a suspension of air travel, \nenforced quarantine for arriving passengers, closure of schools and non-essential businesses, \nand other restrictions on daily life. These measures helped keep the number of cases relatively \nlow, but the health risk-level remains high, and the curtailment of economic activity has affected \nmany parts of the economy, including small and medium-sized enterprises, the service sector, \nand mining and extractive industries. A narrow economic base and dependence on mining make \nthe economy inherently vulnerable. \n \n4.   Mongolia will experience a severe economic slowdown.1 Preliminary estimates show \nthat Mongolia will suffer losses totaling $71 million\u2013$276 million.2 Gross domestic product growth \nwill be much lower in 2020 than envisioned: the Asian Development Bank (ADB) has revised the \n2020 growth forecast to 2.1%,3 down from 6.1%,4  but a protracted global economic crisis brought \nabout by the pandemic would significantly worsen this outlook. To counter the negative impacts \nof the COVID-19 pandemic, on 27 March 2020 the government launched a countercyclical \ndevelopment expenditure program (CDEP) and announced its intention to introduce measures \nwith a cost of MNT5.1 trillion ($1.84 billion). The program includes three areas of support: social \nprotection measures to support citizens, support to vulnerable businesses and fiscal stimulus \nmeasures, and public health protection. \n \n5.  Socioeconomic impacts on the poor and vulnerable. The loss of jobs and income \ncoupled with rising food prices will particularly affect existing poor and vulnerable people. The \npre-crisis poverty rate was 28.4% in a population of 3.24 million, but this national average masks \nsignificant differences by gender, location, and age. The poverty rate is significantly higher among \nurban households headed by women (32.4%), households living in the country's eastern region \n(37.4%), and among very young children aged 0\u20134 (38.0%).5 Childhood poverty is widespread: \n \n1  ADB. Mongolia: COVID-19 Rapid Response Program. \n2  ADB. 2020. The Economic Impact of the COVID-19 Outbreak on Developing Asia. ADB Brief. No. 128, 06 March. \nManila. \n3  ADB. 2020. Asian Development Outlook 2020: What Drives Innovation in Asia? Manila. \n4  ADB. 2019. Asian Development Outlook 2019: Strengthening Disaster Resilience. Manila. \n5  National Statistics Office of Mongolia and World Bank. 2020. Mongolia Poverty Update 2018. Ulaanbaatar. \n ", "2 \n \nchildren under the age of 15 comprise 42% of the country's nearly 905,000 poor people, while \n52% live in households with more than three children. A significant share of Mongolians who are \ntechnically non-poor nevertheless live precariously close to the poverty line. Increasing the \npoverty line by half from MNT166,580 to MNT249,870 per capita per month nearly doubles the \npoverty rate to 55.7% of the population (footnote 5). About 15% of non-poor Mongolians are \nconsidered particularly vulnerable to falling into poverty as their household income falls below \n1.25 times the poverty line. Mongolia's experience with past crises indicates the adoption of \nnegative coping strategies is a risk. Negative coping strategies can include selling productive \nassets,  reducing  consumption  levels,  or  making  harmful  choices  regarding  investment  in \neducation, health, and livelihoods, all of which can impact long-term well-being.6  \n \n6.  Global social protection response. As of 22 May 2020, 190 countries have planned, \nintroduced, or adapted 937 social protection programs in response to COVID-19; the majority are \nsocial assistance transfers (559 measures, or 60% of the total).7 The most commonly used social \nassistance instruments are cash-based measures, with 283 measures in 113 countries. During a \ncrisis, expanding support using existing programs and their infrastructure\u2014such as targeting and \ndelivery systems\u2014is more efficient than creating new programs. Mongolia's Ministry of Labor and \nSocial Protection (MLSP) used the food stamp program (FSP) in this way during the most recent \nfinancial crisis in 2017. The shock-responsive social protection literature identifies several options \nfor responding to shocks using existing programs, including (i) adjusting the design of existing \nsocial protection interventions (such as waiving conditions), (ii) attaching interventions to existing \nprogram infrastructure, (iii) vertically expanding programs to temporarily increase the value or \nduration of benefits for existing recipients, and (iv) horizontally expanding programs to temporarily \nadd new recipients.8 \n \n7.  Expanded social assistance measures. The CDEP included a temporary increase in \nchild money program (CMP) benefits of MNT10,000 per child per month for 3 months (April to \nJune 2020). The total additional benefit of about $11 per child would have provided some basic \nsupport to families, but the amount is relatively low from a welfare perspective, and as a share of \nthe poverty line. Recognizing this, on 6 May 2020 the government announced an expanded \npackage of temporary social assistance measures, including (i) a further increase in the CMP, \nbringing the total to MNT100,000 per child per month for 6 months; and (ii) doubling the value of \nthe FSP to MNT32,000 per adult per month and MNT16,000 per child per month for 5 months \n(details are in paras. 9\u201310). The total cost of these two measures\u2014basic program benefits plus \ntemporary top-ups\u2014is about MNT740.6 billion.9 \n \nB.  Project Description \n \n8.  The project is aligned with the following impact: adverse socioeconomic impacts of the \nCOVID-19 pandemic reduced.10 The project will have the following outcome: basic needs of the \npoor and vulnerable, especially women and children, supported.11 \n \n \n6  ADB. 2018.

Oxford: Oxford \nPolicy Management. \n9  Other temporary social assistance measures announced on 6 May 2020 include providing benefits of MNT100,000 \nper month for 6 months in the form of social pensions for the elderly and allowances for people with disabilities, single \nparent households, and other vulnerable groups. \n10 ADB. 2020. ADB's Comprehensive Response to the COVID-19 Pandemic. Manila. \n11 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n ", "3 \n \n9.  Output 1: Poverty-targeted food support increased. Output 1 will finance a temporary \nincrease in the monthly benefit level for all FSP beneficiaries for 5 months. The cash-like benefits \nare delivered either as electronic payments to e-cards (for 70% of the recipients, mostly in urban \nareas) or as physical vouchers (for 30% of the recipients, mostly rural). Food stamps can be used \nto purchase 10 staple food items, including milk and vegetables, from more than 750 participating \nvendors nationwide.12 The FSP helps smooth consumption and protect food intake for more than \n240,500 people, among them more than 118,000 children. Women and girls comprise 53% of all \nFSP recipients. The program reaches 44,325 families (the poorest 5%). Each family receives food \nstamps worth MNT16,000 per adult and MNT8,000 per child per month. A poor family of five \nwould normally receive just over $20 per month (less than 7% of the monthly poverty line for a \nfamily of five). \n \n10.  Output 2: Child-targeted income support increased. Output 2 will finance a share of \nthe temporary increase in the monthly benefit level to all CMP beneficiaries for 6 months. The \nCMP provides monthly cash grants to children aged 0\u201317. Payments are made to accounts set \nup in the children's names, with mostly mothers as the custodians, on the condition that children \nare registered in the Integrated Household Database (IHD). As of March 2020, 1,107,130 children \n(about 93% of the total) received CMP grants worth MNT20,000 per child per month. A mother of \nthree children under 18 would receive about $21.50 (about 7.2% of the monthly poverty line for a \nfamily of five) to support her children's needs.  \n \n11.   Emergency assistance loan characteristics. The project will (i) restore economic \nactivities during and after the pandemic, (ii) mitigate immediate losses, (iii) provide immediate \nshort-term transitional assistance, (iv) be restricted to the transition phase, (v) complement efforts \nby other development partners to ease the transition from relief to normal development, (vi) not \nbe a policy-based loan.13 \n \nC.  Value Added by ADB  \n \n12.  ADB will leverage sector expertise, partner resources, and ongoing technical assistance \n(TA) to deliver shock-responsive social protection. ADB has been a leading partner in the \ndevelopment of Mongolia's social protection system over several decades, through a series of \nloans, grants, and TA projects.14 ADB supported the design and implementation of the FSP as \npart of the government's effective response to the 2009 food and fuel crisis. ADB also supported \nthe introduction of the poverty targeting system, based on a proxy means test, leading to the IHD. \nThe proposed project includes collaborative cofinancing of $5 million from the World Bank to \nsupport the CMP. The project will also leverage resources and expertise from the ongoing \nknowledge and support TA to strengthen the social welfare system.15 The TA has three outputs \nthat aim to (i) improve the capacity of social workers and social welfare policymakers (including \nto address future shocks); (ii) strengthen delivery and monitoring of community-based social \nwelfare  services;  and  (iii) support  social  welfare  research,  protection  policy  dialogue,  and \nadvocacy. Under the third output, the TA will support communication, outreach, and assessment \nof the shock-responsive adjustments to FSP and CMP benefits. Knowledge products and events \nwill contribute to the discussion on how to build permanent shock-responsive mechanisms into \n \n12 The 10 staple food items are domestic meat products, domestic dairy products, flour, butter, sugar, fruit, vegetables, \nrice, vegetable oil, and eggs. \n13 The project also meets all emergency assistance loan eligibility criteria as described in ADB. 2004.

Holistic pandemic response. The proposed project is a key part of ADB's holistic \npackage of support to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 in Mongolia.16 This package, which \nincorporates gender mainstreaming throughout, includes rapid response measures in the health \nsector, such as reallocating $1.4 million under an existing health project to procure emergency \nhealth equipment, preparing a small-scale TA project for health sector emergency response \nsystems, and approving a $1.0 million grant from the Asia Pacific Disaster Response Facility to \nsupport further procurement of emergency medical  equipment. It  also includes short-  and \nmedium-term responses such as a $30.0 million loan to support health security, a $24.0 million \nreallocation to support small- and medium-sized enterprises, and a $100.0 million countercyclical \nsupport program to help the government manage the economic impact of COVID-19 and respond \nto public health and social protection needs for vulnerable groups through the CDEP.17  \n \n14.  Robust  emergency  assistance  coordination.  ADB  is  a  regular  participant  in  \ndevelopment partner coordination activities in Mongolia and plays a leadership role in several \nsectors, including social protection.18 ADB is working closely with the International Monetary Fund \n(IMF), the World Bank, other development partners, and various United Nations agencies, \nincluding the Humanitarian Country Team, to ensure that COVID-19 pandemic responses are well \naligned and complementary. The World Bank has approved a $26.9 million investment loan in the \nhealth sector and is providing $5.0 million in parallel cofinancing for the CMP. Other development \npartners\u2014including the United Nations, Japan International Cooperation Agency, and the United \nStates Agency for International Development\u2014have all made significant contributions to the \nCOVID-19 response. \n \nD.  Summary Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n \n15.  The project is estimated to cost $265.79 million (Table 1).

The implementing agency's General Office of Labor and Welfare Services will \nensure accurate beneficiary rosters based on the IHD. The existing project implementation unit \n(PIU) for the Additional Financing of the Food and Nutrition Social Welfare Project will additionally \nsupport this project.20 Sex-disaggregated data will be collected and reported regularly to inform \nmonitoring of the gender action plan targets.

DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical \n \n19.  Social transfers as a driver of poverty reduction. Social transfers reduced poverty in \nMongolia by 1.3 percentage points from 2016 to 2018, more than any other factor including farm \nincome (footnote 5). Evidence confirms the effectiveness of the food stamp and child money \nprograms  in  promoting  food  security  and  poverty  reduction.  A  quasi-experimental  impact \nevaluation of the FSP found substantial positive impacts on food security: food stamp recipients \nate more diverse diets and were less likely to have inadequate amounts of food than the control \ngroup. The study concluded that the model is both appropriate for Mongolia and a viable long-\nterm response to food insecurity.21 Analysis of the  2016  household socioeconomic survey \nrevealed that in the absence of the CMP, the poverty rate among children would have been                       \n5 percentage points higher.22 For the poorest quintile of the population in 2018, the CMP \ncontributed an average of 9.8% of household income, while other social transfers contributed \n \n21 I.

This drops to 14.4% in the next poorest quintile, \nand 10.3% in the middle quintile (footnote 5).  \n \n20.  Poverty  targeting  system.  FSP  eligibility  is  means-tested.  The  proxy  means  test \nmethodology was initially developed with ADB support.23 Eligible families are those in the bottom \n5% in the IHD, ranked according to proxy means test scores. The CMP is targeted to children \nunder the age of 18. The benefits are universal, but conditional on being registered in the IHD. \nCMP benefits have been targeted at various times in the past. During the 2017 financial crisis, \nADB and development partners recommended that the CMP be targeted to the poorest 60% of \nchildren in the IHD. This was done for several months, but as the poverty situation worsened, the \ngovernment proposed to extend the CMP to 80% of children. The IMF and development partners \nagreed that the fiscal implications of this change were minimal, increasing fiscal expenditure by \n$22.8 million, or 0.58% of total fiscal expenditure in 2017.24 In the present context of high \nvulnerability, the potential gains from targeting the CMP are likely reduced because so many \npeople are in danger of falling into poverty as a result of the pandemic.25 \n \n21.  Building resilience through shock-responsive social protection. Social protection by \ndefinition has an overall objective of reducing vulnerability. Social assistance programs (non-\ncontributory transfers) are particularly effective at protecting poor people's income from both \nidiosyncratic shocks that affect individual households, and covariate shocks that affect almost \neveryone. Increasing food and cash transfers in anticipation of, during, or after a shock helps poor \nand vulnerable households meet their basic needs, reduces the impact of shocks, and reduces \npressure to engage in coping strategies that weaken long-term adaptive capacity. Support prior \nto an event reduces risk while support after an event facilitates effective recovery (footnote 6). \nThe project will help ensure that the population is not rendered more vulnerable to future disasters, \nincluding the dzud (severe winters resulting in livestock deaths) or other shocks as a consequence \nof adverse coping mechanisms adopted in response to COVID-19. Evidence from the food and \nfuel crisis regarding the time required for recovery demonstrates that lower income groups took \nsignificantly longer to recover. Shock-responsive transfers act as bridging assistance to help \nmaintain recent development gains.  \n \nB.  Economic and Financial Viability \n \n22.  The project\u2019s substantial economic benefits and negligible costs indicate a high economic \nrate  of  return.26 The  project  outputs  are  expected  to  generate  significant  social  benefits, \npreventing food insecurity and destitution, and protecting human capital in the face of significant \neconomic impacts resulting from COVID-19. Poor households  have a higher propensity to \nconsume than the general population, so targeted social assistance will help cushion the decline \nin consumption and gross domestic product. Government transfers are not included in a project\u2019s \neconomic costs. There are administrative costs in managing such transfer programs, but because \nthe  project  will  use  the  government's  existing  household  targeting  and  benefit  delivery \nmechanisms\u2014including direct transfers to bank accounts for 100% of child grant recipients and \nto e-cards for 70% of food stamp recipients\u2014the marginal cost of distributing the expanded \nbenefits under these programs is minimal. \n \n \n23 ADB.

The project's outcome and outputs\u2014food \nstamps and child grants\u2014are public goods with positive externalities and no opportunity for cost \nrecovery.  \n \nC.  Sustainability \n \n24.  The government's food stamp and child money programs are established national social \nassistance programs. The CMP was introduced in 2005, while the FSP was designed and piloted \nin  2009  with  ADB  support  (footnote  23).27  Both  are  institutionalized  through  government \nregulations and use the ADB-supported IHD to target benefits. Given the government\u2019s yearly \nfunding support to FSP and CMP and the relatively small impact on the government\u2019s budget, the \nproject is sustainable. To ensure continuous funding, the government will provide assurances as \npart of the loan agreement that adequate government funding will be available for the continued \nprovision of basic benefits through FSP and CMP. Continued policy dialogue on social protection \nsystem development, including targeting and consolidation, will take place through the ongoing \nADB TA project (footnote 15). \n \nD.  Governance \n \n25.  The financial management assessment update assessed the capacity of MLSP and the \nPIU of the Additional Financing for the Food and Nutrition Social Welfare Project (footnote 20), \nwhich will serve as the PIU for this  project and  handle the  project financial management \narrangements. The review considered  recent governance assessments  and implementation \nexperience  of  MLSP\u2019s  current  projects.  The  MLSP  and  the  PIU  have  adequate  financial \nmanagement systems in place and experience in implementing ADB-funded projects, and the \npre-mitigation financial management risk assessment is therefore assessed to be moderate. \nDetailed mitigation measures are described in the PAM (footnote 19).  \n \n26.  Mongolia has taken steps to improve accountability and transparency in the public sector. \nMongolia adopted the Anti-Corruption Law in 1996, ratified the United Nations Convention against \nCorruption in 2006, amended its Anti-Corruption Law in the same year to introduce criminal \npenalties for corruption, and most recently revised its Criminal Code in 2017. Despite these \nefforts, corruption continues to threaten the development of the Mongolian economy. Major \ncorruption risks include weak institutions and enforcement, lack of capacity of integrity institutions, \npolitical interference, lack of transparency and accountability, and the prevalence of conflicts of \ninterest. The ADB program combined with monitoring indicators would ensure strict compliance \nwith the program objectives and thereby minimize risks. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as \namended to date) was explained to and discussed with the government. The specific policy \nrequirements and supplementary measures are described in the PAM (footnote 19). \n \nE.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n27.  Directly  targeting the  poor and  vulnerable. The  FSP targets  the  poorest  5% of \nhouseholds using the IHD, based on a proxy means test. The pro-poor CMP delivers child-\n \n27 After piloting the FSP in the first year, the project supported national rollout in subsequent years, and food stamps \nwere adopted as a benefit with a dedicated MLSP budget in the  Social Welfare Law 2012, which also mandated the \nproxy means test as the targeting methodology. The project also supported the design and implementation of the \nproxy means test, with additional financing support for another round of the survey and capacity building. \n ", "9 \n \ntargeted income support to a particularly vulnerable population group.28 Poverty analysis confirms \nthat children are concentrated in the lower quintiles of the income distribution (para. 5). The \npandemic has directly affected children through school closures and the cessation of daily school \nlunches, which are often an important source of nutrition for poor and vulnerable children. \nProviding these meals at home adds an extra burden on families, and especially women as the \nprimary caregivers. Physical distancing and quarantine measures have clear implications on both \nthe  economy  and  the  distribution  and  intensity  of  unpaid  care  work,  which  was  already \ndisproportionately done by women and girls. UNICEF technical guidance on gender-responsive \nsocial protection during COVID-19 confirms that child grants are an effective measure to help \naddress this growing unpaid care crisis.29   \n \n28.  Significant gender benefits. Reducing food consumption is one of the first strategies \nundertaken by households during economic crises, as demonstrated during the global financial \ncrisis of 2008. The poorest women tend to reduce both the quantity and quality of the food they \nconsume to ensure their children\u2019s food quality and quantity are maintained. A 2014 impact \nevaluation of the FSP found that 40% of women in the control group reduced the quantity of food \nconsumed, compared to 39% of men. The FSP helped limit this negative coping strategy, which \nfell to 25% for both men and women in the treatment group, e.g., those who received the FSP.30 \nThe pandemic-induced economic downturn, quarantine, and school closures can fuel family \ntensions, and Mongolia has seen a sharp increase in cases of domestic violence. This may be \nmitigated through cash-based support, which can lower stress levels by increasing confidence \nthat access to food and basic needs can be maintained, and can thus act as a channel to reduce \nthe potential for violence. Individual CMP accounts are opened in children\u2019s names, and mothers \nare in most cases the account custodians, ensuring they are able to control the use of the grant.  \n \n29.  The emergency assistance loan is categorized effective gender mainstreaming. The FSP \nwill prevent food insecurity during the COVID-19 outbreak for at least 68,000 women and 58,000 \ngirls in the poorest households; 20% of these households are headed by women. The increased \nbenefit levels will help prevent reduced quality of food intake among women. The project will \nensure public awareness of eligibility and of the temporary shock-responsive expansion of \nbenefits to ensure that all children across the country can benefit from the CMP. A gender action \nplan has been prepared. Under an ongoing TA project (footnote 15), ADB will support MLSP to \nenhance sex-disaggregated data analysis and to conduct an impact assessment, including a \ngender impact  assessment,  of the  direct and indirect benefits of the adjustments to both \nprograms.  \n \nF.  Safeguards \n \n30.  In compliance with ADB's Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project's safeguard \ncategories are as follows.31  \n \n31.  Environment (category C). The project activities do not include civil works and will have \nno adverse environmental impacts.  \n \n \n28 As of March 2020, the FSP reached 58,113 girls, 60,068 boys, 54,006 men, and 68,370 women. MLSP collects sex-\ndisaggregated beneficiary data for the CMP, but data analysis can be improved. As of March 2020, 566,291 boys \nand 540,839 girls received child grants (93% of the 1,186,000 children in Mongolia), with a steady increase in children \nbeing registered following the March 2020 announcement of higher benefits. \n29 UNICEF. 2020.

The project activities do not include civil works \nand will not trigger land acquisition or involuntary resettlement impacts.  \n \n33.  Indigenous peoples (category C).  The project is socially inclusive without partiality to \nany ethnic groups. Ethnic groups will benefit from the project if they meet program eligibility criteria \nand their households are included on the beneficiary list for both poverty-targeted food support, \nand child-targeted income support. The project's benefits are national in scope. \n \nG.  Summary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n \n33.  A prolonged  pandemic resulting in severe economic impacts would  require a more \nsubstantial social protection response. This current response falls within the boundaries set by \nthe Law on Fiscal Stability 2010,32 ensuring fiscal discipline while providing space to support a \nheightened policy response if required later in the year, including the ability to accommodate \nadditional lending from development partners. It is considered unlikely that the government will \ndeprioritize social protection given the importance of social protection measures in reducing \npoverty, and the broad-based support for such measures among the Mongolian people. Social \nprotection systems are both well-established and long-standing. ADB has supported Mongolia\u2019s \nstrategic vision to modernize the social protection system through capacity building, improved \ntargeting, consolidation of benefits, and financial sustainability. Public finance-related risks such \nas corruption and fiduciary risks are mitigated by Mongolia's strong public financial management \n(PFM) legislation (e.g., the Integrated Budget Law and the Law on Development Planning), and \noperational PFM systems, including a functional Treasury single account, a unified and consistent \nchart of accounts, and an integrated government debt and financial management information \nsystem. Nevertheless, there are areas in which improvement can be made, related to the \nefficiency, effectiveness, and transparency of the PFM systems.33 To address this, the MOF has \nadopted the Public Financial Management Reform Strategy, 2018\u20132020, supported by ADB, the \nWorld Bank, the European Union,34 and the IMF.35 The risk management plan for this project is \nsummarized in Table 4 and described in detail in the risk assessment and risk management \nplan.36 \n \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigation Measures \nProlonged COVID-19 crisis   \nThe  pandemic  spreads  and  quarantine  ADB will closely monitor the situation and crisis to be able \nmeasures are extended, with more severe  to support early detection and response.
