Indonesia \ndecentralized rapidly and many of these preconditions are not yet in \nplace. The original 1999 laws governing decentralization (i) devolved \nbroad areas of responsibility for services to local governments without \nassessing their capacity to fulfill them or clearly specifying obligatory \nfunctions within those areas, and (ii) specified financial allocations to \nthe  national  and  local  governments,  including  revenue  sharing  and \ngrants. However, the allocation mechanisms are highly skewed in favor \nof resource-rich regions, and tend to exacerbate rather than mitigate \nhistorical  regional  inequalities.  Although  these  laws  were  recently \nrevised,  reforms  in  certain  areas  need  to  be  formulated  and \nimplemented in a gradual manner over the medium-term. \n \nNew laws have also been adopted that lay down the principles and \nclarify  responsibilities  for  budgeting  and  financial  management  in \ngovernment in line with international best practices and standards. The \nnew framework is a radical departure from the current way of doing \nbusiness  in  the  Indonesian  public  service,  in  that  there  is  greater \nintegration between planning and budgeting, with the latter being done \nalong functional rather than sectoral responsibilities. Implementation of \nthese reforms at the national and local government levels will require \nconsiderable institutional development in cross-cutting functions such \nas  planning,  budgeting,  and  financial  management.  Most  local \ngovernments have limited training and experience in these areas. \n \nTaking  into  account  the  implementation  environment  and  related \ncapacity constraints, the Government and the ADB have agreed that \n ", "iv \nthe  best  way  to  support  reforms  in  local  government  finance  and \ngovernance  is  through  a  phased  and  focused  approach  over  the \nmedium term that addresses the reforms in an incremental and gradual \nmanner, based on stakeholder consultations. Phase 1 consists of an \nintegrated package of support: a program loan to facilitate legal and \nregulatory  changes  and  implementation;  a  project  loan  to  provide \nsupport  for  modernizing  financial  management  information  systems \n(FMIS);  and  TA  to  enhance  the  technical  capacity  of  the  new \nintergovernmental  Regional  Autonomy  Advisory  Council  (DPOD) \ncharged with overseeing decentralization reforms.  \n   \nProgram Loan   \n   \nObjectives and  The objective of the proposed Program is to enhance the effectiveness \nScope  and efficiency of delivery of basic public services by strengthening the \npolicy, legal, and regulatory framework for decentralization as well as \ndeveloping  capacities  at  the  local  government  level  in  Indonesia. \nPhase 1  of  the  Program  aims  to  increase  accountability  in  the \nmanagement of local government finances. The Program Loan under \nPhase 1 is structured around five key outputs to achieve: (i) enhanced \nintergovernmental coordination and development of a national action \nplan  for  fiscal  decentralization  (NAPFD);  (ii)  a  strengthened  and \nharmonized  framework  for  regional  autonomy;  (iii)  a  strengthened, \nrationalized  and  harmonized  framework  for  intergovernmental  fiscal \nrelations; (iv) a strengthened and harmonized framework for planning, \nbudgeting and financial management; and (v) an enhanced awareness \nof public expenditure and financial management (PEFM) reforms and \nmodernization of FMIS. \n \nPhase 2 of the Program will consist of policy actions based on the \nNAPFD and will result in streamlined functional responsibilities between \ndifferent  levels  of  government  and  a  more  equitable  framework  for \nintergovernmental  fiscal  relations  to  ensure  that  adequate  funding \nfollows  functions.  The  agenda  for  Phase  2  reforms  includes  the \nfollowing key actions:  \n \n\u2022  clear assignment of obligatory and sub-functions amongst the \nnational, provincial and district/city governments;  \n\u2022  adoption of clear policy mandates and priorities in education, \nhealth  and  public  works  sectors  to  guide  local  level \nimplementation of national priorities, leading to finalization of \nminimum service standards in these sectors;  \n\u2022  design and submission to the President of clear policy options to \nreform the inter-governmental fiscal framework;  \n\u2022  implementation of regulatory and procedural reforms to achieve \nhorizontal and vertical equity based on continuous reviews of \nthe fiscal balance framework supported by a sound simulation \nmodel; \n\u2022  transfer of central authority and funding through special purpose \ngrants to provide for further devolution;  \n ", "v \n\u2022  regulatory reforms for local government borrowing;  \n\u2022  regulatory  reforms  and  capacity  development  measures  to \nstrengthen regional financial management;  \n\u2022  strengthening and empowerment of the DPOD to help formulate \nand implement forward looking decentralization reforms.  \n   \nFinancing Plan  A single tranche program loan in the amount of $300 million from the \nordinary capital resources of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) will be \nprovided. The loan will have a 15-year term, including a grace period of \n3 years, an interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s LIBOR-\nbased lending facility, and such other terms and conditions set forth in \nthe draft Program Loan Agreement. \n   \nProgram Period   The reforms supported under Phase 1 cover the period from 1 January \n2004 to 31 December 2006.  \n   \nProcurement  The loan proceeds will be used to finance the full foreign exchange \ncosts (excluding local duties and taxes) of items produced and procured \nin  ADB  member  countries,  excluding  ineligible  items  and  imports \nfinanced by other bilateral and multilateral sources. In accordance with \nthe provisions of ADB\u2019s Simplification of Disbursement Procedures and \nRelated Requirements for Program Loans, the proceeds of the program \nloan will be disbursed to the Republic of Indonesia as the Borrower. No \nsupporting import documentation will be required, if, during each year \nthat  loan  proceeds  are  expected  to  be  disbursed,  the  value  of \nIndonesia\u2019s  total  imports  minus  imports  from  nonmember  countries, \nineligible imports, and imports financed under other official development \nassistance is equal to or greater than the amount of the loan expected \nto  be  disbursed  during  such  year.  The  Government  will  certify  its \ncompliance with this formula with each withdrawal request. Otherwise, \nimport documentation under existing procedures will be required. ADB \nreserves the right to audit the use of loan proceeds and verify the \naccuracy of the Government\u2019s certification. \n   \nProject Loan   The project loan implements reforms in PEFM under Phase 1 through \nObjectives and  development and upgrading of related FMIS. The project consists of \nScope  five  components:  (i)  upgrade  and  expand  electronic  access  to  the  \nregional financial information system (SIKD) by 100 local governments; \n(ii) computerize  the  new  Directorate  General  of  Regional  Financial \nManagement (DG BAKD), at the Ministry of Home Affairs (MOHA) to \nenhance  oversight  of  PEFM  reforms;  (iii)  develop  and  implement \nregional financial management information systems (SIPKD) in 71 local \ngovernments;  (iv)  streamline  and  computerize  the  system  at  the \nMinistry of Finance (MOF) for review of local government regulations \n(perdas) and draft perdas on taxes and charges  for consistency with \nhigher laws and regulations; and (v) develop certification program at \nMOF for regional financial administrators. \n   \nFinancing Plan  A project loan of $30.0 million from Asian Development Fund (ADF) \nresources will be provided. The loan will have a 32-year fixed term \nincluding a grace period of 8 years, a 1% interest charge during the \n ", "vi \ngrace period, and 1.5% thereafter, and such other terms and conditions \nas are set forth in the draft Project Loan Agreement, The loan will be \nimplemented  over  about  36  months,  to  be  completed  in  December \n2008. \n   \nProcurement and  Procurement of goods and services will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nDisbursement  Guidelines  for  Procurement.  Disbursement  procedures  will  be  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook.  Consultants \nfinanced  from  the  proceeds  of  the  ADB  loans  will  be  recruited  in \naccordance with ADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other \narrangements satisfactory to ADB for engaging domestic consultants. \n   \nExecuting Agency  MOF  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  (EA)  for  the  program  loan  and \nImplementation  MOHA will be the EA for the project loan. MOF, MOHA and the National \nArrangements  Development Planning Agency (Bappenas) will be the implementing \nagencies (IA) for the program loan and MOF and MOHA will be IA for \ntheir respective components of the project loan. MOF will implement the \nSIKD, computerization of the review process for perdas on taxes and \ncharges,  and  the  development  of  certification  program  for  regional \nfinancial  administrators  components.  MOHA  will  implement  the \ncomputerization  of  DG  BAKD  and  development  of  the  SIPKD \ncomponents. \n   \nTechnical  An advisory TA of $500,000 will strengthen technical capacity of the \nAssistance  new DPOD. The TA will be financed by ADB on a grant basis.  It is \nestimated that about 8 person-months of international and 42 person- \nmonths of domestic consulting services will be required. All consultants \nwill be engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for engaging  \ndomestic consultants. Procurement of goods and services will be in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement.  \n   \nImpact, Benefits  The  Program  will  enable  local  governments  to  deliver  basic  public \nand Beneficiaries  services more  effectively and efficiently. Program benefits include: \n \nCloser  alignment  of  public  services  and  preferences  through \ngreater  devolution,  clarity  in  the  assignment  of  functions,  and  the \nprovision  of  adequate  resources  to  deliver  public  services.  Overall \nquantity, as well as quality, of public services will be enhanced under \nthe Program in line with public expectations and preferences. \n \nGreater accountability and efficiency through a strengthened and \nharmonized  policy,  legal  and  regulatory  framework  for  regional \nautonomy, fiscal balance and PEFM.. Under the revised framework, \nwhich  is  supported  under  the  Program,  local  governments  will  be \nprovided  with  clear  directions  and  guidelines  on  their  new \nresponsibilities, which will contribute to greater efficiency in budgeting, \ncontrol of expenditures and standards of financial reporting, Improved \nreporting  will  increase  accountability  of  local  governments  to  local \nparliaments and their citizens.  Computerization of the review system \nfor  local  regulations  on  taxes  and  charges  under  the  Program  will \n ", "vii \ncontribute to a more efficient, equitable and transparent taxation system \nat the local government level.  \n \nMore sustainable intergovernmental relations through establishment \nof the new DPOD and greater cooperation in service delivery between \nlocal  governments  based  on  the  enhanced  coordination  role  of  the \nprovinces under the new legal framework,which are supported under \nthe Program.  \n \n  More equitable and transparent system of intergovernmental fiscal \ntransfers  through  legal  and  regulatory  reforms  as  well  as  systems \ndevelopment under the Program. Greater horizontal equity and vertical \nbalance  are  likely  to  be  achieved  from  the  implementation  of  the \nProgram, in turn, resulting in less regional disparities. Improved flows of \nfinancial  information  from  local  governments  and  more  efficient \nprocessing  through  the  development  and  implementation  of  new \nfinancial information systems will also improve government budgeting \nand financial management practices.  \n \nStrengthened  government  capacity  through  development  of  a \ncertification  program  for  regional  financial  administrators  and \nintroduction of FMIS at DG BAKD, upgrade of SIKD, and development \nof SIPKD and a system for reviewing perdas on taxes and charges, \nwhich are supported under the Program.  \n \nImplementation  of  these  reforms  is  likely  to  benefit  all  Indonesian \ncitizens, and potential investors and creditors. In addition, the direct \nbeneficiaries  of  the  project  loan  will  be  the  constituents  of  the \nparticipating local governments that receive support under the SIKD, \nSIPKD, and tax perda review system components. \n   \nRisks and  The  Program  faces  several  risks  arising  from  the  unsustained \nAssumptions  momentum of reforms, the macro-economic and political context, and \nregional  tensions,  which  are  outweighed  by  the  above  referenced \nbenefits.  Program risks and the risk-mitigants include the following. \n \nWeak  intergovernmental  coordination.  A  primary  risk  is  the \ncontinued uncertainty in the policy framework if efforts to harmonize \npolicies, laws and regulations fail or are further delayed. In the absence \nof a coherent national framework, local governments may use their \nauthority to develop their own practices, resulting in fragmented and \nincompatible  requirements,  information,  and  systems.  This  risk  is \npartially  mitigated  through  the  adoption  of  a  harmonized  regulatory \nframework on PEFM, development of an integrated and modernized \nFMIS, and establishment and implementation of the DPOD. \n \n  Weaknesses in resolving local government debt arrears. Balanced \nintergovernmental fiscal relations, and debt restructuring in particular, \nare sensitive issues. The Government may not be willing or able to \naddress the debt arrears problem comprehensively because of strong \nopposition from key stakeholders (e.g., local governments, which may \n ", "viii \ncontinue to dispute liability for such arrears). Although the Government \nhas not engaged in any serious attempts at debt resolution, the recent \npassage of a new regulatory framework for reducing debts in specific \ncircumstances is a good move forward. Implementation of this new \nframework will be supported by the Program through initiation of debt \nrestructuring in 7 regional governments and/or regional government-\nowned water enterprises.  \n \nConstraints  relating  to  fiduciary  governance.  Given  the  different \nlayers  of  governments  and  the  complex  expenditure  and  revenue \nsharing arrangements, transparency of the budget process in Indonesia \nis relatively weak, despite the political leadership being committed to \nimprovements. In addition to the adoption of new laws and regulations \nthat  promote  PEFM  reforms,  MOF  is  taking  steps  to  improve \ntransparency through implementation of the SIKD. The Program will \npromote enhancement of the SIKD to reflect recent reforms in PEFM \nand  modernize  FMIS  at  national  and  local  government  levels  to \npromote greater reliability and consistency in information disclosure. \nEqually important will be the need to ensure that the information shared \nthrough the SIKD is adequately evaluated to guide policy formulation to \nstrengthen  inter-governmental  relations.  The  Program  will  support \ncapacity development in this area.  \n \n  Continued  political  commitment.  Sustainability  of  the  reforms  will \nrequire continued political commitment at national and local levels over \nthe  medium-term.  This  risk  is  partially  mitigated  through  the \ndevelopment of the NAPFD, which will clarify commitment for reforms in \nfiscal  decentralization  during  the  current  administration,  and  the \nestablishment of the DPOD, which will promote a more coordinated \napproach to reforms.  \n \n \n ", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.     I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on proposed loans to \nthe Republic of Indonesia (Indonesia) for the Local Government Finance and Governance Reform \nSector  Development  Program  (the  Program).  The  report  also  describes  proposed  technical \nassistance (TA) for Supporting an Effective Institutional Framework for Fiscal Decentralization \nand, if the Board approves the proposed loans, I, acting under the authority delegated by the \nBoard, will approve the TA.  \n \nII.  THE SECTOR: PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, ISSUES AND OPPORTUNITIES \n \nA.  Sector Description and Performance \n \n2.  Indonesia  is  divided  into  33  provinces  and  more  than  440  districts,  with  significant \ngeographic and demographic variations. The population per province in 2003 ranged from less \nthan 1 million in North Maluku to more than 38 million in West Java. The challenges of ensuring \neffective and efficient delivery of public services in such a vast and diverse archipelago, coupled \nwith  the  demand  for  change  following  the  downfall  of  the  regime  of  President  Soeharto, \ngenerated fresh pressures leading to the introduction of an ambitious decentralization reform \nagenda in 1998. In a radical departure from the past, when provinces acted as conduits for \ndelivering  nationally  mandated  priorities  in  an  authoritarian  and  opaque  manner,  significant \nauthority was devolved down to district governments  through the enactment of Laws on Regional \nAutonomy (22/1999) and Fiscal Balance (25/1999). These decentralization laws became fully \neffective in 2001 when about 2 million civil servants were transferred from the national to local \ngovernment level. 1 This almost doubled the local governments\u2019 share of total public spending \nfrom about 17% in 2000 to more than 30% in 2003. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has \nsupported the Government of Indonesia (the Government) since 1998 in the formulation and \nimplementation of the decentralization laws.2 \n \n3.  The  process  of  decentralization  initially  proceeded  under  complex  circumstances  as \nIndonesia was in the midst of the Asian financial crisis, followed by rapid and frequent leadership \nchanges.  Subsequently,  the  political  situation  stabilized  and  macroeconomic  management \ncontinued to strengthen since 2000 despite a series of adverse events, including several terrorist \nattacks in Bali, Jakarta and other parts of the country, the outbreak of severe acute respiratory \nsyndrome, and global factors such as the war in Iraq and rising oil prices. Following the early \nperiods of slow recovery during 2000-02, when real gross domestic product (GDP) growth was \naround  3-4%,  Indonesia  managed  to  achieve  remarkable  progress  in  macroeconomic \nmanagement with real GDP growth at levels above 5% over 2004-05, and the fiscal deficit \ndeclining from 2.5% of GDP in 1999 to 1.2% of GDP in 2004. \n  \n4.  Despite the strong macroeconomic environment and the progress in political and fiscal \ndevolution, regional disparities in terms of poverty and access to resources persist. For example, \nEast Nusa Tenggara, the poorest province in 2002, had a human development index (HDI) of \n60.3, while Jakarta, the second richest region, had an HDI of 75.6. Gross regional product (GRP) \nand poverty indicators show significant variation between regions. For example, the GRP per \ncapita of the poorest 20% of regions is less than 30% of the GRP of the richest 20%. Similarly, \n                                                 \n1  Local government refers to provinces and districts or cities. The terms local and regional are used interchangeably.  \n2  ADB. 1999. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on Proposed Loans and \nTechnical Assistance Grants to the Republic of Indonesia for the Community and Local Government Support Sector \nDevelopment Program. Manila (Loan 1678 for $120 million); followed by a range of decentralization support \ninitiatives in health, education and basic public infrastructure sectors (see Appendix 11). \n ", "2   \nsome 20% of districts had more than 30% of their population below the poverty line, while the \nupper  20%  of  districts  had  less  than  10%  of  their  population  below  the  poverty  line.  The \ncorrelation between GRP and poverty is strong, but not absolute, with some resource-rich regions \nexperiencing high levels of poverty. Papua, the third richest region in term of per capita GRP, had \nthe highest percentage of the population below the poverty level (51.2%) in 2002. There are also \nconsiderable disparities between regions in access to resources. The richest regions received 50 \ntimes more revenue per capita than the poorest in 2002.  \n \n5.  Traditionally, much of the local government development spending in Indonesia has been \ncentrally  sponsored,  financed  and implemented.  ADB  and  other  development  partners  have \nlargely supported local level development initiatives through the national Government. While the \ntransaction costs of ensuring sound public investment and project management are always high \nin a large and diverse country like Indonesia, the devolution of authority to local governments has \nbrought in new challenges. In particular, three concerns have emerged. First, an overriding issue \nhas been appropriate level of devolution with regard to financing. Second, as new entities, the \ncapacity of local governments remains nascent to plan and execute public investment projects \neffectively. Third, ensuring adequate fiduciary governance in the management of investments \nprojects is fairly complex. \n \n6.  Over the course of 2001-05, the Government, ADB and other development partners have \nbeen assessing the effectiveness of decentralization reforms. A key finding is that the speed and \ncomplexity of decentralization in Indonesia has created gaps and inconsistencies in the policy, \nlegal and regulatory framework3. While there has been no major disruption in service delivery, to \nfully  realize  the  benefits  of  decentralization  there  is  need  for  substantial  strengthening  and \nstreamlining of the legal and regulatory foundation. Furthermore, there is an urgent need to \nformulate sound and efficient modalities of financing improvements to strengthen delivery of \npublic  services  in  the  regions.  In  particular,  in  a  highly  decentralized  environment,  funding \nauthority has to be gradually devolved down to the regions, but only after ensuring that adequate \ncapacity is built and adequate governance norms are in place.  \n \n7.  In late 2003, the Government requested ADB\u2019s support in formulating and implementing a \nforward-looking decentralization reform agenda, in line with the ongoing national level reforms. \nGiven  the  complexity  and  the  political  sensitivity  of  reforms  in  this  area,  the  Government \nrequested that ADB\u2019s support be phased in over 2004-09, to facilitate reforms on a gradual and \nflexible basis. Phase 1 of the Program, being proposed for the Board\u2019s consideration, supports \n(i) formulation of an overall reform agenda spanning 2004-09, and (ii) implementation of key \nelements of the reform agenda over 2004-05. In order to guide future reforms, the Government \nhas formulated a forward-looking agenda through the adoption of a National Action Plan on Fiscal \nDecentralization (NAPFD), which will be implemented as part of the subsequent phases of the \nProgram.  \n \nB.  Issues and Opportunities \n \n  1.   Inter-governmental Fiscal Relations \n \n8.  Assignment of Functions between Different Levels of Governments: The 1999 laws \nassigned a number of specific functions to the national government and decentralized others to \nlocal governments. Although districts and cities became responsible for the delivery of services in \n                                                 \n3  There are approximately 7 Laws, 10 Government regulations, 5 Presidential Decrees and 22 Ministerial regulations \nthat are concerned with planning, budgeting, accounting, financial reporting and accountability for the national and \nlocal governments.  In addition, a whole host of new regulations are being developed. \n ", "   3\n11 key sectors, sector laws continued to assign responsibilities in many of these areas to national \ngovernment agencies as well. Moreover, equal authority and responsibilities were conferred on all \nlocal governments, irrespective of size, socioeconomic status, or fiscal and human capacities. \nThese differences in endowments, socioeconomic status and fiscal capacity affect the ability of \nlocal  governments  to  deliver  basic  services  and  reap  the  benefits  of  autonomy.  Effective \ndecentralization  is  based  on  three  premises:  (i)  functions  should  be  devolved  according  to \ncapacities;  (ii)  funds  should  follow  functions;  and  (iii)  local  governments  should  be  held \naccountable for performance. The reform agenda has not effectively addressed these critical \nissues.      \n \n9.  Inter-governmental Fiscal Relations: The original Law on Fiscal Balance defined local \ngovernment own-source revenues, shared revenues, transfers from the national government and \nborrowings. Local governments\u2019 own revenue-raising capacities are still limited, accounting for \nonly about 6% of total revenues.4 Local governments remain dependent on fiscal transfers from \nthe national government, which have increased dramatically from Rp33.5 trillion ($3.98 billion) in \n2000 to Rp123.2 trillion ($13.1 billion) in 2004.  \n \n10.  The  revenue sharing arrangements currently account for 33% of the  total transfers from \nthe national to the local governments, while the  general allocation grant (DAU), the  bulk of which \nhelps finance civil service salaries and recurrent expenditures, accounts for almost 60% of total \ntransfers to the regions. The main purpose of the DAU is to equalize fiscal capacities across \nregions to enable them to meet their new expenditure responsibilities, but in practice there have \nbeen three key constraints: (i) a hold harmless clause, which requires that no region can be \nallocated a lower DAU than the previous year, which severely limits the redistributive function of \nthe grant; (ii) a balancing factor that was originally used to compensate local governments for the \nlarge-scale transfer of staff in 2001 and is still being included in the transfer calculations; and \n(iii) the formula for computing local government fiscal capacity acts against equalization, as it \nunderestimates  the  capacity  of  resource-rich  regions  by  including  only  75%  of  the  shared \nrevenues in estimating fiscal capacity.  \n \n11.  The Law on Regional Taxes and Charges (34/2000) was introduced to establish regional \ntaxes and charges responsibilities. This law allows local governments to create new taxes and \nuser charges as long as they meet certain criteria that are fairly standard in the tax assignment \nliterature. However, this \u201cnegative list approach\u201d enables local governments to introduce a wide \narray of nuisance taxes and charges. The Government has been working on revisions to this law \nthat  will  provide  a  positive  list  of  local  taxes  and  charges  that  may  be  imposed  by  local \ngovernments. \n \n12.  In aggregate, fiscal transfers to local governments appear to be sufficient.5 However, \ndistortions  in  the  allocation  mechanisms,  including  revenue  sharing,  are  entrenching  and \nperpetuating regional disparities and horizontal inequity. For example, evidence suggests that in \n2003 the richest local governments received more than 10 times more revenue per resident \nthrough transfers than the poorest local government. \n \n13.  Regional Borrowing. Indonesia\u2019s local governments have had very little experience of \nlong-term borrowing for capital investment, outside of the lending modalities provided by the \nnational Government. Further, the legal framework for regional government borrowing has been \nunclear  and  incomplete.  The  original  decentralization  laws,  supported  by  a  Government \n                                                 \n4  The absence of an adequate revenue base limits local accountability and shields local governments from hard \nbudget constraints. \n5  Collectively, local governments are running surpluses of around 12% of total transfers. \n ", "4   \nregulation on regional government borrowing (107/2000), provided more latitude than in the past \nfor regional borrowing from domestic and foreign sources, including multilateral loans, while \nrestricting borrowing by establishing maximum debt-to-revenue ratios.6 Until 2001, multilateral \nlending  and  national  government  lending  to  local  governments  were  channeled  through  the \nregional development account (RDA) and then on-lent through subsidiary loan agreements. The \nRDA, established in 1988 in Ministry of Finance (MOF), was intended to consolidate donor and \ndomestic funds into a single source, offering standard terms to local governments. Expansion of \nthe fund was envisaged from domestic-sourced funds and repayment under subsidiary loan \nagreements as well as injections of new donor and government funds. However, the performance \nof the RDA has largely been unsatisfactory, with at least 50-60% of loans in arrears.7 \n \n14.  MOF  introduced  an  interim  mechanism  for  on-lending  development  assistance under \nMinisterial Decree (35/2003). However, before this can develop into an efficient and prudent \nsystem, several hurdles need to be overcome: (i) local government arrears under the old on-\nlending system need to be resolved before borrowing under the new mechanism can begin,8 \n(ii) reliable accounting standards and financial management information systems (FMIS) at the \nnational and local government level need to be in place; and (iii) timely, accurate, and sufficient \nfinancial  information  on  local  governments  needs  to  be  made  available.  While  the  interim \nmechanism is a medium-term solution for the provision of IFI funding for viable local government \nprojects in such sectors as urban physical and social infrastructure, the Government needs to \ncreate an enabling environment so local governments can raise capital from other sources over \nthe longer term. Clear rules and procedures need to be established to clarify and harmonize the \nregulatory framework for regional government borrowing, while at the same time ensuring overall \nfiscal viability. \n \n15.  Delivery  of  Public  Services.  Benchmarking  and  monitoring  local  government \nperformance in service delivery are essential to ensure public resources are well utilized. The \noriginal and revised decentralization laws stipulate that the obligatory functions assigned to local \ngovernments need to be evaluated against certain minimum service standards (SPM). However, \nconcerns over fiscal constraints and lack of clarity in the assignment of functions have impeded \nthe development of SPM. \n \n2.   Governance in Inter-Governmental Relations \n \n16.  Institutional Mechanisms for Inter-governmental Coordination. Given the complexity \nand \u201cbig bang\u201d nature of decentralization reforms in Indonesia, there has, as yet, been no sound \ninstitutional mechanism to coordinate the reforms or their implementation. Before the adoption of \nthe original Law on Regional Autonomy, the Government established a Regional Autonomy \nAdvisory Board to coordinate intergovernmental fiscal arrangements. The Board was chaired by \nthe Minister of Home Affairs with the Minister of Finance as the Vice Chair. While this Board had \nprovisions for two technical secretariats on finance and regional autonomy, it was not able to \nmeet more than a few times and its technical secretariats were never established. Ongoing \ndisagreement between MOF and the Ministry of Home Affairs (MOHA) also undermined its \neffectiveness. MOHA lacked the technical capacity to drive the intergovernmental fiscal agenda, \nwhile MOF lacked an official mandate. The absence of an effective institutional mechanism to \nguide decentralization reforms has led to the ad hoc adoption of inconsistent policies, laws, and \n                                                 \n6  There were overlaps and inconsistencies in the framework for regional government borrowing between these two \nlaws, some of which still need to be resolved under the new legislation.  \n7  As of 31 December 2004. One of the key reasons for the large amount of outstanding arrears appears to be the lack \nof willingness of local governments and regional government-owned water enterprises (PDAMs) to repay. \n8 The Government has been providing exemptions to this decree on a case-by-case basis to several local governments \nthat have outstanding loan arrears to the national government.  \n ", "   5\nregulations and conflicting mandates by national agencies and local governments. At the local \nlevel, coordination has become increasingly complex because of the large and growing number of \ndistrict administrations (more than 440) and because the provinces were not provided with clear \nauthority under the original Law on Regional Autonomy.  \n \n17.  Public Expenditure and Financial Management.  While the enactment of the original \ndecentralization laws increased the importance of financial management for local accountability \nand general fiscal management, the legal and regulatory framework did not fully clarify the roles \nand responsibilities of national and local governments, or of MOF and MOHA, with regard to \nregional financial management and regional financial information. Regulatory measures adopted \nin 2000 provided the basic guidelines for regional financial management, including budgeting, \naccounting methodologies, and financial reporting.  \n \n18.  With the aim of enhancing transparency and accountability at the national level, a range of \nnew  planning,  budgeting,  and  financial  management  principles  and  requirements  has  been \nintroduced. For example, the new Law on State Finance (17/2003) introduced performance-\nbased budgeting, a shift to expenditure classifications based on government financial statistics \n(GFS), and a medium-term expenditure framework (MTEF). While the original decentralization \nlaws had several provisions on local government budgeting and financial management, these \nprovisions  needed  to  be  reconciled  to  ensure  consistency  in  procedural  and  institutional \narrangements. Moreover, given that local governments currently prepare rudimentary budgets \nand  financial  statements,  implementing  such  sophisticated  tools  will  require  significant \ninvestments aimed at capacity development at the local level.  \n \n19.  Based  on  recommendations  made  by  ADB,  the  World  Bank  and  the  International \nMonetary Fund (IMF), reorganization of MOF has been underway since 2003. The aim of the \nreorganization has been to establish a modern budget and treasury management system. The \nrestructuring was necessary for MOF to exercise effective fiscal and financial management in a \ncomplex economy, particularly with the shifting roles and additional challenges brought about by \nrapid decentralization. However, attention needs to be given to the capacity of MOF to monitor \nand  adequately  manage  fiscal  risks.  Although  MOF  has  developed  a  regional  financial \ninformation system (SIKD), this system does not reflect recent reforms in the legal and regulatory \nframework. Moreover, only 19 out of 473 local governments have been provided with support to \nenable  them  to  submit  required  financial  reports  to  SIKD  through  a  computerized  financial \nreporting and transmission system. The majority of local governments submit required financial \nreports manually.  \n \nB.  Lessons Learned  \n20.  The design of the Program incorporates key issues learned from evaluation of previous \nADB projects, including the Sustainable Capacity Building for Decentralization Project (SCBD)9 \nand  the  State  Audit  Reform  Sector  Development  Program  (STAR),10  and  those  of  other \ndevelopment partners in the area of policy reforms, public expenditure and financial management \n(PEFM), and decentralization. A consistent finding is that the challenges in implementing policy \nreforms of this magnitude are overwhelming in terms of the adjustment costs and political and \ninstitutional arrangements for effective management of implementation. \n                                                 \n9  ADB. 2002. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Director on a Proposed Loan and \nTechnical Assistance Grant to the Republic of Indonesia for the Sustainable Capacity Building for Decentralization \nProject, Manila (Loan 1964 for $42.2 million). \n10 ADB. 2004. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Director on Proposed Loans to the \nRepublic of Indonesia for the State Audit Reform Sector Development Program, Manila (Loan 2126/2127 for $200 \nmillion and $25.1 million respectively). \n ", "6   \n \n21.  Government  Commitment  and  the  Pace  of  Reforms.  The  Government\u2019s  political \ncommitment to the reform agenda, including the pace of reforms, is critical. Strong ownership by \nparticipating local governments, including participation in project design and tailoring of projects \nto reflect local capacity and needs, is critical to the sustainability of reforms. \n \n22.  Complexity of Reform Program and Capacity to Implement. Given weak capacity to \nimplement program initiatives, the complexity of programs needs to be carefully examined to \nensure that outputs can be met. A longer-term horizon is needed to build political consensus on \nthe  reform  agenda,  effectively  sequence  interventions,  enable  adoption  of  an  incremental \napproach, and set realistic and achievable objectives. Flexibility about specific actions and timing \nshould be provided as long as there is strong commitment to key objectives. Consistent with the \nemerging laws and regulations, provinces should be provided with a greater role in coordinating, \nmonitoring, and facilitating support to participating district governments. \n \n23.  Intergovernmental  Coordination.  Given  Indonesia\u2019s  size  and  diversity,  coordination \namong key central government agencies and local governments will be vital to ensuring the \nconsistency of reforms. Building strong Government ownership entails involving more than one \nnational  implementing  agency.  The  success  of  the  reforms  will  depend  on  the  interrelated \nactivities of a number of key stakeholders.  \n \n24.  Accountability. In a unitary state, with the type of devolution that Indonesia has adopted, \nappropriate checks and balances on accountability are evolving. Program design should support \nimplementation of the new legal and regulatory requirements for sound planning, budgeting, \nfinancial management and evaluation. \n \n25.  Complementarity with other initiatives. Policy actions should draw extensively from \nrecommendations developed in past policy analyses and reviews by ADB and other development \npartners and build on related work (Appendix 11).   \n \nC.  Donor Coordination \n \n26.  Donor coordination is critical for Indonesia\u2019s decentralization reforms. The Program is the \nfirst comprehensive program to attempt to enhance overall coordination at the national level and \nimprove intergovernmental fiscal relations (following ADB\u2019s Community and Local Government \nSector Development Program). ADB has coordinated closely with other development partners in \nformulating  the  Program.  Consultations  have  been  held  with  the  Canadian  International \nDevelopment Agency (CIDA), United Kingdom Department for International Development (DFID), \nDeutsche  Gesellschaft  fur  Technische  Zusammenarbeit  (GTZ),  United  States  Agency  for \nInternational Development (USAID), and the World Bank, ADB has been active in the Donor-\nGovernment Working Group on Decentralization, which has recommended that the Program \nbecome  an  umbrella  for  coordinating  policy,  legal  and  regulatory  reforms  in  the  area  of \ndecentralization. At the Group\u2019s request, ADB formulated the Group\u2019s Annual Workplan for 2005-\n06 in coordinating various related initiatives under the broad framework of the Program. The \nNAPFD,  in  particular,  has  benefited  from  consultations  with  other  development  partners \nsupporting decentralization reforms, within the framework of the Decentralization Support Facility \nfounded by DFID, the World Bank, ADB, and the United Nations Development Program.  \n \n ", "   7\nIII.  THE PROPOSED SECTOR DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM \n \nA.      Objectives and Scope  \n \n27.  The  key  objective  of  the  Program  is  to  enhance  the  development  effectiveness  and \nefficiency of public services delivery at the local government level.  This is crucial for Indonesia as \nthe delivery of all major socio-economic services has been devolved to the local level, while \nhorizontal  and  vertical  inequities  in  the  resource  allocation  mechanism  remain.  Local \ngovernments  have  inherited  enormous  responsibilities  without  adequate  preparation  and \ncapacities. In addition to governance concerns, the delivery of public services has been impeded \nby administrative weaknesses in implementation as well as financial management, auditing and \naccounting.   ADB has been proactively engaged in addressing these challenges through a \nnumber of operations, some of which are project interventions directed at improving coverage of \nsocio-economic services, while other interventions aim to strengthen capacities in a sustainable \nway such as ADB's support through SCBD and the STAR projects (see footnotes 9 and 10).  \n \n28.  The proposed Program aims to draw on lessons learned from the past difficulties in the \nimplementation of reforms as well as implementation of project interventions to supplement public \nservices.    Based  on  these  lessons,  the  Program  is  the  first  systematic  and  holistic  effort \nstructured after intensive dialogue to support fundamental long term reforms in a phased manner.  \nThe Program scope includes (i) Phase 1, an integrated package of support comprised of a \nprogram loan to support reforms that rationalize and strengthen the policy, legal and regulatory \nframework, project support to strengthen the capacities of financial management at local level, \nand TA support to strengthen the capacity of the new institutional mechanism to coordinate \ndecentralization reforms, and (ii) Phase 2, which will be steered by the NAPFD that has been \nendorsed by the Government. Details on outcome and outputs of the Program are provided \nbelow. \n \nB.  Program Loan  \n \n1.   Outcome \n \n29.  Phase 1. The policy actions supported by the single tranche program loan under Phase 1 \nof  the  Program  will  promote  greater  accountability  in  the  management  of  local  government \nfinances and will focus on five key outputs: (i) enhanced intergovernmental coordination and \ndevelopment of the NAPFD; (ii) strengthened and harmonized framework for regional autonomy; \n(iii) strengthened, rationalized, and harmonized framework for intergovernmental fiscal relations; \n(iv) strengthened and harmonized framework for planning, budgeting and financial management; \nand (v) enhanced awareness of PEFM reforms and modernization of FMIS. Through a more \nconsistent legal and regulatory framework, local governments will be able to prepare financial \ninformation and reports that comply with higher and more comparable standards of disclosure. \nTable 1 presents the outcome of Phase 1 achievements within the context of the changing \nlandscape of decentralization in Indonesia.  \n \n ", "8   \n \nTable 1: Changing Landscape of Decentralization in Indonesia \n \nKey Factor  Pre-Decentralization  Reforms Introduced in 1999  Reforms Introduced Since \n(Supported under earlier  2004 (Supported under the \nADB Initiatives)  Program) \nPolitical Structure  \u2022  President elected by  \u2022  No change in electoral  \u2022  Direct election of President, \nParliament;  Provincial  system  Provincial Governors and \nGovernors appointed    Heads of Districts \nby President, and  \u2022  New Regional \nHeads of Districts by  Representative Council \nGovernors  (DPD) established \nLevel of Authority  \u2022  Full central control in  \u2022  Deconcentration through  \u2022  Central Government \nthe form of central  provinces shifted to full  oversight through greater \nsponsorship and  devolution to districts  authority vested in provinces \nfinancing  \u2022  Review of subnational  for coordination, budget \n(deconcentration)a of  budgets required from a  evaluation, and civil service \u2013 \nfunctions exercised  legalistic point of view, but  with subnational budgets \nthrough provinces  not approval by higher  requiring formal approval by \nauthorities  higher levels \n  \u2022  Central funding through \n  deconcentration to continue, \nbut flexibility allowed in \nfinancing with plans to phase \nout such mechanisms \nSector and  \u2022  Provinces and districts  \u2022  District governments  \u2022  Both provincial and district \nFunctional  exercised national  entrusted with obligatory  governments entrusted with \nResponsibilities  policy and sector  functions in 11 broad  functions in 16 broad areas, \nmandates  sectors, while Provinces  with exact responsibilities left \n  were given broader  to be defined by further \ncoordination responsibility  regulation \n\u2022  National Government \nexercised considerable \ninfluence through \ndeconcentrated funding \nRevenue  \u2022  Local revenue  \u2022  District and provincial  \u2022  Amendments underway to \nAuthority and  authority remained  governments in charge of  specify a positive list of taxes \nFiscal Transfers  constrained  a variety of local taxes and  \u2022  Formula for revenue sharing \n\u2022  Resource allocations  charges, governed by a  improved, and share \nguided by central  negative list  increased to 26%, to be \npriorities  \u2022  Selected taxes are shared  phased in over time \nbetween national and local  \u2022  Earmarked transfers system \nlevels  strengthened allowing for \n\u2022  Substantial revenue  reallocation of \nsharing arrangements, with  deconcentrated funds \n25% of revenues shared \nthrough general purpose \ntransfers   \nFinancial  \u2022  Input-based budgeting  \u2022  Modest movement to  \u2022  Multi-year budgeting based \nManagement and  with limited financial or  performance-based  on uniform accounting and \nAccountability  performance  budgeting and enhanced  reporting standards. \naccountability  accountability by regional  Enhanced accountability to \nparliaments  Parliaments for physical and \nfinancial performance \na  Deconcentration refers to central sponsorship and financing of regional expenditure needs. \n ", "   9\n30.  Phase 2. Phase 2 of the Program is integrally linked to the Phase 1 reforms and will result \nin streamlined functional responsibilities between different levels of government and a more \nequitable framework for intergovernmental fiscal relations to ensure that funding follows functions. \nPhase 2 will build on Phase 1 reforms and be guided by national and local priorities and lessons \nlearned from Phase 1. The NAPFD sets out the Government\u2019s vision for forward-looking reforms \nunder subsequent phases of the Program.  \n \n31.  Appendix  1  presents  the  design  and  monitoring  framework  of  the  Program.  The \nGovernment\u2019s development policy letter, the policy matrix and the NAPFD as endorsed by the \nGovernment are presented in Appendices 2, 3, and 4. \n  \n2.  Outputs under Phase 1 \n \n32.  The policy matrix for Phase 1 consists of a series of specific policy actions grouped under \nthe five outputs outlined above.  \n \na.  Enhanced  Inter-Governmental  Coordination  and  Development  of  a \nNational Action Plan for Fiscal Decentralization  \n33.  Intergovernmental Coordination. One of the primary purposes of the Program is to \nimprove intergovernmental coordination at national and sub-provincial levels to provide for policy, \nlegal, and regulatory consistency on decentralization reforms. To enhance such coordination, the \nGovernment, through a presidential decree has established the Regional Autonomy Advisory \nCouncil (DPOD) under the Program. The decree provides the DPOD with enhanced coordination \nauthority and broader local government participation than the earlier Regional Autonomy Advisory \nBoard.  Its  key  role  is  to  provide  advice  to  the  President  on  regional  autonomy  policy  on \n(i) establishment,  elimination,  and  merger  of  local  governments,  (ii) assessment  of  regional \ngovernment performance, (iii) assignment of functions, and (iii) fiscal balance. DPOD is chaired \nby the Minister of Home Affairs and includes 13 other members: Minister of Finance (also serves \nas Vice Chair), Minster of Defense, Minister of Justice and Human Rights, Secretary of State, \nState  Minister  for  Administrative  Reform,  Minister  of  National  Development  Planning \n(BAPPENAS), Cabinet Secretary, three local government representatives (one governor and two \nmayors) and three experts on regional autonomy and regional finance. \n \n34.  The lack of adequate coordination, and in particular inadequate and poorly coordinated \npolicy and technical work in the area of decentralization, have been principal constraints in the \npast. It is anticipated that these weaknesses will be addressed by the establishment of DPOD, its \nbroad-based  participation,  efforts  to  coordinate  technical  work,  and  streamlined  standard \noperating  procedures,  including  quarterly  meetings  with  at  least  two  thirds  of  the  DPOD  in \nattendance. DPOD\u2019s Technical working groups on regional autonomy and fiscal balance include \nrepresentatives  from  each  DPOD  member  representing  national  government  ministries  and \nagencies, and other members to provide technical expertise as appropriate.11 The proposed TA \n                                                 \n11 Each working group is assigned specific tasks as follows (i) working group 1 - establish grand design for regional \ngovernment autonomy functional assignments, institutional, personnel, financial, representative, public service, \nregional cooperation; (ii) working group 2 - review and make recommendations for establishing, eliminating, and \nmerging local governments and setting up special area; (iii) working group 3 \u2013 make recommendations regarding \ncapacity assessment of local governments in conducting functional assignments; (iv) working group 4 - review and \nmake recommendations on assessment of local government finance capacity, calculation of revenue sharing by local  \ngovernments, and formula and calculation of DAU for local governments based on DAU ceiling; (v) working group 5 -\nreview and make recommendations on formulation of special allocation grants (DAK) policy for regional governments \non an annual basis based on the DAK ceiling; and (vi) working group 6 \u2013 monitor and evaluate policy implementation \nregarding the above areas. \n ", "10  \nwill provide initial support to DPOD, and the Government has undertaken to provide adequate \nresources to DPOD as part of its medium-term commitment under the NAPFD.  \n \n35.  National Action Plan on Fiscal Decentralization (NAPFD). The Government has taken \nthe  most  fundamental  step  of  devolving  significant  authority  to  local  governments.  Yet,  the \ncomplexity and political sensitivities of the agenda dictate the need for prudence and impartiality \nin implementation. The Government recognizes that enforcement of the legal and regulatory \nframework needs to be phased in over a number of years, with a clear roadmap. Further changes \nwill inevitably be needed in a number of laws and regulations. In order to effectively guide future \nreforms, the Government, as part of the Program, has prepared the NAPFD as a key policy \ndocument to identify key issues and problems in harmonizing the policy, legal and regulatory \nframework on fiscal decentralization. Further, the NAPFD sets out a time-bound action plan, with \na series of forward-looking reform measures to address these issues and problems over the next \n2-3 years, along with a clear delineation of inter-ministerial responsibilities. Reflecting the high-\nlevel  commitment,  as  well  as  the  improving  coordination  within  the  Government,  the  State \nMinister of Bappenas and the Ministers of MOF and MOHA have endorsed the NAPFD. The \nNAPFD will become a principal working document of the Government and guide future initiatives \nin strengthening fiscal decentralization.  The Section on Outputs under Phase 2 presents further \ndetails on the forward-looking agenda. \n \nb.  Strengthened and Harmonized Framework for Regional Autonomy  \n36.  Regional Autonomy. Over the course of 2003-04, amendments to the original Law on \nRegional Autonomy were proposed, leading to the enactment of the revised Law on Regional \nAdministration in 2004 (32/2004). ADB provided advisory support in selected areas. The revised \nlaw  strengthens  the  framework  for  regional  autonomy,  specifically  by  providing  a  greater \ncoordination role for the provinces, and by incorporating key reforms under recently adopted laws \ngoverning local government finance. The list of obligatory functions has been expanded in the \nrevised law to cover 16 broad areas and districts as well as provincial governments are entrusted \nwith service delivery responsibilities.  \n \n37.  Clarity in the allocation of functional responsibilities lies at the heart of decentralization, as \nthe framework on functional assignments in turn guides the allocation of resources between \ndifferent levels of governments. For that reason, devolution of authority is complex and sensitive \nin any economy, but particularly more so in Indonesia, given its history and diversity. Close to four \ndecades of centralized decision making has led to significant consolidation of power and capacity \nwithin the central line authorities. Any realignment of functional and financing arrangements can \nbe done only in a gradual manner. Yet, the revised Law on Regional Administration has taken a \nsignificant step forward in this direction. By providing for direct elections of heads of districts and \nprovinces, the new legal framework has the potential to align the local governments\u2019 orientation \nand public service delivery priorities closely with the local preferences. Moving forward, the \nrelative roles and authorities of provinces need to be clarified and strengthened, clearly anchored \non  sound  coordination  and  greater  transparency  and  accountability  with  regard  to  local \ngovernment fiscal and financial affairs. \n \n38.  Strengthening the Delivery of Public Services. Along with its efforts to streamline \nfunctions and financing options, the Government has also focused on the need for improving the \nquality  and  quantity  of  public  services.  As  Indonesia  implements  the  legal  provisions  on \ndevolution of authority, there is recognition that certain minimum service standards (SPM) need to \nbe established. Under the Program, the Government has adopted a new regulation to provide \nguidance  to  (i)  sector  ministries  on  formulating  SPM  for  the  obligatory  functions  of  local \ngovernments,  including  the  need  to  factor  in  fiscal  constraints  to  facilitate  a  tighter  linkage \n ", "   11\nbetween service delivery norms and resources, and (ii) local governments in implementing SPM. \nUnder the regulation, sector ministries will be required to compile SPM to clarify obligatory \nfunctions in their sector and to develop recommendations for consideration by the DPOD prior to \nfinalization.12 Ministries have 3 years in which to compile SPM, which, once adopted, will be used \nfor planning and budgeting by local governments and reflected in their medium-term development \nplans. The subsequent phases of the Program will support the development of SPM in the health, \neducation  and  public  works  sectors  (which  are  responsible  for  75%  of  local  government \nexpenditures), using the new guidelines, in close coordination with the ongoing support from \nother development partners. \n   \nc.  Strengthened, Rationalized and Harmonized Framework for \nIntergovernmental Fiscal Relations \n39.  Intergovernmental Fiscal Transfers. With the aim of promoting greater equalization in \nthe  allocation  of  resources  between  the  national  and  local  governments,  the  Program  has \nsupported the adoption of a revised Law on Fiscal Balance (33/2004). This law takes a number of \nimportant steps to enhance overall equity, while retaining the basic framework as envisioned in \nthe original 1999 legal framework for funding local government functions and responsibilities. Box \n1 summarizes the key amendments in the revised Laws on Regional Administration and Fiscal \nBalance supported under the Program. \n \n40.  To  promote  greater  transparency  and  accountability  in  the  management  of  regional \nfinance, the Program has also supported the adoption of a new regulation under the revised Law \non Fiscal Balance to clarify the framework for the SIKD.13  Under the new regulation, MOF will be \nresponsible for formulating standard information requirements; providing technical guidance on \ncollecting, processing, validating, analyzing and presenting information; preparing technical plans \nfor developing the SIKD; standardizing the system, including procedures, coding, equipment, \napplication,  and  information  exchange;  and  coordinating  the  communication  network  and \ninformation system connecting SIKD units. The project loan will support enhancement of the \nSIKD to incorporate the new legal and regulatory framework for public financial management. \n                                                 \n12 DPOD will review and reconcile financial implications of such proposals prior to submission to the President. \n13 Under the new regulation, local governments that fail to comply are subject to withholding of 10% of the DAU \nprovided monthly. The sanction will be imposed until the required information is submitted. Once this information has \nbeen submitted, the amount of DAU which has been postponed will be provided.  \n ", "12  \n \n \nBox 1: Key Provisions in the Revised Laws on  \nRegional Administration and Regional Fiscal Balance Supported Under the Program \n \nThe revised Laws on Regional Administration and Fiscal Balance contain a number of provisions aimed at \nenhancing overall operational and allocative efficiency and equity in intergovernmental relations. The key \nprovisions include: \n \n(cid:190)  Direct elections of heads of cities and districts and governors of provinces \u2013 this will eventually \nhelp bring public services closer to the public, by aligning national and local government priorities \nwith public preferences \n \n(cid:190)  Greater clarity in functional assignments \u2013 the revised Law on Regional Administration adopts a \npositive list to specify sectors and broad functions to be devolved to local governments. Yet, \ngiven the complexity and sensitivity, the revised law sets out general criteria for allocating \nfunctions, with focus on costs and benefits of implementing functions at different levels, and on \nthe principle of subsidiarity, which argues in favor of greater devolution. Although these are \nimportant changes, significant reforms will be needed in subsequent phases of the Program. \n \n(cid:190)  Greater coordination role for provinces \u2013 in contrast to the 1999 legal framework, provinces are \ngiven greater responsibility in two areas: policy and implementation coordination, and evaluation \nof local government performance. However, these legal requirements need to be enforced in a \njudicious and effective manner so as not to undermine the devolution of functional authority \nconferred on district governments. The implementation of NAPFD will help streamline reforms.      \n \n(cid:190)  Scope for allocating funding in line with functions \u2013 the revised Law on Fiscal Balance provides \nfor flexibility to allocate a greater share of funds that were hitherto of a deconcentrated nature as \nearmarked transfers (DAK). \n \n(cid:190)  Greater room for enhancing allocative efficiency and horizontal equity \u2013 the revised Law on Fiscal \nBalance achieves the following: (i) increasing, even if marginally, the general purpose grants \n(DAU) from 25% to 26% of total revenues (which, based on current data, would result in \nadditional  resources  of  about Rp.15-20  trillion  or approximately  $1.5-2  billion) by  2008;  (ii) \ngradually phasing out the previous stipulation that 10% of the overall DAU pool should be shared \nequally by all local governments; and (iii) incorporating the natural resource transfers as an \nintegral part in calculating the DAU allocation, and gradually phasing out the \u201cHold Harmless\u201d \nallocations to resource-rich regions. Notwithstanding these improvements, some key constraints \nneed to be removed, principally the linkage between wage bill and the DAU calculation, which in \nessence  does  not  give  any  flexibility  or  incentives  to  local  governments  in  civil  service \nmanagement. This is a key area addressed in the NAPFD. \n \n \n41.  Local Government Revenues. The Law on Regional Taxes and Charges enables local \ngovernments, which often lack capacity, to formulate taxes and charges that meet prescribed \ncriteria, including, among others, lack of economic distortion. The negative (open list) approach \nhas  resulted  in  the  proliferation  of  local  nuisance  taxes  and  charges  that  discourage  local \ninvestment. Under this law, local regulations (perdas) on taxes and charges are submitted to \nMOF and MOHA for review for consistency with higher laws and regulations after adoption.14 As \npart of the Program, MOF and MOHA completed a review of perdas on taxes and charges \nsubmitted from 1999 through 31 March 2005 to ensure these perdas conformed with higher laws \nand regulations. Out of 4,751 perdas on tax and charges submitted, 4,274 were reviewed and \n                                                 \n14 As discussed below, under the related project component, the revised Law on Regional Administration requires \nsubmission of draft perdas on taxes and charges to MOF and MOHA for review of consistency with higher laws and \nregulations prior to adoption.  \n ", "   13\nMOHA revoked 477. In addition, under the Program, MOF has prepared and submitted proposed \namendments to the Law on Regional Taxes and Charges to the State Secretariat with a view to \nreducing local government dependence on national government transfers and promoting more \nproductive sources of local revenue. The proposed amendments include a move to a \u201cpositive \nlist\u201d of taxes that can expand the local tax base and help address the proliferation of local \nnuisance taxes and charges.  \n  \n42.  Regional Government Borrowing: The revised Law on Fiscal Balance, supported under \nthe Program, limits combined national and local government debt to no more than 60% of GDP \nand local governments\u2019 outstanding debt to no more than 75% of their previous fiscal year\u2019s \ngeneral revenue. Under this law, borrowing by local governments is divided into three categories: \n(i) short-term borrowing for cash flow needs in a single fiscal year; (ii) medium-term borrowing to \nfinance non-revenue-generating projects for a term greater than 1 year, but less than the term of \nthe head of the region; and (iii) long-term borrowing for revenue-generating projects for terms \nexceeding 1 year. Local governments are required to obtain approval from the local parliament \nand the MOF before they issue bonds, although the national government may not guarantee \nregional  bonds.  Regional  government  borrowing  may  be  sourced  through  the  national \nGovernment,  other  local  governments,  banks  and  financial  institutions,  nonbank  financial \ninstitutions, and bond issuance. Local governments cannot borrow directly from foreign sources, \nbut may do so indirectly through on-lending of foreign funds from the national government. The \nlaw allows for the DAU allocated to local governments to be intercepted in case of default on \nrepayments to the national Government, but the national Government appears reluctant to use \nthis solution. \n   \n43.  Under the Program, the Government has adopted a revised regulatory framework to \ngovern  local  government  borrowing.  Further,  to  help  resolve  the  debt  arrears  of  local \ngovernments  and  regional  government-owned  water  enterprises  (PDAMs),  the  Program  has \nsupported the (i) adoption of a regulation that provides a framework for addressing government \nreceivables,  including  local  government  and  PDAM  debt  arrears;  (ii)  adoption  of  a  related \nministerial  decree  that  provides  procedures  for  restructuring  of  PDAM  debt  arrears;  (iii) \nidentification of local government and PDAM loan portfolio status for RDA loans pursuant to \nsubsidiary loan agreements as of 31 December 2004, including the extent of arrears; and (iv) \ninitiation by MOF of debt workout agreements with seven local governments and/or PDAMs with \narrears.  These reforms will help to resolve a key constraint to local government and PDAM \nborrowing and therefore to fund much needed development.  \n \nd.  Strengthened and Harmonized Framework for Planning, Budgeting \nand Financial Management \n44.  National level framework type of laws on planning, budgeting and financial management \nact as the foundation for sound local government finance and governance. As the key aim of the \nProgram is to harmonize laws and regulations pertaining to local governments with those of the \nnational  laws,  the  Program  also  supports  the  implementation  of  the  new  Law  on  National \nDevelopment Planning System (25/2004) to promote an integrated and coordinated approach to \nlonger-term development planning by national and local governments. In particular, under the \nProgram,  the  Government  has  approved  key  implementing  regulations  on  planning  and \nbudgeting, aimed at enhancing performance orientation in the public sector. \n \n45.  Another key legislation supported under the Program is the new Law on State Treasury \n(1/2004), which aims to strengthen the legal framework for budget execution, assets and liabilities \nmanagement, and accounting. As a follow-up to this law, under the Program, the Government \nhas  adopted  a  Presidential  Decree  establishing  the  Committee  on  Government  Accounting \n ", "14  \nStandards  (Komite  Standar  Akuntansi  Pemerintah  Pusat  Dan  Daerah,  KSAP).  It  has  also \napproved a regulation which outlines the Conceptual Framework for Government Accounting and \nthe Statement on Government Accounting Standards (PSAP) 1-11 on a modified accrual basis \nand a classification framework that is generally in line with the Government Finance Statistics \nManual (GFSM) 2001. \n \n46.  The  revised  Law  on  Regional  Administration  sets  out  legal  provisions  on  budget \npreparation, approval, execution, and evaluation at the local level. Under this law, provincial \nbudgets are required to be evaluated and approved by MOHA before implementation, while \ndistrict budgets have to be evaluated and approved by the provinces. All local governments are \nrequired  to  develop  a  regional  financial  management  information  system  (SIPKD)  as  an \nintegrated part of the SIKD. The financial transactions of local governments need to follow the \nbudget and pass through a single treasury account at the regional level. Local governments are \nrequired to submit an annual report on budget execution to the local parliament. \n \n47.  Under the Program, the Government has also amended the earlier Government regulation \non regional financial management (105/2000), and adopted an action plan to implement this new \nregulation. The close coordination between MOHA and MOF in drafting this new regulation is \nnoteworthy,  as  it  represents  a  significant  step  toward  a  more  coordinated  and  consistent \nregulatory framework for public financial management. Under the action plan, MOHA will work \nclosely with MOF in drafting revisions to a related MOHA Decree (29/2000) and a template for a \nperda on regional financial management. The end result of this successful collaboration will be a \nunified set of implementing regulations on public financial management that will need to be \neffectively disseminated to local governments. \n \ne.  Enhanced Awareness of Public Expenditure and Financial \nManagement Reforms and Modernization of Financial Management \nInformation Systems \n48.  The revised Law on Regional Administration confers greater coordination responsibilities \non the national and provincial governments, while retaining the spirit of devolution of authority to \nthe district governments. Among other functions, local government heads, in coordination with \nlocal parliaments, develop local budgets and are responsible for local financial management, \nincluding supervision of budget execution and accountability. Provincial governors, while locally \nelected, represent the national government and report directly to the President. The revised law \nprovides for provincial budgets to be evaluated and approved by MOHA, which has veto authority \nin  case  of  disputes,  and  for  district  budgets  to  be  evaluated  and  approved  by  provincial \ngovernors, who also have veto authority in their capacity as representatives of the national \ngovernment. \n \n49.  In an effort to rationalize oversight responsibilities between MOF and MOHA and to \noversee  and  coordinate  activities  related  to  regional  financial  management,  in  2003,  a \nPresidential Decree (8/2003) was issued to establish a new Directorate General (DG) of Regional \nFinancial Management (BAKD) within MOHA.  In 2004, a director general was appointed, a \ngeneral structure and staffing approved, and echelon 2 and 3 appointees assumed office. In line \nwith the revised Law on Regional Administration, DG BAKD needs to modernize its information \nsystems so it can evaluate budgeting and financial management practices more effectively, as \nwell  as  outcomes  at  the  local  government  level.  In  addition,  as  recent  amendments  have \nconferred greater oversight authority on provincial governors with regard to local government \nbudgets, DG BAKD needs to ensure that provincial FMIS are enhanced. New Laws on State \nFinance, State Treasury, State Audit (15/2004), and National Development Planning System also \nrequire local governments to upgrade planning, accounting, financial management, and internal \n ", "   15\naudit. However, few local government officials are equipped to exercise the demanding and \ncomplex responsibilities they now face in providing local services with limited resources.  \n \n50.   At the national level, DG BAKD in MOHA is required to evaluate provincial budgets and \nestablish the evaluation norms to be adopted by provinces when they review district budgets. In \ndoing  so,  MOHA  needs  to  coordinate  with  MOF  on  the  regulatory  requirements  that  local \ngovernments need to adopt in line with the new Laws on State Finance and State Treasury.  \nUnder the Program, MOHA has prepared and adopted a plan, including a full technical proposal \nand costing, for a computerized FMIS to automate processes for the receipt and policy and \nregulatory evaluation of financial and performance data submitted by local governments.15   \n \n51.   Under the Program, MOHA has also developed and adopted a plan for the SIPKD to be \nimplemented in 71 local governments (12 provinces and 59 districts in four of these provinces, \nchosen by MOHA). The plan, backed by technical proposals and costing, was developed in close \ncoordination  with  ADB,  and  local  governments  were  selected  according  to  objective  criteria \nagreed  upon  with  ADB,  including  their  fiscal  and  financial  management  capacities.  The  12 \nprovinces are: West Sumatra, Lampung, West Java, Yogyakarta, East Java, East Kalimantan, \nSouth Sulawesi, Bali, North Maluku, Gorontolo, North Sumatra, and Central Java. MOHA agreed \nto cluster the participating districts in West Java, West Sumatra, Yogyakarta and Lampung. At a \nseries of workshops funded under related ADB technical assistance,16 prior to adoption, the draft \nplan was discussed with the 71 local governments and the heads of these local governments \nsubsequently entered into an agreement with MOHA to promote full transparency, implement \nPEFM reforms, and participate in the project. \n \n      3.     Forward Looking Program (Phase 2) \n \n52.   The decentralization reform agenda is an area where successive Governments have \nundertaken  stock-taking  type  of  assessments  and  shown  clear  commitment  for  continuous \nreforms. This applies particularly to the present Government, headed by the first directly elected \nhead of State. The Government\u2019s strong commitment to a coherent and well sequenced strategy \nfor decentralization was most recently expressed by the President of Indonesia during an address \nto the Regional Representative Council.17 In this speech, the President highlighted the need to (i) \nadopt reforms in a more systematic and coordinated manner; (ii) increase regional fiscal capacity \nand  promote  greater  intergovernmental  fiscal  balance,  including  reallocating  part  of  the \ndeconcentration fund through special allocation grants (DAK) to finance local activities that have \nbeen decentralized;  (iii) widen the base for regional taxes and charges; (iv) implement financial \nmanagement reforms, including enhanced capacity at the local level; and (v) promote enhanced \naccountability. \n \n53.   The NAPFD adopted under the Program marks a significant step in adopting a clear and \ntime-bound forward-looking plan on the fiscal aspects of decentralization. The Government, as \noutlined in the Development Policy Letter, has committed to continuously refine the NAPFD and \nto use it as a basis for formulating Phase 2 and subsequent phases of the Program. Box 2 \npresents the key elements of the forward-looking reform agenda supported under the Program. \n \n \n                                                 \n15 Support to DG BAKD will be provided under the project loan to implement the related FMIS plan.  \n16 ADB. 2003. Technical Assistance to the Republic of Indonesia for Local Government Financing. Manila (TA 4282, for \n$600,000).  \n17 Government  Statement  on  Regional  Development  Policy  before  the  Plenary  Session  of  the  Regional \nRepresentatives Council, Republic of Indonesia. 23 August 2005.  \n ", "16  \n \nBox 2: Key Elements of Subsequent Phases of the Program \nOutline of the National Action Plan on Fiscal Decentralization \n \nThe National Action Plan on Fiscal Decentralization (NAPFD) sets out the forward-looking plan of the \nGovernment, to guide Phase 2 and subsequent Phases of the Program. It focuses on the following \noutputs: \n \n(cid:190)  Streamlining  Functional  Assignments,  and  Enhancing  Alignment  between  Functions  and \nFinancing \n(cid:190)  Enhancing Public Service Delivery \n(cid:190)  Strengthening  Regional  Resource  Base,  including  measures  to  enhance  local  revenues, \nstreamline revenue sharing, and equalize resource transfers \n(cid:190)  Strengthening Regional Financial Management \n(cid:190)  Evolving a Sound and Impartial Coordination Mechanism for Formulation and Implementation of \nDecentralization Reforms. \n \nThe NAPFD and the subsequent phases of the Program will support a number of specific actions. Among \nothers, the indicative actions include: \n \n\u2022  Clear assignment of obligatory and sub-functions at the national, provincial and district and or city  \nlevels, with specific focus on education, health and public works sectors which account for over \n75% of public expenditures \n\u2022  Elimination of inconsistencies between the regional autonomy laws and regulations and relevant \nsector laws \n\u2022  Adoption of clear policy mandates and priorities in education, health and public works sectors, to \nclearly guide local level implementation of national priorities, as a prelude to the finalization of \nminimum service standards (SPM) in those sectors \n\u2022  Design and submission to the President of clear policy options to reform the inter-governmental \nfiscal framework \n\u2022  Implementation of regulatory and procedural reforms aimed at achieving horizontal and vertical \nequity in a gradual manner, based on continuous reviews of the fiscal balance situation supported \nby a sound simulation model \n\u2022  Transfer of central authority and funding through special purpose grants (DAK), to provide for \nfurther devolution accompanied by full transparency and accountability \n\u2022  Adoption of, and adherence to, a clear policy on the use of intercept mechanisms to deal with \noutstanding local government debt arrears \n\u2022  Regulatory reforms to provide for local government borrowing from market sources, with clear \nplans for contingent liability management at local, provincial and national levels \n\u2022  Regulatory  measures  to  deal  with  bankruptcy  of  local  governments  and  local  government \ninstitutions \n\u2022  Regulatory  reforms  and  capacity  development  measures  instituted  to  strengthen  regional \nfinancial management, including effective management of local government assets \n\u2022  Enhancing local government transparency and accountability through effective enforcement of \nsanctions for failure to report financial information on a timely basis to higher authorities  \n\u2022  Policy  and  regulatory  reforms  to  provide  local  governments  with  flexibility  in  civil  service \nadministration \n\u2022  Continuous  strengthening  and  empowerment  of  the  Regional  Autonomy  Advisory  Council \n(DPOD) to function as an effective coordination mechanism to formulate and implement forward \nlooking decentralization reforms \n     \n  4.  Important Features \n \n54.  The Program has five important features that build on ADB\u2019s key role in supporting \ndecentralization and good governance in aid of poverty reduction. First, it will support a series of \n ", "   17\nreforms to which the Government has demonstrated clear and sustained commitment since 1998. \nSecond, it builds on a significant body of prior work by ADB and other development partners \n(Appendix 11) and it links with on-going projects, including ADB\u2019s STAR and SCBD projects \n(Footnotes  9  and  10)  to  provide  an  integrated  package  of  support.  Third,  it  demonstrates \nconsiderable development partner cooperation. Fourth, program activities will have a positive \nimpact on the effectiveness of ADB lending in decentralized sectors, particularly with regard to \non-lending to local governments. Fifth, the Program has been designed to sequence medium-\nterm  reforms,  taking  into  account  varying  implementation  capabilities  at  national  and  local \ngovernment levels.  \n \n  5.  Financing Plan \n \n55.  For Phase 1, it is proposed that ADB provide to the Republic of Indonesia a loan of \n$300 million from its ordinary capital resources with a 15-year term, including a grace period of 3 \nyears, an interest rate to be determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate \n(LIBOR)\u2013based lending facility, including a commitment charge of 0.75% per annum, and such \nother terms and conditions as set forth in the Program Loan Agreement. \n \n56.  The ADB funds will support reforms that address complex and fundamental issues as \ndescribed in the development policy letter and policy matrix (Appendixes 2 and 3). The loan size \nhas  been  determined  by  the  complexity  of  the  Program,  its  development  impact,  and  the \nimportance of the sector.  \n \n6.  Implementation Arrangements \n \na.  Program Management \n \n57.  MOF  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  (EA).  MOF,  MOHA,  and  Bappenas  will  be  the \nImplementing Agencies (IA). The DPOD will help coordinate policy, legal and regulatory reforms. \nBased on diagnostic work undertaken by ADB and the World Bank under a joint country financial \naccountability assessment (21 April 2001), implementation of related reforms identified under this \nassessment including adoption of a new legal and regulatory framework for public financial \nmanagement, including reforms under the Program, and related reorganization of MOF and \nMOHA,  financial management arrangements under the Program are considered satisfactory to \nensure  that  the  Government  will  fund  implementation  of  the  Program  and  other  activities \nconsistent with Program objectives.  \n \n    b.  Implementation Period \n \n58.  The reforms supported  under Phase 1 of the Program cover the period from 1 January \n2004 to 31 December 2006.   \n \nc.  Procurement and Disbursement  \n \n59.  The loan proceeds will be used to finance the full foreign exchange costs (excluding local \nduties and taxes) of items produced and procured in ADB member countries, excluding ineligible \nitems  (Appendix  12)  and  imports  financed  by  other  bilateral  and  multilateral  sources.  In \naccordance with the provisions of ADB\u2019s Simplification of Disbursement Procedures and Related \nRequirements for Program Loans, the proceeds of the program loan will be disbursed to the \nRepublic of Indonesia as the Borrower. No supporting import documentation will be required, if \nduring each year that loan proceeds are expected to be disbursed, the value of Indonesia\u2019s total \nimports minus imports from nonmember countries, ineligible imports, and imports financed under \n ", "18  \nother official development assistance is equal to or greater than the amount of the loan expected \nto be disbursed during such year. The Government will certify its compliance with this formula \nwith each withdrawal request. Otherwise, import documentation under existing procedures will be \nrequired. Disbursements will be made under the simplified procedures for program loans.  \n \nd.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n \n60.  ADB retains the right to audit the use of loan proceeds and to verify the accuracy of the \nGovernment\u2019s certification for each withdrawal application. Prior to withdrawal, the Government \nwill open a deposit account at Bank Indonesia to receive all loan proceeds. The account will be \nmanaged, operated and liquidated in accordance with terms satisfactory to ADB. The MOF will \nsend quarterly progress reports to ADB on the policy reform measures. The project loan will \nsupport the establishment and maintenance of sound financial management arrangements to \nsupport program and project implementation.  \n \ne.  Single Tranche \n \n61.  The program loan of $300 million will be released in a single tranche effective upon \nfulfillment  of  Phase  1  conditions.  The  single  tranche  approach  for  Phase  1  is  justified  by: \n(i) substantive compliance with 20 key policy actions, which institute fundamental reforms in local \ngovernment finance and governance; (ii) the evolving nature of Phase 2 based on the uncertain \nmacroeconomic and political environment and emerging developments and requirements; and (iii) \ncomplexities and strong vested interests involved in implementing fiscal decentralization, which \nrequires more time to ensure stronger support and consensus. Through the NAPFD, ADB and the \nGovernment have agreed on the agenda for Phase 2 dialogue and design. The timing for ADB\u2019s \nconsideration of Phase 2 will be decided during the course of 2006, upon a thorough assessment \nof the reform outcomes and the results of additional sector work being supported by ADB. \n \nf.  Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n \n62.  The poverty impact of the Program will be monitored and evaluated through existing \nmechanisms for monitoring regional disparities and achievement of the Millennium Development \nGoals.  \n \ng.  Program Review \n \n63.  The Government and ADB will conduct a comprehensive review after 12 months and \ninterim reviews every 6 months to evaluate the progress of reform measures, including the pace \nand direction of indicative reform actions set forth in the NAPFD and their impact on local \ngovernment finance and governance.  \n \nC.  Project Loan  \n \n1.   Components and Outputs \n \n64.  The policy actions and project support of the Program are integrally linked. Both strive to \npromote greater accountability for local government finances, which will in turn lead to more \nefficient use of public resources and more effective delivery of basic public services at the local \nlevel.  The  project  consists  of  five  components,  all  of  which  have  been  discussed  above: \n(i) upgrade and expand SIKD; (ii) computerization of DG BAKD to enhance oversight of PEFM \nreforms; (iii) develop and implement the SIPKD; (iv) computerization of the MOF system for \n ", "   19\nreview  of  perda  and  draft  perdas  on  taxes  and  charges;  and  (v) development  of  an  MOF \ncertification program for regional financial administrators.  \n \n  a.     Upgrade and Expand SIKD \n \n65.  The original and revised Law on Fiscal Balance and implementing regulations require \nMOF to set up and manage the SIKD. Over the past 2 years, the World Bank (through the Dutch \nTrust  Fund)  has  supported  development  of  the  SIKD  through  a  pilot  scheme  in  19  local \ngovernments.  The  pilot  program  involves  trials  of  automated  approaches  to  collecting, \nconsolidating,  and  analyzing  local  government  financial  information  and  provides  budget \npreparation functionality. The current pilot program is not an accounting system, but rather aims \nto integrate with, and collect information produced by, accounting systems. The pilot scheme is in \nthe early phases of development. One early lesson is that a budget preparation module is not \nsufficient for the introduction of standard budgeting and reporting classifications.  \n \n66.  Recent legal and regulatory reforms in public financial management enable MOF and \nMOHA to apply a consistent approach to the collection and analysis of information under the \nSIKD.18 The new approach will require significant upgrading of the charts of accounts, budget \npreparation and presentation classifications, reporting, and other financial information by local \ngovernments.  To  ensure  effective  and  consistent  reporting  that  can  easily  be  consolidated \nnationally,  and  close  integration  of  the  budget  preparation,  budget  execution  and  reporting \nprocess, the project loan will introduce enhancements to the SIKD.     \n \n67.  Outputs and Activities  The component will support the upgrading of SIKD to (i) meet \nthe requirements of the revised legal and regulatory framework for public financial management \nand (ii) meet specific MOHA, MOF and local government needs for improved financial reporting \nand accountability..19  \n \n68.  The  main  activities  will  include:  (i)  conducting  initial  field  assessments  of  local \ngovernments:  (ii)  selecting  participating  provinces  and  districts:  (iii)  reviewing  and  updating \nsystem design; (iv) preparing procurement documents; (v) procuring hardware and software; \n(vi) recruiting consultants; (vii) developing, installing and testing of the system; and (viii) providing \nmaintenance, user training, and after sales service. \n \n69.  The selection of participating provinces and districts will be in line with criteria agreed with \nADB, including: (i) commitment and willingness to participate; (ii) quality and timeliness of SIKD \ninformation submitted in the past; and (iii) the potential for complementarities with projects carried \nout by ADB and other development partners, such as ADB\u2019s STAR and SCBD projects (see \nfootnotes 10 and 11). The plan is to extend SIKD coverage to all provincial offices currently \nwithout  access  to  modern  SIKD  (around  20  provinces  after  allowing  for  the  12  provinces \nparticipating in the SIPKD component) and several pilot districts within each of the new provinces \nto be covered.  \n                                                 \n18 For some years there were conflicting views on whether SIKD requirements should be based on international \naccounting standards or requirements contained in the Government regulation and related MOHA Decree on \nregional financial management. This debate arose in part because of a lack of clarity in government accounting \nstandards.  \n19  Under this component, SIKD will be extended to an additional 100 local governments. Under the SIPKD component, \nan additional 71 local governments will be provided with SIPKD that will enable full compatibility with SIKD needs. \nThus under these two components, electronic access to the upgraded SIKD will be available to an additional 171 \nlocal governments. \n ", "20  \nb.   Computerization  of  DG  BAKD  to  Enhance  Oversight  of  PEFM \nReforms \n \n70.  Within MOHA, DG BAKD is responsible for oversight of PEFM reforms. In addition to \nperforming  supervision  and  control  functions,  DG  BAKD  is  responsible  for  facilitating  the \nstrengthening of regional government financial management. DG BAKD is also responsible for \ndrafting MOHA\u2019s recommendations to MOF in relation to the allocation of budget resources to \nlocal governments each year. DG BAKD has been operational for about 18 months and has a \ncomplement of about 170 staff members spread over four directorates and one secretariat. Given \nthe high priority accorded to provincial and local government financial matters in the decentralized \nIndonesian context, DG BAKD is potentially one of the most important directorates general in the \nIndonesian Government. \n     \n71.  The  new  legal  and  regulatory  framework  requires  that  provincial  budget  formulation \nevaluations be completed and opinions provided within 15 days from receipt of draft provincial \nbudgets. This time frame is difficult because of DG BAKD\u2019s limited financial evaluation systems, \nwhich need to be upgraded.  DG BAKD also needs to adopt a human resource development plan \nto  improve  recruitment,  training  and  development  of  staff.  The  project  loan  will  focus  on \ndeveloping and maintaining computerized information systems within DG BAKD. Broader aspects \nof human capacity development will be pursued using direct government budget funding and \ngrant support from other development partners.  \n \n72.  Outputs  and  Activities:  The  project  loan  will  provide  information  technology  and \ninformation  systems  infrastructure  within  DG  BAKD  to  improve  the  efficiency  of  internal \noperations and speed up flows of financial information to and from local governments (including \nthrough direct access to the upgraded SIKD). The outputs will include: (i) development of a \ncomprehensive information technology and information systems infrastructure within DG BAKD, \nconsisting  of  a  local  area  network,  website,  servers,  workstations,  database  management \nsystems, electronic mail, internet gateways, and office automation software, including adequate \nfacilities  to  ensure  smooth  communications  with  local  governments;  (ii)  development  of  a \ncomputerized fiscal database and analytical financial and economic models within DG BAKD, \ndrawing data directly from links to the SIKD, and eventually using direct data transfers to and \nfrom local governments; and (iii) completion of comprehensive short- and medium-term training \nprograms for all DG BAKD staff to support effective migration from the current largely manual \nsystems to the new information technology and information systems components.  \n \n73.  The main activities will include: (i) updating and confirming systems design; (ii) procuring \nhardware and software; (iii) recruiting consultants; (iv) developing, installing, and testing the \nsystem; and (v) providing maintenance and user training. System manuals and training will be \nprovided to DG BAKD staff on: (i) local area networks and operating systems management and \noperations  training;  (ii)  desktop  applications;  (iii)  financial  management  database;  and \n(iv) financial and economic evaluation models. \n \n  c.  Develop and Implement SIPKD \n \n74.  The  revised  Laws  on  Regional  Administration  and  Fiscal  Balance  require  local \ngovernments to manage and account for their finances efficiently and accurately through the \ngradual establishment of a SIPKD. Under these laws (i) SIPKD should be consistent with the new \nand emerging laws and implementing regulations on regional financial management procedures; \n(ii) budgets, accounts and reports generated by local governments should be in accord with \ngovernment accounting standards and, at a minimum, be capable of producing the financial \nreports  required  by  these  new  laws  and  implementing  regulations;  (iii)  information  collected \n ", "   21\nshould be available to the local parliaments and the public; and (iv) information generated by local \ngovernments should be submitted to both MOF and MOHA in a format to be established by them. \n \n75.  Outputs and Activities: Under the revised Law on Regional Administration, MOHA is \nresponsible for helping local governments to modernize their planning, budgeting and reporting \narrangements and for making them more transparent and accountable. Under this component \nMOHA  will  provide  SIPKD-enhanced  software,  hardware,  and  systems  to  participating  local \ngovernments.  It will also ensure SIKD system and output compatibility by coordinating closely \nwith project implementation. Other key outputs will include: (i) development and/or upgrading of \nsoftware and systems to meet the requirements of the revised regulatory framework, particularly  \nthe revised Government regulation on regional financial management and related MOHA decree; \n(ii) enhanced capability of staff to manage the migration from the existing mix of manual and \nbasic computerized financial models to a comprehensive computerized SIPKD that approaches \ninternational best practice, and ensuring proper implementation thereof; (iii) a well developed \nscheme for training and certification of the financial management and evaluation officials (at both \nregional and head office levels) to help  implement the new information systems environment \nbeing  developed;  and  (iv)  a  comprehensive  review  of  business  processes  of  regional \ngovernment-owned enterprises (BUMDs) with a view to eventually enabling BUMDs to submit \nfinancial information electronically to their local  government owners and to support efforts to \nimprove corporate planning and financial management arrangements in BUMDs.      \n \n76.  The  main  activities  will  include:  (i)  finalizing  field  assessments  of  participating  local \ngovernments;20 (ii) confirming local governments\u2019 participation; (iii) preparing manuals and other \nmaterials before the SIPKD design is finalized and setting out migration paths from existing \napproaches to those required by the new regulation; (iv) conducting a final review of the SIPKD \ndesign; (v) preparing SIPKD procurement documents; (vi) recruiting consultants; (vii) developing, \ntesting  and  implementing  SIPKD;  (viii)  procuring  hardware  and  off-the-shelf  software; \n(ix) providing maintenance and user training on SIPKD; (x) developing training and certification of \nfinancial management and financial evaluation officials of DG BAKD in both national and local \ngovernments; and (xi) undertaking a study on financial management arrangements at BUMDs.   \n \nd.   Establish a Review System for Perdas and/or Draft Perdas within MOF  \n \n77.  The revised Laws on Regional Administration and Fiscal Balance, and the soon to be \nrevised Law on Regional Taxes and Charges and related Government Regulations (65/2001 and \n66/2001) require local governments to submit perdas on taxes and charges to MOF and MOHA \nfor review and evaluation to ensure that they are consistent with higher laws and regulations. \nUnder this law, any new tax or charge must be approved by the local parliament and any draft \nperdas creating a new tax must be discussed and explained to local citizens before they can be \nadopted into law.21  \n \n78.  The legal and regulatory requirements impose tight time limits on national review. The \nLaw on Regional Taxes and Charges requires that perdas on taxes and charges be submitted to \n                                                 \n20 The 12 participating provinces are West Sumatra, Lampung, West Java, Yogyakarta, East Java, East Kalimantan, \nSouth Sulawesi, Bali, North Maluku, Gorontolo, North Sumatra, and Central Java. The 59 participating districts are \nlocated in West Java, West Sumatra, Yogyakarta and Lampung. \n21 Under the Law on Regional Taxes and Charges, tax perdas are required to fulfill the following conditions: (i) the tax \nobjects are located in the particular district and possess relatively low mobility across district boundaries; (ii) the tax \ndoes not contradict the public interest; (iii) the tax does not constitute a national or provincial tax; (iv) the tax has \nsufficient  revenue  potential;  (v) implementation  of  the  tax  will  not  negatively  impact  the  local  economy;  (vi) \ndevelopment of the tax takes into consideration issues of fairness and the capacity of local residents; and (vii) the tax \ndoes not undermine environmental conservation. \n ", "22  \nMOF and MOHA within 15 days after adoption by the local parliament and that if the national \ngovernment  has  not  raised  an  objection  within  30  days  of  submission,  the  perda  shall  be \nregarded as automatically approved.  Informally, a joint MOF and MOHA working group meets \nregularly to discuss and make preliminary evaluations of perdas on tax and charges received. \nMOF conducts the initial review and recommends revisions or rejection to MOHA. Based on \nMOF\u2019s recommendations, MOHA may cancel the perda or recommend that the local government \nrevise it but it must do so within 30 days of the local government\u2019s submission. Existing manual \nprocessing arrangements severely limit the ability of MOF and MOHA to evaluate the many \nproposed perdas within the mandated time frame. About 1,000 new perdas are received each \nyear. Usually there is a very large backlog and very few are evaluated within 30 days. In addition, \nthe revised Law on Regional Administration requires local governments to submit draft perdas on \ntaxes and charges to MOF and MOHA. Timely review of such drafts to ensure consistency with \nhigher laws prior to adoption will help address the proliferation of nuisance tax issue.  \n   \n79.  Outputs and Activities: The component will establish a workflow management system to \nstreamline the perda evaluation process. The outputs will include: (i) conversion of all existing \nperda  documents  to  electronic  documents;  (ii)  electronic  capture,  acknowledgment,  and \nmaintenance of all perda information, including information on draft perdas submitted to MOF; \n(iii) electronic monitoring of deadline dates by which evaluations need to be completed according \nto  laws  and  regulations;  (iv)  electronic  capture  of  any  additional  information  required  to  be \nsubmitted with perdas and draft perdas on taxes and charges; (v) a more efficient review and \nevaluation  process;  (vi) electronic  capture  and  recording  of  every  stage  of  the  review  and \nevaluation process; (vii) capacity to provide information on perdas on taxes and charges in both \nhard and soft copy form; (viii) generation of regular routine and customized management reports \nof perdas and/or draft perdas on taxes and charges, including local government compliance and \nconsistency with higher laws and regulations;(ix) access to information on new taxes and charges \nimposed by local governments; (x) access to successful examples of new taxes and charges, and \nto criteria used in the review process; (xi) full access to up-to-date perda  on taxes and charges \ndata  by  the  public  and  other  government  agencies;  (xii)  progress  towards  online  electronic \ntransmission, with the eventual aim of enabling all local governments to submit proposed perda \non taxes and charges electronically; and (xiii) a system design that can be replicated and linked \nwith other systems at MOHA.  \n \n80.  The main activities will include: (i) updating and confirming system design; (ii) recruiting \nconsultants;  (iii)  training  MOF  staff  and  conducting  an  organizational  review;  (iv)  procuring \nhardware  and  off-the-shelf  software;  (v)  developing  and  testing  the system;  (vi)  piloting  the \nsystem; (vii) providing maintenance manuals and training; (viii) rolling out the system to MOF and \nlocal  governments;  and  (ix)  making  the  system  accessible  to  other  government  agencies, \nincluding MOHA.  \n \ne.   Certification by MOF of Regional Financial Administrators. \n \n81.  The  new  Law  on  State  Treasury  requires  MOF  to  create  new  positions  for  local \ngovernment financial administrators to implement reforms related to budget execution, asset and \nliability management, and accounting. MOF has asked for support to clarify the skills needed for \nthese positions and to develop a related training and certification program.  \n \n82.  Outputs and Activities: The component will establish a framework for certifying regional \nfinancial administrators in coordination with MOHA. The outputs will include: (i) clarification of \nskills needed and development of qualification criteria; (ii) development of a certification and \ntraining program for candidates seeking to qualify for these positions; and (iii) development of \ntraining  programs  leading  to  certification  for  successful  candidates.  The  main  activities  will \n ", "   23\ninclude: (i) recruiting consultants; (ii) studying the certification system needed, based on similar \nsystems in other government institutions and professional bodies; (ii) designing the certification \nsystem, including preparing draft regulations to establish the system; (iii) developing training \nprograms, including training manuals; (iv) training MOF staff; and (v) compiling a database of \ncertified officials. \n \n3.    Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n \n83.  The project cost is estimated at $42.9 million equivalent, consisting of $19.4 million (45%) \nin  foreign  exchange  and  $23.4  million  equivalent  (55%)  in  local  currency  cost.

The ADB loan \nwill have an amortization period of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years, a 1.0% interest \ncharge during this grace period and 1.5% during the amortization period, and equal amortization, \nand such other terms and conditions set forth in the Project Loan Agreement.  \n \n3.  Implementation Arrangements  \n \na.  Project Coordination \n \n84.  The EA for the Project will be MOHA. MOHA and MOF will be the implementing agencies \nfor  this  Project.  A program  and  project steering  committee  (PPSC)  consisting of  echelon 1 \nofficials from MOHA,  MOF  and BAPPENAS will be established to provide overall coordination of \nboth loans. There will be one project coordinating unit (PCU) based in MOHA to assist with \nimplementation. The PCU will provide support to (i) prepare the inception phase of the project; \n(ii) coordinate  subsequent  project  implementation;  and  (iii)  assist  MOF,  MOHA,  local \ngovernments, and regional coordination committees to implement the Project. Where the Project \ninvolves local governments, regional coordination committees will be established to facilitate \nimplementation.  These  committees  will  consist  of  senior  representatives  of  (i)  the  regional \nsecretariat, (ii) local government finance bureau, (iii) local government legal bureau, (iv) local \ngovernment planning agency, and (v) one major sectoral agency within the local government \n(health or education). \n \nb.  Procurement \n \n85.  Procurement of goods and services will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for \nProcurement. Equipment will be procured through international competitive bidding procedures \nfor packages exceeding $1,000,000 equivalent and through international shopping procedures or \nlocal  competitive  bidding  procedures  acceptable  to  ADB  for  packages  up  to  and  including \n$1,000,000 equivalent. For packages of $100,000 equivalent of less, direct purchase may be \nused.  For  all  ADB-financed  goods  and  services  to  be  procured  under  the  Project,  ADB  or \nauthorized consultants will undertake periodic reviews to ensure that the procurement is being \ncarried  out  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  guidelines  and  procedures.  Indicative  procurement \npackages are set forth in Appendix 8. \n \n ", "   25\nc.   Consulting Services \n \n86.  Consultants  to  be  financed  from  the  proceeds  of  the  ADB  loan  will  be  recruited  in \naccordance  with  ADB's  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other  arrangements \nsatisfactory to ADB for engaging domestic consultants. Where firms are to be engaged, the \nquality- and cost-based selection method will be used. Approximately 3,266 person-months of \nconsulting services will be required, consisting of 3,242 person-months of domestic consulting \nservices and 24 person-months of international consulting services (outline terms of reference are \nincluded in a Supplementary Appendix). \n \nd.  Implementation Period \n \n87.  The Project will be implemented over a 36-month period. Implementation is planned to \ncommence in 2005 with recruitment of consultants for project coordination in MOF and MOHA. \n \ne.   Disbursement Arrangements \n \n88.  Disbursement procedures will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook \n(January 2001) and detailed arrangements agreed upon by the Government and ADB. The \nminimum withdrawal amount will be $100,000 equivalent.  Any disbursement below that amount \nwill be made through the imprest account or reimbursement procedures. To facilitate the timely \nrelease of loan funds, an imprest account will be established to finance eligible expenditures.  \nThe imprest account will be used solely for project purposes and will be established at the Bank \nof Indonesia. The ceiling of the imprest account will be the lesser of estimated expenditures for \nthe next 6 months, or 10% of total loan proceeds.  ADB\u2019s statement of expenditure (SOE) \nprocedure will be used to reimburse eligible expenditures and to liquidate advances to the imprest \naccount. The individual payments that may be reimbursed or liquidated under the SOE procedure \nwill not exceed $100,000 equivalent per payment.  \n \nf.   Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n \n89.  MOF  and  MOHA  will  ensure  the maintenance  of  a  sound  and  solid  accounting  and \nfinancial reporting system to account for project activities. Separate accounting records for the \nProject  will  be  maintained  by  each  implementing  agency.  Independent  auditors,  whose \nqualifications, experience and terms of reference are acceptable to ADB, will audit such accounts \nand related financial statements annually, in accordance with the provisions of the Project Loan \nAgreement. The auditor\u2019s opinion should include the imprest account, SOE, utilization of loan \nproceeds, and compliance with loan covenants and the financial covenants of the Project Loan \nAgreement. Certified copies of audited financial statements, and the auditor\u2019s observations on \ncompliance with the financial loan covenants will be submitted to ADB within 6 months of the \nclose of each fiscal year. All reports and statements will be submitted in English.  \n \n90.  A  reporting  system  will  be  established  to  report  financial  and  operational  activities. \nQuarterly  reports  will  indicate,  among  other  things,  commitments  and  disbursements, \nimplementation  status  of  approved  subprojects,  progress  made  against  established  targets, \nproblems encountered during the quarter, steps taken and proposed to resolve the problems, \ncompliance with loan covenants, and proposed project activities to be undertaken during the \nfollowing quarter. MOHA will submit quarterly consolidated reports to ADB within 20 days from \nthe end of each quarter using formats detailed in the project administration manual. All reports will \nbe in English.  \n \n ", "26  \ng.  Project Review \n \n91.  ADB and the Government will undertake joint semiannual reviews of the Project to assess \nprogress  and  identify  constraints.  The  review  will  cover  the  status  of  preparation  and \nimplementation, the performance of consultants, and the possible reallocation of loan proceeds. \nThere will be a comprehensive midterm review of the Project, after one and a half year\u2019s of  \nimplementation.  The  midterm  review  will  (i)  review  the  scope,  design,  and  implementation \narrangements of the Project; (ii) identify changes needed since the time of project appraisal; \n(iii) assess progress of the project implementation against performance indicators; and (iv) if \nnecessary, recommend changes in the design or implementation arrangements.  \n \nD.    The Technical Assistance  \n92.  The technical assistance (TA) will lead to more effective intergovernmental coordination \nby the DPOD of the implementation of decentralization reforms. The outcome of the TA will be \nenhanced technical and analytical capacity of the DPOD to enable DPOD to effectively promote \nkey policy reforms in fiscal decentralization. In line with technical working group work plans, the \nTA will provide support to DPOD Technical Working Group members and staff, which will include \npreparing technical studies supporting the need for reforms, developing frameworks for analytical \nwork, monitoring DPOD\u2019s performance in promoting reforms, holding workshops and seminars to \ndisseminate findings, and building consensus on the need for reforms with key stakeholders. \n \n93.  The technical studies will support achievement of NAPFD milestones. The total cost of the \nTA is estimated to be $625,000 equivalent, of which $236,000 is the foreign exchange cost and \n$389,000 equivalent is the local currency cost. The Government has requested ADB to finance \nthe entire foreign exchange cost and $264,000 equivalent of the local currency cost. The TA will \nbe financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s TA funding program The Government will finance the \nbalance of the local currency cost equivalent to $125,000 through the provision of  counterpart \nstaff, office facilities, and other administrative expenses (see Appendix 10 for cost estimates and \nfinancing plan). \n \n94.  DG BAKD in MOHA will be the executing agency. The TA will be implemented over a 12- \nmonth period starting in February 2006 and ending in January 2007. It is estimated that the TA \nwill  require  50  person-months  of  consulting  support,  consisting  of  8  person-months  of \ninternational  consulting  services  and  42  person-months  of  domestic  consulting  services.  All \nconsultants shall be selected in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and \nother  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  engaging  domestic  consultants.  A  firm  will  be \nengaged through the quality- and cost-based selection method. Bio data technical proposals will \nbe used. Procurement of goods and services will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for \nProcurement. \n \nIV.  BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n \nA.  Expected Impacts \n \n95.  Policy, Legal and Regulatory Framework. The Program will strengthen, clarify and \nharmonize the policy, legal and regulatory framework for decentralization, contributing to greater \nlocal government accountability and performance. It will support a more equitable and transparent \nsystem of intergovernmental fiscal transfers that will contribute to reducing regional disparities. \nHarmonization of the regulatory framework will provide clear guidelines and directions to local \ngovernments,  and  greatly  improve  the  efficiency  of  budgeting,  control  of  expenditures,  and \nstandards of financial reporting and accounting in the Indonesian public service.  \n ", "   27\n \n96.  Institutional. The Program will have an impact on building sustainable intergovernmental \nrelations, in particular on coordination of policies and programs, and cooperation between local \ngovernments in service delivery. The establishment of the DPOD and its technical working groups \nwill facilitate greater intergovernmental coordination and consensus on key policy reforms. The \ndrafting of the NAPFD will enable the development of consensus on key policy issues, actions, \nand priorities for future fiscal decentralization. \n \n97.  Social.  By  supporting  a  proper  assignment  of  functions  and  allocation  of  adequate \nresources, the Program will enhance the quantity as well as quality of public services, and \nthereby it will directly have a beneficial impact on the poor. The Program will also contribute \nindirectly to poverty reduction through improved performance of local governments in PEFM, \nwhich should enable resources to be reallocated to priority services.  \n \n98.  Economic.  The  nature  of  the  Program  does  not  allow  for  quantitative  financial  and \neconomic analysis. However, as the major purpose of PEFM  is to achieve improved resource \nutilization,  general  economic  benefits  will  accrue  from  improvements  in  national  and  local \ngovernment operational efficiency through improved public expenditure performance and greater \naccountability.  PEFM  reforms  will  increase  the  potential  for  local  governments  to  attract \ninvestment for development.  \n \n99.  Technical.  The  Program  will  support  significant  improvements  in  managing  financial \ninformation at national and local government levels. The benefits will be reflected through more \neffective systems for strategic planning, budgeting, and financial management that are consistent \nwith varying absorptive capacities of local governments. Improved flows of financial information \nfrom  local  governments  will  help  in  determining  grants  and  other  resource  transfers.  More \nconsistent and timely availability of data will also help improve local government budgeting and \nfinancial  management  practices.  Improved  reporting  will  enhance  accountability  of  local \ngovernments to local parliaments and their citizens. Computerization of the review system for \nperdas on taxes and charges will contribute to a more efficient, equitable and transparent taxation \nsystem at the local government level. Benefits will accrue direct to citizens in the 171 local \ngovernments  participating  in  the  SIKD  and  SIPKD  components,  and  citizens  living  in  local \ngovernments participating in the tax and charges perda review system component. The Program \nwill also raise awareness of the need to develop a cadre of well-qualified financial management \nprofessionals in the civil service. \n \n100.  Resettlement, Indigenous People, and Environmental. The Project will cause no direct \nor indirect involuntary resettlement nor will it lead to any issues affecting indigenous peoples. \nBased on the desk review, the proposed project is unlikely to have adverse  environmental \nimpacts. \n \nB.  Risks \n \n  1.  Program Loan \n \n101.  The main risks relate to the uncertain policy framework and governments\u2019 commitment to \nreforms. \n \n(i)  Weak Intergovernmental Coordination. Lack of clarity in the policy framework is \nthe principal risk. Notwithstanding the adoption of the revised Laws on Regional \nAdministration and Fiscal Balance, there remains a degree of conflict between the \nperceived roles of MOF and MOHA. The new Laws on State Finance and State \n ", "28  \nTreasury assign to MOF the responsibility for national systems and procedures for \nbudgeting, financial reporting and accounting.  This presents a potential problem \nfor effective cooperation between MOF and MOHA. This risk is partly mitigated by \nthe close coordination between these ministries in the drafting of revisions to the \nGovernment  regulation  and  related  decree  on  regional  financial  management, \nwhich  promote  a  harmonized  and  consistent  framework,  coordination  on \ndevelopment of an integrated FMIS, and the establishment of DPOD. The DPOD, \nwith technical and analytical support from technical working groups, is expected to \nbe an effective forum for coordination on these issues. The two ministries have \nworked closely in formulating the NAPFD, demonstrating significant commitment \nfor greater coordination in the future. \n \n(ii)   Weaknesses in Resolving Local Government Debt Arrears. The Government \nneeds to be fully committed to debt restructuring and to coordinate effectively with \nParliament in intercepting the DAU for those districts with unresolved arrears. \nAlthough the Government has not yet made any serious attempts to resolve the \ndebt issue, recent passage of a new regulatory framework to reduce such debt in \nspecific circumstances, and the implementation of this framework to resolve debt \narrears with seven local governments and/or PDAMs is a good move forward. \n \n(iii)  Constraints Relating to Fiduciary Governance. Given the different layers of \ngovernments and the complex expenditure and revenue sharing arrangements, \ntransparency of the budget process in Indonesia is relatively weak despite political \nleadership being committed to improvements. In addition to the adoption of new \nlaws and regulations that promote public financial management reforms, MOF is \ntaking steps to improve transparency through implementation of the SIKD. The \nprogram will promote enhancement of the SIKD to reflect recent reforms in public \nfinancial  management  and  modernize  FMIS  at  national  and  local  government \nlevels  to  promote  greater  reliability  and  consistency  in  information  disclosure. \nEqually important will be the need to ensure that the information shared through \nthe SIKD is adequately evaluated to guide policy formulation to strengthen the \nintergovernmental relations. The Program will support capacity development in this \narea.  \n \n  2.  Project Loan \n \n102.  There are several risks to the successful implementation of modernization of FMIS at \nnational and local levels. \n \n(i)  Technical Capacity. Technical capacity in financial management can be built \nthrough  investment  in  appropriate  systems.  Given  the  administrative  and  civil \nservice system in place, however, the motivation of staff trained to use the new \nsystems may remain low, given the lack of performance incentives. The impact of \ninformation  systems  modernization  could  thus  be  impaired  unless  it  is \naccompanied  by  reforms  in  human  resource  management.  This  risk  will  be \nmitigated through: (a) a phased approach to reforms under the Program, which \nprovides for targeted support over the medium term; and (ii) close coordination \nwith  other  development  partners  to  ensure  that  reforms  in  human  resource \nmanagement are provided in a targeted manner.   \n \n(ii)  Political commitment. There is a risk that reforms relating to modernization of \nFMIS will be affected by a change in leadership. This risk can be mitigated partly \n ", "   29\nthrough the adoption of the investment project as a national program and provision \nof ADF resources, which will enhance local governments\u2019 absorptive capacity.  \n \nV.  ASSURANCES \n \n103.  In  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \nassurances, which have been incorporated in the legal documents. The Government will ensure \nthat:  \n(i)   Counterpart Funds will be used to finance the structural adjustment costs and local \ncurrency  costs  relating  to  the  implementation  of  the  Program  and  other  activities \nconsistent  with  the  objectives  of  the  Program,  as  more  fully  described  in  the \nDevelopment  Policy  Letter  (Appendix  2),  and  provide  the  necessary  budget \nappropriations to primarily finance such costs; \n(ii)   All necessary counterpart in-kind contributions and funds for Project implementation at \nthe national and local government levels will be provided in a timely manner;  \n(iii)    Project coordination consultants will conduct independent reviews of implementation \nprogress, procurement, disbursement, compliance with Loan Agreement covenants, \nand other relevant Project issues.  \n \nVI.

Emerging Policy Framework \n \n17.  New Laws on Public Finance. The immediate past Government recognized the need to \nupdate systems and procedures for planning, budgeting, treasury, accounting, and auditing to \npromote greater accountability and transparency. The Ministry of Finance (MOF) established \nthe Financial Management Reform Committee (KPMK) to guide financial management reforms \nand formulate policies and legislation to bring budgeting, treasury management, and accounting \npractices in line with international practices. In July 2002, KPMK published a white paper, \nReform of the Public Financial Management System in Indonesia: Principles and Strategy, \nsetting  out  the  broad  principles  for  public  expenditure  and  financial  management  (PEFM) \nreforms.  \n \n18.  In March 2003, the first of four framework laws, Law on State Finance (17/2003), was \nadopted by Parliament. This law was followed by the adoption of Laws on State Treasury \n(1/2004), State Audit (15/2004), and National Development Planning System (25/2004). These \nlaws introduce a range of new planning, budgeting, accounting, and financial management \nprinciples and procedures that affect all government entities, including local governments and \ntheir  work  units  and  enterprises.  For  the  national  Government,  key  changes  include  the \nintroduction  of  unified  performance  budgeting  using  classifications  that  comply  with  the \nGovernment Finance Statistics Manual (2001). \n \n19.  In January 2005, a Presidential Decree (2/2005) was issued under the new Law on State \nFinance to establish the Committee on Government Accounting Standards (KSAP), which now \nincludes  representatives  from  the  Ministry  of  Home  Affairs  (MOHA).  KSAP  developed  the \nConceptual Framework for Government Accounting and 11 government accounting standards \n(PSAP): Financial Statements Presentation (SAP 1); Budget Realization Statement (SAP 2); \nCash Flow Statement (SAP 3); Notes to the Financial Statements (SAP4); Inventory (SAP 5); \nInvestments (SAP 6); Fixed Assets (SAP 7); Construction in Progress (SAP 8); Liabilities (SAP \n9); Error Corrections, Changes in Accounting Policies and Extraordinary Events (SAP 10); and \nConsolidated Financial Statements (SAP 11). The SAPs have been influenced by international \npublic sector accounting standards, and accounting standards adopted by other jurisdictions \nand were incorporated into Government regulation (24/2005) issued in June 2005. Under the \nnew laws and regulations, the Government will transition to accrual accounting.1 During the \ntransition (2004\u20132007), financial reporting will be based on a modified accrual basis (also known \nas  a  modified  cash  basis).  In  addition  to  adopting  modifications  to  the  cash  basis,  the \nGovernment  will  provide  additional  disclosure  of  certain  items  normally  recognized  under \naccrual accounting, such as near-cash balances represented by receivables and payables \nsubsequently  received  or  paid,  and  various  financial  assets  and  liabilities.  Beyond  2007, \nfinancial reporting will be based on accrual accounting, under which financial transactions are \ncounted when the transaction occurs, regardless of the timing of the related cash receipt or \npayment.2 \n \n                                                 \n1 Government financial reporting is based on cash accounting, producing one major report showing the cash financial \nposition as at balance date and details of cash receipts and payments for the entity during the period. Cash-based \nfinancial reports show the sources, allocation, and use of cash resources. They show the cash required to finance \ngovernment activities, and the Government\u2019s cash position.  \n2  Accrual accounting permits assessment of the full costs of an operation and provides a simultaneous picture of \nchanges (and stocks) of public sector assets and liabilities. Accrual accounting also provides a comprehensive \npicture of Government liabilities (including payment arrears) and enables the establishment of realistic budgets \nthrough an assessment of future impacts of current policy decisions.  \n ", "   Appendix 5     49 \n21.  For local governments, a key change in adapting to new laws and regulations will be in \nthe  definition  of  managerial  accountability.  Heads  of  all  government  entities  will  be  made \naccountable for operational performance and heads of financial management (MOF nationally, \nand a chief financial manager regionally) will be made accountable for financial management. \nThe Law on State Audit strengthens the authority of the Supreme Audit Institution (BPK), which \nis responsible for the financial and general performance audit of national and local government \nfinances. BPK is required to finalize annual audited financial and performance statements within \n6 months of the end of the financial year, which are required to include, at minimum, statements \nand audit opinions with regard to budget realization, balance sheet, cash flow statement, notes, \nand statements of state regional enterprises. \n \n22.  New Law on Regional Administration. The revised Law on Regional Administration \n(32/2004) seeks consistency with the new laws on State Finance, State Treasury, and State \nAudit,3 and provides a framework for direct election of the heads of local governments and a \ngreater coordination role for the provinces.  \n \n23.  This  law  sets  out  approaches  to  establishing,  merging,  and  expansion  of  local \ngovernments. Criteria include (a) length of operation; (b) administrative factors; (c) technical \nfactors; and (d) physical factors. Special territories are also provided for. \n \n24.  This  law  bases  functional  responsibilities  on  four  principles  (a)  externality; \n(b) accountability; (c) efficiency; and (d) harmony. Government affairs are delegated to the \nregions to be accompanied by adequate funding, means, facilities, and employees. Mandatory \naffairs of provinces and districts/cities are the same. However, provinces operate region-wide \nwhile districts/cities undertake service delivery. Mandatory regional affairs are (i) development \nplanning;  (ii)  planning  and  zoning;  (iii)  public  order  /  peace;  (iv)  public  means/facilities; \n(v) health; (vi) education/human resources; (vii) social; (viii) manpower; (viii) cooperatives and \nsmall and medium enterprises; (ix) environment; (x) agrarian services; (xi) demography/civil \nregistry; (xii) government administration; (xiii) capital investments; (xiv) other basic services; and \n(xv) others.4 Some services may be delivered solely by one level of government while others \nmay involve sharing or licenses between different levels. \n \n25.  Regional administration is shared by administrations and local legislatures (DPRDs), \nneither  having  absolute  superiority.  Subnational  administration  and  DPRDs  exist  in \n(a) provinces; (b) districts/cities; (c) subdistricts; and (d) villages. Regions have autonomous \nrights, including (a) self management; (b) election of regional heads; (c) managing local public \nservice; (d) managing local assets; (e) administering local taxes and levies; (f) sharing profits of \nlocal natural resources; and (g) collecting legitimate revenues. Regional rights and obligations \nare to be brought together in regional plans, budgets, and financial management systems. \n \n26.  Regional and deputy heads are elected as pairs and have the authority to manage, \nalthough many powers are shared with the DPRD, including development of policies, plans, \nlaws, regulations, and budgets. Political heads are delegated by the President to be responsible \nand accountable for local financial management, including supervision of budget execution and \naccountability. Governors of provinces provide an annual accountability report to the President \n                                                 \n3  However, some inconsistencies continue to exist: (i) additional powers of governors / MOHA minister to control \ndeficit levels; (ii) no specific provision for a year of forward estimates; (iii) new powers for governors to review and \nannul district budgets or for MOHA to review and annul provincial budgets; (iv) new powers requiring MOF to \nconsult with MOHA before approval of regional government borrowing; and (v) Law on State Finance does not \nspecifically foreshadow the establishment of a reserve fund. \n4  Within available resources, regions may pursue additional optional affairs. \n ", "50   Appendix 5  \nthrough the MOHA, as well as to the DPRD and the public. District heads provide an annual \naccountability report to MOHA, the DPRD, and the public. The national Government is required \nto undertake a national evaluation. Provincial governors, although locally elected, represent the \nnational Government and report to the President, although they still are still accountable to the \nDPRD and the public. DPRDs are responsible for (i) drafting/passing local laws; (ii) approving \nthe regional budget in cooperation with the regional head; and (iii) supervising plans, policies, \nlaws, and finance. \n \n27.  The regional civil service (basically the same for provinces and districts) consists of (i) a \nregional secretariat, headed by a regional secretary (for provinces appointed by the President \non the governor's recommendation; for regions appointed by governor, on the district head's \nrecommendation); (ii) a DPRD secretariat chaired by a secretary; (iii) regional services, led by \nheads of services, appointed by the regional head on the recommendation of the regional \nsecretary and reporting to the regional head through the regional secretary; and (iv) regional \ntechnical  institutions  (with  similar  leadership  and  reporting  structure  to  regional  services). \nSubdistricts have heads appointed by the district head on recommendation of the regional \nsecretary. Subdistrict heads report to the district head through the regional secretary. The \ndetails of a district civil service apparatus are to be set out in a district regulation. Village units \nhave chiefs appointed by district head on the recommendation of subdistrict head. Village unit \nchiefs report to the district head through the subdistrict head. The national Government civil \nservice is integrated and includes local civil servants. National responsibilities include formation, \nprocurement, appointment, relocation, termination, pensions, salaries and allowances, welfare, \nrights  and  obligations,  and  career  development  and  control  of  numbers.  Elements  of \nappointment, promotion, transfer, and termination within local governments for echelon 2 and \nbelow has been passed to the regions, although in some cases in coordination with MOHA and \nthe Civil Service Agency. \n \n28.  Various regional regulations (perdas) are required to be evaluated and approved by the \nnational Government within seven days of enactment. Any proposal contradicting the public \ninterest or higher laws may be annulled. If disagreement occurs, the regional head may object \nto the Supreme Court, which may overturn the proposal. Provincial budgets are evaluated and \napproved by MOHA and, if in contravention of higher laws and the public interest, then the \ngovernor and the DPRD should make the requested amendments. If they refuse, MOHA can \nannul the governor\u2019s/region's regulation on the budget and declare last year\u2019s budget ceiling to \nbe in place. A similar provision is made for district budgets, which are required to be evaluated \nand approved by the governor. If rejected, the regional head and DPRD are required to make \nthe requested amendments. If they refuse, the governor can annul the budget regulation and \ndeclare last year\u2019s budget ceiling to be in place. \n \n29.  Planning provisions are broadly consistent with the original Law on Regional Autonomy \nand work plan and budget provisions with the new Law on State Finance. Regional planning is \nintegrated with national planning, and planning and budgeting are closely linked and conducted \nat the provincial and regional levels by the regional planning agency under responsibility of the \nregional head. Provincial and district government plans are prepared for 20 and 5 years and I \nyear.  Regional  work  units  (province  and  district)  are  required  to  produce  an  entity  5-year \nstrategic plan and an annual work plan linked to the budget. \n \n30.  A  framework  is  set  out  for  regional  budget  preparation,  execution,  financial \nmanagement, and reporting. Regional heads (delegated by the President) have authority for all \nfinancial management matters. However, heads are required to delegate authorities to regional \nofficials  for  budget  planning,  budget  execution,  administration,  reporting,  accountability, \n ", "   Appendix 5     51 \nmanagement, and supervision. Regional expenditures are to be effective re desired outcomes, \nallocated to key priorities, minimum service standards (SPM), price standards, and performance \nbenchmarks. With budget preparation, the regional head is required to set broad priorities and \nceilings while the budget\u2014including the annual work plan\u2014is prepared by the regional finance \nofficer in conjunction with the heads of regional work units. Budget approval (and revisions to \napproved budgets) is a joint process involving both the head of the region and the DPRD. \nProcedures to apply in the event of dispute between the head and the DPRD are not clearly set \nout. With budget execution, all regions are required to develop a regional financial management \ninformation system (SIPKD) as part of a regional administration information system. All financial \ntransactions should be on budget and pass through a single treasury account managed by the \nregional general treasurer. The regional head (or his delegate) is required to authorize all \nbudget expenditures. Brief provisions are set out for cash management and bank accounts. \nBudget  reporting  and  accountability  requires  an  annual  audited  statement  in  line  with \nGovernment accounting standards to go to the DPRD within 6 months of the year's end, \nincluding  budget  realization,  balance  sheet,  cash  flow  statement,  notes,  and  financial \nstatements of local state enterprises.  \n \n31.  Regions  with  the  necessary  approvals  may  borrow,  and issue  regional  bonds. Any \nforeign borrowing (including on lending) requires MOF approval after consultation with MOHA. \nThis new role for MOHA is not consistent with the new Law on State Finance, which only \nrequires MOF approval. \n \n32.  The law provides for the operation of regional reserve funds and state enterprises. Uses \nof budget surpluses and the financing of budget deficits are addressed. MOHA is authorized to \ncontrol regional budget deficits and monitor them every 6 months. Where an approved budget is \nnot in place by the start of the year, the previous year\u2019s approved ceilings may be used on \napproval (in 30 days) of MOHA for provinces and governors for districts. \n \n33.  Disputes  within  a  province  are  addressed  by  the  governor  while  disputes  between \nprovinces are addressed by MOHA. Cooperation agreements between regions and third parties \nare encouraged. Issues of city zones and boundaries are briefly addressed. \n \n34.  Villages have an elected village chief and council (both for 6 years) as well as an \nappointed village secretary. The village chief has authority to manage village finances. Village \nregulations (consistent with a district regulation) are to be adapted to govern the management of \nvillage finances.  \n \n35.  Higher-level governments are required to help enhance and supervise performance and \ncapacity  of  lower  levels  of  government,  down  to  the  villages.  Supervision  of  regional \ngovernment affairs and regulations occurs through the national Government internal supervision \napparatus.  The  national  Government  may  make  awards  and  issue  penalties.  MOHA  is \nresponsible  for  enhancing  provincial  capacity,  while  regional  heads  are  responsible  at  the \ndistricts and lower government levels. \n \n36.  The President may establish a council to advise him on regional policies, particularly \n(i) regional boundaries; (ii) special zones; and (iii) fiscal balance (including revenue sharing, \nresource sharing, calculation of the general allocation grant (DAU) and special allocation grant \n(DAK). The council will be chaired by the MOHA. Membership, organization, structure, and \nadministration will be regulated by a presidential decree. \n  \n ", "52   Appendix 5  \n37.  The new law is broad and many national/regional regulations/decrees are still needed, \nincluding, nationally, (i) number/size of regions; (ii) division of affairs between different levels of \ngovernment; (iii) intergovernmental  relations; (iv) service  delivery responsibilities and SPM; \n(v) authorities,  roles,  responsibilities  for  natural  resource  management;  (vi)  civil  service \nstructures for provinces; (vii) authorities, duties, obligations, accountabilities of regional heads \nand  evaluations  by  the  national  Government;  (viii)  duties,  obligations,  and  financing \narrangements for provincial governors; (ix) policies, standards, and procedures for the regional \ncivil service; (x) provisions in relation to taxes and levies; (xi) emergency allocations in local \nbudgets; (xii) SPM, price standards, and performance benchmarks; (xiii) procedures for the \nissue of local government bonds; (xiv) decree on guidelines for tax sharing, natural resource \nsharing, general and special allocation grants (DAU and DAK); (xv) decree on membership, \norganization, structure, and administration of the council; and (xvi) decree on the number, size, \nand structure of vertical institutions implementing de-concentrated expenditures in the regions.  \n \n38.  Revised Law on Fiscal Balance. The revised Law on Fiscal Balance (Law 33/2004) is \nfundamentally the same as the original Law on Fiscal Balance although changes have been \nmade with respect to, among others, the framework for regional borrowing and improvement to \nthe formulation of the DAU in 2008. In general, the revised law provides a broad framework and \nleaves  many  important  issues  for  implementing  regulations.  The  revised  law  aims  for \nconsistency with new Laws on State Finance, State Treasury, State Audit, and revised Law on \nRegional  Administration.  National  public  finance  policy  focuses  on  redistribution  and \nstabilization, while regions focus on allocative effectiveness and efficiency. Intergovernmental \nfinancing, while based on paramount national authority, aims for fair sharing of authority and \nresponsibilities  and  recognizes  principles  of  regional  equalization  and  that  adequate  funds \nshould follow decentralized functions. \n \n39.  Regional  financing  includes  decentralized  responsibilities,  deconcentrated  national \nexpenditures,  and  co\u2013administered  expenditures.  A  fundamental  aim  is  to  provide  for \nreasonable equalization between regions, with a narrowing of fiscal gaps. Funding sources for \ndecentralized  responsibilities  include  own  revenues  (PAD),  balance  fund  (DAU  and  DAK), \nregional borrowing, and other local income sources.  \n \n40.  Sources of PAD are (a) regional taxes; (b) regional fees and levies; (c) income from \nregional assets; and (d) other legal revenue forms (interest, foreign exchange profits, sales \netc.). Within the context of ultimate national authority, regions have flexibility to raise revenues. \nHowever, they cannot create regional revenue laws that are uncompetitive or lead to a higher-\ncost economy, and hamper mobility of people, trade, or commerce. \n \n41.  Revenue sharing is based on realized receipts in the current year\u2019s budget. Revenue \nsharing relates to land and building taxes, apportioned as follows: (i) province of origin (16.2%), \ndistrict/city  of  origin  (64.8%),  all  districts/cities  of  Indonesia  equally  (6.5%),  incentives  to \ndistricts/cities whose realized land tax collections exceed budgeted levels (3.5%), and collection \ncosts (9.0%); (ii) land and building title transfers: province of origin (16.0%), district/city of origin \n(64.0%), and all districts/cities of Indonesia equally (20.0%); and (iii) personal income taxes: \nnational government (80%), province of origin (8%), and districts/city of origin (12%). \n \n42.

When they do, adjustment occurs through a revised national \nbudget by way of additional DAU. The 0.5% levy on oil and gas revenues is earmarked for \nelementary education expenditures. \n \n43.  The total DAU by 2008 is required to be at least 26.0% of net domestic revenues (tax \nand non-tax revenues minus receipts shared with regions). The rate remains at 25.0% for the \n2005 budget, rising to 25.5% for the 2006 and 2007 budgets. In the 2006 and 2007 budgets, no \nregion may receive less DAU than in the 2005 budget. The DAU is divided into (i) basic \nallocation,  calculated  on  total  salaries  and  allowances  of  civil  servants  in  a  region;  and \n(ii) equalizing allocation, based on the fiscal gap, defined as fiscal need minus fiscal capacity. \nFiscal need is defined as amounts needed to fund basic public services (health, education, \ninfrastructure, and poverty reduction services). Broad criteria are given to help measure fiscal \nneed: (i) total population; (ii) land area; (iii) construction cost index; (iv) GDP per capita; and \n(v) human development index. Criteria for fiscal need are general with no operational formula. In \nthe equalization allocation, fiscal capacity is defined as regional own revenues plus shared \nrevenues. General criteria are to be established for sharing the DAU between provinces and \ndistricts/cities based on authorities/responsibilities of different levels of government. Provincial \nand district/city DAU amounts are conceptually determined in relation to levels of fiscal gaps in \neach location, but no effective operational formulae are provided. DAU distributions are to be \nformulated in consultation with the council. General allocations (always positive) can be offset \nby  negative  equalization  allocations  (i.e.,  where  fiscal  capacity  exceeds  fiscal  need).  After \noffsets it is possible for regions to receive zero (but not negative) DAU. \n \n44.  DAK amounts are set annually in the national budget to support special activities in the \nregions in line with Government criteria. Not all regions receive DAK. Conceptually, the new law \nprovides  (i)  general  criteria,  based  on  financial  capacity  (regional  budget  receipts  minus \npersonnel expenditures); (ii) special criteria, based on key regional characteristics, including \ncoastal areas, foreign borders, offshore areas, remoteness, backwardness, whether prone to \n ", "54   Appendix 5  \nfloods, landslides, or famines; and (iii) technical criteria, based on infrastructure standards. The \ncriteria do not provide a practical formula approach to selection of the total quantum or specific \nallocations. Generally, regions are required to provide matching funds equivalent to at least 10% \nof DAK allocations, although this may be waived for poorer regions. \n \n45.  Foreign  grants  are  required  to  pass  through  the  national  Government  (backed  by \nagreements between foreign donors and regional governments). Emergency funds may be \nestablished to cover contingencies such as natural disasters, extraordinary events and solvency \ncrises as declared by the President. \n \n46.  The national Government is required to annually establish maximum levels of combined \nnational and regional government debt, which shall not exceed 60% of gross domestic product \n(GDP). MOF will establish a total regional debt limit by August annually for the following budget \nyear. Regional government borrowing may be sourced through (i) the national Government \n(MOF),  (ii) other  regional  governments,  (iii)  banks  and  financial  institutions,  (iv)  nonbank \nfinancial institutions, and (v) the public through bond issues. Regional governments cannot \ndirectly borrow from foreign sources but may do so indirectly through on-lending of foreign funds \nby the national Government. Regional borrowing must meet prescribed criteria: (i) balances of \nexisting loans plus new loans to be approved may not exceed 75% of total receipts in the \nprevious year\u2019s budget (excluding DAK, emergency fund, current loans, and other financing); \n(ii) financial capacity ratios to be set by the Government; and (iii) zero arrears on debts from the \nnational Government. Regional governments may not guarantee borrowings of third parties. \nRegional  revenues  and  assets  may  not  be  pledged  for  regional  loans.  However,  projects \nfinanced by regional bonds may pledge project assets. Regional bonds are limited to projects \nthat finance public investments, generate income, and provide public benefits. Approval of the \nregional head, the DPRD, and the national Government is required in the context of annual \nbudgets  before  bond  issues,  which  are  required  to  be  backed  by  a  perda.  The  national \nGovernment may not guarantee regional bonds. The regional head (and his delegates) is \nrequired to manage debt portfolios in line with established debt management/risk policies. \nRegions are required to report every 6 months to the national Government on the regional \nbonds' portfolio. Any debt service arrears to the national Government may be withheld from \nDAU or revenue-sharing payments.  \n \n47.  General principles on financial management largely mirror those in the new Laws on \nState Finance, State Treasury and State Audit. All receipts and payments are to be provided for \nthrough the annual budget. The annual Budget Law is the basis for budget execution, financial \naccountability, and sound financial management. Generally operating expenditures should not \nexceed revenues. The regional government should draw up an annual regional work plan as \npart of national development planning requirements and as the basis for preparing the annual \nbudget. The annual budget shall consist of (i) revenues, (ii) expenditures, and (iii) financing. \nExpenditures shall be classified by (a) Organization; (b) Program; (c) Activity; (d) Function \n(GFS); and (e) Type (GFS economic).  \n \n48.  Broad steps in the work plan and budget preparation cycle are the following: (i) the \nregional government discusses plans and policies with the DPRD in June; (ii) the regional \ngovernment and the DPRD determine priorities and ceilings; (iii) regional heads of work units \nprepare  draft  unit  work  plans  and  budgets;  (iv)  draft  work  plans  and  budgets  are  to  be \nperformance-oriented  and  include  one  year  of  forward  estimates;  (v)  unit  work  plans  and \nbudgets are then discussed by the regional head with the DPRD; (vi) the chief regional finance \nofficial finalizes the budget documents and a draft budget law; and (vii) regional head discusses \n ", "   Appendix 5     55 \nthe budget and draft law with the DPRD and seeks joint agreement to final issue of the related \nperda).  \n \n49.  The Budget Law is the basis for making all payments. Where it is not passed on time, \nmonthly expenditures, reflecting the previous year's levels, may be continued. Heads of work \nunits are required to prepare budget implementation documents based on budget allocations \nestablished by the regional head. All receipts and payments pass through a single treasury \naccount under control of the regional treasurer. In specified emergencies, regional governments \ncan spend on non-budgeted items but must validate them in a revised budget (usually prepared \nonly once a year and must go to the DPRD by 30 September) or alternatively in a budget \nrealization  report.  Regional  governments  may  set  up  a  reserve  fund  for  unforeseen \ncontingencies, which can be funded by receipts but not by DAK, loans or other restricted \nreceipts. The reserve fund is maintained separately from the regional treasury account and \nbalances may be invested in low risk securities.  \n \n50.  An  annual  statement  (by  way  of  law)  is  submitted  to  the  DPRD  by  the  regional \ngovernment by 30 June in each year, covering the previous financial year. It contains an audited \nannual  financial  report  covering  (i)  budget  realization  (revenues,  expenditures,  and \noutput/results  performance  of  all work  units);  (ii)  balance  sheet;  (iii)  cash  flow  report;  and \n(iv) notes, including reports from region-owned enterprises. Financial reporting needs to be in \nline with Government accounting standards. An audit by BPK should occur annually and at the \nend of terms of the regional head and the DPRD. \n \n51.  MOF is required to establish criteria for combined national and regional government \ndeficit levels each year. Combined levels should not exceed 3% of GDP in any year. By August \neach year, MOF is required to issue criteria for maximum regional deficits (combined and \nindividually) for the next budget year. \n \n52.  De-concentrated funding occurs through delegated authority of the national Government \nthrough  national  line  ministries  and  institutions  to  the  provincial  governor.  The  governor \nestablishes provincial work units to execute de-concentrated expenditures. The Governor briefs \nthe DPRD on de-concentration expenditure plans at the time of budget formulation. The de-\nconcentration mechanism does not formally extend to districts, subdistricts, or villages. Funding \nis  by  the  national  Government  and  is  based  on  nonphysical  activities.  For  budgeting, \naccounting, and reporting purposes, de-concentrated expenditures are part of the state budget, \nincluded in work plans and budgets of relevant state ministries and institutions, and funding is \ndistributed through the state treasury. Any surplus funds are returned to the state treasury and \nany income earned is state income. Any assets purchased are assets of the state although they \nmay  be  donated  to  the  provincial  government.  The  executing  work  unit  is  responsible  for \nadministration and accounting and for submitting accountability reports to the governor. The \ngovernor  submits  accountability  reports  to  relevant  state  ministries  and  institutions,  which \nprovide accountability reports to the President. Accountability reports include financial aspects \nand assessments of outputs and results. Outlays are subject to supervision and audit in line with \nthe new Laws on State Finance and State Audit.  \n \n53.   Co-administered  funding  is  by  the  national  Government  after  assignment  by  state \nministries and institutions to regional heads. Funding is possible at provincial and district/city \nlevels. The relevant governor, head of district (bupati), or mayor of city (collectively \u201cregional \nhead\u201d), establishes work units to manage and execute co-administered expenditures. Funding is \nfor physical activities. The regional head informs the DPRD of co-administration programs at the \ntime of budget preparation. For budgeting, accounting and reporting purposes, co-administered \n ", "56   Appendix 5  \nexpenditures are part of the state budget and are included in work plans and budgets of relevant \nstate  ministries  and  institutions,  and  funding  is  distributed  through  the  state  treasury.  Any \nsurplus funds are returned to the state treasury and any income earned is state income. Any \nassets purchased are assets of the state although they may be donated to local governments. \nThe  regional  executing  work  unit  is  responsible  for  administration  and  accounting  and  for \nsubmitting  accountability  reports  to  the  provincial  head.  The  provincial  head  submits \naccountability reports to relevant state ministries and institutions, which provide accountability \nreports to the President. Accountability reports include financial reporting and assessments of \noutputs and results. Outlays are subject to supervision and audit in line with new Laws on State \nFinance and State Audit. \n \n54.  Consistent with the original Law on Fiscal Balance, the national Government is required \nto set up and manage the regional financial information system (SIKD). Regional governments \nare required to provide the national Government with reliable information through the gradual \nsetting up of regional financial management information systems (SIPKD). Information to be \nprovided to national Government includes (i) budget, (ii) budget realization, (iii) balance sheet, \n(iv)  cash  flows,  (v)  financial  notes,  (vi)  de-concentrated  expenditures,  (vii)  co-administered \nexpenditures,  (viii)  regional  public  enterprises,  and  (ix)  data  on  fiscal  needs  and  fiscal \ncapacities.  Information  in  relation  to  points  (i)  to  (iv)  should  be  in  line  with  Government \naccounting standards. MOF can sanction non-cooperating regional governments by delaying \nDAU payments. Information collected is to be open to the public. \n \n55.  Regulations adopted under the original Law on Fiscal Balance remain in force unless \nreplaced by new regulations. Any new regulations are required to be finalized within 12 months \nof adoption of this law, provided that implementation of the following provisions is specifically \ndelayed: (i) new revenue sharing for oil and gas will not commence until 2009. (ii) new DAU \ntransfer ratios are to be based on 25.5% of net domestic revenues for the 2006 and 2007 \nbudgets, rising to a minimum of 26.0 % for the 2008 budget. For the 2006 and 2007 budgets \nDAU  transfers  shall  not  be  less  than  amounts  provided  in  2005.  (iii)  De-concentration/co-\nadministration expenditures to be gradually transferred to DAK.  \n \n56.  The revised Law on Fiscal Balance provides only a broad framework. Many national \nregulations will need to be either confirmed from the original Law on Fiscal Balance or newly \nissued, including (i) revenue-sharing arrangements; (ii) calculation of the DAU (weightings, \nformulae, allocations between provinces and districts/cities, and the method of distribution); (iii) \ncalculation of the DAK (total amounts; specification of general, special, and technical criteria, \nreporting, and accountability arrangements); (iv) procedures for grants and emergency funds; \n(v) regional borrowing (including borrowing and limits criteria); (vi) preparation of annual regional \nwork plans and budgets; (vii) management of regional finances; (viii) budgeting, distribution, \nreporting, accountability and donation of de-concentrated outlays; (ix) budgeting, distribution, \nreporting,  accountability  and  donation  of  co-administered  outlays;  (x)  management  of  the \ninformation system (mechanisms for submitting information, principles for managing regional \nsystems,  reporting  formats,  and  penalties);  and  (xi)  transfer  of  de-concentration  and  co-\nadministration expenditures to DAK.  \n \nC.  Local Government Performance and Accountability \n \n57.  The performance of local governments in the core service areas of health, education, \nand  economic  development  varies  widely  between  regions.  Quality  of  health  services  has \nalways varied greatly, with some provinces having on average five times the number of health \nworkers  as  others.  Since  2001,  some  regions  have  prioritized  health,  by  giving  special \n ", "   Appendix 5     57 \nincentives for doctors working in rural clinics, or by creating simple medical insurance schemes \nfor the poor. Others have increased hospital charges, thus reducing access of the poor to health \nservices. \n \n58.  Education also had high levels of disparity before decentralization. Unfortunately, the \nregions with the lowest levels of education are also frequently poorly funded regions with few \nresources to improve investment in education. Many regions have identified education as the \nkey  sector  for  long-term  development  and  provided  additional  allowances  to  attract  well-\nqualified teachers from elsewhere, introduced competence testing for school principals, and are \ninvesting in good libraries and laboratories. Other regions are ignoring investment in this sector. \nIn one reported case, the regent was suspended after weeks of demonstrations and strikes by \nteachers and pupils over low budget allocations for education. \n \n59.  Economic development overall has been slow since the economic crisis of 1997\u20131998. \nSome regions with high commodity exports have been able to maintain significant growth, but \nmost regions have found it hard to attract investors or reduce unemployment. Some regions \nhave developed policies to attract development, or have engaged in aggressive marketing \ncampaigns, usually not yet well focused on investors\u2019 interests or needs, but the experience \nshould help them. In East Java, the Jawa Pos Institute of Pro-Otonomi, a subsidiary of the \nlargest regional daily newspaper, presents an annual award for regions with the best policies to \npromote  economic  growth  and  a  secure  investment  environment,  with  regions  competing \nearnestly for the coveted award. Other regions, however, have tried to increase government \nrevenues  by  raising  road  charges  so  much  that  farmers  are  being  forced  back  into  a \nsubsistence economy. \n \n60.  Much has been made of the low capacity of regional administrations to implement \nchange, despite the extraordinary changes that all regions have undergone over the past 6 \nyears. Few have qualified accountants and auditors and, more significantly, there is not yet a \nprofessional position created for financial managers, although all regions now have greatly \nincreased powers in relation to finance. New Laws on State Finance, State Treasury, and the \nrevised law on Regional Administration and Regional Fiscal Balance establish positions of chief \nfinancial officers within all levels of regional government, the details of which are being clarified \nunder implementing regulations.  \n \n61.  All regions are now beginning to prepare and implement strategic planning in all their \nentities. An earlier ADB study indicated that few of these plans are strategic for a number of key \nreasons:  (i)  lack  of  effective  training  to  help  senior  officials  progress  from  being  mere \nadministrators to managers, (ii) a system of planning that still separates personnel planning and \norganizational design from strategic planning and the budgeting process, and (iii) lack of policy \nsupport for change (as regional entity managers rely on the head of the region and the DPRD \nfor the policy framework). Planning requirements for regional governments and their entities \nhave been strengthened under the new legal framework and will be clarified further in new \nimplementing regulations.  \n \n62.  It is estimated that only around 60% of regions have managed to change to the unified \nbudget system provided for under the original decentralization laws. Most regions have not yet \nestablished a clear identification of performance requirements of programs or even a clear \nprogram of work within each entity. Accordingly, migration from existing requirements to the new \nlegal and regulatory requirements creates major challenges for capacity building in the regions.  \n \n \n ", "58    Appendix 6  \nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY \n \nA.  Linkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \n   \nIs the sector identified as a national    Yes  Is the sector identified as a national    Yes \npriority in country poverty analysis?   No  national priority in country poverty     No \npartnership agreement?  \nContribution of the sector/subsector to reduce poverty in Indonesia: \n \nPoverty has been reduced at an uneven pace in Indonesia\u2014one of the poorest countries in the world in the 1960s \nand seemed set to achieve middle income by the 1990s. However, even before the crisis, poverty reduction was not \ncommensurate with the rate of growth, and sharper instruments than broad-based growth were clearly required. \nFollowing decentralization in 2001, local government became the principal agent for poverty reduction and achieving \nMillenium Development Goals (MDGs). Local governments are responsible for delivery of most basic services \nrequired by the poor.1 The principal instrument used by local government is the budget, but unclear rules, \ninadequate safeguards, and overlapping assignments of functions prevent its effective use.  \n \nIndonesian poverty, whether measured in money metric or other terms, is characterized by persistent inequality. In \n2004, the national poverty prevalence was 16.6% ranging from 3.2 % in DKI Jakarta Province to 40.2 % in West \nIrian Jaya Province.2 In 2003, national under-5 malnutrition was 27.1%, ranging from 16.0 % in Bali to 46.1 % in \nGorontalo. Local government financial capacity was similarly unequal and the central Government lacked an \ninstrument to address these inequalities.  \n \nThe Government is preparing a poverty reduction strategy.3  The paper recognizes the role of government but does \nnot distinguish among the responsibilities of different levels of government. Nonetheless, as implementation of the \nnational strategy rests principally with the local governments and their mandate to deliver health, education, \nbusiness development, employment, trade, environment, and safety services with the support of line agencies and \ndepartments, strengthening local governments is the first step to implementing the national poverty reduction \nstrategy. The Government\u2013ADB poverty reduction partnership agreement also recognized that \u201csupport of weaker \nlocal governments is required to prevent worsening of regional inequity\u201d.  \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis  Targeting Classification: Other \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?\n \nThe  Local  Government  Finance  and  Governance  Reform  Sector  Development  Program  addresses  the  key \nbottlenecks hindering the efficient and accountable functioning of local government. The main issues are related to \n(i) mechanisms to coordinate decentralization reforms among stakeholders, (ii) equity in financial transfers, (iii) local \ntaxation and nuisance taxes; (iv) responsibility by level of government; (v) regional borrowing and arrears; and \n(vi) financial management systems.  \n \nThe key national agencies involved in local government financial management, budgeting, and planning are the \nMinistry of Finance, the Ministry of Home Affairs, and the National Development Planning Agency. The new approach \nto public sector management requires integration and harmonization of the policy and regulatory environment across \nstakeholders. Financial transfers need to be linked to obligatory responsibilities and fiscal needs. They are not, given \nvarious constraints. The net effect has been the favoring of resource-rich districts over poor, and small districts over \nlarge.4 Clarifying tax authorities and implementing a review system for nuisance taxes will enable districts to raise \nown revenues in a pro-poor way5. An ADB TA studying the impact of obligatory functions and minimum service \nstandards (OF&SPM) on districts planning, budgeting, and institutional structure found that one major impediment to \n                                                 \n1  Water supply, sanitation, health, education, local roads, peace and order, birth certificates. \n2  Note: The former province of Irian Jaya was renamed Papua and then split into three provinces under Law \n21/2001: West Irian Jaya, Central Irian Jaya, and East Irian Jaya. In 2004, the National Statistical Agency provided \na separate poverty estimates for West Irian Jaya and the rest of Papua. \n3  Finalized in September 2005. \n4  The general allocation fund (DAU) is regressive in that districts with large populations receive less per capita than \nsmall ones. Kotamadya Sabang, for example, with 28,000 people and about 8,900 poor, receives Rp2,700 per \ncapita. Kabupaten Lembata, with 98,000 people and 33,000 poor, receives Rp1,270 per capita. At the other \nextreme, Kabupaten Bogor and Bandung, with 3.8 million and 4.1 million people and 450,000 and 480,000 poor, \nreceive Rp.146 and Rp.185 per capita each. \n5  Inter-district movement of goods is easy to tax, however, as agricultural products are a large proportion of cross-\ndistrict trade, so agricultural workers bear the burden of the tax. \n ", "App  endix 6    59 \nimplementing the OF&SPM was confusion over function and levels of responsibility.  \n \nLocal governments require borrowing instruments that match their investment needs, from a variety of sources,  \nincluding International Financial Institutions and the private sector. In particular, local governments require sources of \nfunding for long-term investments such as education, water supply, and sanitation. Local government arrears to the \ncentral Government constrain the ability of districts to expand water supply systems. The central Government needs \nto manage national and local debt and address key issues related to risk management, such as collateral and dealing \nwith default. Finally, each level of government requires timely, accurate, and sufficient financial management \ninformation based on reliable accounting standards. Considerable capacity building is needed to introduce new \naccounting standards and new planning, budgeting, and financial management requirements under the new laws on \nstate finance, national development planning system, and revised laws on regional administration and regional fiscal \nbalance.  \n \nThe program initiates the process of strengthening the environment for local government finance reforms by \n(i) enhancing intergovernmental coordination and development of a National Action Plan for Fiscal Decentralization, \n(ii) strengthening  and harmonizing the framework for regional  autonomy, (iii) strengthening, rationalizing,  and \nharmonizing  the  framework  for  intergovernmental  fiscal  relations,  and  (iv)  strengthening  and  harmonizing  the \nframework for planning, budgeting, and financial management. An investment component under this program will \nstart modernizing the public financial management systems. \n \nThese reforms provide a platform for clarifying obligatory functions, establishing minimum service standards, taking \ninto account fiscal constraints, providing tools to address regional disparities, promoting measures to enhance \naccountability, and strengthening local institutions. \n \nThus the proposed loan initiates a coordinated and prioritized program to empower local governments to plan, \nbudget, and deliver access to poverty-reducing services while providing the central Government with the instruments \nto reduce regional inequality. These reforms and the proposed follow-on phases will provide local governments with \nincreased resources for delivering basic services through increased efficiency in the use of own resources, additional \nresources from the central Government where needed, greater ability to raise additional resources for investments \nwith long term payback periods such as health and education, and the central Government is able to make more \neffective use of resources by directing them where they are needed. A by-product of budget transparency and linking \nof policy to budget will be greater satisfaction of citizenry, particularly the disaffected poor, greater confidence in \ngovernment, and, hence, greater willingness to support poverty-reducing measures by the poor and nonpoor alike. \n \nThe program provides government the means to increase access to services for the poor. However, this in itself does \nnot guarantee increased access, which depends on policies and their effective implementation. The heightened focus \nof central and local governments on poverty and preparation of national and local poverty reduction strategies \nstrongly suggests this will occur. \nC.
