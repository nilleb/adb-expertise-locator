THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed policy-\nbased grant to the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) for subprogram 2 of the Health \nSector Governance Program.1 \n \n2.  The program supports the government\u2019s Health Sector Reform Strategy (HSRS),2 which \naims to achieve universal health coverage (UHC) by 2025 and the Sustainable Development \nGoals (SDGs) by 2030.3 The HSRS is implemented through health sector development plans \n(HSDPs). Subprogram 1 supported the 7th HSDP (2011\u20132015),4 while subprogram 2 aligns with \nthe 8th HSDP (2016\u20132020).5 Policy actions under both subprograms target health sector reform \n(HSR) processes, health care access for vulnerable groups, quality improvement of health \npersonnel, and sound public financial management. \n \nII.  PROGRAM AND RATIONALE \n \nA.  Background and Development Constraints \n \n3.  Equitable  and  inclusive  growth.  The  8th  Five-Year  National  Socio-Economic \nDevelopment Plan (NSEDP) (2016\u20132020) aims for the Lao PDR to graduate from least-developed \ncountry status by 2020, and become an upper middle-income country by 2030.6 Forecasts for \n2017 indicate that the country\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) grew 6.8%, resulting in GDP per \ncapita of $2,579, and its poverty rate fell to 20.0%.7 Significant development challenges remain, \nhowever, including (i) a high fiscal deficit, (ii) accumulated public and publicly guaranteed debt, \nand (iii) an undiversified resource-based economy. The government recognizes that equitable \nand inclusive growth requires targeted policy interventions for vulnerable groups, and the NSEDP \ncommits sustained investment to improve access to and the quality of basic social services such \nas health care, with a view to improving health outcomes, especially for the poor, women, and \nchildren. Better health of the workforce results in lower absenteeism, higher labor productivity, \nand increased wages, all of which contribute to economic growth. Such effects are particularly \nimportant in countries where many are engaged in unskilled labor.8 \n \n4.  Unfulfilled health targets. The Lao PDR has made good progress in achieving many \nhealth targets:9 (i) life expectancy in 2015 was 68 years, and (ii) the maternal mortality ratio \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  Government of the Lao PDR, Ministry of Health (MOH). 2013.

Communicable diseases \nsuch as HIV, malaria, and tuberculosis are prevalent.13 The incidence of noncommunicable \ndiseases, accidents, and injuries remains significant as well; the World Health Organization \n(WHO) reported that noncommunicable diseases constituted 60% of the burden of disease in \n2008, while accidents and injuries accounted for 10%.14  \n \n5.  Limited utilization of health care services. Poor health outcomes are closely linked to \nthe limited use of health services. The overall use of public health services is reported to have \nincreased fivefold during 2000\u20132013 to about 0.6 visits per person per year (footnote 12), but this \nis still low and gaps in coverage remain between the poor and rich, and rural and non-rural \npopulations, especially for MNCH services, including immunization, antenatal care, skilled birth \nattendance, and surgery. Children in the poorest quintile are 3.6 times more likely to die before \nreaching age 5 compared with those in the wealthiest quintile, and children born in Phongsaly \nprovince are five times more likely to die before reaching age 5 than those born in Vientiane.15 \n \n6.  The proposed policy-based grant\u2014which is contingent on the achievement of policy \nactions, including robust policies and strategies for health and finance\u2014can alleviate some of \nthese macroeconomic and health burdens.16 The program targets four critical areas of reform: \nimproving HSR processes; improving implementation of free health care for the poor, mothers, \nand children; strengthening human resource management capacity; and strengthening the health \nsector\u2019s financial management system. \n \n7.  Improving  health  sector  reform  processes.  Three  critical  issues  impede  smooth \nimplementation of HSR. First, no governing body manages and plans HSR, in part because of a \nlack of competent managers with adequate leadership skills at central, provincial, and district \nlevels and across Ministry of Health (MOH) departments. This affects MOH\u2019s ability to advocate \nfor HSR and its related plans at the broader policy level and to respond quickly to new policy \nchallenges. Second, although health sector coordination\u2014across ministries, departments, and \ndevelopment partners\u2014has improved, fragmentation, duplication, and misalignment remain. This \nis in part because of a lack of direction or planning for key areas, such as health financing and \nhuman resources, which can result in limited resources being used inefficiently. Third, progress \nunder the government\u2019s decentralization program has been incremental and inconsistent because \n                                                \n10 Government of the Lao PDR, MOH. 2016.

Infant mortality is defined as deaths \nbetween birth and age 1. \n13 In 2016, HIV prevalence among Lao men and women aged 15\u201349 years old was 0.3% (WHO. 2016. Country Profiles \non HIV: Lao PDR). In the same year, the Lao PDR had about 27,390 cases of malaria (WHO. 2016. Malaria Country \nProfiles: Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic).

Improving implementation of free health care. Relatively low government spending on \nhealth is reflected in high private out-of-pocket (OOP) payments, making health care unaffordable \nfor many. The government is seeking to reduce OOP payments from 45.1% of total health \nexpenditure in FY2016 to 30% by 2025.19 The government has subsidized specific groups \n(including the poor, mothers, and children) through programs such as health equity funds (HEFs) \nand free maternal, newborn, and child health care (FMNCH). The Lao PDR shifted to a national, \npredominantly prepaid financing mechanism in 2015, however, and introduced National Health \nInsurance (NHI). NHI drastically increased population coverage, enlarged the risk pool, and \nreduced fragmentation between different schemes, beginning with the absorption of HEF and \nFMNCH. The government has also rapidly mobilized resources through an earmarked NHI fund \nadministered by the National Health Insurance Bureau (NHIB).20 NHI has empowered people \nthrough simplified rules to access health benefits and increased predictability of health care \nfinancing. Once enrolled and upon payment of a fixed co-payment at a facility, patients are \ncovered for a range of benefits, including all inpatient and outpatient services and medicines. Co-\npayments are waived for the poor, mothers, and children under 5 upon presentation of qualifying \nidentification at the point of use. The government will continue to expand NHI and introduce \nimplementation improvements, including quality interventions such as performance-based pay for \nhealth workers, as the scheme matures. This is expected to increase health service utilization, \nwhich will contribute significantly to health outcomes. \n \n9.  Strengthening human resource management. The Lao PDR has 3.1 health workers \nper 1,000 people, but this average obscures the poor situation in rural and remote areas and does \nnot indicate what skills are available.21 Although most health centers have nurses, a medical \nassistant, and a midwife, specialty staff (e.g., laboratory technicians and pharmacists) are not \nalways available. Health personnel databases for planning staff distribution and skills are still not \nfully functional. Many health workers have fewer than 3 years of professional training and receive \nno regular in-service training and supportive supervision. There are also concerns about the \ncommitment of health personnel: many health facilities have difficulty in hiring and retaining good \nquality staff, and one survey found that 34% of health workers, in particular those from district \nhealth centers, had changed jobs within 2 years.22 These issues stem in part from inadequate \nand substandard medical education and training. The Lao PDR has not approved standards \nregarding accreditation of institutions and a national exam to assess qualification and skills. \nInstead, graduates from medical institutions are given a permit or license to practice, which they \ncan hold indefinitely (there are no regulations for license renewal). The development of provincial \nworkforce plans that reflect staff profiles and requirements and make recommendations on staff \nincentives, in addition to the creation of a personnel database, will help address these challenges. \n \n                                                \n17 The Sam Sang or \u201cthree builds\u201d decentralization directive proposes that villages will serve as the development unit, \ndistricts as the integration unit, and provinces as the strategic unit. \n18 Laos-Australia  Development  Learning  Facility.  2015.

Global Health Observatory Data: Health \nWorkforce). \n22 ADB. Summary Report on Human Resources for Health. Consultant\u2019s report. Unpublished. \n ", "4 \n10.  Strengthening  the  health  sector  financial  management  system.  In  2013,  the \ngovernment committed to increase health spending to 9% of general government expenditure \n(GGE), including external aid and technical revenue.23 Although domestic government spending \non health has doubled during 2009\u20132013, health expenditure as a share of GGE averages just \n5.9%, and the situation is worsened by declining external aid.24 Health budget allocations vary \nsignificantly  by  province,  and  formulas  to  balance  these  allocations  have  not  yet  been \nintroduced.25 Financial management is not rigorous; with manual bookkeeping and multiple \npayment sources, leading to fragmented and inaccurate monitoring of expenditures. Moreover, \nprogram and finance budget preparation are not in alignment: finance budgets are typically based \non preceding allocations and follow the chart of accounts, while program budgets use their own \naccounting  structure  often  with  inaccurate  costing, making  it  difficult to  link  and  sequence \nresources and track financial progress by program. The Ministry of Finance (MOF) has introduced \na \u2018double entry\u2019 accounting system for the health sector to align program and financial budgets, \nbut the situation has been complicated by channeling of non-salary NHI operational expenditures \nthrough the NHIB, accompanied by an unclear division of labor between MOH and NHIB.26 \n \n11.  ADB support. Asian Development Bank (ADB) engagement with the Lao PDR health \nsector is long-standing and wide-ranging (Figure). ADB began supporting hospitals and health \ncenters in 1995, starting in two northern provinces and eventually scaling up to eight provinces. \nSince 2001, ADB has been closely involved in communicable disease control and regional health \nsecurity. The Health Sector Development Program was ADB\u2019s first sector development program \nfor the Lao PDR health sector, and emphasized health systems strengthening for planning and \nfinancing, access to MNCH, and human resource quality.27 Prior to subprogram 1, ADB supported \nHSR  through  policy  advisory  technical  assistance  (TA)  that  established  a  foundation  for \ngovernance  reforms,  and  draft  plans  for  human  resource  development  and  financial \nmanagement.28 In addition to a policy-based loan, subprogram 1 provided a TA loan for equipment \nand training that was implemented in subprogram 2 (footnote 4). An additional grant supports \ncapacity building for key MOH departments carrying out HSR.29 In public sector management, \nADB support has focused on creating medium-term budget frameworks (including for the health \nsector),  improving  fiscal  transfer  from  the  central  government  to  provincial  and  district \ngovernments, building civil service capacity, strengthening national oversight institutions, and \nfacilitating private sector development.30 \n   \n                                                \n23 This is mostly revenue from users at facilities. \n24 National Health Accounts Report, 2012\u20132016 (footnote 19, above). The Ministry of Finance Gazette 2017 shows the \nbudget allocation for health was about KN1.28 trillion in FY2015 and KN1.54 trillion in FY2017. \n25 J. Hennicot. 2017.

Lessons. Past programs have been strongly aligned with MOH policies, and therefore \nhighly relevant, but development partners need to go beyond information sharing and better \ncoordinate  activities  under  the  government\u2019s  single  reform  agenda.  To  this  end,  under \nsubprogram 2, partners are engaging through technical working groups to jointly achieve the \nHSRS pillars. Past interventions reveal constrained provincial managerial capacity and limited \ncoordination between different levels of the health system. Long-term engagement through \nsubprograms 1 and 2 and complementary TA enable improved understanding of the informal and \nformal rules of the political economy that shape reform processes, and support for building \nownership and appropriate leadership skills at the central and provincial levels. Policy reforms by \nnature take time and require continuous engagement and flexibility to respond rapidly to policy \nchanges. Past projects also show that better cost-sharing mechanisms are needed to make health \ncare more affordable for vulnerable groups. Subprogram 2 specifically targets the poor, women, \nand children under 5. It also supports NHI, which insures the population from catastrophic \nexpenditures. \n \nB.  Policy Reform and ADB\u2019s Value Addition \n \n13.  Program alignment with the Health Sector Reform Strategy. The effect of the reform \nis improved health service coverage, particularly for the poor, mothers, and children.31 Both \nsubprograms were designed to support the five pillars under the HSRS: (i) health financing; (ii) \nhuman resources for health; (iii) governance, organization, and management; (iv) health service \ndelivery; and (v) information, monitoring, and evaluation. Specific activities are envisioned across \nfour plan periods up to 2030 (subprogram 2 is synchronized with the 8th HSDP). Subprogram 2 \nadvances reforms initiated under subprogram 1, with the government accomplishing 17 policy \nactions (11 triggers and 6 milestones, Appendix 4). The government introduced NHI between the \ndesign and implementation of subprogram 1 (August 2013\u2013July 2015) and the preparation of \nsubprogram 2 (August 2015\u2013March 2018). The HEF and FMNCH programs were subsumed \nunder  the  NHI  program.  The  government  will  ensure\u2014through  decrees,  guidelines,  and \nstrategies\u2014that benefits provided to the poor, mothers, and children under 5 under NHI equal or \n                                                \n31 The program team revised two targets in the design and monitoring framework: the target about population coverage \nwas revised to reflect the policy shift from HEF to NHI, and the target about midwives was revised to avoid repetition. \n ", "6 \nexceed those provided under HEF and FMNCH, and are provided at no cost.32 Development \npartners have harmonized efforts to meet HSR goals. ADB has taken the lead on the first three \npillars, and other partners have prioritized pillars 4 and 5. The World Bank disburses funds based \non results in service delivery and information monitoring and evaluation. The Japan International \nCooperation Agency, the European Union, WHO, Luxembourg Development Agency, and the \nSwiss Red Cross support financing, human resources, and service delivery.33 \n \n14.  ADB\u2019s value addition. ADB\u2019s comparative advantage and value addition for the program \nlies in its cross-sector approach that addresses two themes\u2014public finance and governance\u2014\nthat are essential for HSR. ADB\u2019s past support to the Lao PDR for public sector and financial \nmanagement helps it understand the challenges inherent in public sector management reform \nprocesses that affect the health sector. As a development bank, ADB can provide significant fiscal \nand technical support to address the Lao PDR\u2019s macroeconomic situation. ADB continues to \nsupport domestic policymaking in the health sector and provided critical inputs to the design of \nHSRS and NHI under both subprograms. ADB is also a strong contributor to development partner \nforums. Past health projects targeting the supply side and more recent projects on communicable \ndisease control and health security complement the program, and align with ADB\u2019s strategic vision \non poverty reduction, gender equity, human resource development, and regional cooperation; \nand its emphasis on governance and long-term support.34 \n \n15.  Reform area 1: Health sector reform process improved. Under subprogram 1, the \ngovernment established the National Commission on Health Sector Reform chaired by the vice-\nprime minister. The commission oversees reform progress and approves annual reports and \nplans. MOH drafted road maps to strengthen human resources and financial management for \nhealth. To advance these reforms under subprogram 2, the cabinet is fully functional as the \nsecretariat  for  the  national  commission.  To  aid  health  sector  coordination,  the  secretariat \nestablished an HSR coordination unit with 12 staff in August 2017 and HSR committees with focal \npoints to jointly manage HSR and decentralization reforms (footnote 17). MOH has finalized the \n2018 annual operational plan for the health sector, which integrates the 2018 HSR plan presented \nat the annual national commission meeting in December 2017. The Minister of Health has \napproved road maps on human resource development and financial management, which set clear \ndirections for HSR. \n \n16.  Reform area 2: Implementation of free health care for the poor, mothers, and \nchildren improved. Under subprogram 1, the government expanded the number of HEF and \nFMNCH beneficiaries.35 By 2014, HEF covered 43% of poor families and FMNCH services had \nbeen initiated in 88 of 146 districts.36 The government began phasing out HEF and FMNCH during \nsubprogram 2, with resources instead directed to NHI, with implementation guidelines for the \nschemes harmonized to facilitate a smooth transition to NHI. MOF has created a fund to finance \n                                                \n32 Summary Assessment of Policy Actions under Subprogram 2 (accessible from the list of linked documents in \nAppendix 2). The assessment outlines the original indicative policy action, status of accomplishments, and \nformulation of policy actions for subprogram 2.

The strategy includes health under its strategic priority to enhance human \ndevelopment. \n35 In subprogram 1, the reform area was to improve the implementation of the HEF and FMNCH schemes. Given the \nchange in policy direction toward NHI, this reform area has been reworded. \n36 About 110,000 mothers, 300,000 children under 5, and 620,000 poor people (Government of the Lao PDR, MOH. \n2017. Key Features of the Official Social Health Protection Schemes in Lao PDR. Vientiane). \n ", "7 \nNHI to ensure continued provision of free health care for the poor, mothers, and children under 5; \nas of January 2018, NHI had begun in 141 districts, and will cover 80% of the population (5.65 \nmillion) by June 2019.37 MOH conducted a financial management assessment of NHI in 2017 to \nrevise NHI\u2019s implementation guidelines and evaluate reforms under both subprograms. \n \n17.  Reform area 3: Health human resource management capacity strengthened. Under \nsubprogram 1, the government engaged 4,000 people (many of whom were midwives) to the \nhealth workforce in 2014. MOH also implemented a provincial health personnel management \ninformation system (HPMIS) to improve human resource management and planning. MOH \ndefined quality standards for medical education institutions and approved competency standards \nfor medical professions, including dentistry, to be included in the training curriculum. Under \nsubprogram 2, MOH has improved the functionality of the HPMIS by developing an import module \nto transfer data from an online personnel management information system into the HPMIS. Data \ncan  now  be  aggregated  by  province,  district,  and  health  facility  for  better  planning  and \nmanagement. MOH also expanded the HPMIS to capture information on training, gender, and \nethnicity. Provincial health office staff have undergone training to use the HPMIS, and 12 \nprovincial health offices have formulated and are beginning to implement provincial workforce \ndevelopment plans to guide the training and deployment of staff in remote and hard-to-reach \nareas. This is particularly important for continued recruitment of midwives to help improve \nmaternal health; between subprogram 1 and 2, the number of health centers with midwives has \nmore than doubled (from 33% of health centers in 2012\u20132013 to more than 75.1% in 2016). In \naddition, MOH has issued decrees defining the licensing and registration process for health \nprofessionals and developing quality standards and requirements for the accreditation of medical \neducation  institutions.  The  newly  created  Health  Professionals\u2019  Council  oversees  the \nimplementation of these decrees. \n \n18.  Reform area 4: Health sector financial management system strengthened. Under \nsubprogram 1, MOH developed staff capacity in preparation for adopting a multiyear health sector \nbudget framework. MOH issued implementation guidelines to regulate the use and accounting of \nhealth facility user fees. To better understand resource mobilization and allocations in the health \nsector,  MOH  published  national  health  accounts  (NHAs)  for  FY2011  and  FY2012.  Under \nsubprogram 2, MOH has adopted the widely accepted unitary bookkeeping and reporting system \nto account for sources and uses of funds in health facilities. MOH has also established a budget \nexpenditure and disbursement monitoring system to document annual and quarterly expenditures \nand approved budgets. MOH has published NHAs for FY2013\u2013FY2016 and is building capacity \nto institutionalize NHA production in MOH\u2019s Department of Finance. Efforts are underway to better \nlink the finance and program budgets and report expenditures according to the chart of accounts \nand existing program codes. \n \n19.  Post-program partnership framework. The post-program partnership framework (P3F) \nprovides a common understanding and proposes possible actions to be supported by ADB and \nother development partners following subprogram 2 (last column of Appendix 4). Broadly, P3F \nwill sustain the reforms initiated under the program: subprogram 2 supports the beginning of \nphase 2 of the HSRS (2016\u20132020), and P3F sets out support for the end of phase 2 and the \nbeginning of phase 3 (2021\u20132025). Under P3F, MOH will expand access to health facilities and \nbenefits to include more health promotion, prevention, and rehabilitative interventions, with a \nfocus  on  quality  and  use  of  performance-based  incentives.  The  government  will  continue \nproviding free service delivery for the poor, mothers, and children under 5 under NHI and will \n                                                \n37 Based on projected total population of 7.06 million by 2019. United Nations Population Division. World Population \nProspects 2017. \n ", "8 \nreduce OOP payments to 30% of total health expenditure by 2025. All health facilities will have \nthe appropriate number and level of skilled health workers who are motivated, trained, and \nproperly incentivized. The HSRS aims to increase domestic health expenditure to 13% of GGE \nby 2025, with adequate budget allocations for women to ensure universal access to sexual and \nreproductive health services in accordance with SDG targets 3.7 and 5.6. ADB will provide TA \nsupport for NHIB capacity development, including carrying out an expanded NHI evaluation; \nworkforce plan implementation in all provinces; and the further strengthening of the MOF \u2018double \nentry\u2019 accounting system. ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, 2017\u20132020 for the Lao PDR fully \naligns with subprogram 2 and P3F, with continuing support for HSRS and the attainment of UHC \nin poor provinces, border areas, and economic corridors (footnote 34). \n \nC.  Impacts of the Reform \n \n20.  Economic and financial. Both the Lao PDR and ADB recognize that improving access \nto health care without financial hardship cannot be achieved without significant government \nresources. Quantifying expected benefits accurately is difficult, but reforms especially in financial \nmanagement, health care financing, and human resources, which are widely perceived to be key \nbottlenecks for improving quality, efficiency, and equity, are strongly supported and will improve \nhealth service coverage and ultimately health outcomes, particularly for vulnerable groups. The \nprogram impact assessment estimates that support provided under subprograms 1 and 2 equal \n10.2%\u201313.1% of annual health sector capital requirements during 2016\u20132020.38   \n \nD.  Development Financing Needs and Budget Support \n \n21.  The government has requested a grant not exceeding $30 million from ADB\u2019s Special \nFunds  resources  (Asian  Development  Fund)  to  help  finance  the  program.39  The  size  of \nsubprogram 2 reflects the government\u2019s financing needs, the strength of and commitment to the \nreform program, and the development expenditure arising from the reform program. The policy-\nbased  grant  considers  the  International  Monetary  Fund\u2019s  assessment  of  the  Lao  PDR\u2019s \nmacroeconomic constraints, including a large current account deficit and high external debt \nstock.40 The 8th NSEDP states that the government\u2019s capital requirements for development during \n2016\u20132020 equal $5.7 billion\u2013$7.3 billion. Assuming health sector investment is equal to the \ngovernment budget expenditure on health (5.9%), capital requirements will equal $336 million\u2013\n$431 million. Figures from FY2014 (footnote 19) show development partners finance around 18% \nof health expenditure; subprogram 2 will contribute significantly to this total. The grant will be \nprovided in a single tranche and may be withdrawn upon grant effectiveness. \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n22.  The  executing  agency for the  program  is  MOH,  represented  by the Department  of \nPlanning  and  Cooperation.  As  the  executing  agency,  MOH  is  responsible  for  program \nimplementation, maintenance of all program records, and communicating with ADB on behalf of \n                                                \n38  Program Impact Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n39 The latest debt sustainability analysis classified the Lao PDR\u2019s debt distress as high risk, making the country eligible \nfor an Asian Development Fund grant. However, Lao PDR\u2019s per capita gross national income exceeds the \ninternational development association threshold, and the country will only be eligible for concessional lending from \n2019.

The MOH steering committee is chaired by the health minister and comprises \nvice-ministers  and  representatives  of  MOH  departments,  including  the  cabinet,  which  is \nresponsible for oversight of HSR implementation, and other ministries as requested. It provides \nguidance on program implementation. The implementation period of subprogram 2 started in \nAugust 2015 and will end in March 2018. The grant closing date is 31 December 2018.41 The \nproceeds  of  the  policy-based  grant  will  be  withdrawn  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan \nDisbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from time to time). \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \n23.  Environment.  ADB  has  reviewed  subprogram  2\u2019s  policy  actions\u2014which  target \ninstitutional arrangements, human resources, budget allocation, and financial management\u2014and \nfound  no  anticipated  environmental  impacts  or  requirements  for  mitigation  measures. \nConsequently, the program is classified category C for the environment. MOH prepared an \nenvironmental assessment and review framework for subprogram 1 (minor renovations of existing \nhealth centers were originally planned). No physical works were implemented under subprogram \n1, however, and none are envisaged under subprogram 2, and an environmental assessment and \nreview framework is thus not required. \n \n24.  Involuntary  resettlement.  MOH  prepared  a resettlement screening and  involuntary \nresettlement framework in preparation for subprogram 1 to address impacts associated with \nplanned  refurbishment  of  health  facilities.  ADB  reviewed  policy  actions  carried  out  under \nsubprogram 2 and found no new health facility construction or refurbishment activities and no \nplanned land acquisition or involuntary resettlement. A resettlement framework is therefore not \nrequired for subprogram 2 and the program is classified category C for involuntary resettlement \nunder ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). \n \n25.  Ethnic groups. The program is classified category B for indigenous peoples because of \nthe program\u2019s potential positive impacts. MOH prepared an indigenous people\u2019s plan, with \ncorresponding mitigation measures, for subprogram 1 and the TA loan to assess the program \nactivities\u2019 potential impact on ethnic groups and to ensure that ethnic groups benefited equally \nfrom the program activities. MOH updated the indigenous people\u2019s plan and subsumed it into the \nmatrix of potential environmental and social impacts and measures for subprogram 2 to reflect \nkey issues, policy actions, potential impacts, and mitigating actions.42 Further, MOH revised the \nindigenous people\u2019s plan during the midterm review of the TA loan in August 2017 and will \ncontinue to implement it during the TA loan term. \n \n26.  Gender. Both subprograms 1 and 2 are classified gender equity as a theme as they \npromote and contribute to achieving gender equality by enhancing women\u2019s access to health \nservices. Subprogram 2 continues to prioritize support for poor provinces with ethnic minority \npopulations that typically have greater maternal health care needs. MOH has initiated policies for \nincreasing access to NHI, including FMNCH services, and the number of health centers with at \nleast one community midwife for safe delivery. The policy matrix in Appendix 4 includes gender-\nrelated policy actions. ADB revised the gender action plan, supported by the TA loan, during the \nmidterm review to better reflect the current context (e.g., alignment with new NHI scheme) and to \nimprove its quality by rewording some targets.43 Gender action plan achievements include the \n                                                \n41 List of Ineligible Items (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n42 Indigenous People\u2019s Plan and Matrix of Potential Environmental and Social Impacts and Measures (accessible from \nthe list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n43 Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "10 \nfollowing: (i) more than 75.1% of 1,017 health centers have at least one midwife;44 (ii) MOH \ndeveloped a detailed road map guiding preparation of a national strategy to promote gender \nequality in the health sector; and (iii) workforce development plans that include action points on \ngender and equity policies to support women\u2019s employment, placement, retention, promotion, and \ncapacity  development  in  the  health  sector  were  formulated.
