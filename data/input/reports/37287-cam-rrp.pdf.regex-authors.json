An initial environmental examination was undertaken \nAssessment  and  an  environmental  assessment  and  review  framework  was \nprepared. \n   \nProject Description  The Tonle Sap Lowlands Rural Development Project (the Project) \nwill support 40 communes in the development and upgrading of \nrural infrastructure through a combination of community led and \nexecuted  activities;  and  government  agency  implemented \ninfrastructure development in the provinces of Kampong Chhang, \nKampong Thom, and Pursat in the Tonle Sap basin (Component \n1). It will also assist in the creation of new and improved livelihood \nopportunities  in  these  communes  (Component 2);  and  will \nstrengthen the institutional capacity of commune, provincial, and \nnational organizations (Component 3).  \n \nIt will benefit people in the communes on the lowlands that lie \noutside the buffer zone surrounding the Tonle Sap Lake. Poverty \nrates in these communes average 38%, which is slightly higher \nthan the national average of 36%. About 50% of villages in the \nselected communes have 40\u201360% of households living below the \nnational poverty line, with peak levels about 80% of households in \nKampong Chhnang. \n   \nRationale  Agriculture accounts for one third of Cambodia\u2019s gross domestic \nproduct (GDP) and is the main source of livelihood for nearly 80% \nof  the  population.  Many  of  the  people  in  the  lowland  rural \ncommunities that surround Tonle Sap depend on agriculture, but \nthey are vulnerable to shocks. Accidents and ill health, seasonal \nshortages  of  rainfall  (especially  at  the  beginning  of  the  rainy \nseason), seasonal shortages of water (especially drinking water \nduring  the  dry  season),  and  food  shortages  resulting  from \nshortfalls in the rice harvest (caused by an unreliable supply of \nwater at the start and finish of both wet and dry rice crops) all \nincrease the vulnerability of people in the lowlands.  \n \nDespite the richness of the lake, poverty rates in the basin are \nhigher than in the country as a whole. Over 50% of households do \nnot grow enough rice to meet their needs. Seasonal migration \nfrom lowland communities into the lake buffer zone, to supplement \ndiets,  risks  overexploiting  the  lake  and  exacerbating  existing \n ", "ii   \npressures on its resources.  \n \nIrrigation  is  one  of  the  16  strategic  priorities  for  national \ndevelopment,  as  a  remedial  measure  to  earlier  developments \nwhich tend to be poorly designed or constructed on a scale that is \ndifficult  for  communal  maintenance.  Many  schemes  now  need \nurgent  upgrading  to  support  the  needs  of  the  communities. \nFurthermore,  transport  and  water  supply  and  sanitation \ninfrastructure also require upgrading. Adoption of new agricultural \npractices  and  opportunities  for  off-farm  employment  in  the \nlowlands  are  restricted  by  limited  vocational  education,  poor \nfinancial services, and poor rural infrastructure.  \n \nThe proposed Asian Development Fund (ADF) IX combined loan \nand grant will enable the Project to focus on community-driven \ndevelopment,  linked  with  provincial  level  infrastructure \ninvestments and creation of new opportunities for on and off-farm \nemployment  to  reduce  poverty  and  vulnerability  in  one  of  the \npoorest regions of Cambodia. \n   \nImpact and Outcome  The  Project  will  improve  the  livelihoods  of  households  in \n40 lowlands communes located from the outer limit of the buffer \nzone to the foothills of the upper watershed area. It will improve \naccess  to  important  production  factors  in  three  provinces \nsurrounding  Tonle  Sap  and  diversify  income-generating \nopportunities. \n   \nProject Investment Plan   The  total  project  cost  is  estimated  at  $24  million  equivalent, \nincluding contingencies, taxes, and duties.  \n   \nFinancing Plan   ($ million) \n \nItem  Total  Percent \nAsian Development Bank Loan  10.10  42.00 \nAsian Development Bank Grant  9.90  41.00 \nGovernment  3.00  12.50 \nCommune Beneficiaries  1.00  4.50 \n    Total  24.00  100.00 \n \n   \n  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  will  provide  a  loan  of \n$10,100,000 equivalent in SDR and a grant of $9,900,000 from its \nADF. \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  Until 30 June 2015 \n   \nEstimated Project  31 December 2014 \nCompletion Date \n   \nExecuting Agency  Ministry of Water Resources and Meteorology (MOWRAM) \n   \nImplementation  Several government agencies (at national and subnational levels) \nArrangements  will be directly engaged in implementation, including MOWRAM; \nMinistry of Rural Development (MRD); and Ministry of Agriculture, \nForestry and Fisheries (MAFF). Provincial Local Administration ", "  iii\nUnits (PLAUs) of Ministry of Interior (MOI) in collaboration with \ncommune councils will facilitate community-led developments.  \n \nEffective communication among these agencies will be essential, \nso  a  project  steering  committee  with  membership  drawn  from \nparticipating agencies and chaired by the secretary of state of \nMOWRAM  is  proposed  to  oversee  implementation.  Provincial \ncoordination  committees  in  participating  provinces  will  facilitate \ninteragency coordination. Project management in Phnom Penh \nwill  consist  of  a  project  director  (senior  professional  staff, \nMOWRAM)  and  four  deputy  directors  provided  by  MOWRAM, \nMAFF, MOI and MRD. \n   \nProcurement  Civil  works,  goods,  and  related  services  will  be  procured  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as \namended from time to time).  \n   \nConsulting Services  Consultants  will  be  selected  and  engaged  in  accordance  with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended \nfrom time to time). The project management office (PMO) will be \nresponsible for the recruitment of a consulting firm using quality \nand cost-based selection (80:20). A total of 489 person-months of \nconsulting  services  will  be  required  (55  person-months \ninternational and 434 person-months national). Total consulting \ninputs include individual consultants to be recruited for specified \ntasks\u20149  person-months  for  an  international  consultant  to \ncoordinate Tonle Sap Initiative activities and 11 person-months of \npost-harvest  management  specialists  (2  person-months \ninternational, 9 person-months national). \n   \nProject Benefits and  The Project will provide direct and indirect economic benefits to \nBeneficiaries  about  68,000  households  with  a  population  of  about \n354,000 persons in 40 communes selected in the three provinces \naround  the  lake.  It  will  improve  extension  services  to  9,600 \nhectares  (ha)  that  will  benefit  from  irrigation  infrastructure \ndevelopment. In addition to irrigation, benefits will be derived from \ninvestments  in  small-scale  village  infrastructure,  increasing \nagricultural productivity and off-farm business development.  \n \nThe  Project  will  generate  substantial  improvements  to  the \nlivelihoods of people in communes surrounding the buffer zone of \nTonle Sap Lake, resulting in environmental benefits in the buffer \nand core zones by reducing the need for these communities to \nenter the buffer zone to make up for shortfalls in food production \nin the dry season. Creation of new jobs and livelihood activities in \nthe lowland communities will reduce pressure on agricultural lands \nand diminish the incidence of temporary migration to the lake and \nmore distant locations. The Project will increase social capital by \nstrengthening  the  capacity  for  communal  action,  increasing \nwomen\u2019s participation, and providing communal infrastructure.  \n   \n ", "iv   \nRisks and Assumptions  The Project includes measures to avoid or mitigate environmental, \ninstitutional, and financial risks. The principal assumption is that \nthe Government will continue the program of decentralization and \ndeconcentration  for  strengthening  the  capacity  for  decision \nmaking  at  the  local  level.  Recent  governance  risks  identified \ninclude  (i) procurement;  (ii)  purchase  of  expendable \nmaterials/services;  and  (iii)  quality  assurance  of  works  being \nsubject to risks of corrupt practices, with existing financial and \naccountability  systems  not  providing  expected  standards  of \nfiduciary control. The Government is committed to public financial \nmanagement  reform.  ADB  has  previously  assisted  with  public \nfinancial management in the Ministry of Education,  Youth and \nSport,, Ministry of Health, and Ministry of Economy and Finance \n(MEF). The Government has requested ADB technical assistance \n(TA)  to  support  improved  public  financial  management  in \nMOWRAM,  MAFF,  and  MRD.  The  proposed  TA  is  being \nprocessed by ADB for approval in 2008. The project consulting \nservices  include  inputs  for  procurement  and  quality  assurance \nspecialists  at  provincial  level.  ADB  and  the  Government  have \nagreed a good governance framework that will guide executing \nand implementing agency staff during project implementation. \n \nIt is assumed that effective rural financial services will be available \nin  all  project  areas  through  existing  commercial  banks  and \nlicensed microfinance institutions. Active coordination between the \noperations of financial service providers and project interventions \nwill enable project beneficiaries to access the required services, \nincluding micro-credit loans.  \n \nThe Project will involve activities implemented through different \nministries,  so  the  project  steering  committee  and  provincial \ncoordination committees will provide guidance and leadership in \nensuring effective coordination of work programs. \n \n   \n \n ", "103o  30'E 105o  30'N 103 o 00'E LAO PE1O07P o 0L0E'E\u2019S\nDEMOCRATIC\nREPUBLIC\nCAMBODIA THAILAND\nTHAILAND ODDAR  MEANCHEY\n14o  00'N 14o  00'N\nTONLE SAP LOWLANDS MBEAANNTCEHAEYY PREAH   VIHEAR STUNG TRENG RATANAKIRI\nSIEM  REAP\nRURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT\nPoipet SisophMoBnEAANNTCEHAEYY SIEM  REAP TPbRenEgA MH e  aVnIcHhEeAyR PAILINBATTAMBANPGURSATTSoanple KCOHMHNPAONNGGCKOTMHAPOOMNGMKOMBPONOMeGkong R.KRDATIEIMAONDULKIRI\nCHAM\nTa Lam PHNOM PENH\n13 o 30'N Mongkol Borey Sambur Prasat 13 o 30'N 1T1Gho  u0a0il'lfN a onfd KOH  KONG KOSMPPEOUNGTAKEKOANDALVPERNEYGRSIVEANYG VIET NA1M1o  00'N\nKAMPOT\nSiem Reap 103S o IH0A0N'EOUKVILLE KEP Bassac R.

I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nloan, and (ii) a proposed grant, both to the Kingdom of Cambodia for the Tonle Sap Lowlands \nRural Development Project.  \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n1.  Tonle Sap Lake and Lowlands \n2.  Tonle Sap is the largest freshwater lake in Southeast Asia, covering an area of 2,500\u2013\n3,000 square kilometers (km2) in the dry season. Tonle Sap River, which drains the lake, \nreverses its flow in the wet season when the waters of the Mekong River flow into the lake to \ninundate 10,000\u201316,000 km2 for months. The fisheries of the lake, together with the flooded \nforest and agricultural lands of the inundated area, have underpinned human activity since \nancient times.1 Tonle Sap and the associated heritage of Angkor have defined Cambodia's \nidentity. Today, the land, water, and biotic resources of Tonle Sap directly benefit 40% of the \npopulation of the provinces adjoining the lake; and underpin food security and employment \nelsewhere. The lake benefits the lower Mekong basin as a feeding and spawning area for \n \nmigratory fish, and is of global significance for biodiversity conservation.  \n \n3.  The lowland areas of Tonle Sap basin are the flat low-lying areas that extend beyond the \nbiosphere reserve buffer zone to the foothills of the upper watershed. There is no precise \nboundary between the lowland and the buffer zone, but livelihood activities in the lowland area \nare predominantly based on a single wet season rice crop. The lowland areas are characterized \nby soils of low fertility, a climate of pronounced wet and dry seasons, and few income-earning \nactivities or off-farm employment opportunities.2 \n \n2.  Threats to Tonle Sap \n4.  In Cambodia, high population growth is increasing the number of people to feed, and \nconsumptive use of the Tonle Sap basin\u2019s natural resources is intense.3 Major threats to the \nTonle Sap include overexploitation of fisheries and wildlife resources, particularly through the \n \nfishing lot system,conversion of the flooded forest to agriculture, and collection of fuelwood from \n \nthe remaining flooded forest.Widespread deforestation in the watersheds is destroying habitats, \n \nimpairing water and soil quality, and increasing siltation rates. As a result, despite the richness \nof the lake, indicators of poverty in the basin are more severe than in the country as a whole. \nSeasonal migration from lowland communities to the buffer zone and the lake\u2014to supplement \ndiets and exploit lake resources\u2014exacerbates existing pressures on these resources. \n \n                                                 \n1  These resources are believed to contribute more to national food security in Cambodia than in the other countries \nof the Mekong. (Their contribution to gross domestic product [GDP] has been reassessed at 16%. The annual \nvalue of the catch is estimated at $200 million\u2013$300 million). \n2  Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2005. Technical Assistance to the Kingdom of Cambodia for Preparing the Tonle \nSap Lowland Stabilization Project. Manila (TA No. 4756-CAM, approved on 21 December, for $1,000,000).  \n3 \u201cThe rapid degradation of natural resources in the Basin has resulted in high poverty incidence in the region and \nreinforced the pressure on the lake\u2019s resources. As a result, the lake is facing a serious threat of over-exploitation \nand its ecosystem has turned quite fragile. If this problem is not addressed decisively and soon, Cambodia could \nface an environmental disaster of enormous proportions.\u201d Prime Minister Hun Sen. 2007. Keynote speech at the \nopening of Tonle Sap Forum, Phnom Penh, 5\u20136 March 2007. \n \n ", "2\n   \n3.  Poverty and Vulnerability \n5.  The rural sector in Cambodia accounts for the majority of population, production, and \nemployment in the Cambodian economy as well as the great majority of poor people. The sector \ncontinues  to  struggle  under  the  consequences  of  war-torn  infrastructure  and  displaced \ncommunities. Many of the people in the rural communities in the lowlands that surround Tonle \nSap remain vulnerable to shocks. These include (i) shortages of rainfall (especially at the \nbeginning of the rainy season); and (ii) shortages of water, especially drinking water during the \ndry season, and for cropping at the start and finish of both wet and dry rice crops\u2014leading to \nshortfalls in the rice harvest. On average, over 50% of rural people do not grow enough rice to \nmeet their needs.  \n \n6.  In national terms, the Tonle Sap region has the highest incidence of poverty (38%), the \nsecond highest average population density (52 persons per km2), and 31% of the population \n(Table A1.1). About 50% of villages have 40\u201360% of households living below the poverty line, \nwith a peak of 80% in parts of Siem Reap and Kampong Chhnang. The poor, as defined by low \nincomes and low consumption bundles, generally tends to have less access to productive \nresources. For example, poorer villages tend to be located where there is less access to natural \nresources or where there are lower quality natural resources (e.g., less productive land in areas \nmore vulnerable to flood and drought). Cambodia Human Development Report 1999 reports \nthat poorer villages have less access to markets (14% of villages have a market), infrastructure \n(43% of villages have access to electricity and 23% have access to piped water), economic \nservices (11% of villages have a bank or credit organization and 4% have an agricultural \nextension worker), and political power (the average village is 9 km from the district town). As a \nresult, poorer villages tend to depend more on agriculture activities whereas richer villages are \nmore diversified, with trading as the most important economic activity. About 90% of the poor \nbelong to households that rely on agriculture as the primary source of income. These people \noften suffer from basic food insecurity, manifested as seasonal hunger in the months prior to the \nmajor harvest, sometimes leading to a cycle of indebtedness that ends in loss of farm assets \nsuch as land. The poor tend to have larger families living under one roof, with younger children \nand higher dependency ratios (nonworking to working household members). \n \n7.  Eighty-five percent of Cambodians are dependent on agriculture and non-timber forest \nextraction for the major part of their livelihoods, although these activities only account for about \none third of gross domestic product (GDP). Opportunities in other sectors, while promising, are \ninadequate to absorb the 250,000 new entrants into the job market each year, and there are \nsignificant opportunities to improve the productivity and sustainability of traditional activities in \nthe  rural  sector.  However,  productive  infrastructure,  technology,  markets,  and  commercial \nservices remain weak in the rural sector; and agricultural output retains the volatility and \nweather dependence characteristic of a subsistence production pattern.  \n \n8.  Women  and  ethnic  minorities  are  vulnerable.  Although  women  have  rights  to  land \nownership, they have less access than men to credit, paid employment, education, and health \nservices. They also have fewer opportunities for self-development or participation in community \ndecision making4 since Khmer tradition ascribes a passive role to women. Nevertheless, the \ngender division of labor is changing overall: women and men play progressively interchangeable \nroles because women are increasingly called on to meet household needs as men migrate to \nseek paid employment. Ethnic minorities living in the Tonle Sap basin are the Vietnamese and \nMuslim Cham; and small communities of indigenous peoples such as Kuy, Por and Phnong. \nThe indigenous peoples are the only ethnic minorities that are officially recognized. Even though \nmost of the Vietnamese were born in Cambodia, they are not Khmer people and are classified \n                                                 \n4  Currently, only about 3\u20135% of women participate in committees such as farmer water user groups (FWUGs). \nHowever, the Ministry of Water Resources and Meteorology (MOWRAM) has set a target for women's participation \nin decision-making bodies at commune level of a minimum of 10% by 2010. \n ", "3 \nas  immigrants.  This  status  limits  their  participation  in  community-based  natural  resource \nmanagement. The Vietnamese are further deprived by lack of property rights and language \nbarriers. The Cham experience less severe segregation than other minority communities, but all \nethnic minorities are disadvantaged because of inadequate representation at management and \nlegislative levels. There are also many displaced or disabled persons, who suffer from poverty \nand other forms of social deprivation to a greater extent than the rest of the population. \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n9.  Agricultural  Water  Management.  Agriculture accounts for one third of Cambodia\u2019s \nGDP and is the main source of livelihood for nearly 80% of the population. It is widely believed \nthat  lack  of  availability  of  sufficient  water  is  the  critical  constraint  on  rice  production.  The \nGovernment\u2019s Rectangular Strategy for Growth, Employment, Equity and Efficiency (2004\u2013\n2008) identifies irrigation as one of 16 strategic priorities for national development. However, \nabout 80% of irrigation schemes in Cambodia were built during the Khmer Rouge era, and even \nschemes built prior to this were often altered at that time. Such schemes tend to be poorly \ndesigned and were constructed on a large scale that is difficult for communal maintenance. \nSome never operated and other better-designed systems that worked previously have failed \nbecause  of  lack  of  maintenance  (Appendix  1). 5  Inventories  provided  by  the  Provincial \nDepartment of Water Resources and Meteorology (PDWRAM) in provinces in the Tonle Sap \nbasin list 200 existing water management/irrigation schemes in different states of disrepair, \nvarying in size from about 10 hectares (ha) to 13,000 ha. Many of the small-scale schemes are \nsubsections  of  large  schemes,  but  few  are  functioning  effectively  because  of  inadequate \nstructures,  land  leveling,  field  bunds,6 and  drainage,  combined  with  poor  crop  husbandry. \nSeveral large schemes in the project area have been rehabilitated in recent years or are being \nupgraded at present, but still lack secondary and tertiary systems to provide effective irrigation.  \n \n10.  Rural Roads. Rural infrastructure in Cambodia is still far from adequate because of \nseveral decades of war and the Government\u2019s lack of resources. Despite having received \nsubstantial external assistance (Appendix 2), the rural road network is still poor, resulting in high \ntransport costs and restricted access to markets. Improving access to production factors and \ninputs, as well as to markets and market information (especially for smallholders), is a key factor \nin turning agriculture into the driving force of pro-poor growth. In some cases, roads proposed \nfor rehabilitation also function as embankments to retain water for crops.  \n \n11.  Opportunities for New Rural Livelihoods. Economically, Cambodia is at a crossroads \nand a major effort is needed to focus on agriculture as the main driver of broad-based and pro-\npoor growth. While food security and better nutrition continue to be core sector development \ngoals,  a  move  toward  commercialization  is  required  to  create  economic  opportunities  and \nenable the sector, especially small-scale farmers, to benefit from new economic activities. Value \nchain analyses indicate that the largest losses to agricultural producers occur in post-harvest \nstorage,  processing,  and  marketing.  Numerous  obstacles  make  a  transition  from  low-level \nsubsistence agriculture difficult. However, improved agricultural technologies and post-harvest \nvalue  addition,  including  agro-processing  enterprises,  offer  new  opportunities  for  rural \nemployment. Rural off-farm activities and the integration of agriculture in a rural, private sector \nled development framework are needed. \n \n12.  Rural Financial Services. Capacity building and training can prepare individuals and \ngroups to adopt new on-farm and off-farm enterprises. However, without access to appropriate \nfinancial services, the rural poor is unable to take up these opportunities to increase household \nincome. Numerous microfinance institutions (MFIs) are operating in the Tonle Sap area, so it is \nnot necessary to set up a new financial organization to provide financial services (including \n                                                 \n5 Halcrow, W.1994.

(April).   \n6  Field bunds are the embankments around paddy fields. \n ", "4\n   \naccess to savings; credits for micro, small, and medium borrowers; remittances; and money \ntransfer) to the project area. However, access to and use of formal financial services in rural \nareas7 remains limited; and constrains the use of knowledge about more advanced farming \ntechniques, new markets, and business opportunities. Many MFIs tend to specialize in restricted \nareas in a few provinces, so outreach is limited in more remote rural regions. This results in \npoor delivery of financial services, and unrealized potential in agriculture and the rural economy \nbecause of the lack of access to seasonal working capital for crop production and off-farm \nenterprise development. Expansion of outreach programs will require innovative approaches to \nbusiness skills development in cooperation with financial service providers. \n \n1.  The Government\u2019s Response \n13.  The National Strategic Development Plan (NSDP), 2006\u20132010, is the formal means of \nimplementing the Government\u2019s Rectangular Strategy. It sets national priorities of alleviating \npoverty and enhancing economic growth. Enhancement of the agricultural sector is emphasized \nin order to increase agricultural productivity to boost the incomes of a large portion of the rural \npoor.  Immediate  objectives  include  increased  public  investment  in  rural  infrastructure, \nexpansion of extension services to support crop and livestock production, legal and regulatory \nreform to improve security of and access to agricultural inputs such as land and materials, \nimproved natural resource management, and increased availability of rural financial services. \nRehabilitation and construction of physical infrastructure is a second emphasis. This includes \nstructures for management of water resources and irrigation as one of its four components. The \nGovernment recognizes the importance of ensuring sustainability of irrigation infrastructure and \nis committed to (i) establishing and strengthening farmer water user committees (FWUC) and \nfarmer water user groups (FWUGs) to improve cooperation for operation and maintenance \n(O&M),  and  (ii)  the  introduction  of  an  irrigation  management  transfer  process  to  increase \nparticipatory  management  and  to  implement  a  rational  sharing  of  O&M  between  the \nGovernment and beneficiary communities.  \n \n14.  National Strategy for Agriculture and Water (2006\u20132010). The NSDP encourages \nministries  to  plan  in  a  coordinated  manner.  The  Government\u2019s  Strategic  Framework  for \nDecentralization and Deconcentration (D&D) reforms promotes a transfer of responsibilities and \nresources to subnational levels. During the next 5\u20136 years, the D&D reforms are expected to \nradically change the way in which government agencies function. In response to the NDSP, the \nNational Strategy for Agriculture and Water includes five main components: (i) strengthening \ninstitutional capacity for management for the agriculture and water sectors; (ii) improving food \nsecurity;  (iii)  improving  agriculture  and  agribusiness  (value  chain);  (iv)  improving  water \nresources, irrigation, and land management; and (v) improving agricultural and water research, \neducation, and extension.  \n \n15.  Development of water management is guided by the strategy of the Ministry of Water \nResources  and  Meteorology  (MOWRAM),  which  is  based  on  the  recognition  that  the \nGovernment is unable to finance and manage the large number of irrigation systems in the \ncountry. In 2000, the Government adopted the policy of participatory irrigation management and \ndevelopment, which mandates the establishment, empowerment, and transfer of responsibility \nof  the  management,  financing,  and  development  of  irrigation  systems  to  FWUCs  and \nsubordinate  FWUGs.  With  this  policy,  the  Government  shifted  its  emphasis  from  directly \nmanaging irrigation systems to building the capacity of FWUCs to manage their own systems.  \n \n2.  Lessons  \n16.  Numerous  development  agencies,  including  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB), \nprovide external assistance to the agriculture sector in Tonle Sap (Appendix 2). Key lessons \n                                                 \n7  Commercial banks and licensed MFIs are expanding their branch networks in provincial and district centers, \nmaking access less difficult for rural communities. \n ", "5 \nfrom ADB\u2019s experience in the sector in Cambodia include: (i) the decisive role of improved water \nresources management as a prerequisite to stabilizing and increasing agricultural production; \n(ii) the advantage, in the medium term, of a focus on small to medium-sized irrigation schemes \nwithin an integrated river-basin water management framework, where design and management \nare based on community participation; (iii) the crucial importance of a sustainable financing \nmechanism  for  maintenance  linked  to  increased  farm  incomes;  (iv)  the  need  for  pro-poor \nsustainable growth; and (v) improved access to livelihood assets. \n \n17.  An extended period of civil disruption has left Cambodia with a severe shortage of skilled \nand experienced professionals. The proposed executing and implementing agencies are no \nexception, and previous ADB projects have suffered implementation delays because of limited \nprofessional staff to lead the projects. Capacity building is required at all levels of the agencies, \nparticularly in project management, fiduciary control, and participatory development. However, \nthe Northern Rural Development Project and the CCDP (I&II) have successfully implemented \ninvestment  projects  in  a  decentralized  mode,  working  with  provincial  line  agencies  and \ncommune councils.8  \n \n18.  Efficiency  and  effectiveness  of  resource  management  in  the  Ministry  of  Rural \nDevelopment (MRD); Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (MAFF); and MOWRAM are \ncritical to successful rural development. Governance risk assessments9 of MRD and MOWRAM \nprovide a detailed diagnosis of key constraints in these institutions, and have underlined the \nneed for a substantial improvement in performance audit and fiduciary control processes and \ncapabilities.10 Work  on  the  Tonle  Sap  Sustainable  Livelihoods  Project  has  been  delayed \nbecause of slow recruitment of consulting services. 11 \n \n19.  The recently completed Agricultural Development Support to Seila (ADESS) Project \nfunded by the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), shows that a group \napproach can enable very poor farmers to adopt new or improved farming techniques and \ntechnologies. The ADESS Production Start-Up Program assisted extremely poor rural families \nto take the first step to break out of the poverty cycle. Although the results are encouraging, only \nabout  15%  of  poor  families  in  Pursat,  Banteay  Meanchey,  Battambang,  and  Siem  Reap \nbenefited from the project. Nevertheless, the approach provides a working model that can be \napplied more widely.  \n \n3.  ADB\u2019s Sector Objectives and Strategies \n20.  ADB\u2019s sector strategy, which is consistent with national strategies and other external \nassistance,  focuses  on:  (i)  improving  farmers\u2019  ability  to  raise  productivity,  diversify  toward \nhigher-value products, and connect to markets; (ii) improving the market environment for private \nagro-based  enterprise  growth;  and  (iii)  strengthening  institutional  capacity  for  competitive \n                                                 \n8 ADB. 2001.

The Tonle Sap Initiative (TSI) and associated Tonle Sap Basin \nStrategy12 form a core element of the sector strategy. Consistent with ADB\u2019s water policy,13 the \nTSI supports basin management organizations, and the worldwide trend toward managing land, \nwater, and biotic resources within a framework of basin planning. It involves an integrated \nprogram of technical assistance (TA) and investments to overcome binding constraints on \npoverty reduction while protecting vital ecosystem services in the basin. Without adequate \naccess  to  water,  human  health  deteriorates  and  long  periods  are  spent  on  nonproductive \nactivities such as collection of fuelwood and water.   \n \n21.  The TSI also gives a geographical focus to ADB\u2019s country strategy and program for \nCambodia, 2005\u20132009,14 forming the basis for effective and efficient setting of priorities and \nplanning assistance in Tonle Sap basin. It provides the framework for ADB assistance to the \nGovernment in its efforts to balance demands for accelerated development with international \ncommitments  to  protect  and  conserve  the  unique  environment  of  Tonle  Sap  basin.  The \nframework is a 15-year program of integrated TA and investment projects that provide support \nfor:  (i)  capacity  development  for  environmental  protect  and  development  management; \n(ii) strengthening of environmental protection by the Government, line agencies, and people \nliving in the basin; and (iii) investments in infrastructure, which open new opportunities that bring \nsustainable and inclusive growth to some of the poorest communities of one of the poorest \ncountries in the region. Cambodia is ranked 137 of 174 countries in the Human Development \nIndex (HDI) in the Human Development Report (1999).15  \n \n22.  The TSI is helping to (i) strengthen capacity for management of the core areas of the \nbiosphere reserve (Tonle Sap Environmental Management Project); (ii) improve water supply \nand sanitation in basin communities (Tonle Sap Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Project);16 \nand (iii) improve livelihood opportunities in buffer zone communes (Tonle Sap Sustainable \nLivelihoods Project). ADB is also financing the Northwest Irrigation Sector Project and the \nNorthwestern Rural Development Project. Future projects will include support for participatory \nmanagement  of  the  upper  watersheds  to  promote  improved  livelihoods,  protect  globally \nsignificant biodiversity, and sustain water resources for uses throughout the basin.  \n \n23.  The Project is the fourth investment project in the TSI and builds on approaches to \ncommunity  driven  development  being  developed  in  the  buffer  zone  under  the  Tonle  Sap \nSustainable  Livelihoods  Project  (footnote  11).  The  Project  will  combine  infrastructure \ninvestments, training, and capacity building to improve the performance of on-farm and off-farm \nenterprises with the objective of reducing the need for communities to migrate seasonally to \nexploit resources in the watershed and the buffer and core areas of the Great Lake.  \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n24.  The  Project  will  improve  livelihoods  in  three  provinces  in  the  Tonle  Sap  basin,  as \nsummarized in the project design and monitoring framework (Appendix 3). Rural communities \nwill use the improved coverage and quality of rural infrastructure (irrigation, roads, village level \npost-harvest facilities, and markets) and new opportunities resulting from the application of new \nskills in the pursuit of on-farm and off-farm enterprises to improve their livelihoods. \n                                                 \n12  ADB. 2006.

The Project will provide assistance to accelerate development in 40 selected communes \nin the Tonle Sap lowlands, which lie outside the buffer zone of the Tonle Sap biosphere reserve, \nto provide a stable base for improving rural incomes. This will reduce the need for people to \nmigrate into the buffer zone during the dry season. Commune and subproject selection criteria \nand processes are in Supplementary Appendix A.  \n \nB.  Outputs \n1.  Improvement of Rural Infrastructure \n26.  Without roads, essential agricultural inputs cannot be distributed effectively, agricultural \nyields remain low, and it is difficult and expensive to move produce to market. Therefore, rural \ninfrastructure  is  critical  for  improvement  of  rural  livelihoods,  including:  (i)  small-scale \ninfrastructure  developed  through  activities  managed  by  commune  councils  to  increase \ncommune and village assets; and (ii) larger-scale irrigation and rural road infrastructure to \nsupport increased economic activities, including on-farm and off-farm enterprises. Improved \ninfrastructure also attracts commercial financial services organizations necessary to support \nincreased economic activities and other essential social services such as health and education. \n \n  a.  Improvement and Development of Social Infrastructure \n \n27.  The Project will provide block grants in the form of the Commune Development Fund \n(CDF) to be used for the development, rehabilitation, or upgrading of small-scale infrastructure. \nSocial  infrastructure  needs  at  commune  and  village  level  will  be  identified  and  prioritized \nthrough the decentralized planning process used to prepare commune investment plans (CIP) \nsummarized in Supplementary Appendix B and included in the Project\u2019s annual work plan and \nbudget. Categories to be funded include civil works for: (i) village markets and other commercial \nsupport infrastructure; (ii) communal grain dryers; (iii) rural roads, including drainage, bridges, \nand  culverts\u2014linking  villages  within  the  commune  or  linking  inter-commune  roads;17 (iv) \nirrigation water conveyance and distribution facilities;18 (v) commune council buildings;19 (vi) \nvillage water supply and sanitation schemes;20 and (vii) classrooms at existing schools.21 Only \ninfrastructure that is accessible to the poor will be funded under the Project, which implies basic \nstructures with low O&M costs. Beneficiaries of communal grain dryers and irrigation systems \nwill contribute in cash or in kind to share a portion of the construction costs. The maximum cost \nof an individual activity funded through the CDF will be $20,000 with an average allocation of \nabout  $75,000  per  commune,  including  the  salary  and  overheads  of  commune  council \nsupporters, over the life of the Project. \n  \n                                                 \n17  Road  sections  that  extend  into  the  buffer  zone  of  Tonle  Sap  within  1,000  meters  will  not  be  eligible  for \nrehabilitation. \n18  The Project will assist FWUGs in the design and layout of field channel reticulation but earthworks will be \nperformed by volunteer labor. This will not require involuntary resettlement in principle. Land required for channels \nmay be through voluntary donation, if necessary. All farmers giving up land for the channel must confirm the \ndonation before construction/rehabilitation of the channel will commence. The Project will support construction of \nregulation and crossing structures identified in the CIP and funded through the CDF for improvement and \ndevelopment of social infrastructure. \n19 Commune  council  buildings  will  be  excluded  where  these  are  provided  through  the  Commune  Council \nDevelopment Project (footnote 8). \n20 Village water supply and sanitation schemes will only be accepted in communes not covered by the Tonle Sap \nRural Water Supply and Sanitation Project (footnote 16). \n21  Proposals for school classrooms will only be accepted in communes not covered by the Education Sector \nDevelopment Program.

The  Project  will  support:  (i)  rehabilitation  of  small  water  management  subprojects \n(typically less than 200 ha)22 covering a total of about 9,600 ha, with fully developed water \nreticulation below main canals to the field level; and (ii) formation, strengthening, and capacity \nbuilding of FWUGs and FWUCs for sustainable O&M.  \n \n29.  Beneficiary farmers will participate in the design of irrigation improvement schemes \nidentified in the commune investment plan; and will contribute23 to scheme development, mainly \nthrough voluntary labor for the earthworks for excavation of structure foundations, canals, and \non-farm channels. The maximum  cost of an individual water management scheme will be \n$100,000  at  an  estimated  cost  not  to  exceed  $550/ha  for  secondary  and  tertiary  canal \ninfrastructure, including costs of surveys, design, resettlement, civil works, and mitigation of \nenvironmental impacts. \n \n    c.  Improvement of Rural Roads  \n \n30.  The Project will support subprojects to improve the connection of villages to commune \ncenters  and  main  highways.  Recognizing  the  importance  of  good  transportation  links,  the \nGovernment has put considerable resources into rehabilitation and reconstruction of rural roads \nthroughout Cambodia.24 Improved maintenance of roads is a key government objective. Villages \nin the project area are mostly clustered close to highways 5 or 6, and the main scope is for \nrehabilitation of roads up to 10 km long (but mostly 5 km or less) linking the communes to \nhighways 5 and 6.  \n \n31.  Project support will be limited to improving rural roads and associated structures that are \nimportant to the success of development activities of the Project or other agencies working in \nthe communes. Activities will include rehabilitation of strategic rural roads, including upgrading \nor provision of essential bridges, culverts, and fords; and limited assistance with maintenance. \nExisting road alignments will be retained except for specific problem areas. Road sections that \nwould extend into the buffer zone of Tonle Sap within 1,000 meters will not be eligible for project \nsupport. \n \n32.  The Project will support: (i) rehabilitation of about 230 km of rural roads, according to \nMRD rural road standards including (a) resurfacing and spot repairs; (b) provision of individual \nbridges  and  ford  crossings;  and  (ii)  organization  and  training  of  rural  road  maintenance \ncommittees, including provision of basic road maintenance tools.25 The maximum cost of an \nindividual  road  subproject  will  be  $100,000.  Local  communities  will  contribute  labor  for \nconstruction and maintenance. \n \n2.  Rural Livelihoods Improvement and Employment Options Enhancement  \n33.  The Project will support development of new livelihood options for rural communities in \nproject communes aimed at expanding on-farm and off-farm agricultural and nonagricultural \nincome-generating activities. It will support:  \n \n                                                 \n22  Larger schemes may be considered on a case-by-case basis. \n23  Voluntary contribution of labor will be equivalent to one person day per beneficiary household; or a maximum of the \nequivalent of 15% of the scheme cost. Additional labor will be paid at the unskilled labor rate, agreed by the \nProvincial administration. \n24  National and provincial (primary and secondary) roads are the responsibility of the Ministry of Public Works and \nTransport (MPW&T), but the Ministry of Rural Development (MRD) has sole responsibility for tertiary and sub-\ntertiary roads (generally referred to as rural roads). \n25 Road maintenance committees may be established in communes where the road is not subject to through traffic \nand the commune accepts responsibility for maintenance of the upgraded roads.  \n ", "9 \n(i)  intensification of rain-fed and irrigated agriculture through (a) organization of \nfarmer groups (for technology dissemination, mutual learning and support, and \naccess  to financial services); (b) development and implementation of technology \nimprovement packages, establishment of demonstration farms,26 and training of \nfarmers;  and  (c) facilitating  farmer  group  access  to  existing  rural  financial \ninstitutions for farm credit; and \n(ii)  development of off-farm livelihoods through (a) organization of solidarity groups \nfor development of small-scale business enterprises, (b) identification of market \nopportunities  and  viable  business  activities,  (c)  training  for  development  of \ntechnical  skills  and  business  management  and  record  keeping,  and  (d) \nassistance in development of business plans and facilitating access to existing \nfinancial services.  \n \n34.  The  Project  will  use  the  agro-ecosystem  analysis  and  associated  technical \nimplementation procedures approach of the national agricultural extension guidelines to identify, \nwith the communes, the most applicable agricultural technology packages as the basis for \nagricultural  investments.  Village  level  technical  services  will  be  made  available  by \nimplementation of programs targeted at increasing people\u2019s income from on-farm and off-farm \nenterprises. \n \n35.  The Project will provide funds to strengthen technical and vocational training capacity at \nprovincial and commune level, and increase accessibility to vocational training for employment \nand self-employment for socially disadvantaged groups. It will build on the existing framework \nand  institutional  capacity  for  provision  of  vocational  training.  It  will  support  technical  and \nvocational training provided at the provincial level through government departments such as the \nRural Economic Development Office, nongovernment organizations (NGOs), and private sector \nprograms. \n \n3.  Project Management \n36.  The Project will support coordination and day-to-day management of the Project through \n(i)  capacity  strengthening  at  the  executing  agency  (EA),  implementing  agency  (IA),  and \ncommune council level with provision for a limited number of incremental technical staff at \nselected  offices;  (ii) consulting  services  (national  and  international);  (iii)  provision  of  office \nequipment and facilities; and (iv) provision of supervision vehicles (four-wheel drive vehicles, \nmotorbikes, and bicycles). The Project will support the recruitment and remuneration of two \ncommune council supporters, one female and one male, to be appointed by each commune \ncouncil for a period of 48 months, a total of 3,840 person-months  of support in the 40 selected \ncommunes (Supplementary Appendix C). \n \nC.  ADF IX Grant Component  \n37.  As a poor, debt-stressed country, Cambodia is eligible for Asian Development Fund \n(ADF) grant financing of up to 50% of its ADB lending program.27 It is recommended that ADB \nprovide the Project with $9,900,000 grant financing from the ADF IX grant facilities. Special \njustifications include the poverty alleviation focus and the Project\u2019s close alignment with the TSI \nand the Government\u2019s Rectangular Strategy. The ADF IX grant will support focused capacity \nbuilding at commune level, aimed at strengthening local decision making and opening access to \nnew  business  and  livelihood  opportunities.  The  Project\u2019s  focus  on  community-driven \ndevelopment will accelerate the reduction of poverty and vulnerability in one of the poorest \nregions of Cambodia as a basis for sustainable improvements to livelihoods in the Tonle Sap \n                                                 \n26  It is expected that the majority of technology improvement package will be related to field and garden crops. \nHowever, support to aquaculture improvements may be provided if requested by the community groups. \n27 ADB 2004.

The  grant  will  support  project  implementation  consultants,  including  inputs  at \nprovincial  level  to  strengthen  capacity  in  line  departments  to  further  decentralization  and \ndeconcentration efforts. \n \nD.  Special Features \n38.  An important feature of the Project will be alignment with the Strategic Framework for  \nDecentralization and Deconcentration Reforms, which promotes major reforms of the current \nsubnational  governance  system. The  framework  is  a  5-year  national  program  to  establish \ninstitutional capacity at provincial level, establishing provincial/municipal and district councils, \nand channeling development spending and capacity building to all levels of the subnational \ngovernance system and phasing out of project implementation units.28 In line with the objectives \nof harmonization and the Government\u2019s wish to empower communes to plan and implement \nsubprojects in collaboration with provincial technical departments, the implementation structure \nof the Project will be fully consistent with the framework. Consulting services inputs will mainly \nbe deployed in the selected provinces, and will work in line departments to support and develop \nexisting offices. A minimum of incremental staff will be seconded to these departments during \nthe project period to assist with the additional works involved. \n \n39.  The Project is consistent with the Government\u2019s intention that a substantial amount of \ndomestic resources and external aid be channeled directly to support newly empowered sub-\nnational units of planning and budgeting. The CDF, managed by the commune councils, will \nfinance  component  elements  of  the  5-year  commune  development  plans  (Supplementary \nAppendix B) that are prioritized in the commune investment plan annual planning cycle. The \nProject  will  also  finance  upgrading  of  irrigation  (designed  and  implemented  by \nMOWRAM/PDWRAM) and road infrastructure (designed and implemented by MRD/Provincial \nDepartment  of  Rural  Development  [PDRD]),  identified  in  the  annual  district  integration \nworkshops and provincial investment plan. \n \n40.  The  Project  will  support  provincial  implementation  through  provision  of  consulting \nservices in each participating province to assist line agency staff to develop the capacity to \nimplement  new  standard  operating  procedures  as  modified  in  agreement  with  ADB.29 The \nprovincial  support  team  will  provide  training  and  backstopping  to  the  commune  council \nsupporters appointed by the commune councils in project communes, and assist the provincial \nlocal  administration  units  to  monitor  and  report  the  activities  undertaken  by  the  commune \ncouncils. \n \n41.  Access to rural financial services is necessary to enable adoption of new technologies \nand to establish small-scale rural enterprises. These services are potentially available through \nexisting  commercial  banking  and  licensed  MFIs  in  all  project  communes.  The  Project  will \nsupport consulting services to: (i) strengthen the identification of new business opportunities; \n(ii) coordinate  training,  capacity  development,  and  pilot  demonstration  activities;  and \n(iii) facilitate access to financial services in the participating communes, provided by existing \nfinancial  institutions.  It  will  facilitate  individuals  and  groups  to  access  financial  services  at \ncommune level by helping identify viable business opportunities, providing training, developing \nbusiness  plans,  and  making  links  between  financial  service  providers  and  interested \nparticipants. The use of existing commercial and licensed service providers will provide an \ninnovative solution to ensuring sustainable access to financial services in rural areas beyond the \n                                                 \n28  Many project implementation units are of a semi-parallel nature, not fully integrated into government structures. For \nexample, most report to the Government in some way, with some degree of government staff involvement in \naspects of project implementation. \n29 Ministry  of  Economy  and  Finance  (MEF).  2005a.

The Project will assist financial service providers in providing basic \nfinancial management skills training as part of the Project\u2019s capacity development program. To \nensure  the  Project  does  not  distort  the  credit  market  at  commune  level,  financial  service \nproviders  will  make  all  loan  decisions  based  on  the  providers\u2019  assessment  of  the  credit-\nworthiness of the applicant and the proposed investment. \n \nE.  Project Investment Plan \n42.  The total project cost is estimated at $24.00 million, including taxes and duties of $1.2 \nmillion. About $13.54 million is allocated to rural infrastructure, $2.40 million to rural livelihood \ndevelopment, and $4.91 million to project management. Project costs are summarized in Table \n1.

Financing Plan \n43.  It is proposed that ADB provide a loan of $10.1 million equivalent in SDR from its Special \nFunds resources. The loan will have a term of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years, with \nan interest charge of 1% per year during the grace period and 1.5% per year during the \nremaining term. \n \n44.  The Government has requested $9.9 million in grant funds from the ADF to finance \n(i) social infrastructure, (ii) development of new options for rural livelihoods, (iii) implementation \nconsultants, (iv) the project management office (PMO), and (v) incremental operational costs for \nthe project IAs\u2019 provincial level organizations. \n \n45.  The balance of the project cost ($3.0 million equivalent or 12.5% of total project cost) will \nbe funded by the Government\u2019s incremental staff salaries, taxes and duties from their own \nbudgets, and the project beneficiaries will contribute about 1.0 million (4.5% of project cost) in \nthe form of in-kind labor and local materials.

Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Project Management \n46.  MOWRAM will be the EA responsible for overall management of the Project. Project IAs \nwill have the following responsibilities: \n \n(i)  Provincial Local Administration Units (PLAUs) in project provinces: improvement \nand development of social infrastructure (Component 1a). \n(ii)  MOWRAM:  improvement  of  agriculture  and  water  management  infrastructure \n(Component 1b). \n(iii)  MRD: improvement of rural roads (Component 1c).  \n(iv)  MAFF:  rural  livelihoods  improvement  and  income-generating  options \nenhancement (Component 2). \n  \n47.  MOWRAM will establish a PMO at the national level, headed by a project director. The \nPMO will have four deputy directors (one each from MOWRAM, MRD, Ministry of Interior [MOI], \nand MAFF) who will be responsible for management and supervision of the activities of their \nrespective IAs. The PMO will include technical and accounting staff who have had experience \nwith  ADB  procedures,  rules,  and  guidelines;  and  who  will  be  responsible  for  consultant \nrecruitment,  procurement,  funds  withdrawal,  disbursement,  and  reimbursement.  Project \nimplementation arrangements are in Appendix 5. \n \n48.  The  Government  will  establish  a  project  steering  committee  (PSC)  to  oversee  and \ncoordinate project implementation. The PSC will be chaired by a minister of MOWRAM or his \ndelegate, with membership at an appropriate level from the Ministry of Economy and Finance \n(MEF), MAFF, Ministry of Environment, MOI, Ministry of Women\u2019s Affairs, and MRD. The PSC \nwill meet on a quarterly basis for the first 12 months after loan and grant effectiveness and at \nleast every 6 months thereafter, or more frequently as needed. Within 2 weeks after each \nmeeting,  the  PSC30 will  submit  a  copy  of  the  meeting\u2019s  minutes  to  ADB.  A  provincial \ncoordination committee, to be chaired by the governor or his delegate with membership of the \ndirectors  of  PDWRAM,  Provincial  Department  of  Agriculture  (PDA),  PDRD,  Provincial \nDepartment  of  Environment,  and  chief  of  the  PLAU  will  be  responsible  for  successful \ncoordination of the Project at provincial level. \n \n49.  PLAUs and PDWRAM, PDRD, and PDA will assist in project implementation at the \nprovincial level. Each department head will designate department staff to assist in day-to-day \nproject implementation. Subprojects meeting project requirements (Supplementary Appendix A) \nwill be identified and selected through the decentralized planning process currently used to \nprepare 5-year commune development plans, annual commune investment plans, and annual \nprovincial  investment  plans.  The  relevant  provincial  departments  will  assist  the  commune \ncouncils to carry out the pre-investment studies needed to (i) assess the feasibility of the \n                                                 \n30  The royal decree approving the formation of Tonle Sap Basin Authority was signed by the King of Cambodia in \nSeptember 2007. When operational, the Government may consider assigning steering committee tasks for the \nProject to the new authority. \n ", "13 \nproposed infrastructure investment; (ii) prepare the design and cost estimates; (iii) assess the \nlikelihood  of  damage  to  the  environment;  (iv)  assess  the  resettlement  impact,  if  any;  and \n(v) prepare an O&M plan. Selected social infrastructure subprojects (under Component 1a, \nfunded by the CDF) will be implemented by commune councils with the technical support of \nappropriate  provincial  departments.  Subprojects  under  Components  1b,  1c,  and  2  will  be \nimplemented by the appropriate provincial departments with guidance from the line ministries \nconcerned.   \n \n50.  The  Project  will  provide  for  strengthening  the  capacity  of  participating  provincial \ndepartments and commune councils in subproject design and implementation, and financial \nmanagement through incremental staff support and staff training. A team of international and \nnational consultants will assist the provincial departments and commune councils in the overall \nplanning, design, and implementation; and in addressing specific institutional and technical \nissues.  \n \n2.  Implementation Period \n51.  The Project will be implemented over 6 years from mid-2008 to mid-2014 (Appendix 6). \nSince  the  subproject  investments  will  be  relatively  small  in  size,  and  many  interventions \nidentified  during  project  design  are  already  identified  in  the  commune  investment  plan, \npreparation work in most commune level subprojects is expected to begin within the first year.  \n \n3.  Procurement \n52.  Goods and works financed partly or wholly by ADB will be procured in accordance with \nADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  Equipment  to  be \nprocured under the Project will consist primarily of office and training equipment, bicycles, \nmotorbikes, utility vehicles, and minor construction equipment and tools. No contract package is \nexpected to exceed $500,000 and international competitive bidding is not envisaged under the \nProject.  Each  contract  costing  between  $100,000  and  $500,000  will  be  awarded  through \nnational competitive bidding (NCB). Minor equipment and materials costing less than $100,000 \nwill be procured through shopping.  \n \n53.  No works contract packages are expected to exceed $100,000. Works contracts under \nComponent 1b, 1c, and 2 will be awarded by IAs on the basis of NCB. The procedures to be \nfollowed for NCB, for goods and works, will be those set forth in the Government\u2019s Procurement \nManual  (footnote  34)  with  clarifications  and  modifications  to  be  described  in  the  financing \nagreement between the Government and ADB.  \n54.  Individual works contracts under Component 1a using the CDF will not exceed $20,000 \nand  may  be  awarded  to  contractors  selected  through  shopping  or  direct  contracting. \nProcurement  and  contract  management  procedures  developed  under  Seila  will  be  used.31 \nWorks  contracts  under  the  CDF  may  also  be  awarded  to  community  groups  following \nprocedures for community participation in procurement in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement \nGuidelines. The first civil works contract in each province will be subject to ADB approval. \nSubsequently, the PLAU will maintain documents32for review by ADB. The project procurement \n \nplan is in Appendix 7 and the financial management assessment is in Supplementary Appendix \nE. \n \n55.  All  procurement  contracts  for  office  equipment  over  $5,000  and  vehicles  will  be \nprocessed and awarded by the PMO. Works contracts under Component 1a will be processed \n                                                 \n31\nNational Committee for Support to Communes/Sangkats. 2005.

Works contracts under Components 1b, 1c, and \n2 will be processed and awarded by the respective provincial departments.  \n \n4.  Consulting Services \n56.  The Project will require a total of 489 person-months of consulting services (55 person-\nmonths of international specialists and 434 person-months of national specialists). An indicative \nstaffing  schedule  is  in  Appendix  8  and  outline  terms  of  reference  are  in  Supplementary \nAppendix  F.  All  consultants  except  the  postharvest  management  specialists  and  the  TSI \ncoordinator will be selected and engaged as a firm in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the \nUse of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). In selecting the firm, the quality and \ncost-based selection method (80:20) will be used and the short-listed firms will be required to \nsubmit  full  technical  proposals.  Provision  has  been  made  for  postharvest  management \nspecialists (international and national) with expertise in postharvest technology to be selected \nas individual consultants. The Government has agreed to recruit the individual consultants in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s procedure for recruiting individual consultants. The TSI coordinator will \nbe recruited by ADB to support and coordinate project implementation under the TSI, and \nimprove communication between the EAs of TSI projects and ADB. These arrangements will be \ndescribed in detail in the project administration manual. \n \n5.  Anticorruption Policy \n57.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the Government. Consistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability and \ntransparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged \ncorrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the Project. To support these \nefforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the loan and grant \nregulations and the bidding documents for the Project shall include provisions specifying the \nright of ADB to audit and examine the records and accounts of the Executing Agency and all \ncontractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service providers as they relate to the Project. To \nencourage greater stakeholder participation and vigilance and to ensure greater transparency \nand accountability the Project will do the following: \n \n(i)  Build capacity within the EA to understand and comply with ADB and government \nprocedures as outlined in the project administration manual. \n(ii)  Widely publicize the existence of the integrity division within ADB\u2019s Office of the \nAuditor General as the initial point of contact for allegations of fraud, corruption, \nand abuse among ADB-financed projects or its staff. \n(iii)  Establish a project website to disclose information about various project-related \nissues, including procurement. The website will include information on, among \nothers, the list of participating bidders, name of the winning bidder, basic details \non bidding procedures adopted, amount of contract awarded, and the list of \ngoods/services procured. Any bidder may request an explanation from the EA/IA \nas to why a bid was unsuccessful. The EA/IA will respond within 20 working \ndays. \n(iv)  Establish a reporting system at commune council offices to disclose information \nabout  various  project-related  issues,  including  procurement.  A  public  notice \nboard will display information on, among others, the list of participating bidders, \nname  of  the  winning  bidder,  basic  details  on  bidding  procedures  adopted, \namount of contract awarded, and the list of goods/services procured.  \n(v)  Notify civil society organizations of the date and location of selected events in the \nprocurement process, including public bid openings, contract signings, progress \nreviews, and handover ceremonies. \n ", "15 \n(vi)  Set up a complaints and action task force at the PMO to receive and resolve \ncomplaints/grievances or act on reports from stakeholders on misuse of funds \nand other irregularities. \n \n58.  Disbursement  to  individual  communes,  provinces,  or  IAs  will  be  suspended  if \nmisprocurement  or  other  irregular  procurement  action  occurs  and  is  not  resolved  to  the \nsatisfaction of ADB. Individual staff of the EA/IAs will be removed from the Project in the event \nof their confirmed participation in cases of corrupt practices. ADB is processing a TA on Public \nFinancial  Management  to  assist  MAFF,  MOWRAM,  and  MRD  to  strengthen  internal  audit \nprocedures and ensure improved financial management and transparency in operations. The \nTA is expected to be implemented in 2008, coinciding with implementation of the Project, and it \nis anticipated that relevant findings of the TA will be incorporated in the Project. \n \n6.  Disbursement Arrangements \n59.  The Government, through MEF, will open a US dollar denominated account at the \nNational Bank of Cambodia with separate accounts for the project loan and grants proceeds \nimmediately after loan and grant effectiveness. MOWRAM will open US dollar denominated \nimprest accounts in a commercial bank acceptable to ADB immediately after loan and grant \neffectiveness.  The  accounts  will  be  established,  managed,  replenished,  and  liquidated \naccording to ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2007, as amended from time to time). \nProject advances will be deposited into the imprest accounts on the basis of the estimated next \n6 months of project expenditures or a maximum of 10% of the loan/grant amount, whichever is \nlower. MOWRAM will transfer part of the imprest account funds to second generation imprest \naccounts held by PDWRAM, PDRD, and PDA with a commercial bank to finance activities \nunder Components 1b, 1c, and 2, respectively. The imprest accounts will be replenished and \nliquidated on a monthly basis or when the accounts are drawn down by 20% of the initial \ndeposits. MOWRAM will also transfer part of the imprest account fund to the CDF accounts held \nby  participating  commune  councils  with  a  commercial  bank  to  finance  activities  under \nComponent 1a. MOWRAM will disburse $1,000 to each commune CDF to enable recruitment of \ncommune  council  supporters  to  assist  the  councils  in  preparing  projects  for  approval. \nAppendix 9 shows project accounts and fund flows. \n \n60.  The statement of expenditures procedure will be used to liquidate and replenish the \nimprest  accounts  for  eligible  expenditures.  Any  individual  payment  to  be  reimbursed  or \nliquidated  under  this  procedure  shall  not  exceed  the  equivalent  of  $50,000.  Statement  of \nexpenditures  documentation  will  be  retained  at  the  PMO  and  participating  provincial \ndepartments. Imprest account and statement of expenditures records will be audited during the \nannual audit process.  \n \n7.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n61.  The Project will be administered in accord with the Financial Management Manual for \nInvestment Projects (footnote 29), which describes the Government\u2019s financial management \npolicies and procedures for efficient and effective implementation of ADB and World Bank \nprojects, and achievement of the objectives. MOWRAM, MRD, MAFF, PLAU, and participating \nprovincial departments and communes will maintain separate accounts for the loan and grant \nproceeds for the Project. Operating advances to EA/IA staff will be reconciled within 1 week of \nthe end of each month and before further advances are made. IAs will prepare and submit \nmonthly financial reports to PMO by the 15th day of the following month. The PMO will submit a \nconsolidated quarterly report to ADB, MEF, and the PSC not later than 1 month after the end of \nthe reporting quarter. \n \n62.  The  project  accounts  will  be  audited  each  year  by  independent  external  auditors \nacceptable to ADB. The audited accounts, together with the auditor\u2019s report, will be submitted to \n ", "16\n   \nADB not more than 6 months after each financial year. The imprest accounts and statement of \nexpenditures will be audited as part of the regular audit of project accounts and financial \nstatements, and the audit report will include auditor\u2019s opinions on the imprest account and \nstatement of expenditures.  \n \n8.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation   \n63.  Three different kinds of monitoring will be carried out during project implementation: \n(i) progress monitoring, (ii) safeguard monitoring, and (iii) benefit monitoring and evaluation. The \ndesign and monitoring framework (Appendix 3) will be used by the PMO, assisted by the project \nconsultants, to prepare and implement a project performance management system (PPMS) to \n(i)  examine  the  Project\u2019s  technical  performance;  (ii)  evaluate  delivery  of  project  facilities; \n(iii) assess  achievement  of  the  Project\u2019s  objectives;  and  (iv)  measure  the  Project\u2019s  social, \neconomic, financial, and institutional impacts. Socioeconomic data shall be disaggregated by \nincome group, gender, and ethnic group where applicable. Gender-disaggregated indicators will \nbe established for the PPMS, and monitoring will be continued to ensure that activities are \ncarried out effectively and targets reached. The EA and IAs will be responsible for carrying out \nPPMS activities. IAs will provide the PMO with quarterly progress reports on their activities, \ncompliance with safeguard requirements, and achievement of outputs. These will be reflected in \na consolidated quarterly progress report.33 Quarterly reports will be submitted to ADB, the PSC, \nIAs, and MOWRAM\u2019s Gender Mainstreaming Action Group within 1 month of the end of each \nquarter. Baseline data for each commune will be assembled from government sources and \nthrough household surveys and participatory monitoring activities. The PMO will establish a \nbaseline data set for each commune within 6 months of loan and grant effectiveness. Detailed \nanalysis  of  project  impacts  will  be  presented  in  a  final  monitoring  report  before  project \ncompletion. A project completion report will be prepared by the PMO and submitted to ADB \nwithin 3 months after completion of the Project. MOWRAM agreed to ensure that a qualified \nsocial science or other suitably qualified institution acceptable to ADB will be contracted to \nconduct  independent  external  monitoring  and  evaluation  of  the  resettlement  process  and \nimpacts, with reports provided to ADB and EA every 6 months. Key indicators are identified in \nSupplementary Appendix G. \n \n9.  Project Review \n64.  ADB and the Government will undertake semiannual reviews facilitated by the PMO. The \nreviews will: (i) examine the appropriateness of implementation arrangements and schedules of \nactivities, (ii) assess the procedures for commune development and infrastructure development \nplans, (iii) review compliance with agreed procurement procedures, (iv) analyze the outcomes of \ncapacity  building  and  training  programs,  and  (v)  monitor  the  effectiveness  of  safeguard \nprocedures. A comprehensive midterm review will be jointly undertaken by the Government and \nADB within 36 months of loan and grant effectiveness to identify any problems and constraints \nencountered, and assess the need for midcourse modification of the project scope and financing \nand implementation arrangements. Technical and budgetary changes to the project documents, \nincluding reallocation of loan and grant proceeds, will also be considered. \n \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \nA.  Benefits and Impacts \n65.  Investment  in  rural  infrastructure,  combined  with  delivery  of  technical  services,  will \n                                                 \n33  Quarterly reports will include: (i) description of progress by component and the Project as a whole during the \nperiod; (ii) changes to implementation plans; (iii) details of resettlement; (iv) implementation of the environment \nassessment and review framework; (v) major project activities by the PMO, EA, and IAs; (vi) financial and \nprocurement-related information; (vii) problem summaries and proposed remedial action; and (viii) the work plan for \nthe next period.  Second and fourth quarter reports will include assessments of impacts on targeted beneficiaries. \n ", "17 \ndirectly  benefit  about  68,000  households,  including  354,000  people  in  40  communes \n(Supplementary Appendix A) in three provinces around Tonle Sap, and will strengthen local \ngovernment authorities in facilitating and delivering services to these communities. Benefits will \ninclude: (i) a reduction in poverty in the target districts, (ii) increased agricultural production and \nother livelihood activities, (iii) community empowerment, and (iv) increased local government \ncapacity. \n66.   Economic  Benefits.  The  cumulative  and  multiplier  effects  of  improved  rural \ninfrastructure, increased household incomes, and reduced poverty will enable greater economic \nactivity in the target communes. The Project will assist beneficiary families to start up livelihood \nactivities or enjoy greater participation in them. Project outcomes that will enhance economic \nactivity include (i) increased employment; (ii) increased wealth as a result of accumulation of \nagricultural  assets;  (iii)  improved  access  to  financial  services  for  poor  rural  households; \n(iv) higher  food  security;  (v)  value  addition  at  household  and  small  and  medium-sized \nenterprises levels; (vi) improved yields, resulting in tradable surpluses; (vii) greater use of farm \ninputs, resulting in higher turnover for suppliers; (viii) small-scale infrastructure improvements, \nincluding roads and irrigation rehabilitation; and (ix) in the medium and long term, higher levels \nof tax revenue to the Government, which should lead to improved government services. \n67.  The Project adopts a sector approach, where the entire scope of project activities is not \nknown at the project preparation stage. Five core subprojects34 were analyzed as representative \nevaluations of the Project\u2019s economic viability and financial sustainability. The economic internal \nrate of return (EIRR) was calculated for these subprojects to determine their economic viability \nand serve as benchmarks for selection of subprojects at the time of project implementation. \nBase case EIRRs range between 19.0% and 22.1%; economic net present values (ENPVs) are \nin the range of $419,000 and $520,000; and benefit-cost ratios are estimated in the range of \n1.49\u20131.70. These indicators suggest that, other things being equal, all five core subprojects \nexamined are economically viable since EIRRs are above the cutoff rate of 12%. \n68.  The  five  core  subprojects  selected  for  the  analysis  covered  a  population  of  about \n60,000 people  (11,000  households),  63%  of  which  are  categorized  poor  compared  to  the \nnational average of 36%. Major benefits for target beneficiaries will come from net incremental \nincome generated by livelihood models as a result of the Project\u2019s support to increase cropping \nintensities, access to finance, and extension service schemes, among others (Supplementary \nAppendix K includes estimates of livelihood models). Project investment in new infrastructure, \nas well as upgrading and rehabilitation of existing infrastructure, will bring about a wide range of \nother  benefits\u2014mainly  via  cost  savings.  Numerous  types  of  cost  savings  are  expected, \nincluding savings from reduced damages from floods, travel time/cost savings for potable water, \nand health and medical cost savings.  \n69.  A number  of other benefits cannot be readily quantified, including (i) reduced food \npoverty  via  better  food  security;  (ii)  enhanced  local  capacity  through  TA  in  planning  and \nmanagement  of  infrastructure;  (iii)  increased  exchanges  of  experience,  skills,  and  farming \ntechniques; (iv) local savings promotion; (v) empowerment of women; (vi) improved teaching \nand  learning  quality  through  school  improvements  (new  construction  and  rehabilitation); \n(vii) increased awareness and adjusted mindset in natural resource protection; and (viii) a wide \nrange of benefits and cost savings attributed to rural infrastructure that are not readily quantified \nsuch as travel time and vehicle cost savings, transport services development at communes, \nincreased utility of land frontages created by improved intervillage and inter-commune roads, \nand road links to provincial and national highways. Economic analyses are in Appendix 10 and \nSupplementary Appendix K. \n                                                 \n34 These are (i) Ampil Tuek Commune, Kampong Tralach District, Kampong Chhnang Province; (ii) Pralay Commune, \nStoung  District,  Kampong  Thom;  (iii)  Rumlech  Commune,  Banan  District,  Pursat  Province;  (iv)  Srae  Sdok \nCommune,  Kandieng  District,  Pursat  Province  (subsequently  dropped  because  of  overlap  with  Tonle  Sap \nSustainable Livelihoods Project); and (v) San Kor Commune, Kampong Svay District, Kampong Thom Province. \n ", "18\n   \n70.  Social Impacts. The major social impacts of the Project are expected to be positive, and \nwill entail improved livelihoods and reduced levels of poverty for the population of the project \narea. Annual household expenditure is estimated to increase by 26% from $300 to $378 and \nincremental employment of about 1,000 person-years per annum. The majority (67%) of the \nbenefits will go to farmers, the Government will receive about 36% (mostly in the form of duties \nand taxes), while new businesses will receive 5%, and hired labor 3%. The estimated poverty \nimpact ratio will be 41%. No involuntary resettlement is foreseen under subprojects funded from \nthe CDF. Safeguards are built into the community decision-making process to deal with any \nlosses that may arise. Significant resettlement impacts are not expected from agricultural water \nmanagement infrastructure and rural road infrastructure because the works will be improved \nalong existing rights-of-way and will mainly require, if any, the acquisition of minor amounts of \nland  plus  compensation  for  roadside  trees,  crops,  or  possibly  small  buildings.  Subproject \nselection criteria will exclude any activities that cause significant involuntary resettlement. The \nsummary poverty reduction and social strategy is in Appendix 11. The Government and ADB \nhave agreed on a resettlement framework (Appendix 12 and Supplementary Appendix H).35 \nAllowances, operational and administration costs, surveys, monitoring, and reporting will be \nfinanced  from  loan  and  grant  funds.  The  resettlement  entitlement  matrix  is  shown  in \nSupplementary Appendix M. \n \n71.  The Government and ADB have agreed that the Project will ensure the participation of \nindigenous people, if these communities are located in the project communes. Special attention \nwill be given during planning and implementation of subprojects so that indigenous people will \nderive maximum benefit from the subproject. The preparation of ethnic minority specific actions \nwill form a part of subproject design in communes where indigenous people live. The Cham is \nthe major group of non-Khmer living in the Project\u2019s target districts and communes. Throughout \nthe target provinces, Cham live in all-Cham and mixed Cham-Khmer villages. Although the \nCham are Muslim and form communities based on religious, social, and cultural practices, their \nlivelihoods are similar to the majority Khmer population. \n  \n72.  The rapid rural appraisal under the project preparatory TA (footnote 2) concluded that \nwomen will be beneficiaries of subprojects. Women comprise around half of all workers in the \nagriculture sector; and contribute more hours of labor to cultivation, agricultural processing, and \nmarketing of agricultural produce than men. In the project communes, the proportion of female-\nheaded households ranges from 8% to 36% based on data from the 2005 Commune Data \nBase. Female-headed households are poorer\u2014they constitute 41% of the poor and 32% of the \npoorest wealth categories compared with 18% of rich households and 24% of middle wealth \nhouseholds. The Project\u2019s gender action plan (GAP) ensures that women will benefit equally \nfrom the Project compared with men (Appendix 13). It is designed to address the negative \nimpacts of resettlement, if any; and it will ensure that gender issues are mainstreamed into \nsubproject selection, resettlement plans, and environmental assessments.  \n \n73.  Special measures have been built into the project design to deal with potential social \nimpacts and promote community participation. These include (i) the appointment of male and \nfemale commune council supporters by each commune council; (ii) a resettlement framework; \n(iii)  detailed  description  of  participatory  practices  for  subproject  identification,  design, \nimplementation, and O&M; and (iv) capacity building training for PLAU, PDWRAM, PDRD, PDA, \nand  PMO  staff  in  social  safeguards  and  community  participation.  Community-driven \ndevelopment specialists will be located in each participating province.  \n \n74.  Environmental Concerns. An initial environmental examination (IEE) was conducted \nfor  the  Project  as  a  whole  and  for  the  sample  subprojects  to  identify  potential  impacts, \nappropriate mitigation measures, and monitoring mechanisms. The environmental assessment \n                                                 \n35  The Government approved the resettlement framework (Supplementary Appendix H) on 7 September 2007. ADB \nfunds can be used for compensation to project-affected persons for loss of income, loss of crops, and economic \nrehabilitation. Acquisition of land is not eligible for ADB funds. \n ", "19 \nis summarized in Supplementary Appendix I. The IEE confirms that the Project is not likely to \ncause significant adverse environmental impacts since investments are small in scale and \nmainly focus on rehabilitation or upgrade of existing structures. Subproject screening criteria will \nexclude subprojects that will be located within or adjacent to environmentally sensitive areas or \nwould cause negative environmental impacts. Projected minor impacts can be minimized with \nthe proposed mitigation measures, and an adequate budget is allocated in the overall project \ncosts for this cost. Subprojects will follow environmental assessment procedures stipulated in \nthe environmental assessment and review framework (Supplementary Appendix J) developed to \nensure compliance with the Government\u2019s environmental regulations and ADB\u2019s Environment \nPolicy (2002). \n \nB.  Risks and Mitigation \n75.  Risks associated with rural infrastructure activities include limited capacity of provincial \nand  district  staff,  lack  of  adherence  to  technical  and  environmental  standards  during \nconstruction,  and  the  inability  of  beneficiaries  to  operate  and  maintain  investments  after \ncompletion. The infrastructure to be provided is small-scale, and most of these concerns will be \naddressed through rigorous supervision, training, and the creation of responsive user groups to \nensure maintenance. The consulting services will include community development specialists \nlocated in each province, designated as deputy team leaders and leading the provincial support \nteam,  to  assist  line  agencies  in  implementing  the  Project  in  accordance  with  the  project \nadministration manual through the existing provincial offices.  \n \n76.  Recent governance risk assessments have identified (i) procurement, (ii) purchase of \nexpendable materials/services, and (iii) quality assurance of works as being subject to high risk \nof corrupt practices (footnote 12).  Financial and accountability systems do not currently provide \nan acceptable standard of fiduciary control. The Government is committed to public financial \nmanagement reform; and has requested ADB assistance for TA to support improved public \nfinancial management in MOWRAM, MAFF, and MRD (para. 58). This is expected to become \navailable within 9 months of the project loan and grant effectiveness. A good governance \nframework has been developed for the Project and agreed with Government to guide EA and IA \nstaff during implementation (Supplementary Appendix N). \n \n77.  The Government\u2019s decentralization and deconcentration program is radically changing \nthe way in which government agencies function. The Project will be implemented during a \nperiod of evolving decentralization. As a result, it might face coordination problems between \nnational sector agencies and province, district, and commune governments. This risk will be \nmitigated through the PSC as a forum for interagency coordination of action plans, and regular \nmeetings between the PMO, provincial IAs, and the provincial support teams.  \n \nV.  ASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \nA.  Specific Assurances \n78.  In  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \nassurances, which will be incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n(i)  The Government will ensure that only subprojects without significant resettlement \nimpacts, as defined in ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy (1995), will be financed \nby the Project. Subproject short resettlement plans, prepared in accordance with the \nprocedures given in the resettlement framework, will be disclosed to people affected \nprior to submitting to ADB for review. Approval of the resettlement plan by ADB will \nbe a precondition to award of contracts for civil works. \n(ii)  The Government will ensure that appropriately qualified and experienced personnel \nare appointed to the PMO. \n ", "20\n   \n(iii)  Within three (3) months of the loan and grant effective date, the Government will \nestablish a provincial coordination committee in each participating province, chaired \nby  the  provincial  governor  or  his  delegate,  with  membership  consisting  of  the \nprovincial  directors  of  PDWRAM,  PDA,  PDRD,  and  Provincial  Department  of \nEnvironment, and the chief of the PLAU, and which shall be responsible for overall \ncoordination of the Project at the provincial level.  \n(iv)  Within six months of the loan and grant effective date, the Government will ensure \nthe PMO has established a project specific web-site for public disclosure about the \nuse  of  the  loan  and  grant  funds;  including  details  of  procurement  and  contract \nawards, and reports of the independent monitor. The web site will be updated within \nfour weeks of contract awards. Arrangements for display of project information on \ncommune notice boards will be made. \n(v)  The Government will ensure that the provincial director of each IA and the chief of \nthe PLAU will identify the technical staff responsible for implementing the Project. All \nProject  staff  will  be  knowledgeable  about  ADB  procedures,  including  (i) \nimplementation, (ii) procurement, (iii) use of consultants, (iv) disbursement, and (v)  \nprevention of fraud and corruption. \n(vi)  The Government will ensure that all Project staff are aware of the requirements of \nthe Project\u2019s Good Governance Framework.  \n(vii)  The Government will ensure that MOWRAM establishes a Complaints and Action \nTask Force to receive and resolve complaints or grievances related to the project.  \n(viii)  The Government will ensure MOWRAM publicizes the existence and role of the ADB \nIntegrity Division.  \n(ix)  Civil society organizations will be notified and invited to observe selected events (bid \nopenings, contract signings, and meetings to review Project progress).  \n(x)  Selection of subprojects will be carried out in accordance with the agreed selection \ncriteria  and  that  subprojects  are  included  in  the  provincial  investment  plan  or \ncommune investment plan as appropriate and integrated to the annual work plan and \nbudget. \n(xi)  The Government will ensure that each IA in the participating provinces carries out \nenvironmental screening for all proposed subprojects to determine the environmental \ncategorization and prepare the necessary environmental safeguard documents for \ninclusion in the Project\u2019s annual work plan and budget. MOWRAM will ensure that: \n(a) environmental assessment documents are based on the environmental screening \nchecklists  and  on  the  sample  IEE  prepared  during  project  preparation;  (b)  the \nenvironmental  assessment  documents  meet  ADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy \nrequirements; (c) IEEs include details of local consultation carried out; and (d) IEEs \nare submitted to ADB for approval prior to commencing activities under a works \ncontract for a subproject if any critical environmental issues have been identified. \nThe Government will ensure that all civil works contracts include specific measures \nto mitigate negative environmental impacts and will monitor their implementation. \n(xii)  The Government will ensure that, in the event unexploded ordnance clearance is \nneeded, the Government and MOWRAM will remove, at its own cost, all unexploded \nordnances suspected to exist on subproject sites by engaging the services of a \nreputable and experienced mine security organization, acceptable to ADB, to carry \nout and then certify subproject area clearance.  \n(xiii)  The Government will ensure that the EA and IAs utilize the agreed environmental \nassessment review framework to implement the Project; the EA will monitor the \ncontractors\u2019  implementation  of  civil  works  and  ensure  environmental  mitigation \nmeasures identified in the IEE are employed.   \n(xiv)  Tender documents will include provisions to ensure contractors\u2019 preferential hiring of \nlocal labor, and to comply with the labor law/code including guaranteeing equal \nopportunities for female workers to work with the principle of equal pay for work of \n ", "21 \nequal value. Contractors will be required to recruit women as a minimum of 35% of \nthe paid unskilled labor. \n(xv)  In the event that indigenous people are affected by, or are beneficiaries of, any \nsubproject,  the  provincial  rural  development  committee  will  ensure  that  ethnic \nminority specific actions will be prepared and implemented in each subproject area. \n(xvi)  The Government will ensure that the Project is implemented in accordance with the \nagreed GAP (Appendix 13) and shall include, but not be limited to the following: \n \n(a)  Commune council supporters (1 female and 1 male per commune) will be \nhired to enable women\u2019s participation during subproject preparation.  \n(b)  At least 30% of the management committee of each group (e.g., FWUG, \nFWUC, road maintenance committee, etc.) will be female and all groups will \nhave 30% female members. \n(c)  On aggregate, at least 30% of the participants of all the training programs will \nbe female. A minimum of 15% of participants at all training programs will be \nfemale. \n \nB.  Conditions for Loan and Grant Effectiveness \n79.  As a condition for declaring the loan and grant effective, the membership and mandate \nof the PSC will be confirmed by the Government; and the PMO will have been established and \nprofessional staff appointed. \n \nVI.  RECOMMENDATION \n80.  I  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  loan  and  grant  would  comply  with  the  Articles  of \nAgreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve: \n \n(i)  the loan in various currencies equivalent to Special Drawing Rights 6,466,000 to \nthe  Kingdom  of  Cambodia  for  the  Tonle  Sap  Lowlands  Rural  Development \nProject from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources with an interest charge at the rate of \n1% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter; a term of \n32  years,  including  a  grace  period  of  8  years;  and  such  other  terms  and \nconditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft \nFinancing Agreement presented to the Board; and \n(ii)  the  grant  not  exceeding  the  equivalent  of  $9,900,000  to  the  Kingdom  of \nCambodia from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources for the Tonle Sap Lowlands \nRural Development Project. \n \n \n \n \n  Haruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n  \n14 November 2007\n ", "22   Appendix 1     \nSECTOR ANALYSIS \n \nA.  Tonle Sap Basin in Transition \n \n1.  The Tonle Sap Initiative (TSI)1 is a response to severe pressure on Tonle Sap Lake (also \nknown as the Great Lake or Tonle Sap), caused particularly by increasing population and \neconomic development. In the provinces surrounding the lake\u2014Kampong Chhnang, Pursat, \nBattambang,  Banteay  Meanchey,  Siem  Reap,  and  Kampong  Thom\u2014about  38%  of  the \npopulation falls under the official poverty line, and half of the villages have 40\u201360% of their \nhouseholds living below the poverty line (Table A1). Many poor households migrate seasonally \nto the lake and upland forests to exploit natural resources and supplement the livelihood gained \nin their own village. This adds to the pressures placed on the lake by resident communities, and \nresults in rapid overexploitation of fisheries and wildlife, encroachment on the lakeshores for \nagriculture during the dry season, pollution, and cutting of the remaining areas of seasonally \nflooded forests. \nTable A1: Geographic Distribution of Poverty in Cambodia \n \n  Population  HDI \nProvince  Level  Percent  Densitya  Score  Rank \nKompong Cham  1,608,914  14.1    164  0.475  5 \nKandal  1,075,125  9.4    301  0.496  4 \nPhnom Penh     999,804  8.7  3448  0.936  1 \nPrey Veng     946,042  8.3     194  0.419  12 \nBattambangb     816,035  7.1      68c  0.456  6 \nTakeo    790,168  6.9   222  0.432  10 \nSiem Reapd    764,443  6.7      68e  0.325  19 \nKompong Speu     598,882  5.2    85  0.456  7 \nBanteay Meanchey  577,772  5.1    87  0.409  13 \nKompong Thom  569,060  5.0   41  0.336  18 \nKampotf  557,065  4.9  108g  0.448  9 \nSvay Rieng  478,252  4.2  161  0.429  11 \nKompong Chhnang  417,693  3.7    76  0.453  8 \nPursat  360,445  3.2      28  0.401  14 \nKratie  263,175  2.3   24  0.506  3 \nKrong Prean Sihanouk  155,690  1.4  179  0.659  2 \nKoh Kong  132,106  1.2   12  0.374  16 \nPreah Vihear  119,261  1.0    9     \nRatanak Kiri    94,243  0.8   9  0.375  15 \nStung Treng    81,074  0.7   7  0.371  17 \nMondul Kiri    32,407  0.3   2  0.216  20 \nTotal     100.0  64  0.472   \n11,437,656 \nHDI = human development index. \na Persons per square kilometer. \nb Includes Krong Pailin. \nc Battambang only.

The National Context: National Strategic Development Plan, 2006\u20132010 \n \n2.  The National Strategic Development Plan (NSDP), 2006\u20132010, is the formal means of \nimplementing the Government\u2019s Rectangular Strategy for Growth,  Employment, Equity and \nEfficiency (2004\u20132008). It sets national priorities of alleviating poverty and enhancing economic \ngrowth. Major emphases include (i) enhancement of the agricultural sector; and (ii) rehabilitation \n                                                 \n1 Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2006.

Manila. \n ", "              Appendix 1  23 \nand construction of physical infrastructure, which includes management of water resources and \nirrigation as one of its four components.  \n \n3.  The NSDP set a target of increasing irrigated area from 20% of total cropland in 2005 to \n25% in 2010. In response to the NSDP, the Ministry of Water Resources and Meteorology \n(MOWRAM) considers that its principal focus must be on extending the irrigated area. There are \nmany uncertainties regarding definitions and actual areas, but MOWRAM set a goal in its \nStrategic Development Plan for the Water Sector, 2006\u20132010, that farmers of irrigable cropland \nare better able to manage water over an area that is increasing by at least 10,000 hectares (ha) \nper  year.  A  similar  goal  has  also  been  set  for  rain-fed  croplands.  These  are  extremely \nchallenging,  but  considered  necessary  if  the  Government\u2019s  Rectangular  Strategy  is  to  be \nachieved in practice. Inevitably, MOWRAM must allocate considerable resources and effort to \nirrigation systems.  \n \nC.  Agriculture and Water in Cambodia \n \n4.  Agriculture accounts for one third of Cambodia\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) and is \nthe main source of livelihood for nearly 80% of the population. In 2005/2006, the total cultivated \narea of rice was 2.44 million ha (2.12 million ha in the wet season), with 0.23 million ha of \nindustrial crops and 0.23 million ha of secondary crops. Total rice production in 2005 was 5.99 \nmillion  tons,  giving  a  national  surplus  of  over  1.30  million  tons.  Average  rice  yields  have \nincreased markedly to an average of 2.48 tons/ha in 2005. Yields of rice grown during the dry \nseason  (December\u2013March)  on  average  are  higher  than  during  the  wet  season  (May\u2013\nSeptember): 3.09 tons/ha versus 2.26 tons/ha in 2005. Total 2005 dry season production was \n1.25 million tons (21% of the total). Yield and total production are very dependent on weather \nconditions and flooding, so recent increases may not necessarily be sustained.   \n \n5.  Lack of availability of sufficient water is widely perceived as the critical constraint on rice \nproduction. The Government\u2019s Rectangular Strategy identifies irrigation as one of 16 strategic \npriorities  for  national  development.  However,  according  to  the  Food  and  Agricultural \nOrganization of the United Nations (FAO), only 20% of Cambodia\u2019s croplands are potentially \nirrigable because of unfavorable topography, lack of a water source, or unsuitable soil types.2 \nThis means that a large percentage of Cambodia\u2019s croplands will remain rain-fed. Even for \ncroplands that are irrigable, rainfall and stream flow are so variable from year to year that water \nfor supplementary irrigation3 may not be available when it is most needed. The critical time is at \nthe beginning of the growing season (April\u2013May) when the soil must be softened in readiness \nfor ground preparation and rice seedlings must be established. Other times are during the \u201csmall \ndry season\u201d which tends to occur in June\u2013July, and toward the end of the cropping cycle when \ngrain is filling out.  \n \n6.  MOWRAM\u2019s hydrometeorological databases demonstrate that stream flow in Tonle Sap \nbasin cannot be relied on for supplementary irrigation. Consequently, supplementary irrigation \nsystems dependent on run-of-river water supplies may be of little help at critical times. Some \nform  of  storage\u2014with  volumes  sufficient  to  supply  water  during  the  relatively  short  critical \nperiods when rainfall and stream flow are insufficient\u2014is desirable. It is not necessary to rely on \nrivers and streams as sources of irrigation water. Indeed, in view of in-stream values (fish \nproduction, navigation, domestic water supply, social uses), it may not be desirable. People \nincreasingly recognize the need to leave sufficient water in a river for human uses other than \nagriculture, as well as for maintenance of aquatic ecosystems and fisheries. In many other \ncountries with unreliable rainfall, water harvesting is widely used to provide water for tree crops, \n                                                 \n2 Source: www.fao.org/ag/agl/aglw/aquastat/cambodia/  accessed 15 August 2007. \n3  The greater part of irrigated cropland in Cambodia receives most of its water from rainfall and natural overland flow, \nand irrigation systems supply additional (supplementary) water to provide better growing conditions. \n ", "24  Appendix 1   \nvegetables,  other  high  value  crops,  home  gardens,  and  supplementary  irrigation.4 Water \nharvesting and storage has been widespread in Cambodia in the past, and there are still \nthousands of ponds throughout the country.5 However, traditional techniques appear to have \nfallen into disuse, partly as a result of Khmer Rouge efforts to build standardized systems based \non diversion structures and distribution canals. \n \n7.  Although  Cambodia  has  recently  returned  to  national  self-sufficiency  in  rice,  food \nsecurity is still a major issue for a large percentage of the population, particularly in Tonle Sap \nbasin. For many households\u2014those with small or no landholdings, infertile soils, or insufficient \nmoney to buy fertilizer and high quality seed\u2014their own production does not meet their needs \nfor the entire year. Their hungry season may last for some months, and income-generating \nactivities are essential so that rice can be purchased. \n \nD.  The National Strategy for Agriculture and Water, 2006\u20132010 \n \n8.  The NSDP encourages ministries to plan in a sectoral and coordinated manner. The \nGovernment\u2019s  Strategic  Framework  for  Decentralization  and  Deconcentration  Reforms  also \npromotes a transfer of responsibilities and resources to subnational levels. During the coming \n5\u20136 years, it can be expected to radically change the way in which government agencies \nfunction. The NDSP required that a Strategy for Agriculture and Water be developed by the end \nof 2006. \n \n9.  During 2006, a task force of the Technical Working Group on Agriculture and Water \nworked on the Strategy on Agriculture and Water, which was expected to be signed off by the  \nMinistry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (MAFF) and MOWRAM ministers by the end of \nthe year. The goal of the strategy is to contribute to poverty reduction, food security, and \neconomic growth by (i) enhancing agricultural productivity and diversification, and (ii) improving \nwater  resources  development  and  management.  This  will  be  achieved  principally  through \n(i) more efficient use and management of water and land, (ii) increased agricultural productivity, \nand (iii) enhanced agribusiness processes, (iv) institutional capacity building, and (v) improved \naccess to knowledge and technology. The specific objectives and actions, to be finalized in \nearly 2007, will address the five types of capital already referred to above. Key components of \nthe strategy are pertinent to the proposed Project because they show the range of interventions \nthat could be considered. \n \n10.  Strengthen the Enabling Environment. The enabling environment for agriculture and \nwater  includes  relevant  policies,  laws/regulations,  institutional  capacity,  etc.  Ongoing \nstrengthening is required, e.g., to develop MAFF and MOWRAM capacities to enforce laws and \nassociated  sub-decrees  related  to  water  use,  watershed  management,  and  other  natural \nresources. \n \n11.  Mobilize Natural Resources: Water, Land, and Soil. The strategy will include, as \nexamples,  promoting  improved  crop  water  management  through  water  harvesting/storage, \ngravity-fed irrigation systems, and technology such as drip irrigation of vegetables; promoting \nsoil fertility management; protecting water resources from pollution and degradation so that they \ncontinue to be available for fisheries, ecosystem maintenance, etc.; promoting rice field fisheries \nand aquaculture; and promoting settlement of cultivable land and securing land ownership \nagainst land theft. \n                                                 \n4 Critchley, W. Siegert, K. And Chapman, C. Finkel, M. 1991. Water harvesting. A manual for the design and \nconstruction of water harvesting schemes for plant production. Rome: FAO. \n5  Rice farmers in the seasonally flooded area around Tonle Sap and on the Mekong\u2013Tonle Sap floodplains store \nfloodwater behind bunds. As water level drops, recession rice is planted on the newly exposed land, and the stored \nfloodwaters are progressively released to provide supplementary irrigation when required. This technique of \nsupplementary irrigation is in some respects more reliable, but enables farmers to encroach into the buffer zone. \n ", "              Appendix 1  25 \n \n12.  Mobilize Human and Financial Resources. The strategy must mobilize and make \nbetter use of people and money, including as examples promoting education, training and \nextension in agriculture and water, development of appropriate technology, more efficient use of \nskilled people such as extension workers and engineers, better access to money needed for \ninvestment and operation and maintenance (O&M), greater engagement of the private sector in \nagriculture, and water management and agribusiness. \n \n13.  Empower People and Communities. The strategy will seek to empower communities \nto  work  together  and  be  more  self-reliant.  This  includes,  as  examples,  establishing  and \nsupporting farmer water user committees; assisting farmers to establish cooperatives to market \ncrops and purchase inputs; promoting the availability of micro-credit and other funding sources \nto allow people to invest in crop production and agribusiness development; and encouraging \ncommunity  organizations  (commune  councils,  village  development  committees,  etc.,  with \naccess  to  Commune  Development  Funds)  to  participate  in  the  planning  and  operation  of \ncommunity projects for water supply, water management infrastructure, communal rice drying \nfacilities, etc. \n \n14.  Increase Productivity of Agriculture. This element of the strategy aims to increase \nproduction, reduce production costs per unit of output, and assist in assuring product quality. It \nwill help to achieve increased production of high quality products, thus achieving both food \nsecurity and commercial goals. Elements of the strategy will include, as examples, improving \nthe quality of inputs such as seeds and fertilizers; reducing harvesting and postharvest losses; \nand introducing innovative agricultural and water management practices.  \n \n15.  Extend  Commercial  Agriculture.  The  strategy  will  assist  farmers  to  engage  in \ncommercial production by, as examples, providing information and forecasts regarding market \ndemand; promoting new product opportunities; establishing value-added processing facilities; \nadministering arrangements for product quality assurance and food safety; and facilitating entry \ninto  profitable  markets,  particularly  via  improved  transport  and  storage  facilities,  marketing \ninfrastructure, bulking/wholesaling arrangements, etc. \n \nE.  Stabilizing Livelihoods \n \n16.  A livelihood includes the capabilities, assets, and activities required to maintain a means \nof living. A livelihood is sustainable when the assets on which it is based\u2014including human and \nnatural resources\u2014are not being diminished, and a household is able to absorb adversity such \nas drought or illness without long-term harm. A rapid rural appraisal carried out in 2006 in \n32 selected  villages  of  the  six  provinces  confirmed  that  most  households  do  not  have \nsustainable livelihoods, and are vulnerable to shocks.6 Their physical resources (land, water, \nnatural products) and human resources (skills, knowledge, and healthy labor) are insufficient \nand/or are deteriorating. A natural response by such a household is to exploit common property \nresources, which is increasingly leading to the \u201ctragedy of the commons\u201d in Tonle Sap basin. \nHence,  the  urgent  need  to  stabilize  and  then  improve  the  livelihoods  of  the  lowland \ncommunities. \n \n                                                 \n6  ADB. 2006. Rapid Rural Appraisal Summary Report. Manila. TA 4756-CAM consultants\u2019 report (unpublished). The \nrapid rural appraisal concluded that 91% of the surveyed households cannot rely on the land they farm and/or \nresources locally available to survive. In villages with reasonable access, up to 20% of households send at least \none member to find wage labor in nearby towns. The future of rural people around Tonle Sap will increasingly rely \non a prosperous urban sector. \n ", "26  Appendix 1   \n17.  Resources crucial to sustainable livelihoods for rural populations around Tonle Sap are \nas follows:7 (i) natural capital\u2014land, water, fish, and other living resources; (ii) human capital\u2014\nhealthy and strong members of the household, with the skills and knowledge necessary to \nprovide for their needs; (iii) financial capital\u2014the funds needed to purchase the goods and \nservices they are not able to provide (e.g., fertilizer, seeds, fuel) to cope with unforeseen events \n(e.g.,  ill  health,  marriages);  (iv)  social capital\u2014the  community  relationships  and  institutions \nneeded to enable cooperation and mutual support; and (v) physical capital or infrastructure\u2014\nhousehold  equipment  (boats,  ploughs,  etc.)  and  facilities  (roads,  markets,  and  water \nmanagement facilities) that are of a public good nature, and must be provided by the community \nrather than the individual household. \n \n18.  The rapid rural appraisal found that villagers ranked the top 10 livelihood issues as \nfollows:8 (i) water management for agriculture (30 villages); (ii) roads and bridges (28 villages); \n(iii) health and hygiene (28 villages); (iv) wells and drinking water (26 villages); (v) seeds, \nfertilizer, pest control, farming equipment (21 villages); (vi) access to education; (vii) livestock \nservices (17 villages); (viii) off-farm income generation and training (16 villages); (ix) improved \nfisheries management (12 villages); and (x) food security (10 villages). Occupational training, \nvillage pond water supplies, and access to credit were ranked slightly lower. These results \nclearly show the importance of physical capital (infrastructure and equipment), human capital \n(both health and knowledge), natural capital (especially water and fish), and financial capital (to \npurchase inputs and pay for health and other services). Social capital is not explicitly mentioned, \nbut is essential for the other issues to be addressed successfully.9 \n \n19.  External support agencies are converging on a model of rural/community development \nthat provide a package of complementary interventions. Examples are the Northwestern Rural \nDevelopment  Project,  Tonle  Sap  Sustainable  Livelihoods  Project,  and  Area  Development \nProgram approach employed by World Vision Cambodia.10 A strong emphasis is placed on \ncommunity  empowerment  (social  capital).  Capacity  building,  technical/vocational  training, \neducation and extension services, provision of credit, etc. (human and financial capital) are \nchanneled  through  village  development  committees,  commune  councils,  and/or  other \ncommunity-based organizations, to engage communities in addressing their needs for natural \nand physical capital. \n \nF.  Link between Private Enterprise and Project Interventions \n \n20.  An  underlying  theme  of  the  Strategy  for  Agriculture  and  Water  is  that  increased \ninvolvement in the cash economy is essential for people to lift themselves out of poverty. \nSubsistence agriculture is not able to do so or even meet basic food security needs. The rural \n                                                 \n7  A fuller description of the five types of capital is in Appendix 1 to ADB. 2005. Technical Assistance to the Kingdom \nof Cambodia for Preparing the Tonle Sap Lowland Stabilization Project. Manila (TA 4756-CAM approved on 21 \nDecember for $1.0 million). \n8  Villagers were aware that the rapid rural appraisal was being carried out by a team supported by the Provincial \nDepartment of Water Resources and Meteorology (PDWRAM), which may have influenced the top ranking of water \nmanagement for agriculture. \n9  A participatory rural appraisal carried out in preparation for the Tonle Sap Sustainable Livelihoods Project \n(footnote 7) found a different order of ranking for the 33 villages located in the transition zone: (i) irrigation systems \nfor dry season cultivation (56%); (ii) access to credit (56%); (iii) livestock activities (40%); (iv) improved health and \nhygiene (24%); (v) improved roads and bridges (24%); (vi) improved access to education; (vii) better rice seed, \nfertilizers, and pest control; (viii) non-rice agriculture; (ix) aquaculture; and (x) postharvest production management. \n10 ADB. 2001.

Methodology and Assumptions \n1.  The proposed Project adopts the sector approach, where the entire scope of project \nactivities is not known at the Project Preparatory Technical Assistance (PPTA) stage. Financial \nand economic analyses were conducted to evaluate the viability of five core subprojects1 selected \nfor feasibility studies rather than for the whole Project (Supplementary Appendix K). The financial \nand  economic  analyses  of  core  subprojects  serve  dual  objectives:  (i)  as  a  representative \nevaluation of the whole Project\u2019s economic viability and financial sustainability; and (ii) more \nimportantly, as a set of benchmarking criteria for the selection of future subprojects eligible for \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  financing  as  far  as  financial  and  economic  aspects  are \nconcerned. The analyses placed more emphasis on the second objective because only when \nappropriate subprojects are selected will the whole Project become financially sustainable and \neconomically viable. \n2.  The  financial  and  economic  analyses  were  consistent  with  relevant  ADB  guidelines, \nhandbooks, and technical notes.2 The analyses also incorporated best-practice dimensions in the \nfinancial and economic analyses of interventions in the livelihood sector. \n3.  The Project has an implementation period of 6 years (2008\u20132014) and the economic life of \nthe  project  interventions  has  been  assumed  to  be  20  years  (2008\u20132027).  For  the  present \nanalysis, the prevailing interbank exchange rate of KR4,000 per US dollar3 has been used. A \ndiscount rate of 12% has been used to estimate the net present value and serve as a cutoff point \nfor the economic internal rate of return (EIRR).  \n4.  The  economic  analysis  determined  incremental  benefits  attributable  to  project \ninterventions in the five core subprojects, including: (i) benefits from an expected increase in \nagricultural production (economic-converted financial revenue); and (ii) realizable cost savings \ncaused by investment in new infrastructure and rehabilitation and upgrading of existing rural \ninfrastructure.  The  economic  viability  of  each  core  subproject  is  evaluated  against  standard \nbenchmarks (i.e., EIRR >12%, benefit-cost ratio >1.0, and economic net present value (ENPV) \n>0). \n5.  Financial revenue and costs were estimated using constant 2007 prices. Financial farm-\ngate prices are based on findings of the surveys undertaken by the PPTA team for the feasibility \nstudy during 2006. The analyses use a world price numeraire where economic prices for traded \ncrop outputs and inputs have been based on World Bank commodity price projections. Labor \ncosts have been shadow-priced at 0.80 of the wage rates while other inputs have been adjusted \nby the standard conversion factor of 0.90 as applicable for Cambodia.  \n6.  Project investments are assumed to increase productive agricultural areas by improved \nwater management and extension services, enabling increased cropping intensity in all terraces. \nTable A10.1 outlines the cropping intensity by core subproject and land category. The dry season \nirrigated area will increase from effectively zero in all subprojects to 6\u20139% in the with-Project \nscenario. The cropping intensity for the rain-fed and supplementary irrigation areas also increases \n                                                 \n1 These are: (i) Ampil Tuek Commune, Kampong Tralach District, Kampong Chhnang Province; (ii) Pralay Commune, \nStoung District, Kampong Thom; (iii) Rumlech Commune, Banan District, Pursat Province; (iv) Srae Sdok Commune, \nKandieng District, Pursat Province; and (v) San Kor Commune, Kampong Svay District, Kampong Thom Province. \n2 Asian Development Bank (ADB). 1997.

During the preparation stage, the PPTA team conducted socioeconomic surveys and \ndocumented  basic  data  on  current  and  potential  income-generating  activities  (the  livelihood \nmodels) in five core subproject locations through sample surveys, focus group discussions, in-\ndepth  interviews  with  relevant  local  stakeholders,  as  well  as  reviewing  secondary  data  and \nexisting literature. As a result, farm and household models were identified as possible livelihood \nmodels (on-farm and off-farm) to assist local residents in target areas to improve their living \nstandards.  Land-use  profiles\u2014classified  lowland  lower  terrace,  lowland  middle  terrace,  and \nlowland  upper  terrace\u2014were  used  to  identify  appropriate  on-farm  livelihood  models.  Survey \nresults and information gathered during site visits were used to determine possible off-farm \nlivelihood models.  \n8.  Identified  livelihood  models  (on-farm  and  off-farm)  were  analyzed  individually  to \n(i) simulate the future income-generating profile for the model owners/operators in the with- and \nwithout-Project scenario; and (ii) estimate incremental income attributable to project interventions. \nIt  is  assumed  that  all  investment  and  operating  costs,  as  well  as  the  associated  revenues \n ", "  Appendix 10  49 \ngenerated by these models, are incremental and would not have been realized without the \nProject\u2019s interventions.  \n9.  The  livelihood  models  were  selected  as  representative  models  for  analysis  and \nrecommended for future implementation because (i) they are considered affordable to start with \nreasonable capital investments; (ii) they are easy to implement, taking into account local skills, \nexpertise, available resources, education level, and farming culture; and (iii) more importantly, \nthey have reasonable market demand for outputs.  \n10.  The list of livelihood models is not exhaustive and the mixture of livelihood models in each \ncore subproject may not be identical at the time of project implementation. Therefore, further \nassessment needs to be made in close consultation with local residents to ensure that activities of \nhigh value added are selected for implementation by local households and microenterprises. This \nis to ensure that risks of inappropriateness of the models are minimized at the time of project \nimplementation.  \nB.   Project Benefits \n11.  The  Project\u2019s  goal  is  to  improve  livelihoods  in  three  provinces  (Kampong  Chhnang; \nKampong Thom; and Pursat) around Tonle Sap basin. Target rural communities will benefit from \nthe  improved  coverage  and  quality  of  rural  infrastructure  (irrigation,  roads,  village  level \npostharvest facilities, and markets) as well as new opportunities resulting from the application of \nnew skills in the pursuit of on-farm and off-farm enterprises to improve their livelihoods. In \nparticular, target rural communities will benefit from (i) improved rural infrastructure, including \nsocial infrastructure; (ii) rehabilitated and upgraded agriculture water management infrastructure \nand increased rice production and productivity, and reduced susceptibility to droughts and floods; \n(iii) improvement of inter-village/commune roads and road links to main provincial and national \nhighways; and (iv) increased income from the creation and development of diversified livelihood \noptions (i.e., on-farm and off-farm agricultural and nonagricultural income-generating activities). \n12.  Beneficiaries. The five core subprojects will cover a population of about 60,000 people \n(11,000 households), 63% of which is categorized poor. The poverty incidence is the highest in \nthe San Kor subproject (76%), and the Srae Sdok subproject has the lowest poverty incidence \n(51%). However, all the five core subprojects selected have poverty ratios substantially above the \nnational poverty ratio of 36%. Table A10.3 outlines the target beneficiary population in the five \ncore subprojects. The majority of the target beneficiaries are involved in agriculture production \nand local small-scale commercial activities. The Project\u2019s support will help increase cropping \nintensity to enable local residents to expand agricultural production (rice and non-rice crops), \nensure food security in the short term, and reduce poverty in the medium term. \nTable A10.3: Target Beneficiary Population \n  Population  Poverty Profile \nSubproject  # Persons  # Households  # Poor Households  % of Total \nAmpil Tuek Subproject  12,370  2,379  1,642  69 \nPralay Subproject  12,634  2,304  1,198  52 \nRumlech Subproject    8,404  1,562  937  60 \nSrae Sdok Subproject  11,103  1,960  1,000  51 \nSan Kor Subproject  15,383  2,802  2,130  76 \n      Total (estimate)  59,894  11,007  6,906  63 \nSources: Project preparatory technical assistance reports. \n ", "50  Appendix 10 \n  1.  Quantifiable Benefits \n13.  The major benefits will be net incremental income from the livelihood models as a result of \nthe  Project\u2019s  effort  to  increase  the  cropping  intensities,  micro-credit  support,  and  extension \nservice support schemes. Supplementary Appendix K outlines the results of individual model \nanalysis in each of the five core subprojects. The financial benefit stream is derived by estimating \nthe net incremental income for each representative livelihood model multiplied by (i) the projected \nland  area  in  case  the  model  involves  agriculture  production,  and  (ii)  the  number  of  model \nreplicators in case the model involves off-farm activities and where the number of micro- and \nhousehold businesses is identifiable. The financial benefit stream4 is then converted into the \neconomic benefit stream using the standard conversion factor. Annual household expenditure is \nestimated to increase by 26% from $300 to $378. \n14.  Project  investment  in  new  infrastructure,  and  upgrading  and  rehabilitation  of  existing \ninfrastructure, bring about a wide range of other benefits through cost savings. The economic \nanalysis quantifies the cost savings the Project is expected to generate. Numerous types of cost \nsavings are expected, including cost savings from cleaning up and damages after floods, travel \ntime/cost savings for potable water (to and from the river/lake), and health and medical cost \nsavings (formal and informal hospital fees and medical treatments). These benefits from cost \nsavings were estimated for three out of five core subprojects (Ampil Tuek, Pralay, and Rumlech) \nas they are evident from the scope of priority infrastructure investments. For Srae Sdok and \nSan Kor  subprojects,  the  target  population  will  probably  enjoy  these  benefits,  but  further \nassessment will be needed at the beginning of subproject implementation when the commune \npriorities are confirmed. \n  2.  Nonquantifiable Benefits \n15.  A number of other benefits cannot be readily quantified. First, food poverty is a critical \nproblem  in  the  majority  of  communes  around  Tonle  Sap  basin.  The  Project  will  contribute \nsignificantly to ensure food security and gradually eradicate food poverty. While benefits of food \npoor reduction can quantifiable, these benefits may also be attributed to factors other than project \ninterventions.  Second,  the  Project  will  help  build  capacity  for  local  stakeholders,  including \ncommune  councils  and  public  utility  entities  in  charge  of  irrigation,  roads,  and  other  rural \ninfrastructure. Benefits will mainly come from Project TA in planning, management, operation, and \nmaintenance of irrigation schemes, and social and technical infrastructure. Improved planning will \nbe  the  key  to  increase  efficiency  because  the  investment  in  fixed  assets  (infrastructure)  is \nnormally expensive. If investment is not well planned, the level of wastage may be expected to be \nvery high. Improvement in management of operation and maintenance (O&M) activities will also \ngenerate  benefits  from  annual  cost  savings  and  hence  reduce/minimize  government  budget \nrequirements and enable participatory O&M. \n16.  Third, in addition to financial benefits, livelihood improvement activities will be a local \nforum (commune halls)5 for farmers to exchanges experience, skills, and farming techniques to \nhelp move away from traditional and backward farming techniques. This forum, together with \nmicro-credit  and  savings  groups,  will  promote  local  savings  for  reinvestment  and  empower \nwomen\u2019s roles and positions in society. Fourth, school improvements (both new construction and \n                                                 \n4  The financial internal rate of return for each core subproject is not very useful in the context where the mix of \nlivelihood activities to be undertaken in each commune is highly uncertain. \n5 The Project may support upgrading of commune meeting halls if the commune is not included under the Commune \nCouncil Development Project (ADB. 2002.  Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors \non a Proposed Loan and Technical Assistance Grant to the Kingdom of Cambodia for the Commune Council \nDevelopment Project. Manila. (Grant 4007, for $3.0 million approved on 3 December). \n \n ", "  Appendix 10  51 \nrehabilitation) will significantly improve the teaching and learning quality of commune schools. \nIndirect benefits will include lower dropouts, increased net enrolment rates, and an increased \ntransition rate to lower and upper secondary schools. Fifth, the Project will contribute to increase \nawareness and change the mindsets of local people in natural resource protection.  \n17.  Sixth, cost savings that are not readily quantifiable include travel time and vehicle cost \nsavings, transport services development at communes, increased utility of land frontages created \nby improved intervillage and inter-commune roads, and road links to provincial and national \nhighways. Cost savings may also occur from additional classrooms that may be constructed 6 in \nthe immediate neighborhood. By not having to travel to other villages or communes for schooling \nto avoid overcrowding, children\u2019s travel time is saved, and parents save financial contributions \n(formal and informal) to schools outside their home communes. \nC.   Summary Economic Analysis \n18.  The EIRR was calculated for the five core subprojects to determine their economic viability \nand serve as benchmarks for selection of subprojects at the time of project implementation.  \n19.  The results of the economic analysis for the five core subprojects are summarized in \nTable A10.4. Base case EIRRs range between 19.0% and 22.1%; ENPVs are in the range of \n$419,000 and $520,000; and benefit-cost ratios are estimated at 1.49\u20131.70. These indicators \nsuggest that, other things being equal, all five core subprojects are economically viable,7 since \nEIRRs in base cases are well above the cutoff rate of 12%. As the economic analysis of the five \ncore subprojects serves as an evaluation of the whole Project, it is considered economically \nviable since the EIRRs exceed the economic opportunity cost of capital benefits quantified. \nBesides quantifiable benefits, other social, environmental, and capacity building benefits have not \nbeen quantified because of measurement difficulties and lack of data. Therefore, the analyses \ncan be regarded as a conservative estimate of the overall benefits. \n20.  Sensitivity  analysis  was  undertaken  to  test  the  robustness  of  the  analysis  and  the \nconsequences of changes in the following (combinations of) variables: (i) capital cost increase by \n10%; (ii) O&M cost increase by 10%; (iii) benefit decrease by 10%; (iv) benefit delay of 2 years; \n(v) benefit delay of 4 years; (vi) a combination of capital cost increase by 10% and O&M costs \nincrease by 10%; and (vii) a combination of capital cost increase by 10%, O&M cost increase by \n10%, and benefit decrease by 10%. The results of the sensitivity analysis for the five core \nsubprojects are summarized in Table A10.4. \n21.  The results of the sensitivity analysis show that all core subprojects under examination are \nhighly sensitive to delays in project implementation and hence realization of benefits, particularly \nwhen benefits delay 4 years (Table A10.4 \u201clow\u201d column). Field experience in Cambodia has \nrecorded  significant  delays  in  project  implementation  with  regard  to  livelihood  improvement \nprojects because of limited local capacity, delaying realization of benefits. As such, it is strongly \nrecommended that the project operating entities of the three project provinces pay due attention \nto capacity building for responsible staff and strictly follow the project implementation schedules. \nFactors delaying project implementation should be well under control and minimized to ensure the \nProject\u2019s  economic  viability.  Results  of  economic  and  sensitivity  analyses  for  each  core \nsubproject are outlined in Supplementary Appendix K. \n                                                 \n6 The proposed project plan will allow assistance for classroom construction, upgrading, and rehabilitation in communes \nnot covered by the Education Sector Development Program.

Distribution Analysis and Poverty Impact Assessment \n22.  Distribution  analyses  have  been  prepared  separately  for  each  core  subproject.  The \nfollowing beneficiaries can be identified in the Project: (i) micro- and household enterprises will \ngain because of positive net financial benefits from livelihood activities; (ii) the Government and/or \neconomy will benefit where financial costs exceed economic costs; (iii) labor will gain where the \nfinancial costs of labor exceed its opportunity costs, both in implementation and operation phases \nof the subproject; and (iv) utility services (mainly irrigation services entities) will lose because \ndirect cost recovery from beneficiaries is lower than required.  \n23.  Distribution of benefits and poverty impact analysis for the five core subprojects is in Table \nA10.5. Total net benefits are estimated at about $1.9 million. The proportion of benefits accruing \nto the poor is estimated at $771,000, producing an overall poverty impact ratio of 40.8% of total \nnet  benefits,  suggesting  the  Project  would  make  a  significant  contribution  to  local  poverty \nreduction.

Fiscal Impact Analysis \n24.  The fiscal impact of the Project is important, as it helps assess the sustainability level. In \npractice, rural livelihood improvement projects often support capital and recurrent cost outlays, \nmaking the recurrent cost sustainability issue one of central importance in the economic analysis. \nThe impact on the overall budget after the Project is completed often determines whether the \nproject objectives will be sustained in the long run. Key issues to be addressed include the project \ninvestment\u2019s  impacts  on  fiscal  indicators  such  as  annual  state  budget  allocation,  capital \nreplacement, and recurrent expenditure for during and after the project implementation period.  \n25.  Table A10.6 presents recurrent cost outlays estimated for the whole Project. The essential \npart is the cost to finance O&M activities to be borne by public utility entities with regard to \nirrigation, rural water and sanitation, and other civil works. When the project implementation \nperiod is completed, the annual cost to be borne by public utility entities is estimated at $274,000 \nwhile annual cost recovery (mainly from the irrigation service fee) is estimated at $114,000\u2014\nleaving  an  annual  deficit  of  $160,000  to  be  allocated  by  the  Government.  This  level  of \ngovernment contribution (subsidy) is considered affordable in the context of development in \nCambodia.  However,  the  project  operating  entities  should  prepare  a  realistic  cost  recovery \nschedule bearing in mind that (i) the level of subsidies should be made in a transparent manner; \nand (ii) the more revenue collected via the user pays principle, the lower the subsidy required. \nTable A10.6: Summary Fiscal Impact Analysis \nItem/Year  Year 1  Year 2  Year 3  Year 4  Year 5  Year 6  Year 7  Year 8 \n \nA.

Linkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \n       \nIs the sector identified as a national    Yes  Is the sector identified as a national   Yes \npriority in country poverty analysis?      priority in country poverty partnership   \n      No  agreement?      No \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in Cambodia: \n \nDespite relatively robust growth over the past decade, official figures indicate that the incidence of poverty has \ndeclined only modestly, from 39% in 1994 to 36% in 1999. Cambodia\u2019s recent growth has been concentrated in \nurban areas, and based around the garment and tourism sectors. Poverty in Cambodia remains predominantly rural, \nand the majority of the poor live in rural areas and rely on agriculture for their livelihoods. The poverty rate ranges \nfrom a low of 10\u201315% in Phnom Penh to 40\u201345% in rural areas, reaching 70\u201380% in some areas around Tonle Sap \nbasin. Against this background, the current Asian Development Bank (ADB) country strategy and program, 2005\u2013\n2009, focuses on Tonle Sap Basin to support poverty reduction in one of the poorest and most environmentally \nsensitive regions of Cambodia.  \n  \nThe need for accelerating rural development to achieve poverty reduction is well recognized and is given priority in \nthe (i) Second Socioeconomic Development Plan (SEDP II), 2001\u20132005, which is the basis of the Poverty \nReduction Partnership Agreement between the Government of Cambodia and ADB, 2005; (ii) National Poverty \nReduction Strategy, 2003; (iii) Rectangular Strategy for Growth, Employment, Equity and Efficiency, 2004; and \n(iv) National Strategic Development Plan (NSDP), 2006, which replaces the Second Socioeconomic Development \nPlan and the National Poverty Reduction Strategy, and incorporates long-term targets in Cambodia\u2019s Millennium \nDevelopment Goals, 2003 (updated in 2005). The NSDP has six pillars: (i) good governance, (ii) environment for the \nimplementation of the Rectangular Strategy, (iii) enhancement of the agricultural sector, (iv) continued rehabilitation \nand construction of physical infrastructure, (v) private sector growth and employment, and (iv) capacity building and \nhuman resources development. The NSDP places particular emphasis on agriculture, rural development, and \ninfrastructure. According to its indicative budget allocation, the NDSP allocates over 20% to the agriculture and rural \ndevelopment sector and 60% to rural areas. \n \nThe Government\u2019s commitment to decentralization is a key underlying theme of the above strategies/policies. An \nimportant feature of the Project will be increased alignment with the Strategic Framework for Decentralization and \nDeconcentration Reforms, 2005, which aims to channel a substantial amount of domestic resources and external \naid directly to support newly empowered subnational planning and budgeting units. The framework is a 5-year \nnational program to establish institutional capacity at provincial level, establishing provincial/municipal and district \ncouncils, and channeling development spending and capacity building to all levels of the subnational governance \nsystem. In line with the objectives of harmonization and the Government\u2019s wish to empower communes to plan and \nimplement subprojects, in collaboration with provincial technical departments, the implementation structure of the \nProject will be fully consistent with the framework.  \n \nB. Poverty Analysis                                                Targeting Classification: Targeted intervention \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed? \n \nThe proposed Project is an integral part of the Tonle Sap Initiative, an integrated program of technical assistance \n(TA), loan, and grant projects designed to assist Cambodia achieve the twin goals of improving the lives and \nlivelihoods of the population while protecting and conserving the unique biodiversity and environment of Tonle Sap.  \n \nThe proposed project design focuses on improving the livelihoods options for households inhabiting the lowland \narea stretching from the outer limit of the Tonle Sap Biosphere Reserve\u2019s buffer zone to the foothills of the upper \nwatershed area. It will target 40 poor communes on the Tonle Sap lowlandsa in the three lakeside provinces of \nKampong Chhnang, Kampong Thom, and Pursat where about 38% of the population falls under the official poverty \nline\u2014the highest proportion in the country. Some 50% of villages in these provinces have 40\u201360% of households \nliving below the poverty line, with a peak of 80% in parts of Kampong Chhnang. Many people in the rural \ncommunities reviewed during the rapid rural appraisal and participatory rural appraisal were found to be extremely \npoor and vulnerable to shocks. On average, over 50% of rural people do not grow enough rice to meet their needs; \nof these, half have to make up shortfalls of 3 or 4 months\u2019 supply, and shortfalls of 6 months or more are not \nuncommon for the remainder. They are also vulnerable to a variety of shocks: seasonal shortages of rainfall \n(especially at the beginning of the rainy season); seasonal shortages of water (especially drinking water during the \ndry season) and at the start and finish of both wet and dry rice crops; food shortages (especially shortfalls in the rice \nharvest caused by an unreliable supply of water); and seasonal trends that work against them (such as having to \nsell rice immediately after the harvest on a buyers\u2019 market). \nThe Project will support community mobilization for formulation of development plans and implementation of small-\n ", "  Appendix 11  55 \nscale infrastructure (irrigation, roads, village level postharvest facilities, and markets). It will also increase options for \npeople to develop the necessary skills and access additional financial resources to enable pursuit of new livelihood \nactivities. This will allow them to increase and stabilize rural incomes, and reduce the need for people to migrate \ninto the buffer zone and lake during the dry season. The ability of people living in the lowland communes to improve \ntheir livelihoods is constrained by: (i) poor rural infrastructure; and (ii) limited knowledge and access to improved \ntechnologies  and  techniques.  The  Government  and  farmers  consider  improvements  to  agricultural  water \nmanagement systems crucial to increasing agricultural, primarily rice, production; reducing susceptibility to droughts \nand floods; ensuring food security; and enabling agricultural diversification. Access to many villages is difficult, \nparticularly during the wet season, because the condition of rural roads is poor. Good access would enable \ngovernment services to be delivered to rural communities, farmers to buy agricultural inputs and to market surplus \nproduce, and rural people to access health services, education, and other amenities more easily. Other small-scale \ninfrastructure (such as schools, village offices, village meeting halls, markets, produce stores, and crop processing \nand packaging facilities) will improve the standard of living, support local livelihood activities, and aid community \ncohesion.  \n \nC. Participation Process \nIs there a stakeholder analysis?    Yes     No  \n \nIs there a participation strategy?     Yes                   No \n \nRural infrastructure needs at commune and village level will be identified and prioritized through the five-step \nCommune/Sangkat b planning process currently used to prepare 5-year commune development plans and annual \ncommune investment plans. This is a participatory process that involves communities in identifying their needs; and \nprovides for their direct involvement in resource allocation, decision making, implementation, and monitoring at the \nlocal level. With the exception of larger roads, communities will also have ownership of completed works, and \nresponsibility for their subsequent operation and maintenance (O&M). Social infrastructure subprojects seeking \nsupport from the Project will be identified by the commune council, included in the commune investment plan, and \nverified at the district integration workshop held in October each year. \n \nSupport will be provided to ensure full participation by all stakeholders (including intended beneficiaries) in the \nplanning, design, implementation, and operation of subprojects. The Project will utilize commune council supporters \nrecruited by the commune councils and trained by the Project to assist commune councils in designing and \nmanaging interventions funded through the Commune Development Fund (CDF). Commune council supporters are \nexpected to be the primary liaison with government departments within the province, facilitating their involvement in \nadvisory TA to the commune councils, village committees, and farmer water user committees (FWUCs).  \n \nD. Gender Development \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \n \nWomen in the project area are very vulnerable. They have less access to land ownership and other property rights, \ncredit, paid employment, education, and health services. They also have few opportunities for self-development or \nparticipation in community decision making since Khmer tradition ascribes a passive role to women. Nevertheless, \nthe gender division of labor is changing overall: women and men play progressively interchangeable roles because \nwomen are increasingly called upon to meet all household needs as men migrate for paid employment.  \n \nThere are also many displaced or disabled persons, who suffer from poverty and other forms of social deprivation \nmore than the rest of the population. At present, only about 3\u20135% of women participate in the committee farmer \nwater user group (FWUG). The Ministry of Water Resources and Meteorology (MOWRAM) is promoting women's \nparticipation in decision-making bodies at commune level to about 10% by 2010.  \n \nA gender action plan (GAP) has been prepared to ensure gender equality in the distribution of project benefits and \nto  enable  active  engagement  by  women  in  subproject  design  and  implementation.  The  implementation \narrangements and estimated costs of the GAP have been incorporated into the overall project design and costing. \nThe implementation schedule of the GAP will be in line with overall implementation of the Project.   \n \nHas an output been prepared?

Policy Framework and Entitlements \n2.  The resettlement framework (Supplementary Appendix H) is based on laws, regulations, \nand policies of the Government of Cambodia, principally the Constitution, 1993; the Land Law, \n2001; and related sub-decrees and regulations and Asian Development Bank (ADB) policies \nand guidelines. It was endorsed by the Government and guides the preparation of resettlement \nplans, if required during project implementation. In all instances where subprojects require land \nacquisition  and  resettlement,  the  provisions  and  principles  adopted  in  the  resettlement \nframework for the Project will supersede the provisions of relevant decrees currently in force in \nCambodia wherever a gap exists between government laws and regulations and ADB policies. \n3.  The entitlement matrix (Supplementary Appendix M) summarizes the main types of \nlosses  and  the  corresponding  nature  and  scope  of  entitlement.  The  extent  of  impact  on \nvulnerable  groups\u2014including  poor  households,  ethnic  minority  groups,  female-headed \nhouseholds,  landless  households,  disabled-headed  households,  and  elderly  people  without \nsupport structures\u2014will be determined during subproject preparation. The Project will pay due \nattention so that those vulnerable people will become subproject beneficiaries.   \nC.  Institutional Framework \n4.   The Ministry of Water Resources and Meteorology (MOWRAM), the Executing Agency \n(EA), through its project management office (PMO), will assure overall planning, coordination, \nand reporting of this resettlement framework. The EA will guide, support, endorse, and monitor \nthe work of the provincial resettlement subcommittee (PRS) in six participating provinces under \nthe guidance from the inter-ministerial resettlement committee. A PRS1 will be established in \neach of the three project target provinces. \n                                                 \n1  Membership will include directors of provincial departments involved in the project (provincial departments of water  \nresources and meteorology, rural development, and environment,) and a permanent deputy from target districts \n(district governors or deputy district governors).  \n \n ", "  Appendix 12  59 \n5.  In  each  province,  the  Provincial  Department  of  Water  Resources  and  Meteorology \n(PDWRAM)  and  Provincial  Department  of  Rural  Development  (PDRD)  will  appoint  a \nresettlement focal point with responsibility to screen resettlement impact. The resettlement focal \npoint, under guidance from the provincial resettlement subcommittee, will recruit contractors to \nprepare subproject resettlement plans. In each of the 40 target project communes, a commune \nland  acquisition  committee  (CLAC) 2  will  be  established,  which  will  (i)  confirm  that  no \nresettlement impact is foreseen in subprojects prepared under Commune Development Funds; \nand (ii) assist the resettlement focal point to consult, disclose, and monitor resettlement plans at \ncommune/village level.  \nD.  Preparation and Implementation of Resettlement Plans \n6.  Subproject screening will be undertaken through the following steps:  \n(i)  Social  infrastructure  (commune  livelihoods  funds).  In  the  commune \ninvestment  plans,  the  commune  council  will  confirm\u2014based  on  the  technical \noption selected on the preliminary subproject design and subproject categorization \nform\u2014that the subproject falls under category C (no resettlement impact). The \nresettlement  impact  categorization  form  must  be  attached  to  the  commune \ninvestment plan. The commune council chief has to certify that new facilities would \nbe constructed on unused public lands. In case it is decided that the subproject \nwould only require voluntary donation from the commune and/or any individual and \nnot  require  involuntary  resettlement,  the  commune  council  chief  also  has  to \ndescribe safeguard measures in the commune investment plan. For category B \nsubprojects, follow the procedure in para. 7. \n(ii)  Water  management  infrastructure/rural  roads  and  communication \ninfrastructure.  Based  on  the  technical  option  selected  and  the  preliminary \nsubproject design, the subproject falls under either category B (not significant \nresettlement impact) or C. The provincial level units PDWRAM and PDRD will \nscreen subprojects under this component and ensure that only subprojects whose \nresettlement impacts remain within the limits of a category B subproject will be \nfinanced by the Project.  \n7.  In each province, resettlement planning for all subprojects under category B that are \nprepared at the same time will be consolidated into a single commune land acquisition and \nresettlement plan (LARP) prepared by the PDWRAM and PDRD with assistance from the \nresettlement specialists and CLACs under the guidance of MOWRAM and PRS. The procedure \nfor preparation, finalization, and approval is as follows. \n(i)  PRS will recruit a professional appraiser to conduct a replacement cost survey in the \nsubproject areas once a year, to determine current market prices for agricultural, \nresidential, and commercial land; different types of structures; and crops and trees.  \n(ii)  In line with subproject (under Components 1 and 2) planning, the resettlement focal \npoint from the PDWRAM and PDRD with assistance from resettlement specialists \n(consultants), CLAC and village representatives under the guidance of PRS, will (a) \nundertake a census of all affected persons; (b) conduct a detailed measurement \nsurvey following the detailed design of the subproject and demarcation of land \n                                                 \n2  Membership of the commune land acquisition committee will include district, commune, and village representatives; \nrepresentatives of affected persons for subprojects; and a resettlement focal point from each implementing agency. \nTo address issues of vulnerable affected persons adequately, membership of the committee will include female \nand, as relevant, ethnic minority representatives. \n ", "60  Appendix 12 \nacquisition requirements; and (c) undertake a socioeconomic survey of at least 10% \nof all affected persons, and 20% of severely affected persons.  \n(iii)  Following the detailed measurement survey/socioeconomic survey or in conjunction \nwith it, the resettlement focal point from the PDWRAM and PDRD, assisted by \nresettlement specialists, will prepare a draft commune LARP, and compensation \nrates and amounts from the replacement cost survey. The official lists of affected \npersons, their losses, and compensation and assistance amounts will be appended \nto  the  draft  commune  LARP.  If  the  subproject  will  not  require  involuntary \nresettlement, a voluntary land donation report will be prepared and information will \nbe included in the commune LARP.  \n(iv)  The draft commune LARP will be presented to affected persons by the PDRAM and \nPDRD and other stakeholders in public meetings in villages and communes in the \nsubproject areas. Affected persons will be encouraged to raise issues and make \nsuggestions about land acquisition requirements, compensation rates and amounts, \nand other aspects of resettlement activities. Copies of the draft commune LARP \nand/or summary brochures will be available during these consultations. The draft \ncommune LARP will be made available to affected persons at village and commune \noffices in target communes.  \n(v)  The PDRAM and PDRD, assisted by resettlement specialists, will prepare the final \ncommune  LARP,  incorporating  comments  from  affected  persons  and  other \ndocuments;  and  submit  it  for  review  and  approval  to  the  provincial  rural \ndevelopment committee and PRS/interministerial resettlement committee (IRC). At \nthis stage, the PDRAM and PDRD or MOWRAM may consolidate several commune \nLARP into one provincial LARP to facilitate the review. MOWRAM and the PRS/IRC \nwill  submit  the  commune  or  provincial  LARP  to  IRC  and  ADB  for  review  and \napproval. The commune or provincial LARP will be disclosed in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Public Communications Policy (2005) to the affected communities and on the \nADB website after it has been approved. \n(vi)  Land  acquisition,  compensation,  and  relocation  of  affected  persons  cannot \ncommence  until  the  LARP  has  been  reviewed  and  approved  by  the  IRC,  and \napproval or no objection given by ADB. All resettlement activities will be coordinated \nwith the civil works schedule. Civil works contractors will not be issued a notice of \npossession of the site until (a) compensation and relocation of affected persons \nhave been satisfactorily completed, (b) agreed rehabilitation assistance is in place, \nand (c) the site is free of all encumbrances. \nE.  Consultation, Grievance Redress, and Disclosure \n8.  Consultation with affected persons will take place from the subproject preparation stage, \nand will be completed prior to finalization of detailed designs and resettlement plan so that their \nneeds and preferences can be incorporated into the design arrangements where practicable. \nThey will also participate in the various resettlement plan processes, including preparation of the \ninventory of losses, validation of compensation rates and entitlements, handover of entitlements, \nmonitoring of impacts and benefits, and discussion and settlement of grievances.  \n9.  To  ensure  that  all  grievances  of  those  affected  on  any  aspect  of  land  acquisition, \ncompensation, relocation, and determination and payment of entitlements are resolved in a \ntimely and satisfactory manner, and that all avenues for airing grievances are available, the \nProject will set up a mechanism to deal with any such grievances during project implementation. \nThe affected individuals will be made fully aware of their rights (both verbally and in writing) \n ", "  Appendix 12  61 \nduring consultations and at each phase of the resettlement process. Detailed procedures for \nhearing and redressing grievances, including appeal processes, will be made public through an \neffective public information campaign. The CLAC will record and report on all complaints and \ntheir  resolution.  The  independent  monitoring  agency  will  be  responsible  for  checking  the \nprocedures for and resolutions of grievances and complaints. \n10.  The  EA,  assisted  by  the  CLAC,  will  disclose  (i)  draft  resettlement  plans  prior  to \nsubmission for review and approval by ADB; (ii) final resettlement plans approved by ADB, and \n(iii) any revisions to the resettlement plans as a result of changes in scope or design layout. \nFinal and revised resettlement plans will be posted on ADB\u2019s website following ADB approval. \nKey information in the resettlement plans, including compensation and rehabilitation options, will \nbe disclosed to those affected before commencement of civil works. The information will be \nmade publicly available in a readily accessible location such as village and commune halls and \nbe in the form of an information leaflet or brochure\u2014all in a form and language that can be \nreadily understood by those affected.  \nF.  Monitoring and Evaluation \n11.  The  resettlement  focal  point  from  the  PDWRAM  and  provincial  rural  development \ncommittee,  assisted  by  consultants  and  CLACs,  will  supervise  the  preparation  and \nimplementation  of  the  subproject  resettlement  plan  and  will  monitor  and  report  on  all \nresettlement activities. The EA will consolidate all provincial reports into the project performance \nmonitoring system, which will be used to prepare regular progress reports for submission to \nADB. Monitoring and evaluation will focus on social impacts and whether the people affected \nare able to restore, and preferably improve on, their pre-project living standards, incomes, and \nproductive capacity. \n12.  The  EA  will  recruit  an  independent  monitoring  organization  to  conduct  external \nmonitoring and evaluation of resettlement, focusing on the social impacts of the Project and \nwhether affected persons are able to restore, and preferably improve, their pre-project living \nstandards,  incomes,  and  productive  capacity  about  12  months  after  compensation  and \nrelocation are completed. All independent monitoring organization reports will be submitted to \nADB. \nG.  Budget \n13.  All compensation for land and other affected assets will be paid at replacement cost \nbased  on  current  market  prices.  Compensation  rates  will  be  established  for  each  project \nprovince and approved by the PRS at replacement cost based on market prices during the \nreplacement cost survey. All costs for subproject resettlement programs under the Project, \nincluding  compensation  and  allowances,  operation  and  administration  costs,  surveys, \nmonitoring, and reporting will be financed by grant funds, with the exception of land acquisition. \nIf ADB funds are utilized, the resettlement plans will identify key activities for which the funds will \nbe used, any disbursal milestones, and auditing requirements that will facilitate appropriate and \ntimely delivery. \n ", "62  Appendix 13 \nGENDER ACTION PLAN \n \n1.  In Cambodia, women play vital roles in the economic activities of rural households. They \ncontribute significantly to the agricultural labor force, estimated to represent about 74% of male \nand 77% of female employment, mainly in rice production and fishery. They also engage in a \nwide range of livelihood activities, typically including collecting firewood for sale, running small \nbusinesses, and raising and selling livestock, which contribute to household income. In addition, \nwomen are predominately responsible for domestic chores such as cooking, taking care of \nchildren, and fetching water and fuel often from great distances. \n \n2.  Despite women\u2019s high contribution to household income, there is a continuing gender \ninequality in their access to paid employment, financial capital, and skills training. Women\u2019s \nparticipation in community decision making is also limited as Khmer tradition (Chbap Srey) \nascribes a passive role to women. At present, only about 3\u20135% of members of farmer water \nuser group (FWUG) committees are female. The Ministry of Water Resources and Meteorology \n(MOWRAM)  is  attempting  to  increase  women\u2019s  participation  in  decision-making  bodies  at \ncommune level to about 10% by 2010. \n \n3.  Poverty  in  the  project  area  has  strong  gender  dimensions.  In  the  project  target \ncommunes, the proportion of female-headed households ranges from 8% to 36% based on data \nfrom the 2005 Commune Database. Female-headed households are poorer\u2014they constitute \n41%  of  the  poor  and  32%  of  the  poorest  wealth  categories  compared  with  18%  of  rich \nhouseholds  and  24%  of  middle  wealth  households.  The  Tonle  Sap  participatory  poverty \nassessment also indicates that they are more vulnerable to external shocks and social stigma \nbecause of the lack of male labor in the household.   \n \n4.  This gender action plan (GAP) has been prepared to ensure gender equality in the \ndistribution of project benefits and to enable active engagement by women in subproject design \nand implementation. Gender responsive interventions will be selected to respond to the specific \nneeds of women in the project area. The implementation arrangements and estimated costs of \nthe GAP have been incorporated in the overall project design and costing. The implementation \nschedule of the GAP will be in line with the overall implementation of the Project. The key \nprinciples underlining the GAP are as follows.  \n \n(i)  Subproject  preparation.  The  Project  will  engage  both  female  and  male  commune \nfacilitators to the extent possible. Separate meetings for men and women will be held \nduring subproject preparation so that women will be fully informed about the Project and \ncan  express  their  needs  and  preferred  technical  options.  Women  will  be  consulted \nbefore  deciding  on  infrastructure  locations  and  design.  The  Project  will  recruit  an \ninternational  community  development  specialist  (6  person-months,  intermittent)  with \ngender  background  and  expertise  to  ensure  that  this  GAP  will  be  appropriately \nimplemented by commune facilitators. \n(ii)  Subproject  implementation.  The  Project  will  engage  female  trainers  to  the  extent \npossible. During subproject construction, the Project will also hire women, particularly \nfemale-headed households and poor women (at least 35% of unskilled laborers on \nproject investments are expected to be women because men migrate to work outside the \ncommunes), and ensure equal pay for men and women for work of equal value. The \nProject will work to increase the participation of women in commune decision making: a \nminimum of 30% female representation in all commune committees and groups will be \ntargeted in project communes.  \n(iii)  Training. The Project will recruit a national gender specialist (12 months, intermittent) so \nthat gender sensitization and training in gender-sensitive design will be provided during \n ", "                                 Appendix 13       63 \nproject orientation in the inception phase for all levels of project staff, implementation \nconsultants,  contractors,  commune  facilitators,  commune  councilors,  and  other \nstakeholders in order to emphasize the link between the GAP and project performance. \nThe sessions on gender analysis and gender-sensitive monitoring indicators will be \nincluded in project management training for project staff and commune councilors to \npromote  gender-responsive  subproject  preparation,  implementation,  monitoring,  and \nreporting. \n(iv)  Monitoring  and  Evaluation.  Gender-disaggregated  data  will  be  collected  during \nsubproject  preparatory  surveys  (e.g.,  baseline  survey  and  household  surveys). \nSubproject feasibility studies will include gender-disaggregated and/or gender-specific \ntargets and indicators, and those indicators will be monitored and reported in project \nquarterly progress monitoring reports. MOWRAM\u2019s Gender Unit will be involved during \nproject review missions. A senior representative of the Ministry of Women\u2019s Affairs will \nparticipate  in  the  project  steering  committee  to  ensure  that  the  executing  and \nimplementing agencies are aware of national gender action plans and commitments.  \n(v)  Resettlement.  At  all  stages  involving  involuntary  resettlement,  resettlement \nidentification, planning and management, the Project will ensure that gender concerns \nare  incorporated\u2014including  gender-specific  consultation  and  information  disclosure. \nThis includes special attention to guarantee women\u2019s assets, property, and land-use \nrights; and to ensure the restoration of their income and living standards. Resettlement \nplanning and monitoring documents will include gender-disaggregated data. \n \nTable A13: Gender Action Plan \n \nComponent  Actions Proposed \nOutput 1: Rural  \u2022  Female  commune  facilitators  (1  female  and  1  male  commune  facilitator  per \nInfrastructure  commune)  will  be  hired  to  enable  women\u2019s  participation  during  subproject \n\u2022  Improvement and  preparation so that the commune investment plan can reflect women\u2019s preferences. \nDevelopment of  Gender-sensitization training will be part of project orientation training for project \nCommunity-Driven  staff, contractors, consultants, male and female commune facilitators, commune \nSocial Infrastructure  councilors, and other stakeholders involved in subproject preparation. \n(e.g., village  \u2022  Separate meetings for women and men related to subproject preparation will be \nmarkets, village  held. Women will be fully informed about the Project, including their expected \nroads, and  contributions. They will be consulted on the location and design of facilities.  \ndrainage) \n\u2022  Female commune assistants will help women in each village to select their female \n \nrepresentatives; these representatives will participate in the consolidation of the \n\u2022  Improvement of  commune investment plan to ensure that women\u2019s interests are included; then, they \nAgricultural Water  will brief their constituents on the ongoing and planned activities.  \nManagement \n\u2022  At least 30% of training participants related to operation and maintenance (O&M) of \nInfrastructure  \nselected infrastructure, including the O&M transfer strategy, will be women. \n \n\u2022  Gender-sensitive training material in local languages, predominantly Khmer, will be \n\u2022  Improvement of \nprepared in close consultation with beneficiaries, particularly women.  \nRural Roads and \nCommunication  \u2022  The extent of women\u2019s participation will be monitored and incorporated in the \nInfrastructure  project  progress  reports  by  the  provincial  gender  focal  points  and  project \nmanagement office (PMO) member responsible for gender.  \n\u2022  At least one committee member will be female and all groups (e.g., farmer water \nuser group, rural road maintenance committee) will have a minimum of 30% female \nmembers. \n\u2022  Affected women will be fully informed about the Project, its expected impact, and \ntheir entitlements during implementation of the resettlement plan. Special attention \nwill  be  given  to  women  in  severely  affected  households  and  female-headed \nhouseholds.  \n\u2022  The Project will ensure that contractors\u2019 agreements contain (i) compulsory gender \nsensitization training for both male and female construction workers, and (ii) an \nappropriate clause promoting the hiring of women (35% of the unskilled laborers will \nbe women) and equal pay for men and women for work of equal value. \n ", "64  Appendix 13 \nComponent  Actions Proposed \nOutput 2: Rural  \u2022  Nongovernment organizations and microfinance institutions with a good gender and \nLivelihood Options  development  record  will  be  encouraged  to  provide  financial  and/or  technical \nIncreased  services in project areas. \n\u2022  Technical Services  \u2022  Gender-sensitive training material in local languages will be prepared in close \n  consultation with beneficiaries, particularly women. \n\u2022  Provision of services to women will be encouraged so that at least 30% of project \nbeneficiaries will be women. The extent of women\u2019s participation will be monitored \nand incorporated in the project progress reports. \n\u2022  At least 30% of the female beneficiaries will be included as participants of training \non  matters  related  to  MFIs  (i.e.,  how  to  develop  a  business  plan,  MFI \nrequirements), conducted by an experienced and gender-sensitive consultant or \nNGO. \n\u2022  Separate meetings will be organized for women and men to get their views on \ncategories of on-farm training needs (i.e., kinds of crops, livestock techniques). On-\nfarm training activities, to the extent feasible, will be held in the village or commune \nand at times convenient to women to enable at least 30% female participation. \n\u2022  A consultant will be hired to conduct an assessment of the local market needs. This \nwill help in designing off-farm training for male and female beneficiaries, and in \ngetting at least 30% female trainees. \nOutput 3: Program  \u2022  The PMO and project director will be responsible for overseeing the implementation \nManagement  of the gender action plan (GAP) and reporting on gender-related achievements in \nquarterly progress reports to the Asian Development Bank (ADB).   \n\u2022  The terms of reference of the implementation consultants\u2019 team leader will include \nresponsibility  for  ensuring  smooth  implementation  of  the  GAP  and  gender-\nresponsive quarterly progress reports to ADB \n\u2022  A representative of the Ministry of Water Resources and Meteorology (MOWRAM) \nGender  Unit  will  be  appointed  a  member  of  the  PMO,  with  responsibility  for \nscreening  subprojects  from  a  gender-responsiveness  perspective,  monitoring \nimplementation of the GAP, and quarterly gender-disaggregated reporting.  \n\u2022  If the project hires two commune facilitators per commune, one facilitator will be \nfemale. \n\u2022  Each implementing agency at the provincial level should appoint a project staff \nmember  to  be  the  gender  focal  point,  with  responsibility  for  monitoring \nimplementation of the GAP and for reporting gender-related achievements and \nconstraints to the PMO. \n\u2022  The terms of reference of all consultants will include responsibilities to ensure \nimplementation of the GAP related to their work.  \n\u2022  Gender-sensitization training will be carried out as part of the project orientation for \nall levels of staff, consultants, contractors, commune facilitators, and commune \ncouncilors to make them aware of the GAP and receive their participation in \ndeveloping its implementation plan (i.e., who is responsible for which activity at \neach level, and the time frame for each activity).     \n\u2022  Both female and male staff will be given equal opportunity to participate in non-\ngender related training and capacity development programs. \n\u2022  An international community development specialist with a gender background and a \nnational gender consultant will be recruited to (i) build the capacity of PMO, project \nstaff,  and  commune  facilitators  in  gender-responsive  design  and  analysis; \n(ii) preparation of gender-sensitive indicators; and (iii) preparation of checklists for \nevaluation of the gender responsiveness of proposed subprojects. \n\u2022  Gender-disaggregated indicators will be established for the project performance \nmonitoring  and  evaluation  system.  Monitoring  will  be  ongoing  to  ensure  that \nactivities are carried out effectively and targets reached. Progress reports will \ninclude  gender-related  achievements  (e.g.,  level  of  participation  of  women  in \nmeetings and committee decisions) and constraints. \n\u2022  The  Midterm  Review  Mission  will  assess  gender-related  achievements  and \nconstraints to GAP implementation, and propose adjustments for better project \nperformance. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n "], "metadata": {"ModDate": "D:20071210142507+08'00'", "CreationDate": "D:20071114154505+08'00'", "Title": "Tonle Sap Lowlands Rural Development Project", "Creator": "PScript5.dll Version 5.2", "Author": "Cbr", "Producer": "Acrobat Distiller 6.0 (Windows)", "Keywords": "rrp: 37287 cam, tonle sap lowlands rural development, rural infrastructure"}, "author_page": "manner.
