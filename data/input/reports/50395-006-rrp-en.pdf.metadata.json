The project will \nsupport  the  construction  and/or  upgrading  of  new  facilities  that  incorporate  green-building  and \nclimate-proofing design features. The project will strengthen staff capacity at the universities and \nsupport demand-driven quality education and research aligned with local economic priorities. It \nwill integrate new technologies in teaching programs, strengthen technical and vocational teacher \neducation, and help the government develop a medium-term higher-education investment plan. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\n \nRationale \n\nA. \n \n3. \nStrategic context. The government seeks to accelerate economic growth by promoting \ntechnology-intensive  industries,  infrastructure  development,  and  high-end  services,  while \ntransforming  agriculture  and  fisheries.  Indonesia\u2019s  manufacturing  industry  aims  to  grow  and \nintegrate new technologies to increase productivity. New technologies such as big data, robotics, \nand the internet of things will transform the economy, and can create new industries and better-\nquality jobs, and thus, increase labor productivity. However, these new technologies will alter the \nskills required of the workforce, leading to lower wage growth for less-skilled laborers, or even \nloss of employment to automation, thereby exacerbating income inequality. Already, demand for \njobs that require non-routine cognitive tasks have grown faster than jobs requiring routine and \nmanual tasks. Without adequate skills development or retraining, workers with weaker skills face \nhurdles in seizing the opportunities that new technologies provide. As of end-2017, only 11% of \nthe labor force had completed higher education, and in 2017 fewer than 20% of graduates held \ndegrees in technology-relevant fields like engineering\u2014with few women among them. Half of the \nlabor  force  is  underqualified  for  the  jobs  they  are  performing.  About  10%  of  the  labor  force  is \noverqualified,  most  of  whom  hold  degrees,  indicating  an  increasing  risk  of  mismatch  between \ndemand  and  supply.  Indonesia  needs  more  higher-education  graduates\u2014both  men  and \nwomen\u2014with degrees that better match emerging opportunities in the labor market.1 \n \nHigher  education  needs  to  accommodate  an  increasing  volume  of  students.  The \n4. \ngross rate of enrollment in higher education increased from 17% in 2004 to 31% in 2018, with \nstudent numbers increasing from 4.0 million to 7.5 million.2 Advanced skills education is provided \nby  higher-education  institutions  (HEIs)  such  as  universities  and  polytechnics.  The  Ministry  of \nResearch, Technology and Higher Education (MORTHE) administers public HEIs and licenses \n3 From  2004  to  2018,  the  number  of  students  per  public  HEI  grew  significantly, \nprivate  HEIs.F\n\n                                                \n1  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB).  2017.  Asian  Development  Outlook  2017.  Manila;  ADB.  2018.  Asian  Development \nOutlook  2018.  Manila;  and  ADB.  2018.  Indonesia:  Enhancing  Productivity  through  Quality  Jobs.  Manila.  The \nunemployment rate for higher-education graduates in 2017 was 8.7%, a slight decrease from 9.9% in 2016. \n\n2  Women enrollment in higher education is 50.2%. Women enroll less in engineering and more in education and health. \nWomen face difficulties finding formal employment and are paid less than equally educated men for comparable jobs. \n3  Nine years of basic education and three years of general and vocational secondary education is under the auspices of \nthe Ministry of Education and Culture (MOEC), with administration of schools decentralized to districts and provinces. \nEducation with more extensive religious content is provided by education institutions under the Ministry of Religious \n\n \n\n \n\n\fresulting in very crowded institutions. During the same period the number of private HEIs grew \nsignificantly to accommodate more students. While Indonesia has made significant progress in \nproviding access to higher education, additional effort is needed to meet growing public demand. \n \n5. \nEducation  and  research  in  higher-education institutions  do  not meet  current  and \nfuture industry needs. Indonesia\u2019s labor force is underqualified. Employers indicate that higher- \neducation  graduates  lack  reasoning,  problem  solving,  and  teamwork  skills.  Curricula  need  to \nfocus more on practical and soft skills like communication, teamwork, and work ethic, and should \nbe  updated  more  regularly.  With  a  few  notable  exceptions,  HEIs  do  not  benefit  from  links  to \nindustry and rely for the most part on traditional lectures. Teachers lack the skills to adopt modern \nteaching techniques that integrate practical skills training with theoretical content. Few HEI staff \nhave doctoral degrees. Moreover, the sharp increase in enrollment has led public HEIs to recruit \nmore temporary, less-qualified staff and to focus mainly on education and neglecting research. \nPublic  HEIs  are  often  overcrowded  and  have  outdated  and/or  inadequate  equipment,  lecture \nhalls, and laboratories. \n \n6. \nHigher-education institutions outside Java need to improve to support local society \nand  the  economy.  Of  Indonesia\u2019s  122  public  HEIs,  40%  are  in  Java,  and  so  are  nine  of \nIndonesia\u2019s top-10 public universities. HEIs outside Java cater to poorer parts of the country. They \nare  rated  lower  in  quality,  have  limited  financial  resources,  fewer  qualified  staff,  and  hardly \nconduct  any  research.  With  adequate  investment  in  facilities  and  human  resources,  the  HEIs \noutside Java can play an important role in the local economy. They can provide the advanced \nskills  needed  for  inclusive  economic  growth,  collaborate  with  local  industry  to  introduce  new \ntechnologies, and enable a more diverse array of students to attend high-quality universities. \n \n7. \nHigher  education  needs  to  provide  better  teachers  to  meet  growing  demand  for \ntechnical  education.  Senior  secondary  vocational  education  (SMK)  students  are  not  as \nemployable as they should be, and thus the quality and relevance of SMK education needs to \nimprove.4 Teachers  at  SMK  schools  and HEIs  lack the  practical  skills  and industry  experience \nneeded for the technical subjects they teach. They rely mainly on traditional lectures, instead of \nusing more  interactive,  inquiry-based teaching methods.5 Employment  rules for teachers focus \non  academic  qualifications,  which  hampers  recruitment  of  teachers  with  practical  experience. \nOnly  20%  of  SMK  vocational  subject  teachers  have  the  required  qualifications,  implying  that \n90,000  of  such teachers  require  skills  improvement. Teaching universities  and  institutions  lack \nadequate  programs,  facilities,  and  industry  linkages,  and  are  ill-prepared  to  integrate  new \ntechnologies  to  prepare  teachers  for  the  changing  needs  of  technical  education.  Indonesia \nurgently  requires  better  SMK  teachers,  as  the  number  of  SMKs  and  students  has  increased \nsignificantly since 2012.6 In response, the MORTHE and the Ministry of Education and Culture \n(MOEC)  have  introduced  programs  to  strengthen  teacher  education.  This  includes  changing \n\n                                                \n\nAffairs. Private providers enroll 73% of Indonesia\u2019s 7.6 million HEI students and manage 90% of the 4,150 HEIs. The \nMORTHE oversees 122 public and 3,152 private HEIs. The 96 public and 1,019 private HEIs overseen by the Ministry \nof Religious Affairs enroll 700,000 students. The four project-supported universities are public institutions under the \nMORTHE. Private HEIs tend not to offer expensive courses, like engineering. \n\n4  68% of SMK graduates are employed\u201479% of men and 52% of women. \n5  SMKs provide high school diplomas in technical education; HEIs provide diplomas and degrees in technical subjects. \n6  SMKs  teach  general  and  vocational  subjects.  The  general  senior  secondary  schools  teach  general  academic \nsubjects.  In  2017,  SMKs  enrolled  50.7%  (4.7  million)  of  senior  secondary  students,  overtaking  general  senior \nsecondary enrollment for the first time. The number of SMK schools grew from 10,670 in 2012 to 13,710 in 2017. \nIndonesia prioritized teachers. From 2003 to 2015, 30% more teachers were employed compared with  25% more \nstudents. The share of teachers with the minimum bachelor\u2019s degree increased from 37% in 2003 to 90% in 2016. \nQuality of teachers remains an issue; when tested on a 100-point scale, average result was 53. \n\n2 \n\n \n\n \n\n\femployment  rules  to  allow  people  with  industry  backgrounds  to  become  teachers.  Given  the \nurgent need for more and better technical-and-vocational-education-and-training (TVET) teachers, \nthe  MORTHE  and  MOEC  are  preparing  a  strategy  to  educate  TVET  teachers,  which  includes \nintegrating pre- and in-service training and increasing industry involvement.7 \n \n8. \nEfforts to improve quality and relevance need to become more effective. The higher \neducation quality assurance mechanism and the Indonesian qualification framework (IQF) are the \ntwo main instruments to improve the quality and relevance of higher education. HEIs also operate \ntheir own internal quality assurance systems. An independent panel is in charge of assessing and \naccrediting  HEIs  at  the  program  level  and  at  the  institution  level.  From  2019,  the  national \naccreditation body for higher education will introduce an improved instrument to assess HEIs at \nthe  institution  level.  The  new  instrument  will  focus  on  performance  and  processes.8 Under  the \nIQF,  which  came  into  effect  in  2012,  national  qualification  standards  for  occupations  are \ndeveloped with inputs from industry to ensure that the education and training institutions provide \nskills development which meets industry needs. The IQF is meant to be the unifying framework \nfor skills development. While progress has been made, the system needs to be strengthened so \nthat  IQF  certificates  issued  under  the  national  assessment  and  accreditation  system  become \nnationally\u2014and possibly internationally\u2014accepted.9 \n \n9. \nThe  government\u2019s  strategy.  Higher  education  is  a  priority  for  the  government.  The \nNational Medium-Term Development Plan, 2015\u20132019, the MORTHE\u2019s strategy for 2015\u20132019, \nand  the  presidential  decree  on  strengthening  vocational  education  set  out  the  directions  to \nimprove the quality and relevance of higher education.10 The government will focus on improving \naccess to and the quality of science, engineering, agriculture, and health education and research; \nestablishing  stronger  collaboration  with  industry;  and  strengthening  teacher  quality.  The \nMORTHE\u2019s  investment  program  aims  to  strengthen  the  capacity  of  HEIs  to  meet  increased \ndemand  for  higher  education.  HEIs  outside  Java  are  included  in  the  investment  to  ensure \nequitable growth. The MORTHE expects each university to become a center of excellence in a \nspecific academic discipline to meet current and future (local) economic needs. The government \nis preparing its National Medium-Term Development Plan, 2020\u20132024, with a strong focus on the \nrole of higher education to support technological change, innovation, and entrepreneurship. As \npart of the 2020\u20132024 plan, the MORTHE will prepare a medium-term investment plan for higher \neducation. This investment plan will aim to accelerate innovation in new technology and stimulate \nentrepreneurship at top universities, and will also target the development of advanced skills at \nregional universities so local economies can also benefit from the technological transformation. \n \nFinancing requirements for upgrading higher-education institutions. Since 2010, the \n10. \ngovernment has allocated 20% of the national budget to education, with the MORTHE receiving \nabout 10% of the education budget. This includes revenue that public universities gain from tuition \nand  other  resources.  However,  this  budget  is  insufficient  to  upgrade  facilities  to  offer  quality \n                                                \n7  Pre-service teacher education is the responsibility of the MORTHE. Core policies are the Vocational Higher Education \nRevitalization Program (2016) and the Teacher Training Institution Revitalization Strategy (2016). In-service training of \nSMK  teachers  is  the  responsibility  of  the  MOEC,  including  retraining  90,000  teachers  trained  to  teach  the  general \nsubjects in SMKs into vocational subject teachers (footnote 6). \n\n8  This updated instrument will be used in the project universities to measure progress in quality of education. \n9  As  of  2018,  about  40%  of  Indonesia\u2019s  160  industry  associations  have  professional  certification  bodies  attached. \nThose  bodies  have  developed  1,720  qualification  schemes,  of  which  only  about  13%  can  be  properly  labeled \nqualification standards (the others need to be improved). \n\n10 Government  of  Indonesia,  National  Development  Planning  Agency  (BAPPENAS).  2015.  National  Medium-Term \nDevelopment  Plan  (RPJMN),  2015\u20132019.  Jakarta.  MORTHE.  2015.  Strategic  plan,  2015-2019.  Jakarta.  The \nPresidential Decree No. 9/2016. Revitalization of Vocational Education. 2016. \n\n \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\feducation  to  an  increased  number  of  students,  especially  for  public  HEIs  outside  Java,  which \nhave  fewer  revenue-generating  options.  Hence,  development  partners  are  financing  the  HEI \nupgrades. 11  As  part  of  the  initiative,  the  MORTHE  has  requested  support  from  the  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  to  upgrade  four  public  universities:  the  University  of  Malikussaleh \n(UNIMAL), the University of Jambi (UNJA), and the University of Riau (UNRI) all in Sumatra; and \nthe Indonesia University of Education (UPI) in Bandung, West Java. \n \n11. \nThe Sumatran universities are mid-tier universities providing higher education to support \neconomic development in their regions. Financing is needed to provide lecture halls, laboratories, \nand other facilities to meet increased demand for higher education, improve quality and relevance \nof education and research, and ensure an inclusive, conducive, and gender-friendly teaching and \nlearning environment. UNIMAL caters mainly to students from East Aceh, a post-conflict and post-\ntsunami  area  in  which  agriculture  is  the  main  economic  activity.  It  will  focus  on  sustainable \nagriculture to support local farmers and small agribusiness. UNJA, the only public university in \npoor but natural-resources-rich Jambi Province, will focus on sustainable management of natural \nresources to support the province\u2019s transformation from an extractive to a sustainable economy. \nUNRI, located in Riau Province, which has seen strong economic growth, aims to strengthen its \ncapacity in aquatic and marine science to accommodate agribusiness companies, related service \nindustries, and farmers.12 \n \n12.  UPI, a teaching university, will become a center of excellence for educating TVET teachers. \nThe center will prepare TVET teachers to teach emerging technologies to meet current and future \nindustry needs. The center will collaborate with other universities that specialize in TVET-teacher \neducation; with other HEIs in Bandung; and with SMKs, the MORTHE, and the MOEC. UPI will \nestablish a special unit to strengthen industry relationships within the center of excellence. \n \n13. \nLessons  learned.  The  project  design  incorporated  lessons  learned  from  the  ADB-\nsupported Polytechnic Education Development Project and the Education Sector Analytical and \nCapacity  Development  Partnership.  First,  programs  designed  by  industry  and  individual  HEIs \ngenerally produce better results. Second, to reform an institution, a piece meal approach focusing \nat a few programs is not sustainable. The design should address all stakeholders and units within \nan organization, and ensure interconnectivity between these units so reforms reinforce each other \nand sustain. Third, education institutions should design their skills development programs based \non the skills needs of the local industry, as each location and each industry is unique..\n \nB. \n \n14. \nThe project is aligned with the following impact: increased income and productivity of the \nworking  age  population.14 The  project  will  have  the  following  outcome:  strengthened  access, \nrelevance, and quality of targeted universities.15 \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n13 \n\n                                                \n11 The  Islamic  Development  Bank,  the  Kreditanstalt  f\u00fcr  Wiederaufbau  (Germany),  and  the  Japan  International \nCooperation Agency also support the upgrade of universities.

This output will increase access to \nhigher  education  by  expanding  and  improving  the  physical  capacity  of  the  three  targeted \nuniversities in Sumatra: UNIMAL, UNJA, and UNRI. The project will support construction of new \nlecture  halls,  laboratories,  and  other  buildings  with  climate-proofing  design  features,  and  will \nsupport the completion of one unfinished building at UNIMAL. Construction of this building was \nnot  completed  due  to  shortage  of  financing.  All  facilities  constructed  and/or  upgraded  will  be \ngender-responsive, inclusive, and sustainable. Each university will construct or upgrade new day-\ncare centers, lactation rooms, and related facilities. To improve the quality of higher education, \nthe  capacity  of  university  staff  will  be  strengthened  through  international  and  national  training, \ninternships,  and  joint  research  projects.  To  improve  the  relevance  of  higher  education,  UNJA, \nUNIMAL,  and  UNRI  will  establish  centers  of  excellence  in,  respectively,  sustainable  natural \nresources, sustainable agriculture, and marine and aquatic science in collaboration with industry, \ncommunity,  and  other  stakeholders.  Each  center  will  work  closely  with  local  industry  and \ncommunities to identify how they can address local economic needs. For example, UNIMAL is in \ndialogue with local industry on developing new seeds and better fertilizer. UNJA aims the use of \nnew sustainable land management methods like agroforestry. UNRI is focusing on modernizing \napplied food technology for local industry. A separate technical assistance (TA) is proposed to \nsupport the MORTHE with the medium-term higher-education investment plan development as \ncalled for in the National Medium-Term Development Plan, 2020\u20132024 (para. 9).16 \n \n17. \nOutput  2:  Training  of  technical-and-vocational-education-and-training  teachers \nimproved. This output will improve the quality of technical education by turning UPI into a center \nof excellence for the education of TVET teachers. Civil works will include classrooms, laboratories, \na day care center, and other academic buildings. All constructed and upgraded facilities will be \ngender-responsive,  inclusive,  and  sustainable.  The  capacity  of  university  staff  will  be \nstrengthened.  The  center  of  excellence  will  establish  bachelor\u2019s-level  TVET-teacher-education \nprograms related to six emerging technologies (i) information systems and technology, including \nbig  data;  (ii)  artificial  intelligence  and  robotics;  (iii)  industrial  instrumentation  engineering;  (iv) \nrenewable energy engineering; (v) chemical engineering; and (vi) automotive engineering. As part \nof its TVET education research, UPI will develop new models for TVET education, focusing on \nimproved  industry  collaboration,  resource  sharing,  and  introduction  of  new  teaching\u2013learning \npractices.  UPI  will  develop  and  implement  in-service  SMK  teacher  training  programs  in \ncollaboration with the MOEC, polytechnics, SMKs, and industry. UPI will become a professional \ncertification body and a center for competency testing, able to provide IQF certificates. To address \nthe need for more and better TVET teachers , the proposed separate TA will support the MORTHE \nand MOEC to develop a medium-term strategy to educate TVET teachers (footnote 16). \n \n18. \nADB added value. In addition to financing, ADB will add value by building links to industry \nin  research  and  education.  ADB  will  emphasize  new  technologies  to  improve  relevance  of \neducation  and  research.  ADB  will  improve  quality  assurance  and  monitoring  of  relevance  of \n\n                                                \n16  A separate technical assistance (TA) is proposed to be financed by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction to support \nproject  implementation.  The  TA  will  assist  development  of  centers  of  excellence  and  strengthen  international \nnetworks. The TA will also support the development of the medium-term higher-education investment plan and the \nmedium-term strategy to educate TVET teachers. \n\n \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\neducation  and  research,  and  strengthen  collaboration  with  external  and  international  partners \nfrom Australia, Germany, Malaysia, Singapore, and Taipei,China. In addition, ADB will also help \nincorporate green-building and climate-proofing design features. Through the separate TA, ADB \nwill support the development of a medium-term higher-education investment plan (footnote 16). \nThe project is fully aligned with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 (Table 1).17 \n \n\nStrategy 2030 Priorities \n\n1.

These measures include detailed engineering designs to address \nincreased  temperatures,  and  they  meet  or  exceed  earthquake  codes,  energy  efficiency,  and \nminimal-waste  concept.  Project  designers  have  also  modified  campus  designs  to  address \nseasonal flooding and to mitigate potential water shortages. \n \nB. \n \nEconomic analysis. The economic internal rate of return is estimated at 13%, which is \n25. \nabove the 6% threshold for social sector projects. The principal benefits considered in the analysis \nwere wages for graduates across different scenarios. Wages for SMK students benefitting from \nimproved  TVET  teachers  were  also  examined.  The  principal  costs  are civil  works,  equipment, \nopportunity cost of attending universities (wages to be earned by secondary-education graduates \nand out-of-pocket expenses), replacement of laboratory equipment, and recurrent costs including \nsalary and maintenance. Analysis shows that the overall investment would remain economically \nviable in a range of contexts, including a 10% capital cost overrun and a 10% decrease in benefits. \n \n26. \nFinancial  sustainability.  The  four  universities  are  financed  through  an  annual  budget \nthat includes nontax revenue from tuition and other income, and central government budget from \ntax revenue. The central government and the universities have committed adequate counterpart \nfinancing during implementation. Financing for post-implementation is expected to be sustainable. \nThe government\u2019s commitment to allocate at least 20% of the budget to education will ensure that \nthe allocation is stable. Improving tax collection is a government priority and will minimize the risk \nthat overall revenue increases too slowly to accommodate the post-implementation requirement \nfrom the central budget. Nontax revenue is expected to increase due to growth in student numbers \nand research activities.  \n \nC. \n \n27. \nFinancial management. The financial management risk is moderate. The MORTHE and \nthe universities have adequate financial management systems in place and have experience with \nimplementing  externally  funded  projects,  although  they  do  not  have  experience  with  ADB-\nfinanced projects. Delays in receiving budget allocations are possible as the annual allocation for \nall loan financing is capped. Delays can also occur because of the differing legal status of the \nuniversities, which forces them to use different financial management procedures. However, ADB, \nMORTHE, and the universities can mitigate these risks through close monitoring of expenditures, \nbudget planning, prudent project planning, capacity development, and consultant support. \n \n28. \nProcurement. The procurement capacity assessment concluded that the MORTHE and \nthe  four  universities  have  the  capacity  to  carry  out  the  project,  subject  to  the  enforcement  of \nfiduciary controls and timely decision making by the procurement committees in the universities. \nTo strengthen procurement capacity, ADB and consultants will provide in-country support, advice, \nand training for the project management unit (PMU) and project implementation unit (PIU). The \nPMU  will  perform quality  assurance  to  ensure that  procurement  complies with  ADB  guidelines \nand is carried out in a timely manner. An experienced procurement consultant will strengthen the \nPMU  to  coordinate  and  provide  additional  technical  support  and  monitoring  of  the  PIUs.  All \nprocurement  of  works,  goods,  and  services  will  follow  the  ADB  Procurement  Policy  (2017,  as \n\nGovernance \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\fSafeguards \n\nPoverty, Social, and Gender \n\namended  from  time  to  time)  and  the  Procurement  Regulations  for  ADB  Borrowers  (2017,  as \namended from time to time). \n \n29. \nAnticorruption. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained \nto and discussed with the government and the MORTHE. The specific policy requirements and \nsupplementary measures are described in the PAM. \n \nD. \n \n30. \nAs the government provides scholarship programs, more poor and disadvantaged youth \nare enrolling in higher education. Improved market orientation of programs, better TVET teachers \nin  relevant  subject  areas,  and  increased  enrollment  will  reduce  youth  unemployment.  More \nwomen enroll in the four universities than men. However, transition to the labor market is more \nchallenging for women in some disciplines. The project is categorized as gender equity theme, \nand a gender action plan has been prepared.20 The project will ensure (i) integration of gender-\nresponsive physical design features into the construction of facilities in the universities (new day-\ncare  centers,  separate  and  special-needs  toilets,  and  safe  and  accessible  buildings);  (ii)  fair \nparticipation of male and female staff in capacity development programs; (iii) conducting gender \nanalysis and research with the university gender study centers; and (iv) training of TVET teacher \ninstructors in gender-responsive and gender-inclusive teaching and learning methods. \n \nE. \n \n31. \ncategories are as follows.21  \n \n32. \nEnvironment (category B). The project will develop lecture rooms, teaching laboratories, \nand other academic facilities across seven campuses of four universities. An initial environmental \nexamination  (IEE)  was  prepared  and  disclosed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy \nStatement and the applicable national environment requirements.22 The universities carried out \nmeaningful  consultations  with  stakeholders,  including  residents,  university  staff,  students,  and \npublic  and  private  local  agencies.  The  IEE  identifies  environmental  impacts  and  mitigation \nmeasures for construction and operations with regard to (i) waste management, (ii) air quality and \nnoise,  and  (iii)  occupational  and  community  health  and  safety.  The  project  is  category  B  as \nenvironmental impacts are location-specific, can be readily mitigated, and the locations are not \necologically  sensitive  or  high  risk  with  respect  to  community  health  and safety.  The  PMU  and \nPIUs will undertake environmental management and monitoring during implementation. The IEE \nproposes (i) capacity building for the PMU and PIUs, including consultant support; (ii) inclusion of \nan environmental management plan in bidding documents; and (iii) inspection and supervision \nduring  construction.  At  the  detailed  engineering  design  stage,  the  PMU  will  update  the  IEE  to \nreflect the detailed design and national approval requirements and seek ADB approval. The PMU \nwill ensure effective environmental monitoring at all stages of project implementation. University \nmanagement, supported by PIUs, and the PMU will be responsible for any grievances. \n \n33. \ncampuses. Involuntary resettlement as per ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement is not triggered. \n\nIn  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),  the  project\u2019s  safeguard \n\nInvoluntary resettlement (category C).
