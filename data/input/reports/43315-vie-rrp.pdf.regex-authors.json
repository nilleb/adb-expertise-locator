The VIE-CS is to be provided as a single tranche under the \nCountercyclical Support Facility (CSF) of the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB). \n   \nClassification  Targeting Classification: General intervention \nSector (subsector): Public sector management (economic and public \naffairs management) \nTheme (subtheme): Economic growth (promoting macroeconomic \nstability) \nLocation impact: National (high) \n   \nEnvironment  Category C \nAssessment \n   \nThe Program  The global economic downturn, triggered by the collapse of the US \nRationale  subprime mortgage market, has turned into one of the sharpest global \neconomic recessions in modern history. Most developed economies are \nin  deep  recession  in  2009,  and  the  pace  of  economic  growth  in \ndeveloping countries has declined significantly, and has in some cases \nbecome  negative.  The  latest  International  Monetary  Fund  (IMF) \nprojections suggest that economic growth in developed countries this \nyear will contract by 3.8%. The volume of world trade is expected to fall \nby 12.2% and foreign direct investment (FDI) is estimated to fall by \nabout 30% from 2008 levels. Viet Nam has been severely affected by \nthe  global  economic  downturn  because  of  the  country\u2019s  increasing \ndependence on FDI inflows and exports to support its high economic \ngrowth  rate,  since  its  successful  accession  to  the  World  Trade \nOrganization (WTO) in January 2007. FDI disbursement declined by \nabout 18.4% and exports dropped by 10.2% in the first half of 2009. FDI \napproval fell by 75% during the same period. Remittance inflows and \ntourist arrivals also dropped significantly. The global financial crisis has \naffected the Government\u2019s market access for budget financing. As a \nresult, the Government has issued only a limited amount of domestic \nbonds  since  early  2009,  as  bond  yields  in  the  market  remain \nsignificantly higher than the ceilings set by the Government.  \n \nThe  Government  is  concerned  about  the  potential  adverse  poverty \nimpacts  of  significantly  slower  economic  growth.  Because  of  the \ncountry\u2019s young demographic profile, about 1.7 million young workers \nenter the country\u2019s labor force annually. During 2006\u20132007, with annual \naverage gross domestic product (GDP) growth of 7.6%, only about \n800,000 jobs were created annually. With growth projected to decline to \n5%  or  less,  unemployment  and  underemployment  could  increase \nsignificantly. At the same time, the social security system is still in a \nvery early stage of its development. The Government\u2019s cash transfer \nprogram  has  limited  coverage,  and  is  fraught  with  implementation \n ", " ii \n \nproblems. Therefore, preventing a collapse of economic activities and \nsustaining employment are high priorities. \n \nThe Government has announced a significant fiscal stimulus package \nto  counter  the  potential  adverse  impacts  of  the  global  economic \ndownturn. The fiscal stimulus package is intended to bolster the primary \nstrengths of the economy, maintain GDP growth above 5%, and ensure \nsocial stability. It broadly consists of four pillars: (i) enhancing state \ninvestment  funded  from  the  budget  and  additional  bond  issues; \n(ii) exemptions,  reductions,  and  deferments  in  taxes,  intended  to \nsupport  business  and  bolster  domestic  consumption;  (iii) interest \nsubsidies and credit guarantees intended to keep credit flowing; and \n(iv) additional budget expenditure for social welfare. \n \nIt is in the context of the second-round effects on the real economy and \nthe emerging fiscal constraint that the Government has requested ADB \nto  provide  a  CSF  of  $500 million  to  support  its  public  expenditure \nprogram  for  2009.  The  request  for  financing  stemmed  from  the \nGovernment\u2019s  concerns  about  ensuring  predictability  in  its  budget \nfinancing  since  (i)  market  financing  access  on  reasonable  terms  is \nexpected to be limited, and (ii) a larger fiscal stimulus is now needed.  \nObjective, Scope,  The  objective  of  the  VIE-CS  loan  is  to  provide  support  for  the \nand Coverage of  Government\u2019s countercyclical spending program for 2009 and therefore \nLoan  ensure predictability in its budget financing given limited market access \nand  the  need  for  a  temporary  fiscal  expansion.  This  will  allow  the \nGovernment to promote economic recovery, protect its social spending \nand poverty alleviation programs and objectives, and continue with its \nlonger term development objectives in 2009.   \nFinancing Plan  The Government has requested a loan of $500,000,000 under the CSF \nfrom ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, with interest to be determined in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based \nlending facility plus 200 basis points; a 5-year term, including a grace \nperiod  of  3  years;  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  as  are \nsubstantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  draft  Loan \nAgreement. \n \nPeriod and  The period specified for the VIE-CS will be from 1 September 2009 to \nTranching  31 December 2010, with a single tranche loan of $500 million to be \ndisbursed  when  the  Government  has  met  the  conditions  for  loan \neffectiveness. \n   \nCounterpart Funds  The  Government  will  use  the  local  currency  counterpart  funds \ngenerated  by  the  loan  proceeds  to  help  maintain  current  social \nexpenditure and infrastructure spending. \n   \nExecuting Agency   State Bank of Viet Nam (SBV) \n   \n ", "  iii \nImplementation  SBV will be the Executing Agency responsible for overall execution and \nArrangements  coordination  of  the  Government's  countercyclical  program  and  for \nreporting to ADB.  The Government will establish a committee, chaired \nby MPI, comprising officials from SBV, MOF, and other line ministries. \nThe committee will be responsible for monitoring and overseeing the \nimplementation  of  the  Government's  countercyclical  programs \nsupported under the CSF loan. The committee will meet quarterly to \nreport  on  progress  of  implementation  of  the  Government's \ncountercyclical programs supported under the loan. The committee will \nalso  report  on  overall  progress  of  the  Government's  countercyclical \npublic spending program. ADB may be invited to participate in some of \nthe meetings as an observer.  At the implementation level, SBV and \nMOF will be responsible for administering the disbursement of loan \nproceeds  from  ADB  and  maintaining  accounts.  MPI  will  select  and \nsubmit the proposals for activities to be supported under the CSF loan. \nThe line ministries will assist SBV in monitoring activities carried out by \ntheir ministries. \n   \nProcurement and  The loan proceeds will be used to finance the full foreign exchange \nDisbursement  costs (excluding local duties and taxes) of items produced and procured \nin  ADB  member  countries,  excluding  ineligible  items  and  imports \nfinanced by other bilateral and multilateral sources. The loan proceeds \nwill be disbursed to the Borrower in accordance with the provisions of \nADB\u2019s  Simplification  of  Disbursement  Procedures  and  Related \nRequirements for Program Loans. \n   \nBenefits and  The VIE-CS will provide significant benefits and have a positive impact \nBeneficiaries  on the economy and poor because of the following:  \n \n(i)  Higher infrastructure spending will generate long-term growth, \nstimulate investment, create jobs, and raise incomes. \n(ii)  Improved  social  sector  outcomes  will  result  from  increased \nspending;  better  targeted  social  assistance  programs; \nimplementation of the Government\u2019s social welfare efforts, in \nparticular  on  61  districts  identified  as  being  the  poorest  in \nViet Nam  and  assistance  provided  to  affected  eligible \nenterprises to reduce the unemployment impact of the crisis. \n(iii)  The VIE-CS will help close the budget financing gap within a \nmedium-term  fiscal  program,  thereby  supporting  economic \ngrowth and macroeconomic stability. \n   \nRisks and  The VIE-CS supplements financing from other ADB programs such as \nAssumptions  the  proposed  second  subprogram  of  the  fifth  Support  for  the \nImplementation of the Poverty Reduction Program (SIPRP V), scheduled \nfor consideration by ADB\u2019s Board of Directors in October 2009. The \nSIPRP  supports  the  Government\u2019s  policy  reform  efforts,  which  are \nneeded  for  the  successful  implementation  of  its  Five-Year  Socio-\nEconomic Development Plan (SEDP), 2006\u20132010, including in the areas \nof  public  financial  management  and  pubic  administration,  tax \nadministration  reform,  investment  competitiveness,  natural  resource \nmanagement, and social protection. \n ", " iv \n \n \nHowever, the VIE-CS has risks:  \n \n(i)  The  global  financial  crisis  has  adversely  affected  Viet  Nam\u2019s \neconomy. A prolonged global recession will reduce economic \ngrowth further and will feed into higher poverty in 2009 and \n2010. However, these effects on poverty will be partially offset \nthrough  the  Government\u2019s  large  fiscal  stimulus  to  support \ninfrastructure  development  and  other  social  assistance \nprograms. \n(ii)  The absorptive capacity of concerned implementing ministries \nand agencies will be stretched and may affect the timeliness and \neffectiveness  of  the  Government\u2019s  countercyclical  spending \nprogram.  The  Government  has  introduced  several  policy \nmeasures to expedite disbursements and this will mitigate some \nof these potential constraints. \n(iii)  Program  leakages  and  corruption.  Some  social  assistance \nprograms, interest subsidy, and infrastructure are vulnerable to \nleakages,  mis-targeting,  and  corruption.  The  Government  is \ncommitted to addressing these problems though a number of \ninstruments,  including  improved  supervision,  enhanced \nmonitoring,  and  continued  reforms  in  public  financial \nmanagement and procurement\u2014supported by the World Bank \nand other development partners. \n ", "     \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for Countercyclical Support (VIE-CS). The development \npolicy  letter  confirming  the  Government\u2019s  countercyclical  program  and  its  medium-term \ndevelopment program is in Appendix 1. The status of the Government\u2019s compliance with the \naccess criteria is in Appendix 2.1 \n \nII.  REQUEST FOR ASSISTANCE FROM                                                                \nTHE COUNTERCYCLICAL SUPPORT FACILITY \n2.  The  proposed  loan  under  the  Countercyclical  Support  Facility  (CSF)  of  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) comes at a critical time for Viet Nam. It is designed to maintain the \nmomentum of the country\u2019s key development efforts at a challenging time of global financial \nmarket  failure  and  the  first  global  recession  since  World  War II.  The  global  crisis,  which \nintensified after September 2008, has affected the Viet Nam economy and social sectors in \nseveral respects: (i) the surge in commodity prices early in 2008 and the subsequent first-round \neffects of the global financial crisis impacted on its domestic financial sector and increased \ndownside risks to its external balance in 2008; (ii) the second-round effects of reduced global \ndemand have hurt the real economy by stalling its two engines of growth\u2014external trade and \nforeign direct investment (FDI)\u2014with economic growth in 2009 slowing to rates last seen in \n1999; (iii) the impact on fiscal policy has resulted in a decline in tax revenue and a larger \ngovernment budget deficit than initially projected, at a time of limited access to international \ncredit markets; and (iv) the economic and fiscal policy impacts threaten to undo recent gains in \npoverty reduction. \n3.  Given the second-round effects on the real economy and the emerging fiscal constraint, \nthe Government of Viet Nam asked ADB to provide a countercyclical support loan (VIE-CS) of \n$500 million to support its 2009 and 2010 public expenditure programs. The Government is \nconcerned about maintaining economic growth above 5% and protecting jobs and stability. It is \nalso concerned about ensuring predictability in its budget financing, given the necessity for \ntemporary fiscal stimulus. The Government projects gross financing requirements for 2009 at \nD203.5 trillion, including domestic and external debt that matures in 2009. Therefore, the loan \nwill provide additional financing to the Government for the larger fiscal stimulus now needed.  \n4.  Adverse effects of the global financial crisis. The economy has been adversely \nimpacted by the global economic crisis. This impact is manifested in several ways. Economic \ngrowth is projected at 3%\u20135% in 2009, down from an average of 7.6% for the last 4 years. The \nslump in FDI, exports, and remittances are the key factors behind this sharper than expected \neconomic slowdown. Viet Nam is also experiencing temporary fiscal constraint because of the \nslowdown. The 2009 budget plan projects government revenue to decline by about 3.0% of \ngross domestic product (GDP) below 2008 levels, primarily because of the slump in resource \ntax revenues. Actual revenue collection in the first half of 2009 was about 5.1% below the target \nspecified in the 2009 budget plan. The 2009 overall government budget deficit could rise to \n10.3% of GDP, including the stimulus spending package, up from 4.1% of GDP in 2008, which \nis relatively high by international standards. However, ADB staff estimate that the cyclically \nadjusted (or underlying) budget deficit is about 4.5% of GDP. \n  \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2009. Enhancing ADB\u2019s Response to the Global Economic Crisis\u2014Establishing the Countercyclical Support \nFacility. Manila.  \n ", "2   \n5.  Improved macroeconomic management. The Government has made strong efforts to \nmaintain macroeconomic management of the increased downside risks to the economy arising \nfrom (i) its own economic overheating in 2007 and the surge in global commodity prices in early \n2008, and (ii) the global financial crisis that intensified in September 2008. The maintenance of \nmacroeconomic stability is reflected in inflation declining from its peak of 28% in August 2008 to \n2.0%  in  August  2009  on  a  year-on-year  basis.  Overall,  the  banking  sector  is  sufficiently \ncapitalized. While banks\u2019 nonperforming loans (NPLs)2 have risen slightly, they remained low at \n2.2% for the whole banking system in June 2009. The Government has operated overall budget \ndeficits (combined on- and off-budget balances) averaging 4% of GDP in the last 4 years, \nprimarily driven by large capital spending accounting for about 30% of on-budget spending. Viet \nNam remains at low risk of external debt distress despite the recent deterioration in its economic \nconditions and the global downturn, reflecting Viet Nam\u2019s mostly concessional and long-term \nstructure of external debt. The outlook for public debt is less favorable. While it has been \nrelatively  stable,  at  44.4%  of  GDP,  it  is  moderately  high  for  a  developing  economy  and \nunderscores the need for medium-term fiscal consolidation (Appendix 5). However, its external \nposition remains vulnerable to modest shocks. Gross international reserves declined from $23.0 \nbillion at the end of December 2008 to $17.6 billion at the end of June 2009, equivalent to about \n3.7 months  of  import  cover.  Conventionally,  at  least  3.0  months  of  import  coverage  is \nconsidered a sufficient buffer against modest shocks to the balance of payments. At the same \ntime, Viet Nam has a relatively high level of reserves in relation to short term debt. \n \n6.  Large fiscal response. The Government has announced a countercyclical program to \nmitigate  the  potential  severe  impacts  of  the  global  slowdown  on  Viet  Nam.  The  program \nincludes both on- and off-budget measures and focuses on increased infrastructure spending, \ntemporary tax exemptions, and deferred tax payments intended to support business and bolster \ndomestic consumption; interest rate subsidies and credit guarantees intended to keep credit \nflowing; and additional budget expenditure for social welfare. The entire stimulus package is \nestimated to amount to D145.6 trillion. The Government intends to use the loan proceeds from \nthe VIE-CS loan to support its countercyclical spending program for 2009 and 2010, and in \nparticular  its  longer  term  infrastructure  development  in  irrigation,  transportation,  and  other \nareas.3 \n7.  Fiscal space. In the context of its debt burden, the fiscal stimulus package is expected \nnot to adversely affect debt sustainability provided that measures undertaken are time bound \nand do not have a permanent impact on deficits. A cross-country comparison drawing on IMF \npublications indicates that the debt stabilizing primary deficit is within manageable bounds in \nViet Nam.4 Appendix 10 provides details of fiscal stimulus packages in a number of countries. \n \n8.  Donor  coordination.  The  VIE-CS  loan  supplements  ADB  policy  dialogue  with  the \nGovernment under existing loan programs to Viet Nam and especially under the Support for the \nImplementation of the Poverty Reduction Program (SIPRP) cluster approved by ADB\u2019s Board of \nDirectors in December 2008 (Appendix 9). The SIPRP is a series of three annual, single-tranche \nloans  (subprograms)  supporting  the  policy  reform  agenda  of  the  Government  needed  for \nsuccessful  implementation  of  its  medium-term  Socio-Economic  Development  Plan  (SEDP), \n2006\u20132010. The SIPRP provides parallel financing with the World Bank\u2019s Poverty Reduction \n                                                 \n2  Based on Viet Nam's definition of NPLs. \n3  Prime Minister Circular 4585/VPCP-QHQt dated 6 July 2009 assigns SBV to take the lead in the effort to obtain the \ncountercyclical support loan from ADB. MPI will collaborate with MOF and other relevant line ministries to develop \nproposals for the use of the loan proceeds, focusing on areas including transportation and irrigation.  \n4  International Monetary Fund. 2009.

Under subprogram 1 of the SIPRP, the Government implemented a series of measures \nto  promote  continuing  equitization  of  state-owned  enterprises,  start  rationalizing  fiscal \ninvestment  incentives  and  electricity  reforms,  and  other  business  climate  measures. \nSubprogram 2, scheduled to be submitted to the Board for consideration in October 2009, builds \non reforms initiated under subprogram 1 for the state enterprise sector and the electricity sector. \nIt also includes measures that will strengthen the Government\u2019s macroeconomic framework \nsuch as drafting a law on the central bank enhancing its autonomy, formulating a public debt \nmanagement law, governance in recruitment and promotion of civil servants, and development \nof  an  anticorruption  strategy.  In  the  social  sector,  the  focus  is  on  developing  a  long-term \neducation development strategy. Appendix 6 contains the development partners coordination \nmatrix.   \n \nIII.  THE GLOBAL CRISIS AND COUNTRY CONTEXT \nA.  The Global Crisis and its Impact on Viet Nam\u2019s Economy \n10.  The global financial turmoil has affected developed and most developing economies, \nincluding Viet Nam. The impact on developing countries has varied, but generally the crisis \nadversely impacted access to global financial markets; and resulted in a sharp downturn in the \nreal  economy  with  ensuing  fiscal  stress,  and  higher  unemployment  and  poverty.  The \nInternational Monetary Fund projects that the global economy will contract this year by about \n3.8% and only moderately recover next year, as financial market stabilization will take longer \nthan previously envisaged. The volume of world trade is expected to fall by 12.2% and FDI is \nestimated to fall by about 30% from 2008 levels. Developing country access to international \ncredit will remain curtailed as a consequence. \n \n11.  Four  key  features  of  Viet  Nam\u2019s  recent  economic  developments  are  important  in \nunderstanding the potential effects of the global economic downturn and the Government\u2019s \ndetermined  policy  response  to  cope  with  the  impacts.  First,  the  country  is  increasingly \ndependent on FDI inflows and exports to support its high economic growth rate, particularly \nsince its successful accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO) in January 2007. Before \nWTO accession, investment in Viet Nam was dominated by state investment. In 2007, FDI \ndisbursement surged by over 90% and continued to expand strongly in 2008 to reach D192.4 \ntrillion. As a result, the share of FDI in the country\u2019s total investment increased to 31.5% in 2008, \nfrom 16.2% in 2006. At the same time, Viet Nam traditionally has a very high degree of \nopenness to trade, with a trade\u2013GDP ratio of 159% in 2008. Given its high trade intensity, it is \ntherefore highly vulnerable to shocks to global demand. Second, Viet Nam entered the global \neconomic downturn from a position of domestic economic overheating in late 2007 and early \n2008, necessitating a sharp reorientation in economic policy measures. Third, unlike more \ndeveloped economies in the region, Viet Nam does not have all the same policy levers and \nappropriate institutions to address the series of shocks to the economy effectively, and at times \nhad to adopt blunt and unconventional measures such as credit subsidies to mitigate the worst \neffects of the crisis on the macroeconomy and labor market. The Government is well aware of \nthe need for more market-based instruments, and is addressing these policy and institutional \nconstraints through ongoing reforms including those supported by the SIPRP and the World \nBank\u2019s PRSC series. Finally, Viet Nam has a young demographic profile, and its social security \n ", "4   \nsystem is still in a very early stage of development. Therefore, the global financial crisis has \nmajor adverse short-term implications for Viet Nam\u2019s labor market and poverty reduction efforts. \n \n12.  The global commodity price surge. Viet Nam has experienced three major shocks to \nits economy in the past 18 months. The first was the surge in global commodity prices that \nspilled over into very high domestic inflation, peaking at 28% in August 2008 on a year-on-year \nbasis. This occurred at a time when Viet Nam\u2019s economy exhibited significant signs of economic \noverheating caused by rapid credit and monetary growth, fueled by large inflows of foreign \ninvestments. Consequently, the domestic financial and asset markets underwent significant \ncorrection in the first half of 2008. The equity market was impacted, with equity prices collapsing \nby more than two-thirds in 2008. Property prices also fell in the major urban centers. There was \nsome capital flight (of which some was disguised through imports of gold) that put pressure on \nthe dong exchange rate to depreciate in the first semester of 2008. \n \n13.  First-round effects of the global financial crisis. The global financial crisis intensified \nin September 2008. However, the spillovers from the global financial crisis on the Viet Nam \ndomestic  financial  sector\u2014especially  banking\u2014have  been  less  significant  than  in  other \ncountries in the region because of limited exposure to troubled US assets, virtually no exposure \nto securitization and off-balance-sheet activities, and of course domestic financial and asset \nmarkets had already experienced significant correction. The financial health of the domestic \nbanking  system  has  improved  in  recent  years.  Overall,  the  banking  system  is  adequately \ncapitalized but it remains vulnerable to the economic slowdown, given the rapid credit growth \nseen in the last 2 years. The Government\u2019s international reserves position declined from $23.0 \nbillion at the end of 2008 to $17.6 billion at the end of June 2009\u2014highlighting continued \npressure on its external position.  \n \n14.  The global credit crunch that emerged in September 2008 hurt Viet Nam as investors \nbecame risk averse and reduced demand for Viet Nam debt. Yields on the Government\u2019s global \nbond surged significantly, in line with many countries in the region (Figure 1.c). While the yields \nhave gradually declined, they remain elevated. As a result, so far this year the Government has \nonly issued a small amount of dong-denominated bonds and dollar-denominated bonds in the \ndomestic market. The Government has not issued any sovereign bond overseas since 2005. \n \n15.  Second-round effects of the global demand destruction. The second-round effects \nof the global recession on the Viet Nam economy are greater than the impacts of the 1997/1998 \nAsian financial crisis. Total exports fell 10.2% in the first semester of 2009. Traditional labor-\nintensive sectors experienced larger contractions, with exports of light industrial and handicrafts \nfalling by 25%. The tourism sector also suffered significantly, with tourist arrivals falling 20% in \nthe first half of 2009. Disbursements of FDI declined by 18.4% in the first semester of 2009. As \na result, the Viet Nam economy slowed to 3.9% in the first 6 months of 2009 over the same \nperiod  in  2008,  its  lowest  economic  growth  rate  since  1999,  and  well  below  its  average \neconomic growth rate of 7.6% in the last 4 years. Of significant concern for poverty reduction, \nthe inflows of remittances have dropped sharply by 26% in the first half of 2009, down to $2.7 \nbillion from $3.7 billion for the same period in 2008. \n \n16.  With this background, it is expected that economic growth for 2009 will be about 3.0%\u2013\n5.0% because of faltering exports, slowing foreign investments, and the drop in remittances. \nThese projections translate to lower per capita income growth of 1.5%\u20133.5% in 2009, thereby \nlikely increasing poverty (para. 17).  \n ", "                           5\n    \nTable 1: Viet Nam Country Economic Indicators \n \nItem  2004  2005  2006  2007  2008  2009 \nA.

Poverty alleviation and employment. The potential impact of the global economic \nslowdown on employment is expected to be significant. With economic growth projected to \ndecline to 3.0%\u22125.0%, empirical evidence suggests that the Viet Nam economy may only be \n ", "6   \nable to create 300,000\u2013700,000 additional jobs each year during 2009\u20132010, a significant \ndecrease from 800,000 jobs created during 2006\u20132007.5 At the same time, the majority of the \npopulation is aged below 20 years old and about 1.7 million young workers enter the country\u2019s \nlabor force annually. As a result, it is expected that new job entrants will outnumber new jobs \ncreated by more than 2 to 1\u2014putting significant pressure on the labor market, earnings, and poverty. \nThe Government is concerned that the current global financial crisis will have adverse effects on \nits efforts to reduce poverty if there is a significant reduction in economic growth, retrenchments, \nand shrinking employment opportunities. While timely employment data are not available, data \nfrom the Ministry of Labor, Invalids, and Social Affairs (MOLISA) suggest that 1,260 enterprises \nreported job cuts of about 65,000 workers in the first few months of 2009. As expected, job cuts \nare mainly from export-oriented industries such as textiles and garments, leather and footwear, \nhandicrafts, seafood processing, and agriculture processing. Critical economic zones such as \nHo Chi Minh City, Ha Noi, Binh Duong, and Dong Nai are among the worse affected. Looking at \nthe  gender  composition,  although  the  garment  and  footwear  industries  employ  a  larger \nproportion of women workers, only about 21,600 (33%) of reported job losses affected women. \n \n  Figure 1:  Impacts of Global Financial Crisis in Viet Nam \n   \n           (a) Investment (D trillion)  (b) Exports ($ billion) \n \n \n  300 70\n   \n250 60\n   \n200 50\n \n   \n  150 40\n    100 30\n    50 20\n \n  0 10\n \n2005 2006 2007 2008 6M2009\n    0\n    State Non-State FDI 2005 2006 2007 2008 6M2009\n  \n \n(c) US Dollar 5-Year Bond Yields (%)         (d) Remittances ($ billion) \n   \n       25 7\n \n  6\n  20\n    5\n15\n    4\n    10 3\n \n    5 2\n    1\n0\n \n      03/19/2007 07/19/2007 11/19/2007 03/19/2008 07/19/2008 11/19/2008 03/19/2009 07/19/2009 0 2005 2006 2007 2008 6M2009\n   \nFDI = foreign direct investment. \n \nSources: Ministry of Finance, General Statistics Office, and CIEC Data Company Ltd. \n \n \n18.  The global financial crisis and economic downturn have affected the Government\u2019s fiscal \nposition in three ways.

Second, the fall in oil \nprices and a slowing economy are projected to reduce budget revenues by about 3.0% of GDP \nin 2009 over 2008 levels. Actual revenue collected in the first half of 2009 was about 5.1% \nbelow the target specified in the 2009 budget plan, partly because of temporary tax exemptions \nprovided as part of the fiscal stimulus (Figure 2). As a result of increased off-budget spending \nand a projected decline in budget revenues, the 2009 overall budget deficit is now projected to \nwiden from 4.1% in 2008 to 10.3% of GDP.6 Whether it reaches 10.3% will partially depend on \nimplementation and timing of the different fiscal stimulus measures and revenue outcomes \n(para. 24). Finally, elevated risks in the financial market have increased the cost of financing \ninfrastructure spending in the budget. \n \n  Figure 2:  Tax Revenues over the Economic Cycle \n  (year-on-year growth in %) \n   \n   \n75.0\n   \n    60.0\n   \n    45.0\n   \n30.0\n   \n    15.0\n   \n    0.0\n   \n-15.0\n   \n    Mar- Jun- Sep- Dec- Mar- Jun- Sep- Dec- Mar- Jun- Sep- Dec- Mar- Jun-\n    06 06 06 06 07 07 07 07 08 08 08 08 09 09\n   \nGDP Tax and Fees\n   \n  GDP = gross domestic product. \n  Notes: Nominal GDP growth year-on-year and budget tax revenue and fees year-on-year. \nSource:CEICDataCompanyLtd.\n \n \nB.  The Government\u2019s Macroeconomic Management \n19.  Appropriate and responsive policy. The Government\u2019s macroeconomic policy stance \nto the increased downside risks to the economy from the global crisis has been appropriate and \nresponsive,  although  its  available  policy  levers  and  institutional  framework  to  address  the \nshocks have been limited compared to regional peers. On the monetary side, the State Bank of \nVietnam  (the  central  bank)  has  broadly  operated  an  appropriate  monetary  policy  stance \nthroughout  the  crisis.  In  early  2008,  it  tightened  monetary  policy  (including  introducing \ncompulsory sale of bills) to counter the threat of second-round inflationary pressures and to cool \nthe economy. It then shifted to a more accommodative stance at the end of 2008 to promote \ngrowth against the backdrop of falling commodity prices and inflation. Inflation fell from a peak \nof 28% in August 2008 to 2.0% in August 2009. Although inflation has declined rapidly, some \npressure on the dong to depreciate remains. As shown in Figure 3, the black market exchange \nrate was above the daily upper band by about 3%\u20134% in early July 2009 and appreciated \n                                                 \n6  The overall fiscal balance includes off-budget investment expenditure and net lending from official development \nassistance-financed projects and Vietnam Development Bank net lending activities.    \n ", "8   \nslightly in August. This may be attributed in large part to domestic inflationary expectations, \nwhich need to be managed carefully going forward. The Government recognizes this risk and \nwill remain vigilant to the return of inflationary pressure. SBV has announced a target for credit \ngrowth of 30% for 2009. The capital base in the banking system remains adequate. While \nbanks\u2019 NPLs have risen slightly, they remained low at 2.2% for the whole banking system in \nJune 2009 (Figure 3).7 \n \nFigure 3: Banking Sector Soundness Indicators, Inflation, and Exchange Rate \n \n(a) Capital Adequacy Ratio               (b) Nonperforming Loan (%)   \n  \n  35 3\n  30 2.5\n25\n  2\n20\n  15 1.5\n  10 1\n  5 0.5\n0 0\n \nSOCBs JSBs JVB-FBs 2007 2008 May-09\n \nDec-08 May-09 SOCBs JSBs JVB-FBs\n \n (c) Year-on-Year Inflation (%)                        (d) Exchange Rate Upper Band Limit and Unofficial Rate \n \n30.0 19,000\n \n  25.0 18,500\n18,000\n  20.0\n17,500\n \n15.0 17,000\n \n  10.0 16,500\n16,000\n  5.0\n  15,500\n   0J.a0n-08 Mar-08 May-08 Jul-08 Sep-08 Nov-08 Jan-09 Mar-09 May-09 15,03010-Oct-07 31-Mar-08 31-Aug-08 31-Jan-09 30-Jun-09\nUpper trading band limit Black market exchange rate\n \nSources: General Statistical Office and State Bank of Viet Nam. \n \n \n20.  On the external side, earlier concerns about external risks to the balance of payments \narising from the large current account deficit and overheating economy did not materialize. The \ncurrent  account  has  undertaken  a  substantial  cyclical  correction.  Trade  deficit  declined  to \n$2.1 billion in the first semester of 2009 from $11.4 billion during the same period in 2008. \nHowever,  the  external  balance  remains  vulnerable  to  modest  shocks.  The  Government\u2019s \ninternational reserves position declined by about $5.5 billion since December 2008 to $17.6 \nbillion in June 2009, in part due to increasing capital outflows in the first quarter of 2009. The \npace of capital outflows declined significantly in the second quarter. The external vulnerability \nrisks are partly mitigated by declining inflationary expectation as shown by slight appreciation in \nthe dong in August 2009. The Government\u2019s international reserves is sufficient to cover about \n3.7 months of imports and short-term debt is relatively low at about 10% of gross international \nreserves.  \n \n21.  The Government\u2019s response to mitigating the risk of the global financial crisis involves a \nnumber  of  proactive  measures  aimed  at  increasing  liquidity  in  the  banking  system, \nstrengthening the capital base of the banking system, and strengthening SBV\u2019s supervisory \n                                                 \n7  Based on Viet Nam's definition of nonperforming loan. \n ", "                           9\n    \nefforts. First, SBV increased liquidity in the banking system by easing monetary policy including \nreducing its base interest rate, lowering its reserve requirements, and allowing for an advanced \npayment of SBV bills that the commercial banks were required to purchase in March 2008 as \npart of its earlier bid to address economic overheating. Second, SBV moved toward a more \nflexible exchange rate by widening the exchange rate trading band to +/\u20135% by March 2009 to \nallow exchange rate adjustment to help absorb some of the external shock felt by exporters. \nThird,  SBV  upgraded  its  supervision  efforts  considerably,  and  raised  the  minimum  capital \nrequirement for commercial banks. With these measures, indicators show signs of improvement.   \n \n22.  Public finances. With the destruction in global demand since September 2008, and the \nrecognition by the Government and development partners that a fiscal expansion is necessary, \nthe Government announced a fiscal stimulus package in early 2009. ADB staff estimate that an \noverall budget deficit could reach 10.3% of GDP (Table 2).This budget deficit represents an \nincrease of up to 6.2% of GDP from 2008 levels, which is high relative to regional standards.8 \nHowever, a large part of the increase in the deficit in the budget plan is due to conservative \nrevenue projections, which reduces revenues by 3.0% of GDP from 2008 levels, attributable to \nan  expected  lower  price  for  fuel  and  its  knock-on  effect  for  crude  oil  royalty  payments. \nNevertheless, whether the overall deficit reaches 10.3% of GDP will depend on implementation \nand timing of the different fiscal stimulus measures and actual budget revenue outcomes for \n2009. Some of the planned capital spending measures are dependent on financing through \nGovernment Treasury bonds and thus may be delayed.9 Therefore, the actual stimulus impact \nof the expansion will be less than 3.2% of GDP (netting out projected revenue declines). A \nrecent  International  Monetary  Fund  (IMF)  study  suggests  that  the  magnitude  of  the  fiscal \nexpansion, discretionary and nondiscretionary components, should depend on the size of the \noutput gap.10 Overall, the actual fiscal stimulus in Viet Nam covers the projected negative output \ngap this year (i.e., the gap between potential and actual economic growth), suggesting that the \nsize of the fiscal expansion is sufficient (Appendix 3).  \n \n23.  ADB staff estimates indicate that the cyclically adjusted budget overall deficit for 2009 is \nabout 4.5% of GDP after making adjustments for the temporary stimulus measures, such as \ntemporary tax exemptions and deferral, infrastructure spending to be carried over from 2008, \ninfrastructure spending to be brought forward from 2010, and interest rate subsidy (Table 3). \nAlthough the cyclically adjusted deficit is close to the historical average, its large size suggests \nthat  room  for  further  fiscal  expansion  is  limited  over  the  medium  term.  The  Government \nrecognizes  the  necessity  for  fiscal  consolidation  over  the  medium  term  and  to  reduce  its \ndependency on oil-related revenues going forward, primarily by expanding the tax base. The \nimplementation of Tax System Reform and Modernization for 2005\u20132010 has produced good \nresults, which have set a base for more progress and modernization in the coming years. The \nGovernment  has  made  significant  progress  in  improving  tax  administration,  following  the \npassage of a Tax Administration Law in 2007. The National Assembly passed a new corporate \nIncome tax law and personal income tax law in 2008. The two laws have been effective since \nJanuary 2009. Together with implementing the new tax laws, the Ministry of Finance (MOF) also \naims to improve tax administration further, and thereby increase the number of registered \n                                                 \n8  ADB staff estimates of fiscal expansion in Southeast Asia: Cambodia, 1.8% of GDP; Indonesia, 2.4%; Philippines, \n2.3%; and Thailand, 5.1%. \n9  Given the Government\u2019s conservative approach in obtaining budget financing, it is likely that implementation of part \nof the infrastructure spending in the fiscal stimulus could be delayed.

Public  debt  sustainability.  Despite  a  significant  increase  in  budget  deficit,  the \nGovernment\u2019s debt position is projected to be sustainable. The Government\u2019s public debt at the \nend of 2008 was at 44.4% of GDP, 56% of which is external debt. The recent International \nMonetary Fund Article IV Consultation11 concludes that Viet Nam\u2019s debt position is at low risk of \ndistress. Most debt is concessional, with a low fixed interest rate and well spread out maturities. \nUnder the baseline scenario, the present value of public debt in relation to GDP is projected to \nincrease from 37% of GDP in 2008 to 46% in 2013, and decline thereafter to 43% in 2028. \nStress tests of a one-time 30% depreciation in the dong would increase the present value of \npublic debt by 7%, and an increase in debt-creating flows by 10 percentage points of GDP \nwould increase the present value of public debt by 8% in 2013. However, these two risks are \nless likely to materialize now. The trade balance position has improved significantly relative to \nlast year. Although fiscal stimulus will increase the budget deficit in 2009, a large part of it will be \nfinanced by government deposits (non-debt creating flows). In addition, the fiscal stimulus \ninvolves advancing project implementation from 2010, which is expected to reduce the budget \ndeficit and debt financing in 2010. Based on IMF projections, Viet Nam requires a primary \nbudget deficit of about 3.3% of GDP to stabilize its debt over the medium term. Therefore, Viet \nNam has sufficient fiscal space as its debt is mostly concessional. \n \nIV.  THE GOVERNMENT\u2019S COUNTERCYCLICAL PROGRAM \n  \n25.  The Government announced its countercyclical expenditure program earlier this year \nand the National Assembly endorsed it in June 2009. Like many other developing economies, \nthe  national  government  budget  does  not  have  automatic  stabilizers  embedded  on  the \nexpenditure side of the budget and its social security system is still in too early a stage of \ndevelopment to be an adequate stabilizer (Appendix 10).12 Therefore, it had to announce the \ncountercyclical  program,  focusing  on  advancing  infrastructure  projects  already  in  the \nGovernment\u2019s  investment  pipeline,  tax  cuts  and  deferred  payments  intended  to  support \nbusiness  and  bolster  domestic  consumption,  interest  rate  subsidies  and  credit  guarantees \nintended  to  keep  credit  flowing,  and  additional  budget  expenditure  for  social  welfare.  The \ncountercyclical  program  is  designed  to  stimulate  the  economy,  with  particular  focus  on \nprotecting employment and social stability. Given that Viet Nam\u2019s social security system is in its \ninfancy, the Government feels it needs to use blunt and some unconventional instruments, such \nas credit subsidies, to protect employment and assist the poor and vulnerable groups in the \ncommunity. Much of this additional stimulus is discretionary and temporary in nature, and \ntherefore does not undermine the Government\u2019s efforts for medium-term fiscal consolidation. \nOverall, the stimulus package amounts to D145.6 trillion of on- and off-budget programs (Table \n3). \n \n26.  Infrastructure. Additional spending on infrastructure in 2009 is projected at D90.8 trillion \n(62%  of  the  stimulus  package),  achieved  mainly  through  carrying  over  savings  from  the \ninfrastructure program in the 2008 budget and advancing to 2009 priority projects from the 2010 \ninvestment pipeline (Table 3).13 Under current public financial regulations, line agencies are only \n                                                 \n11International  Monetary  Fund.  2009.  Vietnam;  2008  Article  IV  Consultation\u2500Staff  Report;  Staff  Supplement \nStatement; Public Information Notice on the Executive Board Discussion; and Statement by the Executive Director \nfor Vietnam.  IMF Country Report No. 09/110. Washington, DC. (April). \n12 International experience suggests that the mix of the fiscal stimulus package depends on the country\u2019s fiscal \ncharacteristics. Countries in which the automatic stabilizers are larger will need a smaller discretionary stimulus. \nFiscal expansion should be larger in a particular country if multipliers are lower. However, fiscal space will limit the \nsize of fiscal stimulus in some countries. \n13 Infrastructure components of the fiscal stimulus package are mostly off-budget items. However, all of them require \napproval of the National Assembly just like other on-budget items of the budget. \n ", "12  \nable to disburse funds on projects up to 1 month after the fiscal year ends. In response to the \ncrisis,  the  Government  extended  this  deadline  to  June  2009.  The  2010  advanced  priority \nprojects cover transportation, rural irrigation, canal upgrading, poverty reduction projects in the \n61 poor districts across the country, and social housing construction. Many of these priority \nprojects are quick disbursing, labor-intensive projects to ensure maximum job creation from the \ninfrastructure  projects.  About  D20  trillion  of  these  projects  will  depend  on  issuance  of \ngovernment bonds and these could be delayed given the current high cost of domestic financing.    \n \n27.  Tax measures. Temporary tax exemptions and deferred tax payments for eligible firms \nto the end of 2009 are designed to have had an immediate impact on stimulating household \nconsumption and to provide tax relief to labor-intensive firms to protect employment, while much \nof the infrastructure spending is only expected to have an impact in the second semester of \n2009 because of the longer time involved in the procurement and disbursement process. The \ntax  relief  measures  apply  to  corporate  income  tax  or  CIT  (for  small  and  medium-sized \nenterprises and firms operating in the textile and footwear sectors), personal income tax (PIT), \nand value-added tax (VAT); and amount to D28 trillion. MOF adopted a mix of temporary tax \nexemptions and deferred tax payments to protect its medium-term revenue sustainability efforts \nwhile providing relief to distressed firms and boosting household income. It projects that these \nmeasures will cover up to D13 trillion in tax collection in 2009, of which some proportion will be \ndeferred payments to the end of 2009 and 2010.  \n \n28.  Interest rate subsidies and credit guarantees. The Government introduced a number \nof unconventional measures to provide relief to labor-intensive enterprises, with the objective of \nprotecting employment. These included an interest rate subsidy of 4% on short-term working \ncapital signed and disbursed from February 2009 to December 2009. The same subsidy is \napplied to medium- and long-term investment loans signed and disbursed from April 2009 to \nDecember 2011. The interest rate subsidy is designed to partially offset the increase in the cost \nof domestic financing arising from the global financial crisis and SBV\u2019s earlier policy efforts to \ncool the economy. The subsidized loans are extended by the commercial banks and finance \ncompanies (and reimbursed by SBV) to eligible borrowers on the basis of normal commercial \nprinciples. A new credit guarantee scheme for SMEs\u2019 capital spending, implemented through \nVietnam Development Bank (VDB) was also introduced. The guarantee scheme is aimed at \nenterprises with less than 1,000 employees and capital of less than D20 billion. Under the \nscheme, VDB will assess eligible enterprises and issue a guarantee letter for them to borrow \nfrom commercial banks. SBV has budgeted this subsidy cost at D17 trillion. While interest rate \nsubsidies and guarantees could create problems of their own, the Government considers that \nthis is one of a few instruments it has available to help keep the flow of credit to enterprises \nunder the current situation, and only intends most of it to be a temporary measure. At the same \ntime, SBV has upgraded its monitoring and supervision of the credit subsidy scheme. \n \n29.  Social assistance spending. In the absence of national social assistance programs \nthat could be quickly scaled up and effectively targeted, the Government announced a package \nof assistance to poor families and community groups vulnerable to falling into poverty as a result \nof the economic slowdown. This underscores the necessity for developing better targeted social \nassistance  programs  over  the  medium  term.  The  package  of  assistance  includes  wage \nsubsidies to distressed firms, disaster mitigation programs, and one-off financial assistance and \nhousing support to low-income families as a way to mitigate the worst effects of the crisis on the \nmost vulnerable in the community. The Government will also extend loans from the National \nEmployment Fund to workers laid off for training and self-employment. The Government has \nalso focused its social welfare efforts on 61 districts identified as being the poorest in Viet Nam \nwith poverty incidence close to 50%, more than 3.5 times of the national average. These \n ", "                           13\n    \ndistricts span 20 provinces, primarily in the northwest, northeast, north central, and central \nhighland regions of the country.  \n \n30.  MOF is monitoring implementation and disbursement of key countercyclical spending \nprograms. About 80% of unspent infrastructure spending from the 2008 budget was disbursed \nby May 2009. The tax exemptions and deferred payments impacted immediately. As of June \n2009, D370 trillion in credits were disbursed under the subsidy credit scheme, over 90% of \nwhich was for working capital. The Government recognizes that additional fiscal stimulus could \nalso be generated by expediting the disbursement of project loans that have been approved by \nthe Government. In this context, the Government has taken steps to simplify and streamline \nregulations governing public investment, and to initiate monthly review meetings to monitor and \nimprove official development assistance disbursement. Policy dialogue is also progressing on \nimproving public investment between the Government and the Six Banks Group, comprising \nADB, France Agency for Development (AFD), Japan International Cooperation Agency, Export-\nImport Bank of Korea, Kreditanstalt f\u00fcr Wiederaufbau Entwicklungsbank (KfW), and the World \nBank.  \n \n31.  The effectiveness of the Government\u2019s fiscal stimulus package will depend on better \nbudget execution and targeting. The Government\u2019s public financial management (PFM) reforms \nare at an early stage but steady progress is being made in establishing and improving the \nlegislative  and  institutional  framework.  The  Law  on  Public  Debt  Management  has  been \npromulgated by the National Assembly and will be effective from January 2010. The new law \nwill provide a legal framework for a modern debt management system to monitor public debt, \nanalyzing its profile, and resolving and managing related fiscal risks. Implementation of the 2002 \nState Budget Law is progressing. At the same time, the Government is working on several items \nof key legislation that will significantly enhance public financial management over the medium \nterm. The proposed revision to the Law on State Budget is aimed at (i) introducing a medium-\nterm expenditure framework and performance-based budgeting; (ii) improving budget execution; \n(iii)  enhancing  budget  supervision,  monitoring,  and  implementation;  and  (iv)  increasing \ndecentralization of budget management. A new integrated computerized financial management \nsystem (TABMIS) has been rolled out since 2008 to strengthen expenditure management and \ncontrol. An updated and improved chart of accounts is being developed for implementation in \n2009. A road map for adoption of international public sector accounting standards has been \napproved to provide the basis for preparing the Government\u2019s financial statements to be more in \nline with international practices. The Government is also laying the building blocks for improved \ngovernance and anticorruption measures. Since 2005, implementation of the State Audit Law \nand reporting of the summaries of annual audit reports by the State Audit of Vietnam have \nstrengthened the process of external oversight. Under the World Bank\u2019s PRSC series and \nADB\u2019s  SIPRP,  the  Government  is  working  on  improving  governance  in  recruitment  and \npromotion of civil servants, and development of an anticorruption strategy. The Government \nrecognizes the need to measure progress and impacts of the PFM reforms and has indicated \nthat it will adopt PEFA measurement framework going forward. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "14  \nTable 3: Viet Nam: 2009 Discretionary Fiscal Stimulusa \n(D trillion unless otherwise indicated) \n \n        Potential Direct Impact on \n  Budget b \n            On/Off \n  Announced       Budget in \nItem  Amount  2009  2010  2009 \nA    Revenue  28.0  (28.0)  9.2   \n  1  30% reduction of CIT payments by SMEs for Q4 2008\u2013Q4  13.0  (13.0)  8.6  On-budget \n2009; 30% reduction of CIT payments by large textile and   \nshoe-manufacturing companies for Q4 2008; and 9-month \ndeferral of CIT payments by SMEs and large companies \noperating in certain sectors of the economy  \n  2  Exemption of all personal income from the PIT in the first half  6.5  (6.5)  0.0  On-budget \nof 2009 and exemption of certain types of personal income   \nfrom the PIT in the second half of 2009 \n  3  50% reduction of the VAT on certain goods and services;  8.6  (8.6)  0.6  On-budget \nadvance reimbursement of 90% of VAT payments on inputs \nused in export production; and 180-day deferral of VAT \npayments on certain imports \n             \nB    Expenditure and net lending  117.6  113.5   (24.7)   \n  1  Interest rate subsidies  17.0  16.0  1.0  Off-budget \n  2  one-off additional financial assistance to the poor on the  1.7  1.7  0.0  On-budget \noccasion of the 2009 Tet (lunar new year) holiday  \n  3  Housing support for the poor    3.6  0.5  0.0  On-budget \n  4  Carried over 2008 capital expenditure   30.2  30.2  0.0   \n    a     To be financed with revenue carried over from 2008  22.5  22.5  0.0  On-budget \n    b     To be financed through issuance of treasury bonds  7.7  7.7  0.0  Off-budget \n  5  Expenditure brought forward from 2010 and 2011.

The economic overheating in 2007/2008 and the global financial crisis have provided \nmomentum for accelerating structural reforms to support medium-term growth. The venturing of \nlarge state-owned enterprises (SOEs) into assets markets on a large scale partly fueled the \nasset bubbles of 2007/2008. To address these risks, the Government revised the relevant \nregulations  on  the  financial  management  of  SOEs  to  limit  the  scope  and  nature  of  their \ninvestment activities outside their main business lines. The Government has embarked on \npublic sector reforms. The structure of government was streamlined and reorganized in 2008. \nThe mandate and role of each government agency were redefined and overlapping of functions \neliminated to strengthen their accountability. The new law on civil servants will be effective from \nJanuary 2010, aiming at strengthening the integrity and accountability of public services. The \nGovernment has made strong efforts to simplify administrative procedures through adoption of \nthe one-stop-shop model and recently through the implementation of Project 30. A bold and far-\nreaching master plan issued by the Prime Minister in July 2008 is aimed at cutting red tape and \nensuring consistency, simplicity, and transparency of administrative procedures. In addition, \npredictability and transparency in the law-making process will be significantly improved with \nimplementation of the Law on Promulgation of Legal Normative Documents, effective from 1 \nJanuary  2009.  The  law  requires  that  all  drafts  laws,  ordinances,  and  decrees  undergo  a \ncompulsory regulatory impact assessment before submission to the National Assembly.   \n \nV.  OBJECTIVES, SCOPE, AND COVERAGE OF THE LOAN \n33.  The objective of the CSF loan is to provide support for the Government\u2019s countercyclical \nspending program for 2009 and, therefore, ensure predictability in its budget financing given the \nnecessity for temporary fiscal expansion. This will allow the Government to support economic \ngrowth during a challenging period of weak global growth, protect its social spending and \npoverty alleviation programs and objectives, and continue with its longer term development \nobjectives in 2009. \n34.  The Government has requested a loan of $500,000,000 under the CSF from ADB\u2019s \nordinary capital resources, with interest to be determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London \ninterbank-offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility  plus  200  basis  points;  a  5-year  term, \nincluding a grace period of 3 years; a commitment charge of 75 basis points on the undisbursed \nloan balance; and such other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those \nset forth in the draft loan agreement presented to the Board. The Government has provided \nADB with (i) the reasons for its decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility on \n ", "16  \nthe basis of these terms and conditions, and (ii) an undertaking that these choices were its own \nindependent decision and not made in reliance on any communication or advice from ADB. \n35.  The loan size reflects the budget financing needs of the Government arising from the \nneed to finance the fiscal stimulus package (Table 4). According to ADB staff projections based \non discussion with MOF, the gross budget financing requirements for 2009 are estimated at \nD203.5 trillion. About D51.3 trillion of increasing infrastructure spending will be financed by \ngovernment deposit and D49.4 trillion will be financed from external concessional borrowing. \nBased on the existing regulation, the Government cannot finance an increasing budget deficit \nfrom external commercial sources. The proposed VIE-CS loan amount of $500 million, other \nADB program loans amounting to a combined $100 million, and other development partners\u2019 \nprograms  and  commercial  borrowings  will  help  close  the  financing  gap  for  2009.  The \nGovernment plans to close the remainder by issuing domestic bonds.  \n \nTable 4: Projected Financing Requirements of the Government of Viet Nam for 2009 \n(D trillion) \nProposed \nFinancing Mix  Amount \nGross Financing Requirements  203.5 \nLess Amortization  34.7 \n   \nNet Financing Requirement  168.8 \nProgrammed Gross Net External Borrowings  49.4 \nof which:   \nADB\u2019s Proposed Loan Pipeline   \nCountercyclical Support Facility  8.8 \nSupport for the Implementation of the Poverty Reduction Program  1.8 \n   \nOther Multilateral and Bilateral Agencies  37.8 \n   \nNet Domestic Financing   70.8 \n Of which government deposits  51.3 \nFinancing Gap  48.5 \nADB = Asian Development Bank. \nNote: Exchange rate: $1 = D17,600 \nSources: Ministry of Finance and Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nVI.

SBV will be the Executing Agency responsible for overall execution and coordination of \nthe Government's countercyclical program and for reporting to ADB.  The Government will \nestablish a committee, chaired by MPI, comprising officials from SBV, MOF, and other line \nministries. The committee will be responsible for monitoring and overseeing the implementation \nof the Government's countercyclical programs supported under the CSF loan. The committee \nwill meet quarterly to report on progress of implementation of the Government's countercyclical \nprograms supported under the loan. The committee will also report on overall progress of the \nGovernment's countercyclical public expenditure program. ADB may be invited to participate in \nsome of the meetings as an observer.  At the implementation level, SBV and MOF will be \nresponsible for administering the disbursement of loan proceeds from ADB and maintaining \naccounts. MPI will select and submit the proposals for activities to be supported under the CSF \nloan. The line ministries will assist SBV in monitoring activities carried out by their ministries. \n ", "                           17\n    \nB.  Period and Tranching \n37.  The period specified for VIE-CS will be from 1 September 2009 to 31 December 2010, \nwith a single tranche loan of $500 million to be disbursed when the Government has met the \nconditions for loan effectiveness. \n \nC.  Procurement and Disbursement  \n38.  The loan of $500 million will be released in a single tranche upon loan effectiveness.

Items  specified  in  the  list  of  ineligible  items \n(Appendix 8) and imports financed by other bilateral and multilateral sources are excluded. In \naccordance  with  the  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s  Disbursement  Procedures,  loan  proceeds  will  be \ndisbursed to Viet Nam as the Borrower.14 No supporting import documentation will be required if \nduring each year that loan proceeds are expected to be disbursed the value of Viet Nam\u2019s total \nimports minus imports from nonmember countries, ineligible imports, and imports financed \nunder other official development assistance is equal to or greater than the amount of the loan \nexpected to be disbursed during such year. The Government will certify its compliance with this \nformula  with  each  withdrawal  request.  Otherwise,  import  documentation  under  existing \nprocedures will be required. Disbursements will be made under the simplified procedures for \nprogram  loans.  In  accordance  with  the  simplified  disbursement  procedures  and  related \nrequirements  for  program  loans,  all  goods  and  services  produced  and  originating  in  ADB \nmember  countries  will  be  procured,  with  due  consideration  to  economy  and  efficiency,  in \naccordance  with  the  Government\u2019s  standard  public  procedures  and  normal  private  sector \ncommercial  practices  acceptable  to  ADB.  Goods  commonly  traded  on  the  international \ncommodity market will be procured in accordance with procedures appropriate to the trade and \nacceptable to ADB.  \n \nD.  Anticorruption and Fiduciary Issues \n39.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the Government. Consistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability, and \ntransparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged \ncorrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the VIE-CS. To support these \nefforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the loan regulations \nand the bidding documents for the VIE-CS. In particular, all contracts financed by ADB in \nconnection with the VIE-CS shall include provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and \nexamine the records and accounts of the Executing Agency and all contractors, suppliers, \nconsultants, and other service providers as they relate to the Project. \n \n40.  The Government agreed to publish the Country Fiduciary Assessment completed in \npartnership with the World Bank, ADB, and other development partners in October 2008. 15 \nWhile noting progress made in PFM reforms, the assessment points out some areas for further \nimprovement. Implementation of the 2002 State Budget Law and the 2005 Accounting Law is \nprogressing. However, the State Budget Law and the Accounting Law need to be updated \ncomprehensively.

Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n41.  ADB retains the right to audit the use of loan proceeds and to verify the accuracy of the \nGovernment\u2019s certification for withdrawal applications. Before withdrawal, the Government will \nopen a deposit account at the central bank (State Bank of Viet Nam) to receive all loan \nproceeds. The account will be managed, operated, and liquidated in accordance with terms \nsatisfactory to ADB.  \n \nF.  Performance Monitoring, Evaluation, and VIE-CS Review \n42.  In cooperation with the Executing Agency (para. 36), during the period specified for the \ncountercyclical  programs,  ADB  will  carry  out  semiannual  reviews  of  macroeconomic \nperformance and implementation of the Government\u2019s countercyclical expenditure program and \nreport to the Board. The mechanism for the proposed VIE-CS loan comprises of three parts: \n(i) an  established  interagency  coordination  committee  (and  process)  for  monitoring  and \nreporting, (ii) use of country PFM systems for monitoring budget execution of projects and \nprograms supported under the VIE-CS loan and listed in Table 3, and (iii) ADB surveys and \ndevelopment partners\u2019 mechanisms for monitoring selected projects supported under the loan. \n \n43.  The coordinating committee (process). MPI will be the focal point for the coordinating \ncommittee, comprising relevant agencies including SBV, MOF, and line ministries. SBV will be \nthe coordinator for macroeconomic performance monitoring, and MPI in coordination with MOF \nand relevant line ministries will report on implementation of the countercyclical program. ADB \nstaff will meet with the coordinating committee on a quarterly basis and a report for the loan will \nbe done on a semiannual basis. MOF will provide budget disbursement data of the relevant \nspending line ministries for the countercyclical program. MPI and relevant line ministries will \nprovide field data on selected program implementation. \n \n44.  Monitoring macroeconomic performance. ADB will review and assess developments \nin the key macroeconomic indicators presented and described in the access criteria matrix in \nAppendix 2, including quarterly fiscal data and budget outturns, public debt ratios, external \nbalance, and a monetary survey. In assessing the macroeconomic performance, it will draw on \nMOF\u2019s  monthly  reviews  of  implementation  of  the  fiscal  stimulus  package,  IMF  reports  on \nViet Nam (including its annual Article IV Consultations with the Government) and the selected \nissues and, and any other relevant materials. ADB staff will also draw on the reports and results \nof the broader dialogue over, and monitoring and evaluation of, reforms under the PRSC and \nSIPRP series which are presented to the Consultative Group Meeting on a semiannual basis. \n \n                                                 \n16 World Bank. 2009.

Adverse Impact of    Summary: Viet Nam\u2019s economy has been adversely impacted by the global economic crisis in \nthe Global Economic  several ways. Since its accession to the WTO, economic growth has been increasingly more \nCrisis  reliant on FDI and exports. In 2008, FDI contributed about 32% of total investments. Total \nexports in the same year were equivalent to 78% of GDP. FDI approvals in the first 6 months of \n2009 have declined by about 75%. Exports also declined by 10.2% during the same period. \nTourist arrivals also dropped by 19%. Although economic growth for the fist half of the year \nremained resilient at 3.9%, without strong domestic efforts and fiscal stimulus, poverty incidence \nis projected to increase significantly. \n  Economic growth  Economic growth for the first half of the year contracted to 3.9%, about 3\u20134 percentage points \nbelow recent annual average growth. This is significantly below the rate needed to sustain \npoverty reduction and create jobs to meet the needs of the expanding labor force. \n  Exports and  Exports, excluding re-export of gold, also declined by 10.2% during the same period. Tourist \ninvestment  arrivals also dropped by 19%. FDI disbursements dropped by 18.4 and FDI approvals declined \nby about 75%.in the first 6 months of 2009. \n  Remittances  The inflow of remittances have also been affected by the global economic downturn, estimated to \nhave declined by 26% from $3.7 billion in the first half of 2008 to $2.7 billion in the first half of \n2009. \n  Fiscal deficit  To accommodate the fiscal stimulus, the Government plans to increase the budget deficit  from \n4.7% to 7.0% of GDP, a, as approved by the National Assembly in June 2009. However, as most \nof the fiscal stimulus package is off-budget, budget deficit including off-budget operation is much \nhigher\u2014projected at about 10.3% of GDP. \n  Tax revenue  Tax revenue has softened because of weakening growth, declining trade flows, and the tax-\ncollection  related stimulus package. Actual domestic revenue collected for the first 6 months is about 5.1% \nbelow target specified in the 2009 budget plan. However, the revenue target for 2009 is very \nconservative\u2014about 3% of GDP below actual collection in 2008. \n  Impact on sovereign  Five-year bond yields increased to 20.3% in June 2008 from about 8.7% before the crisis in \nbond yields  January 2008. Yields have gradually declined to around 9.5% since April 2009.  \n2. Countercyclical    The Government is implementing a countercyclical program containing (i) a combination of \nExpenditure Program  temporary tax reductions and deferral for small and medium-sized enterprises and selected \nsectors,  (ii) an  interest  subsidy scheme  for  eligible  enterprises,  (iii)  infrastructure spending \nA\nfocusing on roads and irrigation, and (iv) social safety net related spending for the poor.  p\np\n  Increased  The stimulus package includes a plan to advance the implementation of critically important  en\nd\ninfrastructure  projects from 2010 and investments to be financed by revenue brought forward from the 2008  ix\nspending  budget.  The  investments  focus  on  infrastructure  contributing  to  the  country\u2019s  medium-term   2\ngrowth, including roads and irrigation.  \n2\n5\n ", "   \nCSF Access Criteria  Indicators  ADB Assessment  2\n6\n  Social assistance  The  Government\u2019s  social  assistance  program  includes  (i)  support  for  the  poorest  districts,   \nprograms  (ii) housing support for 0.5 million rural households, and (iii) a new year (Tet) bonus for the poor. \nThe Government also provides an interest rate subsidy for working capital loans for enterprises  A\np\nwith a viable work plan. The latter is important since preventing a collapse in economic activity is  p\ne\nn\ncritical to mitigate social impacts of the crisis, given that the social insurance system is still in an  d\nearly stage of development.  ix 2\n3. Sound    Summary. The Government has improved its macroeconomic management and learned from   \nMacroeconomic  experience. Viet Nam entered the current global financial crisis with economic overheating \nManagement  resulting  from  massive  capital  inflows.  Strong  and  coordinated  policy  measures  by  the \nGovernment and SBV succeeded in arresting accelerating inflation pressures and reducing the \ntrade deficit to manageable levels. The Government introduced fiscal stimulus measures while \neasing monetary policy appropriately to respond to weakening growth prospects. \n  Monetary policy and  Monetary policy was loosened cautiously through a combination of measures. SBV lowered its \ninflation  policy rate from 14% in October 2008 to 7% in May 2009, and reduced the reserve requirement \nratio from 11% in early November 2008 to 3% since March 2009. To ease liquidity in the banking \nsystem further, SBV purchased back compulsory bonds placed in commercial banks. It also \nwidened the exchange rate trading band to +/\u20135% from +/\u20133% to increase exchange rate \nflexibility to allow for a larger role of exchange rate adjustment to absorb the impacts of external \nshocks. Inflation declined rapidly to 2.0% in August 2009 from the peak of 28.3% in August \n2008. \n  Adjustment policy  SBV upgraded its supervision efforts considerably and raised minimum capital requirements for \nmeasures to  smaller banks. This measure has strengthened the resilience of the banking system during the \naddress the financial  crisis. The interest rate subsidy program for working capital loans for eligible enterprises has \ncrisis  played an important role in keeping credit flowing in the first half of 2009. \n  Debt sustainability  Public debt is sustainable. Although the fiscal deficit has been historically large (average of 4% in \nanalysis  2005\u20132008), the latest International Monetary Fund\u2013World Bank debt sustainability analysis1 \nsuggests that both external and domestic debt positions are sustainable; the external debt \nservices ratios is 3.4% to exports and 3.5% to government revenue. This is because most debt is \nconcessional,  with  a  low  fixed  interest  rate  and  well  spread  out  maturities.  Public  debt \nsustainability analysis suggests that a significant increase in debt-creating fiscal stimulus and a \n30% nominal depreciation of the dong would increase the debt ratio significantly. However, even \nlarge negative shocks would not destabilize the present value of the debt ratio over the longer \nterm. \n  Public financial  The  larger  fiscal  deficit,  despite  its  temporary  nature,  will  increase  government  debt  and \nmanagement  complicate fiscal management going forward. While Viet Nam is projected to remain well below \nsystems  all applicable external debt burden thresholds, even given the impact of the stimulus measures, \n                                                 \n1  Summarized from International Monetary Fund. 2009.

Economic Contraction  \n \n1.  The economy began to slow in 2008 and growth decelerated to 3.9% in the first half of \n2009 on a year-on-year basis. The sharp slowdown in growth was broad-based, with most \nmajor  economic  sectors  declining,  driven  by  the  export-oriented  manufacturing  sector. \nDepressed external demand for goods and sluggish foreign direct investment inflows were the \nprimary drivers behind the economic deceleration in the first quarter of 2009.   \n \n2.  Another way of looking at economic performance is the output gap, which measures the \ndifference between potential output and actual output measured in terms of gross domestic \nproduct (GDP) growth. A small output gap would suggest that the economy is at its long-run \ntrend or full employment. If growth exceeds the potential growth rate (i.e., a positive output gap), \nit would suggest that the economy risks overheating associated with above-trend inflation. If \nactual  growth  is  below  potential  (i.e.,  a  negative  output  gap),  this  suggests  an  economic \ndownturn usually associated with below trend inflation. Asian Development Bank (ADB) staff \nestimates indicate Viet Nam\u2019s potential economic growth in 2009 the range of 6%\u20137%. Figure \nA3 shows the emergence of a significant output gap in 2009, projected at about 4% (in the \nabsence of the fiscal stimulus), similar in magnitude to the one that emerged in the late 1980s. \nInflation is subdued, indicative of suppressed aggregate demand.  \n \n \nFigure A3: Output Gap and Fiscal Response \n (a) Potential and Actual Economic Growth, 1980\u20132009   (b) GDP Growth With and Without Fiscal Stimulus                                    \n9\n12\n8\n10\n7\n8\nth6\nh6 w\nwt ro5\no4 g\ngr P4\nP 2 D\nD G3\n G0 %2\n%\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2\n-29 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 0 0 0 0 0 1\n8 8 8 8 8 9 9 9 9 9 0 0 0 0 0\n0 2 4 6 8 0 2 4 6 8 0 2 4 6 8\n-4 0\n-6 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010\nPotential Growth Actual Growth With Fiscal Expansion Without Fiscal Expansion\n \nGDP = gross domestic product. \nNotes: Viet Nam's potential economic growth rate is estimated using the Hodrick-Prescott filter, which estimates a \nnonlinear trend in the economic growth data.

Impact of the Government\u2019s Countercyclical Public Spending Program   \n \n3.  Economic  stimulus  effects. In times of a negative output gap, governments  may \nstimulate the economy through a combination of policy instruments such as (i) expansionary \nmonetary policy, therefore lowering interest rates to stimulate investment and consumption; and \n(ii)  fiscal  expansion  through  tax  cuts  and  increasing  discretionary  public  spending.  An \nappropriate fiscal expansion will depend on its size relative to the output gap and the multiplier \n(or second-round) effects of the different components of the fiscal stimulus. Empirical evidence \nfor  other  countries  indicates  that  infrastructure  spending  has  the  largest  multiplier  effects, \nfollowed by cash transfers to poor families; tax breaks have the lowest multiplier effects, as \nsome proportion will be saved. \n \n4.  The Government is using both instruments to stimulate the economy. In aggregate, the \nnational government budget deficit is projected at 10.3% of GDP or an expansion of 6.2% over \n2008 (budget deficit of 4.1% in 2008). Adjusting for budget revenue reductions in 2009 over \n2008 levels, the estimated fiscal stimulus is lower at 3.2%. This expansion is equivalent to about \nthird-quarters of the negative output gap, indicating a sufficient expansion.  \n \n5.  ADB staff estimates that without the fiscal stimulus, economic growth could bottom at \nabout 2% in 2009 and recover to about 5.5% in 2010 in line with a modest global economic \nrecovery. With the fiscal stimulus, economic growth is projected to pick up to 4.7% in 2009. The \nfiscal response is expected to carry over into early 2010 at a much smaller magnitude.  \n \n6.  Poverty impacts. The economic slowdown of about 3%\u20134% of GDP in 2009 will reduce \nper capita income growth to 1.5%\u20133.5% in 2009. This could increase poverty in the short run \nthrough a weak labor market and reduced household earnings. Over the medium term, a slow \neconomic recovery will create persistently high unemployment and suppressed earnings in the \ninformal sector, as new labor market entrants outstrip new jobs created. This in turn will lead to \npersistently  higher  poverty.  The  Government\u2019s  fiscal  stimulus  will  partially  offset  the \nunemployment and poverty impacts of the crisis, but an economic growth of about 6%\u20137% in \n2011 is necessary to ensure a sustained reversal of the adverse effects of the economic \nslowdown on poverty. The extension of the poverty reduction efforts in the country\u2019s 61 poorest \ndistricts  and  an  improved  social  security  system  will  also  be  important  contributors  to  a \nreduction in longer term poverty. The increased spending in social assistance programs and the \ntax relief program will have an immediate positive impact on the poor. The subsidy scheme to \nkeep business afloat during this difficult period will also have an immediate positive impact on \nthe labor market and the incomes of the poor. The larger infrastructure projects will affect the \neconomy and create jobs once the necessary financing and the procurement process have \nbeen completed and investments made\u2014most likely in the second semester of 2009 and in \nearly 2010. \n ", " \nPOVERTY IMPACT ASSESSMENT MATRIX  3\n0\n   \nSupport for the Government\u2019s Countercyclical Public Spending Program (CPSP). The global economic crisis is likely to hurt the poor in the short and medium \nterm through three potential channels: (i) the weak labor market, as hiring activity across most sectors has slowed and job destruction in the traditional export sector A\np\nhas increased unemployment in 2009; (ii) reduction of employment opportunities caused by a sharp reduction in foreign direct investment, which has contributed  p\ne\nsignificantly in the recent past; and (iii) reduced household incomes caused by the weaker economy.

This will lead to persistently \nhigher poverty.

The extension of the poverty reduction efforts in the \ncountry\u2019s 61 poorest districts and an improved social security system will also be important contributors to a reduction in longer term poverty.  \n \nTime dimensions. The increased spending in social assistance programs and tax relief program will have an immediate positive impact on the poor. The subsidy \nscheme to keep businesses afloat during this difficult period will also have an immediate positive impact on the labor market and the incomes of the poor. The larger \ninfrastructure projects will affect the economy and create jobs once the necessary financing and procurement process have been completed and investments made\u2014\nmost likely in the second semester of 2009 and in early 2010.  \nA\nCrucial Assumptions  p\np\nThe multiplier effects of public spending is 0.8 of the initial disbursement. The Government advances procurement and is able to obtain the necessary financing and  e\nn\nmake substantial progress toward advancing the urgent projects in transport and irrigation, infrastructure development, social housing, health, and education projects dix\nin 2009 from 2010.    4\n \nCPSP = Countercyclical Public Spending Program, GDP = gross domestic product, FDI = foreign direct investment. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n  3\n1\n \n ", "32   Appendix 5 \nSUMMARY OF DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ASSESSMENT1 \n \n1.  Background. Viet Nam\u2019s debt position at the end of 2008 was estimated at 44.4% of \ngross domestic product (GDP), 56% of which (24.9% of GDP) is external debt. The Government \nhas been prudent in external lending. Most of the country\u2019s debt is at concessional, low interest \nrates with a well spread out maturity structure. With support from multilateral and bilateral \ndevelopment partners, the country\u2019s debt is fairly diversified in terms of currency composition. \nDomestic public debt is also manageable. Its average implied interest rate at the end of 2008 \nwas about 6%. However, the bulk of amortization will fall due within 1\u20133 years. Viet Nam has \nstrong access to significant non-debt-creating financing from strong private remittances and \nlarge foreign direct investment (FDI). \n \n2.  Main assumptions. The baseline scenario assumes the following:  \n \n(i)  Real GDP growth will average 6.5% per year during 2009\u22122013 (below the last \n10-year  historical  average  of  7.2%)  and  will  decline  gradually  thereafter  as \nViet Nam\u2019s level of development begins to converge with its more advanced \nneighbors.  \n(ii)  Inflation will decline from an average of 23% in 2008 to 6% in 2009 and will \nremain  at  that  level  through  2013.  Inflation  will  further  decline  thereafter, \nreflecting productivity gains. \n(iii)  The average interest rate of foreign borrowing will rise gradually from around 3% \nin 2008 to above 4% by 2028, reflecting a declining share of concessional loans. \n(iv)  The primary fiscal deficit (including off-budget expenditure and net lending) will \nrise to 6.5% in 2009 and gradually fall to 3% of GDP in 2013, and decline further \nto 2% on average during 2014\u20132028.  \n(v)  Net capital inflows will fall from about 10% of GDP in 2008 to 8% in 2013 and \nstabilize thereafter. \n(vi)  Government financing from the fiscal stimulus and contingent liabilities are not \nincluded in the base line scenario. \n \n3.  External debt sustainability. Under the baseline scenario, the present value of external \ndebt is projected to increase slightly in the short term, but will decline over the longer term. \nReflecting a very open and dynamic characteristic of the economy, the present value of external \ndebt as a share of exports is low and projected to decline from 27% in 2007 to 13.5% in 2028. In \n2008, the debt service ratios in relation to exports (3.4%) and to revenue (3.5%) were low. The \ntwo ratios are projected to decline after an initial increase. Stress tests indicate that external \ndebt is most sensitive to exchange rate depreciation and a loss of access to non-debt-creating \nflows. A 30% one-time depreciation of the dong would increase the present value of external \ndebt in relation to GDP by 8 percentage points relative to the baseline. A loss of access to non-\ndebt-creating flows will increase the present value of external debt by 3 percentage points by \n2013. A loss of access to concessional loans would have a similar negative effect but with a \nlonger time horizon.  \n \n4.  Public debt sustainability. Public debt management is likely to be more challenging \nbecause of a significant deterioration in the overall fiscal balance. The present value of public \ndebt in relation to GDP is projected to rise from 37% in 2008 to 46% in 2013, and thereafter \ngradually decline to 43% by 2028. The ratio could be higher, depending on the size of the fiscal \n                                                 \n1  Summarized from International Monetary Fund. 2009.

The debt service-to-revenue ratio is projected to increase from 6.3% in 2008 to 11.5% \nin 2013 because of lower oil revenue, before starting to decline gradually. Stress tests indicate \nthat the present value of the public debt\u2013GDP ratio is most sensitive to an increase in debt-\ncreating flows and nominal exchange rate depreciation. A one-time 30% nominal depreciation of \nthe dong will increase the present value of public debt by 7 percentage points of GDP by 2013 \nrelative  to  the  baseline  (Figure  A5).  Similarly,  an  increase  in  debt-creating  flows  by \n10 percentage points of GDP would increase the present value of public debt by 8 percentage \npoints of GDP relative to the baseline. The stress tests underscore the need for prudent fiscal \npolicy. The debt service\u2013revenue ratio would triple or more (relative to its initial level) under the \nhigher debt-creating flows scenario and under the depreciation scenario. \n \n5.  Implications of the Countercyclical Support Facility Loan. The loan of $500 million \nhas  a  term  of  5  years  with  a  3-year  grace  period.  Two  principal  repayments,  each  of  \n$250 million, will be made in the fourth and fifth year, i.e., 2013 and 2014. Each repayment \nrepresents about 0.25% of GDP. As noted above, Viet Nam has a well spread out debt maturity \nstructure,  suggesting  that  in  general  the  underlying  sustainability  scenarios  will  not  be \nsignificantly impacted by the loan.  \n \n6.  Conclusion.  Viet Nam remains at low risk of external debt distress. The projected \nexternal  debt  ratios  remain  well  below  normal  indicative  thresholds  even  under  the  most \nextreme of the standard shocks normally considered. Total public debt, however, is expected to \nbe adversely affected by the ongoing global economic downturn. The above results, however, \ndepend on the assumptions underlying the projections. A risk that deserves special attention is \nthe possible impact of potential Government contingent liabilities that could arise from the need \nto recapitalize some banks or to deal with problems in state-owned enterprises. The latest data \nsuggest  that  the  banking  sector  is  coping  well  with  economic  downturn,  due  to  stronger \neconomic recovery, rebound in the construction sector, and the conservative collateral policy. \nProvided that the stimulus package is prudently financed and that the Government expands its \nrevenue base to more than offset the expected loss of oil revenue in the long run, the burden of \npublic debt would be manageable. \n \n \nFigure A5: Viet Nam Debt Sensitivity Analysis for Public Debt, 2008\u22122028 \n \n(% of GDP) \n   \n   \n    60\n   \n50\n   \n    40\n   \n

Department/  Southeast Asia Department/ \n \nModality:  support facility loan  Division:  Finance, Public Management and Trade Division \n       \nI.  POVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.   Link to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy \n \nViet Nam\u2019s poverty reduction strategy is embedded in the Socio-Economic Development Plan (SEDP) 2006\u20132010, which \nprovides for a broad range of policy reforms and a large number of investment projects aimed at reducing poverty. One of its \ntargets is to reduce the poverty rate (based on the methodology of the Ministry of Labor, Invalids, and Social Affairs) from \n20.2% in 2005 to 10%\u201311% in 2010. The SEDP 2006\u20132010 also aspires to strengthen the foundations for environmentally \nsustainable and socially inclusive economic growth and a continued reduction in poverty beyond 2010. The joint International \nDevelopment Association\u2013International Monetary Fund staff advisory note of 5 December 2006 on Viet Nam\u2019s poverty \nreduction strategy concluded that the SEDP 2006\u20132010 has the key features of a poverty reduction strategy and is likely to \nlead to economic growth and poverty reduction.a \n \nThe Asian Development Bank (ADB) country strategy and program (2007\u20132010)b for Viet Nam is aligned with the SEDP 20\n2010. It provides for assistance to the Government in both carrying out the policy reforms and implementing the investment proj\nthat are needed for successful implementation of the SEDP 2006\u20132010. Its primary focus is on promoting business-led, pro-p\neconomic growth by developing infrastructure, improving the business environment, strengthening financial and related ma\ninstitutions, and building up human capital. The country strategy and program also aims to foster social inclusiveness, enha\nmanagement of the environment, and improve governance.c   The Countercyclical Support Facility (CSF) supplements finan\nfrom other ADB programs such as the proposed second subprogram of the Support for the Implementation of the Pov\nReduction Program (SIPRP), scheduled for consideration by ADB\u2019s Board of Directors in October 2009. The SIPRP supports\nGovernment\u2019s medium-term policy reform efforts that are needed for the successful implementation of its SEDP 2006\u201320\nincluding  in  the  areas  of  public  financial  management  and  pubic  administration,  tax  administration  reform,  investm\ncompetitiveness, natural resource management, and social protection. \n \nThe proposed VIE-CS comes at a critical time for Viet Nam and is designed to support the Government in its efforts in coping \nwith the impacts of the worst global recession since World War II.    \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                  Targeting Classification: General intervention \n \n1.  Key Issues  \n \nViet Nam has been severely affected by the global economic downturn because of the country\u2019s increasing dependence on \nforeign direct investment (FDI) inflows and exports to support its high economic growth rate since its successful accession to \nthe World Trade Organization (WTO) in January 2007. FDI disbursement dropped by 18.4 and exports declined by about \n10.2% in the first half of 2009. Remittance inflows and tourist arrivals also dropped significantly. The global financial crisis also \naffected the Government\u2019s market access for budget financing. As a result, the Government has not issued any bond \ndomestically  since  early  2009  as  bond  yields  in  the  market  remain  significantly  higher  than  the  ceilings  set  by  the \nGovernment. The Government is concerned about the potential adverse poverty impacts of significantly slower economic \ngrowth. Because of the country\u2019s young demographic profile, about 1.7 million young workers enter the labor force annually. \nDuring 2006\u20132007, with gross domestic product (GDP) growth averaging 7.6%, only about 800,000 jobs were created \nannually.  Since  growth  is  projected  to  decline  to  5%  or  less,  unemployment  and  underemployment  could  increase \nsignificantly. At the same time, the social security system is still in a very early stage of its development. The Government\u2019s \ncash transfer program has limited coverage, and is fraught with implementation problems. Therefore, preventing a collapse of \neconomic activities and sustaining employment are the most effective social security response. \n \n2.  Design Features  \n \nThe VIE-CS provides budget support for the Government\u2019s countercyclical public spending program in infrastructure and the \nsocial sectors. It is aimed to ensure predictability in budget financing for 2009, as a larger national government budget deficit \nis required than initially planned.  \n \n \n ", "    Appendix 7  37\nC.  Poverty Impact Analysis for Policy-Based Lending \nThe VIE-CS supports the Government\u2019s countercyclical public expenditure program for 2009. The countercyclical programs \ninclude components that directly support the poor to cope with the impacts of the global crisis, including (i) support for the \npoorest districts, (ii) housing support for 0.5 million rural households, and (iii) a new year (Tet) bonus for the poor. The \nGovernment also provides an interest rate subsidy for working capital and medium-term investment loans for enterprises \ngiven that preventing a collapse in economic activity is critical to mitigate the social impacts of the crisis. The Government\u2019s \ncountercyclical spending program also includes a significant increase in capital spending that will support job creation to \nprevent an increase in poverty incidence. \n \nII.  SOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.  Findings of Social Analysis \nWhile the Government\u2019s countercyclical programs are likely to affect all population groups in Viet Nam, they are likely to have \na relatively large impact on the poor, ethnic minorities, the rural population, and people who can be adversely affected by the \nglobal financial crisis. The poverty rate based on the methodology of the Ministry of Labor, Invalids, and Social Affairs \nsuggests that 11.3 million people lived below the official poverty line in 2008. According to the household survey data, \n13.5 million people lived in poverty and 5.7 million people suffered from hunger in 2006. Rural areas accounted for 73.3% of \nthe total population but 93.6% of the poor. Ethnic minorities made up only 13.5% of the total population but 44.4% of the \npoor.d  Without the countercyclical programs to support economic growth at this challenging time caused by the global crisis, \npoverty incidence could increase by 1 million\u20132 million. \n \nB.  Consultation and Participation \n \n1.  Provide a summary of consultations and participation during the project preparation. \n \nThe VIE-CS is being implemented in parallel with the SIPRP Program. The Viet Nam Development Report 2007 provides \nanalytical underpinnings for the SIPRP V and, in particular, its subprogram 2. The report was jointly prepared by 16 \ndevelopment agencies (including ADB) in 2006. It analyzes medium-term development challenges facing Viet Nam and \nreviews the Government\u2019s strategy for overcoming these challenges (as set out in the SEDP 2006\u20132010). It also proposes a \nset of policy actions aimed at successful implementation of the SEDP 2006\u20132010. Some of these actions were covered by \nsubprogram 1 of the SIPRP V. \n \nSubprogram 2 of the SIPRP V is to support actions included in the policy matrix for the Eighth Poverty Reduction Support \nCredit Program (PRSC 8), focusing on actions that complement those supported by ADB\u2019s other program loans to Viet Nam \nor that are otherwise important to ADB operations in the country. In late 2008, the development agencies participating in the \nPRSC process (including ADB) agreed among themselves\u2014as well as with the Government, civil society, and the private \nsector\u2014on the initial policy matrix for the PRSC 8. From December 2008 to May 2009, the development agencies and the \nGovernment held several rounds of consultations on the initial policy matrix for the PRSC 8. In May 2009, they agreed on the \nfinal policy matrix. The actions to be covered by subprogram 2 of the SIPRP were selected\u2014in consultation with the \nGovernment and various units within ADB\u2014from the actions included in the final policy matrix of the PRSC 8. \n \n2.

The country strategy1 and program (2007\u20132010) for Viet Nam of the Asian Development \nBank  (ADB)  focuses  primarily  on  promoting  business-led,  pro-poor  economic  growth  by \ndeveloping  infrastructure,  improving  the  business  environment,  strengthening  financial  and \nrelated market institutions, and building up human capital. The country strategy and program \nalso aims to foster social inclusiveness, enhance management of the environment, and improve \ngovernance. The fifth Support for the Implementation of the Poverty Reduction Program (SIPRP \nV)  operationalizes  the  country  strategy  through  a  program  cluster  consisting  of  three \nsubprograms. The first of its subprograms, with a single-tranche loan in the amount of about \n$25 million, was approved on 1 December 2008. The second subprogram is expected to be \npresented for approval by ADB\u2019s Board of Directors in October 2009. The intended impact of the \nSIPRP  V  is  a  continued  reduction  in  poverty  in  Viet  Nam  in  2008\u20132010  and  beyond.  Its \nexpected  outcome  is  the  successful  implementation  of  the  Government\u2019s  Socio-Economic \nDevelopment Plan (SEDP) 2006\u20132010,2 which will not only reduce poverty in 2006\u20132010, but \nalso  enhance  Viet  Nam\u2019s  economic  competitiveness  and  strengthen  the  foundations  for \ninclusive and sustainable growth and a continued reduction in poverty beyond 2010. To achieve \nthis outcome, the SIPRP V is to help the Government carry out policy reforms that are needed \nfor  successful  implementation  of  the  SEDP  2006\u20132010.  Specifically,  the  SIPRP  V  is  to \nsupport\u2014through the Poverty Reduction Support Credits (PRSC) process\u2014policy actions that \nare critical steps in carrying out the reforms and are important to ADB\u2019s operations in Viet Nam.  \n \n2.  The SIPRP V supports policy actions in the following four broad reform areas: \n \n(i)  Business  development.  Improving  the  financial  management  and  corporate \ngovernance  of  state-owned  enterprises  (SOEs),  developing  the  financial  and \nprivate sectors, and improving the quality of infrastructure services. Key policy \nactions in this area include (a) strengthening the financial management of SOEs \nand their investments in other entities, and defining the level of such investments; \n(b)  developing  a  regulatory  framework  to  enhance  monetary  policy \nimplementation and improve financial sector stability; (c) adopting a contingency \nplan to address potential adverse effects stemming from the global financial crisis \non the banking sector; (d) promoting development of small and medium-sized \nenterprises (SMEs) through revising regulations, formulating an action plan for \nsupporting industries, and improving coordination among responsible ministries; \n(e) adopting a pricing system for electricity from renewable energy and providing \nincentives  for  government  procurement  of  energy-efficient  equipment;  and \n(f) revising the road law to improve traffic safety through measures including \nbetter standards and strengthened supervision of commercial vehicle operators, \nand setting up a monitoring and evaluation framework for the implementation of \ngovernment policies post-World Trade Organization accession. \n \n(ii)  Social inclusion. Improving the quality of health care and education and access \nto these services by (a) formulating an education development strategy to 2020, \n(b) preparing a strategic plan to ensure prudential and effective investment of \nsocial  security  funds,  and  (c)  issuing  regulations  to  assign  institutional \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2006.

Strengthening  the  management  of  water \nresources and the protection of the environment by (a) transferring State Forestry \nEnterprise land to local authorities for reallocation to households, ethnic minority \ngroups, and private enterprises with focus on poor areas; (b) issuing regulations \nto ensure the financial sustainability of irrigation services and provide financial \nrelief for poor farmers; (c) allocating institutional responsibilities to develop a \nunified  national  sanitation  strategy;  (d)  adopting  a  national  action  plan  for \ninformation, education, and communication for personal hygiene, safe water, and \nenvironment sanitation; (e) approving a national target program on adaptation to \nclimate change and allocating institutional responsibilities for its implementation; \n(f) enhancing treatment of medical waste discharged by hospitals at both central \nand local levels; (g) adopting regulations for performance contracts for sewerage \nand drainage at local levels; and (h) adopting a legal framework for biodiversity \nprotection  to  clearly  delineate  and  better  administer  protected  areas,  and  to \nimprove the community consultation process. \n \n(iv)  Governance.  Enhancing  governance  by:  (a)  Improving  planning  processes, \nstrengthening  public  financial  management  and  pubic  administration,  and \nreducing corruption by conducting a midterm review of the SEDP 2006\u20132010 and \nstrengthening  a  results-based  approach  in  the  monitoring  and  evaluation \nframework for planning; (b) revising the investment laws to improve efficiency in \nstate  capital  expenditures  and  to  strengthen  the  management  of  public \ninvestment  projects;  (c)  formulating  the  public  debt  management  law, \nconsolidating the management of domestic and external debt; (d) conducting \npublic financial management reforms, including commitment accounting, vendor \nmanagement, and a new chart of accounts; (e) adopting procedures for annual \naudit plan, ensuring sufficient frequency and adequate provincial coverage; (f) \nsimplifying the procedures, strengthening the management, and improving the \nmonitoring  and  complaints  system  of  civil  judgments  execution;  (g)  adopting \nmerit-based  recruitment  in  the  recruitment,  appointment,  promotion,  and \ndismissal of civil servants; (h) developing indicators for monitoring and evaluating \nthe  implementation  of  public  administration  reform  and  provision  of  public \nadministrative services; and (i) issuing a comprehensive anticorruption strategy, \nsetting  out  preventive,  demand-side,  and  sector-specific  solutions,  and \nmonitoring mechanisms. \n \n3.  Key features of the SIPRP V include the following. First, it follows the program-based \napproach and is, in some respects, a continuation of SIPRPs I\u2013IV. It provides parallel financing \nwith the World Bank\u2019s PRSCs within the framework of the PRSC process. Like the SIPRP IV, it \nis  intended  to  help  the  Government  carry  out  policy  reforms  needed  for  the  successful \nimplementation  of  the  SEDP  2006\u20132010.  Second,  it  takes  the  program  cluster  approach \nconsisting  of  three  chronologically  ordered  subprograms  with  a  well-defined,  medium-term \nframework  specified  at  the  outset  and  including  completed  high-impact  reforms  prior  to \nconsideration  by  the  Board.  It  includes  triggers  for  subsequent  subprograms  to  ensure  a \ncontinuous dialogue between the Government, development partners, and stakeholders. Broad-\nbased,  well-targeted  policy  actions  designed  to  achieve  a  continued  reduction  in  poverty \nenhance Viet Nam\u2019s economic competitiveness and strengthen the foundations for inclusive and \nsustainable growth and a continued reduction in poverty beyond 2010. In this way, the SIPRP V \nprovides a coherent medium-term reform strategy with three discrete but linked subprograms \n ", "42   Appendix 9 \nand a strong emphasis on performance, as the decision on whether to proceed with the next \nsubprogram is contingent on overall satisfactory performance of the triggers. It recognizes the \nnecessity for flexibility in the reform measures, with provisions for incorporating lessons and \nresponding  to  changes  in  the  external  environment  in  the  design  of  the  subsequent \nsubprograms. \n ", "                       Appendix 10    43\n    \nFISCAL STIMULUS PACKAGES: INTERNATIONAL EXPERIENCE \n \n1.  This  appendix  summarizes  the  determinants  of  the  size  and  composition  of  fiscal \nstimulus packages and draws on the findings a number of recent International Monetary Fund \n(IMF) cross-country studies.1 Two sets of factors help explain the relative size of stimulus \npackages: (i) differences across countries in the need for stimulus, and (ii) differences in fiscal \nspace. \n \n2.  Need  for  stimulus.  The  magnitude  of  the  overall  fiscal  expansion  (including  both \ndiscretionary and nondiscretionary components) should depend on the size of the output gap \nthat each country faces in the absence of fiscal support. The fiscal expansion in a particular \ncountry should also be larger if multipliers are lower.   \n \n3.  Composition of stimulus. Fiscal stimulus packages are typically comprised of (i) tax-\nrelated measures, (ii) social sector spending, and (iii) infrastructure expenditures. However, the \nweight given to any one of these components depends on preexisting fiscal characteristics. \nCountries in which the automatic stabilizers are smaller (e.g., those that have less extensive \nsocial benefits programs) will require greater discretionary stimulus\u2014this is true of most of the \ncountries  in  Asia  in  relation  to  developed  economies.  Tax  stimulus  measures  can  be \nimplemented relatively quickly and their impact is already being felt in the fiscal accounts. \nExpenditure measures, however, tend to proceed more slowly, reflecting normal budgetary \ncontrols and typical start-up delays in new programs. Multipliers, however, tend to be higher for \nexpenditure-related  stimulus  measures  than  for  tax-related  ones.  Figure  A10  provides  a \nbreakdown of the composition of stimulus packages in selected Southeast Asian countries. \nFinally,  coordination  of  stimulus  packages  across  countries  is  crucial  to  maximizing  their \neffectivity in the context of a global crisis. \n \n4.  Differences in fiscal space. Key factors that determine a country\u2019s fiscal space to \nexpand include levels of deficits, public debt, contingent liabilities, and interest rates.  Countries \nfacing relatively higher real interest rates or elevated debt levels have less room to expand; \ncompeting crisis-related needs, such as for financial sector support (mainly in the United States \nand Europe), are also factors in determining available fiscal space. \n \n5.  Increasing  fiscal  space.  The  available  fiscal  space  can  be  increased  through \nappropriate policy design. Ideally, a larger fiscal expansion in times of economic crisis can be \naccommodated if policy design increases the likelihood of a fiscal tightening once conditions \nimprove, to ensure long-term fiscal solvency. In this respect, the IMF has offered a number of \nrecommendations: \n \n(i)  Stimulus packages should not have permanent effects on deficits. Table A10.1 \nprovides  a  cross-country  comparison  of  stimulus  packages  in  terms  of  the \npermanent or temporary nature of their fiscal impact. \n(ii)  Medium-term fiscal frameworks should clarify governments\u2019 commitment to fiscal \ncorrection once economic conditions improve. \n(iii)  Structural reforms should be implemented to enhance growth, and thus medium-\nterm revenue prospects. \n                                                 \n1  IMF. 2009.

The necessary effort for each country to stabilize its level of debt and ensure long-run \nfiscal sustainability will depend on its own circumstances.2 In this respect, emerging economies \nin Southeast Asia may be more favorably placed than most advanced economies as they have \nlower initial debt positions, and are less subject to fiscal challenges brought about by aging \npopulations. Table A10.2 provides a cross-country comparison of debt positions and the debt-\nstabilizing primary balance needed to bring debt down to threshold levels commensurate with \nmaintaining market confidence as estimated by the IMF.3 \n \n \n \n                                                 \n2  The debt\u2013gross domestic product (GDP) ratio evolves according to the identity: \u0394 (D/Y), = (r-g/1+g)(D/Y) -pb, \nt-1\nwhere D is the debt stock, Y is GDP, r is the nominal interest rate, g is the nominal growth rate, pb is the primary \nfiscal balance as a share of GDP, and \u0394 indicates a change over the previous year.
