The  conditions  of  effectiveness  of  the \nADB2  grant  were  met  by  the  government  and  the  grant  was  declared  effective  on  10  March \n2010. The project is expected to close on 31 March 2012. \n \nThis  paper  seeks  approval  of  the  administration  by  ADB  of  new  cofinancing  grants \n2. \noffered by the Governments of Australia (A$300,000) and New Zealand (NZ$500,000) through \ntheir  international  development  agencies.  These  new  funds  have  been  offered  for  the \nrestoration  of  damaged  transport  infrastructure  in  west  Guadalcanal  caused  by  a  series  of \nfloods  between  January  and  March  2010.  The  restoration  of  damaged  infrastructure  will  re-\nconnect  a  population  of  about  12,000  people  in  west  Guadalcanal  to  food,  medical  supplies, \nschools, markets, and urban centers.  \n \n\nfor \n\nII. \n\nBACKGROUND \n\n3. \nSIRIP 2 aims to benefit about 41,000 people directly and to enhance the incomes of the \npoor  and  rural  population.  The  project  impact  is  expected  to  be  economic  growth  and  social \ndevelopment  and  a  reduction  in  hardship  and  poverty.  The  outcome  will  be  improved  road \ntransport  for  economic  and  social  activities.  Outputs  will  include  (i) an  improved  network  of \nnational, provincial, and secondary roads; (ii) sound and sustainable road maintenance policies \nand practices; and (iii) more participation by communities and women in road maintenance. Key \nactivities will include (i) replacing or upgrading about 30 water crossings (bridges, culverts, and \nwet  crossings);  (ii)  building  about  20  kilometers  (km)  of  associated  bridge  approaches,  and,  if \nnecessary,  relocating  sections  of  roads  for  climate  change  adaptation;  (iii)  upgrading  and \nsealing 10 km of road to prevent the loss of pavement materials during heavy rain and floods; \n(iv)  community  participation  in  road  maintenance;  and  (v)  continued  capacity  building  begun \nunder  the  Solomon  Islands  Road  Improvement  (Sector)  Project  (SIRIP)  3   for  national  staff, \nconsultants, and contractors. \n \nSIRIP 2 has two components: (i) civil works (road rehabilitation, road maintenance labor-\n4. \nbased, equipment-support methods and road maintenance); and (ii) consulting services (design \nand  supervision,  project  management  and  capacity  building).  The  Ministry  of  Infrastructure \nDevelopment (MID) is the executing agency for the project. The project is being implemented in \nGuadalcanal and Malaita provinces and, where funds allow, will also be extended to the seven \nother provinces, all of which have had insufficient investment in the past.4 \n                                                 \n1  ADB.  2009.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors  on  Proposed  Asian \nDevelopment  Fund  Grants  and  Administration  of  Grants  to  Solomon  Islands  for  Second  Road  Improvement \n(Sector) Project. Manila. (Grants 0175-SOL, 0176-SOL and 0177-SOL) \n\n2   On  11  February  and  8  March  2010,  commitment  letters  from  AusAID  and  European  Commission  respectively \nprovided  satisfactory  evidence  that  the  recipient  had  obtained  the  approval  of  their  respective  grants,  thereby \nsatisfying the conditions in declaring the ADB grant effective. \n\n3   ADB.  2007.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors  on  Proposed  Asian \nDevelopment  Fund  Grants  and  Administration  of  Grants  to  Solomon  Islands  for  Road  Improvement  (Sector) \nProject. Manila. (Grants 0048-SOL, 0049-SOL and 0050-SOL). \n\n4   The seven other provinces are Central, Choiseul, Isabel, Makira, Renbel, Temotu, and Western. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\n \n5. \nBetween  January  and  March  2010,  torrential  rain  and  flood  waters  damaged  bridge \napproaches  on  west  Guadalcanal  roads,  disconnecting  the  road  at  several  locations  from  the \ncapital, Honiara and severely disrupting transport services. The cost of reinstating the road and \nbridge  works,  including  consultancy  services  for  design  and  supervision,  is  approximately  \n$0.60 million. Because of a lack of funding, the Government of Solomon Islands, through MID, \nrequested its donor partners to assist with the required funds. \n \nIn  response  to  MID's  request,  the  Government  of  Australia  through  AusAID  committed \n6. \nA$300,000  and  the  Government  of  New  Zealand  through  the  New  Zealand  Agency  for \nInternational  Development  (NZAID)  committed  NZ$500,000  to  reinstate  the  road  to  restore \nconnectivity at the affected areas. The total additional funding amounts to $637,9945 and both \nAusAID  and  NZAID  have  requested  that  funds  be  specifically  used  to  restore  access  to  the \n12,000  people  who  have  been  cut  off.  These  funds  will  be  used  to  restore  connections  and \ninclude  the  costs  of  the  civil  works,  consulting  services,  audit,  bank  charges  and  ADB's  5% \nadministration fee. The additional funds will increase the overall project cost from $24,000,000 \nto $24,637,994, an increase of 2.7%. The increase in overall project costs and the expansion of \nscope  of  works  constitutes  a  minor  change  in  scope.  ADB,  as  the  lead  donor  in  transport \ninfrastructure  in  the  Solomon  Islands,  will  administer  the  AusAID  and  NZAID  grants.  MID  will \nprocure  all  works  and  goods  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Procurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as \namended from time to time) and will engage consultants in accordance with ADB's  Guidelines \non the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). The proceeds of the grants \nadministered by ADB will be disbursed through direct payment in accordance with ADB's Loan \nDisbursement Handbook (2007, as amended from time to time). The detailed cost estimates by \nfinancier are attached as the Appendix.  \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PRESIDENT'S RECOMMENDATION \n\nI  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  on  a  no  objection  basis  (i)  the  administration  by \n7. \nADB  of  the  grant  not  exceeding  A$300,000  to  Solomon  Islands  to  be  provided  by  the \nGovernment  of  Australia;  and  (ii)  the  administration  by  ADB  of  the  grant  not  exceeding \nNZ$500,000  to  Solomon  Islands  to  be  provided  by  the  Government  of  New  Zealand,  in  both \ncases for the Second Road Improvement (Sector) Project. \n\n                                                \n \n5  $1.00 equated to A$1.0715 and NZ$1.3966 as of 12 April 2010. \n\n \n\n\fDETAILED COST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING PLANa  \nORIGINAL 12 NOVEMBER 2009 \n($ million) \n \n\nItem \n\nA.
