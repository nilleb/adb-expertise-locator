I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan of \nup to B1,109 million (or its equivalent in US dollars) to Chana Green Company Limited for the \nSouthern Thailand Waste-to-Energy Project in Thailand. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Project Identification and Description \n2.  Project identification. Agriculture has played an important role in Thailand\u2019s economic \ndevelopment, but it has also led to serious environmental and social challenges in managing the \nmass amount of residual waste that is generated from the harvesting process. The agriculture \nsector of Thailand accounts for approximately 10% of the country\u2019s gross domestic product and \nnearly 40% of Thailand\u2019s population depend on farming for their main livelihood. Thailand is a \nmajor producer of rice, sugarcane, cassava, rubber, and palm oil. Thailand\u2019s agricultural products \nare estimated to produce over 80 million tons of waste a year. Rural households utilize small \namounts of agricultural waste to provide basic energy requirements for cooking and heating. \nHowever, the bulk of waste in Thailand is destined to be burned in the fields unless applications \nfor industrial use are sourced. Uncontrolled burning produces negative impacts on human health, \natmospheric visibility, soil, groundwater, and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The challenge \nfor Thailand and many other developing member countries (DMCs) is to find a solution to manage \nand reduce the agricultural waste in an environmentally and socially acceptable manner. Waste-\nto-energy (WTE) technology offers an effective solution by converting the agricultural waste, also \nknown as biomass, into a dependable and renewable source of commercial electricity. \n \n3.  Thailand\u2019s natural gas resources have long been a reliable source of low-cost energy, but \ngrowing  demand  and  dwindling  domestic  reserves  mean  that  it  must  find  new  fuels  and \ntechnologies to help meet its future power needs. Thailand\u2019s power consumption has risen by on \naverage 3.6% per year during 2005\u20132016 and demand is expected to double over the period from \n2015 to 2036. To meet its growing energy demand, Thailand has adopted the Alternative Energy \nDevelopment Plan, 2015\u20132036 (AEDP) which sets out targets for renewable energy deployment.1 \nThe plan contains a target of 30% of final energy consumption and 20% of installed electricity \ngeneration capacity from renewable energy sources by 2036. To meet these targets, biomass will \nbecome the second largest renewable power source after solar, attesting to the immense potential \nof residual waste from agriculture in the country. The AEDP sets out a target to increase the \ninstalled generating capacity of biomass to 5,570 megawatts (MW) by 2036 from its current \ninstalled capacity of 2,943 MW. \n \n4.  WTE plants that utilize biomass are prioritized in Thailand\u2019s renewable energy policy \nbecause of the additional advantage of supporting farmers and rural communities. Biomass WTE \npromotes rural development by contributing additional income to farmers who sell their agricultural \nwaste as well as small enterprises who engage in waste collection and transportation. Substituting \nfossil fuels with agricultural waste for power generation can also improve Thailand\u2019s energy \nsecurity, save foreign exchange by reducing the need for energy imports, and shield the economy \nfrom the impact of global energy price fluctuations. Further, biomass is a sustainable form of \npower generation because it has a carbon-neutral footprint. The biomass absorbs the same \namount of carbon during its cultivation cycle as it releases when consumed as a fuel. Unlike other \nrenewable energy technologies such as solar and wind, which are intermittent, WTE can also \n                                                \n1  Government of Thailand, Ministry of Energy. 2015.

", "2 \noperate on a firm, reliable, and dispatchable basis, providing a more direct substitute for base-\nload generation using fossil fuels. The substitution effectively reduces the grid\u2019s GHG emission \nfactor by displacing generation that otherwise would have been provided using fossil fuels. \n \n5.  The Ministry of Energy implements its WTE policy for biomass through the small power \nproducer (SPP) and very small  power producer programs. The programs allow for private \ndevelopers to build, own, and operate WTE power projects and enter into power purchase \nagreements  (PPAs)  with  Thailand\u2019s  state-owned  power  utility  companies,  the  Electricity \nGenerating Authority of Thailand (EGAT) and the Provincial Electricity Authority of Thailand. \nRenewable energy projects that utilize biomass are entitled to receive a B0.3 per kilowatt-hour \n(kWh) tariff incentive for 7 years in addition to the base wholesale electricity tariff. The tariff \nincentive is provided to promote investment in WTE technologies. \n \n6.  The southern-most provinces of Thailand are some of the poorest in the country. Political \nconflict and unrest in Southern Thailand has impeded investment, employment, and overall \ndevelopment and growth. The associated risk of investing in Southern Thailand has also led to \nunderinvestment in the local power system, which continues to experience energy shortages. To \nreduce risk and promote investment in the power sector of Southern Thailand,2 WTE power \nprojects are entitled to receive a special tariff incentive of B1.0 per kWh for 7 years in addition to \nthe B0.3 per kWh tariff. \n \n7.  Project design. The project entails the construction and operation of a 25 MW biomass \nWTE power project located in Chana, Songkhla province of Southern Thailand.  \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED  \n \n8.  The primary source of waste will be rubberwood sourced from local farmers, sawmills, and \nintermediary suppliers located within 150-kilometer (km) radius of the project site. All electricity \nproduced by the project will be purchased by EGAT under a 5-year, automatically renewable PPA \nwith a contracted capacity of 20.6 MW under the SPP program. The project will receive two tariff \nincentives in addition to the base wholesale electricity tariff. The tariff incentives include B0.3 per \nkWh for utilizing biomass and B1.0 per kWh for investing in Southern Thailand, both for a period \nof 7 years from commercial operations, after which time the project will only receive the base \nwholesale tariff.  \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED  \n \n9.  Borrower and sponsor. Chana Green, the borrower, is a project company set up to own, \ndevelop,  construct,  and  operate  the  project.  The  project  is  wholly  owned  by  Gulf  Energy \nDevelopment (GED), the sponsor, which is a leading private sector power generation company in \nThailand with the largest portfolio of gas-fired power projects in the country.3 Currently, the \ncompany has 10 operating gas-fired projects with total installed generation capacity of 4,373 MW, \nof which GED\u2019s equity capacity is 1,755 MW. GED is positioned for strong growth with the largest \npower project pipeline in Thailand. The company has an additional 7,022 MW of installed \ngeneration  capacity  currently  under  construction  and  development,  which  is  scheduled  to \ncommence commercial operations by 2024. As of May 2017, GED\u2019s total current portfolio, \n                                                \n2  Power projects located in Yala, Pattani, Narathiwat, and four subdistricts in Songkhla (Chana, Na Thawi, Saba Yoi, \nand Thepha) province are eligible for the B1.0 per kWh tariff incentive. \n3  CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED  \n ", "  3 \nincluding  projects  under  construction  and  under  development,  consists  of  four  gas-fired \nindependent power producers (IPPs) (8,976 MW), 19 gas-fired SPPs (2,395 MW), four rooftop-\nsolar very small power producers (0.60 MW), and the proposed Southern Thailand WTE project \n(25 MW). In addition, the company holds a 9% equity interest in SPCG Public Company Limited, \none of the largest solar power companies in Thailand with 36 solar farms totaling 260 MW.  \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED  \n \n10.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has a longstanding relationship with the sponsor \nsince 2007 when ADB supported the company during its first IPP bidding process. ADB provided \nlong-term debt for two of its IPP projects, the Nong Saeng Natural Gas Power Project and the \nAyudhaya Natural Gas Power Project (totaling 3,406 MW installed generating capacity), which \nrepresented the first project financing arrangements in Thailand with loan tenures of 23 years. \nThe Nong Saeng Natural Gas Power Project was recognized as one of the top 40 private\u2013public \npartnerships  (PPPs)  in  emerging  markets  by  the  International  Finance  Corporation  and \nInfrastructure Journal.4 The Ayudhaya Natural Gas Power Project received Project Finance Deal \nof the Year (2012) from Project Finance International. \n \n11.

Projected Financial and Economic Performance \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED  \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \nA.  The Assistance \n19.  The proposed ADB assistance includes a local currency loan not exceeding B1,109 million \nor its equivalent in US dollars, with a tenor of up to 18 years. The longer repayment period of the \nADB loan is necessary to lower the operational debt service leverage over the life of the project. \nReducing the project\u2019s asset\u2013liability mismatch by amortizing the high up-front capital costs over \na longer period improves the project\u2019s economic viability. The limited availability of long-term \nfinancing in Southern Thailand is a market failure due to the macro and political instability in the \nregion. Accessing short-term debt to finance long-term assets results in higher liquidity risk and \nfirm-level economic volatility. This impacts the willingness of developers to invest in long-term \ninfrastructure assets, which ultimately hampers the level and growth of economic activity in the \nregion. \n \nB.  Value-Added by ADB Assistance \n20.  ADB\u2019s financial assistance will help provide an environmentally sustainable solution to the \nabundant agricultural waste that is produced from farming and wood industries by converting \nbiomass into a renewable source of electricity. ADB\u2019s assistance helps the long-term economic \nviability of the project, supports the government\u2019s renewable energy program and targets, and \nvalidates the WTE business model in a DMC. The demonstration effect from ADB\u2019s assistance \nhelps reduce the risk perception associated with WTE projects and creates awareness of the \nbenefits and sustainability of WTE that can be applied to other rural communities and DMCs. \n \n21.  ADB\u2019s 18-year financing of a private sector project in Southern Thailand signals long-term \nconfidence to other banks and developers considering investing in infrastructure assets within the \nregion. Economic development in Southern Thailand has been hindered by underinvestment due \nto political conflict and unrest. Access to financial credit is limited, especially long-term financing \nthat is required for large infrastructure projects. ADB\u2019s financing intervention goes beyond the \nproject and sector to encourage investment more broadly in other types of infrastructure projects \nand industries seeking capital within the Southern Thailand region.

In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project is classified as \ncategory B for the environment and category C for involuntary resettlement and indigenous \npeoples. An initial environmental examination report was submitted to the Office of the Natural \nResources and Environment Policy and Planning and is expected to be approved in October \n2017. The project site and its immediate vicinity do not support natural vegetation of any \necological significance. The potential environmental and social impacts of the project have been \nidentified and effective measures to avoid, minimize, mitigate, and compensate for adverse \nimpacts are incorporated in the environmental and social management plan. A series of public \nconsultation meetings with various stakeholders were conducted from 2016 to 2017 and the \nconcerns have been addressed by Chana Green. The institutional capacity and commitment of \nChana Green to manage the project\u2019s social and environmental impacts are deemed adequate \nand described in the environmental and social management plan. \n \n23.  The project with an installed generating capacity of 25 MW will be located in Ku subdistrict, \nChana district, Songkhla province, Southern Thailand. Chana Green, the borrower, acquired 150 \nrais (24 hectares) of private land 2 years ago for the project. Sale deeds have been executed and \npayment  has  been  completed  based  on  negotiated  and  agreed  prices  for  the  acquired \nproperties.10 An upgrade of an existing transmission line (from 33 KV to 115 KV) by the Provincial \nElectricity Authority of Thailand will be required for the project. However, no land acquisition is \nnecessary  as  the  existing  transmission  line  right-of-way  will  be  used.  No  properties  or \nimprovements will be impacted during transmission line upgrading. There are no indigenous \npeoples at the project site. \n \n24.  During construction, an estimated 300 workers will be engaged, mainly as skilled and \nunskilled laborers. Chana Green will comply with national labor laws and, in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Social Protection Strategy (2001), will take measures to comply with the internationally \nrecognized core labor standards.11 Chana Green will report regularly to ADB on (i) its (and its \ncontractors\u2019) compliance with such laws, and (ii) the measures taken by the company to safeguard \nthe project. Information disclosure and consultation with affected people will be conducted in \naccordance with ADB requirements. The project is categorized as having no gender element, \ngiven the limited potential for gender-inclusive design of the project. Stakeholders, including \ncommunities in the vicinity of the project, were informed and consulted about the project. The \ninitial environmental examination includes a grievance redress mechanism to receive complaints \nand facilitate their resolution. \n \nB.  Anticorruption Policy \n25.  Chana Green was advised of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption policy (1998, as amended to date). \nADB will ensure that the investment documentation includes appropriate provisions prohibiting \n                                                \n10 Rai is a unit of area, commonly used in Thailand, and is equal to 1,600 square meters. \n11 ADB. 2003.
