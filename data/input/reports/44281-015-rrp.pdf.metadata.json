The  development  objectives  set  out  in  the  Kiribati  Development  Plan  (KDP) \n2012\u20132015  are  economic  growth  and  poverty  reduction,  along  with  creating  a  sustainable \nenvironment, and better governance and infrastructure.3 The country operations business plan, \n2016\u20132018 of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for Kiribati,4 ADB\u2019s Interim Pacific Approach, \n2015, 5 and  ADB\u2019s  Midterm  Review  of  Strategy  2020  align  with  the  KDP. 6  Fragmented  and \nineffective governance arrangements have contributed to the deterioration of the road network \nin  Kiribati\u2019s  capital,  South  Tarawa.  The  Ministry  of  Public  Works  and  Utilities  (MPWU)  is \nresponsible  for  road  maintenance,  but  receives  an  overall  annual  maintenance  appropriation \nthat includes other activities and is insufficient. \n \nThe current project is cofinanced by ADB, the World Bank, the Government of Australia \n4. \nthrough  the  Pacific  Regional  Infrastructure  Facility  (PRIF),  and  the  Government  of  Kiribati  to \nrehabilitate  and  upgrade  32.5  kilometers  (km)  of  paved  road  and  8  km  of  unpaved  road. \nDevelopment coordination between the cofinanciers and the government is strong. The current \nproject  cofinancing  stands  at  $57.45  million.  ADB  approved  a  loan  in  the  amount  of \nSDR7,621,000 ($12 million) on 20 December 2010 (footnote 2). The ADB loan agreement was \nsigned on 17 March 2011 and became effective on 26 August 2011. The World Bank approved \na grant of $20 million, and PRIF one of $5.79 million, on 1 March 2011.7 The World Bank grant \nagreement  was  signed  on  5  May  2011  and  the  PRIF  grant  agreement  on  30  May  2011.  In \nMarch 2015, the World Bank provided additional financing of $6.97 million, and PRIF provided \nan  extra  $7  million.  Meanwhile,  the  government\u2019s  contribution  increased  from  $1.05  million  to \n$5.69 million  for  the  civil  works  contract.  As  of  March  2015,  the  overall  additional  financing \namounted to $18.61 million. The impact, outputs, and outcomes are indicated in paras. 11\u201312. \n \n5. \nThe  current  project  incurred  initial  delays  that  have  been  managed.  The  delays  were \nattributed to significant capacity constraints within the executing agency (the Ministry of Finance \nand  Economic  Development  [MFED]  and  the  implementing  agency  (MPWU).  This  led  to \nimprovements by the executing agency and implementing agency, such as the establishment of \n\n                                                 \n1  The revised design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  ADB.  2010.

Manila. \n7  Increased from $16 million and $4.61 million, respectively, to account for the inclusion of an additional 5 kilometers \n\n(km) of paved road and 2 km of unpaved road. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nrecruited  an \n\ntechnical  advisor \n\ninternational  project \n\nthe Kiribati Fiduciary Services Unit (KFSU) within the executing agency. The unit is staffed with \na qualified financial manager, project accountants, and a procurement officer, and supported by \ninternational  procurement  and  financial  consultants  financed  by  development  partners  to \nprovide  direct  support  to  project  financial  management,  procurement,  and  administration.  The \nto  support \nimplementing  agency \nimplementation  and  ensure  adequate  project  monitoring  and  evaluation.  The  project  steering \ncommittee meets regularly to review the project budget and deal with implementation issues. \n \nIn  addition,  the  civil  works  contractor  experienced  various  start-up  difficulties.  For  one, \n6. \nthe  supply  of  material  for  the  base  course  and  of  local  (coral)  material  was  insufficient  or \nnonexistent because the local dredging enterprise was late procuring its resources. Second, the \nasphalt  plant  was  due  to  be  mobilized  in  August  2013,  but  this  was  delayed  because  the \nsubcontractor went into receivership. Third, the Betio causeway and revetment were damaged \nduring  the  extreme  spring  tides  in  January\u2013March  2014\u2014the  revetment  shows  significant \ndeterioration  and  is  understood  to  be  past  its  design  life.  Fourth,  the  contractor  found \nundocumented underground installations (power, water, telecommunications) during earthworks. \nFour  major  high-voltage  cable  strikes  escalated  the  issue  to  a  serious  health  and  safety  risk. \nThe first problem was solved when additional resources became available to the local dredging \nenterprise, and separate contractual arrangements were made between the enterprise and the \ncontractor  for  excavating  a  barge  access  channel  so  that  locally  supplied  aggregate  would  be \navailable.  The  problem  with  the  asphalt  plant  was  solved  when  the  contractor  purchased  the \nplant, and the equipment for batching and asphalt laying, and made it operational in April 2014. \nAs for the Betio causeway problem, the contractor was instructed to defer pavement works and \nto  reprogram  the  overall  works  accordingly.  The  deferred  works  were  later  deleted  from  the \ncontract,  although  0.4  km  had  been  paved  and  minor  repairs  along  the  causeway  had  been \ncarried  out.  The  fourth  problem  was  resolved  by  employing  an  electrical  resource  team,  and \nhealth  and  safety  procedures,  to  ensure  a  safe  working  environment  during  preconstruction \nclearance.  Underground  service  installations  remain  a  serious  risk,  but  the  measures  taken \nensure that works proceed safely under a revised program. \n \n7. \n\nThe current project is performing well so far:8 \n(i) \n\nDelivery of expected outputs. The project will have three outputs as follows: \n(a) \n\nOutput  1:  The  project  intends  to  rehabilitate  and  upgrade  32.5  km  of \npaved  roads  and  8.0  km  of  unpaved  feeder  roads.  Good  progress  has \nbeen  made  in  completing  about  13.1  km  of  paved  roads  and  3.0  km  of \nfeeder  roads  so  far.  As  at  the  end  of  August  2015,  physical  progress  of \nthe  civil  works  stands  at  56%  completed  against  89%  of  time  elapsed. \nThe  following  activities  were  completed:  coastal  protection  and  paving \nalong  1.9 km  of  the  airport  road,  11.2 km  of  asphalt  paving  on  the  main \nroad, 16.0 km of kerbing, and 4.5 km of U-drains. Given the failure of the \narmoring  of  the  Betio  causeway,  and  the  need  for  the  causeway  to \nundergo  major  rehabilitation,  the  pavement  works  for  it  (2.8  km)  were \nremoved  from  the  contract. 9  Overall,  40%  of  surfacing  and  pavement \nworks  are  completed,  and  ancillary  activities  such  as  footpaths,  speed \nhumps,  street  lighting  and  road  signage  are  ongoing.  The  road  sector \nreforms  are  also  progressing  well  with  the  completion  of  the  road  safety \n\n                                                 \n8  ADB. 2010.

Manila( Para. 3). \n\n9  The government held discussions with the Government of Japan to fund the Betio causeway redevelopment at a \ncost of about A$30 million. The contractor paved 0.4 km of the Betio causeway and did minor repairs to keep the \nlength of the causeway accessible. The contractor is scheduled to do repair works to the bridge deck. \n\n\f(b) \n\n(c) \n\ntraffic \n\nreview  of \n\nlegislation,  and  community-based \naction  plan, \nmicroenterprise  initiatives  to  continue  maintenance  after  the  project  is \ncompleted. \nOutput 2: The contractor has employed microenterprise teams to perform  \nroutine  road  maintenance.  The  teams  have  had  training  and  received \nmanuals.  It  is  expected  that  at  least  three  teams  will  be  formally \nestablished  by  2016,  during  the  defects  liability  period.  The  MPWU\u2019s \ncurrent  level  of  maintenance  expenditure  for  resourcing  should  ensure \ncontinuous formation of microenterprises. \nOutput 3: The MPWU recruited a technical advisor to ensure efficient  \nproject \nthe  KFSU  ensures  project \nIn  addition, \ncoordination and fiduciary and procurement support. Works are expected \nto  remain  on  track,  and  essentially  all  physical  works  are  planned  to  be \ncompleted by March 2016. \n\nimplementation. \n\nSatisfactory  implementation  progress.  Procurement  contracts  were  awarded \nand are being implemented. The World Bank administers the ongoing civil works \ncontract,  which  is  funded  jointly  by  the  cofinanciers.  ADB  fully  administers  and \nfinances  the  contract  of  the  design  and  supervision  consultant.  Overall  contract \nadministration is carried out routinely and monitored during administration review \nmissions.  The  contract  for  the  design  and  supervision  consultant  was  awarded \non 2 December 2010 for $2.15 million. As of September 2015, the total contract \namount is $4.43 million because of variations related to additional design inputs, \nadditional staff inputs for construction supervision, and environmental monitoring. \nThe contract for civil works was awarded on 12 February 2012 for A$48.2 million \n(equivalent  to  $50.1  million).  ADB\u2019s  original  contract  to  support  the  overall \nfinancing was $7.59 million; this was revised in May 2015 to $5.09 million when a \nreallocation  was  required  to  ensure  sufficient  funds  for  any  further  increases  in \nconsulting  costs  (financed  100%  by  ADB).  ADB\u2019s  loan  disbursements  currently \nstand at 74% ($8.33 million). \nSatisfactory  compliance  with  safeguard  policy  requirements.  Compliance \nwith  the  World  Bank\u2019s,  ADB\u2019s  and  national  safeguard  policy  requirements  and \nplans is satisfactory, and no major issues have arisen to date.10 The Ministry for \nEnvironment,  Land  and  Agriculture  Development  issued  the  environmental \nlicense  for  civil  works  in  November  2012,  and  the  project\u2019s  environmental \nmanagement  plan  (EMP),  based  on \ninitial  environmental \nexamination,  is  routinely  updated  and  disclosed,  last  in  October  2014.  The \ncontractor  also  has  a  contractor\u2019s  EMP  (revision  N)  that  is  used  to  monitor \ncompliance.  Environmental  monitoring  reports  are  regularly  submitted  and \ndisclosed.  The  contractor  also  has  manuals  and  plans  covering  occupational \nhealth  and  safety,  quality  assurance, \ntraffic  management,  and  general \nconstruction  techniques.  The  contractor\u2019s  health  and  safety  performance  was \nfound to be best practice. The contractor also engaged the Kiribati Family Health \nAssociation  to  conduct  an  HIV/AIDS  education  campaign  for  its  employees. \nResettlement monitoring reports were provided and indicated no major issues.  \nSuccessful management of risks. The project has managed and mitigated the \nrisks identified during processing and implementation to date. As such, no major \n\nthe  approved \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n                                                 \n10 In  practice,  the  cofinanciers  entered  into  a  Memorandum  of  Understanding  dated  5  March  2012  which  provides \nguidance on the cofinanciers cooperation, coordination and sharing of information in particular with the reviewing of \nprocurement  processes,  as  well  as  safeguard  requirements  to  ensure  mutual  agreement  on  project-related \nmatters. \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\nrisks  threaten  the  successful  implementation  of  the  project.  Nonetheless,  given \nthe  project\u2019s  size  and  complexity  for  a  small  country,  and  the  number  of  other \nlarge  infrastructure  investments  being  undertaken  concurrently,  risks  are  still \nconsidered  high.  The  health  and  safety  concerns  that  arose  after  striking \nunderground  cables,  which  led  to  the  suspension  of  works  from  27  February \n2015  to  20  April  2015,  were  dealt  with  adequately  by  adopting  stringent  safety \nprocedures and mobilizing an electrical resource team to ensure a safe working \nenvironment. Risks are further reviewed during administration review missions. \nOn track rating. The project is rated as on track and has performed consistently \nwell since November 2014. \n\n(v) \n\n \n8. \nThe  request  for  additional  financing  is  a  consequence  of  an  underestimation  of  costs, \ndelays  and  other  implementation  issues,  inflation  in  costs  of  materials,  exchange  rate \nfluctuations, and increased transportation costs. The cost estimate for civil works at appraisal of \nthe  current  project  was  $29.5  million.  Four  bidders  responded  with  bid  prices  ranging  from \nA$49.6 million  (equivalent  to  $51.9  million)  to  A$64.5  million  (equivalent  to  $67.5  million),  or \n17%\u201336% above the engineers\u2019 estimate. The minimum bid price was A$15.2 million over the \ncost estimate. Of the components the project estimate was lowest for only the cost categories \nfor  works  required  for  general  ($10  million),  pavement  ($6.6  million)  and  water  ($0.9  million). \nThe possible causes of the deviation from cost estimate to final contract price were analyzed as \nfollows:  (i)  $9.53  million  resulting  from  fluctuations  in  the  US$\u2013A$  exchange  rate  and  inflation \nsince cost estimation in 2010; and (ii) $7.46 million arising from additional works needed but not \nbudgeted at the time of appraisal;11 and (iii) $3.76 million stemming from the civil works\u2019 general \ncosts  because  of  remoteness.  The  preparation  of  cost  estimates  was  higher  than  budget \nprovisions. The underestimation was caused by the lack of historical precedent for a project of \nthis magnitude in Kiribati, which holds a lesson for future cost estimations. Due to the absence \nof data, the estimate relied on developing unit rates and costs from principles using basic costs \nof  materials,  equipment  and  labour.  Comparisons  with  recent  similar  projects  in  the  Pacific \nregion  showed  the  project  cost  to  be  an  outlier.  This  is  indicative  of  the  high  risks  that  the \nmarket placed on the remote and inaccessible country, and the arduousness of the work site. A \ncomparative  analysis  of  the  4  bids  showed  there  was  reasonable  consistency  in  the  rates \noffered,  and  the  rates  of  the  lowest  evaluated  bid  was  considered  to  be  acceptable.  On  the \nbasis of the assessment the unit rates and prices offered by the bidders were reasonable and \nreflected the true competitive market price. \n \n9. \nThe  civil  works  contract  awarded  on  12  February  2013  was  for  A$48.2  million \n(equivalent  to  $50.1 million).12 The funding gap  of $21  million  was  identified  in  late  2012  upon \ncompletion  of  the  civil  works  bidding.  The  project\u2019s  budget  at  the  time  of  $34.44  million  had \nallocated  an  indicative  $29.1  million  (inclusive  of  $3.8  million  in  contingencies)  to  civil  works. \nCurrently, the financing gap for the civil  works contract is about $2.40 million. In addition, cost \noverruns total about A$7.55 million (equivalent to $5.35 million). The consulting engineers have \nprepared  the  assessment  taking  into  account  costs  to  completion,  such  as  the  actual  and \npotential  contract  variations,  claims,  currency  fluctuations,  and  extension  of  time.  The  cost \n\n                                                 \n11 On  31  January  2011,  the  regional  director  of  ADB\u2019s  Pacific  Subregional  Office  approved  the  change  in  project \nscope that increased the length of the main road by about 5 km from Tanea to Buota, and the Temaiku loop road; \nupgrading of an extra 2 km of feeder roads; and the replacement of about 7 km of water supply transmission main \nbetween Teaoraereke and Betio. \n\n12 The bid was denominated 13.00% in Australian dollars, 81.41% in New Zealand dollars, and 5.58% in US dollars. \nThe  contract  was  signed  on  12  February  2013  and  the  start  date  was  1  July  2013.  The  procurement  contract \nsummary  sheet created  at  the  time  of contract  award  was  for  $7.59 million,  to  align  with  ADB\u2019s  allocation  of  the \nloan proceeds. \n\n\fImpact and Outcome \n\noverruns and the financing gap need to be dealt with to allow the project to be completed and to \nensure  that  the  project  development  objectives  are  met.  The  ADB  grant  of  $2.4  million  in \nadditional finance will fill in the shortfall. \n \nThe  current  project  meets  all  eligibility  criteria  for  additional  financing  because  (i)  it \n10. \nremains  technically  feasible,  economically  viable,  and  financially  sound;  (ii)  the  government \nincludes  the  investment  as  a  high  priority  in  the  KDP;  (iii)  it  is  consistent  with  the  current \nproject\u2019s development objectives; and (iv) it is consistent with ADB\u2019s current country partnership \nstrategy.13 The  current  project  has  faced  significant  challenges,  but  did  not  require  any  major \nchange  in  the  design  and  implementation  arrangements.  The  design  and  implementation \nproblems  were  fully  and  satisfactorily  solved,  and  the  current  project  performance  has  been \nrated  on  track  since  November  2014.

Project  preparation \nincluded  a  comprehensive  road  safety  audit  of  all  of  South  Tarawa\u2019s  roads,  and  the \nrecommendations have informed the detailed engineering design.16 An initial key challenge was \nthe scarcity of local material for road construction. During project preparation, it was anticipated \nthe  European  Union-funded \nthat \nEnvironmentally  Sustainable  Aggregate  Tarawa  Project  and \nimporting  processed \naggregates.17 Local coral material was made available by excavating new channels through the \nlocal  commercial  dredging  company,  and  from  the  borrow  pits  of  the  implementing  agency\u2019s \nplant vehicles unit. \n\nlocally  required  materials  would  be  sourced \n\nfrom \n\nfrom \n\nThe  road  runs  near  the  edge  of  the  lagoon  for  most  of  its  length.  A  rise  in  sea  level, \n17. \nextreme annual cycles of spring tides, and increased erosion are the most significant threats to \nits sustainability. Coastal protection works, including wave energy modeling, are ongoing under \nphase  3  of  the  World  Bank-financed  Kiribati  Adaptation  Project. 18  The  government  also \n                                                 \n16 World Bank. 2010. Report of the Road Safety Audit on Tarawa, Republic of Kiribati. Sydney. \n17 The European Union funded Environmentally Sustainable Aggregate Tarawa project provides an alternative supply   \n    of  construction  aggregate  from  the  lagoon  basin.  The  project  aims  to  meet  South  Tarawa\u2019s  rapidly  growing  \n\naggregate demand while reducing pressure on beach mining. \n\n18 Phases  1  and  2  of  the  Kiribati  Adaptation  Project  were  implemented  by  the  World  Bank  and  supported  by  the \nWorld Bank, the Global Environmental Facility, the Government of Australia, the New Zealand Aid Programme, the \nJapan  Policy  and  Human  Resources  Development  Climate  Change  Fund,  and  the  United  Nations  Development \nProgramme. A parallel project by the European Union also involves coastal protection work. \n\n \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\fEconomic and Financial \n\nrequested  the  World  Bank,  as  a  Green  Climate  Fund-accredited  entity,  to  prepare  a  detailed \ncoastal  protection  program  for  potential  funding  from  the  Green  Climate  Fund.  The  drainage \ndesign  has  taken  into  account  the  possible  risk  posed  by  heavier  rainfall  in  future  years. \nBecause  some  future  climate  scenarios  also  forecast  longer  and  more  intense  droughts,  the \nproject has considered directing runoff to soak pits to increase groundwater. \n \nB. \n \nThe project\u2019s economic viability  was reevaluated on the basis of higher cost estimates. \n18. \nAlthough higher costs have reduced the overall economic internal rate of return (EIRR) to 28.6% \n(from 40.3% in the original appraisal),19 the project remains economically viable.20 As expected, \nthe largest reductions in EIRR correspond to sections that involve the largest unit cost inflation \nrate,  i.e.,  St.  Anne\u2013airport  intersection  and  Airport  Road.  In  contrast,  higher  EIRRs  are  now \nexpected from expansions in scale for sections of Temaiku Road (from 2.9 km to 6.1 km) and \nfeeder roads (from 6.0 km to 6.9 km, at slightly lower unit costs). Each remaining project section \nhas  an  individual  EIRR  well  above  the  standard  benchmark  of  12%,  and  robust  EIRRs  are \nmaintained even under various adverse scenarios considered in sensitivity analyses. High rates \nof return largely reflect heavy demand from traffic of up to 6,000 vehicles per day on the existing \nroad  system,  and  the  benefits  of  rehabilitation  from  the  current  poor  condition.  Unquantified \nbenefits\u2014e.g.,  road  safety  improvements,  which  tend  to  generate  rates  of  return  even  greater \nthan  those  for  rehabilitation,  and  potential  decongestion  on  Temaiku  Road,  which  provides \naccess  to  the  only  remaining  uninhabited  state  land  in  densely  populated  South  Tarawa\u2014\nfurther bolster the economic viability of the project. \n \nThe project roads are non-revenue-earning, operated by MWPU\u2014a noncommercial unit \n19. \nthat receives annual allocations for operation and maintenance of infrastructure assets. Recent \nand  ongoing  public  sector  management  and  public  financial  management  reforms  are \nrefocusing  scarce  resources  toward  funding  of  essential  government  functions  and  services, \nincluding infrastructure operation and maintenance. These would therefore facilitate consistently \nadequate allocations to MWPU for periodic road maintenance. Government allocations are likely \nto be funded through the Revenue Equalization Reserve Fund, which should ensure adequate \noperation and maintenance funding and the sustainability of infrastructure assets. \n \nC. \n \n20. \nFinancial  management. A public expenditure and financial accountability assessment, \nconducted in Kiribati in 2010, indicated that public financial management is weakened by a lack \nof  fiscal  discipline,  nonretirement  of  advances,  lack  of  financial  reconciliation  between  MFED \nand  the  line  ministries,  lack  of  effective  expenditure  commitment  controls,  and  outdated \nlegislation  and  regulations.21 Since  then,  development  partners,  including  ADB,  have  assisted \nthe government in designing and implementing the Kiribati Public Financial Management Plan, \n2011\u20132014.22 Improvements in public financial management have been noted, and plans are in \nplace to update the public expenditure and financial accountability assessment in 2015. \n \nThe  financial  management  arrangements  for  the  current  project  will  continue  for  the \n21. \nadditional  financing.

MFED  will  continue  to  be  responsible  for  the  overall  financial \nmanagement  of  the  project.  A  full-time  qualified  project  accountant  is  continuing  to  handle  all \nfinancial  management  activities.  The  project  is  continuing  to  use  direct  payment  disbursement \nprocedure, and all required audits will be carried out. For the current project, no audited project \nfinancial statements are overdue, or financial management issues pending. Of the three audited \nproject financial statements received, two were submitted early and one was submitted after the \ndeadline. All audit reports were issued with unqualified opinions. \n \nD. \n \n22. \nThe project will directly benefit the entire population of South Tarawa, for whom the road \nis  a  vital  shared  communal  asset.  As  the  lone  vehicular  transport  route  on  the  atoll,  the  road \nprovides  access  to  the  airport,  the  port,  local  wharves,  markets,  churches,  nongovernment \norganizations,  businesses,  as  well  as  government,  education,  and  health  services.  It  sustains \neconomic development, links communities, and is also the main thoroughfare for pedestrians. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\nPrivate car owners, bus and truck operators, freight handlers, retailers and wholesalers, \n23. \nutility  providers,  public \ntransport  users,  motorcyclists,  cyclists,  pedestrians,  residents, \nbusinesses, and the government will all benefit directly from the project. It will reduce roadside \ndust,  thereby  improving  air  quality,  leaving  homes,  shops,  and  vehicles  cleaner,  and  reduce \ndamage to equipment. New footpaths will improve pedestrian safety and cut back reliance and \nspending on vehicle transport.  \n\nThe port area of Betio, which the project road serves, is the site of a prostitution industry \n24. \nthat  presents  the  risk  of  HIV/AIDS  transmission.  While  the  current  HIV/AIDS  rate  in  South \nTarawa is reported to be low, the port is a hub for international fishing vessels and an estimated \n30%  of the  sexually  active  population  has  a  sexually  transmitted  infection. There  is  a risk that \ninfection rates will increase. The current project diligently carries out the HIV/AIDS information \nand  education  campaign  for  the  contractor\u2019s  employees,  subcontractors,  consultants,  and \ncommunities  near  the  project  site.  The  Kiribati  Country  Coordinating  Mechanism  has  been \nestablished by the government to coordinate HIV/AIDS activities, including voluntary counseling \nand  testing  facilities.  The  civil  works  contractor  has  subcontracted  the  Kiribati  Family  Health \nAssociation to deliver the HIV/AIDS information and education campaign. \n\n \nSafeguards \n\nE. \n \n25. \nEnvironment.  The  current  project  is  classified  as  category  B,  and  the  EMP  prepared \nwas  updated  to  reflect  ongoing  impacts.  The  project  is  currently  operating  under  the  revised \nversion  5  of  the  EMP  approved  in  October  2014.  The  resulting  contractor\u2019s  EMP  (revision  N) \nwas accepted in August 2015. The main potential impacts are (i) disturbance from dust arising \nfrom loading, unloading, and transportation of construction materials; (ii) noise; (iii) erosion and \nsedimentation  from  exposed  surfaces  during  construction,  which  may  affect  the  lagoon \nenvironment; (iv) risks from the use and disposal of hazardous materials such as used fuel and \nlubricants;  and  (v)  greater  risk  of  accidents  from  more  vehicle  movements.  Detailed  mitigation \nmeasures were incorporated in the project, as outlined in the EMP. An international environment \nspecialist  and  a  national  environment  inspector  are  engaged  during  the  construction  phase  to \nensure  compliance  monitoring  of  the  EMP  and  reporting  to  the  Ministry  of  Environment,  Land \nand  Agriculture  Development.  The  environmental  classification  for  the  additional  financing  is \ncategorized as C since the project will cover cost overruns and not involve a change in scope. \n \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\nInvoluntary resettlement. The project is classified as category B, and the resettlement \n26. \nplan  has  been  updated  to  reflect  anticipated  impacts  and  provide  guidelines  for  any \nunanticipated impacts. The additional financing is categorized as C since no buildings are to be \nrelocated  and  no  economic  crops  are  affected  under  this  project.  To  the  extent  possible,  the \nroads  to  be  rehabilitated  will  follow  the  current  road  alignment,  and  any  resettlement  or \ncompensation for economic loss will be undertaken in accordance with the updated resettlement \nplan.  To  date,  compensation  for  loss  of  land  and  assets,  mainly  for  loss  of  fruit-bearing  trees, \nhas  been  paid  to  97%  of  affected  persons\u2014327  in  total.  An  escrow  account  has  been \nestablished  for  compensation  of  the  remaining  13  affected  persons  as  soon  as  the  pending \ncourt cases are resolved and affected persons are traced. \n \n27. \nIndigenous people. The project is classified as category C for indigenous peoples. The \ninhabitants of South Tarawa are from a single ethnic group. No customary, cultural, economic, \nsocial, or political institutions set South Tarawa apart from the rest of Kiribati\u2019s society. \n \nF. \n \n28.  Major risks and mitigating measures are described in detail in the risk assessment and \nrisk  management  plan.23 Overall,  the  risks  are  being  managed  and  mitigated  under  improved \nproject  implementation  arrangements,  in  particular  the  establishment  of  the  KFSU  and  the \nengagement  of  a  technical  advisor.  The  integrated  benefits  and  impacts  are  expected  to \noutweigh  the  costs.  The  overall  sustainability  of  the  project  is  being  bolstered  by  institutional \nreforms  of  the  road  subsector,  revisions  to  the  existing  traffic  laws,  and  adequate  budgetary \nallocations to meet road maintenance requirements through community-based microenterprises. \n \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n \n29. \nThe government has assured ADB that implementation of the project shall conform to all \napplicable  ADB  policies,  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures,  safeguards, \ngender, procurement, consulting services,
