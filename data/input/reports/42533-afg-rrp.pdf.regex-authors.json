The Project represents a first phase \nof a larger rail network planned across the north and other parts of \nthe country, including links to Herat, Tajikistan, and Pakistan. It will \nexpand the existing transport network in Afghanistan and improve \nsubstantially internal and international connectivity. The Project is \npart of the Transport Strategy and Action Plan agreed under the \nCentral Asia Regional Economic Cooperation (CAREC) Program. It \nwill add capacity to two transport corridors under CAREC and open \nup alternative routes of supply for national and international trade, as \nwell as for humanitarian relief to Afghanistan. \n \nThe  Project  has  two  components:  (i)  design  and  construction  of \n75  km  single-line  railway  and  associated  infrastructure;  and \n(ii) project management, independent supervision, and institutional \nsupport. The Project will be executed through a fixed price and fixed \ntime  delivery  engineering,  procurement,  and  construction  (EPC) \nturnkey contract. Once constructed, tested, and commissioned, the \nrail service will be managed by an operator under an operation and \nmaintenance contract. \n \nRationale  The  Project  has  strong  rationale.  First,  it  will  develop  a  reliable, \nefficient, safe, and sustainable transport link within the country and \nbetween the country and its neighbors. Hairatan already doubles up \nas Afghanistan's most important dry and river port, acting as the \ngateway  for  almost  half  of  Afghanistan's  total  imports.  Key \ncommodities and goods moving through this point include oil and \nfuel,  wheat  and  flour,  fertilizer,  construction  materials  such  as \ncement and bitumen, agricultural and off-highway equipment and \nconsumer goods. Hairatan is also a largest port for the supply of \nhumanitarian relief to Afghanistan. However, the existing transport \ninfrastructure  and  facilities  at  Hairatan  cannot  cope  with  an \nexpanding volume of trade and humanitarian relief. An existing rail \nline between Termez in Uzbekistan and Hairatan does not have a rail \nlink into Afghanistan. Freight  destined  for  Afghanistan  and  beyond \n   ", "ii   \n  has to be off-loaded and reloaded into trucks at this border. This is \nboth slow and extremely costly. Moreover, other established trade \nand supply routes servicing Afghanistan are disrupted because of \nsecurity  constraints.  The  Termez\u2013Hairatan  railway  line  helps  but \nAfghanistan and other Central Asian countries would benefit if this \nwere  to  be  extended  into  Mazar-e-Sharif  \u2013  ending  at  the  airport \nthere,  which  is  being  expanded  with  German  assistance,  and \nconnecting  to  the  Ring  Road  being  financed  by  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB). This expanded rail line will remove major \ncritical physical bottlenecks at the border, quadrupling capacity and \nultimately aiding regional trade. \n \nA second important feature of the Project is its strong strategic and \nlogistical  content  to  countries  in  Central  Asia.  Afghanistan  is  the \nnatural transit route to reach ports in Pakistan and the Caspian, for \nthe onward sale of goods to South and East Asia, Middle East, and \nEurope. The railway line cuts bottlenecks at Hairatan, raises the \nprofile  of  Afghanistan  as  a  transit  route  and  complements  the \nconnectivity improvements arising out of the two CAREC corridors \n(3 and 6), now under construction.  \n \nThe Project fits well with the Government's development strategy \nand ADB's Country Partnership Strategy for 2009\u20132013. The latter \nflags transport as a priority area for assistance. The Project also fits \nwell with the CAREC Transport and Trade Facilitation Strategy and \nthe Action Plan. \n \nThe  Project  will  be  implemented  in  line  with  ADB's  approach  to \nengaging with weakly performing countries.  \n   \nImpact and Outcome  The Project will lead to greater economic growth and increased trade \nbetween Afghanistan and the region. The outcome will be a more \nefficient, safer, and sustainable railway transport network in northern \nAfghanistan, resulting in increased transport volumes and reduced \ntransport  costs.  The  Project  underpins  regional  cooperation  and \nintegration in Central Asia. \n   \nProject Investment Plan   The investment cost is estimated at $170 million equivalent. \n   \n  Project Investment Plan \n  ($ million) \n \nItem  Amount \n \n  1.

This will have \nArrangements  a fixed price and fixed time delivery date, with appropriate penalties \nand premiums. All technical specifications have been determined \nupfront.  These  will  guide  the  final  design  and  construction. \nAn independent consultant will oversee the EPC contract, tests and \ncommissioning and quality standards. Payments will be staggered \nand based on performance. An appropriate amount of funding will be \nretained  until  after  tests  and  commissioning.  Once  the  line  is \nconstructed,  tested,  and  accepted,  the  Government  will  sign  an \noperation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  contract  with  the  same  EPC \ngroup. This contract will also be performance based, and be subject \nto independent supervision and validation. Appropriate arrangements \nto solve disputes between the parties feature in the two contracts. \nADB will provide the required technical assistance to oversee the \nexecution of the Project, and subsequent to that, its management. \nHeadquarters and ADB Afghanistan Resident Mission staff will assist \nwith  project  implementation.  A  detailed  project  administration \nmemorandum has been prepared. \n \nThe Government will establish an executive committee to oversee \nthe work, with representatives from the ministries of finance, public \nworks,  commerce  and  industry,  transport  and  civil  aviation. \nThe executive committee will be chaired by a minister-level official. \n \nA project implementation unit will be set up in Mazar-e-Sharif. ADB \nwill consider opening an extended mission in Mazar-e-Sharif for the \npurposes of this Project, and the completion of the Ring Road.  \n \nProcurement  Procurement of civil works, goods, and services financed under the \nADB grant will be carried out in accordance with ADB Procurement \nGuidelines. The EPC contract, and later the O&M mandate, will be \nawarded to a group from a member country of ADB. However, given \nthat the railway gauge will be based on the Uzbekistan system, the \ntracks required for construction (and maintenance), will need to be \nprocured  from  countries  that  are  not  ADB  members.  The \nGovernment  therefore  requests  an  ADB  waiver  to allow for the \n ", "iv   \n  procurement of track components from nonmember countries. Due \ndiligence conducted by ADB indicates that, in this case, these track \ncomponents  can  be  more  quickly  procured  at  more  competitive \nprices from nonmember countries. \n \nIt is proposed that Uzbekistan Temir Yullari (Uzbekistan's Railway \nCompany, or UTY) be awarded two contracts: (i) an EPC contract for \ndesign and construction, and (ii) an O&M contract. \n \nDirect contracting to UTY is justified on the following grounds. First, \nthe railway line is a de facto extension of the current Uzbekistan \nrailway network into Mazar-e-Sharif. This is based on the current \nUzbekistan gauge system. Using the Uzbekistan system for this first \nphase of the rail network has considerable financial and operational \nlogic. It does not require new rolling stock and the management of \nUTY is both experienced and proven. However, this approach also \nmakes the project potentially less attractive to other contractors in \nthe region since they would be unfamiliar with the system. \n \nSecond, UTY is the only company in the region with the track record \nto  design,  procure,  and  construct  a  railway  line  based  on  the \nUzbekistan system. UTY is also the sole operator of the Uzbekistan \nrail network. UTY is familiar with conditions on the ground, first for \nconstruction and then for operations and maintenance. There are no \ncomparable operators in the region or beyond it, with the same track \nrecord. \n \nThird, UTY has already preliminary designs for the line. These are \nbased on past work commissioned directly by the Government of \nAfghanistan.  This  design  work  increases  project  readiness  and \nsaves considerable time and costs. It accelerates implementation, \nwhich in turn translates faster into fewer bottlenecks to trade.  \n \nFourth,  UTY  has  designed  and  executed  ADB-assisted  railway \nprojects in the past, including the railway link between Tashkent and \nSamarkand. The proposed Project has been given top priority by the \nmost senior authorities in Uzbekistan. It also fits with UTY's current \nproject construction pipeline. The company has sufficient financial \nresources to implement an operation of this nature, and the right \npeople and skills to manage it later.  \n \nFifth, an extension of the Uzbekistan network into Mazar-e-Sharif \nmeans Afghanistan does not have to invest or lease new rolling \nstock or spare parts. This cut costs, but only if UTY is part of the \npackage.  The  Uzbekistan  government  is  unlikely  to  want  to \noutsource  to  a  third  party  the  management  of  Uzbekistan  trains \nrunning from Hairatan to Mazar-e-Sharif. Linking the EPC contract to \nthe  operation  and  maintenance  of  the  service  saves  costs  and \nensures efficiency, yielding major financial and logistical benefits to \nall parties. \n   ", "  v\n  Sixth, ADB's experience in Afghanistan suggests that on average \nonly one company tends to bid for a construction contract. Poor \nsecurity, high costs, and other considerations account for this. This \npractice has not resulted in much competition or cost savings to \nAfghanistan.  Most  contractors  know  in  advance  the  size  of  the \nfinancing package and often submit bids close to that or even above. \nIn addition, the procurement process often takes a long time, and in \nseveral instances has involved retenders. The result has been late \nstart-ups and slow project implementation. These delays have often \nled  to  changes  in  project  scope,  cost  overruns,  and  contract \nrenegotiations. If UTY were to bid for the Project, it is likely that it \nwould be the only group doing so. On the other hand, if it were not to \nbid,  then  the  Government  would  have  to  secure  the  services  of \nanother contractor. But such contractor would effectively have to \nstart  from  scratch  with  the  design  work\u2014and  later  find  ways  to \naccess information from Uzbekistan on the gauge and operational \nsystem.  This  access  is  not  automatically  guaranteed,  putting  the \nproject  implementation  schedule  at  risk.  Finally,  a  third  party \ncontractor would not likely be able to operate Uzbekistan trains since \nthis is the exclusive mandate of UTY. \n   \nConsulting Services  The  Project  will  require  210  person-months  (110  person-months \ninternational  and  100  person-months  national  and  regional)  of \nconsulting  services.  This  comprises  (i)  about  200  person-months \n(100 person-months international and 100 person-months national \nand  regional)  from  an  international  firm  to  oversee  design  and \nconstruction  work;  and  (ii)  10  person-months  of  individual \ninternational  advisory  services  for  railway  sector,  project \nmanagement, reporting and institutional development. Consultants \nwill be selected and engaged according to ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the \nUse of Consultants and the procurement plan agreed with ADB. The \nconsulting firm will be selected using ADB\u2019s quality- and cost-based \nselection procedures and be subject to full technical proposals. \n   \nEnvironment  Category  B.  An  initial  environmental  examination  was  prepared \nAssessment  (Supplementary Appendix E) and is summarized in Supplementary \nAppendix F. \n \nProject Benefits and  The Project will expand the transport network in Afghanistan and the \nBeneficiaries   region and generate immediate benefits to freight operators, traders, \nbusinesses,  and  local  communities.  The  Project  has  some  gender \ncontent. It can create job opportunities but also reduce health risks \nassociated with current road truck operations (HIV/AIDS vectors). The \nrail  line  will  replace  some  road-based  cargo.  The  Project  will  cut \ntransport costs in the region and Afghanistan, and generate time \nsavings by unlocking current logistics and transport bottlenecks at \nthe Hairatan marshalling yard. This will increase truck productivity \nand  transport  capacity.  The  Project  will  raise  the  profile  of \nAfghanistan as a transit route, make it easier to deliver humanitarian \nrelief  and  complement  other  modes  of  transport,  including  two \nCAREC  transport   corridors and  the soon to be expanded airport at \n ", "vi   \n  Mazar-e-Sharif. The Project is financially sound and its economic \ninternal  rate  of  return  is  estimated  at  15%.  Sensitivity  tests \ndemonstrate the Project to be robust across a broad range of key \nparameter variations. \n   \nRisks and Assumptions  The Project assumes maximum coordination efforts by Government \nagencies in Afghanistan, and the full commitment and support of the \nBalkh  Provincial  government,  local  communities,  and  security \ninstitutions. Moreover, it is assumed that the Government will sustain \npolicies  conducive  to  economic  growth  and  remain  committed  to \nregional cooperation and integration.  \n \nThe  Project  has  two  major  potential  risks:  (i)  start-up  and \nimplementation  delays,  and  (ii)  security.  The  Government  plans \nstrong measures to mitigate these risks. Advance actions are being \nbeen taken to speed up implementation readiness. The engagement \nof supervision consultants is already underway and discussions have \ntaken place with UTY on basic EPC contract terms and conditions, \nincluding quality standards, the fixed price concept, and fixed time \ndelivery schedule. A request for a proposal from UTY has also been \nadvanced, a final commitment being subject to formal approvals of \nthe financing, and other arrangements, by ADB and the Government \nof Afghanistan. ADB will act throughout as a facilitator, including at \nthe negotiations between the Government and UTY, and will engage \nthe services of an independent railway expert to verify the price \nproposals by UTY. Implementation delay risks can be mitigated by \nthe EPC contract and the fact that UTY has already preliminary \ndesigns. This can reduce the risk of cost overruns and will lower the \nprobability  of  execution  extensions.  On  security,  the  Project  will \nprovide  sufficient  funds  to  mitigate  possible  security  disruptions \nduring  implementation.  Close  coordination  with  the  Ministry  of \nInterior has taken place.  \n \nActions  are  also  planned  to  mitigate  operational  risks.  A  railway \nagency will be set up during the implementation phase to manage \nthe rail assets and ensure their financial sustainability. An advisor will \nbe engaged to prepare an operation and maintenance agreement \nbetween  the  Government  and  UTY,  which  will  be  finalized  and \nsigned before Project completion. ADB will assist with this contract \nnegotiation,  including  its  operational  criteria  and  basic  terms  and \nconditions.  The  agreement  will  cover  performance  benchmarks, \nmaintenance, risk sharing, and other arrangements between the two \nparties. \n   ", "64o  00'E 72o  00'E\nTAJIKISTAN\nUZBEKISTAN\nAFGHANISTAN TURKMENISTAMNazaJOr-WeH-ZaSJiAhrNaatraifn KUNDUZTAKBHAADRAKHSHAN\nHAIRATAN TO MAZAR-E-SHARIF RAILWAY PROJECT 36 o 00'N BALKH BAGHLAN 36 o 00'N\nFARYAB\nSAMANGAN PANJSHIR\nSAR-E-PUL NURISTAN\nI R A N HERAT ABAFDGGGHHHIOSRANISTBAAMNYAWNKAPARADBRAWULKOLAKGNAAPRISKAALNABAGUNLHGMAARKNHOANRAR\nDAIKONDI PAKTIA\nGHAZNI KHOST\nUZBEKISTAN ORUZGAN\n32 o 00'N FARAH ZABOL PAKTIKA PAKISTAN 32 o 00'N\nHairatan A mir Riv er S(Ftraiertn Pdosihnitp Bridge) NIMRUZHELMAND KANDAHAR\nHAIRATAN 64o  00'E 72o  00'E\nKALDAR\nN\n0 2 4 6\nKilometers Build-Up Area\nAlignment for the National Capital\nProposed Rail Line from\n   Hairatan to Mazar-e-Sharif (near Airport) Provincial Capital\nTotal Lenght: 75 km (approx.)

THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit, for your approval, the following report and recommendation on a proposed \ngrant to the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan for the Hairatan to Mazar-e-Sharif Railway Project \n(the Project). The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.1 \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n2.  Trade.  Intraregional  trade  is  growing  but  remains  seriously  constrained  because  of \nlimited  transport  infrastructure  and  facilities.  Trade  is  increasing  between  Afghanistan  and \nPakistan, Iran, and Central Asia. Annual growth rates exceed 10%. Total trade is now valued at \n$3.5 billion, of which $500 million are exports and $3 billion imports. Volume imports exceed  \n2 million tons. Afghanistan is the crucial link for Central Asia to access South Asian markets. It \nis also a conduit to access warm-water ports in Pakistan and on the Caspian Sea for trade with \nEurope  and  the  Middle  East.  Fostering  regional  connectivity  will  help  countries  increase \ninvestment, trade, and employment. \n \n3.  Most border roads connecting Afghanistan with Uzbekistan, Iran, Pakistan, Tajikistan, \nand Turkmenistan are in bad shape. The Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation Program \n(CAREC)2 has a strategy and action plan for six transport corridors across the region and the \ndevelopment of railway networks in selected countries. These rail networks will complement the \nroad corridors and, in many instances, feed into port and airport networks. A priority railway \nnetwork under CAREC is in Afghanistan. This has three main sections: (i) Hairatan to Mazar-e-\nSharif, (ii) Mazar-e-Sharif to Herat, and (iii) Mazar-e-Sharif to Tajikistan. Later, other routes will \ninclude Chaman, border line between Pakistan and Afghanistan, to Kandahar. A railway line \nbetween Sangan in Iran and Herat is under construction with Iranian assistance. The first \nsection of the northern network will be a new railway line from Afghanistan border town of \nHairatan to Mazar-e-Sharif. This is a top Government priority and fits well with the CAREC \nTransport and Trade Facilitation Strategy and ADB's country partnership strategy for 2009\u2013\n2013.3 The sections from Mazar-e-Sharif to Herat and from Mazar-e-Sharif to Tajikistan are also \npriorities, but these are more medium term propositions as they will cost more and involve \nsignificant resettlement. These routes will become more economic once the Ring Road financed \nby the Asian Development Bank (ADB) is completed. \n \n4.  Road and railway network. Afghanistan\u2019s current transport network has roads, rail, \nairports, and inland waterways. The official road network is 38,500 kilometers (km) long, 3,300 \nkm of regional roads, 4,700 km of national roads, 9,700 km of provincial roads, 17,000 km of \nrural roads, and 3,800 km of urban roads. The total length of railways is only 25 km, being a 10 \nkm cross-border extension from Turkmenistan to a transshipment yard in Torghandi and a 15 \nkm extension from Uzbekistan to a transshipment yard in Hairatan. Hairatan is a gateway for \ncommercial goods entering and transiting Afghanistan. Hairatan accounts for about 50% of all \nimports. Hairatan is both a dry and river port. Import and transit items include oil and fuel, wheat \nand  flour,  fertilizer,  agricultural  and  other  equipment,  construction  materials  and  consumer \n                                                 \n1  Technical assistance (TA) was provided to prepare the Project.

Hairatan is also the main entry point for humanitarian relief goods. No other rail \nproject is being sponsored by a multilateral agency in Afghanistan. \n \n5.  Transport  sector  institutions.  Various  ministries  have  regulatory  and  oversight \nfunctions over transit trade and transport, including the Ministry of Commerce and Industry \n(MOCI), Customs Department under Ministry of Finance (MOF), Ministry of Transport and Civil \nAviation, Ministry of Public Works (MPW), and Ministry of Interior (MOI). Coordination among \nthe ministries is not formalized. MPW plays a principal role in the construction and maintenance \nof road and rail infrastructure. Its project management capacity is weak. \n \n6.  Land-based transport services. In 2007, the number of registered vehicles included \n300,000  cars,  40,000  buses,  100,000  trucks,  100,000  motorcycles,  and  5,000  rickshaws. \nVehicle numbers have increased rapidly in recent years, with annual growth rates over the past \n3 years close to 23% for cars, 15% for trucks, and 48% for motorcycles, but only 2% for buses \nand rickshaws. Virtually all vehicles are second-hand imports. \n \n7.  Freight is carried primarily by privately owned trucks. The truck population is based on \nheavy articulated trucks (20%), with the remaining 80% divided equally into heavy, medium, and \nlight or pickup classes. There are no special transit charges and foreign trucks transporting \nfreight through Afghanistan pay only a 5% commission. Freight rail services at Hairatan move \nabout 250 wagons a day, while at Torghandi the number is 50 wagons a day. Airport facilities \nare also limited and in a poor state of repair. Besides Kabul, Mazar-e-Sharif is the only main \nairport  due  for  major  reconstruction  and  expansion.  A  new  3,000  meter  runway  is  being \nconstructed.  About  600  meters  of  the  existing  runway  are  being  repaired,  including  new \ntaxiways. This will increase capacity for the intermodal flow of commercial goods.  \n \nB.  Key Problems and Opportunities \n8.  The  transport  sector  performance  is  affected  by  three  main  problems:  inadequate \ninfrastructure, limited government capacity, and insecurity. A transport sector assessment is in \nAppendix 2. \n \n1.  Key Problems \n9.  Inadequate  infrastructure  and  facilities.  Before  2001,  investment  in  road \nreconstruction and maintenance was negligible. This has since increased, although only 7% of \nthe total road length is paved. About 70% of inter-provincial and inter-district roads are in a poor \nstate of repair, in many cases impassable during winter months. The investment requirements \nto improve the network are high running over the long term into billions of dollars. In the medium \nterm the estimate is about $1.7 billion for 3,000 km of national roads and $1 billion for 17,000 \nkm of provincial and rural roads. The railway network is negligible. Capacity at the Hairatan \nmarshalling yard is adequate but all cargo has to be unloaded and reloaded into trucks.  \n \n10.  The road network is incomplete. Various parts of the country are poorly connected or not \nconnected at all. Four provincial capitals remain unconnected to the regional network isolating \nthem from domestic and regional markets. The coverage gap affects connectivity, which cuts \ntrade and investment opportunities, increases the cost of doing business and reduces the \ncountry\u2019s competitiveness and job creation capability. This increases costs, and generates \nlosses. \n \n11.  Regional connectivity is underdeveloped primarily due to cross-border bottlenecks. Key \nconstraints to the expansion of cross-border trade among Central and South Asian countries \n ", "      3\ninclude inadequate customs facilities and a heavy reliance on cargo transshipment at borders, \naggravated by the need for transit permits, and lack of vehicle standard and axle load controls, \nas well as visa regulations, unofficial charges, and the protection given to local trucking. Transit \nagreements  are  either  nonexistent  or  poorly  enforced.  Link  roads  and  facilities  at  border \ncrossings are inadequate. The few existing cross-border railway links have not been developed. \n \n12.  Limited Government capacity. The transport sector requires clear investment plans \nand stable and predictable financing flows. These investment plans need to distinguish better \nbetween capital and recurrent expenditures, especially for operation and maintenance (O&M). \nSeed capital is provided by donors. However, not all donors include infrastructure in their \nbusiness strategies. The result is that financing will likely remain a binding constraint for the \nforeseeable future. \n13.  MPW  has  a  weak  team  and  inadequate  project  management  skills,  systems,  and \nprocedures. It has talented staff but too few to cope with the job at hand. The skills mix is also \nweak, lacking engineers and project managers. Recruiting advisors within and outside the \ncountry is a challenge. In the meantime, the workload is increasing, particularly if all the road \nnetworks  are  taken  into  account\u2014national,  provincial,  rural,  and  city  based.  Managing \nprocurement is already a challenge. Turnkey contracts have seldom been used.  \n \n14.  Security.  Insecurity  threatens  the  reconstruction  effort,  makes  it  difficult  for  the \nGovernment to extend basic public services, increases project costs, limits bidding interest from \nconstruction companies, makes recruiting international contractors and consultants (including \nexpatriate Afghans) difficult, and erodes popular support for government staff and international \npersonnel. \n \n15.  The international connections in southern and eastern Afghanistan are currently not \nsufficiently safe or reliable. Security hinders the transportation of goods and humanitarian aid. \nThere is a need to expand all modes of transport and to open up more reliable and efficient \nroutes for trade into and from Afghanistan. A new rail line in the north will support economic \ndevelopment and poverty reduction in the country and the region. \n \n2.  Opportunities \na.  External Assistance and Lessons Learned \n16.  ADB has financed the improvement of nearly 1,100 km of regional and national roads \nsince 2004, mostly in the northern and northwestern parts of the country. ADB\u2019s investment \namounts to over $600 million. The United States Agency for International Development and the \nWorld Bank are other large players in the road sector. The European Union is financing an \nexperimental performance-based maintenance contract for a Kabul-Jalalabad road. The Japan \nBank for International Cooperation is helping MPW improve the management and use of road-\nmaintenance  equipment,  a  major  action  to  improve  institutional  effectiveness  and  project \nimplementation. \n \n17.  Three key lessons can be drawn from ADB's experience: (i) project costs have been \nunderestimated, (ii) the procurement of works and services has been slow and uncompetitive \ndespite being tendered, and (iii) stakeholder consultation has been weak. Unstable Government \ncofinancing and poor project management have been recurrent problems. \n \n18.  Most transport projects have suffered from underestimated capital and recurrent costs. \nThis problem has been exacerbated by fast-rising prices for materials and security concerns. \n ", "4   \nUnder these conditions, MPW has been unable to finance overruns, creating long delays and, in \nsome cases, actual contractual disputes. This problem has been aggravated by the approval of \nlarge stand-alone projects at a time. Financing has not always been well linked to the readiness \nof projects. The use of separate multitranche financing facilities by ADB for each priority sector \nunder the Country Partnership Strategy (footnote 3) provides an opportunity to allocate the \nannual funding envelope among projects (or sections of projects) more efficiently. Turnkey \ncontracts can also speed up contract awards, disbursements, and results on the ground. \n \n19.  Procurement of works for design-build has been done mostly on the basis of quantities \nestimated from preliminary designs. This has led to many variations in scope and scale of \nworks. The consulting firms recruited according to quality- and cost-based selection have been \nunable to replace key specialists, who often leave at short notice due to security risks. Another \ncomplication has been the lack of contractor interest. Quite often, only one contractor tends to \nbid for projects. Given that contractors know in advance the size of the financing package, bids \nhave always been close to or even higher than the finance envelope. There is a need to \nconsider increasing the number of operations structured around engineering, procurement, and \nconstruction (EPC) contracts supervised by independent and credible firms. Price verifications \ncan precede these contracts and be carried out by independent advisors. \n \n20.  Stakeholder consultation, especially with local communities, has been difficult because \nof security concerns. The result is that some communities have not bought into the projects, or \nwelcomed foreign contractors. This has become an issue affecting implementation and the \nultimate success of projects. The establishment of community funds in road and energy MFFs \nwill cover the cost of basic community infrastructure services and increase their \"buy-in\" in these \nprojects. \n \n    b.  Transport Sector Strategy \n21.  The Afghanistan National Development Strategy,4 adopted by the Government in April \n2008, is the country\u2019s main strategic platform for development over 2008\u20132020. It aims to \npromote growth, generate wealth, and cut poverty and  vulnerability. The strategy includes \ntransport  and  logistics.  In  this  regard,  it  sets  out  quantitative  and  qualitative  targets,  both \nphysical and nonphysical, and covers various systems, including roads and railways. \n \n22.  The main objective under the transport strategy is to develop corridors between Central \nAsia and South Asia. Two regional road corridors, North-South and East-West have been \nidentified and are at various stages of development. The North-South Corridor runs from Central \nAsia through Afghanistan to the Pakistani ports of Karachi/Port Qasim and Gwadar. The East-\nWest Corridor runs from Central Asia through Afghanistan to the Iranian ports of Bandar-e-\nAbbas and Chabahar. \n \n23.  Key  development  actions  are  (i)  investments  in  transport  and  trade  infrastructure;  \n(ii) strengthening trade-related institutions and improving the efficiency at ports and customs;  \n(iii) harmonizing transport, trade, and tariff policies, standards, and regulatory frameworks; and \n(iv) fostering private sector involvement. \n \n    c.  Rationale of the Project \n24.  Strategic priority.  A reliable, efficient, safe, and sustainable transport link between \nAfghanistan and its neighboring countries is essential to increase regional cooperation and \n                                                 \n4  Islamic Republic of Afghanistan. 2008. Afghanistan National Development Strategy. Kabul. \n ", "      5\ntrade. It is also a key to expanding job creation, investment, and ultimately poverty reduction in \nAfghanistan. A railway network adds to the transport modes, including the existing roads being \nbuilt in the north and center of the country, and soon to the expanded airport at Mazar-e-Sharif, \nthe country's second-largest commercial center. The extension of the railway line from Hairatan \nto Mazar-e-Sharif is a top Government priority and fits its development strategy. \n \n25.  Urgency. Due to the ongoing conflicts in Afghanistan and Pakistan, the reliability of \ntransport supply and trade routes into Afghanistan is impaired. The movement of goods by rail \nfrom the Uzbekistan border is relatively safe, and can become a cost effective transport mode. \nHairatan is already Afghanistan's main dry and river port, accounting for close to 50% of its total \nimports. But the movement of cargo is constrained by its unloading and reloading into trucks at \nthe border. This is costly, slow, and limits volume flows including humanitarian relief. Removing \nthis bottleneck is an urgent task.  \n \n26.  Efficiency.  A  new  railway  line  between  Hairatan  and  Mazar-e-Sharif  complements \nCAREC corridors 3 and 6, which connect Central Asia to South Asia, Caucasus, and the Middle \nEast. The railway targets mainly the transport of bulk and nonperishable cargo such as cotton, \ncement, and bitumen for road construction, agricultural and off-highway construction equipment, \noil and fuel, processed foods, and consumer products. The existing rail line from Termez to \nHairatan in Uzbekistan terminates at the Afghanistan border. The extension of the Termez\u2013\nHairatan  link  into  Mazar-e-Sharif  (close  to  the  airport)  can  remove  physical  constraints  at \nHairatan  and  create  an  alternative  and  competitive  transport  made  for  trade  between \nAfghanistan and its neighboring countries. Mazar-e-Sharif's location close to the Ring Road and \nthe airport results in an integrated transport facility. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n27.  The  Project  will  lead  to  greater  economic  growth  and  increase  trade  between \nAfghanistan and the region. The outcome will be a more efficient, safe, and sustainable railway \ntransport  network,  which  will  increase  transport  volumes  and  reduce  transport  costs.  The \nProject underpins regional cooperation and integration in Central Asia. \n \nB.  Outputs \n28.  The Project will build a railway line linking Hairatan and Mazar-e-Sharif. It will have two \ncomponents: (i) railway design and construction, and (ii) project management, construction \nsupervision, and institutional development. \n \n29.  Railway construction. The Project will construct a 75 km railway line and associated \nsupport infrastructure and facilities. The outputs will be:  \n \n(i)  upgraded marshaling yard and railway station at Hairatan, \n(ii)  a new single-line of 75 km,  \n(iii)  railway station and transshipment facilities at Mazar-e-Sharif, \n(iv)  signaling and telecommunication systems, and \n(v)  safety facilities. \n \n30.  The Project will benefit from recently modernized custom facilities at Hairatan, which \nhave been funded by the European Commission. The first phase of this \u20ac13 million operation is \nalready completed. The second phase will follow in 2010.  \n ", "6   \n31.  Institutional  development.  This  component  will  cover  project  management, \nconstruction supervision, and institutional support. An advisor will be recruited and tasked with \ndeveloping (i) a railway sector institutional plan, (ii) a railway legal and regulatory framework, (iii) \nan O&M agreement, and (iv) a training program. \n \nC.  Special Features \n32.  Regional cooperation. The Project will promote regional cooperation and trade. The \nfacility will attract high-value traffic on to railways, promote intermodal traffic, and encourage \nprivate sector shippers and freight forwarders to trade cargo to Afghanistan, Central Asia, South \nAsia, the Middle East, and Europe. The Project will complement CAREC road corridors.  \n \n33.  Environmental benefits. The Project will improve environmental sustainability by using \nregenerative locomotives, and better technology for noise reduction and soil erosion prevention. \nIt will use double-stack containers to increase fuel-efficiency and environmental benefits. \n \n34.  Weakly Performing Country principles. ADB\u2019s approach on Achieving Development \nEffectiveness in Weakly Performing Countries5 (WPC paper) calls for flexibility when designing \nand implementing projects. The proposal to opt for direct EPC and O&M contracting and to relax \nprocurement eligibility rules is based on these principles. \n \nD.  Project Investment Plan \n35.  The investment cost is estimated at $170 million. A summary of the investment plan is in \nTable 1.

The Government requests ADB to provide $165 million from Special Fund resources in \nthe form of a grant to finance the Project. The Government will provide $5 million to cover the \ncosts of land acquisition, resettlement, and taxes. The financing plan is in Table 2. \n \nTable 2: Financing Plan \n \nSource  Amount  \n($ million)    % \nAsian Development Bank       \n  Asian Development Fund Grant  165  97 \nGovernment of Afghanistan  5    3 \nTotal  170    100 \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nF.  Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Project Management \n37.  MPW will be the Executing Agency (EA). A project implementation unit (PIU) will be \nestablished in Mazar-e-Sharif to handle day-to-day project implementation work and will be \nresponsible  for  procurement,  fund  withdrawals,  and  reporting  to  ADB.  A  PIU  director  with \nexperience in project management and civil works will be recruited with ADB's assistance. The \nPIU director will coordinate the work of the EPC contractor and supervision consultant. MPW \nwill ensure that throughout project implementation, the PIU is adequately staffed with experts in \nengineering,  financial,  controls  procurement,  environmental,  and  social  safeguards,  and \nequipped with the necessary office space, equipment, and facilities. The organizational structure \nfor the PIU is in Appendix 4. ADB is considering opening an extended mission in Mazar-e-Sharif \nfor the purposes of this Project and the completion of the Ring Road. \n \n38.  A management information system will be used by the PIU to manage the Project. The \nPIU will prepare progress reports and submit these to the EA and ADB every quarter. It will also \nsubmit other required performance and monitoring reports twice a year. Overall progress and \ncompliance with conditions of the Grant Agreement will be monitored regularly with periodic \nreports to ADB. Reports will include the evaluation of issues or problems and remedial actions. \n \n39.  Efforts  are  needed  from  the  Government  to  accomplish  the  Project  on  time.  This \nrequires various activities within limited time and thus decisions on a fast-track basis. In order to \nadminister the Project effectively, the Government will constitute an Executive Committee, with \nrepresentatives from MOF, MPW, MOCI, and MOI. The committee will be chaired by a minister-\nlevel official. The committee will provide overall guidance, facilitate all approvals from various \nagencies, and finalize agreements with UTY. It will also firm up the O&M contract before project \ncompletion. \n \n40.  The committee will monitor and coordinate implementation with the PIU director. It will \nhandle all administrative matters to clear security and land/resettlement issues, and recruit \nadvisors. ADB will provide technical assistance to oversee the execution of the Project, and \nsubsequent to that, its management. ADB staff including in Afghanistan Resident Mission, will \nassist in project implementation. A project administration memorandum has been prepared. \n ", "8   \n2.  Implementation Period \n41.  The  Project  will  be  implemented  over  a  period  of  18  months  including  testing, \ncommissioning, and trial operations. The design and construction activities are expected to start \nin November 2009. The tentative implementation schedule is in Appendix 5. \n \n3.  Procurement \n42.  Procurement Mode. The Project will use direct contracting method based on a turnkey \ncontract covering engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC). The proposed contractor \nis Uzbekistan Temir Yullari (Uzbekistan Railways Company, or UTY). \n \n43.  Direct contracting method for procuring the EPC turnkey contract directly from UTY is \nconsistent with ADB's Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time) and is \njustified on the following grounds: \n \n(i)  The line is a de facto extension of the current Uzbekistan network into Mazar-e-\nSharif and will be based on the Uzbekistan gauge system. This approach has \nconsiderable  financial  and  operational  logic,  and  it  does  make  the  Project \npotentially less attractive to other contractors in the region unfamiliar with the \nsystem.  \n \n(ii)  There are no comparable operators in the region or beyond it, with the same \nlevel of experience as UTY when it comes to designing, building, and operating a \nrailway line based on the Uzbekistan system, including its maintenance. UTY has \nmany years of experience in the field and is familiar not only with the system but \nalso with building and operating conditions on the ground. \n \n(iii)  UTY has already proprietary preliminary designs for the Project based on past \nwork commissioned directly by the Afghanistan Government. This design work \naccelerates Project readiness, saving considerable time and costs. \n \n(iv)  UTY will also operate the railway services and maintain the track and service \nthrough a separate O&M agreement. An extension of the Uzbekistan network \ninto Mazar-e-Sharif means that Afghanistan does not have to invest or lease new \nrolling  stock  or  spare  parts.  This  cuts  down  investment  and  operation  and \nmaintenance  costs\u2014but  only  if  UTY  is  part  of  the  package  as  the \noperator/concessionaire.  Uzbekistan  would  be  unwilling  to  outsource  such \nservice to a third party.   \n \n(v)  ADB's experience in Afghanistan suggests that on average, only one company \nbids for a construction contract. Security, cost, and other considerations account \nfor this. The situation has not resulted in greater competition or cost savings to \nAfghanistan. Most contractors know in advance the size of the financing package \nand often submit bids close to that or even above. In addition, the process takes \ntime and in several instances involves re-bidding. The end-result has been late \nstart-ups and slow project implementation. These delays have caused changes \nin project scope, cost overruns, and contract renegotiations. Further, if UTY were \nto bid for the Project, it would likely be the only group doing so. If it were not to \nbid, the Government would have to secure the services of another contractor that \nwould effectively have to start from scratch with the design work and find ways to \naccess information from Uzbekistan on its gauge and operational system. This \n ", "      9\naccess is not guaranteed, putting the Project implementation schedule at risk, \nleading  to  substantial  delays  and  price  increases.  Opting  for  international \nstandards is an option. But this implies then having to buy or lease rolling stock \ninternationally.  Finally,  a  third-party  contractor  would  not  be  able  to  operate \nUzbekistan trains. UTY has this mandate on an exclusive basis. \n \n44.  Linking an EPC turnkey contract to O&M is another strong feature of the Project. This \nyields major logistical benefits to all parties. The Government and ADB will oversee design, \nconstruction, and commissioning through the independent supervision consultancy.  \n \n45.  Source  of  materials.  The  Project  will  adopt  the  Uzbekistan  gauge  standard  for \nefficiency and economic reasons. The rail tracks are produced by countries adopting this gauge \nstandard.  A  number  of  them  are  not  ADB-member  countries.  ADB  procurement  eligibility \nrestrictions would effectively preclude UTY from seeking the best business terms from suppliers \nin these countries, and thus from submitting a competitive proposal. The Government requests \nADB to waive the eligibility rule to allow financing of the rail track components procured from \nnonmember countries of ADB. Due diligence work conducted by ADB indicates that, in this \ncase, procurement of rail track components could be quicker and more competitive. Considering \nthe flexibility allowed in the WPC paper (footnote 5), it is proposed that UTY be allowed to \nprocure rail track components from countries that are not ADB members. \n \n46.  UTY  qualifications. UTY is the sole operator of the Uzbekistan rail network which \nextends up to the border town of Hairatan. UTY has designed and executed ADB rail projects in \nthe past, including the railway link between Tashkent and Samarkand.6 The company has \nadequate expertise and sufficient financial resources to support a project of this nature. UTY is \noperating and maintaining the existing railway line between Termez and Hairatan, including the \nHairatan station and marshalling yard. In addition, the following summarizes UTY's capacity: \n \n(i)  UTY is supported by two specialized railway design institutions and is able to \ndevelop  complex  detailed  designs  for  construction  of  new  railway  lines  and \nassociated facilities.  \n \n(ii)  During the last 5 years, UTY has constructed about 1,000 km of railway lines at a \ntotal cost of $1.7 billion. \n \n(iii)  UTY has experience in working with multilateral and bilateral institutions such as \nADB, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, European Union, \nKuwait Fund, and the French Government. \n \n(iv)  UTY  has  a  good  base  for  supplying  materials,  such  as  concrete  sleeper's \nproduction, a facility which was set up under an ADB project. It also has the \ncapacity to source gravel, cement, bitumen, gasoline, and concrete structures. \n \n(v)  UTY is fully-equipped with a good pool of construction equipment, such as earth- \nmoving  machines  and  specialized  rail  track-laying  machines.  A  modern  rail \nwelding center is also in place in Tashkent. \n \n47.  EPC contract. The EPC contract will have a fixed price and fixed delivery period, with \nappropriate penalties for non-performance and a bonus for timely completion. A proposal for the \nEPC contract has already been requested from UTY under direct contracting, following relevant \n                                                 \n6  ADB.  2006.  Uzbekistan:  Railway  Rehabilitation  Project.  Manila.  (Project  completion  report).  ADB.  2008. \nUzbekistan: Railway Modernization Project. Manila. (Project completion report). \n ", "10   \nprovisions from ADB's standard bidding document for procurement of plant-design, supply, and \ninstall. The proposal will require UTY to adopt a competitive process similar to ADB's 'shopping' \napproach,  inviting  a  minimum  of  3  quotations  from  both  ADB's  member  and  non-member \ncountries identified for this procurement\u2014including rail track components. Award of single-\nresponsibility turnkey contract, such as the proposed EPC contract, under the direct contracting \nmethod will allow for expedient implementation but this will be monitored strictly.  \n \n48.  Procurement process. At the request of the Government, ADB has agreed to advance \ncontracting  of  procurement  activities,  including  civil  works  and  consultants,  up  to  contract \nnegotiations. Contract negotiations will be conducted between the Government and UTY in \nOctober 2009. ADB will assist the Government during the negotiations. The procurement plan is \nin  Appendix  6.  ADB  will  engage  an  independent  expert  to  help  with  bid  evaluation,  price \nestimation and validation. The EPC will be signed between the Government and UTY. \n \n4.  Consulting Services \n49.  Consultants will be recruited and engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the \nUse of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). A consulting firm will be selected to \noversee the design and construction work, using ADB\u2019s modified quality- and cost-based (90:10 \nratio) selection procedure. Full technical proposals will be required. The Project will require a \ntotal of about 200 person-months (100 person-months international and 100 person-months \nnational and regional) of consultancy services. At the request of the Government, ADB has \nagreed to carry out the recruitment of the consulting firm for design review and construction \nsupervision. \n \n50.  MPW  will  procure  10  person-months  of  advisory  services  for  railway  sector  and \ninstitutional  development.  Individual  consultants  will  be  engaged  for  this  purpose.  The \nGovernment has agreed to recruit individual consultants in line with ADB's procedures. The \nselection and engagement of these consultants  will use position-based terms of reference \nincluded in Supplementary Appendix A. \n \n5.  Advance Contracting and Retroactive Financing \n51.  To expedite project implementation, the Government requested advance contracting and \nretroactive  financing  of  works  and  consulting  services.  Advance  contracting  allows  the \nGovernment to commence procurement activities, at its own risk, prior to the signing of relevant \nlegal agreements. The Government was informed that, in order for expenses incurred under \nadvance  contracting  to  be  eligible  for  retroactive  financing,  such  procedures  (including \nadvertising) must comply with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines and Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants, subject to the special recommendation proposed under para. 83(ii) below. Once \nthe grant becomes effective, up to 20% of the grant amount may be used to retroactively \nfinance  eligible  expenditures  incurred  during  the  period  not  exceeding  12  months  prior  to \nsigning of the grant agreement. Alternatively, the Government may opt for advance contracting \nwithout  retroactive  financing,  in  which  case, the  procurement  procedures  completed  under \nadvance contracting do not conclude with the award of contract until after the grant becomes \neffective. The Government acknowledges that any concurrence by ADB with the procedures, \ndocumentation, or proposal for award does not commit ADB to finance such expenses or the \nProject. \n \n ", "      11\n6.  Anticorruption Policy \n52.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  Government  and  MPW.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance, \naccountability, and transparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its \nagents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the Project. \nTo support these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the \ngrant regulations and the bidding documents for the Project. In particular, all contracts financed \nby ADB in connection with the Project shall include provisions specifying the right of ADB to \naudit  and  examine  the  records  and  accounts  of  the  PIU,  and  all  contractors,  suppliers, \nconsultants, and other service providers as they relate to the Project. \n \n7.  Disbursement Arrangements \n53.  Grant  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement \nHandbook. Direct payment procedures will be used for large civil works contracts and consulting \nservices. MPW will establish an imprest account at a commercial bank acceptable to ADB, with \nan initial advance equivalent to estimated eligible project expenditures for the next 6 months \nwhich are to be paid through the imprest account or 10% of the grant amount, whichever is less. \nThe imprest account will be established, managed, and liquidated in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nLoan Disbursement Handbook and detailed arrangements agreed by the Government and ADB. \nThe statement-of-expenditure procedure will be used to reimburse eligible expenditure and to \nliquidate and replenish the imprest account for individual payments of $100,000 and below. \n \n8.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n54.  MPW will maintain separate Project records and accounts identifying (i) goods, works, \nand services procured; (ii) funds received from ADB and MOF; and (iii) expenditures incurred. \nAuditors will be selected and engaged by the least-cost selection method for the consultant-\nqualifications selection method in accordance with the Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. \nThe Office of the Auditor General of Afghanistan may also conduct annual audits of overall \nMPW operations and Project accounts. Within 6 months after the end of each fiscal year, MPW \nwill submit to ADB the audited Project accounts and the auditor's reports, including separate \nopinion  on  the  use  of  the  imprest  accounts and  the  statement  of  expenditure  procedures \ncompliance with the financial covenants of the grant agreement, all in the English language. \nMPW  will  also  furnish  to  ADB  other  information  concerning  such  accounts  and  financial \nstatements and the audit thereof as ADB may request from time to time. Audited financial \nstatements should be prepared in conformity with sound accounting standards acceptable to \nADB. \n' \n9.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n55.  MPW,  assisted  by  the  design  review  and  construction  supervision  consultant,  will \ndevelop a project performance monitoring system within 3 months from Project commencement, \nwhich will contain baseline values of indicators, targets, and milestones corresponding to the \nexpected  impacts,  outcome,  outputs,  and  activities  identified  in  the  design  and  monitoring \nframework, and other relevant measures agreed between ADB and MPW. \n \n56.  The design review and supervision consultants will help MPW compile periodic data on \nkey indicators on physical components of the Project. Data will be analyzed and results of the \nanalyses and corrective measures (if any) taken will be reported in MPW's quarterly progress \nreport.  The  quarterly  progress  reports  will  also  include  physical  progress,  disbursements, \n ", "12   \nproblems (if any) encountered, actions taken, and activities planned for the following quarter. \nMPW will also perform a complete analysis of related primary and secondary data on impacts \nand outcomes within 1 month of completion of the Project. The results of that analysis will be \ncontained in the Government's project completion report to ADB, which will be submitted within \n3 months of completion of the Project. \n \n10.  Project Review \n57.  ADB will field an inception mission within 2 months of grant approval. Subsequently, the \nADB  mission  will  review  project  implementation,  including  procurement,  civil  works,  and \nenvironmental and social safeguards based on quarterly progress reports. It will meet with the \nExecutive  Committee,  MPW,  and  PIU  to  discuss  implementation  progress\u2014focusing  on \nengineering,  environmental,  and  social  safeguards  of  the  Project;  compliance  with  grant \ncovenants; and review of the financial status of the PIU. Representatives of the Executive \nCommittee and MPW will take part in the review. The review will allow for any necessary \nmidcourse corrections to ensure successful implementation and the achievement of the Project \nobjectives. ADB missions, together with the Executive Committee, MPW, and PIU\u2014will perform \non-site reviews of the Project 6 months after the project starts. This review will focus on \nidentifying causes and agreeing on measures to correct negative deviations from targets for (i) \nthe physical completion of works, (ii) disbursements, and (iii) financial and procurement audits. \n \nG.  Railway Operation Plan \n1.  New Railway Institution \n58.  The  management  of  Hairatan  railway  station  is  under  Hairatan  Port  Authority,  a \ncorporate entity, under MOCI. Railway operations between Termez and Hairatan, including the \noperation of the marshalling yard, are part of an Afghanistan-Uzbekistan Railway Agreement \nsigned in 2003. The train operation rules were agreed in 2008. \n \n59.  After the Project is completed, there will be a need to establish a more stable institutional \nframework, not only to oversee the rail link from Hairatan to Mazar-e-Sharif, but also develop \nthe Government's capacity for railway sector planning. The Government therefore plans to \ncreate  an  Afghanistan  Railway  Authority  (ARA),  a  semi-autonomous  agency.  ARA  will  be \nresponsible for O&M of the railways in Afghanistan. The following targets are envisaged: (i) ARA \nestablished by December 2010, (ii) key management and staff appointed by 2010, (iii) terms of \nreference developed, (iv) asset valuation finished, and (v) staff trained. UTY will assist the ARA. \nAn adviser will be recruited under the Project to draft an institutional plan based on preliminary \nassessment prepared under ADB's TA (footnote 1). This will be completed by April 2010. \n \n2.  Railway Operation and Maintenance Agreement \n60.  The  Government  will  outsource  the  operation  and  maintenance  of  the  rail  service \nbetween Hairatan and Mazar-e-Sharif to UTY. \n \n61.  The Government and UTY already agreed in principle on the proposed railway O&M \nmodel. This will be signed before the Project is completed.7 An adviser will be recruited to draft \nthe agreement as part of the institutional development component. The Government agreed that \na draft agreement will be developed by July 2010. \n \n                                                 \n7  A memorandum of understanding on operation and maintenance between the Government and UTY was signed \non 16 August 2009 in Kabul. \n ", "      13\nH.  Security Arrangements \n62.  The Government will provide the necessary security to the Project teams during the \nconstruction  and  operation  of  the  railway  line.  UTY  will  have  an  international  security \ncoordinator assigned to it. The coordinator will work closely with the police and MOI. The \nGovernment will arrange for security assessments through International Security Assistance \nForce (ISAF)8 and share the information with UTY and ADB (AFRM, Field Security office). The \nGovernment, through MOI, will provide security to UTY camps, project design teams, and \nconstruction staff. The Government will provide ISAF coverage to the Project site, including \nmedical and emergency services. Based on the discussions with ISAF, the Project area is likely \nto be relatively safe and no mines are prevalent or expected. However, the Government will \narrange for a demining assessment of the route before the start of civil works. Budget for \nsecurity is tentatively reserved under contingencies. \n \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \nA.  Project Benefits \n1.  Economic Benefits \n63.  Economic  analysis  was  carried  out  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Guidelines  for  the \nEconomic  Analysis  of  Projects.  The  methodology,  key  assumptions,  and  results  are \nsummarized in Appendix 7. The main project benefits comprise freight-cost savings, commodity \nloss reductions, increased trade, and incremental truck productivity. Other benefits include \navoided externality costs, reduction in road maintenance, and lower traffic. The potential Project \nbeneficiaries will be shippers, freight forwarders, and local communities. The Project's economic \ninternal rate of return (EIRR) is estimated at 15%. Women will also benefit from the Project. The \nrail line also has high regional cooperation content. \n \n64.  Sensitivity tests were carried out to assess the impact of different benefit and cost \nvariables.  Under  a  combined  freight-cost  saving  reduced  by  20%  and  construction  costs \nincreased by 10%, the EIRR is estimated at 12%. Assuming that there is no productivity gained \nby the trucks, the Project remains feasible with an EIRR of 13%. The reduction of freight \ndiversion rate from 30% to 25% will reduce the EIRR to 13%. The sensitivity tests demonstrate \nthat the Project is robust across a broad range of variations in key parameters. \n \n  2.  Financial Sustainability \n65.  ADB\u2019s  Financial  Management  and  Analysis  of  Projects  was  used  to  evaluate  the \nProject's and the ARA's financial viability. In both cases, the revenue generated from fixed fees \nand revenue-sharing arrangements lead to financial sustainability.  \n \n66.  Project  financial  viability. The Project's annual net cash flows were forecast over  \n26 years (2009\u20132035), including the construction period, under a with- and without-project \nscenarios. Constant mid-2009 prices were used to calculate the financial internal rate of return \n(FIRR) and weighted average cost of capital (WACC). The incremental cash flow included all \npayments incurred to construct, operate, and maintain the facilities over their useful life. Taxes \nand physical contingencies were included, but price contingencies were excluded. FIRR is \nestimated at 4.5% and WACC at 1.9%. This is based on generating minimum revenue of 35% \n                                                 \n8  ISAF has a peace-enforcement mandate under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter and several UN Security \nCouncil  Resolutions  (www.nato.int/ISAF/topics/mandate/index.html).  ISAF  has  been  involved  in  site  security \nassessment, providing security advice regularly, and in emergency services in Afghanistan.   \n ", "14   \nbased on rail freight transport tariffs. The project financial analysis, including its sensitivity \nanalysis, is in Appendix 8. \n \n67.  ARA  financial  sustainability. Projected financial forecasts were carried out on the \nsustainability, cost recovery, and profitability of a prospective agency. The agency financial \nperformance projection is reasonable as shown in Supplementary Appendix B. \n   \n3.  Financial Management \n68.  Financial management assessment was undertaken for MPW to evaluate its ability to \nfulfill  ADB\u2019s  fiduciary  requirements.  A  financial  management  assessment  report  is  in \nSupplementary Appendix C. \n \n69.  MPW  manages  a  number  of  ADB-funded  road  projects  and  is  familiar  with  ADB \nrequirements. The current organizational structure is adequate but financial and accounting \nservices will need to be outsourced. The financial management assessment indicates that \nMPW\u2019s financial and accounting staff does not have the relevant expertise. Training will be \nprovided to MPW staff. \n \n4.  Social Dimensions and Poverty Reduction  \n70.  A poverty and social analysis for the Project was conducted in August 2009. It involved \nkey stakeholders including local communities (including women), pastoral nomads, MPW, and \ndistrict government officials. \n \n71.  The  Project  is  located  in  the  Balkh  Province.  The  main  beneficiaries  will  be  local \ncompanies, local communities, shippers, and freight forwarders. Women will also benefit from \nthe Project. The Project will generate considerable economic and social benefits. Railways will \nlikely  attract  additional  economic  activity  into  the  area,  thus  generating  job  opportunities, \nincluding for women. \n \n72.  Women and other vulnerable groups will benefit from the Project because the railway will \ngenerate  demand  for  local  labor,  increase  economic  activity,  including  small  business \nopportunities. The expansion of secondary and tertiary industries, due to increased trade, will \nhelp generate additional employment opportunities for both men and women. \n \n73.  A summary poverty reduction and social analysis is in Appendix 9. The operation of the \nrailway could have a beneficial impact on the incident of HIV/AIDS and sexual transmitted \ndiseases. Evidence has shown that long-haul truck drivers are a primary vector for geographical \nspread of HIV/AIDS. The Project will reduce the amount of long-haul truck operations, especially \ntrucking  across  international  and  provincial  borders.  Further,  providing  modern  transport \ninfrastructure reduces the migration of workers seeking employment elsewhere, again reducing \nsexually transmitted diseases transmission vectors. The Project will not require importing a \nlarge number of workers.  \n \nB.  Project Impacts  \n1.  Social Impacts and Involuntary Resettlement \n74.  The Project entails minor land acquisition and resettlement since most of the railway \nroute passes through uninhabited and unused desert land. The impact of the railway route is \nonly on 2 vacant plots. Based on this impact, the Project has been classified B for resettlement \n ", "      15\npurposes.  A  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  plan  (LARP)  was  prepared  (Supplementary \nAppendix D). \n \n75.  None of the people affected by the Project belongs to groups classified as indigenous \npeoples under ADB's Policy on Indigenous Peoples (1998). The Project has been categorized \nas C for impacts on indigenous peoples. A summary on social safeguards is in Appendix 10. \n \n2.  Environmental Impact and Mitigation Measures \n76.  The Project is classified category B. The initial environmental examination (IEE) was \nprepared  according  to  ADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy  (2002)  and  Environmental  Assessment \nGuidelines (2003). The Project will have no major long-term adverse impact on the environment. \nShort-term impacts are considered insignificant and temporary and will be mitigated through the \nimplementation of an environmental management plan (EMP). \n \n77.  The contractor will implement appropriate mitigation measures during the construction \nperiod. MPW, through the PIU, will be assisted by the supervision consultant to (i) ensure that \nEPC contract documents clearly set out the contractor\u2019s obligations to undertake environmental \nmitigation  measures  identified  in  the  IEE  and  EMP,  (ii)  supervise  and  monitor  the \nimplementation  of  mitigation  measures  during  construction,  and  (iii)  implement  the \nenvironmental  monitoring  plan  including  reporting  requirements.  The  summary  IEE  is  in \nSupplementary Appendix E and the IEE is in Supplementary Appendix F. \n \nC.  Assumptions and Potential Risks \n78.  The  Project  assumes  maximum  coordination  efforts  by  government  agencies  in \nAfghanistan,  and  full  commitment  and  support  of  the  Balkh  Provincial  government,  local \ncommunities, and security institutions. Moreover, it is assumed that the Government will sustain \npolicies  conducive  to  economic  growth  and  remain  committed  to  regional  cooperation  and \nintegration.  \n \n79.  The Project has two major potential risks: (i) start-up and implementation delays, and (ii) \nsecurity. The Government plans strong measures to mitigate these risks. Advance actions are \nbeing taken to speed up implementation readiness. The engagement of supervision consultants \nis already underway and discussions have taken place with UTY on the basic EPC contract \nterms and conditions, including quality standards, the fixed price concept, and the fixed time \ndelivery  schedule.  A  request  for  a  proposal  from  UTY  has  also  been  advanced,  a  final \ncommitment being subject to formal approvals of the financing, and other arrangements, by \nADB and the Government of Afghanistan. ADB will act throughout as a facilitator, including at \nthe  negotiations  between  the  Government  and  UTY,  and  will  engage  the  services  of  an \nindependent railway expert to verify the price proposals by UTY. Implementation delay risks can \nbe mitigated by the EPC contract and the fact that UTY has already preliminary designs. This \ncan reduce the risk of cost overruns and cut the probability of execution extensions. On security, \nthe  Project  provides  sufficient  funds  to  mitigate  possible  security  disruptions  during \nimplementation. Close coordination with MOI has taken place.  \n \n80.  Actions are also planned to mitigate operational risks. A railway agency will be set up \nduring  the  implementation  phase  to  manage  the  rail  assets  and  ensure  their  financial \nsustainability. An advisor will be engaged under the Project to help prepare an O&M agreement \nbetween the Government and UTY, which will be signed before Project completion. ADB will \nassist the Government negotiate the contract, including defining its operational criteria and basic \n ", "16   \nterms  and  conditions.  The  agreement  will  cover  performance  benchmarks,  maintenance,  risk \nsharing, and other arrangements between the two parties. \n \nV.  ASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \nA.  Specific Assurances \n81.  The Government has given the following assurances, which will be incorporated in the \nlegal documents in addition to the standard assurances: \n \n(i)  Railway operation and maintenance. The Government plans to outsource the \nrailway O&M between Hairatan and Mazar-e-Sharif to UTY for a specific period \nof time, the duration of which will be decided by July 2010. An O&M agreement \nwill be executed between the Government and UTY by October 2010. \n(ii)  Construction  quality.  The  Government,  through  MPW,  will  ensure  that  the \nProject is carried out in accordance with the applicable technical specifications \nand design, and that the construction supervision, quality control, and project \nmanagement are performed in accordance with applicable standards and best \ninternational practices. \n(iii)  Railway safety. The Government, through MPW, will ensure that civil works \ncontracts will include the contractor\u2019s obligation to comply with safety measures \nduring construction and operation. The Government shall cause ARA to monitor \nand report the accident rate after commencement of operation of the rail service. \n(iv)  Performance targets. The Government will ensure that the civil works contract \nincorporates  specific  implementation  milestones  and  targets  with  appropriate \nreward and penalty provisions to provide reasonable economic stimuli for timely \nand qualitative Project completion. \n(v)  Environment. The Government, through MPW, will ensure that potential adverse \nenvironmental impacts arising from the Project are minimized by implementing all \nthe mitigation measures presented in the IEE and EMP. The Government will \nalso ensure that the design, construction, and operation of the Project are in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Environmental  Policy  and  the  Government\u2019s \nenvironmental laws and regulations. The Government will cause MPW to ensure \nthat: \n \n(a)  The contractor has primary responsibility for implementing the mitigation \nmeasures  and  EMP  measures.  The  PIU  head  will  have  access  to \nsufficient  resources  to  ensure  that  all  environmental  management \nprovisions are included in the contract. \n(b)  The PIU will monitor and record the implementation of the EMP prepared \nfor  the  Project,  under  the  guidance  of  the  State  Committee  for \nEnvironmental Protection-National Environment Protection Agency. \n(c)  The PIU, with the assistance of the project management and supervision \nconsultant, prepares semiannual environmental reports and submits to \nADB, within 3 months of the end of each half of the calendar year, from \nthe start of project implementation and until completion of the Project. The \nreport will include, among other things, a review of progress made on \nenvironmental measures detailed in the IEE and EMP, and problems \nencountered and remedial measures taken. \n(d)  Detailed  engineering  designs,  civil  works,  and  other  contracts  for  the \nProject facilities incorporate applicable environmental measures identified \nin the IEE and EMP. \n ", "      17\n(e)  Civil  works  contractor  is  supervised  to  ensure  compliance  with  the \n  requirements of the IEE and EMP. \n \n(vi)  Project monitoring, review, and reporting. The Government, through MPW, \nwill carry out the monitoring and evaluation of the Project in accordance with the \ndesign and monitoring framework agreed between the Government and ADB. \n(vii)  Labor, gender, health, and social protection. The Government, through MPW, \nwill include a specific provision in the EPC contract to ensure that civil works \nsubcontractors (a) comply with applicable core labor standards and labor laws, \nand  incorporate  applicable  workplace  occupational  safety  norms;  (b)  do  not \ndifferentiate payment between men and women for work of equal value; (c) do \nnot employ child labor in construction and maintenance activities; (d) eliminate \nforced  or  compulsory  labor;  (e)  eliminate  discrimination  in  respect  of \nemployment; (f) allow freedom of association; and (g) to the extent possible, \nmaximize  employment  of  local  poor  and  disadvantaged  persons  for  project \nconstruction, provided that the requirements for job and efficiency are adequately \nmet. The Government, through MPW, will ensure that appropriate entities-for \nexample nongovernment organizations-disseminate information on the risks of \nsexually transmitted infections, including HIV/AIDS, to the employees of civil \nworks  contractors  engaged  under  the  Project  and  to  members  of  the  local \ncommunities surrounding the project railway, particularly females. \n \nThe Project is implemented (a) in compliance with ADB's Policy on Gender and \nDevelopment (1998); (b) necessary steps are taken to encourage women living \nin the project area to participate in the Project related activities; (c) in consultation \nwith  local  governments  and  communities,  and  nongovernment  organizations, \nindependent  monitoring  is  carried  out  of  the  social  impacts  throughout \nimplementation of the Project. \n(viii)  Land  acquisition  and  resettlement.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  the \nProject will implement LARP and follow ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy \n(1995). MPW will ensure that, subsequent to awarding civil works contract under \nthe Project, no notice to proceed is issued to contractors for respective sections \nor parts of the Project until the applicable provisions of the LARP (including in \nparticular the timely delivery of compensation to affected families) and EMP have \nbeen complied with. \n \n(a)  LARP  shall  be  prepared  in  consultation  with,  and  disclosed  to,  the \naffected persons. \n(b)  All land and rights of way required by the Project shall be acquired and \nmade available in a timely manner. \n(c)  All  compensation  and  resettlement  assistance  shall  be  provided  to \naffected persons prior to their displacement and dispossession.  \n(d)  Efficient grievance redressal mechanism shall be in place in accordance \nwith  the  LARP  to  assist  affected  persons  in  resolving  queries  and \ncomplaints if any, in a timely manner. \n(e)  Adequate staff and resources shall be made available for supervising and \nmonitoring  implementation  of  the  LARP.  An  independent  monitor \nacceptable to ADB shall be engaged to carry out external monitoring and \nevaluation of the LARP and report the outcomes to ADB semiannually. \nSemiannual reports shall be submitted to ADB within 3 months of the end \n ", "18   \nof each period covered. The internal monitoring shall be carried out by \nMPW. \n(f)  If  during  implementation  of  the  LARP,  any  changes  to  the  location, \nrailway  alignment,  or  additional  environmental  and/or  resettlement \nimpacts are identified, the LARP shall be updated and prior approval by \nADB and the relevant government agency shall be obtained before further \nimplementation of the LARP. \n \n(ix)  Any changes to the location, land alignment of railway, or environmental impacts \non account of detailed designs of related projects will be subject to prior approval \nby ADB and the relevant government agency. \n(x)  Security. The Government will make its best efforts to provide adequate security \nand demining measures for the smooth and uninterrupted implementation of the \nProject. In addition, the Government will ensure that the civil works contracts \nhave  an  action  plan  for  adequate  security  and  smooth  and  uninterrupted \nimplementation of the Project and that the cost of implementing such a plan is \nincluded in its budget. \n(xi)  Institutional. The railway agency will develop a plan to establish its institutional \nstructure with a goal to gradual and phased disassociation from the Government \nto attain financial and operational independence by Project completion. \n(xii)  Funding and O&M. The Government will ensure that (a) additional funding will \nbe provided for successful Project implementation; and (b) in each fiscal year \nadequate funds are allocated and/or generated for O&M and that the Project \nfacilities  are  operated  and  maintained  according  to  sound  engineering  and \nbusiness practices. \n(xiii)  Financial management. MPW will ensure that it will establish and maintain a \nsound  financial  management  system,  including  establishing  separate  bank \naccounts and maintaining minimum balances to ensure smooth cash flow and \nthe timely  settlement of potential project construction liabilities. The financial \nmanagement  system  shall  comprise  (a)  financial  planning,  budgeting  and \nbudgetary  control;  (b)  accounting  consistent  with  internationally  applicable \nstandards; (c) internal control; (d) data processing; and (e) financial reports. \n(xiv)  Auditing. MPW will ensure that the financial statements of the Project accounts \nwill  be  audited  annually  in  line  with  the  international  standards  and  ADB \nrequirements. A separate auditor\u2019s opinion on the use of imprest account and \nstatement of expenditure will be incorporated in the audit reports. \n \nB.  Conditions for Disbursement \n82.  No disbursements from the grant account shall be made for the Project until ADB has \nreceived the Government\u2019s certification, in form and substance satisfactory to ADB, that the PIU \nhas been established, has been adequately equipped and staffed as agreed with ADB, and has \nbecome fully operational to implement the Project. \n \nVI.  RECOMMENDATION \n83.  I am satisfied that the proposed grant would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and,  acting  in  the  absence  of  the  President,  under  the \nprovisions of Article 35.1 of the Articles of Agreement of ADB, recommend that the Board \napprove \n \n ", "      19\n(i)  the grant not exceeding $165,000,000 to the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan for \nthe  Hairatan  to  Mazar-e-Sharif  Railway  Project  from  ADB's  Special  Funds \nresources, on terms and conditions that are substantially in accordance with \nthose set forth in the draft Grant Agreement presented to the Board; and \n \n(ii)  the  proposal  set  forth  in  para.  45  of  this  report  that  rail  track  components \nprocured from non-member countries of ADB be eligible for financing under the \nHairatan  to  Mazar-e-Sharif  Railway  Project.  If  this  recommendation  is  not \napproved and the Board only approves the recommendation in para. 83(i), then \nrail  track  components  procured  only  from  member  countries  of  ADB  will  be \neligible for financing under the Project. \n \n \nC.

Status of Transport Infrastructure and Services \n1.  Afghanistan\u2019s  transport  system  comprises  road,  rail,  air,  and  inland  waterways.  \nThe official road network spans 38,500 kilometers (km): 300 km of regional roads, 4,700 km of \nnational roads, 9,700 km of provincial roads, 17,000 km of rural roads, and 3,800 km of urban \nroads.  The  total  length  of  railways  is  25  km,  which  are  cross-border  extensions  from \nTurkmenistan and Uzbekistan to transshipment yards in Torghandi and Hairatan, respectively \n(about 10 km and 15 km from the respective borders). Inland waterways are limited to the Amu \nDarya and its tributaries,1 although only the formal inland port at Shirkhan Bandar is operational \nat present. There are more than 60 airports and airfields spread across the country. There are \ntwo international and 22 domestic airports that meet International Civil Aviation Organization \n(ICAO) Class 4 categorization standards.2 By 2010, the Kabul International Airport and Herat \nAirport  are  expected  to  achieve  full  international  ICAO  compliance  while  Mazar-e-Sharif, \nJalalabad, and Kandahar airports will be upgraded.  \n \n2.  At the end of 2001, more than 90% of the transport system was unconnected and was in \npoor condition. Since then, the donors have helped improve key infrastructure, especially roads. \nAbout 86% of the regional road network is scheduled to be operational by end 2008 with the \nremainder to be completed by 2010. Work is underway or funding has been obtained for the \nremaining regional roads, with the exception of a 50 km section east of Herat. The improved \nroads include almost 2,100 km (63%) of regional roads, 650 km (14%) of national roads, and \n6,000 km of provincial and rural roads. Roads serve 90% of the national and regional travel \ndemand. \n \n3.  Rail services at Hairatan move about 250 wagons a day, while in Torghandi it is about \n50 wagons a day. The major imports are petroleum products and humanitarian food aid and at \nTorghandi, scrap metal is transshipped by truck to Pakistan. There is little reverse traffic except \nfor  some  seasonal  fruit.  The  Kabul  International  Airport  handled  approximately  0.5  million \ninternational and domestic passengers in 2005, and civil aviation generated about $40 million \nfrom commercial over flights and airport taxes.   \n \n4.  In 2007, registered vehicles included over 300,000 cars, 40,000 buses, 100,000 trucks, \n100,000 motorcycles, and 5,000 rickshaws. Vehicle numbers increased rapidly, with annual \ngrowth over the past 3 years of 23% for cars, 15% for trucks, 48% for motorcycles, but only 2% \nfor buses and rickshaws. Virtually all vehicles are second-hand imports from Japan and Europe. \n \n5.  Domestic  air  passenger  and  freight  services  are  provided  by  the  state  carrier  and \nseveral private carriers. At least daily flights are available between Kabul and most cities.  \nInternational services between Kabul and several Asian destinations are provided by both \nnational and international carriers. Airport facilities are limited and in a poor state of repair. \nBesides  Kabul,  Mazar-e-Sharif  is  the  only  main  airport  due  for  major  reconstruction  and \nexpansion. A new 3,000 meter runway is being constructed. About 600 meters of the existing \nrunway are being repaired, including new taxiways. This will increase capacity for the intermodal \nflow of commercial goods. \n \n                                                 \n1  Dachiku,  Kiyoshi  and  Azeem  Tahir.  2002.

A private foundation operates a passenger ferry three to four times daily to Tajikistan. \nTajikistan\u2019s state-owned barge service ferries trucks a few times per day, depending on traffic. A \nroad bridge across the Pyanzh River near Shirkhan Bandar was completed in 2007 with funding \nfrom the United States Agency for International Development. The traffic potential through this \nborder crossing is significant and plans are being made for full border facilities. \n \n7.  Two hundred and fifty-three private bus companies\u2014135 based in Kabul and 118 in the \nprovinces\u2014with a fleet of 38,568 buses operate intercity services on the regional and national \nroads. The remaining buses are 8- to 12-seat vans owned by individuals providing informal \npassenger transport services in the cities and connections between rural areas and towns.  \nThe only cross-border bus service is between Jalalabad and Peshawar. An estimated 45 million \npassenger trips were made by bus transport in 2005.  \n \n8.  More than 150 registered taxi companies operate in the country\u201453 in Kabul with a fleet \nof 16,309 taxis and 108 in the provinces with a fleet of 30,248. In 2007, the taxi fares varied \nfrom $0.01/km to $0.03/km depending on various classes of passenger vehicles and terrain \ntypes for paved roads, whereas it varied from $0.015/km to $0.03/km for unpaved roads. \nOperators pay a 3% commission to the Government at provincial or national borders and at the \noutskirts of major towns. \n \n9.  Freight is carried primarily in private owned trucks. The truck population is approximately \n20% heavy articulated trucks with the remaining 80% divided equally into heavy, medium, and \nlight or pickup classes. Freight charges are approximately $0.07/ton-km on paved roads and \n$0.08/ton-km on unpaved roads. A 5% commission per trip is levied by the Government. There \nare no special transit charges and foreign trucks transporting freight through Afghanistan are \ncharged the 5% commission only. \n \nB.  Institutional and Regulatory Frameworks \n10.  Multiple government ministries are involved in operating and regulating the transport \nsector: Ministry of Public Works (MPW), Ministry of Transportation and Civil Aviation, Ministry of \nUrban Development (MOUD), Ministry of Rural Rehabilitation and Development (MRRD), and \nthe Ministry of Interior (MOI). Local authorities are also involved. In the road subsector, MPW is \nassigned  the  responsibility  for  planning,  designing,  constructing,  and  maintaining  regional, \nnational, and provincial roads. MRRD is responsible for rural roads, and MOUD and the local \nauthorities administer the urban roads. There have been discussions at a high level about \ngovernance of the sector transitioning to international best practices within the Afghan context. \nThis is expected to be achieved by merging the MPW and the Ministry of Transportation and \nCivil Aviation, plus those units in MRRD, MOI, and MOUD dealing with transport into a single \nMinistry of Transport by 2009.  \n \n11.  MPW has a workforce of approximately 200 engineers and administrative staff, as well \nas 2,000 laborers at the regional maintenance centers and provinces. At present, however, it \nserves as administrator for donor-financed projects and executor of budget-financed minor \nconstruction  and  maintenance  works.  MOTCA  issues  operating  and  transit  permits,  sets \ntechnical standards and tariffs, collects road-user fees, and enforces standards and tariffs. \nIt also provides passenger and freight transport services using state-owned vehicles. Legislation \nin 2008 has authorized the Government to provide nationwide freight and passenger services. \nMOI carries out vehicle registration and administers driver training, testing, and driver licensing. \n \n \n ", " 24  Appendix 2 \nC.  Policy and Legal Frameworks \n12.  Afghanistan is yet to formulate a transport policy. However, the Afghanistan National \nDevelopment Strategy, which was launched in April 2008, guides investment and reforms in the \nsector. In the road subsector, the MPW Strategy under the ANDS calls for investments to \nupgrade and maintain the Ring Road and roads to neighboring countries by the end of 2009, as \nwell as to establish a fiscally sustainable system for road maintenance using private contractors \nas much as possible by 2008. Also, it calls for 40% of all villages to be connected by all-weather \nroads to the national road system and 40% of all roads in municipalities to be improved to a \ngood standard by 2010. The current situation is that 86% of the regional road network is \nscheduled for completion by end-2008 and the remaining length will completed by 2009 or \n2010. \n \n13.  In  addition  to  the  Civil  Aviation  Law,  Law  of  Highway  Traffic,  Law  on  Regulating \nMovement and Function of Land Transportation Vehicles, Law for Punishment of Transport \nViolators, and Law for International Transit and Transport, which have direct relevance to the \nsector,  much  new  legislation  affecting  its  performance  has  been  enacted  or  existing  laws \namended in the past 5 years. Among these are the Environment Law, Law on Preservation of \nHistoric and Cultural Artifacts, Customs Law, Procurement Law, and the Law on Taxing Driving \nPermits for Motor Vehicles. \n \nD.  Government Plan for Railway Development \n14.  Railway development is a solution to improve undeveloped regional connectivity as \nshown in the problem tree analysis (Figure A2). There are proposals to construct three new \nrailway links into Afghanistan; one from the Pakistan border at Chaman to Kandahar; one from \nSangan, in Iran territory, to Herat and the third from Hairatan (in Afghanistan, opposite from the \nUzbekistan town of Termez) to Mazar-e-Sharif. The only one of these routes where railway track \nexists within Afghanistan territory is in the Afghan town of Hairatan. Another rail line enters \nAfghanistan  at  Torghandi,  just  across  the  Turkmenistan  border.  The  line  terminates  at \nTorghandi with commodities (mostly fuel) transshipped to Afghan trucks for further movement \nwithin Afghanistan. The existing rail line from Termez, in Uzbekistan, currently terminates at the \nAfghanistan border town of Hairatan. Freight destined for Afghanistan, or beyond, is off-loaded \nat Hairatan and reloaded to Afghan trucks for movement through Afghanistan. \n \n15.  The Government plans to develop a railway network in north Afghanistan with three \nmain sections: (i) Hairatan to Mazar-e-Sharif, (ii) Mazar-e-Sharif to Herat, and (iii) Mazar-e-\nSharif to Tajikistan. The Government top priority is to construct a new railway line linking \nHairatan with Mazar-e-Sharif. The primary transit traffic would be export cotton while most traffic \ndestined for Afghanistan moving through this border post is fuel. At the present time, most of \nUzbekistan export cotton is moved by rail through Turkmenistan and Iran to the port of Bandar \nAbbas. An extension of the rail line into Afghanistan would make the new route to Charbakhar \nmore attractive. \n \n16.  Rail links to Afghanistan are important as bulk commodities (such as fuel) are brought to \nthe Afghanistan border by rail, then transshipped to truck for the movement within the country. \nTransport costs of bulk commodities are typically cheaper by rail than road; therefore, extension \nof these existing rail lines into Afghanistan would result in significant savings of transport costs \nfor  this  strategic  commodity.  While  Afghanistan  has  no  railways  at  the  present  time,  rail \ntransport costs can be estimated using results from studies recently undertaken in neighboring \ncountries. This comparison of road and rail transport costs results in a savings of $0.0256 per \n ", "Appendix 2  2 5\nton kilometer. This differential in transport costs represents savings in transport costs if the rail \nis used, instead of road.  \n \n17.  Construction of a railway line through part of Afghanistan would improve the route that \nmay well generate this increase in cotton exports through Afghanistan. Considering only the fuel \nimports plus the potential for cotton movements, a total estimated traffic volume of nearly 1 \nmillion tons could be moved over a new railway line. \n \n18.  Hairatan station had a capacity of handling 600 wagons per day. But the capacity has \nbeen reduced because many of the yard lines are age-old, deplorable and unsafe for train \noperation (only 32 km out of 40 km is operative). Uzbekistan Railways plans to augment the \nwagon handling capacity from 300\u2013400 wagons a day to about 1,000 wagons (200\u2013280 trains) \na day. Majority of the traffic (more than 50%) handled in Hairatan is petroleum oil. The rests are \ntimber, steel, and food grains. \n \nFigure A2: Problem Tree Analysis \n \n   \nUnsustainable Development \n \n \n  Inefficient Transport System \n \n \n \nLack and High Cost of  Low Transport Infrastructure  Underdeveloped Regional \n  Transport Services  Density   Connectivity \n \n \n \n           \n    Lim ited    Inade quate    Undeve loped   \nPoor  Limited  Cross-border  Lack of \n  Infrastructure  TPrroanvsidpeorrst   Network  LPalanndn Uinsge   Bottlenecks  PRoateilnwtiaayls   Planning \n \n \n \n \n  Lack of Sector Coordination and \nLimited Budget for Investment and Maintenance  Human Resource Capacity \n \n \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n ", " \nDETAILED COST ESTIMATES  2\n6\n \nItem      By Financier \nA\nTotal  % of  %    %  p\np\nCost  Base Cost  ADB  ADB  GOVT GOVT  e\nn\nd\nA.

Project Alternative and Rationale  \n1.  The freight movement between Hairatan and Mazar-e-Sharif increased from about 8,000 \nton in 2004 to about 12,000 ton in 2008 and is expected to increase slightly higher than the last \n7 years. Gross domestic product grew on average by about 11% per year. To accommodate the \ngrowing demand for freight transport, two options could be considered: (i) expansion of the \nexisting road, or (ii) building of a new railway line between Hairatan and Mazar-e-Sharif.  \n \n2.  Transport costs of bulk commodities are typically cheaper by rail than road; therefore, \nbuilding a new railway line would result in significant savings of transport costs. The new railway \nline will also divert the road transport to rail that reduces the transport costs by road, traffic \naccidents, pollution, and green house gasses. The diversion of road to rail freight will reduce the \nroad maintenance costs. It demonstrates that the proposed railway is the least cost option for \nmeeting the growing freight demand. \n \n3.  The potential demand for freight by rail is estimated at about 5,000 ton/day at the first \nyear of operation and in 2026 will reach approximately 30,000 ton/day, which is considered as \nthe maximum capacity of the railway line.  \n \n4.  The existing rail line from Termez in Uzbekistan currently terminates at the Afghanistan \nborder town of Hairatan. Freight destined for Afghanistan, or beyond, is off-loaded at Hairatan \nand  reloaded  to  Afghan  trucks  for  movement  in  or  through  Afghanistan.  The  Project  will \nconstruct a new railway line linking Hairatan with Mazar-e-Sharif (approximately 75 kilometers) \nand  rehabilitate  the  marshalling  yard  in  Hairatan.  The  new  railway  line  will  eventually  be \nextended to the southwest of the country to the Iranian border and to the port of Charbakhar.  \n \n5.  The Project railway line is part of the larger railway network in Afghanistan. The Project \nbenefits will be higher once the railway network is completed. In the long run, the primary transit \ntraffic  through  Afghanistan  will  potentially  be  cotton  from  Uzbekistan.  At  present,  most  of \nUzbekistan's cotton export is moved by rail through Turkmenistan and Iran to the port of Bandar \nAbbas. An extension of the rail line into Afghanistan would make the new route to Charbakhar \nPort in Iran more attractive. These cotton exports could be routed through Afghanistan to the \nport of Charbakhar, if the route is to be constructed and improved. However, this will unlikely to \nhappen within the short period and therefore will not be quantified in the economic analysis. \n \nB.  Demand Forecast \n6.  The  freight  traffic  on  the  existing  Hairatan\u2013Naibabad\u2013Mazar-e-Sharif  road  was  first \nprojected. Then, the diversion potential of the freight traffic to the railway mode was considered.  \nThe growth rates of freight travel demand have been obtained by multiplying the elasticity of \ndemand of freight traffic at the national level with respect to the dominant economic parameter \nwith the expected growth rate of dominant economic parameter.   \n \n7.  The freight rail traffic is expected from regional freight currently transported by trucks and \ncombined rail and truck. The freight can be divided into general and bulk cargo (mostly oil and \ngas from Uzbekistan). It is assumed that oil and gas transported by rail will continue to be \ntransported by rail to be unloaded in Mazar-e-Sharif. General cargo is transported by either rail \nor rail-road transport. General cargo currently transported by rail will likely to use the new \nrailway and some of those transported by road will shift to rail-road transport. Some will continue \nusing road transport especially those originating from or going to cities beyond Naibabad. \n \n \n ", "Appendix 7  3 3\nC.  Economic Analysis Approach \n8.  An economic analysis was carried out comparing with- and without-project scenarios. \nThe base case reflects expected conditions in the absence of the Project, with maintenance \nsufficient only to hold the railway in its present condition. The project case involves initial \ninvestment followed by routine and periodic maintenance, but with expenditure and frequency of \nperiodic maintenance economically optimum. All costs and benefits are expressed in constant \nmid-2009 prices. The economic analysis covers the construction period of 2 years plus 25 years \nof operation and maintenance. \n \n9.  Economic analysis was conducted using border price numeraire. A standard conversion \nfactor for non-tradable goods was applied to calculate the economic price of non-tradable \ngoods. The shadow wage rates for skilled and unskilled labor were estimated by comparing the \naverage labor wage in the region and the project labor wage, taking into consideration the \nexisting  unemployment  rate.  The  shadow  wage  rates  for  skilled  and  unskilled  labor  were \nadjusted by the standard conversion factor.  \n \n10.  The  economic  costs  were  estimated  based  on  financial  costs,  including  physical \ncontingencies. Price escalation, contingencies, and taxes were excluded. Financial costs were \nconverted into economic costs using specific conversion factors of 0.98 for civil works and 0.90 \nfor railway maintenance. A specific conversion factor of 0.85 was used to convert the financial \nprice of transport cost and time value savings. Economic internal rates of return (EIRRs) were \ncalculated for various scenarios to evaluate the economic viability of the Project. \n \nD.  Economic Cost \n11.  The initial investment for civil works will be implemented over a 2-year period of 2009\u2013\n2010. The economic cost (taxes excluded) is summarized in Table A7.1. A residual value at the \nend of evaluation period is estimated at 20% of the initial investment.  \n \nTable A7.1: Unit Costs  \n \nWorks  Cost \nCapital works  $156.3 million (base cost and physical contingencies). \nRoutine maintenance and  1% of the capital cost per year  \noperation \nPeriodic maintenance   5% of capital cost in years 2016 and 2026  \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nE.  Economic Benefits \n  1.  Freight cost savings \n12.  The primary economic benefits are freight cost savings. The cost of rail transport is \nestimated at $0.07 per ton-kilometer. An interview survey with freight forwarders shows that the \nroad transport cost for freight amounts to about $0.14 per ton-kilometer, resulting in a transport \ncost savings of $0.07 per ton-kilometer. \n \n  2.  Truck productivity gained \n13.  The trucks will not be required to travel to Hairatan either to load or unload their goods. \nThis will cause savings of time and hence increased truck productivity especially for trucks \ncarrying general cargoes. About 50% of the trucks will benefit from 2-3 hours per day time \nsavings.  \n \n \n ", "34  Appendix 7 \n  3.  Time savings due to marshalling yard improvement \n14.  The primary economic benefits of the marshalling yard improvement consist of lower \nshunting costs, reduced wagon detention in the yard, less waiting time outside the yard, and \nless  damage  to  wagons  and  freight.  It  is  assumed  that  the  improved  marshalling  yard  at \nHairatan will save 20 minutes handling per wagon. Valuation of commodity time is derived from \na truck net income estimate.  \n \n  4.  Other benefits \n15.  The Project will generate the benefit from the reduction in traffic accidents, pollution, and \ngreen house gasses. Carbon dioxide rate for freight rail is only about 10% of that of freight road. \nThe external cost saving estimates range from $7 to $70 per 1000 ton-kilometer.1 Benefits from \ngenerated road traffic may be expected but is assumed to be negligible in the base case \nanalysis. The Project will also reduce the road maintenance cost due to lower heavy vehicle \ntraffic.

Introduction \n1.  The financial evaluation of the Project was carried out in accordance with the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB)\u2019s Financial Management and Analysis of Projects.1  \n \nB.  Methodology and Major Assumptions \n2.  The  Project's  annual  net  cash  flows  were  forecasted  over  26  years  (2009\u20132035) \nincluding the construction period under a with- and without-project scenario. Constant mid-2009 \nprices were used to calculate the financial internal rate of return (FIRR) and weighted average \ncost of capital (WACC). The incremental cash flows included all payments incurred to construct, \noperate, and maintain the Project facilities over its useful life. Taxes and physical contingencies \nwere included, but price contingencies were excluded. Salvage value of 20% was considered at \nthe end of the Project. The revenue generated from fixed fees or revenue sharing arrangements \nwith a prospective train operator (in this case UTY) is the main source of operating cash inflow.  \nThe resulting FIRR is estimated at 4.5% and WACC at 1.9%. This is based on generating \nminimum  revenue  of  at  least  35%  of  rail  freight  transport  tariff  assumed  to  be  $0.07/ton-\nkilometers.  \n \nC.  Weighted Average Cost of Capital \n3.  It was assumed that ADB incurs an opportunity cost of 3% based on a 5 year forward \nLondon  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR).  The  real  weighted  average  cost  of  capital  was \ncalculated at 1.9%.

Track access charge for freight rail ranges from $1.5 to $5 per 1,000 ton-kilometer.2 \nAssuming that the freight rail tariff is about $0.07/ton-kilometer, the track access charge is \napproximately 2\u20137% of the tariff for operations. The railway operation will be done under a \nleasing  agreement  between  the  train  operator  (UTY)  and  the  Government.  The  Project's \nfinancial viability depends on the revenue sharing between UTY and the railway agency. The \nProject will be financially viable if the revenue from the Government comprises about 35% of the \ntariff. Without accounting for capital expenditure, about 3% of tariff will breakeven. As a result, \nabout $0.025/ton-kilometers of fee recovered from UTY generates a financial internal rate of \nreturn (FIRR) of 4.5% and a WACC of 1.9%. \n \nTable A8.2: Financial Analysis for Rail Equipment  \n($ million) \nYear  Cash Outflow  Cash Inflow \nCapital  Operating  Operating  Net Free Cash \nExpenditure  Outflows  Inflows  Flow \n2009     15.57  0.00  0.00      (15.57) \n2010  140.13  0.00  0.00          (140.13) \n2011    1.56  3.57  2.01 \n2012    1.56  4.02  2.46 \n2013    1.56  4.52  2.96 \n2014    1.56  5.09  3.53 \n2015    1.56  5.73  4.17 \n2016    7.79  6.44       (1.34) \n2017    1.56  7.25  5.70 \n2018    1.56  8.16  6.60 \n2019    1.56  9.19  7.63 \n2020    1.56  10.34  8.78 \n2021    1.56  11.63  10.08 \n2022    1.56  13.09  11.53 \n2023    1.56  14.73  13.18 \n2024    1.56  16.58  15.02 \n2025    1.56  18.66  17.10 \n2026    7.79  21.00  13.22 \n2027    1.56  21.00  19.44 \n2028    1.56  21.00  19.44 \n2029    1.56  21.00  19.44 \n2030    1.56  21.00  19.44 \n2031    1.56  21.00  19.44 \n2032    1.56  21.00  19.44 \n2033    1.56  21.00  19.44 \n2034    1.56  21.00  19.44 \n2035  (31.14)  1.56  21.00  50.58 \n      FIRR         4.48% \n      NPV    79.17 \n( ) = negative, FIRR = financial internal rate of return, NPV = net present value, WACC = \nweighted average cost of capital.  \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n                                                 \n2  The  European  Conference  of  Ministers  of  Transport.  2005.

POVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA  Link to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \n \nThe Government gives high priority to the Project. The Project is consistent with the Asian Development Bank (ADB)'s \nCountry Partnership Strategy (2009\u20132013), which aims to enhance pro-poor economic growth through transport infrastructure \ndevelopment. The railway will serve as a key transport link for Afghanistan because it has significant mineral, industrial, and \nagricultural potential, which requires a reliable and cost-effective transport system. From the neighboring countries like \nUzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Pakistan, all imports and transit goods are brought to the borders by rail, and then \ntransshipped onto the trucks for movement within Afghanistan or across the borders. The extraction of natural resources from \nmajor mines in Afghanistan requires a sustainable and safe mode of transport. Although the road network, which carries the \nmajority of the country's freight and passenger traffic, is being improved, the transport system remains inadequate, inefficient, \nand unsafe. Only half of the roads that connect 24 provinces of the country are serviceable throughout the year, greatly \nrestricting job creation and economic growth. A railway network will complement roads. It will (i) offer an affordable means of \nmass transport for sustained growth and poverty reduction, (ii) form part of an integrated multimodal transport system to \nenable seamless connectivity from origin to destination for goods and passengers, and (iii) link this landlocked country to \nnearby seaports and trade centers.  \n \nThe Project will contribute to poverty reduction by (i) constructing a railway line in the northern region of Afghanistan, (ii) \nserving the country by increased economic development, employment opportunities, and (iii) contributing to the social and \neconomic development in the region by facilitating the increased mobility and accessibility of goods across Afghanistan. The \nProject will increase access to urban markets for both agricultural and mineral products, and improve rural people access to \neducation and health facilities.  \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                  Targeting Classification: General Intervention \n1.  Key Issues  \n \nThe development of the Project area is suffering with insufficient resources of supply and high prices of agricultural inputs, \nconsumable goods, and construction materials. Local communities are not connected with regular transport system. Initiative \nfor local investment and scope of employment is handicapped. All such situations due to insufficient and unsecured transport \nsystem. The community people deprived from uniform delivery of health services and technical and higher education.  \n \nThere is no official data on the rate of poverty for Afghanistan or the provinces. ADB estimated about 53% of Afghan people \nliving in poverty. Most of them have a very low income. On average it is estimated about $2 per household per day. Including \nsmall farmers, landless laborers, ex-combatants, war widows, war orphans, debtors, sharecroppers, returning refugees, \ninternally displaced persons about six million Afghans are vulnerable.  \n \nThe main causes of poverty in the project areas are insufficient scope of irrigation, lack of infrastructure, and very limited and \nunsustainable sources of livelihood. Drought is one the major constraints for agriculture and livelihoods development in \nAfghanistan. \n \nThe construction and operation of the project railway line will generate significant employment in local communities, which will \nbe  targeted  at  local  communities  with  high  priorities  for  the  poor  and  vulnerable  people  of  surrounding  villages  or \ncommunities. Construction access and roads connecting to the railway will directly benefit poor villages by helping extend the \nproject benefits and opportunities to the  poor communities. Station area development  will encourage small business \ndevelopment among local people, including women and the poor. The scope of local and rural industries will be increased, \nwhich will create jobs for the poor and vulnerable peoples.  \n \nThe Project will enable local people and community to get easy access to market network and social services by creating a \nsafe and cheaper transport network. Prices of essential commodities and construction materials will be cut. The initiative for \nrural and industrial development through exploiting local resources will increase. Local production and employment as well as \nincome level of the local people will increase. The affordability and capacity will increase, which will contribute to poverty \nreduction. \n \n ", "Appendix 9  41\n2.  Design Features \n \nThe Project will involve civil and railway works, using mostly machinery and skilled labor. Only a limited number of unskilled \nlabor will be needed during construction and maintenance. There will be small business opportunities to local poor at station \nareas during operation. \n \nII.  SOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.  Findings of Social Analysis  \n \nPoverty and social assessment has been prepared based on secondary data and consultation and meeting at different \nstages. Detailed poverty profile will be prepared through socioeconomic base line surveys. \n \nAccess to education in Afghanistan is limited. The primary gross enrolment rate has been recently estimated at 39% for boys \nand 3% for girls. According to the World Bank report (2002), infant mortality is estimated to be one of the highest in the world \nat around 165 per 1,000 live births, while 257 of every 1,000 live births die before they are five. The maternal mortality rate is \nestimated to be 1,700 per 100,000 live births, and life expectancy at birth is estimated at around 41 years of age.  \n \nAlthough Afghanistan has no significant experience of vulnerability of HIV/AIDS, there will be need of increased awareness \nbecause the bigger transport infrastructure network may bears risk of spreading of HIV/AIDS. Local government institutions \nand nongovernment organizations should be assigned responsibilities for information campaigning and supporting activities. \n \nThe benefits of the Project can be classified as direct and indirect. Direct beneficiaries include the people who will be \nemployed under the Project, start business in the railway stations, and use this railway services for carrying the goods for \nbusiness. The community as whole will be the indirect beneficiaries of Project as they will have scope receiving social \nservices and buying consumer goods and services at comparatively cheaper prices.  \n \nB.  Consultation and Participation \n1.  Provide a summary of the consultation and participation process during the project preparation. \n \nConsultations were conducted on 20, 27, 30 July and 8 August 2009 at Taza Omed, Gore-e-More, Qalinbafan\u2019s Camp and \nHairatan, respectively. The issues discussed in the consultations included merits and demerits of the railway alignment, and \nland acquisition, and resettlement. The consultations were open for all to share and exchange views, ideas, and experiences. \nConsultation held with the people of Qalinbafan\u2019s Camp village on 14 August 2009 reassessed affected land, and presented \nposition and ownership of land and its price. Discussion held with the Ministry of Public Works on 14 August 2009 focused on \nissues relating to affected land, prices of land, and the process of compensation. \n \nDecisions and Recommendations of the Consultation Sessions are: \nRailway must go through government land; agriculture land should not be used because it is limited for production; affected \npeople should get cash compensation of any affected property including land so that they can use the money according to \ntheir choice; they expressed their interest to establish the Project railway line because they will have safe transpiration and \nthe prices will be cheaper and business facilities will be increased. \n \nIn conclusion of each consultation, local people welcomed this Project as they believe the Project will contribute to their \nsocioeconomic development. \n \n2.

Was a C&P plan prepared?   Yes      No  \n \nC.  Gender and Development \n1.  Key Issues \n \nIn Afghanistan women are generally denied of their rights in participating in decision-making in the community, acquiring \neducation, and having adequate food and nutrition. Most literature indicates that women in the country are given lower status \nthan men. In practice, men exercise control over all aspects of women\u2019s lives in accordance to traditional value. \n \n ", "42   Appendix 9 \nCulturally, women\u2019s role is limited to home or homestead as mothers and housewives help the family in their farming \nactivities. Sometimes they go to bazaar to purchase household items. In rural areas, they collect wood for fuel and drinking \nwater from well or river from the distance of one or two kilometers in some cases. \nThe Project is not expected to exacerbate gender inequities. It offers the possibility of increasing female participation in the \npaid labor force. The civil work contract will include the provisions that will not allow discriminations against female \nemployment and encourage it. Women and other vulnerable groups will benefit from the Project, as they will have greater \naccessibility in employment opportunity and wage earning scope created by the establishment and operation of the Project. \n \n2.

The Government of Afghanistan has requested ADB for a grant for the Hairatan to \nMazar-e-Sharif Railway Project. The Project, with the Ministry of Public Works (MPW) as the \nexecuting agency, will include the construction of about 75 km-long railway between Hairatan and \nMazar-e-Sharif, with a station in the proximity of the Mazar-e-Sharif Airport.  \n \nA.  Land Acquisition and Resettlement \n2.  The Project entails minor land acquisition and resettlement impacts since most of the \nrailway's route passes through uninhabited and unused desert land. Along the 75 km railway \nbetween Hairatan and Mazar-e-Sharif, the impacts are only two residential plots without any \nstructure built on the plots. The two affected households will have to be compensated for their \nland.  \n \n3.  To plan the compensation of these impacts MPW has prepared a short land acquisition \nand resettlement plan (LARP). The document fit the provisions of the relevant Afghanistan laws, \nADB\u2019s Policy on Involuntary Resettlement (1995), and Operations Manual F2 on Involuntary \nResettlement (2006).
