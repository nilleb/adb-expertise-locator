THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nthe Islamic Republic of Pakistan for the Punjab Intermediate Cities Improvement Investment \nProject.  \n \n2.  The project will improve the quality of life of residents in the two intermediate cities of \nSahiwal and Sialkot in Punjab Province. This will be achieved by improving urban infrastructure \nand services and enhancing the operation and maintenance (O&M) capacity for urban service \ndelivery.1 \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n1.  Background \n \n3.  Cities are the economic, social, and innovative core of Pakistan. They generate most of \nthe country\u2019s wealth and are home to about 40% of the population.2 Pakistan\u2019s cities, particularly \nthe intermediate cities,3  are developing at a fast rate. This has led to rapid expansion of the urban \nenvironment in an uncoordinated, unplanned, and unregulated manner. Basic urban services, \nsuch as water supply, wastewater collection and treatment, storm water drainage, and the urban \nroad  networks,  are  increasingly  unable  to  respond  to  population  pressures  and  economic \ndemands. Residents are suffering from an acute shortage of open spaces and civic amenities. \nThis has increased demand to make Pakistan\u2019s cities more livable\u2014to promote better living \nstandards, improve public health, and develop the country\u2019s economy in a sustainable manner. \n  \n4.  The Government of Pakistan has realized the importance of making its cities more livable, \nparticularly the intermediate cities, and has put the urban sector at the forefront of its national \ndevelopment strategy. Pakistan\u2019s Vision 20304 and Framework for Economic Growth5 envisage \nlivable  cities  as  engines  of  national  growth  and  centers  of  economic activity,  culture,  and \nknowledge.  The  Framework  for  Economic  Growth  also  recognizes  the  advantage  of  local \ngovernments in managing urban development, being closer to the beneficiary population, better \nsituated to identify citizens\u2019 preferences, and having the flexibility to respond rapidly to cities\u2019 \nevolving needs. The government amended its constitution in 2010 to decentralize urban services \nto the provincial governments.6  \n  \n5.  About 53% of Pakistan\u2019s urban population lives in Punjab cities, and the urban areas of \nPunjab generate an estimated 50% of the country\u2019s gross domestic product.7 The Government of \nPunjab has pioneered several key urban sector initiatives. In 2006, it created the Urban Unit to \nmanage urban sector issues in Punjab Province. Following the positive experience in Punjab, \n                                                \n1  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB) provided  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  through  the  Punjab \nIntermediate Cities Improvement Investment Program (TA 8683-PAK), as well as through resources from the Urban \nClimate Change Resilience Trust Fund and the Cities Development Initiative for Asia. \n2  Government of Pakistan, Finance Division. 2016.

Islamabad. \n \n ", "2   \nother  provincial  governments  established  urban  units  using  a  similar  approach.  The  Local \nGovernment  and  Community  Development  (LG&CD)  Department  of  Punjab  is  the  line \ngovernment ministry responsible for providing municipal services at provincial level.  \n \n2.  Challenges and Opportunities \n \n6.  In its Medium-Term Development Framework, 2013\u20132016,8 the Government of Punjab \nincluded an urban sector development strategy, comprising 106 urban projects. As part of the \nimplementation of this framework, the Government of Punjab requested the Asian Development \nBank (ADB) and the Cities Development Initiative for Asia to undertake a comprehensive urban \n \nsector assessment,9 which identified the following challenges and opportunities in making the \ncities in Punjab more livable and sustainable. \n \n7.  Inadequate infrastructure. The urban population in Punjab, the most populous province \nin Pakistan, is growing at an unprecedented speed\u2014demographic projections show a rise from \nthe current 32 million to 60 million by 2030 (footnote 8). Despite government efforts, urban \ninfrastructure development has not kept pace with the rapid population growth. Punjab\u2019s cities \nprovide piped water to only 45% of their residents while more than half of the wastewater flows in \nopen drains and is discharged untreated into natural water bodies or onto agricultural lands. Poor \npublic transport and inadequate street management constrain urban mobility. Much of the cities\u2019 \ndaily economic activity takes place along narrow inner city streets competing with buses, cars, \nmotorcycles, and pedestrians.  \n \n8.  Poor capacity and weak institutional framework. The Government of Punjab currently \nprovides key urban services at city level but these services are often unreliable and do not meet \nthe service standards customers expect. Improvement of urban services in Punjab is limited by \ninadequate staff capacity and a weak institutional framework, which offers little incentive to staff \nand no accountability to customers. Little attention has been paid to day-to-day operations and \nservice provisions.  A new institutional setup is urgently needed to restore public confidence in \nkey urban services. The project will support the Government of Punjab to establish urban services \ncompanies in the cities of Sahiwal and Sialkot. The Government of Punjab will entrust the above \nurban services companies with the responsibility of municipal services including water, sanitation, \nand  urban  spaces  management.  These  companies  will  adopt  key  corporate  governance \nrequirements. For instance, the board of directors in the companies will oversee and manage the \ncompany\u2019s  strategic  directions,  policies,  service  standards,  and  operational  performance. \nCorporate  decisions  and  operational  performance  will  be  publicly  disclosed  to  enhance \ntransparency and accountability to customers. Evidence shows that such companies in Pakistan \ndeliver  more  reliable  urban  services.10  Upon  establishment  of  the  new  companies,  the \nGovernment of Punjab will enter into agreements11 with these companies to transfer government \n                                                \n8  Government of Punjab, Planning and Development Department. 2013. Medium Term Development Framework, \n2013\u201316. Chandigarh. \n9  ADB. 2016. Medium Term Integrated Climate Resilient Urban Infrastructure Investment Program and Prefeasibility \nStudy. Consultant\u2019s report. Manila (TA8556-REG). \n10 Cities of Abbottabad, Kohat, Mardan, among other cities, have set up new urban service companies that have taken \nover municipal services from respective city governments. The new companies have contributed to deliver more \nreliable and sustainable urban services in these cities.      \n11 The Government of Punjab, with ADB-funded consultants, prepared Services and Asset Management Agreements \nin July 2017. The Government of Punjab is currently preparing for the establishment of the new companies. These \ncompanies will be established in 2018.    \n \n ", "  3 \nowned urban infrastructure and assets. These companies will deliver urban services through \nmanaging various service contracts.   \n9.  Choice of cities. The Government of Punjab is closely working with various development \npartners  that  are  supporting  urban  infrastructure  development,  reforms,  and  capacity \ndevelopment in the province.12 The World Bank supports five large cities in Punjab (Faisalabad, \nGujranwala,  Lahore,  Multan,  and  Rawalpindi).  In  March  2014,  the  Government  of  Punjab \nrequested ADB to finance a new urban sector project covering two intermediate cities (Sahiwal, \nand Sialkot) that are strategically important but not covered by the World Bank project.13 These \ncities have also been proposed due to their proximity to the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, \nwhich provides greater economic opportunities for increased trade and regional cooperation. They \nalso represent a mix of socioeconomic growth models, ranging from well-established industrial \ncities (e.g. Sialkot) to cities that grew from rural agricultural centers to major service centers (e.g. \nSahiwal). Sahiwal and Sialkot are also selected due to good project readiness and the timely \ncompletion of the urban sector assessment (footnote 9) that highlights: (i) improvement of \nmunicipal infrastructure, and (ii) institutional strengthening and capacity development, as key \npriorities for making the two cities more livable and sustainable. \n \n10.  Lessons learned. Lessons learned from previous urban sector projects supported by \nADB in Pakistan indicate, among others, the need to (i) link infrastructure development with robust \ninstitutional strengthening and reforms, supported by capacity development; (ii) avoid complex \nimplementation arrangements; (iii) have fewer subprojects and locations for ease of project \nimplementation; (iv) work with cities that have strong political will to implement reforms; and \n(v) establish clear service standards for effective outsourcing. A project preparatory technical \nassistance (footnote 1) has supported the needed institutional reforms with the formation of an \nurban services company in each city. Prepaid water meters will be pilot tested as an innovative \napproach, along with activities to build awareness of the dividends of clean drinking water and \nsanitation services to improve the population\u2019s willingness to pay for the services. Nonrevenue \nwater will be reduced by upgrading or replacing infrastructure and enhancing O&M capacity to \nlocate  and  rectify  system  leakages.  Cost  recovery  tariffs  will  be  introduced  with  targeted \nsubsidies, where required, to ensure the long-term sustainability of services. \n \n11.  ADB\u2019s value addition.  In addition to the financing it provides, ADB facilitates access to \na wealth of knowledge, technologies, and international best practices. Major value additions are \nsummarized below: \n(i)  Institutional reform and formation of new urban services companies. The \nGovernment of Punjab, with ADB\u2019s support, has developed two reform actions \nincluding: (a) time-bound financing sustainability action plan14 that entails ten \nactions ranging from consumer surveys, tariff policy development, and awareness \ncampaign; and (b) formation of the new urban services companies that will provide \nmore reliable municipal services with improved corporate governance structure \n(para.8).  Operational  efficiency  and  sustainability  will  be  improved  with  the \nimplementation of these reform actions.  \n                                                \n12 Key development partners implementing urban sector projects include the World Bank, the Department for \nInternational Development of the United Kingdom, and Japan International Cooperation Agency. The Asian \nInfrastructure Investment Bank may open a new resident mission in Pakistan, and may implement urban sector \nprojects in Punjab. \n13 The project is aligned with ADB. 2015. Pakistan: Country Partnership Strategy (2015\u20132019). Manila. \n14 Financial sustainability action plan will be implemented as defined in the Project Administration Manual (accessible \nfrom the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).   \n \n ", "4   \n(ii)  Innovations and international best practice. The project will introduce several \ninnovations such as prepaid water metering for effective commercial user-fee \ncollection  and  an  inclusive  green  city  approach  that  combines  infrastructure \ndevelopment with climate change resilience and disaster risk management. For \ninstance, river bank improvement is designed to combine public green space with \nflood management features. Another example is street management to improve \nconditions for all competing street users including pedestrians and all modes of \ntransport while also improving green urban environment.  Bus terminals in both \ncities will also adopt international best practice (para. 15).       \n(iii)  Pro-poor focus. Access to clean water, sanitation, and urban public spaces is \nvital to all residents irrespective of socioeconomic status. Civil works to improve \nwater distribution networks, such as new boreholes and pipe connection, will target \nspecial distribution network zones which are inhabited by those vulnerable groups.  \nImprovement on parks, streets, and greenbelts will also be prioritized in the above \nnetwork zones. The selected special distribution network zones include Azam \nBlock, Farid Town, Tariq Bin Ziad Colony, and other areas in the two cities. \n(iv)  Capacity development support. Based on the robust training needs assessment \ncarried out by the project, a capacity development program was prepared. The \nprogram will support: (a) a specialized program focused on technical engineering \nand operational aspects; and (b) a management program that addresses project \nmanagement, tariff policy, customer services, and other general administration.  \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n12.  The project is aligned with the following impact: living standards, health, and economy in \nSahiwal and Sialkot improved.15 The project will have the following outcome: access to quality \nurban services by the residents of Sahiwal and Sialkot cities improved.16 \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n13.  Output  1:  Water  supply  systems  improved.  This  will  be  achieved  through  the \ninstallation and rehabilitation of 114 boreholes and tube wells (Sahiwal-19; Sialkot-95); 22 water \nreservoirs (Sahiwal-12; Sialkot-10); 20 water pumping stations (Sahiwal-8; Sialkot-12); about 350 \nkilometers (km) of water pipes (Sahiwal-54 km; Sialkot-312 km); up to 15,000 metered customer \nconnections (Sahiwal-6,400; Sialkot-8,800), 1,400 of which will be piloting prepaid meters; and \nnew supervisory control and data administration (SCADA) systems. \n \n14.  Output 2: Sanitation systems improved. This will be achieved through the installation \nof 18 sewage pumping stations (Sahiwal-10; Sialkot-8), replacement of about 41 km of sewer \npipes (Sahiwal-11 km; Sialkot-30 km), provision of equipment for wastewater management, \nunblocking of local drains, and construction of a centralized wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) \nin Sahiwal. Equipment will also be procured for improved collection and segregation of solid \nwastes. \n \n15.  Output  3:  Urban  public  spaces  improved.  This  will  be  achieved  through  the \nrehabilitation of 11 parks (Sahiwal-6; Sialkot-5), three greenbelts (Sahiwal-2; Sialkot-1), footpaths, \nriverbank paths, streets, and three bus terminals (Sahiwal-2; Sialkot-1) that are critical hubs for \n                                                \n15 Government of Punjab, Planning and Development Department. 2015.

Local vendors and companies will expand new business opportunities \nwith the upgraded bus terminal facilities. New bus terminal buildings will also be equipped with \nnew  platforms,  ticketing  offices,  tourist  information  centers,  passenger  amenities  including \nconcourse, cafeterias, and accessibility for differently abled persons.      \n \n16.  Output 4: Institutional support and capacity developed. This will be achieved through \nsupport  to  institutional  reforms  such  as  the  establishment  of  urban  services  standards, \nenhancement of the customer service function, and development of new tariff structures. Various \ncapacity development programs\u2014including O&M of key urban services, urban planning, project \nmanagement, and tariff policy\u2014will also be delivered to relevant staff in the government and the \nurban service companies. This output will also promote behavior changes in hygiene practice and \nenvironment through partnership with youth groups and civil society organizations.  \n \nD.

DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical  \n \n22.  A detailed feasibility assessment and preliminary design of the proposed civil works \ncomponents were undertaken for the project using an integrated urban planning approach. The \nproject components and project sites were selected through consultations with stakeholders and \ncommunities, building on lessons learned (paras. 9 and 10). A geographic information system-\nbased map was prepared for each city, indicating project sites and their interconnectivity.  Each \nproject component designed for each city allows for achieving independent results, in most cases \nwithout the risk of delay or lack of completion of other project components. For Sahiwal, the \nWWTP and drainage systems were designed in coordination with the Environment, Natural \nResources and Agriculture Division of ADB\u2019s Central and West Asia Department as the division \nis preparing a new project for water quality in irrigation systems that will be linked with the WWTP \noperations  (output  2).  A  climate  change  vulnerability  assessment  was  conducted,  which \nconfirmed  the  project\u2019s  medium  climate  risk  categorization,  and  mitigation  actions  were \nincorporated  in  the  project  design.  The  project  adopts  good  practices  to  improve  project \nsustainability and impact. For example, prepaid water metering systems will be introduced to \nmake service delivery more equitable and sustainable. With the prepaid water metering system, \ncollection efficiencies will be improved for sustainable services.  \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n \n23.  The economic analysis of the project was conducted in accordance with ADB\u2019s guidelines \nfor the economic analysis of projects.18 A project is considered feasible when the economic \ninternal rate of return (EIRR) equals or exceeds the social discount rate of 9.0%. The analysis \nshows that the project components will have major quantifiable and nonquantifiable benefits, \nincluding (i) incremental water consumption and time savings from water collection (output 1), \n(ii) health benefits from improved sanitation (outputs 1 and 2), (iii) travel time savings and \nreduction of traffic accidents as a result of reduced congestion and more efficient bus terminal \noperations (output 3), (iv) reduction of flood risks owing to riverbank path improvement (output 3), \nand (v) an average rental price increase near greenbelts and parks (output 3). The estimated \nEIRR is 11.7% for Sahiwal and 21.6% for Sialkot, which is higher than the economic opportunity \ncost of capital estimated at 9.0%. The overall project has an EIRR of 17.1%. \n24.  The cities of Sahiwal and Sialkot have not introduced comprehensive cost recovery tariffs \nfor key municipal services. The fiscal capacity of both cities to finance the operating costs of the \nproject was assessed. The urban sector assessment indicates that the two cities require about \n                                                \n18 ADB. 2003. Economic Analysis of Projects. Operations Manual. OM G1/OP. Manila; and ADB. 2017. Guidelines for \nthe Economic Analysis of Projects. Manila. \n ", "8   \n$6 million in incremental annual operating costs, which will be provided as revenue grants through \nbudgetary transfers from the provincial government. While the financial sustainability of urban \nservices may still depend on budgetary transfers, the above transfers are expected to reduce over \ntime with the following measures. First, the two cities will introduce new tariff structures to improve \nfinancial  and  operational  sustainability.  Consultation  with  communities  confirmed  people\u2019s \nwillingness to support and pay for improved services, and the viability of introducing a new tariff \nscheme. Second, the revenue innovation, through the installation of about 15,000 water meters \n(of which 1,400 are prepaid water meters) in the two cities as well as the introduction of volumetric \ntariffs, is expected to result in a reduction of about 10% in nonrevenue water.  Prepaid meters will \nalso improve the collection of fees for water use. Third, investment in a bus terminal will increase \nthe revenue from fees levied on buses, and a portion of the increased revenue in bus terminal \noperation  will  be  transferred  to  the  newly  established  urban  services  companies.  These \ncompanies will also provide maintenance and clearing services to the bus terminals, which will \ngenerate revenue for the companies. \n \nC.  Governance \n \n25.  The pre-mitigation financial management and procurement risks are assessed to be \nsubstantial for the executing and implementing agencies. In financial management, the executing \nand  implementing  agencies  follow  a  single-entry  accounting  system;  an  adequate  asset \nmanagement system and effective internal audit mechanism are not in place. Mitigation measures \nproposed include the appointment of key financial management personnel, development of a \nfinancial policies and procedures manual, and outsourcing of the internal audit function in the \nPMU and CIUs. Regarding procurement, the executing agency needs to appoint a suitable \nprocurement staff to ensure all procurement decisions follow ADB\u2019s operating principles, including \neconomy and efficiency, fairness, and transparency. The executing agency will follow these \nprocurement principles embodied in ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2015, as amended from time \nto time). ADB will also provide training on ADB procurement and disbursement procedures. \n \n26.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith LG&CD Department, the Planning and Development Department, and the Urban Unit. The \nspecific policy requirements and supplementary measures are described in the PAM. \n \nD.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n27.  The project will benefit about 1.4 million people in Sahiwal and Sialkot cities, of which an \nestimated  29.5%  are  poor.  It  will  contribute  to  poverty  reduction  in the  two  cities through \n(i) improved water supply and sanitation services, which will reduce the incidence of waterborne \ndiseases  and thus  household  health  expenses; (ii)  upgraded  urban transport  infrastructure \nincluding well-lit pedestrian walkways, and space for small vendors which will largely benefit the \npoor and low-income groups; (iii) increased functionality of public spaces and bus terminals, which \nwill provide economic opportunities for small vendors and increase the use of outdoor spaces for \nhealthy activities; (iv) increased public awareness of hygiene and waterborne diseases; and \n(v) additional employment opportunities for the local labor force.  \n \n28.  The project is categorized effective gender mainstreaming, with significant direct benefits \nfor women, including (i) the development of gender-inclusive urban infrastructure such as bus \nterminals with separate female toilets and the allocation of more commercial spaces for female \nvendors, well-lit pedestrian walkways, and women\u2019s facilities in the parks; and (ii) improvement of \ngender-inclusive urban service delivery through the recruitment of more female staff in customer \nservice units and policy divisions of the urban services companies. \n ", "  9 \nE.  Safeguards \n \n29.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project\u2019s safeguard \ncategories are as follows. \n \n30.  Environment  (category  B).  Impacts  from  the  project  are  mostly  related  to  the \nconstruction and rehabilitation of the trunk mains, distribution centers, and distribution networks; \nand are expected to be short-term and limited. These include dust, noise, vibration, labor and \npublic safety issues, temporary blockage of household access, traffic disturbance, production and \ntransportation  of  construction  materials,  and  disposal  of  hazardous  construction  waste. \nEnvironmental impacts during the operation phase may include lowering of the groundwater table, \ndisposal of WWTP sludge, accidental leakage from chlorination, noise from the WWTP and \npumping stations, and increase in wastewater production. Mitigation measures to address all \nconstruction and operational impacts have been included in the environmental management plans \nprepared as part of the initial environmental examinations. The initial environmental examinations \nwere disclosed on the ADB website on 7 April 2017. The PMU in the LG&CD Department will be \nresponsible for implementation of the environmental management plan. A grievance redress \nmechanism to handle safeguard issues will be established after project effectiveness. \n \n31.  Involuntary resettlement (category A). For output 1, the due diligence report shows that \nlimited involuntary resettlement impacts are expected since project imprints are largely within the \nright-of-way. Impacts will be reassessed based on detailed designs and additional land acquisition \nand resettlement plans (LARPs) will be prepared as needed. For output 2, a LARP has been \nprepared and disclosed19 for Sahiwal WWTP and its conveyance system. Land acquisition for the \nWWTP and conveyance system will affect about 23 landowners who will lose about 5.6 hectares \nof arable land, about 50 mobile vendors, and 143 displaced persons operating commercial \nstructures. Additional assessments may be required for some components under this subproject \nbased on detailed designs. For output 3, the due diligence report shows that limited involuntary \nresettlement impacts are expected for parks and greenbelts, but impacts will be reassessed \nbased on detailed designs and LARPs will be developed as needed. Output 4 has no involuntary \nresettlement impacts. All draft LARPs will be updated based on detailed designs, approved by \nADB, and disclosed before implementation. A land acquisition and resettlement framework has \nbeen additionally prepared and disclosed20 to guide the planning and implementation of social \nsafeguards, as additional assessment may be required. Institutional capacity building will be \nprovided to support the Punjab PMU and two CIUs in safeguards implementation through the \nproject management consultant. A notice to proceed will not be given to contractors until LARPs \nhave been implemented for each subproject. \n \n32.  Indigenous peoples (category C). No communities of indigenous peoples are in the \nproject area, as defined in ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) for operational purposes. \nAccordingly, no indigenous peoples planning documents are required. \n \nF.  Summary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n \n33.  Significant risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in \ndetail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.21 \n \n                                                \n19 The LARP for Sahiwal Centralized Sewerage Treatment Plant with Trunk Mains and Conveyance System was \ndisclosed on the ADB website on 18 April 2017. \n20 The project land acquisition resettlement framework was disclosed on ADB website on 18 April 2017. \n21 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "10   \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nInfrastructure needs may change  ADB will continue dialogue with relevant stakeholders throughout project \nover years due to change of political  implementation to ensure commitment and support by any political leadership. \nleaderships. \nCapacity development and  ADB will closely monitor progress.
