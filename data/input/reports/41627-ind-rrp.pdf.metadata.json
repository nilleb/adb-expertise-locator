Conversely, the \nshare of fossil-fuel burning power generation has increased. India\u2019s \neconomy  has  grown  by  8%  per  annum  in  recent  years,  and  the \ncountry  faces  rapidly  growing  energy  needs.  Addressing  the \nenergy  challenge  is  essential  for  fostering  sustainable  economic \ngrowth and reducing poverty. \n \nThe  Himachal  Pradesh  Clean  Energy  Development  Investment \nProgram \nin \nin  Himachal  Pradesh  with \nhydroelectric  power  generation \nnonphysical interventions in capacity development. All hydropower \nprojects  will  be  run-of-river  design.  The  capacity  development \ncomponent  will  help  the  principal  Implementing  Agency  (IA)  (i) \nprepare  future  projects;  (ii)  implement  and  administer  approved \nprojects; and (iii) monitor, review, evaluate, and report on program \nand  project  implementation,  particularly  in  regard  to  compliance \nwith ADB policies and procedures. Additional support will focus on \nfinancial management and accountability, as well as other aspects \nof  corporate  development  of  the  IA  and  support  for  other  state \npower sector entities. \n \nthe \nSector  Road  Map. \ngovernment  of  Himachal  Pradesh  (GOHP)  opted  to  target  its \ncomparative advantage in hydropower as the key focal point of the \nstate  power  sector,  with  planned  investments  in  installed  capacity \nbacked  by  institutional  reforms  and  capacity  development.  GOHP \nhas  outlined  a  policy  agenda  for  hydropower  development  in  the \nshort  to  medium  term  and  has  developed  a  comprehensive  road \nmap  to  achieve  these  goals  efficiently.  A  main  pillar  of  the  road \nmap  is  hydropower  project  implementation  by  the  state,  central \ngovernment,  and  private  sectors,  as  well  as  providing  enabling \ntransmission \ninfrastructure \n\n(the  Program)  combines  physical \n\nits  hydropower  policy \n\ninvestments \n\n(2006), \n\naccess \n\nsuch \n\nroad \n\nand \n\nas \n\nIn \n\n \nBorrower \n \nClassification \n\n \nEnvironment \nAssessment \n\n \nBackground \n\n \nInvestment Program \nDescription \n\n \n\n \n\n\fii \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\ninterconnections  to  facilitate  hydropower  development.  The  road \nmap  also  includes  institutional  changes  and  stipulates  formulating \npolicies and guidelines to assist the sector. \n \nInvestment  Plan.  The  state\u2019s  overall  hydropower  development \nplan aims to achieve 4,021.5 MW of installed hydropower capacity \nby the end of the 11th Five Year Plan in 2012 as follows. \n\nSector \nState Sector \nCentral  Government \nand/or Joint Sector b \nPrivate Sector \n\n \n\nInstalled  \nCapacity  \n(MW) \n     290.5 a \n2,243.0 \n\n1,488.0 \n\nEstimated \nCost \n($ million) \n\n493 \n3,813 \n\n2,462 \n\n \n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n\n6,768 \n\n4,021.5 \n\n      Total \nMW = megawatt. \na This figure reflects projects commissioned during the 11th Five Year Plan only. \n632  MW  of  the  808  total  MW  intended  to  be  funded  under  the  Investment \nProgram are scheduled for commissioning post 2012. \nb  This  includes  projects  developed  either  by  Central  Government  power  sector \nentities alone or jointly with either state or private sector entities. \nSource: Government of Himachal Pradesh. Estimated costs are based on general \n$ per kilowatt cost assumptions. \n \nThe Program\u2019s selected projects will come from the state\u2019s portion \nof  the  overall  hydropower  development  plan,  which  includes  an \nadditional 810 MW to be commissioned post-2012. \n \nCapacity  Development. Given the considerable investment plans \nfor additional hydropower additions in Himachal Pradesh, there are \ncapacity  development  needs  within  Himachal  Pradesh  Power \nCorporation  Ltd.  (HPPCL),  the  state\u2019s  hydropower  generating \ncompany  established  in  2006.  GOHP  owns  60%  of  HPPCL  and \nHimachal  Pradesh  State  Electricity  Board  (HPSEB),  the  state\u2019s \nutility,  owns  40%.  HPPCL  has  sound  engineering  and  project \nconstruction management capabilities, and borrows expertise from \nits parent (one of the better run state utilities). The main goal is to \nensure complete stand-alone capabilities within HPPCL. Identified \ncapacity  development  objectives  of  the  proposed  multitranche \nfinancing  facility  (MFF)  include  a  focus  on  project  preparation, \nimplementation,  and  management,  including  (i)  helping  prepare \nfuture  projects,  (ii) implementing  and  administering  approved \nprojects,  and  (iii)  monitoring,  reviewing,  evaluating,  and  reporting \non  program  and  project  implementation.  Particular  emphasis  will \nbe  placed  on  adherence  to  ADB  policies,  procedures,  and \ncontract  management, \nreporting \nprocurement,  disbursements, \ncompliance  and \nmonitoring  and  reporting  systems,  as  well  as  support  for  project \nplanning  and  construction  supervision.  It  will  also  emphasize \nadherence to the national laws, policies and requirements. \n \n\nrequirements\u2014including \n\nsafeguards \n\n\f \n\niii\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFinancial  management  and  accountability  will  be  a  second  major \nfocus.  Capacity  currently  exists  for  accounting  for  construction \noperations,  but  when  the  first  subproject  begins  generating \nrevenue in 2011, the financial management and accounting needs \nwill  change.  Improved  accounting  and  auditing  systems,  while \nincorporating adequate financial management standards to ensure \nfiduciary oversight of disbursed funds, will commence in 2008.  \n \nIn  addition  to  project-oriented  capacity  development,  the  capacity \ndevelopment  component  will \ninclude  corporate  development \nassistance  to  HPPCL  to  broaden  its  functional  expertise  as  the \nstate\u2019s  power  generating  company.  Developing  HPPCL  into  a \ncorporatized  generation  company,  separate  from  HPSEB,  the \nstate\u2019s current integrated utility, facilitates the unbundling process. \nThis  component  will  address  HPPCL\u2019s  training  needs  in  state-of-\nthe-art  technologies,  and  for  capacity  in  clean  development \nmechanism (CDM) procedures.  \n \nA  separate  capacity  development  subcomponent  will  support \nHPSEB.  As  the  state\u2019s  transmission  utility,  HPSEB  is  responsible \nfor  the  design  and  construction  of  evacuation  systems  from \nhydropower  projects  to  the  transmission  system,  as  well  as \nensuring  adequate  transmission  capacity.  ADB  will  assist  HPSEB \nin  acquiring  an  enterprise  resource  solution  to  cover  all  its  future \ncomputer  accounting  and  management  information  system  (MIS) \napplications; and in financing the purchase of software, hardware, \ntraining,  and  initial  system  maintenance  to  improve  management \nreporting and operating activities. ADB is also considering assisting \nHPSEB  with  its  transmission  system  master  plan  separately  from \nthis MFF (with technical assistance preparation in progress). \n \nHimachal Pradesh Power Sector. The power sector of Himachal \nPradesh ranked 7th out of 29 in a state power sector performance \nrating study mandated by the Government. Key aspects evaluated \nto  determine  the  ratings  were  state  governments\u2019  progress  in \nimplementing the key provisions of the Electricity Act, 2003, and in \nobtaining rural electrification; the quality of the regulatory process; \nbusiness  and \nin  attaining \ncommercial viability; and the creation of a competitive environment. \nNoted  strengths \ninclude  satisfactory \nprogress  in  the  area  of  distribution  reforms,  particularly  metering \nand  energy  accounting,  and  achievement  of  100%  rural  and \nconsumer electrification. Himachal Pradesh is one of the few states \nwhere  energy  delivered  to  consumers  is  100%  metered,  and  its \ndistribution system has a high 97.4% availability. \n  \nHimachal  Pradesh  has  achieved  more  than  90%  metering  of  its \ndistribution  transformers  and  on  feeders  up  to  33  kilovolts  (kV), \nresulting in transmission and distribution losses of a comparatively \nlow  16.4%,  and  aggregate  technical  and  commercial  losses  of \nabout  26%.  Also  noted  were  (i)  a  strong  regulatory  process, \n\nrisk  analysis;  progress \n\nfor  Himachal  Pradesh \n\nfinancial \n\n \n\n\fiv \n\n \n\nincluding timely issuance of tariff orders and regular monitoring of \nperformance  standards  and  compliance;  and  (ii) significant  steps \ntaken  to  implement  various  provisions  of  the  Electricity  Act,  2003. \nThe  state\u2019s  independent  regulator,  Himachal  Pradesh  Electricity \nRegulatory  Commission  (HPERC),  began  issuing  tariff  orders  in \nOctober  2001.  The  main  features  of  its  tariff  orders  are  the \nadoption  of  a  cost-to-serve  model  for  tariff  determination  to \nrationalize  tariffs  across  various  consumer  categories,  reducing \ncross  subsidies,  and  introducing  tariff-based  incentives  to  reduce \ntransmission and distribution losses further. \n \nHimachal  Pradesh  is  a  small  mountainous  state  with  abundant \nwater  resources  in  the  five  major  rivers  flowing  through  the  state \nfrom  the  western  Himalayas.  The  power  generation  potential  of \nHimachal  Pradesh  is  20,415  MW\u2014about  25%  of  India\u2019s  total \nhydropower  potential\u2014out  of  which  about  6,150  MW  has  been \ndeveloped.  Recognizing  the  state\u2019s  comparative  advantage  in \nhydropower  generation,  the  main  strategy  of  GOHP  is  the \ndevelopment  of  Himachal  Pradesh  as  the  \u201chydropower  state\u201d  of \nIndia.  Harnessing  this  hydropower  is  vital  to  meet  all  in-state \ndemand  by  providing  affordable,  reliable  power  to  its  residents  as \nthe  state  currently  meets  only  about  50%  of  its  power  demand \nthrough  its  own  power  generating  capacity.  Harnessing  this \nhydropower will also enable the export of excess power to the rest \nof the country for the benefit of poorer and power deficient states. \nHimachal  Pradesh\u2019s  focus  on  clean  energy  development  will \nprovide jobs to state residents and will further the country\u2019s goal of \nmeeting  its  energy  needs  through  clean,  indigenous  sources. \nFurthermore,  the  Program  will  meet  capacity  development  needs \nto further improve the state\u2019s power sector. \n \nImpact. The impact of the Program will be a sustainable electricity \nsector in Himachal Pradesh and improved state finances. \n \nOutcome.  The  outcome  of  the  program  will  be  increased  clean \nenergy  production  through  run-of-river  hydropower  schemes,  as \nwell  as  improved  planning,  implementation,  management  and \npower sector governance.  \n \nThe Program\u2019s selected projects will come from the state\u2019s portion \nof  the  overall  hydropower  development  plan  and  are  expected  to \ntotal about 808 MW. The estimated cost of these selected projects \nis about $1.5 billion. \n \n\n \nRationale \n\n \nImpact and Outcome \n\n \nProgram Investment \nPlan  \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \nFinancing Plan \n\n \nMultitranche Financing \nFacility \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFinancing Plan for the Investment Program \n($ million) \n\nSource \nAsian Development Bank \nOther Financial Institutions  \nGovernment \n\nAmount \n800.0 \n250.0 \n450.0 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n% \n53.3\n16.7\n30.0\n\n \n\nTotal \n\n \n\n1,500.0 \n\n100.0\n\nto  extend \n\nSource:  Himachal  Pradesh  Power  Corporation  Limited  and  Asian  Development \nBank estimates. \n \nfinancing  of \nThe  Government  has  asked  ADB \n$800 million  over  8  years  through  an  MFF.  The  MFF  supports  a \nwell-defined  clean  energy  investment  program  underpinned  by \ncontinued institutional reform and a delineated sector road map. It \nwill  allow  financing  of  individual  subprojects  as  projects  and \nconditions  warrant,  by  linking  financing  to  project  readiness  and \ncapacity.  \n \nThe MFF is a suitable modality for this Program as it allows ADB to \nengage  with  GOHP  in  a  continuous  long-term  dialogue  consistent \nwith  the  Government\u2019s  and  ADB\u2019s  clean  energy  policies,  and \nprovides up-front support to GOHP for its substantial clean energy \ndevelopment  program,  but  with  financial  commitments  sequenced \nto match project readiness. As the sequenced investments are all \nrun-of-river  hydropower  projects,  expertise  will  build  over  time, \nallowing  future  subprojects  to  benefit  directly  from  implementation \nexperience  gained  from  the  initial  investments  and  from  the \ncapacity development component. \n \nSpecific subprojects have been earmarked for the first and second \ntranches  as  well  as  future  tranches,  although  others  from  the \nstate\u2019s  investment  plan  may  be  substituted  in  future  tranches \nprovided \ntentative \nimplementation  schedule  of  the  MFF  envisages  five  tranches \ncovering  physical  investments  in  hydropower  generation  and \nnonphysical  investments  in  the  form  of  a  capacity  development \ncomponent.  \n \nThe  MFF  transaction  is  accompanied  by  the  tranche  1  periodic \nfinancing  request  (PFR)  to  finance  two  subprojects  consisting  of \nhydropower \nfor \nimplementation,  plus  the  capacity  development  component.  The \ntotal cost of the first tranche subprojects and capacity development \namounts  to  $224.8  million.  HPPCL  requested  ADB  to  provide \n$150 million  as  a  first  tranche  loan.  Due  diligence  in  key  areas, \nsuch  as  technical,  economic,  financial,  and  safeguards,  has  been \ncompleted for tranche 1. \n \n\nthe  eligibility  criteria.

Before ADB accepts a PFR under the FFA, the Government, \nGOHP, and the EA will ensure full compliance with the terms and \nconditions  of  the  FFA.  The  capacity  development  component  will \nprovide  support  if  necessary.  ADB  will  evaluate  all  funding \nrequests, and will ensure that they adhere to representations made \nand  will  continue  to  do  so.  ADB  will  provide  ongoing  guidance  to \nthe Indian authorities, and make available additional experts under \nthe  capacity  development  component  if  needed.  ADB  staff  will \nreport  to  ADB  Management  and  ADB\u2019s  Board  of  Directors  on  the \nthe  performance  on \nstatus  of \nto  comply  with \nrepresentations  and  warranties.  Failure \nrepresentations and warranties entitles ADB to hold back additional \nfinancing under the MFF. \n \nThe MFF transaction is accompanied by one PFR as tranche 1. \n \nPFR  1:  Hydropower  Facility  Construction  and  Capacity \nDevelopment. This tranche includes clean power development via \nconstruction  of  the  111  MW  Sawra  Kuddu  Hydroelectric  Project \nlocated on the Pabber river in Shimla district of Himachal Pradesh. \nConstruction  activities \ninclude  underground  powerhouses, \nassociated  civil  works,  river  diversion,  electromechanical  works, \nand power evacuation systems. This tranche also includes the civil \nworks for the 65 MW Kashang I Hydroelectric Project, including the \ncommon power house for the Kashang I, II and III Projects, located \non  tributary  streams  of  the  Sutlej  river  in  Kinnaur  district.  (The \nKashang  I  electromechanical  works  and  the  Kashang  II  and  III \nprojects  are  expected  to  be  covered  under  the  second  tranche \nsuch  that  the  Kashang  I,  II  and  III  Projects  total  195  MW.)  These \nsubprojects,  as  well  as  all  other  subprojects  earmarked  for  future \ntranches,  are  run-of-river  design.  The  first  tranche  loan  will  also \ninclude the $12 million capacity development component. \n \nThe  MFF  will  provide  up  to  $800  million  from  the  ordinary  capital \nresources of ADB, with final terms and conditions to be established \nunder  individual  loan  agreements  based  on  prevailing  ADB \npolicies.  \n \nPursuant  to  the  FFA,  the  Government  has  submitted  one  PFR  to \nADB  totaling  $150  million  for  tranche  1.  This  PFR  is  presented  to \nthe Board with the report and recommendation of the President for \nthe  MFF  and  the  FFA.  The  tranche  1  loan  will  have  a  principal \nrepayment  period  of  25  years,  which  includes  a  grace  period  of \n5 years.  However,  each  future  tranche  may  be  financed  under \nterms different from the financing terms of previous or subsequent \ntranches.

The  Government  and  GOHP  have  also \nrequested retroactive financing arrangements to apply to the MFF \nto  cover  incurred  project  expenses  in  accordance  with  ADB \nprocedures.  ADB  granted  approval  of  advance  contracting,  and \napproval \nfinancing  on  10  March  2008.  The \nGovernment, the EA and the implementing agency (IA) have been \ninformed that approval of advance action does not commit ADB to \nthe \napprove  any  of \nprocurement  costs.  Except  as  otherwise  agreed  with  ADB,  the \nexpenditures  incurred  for  equipment,  civil  works,  and  consulting \nservices  will  be  eligible  for  retroactive  financing,  provided  that \nthese  are  incurred  before  the  effectiveness  of  the  related  loan \nagreement, but not earlier than 12 months preceding the signing of \nthe related loan agreement, and as long as they do not exceed an \namount of 20% of the individual loan. The Government and the EA \nhave  been  informed  that  ADB  will  not  finance  expenditures \nincurred  prior  to  effectiveness  of  individual  tranches,  even  if \nadvance  contracting  was  approved,  unless  retroactive  financing \nhas also been approved. \n \nThe ADB-supported investment program will be implemented over \n8  years,  including  procurement  and  construction  activities.

HPPCL  was  established  by \nthe  state  government,  and  it  is  mandated  to  develop  and  operate \nnew  hydropower  plants  in  the  state.  HPPCL  will  function  as  the \n\n \n\n\fviii \n\n \n\nimplementation,  and  administration  of \n\nprincipal IA for the proposed MFF, with responsibility for the day-to-\nday  coordination, \nthe \nsubprojects. Each of the hydropower projects will have a separate \nfield office to facilitate its smooth functioning. They will function as \nproject  management  units  (PMUs)  at  the  field  level  and  there  will \nbe  a  central  PMU  within  HPPCL\u2019s  head  office.  For  the  capacity \ndevelopment subcomponent earmarked for HPSEB, HPSEB will be \nthe IA. \n \nHPPCL  will  appraise  additional  subprojects  following  approval  of \nthe MFF. HPPCL will also undertake detailed design, procurement, \nconstruction  supervision,  commissioning,  maintenance,  and \noperation  of  the  subprojects.  Technical  support  from  consultants \nand  contractors  will  be  employed  as  necessary  with  funding  from \nthe  capacity  development  component  budget.  HPPCL  will  liaise \nwith ADB on a regular basis. \n \nThe  PMU,  through  the  related  IA  offices,  will  be  responsible  for \nprocessing and implementing the subprojects. It will be assisted by \ntechnical experts who will evaluate the technical reports, feasibility \nstudies,  preliminary  design  reports,  environmental  assessment \nreports,  resettlement  and  indigenous  peoples  development  plans, \nand  detailed  design  reports  to  ensure  compliance  with  ADB  and \ngovernment  requirements.  Summary  appraisal  reports  will  be \nsubmitted  to  ADB  subsequent  to  GOHP  approval  and  necessary \ngovernment clearances.  \n \nEquipment,  materials,  and  civil  works  to  be  financed  under  each \nloan  of  the  MFF  will  be  procured  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nProcurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time), \nmainly  through  international  and/or  national  competitive  bidding. \nAdvance  procurement  will  be  allowed \ntimely \nimplementation of the investments.   \n \nConsulting  services  are  required  to  provide  support  to  HPPCL  for \nproject  implementation  work,  including  design,  supervision  of \nconstruction, management for the subprojects under the tranche 1 \nloan, and for feasibility studies of future loans. Consulting services \nwill be provided for evaluation, monitoring, and reporting purposes. \nIn  addition,  consultants  will  support \nthe  capacity  building \ncomponent under the tranche 1 loan. Consultants will be selected \nand  engaged  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  Consulting \nfirms  will  be  selected  using  the  quality-  and  cost-based  selection \nmethod  and  simplified  technical  proposal.  Individual  experts  may \nalso  be  recruited  based  on  biodata  submitted  in  response  to \nspecific terms of reference for assignments. \n \nThe  first  group  of  beneficiaries  will  be  local  electricity  consumers. \nElectricity \nthe \nInvestment  Program  will  go  directly  to  the  local  grid  (only  the \n\nthe  proposed  hydropower  plants  under \n\nfacilitate \n\nfrom \n\nto \n\n \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\n \n\n \n\n \nProcurement \n\n \nConsulting Services \n\n \nBenefits and \nBeneficiaries under the \nMFF \n\n\f \n\nix\n\nsurplus  will be  exported  to  the  national  grid),  thus  helping  to  fulfill \nlocal  demand  for  greater  energy  resources.  Power  consumption \nwithin  the  state  consists  of  about  25%  domestic  users,  7% \ncommercial users, 59% industrial or bulk supply, and 9% irrigation \nand agricultural use. The MFF is expected to result in more reliable \npower to consumers, and will lower the cost of supplying power in \nthe state by relying more on in-state power generation. Industry is \nthe  largest  consumer  of  electricity  in  Himachal  Pradesh,  and  the \nshare  of  industry  to  state  domestic  product  has  increased  from \n1.1%  in  FY1951  to  15.9%  in  FY2004.  As  the  dust-free  and  cool \nclimate  of  Himachal  Pradesh  is  suitable  for  the  electronic  and \nprecision  industries,  electronic  complexes  have  been  established. \nThese  industries  are  expected  to  benefit  from  rationalized  power \ntariffs.  \n \nThe second group of beneficiaries will be through job creation as a \nresult of the Investment Program. For example, the contractors are \nexpected to hire skilled and unskilled workers for the projects\u2019 civil \nworks.  There  will  also  be  jobs  available  beyond  the  construction \nphase throughout the projects\u2019 life cycles. GOHP has a policy that \n70% of hired labor must be hired from within the state. \n \nThird,  local  communities  in  the  project  areas  will  benefit  from \nsocioeconomic  development  programs  financed  through  GOHP\u2019s \npolicy  of  allocating  1.5%  of  total  project  costs  to  the  community, \nwith  the  funds  to  be  administered  by  local  area  development \ncommittees  led  by  community  leaders  (these  are  government \nfunds  outside  of  the  MFF).  These  funds  will  be  earmarked  for \nthe  affected  communities  as \nsmall-scale  projects  benefiting \ndecided by the committees. \n \nClean energy development as promoted by this MFF will contribute \nto  local,  regional,  and  global  environmental  initiatives.  In  addition, \nthe  Program  will  benefit  all  national  grid-connected  electricity \nconsumers  via  the  export  of  excess  power,  and  by  eliminating  or \nreducing the need for Himachal Pradesh to import power from the \nnational grid, thus enabling the Government to meet its objective of \ndeveloping the hydropower potential in the country. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nRisks and Assumptions  The  key  broad  assumptions  under  the  Program  are  as  follows: \n(i) macroeconomic  growth  will  remain  stable;  (ii)  GOHP  remains \ncommitted  to  power  sector  reforms  and  institutional  improvement; \nand  (iii)  GOHP  executes \ninvestment  plan,  successfully \ncombining  physical  infrastructure  investments  with  nonphysical \ninvestments  in  capacity  development  to  maintain  a  sustainable \npower  sector.  Broad  risks  to  the  Investment  Program  include  a \nslowdown  in  the  depth  and  pace  of  policy  and  sector  reforms, \nincluding \nfinancial \nmanagement, institutional change, and tariff regimes. \n \nThese  risks  can  be  mitigated  through  political  commitment, \n\nregulation,  governance, \n\nrelated \n\nthose \n\nits \n\nto \n\n \n\n \n\n\fx \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nUndertakings \n\n \n\ntariff \n\nfurther \n\nreform, \n\ninclude \n\nconcerted action, and sound supervision. GOHP is fully committed \nto expand its power supply and continue with sector reforms. The \nreforms \nimproved  corporate \ngovernance,  institutional  change,  and  increased  private  sector \nparticipation.  The  state  is  closely  following  the  execution  of  the \nlong-  and  medium-term  plans  for  the  sector,  where  hydropower \ndevelopment  has  a  prominent  role,  and  recognizes  that  capacity \ndevelopment  is  a  major  part  of  the  process.  GOHP  is  also \ncommitted  to  the  adequate  development  of  the  transmission \nnetwork  in  the  state,  for  which  a  separate  transmission  utility  has \nbeen envisaged.  \n \nMore  specific,  subproject-related  assumptions  under  the  Program \nare:  (i)  the  commitment  of  HPPCL  to  construct  and  operate  the \nhydropower  projects  in  a  timely  manner  and  maintain  proper \nimplementation supervision, including implementation of safeguard \nplans;  (ii)  no  material  delay  in  concluding  tariffs  for  the  projects \nand/or on appropriate arrangements for the sale of excess power; \n(iii)  GOHP  continues \nto  support  capacity  development  and \nassumes  ownership  of  the  proposed  MFF\u2019s  capacity  development \ncomponent;  and  (iv)  the  subprojects  will  be  eligible  for  CDM \nfinancing  (purchase  of  carbon  credits)  and  the  CDM  is  extended \nbeyond its 2012 end date.  \n \nin  recruiting \nSpecific  subproject-related  risks \nconsultants  and  in  the  procurement  process.  Another  risk  is  the \nlack of, or delay in, counterpart funding including funds to the state \ntransmission  utility \ntransmission \nfor  construction  of \ninterconnections  and  required  transmission  lines.  Construction \nrisks  include  an  increase  in  project  costs  and  the  implementation \ntime  frame  caused  by  (i)  implementation  issues  (the  greatest  risk \nbeing due to encountering unexpected poor geological conditions); \n(ii)  commodity  price  increases  (such  as  cement,  steel,  fuel,  and \nother  raw  materials)  that  affect  cost  estimates;  or  (iii)  poor \ncontractor  performance.  However, \nthe  structures  are  of \nconventional  design  and  require  special  but  common  construction \npractices,  and  the  equipment  is  of  conventional  design  and \nmanufacturing  capability.  In  all,  the  works  require  highly  qualified \ncivil  works  contractors  and  equipment  manufactures.  This  can  be \nachieved \nfor \nqualification of contractors and consultants and close monitoring of \nthe contracts.  \n \nOverall,  the  integrated  benefits  and  impacts  are  expected  to \noutweigh the costs, given the likelihood of the risks occurring. \n \nHimachal  Pradesh  has  a  well-defined  power  sector  road  map,  a \nclear  investment  and  capacity  development  program,  and  the \npeople and institutions to deliver on the objectives and targets. The \nprovision  of  ADB  finance  through  an  MFF  requires  an  agreement \non  key  undertakings,  which  are  intended  to  ensure  program \n\nthrough  rigid  application  of  ADB\u2019s  guidelines \n\ninclude  delays \n\nthe \n\n\f \n\nxi\n\nframeworks; \n\nsuccess. The assurances outlined in this document are reflected in \nlegal  documentation,  covering  critical  covenants,  including  (i) \nproper  implementation  and  evaluation,  (ii) providing  its  share  of \nfinancing  according  to  the  financing  plan,  (iii) proper  fiduciary \noversight  (including  financial  as  well  as  business  process  audits), \n(iv) proper governance measures, and (v) capacity and institutional \ndevelopment.  In  addition,  the  FFA  captures  provisions  for  ADB \nfinancing,  including  (i)  subproject  eligibility  criteria;  (ii)  following \n(iii) procurement  and  disbursement \nsafeguards \nprocedures;  (iv) \nfinancial  management;  and  (v)  monitoring, \nadministration, and reporting.  \n \nADB will provide support to the EA and IA responsible for program \nimplementation, from headquarters and potentially through the India \nResident Mission.   \n \nEach  new  financing  request  to  be  converted  into  a  new  loan  will \nrequire an evaluation of the performance of the previous one. ADB \nwill  conduct  periodic  review  missions,  which  will  include  due \ndiligence  on  representations  and  warranties  made  to  ADB.  In \naddition,  staff  will  report  on  any  issues  or  problems  faced  by  the \nauthorities  and  the  EA,  and  the  remedial  actions  suggested  to \novercome them. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f\f \n\n \n\n\f\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n1. \nI  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  report  and  recommendation  on  a  proposed \nmultitranche  financing  facility  (MFF)  to  India  for  the  Himachal  Pradesh  Clean  Energy \nDevelopment Investment Program.1  \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nA. \n\nBackground, Performance Indicators, and Analysis \n\n2. \nIndia\u2019s economy has grown by 8% per annum in recent years, and faces rapidly growing \nenergy needs. Addressing the energy challenge is essential for fostering sustainable economic \ngrowth  and  reducing  poverty.  Taking  into  account  India\u2019s  energy  security  concerns  and  the \nenvironment,  the  Government  of  India  (the  Government)  developed  the  integrated  energy \npolicy 2 in  2006.  The  policy\u2019s  goal  is  to  ensure  adequate  and  reliable  energy  supplies  in  a \ntechnically  efficient,  economically  viable,  and  environmentally  sustainable  manner.  Specific \nmeasures  include  (i) optimizing  the  power  supply  mix,  including  greater  use  of  indigenous \nhydropower  resources and  renewable  energy;  (ii)  pursuing  technologies  that  maximize  energy \nefficiency,  demand-side  management,  and  conservation;  and  (iii)  continuing  related  power \nsector  reforms,  including  reducing  technical  and  commercial  losses  of  the  state  transmission \nand distribution utilities and other restructuring efforts.  \n \n3. \nThe Electricity Act, 2003, is the cornerstone legislation for the power sector in India. The \nact  primarily  mandates  continued  restructuring  of  state  electricity  boards,  full  metering  for  all \nconsumer classes, open access to transmission systems, facilitation of power trading, and tariff \nrationalization. The Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC) has prescribed detailed \nrules  for  cost  accounting  and  allowable  tariffs.  In  addition,  India\u2019s  11th  Five  Year  Plan  (FYP) \naims  to  ensure  electricity  connections  to  all  villages  and  below  poverty  level  households  by \n2009, and provide round-the-clock power service by the end of 2012 to meet the Government\u2019s \n\u201cPower For All By 2012\u201d commitment. The 11th FYP also aims to increase generation capacity \nby  78,500  megawatts  (MW),  reduce  aggregate  technical  and  commercial  losses,  increase \nenergy efficiency, promote low-carbon energy sources, and increase private sector participation. \n \n4. \nTo  ensure  energy  security  for  the  country,  India  has  decided  to  fully  develop  all \ndomestically  available  energy  options.  Though  India  has  abundant  reserves  of  coal  and  coal \nshall  remain  an  important  source  for  power  generation  in  the  medium  term,  India  has  also \ndecided to tread a low carbon path for meeting energy needs, including thermal power projects \ndeploying  more  efficient,  super  critical  technology,  gas  based  power  generation  (dependent \nupon  the  availability  and  pricing  of  gas)  and  nuclear  power  (dependent  upon  the  access  to \ncivilian nuclear technology and availability of fuel.  With about 9,000 MW of installed capacity, \nIndia is the world\u2019s 4th largest producer of wind power. To address climate change issues, India \nhas drawn up a National Action Plan, which includes solar power promotion. India is also giving \nemphasis to the conservation of energy. \n \nIndia  is  also  endowed  with  enormous  economically  viable  hydropower  potential. \n5. \nConventional hydropower capacity is assessed to be about 84,000 MW at 60% load factor (or \n140,000  MW  installed  capacity).  Only  about  21%  of  India's  hydroelectric  potential  has  been \n\n                                                 \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2   Government  of  India  Planning  Commission.  2006.  Integrated  Energy  Policy:  Report  of  the  Expert  Committee. \n\nNew Delhi. \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nharnessed  to-date  and  another  10%  is  under  development.  The  Government  recognizes  the \nimportance of increasing the share of hydropower generation in the energy mix and introduced \nthe  \u201c50,000  MW  Hydropower  Initiative\u201d  in  2003.  Under  this  initiative,  the  hydro-rich  states, \nincluding Himachal Pradesh, are given special incentives to promote hydropower development.  \n \n6. \nIn  order  to  further  address  the  rehabilitation  and  resettlement  issues  linked  to  the \nconstruction  of  the  country\u2019s  hydropower  resources,  the  Government  of  India  has  announced \nthe New Hydro Policy 2008. This policy provides a level playing field to private developers, and \nelucidates  transparent  selection  criteria  to  be  used  by  states  for  awarding  sites  to  such \ndevelopers.  The  policy  enables  developers  to  earn  revenues  through  merchant  sales  up  to  a \nmaximum  of  40%  of  saleable  energy  with  the  balance  to  be  sold  under  long-term  power \npurchase  agreements.  The  policy  seeks  to  balance  incentives  for  private  developers  while \ncontaining provisions designed to ensure that benefits flow to the project-affected persons.  \n \n7. \nHimachal Pradesh, a small mountainous state with a population of slightly over 6 million, \nhas abundant water resources in the five major rivers flowing through the state from the western \nHimalayas. The power generation potential of Himachal Pradesh is 20,415 MW, which is about \n25%  of  the  total  hydropower  potential  of  India,  out  of  which  around  6,150  MW  has  been \ndeveloped. Recognizing the state\u2019s comparative advantage in hydropower generation, the main \nstrategy  of  the  government  of  Himachal  Pradesh  (GOHP),  outlined  in  its  state  hydropower \npolicy,3 is  to  become  the  \u201chydropower  state\u201d  of  the  country,  by  providing  affordable,  reliable \npower  to  its  residents,  and  selling  excess  power  to  the  national  grid  as  a  major  source  of \nrevenue  for  the  state.  A  new  corporate  entity,  Himachal  Pradesh  Power  Corporation  Ltd. \n(HPPCL),  has  been  established  by  GOHP  and  it  is  mandated  to  develop  and  operate  new \nhydropower plants in the state.  \n \n8. \nThe power sector of Himachal Pradesh ranked seventh out of 29 in a state power sector \nperformance  rating  study  mandated  by  the  Government.4 Key  aspects  evaluated  to  determine \nthe  ratings  were  state  governments\u2019  progress  in  implementing  the  key  provisions  of  the \nElectricity Act, 2003, and in obtaining rural electrification, the quality of the regulatory process, \nboth  business  and  financial  risk  analysis,  progress  in  attaining  commercial  viability,  and  the \ncreation  of  a  competitive  environment.  Noted  strengths  for  Himachal  Pradesh  include \nsatisfactory  progress  in  the  area  of  distribution  reforms,  particularly  metering  and  energy \naccounting, and achievement of 100% rural and consumer electrification. Himachal Pradesh is \none  of  the  few  states  where  energy  delivered  to  consumers  is  100%  metered,  and  its \ndistribution system has a high 97.4% availability. Furthermore, Himachal Pradesh has achieved \nmore than 90% metering of its distribution transformers and on feeders up to 33 kilovolts (kV), \nresulting in transmission and distribution losses of a comparatively low 16.3%. Also noted were \n(i) a strong regulatory process, including timely issuance of tariff orders and regular monitoring \nof performance standards and compliance; and (ii) significant steps taken to implement various \nprovisions  of  the  Electricity  Act,  2003.  The  state\u2019s  independent  regulator,  Himachal  Pradesh \nElectricity  Regulatory  Commission  (HPERC),  began  issuing  tariff  orders  in  October  2001. \nSalient features of its tariff orders are the adoption of a cost-to-serve model to determine tariffs \nin  order  to  rationalize  tariffs  across  various  consumer  categories,5 reducing  energy  charges  of \nindustrial  consumers  to  reduce  cross-subsidies,  and  the  introduction  of  a  high-voltage  rebate \n\n                                                 \n3  Government of Himachal Pradesh. 2006.

The  electricity  supply  for  the  people  of  Himachal  Pradesh  comes  from  its \nown  state  sector  resources  and  allocated  share  of  central  sector-owned  generation  within  the \nstate. The installed capacity of the state sector, which is predominantly hydropower, is 523 MW \nas  of  March  2007.  Himachal  Pradesh  experiences  energy  shortages,  especially  in  the  winter \nmonths  of  December  to  February  when  river  flows  are  at  their  lowest,  although  some  peak \nshortages  are  experienced  throughout  the  year.7 Currently,  it  is  able  to  meet  about  50%  of \ndemand from its own resources. During power shortages, the state must draw power from the \nnational grid, depending on the system conditions. Conversely, the state supplies power to the \nnational grid when generating excess hydropower during peak river flow periods.8 \n \nAccording  to  the  17th  Electric  Power  Survey,9 power  demand  in  Himachal  Pradesh  is \n10. \nexpected to increase from 4,861 gigawatt-hours (GWh) in 2006 (824 MW peak) to 9,504 GWh \n(1,611  MW  peak)  by  2012  and  to  13,136  GWh  (2,194  MW  peak)  by  2017.  This  implies \ncompound average growth rates of energy demand of 11.37%  from 2006 to 2011 and 6.69% \nfrom  2012  to  2017.  To  meet  this  growing  demand,  GOHP\u2019s  hydropower  development  plans \nmust  fructify.  As  both  the  central  sector  and  private  investors  are  interested  in  developing \nhydropower  in  Himachal  Pradesh  for  export  to  the  national  grid,  the  capacity  additions \nearmarked  for  the  state  sector  will  serve  local  customers  throughout  the  year,  with  excesses \nduring peak hydropower periods exported.  \n \n11. \nTransmission.  The  state\u2019s  transmission  assets  consist  of  2,100  kilometers  (km)  of \ntransmission  lines  rated  66  kV  and  above,  and  about  100  power  transformers  aggregating  to \naround  2,000  megavolt-amperes  (MVA)  of  capacity.  The  transmission  network  in  Himachal \nPradesh is part of the northern regional grid, which is operating in synchronous mode with the \neastern,  north  eastern,  and  western  regional  grids  (collectively,  the  national  grid).  These \nphysical  interconnections  enable  Himachal  Pradesh  to  exchange  power  with  these  regions, \ndepending on the daily power supply balance. With considerable hydropower capacity additions \nin  various  stages  of  planning,  development,  and  construction,  additional  transmission  capacity \nwill be needed to transmit the additional power out of state. \n \n12. \nDistribution.  In  1988,  Himachal  Pradesh  became  the  first  hill  state  to  achieve  100% \nelectrification  of  all  census  villages\u2014an  impressive  accomplishment  given  the  dispersed \ncustomer  base  and  mountainous  terrain.  Presently,  Himachal  Pradesh  has  around  19,000 \ndistribution transformers, 28,000 km of high-tension lines, and 50,000 km of low-tension lines. In \nmeeting the Government\u2019s requirements on energy efficiency and reduced system losses, it is \nessential  that  every  unit  generated  and  delivered  is  accounted  for  and  audited  at  different \nvoltage  levels.  Himachal  Pradesh  has  achieved  more  than  90%  metering  on  the  distribution \ntransformers and on the feeders up to 33 kV, and though its transmission and distribution losses \nare a comparatively low 16.4%, with aggregate technical and commercial losses of about 26%, \n                                                 \n6  FY2007 tariff order. \n7   In FY2008, Himachal Pradesh experienced a 1.8% energy shortage, with larger shortages in previous years. \n8   Peak hydropower generation occurs from April to October because of strong river flows from the spring snowmelt. \n9   The Central Electricity Authority periodically publishes electric power surveys, which include power sector data and   \n\nforecasts gathered from all sector agencies to be used for planning purposes. \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\nthe  next  step  is  to  achieve  100%  metering  at  the  distribution  transformer  and  feeder  level  to \nassist in further reducing this aggregate technical and commercial loss figure. \n \n\n2. \n\nCapacity Development \n\n13. \nGiven  the  considerable  investment  plans  for  additional  hydropower  additions  in \nHimachal  Pradesh  and  the  central  role  of  HPPCL,  capacity  development  is  required.  HPPCL \nwas  formed  in  2006  and  its  assets  are  derived  from  merging  two  existing  state  corporations, \nwhich  were  formed  to  develop  and  construct  two  hydropower  projects.  It  is  owned  60%  by \nGOHP  and  40%  by  the  state\u2019s  utility,  Himachal  Pradesh  State  Electricity  Board  (HPSEB). \nHPPCL has sound engineering and project construction management capabilities, and borrows \nexpertise from its parent (one of the better run state utilities). HPPCL\u2019s organization structure is \nin  Appendix  3.  Its  capacity  development  needs  include  enhanced  project  planning  and \nmanagement, as well as improved governance and financial management. \n \n14. \nThe  state\u2019s  independent  regulator,  HPERC,  has  been  functional  since  2001.  On \n30 October  2007,  HPERC  sent  a  separate  request  to  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  for \ncapacity  development  assistance,  which  would  be  carried  out  as  separate \ntechnical \nassistance.10 HPERC\u2019s  capacity  development  objectives  are  to  support  enhancing  institutional \ncapacity,  and  to  promote  and  update  the  regulatory  framework  to  address  upcoming  sectoral \nissues effectively, especially implementation of the multiyear tariff regime11 as mandated by the \nElectricity Act, 2003.  \n \n15. \nAs the state\u2019s transmission utility, HPSEB is responsible for the design and construction \nof the evacuation systems from hydropower projects to the transmission system, as well as for \nensuring  adequate  transmission  capacity.  Ensuring  optimum  HPSEB  performance  is  also  a \ncapacity development objective, given the considerable hydropower investment plans within the \nstate.  \n \n16. \nAdditional  capacity  development  needs  in  the  state  include  support  for  carbon  market \ninitiatives, particularly given the substantial hydropower capacity additions planned for the state \nand their ability to offset carbon emissions. Under the project preparatory technical assistance,12 \nADB funded a study to develop a carbon market development strategy for Himachal Pradesh, \nwith further assistance to be part of the MFF.  \n \n\n3. \n\nPrivate Sector Participation \n\n17. \nIn Himachal Pradesh, the state\u2019s aggressive hydropower development objectives cannot \nbe  reached  without  further  private  sector  participation  to  meet  the  sector\u2019s  financing \nrequirements  and  to  enhance  operational  efficiencies.  The  Government\u2019s  national  electricity \npolicy13 and  the  11th  FYP  stress  the  importance  of  increased  private  participation  in  India\u2019s \npower sector. In Himachal Pradesh, hydropower development was opened up for private sector \nparticipation  in  1991,  with  two  projects  (totaling  386  MW)  already  commissioned.  For  the \n11th FYP  (2007\u20132012),  8  hydropower  plants  with  combined  capacity  of  1,488  MW  (37%  of \n\n                                                 \n10 ADB. 2007.

National Electricity Policy. New Delhi. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n5\n\nplanned  capacity  additions  excluding  mini-hydropower)  have  been  identified  for  private  sector \nparticipation, with further additions expected beyond 2012. \n   \n18. \nThe primary constraints to private sector participation in the past, in Himachal Pradesh \nand  elsewhere  in  India,  were  complex  bidding  procedures  and  a  cumbersome  clearance  and \napproval  process.  Furthermore,  the  creditworthiness  of  state  electricity  boards  was  a  major \nconcern  for  independent  power  producers  (IPPs).  The  state\u2019s  hydropower  policy  addressed \nmany  of  these  concerns,  and  creates  an  enabling  environment  by  containing  bidding \nprocedures and by outlining incentives to attract private investment. The key policy features for \nprivate  sector  participation  are  (i)  procedures  for  selection  of  developers  via  signing \nmemorandums  of  understanding  for  projects  up  to  100  MW,  and  based  on  international \ncompetitive  bidding  for  projects  above  100  MW;  (ii)  no  clearances  required  from  the  Central \nElectricity  Authority  for  projects  selected  by  a  competitive  bidding  process  costing  up  to  $600 \nmillion;  (iii)  premium  sales  prices  for  peak  power;  and  (iv)  100%  foreign  equity  permitted  with \nautomatic  approval.  Furthermore,  the  introduction  of  open  access  and  power  trading  enables \nIPPs  to  export  their  power  to  the  national  grid,  allowing  for  more  flexible  and  favorable  power \nsales arrangements through the open access mechanism. \n \n19. \nAnother constraint to private sector participation is the very long gestation period when \ndeveloping a hydropower project. The need for detailed hydrology studies, the difficult mountain \nterrain,  often  remote  locations  requiring  construction  of  access  roads,  and  the  numerous \ngovernment  clearances  required  considerably  increase  the  risk  profile  of  investing  private \ncapital into early stage project development. Thus, it can be more practical for an entity such as \nHPPCL to commence the planning process; identify viable sites; conduct the relevant studies; \nand  obtain  the  various  engineering,  social,  and  environmental  clearances\u2014and,  at  this  later \nstage,  leverage  private  capital  and  expertise  through  joint  ventures  or  other  public\u2013private \npartnership (PPP) arrangements.  \n   \n\n4. \n\nSector Road Map \n\n20. \nGOHP has outlined a policy agenda for hydropower development in the short to medium \nterm,  backed  by  continued  reforms  and  capacity  development,  and  has  developed  a \ncomprehensive  road  map  to  achieve  these  goals  efficiently.  A  main  pillar  of  the  road  map  is \nhydropower  project  implementation  by  the  state,  central  government,  and  private  sectors.  The \nstate  sector  has  a  goal  of  adding  over  1,100  MW  of  additional  capacity,  with  290.5  MW \ncommissioned  by  the  end  of  the  11th  FYP,  and  will  allocate  funds  from  the  state  budget  to \naccomplish  this.  As  part  of  the  hydropower  policy,  promoting  additional  private  sector \ninvestment  in  the  sector  is  a  key  priority,  with  clear  goals  for  competitive  tendering  of  IPP \nhydropower projects by 2010, with ensuing privately owned capacity additions to follow, as well \nas a planned implementation of pilot PPP arrangements between the state and private sectors. \nAn  additional  state  goal  is  providing  enabling  infrastructure,  such  as  road  access  and \ninterconnection points, to facilitate hydropower development.  \n \n21. \nThe road map also includes institutional changes and stipulates formulating policies and \nguidelines  to  assist  the  sector.  The  key  policy  is  the  state\u2019s  hydropower  policy.  In  another \nexample,  the  state  recognizes  the  need  for  a  formal  state  environmental  policy  to  ensure  that \nthe  state\u2019s  investment  program  follow  a  path  of  sustainable  development  with  built-in \nenvironmental conservation and enhancement measures. \n \n22. \nIdentified  capacity  development  objectives  include  enhancing  planning  and  financial \nmanagement capabilities, particularly at HPPCL as the state\u2019s hydropower generation company. \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\nGOHP  identified  capacity  development  needs  in  implementing  ADB-funded  investments,  such \nas  support  for  design,  procurement,  contract  management,  and  subproject  management,  as \nwell  as  developing  expertise  in  environmental  and  social  safeguards  implementation.  This \nproposed  MFF\u2019s  capacity  development  component  will  support  these  efforts  to  commercialize \nHPPCL. A matrix that summarizes the sector road map is in Appendix 1. \n \n\n5. \n\nAsian Development Bank\u2019s Strategy in the Power Sector \n\nADB\u2019s  assistance  for  the  energy  sector  as  outlined  in  the  2008  country  partnership \n23. \nstrategy14 has six main priorities: (i) promotion of higher efficiency, low-carbon energy sources, \ne.g., run-of-river type hydropower projects,15 cleaner fuel, and renewable energy; (ii) expansion \nand  optimization  of  transmission  and  distribution  systems;  (iii)  sector  reforms;  (iv) institutional \nstrengthening to implement reforms required by the Electricity Act, 2003, including development \nof more flexible power delivery and trading systems; (v) promotion of private sector participation; \nand  (vi)  encouraging  energy  efficiency,  energy  conservation,  rural  electrification,  and  ensuring \nenvironmental  and  social  sustainability.  These  priorities  are  generally  consistent  with  those  in \nthe  previous  country  strategy  and  program  updates. 16 To  support  the  Government\u2019s  goals, \nADB\u2019s  future  strategy  for  the  power  sector  will  be  in  synergy  with  India\u2019s  11th  FYP.  ADB  will \ncontinue  to  expand  its  promotion  of  state-level  reforms  by  including  other  states,  and  by \ndeepening  its  efforts  in  states  where  it  is  already  active,  such  as  Assam,  Gujarat, \nMadhya Pradesh,  and  Uttarakhand.  The  proposed  intervention  in  Himachal  Pradesh  is \nconsistent  with  ADB\u2019s  strategy  of  promoting  higher  efficiency,  low-carbon  energy  sources \nthrough run-of-river hydropower investments, as well as institutional strengthening to implement \nreforms as required by the Electricity Act, 2003. \n \n24. \nEnergy\u2013Environment Nexus. A major strategic challenge in the Asia and Pacific region \nis  meeting  the  rapidly  growing  demand  for  electricity  in  the  most  cost-effective  and \nenvironmentally  sustainable  way.  This  is  particularly  important  in  India.  By  its  sheer  size  and \nincreasing  weight  in  the  global  economy  and  energy  markets,  India  has  a  key  role  to  play  in \naddressing the global challenge of climate change.  It  is  thus  vital  to  address  environmental \nissues in energy sector interventions, and to mitigate environmental impacts through promoting \ncleaner technologies.  \n \n25. \nThe Government recognizes the importance of energy and related environmental issues. \nClimate  change  is  an  important  consideration  in  India\u2019s  national  plan  and  Millennium \nDevelopment Goals. The Ministry of Environment and Forests is the nodal ministry for climate \nchange  and  the  Clean  Development  Mechanism  (CDM). 17  Other  relevant  agencies  and \n                                                 \n14 ADB.

Storage facilities use a dam to store the \nwater,  which  may  be  released  either  to  meet  changing  electricity  needs  or  to  maintain  a  constant  water  level.  In \ncontrast, run-of-river plants divert a portion of a river\u2019s current into a diversion channel, pipe and/or tunnel, which is \nthen  released  through  a  turbine,  and  delivered  back  into  the  same  river  downstream.  Run-of-river  designs  can \ninclude  weirs  or  barrages  to  ensure  adequate  flow  into  the  pipe  or  tunnel,  particularly  at  peak  periods.  However, \nrun-of-river  hydropower  projects  may  involve  the  construction  of  barrages  to  ensure  adequate  flow  into  the \npenstock or tunnel, particularly at peak periods, and thus may contain pondage predominantly  within the existing \nriverbanks. Such barrages allow water and fish passage through the river at all times (unlike storage dams).  \n\n16 ADB. 2004. Country Strategy and Program Update (2005\u20132007): India. Manila; ADB. 2005.

The  CDM  is  a  market-based  financial  instrument  with  the  dual  purpose  of \nassisting  developing  nations  to  achieve  sustainable  development  and  industrial  countries  to  meet  their  emission \nreduction  targets.  The  CDM  allows  industrial  countries  to  invest  in  \u201cclean\u201d  projects  in  developing  countries, \n\n \n\n\f \n\n7\n\ninstitutions include the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy, Bureau of Energy Efficiency and \nthe  Technology  Information,  Forecasting  and  Assessment  Council,  with  specific  mandates  to \npromote  climate-friendly  technologies.  The  national  environment  policy 18  is  the  framework \ndocument  that  specifically  governs  climate  change  interventions.  It  provides  the  basis  for  the \nintegration  of  environmental  considerations  in  the  policies  of  various  sectors.  For  the  energy \nsector,  the  Government  included  measures  for  increased  use  of  hydropower  resources  and \nrenewable  energy  in  the  power  supply  mix  in  its  integrated  energy  policy  (footnote  2). \nSpecifically  related  to  hydropower,  the  Government\u2019s  \u201c50,000  MW  Hydropower  Initiative\u201d \npromotes  capacity  additions  in  the  mountainous  states  with  abundant  hydropower  resource \npotential to implement physical investments that address the power supply mix.  \n \n26. \nAt  the  state  level,  GOHP\u2019s  hydropower  policy  puts  the  state  at  the  forefront  of  India's \nhydropower  development  efforts.  Himachal  Pradesh\u2019s  investment  program,  complemented  by \nthe  proposed  MFF,  is  consistent  with  government  initiatives,  as  well  as  a  number  of  ADB \nrecommendations on addressing the energy\u2013environment nexus,19 such as (i) promoting clean, \nrenewable  hydropower;  (ii)  including  a  strong  role  for  private  sector  participation;  and \n(iii) promoting  unbundling  and  restructuring. 20  The  carbon  footprint  of  the  energy  sector  in \nHimachal Pradesh is quite small, as nearly all its power generation is produced by emissions-\nfree  hydropower  and  the  state  has  comparatively  low  aggregate  technical  and  commercial \nlosses,  ensuring  that  power  is  used  efficiently.  Given  Himachal  Pradesh\u2019s  sparsely  populated, \nmountainous terrain, there is little heavy industry, though there are small but growing electronics \nmanufacturing  operations.  Himachal  Pradesh\u2019s  connectivity  with  the  national  grid  ensures  that \nits aggressive hydropower investment program is important in addressing India\u2019s overall energy \nand environmental concerns.  \n \n27. \nThe  sustained  dialogue  with  GOHP  enabled  by  this  proposed  MFF,  as  well  as  ADB \ninterventions  in  other  states,  ensure  ADB  support  in  helping  India  meet  its  considerable \nchallenge. ADB assistance to India encompasses both demand- and supply-related programs to \nenhance the impact of the Government\u2019s initiatives. This will be effectively achieved through a \ncombination  of  lending  and  technical  assistance  instruments.  The  interventions  will  include \n(i) renovation and modernization of the existing hydro- and thermal power plants, (ii) upgrading \nof inefficient thermal power plants to enhance their performance, (iii) developing renewable and \nalternative  energy  sources,  (iv)  reducing  technical  and  commercial  losses  in  transmission  and \ndistribution  networks  and  facilities,  and  (v)  mainstreaming  demand-side  management  and \nenergy  conservation  while  ensuring  environmental  and  social  sustainability.  ADB\u2019s  energy \nefficiency initiative and carbon market initiative will be employed to leverage resources for such \ninterventions and to allow promotion of energy efficiency, renewable energy, and other forms of \nclean  energy.  For  example,  ADB  has  provided  base  financing  for  CDM  projects  across  the \nregion  with  pending  carbon  credit  transactions;  and  ADB\u2019s  CDM  facility  provides  parallel \nassistance to projects that can qualify for CDM and to facilitate agreements between sellers or \nproject owners, and buyers of carbon credits.21   \n \n\n                                                                                                                                                          \ne.g., renewable energy such as hydropower, and to acquire certified emission reductions\u2014generically  referred to \nas  \u201ccarbon  credits\u201d\u2014that  can  be  used  to  comply  with  the  Kyoto  Protocol.  Certified  emission  reductions  are  the \nofficial  commodity  generated  by  CDM  projects.  One  certified  emission  reduction  equals  1  ton  of  carbon  dioxide \nequivalent. \n\n18 Government of India, Ministry of Environment and Forests. 2006. National Environment Policy 2006.

Since 1986, ADB has provided 33 loans totaling over \n$6.2 billion to the overall energy sector, with 19 loans totaling over $4.2 billion specifically to the \npower sector. A detailed list of ADB assistance to the sector, including individual and total loan \namounts, is in Appendix 4. Although this policy enabled ADB to support many projects, ADB\u2019s \nresources  were  spread  too  thin.  As  a  result,  ADB  could  not  fully  achieve  its  desired  goal  of \npolicy  reforms  with  its  power  sector  borrowers.  Since  2000,  ADB  has  focused  its  lending  on \nstates committed to reforming and restructuring their power sectors on the premise that moving \nthe power sector toward financial sustainability will increase the ability of state governments to \nallocate resources for poverty reduction.  \n \nIn 2002\u20132003, ADB conducted project performance audits of energy projects in India,22 \n29. \nwhich identified the following lessons: (i) land acquisition should be carried out expeditiously to \nminimize  implementation  delays;  (ii)  construction  contracts  should  be  properly  packaged \nfacilitate  project \n(including \nimplementation; and (iii) loan covenants should be appropriate, as loan covenants in a particular \ninvestment  project  lack  the  impact  to  change  overall  government  policies.  Furthermore,  an \nearlier performance audit of a thermal power project in India23 contained key findings including \n(i)  ADB\u2019s  energy  policy  to  promote  cleaner  energy  sources  and  reduce  reliance  on  coal-fired \ngenerating  capacity  is  reconfirmed,  given  overall  environmental  and  cost  implications;  and \n(ii) sector  restructuring  should  be  implemented  gradually  rather  than  attempting  quick  reform \nthrough project covenants. \n \nA sector assistance program evaluation24 was conducted in 2007 on the energy sector in \n30. \nIndia, which identifies lessons and areas where the Government, ADB, the private sector, and \nother  stakeholders  can  work  together  in  achieving  sector  development  goals  more  effectively. \nThe main lessons identified are: (i) ADB\u2019s approach to lending at the state level has worked well \nand  should  be  used  as  a  model  for  future  assistance;  (ii)  sustained  technical  assistance  is \nneeded  to  support  state  level  reform  programs;  and  (iii)  corporatization  is  providing  benefits \nsimilar  to  those  normally  attributed  to  privatization,  as  the  introduction  of  commercially  and \nfinancially  sustainable  principles  into  state  entities  can  considerably  improve  efficiency  and \ndeliver better services to customers. \n \n31. \nThese  experiences  are  reflected  in  the  design  and  preparation  of  the  proposed  MFF, \nincluding  corporatizing  the  state  hydropower  generating  company,  HPPCL,  and  providing \nsupport  at  the  state  level  for  reforms  and  capacity  development.  Lessons  have  also  been \nincorporated  into  subproject  selection  and  preparing  procurement  packages,  which  are \nconsistent  with  the  project  readiness  criteria  agreed  between  India  and  ADB.25 Details  on  the \nproject readiness for the first tranche of the proposed MFF are in Appendix 5. \n \n\n                                                 \n22  ADB. 2002.

The  Electricity  Act  came  into  force  on  9  June  2003.  Himachal \nPradesh  already  had  an  established,  functioning  regulatory  commission  as  of  2001,  and  has \nbeen issuing tariff orders since then. Annually, HPSEB and other licensees (e.g., certain IPPs) \nare  required  to  petition  HPERC  for  tariffs,  and  after  consideration  of  stakeholders\u2019  inputs, \nHPERC  rules  on  tariff  applications.  The  resulting  tariff  orders  are  the  key  instrument  of \nregulation and sector governance. Licensees are allowed to appeal the tariff orders, which may \neventually be resolved by court rulings. \n \n34. \nHPERC holds regular review meetings to monitor compliance with the various directives, \nand  in  its  tariff  order  for  FY2006,  it  made  efforts  to  reduce  cross-subsidies  and  to  optimize \npower purchase costs by mandating the procurement of power on a merit order dispatch basis. \nHPERC has also taken steps toward complying with the provisions of the Electricity Act, 2003, \nfrom  a  regulatory  perspective,  including  issuing  and  monitoring  performance  standards  for \nHPSEB,  constituting  a  forum  for  addressing  consumer  grievances,  and  appointing  an \nombudsman. In June 2005, HPERC issued open access regulations.  \n \n35. \nSector  Restructuring. HPSEB currently owns very little generation (476 MW total). As \nHPPCL is to own and operate all planned state sector hydropower development, it will become \nthe state\u2019s generating company. The corporatization of HPPCL effectively unbundles generation \nfrom HPSEB\u2019s predominantly transmission and distribution operations, and an eventual transfer \nof HPSEB\u2019s few generating assets to HPPCL is envisioned. Further to the process of HPSEB\u2019s \nrestructuring, HPSEB has drawn up a proposal for its unbundling. The first step is to unbundle \nthe  distinct  operations  internally  and  account  for  them  separately.  In  its  FY2007  and  FY2008 \ntariff  filings,  HPSEB  unbundled  its  costs  into  generation,  transmission,  and  distribution \nelements;  and  adopted  an  approach  toward  unbundling,  identifying,  and  isolating  its  assets, \ncosts, and revenues.  \n \n\nIII. \n\nINVESTMENT PROPOSAL  \n\nA. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nThe  impact  of  the  ADB-supported  subset  of  the  state\u2019s  investment  plan,  the  Himachal \n36. \nPradesh Clean Energy Development Investment Program  (the Program), will be a sustainable \nelectricity sector in Himachal Pradesh and improved state finances. \n \n\n                                                 \n26 There is a World Bank-funded project (412 MW Rampur Hydropower Project) located within Himachal Pradesh. It \n\nis a central government sector project with GOHP as a 30% minority shareholder. \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\nThe outcome of the Program will be increased clean energy production through run-of-\n37. \nriver  hydropower  schemes,  as  well  as  improved  planning,  implementation,  management  and \npower sector governance.   \n \nB. \n\nOutputs \n\nThe Program will provide financing for two major areas of investment: \n\n38. \n \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\nHydropower capacity additions. Construction of physical infrastructure built for \nhydropower  generation,  including  underground  powerhouses,  associated  civil \nworks, \ntunnels,  river  diversion,  and  power  evacuation  systems.  Specific \nsubprojects have been earmarked for the first and second tranches and include \nthe  Sawra  Kuddu  Hydroelectric  Project  (111  MW)  and  the  Kashang  I,  II  and  III \nHydroelectric  Projects  (195  MW).  Subprojects  identified  for  future  projects \ninclude  the  Sainj  (100 MW)  and  Shongtong-Karcham  (402  MW)  hydroelectric \nprojects, although others from the state\u2019s investment plan may be substituted in \nfuture tranches provided they meet the eligibility criteria. All hydropower projects \nproposed for the Program will be run-of-river design. \n\nCapacity  development. This activity will focus on addressing constraints at the \nImplementing  Agency  (IA)  levels,  wherein  $12 million  has  been  earmarked  for \ncapacity  development  components.  For  the  principal  IA  (HPPCL),  the  capacity \ndevelopment  is  designed  to  address  weaknesses  identified  by  the  procurement \ncapacity  and  the  financial  management  assessment  as  well  as  the  training  of \nHPPCL staff to be able to manage its growing asset size. The main focus of the \nproject  preparation,  implementation,  and  management  subcomponent  will  help \nthe  IA  (a)  prepare  future  projects;  (b) implement  and  administer  approved \nprojects;  and  (c)  monitor,  review,  evaluate,  and  report  on  program  and  project \ninclude  project  planning, \nimplementation.  This  subcomponent  will  also \nconstruction  supervision,  contract  management,  procurement,  disbursements, \nsafeguards  compliance,  and  monitoring  and  reporting  systems.  Financial \nmanagement  and  accountability  is  a  second  major  subcomponent  designed  to \nimprove accounting and auditing systems, while incorporating adequate financial \nmanagement standards to ensure fiduciary oversight of disbursed funds. A third \nsubcomponent  will  address  HPPCL\u2019s \nin  state-of-the-art \ntechnologies,  management,  and  development  of  in-house  capacity  in  CDM \nprocedures.  The  total  capacity  building  subcomponents  under  tranche  1 \nbenefiting HPPCL will be $9 million. The remaining $3 million will be used under \ntranche  1  for  the  benefit  of  the  state\u2019s  transmission  utility,  HPSEB.  The  new \ngeneration  capacity  to  be  added  in  the  state  will  increase  responsibilities  in  the \nareas of transmission and distribution for HPSEB. It was agreed to assist HPSEB \nin  acquiring  an  enterprise  resource  planning  solution  to  cover  all  its  future \ncomputer  accounting  and  management  information  system  (MIS)  applications \nand  to  finance  the  purchase  of  software,  hardware,  training,  and  initial  system \nmaintenance. The capacity development and action plan is in Appendix 6. \n\ntraining  needs \n\n \nTechnical Justification and Eligibility Criteria \n\nC. \n\nThe long-term generation expansion program for Himachal Pradesh has been designed \n39. \nbased on national, regional, and state-level least-cost expansion planning led by the Ministry of \nPower,  Central  Electricity  Authority,  and  GOHP.  The  expansion  program  is  technically, \n\n \n\n\f \n\n11\n\nfinancially,  and  economically  viable;  and  can  be  implemented  with  minimal  environmental  and \nsocial impact. Best practice design standards and construction techniques will be applied to all \ninvestments.  Technical  details  on  the  hydropower  projects  of  the  proposed  Program  are \navailable in Supplementary Appendix A.  \n \n40. \nfinancing under the MFF: \n \n\nThe  following  criteria  will  apply  for  selecting  and  approving  subprojects  intended  for \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n(v) \n\n(vi) \n(vii) \n\n(viii) \n\n(ix) \n\n(x) \n\n(xi) \n\n(xii) \n\n(xiii) \n\nthe  subproject  will  be  consistent  with  the  state\u2019s  hydropower  policy  and  forms \npart of the state\u2019s investment program; \nthe  subproject  was  designed  on  a  least-cost  basis;  and  reflects  \u201cbest  practice\u201d \ndesign, construction, and operations and maintenance features;  \nthe  subproject  displays  performance-based  design  consistent  with  international \nbenchmarks for system efficiency and operational risks;  \nthe subproject will be economically viable and financially sustainable; \nthe subproject was prepared and designed in compliance with the FFA (including \nADB\u2019s Social Dimensions and Safeguard Requirements set forth in the FFA);  \nthe subproject is ready to absorb the requested financing; \na  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  plan  that  meets  the  requirements  of  ADB\u2019s \nInvoluntary Resettlement Policy (2005) and the resettlement framework referred \nto in the FFA, as amended or updated from time to time, has been prepared for \nthe subproject and submitted to ADB for review, as necessary; \nan indigenous peoples development plan (IPDP) that meets the requirements of \nADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Indigenous  Peoples  (1998)  and  the  indigenous  peoples \ndevelopment framework (IPDF) referred to in the FFA has been prepared for the \nsubproject and submitted to ADB for review; \ninitial  environmental \nan  environmental \nexamination (IEE) (as the case may be) and an environmental management and \nmonitoring plan that meets the requirements of ADB\u2019s Environment Policy (2002) \nand  the  Environmental  Assessment  and  Review  Framework  (EARF)  referred  to \nin  the  FFA,  as  amended  or  updated  from  time  to  time,  have  been  prepared  for \nthe subproject and submitted to ADB for review; \nsummary  environmental \ninitial \nenvironmental  examinations  (SIEE)  for  environment  category  A  and  B-sensitive \nsubprojects, respectively, have been prepared and reviewed by ADB as required \nand  made  available  to  the  public  120 days  before  a  periodic  financing  request \n(PFR) is submitted to ADB; \na poverty and social assessment will be conducted for the subproject and results \nhave  been  presented  in  ADB\u2019s  summary  poverty  reduction  and  social  strategy \nformat; \nsufficient  counterpart  funding  has  been  allocated  by  India  and/or  GOHP  as \nrequired  to  implement  the  subproject  as  scheduled  and  maintain  the subproject \nin accordance with the requirements of the FFA; and \nall  necessary  national  and  state  government  approvals  have  been  obtained  for \nthe subproject. \n\nimpact  assessment  (SEIA)  and  summary \n\nimpact  assessment  (EIA)  or  an \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\f12 \n\n \n\nSpecial Features \n\nD. \n \n41. \nClimate  Change  Mitigation  and  Carbon  Emissions  Trading.  The  hydropower \ninvestments  are  candidates  for  earning  revenue  from  selling  emissions  reductions  under  the \nCDM. 27 Based  on  power  generation  potential  of  about  3,102  GWh  per  year,  and  as  these \nprojects are located in the northern regional grid considering an emission factor of 750 tons per \nGWh,28 these  projects  collectively  have  the  potential  to  generate  up  to  2.3  million  emission \nreductions per year, or 2.3 million tons of carbon dioxide (CO2) equivalent. However, a detailed \nassessment is required with respect to additionality issues and other requirements of the Kyoto \nProtocol  before  these  projects  are  taken  up  for  CDM  development.  In  addition,  most  of  these \nprojects are likely to be commissioned in 2012 or beyond, so non-CDM markets that could offer \ncarbon  credit  revenue  opportunities  should  also  be  investigated.  When  taking  into  account  all \nprojects  within  the  state  in  various  stages  of  planning,  there  is  a  potential  to  avoid  up  to \n21.8 million  tons  of  CO2  equivalent  per  annum  (footnote  28).  ADB  provided  a  CDM  specialist \nduring project preparation to assess carbon market potential for the proposed projects as well \nas the state as a whole, which resulted in a detailed presentation attended by state government \nofficials representing many sectors. At HPPCL\u2019s request, ADB has also provided terms for CDM \nfinancing  through  ADB\u2019s  Asia  Pacific  Carbon  Fund  and  Future  Carbon  Fund.  HPPCL  is \nexploring  various  options  including  evaluating  the  fund\u2019s  products.  Follow-up  missions  will \ninclude a presentation on the Future Carbon Fund and its services and benefits. \n \n42. \nPrivate Sector Participation. The state\u2019s hydropower policy recognizes the importance \nof private investment in fully harnessing the state\u2019s hydropower resources. There are currently \nabout  386  MW  of  privately-owned  hydropower  projects  operating  in  Himachal  Pradesh,  with \nadditional  2,238  MW  (including  750  MW  of  mini-hydropower)  earmarked  for  private  sector \ndevelopment  during  the  11th  FYP.  Given  the  huge  capital  needs  of  the  state\u2019s  overall \ninvestment  program, HPPCL is exploring various types of  PPP. In  April 2008, HPPCL\u2019s board \napproved a plan to develop a 500 MW hydropower facility jointly with the private sector, as well \nas 10 MW of solar projects within the state. In addition, another standby project29 in the state\u2019s \ninvestment plan may be considered for adopting a PPP arrangement. ADB has discussed PPP \nwith  HPPCL,  HPERC,  Infrastructure  Development  Board,  and  various  other  state  government \nrepresentatives. At the request of GOHP, the capacity development component of the proposed \nMFF will include knowledge transfer of the applicable structures and modalities, mechanics, and \ndocumentation requirements for HPPCL to enter into PPPs in hydropower projects. In addition, \nHPPCL is a candidate for assistance through a proposed ADB technical assistance designed to \nprepare and market actual PPP projects throughout India.30 \n \n43. \nCapacity  Development.  Other  than  supporting  HPPCL\u2019s  capacity  development  needs \nin project management, construction supervision, and ongoing project management, additional \nassistance  will  include  improved  governance  and  financial  management  to  support  its \ncorporatization  as  the  state\u2019s  stand-alone  power  generating  company.  As  HPPCL  intends  to \nenter into joint ventures with the private sector to develop and construct 10 MW of solar power \nprojects  and  a  500  MW  hydropower  project  in  the  state  by  forming  a  PPP,  HPPCL  has \nrequested  assistance  on  knowledge  transfer  of  various  aspects  of  PPP.  The  MFF  will  also \n\n                                                 \n27 A criteria for CDM eligibility is \u201cadditionality\u201d, and refers to whether a project is \u201cadditional\u201d and is not the business-\nas-usual  scenario  (e.g.,  if  the  project  is  less  profitable  than  either  a  benchmark  or  nonrenewable  alternatives,  or \notherwise faces other barriers). \n\n28 ADB estimate. \n29  Chirgaon Majhgaon Hydroelectric Project (46 MW). \n30 ADB.

In  addition  to  assisting  HPPCL,  the  capacity \ndevelopment component will include assistance to the state\u2019s transmission utility, HPSEB.  The \ncapacity development subcomponent within the Program totaling $3 million will assist HPSEB in \nacquiring  an  enterprise  resource  planning  solution  to  cover  all  its  future  computer  accounting \nand  management  information  systems  applications  to  ensure  HPSEB  is  able  to  properly \nmanage and report on its operational activities. Also, as upgrading transmission capacity will be \nrequired as hydropower generating capacity is added in the state, ADB is considering assisting \nHPSEB  with  its  transmission  system  master  plan  separately  from  this  MFF  (with  technical \nassistance preparation in progress).  \n \nE. \n\nInvestment Program and Financing Plan \n\nThe  state\u2019s  overall  hydropower  development  plan  aims  to  achieve  4,021.5  MW  of \n\n44. \ninstalled hydropower capacity31 by the end of the 11th Five Year Plan in 2012 (Table 1).  \n \n\nTable 1: Hydropower Development for the 11th Five Year Plan \nEstimated Cost \n($ million) \n\nSector \nState Sector \nCentral Government \nand/or Joint Sector b \nPrivate Sector \n\nInstalled  \nCapacity (MW) \n     290.5 a \n2,243.0 \n\n1,488.0 \n\n \n \n\n \n \n \n\n493 \n3,813 \n\n2,462 \n\n \n\n4,021.5 \n\n      Total \nMW = megawatt. \na  This  figure  reflects  projects  commissioned  during  the  11th  Five  Year  Plan  only. \n632 MW of the 808 total MW intended to be funded under the Investment Program \nare scheduled for commissioning post 2012. \nb  This  includes  projects  developed  either  by  Central  Government  power  sector \nentities alone or jointly with either state or private sector entities. \nSource: Government of Himachal Pradesh. Estimated costs are based on general $ \nper kilowatt cost assumptions. \n\n6,768 \n\n \nOther than the selected projects to be financed by ADB, financing for the state sector\u2019s portion \nof this generation plan is intended to come from other financial institutions in the form of loans. \nThe private sector project financing will be privately arranged.  \n                     \nThe  Program\u2019s  selected  projects  will  come  from  the  state\u2019s  portion  of  the  overall \n45. \nhydropower development plan and are expected to total about 808 MW. The estimated cost of \nthese selected projects is about $1.5 billion. The Government has requested financing up to the \nequivalent of $800 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, and both the Government and \nGOHP  have  asked  ADB  to  extend  this  financing  in  the  form  of  an  MFF.  GOHP  will  finance \n$450 million  (30%)  and  the  remaining  $250  million  (16.7%)  will  be  financed  from  other  Indian \nfinancial  institutions,  with  potential  lenders  being  Power  Finance  Corporation 32  and  Rural \nElectrification Corporation, or through other cofinancing efforts. Funding for tranche 1 will come \nfrom  ADB,  and  cofinancing  is  being  sought  for  future  tranches.  GOHP  has  already  released \nsufficient  equity  funds  to  HPPCL  for  2008  and  has  provisioned  for  required  funds  for  the \nfollowing  year.  Power  Finance  Corporation,  Rural  Electrification  Corporation  and/or  Indian \n\n                                                 \n31 Excluding mini-hydropower additions. \n32  Power  Finance  Corporation  is  an  Indian  public  financial  institution  dedicated  to  power  sector  financing  and \n\ncommitted to the integrated development of the power and associated sectors. \n\n \n\n\f14 \n\n \n\nfinancial  institution  financing  will  be  contemplated  for  later  tranches.

The  MFF  is  a  suitable  modality  for  this  Program  as  it \nallows  ADB  to  engage  with  GOHP  in  a  continuous,  long-term  dialogue  consistent  with  the \nGovernment\u2019s and ADB\u2019s clean energy policies. As hydropower is vital to India, and Himachal \nPradesh  has  the  hydro  resources  to  become  the  country\u2019s  hydropower  state,  continuous  ADB \nengagement  over  multiple  subprojects,  including  nonphysical  investments  in  capacity  building, \nwill maximize the financial as well as knowledge-based resources that ADB can offer GOHP as \na  client.  An  MFF  provides  up-front  support  to  GOHP  for  its  substantial  clean  energy \ndevelopment  program,  but  with  financial  commitments  sequenced  to  match  project  readiness. \nAs the sequenced investments are all run-of-river hydropower projects, expertise will build over \ntime, allowing future subprojects to benefit directly from the implementation experience gained \nfrom the initial investments and from the capacity development component, which is expected to \ncarry on for a significant portion of the Program.  \n \nThe MFF will extend multiple loans to finance a range of projects under the Investment \n47. \nProgram, subject to the submission of a related PFR by the Government and execution of the \nrelated  loan  and  project  agreements.  Each  PFR  will  be  accompanied  by  a  detailed  cost \nestimate,  as  well  as  an  implementation  schedule.  The  Government  is  required  to  comply  with \nthe  FFA  requirements.  The  loans  under  the  MFF  will  finance  civil  works,  equipment, \nconstruction,  consulting  services,  and  capacity  building  activities.  The  minimum  amount  of  a \nPFR will be $40 million.  \n \nAll provisions of the ordinary operations loan regulations applicable to London interbank \n48. \noffered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  loans34 will  apply  to  each  loan,  subject  to  any  modifications  that \nmight  be  included  under  any  loan  agreement.  The  Government  can  choose  from  eligible \ncurrencies and interest rate regimes for each loan. The specific terms of each loan will be based \non  the  related  PFR,  with  interest  to  be  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based \nlending  facility.  The  Government  has  provided  ADB  with  (i)  the  reasons  for  its  decisions  to \nborrow  under  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending  facility,  and  (ii)  an  undertaking  that  these  choices \nwere its own independent decision and not  made in reliance on any  communication or advice \nfrom ADB. \n \n49. \nIf  the  Government  requests  any  cofinancing  arrangements  or  related  assistance  for \nprojects  under  the  MFF,  ADB  may  assist  with  these,  subject  to  related  ADB  policy  and \n                                                 \n33 ADB. 2008.

Furthermore,  it  is  possible  that  ADB  will  seek  a  component  of  grant  funding  from \nthe Clean Energy Financing Partnership Facility35 for a portion of one of the loans. \n \n50. \nThe Government will provide the proceeds of each tranche to GOHP and will cause the \nproceeds  to  be  applied  to  the  financing  of  expenditures  on  the  subprojects  and  the  capacity \ndevelopment  component  in  accordance  with  the  conditions  set  forth  in  the  FFA  and  the  legal \nagreements  for  each  tranche.  GOHP  will  onlend  funds  to  HPPCL  under  arm\u2019s-length  terms  to \nensure commercial discipline. \n \n51. \nThe MFF transaction is accompanied by the tranche 1 PFR to finance two subprojects \nconsisting  of  hydropower  generation  facilities,  which  are  ready  for  implementation,  plus  a \ncapacity development component.36 The total cost of the first tranche subprojects and capacity \ndevelopment  amounts  to  $224.8  million.  HPPCL  requested  ADB  to  provide  $150  million  as  a \nfirst tranche loan. The amount of $150 million is a firm loan amount in ADB\u2019s 2008 assistance \npipeline for India. The detailed cost estimates of the first tranche loan are given in Appendix 7. \n \nF. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n1. \n\nExecuting and Implementing Agency \n\nThe Multipurpose Projects (MPP) and Power Department of GOHP is the EA with overall \n52. \nresponsibility for execution of the Investment Program and subprojects. HPPCL was established \nby the state government, and it is mandated to develop and operate new hydropower plants in \nthe state. HPPCL will function as the IA for the proposed MFF with responsibility for the day-to-\nday  coordination,  implementation,  and  administration  of  the  investment  subprojects  and \ncapacity  development  components  for  which  HPPCL  is  the  recipient.  Each  of  the  hydropower \nprojects will have a separate field office to facilitate its smooth functioning. They will function as \nPMUs at the field level, performing project site-specific monitoring, construction supervision, and \nreporting. There will be a central PMU within HPPCL\u2019s head office covering the overall MFF and \nperforming  centralized  financial  reporting  management  functions.  As  a  $3  million  capacity \ndevelopment  subcomponent  is  earmarked  for  HPSEB,  it  will  be  the  IA  for  that  particular \nsubcomponent. The MFF implementation structure chart is in Appendix 8. \n \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Period \n\n53. \nThe Program will be implemented over 8 years, including procurement and construction \nactivities. Each specific loan will have its own closing date to match the implementation period \nof  the  subproject(s)  funded  under  that  loan.  The  first  PFR  for  an  amount  of  $150  million  was \nsigned  on  11  September  2008.  The  indicative  implementation  schedule  for  the  appraised \nsubprojects is in Appendix 9 and an indicative schedule for the overall MFF is in Appendix 10. \n \n\n3. \n\nProgram Management \n\n54. \nHPPCL  will  appraise  additional  subprojects  following  approval  of  the  MFF.  HPPCL  will \nalso  undertake  detailed  design,  procurement,  construction  supervision,  commissioning, \n\n                                                 \n35 The Clean Energy Financing Partnership Facility was launched in April 2007 as an innovative mechanism to pool \nvarious forms of additional development assistance funds for clean energy under one roof. It is a multidonor fund \nwhich supports grant components of investment projects and technical assistance. \n\n36 This  consists  of  the  111  MW  Sawra  Kuddu  Hydroelectric  Project,  the  civil  works  for  the  65  MW  Kashang  I \nHydroelectric Project (including the common power house for the Kashang I, II and III Projects totaling 195 MW), \nand a $12 million capacity development component.  \n\n \n\n\f16 \n\n \n\nmaintenance,  and  operation  of  the  subprojects.  Technical  support  from  consultants  and \ncontractors  will  be  employed  as  necessary  with  funding  from  the  capacity  development \ncomponent budget. HPPCL will liaise with ADB on a regular basis. \n \nThe PMU will be responsible for processing and implementing the subprojects. It will be \n55. \nassisted  by  technical  experts  who  will  evaluate  the  technical  reports,  feasibility  studies, \npreliminary  design  reports,  environmental  assessment  reports,  resettlement  and  indigenous \npeoples  development  plans,  and  detailed  design  reports  to  ensure  compliance  with  ADB  and \ngovernment requirements. Summary appraisal reports will be submitted to ADB subsequent to \nGOHP approval and required government clearances.  \n \n\n4. \n\nPerformance Monitoring, Evaluation and Progress Reporting \n\n56. \nThe  PMU  will  prepare  quarterly  progress  reports  and  submit  these  to  ADB  within \n30 days  of  the  end  of  each  quarter.  These  reports  will  provide  (i)  a  narrative  description  of \nprogress made during the period; (ii) changes in the implementation schedule; (iii) problems or \ndifficulties  encountered;  (iv)  work  to  be  carried  out  in  the  next  period;  (v)  progress  on \nenvironmental  and  social  compliance;  (vi)  for  all  environment  category  A  projects  and  all \nenvironmentally  sensitive  category  B  projects,  a  report  on  implementation  of  EMPs;  and  (vi) \ncompliance with conditions of the individual loan and project agreements. The progress reports \nwill also include a summary financial account for the project components, including subprojects, \nconsisting  of  project  expenditures  during  the  period,  total  expenditures  to  date,  and  benefit \nmonitoring in accordance with procedures and details acceptable to ADB. Performance will be \nevaluated  on  the  basis  of  indicators  and  targets  stipulated  in  the  design  and  monitoring \nframework.  The  ADB  project  team  will  prepare  periodic  reports  to  inform  ADB\u2019s  Board  of \nDirectors  of  overall  progress.  A  Board  information  report  will  be  submitted  annually,  and \nsupplemental progress reports will be submitted prior to management approval of individual loan \nagreements. \n \n\n5. \n\nReview \n\n57. \nADB  will  field  an  inception  mission  within  3  months  of  the  first  loan  approval.  ADB  will \nreview  the  implementation  and  operations  based  on  the  quarterly  progress  reports  and  meet \nwith HPPCL and GOHP semiannually to discuss implementation progress. A midterm review to \nbe  carried  out  2  years  after  loan  effectiveness  will  focus  on  engineering,  resettlement,  and \nenvironmental  aspects  of  the  ADB-supported  investments  and  review  the  financial  status  of \nHPPCL.  Representatives  of  ADB,  GOHP,  and  HPPCL  will  take  part  in  the  review.  The  review \nwill  allow  for  any  necessary  midcourse  corrections  to  ensure  successful  implementation  and \nachievement of objectives. For all environment category A subprojects and all environmentally \nsensitive category B projects, review missions from ADB regional departments will conduct an \nannual  review  of  environmental  aspects  of  the  subproject.  A  project  completion  report  will  be \nsubmitted  within  3  months  following  completion  of  the  individual  loans.  A  facility  completion \nreport will be prepared after the completion of all ADB-supported activities and subprojects. \n \n\n6. \n\nStakeholder Participation and Consultation \n\n58. \nThe  project  development  agencies,  in  particular  HPPCL,  have  been  consulting  with \nstakeholders  including  affected  communities  during  the  design  stage.  During  the  preparatory \nstages of the first tranche projects, consultations have been carried out with various government \nofficials  concerned.  Local  communities  were  consulted  as  part  of  the  social  and  resettlement \nstudy  to  gather  their  views  on  the  proposed  Program.  All  the  affected  persons  are  also  being \n\n \n\n\f \n\n17\n\nconsulted  on  a  one-to-one  basis  through  questionnaire  surveys.  Additionally,  focus  group \ndiscussions are in progress within the project influence areas. Consultations will continue during \nthe  entire  project  cycle  according  to  a  stakeholder  participation  plan.  As  there  will  be \npreparatory  work  for  second  and/or  third  tranche  projects  during  first  tranche  implementation, \nstakeholder  participation  and  public  consultation  will  continue  as  initiated  in  the  first  tranche \nprocessing. \n \n\n7. \n\nProcurement \n\nless \n\nthan  $100,000  will  be  procured \n\n59. \nGoods,  equipment,  and  civil  works  to  be  financed  under  the  MFF  will  be  procured  in \naccordance  with  ADB  Procurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time). \nInternational  competitive  bidding  (ICB)  will  be  used  for  civil  works  and  turnkey  contracts \ntargeting the construction of hydropower plants. National competitive bidding (NCB) will be used \nfor  contracts  for  goods  and  equipment  estimated  to  cost  less  than  $1.0  million.  Goods  and \nworks \nfollowing  shopping  procedures.  Before \ncommencement  of  NCB  procurement,  ADB  and  the  Government  will  review  the  procurement \nprocedures related to the project component to  be funded by ADB to ensure consistency with \nADB  requirements.  Any  necessary  modifications  or  clarifications  will  be  documented  in  the \nprocurement  plan.  Contract  packages  will  be  prepared  and  structured  to  ensure  maximum \ncompetition.  Similar  contractual  arrangements  and  specifications  will  be  applied  to  other \nsubprojects.  In  accordance  with  these  arrangements,  a  procurement  plan  for  the  subprojects \nunder the tranche 1 loan is in Appendix 11. \n \n\n8. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n60. \nConsulting services are required to provide support to HPPCL for project implementation \nwork, including design, supervision of construction, management for the subprojects under the \napproved MFF loans, and for processing work and PFR preparation for future loans. Consulting \nservices  will  also  be  provided  for  evaluation,  monitoring,  and  reporting  purposes.  In  addition, \nconsultants  will  support  the  capacity  building  component  under  the  MFF.  Consultants  will  be \nselected and engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, \nas  amended  from  time  to  time).  Consulting  firms  will  be  selected  using  the  quality-  and  cost-\nbased  selection  method  and  full  technical  proposal.  Individual  experts  may  also  be  recruited \nbased on biodata submitted in response to specific terms of reference for assignments.  \n \n\n \n\n9. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n61. \nThe  proceeds  of  individual  loans  under  the  MFF  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with \nADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  Subject  to  ADB \ncontroller\u2019s  concurrence,  ADB\u2019s  statement  of  expenditures  will  be  used  to  reimburse  eligible \nexpenditures, which will be applicable to individual payments of $100,000 or less. \n \n\n \n\n10. \n\nAdvance Contracting and Retroactive Financing \n\nTo expedite implementation, the Government and GOHP has requested ADB\u2019s approval \n62. \nto  carry  out  advance  actions  for  procurement  of  works  and  goods,  and  recruitment  of \nconsultants. This advance procurement action is intended to be used in all tranches of the MFF. \nThe Government and GOHP have also requested retroactive financing arrangements to apply to \nthe MFF to cover incurred project expenses in accordance with ADB\u2019s procedures. ADB granted \napproval of advance contracting, and approval for retroactive financing on 10 March 2008. The \nGovernment, the EA and the IA have been informed that approval of advance actions does not \n\n \n\n\f18 \n\n \n\ncommit  ADB  to  approve  any  of  the  individual  tranches  or  to  finance  the  procurement  costs. \nExcept as otherwise agreed with ADB, the expenditures incurred for equipment, civil works, and \nconsulting  services  will  be  eligible  for  retroactive  financing,  provided  that  these  are  incurred \nbefore the effectiveness of the related loan agreement, but not earlier than 12 months preceding \nthe signing of the related loan agreement, and as long as they do not exceed an amount of 20% \nof the individual loan. Each PFR will specify the nature of expenditure if retroactive financing is \nrequired.  The  Government  and  the  EA  have  been  informed  that  ADB  will  not  finance \nexpenditures incurred prior to effectiveness of individual tranches, even if advance contracting \nwas approved, unless retroactive financing has also been approved. \n  \n\n11. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Financial Reporting \n\nHPPCL  shall  maintain  separate  accounts  for  each  subproject  and  for  its  overall \n63. \noperations. HPPCL shall have such accounts and related financial statements (balance sheet, \nstatement  of  income  and  expenses,  and  related  statements)  audited  annually,  in  accordance \nwith  appropriate  auditing  standards  consistently  applied,  by  independent  auditors  whose \nqualifications, experience and terms of reference are acceptable to ADB. HPPCL shall furnish to \nADB certified copies of such audited accounts and financial statements and the relating report \nof  the  auditors  no  later  than  9  months  after  the  close  of  the  fiscal  year.  This  shall  include  the \nauditors'  opinion  on  the  use  of  loan  proceeds  and  compliance  with  the  covenants  of  the  legal \nagreement(s)  as  well  as  on  the  use  of  the  procedures  for  statement  of  expenditures.  HPPCL \nshall  furnish  to  ADB  such  further  information  concerning  such  accounts,  financial  statements \nand the audit as ADB shall from time to time reasonably request. \n \n\n12. \n\nAnticorruption Policy \n\n64. \nConsistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance,  accountability,  and  transparency, \nADB  reserves  the  right  to  review  and  examine,  directly  or  through  its  agents,  any  alleged \ncorrupt,  fraudulent,  collusive,  or  coercive  practices  relating  to  subprojects  and  components \nunder the Investment Program. In this regard, investigation of government officials, if any, would \nbe requested by ADB to be undertaken by the Government. To support these efforts, relevant \nprovisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) are included in the loan \nregulations  (footnote  34)  and  the  bidding  documents  for  the  MFF.  In  particular,  all  contracts \nfinanced by ADB in connection with the MFF shall include provisions specifying the right of ADB \nto  audit  and  examine  the  records  and  accounts  of  HPPCL  and  all  contractors,  suppliers, \nconsultants,  and  other  service  providers  as  they  relate  to  the  subprojects  and  components \nunder the Investment Program. \n \n\n13. \n\nGovernance Measures \n\nADB\u2019s  intervention  will  support  the  corporatization  of  HPPCL  into  an  efficient, \n65.  \ncommercially  oriented  generation  company.  ADB\u2019s  capacity  development  component  will \nsupport organizational and governance efforts; and will enhance HPPCL\u2019s capacity to manage \nboth  the  physical  and  financial  construction  activities,  and  provide  management  and  financial \nreporting  to  meet  both  GOHP  and  ADB  accounting,  asset  management,  and  reporting \nrequirements.  On  managing  physical  construction  activities,  use  of  ADB  guidelines  on \nprocurement  and  consulting  services  and  standard  bidding  documents  will  provide  an \nopportunity  for  better  monitoring.  Bid  specifications  and  packaging  will  ensure  maximum \ncompetition.  On  managing  financial  activities,  recruitment  of  additional  financial  management \nexperts and the enhancement of internal control systems, supported with advanced information \nand communication technology-based financial management systems, will ensure efficiency and \n\n \n\n\f \n\n19\n\naccountability.  External  auditors  will  audit  the  financial  statements.  Measurable  financial \nperformance  indicators  are  being  set  and  will  be  evaluated  by  HPERC.  ADB  review  missions \nwill review HPPCL\u2019s accounting and control systems to monitor expenditures and other financial \ntransactions,  and  ensure  safe  custody  of  project-financed  assets.

The \nassessment  was  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Financial  Management  and  Analysis  of  Projects 37 \nusing  the  financial  management  assessment  questionnaire  and  field  interviews.  HPPCL \nincludes the merged operations of Pabber Valley Power Corporation (PVPC) and Kinner Kailash \nPower Corporation (KKPC), two companies established as special purpose vehicles to construct \nthe Sawra Kuddu and Kashang projects. HPPCL\u2019s first financial statements were prepared for \nthe financial year ending 31 March 2007, and following the merger of the three companies as of \n                                                 \n37 ADB. 2005. Financial Management and Analysis of Projects. Manila. \n\n \n\n\f20 \n\n \n\n1  August  2007,  the  accounts  as  of  31  March  2008  will  incorporate  the  assets  of  PVPC  and \nKKPC.  At  present,  PVPC  and  KKPC  are  construction  companies,  with  annual  accounts \nrecording works in progress and financing sources, with all staff costs and other operating costs \ncapitalized.  Revenues  will  not  be  generated  from  hydropower  projects  until  the  beginning  of \nFY2013.  The  existing  accounting  systems  of  PVPC  and  KKPC  are  manual  accrual  systems, \nbased  on  HPSEB  ledger  and  accounting  codes.  Accounting  staff  employed  by  these  special \npurpose vehicles at both the project site offices and head office will transfer to HPPCL. \n \nThe  capacity  development  component  of  the  proposed  MFF  (part  of  tranche  1)  is \n67. \ndesigned to address weaknesses identified by the financial management assessment, and will \ndevelop  a  computerized  accounting  system  and  MIS  that  will  meet  HPPCL\u2019s  accounting  and \nfinancial  reporting  requirements  as  well  as  the  project  level  accounting  and  reporting \nrequirements under the MFF. Staff will be trained in the new computerized accounting systems; \ncorporate  accounting  procedures;  and  in  all  appropriate  accounting,  reporting,  and  audit \nfunctions.  HPPCL  may  also  obtain  support  from  chartered  accounting  firms  for  internal  audit \nfunction  until  staff  has  been  properly  trained.  As  a  consequence  of  existing  support  from \nHPPCL\u2019s parent, HPSEB, and the proposed upgrading and computerisation of accounting and \nMIS  systems  and  recommended  training,  the  proposed  project  financial  management \narrangements are considered satisfactory. \n \n\n2. \n\nFinancial Sustainability\u2014Past Performance and Future Projections \n\n \n68. \nTo assess the sector\u2019s past financial sustainability, the financial performance of HPSEB \nwas examined. While HPSEB generated losses over FY2003\u2013FY2005, it achieved net profits in \nFY2006  and  FY2007.  HPSEB\u2019s  increased  revenues  and  improved  profit  performance  have \nresulted from an increase in electricity sales to consumers as well as an increase in power sales \noutside  the  state.  Another  factor  was  an  increase  in  tariffs,  though  revenue  increases  from \nhigher tariffs were partially offset by a sharp increase in power purchase costs. HPSEB has also \nimproved  operationally  by  reducing  its  system  losses  from  24.8%  in  FY2003  to  16.3%  in \nFY2007. However, HPSEB\u2019s net profit and internally generated cash has not been sufficient to \nmeet  its  debt  service.  It  has  nevertheless  met  its  debt  obligations  by  utilizing  long-term \nborrowings (timing  difference  between  drawdowns  and capital  expenditures),  increasing short-\nterm borrowings, and by extending payment periods to its creditors. HPSEB\u2019s balance sheet is \nrelatively  strong,  with  a  favorable  debt\u2013equity  ratio.  Accounts  receivable  are  creditable  at \n1.4 months  of  electricity  sales  revenue  in  FY2007,  indicating  that  most  customers  pay  within \n15 days of receiving their bill. This is a considerable improvement, compared with 4.1 months of \nreceivables in FY2003. The details are in Supplementary Appendixes C and D. \n \n69. \nGoing  forward,  to  ensure  sound  financial  performance,  HPPCL  should  maintain  a  debt \nservice  coverage  ratio  of  1.2.  GOHP  and  HPPCL  will  ensure  this  sustainable  target  is \nmaintained, even in the event of transfer of HPSEB\u2019s generation functions. Financial projections \nprepared for HPPCL demonstrate that a debt service coverage ratio of 1.4 in FY2013 and 1.3 or \ngreater is maintained through FY2020. The impact of the transfer of HPSEB\u2019s hydro assets and \nliabilities  to  HPPCL  was  also  examined.  The  transfer  would  result  in  a  positive  contribution  to \nHPPCL\u2019s  financial  performance.  HPPCL\u2019s  projected  cash  on  hand  in  FY2020  is  Rs7.1  billion \n($178  million)  when  including  HPSEB  hydropower  generation  operations,  compared  with \nRs2.1 billion ($53 million) without HPSEB\u2019s operations. \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n21\n\n3.  Financial Analysis \n\n \n70. \nSeparate financial analysis for each subproject and tranche of the proposed MFF will be \ncarried  out.  A  financial  evaluation  of  the  tranche  1  projects,  Sawra  Kuddu  and  Kashang  I \n(including Kashang II and III to be financed in tranche 2 as they are an integrated project), was \ncarried out in 2008 prices. The project cost estimates and financial projections were converted \ninto real terms by adjusting for the projected effects of domestic inflation. Project revenues are \nbased  on  the  methodology  applied  by  the  regulator  (HPERC)  based  on  the  2004  CERC  tariff \nregulations. The base case financial internal rates of return (FIRRs) for each project are 7.0% \nfor  Sawra  Kuddu  and  6.7%  for  Kashang  I,  II  and  III,  compared  with  the  average  weighted \naverage cost of capital (WACC) of 3.6%, thus indicating financial viability. Sensitivity analyses \nshowed  that  the  results  were  robust  to  a  range  of  project-related  sensitivities.  The  value  of \ncarbon  credits  was  not  included,  as  there  is  uncertainty  surrounding  the  value  of  such  credits \nbeyond  the  current  2012  expiration  of  the  Kyoto  Protocol.  It  is  expected,  however,  that  such \ncredits will further enhance the Program\u2019s viability, and the availability of credits has been taken \ninto  account  by  HPPCL  in  its  investment  analysis.  A  summary  of  the  financial  analysis  is  in \nAppendix 12.  \n \n\n4.  Economic Analysis \n\n \nEconomic  analysis  was  undertaken  for  the  subprojects  to  be  financed  under  the  first \n71. \ntranche  of  the  MFF.  The  economic  internal  rates  of  return  (EIRRs)  were  calculated  by \ncomparing  with-  and  without-project  scenarios.  Economic  benefits  accrue  to  consumers  in \nHimachal Pradesh, the national grid, and the overall economy. Incremental consumption occurs \nbecause of the extended availability of electricity during peak demand periods. This was valued \nusing  consumers\u2019  willingness  to  pay  for  this  incremental  consumption.  Non-incremental \nconsumption occurs as other forms of energy are displaced by electricity from the project (the \nresource  cost  saving).  This  was  valued  on  the  basis  of  the  estimated  marginal  cost  of \ngeneration  from  the  grid.  Although  only  the  civil  works  of  the  Kashang  I  project,  including  the \ncommon power hours for the Kashang I, II and III projects, is included in tranche 1, certain costs \nfor  the  Kashang  II  and  III  projects  (tranche  2)  are  incurred  during  the  construction  of  the  first \nstage. For this reason, economic analysis for the integrated Kashang I, II and III projects were \nundertaken rather than just for the first stage as a stand-alone project. Sensitivity to the effects \nof deferral and cancellation of the subsequent stages of the Kashang project was tested. \n \n72. \nInitial estimates indicate that Sawra Kuddu has an EIRR of 20.7% and Kashang I, II and \nIII  has  an  EIRR  of  17.8%.  This  shows  the  economic  viability  of  both  subprojects.  Both \nsubprojects  demonstrate  robust  economic  performance  under  a  range  of  downside  sensitivity \ntests.  A  summary  of  the  economic  analysis  is  in  Appendix  13,  with  further  detail  available  in \nSupplementary Appendix B. \n \nB. \n \n73. \nLand  acquisition  will  be  significant  for  the  Sawra  Kuddu  subproject  but  it  will  not  be \nsignificant for Kashang I, II and III. In both cases, the design is based on run-of-river schemes in \nremote  and  scarcely  populated  areas.  Impacts  will  therefore  be  limited.  Extensive  discussions \nwith  HPPCL  officials  have  occurred  on  involuntary  resettlement  and  indigenous  peoples. \nHPPCL  has  been  made  aware  of  the  documentation  that  addresses  social  and  resettlement \nissues and indigenous peoples that will be required for each tranche. The importance of proper \nimplementation of safeguards mitigation measures during the project construction and operation \nstages was also emphasized. \n\nSocial Aspects \n\n \n\n\f22 \n\n \n\n \nLand  for  the  Sawra  Kuddu  and  Kashang  I,  II  and  III  subprojects38 has  been  identified; \n74. \nand  acquisition  procedures  have  been  initiated  following  the  Land  Acquisition  Act,  and  the \nnational policy on resettlement and rehabilitation.39 Additional land will be required for widening \nthe access roads for Kashang I, II and III. A resettlement and rehabilitation plan was prepared in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy (1995), Operations Manual section on \ninvoluntary resettlement,40 and government policies to meet ADB standards and requirements. \nHPPCL assured that it will comply with all domestic laws and ADB policies, and has prepared \nrequisite plans where applicable, including the resettlement framework, which was completed in \nJanuary  2008  for  the  overall  Program  and  keeps  in  view  the  relevant  policies  endorsed  by \nGOHP.41 Social  screening  has  been  done  for  the  tranche  1  subprojects.  It  is  observed  that \ninvoluntary resettlement will be minimized. A census survey of all affected persons was carried \nout along with their socioeconomic details. Based on the assessment, two resettlement plans, \none  for  each  project,  were  prepared  and  submitted  to  ADB.  A  total  of  195  households  will  be \naffected,  of  which  193  on  a  permanent  basis.  A  total  of  49.42  hectares  of  land  will  also  be \naffected. \n \n75. \nAs  Himachal  Pradesh  contains  tribal  areas  and  therefore  benefits  as  a  special  status \nstate, HPPCL will ensure that issues related to tribal, indigenous or ethnic minority people, as \nwell  as  other  vulnerable  groups,42 will  be  addressed  and  taken  into  consideration  during  the \nproject preparation stage, whenever there might be a risk of marginalization or discrimination. If \nimpacts on indigenous peoples are identified, mitigation will be undertaken commensurate with \nthe magnitude of project impacts and sensitivity levels. This will be done through preparation of \nan IPDP (if required), or integration of specific sections in favor of the indigenous people in the \nresettlement  plan,  based  on  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Indigenous Peoples  (1998).  Keeping  in  view  the \nMFF modalities, HPPCL has prepared a draft IPDF for the overall Investment Program. Based \non the initial social assessment of the tranche 1 subprojects, it is noted that tribal people living in \nthe  vicinity  of  the  subproject  areas  are  mostly  mainstream  population.  Therefore,  no  specific \nplan  is  required.  However,  special  provisions  will  be  made  in  the  entitlement  matrix  of  the \nresettlement plan. The summary poverty reduction and social strategy is in Appendix 14 and the \nsummary resettlement plan is in Appendix 15. \n \nThe  resettlement  plans,  resettlement  framework,  and  IPDF  have  been  disclosed  to  the \n76. \naffected  persons  and  were  posted  on  ADB\u2019s  website  prior  to  ADB\u2019s  Management  review \nmeeting. They are also available as Supplementary Appendix F. \n \nC. \n \n77. \nThe  proposed  tranche  1  hydropower  projects  are  classified  ADB  environmental \ncategory  A.  Although  the  Kashang  I,  II  and  III  projects  can  be  classified  category  B,  the \nSawra  Kuddu  project  (funded  in  tranche  1),  falls  in  category  A  because  of  (i)  the \nconstruction  of  a  3-hour  peaking  run-of-river  barrage;  (ii)  the  resulting  effect  on  the  aqua \nfauna  and  flora;  and  (iii)  the  submergence  of  50.3  hectares  (0.50  km2)  of  land,  resulting  in \nsubstantially  reduced  water  flows  and  degradation  of  riverbanks  between  the  barrage  and \n\nEnvironmental Aspects \n\n                                                 \n38  Land for the intake site, powerhouse site, staff colony, and the approach road. \n39  Government of India. 2007.

Environmental  impacts  have  been  identified  for  both  the  Sawra  Kuddu  and \nKashang I, II and III projects. HPPCL prepared the subproject-specific EMPs. The hydropower \npolicy  requires  the  maintenance  of  a  minimum  ecological  flow43 in  areas  below  the  head  race \ntunnel,  so  both  projects  are  designed  to  comply  with  this  requirement.  Cumulative  impacts, \nincluding  downstream  effects,  have  been  determined  and  are  being  revised.  Environmental \nsafeguard documentation is available in Supplementary Appendix G. \n \n78. \nFor future tranches, HPPCL will ensure that all necessary environmental clearances are \nobtained  from  the  relevant  statutory  authorities  of  the  Government,  and  all  environmental \nmitigation  measures  set  forth  in  the  site-specific  EMPs  for  each  project  are  incorporated  in \ndetailed  designs  (including  any  amendments  to  detailed  designs)  and  followed  during \nconstruction  and  operation  of  the  subprojects.  HPPCL  will  monitor,  audit,  and  report  twice \nannually to ADB the implementation of tranche-specific EMPs. A full EIA is required, and for any \nenvironment category A or B sensitive subprojects, an SEIA or SIEE will be prepared and made \navailable to the public 120 days before a PFR is submitted to ADB for approval. The SEIA will \nbe translated and made available to affected persons in the project area. EIA reports for the two \ntranche  1  subprojects  (Sawra  Kuddu  and  the  civil  works  of  Kashang  I)  have  been  made \navailable  to  ADB.  The  SEIA  (Supplementary  Appendix  G)  was  completed  and  disclosed  on \nADB\u2019s  website  on  28  April  2008. 44  It  is  expected  that  draft  EIA  reports  for  future  tranche \nsubprojects  will  be  available  on  the  following  schedule:  (i)  Sainj\u2014September  2008,  (ii) \nintegrated Kashang\u2014November 2008, and (iii) Shongtong Karcham\u2014February 2009. \n \n79. \nAdequate provisions will be made in the Program to cover the environmental mitigation \nand monitoring requirements, and their associated costs. The project sites are located mostly on \nstate-owned  land  and,  to  a  smaller  extent,  on  privately  owned  land.  The  government-owned \nland and land acquired for the subprojects from private owners is mostly uninhabited and idle, \nand  located  outside  of  towns  and  villages.  The  subprojects  are  not  located  in  or  close  to \nprotected  areas.  The  civil  works  contracts  will  incorporate  mitigation  measures  related  to \nconstruction as specified in the EMPs. Implementation of construction mitigation measures will \nbe  the  contractor\u2019s  primary  responsibility,  and  the  IA  will  be  responsible  for  implementing \ntranche-specific  EMPs.  The  principal  impacts  are  soil  erosion  at  construction  sites  and \ncatchment  reservoirs,  impacts  on  potable  water  resources,  disruption  to  aquatic  life  including \nfisheries, loss of vegetation caused by potential forest and sub-forest clearing, management of \nconstruction  waste,  and  excavated  soil  and  rock  disposal.  These  impacts  will  be  mitigated  by \nerosion  control  measures,  provision  of  camp  toilets,  septic  tanks,  and  soak  pits,  treatment  in \nsettling tanks, reuse of excavation wastes wherever possible, controlled disposal of residual and \nexcavation wastes, and further by providing compensation for reforestation. HPPCL confirmed \nthat  no  endangered,  rare,  or  threatened  species  of  flora  or  fauna  have  been  reported  at  any \nsubproject sites. \n \n80.   HPPCL will make tranche-specific subproject EIA studies available to ADB. In addition to \nproject-specific investigations and feasibility studies, sector development plans prepared by the \nCentral  Water  Commission,  Central  Electricity  Authority,  HPSEB,  HPPCL,  and  other  agencies \nwill also be provided. ADB consultants will review the documents to confirm that the proposed \nInvestment  Program  is  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  energy,  environmental,  and  social  safeguards \npolicies.  \n\n                                                 \n43 Minimum ecological flow is 15% of 10-day threshold flow in a 90% dependable year. \n44 ADB. 2008. Environmental Assessment Reports for the Himachal Pradesh Clean Energy Development Investment \n\nProgram in India. http://www.adb.org/Documents/Environment/IND/41627/default.asp  \n\n \n\n\f24 \n\n \n\nD.  Benefits and Beneficiaries \n \n81. \nThe  overall  objective  of  expanding  clean  energy  generation  in  Himachal  Pradesh  will \ncontribute to state level economic development on several fronts. The first group of beneficiaries \nwill  be  local  electricity  consumers.  Electricity  from  the  proposed  hydropower  plants  under  the \nInvestment Program will go directly to the local grid, helping to fulfill growing local demand for \ngreater energy resources. Power consumption within the state consists of about 25% domestic \nusers,  7%  commercial  users,  59%  industrial  or  bulk  supply,  and  9%  irrigation  and  agricultural \nuse.45 The MFF is expected to result in more reliable power to consumers, and will rationalize \nthe cost of supplying power in the state by relying more on in-state power generation and thus \nreducing imports from the national grid. This will rationalize tariffs as well as improve the state \npower sector\u2019s financial viability.  \n \n82. \nIndustry  is  the  largest  consumer  of  electricity  in  Himachal  Pradesh.  Industry\u2019s  share  of \nstate  domestic  product  increased  from  1.1%  in  FY1950  to  15.9%  in  FY2004  while  services \naccounted for 17.3% in FY2004, up from 5.9% in FY1950. As the dust-free and cool climate of \nHimachal  Pradesh  is  suitable  for  the  electronic  and  precision  industries,  electronic  complexes \nhave  been  established,  including  the  manufacturing  of  watches,  thermometers,  microscopes, \nhospital  and  laboratory  equipment,  televisions,  and  computer  parts.  Furniture  making,  rope \nmaking, bamboo products, and manufacturing and specialized wood-based industrial units have \nalso been established within the state. These industries are expected to benefit from low power \ncosts. Social services in Himachal Pradesh will also improve as poor and vulnerable consumers \n(including hospitals, schools, and other social utilities) that are often hardest hit by inadequate \npower supply, load shedding, and poor power quality, will benefit from the Investment Program. \n \n83. \nThe  second  group  of  beneficiaries  will  be  through  job  creation  as  a  result  of  the \nInvestment  Program.  For  example,  the  contractors  are  expected  to  hire  skilled  and  unskilled \nworkers for the projects\u2019 civil works. Jobs will also be available beyond the construction phase \nthroughout  the  projects\u2019  life  cycles.  GOHP  has  a  policy  that  70%  of  labor  must  be  hired  from \nwithin the state. \n \n84. \nfrom  socioeconomic \ndevelopment programs financed through GOHP\u2019s policy of allocating 1.5% of total project costs \nto the community, with the funds to be administered by local area development committees led \nby  community  leaders.  These  funds  will  be  earmarked  for  small-scale  projects  benefiting  the \naffected communities as decided by the committees. As the total project costs for the proposed \ninvestment projects approaches $1.5 billion, funds approximating $22 million will be spent in the \ncommunities affected by the projects.46   \n \n85. \nClean  energy  development  as  promoted  by  this  MFF  will  contribute  to  local,  regional, \nand  global  environmental  initiatives.  In  addition,  the  Program  will  benefit  all  national  grid-\nconnected  electricity  consumers  via  the  export  of  excess  power  for  the  benefit  of  poorer  and \npower deficient states, and by eliminating the need to import power from the national grid, thus \nenabling  the  Government  to  meet  its  objective  of  developing  the  hydropower  potential  in  the \ncountry. \n \n\nthe  project  areas  will  benefit \n\nlocal  communities \n\nThird, \n\nin \n\n                                                 \n45 Averages of FY2007 actual figures and 2008 projections. HPERC. 2007. Tariff Order for Himachal Pradesh State \n\nElectricity Board (FY2007\u20132008). Shimla: Government of Himachal Pradesh (16 April). \n\n46 This is a GOHP policy and will be administered by GOHP and the local area development committees. Such funds \n\nare not part of ADB\u2019s funding packages and are thus outside of the scope of the projects. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n25\n\nPotential Risks \n\nE. \n \n86. \nThe  key  broad  assumptions  under  the  Program  are:  (i)  macroeconomic  growth  will \nremain  stable;  (ii)  GOHP  remains  committed  to  power  sector  reforms  and  institutional \nimprovement;  and  (iii)  GOHP  executes  its  investment  plan,  successfully  combining  physical \ninfrastructure investments with nonphysical investments in capacity development to maintain a \nsustainable  power  sector.  Broad  risks  to  the  Investment  Program  include  a  slowdown  in  the \ndepth and pace of policy and sector reforms, including those related to regulation, governance, \nfinancial management, institutional change, and tariff regimes. \n \n87. \nThese  risks  can  be  mitigated  political  commitment,  concerted  action,  and  sound \nsupervision.  GOHP  is  fully  committed  to  expand  its  power  supply  and  continue  with  sector \nreforms, including further tariff reform, improved corporate governance, institutional change, and \nincreased  private  sector  participation.  The  state  is  closely  following  the  execution  of  the  long- \nand  medium-term  plans  for  the  sector,  where  hydropower  development  has  a  prominent  role, \nand  recognizes  that  capacity  development  is  a  major  part  of  the  process.  GOHP  is  also \ncommitted  to  the  adequate  development  of  the  transmission  network  in  the  state,  for  which  a \nseparate transmission utility has been envisaged.  The proposed interventions will help address \nthese issues at two separate levels\u2014state and project. The themes covered are broad (planning \nand  policy  formulation)  and  specific  (due  diligence,  project  preparation,  implementation, \nevaluation,  monitoring,  and  reporting  for  results).  Good  governance  and  fiduciary  controls  are \nrecognized as important, along with measures to ensure transparency and efficiency.  \n \n88. \nSpecific  subproject-related  assumptions  under  the  Program  are:  (i)  the  commitment  of \nHPPCL  to  construct  and  operate  the  hydropower  projects  in  a  timely  manner  and  maintain \nproper implementation supervision, including implementation of safeguard plans; (ii) there is no \nmaterial  delay  in  concluding  tariffs  for  the  projects  and/or  on  arrangements  for  the  sale  of \nexcess power;47 (iii) GOHP continues to support capacity development and assumes ownership \nof  the  capacity  development  components;  and  (iv)  the  subprojects  will  be  eligible  for  CDM \nfinancing (purchase of carbon credits) and the CDM is extended beyond its 2012 end date.  \n \n89. \nSpecific  subproject-related  risks  include  delays  in  recruiting  consultants,  in  the  bidding \nprocess,  and  in  procurement  process.  Another  risk  is  the  lack  of,  or  delay  in,  counterpart \nfunding,  including  funds  to  HPSEB  for  construction  of  the  transmission  interconnections  and \nrequired  transmission  lines.  Construction  risks  include  an  increase  in  project  costs  and  the \nimplementation time frame caused by (i) implementation issues (the greatest risk being due to \nencountering  unexpected  poor  geological  conditions);  (ii)  commodity  price  increases  (such  as \ncement,  steel,  fuel,  and  other  raw  materials)  that  effect  cost  estimates;  or  (iii)  poor  contractor \nperformance. Many of the structures are large, bear heavy loads and stresses, and/or deal with \ntenuous foundation conditions. However, the structures are of conventional design and require \nspecial  but  common  construction  practices,  and  the  equipment  is  of  conventional  design  and \nmanufacturing  capability.  There  are  also  risks  in  quality  of  work  and  delays  in  construction.  In \nall, the works require highly qualified civil works contractors and equipment manufactures. This \ncan be achieved through rigid application of ADB\u2019s guidelines for qualification of contractors and \nconsultants  and  close  monitoring  of  the  contracts.  In  addition,  HPPCL  has  assigned  skilled \nengineering  staff  resources  to  mitigate  these  inherent  hydropower  sector  risks.  To  mitigate \n\n                                                 \n47 Currently, GOHP utilizes assigned, licensed power traders from PTC India (formerly Power Trading Corporation of \nIndia) to arrange for the sale of excess hydropower out of state during the peak summer period. GOHP intends to \nseek further opportunities in a transparent manner as power trading in India develops.   \n\n \n\n\f26 \n\n \n\ncommodity price risk, contingency funds have been allocated to accommodate unforeseen price \nchanges.  \n \n90. \nthe likelihood of the risks occurring. \n \n\nOverall,  the  integrated  benefits  and  impacts  are  expected  to  outweigh  the  costs,  given \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  and  GOHP  have  given  the \n91. \nfollowing assurances, which have been incorporated into the FFA or will be incorporated into the \nindividual loan agreement and project agreements, as appropriate. \n \nA. \n\nFinance and Implementation \n\n92. \nCounterpart  Funding.  The  Government  shall  cause  GOHP  and/or  HPPCL  to  make \navailable  all  counterpart  funds  required  for  timely  and  effective  implementation  of  the \nsubprojects,  including  funds  required  to  meet  additional  costs  arising  from  design  changes, \nprice escalation in construction costs and/or unforeseen circumstances, and shall cause GOHP \nand/or HPPCL to make the resources thus required available on an annual basis.  \n \n93.  Merger.  GOHP shall ensure that no later than 31 December 2009, the legal merger of \nHPPCL, KKPC and PVPC has been completed. Unless ADB agrees otherwise, the merger must \nbe completed in such manner (i) that the operations of KKPC and PVPC have been for the risk \nand  account  of  HPPCL  as  per  31  July  2007,  (ii)  that  the  assets  and  liabilities  of  KKPC  and \nPVPC  have  been  transferred  to  HPPCL  at  historical  cost,  and  (iii)  that  these  assets  and \nliabilities comprise all KKPC\u2019s and PVPC\u2019s assets, contracts, approvals, instruments and other \narrangements  pertaining  to  the  project  facilities.  GOHP  shall  ensure  that  the  actual  and \ncontingent  liabilities  acquired  by  HPPCL  under  the  merger  comprise  solely  arm\u2019s-length \nobligations incurred by KKPC and PVPC in the normal course of business. Until such time that \nthe  merger  has  been  completed  in  accordance  with  the  foregoing,  HPPCL,  KKPC  and  PVPC \nshall continue to operate as if the merger was completed already. \n \nFinancial  Accountability  and  Transparency.  By  31  March  2010,  HPPCL  shall  have \n94. \ntaken  the  following  measures  to  strengthen  its  internal  audit  functions:  (i)  adoption  of  internal \naudit guidelines in line with best practices; and (ii) appointment of internal controllers that report \nto the chairman and managing director of HPPCL on a regular basis. \n \n95. \nThe  Government  and  GOHP  shall  allow  and  assist  ADB's  representatives  to  carry  out \nrandom spot checks on the work in progress and utilization of funds for the subprojects. HPPCL \nshall  announce  the  project  and  business  opportunities  associated  with  the  subprojects  on  its \ncorporate website. \n \n96. \n1.2 following the commencement of commercial operations of the first subproject. \n \n97. \nFinancial  Management  and  other  Recruitment.  No  later  than  31  December  2008, \nHPPCL shall have recruited key finance staff, including an assistant general manager, a senior \n\nDebt  Service  Coverage  Ratio.  HPPCL will maintain a debt service coverage ratio48 of \n\n                                                 \n48 The standard formula comprises all free cash flows, expressed as the sum of revenues, less the sum of expenses \n(excluding  depreciation  and  other  non-cash  operating  charges,  movements  in  working  capital,  and  interest  and \nother charges on debt), divided by the estimated debt service requirements in such year of the forecast.   \n\n \n\n\f \n\n27\n\nmanager, and such other managers as required by the positions sanctioned in its organization \nstructure  and  manpower  plan  dated  12  June  2008.  GOHP  will  recruit  a  finance  director  for \nHPPCL as soon as possible, and no later than 30 September 2009. No later than 31 December \n2010, HPPCL will have recruited staff to meet all its other manpower requirements as laid down \nin the organization structure and manpower plan. \n \n98. \nTariff  Filing.  HPPCL shall submit to HPERC tariff applications for the subprojects in a \ntimely manner prior to commercial operations of each facility. GOHP shall ensure that the rate at \nwhich HPPCL sells the electricity it generates is established in accordance with, and meets the \nrequirements of, the relevant provisions of the Electricity Act, 2003. HPPCL will promptly submit \nall documentation reasonably requested by HPERC, including transmission service agreements \nor power purchase agreements as applicable. \n \n99. \nAssociated Facilities. The EA and HPSEB shall ensure that all additional transmission \nfacilities (including substations and power transmission lines) required to evacuate power from \nthe subprojects, are completed in a timely manner.  \n \nthe  recommendations  made  by \n100.  Capacity  Development.  HPPCL  shall  analyze \nconsultants under its capacity development component for adoption of suitable MIS, and agree \nwith  ADB  on \nthe \nrecommendations made by consultants under its capacity development component, and agree \nwith ADB on the extent and manner of implementation. \n \nB. \n\nimplementation.  HPSEB  shall  analyze \n\nthe  extent  and  manner  of \n\n \nSafeguards \n\nthat \n\nthe  resettlement  plans, \n\n101.  Land  Availability  and  Resettlement.    HPPCL  shall,  subject  to  compliance  with  the \nrelevant  provision  of  the  resettlement  framework  and  resettlement  plans  and  environmental \nassessment  and  review  framework  and  EMP  and  in  accordance  with  all  applicable  laws  and \nregulations  of  India  and  Himachal  Pradesh,  acquire  or  make  available  the  land  and  rights  to \nland  required  for  commencement  of  construction  activities  in  accordance  with  the  schedule \nagreed under the related civil works contracts, and will have cleared the utilities, trees, and any \nother obstruction from such land. \n \nincluding  compensation  and \n102.  HPPCL  shall  ensure \nentitlements  for  affected  households  and  persons,  are  implemented  in  conformity  with  all \napplicable  laws  and  regulations  of  the  Government,  including  as  amended  from  time  to  time, \nand  the  entitlement  benefits  as  listed  in  the  Government\u2019s  applicable  laws,  ADB\u2019s  Involuntary \nResettlement Policy, and the resettlement framework. \n \n103.  HPPCL  shall  ensure  that  people  affected  by  the  project  are  fairly  compensated  in  a \ntimely manner based on replacement values in accordance with the related resettlement plans \nand resettlement framework, such that their living standards are not adversely affected, and that \nthe  payments  will  be  made  in  a  timely  manner,  prior  to  dispossession  from  land  and  other \nassets.  HPPCL  shall  submit  progress  and  completion  reports  on  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement under the quarterly progress reports for each subproject. \n \n104.  HPPCL  shall  ensure  that  prior  to  land  acquisition  and  any  resettlement  for  the  project, \nthe relevant resettlement plan, including its update based on consensus of the affected persons, \nis disclosed with all necessary information made available to person affected by the project and \nconfirm that it be uploaded on the ADB website. \n \n\n \n\n\f28 \n\n \n\n \n\n105.  The  EA  shall  ensure  that  essential  public  infrastructure  that  may  be  affected  by  land \nacquisition  and  resettlement  is  replaced,  as  appropriate,  in  an  expeditious  manner  in \naccordance with the resettlement plans.  \n \n106.  HPPCL  shall  ensure  that  construction  contracts  contain  binding  requirements  for \nconstruction  contractors  to  fully  reinstate  pathways,  other  local  infrastructure,  and  agricultural \nland  to  at  least  their  pre-project  condition  upon  construction  completion.  HPPCL  shall \nadequately  record  the  condition  of  roads,  agricultural  land  and  other  infrastructure  prior  to \ntransport of material and construction commencement. \n \n107.  To  the  extent  required  under  the  resettlement  framework  and  to  the  extent  reasonably \npossible HPPCL shall engage an independent external expert or agency acceptable to ADB to \nassist with implementation of the resettlement plans. \n \n108.  The  Government  will  cause  GOHP  to  ensure  that  within  three  months  of  the  loan \neffective  date,  the  EA  will  establish  a  grievance  redress  committee  or  committees  with \nrepresentation  from  all  stakeholders  in  the  subprojects  for  addressing  any  grievances  from \naffected peoples concerning resettlement, environment and any other social issues in a timely \nmanner. \n \n109.  Environment. HPPCL shall implement the projects and operate and maintain all project \nfacilities  in  accordance  with  the  EARF,  EIA,  ADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy  and  the  Government\u2019s \nand GOHP\u2019s applicable laws, rules, and regulations. HPPCL shall ensure that the provisions of \nthe  EIA,  SEIA  are  adhered  to  during  the  design,  construction  and  operation  of  the  project \nfacilities. Any changes to the location, land alignment, or environmental impacts on account of \ndetailed  designs  of  the  subprojects  shall  be  mutually  agreed  between  the  Government  and \nADB, and must be consistent with the eligibility criteria set forth in the FFA. \n \n110.

State  governments  also \nhave  an  important  role  to  play  in  power  development  conforming  to  the  policies  of  the \nGovernment. The Electricity Act, 2003, requires MOP, in consultation with state governments, to \nreview  and  update  the  National  Electricity  Policy1 and  the  National  Tariff  Policy2 from  time  to \ntime.  In  all  technical  and  techno-economic  matters,  MOP  is  assisted  by  the  Central  Electricity \nAuthority  (CEA),  a  statutory  body  constituted  under  the  Electricity  Act.  CEA  is  also  mandated \nevery 5 years to prepare and ratify the national electricity plan in accordance with the national \nelectricity  policy,  after  obtaining  the  approval  of  MOP.  The  Central  Electricity  Regulatory \nCommission (CERC) and the state electricity regulatory commissions, which function in a quasi-\njudicial  manner,  are  responsible  for  regulation  of  the  sector\u2014including  licensing,  tariff  setting, \nand  protection  of  consumer  interests.  An  appellate  tribunal  for  electricity  under  the  2003 \nlegislation  was  established  to  hear  appeals  against  regulatory  commissions  or  adjudicating \nofficers. Nuclear power generation is under the purview of the Department of Atomic Energy.  \n \n2. \nThe power generation, transmission, generation, and transmission facilities are mostly in \nthe central sector and state sector, and to a small extent in the private sector; there are also a \nfew  joint  ventures.  Power  trading  is  now  a  licensed  activity,  and  a  power  exchange  is \noperational.  A  broad  schematic  of  the  organizational  and  regulatory  structure  of  Indian  power \nsector is in Figure A2.  \n\n                                                 \n1 Ministry of Power, Government of India. 2005.

The act \nprimarily  mandates  continued  restructuring  of  state  electricity  boards,  full  metering  for  all \nconsumer classes, open access to transmission systems, facilitation of power trading, and tariff \nrationalization.  It  provides  the  framework  for  future  development  of  the  power  sector.  The \nEnergy  Conservation  Act,  2001,  which  came  into  effect  in  March  2002,  is  another  important \nlegislation  having  significant  impact  on  power  development.  This  act  laid  down  concrete \nmeasures to ensure efficient use of energy and its conservation. A Bureau of Energy Efficiency \nhas  been  set  up  to  make  wide-ranging  regulations  to  further  the  objectives  of  the  act.  In \naddition,  the  central  and  state  governments  have  been  empowered  to  facilitate  and  enforce \nefficient use of energy and its conservation. \n \n4. \nThe Electricity Act, 2003, includes a provision for MOP to update and publish a national \nelectricity  policy  regularly.  The  current  policy  document  is  dated  12  February  2005.  Its  broad \npolicy objectives include: (i) access to electricity for all households by 2010; (ii) demand to be \nfully  met  by  2012,  with  energy  and  peaking  shortages  to  be  overcome,  and  with  adequate \nspinning reserves available; (iii) supply of reliable and quality power of specified standards in an \nefficient manner and at reasonable rates; (iv) per capita availability of electricity to be increased \nto  over  1,000  kilowatt-hours  (kWh)  by  2012;  (v)  minimum  lifeline  consumption  of  1  kWh  per \nhousehold per day as a merit good by 2012; (vi) financial turnaround and commercial viability of \nthe sector; and (vii) protection of consumers\u2019 interests. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f40  Appendix 2 \n\nIn  compliance  with  the  Electricity  Act,  2003,  the  Government  has  issued  the  national \n\n5. \nelectricity policy and the national tariff policy. The broad objectives of the policies are to:  \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nensure  availability  of  electricity  to  consumers  at  reasonable  and  competitive \nrates;  \n\nensure financial viability of the sector and attract investments;  \n\npromote  transparency,  consistency,  and  predictability  in  regulatory  approaches \nacross jurisdictions and minimize perceptions of regulatory risks; and \n\npromote  competition,  efficiency  in  operations,  and  improvement  in  quality  of \nsupply.  \n\n \nC. \n\nIndian Energy Road Map  \n\nTo  ensure  energy  security  for  the  country,  India  has  decided  to  fully  develop  all \n6. \ndomestically  available  energy  options.  Though  India  has  abundant  reserves  of  coal  and  coal \nshall  remain  an  important  source  for  power  generation  in  the  medium  term,  India  has  also \ndecided to tread a low carbon path for meeting energy needs. Therefore, thermal power projects \ndeploying  more  efficient,  super  critical  technology  are  being  encouraged.  Gas  based  power \ngeneration  shall  be  dependent  upon  the  availability  and  pricing  of  gas.    Nuclear  power \ngeneration shall be dependent upon the access to civilian nuclear technology and availability of \nnuclear  fuel.    With  about  9,000  MW  of  installed  capacity,  India  is  the  4th  largest  producer  of \nwind  power  in  the  world.  To  address  climate  change  issues,  India  has  drawn  up  a  National \nAction  Plan,  under  which  a  Solar  Mission  has  been  detailed  to  promote  solar  power.  India  is \nalso giving emphasis to the conservation of energy. \n  \nD. \n\n50,000 MW Hydro Initiative  \n\n7. \nHydroelectric  power  is  recognized  as  one  of  the  most  economic  and  preferred  energy \nsources  because  it  is  a  low  variable  cost,  clean,  renewable  energy  source;  and  it  is  able  to \nimprove system reliability via its instantaneous starting, stopping, and load-following capabilities. \nHowever, India\u2019s share of hydropower has been steadily declining during the last three decades, \nresulting in reductions in overall system efficiency. The Government recognizes the importance \nof  increasing  the  share  of  hydropower  generation  in  the  energy  mix  and  introduced  the \n\u201c50,000 megawatts  (MW)  hydropower  initiative\u201d  in  2003.  Under  this  Program,  pre-feasibility \nreports  of  162  new  projects,  with  an  aggregate  capacity  of  47,930  MW  distributed  across \n16 states,  have  been  prepared.  Out  of  these  162  schemes,  73  schemes  having  first  year \nindicative tariffs below Rs2.50 have been selected for preparation of detailed project reports and \nsubsequent  implementation.3 The  installed  capacity  of  these  schemes  is  about  33,000  MW. \nUnder this hydropower initiative, the north western and north eastern states, including Himachal \nPradesh, are given special incentives to promote hydropower development. \n \nE. \n\nNew Hydro Policy 2008 \n\n8. \nIn  order  to  further  address  the  rehabilitation  and  resettlement  issues  linked  to  the \nconstruction  of  the  country\u2019s  hydropower  resources,  the  Government  of  India  has  announced \nthe New Hydro Policy 2008. This policy provides a level playing field to private developers, and \nelucidates  transparent  selection  criteria  to  be  used  by  states  for  awarding  sites  to  such \ndevelopers.  The  policy  enables  developers  to  earn  revenues  through  merchant  sales  up  to  a \nmaximum of 40% of saleable energy (with penalties that reduce this benefit if there are delays in \nreaching commercial operations), with the balance to be sold under long term power purchase \nagreements.  The  policy  seeks  to  balance  incentives  for  private  developers  while  containing \n                                                 \n3 The cost of preparation of detailed project reports is proposed to be recovered later from the developers. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 2 \n\n41 \n\nprovisions designed to ensure that benefits flow to the project-affected persons. These benefits \ninclude  100  kWh  of  electricity  per  month  to  each  project-affected  family  (in  cash  or  kind  or \ncombination),  requirements  for  the  project  developer  to  assists  in  rural  electrification  in  the \nproject-affected  area    by  contributing  10%  of  the  states\u2019  share  of  electricity  into  Rajiv  Gandhi \nGramin Vidyutikan Yojana (a rural electrification scheme initiated in 2005 by the Government of \nIndia),  contributions  to    local  area  development  funds,  and  the  setting  up  of  industrial  training \ninstitutes in the project-affected areas to improve employment opportunities for project affected \npersons.  The  rehabilitation  and  resettlement  package  for  hydropower  projects  as  specified  in \nthis  policy  are  more  generous  than  the  requirements  of  the  National  Rehabilitation  & \nResettlement  Policy,  2007.  The  new  hydro  policy  aims  to  make  the  project-affected  families \nstakeholders in the project. \n \nF. \n\nHimachal Pradesh Sector Structure \n\n9. \nMPP and Power Department. The Multipurpose Projects (MPP) and Power Department \nof  the  government  of  Himachal  Pradesh  (GOHP)  was  formed  in  April  1964  after  realizing  the \nneed  for  exploiting  the  substantial  hydropower  potential  available  in  the  state\u2019s  river  basins. \nAfter  transferring  power  development  and  operations  functions  to  Himachal  Pradesh  State \nElectricity  Board  (HPSEB)  upon  its  formation  in  1971,  the  department  has  focused  on \nformulating and implementing sector policies.  \n \nHimachal Pradesh State Electricity Board. HPSEB is a vertically integrated utility with \n10. \nresponsibility  for  electricity  generation,  transmission,  and  distribution  in  the  state  since  its \nformation  in  1971.  HPSEB  operates  under  state  direction and  interacts  with  the  central  power \nutilities for planning and coordination. The installed capacity of the state is 413.5 MW, with total \navailability including purchased power of around 1,900 MW. HPSEB\u2019s electric tariff is one of the \nlowest  in  the  country,  and  ranges  from  a  subsidized  Rs0.70  per  kWh  to  Rs4.0  per  kWh, \ndepending on consumer type.   \n \nHimachal Pradesh Power Corporation Limited (HPPCL). HPPCL was incorporated in \n11. \nDecember  2006  as  a  joint  venture  of  GOHP  and  HPSEB  to  develop  and  operate  new \nhydropower projects in the state. GOHP and HPSEB have a 60:40 participation, respectively.   \n \nHimachal Pradesh Energy Development Agency (HIMURJA). HIMURJA is the nodal \n12. \nalternative  energy  agency  responsible  for  promoting  small  hydropower  projects  up  to  5  MW \ncapacity.  A  total  of  750  MW  of  small-scale  hydropower  projects  has  been  identified  by \nHIMURJA for development. \n \n13. \nHimachal  Pradesh  Electricity  Regulatory  Commission  (HPERC).  HPERC  was \nestablished and incorporated by GOHP on 30 December 2000. It is mandated to take measures \nconducive  to  the  development  and  management  of  the  electricity  industry  in  an  efficient, \neconomic,  and  competitive  manner.  HPERC  also  acts  to  safeguard  consumer  interests  and \nimprove  the  quality  of  service.  It  functions  in  a  quasi-judicial  manner,  and  has  the  power  to \nmake  regulations  for  the  conduct  of  its  proceedings  and  discharge  of  its  functions.  Its  main \nfunctions  include  determining  electricity  tariffs  (bulk,  grid,  and  retail)  and  transmission  tariffs, \nregulating the power purchase process and promotion of competition, efficiency, and economy \nin the electricity sector. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f42  Appendix 2 \n\nG. \n\nHimachal Pradesh Power Sector \n\n1. \n\nGovernment Strategy \n\n14. \nHimachal Pradesh has abundant water resources in the five major rivers flowing through \nthe state from the western Himalayas. The power generation potential of Himachal Pradesh is \n20,415  MW,  out  of  which  only  about  6,150  MW  has  been  developed.  GOHP\u2019s  main  strategy, \noutlined  in  its  state  hydropower  policy,4 is  the  development  of  the  state  as  the  \u201chydropower \nstate\u201d  of  the  country,  by  providing  affordable,  reliable,  and  quality  power  to  its  residents  and \nexporting power to the national grid as a major source of revenue to the state. GOHP views the \nexploitation of the immense hydropower potential as a means for prosperity. Thus, it intends to \nspeed  up  hydropower  development  in  the  state  and  plans  to  add  about  4,021.5  MW  of \nadditional capacity during the 11th Five Year Plan (FYP). \n \n\n2. \n\nCapacity and Constraints \n\n15. \nGeneration.  The  electricity  supply  for  the  people  of  Himachal  Pradesh  comes  from  its \nown state sector resources and allocated share of central sector-owned generation in the state. \nAs of March 2007, the installed capacity of the state sector, which is predominantly hydropower, \nis 523 MW. Himachal Pradesh experiences energy shortages, especially in the winter months of \nDecember to February when river flows are at their lowest, although some peak shortages are \nexperienced  throughout  the  year.  Currently,  it  is  able  to  meet  about  50%  of  demand  from  its \nown  resources.  During  peak  shortages,  the  state  must  draw  power  from  the  national  grid, \ndepending on the system conditions. Conversely, the state supplies power to the national grid \nwhen  generating  excess  hydropower.  The  power  requirement  of  the  state  during  FY2007  was \n5,136 million units of energy and 873 MW in terms of peak demand. The availability of power \nwas  less  than  the  requirement,  and  the  state  experienced  an  energy  shortage  of  2.7%  as  a \nresult. However, there was no peaking shortage during FY2006.5  \n \nAccording  to  the  17th  Electric  Power  Survey,6 power  demand  in  Himachal  Pradesh  is \n16. \nexpected to increase from 4,861 gigawatt-hours (GWh) in 2006 to 9,504 GWh (1,611 MW peak) \nby FY2011 and 13,136 GWh (2,194 MW peak) by 2017. This implies compound average growth \nrates  of  energy  demand  of  11.37%  from  FY2006  to  FY2011  and  6.69%  from  FY2012  to \nFY2016. To meet this growing demand, GOHP\u2019s hydropower development plans must fructify. \nAs  both  the  central  sector  and  private  investors  are  interested  in  developing  hydropower  in \nHimachal Pradesh for export to the national grid, the capacity additions earmarked for the state \nsector will serve local customers, with excesses during peak hydropower periods exported. Of \nthe  4,021.5 MW  of  additional  capacity  to  be  added  by  the  end  of  the  11th  FYP,  the  identified \nhydropower  sites  have  been  allocated  to  state,  central,  and  private  sector  investors.  Central \npublic  sector  utilities  are  expected  to  develop  about  2,243  MW,  the  private  sector  about \n1,488 MW,  and  the  state  sector  about  290.5  MW  (with  an  additional  810  MW  intended  to  be \ncommissioned post-2012). An additional 750 MW of mini-hydropower (< 5 MW per site) is to be \ndeveloped privately under the lead of HIMURJA.  \n \n17. \nTransmission.  The  state\u2019s  transmission  system  consists  of  2,100  kilometers  (km)  of \ntransmission  lines  rated  66  kilovolts  (kV)  and  above,  and  about  100  power  transformers \naggregating  to  around  2,000  megavolt-amperes  (MVA)  of  capacity.  The  transmission  system \nrequirements  in  Himachal  Pradesh  are  different  from  most  of  India\u2019s  power  utilities  in  that, \nbesides  meeting  in-state  demand,  it  also  transfers  significant  amounts  of  power  outside  the \n\n                                                 \n4 Government of Himachal Pradesh. 2006.

New Delhi. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 2 \n\n43 \n\nstate, particularly in the surplus months of April to October. The in-state transmission system is \ncapable  of  handling  the  additional  capacity  to  be  added  through  this  proposed  multitranche \nfinancing  facility  (MFF).  However,  with  the  considerable  hydropower  capacity  additions  in \nvarious stages of planning, development, and construction\u2014including central and private sector \ninvestments\u2014there will be a corresponding need for additional transmission capacity to be able \nto wheel the ensuing increase in power production. Such investments, however, are handled by \nPower  Grid  Corporation  of  India  Limited,  the  national  transmission  company  responsible  for \ninterstate  electricity  transmission.  Investments  in  this  area  have  been  announced  and  are  in \nvarious stages of development. \n \n18. \nDistribution.  In  1988,  Himachal  Pradesh  became  the  first  hill  state  to  achieve  100% \nelectrification  of  all  census  villages\u2014an  impressive  accomplishment  given  the  dispersed \ncustomer  base  and  mountainous \nterrain.  Currently,  Himachal  Pradesh  has  around \n19,000 distribution transformers, 28,000 km of high tension lines, and 50,000 km of low tension \nlines.  Himachal  Pradesh  is  one  of  the  few  states  in  the  country  where  energy  delivered  to \nconsumers is 100% metered. In addition, its distribution system has a high 97.4% availability. It \nis  essential  that  every  unit  generated  and  delivered  is  accounted  for  and  audited  at  different \nvoltage  levels.  Himachal  Pradesh  has  achieved  more  than  90%  metering  on  the  distribution \ntransformers and on the feeders up to 33 kV, resulting in transmission and distribution losses of \na comparatively low 16.3% and aggregate technical and commercial losses of 26%.   \n \nThe power sector of Himachal Pradesh compares favorable to that of India as a whole, \n19. \nas shown in Table A2.1. However, the state still experiences power shortages due to the lack of \ngenerating capacity within the state. \n \n\nTable A2.1: \nSalient Village and Household Level Power Statistics \n\nItem \n\nVillage Electrification (%) \nHousehold Electrification (%) \nPer Capita Consumption (kWh) \n\n  kWh = kilowatt-hour. \n  Source: Ministry of Power, Government of India.  \n\nNational \nAverage \n86.6 \n55.8 \n 636.0 \n\nHimachal Pradesh \nAverage \n100.0 \n98.2 \n775.0 \n\n \n20. \nInstitutional Capacity. Given the investment plans for additional hydropower capacity in \nHimachal Pradesh, there are capacity development needs within HPPCL in project development, \nplanning,  and  construction  supervision.  Additional  needs  include  financial  management  and \nanalysis,  record  keeping,  environmental  impact  assessment,  and  environmental  management \nplanning.  HPERC\u2019s  capacity  development  objectives  are  to  support  enhancing  institutional \ncapacity,  and  to  promote  and  update  the  regulatory  framework  to  address  upcoming  sectoral \nissues  effectively,  especially  implementation  of  the  multiyear  tariff  regime  as  mandated  by  the \nElectricity Act, 2003. \n \n\n3. \n\nRegulatory Reform Process \n\nThe  Electricity  Act,  2003,  came  into  force  on  9  June  2003.  Himachal  Pradesh  already \n21. \nhad an established, functioning regulatory commission as of 2001, and has been issuing tariff \norders  since  then.  Annually,  HPSEB  and  other  licensees  are  required  to  petition  HPERC  for \ntariffs, and after consideration of stakeholders\u2019 inputs, HPERC rules on tariff applications. The \nresulting tariff orders are the key instrument of regulation and sector governance. Licensees are \nallowed to appeal the tariff orders, which may eventually be resolved by court rulings. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f44  Appendix 2 \n\n22. \nHPERC holds regular review meetings to monitor compliance with the various directives. \nIn  its  tariff  order  for  FY2006,  it  made  efforts  to  reduce  cross-subsidies  and  optimize  power \npurchase  costs  by  mandating  the  procurement  of  power  on  a  merit  order  dispatch  basis. \nHPERC has also taken steps toward complying with the provisions of the Electricity Act, 2003, \nfrom  a  regulatory  perspective,  including  issuing  and  monitoring  performance  standards  for \nHPSEB,  constituting  a  forum  for  addressing  consumer  grievances,  and  appointing  an \nombudsman. In June 2005, it issued open access regulations.  \n \n23. \nSector  Restructuring.  HPSEB  currently  owns  very  little  generation  (329  MW  total). \nHPPCL  is  to  own  and  operate  all  planned  state  sector  hydropower  development,  so  it  will \nbecome  the  state  generating  company.  The  corporatization  of  HPPCL,  supported  by  this \nproposed  MFF, \nfrom  HPSEB\u2019s  predominantly \ntransmission  and  distribution  operations,  and  an  eventual  transfer  of  HPSEB\u2019s  few  generating \nassets  to  HPPCL  is  envisioned.  Further  to  the  process  of HPSEB\u2019s  restructuring, HPSEB  has \ndrawn  up  a  proposal  for  its  unbundling.  The  first  step  is  to  unbundle  the  distinct  operations \ninternally  and  account  for  them  separately.  In  its  FY2007  and  FY2008  tariff  filings,  HPSEB \nunbundled  its  costs  into  generation,  transmission,  and  distribution  elements;  and  has  adopted \nan approach toward unbundling, identifying, and isolating assets, costs, and revenues.  \n \n\nthus  effectively  unbundles  generation \n\n4. \n\nState Investment Plan \n\nGOHP\u2019s investment plan involves allocating identified hydropower sites to state, central, \n24. \nand  private  sectors  for  development.  For  hydropower  plants  allotted  and  under  execution, \ncentral  public  sector  utilities  are  expected  to  take  up  about  3,100  MW,  private  sector  about \n1,800 MW, and the state sector about 1,200 MW, with about 400 MW to be developed jointly. \nAn additional 750 MW of mini-hydropower (< 5 MW per site) is to be developed under the lead \nof HIMURJA.  \n \n25. \nAt  the  state  level,  additional  new  projects  totaling  about  1,700  MW  will  be  allocated  to \nboth HPSEB and HPPCL, which will each develop six to seven new projects. Looking beyond \nthe projects for which financing has been secured, additional funding of several billion US dollar \nequivalent is needed for future development. \n \nHPSEB is preparing a transmission system master plan for the state. It will complete the \n26. \nplan by the end of 2008, including a schedule of capital expenditures for the next 5 years. This \nplan  will \nfor \naccommodating  the  anticipated  growth  in  hydropower  generation  capacity.  HPSEB  will  also \ncontinue its improvement of distribution system transformer metering to reach the goal of 100% \nmetering. \n \n\ninclude  substation  upgrades  and  additional \n\nlines  required \n\ntransmission \n\n5. \n\nPrivate Sector Participation \n\n27. \nGOHP  has  taken  several  initiatives  to  encourage  private  sector  participation  in \nhydropower development. Himachal Pradesh is among the few states that have streamlined and \ncrystallized the various procedures to minimize bottlenecks, and has come up with an investor-\nfriendly hydropower policy in place to attract private sector investment. The key features of the \npolicy are as follows: \n\nSelection  of  developers  via  memorandums  of  understanding  (MOUs)  is  allowed \nfor projects up to 100 MW. \nSelection  of  developers  via  international  competitive  bidding  is  applied  for \nprojects above 100 MW. \nNo  clearances  are  necessary  from  CEA  for  projects  selected  via  a  competitive \nbidding  process  costing  up  to  Rs2.5  billion,  provided  that  (a)  the  scheme  is \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 2 \n\n45 \n\nincluded  in  the  national  electricity  plan  as  notified  by  CEA,  and  (b)  the  site  for \nsetting  up  the  generating  stations  has  been  allocated  through  a  transparent \nbidding process in accordance with the guidelines issued by the Government. In \ncase of any other scheme, the Rs5 billion limit will apply.7  \nThe  secondary  energy  rate  is  at  a  par  with  primary  energy.  A  premium  is \nproposed on peak power. \nSimplification  of  process  of  transferring  clearances  to  independent  power \nproducers (IPPs). \nPermission of 100% foreign equity on automatic approval route, provided it does \nexceed Rs15 billion. \nTariff  determination  by  State  Electricity  Regulatory  Commission  or  CERC  as \napplicable. \n\nThe project developer will be required to provide a royalty in the form of free power from \n28. \nthe  project  to  GOHP  in  the  amount  of  12%  of  the  deliverable  energy  of  the  project  for  up  to \n12 years from the date of commercial operation of the project; at 18% of deliverable energy of \nthe  project  for  the  next  18  years  and  thereafter;  and  at  30%  of  the  deliverable  energy  for the \nbalance agreement period beyond 30 years.  \n \n29. \nfor  project(s)  being \nimplemented in each river valley. Activities of the authority during execution will be financed by \nthe project itself. For this purpose, the developer shall make a provision of 1.5% of total capital \ncost  in  the  detailed  project  report  other  than  the  funds  required  for  resettlement  and \nrehabilitation schemes and catchment area treatment plans. The authority\u2019s activities should be \nfinanced  from  the  1.5%  provision  proposed  in  the  detailed  project  report  and  not  from  free \npower royalty. Activities under the local area development authority are as follows: \n\nlocal  area  development  authority \n\nGOHP  will  constitute  a \n\noversee  the  restoration  of  facilities  adversely  affected  by  implementation  of  the \nproject; \noversee the implementation of rehabilitation and relief plan; \noversee the implementation of catchment area treatment plan and compensatory \nafforestation; \nlocal  development  activities  related  to  development  of  agriculture,  horticulture, \nanimal husbandry, health and forest development, and other social activities; and \nthe developer is to ensure minimum flow of 15% water immediately downstream \nof the dam to protect the rights of the local inhabitants for irrigation and drinking \nwater requirements. \n\n \n30. \nThe  project  developer  will  be  required  to  arrange  for  evacuation  of  power  from  the \nproject to the applicable HPSEB or Power Grid Corporation of India\u2019s substation (designated as \nthe  interconnection  point).  For  evacuation  of  power  beyond  the  interconnection  point,  the \ndeveloper shall work with HPSEB or Power Grid Corporation of India as applicable to arrange a \nsuitable integrated transmission system at mutually agreed wheeling charges. \n\n                                                 \n7  According to the Electricity Act, 2003, any generating company can establish, operate, and maintain a generating \nstation without obtaining a license if it complies with the technical standards relating to grid connectivity specified \nby CEA. However, certain clearances and approvals are required for taking up hydropower projects.  \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n ORGANIZATION STRUCTURE OF THE IMPLEMENTING AGENCY  \n \nHimachal Pradesh Power Corporation Limited \n\nChairman \n\nManaging Director \n\nCompany Secretary \n\n4\n6\n \n \n \n \n \n\nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n3\n\ni\n\n \n\nDirector/General Manager \n(Personnel) \n\nDirector/General Manager \n(Finance)\n\nDirector (Civil) \n\nDirector (Electrical) \n\n- Personnel & \nAdministration I \n(land acquisition, \nR&R, legal) \n- Administration \nand human \nresources, policy \nand training \n\n- Accounts, \nTaxation, Cash \nBook & Banks  \n- External \nFunding, Budget, \nContracts, \nConcurrence and \nCost \n- Audit \n\n- Civil Design \nDepartment \n- Corporate \nContract & \nProcurement \nDepartment \n- Corporate \nDesign & Quality \nControl \nDepartment \n\nProjects Divisions \n(PMUs) \n(Kashang, Sawra \nKuddu, Sainj, \nShongtong \nKarcham and \nother projects) \n\n \n\nFor each Project: \nConstruction, Contract, \nProcurement, \nMonitoring & Cost \nControl, Erection & \nCommissioning, \nEnvironment, R&R, \nFinance and Personnel\n\n- Electrical Design \nDepartment \n- Electrical \nContracts \nDepartment \nQuality Assurance, \nInspection & \nControl \nDepartment \n- Information \nTechnology & \nCommunications \n- Corporate \nPlanning \n- Corporate \nMonitoring \n\n \n \n \n \nPMU = project management unit, R&R = resettlement and rehabilitation \nSource: Himachal Pradesh Power Corporation Limited.   \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 4 \n\n47 \n\nEXTERNAL ASSISTANCE TO THE POWER SECTOR  \n\n \n1. \nIndia\u2019s  power  sector  has  received  a  major  portion  of  its  external  assistance  from  the \nJapan  Bank  for  International  Cooperation,  World  Bank,  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB), \nDepartment  for  International  Development  of  the  United  Kingdom,  German  development \ncooperation  through  KfW,  United  States  Agency  for  International  Development,  and  the \nCanadian  International  Development  Agency.

The  capacity \ndevelopment component contains a main subcomponent focusing on addressing constraints at \nthe  Implementing  Agency  (IA)  level.  It  is  designed  to  address  weaknesses  identified  by  the \nprocurement capacity assessment (Supplementary Appendix E) and the financial management \nassessment  (Supplementary  Appendix  D).  The  main  focus  will  be  on  project  preparation, \nimplementation,  and  management,  including  (i) helping  the  Executing  Agency  prepare  future \nprojects; (ii) implementing and administering approved projects; and (iii) monitoring, reviewing, \nevaluating,  and  reporting  on  program  and  project  implementation.  This  includes  project \nplanning,  construction  supervision,  contract  management,  procurement,  disbursements, \nsafeguards compliance, and monitoring and reporting systems. It will also include setting up the \nrequisite  project  management  units  within  Himachal  Pradesh  Power  Corporation  Limited \n(HPPCL). Financial management and accountability will be another major focus. This includes \nimproved accounting and auditing systems, while incorporating adequate financial management \nstandards to ensure fiduciary oversight of disbursed funds. A third focus will be the knowledge \ntransfer required for compliance with Asian Development Bank (ADB) policies and procedures, \nas none of the agencies have experience with ADB policies. \n \nthe  capacity  development \n2. \ncomponent will include corporate development assistance to HPPCL. There will be support for \nformulating an effective organizational structure with well-functioning project management units \nencompassing  the  duties,  responsibilities,  lines  of  supervision,  and  limits  of  authority  for  all \nofficers,  managers,  and  other  staff.  Support  will  include  hardware  and  software  installation, \npolicy reformulation, and promoting private sector participation modalities. Training in the clean \ndevelopment mechanism (CDM) and public\u2013private partnership (PPP) modalities will round out \nHPPCL\u2019s  functional  expertise  as  the  state\u2019s  power  generation  company.  HPPCL  will  thus  be \ntransformed into a commercially oriented entity with a functioning board of directors supported \nby operating teams, finance, and administration. \n \n3. \nBecause of the large amount of hydropower capacity additions earmarked for Himachal \nPradesh, Himachal Pradesh State Electricity Board (HPSEB), the state\u2019s transmission utility, is \nresponsible for the design and construction of the evacuation systems from hydropower projects \nto  the  transmission  system,  as  well  as  ensuring  adequate  transmission  capacity.  Therefore, \nthere is a need for building capacity at HPSEB to introduce modern, computerized accounting \nsystems and management information systems (MIS) to ensure that HPSEB is able to manage \nand  report  on  its  operational  activities  properly.  Taking  this  into  account  under  the  capacity \nbuilding  component  of  the  MFF,  it  was  agreed  to  assist  HPSEB  in  acquiring  an  enterprise \nresource planning solution to cover all its future computer accounting and MIS applications; and \nto finance the purchase of software, hardware, training, and initial system maintenance. HPSEB \nhas conducted the initial steps, such as carrying out a review of HPSEB\u2019s financial accounting \nand  management  information  system  requirements  with  particular  emphasis  on  project \naccounting  and  project  management  systems,  financial  management,  financial  reporting,  and \ninformation  requirements  of  Himachal  Pradesh  Electricity  Regulatory  Commission  (HPERC). \nHPSEB  is  in  the  process  of  developing  the  tendering  documents.  For  this  subcomponent, \nHPSEB  will  be  the  IA  and  will  provide  office  space  and  counterpart  staff  for  implementation. \nHPSEB  will  appoint  a  suitably  qualified  project  manager  to  manage  implementation  of  the \nenterprise resource planning solution.

Methodology and Major Assumptions \n \n1. \nThe financial analysis of the proposed subprojects under tranche 1 has been carried out \nin accordance with  Financial Management and  Analysis of Projects of the Asian Development \nBank (ADB).1 \n \n2. \nAll  financial  costs  and  benefits  have  been  expressed  in  constant  2008  prices.  Cost \nstreams  used  for  financial  internal  rate  of  return  (FIRR)  determination,  i.e.,  capital  investment \nand  operations  and  maintenance,  reflect  the  costs  of  delivering  the  estimated  benefits.  The \ncurrent methodology to calculate tariffs for energy sales of hydropower generating stations was \nused  to  estimate  the  financial  benefits.  The  weighted  average  cost  of  capital  (WACC)  of \nHimachal  Pradesh  Power  Corporation  Limited  (HPPCL)  was  calculated  for  the  proposed \nsubprojects  under  tranche  1  and  compared  with  the  project  FIRRs  to  ascertain  the  financial \nviability of the subprojects. The sensitivity of the FIRR to adverse movements in the underlying \nassumptions  was  also  assessed.  Based  on  this  analysis,  it  is  concluded  that  the  subprojects \nunder tranche 1 are financially viable.  \n \nWhile  tranche  1  of  the  MFF  will  finance  the  110  megawatt  (MW)  Sawra  Kuddu \n3. \nhydropower project except for the barrage, intake and desilting basin,2 and the civil works for the \n195  MW  Integrated  Kashang  hydropower  project,  the  evaluation  must  include  the  total  project \ncosts.  Therefore,  costs  include  all  civil  works,  electrical  and  mechanical  works,  resettlement, \nand  environmental  costs  associated  with  each  hydropower  subproject.  Financial  viability  was \nexamined by comparing the incremental costs and benefits of the with- and without-investment \nscenarios.  The  incremental  benefits  arise  through  the  increased  generation  of  power.  It  is \nassumed that the subprojects will have a 30-year economic life and residual value of 33% of the \noriginal investment at the end of the 20-year evaluation period. \n \n4. \nThe  tariff  principles  set  by  the  regulatory  agency,  Central  Electric  Regulatory \nCommission (CERC) in March 2004 allow HPPCL to pass through full cost recovery of the loan \ncapital  (assuming  a  debt\u2013equity  ratio  of  70:30);  depreciation  (to  cover  principal  repayments); \nreturn  on  equity  (14%);  operation  and  maintenance  expenses  (based  on  1.5%  of  investment \ncosts);  and  interest  on  loans  and  working  capital.  The  above  tariff  revenue  streams  are \nconverted to real terms by adjusting for domestic inflation.  \n \n5. \nWhile  tranche  1  subprojects  are  also  expected  to  produce  positive  environmental \nbenefits (from the clean development mechanism [CDM]), primarily in relation to the displaced \nelectricity generation from thermal sources, these have been excluded from the analysis.   \n \nB. \n \n6. \nTo  compute  the  WACC,  it  is  assumed  that  the  financing  sources  would  consist  of \ngovernment  of  Himachal  Pradesh  (GOHP)  equity  contributions  and  foreign  loans.  The  cost  of \nHPPCL\u2019s equity is calculated at 14% as allowed by CERC tariff norms for pass-through in the \ntariff  calculation.  The  analysis  assumes  that  the  ADB  loan  is  passed  through  to  GOHP  and \nHPPCL in Indian rupees with interest rate including allowance for the Government\u2019s guarantee \n\nCalculation Weighted Average Cost of Capital  \n\n                                                 \n1 Asian Development Bank. 2005.

The WACC is calculated on a pre-tax basis as taxes (33.6% \nof net profits)3 are allowed as a pass-through in the CERC regulations. The other assumption is \ndomestic inflation rate of 5.0%. Table A12.1 shows that the average WACC for the hydropower \ngenerating projects, both Kashang and Sawra Kuddu, is 3.6%.4 \n \n\nTable A12.1: Weighted Average Cost of Capital\u2014Kashang Subproject  \n(%) \n\n \n\nEquity \n89.0 \n30.0 \n14.0 \n0.0 \n14.0 \n5.0 \n8.6 \n2.6 \n\nADB Loan \n208.0 \n70.0 \n6.6 \n0.0 \n6.6 \n5.0 \n1.5 \n1.1 \n\nSource \nAmount ($ million) \nWeighting \nNominal Cost \nTax Rate \nTax Adjusted Nominal Cost \nInflation Rate \nReal Cost  \nWeighted  WACC \nADB = Asian Development Bank, WACC = weighted average cost of capital. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nC. \nAnalyses \n \n7. \nThe FIRR is calculated at 7.0% for the Sawra Kuddu project and 6.7% for the Kashang \nintegrated project. These rates for the individual projects compare favorably with the estimated \nvalue of WACC at 3.6%, substantiating the financial viability of the tranche 1 subprojects.   \n \n\nCalculation of Financial Internal Rate of Return, Risk Assessment, and Sensitivity \n\n \n \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n3.6% \n\n1. \n\nRisk Assessment and Sensitivity Analyses \n\n  \n\nExternal Risks. Regulatory or tariff revision risk for the tranche 1 subprojects is minimal. \n8. \nThe  current  tariff  has  taken  the  investment  plan  into  account  and,  if  necessary,  regulated \nentities  can  submit  revised  asset  capitalization  and  financing  plans  and  Himachal  Pradesh \nElectricity Regulatory Commission (HPERC)5 will adjust the determination accordingly. There is \nno risk of downward revision since tariffs will not be changed unless HPERC is petitioned by the \nregulated entities to do so. Volume (i.e., demand) risk is minimal since the tariff allows for the \nbulk of revenues to be provided based on the capacity availability index, and Himachal Pradesh \nState Electricity Board (HPSEB) plants have exceeded the minimum 90% availability in the past, \naveraging  92%  available  capacity  over  the  last  5  years.  Geopolitical  and  political  risks  are \npresent for all projects in India. However, the nature of the investments and the overall shortage \nof  power  in  India  diversify  this  risk.  Therefore,  the  overall  risk  to  the  financial  sustainability  of \nHPPCL is deemed to be minimal. \n \n9. \nProject  Specific  Risks.  Financial  risks  at  subproject  level  include  the  following:  (i) an \nincrease  in  the  price  of  civil  works  and  equipment,  (ii)  delays  in  project  implementation,  and \n(iii) failure  to  have  access  to  necessary  counterpart  funds.  These  risks  are  considered  low \nsince (i) the cost estimates were based on recent tenders received, and advance procurement \nwill reduce the time between loan effectiveness and disbursement; (ii) HPPCL\u2019s implementation \ncapacity  (based  on  projects  undertaken  by  HPSEB)  has  been  proven  in  recent  project \n                                                 \n3 Energy projects also attract a tax holiday of 10 years.  \n4 The WACC is the same for the Sawra Kuddu subproject, as the ratio of ADB loans to equity is also 70:30. \n5   Provided  that  the  increases  in  costs  can  be  substantiated,  rather  than  simply  cost  overruns  as  a  result  of  poor \n\nmanagement and construction practices. \n\n \n\n\f60 \n\nAppendix 12 \n\nimplementation, with further support to be provided under the capacity development component; \nand  (iii)  HPPCL\u2019s  financial  projections  demonstrate  satisfactory  cash  flows  throughout  the \nforecast  period  to  meet  the  repayment  of  debt  associated  with  the  investments,  once  projects \nare commissioned.  \n \n10. \nSensitivity  Analyses.  Separate analyses were carried out to examine the sensitivity of \nthe  FIRR  and  financial  net  present  value  to  adverse  changes  in  key  variables.  The  variables \nconsidered for the sensitivity analyses were a 10% increase in capital costs, a 10% increase in \noperation and maintenance costs, and a 10% decrease in revenues (allowable costs). Project-\nspecific  tests  include  a  2-year  implementation  delay  with  a  20%  increase  in  costs,  and  no \nallowance for residual values.  \n \nTables A12.2 and A12.3 demonstrate that the results are robust for each subproject with \n11. \nthe sensitivities exceeding the WACC. The project is most sensitive to cost overruns and delays. \nHowever, justifiable capital cost increases will be allowed by HPERC to be passed through into \nthe tariff, so this risk is minimized where justifiable cost increases and delays are incurred. \n\n \nTable A12.2: FIRR Sensitivity Analyses\u2014Sawra Kuddu Subproject \n\n \n \n \n\nSensitivity Analyses \nBase Case \nCapital \nOperating \nBenefits \nAll the above \nTwo-year delay plus 20% increase capital cost \nNo residual value \nWACC \n( ) = negative. \nFIRR = financial internal rate of return; FNPV = financial net present value, SI = sensitivity indicator; SV = switching \nvalue; WACC = weighted average cost of capital. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n\nFNPV \n(Rs million) \n1,583.7  \n1,215.8  \n1,498.1  \n971.8  \n518.3  \n497.8  \n943.6  \n  \n\nSV \n(%) \n  \n33.9 \n203.3 \n(26.6) \n  \n  \n  \n  \n\nFIRR \n(%) \n7.0 \n6.0 \n6.9 \n5.7 \n4.7 \n4.5 \n6.1 \n3.6 \n\nSI \n(%) \n  \n14.2 \n2.4 \n18.1 \n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n+10 \n+10 \n\u201310 \n \n\n  \n\n  \n\nTable A12.3: FIRR Sensitivity Analyses\u2014Kashang Subproject \n\n \n \n \n\nFNPV \n(Rs million) \n2,780.4  \n2,075.2  \n2,615.7  \n1,632.5  \n762.6  \n712.0  \n1,549.3  \n\n+10 \n+10 \n\u201310 \n \n\nSensitivity Analyses \nBase Case \nCapital \nOperating \nBenefits \nAll the above \nTwo-year delay plus 20% increase capital cost \nNo residual value \nWACC \n( ) = negative. \nFIRR = financial internal rate of return; FNPV = financial net present value, SI = sensitivity indicator; SV = switching \nvalue; WACC = weighted average cost of capital. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n  \n \n \n\nSV \n(%) \n  \n31.7 \n183.7 \n(24.8) \n  \n  \n  \n  \n\nFIRR \n(%) \n6.7 \n5.8 \n6.6 \n5.5 \n4.4 \n4.2 \n5.7 \n3.6 \n\nSI \n(%) \n  \n14.5 \n2.5 \n18.6 \n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 13 \n\n61 \n\nSUMMARY OF ECONOMIC ANALYSIS \n\nBackground and Approach \n\n \nA. \n \n1. \nto be funded from tranche 1. Analysis sought to determine and verify: \n\nEconomic analysis was undertaken to determine economic viability for each subproject \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nelectricity demand and supply projections;  \nthe  presence  of  tranche  1  subprojects  on  the  regional  and  national  least-cost \nsystem expansion paths; \neconomic cost benefit analysis of tranche 1 subprojects, including sensitivities to \nkey variables; and \ndistribution of costs and benefits among stakeholders.  \n\n \n2. \nEconomic  benefits  will  accrue  from  incremental  electricity  consumption  and  from \ndisplacement  of  more  expensive  sources  of  energy.  Environmental  benefits  will  also  be \nachieved from the displacement of fossil fuel sources. Although only the first stage of Kashang \nis  included  in  tranche  1  funding,  economic  analysis  for  the  entire  Kashang  subproject  was \nundertaken, rather than for the first stage as a stand-alone project. \n \nB. \n\nCalculation of Economic Internal Rate of Return, Risk Assessment, and Sensitivity \nAnalyses \n\n \n3. \nProgram Costs. All costs and benefits have been expressed in constant 2007 prices. \nThe  domestic  price  numeraire  was  used;  tradable  inputs  were  valued  at  their  border  price \nequivalent  value  and  were  converted  to  domestic  equivalents  using  an  estimated  standard \nexchange rate factor of 1.04. Capital costs included physical contingencies, but excluded taxes, \nprice  contingencies,  and  financial  charges  during  construction.  The  incremental  costs  and \nbenefits  of  the  tranche  1  subprojects  were  estimated  by  comparing  with-  and  without-project \nscenarios.  Electricity  generated  from  the  subprojects  was  assumed  to  be  consumed  within \nHimachal Pradesh, which is located within the northern region of the national grid. \n\n \n\nProgram Benefits. Electricity generated from the subprojects will be used to meet any \n4. \nunserved  demand  for  electricity  in  Himachal  Pradesh.  If  there  is  no  unserved  demand  in \nHimachal  Pradesh,  electricity  from  the  subprojects  will  be  sold  into  the  northern  region  of  the \nnational  grid  where  it  will  be  used  to  meet  unserved  demand.  When  there  is  no  unserved \ndemand  in  the  northern  region,  electricity  generated  from  the  subprojects  will  be  used  to \ndisplace more expensive sources of generation\u2014primarily a diesel captive plant and coal-fired \nplant that is being used for peaking duties. Non-incremental outputs from the subprojects were \nvalued  at  the  resource  cost  savings  that  would  accrue  if  the  subprojects  were  to  proceed.  In \nvaluing  the  output  from  the  subprojects,  it  was  assumed  that  most  captive  generation  will  be \ndisplaced before coal-fired generation from the grid is displaced.  \n \n5. \nIncremental  outputs  were  valued  using  Himachal  Pradesh  and  northern  region \nconsumers\u2019  estimated  willingness  to  pay  for  incremental  consumption,  adjusted  for  medium \nvoltage  and  low  voltage  losses  as  appropriate.  Demand  functions  relating  energy  price  to \nenergy  demand  were  estimated  for  each  of  the  three  main  consumer  sectors  in  Himachal \nPradesh  (domestic,  industrial,  and  commercial)  and  the  four  main  consumer  sectors  in  the \n\n \n\n\f62 \n\nAppendix 13 \n\nnorthern  region  (domestic,  industrial,  commercial,  and  agricultural),  following  the  methodology \noutlined in Measuring Willingness to Pay for Electricity1 of the Asian Development Bank (ADB).  \n \n6. \nTranche  1  subprojects  are  also  expected  to  produce  positive  environmental  benefits, \nprimarily in relation to the displaced electricity generation from thermal sources. Benefits have \nonly  been  quantified  as  a  sensitivity  case,  using  a  realistic  estimate  for  the  value  of  carbon \nemission  reduction  credits  that  the  subprojects  could  possibly  attract  in  the  international \nmarketplace  if  an  application  for  clean  development  mechanism  (CDM)  certification  was \nsuccessful. A conservative value of $10 per credit was used (i.e., $10 per ton of certified carbon \ndioxide emissions avoided) to reflect uncertainty over credit price and over the continuation of \nthe CDM program beyond 2012. \n \nEstimation of Economic Internal Rate of Return. A period of 25 years was used for \n7. \neconomic  evaluation.  Investment  is  assumed  to  take  place  in  the  period  2008\u20132014,  and \nbenefits  are  assumed  to  be  realized  from  2013.  A  residual  value  was  assumed,  based  on  an \neconomic asset life of 50 years. Detailed cost\u2013benefit calculations show that the subprojects are \nexpected  to  deliver  significant  economic  benefits.  Kashang  delivers  an  estimated  economic \ninternal rate of return (EIRR) of 17.8% and Sawra Kuddu delivers an estimated EIRR of 20.7%.  \nThe combined EIRR is estimated to be 18.7% (Table A13.1). \n\n                                                 \n1 P.

The  analysis  demonstrates  that  the \neconomic  impact  of  a  rockfall  on  the  intake  structure  at  Kashang  is  negative,  but  the  EIRR \nwould  still  be  well  in  excess  of  the  12%  hurdle  rate.

The distribution of costs and benefits among stakeholders was \n9. \nassessed by comparing financial costs and benefits to economic costs and benefits. Overall, the \neconomic  net  present  value  exceeds  the  financial  net  present  value  by  Rs12.3 million. \nConsumers are the greatest beneficiary, with net benefits of about Rs9.6 million. Unskilled labor \nbenefits by about Rs0.1 million and India\u2019s economy benefits by about Rs2.7 million. Himachal \nPradesh  Power  Corporation  Limited  (HPPCL)  is  the  net  loser  in  this  analysis\u2014its  weighted \naverage  cost  of  capital,  and  therefore  its  expected  financial  internal  rate  of  internal  on  the \ninvestment, are well below the 12% discount rate used in the analysis. \n \nC. \n \n10. \nThe economic analysis confirms that both subprojects in the first tranche are in the path \nof  the  least-cost  expansion  plan  for  India  and  are  economically  viable.  Sensitivity  analysis \ndemonstrates  that  the  expected  economic  performance  is  robust.  From  an  economic \nperspective, tranche 1 investment should proceed. \n\nConclusion \n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n\n8\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n\n \n\n\fAppendix 14 \n\n65 \n\nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY \n\nCountry/Project Title: India: Himachal Pradesh Clean Energy Development Investment Program \n\n \nLending/Financing \nModality: \n \n\n \n\nMultitranche Financing Facility \n\nDepartment/ \nDivision: \n\n \n\nSouth Asia Department \nEnergy Division \n \n\nI. \n\nPOVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\nA.  Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \n \nThe power sector has great potential to contribute to economic development and social well-being, but infrastructure facilities \nneed to be expanded and managed more effectively to ensure consistent economic growth in India. Development of the power \nsector  is  connected  to  poverty  reduction.  Clean  power  development  ensures  that  the  poor  will  benefit,  as  they  bear  a  larger \nshare  of  the  adverse  impacts  of  pollution  and  environmental  degradation.  In  addition,  stable  electricity  supplies  promote \nbusiness expansion and increase employment opportunities, which can have a positive impact on reducing poverty. \n \nPolicy reforms that lead to sector sustainability can free up resources for other pro-poor initiatives. Policy reforms that will lead \nto  private  sector  development  in  the  sector  will  also  support  improvements  in  service  accountability,  transparency,  and \naccessibility. \n \nMore  specifically,  the  Program  will  contribute  to  economic  development,  health,  and  education  in  India  through  expanded \npower supplies; and  will develop clean energy  by supporting selected investments in hydropower  generation and associated \ntransmission system expansion to facilitate sector sustainability and protect the environment. \n \nAs Himachal Pradesh is 100% electrified, the local population  will benefit from a more reliable power  supply. Electricity from \nthe proposed hydropower plants under the Investment Program will go directly to the local grid, helping to fulfill local demand \nfor greater energy resources. The overall objective of expanding clean energy generation will contribute to state level economic \ndevelopment on several fronts.  \n \nFinally, social services in Himachal Pradesh will improve as poor and vulnerable consumers (including hospitals, schools, and \nother social utilities) that are often hardest hit by inadequate power supply, load shedding, and poor power quality, will benefit \ndirectly from the Investment Program. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                  Targeting Classification:  General Intervention \n1.  Key Issues  \nHimachal  Pradesh  is  quite  a  rich  state,  compared  to  the  rest  of  the  country.  Having  obtained  the  status  of  \u201ctribal\u201d  state,  its \npopulation has benefited from investments and subsidies form the central Government. In addition, the state government has \napproved  a  series  of  pro-poor  policies,  including  the  abolition  of  tenancy,  which  resulted  in  a  redistribution  of  land  to  the \nlandless to fight exploitation of labor and increase the productivity of the land. \n \nNow, 100% of the Himachal Pradesh population owns land (with the exception of Nepali labor) and most of them have invested \nin the highly profitable apple orchards business. \n \nThe  local  population  will  still  benefit  from  the  Project,  as  it  will  provide  them  with  a  more  secure  and  reliable  source  of \nelectricity.  In  addition,  in  its  hydropower  policy a,  the  government  of  Himachal  Pradesh  provided  that  1.5%  of  the  Program\u2019s \ntotal  cost  would  go  back  to  the  affected  communities,  which  will  decide  (in  a  fully  participatory  way)  how  to  use  it  for \nsocioeconomic development activities. \n \nContractors are expected to hire skilled and unskilled workers for a period of 10 years for civil works. There will also be jobs \navailable  beyond  the  construction  phase  throughout  the  projects\u2019  life  cycles.  Nonetheless,  as  labor  comes  usually  from  the \nlandless segment of the population, the number of people hired locally is expected to be limited.  \n \n2. Design Features  \nNo  direct  impact  on  poverty  is  envisaged  to  occur  as  result  of  the  implementation  of  this  Program.  Nonetheless,  it  will  have \nindirect impacts on both Himachal Pradesh and India as a whole. \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f66 \n\nAppendix 14 \n\nII. \n\nSOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\nA.    Findings of Social Analysis  \n \nProject-affected  communities  are  expected  to  be  impacted  both  negatively  (resettlement  and  environmental  impacts)  and \npositively (job opportunities and the opportunity to implement local socioeconomic development programs financed through the \n1.5% allocated by the program authorities). In addition, health and education conditions and facilities are expected to improve \nin  Himachal  Pradesh  as  well  as  the  rest  of  the  country  served  by  the  northern  grid,  because  of  access  to  more  reliable \nelectricity. \n \n\nB.  Consultation and Participation \n\n1.  Provide a summary of the consultation and participation process during the project preparation. \n \nAs an integral part of the safeguards planning, affected communities and affected persons were directly and fully involved in \nthe project preparation and during the design. All stakeholders were informed and the stream of information will continue during \nthe implementation of the Program. Consultations were held to ensure participation and minimization of the negative impacts. \nMoreover, the affected communities will be in charge of deciding how to spend the 1.5% of the project cost for the development \nof socioeconomic schemes to be implemented locally. \n \n2.  What level of consultation and participation (C&P) is envisaged during the project implementation and monitoring?  \n\n  Information sharing       \n\n  Consultation      \n\n  Collaborative decision making     \n\n Empowerment \n\n No  \n\n Yes    \n\n \n3.

If no, explain why.  \n \nC&P was considered as a part of the more extensive resettlement planning exercise. Local communities and affected persons \nwere consulted throughout the preparation process to minimize impacts, ensure social acceptance, and increase equitability. \nThe process will continue during the implementation of the Program. Views and concerns of all stakeholders will be taken into \nconsideration and addressed whenever feasible. Finally, local customs, religious practices, and traditional activities have been \nconsidered  as  a  fully  integrated  part  of  the  preparation  process  to  avoid  discrimination  and/or  disruption  of  activities,  as \nminimization measures. \n \n\nC.   Gender and Development \n\n1.  Key Issues.  \nNo  particular  issue  is  expected  to  arise  from  implementation  of  the  Program.

The  Program  initially  will \nsupport  selected  investments  in  hydropower  generation  and  associated  transmission  system \nexpansion  to  facilitate  sector  sustainability.  It  will  include  the  following  components;  (i)  Sawra \nKuddu  Hydroelectric  Project,  111  megawatts  (MW);  (ii)  Kashang  Hydroelectric  Plant,  195  MW \n(to be built in stages over two tranches); (iii) Sainj Hydroelectric Plant, 100 MW; (v) Shongtong \nKarcham  Hydroelectric  Plant,  402  MW;  and  (vi)  the  Capacity  Development  Program  for \nHimachal  Pradesh  Power  Corporation  Limited  (HPPCL)  and  other  sector  agencies.  The \nhydropower development components will provide a total capacity of 745 MW with a combined \ngeneration  of  3,045  gigawatt-hours  (GWh)/year  at  90%  dependability.  The  capacity \ndevelopment  program  will  provide  support  for  development  of  the  operating  departments, \ne.g., technical,  finance  and  accounting,  environment  and  social,  procurement,  personnel,  and \nfor  carrying  out  specific  tasks  such  as  physical  investments  and  sector  reforms  and \nrestructuring. The first tranche will cover construction of the Sawra Kuddu project, the civil works \nfor the Kashang project, and the capacity development component.  \n\n2. \nThe  summary  resettlement  plans  are  prepared  for  first  tranche  subprojects\u2014Sawra \nKuddu  and  the  civil  works  of  Kashang.  The  Sawra  Kuddu  project  is  located  in  the  district  of \nShimla and the Kashang subproject is in the district of Kinnaur. The impact on land acquisition \nand  resettlement  for  the  Kashang  subproject  is  insignificant,  so  a  short  resettlement  plan  was \nprepared. The impact for Sawra Kuddu is significant, so a full resettlement plan was prepared. \nBoth the resettlement plans are based on the final engineering design, according to the detailed \nproject reports. Efforts have been made by the engineering team to minimize resettlement.  \n\nB. \n\nImpact on Land Acquisition and Resettlement \n\n3. \nThe  total  private  land  required  for  acquisition  is  49.42  hectares  (ha),  out  of  which \n45.75 ha  is  required  for  Sawra  Kuddu  and  3.67  ha  for  Kashang  (stage  1).  A  census  and \nsocioeconomic  survey  was  conducted  in  the  subproject  affected  area  to  assess  the  impact.  A \ntotal  of  193  households  will  be  affected.  Kashang  stage  1  will  affect  30 households  and \nSawra Kuddu  will  impact  165  households.  Only  two  residential  structures  will  be  affected  in \nSawra  Kuddu;  the  Kashang  subproject  will  not  affect  any  structures.  All  households  are \ntitleholders. There will be no impact on community and cultural property. A total of 2,446 trees \nwill be affected. In Sawra Kuddu, 48 sharecroppers and agricultural laborers will be affected. A \ntotal of 878 persons and 50 vulnerable households will be affected. Although recognized tribes \nand castes will be affected, they will not be considered indigenous peoples as defined within the \nPolicy  on  Indigenous  Peoples  (1998)  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB).  Therefore,  no \nindigenous peoples development plan (IPDP) is prepared for the subprojects. These tribes and \ncastes have been considered vulnerable, and additional assistance has been provided for in the \nresettlement plan. There will be no negative impact on women; rather, women will benefit from \nthe Program.

About 32 ha of land have already been acquired and compensation for \nthe land has been disbursed to the affected persons. The assessment of land and identification \nof  affected  persons  for  the  remaining  13.75  ha  of  land  is  in  process\u2014section  4  and  other \nrelevant  sections  of  the  Land  Acquisition  Act,  1894,  have  been  initiated  for  this  purpose. \nCompensation  for  the  remaining  land  has  been  fixed  by  the  EA  through  its  designated  land \nacquisition officer, and disbursement for the remaining land is due. The compensation is based \non the market rate, which is at replacement value. \n \nC. \n \n5. \nThe policy framework and entitlements for the Program are based on national laws\u2014the \nLand Acquisition Act, 1894 (amended in 1984), and the national rehabilitation and resettlement \npolicy1\u2014and ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy (1995) and Policy on Indigenous Peoples. \nThe Himachal Pradesh hydropower policy2 is also considered. The core involuntary resettlement \nprinciples for the Program to be followed for each subproject, including tranche 1 subprojects, \nare: (i) land acquisition and other involuntary resettlement impacts will be avoided or minimized, \nexploring  all  viable  alternative  subproject  designs;  (ii)  where  unavoidable,  time-bound \nresettlement plans will be prepared and affected persons will be assisted in improving or at least \nregaining  their  pre-program  standard  of  living;  (iii)  consultation  with  affected  persons  on \ncompensation,  disclosure  of  resettlement  information  to  affected  persons,  and  participation  of \naffected  persons  in  planning  and  implementing  subprojects,  will  be  ensured;  (iv)  vulnerable \ngroups  will  be  provided  special  assistance;  (v)  compensation  will  be  paid  to  affected  persons, \nincluding  non-titled  persons  (e.g.,  informal  dwellers  and/or  squatters,  and  encroachers),  for \nacquired  assets  at  replacement  rates;  (vi)  compensation  will  be  paid  and  resettlement \n                                                 \n1 Government of India. 2007.

Different consultative techniques were used with \nstakeholders,  including  in-depth  interviews,  public  meetings,  and  group  discussions.  To \nunderstand  the  socioeconomic  profile  of  the  affected  persons,  questionnaires  were  designed \nand  information  was  collected  from  the  affected  persons  on  a  one-to-one  basis.  Focus  group \ndiscussions  are  also  in  progress  in  the  project  influence  areas.  For  the  Kashang  stage  1 \nsubproject,  focus  group  discussions  were  conducted  at  Pangi  village  and  Reckong  Peo  in \nNovember  2007;  30  people  participated  in  the  consultation  and  shared  their  views.  Census \nsurveys  of  all  30  affected  households  were  conducted  on  a  one-to-one  basis.  For  the  Sawra \nKuddu subproject, around 100 affected households have been consulted as part of the census \nsurvey. Additionally, 98 households were surveyed as part of a sample socioeconomic survey in \nNovember and December 2007 in the subproject-affected zone. Focus group discussions were \nconducted  at  rural  and  urban  areas  of  the  Sawra  Kuddu  subproject  area,  such  as  Mandhol \nvillage (6 December 2007), Sari village (28 November 2007), Jhalta Chowri (3 December 2007), \nHatkoti  town  (29  November  2007),  Bharot  village  (30  November  2007),  Mandal  (1  December \n2007),  and  Mungra  village  (2  December  2007).  About  85  participants  representing  various \ngroups participated in the consultations. Consultations have also been carried out with special \nemphasis on the vulnerable groups. Most of the people are aware of the proposed Program and \nexpressed  their  cooperation  for  smooth  implementation  of  the  subproject.

The  IA  will \nhave  a  specific  PMU  and  there  will  be  different  PIUs.  Each  of  the  component  hydropower \nprojects  will  be  implemented  independently  through  the  PIUs.  Keeping  in  view  the  capacity  of \nHPPCL,  it  is  proposed  that  an  environment  and  social  management  unit  be  set  up  within  the \nPMU,  along  with  other  engineering  units,  to  address  environmental  and  social  issues  of  the \nProgram. A nongovernment organization (NGO) will oversee implementation of the resettlement \nplan,  along  with  implementation  of  resettlement  and  rehabilitation  assistance.

All activities related to land acquisition and resettlement must \nbe  planned  to  ensure  that  compensation  is  paid  prior  to  displacement  and  commencement  of \ncivil  works.  Public  consultation,  international  monitoring,  and  grievance  redress  will  be \nundertaken  intermittently  throughout  each  subproject\u2019s  duration.  However,  the  schedule  is \nsubject  to  modification  depending  on  the  progress  of  project  activities.  As  part  of  advance \nactions,  the  EA  will  establish  the  PMU,  PIU,  environment  and  social  management  unit,  and \ngrievance  redress  committee;  and  appoint  an  NGO  for  resettlement  implementation.
