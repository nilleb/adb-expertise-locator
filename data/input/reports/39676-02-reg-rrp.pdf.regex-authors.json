It is also an integral part of the \nregional road network in Central Asia linking the Kyrgyz Republic, \nPRC,  Tajikistan,  Afghanistan,  Uzbekistan,  and  Turkmenistan. \nMore  broadly,  it  is  a  part  of  the  Asian  highway  network \nconnecting,  through  Afghanistan,  the  ocean  ports  of  Iran  and \nPakistan  to  Kazakhstan  and  the  Russian  Federation.  The \nimmediate  project  area  where  the  road  sections  are  to  be \nimproved  is  in  the  Rash  Valley  northeast  of  Dushanbe  in \nTajikistan,  and  Alay  Valley  southwest  of  Osh  in  the  Kyrgyz \nRepublic. The project road has become a bottleneck for regional \ntrade  and  transport  due  to  its  poor  condition  and  lack  of \nmaintenance. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) is assisting in \nrehabilitation of 217 km of this corridor in Tajikistan and 58 km in \nthe Kyrgyz Republic. \n \nThe Project will improve the Corridor\u2019s missing links. Its outputs \ninclude (i) improved 263 km of the two-lane road from Sary Tash \nin the Kyrgyz Republic to Nimich in Tajikistan (about 142 km from \nSary  Tash  to  the  Kyrgyz-Tajik  border  and  121  km  from  the \nKyrgyz-Tajik border to Nimich); (ii) improved infrastructure at the \nKyrgyz-PRC  border  crossing  (Irkeshtam)  and  the  Kyrgyz-Tajik \nborder  crossing  (Karamik);  (iii)  increased  sustainability  and \ncapacity of the road subsector through outsourcing maintenance \noperations  to  the  private  sector  in  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  and \nTajikistan; and (iv) a cross-border agreement among the Kyrgyz \nRepublic, PRC, and Tajikistan. \n   ", "ii   \nRationale  The project corridor is the most direct link from the PRC to Central \nand South Asia. It falls under Corridor 3 of the six priority corridors \nidentified under the Transport Sector Strategy of the Central Asia \nRegional Economic Cooperation Program. The road sections to \nbe rehabilitated under the Project are in poor condition and restrict \ndomestic and international traffic. This obstructs trade between \nthe  Kyrgyz  Republic,  Tajikistan,  and  the  Xinjiang  Uygur \nAutonomous Region of the PRC and other neighboring Central \nAsian countries. By improving the remaining road sections of the \ncorridor from Dushanbe to the Kyrgyz-PRC border at Irkeshtam, \nthe  Project  will  open  up  this  potentially  promising  corridor  for \nregional trade and cooperation.  \n \nIn addition, border infrastructure at Karamik and Irkeshtam are \ninadequate  to  handle  cross-border  traffic.  With  improved  road \nconditions, cross-border traffic is expected to rise. The Project will \nimprove border infrastructure with better traffic handling facilities. \nIt will also develop a cross-border agreement among the Kyrgyz \nRepublic, PRC, and Tajikistan to streamline and simplify border \nand customs procedures for smooth movement across borders.  \n   \nImpact and Outcome  The  Project  will  contribute  to  reducing  transport  costs  and \nfostering regional trade and cooperation among Kyrgyz Republic, \nPRC, Tajikistan, and other Central Asian countries. The project \noutcome  is  increased  regional  traffic  and  trade,  along  with \nimproved  access  to  regional  markets  and  social  services  for \npeople living along the Corridor. \n   \nProject Investment Plan  ($ million) \nItem  TAJ  KGZ  Total \nCivil Works  45.1  20.6  65.7 \nLand Acquisition and Resettlement  0.1  0.0  0.1 \nPerformance-Based Maintenance  4.0  4.0  8.0 \nConsulting Services  3.0  2.6  5.6 \nTaxes and Duties  12.9  6.6  19.5 \nContingencies  11.0  5.7  16.7 \nInterest During Construction  0.4  0.0  0.4 \nTotal  76.5  39.5  116.0 \n  KGZ = Kyrgyz Republic, TAJ = Tajikistan. \n  Source: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n   ", "  iii\nFinancing Plan  ($ million) \nSource  TAJ  KGZ  Total \nADB Loan  40.9  0.0  40.9 \nADB Grant  12.5  25.6  38.1 \nGovernment of Kyrgyz Republic  0.0  13.9  13.9 \nGovernment of Tajikistan  23.1  0.0  23.1 \nTotal  76.5  39.5  116.0 \n ADB = Asian Development Bank, KGZ = Kyrgyz Republic,  \nTAJ = Tajikistan. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n   \n  Kyrgyz  Republic  Component.  ADB  will  provide  a  grant  not \nexceeding $25.6 million from its Special Funds resources to help \nfinance  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  component  of  the  Project.  The \nproposed  grant  will  finance  65%  of  the  Kyrgyz  Republic \ncomponent  of  the  project  cost.  The  Government  will  provide \ncounterpart financing of $13.9 million to cover (i) taxes related to \nthe civil works, (ii) border infrastructure improvement works, and \n(iii) performance-based maintenance contracts. \n \nTajikistan  Component.  ADB  will  provide  a  loan  in  Special \nDrawing  Rights  equivalent  to  $40.9  million  and  a  grant  not \nexceeding $12.5 million from its Special Funds resources to help \nfinance the Tajikistan component of the Project. The proposed \nloan and grant will finance 70% of the project cost under the \nTajikistan component. The Government of Tajikistan will provide \ncounterpart financing of $23.1 million to cover (i) taxes related to \nthe civil works, (ii) border infrastructure improvement works, and \n(iii) performance-based maintenance contracts.  \n \nThe proposed ADB loan will have a term of 32 years, including a \ngrace  period  of  8  years,  with  an  interest  charge  of  1.0%  per \nannum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter. \n   \nPeriods of Utilization  Kyrgyz Republic Component: Until 30 September 2013  \nTajikistan Component: Until 30 September 2013 \n   \nEstimated Project  Kyrgyz Republic Component: 31 March 2013  \nCompletion Dates  Tajikistan Component: 31 March 2013 \n   \nExecuting Agencies  Kyrgyz  Republic  Component.

The PIU directors under the Tajik and \nKyrgyz  ministries  of  transport  and  communications  will  be \nsupported by additional staff. Roads departments under each of \nthe  EAs  will  implement  performance-based  maintenance \ncomponents with support from the PIUs.  \n \nBorder  infrastructure  improvement  components  will  be \nimplemented by the existing PIUs operating under the EAs\u2019 ongoing \nADB-financed Regional Customs Modernization and Infrastructure \nDevelopment Project (footnote 9 of main document).  \n   \nProcurement  Contracts estimated at $1.0 million and more for civil works will be \nprocured  through  international  competitive  bidding  procedures \n(ICB) and contracts estimated from $100,000 to less than $1.0 \nmillion  will  be  procured  following  national  competitive  bidding \n(NCB) procedures as described in the procurement plans for the \nProject (Appendix 7). Civil works for the road improvement works \nhave been packaged into six contracts (three in each country) to \nbe  procured  following  ICB  procedures.  Contractors  will  be \nrequired to produce detailed design and working drawings under \neach  contract,  and  EAs  will  provide  detailed  survey  and \ninvestigation  details,  including  details  of  topographic  surveys, \ncarried out at the project preparatory technical assistance (PPTA) \nstage. A border infrastructure improvement component has been \npackaged into one civil works contract in each country, and the \nperformance-based  maintenance  (PBM)  road  maintenance \ncomponent has been packaged into 10 contracts (five in each \ncountry).  Civil  works  for  border  infrastructure  and  PBM \ncomponents will be procured following national procurement laws \nof  the  respective  governments.  The  procurement  plan  will  be \nreviewed regularly, amended as necessary, and will cover at least \nthe next 18 months of the procurement activities during the project \nimplementation. All procurement to be financed by ADB under the \nProject will be carried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement \nGuidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). \n   ", "  v\nConsulting Services  The Project will require a total of 683 person-months of consulting \nservices for the Tajikistan component and 430 person-months for \nthe Kyrgyz Republic component. Services of consulting firms will \nbe provided to support the EAs in (i) construction supervision, \nincluding training for the private sector and tendering out PBM \ncontracts; (ii) project benefits monitoring and evaluation; and (iii) \nproject  management.  International  consulting  services  for  65 \nperson-months will be provided for the Tajikistan component of \nthe  Project,  and  59  person-months  for  the  Kyrgyz  Republic \ncomponent. The international consulting services will be assisted \nby  568  person-months  of  national  consulting  services  for  the \nTajikistan  component  and  321  person-months  for  the  Kyrgyz \nRepublic component. Fifty (twenty-five in each country) person-\nmonths of individual international consulting services and 50 (25 \nin each country) of individual national consulting services will be \nprovided for the Tajikistan and Kyrgyz Republic components to \nsupport  TAJMOTC  and  KGZMOTC  in  privatization  and \noutsourcing road maintenance activities to the private sector. All \nconsultants to be financed under the Project will be recruited in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants \n(2007, as amended from time to time). \n   \nProject Benefits and  The Project will substantially reduce the obstruction to trade and \nBeneficiaries  facilitate regional trade and cooperation. The entire region will \nbenefit from the Project, while the immediate project area will gain \nthrough economic development and increased access to markets \nand  social  services.  Improvement  of  the  road  will  facilitate \nagricultural  production,  mining  industry  development,  and \nemployment opportunities. The economic internal rate of return \n(EIRR) for the overall Project is 18.1%, and the net present value \nis $37.6 million. Considering benefits accruing separately, EIRR \nfor  the  Tajikistan  component  is  17.9%,  and  for  the  Kyrgyz \nRepublic  component  is  14.5%.  Most  of  the  benefits  accrue  to \ninternational traffic (54%), followed by savings in road user costs \n(27%),  agricultural  production  (17%),  and  time  and  domestic \ngenerated traffic benefits (2%). Tajikistan would receive 70% of \nproject net benefits, the Kyrgyz Republic 20.5%, the PRC 9.3%, \nand  Afghanistan  0.2%.  Due  to  the  Project,  trade  between  the \nKyrgyz Republic and Tajikistan is expected to grow from 27,236 \ntons in 2006 to 250,000 tons in 2015, Tajikistan-PRC trade from \n14,260  tons  in  2006  to  1  million  tons  in  2015,  and  PRC-\nAfghanistan trade from 0 to 500,000 tons in the same period.   \n \nWhile the Project does not directly target poverty reduction, it has \nindirect  benefits  for  the  poor  through  increased  mobility  and \naccessibility to markets and social services in the project area; \nlower transport costs for inputs and products; better access to and \ninteraction  with  other  regions;  and  employment  opportunities \nduring construction and after completion owing to increased coal \nmining, urbanization, and other economic activities. Indirectly, the \nProject  will  benefit  (i)  about  228,000  people  from  three \n ", "vi   \ncommunities in Tajikistan, of whom 100,800, or 44%, are poor; \nand (ii) about 29,000 people from two communities in the Kyrgyz \nRepublic, of whom 52% are poor. Another quarter of beneficiaries \nare considered just above the poverty line.  \n   \nRisks and Assumptions  Key  assumptions  are  (i)  continued  political  stability,  strong \neconomic performance, and commitment to regional cooperation \namong the Kyrgyz Republic, PRC, and Tajikistan; (ii) continued \nexternal assistance and governments\u2019 commitment to develop the \nroad subsector in the Kyrgyz Republic and Tajikistan; and (iii) \ntimely  provision  of  counterpart  funding  and  support  from  local \ngovernments and communities. The main project risks include: (i) \nforecast  international  traffic  does  not  materialize,  and  (ii)  cost \noverruns  may  occur  due  to  sharp  escalation  in  prices  for \nconstruction  materials  and  labor.  Given  the  current  economic \ndevelopment perspectives in the region and trends in the region\u2019s \ntrade and transport turnover, it is anticipated that forecasted traffic \nwould, indeed, materialize. It is expected that the economies of \nthe regional countries would grow at least at the same pace as \nthey do currently and most likely even faster. Reasonable price \nescalation factors were incorporated into the cost estimates to \nminimize the risk of project cost overruns. Based on the current \ntrend in world prices for major construction inputs, the escalation \nof  the  project  costs  beyond  the  reasonable  assumptions \nincorporated into the project costs is unlikely. Based on these \nassumptions and the likelihood of risks, it is expected that the \nProject\u2019s benefits will outweigh its costs. \n   \nTechnical Assistance  The Project will be accompanied by regional technical assistance \n(TA) to help prepare the cross-border agreement (CBA) among \nthe Kyrgyz Republic, PRC, and Tajikistan. The CBA will facilitate \nsmooth  transborder  movement  of  people  and  goods  and  will \nremove nonphysical barriers to regional trade and transport. The \noutcome of the TA is a CBA signed by the governments of the \nKyrgyz Republic, PRC, and Tajikistan prior to completion of the \nphysical works under the Project. The TA will be implemented \nover  24  months  and  finance  the  services  of  international \nconsultants for 24 person-months and national consultants for 10 \nperson-months. The total cost of the TA is estimated at $550,000. \nThe TA will be financed on a grant basis from ADB\u2019s TA funding \nprogram in the amount of $500,000. ADB will be the EA for the \nTA, and the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic will provide an in-\nkind contribution estimated at $50,000 through providing office \nspace for the consultants, administrative support, and counterpart \nstaff.  \n ", " ", "", " ", "", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \ngrant to the Kyrgyz Republic, and (ii) a proposed loan and grant to the Republic of Tajikistan for \nthe CAREC Regional Road Corridor Improvement Project. The report also describes proposed \ntechnical assistance (TA) for the development of a cross-border agreement among the Kyrgyz \nRepublic, People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), and Tajikistan, and, if the Board approves the \nproposed loan and grants, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, will \napprove the TA. \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n2.  The  PRC\u2013Kyrgyz  Republic\u2013Tajikistan  road  corridor  (the  Corridor),  which  runs  from \nIrkeshtam on the Kyrgyz Republic border with the PRC to Dushanbe and is approximately 550 \nkilometers (km) in length, is a key transport artery for the two landlocked countries, the Kyrgyz \nRepublic and Tajikistan, to trade with the PRC. It is also an integral part of the regional road \nnetwork in Central Asia linking the Kyrgyz Republic, PRC, Tajikistan, Afghanistan, Uzbekistan, \nand Turkmenistan. More broadly, it is a part of the Asian highway network connecting, through \nAfghanistan, the ocean ports of Iran and Pakistan to Kazakhstan and the Russian Federation.   \n \n3.  The Corridor is the most direct link from the PRC to Central and South Asia (para. 10). It \nfalls under Corridor 3 of the six priority corridors identified under the Transport Sector Strategy \nof the Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation (CAREC) program. Poor road conditions \nwithin this Corridor are bottlenecks to domestic and international traffic. In particular, they \nobstruct trade between the Kyrgyz Republic, Tajikistan, and the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous \nRegion (Xinjiang) of the PRC and other neighboring Central Asian countries. By improving the \nremaining sections of the corridor from Dushanbe to the Kyrgyz-PRC border at Irkeshtam, the \nProject will remove the obstruction and open up this potentially promising corridor for regional \ntrade and cooperation. Separate feasibility studies were prepared through Asian Development \nBank (ADB) project preparatory technical assistance (PPTA)1 for each country. The design and \nmonitoring framework for the proposed project is in Appendix 1. \n \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n1.  Trade and Transport in Central Asia \n4.  The existing transport infrastructure in Central Asia was developed to serve the needs of \nthe centrally planned economy of the former Soviet Union (FSU) and thus was oriented more \ntowards the Russian Federation and Europe. This has created difficulties since independence, \nas these countries found themselves with fragmented transport networks that frequently cross \nand recross the borders of neighboring countries. Also, the transport corridors had not been \ndeveloped in the past to link Central Asia with the PRC, thus restricting the trading potential in \nthe region. For similar reasons, and reflecting the frequently mountainous conditions, passage \nbetween Central Asia and South Asia had been even more restricted.  \n \n5.  The region\u2019s transportation industry suffered economic decline in the past decade, the \nmajor problem being a disruption of the economic ties among the newly independent Central \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2007.

Regional Technical Assistance for Maintenance of \nRegional Road Transport Corridors Project. Manila (TA 6309-REG, approved on 9 March).  ", "2 \nAsian Republics (CARs). This resulted in a sharp reduction in transport turnover followed by \nrapid deterioration of the infrastructure assets due to severe shortage of funds for maintenance \nand  improvement.  The  breakup  of  the  FSU\u2019s  centrally  planned  system  has  also  created \ninstitutional problems resulting in poor management and planning, inadequate staffing and high \nstaff turnover, and inadequate legal and regulatory systems.  \n \n6.  Trade volumes in the CARs have more than doubled in recent years, rising from $17.7 \nmillion in 1999 to $44.5 million in 2005.2 By 2004, the overall level of trade (as measured by the \nratio of merchandise exports plus imports to gross domestic product) in all the CARs was higher \nthan  what  one  might  expect  given  their  size,  location,  and  per  capita  GDP.3 Total  freight \nturnover has grown across the CARs from 145 billion ton-kilometers (ton-km) in 1999 to about \n250 billion ton-km in 2005. Central Asia\u2019s generally poor road network conditions limit road \ntransport, which is reflected in about 80% of the region\u2019s transport volume being carried by rail.   \n \n2.  PRC as an Emerging Trading Partner \n7.  The PRC has emerged as a major trading partner for the CARs, but so far only as an \nexporter. All countries in the region significantly increased their trade with the PRC during 2001\u2013\n2005. The PRC\u2019s overall share of imports into Central Asia4 rose from 2.7% in 2001 to 18.0% in \n2005, and that trend is likely to continue. The gain owes to the fast growing western regions of \nthe  PRC,  and  in  particular  the  Xinjiang  Uygur  Autonomous  Region  (Xinjiang),  along  with \nongoing improvement of the regional corridors. Most of the traded goods are carried by rail, \nwhich is inexpensive but circuitous and slow. International road transport is constrained by poor \nquality of roads and winding mountain passes, which limit both the size of vehicles and length of \ntime that the roads and border posts are at all passable during the winter months. \n \n8.  The most dramatic increase in trade with the PRC has been exhibited by the Kyrgyz \nRepublic and Tajikistan. Table 1 below shows that trade with the PRC in 2005 accounted for \n$1.05  billion  (35.4%)  in  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  and  $158  million  (6.7%)  in  Tajikistan.  This \nrepresented 15-fold and 20-fold growth, respectively, compared to 2001. But in both countries \nthe rise has been disproportionately on the import side, with export-import ratios of 10:1 for the \nKyrgyz Republic and 16:1 for Tajikistan in 2005. Merchandise imports from the PRC as a \npercentage of GDP in 2005 came to 44.2% and 11.3%, respectively. While road transport \ncarried 21,930 tons of the Kyrgyz Republic\u2019s imports from the PRC in 2005, only 12,200 tons of \nTajikistan\u2019s imports from the PRC in the same year were carried by road, and these were mainly \nvehicles  imported  under  their  own  power.  It  is  expected  that  once  the  road  corridor  and \nassociated border infrastructure and procedures are improved, the road share of imports from \nthe PRC will grow significantly and the proportion of exports will pick up gradually, especially as \npotential mining concessions becoming operational in the project area, both in the Kyrgyz \nRepublic and Tajikistan.5 \n \n \n                                                 \n2  ADB. 2006.

The feasibility study of the ADB-financed Dushanbe\u2013Kyrgyz Border Road Rehabilitation \nProject (Phase II)6 suggests that there will be substantial transit traffic due to trade between the \nPRC and Afghanistan once the full length of the Corridor will be rehabilitated and the security \nsituation  in  Afghanistan  improves.  Particularly  in  the  absence  of  a  rail  connection  into \nAfghanistan, the road route through the Kyrgyz Republic and Tajikistan is the only transport link \nbetween the Kashi railhead in Xinjiang and Kabul in Afghanistan. \n \n3.  The Corridor as Part of the Regional Road Network \n10.  The Corridor is an integral part of the regional road network in Central Asia and is the \nonly bottleneck that, if removed, will reduce travel distances and time along two major regional \nroad corridors extending from Russia, Kazakhstan, and the PRC in the north to Afghanistan, \nPakistan,  and  Iran  in  the  south  across  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  and  Tajikistan  (see  Regional \nTransport Corridors Map). First corridor originates at Kashi in the PRC, leads to Dushanbe in \nTajikistan, continues on to Kabul in Afghanistan, and finally reaches ocean ports in Pakistan and \nIran. Distance from Kashi to Kabul along this corridor is about 1,395 km and passes through \nless  difficult  terrain conditions  as compared  to  the  1,810-km  Karakorum  Highway  corridor. \nSecond corridor is 1,098 km long and originates at Almaty in Kazakhstan, then passes through \nBishkek and Osh in the Kyrgyz Republic until it reaches Sary Tash, where it joins the first \ncorridor. Almost the entire length of both corridors, except the project road sections, are being \nimproved or funds have been secured for rehabilitation. Once all planned improvements are \ncompleted, the travel time along these corridors will shorten from about 5 days to 3 days. In \n                                                 \n6  ADB. 2005.

In addition, \nthe project road is part of a major international corridor that will potentially link the PRC with the \nPersian  Gulf.7 Clearly,  completing  the  remaining  links  of  this  regional  corridor  offers  new \nopportunities to intensify regional cooperation. The Kyrgyz Republic and Tajikistan will greatly \nbenefit from the Project by becoming conduits of regional trade.  \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n1.  Problems and Constraints in the Transport Sector \n11.  Transport sectors of both the Kyrgyz Republic and Tajikistan have similar constraints \nand challenges. Both countries are situated in mountainous and landlocked landscapes, suffer \nfrom frequent climatic calamities, operate inefficiently with little maintenance, and face severe \nshortage in capital investments. At the same time, they are confronted with growing demand for \nregional access and trade. Both countries are strategically located to serve the transit needs of \ntheir fast growing neighbors, such as Kazakhstan and the PRC. Key challenges that these \ncountries must overcome to fully realize their aspirations as conduits of regional trade are (i) \nremoving  barriers  to  regional  trade  and  cooperation,  (ii)  building  efficient  and  integrated \ntransport systems, and (iii) catching up on the accumulated shortfall in sector financing and \ninvestment.  As  both  countries\u2019  transport  sectors  are  dominated  by  road  transport,  these \nchallenges are all directly linked to the road subsector. Subsector analyses for each country are \npresented in Appendix 2. \n  \na.  Removing Barriers to Regional Trade and Cooperation  \n12.  The Central Asian countries need to trade not only among themselves but also to reach \nbeyond traditional FSU markets. Recognizing this urgent need, these countries have embarked \nupon developing their transport links with their nontraditional trading partners in the region. They \nhave made strong commitments toward achieving this objective at various venues promoting \nregional cooperation. The Kyrgyz Republic, PRC and Tajikistan, as active members of the ADB-\nsponsored  CAREC  program,  confirmed  their  commitments  to  \u201cworking  together  for  trade \nopenness, transport corridors for integrating the region and connecting to external markets, and \nfor  developing  and  sharing  the  region\u2019s  energy  resources\u201d  during  the  Fourth  Ministerial \nConference in Bishkek in 2005. The CAREC Transport Sector Strategy Statement8 called for \nproviding safe, dependable, effective, efficient, and fully integrated transport operations and \ninfrastructure  with  three  overarching  goals:  (i)  establishing  competitive  transport  corridors \nacross  the  CAREC  region;  (ii)  facilitating  efficient  movement  of  people  and  goods  across \nborders, and (iii) developing safe, people-friendly transport systems. Cross-border transport \nprocedures are being addressed under the ADB-financed Regional Customs Modernization and \nInfrastructure Development Project,9 and developing a harmonized regulatory framework is one \nissue  addressed  as  part  of  the  Transport  Sector  Coordination  Committee  work  under  the \nCAREC program. With loans from ADB and other donors, major corridor improvements are \nunderway  accompanied  by  ongoing  policy  dialogue  to  introduce  reforms  for  better  sector \nfunding and management. \n \n                                                 \n7  Planned improvement of the Dushanbe\u2013Tursunzade Road (Uzbek border), which is included as a firm project for \n2009 in ADB\u2019s Country Operations and Business Plan, 2007\u20132009 for Tajikistan, will open a land access to Iran \nand Turkey through Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan.   \n8  CAREC. 8-9 September 2007.

In addition, the Kyrgyz Republic and Tajikistan are active participants in other regional \ninitiatives, such as the Road Transport Facilitation Agreement under the Shanghai Cooperation \nOrganization which is currently being negotiated, the Transit Transport Framework Agreement \nunder  the  Economic  Cooperation  Organization,  the  European  Union\u2019s  Transport  Corridor \nEurope-Caucasus-Asia program, and the UN-ESCAP program. All of these promote regional \ncooperation and specifically deal with trade and transport issues in the Central Asian countries. \nBesides the PRC\u2019s emerging as a major trading partner in the region fueled with Kazakhstan\u2019s \noil-rich economy, there is vast potential for the Kyrgyz Republic and Tajikistan to play key roles \nin bringing the external markets closer to Central Asia. \n \nb.  Efficient and Integrated Transport Systems \n14.  An efficient and integrated transport system is the objective of both the Kyrgyz Republic \nand Tajikistan, which is reflected in their respective transport sector policy papers. This is also \nthe objective of the CAREC regional transport sector strategy10 that is under development with \nADB support. Issues that limit transport efficiency in the Kyrgyz Republic and Tajikistan are \nsimilar  and  include  (i)  weak  strategies  and  regulations;  (ii)  poor  condition  of  roads  and \ninadequate maintenance; (iii) inadequate planning, management, and operating tools; and (iv) \nlimited institutional capacity and human resource constraints.  \n \n15.  Weak  Strategies  and  Regulations.  ADB  has  been  intensively  involved  in  policy \ndialogue with both the Kyrgyz Republic and Tajikistan. In Tajikistan, as a result of ADB\u2019s \nadvisory TA,11 the transport sector policy was formulated and administration of the transport \nsector was reorganized with creation of the Ministry of Transport in 2001. Similarly, ADB was \ninstrumental in the Kyrgyz Republic in introducing market-based reforms in the transport sector \nand  developing  transport  and  road  sector  policy  statements.12 Nonetheless,  strategies  to \nsupport policies remain weak and regulations are inconsistent. Strategies focus narrowly on \nambitious outputs with little linkage to the available resources, both financial and human. ADB is \nassisting the Kyrgyz Republic and Tajikistan to formulate adequate strategies and programs to \nachieve sector policy objectives. ADB recently approved TA for Tajikistan for developing a \ntransport  sector  master  plan13 to  formulate  strategic  priorities  in  the  sector.  In  the  Kyrgyz \nRepublic,  the  Government  is  considering  a  road  subsector  strategy14 prepared  with  the \nassistance of ADB-financed TA.15 \n \n16.  Inadequate  Planning  and  Management.  Although  the  economies  of  the  countries \nmade a transition to an open market, the planning and management tools remained unchanged \nand continued to function under the command methods. Priorities were driven so far by the \nimperative  to  link  different  parts  of  the  country  or  provide  regional  access.  Virtually  no \nprioritization  and  planning  methodologies  exist  either  under  Tajik  or  Kyrgyz  ministries  of \ntransport and communications. There is a need to introduce new market-oriented planning tools \nalong  with  modern  management  and  operating  practices.  ADB  is  assisting  the  MOTCs  in \n                                                 \n10 ADB. 2006.

Limited Institutional Capacity. Institutional capacity and human resource constraints \nlimit the introduction of best practices in the transport sector, including planning, management, \noperation, and maintenance. The sector financial management capacity is weak. International \naccounting and auditing procedures have yet to be followed. The sector is losing experienced \nmanagerial and technical resources because of low salaries and lack of incentives. A sound \ninstitutional and human resources development plan is essential to sustainable development in \nthe transport sector. The transport sector master plan (footnote 13) for Tajikistan will assess the \ncurrent situation and include a viable plan for institutional capacity development through both \nchanges in the institutional environment and targeted training. In the Kyrgyz Republic, this will \nbe addressed by the newly proposed strategy (footnote 14) \n \nc.  Accumulated Sector Financing Shortfall \n18.  Both  in  the  Kyrgyz  Republic and Tajikistan,  various  studies  and  governments\u2019  own \nassessments indicate that about 80% of the road network is rated as in \u201cpoor\u201d condition. That is \na major constraint on the countries\u2019 economic and social development. The Kyrgyz Republic \nreported in its draft road sector strategy paper (footnote 14) an alarming loss of about 1,000 km \nof asphalt-surfaced roads over 5 years. In Tajikistan, aggravated by civil war that erupted in the \n1990s, a recent study17 financed by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development \nestimated a loss of road infrastructure assets worth about $1.2 billion since 1990. The severe \nfiscal constraints limited budget allocations for improving and maintaining roads at only 20% of \nthe required funding level. The governments rely heavily on external funding, which amounted \nto $260 million in the Kyrgyz Republic and $500 million in Tajikistan over the last 10 years. In \nthe same strategy paper, the Kyrgyz Republic reported needing over $1 billion to rehabilitate its \n2,242 km of major road corridors and annual maintenance funding of $48 million over the next 5 \nyears to bring its devastated road network back into a maintainable condition. The annual \nfunding level required to keep Tajikistan\u2019s 3,135 km of major roads maintained is estimated at \n$32  million  (TA  4294-TAJ,  footnote  16),  with  a  further  $1  billion  for  rehabilitation.  It  is  a \nparamount challenge for the two governments to catch up after this underspending and secure \nfunding  needed  to  achieve  their  objectives.  They  recognize  the  urgency  of  reforms  and \nchanges. The way forward is to raise sufficient revenues by introducing revenue generating \nmechanisms and involve the private sector to efficiently utilize available funding. It is also \nimportant for the governments to effectively plan and prioritize capital investments and increase \ncapacity to efficiently implement them. The proposed Project will contribute to reducing the \nshortfall in capital investment in the two countries and complete the remaining part of this key \ncorridor.    \n   \n2.  Government and ADB Strategies \n19.  The Project will be the fourth ADB-financed project in the road subsector for Tajikistan \nand the fifth for the Kyrgyz Republic.

The Project directly supports two of the four strategic objectives  \nidentified  in  the  Regional  Cooperation  Strategy  and  Programs:18 (i)  increasing  trade  and \nintegration  with  large  markets  in  South  Asia,  the  PRC,  Iran,  Turkey,  and  the  Russian \nFederation; and (ii) improving economic cooperation to reduce transport costs and facilitate \ntrade and transit, allowing Central Asian countries to become integrated and use their location \nto their advantage. Transport sector development is also a priority focus in ADB\u2019s country \nstrategies for both countries. \n \n20.  Policy directives of both governments require development of the respective transport \nsectors to be based on market-oriented reforms and restructuring to improve efficiency. The \ngovernments\u2019 strategies include developing international road corridors to facilitate external \ntrade and transit traffic, as well as to establish legal and regulatory frameworks to encourage \nprivate sector participation in transport. The Project is consistent with the transport sector \nstrategies of both governments and is included in their respective public investment programs.  \n \n3.  External Assistance \n21.  ADB\u2019s loans in the road subsector totaled $64.5 million to Tajikistan and $145 million to \nthe Kyrgyz Republic, all of which are for rehabilitation of road corridors from Bishkek (capital of \nthe Kyrgyz Republic) to Dushanbe (capital of Tajikistan). ADB is a leading lender to both \ncountries. Other major lenders include the World Bank, Islamic Development Bank, Kuwait \nFund,  Saudi  Fund,  Republic  of  Iran,  and  the  PRC.  Appendix  3  summarizes  the  external \nassistance to the road subsector.  \n \n4.  Lessons Learned \n22.  ADB has been engaged in the countries\u2019 transport sectors for more than 10 years by \nfinancing a number of road rehabilitation projects and TAs. Based on the previous projects, the \nfollowing major lessons can be drawn: (i) inexperience of the project implementation units \n(PIUs)  on procurement-related  issues  and nonavailability  of  advance  action  at  the  time  of \nproject preparation that led to implementation delays; (ii) creating separate PIUs for individual \nprojects  that  led  to  ineffective  work  balance  among  PIUs  and  discontinuity  in  business \nprocesses; (iii) ineffective assurances for securing adequate funding for road maintenance; and \n(iv) delays due to loan effectiveness assurances, such as signing a cross-border agreement \n(CBA), as was the case with the Almaty-Bishkek Regional Road Rehabilitation Project.19 In \naddition, lessons from ADB infrastructure projects in Greater Mekong Subregion countries have \nbeen taken into account in the project design. The project design incorporates these lessons as \nfollows:  \n(i)  The PIUs have now gained considerable experience and are increasingly familiar \nwith ADB policies and procedures. It was agreed with the governments that the \nProject  will  be  implemented  by  the  same  PIUs  and  thus,  the  continuity  in \nbusiness processes and, most importantly, PIUs\u2019 personnel will be ensured.  \n(ii)  In  general,  funding  for  road  maintenance  has  improved.  In  line  with  loan \ncovenants  attached  to  ADB-financed  projects,  governments  have  increased \nallocations for road maintenance at an agreed rate annually. The Project will \ncontinue to encourage the increase in road maintenance financing. \n                                                 \n18 ADB. 2004.

THE PROPOSED PROJECT \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n23.  The Project will contribute to reducing transport costs and fostering regional trade and \ncooperation among the Kyrgyz Republic, PRC, Tajikistan, and other Central Asian countries. \nThe outcome is improved access to regional markets and social services for people living along \nthe road corridor.  \n \n24.  The region served by the road network encompassing the project road stretches from \nKazakhstan to Afghanistan, with links to the Russian Federation to the north, the PRC to the \neast, and Pakistan and Iran to the south (para. 10). The immediate project area encompassing \nthe road sections to be improved is in the Rash Valley northeast of Dushanbe in Tajikistan and \nthe Alay Valley southwest of Osh in the Kyrgyz Republic.  \n \nB.  Outputs \n25.  The Project outputs comprise (i) 263 km of improved two-lane road from Sary Tash in \nthe Kyrgyz Republic to Nimich in Tajikistan (about 142 km from Sary Tash to the Kyrgyz-Tajik \nborder  at  Karamik  and  about  121  km  from  Karamik  border  to  Nimich);  (ii)  improved \ninfrastructure and facilities at the Kyrgyz-PRC border crossing (Irkeshtam) and the Kyrgyz-Tajik \nborder crossing (Karamik); (iii) increased sustainability and capacity of the road subsectors \nthrough outsourcing maintenance operations to the private sector in the Kyrgyz Republic and \nTajikistan; and (iv) a cross-border agreement among the Kyrgyz Republic, PRC, and Tajikistan. \n \n26.  Component A: Road Improvement. Sections of the road corridor to be improved under \nthe Project are located between Nimich, some 217 km northeast of Dushanbe in Tajikistan, and \nSary Tash, approximately 120 km southeast of Osh in the Kyrgyz Republic. The road section \nfrom Nimich to the Kyrgyz-Tajik border is 121 km long (km 217-338). It continues from the end \nof the section that is being rehabilitated under ADB-financed Phase II of the rehabilitation of the \nDushanbe\u2013Kyrgyz border road (footnote 6) until it reaches the border checkpoint, about 12 km \nbefore the physical borderline that is also being improved under Phase II. The road section in \nthe Kyrgyz Republic is 142 km long (km 350-492) and continues from the Kyrgyz-Tajik border \nuntil it reaches Sary Tash, at the end of the ongoing ADB-financed Southern Transport Corridor \nproject.20 This two-lane road passes along riverbanks almost throughout its entire length, except \nfor  the  mountain  pass  at  the  Kyrgyz-Tajik  border,  and  suffers  from  unstable  geological \nconditions and erosion of riverbanks from frequent floods. Originally almost entirely sealed with \nbituminous pavement, the road has deteriorated to the extent that some sections have lost the \nbituminous surfacing and at some locations the road is barely a track. The civil works for \nimprovement of road sections on km 217-338 will include reconstruction of asphalt concrete \npavement,  reinforcement  of  embankment,  slope  rehabilitation  and  protection  measures, \ninstallation of drainage systems, construction of new and rehabilitation of existing bridges, and \nroad safety measures. Civil works for road sections on km 350-492 will vary  and include \n                                                 \n20 ADB. 2004.

The Project will also replace 9 \nseriously deteriorated bridges, repair 12 bridges, and build 4 new bridges. All the civil works \nhave  been  designed  to  comply  with  respective  national  highway  design  and  construction \nstandards as well as widely used international standards.21  \n \n27.  Component  B:  Road  Maintenance  Improvement.  The  Project  will  improve \nsustainability  of  the  road  subsector  by  introducing  and/or  enhancing  outsourcing  of  road \nmaintenance activities to the private sector. The governments are making efforts to tender out \nroad maintenance activities to the private sector, but the private sector\u2019s capacity is low and the \nenabling environment for its engagement is lacking. The scope and funding for such works are \nnot conducive to private sector participation. For the private sector to successfully engage in this \nopportunity, there should be (i) a capacity building program, both within the private sector and \nthe road agency; and (ii) attractive incentives (i.e., scope and funding should encourage the \nprivate sector to invest in new equipment and acquire adequate skills). The Project\u2019s capacity \nbuilding component will have two intervention levels. The first intervention will be through the \nconstruction supervision consultant\u2019s contract for road improvement works, which will include a \ntraining program for the private sector contractors in (i) best international contracting practices,22 \n(ii) preparing bids for performance and/or output-based road maintenance contracts, and (iii) \ncontract management and execution. The second intervention will be at the Executing Agency \n(EA)  level.  This  will  require  recruiting  a  management  consultant  to  assist  the  EA  in  (i) \nintroducing institutional reforms; (ii) developing a program for road maintenance privatization \nand outsourcing; and (iii) design, preparation, and administration of performance and/or output-\nbased contracts. The management consultant will work closely with the EA and be responsible \nfor all activities leading to privatizing and outsourcing road maintenance activities. These two \ninterventions  will  support  each  other  and  be  coordinated  closely.  To  facilitate  an  enabling \nenvironment and greater interest from private sector contractors, the Project will introduce \nperformance-based maintenance (PBM) on a pilot basis (para. 32).  \n \n28.  Component C: Border Infrastructure Development. The border infrastructure and \nfacilities at the Karamik border post are inadequate and poorly equipped to handle cross-border \ntraffic. Due to poor road conditions, the traffic is minimal and therefore the Karamik border post \nhas received inadequate funding and least priority from the Government of Tajikistan. There is \nonly a simple structure with basic amenities to house a few customs and border officials. In fact, \nfew border posts in Tajikistan have permanent structures designed for customs operations, nor \ndo they have the equipment necessary for detailed inspection of cargo or communications \nequipment to support operations. Selected border posts in Tajikistan will be improved under the \nADB-financed Regional Customs Modernization and Infrastructure Development project (Loan \n2114-TAJ)  (footnote  9).  This  will  involve  (i)  developing  the  Unified  Automated  Information \nSystem,  and  (ii)  improving  border  post  infrastructure.  The  Project  will  improve  border \ninfrastructure at the Karamik border post, and customs equipment and automated systems will \nbe provided under Loan 2114-TAJ in order for it to be compatible with a centralized system. In \ncontrast, cross-border traffic at the Kyrgyz-PRC border is considerably higher, and therefore it \nhas  received  better  funding  from  the  Government  of  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  through  donor \nassistance. Due to the growing cross-border traffic and demand for speedy border crossing, \nhowever, there is a need to further improve border infrastructure for handling cross-border \n                                                 \n21 Such  as  British  Standards  (BS)  and  standards  developed  by  American  Association  of  State  Highway  and \nTransportation Officials (AASHTO).  \n22 Such as FIDIC contracts of International Federation of Consulting Engineers. http://www.fidic.org/. \n ", "10 \ntraffic.

To facilitate regional economic cooperation, the governments recognize the need for \nremoving physical and nonphysical cross-border barriers. For this purpose, the CBA is needed \nto regulate and ease the movement of people and goods across borders. It would cover (i) \nfacilitating border crossing formalities, (ii) cross-border movement of people and goods, (iii) \nrequirements  for  admitting  road  vehicles,  (iv)  exchange  of  commercial  traffic  rights,  (v) \ninfrastructure, (vi) institutional issues, and (vii) miscellaneous provisions. This will be facilitated \nby proposed regional TA (para. 53).  \n \n2.  Outsourcing Road Maintenance  \n30.  Road maintenance, both in the Kyrgyz Republic and Tajikistan, has traditionally been \ncarried  out by  maintenance  units under  the government\u2019s  line  ministry  responsible  for  the \ntransport sector, using force-account procedures. Facing severe fiscal constraints and realizing \nthe inefficiency of the existing system, the governments seek to improve road maintenance and \nits financing. In particular, they recognize that transferring road maintenance operations to the \ncompetitive private sector would lead to efficient utilization of scarce resources.  \n \n31.  ADB supported strengthening road maintenance and financing through policy dialogue \nand advisory technical assistance, both in the Kyrgyz Republic and Tajikistan. Ongoing ADB-\nfinanced  projects  included  loan  covenants  to  encourage  implementing  the  recommended \nmeasures  to  improve  road  maintenance.  They  required  the  Government  of  Tajikistan  to \nincrease financing for road maintenance by 15% annually, whereas in the Kyrgyz Republic it \nwas set to increase at least at the same rate as increases in the overall national budget. \nAlthough the governments have made substantial progress in improving road maintenance \nfinancing, given the size of the road network, the difficult mountainous terrain, and continued \nbudgetary constraints relative to demand, further work is needed to improve road maintenance. \n \n32.  The Project will develop and implement a program on outsourcing road maintenance \noperations to the domestic private sector. This will be achieved through a two-pronged approach \n(para. 27), and introduce PBM contracts to be tendered to the domestic private sector on a pilot \nbasis. The program will be implemented over 5 years at an investment cost of $8 million ($4 \nmillion in each country). The PBM contracts will cover approximately 1,000 km of roads (500 km in \neach country). These segments may be selected along the Dushanbe\u2013Kyrgyz Border, Osh\u2013Sary \nTash\u2013Irkeshtam, and Sary Tash\u2013Karamik roads, as well as on other roads directly linking to them. \nIn the first year, the program will develop the outsourcing program; provide necessary training to \nthe private sector, KGZMOTC, and TAJMOTC; select roads for maintenance under PBM; and \nprepare PBM contract packages. The PBM contracts will be awarded in the second year and for \nperiods of about 4 years. Roads included in the PBM will undergo periodic maintenance in the first \nyear  and  routine  and  recurrent  maintenance  in  the  following  years.23 ADB  will  finance  the \npreparation  works  via  a  consulting  services  contract  for  the  construction  supervision  and \ninstitutional support component. Financing for the PBM contracts will come from EAs\u2019 regular \nbudgets for road maintenance, and the Project will catalyze maintenance funds and, thus, \n                                                 \n23 Types of road maintenance are explained in Supplementary Appendix A.  \n ", "11 \nfacilitate greater interest from the private sector to participate in road sector development. This \nwill ensure sustainable financing after the Project is completed. The concept of PBM contracts is \nadopted from the Road Network Development Project24 in Nepal, with necessary modifications, \nand is described in Supplementary Appendix A. \n \nD.  Project Investment Plan \n \n33.  The project investment cost including taxes and duties is estimated at $116 million. The \nTajikistan component is estimated at $76.5 million and Kyrgyz Republic component at $39.5 \nmillion.

ADF IX Grant \n34.  A  policy  paper  on  Revising  the  Framework  for  Asian  Development  Fund  Grants  was \napproved by the Board on 26 September 2007. According to the policy paper, the Kyrgyz Republic \nand is classified as country with high risks of debt distress, and Tajikistan is classified as moderate \nrisk, and therefore eligible to receive 100% and 50% grant assistance, accordingly. \n  \nF.  Financing Plan \n35.  Kyrgyz Republic Component. The Government of the Kyrgyz Republic has requested \nADB to provide a grant not exceeding $25.6 million from its Special Funds resources to help \n                                                 \n24 ADB. 2001.

The Government will provide counterpart \nfinancing of $13.9 million to cover (i) taxes related to the civil works, (ii) border infrastructure \nimprovement works, and (iii) performance-based maintenance contracts. \n \n36.  Tajikistan Component. The Government of Tajikistan has requested ADB to provide a \na loan in Special Drawing Rights equivalent to $40.9 million and a grant not exceeding $12.5 \nmillion from its Special Funds resources to help finance the Tajikistan component of the Project. \nThe proposed loan and grant will finance 70% of the Tajikistan component of the project cost. \nThe Government will provide counterpart financing of $23.1 million to cover (i) taxes related to \nthe civil works and consulting services, (ii) border infrastructure improvement works, and (iii) \nperformance-based maintenance contracts.  \n \n37.  The proposed ADB loan will have a term of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years, \nwith interest charged at the rate of 1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per \nannum thereafter.

Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Project Management \n38.  TAJMOTC and KGZMOTC are the EAs for ongoing ADB-financed projects and will \nserve as such for the proposed project. The existing PIUs25 under each of the EAs will (i) \nmonitor the progress of day-to-day project implementation, (ii) prepare withdrawal applications, \n(iii) prepare project progress reports, and (iv) maintain project accounts and complete financial \nrecords for auditing the Project. The directors of the existing PIUs will be responsible for the \nday-to-day supervision of implementation activities. The PIU directors will be supported by \nadditional professional staff26 that will appointed prior to mobilization of the civil works contracts. \nExisting PIUs will also be responsible for advance contracting activities. The PBM components \nof the Project will be implemented by the roads departments of the TAJMOTC and KGZMOTC, \n                                                 \n25 KGZMOTC has combined all PIUs under the single Project Implementation Department for all transport sector \ninvestments projects under the Order 68 dated 9 April 2007. \n26 Both MOTC PIUs will require staff with expertise and experience in road engineering, construction supervision, and \nmonitoring social safeguards. In addition, TAJMOTC PIU will require accounting, procurement specialist, and \nsupport staff. \n ", "13 \nwhich will be supported by the individual consultants engaged under the institutional support \ncomponent of the Project. Existing PIUs will play coordinating roles and provide necessary \nsupport to the roads departments, in particular to (i) coordinate communication between ADB \nand the roads departments; (ii) assist roads departments in matters related to the contracts \nprocurement; and (iii) report on the implementation of the PBM component quarterly to ADB, \nMOTC, and the Ministry of Finance with inputs from roads departments. ADB has been working \nclosely with the EAs for several years on other road projects and believes the EAs have, with \nconsultants\u2019  support,  the  required  capacity  to  manage  the  Project  effectively.  Tajikistan\u2019s \nCustoms Service and Kyrgyz State Customs Committee are currently implementing the ADB-\nfinanced Regional Customs Modernization and Infrastructure Development Project and will be \nthe EAs for implementing the border facility improvement component, with the existing PIUs \nproviding day-to-day implementation of the respective project components. Road and border \nimprovement components will be closely coordinated among the EAs. \n \n2.  Implementation Schedule \n39.  The Project is expected to be implemented over 5 years, from January 2008 to March \n2013. The road corridor improvement works will be implemented in (i) 34 months from January \n2008 to October 2010 under the Tajikistan component, and (ii) 31 months from April 2008 to \nOctober 2010 under the Kyrgyz Republic component. This includes contractors mobilization but \nnot the defects liability period. The PBM components in both countries will be implemented in \nabout  4  years,  from  2009  to  2013.  The  border  infrastructure  improvement  works  will  be \nimplemented during 2009\u20132010 to be completed in parallel with road improvement works. \nSummary implementation schedules are shown in Appendix 5. To ensure that project activities \nare initiated and completed on a timely basis, detailed implementation plans, including activities \nand a resources tracking system, are given in Appendix 6. These schedules will be further \nrefined  during  the  project  inception  mission  and  uploaded  to  the  project  website  for  joint \nmonitoring by the Government and ADB.  \n \n3.  Procurement \n40.  Contracts estimated at $1.0 million and more for civil works will be procured through \ninternational competitive bidding procedures (ICB), and contracts estimated from $100,000 to \nless than $1.0 million will be procured following national competitive bidding (NCB) procedures \nas  described  in  the  Project\u2019s  procurement  plan  (Appendix  7).  Civil  works  for  the  road \nimprovement  works  have  been  packaged  into  six  contracts  (three  in  each  country)  to  be \nprocured following ICB procedures. Contractors will be required to produce detailed design and \nworking drawings under the contract; and EAs will provide detailed survey and investigation \ndetails, including details of topographic surveys, carried out at the PPTA stage. The border \ninfrastructure improvement component has been packaged into one civil works contract in each \ncountry, and the PBM road maintenance component has been packaged into 10 contracts (five \nin each country). Civil works for border infrastructure and PBM components will be procured \nfollowing national procurement laws of the respective countries. The procurement plan will be \nreviewed  regularly,  amended  as  necessary,  and  cover  at  least  the  next  18  months  of \nprocurement activities during project implementation. All procurement to be financed by ADB \nunder the Project will be carried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, \nas amended from time to time). \n \n41.  As the governments of the Kyrgyz Republic and Tajikistan accord high priority to the \nProject and aim for its timely completion, ADB approved advance contracting for civil works. The \nadvance contracting, up to but not including signing of contracts, will cover tendering and bid \n ", "14 \nevaluation for the civil works contract packages. The governments have been advised that \nADB\u2019s approval of advance contracting does not commit ADB to approve and finance the \nproject or the procurement cost. \n \n4.  Consulting Services \n42.  The  Project  will  require  total  of  683  person-months  of  consulting  services  for  the \nTajikistan\u2019s component and 430 person-months for the Kyrgyz Republic component. Consulting \nfirm services will be provided for (i) construction supervision, including training for the domestic \nprivate sector and tendering out PBM contracts; (ii) project benefits monitoring and evaluation; \nand (iii) project  management. International consulting services for 65  person-months  will be \nprovided  for  the  Tajikistan  component  of  the  Project  and  59  person-months  for  the  Kyrgyz \nRepublic component. These consultants will also provide on-the-job training for the counterpart \nstaff. The international consulting services will be assisted by 568 person-months of national \nconsulting services for the Tajikistan component and 321 person-months for the Kyrgyz Republic \ncomponent. National consultants will provide expertise in construction supervision and contract \nmanagement, and will monitor the social and poverty impacts of the Project through household \nsurveys and data analysis. Outline terms of references for consulting services are in Appendix 8. \nFifty (twenty-five in each country) person-months of individual international consulting services \nand 50 (25 in each country) person-months of individual national consulting services will be \nprovided each for the Kyrgyz Republic and Tajikistan components to support TAJMOTC and \nKGZMOTC in outsourcing road maintenance activities to the private sector and introducing best \npractices in preventive road maintenance. Outline terms of references for individual consulting \nservices are in Supplementary Appendix B. All consultants to be financed under the Project will be \nrecruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended \nfrom time to time). \n   \n5.  Disbursement Arrangements \n43.  The  ADB  loan  and  grant  proceeds  for  the  proposed  Project  will  be  disbursed  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (January 2007, as amended from time to \ntime). To facilitate project implementation and funds flow, imprest accounts will be established \nupon loan effectiveness at a commercial bank acceptable to ADB and will be exclusively used to \nfinance ADB\u2019s share of eligible expenditures. For the Tajikistan component, the grant imprest \naccount  will  be  used  mostly  for  consulting  services  and  will  be  managed  by  TAJMOTC. \nKGZMOTC will manage an imprest account for the Kyrgyz Republic component. The initial \nadvance to be deposited to the imprest accounts will not exceed either 6 months of estimated \nexpenditures or 10% of the loan and/or grant amount, whichever is lower. To expedite funds \nflow and simplify the documentation process, the statement of expenditures procedure will be \nused for liquidating and replenishing the imprest account for eligible expenditures not exceeding \n$50,000 per individual payment. The payments in excess of statement of expenditures ceiling \nwill be liquidated or replenished based on the supporting documentation process. For the civil \nworks contracts under the Project, direct payment procedures will apply. \n  \n44.  Financial  management  assessment  (Supplementary  Appendix  E)  of  each  EA  was \nconducted  and  it  concluded  that  the  associated  risks  are  low  due  to  their  considerable \nexperience with donor-funded projects. Timely disbursement of the governments\u2019 counterpart \nfunding for the Project and hiring and retaining competent financial management staff were \nidentified as particular concerns, and the specific assurances for the Project duly reflect this. \n \n ", "15 \n45.  ADB  financing  under  the  Project  will  be  utilized  in  accordance  with  the  tables  to \nschedules 3A and 3B of the Financing Agreement for the Tajikistan component and Schedule \n2A of the Grant Agreement for the Kyrgyz Republic component. The Tajikistan component will \nbe financed from two different funding sources, specifically:  \n(i)  the civil works category will be financed from two funding sources and co-shared \nbetween ADB grant (22%) and ADB loan (78%), which will be applied to every \nclaim. To withdraw the funds from three different sources, a separate withdrawal \napplication needs to be submitted for payment from ADB loan and ADB grant. To \npromote  efficiency  in  processing  disbursements  from  three  different  sources \nunder the Project, a minimum value per withdrawal application is set at $100,000 \nequivalent or the amount determined to be a reasonable minimum; and \n(ii)  the consulting services category will be financed 100% from the ADB grant. \n \n6.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n46.  The EAs will prepare and submit to ADB quarterly and annual progress reports on \nproject implementation in the format and content agreed with ADB. The EAs will maintain \nseparate accounts for all project components and have these audited by an independent auditor \nwith adequate knowledge and experience of international accounting practices and acceptable \nto ADB. The audited project accounts and the auditor\u2019s reports, including a separate opinion on \nuse of the imprest account and the statement of expenditure procedures, will be provided to \nADB within 6 months after the end of each fiscal year. The governments have been informed of \nADB\u2019s requirement for timely submission of audited project accounts and financial statements, \nincluding the suspension of disbursements in case of noncompliance. To facilitate evaluation of \nthe Project, the governments agreed to provide a project completion report to ADB within 3 \nmonths of the Project\u2019s physical completion. \n \n7.  Anticorruption Policy \n47.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the officials of the two governments and the EAs. Consistent with its commitment to good \ngovernance, accountability, and transparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or \nthrough its agents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the \nProject. To support these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included \nin the loan and/or grant regulations and bidding documents for the Project. In particular, all \ncontracts financed by ADB in connection with the Project will include provisions specifying the \nright of ADB to audit and examine the records and accounts of the EAs and all contractors, \nsuppliers,  consultants,  and  other  service  providers  as  they  relate  to  the  Project.  The \ngovernments are committed to creating and sustaining a corruption-free environment and have \nagreed  to  abide  by  the  relevant  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s  anticorruption  policy  in  preparing  all \ndocuments and contracts during the bidding process and project implementation.  \n \n48.  As  an  additional  measure  to  improve  governance,  accountability,  and  transparency \nunder the project, the EAs will establish a website that will present information on externally \nfunded  projects.  For  this  project,  the  website  will  provide  information  on,  among  others, \nprocurement  activities  including  lists  of  participating  bidders  and/or  consultants,  names  of \nwinning bidders and/or consultants, basic details on bidding and/or recruitment procedures \nadopted, amounts of contracts awarded, lists of goods and/or services purchased, and those \nitems\u2019 intended use. \n  \n ", "16 \n8.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n49.  ADB  and  the  EAs  agreed  upon  a  preliminary  set  of  indicators  for  monitoring  and \nevaluating project performance in relation to its impacts and outcomes as indicated in the \nProject\u2019s design and monitoring framework. At the beginning of project implementation, the EAs \nwill confirm baseline values for social and economic impact indicators. Monitoring indicators will \nbe measured, with the necessary frequency, during project implementation. Comments and \nfindings regarding these project indicators will be incorporated into each annual report to ADB. \nIn addition to indicators for implementation monitoring, indicators for project evaluation will be \nmeasured at project completion as well as 1 year and 3 years after completion. Participatory \nsurveys will take place, and results will be compared with the baseline. A final report will \nevaluate  changes  that  occurred  in  the  preceding  3  years.  The  EAs  have  developed  their \nmonitoring capabilities for the ongoing projects and have the capacity to monitor the Project. To \nfacilitate assessment of the Project\u2019s socioeconomic impact, an international consultant will be \nrecruited to monitor and evaluate all relevant project impacts. \n \n9.  Coordination Meetings \n50.  Representatives of the Kyrgyz Republic, PRC, Tajikistan, and ADB will meet once a \nyear, alternatively in Bishkek and Dushanbe, to discuss the project implementation status, \nresolve common problems, and, most importantly, ensure full implementation of the CBA. The \ngovernment  of  the  organizing  country  will  finance  the  costs  incurred  in  preparing  for  and \nattending these meetings through the project management accounts of their respective loan \nand/or grant components.  \n \n10.  Project Review \n51.  ADB and the governments will carry out two midterm reviews of the Project: one in 2009 \nfor the road and border infrastructure components and another in 2011 for the PBM road \nmaintenance components. The reviews will focus on project outputs and milestone activities, \nparticularly those relating to institutional, administrative, technical, environmental, resettlement, \nand social aspects. The Project\u2019s economic viability and other relevant aspects that may impact \non project performance will also be assessed. The reviews will examine the implementation \nprogress for the policy reforms and compliance with assurances specified in the financing and \ngrant agreements. \n \nH.  Stakeholders\u2019 Participation and Consultation \n52.  During the project preparation activities\u2014including ADB missions, feasibility studies, \nenvironmental impact assessment, social surveys, and resettlement planning\u2014consultations \nwere  carried  out  with  governments,  embassies  of  Afghanistan  and  the  PRC,  international \ndonors and aid agencies, nongovernment organizations, local communities, road users, and \nother  stakeholders  of  the  Project.  The  consultations  covered  major  issues  such  as  road \nalignment, transport services, project benefits, and social and environmental impacts of the \nProject.  The  results showed  a  high  degree of  public support,  as well  as  support  from  all \ngovernments concerned with the Project. Consultations with the stakeholders are summarized \nin Supplementary Appendix C.  \n \n ", "17 \nIV.  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE  \n53.  The Project will be accompanied by regional TA to help prepare the CBA among the \nKyrgyz Republic, PRC, and Tajikistan. The CBA will facilitate smooth transborder movement of \npeople, goods, and vehicles and remove nonphysical barriers to regional trade and transport. \nThe outcome of the TA is a CBA signed by the governments of the Kyrgyz Republic, PRC, and \nTajikistan prior to completion of physical works under the Project. In preparing the CBA, the \nconsultants  will:  (i)  review  operations  of  the  border,  immigration,  customs,  and  quarantine \nfacilities; (ii) review existing customs and transport documentation; (iii) identify physical and \nnonphysical barriers, both inland and at border posts, and recommend measures for their \nremoval;  (iv)  hold  consultations  with  involved  government  officials  to  establish  agreeable \ndocumentation and procedures for drivers, vehicles, and goods; and (v) facilitate regularly \nmeetings  and  reaching  an  agreement  on  CBA  terms  and  conditions.  The  TA  will  be \nimplemented  over  24  months  and  finance  the  services  of  international  consultants  for  24 \nperson-months and national consultants for 10 person-months. The total cost of the TA is \nestimated at $550,000. The TA will be financed on a grant basis from ADB\u2019s TA funding \nprogram in the amount of $500,000. ADB will be the EA for the TA, and the Government of the \nKyrgyz Republic will provide in-kind contribution estimated at $50,000 by providing office space \nfor the consultants, administrative support and counterpart staff. The outline terms of reference \nfor the consulting services are in Supplementary Appendix D. \n \nV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \nA.  Benefits \n54.  By improving the road corridor from Dushanbe to the Kyrgyz-PRC border, the Project will \nsubstantially reduce the obstruction to trade and will facilitate regional trade. The entire region \nwill benefit from the Project, while the immediate project area will benefit through economic \ngrowth and increased access to markets and social services. Improving the road will boost \nagricultural production, contribute to mining industry development, and generate employment \nopportunities. \n \n1.  Traffic Forecast \n55.  Traffic forecasts for the Project were based on the following four key assumptions: (i) \npolitical stability and strong macroeconomic performance in the Kyrgyz Republic and Tajikistan; \n(ii) continued commitment of the governments of Kyrgyz Republic, PRC, and Tajikistan to \nregional cooperation; (iii) continued external assistance to the road subsector in the Kyrgyz \nRepublic and Tajikistan; and (iv) completion of interlinking road projects. The forecasts were \nmade for the 2008\u20132031 period and based on expected growth in GDP, income elasticities of \ndemand, and analysis of regional trade patterns (Appendix 9). The total traffic (domestic and \ninternational) is expected to grow at an average annual rate of 8.3% for all vehicle types, \nreaching a distance-weighted average of 2,000 vehicles per day in 2025. Generated traffic was \nestimated at 20% of normal traffic, and it is expected to grow at the same rate as normal traffic. \nIn  addition,  there  are  anthracite  mines,  in  both,  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  and  Tajikistan,  and \nexpected construction of a new dam and hydropower station at Rogun in Tajikistan along the \nCorridor. It was assumed, based on the current status of negotiations of the Kyrgyz Republic \nand Tajikistan governments with potential investors in the concessions, that these projects will \nsoon start and generate additional traffic. The traffic thus generated accounts for 30% of total \ntraffic and was incorporated into the analysis.  \n \n ", "18 \n56.  International traffic is minimal at present, but it is expected to grow rapidly once the \nCorridor is improved. The international generated traffic forecast was based on an analysis of \ntrade patterns in the region. Four freight traffic projections were examined based on the similar \nanalysis under the Phase II road project in Tajikistan: (i) Tajikistan-Kyrgyz Republic trade, (ii) \nTajikistan-PRC trade, (iii) Afghanistan-PRC trade, and (iv) vehicle imports from the PRC. It is \nprojected that it will grow from currently less than 10 to over 1,000 vehicles per day by 2031 \n(50% of the total traffic), of which more than 50% will be heavy commercial vehicles. About 30% \nof this projected international traffic will be destined to or originate from Tajikistan, 4% to or from \nthe Kyrgyz Republic, and 66% to or from Afghanistan. Total projected international traffic will \nreach 760 vehicles per day by 2030. It is possible that other international traffic may be diverted \nfrom rail or other modes of transport. Potential benefits related to the latter are much smaller \nand therefore disregarded in this analysis.   \n \n2.  Economic Analysis \n57.  The economic analysis entailed projecting costs and benefits with- and without-project in \naccordance with ADB guidelines.27 The difference between the with- and without-project cost \nand benefits streams represents the net benefits of the Project. The economic analysis covers \n23 years (2008\u20132031), comprising 3 years of construction and 20 years of operation. The least-\ncost option was selected amongst mutually exclusive project alternatives and various pavement \ntreatment options. Details of the economic analysis are in Appendix 9. \n \n58.  The major benefits of the Project are (i) reduced road user costs28 to normal traffic and \nadditional  traffic  from  coal  mines  and  the  hydroelectric  project,  (ii)  increased  producer  and \nconsumer surplus accruing to generated domestic traffic, (iii) benefits from generated and diverted \ninternational transit traffic, and (iv) increased agricultural production and incomes in Tajikistan. \nThe project costs include resource cost of road improvement and maintenance throughout the \nproject life. These costs were estimated in financial terms and factored by 0.8529 to convert \nthem to economic terms. Both costs and benefits are expressed in constant US dollars at mid-\n2007 price levels. \n \n59.  The economic internal rate of return (EIRR) for the overall Project is 18.1%, and the net \npresent  value  is  $37.6  million,  using  a  12%  discount  rate.  Considering  benefits  accruing \nseparately, the EIRR is 17.9% for Tajikistan and 14.5% for the Kyrgyz Republic. Most of the \nbenefits accrue to international traffic (54%), followed by savings in road user costs (27%), \ngreater agricultural production (17%), and time and domestic generated traffic benefits (2%). \nSensitivity analysis tested the effects of negative changes in key parameters determining project \nbenefits  and  costs.  The  sensitivity  analysis  indicated  that  the  Project  would  maintain  its \neconomic viability with an EIRR of 13.7% even under the most adverse scenario. A distribution \nanalysis was made to capture project benefits by country. The analysis shows that Tajikistan \nwould receive 70% of net benefits, the Kyrgyz Republic 20.5%, the PRC 9.3%, and Afghanistan \n0.2%. Tajikistan\u2019s share of international benefits would be 42% and the Kyrgyz Republic\u2019s 38%. \nThe distribution of benefits is in Appendix 9. The Project is expected to help boost regional trade, \nparticularly between the Kyrgyz Republic and Tajikistan. Their bilateral trade is expected to \ngrow from 27,236 tons in 2006 to about 250,000 tons in 2015. Tajikistan-PRC trade is forecast \nto rise from 14,260 tons in 2006 to about 1 million tons in 2015, and PRC-Afghanistan trade \nfrom 0 to about 500,000 tons in the same period. \n                                                 \n27 ADB. 1997.

Social and Poverty Impacts  \n60.  The Project is not a targeted poverty intervention. Nevertheless, it will have a poverty \nreduction impact and benefits. Social and poverty assessments were undertaken separately for \neach country under PPTA. A consolidated summary poverty reduction and social strategy for \nthe two countries is in Appendix 10. The Project indirectly benefits the poor through increased \nmobility and accessibility to markets and social services in the project area; lower transport \ncosts  for  inputs  and  products;  better  access  to  and  interaction  with  other  regions;  and \nemployment  opportunities  during  and  after  construction  owing  to  increased  coal  mining, \nurbanization, and other economic activities. Specifically, the Project will indirectly benefit (i) \nabout 228,000 people from three communities in Tajikistan, among whom 100,800, or 44%, are \npoor; and (ii) about 29,000 people from two communities in the Kyrgyz Republic, of which 52% \nare poor. A further quarter of beneficiaries are considered vulnerable. Poverty levels in the \nproject area are higher than respective national averages, which are 43% for both countries.30 \nThe most predominant livelihood sector, whether on a regular or irregular basis, is agriculture \n(including vegetables, processing of farm and meat products), and it is the main source of \nincome for 45% of households in Tajikistan and 39% of households in the Kyrgyz Republic. \nIndirectly,  the  project  will  promote  the  intensification  and  higher  profitability  of  agricultural \nproduction and lead to substantially reduced poverty. There is potential in the project area to \nimprove  yields  of  the  main  commercial  crops  of  potatoes,  apple,  and  pears  if  agricultural \nextension services are simultaneously improved and provided. The poor could benefit more \nthan others from agricultural improvements, because their growth potential is higher or their \ncurrent  level  of  production  is  lower.  Poverty  reduction  in  the  long  run  will  depend  on \nimprovements in agriculture. About 15% of the beneficiaries in Tajikistan and 60% in the Kyrgyz \nRepublic own some form of transportation, of which about two thirds is owned by the poor, \nmostly in the forms of such nonmotorized transport as bicycles and animal-drawn carts. About \none third of motorized transport owners are poor, yet there is a highly competitive market of \nowner-drivers. Therefore, vehicle operating cost savings are likely to be passed on to the poor \nin the form of reduced costs, fares, and charges. \n \n61.  The Project is expected to help poor and nonpoor alike, as it will contribute to regionally \nbalanced and equitable economic growth by (i) improving access to marketing and employment \nopportunities;  (ii)  facilitating  access  to  key  social  services;  (iii)  supporting  and  stimulating \nagricultural production; (iv) promoting trade, encouraging livelihood diversification, and enabling \ninformation exchange; (v) improving a key component of regional and rural infrastructure and \nreducing  widening  gaps  in  living  standards  and  economic  opportunities  between  the \nmountainous and flatland areas; and (vi) removing one of the development constraints on poor \nand rural communities. Overall, connectivity will increase transborder trade and transportation, \nas well as tourism development. Farmers will easily transport their fruits and vegetables to \ninternal markets (primarily Bishkek, Naryn, and Osh) and externally (Kazakhstan, Russia, and \nUzbekistan). In Tajikistan, a $2 million grant from the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction will link \ncommunities to the road and restore a flood-destroyed bridge that will complement the Project \nand enhance social and poverty impacts for the communities involved.  \n \n62.   The Kyrgyz Republic and Tajikistan are at early stages of the HIV/AIDS epidemic. \nHIV/AIDS has been identified, however, as a potential risk. Ongoing Phase II of the ADB-\nfinanced Dushanbe\u2013Kyrgyz Border Road Rehabilitation Project (footnote 6) in Tajikistan and the \nSouthern  Transport  Corridor  Road  Rehabilitation  Project  in  Kyrgyz  Republic  (footnote  20) \n                                                 \n30 World Bank. 2006.

This includes clinical support through \nproviding HIV testing kits and treatment packages for sexually transmitted infections. Both \nprojects deal with project zones and thus cover current project areas. Furthermore, specific \nprovisions for HIV/AIDS prevention will be included in the biddings documents for civil works \nwith built-in monitoring and awareness campaigns.  \n \nC.  Social Safeguards  \n63.  All civil works in both countries will take place either within the existing rights-of-way or \non unused state-owned land. No major relocation of households or acquisition of productive \nland is expected. If the Project needs new borrow pits or quarries, these are expected to be \nlocated  on  unused  state-owned  land.  The  Project  will  affect  27  families  (228  persons)  in \nTajikistan and no families will be affected in the Kyrgyz Republic. The 27 plots affected are \nsmall parcels of land occupied by houses and by sheds that encroach upon the road corridor. In \nall, these land-use impacts amount to 1,843 square meters (m2). Seven houses are affected for \na total of 839 m2, and the 24 sheds affected total 1,004 m2. All houses but two are modestly \naffected and based on the choice of their owners will not be relocated. There are 62 poplars and \nwillow  trees  affected.  A  short  resettlement  plan  (RP)  was  prepared  in  accordance  with \nTajikistan\u2019s  laws  and  regulations  and  ADB\u2019s  Involuntary  Resettlement  Policy  (1995).  The \nresettlement strategy, compensation standards, entitlements, and rehabilitation measures were \nbased on impact surveys and consultations with local authorities, communities, and affected \nhouseholds. Demolishment of structures and properties on the right-of-way will be completed \nwithin 2008, and compensation of $103,000 will be paid from the Government\u2019s counterpart \nfunds prior to commencing civil works. Appendix 11 summarizes the short resettlement plan. \n \n64.  Project areas both in the Kyrgyz and Tajik sides are inhabited by Kyrgyz and Tajik \npeople. In both countries, the two ethnic groups live in harmony and participate equally in the \nmarket economy, local politics, and national cultural processes. There are no groups with \ncharacteristics of indigenous people (as defined by ADB\u2019s Policy on Indigenous People, 1998) \naffected by the Project. \n \nD.  Environmental Impacts  \n65.  The  Project\u2019s  environmental  classification  is  Category  B.  Two  initial  environmental \nexaminations (IEEs) of the Project and a consolidated Summary IEE (SIEE) were carried out \nunder  the  PPTA  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy  (2002)  and  Environmental \nAssessment Guidelines (2003). Based on results of the IEEs, the Project is not expected to \ngenerate significant environmental impacts provided the mitigation measures outlined in the \nIEEs are implemented appropriately. The consolidated SIEE is in Supplementary Appendix E. \nThe environmental management plan as detailed in the IEEs and SIEE includes mitigation \nmeasures and a monitoring program for both construction and operation phases of the Project.   \n \nE.  Project Assumptions and Risks \n66.  The Project was designed with reasonable assumptions and keeping in mind the risks that \ncould  prevent  the  Project\u2019s  intended  outcome  and/or  impact  from  fully  materializing.  Key \nassumptions are (i) continued political stability, strong economic performance, and commitment for \nregional cooperation among the Kyrgyz Republic,  PRC, and Tajikistan; (ii) continued external \nassistance and governments\u2019 commitment to developing the road subsector in the Kyrgyz Republic \nand Tajikistan; and (iii) timely provision of counterpart funding and support from local governments.   \n ", "21 \n \n67.  The main Project risks include: (i) forecasted international traffic does not materialize, and \n(ii) cost overruns due to sharp escalation of prices for construction materials and labor. Given the \ncurrent economic development perspectives in the region and trends in the region\u2019s trade and \ntransport turnover, it is anticipated that forecasted traffic levels will, indeed, materialize. It is \nexpected that the economies of the regional countries will grow at least at the same pace as \ncurrently and, most likely, growth will strengthen even further. Reasonable price escalation factors \nwere incorporated into the cost estimates to minimize the risk of project cost overrun. Based on \nthe current trend in world prices for major construction inputs, escalation of the project costs \nbeyond the incorporated reasonable assumptions is unlikely. Based on these assumptions and \nthe likelihood of risks, it is expected that the Project\u2019s benefits and impacts will outweigh its costs. \n \nVI.  ASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \nA.  Specific Assurances \n68.  In addition to the standard assurances, the Governments of the Kyrgyz Republic and \nTajikistan (the Governments), have given the following assurances, which are incorporated in \nthe respective legal documents: \n \n(i)  Counterpart Funding.

Subsector Description \n \n1.  The  road  subsector  is  the  most  important  component  of  transport  in  Tajikistan  and \ndominates the domestic transport of goods and passengers. The combined length of the road \nnetwork is about 31,800 kilometers (km), consisting of 4,870 km of national roads (republican and \ninternational) and 27,000 km of local roads. The Ministry of Transport and Communications \n(MOTC) has jurisdiction over all of the national roads and 8,920 km of local roads. The major part \nof the network was constructed before 1970 and was not built to support increased vehicle axle \nloads and weight standards. Inadequate maintenance, damage from civil conflict, and frequent \nnatural disasters have left the network in a state of severe deterioration. It is estimated that 80% of \nthe national road network is in poor or very poor condition.1 While the extent of the network is \nconsidered adequate to accommodate existing traffic levels, the condition of the network limits \naccess and mobility, thus restricting road transport\u2019s contribution to economic growth, poverty \nreduction, and social development. The poor condition of many roads has lowered travel speeds, \nincreased fuel consumption, and raised vehicle operating costs. \n \n2.  Road transport carried 26 million tons of freight (70% of total) in 2006, which is 10% of \nthe 1991 volume but twice the 2000 volume. In terms of turnover, road transport has gradually \ntaken over from railways. In 2006, it carried 1,776 million ton-km as compared to 1,214 million \nton-km carried by railways, whereas in 2000 roads carried 422 million ton-km and railways \n1,326  million  ton-km.  Passenger  transportation  has  traditionally  been  dominated  by  road \ntransport, and it returned to 1991 levels in 2006 with about 370 million passengers transported. \n \nB.  Road Administration \n \n3.  Prior to ADB\u2019s involvement with Tajikistan\u2019s transport sector, the Transport Department \nunder the Office of the President acted as the central point of coordination for the transport \nsector. Development planning for the subsectors was the responsibility of separate government \norganizations. The Ministry of Transport and Roads served as the national agency for road \ninfrastructure management. It managed road transport enterprises, allocated budgets, assigned \nwork, and managed personnel. The Tajik Railway Company served as the agency for railways, \nwhile the Tajikistan State Air Company served as the agency for civil aviation and airports. Each \norganization was responsible for preparing development plans and investment programs for its \nown subsector. During implementation of the development plans, the Office of the President \nprovided coordination for review and revision of the investment programs and for allocating \ninvestment funds among the subsectors. \n \n4.  As a result of policy dialogue with and technical assistance from ADB, the administration \nof the transport sector was reorganized and the Ministry of Transport (MOT) was created in \n2001. It was responsible for all transport infrastructure, including roads, railways, and airports. It \nassumed responsibility for telecommunications in November 2006 and became the Ministry of \nTransport and Communications (MOTC). MOTC is now in charge of sector policy, regulation, \nplanning, operations, and investment. It is guided by the Office of the President, Ministry of \nFinance, and State Committee on Investments and State Property Management, which are \ninvolved  in  developing  the  Government\u2019s  overall  reform  program  and  prioritizing  capital \nexpenditures. The MOTC is divided into eight departments and is headed by the minister, who \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2007.

It performs its policy-making and planning functions through \nthe  Department  of  Analysis  and  Economic  Forecasting,  while  line  departments  of  each \nsubsector are responsible primarily for subsector regulations and operations. \n \nC.  Road Standards and Safety \n \n5.  Tajikistan\u2019s road standards and specifications are based on those of the former Soviet \nUnion (FSU). Several studies have indicated that the design standards of FSU state roads \nimplemented in Tajikistan\u2019s national roads are sometimes higher than those of the United States \nor European countries. However, they do not always result in optimum road design. For lower-\nstandard roads, FSU standards for design speed and cross sections are similar to those used in \ndeveloping countries, but for higher-category roads, they are excessive. The construction quality \nof  Tajikistan\u2019s  roads  is  generally  inadequate,  mainly  because  of  a  lack  of  cost-effective \nconstruction techniques and independent construction supervision.  \n \n6.  The  Transport  Safety  and  Security  Unit  of  MOTC\u2019s  Transport  Policy  Department  is \nresponsible  for  the  physical  aspects  of  road  safety,  including  road  conditions  and  signs. \nTajikistan\u2019s road safety record in the mid-1990s was poor, with a fatality rate of 407 per 10,000 \nvehicles.2Road safety has improved since then because of MOTC\u2019s Accident Prevention Plan, \n \nwhich monitors about 30 indicators annually. Although the number of vehicles has increased \nsubstantially, the rates of road accidents and fatalities have remained relatively stable. In 2005, \nthere were a total 1,724 registered road accidents (a decrease of 5% from 2000) with resulting \nfatalities of 483 (3.5% increase from 2000) and an additional 2,036 people injured. In the project \narea, the number of accidents decreased from 22 involving 28 fatalities in 2003 to 13 accidents \nand 14 fatalities in 2005, then to 10 accidents and seven fatalities in 2006. \n \n7.  Overloaded vehicles cause roads to deteriorate prematurely. Tajikistan is a party to the \nIntergovernmental Agreement on Vehicle Dimension and Weights which has been signed by 10 \nCommonwealth of Independent States countries. Two national decrees have been issued to make it \neffective3but are not enforced because vehicle-weighing equipment is lacking. The agreement and \n \nthe decrees require that overloaded vehicles obtain a special permit to enter Tajikistan and the other \ncountries, which are allowed to charge for it. In practice, while Tajikistan issues permits jointly \nthrough MOTC, the Ministry of State Revenue, and the Ministry of Internal Affairs, there is no \nschedule of payments and, therefore, no payments are being collected. The Government has \nissued another decree4 setting the levels of fees for overloading, and axle-weighing equipment will \nbe procured and installed under the ongoing ADB-financed Loan 2196-TAJ.   \n \nD.  Road Transport Industry  \n \n8.  Major  changes  have  occurred  in  the  road  transport  industry  since  independence, \nespecially in the commercialization and, in some cases, privatization of the industry. In 1998, \nthe Government had jurisdiction over 81 road transport service enterprises. Most intercity bus \nand trucking operations are now organized as joint-stock companies, with various shares of \npublic and private ownership. For example, of the 52 medium and large transport organizations \nthat were formerly part of MOT and designated by the Government for privatization, 73% are \n                                                 \n2  ADB. 1995. Technical Assistance for Regional Initiatives in Road Safety. Manila. \n3 Decree 93 of 11 March 2000 on adoption of the agreement on vehicle dimensions and weights for international \nroad transportation among CIS countries; and Decree 82 of 4 March 2005 on adoption of the agreement to \nintroduce international certificate for weighing cargo vehicles in the territories of CIS countries. \n4  Decree 779 of 29 December 2006 on regulations for vehicles with sizes and axle loads exceeding norms to use \nautomobile roads.  \n ", "30  Appendix 2 \nwholly owned by the Government, 6% are wholly privately owned, and 21% have mixed public-\nprivate ownership. As of March 2002, 5,226 vehicles were operated by joint-stock companies \nand other organizations within MOT. Of these, 3,627 vehicles, or 69%, were operated by four \njoint-stock companies (Badakshonnakliyot, Khatlontrans, Khudjandnaklyot, and Kulyabtrans). \nThe remaining vehicles were operated by other MOT departments, Tajik Air, and Tajik Rail. A \nsignificant portion of trucking and most long-distance bus services are operated by private \ncompanies.  Tariffs  for  road  freight  have  been  completely  deregulated,  and  road  haulage \norganizations enter into agreements with customers at negotiated rates. Tariffs for passenger \ntransport are still regulated. MOTC and the Ministry of Economy jointly establish passenger \ntransport tariffs for buses, minibuses, and taxis for urban and long-distance services. While \nthese official tariffs should be charged by all operators, many bus and minibus operators charge \nmarket fares, according to what they think people will pay. \n \nE.  Road Subsector Revenues and Expenditures \n \n9.  The state budget allocation for road rehabilitation and maintenance varies from year to \nyear, depending on the Government\u2019s priorities and fiscal constraints. Since the Road Fund was \nabolished in 2000 on the recommendation of the International Monetary Fund, funds for the \nroad sector are allocated through the Government\u2019s normal central budgetary process. As a \nresult of general fiscal constraints and allocations to new road construction projects, approved \nbudgets for road maintenance and rehabilitation for the past four years have been only 20% of \nthe amount requested. MOTC gets supplementary budget during the course of the year for any \nemergency responses and additional unforeseen expenditures. Total road maintenance and \nrehabilitation expenditures in 2004 were TJS14.2 million and nearly tripled in 2007 to constitute \nmore than 95% of total expenditures in the road subsector. Despite this progress, the road \nsubsector  remains  greatly  underfinanced.  Only  about  $300  per  km  is  spent  annually  on \nmaintenance, which is very low by any meaningful standards. This spending should be at least \nfour times the current level. Table A2.1 shows budgeted and actual road subsector spending. \n \nTable A2.1: Road Maintenance Budget and Expenditures \n(TJS \u2018000) \nFund Allocation \n2004  2005  2006   2007 \nItem  Budget  Actual  Budget  Actual  Budget  Actual  Budget  Actual \nRoad Maintenance  13,500.0  13,500.0  18,100.0  16,243.3  21,540.0  21,540.0  22,173.0   \nRoad Rehabilitationa  750.0  750.0  4,250.0  4,945.0  6,250.06  6,250.0  24,689,2   \nTotal  14,250.0  14,250.0  22,350.3  21,188.3  27,790.0  27,790.0  46,862.2   \nNew Road Construction                 \nAnzob Tunnel and \n  9,511.1  12,200.0  12,200.0  6,520.0  3,593.0  0.0   \nGulleries \nOther Tunnels and \n12,000.0  9,988.9  6,500.0  5,126.5  4,250.0  4,916.1  0.0   \nroads \nTotal Road Subsector  17.250.0  18,750.0  25,850.3  24,056.5  28,040.0  29,478.8  46,862.2   \na  Includes counterpart funding for 2007 for Dushanbe\u2013Chanak Road financed by loan from the People\u2019s Republic of \nChina. \nSource: Ministry of Transport and Communication\u2019s July Monthly Status Report. \n \n10.  Investments in Tajikistan\u2019s transport sector since the breakup of the Soviet Union are \nmainly driven by the multilateral and bilateral loan and grant assistance that totaled to more than \n$0.5 billion. Almost all of that has been for rehabilitation and constructing roads and tunnels.  \n ", "    Appendix 2       31     \n \nF.  Road Maintenance \n \n11.  MOTC is responsible for planning and coordinating the maintenance of Tajikistan's road \nnetwork.  MOTC  maintains  roads  and  bridges  through  five  regional  road  departments: \nBadakhshan, Dushanbe, Khatlon and Kulyab (combined in 2005), Khudjand, and Rasht. These \nroad  maintenance  departments  are  responsible  for  approximately  13,800  km  of  road  and \nemploy 2,981 people. The departments are state entities attached to MOTC and are composed \nof road maintenance units. None of the departments or maintenance units have been privatized. \nWhile it is the stated intention of MOTC to eventually privatize these, no progress has been \nmade to date. The road maintenance departments prepare annual plans and budgets based on \nsystems established during the Soviet era. This information is then presented to MOTC, which \nin turn allocates funding to the various departments. Each road maintenance unit is responsible \nfor that part of the road network within its jurisdiction, with the actual maintenance being carried \nout by staff who are responsible for specific sections of the road. The plant, equipment, and \nmaterials  available  to  the  workforce,  however,  are  generally  not  sufficient  for  carrying  out \neffective  maintenance  activities.  The  Rasht  Road  Department  and  the  Dushanbe  Road \nDepartment  are  responsible  for  maintenance  of  roads  in  the  Regions  of  Republican \nSubordination. The Rasht Road Department, which is responsible for maintenance of the road \nto be improved under the Project, is responsible for maintaining 885 km of roads, is composed \nof nine road maintenance units, and employs 237 people. The Dushanbe Road Department is \nresponsible for maintaining the road sections being rehabilitated under the first phase. \n \n \n ", "32  Appendix 2 \nROAD SUBSECTOR ANALYSIS  \nKYRGYZ REPUBLIC \n \nA.  Subsector Description \n \n1.  The Kyrgyz Republic is a mountainous, landlocked country. Road transport dominates \nthe country\u2019s transport system, accounting for about 94% of freight tonnage movements and \nalmost all passenger traffic (excluding intra-urban). As with most other former Soviet republics, \nthe  economic  crisis  stemming  from  breakup  of  the  Soviet  Union  resulted  in  a  decline  in \neconomic activity and disrupted customary trading patterns. Demand for transport has fallen \ndramatically since independence. In 2001, freight turnover (measured in ton-kilometers) was \nonly 20% of its 1990 level, and passenger turnover was 57% of its previous level. The lowest \nlevels were reached in 1995 when the freight volumes in ton-km and passenger movement were \nonly 14% and 33% of their respective 1990 levels, reflecting sharp decline in real incomes and \noutput. Demand grew in 1996 and 1997, but freight declined again following the 1998 financial \ncrisis. Passenger transport has been growing at about 6% annually since 1997. \n \n2.  The road network in the Kyrgyz Republic covers all seven provinces (oblasts), and \nprovides connections to remote communities and links to neighboring countries. About 18,900 \nkm of roads are under jurisdiction of the Ministry of Transport and Communications (MOTC), \nincluding 9,900 km of state roads and 9,000 km of local roads. About 40% of the roads are \nsealed, including some with gravel mixed with bitumen binder. Over 50% are gravel and less \nthan 10% are earth roads. Since most of the roads were designed for higher traffic capacity and \nare underutilized, the existing basic transport infrastructure is adequate for the level of economic \nactivity likely to occur in the medium term. Consequently, the primary concern is not expansion \nor  major  upgrading  of  the  transport  system  but  proper  maintenance  and  rehabilitation  to \npreserve the existing network. Roads at all levels are deteriorating; over 60% now require \nextensive  maintenance  or  rehabilitation.  About  15,000  km  of  road  are  outside  MOTC\u2019s \njurisdiction, mainly rural and farm roads. Most were formerly the responsibility of state and \ncollective farms. Following the breakup of the state and collective farm system, the responsibility \nfor maintaining rural and farm roads is now with the district administrations. \n \nB.  Road Administration \n \n3.  The Automobile Roads Act gives the main responsibility for planning and administering \nroad policies, programs, and projects to the MOTC, which is responsible for policy making and \nregulating, planning, and developing transport and communications, including the road, railway, \nand aviation sectors. The Department of Roads, under MOTC, is responsible for managing the \nroad sector. MOTC\u2019s seven regional road maintenance agencies, one in each province, plus the \nBishkek\u2013Osh road Division are responsible for maintaining the state and local roads under \nMOTC\u2019s jurisdiction. The regional road maintenance agencies and Bishkek\u2013Osh road Division \ncomprise 58 local maintenance units that carry out actual maintenance works. Other important \nagencies in the road sector are (i) KyrgyzIntrans, a holding agency for six freight transport \ncompanies and forwarding agencies engaged mainly in international trade; and (ii) technical \nagencies in various stages of divestment from MOTC\u2019s control, including the Road Design \nInstitute (Kyrgyzdortransproekt) and a small agency responsible for developing and testing new \nroad construction techniques and equipment (Kyrgyztranstekhnika). \n \n \n \n \n ", "    Appendix 2       33     \nC.  Road Standards and Safety \n \n4.  The total number of road accidents in the Kyrgyz Republic increased from 1,135 in 1999 \nto 1,555 in 2003. The primary cause of accidents is excessive driving speed on roads in \nmountainous terrain. Many roads outside of the cities pass though mountainous terrain and/or \nalongside  rivers,  with  the  road  alignment  varying  significantly  along  the  same  road  and \nsometimes  changing  suddenly.  The  mountainous  terrain  also  results  in  significant  rockfall \nhazards on many roads. During the winter season, ice and snow-covered roads constitute a \nmajor  safety  hazard.  The  absence  of  rest  areas  and  roadside  service  facilities  over  long \ndistances may also contribute to accidents. \n \n5.  ADB has been involved in improving road safety in the Kyrgyz Republic through the \nSecond Road Rehabilitation Project and Almaty-Bishkek Regional Road Rehabilitation Project \n(Loan  1775-KGZ).  The  former  prepared  a  time-bound  road  safety  program  to  reduce  the \naccident rate. Under the latter, the Government established the Road Safety Committee and the \ncommittee\u2019s secretariat in 2004 to coordinate road safety activities and involve the various \nstakeholders. The secretariat has begun its work, including to prepare a road accident database \nand other safety information. The Government also agreed to update the Road Safety Act for \nsubmission to Parliament. The Act will include legislation concerning safe driving, safety audit \nfor road designs, safety education, road safety publicity, vehicle safety standards, road safety \nresearch, and emergency assistance to accident victims. Advisory technical assistance (TA) \nattached to Loan 1775-KGZ has helped the Government establish the National Road Safety \nCouncil, update the Road Safety Act, prepare a Russian version of Road Safety Guidelines \nprepared under earlier TA, and conduct road safety seminars to implement the guidelines. \n \nD.  Road Transport Industry  \n \n6.  Transport companies were controlled by a joint-stock holding company, Kyrgyz Auto \nTransport, until 1994, when Decree No. 61 abolished the company and transferred its functions \nto  MOTC.  Of  the  total  251  transport  enterprises  in  the  Kyrgyz  Republic,  126  have  been \nprivatized,  primarily  through  conversion  to  joint-stock  companies.  Currently  86  companies \nprovide road transport services; 74 have been privatized. The companies that have not been \nprivatized comprise urban bus enterprises in major cities and some enterprises connected with \nstate  security.  The  transport  companies  employ  about  25,000.  Most  of  the  freight  and \npassenger transport companies operate at the provincial and district (rayon) levels, with a small \nnumber of national operators. As a result of measures that the Government introduced in 1994 \nto  increase  competition,  most  of  the  national  and  provincial  holding  companies  and \nassociations, which had continued to control the operations of individual transport companies, \nwere abolished. \n \n7.  The  Government  continues  to  have  a  strong  influence  in  the  market  for  intercity \npassenger transport. Kyrgyz Transport Inspection, created in MOTC in 1994, issues transport \nlicenses and regulates transport services. The market for freight transport services is more \ncompetitive than that for passenger transport. Freight transport customers are free to negotiate \nconditions of  price  and  arrange  intermodal  transport  services,  thus  facilitating door-to-door \ntransport arrangements, and to offer services directly themselves. However, the Government \nalso  plays  a  large  role  in  freight  transport  through  regulation.  MOTC  is  responsible  for \nmonitoring  and  regulation,  including  licensing,  inspection,  and  safety  audits.  Increased \ncompetition in the market for transport services is necessary to improve transport services and \nensure that the reduction in transport costs is passed on to transport users.  \n \n ", "34  Appendix 2 \nE.

In 2003, the total budget allocation to MOTC for road maintenance was Som255.9 \nmillion, or $5.85 million. This figure was slightly increased in 2004, due to emergency costs, and \nreached Som278.6 million. In addition, the funds allocated to road maintenance constitute less \nthan 30% (27.4% in 2003) of the total allocation to the road sector when external financing for \ncapital  investment  projects  is  taken  into  account.  If  only  budget  allocation  is  considered, \nhowever, the road maintenance allocation to MOTC represents 60\u201365% of the total. \n \n10.  Yearly allocation for road maintenance is usually made up of two parts: the original \nallocation and supplementary allocation. The original allocation in 2003 was Som188.45 million. \nUsually in midyear, following requests for emergency repairs (mostly due to landslides), a \nsupplementary budget is allocated. In 2003, an additional amount of Som67.47 million was \nallocated to MOTC (Som41.4 million for Bishkek\u2013Osh road and Som25 million for the rest of the \nnetwork). Over the years the supplementary budget has varied while the original budget has \nremained relatively consistent. \n \n11.  The average annual road maintenance expenditure for the MOTC network is $375/km, \nwith funds highly skewed toward the Bishkek\u2013Osh road. This amount is far lower than the \nusually  quoted  figure  of  $2,000  per  km  to  adequately  maintain  a  stabilized  road  network. \nMoreover, only 20% of the maintenance work is routine maintenance, that average being at a \nvery low $60 per km for the network. It is said that in some cases roads have deteriorated so \nmuch that the size of the potholes no longer permits ordinary routine maintenance and major \nrepair maintenance is needed. \n \n ", "    Appendix 2       35     \n \nF.  Road Maintenance \n \n12.  The Kyrgyz Republic, in its draft road sector strategy paper, reported an alarming loss of \nabout 1,000 km of asphalt-surfaced roads over the last 5 years and identified that it needs over $1 \nbillion to rehabilitate its 2,242 km long major road corridors and annual maintenance funding of \n$48 million over the next 5 years to bring the devastated road network into more stable and \nmaintainable condition. The National Poverty Strategy for 2006 identified the poor condition of the \nroads as a major constraint to the country\u2019s economic and social development. It quotes recent \ndetailed studies of the country\u2019s principal roads that found that two thirds of their length was in \ndistressed condition. Past neglect of road network maintenance means that little can now be done \nto prevent the loss of a large part of the present asphalt surfacing. Without rapid and carefully \nfocused interventions, this and even more serious degradation is inevitable. Road user costs \n(manifest in higher consumption of fuel, spare parts, vehicle depreciation, time loss, and accident \ncosts) will increase many times more than the cost of the road maintenance that has been \nneglected. Furthermore, unchecked deterioration of the road network will have serious impacts \nbeyond those that can be measured within the transport sector itself. Kyrgyz centers of industry \nand  commerce  will  be  isolated  and  lose  competitiveness  versus  regional  trading  partners. \nDispersed population groups within the Republic\u2019s borders will become further disconnected from \nurban  markets,  social  services,  and  opportunities  to  study  and  work  abroad.  The  country\u2019s \nimmense tourism potential will remain largely unexploited. These and other lost opportunities will \nthwart national programs for poverty alleviation. The National Poverty Strategy concludes that to \nfully achieve its policy objectives of assuring connectivity and access along the network corridors, \nthe MOTC will need to focus its available resources on preservation, through maintenance, of the \ncore network until the condition is stabilized. \n \n13.  Almost all routine and periodic maintenance is undertaken by MOTC depots (DEP). The \nDEPs have limited autonomy in deciding how to allocate the resources that are actually made \navailable to them from the MOTC. Salaries are paid directly by the MOTC. DEPs complain that \nthey have insufficient money to undertake maintenance work, and thus their staff and equipment \nare underutilized. The Government has accepted recommendations of previous TA that call for \nincreased private sector involvement in road maintenance, but, because little work is currently \ncontracted, no viable contracting industry exists. When contracts are let, payment is often \ndelayed.  A  step-by-step  approach  to  privatization  has  been  proposed.  The  Government \nproposes that the DEPs be commercialized as a first step. Based on experience in Kazakhstan, \nMOTC  believes  that  immediate  commercialization  may  result  in  loss  of  road  maintenance \nservice  providers  and  the  sale  of  existing  equipment.  Such  experience  led  Kazakhstan  to \nreintroduce a DEP system. Thus, although privatization and commercialization are accepted in \nprinciple, there has been little or no attempt to implement such a policy. \n \n14.  In 2004, the Government and ADB have agreed on an action plan for developing and \nimplementing a strategy to ensure adequate road maintenance. A new methodology for road \nmaintenance is currently being developed under TA 4705-KGZ, TA 4444-KGZ, and the current \nproject. \n  \n ", "36  Appendix 3 \nEXTERNAL ASSISTANCE TO THE ROAD SUBSECTOR \n(REGIONAL PROJECTS IN TAJIKISTAN AND THE KYRGYZ REPUBLIC) \nLoan/TA/ Project  Project Name  Loan/TA Amount  Date \nNumber  ($ million)  Approved \nA.

General \n \n1.  The Project is designed to promote sustainable economic development and regional \ncooperation through direct investment in transport and customs to improve regional connectivity \nand thereby reduce high transport costs.1 The Project will address transport cost reduction by \nrehabilitating a major regional corridor connecting the Kyrgyz Republic and Tajikistan. The \nProject will improve 121 kilometer (km) of national corridor in Tajikistan and 142 km of main \nroad in the Kyrgyz Republic. The project road is divided into seven sections. Four sections fall \nunder the Tajikistan components. These are Section A: Nimchi\u2013Sayron (km 217\u2013248), Section \nB: Sayron\u2013Jirgatal (km 248\u2013273), Section C: Jirgatal\u2013Dumbrachi (km 273\u2013298), and Section D: \nDumbrachi\u2013Karamik (km 298\u2013337). Kyrgyz components include three sections covering Section \nE: Sary Tash\u2013Sari Mogol (km 0\u201330), Section F: Sari Mogol\u2013Doroot Korgon (km 30\u201397), and (iii) \nSection G: Doroot Korgon\u2013Tajik Border (km 97\u2013142). \n \n2.  The economic analysis examined the expected contribution of the project road to the \ncountry and region based on a with- and without-project comparison in accordance with Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) guidelines.2 The analysis covers the period 2008\u20132031, comprising 3 \nyears of construction and 20 years of operation, expressed in constant beginning-2007 US \ndollar prices. \n \nB.

The share of transport \ncosts in the value of imports is estimated to be around 10% in both countries according to Faye et al (2004), Ojala, \nL., Naula, T. and Queiroz, C., (2004) and ADB estimates. \n2  ADB. 1997. Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects.. Manila. \n ", "52  Appendix 9 \n \n4.  Existing Traffic. Seasonally adjusted base year traffic counts3 were conducted for each \nsection of the project road and used in the traffic forecast analysis and economic assessments. \nExisting  data  on  historical  traffic  counts  by  the  respective  ministries  of  transport  and \ncommunications were reviewed to determine appropriate base year traffic. The existing traffic is \nrelatively low in Tajikistan with the traffic count ranging from 395 vehicles per day on the \nsouthwestern-most link (Nimich\u2013Sayron) to 150 vehicles daily on the northeastern-most link \n(Dumbrachi\u2013Karamik), and the distance-weighted average traffic volume is estimated at 247 \nvehicle per day. The Kyrgyz Republic\u2019s recent traffic counts on the project road shows that it \naverages around 100 vehicles daily between Sary Tash and Daroot Korgon and about 50 \nvehicle between Daroot Korgon and the Tajik border and that this traffic is predominantly local.  \n \n5.  Traffic Forecast. The traffic forecasts are based on expected growth in gross domestic \nproduct  (GDP),  income  elasticities  of  demand,  and  analysis  of  regional  trade  patterns. \nAdditional assumptions include (i) political stability and strong macroeconomic performance in \nthe Kyrgyz Republic and Tajikistan; (ii) continued commitment of Kyrgyz Republic, People\u2019s \nRepublic  of  China  (PRC),  and  Tajikistan  governments  to  regional  cooperation;  and  (iii) \nsustainable  external  assistance  to  the  road  subsector  and  completion  of  interlinking  road \nprojects. Expected construction of coal mines in both countries and of the Rogun dam and \nhydropower station in Tajikistan along the Corridor were assumed to generate additional traffic. \n \n6.  Total traffic is expected to grow at an average 8.3% rate for all vehicle types. Generated \ntraffic has been estimated at 20% of normal traffic and with the same growth rate as normal \ntraffic. In the analysis, generated traffic accounts for 30% of total and transit traffic.  \n \n7.  International traffic is minimal at present but it is expected to grow once the entire \nCorridor is improved. The international generated traffic forecast is based on analysis of trade \npatterns in the region. Four freight traffic projections were examined based on a similar analysis \nunder the Phase II road project in Tajikistan: (i) Tajikistan-Kyrgyz Republic trade, (ii) Tajikistan-\nPRC trade, (iii) Afghanistan-PRC trade, and (iv) vehicle imports from the PRC. This traffic is \nprojected to grow from the current less than 10 to over 1,000 vehicles per day by the end of the \nanalysis period (to 50% of the total traffic). More than half of that will be heavy commercial \nvehicles. About 34% of this projected international traffic will be destined to or originate from \nTajikistan, 4% to or from the Kyrgyz Republic, and 66% to or from Afghanistan. Improving the \nregional road network, for which the project road sections presently constitute major bottlenecks, \nwill provide a much more direct and efficient transport route for trade between these country \npairs and will greatly facilitate trade. The traffic forecast is summarized in Table A9.5. \n \nC.  Economic Costs \n8.  Construction Costs. The economic costs were estimated based on the financial cost of \nthe capital expenditures, including physical contingencies. Price contingencies, interest during \nconstruction, and taxes and duties were excluded. Using a world price numeraire, nontradable \ncosts were converted from financial to economic costs by applying a standard conversion factor \nof 0.85 for both countries. \n \n                                                 \n3  Project preparation technical assistance consultants financed by ADB conducted traffic counts in both countries \n(November 2006), and consultants financed by European Commission conducted traffic counts (June 2007) on the \nproject road in the Kyrgyz Republic. \n ", "  Appendix 9  53 \n9.  Road  Maintenance  Costs.  It  was  assumed  that  the  existing  gravel  and/or  earth \nsurfaces would require annual routine maintenance and re-graveling at regular intervals. The \npaved road sections in the \u201cwith\u201d project would require resealing with a single bituminous layer \nevery 5\u20137 years. The economic maintenance costs were based on unit rates derived from \nongoing operations and estimated quantities. Financial analysis further examined the project \nimpact  on  the  financial  status  of  the  Ministry  of  Transport  and  Communications  and  the \nGovernment, particularly the financial impact of the maintenance and operational costs from the \nProject. Road agency costs are represented by recurrent maintenance costs of $0.2 million \nannually for each the Tajikistan and Kyrgyz Republic components and the cost of periodic \nmaintenance at $52,000 per km in 2017 and 2024.  \n \nTable A9.2: Maintenance Costs \nFirst         Second  Third   Subsequent \n Item  Intervention  Intervention  Intervention  Interventions \nDescription  Asphaltic  Sprayed seal  Asphaltic concrete  Sprayed seal \nconcrete \nYear or interval  2017  2024  2029  5 years \nCost, $\u2019000/km   52.0  16.1  52.0  16.1 \nSources: Asian Development Bank project preparatory technical assistance consultant\u2019s estimates. \n \n10.

The key quantifiable benefits include (i) reduced road user costs4 to normal traffic and \nadditional  traffic  from  coal  mines  and  the  hydroelectric  project,  (ii)  increased  producer  and \nconsumer surplus accruing to generated domestic traffic, (iii) benefits to generated and diverted \ninternational transit traffic, and (iv) increased agricultural production and incomes in Tajikistan.   \n                                                 \n4  Road user costs include vehicle operating costs, the value of passenger time and the freight transit time. \n ", "54  Appendix 9 \n \n12.  Distribution Analysis. The distribution of the Project\u2019s benefits among countries in the \nregion was examined. The benefits are distributed primarily among four countries, as follows: \nTajikistan5 (70%), PRC (9.3%), Kyrgyz Republic (20.5%), and Afghanistan (0.2%). Tajikistan\u2019s \nshare of international benefits would be 42% and Kyrgyz Republic\u2019s 38%. \n \n13.  The  project  benefits  accruing  to  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  and  Tajikistan  are  distributed \namong six groups: (i) users of freight transport, (ii) users of passenger transport, (iii) vehicle \nowners, (iv) skilled and unskilled labor, (v) agricultural households,6 and (vi) the Government \nand/or economy. The distribution of benefits is illustrated in Table A9.8. \n \nE.  Economic Internal Rate of Return and Sensitivity Analyses \n14.  The Project is economically viable, with an estimated economic internal rate of return \n(EIRR) of 18.1% at a 12% discount rate. EIRR without international traffic is estimated at 8.0%. \nMost of the benefits accrue to international traffic (54%), followed by savings in road user costs \n(27%), benefits to agricultural production in Tajikistan (17%), and generated traffic benefits (2%).  \n \n15.  The sensitivity analysis assesses the variables to which the Project\u2019s estimated EIRR \nand net present value are sensitive. The EIRR\u2019s sensitivity to the effects of possible unfavorable \nscenarios related to changes in key parameters indicated that the combined Project would \nmaintain its economic viability, with an EIRR of 12.0%, even under the adverse scenario.

No \n \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in the Kyrgyz Republic and Tajikistan: \nThe Project is in line with both governments\u2019 agendas for poverty reduction, as indicated in their respective national \npoverty reduction strategies and ADB\u2019s country partnership strategies. Both ADB and the governments recognize the \nimportance of regional cooperation to the landlocked Kyrgyz Republic and Tajikistan, with trade, transport, and energy \nbeing the priority areas for socioeconomic development. The strategies support the governments\u2019 approach to \nreducing poverty and reaching their Millennium Development Goals by balancing social goals with the need to \nstimulate growth through improving market access to rapidly growing neighboring markets and investing in agriculture \nto create economic opportunities in rural areas where most of the poor reside. The Project directly supports one of the \ngoals in the country partnership strategies, which is to improve trade and road linkages with regional markets. \n  \nAlthough the Project does not directly target poverty reduction, it has indirect benefits for the poor through increased \nmobility and accessibility to markets and social services in the project area; lower transport costs for inputs and \nproducts;  better  access  to  and  interaction  with  other  regions;  and  employment  opportunities  during  and  after \nconstruction owing to increased coal mining, urbanization, and other economic activities. Overall, connectivity will \nboost local employment and income, as it increases transborder trade and transportation as well as tourism. Farmers \nwill obtain access to transportation for their fruits and vegetables to markets internally (primarily to Dushanbe and \nOsh) and externally (Kazakhstan and Russia). \nB.  Poverty Analysis   Targeting Classification: General intervention \n \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?  \nThe Project is not a targeted poverty intervention. Its goal is to foster regional cooperation through providing \nimprovements to sections of the regional road corridor and thereby supporting economic activities and addressing key \nissues related to poverty in rural areas. The Project will indirectly benefit (i) about 228,000 people from three \ncommunities  in  Tajikistan,  among  whom  some  100,800,  or  44%,  are  poor;  and  (ii)  29,143  people  from  two \ncommunities in the Kyrgyz Republic, of whom 52% are poor. A further quarter of beneficiaries are considered just \nabove the poverty line. Poverty levels in the project area are higher than respective national averages, which are at \n43% for both countries. The overall poverty level in the project area will be monitored through socioeconomic surveys \nduring the project implementation and after completion and reported in the Project\u2019s progress and completion reports.   \nC.  Participation Process \n \nIs there a stakeholder analysis?    Yes     No  \nDuring  preparation  of  Stakeholders  Participation  Analysis,  representatives  of  the  ministries  of  transport  and \ncommunications and project preparatory technical assistance teams undertook socioeconomic surveys and public \nmeetings at village, jomoat (village cluster), and/or rayon (district) levels. These surveys and meetings raised \nawareness and gained local support. There were extensive consultations with the local community at Tajikabad in \nselecting the final road alignment on Tajikistan\u2019s portion of the Corridor, and due consideration was given to technical, \nenvironmental, social, resettlement, and economic impacts of the selected road alignment. Consultations will continue \nthroughout the project implementation to address implementation-related concerns and issues.  \n \nIs there a participation strategy?     Yes                   No \nOngoing ADB-financed projects in both the Kyrgyz Republic and Tajikistan employ about 300 local unskilled labor and \n100 skilled labor. For maximizing the Project\u2019s benefits to the local communities, the contractors will be encouraged to \nuse local laborers, including women, to the maximum extent. \nD.  Gender Development \n \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \nOverall, female household heads account for about 10% of beneficiary households in the project area. The distribution \nof male- and female-headed households across the income groups is very similar, and there are no significant \ndifferences that merit project-specific gender actions based on poverty rates. The poverty and social assessment \n ", "58  Appendix 10 \nconcluded that women will be beneficiaries of the Project and that the Project has the potential to create gender \nspecific outcomes as a result of more general social benefits that could derive from improved and maintained road \naccess and enhancing women\u2019s participation in the productive sector. While women stand to benefit from these \nsubprojects, they also are likely to experience potential adverse social impacts, including increased exposure to \ncommunicable diseases. This risk will be mitigated through the HIV/AIDS/STDs and human trafficking awareness and \nprevention campaign to be implemented by the Project. Gender specific parameters have been included in the social \nimpact monitoring plan to ensure that women fully participate in and enjoy project benefits. \n \nHas an output been prepared?

Introduction and Background \n1.  The Republic of Tajikistan has requested $46 million in loan and grant from the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) to undertake the Regional Road Corridor Improvement \nProject involving rehabilitation of the Dushanbe\u2013Kyrgyz border road. This section of road \nis some 121 kilometers (km) long and takes in km 217 to km 337 of the existing road in \nTajikistan. The project objective is to rehabilitate and selectively widen the road within the \nlimits of the existing right-of-way (ROW). It will entail very limited land acquisition and \nresettlement (LAR). No impact on indigenous peoples is envisaged.  \n \n2.  In order to plan the compensation and rehabilitation of the few families affected \nby  the  Project,  a  short  resettlement  plan  (SRP)1 was  prepared  by  the  Ministry  of \nTransport and Communication (MOTC), the Executing Agency. The SRP is, so far, \nbased  on  advanced  preliminary  design  and  therefore  will  need  updating  before  its \nimplementation.  The  document\u2019s  objective  is  to  detail  an  effective  action  plan  to \ncompensate  the  affected  persons  based  on  sound  planning  principles  and  the \nrequirements of Tajikistan laws and the ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy. The \ndocument  is  based  on  intensive  stakeholder  consultation,  a  detailed  impacts \nassessment and affected persons survey, and a preliminary valuation of the affected \nassets at replacement cost. \n \n3.  Based  on  ADB  practice  the  SRP  established  the  following  LAR-related \nconditionalities to project implementation: \n(i)  Approval of contract award. Updated SRP based on a fixed corridor, \nfinal definition of compensation rates, and a detailed plan for preparation \nof the needed replacement plots. \n(ii)  ADB approval of civil works mobilization in the field. Full implementation \nof the compensation and rehabilitation detailed in the final resettlement plan, \nincluding  delivery  of  compensation  to  the  affected  persons,  will  be  a \ncondition of ADB approval of civil works mobilization in the field. \n \nB.  Specific Land Acquisition and Resettlement Impacts \n4.  The Project will affect 27 families (228 persons). The 27 plots affected are small \nparcels of land occupied by the affected households\u2019 premises and by sheds which are \nencroaching  into  the  road  corridor.  In  all,  these  land-use  impacts  amount  to  1,843 \nsquare meters (m2). Seven houses are affected for a total of 839 m2. Twenty-four sheds \nare affected are a total of 1,004 m2. All houses but two are mildly affected and, based on \nthe choices of their owners, will not be relocated. The trees affected include 62 poplars \nand willows. \n \nC.  Resettlement Framework \n5.  The SRP is based on the following principles: (i) LAR will be avoided or at least \nminimized, (ii) compensation will ensure maintenance of the affected persons\u2019 pre-project \n                                                 \n1  Based on the benchmark for impact significance, and given the number of affected persons and types of \nimpacts they suffer, this Project will not cause severe losses. Therefore, only a short resettlement plan \nwas prepared. \n ", "60  Appendix 11 \nliving standards, (iii) affected persons will be fully informed and consulted on compensation \noptions, (iv) affected persons\u2019 sociocultural institutions will be supported and used, (v) LAR \nprovisions will apply equally to both genders, (vi) lack of formal title will not be a bar to \ncompensation and/or rehabilitation, (vii) particular attention will be paid to female-headed \nhouseholds and vulnerable groups, (viii) LAR will be conceived and executed as an integral \npart of the Project and LAR budgets will be included in project costs, and (ix) compensation \nwill be fully provided prior to ground leveling and demolition. The SRP also covers all issues \nrelevant for the effective conduct of LAR tasks so as to fit ADB policy (see next paragraphs) \nand sets the following eligibility and entitlement provisions:  \n \nTable A11: Resettlement Entitlement Matrix \nLoss Type  Application Affected  No of  Entitlement  Implementation Issues \nFamily  Affected \nFamilies \nLand use   Loss of  Building  28  - Cash rehabilitation based  Based  on  consultation  with \nbuilding  owner  householdson land market rate  affected  persons,  26  mildly \npremises  - provision of new plot    affected  households  chose  cash \npartly  compensation  while  2  severely \nencroaching  affected  households  want  to  be \ninto right-of- relocated and receive replacement \nway  plots.

Institutional Responsibilities. The Government of Tajikistan will bear the costs \nof  all  resettlement  activities  related  to  the  Project.  The  MOTC  will  assume  overall \n ", "    Appendix 11       61     \nresponsibility for implementing resettlement according to the approved SRP. The project \nimplementation unit within MOTC will assign one officer in charge of resettlement and \nwill be directly responsible to coordinate the planning, implementation, financing, and \nreporting of resettlement for the Project. The local governments, namely the Tajikabad \nRayon (District) and its three jomoat (village cluster) governments, will take the primary \nresponsibility  for  land  administration,  valuation,  and  acquisition  and  will  be  directly \ninvolved in stakeholder consultation, LAR implementation, and timely entitlement. \n \n7.  Disclosure and Public Consultation. The 2004 Land Code requires disclosure \nand consultation with affected persons. The affected persons have been notified about \nthe key elements of the SRP during meetings and interviews. Prior to implementation, \nthere  will  be  further  consultations  arranged  by  local  authorities  to  discuss  specific \nimpacts  in  each  household  and  the  resettlement  scope,  expected  time  frame, \ncompensation rates for assets, other assistance to replace assets, relocation, and the \ngrievance redress mechanisms. The local authority will ensure that any concerns raised \nby the affected persons are quickly addressed. As an appraisal condition, the SRP in \nEnglish will be disclosed on the ADB website while the SRP in Tajik will be disclosed in \nthe affected persons\u2019 communities. \n \n8.  Complaints  and  Grievances.  In  case  of  grievance,  all  complaints  will  be \nprocessed  based  on  Article  47,  Chapter  7  of  the  Land  Code  of  Tajikistan  (2004). \nAffected  people  will  submit  their  oral  or  written  complaints  first  to  the  local  land \ncommittees. If their complaints are not settled satisfactorily, they can appeal in court. \n \n9.  Finance and Implementation Schedule. The total budget is about $129,000, \nincluding all costs for compensation, subsidy, allowance, administration, and monitoring \nand evaluation. MOTC will guarantee to supplement the resettlement budget, as may \nprove necessary, to meet any shortfall which emerges in achieving the resettlement \nobjectives. The resettlement implementation schedule has been prepared in accordance \nwith the Project\u2019s construction timetable agreed by MOTC and ADB. \n \n10.  Monitoring Arrangements. Due to the minor impacts that the Project has on \nhouseholds, simple process monitoring will be carried out to check that households are \ncompensated sufficiently and in a timely manner. Internal monitoring and evaluation will \nbe undertaken by the project implementation unit and reported to ADB through quarterly \nprogress reports. A budget of TJS53,280 ($15,500) was allocated for internal monitoring. \nExternal  monitoring  will  be  carried  out  by  international  and/or  national  construction \nsupervision  consultants  under  the  project  performance  management  system.  Both \ndomestic and external monitoring and evaluation will be integrated with Phase II. \n \n "], "metadata": {"CreationDate": "D:20071004102037+08'00'", "Creator": "PScript5.dll Version 5.2", "Producer": "Acrobat Elements 7.0.5 (Windows)", "ModDate": "D:20081027104755+08'00'", "Title": "CAREC Regional Road Corridor Improvement Project (KGZ)"}, "author_page": " \n \nVice President  L.
