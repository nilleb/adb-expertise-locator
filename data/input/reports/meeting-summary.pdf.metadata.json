The meeting was co-hosted by Thailand ABMF members (Thailand \nBond  Market  Association  (ThaiBMA),  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission  (SEC),  and  The \nStock Exchange of Thailand), Ministry of Finance, Thailand, Bank of Thailand and ADB. More \nthan 140 national, regional, and global experts from the public and private sectors gathered at \nthe  meeting.  The  main  purpose  of  the  meeting  was  i)  to  discuss  key  characteristics  of  the \nproposed regionally standardized bond issuance program, Asian Multi-currency Bond Issuance \nFramework (AMBIF), and ii) review the identified bond transaction flows, preliminary findings of \nthe  fit  and  gap  analysis,  and  policy  recommendations  to  enhance  STP  in  the  region.  The \nmeeting agenda and participants list are in Attachments 1 and 2, respectively. \n\n2. \nThe  regulatory  bodies  of  ASEAN+3  were  invited  to  the  meeting  to  share  in  the  key \ninformation  on  developing  AMBIF.    It  was  the  2nd  invitation  following  the  1st  one  to  the  Seoul \nABMF meeting on 4 Sep 2012. In addition to their participation in the main ABMF meetings, the \nregulatory  bodies  had  a  separate  session  on  22  Nov  2012,  from  16:30  to  18:30,  to  further \ndiscuss  the  details  of  AMBIF.  Chaired  by  Asian  Bond  Market  Initiative  (ABMI)  Task  Force  3 \n(TF3) chair and co-chair (Japan and Malaysia), regulatory bodies from 9 economies and ADB\u2019s \nABMF secretariat team (the secretariat) attended the session. \n\nOn the sideline of ABMF meetings, the 3rd ASEAN+3 Self Regulatory Organization (SRO) \n3. \nWorking  Group  Meeting  was  held  on  20  Nov  2012  hosted  by  ThaiBMA  and  PDS  Holdings, \nPhilippines. In the meeting, the SROs from seven economies exchanged information on the role \nand  function  of  each  organization  and  the  views  on  feasible  topics  for  future  discussion.  To \nfurther  clarify  the  topics  for  future  activities,  they  agreed  to  have  a  workshop,  possibly  on  the \nsideline of the next ABMF meeting.  \n\n4. \nIn  addition,  a  signing  ceremony  was  held  for  a  coalition  on  information  sharing  among \nthe  ThaiBMA,  Indonesian  Bond  Pricing  Agency,  and  Bond  Pricing  Agency  Malaysia.  The \ncoalition  among  the  three  institutions  was  welcomed  by  ABMF  members  as  an  example  of \nactual  progress  made  in  the  region  for  more  efficient  information  sharing,  and  some  ABMF \nmembers participated in the event. (Details of the information sharing scheme are in Attachment \n3)    \n\nII. \n\nKEY DISCUSSION RESULTS (Meeting minutes will be provided later) \n\n(SF1: Discussion on AMBIF) \n\nThe  secretariat  (Prof.  Inukai  and  Mr.  Schmidt)  presented  a  detailed  concept  of  AMBIF \n5. \nincluding the basic approaches, key characteristics such as professional investor, professional \nmarkets, documentation, and issuers, and methodologies for actual implementation (Attachment \n4).    Through  the  presentation,  it  is  highlighted  that  i)  a  \u201cprinciple  based\u201d  (PB)  approach  is \nrecommended, meaning that specific details could be decided by the market participants based \non  mutually  agreed  core  principles,  ii)  mutual  recognition  among  the  regulatory  bodies  are \nrequired  on  the  key  characteristics  of  AMBIF  including  normalization  of  approval  process,  iii)  \n\n \n\n1 \n\n\fthat a proxy approach is desired relative to approvals to create a key benefit for issuers, and iv) \nfurther  discussion  by  the  members  is  needed  on  the  proposed  key  characteristics  of  AMBIF. \nMembers  appreciated  the  hard  work  done  by  the  secretariat  and  discussed  various  points, \nincluding the following: \n\n\u2022  A  representative  from  Korea  Financial  Investment  Association  (KOFIA)  argued  that  PB \napproach alone might not be appropriate for Asia because of the institutional diversities of \nfinancial  system  in  this  region.  Therefore,  together  with  the  PB  approach,  which  basically \nfollows the regulation style of the United Kingdom (UK), RB1 approach as in US regulations \nalso  needs  to  be  considered  for  ASEAN  +  3  countries  to  make  appropriate  regulatory \nchoices  according  to  each  own  financial  situation.  The  secretariat  opined  that  PB  and  RB \napproaches are not mutually exclusive because behind all the rules there are principles. The \nPB  approach  is  suggested  considering  that  it  could  make  regulatory  bodies  feel  more \ncomfortable in their discussion for mutual recognition, but both approaches could be applied \nin future discussions, depending on the regulatory bodies\u2019 comfort level. \n\n\u2022  A representative from Tokyo Stock Exchange pointed out the need to clarify legal aspects of \nAMBIF  for  the  purpose  of  consumer  protection,  to  which  the  secretariat  fully  agreed  and \ncommitted continued study. \n\nincreased  cross  border  capital \n\n\u2022  A  representative  from  People\u2019s  Bank  of  China  opined  that  i)  AMBIF  could  influence \nmacroeconomic  management  with \nflows  and  such \nmacroeconomic aspects should be reviewed, ii) the key concepts such as investors, eligible \nbonds should be clearly defined, and iii) some information on the Chinese market should be \nrevised.  The  secretariat  agreed  on  the  points,  and  added  that  AMBIF  could  contribute  to \nmore balanced growth and stable macroeconomic environment by deepening local currency \nbond  markets,  although  the  AMBIF  discussion  is  not  directly  related  to  macroeconomic \nissues.    ABMF  will  be  ready  to  address  macroeconomic  concern  of  ASEAN+3  policy \nauthorities, if any specific advice is given.     \n\n\u2022  One international expert raised question on how to build the supply side of AMBIF, including \nthe  channeling  of  key  information  to  potential  issuers.  The  secretariat  replied  that  market \nassociations and SROs are assumed to perform a key role in distributing AMBIF information \nto the market.  \n\n\u2022  Several  participants,  including  the  Assistant  Governor  of  the  Bank  of  Thailand,  raised \nquestions  and  added  comments  on  the  approaches,  concepts  and  targeted  outputs  of \nAMBIF. In sum, the secretariat explained that AMBIF is aiming to make it possible for bond \nissuers  to  issue  bonds  in  any  participation  locations  (without  requiring  physical  presence) \nwith  one  standardized  documentation,  and  for  mutually  agreed  professional  investors \n(AMBIF  investors)  to  sell  and  buy  the  issued  bonds  without  selling  restrictions  among \nthemselves.  To  achieve  the  goal,  mutual  recognition  is  proposed  in  either  a  multilateral  or \nmultiple of bilateral format, using a step-by-step approach. As for the question raised by a \nrepresentative  from  the  Malaysian  Investment  Banking  Association  on  whether  AMBIF  will \nallow foreign currency denominated bond issuance by non-residents, the secretariat clarified \nthat this would be determined by regulatory bodies in each economy.       \n\n                                                 \n1 It  is  generally  understood  that  a  \"rule-based  approach\"  is  the  way  that  sets  detailed  binding  parameters  to  be \napplied  to  individual  cases,  requiring  participants  in  a  market  must  operate  within  the  parameters.  On  the  other \nhand,  a  \u201cprinciple  base  approach\u201d  means  the  way  that  encourages  voluntary  efforts  of  the  market  participants  to \noperate within generally agreed principles; such principles are typically applied in more generic terms than specific \nrules \n\n \n\n \n\n2 \n\n\f\u2022  The  secretariat  expressed  sincere  appreciation  to  members  for  their  support  in  preparing \nAMBIF proposal and additional comments during the meeting. Based on the points raised by \nthe members, the secretariat will further refine the concept of AMBIF and report it to the next \nABMF meeting.  \n\nIn  relation  to  the  AMBIF  discussion,  there  were  information  sharing  sessions  on  i)  the \n\n6. \nmethods for mutual recognition, and ii) the experience of ASEAN Capital Market Forum (ACMF):  \nRepresentatives  from  ASIFMA  presented  to  the  members  the  concept  of  \u2018mutual  recognition\u2019   \nand  \u2018mutual  agreement\u2019  -  the  former  requires  changes  in  regulation  while  the  latter  could  be \nachieved without changes in regulation - together with specific experiences in both concepts. It \nis understood that AMBIF will require mutual recognition on key characteristics, although mutual \nagreement on the sideline issues could add benefits to AMBIF. A representative from Thailand \nSEC presented the progress in ACMF focusing on bond market harmonization.  It is shared with \nthe  members  that  AMBIF  is  different  from  ACMF  initiatives  in  that  i)  ACMF  does  not  directly \nfocus  on  professional  investors,  and  ii)  mutual  recognition  on  the  concept  of  professional \ninvestors and documentation is not included in ACMF.  \n\n (SF2: Identification of bond transaction flows) \n\nThe secretariat (Dr. Inui and Mr. Kawai) presented to the members i) updated DVP flows \n7. \nof  corporate  bonds,  and  the  flows  for  interest  payment  and  redemption  of  each  economy,  ii) \npreliminary  findings  of  the  fit  and  gap  (F&G)  analysis  on  the  transaction  flows  and  message \nitems, and ii) draft policy recommendations to enhance STP in the region. \n\n8. \nSome  of  the  National  Members  (NMs)  including  those  from  PRC,  Thailand,  Indonesia, \nand Malaysia provided additional comments on the presented information and flow diagrams for \ntheir  respective  economies  and  some  International  Experts  (IEs)  also  offered  feedback.  The \nsecretariat expressed sincere thanks for the support from the members in identifying the flows \nand  additional  comments.  All  the  comments  were  well  noted  by  the  secretariat  and  would  be \nreflected appropriately. \n\nIt  was  the  first  time  that  preliminary  findings  of  the  F&G  analysis  were  shared  with  the \n9. \nmembers, and the secretariat requested careful review of the details of the findings, which will \nbe the basis for policy recommendations. One IE pointed out that the F&G analysis on message \nitems  utilizing  only  10  common  elements  for  a  settlement  instruction  is  not  enough  to  see  the \nwhole process. The secretariat explained that the current analysis, which is focusing only on 10 \nelements due to resource limitation, is to check what can be found through the analysis and it \ncould be expanded in the future to include more items. \n\n As for policy recommendations and roadmap, various points have been actively raised \n\n10. \nby many IEs and some NMs, including the following: \n\n\u2022  The secretariat proposed to include discussion on CCP as one policy recommendation. An \nIE  (from  Clearstream)  opined  that  it  should  be  decided  through  further  discussion  under \ncurrent  situation  in  the  region  where  most  economies  are  not  yet  having  a  CCP  in  bond \ntransactions, although recent regulation changes such as Basel III and the Dobb-Frank Act \nrequire serious consideration of it. Another IE (from J.P. Morgan) sought clarification of the \nconcept  of  CCP,  whether  just  as  a  central  point  of  trade  capture,  trade  reporting  and  net \ncalculation of positions for settlement or as a central counterparty assuming the credit risk of \n\n \n\n3 \n\n\ftrading parties. If the latter, he added that the industry had strong reservations since there \nare additional risk and liquidity considerations to be made in that regard. \n\n\u2022  The  study  on  cross-border  collateral  (CBC),  which  was  suggested  as  one  of  the  policy \nrecommendations, has been heavily discussed among the members. In general, most of the \nmembers  agreed  on  the  importance  of  the  issue  of  CBC.  Members  from  Japan  and \nClearstream  argued  that  a  priority  might  be  given  to  CBC  rather  than  other  policy \nrecommendations. A NM from Hong Kong introduced on-going efforts to enhance CBC. An \nIE  from  The  Bank  of  Tokyo  Mitsubishi  UFJ  mentioned  bilateral  efforts  for  CBC  by  Bank  of \nJapan  and  Bank  of  Thailand  and  pointed  out  there  is  a  need  for  further  improvement \nincluding  the  shortening  timing  for  getting  liquidity,  which  currently  requires  7  days.  The \nsecretariat  agreed  on  the  potential  importance  of  CBC  as  future  agenda  of  ABMF,  and \nadded that several options and models for CBC could be explored on a non-obligation basis, \nsubject to the members\u2019 discussion.   \n\n\u2022  Other  comments  were  also  provided  including  re-organizing  the  policy  recommendations \nwith priorities, revising inaccurate descriptions to avoid unnecessary confusion, and utilizing \nnational  market  practice  groups  (NMPG)  for  the  standardizing  of  transaction  flows.  The \nsecretariat thanked all the members for the valuable comments, requested continued review \non the key findings of SF2 materials, and committed to refining the recommendations for the \ndiscussion during the next ABMF meeting.  \n\n \n11. \nIn  relation  to  the  SF2  discussion,  information  on  the  Regional  Settlement  Intermediary \n(RSI)  has  been  shared  through  a  presentation  by  an  ADB  consultant  for  the  RSI  study.    He \nexplained  to  the  members  about  a  new  business  feasibility  study  on  RSI  which  is  currently  in \nprogress and would be finalized by the end of this year.  \n\n(Other issues) \n\n12. \nThe secretariat reported to members i) the result of the ABMI TF3 meeting in Kunming \non 17 Oct 2012, ii) progress in knowledge support for Brunei Darussalam, Cambodia, Lao PDR, \nMyanmar, and Vietnam, and iii) on the ABMF public conference at Sibos on 31 Oct 2012. A plan \nfor updating Phase 1 reports was also introduced to members by SWIFT, acting as secretariat \nof the ad-hoc updating team.   \n\n13. \nThe work plan after the meeting has been shared with the members as in Table 1. The \nnext ABMF meeting will be held in Singapore on 5-6 February 2013. Key components of AMBIF \nand draft policy recommendations to enhance STP will be further refined and presented by the \nsecretariat for members\u2019 discussion. \n\n14.  Mr. Shunzo Kayanuma from Tokyo Stock Exchange took over the chairmanship of SF1 \nfrom Mr. Tetsutaro Muraki and chaired the SF1 meeting on 21 Nov 2012.   \n\nAll presentation materials during the meeting have been made available at the Members \n\n15. \nLibrary section of the ABMF website (http://asean3abmf.adb.org). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n4 \n\n \n\n\fTable 1: Work Plan after Seoul meeting \n\n21-22 Nov 2012  10th ABMF Meeting in Bangkok \n6-7 Dec 2012 \n5-6 Feb 2013 \nQ1~Q2 2013 \nMar 2013 \nApr 2013 \nApr 2013 \nMay 2013 \nQ2~ 2013 \n\nBCLM Knowledge support - kick-off seminar \n11th ABMF meeting in Singapore \nBCLM knowledge support \u2013 market visits \nABMI TF3 meeting (4th reporting of Phase 2) \n12th ABMF meeting \nSubmitting the report to ASEAN+3 Deputies meeting \nRecommendations approved by ASEAN+3 Ministers \nBCLM knowledge support \u2013 additional support/follow-up \nFollowing up on the implementation of recommendations \nFinalize Phase 2 full report \n\n2nd Half 2013 \n\nPilot issue (tentative) \n\n \n \n \n \nAttachments:  1. 10th ABMF meeting agenda \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n2. 10th ABMF meeting participants list \n3.

Paying Agent (PA) of bond issuer for interest payment and redemption\n\n(cid:190) Regarding government bonds, central banks are PA of the issuer (MOF) in 7 \n\neconomies (HK, ID, JP, KR, MY, SG, and TH) out of 10 economies which have \nbond markets in ASEAN+3. CSDs are the PA in two economies (CN and VN).  \nGovernment (Bureau to Treasury) is the PA in PH.\n\n(cid:190) Regarding corporate bonds,  commercial banks are PA of issuers in 6 economies \n(HK, JP, KR, MY, PH, and SG). CSDs are PA in 3 economies (CN, ID, and VN). \nCentral bank is PA in TH.\n\n2. Account Management Agent (AMA) of bond holder (investor) for interest payment and \n\nredemption\n(cid:190) Regarding government bonds, CSD participants are AMA of bond holders.\n(cid:190) Regarding corporate bonds, CSD participants are AMA of bond holders.\n3. Tax Withholding Agent (TWA) for interest payments and redemptions\n3\nTax Withholding Agent (TWA) for interest payments and redemptions\n(cid:190) Regarding government bonds, no WHT (withholding tax) exists in 4 economies \n(CN, HK, MY, and SG).  TWAs in other economies are different economy by \neconomy.\n\n(cid:190) Regarding corporate bonds,  no WHT exists in 3 economies (HK, MY, and SG). \n\nTWAs in other economies are different economy by economy.\n\nSummary of interest payment process of government \nbond for reference\n\n1. When issuers pay interest to investors, paying agents(PA), which are \n\n2.\n2\n\ndesignated by issuers, transfer money to the accounts of account management \nagents (AMA)s which are appointed by investors. \nI\nIn the case of government bonds, central banks play a role of PA except China, \nl\nPhilippines, and Vietnam.

Cross-border STP Survey to include Trading Systems\n\nRegarding trading systems, further survey may better be done from the \nview point of cross-border STP since ABMF survey during phase 1 and \nphase 2 are focusing on down stream processes after clearing in \nphase 2 are focusing on down stream processes after clearing in\nparticular settlement.  Trade information collections system including \ndatabase development may also be surveyed to secure price \ntransparency and improve information flows in the market.\n\n2. Development of Pre-settlement matching Infrastructures\n\ng\n\nSuch matching infrastructures are not  yet developed in ASEAN+3. \nMatching infrastructures are expected to be developed in the region with \nstandardized manner which will make cross-border STP more realistic in \nthe region.  \n\np\n\np\n\ng\n\nFMI: Financial Market Infrastructure\n\n4.1.1 FMI Related Recommendations\n\n3.\n\n4.\n\nDiscussion on CCP\nTransaction volume and value of bond trade and settlement in ASEAN+3 are \nnot very large nor high for the time being.  However, it is anticipated that the \nbond transaction volume (and value as well) increase drastically. Therefore, it \nmay be helpful to start discussion on CCP about under what kind of \nconditions and circumstances a CCP needs to be implemented. Counterparty \nrisk may also be reduced by novation of CCP.\n\nInvolvement of Central Banks \nSince many of CSD and RTGS systems are owned and operated by central \nbanks, it may be advisable for relevant departments such as payment system \ndepartment of the central bank of each economy to join the ABMF discussion\ndepartment of the central bank of each economy to join the ABMF discussion \non standardization of messages and cross-border STP in the region.\n\n56\n\n57\n\n29\n\n\f4.1.1 FMI Related Recommendations\n\n5.\n\nBond Settlement using Central Bank Money\nCentral bank money is used to settle government  and corporate bond \nsettlement in most of the economies because it is risk free money.\n\n4.1.2 DVP Flow Related Recommendations\n\n1.\n\nSTP of Flows related to CSD\nEntering settlement instruction data to CSD is not  automated yet in many \neconomies.  CSDs are to be connected with upstream infrastructures such \nas trading system trade information collection system (database)\nas trading system, trade information collection system (database), \nmatching system in order to promote STP in each economy. Also, the \ntransferred data from the upstream system are to be forwarded to sell side \nand buy side for affirmation. Then, the sell and buy sides send back \naffirmation to the CSD.\n\n(cid:190) CSDs are to be connected with an upstream system such as CCP, PSMS, and \ntrading system to automatically input settlement instruction data from STP \nperspective. \n\n(cid:190) Integrity of data needs to be secured.\n\n58\n\n59\n\n30\n\n\f4.1.2 DVP Flow Related Recommendations\n\n2.\n\nStandardization of DVP Flow\nSince DVP flows are different market by market or even CSD by CSD, \nstandardization of flows  is to be discussed.\n\n(cid:190) Impacts to the core infrastructures such as SSS (securities settlement system) \n(cid:190) Impacts to the core infrastructures such as SSS (securities settlement system)\n\nand RTGS (Real Time Gross Settlement) system should be minimized. But, \nconversions at intermediaries are also to be minimized.  A model flow in \nASEAN+3 may be discussed.\n\n4.1.3 Message Item Related Recommendations\n\n1. Standardization of Core Message Items\n\nThe definitions of message items are different economy by economy.  \nEven  \u201c10 common elements\u201d have different definitions and features in \nsome cases. In order to facilitate cross-border STP, standardization of \nessential messages including settlement instruction and settlement\nessential messages including settlement instruction and settlement \nconfirmation is necessary. \n(cid:190) In ISO15022 and ISO20022, Instruction Identification means Sender\u2019s \n\nmessage reference but there are some exceptions. For instance, in PDEx, CSD \nof Philippines, trading system  numbers instruction identification and in BOJ-\nNet, market infrastructure numbers Torihiki-number as instruction identification. \n(New BOJ-Net will adopt new TorhikiID in accordance with ISO standards.)\n(cid:190) Regarding Trade Date, some CSDs (KSD, PDEx, MAS, TSD and VSD) specify \nthat Trade Date is mandatory But the Trade Date is not even regarded as input\nthat Trade Date is mandatory. But the Trade Date is not even regarded as input \nitem for BOJ.\n\n(cid:190) Settlement Date is mandatory for all CSDs mandatory except VSD, but VSD \ncalculates the settlement date within their system on the basis of Trade Date.\n\n(cid:190) Place of settlement (PSET) is mandatory for PDEx, MAS and TSD, but not for \n\nBOJ, KSD and VSD.\n\n60\n\n61\n\n31\n\n\f4.1.3 Message Item Related Recommendations\n\n2. Migration to ISO 20022\n\nIn ASEAN+3, many of financial market infrastructures(FMI) still adopt \nISO15022 or proprietary messages When market infrastructures have a\nISO15022 or proprietary messages. When market infrastructures have a \nchance to re-construct their systems, it is desirable that they will migrate \nfrom ISO15022 or proprietary to ISO20022.\n\n4.1.4 Cross-border DVP related Recommendations\n\n1.\n\nt\n\nf\n\nt i\n\nid\n\nth\n\nEnhancing Local Currency Availability and Liquidity\nExcept Hong Kong, Japan and Singapore, there remain some FX and \ncash controls for bond trade and DVP settlement in ASEAN+3. Obtaining, \nmaintaining and divesting local currency balances is critical to non-\nresident investors, for the purpose of cross-border bond investments. \nt\nf\nSome impact from FX and funding requirement limitations influence timing \nand cost of transaction processing. Since regulations concerning FX and \ncash controls aim not for bond trade but for other reasons, it may be \ndifficult and inappropriate to abolish or change the regulations. Thus, it will \nbe meaningful to discuss some measures such as cross-border collateral \nto enhance LCY (local currency) availability and liquidity for non-residents \nin the markets which will lead to risk mitigation. \nin the markets which will lead to risk mitigation.\n\nb d\n\nd i\n\nb\n\nt\n\n62\n\n63\n\n32\n\n\f4.1.5 Interest Payment Flow Related Recommendations\n\n1.\n\n2.\n\nDiscussion of the Roles of PA, AMA, and TWA\nIn the process of interest payment from issuers to investors, paying \nagents (PA)  which are designated by issuers, transfer interests to \naccount management agents (AMA). In general, tax withholding \nagents(TWA) pay tax for bond holders to tax office. Central banks, \ncommercial banks, CSDs and Bureau of Treasury, act as TWA. The \nbasic roles of PA, AMA, TWA need to be clarified to find out the \ncommon matters and gaps in order to make cross-border interest \npayment more efficiently. \nStandardization of Interest Payment Flow\nInterest payment flows are different market by market or even CSD by \nCSD, standardization of flows  is to be discussed.\n(cid:190)\n(cid:190)\nl t d i t\n\nInformation flows related interest payment are quite different in this \nI f\nthi\nt\nregion. For instance, in some economies, there are the process of \nsending bond holder lists with tax data and notice of payment details.\nImpacts to the core infrastructures such as SSS (securities settlement \nsystem) and RTGS (Real Time Gross Settlement) system should be \nminimized. But, conversions at intermediaries are also to be minimized.  \nA model flow in ASEAN+3 may be discussed.\n\nit diff\n\n(cid:190)\n\nt i\n\nti\n\nfl\n\nt\n\n4.1.6 Numbering and Coding Related Recommendations\n\n1. Common Rules on ISIN\n\nCommon rules will be needed about numbering and notification of ISIN. \nFor instance, after receiving bond information, a CSD numbers ISIN \nassigned by numbering agency and notifies trustees and CSD \nparticipants on the same day.\n\nd\n\nti\n\nth\ni\n2. Promotion of BIC\n\nt\n\nSome market infrastructures still use proprietary code for financial \ninstitution identification. BIC will be adopted taking the opportunity of re-\nconstruction of their systems. In addition, it is desirable that each \neconomy has common recognition about numbering , notification and \nmaintenance of BIC.\nt\n\n3. Discussion on Investor Identification\n3 Di\nI\n\ntifi\n\nId\n\nti\n\ni\n\nIt is important to ensure the uniqueness of identification of investors in \ncross-border transaction (relating to LEI).\n(cid:190) Each economy should have the methods that each investor has unique ID \nand market infrastructures disclose it timely and clearly. If an economy has \nthe method, it must be recognized by other economies and ASEAN+3 \neconomies may try to harmonize and standardize the method.\n\n64\n\n65\n\n33\n\n\f4.1.7 Business Practice Related Recommendations\n\n1. Market Practice\n\n2 A\n2. Account Structure\n-\n\nt St\n\nt\n\n-\n\nCut off time, fail rule and settlement cycle will be discussed for the purpose \nof common recognition and harmonization. SROs may lead the discussion.\n\nDue to differences of a bond holder\u2019s right to claims on assets, there are \nsome types of account: own account, customer account, pledge account, \ntrustee account and so on. In addition, taxation has influences on account \nstructures: non-taxable account and taxable account. In consideration of the \nabove, it is desirable to discus the standardization of account structures. \nEntitlement may also be discussed.  \n\n3.

Standardize flows and message items\n\n(cid:190) Through the discussion of standard DVP and interest payment flows, ABMF \n\nSF2 will clarify the issues to be standardized identifying practices to be kept as \nit is. In addition, ABMF SF2 will discuss the roles of intermediaries and \ninterfaces for filling the gaps.\ninterfaces for filling the gaps\n\n(cid:190) ABMF SF2 will discuss the standardization of the meaning of basic message \n\nitem: settlement instruction, settlement confirmation and other message  types \nbased on ISO 20022. \n\n2.

Standardize cross-border STP flows\n\n(cid:190) For the purpose of ensuring local currency liquidity and expecting growth of \n\ndemands in collateral, cross-border STP connecting FMIs in the region needs \nto be discussed. \n\n(cid:190) Flows about cross-border DVP, cross-border collateral and cross-border repo \n\nwill be discussed together.\n\n66\n\n67\n\n34\n\n\f4.1.9 Key Summary Policy Recommendations\n\n4. More involvement of FMI operators in particular central banks\n\n(cid:190) Central banks operate majority of CSD and RTGS systems and also play a \n\np y g g\n\np y\nrole as paying agent for interest payment and redemption processes.

characteristics  of  AMBIF. \nMembers  appreciated  the  hard  work  done  by  the  secretariat  and  discussed  various  points, \nincluding the following: \n", "\u2022  A  representative  from  Korea  Financial  Investment  Association  (KOFIA)  argued  that  PB \napproach alone might not be appropriate for Asia because of the institutional diversities of \nfinancial  system  in  this  region.  Therefore,  together  with  the  PB  approach,  which  basically \nfollows the regulation style of the United Kingdom (UK), RB1 approach as in US regulations \nalso  needs  to  be  considered  for  ASEAN  +  3  countries  to  make  appropriate  regulatory \nchoices  according  to  each  own  financial  situation.  The  secretariat  opined  that  PB  and  RB \napproaches are not mutually exclusive because behind all the rules there are principles. The \nPB  approach  is  suggested  considering  that  it  could  make  regulatory  bodies  feel  more \ncomfortable in their discussion for mutual recognition, but both approaches could be applied \nin future discussions, depending on the regulatory bodies\u2019 comfort level. \n", "\u2022  A representative from Tokyo Stock Exchange pointed out the need to clarify legal aspects of \nAMBIF  for  the  purpose  of  consumer  protection,  to  which  the  secretariat  fully  agreed  and \ncommitted continued study. \n", "increased  cross  border  capital \n", "\u2022  A  representative  from  People\u2019s  Bank  of  China  opined  that  i)  AMBIF  could  influence \nmacroeconomic  management  with \nflows  and  such \nmacroeconomic aspects should be reviewed, ii) the key concepts such as investors, eligible \nbonds should be clearly defined, and iii) some information on the Chinese market should be \nrevised.  The  secretariat  agreed  on  the  points,  and  added  that  AMBIF  could  contribute  to \nmore balanced growth and stable macroeconomic environment by deepening local currency \nbond  markets,  although  the  AMBIF  discussion  is  not  directly  related  to  macroeconomic \nissues.    ABMF  will  be  ready  to  address  macroeconomic  concern  of  ASEAN+3  policy \nauthorities, if any specific advice is given.     \n", "\u2022  One international expert raised question on how to build the supply side of AMBIF, including \nthe  channeling  of  key  information  to  potential  issuers.  The  secretariat  replied  that  market \nassociations and SROs are assumed to perform a key role in distributing AMBIF information \nto the market.  \n", "\u2022  Several  participants,  including  the  Assistant  Governor  of  the  Bank  of  Thailand,  raised \nquestions  and  added  comments  on  the  approaches,  concepts  and  targeted  outputs  of \nAMBIF. In sum, the secretariat explained that AMBIF is aiming to make it possible for bond \nissuers  to  issue  bonds  in  any  participation  locations  (without  requiring  physical  presence) \nwith  one  standardized  documentation,  and  for  mutually  agreed  professional  investors \n(AMBIF  investors)  to  sell  and  buy  the  issued  bonds  without  selling  restrictions  among \nthemselves.  To  achieve  the  goal,  mutual  recognition  is  proposed  in  either  a  multilateral  or \nmultiple of bilateral format, using a step-by-step approach. As for the question raised by a \nrepresentative  from  the  Malaysian  Investment  Banking  Association  on  whether  AMBIF  will \nallow foreign currency denominated bond issuance by non-residents, the secretariat clarified \nthat this would be determined by regulatory bodies in each economy.       \n", "                                                 \n1 It  is  generally  understood  that  a  \"rule-based  approach\"  is  the  way  that  sets  detailed  binding  parameters  to  be \napplied  to  individual  cases,  requiring  participants  in  a  market  must  operate  within  the  parameters.  On  the  other \nhand,  a  \u201cprinciple  base  approach\u201d  means  the  way  that  encourages  voluntary  efforts  of  the  market  participants  to \noperate within generally agreed principles; such principles are typically applied in more generic terms than specific \nrules \n", " \n", " \n", "2 \n", "\u2022  The  secretariat  expressed  sincere  appreciation  to  members  for  their  support  in  preparing \nAMBIF proposal and additional comments during the meeting. Based on the points raised by \nthe members, the secretariat will further refine the concept of AMBIF and report it to the next \nABMF meeting.  \n", "In  relation  to  the  AMBIF  discussion,  there  were  information  sharing  sessions  on  i)  the \n", "6. \nmethods for mutual recognition, and ii) the experience of ASEAN Capital Market Forum (ACMF):  \nRepresentatives  from  ASIFMA  presented  to  the  members  the  concept  of  \u2018mutual  recognition\u2019   \nand  \u2018mutual  agreement\u2019  -  the  former  requires  changes  in  regulation  while  the  latter  could  be \nachieved without changes in regulation - together with specific experiences in both concepts. It \nis understood that AMBIF will require mutual recognition on key characteristics, although mutual \nagreement on the sideline issues could add benefits to AMBIF. A representative from Thailand \nSEC presented the progress in ACMF focusing on bond market harmonization.  It is shared with \nthe  members  that  AMBIF  is  different  from  ACMF  initiatives  in  that  i)  ACMF  does  not  directly \nfocus  on  professional  investors,  and  ii)  mutual  recognition  on  the  concept  of  professional \ninvestors and documentation is not included in ACMF.  \n", " (SF2: Identification of bond transaction flows) \n", "The secretariat (Dr. Inui and Mr. Kawai) presented to the members i) updated DVP flows \n7. \nof  corporate  bonds,  and  the  flows  for  interest  payment  and  redemption  of  each  economy,  ii) \npreliminary  findings  of  the  fit  and  gap  (F&G)  analysis  on  the  transaction  flows  and  message \nitems, and ii) draft policy recommendations to enhance STP in the region. \n", "8. \nSome  of  the  National  Members  (NMs)  including  those  from  PRC,  Thailand,  Indonesia, \nand Malaysia provided additional comments on the presented information and flow diagrams for \ntheir  respective  economies  and  some  International  Experts  (IEs)  also  offered  feedback.  The \nsecretariat expressed sincere thanks for the support from the members in identifying the flows \nand  additional  comments.  All  the  comments  were  well  noted  by  the  secretariat  and  would  be \nreflected appropriately. \n", "It  was  the  first  time  that  preliminary  findings  of  the  F&G  analysis  were  shared  with  the \n9. \nmembers, and the secretariat requested careful review of the details of the findings, which will \nbe the basis for policy recommendations. One IE pointed out that the F&G analysis on message \nitems  utilizing  only  10  common  elements  for  a  settlement  instruction  is  not  enough  to  see  the \nwhole process. The secretariat explained that the current analysis, which is focusing only on 10 \nelements due to resource limitation, is to check what can be found through the analysis and it \ncould be expanded in the future to include more items. \n", " As for policy recommendations and roadmap, various points have been actively raised \n", "10. \nby many IEs and some NMs, including the following: \n", "\u2022  The secretariat proposed to include discussion on CCP as one policy recommendation. An \nIE  (from  Clearstream)  opined  that  it  should  be  decided  through  further  discussion  under \ncurrent  situation  in  the  region  where  most  economies  are  not  yet  having  a  CCP  in  bond \ntransactions, although recent regulation changes such as Basel III and the Dobb-Frank Act \nrequire serious consideration of it. Another IE (from J.P.
