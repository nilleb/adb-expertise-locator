It  will  provide \nfinancial  resources  to  implement  selected  reforms  under  the  third  and  final  phase  of  the \nGovernment  of  Tuvalu\u2019s  current  multiyear  policy  reform  matrix  (PRM)  and  will  build  on  earlier \nreforms  supported  by  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  in  strengthening  (i)  public \nprocurement, (ii) public enterprises to improve their commercial orientation and support private \nsector development, and (iii) the fiscal buffer for improved fiscal sustainability.2 \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROGRAM \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\nTuvalu  is  a  fragile  microstate  and  ADB\u2019s  smallest  member.  It  comprises  nine  low-lying \n3. \natolls  with  a  total  land  area  of  26  square  kilometers.  More  than  half  the  population  of  10,800 \n(2013)  reside  on  the  main  island  of  Funafuti\u2014an  area  of  only  2.8  square  kilometers.  The \neconomy  is  small,  narrowly  based,  and  highly  dependent  on  external  sources  of  income  and \nimports. The public sector accounts for around two-thirds of gross domestic product (GDP), and \nthere  is  limited  scope  for  economic  diversification  or  for  private  sector  development.  At  its \nhighest point, Tuvalu is only 4.6 meters above sea level, making it highly vulnerable to climatic \nevents such as tropical storms and sea level rise. For example, Tuvalu experiences an average \nof  two  king  tides  per  annum  where  sea  level  rise  exceeds  3.2  meters,  causing  seawater  to \ninundate  homes,  submerge  roads,  wash  away  crops,  and  contaminate  freshwater  supplies.  In \nMarch  2015,  tropical  cyclone  Pam\u2014a  category  5  cyclone  that  coincided  with  a  king  tide\u2014\nbrought storm surges that inundated Tuvalu\u2019s low-lying atolls. Damage and loss to infrastructure \nand  livelihoods  resulting  from  this  single  event  has  been  estimated  at  $15  million,  or  34%  of \nGDP.3 \n \n4. \nTuvalu\u2019s fiscal challenges. Under the circumstances, achieving fiscal sustainability is a \nchallenge  for  the  government.  It  requires  (i)  prudent  management  of  volatile  and  often \nunpredictable  revenue  sources,  including  fishing  license  fees,  licensing  royalties  for  the \ncommercial  use  of  the  \u201cdot.tv\u201d  internet  domain  name,  and  development  assistance;  (ii) \nexpenditure  restraint  at  a  long-term  sustainable  level,  even  if  revenues  are  high  in  the  short-\nterm; and (iii) the need to manage the fiscal risks from external economic shocks and regularly \noccurring climatic events such as natural disasters. \n \n5. \nTo help smooth revenue volatility, the Tuvalu Trust Fund (TTF) was created in 1987. In \nyears when the market value of the trust fund exceeds its real maintained value, the surplus is \ntransferred  to  the  Consolidated  Investment  Fund  (CIF)  that  the  government  can  draw  upon  to \nfinance  fiscal  deficits.4 Following  the  2008  global  economic  crisis,  from  2009  to  2011  Tuvalu \nexperienced 3 consecutive years of economic contraction and low and declining returns on TTF \n\n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The policy reform matrix phase 3 is in Appendix 4. \n3  World Bank. 2015. Tuvalu Damage and Loss Assessment Summary Report. Washington, DC. An ADB investment \nproject to improve outer islands\u2019 port facilities, some of which were damaged during the tropical cyclone, is planned \nfor 2016. \n\n4  Government  of  Tuvalu.  2008.  Agreement  Concerning  An  International  Trust  Fund  for  Tuvalu.  Funafuti.  The \ntargeted CIF account balance is equivalent to 16% of the TTF\u2019s real maintained value (around 45% of GDP), which \nis  estimated  to  cater  for  up  to  4  years  of  continuous  drawdowns  absent  of  any  new  distributions  from  the  TTF \naccount or budget. \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\nthe \n\nimprove \n\nGovernment  response.  To \n\nfiscal  outlook,  ensure  prudent \n\ninvestments.5 Consequently,  there  were  no  transfers  from  the  TTF  to  the  CIF  from  2009  to \n2012. The downturn in the economy led to budget deficits of 22.5% of GDP in 2010 and 9.0% in \n2011  (compared  to  1.5%  in  2008  and  3.2%  in  2009),  which,  in  the  absence  of  TTF  transfers, \ncontributed to an unsustainable drawdown of funds from the CIF. By 2012, CIF cash reserves \nhad  declined  to  1.1%  of  GDP  from  9.2%  in  2008,  putting  at  risk  the  government\u2019s  ability  to \nmaintain essential public services. At the same time, the government and its agencies entered \ninto new debt, predominantly to finance capital investment. External debt rose rapidly, peaking \nat 56% of GDP in 2010 against a target of 30% of GDP.6 \n \n6. \nfiscal \nmanagement,  and  prevent  the  accumulation  of  debt,  in  2012,  the  government\u2014supported  by \nADB,  the  governments  of  Australia  and  New  Zealand,  and  the  World  Bank\u2014embarked  on  a \ncomprehensive  reform  program.  The  government  adopted  a  medium-term  PRM  that  outlines \nthree  phases  of  time-bound  reforms  from  2012  to  2015,  each  one  supported  by  development \npartners according to their areas of comparative advantage, and implemented through technical \nassistance  and  a  coordinated  program  of  budget  support.  The  PRM  explicitly  targets  a \nsustainable fiscal framework through reform actions in six areas: public financial management, \nfiscal policy, public administration, public enterprise performance and rationalization, and health \nand education management. Reforms achieved under phases 1 and 2 have triggered around $8 \nmillion in budget support from ADB and the other development partners.7 \n \n7. \nSince 2012, the government has worked closely with development partners through the \nPRM  to  create  strategies  to keep fiscal  deficits at  sustainable  levels  (i.e.,  below  10%  of  GDP) \nand  reduce  debt  to  manageable  levels.  Fiscal  management  is  tracked  by  government  on  a \nquarterly  basis  through  the  use  of  fiscal  ratios,  which  provide  a  basis  for  benchmarking  the \ngovernment\u2019s  performance.8 Revenue  and  expenditure  review  committees  were  established  in \n2012 to identify new sources of revenue and to advise the cabinet on strategies to control costs. \nGovernment  revenues  increased  as  a  share  of  GDP  from  56.6%  in  2012  to  73.4%  in  2014, \ndriven  by  strong  fishing  license  revenues,  which  increased  by  55%  over  the  same  period; \nimproved  tax  compliance  following  a  tax  audit  of  public  enterprises;  and  an  increase  in  the \nconsumption  tax  rate  from  4%  in  2012  to  7%  in  2013.9 Government  expenditures,  however, \ngrew steadily from 2012 to 2014, driven largely by increased spending on the overseas medical \ntreatment and scholarships schemes and public sector wages. \n \n8. \nRecognizing  these  three  long  standing  expenditure  pressures,  the  government  has \nformulated  clear  strategies  to  control  these  costs.  Increased  spending  on  the  government \nscholarship  and  overseas  medical  treatment  schemes  from  2010  to  2014  has  been  contained \nby  PRM  initiatives  that  were  implemented  between  2012  and  2014,  specifically  (i)  halting  of \ngovernment-funded  scholarships;  (ii)  reduction \nthe  accommodation  component  and \naccompanied  allowances  of  the  overseas  medical  treatment  scheme;  (iii)  building  up  of \ndomestic  health  service  capacity;  and  (iv)  exploration  of  more  affordable  options  for  overseas \ntreatment,  such  as  sending  heart  patients  to  India.  Outside  the  PRM,  the  government  is \nundertaking  a  phased  series  of  civil  service  reforms  to  reduce  the  wage  bill  from  38%  of \n\nin \n\n                                                \n5  Real GDP growth was \u20132.3% in 2009, \u20131.4% in 2010, and \u20130.6% in 2011.

All actions under phases 1 and 2 have \n\nbeen achieved. \n\n8  The seven fiscal ratios are (i) tax revenue to GDP target of 20%; (ii) recurrent expenditure to GDP target of 60%; \n(iii)  wages  and  salaries  to  domestic  revenue  target  of  55%;  (iv)  Tuvalu  Overseas  Medical  Treatment  Scheme  to \ndomestic revenue target of 6%; (v) Tuvalu Overseas Scholarship Scheme to domestic revenue target of 5%; (vi) \nprimary balance to GDP target of 11%; and (vii) net present value of public debt to GDP target of 30%.  \n\n9   Public  Sector  Management  Sector  Assessment  (Summary):  (accessible  from  the  list  of  linked  documents  in \n\nAppendix 2). \n\n \n\n\f3 \n\n70.9 \n\n16.8 \n\n54.1 \n\n20.5 \n\n30.7 \n\n81.4 \n\n32.8 \n\n8.9 \n\n\u2026 \n\n1.1 \n\n4.7 \n\n4.5 \n\n \n\n33.4 \n\n11.4 \n\n1.6 \n\n6.8 \n\n10.7 \n\nrecurrent  expenditure  in  2014  to  its  target  of  30%  by  2018.    These  reforms  include  (i)  the \nadoption  of  performance  management  guidelines  to  support  the  performance  appraisal  and \nremuneration process in 2015; (ii) a wage freeze during 2015\u20132017; and (iii) the implementation \nof recommendations from a planned wage review in 2016\u20132017, which will focus on adoption of \na  wage-setting  mechanism  to  ensure  that  public  sector  wage  increases  are  in  line  with \nproductivity gains in the economy. \n \n9. \nThe  rapid  growth  in  revenue  by  127%  from  2011  to  2014  saw  a  return  to  substantial \nfiscal  surpluses  in  2012\u20132014. The  government  has  used  these  surpluses  to  rebuild  the  CIF \nfrom  $3.7  million  in  2008  to  $20.4  million  in  2014,  again  providing  an  effective  fiscal  buffer.10 \nNevertheless,  the  Tuvalu  economy  is  vulnerable  to  adverse  climatic  events,  and  the  shock  to \nthe economy from Cyclone Pam (para. 3) is already having a large impact on the fiscal balance, \nwith  a  budget  deficit  of  7.7%  of  GDP  projected  for  2015  and  9.5%  for  2016  as  reconstruction \ngets underway (Table 1). The reconstruction spending, financed by development partner grants \nbut also drawing on accumulated buffers, is expected to be largely completed by 2016. \n \n\nTable 1: Tuvalu Medium-Term Fiscal Framework, 2015\u20132017 \n(% of GDP, unless otherwise stated) \n2015 \nBudget \n40.3 \n\n2015 \nProject \n35.4 \n\n2012 \n23.5 \n\n2013 \n30.9 \n\n2014 \n34.9 \n\n \n\n2016 \nProject \n37.1 \n\n2017 \nProject \n35.4 \n\nTotal revenue and grants ($m) \n\nRevenue \n\nTaxes \n\nNontax \n\nGrants \n\nTotal expenditure ($m) \n\nCurrent expenditure \n\nWages and salaries \n\nCapital expenditures \n\nReconstruction-related \n\nRecurrent balance \n\nOverall balance \n\n$m \n\nTTF distributions to CIF \n\nDebt Indicators \n\nGross public debt (incl. \nguarantees) \n$m \n\nof which: publicly guaranteed \ndebt \nof which: contingent liabilities a \n\nDebt Service b \n\n9.2     \n\n35.9 \n\n\u2026 \n\n\u2026 \n\n(12.1) \n\n10.3 \n\n(10.3) \n\n(10.5) \n\n(12.2) \n\n56.6 \n\n15.0 \n\n41.5 \n\n27.2 \n\n20.9 \n\n68.7 \n\n31.9 \n\n5.7 \n\n\u2026 \n\n8.4 \n\n2.6 \n\n\u2026 \n\n \n\n11.9 \n\n2.7 \n\n4.6 \n\n11.2 \n\n83.1 \n\n19.0 \n\n64.1 \n\n24.6 \n\n23.3 \n\n73.5 \n\n32.2 \n\n7.7 \n\n\u2026 \n\n9.6 \n\n27.5 \n\n7.6 \n\n\u2026 \n\n \n\n11.7 \n\n2.7 \n\n4.0 \n\n11.6 \n\n73.4 \n\n17.8 \n\n55.6 \n\n48.3 \n\n30.2 \n\n85.6 \n\n35.6 \n\n35.0 \n\n4.7 \n\n15.2 \n\n \n\n17.0 \n\n2.5 \n\n10.3 \n\n12.8 \n\n94.5 \n\n19.0 \n\n75.3 \n\n24.9 \n\n40.6 \n\n84.2 \n\n38.0 \n\n(0.7) \n\n(0.3) \n\n5.1 \n\n \n\n\u2026 \n\n\u2026 \n\n\u2026 \n\n\u2026 \n\n13.2 \n\n43.0 \n\n41.1 \n\n56.9 \n\n76.4 \n\n18.3 \n\n58.1 \n\n39.7 \n\n47.7 \n\n86.5 \n\n36.4 \n\n37.3 \n\n18.5 \n\n(10.1) \n\n(7.7) \n\n(12.5) \n\n19.4 \n\n \n\n48.6 \n\n15.3 \n\n2.5 \n\n9.1 \n\n13.2 \n\n73.6 \n\n17.5 \n\n56.1 \n\n22.1 \n\n41.5 \n\n83.9 \n\n34.4 \n\n21.3 \n\n11.9 \n\n(9.5) \n\n(4.4) \n\n4.5 \n\n \n\n41.2 \n\n13.6 \n\n2.2 \n\n7.9 \n\n12.5 \n\n\u2026  =  data  not  available,  (  )  = negative,  $m  = million  dollars,  CIF  =  Consolidated  Investment  Fund,  GDP = \ngross domestic product, PPG = public and publicly guaranteed, TTF = Tuvalu Trust Fund. \na    Contingent  liabilities  are  associated  with  a  fishing  joint  ventures,  of  which  50  percent  is  owned  by  the \nNational Fishing Corporation of Tuvalu, a public enterprise. \nb  reflected as % of exports of goods and services. \nSources:  Government  of  Tuvalu estimates;  International  Monetary  Fund  estimates; World  Bank  estimates; \nAsian Development Bank estimates. \n \n \n                                                \n10 Government  of  Tuvalu.

Since  2012,  the  government  has  completed  and \npublished,  as  part  of  the  government  financial  accounts,  a  stock-take  of  bank  accounts  and \ngovernment  debt  and  guarantees,  obtaining  a  comprehensive  position  of  its  net  liabilities.  A \nfishing joint venture with equal partnership between the National Fishing Corporation of Tuvalu, \na public enterprise, and a Taiwanese fishing company, took out commercial loans in 2009 and \n2014  without  government  guarantees  to  finance  the  building  of  fishing  vessels\u2014a  measure  to \nimprove  productivity  of  the  local  fishing  industry  and  create  local  jobs.  The  joint  venture  has \nsubsequently  paid  off  the  2009  loan  through  profits  and  continues  to  make  subsequent \npayments to reduce their debt.  \n \n11. \nTo  protect  the  economy  against  external  shocks  while  laying  the  basis  for  more \nsustainable  fiscal  balances,  the  government  is  seeking  to  complete  the  program  of  reforms \nbegun  with  ADB  support  in  2012.  Reforms  include  (i)  completing  ongoing  public  procurement \nreforms;  (ii)  improving  the  performance  of  public  enterprises  to  enhance  service  delivery, \nreducing contingent liabilities on the budget, and promoting private sector development; and (iii) \nimproving  management and  maintenance  of  the CIF  buffer fund for  long-term  macroeconomic \nstability and economic self-sufficiency.  \n\n \n12. \nPublic  procurement  reforms.  The  program  completes  the  final  phase  of  public \nprocurement  reforms  begun  in  2012.  Public  procurement  has  been  a  high  priority  for  the \ngovernment,  and  its  inclusion  in  the  PRM  has  led  to  significant  progress.  From  2012  to  2014, \nADB supported the adoption of the 2012 National Procurement Policy, the Public Procurement \nAct  2013,  and  the  Public  Procurement  Regulations  2014.  These  collectively  regulate  public \nprocurement  to  (i)  maximize  efficiency;  (ii)  achieve  transparency  in  procurement  proceedings; \n(iii) promote competition among suppliers, contractors, consultants, and non-consulting service \nproviders;  (iv)  provide  for  fair,  equal,  and  equitable  treatment  of  all  those  seeking  to  obtain \ncontracts with the government; and (v) promote public confidence in the integrity and fairness of  \nprocurement proceedings. The central procurement unit (CPU) was also established to ensure \nthat  government  resources  were  being  effectively  used  for  procurement  transactions,  and \nstandard  bidding  and  other  documents  were  developed  for  use  by  procurement  practitioners. \nThe  development  of  the  CPU  annual  report  and  a  centralized  procurement  website  will  help \nstrengthen public procurement governance. \n \nPublic  enterprise  rationalization.  Tuvalu  has  eight  public  enterprises.11 With  support \n13. \nfrom  the  Government  of  Australia  and  ADB,  significant  progress  has  been  made  in  improving \nthe  policy  and  regulatory  framework  for  public  enterprises.  This  progress  includes  the \nestablishment of the Public Enterprise Reform and Monitoring Unit in 2009; the enactment of the \nPublic  Enterprises  Act  in  2009;  the  removal  of  politicians  and  civil  servants  from  public \nenterprise  boards;  the  timely  submission  of  audited  annual  reports  to  Parliament  for  all  public \nenterprises;  and  the  merger  of  the  Tuvalu  Philatelic  Bureau,  Tuvalu  Post  Office,  and  Tuvalu \nTravel  Office  into  a  single  entity  known  as  the  Tuvalu  Post  and  Travel  Office.  Government\u2019s \nefforts to pursue professional management options for the Vaiaku Lagi Hotel unfortunately failed \nin 2012 due to limited private sector interest. Nevertheless, more reforms are needed to enable \npublic enterprises to operate on a commercial basis, reduce the drain from ad hoc government \nsubsidies on the national budget, and attract greater private sector participation. Resolving the \ncross-liabilities of unpaid bills to public enterprises by the government and unpaid taxes to the \ngovernment by public enterprises would also help operational management. More work is also \nneeded  to  contract  out  selected  activities  of  the  Public  Works  Department  (PWD).  The \n\n                                                \n11 Tuvalu\u2019s  public  enterprises  are  the  National  Bank  of  Tuvalu,  Development  Bank  of  Tuvalu,  National  Fishing \nCompany  of  Tuvalu,  Tuvalu  Telecommunications  Corporation,  Vaiaku  Lagi  Hotel,  Tuvalu  Electricity  Corporation, \nTuvalu Maritime Training Institute, and Tuvalu Post and Travel Office. \n\n \n\n\f5 \n\nconstruction  of  capital  works  has  typically  involved  the  use  of  hired  labor  with  procurement \ncontracts  for  the  supply  and  delivery  of  building  materials  issued  to  the  PWD.  This  practice  is \nneither  competitive  nor  transparent,  and  it  extends  the  responsibility  of  the  PWD  beyond  its \noriginal design and supervision role. The recent escalation of government-funded capital works \nand  cyclone  reconstruction  efforts  has  prompted  the  government  to  develop  a  rationalization \nstrategy to improve the commercial and financial viability of the PWD.  \n \n14. \nTransforming  the  Consolidated  Investment  Fund  to  build  a  fiscal  buffer.  The \ngovernment  recognizes  that  much  of the  improvement  in  the fiscal  balance  during  2012\u20132014 \nwas due to temporary cyclical factors and nonrecurrent revenue.  The government is improving \nthe way it operates the CIF to better insulate the budget and the economy from external shocks. \nOn  the  advice  of  the  International  Monetary  Fund,  the  government  will  aim  to  achieve  a \n\u201cstructural fiscal balance\u201d\u2014a surplus of 0.5%\u20131.0% in 2016-2018\u2014with excess surpluses being \ntransferred  into  the  CIF. 12  To  operate  as  a  fiscal  stabilization  fund,  changes  to  existing \naccumulation and withdrawal rules will be implemented to better regulate the use of the CIF and \nensure its replenishment. These changes will help avoid ad hoc fiscal tightening and the need to \nsearch  for  new,  economically  harmful  revenue  sources  during  economic  downturns,  and  the \nfocus on the structural deficit will strengthen the foundation for policy setting. \n \n15. \nADB\u2019s  value  addition,  lessons  learned,  and  program  modality.  ADB\u2019s  strong \npartnership with the government through two policy-based lending operations in 2008 and 2012 \nand ongoing TA for substantial and highly sensitive public enterprise and procurement reforms \nhas enabled the government to undertake reforms that might otherwise be difficult to implement. \nIn a microstate such as Tuvalu, personal relationships and formal bureaucratic rules inevitably \nshaped government decisions when implementing hard reform actions.13 \n \n16. \nThe program builds on lessons from previous ADB programs in Tuvalu and elsewhere in \nthe  Pacific,  which  highlight  the  importance  of  (i)  maintaining  a  single,  government-led,  policy \nmatrix  to  enhance  coordination  and  collaboration  among  development  partners;  (ii)  using  a \nsingle  tranche  modality  within  a  programmatic,  multiyear  approach  supported  by  several \npartners;  (iii)  implementing  fewer  reforms  that  have  a  large  potential  impact;  and  (iv)  linking \ncapacity  building  TA  support  to  PRM  implementation,  as  capacity  constraints  can  hamper  the \ngovernment's ability to follow through on agreed reforms.14 The program is, therefore, a stand-\nalone policy-based grant operation that will focus on the implementation of the final phase of the \ncurrent  PRM.  ADB  engagement  post-PRM  will  be  sustained  through  ongoing  policy  dialogue \nand  follow-up  TA  to  improve  public  sector  management  and  greater  investments  in  economic \ninfrastructure;  for  example,  $3  million  in  disaster  response  financing  will  be  provided  through \nADB\u2019s Disaster Response Facility, which will build ports in the outer islands of Tuvalu. \n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n17. \nThe  program  is  aligned  with  improved  good  governance,  macroeconomic  growth,  and \nfiscal stability, as prioritized in Tuvalu\u2019s National Strategy for Sustainable Development, 2005\u2013\n\n                                                \n12 International Monetary Fund. 2014.

This \nwill  be  achieved  through  the  implementation  of  selected  outputs  endorsed  by  the  government \nunder phase 3 of the PRM, and it will be supported by ADB TA (footnote 13).16 \n \nC. \n\nOutputs  \n\n18. \nThe  program  will  consolidate  earlier  reforms  supported  by  ADB  in  (i)  public  financial \nmanagement, (ii) public enterprise rationalization and private sector development, and (iii) fiscal \npolicy setting. All six policy actions have been completed. \n \n19. \npublic procurement reforms begun in 2012.   \n\nOutput 1: Public procurement strengthened. The program supports the final phase of \n\nfuture  work  plans  are  expected \n\nOutput  1.1. The first annual report of the CPU was published and approved by \nthe  cabinet  in  2015.  The  annual  report  details  procurement  transactions \nundertaken by the CPU on behalf of the government in 2014, key achievements \nand  challenges  faced  during  2014,  and  outstanding  actions  that  require  further \nattention.  The  inclusion  of  a  2015  work  plan  enables  timely  action  on  individual \nprocurement  transactions  to  avoid  bunching  at  the  end  of  the  year.  For  better \nprocurement  planning, \nto  be  prepared \nsimultaneously  with  the  budget,  as  the  two  are  closely  linked,  especially  in \nrespect of capital expenditure. The government plans to make this report publicly \navailable on the newly created centralized procurement website. \nOutput  1.2.  The  government\u2019s  procurement  website,  which  serves  as  a \ncentralized  resource \ninformation,  was \ndeveloped  and  launched  in  2015.  This  will  enhance  the  government\u2019s  ability  to \nobtain better value for money and use scarce public resources more efficiently. It \nserves  as  a  tool  to  (a)  increase  the  government\u2019s  accountability  on  its  use  of \npublic  funds,  (b)  enhance  the  fight  against  corruption,  and  (c)  increase \ntransparency and legal certainty. The website is also expected to help widen the \ninterest  of  overseas  suppliers,  including  from  Australia  and  New  Zealand,  and \npossibly generate more competition among bidders while generating some cost-\nsaving measures for Tuvalu. \n\nfor  all  public  procurement-related \n\n \n20. \nOutput  2:  Commercial  orientation  for  public  enterprises  and  private  sector \ndevelopment  strengthened.  The  program  supports  the  continuation  of  vital  public  enterprise \nreforms, focusing on efforts to attract private sector participation. \n\ntheir  social  responsibilities.  This, \n\nOutput  2.1.  The Public Enterprise Reform Plan was developed and adopted by \nthe cabinet. The plan will guide government decision making towards enhancing \nthe  commercial  orientation  and  financial  soundness  of  public  enterprises,  and \nclearly  define  and  cost \ntogether  with \nstrengthened  accounting  and  auditing  practices,  will  enhance  the  transparency \nand accountability of public enterprises. \nOutput  2.2. The cabinet approved the sale of a concession for the Vaiaku Lagi \nHotel to a private operator, which is expected to raise operational standards and \nperformance, address maintenance issues, and improve guest facilities.  \nOutput  2.3. The cabinet approved a rationalization strategy for the PWD, which \nallows the contracting out of selected construction works such as building repairs. \nThe  PWD  rationalization  strategy  aims  to  promote  the  contracting  out  of  capital \nconstruction  to  private  sector  contractors,  including  the  purchase  of  required \n\n                                                \n15 Government of Tuvalu. 2004.

The program supports the \n\n(i) \n\nOutput 3.1. The cabinet endorsed changes to the financial instructions under the \nPublic Finance Act to include detailed rules to guide, replenish, and regulate the \nuse of the CIF, ensuring that the target CIF savings balance shall be equivalent \nto  16%  of  the  maintained  value  of  the  TTF  and  regulated  through  a  CIF \ncontributions  and  savings  plan.17 This  reform  will  help  transform  the  CIF  into  a \nfiscal stabilization fund that follows a clear rule of accumulation and withdrawal, \nwhereby  temporary  windfalls  from  external  revenue  sources  (e.g.,  fishing \nrevenues) are saved and can be drawn down when there is a revenue shortfall. \nDuring  the  national  budget  process,  where  the  CIF  balance  at  the  start  of  the \nfollowing  budget  year  is  forecast  to  be  at  a  level  below  the  target  CIF  saving \nbalance, the finance minister will now be required to present to Parliament a CIF \ncontributions and savings plan as a component of the national budget. \n\n \nDevelopment Financing Needs \n\nD. \n\nThe  government  has  requested  a  grant  not  exceeding  $2.0  million  from  ADB\u2019s  Special \n\n22. \nFunds resources to help finance the program. \n\n \n23. \nADB  is  basing  the  size  of  its  $2.0  million  grant  on  the  government\u2019s  financing \nrequirements and the cost of the government\u2019s reform program. Projections of budget financing \nrequirements  (post-cyclone  Pam)  indicate  a fiscal  deficit  of  7.7%  of GDP  in  2015  and  9.5%  in \n2016, equivalent to about $7.9 million.  \n \nThe  governments  of  Australia  and  New  Zealand,  and  the  World  Bank,  confirmed  they \n24. \nwill provide parallel, collaborative grant cofinancing on the completion of their selected reforms \nunder  the  third  phase  of  the  PRM.  The  World  Bank  approved  its  second  development  policy \noperation  on  16  June  2015  following  completion  of  their  actions.  Approvals  from  the \nGovernments of Australia and New Zealand are expected in December 2015 once their actions \nare completed.18 The contributions from each partner are highlighted in Table 2. \n \n\nTable 2: Financing Plan  \n\nSource \nAsian Development Bank  \n\nSpecial Funds resources (grant) \n\nGovernment of Australia (grant) \nGovernment of New Zealand (grant) \nWorld Bank (grant) \nTotal \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \nE. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nAmount \n($ million) \n\n \n2.0 \n1.1 \n0.4 \n1.5 \n5.0 \n\nShare of Total \n(%) \n \n40.0 \n22.0 \n8.0 \n30.0 \n100.0 \n\n25. \nProgram  management.

The MFED, through the CPU, was the implementing agency for output \n1.  The  MFED,  through  the  Public  Enterprise  Monitoring  Unit,  (i)  implemented  output  2.1;  (ii) \nacted as the joint implementing agency with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Environment, Trade, \nLabor  and  Tourism  for  output  2.2;  and  (iii)  acted  as  the  joint  implementing  agency  with  the \nMinistry  of  Public  Utilities  for  output  2.3.  The  MFED  was  the  sole  implementing  agency  for \noutput 3. Ongoing TA (footnote 13) helped the government fulfill program conditions. ADB and \nother  development  partners  supporting  the  PRM  process  agreed  to  a  high-level  coordination \nthe  TTF  advisory  committee\u2014\nand  monitoring  mechanism  comprising  members  of \nrepresentatives  of  the  governments  of  Tuvalu,  Australia,  and  New  Zealand\u2014who  will  monitor \nthe implementation progress of the PRM. \n \nImplementation  period.  The program is being implemented from 1 August 2014 to 30 \n26. \nOctober  2015,  consistent  with  the  government\u2019s  medium-term  fiscal  framework  and  budget \ncycle. \n \nProcurement  and  disbursement.  The  proceeds  of  the  grant  will  be  disbursed  in \n27. \naccordance with ADB\u2019s simplification of disbursement procedures and related requirements for \npolicy-based grants.19 The proceeds will be used to finance the foreign exchange cost of items \nproduced and procured in ADB member countries, excluding items included in a list of ineligible \nitems  and  imports  financed  by  other  bilateral  and  multilateral  sources. 20  Grant  proceeds \ndisbursed against imports will require a certificate from the government stipulating that the value \nof  the  total  imports  of  Tuvalu,  minus  its  imports  from  nonmember  countries,  ineligible  imports, \nand imports financed under other official development assistance, is greater than the amount of \nthe grant expected to be disbursed during a particular year. ADB will have the right to audit the \nuse of the grant proceeds and to verify the accuracy of the government\u2019s certification. \n \n28. \nTranches.  The  grant  will  be  provided  in  a  single  tranche  and  will  be  withdrawn  upon \nsatisfaction  of  grant  effectiveness  conditions,  i.e.,  fulfillment  of  all  the  actions  in  the  program \npolicy matrix. Local currency generated from the grant will be directed to the government\u2019s bank \naccount with the National Bank of Tuvalu to allow provision of supplementary financing for the \n2016 national budget. \n \n29. \nProgram  performance  monitoring  and  evaluation.  The  government  will  monitor  the \nimplementation  and  outcome  of  the  program  using  a  set  of  indicators  and  targets  agreed \nbetween  the  government  and  ADB.  For  each  of  the  agreed  indicators,  progress  will  be \nmeasured  against  the  baselines  in  the  design  and  monitoring  framework.  The  responsible \nimplementing  agencies  will  support  the  review  of  agreed  actions  to  determine  progress  and \nidentify  constraints.  Because  the  outcome  of  the  program  will  be  felt  beyond  the  period  of  its \nimplementation, the monitoring of the PRM will be carried out on a continuous basis by the TTF \nadvisory  committee,  and  the  information  from  this  will  be  included  in  the  program  completion \nreport. \n \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\n30. \nThe  program\u2019s  major  benefit  will  be  its  contribution  to  Tuvalu\u2019s  long-term  fiscal \nsustainability.  Fiscal  sustainability  will  in  turn  help  maintain  macroeconomic  stability  in  the \ncountry and boost growth. Strengthened public sector management will also allow for improved \n\n                                                \n19 ADB. 1998.

Tuvalu\u2019s overall fiscal performance will therefore improve. Budget \nrestraint  and  strengthened  fiscal  management  will  allow  the  government  to  use  the  CIF  more \neffectively as a fiscal stabilizer and reduce Tuvalu\u2019s vulnerability to fiscal shocks. The program\u2019s \nlong-term  impact  will  be  greater government  capacity  for sound fiscal  management,  which  will \nhelp  bring  the  budget  deficit  to  sustainable  levels  while  still  enabling  increased  capital \nexpenditure. \n\n \nGovernance \n\nB. \n\nThe  government\u2019s  ability  to  implement  its  budget  is  integral  to  the  success  of  the \n32. \nprogram.  Internal  controls  and  external  oversight  gaps  identified  by  a  public  expenditure  and \nfinancial  accountability  assessment  in  2011  have  been  strengthened  through,  although  not \nlimited to, better financial record keeping, conduct of annual independent audits, and centralized \ntreasury commitment and expenditure controls. The appointment of a government ombudsman \nin  2014  will  also  help  eliminate  or  greatly  reduce  corrupt  practices  in  government. 21  The \nemphasis  of  the  PRM  on  improving  public  financial  management,  including  measures  to \nimprove  revenue  administration,  accounting  procedures,  reporting,  procurement  policy,  audit, \nbudget formulation, and planning, demonstrates the government\u2019s commitment to managing the \nbudget credibly and effectively. \n \n33. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance,  accountability,  and \ntransparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged \ncorrupt,  fraudulent,  collusive,  or  coercive  practices  relating  to  the  program.  The  program  will \nadhere to ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Implementing the Second Governance and Anticorruption Action \nPlan (2014).22 \n \nC. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\nImproved public sector management will have positive impacts on the delivery of social \n34. \nservices.  Layoffs  will  be  avoided  during  public  enterprise  rationalization,  and  where  they  may \noccur, it is expected that employees will either transition into the private sector or be retained in \nthe  public  sector.  Any  adverse  labor  market  implications  on  future  privatization  efforts  will  be \nundertaken  in  dialogue  with  the  government  and  development  partners  and  supported  with \npipeline TA.23 \n \n\n                                                \n21 The  assessment  was  supported  under  ADB.  2011.

Regular and close dialogue with the government and development partners was carried out \nduring country visits and throughout implementation of the program. \n\n \nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\nThe program faces three key risks:  \n(i) \n\nThe  narrow  economic  base  leaves  the  country  vulnerable  to  shocks.  Should \nthese  occur,  the  reform  focus  would  likely  switch  from  strengthening  public \nfinancial management to short-term stabilization. \nThe political consensus needed to mount program reforms could prove difficult to \nmaintain, particularly for public enterprise reforms. \nCapacity  constraints  and  staff  turnover  could  limit  the  government\u2019s  ability  to \nmanage the program. \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n \n37. \nThe  program  design  mitigates  these  risks.  The  rebuilt  fiscal  reserves  are  helping  the \ngovernment weather potential external shocks. Political consensus has been reinforced through \nthe  government\u2019s  ownership  and  leadership  of  the  PRM  process  and  the  subsequent  reform \neffort.  In  addition,  the  MFED,  with  support  from  ADB  TA  (footnote  13),  has  conducted  a \nconcerted  outreach  program  to  build  wider  support  for  reform  among  parliamentarians  and \nacross  government  ministries.  Capacity  constraints  will  be  offset  in  part  through  new  and \nongoing TA provided by ADB and other partners. Overall risk is assessed to be medium. Major \nrisks  and  mitigating  measures  are  described  in  detail  in  the  risk  assessment  and  risk \nmanagement plan.24 Integrated benefits and impacts are expected to outweigh the costs. \n \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n38. \nThe government has assured ADB that implementation of the program shall conform to \nall  applicable  ADB  policies  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures,  safeguards, \ngender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail in the grant \nagreement. The government has agreed with ADB on certain covenants for the program, which \nare set forth in the grant agreement.
