IEE \nwill be undertaken for selected noncore subprojects. \n \n   \nProject Description  The Renewable Energy Development Sector Project will comprise \nvarious  core  and  noncore  subprojects  that  will  add  about  82 \nmegawatt (MW) power generation capacity with 480 gigawatt-hour \n(GWh) annual energy output. All the energy will be produced from \nrenewable  resources,  thus  avoiding  the  use  of  fossil  fuels.  The \nassociated  power  distribution  networks  will  be  correspondingly \nstrengthened. \n   \nRationale  Indonesia has a very large number of small power grids where \naddition of new power generation capacity using renewable energy \nresources  provides  economic  and  environmental  benefits. \nImplementation of such subprojects will also help restore the power \ndemand  and  supply  balance,  and  improve  the  quality  of  power \nsupply to existing consumers, particularly in the rural regions.  \n   \nObjectives  The Project will expand renewable energy use and thereby limit \nemission of greenhouse gases. \n   \nCost Estimates  The total project cost, including physical and price contingencies and \ninterest during construction, is estimated at $256 million, comprising \nforeign costs of $170 million (66%) and $86 million equivalent of \nlocal costs (34%).  \n   \nFinancing Plan  Source  Foreign  Local  Total  Total Cost \n($ million)  ($ million)  ($ million)  (%) \nADB  115.8  45.2  161.0  63 \nGovernment    54.2  40.8  95.0  37 \nand PLN \nTotal  170.0  86.0  256.0  100 \nADB = Asian Development Bank, PLN = State Electricity Enterprise \n   ", "  iii \nLoan Amount and  A loan of $161 million from the ordinary capital resources of the \nTerms  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  will  be  provided  under  ADB\u2019s \nLondon interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility. The \nloan will have a 25-year term, including a grace period of 5 years, an \ninterest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based \nlending facility, a commitment charge of 0.75% per annum, a front-\nend fee of 1.00%, and such other terms and conditions set forth in \nthe draft Loan and Project Implementation Agreements. \n   \nAllocation and  The proceeds of the ADB loan will be relent to the State Electricity \nRelending Terms  Enterprise (PLN) on terms and conditions acceptable to ADB. PLN \nwill bear interest rate variation and foreign exchange risks on the \nloan. \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  Until 30 September 2008 \n   \nEstimated Project  31 March 2008 \nCompletion Date \n   \nExecuting Agency  Directorate  General  for  Electricity  and  Energy  Utilization  in  the \nMinistry of Energy and Mineral Resources of the Government of \nIndonesia. \n   \nImplementing Agency  PLN \n   \nImplementation  PLN  has  decentralized  day-to-day  operations  and  project \nArrangements  management to strategic business units (SBUs). A full-time sector \nproject director has been appointed to the PLN headquarters to \ncoordinate ADB-funded project implementation. The sector project \ndirector is supported by staff to coordinate specific  functions, i.e., \nproject  implementation  and  schedule,  procurement,  design  and \nengineering,  environment,  land  acquisition,  and  compensation. \nSubproject managers will be appointed to the SBUs, and subproject \nteams will be established to oversee the implementation of individual \nsubprojects. PLN will assign enough qualified and experienced staff \nto the sector project director and subproject managers. Consultants \nengaged under the Project will assist PLN staff. \n   \nProcurement  All procurement to be financed under the Project will be carried out \nin accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. The various \nprocurement  threshold  limits  are  the  following:  (i)  international \ncompetitive bidding for (a) supply contracts of $500,000 or more; (b) \ncivil work contracts for small hydropower plants of $1 million or more; \nand  (c)  turnkey  contracts  packages  of  $1  million  or  more;  (ii) \ninternational shopping for supply contracts of $100,000\u2013500,000; (iii) \nlocal competitive bidding for all civil works contracts, construction of \ntransmission lines, and equipment erection of $100,000 to $1 million; \nand (iv) direct purchase for all contracts below $100,000. The local \ncompetitive bidding  procedures to be followed will be subject to \nADB\u2019s approval. \n   ", "iv   \nConsulting Services  A sector project implementation consultant (PIC) will be engaged by \nPLN to help supervise the subprojects included in the two sector \nprojects that will be implemented concurrently: the Project and the \npower  transmission  improvement  sector  project.  The  PIC  will \nprepare subprojects; and undertake procurement, contract award, \ndesign review, supervision, and monitoring of all subprojects for both \nprojects. The PIC will report to the sector project director and support \nsubproject managers in project implementation. \n \nThe  PIC will be recruited by  PLN using quality-  and  cost-based \nselection  in accordance with ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB on the \nengagement  of  domestic  consultants.  The  PIC  will  provide  an \nestimated  117  person-months  of  international  and  132  person-\nmonths of domestic consulting services.  \n   \nProject Benefits and  The power generation using renewable energy resources will meet \nBeneficiaries  subprojects'  electricity  needs  without  burning  fossil  fuels.  Power \nsupply  will  improve  local  residents'  quality  of  life,  promote \ncommercial  and  industrial  development,  and  be  environmentally \nsustainable. Electricity is used not only by the high- and middle-\nincome consumers, but also by the poor to meet their basic needs. \nElectricity is also vital for economic activities that create employment \nand reduce poverty. The total beneficiary population is about 5.2 \nmillion, of whom about 1.5 million are poor. Around 76,000 new \ncustomers are expected to be connected to the power grid. \n   \nRisks and  Project  success  depends  on  (i)  the  Government's  approval  of \nAssumptions  revaluation of PLN\u2019s assets, and a gradual increase of electricity \ntariff from 2003; (ii) PLN\u2019s decentralization and empowerment of \nSBUs;  and  (iii)  timely  preparation  of  required  documents  for \nsubproject  approval,  efficient  procurement,  and  project \nimplementation.  The  Government  has  assured  ADB  that  PLN's \nassets will be revalued and the tariff increased on time, and PLN has \napproved the establishment of support functions for SBUs. The last \ncondition for success will be met through close monitoring and ADB \nreview  missions.  The  Project  is  in  the  infrastructure  sector  with \nrevenue in the domestic currency, exposing the investment to the \nforeign  exchange  rate.  Ongoing  reforms  aim  at  macroeconomic \nstabilization. Over the long run, power sector restructuring will allow \nprice risk management through a competitive electricity market. Until \nthis is possible, the Government will gradually raise the electricity \ntariff  to  an  appropriate  level  and  reintroduce  an  automatic  tariff \nadjustment mechanism to maintain financial viability. \n   \nTechnical Assistance:   \n   \nObjective and Scope  Technical assistance (TA) will be provided to design, and implement \non a pilot basis, the power welfare scheme (PWS) for low-income \nrural households in the outer islands. \n   ", "  v\nAmount   An ADB-administered TA grant of $800,000 will be provided from the \nDanish  Cooperation  Fund  for  Renewable  Energy  and  Energy \nEfficiency for design and pilot implementation of the PWS. \n   \nImplementation  The TA for the PWS is expected to commence in September 2003. \nPeriod   The TA will be implemented in 24 months, including 4 months for \ndesign study, and 20 months for pilot implementation. \n   \nExecuting Agency  PLN \n   \nConsulting    Services  The  TA  grant  will  finance  international  and  domestic  consulting \nservices, and fund pilot implementation of the PWS. To design the \npilot scheme, the consultant will be engaged in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements \nsatisfactory to ADB on the engagement of domestic consultants. \n \n ", " \nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nix\n -1\n \ni\n ", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL   \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the Republic of Indonesia for the Renewable Energy Development Sector Project. The report \nalso describes proposed technical assistance (TA) for the power welfare scheme, and if the \nBoard approves the proposed loan, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, \nwill approve the TA. \n \n2.  At the request of the Government of Indonesia, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \napproved  a  project  preparation  TA  for  the  outer  island  electrification  project.1 The project \nproposal was included in the Country Assistance Plan (2001-2003) and is now titled Renewable \nEnergy Development Sector Project. The sector project framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES  \nA.  Power Sector Overview    \n3.  The formulation of power sector development policies is the responsibility of the Ministry \nof Energy and Mineral Resources, which discharges its control and regulatory functions through \nthe Directorate General for Electricity and Energy Utilization (DGEEU). The State Electricity \nEnterprise (PLN), the state-owned electricity company, is responsible for the development and \noperation of the power sector and serves over 30 million consumers. The Ministry for State-\nOwned Enterprises exercises the sole shareholder's powers on behalf of the Government. \nPLN's total installed power generation capacity reached 21,000 megawatts (MW) in December \n2001. PLN\u2019s assets include 24,800 circuit-kilometers (cct-km) of transmission lines; substation \ncapacity  of  50,000  megavolt-ampere  (MVA);  and  medium-  and  low-voltage  lines  totaling \n287,500 cct-km. The Java-Bali power grid has 74% of the installed capacity, and the remainder \nis spread over 1,100 power grids.2 \n  \n4.  Electricity is also generated by power plants with an aggregate capacity of about 12,000 \nMW. Large industries and businesses own and operate the plants, and PLN customers own \nabout half of these captive power plants, allowing these electricity users to buy power from PLN \nor generate their own. Since the plants are unregulated, sufficient data is not available to \ndetermine the actual amount of electricity used, or the impact of tariffs on PLN\u2019s power demand. \nIndependent power producers (IPPs), which are under contract to sell all their power output to \nPLN, have the capacity to generate another 3,000 MW. \n \n5.  PLN's  power  supply  extends  to  49,000  (84%)  of  58,000  villages,  and  53%  of  the \nestimated 52 million households are PLN\u2019s customers. The reliability of power supply has \ngenerally been better than in many other developing member countries (DMCs), and Java-Bali \nhas not experienced a system-wide power failure in the past 5 years despite PLN\u2019s financial \nproblems. Industrial and commercial customers find the electricity tariff competitive. Reduction \n                                                 \n1   TA  3481-INO: Outer Island Electrification Project, for $800,000, approved on 23 August 2000.  \n2  Some of the power grids on the three large islands (Sumatra, Kalimantan, and Sulawesi) have 100\u2013500 MW \ncapacity. All the other power grids are smaller, many with only 1\u201330 MW capacity supplying power generated by \ndiesel-based generators to a provincial city and surrounding rural areas. When a sea or mountain range separates \nsuch small power grids, interconnection and economies of scale are difficult to achieve.  \n ", "2  \nof  the  subsidy  on  liquid  fuels3  will  increase  the  cost  of  self-generation and improve the \ncompetitiveness of PLN's supply. \n \n6.  During 1998-2002, the capacity factor increased by about 3%, which indicates that the \nexisting power stations are generating more energy. The load factor has remained in the 67.5\u2013\n69.5% range, indicating that the growth in peak power demand has been normal. The tariff \nstructure for large consumers includes a multiplier to reflect a higher supply during evening \nhours. PLN has also introduced measures that allow it to negotiate lower tariffs to encourage \ndemand-side management. Although the average electricity tariff has risen significantly in recent \nyears, it still remains lower than alternate options, and so energy sales have not been affected \nmuch.  \n \nB.  Power Sector Development Plan \n7.  Until 1997, DGEEU and PLN regularly prepared power sector development plans to \nreflect an annual energy sales growth rate of about 12%, and resources were mobilized to \nimplement these plans. Although the plans were optimistic, PLN could acquire resources to \nimplement new projects. In 1997, about 70% surplus generation capacity was available and \nseveral new power generation projects were under implementation, some by IPPs. The crisis \nhad two significant impacts: (i) the growth of energy sales slowed, reducing the urgency to add \nnew power generation capacity; and (ii) the electricity tariffs could only be gradually raised to \nreflect increased cost of electricity supply, so financial performance results of PLN were poor \nand  it  could  not  borrow  for  capital  investment.  These  factors  introduced  considerable \nuncertainties in the power sector planning process, and available resources barely allowed PLN \nto complete ongoing projects.  \n \n8.  The situation has gradually changed. The annual energy sales growth is now about \n10%, and although the economic forecasts still lack clarity, PLN has prepared power demand \nprojections  corresponding  to  annual  economic  growth  of  3.5\u20136.0%  and  an  increase  in \nelectrification ratio4 from 53% to 75% by 2010. A summary of the power development plan, i.e., \nthe forecast of demand growth and capacity additions required in the power sector, is in \nAppendix 2. The electricity tariff was gradually raised during 2000\u20132002, and the Government \nplans to keep raising it to a level of full cost recovery and a reasonable rate of return by 2005. \nThe projected higher electricity sales revenue will allow PLN to meet the operating costs \n(including power purchase from IPPs) and borrow funds for the new investment required to \nsatisfy power demand growth. A delay in new investment will reduce the reliability of PLN\u2019s \npower supply, and the Java-Bali power grid could have a power shortfall by 2005. To address \nsuch concerns, large consumers may decide to implement new captive power plants, which \nwould be a less efficient and environment-friendly outcome.  \n \nC.  Small-Scale Power Generation \n9.  To promote power generation from renewable energy and private sector participation, by \nmid-1997, PLN had signed power purchase agreements (PPAs) with about 26 companies that \nplanned to add 280 MW from 44 power plants classified as small-scale power generators (less \nthan 30 MW). Unlike the PPAs for the large conventional power plants, the Government did not \n                                                 \n3  The competitiveness of PLN\u2019s supply can be established because of the low barrier for installing captive power \nplants. If large customers assign a low value to the supply, they will use self-generation, reducing PLN\u2019s energy \nsales.  \n4  The electrification ratio is the number of households connected to PLN supply divided by the total number of \nhouseholds. ", "  3\noffer any assurance for the sales revenue to the project developers and the tariff was not linked \nto the exchange rate. The economic crisis significantly changed the project cost structure, and \nthe projects became financially unviable, making project implementation impossible within the \ncosts or within the 3-year period envisaged in the PPAs and allowing PLN to cancel the \ncontracts. The lack of a new agreement on the terms of power purchase has stalled private \nsector development of small power plants.  \n \n10.  The policy of promoting private sector investment in all types of power generation \nprojects is even more relevant now, but it has to be adjusted. The process of selecting project \ndevelopers and determining the terms of power purchase has to be transparent and auditable. \nADB has provided assistance to develop a new framework for private sector participation in \npower generation projects outside Java-Bali for medium-sized projects.5 The Government has \nissued  a  ministerial  decree  to  regulate  the  implementation  of  small  power  projects  using \nrenewable energy sources (less than 1 MW), which obliges PLN to buy the excess power.  \n \n11.  DGEEU has prepared a draft Green Energy Plan: A Strategy to Achieve Sustainable \nDevelopment. It will help maximize the use of renewable energy and promote energy-efficient \ntechnologies. The Government will propose a new energy utilization bill, which will cover energy \nresource management, renewable energy supply and utilization, energy-efficient technologies, \nstandards, environmental protection, pricing, and measures to stimulate higher investments \nthrough  the  private  and  public  sectors.  The  green  energy  plan  includes  consultation  with \nnongovernment organizations (NGOs) and dissemination of information regarding advantages \nof renewable energy and energy efficiency. \n \nD.  Power Sector Policies    \n12.  Based on the Government\u2019s Power Sector Restructuring Policy (August 1998), ADB \napproved a policy-based program loan (the Program) and the associated capacity-building loan \n(TA Loan).6 The Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC) also approved a loan of $400 \nmillion, disbursed in two equal tranches, and linked to the release of the two program loan \ntranches. The first program loan tranche of $200 million was disbursed in March 1999 and the \nBoard's approval is being sought for the release of the second tranche following the enactment \nand promulgation of the Electricity Law 20 on 23 September 2002.7 \n \n13.  The Program seeks to increase power sector efficiency and make it financially viable by \nestablishing a competitive electricity market in Java-Bali. The new electricity law provides the \nnecessary legal framework, and stipulates that competition should be introduced within 5 years, \nstarting with competition for power generation. The law also requires creating an independent \nregulatory body within 1 year, and unbundling power generation, transmission, distribution, and \nsupply.8  \n \n \n                                                 \n5  It is one part of TA 3807-INO: Regional Power Transmission and Competitive market Development, for $500,000, \napproved on 18 December 2001, and financed under the Japan Special Fund. The contract for the consulting \nservices was awarded in September 2002, and the implementation period is 6 months. \n6  Loan 1673-INO: Power Sector Restructuring Program, for $380 million, and Loan 1674-INO: Capacity Building for \nEstablishment of a Competitive Electricity Market, for $20 million, both approved on 23 March 1999.  \n7  Indonesia: Progress Report of the Power Sector Restructuring Program (Loan 1673-INO), planned for Board \nconsideration on a no objection basis by 9 December 2002.  \n8  Two types of supply companies will operate: (i) electricity supply ventures for the low-voltage consumers, which will \nremain uncontested; and (ii) the electric supply agencies for the medium- and high-voltage consumers (accounting \nfor about 56% of the total energy sales in Java-Bali), which will be opened to competition. ", "4  \nE.  Implementing Agency     \n1.  PLN Reorganization and Community Development \n14.  PLN  has  a  two-tier  management  with  a  five-member  board  of  commissioners  of \nnominated government officials, and a five-member full-time board of directors lead by the \npresident  director.  The  management  is  fully  responsible  for  formulating  and  implementing \ncorporate strategies and business plans for utility operations, investments, finance, and human \nresources. Independent auditors review and submit a report on the company\u2019s annual financial \nstatements.  PLN  will  retain  its  primary  license  for  power  generation,  transmission,  and \ndistribution until the enterprise is unbundled in accordance with the new electricity law. PLN has \n(i) two wholly owned subsidiaries that own and operate the power plants in Java-Bali; (ii) one \npower  transmission  unit  in  Java-Bali;  (iii)  two  operation  units  in  Sumatra  responsible  for \ngeneration and transmission; (iv) 16 regional operation units9 in the outer islands and four power \ndistribution  units  in  Java;  and  (v)  several  support  services  for  engineering,  construction, \nproduction, etc. PLN is being reorganized in anticipation of the structural changes. A World \nBank-funded  international  consulting  firm  is  assisting  PLN  in  financial  and  organizational \nrestructuring.  \n \n15.  To  facilitate  the  transition  to  an  unbundled  power  sector,  the  focus  now  is  on \ndecentralization and empowerment of operational units by making them strategic business units \n(SBUs). The corporate office, which earlier made all decisions in operational and investment-\nrelated matters, is now transforming itself as a \u201cholding company\u201d with SBUs as \u201cvirtual\u201d \nsubsidiaries. During the past 2 years, many corporate staff have been relocated to SBUs. SBU \ngeneral managers now exercise full responsibility for energy sales, including the expansion of \nthe distribution network. The larger generation and transmission projects are implemented \nunder the direct control of the corporate office. However, in the next phase of decentralization, \nSBU  managers  will  share  responsibility  for  procurement  and  be  fully  responsible for the \nimplementation of all the projects in their respective regions. SBUs will eventually have the \nflexibility to negotiate agreements for power purchase at the local level based on projected \nenergy  sale  and  revenue.  With  the  strengthening  of  managerial  capacity,  SBUs  are  well \npositioned to coordinate the development and management of the regional power sector with \nthe provincial and regency governments. When local governments establish their financial \ncapacity to invest in regional development and are prepared to adjust the regional electricity \ntariffs to reflect the full cost of the power supply in the region, SBUs are envisaged to be \nseparated from PLN as jointly owned subsidiaries. The new electricity law allows such vertically \nintegrated power companies in the outer islands to be owned by the private sector. Like any \nnetwork industry, economies of scale are available in the power sector. While administrative \ndecentralization may transfer authority to nearly 400 regencies and cities, fragmentation of the \npower sector is not advisable.  \n  \n16.  To discharge its social responsibility, PLN has pursued a community development plan \nto  expand  rural  electrification  and  help  poor  households.  PLN  has  partnered  with  village \ncooperatives (KUDs) to serve the rural regions. By 2001, formal agreements with about 4,700 \nKUDs covered power supply in 44,000 villages and over 22 million household consumers. The \ncooperation includes different functions based on the capacity of the KUDs, such as meter \nreading, bill collection, trouble-shooting and inspection of customer installations, and distribution \n                                                 \n9  The regional operation units, or  wilayahs, in the outer islands have relatively lower annual energy sales (1.5 \nterawatt-hours [TWh]) and number of consumers (870,000). Being small, the regional operation units need to \noperate as vertically integrated utilities.  ", "  5\nnetwork housekeeping. The larger KUDs have management service agreements that include \nthe operation and maintenance (O&M) of local diesel generator sets. PLN provides all the \nrequired training support and expertise, and pays the KUDs for their operational activities. \n \n17.  PLN  has  adopted  another  three  programs  to  directly  benefit  the  poor  and  small \nconsumers: (i) the rural business service, which has benefited 75,000 small entrepreneurs and \nhelped create 29,000 jobs for villagers; (ii) the rural electrification loan, which provides low-\ninterest loans to poor households unable to pay the new connection charge (about Rp60 billion \nto 781,000 consumers); and (iii) the program to empower small businesses and cooperatives, \nwhich extends loans for working capital, and grants for training, quality improvement, and \nmarketing to small businesses and cooperatives (about Rp207 billion\u2014Rp173 billion as loans \nand Rp34 billion as pledges\u2014to over 43,000 units). With its improved financial results, PLN \nallocated Rp13 billion to the scheme in 2002 and 2003.  \n \n2.  PLN Financial Management \n18.  PLN\u2019s financial strategy is based on strict budget control over SBUs and operational \nunits, stringent cash flow norms to maintain a reasonable level of power supply within the \nfinancial constraints, proposals to gradually increase tariff levels for Government approval, \ndetermination of the subsidy necessary to offset the partial cost recovery from small consumers, \nand efficient energy billing and bill collection.  \n \n19.  A  detailed  analysis  of  PLN  financial  performance  is  in  Appendix  3.  The  main \ncomponents  of  operating  costs  are  power  purchase,  fuel  and  lubricants,  maintenance, \npersonnel, and depreciation. The trend for these and other important operational parameters is \nbetter than that in other DMC utilities, particularly the low energy losses (11.5\u201313.5%) and \nreceivables (33-40 days). The debt service cost for foreign currency loans acquired before the \ncrisis is now higher and, based on the policy of the early 1990s, PLN now buys more power \nfrom IPPs instead of investing in new power generation capacity.10 It avoided incurring larger \ndebt to build about 3,000 MW of new capacity. \n \n20.  PLN has pursued an efficiency improvement program based on an operational and \ncapital expenditure audit carried out by international experts in 1999. All units were assigned \nloss reduction targets, which involved several actions such as reduction of fuel consumption, \ninventory levels, maintenance costs, and the billing cycle. Steps were also taken for customer \nvoltage improvement, load balancing, and efficient procurement of spares and consumables. \nPLN estimates that the resultant savings in 2001 were Rp1 trillion. \n \n21.  Under the 1985 electricity law, the Government sets the electricity tariff for various \nconsumer categories to allow PLN to recover all its costs. While this had not been particularly \ndifficult until 1997, the Government has faced a challenge since then in raising tariffs to adjust \nfor  the  higher  costs.  Wider  support  and  greater  transparency  are  now  needed,  including \ndiscussions in the House of Representatives (DPR). A sharp increase in electricity tariff would \nbe  inflationary,  reduce  domestic  savings,  and  thus  slow  economic  recovery.  Despite  the \ndifficulties, the average revenue from electricity sales has increased from Rp211 per kilowatt-\nhour (kWh) in 1999 (when ADB appraised the Program loan) to Rp437/kWh in June 2002. To \noffset a lower tariff for small households (decided by DPR), a subsidy of Rp6.7 trillion covering a \nperiod of 3 years was transferred to PLN in 2001.  \n \n                                                 \n10  The share of purchased energy has increased from 2% in 1997 to 15% in 2001.  ", "6  \n22.  Another correction remains for PLN to incorporate in its balance sheet. The net asset \nvalue does not reflect the fair replacement value. The Government and PLN are discussing a \nproposal to revalue the assets to increase the net asset value from Rp54 trillion to about Rp173 \ntrillion on 1 January 2002. The asset revaluation will attract a one-time tax, which may be \nspread over 5 years, and increase annual provisions for depreciation. The higher charges will \ncause PLN to incur a loss in 2002 and 2003, although the cash generation (sum of net income \nand depreciation) is not expected to change significantly. \n \nF.  Carbon Dioxide Emission \n23.  The Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change \nspecifies targets to reduce greenhouse gas emission in developed countries from their 1990 \nlevels by an average of 5.2% in 2008\u20132012. Although the Kyoto Protocol is yet to be ratified, a \nmarket for emission credits is expected to be established, which would benefit DMCs where the \nmarginal cost of greenhouse gas abatement is lower. A private-to-private transaction of this type \nwas demonstrated in January 2002, when the World Economic Forum purchased 4,000 carbon \nemission credits from the Salak geothermal power plant in West Java. An expression of interest \nwas also submitted to an agency in the Netherlands, offering 8.67 million tons of cumulative \ncarbon emission credits from two geothermal power plants (300 MW) being implemented by an \nIPP. \n \nG.  ADB\u2019s Strategy in the Power Sector \n24.  DMCs should make more energy available in a least-cost and environment-friendly \nmanner, and improve access to it for all, particularly the poor. Mobilizing the required resources \nwill require establishing greater transparency and a competitive environment to promote private \nsector  investment,  and  increasing  supply-  and  demand-side  efficiencies.  Energy  sector \ndevelopment must also be environmentally sustainable. Regional and global environmental \nimpacts must thus be mitigated and greater use of renewable energy sources encouraged. To \nensure that its future operations reflect these requirements, ADB prioritizes reducing poverty, \npromoting private sector involvement, addressing regional and global environmental impacts, \nand promoting regional cooperation. ADB interventions take into account the varying physical \nfeatures, resource endowments, and economic standards of DMCs.  \n \n25.  The 1999 Program loan to Indonesia will be fully disbursed in 2002. The next significant \nchange will take place at end-2007, when the competitive electricity market will be established \nin  Java-Bali.  ADB  is  envisaged  to  consider  another  policy-based  loan  to  support  market \ndevelopment.  \n \nH.  Lessons Learned \n26.  Based on implementation experience of recent projects, particular attention will be given \nto (i) availability of counterpart funds, (ii) security concerns that delay project implementation, \n(iii) streamlined internal procedures for selection of contractors, and (iv) timely availability of the \nright-of-way for transmission lines.  \n \n27.  Availability of counterpart funds has improved significantly with the increase in the \nelectricity tariff, which will eventually be high enough to generate sufficient cash for operation \nand capital expenditure without budgetary support, if the present trajectory of increase is \nmaintained.  PLN  decentralization  will  allow  field  managers  to  closely  monitor  project \nimplementation and take timely corrective steps when necessary. Closer working ties with ", "  7\nprovincial  and  regency  governments  will  help  address  security  concerns;  and  right-of-way \nissues will be addressed by preparing the land acquisition and resettlement plans (LARPs) \nusing a participatory process.  \n \n28.  PLN is the Implementing Agency for two ongoing projects11 that are classified as \"at \nrisk\": (i) the 1993 Power XXIII project, which includes the implementation of the 86 MW Musi \nhydropower  project  in  southern  Sumatra;  and  (ii)  the  1995  project,  which  includes \nimplementation of 522 km of a 275 kilovolt (kV) transmission line in Sumatra, and the 86 MW \nPeusangan hydropower project in Aceh Province in Sumatra. The Musi hydropower project's \nconstruction  was  suspended  in  December  1997  along  with  that  of  a  large  number  of \ninfrastructure projects to limit export credit borrowings. In August 2000, considering that most of \nthe civil works had been completed, ADB approved the use of loan savings to substitute the \nexport credit to build the power plant, albeit considerably delayed. PLN is now evaluating the \nbids for the equipment packages, and contract award is expected by end-2002. Transmission \nline construction in Sumatra was considerably delayed because of difficulties in obtaining the \nright of way. By August 2002, 87% of the length had been completed. In June 2002, the district \nadministration took the lead in finalizing amicable settlements with the affected people, which is \nhelping in the construction of the remaining section. Commissioning of all transmission lines is \nplanned by end-2002. In Peusangan, however, little site work has been possible because of \nsecurity concerns in Aceh. The Government is unable to unilaterally suspend the project as that \nwould adversely influence the ongoing political efforts to find a basis for sharing all resources.12 \nThrough collaborative efforts of the Government, provincial government, and the military, a \nsecurity action plan was prepared in June 2002, and is considered acceptable by prospective \ncivil works contractors. PLN will seek JBIC's approval to rebid the civil works contract and \nextend the loan closing date to 2008, and request an extension of the ADB loan. These steps \nprovide an opportunity to implement the Peusangan hydropower project, which will help avoid \npower shortage in the province and promote balanced regional development, which were the \nADB loan's objectives. The long delay in implementing the three project components will keep \nimplementation progress as only partly satisfactory, and so the projects will technically be \nconsidered \"at risk.\" However, when completed, the projects will provide the urgently needed \ninfrastructure to mitigate power shortage in different parts of Sumatra. \n \nI.  External Assistance \n29.  External assistance (Appendix 4) has played a key role in expanding PLN\u2019s power \nsupply system and diversifying its generation mix. Although the private sector will be playing an \nincreasing role in expanding power generation, PLN will continue to invest significantly in the \ntransmission and distribution systems, and will continue to need assistance from multilateral and \nbilateral sources.  \n \n30.  Since 1970, ADB has approved 28 energy sector projects in Indonesia with a combined \nvalue of $3.13 billion for the power sector and a gas transmission project. ADB has also given \nIndonesia 37 TA grants totaling over $13.6 million for studies on hydropower and geothermal \npower  development,  rural  and  renewable  energy  development,  environmental  impact \n                                                 \n11 Loan 1271-INO: Power XXIII Project, for $275 million ($201.89 million net amount after cancellations), approved in \nNovember 1993; and Loan 1397-INO: Power Development and Efficiency Enhancement Project, for $337 million \n($176.61 million net amount after cancellations), approved in October 1995.  \n12  The Aceh government supports the project, and the additional power generation capacity is needed to avoid \nsevere power shortages. JBIC is cofinancing the front-end civil works and consulting services, and its loan is also \nopen. ", "8  \nassessment, energy efficiency, human resource planning, coal sector policy, gas utilization, gas \nregulatory framework, electricity tariffs, and strategic planning. \n \n31.  ADB has coordinated its operations in the power sector with other agencies, particularly \nthe World Bank and JBIC, on efficiency improvement, cost recovery, private sector involvement, \nand restructuring. The World Bank has provided 29 energy sector loans since 1969, with a \ncombined value of $5.01 billion. The World Bank fielded a pre-appraisal mission in September \n2002 for an energy sector project proposal to be considered for approval in early 2003, which \nincludes, (i) about $90 million for critical transmission de-bottlenecking projects, (ii) about $25 \nmillion for information system to support PLN's reorganization, and (iii) about $2 million for \ninstitutional strengthening. JBIC has provided 127 overseas development assistance (ODA) \nprojects in the energy sector for a total of about $4.6 billion equivalent, and 14 non-ODA \nprojects for a total of about $3.6 billion equivalent. Further JBIC assistance to resume the \nimplementation of the IPP-owned Tanjung Jati B power plant (1,320 MW) is expected by end-\n2002.  \n \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \nA.  Objectives and Scope \n32.  The Project will expand renewable energy use by about 82 MW, which will displace \nenergy generated by fossil fuels (about 480 GWh annually) and thereby limit emission of \ngreenhouse gases. The Project includes (i) subprojects to generate power using renewable \nenergy sources, and (ii) consulting services to help implement subprojects included in the \nProject and the Power Transmission Improvement (PTI) Sector Project.13  \n \n33.  Although the renewable energy subprojects are of relatively small capacity (each less \nthan 20 MW), they will account for 5\u201310% of power generation in their power grids in remote \nregions. PLN will upgrade and expand the distribution network correspondingly to improve the \nquality of power supply and connect new consumers.14 Considering the waiting list for new \nconsumers, the renewable energy subprojects will allow new connections for cold storage and \nice factories, which will help improve the value of outputs from agriculture and fisheries, which \nare  the  mainstay  of  the  rural  economy.  The  adequate  supply  of  power  will  also  help \ncommunities expand piped water supply, education, primary health, communication facilities, \nand entertainment. The Project will help avoid the negative environmental impacts resulting \nfrom fossil fuel-based power generation. PLN will continue implementing its own schemes to \nassist rural consumers (para. 17). The TA for the proposed power welfare scheme (PWS) will \nalso bring power connections to poor households on a pilot scale, which will provide a suitable \nmodel of microfinancing to increase the social impact of electrification programs. The Project will \nhelp improve the financial viability and decentralization of the power sector in accordance with \nthe Government\u2019s energy sector policy. \n \nB.  Subprojects \n34.  Renewable energy core subprojects have been identified on the basis of agreed-on \nselection  criteria.  The  implementation  of  the  core  subprojects  may  commence  after  loan \n                                                 \n13  The two sector projects will be implemented concurrently. Only one consultant is envisaged to be engaged to \nimprove the effectiveness of project implementation supervision.  \n14  In remote power grids, about 70% of household consumers have small connections (450 volt-ampere [VA]), \nadequate only for minimal house lighting and a radio and small television. ", "  9\napproval and effectiveness. These are the Merasap, Lobong, Monganago, and Ndungga mini \nhydropower  plants.  PLN  has  confirmed  that  it  has  not  signed  PPAs  with  private  sector \ndevelopers under the small-scale power generation program for any of the core subprojects.  \n \n35.  PLN will select other renewable energy subprojects: the noncore subprojects that also \nsatisfy the agreed-on selection criteria. It has identified eight such noncore subprojects. The \nnoncore subprojects are being prepared and the list with the salient features is in Appendix 5, \nTable A5.2. In case the priority changes during project implementation, PLN may substitute or \nadd other subprojects that also meet the selection criteria. PLN will seek ADB\u2019s approval to use \nloan proceeds to implement the noncore subprojects by submitting documents satisfactory to \nADB:15 an executive summary of the feasibility report, including cost estimate, contract package \nlist,  and  implementation  schedule;  economic  and  financial  analysis;  initial  environmental \nexamination (IEE) and summary IEE (SIEE);16 social assessment and poverty analysis; LARP; \nand  a  brief  note  establishing  that  the  selected  noncore  subprojects  satisfy  the  following \nselection criteria:  \n \n(i)  Power generation will use a renewable primary energy source, and in the case of \nhydropower, the height of the dam will be less than 15 meters and the reservoir \nvolume limited to 3 million cubic meters. \n(ii)  The subproject will be part of the least-cost development plan for the power grid, \nand it is financially and economically viable. \n(iii)  The  provincial  government  has  confirmed  its  support  for  subproject \nimplementation. \n(iv)  In case another funding agency or lending institution provided resources to \nprepare the subproject, it should indicate that it has no objection to PLN seeking \nADB funds for implementation. \n(v)  In case the subproject has been developed by a private entity, the PPA has \nbecome  invalid,  or  the  project  developer  has  confirmed  its  willingness  to \nwithdraw, and PLN should confirm that the project cannot be competitively bid. \n(vi)  A completed environmental screening checklist should be submitted in cases \nwhere an IEE need not be submitted.17  \n(vii)  Subproject implementation will be completed within the project implementation \nperiod.  \n \nC.  Special Features \n1.  Renewable Energy Resources \n36.  Indonesia has huge renewable energy-based power potential, mainly from small and \nmini hydropower, and geothermal sources. Implementation of the renewable energy subprojects \nwill help establish benchmarks for base and total project costs, which can then be adjusted for \nthe different cost of funds and compared to proposals submitted by private sector developers to \nimplement similar renewable energy projects. The procurement-related information gathered \nduring project implementation will be useful for establishing benchmarks for large private sector \ninvestment, thus clearing the present impasse. The Government and PLN assured ADB that a \nsuitable action plan will be prepared by December 2003 to promote private sector participation \n                                                 \n15  The documentation prepared for the core subproject before loan approval will serve as a sample for the non-core \nsubprojects. \n16 IEE and SIEE will be required only for small hydropower plants with installed capacity more than or equal to 5 MW. \n17  The format of the environmental screening checklist was provided to PLN. The checklist includes aspects \nconsidered when ADB does environmental classification of hydropower project proposals.  ", "10  \nin renewable energy development.18 Local communities will participate in subproject operation, \nwhich will have environmental and social benefits.  \n \n2.  Tariff and Subsidy \n37.  The Government approved a package of measures to restructure PLN\u2019s balance sheet19 \nbut the electricity tariff is still below the cost of service. In consultation with DPR, the tariff has \nbeen increased by 6% at the start of every quarter in 2002.20 The Government agreed to \nincrease the annual average tariff in 2003 and 2004 to reach an economical level of tariff in \n2005 so that PLN will recover all costs and generate sufficient cash for new investments. To \nprevent erosion of PLN's revenue in real terms and to make the tariff more transparent, formula-\nbased automatic tariff adjustments will be made every quarter starting 1 January 2006, taking \ninto account changes in input costs from inflation, changes in fuel prices, and exchange rate.   \n \n38.  The average tariff for small consumers is Rp261/kWh, or about 40% lower than the \noverall average tariff. PLN plans to maintain the lifeline tariff targeted to the small household \nconsumers (450 volt-ampere [VA]), or households in the lowest 20-percentile income bracket. \nThe tariff for these households is expected to remain 30% lower than the average electricity \ntariff for the household consumer category. \n \n3.  Changing Strategic Business Units into Power Companies  \n39.  In the outer island provinces where renewable energy subprojects will be implemented, \nPLN will seek active participation of the provincial and local governments and share the project \ndesign, and information on implementation arrangements with them to obtain their assistance in \ntimely project implementation, and increase subproject impact on the community. \n \n40.  The new electricity law allows provincial governments to participate in managing the \nprovincial power sector, as tariffs can be set regionally. PLN will provide inputs to the provincial \ngovernments to help prepare provincial power development plans and raise the provincial \nelectricity tariff to the level required to generate resources to fund development plans. In \nprovinces that make progress, PLN will create jointly owned provincial power companies. The \nelectricity law allows licenses to be issued to private power companies, and PLN will prepare a \nsuitable framework to encourage the private sector to invest in provincial power companies.  \n \nD.  Cost Estimates \n41.  The total project cost, including physical and price contingencies and interest during \nconstruction, is estimated at $256 million, comprising foreign costs of $170 million (66%) and \n$86 million equivalent of local costs (34%). The project cost includes the estimated costs of core \nsubprojects and identified noncore subprojects (Table 1, 2002 prices).  \n \n                                                 \n18  The envisaged establishment of a market under clean development mechanism after ratification of the Kyoto \nProtocol will help channel additional funds for such renewable energy projects (para 23). The policy and procedural \nissues are being examined in another ADB-funded study (footnote 5).   \n19 The restructuring related to PLN's failure to service  the high-cost Government loans; the unpaid principal amount \n(Rp5.3  trillion)  was  converted  into  a  new  20-year  loan  (including  a  2-year  grace  period)  with  4%  annual \nadministrative charge; and the unpaid interest (Rp15.7 trillion) and penalty (Rp13.0 trillion) were converted to \nequity. \n20  The average revenue from electricity sales will increase to Rp497/kWh ($0.051/kWh) by December 2002. The \nlarge low-voltage consumers in all categories will be paying $0.08\u20130.09/kWh. Consumers also pay a streetlight tax \nequal to 3\u201310% of the energy bill, which is transferred to the regency.

Financing Plan \n42.  The Government has requested a loan of $161 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources to help finance the Project. The loan will have a 25-year term including a grace period \nof 5 years, an interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate  \n(LIBOR)-based lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.75% per annum, a front-end fee of \n1.00% (the fee will be capitalized in the loan), and such other terms and conditions set forth in \nthe draft Loan and Project Implementation Agreements. The Government has provided ADB \nwith (i) the reasons for its decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility on the \nbasis of these terms and conditions, and (ii) an undertaking that these choices were the \nGovernment's  own  independent  decision  and  not  made  under  the  influence  of  any \ncommunication or advice from ADB. The Borrower will be the Government. The proceeds of the \nADB loan will be relent to PLN in dollar and other terms and conditions acceptable to ADB. PLN \nwill bear interest rate variation and foreign exchange risks on the loan.  \n \n43.  Proceeds of the proposed ADB loan will be utilized for the (i) foreign and local currency \ncosts for generation and transmission lines for power evacuation (other than land and access \nroads); (ii) foreign currency cost and 50% of local currency cost for the consulting services; (iii) \nup-front fee; and (iv) interest during construction and commitment charge for the ADB loan. For \ncontracts for civil works, the disbursement will be limited to 90% of the contract value. The \nGovernment and PLN will provide counterpart funds to meet (i) the foreign and local currency \ncosts of expanding and upgrading the distribution network in areas supplied by the renewable \nenergy subprojects; and (ii) 50%  of the local currency cost of the consulting services. The \nGovernment and PLN will finance the costs for land acquisition, access roads, buildings, and \ntaxes for all subprojects. The financing plan is in Table 2. \n \n ", "12  \n \n \nTable 2: Financing Plan \n($ million) \n \nSource  Foreign  Local  Total  Total Cost \n(%) \nAsian Development Bank  115.8  45.2  161.0  63 \nGovernment and PLN  54.2  40.8  95.0  37 \nTotal  170.0  86.0  256.0  100.0 \nPLN = State Electricity Enterprise \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates \n \n44.  Should assets financed by the ADB loan need to be transferred to a successor power \ncompany, ADB's agreement will be sought and arrangements acceptable to ADB put in place to \nensure  that  the  project  implementation  and  operation  continue  satisfactorily,  including  the \nservicing of debt and compliance to other loan conditions. \n \n45.   The Government has sought assistance to meet part of the local Project cost. The \nGovernment needs to support the power sector during 2003-2004, i.e., till the tariff remains \nbelow the economic level; whereas a deferment of the Project could cause deterioration of the \nreliability of power supply. The high ADB cost-sharing ratio is justified given the current fiscal \nsituation of the Government and environmental benefits from the Project. Although a modest \neconomic recovery has been experienced, the fiscal situation remains under severe stress. \n \nF.  Implementation Arrangements   \n1.  Project Management and Consultation \n46.  DGEEU will be the Executing Agency as it is responsible for approval of electricity tariffs \nand implementation of power sector restructuring, which are two critical aspects of the Project. \nDGEEU also has administrative control over PLN, which will be the Implementing Agency. PLN \nhas established SBUs at the regional level to manage day-to-day project implementation and \nensure  achievement  of  project  performance  targets.  PLN  will  establish  the  necessary \ncoordinating functions at the head office to facilitate effective operation of SBUs.  \n \n47.  The project management will follow the decentralized setup of PLN. A sector project \ndirector has been appointed at the headquarters to coordinate all the activities related the \nimplementation of the two sector projects (footnote 13). The sector project director and staff will \ncoordinate  (i)  project  implementation  and  schedule,  (ii)  procurement,  (iii)  design  and \nengineering,  (iv)  environment,  (v)  land  acquisition,  and  (vi)  compensation.  A  subproject \nmanager has been appointed at each SBU and subproject teams will be established to oversee \nindividual subproject implementation.  \n \n48.  The  Project  also  seeks  the  participation  of  the  local  communities  in  finalizing \narrangements to implement LARP before and during implementation and to distribute power. \nThe existing contracts with KUDs for power distribution will be expanded to include the output \nfrom the subprojects. \n \n49.  PLN will engage a sector project implementation consultant (PIC) to help implement \nsubprojects included in the Project and PTI Sector Project. The PIC's scope of work will include ", "  13\n(i) preparation of subprojects; (ii) procurement, contract award, and design review; and (iii) \nsupervision, and monitoring of all subprojects for both sector projects.21 Engaging one PIC for \nboth projects has a considerable advantage  because implementation issues and terms of \nreference (TOR) will be similar. The PIC will report to the sector project director and support \nsubproject managers in project implementation matters.  \n \n2.  Period of Implementation \n50.  The subprojects will be implemented over 5 years, from April 2003 to March 2008. The \nconstruction period of 12 months is required for subprojects using geothermal resources, 22 \nmonths (27 months in Papua) for the mini hydropower plants, and 36-42 months for the small \nhydropower plants.  \n \n3.  Procurement \n51.   All procurement to be financed under the Project will be carried out in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. The following are the threshold limits of various types of \nprocurement: (i) international competitive bidding for (a) supply contracts estimated to cost \n$500,000 or more; (b) civil work contracts for small hydropower plant, $1 million or more; and (c) \nturnkey contracts packages, $1 million or more; (ii) international shopping for supply contracts, \n$100,000\u2013500,000; (iii) local competitive bidding for all civil works contracts, construction of \ntransmission  lines,  and  equipment  erection,  from  $100,000  to  $1  million;  and  (iv)  direct \npurchase for all contracts, below $100,000. The local competitive bidding  procedures to be \nfollowed will be subject to ADB\u2019s approval. The list of contract packages for the core subprojects \nis in Appendix 5, Table A5.1. \n \n52.  PLN will recruit the PIC using quality- and cost-based selection (QCBS) in accordance \nwith ADB's  Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to \nADB on the engagement of domestic consultants. It is estimated that 117 person-months of \ninternational consulting services and 132 person-months of domestic consulting services will be \nprovided. The breakdown of effort and cost estimate are in Appendix 5, tables A5.3-A5.5. PLN \nis taking advance action to recruit the consultant based on a full technical proposal. An outline \nof the TOR for the consulting services is in Appendix 6.  \n \n4.  Disbursement Arrangements   \n53.  Loan funds will be disbursed in accordance with the procedures set out in ADB\u2019s Loan \nDisbursement Handbook. All four disbursement procedures\u2014reimbursement, replenishment, \ncommitment, and direct payment\u2014are envisaged to be used in this Project. An imprest account \n(the Government term is \"special account\") will be established in Bank Indonesia, with a ceiling \nof $16.1 million. The total of any advances requested should never exceed the estimated \nexpenditures for the next 6 months or 10% of the loan amount, whichever is lower. Alternatively, \na more direct mechanism may be used for the fund flow, such as allowing PLN to manage the \nloan expenditure through a special account in its own name. Such a direct mechanism would \nrequire a consensus between the Ministry of Finance and PLN before loan inception. PLN will \nbe responsible for preparing all the withdrawal applications for authorization by the ministry. The \nstatement-of-account procedure can be used for individual payments of less than $200,000 in \n                                                 \n21  To expedite the project implementation prior to loan effectiveness, a separate contract will be prepared for the \nenvisaged consulting services related to (i) and (ii), and the expenditure will be met through a minor change in \nscope of Loan 1397-INO (footnote 11).  ", "14  \nseeking replenishment and liquidation from the special account. Supporting documents, as \ndefined in the  Loan Disbursement Handbook, need to be submitted with every withdrawal \napplication for individual expenditure above $200,000. ADB reserves the right to conduct spot or \nrandom checks of expenditures covered by the statement of account, through disbursement or \nreview  missions.  PLN  will  maintain  comprehensive  project-specific  accounting  records, \nsupporting all transactions, to facilitate any audit review. \n \n5.  Accounts, Audit, and Report   \n54.  PLN will submit audited annual financial statements for (i) PLN as an entity, and (ii) the \nProject. The entity and the Project statements will be audited by an independent auditor and in \naccordance with auditing standards acceptable to ADB. The audited financial statements (for \nthe entity and Project) will be submitted in English to ADB not later than 6 months after the end \nof the financial year. The audit opinion will, among other things, confirm (i) the accounting \nstandards used to prepare the statements, (ii) that PLN has utilized all proceeds only for the \nProject as agreed on between ADB and PLN, (iii) that PLN was in compliance as of the date of \nthe balance sheet with all financial covenants of the Loan Agreement between ADB and the \nGovernment,  and  (iv)  that  statement-of-account  transaction  documentation  has  been \nmaintained to support claims to ADB. \n \n6.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n55.  ADB staff provided PLN with the draft Project Administration Memorandum, which will be \nused to provide quarterly progress reports to ADB, starting from the first quarter after loan \neffectiveness. These reports will indicate (i) the financial status of the subprojects; (ii) progress \nmade and problems encountered during the period under review; (iii) steps taken or proposed to \nremedy any problems; (iv) the status of implementation and compliance with loan covenants; (v) \nenvironmental, LARP, social assessment, and poverty analysis-related indicators for monitoring \nand evaluation; and (vi) a proposed program of activities, expected disbursement, and progress \nof subproject implementation during the following quarter. After project completion, PLN will \nprepare a project completion report (PCR) in the form agreed on with ADB, within 3 months \nafter loan closure. The PCR will review the planned objectives and achievements of the Project, \nincluding costs and benefits, and performance and contribution of all parties associated with its \nexecution. ADB will review implementation at least once a year. \n \n \nIV.  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE    \nA.  Technical Assistance for Power Welfare Scheme \n56.  ADB will provide TA to design and implement the PWS for low-income rural households \nin the outer islands. The Project has potential benefits for the poor, particularly in the rural \nareas, and low-income households can expect significant long-term impacts from extension of \npower supply. However, such households will need support to meet the initial expenses for \nusing electricity, such as buying fixtures, house wiring, and connection charges. The PWS will \nbe  designed  and  implemented  to  defer  the  cost  of  electricity  supply  and  minimize  initial \nexpenses, allowing household income to rise to a reasonable level. As a pilot scheme, a \nrevolving fund will be established to benefit 10,000 poor households.  \n \n57.  The TA is estimated to cost $1 million equivalent, comprising foreign exchange cost of \n$80,000 and local currency cost of $920,000 equivalent. ADB will provide $800,000 equivalent ", "  15\non  a  grant  basis  from  the  Danish  Cooperation  Fund  for  Renewable  Energy  and  Energy \nEfficiency in Rural Areas to cover the entire foreign exchange cost, and $720,000 equivalent of \nlocal currency cost. The outline TOR, cost estimate, and financing plan are in Appendix 7. \n \n58.  TA implementation arrangements will be the following: \n \n(i)  PLN will be the Executing Agency for the TA. The Ministry of Cooperatives \n(MOC), as the co-executing agency, will advise on the initial study of the PWS \nand supervise implementation. KUDs will be involved as suitable in PWS design \nand implementation. Active beneficiary participation is encouraged to sustain the \nPWS. \n(ii)  TA implementation is expected to commence in September 2003 for 24 months, \nincluding 4 months for the first phase of design study and 20 months for the \nsecond phase of implementation. One international and two domestic individual \nconsultants will be recruited for the first phase, either directly or from a consulting \nfirm, for a total of 12 person-months. The  consultants will have expertise in \nmicrofinance, socioeconomic impact analysis, financial and economic analysis, \nand institutional mechanism development. ADB will recruit them using QCBS in \naccordance with ADB's  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other \narrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  on  the  engagement  of  domestic \nconsultants. \n(iii)  KUDs and other agencies acceptable to ADB will implement the PWS in the \nsecond  phase  on  a  pilot  scale,  initially  targeting  about  10,000  low-income \nhouseholds in the subproject areas. Results from the study will be disseminated \nafter  project  implementation  for  expansion  and  wide  replication.  A  project \nimplementation  unit  (PIU)  consisting  of  PLN  and  MOC  will  be  set  up  to \ncoordinate and supervise project implementation, and a domestic PIU consultant \nwill be recruited for a maximum of 2 person-months on intermittent assignments, \nsubject to requests by PLN and MOC, to help supervise implementation. \n \nB.  Plan for a Project Impact Review \n59.  During preparation of the country strategy and program update 2004-2006, ADB will \nconsider inclusion of TA for a sector project impact review to be done after completion of some \nsubprojects. The TA will measure and evaluate project impacts on poverty and labor to help \njustify future investment in  rural electrification. A full poverty impact assessment and labor \nimpact  assessment  will  be  prepared  to  evaluate  direct  and  indirect  impacts  on  benefit \ndistribution and labor market operations. \n \n \nV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \nA.  Economic and Financial Analyses \n1.  Least-Cost Option    \n60.  A least cost analysis was carried out by comparing the costs related to the envisaged \nsubprojects and alternate diesel-based power plants. Three considerations have been taken \ninto account: (i) future growth of power demand and required capacity, (ii) the gap between \navailable dependable capacity and required capacity, and (iii) how to close this gap at the least \ncost. The subprojects will operate as base load power plants and thereby reduce the use of ", "16  \ndiesel-based power plants, mainly to operation during the peak-demand period.22 Financial and \neconomic aspects were compared. The financial and economic superiority of the proposed \nrenewable energy subprojects made them the least-cost option for the power grid expansion \nplan.  \n \n2.  Economic Evaluation \n61.  The economic internal rate of return (EIRR) was calculated for the core subprojects. The \nEIRR was determined by valuing costs and benefits in economic terms. Domestic prices in \nconstant 2002 value were used in economic evaluation. Capital and O&M costs were adjusted \nto remove taxes, duties, and other transfer payments. The local currency expenditures relating \nmostly to nontraded goods were equal to their domestic value, and a shadow exchange rate of \n1.05 was applied to calculate the economic prices of traded goods from their financial prices \n(based on a standard conversion factor of 0.95). The energy available for sale was valued in \nterms of resource cost savings.23 \n \n62.  The EIRR for the four core subprojects was estimated at 19.4\u201322.1%. The results \nshowed that all core subprojects were economically viable and the benefits resulting from the \nindividual subprojects sufficiently high to justify subproject costs, including capital costs. The \nEIRR calculation was subject to sensitivity analysis to test the effect of possible unfavorable \nchanges in key variables. A summary of the least-cost and economic analysis is in Appendix 8.  \n \n3.  Financial Analysis \n63.  The financial analysis of the core subprojects was carried out based on real terms using \nconstant 2002 prices. The financial evaluation assumed that tariffs will be set to achieve the full \ncost recovery and adequate rate of return. The annual load demand in the subproject areas was \nforecast based on a low-case economic growth scenario. The costs included capital investment, \nfuel, and O&M, including those for the associated distribution system.  The financial benefits \nwere based on a comparison of with- and without\u2013project scenarios. The benefits were derived \nfrom  the  estimated  savings  from  substituting  the  existing  diesel  power  plants,  and  their \nreplacement cost (after 10 years) attributed to their shorter life. The financial internal rate of \nreturn (FIRR) for the core subprojects was estimated at 7.4-11.5%, which exceeds the weighted \naverage cost of capital of 4.3%. The robustness of the investment was evaluated by carrying out \na sensitivity analysis for changes in major assumptions. Details about the weighted average \ncost of capital, FIRR, and sensitivity analysis are in Appendix 9.  \n    \n4.  Project Beneficiaries \n64.  The poverty impact ratio\u2014the proportion of net economic benefits accruing to the poor\u2014\nwas estimated for core subprojects by analyzing the distribution of the net benefits, or the \ndifference between economic and financial benefits. The net project benefit directly accruing to \nthe poor was estimated at Rp41,583 million during the life of the subprojects. The poverty \nimpact ratio was estimated at 26%. Indirect economic and social impacts will also arise from \nreduced air pollution.  \n \n                                                 \n22  The subprojects will provide additional reserve margin, which would allow new connections without deterioration in \nthe reliability. \n23  The economic benefits are conservatively valued in terms of resource cost savings as the Project's output will \nsubstitute diesel power generation. There will also be other social and environmental benefits, improvements in the \nreliability of power supply, and new connections that would improve the quality of life in Project areas. ", "  17\n65.  The twelve subprojects for renewable energy use, including four core subprojects, are \nlocated in five regions of the outer islands. The total subproject area population is about 5.2 \nmillion, of whom about 1.5 million are poor. Around 76,000 new customers are expected to be \nconnected to the power grid. The Project is expected to have significant positive impacts on the \nlocal population, particularly the poor. Socioeconomic benefits, which narrow the gap in living \nconditions between the subproject areas and other regions, will make living in the project areas \nmore desirable. The improved power supply will increase jobs, make information and modern \nconveniences more accessible, and stimulate small, medium-sized, and home businesses. The \nProject and the Government\u2019s poverty reduction efforts such as microfinance programs will \nallow the poor, especially women, to raise their household income and standard of living. \n \nB.  Social and Poverty Impact \n66.  The Poverty Reduction Partnership Agreement signed in April 2001 states that in the \nmedium-term, poverty reduction development priorities will focus on growth, human resource \ndevelopment, and good governance. Improving power infrastructure in rural and remote areas \nwill contribute to regional equity and growth. Public infrastructure such as schools, public \nmarkets, and village health clinics are the first served when a village is electrified, and power \nsupply improves access to quality basic services.  Since the initial cost of connection is often a \nbarrier for the poor, the TA will pilot a new mechanism to supplement schemes already in place \nto help defray the initial cost of connection for poor households. KUDs will participate in billing \nand collection, thus involving consumers in service delivery. The innovations will help promote \ntransparent institutions responsive to the needs of the poor. The summary poverty and social \nstrategy, and details of the poverty and social assessment are in Appendix 10. \n \n67.  The beneficiaries view electricity as a \"basic need\" alongside other basic social services \nsuch as education and health. Electricity is valued because it helps improve the quality of life, \ngeneral convenience, personal security, and safety. Households, including poor ones, use \nelectricity in more and more ways the longer they have it, and unless expansion of electricity \nand increased access to it are supported, long-term development achievements will be more \ndifficult to attain. \n \n68.  Almost across the board, most respondents in the subproject areas saw electrification as \nhelping improve (i) education (by allowing people to study or conduct educational activities at \nnight); (ii) health (by encouraging longer clinic hours, use of television to spread information, \ngreater safety by eliminating kerosene lamps); (iii) general equity (by giving women access to \nlabor-saving  appliances);  and  (iv)  economic  activities  (by  promoting  small-business \ndevelopment).  Respondents, even among the relatively poor, were also willing to pay up to \n10%  of  total  household  expenditure  for  all  energy  uses,  as  well  as  substantial  up-front \nconnection charge.  \n \nC.  Risks \n69.  No significant technical risks are associated with the proposed investment. The Project \nis  considered  financially  and  economically  sound  and  capable  of  withstanding  reasonable \nchanges in major parameters. Institutional risks are not considered significant as PLN has a \ncomprehensive organizational structure in the outer islands. However, the success of the \nProject depends on (i) the Government's approval for revaluing PLN\u2019s assets, and a gradual \nincrease of electricity tariff from 2003; (ii) decentralization of PLN and empowerment of SBUs; \nand (iii) timely preparation of required documents for subproject approval, efficient procurement, \nand project implementation. The Government has assured ADB that PLN's assets will be ", "18  \nrevalued and the tariff increased on time. PLN has approved the establishment of support \nfunctions for SBUs. The last condition for success will be minimized through close monitoring \nand ADB review missions. The Project is in the infrastructure sector with revenue in the \ndomestic currency, exposing the investment to the foreign exchange rate. The ongoing reforms \naim at macroeconomic stabilization. Over the long run, the restructuring of the power sector will \nallow managing the price risk through the competitive electricity market. Until this is possible, \nthe Government will gradually raise the electricity tariff to an appropriate level and reintroduce \nan automatic tariff adjustment mechanism to maintain financial viability. \n \nD.  Environment \n70.  The Project has been classified as category B as the subprojects are small scale, not in \nenvironmentally sensitive areas, and will have limited environmental impacts during construction \nand operation. An IEE was prepared for each core subproject. A sample SIEE is in Appendix 11 \nto show the nature of the Project and its likely potential impacts. The sample SIEE includes \nmitigation measures that need to be adopted by the subproject. The IEEs indicate that short-\nterm interference in daily life may be expected during construction due to dust, road damage, \nand noise, while no significantly adverse environmental impacts are expected due to project \nimplementation. Local villagers may be contracted to help manage the watershed for each mini \nhydropower plant, which will not only create jobs but also raise public awareness of resource \nconservation and help protect the natural environment. \n \n71.  The Project will have  positive environmental impacts, as well. The construction and \noperation of the small-scale hydropower plants and associated transmission lines will replace \npower  generation  from  diesel-based  generators,  reducing  carbon  dioxide  emission  and \ngreenhouse gas emissions, thus reducing global warming. \n \nE.  Social Dimensions \n72.  The initial social assessment for all subprojects, compensation policy framework and \nprocedural  guidelines,  indigenous  peoples  policy  framework,  and  LARPs  for  the  core \nsubprojects have been prepared. The summary social safeguard strategy is in Appendix 12. \n \n73.  PLN has shown a strong commitment to the Project in general and to the Papua \nsubprojects in particular. PLN has a sound social development approach, which is sensitive to \nthe cultural, political, and social peculiarities of local project stakeholders.  Several participatory \nmeetings involving local government representatives, PLN staff, and large numbers of affected \npeople,  including  traditional  leaders  and  women,  where  organized  in  Tatui  (Yapen),  Prafi \n(Manukwari), and Amai (Jayapura), which are home to various Papuan indigenous peoples. \n \n74.  The meetings and intensive contact with NGO representatives in subproject areas were \nvery useful for understanding the complexities of Papua. The lessons learned are being used to \nbuild a model of the social development approach needed there. Subproject preparation in \nPapua needs to be fully participatory and contingent on preparing community-driven indigenous \npeoples development plans (IPDPs) fully accepted by the affected communities. Indigenous \ncommunities hold land as a community asset with productive and symbolic values and so the \nresettlement and compensation strategy will have to be adapted to local conditions. It may result \nin  a  compensation  scheme  where  community  development  schemes  will  augment \ncompensation paid to affected households. Subproject construction will start only after the \nparticipatory process has resulted in a plan acceptable to the communities and PLN, and after \nthe  plan  provisions  are  delivered  to  the  people.  The  timeframe  for  social  development ", "  19\npreparation  is  thus  likely  to  be  longer  than  once  thought,  and  successful  subproject \nimplementation ensured only if the social development tasks have been concluded.  \n \n \nVI.  ASSURANCES \n75.  In  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  and  PLN  have  given  the \nfollowing assurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents.  \n \n76.  Private Sector Participation in Small-Scale Power Generation. The Borrower and \nPLN will ensure that for a subproject, that was initially developed by an IPP, to qualify for \nimplementation under the Project, there must be (i) confirmation that the PPA is not signed or is \ninvalid; and (ii) written confirmation by the IPP to PLN of its willingness to withdraw and \nconfirmation by PLN that there is no scope for the subproject to be competitively bid. The \nGovernment and PLN will ensure that a new action plan will be prepared by December 2003 to \npromote private sector participation in renewable energy development. \n \n77.  PLN Financial Management. The Government\u2019s relending to PLN of loan proceeds on \nterms and conditions acceptable to ADB is a condition of loan effectiveness. In addition, the \nGovernment and PLN will ensure PLN\u2019s continuing compliance with financial management \nassurances  on  operational  budgets  and  efficiency  improvement  program  targets  and \ncompliance  with  assurances  on  tariff  levels  for  PLN,  based  on  factors  including  asset \nrevaluation and self-financing ratio.  \n \n78.  Sector  Project  Criteria.  The  Government  and  PLN  will  ensure  compliance  with \nsubproject selection criteria for noncore subprojects, including ADB\u2019s approval of commencing \nimplementation  based  on  submission  of  documents  including  (a)  executive  summary  of \nfeasibility report, including cost estimate, contract package list, implementation schedule; (b) \nsocial assessment; (c) poverty analysis; (d) IEE and SIEE for selected subprojects; and (e) \nLARP and IPDP, where applicable, satisfactory to ADB.  \n \n79.  Project Implementation. The Government will ensure (i) appropriate security measures \nwill be put in place at project sites for the PLN staff, contractors, consultants, and ADB staff to \nperform the assigned tasks; (ii) PLN will streamline the procurement procedures to include \nexperts from headquarters, and SBU staff; (iii) timely and full implementation of LARPs and \nIPDPs; and (iv) all necessary action to make available land, rights of way, and other rights in \nland required for the Project, to prevent project implementation delays.  \n \n80.  Financing Plan.  The Government and PLN will ensure counterpart funds, based on \nannual budget appropriation requested for expansion and upgrading of distribution systems, \nland acquisition, building, taxes, and access roads for renewable energy subprojects, and 50% \nof local currency costs for the PIC.  \n \n81.  PLN Financial Governance. The Government and PLN will ensure, amongst other \nthings, independent audits of PLN and project annual financial statements. \n \n82.  Environmental Safeguards. The Government and PLN will ensure, amongst other \nthings, implementing measures identified in the IEE and SIEE for the core subprojects, and \nsimilarly for the noncore subprojects, all in accordance with the environmental monitoring \nprogram and ADB's environmental procedures requirements and guidelines as amended from \ntime to time.  ", "20  \n \n83.  Social Safeguards. The Government and PLN will ensure (i) preparation of plans to \naddress land acquisition, resettlement, and project effects on indigenous peoples in accordance \nwith CPFPG and IPPF; (ii) LARPs and IPDPs will be prepared in accordance with ADB's \npolicies  on  involuntary  resettlement  and  indigenous  peoples;  and  (iii)  preparation  and \nimplementation of the relevant subproject LARP and IPDP will be a condition for the award of \ncivil works contracts for that subproject.  \n \n84.  Social Protection Plan. Within 12 months of loan effectiveness, the Government and \nPLN will ensure updating and finalization of a draft social protection plan satisfactory to ADB to \nreflect the planned corporate reorganization of PLN taking account of the recommendations of \nthe World Bank-funded consultant. \n \n \nVII.  RECOMMENDATION \n85.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of \nADB and recommend that the Board approve  the loan of $161,000,000 to the Republic of \nIndonesia for the Renewable Energy Development Sector Project from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources with interest to be determined ni   accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based lending \nfacility, an amortization period of 25 years, including a grace period of 5 years, and such other \nterms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft Loan \nand Project Implementation Agreements presented to the Board.  \n \n \nTADAO CHINO \nPresident \n \n25 November 2002 \n \n ", " \nSector Project Framework \n \nDesign Summary  Performance Targets  Monitoring Mechanism  Assumptions and Risks \nGoals       \n       \n?

Introduction \n1.  During the last two decades, the Indonesian power sector's annual average sales grew \nby 12\u201313%. In 2001, the State Electricity Enterprise  (PLN) served 30 million consumers all over \nthe archipelago, and electricity sales totaled 85.5 terawatt-hour (TWh).  About 56% of the \nelectricity was consumed for industry and commerce. PLN operates over 1,100 power grids, the \nlargest being the Java-Bali power grid with a power generation capacity of 18.4 gigawatt (GW). \nHowever, only about 53% of the population is connected to the power grids and so considerable \ngrowth is still needed.  \n \n2.  PLN has prepared a long-term power development plan (2002\u20132010). Based on least-\ncost principles, limited-, low-, medium-, and high-growth scenarios have been considered. The \nlimited-growth scenario is necessary to reflect immediate financial constraints, which may only \npermit completion of the committed projects.   \n \nB.  Existing Power Generation Capacity \n3.  PLN owns and operates about 4,055 generating units with a total capacity of 21,000 \nmegawatt (MW). About 74% of the capacity is in Java-Bali, and the rest is scattered throughout \nthe outer islands (Table A2.1).  \n \nTable A2.1: Installed Capacity of PLN Power Plants \n(MW) \n \nType of Power Plant  Outer Islands  Java-Bali  Total \nHydropower  714  2,391  3,105 \nCombine Cycle       \n  Gas Fired  876   3,268  4,146 \n  Oil Fired  0  2,717  2,717 \nSteam       \n  Gas Fired    1,000  1,000 \n  Oil Fired  310      800  1,110 \n  Coal  590  4,200  4,790 \nGeothermal  20  360  380 \nGas Turbine  646  558  1,204 \nDiesel  2,441  109  2,550 \n    Total  5,511  15,492  21,003 \nSource: PLN       \n \nC.

Total power generation in 2001 was 101.6 TWh, which included the power purchased \nfrom independent power producers (13.3 TWh) and from leased generating plants (0.7 TWh). \nVarious primary energy sources were utilized: coal (33.5%), natural gas (29%), fuel oil (22%), \nhydropower (12%), and geothermal sources (3.4%). \n  \n ", "24 Appendix 2 \nD.  Operating Performance \n5.  Average  transmission  and  distribution  loss  during  1997-2001  was  12.3%,  which  is \nconsiderably lower than in other developing economies.24 The average frequency and duration \nof interruptions reflect the reliability and quality of service provided by a utility to its consumers. \nAlthough performance is generally satisfactory, the 5 year data suggests the need of regular \nmaintenance and upgrading of the distribution networks (Table A2.2). \n \nTable A2.2: Losses and Interruptions \n(%) \n \nItem  1997  1998  1999  2000  2001 \nLosses   12.10  12.34  12.22  11.50  13.48 \nSAIDI  15.15  15.58  14.00  13.90  13.24 \nSAIFI  12.81  18.68  18.49  18.10  15.12 \nSAIDI = system average interruption duration index (hours per customer), SAIFI = system \naverage interruption frequency index (times per customer) \nSource: PLN \n \nE.  Forecast of Power Demand  \n6.  Power demand cannot be forecast with complete certainty. A number of models are \navailable to utilities. PLN uses one based on gross domestic product (GDP) growth rate; level of \nelectrification  ratio;  and  efforts  to  replace  captive  power  supply,  which  is  conservatively \nestimated at 10,000 MW. PLN\u2019s forecast considers a GDP growth rate of 3.5\u20136.0% as given by \nthe National Development Planning Agency (BAPPENAS). The high-growth scenario would \nrequire prohibitively high capital investment in the power sector and, therefore, only scenarios of \nlimited (financial constraint preventing new commitment), low, and medium growth are analyzed \n(Table A2.3).  \n \nTable A2.3: Projected Energy Demand \n(GWh) \n \nEnergy \nDemand  2001  2002  2003  2004  2005  2006  2007  2008  2009  2010 \nJava-Bali                     \nLimited  67,927  74,080   76,440   80,430   84,628   84,628   84,430   84,430   84,430   84,430  \nLow  67,927  74,080   80,029   85,607   91,862   98,486   105,449  113,214   121,900   131,334  \nMedium  67,927  74,080   82,092   89,272   97,469   106,223   115,550  125,463   135,973   147,088  \nOuter Islands                   \nLimited  16,592  18,104   16,956   17,669   18,178   18,511   18,559   18,608   18,657   18,708  \nLow  16,592  18,104   18,422   20,090   21,910   23,898   26,067   28,436   31,022   33,848  \nMedium  16,592  18,104   19,337   21,415   23,721   26,278   29,116   32,267   35,739   39,463  \nSource: PLN \n                                                 \n24  These losses are commonly attributed to technical and nontechnical reasons. Two major reasons for technical \nlosses are that (i) small consumers constitute a relatively high portion of all consumers and are supplied through a \nlarge low-voltage distribution network (440 volts), which has high current flows and high heat losses; and (ii) a lack \nof timely expansion and improvement of the distribution networks causes overloads. The nontechnical reason is \nillegal electricity consumption, either as an unauthorized connection or tampering of energy meters. ", "    Appendix 2  25\n7.  The availability of funds will determine the most likely scenario, and the present plans \nare based on the limited-growth scenario for the Java-Bali power grid. Its energy sales growth \nrate will be 4.2\u20134.6% in 2003\u20132005, less than the growth rate in 1995\u20132001 (8.8%). By 2005, \ncapacity would be fully utilized and the system may not be able to support further demand \ngrowth.  \n \n8.  Under  a  conservative  plan  (low  economic  growth)  that  would  be  possible  with \nimprovement in financial performance, the national electricity sales growth is projected to be \nabout 6.9% per annum. The forecasts take into account the impact of the Government\u2019s \neconomic reform program to reduce poverty and promote regional autonomy. Reforms will \nincrease the electrification ratio from 53% to 75% by 2010. Electricity sales growth rate in the \nouter islands (7.4%) will be a little higher than in Java-Bali (6.8%).  \n \nF.  Generation Expansion Plan \n9.  The installed generating capacity in Java-Bali is 18,700 MW, comprising PLN-owned \nplants of 15,700 MW and independent power producer (IPP)-owned of 3,000 MW. Due to aging \nof PLN\u2019s power plants, about 1,000 MW are not available. A peak power demand of 13,041 MW \nwas recorded on 13 November 2001. The generation capacity expansion plan is formulated on \na reserve margin criterion25 with a loss of load probability of 1 day per year. Based on past \nexperience, a reserve margin of 25\u201330% is required, and in the low-growth scenario, 11,000 \nMW of additional capacity will be needed in Java-Bali by 2010. Considering the financial \nconstraints (limited-growth scenario), addition of only 3,700 MW is likely by 2006. \n \n10.  In the outer islands, about 746 MW generation capacity is under construction, which \nincludes hydropower plants (546 MW) and coal-based power plants (200 MW). The power \nsupply situation in most power grids is unsatisfactory, and the required additional capacity in the \nmedium-growth scenario will be from various power plants: gas turbine (1,400 MW); geothermal \n(50 MW); coal based (270 MW); hydropower (20 MW); diesel based (390 MW); and mini \nhydropower (20 MW). \n \n11.  An estimated $5.5 billion will be needed in 2002-2005, excluding the investment in IPP \nprojects.  \n \nG.  Funds Needed for Transmission, Substations, and Distribution \n12.  To maintain the reliability and quality of power supply, the transmission and distribution \nnetworks should also be expanded to (i) prevent overloading of substations, (ii) provide flexibility \nin operation through interconnecting power grids, and (iii) evacuate power from new power \nplants.  \n \n13.  PLN has prepared an investment plan for 2002-2005 based on (i) energy sales growth \nrate according to the low-growth case for outer islands; (ii) removal of bottlenecks in Java-Bali; \n(iii) operation of IPP power plants; and (iv) interconnections between Java and Sumatra, West \nKalimantan and Serawak, and Java and Bali. The plan indicates a requirement of about $5.5 \nbillion, which is the same as the requirement for additional power generation capacity. \n \n                                                 \n25  An adequate generation reserve should be provided to anticipate the possibility of forced or planned plant outages, \nand also to ensure reliable services. \n ", "26 Appendix 2 \nH.  Planning Constraints \n14.  The higher foreign exchange rate since 1997 has increased PLN\u2019s costs, mainly to \nservice foreign currency-denominated loans, and purchase natural gas and power from IPPs. \nSince a corresponding tariff increase would have transferred the burden to consumers and \nslowed economic recovery, the tariff increase has been gradual. PLN could meet its cash flow \nrequirements for operations but was unable to service the foreign currency-based Government \nloans. Severe constraints were imposed on all new investments. While the demand forecast and \nexpansion-planning exercise indicate a large fund requirement, the financial capacity of PLN \ndoes not permit it to raise its borrowings to $11 billion in 4 years. As long as the electricity tariff \nremains below the economic level, the private sector will also face considerable risk in investing \nin power generation. PLN has taken the following measures to partly address its predicament.  \n \n15.  Efficiency Improvement. To ensure that consumers do not resist tariff increases, PLN \nmust  achieve  high  industry  standards.  It  involves  all  employees  in  improving  operational \nefficiency and promoting prudent capital expenditure. Since the efficiency improvement program \nstarted in 1999, PLN estimates that it has saved about $60 million in operational expenditure. \n \n16.  Rehabilitation of Power Plants. PLN has focused on rehabilitating inefficient and \nderated power plants, which provided larger benefits and required less time to implement than \nadding new power generating capacity. The program includes the following:  \n \n(i)  rehabilitation of seven small hydropower plants in Java (completed in 2000); \n(ii)  efficiency improvement of Muara Karang steam gas-based units 4 and 5 (2 x 200 \nMW),  under  cooperation  with  the  New  Energy  and  Industrial  Technology \nDevelopment Organization of Japan; and \n(iii)  efficiency improvement of Gresik steam oil-based units 1 and 2  (2 x 100 MW) by \nconversion to gas-based units, under cooperation with the Japan International \nCooperation Agency. \n \n17.  Excess Power from Captive Power Plants. PLN is investigating the possibility of \ncooperating with owners of captive power plants to help meet power requirements during high-\ndemand evenings. Based on a December 2001 survey, about 200 MW capacity may be \navailable from such power plants in Java in 2002.  \n \n18.  Demand-Side Management. PLN will launch a demand-side management program in \nclose cooperation with customers on voluntary basis. It will include electricity price adjustment \nduring high-demand periods, energy conservation, and voluntary load curtailment. In the first \nstage, the proposed program has the potential to reduce the peak demand in Java-Bali by 140 \nMW in 2002. \n \n ", "    Appendix 3  27 \n \n  FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE AND PROJECTIONS  \n \nA.  Financial Performance of the State Electricity Enterprise \n1.  The financial performance of  the State Electricity Enterprise (PLN) in 1995\u20132001 is \nsummarized in Table A3.1. \n \nTable A3.1: Past Financial Performance of the State Electricity Enterprise (PLN) \n \nItem  Unit  1995  1996  1997  1998  1999  2000  2001 \n           \nEnergy sales  GWh  49,749  56,932 64,312  65,144 71,004  79,165 85,528 \nSales increases  %    14.4 13.0  1.3 9.0  11.5 8.0 \nOperating revenue  Rp billion  8,306  9,646 11,126  14,036 15,997  22,557 28,625 \nAverage revenues  Rp/kWh  163.0  165.4 169.1  211.3 220.7  279.7 330.6 \nAverage revenue increase  %    1.5 2.2  24.9 4.4  26.7 18.2 \nOperating expenses  Rp billion  6,537  7,713  9,450  16,809  21,503  27,216  31,939 \nEBIT  Rp billion  1,769  1,933  1,676  (2,773) (5,506)  (4,659) (3,315) \nDebt service   Rp billion  576  1,897 3,435  1,602.0 4,043.0  3,894.0 3,971 \nNet income after tax  Rp billion  1,020  1,178  (580)  (9,546) (11,368)  (24,611) 180 \nInternal sources of funds  Rp billion  3.328  4.542 5.833  269 1.426  (7.474) 7,409 \nReturn on assetsa  %  3.7  4.7 3.2  (13.3) (9.3)  (0.9) 0.4 \nReturn on equity  %    4.0 (1.9)  (40.8) (89.6)  (132.1) 0.9 \nOperating ratio  %  78.7  80.0 84.9  119.8 134.4  120.7 111.6 \nDebt to debt + equity ratio  %  27.7  34.7 45.3  64.6 78.5  72.0 71.6 \nDebt service coverage ratio  times  5.8  2.4  1.7  0.2  0.4  (1.9) 1.9 \nSelf financing ratio (annual)  %  12.7  33.6 33.1  40.8 8.0  69.6 79.7 \na Defined as operating income less tax / average net fixed assets in operation.   \nSource: State Electricity Enterprise (PLN) \n \n2.  The lower foreign exchange rate of the rupiah resulting from the 1997 crisis considerably \nincreased PLN\u2019s operating and debt servicing costs. The  operating ratio (operating expense \ndivided by operating revenue) became more than 100%, and the debt service coverage ratio \ndropped below 1.0, indicating that PLN could not service all its debt.26 However, the cash flow \nneeded for operations was possible, as PLN did not service the loans that had been relent by \nthe  Government.  The  default  attracted  a  penalty  of  Rp13  trillion  in  2000,  resulting  in  a \ncumulative loss that not only wiped out the retained earnings from earlier years but also \nthreatened to make the net value (equity and retained earnings) negative, making the company \ntechnically insolvent.  \n \n3.  The impact of higher foreign exchange-linked operating and debt servicing costs was \nforeseen  during  the  preparation  of  the  1999  Loan  1673-INO:  Power  Sector  Restructuring \nProgram  (the  Program)  and  during  loan  appraisal.  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB) \nacknowledged the need to restructure the high-cost debt. At the time, the Government faced \neven greater financial stress and could not immediately offer relief to a state-owned enterprise \non a selective basis. In June 2001, the Government as PLN\u2019s shareholder approved a financial \nrestructuring package that implicitly condoned PLN\u2019s failure to pay interest and the principal \n                                                 \n26  The self financing ratio is still indicated as positive because it is calculated from the cash flows, which do not record \nthe failure to service Government debt.    \n ", "28   Appendix 3 \n \namounts during 1998-2000, and converted these accrued payments (and the penalty for the \ndefault) into new long-term debt and equity. This financial package helped improve the balance \nsheet for 31 December 2000 by including (i) the conversion of Rp15.7 trillion of unpaid interest \nand Rp13.1 trillion of penalties into equity, and (ii) the conversion of unpaid principal amount of \nRp5.3 trillion into a 20-year term loan with an interest rate of 4%. \n \n4.  Helped by the withdrawal of the default-related penalty, debt restructuring under the \nsubsidiary loan agreements, a rising average electricity tariff, the renegotiated power purchase \ncosts, and the government subsidy to compensate for the low tariff for small consumers, PLN \nachieved a net income of Rp180 billion in 2001 compared to a net loss of Rp24.6 trillion in 2000. \nThe government subsidy of Rp6.7 trillion and the decrease in interest and financial charge by \nRp11 trillion significantly improved PLN\u2019s income statement.  The Government has already \nraised the tariff for 2002 by 6% per quarter and will raise it further in 2003-2005 so that it reflects \nthe full cost of supply, including a reasonable rate of return. PLN  is continuously trying to \nimprove its financial position by, among other things, (i) reducing nontechnical losses; and (ii) \nreducing costs by (a) renegotiating power purchase costs, (b) operating power plants using fuel \noil rather than  natural gas, and  (c) reducing fuel costs through contract amendment.  The \noperating ratio will be substantially improved in 2005, indicating that PLN\u2019s financial health will \nrecover by then. Based on the higher projected revenue, PLN has the capacity to borrow for \nnew investments for next 4\u20135 years. \n \nB.  Projected Financial Performance \n5.  The major assumptions for the financial projections are as follows: \n(i)  Exchange rate: Rp9,000/$1 \n(ii)  Inflation rate: 7.2% annually for local costs and 2.5% annually for foreign costs \n(iii)  Fuel prices: linked to international prices in 2004 onward \n(iv)  Maintenance costs: 1% of average net fixed assets in operation \n(v)  Power purchase: reflecting new agreements with independent power producers \n(IPPs) \n(vi)  Energy sales growth (low-growth scenario): increase by 7.6% per annum in 2006 \nonward \n(vii)  Average tariff: increase of  6% every quarter  in 2003 and  5% every quarter in \n2004, and no increases 2005 onward \n(viii)  Government subsidy: Rp3.2 trillion in 2003, and Rp3.3 trillion in 2004 \n(ix)  Annual investment (low-growth scenario): Rp161 trillion in 2003\u20132007 \n(x)  Assets revaluation: carried out on 1 January 2002 \n(xi)  Cost of borrowing: 7% interest on ADB loans and 6.1% per annum on others \n \n6.  The actual and projected financial statements for 1999-2008 are summarized in Tables \nA3.2\u2013A3.4. \n \n7.  PLN  has requested the Government to revalue its assets based on the principles \nrecommended in the ADB-funded technical assistance.27 The net value of the operating assets \nwill increase to Rp173 trillion. Consequently, as of 31 December 2002, PLN\u2019s balance sheet will \nindicate a revaluation surplus of Rp74.1 trillion and government equity of Rp66 trillion, reducing \nthe debt-equity ratio from 61% to 27%. However, the asset revaluation will attract a tax payment \nof Rp8.7 trillion, in equal installments for 5 years starting from 2002.

", "    Appendix 3  29 \n \nfuture years will need to be about Rp12.8 trillion higher.  Accounts payable, including arrears \nfrom IPPs, will significantly decrease from Rp19.9 trillion to Rp5.6 trillion due to reduced power \npurchase costs as a result of renegotiations with IPPs.  To continue meeting all costs and \nprovide a reasonable level of cash balance, a 72% increase in tariff will be needed in 2003. \nHowever, the Government plans to implement a more gradual increase of 20% per annum from \n2003 to 2005, which would allow a 6% rate of return starting in 2005.  \n \nC.  Financial Health of the State Electricity Enterprise (PLN) \n8.  In many ways, PLN is a well-run utility: its operating costs are low, transmission and \ndistribution losses are reasonable, and revenue collection is good. The inadequate tariff level, \nhowever, has adversely affected PLN's financial position. Sales revenue is expected to increase \nto Rp100 trillion in 2008 due to higher energy sales and tariff. The operating expenses\u2014mainly \nfuel and power purchase costs\u2014will not increase by as much, and PLN will have a positive \noperating income in 2004, which will increase gradually from 2005 onward. Foreign borrowings \nof about Rp74.6 trillion will be needed in 2003-2007 for the investment program under the low-\ncase scenario, considering the cash shortfall remaining after equity contribution, operating \nincome, depreciation, and subsidy payment. The tariff increase during 2003-2005 will allow PLN \nto service existing and future debt during the next 3\u20134 years. The debt service coverage ratio \nwill increase to 3.4 in 2004, and the self-financing ratio will be 0.7% in 2003, and 53.9% in 2004. \nAsset revaluation will significantly improve the ratio of debt to debt plus equity from 72% in \n2001, to 27% in 2002, which will make room for larger borrowings. The average collection date \nis projected to remain within the normal range of 27-32 days. \n \n9.  PLN has obtained the Government's approval in principle to seek $804 million in official \nforeign  loans  during  2002\u20132004  from  ADB,  World  Bank,  Islamic  Development  Bank,  the \ngovernments of Belgium and Denmark, and Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau (KfW); and through \nexport credit. \n \nD.  Loan Covenants \n10.  Based on the projected financial performance, the following financial covenants will be \nproposed in the loan agreement: \n \n11.  Revaluation of Assets. The Government will cause PLN to revaluate its assets from 1 \nJanuary 2002, in accordance with the principles included in the ADB-funded study (footnote 2), \nand approve tax payment in five equal annual installments. \n \n12.  Implementation of Electricity Tariff Increases. The Government  will cause PLN to \nimplement (i) gradual tariff increases in 2003 and 2004 to reach an economic tariff level in 2005; \n(ii) a tariff increase from 1 January 2005, to allow PLN to maintain a self-financing ratio of not \nless  than  30%  from  2005  onward;  and  (iii)  a  formula-based  automatic  tariff  adjustment \nmechanism  from  1  January  2006, to  protect the level of  PLN\u2019s  tariffs  in  real  terms  by \ncompensating for changes in (a) the prices and quantities of fuel, (b) foreign exchange rate, and \n(c) domestic prices (inflation). \n \n13.  Operating Ratio. The Government will ensure that PLN will maintain every fiscal year \nafter 31 December 2004, a ratio of total operating expenses to total operating revenue not \nhigher than 85%. \n \n ", "30   Appendix 3 \n \n14.  Debt Service Coverage Ratio. The Government will ensure that PLN will maintain a \nratio of gross internal sources of funds for each fiscal year of not less than 1.5 times the debt \nservice requirements after 31 December 2002. \n \n15.  Average Collection Period. The Government  will ensure that PLN will maintain an \naverage collection period of not more than 40 days after 31 December 2002. \n \n ", " \n \n \nTable A3.2: Consolidated Actual and Projected

Least-Cost Analysis \n1.  The power sectors in the selected regions are scattered, made up of a large number of \nsmall power transmission systems. Power system expansion has been planned considering (i) \nfuture development of power demand and load, (ii) the gap between the available dependable \ncapacity and other required capacity, and (iii) closing this gap at the least cost. \n \n2.  The least-cost analysis was carried out for all core subprojects\u2014Merasap, Mongango, \nLobong, and Ndungga mini hydropower plants\u2014by comparing them with alternate modes of \ngeneration. Since the power sector in the project areas mostly consumes diesel, diesel power is \nconsidered  a  viable  alternate  source.  The  least-cost  analysis  was  conducted  using  2002 \ndomestic market prices. Capital costs and operating costs, including fuel costs, were taken into \naccount, and taxes excluded. The present values of the cost streams of the two options are \ncalculated along with equalizing discount rates for individual core subprojects as in Table A8.1. \nThe environmental costs were not included for diesel. \n \nTable A8.1: Least-Cost Analysis for Core Subprojects \n \nCore Subprojects  Net Present Value  Equalizing \n(Rp million)  Discount Rate \n  Renewable  Alternate  (%) \nResources Based  Diesel Based \nMerasap (1.5 MW)  18,827  21,379  15.8 \nMongango (1.2 MW)  19,805  19,959  12.5 \nLobong (1.6 MW)  25,958  27,463  13.6 \nNdungga (1.9 MW)  24,312  32,059  19.8 \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nB.  General \n3.  The economic analysis was based on a comparison of the with- and without-project \nscenarios. Without the Project, the electricity shortage in the outer islands will be exacerbated, \nwhich may decelerate economic growth and worsen already-imbalanced regional development. \nWith the Project, power generation will be expanded using renewable energy sources, and \npower supply will be extended. Much hazardous emission will be avoided and the quality of life \nwill improve. \n \n4.  The economic analysis was conducted using domestic market prices. The economic \nprice of nontraded goods is equal to their domestic prices, and a shadow exchange rate of \n1.053 (based on the standard conversion factor of 0.95) was applied to calculate the economic \nprice of traded goods. Due to local labor market conditions, an unskilled labor conversion factor \nof 0.75 in domestic prices was considered. Based on these assumptions, the main costs and \nbenefits have been broken down into traded goods, nontraded goods, and skilled and unskilled \nlabor; and conversion factors were calculated to value all costs and benefits in economic terms. \n \n \n ", "44  Appendix  8 \nC.  Costs \n5.  The  main  project  costs  cover  civil  works,  equipment,  incremental  operation  and \nmaintenance  costs,  land  acquisition,  and  resettlement  with  and  without  the  Project.  The \neconomic costs were estimated from financial costs, including physical contingencies. Price \nescalation, interest during construction, and taxes are excluded. Local currency expenditures \nrelating  mostly  to  non-traded  goods  are  equal  to  their  domestic  value,  and  the  shadow \nexchange rate of 1.05 was applied to calculate the economic prices of traded goods from their \nfinancial prices. \n \nD.  Benefits \n6.  Economic  benefits  from  the  renewable  energy  development  subprojects  are \nconservatively valued in terms of resource cost savings. The Project's physical output will \nsubstitute diesel power generation in the project areas. The benefits from the net project output \nare equal to the resources used in the without-project scenario to supply the same amount of \nphysical output from an alternative source of supply, and the value of the benefits depends on \nsavings in the alternative cost of supply, which is diesel in this case. Based on the variable costs \nof alternate diesel power generation, including fuel costs, the unit cost savings from replacing \nthe  diesel  generators  are  estimated  at  Rp809  per  kilowatt-hour  (kWh)  (about  $0.09/kWh \nequivalent). \n \n7.  The lifetime of the renewable energy-based subprojects is about 10 years longer than \nthe alternate diesel generators, assuming that the proposed hydropower plants will last 30 years \nand diesel generators, 20 years. Resource cost savings attributable to new diesel power plants \nafter the initial 10 years of the proposed without-project hydropower plants are valued by \nestimating the unit cost savings from new diesel power plants at Rp1,409/kW (about $0.16/kW \nequivalent), which is based on unit cost of alternative diesel generators. \n \n8.  Replacement of diesel power generation by renewable energy-source power plants will \nimprove person's health, reduce carbon dioxide emissions, and protect the environment. These \nconsiderable  benefits  are  mainly  social  and  not  easily  subject  to  economic  analysis.  The \nenhanced access to electricity in the project areas will increase the use of refrigerators, electric \nstoves, electric fans, air conditioners, home entertainment, community and religious activities, \nand so on, improving the quality of life of local residents, including the poor. \n \nE.  Results of Economic Analysis \n9.  The project benefits will accrue to all energy consumers\u2014residential, commercial, and \nindustrial\u2014in the project areas. The new power plants will improve power supply and solve the \nenergy shortage. The use of renewable energy sources will avoid hazardous emissions and \nmeet additional demand. The Project will also enhance access to electricity and improve the \nquality of life of local residents, including the poor. \n \n10.  The Project's economic internal rate of return (EIRR) was separately estimated for each \ncore subproject for 25 years, including 5 years  of construction (2003-2007) and 20 years of \noperation (2008-2027) (Table A8.2). The results of the economic analysis show that all the four \ncore  subprojects  are  economically  viable  and  the  subproject  benefits  sufficient  to  justify \nsubproject costs, including capital costs. The EIRR calculation was subjected to sensitivity \nanalysis to test the effect of possible unfavorable changes on key variables. \n ", "  Appendix  8  45 \n \nTable A8.2: Economic Internal Rate of Return  and Result of Sensitivity Analysis \n(%) \n \nVariables  Merasap  Mongango  Lobong  Ndungga \n         \nBase Case  21.1  19.4  21.2  22.1 \nSensitivity Tests         \n  i.

The financial analysis  valued  the benefits  in  terms  of  financial  cost  savings  from \nreplacing existing and future capital, operation and maintenance (O&M), and fuel costs of diesel \npower  plants  as  the  alternative  source  of  power  supply,  which  is  consistent  with  the \nnonincremental nature of the subprojects. The analysis also takes into account the cost of the \nassociated distribution system.  \n \nB.  Capital Costs and Financial Benefits \n2.  The project costs include capital investment, fuel, and O&M. The capital costs for the \nrenewable energy subprojects include the  engineering, civil, and structural work; mechanical \nand  electrical  equipment;  and  transmission  equipment,  including  that  for  the  associated \ndistribution system. The costs for land acquisition, buildings, resettlement, and access road are \nalso included.  Annual capital expenditures are based on  the investment program of  State \nElectricity Enterprise (PLN). All capital costs are expressed in real terms using constant 2002 \nprices. The financial internal rate of return (FIRR) was calculated considering the base costs, \nexcluding  price  contingency  and  interest  during  construction.  No  residual  value  of  the \nsubprojects was considered in this analysis. \n \n3.  The financial benefits are  based on a comparison of scenarios with and without the \nProject.   The benefits derived from the estimated savings from substituting the existing diesel \npower plants and their replacement cost (after 10 years) attributed to their shorter life.  All \nbenefits are expressed in real terms using constant 2002 prices.  \n \nC.  Weighted Average Cost of Capital and Other Assumptions \n4.  The FIRR was compared with the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) of 4.29%, \nwhich was determined based on the following assumptions: \n \n(i)  Asian Development Bank (ADB) loan:  $161 million (63.0% of total funding), \ninterest rate of 5.6% per annum; \n(ii)  local loan: $32 million (12% of total funding), interest rate of 20% per annum; \n(iii)  government funds: $63 million (25% of total funding), nominal cost of 10.6% per \nannum; \n(iv)  tax rate: 30%; \n(v)  inflation rate: 7.2% per annum for local cost; \n(vi)  real cost: ADB loan\u20143.92%, local loan\u20146.34%, government funds\u20143.17%; and \n(vii)  minimum rate test: 4%. \n \n5.  The  FIRR  analysis  covers  25  years  of  project  life,  including  5  years  for  project \nimplementation. The annual load demand in the core subproject areas has been forecast based \non the low-case scenario. Comparing the with- and without-project scenarios, cost savings from \nfuel and O&M will accrue during subproject operation, and capital cost saving during the initial 3 \nyears of construction. The capacity factors of generation plants  are assumed to be  57\u201385% \nbased on hydrological factors in the different subproject areas. \n ", "  Appendix  9  47 \nD.  Financial Internal Rate of Return and Sensitivity \n6.  The FIRR analysis was calculated separately  for the four core subprojects\u2014the mini \nhydropower plants in Merasap (1.5 MW), Lobong (1.6 MW), Mongango (1.2 MW), and Ndungga \n(1.9 MW)\u2014because each is connected to a separate power grid. Table A9.1 shows a summary \nof the FIRR.  \n \nTable A9.1: Summary of Financial Internal Rate of Return \n(%) \n \nSubproject  FIRR \nMerasap  8.8 \nLobong  8.3 \nMongango  7.4 \nNdungga  11.5 \n      Source: Asian Development Bank estimates \n \n7.  The core subproject FIRRs exceed the WACC of 4.29%, and so the base-case FIRRs \nwere considered satisfactory.  The financial net present values, which are discounted at the \nWACC, are also positive. \n \n8.  To determine the robustness of the results obtained in the base-case scenario and to \nidentify the possible risks, a sensitivity analysis was carried out on changes in major key \nvariables. It covers three variables: an increase in capital expenditures by 10%, decrease in \nbenefits by 10%, and delay in implementation by 1 year. Another two worst-case scenarios are \nconsidered: when two of the above variables combine. The summary of sensitivity analysis is \ngiven in Table A9.2. \n \nTable A9.2: Variables and Result of Sensitivity Analysis \n(%) \n \nVariables  Merasap  Lobong  Mongango  Ndungga \nBase Case  8.8  8.3  7.4  11.5 \nCapital Expenditure (+10%)  7.6  7.2  6.2  10.2 \nBenefits (\u201310%)  7.3  6.9  6.0  10.0 \nPower output (\u201310%)  8.3  7.8  6.9  10.9 \nWorst Case 1a   6.2  5.8  4.9  8.7 \nWorst Case 2 b   7.8  6.8  5.8  9.7 \nNote: \na   A combination of capital expenditure increase and benefits decrease.  \nb   A combination of capital expenditure increase and implementation delay.  \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates \n \n9.  The result of the sensitivity analysis shows that all the core subprojects achieve FIRRs \nof more than 4.29% of WACC in all cases, including the two worst-case scenarios. The FIRR is \nthus adequate and all the core subprojects are financially viable. \n ", "48  Appendix  10 \nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY \n \nA.

Development \nof the power sector contributes directly to each area of intervention. Improving power infrastructure in rural and \nremote areas contributes to regional equity and growth. Public infrastructure such as schools, public markets, and \nvillage health clinics are the first to be served when a village is electrified, and electricity improves access to quality \nbasic services. Beneficiaries always view electricity as a \"basic need\" alongside other basic social services such as \neducation and health. Electricity is valued because it helps improve the quality of life, general convenience, personal \nsecurity, and safety. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis  Proposed Classification: Others \nAnalysis: \nThe poverty impact ratio (PIR) expressing the proportion of net economic benefits accruing to the poor was estimated \nfor core subprojects by analyzing the distribution of the net benefits, or the difference between the economic and \nfinancial benefits. The net project benefit directly accruing to the poor is estimated at Rp41,583 million during the life \nof the subprojects, and the PIR is estimated at 26%. Indirect economic and social impacts also arise from reduced air \npollution. A substantial portion of the core subject benefits will thus go directly to the poor, and the Project will achieve \nits primary objective of pro-poor economic growth. \n \nC.

The Renewable Energy Development Sector Project is not classified as a poverty \nintervention, but poverty was a screening criterion used to select subprojects, and most of the \nbeneficiary  populations  suffer  more  varieties  of  poverty  and  have  more  poverty-related \ncharacteristics than average. \n \n2.  Electrification expands household consumption. The Enpogen study28 documented how \nrural poor see electricity as an important way to improve their overall quality of life, make \nhousework  easier,  and  improve  feelings  of  security  (via  outside  lighting  at  night)  at  the \nhousehold  and  community  levels.  Besides  providing  household  lighting  (the  main  initial \napplication  of  electrification  among  the  poor),  electrification  opens  up  possibilities  for \nentertainment and access to information via television or radio, and for the purchase of labor-\nsaving household appliances such as electric irons, rice warmers, and even electric water \npumps.  Even though these appliances were seldom immediately available, the survey showed \nthat  households  seek  to  accumulate  electricity-dependent  assets  over  time,  even  where \nhouseholds remained income poor. \n \n3.  While it will not guarantee a more productive local economy, electrification is a major \neconomic building block.  Project activity is justified where development is lagging or held back \nby lack of power. Even if only small direct benefits accrue to the poor, the indirect benefits of \neconomic growth and jobs will benefit all persons in the beneficiary area, including the poor. \nPriority will be given to connect not only households but also small businesses and community \nsocial and economic facilities, including education and health facilities that also serve the poor. \n \nB.  Electricity Access in Project Areas \n4.  Electrification in Indonesia over the past few decades has been impressive: (i) State \nElectricity Enterprise (PLN) has significantly penetrated rural areas and has a high degree of \nrecognition  (even  in  nonelectrified  villages),  and  (ii)  it  considers  connecting  more  villages \n(extension)  as  more  important  than  connecting  more  customers  within  already-connected \nvillages (intensification).  \n \n5.  The district-level data is not readily available, but data from the village potential survey \n(potensi desa  [PODES]), which asks village officials if electricity is available, may be used. \nTable A10.1 shows the percentage of electrified villages in the core subproject areas.  \n \nTable A10.1: Villages with State Electricity Enterprise (PLN) Electricity  \n(%) \n \nCore Subproject  Province  District  Electrified Villages \nMerasap  West Kalimantan  Sambas  86.1 \nLobong  North Sulawesi   Bolong Mongandow  97.4 \nMongango  Gorontalo  Gorontalo  88.4 \nNdungga  Nusa Tenggara Timur  Ende  51.7 \nSource: PODES, 2000.  \n \n                                                 \n28  Insan Hitawasana Sejahtera.

Data on household access from 1996-2000 was taken from National Socioeconomic \nSurvey (SUSENAS), which is broken down into province and district levels (Table A10.2). While \nsome district-level figures fluctuate randomly due to the small samples, progress made, as well \nas relative deficiencies, in several project regions are evident. \n \nTable A10.2: Households Using State Electricity Enterprise (PLN) Electricity  \n(%) \n \nProvince/District  1996  1997  1998  1999  2000 \nWest Kalimantan   44.6  56.9  59.7  59.8  63.7 \n   Sambas  58.0  69.4  71.4  78.4  81.8 \nNorth Sulawesi  71.9  77.7  78.4  81.6  83.9 \n   Bolong Mongandow  74.5  83.3  82.3  86.8  86.0 \n   Gorontalo  33.4  42.8  43.3  48.2  53.4 \nNusa Tenggara Timur  23.6  25.7  34.6  35.9  32.3 \n   Ende  40.6  51.2  50.3  56.3  57.6 \nSource: National Socioeconomic Survey (SUSENAS) Core. \n \n7.  How access is distributed among different population groups, particularly how poor \nhouseholds fare relative to the better-off, is important to observe. The data in 1996-2000 was \nanalyzed and, as expected, the poor are less likely to have electricity, although, at least at the \nnational and broad regional levels, gaps are narrowing. Where overall coverage is higher, most \nnew connections go to poor households if only because most of the rich are already connected. \nThe poor are thus likely to gain greater access due to intensification in already-served areas, as \nwell as due to system expansion in isolated rural areas, which are less developed and have a \nhigher proportion of poor than less remote areas. \n \nC.  Affordability and Real Demand for Electricity \n8.  Many persons think they should not have to pay more than a certain percentage of their \nincome for a certain (minimum basic) standard of power supply\u2014say 4\u20135% of income for 20-30 \nkilowatt-hour  (kWh)  per  month.    A  study  under  the  Asian  Development  Bank  technical \nassistance loan29 used data from SUSENAS consumption and expenditure modules of 1996 \n(precrisis) and 1999 (postcrisis) to show that rural households near the poverty line could afford \n(in 1999 prices) about Rp11,000, and urban households, about Rp15,000 per month, or around \nRp400/kWh for a lifeline supply of 30 kWh. \n \nD.  Poverty Impact Analysis \n9.  The Project's poverty impact was derived from the economic and financial analysis. The \ndomestic price numeraire and the discount rate of 12% were used. Table A10.3 shows the \ndistribution  of  project  effects  (economic  minus  financial  present  values)  among  the \nstakeholders. The resource savings will initially accrue to PLN and the Government, then \ntransferred to outer island consumers through budget allocations for rural electrification and \ntargeted subsidy for small consumers. The Project will benefit consumers (through a consumer \nsurplus of Rp175.4 billion) and labor (through jobs). The Government, however, will suffer an \neconomic loss due to inefficient resource use associated with domestic market price distortion \nrelative to world prices.  \n \n                                                 \n29  Loan 1674-INO: Capacity Building for Establishment of a Competitive Electricity Market, for $20 million, approved \nin March 1999.

The marginal government expenditure required for project cost \nfinancing accruing to the poor was estimated using the income share of the poor (around 14%) \nin gross domestic product (GDP); 25% of the consumer surplus is assumed to go to the poor, \nbased on the proportion of poor consumers estimated during the project preparation technical \nassistance. Based on the projected rural labor employed by the Project, 15% of the economic \nbenefits accruing to unskilled labor are assumed to go to the poor. The net economic benefit to \nthe poor is estimated at Rp41.6 billion during the Project, and the poverty impact ratio is \nestimated at 26.1%. \n \nTable A10.3: Poverty Impact Ratio of Core Subprojects \n(Rp million) \n \n   Financial  Economic  Difference  Distribution of Project Effects \n   Present  Present    PLN  Consumers Government/  Labor   \n Item  Values  Values        Economy    Total \nBenefits  95,507  270,869  175,362            \nCosts                  \n  Capital Costs  (105,659)  (98,358)  7,300      3,074  1,825    \n  O&M Costs  (10,747)  (13,453)  (2,706)      (997)  692    \nNet Present Value  (20,898)  159,058  179,956               \nGains and Losses    (20,898)  175,362  2,077  2,517   159,058 \nProportion of poor (%)    14  25  14  15    \nBenefits to poor    (2,926)  43,840   291  378   41,583  \nPoverty Impact Ratio (%)    26.1          \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n ", "52  Appendix  11 \nREPORT OF SUMMARY INITIAL ENVIRONMENTAL EXAMINATION \n \nA.  Introduction \n1.  The Renewable Energy  Development Sector Project is an environment category B \nproject.  It  includes  core  and  noncore  renewable  energy-based  power  projects  with  a  82-\nmegawatt (MW) total capacity. An initial environmental examination (IEE) was prepared for each \ncore subproject in accordance with the Environmental Assessment Requirements of the Asian \nDevelopment Bank. This sample summary IEE (SIEE) includes major findings and conclusions \nof the Ndungga mini hydropower plant in Flores and was prepared for analytical purposes to \nshow the nature of the Project, its likely potential impacts, and possible mitigation measures \nneeded. \n \nB.  Description of the Subproject \n2.  The Ndungga mini hydropower power project is on Flores Island, East Nusa Tenggara \nProvince. Only 20 kilovolt (kV) distribution systems exist in and around the main localities of \nFlores, and no major power generation facilities. Consumers are supplied from 42 diesel power \nplants scattered through almost all municipalities, and two mini hydropower plants\u2014Bajawa, Ogi \n(0.16 megawatt [MW]) and Ruteng, Waigarit (0.12 MW). \n \n3.  The proposed site of Ndungga is in Ende Regency, Ndungga village, Ndona district, in \nthe catchments of the Wolowona River, which is along the Ende-Maumere regency road. The \ndistance from Ende to Maumere is about 120.0 kilometer (km), and from Ndungga to Ende, 13.0 \nkm by paved road and 0.5 km by walking track. \n \n4.  The designed discharge of Ndungga is 3.7 cubic meters per second, with a net head of \n61 meters. The installed capacity will be 2 x 0.95 MW. The power plant will feed into the nearby \n20 kV distribution line connected to the load center of Ende. \n \nC.  Description of the Environment \n5.  Flores is one of four major islands in the northern arc of Nusa Tenggara, which is \nvolcanic in origin. The volcanic soil of the northern arc is fertile, although some is too ashy and \nporous to hold water well, while some has become weathered and infertile. In the east, the lack \nof rain renders soil less productive than it might otherwise be. The alluvial plains of the north, \nbuilt up by river sediments, are generally fertile. The island has few permanent watercourses, \nwith rivers and streambeds filling up and disappearing as and when the rains come. \n6.  Nusa Tenggara has distinctive fauna. The Komodo dragon, for example, the world\u2019s \nlargest  lizard,  is  found  in  western  Flores.  Another  56  animal  species  are  thought  to  be \nindigenous, and many are endangered. Vegetation is sparse. \n   \n7.  Flores has few modern industries or commercially valuable natural resources. Most \npersons rely on fishing or subsistence agriculture. Tourism is rapidly growing in Lombok and \nMaumere. \n \nD.  Screening of Potential Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n8.  The Ndungga mini hydropower subproject sits on the Wolowona River. The Ndungga \ncatchment area is 164 square kilometer. In general, the Wolowona's physical and chemical \n ", "  Appendix  11  53 \nwater conditions almost satisfy the water quality standard for category B (may be used as raw \nwater for drinking water) set out in the decree of the Minister of State for the Population and \nEnvironment (Kep-02/MENKLH/1/1988). The use of the water for hydropower generation will not \naffect the water quality of Wolowona River. \n \n9.  According to the 1994 general plan of regional planning of Ende Regency, the land for \nNdungga is zoned for cultivation, so no conflict in land use will arise. Based on field data, the \nland of the project area and its surroundings is used for plantations and gardening by local \npersons. A part of it is unused state land. \n \n10.  No protected flora  and  fauna  exist  around  Ndungga.  No  significant  impacts  on  the \nenvironment  are  expected.  Seventeen  families  will  be  affected  and  land  acquisition  and \ncompensation have been settled with them. The local persons hope Ndungga will raise their \nstandard of living either during construction or at project completion. \n \n11.  The protection of catchment of a hydropower plant is important for the environment and \nplant operation. Local villagers could be contracted to help manage and patrol the catchment \nafter being trained in watershed management.  \n \nE.  Institutional Requirement and Environmental Monitoring Program \n12.  The environmental investigations made clear that only very minor environmental impacts \nare expected. The proposed institutional requirement and environmental monitoring activities for \nthe Project are compiled in Table A11. \n \nTable A11: Recommended Activities for Institutional Requirement \nand Environmental Monitoring Program \n \nActivities  Responsibility for  Assistance or \nExecution  Approval by \n1  Training sessions for key personnel of the  Environmental expert or  Internationally \nPLN planning department to address  scientist on behalf of PLN  experienced \n-  basics of environmental protection;  consultant, \n-  methodology and procedures of EIAs;   local university \n-  environment-friendly planning and   \nselection of sites and right of way for \nelectrification projects \n2   Assistance in detailed project planning  Environmental expert or  Local authorities \nactivities, especially for site surveys and  experienced engineer on \npreparation of project civil works  behalf of PLN \n3  Conflict management of land acquisition  Social development  Local authorities \nprocedures  expert on behalf of PLN   \n4  Establishment of an environmental  Environmental experts  Local authorities, \nmonitoring program   (e.g., biologist, chemist)  local university \n-  for project construction phase,  on behalf of PLN \n-  for the first 2 years from start-up of   \nproject operation \n \n ", "54  Appendix  11 \nActivities  Responsibility for  Assistance or \nExecution  Approval by \n5  Supervision of project construction phase to  Environmental expert or  Independent local \nensure environment-friendly execution  experienced engineer on  environmental expert / \nbehalf of PLN  engineer in \ncollaboration with local \nauthorities \n6  Bimonthly preparation of environmental  Environmental expert or  Local authorities \nstatus reports during project construction   engineer on behalf of PLN \n7  Preparation of progress reports of  Environmental expert or  Local authorities \nenvironmental monitoring (two per year) for  engineer on behalf of PLN  \nfirst 2 years of project operation \n8  Establishment of an environmental  Environmental expert or  Local authorities, \nmanagement program for   engineer on behalf of PLN  local university \n-  subproject selection,  \n-  environmental review of subproject \nimplementation \nEIA = environmental impact assessment, PLN = State Electricity Enterprise \n \nF.   Findings and Recommendations \n13.  The IEE findings show that Ndungga, by virtue of its limited construction requirements, \nwill have a neutral, or only very small, influence on the environment. Starting with these \nenvironmental impacts, PLN will incorporate mitigation proposals and recommendations for \nimplementation in the later project phases. \n \nG.  Conclusions \n14.  The proposed core subprojects will have limited significant environmental impacts. A full-\nscale environmental impact assessment is not required. Appropriate mitigation measures and a \nmonitoring  plan  and  their  implementation  arrangements  have  been  proposed,  and  an \nappropriate budget has been allocated in the project cost.  \n \n15.  Development of renewable energy will reduce carbon dioxide emission from the use of \nfossil fuels for power generation and reduce global warming. Contracting local persons to help \nmanage the watershed will create jobs, raise public awareness of resource reservation, help \nprotect the environment, and promote regional development. \n ", "  Appendix  12  55 \nSUMMARY OF SOCIAL SAFEGUARD STRATEGY \n \nA.  Background \n1.  The Renewable  Energy Development Sector Project includes the implementation of \nvarious subprojects across Indonesia involving the construction of small and mini hydropower \nplants,  and  construction  and  upgrading  of  transmission  (70  kilovolt  [kV]  and  below)  and \ndistribution  systems.  Four  core  subprojects,  representative  of  the  intervention  types  and \nregions, have been prepared. All entail land acquisition and resettlement (LAR), and one also \naffects  indigenous  peoples.  Seven  noncore  subprojects  were  identified  and  are  under \npreparation. Additional subprojects will be identified after loan approval and prepared during \nproject implementation. Land impacts are expected to be small or medium.  \n \nB.  General  Policy  and  Procedures  for  Land  Acquisition  and  Resettlement  and \nIndigenous Peoples \n2.  LAR will be handled in accordance to national law and the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) involuntary resettlement policy as detailed in the Handbook on Resettlement: A Guide to \nGood Practice. The ADB indigenous peoples policy will guide subprojects. LAR preparation \nrequires (i) a common compensation policy framework and procedural guidelines (CPFPG) for \nall  subprojects;  and  (ii)  individual  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  plans  (LARPs)  for \nsubprojects. Sector projects require an indigenous peoples policy framework (IPPF) and specific \nindigenous peoples development plans (IPDPs) for subprojects affecting indigenous people. \nThe preparation of a CPFPG, IPPF, LARPs, and IPDPs for the core subprojects was a condition \nfor project appraisal. LARPs and IPDPs, based on the detailed design and acceptable to ADB, \nwill be a condition for financing the noncore subprojects.  \n   \n3.  To meet these requirements, State Electricity Enterprise (PLN) has prepared a CPFPG, \nan IPPF, three LARPs, and one LARP with IPDP covering the four core subprojects. These \ndocuments were complemented by an initial social assessment (ISA) providing preliminary \nimpacts data for all known noncore subprojects and by a social assessment. The following \nsummarizes CPFPG, IPPF, core subproject LARPs, and noncore subproject impact data. \n   \n4.  The  noncore  subprojects  will  be  prepared  after  loan  approval.  Adequate  social \ndevelopment  capacity,  inclusive  of  LARP  and  IPDP  preparation,  will  be  injected  into  the \npostappraisal phases, which will include providing sufficient social development expertise in the \nconsulting services for the sector project implementation consultant. \n \nC.  Land Acquisition and Resettlement  \n1.  Compensation Policy Framework and Procedural Guidelines  \n5.  The  CPFPG  reflect  the  main  project  preparation  and  implementation  principles:  (i) \nnegative impacts will be minimized; (ii) compensation will be sufficient to improve or at least \nrestore the preproject income and living standards of affected persons; (iii) affected persons will \nbe fully informed and consulted on compensation options and resettlement planning; (iv) asset \ncompensation  will  be  provided  at  replacement  rates;  and  (v)  lost  asset  compensation, \nreplacement dwellings, and rehabilitation provisions and allowances will be provided in full \nbefore ground leveling and demolition. ADB approval of a noncore subproject involving LARP \nwill be subject to ADB's approval of the LARP. \n   \n ", "56  Appendix  12 \n6.  The CPFPG also stipulate eligibility and entitlements for land, houses, income losses, \nand rehabilitation subsidies as follows:   \n(i)  Permanent agricultural and residential land losses will be compensated in cash \nat market rates. \n(ii)  Temporary land losses will be paid in cash at market rates. \n(iii)  House and building losses will be compensated in cash at replacement rates, \nfree of demolition expenses and salvaged materials. \n(iv)  Crop losses will be paid to the affected persons in cash at market rates. \n(v)  Relocation  expenses  covering  transport  costs  will  be  paid  to  the  affected \npersons. \n(vi)  Business loss allowance based on tax declarations will be paid to each affected \npersons for each month of interruption of business activities. \n \n7.  As for LAR processing procedures, the CPFPG establish the following:  \n(i)  After subproject identification and completion of preliminary design, PLN will \ncarry out an ISA to determine preliminary impact data and the socioeconomic \nfeatures of the affected persons.  \n(ii)  If through this process, subproject impacts are identified as \u201csignificant,\u201d30 a full \nLARP will be prepared.  \n(iii)  If, however, the impacts are identified as less than \u201csignificant,\u201d only a short \nLARP will be prepared.31  \n \n2.  Institutional Responsibilities \n8.  The  sector  project  director,  through  the  social  development  unit,  has  the  overall \nsupervision, review, and financial responsibility for LAR. The subproject teams will prepare and \nimplement specific LARPs and share responsibility with local administrations for LAR, including \nasset valuation; consultation; entitlement delivery; and issuance of land acquisition, demolition, \nand building permits. Field tasks such as paying compensation, selecting replacement land, and \nproviding livelihood support will rest with village and local PLN personnel. \n \n3.  Disclosure and Public Consultation  \n9.  LARP  preparation  will  entail  intense  consultation  with  affected  families  through \nquestionnaires and community meetings involving the families and local subproject team and \ngovernments. A booklet summarizing the CPFPG will be sent to all affected families, and \nBahasa Indonesia CPFPG and LARPs will be made available in each affected village. The \nsame documents in English will be posted on ADB's web site and made available at the \nIndonesia Resident Mission in Jakarta. Information booklets for subprojects in areas where \nindigenous peoples live will be compiled in the local languages. \n \n4.  Grievance Procedures \n10.  Grievances will first be lodged with the villages. If no settlement is reached within 2 \nweeks, complaints can be raised to the land acquisition committee for the relevant district \n(established by presidential order). If still unresolved, outstanding cases can be sent to the \n                                                 \n30  Significant impacts are (i) 200 or more affected persons and (ii) 100 or more indigenous people or vulnerable \ngroups and affected persons.  \n31  For full and short LARP formats, see Handbook on Resettlement: A Guide to Good Practice. \n ", "  Appendix  12  57 \noffice of the head of local government. Final appeal for unsolved cases will be available in the \nappropriate courts of law. \n \n5.  Monitoring and Evaluation \n11.  The LARP will be internally and externally monitored. PLN has established a monthly \nreporting system involving the social development staff with the sector project director and in the \nregional subproject teams. External monitoring will be assigned to an independent monitoring \nagency. PLN will report to ADB on the LARP in quarterly progress reports. External monitoring \nreports will be submitted to ADB twice a year, detailing the progress in implementing each \nLARP until its conclusion. At the end of the implementation of subproject, the independent \nmonitoring agency will prepare a report evaluating the results of the whole resettlement program \nand assessing affected families rehabilitation and satisfaction. \n \n6.  Finances \n12.  Each LARP will establish unit compensation rates for items negatively affected by the \nsubproject and will provide a detailed budget for LAR compensation. The budget will include (i) \nland compensation, resettlement subsidies, and house improvement or replacement; (ii) income \nrestoration assistance; (iii) relocation allowances; (iv) management costs; (v) monitoring and \nevaluation; (vi) taxes; and (vii) contingency. Cost estimates will be adjusted annually based on \nthe inflation rate of the preceding year. Total cost of the resettlement program for the core \nsubprojects has been estimated at Rp6.5 billion. Cost estimates for the noncore subprojects will \nbe included in the respective LARPs. \n \nD.  Core and Noncore Subproject Land Acquisition and Resettlement Plans \n1.  Core Subprojects \n13.  The four  core subprojects are mini hydropower plants in Merasap, West Kalimantan; \nLobong,  Gorontalo;  Mongango,  North  Sulawesi;  and  Ndungga,  East  Nusa  Tengara.  They \nrequire short LARPs, which reflect the stipulation of the CPFPG and provide information on \ncompensation  rates,  consultation  activities,  and  budgets.  Core  subproject  LAR  impacts, \nincluding affected persons, houses, land, and relative compensation costs, are summarized \nbelow.  \n \n(i)  Merasap.  LAR  compensation  was  paid  in  1996,  and  the land acquired is \nunoccupied. ADB reviewed the process and found it acceptable. A full LARP \nsummary indicates that the subproject will acquire 5.5 hectares (ha) of farmland. \nNo houses will be affected and no resettlement will be necessary. The subproject \nalso  compensated  the  loss  of  2,037  trees.  Five  families  (29  persons)  were \naffected. The LARP amounted to Rp41 million in 1997. The local community and \nPLN have agreed on a community development plan for an estimated Rp2.3 \nbillion. \n(ii)  Lobong. A short LARP indicates that 5.2 ha of farmland will be acquired. The \nsubproject required removal of one temporary house and 7,193 trees. Twelve \nfamilies (51 persons) were affected. The LARP has been assessed at Rp972 \nmillion.   \n(iii)  Mongango. A short LARP indicates that 9.1 ha of farmland will be acquired. One \npermanent and four temporary houses, and 1,040 trees will be removed. Thirty \n ", "58  Appendix  12 \nfamilies (177 persons) were affected. The LARP has been assessed at Rp904 \nmillion. \n(iv)  Ndungga. A short LARP indicates that 6.1 ha of farmland will be acquired. One \ntemporary house and 443 trees will be removed. Sixteen families (89 persons) \nwill be affected. The LARP is estimated at Rp2.3 billion. \n \n2.  Noncore Subprojects \n14.  The LARPs for the identified noncore subprojects are in various stages of preparation. \nThe ISA estimating negative impacts has been prepared for all. Except for the small hydropower \nplants, short LARPs will be required for the noncore subprojects.  \n \nE.  Indigenous Peoples  \n15.  A few subprojects will affect indigenous communities. Some are relatively well integrated \ninto Indonesian society and culture, while others, especially in Papua, sharply differ in race, \nculture, society, and political organization from the national mainstream. These differences have \nbeen carefully factored into project activities to ensure compliance with the ADB indigenous \npeoples policy.  \n   \n16.  General indigenous people policy and procedural provisions are developed in an IPPF. \nSpecific subproject issues will be dealt with through an IPDP based on intensive participatory \nplanning. Depending on the impact\u2019s gravity and the degree of indigenous people's vulnerability, \nthe  IPDP  will  either  be  included  in  the  subproject  LARPs  or  prepared  as  a  stand-alone \ndocument. One core subproject (Merasap) will affect  indigenous people. For the identified \nnoncore subprojects in Papua, the preparation of individual IPDPs will be a condition for ADB \nfinancing.  Community  infrastructure  that  may  be  provided  by  an  IPDP  will  have  to  be \nconstructed before the land needed by the subproject is acquired. \n \n1.  Indigenous People Policy Framework \n17.  The IPPF provides a general introduction to indigenous people issues for the Project, \noutlines the criteria established by the ADB policy, identifies indigenous people, and provides an \noverview of indigenous communities to be or likely to be affected by the Project. The IPPF also \nsets the policy and procedural framework relevant for the Project as a whole; outlines the \ncontent of a model IPDP; and describes the strategy to be followed in defining different IPDP \ntypes fitting the degree of impact intensity and relative vulnerability of affected communities. \n   \n18.  As for the indigenous people identification criteria, the IPPF establishes that indigenous \npeople are those who in various degrees (i) descend from groups present in specific areas \nbefore the establishment of modern states and relative borders, and (ii) maintain distinct self- or \nnon-self-ascribed identities. Other identification criteria will be used to establish the degree of \nvulnerability of affected indigenous people and the type of action to be developed for an IPDP: \n(i) use of distinct languages; (ii) active maintenance of sociocultural systems and institutions that \ndiffer from the sociocultural system and institutional-political tradition of dominant societies; (iii) \npursuit of livelihood in the margins of the market system; and (vi) maintenance of unique ties \nand attachments to natural resources and ancestral territories. \n \n19.  The IPPF establishes that IPDP interventions for affected indigenous people will have to \n(i) reflect local culture, beliefs, needs, and preferred options of affected communities; (ii) reflect \nthe outcome of participatory planning methodologies; (iii) consider traditional procedures and \n ", "  Appendix  12  59 \nfunctions of local institutions; (iv) fit local production systems; (v) promote self-reliance among \nthe affected communities; and  (vii) ensure that adequate lead time and arrangements are \nestablished for IPDP implementation. \n \n20.  The IPPF establishes that IPDPs will be prepared by specialists familiar with indigenous \npeople  issues  and  with  anthropological  and  sociological  expertise.  IPDPs  will  include  the \nfollowing: \n \n(i)  an indigenous people identification assessment (IPIA) extensively describing (a) \nthe affected community, identifying the name of the indigenous people; (b) type \nand magnitude of direct and indirect impacts; (c) number of households and \npersons affected; (d) social organization; (e) livelihood and land tenure patterns; \n(f) history of relations with outsiders (including eventual transmigrasi [migrating] \ncommunities); (g) degree of adaptation to mainstream society and culture; and \n(h) local political forms and degree of participation into formal state administration \nmechanisms;  \n(ii)  an assessment of (a) the degree of vulnerability of the affected  indigenous \npeople communities and of the type of IPDP needed based on the ISA and type \nof physical impacts of a subproject; (b) IPDP implementation capacity of affected \ncommunities, local government, and subproject teams; and, if necessary, (c) a \ncapacity-building plan to reinforce IPDP implementation; \n(iii)  a thorough participatory planning exercise (to be documented in the IPDP text) \ninvolving affected communities, local governments, subproject teams, and the \nPLN social development unit; and  \n(iv)  a community development action plan (CDAP) (a) formally endorsed by the \naffected  communities  and  reflecting  the  results  of  the  ISA  and  participatory \nplanning  activities;  and  (b)  detailing  needed  IPDP  provisions,  organization \nframework, monitoring schemes, and specific IPDP implementation schedules \nand budgets. \n \n21.  IPDP type and initiatives will be commensurate to the variety of indigenous people \naffected by the subproject, to their degree of vulnerability, and to the type of impacts: \n  \n(i)  The IPDP will be limited only to the IPIA and will not require a specific a CDAP if \n(a)  negative  impacts  affect  indigenous  people  who  are  fully  integrated  in \nmainstream  society  and  culture  and  are  fully  in  control  of  the  national \nadministrative  system,  and  (b)  impacts  do  not  have  specific  sociocultural \ndimensions. The IPDP in this case will be included as a chapter in the LARP. \n(ii)  The IPDP will include with the IPIA directions to compensate affected persons as \nneeded  if  (a)  negative  impacts  affect  IP  groups  maintaining  a  degree  of \nsociocultural  and  institutional  distinction  from  mainstream  society;  and  (b) \nimpacts carry a sociocultural dimension but do not have broad community effects \n(i.e.,  the  houses  to  be  reconstructed  are  of  a  specific  traditional  type,  or \ncompensation needs to follow specific traditional procedures). The IPDP will be \nincluded as a chapter in the LARP. \n(iii)  The IPDP will include an IPIA and CDAP and will be prepared as a stand-alone \ndocument  if  (a)  negative  impacts  affect  IP  groups  maintaining  a  degree  of \nsociocultural  and  institutional  distinction  from  mainstream  society,  and  (b) \nimpacts not only carry a sociocultural dimension but also have broad community \neffects. A stand-alone IPDP will also cover LARP issues. If whole communities \nhold land tenure collectively, the IPDP may include special land compensation \n ", "60  Appendix  12 \nfeatures involving direct provisions for land users and generalized provisions, in \nthe form of community development packages, for what concerns communal land \nproperty. \n \n2.  Core and Noncore Subprojects  \n22.  One core subproject, Merasap (West Kalimantan), impacts on indigenous people, whose \nissues are addressed in a LARP chapter. The indigenous people are Dayak villagers who are \nrelatively well integrated into the broader administrative system. Therefore, no stand-alone IPDP \nwill be prepared. The LARP contains a chapter on indigenous people, indicating the features of \nthe local sociocultural situation and detailing a number of specific interventions requested by the \naffected  community:  rehabilitation  and  improvement  of  a  Christian  sanctuary  and  the \nconstruction of a wall to protect the cave where the sanctuary is from eventual floods. \n \n23.  Four  noncore  subprojects  in  Papua  (Tatui,  Amai,  Prafi,  and  Genyem)  will  involve \nindigenous people. Considering local sociocultural features and the specific claims on local land \nand natural resources held by the Papua communities under the new autonomous province \nstatus,  these  subprojects  will  require  the  preparation  of  stand-alone  IPDPs.  For  these \nsubprojects the consultation process leading to the conceptualization of the IPDPs has been \ninitiated. \n \n \n \n \n \n "], "metadata": {"Creator": "R325-02 - Microsoft Word", "CreationDate": "D:20021129110520Z", "Title": "R325-02", "Author": "rsa", "Producer": "Acrobat PDFWriter 4.0 for Windows NT", "ModDate": "D:20030205151629+08'00'"}, "author_page": " \nWEIGHTS AND MEASURES \n \n  GWh (gigawatt-hour)  \u2013  unit of energy, equal to 1 million kWh \n  km (kilometer)  \u2013  unit of distance  \n  kV (kilovolt)  \u2013  unit of voltage, equal to 1,000 volts \n  kVA (kilovolt-ampere)  \u2013  unit of connected load or apparent power \n  kWh (kilowatt-hour)  \u2013  unit of energy, equal to 1,000 Wh \n  MVA (megavolt-ampere)  \u2013  unit of apparent power \n  MW (megawatt)  \u2013  unit of power, equal to 1 million watts  \n  TWh (terawatt-hour)  \u2013  unit of energy, equal to 1 billion kWh \n \nNOTES \n \nIn this report, \"$\" refers to US dollars.  \n \n \n \n \nThis report was prepared by a team consisting of: A.
