Its 103,000 people inhabit about 36 of these islands. The peak demand \nof  the  four  Tonga  Power  Limited  (TPL)  grids  in  2016  was  about  11.1  megawatts,  and  yearly \ndemand  totaled  about  55  gigawatt-hours. 2  An  estimated  13  million  liters  of  diesel  were \nconsumed  to generate this  electricity  at  a  cost that  was equivalent to  about  10%  of the  year\u2019s \ntotal  gross  domestic  product  and  about  15%  of  the  total  value  of  imports.  Peak  demand  is \nexpected to increase to 17.2 megawatts by 2020. Petroleum dependency makes Tonga highly \nvulnerable  to  oil  price  shocks,  which  affect  the  affordability  of  food,  goods,  electricity,  and \ntransport. \n \nThe  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  approved  the  original  Outer  Island  Renewable \n4. \nEnergy  Project  on  27  June  2013  to  reduce  Tonga\u2019s  dependence  on  imported  fossil  fuel  for \npower generation and give consumers greater access at a reduced cost to electricity generated \nby solar power. The original project became effective in June 2014. The original project planned \nto (i) construct and install solar power systems with a total capacity of 1.32 megawatt-peak; (ii) \nprovide  operation  and  maintenance  training  and  knowledge  transfer  to  the  implementing \nagencies for at least 5 years after commissioning of the solar systems, including development of \na program manual for operation and maintenance of solar generation and distribution systems; \nand (iii) assist the implementing agencies to implement the project in an efficient and effective \nmanner by recruiting project management consultants for at least 5 years after commissioning \nof the solar systems. \n \nThe  original  project  encountered  initial  implementation  delays  for  a  variety  of  reasons, \n5. \nincluding  significant  damage  caused  by  the  most  powerful  storm  ever  recorded  in  Tonga. 3 \nFollowing the devastation caused when Cyclone Ian passed directly over the northeast islands \nof  Ha\u2019apai  in  January  2014,  the  government  requested  a  temporary  suspension  of  project \nactivities so that it could focus on emergency assistance needed to reconstruct and strengthen \nthe  damaged  electricity  network  and  school facilities  on  the  island group.  After  ADB  approved \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. ADB. 2013. Report and Recommendation of the President \nto the Board of Directors: Proposed Grant and Administration of Grant to the Kingdom of Tonga for the Outer Island \nRenewable Energy Project. Manila. \n\n2  TPL  is  a  vertically  integrated  government-owned  public  enterprise  under  the  oversight  of  the  Ministry  of  Public \n\nEnterprises and the government\u2019s cabinet.  \n\n3  Cyclone  Ian  was  a  category  5  system,  with  winds  of more  than  200 kilometers  per  hour and  gusts  of  about 300 \nkilometers  per  hour.  About  5,000  people  were  directly  affected\u201466%  of  Ha\u2019apai\u2019s  population.  According  to TPL, \nthe cyclone damaged 90% of the Ha\u2019apai power network\u2019s distribution lines, 40% of the high-voltage poles, 70% of \nthe low-voltage poles, 65% of the transformers, 90% of the transformer structures, one of the two generators, and \n95% of the streetlights. \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nthe  Cyclone  Ian  Recovery  Project  in May  2014, activities on  the  original project resumed,  and \nthe  government  requested  ADB\u2019s  support  to  rehabilitate  TPL\u2019s  power  distribution  system  on \n\u2018Eua and Vava\u2019u. 4   \n \nThe  power  distribution  system  (grid)  is  part  of  the  electricity  supply  chain  and  requires \n6. \nconsiderable  investment  and  operation  and  maintenance  efforts.  Power  distribution  assets \ntypically represent 20%\u201330% of the required power system investments in electricity industries \nworldwide,  but  this  figure  rises  to  about  42%  for  TPL.  The  standard  losses  in  rural  power \ndistribution networks are generally about 5%, yet the rate is more than twice as high in Tonga at \naround  13%.  Greater  losses  mean  that  more  fuel  is  consumed  in  power  generation,  which \nmakes improving the efficiency of the country\u2019s power system a matter of paramount importance \nfor the government. \n \n7. \nTo address dual challenges of reducing high technical losses and incorporating climate \nresilience features for the grids in the outer islands of Tonga, ADB approved the first additional \nfinancing  on  20  October  2015,  which  became  effective  on  30  November  2015.  Under  the  first \nadditional financing, 80% of the existing grid network on \u2018Eua and 20% of existing grid network \non  Vava\u2019u  are  being  rehabilitated  and  upgraded. 5 The  current  project, 6   especially  the  grid-\nrehabilitation  component,  will  allow  Tonga  to  reduce  power  distribution  losses  and  fuel \nconsumption  while  delivering  the  same  amount  of  electricity  to  consumers;  and  improve  the \nclimate  resilience  feature  of  TPL\u2019s  grids.  This  will  be  achieved  by  rehabilitating  old  and \ninefficient grid assets, i.e., cables, poles, distribution transformers, and switchgears.  \n \n8. \nTo  expand  the  scale  of  the  current  project  and  deliver  increased  benefits  by  reducing \npower distribution losses, the government has asked ADB for a loan and a grant of $2.5 million \neach from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds (Asian  Development  Fund) resources7 to  expand  the  ongoing \ngrid network upgrading and rehabilitation works in (i) \u2018Eua from 80% to 100% of the existing grid \nnetwork; and (ii) Vava\u2019u from 20% to 50% of the existing grid network.8 \n \n9. \nThe  current  project  meets  all  the  eligibility  criteria  for  additional  financing.  Despite  the \ndelays, the progress made on project implementation since effectiveness has been satisfactory \noverall.  The  project  currently  faces  no  major  risks  to  a  successful  delivery  of  its  expected \noutputs  or  to  keeping  to  its  revised  implementation  schedule.  As  of  September  2016,  (i) \ncumulative contract awards for the current project is at $9.8 million, or 80.0% of ADB financing; \nand  (ii)  cumulative  disbursements  for  the  current  project  has  reached  $4.3  million,  or  30%  of \nADB financing. The current project has also conducted all necessary safeguards due diligence \n\n                                                \n4  ADB.  2014.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors:  Proposed  Grant  and \nAdministration of Grant to the Kingdom of Tonga for the Cyclone Ian Recovery Project. Manila. Overall progress of \nrehabilitating the electricity network on Ha\u2019apai has been satisfactory. \n\n5  ADB.  2015.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors:  Proposed  Grant  and \nAdministration of Grant for Additional Financing to the Kingdom of Tonga for the Outer Island Renewable Energy \nProject. Manila. ADB and the Second Danish Cooperation Fund for Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency for \nRural Areas  provided $2.19 million and the European Union provided \u20ac3.00 million, all on a grant basis. TPL will \nprovide $0.67 million as an in-kind contribution. \n\n6  The current project includes the original project and the first additional financing. \n7  A  country's  eligibility  for  Asian  Development  Fund  (Special  Fund  resources)  grants  under  ADB\u2019s  revised  grant \nframework is determined by its risk of debt distress. The latest debt sustainability analysis in 2014 determined that \nTonga had a high risk of debt distress and was therefore eligible to receive  50:50 of its Asian Development Fund \nallocation as a loan and a grant. \n\n8  The first additional financing only covers 80% of existing grid networks on \u2018Eua and 20% of existing grid networks \non Vava\u2019u due to the limited Asian Development Fund allocation for Tonga in 2015. In early 2016, the government \nrequested  to  allocate  some  remaining  2016  Asian  Development  Fund  allocation  to  expand  the  project  scope  on \nboth islands. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n3 \n\nand is noted to be in compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). Since the third \nquarter  of  2015,  the  current  project  has  been  rated  on  track  in  the  project  performance  rating \nsystem and is, therefore, considered to be a well-performing project.9 Project performance and \nassociated issues are described in more detail in the summary of project performance.10 \n \n10. \nThe  additional  financing  is  in  line  with  the  objectives  of  ADB\u2019s  2009  Energy  Policy  to \npromote energy efficiency and renewable energy; provide access to energy for all; and support \nreform,  capacity  building,  and  improved  governance  in  the  energy  sector.11 It  is  included  in \nADB\u2019s  Tonga  draft  Country  Operations  Business  Plan,  2017\u20132019,  which  makes  energy  a \npriority  area  of  support  and  sets  a  primary  goal  of  reducing  the  country\u2019s  dependence  on \nimported  fossil  fuels  through  energy  efficiency  and  conservation  operations,  including  support \nfor power generation from renewable energy sources. 12 \n \n11. \nThe  overall  project  will  remain  technically,  financially,  and  economically  viable  with  the \nadditional  financing  component.  The  safeguards  categorization  of  the  overall  project  will  also \nremain  unchanged.  The  additional  financing  component  will  enhance  the  current  project\u2019s \noriginal design and add effective support for its development of the solar photovoltaic plants\u2014\none  of  the  government\u2019s  key  priorities.  The  additional  financing  component  will  enhance  the \nimpact and outcome of the project, as well as ADB\u2019s contribution to power sector development \nin Tonga. \n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n12. \nThe impact and outcome of the overall project will remain unchanged with the additional \nfinancing.  The  intended  impact  will  remain  the  reduction  of  Tonga\u2019s  dependence  on  imported \nfossil fuel for power generation. The outcome of the overall project will be the optimization of on-\ngrid  and  off-grid  generation  systems  to  provide  increased  consumer  access  to  electricity \ngenerated by solar power at a reduced cost. \n \nC. \n\nOutputs \n\n13. \nOutput  1  under  the  current  project  is  the  construction  and  installation  of  solar  power \nsystems with a total capacity of 1.32 megawatt-peak on nine outer islands and the rehabilitation \nby TPL of the existing grid network on the islands of Vava\u2019u and \u2018Eua by replacing cables, poles, \ndistribution  transformers,  switchgears,  and  other  equipment.  Under  the  proposed  additional \nfinancing, the rehabilitation by TPL of the existing grid network will be expanded in (i) \u2018Eua from \n80% to 100% of the existing grid network and (ii) Vava\u2019u from 20% to 50% of the existing grid \nnetwork. The current output 2 and output 3 will remain unchanged with the additional financing. \n \nD. \n \n14. \nThe additional financing will be provided through a loan of SDR1.809 million ($2.5 million \nequivalent)  and  a  grant  of  $2.5  million  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources  as  well  as  an \nadditional contribution from TPL of $0.60 million. This will raise investments by about 42% from \n\nInvestment and Financing Plans \n\n                                                \n9 ADB. 2011. Additional Financing. Operations Manual. OM H5/OP.

Any cost overrun or \ncash shortfall will be borne by the Government of Tonga. \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n15. \nThe government  has requested  an  additional (i)  loan in various currencies equivalent  to \nSDR1.809 million, ($2.5 million equivalent); and (ii) grant not exceeding $2.50 million equivalent, \nboth from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources (Asian Development Fund) to help finance the project.13 \nThe loan will have a 32-year term, including a grace period of 8 years, an interest rate of 1.0% per \nannum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter (the interest during construction as \napplicable to be capitalized in the loan), and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft \nfinancing and project agreements.  \n \n16. \nTonga  is  an  Asian  Development  Fund  50:50  (loan:  grant)  eligible  country.  The  grid \nrehabilitation  work  in  outer  islands  is  largely  driven  by  the  government\u2019s  priority  to  (i)  reduce \nTonga\u2019s  fuel  consumption  for  power  generation  by  reducing  technical  losses;  (ii)  improve  the \noverall  climate  resilience  features  of  Tonga\u2019s  power  distribution  network;  and  (iii)  extend  the \nnetwork  rehabilitation  to  remote  parts  of  the  country.  TPL  would  be  unlikely  to  undertake  the \nproposed grid rehabilitation on a commercial basis as it offers only marginal commercial incentive. \nTherefore, the government has decided to provide the loan and grant proceeds to TPL as a grant \nand  will  make the  proceeds  of  the  loan  and  grant  available  to TPL  under  a  subsidiary  financing \nagreement upon terms and conditions satisfactory to ADB.14 The revised financing plan is in Table \n2. \n\n                                                \n13 Additional  Financing  will  cover  the  cost  of  all  works  and  associated  services  for  upgrading  the  existing  power \n\ndistribution networks.  \n\n14 A new subsidiary financing agreement is expected to be signed after approval of the proposed additional financing. \nIn addition to the proposed additional financing, the government also requested for ADB\u2019s funding support of $8.0 \nmillion in grant and loan for TPL\u2019s proposed 6-megawatt solar project development. However, since this will be a \ncommercially driven project, the government will on-lend the entire $8.0 million to TPL as 100% loan. This funding \nis expected to be processed in 2017. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n5 \n\n \n\n26.0 \n\n26.0 \n\n \n\n34.0 \n27.0 \n\nTable 2: Revised Financing Plan \n($ million) \n\nCurrenta \n\nShare of \nTotal \n(%) \n\n  Additional Financing \nShare of \nTotal \n(%) \n\nAmount  \n5.00 \n\n \n\nTotal \n\nAmount  \n8.44 \n\nShare of \nTotal (%) \n44.8 \n\n5.94 \n\n2.50 \n\n4.50 \n3.57 \n\n31.5 \n\n13.3 \n\n23.9 \n19.0 \n\n2.50 \n\n2.50 \n\n \n \n\n \n\n89.2 \n\n44.6 \n\n44.6 \n\n \n \n\n \n\nAmount  \n3.44 \n\n3.44 \n\n \n\n4.50 \n3.57 \n\nSource \nAsian Development Bank  \n     Special Funds resources:     \n     ADF (grant) \n     Special Funds resources:  \n     ADF (loan) \nGovernment of Australiab \nEuropean Unionc \nSecond Danish Cooperation \nFund for Renewable Energy \nand Energy Efficiency for \nRural Areas \nGovernment of Tongad \n\n0.75 \n\n5.7 \n\n0.75 \n\n4.0 \n\n0.97 \n13.23 \n\n7.3 \n100.0 \n\n0.60 \n5.60 \n\n10.7 \n100.0 \n\n1.57 \n18.83 \n\n8.3 \n100.0 \n\nTotal \nADF = Asian Development Fund \na  Refers to the original amount and any previous additional financing. \nb  Administered  by  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB).

The selection of \nequipment has been carefully analyzed based on best engineering practices. The equipment is \nspecifically designed for hard marine environments and remote island conditions. ADB and the \nimplementing  agency  quantified  the  equipment  necessary  for  the  network  refurbishment, \nassessed  the  grid  condition,  and  calculated  the  potential  reduction  in  grid  power  losses.  The \nequipment will incorporate adequate climate-proofing measures to increase resilience to climate \nand disaster risks throughout the project lifecycle. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n7 \n\nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n20. \nThe  proposed  power  distribution  network  to  be  funded  by  the  additional  financing  is \nconsidered  financially  viable  because  the  estimated  financial  internal  rate  of  return  (FIRR)  of \n(4.69%)  is  greater  than  the  weighted  average  cost  of  capital  (WACC)  of  4.13%.  The  overall \nproject is considered to be financially feasible since the FIRR is 4.30%, greater than the WACC \n(3.60%).  The  overall  project  was  financially  feasible  under  all  the  scenarios  tested,  with  the \nFIRR remaining greater than WACC or very close to WACC.16  \n \n21. \nThe  additional  financing  is  also  considered  economically  viable,  since  the  estimated \neconomic  internal  rate  of return  (EIRR)  of 10.39%  is  within the acceptable  level  between 10% \nand  12%,  with  unvalued  benefits  that  are  expected  to  exceed  unvalued  costs.  The  EIRR  of \n12.25%  for  the  overall  project  including  the  proposed  additional  financing  is  greater  than  the \neconomic discount rate of 12%. Under several adverse scenarios during sensitivity testing, the \noverall  project  has  maintained  an  acceptable  level  of  EIRR  between  10%  and  12%  with \nunvalued benefits that are expected to exceed unvalued costs. Thus, the project is considered \neconomically feasible.  \n \nC. \n\nGovernance \n\nFinancial  management.  To  facilitate  cash  flow  during  project  implementation,  the \n22. \nMFNP,  as  the  executing  agency,  will  approve  withdrawal  applications  from  the  project \nmanagement unit and submit them to ADB for direct payment for all project goods, works, and \nconsultancy  services.  A  public  financial  management  performance  assessment  under  the \noriginal  project  concluded  that  Tonga\u2019s  public  financial  management  system  is  based  on  a \nsound legal and regulatory framework and underpinned by a set of well-established expenditure \ncontrol procedures that cover wages and salaries, non-salary items, and procurement.17 \n \nProcurement.  The  project  management  consultant  has  assisted  the  implementing \n23. \nagencies  in  procuring  all  project  goods,  works,  and  services  under  the  current  project. \nProcurement of goods, works, and related services under the additional financing project will be \ncarried out by TPL, in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2015, as amended from \ntime to time). In addition to international competitive bidding,  national competitive bidding, and \nshopping  methods,  direct  contracting  and  force  account  methods  will  be  used  for  some \npackages to be funded by the additional financing. Direct contracting with the existing contractor \nwill  be  used  for  procurement  of  electric  equipment  to  ensure  compatibility  with  the  existing \nequipment,  such  as  cables and  transformers.  Direct contracting will  also minimize  the time for \nthe supply and delivery of equipment and its subsequent installation by TPL. Completion of 20% \nof the remaining works will ensure the timely commissioning of the grid to supply power to the \npopulation  of  the  outer  islands.  The  proposed  additional  grant  and  loan  will  finance  the \nincremental  labor  costs  of  TPL  to  carry  out  construction  and  rehabilitation  of  high-voltage  and \nlow-voltage  power  distribution  network  on  \u2018Eua  and  Vava\u2019u  islands.  The  force  account  is \nproposed because the number of works is small (about $0.40 million) and scattered across the \nislands. TPL has been successfully implementing similar works under previous projects and it is \ncapable  of  carrying  out  the  construction  without  disrupting  the  grid's  functioning.  The  use  of \n\n                                                \n16 While  the  FIRRs  are  below  the WACC  under  a  couple  sensitivity  cases,  the  EIRRs  of  the  overall  project  are  on \n\nfeasible levels, and are considered justified on economic grounds. \n\n17 Government of Tonga. 2010. Public Financial Management Performance Report. Nuku\u2019alofa. \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\ndirect  contracting  and  force  account  has  been  justified  based  on  ADB\u2019s  Procurement \nGuidelines.18 \n \n24. \nAdvance contracting for some packages using international competitive bidding, national \ncompetitive bidding, shopping, and direct contracting methods will be undertaken in conformity \nwith  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2015,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  The  executing \nagency  and  implementing  agencies  have  been  advised  that  approval  of  advance  contracting \ndoes not commit ADB to finance the project. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to \ndate) was explained to and discussed with the government, MFNP, and TPL. The specific policy \nrequirements and supplementary measures are described in the project administration manual. \n \nD. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n25. \nThe primary beneficiaries of the overall project will be the people of the outer islands of \nTonga who will benefit from an alternative, cheap, and reliable means of power supply. They will \ninclude low-income households relying on existing lifeline electricity tariffs. Under the proposed \nadditional financing, the people of \u2018Eua and Vava\u2019u will particularly gain from reliable electricity \nsupply. It is expected to result in more efficient electricity consumption and provide incentives to \nhouseholds  and  local  businesses  to  maximize  power  supply  for  income-generating  and \nproductive  activities.  Provision  of  social  services,  such  as  health  and  education,  are  also \nexpected to improve through consistent power supply. \n \n26. \nRural  women  in  Tonga  perform  multiple  roles  often  with  limited  resources  and \nchallenging  work  environments,  such  as  lack  of  access  to  electricity.  The  provision  of  an \naffordable, reliable power supply to beneficiary households will  enable women to perform their \nroles  more  efficiently.  The  women\u2019s  lack  of  opportunities  for  paid  employment  (51%  women \nemployment  in  \u2018Eua  and  53%  in  Vava\u2019u)  would  also  be  potentially  addressed  by  growth  in \nenterprises dependent on reliable electricity supply and employment opportunities during project \nimplementation.  The  activities  proposed  under  the  additional  financing  will  not  require  any \nchanges  to  the  existing  gender  action  plan  of  the  overall  project,  which  is  categorized  as \neffective  gender  mainstreaming.  The  project  management  consultant  with  the  assistance from \nthe gender focal points from TPL and the Ministry of Meteorology, Energy, Information, Disaster \nManagement,  Climate  Change,  and  Communications  will  continue  to  satisfactorily  implement \nthe  proposed  activities  and  targets  under  the  gender  action  plan. 19  TPL  has  successfully \nbrought  to the  current  project  sites,  8  women  out  of  15  trained workers. Four  of these  women \npreviously completed the same tasks on Ha\u2019apai under the Cyclone Ian Recovery Project. TPL\u2019s \neffort  may  create  a  long-term  employment  opportunity  for  these  female  workers.  The \nimplementation progress of the gender action plan will continue to be reported quarterly to ADB \nand the government.  \n \n \n \n                                                \n18 The guidelines state, in paras. 3.6 to 3.8, that for direct contracting, (i) no better offer is likely to be received, and \nthat the price to be paid is not more than the original price; and (ii) standardization of equipment or spare parts, to \nbe  compatible  with  existing  equipment,  may  justify  additional  purchases  from  the  original  supplier.  Under  the \nguidelines,  the  use  of  force  account  can  be  justified  when  (i)  quantities  of  work  involved  cannot  be  defined  in \nadvance, (ii) works are small and scattered or in remote locations and qualified construction firms are unlikely to bid \non them at reasonable prices, (iii) work is required to be carried out without disrupting ongoing operations, and (iv) \nthe  risks  of  unavoidable  work  interruption  are  better  borne  by  the  recipient  or  implementing  agency  than  by  a \ncontractor. \n\n19 It  will  actively  promote  the  involvement  of  women  in  employment  such  as  hiring  at  least  30%  women  in  local \n\nconstruction contracts and 50% female participation in training rolled out during project implementation.  \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n9 \n\nE. \n\nSafeguards \n\n27. \nEnvironment. The  two areas to  be  affected by activities  under  the  additional financing \nare  classified  as  category  B  for  the  environment.  Initial  environmental  examinations  were \nprepared  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009).  No  significant \nenvironmental impacts will result from the implementation of the overall project. \n \n28. \nInvoluntary resettlement and indigenous peoples. The proposed additional financing \nis category C for involuntary resettlement and indigenous peoples per ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy \nStatement (2009). The increased rehabilitation of the grid in \u2018Eua and Vava\u2019u will be carried out \nthrough the  replacement  of  existing  power  distribution  assets  located  on  public  land.  The  due \ndiligence,  including  stakeholder  consultations,  confirmed  that  it  will  not  require  any  additional \nland,  displace  people,  and  impact  on  any  assets  and  livelihood.  No  distinct  and  vulnerable \nindigenous peoples will be affected. All the activities in the overall project will be implemented in \na culturally appropriate and participatory manner. \n \nF. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n29. \nNo significant issues are expected to arise in implementing the overall project. Key risks \nand  mitigating  measures  are  described  in  detail  in  the  risk  assessment  and  risk  management \nplan.20 \n \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES  \n\nThe  government,  the  MFNP,  and  TPL  have  assured  ADB  that  implementation  of  the \n30. \nproject  shall  conform  to  all  applicable  ADB  policies  including  those  concerning  anticorruption \nmeasures,  safeguards,  gender,  procurement,  consulting  services,  and  disbursement  as \ndescribed in detail in the project administration manual and the  loan and grant documents. \n \n31. \nthe project, which are set forth in the financing agreement and project agreement. \n \n\nThe  government,  the  MFNP,  and  TPL  have  agreed  with  ADB  on  certain  covenants  for \n\nV. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\nI am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \n\n \n32. \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nthe  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to  SDR1,809,000  to  the \nKingdom  of  Tonga  for  the  additional  financing  of  the  Outer  Island \nRenewable Energy Project, from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources, with an \ninterest charge at the rate of 1.0% per annum during the grace period and \n1.5%  per  annum  thereafter;
