The design \nand monitoring framework for the project is in Appendix 1. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \n2. \nThe  project  is  critical  for  energy  security  in  Tajikistan.  It  targets  the  expansion  and \nmodernization  of  the  electricity  transmission  network  and  paves  the  way  for  much  needed \nreforms.  Transmission  network  modernization  is  a  precondition  to  cutting  system  losses, \nimproving  energy  efficiency,  and  facilitating  energy  trade  with  neighboring  countries.  The \nlatter  is  a  national  priority,  but  also  a  key  goal  under  the  Central  Asia  Regional  Economic \nCooperation  Program  (CAREC).  Reform  focuses  mainly  on  the  national  utility  company, \nBarki  Tojik.   This is  a  precondition  for  raising  key  performance  indicators,  governance,  and \ninstitutional  effectiveness.  A  problem  tree  analysis  provides  context  for  the  project.  This \nmirrors  the  design  and  monitoring  framework  (Appendix  1).  Key  sector  issues  are  given  in \nthe summary sector assessment.1 \n \n3. \nGeneration  gap.  About  98%  of  all  electricity  generated  in  the  country  comes  from \nhydropower plants (HPPs). While this is environmentally attractive and cost-effective, the mix \nalso results in significant winter shortages. It does produce high summer surpluses, but these \nare  wasted  unless  they  are  traded  with  neighboring  countries.  Current  installed  capacity  is \nabout  5,055  megawatts  (MW).  This  comes  from  eight  large  plants,  several  smaller \nhydropower facilities (4,737 MW), and two fossil-fuel-fired combined heat and power plants \n(318 MW). This capacity is more than enough to meet domestic demand during most months \nof  the  year,  but  not  in  the  winter.  Many  remote  areas  have  power  only  a  few  hours  a  day. \nThis affects rural and urban populations and businesses. \n \nEnergy security. The winter shortage (about 500 MW) has both short- and medium-\n4. \nterm  solutions.  The  latter  includes  non-hydro  facilities  and/or  building  selected  run-of-the \nriver  schemes.  While  not  rejecting  any  of  these  options,  the  government  is  more  keen  to \ndevelop larger, and by definition, longer-term projects, in particular, the completion of a large \ndam  first  started  under  the  Soviet  period  (Rogun). 2 The  latter  is  a  major  undertaking.  It \nrequires considerable technical and financial resources, strong project management and first \nclass  environmental  due  diligence  to  ensure  full  consensus  with,  and  among,  riparian \ncountries  over  the  water  flows  and  other  potential  impacts.  In  the  meantime,  the  most \neffective way to deliver energy security is to step up work on energy efficiency and to expand \nand modernize the transmission network. Regional trade is the most effective way to address \nwinter  shortages  and  summer  surpluses.  This  worked  well  in  the  past  and  can  be  easily \nrevived  in  the  future.  This  is  a  key  feature  of  the  CAREC  energy  strategy.  Trade  requires \nstrong  collaboration  among  the  regional  countries,  but  also  a  quality  transmission  network. \nRepairing this network is a top priority for the government, along with sector reforms and the \nrestructuring  of  Barki  Tojik.  Energy  efficiency  is  linked  to  transmission,  although  the \n\n                                                 \n1   Summary Sector Assessment: Energy (Appendix 2). \n2   Work on the first phase of the project is under way, although a share purchase scheme to finance these works \n\nhas been frozen. \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\ndistribution  system  and  the  energy  practices  by  industrial,  residential,  public  administration \nand commercial users also play a role. The distribution system needs improvements, but not \nas urgently as the transmission network.   \n \n5. \nTransmission. The transmission network is in a bad state of repair (leading to high \ntechnical  losses).  It  also  has  limited  geographic  coverage.  This  affects  the  evacuation  of \npower from plants and restricts winter and summer trade with Uzbekistan, Afghanistan and \nthe  Kyrgyz  Republic.    Low  network  coverage  exacerbates  Tajikistan\u2019s  high  dependence  on \nthe  Central  Asian  Power  System  which  operates  out  of  Tashkent.  At  the  same  time, \nimprovements  in  reliability  of  Tajikistan\u2019s  network  ultimately  improve  the  overall  reliability  of \nthe Central Asian Power System. The latter breaks down from time to time and often create \ndisputes among member countries. \n \n6. \nOperational  performance. Since 2006 the government increased electricity tariff by \nmore  than  200%;  however,  the  financial  position  of  the  sector  is  still  weak.  Technical  and \ncommercial losses are high, while the collection rate remains low. Arrears of the state-owned \nenterprises  are  increasing  with  organizations  under  the  Ministry  of  Land  Reclamation  and \nWater  Resources  being  on  the  top  of  the  list.  Recognizing  the  need  for  series  of  policy \nreforms  to  address  the  deteriorating  infrastructure,  inadequate  capacity,  and  weakened \ninstitutions,  the  government  developed  a  strategy  for  power  sector  reform  and  investment \nand requests international assistance. 3 \n \n7. \nProject. Although the energy sector needs investments across the entire chain, the \ngovernment  and  ADB  have  agreed  to  tackle  the  transmission  network  first.  This  requires \nphysical  investments  and  reforms.  The  project  is  included  in  the  Tajikistan  country \npartnership  strategy  (CPS)  2010-2014  and  country  operations  business  plan  2010-2012. \nThe project is part of CAREC. This is the second regional transmission project in Tajikistan. \nWork on a transmission line to Afghanistan is underway.4    \n \nB. \n \nThe  project  will  improve  the  reliability  of  the  transmission  system  and  supply  to \n8. \nhouseholds and businesses. This will increase energy security, energy efficiency, and energy \ntrade.  It  will  also  improve  reform,  governance,  and  the  operational  effectiveness  of  Barki \nTojik. The outcome will be an expanded and modernized high-voltage transmission network.  \n \nC. \n \n9. \n\nThe main components of the project are as follows: \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nOutputs \n\n \n\n(i)  \n\nConstruct  a  220-kilovolt  (kV)  transmission  line  between  Kairakum  and  Asht \n(approximately 70 km), and rehabilitate the Kairakum 220 kV substation and \none  additional  bay  in  the  Asht  220  kV  substation.  These  facilities  will  aid \nexports  to  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  and  increase  energy  security  in  the  northern \npart of the country, including Asht.   \n\n                                                 \n3   Summary Sector Assessment: Energy (Appendix 2). \n4   ADB.  2006.

The transmission line \nwill support electricity exports to Afghanistan5 and improve energy security in \nsouthern Tajikistan.  \n\nRehabilitate the Regar 500 kV and Baipaza 220 kV substations. Regar is the \nmajor  500  kV  substation  connecting  Tajikistan  to  the  Central  Asian  Power \nSystem.  Technical  problems  at  the  Regar  substation  impact  on  the  entire \nCentral Asian Power System, and interrupt electricity supplies to about 50% of \nTajikistan's consumers.  \n\nInstall  a  supervisory  control  and  data  acquisition  (SCADA)  system  at  the \nnational control center and key high-voltage substations.  This will replace an \noutdated and partially-collapsed Soviet telecommunication system and central \ncontrol panel with a real-time information system, essential for any substantial \nelectricity grid, and critical for decision making.  \n\nImplement  reforms  and  provide  capacity  development  and  operational \nperformance improvements at Barki Tojik and the power sector. ADB intends \nto  support  the  government  on  a  reform  action  plan  focusing  on  governance, \noperational  and  financial  performance,  including  cost  recovery.  It  will  take  a \nphased  approach  where  phase  1  focuses  on  comprehensive  assessment  of \nthe sector and Barki Tojik to define problems, deficiencies and opportunities. \nPhase 2 will define sector reforms and action plans including the restructuring \nof Barki Tajik, and phase 3 will focus on the implementation of the reforms.  It \nalso  includes  the  preparation  of  a  sector  development  master  plan  for \nrehabilitation  and  expansion  of  generation,  transmission  and  distribution  for \nthe  next  20  years.  Additionally,  it  provides  capacity  building  (planning  and \noversight), project management support, and training.6  \n\n \n\n1. \n\nPhysical \n\n \nThe project will build two new 220 kV single-circuit transmission lines totaling 140 km \n10. \nof overhead line (OHL). It will also rehabilitate in whole or part six transmission substations at \nKairakkum,  Asht,  Geran,  Rumi,  Baipaza,  and  Regar.  A  third  output  is  to  put  in  place  a \nSCADA  system  linked  to  a  National  Dispatch  Centre  in  Dushanbe,  and  32  priority \nsubstations  across  the  country  (capable  of  expansion  to  204  national  substations).  The \nconstruction of these facilities will be done through three design, supply and install contracts, \nincluding testing and commissioning. \n \n \n \n11. \nThe  project  will  implement  a  sector  operational  performance  improvement  program \ntargeting  Barki  Tojik  and  comprising  the  following  activities:  (i)  development  of  program \nstrategic and business plans and corporate governance changes; (ii) commercial, operating \nand financial plans; (iii) project management and training; (iv) preparation of accounting and \nmanagement \ntechnical  or  operational \nperformance audits.

The  amount  of  $9.5  million  will  be \nallocated to the Ministry of Energy and Industry for sector reforms and capacity development \nfor  Barki  Tojik.  The  remainder  will  be  re-lent  to  Barki  Tojik  through  a  subsidiary  loan \nagreement to fund the physical investments. The relending is for a term of 25 years, with a 5-\nyear  grace  period,  and  interest  rate  of  5%  per  annum.  Barki  Tojik  will  be  responsible  for \nforeign  exchange  risks,  an  established  practice  between  the  Ministry  of  Finance  and  Barki \nTojik.  The  government  and  Barki  Tojik  will  contribute  $19  million.  For  the  government\u2019s \ncontribution,  it  will  either  (i)  allocate  additional  funds  from  the  budget  to  cover  value-added \ntax  (VAT)  and  customs  duties  accrued  on  project  expenditures,  or  (ii)  exempt  the  project \n\n29 \n38 \n21 \n22 \n110 \n \n \n5 \n10 \n15 \n \n14 \n \n2 \n \n141 \n\n4 \n\nA.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nB.  \n \n \n \n \nC.  \n \nD.  \n\n \n\n\f \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nfrom  such  taxes  and  duties.

Project  implementation  management  will  be  outsourced  to  a \nspecialized  firm.  The  firm  will  report  to  Barki  Tojik  and  handle  all  project-related  activities, \nsuch as the preparation of tender documentation and oversight over the evaluation and the \ncontract awarding process. It will also supervise the contractors and report to the government \nand ADB on project execution performance. One of the requirements for the firm is to build \nthe facilities on time, within budget and to pre-set standards. Contracts will have fixed price \nand  fixed  delivery  periods,  with  premiums  and  penalties  against  performance  and  quality \nindicators.  The  implementation  arrangements  are  summarized  in  Table  3,  and  described  in \ndetail in the project administration manual.7 \n \n\nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \n \n\nAspects \nImplementation period \n \nEstimated project completion date \n \nProject management \n(i)   Executing agency (physical) \n(ii)  Executing agency (nonphysical) \n(iii)  Project management \n\nArrangements \n\nSeptember 2010\u2500July 2014 \n \nFebruary 2015 \n \n \nBarki Tojik  \nMinistry of Energy and Industry \nOutsourced to a consultant team \n\nProcurement \n\nMethod \n\nContracts \n\n(i)   Plant-design, supply and install contract \n\nfor substations \n\n(ii)  Plant-design, supply and install contract \n\nfor transmission lines \n\n(i)   Plant-design, supply and install contract \n\nfor SCADA \n\nConsulting services \n\n(i)   Project management (firm)  \n(ii)   Sector operational performance \nimprovement program (firms) \n\nDisbursement \n(i)  Plant-design, supply and install contract \n(ii) Consulting services \n\nICB \n\nICB \n\nICB \n\nQCBS \nQCBS \n\n1 \n\n1 \n\n1 \n\n1 \n1 \n\nMethod \n\nContracts \n\nAmount  \n($ million) \n40.0 \n\n35.0 \n\n18.5 \n\nAmount  \n($ million) \n5.0 \n9.5 \n\nType \nDirect payment \nDirect Payment/ \ncommitment/ \nreimbursement \n\nMinimum \n$100,000 \n$100,000 \n\nCeiling \nNo \nNo \n\n                                                 \n7  Project Administration Manual (Appendix 2). \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \nA. \n\n \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nTechnical \n \n15. \nADB  conducted  technical  due  diligence  on  the  investment  proposal  and  is  satisfied \nwith  the  quality  of  the  cost  estimates,  operating  cost  structures,  appropriateness  of  the \ntechnology, and the execution plan. The \u201creadiness\u201d level is high and the technical solutions \nare  assessed  to  be  more  cost-effective  than  the  alternatives.  The  SCADA  system  is  a \nstandard  power  utility  practice  based  on  proven  technology,  and  considered  appropriate  in \nthis  case.  Barki  Tojik\u2019s  operational  and  maintenance  staff  are  familiar  with  the  proposed \ndesign  concepts.  The  technical  proposals  do  not  represent  a  major  shift  from  existing \npractices. Training will be included in the contractor's scope of work.  The SCADA system is \na technological step change for the company. This will require training to be included in the \nterms  of  reference  of  project  management  consultants  and  contractors.  This  is  routine \npractice  for  a  utility  when  first  implementing  a  SCADA  system.  All  investment  sites  were \nvisited  by  consultants  and  ADB  staff,  and  the  poor  condition  of  existing  facilities  was \nconfirmed.  The  contracts  will  include  sufficient  spare  parts  and  quality  and  performance \nguarantees.  \n \nB. \n\nBarki Tojik Operations \n\n16. \nThe due diligence work included a full review of Barki Tojik operations.  Back in 2006 \nthe company was split from the Ministry of Energy and Industry, the intention being to deliver \nmore  efficiency  and  governance.  After  4  years,  performance  on  these  targets  has  been \ndisappointing. There are also gaps in the policy regime (shortcomings on planning, oversight, \ntariff  structures,  maintenance  and  conditions  for  private  sector  involvement).  The  company \nitself still lacks a clear strategic focus and sound management. Its business plan is disjointed \nand  unfunded.  Physical  assets  (generation,  transmission  and  distribution  facilities)  are  in  a \nbad  state  of  repair.  Maintenance  at  best  is  ad  hoc.  The  internal  organizational  structure  is \nineffective  and  corporate  governance  inept.  Management,  financial  and  operational  staff \nskills are inadequate. Decision-making is slow; even slower is the collection of receivables. \nTogether with ineffective cash management practices, these gaps aggravate an already dire \nfinancial  situation.  A  credible  financial  audit  needs  to  be  conducted  across  the  board. \nTechnical losses are high and increasing. Financial management is poor. The management \ninformation  and  reporting  systems  are  unreliable.  Service  quality  is  low,  and  so  is  staff \nrequired.  The \nmorale.  A \ncommercialization  of  operations  is  a  must  to  ensure  the  viability  of  any  investment.  The \nproposed  investment  in  transmission  facilities  will  be  synchronized  with  reforms  that  are \nincluded in the project. Others will form part of a program loan planned with ADB.  \n \n17. \nIn  particular,  the  government  is  willing  to  adopt  legal  and  regulatory  reforms  and \naccepts  the  concept  of  immediate  but  well-thought  out  restructuring.  It  is  also  keen  in \nopening  up  opportunities  for  the  private  sector,  particularly  in  power  generation.  The \nrestructuring  of  Barki  Tojik  needs  additional  and  detailed  due  diligence  and,  thereafter, \nspecific  and  sequenced  actions  in  three  areas:  (i)  commercialization  of  operations,  (ii) \ncompetition,  and  (iii)  divestment.  The  commercialization  aspect  is  critical  to  unlock  other \nchanges and ensure financial viability. The opening up of the market to independent power \ngeneration  companies  requires  access  to  an  efficient  transmission  network.  A  regulatory \nbody  will  ensure  equal  treatment  to  all.  The  sale  of  selected  generation  and  distribution \nassets  is  only  possible  once  a  policy,  legal,  and  regulatory  regime  is  in  place.  An \n\nrestructuring  and  management \n\nimprovement  plan \n\nis \n\n\fEconomic and Financial \n\nintergovernmental  committee  made  up  of  various  state  stakeholders  will  oversee  the \ndefinition and implementation of the reform and restructuring plans. It has asked ADB to be a \nmember of this committee (observer status), and oversee the reform works. The plan needs \nassessments where financial audit is a first priority. The other work will identify other gaps.  \n \nC. \n \nThe  financial  analysis  has  been  performed.  All  financial  costs  and  benefits  of  the \n18. \nproject are expressed in constant 2009 prices. Cost streams used to determine the financial \ninternal  rate  of  return,  i.e.,  capital  investment,  operation  and  maintenance,  insurance  costs \nand taxes, reflect the costs of delivering the benefits. The financial internal rate of return is \n6.24%.  This  is  higher  than  the  estimated  weighted  average  cost  of  capital  of  3.54%.  The \nfinancial  viability  was  estimated  by  comparing  the  incremental  costs  and  benefits  with-  and \nwithout-project  scenarios.  The  incremental  benefits  arise  from  reduced  outages  and \ndomestic  and  international  power  sales.  Regional  benefits  are  not  included  in  the  financial \nevaluation, although these are substantial.  \n \n19. \nThe  economic  viability  takes  into  account  a  stream  of  benefits  and  costs  resulting \nfrom  the  construction,  installation,  and  operation  of  the  facilities.  Although  the  regional \neconomic benefits are presented and highlighted, they are not included in the computation of \nthe economic internal rate of return as these accrue to countries other than Tajikistan. Other \nnon-quantifiable  benefits  are  in  local  areas  such  as  Asht,  Gafurov,  and  Kanibadam,  and \ninclude increased yields in agriculture (power supplies making a difference), increased hours \nof operation by processing industries (leading to more jobs and income), and the opening of \nschools  and  health  centers.  The  transmission  facilities  will  benefit  people  and  businesses. \nThe  economic  internal  rate  of  return  is  31.4%,  higher  than  the  12%  opportunity  cost  of \ncapital.8 \n \nD. \n \n20. \nThe government will comply with ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to \ndate) for the purposes of the project. ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through \nits  agents,  any  allegedly  corrupt,  fraudulent,  collusive,  or  coercive  practices  relating  to  the \nproject  and  the  government  will  cooperate  fully  with  any  such  investigation  and  extend  all \nnecessary  assistance.  To  support  these  efforts,  all  contracts  financed  by  ADB  will  include \nprovisions  specifying  the  right  of  ADB  to  audit  and  examine  the  records  and  accounts  of \nBarki  Tojik  and  all  contractors,  suppliers,  consultants,  and  other  service  providers  as  they \nrelate  to  the  project.  Grant  funds  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan \nDisbursement Handbook (2007, as amended from time to time).   \n \n21. \nA  financial  management  assessment  was  prepared  in  accordance  with  ADB \nguidelines.  The  work  includes  a  risk  management  assessment.  The  financial  management \ncapabilities  of  Barki  Tojik\u2019s  mirror  those  of  the  country.  There  are  substantial  gaps  in \naccounting standards, disclosure and auditing. Barki Tojik itself is in poor financial condition, \na situation aggravated by unacceptably low receivables collection rate. It has high electricity \nlosses  from  both  technical  and  commercial  sources,  inadequate  controls  and  reporting \nsystems, weak financial management arrangements, and a serious shortage of trained staff \nto  run  this  part  of  business.  Corporate  planning  is  inadequate.  Poor  customer  care  and \n                                                 \n8   Financial and Economic Analyses (Appendix 2). \n\nGovernance \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nPoverty and Social  \n\ncustomer relations are another feature of the business model. Barki Tojik is poorly managed \nand seriously underfunded. The governance structure is weak. \n \nE. \n \n22. \nThe  transmission  lines  will  cross  public  and  mostly  unused  lands  and  affect  cultivated \nplots  only  in  a  few  locations.  The  substations  will  have  no  social  impacts  at  all.  Employment \nopportunities are expected during the construction. Gender-responsive core labor standards \nto  promote  female  employment  opportunities  with  non-discrimination,  equal  pay  for  work  of \nequal  value,  and  provision  of  separate  male  and  female  toilets  where  appropriate  will  be \nensured. The construction site will have an influx of workers which can increase the risk of \nHIV/AIDS.  A  gender-sensitive  HIV/AIDS  awareness  campaign  will  be  conducted  for \nconstruction  workers  and  communities  adjacent  to  the  construction  site.  This  will  be \nmonitored by ADB and the project supervision advisors.  \n\n \nSafeguards \n\nF. \n \n\n1. \n\nEnvironmental Assessment  \n\n2. \n\nSocial Assessment \n\n \nAn  environmental  assessment  was  completed.9 Environmental  categorization  of  the \n23. \nproject  is  B.  The  transmission  lines  run  through  areas  with  low  environmental  sensitivities \nand do not traverse any village or settlement. Distances to any dwelling or settlement will be \nkept at a minimum of 50 meters. No significant or irreversible impacts are expected with the \noperation  of  the  new  lines.  There  will  be  some  temporary  impacts  during  the  construction \nphase  but  appropriate  mitigation  measures  have  been  developed.  Provided \nthe \nenvironmental management and monitoring program is properly implemented, these impacts \nwill  not  be  significant.  Barki  Tojik\u2019s  environmental  management  expertise  is  low;  provisions \nfor training are included in the environmental management budget. \n \n \n \nTwo subprojects\u2500Geran-Rumi and the Kairakhum-Asht transmission lines\u2500will cause \n24. \nimpacts only on two-thirds and one-third of the alignment, respectively, and affect only small \nplots occupied by tower bases. These two subprojects will also cause small losses of crops \nand  trees  due  to  stringing  operations  and  the  construction  of  the  towers.  Overall,  the \nsubproject impacts will have minimal effects on the livelihood of affected people. No impact \non buildings will occur and no family will have to be resettled. In order to assess and set the \nmechanisms for the compensation of these impacts, a land acquisition and resettlement plan \nwas prepared in accordance with the ADB Safeguard Policy Statement (2009).10 Involuntary \nresettlement  category  is  B.  Under  Tajikistan  law,  few  farmers  own  their  lands.  This  means \nthat  no  land  will  be  technically  acquired  and  no  land  compensation  will  be  provided. \nHowever,  to  rehabilitate  the  affected  people  for  land-use  losses,  they  will  receive  income \nfrom  the  land  occupied  by  the  towers  in  addition  to  actual  crop  compensation.  The  two \ntransmission  lines  will  affect  Tajik  and  Uzbek  communities.  These  are  considered  to  be \nparticularly  vulnerable,  and  are  generally  well  adapted  to  the  Tajikistan  political-economic \nprocess. These groups do not show elements that would identify them as indigenous peoples \n\n                                                 \n9   Initial Environmental Examination (Appendix 2). \n10  Land Acquisition and Resettlement Plans for the Gerein-Rumi 220 kV Transmission Line, and Kairakhum-Asht \n\n220 kV Transmission Line (Appendix 2). \n\n\fas defined by the relevant ADB policy. Such a policy, therefore, will not be triggered by this \nproject and indigenous people categorization of the project is C.  \n\n \nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\nG. \n \n25. \nThe  project  does  not  have  any  unusual  technical  risks.  The  components  will  use \nstandard technologies, and these conform to international standards. They are commercially \nproven  and  widely  used  across  the  world.  During  the  implementation,  various  tasks  will  be \noutsourced  to  independent  experts.  This  will  ensure  that  the  equipment  and  works  comply \nwith design requirements and agreed quality standards. The risk of improper operation and \nmaintenance  of  facilities  will  be  mitigated  through  training  programs  at  the  level  of  Barki \nTojik.  The  broader  policy  framework  will  also  be  tightened  to  pay  more  attention  to \nmaintenance.  \n \n26. \nAnother risk is the weak organizational structure of Barki Tojik. This will be changed. \nProject  management  and  implementation  work  will  be  outsourced  to  an  international \nconsulting firm.    \n \n27.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4.
