The brief background leading to the need for this major changes and the change \nproposed  in  line  with  the  Government  of  India\u2019s  request  is  summarized  below  and  covered  in \ndetail in subsequent sections.  \n \n2. \n\n(iii) \n\nThe revised design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. The major changes are: \n(i) \n(ii) \n\nthe loan of $150 million to India for the program to be reduced to $105 million;3 \nthe  number  of  tranches  for  the  program  is  reduced  from  four  to  three  and  the \nbalance  of  $85  million  to  be  released  in  two  tranches  of  $40  million  for  the \nsecond tranche and $45 million for the third tranche; \nthe  total  number  of  policy  conditions  for  the  release  of  tranches  to  be  reduced \nfrom  90  to  66  inclusive  of  the  first  tranche  (first  tranche:  16  conditions;  second \ntranche:  32  conditions  from  earlier  31;  third  tranche:  18  conditions  from  earlier \n26; and fourth tranche: nil from 17 earlier); \nthe  policy  conditions  relating  to  the  setting  up  of  a  marketing  organization  with \nmajority private sector ownership and private sector participation in central sliver \nplants (CSPs) of the Khadi and Village Industries Commission (KVIC) have been \ndropped  from  the  program  as  they  are  not  feasible  due  to  inadequate  interest \nfrom the private sector; \nto  carry  out  the  restructured  program,  the  closing  date  to  be  extended  to  31 \nDecember 2017; and \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n \n3. \nThe  attached  technical  assistance  (TA)  for  Capacity  Building  for  Reforming  the  Khadi \nand  Village  Industry  Subsector  in  India  will  be  extended  until  31  December  2017  and  aligned \nwith the restructured program implementation requirements (para. 21).4 \n \n\nII. \n\nBACKGROUND \n\n \nThe government, as part of its 11th Five-Year Plan (FY2007\u20132012), sought to increase \n4. \nemployment  in  the  rural  nonfarm  sector  (RNS).  The  government  identified  khadi  and  village \nindustries  (KVI)  as  one  with  significant  prospects  for  employment.  Upon  request  from  the \ngovernment,  the  Board  of  Directors  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  approved  on  2 \nOctober  2008  the  program  to  support  the  government's  efforts  for  enhancing  income  and \nemployment growth in the KVI subsector through a $150 million loan. \n \n\n                                                 \n1  Khadi and village industries (KVI), originally promoted by Mahatma Gandhi in the 1920s for rural self-employment, \nform a significant subsector of the rural nonfarm sector (RNS). Khadi is handspun and handwoven cloth. The raw \nmaterials  (cotton,  silk,  or  wool)  are  spun  and  woven  on  hand-spinning  wheels  called  charkha  and  woven  on \nhandlooms. \n\n2  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB).  2008.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors: \nProposed Program Loan and Technical Assistance Grant to India for the Khadi Reform and Development Program. \nManila (Loan 2452-IND, approved on 2 October 2008, made effective on 2 February 2010). \n\n3  The costing for the program elements estimated based on major changes in scope and prevailing cost. In case the \nBoard  approves  the  proposed  major  change,  a  consequent  reduction  in  the  loan  size  (i.e.,  $45  million)  would  be \nprocessed in accordance with ADB. 1982. Ordinary Operations Loan Regulations. Section 9.02. Manila. \n\n4   If the Board approves the major change in the Program and release of the revised second tranche, then extension \nand  alignment  of  the  TA  would  be  processed  for  approval  in  accordance  with  the  Project  Administration \nInstructions. The third tranche is expected to be completed in December 2017. \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nThe Government of India and ADB signed the loan on 22 December 2009 and it became \n5. \neffective on 2 February 2010. The loan was to be released in four tranches within 3 years as per \nthe following schedule: tranche 1 (16 conditions) for $20 million; tranche 2 (31 conditions) from \n8 months of tranche 1 for $40 million; tranche 3 (26 conditions) from 13 months of tranche 2 for \n$40 million; and tranche 4 (17 conditions) from 15 months of tranche 3 for $50 million. \n \n6. \nThe loan of $150 million financed from the ADB ordinary capital resources was provided \nunder the London interbank offered rate-based (LIBOR) lending facility to the government. The \nloan  has  a  15-year  term,  including  a  grace  period  of  3  years,  and  an  interest  rate  to  be \ndetermined  in  accordance  with  LIBOR,  a  commitment  charge  of  0.15%  per  annum,  and  such \nother terms and conditions set forth in the signed loan agreement. \n \nThe Ministry of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MMSME) is the executing agency, \n7. \nand  KVIC  is  the  implementing  agency  for  the  program.  A  dedicated  Reform  Implementation \nDivision (RID) was set up at the KVIC in October 2009 and reform management units (RMUs) \nwere established at the state and division level to implement the program in July 2010 as per \nthe  program  requirement.  The  RID  is  responsible  for  overall  monitoring  and  for  coordinating \nactions under the program. RMUs are program implementing units responsible at the state and \ndivision level. In 2008, the Reform Implementation and Monitoring Committee at MMSME was \nformed to serve as the program steering committee. \n \n8. \nImpact  and  outcome.  The  enhancement  of  income  and  employment  growth  for  the \nRNS is the impact envisaged from the program. The outcome is to revitalize the KVI subsector \nwith  an  enhanced  sustainability  of  khadi,  increased  employment  generation  and  incomes, \nincreased artisan welfare, and developed select traditional village industries.  \n \n9. \nPolicy framework and actions. The program comprises (i) establishing a policy reform \nand  implementation  framework,  (ii)  promoting  and  marketing  khadi,  (iii)  realizing  procurement \nand production efficiencies, and (iv) implementing institutional reforms. The recommendations of \na  high-level  working  group  of  the  government,  ADB  assessment  of  policy  and  institutional \naspects  of  khadi,  and  an  intensive  consultation  with  stakeholders  all  contributed  to  the \nestablishment and design of the program.   \n \n10. \nPerformance indicators. The key performance targets and indicators developed for the \nprogram include a 15% increase in artisans employed by khadi institutions, 20% increase in the \nprevailing earnings, 10% increase in sales on an annual compounded basis, 15% reduction in \nraw material (sliver) production cost, and 10 new ventures to be initiated in the khadi subsector \nunder  a  producer  company  and/or  entrepreneurial  model.5 It  also  required  KVIC  to  disengage \nfrom direct commercial activities, specifically from marketing and sliver production; implement a \ncomprehensive reform plan for 300 eligible khadi institutions; strengthen information technology \n(IT)  and  e-governance  systems  and  practices  of  KVIC;  and  implement  a  cluster  development \nstrategy in five traditional village industries. \n \n11. \nA  TA  grant  from  the  Japan  Special  Fund,  funded  by  the  Government  of  Japan,  in  the \namount  of  $2  million  was  attached  to  the  program.  The  goal  of  the  TA  is  to  support  the \nimplementation of the khadi reform package and its objective is to expedite the commencement \nof the reforms. The TA consisted of supporting the executing agency and implementing agency \n\n                                                 \n5  In the producer company model, the institution is owned and run by the primary producers as opposed to the trust\u2013\nsociety model, where the office bearers are from outside the artisan and/or weaver fraternity. In the entrepreneurial \nmodel, individuals can start the enterprise as an entrepreneurship venture with the motivation to gain profit.  \n\n\fto  adopting \n\nthe  comprehensive \n\nin  strengthening  program  management,  providing  support  in  promoting  and  marketing  khadi, \nfacilitating procurement and production functions, and supporting institutional reforms.  \n \n12. \nADB  released  the  first  tranche  of  $20  million  on  17  February  2010  upon  satisfactory \ncompliance  with  policy  conditions.  As  part  of  the  implementation  activities  under  the  second \ntranche,  the  executing  agency  and  the  implementing  agency  substantially  completed  most  of \nthe  policy  conditions  except  the  ones  related  to  private  sector  participation  in  the  marketing \norganization  and  CSPs,  which  could  not  be  completed  despite  multiple  attempts  to  identify \nprivate  sector  partners  through  a  bidding  process.  Further,  khadi  institutions'  initial  reluctance \nand \nreform  program  delayed  program \nresistance \nimplementation.6  \n \nDespite the delay, the program yielded significant positive impact and outcomes through \n13. \na  detailed  and  extensive  stakeholder  consultation  process.  Some  of \nthe  program's \nunprecedented changes include the formulation of the \u201cKhadi Mark.\u201d The mark created a distinct \nidentity  for  khadi,  which  has  been  in  existence  since  the  1920s,  and  notification  for  market \npricing,  which  enabled  khadi  institutions  to  sell  khadi  at  market  prices  and  move  away  from \n\u201ccost-chart\u201d principles that did not allow khadi institutions to earn profits.7 The program has also \nenabled  improvement  in  the  governance  framework  through  greater  representation  of  artisans \nand weavers, including at least one woman representative, in the board of khadi institutions. It \nhas  also  helped  in  improving  production  and  reducing  drudgery  through  modern  implements, \nand increased sales through renovated modern sales outlets and monitoring through real-time \nmanagement information systems (MIS).  \n \nThe  program  was  originally  scheduled  for  completion  on  30  September  2011  and \n14. \nextended  several  times  to  30  September  2015.  The  government  is  keen  to  continue  the \nprogram,  since  the  reform  measures  implemented  are  making  the  sector  sustainable  without \nbudgetary support and increasing the earnings for those employed in the sector. In this context, \nthe  government  requested  ADB,  through  a  letter  dated  17  December  2015,  to  waive  the \nrequirement  of  meeting  the  infeasible  policy  conditions  and  release  the  funds  for  the  second \ntranche.  In  response,  ADB  informed  the  government  that  such  extensive  waiver  of  policy \nconditions is generally not considered.  \n \n15. \nOn 14 January 2016, the government organized a high-level meeting with ADB where all \noptions to revive the program were discussed.8 The meeting concluded that there was a need to \nfield  ADB  consultation  missions  to  assess  and  explore  options  for  the  revival  of  the  program, \nincluding restructuring. To this end, the program is currently extended to 31 December 2016. \n \n\nIII. \n\nIMPLEMENTATION PROGRESS \n\n \nADB fielded a consultation mission on 24 February 2016.  The ADB mission found that \n16. \nout of 31 policy conditions for the release of the second tranche, 22 were fully complied with and \n9 were noncompliant as of 28 February 2016. The detailed review of policy action compliance9 \nand  the  detailed  performance  overview  of  the  program  components  are  attached. 10  The \nsummary of implementation progress is provided in paras. 17-20.  \n \n                                                 \n6  Comprehensive reform package adopted as part of the first tranche policy condition. \n7  In the 1920s, Mahatma Gandhi formulated the cost-chart principle for the costing of khadi products. \n8  Minutes of the meeting dated 8 February 2016 set out the approach for the revival of the loan. \n9  Status of Policy Conditions as of 28 February 2016 (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n10  Performance Overview (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\fPolicy  reform  and  implementation  framework.  The  government  formulated  a \n17. \ncomprehensive  reform  package  for  the  KVI  subsector  and  approved  the  implementation \nframework  for  KVIC  to  carry  out  the  reforms  as  part  of  the  first  tranche  policy  conditions. \nFurther, as part of the second tranche, the executing agency (MMSME) and the implementing \nagency (KVIC) established institutional arrangements such as the Reform Implementation and \nMonitoring Committee at the national level, RID at the KVIC head office , and RMUs at the state \noffices. The KVIC conducted a series of dissemination workshops in April 2010 at the national \nand state levels to communicate and build awareness for the reform measures being taken up \nas  part  of  the  program.  During  the  initial  implementation,  RID  and  RMUs  observed  a  certain \ndegree  of  reluctance  from  khadi  institutions.  Subsequently,  to  understand  and  address  the \nconcerns  of  khadi  institutions,  several  state  and  nationwide  workshops  were  held  during  the \nimplementation period (2011\u20132013). This helped in building consensus and greater acceptance \nof  the  policy  reform  and  implementation  framework.  Overall  assessment  of  this  component  is \nsatisfactory  and  the  specific  performance  targets  and  milestones  have  been  achieved  though \ndelayed. \n \n18. \n \n\nInstitutional reforms. The institutional reforms component has four broad elements. \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\nthe \n\ninstitutional \n\nOrganizational restructuring. KVIC reorganized the directorates and conducted \na  staffing  norm  study  in  2008  to  increase  its  operational  effectiveness.  This,  in \nturn,  helped  in  bringing  greater  focus  and  accountability  among  the  KVIC \ndirectorates.  It  also  helped  in  the  devolution  of  powers  to  state  and  division \noffices  for  smoother  and  faster  implementation  of  all  the  government  schemes \nimplemented  by  KVIC.  As \nrequired  capacity \nenhancement,  KVIC,  through  ADB-assisted  TA,  carried  out  an  assessment  of \nexisting  training  arrangements,  including  infrastructure,  capacity  of  trainers,  and \ncurriculum.  Based  on  this  assessment,  it  developed  a  comprehensive  capacity \nbuilding  plan  in  2011  and  put  in  place  the  annual  preparation  of  a  training \ncalendar.  To  date,  office  bearers  from  khadi  institutions  covering  over  783 \nparticipants have  received  training on  quality  testing,  store  operations and  MIS, \nand  gender  mainstreaming  and  environmental  safeguards.  It  also  has  covered \ntraining  for  about  3,000  artisans,  including  57  as  master  trainers  at  khadi \ninstitutions level, who in turn are training other artisans at their respective khadi \ninstitutions.  \n\nreforms \n\n(MIS)  and \n\nInformation  System \n\nManagement \ntechnology \ninterventions.  KVIC  has  initiated  the  development  and  implementation  of  an \nMIS for the khadi institutions to assist the khadi institutions in the management of \ntheir  inventory,  finance,  sales,  and  timely  reporting  to  KVIC.  The  MIS  is  under \npilot implementation in eight khadi institutions and a plan to rollout of MIS to 30 \nkhadi  institutions  was  prepared  on  28  February  2016.  KVIC  developed  an  e-\ngovernance and IT road map through an ADB-assisted TA, which will eventually \nintegrate all the IT systems used by the KVI subsector.  \n\ninformation \n\nDirect  reform  assistance.  KVIC  conducted  in  FY2012  a  management  audit  of \n73  khadi  institutions  to  ascertain  their  institutional  ability  to  absorb  the  direct \nreform  assistance  (DRA)  provided  under  the  program.  A  total  of  54  khadi \ninstitutions were found to be eligible for DRA, of which only 38 khadi institutions \nsigned a memorandum of understanding with KVIC for adopting the khadi reform \npackage.  On  28  February  2016,  KVIC  achieved  a  fund  disbursement  of  $1 \n\n4 \n\n \n\n\f \n(iv) \n\nmillion,  which  was  used  to  provide  3,806  new  model  charkhas 11  and  251 \nhandlooms,  build  38  central  facility  centers  and  work  sheds,  and  renovate  164 \nsales  outlets  of  khadi  institutions.  Since  the  program  impact  of  this  component \nseemed  to  be  significant,  ADB  requested  KVIC  to  carry  out  an  impact \nassessment.  \n\nTraditional  village  industries.  This  element  of  the  program  required  KVIC  to \nconduct a diagnostic survey of five identified traditional village industries12 under \nthe first tranche and formulate a cluster development strategy for them to achieve \nsynergy  with  the  initiatives  carried  out  for  the  khadi  subsector.  KVIC  appointed \nfive  technical  agencies  in  2011  to  conduct  the  diagnostic  study,  prepare  the \ndetailed  project  report,  and  provide  need-based  technical  support  for  the \nrespective clusters. The identified clusters were appraised and a comprehensive \nsustainability index was developed based on parameters related to the potential \nfor  employment  generation,  scope \nfor  business  expansion,  ease  of \nimplementation, and sustainability. Post-shortlisting of clusters and implementing \nagencies  were  identified  and  now  the  cluster  development  implementation  is \nunderway  in  the  bee-keeping  cluster.13 Overall  assessment  of  the  institutional \nreforms  component  is  satisfactory  and  the  specific  performance  targets  and \nmilestones set have been achieved with some delay in the DRA component. \n\nPromoting  and  marketing  of  khadi.  The  promotion  and  marketing  of  khadi  reforms \n\n \n19. \ncomponent has two elements.  \n \n\n(i) \n\nKhadi Mark. The program required KVIC to develop the Khadi Mark, including a \nlogo,  to  provide  a  distinct  identity  for  genuine  khadi,  and  the  registration  of  the \nKhadi Mark under the Trade Mark Act.14 During implementation, it was found that \nthere was a legal impediment in registering the mark under the Trade Mark Act \nuntil KVIC was engaged in commercial activities of production and marketing of \nkhadi.  To  achieve  the  intended  reform  objective,  MMSME  formulated  the  Khadi \nMark  Regulation  2013  by  drawing  powers  from  the  KVIC  Act  1956.  The \nregulation,  along  with  the  logo,  was  published  in  July  2013  in  the  central \ngovernment  gazette  and  posted  in  the  upper  house  of  the  Parliament.  The \nregulation provides KVIC the right to act against persons infringing on its specific \nprovisions,  which  includes  the  sale  of  spurious  khadi  and  the  sale  of  khadi \nwithout  a  Khadi  Mark  logo.  The  required  guidelines,  protocols,  committees  for \nmanaging issues related to the Khadi Mark, and testing infrastructure have also \nbeen announced by KVIC. A total of 1,468 working khadi institutions have been \nregistered for the Khadi Mark as of 28 February 2016. While there is a deviation \nfrom  the  original  policy  condition,  the  executing  agency  and  the  implementing \nagency  were  able  to  achieve  the  intended  reform  objective  through  the  Khadi \nMark  Regulation  2013.  It  is  also  being  recognized  as  one  of  the  far-reaching \nreform achievements of the program. \n\n \n\nprocessing. \n\nchain. \n\n                                                 \n11 A  charkha  is  a  domestic  spinning  wheel.  New  model  charkhas  have  eight  spindles  and  help  produce  more  yarn \n\nwith the same effort as the old charkhas. \n\n12 The  five  industries  identified  were  herbal  products,  honey,  handmade  paper,  leather,  and  agro-based  food \n\n13 Details regarding shortlisting can be found on the KVIC website in activities under KRDP. http://kvic.org.in. \n14 Section 70 of the Trade Mark Act required the certifying organization to be completely disengaged from the value \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n(ii) \n\n \n20. \nfour elements. \n \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n\nMarketing organization. The program required KVIC to identify private partners \nand  set  up  a  marketing  organization  with  a  majority  shareholding  by  a  private \npartner  and  to  disengage  from  the  marketing  function.  The  KVIC  and  MMSME \nconducted a bidding twice to identify private partners but received no response.15 \nKVIC  was  also  required  to  undertake  a  market  assessment  survey  to  aid  the \nmarketing  initiatives  with  support  from  the  marketing  organization.  As  the \nestablishment  of  the  marketing  organization  was  delayed  and  found  to  be \ninfeasible,  KVIC  commissioned  the  market  survey  with  support  from  an  ADB-\nassisted TA. The market survey was completed in 2011 and its outputs are being \nused  to  rationalize  the  product  categories  and  as  an  input  for  promoting  the \nKhadi Mark. Since it was not possible to set up a marketing organization through \nprivate  sector  participation,  the  executing  agency  and  the  implementing  agency \nare  taking  the  reform  interventions  originally  planned  to  be  carried  out  by  the \nmarketing organization through the marketing directorate with support from khadi \ninstitutions. Overall assessment for this component is not satisfactory. While the \nspecific  performance  targets  and  milestones  set  for  the  Khadi  Mark  have  been \nachieved  with  deviations,  the  targets  and  milestones  related  to  the  marketing \norganization  has  not  been  achieved.  A  detailed  analysis  of  this  component  is \nincluded in the performance overview.16    \n\nRevitalizing  procurement  and  production  efficiencies.  This  reform  component  has \n\nRaw  material  procurement  and  cotton  sliver  production.  The  program \nrequired KVIC to train khadi institutions on quality testing of raw material and to \nexecute  public\u2013private  partnership  (PPP)  agreements  in  two  CSPs.  KVIC \nconducted  training  for  300  master  trainers  from  300  khadi  institutions  in  April \n2011. KVIC initiated the process of identifying private partners through a bidding \nprocess  for two  CSPs  (Etah  and  Sehore)  in  2011  but  did  not  get  any  response \nfrom the market. In formal consultations, potential private sector players indicated \nthat sliver and roving,17 which are intermediary products of the textile value chain \nand produced by low-capacity plants, were of little interest to the private sector. \nBased on this feedback, the bidding framework was revised to include potential \npartners  from  the  khadi  subsector  and  two  CSPs  (Raebareilly  and  Chitradurga) \nwere  put  out  for  bidding  in  2013.  Only  one  response  from  an  existing  khadi \ninstitution was received for the Chitradurga CSP, which could not be considered \nbased on KVIC procurement rules. Therefore, this policy condition is infeasible to \nachieve.  The  detailed  analysis  on \nthe \nperformance overview (footnote 15).    \n\nthis  component \n\nis  described \n\nin \n\nMarket-linked  pricing. As mandated by the program, KVIC is required to allow \nkhadi  institutions  to  set  market-linked  prices  and  formulate  a  benefits  chart  for \nsharing  the  surplus  among  stakeholders.  KVIC  introduced  the  market-linked \npricing  in  July  2010  when  it  announced  a  market  development  assistance \nscheme under which the khadi institutions were allowed to move from the earlier \n\n                                                 \n15 The first bidding process was initiated in 2011 and the second bidding process in 2013. Details are provided in the \n\nPerformance Overview (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n16  Performance Overview (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).   \n17 Sliver and roving are intermediary products between cotton and yarn in the textile value chain and are only used by \nthe khadi subsector for hand spinning to convert into yarns. No interest exists from other textile manufacturers for \nthis product. \n\n\f \n(iii) \n\n \n(iv) \n\nimplementing  market-linked  pricing.  KVIC  publicized \n\nexisting  cost\u2500chart  principle  to  a  market-based  flexible  pricing.  This  scheme  is \naimed  at  generating  maximum  surplus  for  the  artisans  as  well  as  for  the \ninstitutions,  and \nthe \nguidelines  for  the  benefit  chart  in  2011,  which  aims  to  ensure  that  surpluses, \ngenerated  by  the  shift  to  market-linked  pricing,  and  expected  increases  in  the \nprice  realization  through  proposed  product  and  marketing  reforms  are  shared \nwith  artisans  and  weavers.  Market-linked  pricing  is  one  of  the  critical  changes \ntransforming  the  sector,  providing  an  opportunity  to  redistribute  profits  for  the \nbenefit  of  the  stakeholders.  The  overall  assessment  of  this  element  of  the \nprogram is satisfactory.   \n\nRationalization  of  financial  assistance.  This  element  required  KVIC  to \nformulate the production incentive plan, reassess the working capital requirement \nfor  khadi  production,  and  appoint  a  focal  person  to  engage  with  the  bankers  to \nenhance  the  access  of  khadi  institutions  to  the  formal  banking  sector.  KVIC \nalready  introduced  and  initiated  the  implementation  of  the  Production  Incentive \nPlan  in  2011.  Under  the  plan,  KVIC  will  help  khadi  institutions  categorize  their \nproducts and avail financial assistance on specific categories of khadi products, \nwhich  require  fiscal  support  to  increase  the  competitiveness.  KVIC  reassessed \nthe  working  capital  requirement  and  initiated  actions  to  reduce  the  blocked \nworking capital by reducing the debtor days of CSPs and ensure prompt payment \nfor the sale of finished goods. It has also appointed a focal person to help khadi \ninstitutions to access bank funds. The implementation of this element has helped \nbring efficiency in utilizing government funds and subsidies. The overall progress \nunder this element is satisfactory but has been slow in pace. \n\nNew  khadi ventures. This element required KVIC to develop the framework for \na producer company model and an enterprise model for new ventures in khadi. \nKVIC developed and issued the framework for forming khadi ventures through a \nproducer company model. This was meant to increase artisan empowerment, as \ngovernance  and  management  of  such  ventures  would  consist  of  primary \nproducers  (artisans,  spinners,  and  weavers).  At  awareness  workshops  to \npromote  these  models,  investors  indicated  their  concern  that  there  was \ninadequate  support  from  the  government  to  incentivize  these  models.  To \nimplement \nthe  executing  and \nimplementing  agencies  decided  to  mainstream  this  activity  through  the  Prime \nMinister\u2019s  Employment  Generation  Program  and  the  Scheme  of  Fund  for \nRegeneration  of  Traditional  Industries, 18  which  provide  incentives  to  such \nventures.  The  overall  assessment  of  this  element  of  program  is  satisfactory; \nhowever,  the  executing  agency  has  proposed  to  remove  this  from  the  ambit  of \nthe program and pursue it under other schemes. \n\nin  a  subsequent \n\nthese  models \n\ntranche, \n\n \n21. \nThe  ADB-assisted  TA  has  been  supporting  the  program  implementation  since \nSeptember 2010. The TA of $2 million is financed on a grant basis by the Japan Special Fund \nand was originally scheduled to close on 30 September 2011. However, it has been extended \nfive times up to 31 December 2016 in line with the extension of the underlying program. Out of \nthe  total  TA  amount  of  $2  million,  $1.84  million  (92%)  has  been  committed  and  $1.32  million \n(65%) has been disbursed. The delay in the implementation and extension of the program from \n\n                                                 \n18 ADB  is  considering  a  loan  for  the  Scheme  of  Fund  for  Regeneration  of  Traditional  Industries  to  cover  800 \n\ntraditional village industry clusters. The design activities will be included in the proposed loan.  \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nthe  earlier  envisaged  3  years  to  the  current  period  of  more  than  6  years  will  require  a \nrealignment of TA inputs and its extension to meet the current requirements of accelerating the \nimplementation  activities  and  focus  on  key  interventions  of  the  DRA,  and  MIS  and  IT \nimplementation. The TA will consist of the following components until its extended period by 31 \nDecember 2017: \n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nSupport program management.  The TA will continue to support MMSME and \nKVIC in the overall management, implementation, and monitoring of the program. \nPromote  the  Khadi  Mark.  The  implementation  of  the  Khadi  Mark  requires  TA \nsupport in monitoring and supporting the development of promotional activities. \nSupport  institutional  reforms.  The TA needs to continue to support KVIC and \nkhadi  institutions  through  the  assistance  provided  in  training  and  development \nactivities.  \ninformation \nImplement \ntechnology.  The  TA  will  support  the  implementation  of  MIS  in  300  khadi \ninstitutions and the program management of integrated IT system implementation \nwithin KVIC. \nSupport  the  direct  reform  assistance.  The  TA  will  support  the  accelerated \nimplementation of DRA to the remaining 320 khadi institutions by 31 December \n2017. \n\ninformation  system  and \n\nthe  management \n\n(vi)  Monitor the progress of the village industry clusters.  The TA will extend its \nsupport  to  monitoring  the  implementation  progress  in  the  five  village  industry \nclusters and managing the program of the implementation agency.  \n \n\n22. \nBased  on  this  assessment  by  the  ADB  consultation  mission,  the  Government  of  India \nformally requested ADB to restructure and revive the program. ADB fielded multiple consultation \nmissions  during  March\u2013May  2016  to  arrive  at  optimal  restructuring  and  feasible  policy  options \naligned  to  the  current  context.  The  revision  of  policy  conditions  involved  a  greater  focus  on \nDRA, increasing the beneficiary khadi institutions from 300 to 400 and removing the infeasible \nPPP  policy  conditions  discussed  in  para.  19(ii)  and  para.  20(i).  This  suggestion  required  the \nreview  of  the  program  structure  to  rationalize  its  three  tranches  and  the  reduction  of  policy \nconditions  from  90  to  66.  Based  on  these,  the  costs  associated  with  the  suggested  policy \nconditions  were  reworked  and  the  total  program  cost  is  now  estimated  at  $105  million. \nAccordingly,  the  loan  amount  is  proposed  to  be  changed  to  $105  million  and  structured  to  be \ndisbursed in three tranches with revised policy conditions as described in para. 2. With this, on \nMay 2016, the Government of India requested to initiate the restructuring process at the earliest.    \n \nADB's  South  Asia  Department  management  approved  the  program  review  mission19 to \n23. \ninitiate  discussions  with  the  government  on  the  proposed  restructuring  program  and  progress \nmade  in  achieving  the  revised  policy  conditions.  Based  on  this,  the  government  submitted  a \nrevised development policy letter on 22 July 2016. The revised policy conditions of the program \nand  the  current  compliance  status  as  of  30  September  2016  are  in  the  Revised  Policy  Matrix \nand Revised Policy Conditions based on the Revised Policy Matrix.20  \n \n \n \n\n                                                 \n19 The first review mission was conducted on 29 June\u20137 July 2016 and the second review mission on 17 August\u201324 \n\nAugust 2016. \n\n20 Revised Policy Matrix and Revised Policy Conditions based on the Revised Policy Matrix (accessible from the list \n\nof linked documents in Appendix 2). All 32 Tranche 2 conditions have been fully complied with. \n\n\fIV. \n\nRATIONALE FOR THE PROPOSED CHANGES \n\n \n24. \nThe  program  has  brought  far-reaching  changes  to  the  KVI  sector  and  impacted \npositively  on  the  lives of  more  than  1  million artisans  and  their  families  employed  in  the khadi \nsubsector.   Some  of  these  changes  include increased  earnings21 due  to  market-linked  pricing, \nfinancial inclusion due to mandatory direct benefit transfers through bank accounts,22 increased \nproduction and sales through the support of DRA, increased empowerment and representation \nin the decision-making of khadi institutions, and capacity building in new technology and trends. \nThe program also brought efficiency to the sector and is helping the government rationalize the \nfinancial support and bring sustainability to the sector, without budgetary support.  \n   \n25. \nHowever,  the  program's  earlier  design  relied  heavily  on  private  sector  participation  to \naddress the efficiency and productivity issues in the sector. The market was not ready for it; this \nwas reflected in the lukewarm response to the process initiated for identifying private partners \nfor the marketing organization and CSPs. The program design also dwelled into specific micro-\nlevel  actions  within  components  with  90  policy  conditions  (spread  over  four  tranches)  rather \nthan  focusing  on  larger  policy-level  actions.  This  led  to  lesser  flexibility  available  for  program \nimplementation  and  in  turn  impacted  the  freedom  available  to  the  implementing  agency  for \nadopting interventions, which were more contextual and pragmatic.23 \n   \nAs such, program implementation is delayed. Nevertheless, both the executing agency \n26. \nand the implementing agency are committed to and remain diligent in implementing the program \nand  continue  to  look  for  ways  to  take  the  program  forward.  However,  external  market  factors \nmade compliance to policy conditions related to the marketing organization, CSP, and the new \nkhadi ventures infeasible.  \n \n27. \nThe government is committed to reform and intends to carry out the reform agenda with \nthe public sector in the absence of an active interest from the private sector. The MMSME has \nreiterated  its  desire  to  continue  the  reform  agenda  in  the  sector  with  the  public  sector  without \ncompromising  the  intent  and  objectives  originally  envisaged  under  the  program,  as  discussed \nwith the ADB team.  \n \nADB has played a critical role as a catalyst and facilitator supporting the reform agenda \n28. \nin  this  traditional  sector  since  its  conceptualization  in  2008.  Given  the  continued  commitment \nand  interest  of  the  government,  ADB  may  continue  to  play  the  role  of  facilitating  this  change \nthrough a restructured program, which is more contextual and aligned to the current social and \neconomic environment. \n \n\n \nEconomic  and  sector.  The  original  due  diligence  conducted  as  part  of  the  loan \n29. \napproval remains intact. The employment generation in the RNS, including the KVI subsector, \n\nV. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\n                                                 \n21 A summary of an initial program impact assessment has been done as part of the revised policy conditions under \n\nthe second tranche. \n\n22 The  program  pioneered  the  transfer  of  benefit  to  artisans  and  weavers  through  a  bank  account,  which  was  later \nsubsumed  within  a  larger  financial  inclusion  agenda  of  the  Government  of  India,  including  Jan  Dhan  Yojna \n(financial inclusion scheme), through a universal identification using biometrics. \n\n23  For  instance,  the  Khadi  Mark  was  specifically  required  to  be  registered  under  the  Trade  Mark  Act  whereas  the \ncurrent Khadi Mark regulation notified under the KVIC Act has achieved the same reform objective. In the case of a \nmarketing  organization,  PPP  was  to  be  done  as  a  joint  venture  with  majority  private  sector  shareholding,  which \nprecluded other options like management contract, concession, and franchising. \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n \n35. \n \n\n \n\nhas  been  impacted  by  the  macroeconomic  changes  and  new  schemes,  specifically  the \nMahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act,24 which was expanded to all rural \nareas by 2008.25  \n \nGovernance. The program continues to address governance issues originally envisaged \n30. \nunder the program. The mainstreaming of financial inclusion and direct benefit transfer scheme \nwill  help  in  further  strengthening  the  governance  of  KVIs  in  the  central  and  state-level  and \nartisan  welfare  since  the  fund  transfer  mechanism  is  transparent  and  the  artisans  are  able  to \nrealize the benefits in short duration. \n \n31. \nPoverty  and  social. The results of the original due diligence conducted as part of the \nloan  approval  remain  valid.  The  program  will  provide  significant  socioeconomic  and  gender-\nrelated impacts to women involved in the khadi subsector. Increased benefits will accrue from \nthe  enhanced  scope  of  the  DRA,  which  will  increase  coverage  from  300  to  400  khadi \ninstitutions.  Women,  who  constitute  80%  of  the  workers  in  the  sector,  will  benefit  from  the \nintervention  in  terms  of  increased  production,  value  addition  to  products,  and  increased  sale \nfrom the renovated retail sales outlets.  \n \n32. \nEnvironment. The original due diligence conducted as part of the loan approval remains \nvalid.  An  environmental  assessment  of  the  policy  matrix  had  indicated  no  potential  adverse \nenvironmental impact. The environment is a category C. \n \n\nVI. \n\nASSURANCE  \n\n \nBased  on  the  revised  development  policy  letter  and  revised  policy  matrix  for  the \n33. \nprogram,  the  government  has  provided  revised  assurances  that  are  incorporated  in  the \namended and restated loan agreement. \n \n\nVII. \n\nTRANCHE 2 RELEASE STATUS \n\nAs  described  in  detail  in  the  Status  of  Policy  Conditions  as  of  28  February  2016,26 the \n\n \n34. \nconditions for revised tranche 2 are fully complied with.   \n \n\nVIII.
