It \nhas  a  population  of  4.5  million  and  contributes  at  least  13%  of  West  Bengal\u2019s  gross  domestic \nproduct.  The  city  is  and  will  remain  the  dominant  commercial  and  financial  hub  in  the  state. \nAlthough its livability has improved, the quality of basic urban services remains below national \nstandards. The gap is particularly noticeable in water supply and sewerage services in regard to \ncoverage,  continuity,  and  quality.  This  affects  the  city\u2019s  ability  to  attract  investment,  facilitate \ntrade, and create jobs, as well as its productivity, its competitiveness, and, most importantly, its \nquality  of  life  and  welfare.  Investment  and  policy  gaps  hinder  how  effectively  and  efficiently \ninstitutions deliver services, and how well the policy framework creates an enabling environment \nfor  better  service  delivery  and  sustainability.  These  limitations  have  been  manageable,  but \nKolkata\u2019s  expanding  economy  and  deficient  investment  and  maintenance  over  the  years  have \nmade  narrowing  the  gaps  more  urgent.  The  Kolkata  Municipal  Corporation  (KMC),  created  to \nadminister the city under the KMC Act in 1980, is responsible for delivering water and sewerage \nservices. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has been working with KMC since 2000, but only \nregarding  sewerage.2 The  partnership  has  yielded  good  results.  KMC  has  a  strategy,  sector \nroad  map,  policy  framework,  and  investment  plan  to  address  gaps  in  operational  efficiency, \ninstitutional  effectiveness,  policy,  and  sustainability. 3  The  investment  program  combines \nphysical  and  other  investments.  KMC  wants  ADB  to  continue  its  role  as  a  key  financing  and \nadvisory partner. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE INVESTMENT PROGRAM \n\nA. \n\nRationale  \n\n3. \nAlthough  water  supply  and  sewerage  service  levels  in  Kolkata  are  above  the  national \naverage,  service  provision  is  not  uniform  across  the  city  and  is  increasingly  strained  by \neconomic  expansion.  As  shown  in  Table  1,  service  is  better  in  the  city  center  than  in  the \nperiphery. This is both a problem and an opportunity. The problem derives from the number of \nvulnerable households that has grown rapidly in the subserviced periphery, while population has \ndeclined in the center. The opportunity arises from the KMC\u2019s ability to generate revenues from \na  still-large  population  with  higher  income  in  the  center,  with  which  to  fund  investment  in  the \nperiphery. The city has worked hard to narrow service disparities. Efforts started with two loans \nprovided  in  2000  and  2006  for  the  Kolkata  Environmental  Improvement  Project  (KEIP),  which \nfinanced the renovation of 564 kilometers (km) of the sewer\u2013drain network and the rehabilitation \nof  three  sewage  treatment  plants,  raising  the  percentage  of  the  population  with  direct  sewer \nconnection  from  31%  in  2001  to  43%  in  2011  (footnote  2).  The  service  coverage  for  water \nsupply is higher than for sewerage, but disparities between central and peripheral areas remain, \n\n                                                 \n1   The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  ADB. 2000.

Unless  addressed  rapidly,  these  disparities  will  widen  as \npopulation shifts from the center to the periphery.4 \n \n\nTable 1: Water Supply and Sewerage Service Delivery in Kolkata \n\nItem \nNational targets \nNational average \nAll KMC area \n\nCentral area \nPeripheral areas \n\nWater \nSupply \nCoverage \n(%) \n100a \n81 \n92 \n100 \n73 \n\nLiters of \nWater \nSupply per \nCapita \n135b\u2013150c \n123 \n134 \n140 \n118 \n\nHours of \nWater \nSupply per \nDay \n24 b \n4 \n8 \n9 \n6 \n\nNonrevenue \nWater  \n(%) \n20 \n\u2026 \n\u2026 \n\u2026 \n\u2026 \n\nMetered water \nconnections \n(%) \n100b \n25 \n0.1 \n\u2026 \n\u2026 \n\nDirect Sewer \nConnection \nCoverage \n(%) \n70a\u2013100b \n28 \n43 \n56 \n19 \n\n\u2026 = data not available, KMC = Kolkata Municipal Corporation. \nNote: The center has 69% of the population and the periphery 31%. \na  As per the Eleventh Five-Year Plan, 2007\u20132012, also applicable under the Twelfth Five-Year Plan, 2012\u20132017. \nb  Ministry of Urban Development. 2010.

Kolkata. \n \n4. \ninadequate investment and maintenance.5 \n\nGaps in service delivery are caused mainly by sub-optimal infrastructure operation and \n\nDelhi. \n\n(i) \n\nOperational  inefficiency  in  water  supply.  Operational  and  management \napproaches are outdated, especially for actively detecting leakage and effecting \nrepairs along the 5,700 km distribution network. High water losses, at 300 million \nliters per day, undermine income. An ADB study in 2012 showed that 63 million \nliters  per  day,  or  65%  of  the  water  supplied  to  a  pilot  zone,  never  reached  end \nusers  (footnote  3).  A  new  water  treatment  plant  is  planned  for  2017  to  address \nsupply shortage in the periphery. The four water treatment plants now operating \nhave  sufficient  design  capacity  to  supply  water  to  meet  national  targets. 6 \nHowever,  for  this  to  happen,  the  KMC  has  to  cut  water  losses  through  better \nmanagement. About 15% of its electromechanical equipment is 30\u201390 years old, \nrequiring  15%  more  energy  than  modern  equipment.  Operational  inefficiency \nmeans high service cost, forgone income, and narrow operating margins. \nLow  investment  in  sewerage.  The  KMC  aims  to  provide  direct  sewer \nconnection to 95% of households over the long term with phased investments in \nat least five additional sewage treatment plants, 17 pumping stations, and 1,300 \nkm  of  sewer\u2013drain  network.  However,  investment  need  greatly  exceeds  the \nKMC\u2019s financial capacity. Timely achievement requires accelerated investment. \nInadequate  revenue.  The  KMC  has  a  dedicated  account  for  water  supply, \nsewerage,  and  drainage.  In  FY2009,  the  account  revenue  reached  $33  million \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n                                                 \n4  Studies have predicted that inadequate sewerage coverage might result in substantial losses by 2050 from flooding \ncaused  by  climate  change  (World  Bank.    2010.  Climate  Risks  and  Adaptation  in  Asian  Coastal  Megacities. \nWashington, DC; World Bank. 2011. India - Vulnerability of Kolkata metropolitan area to increased precipitation in a \nchanging  climate.  Washington  D.C.).  Kolkata\u2019s  vulnerability  arises  from  natural  (topography),  developmental \n(unplanned  and  unregulated  urbanization)  and  climate  change  factors  (rainfall  intensity  and  sea  level  rise). \nTangible  risks  from  increased  floods  include  (i)  loss  of  income  and  personal  assets;  (ii)  damages  to  buildings, \nindustry and commerce; (iii) damage to infrastructure and losses by the public sector; and (iv) health and loss of \nlife. The studies recommended a combination of adaptation measures comprising hard and soft infrastructure. The \ninvestment  program  addresses  some  of  recommended  adaptation  measures  by  critically  increasing  resilience  of \nwater systems and expanding the coverage and capacity of combined sewerage and drainage networks.   \n\n5   Sector  Assessment  (Summary):  Water  Supply  and  Other  Municipal  Infrastructure  and  Services  (accessible  from \n\nthe list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n6  Design capacity is 1,787 million liters per day, but current operational capacity is only 1,260 million liters per day. \n\n\fbut  still  fell  short  of  operating  cost.  A  state  government  subsidy  of  $24  million \nhelped  to  make  ends  meet.7 However,  rising  user  charges  and  property  taxes \nhave  been  the  biggest  contributors  to  revenue. 8  Accordingly,  an  operating \nsurplus of $13 million was recorded in that fiscal year. This surplus and savings \nfrom  the  KMC\u2019s  main  account  helped  fund  $27  million  in  critical  capital \ninvestments over the period but was insufficient to replace and modernize water \nsupply and sewerage facilities. \n\n \nKEIP  performance.  The  KMC  has  the  capacity  to  manage  large  infrastructure \n5. \ninvestments  and  ensure  adequate  fiduciary  oversight.  Although  the  KEIP  (footnote 2)  suffered \nstart-up delays, the KMC remarkably advanced progress from 2006, with more than $30 million \na  year  in  disbursement  from  2007  to  2012  reflecting  its  capacity  and  commitment.9 KEIP  was \nphysically closed on 30 June 2013, after disbursing more than 90% of the cumulative value of \nthe loans.10  \n \n6. \nKMC  has  also  proved  its  capacity  to  implement  complex  projects.  The  KEIP  was \nclassified  category  B  sensitive  for  environment  and  category  A  for  involuntary  resettlement.11 \nThe KMC ably managed the process, conducting environmental assessments prior to the start \nof any works and incorporating environmental and resettlement mitigation measures in bidding \ndocuments.  About  2,900  families  had  been  resettled  by  mid-2012  in  accordance  with  the \nresettlement plan. \n \n7. \nPast  ADB  loans  to  the  KMC  targeted  sewerage  service  but  also  required  the  KMC  to \nintroduce some reforms to water supply. Few covenanted reforms that could not be met in full \nwere the introduction of domestic water meters and water tariffs.12 As part of a phased approach, \nthe KMC took steps to gradually roll out domestic metering with the initial installation of about \n260  water  meters  for  bulk  users  and  in  January  2012,  the  delivery  of  another  150  bulk  water \nmeters.  This  will  help  monitor  and  reduce  water  losses  in  the  trunk  mains  and  increase  water \navailability  and  continuous  flow  of  water  to  end  users,  which  domestic  water  meters  need  to \nfunction  properly.  Domestic  water  meters  will  be  systematically  installed  in  priority  KMC  areas \nas part of the new investment program. After surveying willingness to pay and affordability, the \nKMC  has  introduced  volumetric  water  tariffs  and  sewer  surcharges  for  bulk  domestic, \ninstitutional, commercial, and industrial users. It has drawn up a blueprint for introducing broad \nuser  charges  toward  full  cost  recovery,  and  in  2011,  the  KMC  adopted  a  new  policy  on \noperational sustainability that stipulates the KMC gradually adopting meters for domestic users \nand a tariff from FY2014. \n \n8. \n\nRoad map, investment program, and lending modality. The KMC has defined a road \n\n                                                 \n7   The subsidy paid the salaries of staff deputed from the state government to the KMC. \n8  The  KMC  levies  user  charges  on  institutional,  commercial,  and  industrial  connections  but  not  on  domestic \nconnections.  Instead,  in  the  past  it  has  aimed  to  recover  operating  cost  through  the  property  tax,  in  accordance \nwith the KMC Act. \n\n9  The  details  of  the  lessons  from  the  experience  and  how  they  were  incorporated  in  the  design  of  the  investment \nprogram, as well as detailed capacity assessment, are in appendixes 1 and 2 of the Facility Administration Manual \n(accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n10 Details are in the Summary of Project Performance (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n11 The KEIP was categorized B sensitive in 2006 to reflect  additional flow of sewage into the East Kolkata Wetland. \nThis  decision  was  taken  following  detailed  nutrient  absorption  capacity  studies.  The  wetland  was  listed  in  2002 \nunder the Ramsar Convention of 1971, recognizing it as a \u201cwetland of international importance\u201d for its approach to \ntreating Kolkata\u2019s sewage, efficiently recovering nutrients from the sewage for fish farming and agriculture.  \n\n12  Regarding revised user charges for domestic connections, the KMC could not demonstrate immediate need, as it \n\nwas able to meet operating cost from user charges, property taxes, and state government subsidies. \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\fmap for water supply and sewerage in the Kolkata Urban Sector Investment Plan, 2012\u20132022.13 \nPhysical  investment  amounts  to  $4  billion,  and  other  investment  in  reform,  management  and \noperational improvement, and on-the-job training comes to $20 million. The concomitant policy \nframework  aims  to  create  an  enabling  environment  for  better  operation  and  management \nefficiency  and  revenue  mobilization.  The  Government  of  India,  the  state  government  of  West \nBengal,  and  the  KMC  have  asked  ADB  to  finance  part  of  the  investment  plan,  of  which  the \nKolkata  Environmental  Improvement  Investment  Program  is  a  portion,  through  an  MFF.  The \nMFF  is  justified  because  (i)  the  KMC  has  a  clear  strategy  and  road  map  that  combine \ninvestments and reforms, (ii) the investments are significant but sequenced, and (iii) the MFF is \nbetter suited to help the city than a stand-alone project as it allows the KMC to apply a phased \nprogrammatic  approach  with  a  well-defined  financial  envelope.  Assessments  have  been \nconducted upfront on policy, institution, management, and safeguards aspects.  \n \n9. \nOngoing  external  assistance  in  the  Kolkata  urban  sector.  The  Government  of  the \nUnited Kingdom, through the Department for International Development, extended a \u00a328 million \ngrant to the KMC for capacity building in 2002. The focus was on organizational development, \ne-governance, property tax reform, accounting reform, revenue mobilization from public\u2013private \npartnership, citizen services, and social sector development. Most outputs had been delivered \nby  2011,  improving  KMC\u2019s  governance.  The  investment  program  will  expand  assistance  to \nimprove governance, focusing on financial management in water supply and sewerage services. \n \nStrategic  context.  India\u2019s  draft  country  partnership  strategy,  2013\u2013201714 and  country \n10. \noperations  business  plan,  2013\u20132015 15  emphasize  (i)  support  for  prioritized  investments \ncovering  critical  economic  and  social  urban  infrastructure  development  and  (ii)  piloting  new \napproaches  to  sustainable  urban  development.  ADB\u2019s  assistance  program  aligns  with  India\u2019s \nTwelfth  Five-Year  Plan,  2012\u20132017, 16 which  focuses  on  strengthening  the  five  enablers  for \nurbanization  (governance,  planning, \ninnovation)  and \nemphasizes regional planning, environmental sustainability, and inclusive growth.  \n \nB. \n\nfinancing,  capacity  building,  and \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n11. \nThe impact of the proposed investment program will be improved access to water supply \nand  sanitation  in  KMC.  The  outcome  will  be  improved  water  supply,  sewerage  and  drainage \nservice quality and operational sustainability in selected areas of KMC.  \n \nC. \n\nOutputs \n\nThe  investment  program  aligns  with  ADB\u2019s  Water  Operational  Plan,  2011\u20132020,17 and \n\n12. \ncomprises the following outputs:  \n\n(i)   \n\n(ii)   \n\nInefficient  water  supply  assets  rehabilitated.

Tranche  1  will  help  the \nKMC  narrow  the  geographical  disparity  in  sewerage  service  and  improve  runoff \nin  the  southern  periphery.19 It  will  install  about  12  km  of  sewer  pipes,  pumping \nstations, and 2,300 direct sewer connections. \nFinancial  and  project  management  capacity  further  developed.  Tranche  1 \nwill help the KMC establish the utility finance improvement unit, which will revise \nthe  long-term  cost-recovery  and  subsidy  plan.  Tranche  1  will  help  the  project \nmanagement  unit  (PMU)  transition  into  an  autonomous  entity  capable  of \nimparting \nresource \nmanagement. \n\ninstitutional  knowledge  and  skills, \n\nincluding  human \n\n \n14. \nTranches 2 and 3 will continue supporting the delivery of all outputs, phased in different \nparts  of  the  KMC  area.  They  will  support  the  downstream  expansion  of  the  water  loss \nmanagement  system  in  the  water  supply  network.  Reduced  water  loss  will  allow  the  KMC  to \npostpone  major  capital  investments  in  new  water  production.  To  ensure  continuity,  the  water \nloss  management  unit  staff  will  acquire  water  loss  management  skills  on  the  job.  These \ntranches  will  continue  supporting  the  installation  of  sewer  pipes  and  direct  connections  in  the \neastern  and  western  peripheries  and  the  construction  of  new  sewage  treatment  plants. 22 \nExpanding  the  areas  with  24-hour  water  supply,  reducing  operational  inefficiency,  and  raising \nsewer  network  coverage  will  give  the  KMC  the  necessary  popular  support  to  introduce  user \ncharges for domestic connections.  \n \nD. \n\nInvestment and Financing Plans \n\nThe investment program is estimated to cost $570 million (Table 2).  \n\n15. \n \n\n                                                 \n18 The  utility  finance  management  unit  will  also  revise  the  unit  price  of  bulk  water  supply  under  existing  supply \n\ncontracts between the KMC and adjacent municipalities to sell at prices exceeding production costs. \n\n19 The sewer and drain systems are combined. Improvements will alleviate waterlogging. Future increases in rainfall \n\nintensity will be addressed during the detailed design to strengthen urban resilience under climate change. \n\n22 Technology for reducing greenhouse gas emissions will be adopted to mitigate climate change impacts. \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\nTable 2: Investment Program \n($ million) \n\nItem \nA.

To  ensure  continuity  and  consistency,  consulting  service \ncontracts will be carried out by the same teams throughout the investment program from 2013 \nto  2023  subject  to  favorable  performance  review.  The  initial  loan  will  cover  consulting  service \ncontracts for the first 5 years, and subsequent loans will cover the remaining period. \n \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nA. \n\nTechnical \n\nExtensive technical due diligence undertaken in partnership with the KMC has validated \n20. \nits investment plan and expected outputs. A key water loss management study for a pilot area in \nzone  1  has  shown  that  reducing  losses  depends  on  intensive  leak  detection  and  repairs  in \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\ndiscrete  areas.  Under  each  tranche,  a  contractor  will  first  hydraulically  segregate  the  pipe \nnetwork in a pilot area, further breaking it up into district metered areas. In each district metered \narea,  the  contractor  will  install  meters  for  all  connections,  supply  water  around  the  clock  with \nproper pressure management, actively detect and repair leaks, and optimize the water pressure \nfor daytime and nighttime service. These and other measures will cut water losses to less than \n20%. To achieve these results, the KMC will engage a contractor through a performance-based \npayment contract.25 This approach means that (i) the work performance will be measured as an \nend  result,  such  as  amount  of  water  loss  reduction  in  the  pilot  area,  and  (ii)  the  contract  will \nprovide  multiple  means  and  alternatives  for  achieving  intended  results.  This  approach  is \nrecognized internationally as a reliable way to reduce water losses. \n \nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n21. \nThe  economic  rationale  for  government  intervention  is  strong,  as  the  investment \nprogram  supports  basic  public  services  that  are  a  natural  monopoly  and  require  the \nmanagement of externalities. The calculation of the economic internal rate of return is based on \nscenarios  with  and  without  the  investment  program,  incorporating  least-cost  design.  The \neconomic internal rate of return is estimated at 15.1% for water supply and 15.0% for sewerage, \nboth higher than the economic opportunity cost of capital. \n \nThe investment program will strengthen financial sustainability by avoiding unnecessary \n22. \noperating cost and exploring additional revenue sources. This will enable an operating surplus \nwith  which  to  improve  water  supply  and  sewerage  operations.  The  calculation  of  financial \ninternal  rates  of  return  (FIRRs)  is  based  on  the  revenues  and  expenditures  accruing  from  all \nphysical and other investments. The FIRR is estimated at 8.3% for water supply and 0.3% for \nsewerage. When the water supply and sewerage components are combined, the FIRR is 4.4%, \nwhich exceeds the weighted average cost of capital, estimated at 2.3%.26 \n \nC. \n\nGovernance \n\n23. \nThe  KMC  will  continue  to  use  the  PMU  formed  under  the  KEIP.  It  consists  of  five \nspecialized units with about 90 staff. The PMU has successfully procured and administered 122 \ncontracts in accordance with ADB guidelines. The highest contract value was $25 million. The \nKEIP\u2019s  5-year  average  annual  disbursement  was  the  second  best  in  the  current  urban  sector \nportfolio in India. The KMC established in 2006 anticorruption and governance measures, such \nas  (i)  public  disclosure  of  the  details  of  physical  and  financial  progress  and  the  results  of  all \ntenders  on  the  project  website,  (ii)  public  audits  of  project  works  by  field-level  committees  in \nevery  borough,  and  (iii)  computer-aided  redress  of  public  grievances  with  a  requirement  to \nrespond  within  24  hours  of  receipt.  A  financial  management  assessment  conducted  for  the \ninvestment program did not identify any significant concerns but recommended using an imprest \nsubaccount to accelerate disbursement.  \n \n24. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government and the KMC. Specific policy requirements and supplementary measures \nare described in the facility administration manual.27 \n\n                                                 \n25 ADB  supported  the  KMC\u2019s  preparation  of  a  performance-based  water  loss  management  contract  under  the  TA \n\nproject Preparing Kolkata Environmental Improvement Project II.  \n\n26 Each periodic financing request will reassess demand, least-cost designs, the economic internal rate of return, and \n\nthe FIRR, as specified in the subproject selection criteria of the FFA. \n\n27 Facility Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n\fD. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n25. \nThe investment program will contribute to ongoing and future national and state poverty \nreduction  programs  by  improving  sewerage  services  for  all  households,  poor  and  not.  It  will \nimprove water supply duration in slums and other neighborhoods in the pilot area, enabling all to \nshare  the  same  quality  of  service.28 Tranche  1  activities  are  categorized  as  effective  gender \nmainstreaming. A gender action plan was prepared, outlining activities to bring equitable access \nto water supply and sewerage services, particularly for vulnerable households, including those \nheaded  by  women.  It  includes  concessional  user  charges  and  promotes  the  participation  of \nwomen  in  project  offices  and  among  contractors  and  operators.  Program  works  contracts  will \nfollow core labor standards and require contractors to carry out HIV/AIDS awareness programs \nfor laborers. Contracts for international competitive bidding and the standard bidding documents \nfor  national  competitive  bidding  require  contractors  to  adequately  mitigate  social  impact  in \ncompliance  with  loan  and  project  agreements  and  with  the  principles  of  the  International \nFederation  of  Consulting  Engineers,  doing  so  under  the  supervision  of  the  executing  and \nimplementing agencies and monitored by ADB. \n \nE. \n\nSafeguards \n\n26. \nSafeguard  frameworks,  including  an  environmental  assessment  and  review  framework \nand  a  resettlement  framework,  were  prepared  for  the  investment  program.  As  demonstrated \nunder  the  KEIP,  the  KMC  has  adequate  capacity  and  commitment  to  implement  them. \nConsistent with the safeguard frameworks, initial environmental examinations and resettlement \nplans were prepared for tranche 1 investments. Tranche 1 is categorized B for environment, B \nfor involuntary resettlement, and C for indigenous peoples. Most adverse environmental impacts \nare associated with construction and can be mitigated. Two initial environmental examinations \nwere  prepared,  including  environmental  management  plans,  in  line  with  the  environmental \nassessment and review framework. The acquisition of 350 square meters of land, affecting two \nlandowners, is required under tranche 1. Both owners were consulted and are willing to sell their \nland.  Two  resettlement  plans  were  prepared  to  address  minor  permanent  and  temporary \nimpacts associated with rehabilitation and the laying of pipes for water  supply, sewerage, and \ndrainage, such as disrupted road accessibility and the loss of livelihoods for a few days during \nconstruction, following the resettlement framework. The investment program does not require an \nindigenous peoples planning framework as it is envisaged that all projects under all tranches will \nnot  affect  scheduled  tribes  living  in  Kolkata,  and  none  of  the  proposed  investments  will  affect \nland  belonging  to  scheduled  tribes.  Consultations  were  held  with  stakeholders,  and  safeguard \ndocuments  (environmental  and  involuntary  resettlement  frameworks  and  planning  documents) \nhave  been  disclosed  on  ADB\u2019s  website;  summaries  were  disclosed  in  local  languages  to \naffected  people  and  other  stakeholders.  A  communication  strategy  details  consultations  and \ndisclosure to be undertaken during implementation. \n \nF. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n27.  Major  risks  and  mitigating  measures  are  summarized  in  Table  5  and  presented  in  the \nrisk assessment and risk management plan.29  \n \n\n                                                 \n28 Sustained access to safe water and sanitation will contain waterborne and other diseases, improving public health. \nAn equally significant impact will be a reduction in the time women spend fetching water, disposing of waste, and \ncaring for the sick, thus freeing them for productive activities. \n\n29 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\nTable 5: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \n\nRisks \n10-year  population  growth  and  water  consumption \nsubstantially deviate from the projection. \nRainfall  and  other  climate  variability  do  not  fall \nwithin projected range. \n\nExperienced staff do not stay with the PMU. \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n\nMitigating Measures \n\nThe projection is based on most recent data from \nthe 2011 census, minimizing the extent of errors. \nThe amount of rainfall is based on 10-year \nsamples, so the specifications and design of the \nnetwork will reflect current trends. \nMost staff joined the PMU in 2005 and are \ncommitted to their work, making them likely to stay. \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n\n28. \nThe  governments  of  India  and  West  Bengal  and  the  KMC  have  assured  ADB  that \nimplementation  of  the  project  shall  conform  to  all  applicable  ADB  policies  including  those \nconcerning anticorruption measures, safeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and \ndisbursement as described in detail in the facility administration manual and loan documents. \n \n29. \nThe  governments  of  India  and  West  Bengal  and  the  KMC  have  given  ADB  certain \nundertakings  for  the  MFF,  which  are  set  forth  in  the  FFA.
