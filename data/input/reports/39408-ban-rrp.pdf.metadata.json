(ii) development of \ncompetency and training standards; (iii) development of curricula, \nteacher guides, learning materials and assessment tools; and (iv) \ncapacity development in external competency assessment. \n \nWith  a  view  to  improving  the  capacity  to  deliver  good  quality \ntraining programs, the Project will assist in (i) providing in-service \ntraining  to  government  and  nongovernment  TVET  teachers; \n(ii)  revitalizing  two  public  TVET  teacher  training  institutions;  (iii) \nstrengthening the capacity for short training programs in selected \npublic  and  private  training  institutions;  and  (iv)  strengthening  the \ncapacity  of  the  Directorate  of  Technical  Education  (DTE)  for \nplanning, research, and social marketing.  \n \nTo increase the delivery of relevant skills training, the Project will \nsupport  (i)  the  delivery  of  skills  training  (market-responsive  skills \ntraining) needed in the labor market, and (ii) the delivery of skills \ntraining in poor communities.  \n \nThe TVET system has a large role to play in economic growth and \nsocial development as a provider of (i) trained human resources to \nthe  labor  market  and  (ii)  skills  to  those  looking  for  employment. \n(NPRS) \nBangladesh\u2019s  national  poverty \nrecognizes the potential contribution of TVET to poverty reduction \nwhile supporting economic growth by providing employable skills, \nparticularly  to  those  who  dropped  out  of  school  early  and  are \nalready  of  employable  age,  and  to  the  large  pool  of  unemployed \nand underemployed adults.  \n \n\nreduction  strategy \n\n \nBorrower \n \nClassification \n\n \nEnvironment \nAssessment \n \nProject Description \n\n \nRationale \n\n \n\n\frequirements,  and \n\nThe current formal TVET system lacks linkage with and, therefore, \nrelevance to the labor market. The capacity of the system to meet \nthe needs of the labor market is small. Employers are looking for \nmore  workers  who  can  meet  their  semiskilled  and  skilled \nrequirements. The outputs of the TVET system and the needs of \nthe  employment  sectors  are  mismatched  in  at  least  three  areas: \ntrades  or  occupations  where  programs  are  offered, \n(i) \n(ii)  competencies  acquired  do  not  meet \nindustry  or  self-\n(iii)  practical  experience \nemployment \nopportunities  for  students.  The  practical  component  of  the \ncurriculum is not effectively taught. The majority of TVET teachers \nlack  pedagogical  training  and  practical  skills,  and  have  no \nindustrial  experience.  In  addition,  TVET  institutions  have  poorly \nequipped  workshops;  and  lack  teaching  and  training  materials, \nand adequate classrooms and workshops. \n \nThe  formal  TVET  system  provides  limited  opportunities  to  the \nprimary  target  beneficiaries  of  the  NPRS.  Successful  completion \nof  class  (or  grade)  8  is  required  for  entry  into  formal  TVET \nprograms in the secondary school certificate (vocational) and thus \nexcludes  the  majority  of  the  poor.  Its  main  clientele  are  young \nadolescents who complete class 8, can afford to stay more years \nin school, and have strong white-collar job aspirations.  \n \nThe NPRS calls for a reform of the TVET system to make it more \nmarket-responsive; address training needs of the underprivileged \nwho  do  not  complete  class  8;  collaborate  with  the  private  sector \nand  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs);  and  make  its  training \nprograms  more  flexible  in  terms  of  duration,  curriculum  and \nstudents\u2019 academic qualifications, among others.  \n \nThe Project\u2019s impact will be increased wage- and self-employment \nof  graduates  of  skills  training.  The  Project  supports  the  NPRS  to \nreduce  poverty  and  promote  economic  growth  by  providing \nmarket-relevant skills training to more Bangladeshis, including the \npoor and disadvantaged \n \nThe Project\u2019s envisioned outcome is strengthened capacity of the \nTVET  system  to  provide  market-responsive,  short-term,  relevant \nskills training to more Bangladeshis, including those who have not \ncompleted  class  8.  The  Project  will  be  implemented  throughout \nthe country.  \n \nThe  investment  cost  of  the  Project  is  estimated  at  $66.7  million, \nincluding taxes and duties of $7.8 million.   \n \n\nii \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nImpact and Outcome \n\n \nProject Investment Plan  \n\n\fFinancing Plan \n\n \nPeriod of Utilization \n \nEstimated Project \nCompletion Date \n \nExecuting Agency \n \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\n \nProcurement \n\n \n\n \n\niii\n\nA loan of $50,000,000 in various currencies equivalent to Special \nDrawing  Rights  (SDR)  30,741,000  will  be  provided  from  the \nSpecial  Funds  resources  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB) \nto finance 75% of the project costs. The loan will have a 32-year \nterm including a grace period of 8 years, with an interest charge of \n1%  per  annum  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5%  per  annum \nthereafter. \n \n1 June 2008\u201330 November 2013 \n \n31 May 2013 \n\nimplementation  unit \n\n \nMinistry of Education (MOE) \n \nThe  Directorate  of  Technical  Education  (DTE)  will  be  the \nImplementing  Agency  and  have  overall  responsibility  to  plan, \norganize,  manage,  and  monitor  the  Project,  as  well  as  monitor \nprogress.  The  project \n(PIU)  will  be \nresponsible  for  day-to-day  project  implementation  and  overall \ncoordination among all stakeholders. The PIU will be headed by a \nfull-time  project  director  who  will  be  selected  in  consultation  with \nADB.  An  additional  project  director,  seconded  from  senior  DTE \nstaff, will assume the functions for finance and administration and \npublic\u2013NGO partnership, in addition to duties as overall deputy to \nthe project director.  \n \nA project steering committee (PSC) will be formed and chaired by \nthe  MOE  secretary.  The  PSC  will  be  responsible  for  detailed \npolicy  formulation,  provide  guidance  and  advice  to  the  Project, \nand  approve  the  Project\u2019s  annual  work  plan.  It  will  approve  the \nselection  criteria  for  (i)  TVET  institutions  eligible  for  program \nstrengthening, (ii) market-responsive training proposals eligible for \nproject  support,  (iii)  training  providers  of  the  market-responsive \ntraining programs to be tendered, and (iv) criteria for selecting the \n40 educational institutions that will receive a training workshop. As \nthe  PSC  is  a  large  body  that  can  only  meet  once  a  quarter,  a \nproject implementation committee, chaired by the director general, \nDTE,  will  be  established \nto  oversee  day-to-day  project \nimplementation.  The  project  director  will  act  as  the  committee\u2019s \nmember-secretary.  \n \nProcurement  of  goods  and  services  will  be  in  accordance  with \nADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to \ntime).  Disbursements  will  be  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan \nDisbursement Handbook (2007, as amended from time to time).  \n \n\n \n\n\fiv \n\n \n\nConsulting Services \n\n \nProject Benefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\n \n\ntools \n\nassessment \n\nindependent \n\ndevelopment,  TVET \n\nThe  selection  and  engagement  of  consultants  to  be  financed \nunder the Project will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on \nthe Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). The \nconsultant  services  will  include  about  97  person-months  of \ninternational  consulting  and  260  person-months  of  national \nconsulting.  International  and  national  consulting  services  will  be \nengaged through a firm, to be selected using the quality- and cost-\nbased  selection  method  and  a  full  technical  proposal,  in  the \nfollowing specializations: TVET policy and competency standards \ndevelopment,  competency-based  training  curriculum,  materials, \nand \ninstitution \nstrengthening, TVET teacher training and planning, TVET training \nprogram  design  and  packaging,  training  financing  management \ndesign,  training  needs  assessment,  gender  and  indigenous \npeople,  and  procurement  and    financial  management.  The \nexternal \nfinancial  assessment  and  external \nindependent performance assessment specialists will be recruited \nindividually. \n \nIn  general,  the  Project  will  initiate  reform-oriented  processes  of \nTVET  system  operations  to  make  TVET  more  demand-driven, \nflexible, and oriented to serving the poor and disadvantaged. The \npilot  model  on  public\u2013private  sector  collaboration  will  establish  a \nlinkage  between  TVET  authorities  and  training  providers,  and \nformal  and  informal  employment  markets,  thus  minimizing  the \nmismatch  between  supply  and  demand \nlabor.  The \ndevelopment  and  use  of  competency  standards  approved  or \nrecognized by industry will introduce a new approach to the TVET \nsystem  to  give  more  value  to  actual  competencies  acquired  than \nto  traditional  qualifications.  Revitalization  of  the  two  public  TVET \nteacher  training  institutions  will  support  an  expanded  teacher \ntraining  system  that  serve  the  preservice  and  in-service  teacher \ntraining  needs  of  the  government  TVET  sector,  and  those  of \nprivate  and  nongovernment  training  providers.  In-service  training \nof  TVET  teachers  addresses  the  immediate  need  of  TVET \nproviders to provide untrained teachers with both pedagogical and \ntechnological  skills;  this  will  contribute  to  improving  the  quality  of \nskills training delivery.   \n \nThe  Project  will  help  increase  access  to  skills  training  for  the \nlarger  segment  of  Bangladesh\u2019s  population.  The  development  of \nshort,  modular  competency-based  training  (CBT)  courses  will \nprovide greater flexibility in terms of duration and required student \nacademic  qualifications.  Offering \ntraining  programs  not \nnecessarily  requiring  class  8  for  enrolment  will expand  access  to \nthe  TVET  system  to  those  that  did  not  attain  this  level  of \neducation,  many  of  whom  are  poor.  Training  workshops  in \nselected  poor  communities  will  make  training  more  accessible. \nThus, the Project will open TVET institutions to a larger number of \ntrainees  in  short  CBT  courses,  most  of  whom  would  have  been \ndenied access because of the class 8 requirement for entry. \n\nfor \n\n\f \n\n \nRisks and Assumptions \n\n  v\n\nEconomic  benefits  of  the  Project  are  derived  mainly  from \n(i)  increased  access  to  skills  training  as  a  result  of  developing \nshort,  modular  CBT  courses;  training  delivery  support;  and \nprogram  strengthening  of  selected  TVET \ninstitutions;  and \n(ii)  improved  relevance  and  quality  of  skills  training  through \npartnerships  with  employers,  industry,  and  NGOs;  the  related \nrevision  of  curricula;  and  provision  of  in-service  teacher  training. \nThe Project will have about 68,200 trainees over the five years of \nimplementation.  The  program  strengthening  of  TVET  institutions \nwill expand  the intake capacity of beneficiary training institutions. \nAfter  the  completion  of  their  training,  graduates  are  expected  to \nseek local or international employment or be self-employed. With \nthe  combined  efforts  to  increase  access  to  short-term  skills \ntraining  programs  and  improve  their  relevance  and  quality,  the \nproportion  of  trainees  employed  from  Project-supported  training \nprograms is expected to improve. Although they are not the target \nbeneficiaries of the Project, improving the quality of teaching and \npractical  training  in  vocational  subjects  is  also  expected  to \nimprove the examination pass rates and employment likelihood of \nsecondary school students in the vocational stream. Under these \nassumptions,  the  economic  internal  rate  of  return  is  estimated  at \n13.9% in the base-case scenario.    \n \nThe  partnership  model  assumes  the  continued  commitment  and \ncooperation of the three partner industry associations and NGOs \nin  the  sector  working  committees  (SWCs).  Thus,  the  Project  will \nsign  memoranda  of  understanding  and  provide  strengthening \nactivities to SWC members. The three focus industries and NGOs \nare  eligible  for  training  partnership  assistance  and  their  training \nrequirements  will  be  supported  through  the  provision  of  market-\nresponsive  skills  training.  In  addition,  the  policy  development \nactivities  of  the  European  Commission  and  International  Labour \n(EC\u2013ILO  project),  which  will  be  concurrently \nOrganization \nimplemented, will reinforce linkages with industry and coordination \nof TVET-related government agencies. \n \nImplementation of the Project\u2019s capacity development for external \ncompetency  assessment \nlearning \nthat  will \nassumes  that  the  EC\u2013ILO  project  activity  to  develop  the  related \npolicy and system will be at an advanced stage by the end of the \nProject\u2019s  second  year  of  implementation.  The  Project  will  closely \ncoordinate  with \nis \nthe  EC\u2013ILO  project  and, \nexperienced  in  that  project,  the  Project\u2019s  specialists  in  TVET \npolicy  and  competency  standards  development  and  CBT \ncurriculum, materials and assessment tools development will help \nprepare the draft of the relevant policy and its supporting system.  \n \nThe  Project  aims  to  provide  in-service  training  to  about  4,000 \nuntrained TVET teachers from public and private TVET providers. \nHowever,  substitute  teachers  may  not  be  available  while  the \nuntrained  teachers  are  on  training.  This  will  be  addressed  by \n\nrecognize  prior \n\nif  any  delay \n\n \n\n\fmaking  the  training  program  modular,  short,  and  continuing;  and \nscheduling  teacher  training  when  student  training  programs  are \nnot  in  session.  The  Project\u2019s  loan  assurances  provide  for \ncertification by the Bangladesh Technical Education Board of the \nin-service  teacher  training.  EC\u2013ILO  activities  in  TVET  teacher \nqualifications  and  teacher  strengthening  will  complement  this \nactivity.  \n \nThe  limited  scope  of  activities  in  the  two  public  TVET  teacher \ntraining  institutions  contributed  to  past  underutilization.  The  new \napproach  to  include  a  multiparty  advisory  board;  in-service \noutreach  training;  and  training  of  staff  from  private  and  NGO \nsectors, and other ministries will help increase utilization of TVET \nfacilities.  Management  training  for  administrators  will  facilitate \naddressing  the  training  needs  of  non-MOE  staff.  Complementary \ninputs  from  the  Project  (facilities  and  staff  development)  and  the \nEC\u2013ILO  project  (policies  and  capacity  strengthening)  will  support \nimprovements in the quality and relevance of TVET, which should \nmaintain  the  demand  for  the  preservice  and  in-service  TVET \nteacher training programs.     \n \nThe  pace  of  implementation  of  market-responsive  skills  training \nwill depend on the PIU\u2019s capacity to identify priority and/or urgent \ntraining  needs,  package  the  corresponding  training  programs  for \ntendering, and administer training contracts. To minimize the risk \nof  delays,  the  Project  will  provide  an  adequate  number  of  highly \nqualified  staff,  including  for  contracts  administration,  in  the  PIU \nand give support to the evaluation committees. The PIU will also \ninternational  and  national  consultants \nbe  supported  by \nspecializing  in  training  financing  management  design,  training \nprogram design and packaging, and financial management.  \n \n\nvi \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n1. \nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  Bangladesh  for  the  Skills  Development  Project.  (The  design  and \nmonitoring framework is in Appendix 1). \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES1 \n\nDespite  the  calamities  that  hit  the  country  almost  every  year,  Bangladesh\u2018s  economic \n2. \ngrowth  averaged  5.7%  per  annum  from  2000  to  2006. 2   Nonetheless,  about  half  of  the \npopulation  lives  below  the  national  poverty  line.  While  agriculture  engages  the  majority  of  the \npopulation, its share in gross domestic product (GDP) is declining. Sources of economic growth \nare shifting gradually to the higher productivity industry and services sectors. Economic growth \nhas  been  fueled  largely  by  export-oriented  industries,  mainly  textiles  and  garments,  which \naccounted for about 72% of total export earnings in 2004. Other industries experiencing robust \ngrowth  include  leather,  leather  goods,  and  construction.  In  the  services  sector,  the  industries \nposting significant growth rates include post and telecommunication, land transport, wholesale \nand  retail  trade,  and  hotels  and  restaurants.  The  national  economy  is  buoyed  by  remittances \nfrom overseas Bangladeshi workers; in 2006 remittances made up the second largest source of \nforeign exchange.   \n \n3. \nEconomic  growth  combined  with  the  Government\u2019s  pro-poor  policies  and  programs \nresulted  in  significant  improvement  of  some  human  development  indicators,  notably  reduced \ninfant and maternal mortality, increased net school enrollment ratio, and achievement of gender \nparity in primary education. Primary enrollment has more than tripled since 1970 from 5.3 million \nto about 16.2 million in 2005, and the proportion of female enrollees has increased from 32% to \n50%. In 2005, the gross enrollment rate for primary education was about 93.7%.   \n \nOver  half  of  Bangladesh\u2019s  working  age  population  was  in  the  labor  force  in  2003. \n4. \nWomen\u2019s labor force participation has increased notably from 1996, particularly in rural areas. \nOf those employed locally, about 80% were in the informal sector and mainly self-employed or \nday  laborers;  only  14%  were  engaged  in  wage-employment.  Most  employment  is  still  in \nagriculture,  forestry,  and  related  works  (49%),  followed  by  wholesale  and  retail  trade  and \nmanufacturing. Other relatively large employers include transport, storage, and communication \nservice;  community,  personal  service,  and  household  sector;  construction;  and  education \nservices.  More  Bangladeshis  are  seeking  employment  outside  the  country,  but  their  share  of \nemployment opportunities is small. While about half of these workers are unskilled, the number \nof semiskilled and skilled workers among those deployed is growing.  \n \n5. \nAchieving  accelerated  poverty  reduction  and  related  Millennium  Development  Goal \ntargets  would  require  Bangladesh\u2019s  economy  to  grow  by  7%\u20138%  per  annum. 3   Significant \ninvestment is required to achieve this. Attracting investments will require improving governance \nand streamlining bureaucratic rules and regulations, and upgrading the skills and competencies \nof  human  resources.  The  national  poverty  reduction  strategy  (NPRS)  recognizes  the  potential \ncontribution of technical and vocational education and training (TVET) in reducing poverty while \nsupporting  economic  growth.  TVET  provides  practical  job  skills,  particularly  to  those  who \ndropped  out  of  school  early  and  are  already  of  employable  age,  and  to  the  large  pool  of \n\n                                                 \n1   Asian Development Bank (ADB) 2006.

The  NPRS  calls  for  reform  of  the  TVET  system  to \nmake it more market-responsive; address the training needs of the underprivileged who do not \ncomplete  class  (or  grade)  8;  collaborate  with  the  private  sector  and  nongovernment \norganizations  (NGOs);  and  make  its  training  programs  more  flexible  in  terms  of  duration, \ncurriculum,  and  students\u2019  academic  qualifications,  among  others.  Appendix  2  provides  an \nanalysis of the TVET subsector. \n\nA. \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\nIn 2006, the World Bank conducted a tracer study involving more than 2,300 graduates \n6. \nof  basic  trade,  certificate  and  diploma  courses  of  public  and  private  TVET  institutions.  The \nhighest proportions of employed were among the higher secondary certificate (vocational) (HSC \n[Voc])  graduates  at  30%,  followed  by  diploma  graduates  at  21%,  and  basic  trades  at  18%. \nThese  courses,  however,  account  for  only  a  small  proportion  of  total  formal  TVET  enrollment. \nThe  lowest  proportions  of  employed  were  among  the  secondary  school  certificate  (vocational) \n(SSC  [Voc])  graduates  (4%)  and  higher  secondary  certificate  (business  management) \ngraduates (5%), which also had the highest proportion of graduates pursuing further education. \n \n7. \nDuring  the  focus  group  discussions  and  interviews  in  the  preparation  of  this  Project, \nemployers  in  ready-made  garments  and  textiles,  light  engineering,  and  construction  said \nworkers with the required skills were not readily available in the market. The shortage is keenly \nfelt  particularly  in  construction  and  light  engineering  industries, as  many  of  their  skilled \nworkers have sought employment out of the country. Training for their replacements takes time \nand is costly. In the case of ready-made garments, the shortage is caused mainly by sustained \nhigh growth in  product  demand,  requiring  rapid expansion  of  production  capacity. Because  the \nwork is labor-intensive, this entails hiring a large number of  workers within a short time, which \noften results in poaching workers from other garment firms.  \n\nB.  \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\n8. \nNeed to Improve Relevance. A major weakness of the current TVET system is its lack \nof  linkage,  and  therefore  relevance,  to  the  labor  market,  i.e.,  the  formal  industry  subsectors, \ninformal  self-employment  subsector,  and  international  employment.  Mismatches  between \noutputs of the TVET system and needs of employers include (i) types of trades or occupations \nwhere programs being offered, (ii) competencies acquired compared with industry requirements \nor  needs  for  self-employment  opportunities,  and  (iii)  practical  experience  opportunities  for \nstudents.  The  identification  of  courses  is  not  based  on  regular  and  systematic  assessment  of \nlabor  market  needs.  Even  if  the  curricular  offerings  match  market  needs,  the  competency \nacquired  may  not  match  industry  requirements.  Employers  have  minimal  input  in  setting \ncompetency  standards,  determining  the  curriculum,  developing  the  testing  and  certification \nsystem,  and  managing  certain  training  institutions,  among  others.  There  is  wide  scope  for \nengaging industries in the TVET system, which has been barely tapped. During the consultation \nworkshop  and  interviews  to  prepare  the  Project,  industry  leaders  expressed  willingness  to \ncooperate  with  TVET  system  authorities.  The  international  labor  market  is  large  but  highly \ncompetitive.  About  half  of  the  current  deployment  of  Bangladeshi  workers  is  made  up  of \nunskilled  laborers.  An  effective  TVET  system  can  increase  the  proportion  of  semiskilled  and \nskilled  workers  by  using  industry-recognized  and  internationally  benchmarked  competency \nstandards and training systems. TVET can be made more relevant to the informal sector, too, \nby  such  activities  as  upgrading  skills  in  certain occupations.  A  number  of  NGOs  have  training \nprograms catering to the informal rural subsector that are achieving high placement rates.  \n\n9. \nNeed  to  Improve  Access.  The  existing  formal  TVET  system  provides  limited \nopportunities  to  target  beneficiaries  of  the  NPRS\u2014the  underprivileged  who  do  not  complete \n\n\f  3\n\nclass 8. Its main clientele are young adolescent males who complete class 8, can afford to stay \nmore  years  in  school,  and  have  strong  white-collar  job  aspirations.  The  minimum  entry \nrequirement  to  the  lowest  formal  qualifications,  basic  skill  standard  certificate  (national  skills \nstandard-basic)  and  national  skill  certificate  III  (national  skills  standard  III),  which  is  class  8, \nautomatically excludes the large majority who do not achieve it. Promoting female enrolment in \nnontraditional  trades  is  also  needed.  Until  very  recently,  the  lack  of  formal  recognition  by  the \nBangladesh  Technical  Education  Board  (BTEB)  of  successful  NGO-  and  industry-delivered \nshort  programs  inhibited  their  expansion.  Good  quality  competency-based  training  (CBT) \nmodular  courses  offer  the  best  vehicle  for  the  TVET  system  to  reach  out  to  the  poor.  Short \ncourses  would  be  more  affordable  for  trainees  than  the  2-year  SSC  (Voc)  programs.  Opening \nup TVET to the older poor by offering short CBT courses that do not necessarily require class 8 \nfor enrolment will increase TVET output, improve utilization of facilities, reduce unit costs, and \nmake the system more relevant.  \n\n10. \nNeed  to  Improve  Quality  and  Capacity.  The  pass  rate  of  students  in  the  terminal \nexternal examination, conducted by BTEB, to a large extent reflects the quality of education and \ntraining. One of the major constraints to effective TVET delivery is the lack of trained teachers. \nThe  majority  of  TVET  teachers  have  little  pedagogical  training,  including  in  CBT  delivery;  lack \npractical  skills;  and  have  little  or  no  industry  experience.  TVET  teachers  are  interested  in \nobtaining in-service training, and BTEB is considering pedagogical and technological training of \nTVET  teachers  as  a  requirement  for  the  registration  of  private  TVET  institutions.  The  country \nneeds  a  TVET  teacher  training  system  that  will  provide  preservice  training  and,  more \nimportantly,  will  quickly  and  effectively  provide  teacher  upgrading  and  introduce  new  curricula \nand  teaching  methodologies.  The  current  TVET  teacher  training  capacity  in  the  country  is \nlimited.  The  two  public  TVET  teachers\u2019  training  institutions,  i.e.,  Technical  Teachers  Training \nCollege (TTTC) in Dhaka for diploma and degree programs and Vocational Teachers Training \nInstitute (VTTI) in Bogra for diploma and certificate programs, presently serve only the needs of \nMinistry of Education (MOE) TVET institutions. Their facilities need upgrading and they need to \nsupport non-MOE TVET institutions, including government, nongovernment, and private.  \n\n11. \nThe lack of trained teachers is compounded by the fact that the majority of private and \nsome  government  TVET  institutions  have  poorly  equipped  workshops  and  laboratories,  lack \nteaching  and  training  materials,  and  have  inadequate  classrooms  and  libraries.  Consequently, \nthe practical component of the curriculum is not effectively taught. The formal TVET system has \nminimal  capacity  to  meet  the  needs  of  the  labor  market.  Some  TVET  institutions  require \nsubstantial capital investments to increase their capacity to deliver short CBT programs.  \n\nLessons.  Lessons from activities in skills training supported by the Asian Development \n12. \nBank  (ADB) 4   and  other  development  partners  were  considered  in  the  project  design.  The \nProject  will  actively  involve  representatives  of  industries,  employers,  and  NGOs  in  identifying \noccupational  areas  that are  in  demand,  in  developing  competencies  for  the  market-demanded \noccupational areas; and work with BTEB to develop the curricula and learning materials. Skills \ntraining  curricula  will  be  competency-based  and  adapt  internationally  and  locally  available \nmaterials,  as  appropriate.  Since  many  skills  are  common  internationally,  CBT  materials  are \nreadily  available,  and  model  programs  in  the  country  have  excellent  CBT  material,  a  policy  of \n\u201cacquire,  validate,  adopt,  adapt  the  best\u201d  is  recommended  for  most  curricula.  The  proposed \nProject  pilots  the  use  of  a  pool  of  funds  for  training  delivery.  The  use  of  training  funds  can \nencourage  flexible  reallocation  of  training  resources  to  high-priority  economic  activities  and \n\n                                                 \n4   ADB.  1999.

The Project\u2019s training programs \nwill  be  based  on  the  requirements  of  the  Project\u2019s  focus  industries.  In  the  communities,  the \nGovernment  will  work  with  NGOs  to  assess  training  needs.  After  conducting  some  training \nprograms  and  before  project  completion,  tracer  studies  of  the  trainees  will  be  commissioned. \nThe Project will strengthen the capacity of Directorate of Technical Education (DTE) and project \nimplementation  unit  (PIU)  personnel  to  analyze  labor  market  demand.  Appendix  3  discusses \nlessons applied to the project design. \n\ninterested \n\nAid  Coordination.  The  development  assistance  community \n\nin  skills \n13. \ndevelopment  in  Bangladesh  has  established  a  donor  coordinating  committee; 5   senior  MOE \nofficers  attend  the  committee  meetings.  Appendix  4  describes  current  support  to  government \nTVET-related projects. In defining the project components, due consideration was given to the \nplanned  activities  of  the  development  partners  in  the  subsector,  specifically  the  European \nCommission  project  being  implemented  by  the  International  Labour  Organization.  This  project \ninvolves  mostly  policy  reform:  (i)  unified  policy  and  governance  framework,  (ii)  national \nqualifications  framework,  (iii)  TVET  qualifications  framework,  (iv)  TVET  teacher  qualifications \nframework,  (v)  registration  and  accreditation  system,  (vi)  testing  and  certification  system,  \n(vii)  internal  quality  assurance  system  for  regulatory  bodies,  and  (viii)  apprenticeship  system. \nThe  European  Commission  and  International  Labour  Organization  (EC\u2013ILO)  project  and  the \nproposed ADB Project are the first large assistance to TVET in Bangladesh in over a decade.\n\n14. \nADB  Country  Strategy.  ADB  is  a  long-time  partner  of  the  Government  in  human \nresource development. The ADB country strategy for the education sector and TVET for 2006\u2013\n2010  focuses  on  providing  assistance  to  children  and  youth  who  are  in  school  or  have  left \nschool (Appendix 4). ADB is providing assistance to increase access and improve the quality of \nprimary and secondary education. For those who have left formal education, ADB is providing \nassistance  for  postliteracy  and  continuing  education  activities.  The  proposed  Project  will  be \nADB\u2019s first assistance to the country\u2019s TVET subsector and is envisioned to be the beginning of \na long-term engagement in it. The proposed Project responds to the country\u2019s immediate needs \nas expressed in the NPRS and complements ADB assistance to general education. It aims to \nimprove  the  marketable  skills  of  school  leavers  by  improving  the  flexibility  and  market-\nresponsiveness  of  skills  training,  and  by  addressing  the  skills  requirements  of  the  informal \nsector. These will facilitate income generation through market employment or self-employment.  \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n15. \nThe Project\u2019s impact will be increased wage- and self-employment of graduates of skills \ntraining,  locally  and  internationally.  The  Project  supports  the  Government\u2019s  NPRS  to  reduce \npoverty  and  promote  economic  growth  by  providing  market-relevant  skills  training  to  more \nBangladeshis,  including  the  poor  and  disadvantaged.  The  Project\u2019s  envisioned  outcome  is \nstrengthened  capacity  of  the  TVET  system  to  provide  market-responsive,  short-term,  relevant \nskills  training  to  more  Bangladeshis,  including  those  who  have  not  completed  class  8.  The \nProject will be implemented throughout the country.  \n\n                                                 \n5   The  committee  members  include  ADB,  Australian  Agency  for  International  Development,  Canadian  International \nDevelopment  Agency,  Department  for  International  Development,  European  Commission,  Deutsche  Gesellschaft \nf\u00fcr  Technische  Zusammenarbeit, \nIslamic  Development  Bank,  Japan \nInternational  Cooperation  Agency,  Japan  Overseas  Cooperation  Volunteers,  Korea  International  Cooperation \nAgency,  Swiss  Agency  for  Development  Cooperation,  United  States  Agency  for  International  Development,  and \nWorld Bank.\n\nInternational  Labour  Organization, \n\n\f  5\n\nB. \n\nOutputs \n\n16. \nThe  Project  adopts  a  market-responsive  approach  and  will  have  four  outputs:  (i) \nenhanced  relevance  and  access  of  TVET  programs;  (ii)  improved  capacity  for  good  quality \nTVET  delivery;  (iii)  relevant  skills  training,  including  to  the  poor,  women,  and  disadvantaged \ngroups;  and  (iv)  project  management.  The  focus  will  be  on  assisting  and  improving  the \ndevelopment and delivery of short skills training programs that will not necessarily require class \n8 completion or admission into the SSC (Voc) program.  \n \n\n1.  \n\nEnhanced Relevance and Access of TVET Programs  \n\n17. \nThis  component  aims  to  enhance  the  relevance  of  training  programs  by  improving \nlinkages  to  the  labor  market,  and  to  increase  access  by  developing  short  CBT  programs.  The \nProject will pilot the development of a partnership mechanism with three industries: ready-made \ngarments  and  textiles,  light  engineering,  and  construction.  Their  selection  is  based  on  their \nrelative  importance  to  the  economy  in  terms  of  employment  generation,  contribution  to  the \nnational  output,  future  growth  prospects,  availability  of  a  formal  industry  association,  and \ninterest  in  workforce  training.  The  Government  will  work  with  representatives  of  the  three \nindustries and the informal sector (Appendix 5) to determine their specific skills training needs. \nThe  outputs  are  (i)  partnerships  with  industry  established;  (ii)  competency  and  training \nstandards  developed;  (iii)  curricula,  teacher  guides,  learning  materials  and  assessment  tools \ndeveloped; and (iv) capacity in external competency assessment developed. \n\n18. \nPartnerships  with  Industry  Established.  The  Project  will  support  establishment  and \noperation  of  a  sector  working  committee  (SWC)  in  each  of  the  three  major  industries  and  the \ninformal sector. Each industry SWC will comprise 8\u201312 technically knowledgeable experts from \nthe industry\u2019s largest member associations. The informal sector SWC will comprise experts from \nthe  largest  and  most  successful  NGOs  delivering  skills  training  in  Bangladesh.  To  ensure \ncoordination  and  provide  support  to  the  SWCs,  a  forum  of  skill  development  partners  will  be \nestablished  comprising  heads  of  the  four  SWCs,  heads  of  the  largest  industry  associations  in \nthe three focus industries, and the head of the lead NGO in the informal sector SWC. The forum \nwill  interact  with  the  BTEB  chairperson  and  members,  and  other  TVET  stakeholders.  SWC \nmembers  will  benefit  from  regional  and  national  capacity  building  activities  in  needs \nassessments,  competency  standards  development,  and  public-private  partnerships,  including \non international experiences for relevant government officials and industry representatives.  \n\n19. \nCompetency  and  Training  Standards  Developed.  Each  SWC  will  identify  10  priority \noccupations  (40  in  total)6  for  the  development  and  dissemination  of  competency  and  training \nstandards. Depending on the demand within the 40 priority occupations, the Project will support \nthe development of about 100 competency standards by SWCs, most likely for basic trade and \nnational  skills  standard  III.  The  standards 7   will  be  approved  by  their  respective  industry \nstakeholders and endorsed to BTEB for its approval. For the approved competency standards, \nthe  SWCs,  in  coordination  with  BTEB\u2019s  curriculum  development  committees,  will  specify  the \ntraining  standards  necessary  to  attain  the  competencies.  The  training  standards  will  include \nspecifications for training duration, number and qualifications of instructors, teaching materials, \nand assessment method.  \n \n\n                                                 \n6   Some of the likely occupational areas are (i) in ready-made garments, sewing machine operation, pattern-making \nand  cutting,  and  weaving  and  knitting  machines  operation;  (ii)  in  light  engineering,  computer  numerical  control  \n(CNC)  machine  operation,  machine  tools  operation  and  tools  and  die  making;  and  (iii)  in  construction,  plumbing, \nwelding, masonry, carpentry, and heavy equipment. \n\n7   Foreign competency standards can be adapted, validated, and adopted for Bangladesh. \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\nCurricula, Teacher Guides, Learning Materials and Assessment Tools Developed. \n20. \nWith support of the Project, BTEB, in coordination with the SWCs, will develop the related CBT \ncurricula, teacher guides, learning materials and assessment tools for the approved competency \nstandards. Course curricula to be developed through the Project8 will include (i) about 20 short \npost-SSC  (Voc)  enhancement  courses  to  remedy  deficiencies  in  the  skills  component  of  the \nSSC(Voc),  and  target  school  leavers  seeking  immediate  vocational  employment;  (ii)  about  10 \nindustry-specific courses at different levels; (iii) about 40 short, modular CBT courses based on \nthe approved competency standards; and (iv) about 20 existing effective short courses provided \nby  NGOs  that  will  be  transformed  using  the  CBT  format.  These  training  courses  will  not \nnecessarily require class 8 as an admission requirement.  \n\n21. \nFour curriculum development committees, one counterpart for each SWC and chaired by \na  senior  BTEB  staff,  will  be  organized  under  BTEB\u2019s  Curriculum  Development  Wing.  To \nsupplement the limited number of regular BTEB staff available for the committees, the Project \nwill  support  recruitment  of  national  experts,  including  from  universities,  colleges,  and  training \ninstitutes. The Project will support additional BTEB curriculum development specialists, support \nstaff,  and  national  experts;  office  equipment  and  software;  and  local  and  international  staff \ntraining in developing CBT curricula, learning materials, and assessment tools. Where deemed \nnecessary,  the  Project  will  support  up  to  two  people  for  about  six  official  bilateral  negotiation \ntrips  to  negotiate  for  the  acceptance  of  Bangladesh\u2019s  skill  certificates  and  competency \nstandards by major international destinations of Bangladesh workers.  \n\n22. \nCapacity for External Competency Assessment Developed. The Project will support \nimplementation  of  an  external  skills  assessment  and  certification  system  for  individuals \ninterested in being assessed and certified. The EC\u2013ILO project will develop this system, which \nwill include the recognition of prior learning. The Project will initially support the training of about \n200  competency  assessors,9  nominated  from  industry  associations  and  BTEB,  in  trade  areas \nwhere the SWCs develop competency standards. The international and national consultants on \nstandards  development  and  curriculum  development  will  develop  and  conduct  the  training \nprogram  for  assessors.  An  assessment  guideline  and  procedure  manual  will  be  developed  to \nensure  uniform  and  proper  observance  of  the  process.  BTEB  will  issue  a  skills  certificate  to \nsuccessful  candidates  of  the  competency  assessment,  and  maintain  a  registry  of  certified \ncompetency  assessors. To  build  the  capacity  of  key  personnel  and  stakeholders, international \ncapacity building activities will be undertaken to learn from other countries' external competency \nassessment systems.  \n \n\n2.  \n\nImproved Capacity for Good Quality TVET Delivery \n\n23. \nThis  component  aims  to  improve  the  capacity  for  delivering  training  programs  with \nimproved quality by (i) providing in-service training to TVET teachers; (ii) revitalizing two existing \nTVET  teacher  training  institutions;  (iii)  strengthening  the  capacity  for  short  CBT  programs  in \nselected  public  and  private  training  institutions;  and  (iv)  strengthening  the  capacity  of  DTE  for \nplanning,  research,  and  social  marketing.  The  Project  will  pilot  assistance  to  strengthen  short \ntraining  programs  in  private  TVET  institutions,  and  to  undertake  training  partnerships  with \nindustry associations in the SWCs.     \n\n24. \nIn-Service Training Provided to TVET Teachers. The Project will address the skill and \ntraining  needs  of  current  TVET  teachers,  regardless  of  the  employer,  particularly  in  pedagogy \n\n                                                 \n8   The  Project  will  support  the  acquisition  of  sample  curricula,  guides,  and  assessment  materials;  secretariat; \nmeetings  and  workshops;  capacity  strengthening,  consultants  and  resource  persons;  printing  and  distribution \ncosts; circulation and information dissemination; validation; and pilot testing. \n\n9   Some of the assessors may be qualified to assess in more than one occupational area. \n\n\f  7\n\nand CBT. The Project will assess TVET teacher training needs; prepare a TVET teacher training \nplan,  including  a  monitoring  and  evaluation  plan;  and  develop  and  provide  in-service  teacher \ntraining  modules.10  About  4,000  TVET  teachers  will  be  introduced  to  CBT,  new  curricula,  and \ninstructional  methodology  changes  including  short  modular  courses;  and  2,500  will  receive \ntraining  to  improve  their  technological  skills.  Trainers  will  be  employed  and  trained;  related \nteacher  training  packages  will  be  developed.  The  EC\u2013ILO  project  will  review  and  modernize \nteacher college programs (certificate and diploma programs). The Project will complement this \nEC\u2013ILO activity by supporting its pilot delivery in a flexible manner, including through part-time \nprograms, to about 1,000 TVET teachers. To strengthen the technical capacity in TVET teacher \ntraining, local and international training in pedagogy and technological skills will be provided to \nmaster  trainers.  To  coordinate  and  provide  regional  support  to  the  training  of  teachers,  the \nProject will support the establishment of eight regional offices. Teacher training support officers \nwill provide follow-up technical advice to trained TVET teachers. Regional office staff will receive \nlocal training in management, office software and procedures, and financial management.  \n\n25. \nTeacher  Training  Facilities  Upgraded.  To  revitalize  and  deliver  increased  in-service \nTVET  teacher  training  to  government  and  nongovernment  TVET  teachers,  the  Project  will \nupgrade  VTTI  and  TTTC  as  central  facilities  and  resources  for  TVET  teachers\u2019  in-service \ntraining programs. The Project will assist DTE in updating and revising the redevelopment plans \n(5-year  development  plan)  for  VTTI  and  TTTC  to  (i)  expand  the  scope  of  the  institutions,  (ii) \ninclude  a  multiparty  advisory  board,  (iii)  increase  enrollment  through  part-time  and  multimedia \ndelivery  modes,  (iv)  support  and  emphasize  in-service  TVET  teacher  training  on  an  outreach \nbasis and using mass media, (v) encourage excellence, and (vi) serve personnel of ministries \nother  than  MOE  and  the  private  and  NGO  sectors.  The  upgrading  of  VTTI  and  TTTC  will  be \ncontingent on ADB approval of the revised 5-year development plans, which will include specific \nperformance targets. Each facility will be the center for trainers of master teacher-trainers, have \na  curricula  modernization  cell  dedicated  to  adapting/developing  new  training  techniques  and \nmultimedia  materials,  and  undertake  impact  assessment  studies  of  its  training  programs.  The \nProject  will  provide  for  civil  works,  equipment,  furniture,  books  and  journals,  learning  and \ntraining  materials  (including  e-learning),  workshops,  conference,  attendance  of \nforeign \nworkshops  and  conferences,  local  and  international  staff  development,  research  funds,  and \nresource  persons.  Local  training  in  institutional  management,  training  needs  assessment,  and \npublic\u2013private partnerships will be provided to administrators and senior officials. To learn about \nthe practices and experiences of similar institutions abroad, an international study tour of such \ninstitutions will be conducted.   \n\nTraining  Providers  Strengthened.  With  a  view  to  supporting  the  NPRS  goal  of \n26. \nexpanding  skill  development  to  more  Bangladeshis,  the  Project  will  strengthen  institutional \ncapacity, on a training program basis, of public and private TVET providers to deliver short CBT \ncourses  developed  under  the  Project.  The  Project 11   will  assist  about  60  public  training \ninstitutions,12 15 private training institutions, and 10 NGO-managed training centers. The TVET \ninstitutions  will  be  competitively  selected.  Shortlisting  will  be  based  on  a  set  of  criteria  to  be \napproved  by  the  project  steering  committee  (PSC)  and  ADB  (see  para.  42).  Possible  criteria \ninclude  proximity  to  a  labor  market,  enrolment,  pass  rates,  employment  rates,  facilities,  and \n\n                                                 \n10  The  Project  will  provide  consultancy  services,  learning  and  training  materials  (including  e-learning),  multimedia \nmaterials  and  training  packages,  cost  of  delivering  training,  workshops  and  conferences,  newsletters,  resource \npeople, and baseline and evaluation studies in TVET teacher training. \n\n11  The  Project  allocates  $15.8  million  for  this  purpose.  The  allocated  resources  are  also  called  the  \u201ccompetitive \n\nprogram development fund.\u201d \n\n12 The distribution is expected to be as follows: 24 technical schools and colleges, 14 polytechnics/monotechnics (2 of \nwhich  will  be  polytechnics  for  women),  10  technical  training  centers,  2  training  institutions  from  the  Ministry  of \nTextiles, and 10 training institutions/centers from other ministries. \n\n \n\n\fthe  priority  occupations, \n\nindustry  linkage\u2014features  that  contribute  to  delivering  good  quality  CBT  courses.  The \nshortlisted  TVET  institutions  will  apply  for  funding  by  preparing  program  improvement  plans. \nThe  plans  will  be  evaluated  by  a  TVET  providers\u2019  proposal  evaluation  committee,  comprising \nrepresentatives of the Project, Bureau of Manpower, Employment and Training (BMET), another \ngovernment  agency,  and  state  corporations;  the  services  of  an  expert  committee  may  be \nemployed if necessary. The evaluation criteria may include alignment of the proposed programs \nwith \ntargets, \ninstitutionalization  of  an  industry  advisory  committee,  and  endorsement  of  the  program \nimprovement  plans  by  the  industry  advisory  committee.  Successful  public,  private,  and  NGO \ninstitutions  will  receive  project  resources  to  finance  the  requirements  indicated  in  their \nrespective  program  improvement  plans,  including  workshops/laboratories,  offices,  and  toilets; \ntraining  equipment  and  furniture;  books,  learning  materials,  and  training  supplies;  and  staff \ndevelopment. The Project will provide the successful TVET institutions with additional resources \nto deliver short CBT courses to about 36,000 trainees. Allowances may be provided to trainees \nas  appropriate  (Appendix  6  and  Supplementary  Appendix  A  provide  additional  information  on \nthe flow of funds).  \n\nthe  output  and  outcome \n\nreasonableness  of \n\n27. \nAdditionally,  the  Project  will  assist  the  focus  industries  by  supporting  about  six \npartnerships  between  the  industry  associations  in  the  SWCs  and  existing  public  TVET \ninstitutions. This can include strengthening industry training programs in partnership with TVET \ninstitutions  and  establishing  new  partnerships  as  necessary,  including  management  of \ngovernment  TVET  institutions  by  industry  associations  on  a  pilot  basis.  The  items  eligible  for \nproject  support  will  be  the  same  as  for  the  other  TVET  institutions.  The  PIU  will  facilitate  the \npartnerships  based  on  the  training  needs  identified  by  the  industry  associations  and  suitable \nfacilities of an existing training institution, among other considerations.  \n\n28.  Where  project  resources  are  still  available,  another  set  of  training  institutions  and \npartnerships may be strengthened. This would follow the review of the criteria and procedures; if \nrefined, these would be submitted for PSC and ADB approval.  \n\n29. \nTo support public training institutions with implementation of their program improvement \nplans,  the  Project  will  support  policy  development  to  increase  their  financial  authority  and \nadministrative autonomy. In addition, the Project will provide for the repair and renovations of all \nDTE training institutions that do not qualify for training program strengthening. This will finance \nminor equipment repairs and maintenance, roof repairs, wall repairs, and cleaning and painting. \nLocal  training  and  workshops  will  be  provided  to  senior  administrators  of  government  training \ninstitutions in school management, training needs assessment, and linking with industry.   \n\n30. \nDTE  Capacity  for  Planning,  Research,  and  Social  Marketing  Strengthened.  To \nsupport the identification of occupations needed by the three industries and the informal sector, \nthe  Project  will  support  the  establishment  of  a  research  and  development  cell  in  DTE.  Project \nsupport will include provision of personnel costs, office furniture and equipment, software, staff \ndevelopment,  and  costs  associated  with  printing  and  disseminating  reports  of  DTE  and  the \nresearch  and  development  cell.  The  Project  will  conduct  a  study  to  develop  a  10-year \ndevelopment  plan  with  costs  for  the  TVET  subsector  of  Bangladesh.  This  will  incorporate \npolicies, systems, and procedures adopted, including relevant recommendations of the EC\u2013ILO \nproject. The study will include capacity building of relevant planning and research cell personnel \nthrough on-the-job training. The Project will support contracted baseline, tracer and evaluation \nstudies. Data to be collected will be from teacher training and skills training beneficiaries of the \nProject, and a sample of nonbeneficiaries. Research funds will be available for other studies to \nbe identified and undertaken as necessary by DTE, BMET and BTEB, with approval from ADB.  \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\f  9\n\nA  social  marketing  plan  will  be  prepared  and  implemented  to  disseminate  more  TVET \n31. \ninformation  and  raise  the  profile  of  TVET  among  the  general  population,  particularly  potential \ntrainees and their parents, industry, and employers.13 To gauge the impact of social marketing \nactivities,  a  perception  survey  will  be  conducted  before  the  end  of  project  implementation.  To \nfacilitate  TVET  administration  and  project  implementation,  the  Project  will  provide  for  office \nspace  and  civil  works,  including  the  one-floor  vertical  extension  of  the  DTE  building  to \naccommodate the PIU.  \n\n3.  \n\nRelevant Skills Training Delivered  \n\nThis  component  aims  to  support  the  delivery  of  skills  training  programs  needed  by  the \n\n32. \nlabor market, particularly in the three focus industries and in poor communities.  \n\n33.  Market-Responsive Skills Training Delivered. The Project will support14 the provision \nof  quick-response  and  market-driven  short-term  skills  training  to  about  25,000  trainees, \nparticularly  in  ready-made  garments  and  textiles,  light  engineering,  and  construction;  and  the \ninformal sector. The Project will support the training of unemployed and underemployed school \nleavers,  women,  and  adults,  including  those  from  poor  communities  (about  7,200  trainees),  in \ncommunity training workshops to be established by the Project (see para. 35). The support will \ncover  (i)  fees  or  salaries  of  teachers  and  support  staff  (direct  or  subcontracted);  (ii) \nconsumables and supplies linked to training such as materials, video/audio tapes, and software; \n(iii)  travel  and  accommodation  directly  related  to  training  program  delivery;  (iv)  allowances  of \ntrainees, as appropriate, which will be part of the provider\u2019s proposal; (v) operating costs related \nto  training,  such  as  utilities,  rental  of  equipment,  and  training  venues;  and  (vi)  overhead/profit \n(Appendix  7  and  Supplementary  Appendix  B  provide  more  information  on  the  flow  of  funds.) \nTraining  courses  will  include  CBT,  following  the  skills  standards  and  curricula  developed \nthrough  the  Project,  and  will  not  necessarily  require  class  8  completion  for  admission.  As \nappropriate,  training  in  poor  communities  does  not  have  to  be  CBT  training,  and  can  include \nentrepreneurship and/or link trainees to NGOs with financial assistance activities. \n\n34. \nThe  PIU  will  identify  immediate  training  needs  in  the  three  focus  industries  and  the \ninformal  sector,  and  package  these  for  open  tendering  to  providers,  including  those \nstrengthened by the Project. In cooperation with the PIU, BMET will also identify training needs, \nparticularly  for  the  international  labor  market.  The  project  implementation  committee  (PIC)  will \nprioritize the occupational areas to be supported in this component (see para. 42). Skills training \nwill  be  provided  by  BMET\u2019s  technical  training  centers  (TTCs)  and  other  training  providers \nselected through tendering. BMET will assign its training packages to its TTCs most capable of \ndelivering them, or tender as appropriate. The selection criteria for providers of tendered training \ninclude pass rates in terminal examinations, employment rates of graduates, years of operation, \nenrollment  size,  number  and  qualifications  of  teachers,  and  facilities.  The  tender  evaluation \ncommittee, with the assistance of an expert committee as necessary, will evaluate the providers\u2019 \nproposals  and  make  their  recommendation  to  the  PIC.  The  PIU  will  be  supported  by  the \nservices  of  international  and  national  specialists  in  training  financing  management  design  and \ntraining program design and packaging.   \n\nSkills Training Delivered in Poor Communities. The Project will facilitate the provision \n35. \nof short vocational trade courses in poor communities. The Project will establish a multipurpose \ntraining  workshop  in  40  government  educational  institutions  in  poor  communities.  The \n\n                                                 \n13  This  will  include  advertisements  through  mass  media,  preparation  and  distribution  of  printed  materials,  and \n\nparticipation in community and institutional events. \n\n14  The  Project  has  allocated  $9.2  million  for  this  purpose.  The  allocated  resources  are  also  called  the  \u201cmarket-\n\nresponsive training fund.\u201d \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\ncommunities will be selected based on criteria to be approved by the PSC and ADB and include \npoverty indicators and population size. DTE regional staff will manage the training workshops, \nwhich  will  be  open  to  all  training  providers  for  use  as  venues/platforms  for  short  skills  training \ncourses  in  their  communities.  The  Project  will  engage  NGOs  to  conduct  training  gap \nassessments,  determine  employment  and  business  opportunities  of  residents,  and  identify \nneeded  trades;  and  in  the  process  build  the  capacity  of  DTE  regional  staff  to  work  with  poor \ncommunities. Based on the assessments, the Project will support the introduction and delivery \nof needed vocational trade courses in the workshops through market-responsive skills training \n(see para. 33).   \n\n4.  \n\nProject Management  \n\n36. \nTo support project implementation, the Project will finance office space rental and minor \ncivil works while the DTE building is being constructed, office equipment and furniture, vehicles, \nand  remuneration  of  PIU  staff.  To  strengthen  the  project  management  capacity  of  PIU,  DTE, \nand  MOE  staff,  training  will  be  provided,  particularly  on  procurement,  disbursement,  and \nfinancial  administration.  In  implementing  activities  to  strengthen  programs  of  selected  TVET \ninstitutions and to support delivery of market-responsive skills training, the PIU will be assisted \nby  an  international  training  financing  management  design  specialist  and  international  and \nnational  training  program  design  and  packaging  specialists.  A  national  financial  management \nspecialist  will  strengthen  the  PIU\u2019s  financial  administration  capacity.  To  support  project \nimplementation in BMET, a BMET implementation cell will be established and its staff supported \nby  the  Project.  The  Project  will  also  provide  external  independent  financial  and  performance \nassessments. \n\nC. \n\nSpecial Features \n\n37. \nPublic\u2013Private Sector Partnership. Until now, TVET training providers and employers \nhave conducted training activities independently, except for a few partnerships initiated by some \nNGOs and industry groups. The Project will pilot a partnership structure and processes to bring \npublic authorities, training providers, employers, and NGOs together. The approach is market-\nresponsive rather than supply-driven. Employer representatives will identify occupations where \ntraining gaps exist and specify the required skills standards. The Project will provide resources \nfor  skills  training  development  and  addressing  training  gaps.  Resources  will  be  available  for \nestablishing  or  strengthening  training  partnerships  between  industry  associations  and  public \nTVET institutions.  \n\nFocus on Short CBT Courses. The Project will focus on the development and rollout of \n38. \nshort,  modular  training  programs  based  on  competency  standards  set  by  industry.  The \nGovernment  will  certify  the  training  programs  to  increase  their  recognition  by  employers.  The \nshort courses will diversify the system\u2019s clientele, opening up opportunities for those unable to \ncomplete class 8, including the poor, women, and disadvantaged groups.   \n\nThe project investment cost is estimated at $66.7 million, including taxes and duties of \n\n39. \n$7.8 million (Table 1). Detailed cost estimates are in appendixes 8, 9, and 10. \n\nD. \n\nProject Investment Plan \n\nE. \n\nFinancing Plan \n\nThe Government has requested a loan of $50.0 million in various currencies equivalent \n40. \nto  Special  Drawing  Rights  (SDR)  30,741,000  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources  to  help \nfinance the Project. The loan will have a 32-year term including a grace period of 8 years, with \nan  interest  charge  of  1%  per  annum  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5%  per  annum  thereafter. \n\n\f  11\n\nThe  ADB  loan  will  finance  costs  relating  to  civil  works;  procurement  of  vehicles;  equipment; \nlearning resources; training; consulting services; research and administration; financial charges \nduring implementation; and a portion of project operation, maintenance, and staff salaries; but \nnot taxes and duties.

MOE will be the Executing Agency for the Project. DTE will be the Implementing Agency, \nand have overall responsibility to plan, organize, manage, and monitor project implementation, \nas  well  as  monitor  progress  achieved.  The  PIU  will  be  responsible  for  day-to-day  project \nimplementation and overall coordination among all stakeholders. It will be headed by a full-time \nproject  director  who  will  be  at  the  level  of  joint  secretary.  MOE  will  inform  ADB  prior  to  any \nchange of the project director. A full-time additional project director, to be seconded from senior \nDTE staff, will be the overall deputy to the project director. Appendix 11 presents the indicative \nPIU structure.   \n\nThe PSC15 will be formed within 1 month of loan effectiveness and chaired by the MOE \n\n42. \n                                                 \n15  PSC  membership  will  comprise  a  representative  of  the  Economic  Relations  Division;  the  Chief  (Planning),  MOE; \nrepresentatives  of  the  Implementation  Monitoring  and  Evaluation  Division,  and  of  the  Planning  Commission; \nDirector  General,  DTE;  Director  General,  BMET;  Chairman, BTEB;  representatives  from  the  Expatriates\u2019  Welfare \nand Overseas Employment Ministry, the Labour and Employment Ministry, and the Youth and Sports Ministry; and \nrepresentatives  of  the  Dhaka  Chamber  of  Commerce  and  Industry,  Bangladesh  Garments  Manufacturer's  and \nExporter's  Association,  Bangladesh  Textile  Mills  Association,  Bangladesh  Knitwear  Manufacturers  and  Exporters \nAssociation,  Bangladesh  Association  of  Construction  Industry,  Bangladesh  Engineering  Industries\u2019  Owners \nAssociation, and Mirpur Agricultural Workshop and Training School. \n\n \n\n\f12 \n\n \n\nsecretary.  The  project  director  will  be  the  member-secretary.  Since  the  PSC  is  expected  to \naddress long-term TVET policy issues, its membership will be flexible. Appropriate people and \nspecialists  will  be  invited  as  required.  The  PSC  will  be  responsible  for  detailed  policy \nformulation, provide guidance and advice to the Project, and approve the Project\u2019s annual work \nplan.  It  will  approve  the  selection  criteria  for  (i)  institutions  eligible  for  program  strengthening \nunder  the  Project,  (ii)  market-responsive  training  proposals  eligible  for  project  support,  (iii) \ntraining providers of the market-responsive skills training programs to be tendered, and (iv) the \n40 educational institutions that will receive a multipurpose training workshop. Since it is a large \ncommittee, the PSC will meet quarterly. A PIC (see para. 34), chaired by the director general, \nDTE,  will  be  established  to  oversee  day-to-day  implementation  of  the  Project.  Among  others, \nthe PIC16 will approve the priority occupations for which training programs are to be developed \nand  delivered  under  the  Project.  To  facilitate  project  implementation  and  coordination  across \nministries  and  agencies,  MOE  will  sign  memoranda  of  understanding/cooperation  with  the \nrelevant  stakeholders  as  necessary.  DTE  and  the  PIU  will  ensure  that  the  Project  is  closely \naligned with the EC\u2013ILO project. \n\nBMET  will  implement  project  activities  that  will  benefit  BMET  institutions  according  to \n43. \napplicable  operations  manuals  and  training  plans.  These  include  (i)  strengthening  the  short \nskills training programs of 10 TTCs, (ii) implementing market-responsive skills training in TTCs, \nand  (iii)  providing  in-service  TVET  teacher  training  for  about  400  BMET  TVET  teachers \naccording to the TVET teacher training plan. As appropriate, the PIU can procure equipment for \nBMET, particularly if internationally procured and/or to take advantage of volume discounts. All \nBMET project activities will be facilitated by the BMET implementation cell; it will be headed by a \ndeputy  project  director  reporting  to  the  project  director  and  the  additional  project  director,  and \nwill have support staff.  \n\n44. \nCivil  works  activities  of  government  institutions  will  be  administered  by  the  appropriate \ngovernment civil works agency (Engineering Education Department for MOE and Public Works \nDepartment for BMET); where implementation delays are experienced, alternate arrangements \nmay be considered in consultation with ADB.     \n\nThe  Project  will  be  implemented  over  5  years,  from  June  2008  to  May  2013.  The \n\n45. \nindicative implementation schedule is in Appendix 12. \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Period \n\n3. \n\nProcurement \n\n46. \nGoods, Services, and Civil Works. ADB-financed goods, services, and civil works will \nbe procured in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to \ntime). The indicative procurement plan for the Project is in Appendix 13. Goods, services, and \ncivil  works  to  be  acquired  for  TVET  institutions  will  be  packaged  as  appropriate.  Each  works \ncontract estimated to cost more than the equivalent of $1 million will be awarded on the basis of \ninternational  competitive  bidding,  and  works  contracts  estimated  to  cost  the  equivalent  of  \n$1 million or less will be awarded on the basis of national competitive bidding (NCB) procedures \nacceptable  to  ADB.  Each  contract  for  goods,  and  equipment  and/or  materials  greater  than  \n$1  million  will  be  awarded  on  the  basis  of  international  competitive  bidding  procedures,  and \nthose  for  $1  million  or  less  will  follow  NCB  procedures  acceptable  to  ADB.  NCB  procedures \napplicable  to  the  Project  are  specified  in  the  Government\u2019s  Public  Procurement  Act  2006. \nBefore  commencement  of  NCB  procurement,  ADB  and  the  Government  will  review  the \n\n                                                 \n16  PIC membership will comprise representatives from the Planning Commission, the Implementation Monitoring and \n\nEvaluation Division, MOE, BTEB\u2019s CDC, the NGO SWC, industry SWCs; and director, training, BMET. \n\n\fGovernment\u2019s  procurement  procedures  to  ensure  consistency  with  ADB  requirements.  Any \nnecessary  modifications  or  clarifications  to  Government  procedures  will  be  documented  in  the \nprocurement  plan.  NCB  packages  valued  at  more  than  $100,000  each  will  be  subject  to  prior \nreview  by  ADB.  Draft  documents  for  NCB  of  packages  valued  at  between  $50,000  and \n$100,000 will be reviewed by ADB before the first package is tendered. The PIU will ensure that \nall  procurement  complies  with  the  applicable  procedures.  Goods,  services,  and  civil  works  of \nbeneficiary TVET institutions will be packaged as appropriate. \n\nVarious  training  providers  will  provide  the  short-term  skills  training.  Skills  training  to  be \n47. \nconducted  as  part  of  the  program-strengthening  assistance  to  TVET  institutions  will  be \nconducted  by  the  beneficiary  institutions.  Market-responsive  skills  training  will  be  delivered \nthrough  open  tender  and  through  BMET\u2019s  TTCs.  Training  packages  to  be  tendered  will  be \ncontracted as services; technical evaluation criteria will comprise 80% of the total score.  \n\n48. \nStaff  Development  and  Training.  The  Project  will  provide  international  and  local \ntraining  to  qualified  recipients  (Appendix  14),  including  attendance  in  appropriate  international \nconferences  and  workshops.  Selection  of  candidates  will  follow  the  Government\u2019s  policy  and \nimplementing guidelines for international and local training. ADB concurrence of candidates for \ninternational  staff  development  will  be  obtained  prior  to  final  selection  by  the  competent \nauthority. ADB will be provided with a list of (i) nominated candidates, (ii) their qualifications, (iii) \njustification  and  relevance  of  training,  and  (iv)  detailed  cost  of  proposed  training.  Only \ncandidates  whose  work  is  directly  related  to  the  objectives  of  the  regional  and  international \ntraining and study tours will be considered. Training recipients must sign a bonding arrangement \nrequiring  them  to  remain  in  their  institutions  for  a  minimum  period,  in  accordance  with \nGovernment procedures. VTTI and TTTC will provide in-service TVET teacher training activities. \nAs required, other appropriate teacher training institutions and providers of hands-on technology \ntraining  and  pedagogy  will  be  contracted  to  provide  TVET  teacher  training  according  to  the \nTVET  teacher  training  plan.  They  will  use  training  materials  developed  through  the  Project, \namong others.  \n\n4. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n49. \nThe selection and engagement of consultants to be financed under the Project will be in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to \ntime) and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for the engagement of national consultants. \nThe consultants\u2019 services will comprise about 97 person-months from international consultants \nand  260  person-months \nfrom  national  consultants  (Appendix  13,  Table  A13.4,  and \nSupplementary  Appendix  C).  A  team  of  consultants  will  provide  services  in  a  range  of \nspecializations,  with  estimated  international  inputs  of  about  85  person-months  and  national \ninputs of about 224 person-months. The team will be engaged through a firm using the quality- \nand  cost-based  selection  method;  the  quality-cost  ratio  will  be  80:20.  A  full  technical  proposal \nwill  be  used  for  recruitment.  The  consulting  team,  led  by  the  team  leader,  will  arrange  and \nimplement the Project\u2019s international staff training program, for which a separate management \nfee  will  be  provided.  Additional  national  consultants  will  be  separately  engaged  to  provide \nservices  for  external  independent  performance  and  financial  assessments,  research  studies, \nand monitoring and evaluation activities. \n\n50. \nTaking  into  account  the  services  required  and  consultants  to  be  recruited,  and  the \nnecessity to reduce project implementation start-up delays, the Government has requested that \nADB,  on  behalf  of  the  Government,  undertake  the  shortlisting,  evaluation,  and  ranking  of  the \nlead firms or organizations and their proposals. Contract negotiations, approval and signing of \ncontracts will remain the Government\u2019s responsibility, with ADB assistance as may be required. \n\n  13\n\n \n\n\fAdvance  Contracting.  As  the  Project  needs  to  operate  immediately  after  loan \n51. \neffectiveness,  MOE  has  requested  advance  action  for  procurement  of  civil  works,  goods,  and \nmaterials  and/or  equipment  to  expedite  project  implementation,  as  well  as  for  shortlisting \nconsulting  firms.  Advance  action  will  apply  only  until  the  evaluation  of  bids;  contracts  will  be \nawarded and agreements signed only after loan effectiveness. ADB\u2019s concurrence on advance \nactions does not commit ADB to finance the Project.  \n\n5. \n\nAnticorruption Policy \n\nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \n52. \nwith the  Government.  Consistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability, and \ntransparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged \ncorrupt,  fraudulent,  collusive,  or  coercive  practices  relating  to  the  Project.  To  support  these \nefforts,  relevant  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  are  included  in  the  loan  regulations \nand  the  bidding  documents  for  the  Project.  In  particular,  all  contracts  financed  by  ADB  in \nconnection  with  the  Project  shall  include  provisions  specifying  the  right  of  ADB  to  audit  and \nexamine  the  records  and  accounts  of  the  Executing  Agency  and  all  contractors,  suppliers, \nconsultants, and other service providers as they relate to the Project.  \n\n53. \nGood  governance  and  anticorruption  measures  for  the  Project  are  in  Appendix  15. \nDuring implementation, ADB will monitor project activities frequently and regularly, including the \nselection of training and educational institutions to be assisted by the Project and the selection \nof training providers. The PIU will have a project website that will provide procurement notices, \nprocurement status, progress updates of training institutions receiving assistance, and progress \nof funded training programs. The PIU will have a monitoring and evaluation unit that will monitor \ncivil works and skills training activities. Consultants in financial management, procurement, and \ntraining  financing  management  design  will  provide  strengthening  for  transparency  and \ngovernance. External independent assessments will be conducted for finance and performance.   \n\n6. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n54.  MOE  will  be  responsible  for  preparing  disbursement  projections,  and  requesting \nbudgetary  allocations  for  counterpart  funds.  To  ensure  the  timely  release  of  loan  funds,  an \nimprest account will be established in Bangladesh Bank. The initial deposit will be equivalent to \nno  more  than  6  months  of  projected  disbursements,  or  10%  of  the  loan  amount,  whichever  is \nless.  The  imprest  account  will  be  established,  managed,  and  liquidated  in  accordance  with \nADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook, and detailed arrangements agreed to by the Government \nand ADB. ADB\u2019s statement of expenditure (SOE) procedures may be used to reimburse eligible \nexpenditures,  as  well  as  to  liquidate  advances  made  into  the  imprest  account,  in  accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s loan disbursement guidelines. Any payment to be reimbursed or liquidated under the \nSOE  procedures  will  not  exceed  the  equivalent  of  $50,000.  MOE  will  coordinate  the  timely \nrelease of funds. Auditors acceptable to ADB will audit the use of the imprest account and SOE \nprocedures.  A  separate  audit  opinion  will  be  included  in  the  annual  audit  report.  The  PIU  will \nprovide  an  advance  to  a  separate  BMET  account  for  an  amount  equal  to  6  months  of  their \nplanned  work  based  on  a  6-month  work  plan.  The  BMET  account  will  be  subject  to  the  same \naudit and financial management requirements as the PIU account.  \n\n7. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n55. \nThe Government, acting through MOE, will maintain records and accounts adequate to \nidentify  goods  and  services  financed  from  the  loan  proceeds.  MOE  will  maintain  separate \nrecords  and  accounts  for  the  Project,  and  ensure  that  accounts  and  financial  statements  are \naudited annually by independent external auditors acceptable to ADB. The auditor\u2019s report and \n\n14 \n\n \n\n\fcopies of the certified accounts and related financial statements, including the auditor\u2019s opinion \non  the  use  of  loan  proceeds,  procurement,  compliance  with  loan  covenants,  and  use  of  the \nimprest account and the BMET account under ADB\u2019s SOE procedures, will be submitted to ADB \nin English not later than 6 months after the end of the Government\u2019s fiscal year. \n\n56. \nThe PIU will compile and consolidate monthly reports, and prepare a quarterly progress \nreport for submission to ADB within 20 days after each quarter. The report will include (i) actual \nachievements  against  targets;  (ii)  major  problems  and  issues  encountered  in  the  course  of \nimplementation, and actions taken or proposed to resolve them; (iii) status of compliance with \nloan covenants; and (iv) planned activities for the succeeding quarter including contract awards \nand  disbursement  projection.  Within  3  months  after  the  end  of  implementation,  MOE  will \nprepare  and  submit  to  ADB  a  project  completion  report  on  execution  of  the  Project,  including \ncosts, compliance with loan covenants, key outputs, outcomes and impacts, and lessons.  \n\n8. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n57. \nTo  ensure  efficient  project  implementation,  the  Government  will  prepare  and  provide \nADB with the operational plan for the Project for the next fiscal year, at least 30 days before the \nstart  of  the  next  fiscal  year.  The  operational  plan  will  include  (i)  project  activities  with  cost \nestimates proposed for each component and/or subcomponent with performance targets; (ii) a \nplan for complying with outstanding loan covenants; (iii) a breakdown of financial requirements, \nincluding loan proceeds withdrawal and counterpart funds from the Government; and (iv) details \non how project activities are to be integrated into ongoing programs.  \n\n58. \nDTE  and  the  PIU  will  establish  a  comprehensive  project  performance  monitoring  and \nevaluation  system  acceptable  to  ADB.  The  Monitoring  and  Evaluation  Unit  of  the  PIU  will  be \nprimarily responsible for monitoring input, activity, milestone, and output performance indicators \nagainst  performance  targets;  and  compliance  with  guidelines,  procedures,  contract  provisions, \nand  budgets  to  ensure  accountability  and  transparency.  Data  to  be  collected  about  project \nbeneficiaries  will  include  gender,  ethnicity,  and  socioeconomic  or  poverty  indicators.  PIU \nmanagement and staff and consultants will conduct on-site monitoring visits to observe activities \nand get direct feedback from participants, providers, and other interested stakeholders. External \nindependent  financial  and  performance  assessments  of  project  implementation  will  also  be \nundertaken.  Studies  will  be  conducted  during  project  implementation:  baseline  study,  tracer \nstudies,  and  end-of-project  evaluation  study.  Conducted  during  the  first  6  months  of  project \ncommencement, the baseline study will establish baseline data on the status of assisted public \nand private TVET institutions. The tracer and evaluation studies will assess the impacts of the \nintervention on the capacity of assisted institutions, TVET teachers, and skills training recipients. \nData  from  control  groups  will  be  collected.  Study  contracts  will  include  provisions  for \nstrengthening  DTE\u2019s  research  and  development  cell  through  participation  and  mentoring  in \nstudy activities. The midterm review of the Project will be supported by a midterm assessment \nstudy.  \n\n9. \n\nProject Review \n\nThe Government and ADB, and any cofinanciers that may provide joint financing of the \n59. \nProject  at  a  later  date,  will  review  the  Project\u2019s  progress  jointly  at  least  twice  a  year.  Besides \nthese  regular  reviews,  the  Government  and  ADB  will  undertake  a  joint  midterm  review  during \nthe  Project\u2019s  third  year.  Among  other  things,  they  will  (i)  review  the  project  scope,  design, \nimplementation  arrangements,  institutional  development,  and  capacity-building  processes;  (ii) \nreview  changes  in  Government  policies  and  institutional  framework  since  appraisal,  and \nevaluate  their  impact  on  project  implementation  and  sustainability;  (iii)  assess  project \nimplementation  against  appropriate  projections  and  performance  indicators;  (iv)  review \n\n  15\n\n \n\n\f16 \n\n \n\ncompliance  with  loan  covenants;  (v)  assess  compliance  with  the  gender  action  plan,  the \nindigenous  peoples  development  framework,  and  the  good  governance  and  anticorruption \nmeasures; (vi) identify critical issues, problems, and constraints; and (vii) recommend changes \nin  project  design  or  implementation,  as  needed.  The  review  will  give  specific  attention  to  (i) \nprogress of cooperation between the SWCs, DTE, BMET and BTEB; (ii) identification of needed \nskills training; and (iii) implementation of activities to provide program strengthening in selected \nTVET institutions and activities to provide market-responsive skills training, including amount of \nassistance, number  of  institutions  assisted,  and  disbursement  rates  for program  strengthening \nand provision of market-responsive skills training. The number of industries assisted under the \nProject  will  also  be  reviewed.  The  PIU  will  submit  a  comprehensive  report  on  each  of  these \nissues to ADB at least 1 month before the review. In addition, after selection of the first batch of \nTVET  institutions  for  program  strengthening  and  selection  and  tendering  of  the  market-\nresponsive skills training programs, the selection criteria, procedures, processes, and funds flow \nwill  be  reviewed  with  a  view  to  refining  them  and  facilitating  the  application  and  evaluation \nprocess in a transparent manner. Any changes in the criteria and procedures will be submitted \nfor PSC and ADB approval.  \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\nA. \n\nBenefits and Impacts \n\n60. \nInstitutional  and  Sectoral.  The  Project  will  initiate  reform-oriented  activities  in  TVET \nsystem operation with the goal of making it more demand-driven, flexible, and oriented toward \nincreasingly  serving  the  poor  and  disadvantaged.  The  pilot  model  on  public\u2013private  sector \ncollaboration  will  establish  a  linkage  between  the  TVET  authorities  and  training  providers  and \nthe  formal  and  informal  labor  markets  to  minimize  the  mismatch  between  supply  and  demand \nfor labor. The development and use of industry-approved or -recognized competency standards \nwill introduce a new approach to the TVET system that gives more value to actual competencies \nacquired than to traditional qualifications. The revitalization of the two key TVET teacher training \ninstitutions  will  support  an  expanded  teacher  training  system  that  will  also  serve  private  and \nnongovernment  training  providers.  In-service  training  of  TVET  teachers  addresses  the \nimmediate  need  of  TVET  providers  to  provide  untrained  teachers  with  both  pedagogical  and \ntechnological skills, which will contribute to improving the quality of skills training delivery.   \n\n61. \nSocial. The development of short modular CBT courses will provide greater flexibility in \nterms of duration and required students\u2019 academic qualifications. Offering training programs not \nnecessarily requiring class 8 for enrolment will expand access to the TVET system to those who \ndid not complete this required grade, many of whom are poor. Upgrading the facilities of TVET \ninstitutions  will  improve  the  capacity  for  delivering  short,  relevant  training  programs.  Training \nworkshops in selected poor communities will make training more accessible to the poor. Thus, \nthe Project will open TVET institutions to a larger number of trainees in short CBT courses, most \nof whom would have been denied access because of the class 8 barrier to entry. As the training \nprograms  will  be  demand-driven  and  based  on  industry-set  or  -recognized  standards, \nopportunities for employment and self-employment of trainees will improve.    \n\nEconomic.  Economic  benefits  of  the  Project  are  derived  mainly  from  (i)  increased \n62. \naccess to skills training as a result of developing short, modular CBT courses; training delivery \nsupport; and program strengthening of selected TVET institutions; and (ii) improved relevance \nand  quality  of  skills  training  through  the  partnership  with  employers,  industry,  and  NGOs;  and \nthe related revision of curricula and provision of in-service teacher training. The Project will have \nabout 68,200 trainees over the five  years of implementation. After completion of their training, \nthe  graduates  are  expected  to  seek  local  or  international  employment  or  be  self-employed. \nThose who will be employed locally will contribute to increased domestic production because of \n\n\ftheir  skills  training  (increased  human  capital)  that  will  be  reflected  in  increased  earnings. \nGraduates  who  will  be  employed  internationally  will  bring  increased  foreign  currency \nremittances  into  the  country.  With  the  combined  efforts  to  increase  access  to  short-term  skills \ntraining and improve their relevance and quality,  the proportion of trainees employed from the \nProject-supported  training  programs  is  expected  to  improve  to  75%  in  2015.  Teacher  training, \nimprovements  in  the  training  curricula,  and  improved  training  facilities  are  also  expected  to \nbenefit students enrolled in the SSC (Voc) and HSC (Voc) programs. Although they are not the \ntarget  beneficiaries  of  the  Project,  improving  the  quality  of  teaching  and  practical  training  in \nvocational  subjects  is  expected  to  improve  examination  pass  rates  and  employment  rates. \nUnder these projections, the economic internal rate of return is estimated at 13.9% in the base-\ncase scenario (Appendix 16). \n\nB. \n\nRisks and Assumptions \n\n63. \nThe partnership model assumes the continued commitment and cooperation of the three \npartner-industry associations and NGOs in the SWC. Thus, the Project will sign memoranda of \nunderstanding and provide strengthening activities to SWC members. The three focus industries \nand NGOs are also eligible for training partnership assistance. Their training requirements will \nbe  supported  through  the  provision  of  market-responsive  skills  training.  In  addition,  the \nconcurrent  policy  development  activities  of  EC\u2013ILO  will  reinforce  linkages  with  industry  and \ncoordination  of  TVET-related  government  agencies.  The  Project\u2019s  proposed  capacity \ndevelopment in external competency assessment for the recognition of prior learning assumes \nthat the EC\u2013ILO project activity to develop the related policy and system will be at an advanced \nstage  by  the  end  of  the  Project\u2019s  second  year  of  implementation.  The  Project  will  closely \ncoordinate with the EC\u2013ILO project and, if any delay is experienced in that project, the services \nof  the  Project\u2019s  specialists  in  TVET  policy  and  competency  standards  and  CBT  curriculum, \nmaterials  and  assessment  tools  development  can  help  prepare  the  draft  of  the  relevant  policy \nand its supporting system to facilitate the process.  \n\nThe  Project  aims  to  provide  in-service  training  to  about  4,000  untrained  teachers  from \n64. \npublic  and  private  TVET  institutions.  However,  substitute  teachers  may  not  be  available  while \nthe untrained teachers are on training. This will be addressed by  making the training program \nmodular, short, and continuous; and scheduling teacher training when student training programs \nare not in session. The Project\u2019s loan assurances also provide for BTEB certification of the in-\nservice  teacher  training.  EC\u2013ILO  activities  in  TVET  teacher  qualifications  and  teacher \nstrengthening will complement this activity.  \n\nThe  limited  scope  of  activities  in  the  two  key  TVET  teacher  training  institutions \n65. \ncontributed to its underutilization. The new approach to include a multiparty advisory board, in-\nservice  outreach  training,  and  training  for  staff  from  the  private  and  NGO  sectors  and  other \nministries will help increase utilization of TVET facilities. Management training for administrators \nwill  facilitate  addressing  the  training  needs  of  non-MOE  staff.  Complementary  inputs  from  the \nEC\u2013ILO  project  will  support  improvements  in  quality  and  relevance  that  should  maintain  the \ndemand for the preservice and in-service TVET teacher training programs.   \n\nThe  pace  of  providing  market-responsive  skills  training,  which  involves  awarding  and \n66. \nadministering  many  training  contracts,  will  depend  on  the  PIU\u2019s  implementation  capacity.  To \nminimize the risk of delays, the Project will provide (i) adequate highly qualified staff, including \nfor contract administration, in the PIU; and (ii) support for the evaluation committees. The PIU \nwill also be supported by international and national specialists in training financing management \ndesign, training program design and packaging, and financial management. \n\n  17\n\n \n\n\fSafeguard  Measures.  The  summary  poverty  reduction  and  social  strategy  and  the \n67. \ngender  action  plan  are  in  appendixes  17  and  18.  The  Project\u2019s  environmental  aspects  were \nreviewed;  no  adverse  impacts  are  anticipated.  The  amount  of  waste  generated  under  the \nProject is expected to be small. Nevertheless, environmental considerations will be incorporated \ninto  the  project  activities  to  avoid  any  minor  environmental  impacts  during  refurbishment  of \ntraining  institutions  and  in  the  disposal  of  training  waste  materials.  Waste  management  plans \nwill  be  formulated  to  protect  human  health  and  the  environment;  and  to  ensure  the  safe \ncollection,  transport,  treatment,  storage,  and  disposal  of  waste.  The  plans  will  highlight \nsegregation  at  source,  recovery  and  use  of  recovered  materials,  and  safe  disposal  in \nappropriately designated landfill sites. The Project will have no negative impacts on indigenous \npeople,  but  will  impact  positively  on  all  qualified  trainee-beneficiaries,  including  indigenous \npeople (Appendix 19). To ensure that training will not hinder the attendance of any member of \nan indigenous group, training venues will be in publicly accessible venues. With no planned land \nacquisition, the Project is unlikely to trigger ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy (1995). \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n\nA. \n\nSpecific Assurances  \n\nIn addition to the standard assurances, the Government has given the following specific \n\n68. \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n\n69.  MOE  will  ensure  that  all  skills  and  training  standards,  curricula,  and  training  programs \ndeveloped  through  the  Project  will  receive  BTEB  certification.  All  recipients  of  skills  training \nunder  the  Project  and  all  TVET  teachers  who  receive  in-service  teacher  training  through  the \nProject will be granted BTEB certification after complying with necessary assessment standards \nand applicable rules and regulations of BTEB.  \n\n70.  Within  1  year  of  loan  effectiveness,  BTEB  will  have  issued  an  order  making  the \nregistration and affiliation of training institutions subject to performance-based assessments and \nfull  compliance  with  registration  requirements,  including  employing  trained  TVET  teachers  as \nstaff. \n\n71.  MOE will ensure that, prior to Project completion, every teacher teaching in SSC (Voc) \nprograms  and  receiving  salary  subvention  will  have  participated  in  pedagogical  and  technical \ntraining.  \n\n72.  Within six months of loan effectiveness, MOE will submit to the Ministry of Establishment \na  proposal  for  transferring  the  existing  teaching  and  training  posts  created  in  those  public \ntraining  institutions  assisted  under  the  Project  from  the  development  budget  to  the  revenue \nbudget.  \n\nAt  least  12  months  before  Project  completion,  MOE  will  submit  to  the  Ministry  of \n73. \nEstablishment a proposal for transferring posts of the DTE research and development cell and \nof  the  regional  offices  from  the  development  budget  to  the  revenue  budget.  Equally  qualified \nwomen will be given preference.  \n\n74. \nBy 30 June 2009, MOE will delegate the authority to recruit part-time TVET teachers for \npublic training institutions, including for short-term skills training, to regional DTE offices. Upon \ncompletion  of  the  EC\u2013ILO  study  on  increased  autonomy  of  training  institutions,  MOE  will \ndelegate  financial  authority  to  all  public  training  institutions,  including  for  hiring  part-time \ninstructors and instructors for short-term training courses.  \n\n18 \n\n \n\n\fThe Government will ensure that sufficient resources for training supplies and materials; \n75. \nand  repair,  operation,  and  maintenance  of  facilities  and  equipment  are  made  available  to \nproject-supported  public  training  institutions  throughout  and  after  the  project  implementation \nperiod.  \n\nThroughout the project implementation period, the Government will ensure that sufficient \n\n76. \nbudget in its recurrent budget to DTE and BMET.   \n\n77.  Within  2  months  of  loan  effectiveness,  MOE  will  issue  an  order  to  VTTI  and  TTTC  to \nensure  that  they  will  serve  the  teacher  training  needs  of  the  government,  private,  and \nnongovernment sectors.  \n \n78.  MOE  will  ensure  that  training  workshops  provided  by  the  Project  to  40  educational \ninstitutions are made available for use as training venues to any training provider.  \n\n79.  Within 3 months of fielding the financing management design consultant, DTE will have \ncompleted  the  establishment  of  a  project  performance  monitoring  system  for  the  Project, \ncollected  baseline  data on  public  and  private  TVET  institutions,  including  on  gender,  ethnicity, \nand socio-economic and poverty indicators.  \n\n80. \nDTE  will  ensure  that  all  project  activities  will  be  implemented  in  accordance  with  the \nselection  criteria  agreed  upon  between  ADB  and  MOE.  The  criteria  and  procedures  to  select \nTVET  institutions  whose  training  programs  will  be  strengthened  under  the  Project,  select  \ntraining  providers  of  market-responsive  skills  training  under  the  Project,  and  establish  training \nworkshops  in  poor  communities  will  be  approved  by  the  PSC  within  3  months  of  loan \neffectiveness. \n\n81.  MOE will inform ADB prior to any change of the project director. \n\nTo ensure efficient project implementation, DTE  will prepare and provide ADB  with  the \n82. \nnext  fiscal  year\u2019s  operations  plan  for  the  Project  at  least  30  days  before  the  start  of  the  next \nfiscal year. \n\n83. \nDTE  will  obtain  ADB\u2019s  concurrence  of  candidates  for  overseas  training  prior  to  final \nselection  by  the  competent  authority.  For  such  purpose,  DTE  will  submit  to  ADB  detailed \ninformation about the candidates\u2019 qualifications, their experience, as well as the relevance and \ndetailed  costs  of  the  proposed  training.  DTE  will  make  all  efforts  to  retain  staff  that  has \nparticipated  in  international  training  in  their  respective  institutions,  including  through  bonding \narrangements in line with the Government\u2019s policy and guidelines for international training. \n\n84.  Within  3  months  of  loan  effectiveness,  the  PIU  will  prepare,  and  DTE  and  MOE  will \napprove,  a  detailed  action  plan,  with  budget  allocation  for  implementing  the  good  governance \nmeasures  set  out  in  Appendix  15  The  progress  of  implementation  will  be  included  in  the \nquarterly reports for the Project and will be made available on the website for the Project. \n\n85. \nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  the  Project  is  implemented  in  accordance  with  the \ngender  action  plan  (Appendix  18)  and  the  indigenous  peoples'  development  framework \n(Supplementary Appendix F). \n\n86. \nThe  Borrower  will  ensure  that  all  civil  works  to  be  carried  out  under  the  Project  will  be \nwithin existing premises and will not entail any land acquisition, resettlement, or land donation \nas  defined  in  ADB's  Policy  on  Involuntary  Resettlement  (1995).  In  the  event  of  unforeseen \nresettlement,  the  Government  will  promptly  inform  ADB  thereof  and  prepare  the  necessary \nresettlement plan in accordance with ADB's  Policy on Involuntary Resettlement. In such case, \n\n  19\n\n \n\n\fthe Government will ensure that no civil works contract will be awarded until ADB has reviewed \nthe resettlement plan.  \n\n87. \nThe Government will ensure that civil works contractors comply with all applicable labor \nlaws,  do  not  employ  child  labor  for  construction  and  maintenance  activities,  and  do  not \ndifferentiate wages between men and women for work of equal value. \n\n88. \nThe  Government  will  ensure  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy  (2002),  and \nexisting  environmental  laws  and  regulations  of  Bangladesh.

SUBSECTOR ANALYSIS \n\n1. \nThe contribution of the technical and vocational education and training (TVET) system to \nthe  supply  of  labor  relative  to  total  demand  is  minimal.  However,  the  Government  and  the \ndevelopment community recognize the potential of TVET in providing employable skills to those \nwho did not and would not pass through the school system; leave the school system early; and \nneed higher skills even after completing the certificate, diploma, or degree courses. However, to \nachieve the goals of the national poverty reduction strategy, many aspects of TVET need to be \naddressed: relevance, quality, and access, in particular. \n\nA.  \n\nThe Technical and Vocational Education Training System \n\n2. \nThe TVET system in Bangladesh may be classified into four groups: (i) public, (ii) private \n(commercial), (iii) nongovernment organization (NGO), and, (iv) industry (managed by industry \nassociations  and  industry-provided  on-the-job  training).  Each  of  these  groups  offers  a  wide \nvariety  of  formal  and  nonformal  training  programs  for  various  types  of  clientele  using  different \ntypes of training delivery. As of school year 2004-05, formal TVET was mostly offered by about \n2,728 institutions: 180 or 7% public and 2,548 or 93% private. Of the 17,185 teachers delivering \nTVET courses, 2,939 or 17% were in public institutions and 14,246 were in private institutions. \nOf  the  241,336  total  enrolment,  20%  was  in  public  and  80%  in  private  institutions.  Between \nschool years 2001/02 and 2004/05, enrolment rose by about 80%.  \n\n3. \nDifferent  ministries  manage  the  public  institutions.  The  Directorate  for  Technical \nEducation of the Ministry of Education (MOE) manages polytechnic and monotechnic institutes \nand  technical  schools  and  colleges;  the  Ministry  of  Labor  manages  technical  training  centers; \nthe  Ministry  of  Textile  manages  textile  vocational  centers;  and  the  Ministry  of  Agriculture \nmanages  agricultural  training  institutes.  The  private  institutions  are  mostly  general  secondary \nschools  offering  TVET  courses  alongside  the  general  secondary  curriculum.  While  the  private \nTVET institutions are numerous, they are mostly small with an average of about 6 teachers and \n75  students  per  institution,  compared  with  about  16  teachers  and  272  students  of  the  public \nsector,  although  their  student\u2013teacher  ratios  are  not  too  different.  In  addition,  other  ministries \nand agencies provide nonformal TVET courses.1\n\n4. \nFormal TVET in Bangladesh consists of three program offerings\u2014basic, certificate, and \ndiploma\u2014with  class  (or  grade)  8  completion  a  minimum  entry  qualification.  Basic  trade  (basic \nskill  standard  certificate  or  national  skills  standard-basic)  is  a  360-hour  skills  training  course \nfocusing mainly on practical skills with some theory requiring class 8 education. This is offered \nmainly at technical training centers and technical schools and colleges. The secondary school \ncertificate (vocational) (SSC [Voc]) is a 2-year certificate course after class 8, and is attractive to \nstudents  because  of  its  equivalency  to  (i)  the  SSC  of  the  general  education  stream,  which \nprovides  entry  to  higher  education;  and  (ii)    national  skills  standard  II,  which  should  provide \nentry into the world of work. National skills standard III is awarded after class 9 completion. SSC \n\n                                                 \n1   These  include  the  Bangladesh  Chemical  Industries  Corporation,  Bangladesh  Handloom  Board,  Bangladesh \nIndustrial  Technical  Assistance  Center,  Bangladesh  Jute  Mills  Corporation,  Bangladesh  Power  Development \nBoard, Bangladesh Railways, Bangladesh Small and Cottage Industries Corporation, Ministry of Civil Aviation and \nTourism,  Ministry  of  Defense,  Ministry  of  Energy  and  Natural  Resources,  Ministry  of  Environment  and  Forest, \nMinistry  of  Health,  Ministry  of  Local  Government  and  Rural  Development,  Ministry  of  Shipping,  Ministry  of  Social \nWelfare, Ministry of Women\u2019s Affairs, and the Ministry of Youth and Sports. \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\f26 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n \n\n(Voc)  graduates  may  proceed  to  higher  secondary  certificate  (vocational)  (HSC  [Voc])  for \nanother 2 years after class 10. They also receive two qualifications: entry to polytechnics where \na  15%  quota  is  reserved  for  them,  and  national  skills  standard  I  if  they  decide  to  seek  work. \nThese courses are offered at the technical schools and colleges, technical training centers, and \nprivate  general  schools.  The  higher  secondary  certificate  (business  management)  is  a  2-year \ncertificate course after class 10, which is offered only in private general schools and colleges. \nSalary subvention of 90% of teacher salaries is provided to nongovernment schools offering the \nSSC (Voc) and HSC (Voc) programs and registered with the Bangladesh Technical Education \nBoard (BTEB). Public and private polytechnic institutions offer four-year postsecondary diploma \ncourses in engineering. In 2004, the number of trades offered in the courses increased from 110 \nto 279, significantly increasing available options to students.  \n\nNGOs as TVET Providers. NGOs provide a variety of nonformal skills training directed \n5. \nto  specific  target  groups  such  as  the  poor,  women,  and  the  marginalized;  however,  BTEB \ncurrently  does  not  accredit  this  training.  The  majority  of  NGOs  are  small  and  lack  physical \nfacilities.  Being  immersed  in  the  communities  that  they  serve,  they  have  the  capability  to \nmobilize  large  numbers  of  people  anytime,  and  with  some  help  can  effectively  deliver  quality \ntraining. Some NGOs have been highly effective in delivering skills training and have networks \nthat extend to hard-to-reach areas. They provide an integrated approach to human development \nthat  includes  not  only  skills  supported  with  microcredit,  but  also  teach  appropriate  work \nattitudes. NGOs often mentioned in this context are the Under-Privileged Children\u2019s Education \nProgram, Mirpur Agricultural Workshop and Training School, Caritas Mobile Skills Training, St. \nJoseph\u2019s School, and Bangladesh Rural Advancement Committee (BRAC).  \n\nTVET  in  Industry.  A  study 2   undertaken  during  project  preparation  found  that  the \n6. \nmajority  of  workers  mainly  acquire  their  skills  on-the-job.  Those  who  acquired  them  formally \nmainly attended technical institutes. The majority (72%) of the firms surveyed indicated that they \nhad  no  training  facilities,  and  a  small  subgroup  (12%)  sent  their  workers  to  external  training \norganizations for upgrading.   \n\n7. \nSome  employer  associations  have  training  establishments.  The  Bangladesh  Garments \nManufacturers Export Association established the Institute of Fashion and Technology as a fully \nself-financed  training  institute.  Employers  established  the  Chittagong  Skills  Development \nCenter,  which  is  a  model  of  industry\u2013government  cooperation.  Development  agencies  and \nindustry have partnered with MOE to upgrade industry-specific institutes for textiles, glass and \nceramics,  and  leather.  In  addition,  industry-specific  training  is  available  for  railway,  air,  and \nmarine  operations.  The  Dhaka  Chamber  of  Commerce  and  Industry  received  development \nagency assistance to establish logistics training.  \n\n8. \nSome labor brokers have their own training programs mainly to supply workers for major \nconstruction projects, e.g., pipelines and bridges, and for international employment. Some of the \nnumbers  are  significant  and  aim  to  fulfill  international  standards,  e.g.,  a  contract  to  train  and \nsupply 20,000 construction workers in 2007 for employment in Singapore. \n\n                                                 \n2 The survey was commissioned to analyze the job-market situation, trade and skills requirements in industries, and \ngrowth of employment opportunities in six divisions in Bangladesh. The sample involved 223 firms in 24 industries \npurposively distributed by division and by type of industry. About 50% of the sample firms were located in Dhaka, \n23%  in  Chittagong,  and  the  rest  were  in  the  other  four  divisions.  Forty  percent  of  the  firms  had  more  than  200 \nemployees, 21% between 100 and 200, 36% between 15 and 100, and 3% less than 15. Trained field interviewers \nused a survey questionnaire to conduct face-to-face interviews with concerned managers of the sample firms. \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 2 \n\n27 \n\nB.  \n\nTVET Issues  \n\n9. \nTraining Quality. The quality of education and training is generally reflected in students\u2019 \npass rates in BTEB\u2019s terminal external examination. During 2000\u20132004, the average pass rate \nfor SSC (Voc) was about 45% for both male and female students or, conversely, 55% of those \nwho finish SSC (Voc) fail to pass the final examination. No data is available on the pass rate of \nHSC (Voc).  \n\nThe  low  pass  rate  for  SSC  (Voc)  can  be  attributed  to  a  number  of  factors  affecting \n10. \ninstruction quality. One is the short supply of qualified TVET teachers. The sudden expansion of \nTVET  programs,  particularly  private  and  nongovernment,  has  not  been  matched  by  an  equal \nsupply  of  teachers.  The  majority  of the  teachers  hired  have  no  training  on  pedagogy  and  lack \nindustry  experience;  no  continuing  staff  development  is  available  to  address  this  deficiency. \nBTEB  estimates  that  about  24,000  TVET  teachers  in  the  private  sector  need  training.  In \naddition, all teachers need to be trained in the new competency-based curricula. Monitoring of \nactual teacher performance in the classrooms or workshops is lacking.  \n\n11. \nThe  capacity  of  TVET  teacher  training  institutions  is  limited.  The  Vocational  Teachers \nTraining  Institute  (VTTI)  has  capacity  for  training  240  teachers  only,  and  focuses  training  on \ndeveloping new teachers for eight trades. The Technical Teachers Training College (TTTC) has \ncapacity for 80 teachers, but has been producing fewer graduates. In addition, VTTI and TTTC \nserve only the MOE TVET teachers, leaving other training providers (i.e., government, private, \nor NGO) to seek other TVET teacher training programs. The VTTI and TTTC programs need to \nbe  refocused  to  provide  good  quality  training,  including  in-service  training,  to  more  TVET \nteachers  from  both  MOE-  and  non-MOE-administered  institutions.  The  facilities  of  VTTI  and \nTTTC need to be upgraded and capacity increased to provide outreach to private/NGO sector \nteachers. \n\nLack  of  equipment  compounds  the  situation  in  most  training  institutions,  in  some \n12. \ninstances  outdated  equipment  or  equipment  is  no  longer  operating.  In  some  schools  new \nequipment is not used as instructors have not been trained in its operation. Consequently, the \npractical component of the curriculum is not effectively taught. And since most of the institutions \ndo not have a linkage with industry, the industry attachment component of the curriculum is not \neffectively implemented.  \n\n13. \nRelevance  of  Training  Programs.  Ultimately,  the  main  measure  of  success  of  the \nTVET system if it is to significantly contribute to poverty reduction is whether its graduates find \ngainful  employment,  preferably  in  the  trade  areas  they  are  trained  for.  A  World  Bank  tracer \nstudy  in  2006  involving  2,302  graduates  of  public  and  private  TVET  institutions  in  2003  found \nthe proportion of employed to be low (see Table A2.1). The proportion of employed was highest \namong the higher secondary certificate (vocational) (HSC [Voc]) graduates at 30%, followed by \ndiploma graduates at 21%, and basic trades at 18%. These courses, however, account for only \na small proportion of total enrollment. While the lowest proportions of employed were among the \nSSC (Voc) graduates (4%) and HSC (business management) graduates (5%), the proportions \nof their graduates pursuing higher education were the highest. This finding indicates that these \ncourses appear to be catering to a clientele who can afford to pursue higher education and have \nstrong  white-collar  job  aspirations;  this  is  not  consistent  with  the  objectives  of  the  national \npoverty  reduction  strategy.  Across  all  the  respondents,  only  9%  were  employed,  45%  were \npursuing higher education and the rest were unemployed. Of those who were employed, about \n38% took less than 6 months to get a job and another 16% took up to a year. The employment \noutcomes of graduates of the public and private institutions indicated little difference.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\f28 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n \n\nTable A2.1: Distribution of Formal TVET Students After Graduation \n\nItems \n\nEmployed \n(%) \n14.1 \n  3.1 \n28.6 \n  4.7 \n 18.2 \n  7.3 \n\nSelf-Employed \n(%) \n4.0 \n0.9 \n1.1 \n0.7 \n2.4 \n1.3 \n\nBasic Trades \nSSC (Voc) \nHSC (Voc) \nHSC (BM) \nDiploma and Others \nTotal \na Totals may not add up to 100.0 due to rounding-off. \nNote: The number of respondents is 2,302.

The  identification  of  courses  is  not  based  on  regular  and \nsystematic  assessment  of  market  needs  but  rather  more  in  response  to  social  demand. \nEmployers have no inputs in setting competency standards for the courses or in determining the \ncurriculum. On the other hand, successful NGOs such as Under-Privileged Children\u2019s Education \nProgram,  Mirpur  Agricultural  Workshop  and  Training  School,  and  the  industry-managed \nChittagong Skills Development Center provide models of effective TVET training programs. The \nhigh  employment  rate  of  the  graduates  of  their  short  and  long  courses  demonstrates  the \nimportance of strong linkage with industry, which is one of their main strengths. The process of \nselecting  students  is  mainly  dependent  on  academic  marks  and  external  examinations,  and \ndoes not consider aptitudes and aspirations. \n\n15. \nThe formal TVET system has minimal impact on the economy and poverty reduction; of \nthe total labor force in 2003, only 0.12% received technical training from the system. One of the \nfeatures  of  the  existing  system  is  its  focus  on  long  courses  such  as  the  SSC  (Voc)  and  HSC \n(Voc); the majority of successful graduates pursue further studies. While this helps keep young \nadolescents in school, it is an expensive route for accessing further education. Also contributing \nto  the  low  output  is  the  lack  of  formal  BTEB  recognition  of  successful  NGO  and  industry \ndelivered programs such as those offered by Mirpur Agricultural Workshop and Training School, \nCaritas,  Under-Privileged  Children\u2019s  Education  Program,  other  NGOs,  and  the  construction \nindustry.  \n\n16. \nTVET can be made more relevant to the informal sector. The productivity of the sector \ncan be improved by upgrading skills in certain occupations, e.g., motorbike repair, repair of farm \nimplements,  food  processing,  and  carving.  Mirpur  Agricultural  Workshop  and  Training  School, \nBangladesh  Rural  Advancement  Committee,  and  other  successful  NGOs  have  a  number  of \ntraining  programs  catering  to  the  informal  rural  subsector  that  have  high  employment  rates. \nUsually  these  are  linked  with  microcredit.  Such  programs,  which  incorporate  modules  on \nentrepreneurship,  can  be  mainstreamed  by  converting  to  competency-based  training  (CBT) \n(some  already  are)  and  recognized  by  BTEB  so  that  they  can  be  scaled  up  with  Government \nand  development  agency  support.  The  competency-based  approach \ntraining \nemphasizes the acquisition of skills used in the workplace. Skills are according to the standards \nrelated to industry\u2019s needs. Often, CBT is delivered in modules. Students progress to the next \nmodule  after  demonstrating  acquisition  of  the  skill  rather  than  after  a  fixed  time  frame,  and \nstudents can potentially complete training programs faster. \n\nto  skills \n\n17. \nOne  of  the  main  features  of  the  formal  TVET  system  is  limited  opportunities.  All  its \nprograms, including the 6-month basic trades and SSC (Voc), require class 8 as minimum entry \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 2 \n\n29 \n\nqualification.  This  automatically  excludes  the  majority  who  do  not  complete  class  8.  The  main \nclientele are mostly male (share of female enrollment is only 26%) who are not necessarily poor. \nThe TVET system needs to urgently diversify its clientele if it is to be an effective instrument for \npoverty reduction. Quality CBT modular courses offer the best vehicle for the TVET system to \nreach out to the poor. Opening the TVET system to the older poor through short CBT courses \nthat  do  not  necessarily  require  class  8  for  enrolment  will  significantly  increase  its  output, \nmaximize the utilization rate of facilities, reduce unit cost, and make the system truly relevant. \nGender policies promoting more female participation can also be implemented. \n\n18. \nGovernance  and  Management  Structure. The scope of the TVET subsector is much \nwider  and  more  diverse  than  generally  understood.  It  encompasses  a  large  number  of \ninstitutions  and  activities.  However,  its  impact  has  hardly  been  felt,  partly  because  its  various \ncomponents  lack  a  unifying  vision  in  which  each  has  a  clearly  defined  role.  The  need  to \nrationalize  the  disparate  efforts  in  TVET  by  putting  it  under  a  single  regulatory  framework  to \nprovide a unified and coherent direction was acknowledged as early as 1979 with the creation of \nthe  National  Council  for  Skills  Development  and  Training  (NCSDT).  NCSDT  was  to  provide \nmacro-level policy direction and other national services related to skills training, coordinate the \nefforts of different agencies involved in skills training to avoid duplication of efforts, and develop \nnational  competency  standards.  Despite  the  reconstitution of  its  membership  in  1991,  NCSDT \nhas  not  functioned  as  intended.  Several  factors  have  been  cited  for  its  lack  of  effectiveness, \nincluding  (i)  membership  is  too  big  and  difficult  to  coordinate  and  organize,  although  this  was \npartly addressed in the revised composition; (ii) many members do not have the expertise nor \ninterest  in  formulating  policies  related  to  the  development  of  the  workforce  for  crafts;  (iii)  the \nNCSDT  secretariat  (Bureau  of  Manpower,  Employment  and  Training  [BMET])  does  not  have \nsufficient resources and expertise to provide the necessary support to NCSDT; and (iv) BMET \nlacks autonomy, which is needed for effective functioning as the NCSDT secretariat. \n\n 19.  While the initial attempt to provide a unified governance and management structure did \nnot  work  as  expected,  the  need  for  it  remains  even  more  valid  and  urgent  today.  The  options \nare either to reactivate NCSDT and build on the existing legal framework, or create a completely \nnew but equivalent body. Presently, MOE has overall responsibility for making policy decisions \nfor  all  education,  including  technical  and  vocational  education.  The  execution  of  policies  is \nvested in two of its agencies: Directorate for Technical Education and BTEB. Under the existing \ninstitutional  arrangements,  a  major  component  is  conspicuously  missing\u2014the  involvement  of \nprivate sector representatives, including employers, private training providers, and NGOs. They \nneed to be involved not only for strategy and policy but for operations as well.   \n\n20. \nThe management of training institutions needs to be addressed. Although BMET seems \nto  be  progressing  in  decentralization,  the  overly  centralized  system  of  the  Directorate  for \nTechnical  Education  does  not  allow  its  principals  to  manage.  They  do  not  have  authority  to \ndecide  on  key  areas  necessary  for  effective  functioning  of  their  institutions,  e.g.,  hiring  of \nteachers, discontinuing low-demand programs,  and offering market-demanded programs. With \nclear guidelines and transparent procedures, heads of institutions should be able to select their \nteachers  for  approved  posts  and  have  the  authority  to  reward  or  penalize  depending  on \nperformance.  They  should  also  be allowed  to  hire  on  a  part-time  basis.  The  authority  to  close \ndown courses in trade areas with low market demand so that the resources can be channeled to \nthe  more  promising  areas  should  also  be  provided.  With  respect  to  short  courses,  principals \nshould  even  have  greater  authority  to  be  able  to  respond  quickly  to  market  needs.  However, \nwhile  autonomy  is  certainly  needed  if  management  is  to  be  accountable  for  performance, \nmanagement\u2019s  readiness  to  assume  greater  responsibility  must  be  considered.  Thus,  a \ncontinuing management development program to build management capacity is needed.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\f30 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n \n\nAnother  area  that  needs  urgent  attention  is  the  information  system  for  the  subsector. \n21. \nAggregated  and  time-series  data  for  planning  and  managing  that  are  normally  available  in \ngeneral  education  are  not  available  for  TVET.  These  include  data  on  the  number  of  TVET \nproviders  by  type  and  location,  programs,  enrolment,  teachers,  attendance  rate,  dropout  rate, \ncompletion rate, pass rate, and unit cost. A TVET management information system equivalent to \nthe education management information system of general education is needed.  \n\n \n\n\f \nLessons  \n \n1.  Need industry linkage.  \n\n2.  Competency-based training (CBT) \n\nprovides several advantages over time-\nbased qualifications, but its \nrequirements must be analyzed and \naddressed, including development, \nteacher training, equipment, and \nawareness.   \n\n4.  Labor market analysis and tracer \n\nstudies are important for proper \ndirection and feedback to training \nsystems.  \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n31 \n\nLESSONS  \n\nIncorporating Lessons Identified  \nin Project Design \n\nSector working committees (SWCs) will be established. SWCs \nwill  identify  occupational  areas  where  more  personnel  are \nneeded,  and  articulate  employer  and  industry  requirements. \nTraining  institutions  that  will  be  eligible  for  project  resources \nwill  have  an  advisory  council  with  industry  and  employer \nmembers. \n\nIndustry representative experts will form part of the SWCs that \nwill  develop  the  competency  standards.  In-service  teacher \ntraining  will  include  the  delivery  of  CBT  courses.  Selected \ntraining  institutions  will  be  provided  with  training  equipment \nwhile  others  will  receive  funds  for  equipment  repair.  Public \nawareness campaigns on CBT will be conducted.     \n\nTraining  programs  to  be  offered  will  be  based  on  the \nrequirements  of  the  Project\u2019s  respective  focus  industries.  In \ncommunities,  the  Government  will  work  with  nongovernment \norganizations to undertake training needs assessments. After \nsome  training  programs  have  been  conducted  and  before \nproject  completion,  tracer  studies  of  the  trainees  will  be \ncommissioned. The Project will strengthen the capacity of the \npersonnel of the Directorate of Technical Education (DTE) and \nthe project implementation unit (PIU) to analyze labor market \ndemand.  \n\n3.  Use of training funds can spur \n\nreallocation of resources to high priority \nactivities and clientele, and stimulate \ncompetition between public and private \ntraining providers.  \n\nThe Project pilots the use of a pool of funds for the provision \nof  skills  training.

The  industry  sector  leads  recent  growth  performance  in  Bangladesh, \n1. \nfollowed  by  the  services  sector.  As  a  result,  the  economy  is  experiencing  a  gradual  structural \ntransformation  that  requires  a  more  technically  skilled  labor  force.  At  the  same  time, \ninternational  demand  for  Bangladeshi  labor  is  growing.  During  1995\u20132005,  about  2.58  million \nBangladeshi  workers  were  working  outside  of  the  country,  of  which  48%  were  unskilled,  15% \nsemiskilled,  33%  skilled,  and  only  4%  professional.  To  withstand  increasing  competition  from \nother labor-exporting countries, continuous skills upgrading is required. \n \nLabor  Supply.  However,  with  the  growing  demand  for  skilled  labor,  a  sizeable \n2. \nproportion  of  the  labor  force  has  insufficient  or  inappropriate  schooling.  Of  those  that  are \nschooled,  only  58,000  workers  (55,000  male  and  5,000  female)  in  the  labor  force  received \ntechnical or vocational education; this represents 0.12% of the 46.3 million in the labor force. \n \n3. \nShortcomings of the Technical and Vocational Education (TVET) System. A major \nweakness  of  the  current  TVET  system  is  the  considerable  mismatch  between  the  system\u2019s \noutputs  and  labor  market  needs.  The  poor  condition  of  the  TVET  system  is  the  result  of  \n(i)  teaching  equipment  lacking  or  malfunctioning,  (ii)  industrial  attachment  component  of  the \ncurriculum rarely implemented, and the curriculum not relevant to or in demand by the industry, \n(iii)  shortage  of  qualified  teachers  with  practical  skills,  and  (iv)  focus  on  long  courses.  The \nsystem could greatly enhance its output by utilizing its slack capacity for the more employment-\noriented  short  courses  and  older  students.  The  overall  impact  of  the  current  TVET  system  on \nthe economy is modest. A tracer study conducted by the World Bank involving 2,302 graduates \nof both public and private TVET institutions concluded that about 9% of TVET graduates were \nemployed (7.3% wage-employed and 1.3% self-employed), 45% were pursuing further studies, \nand 47% were unemployed. \n \n4. \nSolutions and Project Contribution. The Project responds to the analyzed needs and \nweaknesses  of  the  TVET  system  and  aims  to  increase  its  efficiency  and  effectiveness.  It  will \nenhance the relevance of the training programs for the domestic and international labor markets \nby piloting a partnership mechanism between the key players on the supply and demand side in \nthree  crucial  industry  sectors:  textiles  and  garments,  construction,  and  light  engineering.  In \naddition, a select group of nongovernment organizations (NGOs) involved in the development of \nnonfarm technical skills will be organized to address the needs for technical skills of the informal \nsector.  \n \n5. \nBy  upgrading  the  facilities  and  learning  materials,  through  training  of  teachers  in \nselected TVET institutions, and the provision of market-oriented short courses, the Project will \ndirectly  benefit  more  than  68,000  out-of-school  youths,  and  unemployed  and  underemployed \nadults who will graduate from the short competency-based training (CBT) courses of the public \nand  selected  private  institutions  during  the  5  years  of  project  implementation.  An  additional \n20,000 students are expected to take short courses after project completion. Also about 4,000 \nteachers  will  directly  benefit  from  intensive  teacher  training  to  upgrade  their  technical  and \npedagogical skills. In addition, the more than 50,000 students that attend certificate and diploma \ncourses  in  these  institutions  every  year  will  indirectly  benefit  from  the  Project  as  their  courses \nwill be taught by better trained teachers in better equipped facilities. This is expected to result in \n\n                                                 \n1 Supplementary Appendix D provides more detailed economic, poverty impact, and financial analyses. \n\n \n\n\f52 \n\n \n\nAppendix 16 \n\n \n\nEconomic  Internal  Rate  of  Return  (EIRR).  To  assess  the  economic  efficiency  of  the \n\nbetter employment outcomes. In addition, the Project will build the capacity of these institutions \nto provide short CBT courses to more than 100,000 trainees per year who are denied access to \nlong courses because of the class 8 barrier to entry.  \n \n6. \nProject, the economic internal rate of return (EIRR) over 20 years was estimated.  \n \n7. \nEconomic  Benefits.  The  economic  benefits  are  derived  mainly  from  (i)  increased \naccess  to  skills  training;  and  (ii)  improved  relevance  and  quality  of  skills  training  through  the \npartnership  with  employers,  revision  of  curriculum,  and  teacher  training  components.  The \neconomic  impacts  are  estimated  using  future  salary  increments  as  a  result  of  completing \nmarket-oriented short-term skills training. The estimate is based on conservative assumptions, \nusing  the  minimum  wage  of  local  workers  in  the  ready-made  garments  and  construction \nindustries, rather than market wages. Increase in access is represented by increased enrollment \nin  new  short-term  training  programs.  The  Project  will  fund  the  cost  of  an  additional  68,200 \nstudents  in  short-term  training  programs  in  5  years,  36,000  through  the  strengthened  TVET \ninstitutions  and  32,200  through  the  market-responsive  skills  training  programs.  The  additional \ntraining will be terminated by project completion, although about 20,000 students are expected \nto continue to take short-term courses on a cost-recovery basis after the Project. Two types of \nemployment opportunities are available after training: local and international labor markets. The \nanalysis  assumes  that  unemployed  and  unskilled  workers  will  become  semiskilled  workers  by \nobtaining  the  appropriate  skills  through  training.  Improved  relevance  and  quality  of  training \nraises labor productivity and is measured by the extent to which training completers earn more \nthan the minimum wage. Similarly, improved relevance of training will improve the employability \nof  graduates,  and  will  hence  result  in  a  higher  employment  probability.2  The  teacher  training \nprograms  will  also  have  a  spillover  effect  on  the  employability  of  secondary  school  certificate \n(vocational)  graduates,  which  will  improve  by  benefiting  from  training  from  better  trained \nteachers in better equipped institutions.  \n \n8. \nEconomic Costs. The economic costs are divided into (i) investment cost of the Project, \n(ii)  recurrent  cost,  and  (iii)  private  and  opportunity  costs.  The  total  cost  of  the  Project,  net  of \ntaxes, is estimated at $58.9 million. Recurrent cost includes additional administrative expenses \nof improving the provision of short-term training. After the Project, the recurrent cost remains at \nits fifth year value of $0.6 million. Private costs include the out-of-pocket expenses of trainees \nfor a short-term, 3-month training program. The opportunity cost is equivalent to the income that \na trainee would otherwise receive when not engaged in the short-term training. Based on these \nassumptions (Table A16.1), the Project is estimated to yield a net present value of $47.4 million, \nassuming a discount rate of 12.0%. The EIRR is estimated at 13.9%. The actual EIRR is likely \nto be higher in view of economywide multiplier effects of remittances. \n \nSensitivity  Analysis.  A sensitivity analysis was undertaken on the basis of alternative \n9. \nassumptions  on  the  extent  to  which  the  Project  achieves  improved  access  and  external \nefficiency for local and overseas employment. In the low case scenario, improvements through \nthe project are 25% less than the target, the high case scenario implies 125% achievement of \nthe targets. The results can be found in Table A16.2: \n\n                                                 \n2    In the formal TVET system, the World Bank survey (see Appendix 2) found that 18% of the respondents with basic \nskill  certificates  were  employed.  While  no  aggregate  data  were  available  on  the  employment  rates  of  short-term \nprograms  outside  the  formal  TVET  system,  discussions  and  meetings  with  successful  NGOs  and  labor  brokers \nindicated  very  high  employment  rates  for  their  graduates.  Given  this  information  and  that  the  Project  will  be \nsupporting short-term training programs, a 50% baseline value is assumed for the employment rate of graduates of \nthese programs without the Project.      \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 16             53 \n\n                              \n\nTable A16.1: Assumptions for Economic Internal Rate of Return Estimates \nEconomic Benefit of Increased Access\nImpact of short-term vocational training on annual salary \nTrainees who were unemployed and seek local employment  \nTrainees who were unemployed and seek international employment  \nTrainees who were unskilled workers and seek local employment  \nTrainees who were unskilled workers and seek international employment \n\n$681 \n$1,920 \n$200 \n$1,439 \n\n  \n  \n\nEconomic Benefit of Improved Quality of Training\nDegree of improvement in earning  \n\nEconomic Benefit of Improved External Efficiency\nJob placement rate among training completers without Project  \nJob placement rate among training completers with Project \nProportion of completers taking up international employment  \n\nEconomic Cost of Proposed Project\nAnnual recurrent cost after the Project  \nPrivate cost (per training program per trainee)  \nOpportunity cost (per training program per trainee)  \n\n  Source: Asian Development Bank staff estimate.  \n\n \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n 5% \n\n50% \n75% \n12.5% \n\n$626,000 \n$19 \n$120 \n\nEconomic Internal Rate of Return \n\nTable A16.2: Economic Internal Rate of Return  \nBaseline  Less 25% \n\n1.

The Project will contribute to poverty reduction \nin  two  ways.  First,  it  will  promote  expansion  of  the  scope  of  the  current  TVET  system  toward \nserving the poor. The current system predominantly  offers longer courses, which are costly to \nthe poor. By focusing on short courses that do not necessarily require class 8 for enrolment, the \nProject improves the opportunities for the poor to enter the TVET system. Secondly, the Project \naddresses also the needs of poor communities. The Project will support the plan of the Ministry \nof  Education  (MOE)  to  introduce  short-term  skills  training  in  poor  communities.  Project \nassistance will be provided in two modes: (i) establishment of multipurpose training workshops \nfor  vocational  trade  courses  in  selected  schools,  and  (ii)  assistance  to  selected  TVET \ninstitutions to provide skills training. The multipurpose training workshops will be used to provide \nskills  training  to  community  members,  particularly  the  unemployed  and  underemployed  school \nleavers, women, and adults, including those from poor communities (about 7,200 trainees). \n \nC. \n \nThe  financial  analysis  determines  the  fiscal impact  and  the  sustainability  of  the  Project \n11. \non  the  Government\u2019s  budget  during  the  5  years  project  implementation.  The  Government\u2019s \nshare  in  the  Project  is  estimated  at  $16.7  million  over  5  years  and  will  comprise  mainly \nincremental  recurrent  cost,  taxes  and  duties,  and  a  share  in  special  programs.  Two  scenarios \nwere  prepared  to  analyze  its  affordability  (i)  a  high  case  scenario  where  the  Government \neducation  budget  was  projected  for  2008  to  2013  based  on  the  trend  of  actual  budgets  from \n1999 to 2005; and (ii) a low case scenario where the education budget remains at its projected \n\nFinancial Analysis \n\n \n\n\f54 \n\n \n\nAppendix 16 \n\n \n\n2008  level  until  2013.  For  both  scenarios,  the  annual  share  of  the  Government  in  the  project \ncost,  together  with  estimated  commitments  in  two  ongoing  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)-\nfunded  projects,  the  Secondary  Education  Sector  Development  Program  and  the  Teaching \nQuality Improvement Project,3 are computed as a percentage of the annual education budget. \nIn  the  high  case  scenario,  the  Government\u2019s  annual  commitment  as  a  percentage  of  the  total \neducation budget averages 0.85% over the 5-year life of the Project. In the low case scenario, \nthe  Government\u2019s  annual  commitment  as  a  percentage  of  the  education  budget  increases  to \n0.93% over the 5-year life of the Project. The Government\u2019s share in the Project constitutes a \nsmall  proportion  of  the  overall  education  budget,  and  is  hence  deemed  sustainable  from  a \nfinancial perspective. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n                                                 \n3  ADB.  2004.

Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \nBangladesh\u2019s  national  poverty  reduction  strategy  (NPRS)  recognizes  the  potential  contribution  of  technical  and \nvocational education and training (TVET) to reducing poverty by providing employable skills, particularly to those who \ndropped  out  of  school  early  and  are  already  of  employable  age,  and  to  the  large  pool  of  unemployed  and \nunderemployed  adults.  Skills  training  can  play  a  major  role  in  giving  people  income-earning  opportunities.  Skills \ntraining  in  occupational  areas  needed  by  the  labor  market  increases  the  likelihood  of  employment  and  self-\nemployment  of  trainees.  The  poverty  reduction  strategy  calls  for  reform  of  the  TVET  system  by  making  it  more \nmarket-responsive, addressing training needs of the underprivileged who do not complete class 8, collaborating with \nthe private sector and nongovernment organizations (NGOs), and making its training programs more flexible in terms \nof duration, curriculum, and students\u2019 academic qualifications, among others. \nThe  Skills  Development  Project  (the  Project)  addresses  the TVET  needs  in  Bangladesh.  Focusing  mainly  on  short \ncompetency-based training (CBT) courses, the Project will open the formal TVET system to out-of-school youth who \nare  of  employable  age,  women,  and  unemployed  and  underemployed  adults.  It  will  extend  the  system\u2019s  reach  to \npoverty  areas  in  collaboration  with  its  industry  and  NGO  partners.  The  Project  also  aims  to  improve  the  relevance \nand quality of TVET programs.  \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                  Targeting Classification: General intervention  \n1.  Key Issues  \nBangladesh\u2019s formal TVET system produces a low number of training graduates and thus has a minimal impact on \npoverty reduction. The main clientele are currently the youth, about three-quarters of whom are male, who complete \nclass 8 and have strong white-collar job aspirations. The class 8 barrier, the minimum entry requirement to the formal \nTVET system, automatically excludes the large majority, many of whom are poor and do not complete schooling up \nto  that  level.  The  formal  TVET  system  also  does  not  recognize  good  training  provided  by  agencies  not  under  the \numbrella of the Ministry of Education (MOE) nor does it recognize good training provided by NGOs. The relevance \nand quality of its formal training programs are low; employment and pass rates of graduates need to be increased. \nThe matching of skills training programs need to be improved to increase the employment rates of trainees.  \nTraining programs can be made more flexible in terms of duration (more short-term, modular training) and academic \nqualifications  (less  than  class  8),  and  made  more  relevant  by  coordinating  with  employers,  industries,  and  NGOs. \nQuality  can  also  be  improved  by  providing  training  institutions  with  the  appropriate  equipment,  a  regular  supply  of \ntraining materials, and TVET teachers with pedagogical and technological training. \n2. Design Features \nThe Project will strengthen the capacity of the TVET systems to provide market-responsive, short-term skills training \nto more Bangladeshis. Short, modular CBT courses will be developed and will provide greater flexibility, in terms of \nduration  and  academic  qualification  requirements.  The  training  programs  will  not  necessarily  require  class  8  for \nenrolment,  which  will  expand  access  to  the  TVET  system  to  those  that  did  not  reach  this  required  level,  many  of \nwhom  are  poor.  The  facilities  of  TVET  institutions  will  be  upgraded  to  expand  the  capacity  for  delivering  short, \nrelevant  training  programs  and  thus  will  provide  more  space  for  students.  The  Project  will  also  establish  training \nworkshops in selected poor communities, which will make training more accessible to the poor. Thus, the Project will \nopen TVET institutions to a larger number of trainees in short CBT courses, most of whom would have been denied \naccess  because  of  the  class  8  barrier  to  entry.  As  the  training  programs  will  be  demand-driven  and  based  on \nindustry-set  or  recognized  standards,  opportunities  for  employment  and  self-employment  opportunities  of  trainees \nwill improve.     \n\nII. \n\nSOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\nA.  Findings of Social Analysis  \nBangladesh made big strides in human development from the 1980s to the 2000s. In education, the primary gross \nenrollment  rate  is  over  100%  and  gender  parity  has  been  achieved  in  both  primary  and  secondary  education. \nBangladesh\u2019s population growth rate was halved over two decades, and infant mortality rates decreased by a quarter \nbetween 1989\u20131993 and 1995\u20131999. However, despite this progress, it has remained one of the poorest countries in \nthe  world,  with  more  than  half  of  its  citizens  living  below  the  poverty  line.  Many  Bangladeshi  households  are \nvulnerable to income risks. In addition to shocks faced by individuals, e.g. illness, death, and dowries, the country is \nprone  to  repeated  natural  disasters  in  the  form  of  floods,  droughts,  cyclones,  and  riverbank  erosion,  which  affect \nbroad segments of the population. These challenges are compounded by a population density of roughly 800 people \nper square kilometer\u2014one of the highest in the world. Although poverty in urban areas is lower than in rural areas, it \n\n \n\n\f56 \n\n \n\nAppendix 17 \n\n \n\nis on the rise, mainly due to rural\u2013urban migration. Heads of poor households have lower education attainment than \nin  nonpoor  households.  Every  year,  after  planting  the  main  rice  crop,  the  poorer  section  of  the  population,  who \ndepend mostly on agriculture, become underemployed, if not unemployed.  \nYouth coming from poor households are less likely to complete class 8. Once they have left school, some find work \nopportunities  without  specific  skills  training.  During  project  preparation,  school-leavers  expressed  interest  in \nvocational training, however opportunities are limited. While good short vocational training may be offered by some \nNGOs, until recently, the Government has not taken any step to recognize them. Employers and training providers \nindicate  that  not  all  occupations  require  class  8.  Vocational  training  can  be  offered  as  a  short  program  and  in  a \nmodular  manner  over  time.  Employers,  particularly  those  that  are  export-oriented,  expressed  the  need  for  more \ntrained workers to meet the demands of the market and remain competitive in the international market.  \n\nB.  Consultation and Participation \n\n1.  Provide a summary of the consultation and participation process during the project preparation. \nConsultation  with  a  variety  of  stakeholders  was  undertaken  using  focus  group  discussions,  workshops,  and \ninterviews. Focus group discussions included TVET students, parents, TVET teachers and trainers, and employers in \nthe six divisions of Bangladesh. Employers, industry associations, and development partners were also consulted. \n2.  What level of consultation and participation (C&P) is envisaged during the project implementation and monitoring? \n\n No  \n\n  Collaborative decision making     \n\n  Consultation      \n Yes    \n\n  Information sharing       \n3.  Was a C&P plan prepared? \nConsultation  and  participation  of  representatives  of  industries  and  major  NGOs  will  be  undertaken  in  the  Project. \nMembers of the sector working committee will mostly be from industries and employers to identify the needed skills \ntraining.  TVET  institutions  that  will  receive  funds  for  upgrading  their  program  facilities  will  have  advisers  from  the \nindustries and employers. In working with poor communities, the Project will work with NGOs to identify their training \nneeds.  Information  dissemination  activities,  among  others,  will  be  undertaken  and  will  include  the  use  of  popular \nmedia  to  reach  out  to  youth  and  project  a  positive  image  of  productive  TVET.  A  social  marketing  plan  will  be \nprepared and implemented. \n\n Empowerment \n\nC.  Gender and Development \n\n1.  Key Issues \nWith  the  share  of  agriculture  in  the  national  product  decreasing,  the  employment  of  women  is  also  being \ntransformed. Between 1995 and 2003, women in the labor force grew from 5.4 million to 10.3 million, and their labor \nforce participation rate increased from 15.8% to 26.1%. This increase is largely fueled by the growth of the textiles \nand  ready-made  garments  industries.  Moreover,  15,000  women  took  up  international  employment  during  1991\u2013\n2000, mainly as skilled labor to the manufacturing subsector and as household maids to Middle East and Southeast \nAsian  countries.  Occupational  patterns  differ  between  men  and  women.  A  higher  proportion  of  women  (88%)  are \nemployed in agriculture than men (56%). Men earn more than women. In the formal manufacturing subsector, 19% \nof  women  as  opposed  to  9%  of  men  earn  below  the  poverty  line.  Operations  of  the  ready-made  garment  industry \ndepends  exclusively  on  women  workers.  In  2003,  ready-made  garments  employed  about  1.4  million  women, \ncomprising 93% of its workforce. The skills needed for the job are mostly self-taught or acquired on the job. On the \njob, little investment is made by the ready-made garment  entrepreneurs or government to upgrade the skills either \nprior  to  entry  in  the  labor  force  or  during  employment.  If  the  ready-made  garment  subsector  were  to  diversify  into \nhigher quality and more skill-intensive products, which is already happening in knitted garments, female workers will \nneed to be upgraded. \nThe experience in nonformal education activities indicate that women prefer skills that do not take them out of their \nhomesteads. This results in acquiring traditional skills like poultry raising, embroidery, and tailoring. However, these \nskills cannot ensure a decent income. Employment opportunities for women were and still are limited compared with \nthose  for  men.  The  factors  that  contribute  to  limited  job  opportunities  for  women  include  lack  of  social  recognition, \nlack  of  education,  lack  of  skills  training,  restrictions  on  women\u2019s  mobility,  lower  social  status  of  women,  and  strict \ngender division of labor. Researchers  a are suggesting that the efficiency of women workers needs to be increased \nby reducing the gender gap in education and training, by introducing schemes for upgrading technology in market-\nbased  activities  within  households,  and  improving  the  institutional  setup  that  impacts  on  women-dominated \nindustries.  \nWomen's lower participation in TVET contributes to their limited access to the labor market. Women are employed in \nlower-skilled  occupations,  occupying  the  lower  range  of  vocational  skills  that  are  gender-stereotypical.  Of  the  over \n241,000 students enrolled in TVET in 2005, 26% were girls, who were mostly enrolled in secondary school certificate \n(vocational)  and  higher  secondary  certificate  (vocational)  programs;  data  for  enrolment  in  short-term  training \nprograms  is  not  available.  Of  the  more  than  200  operating  government  institutions,  only  one  is  for  women.  More \nrecently,  the  Government  established  four  polytechnics  for  women  in  four  divisional  districts  and  initiated  the \nestablishment of two more in another two divisional districts.  \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 17             57 \n\n                             \n\n2.

This  includes  provision  of  daily  training  allowance,  as  appropriate,  and \naccommodations in training institutions\u2019 hostels, where available. (ii) The venue for skills training \nassisted  by  the  Project  will  be  open  to  all,  including  indigenous  groups.  (iii)  In  recruiting  new \nteaching  and  training  staff  in  communities  with  indigenous  people,  given  equal  qualifications, \npriority  will  be  given  to  residents  of  the  immediate  community.  (iv)  A  gender  and  indigenous \npeoples  specialist  will  support  project  implementation,  including  helping  develop  a  situation \nanalysis,  strategy,  and  action  plan  for  the  participation  of  indigenous  people  in  skills  training.  \n(v) The project implementation unit (PIU) and the Directorate of Technical Education (DTE) will \ncollect  project  baseline  ethnicity-disaggregated  data,  and,  thereafter,  regularly  collect  and \nmaintain ethnicity-disaggregated data in its database. (vi) The PIU, in cooperation with DTE will \nregularly analyze project output and impact indicators, including by ethnicity.  \n \nB. \n \n2. \nThe project activities are not expected to have a negative impact on indigenous people, \nrather,  implementation  will  improve  the  quality  and  relevance  of  skills  training  for  all  who  are \neligible  and  would  like  to  avail  of  it.  This  will  contribute  to  increasing  the  likelihood  of \nemployment after training.  \n \n3. \nWith the increased interaction between government training program developers and the \nindustry  through  sector  working  committees  (SWCs),  competency  standards  and  training \ncurricula  will  have  greater  relevance  to  the  needs  of  the  labor  market.  The  provision  of  in-\nservice  teacher  training  and  improvement  in  the  facilities  of  certain  training  programs  will \nimprove the quality of training. The provision of training equipment will provide students with the \nopportunity to access practical training and thus improve the quality of their training.  \n \n4. \nMore skills training programs will be offered in occupational areas immediately needed \nby  the  labor  market.  Training  will  be  short  and  competency-based,  with  the  competency \nstandards  and  training  standards  specified  in  coordination  with  industries.  The  training \nadmission  eligibility  standards  will  be  specified  in  coordination  with  industry  associations \naccording to the occupations\u2019 skill standards. Training programs will be  open to everyone and \nwill  be  held  in  venues  that  do  not  restrict  admission  to  any  indigenous  group.  Multipurpose \ntraining  workshops  will  be  constructed  in  poor  communities  for  skills  training  delivery;  the \ncommunity skills training programs will respond to labor market needs. \n \n5. \nBy  offering  more  short  training  programs  that  do  not  necessarily  require  completion  of \nclass 8 for eligibility, more Bangladeshis, including many indigenous people, will be able to avail \nof  skills  training.  Daily  training  allowance  will  be  provided  to  poor  students,  some  of  whom \nbelong  to  indigenous  groups,  to  reduce  the  cost  of  attendance.

Projects  are  categorized  by  the  significance  of  their  impacts  on \nindigenous people. The significance is decided by scrutinizing the type, location, scale, nature, \nand magnitude of a project\u2019s potential impacts.  \n \n7. \nAn indigenous peoples development framework is a policy and procedural framework for \nindigenous  peoples  development  plans  that  are  developed  for  subprojects,  components,  or \ninvestments,  and  are  approved  during  loan  implementation.  The  Government  will  prepare  a \nspecific action for indigenous people groups for subprojects with limited impacts on indigenous \npeoples or when there is a risk that the project may not bring intended benefits to the affected \nindigenous peoples within a specific plan. \n \n8. \nAn  indigenous  peoples  development  plan  addresses  (i)  aspirations,  needs,  and \npreferred  options  of  those  affected;  (ii)  local  social  organization,  cultural  beliefs,  ancestral \nterritory,  and  resource  use  patterns  among  those  affected;  (iii)  potential  positive  and  negative \nimpacts; (iv) measures to avoid, mitigate, or compensate for the adverse effects; (v) measures \nto ensure project benefits will accrue to indigenous peoples; (vi) measure to strengthen social, \nlegal, and technical capabilities of government institutions to address indigenous people issues; \n(vii)  the  possibility  of  involving  local  organizations  and  nongovernment  organizations  with \nexpertise in indigenous people issues; (viii) budget allocation; and (ix) monitoring. \n \nAn indigenous peoples\u2019 specific action may take the form of (i) incorporating indigenous \n9. \npeoples (who might be excluded) into the project beneficiary group, (ii) incorporating indigenous \npeoples\u2019 specific needs into the project plan, and (iii) a common community action plan where \nindigenous peoples live with non-indigenous peoples in the same project location. \n \n10. \nAsian Development Bank for review and concurrence. \n \nD.  \n \n11. \nThe  gender  and  indigenous  peoples  specialist  will  assist  the  PIU  in  implementing  this \nstrategy,  including  capacity-building  of  PIU  and  relevant  DTE  personnel  for  screening  project \nactivities. The project director, with the support of the head of the PIU monitoring and evaluation \nunit,  will  undertake  required  screening  for  project  impacts  on  indigenous  people.  Where \napplicable and necessary, the specialist will assist the PIU develop a corrective action plan for \nindigenous people to have equal access to the training program. \n \nE.  \n \n12. \nThe Executing Agency, the Ministry of Education, will be responsible for monitoring and \nevaluation  of  activities  related  to  indigenous  peoples.  The  Project  will  collect  ethnicity-\ndisaggregated  data.  The  PIU  will  regularly  analyze  project  output  and  impact  indicators, \nincluding by ethnicity. The gender and indigenous people specialist will build the capacity of the \nPIU and relevant DTE personnel to collect ethnicity-disaggregated project data and ensure that \nmonitoring  and  evaluation  procedures  include  indicators  for  monitoring  impact  on  the \nbeneficiaries.  Where  applicable  and  despite  all  efforts,  indigenous  peoples  still  have  unequal \naccess to project skill development activities, DTE will provide funding from the project budget \nfor a corrective action plan if such corrective action is necessary. \n\nThe  indigenous  peoples  development  plans  or  specific  actions  will  be  submitted  to  the \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nMonitoring and Evaluation \n\n \n\n\f", "author_pages": ["CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 07 May 2008) \n", "Currency Unit\n", "taka (Tk) \n", "\u2013 \n", "= \n= \n", "TK1.00\n$1.00\n", "$ 0.0146     \nTk68.575 \n", "ADB \nBMET \nBTEB \nCBT \nDTE \nEC\u2013ILO \nEIRR \nGDP \nHSC (Voc) \nMOE \nNCB \nNCSDT \nNGO \nNPRS \nPIC \nPIP \nPIU \nPSC \nSDR \nSOE \nSSC (Voc) \nSWC \nTTC \nTTTC \nTVET \nVTTI \n", "ABBREVIATIONS \n \nAsian Development Bank \nBureau of Manpower, Employment and Training \nBangladesh Technical Education Board \ncompetency-based training \nDirectorate of Technical Education \nEuropean Commission and International Labour Organization \neconomic internal rate of return \ngross domestic product \nHigher Secondary Certificate (Vocational) \nMinistry of Education \nnational competitive bidding \nNational Council for Skills Development and Training \nnongovernment organization \nnational poverty reduction strategy \nproject implementation committee \nprogram improvement plan \nproject implementation unit \nproject steering committee \nspecial drawing rights \nstatement of expenditure \nSecondary School Certificate (Vocational) \nsector working committee \ntechnical training center \nTechnical Teachers Training College \ntechnical and vocational education and training \nVocational Teachers Training Institute \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "NOTES \n \n", "(i) \n", "(ii) \n", "The fiscal year (FY) of the Government ends on 30 June.
