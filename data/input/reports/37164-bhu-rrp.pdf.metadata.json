The \neconomy is  not sufficiently diversified, and growth has depended \nheavily  on  the  hydropower  sector,  which  accounts  for  45%  of \nnational revenues. This is due mainly to limited investment and a \nweak private sector. Thus, to sustain growth in the medium term, \nthe  Government  is  placing  high  priority  on  developing  the \ncountry\u2019s  private  sector  and \ninvestment \nenvironment.  One  of  the  key  constraints  to  increased  private \nsector  participation  is  limited  access  to  finance  for  entrepreneurs \nand a lack of matching financial services that meet the diversified \nneeds  of  businesses.  Moreover,  a  conducive \ninvestment \nenvironment would depend critically on a sound, stable, and well-\nregulated financial system. \n \nThe  proposed  reforms  under  the  FSDP  are  fully  in  line  with  the \nGovernment\u2019s development objectives and the country strategy of \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB).  The  FSDP  is  designed  to \nstrengthen  governance  in  the  financial  sector\u2014including,  among \nother  aspects,  the  legal,  regulatory  and  supervisory  framework, \ngovernance structure and operational efficiencies, and institutional \ncapacity  of  the  financial  sector\u2014with  the  aim  of  improving  the \ndepth, soundness,  and stability of the financial system and thereby \n\nimproving \n\nthe \n\n\f \n\nbolster  business  confidence,  encourage  private  sector  activity, \nand foster sustained economic growth. \n \n\nthrough \n\n \nLoan Amount and Terms \n\n \nProgram Loan Objectives  The  FSDP  aims  to  address  the  main  constraints  in  the  financial \nsystem  that  impede  financial  sector  development  and  efficient \nfinancial  intermediation.  The  main  constraints  include  (i)  a  weak \nlegal,  regulatory,  and  supervisory  regime;  (ii)  poor  governance \nstructures  and  inefficient  operations  of  financial  institutions;  (iii) \nvulnerability  to  malpractice  for  lack  of  effective  anti-money \nlaundering (AML) and combating the financing of terrorism (CFT) \nregimes;  (iv)  the  absence  of  national  accounting  and  auditing \nstandards;  and  (v)  an  inadequate  system  of  financial  information \nimproved \ndisclosure.  Consequently,  FSDP  aims, \ngovernance,  specifically  to  enhance  the  investment  environment, \nimprove access to finance, and promote market-based incentives \nfor  providing  diversified  financial  services  aimed  at  encouraging \nprivate sector activity and promoting economic growth. \n \nIt  is  proposed  that  ADB  support  the  Government\u2019s  policy  reform \nprogram  by  providing  a  program  loan  of  SDR7,472,000  ($11 \nmillion  equivalent)  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources.  The \nBorrower will be the Government. The loan will have a fixed term \nof  24  years,  including  a  grace  period  of  8  years.  The  interest \ncharge will be 1.0% per annum during the grace period, and 1.5% \nper  annum  thereafter.  The  loan  proceeds  are  expected  to  be \nutilized over a period of 36 months from the date of effectiveness. \n \nThe FSDP will be for 3 years. The program loan will be released \nin  three  tranches.  The  first  tranche  (not  exceeding  $4  million \nequivalent) is to be disbursed upon loan effectiveness, subject to \nGovernment  fulfillment  of  all  prior  actions  required  under  the \nFSDP. The  second tranche (not exceeding $4 million equivalent) \nwill  be  disbursed  18  months  after  program  loan  effectiveness, \nupon  satisfactory  fulfillment  of  the  corresponding  tranche  release \nconditions.  The  third  tranche  ($3  million  equivalent)  will  be \ndisbursed  18  months  after  the  second  tranche,  subject  to \nsatisfactory  fulfillment  of  the  corresponding  tranche  release \nconditions. The  policy matrix  (Appendix  4)  lists  the conditions  for \nthe release of the three tranches. The program period will be from \nJanuary 2007 (or loan effectiveness) to December 2009. \n \nThe Ministry of Finance (MOF) will be the Executing Agency (EA) \nfor  the  FSDP,  and  the  implementing  agency  (IA)  for  two \ncomponents: \n(ii) \ndeveloping  accounting  and  auditing  standards.  The  Royal \nMonetary  Authority  (RMA)  will  be  the  IA  for  the  other  three \ncomponents:  (i)  strengthening  regulation  and  supervision  of  the \nfinancial sector, (ii) establishing an AML/CFT framework, and (iii) \nestablishing a credit information bureau (CIB). \n \n\n \nExecuting and \nImplementing Agencies \n\n \nProgram Period and \nTranching \n\nimproving  corporate  governance  and \n\n(i) \n\n \n\nii \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\niii\n\nProcurement and \nDisbursement \n\n \nCounterpart Funds \n\n \nProject Loan Objectives \n\n \nCost Estimate and \nFinancing Plan \n\n \nPeriod of Utilization \n \nEstimated Project \nCompletion Date \n \nExecuting and \nImplementing Agency \n\n \nProcurement and \nConsulting Services \n\nimports \n\nProgram  loan  proceeds  will  be  used  to  finance  the  foreign \nexchange  cost  of  items  produced  and  procured  in  ADB  member \ncountries  other  than  items  specified  in  the  list  of  ineligible  items \n(Appendix  7)  and \nfinanced  by  other  bilateral  and \nmultilateral  sources.  The  Government  will  certify  that  the  volume \nof  eligible  imports  exceeds  the  amount  of  ADB\u2019s  projected \ndisbursement  under  the  loan  for  the  given  period.  ADB  reserves \nthe  right  to  audit  the  use  of  the  loan  proceeds  and  to  verify  the \naccuracy of the Government\u2019s certification. \n \nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  the  local  currency  funds \ngenerated  by  the  program  loan  will  be  used  to  support  the \nadjustment costs of reforms under the FSDP.   \n \nThe purpose of the project loan is to facilitate the implementation \nof  the  FSDP  and  ensure  the  smooth  implementation  and \nsustainability of its policy reforms. The project loan will provide (i) \nurgently needed training of the regulator and key institutions in the \nareas covered under the FSDP, (ii) the development of adequate \nAML/CFT  regulation  and  infrastructure,  (iii)  improved  accounting \nand auditing practices, (iv) technical support to create a CIB, and \n(v) improved securities information disclosure.  \n \nThe  total  project  cost  is  estimated  at  $2.5  million,  including \ncontingencies  and  financial  charges.  It  is  proposed  that  ADB \nsupport  project  implementation  with  a  loan  of  SDR1,359,000  ($2 \nmillion  equivalent)  from  its  Special  Funds  resources.  The  project \nloan will have a fixed term of 32 years, including a grace period of \n8 years. An interest rate charge will be 1.0% per annum during the \ngrace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter. \n \nUntil 30 June 2010  \n \n31 December 2009 \n\n(iv) \n\nframework, \nimproving  securities \n\n \nMOF will be the EA for the project and the IA for the component \non  improving  accounting  and  auditing  practices.  RMA  will  be  the \nIA  for  the  components  on  (i)  building  sector  capacity,  (ii) \n(iii)  supporting  CIB \nestablishing  an  AML/CFT \ninformation \nestablishment,  and \ndisclosure.  \n \nProcurement  of  goods  and  services  will  be  subject  to  the \nprovisions of ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2006). A total of 24 \nperson-months of international consulting services and 21 person-\nmonths  of  national  consulting  services  will  be  financed  by  the \nproject loan from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources. Consultants will \nbe  recruited  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants (2006). The project will also finance the secondment \nand  training  programs  for  medium  to  long-term  technical  training \nin specialized financial areas.  \n\n \n\n\fiv \n\n \n\n \nBenefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nRisks and Safeguards \n\nto \n\nlending \n\nopportunities \n\nresponsiveness \n\n \nThe FSDP promotes a better-regulated financial system with more \neffective enforcement and operation under the principles of good \ngovernance. It encourages the development of more efficient and \ncommercially  oriented  financial  institutions,  especially  banks,  to \nengender  competition  and  thereby  invigorate  the  private  sector, \npromote economic growth, and reduce poverty.  \n \nThe  strengthened  supervisory  and  regulatory  framework  for  the \nbanking  and  securities  markets  and  the  development  of  a  much-\nneeded  framework  for  insurance  will  contribute  to  financial \nsoundness and protect depositors, investors, and insurance policy \nholders. The improved corporate governance structure, enhanced \noperational  efficiencies,  and  human  resource  development  will \nenhance \nand \nperformance  incentives,  thus  contributing  to  greater  efficiency  of \nfinancial intermediation. \n \nEstablishing  a  CIB  and  developing  Bhutanese  accounting  and \nauditing  policies  and  standards  will  improve  the  quality  of  credit \nassessment  and  financial  disclosure  of  financial  institutions.  The \ndisclosure and sharing of credit profiles by financial institutions will \nboost lenders\u2019 confidence, help mitigate risk and lower the cost of \nfinance, and consequently benefit the private sector.  \n \nAn effective AML/CFT framework will strengthen general investor \nconfidence  in  the  financial  system,  as  it  will  deter  criminal  and \ncorrupt elements from using the system to launder their proceeds. \nIt  will  also  contribute  to  improving  Bhutan\u2019s  image  as  having  a \nwell-managed and disciplined financial system. \n \nMuch-needed \nfor  FSDP \nimplementation will fast track skills development in the supervisory \nand  regulatory  authority  and  among  financial  institutions  to \neffectively  implement  the  provisions  of  new  legislation.  They  will \nfurther strengthen the foundation of the financial system and help \nit  cope  with  the  challenges  of  liberalization  and  private  sector \ndevelopment. \n \nWhile  a  potential  risk  to  FSDP  implementation  is  how  the \nGovernment  will  implement  the  reforms  and  follow  through,  it  is \nfully  committed  to  the  needed  reforms,  as  evidenced  by  its \npronouncements  and  actions  taken  up  front.  The  work  on \nstrengthening \nlegal  and \nregulatory  framework  and  financial  sector  supervision\u2014e.g.,  the \nrevised  RMA  Act  and  draft  Financial  Services  Act  (FSA)\u2014has \nprogressed  for  some  time,  and  official  comments  from  other \nfunding  agencies  (e.g.,  International  Monetary  Fund)  have  been \nreceived  and  incorporated  into  the  revised  RMA  Act  and  draft \nFSA. In addition, the draft acts will be finalized by the Government \nas conditions for loan effectiveness.  The Government has shown \n\ncapacity  building \n\nlegal  provisions \n\ncomponents \n\nimproving \n\nthe \n\nfor \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nTechnical Assistance \n\n \n\nv\n\nstrong  ownership  of  the  needed  financial  sector  reforms  through \nextensive consultation with stakeholders and ADB. In addition, the \nrevised  RMA  Act  has  been  submitted  to  the  cabinet  and  is \nexpected to be presented to the National Assembly for enactment \nby  end-2006  to  give  RMA  greater  autonomy  to  carry  out  the \nregulation and supervision of all financial institutions and activities.  \n \nAnother  potential  risk  for  successful  FSDP  implementation  is \ninadequate institutional capacity in RMA and the relevant financial \ninstitutions  to  carry  out  the  reform  agenda.  The  FSDP  therefore \nplaces  strong  emphasis  on  consultation  and  technical  training  to \nensure  awareness  and  broad  ownership  of  the  reforms.  More \nspecifically,  training\u2014including  medium  and  long-term  training \nand secondment programs will be provided to the EA and IAs on, \namong  others  topics,  regulatory  and  supervisory  skills,  securities \nmarket  operations,  insurance  underwriting,  and  accounting  and \nauditing.  The  piggy-backed  technical  assistance  (TA)  will  further \nenhance and sustain the effectiveness of the financial training for \nthe regulatory authority and financial professionals.  \n \nResistance from vested interests to certain reform measures is a \npotential  risk.  This  relates  particularly  to  strengthening  the \ngovernance  structure  and  operations  of  financial  institutions. \nResistance  may  arise  over  reform  measures  for  regulating \ncorporate governance of the Bank of Bhutan Limited (BOBL) and \nthe  Royal  Insurance  Corporation  of  Bhutan  Limited  (RICBL). \nHowever,  the  Government  has  expressed  its  strong  support  and \nfurther confirmed that the revised RMA Act will give RMA greater \nautonomy to regulate corporate governance. The FSDP also has \nmeasures  to  ensure  that  RMA  will  be  able  to  regulate  and  take \nremedial  action  to  enforce  corporate  governance  under  the  FSA \nlegislation and relevant regulations. \n \nFurthermore, at the level of the individual financial institution, both \nBOBL and RICBL have taken initiatives to prepare new business \nplans  and  improve  measures  for  assessing  credit  risk  and \nmanaging human resources, with TA support from the South Asia \nEnterprise  Development  Facility  of  the  International  Finance \nCorporation, \ninstitutional  performance.  These \ninstitutional  initiatives  will  complement  the  proposed  reform \nmeasures for good governance under the FSDP and help improve \nthe operational efficiency of financial institutions.  \n \nIn conjunction with the FSDP, TA is proposed for institutionalizing \nskills  and  capacity  development  in  the  financial  sector.  The \nestimated  cost  of  TA  is  $312,000,  of  which  ADB  will  finance \n$250,000 as a grant from its TA funding program. TA consultants \nwill  be  recruited  using  the  consultant\u2019s  qualification  selection \nmethod according to ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \n(2006). \n\nimprove \n\nto \n\n \n\n\f\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n \nI  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  report  and  recommendation  on  the  proposed \n1. \nFinancial  Sector  Development  Program  (FSDP) \nthe  Government  of  Bhutan  (the \nGovernment), consisting of (i) a program loan to support policy reforms and (ii) a project loan to \nfacilitate program implementation. This report also discusses the proposed technical assistance \n(TA)  grant  for  institutionalizing  skills  and  capacity  development  in  the  financial  sector.  If  the \nBoard  of  Directors  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  approves  the  proposed  loans,  the \nPresident of ADB, acting under the authority delegated to him by the Board, will approve the TA.    \n \n\nfor \n\nII. \n\nTHE SECTOR: PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES  \n\nSector Description and Performance1 \n\n \nA. \n \n2. \nDespite strong economic growth in recent years, Bhutan remains a small economy and a \npoor country with a national poverty rate of 32%. Real economic growth has averaged about 7% \nsince 1970s, and gross domestic product (GDP) per capita has increased from $51 in 1960 to \n$834 in 2005. The GDP was approximately $673 million, and national revenues $760 million, in \n2005.  However,  economic  growth  has  been  narrowly  based,  driven  mainly  by  growth  in  the \nhydropower sector and its related industries, which account for about 12% of the country\u2019s GDP \nand 45% of national revenues. As the hydropower sector has low employment elasticity, such \nhigh dependence on hydropower development and limited involvement from the private sector \npose  a  challenge  for  the  country  as  the  labor  market  seeks  to  absorb  the  growing  number  of \nnew  entrants.  An  estimated  50,000  young  people  will  enter  the  labor  market,  and  another \n20,000 people will migrate from rural to urban areas by 2007. The Government therefore places \na high priority to private sector development to diversify economic activity, stimulate economic \ngrowth, and generate employment. To achieve this, developing the country\u2019s financial sector is \nnecessary  to  improve  access  to  finance,  diversify  existing  financial services,  and  enhance  the \ninvestment environment overall. \n \n3. \n In  parallel  with  low  business  activity,  the  financial  sector  in  Bhutan  remains  relatively \nsmall  and  underdeveloped.  It  comprises  the  banking  sector  and  non-bank  financial  sector. \nThere are two commercial banks in the banking sector, the Bank of Bhutan Limited (BOBL) and \nthe Bhutan National Bank Limited (BNBL). The two non-bank financial institutions (NBFIs) are \nBhutan  Development  Finance  Corporation  Limited  (BDFCL)  and \nInsurance \nCorporation  of  Bhutan  Limited  (RICBL).  There  is  a  National  Pension  and  Provident  Fund \n(NPPF). Bhutan also has a stock exchange, the Royal Securities Exchange of Bhutan Limited \n(RSEBL), four securities brokers,2 and a depository.  \n \n4. \nMuch  of  Bhutan\u2019s  financial  development  to  date  has  related  to  the  monetization  and \nmobilization  of  government  and  private  savings.  Financial  deepening,  measured  by  the  broad \nmoney-to-GDP ratio, has increased considerably from 31.7% in 1996 to 52.7% in 2005, due to \nincreases  in  government  and  corporate  deposits  in  commercial  banks.  However,  the  private \nsector  has played  a  relatively  minor  role  in  the  evolution  of  the  financial  sector.

BOBL is a state-owned bank,5 \n5. \nwhile  BNBL  is  a  privately  owned  bank6  in  which  the  Government  holds  a  minor  share.  Total \nlending by the two commercial banks was Nu7.86 million in mid-2005, up from Nu5.04 million in \nincrease.7  Banks  reported  acceptable  risk-based  capital  ratios  and \n2004,  or  a  56% \nnonperforming  loan  (NPL)  ratios  lower  than  those  in  the  non-bank  sector.8  However,  because \nthey cannot fully employ their excess liquidity, their return on assets (ROA) and return on equity \n(ROE)  ratios  are  below  optimal.  Excess  liquidity  in  the  banking  system  indicates  (i)  banks\u2019 \n\n                                                 \n3   The  gap  between  the  broad  money  (money  aggregate,  M2)  and  domestic  credit  is  used  here  as  a  proxy  to \nmeasure  the  excess  liquidity  and  the  amount  of  idle  financial  assets  that  could  potentially  be  used  for  credit \nexpansion  and  investment.  The  International  Monetary  Fund  (IMF)  uses  the  amount  of  deposits  with  the  Royal \nMonetary Authority (RMA) (in % of total financial assets) as a proxy for excess liquidity. These two are appropriate \nmeasures  and  are  also  readily  available  to  illustrate  the  excess  liquidity  issue  in  Bhutan. The  gap  has  increased \nfrom 19% in 1996 to 47% in 2004 and slightly decreased to 32% in 2005. Currently, 31% of total financial assets \nare deposited with RMA, according to IMF data. \n\n4  There is limited scope for the conduct of monetary policy as the ngultrum is pegged to the Indian rupee, and the \nGovernment is reluctant to issue treasury instruments to mop up excess liquidity due to the attendant costs. The \nIMF is working with the Government to address this issue to allow for more flexible monetary operations. \n\n5   The Government owns 80% of BOBL, and the rest is owned by the State Bank of India. \n6   The Government currently owns about 13.6% of BNBL, ADB 10.0%, National Provident and Pension Fund 25.7%, \n\nBhutan Trust Fund 10.0%, Royal Insurance Corporation of Bhutan 2.1%, and the public 38.6%. \n\n7   Nonetheless, credit to the private sector decreased by 22% on average. See Appendix 1 for more sector analysis. \n8   As of December 2005, the NPL ratio was 6.56% for banks and 20.90% for non-banks.  \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n3\n\ninability  to  quickly  deploy  resources  generated,  (ii)  their  lack  of  operational  efficiency,  and  (iii) \nlimited bankable projects. 9   \n \n6. \nThere has been little change in interest rates since liberalization in 1999. Lending rates \naveraged 13% from 1997 to 2005, despite minor adjustment in housing loans. Deposit rates (for \nsavings  and  time  deposits  of  less  than  1  year)  ranged  from  9%  between  1997  and  2000  to \naround 5% since 2000. The interest rate spreads have, as a result, widened from 6% in 2000 to \n8%  in  2005.  The  two  commercial  banks  currently  require  high  collateral  for  lending  to \nbusinesses. High interest rate spreads and stringent collateral requirements are characteristic of \na  lack  of  alternative  funding  sources  and  the  absence  of  effective  competition  in  the  banking \nsystem.   \n  \n\n2. \n\nNBFIs10 \n\n \n7. \nNBFIs  continue  to  be  underdeveloped,  accounting  for  11.7%  of  total  assets  of  the \nfinancial  system,  compared  with  88.3%  for  banks.  The  two  NBFIs,  BDFCL  and  RICBL,  are, \ndespite  their  respective  specific  mandates  to  provide  development  finance  and  insurance, \nheavily involved in commercial lending, due to limited investment opportunities in the domestic \nmarkets and profitability concerns.   \n \n \nDevelopment  Finance  Corporation.  BDFCL\u2019s11  main  sources  of  funds  are  external \n8. \nconcessional  loans  and  grants  from  international  agencies.  As  a  result,  the  risk-based  capital \nratio  was  an  astonishing  49.0%.12  BDFCL  lends  to  private  sector  industrial  clients  and  also  to \nsmall  and  medium-sized  enterprises  (SMEs)  and  agricultural  businesses  that  do  not  meet  the \ncollateral  requirements  specified  by  the  commercial  banks.  BDFCL\u2019s  ROA  ratio  of  6.6%  and \nROE ratio of 14.8% in 2005 were acceptable. However, the NPL ratio of BDFCL is the highest, \nat  22.2%  of  total  loans  as  of  year-end  2005.  This  is  due  to  its  exposure  to  small  loans  in  the \nrural and agricultural sectors, thereby providing cause for concern and resulting in poor liquidity. \nNevertheless,  BDFCL\u2019s  NPL  ratio  has  been  decreasing  steadily  since  2000  as  a  result  of \ndiversification of its portfolio away from agricultural loans. Agriculture lending represented 17% \nof  BDFCL\u2019s  loan  portfolio  in  2005,  down  from  40%  in  2000,  indicating  a  risk  that  SMEs  and \nagriculture projects may find it difficult to borrow at reasonable rates.13  \n \n9. \nInsurance.  RICBL  provides  life  and  general  insurance.  Premiums  charged  are \ncomparable  with  those  of  insurance  providers  in  India.  RICBL\u2019s  insurance  portfolio  is  fairly \nconventional,  given  the  demographics  of  the  market  in  Bhutan.  General  insurance  is  split  into \nthe  three  main  classes  of  business\u2014fire,  marine  (transport),  and  miscellaneous  (including \ncompulsory motor insurance). The life products sold are mostly identical to those offered by the \nLife  Insurance  Corporation  of  India.  RICBL  also  operates  the  Government\u2019s  rural  insurance \nscheme, covering over 56,000 households in 2004. The use of reinsurance is very high, and the \nreinsurers  are  often  used  as  underwriters  on  big  projects,  as  there  is  little  underwriting \n\n                                                 \n9   The  Small  and  Medium-Sized  Enterprises  (SME)/Micro-enterprise  Development  Program  included  in  the  country \nprogram for 2007 will have a component for enhancing business development services to support SME growth and \nso increase bankable projects in the market.  \n\n10  Non-bank financial institutions are development finance corporations and insurance companies.  \n11  Currently 87% owned by the Government of Bhutan, 7.5% by BOBL, 3% by RICBL, and 2.5% by BNBL. \n12 BDFCL is a non-depository financial institution, and its equity, mostly sourced from grants, reserves, and retained \n\nearnings, is well above the minimum requirement.  \n\n13  The SME/Micro-enterprise Development Program scheduled in 2007 under the country program will target SMEs \nand micro-enterprises, particularly  in the rural areas,  and  BDFCL  will be a key financial institution to  achieve the \nobjective for channeling funds to the enterprises.    \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\nexperience  in  RICBL.  The  insurance  loss  ratio is  currently  low,  although  claims  in  the  general \nbusiness area are beginning to rise.   \n \n10. \nRICBL  engages  in  consumer  lending,  credit  card  operations,  and  housing  finance. \nRICBL utilizes insurance premiums to make investments, and its investment portfolio is split into \n(i)  credit  products  (80%),  (ii)  equity  investments  (10%),  (iii)  real  estate  (construction  and \nproperty  management,  5%),  and  (iv)  liquid  resources  (5%).  Forty-four  percent  of  the  loan \nportfolio is in housing loans, which have a maximum term of 20 years. The fact is that RICBL is \nnot  operating  as  a  true  insurance  company,  according  to  international  best  practice,  but  as  a \nfinancial  institution  that  happens  to  be  the  sole  provider  of  insurance  products  in  the  country. \nThe  RICBL  is  at  present  implicitly  regulated  under  banking  rules  and  regulations  which  only \napply to its commercial lending activities. \n \nThe  Government  Employees  Provident  Fund,  which  RICBL  had  managed  since  1976, \n11. \nwas transferred to NPPF, a public sector autonomous body, in April 2000.14 However, while the \nsource of funding was transferred, the portfolio of loans and investments was kept with RICBL. \nConsequently,  by  2005,  RICBL  had  a  liquidity  shortfall  of  Nu77  million  due  to  increasing \ndemand  for  credit  from  existing  clients  combined  with  difficulty  accessing  funds.  RICBL\u2019s  NPL \nratio was 19.8% as of end-2005. The high NPL ratio is traceable to poor credit decisions. RICBL \ncurrently  transfers  the  entire  retained  premium  (premium  earned  minus  reinsurance  premium \npaid) to its credit and investment department, which pays a guaranteed interest of 7% on the life \naccount and 8% on the general account, accrued daily and accounted for on a quarterly basis. \nThe  life  and  general  funds  are  not  truly  segregated  as  recommended  by  the  International \nAssociation of Insurance Supervisors (IAIS).  \n \n12. \nPensions. NPPF is the biggest institutional investor in Bhutan, with approximately 15% \nof total financial assets. The pensions market is relatively untapped in Bhutan. Currently, there \nis no national pension scheme for private sector or self-employed workers. Some private sector \nenterprises  provide  pensions  for  their  employees  via  the  companys\u2019  provident  funds.  RICBL \nmanages 28 private provident funds. NPPF runs the provident funds for the armed forces, state-\nowned enterprises\u2019 employees, and the civil service. It is presumed that NPPF will be allowed to \noffer  pension  products  to  private  individuals  in  the  future.  Currently,  there  is  no  pension \nregulation. However, the new Pension Act was recently finalized with assistance from the United \nNations Development Programme (UNDP).  \n \n3. \n \n13. \nRSEBL  was  incorporated  in  1993  under  the  Companies  Act  (1982)  and  Financial \nInstitutions  Act  (1992).  Its  initial  Nu2  million  authorized  capital  was  provided  by  BOBL,  BNBL, \nBDFCL,  and  RICBL,  the  four  institutions  with  brokerage  firms  licensed  to  serve  as  dealer-\nbrokers.  Today,  RSEBL  is  owned  by  the  four  dealer-broker  members.  The  law  forbids  trading \npublicly  issued  shares  outside  the  stock  exchange,  subject  to  exemptions  from  RSEBL.  Initial \npublic offerings (IPOs) of shares also must be done on RSEBL. As of June 2006, there were 16 \nlisted  companies,  little  secondary  trading,  and  approximately  16,000  owners  of  listed  shares. \nRSEBL  also  hosts  primary  offerings  of  larger  amounts  of  government  and  Royal  Monetary \nAuthority (RMA) debt. Total trading value of government debt in 2004 amounted to Nu1.6 billion \n\nSecurities Market and Intermediaries \n\n                                                 \n14 ADB provided technical assistance to the separation and the introduction of the new pension scheme. (ADB. 1998. \nTechnical  Assistance  to  the  Kingdom  of  Bhutan  for  Upgrading  the  Royal  Insurance  Corporation  of  Bhutan, \nRestructuring the Government Employees Provident Fund and Introducing a Pension Scheme (Financed by Japan \nSpecial Fund). Manila [TA 3111-BHU, approved on 7 December].) \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n5\n\ndue  to  the  issue  of  a  series  of  Druk  Air  Corporation  bonds  guaranteed  by  the  Government. \nThere is no secondary market in debt.15 \n \n14.  Market  capitalization  of  listed  companies  was  Nu4.3  billion  in  2004,  or  18.9%  of  GDP, \nand Nu4.5 billion in 2005, or 15% of GDP. The total value of shares traded on the secondary \n(post-distribution) market at RSEBL amounted to Nu20.8 million in 2005, down from Nu108.81 \nmillion  in  2004,  the  most  active  year.  The  Druk  Air  Corporation  Limited  IPO  was  the  main \nreason for the high 2004 trading volume. There was no trading in six of the 16 listed companies \nand only one IPO in 2005. Several factors contributed to the low volume of secondary trading. \nFirst, share price information is not always up to date and available and, second, brokers do not \nadvertise investment opportunities in the securities exchange. Third, brokers\u2019 regulations are not \nproperly  implemented  and  there  is  no  oversight  of  the  exchange.  As  a  result,  there  is  a  small \nnumber of investors and low investor confidence and interest.    \n \nB. \n \n\nIssues and Opportunities \n\n1. \n \n\nInadequate Legal and Regulatory Framework  \n\n \n15. \nThe  financial  sector  is  small  and,  as  a  whole,  not  adequately  regulated  or  supervised. \nRMA  is  the  sole  regulator  and  supervisor  of  the  financial  system,  including  the  securities \nexchange. The authority to regulate and supervise is delegated under the RMA of Bhutan Act \n(1982),  FIA  (1992),  and  Prudential  Regulations  (2002).  However,  under  existing  laws,  the \nregulatory  framework  and  guidelines  are  ill-defined,  particularly  for  insurance  and  pensions. \nRegulation  and  supervision  are  also  ineffective  for  lack  of  institutional  capacity,  non-\nenforcement, and inconsistency with international standards and best practices. Therefore, the \nfirst  priority  of  financial  sector  development  is  to  fill  the  gaps  under  the  existing  laws  and \nregulations  to  enable  adequate  oversight  over  the  whole  financial  system  to  promote  a  sound \nand  stable  investment  environment  conducive  to  private  sector  growth  and  economic \ndevelopment.  The  issues  to  be  addressed  for  strengthening  the  existing  legal  and  regulatory \nframework follow.   \n \n16. \nFirst,  RMA  requires  greater  autonomy  in  the  conduct  of  its  statutory  functions,  both \nmonetary and regulatory. Greater autonomy and freedom of action are essential to strengthen \nthe  ability  of  RMA  in  its  exercise  of  monetary  policy  (however  limited  at  this  time)  and  in  its \noversight of the operations of the financial sector, including state-owned and controlled financial \ninstitutions.  \n \n17. \nSecond,  several  weaknesses  in  existing  banking  supervision  need  to  be  removed  to \nenhance  the  oversight  of  banks.  The  Prudential  Regulations  (2002)  for  banking  supervision \nwere  issued  in  line  with  the  Basel  Committee\u2019s  Core  Principles.  The  Financial  Institutions \nSupervision  Division  (FISD)  in  RMA  uses  the  so-called  CAMEL16  supervisory  framework  to \nmeasure the risks inherent in each financial institution. However, the current CAMEL framework, \nin the absence of an analysis of sensitivity to market risk, does not allow financial institutions to \n\n                                                 \n15 Developing a secondary debt market requires several critical ingredients, including (i) a critical mass of investors \nand issuers of securities; (ii) a network of financial intermediaries that is ready to buy and sell securities to support \nthe primary market; (iii) the availability of financial instruments that meet the yield, liquidity, risk, and maturity profile \ndemanded by investors; (iv) the existence of a reliable yield curve that reflects actual market sentiments in pricing \nsecurities;  and  (v)  an  adequate  legal  and  regulatory  framework  that  protects  investors\u2019  and  issuers\u2019  interests. \nConsequently,  without  a  developed  private  sector,  the  market  for  securities  is  highly  limited.  Currently,  RMA  is \nrequesting the International Monetary Fund to provide assistance toward further developing the domestic debt and \ninterbank markets.  \n\n16  Capital adequacy, asset quality, management, earnings, and liquidity. \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\ngauge  risks  arising  from  fluctuations  in  interest  rates  or  exchange  rates.  This  is  important, \nparticularly  in  view  of  future  banking  competition  and  the  possible  liberalization  of  exchange \nrates. For off-site supervision, banks and NBFIs are subject to detailed monthly, quarterly, and \nannual  reporting  requirements.  But  standards  have  yet  to  fully  conform  with  international \nstandards  and,  in  a  number  of  cases,  are  neither  uniform  nor  consistent  across  the  sector  (in \nthe absence of national accounting and auditing standards and a uniform chart of accounts for \nfinancial  institutions).  Other  banking  regulations  not  conforming  to  international  standards \ninclude  (i)  a  relatively  low  capital  requirement  compared  with  neighboring  countries  and  other \nemerging markets and (ii) a lenient timeframe for nonperforming loan classification, resulting in \napparently  insufficient  NPL  provisioning.  The  FSDP  therefore  proposes  updating  and  revising \nexisting banking regulations to address these issues.  \n \n18. \nNo adequate bank-licensing requirements or regulations exist for allowing new entrants \nin  the  banking  market  and  improving  competition.  RMA  has  recently  received  a  couple  of \ndomestic and foreign applications for bank licenses. Due to insufficient screening requirements \nand licensing procedures, RMA is not able to grant bank licenses with adequate consideration \nof the impact of entry or the needs of the financial sector. Therefore, the provision of clear and \nconsistent  bank-licensing  regulations  and  procedures  is  necessary  to  engender  a  more \ncompetitive environment for banks operating in Bhutan. (More details are in Appendix 1: Sector \nand Subsector Analysis.) \n \n19. \nThird,  in  the  absence  of  explicit  regulations  over  insurance  and  pensions,  RMA\u2019s \noversight of these two businesses is limited to loan portfolios. It is therefore a priority to develop \nadequate  regulations  and  supervision  for  the  two  sectors  and  fill  the  gaps  under  the  existing \nlegal and regulatory framework for all financial service providers.17 Recently, UNDP finalized the \nPension  Act  (para.  12)  for  establishing  pension  regulations.  Regarding  insurance  regulations \nand, particularly in view  of the current expansion of credit activities in RICBL, the priority is to \nset  out  principles  and  practices  covering  solvency  margins,  the  admissibility  of  assets,  and \nreserve  requirements  for  different  classes  of  businesses  conforming  with  the  IAIS  core \nprinciples.  \n \n20. \nA need also exists to develop new off-site financial reporting formats and standards and \nlicensing  requirements  for  domestic  and  foreign  insurers.  An  appropriate  management  and \nmonitoring system coupled with corresponding reserving requirements can allow more accurate \nmatching  of  assets  and  liabilities  and  ensure  an  efficient  and  safe  insurance  market  for  the \nbenefit  and  protection  of  policyholders.  The  other  important  element  to  ensure  efficiency  and \nstability in the insurance market is licensing. Strict conditions governing the formal approval of \ninsurance  companies  and  an  adequate  licensing  process  are  necessary  to  ensure  fair \ncompetition in the market. \n  \nFourth,  as  a  regulator,  RMA  is  not  given  the  power  to  investigate  and  prosecute \n21. \nsecurities violations for licensed and other companies or individuals. Regulations on brokers are \nvery limited and not always enforced. RMA, acting as the securities commission, regulates the \nsecurities  exchange,  RSEBL,  under  the  provisions  of  the  Companies  Act  (2000),  Securities \nExchange  Regulation  (1993),  Control  of  Brokers  Regulations  (1993),  RSEBL  Listing  Rules \n(1993), and Rules of the Exchange (1993). However, it is not clear whether the law allows RMA \nto regulate the market with respect to people unaffiliated with the entities it licenses, including \ncompelling  them  to  furnish  testimony,  documents,  or  other  evidence.  There  is  also  no  written \nprocedure for RMA\u2019s on-site inspections of the securities exchange or for inspections of brokers \n                                                 \n17  Financial  services  providers  include  banks,  development  finance,  insurance,  securities  brokers,  securities \n\nexchanges, and others. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n7\n\nby the securities exchange or RMA. In addition, no adequate securities regulation exists for (i) \nproviding a proper matching for buyer and seller obligations for trade settlement; (ii) defining at \nwhich  point  beneficial  ownership  of  securities  passes  to  enable  delivery  versus  payment;  (iii) \nissuer disclosure on control and related-party transactions; (iv) internal controls and inspections \nof the depository; or (v) strengthening documentation requirements in the trading, clearing, and \nsettlement system. To boost investor confidence and encourage investors to enter the securities \nmarket,  it  is  essential  to  address  these  issues  and  further  strengthen  the  securities  market\u2019s \nlegal and regulatory framework. \n \nIn  2003,  ADB  provided  TA18    and,  in  2005,  project  preparatory  TA19  addressing  these \n22. \nissues.  A  draft  financial  services  act  (FSA),  which  extends  RMA\u2019s  regulatory  and  supervisory \nauthority  in  the  insurance  sector  and  securities  market,  was  prepared  along  with  the  revised \nRMA  Act  and  relevant  regulations.  The  draft  FSA  is  structured  to  bring  banking,  insurance, \nsecurities,  and  other  financial  services  under  a  unified  legislative,  regulatory,  and  supervisory \nframework. However, because of limited understanding of the content of the law, initial progress \nin finalizing the draft FSA and related regulations has been slow. Subsequently, through project \npreparatory TA support, the process of review and consultation has made substantial progress.  \n \n\n2. \n\nWeak Governance, Structure, and Operations of Financial Institutions \n\ntransactions \n\nthat  have  not  been \n\n \n23.  While there is strong commitment to the rule of law and fighting corruption in Bhutan, the \nlegal  framework  for  corporate  governance  could  stand  improvement  and,  most  importantly, \nstricter enforcement. The Companies Act (2000) and Prudential Regulations (2002) set forth the \nquality  of  internal  governance  and  the  guidelines  on  the  code  of  ethics  and  responsibilities  of \nboards  of  directors,  and  guidelines  on  good  corporate  governance  have  been  introduced. \nHowever, RMA, as the sole regulator of the financial sector, is not given full authority to regulate \nor  enforce  good  corporate  governance  relating  to  the  management  and  ownership  of  all \nfinancial institutions. Some directors on the boards of certain financial institutions do not meet \neven a basic fitness test for their positions. External auditors have reported some incidences of \nrelated-party \nfinancial  statements. \nFurthermore,  as  the  Government\u2019s  involvement  is  still  pervasive  in  that  Government  officials \nchair  the  boards  of  directors  in  most  financial  institutions  and  can  thus  influence  lending \ndecisions and practices, boards of directors and management do not exhibit strong commercial \norientation,  and  this  arrangement  additionally  poses  potential  conflicts  of  interest.  It  is  thus  of \nprimary  importance  to  improve  the  governance  structure  of  financial  institutions,  granting \nautonomy  and  bringing  about  a  more  commercial  orientation  to  their  operations,  and  so \nenhancing operational efficiency. \n \n24. \nAs a result of limited banking competition and strong government influence, the lending \nmarket  is  fragmented  and  price  competition  is  minimal.  BOBL  lends  mainly  to  government \nenterprises,  while  BNBL  lends  mainly  to  large  enterprises  that  meet  its  stringent  collateral \nrequirements.  BDFCL  lends  in  the  rural  and  agricultural  sectors  and  to  enterprises  using  less \nstringent security arrangements. One consequence is insufficient incentive to manage financial \ninstitutions  for  improved  performance.  For  instance,  20%  of  BOBL\u2019s  assets  (approximately \nNu6.2 billion in 2005) were not invested in creditworthy loan applications or bankable projects. \nThese  idle  funds  earn  no  interest.  The  salary  and  performance  evaluation  of  BOBL \n\nfully  disclosed \n\nin \n\n                                                 \n18  ADB. 2003. Technical Assistance to the Kingdom of Bhutan for Strengthening the Capacity of the Royal Monetary \nAuthority  and  Royal  Securities  of  Exchange  of  Bhutan  (Financed  by  the  Japan  Special  Fund).  Manila  (TA  3905-\nBHU, approved on 23 August).  \n\n19  ADB. 2005. Technical Assistance to the Kingdom of Bhutan for Preparing the Financial Sector/Non-bank Financial \n\nInstitutions Reform Program. Manila (TA 4615-BHU, approved on 17 July). \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nmanagement is not linked to operational efficiency or financial performance. BOBL\u2019s staff hiring \nis  based  on  noncommercial  considerations.  As  BOBL  accounts  for  49%  of  all  financial  sector \nassets,  large  excess  liquidity  and  operational  inefficiency  pose  considerable  concerns  for  the \nfuture  development  of  the  banking  sector.  Therefore,  improving  the  governance  structure  and \noperational  efficiency  of  BOBL,  as  part  of  the  overall  strengthening  of  corporate  governance \nregulation and promotion of banking competition, will benefit financial sector development. \n \n25. \nRICBL lends heavily in the housing sector. Its true solvency and ability to pay insurance \nclaims  on  a  timely  basis  is  questionable.  International  best  practice  restricts  the  amount  and \ntype of loan investment that insurance companies may make with their premiums and requires \nseparation  of  the  insurance  and  credit  businesses.  In  the  absence  of  insurance  regulations, \nespecially  of  a  definition  of  admissible  assets  and  reserves  required,  neither  RMA  nor  RICBL \nare  certain  of  RICBL\u2019s  true  financial  position.  Therefore,  in  line  with  the  IAIS  core  principles, \nRICBL needs to structure and separate all three businesses\u2014general insurance, life insurance, \nand credit and investment activities \u2014to address operational deficiencies as well as to comply \nwith the strengthened insurance rules and regulations, as proposed by the FSDP, adherence to \ninternational best practice.    \n \nInadequate Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Combating the Financing of \nTerrorism (CFT) Regime  \n \n\n3. \n\n26. \nFinancial  crimes  such  as  money  laundering  and  financing  terrorism  can  seriously \nthreaten the integrity and safety of financial systems. A financial system that allows proceeds of \ncrime  to  be  easily  laundered  and  concealed  will  significantly  erode  investor  confidence  and \ndivert  resources  to  less  productive  activities.  Such  erosion  of  confidence  will  have  a  negative \nimpact  on  economic  growth.  The  Government  is  aware  of  such  risks  and  has  in  place  certain \nAML/CFT  provisions  in  a  number  of  different  statutes,  such  as  in  the  Penal  Code  and  the \nNarcotics  Act  (2005).  AML/CFT  provisions  for  the  banks  are  contained  in  the  Prudential \nRegulations  (2002).  These  impose  certain  basic  requirements  for  banks  to  record  suspicious \ntransactions  and  to  adopt  customer  due  diligence  and  know-your-customer  procedures. \nHowever,  due  to  limited  understanding  of  the  provisions  and  their  impacts,  the  absence  of \ncoordination  among  government  agencies  (i.e.,  RMA,  police,  and  customs),  and  the  lack  of \neffective  reporting  and  monitoring  procedures,  there  is  no  properly  coordinated  regulatory \nframework, supervision, or effective enforcement of the AML/CFT laws. Bhutan is still vulnerable \nto having illegal funds and terrorist funding routed to the country. \n \nBesides  the  lack  of  a  comprehensive  AML/CFT  legal  framework  or  effective  regulatory \n27. \noversight of the entire financial system, Bhutan does not have any institutional arrangement to \ncollect  or  analyze  financial  data,  or  to  coordinate  with  law  enforcement  agencies.  Such  an \ninstitutional  arrangement  is  essential  for  an  effective  AML/CFT  surveillance  system.  The  need \nexists  to  further  enhance  institutional  arrangements,  regulatory  supervision,  and  relevant  staff \ntraining  to  enable  adequate  reporting  and  investigation  of  any  suspicious  transactions  and  to \nfurther facilitate timely detection and prosecution of money laundering in the financial sector.   \n \n\n4. \n\nLack of National Accounting and Auditing Policies and Standards \n\n \n28. \nBhutan does not have standard national accounting (and auditing) systems, and different \nregulatory authorities adopt different standards (e.g., the Department of Revenue and Customs \nhas one set of norms for the treatment of foreign exchange differences and RMA another set). \nAlso,  no  guideline  or  document  on  disclosure  requirements  exists  to  elaborate  international \naccounting standards (IAS) to be adopted by companies or institutions and their auditing firms in \npreparing  financial  statements.  This  creates  a  sense  of  opacity  and  lack  of  homogeneity  in \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n9\n\nstatutory financial reporting. For financial supervision reporting, there is no chart of accounts to \nbe used that meets IAS. The Government has not yet developed generally accepted accounting \nprinciples (GAAP) or generally accepted auditing standards (GAAS). In most cases, accounting \nand  auditing  professionals  are  brought  in  from  India,  and  financial  reporting  standards  have \nfollowed  Indian  GAAP  and  GAAS  practices.  National  accounting  (and  auditing)  standards  and \npolicies  are  necessary  to  ensure  comparability  of  reports,  reliability  of  information,  and \ntransparency of financial information and so promote good corporate governance in Bhutan. \n \n29. \nAuditing  standards  and  guidelines  are  fragmented.  Internal  auditing  procedures  for \nfinancial  institutions  are  set  out  in  the  Companies  Act  (2000),  Prudential  Regulations  (2002), \nand FIA (1992). The auditing issue is exacerbated by financial institutions\u2019 not always complying \nwith statutory requirements to establish an independent audit committee and internal auditors. \nFinancial institutions face difficulty hiring qualified internal auditors and chartered accountants, \nresulting in heavy dependence on foreign experts. Therefore, a unified national accounting body \nneeds  to  be  established  to  draft  Bhutanese  accounting  and  auditing  policies  and  standards  to \nbe adopted by companies and auditing firms serving Bhutan. To support the introduction of the \nnew policies and standards, it is crucial that financial sector professionals and regulators have \nsufficient  training  and  knowledge  to  effectively  adopt  new  accounting  and  auditing  standards \nand rules. \n \n\n5. \n\nInsufficient Information Disclosure  \n\n \n30. \nThe  lack  of  a  reliable  borrower  information  system  impedes  bank  lending  and  brings \nweak risk assessment. In particular, this lack of timely and reliable information often contributes \nto the build up of NPLs and the subsequent adoption of very stringent collateral requirements, \nwhich curtail the ability of the private sector to access finance. Therefore, establishing a credit \ninformation bureau (CIB) or an arrangement for banks to share credit information is fundamental \nto  improving  credit  decisions  and  accelerating  credit  growth  in  this  regard.  In  Bhutan,  sharing \ncredit  information  among  financial  institutions  is  difficult.  The  Government  has  been  keen  to \ndevelop a credit information-sharing system since 1997. However, with the very small scope of \nfinancial services then, an informal information-sharing arrangement without formal procedures \nor appropriate information technology (IT) infrastructure was recommended as sufficient for the \nbanking  sector\u2019s  level  of  development.20  Since  the  establishment  of  BNBL  in  1997  and  the \nremoval  of  the  monopoly  position  of  BOBL,  along  with  the  active  participation  of  RICBL  and \nBDFCL, lending activities and products have increased. The need is apparent to develop a CIB \nwith  an  appropriate  IT  system  for  (i)  enabling  financial  institutions  to  improve  their  credit \njudgments using the past credit experience of borrowers and knowledge regarding the incidence \nof defaults, (ii) speeding up loan applications, and (iii) facilitating the adjustment of premiums to \ncredit risk. Convenient access to the credit profiles of customers would potentially lower the cost \nof  financial  intermediation  and  ensure  a  prudent  expansion  of  the  lending  business,  thereby \nimproving enterprises\u2019 access to finance. \n \n31. \nInsufficient information disclosure also imposes serious constraints to further developing \nthe securities exchange. It is difficult to obtain up-to-date share prices for investment decisions. \nThe lack of information available on listed companies in RSEBL has impeded the efficiency of \ntransactions.  To  encourage  investors  to  enter  the  securities  market,  RSEBL  should  consider \ndeveloping a website to strengthen investor access to trading and company information. A cost-\njustified  exchange  website  can  improve  immensely  the  availability  and  timely  dissemination  of \nmarket information.  \n\n                                                 \n20 ADB.  1997.  Technical  Assistance  to  the  Kingdom  of  Bhutan  for  the  Capacity  Upgrading  of  Financial  Sector  and \n\nInfrastructure and Entrepreneurial Development. Manila (TA 2902-BHU, approved on 23 October).  \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\nGovernment Strategy \n\n \nTrading volume in the securities exchange is very limited, and the clearing, trading, and \n32. \nsettlement  system  is  therefore  very  simple.  Depository  records  are  manually  inputted  and \nreconciled  without  a  back-up  system.  Despite  the  small  trading  volume,  the  maintenance  of \ndepository  information  for  16,000  shareholders  has  become  an  issue  for  ensuring  the \ncorrectness  and  security  of  the  depository  database  that  is,  since  the  dematerialization  of \nsecurities,  the  sole  record  of  share  ownership.  A  back-up  system  is  needed  to  improve  the \nintegrity of the system. The depository system also needs to be upgraded and automated in a \nway that is cost effective, considering the current trading volume.  \n \nC. \n \n33. \nBhutan emerged from isolation and almost total dependence on subsistence agriculture \nin  the  early  1960s  with  the  initiation  of  its  first  5-year  development  plan.  Since  then,  the \nGovernment  has  formulated  various  5-year  development  plans  appropriate  to  its  stage  of \ndevelopment  to  address  the  country\u2019s  priorities  and  to  prescribe  development  strategies.  The \nrecent  Ninth  5-year  Plan  2002\u2013200721  (the  Plan),  which  was  prepared  in  line  with  the \nGovernment\u2019s  long-term  strategy  framework  (Bhutan  2020  Vision)  and  the  National  Poverty \nReduction  Strategy  2004,  clearly  reflects  the  newly  developed  objectives  and  strategies, \nincluding  promoting  private  sector  development  and  strengthening  governance.  Finance  is \nnamed in the Plan as one of the three sectors, along with infrastructure and energy, critical to \neconomic  development.  This  is  owing  to  the  role  that  financial  sector  development  plays  in \nfacilitating  private  sector  participation  in  economic  growth.  To  promote  private  sector \ndevelopment, the Plan further details and emphasizes the partnership between the financial and \nprivate  sectors  to  support  Bhutan\u2019s  move  from  subsistence  farming  to  small-scale  commercial \nagriculture and private sector activities. The Plan encourages better and greater development of \nbanking  products  and  services  as  well  as  more  competition  in  the  financial  sector.  The \nGovernment\u2019s financial sector development strategy therefore stresses the importance of having \na more efficient financial sector to tackle issues of limited access to finance, high interest rates, \nand high collateral requirements, and to support the development goals and face the challenge \nposed by narrowly based economic growth and limited private sector participation in the growth \nprocess.   \n \nD. \n \n34. \nADB  has  been  a  key  development  partner  for  Bhutan.  ADB\u2019s  country  operation \nstrategies  of  1999\u20132005  and  2006\u20132010  were  aligned  to  support  the  Government\u2019s  efforts  to \ncreate  an  enabling  environment \ninstitutional \nstrengthening of both banking and NBFIs, (ii) liberalizing foreign trade and investment regimes, \n(iii)  liberalizing  interest  rates,  and  (iv)  preparing  a  legislative  and  regulatory  framework  for  the \nfinancial sector.  \n \n35. \nADB has provided three financial sector loans to Bhutan. This first loan, in 1988, was to \nsupport the Government\u2019s efforts toward industrialization and private sector development via the \nonly  development  finance  institution,  BDFCL.  A  credit  line  design  was  incorporated  to  provide \nforeign currency funds for financing industrial projects, mainly focused on SMEs. However, the \nimpact was limited as loan funds were focused mainly on large projects instead of the intended \nSMEs.  In  1997,  ADB  started  supporting  financial  policy  reforms  with  a  sector  development \nprogram, called the Financial Sector Intermediation Facility. The Financial Sector Intermediation \nFacility  consists  of  two  loans:  one  policy  loan  and  one  development  finance  loan  (i.e., \n                                                 \n21 The Ninth 5-year Plan has been extended by 1 year to cover the period of 2002\u20132008. \n\nADB Operations and Lessons \n\nfor  private  sector  expansion \n\nthrough  (i) \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n11\n\ninvestment  loan).22  These  two  loans  were  considered  successful  in  terms  of  output  delivery \naccording  to  the  country  assistance  program  evaluation.23  The  program  completion  report24 \nfurther  states  that  the  two  loans  complemented  each  other  in  achieving  the  objectives  of \n(i) facilitating  private  sector  development  by  approving  foreign  direct  investment  policy;  (ii) \nliberalizing interest rates; (iii) improving the legal framework for the financial system and private \nbusiness;25 and (iv) improving private sector entrepreneurship, management skills, and access \nto  information  through  training  programs  held  by  the  Royal  Institute  of  Management  and  the \nEntrepreneurship Promotion Center. TA26 provided in conjunction with the two loans supported \ncapacity building in financial institutions and government agencies engaged in policy reforms.  \n \n36. \nAfter 1997, ADB\u2019s operations covered different aspects of financial sector development \nand supported a series of earlier initiatives. For instance, ADB helped convert the Unit Trust of \nBhutan  into  BNBL,  a  new  commercial  bank,27  and  assisted  in  restructuring  the  Government \nEmployees Provident Fund (footnote 14), establishing and upgrading a payment and settlement \nsystem28  and  strengthening  institutional  capacity  in  the  Department  of  Aid  and  Debt \nManagement of the Ministry of Finance29 (MOF) and in RMA.30 This body of TA made notable \nprogress in continuing the development agenda in the financial system. However, some of the \nTA mentioned above had mixed results. For instance, assistance to strengthen the supervisory \nfunctioning of RMA by  drafting necessary laws and regulations has had limited impact, as the \ndraft  laws  and  regulations\u2014including  the  draft  FSA,  draft  Insurance  and  Securities  Exchange \nRegulations,  and  draft  Pension  Act\u2014have  not  yet  been  enacted  for  lack  of  sufficient \nconsultation, understanding of the law provisions, and relevant technical training. \n \n37. \nTA  provision  in  Bhutan  has  produced  two  key  lessons.  One  is  that  previous  TA  for \ninstitutional development and policy reforms was implemented in relatively short periods and in \na compartmentalized way. Drafting legislation should be accompanied by sufficient consultation \nand  capacity  building  to  ensure  implementation  and  compliance  with  sufficient  technical \nknowledge.  Capacity  building  should  also  be  provided  to  all  relevant  stakeholders  (i.e.,  both \nregulatory  and  in  key  financial  institutions)  to  ensure  the  sustainability  of  policy  reforms.

A  program  loan \nmodality would be more appropriate to allow the integration of the process of drafting legislation \nwith  the  necessary  consultation  and  technical  training,  to  achieve  the  expected  policy  reform \noutcomes.  Sufficient  stakeholder  consultations  of  new  laws  and  regulations  and  technical \ntraining can also enhance regulators\u2019 understanding of the provisions as well as ensure that the \nlaws  are  tailored  to  the  country  context  and  that  there  is  adequate  implementation.  Second, \nBhutan  has  an  urgent  need  for  institutional  capacity  building  at  its  current  stage  of  financial \ndevelopment. Knowledge transfer on best international practices, provided on an on-going basis \nto  deal  with  new  market  developments,  is  essential  for  successful  and  sustainable  financial \nsector development. In line with the two key lessons learned from recent TA implementation, the \nFSDP  design  has  adopted  a  comprehensive  approach  to  ensure  the  relevant  rules  and \nregulations are drafted with sufficient consultation. The FSDP also has been integrated with a \nproject focusing on institutional strengthening of the regulator and other stakeholders to ensure \nthe sustainability of policy reforms proposed by the program.  \n \nE. \n \n38. \nADB has closely coordinated with Bhutan\u2019s other development partners in designing the \nFSDP.  Frequent  dialogue  was  conducted  to  maximize  synergies  where  possible  and  to  avoid \nduplication.  UNDP  cooperated  with  Netherlands  Development  Organization  (SNV)  to  provide \nbusiness development services and financing in rural areas, including carrying out a pilot mobile \nbanking  scheme  as  a  means  to  encourage  rural  savings  and  strengthen  financing  for  rural \nenterprises.  The  rural  enterprises  development  program  was  completed  in  early  2006.  SNV  is \ncurrently  continuing  advisory  assistance  in  regional  trade  and  industry  offices.  UNDP  is \nassisting  the  Government  in  finalizing  the  draft  Pension  Act  and  conducting  stakeholder \nconsultation  workshops  for  enhancing  pension  regulations.  The  South  Asia  Enterprise \nDevelopment  Facility  (SEDF),  established  by  the  International  Finance  Corporation  and  the \nWorld Bank, will support capacity building in BOBL and BNBL to improve the quality of their loan \nportfolios  and  their  ability  to  introduce  new  products  and  prepare  new  business  and  human \nresources  strategies.  The  support  from  SEDF  is  in  line  with  the  objective  of  the  FSDP  to \nimprove the operations of banks and will be able to further augment the impacts of the FSDP \ntoward  improving  the  structure  of  financial  institutions  and  the  efficiency  of  financial \nintermediation.  \n \n39. \nThe  World  Bank  provided,  in  line  with  its  2006\u20132009  country  assistance  strategy,  a \nmulti-sectoral development policy grant for $15 million, supporting improvement in public budget \nand financial management, promoting private sector development (via an improved investment \nclimate), and expanding access to better education and healthcare. Currently, the World Bank is \nreviewing the Companies Act 2000 to strengthen the companies\u2019 regulations for private sector \ndevelopment.  ADB  has  exchanged  program  information  in  relation  to  the  proposed  new \nlegislation to ensure consistency between proposed changes to the Companies Act and FSA.  \n \n40. \nThe  International  Monetary  Fund  (IMF)  in  2005  provided  RMA  with  several  technical \ntraining  courses  toward  upgrading  statistical  systems  and  procedures,  particularly  in  the \nmonitoring  of  money  and  banking,  and  external  sectors,  and  enhancing  the  internal  audit  and \nmanagement  of  RMA.  More  recently,  IMF  provided  TA  on  a  study  of  financial  market \ndevelopment in Bhutan. The priority of financial sector development in Bhutan, as identified in \nthe  IMF  report,  is  consistent  with  policy  reforms  recommended  in  the  FSDP,  especially \nregarding strengthened legislation and regulation for insurance and the securities exchange. To \navoid  duplication  and  ensure  resources  are  allocated  in  complementary  areas,  ADB  and  IMF \nare closely coordinating the FSDP policy reforms with IMF\u2019s upcoming TA program. In addition, \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n13\n\nIMF has been closely consulted and has provided comments on the revised RMA Act and draft \nFSA.  These  comments  have  been  duly  incorporated  in  the  proposed  acts.  The  development \ncoordination matrix is in Appendix 2.  \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED SECTOR DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM \n\n \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nA. \n \n41. \nThe  FSDP  consists  of  a  program  loan  and  a  project  loan.  The  program  loan  includes \ncrucial  policy  reforms,  and  the  project  loan  will  provide  direct  assistance  to  facilitate  FSDP \nimplementation and ensure the smooth implementation and sustainability of the policy reforms \nunder the program. It is envisaged that the FSDP will have a positive impact on establishing an \nenvironment more conducive to business investment and stimulating the development of a more \nactive private sector. The outcome of the FSDP is improved depth, soundness, and stability of \nthe  financial  system  by  strengthening  the  governance  of  the  whole  financial  system  and \nimproving the efficiency of financial intermediation. \n \nB. \n \n42. \nThere  are  two  important  features  of  the  FSDP.  First,  it  offers  a  comprehensive  and \nintegrated approach to financial sector development, applying lessons from earlier TA to move \naway  from  an  uncoordinated  and  compartmentalized  approach.  Second,  the  design  of  the \nFSDP  supports  training  schemes  to  ensure  the  successful  implementation  of  program \ncomponents  as  well  to  create  a  pool  of  Bhutanese  professionals  in  accounting,  auditing,  and \ninsurance underwriting and thereby improving self-reliance in these areas.    \n \nC. \n \n\nImportant Features \n\nThe Program Loan \n\n1. \n\nObjectives \n\n \n43. \nThe  FSDP  objective  is  to  enhance  governance  of  the  financial  sector  as  a  whole.  To \nachieve  this  goal,  the  program  will  seek  to  (i)  improve  the  legal,  regulatory  and  supervisory \nframework  of  the  financial  sector,  in  particular  with  the  passage  of  the  revised  RMA  Act  and \nFSA;  (ii) enhance  corporate  governance  that  promotes  more  commercially  oriented  financial \ninstitutions,  in  particular  by  enhancing  the  legal  framework,  operations  of  BOBL,  and \norganizational  structure  of  RICBL;  (iii)  establish  an  AML/CFT  surveillance  system  for  the \nfinancial sector; (iv) develop national accounting and auditing policies and standards for reliable \nfinancial reporting; and (v) establish an appropriate CIB to improve credit decisions.  \n \n\n2. \n\nComponents and Outputs \n\n \n44. \nThe program consists of five components. The outputs and performance targets of the \nprogram  are  spelled  out  in  the  design  and  monitoring  framework  in  Appendix  3.  The \ndevelopment policy letter and policy matrix are included in Appendix 4. \n\n \na. \n\nImprove the Regulation and Supervision of the Financial Sector \n\n \n45. \nAs  a  first  step  to  ensure  a  strong  reform  regime,  a  revised  RMA  Act  will  need  to  be \ndrafted and finalized to give RMA autonomy to act with independence on monetary matters and \nvest  it  with  enhanced  powers  to  oversee  the  operations  of  the  entire  financial  system.  In  the \nabsence of an IMF program to support it, the FSDP should continue its support toward ensuring \nthe  finalization  and  passage  of  the  revised  RMA  Act,  which  has  been  finalized  with  ADB \n\n \n\n\f14 \n\n \n\nassistance (footnote 18) and is currently undergoing translation for submission to the National \nAssembly.  The  program  will  therefore  ensure  that  the  revised  RMA  Act  is  submitted  and \nenacted. Under the revised RMA Act, a cap will be placed on the amount that the Government \ncan borrow from RMA on a non-revolving basis for a term not exceeding 3 months. Further, the \ncorporate  governance  structure  will  be  converted  into  a  two-tier  structure,  giving  RMA \nmanagement  greater  control  over  RMA  policy  and  operations.  It  will  be  composed  of  a \nrestructured board and an executive committee. The current board, comprising the minister of \nfinance  (acting  as  chairman),  secretary  of  finance,  managing  director  of  RMA,  and  two  other \nappointed directors (one from MOF and one from the Ministry of Trade and Industry)\u2014all from \nthe  public  sector\u2014is  being  replaced  with  one  comprising,  firstly,  the  governor,  two  deputy \ngovernors,  and  four  directors  appointed  by  the  Government  from  outside  RMA.  The  executive \ncommittee will comprise the governor (heretofore called the managing director) and two deputy \ngovernors. Moreover, the governor and members of the board are now barred from serving as \nemployees, shareholders, or board members of financial service providers during their tenure of \noffice,  and  from  being  associated  with  them  in  any  way.  These  steps  are  in  line  with  the \nGovernment\u2019s  preference  to  proceed  in  measured  steps  towards  the  institution  of  a  fully \nindependent central bank.       \n \n46. \nSecondly, the need is pressing for the draft FSA to be finalized and enacted to address \ngaps in the regulation and supervision of the whole financial sector of Bhutan. The small size of \nBhutan\u2019s economy makes it appropriate to have RMA as the single regulator. Therefore, under \nthe  FSA,  RMA  is  to  be  vested  with  powers  to  license,  regulate,  and  supervise  all  financial \nservice  providers  throughout  the  country.  The  draft  FSA  is  currently  under  review  under  ADB \nassistance (footnote 19), and the remaining gaps in legislation and regulation for such sectors \nas  insurance  and  securities  exchange  are  to  be  amended  in  the  final  FSA  to  ensure  that  the \nFSA  is  comprehensive  and  coherent.  In  particular,  RMA  will  be  provided  with  powers  to  (i) \nconduct on-site inspections in the whole financial sector; (ii) license, regulate, and supervise the \ninsurance  sector  as  a  separate  entity;  (iii)  act  as  the  securities  regulator  to  investigate  and \nprosecute  securities  violations  for  both  licensed  and  non-licensed  companies;  (iv)  issue  rules \nand  guidelines  on  corporate  governance  matters  (see  point  [b]  below);  and  (v) deal  with \nAML/CFT issues (see point [c] below). Prudential regulations on banking supervision, insurance \nregulations,  and  securities  exchange  will  be  revised,  updated,  and  further  strengthened  to \nensure adequate regulation and supervision in the relevant sectors. Furthermore, the FSDP will \nsupport  setting  up  a  standard  chart  of  accounts  to  be  followed  by  all  financial  institutions  and \ntheir external auditors. It will also help draft appropriate licensing requirements and procedures \nfor new entrants in the banking and insurance sectors to ensure and encourage fair competition \nin all financial subsectors.  \n \n\nb. \n\nImprove  the  Corporate  Governance  Structure  and  Operations  of \nFinancial Institutions \n\n \n47. \nThe  FSDP  will  consider  all-pervasive  issues  of  corporate  governance  in  the  financial \nsector by strengthening the legal framework to include matters relating to corporate governance, \nimproving the operations of BOBL and clarifying the organizational structure of RICBL. The FSA \nwill provide RMA with comprehensive powers to regulate and enforce corporate governance for \nthe  whole  financial  sector.  The  provisions  on  corporate  governance  will  include,  among  other \nstipulations,  (i)  an  appropriate  fit-and-proper  test  for  boards  of  directors;  (ii)  private  sector \nrepresentation in the structure and composition of the boards of directors; (iii) conflict-of-interest \nrules; and (iv) restrictions on cross shareholdings.  \n \n48. \nThe  corporate  governance  legal  framework  will  provide  autonomy  for  public  sector \nfinancial institutions and ensure the commercial orientation of their operations. A memorandum \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n15\n\nof understanding will be prepared and signed between MOF and the board of directors of BOBL \nto provide time-bound institutional performance targets and autonomy for its operations. In turn, \nmanagement  of  BOBL  will  prepare  a  rolling  business  plan  that  will  define  the  parameters  and \nperformance indicators that management of BOBL will deliver to allow the board of directors to \nmeet their commitment under the memorandum of understanding with MOF. The business plan \nwill  provide  for  expanding  its  lending  operations  and  determining  how  best  to  deal  with  its \nexisting  excess  liquidity,  linking  remuneration  for  management  and  the  board  of  directors  to \nperformance, improving recruitment and performance evaluations, and developing a strategy for \nhuman  resources.  Management  of  BOBL  will  be  recruited  under  clear,  objective,  and  fair \nrecruitment  guidelines  and  procedures  to  ensure  improvement  in  operational  efficiency  and \nfinancial  performance.  RMA,  as  regulator,  will  be  informed  of  all  discussions  and  agreements \nbetween the Government and BOBL. \n \nIt  is  important  to  improve  the  organizational  structure  of  RICBL  according  to  insurance \n49. \ncore principles of IAIS, which require complete separation of life insurance, other insurance, and \nany  other  financial  services.  RICBL  will  prepare  a  rationalization  plan  detailing  the  necessary \nsteps  to  separate  its  business  operations.  RICBL  will  also  prepare  a  business  plan  post-\nrationalization  to  ensure  the  phased-in  segregation  of  business  units,  adequate  solvency \nprovisioning,  and  capital  adequacy.  A  successful  segregation  of  financial  assets  according  to \ndifferent operations can improve the matching and reserving system for assets and liabilities to \nensure the provision of adequate solvency margins. \n\n \nEstablish an Effective AML and CFT Regime \n\nc. \n\n \nThe  program  loan  will  support  the  Government\u2019s  initiatives  to  establish  an  effective \n50. \nAML/CFT  regime.  The  AML/CFT  component  of  the  program  aims  to  strengthen  the  AML/CFT \npolicies and procedures currently employed in  Bhutan. This will include (i) updating legislation \n(i.e.,  the  proposed  FSA)  to  establish  RMA  as  the  AML/CFT  regulator  and  supervisor  for  all \nfinancial  institutions;  (ii)  RMA  drafting  and  issuing  regulations  requiring  financial  institutions  to \nestablish  procedures  for  know-your-customer  processes,  generating  reports  on  suspicious \ntransactions, and reporting them to RMA; and (iii) RMA establishing a financial intelligence unit \n(FIU) whose function will be to gather information on suspected money laundering or financing \nof terrorism and liaise with law enforcement agencies. The enhanced AML/CFT framework is in \nline with the Government\u2019s Good Governance Plus Strategy (2005). \n \n\nd. \n\nDevelop National Accounting and Auditing Policies and Standards \n\n \n51. \nThe program loan will address the high degree of opacity and incomparability of reports \nand  performance  records  of  financial  institutions  by  developing  and  applying  uniform  and \nconsistent  national  accounting  and  auditing  standards.  It  will  support  the  development  of  the \nnational accounting and auditing standards to form the Bhutanese GAAP, in line with IAS where \napplicable,  and  the  GAAS  in  line  with  international  auditing  standards.  The  FSDP  envisages \ncreating the Bhutanese accounting and auditing standards board (AASB), which will be tasked \nwith  developing  the  Bhutanese  GAAP  and  GAAS.  MOF  will  form  an  accounting  and  auditing \nstandards committee, which will develop the plan to establish AASB. Comprising the accounting \nand  auditing  standards  committee  will  be  representatives  of  the  private  sector,  MOF,  Royal \nAudit  Authority  (RAA),  RMA,  and  Ministry  of  Trade  and  Industry.  AASB  will  also  have  the \nauthority  to  regulate  and  supervise  the  accounting  and  auditing  profession.  Of  paramount \nimportance  is  that  the  Government  initiates  a  training  program  to  develop  the  accounting  and \nauditing profession in Bhutan. \n \n \n\n \n\n\f16 \n\n \n\n \ne. \n\nStrengthen Credit Information Disclosure  \n\n \n52. \nA reliable system for sharing credit information among lending institutions can expedite \nloan  applications  and  improve  credit  risk  assessment.  It  would  potentially  lower  the  cost  of \nborrowing and facilitate financial transactions. The program loan will support establishing a CIB \nwith the aim of improving the quality of financial institutions\u2019 credit risk assessment. It will help \nthe  Government  set  up  a  CIB  unit  at  RMA,  which  will  prepare  an  implementation  plan  in \nconsultation with major stakeholders. The CIB unit will be responsible for the institutional set-up \nand legal and regulatory framework for its full operation. CIB establishment will be based on the \nfindings  of  the  feasibility  study31  on  appropriate  arrangements  for  data  collection,  system \nmaintenance, and information sharing.  \n \n \n \n53. \nThe  program  loan  will  support  strengthening  the  overall  governance  of  the  financial \nsystem  through  an  improved  legal,  regulatory,  and  supervisory  framework  for  all  financial \nservices  and  institutions.  The  FSDP  comprehensively  addresses  the  governance  issue.  The \nclose coordination and integration of proposed recommendations is the important feature of the \nprogram,  which  is  highly  consistent  with  the  Government-approved  Good  Governance  Plus \nStrategy (2005) for achieving transparency, accountability, and efficiency in the whole financial \nsystem and so advance private sector and economic development. \n \n\nImportant Features \n\n3. \n\n4. \n\nFinancing Plan \n\n \n54. \nIt is proposed that ADB support the Government\u2019s policy reform program by providing a \nprogram  loan  of  Special  Drawing  Rights  (SDR)7,472,000  ($11  million  equivalent)  from  ADB\u2019s \nSpecial Funds resources. The borrower will be the Government. The program loan will have a \nfixed term of 24 years, including a grace period of 8 years. The interest charge will be 1.0% per \nannum  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5%  per  annum  thereafter.  Program  loan  proceeds  are \nexpected to be utilized over a period of 36 months from the date of loan effectiveness. \n \nThe  estimated  adjustment  costs  of  policy  reforms  under  the  FSDP  are  based  on \n55. \nmedium-term adjustment costs. The tentative estimated adjustment cost is approximately $16.5 \nmillion, which includes the following:  \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nFinancial  regulation  and  supervision.  The  estimated  cost  is  $6  million,  of \nwhich  $4  million  will  be  borne  by  the  financial  institutions,  arising  from \nadjustments  for  implementing  the  new  regulations  and  adjustments  to  the  NPL \nprovision  following  a  new  schedule  of  loan  classification  that  follows  more \nstringent \ninternational  standards,  and  $2  million  will  support  RMA\u2019s  \nimplementation of laws and regulations and, among others, for additional staffing, \nstakeholder  consultations,  downstream  training,  administration,  supervision \ncosts, etc. \nCorporate  governance.  The  cost  is  $3  million.  The  additional  costs  will  arise \nfrom implementing corporate governance rules such as introducing private sector \nrepresentatives on boards, preparing and implementing business plans for BOBL \nand  RICBL,  preparing  human  resources  strategies,  strengthening  performance \nevaluation, and conducting stakeholder workshops.  \n\n                                                 \n31 RMA has prepared a feasibility study for establishing a CIB with assistance from Dun & Bradstreet SAME Ltd. The \ndraft  report  was  furnished  to  ADB.  The  study  recommends  the  required  software,  operational  model,  and  legal \nframework to establish and govern the CIB. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n17\n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nAML/CFT. The estimated cost of establishing and maintaining an FIU in RMA is \n$2 million. \nAASB. The cost of establishing and operating AASB and developing Bhutanese \nGAAP  and  GAAS,  including  market  consultations,  amending  local  legislation, \ndrafting  accounting  and  auditing  provisions,  and  implementation,  is  about  $4 \nmillion. \nCIB. The cost of establishing a CIB and relevant legislation for its functioning and \ngovernance is $1.5 million, as estimated under the study commissioned by RMA.  \n\n \n\n  \n\n5. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\na. \n\n \nProgram Management \n \n\n56.  MOF  will  set  up  an  inter-agency  program  steering  committee  (PSC)  headed  by  the \nsecretary of MOF and comprising, among others, representatives of RMA, BOBL, RICBL, and \nRSEBL  to  monitor  progress,  coordinate  implementation,  and  ensure  effective  fulfillment  of  the \nproposed policy reforms. The PSC will meet every quarter or as often as needed. It will provide \nADB,  for  reference,  all  reports  and  minutes  of  PSC  meetings,  and  ADB  may  attend  these \nmeetings as an observer. A program and project organization chart is in Appendix 5.  \n \n57.  MOF will be the executing agency (EA) for the program loan and will be responsible for \ncoordinating  with  the  ministries  and  agencies  concerned  on  the  policy  reforms.  MOF  will \nestablish  a  program  and  project  management  unit  (PMU)  headed  by  a  program  director,  who \nshall  be  a  senior  staff  of  RMA,  responsible  for  program  and  project  administration,  loan \ndisbursement,  accounts  maintenance,  and  reporting  to  the  PSC.  The  program  director  will  be \nassisted by representatives of respective divisions at RMA and MOF\u2019s Department of Aid and \nDebt  Management.  One  of  the  representatives  will  be  designated  as  an  alternate  program \ndirector. \n \n58.  MOF will be the implementing agency (IA) for two components: (i) improving corporate \ngovernance and (ii) developing accounting and auditing standards. RMA will be the IA for three \ncomponents:  (i)  improving  financial  regulation  and  supervision,  (ii)  establishing  an  AML/CFT \nframework, and (iii) a CIB. \n \n\nThe  FSDP  will  be  completed  by  end  of  December  2009,  in  line  with  the  indicative \n\nb. \n\nPeriod of Implementation \n\n \n59. \nimplementation schedule in Appendix 6. \n \n\nc. \n\nProcurement and Disbursement \n \n\n60. \nProgram  loan  proceeds  will  be  used  to  finance  the  foreign  exchange  cost  of  items \nproduced  and  procured  in  ADB  member  countries,  other  than  items  specified  in  the  list  of \nineligible items (Appendix 7) or imports financed by other bilateral and multilateral sources. All \nprocurement  under  the  program  loan  will  be  undertaken  through  normal  commercial  practices \nfor  the  private  sector  or  the  Government\u2019s  prescribed  procurement  procedures  acceptable  to \nADB,  with  due  consideration  to  economy  and  efficiency.  The  Government  will  certify  that  the \nvolume of eligible imports exceeds the amount of ADB\u2019s projected disbursement under the loan \nfor  the  given  period.  The  disbursement  of  the  program  loan  will  be  in  accordance  with \nSimplification  of  Disbursement  Procedures  and  Related  Requirements  for  Program  Loans \n(1998).  ADB  reserves  the  right  to  audit  the  use  of  program  loan  proceeds  and  verify  the \naccuracy of the Government\u2019s certification.  \n\n \n\n\f18 \n\n \n\nd. \n\nFinancial Management \n\n \n61. \nTo  ensure  proper  fund  management,  a  detailed  financial  management  assessment, \nincluding  the  use  of  financial  management  assessment  questionnaires,  reviewed  the  financial \nmanagement arrangements of the EA and IA (Supplementary Appendix B). The summary of the \nfindings is in Appendix  8. The Government has a computerized financial management system \nthat  produces  satisfactory  financial  reports  and  ensures  the  confidentiality,  integrity,  and \navailability of the data. All financial statements are subject to audit by RAA within 6 to 9 months \nof  fiscal  year  closure.  The  external  audit  conducted  by  RAA  follows  the  International \nOrganization  of  Supreme  Audit  Institution\u2019s  auditing  standards,  which  are  in  line  with  the \nInternational  Standards  on  Auditing  issued  by  the  International  Federation  of  Accountants. \nFinancial management arrangements are found to be satisfactory in general.  \n \n62. \nInternal audits have been established in all ministries and RMA. The Financial Rules and \nRegulations (2001) manual contains a section on internal controls, explaining their nature and \nobjectives.  The  manual  provides  simple  advice  on  managers\u2019  responsibilities  for  internal \ncontrols  and  identifies  some  of  the  main  areas  where  they  are  needed.  However,  the  internal \nauditors in RMA and MOF do not hold recognized professional qualifications such as chartered \npublic  accountant.  Their  qualifications  are  based  on  experience  and  ad  hoc  courses  (auditing \nseminars, etc.). As further improving the awareness and specialized training in accounting and \nauditing for better internal controls and financial management is required, the FSDP will help the \nGovernment  strengthen  financial  management  by  enhancing  skills  and  qualifications  in \naccounting  and  auditing,  as  well  as  developing  national  accounting  and  auditing  policies  and \nstandards. \n  \n\ne. \n\nMonitoring and Tranching \n\n \n63. \nADB will monitor FSDP implementation through 6 monthly review and periodic progress \nreports and will field regular missions to confirm fulfillment of policy actions for tranche release \nand advise on actions to maintain implementation within the program period.   \n \n64. \nThe FSDP will be for 3 years. The program loan will be released in three tranches. The \nfirst  tranche  (not  exceeding  $4  million  equivalent)  is  to  be  disbursed  upon  loan  effectiveness, \nsubject to the Government\u2019s compliance with all first tranche requirements. The second tranche \n(not  exceeding  $4  million  equivalent)  will  be  disbursed  18  months  after  loan  effectiveness, \nsubject  to  satisfactory  fulfillment  of  the  corresponding  tranche  release  conditions.  The  third \ntranche ($3 million equivalent) will be disbursed 18 months after the second tranche, subject to \nthe  satisfactory  fulfillment  of  the  corresponding  tranche  release  conditions.  The  policy  matrix \nlists all the tranche release conditions. \n\nf. \n\n \nCounterpart Funds \n \n\nThe Government will ensure the local currency funds generated by the program loan will \n\n65. \nbe used to support the adjustment cost of reforms under the FSDP.  \n \n\ng. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n \n66. \nAn audit of the use of the loan proceeds will be undertaken if requested by ADB. ADB \nretains the right to (i) audit any account and (ii) verify the validity of the certification issued by \nthe Government for each withdrawal application. Prior to withdrawal, the Government will open \nan  account  at  RMA  to  receive  all  loan  proceeds.  The  account  will  be  established,  managed, \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n19\n\noperated,  and  liquidated  in  accordance  with  terms  satisfactory  to  ADB.  The  PMU  will  send  6 \nmonthly progress reports to the Government and ADB on policy and institutional reforms. The \nprogress report will describe progress made and any changes to the implementation schedule \nand identifies any problems encountered and remedial actions taken.  \n \n\nh. \n\nProgram Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n \n67. \nThe PMU will establish and maintain a system to monitor program performance that will \ninclude  a  database  on  the  status  of  policy  measures  and  program  indicators,  based  on  the \npolicy matrix and the design and monitoring framework.  \n\n \nProgram Review \n\ni. \n\n \nADB will conduct a comprehensive review 3 months prior to the end of both the second \n68. \ntranche  and  the  third  tranche.  A  program  completion  review  at  the  end  of  the  FSDP  will  be \nconducted  to  evaluate  its  overall  impact  on  the  financial  sector  and  the  achievement  of  its \ndesired objectives, as well as other benefits, intended or not, particularly for the poor. \n \nD. \n \n\nThe Project Loan \n\n1. \n\nObjectives \n\n \n69. \nThe  purpose  of  the  project  loan  is  to  facilitate  the  implementation  of  the  FSDP  and  to \nensure  smooth  implementation  of  the  policy  reforms  under  the  program.  The  project  loan  will \nsupport  the  institutional  development  and  strengthening  of  key  institutions  through  capacity \nbuilding,  development  of  an  adequate  AML/CFT  regulatory  framework,  improved  accounting \nand  auditing  practices,  support  of  CIB  establishment,  and  improved  securities  information \ndisclosure.  \n \n\n2. \n\nComponents and Outputs \n\n \n\na. \n\nBuilding Sector Capacity \n\n \n \n \n70. \nThe  project  loan  will  support  filling  in  gaps  in  present  capacity  in  the  financial  sector, \nproviding practical on-the-job training for the regulator and supervisor and selected key financial \ninstitutions  with  a  view  toward  assuring  smooth  implementation  of  the  new  regime.  The \ncapacity-building schemes will be reinforced by employee incentives and retention measures to \nensure the dissemination and maintenance of the training knowledge as well as to compensate \nfor  the  training  cost  by  providing  a  certain  period  of  post-training  service  time.  The  retention \nmeasures  will  combine  reward  and  prevention,  as  staff  will  be  (i)  rewarded  by  incorporating \ntraining  in  their  performance  evaluation  for  possible  career  advancement  and  greater \nsupervisory  or  management  responsibility  and  (ii)  discouraged  from  leaving  RMA  or  financial \ninstitutions after completing training by a lock-in clause in their employment contracts requiring \nthat early leavers compensate the Government for the cost of training on a pro-rata basis. \n \n\nProgram \n\nfor \n\nStrengthening \n\nFinancial \n\ni.  \n\nSecondment \nSupervision   \n\n \nTo obtain skills and practical experience in the on-site supervision of banks and NBFIs, \n71. \nthe  project  loan  will  support  a  program  for  FISD  staff  of  RMA  to  be  seconded  to  a  member \ncountry  with  strong  financial  regulatory  and  supervisory  bodies.  The  secondment  program  for \n\n \n\n\f20 \n\n \n\nimproving  the  performance  of  FISD\u2019s  staff  is  intended  to  last,  on  an  intermittent  basis,  for  the \nwhole  FSDP  implementation  period.  Four  senior  FISD  staff  for  each  supervision  area  (i.e., \nbanks,  development  finance,  insurance,  and  possibly  the  securities  market)  will  go  on \nsecondment for a minimum of 3 months each year. After returning from secondment, the trained \nstaff will share their practical experience with colleagues by (i) giving short training sessions, (ii) \ncreating  a  supervision  materials  library  to  be  regularly  updated,  and  (iii)  helping  the  chief  of \nFISD to update the supervision manuals with lessons learned during secondment.  \n \n\nii.  \n\nTraining Program for Enhancing Accounting and Auditing  \n\n \n72. \nThe project loan will support a training program for two RMA staff to obtain professional \nqualifications  in  accounting  and  auditing  (e.g.,  chartered  accountancy  from  the  Institute  of \nChartered Accountants in England and Wales). The staff will train in a country within the region \nso  that,  at  the  end  of  the  3-year  accountancy  training  program,  RMA  should  have  in-house \naccountants to enhance its supervisory role. \n \n\niii.  \n\nTraining  Program  for  Enhancing  Insurance  Underwriting \nSkills \n\n \n73. \nThe  project  loan  will  support  a  staff  training  program  with  insurance  companies  in \nmember  countries  with  a  more  advanced  and  well-regulated  insurance  sector  to  develop  in-\nhouse skills in insurance underwriting and claims adjustment. This will reduce RICBL\u2019s reliance \non foreign consultants in key areas of the insurance business. Experienced RICBL officers will \njoin the regular staff of the host company to carry out day-to-day tasks and so receive valuable \non-the-job  training  in  underwriting  for  general  insurance  (fire,  motor,  engineering  and  marine, \nand  aviation  transport),  life  insurance,  and  claims  processing.  In  each  year,  six  different  and \nrelevant employees will go on secondment for a minimum of 6 months each year during the 3 \nyears of program implementation. \n \n\niv. \n\nCapacity Building for Securities Exchange  \n\n \n74. \nThe project loan will provide on-the-job training to increase securities-trained personnel \nin  FISD  and  RSEBL.  The  capacity-building  program  will  cover  (i)  supervision  processes;  (ii) \nlistings  and  delistings;  (iii)  trading  modalities;  (iv)  settlements,  payments,  and  depository \noperations; (v) governance, covering disclosure and conflicts of interest, etc.; and (vi) the new \nregulatory  framework.  The  specialized  training  will  enhance  the  monitoring,  surveillance,  and \nsupervision  of  the  securities  market  and  brokers  as  well  as  strengthen  the  operations  of  the \nsecurities  exchange.  An  international  capital markets  specialist  will  be  recruited  to  provide  the \ntraining. \n \n\nImproving Corporate Governance \n\nv. \n \n\n75. \nThe project loan will help draft regulations to provide for and internalize good corporate \ngovernance measures. It will also assist institutions to carry out these proposed measures and \neffect  appropriate  organizational  changes,  such  as  fit-and-proper  tests  for  boards  of  directors, \nenhancing  the  structure  and  composition  of  boards,  conflict-of-interest  rules,  restrictions  on \ncross  shareholding,  and  others  measures  as  appropriate.  An  international  legal  expert  will  be \nrecruited to undertake the improvements in corporate governance, assisted by a national legal \nexpert. \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n21\n\nb. \n\nDeveloping AML/CFT Framework \n\n \n76. \nThe  project  loan  will  support  the  institutional  development  of  an  FIU  in  RMA.  This \nsupport  will  include  (i)  FIU\u2019s  organizational  design,  (ii)  operating  procedures  including  off-  and \non-site  supervision  for  AML/CFT  issues,  (iii)  management  of  FIU  during  initial  stages  prior  to \nhandover  to  FIU  staff,  and  (iv)  the establishment  of  the  FIU  including procurement  of  basic IT \ninfrastructure.  Assistance  will  also  cover  associated  on-the-job  training  for  RMA,  police, \nprosecutors,  and  judges  regarding  (i)  the  effects  of  AML  on  economic  development  and \ninternational  standards,  (ii)  the  legal  requirements  to  meet  international  standards,  (iii)  the \nregulatory  and  institutional  requirements,  (iv)  the  compliance  requirements  for  financial \ninstitutions,  (v)  building  an  effective  FIU,  (vi)  domestic  (interagency)  and  international \ncooperation, (vii) CFT, and (viii) investigating money laundering and terror financing. In addition, \nthis  component  will  promote  compliance  with  the  new  AML/CFT  regulations  and  reporting \nrequirements  by  providing  informational  seminars  for  financial  intermediaries.  This  will  be \nprovided by an international AML/CFT expert, assisted by a national legal specialist. \n\n \nc. \n\n \ne. \n\n \n\nImproving Accounting and Auditing Practices \n\n \n \n77. \nThe  project  loan  will  support  the  recruitment  of  an  international  financial  sector \naccounting  and  auditing  firm  to  (i)  help  the  accounting  and  auditing  reform  committee  (to  be \nestablished  by  the  Government)  develop  a  roadmap  for  starting  up  and  developing  AASB, \n(ii) help  AASB  develop  the  Bhutanese  GAAP  and  GAAS  in  line  with  IAS,  and  (iii)  update \nfinancial  reporting  formats.  In  addition,  this  component  will  promote  compliance  with  the  new \nGAAP and GAAS by providing progress seminars for financial intermediaries, practitioners and \nprofessionals, affected parties, and the private sector. \n \n \n \nTo  help  the  Government  establish  a  CIB  and  ensure  the  selection  and  start-up  of  an \n78. \noperational model suitable to the country, the project will recruit a CIB expert to (i) design and \nplan the establishment of CIB in line with the CIB feasibility study,32 (ii) carry out procurement \nactivities  for  establishing  CIB  including  determination  of  appropriate  powers  to  be  vested  in \nRMA  and/or  CIB  for  carrying  out  its  functions,  and  (iii)  help  operationalize  CIB  and  do  pilot \ntesting. \n\nSupporting CIB Establishment \n\nd. \n\n \n\nImproving Securities Information Disclosure \n\n \n79. \nThe bedrock of securities regulation is the timely disclosure of material information. To \nimprove  it,  RSEBL  needs  to  upgrade  its  equipment  and  software  so  it  can  retain  copies  of \nreports  published  by  listed  companies  and  upgrade  the  inventory  of  securities  ownership  for \nmarket disclosure. The project loan will support (i) developing a well-designed website to ensure \nproper  information  disclosure  for  RSEBL  and  (ii)  upgrading  and  automating  the  database  for \nRSEBL  to  improve  depository  information.  The  developed  website  will  serve  to  (i)  collect  and \ndisseminate  information  about  the  market,  listed  companies,  and  brokers  and  (ii)  help  raise \nawareness of and interest in the securities market. The upgraded and automated database will \nhelp RSEBL enhance internal controls and inspections for the depository. Assistance will cover \nassociated training for RSEBL and brokers on the use and maintenance of the website.  \n \n \n \n                                                 \n32 See footnote 31.  \n\n \n\n\f22 \n\n \n\n3. \n\nImportant Features \n\n \n80. \nThe project loan will focus on strengthening key institutions for delivering the key facets \nof the FSDP, leading to more effective regulation and supervision and improved governance. In \nparticular, the features of this project loan are (i) continuous development of supervisory skills \nthat will ensure proper implementation of the regulations and up-to-date knowledge for dealing \nwith new market situations; (ii) the creation of a pool of Bhutanese professionals in accounting, \nauditing,  and  insurance  underwriting,  thereby  reducing  reliance  on  foreign  consultants;  (iii) \nimproved  job  skills  for  financial  institutions  staff;  and  (iv)  improved  financial  information \ndisclosure.  \n\n \nCost Estimates and Financing Plan \n\nE. \n \nThe total project cost is estimated at $2.5 million, including contingencies and financial \n81. \ncharges.

The  procurement  packages  for  establishing  AML/CFT  IT \ninfrastructure  and  designing  RSEBL\u2019s  website  and  upgrading  its  depository  system  in  the \nprocurement  plan  (Appendix  10)  will  be  procured  through  shopping  procedures  and  under \nturnkey contracts to ensure the appropriateness and sustainability of their design, supply, and \ninstallation. The Government will be responsible for the procurement plan, and ADB shall carry \nthe  Government\u2019s  procedures,  documents,  bid  evaluations,  award \nout \nrecommendations,  and  contract  in  accordance  with  the  agreed  procedures,  on  a  no-objection \nbasis. \n \n\nreviews  on \n\n4. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n \n86. \nA total of 24 person-months of international consulting services and 21 person-months of \nnational consulting services will be financed by the project loan. The outline terms of references \nare in Appendix 9. Two different selection methods will be utilized, as both individual consultants \nand a consultancy firm will be recruited.  With the exception of component 3, consulting services \nwill be provided by individual consultants recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the \nUse  of  Consultants  (2006).  For  component  3,  consulting  services  will  be  provided  by  a \nconsultancy firm recruited in accordance with the quality and cost-based selection method.  The \nProject will also finance the secondment and training programs for supporting sector capacity. \nThe  breakdown  of  consulting  inputs  and  selection  methods  for  each  component  are \nsummarized  in  Table  4.

MOF, on behalf of the Government, will open an imprest account denominated in dollars \nat  RMA  within  1  month  of  loan  effectiveness.  The  imprest  account  will  be  operated  and \nmaintained  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Handbook  on  Loan  Disbursement  (2001),  as  amended \nfrom time to time, and detailed arrangements agreed between the Government and ADB. ADB \nwill advance 6 months of estimated expenditures or 10% of the total, whichever is less, into the \nimprest account for each of the loan amount. The Borrower will use the imprest account to pay \ncontractors,  suppliers,  and  others  for  ADB\u2019s  share  of  eligible  project  expenditures  incurred  in \nlocal  and  foreign  currency.  The  ADB  statement  of  expenditure  procedure  may  be  used  for \nreimbursement  of  eligible  expenditure  and  to  liquidate  advances  provided  into  the  imprest \naccount for any individual payment not exceeding $50,000.  \n \n\n6. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n \n88. \nThe  PMU  will  maintain  separate  records  and  accounts  for  the  imprest  account  in \naccordance with sound accounting principles and will have these accounts and records audited \nannually  in  accordance  with  standards  acceptable  to  ADB.  Audited  accounts,  including \nstatement  of  expenditures,  will  be  provided  to  ADB  within  6  months  of  fiscal  year-end.  ADB \nretains the right to (i) audit any account and (ii) verify the validity of the certification issued by \nthe Government for each withdrawal application.  \n \n89. \nThe PMU will submit reports to ADB concerning the use of project loan proceeds, project \nadministration,  and  financial  management.  The  reports  will  include  (i)  6  monthly  and  annual \nproject implementation reports, (ii) a midterm review report, and (iii) a project completion report \nto be submitted no later than 6 months after project completion. The reports and consolidating \ninputs  from  the  IAs  will  cover  (i)  expenditures,  (ii)  activities  financed,  (iii)  a  summary  of  audit \nissues, and (iv) the progress of project components. \n \nThe  consultants  for  each  component  of  the  project  loan  will  prepare  (i)  an  inception \n90. \nreport  within  1  month  of  service  commencement;  (ii)  midterm  reports  at  appropriate  stages  of \nthe project; (iii) a draft final report 2 weeks before completing the contract; and (iv) a final report \nafter incorporating comments from ADB, the EA, and the IAs.  \n \n91. \nADB  has  assessed  the  financial  management  capacity  of  the  EA  and  IAs  and  found  it \nsatisfactory  at  a  program  and  project  level  (Appendix  8).  The  project  will  further  enhance \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n25\n\ninstitutional  capacity  in  the  EA  and  IAs  in  financial  management  arrangements  through \naccounting  and  auditing  training  under  the  components  on  building  sector  capacity  and \nimproving accounting and auditing practices.  \n \n\n7. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n \n92. \nThe PMU, drawing on data from IAs, will establish and maintain a project performance-\nmanagement system that will generate 6 monthly and annual reports. The system will be linked \nwith the FSDP and established, as agreed between the Government  and ADB, to ensure that \nthe project is managed efficiently, benefits are maximized, and social impacts are monitored.  \n \n\n8. \n\nProject Review \n\n \nThe Government and ADB will periodically review project implementation. ADB will field \n93. \nregular review missions, including midterm and project completion review missions to coincide \nwhenever  possible  with \nthe  program  reviews.  A  comprehensive  midterm  review  at \napproximately  18  months  from  the  date  of  loan  effectiveness  will  be  undertaken  to  evaluate \nprogress.  These  reviews  will  include  an  evaluation  of  the  project  scope,  implementation \narrangements, and progress with the policy reform agenda. \n \n\n9. \n\nAnticorruption  \n\nthe \n\nIn  conformity  with \n\n \n94. \nrecommendations  of  ADB\u2019s  Second  Governance  and \nAnticorruption Action Plan\u2014which specifies that program and project design should incorporate \nfindings  of  governance,  institutional,  and  corruption  risk  assessments,  and  that  project \ndocumentation  should  clearly  identify  risk  and  risk-management  and  mitigation  measures\u2014a \ndetailed  assessment  of  governance  and  anticorruption  measures  has  been  done \n(Supplementary Appendix C). The summary of the findings is in Appendix 11.  \n \n95. \nAccording  to  funding  agencies\u2019  reports  on  sectoral  assessments,  the  Bhutanese  public \nsector is relatively free of systemic institutional corruption.33 A proxy measure34 to analyze the \nlevel  of  corruption  in  the  public  sector  indicates  a  generally  decreasing  trend  in  assessed \nunallowed  expense  amounts  based  on  RAA  audits.35  In  addition,  RAA  has  become  more \naggressive  in  fulfilling  its  functions  and  is  therefore  more  likely  to  find  instances  of  misuse  of \npublic  funds.  While  there  have  been  no  system-wide  corruption  assessments  or  analyses \nconducted  to  date,  it  is  fair  to  conclude  that  Bhutan  poses  a  lesser  risk  of  system-wide  and \ninstitutionalized corruption in the public sector. \n \n96. \nThe  Government  has  taken  serious  steps  to  prevent  corruption.  Anticorruption  policy \nactions include (i) drafting an anticorruption law designed to help detect, prosecute, and punish \nperpetrators of any corrupt practices;36 (ii) encouraging the incorporation of legal units in every \npublic  body  to  address  legal  issues  and  strengthening  internal  audits  of  departments;  (iii) \nrevising  procedures  for  procuring  goods,  awarding  contracts,  bidding,  and  licensing;  (iv) \n\n                                                 \n33  For  example,  the  World  Bank  has  stated  that  the  Government  has  \u201ca  long-standing  reputation  for  honesty  and \n\nprofessionalism\u201d (World Bank. 2004. Bhutan Country Brief. Washington, DC [September]). \n\n34  The measure looks at total amounts cited by RAA audits that are due the Government from public sector bodies for \n\nexpenditures unallowable under existing Government rules (e.g., the Financial Rules and Regulations). \n\n35  The  unallowed  expenses  include,  for  procurement  without  tendering,  wasteful  expenditures,  irregular  contract \nmanagement, non-levying of liquidated damages, etc. The levels of such expenditures reflected in RAA audits (Nu \nmillion) are as follows: 2000: 1,095; 2001: 809; 2002: 638; and 2003: 514.  \n\n36  The  Anticorruption  Act  (2006)  allows  for  establishing  a  three-member  anticorruption  commission  with  extensive \n\npowers mandated to, among others things, \u201ctake all necessary actions to prevent and combat corruption.\u201d \n\n \n\n\f26 \n\n \n\nADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998)  was  explained \n\ninstituting a zero-tolerance approach to raise the risks corrupt elements face; and (v) instituting \na  system  in  which  an  audit  clearance  certificate  is  a  prerequisite  for  each  staff  member\u2019s \npromotion,  training,  and  contract  extension.  There  are  two  updates  on  progress  in  adopting \nBhutan\u2019s anticorruption policies. First, the Anticorruption Act (2006) has been enacted. Second, \nthe  FSDP  will  help  the  Government  strengthen  the  AML/CFT  regime  by  enhancing  the  legal \nframework  (provided  under  the  FSA),  instituting  FIU,  and  establishing  a  reporting  and \nmonitoring procedure for recording and investigating suspicious financial transactions.  \n \n97. \nthe \nGovernment.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance,  accountability,  and \ntransparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged \ncorrupt,  fraudulent,  collusive,  or  coercive  practices  relating  to  the  project  or  the  FSDP.    To \nsupport these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy will be included in the \nloan regulations and the bidding documents for the project. In particular, all contracts financed \nby ADB in connection with the FSDP and the project shall include provisions specifying the right \nof ADB to audit and examine the records and accounts of the EA and IAs, and of all contractors, \nsuppliers, consultants, and other service providers as they relate to the FSDP and the project. \nDuring  regular  review  missions,  governance  and  anticorruption  risk  assessments  will  be \nupdated as necessary. \n \n\nto  and  discussed  with \n\nIV. \n\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n\n \n\n98. \nThe purpose of TA is to help the Government establish a permanent, self-sufficient, and \nsustainable training institute (the Training Institute) for financial sector participants in Bhutan to \naddress existing gaps and future requirements in capacity and institutional strengthening needs \nin  the  financial  sector.  TA  is  also  designed  to  sustain  the  reforms  initiated  under  the  FSDP \nbeyond the program period. TA will fund the following activities: (i) developing and implementing \nthe Training Institute in RMA, which will act as a center of excellence in the financial sector; (ii) \nselecting a Training Institute head, who will prepare the business plan for the institute on a cost \nrecovery/self  sufficiency  basis  (i.e.,  fees  will  be  charged  to  participants);  (iii)  conducting  an \ninventory of skills in RMA, matching these with the skills required for RMA to enforce the FSA in \nBhutan,  and    further  assessing  the  training  needs  of  RMA  and  various  financial  service \nproviders, including professionals, and preparing relevant courses for meeting them; (iv) rolling \nout  a  pilot  training  program  for  RMA  staff  and  relevant  market  participants;  and  (v)  coaching \ncounterpart  staff  in  RMA  that  will  take  over  the  management  responsibilities  of  the  Training \nInstitute.37 \n \n99. \nTA will require a total of 6 person-months of international consulting services from one \ncentral banking and financial sector training expert. TA will  also acquire training services from \nresource people and/or experienced regional trainers who specialize in delivering courses and \n\n                                                 \n37  Previous  ADB  technical  assistance  (ADB.  2000.  Technical  Assistance  to  the  Kingdom  of  Bhutan  for  Project \nAppraisal and Portfolio Management for Financial Institutions. Manila [TA 3596-BHU, approved on 19 December].) \nhelped  RMA  establish  the  Institute  for  Financial  Sector  Development.  However,  the  outcome  was  unsatisfactory \nand  the  institute  has  not  provided  any  technical  training  since  2004,  when  TA3596  was  completed.  The  TA \ncompletion  report  pointed  out  that  the  institute  was  not  able  to  deliver  training  via  the  train-the-trainer  program \nbecause  the  selected  trainers  were  not  able  to  commit  their  time  to  design,  prepare,  and  deliver  the  training \nprograms (ADB. 2005. Technical Assistance Completion Report on Project Appraisal and Portfolio Management for \nFinancial  Institutions  in  Bhutan.  Manila.)  The  report  further  suggested  that  similar  future  projects  should  use \nconsulting  services  to  develop,  supervise,  and  assist  in  monitoring  the  training  program  and  to  ensure  that  the \ntarget training facility functions on a sustainable basis to achieve long-term impact. As such, the piggy-backed TA \nwill  incorporate  these  lessons  as  well  as  consider  linking  and  pricing  training  to  the  granting  of  licenses  and \nprofessional accreditations to market participants in Bhutan. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n27\n\nworkshops on current topics in financial regulation and supervising FSA-type monetary systems, \naccounting  and  auditing  for  financial  service  providers,  and  other  relevant  fields  (a  total  of  3 \nperson-months  from  different  resource  persons).  The  consultant  will  be  recruited  using  the \nconsultants\u2019  qualifications  selection  method  according  to  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants  (2006).  The  resource  persons  will  be  recruited  for  their  qualifications  and  the \nsuitability  of  their  relevant  experience  in  delivering  training  programs.  The  outline  terms  of \nreference for the international consultant are in Appendix 12.  \n \n100.  The total TA cost is estimated at $312,000. ADB will finance $250,000 on a grant basis \nthrough  its  TA  funding  program,  and  the  Government  will  contribute  $62,000  in  kind  as \ncounterpart  staff,  office  accommodation,  training  facilities,  and  logistical  support.  The  detailed \ncost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 12. MOF will be the EA. RMA will be the IA. \nTA will be implemented over a period of 24 months, commencing from the date of program loan \nthe  TA \neffectiveness.  The  consulting  services  will  be  delivered \nimplementation period. \n \n\nintermittently  over \n\nV. \n\nPROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n\nBenefits \n\n \nA. \n \n101.  The  FSDP  promotes  a  better-regulated  financial  system  more  effectively  enforced  that \noperates under the principles of good governance and so encourages the development of more \nefficient and commercially oriented financial institutions. It is envisaged to engender competition \nand thereby invigorate the private sector, promote economic growth, and reduce poverty.  \n\n \n\n \n\n102.  Specific benefits can be outlined as follows:  \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nThe  strengthened  supervisory  and  regulatory  framework  for  the  banking  and \nsecurities  markets,  and  the  development  of  a  much-needed  framework  for \ninsurance, will contribute to financial soundness. In particular, a proper regulatory \nand  supervisory  framework  for  insurance  operations  will  ensure  that  insurance \nbusinesses  are  structured  in  a  sustainable  manner  and  provide  adequate \nsolvency  to  protect  policyholders\u2019  funds  and  minimize  the  risk  of  ruin  for  the \ninsurer.  The  FSDP  also  encourages  private  sector  entry  in  the  financial  sector \nthrough  new  licensing  and  competent  regulation  and  oversight,  which  will \nincrease competition and lower the cost of financial intermediation. \nThe improved corporate governance structure, enhanced operational efficiencies, \nand  human  resource  development  will  enhance  responsiveness  to  lending \nopportunities  and  performance  incentives,  thus  contributing  to  financial  stability \nand  enabling  financial  institutions  to  diversify  their  operations  and  thereby \nimprove profitability. \nEstablishing  a  CIB  and  developing  Bhutanese  accounting  and  auditing  policies \nand  standards  will  improve  the  quality  of  credit  assessment  and  the  financial \ndisclosure  of  financial  institutions.  Institutions\u2019  disclosure  and  sharing  of  credit \nprofiles  will  also  boost  lender  confidence,  mitigate  risk,  and  lower  the  cost  of \nfinance and consequently improve access to credit.  \nAn  effective  AML/CFT  framework  will  strengthen  general  investor  confidence  in \nthe financial system, as it will deter criminal and corrupt elements from using the \nsystem  to  launder  proceeds.  It  will  also  raise  Bhutan\u2019s  international  profile  as  a \nwell-managed and disciplined financial system. \nMuch-needed  project  components  for  program  implementation  will  fast  track \nskills  development  in  the  supervisory  and  regulatory  authority,  and  among \nfinancial  institutions,  to  effectively  implement  the  provisions  of  new  legislation \n\n \n\n\f28 \n\n \n\n(vi) \n\ndesigned  to  strengthen  the  foundation  of  the  financial  system  and  help  it  cope \nwith the challenges of liberalization and private sector development. \nTA  will  help  the  regulatory  authority  establish  a  permanent,  self-sufficient,  and \nsustainable  finance  training  institute.  It  will  serve  the  financial  community  in \nBhutan  by  educating  and  developing  financial  professionals  and  improving \naccess to knowledge in financial areas for individuals and networks. \n\n \nRisks and Safeguards \n\nB. \n \n103.  The FSDP design is based on lessons learned from earlier ADB assistance in Bhutan. \nThe success and impact of the FSDP are subject to different types of risks of varying degrees. \nMitigating measures have been incorporated in the FSDP as appropriate and possible.   \n \n104.  While a potential risk to FSDP implementation is how the Government will implement the \nreforms  and  follow  through,  it  is  fully  committed  to  the  needed  reforms,  as  evidenced  by  its \npronouncements  and  actions  taken  up  front.  The  work  on  strengthening  legal  provisions  for \nfurther  financial  sector  development\u2014e.g.,  drafting  the  revised  RMA  Act  and  FSA\u2014has  been \nprogressing for some time, and official comments from other funding agencies (e.g., IMF) have \nbeen received and incorporated into the revised RMA Act and draft FSA. In addition, the draft \nacts will be finalized by the Government as conditions for loan effectiveness. The Government \nhas  shown  strong  ownership  of  the  needed  financial  sector  reforms  through  extensive \nconsultation with stakeholders and ADB. In addition, the revised RMA Act is to be enacted by \nend-2006  to  give  RMA  greater  autonomy  and  independence  to  carry  out  the  adequate \nregulation and supervision of all financial institutions and activities.   \n \n105.  Another  potential  risk  to  program  implementation  is  the  inadequacy  of  institutional \ncapacity  in  RMA  and  financial  institutions  to  carry  out  the  reform  agenda.  This  particularly \nentails the issues of (i) whether the new FSA will be fully understood and reviewed for passage; \n(ii) how strengthened rules and regulations are implemented, complied with, and enforced; and \n(iii)  whether  there  are  sufficient  resources  to  carry  out  program  implementation.  The  FSDP \ntherefore  places  strong  emphasis  on  consultation  and  technical  training  for  new  rules  and \nregulations  to  ensure  awareness  and  broad  ownership  of  the  reforms.  More  specifically, \ntraining, including medium and long-term training and secondment programs will be provided to \nRMA  and  IAs  on,  among  other  topics,  regulatory  and  supervisory  skills,  securities  markets, \ninsurance underwriting, and accounting and auditing. The piggy-backed TA will further enhance \nand  sustain  the  effectiveness  of  the  financial  training  for  the  regulatory  authority  and  financial \nprofessionals. \n \n106.  Resistance  from  vested  interests  to  certain  reform  measures  is  a  potential  risk.  This \nparticularly  relates  to  strengthening  the  governance  structure  and  operations  of  financial \ninstitutions.  Potential  resistance  may  arise  from  the  reform  measures  affecting  corporate \ngovernance regulations regarding BOBL and RICBL. However, the Government has expressed \nstrong commitment and further confirmed that the revised RMA Act will give the regulator, RMA, \ngreater autonomy to regulate the whole financial sector, including corporate governance issues. \nThe FSDP also has measures to ensure that RMA is able to regulate and take remedial action \nto  enforce corporate  governance  under  FSA  legislation  and  relevant  regulations. Furthermore, \nat the level of the individual financial institution, RICBL has taken the initiative to prepare a new \nbusiness  plan  for  the  Credit  and  Investment  Department,  with  TA  support  from  SEDF,  and \nprepare  for  the  rationalization  of  its  own  operations.  Similarly,  BOBL  also  received  assistance \nfrom SEDF to upgrade its IT infrastructure, prepare a new business plan and human resources \nstrategy, and improve lending skills and operational efficiency. These institutional initiatives will \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n29\n\nImpacts \n\ncomplement  the  proposed  reform  measures  for  good  governance  under  the  FSDP  aiming  to \nimprove the operational efficiency of financial institutions. \n  \nC. \n \n107.  The  FSDP  is  classified  as  environmental  category  C.  It  is  not  expected  to  generate \nadverse environmental impacts requiring mitigating measures. The detailed review of potential \nenvironment impacts of policy actions is in Supplementary Appendix D. The specific social and \npoverty  impact  of  the  FSDP  is  in  Appendix  13  (summary  of  poverty  reduction  and  social \nstrategy). \n \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \n\nVI. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n \n108. \nassurances, which will be incorporated into the legal documents: \n \nA. \n\nProgram Loan \n \n(i) \n\nfinancial \n\nto  meet  all \n\nrequirements  associated  with \n\nThe policies and actions to be taken before the date of ADB\u2019s Board of Directors \napproval  of  the  program  loan,  as  described  in  the  policy  matrix  and  the \nGovernment\u2019s development policy letter, will continue in effect for the duration of \nthe program and subsequently. \nThe  Government  will  adopt  the  policies  and  take  such  actions  included  in  the \nprogram and as specified in the policy matrix in a proper and timely manner and \nwill  ensure  that  once  such  adoption  and  actions  have  been  taken  that  they  will \ncontinue  to  be  in  full  force  and  effect  for  the  duration  of  the  program  and \nsubsequently. \nThe Government will ensure that the proceeds of the program loan will be made \nthe \nthe \navailable \nimplementation of the program. \nThe  Government  will  keep  ADB  informed  of  policy  discussions  with  other \nmultilateral  and  bilateral  aid  agencies  that  may  have  implications  for  the \nimplementation  of  the  program,  and  will  provide  ADB  with  an  opportunity  to \ncomment  on  any  resulting  policy  proposals.  The  Government  will  take  ADB\u2019s \nviews into account before finalizing and implementing any such proposals. \nThe Government shall form the PSC, which will provide policy support, oversee \nprogram  and  project  implementation  and  progress,  facilitate  cooperation  and \ncoordination  among  all  relevant  agencies,  and  ensure  timely  achievement  of \nreform actions with respect to the program.

The  conditions  of  the  effectiveness  of  the  program  loan,  which  are  the  first  tranche \nconditions as described in Appendix 4, are to be met satisfactorily.  \n \n\nVII. \n\nRECOMMENDATION  \n\n \n111. \nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  loans  would  comply  with  the  Articles  of  Agreement  of \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and,  acting  in  the  absence  of  the  President,  under  the \nprovisions  of  Article  35.1  of  the  Articles  of  Agreement  of  ADB,  I  recommend  that  the  Board \napprove \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nthe  loan  in  various  currency  equivalent  to  Special  Drawing  Rights  7,472,000  to \nthe  Kingdom  of  Bhutan  for  the  Financial  Sector  Development  Program  from \nADB\u2019s Special Funds resources, with an interest charge at the rate of 1.0 % per \nannum  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5%  per  annum  thereafter;  a  term  of  24 \nyears, including a grace period of 8 years; and such other terms and conditions \nas are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft Program Loan \nAgreement presented to the Board; and \nthe loan in various currencies equivalent to Special Drawing Rights 1,359,000 to \nthe  Kingdom  of  Bhutan  for  the  Financial  Sector  Development  Program  from \nADB\u2019s Special Funds resources, with an interest charge at the rate of 1.0 % per \nannum  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5%  per  annum  thereafter;  a  term  of  32 \nyears, including a grace period of 8 years; and such other terms and conditions \nas  are  substantially  in  accordance with  those  set  forth  in  the  draft  Project  Loan \nAgreement presented to the Board.  \n\nLiqun Jin \nVice President \n\n \n13 November 2006 \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\fSECTOR AND SUBSECTOR ANALYSIS \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n31 \n\n \nA. \n \n\nBanking Sector \n\n1. \n\nBackground \n\n \n1. \nThe  first  bank  in  Bhutan  started  in 1968  when the  Bank  of  Bhutan  Limited  (BOBL)  was \nfounded. Currently, BOBL mobilizes revenue  and budgetary payments across the country. The \nsecond bank, Bhutan National Bank Limited (BNBL), started operating in 1997 to provide lending \nto  the  private  sector  when  the  Unit  Trust  of  Bhutan  (UTB)  was  converted  into  a  full  fledged \ncommercial bank.1   \n \n\n2. \n\nFinancial Performance and Operations \n\n \n2. \nPerformance.  BOBL  is  a  highly  capitalized  institution  with  a  risk-based  capital  ratio  of \n24.87% as of 31 December 2005. Nonperforming loans (NPLs) were only 4.78% of total loans.  \nAbout  20%  of  BOBL's  assets  were  invested  neither  in  securities  nor  loans  and  remained  idel \nwithout any return as of year-end 2005. Nevertheless, the assets that did generate a return were \nsufficient to produce a return on assets (ROA) of 1.04% and a return on equity (ROE) of 12.14%. \nLiquidity  reached  66.47%  of  total  deposits,  or  Nu6.2  billion,  well  above  the  statutory  liquidity \nrequirement (i.e. 20% of total deposits) or Nu1.86 billion. BNBL\u2019s risk-based capital ratio as of 31 \nDecember 2005 was a  comfortable 16.90%, well above the 8% required minimum. NPLs were \nan acceptable 7.95% of total loans, although 42% of the loan portfolio was concentrated in the \nhousing sector. Performance was 2.11% as measured by ROA and 19.11% by ROE. The bank's \nliquidity position exceeded the statutory requirement of Nu1.4 billion by Nu612 million. \n \n3. \nCredit  Portfolio.  Bhutan\u2019s  banks  run  large  sectoral  concentrations.  The  large  sectors \nwere  lending  for  housing,  personal  and  other  loans  (in  the  sequence  of  volume)  followed  by \nbuilding  and  construction.  Total  lending  to  manufacturing  from  banks  grew  by  6%.  The  same \nappears  to  occur  in  trade  and  commerce.  Lending  is  small  to  transport  (5%)  and  agriculture \n(4%), with BOBL withdrawing from both sectors.  \n \nIn  2005,  the  two  commercial  banks  accounted  for  53%  of  credit  to  the  private  sector, \n4. \ndown from 68% in 2004. Credit to the private sector grew on average only by 10% year on year; \nwhen personal loans are excluded, it fell by 21%, from Nu6,178 million in June 2004 to Nu4,896 \nmillion in June 2005. However, relative to total lending, credit to the private sector decreased by \n22% on average (Table A1.1). \n \n\nTable A1.1: Claims on Private Sector over Total Lending, 2000\u20132005(%) \n\nInstitution \nBOBL \nBNBL \nBDFCL \nRICBL \n\n2000 \n25.9 \n30.7 \n16.2 \n28.4 \n\n2001 \n26.4 \n26.8 \n14.1 \n26.8 \n\n2002 \n29.5 \n34.7 \n18.5 \n 1.0 \n\n2003 \n22.6 \n30.3 \n15.0 \n16.8 \n\n2004 \n28.4 \n39.7 \n15.4 \n18.2 \n\n2005 \n21.9 \n31.3 \n12.2 \n14.2 \n\n% Change 2004/05 \n(22.9) \n(21.2) \n(21.0) \n(22.3) \n\n(  )  =  negative,  BDFCL  =  Bhutan  Development  Finance  Corporation  Limited,  BNBL  =  Bhutan  National  Bank  Limited, \nBOBL = Bank of Bhutan Limited, RICBL = Royal Insurance Corporation of Bhutan Limited. \nNote: From January 2003, economic sector accounts were reclassified, so data prior to 2002 cannot always be directly \ncompared with subsequent data. \nSource:  Royal Monetary Authority. 2006. Annual Report 2004\u20132005, January (data as at 30 June 2005). \n                                                 \n1   UTB  was  established  in  July  1980  and  functioned  as  a  division  of  the  Royal  Insurance  Corporation  of  Bhutan \nLimited. In 1992, UTB became an independent financial institution with a mandate to promote and mobilize private \nsector  savings  and  direct  additional  capital  to  the  private  sector.  The  Royal  Government  of  Bhutan,  with  the \nassistance of Asian Development Bank (ADB) (ADB. 1995. Technical Assistance to the Kingdom of Bhutan for the \nConversion  of  the  Unit  Trust  of  Bhutan  to  a  Commercial  Bank.  Manila  (TA  2284-BHU,  approved  on  4  January), \nconverted UTB into the Bhutan National Bank Limited on 5 December 1996.  \n\n\f32 \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n \n\nInterest  Rate  Spreads.  In  September  1997,  the  RMA  liberalized  interest  rates  on  both \n5. \ndeposits and lending, and in 1999 it eliminated the cap on the maximum spread between deposit \nand  lending  rates.  From  that  date,  financial  institutions  could  set  their  own  interest  rates. \nHowever, since then, liberalization of market forces has had little influence on interest rates, and \nfinancial institutions have stuck to the previous administered rates, making little effort to assess \ncredit or liquidity risk for pricing their loans.  \n \n\n3. \n\nRegulation and Supervision \n\n \n6. \nCommercial  banks  and  non-bank  financial  institutions  (NBFIs)  are  subject  to  detailed \nmonthly,  quarterly,  and  annual  reporting  requirements,  with  reports  analyzed  in  relation  to \nprudential standards. RMA issued prudential regulations in 1999 under the Financial Institutions \nAct  (1992).  It  updated  this  regulation  in  line  with  the  Basel  Committee\u2019s  Core  Principles  with \nPrudential  Regulations  (2002).  These  regulations  cover  (i)  capital  adequacy,  (ii) \nloan \nclassification,  (iii)  provisioning,  (iv)  credit  concentration,  (v)  liquidity,  and  (vi)  good  governance. \nHowever, they have yet to conform fully with international standards and, in a number of cases, \nare neither uniformly nor consistently applied in the absence of national accounting or auditing \nstandards or a uniform chart of accounts for financial institutions.  \n \nCapital  Adequacy.  The  minimum  capital  requirement  has  been  set  at  8%  of  risk-\n7. \nweighted  assets  for  all  financial  institutions  since  2002.  This  level  is  used  by  industrialized \ncountries  but  should  be  higher  for  developing  countries  such  as  Bhutan  (i.e.,  10%  is  used  in \nBangladesh and Nepal) to incorporate a higher risk premium for emerging market conditions. At \nyear-end  2005,  all  financial  institutions  had  capital  adequacy  ratios  exceeding  the  minimum \nrequirements. An increase in the capital adequacy ratio to 10% of risk-weighted assets would be \neasily met and in line with emerging markets best practice. \n \nLoan Classification. The Prudential Regulations (2002) provide a lenient timeframe for \n8. \nsubstandard  loan  classification.  The  current  regulation  fails  to  conform  with  international \nstandards.2 Substandard loans go as long as a year before being classified as doubtful. Doubtful \nloans are declared as loss after 2 years. Moreover, bad loans that would have been written off \nusing  international  standards  after  1  year  remain  on  the  institutions'  books  indefinitely,  as \ninstitutions are not allowed to write them off easily; for tax reasons, only a court order can allow \nthe  write  off.  From  an  accounting  perspective,  the  institutions  are  under-provisioning  and \noverstating the size and quality of their loan portfolio in international standards.  \n \n9. \nProvisioning.  Banks  in  Bhutan  are  required  to  follow  international  standards  of \nprovisioning,3  and  these  requirements  are  being  phased  in  with  a  completion  date  of  year-end \n2006. However, current provisions against loans secured by risk-free collateral (cash deposits in \nthe  banks,  precious  metals,  and  securities  issued  by  RMA  or  the  Government  of  Bhutan  [the \nGovernment]) are calculated on the difference between the principal amount and the value of the \nrisk-free  collateral,  which  is  not  consistent  with  international  best  practice  requiring  full \nprovisioning of the loan. This practice indicates that the banks are currently under-provisioned for \nsuch loans. \n \n10. \nCredit Concentration. There are proper regulations on loan concentration that limit the \namount of credit extended to a single borrower and to the bank\u2019s 10 largest borrowers. However, \nthe  exposure  of  a  bank  to  a  particular  sector  is  not  restricted,  so  the  lack  of  portfolio \n                                                 \n2   International best practice requires that a loan be classified as nonperforming if its principal or interest or both are 3 \n\nmonths or more in arrears, or if the loan continuously exceeds its approved limit for 3 months or more.  \n\n3   Provisioning rates: (i) substandard = 20%, (ii) doubtful = 50%, and (iii) loss = 100%. General provision for standard \n\n(and watch) = 1.5%. \n\n\fAppendix 1 \n\n33 \n\ndiversification  remains  a  risk.  Large  sectoral  concentrations  constitute  a  source  of  risk  that \nshould be monitored and, if judged excessive by the Financial Institutions Supervision Division, \noffset by additions to the bank's capital. The division should monitor sectoral concentrations via \nthe off-site reporting mechanism.  \n \nLiquidity,  Interest  Rate,  and  Foreign  Exchange  Risk.  Exposure  to  foreign  exchange \n11. \nand interest rate risk has not been addressed in the RMA regulation. Furthermore, with respect \nto liquidity risk, the statutory liquidity ratio provides a percentage to be applied to each banking \ncompany's  demand  and  time  deposits  and  the  Prudential  Regulation  (2002)  describes  the \nmaturity mismatch approach (or gap analysis) to analyze the short-term exposure to liquidity risk \n(i.e.  short-term  mismatches  between  their  assets  and  liabilities).  However,  the  regulation  on \nliquidity risk management has not been implemented due to no guideline providing instructions \nor numerical examples on presenting and examining banks\u2019 maturity profiles. As a result, there \nmay be a need to prepare a simple reporting format for the banks to measure maturity matching \nand for the RMA to monitor. \n \nGovernance.  Financial  institutions  are  required  to  submit  periodic  reports  to  RMA  on \n12. \ntheir  activities  and  financial  performance.  This  accountability  process  is  straightforward  for \nbanks.  Institutions\u2019  accountability  to  shareholders  is  complied  with  through  audited  annual \nfinancial statements. Auditors have reported some violations in their reports. However, RMA has \nnot taken stern action against any banks for violations but has taken the approach of discussing \nthe matter with management to search for resolutions. The enforcement of regulations will need \nto  be  strengthened  to  avoid  moral  hazard  along  with  the  ability  of  RMA  to  impose  severe \npenalties accordingly.  \n \n13. \nBank Licensing. The Financial Institutions Act (1992) provides a regulation for licensing \ndomestically registered banks and NBFIs. Nonetheless, there is no licensing regulation in Bhutan \nthat specifies detailed conditions to minimize any possibility of the applicant\u2019s innocent omission \nor intentional evasion. The application to license a bank typically includes information regarding \nprojected  operations,  biographical  report  for  each  promoter  and  director  of  the  proposed  bank, \nan elaboration of the business plan, and a sensitivity analysis indicating the impact of probable \nchanges in key variables (e.g., credits, deposits, and interest rate spreads) on the viability of the \nproposed financial institution. \n \nB. \n \n\nNBFIs \n\n1. \n\nBackground \n\n \n14. \nDevelopment  Finance.  Until  1988,  development  banking  activities  in  Bhutan  were \ncarried  out  by  the  rural  credit  and  industrial  credit  sections  of  RMA.  The  Bhutan  Development \nFinance Corporation Limited (BDFCL) took on this function in 1988 when it separated from RMA. \nBDFCL  lends  to  large  private  sector  industrial  clients,  but  it  also  extends  credit  to  small  and \nmedium-sized enterprises and agricultural businesses, requiring less collateral than is specified \nby the commercial banks. Recently, BDFCL implemented a group guarantee lending and saving \nscheme (microcredit) program that targets the poorest rural residents. BDFCL is also piloting a \nmicrosavings scheme. \n\n \n\n15. \nInsurance. The Royal Insurance Corporation of Bhutan Limited (RICBL) was established \nin 19754 and provides life and general insurance. Premiums charged are comparable with those \nof insurance providers in India, and approximately 70% of its insurance business originates in its \nhead office in Phuentsholing. RICBL utilizes insurance premiums received to make investments. \n\n                                                 \n4  RICBL was set up under a Royal Charter in 1975 and still operates under it. \n\n\f34 \n\nAppendix 1 \n\nIts  charter  allows  it  to  accept  deposits,  but  it  is  not  a  licensed  bank.  RICBL  has  also  provided \nloans  through  its  Credit  and  Investment  Department  (CID).  RICBL  writes  both  life  and  general \nbusiness policies as a composite insurer, contrary to modern international practice, as laid down \nby the International Association of Insurance Supervisors. It counts a staff of 150. RICBL and the \nNational  Pension  and  Provident  Fund  (NPPF)  rely  heavily  on  professional  input  from  retained \nforeign consultants, mainly from India.   \n \n16. \nPensions.  The  pensions  market  is  relatively  untapped  in  Bhutan.  The  Government \nEmployees  Provident  Fund,  which RICBL  had  managed  since  1976, was  transferred  to  NPPF, \nan autonomous public sector body,  in April 2000, which is worth Nu1.2 billion, or equivalent of \nover 80% of RICBL\u2019s assets at the time, causing RICBL a liquidity shortfall.  \n \n\n2. \n\nFinancial Performance and Operations \n\n \n17. \nPerformance.  Total  lending  by  the  two  NBFIs  to  30  June  2005  was  down  to  Nu2,759 \nfrom Nu2,886 million in 2004, or a 4.4% decrease. BDFCL\u2019s share of total lending declined from \n13.5% in 2000 to 12% in 2005. RICBL suffered the most significant drop, from 22% in 2000 to \n14% in 2005. NBFIs demonstrate higher profitability than banks. However, their NPL ratio is also \nhigher and has been increasing since 2004. In addition, NBFIs have no excess liquidity.   \n \nThe  NPLs  ratio  in  BDFCL  is  the  largest,  at  22.16%  of  total  loans  as  of  year-end  2005. \n18. \nHowever,  as  the  NPL  is  properly  provisioned  in  line  with  international  standards  (i.e.  100% \nprovisioning rate for loan loss) this does not pose anymore burden to BDFCL. The high NPL is \ndue  to  its  exposure  to  small  loans  in  the  agricultural  sector  and  poor  credit  risk  assessment. \nNevertheless, ROA was acceptable at a ratio of 6.59%, as was ROE at 14.74%. The risk-based \ncapital  ratio  was  an  astonishing  48.98%.    Liquidity  exceeded  the  10%  requirement  by  a  very \nsmall margin.  \n \nRICBL  is  at  present  implicitly  regulated  under  the  banking  rules  and  regulations. \n19. \nConsidering its notable involvement in lending activities, RICBL has a relatively sizeable capital \ncushion, with a risk-based capital ratio of 20.99%, compared to other commercial banks. Also, its \nprofitability  as  measured  by  ROA  (4.80%)  and  ROE  (21.35%)  has  been  healthy.  At  the  end  of \n2005,  NPLs  were  19.75%.  In  the  case  of  RICBL,  the  high  NPL  ratio  derives  from  poor  credit \nanalysis and pressure on its CID to guarantee a 7\u20138% return. During 2005, RICBL experienced \na liquidity shortfall of Nu77 million. The major concern about RICBL is that it is not operating as a \ntrue insurance company, according to international best practice, but as a credit institution that is \nalso  the  country\u2019s  sole  provider  of  insurance  products.  This  raises  questions  regarding  its  true \nsolvency and the liquidity of its assets, and hence its ability to pay claims in a timely way.  \n \n20. \nCredit Portfolio. Almost 99% of lending to agriculture comes from BDFCL, and lending \nto  agriculture  represents  17%  of  BDFCL\u2019s  loan  portfolio.  This  sector  used  to  account  for  just \nunder  40%  of  BDFCL\u2019s  loan  portfolio  in  2000,  signifying  the  rising  importance  of  housing  and \npersonal  loans  in  the  portfolios  of  NBFIs.  Nevertheless,  without  BDFCL,  small  agriculture \nprojects  would  find  it  difficult  to  obtain  funds  at  reasonable  interest  rates.  RICBL  provides  just \nover 21% of all mortgages and is the second largest mortgage provider after BNBL, with a share \nof financial assets of 5.7%. Mortgages represent 45% of RICBL\u2019s loan portfolio.  \n \n21. \nInsurance  Portfolio.  RICBL\u2019s  insurance  portfolio  is  fairly  conventional,  given  the \ndemographics  of  the  market  in  Bhutan.  Motor  third  party  liability  insurance  is  compulsory,  as \nstipulated  in  the  Road  Safety  Act,  and  the  Government  is  drafting  a  labor  law  that  will  likely \ninclude  compulsory  workmen\u2019s  compensation  insurance.  The  RICBL  also  operates  the \nGovernment\u2019s Rural Insurance Scheme, covering over 56,000 households in 2004.   \n \n\n\fAppendix 1 \n\n35 \n\n3.  \n\nRegulation and Supervision \n\nDevelopment Finance. Same as banks. \n\n22. \nInvestment  Portfolio.  RICBL  currently  transfers  the  entire  retained  premium  (premium \nearned  minus  reinsurance  premium  paid)  to  its  CID.  The  return  is  reviewed  annually.  BOBL \nwould pay only 4% on any deposit account. \n \n \n \n23. \n \n24. \nInsurance.  There  are  no  explicit  insurance  regulations.  RICBL  is  currently  supervised \nonly under banking regulations relevant to its credit activities. The critical items to be addressed \nare as follows: (i) matching assets and liability from an insurance business perspective is virtually \nnon-existent; (ii) there is no sense of admissible assets to provide suitable reserves for different \nclasses  of  business,  according  to  international  best  practice;  (iii)  no  solvency  margin  currently \nexists  for  general  business;  (iv)  life  insurance  applies  a  4%  solvency  margin,  but  this  is  not \nlegislated or regulated; (v) premiums in the annual report (revenue account) are reported net of \nreinsurance  when  it  should  be  done  on  a  gross  basis;  and  (vi)  no  requirement  exists  for  an \nto  enable \nappropriate  reserving  system  or  corresponding  risk-management \ninstitutions to withstand major disasters or adverse claim experiences. International Association \nof  Insurance  Supervisors  principles  state  that  all  insurance  entities  must  have,  at  a  minimum, \nadequate  solvency  margins,  paid-up  capital,  and  criteria  for  sound  management.  The  current \nlack of such regulations in Bhutan make it very difficult for RMA to adequately supervise RICBL.   \n \n25. \nNo full time actuary works in RICBL or NPPF; pricing products and producing the annual \nactuarial valuation of all RICBL life plans in force, as specified in the Financial Institutions Act of \nBhutan (2002), are apparently outsourced to a consulting actuary.  \n \n26. \nPensions.  NPPF  is  administered  and  regulated  by  the  National  Pension  and  Provident \nBoard,  an  autonomous  body  set  up  in  April  2000  and  empowered  by  the  Government  to \nundertake  its  mandate  according  to  a  set  of  rules  and  regulations  that  are  expected  to  be \nreplaced when the draft Pension Fund Act is adopted.  \n \nC. \n \n27. \nBackground.  The  Royal  Securities  Exchange  of  Bhutan  Limited  (RSEBL)  was \nincorporated  in  1993  under  the  Companies  Act  and  Financial  Institutions  Act  to  meet  capital \nmarket needs in Bhutan. It operates with five employees.   \n \n\nSecurities Market and Securities Brokers \n\ntechniques \n\n1. \n\nFinancial Performance and Operations \n\n \n28. \nPerformance. RSEBL relies for funding on (i) members\u2019 dues (about Nu50,000 per year \nper member); (ii) trading fees (0.02% of trade value); (iii) listing fees (an initial fee of Nu30,000 \nfor equity and annual fees based on paid-up capital); (iv) government debt issue fees (0.5% of \nthe  value  of  the  issue  or  Nu100,000,  whichever  is  less);  and  (v)  \u201cauction  fees\u201d  from  RMA  for \nassistance  in  distributing  RMA  bills.  The  last  source  amounted  to  62%  of  RSEBL\u2019s  2005 \nrevenues. RSEBL would incur unsustainable losses without the RMA payments. \n \n\nTable A1.2: Summary Statistics for Securities Market \n\n \n\nItem \nStock Market Capitalization \nStock Trading Value \u2013 Secondary \nStock Trading Value \u2013 IPOs \nTotal Stock Trading Value \nStock Trading Volume \u2013 Secondary \n\nUnit \nNu million \nNu million \nNu million \nNu million \nNo. \n\n2001 \n2,944 \n79 \n33 \n112 \n157,151 \n\n2002 \n3,442 \n38 \n115 \n153 \n75,043 \n\n2003 \n3,534 \n20 \n409 \n429 \n42,156 \n\n2004 \n4,300 \n109 \n0 \n109 \n284,075 \n\n2005 \n4,467 \n20 \n52 \n72 \n49,198 \n\n\f36 \n\nAppendix 1 \n\nItem \nStock Trading Volume \u2013 IPOs \nTotal Stock Trading Volume \nRMA Bills Trading Value \nGovernment Bonds Trading Value \nGovernment Treasury Bills \nGovernment Treasury Bills Volume \nTotal Debt Trading Value \nCompanies Listed at RSEBL \nShareholders \nNet Profit After Tax of RSEBL \n\nUnit \nNo. \nNo. \nNu million \nNu million \nNu million \nNo. \nNu million \nNo. \nNo. \nNu \n\n2001 \n\n2002 \n\n2003 \n334,032  1,150,000  676,400 \n491,183  1,225,043  718,556 \n2,179 \n1,279 \n500 \n500 \n3,458 \n15 \n15,867 \n-509  310,377 \n\n1,618 \n0 \n500 \n500 \n1,618 \n14 \n6,813 \n185,794 \n\n3,802 \n0 \n500 \n500 \n3,802 \n15 \n11,461 \n\n2004 \n0 \n284,075 \n595 \n990 \n500 \n500 \n1,585 \n15 \n15,110 \n281,663 \n\n2005 \n521,000 \n570,198 \n595 \n0 \n500 \n500 \n595 \n16 \n15,616 \n329,531 \n\nIPO  =  initial  public  offering,  RMA  =  Royal  Monetary  Authority,  RSEBL  =  Royal  Securities  Exchange  of  Bhutan \nLimited. \nSource:  Royal Securities Exchange Bhutan Limited Annual Report 2004. \n\n2. \n\nRegulation and Supervision \n\n \nTrading. RSEBL employs a relatively simple automated order-matching system operated \n29. \nbi-weekly. Its information technology is rather obsolete. No mechanism exists for trading outside \nthe order-match system, either for block trades (with the exception of Citibank\u2019s 2001 sale of its \n19.9%  stake  in  the  BNBL)  or  for  contingent  offers  such  as  tender  offers.  Initial  public  offerings \nare generally subscriptions rather than auctions, as the price is set beforehand.  \n \n30. \nRSEBL  members  are  authorized  to  trade  on  their  own  account  but  limit  themselves  to \nforwarding customer orders. Brokers do not seem to provide any substantial research or analysis \nto customers. The typical transaction appears to be arranged outside the RSEBL and executed \nthrough  one  broker,  who  charges  each  side  1%.  Brokerages  rarely  advertise  their  services  or \nactively solicit new customers.  \n \n \n \n31. \nRSEBL is subject to supervision by RMA, the acting securities commission. RSEBL rules \nare  approved  and  amended  by  RMA.  RSEBL  is  currently  regulated  by  provisions  under  the \nCompanies Act (2000), Securities Exchange Regulation (1993), Control of Brokers Regulations \n(1993),  Listing  Rules  of  RSEBL  (1993),  and  Rules  of  the  Exchange  (1993).  However,  it  is  not \nclear  whether  the  law  allows  RMA  any  enforcement  role  in  the  market  with  respect  to  people \nother than those licensed by it and their affiliates. It cannot compel others to furnish testimony, \ndocuments, or other evidence. \n \n32. \nCurrent securities regulations do not comply with international standards and so require \namendment.  The  most  pressing  areas  are  as  follows:  (i)  setting  out  trading  and  settlement \nprocedures;  (ii)  providing  for  a  proper  matching  of  buyer  and  seller  obligations  for  trade \nsettlement;  (iii)  defining  at  which  point  beneficial  ownership  of  securities  passes  to  enable \ndelivery  versus  payment;  (iv)  written  procedures  for  on-site  inspections  of  RSEBL  by  RMA  as \nwell as inspections of brokers by RSEBL and RMA; (v) issues regarding disclosure of control and \nrelated-party  transactions  and  expanding  remedies  for  defective  disclosure;  (vi)  introducing \ninternal  controls  and  inspections  for  the  depository;  and  (vii) strengthening  documentation \nrequirements in the trading, clearing, and settlement system (i.e., how settlement obligations are \ndetermined). \n\n\fDEVELOPMENT COORDINATION MATRIX \n \n\nTA Title \n\nDescription \n\nProject amount \n\nSector \n\nRegulatory Body \n(RMA) \n\nFunding

The objective of the financial management assessment is to determine \n1. \nwhether \nthe  Financial  Sector \nimplementing  project  components  under \nDevelopment Program (FSDP) have acceptable financial management arrangements and to \nensure that actions required for sound financial management arrangements are taken before \nloan  effectiveness.  The  Financial  Management  and  Accounting  Questionnaire  was \ncompleted  with  the  help  of  staff  of  the  executing  agency  (EA)  and  implementing  agencies \n(IAs).  The  detailed  assessment  and  final  version  of  the  questionnaire  is  in  Supplementary \nAppendix B. \n\n2. \nCountry  Issues.  Financial  management  has  been  improved  by  creating  internal \naudit units in each ministry and the Royal Monetary Authority (RMA) and by separating aid \nmanagement  from  budget  and  accounts.  However,  with  only  10  internal  auditors  in  six \nministries  at  present,  the  capacity  for  internal  auditing  is  not  commensurate  with  growing \nrequirements. \n\nRisk  Analysis.  The  financial  management  risk  of  the  project  arising  from  identified \n\n3. \nweaknesses, together with its mitigating measures, are highlighted in the following table:  \n\nTable A8: Financial Management Risk and Mitigating Measures \n \nRisk Rating \nLow/Medium \n\nRisk Mitigation Measures \n\nRisk \nLimited effectiveness of the \ninternal auditors in government \ndepartments (including the \nMinistry of Finance and Royal \nMonetary Authority) \n\nTarget managers who supervise finances, \nincluding internal controls, receive awareness \ntraining to fully understand the need for internal \ncontrols and give practical effect to these \ninternal controls.  \n \nTarget specialized training for internal auditors \n \n\nOverall Risk Rating \n\nLow/Medium \n \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n4. \nInstitutional  Arrangements.  For  the  program  component  under  the  FSDP,  the \nMinistry of Finance (MOF) will be the EA and IA for two components. RMA will be the IA for \nthe  other  three  components.  MOF  will  form  the  program  steering  committee,  which  will \nprovide  policy  support,  oversee  FSDP  implementation  and  progress,  facilitate  cooperation \nand  coordination  among  all  relevant  agencies,  and  ensure  timely  achievement  of  reform \nactions with respect to the program. A program and project management unit (PMU) will be \nestablished at RMA to coordinate project activities among various IAs.  \n \n5. \nFunds  Flow  Arrangements.  Generally,  for  the  program  loan  component,  the \nDepartment of Aid and Debt Management (DADM) will submit withdrawal applications to the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) that state the fulfilled requirements. Foreign currency for the \namount  requested  will  be  credited  to  RMA\u2019s  foreign  currency  reserves  by  ADB.  A  local \ncurrency  equivalent  will  then  be  credited  in  the  Government  Budget  Fund  (GBF),  which  is \nmaintained by MOF\u2019s Department of Public Accounts (DPA) in Bank of Bhutan Limited. The \nGBF  can  then  be  utilized  for  multiple  purposes  depending  on  the  requirements  of  the \nGovernment.  \n \n6. \nFor the project and technical assistance components, MOF will be the EA and IA for \none project component, RMA will be the IA for the other four components of the project as \nwell  as  the  technical  assistance.  DADM  will  submit  withdrawal  applications  to  ADB.  An \nimprest account specifically for the project will be opened at RMA for ADB funds. RMA will \ninform  DADM  about  receipt  of  ADB  funds  into  the  imprest  account,  which  is  in  foreign \ncurrency.  DADM  will  then  direct  RMA  to  convert  and  transfer  the  requested  amount  in \n\n\f58 \n\nAppendix 8 \n\nequivalent local currency to the GBF maintained by DPA. DADM will advise DPA to release \nfunds  to  IAs  based  on  their  requirements  and  monthly  progress  reports,  i.e.,  specifically \nproject letter of credit accounts (in this case, three letter-of-credit accounts, one for each of \nthe  two  IAs).  The  counterpart  funds  will  also  be  retained  in  the  GBF.  The  PMU  must  ask \nDADM  for  access  to  both  counterpart  and  ADB  funds  in  the  GBF.  The  requisition  forms \nsubmitted  by  the  PMU  will  require  joint  signatures.  One  signatory  will  be  the  managing \ndirector  of  RMA  and  the  other  signatory  either  the  project  director  or  alternate  project \ndirector.  \n \nStaffing Arrangements. The financial management infrastructure of the PMU will be \n7. \nadequate  to  provide  the  requisite  financial  management  arrangements  for  the  project  as \nqualified regular RMA staff will occupy various  positions in the PMU. The program director \nwill be assigned to a senior staff of RMA, and the alternate program director will be assigned \nto the representative from DADM at MOF. The program director will oversee the budgeting, \naccounting, and reporting of all financial transactions relating to project implementation, and \nwill be assisted by the alternate program director and PMU\u2019s accounts and finance officers.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nFigure A1: Program Management Unit Structure \n\nAlternate Program Director \n\nProgram Director \n\nAccounts Officer \n(from Royal Monetary Authority\u2019s \nBanking Division) \n\n \n\nFinance Officer \n(from Royal Monetary Authority\u2019s \nAdministration and Finance \nDivision) \n\n \n       Source: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n8. \nAccounting Policies and Procedures, and Financial Reporting. Cash accounting \nis used by RMA. For MOF, the main accounting records are cash book, journal, and ledger. \nAccountability  rests  on  compliance  with  financial  regulations,  including  disbursement  rules, \nas well as on the noted separation of functions between the controlling officer, drawing and \ndisbursement officer, and accountant. A system of detailed pre-approvals reduces the scope \nfor spending units to divert funds to unapproved purposes.   \n \nAccounting  records  in  the  Financial  Rules  and  Regulations  (2001)  manual  are  kept \n9. \naccording to a chart of accounts that differentiates expenditures by line item, function, and \neconomic  category.  The  financial  manual  explains  the  various  periods  for  which  accounts \nand supporting information must be kept, as well as the conditions under which they are to \nbe kept. The PMU will implement RMA\u2019s accounting processes and procedures, namely the \nExpenditure  Rule  (2000)  and  the  Banking  Manual  (2004),  which  follow  similar  principles \ndescribed above.  \n \n10. \nInformation Systems. MOF\u2019s financial management system has been computerized \nsince  2003  for  standardizing  the  Government\u2019s  budget  and  accounting  system,  but  the \nsystem  cannot  automatically  generate  necessary  project  financial  reports,  which  must  be \nextracted  manually  from  financial  item  codes.  The  PMU  will  implement  RMA\u2019s  information \n\n\fAppendix 8 \n\n59 \n\nsystems for generating reports. Computerization for report generation by RMA will be ready \nby August 2006.   \n \n11. \nAudit  Arrangements.  The  internal  audit  department  at  RMA  reports  directly  to  the \nmanaging director of RMA, while the internal audit department at MOF reports directly to the \nfinance minister and finance secretary. The Financial Rules and Regulations (2001) manual \nprovides  only  simple  advice  on  managers\u2019  responsibility  for  internal  controls  and  identifies \nsome  of  the  main  areas  where  they  are  needed.  As  a  result,  incomplete  internal  controls \narise  due  to  (i)  the  inability  by  managers  to  fully  understand  the  need  for  internal  controls \nand  (ii)  the  failure  of  managers  to  give  them  practical  effect.  Furthermore,  the  internal \nauditors  in  RMA  and  MOF  do  not  hold  recognized  professional  qualifications  such  as \nchartered  public  accountant.  Their  qualifications  are  based  on  experience  and  ad  hoc \ncourses (auditing seminars, etc.).   \n \n12. \nHowever, external audits conducted by the Royal Audit Authority deter irregularities \nand  ensure  basic  financial  accountability.  The  external  audits  of  MOF  and  RMA  are \nconducted  according  to  auditing  standards  of  the  International  Organization  of  Supreme \nAudit Institution. Project accounts will be audited by RMA\u2019s internal auditor and externally by \nthe Royal Audit Authority. The audited project financial statements will be submitted to ADB \nwithin 6 months of the end of the Government\u2019s fiscal year on 30 June.    \n \n13. \nDisbursement Arrangements. The ADB loan of $13 million will be disbursed over a \nperiod of 3 years. Disbursement from the ADB loan will be made in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nLoan  Disbursement  Handbook.  The  imprest  account  procedure  will  be used for  the  project \nloan.  As  eligible  expenditures  are  incurred  and  paid  from  the  account,  the  EA  will  request \nliquidation  or  replenishment  of  the  account  by  submitting  a  withdrawal  application  on  a \nregular basis. Any balance of the advance not liquidated will be promptly refunded to ADB in \nthe currency of the account. \n\n14. \nSupervision Plan. Capacity building and closer supervision will be required initially \nto ensure PMU compliance with the proposed systems as outlined. Normal supervision may \nbe applied later.  \n \n15. \nConclusion  and  Recommendations.  More  detailed  guidance  and  more  intensive \ntraining  for  both  auditors  and  managers  are  required  to  make  the  internal  audit  units  fully \neffective. Many managers currently view their responsibilities primarily as the routine duties \nof authorizing payments, signing requests, and so on. Incomplete understanding of internal \ncontrols may generally influence attitudes toward internal audits, with detrimental effects on \nfinancial  management.  Furthermore,  the  internal  auditors  in  RMA  and  MOF  do  not  hold \nrecognized professional qualifications such as chartered public accountant. \n   \n16. \nNeeds  include  (i)  detailed  guidance  and  more  intensive  training  for  senior  officers \nworking  in  administration  and  finance,  and  other  managers  who  supervise  finances \n(including  internal  auditors)  to  fully  understand  the  need  for  internal  controls  and  to  give \npractical  effect  to  these  internal  controls  and  (ii)  specialized  training  to  enhance  the \nqualifications  and  competency  of \nthe \nGovernment\u2019s financial management by improving qualification in accounting and auditing as \nwell as developing Bhutanese accounting and auditing standards and policies. \n \n17. \nOverall,  the  financial  management  capacities  of  MOF  and  RMA  are  satisfactory  to \nensure  their  smooth  program-executing  and  implementing  functions,  despite  training \nlimitations in auditing and financial management.  Both MOF and RMA have prior experience \nof  successfully  managing  ADB-financed  projects  and  so  know  ADB\u2019s  procedures  and \nfinancial management requirements.  \n\ninternal  auditors.

Recent  governance  reforms  in  Bhutan  have  focused  on \ndevolution,  decentralization,  and  judicial  reforms.  The  role  of  the  legislature  has  been \nenhanced with the establishment of its public finance and public accounts committees and of \nthe legislative committee. Administrative and financial decentralization has meant that more \nauthority and accountability have passed to the districts and village blocks. The Royal Audit \nAuthority  (RAA)  has  been  given  broad  powers  to  ensure  that  public  sector  entities  are \naudited regularly and that their accountability for usage of public funds is assured. While no \nspecifically  identifiable  road  map  for  governance  has  yet  been  put  in  place  in  Bhutan,  the \nbroad  outlines  of  a  core  governance-reform  program  are  captured  in  the  Government\u2019s \nBhutan  2020  vision  document  and  the  National  Poverty  Reduction  Strategy.  The  vision \ndocument  focuses  on  governance  in  regard  to,  among  other  areas,  the  management  of \ndevelopment,  professionalism  in  the  civil  service,  resource  mobilization,  and  development \nfinancing.  \n \n3. \nSector  Specific  Context.  The  finance  sector  in  Bhutan  is  still  at  a  relatively  early \nstage  of  development,  with  only  four  financial  institutions\u2014two  banks  and  two  non-bank \ninstitutions, with the banks holding more than four-fifths of total assets in the financial sector. \nStill,  given  Bhutan\u2019s  impressive  economic  growth  rates  over  time,  the  contribution  of  the \nfinancial  sector  has  substantially  expanded.  The  two  commercial  banks  (Bhutan  National \nBank Limited and Bank of Bhutan Limited) operate at the low-risk end of the market (e.g., by \nrequiring considerable collateral). Their growth (e.g., in assets) is slower than that of the two \nnon-bank  financial  institutions,  with  fewer  nonperforming  loans.  There  is  some  competition \namong  financial  institutions,  but  innovative  financial  products  are  yet  to  be  developed  to \nentice the private sector.  \n \nB. \n \n\nRelevant Issues in the Finance Sector \n\n1. \n\nInstitutional Governance \n\n \n4. \nLegislative  and  Policy  Framework.  The  legislative  basis  of  work  in  the  finance \nsector  is  primarily  contained  in  the  Royal  Monetary  Authority  Act  (1982),  Companies  Act \n(2000),  Bankruptcy  Act  (1999),  the  Financial  Institutions  Act  (1992),  and  the  proposed \nFinancial Services Act (FSA). The FSA has provisions to increase RMA\u2019s autonomy in the \nconduct  of  its  statutory  functions,  both  monetary  and  regulatory;  this  is  said  to  be  in \nalignment  with  Government\u2019s  preference  to  go  slow  towards  a  full  central  bank.  Some \ninternal  structural  changes  at  RMA  have  been  made  recently.  Despite  the  flurry  of  activity \naround drafting the FSA, legal gaps are still thought to exists in the finance sector in Bhutan. \nFor  example,  no  existing  laws  or  regulations  supervise  the  insurance  industry  effectively. \nThis  proposed  sector-development  loan  has  one  component  geared  specifically  for  this \nweakness. \n \n5. \nCapability  Issues.  Across  institutions  in  the  finance  sector  is  a  significant  lack  of \ninstitutional  capacity  building  and  skills  development.  RMA  is  particularly  concerned  about \n\n \n\n\f70 \n\nAppendix 11 \n\nthese capacity constraints in financial institutions and wishes to put considerable emphasis \non building institutional capability in this sector. Capability gaps are evident in such areas as \non-site  inspection,  enforcement  procedures,  management  capability  in  commercial  banks, \ncorporate  governance,  actuarial  evaluation,  internal  auditing,  and  the  loan  review  and \nmonitoring systems. \n \n6. \nRegulatory  Framework.  This  revolves  around  the  role  of  RMA  and  its  use  of  the \nFinancial  Institutions  Act  (1992)  as  a  tool  to  regulate  the  sector.  The  Royal  Insurance \nCorporation  of  Bhutan  Limited  (RICBL)  exercises  a  monopoly  in  insurance  services,  an \nindustry that RMA is not felt to have full capacity to regulate because (i) the FIA (1992) does \nnot  adequately  cover  the  subject  of  insurance  and  (ii)  well-trained  and  well-equipped \nregulatory  personnel  to  regulate  RICBL  are  lacking  in  RMA.  The  Financial  Institutions \nSupervision Division (FISD) of RMA plays a central role in enforcing prudential regulations in \nthe finance sector, but there appears to be no clear rule by which RMA can impose penalties \nfor  non-compliance.  While  penalties  for  any  infraction  of  the  prudential  regulations  are \nclearly laid out in Article 58 of the FIA (1992), to date RMA has not taken any stern action \nagainst any of the financial institutions that have violated regulations. \n \nAccountability. Financial institutions\u2019 accountability to the regulator is governed by \n7. \nthe FIA and to their shareholders by the Companies Act. Financial institutions are required \nto submit periodic reports to RMA on their activities and financial performance, and they are \nalso  subject  to  regular  on-  and  off-site  inspections.  This  accountability  process  is \nstraightforward,  and  neither RMA  nor financial institutions  have raised  any  concerns  about \nthe  process  or  the  stipulations  therein.  As  for  the  accountability  of  the  institutions  to  their \nshareholders, the Companies Act requires them to make available annually several financial \nstatements  including  information  on  the  institution\u2019s  financial  performance  and  significant \nratios  indicating  its  financial  health  and  profitability.  They  are  also  required  to  submit \nindependently  audited  statements  to  shareholders,  including  any  adverse  comments  from \nthe  auditors  and  management\u2019s  response  to  them.  Given  that  the  auditors\u2019  comments \ninclude comments on  any  violations,  it  is  expected  that shareholders have  opportunities  to \nhold management accountable for the institutional financial performance. \n \n \n \n8. \nThe  discussion  of corruption  in the Bhutanese public sector is conditioned  by  there \nhaving  been  no  system-wide  corruption  assessments  or  analyses  conducted  to  date.  No \ncomprehensive external assessments have been done either. What does exist is anecdotal \nevidence  regarding  what  is  generally  perceived  in  the  country.  Funding  agency  reports  on \nsectoral  assessments  point  out  that  the  Bhutanese  public  sector  is  remarkably  free  of \ninstitutional  corruption.  It  is  fair  to say  that  there  is  less  risk  in  Bhutan  of  system-wide  and \ninstitutionalized  corruption  in  the  public  sector  than  of  inefficiencies,  ineffectiveness, \nnegligence, and malfeasance on the part of public servants. RAA audits show that financial \ninstitutions  suffer  from  the  same  types  of  managerial  lapses,  by  and  large,  that  are  in \nevidence  in  other  Government  departments,  including  lapses  in  over-payment,  lack  of \nadherence to specific requirements, etc. \n \nC. \n \n9. \nRisk  Specification.  A  review  of  the  existing  situation  in  the  finance  sector  shows \nfour  categories  of  risk  that  need  to  be  highlighted:  policy-oriented  (such  as  government \ninfluence  in  the  finance  sector),  regulatory  framework  and  capability-related  (such  as  low \ncapability in RMA for supervision), legislation-related (such as a weak regime for anti-money \nlaundering  [AML]  and  combating  the  financing  of  terrorism  [CFT]),  and  standards-related \n(such as weak governance in financial institutions). \n \n\nRisks, Their Severity, and Mitigation Measures \n\nCorruption \n\n2. \n\n\fAppendix 11 \n\n71 \n\n \n\n10. \n \n\nRisk Severity.. A risk severity analysis shows the following types of risks:1 \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n(iv) \n\nType I. Lack of sufficient legal, regulatory, and supervisory framework, delay \nin FSA enactment, and weak governance in financial institutions. \nType  II.  Lack  of  national  accounting  and  auditing  standards,  Government \ninfluence  in  the  finance  sector,  low  capability  in  banks  and  non-banks,  low \ncapability in RMA for supervision, a busy legislative schedule in the National \nAssembly,  lack  of  government  commitment  to  reforms,  and  insufficient \nfinancial information disclosure and reporting requirements. \nType III. Weak AML/CFT regime. \nType IV. None. \n\n \n11. \nOngoing  and  Proposed  Mitigation  Measures  and  Residual  Risks.

Linkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \n \n\n \nIs the sector identified as a national \npriority in country poverty analysis? \n \n\n \n\n \n\n  Yes \n\n    No \n\n \n\nIs the sector identified as a national \npriority in country poverty partnership \nagreement?   \n\n \n Yes \n \n  No \n\n \n\n \n\n                      Targeting Classification: General intervention \n\n \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reducing poverty in Bhutan: \nPrivate sector  development is vital to fostering economic  growth and creating employment opportunities and so \nachieve the development goals of the Ninth Five-Year Development Plan (2002\u20132007). However, as the private \nsector continues to face several constraints because of its small domestic markets, lack of labor, underdeveloped \ninfrastructure, and lack of adequate access to finance, the contribution of the private sector to the gross domestic \nproduct  has  yet  to  become  an  engine  of  economic  growth  or  poverty  reduction  in  Bhutan.  The  Government  of \nBhutan  recognized  the  need  to  develop  the  financial  sector  to  support  private  sector  growth.  Lack  of  access  to \nfinance,  high  interest  rates,  and  high  collateral  requirements  are  recognized  as  significant  drawbacks  for \nentrepreneurs and will be addressed with the objective of recommending means to improve the financial system. \nMore  broadly,  competition  among  financial  institutions  seems  to  be  lacking,  which  hinders  the  development  of \nmore  and  better  financial  products  and  services  such  as  leasing,  venture  capital,  credit  cards,  and  automated \nteller machines. Hence, the technical assistance will review and prepare a strategy to promote competition in the \nfinancial sector. \n \nThe Project will support strengthening the financial system by promoting good governance in banking supervision \nand  insurance  regulation,  building  institutional  capacity,  and  encouraging  financial  competition  by  developing  a \nmore efficient non-bank financial sector. Better financial intermediation provided by an improved financial system, \nincluding the non-bank financial sector, will likely increase the ratio of credit to the private sector as a percentage \nof total financial assets to more than the current 19% and the private sector contribution in manufacturing, trade \nand commerce, and services, as percentage of gross domestic product, from the current 34%. \n \n \nB. Poverty Analysis  \n \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed? \nFinancial  intermediation  and  market  competition  improve  the  efficiency  of  resource  allocation  and  therefore \nenhance  private  sector  competition  and  entrepreneurship.  Greater  financial  development  generates  more \nemployment,  induces  better  innovation,  and  augments  high  economic  productivity  to  provide  benefits  economy \nwide. \n \nThe  social  benefits  will  be  explored  in  aggregate.  In  addition,  financial  development  underpins  private  sector \ndevelopment,  which  is  vital  to  the  economic  growth  of  Bhutan  as  expected  in  the  Ninth  Five-Year  Plan.  Higher \nprivate  sector  development  is  envisaged  to  absorb  the  70,000  new  labor  market  entrants,  stimulate  growth  in \nsmall and medium-sized enterprises, and improve national economic growth. The social and poverty impact will  \nbe  positive,  resulting  from  support  for  reforms  to  specific  financial  services,  products,  and  supervision  and \nregulation for targeted financial sectors, institutions, and/or beneficiaries. \n \n \nC. Participation Process \n \nIs there a stakeholder analysis? \nRoundtable  discussions  will  be  held  with  the  Ministry  of  Finance,  Royal  Monetary  Authority,  Royal  Insurance \nCorporation of  Bhutan,  and  other relevant stakeholders, including multilateral and bilateral organizations. These \nwill ensure the participation of stakeholders in proposing high-quality action plans and recommendations. \n \nIs there a participation strategy? \nDuring  technical  assistance  implementation,  there  will  be  two  or  more  workshops  and  training  sessions.  The \nworkshops and training will secure good representation and participation of key players in the financial sector. \n \n \nD.
