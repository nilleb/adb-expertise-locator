THE PROPOSAL\n\n II. \n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n2.\nSevere  flooding  and  landslides  occurred  in  Tajikistan  as  a  result  of  intense  monsoon\nrains from 6 to 12 July 1999. Damage occurred throughout the country, affecting Leninabad and\nKhatlon  regions,  the  Regions  of  Republican  Subordination  (RRS)  and  the  eastern,  high\nmountain  area  of  Gorno-Badakhshan  Autonomous  Region  (GBAR).  Mountain  streams  and\nrivers  swollen  by  melting  snow  earlier  in  the  year  received  further  inflows  from  the  unusually\nintense  monsoon  rain.  This  resulted  in  massive  slope  failures,  landslides,  and  widespread\nfloods,  which  caused  the  loss  of  20  lives  and  considerable  damage  to  houses,  crops,  farm\nanimals,  roads,  bridges,  associated  riverbank  protection  works,  irrigation  and  water  supply\nnetworks,  drainage,  power  and  telephone  distribution  systems,  schools,  and  other  social  and\nmunicipal facilities (see para. 15).\n\n3.\nThe Government released TJR6 billion (about $4.5 million equivalent) for the immediate\nrelief and urgent rehabilitation works. In addition, in view of the large amount of work to be done\nand budgetary constraints (paras. 10 to 12), the Government requested emergency assistance\nfrom ADB, World Bank, and other international  aid  agencies  to  help  meet  the  requirements of\nthe disaster-affected areas.\n\n4.\nADB received an official request from the Government for emergency assistance on 21\nJuly  1999.  The  Appraisal  Mission1  visiting  Tajikistan  from  17  to  28  August  1999  undertook  a\njoint assessment with the World Bank of the impact of the floods and landslides;2 and prepared\nthe  Emergency  Flood  Rehabilitation  Project  for  possible  ADB  support.  The  Mission  visited\naffected  areas  and  held  discussions  with  the  local  people,  national  and  local  government\nauthorities,  and  representatives  of  various  international  aid  agencies.  This  report  is  based  on\nthe  Mission\u2019s  findings  and  understandings  reached  with  the  Government  and  the  local\nauthorities.\n\nA. \n\nRegional Geography\n\n III.  BACKGROUND\n\nTajikistan  is  bordered  to  the north by  the  Kyrgyz  Republic,  in  the east  by  the People\u2019s\n5.\nRepublic of China, Afghanistan to the south, and in the west by Uzbekistan. The population of\nTajikistan is 6 million; two thirds are ethnic Tajiks, the remainder are mainly of Uzbek, Kyrgyz,\nand  Russian  origin.  Unlike  most  people  of  Central  Asia,  the  Tajiks  and  their  language  are\nPersian in origin and Islam is the dominant religion. Administratively, the country is divided into\nfour  regions,  with  the  central  RRS  being  administered  directly  from  Dushanbe,  which  is  the\n\n                                               \n1 The Appraisal Mission comprised J.F. Brooks, Senior Project Specialist/Mission Leader; A.M. Malik, Senior Project\n\nSpecialist; and B. Hitchcock, Senior Programs Officer.\n\n2 The floods in 1999 were similar to those caused by the highest ever recorded river levels in 1998, which led to the\n\nWorld Bank-financed Emergency Flood Assistant Project.\n\n\f2\n\ncapital and has a population of about 500,000. Apart from the 30 percent of the population living\nin urban areas, the remainder live in over 3,000 small, dispersed rural communities of 100-1,000\npersons where poverty is estimated to exceed 80 percent.\n\nThe economy is based on three key resources: cotton, aluminum, and hydropower. Prior\n6.\nto  independence  in  1991,  trade  was dominated by  interrepublic  transactions  within  the  former\nSoviet Union (FSU). Since independence, trade with non-FSU countries has grown rapidly. The\nindustry sector accounts for 20 percent of the gross domestic product (GDP). The country has\none of the world\u2019s largest aluminum smelters. Hydropower-based light industry comprising small\nfirms is also important. Most firms are operating below capacity due to the civil conflict between\n1991 and 1996,  dependency on  imported  raw  materials,  and  inability  to  compete  efficiently  in\nthe  world  markets.  They  also  suffer  from  remote  location,  transport  problems  and  recent\nweakening of world prices for aluminum. Power supply is provided by separate networks in the\nKhujand and Dushanbe-Khulyab regions, which are connected only through Uzbekistan. While\nhydropower  generated  along  the  Vakhsh  River  is  exported,  its  value  is  exceeded  by  energy\nimports  from  Uzbekistan.  The  energy  deficit  has  a  negative  impact  on  the  overall  balance  of\npayments. Electricity is highly subsidized, as is liquefied petroleum gas fuel, which is the main\nsource of energy for most of the rural population.\n\n7.\nAgriculture contributes about 30 percent to GDP and to export revenues. The  sector  is\nalso  crucial  for  poverty  reduction  as  it  accounts  for  50  percent  of  employment.  Due  to  the\nmountainous  terrain,  arable  land  is  scarce  and  is  restricted  to  the  valleys,  amounting  to  only\n0.05 ha per capita in some densely populated rural areas. However, irrigation serves about 85\npercent of the arable areas, the soils are fertile, and the climate is favorable for growing a wide\nrange of agricultural produce. Cotton, the main crop, occupies 40 percent of the irrigated area,\nand  along  with  fruit  and  tobacco  accounts  for  most  agricultural  exports.  Agricultural  imports\ninclude machinery, fuel, animal feed, and fertilizers.  Because of the small size and isolation of\nrural  settlements,  Tajikistan  has  a  tradition  of  household  farming.  The  sustenance  of  poverty-\naffected rural households is therefore ameliorated by household garden production.\n\n8.\nTransport problems are acute due to the long distances products have to travel to reach\nmarkets.  Road  transport  accounts  for  over  80  percent  of  freight  and  virtually  all  passenger\ntraffic,  and  uses  a  29,000  km  network.  The  450  km  rail  network  is  the  only  other  significant\ntransport  mode.  Traffic  has  contracted  significantly  since  1991  due  to  the  civil  unrest  and\neconomic  decline,  and  there  is  virtually  no  maintenance  of  assets  due  to  the  scarcity  of\nresources. The same problems face the telecommunications sector. Most equipment is obsolete\nalthough  cellular  phone  services  are  now  available  within  Dushanbe.  The  transport  and\ncommunications networks have also suffered from severe dislocation due to the civil unrest  to\n1996 and the series of disastrous floods.\n\nOver 90 percent of the total 143,100  square  kilometer  land  mass  is  mountainous;  high\n9.\nsnow-covered ranges with impassable  roads for  eight  months  of  the  year separate Leninabad\nRegion from the central and southern regions, while the remote Pamir ranges in GBAR contain\nseveral  of  the  world\u2019s  highest  mountains.  The  climate  is  continental  with  incursions  of\nsubtropical air during the summer months. Monsoon rains, melting snow, and steep valleys give\nrise to seasonal flooding and landslides. Channels are typically braided and changeable in the\nlower  portions of  the  main  river  basins. While  Tajikistan  is  also  prone  to  severe  earthquakes,\nerosion-prone  slopes  and  increased  bed  and  suspended  load  of  the  fast-flowing  rivers  have\nworsened  ever  since  the  country  became  independent,  thereby  increasing  poverty  and\ndeforestation of the steep hillsides, mainly for firewood.\n\n\fB.\n\nRecent Economic Developments3\n\n3\n\n10.\nAt  independence  in  1991,  Tajikistan  was  the  poorest  republic  of  the  FSU.  Although\nindicators of human development were high, they  were  primarily  attributable to a  social  safety\nnet  system  and  full  employment  policy  financed  by  large  transfers  from  Moscow.  Since\nindependence,  the  civil  conflict,  economic  collapse,  and  natural  disasters  have  adversely\naffected the economy. The GDP fell by more than 55 percent between 1991 and 1997. GDP per\ncapita  in  1997  was  estimated  at  only  $178.  In  addition,  the  civil  conflict  resulted  in  resources\nbeing  diverted  from  needed  investments  in  the  social,  municipal,  and  infrastructure  sectors.\nAbout 40 percent of the country\u2019s 6 million inhabitants were directly affected by the civil conflict,\nincluding 50,000 lost lives and over 500,000 who fled or emigrated to other countries. The civil\nconflict  also  resulted  in  major  damage  to  about  35,000  homes  and  a  wide  range  of  public\ninfrastructure.  The  situation  was  exacerbated  by  a  series  of  earthquakes  and  floods  in  the\n1990s, with the most severe floods on record occurring in 1998.\n\n11.\nAfter six years of crisis, following the signing of a peace accord in June 1997 to end the\ncivil  conflict,  the economy  began  to  recover.  The  gradual  improvement  in  the  macroeconomic\nsituation over the past two years has encouraged the Government to focus more on stimulating\neconomic  growth  and  reducing  poverty.  In  1996,  the  Government  embarked  on  an  economic\nstabilization  program,  supported  by  the  International  Monetary  Fund  under  a  standby\narrangement, together with postconflict  emergency assistance  during  1997-1998, and a  three-\nyear  enhanced  structural  adjustment  facility  approved  in  June  1998.  In  1998,  real  GDP\nincreased by 5.3 percent and monthly inflation declined to 2.7 percent. Price  liberalization  has\nbeen  virtually  completed;  a  liberal  trade  and  exchange  rate  system  is  being  established;  and\ninitial  steps  have  been  taken  toward  privatization,  and  legal  and  banking  reforms.  However,\nexternal  shocks  such  as  the  Russian  Federation\u2019s  economic  crisis  and  weak  world  prices  for\ncotton  and  aluminum  make  it  difficult  to  sustain  economic  performance  in  1999.  The  budget\nposition  remains  weak  and  limits  the  Government\u2019s  spending  on  disaster  rehabilitation.\nNevertheless,  Tajikistan\u2019s  medium-term  economic  prospects  appear  promising.  The  progress\nmade on macroeconomic stabilization and structural reform has laid the basis for the country\u2019s\neconomic  recovery.  GDP  is  projected  to  grow  by  4  percent  annually  in  1999-2001,  driven\nprimarily  by a  recovery  in  agriculture and  continued  growth of the  service  sector.  Hydropower\nand mining output are also expected to increase. Despite this, unemployment and poverty  will\nremain major concerns over the medium term.\n\n12.\nRestoring  fiscal  balance  constitutes  one  of  the  main  elements  of  the  Government\u2019s\nmacroeconomic  stabilization  program.  Besides  instituting  fundamental  tax  reforms,  the\nGovernment has been making strenuous efforts to further  rationalize  expenditures,  strengthen\ntax  collection  and  administration,  and  improve  the  budget  process.  There  are  inherent\nweaknesses,  however,  in  the  tax  administration  and  budget  systems.  These  are  being\naddressed with the help of the International Monetary Fund and other agencies, but the results\nwill only be apparent in the medium term. In the short run, the Government\u2019s focus has been on\nreducing  public  expenditure,  which  has  constrained  the  availability  of  funds  for  social  sectors\nand public infrastructure. The Government\u2019s fragile fiscal situation has been further strained by\nthe unforeseen expenditures from the severe flooding and landslides that occurred in April-May\n1998 and July 1999.\n\n13.\nAs  part  of  the  international  assistance  needed  to  promote  economic  recovery,  ADB\napproved a program loan in 1998.4 The first $10 million tranche was released in December 1998\n\n                                               \n3 For details see IN.253-98: Economic Report and Interim Operational Strategy for Tajikistan, 9 November.\n\n\f4\n\nto support structural reform of the transport and power sectors. The reform involves institutional\nand  policy  changes  to  move  from  a  centrally  planned  economy  to  a  market-driven  economy.\nParallel to the program loan, an advisory TA was approved.5 This was followed in March 1999\nby  a  project  preparatory  TA  for  the  rehabilitation  of  roads.6  The  World  Bank  approved  a  $5\nmillion  loan  in  January  1998  for  the  Postconflict  Emergency  Reconstruction  Project  to\nrehabilitate damaged infrastructure, and another loan for $5 million in response to the April-May\n1998 floods, for the Emergency Flood Assistance Project (EFAP) in August 1998.\n\n A.\n\nDescription of the Damage\n\n IV.  DETAILS OF THE DISASTER\n\nThe  flooding  and  landslides  of  July  1999  caused  substantial  damage  throughout\n14.\nTajikistan. ADB, the national and local government authorities, and a World Bank mission jointly\nassessed the damage caused to public infrastructure. The damage was due to floodwaters and\nland/mudslides; both were caused by exceptionally heavy rains and were interrelated. Flooding\nresulted  from  rivers  and  streams  breaking  their  banks  because  they  could  not  carry  the\nincreased load of silt and volume of water. For example, in Asht District in Leninabad  Region,\nmudslides and raging floodwaters resulted from saturation of soils that partly liquefied and slid\nor  flowed  down  steep  slopes  and  through  narrow  valleys.  These  swept  aside  village  houses,\nadjacent  roads,  municipal  water  supply,  and  power  distribution  systems,  and  filled  river\nchannels  with  large  boulders  and  debris.  Peak  flood  flows  in  the  mountain  streams  often\nresulted from landslides temporarily damming streams and then bursting, releasing the trapped\nwater.  It  is  also  apparent  that  some  bridges  were  inappropriately  designed,  without  sufficient\ncross-sectional  open  area  or  adequate  foundations  to  withstand  the  exceptional  and  erosive\nflood flows, estimated  to  have  a 50-year  return  period.  In  some  parts  of  Leninabad  Region,  it\nwas estimated that over 400 millimeter (mm) of rain fell in a nine-hour period, an intensity never\npreviously  recorded.  Inadequate  and  obsolete  rain  and  stream  recording  instruments  and\nmodeling, and other deficient resources, prevented a well-documented account of the conditions\nthat led to the flood. These deficiencies also contributed to the lack of adequate warning to the\npopulation, especially in remote areas. However, the Ministry of Environment has conducted a\npostassessment based on analysis  of  the  sparse  data  and  regional  information  gathered from\nthe World Meteorological Organization, of which Tajikistan is a recent member.\n\n15.\nA summary of the damage to private and public infrastructure throughout the country is\nin Appendix 1. The total cost of the damage  is conservatively estimated  at $25  million. Of the\nprivate infrastructure, about 1,000 houses were destroyed or badly damaged, especially  those\nbuilt with clay brick walls that disintegrated in the water. Approximately 14,000 ha of crops and\nover 2,000 farm animals  were  lost.  In  Asht  District  in  Leninabad  Region,  288  households  are\nbeing  resettled  in  safer  areas.  Of  the  public  infrastructure,  about  400  km  of  roads,  over  700\nlinear  m  of  bridges,  and  nearly  60  km  of  related  riverbank  protection  works  were  seriously\ndamaged.  In  addition,  about  80  km  of  irrigation  channels,  100  ha  of  irrigation  headworks,\nassociated pumps, approximately 10 km of water supply channels, 40 km of power distribution\nlines, about 50 electrical transformers, 17 km of telephone networks, and 5  schools  were also\nseriously damaged.\n\n                                                                                                                                                      \n4 Loan 1651-TAJ: Postconflict Infrastructure Program, for $20 million, approved on 10 December 1998.\n5  TA  3114-TAJ:  Institutional Strengthening of the Transport and Energy Sectors,  for  $1.5  million,  approved  on  10\n\nDecember 1998.\n\n6 TA 3168-TAJ: Road Rehabilitation Project, for $840,000, approved on 1 March 1999.\n\n\fB. \n\nImpact of the Damage\n\n5\n\n16.\nThe  flood-caused  damage  has  worsened  the  misery  of  the  poor  living  in  the  flood-\naffected areas, especially in the Asht District where widespread destruction of houses, and loss\nof farmland and  livestock occurred.  Many families  have  also  lost  their  assets,  and  damage  to\npublic  infrastructure  has  deprived  them  of  basic  needs  such  as  access  to  markets,  health\nservices,  drinking  water,  electricity,  irrigation,  and  education.  The  risk  of  disease  under  these\nconditions  is  high,  and  the  light  tents  provided  under  relief  assistance  will  not  be  suitable\naccommodation for the approaching winter.\n\n17.\nIt is essential to restore road access in the flood-affected areas for the  supply  of  basic\ncommodities.  Furthermore,  many  of  the  temporary  repairs  undertaken  on  landslides  and\nwashouts are vulnerable to damage from further rain. Even normal rain will isolate communities,\nand deprive them of access to vital food, medical supplies, and electricity. Electricity has been\nrestored to most communities using makeshift power lines, but such power lines strung across\nmudslides and through riverbeds are vulnerable. Communities will suffer great hardship during\nthe  approaching  winter  without  heated  water.  Because  water  supply  systems  are  extremely\nimportant to the health of the people, damage to these piped systems places people in affected\nareas at a very high risk of disease. Prompt action by authorities, by effecting temporary repairs\nand  using  disinfectants,  has  so  far  prevented  outbreaks  of  disease.  Rebuilding  of  schools  is\nprogressing,  but  some  are  still  not  ready.  Since  the  new  school  year  began  in  September,\neducation  has  experienced  a  serious  setback.  Replacement  of  furniture  and  equipment  is  a\nnecessary part of the rebuilding, as is cleaning and refurbishing playgrounds and sports areas.\nDamage  to  municipal  buildings  has  included  losses  of  important  records  and  damage  to\nbuildings,  furniture,  and  equipment,  all  of  which  are  necessary  to  continue  normal  municipal\nfunctions. Although damage to telephone facilities is only a small proportion of the total damage\ncost,  it  affects  a  vital  component  that  requires  more  than  the  makeshift  repairs.  It  is  also\nessential to  restore  the  damage  to  river  courses  and  irrigation  facilities  which,  if  not  repaired,\ncould disrupt irrigated food-crop cycles, and cause further flood damage due to raised riverbed\nlevels and changed river courses.\n\nC.\n\nGovernment Response\n\n18.\nThe representatives of the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Emergency Situations and\nCivil  Defense  (MESCD),  and  the  Prime  Minister\u2019s  Office,  as  well  as  of  line  ministries  and\nconcerned local governments, mobilized government resources to restore essential services in\nthe  worst  hit  areas  and  allocated  land  for  the  establishment  of  two  resettlement  centers.  The\nwork was well organized, and by the end of July 1999, many essential services including road\naccess, water, and electricity had been  restored  to  most  communities, albeit  temporarily.  This\nwas a considerable achievement considering the widespread nature of the disaster, the difficult\nterrain, and continuing heavy rain through July.  Voluntary work from the affected communities\nhas also played an important part in the recovery, particularly in public buildings and in cleaning\nout and repainting flood-affected schools.\n\nThe local authorities decided that two flooded communities in Asht District faced too high\n19.\na  risk  from  further  flooding  and  288  households  are  being  resettled  to  safer  areas.  The\nconstruction of two resettlement centers (residential developments with homestead gardens for\neach  dwelling,  serviced by  roads,  water,  and  electricity)  commenced almost  immediately  after\nthe floods with Government financing. Funds were allocated to the resettlement centers so that\nthe  affected  residents  can  be  housed  before  the  onset  of  winter.  The  Government  was  also\nquick to initiate a cash compensation package for the affected families.\n\n\fD.\n\nAid Coordination and External Assistance\n\n6\n\n20.\nThe  response  of  the  aid  community  to  the  July  1999  floods  and  landslides  has  been\nmainly for relief assistance (Table 1) and is being coordinated by the United Nations Office for\nthe Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA). The United States Agency for International\nDevelopment  and  Germany,  through  German  Agro  Action,  are  providing  further  grant\nassistance,  especially  for  providing  shelter  to  those  households  whose  homes  were  totally\ndestroyed. A number of nongovernment organizations (NGOs) are also providing assistance by\nproviding  relief  goods  and  arranging  for  disaster  preparedness  and  training,  including  in  local\ncommunities.\n\nTable 1: Summary of Relief Assistance for the 1999 Floods in Tajikistan\n\nOrganization\n\nNature of Assistance\n\nHumanitarian Assistance (from the United States)\n\nGerman Agro Action\nInternational Committee of the Red Cross and\nInternational Federation of the Red Cross\n\nMedecins Sans Frontieres (Netherlands)\nRelief International\nUnited Nations Children\u2019s Fund\n\nUnited States Agency for International Development\nWorld Food Program\n\nTents,  mats,  water  boilers,  cauldrons,  cutlery,\nbuckets, tarpaulins, kettles\nFlour, vegetable oil, salt, food parcels, shelter\nBlankets, tents, bed linen,  pillows,  mats,  picks,\nshovels,  cooking  sets,  soap,  used  clothing,\nfood parcels\nDispensary kits, soap, fuel\nMedicines\nSurgical \neducational  materials,  water \nemergency kits\nShelter materials\nFood parcels\n\nkits,  water  purification \n\ntablets,\ncontainers,\n\nThe World Bank received a request for emergency assistance from the Government at\n21.\nabout the same time as ADB. The ADB and World Bank response has been closely coordinated\nfrom  the  very  start.  The  World  Bank  sent  a  mission  to  Tajikistan  concurrently  with  the  ADB\nMission.  Taking  into  account  ADB\u2019s  operational  experience  in  public  infrastructure  and  the\nsimilar range of assistance being provided by the World Bank under the ongoing EFAP, it was\nagreed  that  a  geographic  and  sector  arrangement  be  adopted  in  coordinating  the  relative\nfinancing arrangements. The proposed Project focuses on a wide range of public infrastructure\nin  Leninabad  Region, anticipated  nonconflict  areas  of  the  RRS,  and  those  districts  of  Khatlon\nRegion where the World Bank is not involved. Using EFAP supplementary financing, the World\nBank will mainly concentrate on those districts of Khatlon Region already being assisted under\nthe EFAP. Consistent with the EFAP, the scope of the World Bank intervention will be for roads,\nbridges, riverbank protection, and power facilities.\n\n22.\nADB presented its assessment of the damage caused by the floods and landslides in the\naffected  regions at a  special  coordination  meeting  of  local  representatives  of  international  aid\nagencies  and  NGOs  convened  by  UNOCHA  in  Dushanbe.  The  meeting  confirmed  the  extent\nand seriousness of the damage and noted the participants\u2019 support of the Government's request\nfor  additional  assistance  to  the  main  affected  areas  of  the  country.  The  United  Nations\nDevelopment  Programme,  UNOCHA  and  NGOs  agreed  that  the  proposed  ADB  TA,  both  for\nflood disaster management as well as possible longer-term assistance for a flood management\nplan, was important (para. 52). Coordination of the NGOs by the United  Nations  Development\nProgramme, and general coordination of aid assistance, including ADB and World Bank project\nactivities by UNOCHA, will be essential for sustainable flood rehabilitation in the country.\n\n\fE. \n\nLessons Learned\n\n7\n\n23.\nThe Project draws on experience gained by  ADB  in  providing  emergency  rehabilitation\nassistance loans. Although such loans have been extended relatively infrequently relative to the\nnumber  of  disasters  that  have  occurred  in  Asia  and  the  Pacific,  ADB  has  responded  quickly\nwhere the sale of damage  is beyond developing  member  countries  capacity to handle. Based\non a review of the performance of these emergency assistance loans, some important lessons\nhave been learned that will be useful for designing similar projects in the future: (i) delays have\noccurred  in  the  procurement  and  engagement  of  consultants;  and  (ii)  inadequate  quality  of\nworks  was  observed  in  some  cases.  Delays  occurred  for  various  reasons  including  weak\ninstitutional  capacity  and  shortage  of  technical  and  managerial  skills  in  the  implementing\nagencies, as well as inadequate familiarity with procedures for  the  release of funds.  Delays  in\nconsultant  recruitment  and  procurement  have  unduly  prolonged  project  implementation\nschedules. In some cases, inadequate quality control has seriously affected both the expected\nlife of the completed project facilities and capacity for withstanding further disasters.\n\nThese  lessons  were  taken  into  consideration  in  designing  the  Project.  Particular\n24.\nattention was given to the implementation arrangements, in defining clearly the responsibilities\nand functions  of  the  concerned  agencies,  and  utilizing  and  building  on  the  experience  gained\nunder  the  World  Bank\u2019s  EFAP.  To  avoid  implementation  delays,  advance  action,  retroactive\nfinancing,  and  simple  arrangements  for  procurement  and  the  recruitment  of  domestic\nconsultants  were approved.  An  international  consultant  recruited  under  the  associated  TA  will\ncarry out capacity building in the Government\u2019s disaster agencies to ensure sustainable design,\nimprove the quality and efficiency of disaster management, and enhance coordination with the\naid  community  and  NGOs.  In  addition,  the  Government  has  ensured  adequate  provision  of\nbudget and personnel for proper maintenance of project facilities after completion. The need for\nadditional TA was also discussed with the Government, and a request has been made to ADB\nand  World  Bank  for  urgent  support  in  developing  a  long-term  flood  management  plan.  This\nfuture TA is expected to help the Government better manage the impact of floods, and improve\nnatural disaster preparedness, as well as the overall long-term coordination of disaster project\nimplementation in the country.\n\nA.\n\nRationale\n\n V.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT\n\nThe  floods  and  landslides  of  July  1999  caused  significant  damage  to  public\n25.\ninfrastructure. There is an urgent need to help the Government cope with the disaster, given its\nbudgetary constraints, which are expected to  continue  over  the  medium  term.  The  Project  will\nassist  the  Government  to  (i)  rehabilitate  public  infrastructure  in  the  affected  areas;  and\n(ii) mitigate  the  risk  that  these  expenditures  could  disrupt  the  Government\u2019s  macroeconomic\nstabilization  and  postconflict  development  program.  In  line  with  ADB\u2019s  policy  to  support  the\nrehabilitation efforts of its  developing  member  countries  after  they are  struck by disasters, the\nproposed emergency loan will enable Tajikistan to continue with development expenditures that\notherwise would have been diverted for disaster rehabilitation.\n\n26.\nExtensive  field  visits  were  undertaken  in  the  disaster-affected  areas.  The  Project  was\nformulated  in  close  consultation  with  local  government  officials,  the  affected  communities,\nNGOs, and local groups. Due care was taken in the design of the Project to ensure a significant\nrole  for  the  concerned  regional  and  district  authorities,  including  their  participation  in  project\nimplementation.\n\n\f8\n\nB. \n\nObjectives\n\nC.\n\nScope\n\n27.\nThe immediate objective of the Project is to help  restore public  infrastructure  damaged\nby  the  severe  floods  and  landslides  in  those  areas  of  the  country  that  were  hit  hardest.  The\nlong-term objective of the Project is to reduce poverty, as it will help rehabilitate the poor in the\nflood-affected areas on a sustainable basis.\n\n28.\nDamage in seven districts of Leninabad Region, seven districts of Khatlon Region, and\nseven  districts  of  the  RRS  and  GBAR  will  be  rehabilitated  under  the  Project  based  on  the\npriorities  established  jointly  with  the  national  and  local  government  authorities  and  the  World\nBank  (Map).7  The  TA  provided  in  conjunction  with  the  Project  will  support  capacity building  in\nflood  disaster  management.  The  Project  comprises  the  following  components,  the  details  of\nwhich may be adjusted during implementation (see Appendix 2).\n\n(i)\n\n(ii) \n\n(iii)\n\n(iv)\n\n(v)\n\nCivil Works. The main civil works for the rehabilitation or replacement of\n81 km of  priority  roads, 300  m of bridges, 38  km  of  riverbank  protection\nworks, 47 km of irrigation channels and 52 ha of irrigation headworks will\nbe provided, along with minor municipal civil works for the reconstruction\nof 17 km of water supply networks, 37 km of power distribution lines, and\n17 km of telephone lines, and 5 schools.\n\nConstruction  Materials.  Construction  materials  will  comprise  sand,\nstones,  bitumen,  reinforcing  steel,  cement,  fuel  and  lubricating  oil,\ndrainage  and  sewer  pipes,  poles  and  towers,  electrical  and  telephone\ncables, school building materials, and fittings.\n\nEquipment.  Damaged  irrigation and  water  supply  pumps,  meters, and\nregulators,  electric  power  transformers,  telephones,  and  fittings  will  be\nreplaced  as  well  as  school  furniture,  educational  equipment,  and\ntextbooks.\n\nResettlement.  Public  infrastructure  to  be  provided  comprises  access\nroads,  power,  water  supply,  and  a  school  at  two  resettlement  areas  for\n288 households in the Asht District of Leninabad Region.\n\nConsulting  Services.  A  total  of  about  290  person-months  of  domestic\nconsulting  services  will  be  provided  for  design  review,  construction\nsupervision,  quality  control,  and  environment  and  social \nimpact\nmonitoring.  Training  will  be  provided  by  the  TA  consultant  or  under\nfellowships  for  government  bodies  and  community  groups  in  disaster\nproject management.\n\nD.\n\nCost Estimates\n\n29.\nThe  Project  is  estimated  to  cost  $6.25  million  equivalent,  of  which  $3.25  million  (52\npercent)  is  the  foreign  exchange  cost  and  $3.00  million  equivalent  (48  percent)  the  local\n\n                                               \n7  The  World  Bank  will  focus  on  nine  districts  in  Khatlon  Region  and  two  districts  in  the  RRS  under  the  EFAP\n\nsupplementary financing of $2 million.\n\n\f9\n\n700\n1,530\n420\n180\n70\n\n140\n160\n3,200\n\ncurrency  cost.  The  cost  estimates  include  land  acquisition  and  compensation  for  resettled\npersons and physical and price contingencies, and are net of taxes and duties. A  summary  of\nthe cost estimates is in Table 2 and a detailed cost estimates are in Appendix 3.\n\nTable 2: Summary of Project Cost Estimates\n($\u2019000)\n\nSector\n\nForeign\nExchange\n\nLocal\nCurrency\n\nA.

The provision of local cost financing is justified on country and\nproject  considerations  (paras.  12  and  27).  The  Government  will  meet  the  remaining  local\ncurrency costs of $1.25 million equivalent, or 20 percent  of  the total project  cost. Government\nfinancing  will  cover  the  local  expenditures  for  land  acquisition,  compensation  of  resettled\npersons,  taxes,  and  duties,  and  48  percent  of  civil  works  costs.8  The  Borrower  will  be  the\nRepublic of Tajikistan. The Government will make the loan proceeds available to the Executing\nAgency through budgetary appropriations. The loan will be provided from ADB\u2019s Special Funds\nresources and will have a term of 32 years, and an interest charge of 1 percent per year during\nthe  grace  period  of  eight  years  and  1.5  percent  per  year  thereafter.  The  financing  plan  is\nsummarized in Table 3.\n\nTable 3: Financing Plan\n($ \u2018000)\n\nSource\n\nADB\nGovernment\n     Total\n\nForeign\nExchange\n\nLocal\nCurrency\n\nTotal\n\nPercent\n\n3,250\n0\n3,250\n\n1,750\n1,250\n3,000\n\n5,000\n1,250\n6,250\n\n80\n20\n100\n\n                                               \n8 Civil works comprises labor, equipment operation, site preparation, and other items not covered under construction\n\nmaterials, equipment, and resettlement costs.\n\n\f10\n\nF.\n\nImplementation Arrangements\n\n1. \n\nExecution and Coordination\n\nThe Project will utilize the arrangements already established by the Government for the\n31.\nWorld Bank\u2019s EFAP (Appendix 4). The Executing Agency will be the Department of Environment\nand Emergency Situations (DEES), which is headed by a vice prime minister. The Implementing\nAgency will be the Center for the Liquidation of the Consequences of Natural Disaster (CLCND).\nIts director, who reports to the head of the DEES, will be the project director for both the Project\nand  the  EFAP.  A  full-time  CLCND  deputy  director  will  be  accountable  for  day-to-day  project\nimplementation  as  head  of  the  project  implementation  unit.  The  unit,  which  will  be  located  in\nDushanbe,  will  (i)  review  designs  prepared  by  the  Government\u2019s  design  offices,  prepare  and\nevaluate tenders, award civil works contracts, and procure materials, and equipment; (ii) recruit\nand  supervise  domestic  consultants;  (iii)  supervise  implementation  and  quality  control  of  the\nproject  works  and  equipment  installation;  (iv)  ensure  feedback  from  beneficiaries  on  project\nresponsiveness to their needs; and (v) prepare the various reports to and communications with\nADB.\n\nThe  recently  approved  ADB-financed  Social  Sector  Rehabilitation  Project9  will  engage\n32.\nthe  United  Nations  Office  for  Project  Services  as  implementing  agency  for  construction\nsupervision;  this  is  to  avoid  the  risks  associated  with  the  Government\u2019s  lack  of  experience  in\nproviding  the  needed  support  for  internationally  funded  projects.  However,  CLCND  was\nspecifically established to deal with natural disaster rehabilitation and while CLCND was slow in\nstarting the World Bank-financed EFAP, it is now performing satisfactorily after more than one\nyear of experience. The majority of the civil works  and  equipment  installation  under  the EFAP\nand  the  proposed  Project  are  on  a  force  account  or  direct  purchase  basis  using  experienced\nGovernment  construction  units  under  the  supervision  of  well-qualified  domestic  consultants,\nincluding  a  team  of  accountants  recruited  for  the  EFAP.  The  operational  procedures  and\ncapacity of the EFAP accounting team were recently reviewed and strengthened by the World\nBank, and the team\u2019s performance is satisfactory.\n\n33.\nBenefiting from the satisfactory experience under the EFAP, the head of the PIU will be\nsupported  in  supervising  construction  of  the  Project  by  a  team  of  ADB-financed  domestic\nconsultants  in  Dushanbe  and  field  engineers  in  the  affected  districts  of  Leninabad  Khatlon,\nRRS, and GBAR. Because of the distance between Leninabad Region and Dushanbe, a project\nsupervisor  will  coordinate  with  two  field  engineers  in  Khojand  (see  Map).  Provision  of  the\nadditional PIU resources for  CLCND  will  avoid  the  risk of overburdening the entity.  To  ensure\neffective use of advance procurement action and retroactive financing, appointment of the PIU\nhead and the project supervisor in Khojand is a condition for loan negotiations.\n\n2. \n\nConsulting Services\n\n34.\nAbout 290 person-months of  domestic  consulting  services financed from  ADB  loan  will\nbe  required  to  implement  the  Project.  As  the  EFAP  experience  of  the  World  Bank  indicates,\nadequately  qualified  and  experienced  domestic  consultants  are  available  for  these  relatively\nsimple  works.  The  consultants  will  carry  out  detailed  design  review  in  cooperation  with  the\nGovernment\u2019s design institutes, prepare contract documents, conduct bid evaluations, supervise\nconstruction,  perform  quality  control,  and  prepare  the  covenanted  project  reports.  Field\nengineers  will  be  responsible  for  day-to-day  supervision  of  the  various  contractors.  The\n\n                                               \n9 Loan 1705-TAJ: Social Sector Rehabilitation Project, for $20 million, approved on 26 October 1999.\n\n\f11\n\nMission\u2019s  initial  social  analysis  will  be  reviewed  by  two  social  analysts  who  will  also  gather\nbaseline  data,  and  carry  out  benefit  monitoring  for  the  Project,  in  close  coordination  with  an\ninternational  consultant  disaster  management  expert  recruited  under  the  TA  grant.  The  social\nanalysts  will  also  review  the  Government\u2019s  Resettlement  Plan  for  the  288  families  in  Asht\nDistrict  being  relocated by  the  Government  to  safer areas.  The  resettlement  is  on  a  voluntary\nbasis  and  not  covered  under  ADB\u2019s  policy  on  involuntary  resettlement.  Nevertheless,  it  is  an\nopportunity  to  develop  an  understanding  with  the  Government  on  ADB\u2019s  perspectives  on  the\nsocial  aspects  of  project  design.  The  environment  specialist  will  ensure  that  the  mitigation\nmeasures outlined in the initial environmental examination are followed  and that  the  Project  is\nimplemented in line with the Government\u2019s and ADB\u2019s environmental assessment requirements\nfor  each  project  area.  The  environment  specialist  will  also  ensure  that,  if  necessary,  a  full\nenvironmental  impact  assessment  (EIA)  and  a  summary  EIA  will  be  prepared  for  any  of  the\nproject sites.\n\n35.\nThe domestic consultants will be recruited by the Government as individual consultants\nin  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines on the Use of Consultants  and  other  arrangements\nsatisfactory to ADB on the engagement of domestic consultants. The terms of reference for the\nconsulting services are in Appendix 5.\n\n3.\n\nProcurement\n\n36.\nProcurement  of  goods  and  services  to  be  financed  by  ADB  will  be  carried  out  in\naccordance  with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement.  In  view  of  the  nature  of  the  Project,  with\ncivil works contract values well below $1 million and project sites scattered in remote areas with\nsecurity  risks,  it  is unlikely  that  the Project  will  attract  international  contractors.  The  only  local\ncontractors  in  Tajikistan  with  adequate  experience  and  resources  to  undertake  the  main  civil\nworks for roads, bridges and riverbank protection, and irrigation works are the two State-owned\nenterprises  Mostospetsstroi for  bridges  and  Tajikdorstroy  for  roads.    Both  enterprises  operate\nunder the supervision of the Ministry of  Transport  and  Roads.  These enterprises  are  currently\nengaged  under  the  EFAP  and  their  performance  is  satisfactory.  As  such,  ADB  agreed  to  the\nGovernment\u2019s request for these two firms to carry out the main  civil  works on  a force  account\nbasis. Minor civil works for irrigation, water supply, power and telephone systems, and schools,\nand for the procurement of construction materials and equipment will be carried out on a local\ncompetitive bidding or direct purchase basis, consistent with the EFAP. Most of these contract\npackages are expected to have a  value  of  less  than  $100,000.  The  contract  packages  are  in\nAppendix 6.\n\n4.\n\nAdvance Procurement Action and Retroactive Financing\n\n37.\nFollowing  the  Government\u2019s  request,  ADB  has  approved  (i)  advance  action  for  the\nrecruitment of the consultants for construction supervision, (ii) advance action on  procurement\nof equipment and civil works under the Project, and (iii) retroactive financing under the Project.\nThese actions are required to expedite project implementation particularly for components that\nare  critical for  restoring normalcy  in  the  social  and  economic  life  of  the  affected  communities.\nThe retroactive financing is limited to loan-related expenditures incurred from 8 July 1999 until\nloan effectiveness, and is subject to a maximum of $1.0 million. The Government was advised\nthat  ADB\u2019s  approval  of  advance  action  and,  in  principle,  retroactive  financing  does  not  imply\ncommitment to finance the Project.\n\n\f12\n\n5. \n\nDisbursement Procedures\n\n38.\nTo expedite implementation of the Project through timely release of the loan proceeds,\nthe Government will establish an imprest account promptly after loan effectiveness with an initial\ndeposit  of  $0.5  million.  The  imprest  account  will  be  established  in  the  National  Bank  of\nTajikistan,  and  will  be  managed  and  liquidated  in  accordance  with  detailed  arrangements\nagreed upon by the Borrower and ADB, consistent with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook.\nADB\u2019s statement of expenditures procedure will be used for reimbursement of expenditures and\nfor the liquidation of the imprest account for payments not exceeding $50,000 each. Based on\nexperience under  the  EFAP and a  recent World Bank  review of  CLCND\u2019s  accounting  system,\nthe  Government  has  the  capacity  to  maintain  an  imprest  account  and  expenditure  record  in\naccordance with generally accepted accounting standards.\n\n6.\n\nImplementation Schedule\n\n39.\nThe  Project  will  be  implemented  over  a  period  of  about  two  years,  with  completion\nexpected  by  31  December  2001.  Except  for  the  main  civil  works  for  roads,  bridges,  and\nriverbank  protection,  the  other  components  are  expected  to  be  completed  during  2000.  A\ntentative project implementation schedule is in Appendix 7.\n\n7. \n\nReports, Accounts, and Audit\n\n40.\nThe Government will provide brief monthly and annual reports to ADB. These reports will\nindicate  the  progress  made  and  problems  encountered  during  the  period  under  review,  the\nsteps taken  or proposed  to  remedy  the  problems,  the proposed program of activities,  and  the\nexpected progress during the following period. Within three months of physical completion of the\nProject,  the  Government  will  submit  to  ADB  a  completion  report  that  provides  details  about\nimplementation, costs, benefits, and other information requested by ADB.\n\n41.\nCLCND  will  maintain  separate accounts for  the Project.  These  will  be  coordinated  and\nconsolidated by DEES, which will be responsible for preparation and audit of the accounts and\nthe  related  financial  statements  (expenditure  and  imprest  account)  by  domestic  auditors\nacceptable  to  ADB.  Certified  copies  of  the  audited  accounts  and  financial  statements  will  be\nsubmitted to ADB within nine months of the end of each related fiscal year.\n\n8.  \n\nMidterm Review\n\n42.\nThe Borrower,  the  World  Bank,  and  ADB  will  jointly  carry  out  a  midterm  review  of  the\nProject, if necessary, after the end of the first year of its implementation. The midterm review will\nassess (i) implementation status,  (ii)  design  and construction  standards,  (iii)  physical  progress\nmade  and  disbursements  in  relation  to  the  implementation  schedule,  (iv)  performance  of  the\nconsultants and  contractors, and  (v)  status  of  compliance  with  the  covenants  stipulated  in  the\nLoan  Agreement.  The  midterm  review  will  also  assess  the  need  for  any  additional  works  or\nchanges  in  the  project  scope  to  take  account  of  any  additional  landslides  resulting  from  the\n1999 floods.\n\n9.\n\nCommunity Participation\n\nThe Project was formulated in close consultation with the concerned local governments,\n43.\ncommunities affected by the floods and landslides, and other local groups and NGOs. Affected\n\n\f13\n\nfamilies in the disaster areas, including those headed by women, were visited, and interviewed\nto understand their difficulties and the nature of the assistance needed.\n\n10.\n\nOperation and Maintenance\n\n44.\nThe  restored  infrastructure  facilities  will  be  turned  over  to  the  concerned  local\ngovernments for operation and maintenance. The Government has given an assurance that the\ncompleted  project  facilities  will  be  maintained  properly  by  the  regional  authorities  through  the\nconcerned departments  and  utility  companies.  The  ongoing  TA  (footnote  5)  has  reviewed  the\nGovernment\u2019s  transport  policy  statement  and  recommended  that  the  existing  Road  Fund  be\nstrengthened  to  provide  for  the  road  maintenance.  This  matter  was  discussed  with  the\nGovernment by the TA Review Mission in October 1999 and will be followed-up during Project\nimplementation.\n\nG. \n\nThe Executing Agency\n\nDEES  is  responsible  for  rehabilitation  following  natural  disasters  and  ensuring  that\n45.\nsustainable reconstruction is implemented through zonal offices at the  regional  level.  DEES  is\ncapable of carrying out the executing agency functions. DEES also has a close relationship with\nMESCD,  whose  principal  functions  are  to  gather  data  on  the  scope  and  nature  of  disasters,\nrespond to the immediate relief and welfare of the affected people after  disasters,  and  restore\ntemporary civil services. At present, MESCD is carrying out this important role following the July\n1999 floods and landslides.\n\nCLCND is suitably experienced to act as the Implementing Agency for the Project, and\n46.\nfollowing  its establishment  in  1998  to  implement  the World  Bank\u2019s  EFAP,  it  is  expected  to  be\nretained as a permanent body in the Government structure. Besides being led by an official of\nhigh  standing  in  the  Government,  CLCND  has  over  30  current  staff  at  its  headquarters,\nincluding engineers of various disciplines and accountants. CLCND, as a separate legal entity,\nmaintains its own bank accounts, and is the official agency directly responsible for the planning,\ndesign, and implementation of permanent rehabilitation works after disasters.\n\nH.\n\n \n\nEnvironmental and Social Measures\n\n1. \n\nEnvironmental\n\nAn IEE of the Project was conducted during appraisal. The Government agrees to give\n47.\ndue attention to the environmental aspects and to follow the mitigating measures outlined in the\nIEE  during  implementation  (Appendix  8).  The  Government  will  also  require  DEES  and  other\nagencies concerned with project implementation to review the applicability of the IEE for each of\nthe  project  sites  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  guidelines  and  the  Government\u2019s  environmental\nstandards and regulations. Where necessary, EIAs will be prepared and  submitted  to  ADB for\napproval. If an EIA is found necessary, ADB financing will be contingent upon approval by ADB\nof a summary EIA.\n\n2.\n\nSocial\n\n48.\nThe initial social analysis prepared during appraisal is in Appendix 9. It is estimated that\nmore than 80 percent of the approximately 30,000 population in the project areas  are  living  in\npoverty. The Project will help bring social and economic life back to normal in the flood-affected\ncommunities. Rehabilitation of the roads, bridges, and  riverbank protection  works  will  assist  in\n\n\f14\n\nrestoring the supply and distribution network for basic goods and in regaining access to health\nand education facilities, particularly for poor communities in remote areas. The reconstruction of\nfive  damaged  schools  will  help  restore  the  basic  foundation  for  social  and  economic\nadvancement, and  support  the  Government\u2019s  efforts  to  improve  the  quality  of  social  services.\nDesign, construction, and the provision of equipment for the project schools will be carried out in\nclose coordination with implementation of the Social Sector Rehabilitation Project. The irrigation,\nwater supply, power, and telephone facilities to be reconstructed will help restore a sustainable\nliving environment to affected families, including the 288 households relocated from the disaster\nareas. The poor people living in the remote areas will receive the most direct benefits from the\nProject,  as  these  people  are  the  most  affected  by  the  damaged  public  infrastructure  and\ndisrupted social services.\n\n3.  Resettlement\n\n49. While  the  project  works  do  not  require  any  resettlement  of  people,  288  households  in\nAsht  District  of  Leninabad  Region,  whose houses  were  totally destroyed, are  regarded  by  the\nGovernment  as  living  in  flood-prone  areas.  Accordingly,  the  Government  has  established  two\nresettlement areas in that same district, and these have been made available at no cost to the\nhouseholders, together with the provision of housing, homestead land, and the same amount of\ncash  compensation  as  payable  to  all  flood-affected  people.  In  addition,  NGOs  are  providing\nfood,  clothing,  seeds,  medical  and  other  relief  goods.  Persons  being  resettled  who  were\ninterviewed  by  ADB\u2019s  Mission  indicated  they  welcomed  the  Government\u2019s  initiative  and\nassistance in the face of their dire need. While  the  resettlement  is  voluntary, the  Project  is  an\nopportunity  to  develop  an  understanding  with  the  Government  on  ADB\u2019s  perspectives  on  the\nsocial aspects of  project  design  and  resettlement.  Accordingly,  ADB  financing  and  retroactive\nfinancing for access roads, power, water supply, and a school in the resettlement areas will be\naccompanied  by  a  review  of  the  Government\u2019s  resettlement  plan  by  social  analysts  being\nengaged under the Project.\n\nI.\n\nBenefits and Justification\n\n50.\nThe Project will directly benefit the poverty-affected communities. In some remote areas\nwhere  roads  have  become  impassable  due  to  landslides  and  floods,  the  supply  of  basic\ncommodities will be restored. The Project will also deliver such socioeconomic benefits  as  the\nrestoration  of  power  supply,  reconstruction  of  irrigation  facilities,  and  resumption  of  access  to\nhealth services and education. Because more than 80 percent of the population  in  the Project\nareas  are  poor, the  Project  is  strongly  justified  as  it  will  restore  damaged  public  infrastructure\nand  improve  the  social  and  economic  conditions  for  the  flood  affected  and  poverty  stricken\ncommunities.\n\nThe project benefits are mostly nonincremental. The project components are designed to\n51.\nrestore disrupted public services in the affected areas in the shortest possible time, based on a\nleast-cost  solution.  However,  in  addition  to  the  baseline  data  to  be  prepared  by  the  domestic\nconsultant  social  analysts,  the  TA  consultant  will  assist  the  Government  in  assessing  the  net\npresent value of damaged facilities before and after restoration, and the economic costs of the\ntraffic disruptions due to the flood damage. In general, the process of benefit monitoring to be\nadopted  will  be  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  project  performance  management  system,  and  some\nbaseline  data  will  be  obtained  from  an  ongoing  World  Bank-financed  living  standards\nmeasurement survey.\n\n\fJ.\n\nRisks\n\n15\n\n52.\nThe  major  risks  involved  are  (i)  breakdown  of  the  postconflict  peace  accord,  (ii)  fresh\nlandslides and flooding  that  would  damage  the  completed  works,  (iii)  inadequate  construction\nsupervision  due  to  the  relative  inexperience  of  CLCND  and  the  multisectoral  coverage  of  the\nProject  over  a  widespread area, and  (iv)  inadequate  maintenance of  completed  works.  These\nrisks would all tend to detract from the poverty reduction objective of  the Project.  They  will  be\nmitigated  through  lessening  of  tensions  that  foster  conflict;  wide  geographic  coverage  and\nflexibility to avoid direct conflict areas; close coordination of review missions conducted by the\nWorld Bank and ADB; careful project design, including a design review of riverbank protection\nworks to be completed in December 1999 under the EFAP; regular coordination with NGOs; the\ninput of accompanying TA consulting  services;  and  the application of  recommendations under\nthe ongoing TA 3114. An assessment will also be made during the midterm review of any need\nfor additional works or change in project scope. In addition, a Government request in September\n1999  for  a  separate  ADB-financed  TA  is  being  considered  for  a  comprehensive  Flood\nManagement  Plan.  This  latter  TA  will  deal  with  the  long-term  sustainability  of  flood-prone\ninfrastructure and improved land use, particularly for erosion-prone mountain slopes.\n\n VI.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\n\nThe Government has  requested the  TA  to  build  the  Government\u2019s  capacity  to  manage\n53.\nflood  disasters  following  the  episodes  in  1998  and  1999. While  MESCD,  DEES,  and  CLCND\nhave  gained  useful  experience  under  the  EFAP,  further  capacity  building  is  necessary  in  the\nefficient coordination of the preparedness, relief, and rehabilitation response phases of disaster\nmanagement.  The  TA  will  help  to  improve  flood  disaster  management  and  provide  suitable\ntraining. The  TA  will  also provide guidance  in  dealing  with  the  requirements  and opportunities\navailable through international funding agencies and NGOs, and provide a useful basis for the\npreparation  of  a  long-term  flood  management  plan.  The  TA  will  cost  $235,000  equivalent,\ncomprising foreign exchange costs of $204,000 and local currency costs of $31,000 equivalent.\nADB  will  finance  $205,000  equivalent,  to  cover  all  the  foreign  exchange  costs  and  $1,000\nequivalent  of  the  local  currency  costs.  The  funding  will  be  on  a  grant  basis  from  the  Japan\nSpecial  Fund,  funded  by  the  Government  of  Japan.  The  Government  will  finance  $30,000\nequivalent of the local currency costs. Terms of reference for the 5 person-months of consulting\nservices  are  in  Appendix  10,  and  cost  estimates  are  in  Appendix  11.  Because  of  the  close\nlinkage of the TA with the loan, a direct appointment of the consultant will be considered, using\nthe firm currently engaged under TA 3114 (footnote 5) and TA 3168 (footnote 6).\n\nA. \n\nSpecific Assurances\n\n VII.  ASSURANCES\n\n54.\nThe  Government  has  given  the  following  assurance,  in  addition  to  the  standard\nassurances, which have been incorporated in the legal documents: In implementing the Project,\nmitigating measures in the IEE will be  implemented for each project  site. Government permits\nwill be obtained promptly, and if necessary, any EIAs will be conducted in accordance with the\nGovernment\u2019s environmental regulations and ADB\u2019s Environmental Assessment Requirements,\nEnvironmental Guidelines for Selected Infrastructure Projects, and Environmental Guidelines for\nSelected Agriculture and Natural Resources Projects.\n\n\f16\n\nNo disbursement will be made by ADB for public infrastructure in the resettlement areas\n55.\nuntil  the  resettlement  plan  of  the  Government  has  been  received  by  ADB  and  found  to  be\nsatisfactory.\n\nB.\n\nCondition for Loan Effectiveness\n\nThe Government will recruit an adequate number of staff, with skills agreed by ADB, for\n\n56.\nthe project implementation unit.\n\n VIII.  RECOMMENDATION\n\n57.\nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  loan  would  comply  with  the  Articles  of  Agreement  of\nADB  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to\nSpecial  Drawing  Rights  3,601,000  to  the  Republic  of  Tajikistan  for  the  Emergency  Flood\nRehabilitation Project, with a term of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years, and with an\ninterest charge at the rate of 1 percent per annum during the grace period and 1.5 percent per\nannum thereafter, and such other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with\nthose set forth in the draft Loan Agreement presented to the Board.\n\n                                                                                                                         President\n\nTADAO CHINO\n\n5 November 1999\n\n\f17\n\nAPPENDIXES\n\nNumber\n\nTitle\n\nPage\n\nCited on\n(page, para.)\n\n  1\n\n  2\n\n  3\n\n  4\n\n  5\n\n  6\n\n  7\n\n  8\n\n  9\n\n10\n\n11\n\nDetails of the Flood Damage\n\nProject Scope\n\nCost Estimates\n\nImplementation Arrangements\n\nTerms of Reference for \nProject Implementation Consultants\n\nProcurement Contract Packages\n\nImplementation Schedule\n\nSummary Initial Environmental Examination\n\nSummary Initial Social Assessment \n\nTerms of Reference for the\nTechnical Assistance for\nFlood Disaster Management\n\nCost Estimates and Financing Plan for the\nTechnical Assistance for\nFlood Disaster Management\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n22\n\n23\n\n28\n\n29\n\n30\n\n35\n\n37\n\n39\n\n 4, 15\n\n 8, 28\n\n 9, 29\n\n10, 31\n\n11, 35\n\n11, 36\n\n12, 39\n\n13, 47\n\n13, 48\n\n15, 53\n\n15, 53\n\n\fAppendix 1\n\nDETAILS OF THE FLOOD DAMAGE\n(TJR' 000)\n\nLeninabad\n\nQuantity\n\nCost\n\nKhatlon/RRS/GBAR\nQuantity\n\nCost\n\nTotal\n\nQuantity\n\nCost\n\nSector\n\nA.

The  resulting  torrential  rainfall  was  widespread  but\nlocally,  in  some  mountainous  areas  of  Tajikistan,  the  rainfall  intensity  had  an  expected  return\nperiod of 50 years, and over 400 millimeter (mm) fell in a nine-hour period in one affected area\nin northern Tajikistan. The floods and landslides caused the death of 27 people and over 2,000\nhouses  were  destroyed  or  seriously  damaged.  Over  3,000  farm  animals  and  about  12,000\nhectares of crops were also lost. Damage to public infrastructure included about 600 kilometer\n(km) or roads; over 1,000 meters of bridges; associated riverbank protection works; as well as\npower  and  telephone  lines,  water  supply  systems,  several  schools,  and  a  health  center\n(Appendix 1).\n\nThis  summary  initial  environmental  examination  concerns  the  proposed  Emergency\n2.\nFlood  Rehabilitation  Project,  in  response  to  the  disaster  in  Tajikistan.  The  IEE  was  prepared\nduring  the  appraisal  mission  in  accordance  with  the  Bank\u2019s  Environmental  Assessment\nRequirements,  the  Environmental  Guidelines  for  Selected  Infrastructure  Projects,  and  the\nEnvironmental  Guidelines  for  Selected  Agriculture  and  Natural  Resources  Projects.  The  IEE\nwas  prepared  in  consultation  with  secondary  data,  relevant  reports,  and  discussions  with\nhydrological  and  meteorological  experts  of  the  local  environmental  authorities,  and  design\ninstitutes responsible for the detailed design of the major civil works contracts under the Project,\nas well as with local residents in the project areas. Available baseline environmental and social\ndata  were  reviewed,  and  field  investigations  were  carried  out  to  assess  the  present\nenvironmental conditions in selected project areas. Also, possible environmental impacts  were\nestimated, and mitigating measures were selected and planned to minimize the adverse effects\nexpected during and after project implementation.\n\nB. \n\nDescription of the Project\n\nThe  Project  consists  of  the  emergency  rehabilitation  of  priority  public  infrastructure  in\n3.\nflood-affected regions (provinces) and will complement a similar World Bank project. The World\nBank  initiated  an  Emergency  Flood  Assistance  Project  (EFAP)  in  response  to  similar  floods\naffecting mainly Khatlon Region in 1998; it will now provide supplementary financing to address\nsome  of  the  new  damage  in  1999.  The  Bank-financed  project  will  rehabilitate  damaged\ninfrastructure  in  areas  of  Khatlon  Region  not  covered  by  the  World  Bank,  as  well  as  in\nnonconflict areas of the Regions of Republican Subordination (RRS), Leninabad Region and in\nthe remote and apparently less-affected Gorno-Badakhshan Autonomous Region (GBAR). The\nProject addresses damaged roads, bridges, and associated riverbank protection; irrigation and\nwater supply; power and telephone distribution; and schools. In addition, the Project will finance\na  range  of  public  infrastructure  at  two  existing  resettlement  areas  for  288  households  whose\nhouses were totally damaged and were located in flood-prone areas (Appendix 2).\n\n4.\nThe roads, bridges, and riverbank protection works involve the rehabilitation of collapsed\nor seriously damaged sections. Most roads in the mountainous country closely follow the  river\nvalleys  and  are  vulnerable  to  flood-induced  erosion.  Where  necessary,  the  Project  will\nrehabilitate the damaged facilities to a higher standard, to better withstand erosion. In particular,\nsome bridges will be designed with larger cross-sectional openings than for existing box culvert\ndesigns,  to  allow  a  freer  flow  of  water  and  with  adequate  piling  and  abutments  to  withstand\n\n\fAppendix 8, page 2\n\nscouring  and  heavier  river  bed-load,  which  may  be  expected  during  flood  conditions.  The\nirrigation  and  water  supply  works  will  also  be  reconstructed  with a  view  to  improving  ability  to\nwithstand  future  floods.  Particular  attention  will  be  given  to  embankments,  water  impounding\ndams,  irrigation  channels,  water  supply  and  drainage  channels  and  piping,  water  regulating\nstructures  and  pumps,  sediment  traps,  and  culverts.  Additional  works  will  be  considered  to\nenhance the flow  capacity  and  avoid contamination and erosion of these facilities.  The  power\nand  telephone  distribution  facilities  will  be  realigned  to  reduce  risk  of  being  undermined  by\nriverbank  erosion,  and  the  existing  sites  of  damaged  schools  will  be  examined  to  assess  the\nneed  for  re-siting  or  other  cost-effective  measures  to  avoid  flood  damage.  The  rehabilitation\nactivities will have some temporary impacts during construction but no significant or permanent\nimpacts  will  occur  that  cannot  be  avoided  by  attention  to  sound  engineering  practices  in  the\nproject design and implementation.\n\nC. \n\nDescription of the Environment\n\n1. \n\nPhysical Resources\n\nNinety-three percent of the 143,100 square km (km2) area of Tajikistan is mountainous\n5.\nand  prone  to  earthquakes,  and  50  percent  is  above  3,000  meters.  The  eastern  GBAR  of  the\ncountry includes the Pamir Mountains with peaks up to 7,500 meters, while the western part of\nthe  country  is  lowland  plain of  about  300  meters  above  sea  level,  bisected  by  narrow  ranges\nwith  peaks  of  over  4,000  meters.  For  eight  months  each  year,  the  mountain  passes  between\nnorthern  and  southern  Tajikistan  are  blocked  by  snow.  The  climate  varies  from  continental  to\nsubtropical with temperatures ranging from 22 degrees Celsius in July to \u20137 degrees Celsius in\nJanuary at 2,000 meters. Most precipitation occurs in winter and spring.\n\n6.\nThe  sun-melted  mountain  ice  is  the  source  of  a  network  of  nearly  1,000  fast-flowing\nstreams with upper catchment gradients of about 40 meters per km, many of which empty into\nTajikistan\u2019s  two  major  rivers,  the Syr  River,  rising  in  the  Ferghana  Valley,  and  the  Amu  River\nrising in the Pamirs, both flow into the Aral Sea. While the country comprises only six percent of\nthe Aral Sea basin, it produces about 50 percent of the total flow into the sea, or about 70 km3\nper  year.  Flows  vary  according  to  the  season,  and  the  Vakhsh  River  carries  30  times  more\nwater  in  July  than  during  winter.  Natural  erosion  rates  are  high  as  are  the  suspended  loads\nduring summer. The total surface area of lakes in the country is 700 km2 with a total volume of\n44 km3.\n\nTajikistan is rich in biodiversity. The variety of natural landscapes creates conditions for\n7. \nmore  than  10,000  species  of  invertebrates,  49  species  of  fish,  2  species  of  amphibians,  44\nspecies of reptiles, 348 bird species of which many are migratory, and 84 species of mammals.\nSome distinctive mammal species are in decline, in spite of inhabiting remote  areas,  including\nthe  snow  leopard,  Pamir  mountain  sheep,  Bukharan  mountain  sheep,  Bukharan  deer,  and\nVingtorogii goat. An estimated 5,000 species of vascular plants are found in Tajikistan, many of\nthem  endemic.  Native  species  include  slow-growing  pistachios,  walnuts,  and  tulip  poplars.  At\nleast 135 plants have medicinal value.\n\n8. \nThe  country  is  also  endowed  with  rich  mineral  resources,  including  aluminum,  gold,\nsilver,  lead,  strontium,  and  zinc.  There  are  also  iron,  tin,  and  tungsten,  molybdenum,  and\nmercury  deposits.  It  is  estimated  that  there  are  150  tons  of  gold  resources,  including  alluvial\ndeposits.  A  Tajik-British  joint  venture  gold-mining  operation  commenced  in  1996  in  the\nPendzhikent  area,  and  a  silver-lead  mine  with  large  remaining  resources  recently  ceased\noperation in the project area of Adrasman.\n\n\fAppendix 8, page 3\n\n2. \n\nSocioeconomic Resources\n\n9. \nTajikistan  has  a  total  population  of  6.1  milllion,  of  which  27  percent  is  urban.  The\naverage  population  density  is  42.5  per  km2,  and  the  annual  population  growth  rate  is  1.6\npercent.  Tajiks  are  60  percent,  Uzbeks  23  percent,  and  ethnic  Russians  3  percent  of  the\npopulation. The remaining 14 percent are mainly ethnic Kyrgyz and Tatars. The population living\nbelow the poverty line is over 80 percent following the collapse of the former Soviet Union and\nloss of its social safety net, poor access to world markets, and the consequences of conflict and\nnatural  disasters  since  independence  in  1991.  The  peace  accord  of  1997  has  freed  the\nGovernment  to  give  more  attention  to  stabilizing  the  economy  and  addressing  environmental\nconcerns.\n\n3. \n\nEnvironmental Issues\n\n10.  While  the  economic  downturn  since  independence  has  had  positive  environmental\nimpacts in cleaner air  in  urban  and  industrial  areas,  and  reduced  soil  contamination from  less\napplication  of  fertilizer,  these  problems  will  re-emerge  as  the  economy  improves.  There  have\nalso  been  negative  impacts  during  the  1990s.  These  include  increased  erosion  due  to\ndeforestation for fuel wood and indiscriminate overgrazing by privately owned herds of livestock,\nless sewage treatment and growth of informal waste dumps contributing to contaminated water\nsupply,  and  soils  impaired  due  to  poor  irrigation  management  and  salinization.  Two  of  the\ncountry\u2019s  protected  areas  (zapavedniks)  also  deteriorated  during  the  civil  war  due  to\nuncontrolled hunting.\n\nAllegations of transboundary air and water pollution are in contention between Tajikistan\n11. \nand  Uzbekistan due  to the  emission  of  hydrogen  fluoride  waste  from  the  aluminum  factory  at\nTursunazade.  The  mercury  content of  the  Zerevshan  River  due  to  the Anzob  gold  processing\nplant,  and  mineralization  of  the  Syrdarya  River  due  to  agricultural  processes  in  the  Kyrgyz\nRepublic  and  Uzbekistan  are  also  areas  of  transboundary  concern.  Most  mining  activity  in\nTajikistan  has  historically  adopted  an  open-pit  approach,  and  reclamation  has  not  been  a\npractice.  There  are  also  issues  concerning  the  legacy  of  inadequately  stored  nuclear  waste\nproducts in Leninabad Region.\n\n12. \nReliable  data  on  access  to  safe  water  are  not  available.  However,  nearly  all  urban\ndwellers and about half of the rural communities rely on groundwater resources. It is estimated\nthat about 40 percent of the water supply systems do not meet sanitary norms due to failure to\nprotect the water source, and lack of treatment facilities or faulty distribution, including damaged\nfacilities  and  inadequate  wastewater \ntyphoid,  dysentery,  and\nleptospirosis attest to the inadequate supplies of potable drinking water.\n\ntreatment.  Outbreaks  of \n\nTajikistan  has  a  naturally  high  susceptibility  to  water-related  disasters  due  to  the\n13. \ndynamic mountain terrain, heavy precipitation and spring snow melt, steep narrow valleys, and\nsparse  mountain  vegetation.  These  problems  are  exacerbated  by  human  activity,  including\ndeforestation, overgrazing and road building. Damage due to floods over the past five years is\nestimated  to  have  cost  over  TJR  400  billion  (about  $300  million).  A  growing  problem  is\nsalinization  of  agricultural  soils  due  to  capillary  action  induced  by  irrigation  and  raised  water\ntables.\n\n\fAppendix 8, page 4\n\nD. \n\nPotential Environmental Impacts and Project Mitigation Measures\n\n1. \n\nGeneral Approach\n\nBecause  of  the  difficult  terrain,  rural  roads,  human  settlements,  and  water  supply  and\n14. \nirrigation  offtakes  in  Tajikistan  tend  to  be  located  within  the  narrow  river  valleys.  The\nconstruction  of  roads,  settlements  and  the  increased  land  use  due  to  settlements  have\ncontributed  to  increased  erosion  and  land  losses.  However,  the  damaged  roads  and  other\ninfrastructure are vital to the local communities. Moreover, reforestation, improved management\nof pasture, irrigation and water supply systems, and proper design and maintenance of road and\nriverbank protection works and river crossings may also improve environmental conditions. It is\nwithin  the  latter  context  of  environmental  awareness  that  the  Project  is  proposed  and  will  be\nimplemented,  although  the  damaged  infrastructure  will  be  rehabilitated  in  generally  the  same\nlocation and along the same alignment as before, and usually, of the same design. Exceptions\nwill be that some river protection works may be higher and some bridges will have larger open\ncross-sectional area for flood flows to pass and deeper foundations to resist  local  scouring.  In\nmany  locations,  river  bank  protection  material  will  be  sourced  from  the  bed-load  deposits\nresulting  from  the  recent  50-year  return  period  floods,  and  which  was  dumped  at  constriction\npoints  such  as  upstream  of  some  inadequately  designed  bridges.  Natural  stream  flow  will  be\nrestored  in  these  locations.  Some  river  channel  straightening  may  also  be  needed  by\nconstructing boulder  embankments  within  the  existing,  erosion-widened  valleys.  This  will  help\ncreate  a  buffer  zone  between  river  channels  and  road  margins.  This  will  be  accompanied  by\nattention  to  improved  toe-slope  design,  and  bioengineering  solutions  for  planting  both  road\nmargins  and  valley  slopes  above  road  sections  damaged  by  slope  failures  and  landslides.\nWhere landslides have temporarily caused the partial damming or rivers, particular care will be\ngiven  to  adequate  slope  protection  and  land  use  management  in  the  general  vicinity.  Some\nbridges may also be relocated to more stable sections of the river, and care will be given to the\ndesign  of  approach  roads  and  abutments  to  avoid  constricting  the  natural  river  flow.  In  many\ncases,  power  and  telephone  lines  will  be  carefully  resited  to  reduce  the  risk  of  their  being\nwashed out or eroded.\n\n2. \n\nConstruction Stage\n\n15. \nDuring construction, the main environmental problems will be associated with sourcing,\ntransporting, and stockpiling materials and construction equipment. Care will also be needed in\nthe  operation  of  equipment  to avoid  oil pollution, noise, dust  creation,  or  the  contamination  of\nwater  supply  and  irrigation  systems,  which  may  impact  adversely  on  local  communities,\necology, and livestock. While most protection materials may be sourced from constriction points\ncreated by bed load during the flood, steel and cement for road, bridge, and other civil works will\nbe transported by truck. Attention will be needed to avoid overloading and contributing to further\nroad  and  slope  damage.  Instructions  will  be  given  to  managers  to  minimize  dust  problems\nduring  construction  by  water  sprinkling  and  enforcing  speed  restrictions  by  construction\nvehicles. Particular attention will also be given to equipment maintenance to avoid oil spills and\nleaks, especially when operating in the riverbeds. Construction camps and stockpiles, including\nfuel,  will  as  far  as  possible,  use  any  existing  facilities.  In  all  cases,  the  arrangements  will  be\nsmall  scale  and  located  on  wasteland  to  avoid  tree  or  vegetation  cutting,  contamination,  and\nhazards. Local communities will also be consulted and  will  provide  the  main  labor force.  Care\nand involvement of the local communities will be needed to ensure the proper demobilization of\nthese  camps  at  the  end  of  the  Project  to  ensure  they  do  not  have  a  lasting  impact  on  the\nenvironment and the visual landscape.\n\n\fAppendix 8, page 5\n\n3. \n\nOperating Stage\n\n16. \nThe main environmental problems during operation of the rehabilitated infrastructure will,\napart from the environmental  risks  that  prevailed  previously  due  to  traffic  in  community  areas\nand water use problems, be the need for proper maintenance and minimizing the risk of further\ndamage.  The  main  mitigation  strategy  to  be  adopted  will  be  through  Bank-financed  TA  for\ninstitutional  strengthening  on  disaster  awareness  and  management,  focused  on  sustainable\nsolutions. Essentially, this will involve local communities and NGOs to help create a synergy for\nimproved  maintenance,  reinforced  by  Government  allocations  of  maintenance  budget,  and\nplanning and management resources. Attention will also be given to full use of the rehabilitated\nschools, provision of adequate textbooks, and monitoring by the Bank of the timely placement of\nteachers.  Linkages  will  also be forged  with  the ongoing  TA and programmed  loan  for  a  Road\nRehabilitation Project and possible  TA  in 2000 for  a  comprehensive  Flood  Management Plan,\nincluding cooperation with the World Bank and other members of the aid community involved in\nland use activities.\n\nE. \n\nInitial Requirements and Environmental Monitoring\n\n17.\nA  domestic  consultant  environment  specialist  will  be  recruited  under  the  loan  for\nintermittent  services  totaling  about  6  person-months.  In  coordination  with  the  head  of  the\nGovernment\u2019s  project  implementation  unit,  the  environment  specialist  will  visit  each  of  the\nproject  sites  to  review  the  IEE  findings  and  mitigation  measures.  If  necessary,  a  full\nenvironmental impact assessment (EIA) will be conducted, and EIA and Summary EIA reports\nwill be prepared; Bank approval will be a condition for financing the related project components.\nDuring project implementation, the environment specialist will advise contractors and the project\nimplementation unit staff on mitigating measures to be followed, and liaise with NGOs and local\ngroups to ensure their understanding to maximize opportunities for their input to the operational\naspects of the environmental mitigation. The consultant\u2019s terms of reference are in Appendix 5.\n\nF. \n\nConclusions\n\n18.\nBased on the IEE findings, the Project will have minor impacts on the environment and\nan EIA is not required, because the works substantially involve reinstatement of infrastructure in\nthe  existing  location,  to  approximately  the  same  standards  (except  where  improvements  are\nnecessary  to  reduce  the  susceptibility  of  the  works  to  recurrent  floods).  Careful  attention  to\nenvironmental  concerns  will  nevertheless  be  necessary  during  construction  such  as  careful\nsiting of  stockpiles,  minimizing dust and  oil pollution from  trucks,  and  adopting  bioengineering\ninslope protection. Sustainability will be improved by involving local communities and NGOs in\nthe planning and conduct of future maintenance, and implementation of Bank-financed TA.\n\n\fAppendix 9, page 1\n\nSUMMARY INITIAL SOCIAL ASSESSMENT\n\nA. \n\nBenefits and Beneficiaries\n\nThe  project  benefits  comprise  restored  use  of  damaged  infrastructure,  primarily  rural\n1. \nroads and bridges, associated river-bank protection works, small irrigation and community water\nsupply  systems,  power  and  telephone  distribution  networks,  and  schools.  For  288  resettled\nhouseholds living in areas threatened by recurrent floods, the future outlook will be improved by\nnew housing, cash compensation, and facilities in safe areas, while retaining the structure and\nmembership of their previous communities.\n\nB. \n\nNeeds, Demands, and Absorptive Capacity\n\n2. \nThe  flood  effects  have  reduced  rural  income;  this  will  continue  until  effective\nrehabilitation is completed. Access to township markets has been severed or made difficult for\nmany remote communities and farmers; there has been substantial loss of agricultural land, soil,\ncrops,  and  livestock;  irrigation  system  losses  are  serious  in  the  relatively  dry  climate;  many\nhouseholds have been forced to sell depleted livestock assets due to feed losses; and resettled\nfamilies are especially dependent on Government and nongovernment organization (NGO) food\nand seed handouts until their first crops are produced.\n\n3. \nExcept  for  the  rehabilitated  irrigation  and  water  supply  systems,  the  Project  will  not\ndirectly resolve these problems. However, the reconstructed roads, bridges, riverbank protection\nworks, telephones, and power will restore the necessary  access to basic  services  and  help to\nimprove  the  infrastructure  framework  for  broader  economic  recovery.  The  Project  will  also\ncontribute to postconflict recovery, and generally enhance the outlook for improving vulnerable\ngroup opportunities.\n\nC.\n\nSocial Dimensions in Project Design\n\n1. \n\nPoverty\n\nPoverty  steadily  increased  in  Tajikistan  after  the  collapse  of  the  former  Soviet  Union\u2019s\n4. \nsocial safety net and civil war soon after independence in 1991. Recovery and self reliance has\nbeen weakened, since the end of internal conflicts in 1997, by reduced world market prices for\nmain  exports,  distance  from  world  markets,  and  inflation,  which  has  severely  depressed\npensions.  More  than  80  percent  of  the  population  are  living  below  the  poverty  line.  About  a\nquarter  of  these  people  are  facing  chronic  poverty  and  are  unable  even  to  claim  the\nGovernment\u2019s meager social security. Rural households, which dominate the  project  area, are\namong  those  most  affected  by  poverty.  This  is  accompanied  by  prevailing  contamination  of\nwater supply and the  salinization  of  irrigated  areas.  The  main feature of traditional  rural  life  in\nTajikistan,  however,  is  the  practice  of  homestead  gardening.  This  provides  some  measure  of\nresilience from poverty impacts and for some, provides a small resource to pay for some basic\nservices  such  as  power  consumption,  health  care,  and  transportation.  Farm  families  and\nhomesteaders, among those who lost a total of 12,000 hectares of crops and over 2,000 houses\nduring the July 1999 floods, are therefore in dire need of aid. While relief measures were prompt\nand  are  being  sustained  with  assistance  by  leading  NGOs,  there  is  an  acute  need  to  restore\nland  and access  to  markets and other  services on  a  sustainable  basis.  The  project  works  will\nalso add a temporary source of income for affected households capable of providing labor.\n\n\fAppendix 9, page 2\n\n2.\n\nGender and Vulnerable Groups\n\n5. \nAs a result of the civil war that officially ended in 1997, and a series of earthquakes and\nfloods  in  the  1990s,  about  50,000  lives  were  lost,  many  of  them  household  income  earners.\nAbout 55,000 children were orphaned and 20,000 women were widowed. While peace is being\nrestored and the aid community is making efforts to restore the economy on a sustainable basis,\nthe  economic  burdens  during  the  recovery  are  heaviest  households  headed  by  women  and\nchildren. Because the 1999 floods were widespread and data is currently unreliable, it can only\nbe  assumed  that  these  groups  are  among  those  worst  affected  by  the  floods,  including\nsusceptibility to disease as a result of malnutrition. In 1997, 11.4 percent of the population died\nbefore the age of 40. As the average age of marriage is 20 years and fertility rates are high (3.7\npercent), it can also be assumed that the conditions for women and children are still worsening.\nSince the education sector was also badly affected by the events of the 1990s, the outlook for\nchildren to share in the economic recovery has been weakened further. A feature of the problem\nis  rural  to  urban  migration  and  recourse  to  crime  and  begging  among  the  vulnerable  groups,\nincluding  the  approximately  30  percent  of  the  working  population  who  are  unemployed  and\ndisaffected,  in  spite  of  official  statistics  that  indicate  low  levels  of  unemployment.  Boarding\ninstitutions for orphans, old-aged, and handicapped people,  called internats, are  almost  totally\nineffective due to lack of funds. While NGOs are providing some relief, there is a need to move\ncommunity-based  rather  than  institutional  care.  This  will  help  to  reduce  the  cost  of  care  and\nprovide  children  with  access  to  normal  social  interaction.  The  proposed  Bank-financed  Social\nSector  Rehabilitation  Project  and  associated  technical  assistance  for  Social  Safety  Net\nReconstruction  will  help  to  improve  this  situation  and  outlook.  The  Emergency  Flood\nRehabilitation Project will not add directly to these efforts, but will restore some access to basic\nservices  among  those  who  are  not  facing  chronic  levels  of  poverty.  It  will,  however,  directly\nassist the Government, NGOs, and other project efforts in gaining access and helping to serve\nthe interests of deeply vulnerable groups.\n\n3. \n\nResettlement\n\n6.\nThe restoration of facilities is not expected to entail any land acquisition, including those\nareas  where  the  restoration  will  improve  standards.  Any  such  requirements  are  expected  to\ninvolve wasteland. In the two resettlement areas of Asht District, for the 288 households being\nmoved  from  flood  vulnerable  areas,  the  land,  previously  uninhabited  and  unused,  has  been\nprovided by the local authority, and site preparation and house construction was well advanced\nwithin three weeks of the disaster. Cash compensation, new housing, and homestead gardens\nand crop seeds have been provided by the Government. Leading NGOs have and continue to\nprovide  temporary  shelter,  food,  clothing,  medicine,  and  other  relief  goods,  and  the  Bank-\nfinancing will be for improved road access and provision of basic public infrastructure facilities,\nincluding  power,  water  supply,  telephone  access,  and  a  school.  Persons  interviewed  by  the\nMission  indicated  their  general  satisfaction  with  the  arrangements  and  efforts  to  house  them\nbefore  the  coming  winter.
