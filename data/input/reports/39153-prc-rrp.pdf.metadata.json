The  Project  is  the  first  stand-alone  sector-wide \nintervention  by  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  for  enhancing \nrailway safety on a network basis. It will promote railway safety through \nthe \ntechnology,  capacity  building,  and \ninstitutional development. These actions will lead to improved reliability, \nhigher mobility, increased network capacity, optimal use of the network \nand  assets,  and  increased  staff  productivity\u2014all  of  which  will  lead  to  a \nhigher level of efficiency in railway transport in the People\u2019s Republic of \nChina (PRC).  \n \nThe  Project  reflects  ADB\u2019s  railway  sector  operational  strategy  for  the \nPRC,  which  includes  promoting  sustainable  economic  growth  by \nimproving  the  efficiency  of  railway  transport  through  reducing  railway \nnetwork constraints and enhancing railway safety. The components are \nformulated  in  line  with  the  2004  railway  development  plan  and  the \nEleventh FYP for railway development. \n \nDelays \nrestoration  of  accidents  and \nemergencies  contribute  to  loss  of  lives,  heavy  damages  to  goods  and \npeople,  and  prolonged  disruption  of  traffic  movement  on  the  PRC \nrailway network. They are also two of the constraints preventing railways \nfrom capitalizing on their comparative advantages. \n \nThe Project will (i) introduce new and modern technology for responding \nmore quickly to emergencies, taking less restoration time and enhancing \nsafety;  (ii)  provide  capacity  building  support  for  handling  emergencies \nmore  efficiently;  and  (iii)  provide  an \nfor \ndeveloping  a  quick,  responsive,  and  efficient  emergency  rescue  and \nrestoration  system  on  the  PRC  railway  network.  This  will  help  improve \nsafety  and  reliability,  increase  mobility,  and  reduce  downtime\u2014all  of \nwhich  will  help  achieve  higher  standards  of  railway  safety,  staff \nproductivity, and line capacity. \n \nThe Project will help develop an efficient, safe, reliable, and competitive \nrailway transport system in the PRC. The outcome of the Project will be \nan efficient and effective railway emergency management system on the \n\n \nImpact and \nOutcome \n\nrescue  and \n\ninstitutional \n\nframework \n\ninefficient \n\nin \n\n \n\n\fii \n\n \n\n \nProject Investment \nPlan \n \nFinancing Plan \n\n \nPeriod of \nUtilization \n \nEstimated Project \nCompletion Date \n \nExecuting Agency  MOR \n \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\n \n\n \nProcurement \n\nPRC railway network. This will be achieved by introducing safe, reliable, \nenergy-efficient,  and  environment-friendly \ntechnologies;  and  by \nproviding  capacity  building  support  via  staff  training,  which  will  help \ndevelop a more responsive, quicker, and efficient rescue and restoration \nsystem for dealing with emergencies on PRC railways. \n \nThe Project comprises the following: (i) supply and installation of railway \nemergency rescue and restoration equipment, (ii) capacity building and \ntraining,  and  (iii)  institutional  development.  The  key  inputs  needed  for \nproject  implementation  include  supply  of  equipment,  training,  and \nMinistry of Railways (MOR) staff inputs. \n \nThe investment cost is estimated at $140 million.  \n\n \nA  loan  of  $100  million  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources  will  be \nprovided  under  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based \nlending  facility.  The  loan  will  have  a  25-year  term  including  a  grace \nperiod of 5 years, an interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nLIBOR-based  lending  facility,  a  commitment  charge  of  0.35%  per \nannum,  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  set  forth  in  the  draft  loan \nagreement. \n \nUntil 30 June 2013 \n \n \n31 December 2012 \n\n \nThe  Project  will  be  implemented  by  MOR  over  5  years.  MOR  will \ncoordinate  the  project  management  tasks  and  be  responsible  for \nprocurement, withdrawals, and reporting to ADB.  \n \nMOR will procure ADB-financed components in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nProcurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time). \nContracts  valued  at  or  greater  than  $1  million  will  be  procured  through \ninternational  competitive  bidding.  Contracts  valued  at \nthan \n$1 million  will  be  procured  through  international  competitive  bidding  or \nnational competitive bidding, in accordance with the PRC Tendering and \nBidding  Law,  1999,  subject  to  clarifications  agreed  with  ADB  as \ndetermined by the contract package. Below $100,000, procurement will \nfollow the shopping procedure. Other items, not financed by ADB, will be \nprocured  in  accordance  with  government  procedures  acceptable  to \nADB.  \n \nThe  ADB  loan  will  finance  5  person-months  of  consulting  services  for \nstrengthening the institutional and capacity development  functions of  the \nrailway  emergency  management  system.  Consultants  will  be  recruited \nusing  the  quality  and  cost-based  method  (80%  technical  and  20% \nfinancial weightings) and biodata technical proposal, in accordance with \n\nless \n\n \nConsulting \nServices \n\n \n\n\f \n\niii\n\n \n\nADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2007,  as  amended  from \ntime to time).  \n \nThe  Project  will  (i) enhance  railway  safety,  enabling  railway  users  to \nbenefit  from  lower  transport  costs;  (ii)  increase  the  line  capacity, \nbenefiting consumers and producers of goods and services through the \nprovision  of  timely  and  efficient  transport  services  and  lower  logistics \ncosts;  (ii)  improve  staff  productivity,  enabling  railway  users  to  benefit \nfrom  lower  costs;  (iv) improve  environment  and  reduce  pollution;  and \n(v) reduce  fuel  consumption  and  enhance  energy  efficiency,  enabling \nthe PRC to save valuable foreign exchange.  \n \nThe  major  project  beneficiaries  will  be  (i)  the  Government,  which  will \nbenefit from improved safety, reduced economic losses, and a reduced \nenergy bill; (ii) passengers, who will benefit from affordable, faster, and \nsafer  trips;  and  (iii)  freight  shippers,  who  will  benefit  from  reduced \ndamages to shipments and more affordable, faster, and safer trips.  \n \nSafe rail transport will benefit all passenger and shippers. The poor will \nbenefit equally or more from the intervention. The links between poverty \nand  accidents  are  apparent,  and  the  poor  are  at  a  disadvantage \nrecovering  from  the  physical  and  the  economic  losses  suffered  from \ninjuries  or  physical  loss  of  goods.  The  Project  will  provide  an  efficient \nand quick restoration system that will help reduce economic losses.  \n \nThe  Project  is  economically  sustainable.  The  economic  internal  rate  of \nreturn is estimated at 57.2%.  \n \nPotential  risks  for  the  Project  during  implementation  could  be  in  the \nareas of financing, technology, interoperability, and procurement. These \nhave  been  assessed,  and  mitigating  measures  have  been  provided \nbased  on  lessons  from  other  railway  projects  in  the  PRC.  Inadequate \nstaff  skills  are  also  a  risk  to  the  Project.  The  project  design  includes  a \ncapacity development program to enhance staff skills, as they are critical \nto the success of the Project.  \n\n \nProject Benefits \nand Beneficiaries \n\n \nRisks and \nAssumptions \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\ft\n\no\n\n \n\nU\n\nr\n\nu\n\nm\n\nq\n\ni\n\n35  00'No\n\no\n100  00'E\n\nM O N G O L I A\n\nRAILWAY SAFETY\nENHANCEMENT PROJECT\nIN THE\nPEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA\n\no\n120  00'E\n\nINNER   MONGOLIA\n\nHEBEI\n\nJining\n\nHohhot\n\nBaotou\n\nHuang He\n\n(Yello\n\nDatong\n\nw River)\n\nDongsheng\n\nYumen\n\nYinchuan\n\nShenmu North\n\nBEIJING\n\nQinhuangdao\n\nShuoxian\n\nBazhou\n\nTianjin\n\nTIANJIN\n\nBohai\nSea\n\nHuanghua\n\nXining\n\nQINGHAI\n\nLanzhou\n\nSHENMU-YAN'AN RAILWAY\n\nGantang\n\nZhongwei\n\nNINGXIA\n\nTAIYUAN-ZHONGWEI RAILWAY\n\nYan\u2019an North\nSHANXI-XIAOLIU RAILWAY\n\nYuanping\n\nYulin\n\nTaiyuan\n\nShijiazhuang\n\nHengshui\n\nSuide\n\nYuci\nSHANXI\n\nMucun\n\nXiaoyi\n\nTunilu\n\nDezhou\nJinan\n\nShehe\nFengteng\n\nSHANDONG\n\nYantai\n\n35  00'No\n\nHancheng\n\nLinfen\n\nYueshan\nHouma\n\nXin Xiang\n\nJiaozuo\n\nZhengzhou\n\nJING-JIU RAILWAY\n\nQingdao\n\nYanzhou\n\nShijiusuo\n\nYellow  Sea\n\nLianyungang\n\nHeze\n\nLinyi\n\nXuzhou\n\nShangqiu\n\nGANSU\n\nZhongjiacun\n\nBaoji\n\nXi'an\n\nTongguan\n\nXinfeng\n\nHENAN\n\nQingling Tunnel\n\nHEFEI-XI'AN RAILWAY\n\nYangpingguan\n\nSHAANXI\n\nShangnan\nDanjiangkou\n\nAnkang\n\nGucheng\n\nZHENGZHOU-XI'AN RAILWAY\n\nXixia\n\nNanyang\n\nTongbai  Mountains\n\nXiaolin\n\nXinyang\n\nXiangfan\n\nHuangchuan\n\nFuyang\n\nDabie   Mountains\n\nLu'an\n\nHefei\n\nMacheng\n\nDaxian\n\nDAXIAN-WANXIAN RAILWAY\n\nLishan\nHUBEI\n\nJingmen\n\nHankou\n\n(Yangtze River)\n\nLichuan\n\nYichang\n\nWuhan\n\nWanzhou\n(Wanxian)\n\nCHONGQING\nFuling\nChongqing\n\nHuaiyuan\nScenic Area\n\nXinyi\n\nJIANGSU\n\nHuaiyuan\n\nYangping\n\nBengbu\n\nChangfeng\n\nHanan\n\nNanjing\nYixing\n\nNantong\n\nJiangyin\n\nSHANGHAI\n\nWuxi\n\nShanghai\n\nChangxing\n\nHangzhou\n\nWuhu\nANHUI\n\nAnqing\n\nHEFEI-JIUJIANG RAILWAY\n\nNingbo\n\nYICHANG-WANZHOU RAILWAY\n\nJiujiang\n\nZHEJIANG\n\nNanchang\n\nXiangtang\n\nSanjiangcheng\n\nYingtan\n\nChangsha\n\nLoudi\n\nYiyang\n\nWenzhou\n\nHuaihua\n\nHUNAN\n\nZhuzhou\n\nJIANGXI\n\nJi'an\n\nFUJIAN\n\nHenyang\n\nNanping\n\n25  00'No\n\nFuzhou\n\nGanzhou\n\nGANZHOU-LONGYAN RAILWAY\n\nXIZANG\n\nSICHUAN\n\nChengdu\n\nNeijiang\n\nYibin\n\nDALI-LIJIANG RAILWAY\n\ni a n g\n\nJ\n\n \n\nC h a n g  \n\nZhongdian\n\nLijiang\n\nLanping\n\nDukuo\n\nLiupanshui\n\nGUIZHOU\n\nGUIZHOU-SHUBAI RAILWAY\n\nZhanyi\n\nGuiyang\n\nBaiguo\nHongguo\n\nGuiding\n\nPingzha\n\nQujing\n\nWeishe\n\nBaoshan\n\nDali\n\n25  00'No\nRuili\n\nChuxiong\n\nYUNNAN\n\nKunming\n\nYiliang\n\nKaiyuan\n\nShiping\n\nLincang\n\nMohei\n\nJinghong\n\nGuilin\n\nLuocheng\n\nHechi\n\nSancha\n\nHeshan\n\nGUANGXI\n\nLiuzhou\nLaibin\nLitang\n\nDingnan\n\nLongyan\n\nXiamen\n\nMeizhou\n\nZhangzhou\n\nChaozhou\nShantou\n\nGUANG-MEI-SHAN RAILWAY\n\nLongchuan\n\nGUANGDONG\nGuangzhou\n\nSanshui\n\nChangping\n\nYunfu Yaogu\n\nNanning\n\nPing Xiang\n\nQinzhou\n\nFangcheng\n\nHepu\n\nHechun\n\nShenzhen\nKowloon\nHONG KONG SAR\n\nZhuhai\nMacao\n\nMACAO SAR\n\nMYANMAR\n\nVIET NAM\n\nBeihai\n\nZhakou\n\nMaoming\n\nZhanjiang\n\nYAOGU-MAOMING RAILWAY\n\nLAO PEOPLE'S\nDEMOCRATIC\nREPUBLIC\n\nN\n\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150 200 250\n\nKilometers\n\no\n100  00'E\n\nGulf  of\nTonkin\n\nYangpu\n\nSantang\n\nHaikou\n\nNada\n\nChahe\n\nBasou\n\nShilu\nHAINAN\n\nSanya\n\nSouth   China   Sea\n\nRailway Projects Financed by the\nAsian Development Bank\n\nNational Capital\n\nProvincial Capital\n\nCity/Town\n\nExisting Railway\n\nPlanned Railway\n\nCompleted\n\nUnder Construction\n\nProposed\n\nRiver\n\nProvincial Boundary\n\nInternational Boundary\n\nBoundaries are necessarily authoritative.\n\no\n120  00'E\n\n07-3467 HR\n\n\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n1. \nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  for  the  Railway  Safety  Enhancement  Project  (the \nProject). The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nA. \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n2. \nFrom 1978, when market-oriented economic reforms were introduced, through to 2006, \nthe  PRC  has  experienced  sustained  rapid  economic  growth,  which  has  resulted  in  a  rapid \nincrease  in  demand  for  transportation.  Annual  growth  of  passenger  transport  was  9%  and \nfreight  transport  grew  at  7.6%  during  1978\u20132006.  Railways  are  the  principal  mode  of  freight \ntransport  in  the  PRC.  In  2006,  the  modal  split  for  freight  ton-kilometer  (km)  was  47.5%  for \nrailways,  followed  by  27.9%  for  inland  waterways  and  seashore  shipping,  21.1%  for  roads, \n3.3% for pipelines, and 0.2% for civil aviation. In 2006, road traffic accounted for 52.8% of total \npassenger-km,  followed  by  railways  with  34.5%,  civil  aviation  with  12.3%,  and  coastal  and \ninland waterways with 0.4%.  \n \nThe railway is the primary mode of transport for long-distance and bulk transport. At the \n3. \nend of 2006, the PRC\u2019s railway system of 77,000 km comprised 63,400 km of national railways \nand 13,600 km of joint venture and local railways. The Ministry of Railways (MOR) operates the \nstate-owned  national  railway  as  an  integrated  system.  The  joint  venture  and  local  railways, \ncomprising regional lines within provincial boundaries, are constructed under the sponsorship of \nprovincial  governments  and/or  MOR  to  serve  local  needs  and  provide  interconnection  to  the \nnational railway network. Despite its large size, the railway network does not provide adequate \ncoverage for the country\u2019s population and land area.1 \n \n4. \nPRC railways have the highest freight transport density in the world and second highest \npassenger  transport  density  after  Japan.  Locomotive  turnover  is  the  highest  in  the  world. \nBetween 1978 and 2006, railway freight increased from 535 billion ton-km to 2,172 billion ton-\nkm,  equivalent  to  an  annual  growth  rate  of  5.14%.  Passenger  traffic  grew  at  6.65%  annually \nfrom 109 billion passenger-km to 666.2 billion passenger-km. For passenger trips, the average \nrailway journey increased from 134 km in 1978 to 535 km in 2006, compared with the average \nroad journey, which grew from 35 km to 55 km over the same period. For freight, the average \nrailway  journey  is  770  km,  compared  to  65  km  for  road  in  2006.  Despite  such  growth  rates, \nrailway capacity has lagged behind demand because of system constraints (Appendix 2). Given \nthe railways\u2019 important role in providing economic transportation, these will continue to be major \nconstraints  to  efficient  economic  growth  if  not  removed.  The  Government\u2019s  aggressive  plan  to \nimprove railways includes improving railway safety, modernizing technology, and expanding the \nrailway network. \n \nB. \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\n1. \n\nGovernment Strategy \n\n \n5. \nThe  Government's  policy  on  railway  development  focuses  on  (i)  removing  constraints \nand  expanding  the  system,  (ii)  encouraging  the  construction  of  joint  venture  local  railways  to \npromote  the  development  of  local  economies,  (iii)  improving  the  efficiency  and  safety  of  the \n                                                 \n1  The network density per 1,000 square km of land is one third that of India and one tenth that of Japan. \n\n \n\n\fexisting  system  by  using  new  technology  and  modern  management  tools  in  planning  and \noperation,  (iv)  reducing  operating  subsidies  through  appropriate  pricing  and  commercialization \nof  services,  (v)  initiating  institutional  and  structural  reforms  to  increase  autonomy  and \naccountability,  and  (vi)  encouraging  nongovernment  investment  in  infrastructure  and  related \nservices.  \n \n6. \nThe Tenth Five-Year Plan (FYP), 2001\u20132005, identified transportation, including railway \ndevelopment, as a priority. It envisaged (i) constructing 6,000 km of new lines to provide access \nto  unserved  areas  with  the  network  length  reaching  a  total  of  75,000  route-km;  (ii) providing \n3,000  km  of  double  lines  and  electrifying  5,000  km  of  key  lines  to  increase  capacity;  and \n(iii) increasing  operating  speeds  on  5,000  km  with  the  total  length  of  such  lines  reaching \n15,000 km.  By  the  end  of  2005,  an  investment  of  CNY308  billion  had  been  made  for  capital \nconstruction,  which  included  (i)  constructing  6,458  km  of  new  lines,  (ii)  providing  3,275  km  of \ndouble lines, and (iii) electrifying 6,259 km of tracks. \n \n7. \nIn  2004,  the  State  Council  approved  the  new  Railway  Development  Plan  covering  the \nperiod  up  to  2020.  The  plan  seeks  to  expand  the  railway  network  to  100,000  km  by  2020. \nPriority  will  be  given  to  the  development  of  railways  in  unserved  areas  and  regions  that  lack \ntransport  and  have  remained  less  developed.  The  route  network  length  will  increase  by \n16,000 km in the western region of the PRC to reach a network length of 40,000 km by 2020. \nThe plan identifies enhancing safety as a major goal. It seeks to ensure a high level of safety \nperformance  in  infrastructure  construction  and  construction  services  by:  (i)  strictly  adhering  to \nsafety  regulations,  (ii)  strengthening  transport  safety  by  using  modern  and  better  quality \nequipment,  (iii)  proper  training  of  staff,  (iv)  improving  staff  education  and  technical  skills, \n(v) strengthening  responsibility  and  accountability  for  safety  in  railway  transportation,  and \n(vi) comprehensive management of public security.  \n \n8. \nThe Eleventh FYP, 2006\u20132010, continues to emphasize railway development and seeks \nto speed up railway construction. The plan envisages constructing 17,000 km of new lines; 45% \nof the network length will be double track and electrified. The plan seeks to (i) build a dedicated \npassenger railway network through the construction of 7,000 km of passenger dedicated lines \nby  2010,  (ii)  develop  coal  transport  corridors  by  increasing  the  capacity  of  existing  lines, \n(iii) expand  the  railway  network  in  the  poor  western  region  (to  reach  34,000  km),  (iv)  build \ninternational  corridors  at  the  borders  in  the  southwest  and  northwest,  and  (v)  develop  a \ncountrywide intermodal container network. Given the rapid development of the network, the plan \nseeks  to  enhance  safety  and  security  over  the  railway  network.  A  total  investment  of \nCNY1.5 trillion  or  about  $190  billion  (CNY1.25  trillion  for  construction  and  CNY250  billion  for \nrolling stock) is planned over the next 5-year period. \n \n\n2. \n\nAsian Development Bank Strategy and Sector Experience \n\n \n9. \nThe Asian Development Bank (ADB) strategy for the railway sector focuses on helping \n(i)  expand  the  railway  system  by  constructing  new  lines  in  unserved,  less  developed  areas; \n(ii) modernize  railways,  enhance  safety,  and  increase  capacity  to  improve  efficiency  on  key \nroutes of the national railway system; (iii) commercialize railway operations to sustain efficient \noperations; (iv) promote energy conservation and environmental sustainability; and (v) increase \nrailway  competitiveness  in  the  transport  sector  through  restructuring  and  reform.  ADB  has \nfocused  on  the  development  of  railways  in  poor,  less-developed  inland  provinces  to  promote \n\n2 \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n3\n\nsustainable  economic  growth  and  reduce  poverty.2 ADB  has  provided  14  loans  totaling  about \n$2.9 billion to finance the construction of about 1,921 km of eight provincial railways operated by \njoint  ventures  with  MOR,  and  5,541  km  of  new  railway  lines  under  the  six  national  railway \nprojects (Appendix 4). The Project, designed to enhance safety and promote economic growth \nby providing safe and reliable railway transportation, is consistent with the PRC\u2019s development \npriorities and the ADB strategy. \n \n10. \nPolicy  Dialogue. Policy dialogue has been a feature of ADB assistance to the railway \nsector  and  has  effectively  complemented  the  lending  operations.  Since  1989,  13  technical \nassistance  (TA)  initiatives  totaling  $6.1  million  have  been  provided  for  developing  the \nemergency  management  system  on  the  PRC  railway  network,  institutional  development  of \ndedicated  passenger  lines  and  local  railways,  tariff  and  organizational  studies  for  the  Jing\u2013Jiu \nrailway,  enhancement  of  commercial  and  business  operations,  marketing  and  business \ndevelopment,  human  resource  development,  and  improvement  of  financial  management  and \naccounting  systems  (Appendix  6).  ADB  policy  dialogue  with  MOR  focuses  on  (i)  poverty \nreduction  as  the  overarching  objective  of  ADB  operations,  (ii)  full  compliance  with  ADB \nsafeguard  policies,  (iii)  enhancing  railway  safety,  (iv)  promoting  energy  conservation  and \nenvironmental  sustainability,  (v)  sector  reforms,  (vi)  marketing  and  business  development, \n(vii) private  sector  participation  and  nongovernment  financing,  and  (viii)  regional  cooperation. \nThe railway development plan defines the major goals for the PRC railways to 2020, and is in \nbroad  agreement  with  ADB\u2019s  strategic  agenda.  MOR\u2019s  proposed  reform  agenda  for  this  plan \nseeks to (i) study and learn from the best international practices gained worldwide, (ii) separate \ncore  operations  from  noncore  transportation  businesses,  (iii)  rationalize  and  reduce  staff, \n(iv) reform  the  railway  investment  and  financing  system,  and  (v)  establish  specialized \ntransportation companies. \n \n11.  MOR  has  adopted  a  structured  approach  to  railway  reform.  In  1999,  using  a  new \nmanagement  concept\u2014the  asset  operating  liability  system\u2014MOR  entered  into  management \ncontracts with railway administrations to improve profitability (as a pilot project). The contracts \nhelped  improve  operational  and  financial  performance;  this  approach  was  subsequently \nextended  to  all  railway  administrations.  Separation  of  core  and  noncore  businesses  is  a  key \nelement  of  MOR\u2019s  restructuring  program.  The  total  number  of  employees  in  the  core \ntransportation  business  was  reduced  from  1.89  million  in  1997  to  1.41  million  in  2006.  In  the \nnoncore  transportation  business,  five  large  companies  employing  616,500  staff  have  been \ndivested.  To  provide  jobs  for  redundant  staff,  by  the  end  of  2006  MOR  had  set  up \n3,625 diversified businesses (independent of the core transportation business) employing more \nthan  321,544  staff  to  supply  equipment,  goods,  and  services  to  the  railway  industry.  In  1998, \nMOR initiated a cost-sharing scheme for health insurance and pensions for railway employees. \nIn 2005, MOR completed the transfer of 822 primary and middle schools, 46 vocational schools, \nand  181  nursery  schools;  and  260  hospitals  and  medical  units  to  local  governments.  One \nhundred branch lines comprising 7,800 km were separated to improve productivity and reduce \noperating  losses.  The  reform  agenda  matrix  is  in  Appendix  7.  Supplementary  Appendix  A \nincludes a chronology of railway reforms. \n \nPoverty  Reduction. The strategic purpose of ADB involvement in the railway sector is \n12. \nto create the conditions for sustainable economic growth to help improve living standards. ADB-\nfinanced projects are located in unserved areas of the central and western part of the PRC, and \nhave  the  potential  for  economic  growth  once  improved,  cost-effective  transport  access  is \n\n                                                 \n2  ADB.  2000.  Technical  Assistance  for  Assessing  the  Impact  of  Transport  and  Energy  Infrastructure  on  Poverty \nReduction.  Manila.  The  findings  conclude  that  completed  railway  projects  supported  general  economic  growth  in \nthe region and led to small areas of high economic growth in towns served by railway stations. \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\n \n\nprovided. Identifying ways to enhance the poverty reduction impact has been an integral part of \nADB  interventions.  Specific  features  in  project  planning  and  design  include  (i)  providing \nemployment  during  construction  and  operation  of  the  railways  on  a  preferential  basis  to  poor \nworkers, including women;3 (ii) utilizing locally produced materials that meet the requirements of \nquality and economy (e.g., sand, stone, cement); (iii) adding provisions for railway station area \ndevelopment;  (iv)  providing  station  access  roads  and  construction  access  roads;  and \n(v) supporting  poverty  reduction  programs  of  local  governments.4 ADB-financed  projects  have \nbeen complemented with local government development programs, such as improving the road \nnetwork and transport services in the project area concurrently with the Project, and these have \nhelped  increase  the  welfare  gains  for  the  poor,  including  women,  and  help  spread  project \nbenefits to the poverty villages. \n \nEnergy  Conservation  and  Environmental  Sustainability.  Beginning  2006,  an \n13. \nimportant  element  of  ADB  policy  dialogue  with  MOR  has  been  the  enhancement  of  energy \nconservation  and  environmental  sustainability.  The  Eleventh  FYP  of  the  Government  also \nidentifies  energy  conservation  and  environmental  sustainability  as  the  two  important  areas  of \nsustainable  development,  and  seeks  to  formulate  plans  and  actions  to  achieve  this.  The \nemphasis  of  ADB  dialogue  has  focused  on  creating  awareness  on  these  two  issues  and \nincludes factors such as energy savings and environmental improvements in the evaluation of \nperformance  of  railway  administrations  and  other  entities.  The  dialogue  encourages  adopting \nenergy  efficient  technologies  and  environmental  improvements  in  railway  construction, \noperation,  and  maintenance.  Use  of  fuel-efficient  locomotives;  double-stack  container  trains; \ncreating  \u201cgreen  corridors\u201d;  environment-friendly  waste  disposal;  environment-friendly  station \ndesign; and use of fuel-efficient, environment-friendly safety, and maintenance equipments are \nsome of the areas integrated in the ADB-financed project design. This area has been of mutual \ninterest to other development partners such as the World Bank, French Development Agency, \nand  German  development  cooperation \nf\u00fcr  Wiederaufbau.  Close \ncoordination has been maintained with them. \n \n14. \nEnhancing  Safety. Safety is an integral part of providing competitive, high quality, and \nreliable  transportation  for  people  and  goods.  As  PRC  railways  have  modernized,  introduced \nnew  concepts  and  technologies,  and  increased  speeds,  the  safety  needs  have  changed.  The \nEleventh FYP of MOR recognizes this important aspect and seeks to promote integrated safety \nmanagement, information network security, and an emergency management system consistent \nwith  the  development  needs  of  the  PRC  railways.  It  seeks  to  attract  foreign  technology  and \nexpertise  to  meet  these  needs.  ADB  policy  dialogue  with  MOR  emphasizes  the  need  for \noperational  reforms  for  the  rail  network,  including  enhancing  safety  in  construction,  operation, \nand  maintenance.  MOR  and  ADB  support  the  safety  and  security  objective  on  PRC  railways \nthrough  introduction  of  modern  technologies,  policy  development,  legislation,  monitoring,  and \nenforcement and outreach activities (Appendix 3). Since 2003, ADB has supported investments \nin  railway  safety  as  part  of  ADB  financing,  and  has  worked  closely  with  the  safety  and \ntransportation  departments  of  MOR  to  develop  a  comprehensive  plan  on  the  institutional, \ninvestment,  and  training  needs  for  safety  in  PRC  railways.  ADB  also  initiated  dialogue  on \nadopting  a  sector-wide  approach  on  safety  rather  than  a  project-based  approach.  Adopting  a \nsector-wide approach is consistent with the network approach adopted for railway operations in \n                                                 \n3  In the Guizhou\u2013Shuibai Railway Project, the proportion of the poor in unskilled labor was 41% on average and 64% \nduring peak construction.

Manila.  \n\nthrough  Kreditanstalt \n\n4  Some completed projects reported that about 40% of the poor at appraisal were raised above the poverty line upon \nproject completion, e.g., in the case of the Hefei\u2013Jiujiang Railway Project, 41% of the poor were raised above the \npoverty  line.  ADB.  1993. Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors  on  a  Proposed \nLoan to the People\u2019s Republic of China for the Hefei\u2013Jiujiang Railway Project. Manila. \n\n\f \n\n5\n\nthe  PRC;  and  helps  in providing  economies  of  scale  and  better  management  of  emergencies, \npreventive maintenance, and accidents.  \n \n15. \nAn  important  element  of  the  sector-wide  approach  to  safety  is  the  management  of \nvarious  kinds  of  emergencies,  disasters,  and  accidents  at  different  levels  of  management \n(ministry,  railway  administration,  and  railway  station).  MOR  has  an  established  system  of \nhandling  railway  accidents  at  the  three  levels  (Appendix  5).  However,  the  system  to  deal  with \nemergencies and natural disasters (e.g., earthquakes, typhoons, or other natural calamities) is \nin a nascent stage. It was only after the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome in 2003 \nthat  MOR  first  planned  setting  up  a  mechanism  at  the  national  level  to  deal  with  natural \ndisasters  and  major  emergencies  (e.g.,  earthquakes,  typhoons,  and  other  natural  calamities). \nMOR made a start in 2005 by establishing an emergency management office directly under the \ncontrol  of  the  minister  (as  part  of  the  minister\u2019s  office).  In  2006,  an  emergency  management \ncenter was established under the transportation department.  \n \n16.  Managing  emergencies  and  crises  on  a  technologically  advanced  high-speed  railway \nsystem  is  a  new  concept  for  PRC  railways,  and  managing  such  a  network  is  different  from \nmanaging  the  conventional  railway  system.  MOR  has  limited  experience  in  emergency  and \ncrisis management, so it sought to learn from international experience and best practices. The \nGovernment  and  MOR  requested  ADB  assistance  in  researching  and  learning  from  best \ninternational  practices  on  an  emergency  management  system  in  advanced  railway  systems  in \ndeveloped countries, and help in adapting them to PRC railways. ADB has provided a TA grant \nof $500,000 to help develop an emergency management system on PRC railways.5 \n \nSector Reforms. ADB is supporting institutional reform of the railway sector to separate \n17. \ngovernment  and  enterprise  functions,  giving  full  play  to  market  forces  and  increasing  the \ncompetitiveness  of  the railways.  ADB  has  actively  pursued  (i)  separation  of  the  core  transport \nbusiness  from  the  noncore  transport  business,  (ii)  segmentation  of  passenger  and  freight \nservices,  and  (iii)  strengthening  of  the  recently  corporatized  specialized  transportation \ncompanies.  As  part  of  ADB\u2019s  policy  dialogue  with  MOR,  three  large  companies  handling \ncontainers,  special  goods,  and  express  parcel  have  been  set  up. 6  Setting  up  passenger-\ndedicated  corridors  with  a  separate  institutional  structure  is  a  key  ADB  intervention.7 ADB  is \nassisting  in  developing  the  institutional,  marketing,  business  development,  and  technical \nstandards for such initiatives.8  \n \n18. \nRationalization  of  staff  and  reduction  of  transportation  and  non-transportation  staff  is \nalso being pursued. On 18 March 2005, under a major restructuring exercise, MOR abolished \n41 sub-railway administration bureaus, thereby reducing one tier of railway management. By the \nend  of  2006,  the  number  of  stations  and  sections  were  reduced  from  1,500  to  695.  This  has \nhelped reduce 22,000 staff, rationalize operations, improve productivity, and enhance efficiency. \n\n                                                 \n5  ADB.  2007.

The TA is ongoing. \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\n \n\nRecent ADB interventions have supported operational reforms and emphasized railway safety\u2014\nincluding  the  introduction  of  safe  and  reliable  technology,  upgrading  speeds,  introducing \ndedicated  passenger  and  freight  lines,  a  modern  dispatch  control  system,  and  high  quality \ninformation  systems  on  the  PRC  railway  network.  The  PRC\u2019s  accession  to  the  World  Trade \nOrganization has intensified competition among different modes of transport and the structure of \ntransport demand is likely to change.9 ADB is providing an advisory TA for policy reform support \nto  MOR,10 which  is  analyzing  the  conflicting  roles  of  meeting  social  obligations  and  making \nprofits,  increasing  modal  competition,  impacts  caused  by  the  fast  pace  of  urbanization  and \neconomic  development,  and  demand  for  delivery  of  improved  services.  During  project \nprocessing,  coordination  was  maintained  with  the  World  Bank,  French  Development  Agency, \nand German development cooperation through Kreditanstalt f\u00fcr Wiederaufbau; and a common \napproach  to  reforms  and  assistance  was  developed.  This  will  be  continued  during  project \nimplementation. \n \n19.  Marketing  and  Business  Development.  As  the  PRC  progresses  to  a  market-driven \neconomy, the railways need to compete on the basis of price and service quality for demand-\nbased transportation services. New marketing and business development initiatives are needed \nboth for freight and passenger services to be competitive. In past projects, ADB has supported \nproject-specific studies  to  create  marketing  and business  development  opportunities,  including \nskills and knowledge for market-oriented operation and awareness of profitable operations. ADB \nis  supporting  the  development  of  marketing  and  business  strategies  for  dedicated  passenger \nlines,11 7,000 km of which is to be completed by 2010. The first dedicated passenger line from \nBeijing to Tianjin is expected to start operation by August 2008.  \n \nPrivate  Sector  Participation.  ADB\u2019s  policy  dialogue  encourages  increased  private \n20. \nsector  participation  in  the  railway  sector.  ADB  is  assisting  MOR  with  a  study  to  examine \nopportunities  for  diversified  financing  sources,  increased  private  sector  involvement,  and  the \npossibility of public-private partnerships in the PRC railway sector. In 2005 and 2006, the State \nCouncil and MOR issued guidelines on facilitating the investment and financing system reforms, \nwhich  seek  to  reduce  the  threshold  of  the  investment,  encourage  the  private  sector  to  invest, \nand  welcome  strategic  investors  in  railway  financing. 12 Strategic  and  private  investors 13 are \nparticipating in the project equity of the ADB-financed Taiyuan\u2013Zhongwei Railway Project.14 In \n2006, an initial public offering for Daqin railway company (CNY15 billion) was made, which was \nheavily oversubscribed.  \n \n \n \nThe  evaluation 15  of  ADB  assistance  for  the  PRC  transport  sector  assessed  ADB\u2019s \n21. \nrailways  program  \u201csuccessful\u201d.  The  evaluation  noted  that  ADB\u2019s  strategic  priorities  were  well \n\nLessons  \n\n3. \n\n                                                 \n9  Since opening up the freight transport market to foreign companies under World Trade Organization commitments, \n\ntwo joint venture companies with foreign participation have entered the market.  \n\n10 ADB. 2005.

Its  overall  focus  of  building  railways  using \nmodern  technologies  addressed  needs  to  increase  railway  capacity  and  reduce  the  persistent \ngap  between  demand  and  supply  as  quickly  and  efficiently  as  possible.  ADB\u2019s  priority  of \nimproving  efficiency  and  commercial  orientation,  and  its  emphasis  on  restructuring  and \nreforming policy, was well matched to evolving institutional reforms in railways. \n \n22. \nExperience  from  completed  and  ongoing  ADB-financed  railway  projects  in  the  PRC \nshowed  strong  commitment  and  satisfactory  capabilities  of  executing  agencies  for  project \nimplementation.  The  speed  of  implementation  generally  exceeded  expectations  at  appraisal, \nand  agencies  generally  complied  with  loan  covenants.  Resettlement  and  environmental \nmanagement  were  carried  out  satisfactorily.  Audit  covenants  were  complied  with  in  a  timely \nmanner, and the audited financial statements were generally acceptable (Appendix 8). Of the 14 \nADB-supported  railway  projects,  9  have  been  completed, 16  1  has  started  commercial \noperations,17 and 4 are under implementation.18 \n \n23. \nPrevious  railway  projects  have  contributed  to  socioeconomic  development  in  the \nprojects\u2019  influence  areas.  The  main  impacts  are  as  follows:  (i)  new  railway  lines  in  less \ndeveloped regions stimulated economic development, resulting in higher growth rates of gross \ndomestic  product  (GDP)  and  rural  incomes  compared  with  the  without-project  scenario; 19 \n(ii) construction  activities  generated  demand  for  unskilled  labor  and  employment  of  poor \nremained  unemployed  or \nworkers, \n\nincluding  women,  who  would  have  otherwise \n\n                                                 \n16  ADB.  1989.

Rural income per capita in Xinfeng County increased from CNY802 in 1993 to CNY2,222 in \n1998, an annual increase of 18.5% compared with 10.3% during 1985\u20131992 (before the project). \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nunderemployed;20 (iii)  service  roads  built  for  construction  activities  opened  up  and  benefited \nrural communities in inaccessible areas; (iv) domestic resource mobilization improved, providing \nadditional  resources  for  social  programs 21  and  generating  employment;  (v)  supply  and \ntransportation of local materials; (vi) improved and lower cost transport resulted in lower prices \nof agricultural inputs (such as fertilizers), which stimulated cash-crop farming and provided more \nincome  to  farmers;  increased  the  mobility  of  rural  residents;  and  allowed  access  to  more \nmarkets,  employment  opportunities,  and  social  services  beyond  the  immediate  communities; \n(vii)  counties  provided  with  new  railway  access  recorded  higher  GDP  growth  rates  than  other \ncounties;  (viii)  the  investment  environment  was  enhanced,  resulting  in  rapid  development  of \nsecondary and tertiary industries that generated employment;22 (ix) the consequent shift in the \nstructure of employment from low productivity agriculture to higher productivity agroprocessing \nand  light  industry  increased  employment  opportunities  for  women  whose  incomes  and  social \nstatus  then  improved; 23  (x)  tourism  developed  because  of  more  affordable  and  convenient \nrailway travel; and (xi) environmental protection and mitigation measures were taken under the \nprojects in accordance with the environmental impact assessments for the projects. The railway \nprojects have contributed to a transformation of  the local economies: per capita rural incomes \nincreased  substantially,  living  standards  improved,  and  poverty  reduced.  The  lessons  learned \nand experiences gained are incorporated in the current project design. \n \n\n4. \n\nRationale \n\n24. \nThe  project  rationale  reflects  ADB\u2019s  railway  sector  operational  strategy  for  the  PRC, \nwhich  includes  promoting  sustainable  economic  growth  by  improving  the  efficiency  of  the \nrailway  transport  through  reducing  railway  network  constraints  and  enhancing  railway  safety. \nThe  Project  is  the  first  stand-alone  intervention  by  ADB  for  enhancing  railway  safety  on  a \nnetwork  basis  and  will  pursue  the  operational  reforms,  including  emphasis  on  safety,  with  the \nintroduction  of  safe,  reliable,  and  modern  technology  on  the  railway  network;  improved \nreliability;  higher  mobility;  increased  network  capacity;  optimal  use  of  the  network  and  assets; \nand increased staff productivity. All of these will lead to higher efficiency of railway transport. \n \n25. \nSafety is an important aspect of reliable transportation and a critical part of providing a \ncompetitive, high quality, and safe mode of transport for people and goods. The PRC, a country \nwith  diverse  geology  and  challenging  environment,  has  two  thirds  of  its  areas  threatened  by \nfloods;  nearly  half  of  the  cities  located  in  the  seismic  belt;  more  mountainous  area  than  plain \nareas;  great  elevation  differences  between  east  and  west;  frequent  geological  disasters,  such \nas  landslides  and  flow  of  debris;  frequent  typhoons  in  the  southern  part;  frequent  sandstorms \nand  windstorms  in  the  western  part;  and  snowstorms  in  the  northern  part.  PRC  railways \ncrisscross the length and breadth of the country, and this working environment makes managing \nsafety on the PRC railways a technical and human challenge.  \n\n                                                 \n20  During the first 2 years of construction of the Guizhou\u2013Shuibai Railway (footnote 15), a total of about 7.5 million \nperson-days of employment was generated, of which 4.1 million person-days (about 55%) were provided to local \npoor people, thereby raising them above the poverty line. \n\n21  The  financial  revenue  of  10  poverty  counties  in  Jiangxi  Province  that  are  traversed  by  the  Jing\u2013Jiu  Railway \n(footnote  15)  increased  from  CNY0.5  billion  in  1993  to  CNY1.4  billion  in  1998,  an  annual  increase  of  22.7% \ncompared with 12.3% during 1985\u20131992, before construction of the Jing\u2013Jiu Railway. \n\n22  The Jing\u2013Jiu Railway facilitated setting up many resource- and agriculture-based industries in Xingfeng County of \nJiangxi  Province\u2014from  3  in  1992  to  39  in  1998,  after  project  completion.  The  number  of  businesses  grew  from \n8,005  in  1992  to  19,287  in  1998,  and  the  number  of  persons  employed  in  these  businesses  increased  from \n18,484 in  1992  to  52,153  in  1998\u2014an  annual  increase  of  23%.  In  the  same  county,  the  number  of  people  living \nbelow the poverty line was reduced from 30,400 in 1993 to 11,580 in 1998, a decline of 62%. \n\n23 Beneficial  income  and  social  impacts,  particularly  on  women,  were  noted  in  the  influence  areas  of  the  Yaogu\u2013\n\nMaoming Railway (footnote 15) and Guang\u2013Mei\u2013Shan Railway (footnote 15). \n\n \n\n\f \n\n9\n\nAs  PRC  railways  have  modernized,  introduced  new  concepts  and  technologies,  and \n26. \nincreased  speeds,  the  safety  needs  have  changed.  In  April  2007,  train  speeds  were  raised  to \n200 km/hour (h) and 250 km/h after the sixth speedup on the PRC railway network. In 2008, the \nBeijing\u2013Tianjin dedicated passenger line, with a speed of more than 200 km/h, will be put into \noperation. Train speeds on dedicated passenger lines are expected to be increased to 300 km/h \nby 2010. Trains with higher trailing loads have been introduced on the Daqin railway line. MOR \nseeks to introduce double-stack container operation under electrified traction on the Shanghai\u2013\nChengdu corridor by 2012. By 2010, MOR seeks to set up 19,600 km of nationwide passenger \nand intercity express corridor with speed capabilities of 200 km/h and above, introduce heavy-\nhaul long freight trains with higher axle loads, increase locomotive and rolling stock utilization, \nand reduce wagon turnaround time.  \n \n27.  Managing accidents, emergencies, and crises on a technologically advanced high-speed \nrailway  system\u2014consisting  of  a  high-speed  dedicated  passenger  network 24  and  a  heavily \nloaded  freight  network  in  a  difficult  and  challenging  environment\u2014needs  an  emergency \nmanagement system (emergency rescue and restoration system for dealing with accidents and \nemergencies  on  PRC  railway  network)  that  is  reliable,  technically  more  advanced  and  less \nvulnerable  to  human  error.  The  system  should  be  able  to  undertake  the  restoration  and \nmaintenance  work  more  quickly  with  a  high  degree  of  reliability  and  be  able  to  respond  to \nemergency  situations  quickly.  Delays  in  rescue  and  inefficient  restoration  can  lead  to  loss  of \nlives, heavy damages to goods and people, and prolonged disruption of traffic movement on the \nrailway  network,  affecting  railway  efficiency  and  preventing  railways  from  capitalizing  on  their \ncomparative advantages. \n \nAlthough the current system of emergency rescue and restoration on the PRC railways \n28. \nseems to work (Appendix 5), it has severe limitations to meet the requirements of the advanced \nrailway  network  under  development  in  the  PRC.  Some  of  the  major  limitations  are  as  follows: \n(i) the  location  of  rescue  and  restoration  centers  is  not  commensurate  with  the  traffic  flow \ndensity  and  the  range  of  operation  is  small  (200  km),  (ii)  the  design  capacity  of  rescue  and \nrestoration equipment is limited, (iii) equipment is old and actual capacity is less than the design \ncapacity, (iv) mobile speed of the rescue and restoration equipment is much less (maximum is \nonly  85  km/h)  compared  to  train  speed  of  200\u2013250  km/h,  (v)  the  operational  speed  of  the \nequipment is low, (vi) safety during operation and lifting functions are not reliable, and (vii) the \nrescue  and  restoration  time  is  long.  All  of  these  affect  the  safety,  reliability,  mobility,  and  line \ncapacity of the PRC railways. \n \nThe Project will help MOR improve the emergency management system by providing a \n29. \nquick, responsive rescue and restoration system on the entire railway network. The Project will \n(i)  rationalize  the  location  of  the  rescue  and  restoration  centers  (the  location  will  be  adjusted \naccording  to  traffic  flows  and  the  number  of  locations  will  be  reduced  from  175  to  136); \n(ii) procure  equipment  that  is  the  latest  available  in  the  market,  with  a  much  higher  capacity \nconsistent  with  the  needs  of  current  development  in  PRC  railways;  (iii)  have  higher  operating \nspeeds (120 km/h) and lifting capacity; (iv) be provided with a safety protection system for lifting \nand operation; (v) have a self-diagnostic system; and (vi) be more versatile. All these features \nwill help in reducing the rescue and restoration time for accidents and emergencies significantly. \nThe  equipment  to  be  procured  is  energy-efficient  and  environment-friendly.

About 250 staff will \nbe trained in the use of equipment. \n \n30. \nThe  implementation  will  be  done  in  phases.  First,  all  railway  administrations  will  be \nprovided with the proposed equipment, followed by the main lines, heavy-haul busy lines, and \nthen  the  complete  network.  The  complete  network  will  be  covered  by  2012.  When  completed, \nthe Project will improve the capacity of rescue and restoration from natural disasters, accidents, \nand  other  emergencies;  help  minimize  the  economic  losses;  and  help  protect  the  health  and \nlives of the people.  \n \n31. \nThe Project is a key intervention in the railway sector, with many technical, operational, \nsafety, and economic benefits. It seeks to introduce modern technology for enhanced safety on \na network basis, increase the throughput, and improve the reliability\u2014all of which will lead to a \nmore  affordable,  faster,  cheap,  safe,  energy-efficient,  and  more  environment-friendly  mode  of \ntransport  in  the  PRC.  ADB  intervention  in  financing  safety  systems  is  also  expected  to  play  a \ncatalytic  role  in  facilitating  the  flow  of  further  foreign  capital  to  finance  the  safety  and \nmaintenance needs of PRC railways.25 \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n32. \nThe impact of the proposed Project is an efficient, safe, reliable, and competitive railway \ntransport  system  developed  in  the  PRC.  The  outcome  of  the  Project  will  be  an  efficient  and \neffective  railway  emergency  management  system  on  the  PRC  railway  network.  This  will  be \nachieved  by  introducing  safe,  reliable,  energy-efficient,  and  environmental-friendly  emergency \nrescue  and  restoration  technologies;  providing  capacity  building  support  through  staff  training; \nand rationalizing the location of the comprehensive emergency rescue and restoration centers\u2014\nall  of  which  will  help  in  developing  a  more  responsive,  quicker,  and  efficient  rescue  and \nrestoration system for dealing with accidents and emergencies on the PRC railway network. \n \nB. \n\nOutputs \n\n33. \nThe  Project  comprises  (i)  supply  and  installation  of  railway  emergency  rescue  and \nrestoration equipment, (ii) capacity building and training, and (iii) institutional development. ADB \nwill  finance  (i)  procurement  of  modern  emergency  rescue  and  restoration  equipment  that  can \nrespond  to  emergencies  more  quickly,  efficiently,  and  effectively;  and  (ii) capacity  building, \nincluding  staff  training.  At  an  institutional  level,  MOR  will  rationalize  the  location  of  the \ncomprehensive emergency rescue and restoration centers (modern emergency and restoration \nequipment  will  be  located  in  these  centers)  by  reducing  the  number  of  locations  from  175  to \n136, and increasing the zone of influence of the equipment from 200 km to 250 km on the PRC \nrailway network. About 250 staff will be well trained in the use of this equipment. The key inputs \nneeded for project implementation include equipment, installation, and MOR staff. \n \nC. \n\nSpecial Features \n\n34. \nNetwork  Approach  to  Safety.  ADB  policy  dialogue  has  emphasized  the  need  for \noperational  reforms  for  the  rail  network,  including  enhancing  safety,  by  introducing  safe  and \n\n                                                 \n25 ADB financing of the Zhengzhou\u2013Xi\u2019an dedicated passenger line in September 2005 attracted keen interest from \nother  development  partners  such  as  the  World  Bank,  French  Development  Agency,  and  German  development \ncooperation through Kreditanstalt f\u00fcr Wiederaufbau, which are now financing similar dedicated passenger lines. \n\n\f \n\n11\n\nreliable technology, modernizing maintenance systems, and capacity building. Since 2003, ADB \nhas  supported  investments  in  railway  safety  as  part  of  ADB-financed  projects  and  financed \nsafety  components  in  Dali\u2013Lijiang  Railway  Project,  Zhengzhou\u2013Xi\u2019an  Railway  Project,  and \nTaiyuan\u2013Zhongwei Railway Project. This Project, however, seeks to adopt a network approach \nto safety and is a stand-alone sector-wide investment support for strengthening the emergency \nrescue  and  restoration  management  system  on  the  PRC  railway  network.  At  an  institutional \nlevel, MOR will rationalize the location of the comprehensive emergency rescue and restoration \ncenters  (modern  emergency  and  restoration  equipment  will  be  located  in  these  centers)  by \nreducing the number of locations, and increasing the zone of influence of the centers. Adopting \na sector-wide approach is consistent with the network approach adopted for train operations in \nthe PRC; and helps in providing economies of scale, and better management of emergencies, \npreventive maintenance, and accidents.  \n \n35. \nNew  Technologies.  The  Project  will  introduce  new  and  modern  technologies.  The \nequipment to be procured will be the latest available in the market, with a much higher capacity, \nconsistent with the needs of current development in the PRC railways. It will be energy-efficient \nand environment-friendly; have higher operating speeds (120 km/h) and lifting capacity; have a \nsafety protection system for lifting and operation and a self-diagnostic system; and will be more \nversatile. It can work in very cold temperatures (below \u201325\u02da centigrade), in tunnels and bridges, \nand under electrified traction. All these features will help in reducing the rescue and restoration \ntime  for  accidents  and  emergencies  significantly.  The  equipment  to  be  procured  is  not \nmanufactured nationally, and will be procured from the international market.  \n \n36. \nComprehensive  Rescue  and  Restoration  Centers.  Each  of  the  centers  will  be \ndeveloped  into  a  comprehensive  rescue  and  restoration  center;  and  will  have  a  set  of  rail-\nmounted  rescue  and  restoration  equipment,  tunnel  rescue  equipment,  passenger  rescue \nequipment, power generation car, tool car, medical car, and staff car. They will be formed into a \nmobile  rescue  and  restoration  unit  and  will  be  able  to  operate  at  speeds  of  120  km/h  (current \nspeed is about 50 km/h). The centers will be stocked with adequate spares and consumables \nfor reliable operation and maintenance of the equipment; have adequate staff well trained in the \nuse  of  the  equipment  and  dealing  with  accidents  and  emergencies;  and  have  the  necessary \nmaintenance facilities and well-trained staff to maintain the equipment. This configuration will be \nplaced on all the railway administrations, six main lines, heavy-haul busy lines, and the rest of \nthe network by 2012.   \n \n37. \nCapacity  Development. Enhancing staff capacity is a key objective of the Project. The \nrescue center set up by each of the railway administrations (18 in total) will become centers for \ntraining of staff in rescue and restoration equipment and skills. These centers, in addition to the \nemergency  and  rescue  and  restoration  equipment  located  in  these  rescue  bases,  will  be \nequipped  with  simulators,  training  models,  technical  literature,  and  track  for  test  operating  the \nequipment. The centers will organize special courses for staff in the operation and maintenance \nof  this  equipment.  The  Project  also  includes  capacity  development  programs  consisting  of \n(i) overseas  training  during  the  equipment  manufacturing  period,  (ii)  on-site  training  during \ninstallation  and  before  commencement  of  regular  operation,  and  (iii)  training  of  staff  at  the \nabove  emergency  rescue  centers.  About  250  staff  will  be  trained  in  the  use  of  the  above \nequipment. Technical exchanges on advanced technologies and new maintenance techniques \nare proposed to be organized to familiarize and educate staff in the operation and maintenance \nof this equipment.  \n \n38. \nPromoting  Good  Governance.  To  deliver  on  high  levels  of  safety  and  security  in \nrailway transportation requires upholding and demonstrating the principles of good governance, \n\n \n\n\f12 \n\n \n\n \n\nthe  emergency \ntransparency,  and  results-based  programs.  Setting  up \naccountability, \nmanagement  system  will  promote  good  governance,  as  it  will  help  consolidate  the  different \nfunctions under a single unit. The centers will act as one financial unit, offering better financial \nmanagement  and  accounting  control.  Administratively,  they  will  be  easier  to  manage,  as  they \nwill  follow  similar  management  control  and  have  management  autonomy.  They  will  have  well-\ndefined functions and clear targets, which will make them accountable for activities under their \ncontrol.  They  will  support  human  resources  development  through  the  training  functions,  which \nwill  be  delegated  to  each  of  the  18  rescue  centers.  All  of  these  steps  will  help  promote  good \ngovernance  and  achieve  the  long-term  objective  of  continuously  improving  the  high  level  of \nsafety on the PRC railway network, thereby achieving a high level of customer confidence in the \nPRC railway safety strategies. ADB-financed consulting services will assist in strengthening the \ninstitutional and capacity development functions of the emergency management system. \n \n39. \nReforms.  ADB  has  engaged  MOR  in  dialogue  aimed  at  enhancing  policy  reforms  in \nrailway  safety  during  project  processing.  Significant  progress  has  been  achieved  and  MOR \nadopted a new Railway Safety Law on 1 September 2007, which provides an increased impetus \nto  railway  safety.  The  classification  of  railway  accidents  has  been  revised  to  include  multiple \nfactors  such  as  number  of  deaths  or  injured  people;  breakdown  time  and  time  taken  for \nrestoration  of  services;  and  economic  losses  to  railway  assets  during  accidents  as  the  key \nfactors. Discussions with MOR have led to the adoption of technologies for (i) training of staff for \noperation and maintenance;26 and (ii) preventive maintenance and measures to enhance safety \nduring construction, operation, and maintenance.  \n \n40.  Moving from a project-based approach on safety to a sector-wide intervention is a result \nof  sector  dialogue  and  is  a  significant  step  forward.  Agreement  with  MOR  to  rationalize  the \nlocation and reduce the number of the emergency rescue and restoration centers will improve \nrailway efficiency, help reduce staff, and improve staff productivity. The investment support for \nmodern  and  more-efficient  equipment  and  the  capacity  development  program  will  greatly \nimprove  the  capacity  of  rescue,  particularly  from  serious  accidents,  natural  disasters,  and \ncalamities. This will help save peoples\u2019 lives, reduce damage and loss to property, and minimize \nlosses from accidents and emergencies. The response time is expected to reduce significantly \nbecause  of  the  increased  speed,  and  the  restoration  time  is  expected  to  be  reduced  by  50% \nthrough  the  use  of  more  efficient,  higher  capacity,  and  more  versatile  equipment.  This  will \nimprove railway efficiency and enhance railway transportation capacity. The model of financing \ndeveloped  for  the  Project  has  also  encouraged  MOR  to  seek  similar  financing  support  from \nother development partners and financial institutions for railway safety.27 The intervention is well \naligned with the TA support provided for developing the emergency management system in the \nPRC. The Project will bring in new technology, emphasize safety, and build capacity for MOR. \n \nD. \n\nProject Investment Plan \n\n41. \nThe  project  investment  cost  is  estimated  at  the  equivalent  of  $140  million.  Table  1 \nsummarizes the project investment plan and details are in Appendix 9. The cost estimates are \nbased on quantities derived from unit rates, reflecting market prices for goods and materials. \n \n                                                 \n26 ADB recommended MOR to use simulators for hands-on training, trouble-shooting, and checking the response and \nreaction of locomotive drivers and operating staff. MOR has purchased two locomotive simulators, placed them in \ntwo  of  the  training  institutes,  and  is  using  them  for  the  training  of  drivers  and  other  locomotive  operating  staff. \nThese  simulators  are  expected  to  improve  drivers\u2019  operating  skills,  and  help  in  objective  assessment  and \nevaluation of their response and reaction in the event of accidents and emergencies.    \n\n27 Export-Import  Bank  of  the  United  States  has  committed  $200  million  for  the  purchase  of  the  permanent  way \n\nequipment for enhancing safety on tracks in 2007. \n\n\f \n\n13\n\nTable 1: Project Investment Plan  \n($ million) \n\nItem \nA. \n \n \n \n \n \nB. \n \n \nC. \n \n\nBase Costb \n1.

MOR will be the Executing Agency responsible for overall project implementation. MOR \nwill coordinate the project management tasks and be responsible for procurement, withdrawals, \nand  reporting  vis-\u00e0-vis  ADB.  MOR  confirmed  that  the  staff  employed  will  be  experienced  in \nrailway  engineering,  financial,  and  administrative  matters;  and  implementing  projects  financed \nby international financial institutions.  \n \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Period \n\nThe Project will be implemented in about 5 years from January 2008 to December 2012. \n45. \nProcurement  will  start  in  January  2008  and  installation  will  be  completed  in  4  years.  Trial \noperations and final acceptance will be completed by December 2012 (Appendix 10). \n \n\n3. \n\nProcurement \n\n46. \nAll  ADB-financed  procurement  will  follow  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as \namended  from  time  to  time).  ADB  will  finance  procurement  of  materials  and  equipment  as \ndescribed  in  the  procurement  plan  (Appendix  11).  Contracts  valued  equal  or  greater  than \n$1 million  will  be  procured  through  international  competitive  bidding.  Contracts  valued  at  less \nthan $1 million will be procured through international competitive bidding or national competitive \nbidding, in accordance with the PRC Tendering and Bidding Law, 1999, subject to clarifications \nagreed  with  ADB  as  determined  by  the  contract  package.  Below  $100,000,  procurement  will \nfollow the shopping procedure. MOR will select tendering companies on a competitive basis to \nhandle  international  bidding.  The  relevant  sections  of  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as \namended  to  date)  will  be  included  in  all  documents  and  contracts  during  bidding  for,  and \nimplementation of, the Project. \n \n\n4. \n\nConsulting Services \n\nThe  ADB  loan  will  be  used  to  finance  5  person-months  of  consulting  services  to \n47. \nstrengthen  institutional  and  capacity  development  functions  of  the  emergency  management \nsystem in PRC railways. Terms of reference for the consultants\u2014to be recruited using the quality \nand  cost-based  method  (80%  technical  and  20%  financial  weightings)  and  biodata  technical \nproposal, in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended \nfrom  time  to  time)\u2014are  in  Appendix  12.  The  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  will  be \nincluded in all invitation documents and contracts for international consultants.  \n \n\n5. \n\nAnticorruption Policy \n\n \n48. \nADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  was  explained  to,  and  discussed  with,  the  Government. \nConsistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance,  accountability,  and  transparency,  ADB \nreserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, \ncollusive,  or  coercive  practices  relating  to  the  Project.  To  support  these  efforts,  relevant \nprovisions  of  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  are  included  in  the  loan  regulations  and  bidding \ndocuments  for  the  Project.  In  particular,  all  contracts  financed  by  ADB  in  connection  with  the \nProject shall include provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and examine the records and \naccounts of MOR and all contractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service providers as they \nrelate to the Project. \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n15\n\nIn relation to the Project, MOR will ensure that (i) a supervisory body is established for \n49. \nprevention  of  undue  interference  in  business  practices,  and  adequate  resources  are  made \navailable for its effective operation; (ii) a leading group of officials from the supervision division \nof MOR is located in offices involved in the bidding, construction, and other operational activities \nunder  the  Project;  and  (iii)  periodic  inspections  on  the  contractor\u2019s  activities  related  to  fund \nwithdrawals  and  settlements  are  carried  out.  MOR  shall  also  initiate  liaison  meetings  with  the \nprosecutor\u2019s  office,  on  a  needs  basis,  where  any  warnings  about,  or  information  on,  alleged \ncorrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the Project can be discussed. \n \n\n6. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n50. \nThe  ADB  loan  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement \nHandbook (2007, as amended from time to time). Since most payments will be made for large \ncontracts,  direct  payment,  reimbursements,  and  commitment  procedures  will  be  used.  If  the \nGovernment  initially  funds  eligible  expenditures,  ADB\u2019s  reimbursement  procedure  will  be \nfollowed. The statement of expenditures procedure may be used for reimbursement of eligible \nexpenditures  not  exceeding  $100,000  per  individual  payment  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan \nDisbursement Handbook. The payments on excess of statement of expenditures ceiling will be \nreimbursed or liquidated, based on the full supporting documentation process. \n \n\n7. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n51.  MOR  will  maintain  separate  accounts  for  the  Project  and  have  such  accounts  and \nrelated financial statements audited annually by an external auditor in accordance with auditing \nstandards acceptable to ADB. MOR will submit to ADB, within 6 months after the end of each \nfiscal year, certified copies of such audited project accounts and MOR financial statements and \nauditor\u2019s  reports,  all  in  English.  The  audit  of  such  financial  statements  will  include  (i)  an \nassessment of the adequacy of accounting and internal control systems with respect to project \nexpenditures  and  other  financial  transactions,  (ii)  an  assessment  of  compliance  with  loan \ncovenants and ADB requirements for project management, and (iii) an opinion on the use of the \nstatement of expenditures procedure.  \n \n52.  MOR  will  make  satisfactory  arrangements  for  reporting  the  progress  of  project \nimplementation by submitting quarterly progress reports. Within 3 months of completion, MOR \nwill submit a project completion report to ADB. \n \n\n8. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n53.  MOR  agreed  to  a  set  of  indicators  for  evaluating  project  performance  in  relation  to  its \nimpacts, outcomes, outputs, and conditions. The indicators, to be reviewed at the start of project \nimplementation,  include  (i)  railway  transport  indicators  (passenger  and  freight  services), \n(ii) safety  indicators,  and  (iii)  indicators  for  capacity  development.  At  the  beginning  of  project \nimplementation, MOR will establish baseline and target values for the indicators. The indicators \nwill  be  measured  at  project  inception,  completion,  and  3  years  later;  and  compared  with  the \nbaseline  (Appendix  13).  The  main  sources  of  data  include  PRC  railway  statistics  and  reports \nfrom  MOR.  MOR  will  submit  a  report  summarizing  the  key  findings  of  monitoring  at  inception, \ncompletion, and 3 years later to ADB. \n \n\n9. \n\nProject Review \n\n54. \nADB and MOR will carry out review missions annually, including a midterm review in the \nthird  year  after  loan  effectiveness,  covering  all  institutional,  administrative,  organizational, \n\n \n\n\ftechnical, environmental, economic, and other relevant aspects that may have an impact on the \nperformance  of  the  Project.  The  review  will  examine  progress  in  sector  reforms,  policy \ndevelopment, and compliance with covenants in the Loan Agreement. \n \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\n55. \nThe  project  benefits  and  impacts  were  assessed  along  with  potential  risks  associated \nwith  the  Project.  The  combined  benefits  and  impacts  will  outweigh  the  costs,  and net  benefits \nwill accrue to the people and the freight shippers. \n \nA. \n\nEconomic Analysis \n\nThe  economic  internal  rate  of  return  (EIRR)  was  calculated  by  comparing  with-  and \n56. \nwithout- project situations, using constant 2007 economic prices. The Project will introduce new \nand  modern  technology  for  responding  more  quickly  to  emergencies,  taking  less  restoration \ntime, and enhancing safety. Economic costs include costs for emergency rescue and restoration \nequipments,  including  installation  and  commissioning.  Economic  benefits  include  (i)  user  cost \nsavings for freight and passenger traffic; and (ii) time savings for diverted passenger and freight \ntraffic  from  buses,  trucks,  and  other  railway  lines.  The  EIRR  for  the  Project  is  estimated  at \n57.2% (Appendix 14). Sensitivity analysis tested eight scenarios to assess the robustness of the \nresults  of  the  economic  analysis.  The  initial  capital  cost  would  have  to  be  more  than  1,154% \nhigher  than  estimated  for  the  EIRR  to  fall  below  the  cutoff  rate  of  12%.  Considering  the \nexperience  of  ADB-financed  projects  in  the  railway  sector,  this  switching  value  is  unlikely  to \noccur.  The  freight  benefits  would  have  to  decrease  more  than  100%  to  make  the  Project \neconomically  nonviable.  A  1-year  delay  in  completion  does  not  affect  economic  viability. \nCombinations of adverse effects of benefits and costs were also tested. The results showed that \nthe Project would maintain its economic viability under plausible scenarios of variability. \n \nB. \n\nSustainability  \n\n57. \nThe  key  factors  for  the  sustainability  of  the  emergency  system  developed  are \n(i) availability  of  funds  for  operation  and  maintenance,  (ii)  availability  of  spare  parts,  and \nconsumables, and (iii) required skills of the staff that will operate this equipment. The Project is \npart  of  the  Eleventh  FYP  for  railway  development,  approved  by  the  State  Council,  with  clear \ntargets  for  implementation  and  financing  allocation.  MOR  has  confirmed  the  availability  of \ncounterpart  funds  for  the  Project.  The  Project  will  procure  2  years  of  spare  parts  and \nconsumables for the first 2 years\u2019 operation and maintenance with the equipment procurement \nto  sustain  initial  operations.  The  Government  and  MOR  have  committed  to  the  availability  of \nfunds for operation and maintenance of the equipment. Enhancing staff skills is included in the \nproject  design.  These  include  overseas  training,  on-site  training,  and training  in  the  18  rescue \ncenters set up at the railway administration level. Initially, 250 staff will be trained in the handing \nof this equipment.  \n \nC. \n\nEnvironmental Impact and Assessment \n\n58. \nThe Project is classified category C. It will have no adverse environmental impact. The \nequipment  to  be  procured  utilizes  energy  efficient  technologies.  The  environmental  benefits \ninclude  having  the  capacity  to  respond  more  effectively  to  railway  accidents  and  natural \ndisasters, thereby limiting any potential pollution resulting from these causes.  \n \n\n16 \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n17\n\nD. \n\nPoverty Reduction and Social Strategy \n\n59. \nThe aim of a safe and secure transportation system is to avoid events that result in the \nloss  of  or  damage  in  life,  health,  and  property.  It  also enables  the  efficient  flow  of  people  and \ngoods;  protects  the  environment  from  pollution  that  can  result  from  such  events;  and  is  an \nessential component for a healthy population, a high quality of life, and a prosperous economy. \n \n60. \nThe Project will (i) enhance railway safety, enabling railway users to benefit from lower \ntransport costs; (ii) increase the line capacity, benefiting consumers and producers of goods and \nservices through the provision of timely and efficient transport services and lower logistics costs; \n(ii) improve staff productivity, enabling railway users to benefit from lower costs; (iv) improve the \nenvironment  and  reduce  pollution;  and  (v)  reduce  fuel  consumption  and  enhance  energy \nefficiency\u2014 enabling the PRC to save valuable foreign exchange.  \n \n61. \nThe  major  project  beneficiaries  will  be  (i)  the  Government,  which  will  benefit  from \nimproved safety, reduced economic losses, and a reduced energy bill; (ii) passengers, who will \nbenefit  from  affordable,  faster,  and  safer  trips;  and  (iii) freight  shippers,  who  will  benefit  from \nreduced damages to shipments and more affordable, faster, and safer trips.  \n \n62. \nSafe railway transport will benefit all passengers. The poor will benefit equally or more \nfrom the intervention. The links between poverty and accidents are apparent, and the poor are \nat a disadvantage in recovering from the physical and the economic losses suffered because of \ninjuries  or  physical  loss  of  goods.  The  summary  poverty  reduction  and  social  strategy  is  in \nAppendix  15.  The  Project  will  provide  for  an  efficient  and  quicker  restoration  system  that  will \nhelp reduce economic losses.  \n \nE. \n\nRisks  \n\nThe Project is formulated to minimize potential risks. Based on experience with previous \n63. \nrailway  projects,  traffic  demand  is  estimated  conservatively.  Sensitivity  tests  indicate  that \neconomic  circumstances  would  have  to  become  substantially  adverse  for  the  Project  to  lose \neconomic viability. Other potential risks for the Project during implementation could be financing, \ntechnology, interoperability, and procurement. These risks have been assessed and mitigating \nmeasures  have  been  provided  based  on  lessons  from  other  railroad  projects  in  the  PRC. \nInadequate  staff  skills  are  also  a  risk  to  the  Project.  The  project  design  includes  a  capacity \ndevelopment program to enhance staff skills, as they are critical to the success of the Project. \n \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nSpecific  Assurances.  In  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has \n\n64. \ngiven the following assurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents. \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nReform  measures.  The  Government  will  continue  to  implement  the  Eleventh \nFYP for railway development. \nEquipment  quality.  The  Government  will  cause  MOR  to  ensure  that  the \nemergency  rescue  and  restoration  equipment \nin \naccordance  with  the  Government\u2019s  national  technical  standards,  and  that \nsupervision,  quality  control,  and  contract  management  are  carried  out  in  a \nperiodic and satisfactory manner.  \n\nis  procured  and  used \n\n \n\n \n\n\f(iii) \n\n \n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nAssociated  facilities.  The  Government  will  cause  MOR  to  ensure  that \nnecessary associated facilities required for the operation of the project equipment \nare completed in a timely manner. \n\nSupply  of  rolling  stock. The Government will cause MOR to provide sufficient \nrolling stock at all times for effective operation of the project equipment. \n\nSustainability.  The  Government  will  cause  MOR  to  ensure  (a)  adequate \ncounterpart  funding,  staffing,  and  institutional  support  for  implementation  of  the \nProject;  (b)  that  necessary  measures  are  taken  promptly  to  resolve  any  issues \nidentified  during  operation  of  the  project  equipment;  and  (c)  appropriate \nbudgetary allocations are made for the continued operation and maintenance of \nthe project equipment. \n\nAnticorruption.  In  addition  to  ensuring  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption \nPolicy,  the  Government  will  ensure,  and  cause  MOR  to  ensure,  that  (a)  a \nsupervisory body is established for prevention of undue interference in business \npractices, and adequate resources are made available for its effective operation; \n(b) a leading group of officials from the supervision division of MOR is located in \noffices  involved  in  operational  activities  under  the  Project;  and  (c)  periodic \ninspections  on  the  contractor\u2019s  activities  related  to  fund  withdrawals  and \nsettlements  are  carried  out.  The  Government  will  also  cause  MOR  to  initiate \nliaison  meetings  with  the  prosecutor\u2019s  office,  on  a  needs  basis,  where  any \nwarnings  about,  or  information  on,  alleged  corrupt,  fraudulent,  collusive,  or \ncoercive practices relating to the Project can be discussed. \n\nVI. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\nI am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \n65. \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  of \n$100,000,000  to  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  for  the  Railway  Safety  Enhancement  Project \nfrom ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, with interest to be determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nLondon  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility;  a  term  of  25  years,  including  a \ngrace period of 5 years; and such other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance \nwith those set forth in the draft Loan Agreement presented to the Board. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n16 November 2007 \n \n\nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n18 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n\nData Sources/Reporting \nMechanisms \n\n \nPRC railway statistics \nbefore and after the \nProject \n \nProject performance \nmanagement system at \ninception, completion, and \n3 years after \n \nProject completion report \n \n\n \nMOR statistics  \n \nProgress reports  \n \nProject administration \nmissions and project \ncompletion report \n \nAnnual reports from MOR \n \n \n \nProgress reports  \n \n \n \nProject administration \nmissions and project \ncompletion report \n \n\nProject administration \nmissions, progress \nreports, and PCR \n\nProgress reports \n \nProject administration \nmissions and project \ncompletion report \n \n \nConsultant\u2019s reports \n \n\nPerformance Targets/ \nIndicators \n\n \nPassenger traffic increases from \n666 billion passenger-km in 2006 to \n950 billion passenger-km in 2012 \n \nFreight traffic increases from \n2,172 billion ton-km in 2006 to \n3,000 billion ton-km in 2012 \n \n20% improvement in the rate of \naccidents per billion traffic units by \n2012, over 2006 \n \nOperating ratio is less than 1 in 2012 \n \n \n136 emergency rescue and restoration \ncenters are set up by December 2012 \n \nRescue time for accident and \nemergencies is reduced by 50% by \nDecember 2012  \n \nRestoration time for accident and \nemergencies is reduced by 50% by \nDecember 2012 \n\n \nEmergency rescue and restoration \nequipment is procured, installed, and \nput into operation by 2012 \n \n2-year spare parts and consumables \nrequired for 2 years of operation \nemergency rescue and restoration \nequipment are available by 2012  \n \nThe number of emergency rescue and \nrestoration centers is rationalized and \nreduced from 175 to 136 by 2012 \n \n18 comprehensive rescue training \ncenters, complete with training \nfacilities, are set up in the railway \nadministration by 2012 \n \nAn effective training and skill \nenhancement program is developed;   \n250 staff are trained on safety \nmaintenance equipment by 2012 \n \n5 person-months of international \nconsulting services are provided for \ncapacity development and institutional \nstrengthening by 2012 \n \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n19\n\nAssumptions \nand Risks \n\nAssumption \n\u2022  Government investment \n\nis implemented as \nplanned \n\nAssumptions \n\u2022  MOR gives high priority \n\nto establishment of safety \ncenters \n\n \n\u2022  Institutional changes are \ncarried out as proposed \n\n \n\nAssumptions \n\u2022  Emergency rescue and \nrestoration equipment is \nprocured as planned \n\n \n\u2022  Adequate counterpart \nfunds are provided \n\n \n \n \n\u2022  Approval will be given in \n\na timely manner \n\n \n \n\u2022  Adequate counterpart \nfunds are provided \n\n \n\u2022  Trained staff is deployed \n\nin their areas of \nexpertise, and apply their \nknowledge to daily work  \n\n \nRisk \n\u2022  Adequate funds are not \n\ninvested in training \n\nDesign \nSummary \nImpact \nAn efficient, safe, \nreliable, competitive \nrailway transport \nsystem that contributes \nto the PRC\u2019s social \ndevelopment is \ndeveloped in the PRC \n\nOutcome \nAn efficient and \neffective emergency \nmanagement system is \ndeveloped \n\nOutputs \n1.

\n\n23 \n\nRAILWAY SECTOR ANALYSIS \n\nRailway Sector Profile \n\nthe  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC) \n\nthat  constrain  efficient  economic  development, \n\n \nA. \n \nKey  Features.  Despite  government  efforts  to  increase  the  country's  transport  capacity, \n1. \nserious constraints and bottlenecks remain, especially in the road and railway sectors. By the end \nof  2005, \ntransport  system  comprised  about \n75,438 kilometers (km) of railways, 1.86 million km of highways, 123,300 km of inland waterways, \nand  2.05  million km  of  civil  aviation  routes.  However,  the  density  of  the  transport  network  ranks \namong the lowest in the world relative to either population or geographic area. From 1978, when \neconomic reforms were first introduced, through to 2006, the PRC experienced sustained rapid \neconomic  growth.  This  resulted  in  a  rapid  increase  in  demand  for  transportation.  The  annual \ngrowth  of  passenger  transport  was  7.6%  and  freight  transport  9.0%  during  1978\u20132006. \nRailways  are  the  principal  mode  of  freight  transport  in  the  PRC.  In  2006,  the  modal  split  for \nfreight  ton-km  was  47.5%  for  railways  followed  by  27.9%  for  inland  waterways  and  sea-shore \nshipping,  21.1%  for  roads,  3.3%  for  pipelines,  and  0.2%  for  civil  aviation.  In  2006,  road  traffic \naccounted for 52.8% of total passenger-km, followed by railways with 34.5%, civil aviation with \n12.3%, and coastal and inland waterways with 0.4%.  \n \n2. \nRecent  Developments.  To  improve  transport  inefficiencies  and  eliminate  transport \nincreased \nbottlenecks \ninvestment  in  transport  infrastructure  in  the  Tenth  Five-Year  Plan  (FYP),  2006\u20132010,  and  the \nEleventh  FYP,  2006\u20132010.  Investment  in  transport  infrastructure  as  a  share  of  gross  domestic \nproduct (GDP) more than doubled in the last decade. By the end of 2005, a total investment of \nCNY308 billion  for  capital  construction  was  made  for  constructing  6,458  km  of  new  lines, \nproviding  3,725  km  of  double  lines  and  electrifying  6,259  km  of  tracks.  A  World  Bank  study1 \nindicates  that  total  transport  investment  should  be  increased  to  at  least  3.8%  of  GDP  to  avoid \neconomic costs associated with transport constraints. To meet the increase in transport demand, \nmore infrastructure investments are needed. The Government continues to accord high priority to \ntransport.  \n \n3. \nFuture Development Priorities and Outlook. The Eleventh FYP envisages substantial \ninvestments  in  the  road  and  railway  sectors  from  both  domestic  and  international  financing \nsources, including the private sector. It continues to emphasize railway development, and seeks \nto  speed  up  railway  construction.  The  plan  envisages  (i) constructing 17,000  km of  new  lines, \nand (ii) that 45% of the network length will be double-track and electrified. It seeks to (i) build a \ndedicated  passenger  railway  network  through  the  construction  of  7,000  km  of  passenger \ndedicated  lines  by  2010;  (ii)  develop  coal  transport  corridors  by  increasing  capacity  of  the \nexisting lines; (iii) expand the railway network in the poor western region (to reach 34,000 km); \n(iv) build international corridors at the borders in the southwest and northwest; and (v) develop a \ncountrywide  intermodal  container  network.  A  total  investment  of  CNY1.5  trillion  or  about \n$190 billion  (CNY1.25  trillion  for  construction  and  CNY250  billion  for  rolling  stock)  is  planned \nover the next 5-year period (Table A4). \n \nIn 2004, the State Council approved the new railway development plan (up to 2020). The \n4. \nplan seeks to expand the railway network from 74,000 km in 2004 to 85,000 km by 2010, and to \n\nthe  Government \n\n                                                 \n1  East  Asia  and  Pacific  Regional  Office.

Washington, DC.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\f24 \n\nAppendix 4 \n\n100,000 km by 2020. Increasing train speed is a major goal.2 Priority will be given to developing \nrailways in unserved areas, and regions that lack transport and have remained less developed. \nThe  route  network  length  will  be  increased  by  16,000 km  to  reach  40,000  km  in  the  western \nregion of the PRC by 2020. The plan calls for separating passenger and freight traffic in heavily \ntrafficked corridors, and 12,000 km of passenger dedicated corridor will be developed by 2020. \nThe plan also seeks to ensure a high level of safety performance in infrastructure construction \nand construction services by (i) strictly adhering to safety regulations, (ii) strengthening transport \nsafety by using modern and better quality equipment, (iii) proper training of staff, (iv) improving \nstaff  education  and  technical  skills,  (v)  strengthening  the  responsibility  and  accountability  for \nsafety in railway transportation, and (vi) comprehensive management of public security. \n \n5. \nOther  Development  Partner  Operations. In the railway subsector, the Japan Bank for \nInternational Cooperation and the World Bank, in addition to the Asian Development Bank (ADB), \nhave been mainly involved in expanding the capacity of national railways. In the past 20 years, the \nJapan  Bank  for  International  Cooperation  has  provided  \u00a5578 billion  for  15  railway  projects  to \nexpand  rail  transport  capacity,  particularly  in  major  coal  transport  corridors.  It  has  also  financed \ndevelopment of new sections of the national railway network in inland provinces. Since 1984, the \nWorld  Bank  has  provided  11  loans  totaling  $2.6 billion  for  10  national  railway  projects  and  one \nlocal railway project. ADB introduced the French Development Agency in the PRC railway sector \nin  2004,3 and  has  since  financed  two  railway  projects.  In  recent  years,  German  development \ncooperation through Kreditanstalt f\u00fcr Wiederaufbau has also provided assistance to the Ministry \nof Railways (MOR) for financing three railway projects.  \n \nB. \n \n6. \nAssistance  in  the  Sector.  ADB  has  focused  on  improving  infrastructure  in  less \ndeveloped and poor regions to promote sustainable economic growth and reduce poverty. Since \n1989, ADB has provided 14 loans totaling about $2.9 billion to help finance the construction of \n1,921 km  of  new  railway  lines  under  eight  local  railway  projects,  and  5,541 km  of  new  railway \nlines  under  six  national  railway  projects.  These  projects  have  introduced  modern  technology \nand  improved  the  efficiency  of  railway  operation  through  institutional  and  structural  reforms. \nADB  also  provided  12  technical  assistance  initiatives  totaling  about  $5.6 million  to  promote  the \ncommercial  operation  of  railways,  establish  corporate  governance,  achieve  cost  recovery,  and \nimprove railway management.  \n \nEvaluation of Assistance. The evaluation4 of ADB assistance for the transport sector in \n7. \nthe  PRC  assessed  ADB  program\u2019s  for  railways  \u201csuccessful\u201d.  The  evaluation  noted  that,  in  the \nrailway subsector, ADB strategic priorities were well aligned with PRC needs. Its overall focus of \nbuilding railways using modern technologies addressed needs to increase railway capacity and \nreduce  the  persistent  gap  between  demand  and  supply  as  quickly  and  efficiently  as  possible. \nADB\u2019s  priority  of  improving  efficiency  and  commercial  orientation,  and  its  emphasis  on \nrestructuring and reforming policy, was well matched to evolving institutional reforms in railways.  \n \n8. \nExperience  from  completed  and  ongoing  ADB-financed  railway  projects  in  the  PRC \nshows  strong  commitment  and  generally  satisfactory  capabilities  of  the  executing  agencies \n\nAsian Development Bank Experience \n\n                                                 \n2  In April 2007, train speed was increased to over 160 km/hour (h) on 14,000 km and 200\u2013250 km/h on 6,000 km of \n\nrailway lines. \n\n3  AFD cofinanced ($40 million) ADB. 2004.

The EAs generally complied with the loan covenants. Resettlement and \nenvironmental  management  were  carried  out  satisfactorily.  Audited  financial  statements  were \nsubmitted  in  a  timely  manner,  and  the  audited  financial  statements  were  found  generally \nacceptable.  Of  ADB\u2019s  14  railway  projects,  eight  are  complete,  two  started  trial  operation,  and \nfour  are  under  implementation.  The  key  lessons  highlight  the  need  to  (i) ensure  that  the  EA \nestablished  for  project  processing  and  implementation  has  adequate  capacity;  (ii) prepare \nrealistic traffic forecasts; (iii) review constraints to traffic on a network basis, and the impact on \nproject viability of the existing and/or planned railway lines and other transportation modes that \nmay  compete  with  the  project  facilities;  and  (iv) finance  railway  projects  with  appropriately \ndetermined  debt-equity  ratios.  The  railway  projects  have  contributed \nto  a  dramatic \ntransformation  of  local  economies.  Per  capita  rural  incomes  in  project  areas  increased \nsubstantially. Living standards were raised and poverty reduced. The project performance audit \nreport5 for the ADB-financed Jing\u2013Jiu railway project in the PRC concluded that the project was \n\u201csuccessful\u201d and exceeded its original passenger traffic forecasts. \n \nC. \n \n9. \nStrategy  and  Priorities.  ADB\u2019s  strategy  for  the  railway  sector  has  three  broad \nobjectives:  (i) improve  economic  efficiency,  (ii) promote  growth  in  poor  inland  provinces  to \nreduce  poverty,  and  (iii) protect  the  environment  and  manage  natural  resources.  In  pursuit  of \nthese  three  objectives,  the  strategy  supports  developing  efficient  and  integrated  transport \nnetworks to meet the needs of a growing market economy and to contribute to reducing poverty \nthrough  investment  targeting  poorer  areas,  coupled  with  policy  and  institutional  reforms. \nBecause  of  the  importance  of  railway  transport  for  the  development  of  the  national  economy, \nADB\u2019s  strategy  for  the  railway  sector  focuses  on  (i) expanding  the  railway  system  by \nconstructing  new  lines  in  unserved  areas  that  are  less  developed  and  poor;  (ii) modernizing \nrailways,  enhancing  safety,  and  increasing  the  capacity  to  improve  transport  efficiency  on  key \nroutes of the national railway system; (iii) commercializing railway operations to sustain efficient \noperations;  (iv)  promoting  energy  conservation  and  environmental  sustainability;  and \n(v) increasing railway competitiveness in the transport system through restructuring and reform.  \n \nPoverty  Reduction.  ADB  focuses  on  four  issues  to  enhance  the  poverty  reduction \n10. \nimpacts of transport investments: (i) locating ADB-financed projects in less developed and poor \nregions where new lines will stimulate economic development, (ii) encouraging maximization of \nemployment  of  poor  people  during  project  construction  and  operation,  (iii) supplying  local \nmaterials  that  meet  the  requirements  of  quality  and  economy  from  poor  villages,  and \n(iv) providing station access roads and link roads to widen project benefits to poor interior areas. \n \n11. \nGovernance and Policy Reform Agenda. The ADB policy reform agenda in the railway \nrestructuring  MOR,  commercializing  operations,  supporting \nsector \nis  contributing \nmanagement  autonomy  of  railway  operations,  developing  human  resources,  and  improving \nfinancial management and accounting systems. \n \nPromoting Private Sector Development. The PRC\u2019s large infrastructure needs require \n12. \nlocal  governments  to  shift  from  traditional  financing  modes  to  capital  markets.  In  the  railway \nsector,  a  wider  role  for  the  private  sector  is  envisaged.  ADB\u2019s  policy  dialogue  encourages \nincreased private sector participation in the railway sector. ADB is assisting MOR with a study to \n\nto \n\n                                                 \n5  ADB.  2002.

Possible  areas  for \nprivate  participation  include  container  transportation,  setting  up  inland  container  depots, \nindustrial sidings, commercial services, tourism, parcel-related businesses, and equity stake in \nprojects. MOR has taken steps to create the conditions necessary to attract investments in the \nproject  facilities  and  services  from  nongovernment  and  private  sector  sources.  In  2005  and \n2006, the State Council and MOR issued guidelines on facilitating the investment and financing \nsystem reforms, which seek to reduce the threshold of the investment, encourage private sector \nto invest, and welcome strategic investors in railway financing.6 Strategic and private investors7 \nare participating in the project equity of the ADB-financed Taiyuan\u2013Zhongwei Railway Project.8 \nIn  2006,  an  initial  public  offering  for  Daqin  railway  company  (CNY15  billion)  was made,  which \nwas heavily oversubscribed. \n \n13. \nRegional  Cooperation.  The  PRC  is  an  active  participant  in  three  regional  cooperation \ninitiatives:  (i) through  Yunnan  and  Guangxi  province  for  the  Greater  Mekong  Subregion, \n(ii) through  the  Xinjiang  Autonomous  Region  for  the  Central  Asian  republics  initiative,  and \n(iii) through  Inner  Mongolia  with  Mongolia.  Improvement  of  cross-border  trade  regimes  is  a \ncommon feature of these initiatives. Since these programs involve the poorer areas of the PRC, \nexpanding  regional  markets  and  options  could  help  reduce  poverty.  The  Greater  Mekong \nSubregion  and  Central  Asia  Regional  and  Economic  Cooperation  programs  are  developing \nstrategies for transport cooperation, of which railway is an important subsector. Steps are being \ntaken to develop an institutional framework to facilitate the implementation of regional transport \nprojects,  e.g.,  Uzbekistan\u2013Kyrgyz  Republic\u2013PRC  railway  development  and  the  Pan-Asian \nrailway project (Singapore\u2013Kunming railway link project). \n \nD. \n \n14.  Monitoring  Targets,  Indicators,  Modality,  and  Processes.  The Government monitors \nand evaluates sector performance annually; these are reviewed by ADB through the process of \nthe  country  partnership  strategy.  Indicators  for  evaluating  sector  performance  include \n(i) economic development and poverty indicators for the western region; (ii) transport density in \nrelation to land area and population; (iii) public and private investment in railways; (iv) transport \ndemand  for  freight  and  passengers  with  modal  split  data;  (v) level  of  user  charges  (railway \nconstruction  surcharges,  etc.);  and  (vi) cross-border  traffic  volumes  with  the  Central  Asian \nrepublics, Greater Mekong Subregion, and Mongolia. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nPerformance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n                                                 \n6  China National Oil Petroleum Company is financing CNY1.7 billion for Beijing\u2013Tianjin intercity railway line, whose \n\nconstruction started in July 2005 and is expected to be completed by August 2006. \n\n7  China  Communication  Construction  Engineering  Group,  Beijing;  China  Engineering  Construction  Group,  Beijing; \n\nand Shaanxi Province Hualong Energy Limited Liability Company, Xi\u2019an. \n\n8  ADB.  2006.

The  People\u2019s \nRepublic of China (PRC), a country with diverse geology and challenging environment, has two \nthirds of its areas threatened by floods; nearly half of the cities located in the seismic belt; more \nmountainous area than plain areas; great elevation differences between east and west; frequent \ngeological  disasters  such  as  landslides  and  flow  of  debris;  frequent  typhoons  in  the  southern \npart; frequent sandstorms and windstorms in the western part; and snowstorms in the northern \npart.  PRC  railways  crisscross  the  length  and  breadth  of  the  country,  and  this  working \nenvironment makes managing safety on the PRC railways a technical and human challenge.  \n \nThe  Government  and  Ministry  of  Railways  (MOR)  attach  great  importance  to  rail \n2. \ntransport  safety,  and  it  is  an  important  cornerstone  of  the  PRC  railway  development  strategy. \nSafety is an inherent element underlying all planned modernization and technological upgrading \non  PRC  railways.  It  is  supported  through  various  development  plans,  such  as  the  Five-Year \nPlans,  Annual  Development  Plans,  and  Long Term  Railway  Network  Development  Plan  2020, \nwhich include strategy and investments in the important area of railway safety.  \n \nThe  Long-Term  Railway  Network  Development  Plan  to  2020  (2020  Plan),1 which  lays \n3. \ndown an ambitious blueprint of railway network development until 2020, envisages that safety of \nrail transport services shall be ensured by (i) strictly adhering to safety regulations, (ii) improving \nstaff education and technical skills through training, (iii) upgrading technology and modernizing \nequipment  for  railway  operation  and  safety,  and  (iv)  strengthening  responsibility  and \naccountability for safety in railway transport. \n \n4. \nThe  2020  Plan  also  envisages  that  information  technology  and  computerization  will \ncover  all  facets  of  railway  operation  and  management\u2014particularly  transport  safety  and \noperations\u2014because of the typical characteristics of the railway system. It also recognizes that \nexpansion of the railway network and technological upgrading have not been accompanied by \ninvestments and development in human resources, and seeks to provide impetus by increased \ninvestment support. MOR has adopted a proactive strategy for safety management and adopted \ninitiatives that cover technology, equipment, and human resource development through training \nand education under the 11th Five-Year Plan.  \n \n5. \nPRC  railways  have  a  well  established  three-level  organizational  structure  (ministry, \nrailway administration, and station) for the management of safety on the railways (Figure A5.1).  \n \n6. \nWithin  MOR,  the  supervision  of  safety  is  the  responsibility  of  the  Safety  Supervision \nBureau  (SSB),  which  has  three  divisions.  SSB  is  headed  by  a  director  general,  and  has  the \nfollowing responsibilities: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nsupervise  the  execution  by  railway  administrations  and  related  departments  of \nthe directions, policies, laws, regulations, and instructions on safety of production \nissued by the state; \nsupervise  the  implementation  of  regulations,  acts  and  measures  relating  to \noperational safety, non-railway personnel safety and accident treatment; \nsupervise  maintenance  and  repair,  and  periodical  repair  of  all  train  operation \nequipment; \n\n                                                 \n1  The 2020 Plan was approved by the State Council in January 2004. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 5 \n\n29 \n\n(v) \n\n(iv)  monitor  and  check  the  training,  education,  and  examination  of  staff  directly \ninvolved in train operation; urge the relevant department and unit to take effective \nmeasures to improve the quality of operation staff; \nassist  in  the  preparation  and  modification  of  Railway  Technical  Management \nRegulations  and  other  codes,  regulations,  instructions,  and  the  train  working \ndiagram; \nprepare  regulations  for  treatment  of  railway  operation  accident  and  train \noperational safety supervision work; and \norganize  the  relevant  railway  entities  to  carry  out  investigation  and  treatment  of \nvery large train operation accident and large accidents of a serious nature; and to \nreview  and  propose  follow-up  measures  in  the  case  of  very  large  or  large \naccidents that are controversial or those that are not properly treated. \n\n(vii) \n\n(vi) \n\nThe three divisions of SSB have the following functions: \n\n7. \n \n\nGeneral  Division:  (a)  general  administration  of  SSB;  (b)  carry  out  analysis  of \naccidents on all railways, including the national railway, joint venture railway, and \nlocal railways; and (c) any other matter not covered by the other two divisions. \n\nOperation  Safety  Division:  (a)  carry  out  investigation,  determine  cause(s)  and \nresponsibility for operational accidents; (b) arrange and oversee training of staff \nin  areas  of  operation  safety;  and  (c)  oversee  preventive  actions  to  be  taken  by \nrailway  administrations  based  on  the  recommendations  made  in  accident \ninvestigations.  \n\nLabor Safety Division: (a) supervise the operational departments and entities of \nPRC  railways  with  regard  to  their  implementation  of  national  policies,  laws, \nregulations,  and  instructions  on  safety;  (b)  supervise  the  performance  of  staff \nresponsible for  operational  safety;  (c)  supervise  labor  and operational discipline \nrelevant for operational safety; (d) organize investigations and determine cause(s) \nin  the  case  of  extra  large  accidents  and  any  other  fatal  accident  that  is \nconsidered important, as a special case; and (e) carry out analysis of accidents \ninvolving staff. \n\n8. \nThe staff of SSB has expertise in railway operation and safety, including the disciplines of \ntransportation,  locomotive,  rolling  stock,  permanent  way,  and  signaling  and  communications. \nStaff from any of the three divisions may be specially appointed inspector of safety supervision \nfor participation in investigations of accidents in accordance with the regulations for safety and \naccident treatment.  \n \n\n \n\n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\f30 \n\nAppendix 5 \n\nDirector General \n\nRailway Administration  \n\nDeputy Director-\nGeneral \n\nGeneral Division \n(Chief [1], \nMembers [2]) \n\nFigure A5.1: Safety Organization for Ministry of Railways \n\nLabor Safety \nDivision (Chief [1],  \nMembers [2]) \n\nMinistry of \nRailways \nSafety \nSupervision \nBureau \n\nOperation Safety \nDivision (Chief [1], \nDeputy Chief [2], \nMembers [4]) \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n9. \nThe second level of safety management is at the railway administration level. Within the \nrailway  administration,  a  safety  supervision  office  is  responsible  for  monitoring  safety  in  the \njurisdiction  of  the  railway  administration.  The  safety  supervision  office  has  a  dual  reporting \nfunction\u2014it  reports  to  the  director  general  of  the  RA  and  submits  direct  reports  to  SSB. \nFollowing  the  dissolution  of  41  sub-railway  administrations  in  April  2005  as  part  of  the \norganizational  reform,  the  safety  supervision  offices  in  the  former  sub-railway  administration \nhave  been  reorganized  into  safety  supervision  branch  offices  to  monitor  the  safety  functions. \nStrengthening  of  the  safety  supervision  branch  offices  was  done  by  assigning  additional  staff \n\nSafety Supervision Branch \nOffice (one or three offices \nunder each Railway \nAdministration) \n\nRemaining 17 Railway \nAdministrations  \nhave similar setup \n\nRailway Administration Safety \nSupervision Office\n\nSafety Section at every \nStation and Depot  \n\nSource: Consultant based on Ministry of Railways Regulations. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 5 \n\n31 \n\nfrom those rendered surplus in the former sub-railway administrations.2 The safety supervision \nbranch offices monitor and supervise the safety functions of railway operation staff in the field \nunits (i.e., stations and depots).  \n \nThe  third  level  of  safety  management  is  the  field  level,  where  every  station  and  depot \n10. \nhas a safety section for monitoring and supervising railway operation safety functions in the field \nunit.  \n \nEvery year, MOR organizes a National Safety Work Meeting that reviews the work done \n11. \nin the field of safety in the past year and prepares a program of work to be done in the future for \nenhancing  safety.  MOR  also  conducts  urgent  inspections  of  railways  and  related  facilities  to \nensure  safe  transportation;3 and  regularly  issues  directions  to  the  railway  administrations  and \nstations  for  safety  drills,  inspections,  and  undertaking  special  preventive  measures  to  avoid \naccidents.  \n \n12. \nThe structure for implementing and monitoring safety of railway operations has worked \nwell.  Continual  improvement  in  railway  operational  safety  is  evidenced  by  the  continuous \ndeclining trend in all accident statistics (Table A5). This is indicative of the efficacy of the safety \norganization.  Following  the  dissolution  of  the  sub-railway  administrations,  the  strengthening  of \nthe safety function in the newly constituted safety supervision branch offices was a step in the \nright direction.  \n \n\nTable A5: Accident Statistics of Railways in the People\u2019s Republic of China \n\nNumber of Accidents \n\nAccident Losses \n\nYear \n\n1990 \n1995 \n2000 \n2005 \n\nTotal \n\n4,126 \n3,010 \n827 \n1,142 \n\nExtra Large, \nVery Large, \nand Large \n64 \n19 \n19 \n11 \n\nAsset in \nCNY million \n\nLoss of life \n\nGrievous \nInjuries \n\n40.00 \n31.58 \n44.15 \n34.07 \n\n166 \n91 \n65 \n39 \n\n317 \n176 \n106 \n59 \n\nSource: Consultant based on information from Ministry of Railways. \n\n \n13.  With respect to the handling of accidents, a detailed procedure has been laid down for \nreporting  railway  accidents  and  incidents  to  various  levels  of  management  within  the \nGovernment and MOR. The procedure4 stipulates that the occurrence of an extra large accident \nis  to  be  reported  to  the  State  Council  within  24  hours  of  its  occurrence.  Within  MOR,  the \nGeneral  Division  of  SSB  is  responsible  for  collating  statistics  and  preparing  analysis  of  all \naccidents  on  the  national,  joint  ventures,  and  local  railways  in  the  PRC.  The  regulations5 lay \ndown  in  detail  the  procedure  and  responsibilities  for  reporting  accidents,  and  require  swift \nmeasures  to  be  taken  for  rescue  and  relief  after  the  occurrence  of  an  accident  to  minimize \nlosses.  \n \n\n                                                 \n2  About 90% of the sub-railway administration staff was declared redundant. \n3  In  the  summer  of  2000,  there  was  a  nationwide  push  for  transportation  safety  after  several  serious  accidents \nresulted  in  loss  of  life.  MOR  issued  directions  to  the  railway  administrations  and  stations  to  check  rail  conditions \nwithin  their  areas  carefully,  including  fire-and-flood  control  measures  along  railways;  and  strict  regulation  of \nconstruction sites and on-the-job safety. MOR issued instructions to stop any overloading of freight and passenger \ntrains and to severely punish those responsible. \n\n4  State Council regulation no. 34, issued in 2000 for extra large accidents and MOR3 (2000) for all other accidents. \n5  MOR Regulation No. 3, 1 July 2000. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f32 \n\nAppendix 5 \n\nThe  organizational  arrangement  for  accident  rescue  and  relief  is  well  established \n14. \n(bottom-up  approach)  and  is  detailed  in  Figure  A5.2.  It  starts  from  the  first  information  report \nfrom the field and works upward to the railway administration and then to MOR.  \n\n \n \nFigure A5.2: Flow Chart of Rescue and Relief after Accident \n\nTrain Operation Guard (or driver) \n\nTrain Controller in Railway \nAdministration\n\nControl Section Chief on duty in \nRailway Administration \n\nIf necessary, immediately rush rescue train to the site of accident and inform the following \nto proceed immediately to the site \n\nDirector \nof rescue \ntrain and \nrescue \ntrain term \nleader \n\nDirector \ngeneral of \nrailway \nadministration \nand relevant \ndeputy director \ngeneral \n\nDirector \ngeneral of \nRailway \nPublic \nSecurity \nDepartment \n\nDirector of \nSafety \nRegulation \nOffice of railway \nadministration \nand division \nchiefs of \nrelevant \ndivisions\n\nRelevant stationmasters and \nchiefs of such units as \noperation organization, \npassenger traffic, locomotive \nmaintenance, way \nmaintenance, signaling and \ncommunications, power supply, \nwater supply, and logistics, as \nwell as relevant medical staff\n\nSource: Consultant based on Ministry of Railways Regulations. \n\n \n \nThe  regulations  issued  by  the  State  Council  and  MOR  detail  the  procedure  for \n15. \ninvestigation of accidents. In the event of an extra large accident, the provincial government or \nthe  relevant  department  in  charge  of  the  State  Council  (i.e.,  MOR)  should  organize  an \ninvestigation  of  the  accident.  In  such  cases,  MOR  participates  by  specially  appointing  an \ninspector  of  safety  supervision  (from  SSB)  to  participate  in  the  accident  investigation  group, \nwhich  includes  members  from  provincial  government,  public  security,  and  other  relevant \ndepartments. The investigation of accidents other than extra large is carried out by the railway \nadministrations.6  \n\n                                                 \n6  MOR  may  specifically  appoint  an  inspector  of  safety  supervision  to  investigate  an  accident  if  it  is  considered \n\nnecessary, based on the importance of the accident. However, such an exception is rarely made. \n\n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 6 \n\n33 \n\nEXTERNAL ASSISTANCE TO THE RAILWAY SECTOR \nPeriod \n1980\u20131983 \n1980\u20131983 \n1980 \n1984\u20131987 \n1984\u20131988 \n1988\u20131989 \n1988\u20131989 \n1991\u20131993 \n1991\u20131993 \n1991\u20131993 \n1991\u20131994 \n1993 \n1991\u20131994 \n1996\u20131997 \n1996\u20131997 \n1996\u20131997 \n\nA.

However, since post-\nevaluation, the operating performance has improved \nsubstantially because of new management and some \nphysical improvements.  \nPart 1 of the TA assisted the EA with construction \nmanagement. Part 2 helped address the areas of concern \nfor improving operation. However, this assistance was not \nsufficient to overcome problems associated with this \nproject. \n\nThe PCR concluded that the project was \u201csuccessful\u201d.b \nTraffic exceeded forecasts and commercial operations \nwere successful. There was rapid economic growth and \nsubstantial social changes in the project area after project \ncompletion. Jobs created in tertiary industry helped \nwomen improve their social status. The EA was \nrestructured into a joint-stock company. An important \nlesson was to ensure appropriate capital adequacy for \nsuch projects, as 100% debt financing is not financially \nsustainable. \nThe TA supported the establishment of a market-oriented \nand profit-conscious management. The organizational \nstructure was rationalized, corporate profitability \nobjectives established, and associated management \npolicies implemented. Computerization aided \nmanagement and financial decision making. \nThe TA helped identify railway projects for development \nof unserved areas. Some have been built. \n\nThe PCR rated the project \u201csuccessful\u201d.c Commercial \noperation started 1 year ahead of schedule. Traffic and \nrevenues exceeded forecasts. The railway had a \nsubstantial socioeconomic impact.d Incomes and living \nstandards in the project area were raised and poverty \nreduced after project completion. Employment creation in \nthe service industry increased opportunities for women. \nDebt-servicing problems resulting from 100% debt \nfinancing were addressed by financial restructuring. \nBased on the successful financial performance, the \nGuang\u2013Mei\u2013Shan Railway Company raised $510 million \nthrough an initial public offering on the New York Stock \nExchange in 1996.  \nFinance and marketing functions were strengthened, and \ncomputer applications developed to improve management \ninformation systems. The TA helped establish the EA as a \ncommercial entity, focusing on corporate and \norganizational reform, commercial operation, and \neffective information flow.

The lessons learned were: \n(i) undercapitalization led to high, short-term debt \nfinancing; (ii) traffic forecasts need to be prepared \nconsidering alternative routes; and (iii) tariffs should \nconsider those on alternative railways. Since 2003, the \ntraffic has increased substantially.  \nThe TA helped the railway company improve commercial \norientation and knowledge of market-oriented businesses. \nThe railway company was assisted in forecasting financial \nperformance during 1999\u20132003. The EA was helped in \nassessing the year 2000 readiness of the project facilities \nand taking remedial measures. \n \n\nThe PCR and PPAR concluded that the project was \n\u201csuccessful\u201d.f MOR acquired modern technology and \nimplemented organizational and tariff reforms that \nimproved efficiency. The project helped stimulate \neconomic growth in the project area, particularly in the \npoverty counties in Jiangxi province. Per capita income \nincreased substantially and poverty incidence fell. This \nproject also highlighted the need to forecast freight traffic \nmore accurately than it did. \nThe TA concluded that (i) a separate entity for \ncommercial operation of the Jing\u2013Jiu Railway is not \ndesirable, as it would place the Jing\u2013Jiu Railway at a \ncompetitive disadvantage; and (ii) the operation should be \nintegrated with the national network. The proposal for a \nhigher tariff for the north\u2013south corridor, including the \nJing\u2013Jiu Railway, was put into effect.  \nThe PCR concluded the project was \u201csuccessful\u201dg and \nresulted in rapid economic growth that has significantly \nbenefited people living in the project area. \n\nThe TA identified excessive staffing, undercapitalization, \nand underutilization of assets as problems of local \nrailways in Sichuan. The organizational commitment to \nmeet customer needs was lacking. An action plan to \ndevelop the required business environment is under \nimplementation. \n\nThe PCR concluded the project was \u201csuccessful\u201dh and \nresulted in rapid economic growth that has significantly \nbenefited people living in the project area. \n\nThe study made recommendations for efficient \ncommercial operation of SXRC and SLRC, including \ncorporatization of SLRC.

The Project reflects Asian Development Bank\u2019s \n(ADB\u2019s)  railway  sector  operational  strategy  for  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC),  which \nincludes promoting sustainable economic growth by improving the efficiency of railway transport \nthrough  reducing  railway  network  constraints  and  enhancing  railway  safety.  The  Project  will \n(i) introduce  new  and  modern  technology  for  responding  more  quickly  to  emergencies\u2014taking \nless  restoration  time,  and  enhancing  safety;  (ii)  provide  capacity  building  support  for  handling \nemergencies more efficiently; and (iii) provide an institutional framework for developing a quick \nresponsive and efficient emergency rescue and restoration system on the PRC railway network. \nThis  will  help  improve  safety  and  reliability;  increase  mobility;  and  reduce  downtime\u2014all  of \nwhich will help achieve higher standards of railway safety, staff productivity, and line capacity. \nThe  consulting  services  will  assist  in  strengthening  institutional  and  capacity  development \nfunctions of the emergency management system on PRC railways. \n \nB.  \n \nThe study will (i) review the system of emergency rescue and restoration management in \n2. \nPRC  railways;  (ii)  identify  the  gaps\u2014particularly  in  the  institutional  setup  of  the  emergency \nmanagement  centers,  facilities  for  training,  nature  of  training  programs  offered,  technical \nliterature,  quality  of  teaching  material,  and  quality  of  trainers;  (iii)  recommend  actions  and \nchanges  in  improving  these  areas;  and  (iv)  provide  training  and  capacity  enhancement \nprograms  for  emergency  management  system.  The  consultants  will  (i)  make  use  of  similar \nstudies  undertaken  by  the  Ministry  of  Railways  (MOR),  (ii)  make  use  of  experience  in  other \nrailways  (international),  and  (iii)  involve  active  participation  of  railway  management.  The \nconsultants  will  recommend  actions  and  changes  that  can  help  MOR  in  improving  the \nemergency  management  system  for  PRC  railways.  The  consultants  will  be  recruited  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to \ntime).  \n \nC. \n \n3. \nAbout  5  person-months  of  consulting  services  will  be  engaged  using  the  biodata \ntechnical  proposal  procedures  based  on  quality  and  cost-based  selection  in  accordance  with \nADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants.  The  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy \n(1998,  as  amended  to  date)  will  be  included  in  all  invitation  documents  and  contracts  for \nconsultants. The consultants will have expertise in institutional and training aspects relating to \nrailway safety. The loan will finance the services of the consultants. \n \n4. \nMOR  will  (i) assign  appropriate  counterpart  staff  to  liaise  with  and  facilitate  the  work  of \nconsulting  services;  (ii) provide  suitable  office  accommodation  and  communications  facilities \ncommensurate  with  requirements;  (iii) assist  the  consultants  in  scheduling  field  visits  and \ndiscussions  with  field  agencies  in  connection  with  the  study;  and  (iv) provide  all  facilities, \ndocumentation, and assistance as may be reasonably requested by the consultants to complete \nthe work. \n\nExpertise and Cost Estimates \n\n \n\n \n\n\fPROJECT PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM \n \n\n \n\nMonitoring \nTool \n\nMajor Indicators to be Monitored \n(Baseline and target figures to be incorporated into PAM) \n\nMonitoring \nAgency  \n\nAccountable \nAgency \n\nReporting Frequency \nSubmission Due Date \n\nOperation Report \n \n\n\u2022  Number of emergency rescue and restoration centers set up \n\u2022  Number of emergency rescue and restoration equipment procured \n\u2022  Number of staff trained \n\u2022  Average rescue time for accidents \n\u2022  Average restoration time for accidents  \n\nMOR \n\nMOR \n\nAnnually  \n(up to 3 years after final \nacceptance) \n\nAPAs AFS  \n\n\u2022  Audited project accounts  \n\u2022  Audited financial statements of MOR \n\u2022  External auditor's checklist  \n\nCNAO \n\nMOR \n\nNotice \n\n\u2022  Notice to proceed/Notice of resettlement completion/Notice of provisional \n\nand final acceptance of the facilities  \n\nMOR \n\nMOR \n\nQuarterly \nProgress \nReport \n\n\u2022  Implementation schedule \n\u2022  Contract award \n\u2022  Disbursements \n\u2022  Physical progress by contract  \n\u2022  Update of project cost estimate  \n \n\nMOR \n\nMOR \n\nMidterm Review \n\ntechnical, institutional, economic, and sector performance \n\nMOR \n\nMOR \n\n\u2022  Evaluation  of  various  aspects  of  project  implementation  including \n\n\u2022  Evaluation  of  various  aspects  of  project  implementation  including \n\nPCR \n\ntechnical, institutional, economic, and sector performance \n\nMOR \n\nMOR \n\nAFS: same as operation \nreport \nAPA: same as quarterly \nprogress report \n\nWithin a reasonable time  \n\nQuarterly until the quarter \nin which physical \ncompletion takes place, or \nthe loan account with ADB \nis closed, whichever is \nlater.

The \ntraffic  forecast  was  based  on  a  two-tier  analysis:  (i)  national  transport  demand  based  on \nhistorical trends correlating socioeconomic parameters, such as gross domestic product (GDP) \nand propensity to travel/ship or demand for railway transport; (ii) national and regional railway \ntraffic  demand  based  on  commodity-specific  analysis  for  major  commodities  currently  using \nother  railway  lines,  roads,  and  inland  waterways.\nTraffic  projections  considered  expected \neconomic  growth,  population  increase,  tourism  development  potential,  local  government \ndevelopment plans, market surveys, and assessments of technical assistance consultants and \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) missions. The historical annual growth rate for tons hauled by \nthe  railway  was  3.82%  from  1995  to  2005.  For  purposes  of  the  evaluation,  tons  hauled  are \nexpected to increase at the rate of 4.2% from 2005 to 2020, and 3% per year for 2020\u20132032. \nFor ton-kilometers (km), the growth rate is forecast at an annual rate of 5.75% for 2005 to 2020, \nand 4.5% for 2020\u20132032. The higher rate of increase for ton-km reflects the longer distances for \ncargoes based on the expansion of the network into the western PRC. Passenger forecasts are \nslightly higher, with the number of passengers increasing at an annual rate of 7.2% during the \nperiod to 2020, and 5% for 2020\u20132032. For passenger-km, the rates are 6.1% during the period \nto 2020 and 5.5% for 2020\u20132032. These forecasts are considered reasonable and in agreement \nwith Ministry of Railways forecasts. \n \nB.  \n \n2. \nThe  economic  evaluation  contains  a  with-Project  scenario  that  includes  the  initial \ninvestment,  and  annual  fixed  and  variable  operating  costs  (including  regular  and  overhaul \nmaintenance  of  equipment).  The  without-Project  scenario  is  implicit  to  the  analysis.  The  with-\nProject  scenario  is  based  on  the  analysis  of  25  sets  of  emergency  rescue  and  restoration \nequipment and staff training. The with-Project scenario is based on the improved response and \nrestoration  times  resulting  from  the  project  investment,  compared  to  current  response  and \nrestoration capabilities.   \n \n3. \nCost.  The  analysis  is  based  on  passenger  and  freight  traffic  that  would  be  diverted  to \nbus  transport  for  passengers,  and  truck  and  waterway  transport  for  freight\u2014based  on  the \ninterruption  of  services  in  specific  railway  sections  (current  average  distance  for  rescue  and \nrestoration is an average of 100 km for 175 emergency rescue and restoration centers, which \nwill  be  downsized  to  136  centers  with  an  average  distance  for  response  and  restoration  of \n125 km). The project benefits and cost were revalued in economic prices by separating the cost \nitems into tradable materials and equipment, non-tradable materials, labor, and land. The prices \nwere expressed in yuan using the domestic price numeraire with a shadow exchange rate factor \nof  1.01  for  foreign  exchange  effects.  A  shadow  wage  rate  factor  of  0.67  was  used  to  put  an \neconomic value on the wages paid to unskilled labor, but not on wages for skilled labor since no \nclear surplus of skilled workers exists. \n \n4. \nBenefits.  Economic  benefits  include  (i)  user  cost  savings  for  freight  and  passenger \ntraffic;  and  (ii)  time  savings  for  diverted  passenger  and  freight  traffic  from  buses,  trucks,  and \nother rail lines. For passenger traffic diverted from road (3.38 million passengers in 2013), the \nuser  cost  saving  (CNY19.60  million  in  2013)  is  the  difference  in  the  passenger  economic  fare \nbetween road and rail transport (CNY0.063 per passenger-km). Passenger traffic time savings \n(CNY0.47  million  in  2013)  are  based  on  the  difference  between  road  and  rail  transport \n(CNY0.0015 per passenger-km). \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 14 \n\n45\n\n \n\n5. \nFor freight traffic diverted from trucks, the economic benefit (CNY139.72 million in 2013) \nis  the  difference  in  shipper  economic  costs  between  truck  and  rail  transport  (CNY0.1934  per \nton-km). For freight traffic diverted from inland waterway, the economic benefit (CNY0.12 million \nin 2013) is the difference in shipper economic costs between inland waterway and rail transport \n(CNY0.0007 per ton-km). \n\n6. \nConclusion. The economic internal rate of return for the Project is 57.2% (Table A14.1). \nSensitivity  analysis  tested  eight  scenarios  to  assess  the  robustness  of  the  results  of  the \neconomic  analysis  (Table  A14.2).  The  initial  capital  cost  would  have  to  be  more  than  1,154% \nhigher than estimated for the economic internal rate of return to fall below the cutoff rate of 12%. \nConsidering the experience of ADB-financed projects in the railway sector, this switching value \nis unlikely to occur. The freight benefits would have to decrease more than 100% to make the \nProject economically nonviable. A 1-year delay in completion does not affect economic viability. \nCombinations of adverse effects of benefits and costs were also tested. The results showed that \nthe Project would maintain its economic viability under plausible scenarios of variability. \n \n\nTable A14.1: Economic Internal Rate of Return \n(constant 2007 economic prices, domestic price numeraire, CNY million) \n\n Year \n\nCapital \n\nBenefits \n\nPassenger \nTraffic \n\nFreight \nTraffic \n\nTotal \n\n Net Benefits\n\nCosts \nOperation  \nand \nMaintenance \n0  \n0  \n0  \n0  \n0  \n10  \n\n11  \n11  \n11  \n11  \n11  \n\n11  \n11  \n12  \n12  \n12  \n12  \n12  \n12  \n13  \n13  \n13  \n13  \n13  \n14  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n\nTotal \n\n(6) \n(31) \n(32) \n(35) \n(6) \n10  \n\n11  \n11  \n11  \n11  \n11  \n\n4  \n11  \n12  \n12  \n12  \n12  \n12  \n5  \n13  \n13  \n13  \n13  \n13  \n(7) \n\n2008 \n2009 \n2010 \n2011 \n2012 \n2013 \n\n2014 \n2015 \n2016 \n2017 \n2018 \n\n2019 \n2020 \n2021 \n2022 \n2023 \n2024 \n2025 \n2026 \n2027 \n2028 \n2029 \n2030 \n2031 \n2032 \n\n(6) \n(31) \n(32) \n(35) \n(6) \n0  \n\n0  \n0  \n0  \n0  \n0  \n\n(7) \n0  \n0  \n0  \n0  \n0  \n0  \n(7) \n0  \n0  \n0  \n0  \n0  \n(20) \n\n0  \n0  \n0  \n0  \n0  \n20  \n\n22  \n23  \n25  \n26  \n28  \n\n30  \n33  \n35  \n37  \n39  \n42  \n45  \n48  \n51  \n54  \n58  \n61  \n66  \n69  \n\n0  \n0  \n0  \n0  \n0  \n140  \n\n148  \n156  \n168  \n181  \n194  \n\n208  \n221  \n233  \n245  \n258  \n270  \n283  \n301  \n319  \n338  \n357  \n376  \n396  \n416  \n\n0  \n0  \n0  \n0  \n0  \n160  \n\n169  \n179  \n193  \n208  \n223  \n\n238  \n254  \n268  \n282  \n297  \n312  \n327  \n348  \n370  \n392  \n414  \n437  \n461  \n485  \n\n(6) \n(31) \n(32) \n(35) \n(6) \n171  \n\n180  \n189  \n204  \n219  \n234  \n\n242  \n265  \n280  \n294  \n309  \n324  \n340  \n354  \n382  \n405  \n427  \n451  \n475  \n479  \n\n \n \n\n \n \n( ) = negative.  \nSource: Technical assistance consultant estimates. \n\n \n \n\nEconomic Internal Rate of Return\nEconomic Net Present Value @ 12%\n\n57.2%\n902.58\n\n \n\n \n\n\f46 \n\n \n\nAppendix 14 \n\nParameter \n\nEIRR \nInitial Investment \nAdditional Investment \n\nAnnual Fixed and Variable \nCosts \nTotal Costs \nTotal Freight Benefits \nTotal Passenger Benefits \nDelay Implementation by 1 Year \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n\nTable A14.2: Sensitivity Analysis \n\nReference \nValue \n57.2% \n\nChange \nBy \n\nRevised \nEIRR \n\nSensitivity \nIndicator \n\n \n\n50% \n100% \n\n \n\n \n\n46.51% \n57.19% \n\nSwitching \nValue (%)a \n \n\n1,154.45% \n23,510.50\n% \n1,872.81% \n\n693.14% \n(100.63%) \n(664.40%) \n13.37% \n\nNPV@12% \n(CNY million) \n902.58 \n863.49 \n898.74 \n\n873.66 \n\n863.51 \n723.19 \n834.65 \n781.93 \n\n683.00 \n\n0.09 \n0.00 \n\n0.05 \n\n0.14 \n0.99 \n0.15 \nNPV \ndeclines by \n1.22 \n\n60% \n\n56.13% \n\n30% \n(20%) \n(50%) \n\u2014 \n\n49.61% \n51.59% \n55.25% \n49.89% \n\nReduce Benefits by 20%; \nIncrease Costs by 10% \n\u2014 = not calculated, ( ) = negative, EIRR = economic internal rate of return, NPV = net present value. \na Switching value indicates the percentage change in a variable required for the NPV to become zero. \nSource: Technical assistance consultant estimates. \n\n(20%); \n+10% \n\n48.07% \n\n \n\n(82.21%) \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 15 \n\n47\n\n \n\n \n\n \nA. \n\nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY \n\nLinkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \n\nIs  the  sector  identified  as  a  national \npriority in country poverty analysis?   \n\n   Yes \n   No \n\nIs the sector identified as a \nnational priority in country poverty \npartnership agreement?   \n\n   Yes \n   No \n\nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in the People\u2019s Republic of China: \n\nSafer railway transport will benefit all passengers.
