The additional financing will also \ninclude  a  capacity  development  component  to  introduce  sustainable  practices  in  road  asset \nmanagement  and  road  maintenance.  The  overall  project  will  facilitate  regional  connectivity, \nimprove  the  quality  and  efficiency  of  road transport  services,  and  promote  inclusive  economic \ngrowth. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\n3. \nAfghanistan\u2019s  economy  has  suffered  from  prolonged  conflict,  which  has  destroyed  the \ncountry\u2019s minimal economic infrastructure and institutions. More than 2.5 million Afghans  have \nbeen driven from their homes and livelihoods. Since the fall of Taliban regime in 2001, the country \nhas received billions of dollars in international assistance, which  increased the country\u2019s gross \ndomestic product fivefold to more than $20 billion since 2002. The country is beginning to recreate \nan  economy  that  can  address  and sustain the  needs of  its  people,  but  stable and sustainable \neconomic development is still needed. To this end, the Government of Afghanistan has developed \na range of policies and strategies with support from its development partners. However, not all of \nthem have been successfully implemented. The 2008\u20132013 Afghanistan National Development \nStrategy,1 the country\u2019s first strategy paper for poverty reduction, set the context for rebuilding the \ncountry  by  (i)  addressing  poverty  through  private-sector-led  equitable  economic  growth,  and  \n(ii) exploiting the economy\u2019s growth potential. \n \nAfghanistan\u2019s  fragile  and  conflict-affected  situation  has  devastated  its  roads.  By  1994, \n4. \nabout 80% of the 42,000-kilometer (km) network was in disrepair.2 In 2002, the government began \nmajor reconstruction programs, which focused on rebuilding damaged or destroyed roads, as well \nas rehabilitating roads that had fallen into disrepair because of a prolonged lack of maintenance. \nNearly  8,000  km  of  roads  have  been  reconstructed  or  rehabilitated.  The  government  and \ndevelopment partners have focused their efforts on reconstruction, but there is an emerging need \nto ensure the  sustainability  of  past  investments.  The  ongoing  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB) \nstudy on operation and maintenance (O&M) found that 85% of the road network remains in poor \ncondition and only 50% is in serviceable, year-round condition. \n \n5. \nFinancial and institutional sustainability are among the main challenges Afghanistan faces \nin providing O&M for its road network. The Ministry of Public Works (MPW) has been unable to \nfully implement the various approaches proposed in its 2006\u20132013 O&M strategy that aimed to \ncreate a viable and efficient road maintenance system to keep the roads open year-round and \nallow people and goods to move safely and efficiently within Afghanistan.3 A lack of policies on \n                                                \n1  Government of Afghanistan. 2008. Afghanistan National Development Strategy. Kabul. \n2  Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2003. Afghanistan's Transport Sector on the Road to Recovery. Manila. \n3  Government of Afghanistan. 2006. Operation and Maintenance Strategy. Kabul. \n   http://www.carecprogram.org/uploads/docs/AFG-Public-Works-Strategy.pdf  \n\n\froad user charges and O&M financing complicates these financial and institutional challenges. \nFinancially,  Afghanistan  is  not  expected  to  be  self-reliant  in  the  next  5  years.    Institutionally, \nAfghanistan  needs  to  address  organizational  and  human  resources  issues  from  an  O&M \nperspective. Organizationally, the mandates of the different government authorities responsible \nfor the road network must be properly delineated. Functionally, MPW lacks the specialized system \nrequired to ensure adequate and accountable operations. A tool for planning and managing road \nO&M  nationally  does  not  exist.  The  ad  hoc  approach  of  this  system  must  be  integrated  and \nproperly developed to enable systematic planning and management of road network O&M.  \n \n6. \nRealizing  the  importance  and  seriousness  of  the  issue,  Afghanistan\u2019s  development \npartners have contributed $150 million for O&M of the road network since 2011. Under the $109 \nmillion  Road  Sector  Sustainability  Program  of  the  United  States  Agency  for  International \nDevelopment  (USAID),  the  government  and  development  partners  have  agreed  on  short-  and \nlong-term plans. In the short term, a 5-year transfer process has been defined, with road O&M \nfunded by development partner contributions in the first year and by road user fees in the fifth \nyear. In the long term, three autonomous entities\u2014a road authority, road fund, and transportation \ninstitute\u2014will  be  created  to  ensure  sector  sustainability.  The  road  authority  will  manage  road \ndevelopment and maintenance, the road fund will provide sustainable financing for road O&M, \nand the transportation institute will train Afghan professionals and build their capacity in transport \nengineering. Apart from road development, the World Bank\u2019s $332 million National Rural Access \nProgram also allocated (i) $21 million for routine and periodic maintenance of paved and unpaved \nsecondary roads, and (ii) $1.5 million for a road network inventory. \n \nUnder Transport  Network  Development  Investment  Program Tranche  4,4 ADB  provides \n7. \n$5 million to finance a pilot O&M subproject which aims to (i) assess MPW\u2019s overall O&M capacity, \nand (ii) develop a methodology that best suits Afghanistan and will be used in future road O&M \nprojects.  The  maintenance  works  include  overlay  in  some  sections,  pothole  patching,  crack \nsealing, surface sealing, mill and fill, and roadside maintenance. The pilot subproject addressed \nbasic O&M issues on the first 50 km of the Kabul\u2013Jalalabad Highway (from Kabul to Surubi) by \nimproving the international roughness index (IRI) from 8\u201312 to 4\u20135.  \n \n8. \n In  early  2016,  ADB  estimated  about  $55.0\u201360.0  million  will  be  needed  to  address  the \nmaintenance work on Afghanistan\u2019s national ring road section between Kabul and Kandahar; and \nthe strategic highway section between Kabul and Jalalabad. ADB approved the current project of \n$25.5 million from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources on 31 October 2016 with a grant effectiveness \ndate of 5 January 2017.5 The current project was designed to (i) initiate the establishment of a \nsustainable road maintenance system for the country\u2019s major highways and (ii) develop MPW\u2019s \nO&M  capacity.  The  project\u2019s  two  major  components  are  road  maintenance  and  a  road  asset \nmanagement system (RAMS). Two sections of national highways were selected for maintenance \nbecause of their economic and strategic importance: (i) Kabul\u2013Jalalabad Highway from Surubi to \nJalalabad  and  (ii)  the  Kabul\u2013Kandahar  Highway  from  Kabul  to  Ghazni.  The  project  will  also \ndevelop  a  RAMS  as  the  primary  decision-making  support  tool to help MPW plan  and manage \nroad  O&M.  ADB  financed  the  current  project  through  a  grant  of  $25.5  million  from  its  Special \nFunds resources. The government provided $500,000 in counterpart support in the form of office \nspace and staff. \n                                                \n4  ADB.  2014.

Manila (Grant 0508-AFG). \n\n2 \n\n \n\n \n\n\fThe current project is performing well based on the following assessment:6 \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nDelivery of expected outputs. The current project is on track to meet the intended \noutputs: (a) national highways in the southern region maintained and (b) O&M and \nroad  management  capacity  enhanced.  The  condition  survey  for  the  Kabul\u2013\nJalalabad  Highway  and  Kabul\u2013Ghazni  Highway  has  been  completed.  The \nengineering designs for an 85-km section of the Kabul\u2013Jalalabad Highway and a \n50-km section of the 135 km of the Kabul\u2013Ghazni Highway have been completed. \n\nImplementation  progress.  The  project  is  progressing  as  scheduled.  Three \nindividual  consultants  for  road  asset  management  system  (RAMS)  namely  the \nteam leader, deputy team leader, and transportation engineer have been recruited \nand mobilized in June 2017. The inception report was submitted in August 2017. \nRecruitment  of  the  remaining  RAMS  consultants  is  in  process.  The  bidding \ndocuments for procurement of civil works package 1, which covers 35 km of the \nKabul\u2013Jalalabad Highway have been reviewed and tendered. The contract award \nis expected by September 2017. The bidding documents for civil works package \n2, which covers 50 km of the Kabul\u2013Jalalabad Highway, have been completed and \nsubmitted to ADB for review. The total contract amount expected to be awarded \nby November 2017 is about $15.0 million. \n\nCompliance with safeguard policy requirements. The project is category C for \nthe environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous people. It focuses on \nroad maintenance within the boundaries of the right-of-way of existing carriageway \nof the Kabul\u2013Jalalabad and Kabul\u2013Ghazni highways. The project does not have \nany  adverse  social  or  environmental  impacts  because  of  the  limited  scale  and \nscope of the maintenance works, and the use of small machinery and equipment \nfor the activities. The project complies with the ADB\u2019s safeguard requirements. \n\n(iv)  Management  of  risks.  The  project  has  measures  to  manage  risks.  ADB  has \nsupported the program management office (PMO) in preparing bidding documents \nand bid evaluation reports, and in supervising contract execution. In addition, by \ncontracting out work in small packages for national competitive bidding, ADB has \nsupported  the  development  of  the  local  market  in  Afghanistan.  This  follows  the \nADB  and  the  government\u2018s  agreed  approach  on  enhancing  project  delivery  in \nAfghanistan. ADB conducted recruitment of consultants in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time), while \nthe government negotiated and signed the contracts with the consultants. \n\n(v) \n\nProject performance rating. The current project was rated on track in the project \nperformance rating from grant effectiveness up to Q2 2017. \n\n \n10. \nThe  current  project  intends  to  provide  MPW  with  a  RAMS  that  will  support  objective \nplanning, improve road serviceability, and ensure cost-effective use of available resources. The \nprospect of additional financing was raised in the report and recommendation of the President for \nthe current project (footnote 5). The additional financing is needed to (i) fill the financing gap of \n$30.3 million; and (ii) include the section from Kabul to Kandahar, between Ghazni and Kandahar \nin southeastern Afghanistan, which was part of the original scope of the 2016 need assessment \nfor maintenance of the ring road.  \n\n                                                \n6  Summary of Project Performance (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n9. \n \n\n \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\n  \n11. \nThe  additional  financing  will  support  scaling  up  of  O&M  practices.  This  will  include \noverloading  control  by  providing  weighbridges  in  the  key  locations  of  Afghanistan\u2019s  regional \nhighway. It will help consolidate development outcomes by establishing sustainable road asset \nmanagement and road maintenance practices. Overall, the project meets the eligibility criteria for \nadditional  financing.  The  additional  financing  will  enhance  the  intended  impact  of  the  current \nproject by utilizing the existing implementation arrangements, achieving results quickly. \n \nThe overall project is in line with the strategic objectives, as described in ADB\u2019s country \n12. \noperations  business  plan  (COBP),  2017\u20132019,  of  ensuring  continual  support  for  road  network \nO&M  in the  short  term  and  developing  the  government\u2019s O&M  capacity  in  the  long term.7 The \nCOBP  identifies  investments  in  developing  a  safe,  reliable,  and  efficient  transport  network \nconnecting urban and rural centers as priorities for the transport sector and are in line with the \ngovernment\u2019s strategies for development of the sector. \n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n13. \nThe impact and outcome for the overall project will be the same as those for the current \nproject.  The  overall  project  is  aligned  with  the  following  impact:  increased  sustainability  of \nAfghanistan\u2019s  road  transport  sector,  as  highlighted  in  Afghanistan\u2019s  O&M  Strategy  2006.  The \noverall project will have the following outcome: improved road connectivity and safety.8 \n \nC. \n\nOutputs \n\nThe proposed additional financing will enable the expansion of the project outputs. The \n14. \nincremental  outputs  will  be  periodic  and  routine  maintenance9 works  on  about  328  km  of  the \nSouthern  National  Ring  Road  between  Ghazni  and  Kandahar  and  other  locations  along  the \nSouthern  National  Ring Road as  needed. The  proposed additional financing  activities will  also \nexpand  the  capacity  development  component  to  include  strengthening  MPW\u2019s  capability  in \noverloading control. \n \nD. \n \n15. \nThe  overall  project  is  estimated  to  cost  $56.3  million,  including  taxes,  duties,  and \ncontingencies  (Table  1).  The  estimated  climate  change  finance  (adaptation)  amount  is  $0.48 \nmillion. \n \n\nInvestment and Financing Plans \n\n                                                \n7  ADB. 2017.

Manila. \n8  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n9  Routine maintenance comprises a range of small and simple activities, usually carried out at least once a year, but \nusually widely dispersed. Typical activities include roadside verge clearing and cutting back encroaching vegetation, \ncleaning  of  silted  ditches  and  culverts,  patching  and  pothole  repair,  and  light  grading  or  reshaping  of  unsealed \nsurfaces. Periodic maintenance occurs less frequently, usually after several years. Works can include re-graveling, \nresurfacing, resealing, and repairs to structures.  \n\n\fTable 1: Project Investment Plan  \n($ million) \n \n\nCurrent \nAmounta \n\nAdditional \nFinancingb \n\nItem \nA. \n \n \n \n \nB. \n \na  Refers to the original amount.

ADB  funding  for  the \nproject includes the financing of taxes and duties,11 which is justified because (i) the amount will \nnot be an excessive share of the project investment plan, and (ii) the financing of taxes and duties \nis material and relevant to the project\u2019s success. This is in line with ADB\u2019s Operations Manual.12 \nThe government's in-kind contribution to project financing will be for incremental administrative \nexpenses,  communications,  and  office facilities, as  required. The World Bank  also follows  this \npractice  in  Afghanistan.  The  financing  plan  is  in  Table  2.

The latest debt sustainability analysis determined that Afghanistan had a high risk of debt distress \nand was therefore eligible to receive 100% of its Asian Development Fund allocation. \n\n11 The costs for taxes and duties include the business receipt tax estimated at 7%, the fixed tax on imports of 2%\u20137%, \nand customs duties of 2.5%\u201316.0%. These costs do not represent an excessive share of the financing plan and are \nwithin  applicable  country  partnership  strategy  parameters.  ADB.  2005.

The  condition  survey  of  the  project  roads,  including \nquantities and cost estimates, is being prepared as part of tranche 4 of the Transport Network \nDevelopment Investment Program (footnote 4). \n \n19. \nProcurement  financed  by  the  ADB  grant  will  be  undertaken  in  accordance  with  ADB's \nProcurement  Guidelines.  Advance  contracting  is  proposed  to  improve  project  readiness.  The \nadditional financing will be used for variations of the ongoing consulting contracts under the RAMS \ncomponent of the current project. The consultants, who are familiar with the work and challenges \nin a country classified as a fragile and conflict-affected situation, will continue to supervise the \nadditional financing component. \n \n\nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \n\nAspects \nImplementation period \nEstimated completion \ndate \nManagement \n\nArrangements \nJanuary 2018\u2013June 2021 \nJune 2021 (estimated grant closing date: 31 December 2021) \n\n(i)  Executing agency \n(ii)  Implementing \n\nMinistry of Finance \nMinistry of Public Works \n\nagency \n\nConsulting services \n\n(iii) Implementation unit  Program management office, 35 staff \nIndividual \nconsultants \n\n$1.0 million \n\n107 person-months \n(30 person-months \ninternational, 77 \nperson-months \nnational) \n\n6 \n\n \n\n\fAspects \nProcurement \n\nRetroactive financing \nand/or advance \ncontracting \n\nDisbursement  \n\n1 contract \n\n6 contracts \n\n$2.5 million  \n\n$24.0 million \n\nArrangements \nInternational \ncompetitive bidding \n(goods) \nNational \ncompetitive bidding \n(civil works) \nAdvance contracting will be applied for civil works and consulting \nservices.

This is well below \nthe  acceptable  technical  standards,  which  suggest  that  roughness  along  a  route  of  this  kind \nshould be within an IRI range of 4\u20135.14 The proposed maintenance along this route will address \nthe pavement deficiencies identified and improve ride quality, pavement life, and overall safety. A \nteam of local engineers with the support of MPW\u2019s O&M department will conduct the condition \nsurvey of the project roads, including quantities and cost estimates, as part of tranche 4 of the \nTransport Network Development Investment Program (footnote 4). It is expected to be completed \nin  December  2017.  The  detailed  maintenance  and  repair  methodology  will  be  based  on  the \noriginal methodology developed under the pilot O&M subproject and implemented in the current \nproject. \n \n21. \nPreliminary climate risk screening shows that the project\u2019s climate change risk is medium, \neven  though  the  project  scope  only  includes  partial  overlay  and  repair  of  pavement.  The \ndevelopment of awareness of climate risks and knowledge of mitigation measures for the road \nproject design will be considered as part of the RAMS component in the current project. \n \nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n22. \nThe  project  will  help  achieve  the  envisaged  benefits  of  an  improved  transport  corridor, \nincluding lower transport costs and shorter travel times. The economic evaluation of the project \nwas undertaken using ADB\u2019s Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects15 and followed the \nanalytical framework of the highway development and management model.16 The traffic forecast \nis  based  on traffic  counts  on the  project road in early  2015.  Based on  the 2015  average daily \n                                                \n14 Sayers, M.W.

Manila. \n16 World Road Association. 2002. Highway Development and Management Model-4 Version 2. Paris. \n\n \n\n \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\ftraffic volume, annual normal traffic growth is forecast at 3% for 2018\u20132040. Project costs and \nbenefits  are  calculated  based  on  a  comparison  of  with-  and  without-project  scenarios.  The \neconomic costs are (i) capital cost, including physical contingencies, but excluding taxes; and (ii) \nO&M, notably the cost of periodic maintenance assumed to be undertaken at 6-year intervals. \nThe economic benefits are savings in vehicle operating costs resulting from the improved project \nroad and time savings. The results of the economic analysis show that the project is economically \nfeasible  with  an  estimated  economic  internal  rate  of  return  of  44.9%.  This  confirms  ADB\u2019s \nexperience with maintenance projects, which tend to generate high economic returns. Sensitivity \ntests  confirmed that  the project  would remain viable  if the  envisaged  project costs  increase or \nbenefits were reduced. No financial analysis was undertaken because the project road will not \ngenerate revenue. \n \nThe current project intended to address two financial sustainability concerns: the lack of \n23. \nan effective O&M regime and a chronic shortage of O&M funds. In the next 5 years, government \nfunding for maintenance is unlikely to meet the requirements to preserve the value of the road \nassets. The government would have to raise about $251 million annually to meet the maintenance \nneeds of its core road network. In 2015 the government collected $83 million through road user \nfees and taxes, but more needs to be done. Given the country\u2019s narrow economic base, fragile \nsecurity  situation,  and  competing  demands  for  scarce  budget  resources,  Afghanistan  is  not \nexpected  to  be  financially  self-reliant  and  will  need  to  rely  on  contributions  from  development \npartners to finance road maintenance. Accordingly, development partners should balance their \nassistance between investments and O&M support. An increase in O&M funds is necessary but \nnot  sufficient  to  ensure  road  asset  sustainability.  Institutional  strengthening  to  create  sufficient \ncapacity for managing future maintenance will be developed as part of the current project and in \nconjunction with the overall project. \n \nC. \n\nGovernance \n\nGovernance  is  a  major  challenge  in  Afghanistan.  The  project  has  been  designed  to \n24. \nmitigate  these  risks,  especially  in  the  areas  of  financial  management  and  procurement.  An \nupdated financial management  assessment  of  MPW and  its  PMO took  into consideration  their \noverall capacity, including funds-flow arrangements, governance, staffing, budgeting, accounting \nand financial reporting systems, internal control procedures, financial information systems, and \ninternal  and  external  auditing  arrangements.  This  assessment  found  that,  from  a  financial \nmanagement  perspective, the  overall  control risk  is  moderate.  MPW and  PMO  have adequate \nexperience  and  capacity  in  financial  management  to  manage  the  project  funds  as  well  as \nadequate funds flow, accounting systems, and budgeting arrangements. The 2015 restructuring \nof  the  PMO  significantly  improved  its  overall  capacity.  The  PMO\u2019s  finance  department  staff \nincludes a manager, five accountants, and a trainee. MPW conducts internal audits periodically, \nand annual external audits have yielded satisfactory results since ADB\u2019s engagement with MPW \nin 2003. MPW is responsible for ensuring an adequate audit trail; the annual financial statements \nare audited by an independent auditor acceptable to ADB in accordance with auditing standards. \n \n25. \nImprovement  is  needed  in  accounting  policies  and  procedures  and  reporting  and \nmonitoring.  In  accounting  policies  and  procedures,  the  PMO  has  been  using  a  manual  book \naccounting  approach,  which  is  inferior  to  modern  accounting  software.  The  PMO  has \ndemonstrated the capacity to monitor and report project finances based on ADB requirements. \nHowever,  the  submission  of  some  project  financial  statements  has  been  delayed.  Thus,  the \nupdated financial management assessment recommended that (i) modern accounting software \nbe procured and installed as soon as possible so that PMO staff can be trained to use it; and (ii) \nan international financial management specialist be recruited to help PMO staff conduct financial \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\fmanagement,  ensuring  that  the  audited  project  financial  statements  are  submitted  in  a  timely \nmanner. Financial management risks and risk mitigation measures will be reviewed and updated \nthroughout the project\u2019s life. \n \nAll goods and works will be procured in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines, \n26. \nand all consulting services will be recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants. ADB agreed to the government\u2019s request to recruit the individual consultants, which \nwill ensure the transparency of the procurement process and mitigate the risk of delays. MPW will \nremain responsible for negotiating and signing the contracts, issuing the notice to proceed, and \nsupervising  the  contracts.  This  is  consistent  with  the  agreement  between  ADB  and  the \ngovernment  of  Afghanistan  on  the  approach  to  enhance  project  delivery  and  the  objective  of \nADB\u2019s  policy  on  additional  financing  to  promote  efficiency  gains  through  timely  and  seamless \ntransition from project preparation to implementation. The policy requirements and measures are \ndescribed in the PAM (footnote 13). \n \n27. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government,  MOF,  and  MPW.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary \nmeasures are described in the PAM (footnote 13). \n \nD. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n28. \nThe  poverty  and  social  assessment  conducted  for  the  project  revealed  the  extent  of \npoverty in the country, including (i) food insecurity affecting one-third of the population, (ii) a lack \nof access to improved water resources, and (iii) limited access to education and health services. \nThe  gender  assessment  revealed  high  maternal  and  infant  mortality  rates,  limited  mobility  of \nwomen compared with that of men, and overall low status of women. While the project\u2019s long-\nterm  impact  is  expected  to  improve  women\u2019s  physical  access  to  education,  health,  and  other \nservices  by  shortening  travel  times  and  making  roads  safer,  these  are  indirect  benefits.  The \nproject will promote equal work pay for men and women. The project is categorized as no gender \nelements. \n \nE. \n\nSafeguards \n\n29. \nAll  three  safeguard  categories  are  categorized  as  C  since  (i)  no  land  acquisition  or \ninvoluntary resettlement is required, as the maintenance work will be carried out within the right-\nof-way of existing roads; (ii) no indigenous peoples, as defined by ADB for operational purposes, \nlive  within  the  project  area;  and  (iii)  the  environmental  impact  will  be  minimal,  not  requiring \nmitigation actions. Thus, no land acquisition and resettlement plan, indigenous peoples plan, or \ninitial environment assessment and environmental monitoring plan will be required. \n \nF. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n30. \nThe  major  residual risk  is  the  political  stability  of  the  country,  which has  led  to  security \nthreats  to  development  operations.  With  the  proposed  mitigation  measures,  the  overall  risk \nassessment is moderate, while the integrated benefits and impacts are expected to outweigh the \ncosts. Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail in \nthe risk assessment and risk management plan.17 \n \n\n                                                \n17 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\nRisks \nImplementation  of  periodic  maintenance \nhas  been  limited  by  weak  capacity  and \ninadequate  budget  flows,  resulting  in \nunsustainability of road maintenance \n\nLack of sustainability of road investment, \nwhich leads to rapid road deterioration \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nMitigating Measures \nDevelopment partners are helping the government to \ncreate a road authority, road fund, and transportation \ninstitute.
