It is dominated \nby banks, most of which are state-owned. Until recently, the state- \nowned  commercial  banks \n(SOCBs)  have  been  used  as \ninstruments of policy and state-owned enterprise (SOE) financing \nat  the  expense  of  their  commercial  orientation  and  financial \nstrength. The Agriculture Promotion Bank (APB) is still considered \na policy bank, although the Government\u2019s vision is to transform it \ninto  a  market-based  rural  finance  institution.  Branches  of  foreign \nlimited  operations,  and  serve \nbanks \npredominantly foreign clients. \n\nin  Vientiane  maintain \n\nthe \nrisk, \n\nlarge \nthe \n\nfiscal  costs,  and  associated \nIn  addition \nto \nmacroeconomic \nlegacy  of  state  ownership  has \ncontributed  to  a  governance  system  that  may  not  be  fully \ncompatible  with  sound  banking  practices.  The  unpredictable \ncharacter  of \nthe \nentrepreneurial activity needed to achieve the higher growth path \nrequired to graduate from least-developed-country status by 2020.  \n\nsuppresses \n\ncommercial \n\nsystem \n\nthe \n\nIn  a  market  oriented  economy  the  financial  sector  is  strategically \nimportant.  The  rationale  for  the  Banking  Sector  Reform  Program \n(BSRP)  is  therefore  the  need  to  open  the  sector  to  increased \nprivate participation through improved governance and incentives \nin banks, and a strengthened environment for the enforcement of \nloan contracts. The Program supports meaningful changes in the \nway the commercial system operates and addresses conditions to \nextend  financial  services  to  the  large  part  of  the  population  that \nhas no access to such services.  \n\nloan \n\nin  a  broad \n\nis  embedded \n\nframework  of \nThe  BSRP \nmacroeconomic,  fiscal,  and  commercial  reform  supported  by  the \nInternational  Monetary  Fund  (IMF)  through  its  poverty  reduction \nand  growth  facility  (PRGF)  approved  in  April  2001,  and  by  the \nWorld  Bank  through  its  financial  management  adjustment  credit \n(FMAC) approved in June 2002 \n\n \nBorrower \n \nClassification \n\n \nRationale \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nEnvironment \nAssessment \n\nC  \nThe environmental implications are minimal. \n\n \n\n \n\n\fii \n\n \n\nObjectives and Scope  \n\n \n\nFinancing Plan \n\nThe  objective  is  to  support  Government  efforts  to  foster  efficient \nfinancial  intermediation  and  ensure  a  sound  banking  system \ncapable of supporting growth and rural outreach. Specifically, the \nProgram will  \n\nsupport  sound  banking  through  improved  governance \npractices;  \n\nmobilize  the  judiciary  to  use  a  strengthened  legal  system \nand  the  Bank  of  the  Lao  PDR  (BOL)  to  use  an  effective \nprudential  regulation  system  to  bring  failed  borrowers, \nstrategic defaulters, and unsound banks to account; \n\nfoster  a  competitive,  predictable commercial environment \nfor all banks; and \n\nprovide  the  opportunity  for  a  range  of  institutional  models \nand methodologies for extending financial sector outreach. \n\n \nTo achieve this objective, the BSRP loan will support programs in \nfive interdependent areas:  \n\nrestructuring  the  banking  sector  through  reducing  the \nnumber of SOCBs, increasing competition, and operational \nrestructuring of the remaining SOCBs; \n\nimproving  the  legal  framework  and  judicial  capacity  to \nsupport loan collection and collateral enforcement; \n\nfacilitating  access  to  finance  by  small-  and  medium-sized \nenterprises (SMEs) through a secured transactions system \nand improved financial disclosure; \n\ndeveloping  a  policy  and \nconducive to rural and micro finance; and \n\ninstitutional  environment \n\nundertaking  strategic  planning  for  the  period  (2006\u20132010) \nbeyond the current restructuring program. \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n \nThe  Government  has  requested  the  Asian  Development  Bank \n(ADB) to provide a loan of $15 million from ADB\u2019s Special Funds \nresources. This amount was determined through ADB\u2019s continued \ndialogue with the Government. It takes into account the depth and \nscope  of  the  proposed  policy  reforms,  and  the  estimated  short-  \nand  medium-term  adjustment  costs  associated  with  adopting  the \npolicy  matrix.  The  Borrower  will  be  the  Lao  PDR.  The  loan  will \nhave a repayment period of 24 years, including a grace period of \n8 years. An interest rate of 1% per annum will be charged during \nthe  grace  period  and  1.5%  per  annum  thereafter.  The  loan  is \nexpected  to  be  utilized  over 48 months from loan effectiveness. \nThe  proceeds  may  be  used  to  finance  eligible  imports  for  the \nperiod 180 days before loan effectiveness. \n\n\fProgram Period and \nTranching \n\n \nExecuting Agency \n\n \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\niii \n\nIt  is  proposed  that  the  loan  consist  of  three  tranches  that  will  be \ndisbursed when ADB is assured that the conditions for release are \nsatisfied.  The  first  tranche  of  $5  million  will  be  made  available \nfollowing  loan  effectiveness.  It  is  envisaged  that  the  second \ntranche of $5 million will be disbursed within 19 months after the \nfirst tranche release, subject to the Government's compliance with \nconditions.  The  third  tranche  of  $5  million  is  expected  to  be \ndisbursed  within  15  months  after  the  second  tranche  release, \nsubject to the Government's compliance with conditions. ADB and \nthe  Government  will  review  progress  in  implementing  specified \npolicy  actions  set  out  in  the  policy  matrix  3  months  before  the \nscheduled tranche release. \n \n\nimplementation  of \n\ntheir  components  under \n\nThe  Executing  Agency  will  be  the  BOL,  which  will  have  overall \nresponsibility  for  ensuring  timely  program  implementation  and \nreporting  to  ADB  on  progress  made,  problems  encountered, \nremedial actions taken during the previous quarter, and proposed \nprogram activities during the next quarter. Implementing agencies \nwill  include  BOL,  Ministry  of  Finance  (MOF),  Ministry  of  Justice \n(MOJ), and the SOCBs, which will have responsibility for effective \nday-to-day \nthe \nProgram.  \n \nThe  Executing  Agency  will  establish  a  bank  restructuring \nimplementation committee (BRIC), chaired by the deputy governor \nof  BOL.  The  BRIC  will  be  empowered  to  oversee  program \nimplementation  and  ensure  that  the  proposed  reforms  are \nundertaken  in  accordance  with  the  agreed-upon  timetable.  The \nmembers will initially include the chairmen of the four committees \nthat  designed  the  program  (Bank  Restructuring  Committee,  NPL \nCommittee,  Human  Resource  Committee,  and  the  Information \nTechnology Committee). \n \nThe  BRIC  will  coordinate  closely  with  (i)  the  implementing \nagencies;  (ii)  other  key  departments  in  BOL,  such  as  the  Bank \nand Financial Supervision Department (BFSD) and Internal Audit; \n(iii) other ministries with interest in the BSRP, such as Ministry of \nLabor  and  Social  Welfare  and  Ministry  of  Security;  and  (iv)  other \nrelevant TA steering and policy committees, particularly the Rural \nand  Micro  Finance  Committee  and  the  prospective  program \nmanagement  unit  of  the  European  Union  (EU)  Bank  Training \nProject.  The  BRIC  will  meet  at  least  quarterly  to  review progress \nreports and guide program implementation. \n \n\n\fiv \n\n \n\nProcurement \n\n \nCounterpart Funds \n\n \nProgram Risks \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nthe \n\nfinancial  performance  of \n\nThe  loan  will  finance  the  full  foreign  exchange  costs,  excluding \nlocal  duties  and  taxes,  of  imports  procured  in  and  from  ADB\u2019s \nmember  countries,  other  than  those  specified  in  ADB\u2019s  list  of \nineligible  items  and  items  financed  by  other  multilateral  and \nbilateral  official  sources.  Items  eligible  under  ADB  loan  will  be \nprocured through normal commercial practices for procurement by \nthe  private  sector  or  standard  Government  procedures  for \nprocurement  by  the  public  sector  that  are  acceptable  to  ADB.  In \nthe  case  of  goods  commonly  traded  on  international  commodity \nmarkets,  procurement  will  follow  procedures  appropriate  to  the \ntrade and acceptable to ADB.  \n \nThe  Government  will  use  counterpart  funds  to  finance  the  local \ncurrency  costs  of  implementing  the  Program  and  other  activities \nconsistent with the objectives of the Program.   \n \nAs  the  Program  is  based  on  the  assumption  of  a  stable \nmacroeconomic environment, any violation of this could adversely \naffect \nthe  SOCBs.  The \nmacroeconomic  risk  is  being  minimized  through  the  monitored \nfiscal  and  monetary  framework  under  the  IMF\u2019s  PRGF,  attention \nto  better  financial  reporting  and  limits  to  credit  expansion  under \nthe  World  Bank\u2019s  FMAC,  and  the  emphasis  on  sound  banking, \nfinancial  disclosure,  and  performance  monitoring  under  the \nproposed BSRP. \n \nThe second risk concerns the ability and will of the Government to \nimplement  the  broad  reform  program  and  the  possibility  that \nprovincial authorities may be opposed to reform. The risk is being \nmitigated by a continuation of the year-long program of ownership \nbuilding;  strong  aid  coordination;  a  front-loaded,  performance-\nbased  program  design;  and \nflexible  program  parameters. \nGovernment  commitment  to  carry  out  and  sustain  the  range  of \nreforms under the Program is demonstrated by up-front actions of \nmerit already taken.  \n \nThe  third  risk  is  that  the  proposed  reforms  will  be  undertaken  by \nministries,  officials,  and  bankers  that  are  relatively inexperienced \nand lacking in technical knowledge. This risk is addressed through \na  significant  amount  of  TA  in  the  form  of  resident  advisors, \ncoupled  with  formalized  training  courses  and  basic  training  in \nstandardized  loan  documents  and  required  financial statements. \nIn addition to resident international banking advisors (IBAs) inside \nthe SOCBs, there will be resident advisors to the BRIC and to the \njudiciary.  The  deployment  of  multiple  advisors \nto  help \nimplementation will be balanced with country ownership concerns \nthrough  care  in  designing  terms  of  reference,  which  maintains \nappropriate accountability. \n \n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nTechnical Assistance \n\n \n\nThe Technical \nAssistance Grant \n\nRelated Technical \nAssistance  \n \n\n  v\n\nThe  fourth  risk  is  that  restructuring  the  SOCBs  may  result  in \nredundancies  and  this  could  lead  to  resentment  and  grassroots \nresistance, especially in the provincial branches. Consultation and \nawareness  building  have  begun  and  will  continue  throughout \nimplementation.  The  Government, \nthe \nstakeholders  and  as  agreed  upon  with  ADB,  has  also  committed \nthat  mitigation  measures  will  be  an \nthe \nrestructuring  program,  should  there  be  adverse  effects  on \nvulnerable SOCB staff.  \n\nin  consultation  with \n\nintegral  part  of \n\nThe objective of the technical assistance (TA) grant is to support \nthe Government\u2019s efforts  to  implement  the  reform  program.

The  report  also  describes  proposed  technical  assistance  (TA)  for \nBanking  Sector  Reform  and  Judicial  Strengthening,  and  if  the  Board  approves  the  proposed \nloan, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, will approve the TA. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE MACROECONOMIC CONTEXT  \n\n2. \nThe  country\u2019s  transition  to  a  market-oriented  economy  was  initiated  in  1986  with  the \nadoption of the New Economic Mechanism. During the initial period, the Government pursued a \nnumber  of  important  reforms,  most  notably  redefining  and  limiting  the  role  of  the  state  in  the \nallocation  of  resources.  Key  actions  included  price  and  trade  liberalization,  introduction  of \nbusiness  legislation,  the  return  of  agriculture  production  to  private  households,  privatization  of \nstate-owned  enterprises  (SOEs),  and  establishment  of  a  two-tiered  banking  system.  The \ntransition had a strong impact on the economy and growth averaged 6-7% during the period.  \n \n3. \nReform momentum weakened during the middle of the 1990s. Beginning in 1997, on the \nheels  of  the  Asian  crisis,  the  Government  pursued  an  expansionary  fiscal  policy  financed  by \ncentral bank credit. Given the already high degree of currency substitution, inflation increased to \n128.4%  in  1999  and  the  kip  depreciated  sharply.  Losses  accumulated  in  the  banks  and \nenterprises,  as  unhedged  firms  and  banks  were  unable  to  offset  the  detrimental  effect  of \ninflation and currency depreciation. Recognizing the severe cost of high inflation, the authorities \nembarked on a stabilization program in mid-1999 and, over the next 18 months, reestablished a \nstable macroeconomic framework. \n \n4. \nSince  2000,  the  Government\u2019s  macroeconomic  management  has  been  successful, \nalthough the tenuous fiscal situation and persistent dollarization have kept the macroeconomic \nstability  fragile.  In  April  2001,  the  International  Monetary  Fund  (IMF)  approved  a  3-year \narrangement  under  the  poverty  reduction  and  growth  facility  (PRGF).  Macroeconomic \nperformance  in  the  first  year  of  the  PRGF  was  generally  satisfactory,  as  inflation  remained  at \naround 7% and the economy expanded at 5.2% despite a slowdown in the regional economy. \nPreliminary  evidence  suggests  buoyant  economic  activity  in  the  first  half  of  2002,  contained \ninflation at 7.5%, and a relatively stable exchange rate.  \n \n5. \nThe linkage between macroeconomic stability and bank soundness is particularly acute \nin the Lao PDR. The financial structure of the state-owned commercial banks (SOCBs) is highly \nsensitive  to  price  and  exchange  rate  movements  due  to  large  exposure  in  foreign  currency \nassets  and  growing  foreign  currency  liabilities.  Financial  sector  restructuring,  in  concert  with \nother  sectoral  reforms,  is  therefore  needed  to  prevent  the  economy  from  entering  into  the \nvicious circle of bank losses exacerbating macroeconomic instability, which, in turn, will create \nfurther  losses  and  greater  macroeconomic  instability.  The  fragile  macrostability  and  the \nvulnerability of bank soundness to renewed price and exchange rate pressures make the task \nurgent. \n \n6. \nThe  Government  recognizes  that  sustaining  the  recent  success  in  stabilizing  the \neconomy  depends  on  continued  diligence  in  macroeconomic  management  and  deepening \nstructural  reforms  to  help  propel  the  economy  to  a  higher  growth  path.  Moreover,  for  wider \npoverty  reduction,  increased  growth  will  have  to  be  complemented  with  increased  fiscal \nresources to enable Government expenditure to address activities with high social return. Fiscal \npressure brought on by large losses in the financial sector restricts the Government in fulfilling \nits social sector mandate. \n \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\n7. \nLooking to the future, the Government and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) signed a \npoverty reduction partnership agreement (PRPA) on 28 September 2001 that lays out a short- \nmedium-  and  long-term  vision  for  reducing  poverty  in  the  Lao  PDR.  The  PRPA  signals  ADB\u2019s \nsupport  for  the  Government  program  to  develop  the  economy  and  assistance  to  enable  the \ncountry  to  graduate  from  least  developed  status  by  2020.  The  key  pillars  include  sustained \nmacroeconomic  stability,  increased  growth  through  an  improved  commercial  environment, \ndevelopment  of  a  financial  system  that  supports  private  sector  growth,  considerable \nimprovement in terms of outreach, and promotion of good credit culture. As an integral part of \nthe PRPA and to complement the fiscal, monetary, and structural efforts under the IMF PRGF \nand World Bank financial management adjustment credit (FMAC),1 activities targeted under the \nBSRP loan form pillars for a privately driven commercial system that is needed to support new \nproductive activities and increased access to financial services.  \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE SECTOR \n\nA. \n\nSector Description and Performance \n\n1. \n\nOverview \n\n8. \nThe financial sector remains small relative to other countries and the services provided \nare  limited.  Financial  services  reach  only  a  small  part  of  the  population.  The  ratio  of  broad \nmoney to GNP increased from 7.5% in 1990 to around 20% today. The sector is dominated by \nbanks and there is only one insurance company. There are no leasing companies, and no other \nnon bank financial institutions. Financial services reach only a small part of the population and \nthe  services  delivered,  with  a  few  exceptions,  are  not  being  provided  on  a  sustainable  or \nefficient basis.  \n \n9. \nPrivate sector development (PSD) objectives started with efforts to privatize, lease and \nliquidate a large number of SOEs; establish a legal basis for private production; and build legal \nand  judicial  institutions.  However,  efforts  in  this  area  slowed  during  the  mid-1990s. Similar to \nhistorical  trends  in  other  countries,  there  is  currently  in  the  Lao  PDR  a  pervasive  financial \nindiscipline  as  many  commercial  principles  taken  for  granted  in  post-transition economies are \nonly now being considered as desirable and inalienable. New laws and regulatory frameworks \nare  not  well  understood  and  are  inconsistently  enforced,  resulting  in  a  poorly  defined  and \nopaque legal framework for business. As a result, rule-based discipline in the economy is weak, \nleading to weak borrowers and weak banks. \n \n\n2. \n\nCommercial Banking \n\nThe Lao PDR banking sector is small at around $400 million2 in total assets. It employs \n10. \naround  1,500  people  and  is  dominated  by  one  relatively  large  and  two  smaller  SOCBs,  which \naccount for 70% of the total gross assets of the banking system.3 Branches of several foreign \nbanks  started  operating  in  Vientiane  in  the  early  1990s,  but  deficiencies  in  the  banking \nenvironment, particularly the legal framework, and limitations on their activities have contained \ntheir contribution to the domestic economy.4  \n \n\n                                                 \n1 The preparation and design of the BSRP loan was coordinated with the PRGF presented to the IMF Board on April \n\n2001 and the FMAC presented to the World Bank Board in June 2002. \n\n2  Banque pour le Commerce Exterieur  (BCEL)  is  the  former  foreign  trade  bank  (accounting  for  50%  of  total  gross \nbanking assets). Lane Xang Bank (LXB) and Lao May Bank (LMB) account for about 20% of total banking assets. \n3 In comparison, the Vietnamese banking sector has $11.7 billion, while Cambodia has $245 million of assets in its \n\nrudimentary banking sector. \n\n4  There is a joint-venture (Lao-Viet) and a private domestically owned bank (Vientiane Bank) but both are very small. \n\n\f \n\n3   \n\n11. \nThe current state-owned banking sector was initiated in the Lao PDR in March 1988 with \nDecree  no.  11  and  finalized  with  the  promulgation  of  the  Central  Bank  Law  in  1990 which \nestablished  a  two-tiered  system.  Three  commercial  banks  were  established  immediately  on  a \nregional  basis,  followed  by  four  more  in  1990  and  1991  to  provide  banking  services  to  the \nprovinces. The establishment of the banks came with portfolios of bad assets built up by the old \nState Bank of Lao. Privatization and liquidation of many SOEs in the early 1990s further eroded \nthe asset quality of the balance sheet. Shortly after issuing the first set of banking regulations5 \nthrough Decree 3, the Government capitalized the banks in mid-1993, bringing them to sound \nlevels of capital adequacy with bond and cash injections.  \n \n12. \nSOCB  performance  since  the  first  capitalization  in  1993  has  generally  fallen  short  of \nexpectations. In 1999, the Government merged six small unsustainable regional and provincial \nbanks into two new SOCBs (LXB and LMB), and planned to clean up pre-2000 nonperforming \nloans  (NPLs)  for  them  and  for  BCEL  in  exchange  for  governance  improvements  and \nmeasurable  operational  change.  In  2000  and  2001  however,  the  three  SOCBs  continued  to \ngenerate  losses.  The  losses  were  caused  by  (i)  continuation  of  asset  deterioration  due  to \ncontinued  credit  indiscipline  of  banks  and  borrowers;  (ii)  large  revaluation  losses  due  to \ncurrency devaluation effects on unhedged balance sheets, resulting from poor lending practices \nin  the  past  and  the  legacy  of  macroinstability;  and  (iii)  high  noninterest  expenses  for  staff, \nbranches, and capital.  \n \nThe  principal  issues  facing  the  SOCBs  today  therefore  have  both  stock  and  flow \n13. \ndimensions. The legacy of foreign currency loans to unhedged customers, directed lending for \nnoncommercial activities, loans to SOEs, and nonpayment of central and provincial authorities \nto bank customers for government contract work left a $50 million deficit in the balance sheets. \nOn the flow side, despite some recent success in credit policies, NPL collection, and corporate \nmanagement, the improvements have not been sufficiently deep nor have they been sustained \nlong enough to meet the formidable challenge of a significant change in financial performance. \n \nSOCBs continue to suffer from a wide range of fundamental institutional weaknesses. \n14. \nInternal factors range from limited human resource capacity, inadequate information technology, \noverstaffing,  inadequate  attention  to  prudent  risk  management,  to  the  lack  of  effective \ngovernance structures\u2013boards, committees, policies, and procedures. External factors that have \nfrom \nlimited \nmacroeconomic instability prior to 2000, deficiencies in the judicial and loan security system, a \nhistorical need to support government policy objectives and SOEs, and private sector borrowers \nwith limited capacity to present bankable projects. \n \n15. \nThe  Government  deemed  improvements  to  the  banking  environment  and  in  the \ninstitution\u2019s  operations  (governance  improvements)  to  be  prerequisites  to  reviving  the  banks\u2019 \nbalance  sheets.  However,  initiation  of  a  comprehensive,  front-loaded  program  of  operational \nrestructuring recently took on a new urgency. Improved financial transparency in recent months \nindicated  an  unsustainable  growth  in  NPLs  since  2000\u2013particularly  in  one  bank\u2013and  a \nworrisome growth in assets of questionable quality in another, raising the specter of accelerated \nasset deterioration and a significant increase in restructuring cost. \n \n\ninclude  debt  overhang \n\nimprovements  on \n\nfinancial  position \n\nthe  SOCB \n\n3. \n\nPrivate Sector Provision of and Access to Bank Finance \n\n16. \nThe Government recognizes that inevitably the private sector has a major role to play in \nfuture development and that a sound banking system is essential if the private sector is to meet \nits  full  potential.  Currently,  private  sector  firms  are  small\u2013over  90%  are  owner-operated\u2013and \n\n                                                 \n5 The regulation (i) defined the criteria for establishing a commercial bank, (ii) defined the business of a commercial \n\nbank, (iii) defined the rules for the boards of directors, and (iv) gave BOL oversight responsibility.  \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\nonly  a  small  proportion  of  small-  and  medium-sized  enterprises  (SMEs)  have  access  to \ncommercial  bank  financial  services.  Historically,  private  enterprises,  particularly  SMEs,  have \nbeen crowded out of SOCB financing by larger firms. Private firms also have difficulty obtaining \nfinancing  from  the  private  banks  in  Vientiane  because  of  an  inadequate  system  for  collateral \nvaluation  and  enforcement,  along  with  a  general  lack  of  capacity  to  prepare  basic  financial \nstatements and present bankable projects.  \n \n17. \nIn order to address these problems, a sec ured transactions law was introduced in 1996 \nand was made operational through an implementing decree in 2000. However, the system has \nnot  become  functional  despite  the  legal  requirements  that  all  bank  loans  must  be  securitized. \nThree problems exist: (i) deficiencies in the original law and implementing decree impede their \napplication and enforcement, (ii) lack of functioning computerized secured transactions registry, \nand (iii) limited knowledge and training for participants under the new system. Similarly, despite \na law requiring that all medium-size companies prepare audited financial statement and despite \ncredit policies and prudential regulations requiring borrower\u2019s financial information as the basis \nfor  a  loan  or  a  restructuring,  preparation  of  financial  statements  by  banks  borrowers  is \npractically nonexistent.  \n \n\n4. \n\nMicro and Rural Finance  \n\n18. \nThe Lao PDR remains largely agricultural and rural. Eighty-five percent of the workforce \nis engaged in agriculture, which generates over half of the gross domestic product (GDP) and, \n90% of the poor live in rural areas. However, the financial sector in the Lao PDR has, to date, \nachieved a low level of outreach in rural areas. Surveys estimate that only 11% of rural people \nhave the ability to access formal financial institutions, and only 1% currently save in the banking \nsector.   \n \n19. \nGovernment  policies  and  institutional  weaknesses  also  contribute  to  the  low  outreach. \nCurrent  policy  to  support  access  to  rural  finance  has  been  implemented  primarily  by  the \nAgriculture  Promotion  Bank  (APB).  The  government  subsidizes  APB's  operations  and  controls \nAPB\u2019s  interest  rates.  In  addition,  APB\u2019s  lending  has  been  largely  directed  by  the  Government, \nwhich has contributed to operating losses and a high level of problem loans. The actions distort \nAPB\u2019s  service  provision  to  clients  and  result  in  misallocation  of  resources,  crowding  out  of \ncommercial  finance  by  microfinance  institutions  (MFIs)  and  other  banks,  and  the  need  for  the \nGovernment to periodically recapitalize APB. Furthermore, current restrictions on interest rates \nand  private  ownership  limit  the  development  of  MFIs,  hence  hindering  the  development  of  a \ncompetitive  marketplace.  Institutionally,  APB  carries  out  a  multitude  of  financial  and  non-\nfinancial activities, reflecting its mixed mandate as a financial institution and development organ \nof  the  state.  As  a  result,  its  operations  are  inefficient,  and  management  autonomy  and \nresponsibility  are  limited.  Finally,  prior  to  2002,  APB  had  never  been  audited  and  it  has never \npublished  its  financial  statements,  making  its  financial  situation  (and,  therefore,  costs  to  the \nbudget) unclear to stakeholders. \n \n20. \nGiven  the  difficult  operating  environment  for  rural  finance,  the  Government  envisions  a \nvariety  of  financial service models to support the development of the rural sector. Though still \nunderdeveloped,6 pilot projects are beginning to demonstrate the validity of microfinance in the \nLao PDR. To date, however, the growth and sustainability of these pilots have been hindered by \nlack  of  clarity  (i)  in  the  legal  and  regulatory  environment  for  rural  and  micro  finance,7 and (ii) \nregarding the appropriate role of APB in the future development of the sector. \n                                                 \n6 Currently, the three largest MFIs collectively reach about 10,000 clients, and an estimated 1,600 village revolving \nfunds  serve  about  8,000  active  borrowers.  Few  of  these  are  operating  on  a  sustainable  basis  because  of \noperational inefficiencies and caps on the interest rates that they charge.   \n\n7 There are currently no regulations for MFIs other than the credit cooperative regulations and APB's own credit union \n\nregulations.  \n\n\f \n\n \nB. \n\nIssues and Opportunities \n\n5   \n\n21. \nThe  Government  has  adopted  a  goal  of  achieving  sustained  poverty  reduction  and \ngraduating from least developed country status by 2020. This will require (i) continued price and \ncurrency stability, (ii) the development of a sound and efficient financial system, and (iii) a robust \nprivate sector operating by commercial rules and reaping commercial rewards. \n \n22. \nThese goals were stated objectives of previous interventions and remain priorities of the \nGovernment\u2019s  strategy,  as  they  continue  to  be  key  prerequisites  to  sustained  growth  and \npoverty reduction. The BSRP loan builds on these past interventions by (i) carrying forward to \nthe next stage areas initiated under previous financial sector operations, such as strengthening \nthe legal and judicial system to support commercial transactions; (ii) revising activities that were \nless  successful  but  even  more  urgent  than  before,  such  as  restructuring  the  SOCBs;  and  (iii) \nsupporting reforms in new strategically important areas, such as rural and micro finance. \n \n23. \nADB\u2019s  support  for  the  Lao  PDR\u2019s  financial  system  started  at  the  beginning  of  the \ntransition.  The  first  program  loan8  supported  the  formulation  of  the  legal,  regulatory,  and \ninstitutional  framework  for  a  two-tiered  banking  system,  monetary  management,  and  private \nsector  development.  The  second  program  loan9  furthered  the  initiatives  covering  monetary \nmanagement, and financial and legal infrastructure, and extended the financial infrastructure to \nbanking by strengthening prudential supervision and borrower credit information.  \n \n24. \nThese  programs  were  successful  in  (i)  helping  the  Government  manage  the  transition \nfrom  the  monobank  directing  credit  by  administrative  order  to  the  mixed  system  of  today;  (ii) \nbuilding  the  basic  legal,  financial,  and  institutional  infrastructure  needed  to  operate  monetary \npolicy  through  a  financial  system;  (iii)  creating  greater  transparency  and  directing  attention  to \nthe  financial  accountability  of  institutions;  and  (iv)  improving  the  skill  sets  of  bankers  with \nextensive  technical  assistance in credit risk management, financial management and strategic \nplanning. \n \n25. \nBoth programs also sought to build sound state-owned banks by cleaning up their NPL-\nimpaired  balance  sheets,10  but  subsequent  performance  fell  short  of  expectations.11 Although \nthese  programs  were  successful  in  many  respects,  they  had  limited  success  in  improving \ngovernance arrangements both within and without the SOCBs . In addition to detrimental moral \nhazard  issues  arising  from  the  approach  to  balance  sheet  restructuring,  insufficient  attention \nwas given to fundamental operational change and to introducing incentives regimes inside the \nbanks.  The  inability  of  the  judicial  and  prudential  regulatory  systems  to  enforce  discipline  and \nensure soundness12 weakened program outcomes. \n \n26. \nBecause  of  the  limited  operational  change  and  the  low  degree  of  financial  discipline \nthroughout  the  economy,  SOCBs  have  chronically  underperformed  and  the  banking  system \nrequires  capital  support  despite  capitalization  less  than  10  years  earlier.

Manila. \n\n12  The  legal,  regulatory,  and  supervisory  framework  was  strengthened  under  the  second  Financial  Sector  Program \n\nLoan but has not been effectively applied to date. \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\nposition and direction of the SOCBs pose a macroeconomic threat, as restructuring costs are \nrising  at  more  than  1%  of  GDP  every  2  years.  Though  possibilities  for  short-run turnaround is \nlimited  given  the  entrenched  NPLs  and  the  highly  exposed  foreign  exchange  position,  the \nmacroeconomic  situation  still  requires  urgent  attention  to  address  the  long-run  health  of  the \nbanks.  \n \n27. \nEqually  importantly,  the  continuation  of  NPLs  signals  that  substantial  improvement  in \nfinancial  discipline  is  required  to  enable  the  banking  sector  to  reorient  itself  and  provide  the \nconditions to attract private sector participation. Global experience shows that a sudden move \ntoward  private  ownership  of  banks  immediately  following  a  lengthy  period  of  state  ownership \ncould  be  risky  since  the  level  of  institutional  development  and  sophistication  in  the  banking \nenvironment  would  be  insufficient  to  attract  foreign  banks  and  other  reputable  domestic \ninvestors.13  Thus,  simultaneously  increasing  private  bank  participation,  preparing  SOCBs  for \npotential  investment  and  addressing  weaknesses  in  the  incentive  system  would  seem  to  be \nmost prudent strategy. \n \n28. \nGiven  the  strategic  importance  of  the  financial  sector,  the  rationale  of  the  Program  is \nbased  on  a  need  to  sustain  the  hard-earned  macroeconomic  stability  while  improving  a \ncommercial incentives regime for banking, strengthening the enabling environment, particularly \nin  the  area  of  loan  contract  enforcement,  and  opening  the  commercial  market  to increased \nprivate  participation.  At  the  same  time,  the  lack  of  access  of  a  large  part  of  the  population  to \nfinancial  services  makes  it  imperative  to  improve  the  sustainable  outreach  of  the  financial \nsector.  The  recently  enhanced  Government  awareness  of  the  role  of  the  financial  sector  in \noverall macroeconomic stability and growth provides an opportunity to foster meaningful change \nin the daily operations of the commercial system. \n \n29. \nTo capture this opportunity, the BSRP builds on the successes of previous interventions \nwhile incorporating lessons learned from a decade of assistance to the Lao PDR. Such lessons \ninclude:  (i)  the  reform  must  be  owned  and  implemented  by  the  Government;  (ii)  strong \ncoordination  among  all  aid  agencies  from  design  through  implementation  allows  a  unified \ndialogue  and  supports  Government  ownership;  (iii)  moral  hazard  is  minimized  only  if \nfundamental operational changes precede financial restructuring; (iv)  in the absence of market-\nbased  corporate  governance,  operational  restructuring  requires  performance  incentives \n(rewards  and  penalties)  and  a  focus  on  outcomes  as  success  indicators;  (v)  TA  should  be \ndeployed  alongside  a  set  of  policy  actions  as  mutually  reinforcing  activities;  and  (vi)  SOCB \nrestructuring should be seen as  an  opportunity  to  make  other  parts  of  the  commercial  system \noperate. \n \n30. \nThe  current  reform  effort  embodies  a  strong  sense  of  Government  ownership.  A  high-\nlevel policy workshop in February 2001 was the culmination of a Bank of the Lao PDR (BOL)-\nled  in-depth  review  (Supplementary  Appendix  A) 14  and  policy  dialogue  on  the  state  of  the \nfinancial and banking sector in the Lao PDR. The workshop then initiated a year-long series of \nopen,  inclusive  workshops  to  build  consensus,  knowledge,  and  capacity  to  design  the  bank \nreform  program.  The  result  is  a  multiyear,  multisector,  Lao-owned  reform  program  that  views \noutcomes, not processes, as the objective. \n \n31. \nIn terms of aid coordination, the strategic importance of the financial sector to the future \ngrowth of the Lao PDR economy is evident through the wide interest and support from the aid \ncommunity.  The  Government\u2019s  consensus -building  process  involved  extensive  consultations \nwith the aid community and resulted in a program that actively promotes the deployment of aid \nagency programs in an integrated and mutually reinforcing way. In particular, the current reform \n\n                                                 \n13 The World Bank, 2001 Finance for Growth: Policy Choices in a Volatile World, Oxford University Press, pp137-138. \n14 Bank of Lao PDR, ADB, and the World Bank. 2002. Lao PDR: Financial Sector Note. \n\n\f \n\n7   \n\nprogram  is  being  supported  by  a  series  of  interventions  from  the  three  international  financial \ninstitutions  (IFIs)  around  a  common  policy  matrix.  The  IMF  PRGF  provides  the  overall \nmacroeconomic framework, monitors structural benchmarks, and identifies ADB and the World \nBank as assisting the Government in designing and implementing key structural reforms for the \nbanking  and  enterprise  sectors.15  The  World  Bank  FMAC  lays  the  foundation  for  bank \nrestructuring  by  focusing  on  (i)  greater  transparency  and  improved  reporting;  (ii)  autonomy  of \nthe  management  in  appointing  the  SOCB  management  team,  deciding  on  lending  and  setting \ninterest rates; (iii) limits on credit expansion; and (iv) addressing a major cause of NPLs through \nits SOE restructuring component. Assistance from other sources is also being deployed within \nthis common framework (Appendix 1).16 \n \n32. \nThe goal is to build financial discipline, a credit culture, and corporate governance as the \nfoundation  of  a  commercial  system.  Specifically,  BSRP  will  (i)  cause  banks  to  \u201cearn\u201d \nreplacement  of  pre-2000  loans  as  a  reward  for  substantial  operational  changes  that  yield \nmeasurable  results;  (ii)  administer  incentives  through  performance  benchmarks  in  key \ngovernance areas with penalties for underperformance; (iii) improve the effectiveness of human \nresource capacity building by deploying formal training together with on-the-job training by the \ninternational banking advisors (IBAs); (iv) through the NPL resolution process, force NPL cases \nthrough  the  court  system  to  foster  a  demand  for  judicial  strengthening  and  an  enforcement \nprogram;  (v)  use  the  experience  and  scale  economies  generated  by  SOCB  restruc turing to \nassist  in  APB  restructuring  in  the  later  phases  of  the  program;  and  (vi)  through  good  credit \npolicies, cause private enterprises to prepare financial statements and business plans, thereby \ncreating a demand for accounting and other business services. \n \n\nIV. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROGRAM   \n\nA. \n\nObjectives and Scope  \n\n33. \nThe objective of the Program is to support Government efforts to foster efficient financial \nintermediation and ensure a sound banking system capable of supporting economic growth and \nextending  rural  outreach.  The  objective  will  be  achieved  through  an  improved  operating \nenvironment for the banking sector, the immediate application of commercial principles in SOCB \noperations, and increased diversity in forms of rural financing, as described in the Government\u2019s \ndevelopment policy letter (Appendix 2).  \n \n34. \nThe BSRP loan will support initiatives in four specific areas: (i) restructuring the banking \nsector, including reducing the number of SOCBs, improving the commercial environment for all \nsound financial institutions and carrying out an extensive program of operational reform of the \nremaining  SOCBs  involving  shrinking  the  balance  sheets  and  aggressive  NPL  collection;  (ii) \nimproving the legal framework for loan collection and collateral enforcement; (iii) improving the \nsecured  transactions  system,  and  better  financial  disclosure;  and  (iv)  developing  a  market-\noriented  policy  and  institutional  environment  conducive  to  rural  and  micro  finance.  As  the \nProgram supports a major step toward future financial and private sector development, strategic \nplanning for the 2006-2010 post-restructuring period will be undertaken. \n \nB. \n\nPolicy Framework and Actions \n\n35. \nThe  BSRP  supports  a  framework  designed  after  more  than  a  year  of  preparation  and \ndiscussions with  the  Government,  IMF,  and  World  Bank.  It was  developed  with  recognition  of \nthe  duration  needed  to  strengthen  implementation  capacity,  and  the  urgent  need  to  achieve \n                                                 \n15 In addition, IMF is providing TA in support of the program\u2019s banking supervision goals. \n16 The Australian Agency for International Development financed audits of SOCBs covering the last 5 years and the \nEuropean  Union  (EU)  is  providing  formal  capacity  building  for  SOCB  and  BOL  staff.  There  is  also  strong \ncoordination with other aid agency projects in the banking sector.  \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nmeasurable and credible change in SOCBs\u2019 performance. As such, the policy matrix (Appendix \n3) reflects immediate change in the behavior of the SOCBs, coupled with medium-term reforms \nin  the  legal  framework,  the  judiciary,  banking  supervision  regulations,  and  rural  finance.  The \nprogram framework is in Appendix 4. \n  \n\n1. \n\nDevelop the Banking Sector  \n\n36. \nRestructuring  of  the  banking  sector  is  a  high  priority  in  the  Government\u2019s  program  for \nmacroeconomic  stability  and  private  sector  development.  The  BSRP  loan  will  support  the \nGovernment\u2019s  operational  strategy  of  eliminating  unsound  parts  of  the  system. The strategy \nentails  (i)  structural  changes  in  the  sector;  (ii)  major  operational  change  inside  the  SOCBs, \nincluding human resource development; (iii) a capital buildup program for the SOCBs centered \non intensive efforts at resolving current NPLs;  and (iv) complementary measures in other parts \nof the environment to build a credit culture and give good borrowers access to finance. \n \n\na. \n\nPrior Actions \n\nRecognizing the urgency of banking reforms, the Government has already taken steps to \n37. \nprepare  for  restructuring  of  SOCB  operations.  Prior  actions  cover  four  areas:  (i)  improved \nfinancial  disclosure  and  restraints  on  credit  growth,  (ii)  improved  SOCB  governance  and \nautonomy, (iii) broad agreement on and commitment to principles and actions underlying SOCB \nrestructuring,  and  (iv)  initiation  of  actions  to  restructure  the  SOCBs,  including  NPL  collection \nactivities.  \n \n38. \nTo limit the moral hazard pressures before restructuring, a set of interim measures was \nput  in  place  in  2001  and  2002  to  (i)  strictly  apply  BOL  regulations  on  loan  classification  and \nprovisioning, (ii) ensure external audits are conducted and financial reporting to the supervisory \nauthorities  is  of  high  quality,  (iii)  prohibit  lending  to  borrowers  in  default,  and  (iv)  apply  sector-\nwide  ceilings  on  SOCB  credit  growth17  as  well  as  bank-specific  restrictions  in  the  case  of \nunsustainable  asset  quality.18  SOCB  governance  was  strengthened  through:  (i)  shareholder \ncommitment  to  the  application  of  commercial  principles  to  all  lending;  (ii)  increased board and \nmanagement autonomy in key decision making areas including credit, branch management, and \ninterest rate determination; and (iii) limits on the credit authority of branches. \n \n39. \nThe Government completed preparations for a comprehensive restructuring program for \nthe operations and finances of SOCBs and APB.  In the case of SOCBs, restructuring principles \nwere  defined  in  the  memoranda  of  understanding  for  restructuring  signed  in  March  2002,  a \nbusiness plan framework agreed to in May 2002, culminating with detailed plans committed to in \nthe form of governance agreements. The principles embodied in these agreements include (i) a \nperformance-based  approach \nthe  case  of \nunderperformance; (ii) phased, conditional, and limited capital injections; and (iii) deployment of \nIBAs in the SOCBs.  \n \n40. \nImplementing  the  Program  for  both  the  SOCBs  and  APB  has  begun.  The  plan  for \nconsolidating the two smaller banks has started and the process of appointing new members of \nthe boards and management team of the two banks and their IBAs is at an advanced stage. The \nNPL  resolution  plan  that  began  with  a  comprehensive  review  of  each  account  has  already \nyielded  more  than  KN40  billion  in  collections  by  the  three  SOCBs  this  year.  For  APB,  an \noperational diagnostic and the first ever external audit were completed, and a corporate vision \nto guide restructuring has been adopted by the APB board of directors. \n \n\nto  restructuring  and  contingent  actions \n\nin \n\n                                                 \n17 PRGF program requirements include yearly targets on SOCB credit expansion.  For 2002, the ceiling is 18%.  \n18  A FMAC condition prevents any expansion of the net risk portfolio if NPLs are greater than 15%.  \n\n\f \n\n9   \n\nb. \n\nStructural Changes in the Banking Sector \n\n41. \nTo  achieve  structural  change  in  the  banking  sector,  the  BSRP  loan  will  support,  in  the \nfirst  year,  (i)  a  reduction  in  the  number  of  SOCBs  from  three  to  two,  (ii)  a  shrinking  of  the \nbalance sheets of the remaining SOCBs, and (iii) a more open environment conducive to sound \nbanking practices.  \n \n42. \nComplementing this shrinkage of the unhealthy parts of the banking sector, the Program \nsupports  the  development  of  a  forward-looking  Government  strategy  to  encourage  a  diverse, \ncompetitive, and commercially oriented financial sector. A key objective of the strategy will be to \nincrease the contribution of private banks to economic growth. Disciplined SOCBs, coupled with \nreforms  in  the  judiciary  and  improved  financial  disclosure  of  borrowers,  will  encourage  private \nsector  banks  to  participate  more  in  the  Lao  economy.  In  the  meantime,  the  Government  has \nprovided some relief from new capital requirements for foreign banks currently operating in the \nLao PDR and will introduce a new Decree Law on Commercial Banks, which will promote good \nbanking, good governance, and competitive environment. \n\n \n\nc. \n\nOperational Restructuring of the Remaining SOCBs \n\n43. \nBoard  chairpersons  and  management  teams  will  take  the  major  responsibility  for \nmanaging  the  restructuring  while  at  the  same  time  absorbing  intensive,  on-the-job training. To \nguide  the  restructuring  program,  the  Government  and  SOCBs  are  introducing:  (i)  \u201cgovernance \nagreements,\u201d which involve binding commitments on the part of the SOCBs, BOL, and Ministry \nof  Finance  (MOF)  to  carry  out  certain  responsibilities  in  support  of  operational  and  financial \nrestructuring; and (ii) deploying IBAs inside the SOCBs.  \n \n44. \nThe  governance  agreement  defines  the  principles  and  responsibilities  behind  the \nrestructuring  program,  supported  by  specific  performance  targets,  quantitative  benchmarks, \nperformance  rating  methodology,  monitoring  and  reporting  arrangements,  and  contingent \nactions  in  case  of  underperformance.  Compliance  with  the  provisions  will  be  gauged  through \nquarterly  reviews  and  biannual  performance  ratings,  substantiated  by  yearly  external  audits. \nPerformance targets and, if necessary, corrective actions will be updated annually considering \nthe past year\u2019s performance and the following year\u2019s goals.  \n \n45. \nTo  facilitate  program  implementation,  IBAs  working  in  the  SOCBs  will  (i)  develop the \ninterim  and  comprehensive  operational  policies  and  procedures  for  approval  by  the  SOCB \nboards; (ii) oversee improvements in systems and procedures; (iii) support the new approach to \ngovernance  and  help  achieve  the  performance  targets;  (iv)  provide  direct  advice  on  specific \nindividual  transactions  of  material  importance  to  the  bank,  focusing  on  large  credit  decisions; \nand  (v)  implement  cost-effective  right-sizing  activities.  To  ensure  efficient  and  timely \nrestructuring, the Government will borrow from ADB to finance for 3 years, two resident advisors \nin  each  SOCB.  Outline  terms  of  reference  (TORs)  for  the  IBAs  are  found  as  an  annex  to  the \ngovernance agreements.  \n \n46. \nThe first year of operational restructuring will involve a comprehensive program to train \nthe new board of directors and management teams. Board and management committees will be \nestablished  and  governed  by  comprehensive  operational  policies  and  procedures  and \nsupported by better operations and reporting methodology. Decision-making will be transparent \nand  based  on  commercial  principles,  and  systems  ensuring  accurate  recording  of  decision \nmaking and transactions will be installed. Branches will be streamlined and brought into a more \ncentralized  organizational  structure.  Compliance  will  focus  on  the  adoption  and  strict \nimplementation  of  new  sets  of  operational  policies  and  procedures.  The  initial  year\u2019s \nperformance  will  also  be  assessed  through  quantitative  benchmarks  on key elements such as \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\nNPL ratios, collection performance, and foreign exchange exposure, with profitability and capital \nadequacy targets added in subsequent years.  \n \n\nd. \n\nHuman Resource Development \n\nA particularly challenging constraint to financial sector development is the limited human \n47. \ncapacity and basic skills in banking and business. Therefore, a key aspect of the Program is the \nstrong emphasis on accelerated development of skills and capacity of the boards, management, \nand staff within the SOCBs. The human resource development program within the SOCBs will \ninclude  (i)  on-the-job  training  from  working  side  by  side  with  the  IBAs  to  adopt,  manage,  and \nimplement  more  advanced  banking  procedures  and  techniques;  (ii)  formal  courses  and \nscholarships through the Program\u2019s potential association with a comprehensive European Union \n(EU)  Bank  Training  Program19  and  other  training  opportunities;  (iii)  a  performance  reward \nsystem,  which  views  these  prized  scholarships  as  a  key  incentive  for  performance  and  for \nretaining the best performing employees in the sector; and (iv) a program to match existing staff \nskills with better defined job requirements.  Clients of and service providers to SOCBs will also \nbenefit from the training programs and workshops in specific areas such as preparing financial \nstatements and loan and security contracts, and managing problem loans. \n \n\ne. \n\nFinancial Restructuring of the SOCBs \n\nThe Program supports a phased and conditional buildup of capital in the two remaining \n48. \nSOCBs as a prerequisite to their long-term safety and soundness. Guided by past experience, \nthe  Government  is  following  a  cautious  approach  to  financial  restructuring,  recognizing  that \nmoral hazard concerns must be addressed for the program to reach sound levels.20 The NPLs \nin the system will be resolved through a three-pronged approach to capital build-up: (i) SOCB \ncollection  of  NPLs  made  during  2000-02 (ii); Government compensation for NPLs which were \nmade  prior  to  2000;  and  (iii)  additional,  non-government  capital  to bring the capital adequacy \nrates  to  sound  levels.  Table  1  divides  the  NPL  portfolio  of  the  banks  into  two  blocks  of  loans: \nNPLs made prior to21 and those made after 1 January 2000.  \n \n49. \nThe  most  urgent  task  is  for  SOCBs  to  actively  use  creditor\u2013debtor  negotiations, \nsupported  by  threat  of  legal  action,  to  resolve  the  high  level  of  NPLs  that  have  built  up  in  the \nsystem in the last 3 years  \u2013 especially those originating from private sector enterprises with a \ncapacity  to  repay.  These  NPLs  will  be  addressed  through  an  aggressive  program  of  case-by-\ncase  resolution,  focusing  on  cash  collection  and/or  legal  action.  By  encouraging  SOCBs  to \npursue  borrowers  in  default,  the  Program  not  only  supports  improvement  in  the  soundness  of \nthe financial system. It will also create demand for a more reliable and active legal and judicial \nsystem for debt enforcement.  A time-bound  NPL  resolution  plan  will  include  interim  resolution \ntargets  of  resolving  2000-02  NPLs  by  mid-2005,  including  at  least  KN90  billion  in  cash \ncollections.  To  track  progress  and  learn  lessons  from  each  NPL  case,  the  following  will  be \nimplemented:  (i)  resolving  private  sector  cases,  through  structured  negotiation  and/or  judicial \naction;  (ii)  resolving  NPLs  from  SOEs  through  the  SOE  restructuring  process; and (iii) special \nhandling of accounts that became NPLs due to government arrears on public sector contracts.22 \n\n                                                 \n19  The  proposed  EU-funded  (Euro-TAL)  Bank  Training  Program   will  design  and  conduct  an  extensive  in-house \ntraining program targeted at SOCB management and functional departments over a period of 24 months beginning \nin  the  first  quarter  of  2003.  The  training  will  focus  on  management  training,  accounting,  some finance skills, and \nNPL resolution.  \n\n20  For  example,  the  possibility  is  that  a  balance  sheet  cleanup  could  create  the  perception  of  releasing  banks  and \n\nborrowers from their past loan obligations. \n\n21 Almost 70% of the pre-2000 NPLs in the SOCBs are to SOEs and/or related to government contracts.  \n22\n\n One quarter of post-2000 NPLs originating from Government arrears to private sector contractors are to be settled \namong  the  borrower,  MOF,  and  the  SOCBs,  with  the  use  of  intricate  process  of  tripartite  discussion, \ndocumentation, and review.  \n\n\f \n\n11  \n\n \nAs  most pre-2000 NPLs are loans to SOEs, and government arrears to contractors or \n50. \nare  the  result  of  directed  lending,  the  Government  will  compensate  the  SOCBs  for  pre-2000 \nNPLs  through  a  conditional  and  phased  issuance  of  nontransferable,  nondiscountable \ngovernment securities to the banks, following third-party verification of the SOCBs meeting the \noperational performance targets. The bond injections will take place in four tranches of KN120 \nbillion each: at the beginning of the program (around March 2003), after the first midterm review \n(prior to October 2003), and after the two end-year performance reviews before May 2004 and \nMay 2005.23  \n \n51. \nTo  eventually  reach  acceptable  capital  levels,  the  SOCBs  will  prepare,  as  part  of  the \nmedium-term  strategy  for  the  banking  sector,  a  credible,  time-bound  capital  buildup  plan  to \ncomply with BOL regulations on capital adequacy in a reasonable period. Given the difficulty of \naugmenting capital through growth and retained earnings, the buildup plan will need to include \nthe search for a strategic investor or other nonpublic sources of capital. \n \n\nf. \n\nPrudential Supervision and Audits \n\n52. \nExisting prudential supervisory regulations cover the key risk activities of the banks and \ncontain sufficient sanctions for imprudent banking activities. However, significant weaknesses in \nauthority  and  technical  capacity  prevent  the  Bank  and  Financial  Supervision  Department \n(BFSD)  of  BOL  from  effectively  implementing  such  regulations.  The  weaknesses  in  bank \nsupervision  have  been  apparent  in  the  application  of  a  subset  of  prudential  regulations  which \nfocus  on  disclosure  regulations  for  presenting  financial  accounts,24 and restricting commercial \nbank activity during the restructuring period.25  \n \n53. \nEffective  enforcement  of  prudential  regulations  will  require  application  of  good  policies \nand  procedures  in  the  banks  as  well  as  vigorous  verification  of  com pliance by the supervisor. \nThe  Program  will  contribute  to  the  reporting  and  compliance  effort  from  inside  the  SOCBs  by \nstrengthening  internal  governance  procedures,  applying  formal  accounting  policies,  and \nintroducing  better  procedures  through  new  information technology (IT) systems. The Program \nwill  also  activate  BFSD\u2019s  off-site  systems  and  on-site  inspections  through  (i)  measures  for \nprudential reporting incorporated into SOCB operational policies; (ii) effective off-site reports on \nfinancial  soundness;  and  (iii)  at  least  two  yearly  examinations  of  SOCBs  to  verify  financial \nreports and qualitative performance targets.26 \n \n54. \nExternal auditors are expected to provide independent assurance on the reliability of the \ninternal systems and the annual financial reports produced by each SOCB. BOL and MOF will \nensure that the SOCBs prepare annual accounts, that the accounts are in accordance with BOL \nAccounting  Decree  No.  03,  and  are  audited  by  external  auditors.  MOF/BOL  will  require  the \nauditors  to  give  an  opinion  on  the  SOCBs\u2019  compliance  with  the  operational  policies  and  other \nactions/targets under the governance agreement. In addition to giving objective advice to MOF, \nBOL, SOCBs, and IFIs on compliance with the governance agreement, the auditors will help set \nthe program activities and performance targets for the coming year.  \n \n\n                                                 \n23\n\n  In  addition  to  NPLs  made  prior  to  2000,  the  LMB  deficiency  is  estimated  at  KN154  billion  as  part  of  the \nconsolidation plan of LXB and LMB. Since the last issuance is contingent on reconstituting the branch network and \nappointing the new branch managers, it will be released following the first half-year review.  \n\n24 Key  regulations  include  BOL/98,  which  defines  classification  methodology,  provisioning  requirements,  and \n\ntreatment of accrued interest, and BOL 3, which defines risk concentration limits.   \n\n25 Key restrictions include yearly ceilings in growth of net domestic assets of SOCBs (total SOCB credit), no net credit \n\ngrowth if NPLs are greater than 15%, and an embargo on capital expenditures, staff hiring, and dividends. \n\n26  Technical assistance to strengthen BFSD is being provided through an IMF advisor under a 2-year program that \n\nbegan in May 2002. \n\n\f12 \n\n \n\ni. \n\nii. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n2. \n\nStrengthen the Enabling Legal Environment and Judicial Oversight \n\n55. \nThe expected beneficial effect of restructuring the commercial banking sector will not be \nforthcoming  without  improvements  in  the  legal  and  judicial  system  for  enforcing  loan  and \nsecured  property  obligations.  Therefore,  as  a  key  part  of  the  objective  to  improve  corporate \ngovernance and accountability in the financial system, the Program will strengthen the legal and \njudicial support for good banking through \n \n\nstrengthening  the  understanding  and  use  of  basic  concepts  behind  credit \ndiscipline  by:  (a)  introducing  standardized  loan-  and  security-related  legal \ndocumentation, and (b) conducting a credit awareness and judicial dissemination \ncampaign;  \n\nsupporting  the  establishment  of  a  streamlined  judicial  approach  to  dealing  with \nbad  debtors  by:  (a)  introducing  a  commercial  division  in  the  court  system \ndedicated  and  trained  to  rule  on  cases  involving  debtor/creditor  disputes, with \nstreamlined  rules  and  procedures  for  reaching  and  executing  judgments;  (b) \nstrengthening  the  enforcement  framework  and  processes;  and  (c)  designing  a \nplan for resolving large debts of viable enterprises; and  \n\niii. \n\nadopting  anti-money  laundering  measures  in  recognition  of  their  importance  of \npromoting  good  governance  in  banking  to  benefit  Lao  PDR  and  the  global \ncommunity. \n\na. \n\nStandardized Loan and Security Documentation  \n\n56. \nEfficient/effective  credit  markets  rely  on  information  and  certainty  about outcomes and \nare  therefore  dependent  on  a  sound,  consistent  legal  system.  The  Program  will  support  legal \nand  regulatory  dissemination  and  active  communication  to  help  strengthen  the  credit  culture \nthrough consultation among the commercial, judicial, and financial communities of the Lao PDR. \nThis  process  has  already  begun27  and  will  continue  throughout  program  implementation. \nSecond,  the  current  loan  and  security  documentation  used  by  the  SOCBs  is  deficient  in \nresponding to the needs of the borrowers and lenders. A review will be undertaken and a set of \nstandardized,  simple  loan  and  security  contracts  will  be  developed.  Commercial  judges,  bank \nstaff,  private  legal  practitioners  and  potential  borrowers  will  be  trained  using  the  new \nstandardized documentation to ensure consistency in application and interpretation. \n \n\nb. \n\nCommercial Division of Court and Enforcement   \n\n57. \nSupport for bank restructuring and better banking in the future means ensuring that the \ncourt system is properly equipped to deal with  loan and secured property enforcement actions. \nCurrently  judges  in  the  Lao  PDR  have  limited  training  and  experience  in  commercial \ntransactions  and  associated  areas  such  as  debt  enforcement  arising  from  a  loan  transaction, \nenforcement of securities, and bankruptcy. The Program will assist in establishing a commercial \ndivision  in  the  court  system.  The  Ministry  of  Justice  (MOJ)  has  nominated  18  judges  for \nspecialized  training  in  commercial  transactions.  These  judges  will  later  adjudicate  all \ncommercial transaction cases. \n \n\n                                                 \n27 A high-level technical workshop, the first jointly hosted by BOL and MOJ, entitled Legal and Judicial Support for a \nStrong Banking Sector, was held on 20 June 2002 and disseminated the findings of the legal and judicial review \ncarried  out  under  the  project  preparatory  TA  for  the  Financial  Sector  Development  Program  (PPTA  3737).  The \nworkshop was followed by further dissemination of  the findings and recommendations of the TA during the Annual \nMeeting of the Ministry of Justice, 2-4 July, 2002.   \n\n\f \n\n13  \n\n58. \nA  special  set  of  rules  of  court  to  govern  the  conduct  of  commercial  cases  will  be \ndeveloped  to  allow  a  streamlined  process  including,  as  a  centerpiece,  limiting  the  appeals  for \ncommercial  transactions  to  the  People\u2019s  Supreme  Court.28  Mechanisms  for  enforcing \ncommercial transactions will be strengthened by giving the enforcement department/units more \npower and more effective staff to enforce the court decisions. The new judicial process will be \nreviewed regularly and revisions introduced as necessary. \n \n59. \nAs the credit culture improves from increased borrower awareness and a rising \u201ccredible \nthreat\u201d of legal action, a structured voluntary resolution system will (i) provide a less costly and \nmore  appropriate  venue  for  the  lengthy  negotiations  that  have  hindered  the  effectiveness  of \njudicial  action,  (ii)  initiate  enterprise  restructuring  for  financially  viable  private  enterprises,  and \n(iii)  provide  the  authorities  with  real  case  lessons  regarding  systematic  causes  of  credit \nindiscipline. \n \n\nc. \n\nAnti-Money Laundering  \n\n60. \nBOL  has  sent  representatives  to  observe  meetings  held  by  the  Asia  Pacific  Group  on \nMoney  Laundering.29  The  Government  recognizes  the  importance  of  combating  money \nlaundering,  and  there  is  a  rising  interest,  led  by  BOL  and  MOJ,  in  initiating  anti-money-\nlaundering  measures  in  the  Lao  PDR.  Money  laundering  is  a  major  threat  not  only  to  the \ndevelopment of a sound  financial  system,  but  also  the  well-being  of  the  global  society.  Under \nthe  1988  Vienna  Convention,  all  countries  are  required  to  set  up  comprehensive  anti-money-\nlaundering regimes. Of critical importance to the regime are measures to (i) enhance awareness \non money laundering activities both  within the  Government and  within  private  businesses,  (ii) \nestablish  the  legal  and  regulatory  basis  for  combating  money  laundering,  and  (iii)  devise \nsystems for reporting suspicious transactions. \n \n61. \nThe  BSRP  will  support  the  establishment  of  such  a  regime  in  the  Lao  PDR  through \nissuance  of  anti-money  laundering  legislation,  creation  of  a  financial  intelligence  unit  as \nprovided for by the legislation on anti-money laundering, and seeking to enter into cross-border \ninformation- sharing agreements. \n \n\n3. \n\nEnable the Private Sector to Access Credit \n\na. \n\nSecured Transactions System \n\n62. \nIt is difficult to enforce security over land and other collateral under the current financial \nand legal system. Moreover, to encourage private sector access to finance, there needs to be a \ngreater  range  of  property  over  which  security  may  be  taken.  The  Program  will  assist  in \nintroducing amendments to the Secured Transaction Law, the Decree on Lease Financing, and \nother  related  laws  to  enhance  the  enforcement  of  security;  and  in  strengthening  direct \nenforcement  process  for  lenders.  To  complement  the  legal  changes,  the  effectiveness  of  the \nsecured  transactions  system  will  be  enhanced  by  establishing  a  computerized  secured \ntransaction registry, coordinated with the land and motor vehicle registries.  \n \n\n                                                 \n28  Currently,  the  practice  of  appealing  to  the  public  prosecutor  and  even  the  National  Assembly  is  one  of  the  main \n\nreasons final judgments take so long and enforcement actions are routinely delayed.  \n\n29 The  Asia  Pacific  Group  on  Money  Laundering  was  established  in  1997  with  the  objective  of  facilitating  the \nadoption, implementation, and enforcement of internationally accepted anti-money-laundering standards as set out \nin  the  40  recommendations  of  the  Financial  Actions  Task  Force.  Currently  it  has  22  members  and  ADB  is  an \nobserver. \n\n\f14 \n\n \n\nb. \n\nFinancial Disclosure by Borrowers \n\n63. \nOne  of  the  key  causes  of  high  NPLs  in  the  SOCBs  is  lending  without  the  requisite \nanalysis to determine the capability of borrowers to repay their debt from future cash flows. The \nProgram  seeks  to  improve  credit  culture  by  ensuring  that  banks  demand  the  provision  of \nfinancial  information  as  a  condition  for  assessing  all  loan  financing  requests.  Such  a  lending \npractice  will  be  built  into  the  credit  policies  and  regulations  and  will  be  enforced  through \nquarterly  biannual  reviews  of  the  governance  agreements.  Guidance from BFSD will reinforce \nthe need for banks to require basic financial statements as part of their credit review process. \nThe resulting demand for financial reporting, coupled with training programs (envisioned under \nthe  EU  and  other  programs)  to  provide basic business skills, should encourage the growth of \nservice providers ready to support enterprises in preparing financial reports.  \n \n\n4. \n\nDevelop Rural Finance  \n\n64. \nThe Program will focus on an agenda of key policy regulatory and institutional measures \nfor developing a rural and micro finance system, including steps in realizing the Government\u2019s \ngoal  of  transforming  APB  into  a  market-oriented  rural  financial  institution  and  opening  micro \nfinance  to  a  variety  of  models  and  methodologies.  A  cluster  TA  program  consisting  of  six \nsubprojects, including diagnostics and reform of APB, has been under way since 2000 to assist \nthe Government in achieving this goal.30   \n \n\na. \n\nAPB: Policy, Regulatory, and Institutional Issues \n\n65. \nUnder the Program, APB will adopt a corporate vision that explicitly includes the goals of \nmarket  orientation  and  will  implement  a  phased  operational  and  financial  restructuring  plan \nbased  on  good  governance  principles  to  achieve  that  vision.  The  specific  details  of  the \nrestructuring plan will be developed as an outcome of the ongoing diagnostic review and audit, \nand will build on the lessons from more than a year of implementation of SOCB restructuring.  \n \n66. \nGiven  APB\u2019s  \u201cdevelopment  bank\u201d  origins,  the  principal  policy  issues  facing  its  reform \nplan include the treatment of noncommercial lending in the form of directed lending and interest \nrate subsidies. To enable APB to achieve its corporate vision, directed lending and interest rate \nsubsidies  will  be  phased  out  of  its  operations  and  good  governance  policies  will  be  applied. \nThrough the ongoing operational diagnostic, financial audit, and policy review, the Government \nwill  be  considering  the  precise  timing  of  the  phase-out  and  the  use  of  alternative  transparent \nmechanisms,  preferably  on-budget,  through  which  the  Government  can  channel  funds  for \nactivities currently financed by policy lending through APB.  \n \n67. \nAs  part  of  the  good  governance  approach  to  APB,  the  Program  will  support  a \ncontinuation  of  external  audits  for  APB  based  on  international  banking  standards  and  BOL  98 \nloan  classification.  As  a  medium-term  objective,  the  Program  will  assist  BOL,  in  consultation \nwith the IMF-supported program of bank supervision, to prepare and implement an appropriate \nregulatory  framework  for  prudential  supervision  of  APB  in  line  with  its  new  mandate  of \ncommercial operations and market orientation.  \n \n\nb. \n\nMicro Finance: Policy, Regulatory, and Institutional Issues \n\n68. \nThe Government will adopt an overall vision for the sector and a strategy to support that \nvision. A rural and micro finance committee is preparing a vision statement for rural and micro \nfinance, and a time-bound action plan to remove the impediments to that vision as part of the \nGovernment\u2019s strategic planning for financial sector development. From this ongoing work, BOL \n\n                                                 \n30 ADB. 2000. Rural Finance Development (TA Cluster). Manila.  \n\n\f \n\n15  \n\nwill prepare, adopt, and implement an appropriate regulatory framework for microfinance credit \nunions  and  other  models  to  encourage  efficient  intermediation  of  small  savers\u2019  depositors.  To \nfoster growth in the rural and micro finance sector, this framework will (i) allow a variety of MFI \nmodels, (ii) foster interest rate autonomy, and (iii) encourage private ownership.  \n \nImproved  capacity  for  servicing  various  customer  types  and  diversified  lending \n69. \nmethodologies are also anticipated program outcomes.  The dissemination of lessons from this \nexperience  will  help  the  Government,  practitioners,  potential  investors,  contributors  and  other \nstakeholders form best practice approaches to rural and micro finance. \n \n\n5. \n\nStrategic Planning  \n\n70. \nThe Government priorities for the financial sector align with four of the seven focus areas \nin  ADB\u2019s  current  country  strategy  for  the  Lao  PDR:  (i)  governance  and  capacity  building,  (ii) \nrural  development  and  market  linkages,  (iii)  human  resource  development,  and  (iv)  PSD.  The \nstrategy was formulated for the phase of financial sector development being implemented with \nthe preparation of the Financial Sector Note, and continued through a participatory approach to \ndefining  the  Government\u2019s  vision  for  the  financial  sector.  Strategic  development  began  in \nearnest  with  the  four  building  blocks  underpinning  the  BSRP:  (i)  strategic  framework  for  bank \nrestructuring,31 (ii) the awareness building project for rural and micro finance,32  (iii) the review of \nlegal  and  judicial  enforcement,  and  (iv)  review  of  policy-based  impediments  to  PSD.33    The \nGovernment\u2019s next phase of strategy development (covering 2006\u20132010) for the sector will be \nsupported under the Program by adopting a financial sector strategy and action plan covering (i) \npost-restructuring banking; (ii) rural and micro finance based on the action plans currently under \ndevelopment;  and  (iii)  other  subsectors  such  as  leasing,  insurance,  pensions,  and  private \nenterprise development. \n \nC. \n\nImportant Features \n\n1. \n\nGovernance Agreement and International Banking Advisors \n\n71. \nIn  the  absence  of  the  incentives  inherent  in  a  competitive,  market-oriented economy, \nbuilding  corporate  governance  is  a  difficult  challenge.  Without  the  possibility  of  privatization  in \nthe  near  term  to  strengthen  corporate  discipline,  the  Program  takes  the  middle  road  by \ncombining  in-house  advisors  with  an  administratively  applied  performance  framework.  The \nProgram recognizes that the Lao PDR is a relatively young economy, retains a legacy of state \nownership  and  policy  direction  of  resources,  and  has  a  mixed  record  of  implementing \ncommercial  principles  in  daily  business.  To  support  implementation  of  corporate  discipline, \nindividual  accountability,  and  the  application of commercial law, the Program design utilizes a \ncombination  of  the  governance  agreement  to  provide  a  framework  for  performance-based \nincentives  and  on-site  resident  IBAs  to  ensure  SOCB  management  capacity.  The  approach  is \ndescribed in more detail in Supplementary Appendix B. \n \n72. \nThe  governance  agreements  (Supplementary  Appendix  C)  provides  (i)  a  road  map  for \nrestructuring by defining financial and operational targets, (ii) a business plan for reaching those \ntargets, (iii) a performance measurement system, (iv) objective reviews by international auditors, \nand  (v)  a  BOL/MOF  requirement  to  impose  corrective  action  in  the  case  of  unfavorable \noutcomes. BOL will be responsible for ensuring that SOCBs achieve strict compliance with the \n                                                 \n31 ADB. 2000.

Diagnostics  of  the \nenvironment  for  loan  collection  and  PSD  were  developed,  disseminated,  and  reviewed  through  a  series  of \nworkshops in March, May, and June 2002. \n\n\f16 \n\n \n\ngovernance  agreements  and  will  take  the  lead  in  applying  sanctioned  rewards  or  penalties. \nWorking  inside  the  banks,  two  IBAs  will  carry  out  the  sensitive  role  of  coaching  and  teaching \ntheir Lao counterparts while introducing and overseeing the implementation of new governance \npolicies  and  procedures.  The  IBAs  will  consult  BOL,  MOF,  and  the  IFIs  regularly  to  solve  the \nmany complex issues that will inevitably arise in this new and ambitious task. The Government \nrecognizes the importance and sensitivity of exposing international expertise to the SOCBs and \nhas requested a TA loan specifically for this purpose. The governance agreement and the IBAs\u2019 \nTOR are designed with flexibility to mitigate uncertainties inherent in this type of performance-\noriented  reform  program.  As  the  performance  of  the  SOCB  management  and  the  IBAs  will  be \nfrequently  evaluated  by  BOL,  MOF,  and  IFIs,  yearly  business  plans  and  recalibrated \nperformance targets will reflect lessons learned during the restructuring period. \n \n\n2. \n\nSocial Impact Issues   \n\n73. \nAn  important  concern  of  the  Government  and  IFIs  is  the  possible  social  impact  on \nSOCBs  staff  during  the  restructuring  process.  BOL,  in  consultation  with  all  stakeholders,  is \npreparing  a  set  of  actions  to  alleviate  tensions  and  anxieties  among  employees  during  the \nprocess  of  restructuring.  With  the  assistance  of  international  specialists,  BOL  and  the  SOCBs \nwill  introduce  (i)  a  methodology,  conditions,  and  timing  for  redeployment  and  possible \nretrenchment of SOCB staff; (ii) a consultation process; (ii) an  assistance package for staff as \nprovided  under  the  law;  (iii)  access  to  existing  and  future  redeployment  services;  and  (iv) \nmonitoring of retrenched workers. Although the SOCB restructuring may provide the first case of \nretrenching workers, SOE reform and  other  restructurings  will  pose  similar  challenges  to  the \nGovernment. Continued consultation with a wide range of stakeholders during program design, \ncoupled  with \nthe  delicate  balance  between  expediency  and  social  concerns  during \nimplementation will be the guiding principles of the cautious but proactive approach.  \n \nD. \n\nFinancing Plan  \n\nThe  Government  has  requested  a  loan  of  $15  million  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds \n74. \nresources  to  help  finance  the  Program.  The  loan  will  have  a  repayment  period  of  24  years, \nincluding a grace period of 8 years. An interest rate of 1% per annum will be charged during the \ngrace  period  and  1.5%  per  annum  thereafter.  The  total  loan  amount  was  determined  through \nADB\u2019s continued dialogue with the Government. It takes into account the strategic importance of \ndeveloping  the  financial  sector,  the  depth  and  scope  of  the  proposed  policy  reforms,  and  the \nestimated short- and medium-term adjustment costs associated with adopting the policy matrix. \nThese  costs  are  substantial  (estimated  at  $36  million  to  $43  million  equivalent)  for  the  36 \nmonths of program implementation and will comprise the following:  \n \n\nHigher  fiscal  costs  for  interest  on  bonds  ranging  from  $18  million  to  $20  million \nover 3 years for the two SOCBs and APB; 34 \n\nCosts  associated with compensating and redeploying for displaced workers ($1 \nmillion-$2 million);  \n\nBank consolidation including disposing of unused assets and bank rationalization \n($9 million-$10 million); \n\nAdopting  and  enforcing  higher  governance  standards  (policies  and  procedures, \nIT systems, higher disclosure) on banks through the governance agreements ($3 \nmillion-$4 million); \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n                                                 \n34 Though principal payments may be due in future years should performance improve, these bonds will in the short \n\nrun, not be transferable nor discountable, so their face value is not included in the adjustment costs .  \n\n \n\n\f \n\n17  \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nDetailed  external  audits  of  the  SOCBs  and  APB  to  ensure  compliance  with  the \ngovernance  agreements,  including  staff  costs  to  the  SOCBs  and  APB  for \npreparing to and engaging auditors ($1 million- $2 million); \n\nCost of setting up the commercial court and dedicating judges, an enforcement \ndepartment  and  enforcement  officers,  and  establishing  a  secured  registry  ($0.5 \nmillion-$1 million); and \n\n(vii)  APB  restructuring  and  alternative  financing  mechanism  for  policy  lending \n\n($3.5million-$5 million). \n\n \n75. \nAs the costs are mostly fiscal, the impact on the budget of the restructuring program is \nprovided  for  in  the  agreed-upon  medium  term  fiscal  framework  (Supplementary  Appendix  D) \nbeing  supported  through  additional  financing  under  the  IMF\u2019s  PRGF  and  the  World  Bank\u2019s \nFMAC.  \n \nE. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n1. \n\nProgram Management  \n\n \n\n76. \nAs  the  Executing  Agency  for  the  program  loan,  BOL  will  have  overall  responsibility for \nensuring  timely  program  implementation  and  reporting  to  ADB  on  progress  made,  problems \nencountered,  remedial  actions  taken  during  the  previous  quarter,  and  proposed  program \nactivities during the next quarter. Implementing agencies will include BOL,  MOJ, MOF and the \nSOCBs, which will be responsible for effective day-to-day implementation of their components. \nMOF will be responsible for monitoring the use of the loan proceeds.  \n \nTo  carry  out  its  role,  BOL  will  establish  a  bank  restructuring implementation committee \n77. \n(BRIC),  chaired  by \nto  oversee  program \nthe  deputy  governor  of  BOL,  empowered \nimplementation  for  both  the  program  loan  and  all  associated  technical  assistance,  and  ensure \nthat  the  proposed  reforms  are  undertaken  in  accordance  with  the  agreed-upon timetable. To \nmaintain  continuity  throughout  implementation,  the  BRIC  will  initially  include  the  director  and \ndeputy  director  officials  in  charge  of  designing  the  Program,  including  the  chairs  of  the  Bank \nRestructuring  Committee,  NPL  Committee,  Human  Resource  Committee,  IT  Committee\u2013and \nwill  include  the  BOL  legal  advisor  as  needed.  The  BRIC  will  work  closely  with  (i)  other  key \ndepartments  in  BOL,  such  as  BFSD  and  Internal  Audit;  (ii)  representatives  in  other \nimplementing agencies involved in  BSRP; (iii) ministries with interest in such as the Ministry of \nLabor and Social Welfare and the Ministry of Security; and (iv) other relevant committees such \nas the Rural Finance TA steering committee, the rural and micro finance policy committee, and \nthe prospective program management unit of the EU Bank Training Project. The BRIC will meet \nat  least  quarterly  to  review  progress  reports  and  guide  program  implementation.  Appendix  5 \ndepicts the implementation arrangements for the BSRP loan. \n \n78. \nA  program  implementation  unit  (PIU)  will  be  the  working  secretariat  of  the  BRIC.  The \nPIU  will  (i)  coordinate  the  implementation  of  the  banking  components  of  the  BSRP  loan,  (ii) \ncarry  out  administrative  and  fiduciary  support  for  the  MOJ-implemented  judicial  strengthening \ncomponent, (iii) support the BRIC and MOF in reporting on the progress of the program and use \nof the funds, (iv) organize all procurement and recruitment of consultants for the associated TA \nloan,35  and  (v)  report  to  ADB  and  other  IFIs  on  Program  implementation.  To  assist  in  building \nimplementation  capacity  and  policy  development,  the  BRIC  and  its  working  secretariat  will  be \nsupported with technical assistance during the first half of the program period.  \n \n\n                                                 \n35  Temporarily,  staff  from  BOL\u2019s  Economic  and  Research  Department,  with  the  assistance  of  ADB,  is  carrying  out \n\nadvanced recruitment action for the IBAs. \n\n\f18 \n\n \n\n2. \n\nProcurement and Disbursement  \n\n79. \nThe loan will finance the full foreign exchange costs, excluding local duties and taxes, of \nimports procured in and from ADB\u2019s member countries, other than those specified in the list of \nineligible items (Appendix 6) and those items financed by other multilateral and bilateral official \nsources. Eligible items under ADB\u2019s loan will be procured using normal commercial practices by \nthe  private  sector  or  standard  Government  procurement  procedures  acceptable  to  ADB  for \nprocurement by the public sector. Goods commonly traded on international commodity markets \nwill be procured in accordance with procedures appropriate to the trade and acceptable to ADB.  \n \n80. \nThe  loan  is  expected  to  be  utilized  over  48  months  from  loan  effectiveness.  The \nproceeds may be used  to  finance  eligible  imports  for  the  period  starting  180  days  before  loan \neffectiveness. On the basis of ADB\u2019s simplified procedures for disbursing program loans,36 the \nBorrower will be required to submit with each withdrawal request, a certification confirming the \nBorrower\u2019s  compliance  with  the  following  formula  for  the  period  covered  by  the  withdrawal \nrequest:  for  each  year  in  which  the  proceeds  are  expected  to  be  disbursed,  the  value  of  the \ncountry\u2019s  total  imports  minus  (i)  imports  from  nonmember  countries, (ii) ineligible imports, and \n(iii) imports financed under other official development agencies. This amount must be equal to \nor greater than the amounts expected to be disbursed during the year. ADB will have the right to \naudit the use of the loan proceeds and to verify the accuracy of the Borrower\u2019s certification. \n \n\n3. \n\nCounterpart Funds \n\nThe  Government  will  use  counterpart  funds  to  finance  the  local  currency  costs  of \n\n81. \nimplementing the Program and other activities consistent with the objectives the Program. \n \n\n4. \n\nMonitoring  \n\n82. \nThe  Government  and  ADB  will  continue  active  policy  dialogue  throughout  BSRP \nimplementation  on  matters  relating  to  banking  and  financial  sector  development.  In  particular, \nADB will closely monitor the implementation and impact of the banking sector reforms covering \nfinancial  governance  and  potential  staff  retrenchment.  ADB  will  give  close  attention  to  the \npoverty impact of policy reforms and adjustment costs. \n \n83. \nThe  PIU  will  coordinate  the  delivery  of  the  various reports from the SOCBs, the BOL \nBFSD,  MOF  and  MOJ.  The  PIU  will  also  submit  a  consolidated  report  to  ADB  on  a  quarterly \nbasis covering BSRP implementation, particularly policy actions set out in the policy matrix and \ndevelopment policy letter, and on the accomplishment of the BSRP loan objectives. The reports \nwill be submitted in such form and in such detail and within such period as ADB may request, \nand should include, (i) progress made and problems encountered during the month or quarter in \nreview,  (ii)  steps  taken  or  proposed  to  be  taken  to  remedy  problems  encountered,  (iii)  the \nproposed detailed activity for BSRP implementation, and (iv) expected progress during the next \n3 months. If retrenchment is proposed for bank staff during the restructuring of the SOCBs, BOL \nwill report what was done under the agreed-upon retrenchment and mitigation plans. In addition, \nBOL  will  ensure  that  the  SOCBs  have  their  accounts  audited  annually  by  independent  and \ncompetent auditors acceptable to ADB, with signed audits submitted to ADB within 6 months of \nthe end of the calendar year. At the minimum, audited financial statements will be in English and \nwill include income and expenditures, assets and liabilities, with the accompanying notes to the \naccounts.  \n \n\n                                                 \n36  ADB.  1998.

The  PIU  will  develop  a \ncomprehensive monitoring system including the establishment of benchmarks, data collection, \nand analysis. Impacts to be measured are (i) the level of NPL resolution, with attention to cases \nheard by the commercial division; (ii) the enhanced good governance practices in the SOCBs; \n(iii) improved cost structures of the SOCBs with attention to the  quality of credit analysis; and  \n(iv)  more  accurate  financial  reporting  and  controls.  The  PIU  will  submit  a  plan  for  monitoring \nprogram performance and preparing benchmark information for ADB\u2019s review and concurrence \nwithin 6 months of loan effectiveness. \n \n85. \nADB  will  send  regular  review  missions  to  assess  compliance  with  the  program \nrequirements  in  general  and  with  operational  policies  and  performance  targets  under  the \ngovernance  agreements  in  particular.  The  missions  will  also  review  actions  to  ensure  that \nprogram implementation remains on course. Within 2 years of the Program\u2019s start, ADB and the \nGovernment  will  jointly  undertake  a  comprehensive  midterm  review  to  formulate  within  the \nupdated  sector  setting  and  other  changing  circumstances  the  necessary courses of action for \nthe Government and ADB to ensure program implementation. Not later than 3 months from the \nmidterm review and the completion of BSRP, the Government will prepare and furnish to ADB a \ncomprehensive report on the overall impact of the policy reforms implemented. The Government \nwill  make  the  necessary  information  available  to  enable  ADB  to  conduct  reviews  to  ascertain \nthat  the  policies  are  being  implemented  and  will  keep  ADB  informed  of  outcomes  of  policy \ndiscussions that have implications for BSRP implementation. \n \n\n5. \n\nImplementation Period and Tranching \n\nThe loan as proposed will cover an implementation period of 3 years and consist of three \n86. \ntranches  that  will  be  disbursed  when  ADB  is  assured  that  the  conditions  for  release  are \nsatisfied.  The  first  tranche  of  $5  million  will  be  made  available  following  loan  effectiveness. \nSubject to the Government\u2019s compliance with conditions, it is envisaged that the second tranche \nof  $5  million  will  be  disbursed  within  19  months  after  release  of  the  first  tranche.  The  third \ntranche  of  $5  million  is  expected  to  be  disbursed  within  15  months  after  the  second  tranche, \nupon the Government's compliance with conditions. About 3 months before scheduled tranche \nrelease, ADB with the Government will review progress in implementing specified policy actions \nset out in the policy matrix.

The TA \nwill assist the Government to implement key activities covered by the BSRP policy agenda:  \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nStrengthen  Government  oversight  and  monitoring  capabilities \nrestructuring  and  NPL  resolution  with  advisory  services \nfor \npostrestructuring strategy; \n\nfor  bank \nformulating \n\nAssist SOCBs develop and implement NPL resolution strategies; \n\nEstablish  the  commercial  division  of  the  court  and  strengthen  the  legislative \nframework for commercial transactions; and \n\nAssist  in  refining  a  new  banking  legislative  framework  including  anti-money \nlaundering legislation and surveillance system. \n\n \n\n88. \nThe  TA  will  begin  in  January  2003  and  will  be  implemented  over  36  months  ending \nDecember  2005.  A  total  of  23  person-months  of  international  and  30  months  of  domestic \nconsulting services will be required. The TA costs a total of $900,000: $750,000 from the ADB \nTA Special Fund and $150,000 from the Canadian Governance Fund to cover judicial training. \nThe  consultants  will  have  expertise  in  bank  restructuring,  management  and  resolution  of \nproblem  loans,  human  resource  development,  and  commercial  and  banking-related law. They \nwill  be  recruited  individually  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants, \nusing the simplified technical proposal procedures. All equipment will be procured in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. A full description, outline Terms of Reference and cost \nestimates are in Appendix 7.  \n \n89. \nAs  the  Executing  Agency  for  the  TA,  BOL  will  provide  the  necessary  qualified \ncounterpart staff and office space for the consultants. The implementation arrangements will be \nthe same as those for BSRP loan. A senior official from the BRIC will be appointed to serve as \nTA project manager and will be supported by the PIU. The BRIC will meet at least quarterly to \nreview and guide implementation \n \n\n\f \n\n21  \n\nB. \n\nRelated Technical Assistance \n\n1. \n\nTechnical Assistance Loan \n\n90. \nA TA loan of $4 million to accompany the BSRP loan has been  circulated to the Board \non  24  October  2002.  This  assists  SOCBs\u2019  management  achieve  the  operational  and  financial \nrestructuring  objectives  under  the  governance  agreement.  The  TA  loan  will  finance  (i)  IBAs  in \neach of the two SOCBs for a period of 3 years, supplemented by technical experts to introduce \nspecific  banking  modules;  (ii)  IT  systems  for  the  SOCBs  to  support  the  transparency  and \nefficiency goals of the program. BOL has begun advance recruitment action for the IBAs.  \n \n91. \nThe  goal  of  the  TA  loan  is  measurable  and  meaningful  change  in  the  way  the  SOCBs \nconduct  their  daily  business.  IBAs  financed  under  the  TA  will  assist  the  SOCBs  in  (i) \nimplementing  a  multifaceted  program  of  institutional  and  financial  restructuring,  (ii)  achieving \nmajor  efficiency  and  cost  improvements,  (iii)  NPL  resolution  through  focus  on  recovery  of \ncurrent NPLs in the portfolio, (iv) ensuring that new flows of credit are of higher quality than in \nthe  past,  and  (v)  introducing  a  client  and  business  orientation  in  banking  relationships, \nparticularly when it comes to assisting SMEs to present bankable projects. \n \n\n2. \n\nOther ADB-Financed Technical Assistance  \n\nThe BSRP loan activities are supported by ongoing and planned TA covering rural and \n92. \nmicro  finance  and  the  secured  transactions  system.  In  the  case  of  rural  finance,  the  current \npolicy  discussion  is  the  outcome  of  awareness  building  and  policy  reviews  carried  out  under \nsub-project  1  of  a  cluster  TA  for  rural  and  micro  finance.37  Subproject  2  is  supporting  the \ndiagnostic,  audit,  and  restructuring  planning  for  APB.  Other  subprojects  will  be  designed  to \nsupport  strategy  formulation,  reforms  in  APB,  savings  and  credit  unions,  and  the  regulatory \nframework  for  rural  and  micro  finance.  Access  to  finance  will  be  facilitated  through a working \nsecured  transactions  framework  and  computerized  registry,  and  will  be  supported  through  a \nprivate sector development TA in 2003.   \n \n\nVI. \n\nPROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS  \n\nA. \n\nBenefits and Impacts  \n\n93. \nThe  current  financial  sector  reveals  substantial  potential  for  developing  and  expanding \nfinance  for  private  sector  led  growth  and  rural  financial  services  for  poverty  reduction.  The \npoverty  impact  is  analyzed  in  Appendix  8.  The  first  step  is  to  establish  a  sound  commercial \nfooting  whereby  good  projects  will  be  funded  and  poor  ones  will  be  terminated.  The  principle \nbehind BSRP is to strictly apply and enforce the commercial framework, thereby fostering good \ngovernance  behavior  throughout  the  fledgling  financial  system.  This  will  result  in  greater \ncertainty  and  predictability  in  all  commercial  transactions,  particularly  in  enforcing  loan  and \nsecurity  obligations.  Such  a  change  in  the  environment  for  commercial  transactions  will  allow \ncommercial  banks,  foreign  and  domestic,  to  lend  to  a  wider  range  of  borrowers.  The \nmarket  discipline  embodied  in  the  Program  will  build  institutions  that  compare  favorably  with \nneighboring  countries  and  provide  the  enabling  environment  for  domestic  private-sector-led \ngrowth and foreign direct investment. \n \n94. \nA second more immediate and urgent benefit is support for macroeconomic stability. The \nGovernment is painfully aware of the cost (around 1.3% of GDP every 2 years) to the economy \nand  to  the  Government  budget  resulting  from  the  expensive  process  of  restructuring  state \nbanks.  The  Program  will  strengthen  the  country\u2019s  ability  to  grow  without  the  attendant  risk  of \n\n                                                 \n37 ADB 2000.

Moreover, as the Government reorients its expenditure framework to ensure a \nhigher priority to social expenditures to reduce poverty, fiscal resources gained over the medium \nterm  will  allow  the  Government  to  reorient  its  role  away  from  directing  commercial  resources \nand toward allocating resources to the social sector.  \n \nAs 90% of the country is outside the urban areas as are the majority of the poor in the \n95. \nLao  PDR,  a  third  benefit  is  the  emergence  of  a  sound  sustainable  outreach  by  the  financial \nsector through a variety of models and methodologies. In the longer term, a rural finance sector \nthat is integrated into the overall banking infrastructure will yield significant benefits by moving \nliquidity around the country.  \n \n96. \nA particularly important long-term benefit is the capacity that the Program is building in a \nset of bankers, judges, and policy makers for the future development of the commercial system. \nThe  intensity  of  on-the-job  restructuring  work,  coupled  with  simultaneous  formal  and  informal \ntraining will produce stronger participants for future commercial development.  \n \nB. \n\nRisks \n\nThe  risks  in  the  Program  are  significant,  but  manageable.  Given  the  steps  to  mitigate \n\n97. \nthose risks, the integrated benefits and impacts are expected to outweigh the costs.  \n \nAs  the  Program  is  based  on  the  assumption  of  a  stable  macroeconomic  environment, \n98. \nany  violation  of  this  could  adversely  affect  the  financial  performance  of  the  SOCBs.  The \nmacroeconomic risk is being minimized through the monitored fiscal and monetary framework \nunder the IMF\u2019s PRGF, attention to better financial reporting and limits to credit expansion under \nthe  World  Bank\u2019s  FMAC,  and  the  emphasis  on  sound  banking,  financial  disclosure,  and \nperformance monitoring under the proposed BSRP. \n \n99. \nA  second  risk  concerns  the  ability  and  will  of  the  Government  to  implement  the  broad \nreform program, given the constituencies that are against reforms, particularly in the provinces, \nand the need to sustain arduous restructuring over a long period. The risk is being mitigated by \na  continuation  in  the  year-long  program  of  ownership  building;  strong  aid  coordination  in \ndialogue and instruments; and a front-loaded, performance-based program design and flexibility \nin the underlying program parameters. The Government\u2019s commitment to carry out and sustain \nthe  range  of  reforms  under  the  Program  is  demonstrated  by  up  front  actions  of  merit  already \ntaken.  \n \n100.  A  third  risk  is  that  the  proposed  reforms  will  be  undertaken  by  ministries,  officials,  and \nbankers  that  are  relatively  inexperienced  and  lacking  in  technical  knowledge,  raising  the \npossibility  of  uneven  and  slow  implementation.    This  risk  is  addressed  through  a  significant \namount  of  TA  in  the  form  of  resident  advisors,  coupled  with  formalized  training  courses  and \nbasic training in standardized loan documents and required financial statements. In addition to \nresident  IBAs  inside  the  SOCBs,  there  will  be  resident  advisors  to  the  bank  restructuring \noversight unit and to the judiciary. The deployment of multiple advisors throughout the financial \nsystem  will  be  balanced  with  country  ownership  concerns  through care in designing TOR that \nmaintains appropriate accountability. \n \n101.  A fourth risk is that restructuring the SOCBs may result in redundancies and this could \nlead to resentment and  grassroots  resistance,  especially  in  provincial  branches.  Consultation \nand  awareness  building  have  begun  and  will  continue  throughout  implementation.  The \nGovernment,  in  consultation  with  the  stakeholders  and  as  agreed  upon  with  ADB,  has  also \ncommitted that mitigation measures will be an integral part of the restructuring program should \nthere be adverse effects on vulnerable SOCB staff.  \n \n\n\f \n\n23 \n\nVII. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \n\n102. \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n\nThe  Government  will  promptly  adopt  and  implement  the  policies  and  program \nactions  indicated  in  the  Program  as  specified  in  the  Policy  Letter,  including  the \nPolicy Matrix, in a timely manner and shall ensure that such policies and actions \nwill be sustained.  \n\nThe Government will actively assist and support ongoing program monitoring and \nevaluation  by  facilitating  consultations  with  central  and  provincial  agencies,  and \nother key stakeholders as appropriate.  \n\nThe  Government  will  keep  ADB  informed  of  policy  discussions  with  other \nstakeholders about measures to ensure effective implementation of the Program. \n\nThe  Government  will  provide  ADB  with  the  opportunity  to  comment  on  relevant \nstudies and draft laws or decrees that are likely to impact on program objectives \nand implementation. \n\nThe Government will ensure that adequate and timely funds are made available \nto  BOL  and  relevant  central  agencies  and  provincial  administrations  to  facilitate \nimplementation of the Program. \n\nThe  Government  will  use  its  best  endeavors  to  enter  anti-money  laundering \ninformation sharing and cooperation arrangements with regulatory institutions in \nthe Asian and Pacific Region. \n\nVIII.

The  Government  has  requested \nassistance1  (TA)  to  support  the  Program,  focusing  on  the  bank  restructuring  activities, \nparticularly  the  nonperforming  loan  resolution  activities,  and  strengthening  the  judicial  support \nfor good banking. \n  \nB. \n\nBackground and Rationale  \n\n2. \nTo  strengthen  SOCB  governance,  the  BSRP  loan  will  support  governance  agreements \nbetween  the  SOCBs,  BOL,  and  the  Government  to  guide,  gauge,  and  enforce  restructuring \ncommitments;  and  obtain  temporary  operational  support  from  international  banking  advisors \n(IBAs).  The  governance  agreements  will  provide  a  yearly  guide  to  the  restoration  of  SOCB \nhealth  through  operational  restructuring  and,  contingent  on  performance  improvements, \nfinancial  support.  The  IBAs  will  assist  bank  management  to  implement  the  multifaceted \nturnaround plans embodied in the restructuring program of each bank.  \n\n \n3. \nThe  BSRP  loan  will  also  support  case-by-case  resolution  of  individual  accounts  in \ndefault primarily through legislative measures and judicial support for SOCB actions to address \nborrowers  in  default.  This  will  involve  (i)  developing  a  strategy  for  the  timely  and  effective \nrecovery of NPLs, (ii) planning and implementing targets on resolution and cash collection, (iii) \narticulating  generic  issues  on  NPL  resolution,  and  (iv)  developing  and  implementing  a \ncommunications  program  to  improve  the  local  credit  culture.  The  judiciary\u2019s  support  for  NPL \nresolution  will  be  strengthened  through  improved  legislative  measures  to  strengthen  the \nenvironment  for  NPL  recovery,  establishing  the  commercial  court,  standardizing  loan  and \nsecurity  documentation,  and  implementing  a  program  to  strengthen  the  enforcement  of \ncommercial judgments.  \n \nC. \n\nThe Proposed Technical Assistance \n\n1. \n\nObjective and Scope  \n\n4. \nThe  TA  aims  for  a  strengthened  banking  sector  supported  by  a  conducive  legal \nenvironment  and  effective  judicial  processes.  It  will  assist  the  Government  to  strengthen \nshareholder  oversight  of  bank  restructuring,  including  (i)  strategy  development;  (ii)  human \nresource  (HR)  development;  (iii)  case  by  case  NPL  resolution;  and  (iv)  the  legal  and  judicial \nframework to support NPL resolution, including establishing a commercial division of the court \nand strengthening the framework for commercial transactions.  \n \n\na. \n\nOversight of SOCB Restructuring and Strategy Development  \n\n5. \nThe  performance-based  nature  of  the  program  and  its  heavy  emphasis  on  monitoring \nand  evaluation  make  restructuring  oversight  a  key  part  of  program  implementation.  Therefore, \n\n                                                 \n1 The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities in August, 2002. \n\n\fAppendix 7 \n\n49 \n\nthe Government is establishing a bank restructuring implementation committee (BRIC) chaired \nby  the  deputy  governor  of  Bank  of  Lao  PDR  (BOL)  and  charged  with  overseeing  program \nimplementation  with  special  emphasis  on  monitoring  SOCB  compliance  with  the  governance \nagreements.  To  carry  out  day-to-day  implementation  duties,  a  program  implementation  unit \n(PIU) will be attached to the BRIC.    \n \n6. \nThe  TA  will  provide  a  Bank  Restructuring  Advisor  to  assist  the  newly  formed  BRIC  to \ncarry  out  the  executing  agency  oversight  responsibilities  for  the  Program  as  a  whole,  with \nemphasis  on  ensuring  implementation  and  monitoring  of  the  plans  in  the  governance \nagreements.2  The  responsibilities  include  helping  to  build  the  capacity  to  monitor,  oversee, \nrevise, and otherwise manage the contracts with the international banking advisors; assessing \nSOCB compliance with operational performance targets;  arranging  and  ensuring  that  SOCBs \nare audited according to appropriate terms of reference (TORs) and using acceptable auditors \nand winding up former SOCBs and developing a monitoring and reporting methodology for the \nprogram.  The  bank  restructuring  advisor  will  also  assist  the  Government  to  specify  a  5-year \nstrategy for banking development after restructuring to serve as a road map in deepening and \nbroadening the banking reforms, and to expand the policy agenda.  \n \n\nb. \n\nHuman Resource Development \n\nOne of the key components of the bank restructuring plans is the plan to rationalize the \n7. \nstaff complement of the SOCBs by (i) introducing a new set of personnel and HR policies and \nprocedures, (ii) developing a program of training and scholarships for promising SOCB staff, (iii) \nensuring  that  a  system  that  matches  staff  skills  and  job  requirements  is  put  in  place,  and  (iv) \nproposing a performance reward system to introduce positive and negative incentives related to \njob  performance.  The  TA  will  provide  an  HR  specialist  to  assist  the  IBAs  early  in  the \nrestructuring program to develop the HR program for the SOCBs. Because the HR plan includes \nstaff  retrenchment,  the  TA  will  help  the  Government  develop  the  specifications  to  mitigate  the \nadverse impact on nonmanagement staff.    \n \n\nc. \n\nNPL Resolution \n\nA primary objective of the program is the case-by-case resolution of NPLs, which have \n8. \nemerged in recent years. The methods for resolving the solutions will vary and be dependent on \n(i) the type of borrower, (ii) the source of the NPL, and (iii) the future viability of the borrower. \nTherefore,  the  TA  will  assist  SOCBs  in  assessing  each  NPL  of  a  minimum  size,  developing \nindividual  strategies  for  addressing  NPLs  and  preparing  guidelines  for  SOCBs  to  use  when \nimplementing each strategy. Of particular emphasis is the role of judicial action in the cases of \nborrowers  in  default  and  the  role  of  structured  negotiations  around  a  enterprise  and  debt \nrestructuring program.   \n\n \n9. \nThe TA will focus particularly on these types of cases as demonstration and training for \nthe  principal  approach  to  NPL  in  a  private  sector  oriented  commercial  system.  The  NPL \nresolution plans being carried out inside the SOCBs will be closely coordinated with the program \nto build the judicial capacity in this area and will complement these efforts through assistance to \nSOCBs in case preparation, management and resolution. The TA will help prepare and submit \nat least 10 cases for presentation to the newly formed commercial division of the court. The TA \n\n                                                 \n2 The seven plans are, (i) organizational, (ii) operational, (iii) fixed assets rationalization, (iv) NPL recovery plan and \nbranch rationalization, (v) human resource, (vi) information technology, and (vii) financial and capital build-up plan. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f50 \n\nAppendix 7 \n\nwill  also  help  prepare  standardized  loan  and  security  documentation  and  will  assist  in \nimplementing a structured voluntary system for borrowers undergoing restructuring.  \n \n\nd. \n\nSupport for Legal and Judicial Strengthening  \n\n10. \nTo  support  the  Program\u2019s  emphasis  on  strengthening  the  involuntary  approach  to  NPL \nresolution,  the  TA  will  help  the  Government  establish  a  commercial  division  of  the  court  and \ntrain  the  officials  for  the  new  court  division.  The  TA  will  provide  a  technical  legal  advisor  to  (i) \nhelp  draft  the  necessary  rules  of  court;  (ii)  train  judges,  SOCB  personnel,  and  enforcement \nofficers  to  understand  and  apply  the  new  rules;  (iii)  establish  monitoring  and  evaluation  of \ncommercial  division  cases;  and  (iv)  conduct  campaigns  for  public  awareness  of  the  new \nprocedures  and  ensure  regular  exchange  of  information  and  consensus  building  among  the \nstakeholders, both private and public, for the judicial reform process.  \n \n11. \nThe  TA  will  also  help  the  Government  to  draft  standardized  loan  and  security \ndocumentation and ensure that the SOCBs adopt and use the model documentation. Training in \nthe  standardized  documentation  will  be  offered  to  commercial  judges,  bank  staff,  private  legal \npractitioners,  and  businesspersons.  The  TA  will  also  support  the  legislative  and  information \nrequirements to establish the anti-money-laundering system. \n \n\n2. \n\nCost Estimates and Financing Plan \n\n12. \nThe  combined  cost  of  the  TA  is  estimated  at  $1,059,000  equivalent,  comprising \n$842,000  in  foreign  exchange  and  $217,000  equivalent  in  local  currency  (Table  A8).  ADB  will \nprovide  $900,000  equivalent  to  cover  the  foreign  exchange  cost  of  $842,000  and  part  of  the \nlocal currency cost equivalent to $58,000. The TA will be financed on a grant basis from ADB's \ntechnical assistance fund (TASF) and from the ADB-managed Canadian Governance Fund. The \nGovernment  of  the  Lao  PDR  will  provide  the  balance  of  the  local  currency  cost  in  kind: \nexperienced  counterpart  staff,  office  space,  information  and  data  collection,  transportation \nassistance, and communications.  \n \n13. \nThe  TA  will  start  in  January  2003  and  will  be  implemented  over  a  36-month  period \nending  December  2006.  Consulting  services  will  comprise  53  person  months:  23  for \ninternational consultants with expertise in bank restructuring, financial sector strategy, program \nmanagement,  labor  displacement,  judicial  processes,  bad  loan  management commercial, and \nbanking-related law; and 30 for domestic research assistance. The consultants will be recruited \nas  individuals  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants,  using  the \nsimplified  technical  proposal  procedures.  All  equipment  will  be  procured  in  accordance  with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement.    \n \n\n3. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n14. \nThe Executing Agency for the TA will be BOL. The implementation arrangements will be \nthe same as those for the BSRP loan. The BRIC, assigned to oversee program implementation \nunder the BSRP loan, will also oversee TA implementation. A senior official from the BRIC will \nbe  appointed  to  serve  as  TA  project  manager  and  will  be  supported  by  the  PIU.  As  BOL and \nMinistry of Justice (MOJ) will implement the TA, the BRIC and the PIU will support the BOL and \nMOJ related activities to ensure greatest efficiency in the use of resources.  An inception report \nprepared within 4 weeks of the start of services, will give a time-bound work program together \nwith a schedule of progress reports. For each component, a draft final report will be submitted \n\n\fAppendix 7 \n\n51 \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nand a final report, incorporating the comments of the Government and ADB.

This appendix describes Lao PDR\u2019s \npoverty  profile,  analyzes  weaknesses  in  the  current  system,  and  examines  the  impact  of  the \nBSRP loan on poverty reduction. \n \nB. \n\nPoverty Profile \n\n2. \nPoverty  in  Lao  PDR,  as  in  most  neighboring  countries,  is  concentrated  in  rural  areas. \nAccording to the most recently prepared estimates for (1997/98), 22.1% of the urban population \nand 42.5% of the rural population (and 39.1% of the total population) were poor. Since 83.3% of \nthe  population  resided  in  rural  areas  in  1997/98,  these  estimates  imply  that  91%  of  the  poor \nreside in the rural areas.  \n\n \n\n3. \nWithin  the  rural  areas,  the  poor  tend  to  reside  in  relatively  remote  villages,  depend \nlargely  on  subsistence  farming  both  for  employment  and  as  a  source  of  incom e,  and  live  in \nrelatively large households with relatively high dependency burdens. Recently prepared poverty \nestimates suggest that the poor have benefited from rapid economic growth taking place before \nthe  economic  crisis  in  1997.  Overall,  the  percentage  of  the  population\u2019s  poor  declined  at  an \nannual  rate  of  3.1  between  1993  and  1998.  However,  reductions  in  poverty  have  been \ngeographically  uneven,  whereby  urban-rural  disparities  are  widening.  Thus,  while  economic \ngrowth  has  reduced  poverty  effectively  in  the  Lao  PDR,  it  has  not  done  so  uniformly.  The \nnonpoor has benefited more from economic growth than the poor, resulting in overall increases \nin  inequality.  In  particular,  owing  to  a  shallow  financial  system,  those  who  live  outside  the \nmonetized economy (i.e the rural poor) have not achieved the full benefits of economic growth. \n \nC. \n\nGovernment Focus on Poverty Reduction  \n\n 4. \nThe  diagram  below  depicts  a  standard  transmission  mechanism  between  Government \npolicy and the goal of poverty reduction.  The BSRP loan supports this transmission mechanism \nby  focusing  on  issues  affecting  macroeconomic  stability  and  economic  growth,  availability  of \nfiscal resources for poor-targeted programs, distribution of wealth, and employment creation. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f56 \n\nAppendix 8 \n\nMacroeconomic Stability and Economic Growth \n\n1. \n \n5. \nProgress  in  poverty  reduction,  and  particularly  the  achievement  of  the  Government\u2019s \nambitious  poverty  reduction  goals,  requires  a  sustained  rate  of  economic  growth  in  the  7% \nrange.  Weaknesses in the banking system hinders economic growth potential not only risks in \nmaintaining  macroeconomic  stability  but  also  limits  to  efficient  resource  allocation  as  the \nbanking system provides the key channel through which domestic savings are allocated within \nthe real economy. Currently, as the state-owned banks perform this financial intermediation role \nvery  poorly,  the  resulting  lack  of  confidence  in  the  banks  undoubtedly  reduces  domestic \nsavings,  while  the  inefficient  allocation  of  credit  among  enterprises  reduces  the  marginal \nproductivity of domestic capital, thereby contributing to slower economic growth. \n \n\nFiscal Resources \n\n2. \n \n6. \nThe  operating  losses  of  the  state-owned  banking  sector  require  increasing  levels  of \nfinancial  support  by  the  Government.  The  Government  currently  spends  relatively  small \npercentages  of  its  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  on  social  services  compared  with  other  low-\nincome  countries  in  the  region.  This  coupled  with  the  low  level  of  income  per  capita,  (about \n$330)1,  translates  into  under  funded  social  sector  requirements,  especially  in  the  case  of  the \nrural poor. Improving access of the rural poor to good-quality social services depends critically \non  the  Government\u2018s  ability  to  mobilize  the  necessary  recurrent  financing  to  support  the \neffective operation of largely aid-funded investments in rural education and health services. \n  \n\nEven Distribution of Income and Wealth \n\n3. \n \n7. \nMost  likely,  until  the  financial  services  are  more  widely  available  in  the  Lao  PDR, \neconomic growth will continue to take place with an associated deterioration in the distribution of \nincome and wealth as has been the experience in neighboring countries, such as the People\u2019s \nRepublic  of  China,  Malaysia,  Thailand,  and  Viet  Nam.  Therefore,  financial  sector  reform  is \nneeded to ensure that a broader range of the population benefits from economic growth in the \nfuture.  Had  income  inequality  remained  unchanged  during  the  five  years  preceding  the  As ian \ncrises,  the  percentage  of  the  population  living  in  poverty  would  have  declined  at  an  estimated \nannual rate of 5.2%, instead of the observed rate of 3.3%.  \n \n\nEmployment Creation \n\n4. \n \nPrivate  sector  development,  particularly  of  micro  and  small  enterprises,  is  critical  for \n8. \nachieving  the  employment  opportunities  needed  for  a  rapidly  growing  population.  Therefore, \nimproving  access  to  financial  services  for  small  and  medium  enterprises  (SME),  and  in  rural \nareas generally will support off-and on-farm productivity growth and employment creation that is \nneeded to reduce poverty. Providing opportunities for the rural poor to supplement their incomes \nwith nonfarm employment (i.e., diversifying their employment opportunities) is also  an important \npart  of  the  path  to  poverty  reduction,  particularly  as  the  rural  sector  is  often  prone  to \nunavoidable economic shocks.  \n \n\n                                                 \n1 IMF,  Lao PDR Staff Report, 2002. \n\n\fAppendix 8 \n\n57 \n\nD. \n\nBanking Sector Reform Impact Assessment \n\n9. \nThe  BSRP  loan  has  four  main  components  to  address  the  issues  brought  up  in  the \nprevious  section.  Each  component,  if  successfully  implemented,  is  expected  to  contribute  to \nfurther poverty reduction.  \n \n\n1. \n\nBank Restructuring \n\n \nBank  restructuring  is  needed  to  achieve  not only higher rates of economic growth and \n10. \nensure macroeconomic stability; it is required to ensure that the benefits of economic growth are \nshared by all segments of the population.  In particular, the improved lending performance of the \nstate-owned  banking  sector  should  increase  the  overall  productivity  of  bank  credit  in  the \nmedium  term,  leading  to  a  more  rapid  rate  of  economic  growth  and  increased  employment \nopportunities for the poor and nonpoor alike. \n \n11.   Reductions  both  in  the  state-owned  bank  operating  losses  and  in  the  amount  of  non-\nperforming loans should contribute to increased confidence in the banking system and enhance \nthe  economy\u2019s  macrostability.  Such  increased  confidence  and  enhanced  macrostability  can \nlead,  in  turn,  to  increased  domestic  savings,  increased  foreign  investment,  and  to  significantly \ndiminished pressures on the Lao currency and to a reduced risk of a fiscal and monetary crisis. \n \n \n11. \nIncreased  economic  growth  and  macroeconomic  stability  will  also  lead to increases in \ntax  revenue  that  can  be  used  to  support  poverty  reduction  investments  in  such  areas  as  rural \ninfrastructure,  education,  and  health.  More  directly,  the  improved  performance  of  the  state-\nowned banking sector should also attenuate the fiscal burden of the state-owned banking sector \nin the medium term, contributing to increased fiscal resources for poor-targeted programs.  \n \n\n2. \n\nStrengthening the Enabling Legal Environment and Judicial Oversight \n\n \n12. \nThis component of the BSRP loan will strengthen the ability of the banking sector, both \nstate-owned and private to resolve nonperforming loans. In particular, this component will make \nit  easier  for  all  banks  to  recover  assets  more  rapidly,  creating  better  discipline  in the granting \nand receiving of bank loans.  Such predictability and enforceability of loan contracts is critical in \nachieving  the  objective  of  greater  involvement  of  banks  and  eventually  other  parts  of  the \nfinancial system in the performance of the economy.  \n \n\n3. \n\nStrengthening Private Sector Access to Finance \n\n \n13. \nThis component will increase the availability of credit and other financial services to all \nparticipants  in  the  economy  and,  based  on  marginal  productivity  of  credit  (assuming  that  the \nmarginal  productivity  of  credit  is  higher  in  the  private  than  in  the  public  sector)  and  therefore \nlead to a higher rate of economic growth. The goal of broad based growth as a component of \npoverty  reductions  must  include  greater  access  to  finance  and  a  deepening  of  the  financial \nsector from a level which is one of the most shallow in the word.   \n \n\n4. \n\nRural and Micro Finance  \n\n \n14. \nCurrently, there are substantial obstacles to the development of rural finance in the Lao \nPDR.  Much  of  the  rural  population  is  poor  and  uneducated,  living  in  remote  areas,  with  few \nassets that can be used to secure loans. Among the rural poor, the demand for credit is limited \nmainly  to  finance  consumption  smoothing.  In  more  prosperous lowland rural areas, loans are \n\n \n\n \n\n\f58 \n\nAppendix 8 \n\nusually obtained from moneylenders and operations of the Agriculture Promotion Bank (APB).  \nHowever,  both  the  practice  and  coverage  of  rural  moneylenders  in  creating  an  informal  credit \nsystem coupled with APB\u2019s subsidized credit service retards rather than aids the development \nof alternative rural credit institutions. A reform of APB\u2019s mandate and procedures will contribute \nto  the  development  of  a  more  diversified  and  expanded  commercially-oriented  rural  credit \nsystem and create more participation in the formal financial sector. This should lower the cost of \nand increase the access to rural credit by borrowers currently shut out of the formal rural credit \nsystem,  thereby  contributing  to  increased  economic  growth  and  expanded  employment \nopportunities in the rural areas.  \n \nE. \n\nConclusion \n\nThe  overall  benefits  of  the  BSRP  loan  for  poverty  reduction  can  be  summarized  as \n15. \nsupporting  better  commercial  environment  for  financial  services,  particularly  intermediation \nservices which in turn would provide positive effects on the poor and nonpoor through enhanced \nmacroeconomic  stability  and  economic  growth,  employment  creation  in  the  medium  term, \nincreased fiscal space to support rural infrastructure investment and social services, and more \nequitable distribution of income and wealth. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 8 \n\n59 \n\n \n\n    Yes \n\n           Yes \n\nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY \n \nLinkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \n\nSector identified as a national priority \nin country poverty partnership agreement?  \n\nA. \nSector identified as a national \npriority in country poverty analysis? \nPoverty  in  the  Lao  People\u2019s  Democratic  Republic  (PDR),  as  in  most  neighboring  countries,  is  concentrated  in  the \nrural  areas.  According  to  the  most  recently  prepared  estimates  for  1997-98,1  22.1%  of  the  urban  population  and \n42.5% of the rural population (and 39.1% of the total population) were poor. Since 83.3% of the population resided in \nrural areas in 1997-98, these estimates imply that 91% of the poor reside in the rural areas. Within the rural areas, \nthe  poor  reside  in  relatively  remote  villages,  tend  to  be  illiterate  or  poorly  educated,  own  or  have  access  to  limited \nland and other assets, depend largely on subsistence farming both for employment and as a source of income, and \nlive in relatively large households with relatively high dependency burdens. \n \nRecently prepared poverty estimates suggest that the poor have benefited from rapid economic growth taking place \nbefore the economic crises in 1997. Overall, the poor population declined at an annual rate of 3.1% between 1993 \nand  1998.  However,  reductions  in  poverty  have  been  geographically  uneven,  while  urban-rural  disparities  are \nwidening. Thus, while economic growth has reduced poverty effectively in the Lao PDR it has not done so uniformly \nor equitably. The non-poor have benefited more from economic growth than the poor; the result is overall increased \ninequality. In particular, those who live outside the monetized economy (i.e., most of the rural poor) have not been \nable to participate in the benefits of economic growth. The banking sector\u2019s contribution to poverty reduction in Lao \nPDR. \n \nIn the Lao PDR, the banking sector contributes the stability as well as the growth of the economy. As the government \ntries to reach its poverty reduction goals, economic growth needs to target a range in excess of 7%. A sound financial \nsector \u2013  in  this  case  dominated  by  the  state-owned banks  \u2013  will  be  an  indispensable  part  of  this  growth  rate,  as \ngrowth is directly linked to a deepening in the financial sector. Further, the soundness of banks reflects the general \nconfidence  level  in  the  system  and  can  provide  the  needed  price  and  exchange  stability  for  the  real  economy  to \nexpand in a sustainable and broad-based manner.     \n \nThe banking system is also an important channel through which domestic savings are allocated to support the good \nprojects  in  the  private  sector,  particularly  small  and  medium -size  enterprises  (SMEs).  Currently,  many  businesses \nsuffer  from  limited  access  to  commercial  credit,  and  the  development  of  the  private  sector  will  benefit  from  the \nincreased  availability  of  appropriately  priced  financial  products,  which  in  turn,  will  encourage  employment  creation \nassociated with the expected growth of SMEs. \n \nOn a more fundamental level, an overall effective financial system can provide services that are equally available to \nthe urban and rural population, the financially well-off, and the poor.  Expansion of the financial sector, particularly in \nthe  Lao  PDR,  is  a  key  requirement for a more equitable distribution of the benefits from rising growth rates and a \nmore robust business sector. Efforts to reach out to all regions and facilitate access to credit on commercial terms will \nbe  critical  to  narrowing  the  gap  in  the  Lao  PDR.  Improving  access  to  financial  services  will  boost  widespread \nproductivity growth and employment creation. \n \nIn  the  Lao  PDR,  there  are  five  main  channels  by  which  banking  system  reform  can  contribute  to  further  poverty \nreduction: \nMacroeconomic stability and economic growth \nFiscal space \nDistribution of income and wealth \nEmployment creation \nExtension of sustainable financial services  \n1  Nanak  Kakwani,  Gaurav  Datt,  Bounthavy  Siousphanhthong,  Phonesaly  Souksavath,  and  Limin  Wang.  2002. \n\u201cPoverty in Lao PDR During the 1990s,\u201d Revised May 31,2002.

These include banking sector reform, and the development of an enabling environment and better \ninstitutions to provide financial services to the rural sector.   \nBank restructuring \nThe improved performance of banks will produce economic growth that would far exceed the short-term adjustment \ncosts,  and  thus  provide  a  significantly  positive  impact  on  poverty  reduction.  Further,  given  the  current  lack  of \ninvestments  in  areas  such  as  rural  infrastructure,  education,  and  health,  improvement  in  bank  performance  frees \n\n \n\n \n\n\f60 \n\nAppendix 8 \n\ninvestments  in  areas  such  as  rural  infrastructure,  education,  and  health,  improvement  in  bank  performance  frees \nfiscal resources to provide a much-needed boost in the social portion of the budget  \u2013 particularly as the Government \nis  under  a  medium -term  fiscal  framework  supported  by  the  International  Monetary  Fund  Poverty  Reduction  Growth \nFacility. Lastly, increased confidence in the banking system and enhanced macrostability can be expected to lead, in \nturn,  to  a  lower  risk  premium  on  domestic  financial  assets  (lowering  the  costs  of  borrowing),  increased  domestic \nsavings, increased foreign investment, significantly diminished pressures on the Lao currency and a reduced risk of a \nfiscal and monetary crisis. \nImpact on access of the poor to finance \nWhile the poor may not benefit directly from this loan component in the short term, they are likely to receive indirect \nbenefits  as  a  result  of  higher  rates  of  broad-based economic  growth,  which  should  lead  to  more  rapid  growth  in \nemployment. In the medium term, with lower costs of financial services and price levels, the poor\u2019s access to credit \nand asset accumulation will also improve. \nImpact on rural areas  \nAlong with the inaccessibility to credit to the poor, there is also a significant urban/rural divide. Because the current \nbanking system is inefficient and biased toward urban areas, it creates substantial obstacles for the development of \nrural  finance.  Reform  in  the  banking  system  may  increase  the  supply  of  credit  to  rural  households.  The  program\u2019s \nobjective  is,  among  others,  to  develop  a  more  diversified  and  commercial-oriented rural credit system. This should \nhelp  accelerate  economic  growth  and  expand  employment  opportunities  and  thereby  improve  the  distribution  of \nincome and wealth in the rural areas. \n\nParticipation Process \n\nC. \nStakeholder  analysis  prepared:  No  specific  stakeholder  analysis  is  required  other  than  for  labor.
