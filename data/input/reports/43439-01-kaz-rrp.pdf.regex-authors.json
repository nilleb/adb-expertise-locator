I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \nmultitranche financing facility (MFF) to the Republic of Kazakhstan for the Central Asia Regional \nEconomic Cooperation (CAREC) Corridor 2 (Mangystau Oblast Sections) Investment Program \n(the investment program). The design and monitoring framework for the investment program is \nin Appendix 1. \nII.  THE INVESTMENT PROGRAM \nA.  Rationale \n2.  CAREC\u2019s Transport and Trade Facilitation Strategy (TTFS) and Action Plan1 develops \nsix  key  corridors  to  increase  the region\u2019s  connectivity  and  competitiveness.  The  strategy\u2019s \nsuccess largely depends on Kazakhstan\u2019s investments in the corridors as Kazakhstan serves as \nthe main conduit for regional trade owing to its strategic location and abundant resources. \nKazakhstan consumes $12 billion of the Action Plan\u2019s $25 billion investments for 2008\u20132017, to \nimprove 3,600 kilometers (km) of roads, 1,700 km of railways, airport, and port in its territory.2 \n3.  CAREC Corridor 2 connects the Caucasus and Mediterranean to East Asia via Central \nAsian countries.3 The investment program targets Kazakhstan's Mangystau Oblast (province) \nsections of the corridor. The adjoining road in Uzbekistan, which the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) is helping improve,4 will add impetus to regional connectivity and strengthen the viability \nof the investment program roads. \n4.  Located at the center of transport flows between Europe and Asia, and thus providing \nstrategic arteries of emerging transcontinental routes, Kazakhstan has great transit potential.  \nFew land transport routes can avoid Kazakhstan when linking north to south or east to west. \nTrade between Asia and Europe, amounting to $700 billion in 2009, is expected to reach $1 \ntrillion by 2015, of which 20% will pass through Kazakhstan. This transit traffic is forecasted to \ngenerate $1.1 billion in revenues for Kazakhstan.   \n5.  Mangystau  Oblast  is  Kazakhstan's  major  oil-  and  mineral-producing  region  on  the \neastern shore of the Caspian Sea. Aktau, Mangystau\u2019s capital, is a regional hub for transporting \nthe Caspian's bulky cargoes of oil and oil products to European and Asian countries, and for \ntransit traffic connecting the surrounding oilfield developers to other countries. Aktau is an \nintegral part of three international transport corridors\u2014Transport Corridor Europe\u2013Caucasus\u2013\nAsia, North\u2013South, and Inogate. Cargo transported across the Caspian Sea amounts to 30 \nmillion tons, of which 38% is via Aktau port. Consequently, investments have been poured in \npipelines,  shipping  services,  and  Aktau  port.  As  spillover  traffic  from  the  pipeline  and  the \ntransport of goods increase, roads become indispensable.  \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2008. CAREC Transport and Trade Facilitation Strategy and Action Plan. Manila. \n2  The action plan comprises 65 priority projects to construct or reconstruct 8,000 km of roads, 6,000 km of railways, \n7 airports, 3 ports, and 7 logistics centers. \n3  The corridor covers 3,800 km of roads, 3,900 km of railways, 3 airports, and 2 ports. It runs from Istanbul through \nPoti and Batumi in Georgia to Tianjin and Shanghai in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), through Azerbaijan, \nKazakhstan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, and the Kyrgyz Republic. The corridor includes rail and automotive ferry \nservices across the Caspian Sea to Aktau and continues through Beineu, crossing into Uzbekistan at Karakalpakya. \nThe route continues on to Bekabad, crosses into Tajikistan, and traverses back to Uzbekistan. It connects to the \nKyrgyz Republic and then enters the PRC at Yierkeshitan, before proceeding to the PRC\u2019s eastern port. \n4  ADB. 2010. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Multitranche \nFinancing Facility to the Republic of Uzbekistan for the CAREC Corridor 2 Road Investment Program. Manila. ", "2 \n6.  Kazakhstan's 93,000 km road network has 23,495 km of republican (national) roads, and \nthe rest are rural and urban roads. Increased motorization, a greater number of private road \nhauling companies, shorter transport hauls of goods, and a changing industrial and distribution \npattern have increased road freight traffic. In 2009, roads accounted for 25% of Kazakhstan's \nfreight traffic by ton-km and 85% of its passenger traffic by passenger-km. These shares are \nlikely to continue to grow in the foreseeable future.  \n7.  Kazakhstan\u2019s road sector has chronic operational and institutional bottlenecks caused \nmainly by (i) insufficient and deteriorating infrastructure, (ii) weak cost recovery, (iii) inefficient \ncross-border  procedures,  (iv)  poor  planning,  and  (v)  limited  project  development  and \nmanagement  capacity.  These  bottlenecks  raise  transport  costs  and  hamper  regional \ncooperation and integration opportunities, undercutting the country\u2019s competitiveness.5  \n8.  Much of the road network is in poor condition, as 40% of republican roads require major \nrehabilitation and proper maintenance. The feeder road network serving the rural population is \nnot fully developed. Roads on the six main international corridors are mostly paved with asphalt, \nbut their technical and operational characteristics (e.g., evenness and strength) are below \ninternational standards, with traffic exceeding allowable loads.6 As a result, the average driving \nspeed along the Transport Corridor Europe\u2013Caucasus\u2013Asia, one of the six international transit \ncorridors, is less than 20 km per hour. Combined with cross-border impediments, deteriorated \nroad infrastructure has led the country\u2019s transit traffic to fall far short.  \n9.  More than half of the road surface in Mangystau Oblast is gravel or earth, and most of \nthe paved sections are severely deteriorated and impassable. Traffic on the Akau\u2013Beineu road \nhas grown by 7% annually. Despite its strategic role as an arterial route, most of the road is in \nbad shape, as steep slopes and sharp turns limit the allowable speed. Congestion occurs daily, \nand the actual axle load of vehicles exceeds the road's design capacity. The road's inadequate \nserviceability and the consequent 12-hour travel time between Aktau and Beineu bloat transport \ncosts and restrict trade. \n10.  The investment program will reconstruct the 790 km of CAREC Corridor 2 roads in \nMangystau  Oblast. The investment program roads connect Kazakhstan to Azerbaijan, and \nEurope  through  the  Caspian  Sea  to  the  west;  to  the  Russian  Federation  to  the  north;  to \nUzbekistan  to  the  southeast;  and  to  Turkmenistan  to  the  south.  The  investment  program \neffectively responds to bottlenecks and risks, which were assessed in the road map.  \n11.  The government has adopted the 2020 Strategy for Economic Development (approved \nin February 2010) and the State Program on Accelerated Industrial-Innovative Development \n(SPAID) (approved in March 2010) to diversify the economy and promote all sectors\u2019 balanced \ndevelopments.7 To effectively support the 2020 Strategy and SPAID, the government\u2019s previous \nroad  development  plan  for  2006\u20132012  (RDP)  has  been  reshaped  and  expanded  into  the \nTransport Sector Program for 2010\u20132014 (TSP), approved by the government in July 2010. The \nTSP will develop an efficient transport system, which is integrated into the international transport \n                                                 \n5  Sector Assessment (Summary): Road Map (Appendix 2). \n6  The six main international routes are (i) Tashkent\u2013Shymkent\u2013Taraz\u2013Almaty\u2013Khorgos, (ii) Shymkent\u2013Kyzyl-Orda\u2013\nAktobe\u2013Uralsk\u2013Samara, (iii) Almaty\u2013Karagandy\u2013Astana\u2013Petropavlovsk, (iv) Astrakhan\u2013Atyrau\u2013Aktau\u2013border of \nTurkmenistan, (v) Omsk\u2013Pavlodar\u2013Semei\u2013Maikapshagai, and (vi) Astana\u2013Kostanai\u2013Chelyabinsk\u2013Ekaterinburg. \nRoutes (i) and (ii) are part of CAREC Corridor 1 and route (iv) is part of CAREC Corridor 2. \n7  Kazakhstan\u2019s previous Transport Strategy for 2006\u20132015, which supported ADB\u2019s 1st MFF for CAREC Corridor 1, \nhas been integrated into the 2020 Strategy, SPAID, and TSP.   \n ", "3 \nsystem.8  \n12.  An MFF is proposed to finance the investment program. The MFF comprises physical \ninvestments for upgrading roads and border infrastructure and facilities, as well as nonphysical \ninvestments for institutional capacity development, which includes project preparation, project \nmanagement, asset management, and border-crossing procedures. \n13.  The investment program aligns with ADB's Strategy 20209 and its country operations \nbusiness plan for 2010\u20132011, as well as CAREC\u2019s TTFS and Action Plan. It also aligns with the \nKazakhstan's 2020 Strategy, SPAID, and TSP. \n14.  The MFF is the modality of choice for the investment program as it strengthens the \npartnership  between  ADB  and  Kazakhstan  that  has  begun  with  the  CAREC  Corridor  1 \ninvestment program.10 All the conditions for its use are in place: a coherent strategy and sector \nroad  map,  policy  framework,  investment  plan,  and  financing  plan.  Other  modalities  were \nconsidered and discarded. \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n15.  The  investment  program  will  contribute  to  sustainable  economic  development  and \nregional cooperation under CAREC. The outcome will be increased transport connectivity and \nefficiency and institutional effectiveness. \nC.  Outputs \n16.  The outputs of the investment program will be (i) the reconstructed 790 km roads of \nCAREC Corridor 2 in Mangystau; (ii) strengthened capacity for planning, project management, \nand asset management; and (iii) improved cross-border infrastructure and facilities. The 790 km \nroads will include the 430 km Aktau\u2013Manasha section, the 84 km Beineu\u2013Akzhigit (Uzbekistan \nborder) section, and the 237 km Zhetybai\u2013Fetisovo section. These outputs will be achieved \nthrough two components: road development and capacity development. \n17.  Outputs for project 1, financed under trance 1, will be (i) the 200 km reconstructed \nsections (km 372.6\u2013km 514.3 and km 574\u2013km 632.3) of the Aktau\u2013Manasha road, including \nculverts and bridges, overpasses, road signs, and signal posts along dangerous spots; and (ii) \nstrengthened  project  management  and  institutional  capacity.  The  capacity-development \ncomponent under project 1 will support program management and institutional strengthening for \nthe investment program. It will include (i) construction supervision and program management; \n(ii) feasibility studies of subsequent tranche projects; and (iii) capacity development for road \nconstruction and maintenance, procurement design, contract management, the enforcement of \nenvironmental and resettlement safeguards, and border crossing activities. \n                                                 \n8  The contents of RDP (e.g., vision, strategic focus, investment projects) remain unchanged in TSP. TSP, integrating \ndevelopment plans for all subsectors (roads, railways, waterways, aviation, ports), has the additional focuses: (i) \ntransport  with high-technology, competitive and international standards; and (ii) closely driven by economic \ninterests, national security, geopolitics and businesses. \n9 ADB. 2008.

Financing Plan \n19.  To help finance the investment program, the government requested ADB up to $800 \nmillion through an MFF, comprising loans from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources (OCR). The \nMFF is anticipated to include three tranches, subject to the government's submission of the \nrelated periodic financing requests (PFRs), execution of the related loan agreements for each \ntranche, and fulfillment of terms and conditions and undertakings set forth in the framework \nfinancing agreement (FFA) to be entered into between the Borrower and ADB. The FFA has \nbeen negotiated and its signing by the government is being delayed due to the need on the part \nof the government to conduct interagency review of the negotiated FFA11 and loan agreement \nprior to their signing in accordance with the procedures prescribed by the legislation of the \nRepublic of Kazakhstan. Thus, the FFA signing is expected after the Board approval date. The \nOCR  financing  will  follow  the  ordinary  operations  loan  regulations  applicable  to  London \ninterbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based loans, subject to possible modifications under individual \nloan  agreements.  The  government  will  provide  $412  million  equivalent  as  a  counterpart \ncontribution.  \n20.  The PFR for tranche 1 under the MFF will be for a loan of $283 million from ADB\u2019s OCR \nto help finance project 1 (footnote 11). The first PFR is being presented to ADB Board of \nDirectors  with  this  report  and  the  FFA.  Interest  during  construction  will  be  paid  from  the \ngovernment\u2019s own sources. The proposed financing plan for the investment program and project \n1 is summarized in Table 2.  \n                                                 \n11  Framework Financing Agreement and Periodic Financing Request for Project 1 (Appendix 2). \n ", "5 \nTable 2: Financing Plan \nSource  Total ($ million)  % \nInvestment Program     \nAsian Development Bank  800.00  67.00 \nGovernment  412.00  33.00 \n     Total  1,212.00  100.00 \nProject 1     \nAsian Development Bank  283.00  85.00 \nGovernment  50.00  15.00 \n     Total  333.00  100.00 \nSources: Asian Development Bank and Ministry of Transport and Communications of Kazakhstan. \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n21.  The Ministry of Transport and Communications (MOTC) will be the executing agency, \nand the Committee of Roads (the Committee) in MOTC will be the implementing agency. MOTC \nwill establish a program management unit within the Committee and appoint a program director. \nThe program management unit will be structured around teams, each with a specific mandate: \ntechnical; legal; financial management and auditing; transport economics and procurement; \nmonitoring, reporting, and evaluation; safeguards; due diligence for subsequent tranches; and \nadministration. The implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 3 and described in \ndetail in a facility administration manual (FAM).12  \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nImplementation period  October 2010\u2013December 2016 \nEstimated completion date  30 June 2017 \nProject management \n(i)   Oversight body  Ministry of Finance  \n(ii)  Executing agency  Ministry of Transport and Communications \n(iii)  Key implementing agencies  Committee of Roads assisted by Mangystau Road Department \n(iv)  Program implementation unit  PMU   Staff of 12 \nProcurement  ICB  4 contracts  $271.4 million  \nConsulting services  consulting services for \n$8.8 million \nconstruction supervision  \nQCBS \nconsulting services for  \nprogram management \n$8.2 million \nconsulting services for \nIndividual \nprogram management \nAdvance contracting  Advance contracting for civil works and consulting services was \nrequested. \nDisbursement   The loan proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with ADB's \nLoan Disbursement Handbook (2007, as amended from time to \ntime) and detailed arrangements agreed upon between the \ngovernment and ADB. \nADB = Asian Development Bank, ICB = international competitive bidding, PMU = program management unit, QCBS = \nquality- and cost-based selection. \nSources: Asian Development Bank and Ministry of Transport and Communications of Kazakhstan. \n \n                                                 \n12  Facility Administration Manual (Appendix 2). \n ", "6 \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Economic and Financial \n22.  The economic evaluation concluded that the 430 km Manasha\u2013Aktau road (project 1 \nand part of project 2) are economically viable. An economic internal rate of return for the 430 km \nroad was estimated at 16.1%, with four subsections\u2019 economic internal rates of return ranging \nfrom 14.9% to 21.8%. The viability of the project rests on vehicle operating cost and time \nsavings  resulting  from  improved  road  conditions  after  the  project. 13 Sensitivity  analysis \nconfirmed its economic viability.14 \n23.  With  international  financial  institutions\u2019  efforts  toward  good  governance,  MOTC\u2019s \nfinancial management is improving. MOTC plans to establish a financial management system \nthat will include a manual of finance procedures, automatic project accounting, and training. The \nautomatic  accounting  system  will  be  used  to  implement  the  investment  program,  allowing \nproject transactions to be efficiently recorded and reported and interim financial reports to be \npromptly generated. The auditing of project financial statements will be timely. \nB.  Governance \n24.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government and MOTC. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures \nare  described  in  the  FAM.  The  government\u2019s  policies  and  procedures  regarding  financial \nmanagement, procurement, anticorruption, policy and legal, capacity, and other institutional \nissues and mechanisms have been assessed and found satisfactory. \n25.  All bidding documents for contracts under the MFF will include provisions specifying \nADB\u2019s right to audit the Committee\u2019s records and accounts related to the MFF, as well as those \nof all contractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service providers as they relate to the MFF. \nThe  government,  MOTC,  and  the  Committee  will  take  additional  measures  to  strengthen \ngovernance,  accountability,  and  transparency  under  the  MFF,  primarily  by  utilizing  direct \npayment procedures. Key measures are (i) external auditing of contracts, project accounts, and \nfinancial statements; (ii) transparent decisions on all procurement matters; and (iii) verification of \ncontractors\u2019 payment claims by supervising consultants following contract specifications. \nC.  Poverty and Social \n26.  The investment program is not a targeted intervention.15 Mangystau Oblast is developing \nrapidly. The oblast is ranked third in the country by per capita income, following Atyrau and \nAstana. About 25% of the oblast\u2019s population is poor. While residents in Aktau receive earnings \n40% higher than the oblast average, rural areas\u2019 incomes are much lower, at 30%\u201340% of the \naverage. Rural areas generally have inadequate social services (teachers, doctors, and civil \nservants), water supply, and electricity.  \n                                                 \n13 Deteriorated road conditions under the without-project scenario would have required mounting maintenance \nexpenditures to keep the roads open for traffic. Without the project, routine annual maintenance expenditures \nwould have to be higher to arrest further road deterioration and prevent the closure of the road. While gradual \npavement deterioration is also assumed under the with-project scenario, it occurs more slowly, giving rise to \nsavings in vehicle operating costs in relation to the without-project case. \n14  Economic Analysis (Appendix 2). \n15  Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (Appendix 2). \n ", "7 \n27.  In  2007,  20  cases  of  HIV  infection  were  reported  in  Mangystau  Oblast.  Road \nconstruction may increase sexually transmitted infections. The government has prepared a \nmitigation plan. Contractors will incorporate mitigation measures in their contracts for civil works. \nThe government also prepared a well-defined program maximizing awareness and preventive \nactions. \n28.  Women in Mangystau Oblast have few employment opportunities in the oil industry. \nWomen are mostly engaged in housework and caring for children and the elderly. Women\u2019s \nsalaries are usually half those of men. The ratio of wages paid to women and men ranges from \n25% in Karakiyanskiy Rayon (district) to 69% in Mangystau Rayon. In family budgets, however, \nthere is no gender inequality; incomes are equally managed by and expended on both genders. \nMost rural women are vulnerable but receive state social allowances. Factors causing their \npoverty include limited economic opportunity, low income from farming, and high engagement in \nunpaid housework. \n29.  The  investment  program  will  benefit  women  in  the  project  area  through  increased \neconomic activity such as small roadside businesses, improved living conditions, training in \nfarming  skills,  and  increased  access  to  new  products  and  services.  MOTC  ensured  that \ncontractors will not discriminate against women in employment during implementation.  \n30.  Considering the communities may be easily neglected during program execution, MOTC \nhas prepared a community and gender action plan as part of a land acquisition and resettlement \nplan (LARP) for project 1. The action plan intends to maximize direct benefits to women such as \nimproved mobility, job opportunities, and access to social services. This plan will be executed \nalong with the LARP. \nD.  Safeguards \n31.  In  line  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),  MOTC  has  prepared  an \nenvironmental assessment and review framework16 for the investment program and an initial \nenvironmental examination17 for project 1. Project 1 will not have major environmental impacts \nand is classified as environmental category B. MOTC has prepared a land acquisition and \nresettlement framework18 for the investment program and the LARP19 for project 1. Project 1 is \nclassified as involuntary resettlement category B since it does not involve major land acquisition \nor involuntary resettlement or affect ethnic minority groups. The environmental assessment and \nreview framework, land acquisition and resettlement framework, and LARP were disclosed in \nAugust 2010. Project 1 does not trigger indigenous peoples safeguards.  \nE.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n32.  Table 4 summarizes the major risks of the investment program and mitigating measures. \nThis risk profile focuses mainly on delays in implementation and road sustainability. Broader \nrisks  include  cross-border  performance  and  changed  macroeconomic  conditions.  Without \nefficient border crossing, trade costs increase and trade flows suffer. This ultimately affects the \nviability of the road corridor. The government has agreed to take action to mitigate such risks.20 \nInvestments in border crossing points are part of the investment program. This also requires \n                                                 \n16  Environmental Assessment and Review Framework (Appendix 2). \n17  Initial Environmental Examination for Project 1 (Appendix 2). \n18  Land Acquisition and Resettlement Framework (Appendix 2). \n19  Land Acquisition and Resettlement Plan for Project 1 (Appendix 2). \n20  Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (Appendix 2). \n ", "8 \ninvestment in neighboring countries and agreements to speed document clearance and cut \ncosts and travel time. \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nEffective implementation  Qualified individual consultants teaming up with the Ministry of \nTransport and Communications \nProfessional and competent project management \nFirm strategy, road map, and policy framework \nContinued institutional reform \nRoad sector sustainability  Annual road maintenance budget \nAdvisory services to review revenues and expenditures, \nmaintenance, and external quality-control system  \nSources: Asian Development Bank and Ministry of Transport and Communications of Kazakhstan. \n \nIV.
