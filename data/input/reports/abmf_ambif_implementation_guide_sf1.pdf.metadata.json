Association of Southeast \nAsian Nations (ASEAN) and the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), Japan, and the Republic \nof Korea\u2014collectively known as ASEAN+3\u2014to develop local currency bond markets and \nfacilitate regional bond market integration under the Asian Bond Markets Initiative in order \nto strengthen the resilience of the region\u2019s financial systems.\nADB is providing support to the ASEAN+3 Bond Market Forum (ABMF) by acting as the \nSecretariat. ABMF was established in 2010 with the endorsement of ASEAN+3 finance \nministers and comprises more than 100 members and experts drawn from financial \ninstitutions, central banks, and market authorities in the region. It functions as a common \nplatform to foster standardization of market practices and harmonization of regulations \nrelating to cross-border bond transactions in the region.\nThis report is an outcome of the dedicated efforts of ABMF members and experts to realize \ntheir aspirations for more integrated regional common bond markets. The ASEAN+3 \nMulti-Currency Bond Issuance Framework (AMBIF) has been designed as a common \nbond issuance framework serving as a nexus among domestic professional local currency \nbond markets in the region. AMBIF is expected to facilitate intraregional bond issuance \nand investment by creating common market practices; utilizing a common document for \nsubmission, the Single Submission Form; and highlighting transparent issuance procedures as \ndocumented in the Implementation Guidelines for each participating market. \nThanks to the efforts of the members and experts, ABMF is becoming Asia\u2019s primary forum \nfor the exchange of views between the public and private sectors on the development of \nthe region\u2019s bond markets. ABMF tackles industry challenges and continues to function \nas a regional platform to propose and implement measures toward more integrated bond \nmarkets. It is an excellent example of regional cooperation and collaboration between \nthe public and private sector for the realization of a regional good. As the Secretariat of \nABMF, ADB will continue to support the development of ASEAN+3 bond markets and to \ncoordinate among various stakeholders for regional institutional building.\nMa. Carmela D. Locsin\nDirector General\nSustainable Development and Climate Change Department", "Preface\nThis report on the implementation of the ASEAN+3 Multi-Currency Bond Issuance \nFramework (AMBIF) follows up on the proposal for AMBIF described in the Phase 2 Report \nof the ASEAN+3 Bond Market Forum (ABMF) Sub-Forum 1, published in April 2014.1\nThe implementation process proposed in this Phase 3 Report is the result of extensive \ndiscussions among ABMF members and experts, as well as significant consultations with \npotential issuers, investors, and market intermediaries. The report was written by an Asian \nDevelopment Bank team comprising Satoru Yamadera (Principal Financial Sector Specialist, \nSustainable Development and Climate Change Department), Shigehito Inukai (Consultant), \nand Matthias Schmidt (Consultant). However, this report should not be regarded as an \noutput of the team alone, but rather as a result of the collective work of ABMF members and \nexperts.\nABMF has established itself as the region\u2019s primary forum for the exchange of views between \nthe public and private sectors, and the tackling of industry challenges, and is expected to \ncontinue to function as a regional platform to propose and implement measures toward \nan efficient and increasingly common policy framework among ASEAN+3 bond markets. \nAt the same time, ABMF is also expected to integrate the efforts of the initiatives under its \nremit, and to link its overall work and output with other intraregional initiatives aimed at the \nharmonization and standardization of bond markets.\nNo part of this report represents the official views of any of the institutions that participated \nas either ABMF members or experts; the Asian Development Bank team is solely responsible \nfor the contents of the report.\nABMF Secretariat\n1  ASEAN+3 comprises the 10 members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) plus \nthe People\u2019s Republic of China, Japan, and the Republic of Korea.", "Statement from SF1 Chairs\nWe wish to express our sincere appreciation and gratitude to the members and experts of \nthe ASEAN+3 Bond Market Forum (ABMF) Sub-Forum 1 (SF1) for their dedication and \ncontinuous contributions toward implementation of the ASEAN+3 Multi-Currency Bond \nIssuance Framework (AMBIF), and by extension, to the creation of this report.\nThe application and refinement of the AMBIF Components detailed in the ABMF \nPhase 2 proposal (now AMBIF Elements) and, in particular, the shaping of the AMBIF \nimplementation approach and the individual market AMBIF Implementation Guidelines \nover the past 15 months required the relevant policy bodies, regulatory authorities, and \nmarket institutions to conduct much correspondence and conduct regular reviews of both \nthe proposed measures and draft documents. This commitment and the continued dialogue \nbetween public sector institutions and private sector firms to ensure that any approach \nis workable through market practices remain exemplary among policy initiatives in the \ndevelopment of regional bond markets.\nIn delivering this report, we are conscious that the adoption of AMBIF may require time \nand much practice. As this report is being published, the first pilot issues are underway in \nthe participating markets. ABMF, the issuers, and other market participants are expected \nto learn from these efforts, which are expected to further shape AMBIF. At the same time, \nthe markets themselves are evolving, with regulatory, listing, and registration authorities \nfine-tuning or streamlining their own bond and note issuance processes and requirements, \nboth through regular reviews and in response to AMBIF. In particular, the enclosed Single \nSubmission Form and the Implementation Guidelines are expected to become living \ndocuments.

The focus of the report is on the implementation of the ASEAN+3 Multi-Currency \nBond Issuance Framework (AMBIF) previously proposed in the ABMF SF1 Phase 2 Report, \npublished in April 2014. \nWhat Is AMBIF? \nAMBIF is an ABMI policy initiative to create a nexus among domestic professional local \ncurrency bond markets in the region to help facilitate intraregional transactions through \nstandardized bond and note issuance and investment processes. AMBIF facilitates \nintraregional bond and note issuance and investment by creating common market practices; \nutilizing a common document for submission, the Single Submission Form (SSF); and \nhighlighting transparent issuance procedures as documented in the Implementation \nGuidelines for each participating market. This is possible because AMBIF seeks to find \ncommon ground by focusing on the professional markets in the region, which have been \ndeveloped based on well-established international practices. AMBIF is expected to expand \nopportunities for issuers and investors: issuers can raise funds in local currencies in multiple \nlocations in the region more easily, and investors can invest in local currency bonds more \neasily. As ASEAN+3 economies grow through active cross-border business links and \neconomic integration, companies want to finance their operations with the same currency as \ntheir revenue streams. As ASEAN+3 economies accumulate more savings through economic \ngrowth, investors want to diversify investment opportunities to include the region\u2019s local \ncurrency assets. AMBIF is expected to support closer economic and financial linkages among \nASEAN+3 economies, thus serving the objective of ABMI to effectively channel the region\u2019s \nabundant savings toward financing its increasing investment needs.\nAMBIF Implementation\nBy utilizing the SSF, an issuer can apply for bond and note issuance(s,) or offer(s) for sale \nof bonds and notes, in multiple jurisdictions as the SSF is already recognized by the market \n2  ASEAN+3 refers to the 10 members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) plus \nthe People\u2019s Republic of China, Japan, and the Republic of Korea.\n3  Presently, the ASEAN+3 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors\u2019 Meeting.", "Executive Summary xiii\nauthorities participating in AMBIF. This reduces the costs of preparing individual submission \ndocuments as well as the preparation time needed in each market of interest. However, as \nthe actual application and use of the SSF in the approval process is not harmonized, the \nAMBIF Implementation Guidelines need to be referenced to understand the regulatory \nprocess in each market. The SSF and AMBIF Implementation Guidelines can together \nreduce the uncertainty associated with bond and note issuance in unfamiliar markets, which \nwould otherwise result in higher costs of documentation and disclosure when issuing bonds \nor notes in a new market.\nParticipating Markets\nAt this initial stage, the SSF, in conjunction with the AMBIF Implementation Guidelines, is \nexpected to be accepted in six jurisdictions in ASEAN+3: Hong Kong, China; Japan; Malaysia; \nthe Philippines; Singapore; and Thailand. The region\u2019s other markets are expected to join as \nsoon as they are ready.\nAMBIF Elements \nTo be recognized as a bond or note issued under AMBIF (AMBIF Bond), the elements in the \ntable below need to be satisfied.\nDefinition of AMBIF Elements\nAMBIF Elements Brief Description\nDomestic Settlement Bonds and notes are settled at a national CSD in ASEAN+3 \nmarkets.\nHarmonized Documents for  A common approach is of submitting information as input \nSubmission (Single Submission  for regulatory process(es) where approval or consent is \nForm) required.

For example, the governing law ", "xiv Executive Summary\nand jurisdiction for specific service provisions may be negotiated and agreed between the \nparties involved in the issuance. Another important feature is the language of documentation \nand disclosure items. It is envisaged that most ASEAN+3 markets participating in AMBIF \nwill be able to accept the use of a common document in English, though some markets may \nrequire the submission of approval-related information in their prescribed format in the local \nlanguage. These features are expected to evolve as AMBIF market practices.\nRecommendations and Next Steps\nThe objectives of many of the Phase 2 Report recommendations have been achieved in the \ncourse of Phase 3: the AMBIF Elements as key features of AMBIF were agreed upon and the \nfirst pilot AMBIF bond issuance was underway at the time this report was being compiled. \nYet, the implementation of AMBIF still needs to progress further. First, it is necessary to \nexpand the number of AMBIF participating markets. Particularly, proactive support for those \nmarkets at a very early stage of development should be provided by ABMF. Second, ABMF \nshould support the development of AMBIF market practices continuously. AMBIF is still at \na very early stage of development, and market practices related to AMBIF need to evolve as \nAMBIF bond issuances increase. In this regard, a lot of fine-tuning may be necessary, and \nthe continuous updating of the AMBIF Implementation Guidelines and SSF is expected. \nLastly, it is important to create a more conducive market environment, including more \nharmonized credit rating requirements and the definition of a default event and standardized \ndocumentation in line with global practices. Hopefully, ABMF will continue to be an avenue \nfor supporting the development of harmonized bond markets in the region.", "I\nGeneral Description of AMBIF\nIntroduction\nThe ASEAN+3 Multi-Currency Bond Issuance Framework (AMBIF) is a policy initiative \nunder the Asian Bond Markets Initiative (ABMI) to create a nexus among domestic \nprofessional bond markets in the region to help facilitate intraregional transactions through \nstandardized bond and note issuance and investment processes. \nABMI aims to develop efficient and liquid bond markets in Asia, which would enable better \nutilization of Asian savings for Asian investments. ABMI can also contribute to the mitigation \nof currency and maturity mismatches in financing, thereby promoting financial stability by \ncreating multiple channels of financing in the region.\nABMI and the ASEAN+3 Bond Market Forum (ABMF) will help to facilitate the process of \nrecycling savings within the region in a practical and efficient manner. This is expected to \ncontribute to the region\u2019s economic growth and stability, and facilitate intraregional bond \nand note issuance and investments by creating common market practices and utilizing a \ncommon document for submission, the Single Submission Form (SSF), with transparent \nissuance procedures as described in the AMBIF Implementation Guidelines for each \nparticipating market. The SSF is set to become a conduit for the future harmonization of \nthe region\u2019s domestic bond markets by applying common practices and documentation and \ndisclosure information for the benefit of all stakeholders.\nAMBIF is the result of the deliberations of ABMF Sub-Forum 1 (SF1) members and experts \nand the conduct of a series of market visits in the course of ABMF Phase 2 to determine \nthe feasibility of finding or specifying the same or similar processes and practices that could \nbecome the basis for a common bond and note issuance approach, in line with the ABMI \nmandate. AMBIF was originally defined in the ABMF SF1 Phase 2 Report published by the \nAsian Development Bank in April 2014.\nMain Features of AMBIF\nAMBIF was proposed as a regionally standardized bond issuance framework. Due to \ndifferences across the region in the level of market development, legal and regulatory \nframeworks, and market practices, it was not practical for many ASEAN+3 economies to \nimmediately consider the harmonization of various market rules and regulations. Hence, it \nwas not realistic to prescribe a fully standardized bond issuance framework for all markets. \nTherefore, AMBIF sought to find common ground among all ASEAN+3 markets. A number \nof common elements may allow the connecting of domestic bond markets across the region, \nin particular professional markets or market segments, since these are considered to be more ", "2 Implementation of the ASEAN+3 Multi-Currency Bond Issuance Framework\ncomparable across the region due to their participating institutions. It was also recognized \nthat the professional bond markets in the region have developed based on well-established \ncommon international practices; hence, AMBIF can use applicable international bond \nmarket practices as a reference. This would make AMBIF comparable to the international \nbond market to a certain degree and attract more participants to transact in ASEAN+3 \ndomestic markets (Figure 1). \nFigure 1: AMBIF as Comparable to the International Bond Market\nHomogeneous\n(Professional)\nAASSEEAANN++33  MMuullttii--CCuurrrreennccyy\nBBoonndd  IIssssuuaannccee  FFrraammeewwoorrkk International bond market\n((AAMMBBIIFF))\nDomestic bond markets\nHeterogeneous Local International\n(Retail)\nSource: ABMF SF1.\nTaking this into consideration, AMBIF ultimately seeks to connect ASEAN+3 domestic bond \nmarkets at the level of their domestic professional market segments, creating a nexus for \nthe development of ASEAN+3 bond markets. The ABMF SF1 Phase 2 report identified this \nas being possible because the principles behind the rules and regulations for professional \nmarkets are basically the same across the region (Figure 2).\nThe regional AMBIF market will comprise professional investor concepts (e.g., Qualified \nBuyers and Institutional Investors in several markets), professional market concepts (e.g., \nPrivate Placement to Accredited Investors in Thailand and the TOKYO PRO-BOND Market \nin Japan), and exempt market concepts (e.g., Exempt Transactions in the Philippines) \nthat, in their individual configurations, share common professional market features and \npractices. These common factors will be further enhanced by a harmonized approach for the \nsubmission of documentation into a market\u2019s regulatory processes, the SSF. (For more details \non the SSF, refer to the Appendix 1.)\nIn defining specific requirements for AMBIF as a concept and the SSF as a conduit, ABMF \nsought to have the participating economies agree on the minimum common requirements \nessential for issuing a bond or note aimed at professional investors, while accepting other \nexisting local rules and regulations in each market.\nAMBIF is carefully positioned not to require any changes in current regulations in the \nparticipating economies. At the same time, nothing should prevent policy bodies or \nregulatory authorities in individual markets from making any beneficial or planned \nadjustments to their regulatory framework, if they so deem necessary. ABMF SF1 proposed \nthis non-exclusion approach as part of its basic methodology in Phase 2.

Basically, AMBIF expands opportunities for issuers and investors wishing to \nfinance their operations and invest actively in the region, respectively. \nAMBIF represents an additional avenue to issue bonds and notes in domestic bond \nmarkets; this avenue does not require new market features or new skills for participants \nbut instead draws on existing features and the combined expertise of participants from \nboth international and domestic bond markets. In turn, AMBIF offers the recognition of \nthe SSF by the relevant authorities, and the single submission of common documentation \nand disclosure items across all participating markets, which should result in cost and time \nefficiencies, and the ability to reuse documentation and disclosure elements from the \ninternational bond market in tapping domestic bond markets. In short, AMBIF draws on \nexisting and well-established features to deliver benefits that were not readily available in \nand across markets previously.", "4 Implementation of the ASEAN+3 Multi-Currency Bond Issuance Framework\nThe establishment and implementation of AMBIF also coincides with a number of trends \nhighlighted in discussions with potential issuers and aims to deliver specific benefits to this \ntarget group. Issuers in ASEAN+3 economies share a growing interest in obtaining funding \nfor their existing commercial operations in their respective local currency in order to meet \noutgoing payments in a local currency while mitigating potential foreign exchange and \nregulatory risks that come with financing in a foreign currency. A diversification of funding \nthrough bank loans or lines of credit in favor of debt instrument issuance was also often \ncited in discussions. These issuers typically operate in a number of ASEAN+3 markets and \nare often keen to tap multiple markets under a common issuance program. Before AMBIF, \nan individual approach and individual submissions were required for each market. Under \nAMBIF, such issuance programs have become distinctly possible and practical.\nIt has been the experience of ABMF SF1 that the creation of AMBIF has stimulated \ndiscussion on further harmonization of the regulatory processes in domestic bond markets \nin ASEAN+3. It is the hope of the industry for mechanisms to be explored that can \ndeliver further benefits to market participants while keeping pace with general regulatory \ndevelopments and the comfort level of each market\u2019s authorities and institutions to \nstreamline such regulatory processes in anticipation of greater returns. The creation of \nAMBIF has also made stakeholders receptive to other regional initiatives, such as the \nASEAN Financial Integration Framework and cross-border linkages among central securities \ndepositories and central banks in the region. \nParticipating Markets\nTo participate in AMBIF, a market needs to have a regulatory framework that satisfies the \nrequirements defined as AMBIF Elements, which are explained in more detail in Chapter\u00a0II. \nIn short, the market authorities must recognize or accept the SSF within its regulatory \nprocess, which also normally requires acceptance or existence of the additional market \nfeatures conducive to AMBIF as detailed in Chapter III. \nAt this initial stage, the SSF (in conjunction with the AMBIF Implementation Guideline) \nis expected to be accepted in six jurisdictions in ASEAN+3: Hong Kong, China; Japan; \nMalaysia; the Philippines; Singapore; and Thailand. The Republic of Korea is expected to \njoin AMBIF as soon as regulatory changes are in place. SF1 is also communicating with the \nauthorities in the People\u2019s Republic of China, Indonesia, and Viet Nam on establishing an \nenabling environment that would allow these markets to participate in AMBIF at the earliest \nopportunity. The remaining ASEAN+3 markets are expected to join AMBIF when they are \nready.\nTable 1 gives an overview of the participating markets and some of their relevant features. \nThe individual features displayed in the table, including the purpose of a feature being \nconnected to AMBIF and the various instances of each feature across the participating \nmarkets, are explained in Chapter III.", "General Description of AMBIF 5\nTable 1: Participating AMBIF Markets with Relevant Features\nLanguage  Governing Law \nfor Common  for T&C (e.g.,  Possible \nDocument for  Law Related to  Bankruptcy and  Issuance \nPlace of Issuance Submission Settlement Dispute Resolution) Currencies\nICSD English English English USD*, JPY*, \nCNY*\nHong Kong, China English Hong Kong Hong Kong, English,  HKD, CNH, \nor agreed USD*, JPY*, \nothers\nJapan English Japanese Japanese JPY, USD*, others\ns\nt Malaysia English Malaysian Malaysian, English, or  MRY, USD*, \ne\nk\nr agreed CNH*\na\nM\nF  Philippines English Philippine Philippine, English,  PHP, USD*\nBI United States, or \nM\nagreed\nA\nSingapore English Singapore Singapore, English, or  SGD, USD*, JPY*, \nagreed CNH*, others\nThailand English Thai Thai or agreed THB, USD*, \nCNH*\nRepublic of Korea English Korean Korean KRW, USD*\nPeople\u2019s Republic of China Chinese Chinese Chinese CNY\nIndonesia Indonesian and  Indonesian Indonesian IDR\nEnglish\n* Considered foreign currencies in these markets. \nAMBIF = ASEAN+3 Multi-Currency Bond Issuance Framework, CNH = offshore Chinese renminbi, CNY = Chinese renminbi, HKD = Hong \nKong dollar, ICSD = international central securities depository, IDR = Indonesian rupiah, JPY = Japanese yen, KRW = Korean won,  \nMYR = Malaysian ringgit, PHP = Philippine peso, SGD = Singapore dollar, THB = Thai baht, T&C = terms and conditions, USD = US dollar.\nSource: ABMF SF1.", "II\nImplementation of AMBIF\nAlthough the ABMF SF1 Phase 1 Report recognized that ASEAN+3 bond markets are \nheterogeneous in many ways, it also recognized that the elements needed to establish \ncommon ground existed in domestic bond markets across the region because key legal and \noperational frameworks were already in place in many markets. The SF1 Phase 2 Report \nincluded a recommendation to focus on professional markets or market segments where \npolicies and practices are comparable due to the international nature of participants. \nBased on these findings, SF1 Phase 3 focused on the practical implementation of AMBIF \nacross as many ASEAN+3 professional bond markets as possible. For that purpose, a \nnumber of market visits were conducted to those economies that had signaled an interest \nin participating from the outset, and whose market features were considered conducive \nto AMBIF implementation without significant legislative or regulatory adjustments. The \nfindings from these market visits and subsequent discussions among ABMF members and \nexperts led to the definition of the AMBIF Elements, which effectively refined the AMBIF \nCore Components that had been proposed in Phase 2. In addition, the market environment \nrequired for the implementation of AMBIF was identified. Subsequently, this led to the \ndevelopment of the SSF and the identification of required market features and regulatory \nprocesses in the AMBIF Implementation Guidelines.\nThe Single Submission Form and AMBIF Implementation Guidelines\nABMF SF1 Phase 3 initially focused on how these common market elements could be \nnormalized in an attempt to provide a single form of input into the required regulatory \nprocesses across all participating markets.\nTo identify a common set of information for the required regulatory processes across all \nparticipating markets, a review of application forms for issuance approval, offering circulars, \ninformation memorandums, and program information formats in ASEAN+3 was conducted. \nIt was recognized that the core information to be provided to regulatory authorities was \nsimilar or comparable across markets. As a result, the SSF, which can be applied to all the \nrelevant regulatory processes for bond and note issuance across markets, was proposed.\nBy utilizing the SSF, an issuer can apply for bond and note issuance(s), or offer(s) for the sale \nof bonds and notes in multiple jurisdictions, as the SSF is already recognized by the market \nauthorities participating in AMBIF. This reduces the costs and time of preparing individual \nsubmission documents for each market of interest. A submission to multiple jurisdictions can \nbe done at the same time, or in sequence, depending on the needs of the issuer. The merits \nof the SSF are illustrated in Figure 3.", "Implementation of AMBIF 7\nFigure 3: Merits of the Single Submission Form\nIssuer  \nIssuer prepares a pplications market by market   \n \nAuthority A Authority B Authority C\nIssuer\nSingle Submission Form\nAuthority A Authority B Authority C\nSource: ABMF SF1.\nThe SSF combines information used in a number of markets. In effect, it represents the \nmaximum set of common information to be submitted to the regulatory authorities \nand market institutions for bond and note issuance, and profile listing or registration \napplication(s). However, it was also recognized that the actual application and use of the \nSSF in the approval process might not be the same among all participating markets. This \nled to the creation of the AMBIF Implementation Guidelines for each participating AMBIF \nmarket, which is a manual for (i) issuing AMBIF bonds, notes, and sukuk (Islamic bonds); \n(ii) navigating the regulatory process in each market; and (iii) applying the information and \ndisclosure requirements through the use of the SSF and other means as may be applicable \nin each market. The SSF and the AMBIF Implementation Guidelines can together reduce \nuncertainty associated with bond and note issuance in unfamiliar markets, which would \notherwise often result in higher costs of documentation and disclosure.\nSince the SSF contains a standardized set of regulatory required information, which is \nsubsequently published or disseminated by the relevant market mechanisms, the same \nlevel of information will be made available to interested parties across markets. Hence, an ", "8 Implementation of the ASEAN+3 Multi-Currency Bond Issuance Framework\ninvestor can easily access information on the issuer and the features of bonds and notes in a \ncomparable manner across markets, even if the investor may not be familiar with individual \nmarkets. By utilizing the SSF, issuers may be able to attract more investors from outside \nthe normal investor universe of a particular issue. This recognizable quality of the SSF is \nexpected to aid in the expansion of the investor base for AMBIF issuances, particularly long-\nterm institutional investors such as pension funds and mutual funds. \nThe objectives of the SSF, with respect to implementation of AMBIF across the participating \nmarkets, can be summarized as follows:\n\u2022\u2022 The SSF is a standard submission document (template) for AMBIF bond and note \nissuance(s) that is readily available for the Targeted Professional Investor Markets \n(issuance markets) in ASEAN+3 economies. \n\u2022\u2022 The SSF aims to facilitate an AMBIF bond and note issuance application to \nregulatory, listing, and registration authorities in each participating market. As such, \nthe SSF is prepared for the benefit of issuer(s) aiming to issue bonds and notes to \nprofessional investors in ASEAN+3 economies.\n\u2022\u2022 The SSF contains a common set of information and disclosure items to be \nsubmitted when applying for an AMBIF bond or note issuance in each participating \nmarket; however, this does not impact the ability of the regulatory, listing, and \nregistration authorities to request additional information or separate documents, if \ndeemed necessary, for their review and approval.\n\u2022\u2022 Within this common set of information and disclosure items in the SSF, the typical \nrequirements for each individual market\u2019s regulatory processes have been included \nand validated by the respective regulatory, listing, and registration authorities. This \nmakes the SSF easily recognizable for authorities and serves as a source of reference \nfor authorities on information requirements. This will be crucial in furthering efforts \ntoward the harmonization of regulatory processes and practices in the region\u2019s bond \nmarkets.\n\u2022\u2022 In turn, the SSF is acknowledged or recognized by all regulatory, listing, and \nregistration authorities in each participating market, even if the use or application of \nthe SSF may differ by market. At the same time, this does not exclude the possibility \nof using another form or document when applying for an AMBIF bond or note \nissuance where the relevant authorities so admit or require.\nThe AMBIF Elements\nTo be recognized as a bond or note issued under AMBIF (AMBIF Bond), certain \nrequirements called AMBIF Elements need to be satisfied. Table 2 gives a brief description of \nAMBIF Elements, with each element explained in detail thereafter.\nDomestic Settlement\nAMBIF is aimed at supporting domestic bond markets in ASEAN+3. To be recognized as a \ndomestic bond or note, an AMBIF bond or note needs to be settled at the designated central \nsecurities depository. Hence, domestic settlement needs to be a key feature of an AMBIF bond \nor note. Table 3 provides a comparative view of domestic settlement in ASEAN+3 markets.\nFrom a practical perspective, potential issuers did not voice objections to this focus on \ndomestic settlement, since their focus on fundraising is in their domestic market and existing \nsettlement arrangements are accepted. At the same time, investors who hold their portfolio ", "Implementation of AMBIF 9\nTable 2: Definition of AMBIF Elements\nAMBIF Elements Brief Description\nDomestic Settlement Bonds and notes are settled at a national CSD in ASEAN+3 \nmarkets\nHarmonized Documents for  A common approach is of submitting information as input \nSubmission (Single Submission  for regulatory process(es) where approval or consent is \nForm) required.

While international central securities depositories will not be able to offer issuer services \nin the context of AMBIF as they do in the international bond market, their ability to access \ndomestic bond markets in ASEAN+3 for the settlement and safekeeping of domestic bonds \nand notes on behalf of their clients remains unaffected.\nHarmonized Documents for Submission (Single Submission Form) \nBased on the review of application forms for issuance approval, offering circulars, \ninformation memorandums, and program information formats in ASEAN+3, the core \ninformation was similar or comparable across markets. Hence, the SSF, which can be applied \nto all of the relevant regulatory processes for bond and note issuances across markets, was \nproposed. The information contained in the SSF can be submitted to all relevant regulatory \nauthorities and market institutions for relevant approvals or consent, or used in the context \nof the submission (e.g., as a checklist) in anticipation of an AMBIF bond or note issuance.\nPotential issuer feedback collected in Phase 3 indicated this AMBIF Element as one of the \nkey considerations. Since the interest of these potential issuers encompasses a number of \nmarkets in ASEAN+3, the ability to raise common documentation and disclosure items in \na single instance and utilize them across all markets of interest was found to be compelling, \neven if circumstances for the application of the SSF may differ by market (Table 4).\nRegistration or Profile Listing in ASEAN+3 (Place of Continuous Disclosure)\nInformation on issuers, bonds, and notes needs to be disclosed continuously in ASEAN+3 \nmarkets. A registration or listing authority function to facilitate continuous disclosure is ", "10 Implementation of the ASEAN+3 Multi-Currency Bond Issuance Framework\nrequired. This can ensure the quality of disclosure and help create a well-organized market \nfor AMBIF issuances with transparency and a quality of information that differentiates \nAMBIF issuances from ordinary private placements for which information is often neither \navailable nor guaranteed. Owing to this important feature, an AMBIF secondary market is \nexpected to emerge as the number of issuances increases. \nContinuous disclosure requirements may be specified in laws or regulations and impose \nobligations on an\u00a0issuer or its principal agent(s) to provide regular financial or material \nupdates to regulators and registration and/or listing authorities, or via a trustee or bondholder \nTable 3: Comparative View of Domestic Settlement across Markets\nMarket Domestic Settlement\nAll domestic corporate bonds and notes traded OTC in the Hong Kong, China market are identified \nby the International Securities Identification Number prefix HK, and are admitted to and settled in the \nCMU, a unit of HKMA, regardless of whether they are denominated in Hong Kong dollars or a foreign \nHong Kong, \ncurrency.

The objective of the listing is to \nmake bonds and notes visible and more information available to investors via a recognized \nlisting place, particularly those investors with more restrictive mandates, such as mutual and \npension funds.

In order to alleviate the risks stemming from this double mismatch, ABMI \nadvocated the strengthening of the region\u2019s domestic bond markets. This necessitated a \nfocus on bond and note issuance in local currency, particularly the market infrastructure and \nclearing and settlement systems needed for local currency issuances. \nIn the context of AMBIF, the denomination of an issue is generally expected to be in the \ndomestic currency of each ASEAN+3 market.

At the time \nof a new listing (time of issuance) of a corporate bond or other instrument, applicants (issuers) need to \nprovide Specified Securities Information.\n \nBonds and notes listed on TPBM or issued based on the Program Information submitted to TSE are \nincluded within JSDA\u2019s Reference Statistical Prices (Yields) for OTC transactions.\nLodgement of the issuance documentation and initial disclosure items with the SC, the regulatory \nrequirement for an issuer to provide regular updates on financial information to an appointed trustee \nand via FAST, and the price determination by the Bond Pricing Agency Malaysia for all PDS and sukuk \n(Islamic bonds) issued in the Malaysian market form the basis of available disclosure for offers aimed at \nSophisticated Investors.

BMS acts as listing authority for all its listings and will take \nenforcement action in case of a breach.\nIn the Philippines, the enrollment of a bond or note with PDEx covers the listing as well as trading \nprocesses and practices for debt instruments. In contrast to an outright listing, an enrollment is for bonds \nand notes aimed at Qualified Buyers (professional investors) only and may be initiated by the issuer or \na trading participant; the party who enrolls a bond or note into PDEx, also referred to as the sponsor, is \nresponsible for the disclosure of material information as stipulated in the PDEx Listing Rules.\nAccording to PDEx Listing Rules (7.2.1), an enrollment is possible for debt instruments issued by resident \nand nonresident issuers. An enrollment of a note issuance program (e.g., medium-term note program) is \nprincipally possible, but has not yet been requested in applications to PDEx.\nThe listing or enrollment of a bond or note on PDEx does not automatically require trading. However, \nshould the issuer or sponsor of a bond or note enrolled on PDEx wish to trade the instrument, all trades \nmust be done on PDEx. According to the OTC Rules issued by the SEC in 2006, all OTC trading of debt \nPhilippines\ninstruments issued in the Philippines needs to occur on an SEC-authorized marketplace. PDEx is such an \nauthorized marketplace. Hence, the listing or enrollment is a necessary step toward ultimately trading a \nbond or note in the OTC market in the Philippines.\n \nAt the same time, PDEx also principally offers the feature of profile listing in the form of the Qualified \nBoard, which accepts enrollment (from the issuer) only for bonds or notes issued to professional investors.\n \nUnder the OTC Rules, the SEC has conferred listing authority functions on PDEx. The PDEx Listing \nRules compel the continuous disclosure of material information from issuers or sponsors of a bond or \nnote listed or enrolled on PDEx. PDEx also publishes bond pricing information, based on traded prices \nthat have to be captured by deal parties within 1 minute of deal closure, as provided under Section 16 of \nthe OTC Rules and reported in the Central Trade Reporting System within 15 minutes as provided under \nSection 16 of the OTC Rules.\nSGX offers a profile listing feature on its Wholesale Bonds market for bonds and notes aimed at \nInstitutional Investors and Accredited Investors under the provisions of the Securities and Futures Act. \nThese bonds and notes are traded OTC and listed for profiling only, typically in order to reach a specific \ninvestor universe or address the need for a listing in potential investors\u2019 mandated prudential regulations.\nPrices for OTC-traded bonds and notes are only available to the market through trading platforms and \ndata vendors. At present, there is no pricing agency in Singapore, and the registration of a bond and note \nis not applicable in Singapore.\nSingapore\nSGX prescribes applicable documentation and disclosure items for listing on the Wholesale Bonds \nmarket in its listing rules. Being the listing authority, SGX prescribes the continuous disclosure of material \ninformation by an issuer listed on the Wholesale Bonds market via its SGXNet platform, in addition to the \ninitial disclosure at the time of listing.\n \nFor all intents and purposes, the listing of a bond or note on the SGX Wholesale Bonds market fulfills the \nAMBIF Element of Registration or Profile Listing.\ncontinued on next page", "Implementation of AMBIF 15\nTable 5   continued \nMarket Registration or Profile Listing in ASEAN+3 (Place of Continuous Disclosure)\nIn the Thai market, registration is defined as the process of providing bond or note information to \nThaiBMA by issuers or their agents, which is a condition set by the Securities and Exchange Commission, \nThailand for the offering of bonds and notes in the primary market, as well as reporting trade data by \ncounterparties in the secondary (OTC) market.

In addition, Thai law mandates that ThaiBMA members capture their \nOTC bond transactions within 15 minutes of deal closure. ThaiBMA calculates and publishes reference \nprices on the basis of trade prices submitted, and collects material disclosure information. ThaiBMA also \nprovides significant transaction, volume, and general statistics on the bond market to interested parties.\nThe registration with ThaiBMA fulfills the intention of the AMBIF Element of Registration or Profile \nListing.

As ASEAN+3 economies grow and \nare integrated economically through cross-border business activities, companies want to \nfinance themselves with the same currency as their revenue streams. In addition, financial \ninstitutions are facing regulatory requirements to match their assets and liabilities. As a result, \nthey also need to expand their funding sources to reduce risks and capital requirements to \nprovide loans in different currencies.\nScope of Issuers\nAs AMBIF is aimed at supporting the development of domestic bond markets in the region \nand promoting the intraregional recycling of funds, an issuer needs to be a resident of an \nASEAN+3 market. This was seen as a prerequisite to help fulfill the ABMI mandate and \nfurther affirmed through the work of ABMF in Phase 3.\nDiscussions and consultations in the course of Phase 3 suggest that potential issuers are \nlarge corporates domiciled in ASEAN+3 markets with existing or planned commercial \noperations in participating markets. These operations range from manufacturing and sales \nand marketing to financial services such as leasing. Potential issuers may wish to access \nAMBIF participating markets through a domestic entity, a regional treasury center, the parent \ncompany, or through a combination of the above, often depending on the most practical and \ncost-effective practice of raising issuance documentation and disclosure items.\nSome markets may distinguish between resident and nonresident issuers and prescribe \nspecific regulatory processes and documentation or disclosure requirements for each type. \nOther markets do not distinguish by issuer type but instead specify distinct regulatory \nprocesses depending on the currency of denomination.

Therefore, they reflect actual professional bond market practices and are \nsuitable for inclusion in AMBIF. \nGoverning Law and Jurisdiction\nGoverning law and the jurisdiction for specific service provisions related to bond and note \nissuance has relevance for AMBIF since potential issuers may consider issuing under the \nlaws or jurisdiction of an economy or market other than the place of issuance. The choice \nof governing law or the contractual preferences of stakeholders can affect accessibility to a \nspecific investor universe that may otherwise not be accessible if a bond or note were issued \nunder the laws of the place of issuance. However, it is necessary to point out that laws related \nto bond and note issuance and settlement must be governed by the laws and regulations of \nthe place of issuance since AMBIF bonds and notes are domestic bonds and notes.\nFrom a practical perspective, the governing law and jurisdiction of a bond or note issuance \nare determined by negotiations and an agreement between the parties involved in the \nissuance. In case the parties involved agree on a governing law different from that of the \nmarket in which the issuance is taking place, the parties would also have to specifically \ndetermine the jurisdiction of a court in which provisions of the bond or note issuance (e.g., \nsettlement agency) could be enforced and any disputes would be heard and decided. \nSome markets in ASEAN+3 may specify which governing laws or jurisdictions for a bond \nor note issuance may be employed in addition to the laws of that market. Table 9 displays a \ncomparative view of the findings on governing law and jurisdiction across ASEAN+3 markets.\nIn discussions with potential issuers and other stakeholders, the significance of setting \nthe governing law and applicable jurisdiction(s) of a bond or note issuance was reiterated, \nin particular if the issuer has already raised bond or note issuance documentation under \na specific governing law and is hoping to reuse said documentation. In addition, investor \ndemand or the eligibility for certain investors to invest in bonds and notes only if issued \nunder the laws or jurisdiction of the investors\u2019 own domicile, for example, may drive the \napplication of certain governing laws or jurisdiction(s). ", "AMBIF Bond and Note Issuance: Relevant Features across ASEAN+3 Markets 23\nTable 9: Comparative View of Governing Law and Jurisdiction across AMBIF Markets\nMarket Governing Law and Jurisdiction\nHong Kong Basic Law, and the stated views of the relevant regulatory authorities and market \ninstitutions, permit the use of a governing law or jurisdiction other than the Laws of Hong Kong for \nHong Kong, \ntransactions in the financial markets of Hong Kong, China. Parties involved in a bond or note issuance \nChina\nmay select the governing law or jurisdiction(s) according to their contractual preferences, provided that \nsuch provisions do not contravene the Laws of Hong Kong. \nGoverning law and jurisdiction, with respect to the Terms and Conditions of the Notes, may be agreed \namong the contracting parties, subject to relevant provisions in applicable laws and regulations. In cases \nJapan\nof bonds and notes settled in Japan, at present, JASDEC requires that the Terms and Conditions of the \nNotes shall be governed by Japanese law.\nMalaysian law permits the use of a governing law or jurisdiction other than Malaysian law in contracts, \nprovided that such provisions do not contravene any existing laws of Malaysia. The decision on the \ngoverning law and jurisdiction for bonds, notes, and sukuk (Islamic bonds) issued to Sophisticated \nInvestors in Malaysia tends to be investor driven. The key question in the setting of the underlying law \nis the enforcement in case of a dispute arising. For example, in the case of a secured bond or a note, \nregulations prescribe that the governing law must follow the jurisdiction in which the underlying assets \nMalaysia\nare located. In this manner, governing law and jurisdiction provisions in bond, note, and sukuk issuance \ndocumentation follow the standard practices in common loan documents.\nIn the case of issuance of MYR-denominated bonds, notes, or sukuk in Malaysia, even when the \ncontracting parties choose a governing law other than Malaysian law for the contract, it is expected that \nMalaysian law would prevail as the law specific to issuance- and settlement-related matters.\nThe civil code of the Philippines permits the use of a governing law or jurisdiction other than the \nPhilippines in contracts, provided that such provisions do not contravene any existing Philippine laws.\nShould the parties involved in a bond or note issuance choose to use Philippine law, the jurisdiction of \nthe issuance would fall to Philippine courts by default.

Also, in the case of a profile listing on the SGX \nSingapore\nWholesale Bonds market, the governing law and jurisdiction for the bond or note issuance is left to the \nparties involved.

Issuers may choose to use a credit rating if it satisfies investor demand. As of \nHong Kong,  2014, the majority of bonds and notes listed on HKEx carried an investment grade rating.\nChina  \nA credit rating is also not a specific criterion for eligibility to list a bond or note aimed at professional \ninvestors in the Professional Bonds market on HKEx. \nNote issuance programs and corporate bonds and notes listed on TPBM must obtain a rating from a \ncredit rating agency recognized internationally and/or by Japanese investors. The rating itself needs to \nbe disclosed but the level of the rating is not an eligibility criterion for TPBM.\nWith regard to bonds and notes issued by a foreign government or local government (domestic and \nJapan foreign), guaranteed by a central or local government (domestic or foreign), or issued by certain \nfinancial institutions recognized by the TSE, a credit rating is not required.\nCredit rating agencies recognized by TSE-TPBM include (i) Standard & Poor\u2019s, (ii) Moody\u2019s, (iii) Fitch \nRatings, (iv) Rating and Investment Information, (v) Japan Credit Rating Agency, and (vi) RAM Rating \nServices Bhd. \nIn principle, all bonds, notes, and sukuk (Islamic bonds) issued in Malaysia and denominated in \nMalaysian ringgit require a credit rating from a credit rating agency approved by the SC.\nUnder the Lodge and Launch Guidelines (Chapter 2), FCY-denominated issuances do not require \na credit rating. Since August 2014, the SC has given issuers the flexibility not to have rated MYR-\ndenominated issuances aimed at Sophisticated Investors, but this concession comes with the limitation \nthat such PDS and sukuk cannot be traded for at least 2 years.\nMalaysia The complete removal of the mandatory credit rating requirements for bonds, notes, and sukuk issued \nin the Malaysian market will take effect in 2017. Although international ratings are accepted, domestic \ninvestors seem to favor a domestic credit rating for MYR-denominated bonds, notes, and sukuk. The \ncredit rating of a bond, note, or sukuk issue must be made available to the SC upon an application to \nissue, offer, or invite to subscribe or purchase PDS or sukuk.\nDomestic credit ratings are available from Malaysian Rating Corporation and RAM Rating Services Bhd, \nboth of which are registered with the SC, pursuant to the Guidelines on Registration of Credit Rating \nAgencies, 2011.\ncontinued on next page", "26 Implementation of the ASEAN+3 Multi-Currency Bond Issuance Framework\nTable 11   continued \nMarket Credit Rating Requirements\nBonds and notes to be listed or enrolled on PDEx require a credit rating in line with the credit rating \nrequirements stipulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission and BSP. \nIn its Memorandum Circular No. 7 released in March 2014, the Securities and Exchange Commission \nannounced the Guidelines on the Accreditation, Operations and Reporting of Credit Rating Agencies, \nwhich govern the two domestic credit rating agencies, Philippine Rating Services (PhilRatings) and \nCredit Rating and Investors Services Philippines, in addition to an acceptance of international credit \nrating agencies.\nPhilippines\nUnder BSP regulations, unsubordinated debt requires a rating of at least AA on the Philippine domestic \ncredit rating scale.

The BSP also accepts credit ratings \nfrom Fitch Ratings, Moody\u2019s, and Standard & Poor\u2019s, as well as Fitch Singapore. PDEx accepts credit \nratings from a credit rating agency duly recognized by the applicable regulatory authorities.\nUnrated bonds and notes are possible under present regulations and may be listed on the PDEx \nQualified Board; however, it has been observed that potential AMBIF investors may prefer for bonds \nand notes to have a credit rating.\nBonds and notes issued to Institutional Investors in the Singapore domestic bond market do not require \na credit rating. At the same time, a credit rating is one of three possible alternative criteria for eligibility \nto list a bond or note aimed at Institutional Investors on the Wholesale Bonds market on SGX. Most \nSingapore issuers do not choose to use the credit rating criterion when considering listing on SGX.\nThe majority of bonds and notes issued in the Singapore domestic bond market, typically denominated \nin Singapore dollars, are unrated.\nUnder SEC regulations, a credit rating for PP-AI issuances is not mandatory.

Policy bodies and regulatory authorities exercise their \nmandate through a combination of legislation and rules for the securities market. The key \npoint of these regulations is the prevention of the sale or offer of securities, including bonds \nand notes, to investors who are considered unable to make complex investment decisions. In \nrecognition of these important considerations, AMBIF has been devised from the outset with \na focus on professional bond markets and market segments in ASEAN+3 economies.\nSelling and transfer restrictions for the issuance or offer for sale or subscription of bonds and \nnotes to professional investors are well defined in the law, supplementary regulations, and \nlisting rules in participating jurisdictions. Methods, qualifications, and conditions for these \nselling and transfer restrictions may vary from market to market (Table 12), but all result in \nobligations by the market\u2019s professional participants to apply these rules and regulations. \nThis principle is well understood and supported by professional market participants. \nAt the same time, many markets do not directly regulate interactions among professional \nmarket participants. While professional investor concepts are defined in legislation or \nregulations in most jurisdictions, these regulations do not contain specific limitations on \ntheir activities with professional counterparties. Instead, in addition to the licensing of \nprofessional institutions, the governance of market activities is often delegated to a suitable \nself-regulatory organization, such as a market association, that governs its members with the \nhelp of a code of conduct expected to be observed in the course of daily business. All these \nprovisions work on the basis that professional participants are in a position to make their own \ndecisions based on available information, conditions, and circumstances in the marketplace. \nThis applies across all markets.\nFor a better illustration, the list below includes a number of basic mechanisms for effective \nselling and transfer restrictions that have been observed in participating AMBIF markets, \noften in combination with one another:\n1.  A clear-cut definition and rules on selling and transfer restrictions for the \nprofessional market exist in the law, in supplementary regulations or listing rules, as \nmay be applicable. \n2.  These provisions are publicly available to investors and market participants, together \nwith the Terms and Conditions of the Notes. \n3.  A description of the selling and transfer restrictions is mentioned and available in \nthe Terms and Conditions of the Notes. \n4.  In the case of physical certificates, the selling and transfer restrictions are printed on \nthe certificates in a prominent and easily recognizable manner.\n5.  These bonds and notes are being issued to, or traded through, licensed dealers and/or \nunderwriters. \n6.  The following practice is shared among market participants: the solicitation and \noffer for sale or subscription by the seller must be made only to professional \ninvestors and persons reasonably believed to be professional investors, and the \nseller must announce to professional investors that they are selling by employing \nsuch exemptions or special rules exempted from full disclosure requirements and/or \nregistration with the regulatory authorities. \n7.

All selling and transfer restrictions for bonds and notes intended for Institutional \nInvestors are also well defined in the issuer\u2019s selling documentation in accordance with the related \nprovisions under the SFO.\nIn addition, intermediaries for trades in bonds or notes listed as Professional Bonds, or in OTC-traded \nbonds and notes aimed at professional investors, are subject to the Code of Conduct for Persons \nLicensed by or Registered with the SFC (SFC Code of Conduct) in which the duties and obligations of \nthese intermediaries are described, including limitations to selling and transfer of such bonds and notes \nto investors who do not qualify as professional. Intermediaries are required to reference the SFC Code \nof Conduct in their know-your-customer materials and procedures. Specific language for selling and \nHong Kong,  transfer restrictions exists in the Hong Kong, China market and is expected to be used.\nChina\nThe SFC Code of Conduct also contains a definition of professional investors, as proposed and used \nby the Hong Kong Association of Banks. Membership in the association requires the recognition and \nacceptance of the SFC Code of Conduct and the definitions contained therein.\nA recent court ruling determined that exemptions claimed for bond and note issuance to professional \ninvestors via private placements, in contrast with public offers, will only apply if the issuance \ndocumentation and offering materials carry explicit statements that said bonds and notes are only to be \nsold to professional investors. This court ruling is presently under appeal.\nIn this context, the SFC has started public consultations on the need to strengthen the manner in which \nmarket participants treat professional and nonprofessional investors. Concluded changes to the present \nSFO provisions are expected to take effect by March 2016.\nThe FIEA so far requires that a contract on transfer restrictions should be signed between the issuer \nand the person (Professional Investor) to purchase the bonds or notes and between the solicitor or \nofferor (Securities Company) and the purchaser or acquirer. The FIEA also provides the requirement of \nnotification to the purchaser to the effect that the bonds or notes are not notified to the authority, the \nsecurities registration statement or the shelf-registration statement is not registered with the FSA, and \nmay be sold only to Professional Investors.\nIn addition, a contract on transfer restrictions and notification with a Professional Investor for all TPBM-\nrelated bond and note transactions may be allowed in current market practice.

Licensing requirements include the commitment of the institution and individual \nholders to observe any applicable selling restrictions.\nA bond, note, or sukuk listed for profiling under the BMS Exempt Regime, by its nature, would be limited \nto Sophisticated Investors at issuance and in secondary market transactions. These limitations would \nalso need to be observed by transaction intermediaries or Capital Market Services License holders, as \nper the prevailing regulations.\nSelling and transfer restrictions for the issuance of bonds or notes to professional investors are well \ndefined in the identified professional market segment in the Philippines (Qualified Buyers and Qualified \nSecurities).\nPursuant to SRC Sections 9 and 10, the IRR published by the SEC prescribe a template and specific \nprovisions on the use of that template, and define the selling and/or transfer restrictions when issuing \nbonds or notes to Qualified Buyers.\n \nTo further ensure that an exemption claimed by an issuer under Section 10.1 of the SRC when issuing \nbonds or notes aimed at Qualified Buyers, the SEC also looks to the underwriter\u2014licensed by the SEC\u2014\nto observe the applicable provisions and selling and transfer restrictions under the law.\nIn all offer documents and related correspondence to Qualified Buyers, including the term sheet of a \nPhilippines\nproposed bond or note issue, an issuer must make explicit reference to SRC Section 10.1 (L) and give its \ncommitment that said offer is limited to Qualified Buyers, thereby constituting an Exempt Transaction \nunder the law. The IRR related to SRC Section 10.1 (1.c) prescribe the following statement in bold-face \nand prominent type:\nThe securities being offered or sold have not been registered with the Securities and Exchange \nCommission under the Securities Regulation Code, any future offer or sale thereof is subject \nto registration requirements under the Code unless such offer or sale qualifies as an Exempt \nTransaction.b\nIn addition, appropriate selling or transfer restrictions will need to be printed on the actual issued \ninstrument, typically global or jumbo certificate(s) in bold font if certificates are to be issued.

Amended Implementing Rules and Regulations of the Securities Regulation Code. http://www.sec.gov \n.ph/laws/irr/AmendedIRRfinalversion.pdf\nSource: ABMF SF1.\nNote Issuance Programs\nFeedback from potential issuers in the region led to the inclusion of note issuance programs \nin the description of AMBIF. Issuers appeared very keen on the use of medium-term note \n(MTN) programs, an effective instrument in most bond markets, due to their flexibility \nand because funding demands for working capital, for example, may be primarily mid-term \nin nature. As a practical method of corporate funding in both domestic and international \nmarkets, note issuance programs are often preferred by issuers for the ability to tap markets \non short notice. For issuers with a regional presence, a note issuance program under AMBIF ", "AMBIF Bond and Note Issuance: Relevant Features across ASEAN+3 Markets 31\nwould allow access to a number of target markets with a single set of defined issuance \ndocumentation and disclosure, through the use of the SSF. \nAMBIF promotes the use of note issuance programs, such as the MTN format, because they \ngive funding flexibility to issuers and represent the most common format of bond and note \nissuance in the international bond market. This means that potential issuers, investors, and \nintermediaries are likely to be familiar with note issuance programs and related practices, \nmaking AMBIF comparable to the relevant practices in the international bond market. At the \nsame time, it is expected that potential issuers can benefit from reusing or adopting existing \ndocumentation or information on disclosure items.\nThe ability of potential issuers to use note issuance programs under AMBIF differs across \nparticipating markets (Table 13). While some of the more mature markets regularly see note \nissuance under MTN programs, often due to the more international participation in these \nmarkets, other jurisdictions are now studying the conditions and concessions for introducing \nnote issuance programs, particularly MTN programs. Where approval of an issuance amount \nfor nonresident issuers is required, the use of note issuance programs may be limited, since \nsuch approvals may not be able to correspond to the intended issuance amounts under the \nprogram for the duration of the approval period.\nBond Trustee, Bondholder Representative, or Bond Manager\nSince its work began in Phase 1, ABMF has been conscious of the need for strong and well-\ndefined investor protection in the region\u2019s bond markets, which is one of the key mandates \nof the securities market and prudential regulators in each jurisdiction. In its Phase 1 Report, \nABMF published a comparative analysis of investor protection mechanisms in each \njurisdiction, with a focus on those mechanisms aimed at protecting retail or general investors.\nOnce the AMBIF proposal was defined, attention turned to the question to what extent \nsuch investor protection mechanisms would be required by the regulatory authorities or, in \nturn, by the professional investors themselves in the context of AMBIF, which advocates \na professionals-only bond market. One of the key subjects in this regard was the need to \nappoint a representative of the bondholders who can act independently of the issuer and its \nagents. In the markets\u2019 relevant laws and regulations, this function is variously defined as a \nbond or general trustee, bondholder representative, or bond manager. For the purpose of this \nreport, the term bondholder representative shall be used.\nWhile most markets prescribe the need for a bondholder representative to be appointed \nin the context of a bond or note issuance, relevant provisions for the professional markets \nin each ASEAN+3 economy allow for concessions under certain circumstances or outright \nexemptions. At the same time, the actual appointment of a bondholder representative for a \ngiven bond or note issue was found to be determined largely by the target investor universe, \nregardless of market of issuance. Prudential regulations for professional investors, such as \nmutual or pension funds, often limit the investment of these institutions to assets that have \nspecific protection features, including the use of a bondholder representative and regulatory \nprice-finding mechanisms. As such, issuers targeting mutual and pension fund investors \nwould be more inclined to appoint a bondholder representative.\nTable 14 gives a brief overview of the applicable provisions for bondholder representatives \nacross the participating markets. ", "32 Implementation of the ASEAN+3 Multi-Currency Bond Issuance Framework\nTable 13: Comparative View of Note Issuance Programs across AMBIF Markets\nMarket Note Issuance Program\nNote issuance programs are well established and widely accepted in the Hong Kong, China market, \nand are the most preferred option for issuance to professional investors, both in the domestic and \nHong Kong, \ninternational segments. Issuers include domestic corporates and government-linked organizations. \nChina\nNote issuance programs are subsumed under bonds and notes in the definition of securities in the SFO \nSchedule 1.\nNote issuance programs are well established and widely accepted in TPBM. Program information is \nequivalent to the euro MTN program and indicates the maximum limit for the value of bonds that can \nbe issued within a set period together with basic financial and other information. Program information \nis rated and a candidate for lead managing underwriter is listed. Once this is done, one can flexibly issue \nJapan\nand list bonds on TPBM at the time of issuance. Program information is basically treated as the SSI \nprescribed in Article 27-31 of the FIEA. Therefore, by submitting program information to the exchange \nfor public announcement, one can start solicitation for the investment in bonds that are newly issued \nbased on said program information.\nNote issuance programs are well established and widely accepted in the Malaysian market. In addition \nto MTN programs for bonds and notes, the market also features Islamic MTN programs for the issuance \nof sukuk (Islamic bonds).\nMalaysia\nIn the Lodge and Launch Guidelines published in March 2015, note issuance programs are referred to as \n\u201cdebt programmes.\u201d\nAt this stage, the issuance of PHP-denominated domestic bonds and notes to professional investors \nvia an MTN program is not evident in the Philippine market. However, a listing or enrollment on PDEx, \nPhilippines for example, would be possible as USD-denominated note issuance programs have been evident in \nthe Philippines for some time. In addition, a shelf-registration concept exists, though this is not directly \ncomparable to shelf-registration concepts typically practiced in other markets.\nNote issuance programs are well established and widely accepted in the Singapore market. The legal \nSingapore basis for the use of note issuance programs can be found in Section 240A of the SFA, which provides \nfor a debenture issuance program.\nAt this stage, the issuance of domestic bonds and notes to professional investors via an MTN program \nis not evident in the Thai market. However, Thailand has an MTN-like program in which the issuer \nwho has updated publicly available information (e.g., a Thai listed company or a foreign company that \nhas submitted updated information to the SEC) can refer to such information in the offering circular, \ninstead of submitting the whole document. In addition, the cooling-off period for the issuance under \nThailand PP-AI is only 1 business day. However, PDMO cannot grant a blanket approval to a foreign issuer for the \nmaximum issuance amount in any given period under the MTN-like note issuance program, due to the \nlimited quota available. Therefore, an approval will be given on an issuance-by-issuance basis.\nThe SEC is in the process of evaluating the benefits of bond and note issuance via an MTN-like program \nsimilar to international markets. \nAMBIF = ASEAN+3 Multi-Currency Bond Issuance Framework; FIEA = Financial Instruments and Exchange Act; MTN = medium-term note; \nPDEx = Philippine Dealing & Exchange Corp.; PDMO = Public Debt Management Office; PHP = Philippine peso; PP-AI = Private Placement \nto Accredited Investors; SEC = The Securities and Exchange Commission, Thailand; SFA = Securities and Futures Act; SFO = Securities and \nFutures Ordinance; SSI = Specified Securities Information; TPBM = TOKYO PRO-BOND Market; USD = US dollar.\nSource: ABMF SF1.", "AMBIF Bond and Note Issuance: Relevant Features across ASEAN+3 Markets 33\nTable 14: Comparative View of Bondholder Representatives in AMBIF Markets\nMarket Bondholder Representative\nIssuers or their agents in the issuance of a bond or note to professional investors may appoint a bond \nHong Kong, \ntrustee. Having a bond trustee is optional for bonds and notes issued to professional investors and/or \nChina\nprofile listing on HKEx.\nThe appointment of a bond trustee or commissioned company or person (bond manager) for bonds \nJapan or notes to be listed on TPBM is optional. The majority of bonds and notes listed on TPBM instead \nfeature a fiscal agent as an agent of the issuer.\nThe SC prescribes the use of a trust deed\u2014and appointment of a bond trustee\u2014for a bond, note, or \nsukuk (Islamic bond) issuance, in accordance with the underlying provisions in the CMSA, Sections \n258ff. Certain exceptions to this requirement exist, such as when the bond, note, or sukuk issuance is \noffered exclusively to foreign investors or other entities specifically mentioned in Schedule 8 of the \nCMSA.\nThe bond trustee is to be appointed by the Principal Adviser. The need for a trust deed is prescribed by \nMalaysia\nthe SC in Chapter 2 (Trust Deed and Trustee) of the Lodge and Launch Guidelines. At the same time, \nthe minimum content requirements of the trust deed are detailed separately in the Guidelines on Trust \nDeeds, 2011.\nBond trustees, which must be registered with the SC, are licensed trust companies or public \ncompanies. Bond trustees are expected to be involved in the bond, note, or sukuk issuance \ndocumentation process.\nUnder the PDEX Listing Rules (7.3.8), debt securities to be listed or enrolled on PDEx must have a \nFacility Agent (or trustee). The issuer needs to appoint the Facility Agent. The duties of a Facility \nPhilippines\nAgent follow for the most part the tasks normally associated with a bond trustee or bondholder \nrepresentative. \nThe appointment of a bond trustee for professional bond and note issuances is optional, but the \nmajority of bonds and notes listed for profiling on the SGX Wholesale Bonds market feature a bond \ntrustee. This is driven by market practice and conventions with regard to targeted Institutional \nSingapore Investors who are subject to prudential regulations, such as insurance companies and mutual and \npension funds.\nTrustees for bonds and notes may be trustee companies as well as financial institutions.\nSEC regulations require the appointment of a bondholder representative only if a bond or note is \noffered through a public offer. This is not mandatory for PP-AI issuances. However, PDMO requires \nthe appointment of a bondholder representative for bonds and notes issued by a foreign issuer under \nthe Baht Bond program in every case. The SEC does not require the issuer to appoint a bondholder \nrepresentative when a bond or note issued in another jurisdiction is offered for sale in the PP-AI \nmarket.\nThailand\nAccording to the law, the issuer shall appoint the bond or debenture holder representative in Thailand \nduring the tenure of the bond for the benefit of the holders. The bondholder representative calls for \nbondholder meetings or undertakes all such activities as may be required on behalf of the bondholder, \nincluding in the case of a default.\nBondholder representatives typically are banks or financial institutions, and have specific fiduciary and \nfiscal responsibilities under Thai law.\nAMBIF = ASEAN+3 Multi-Currency Bond Issuance Framework; CMSA = Capital Market and Services Act; HKEx = Hong Kong Exchanges and \nClearing Limited; MTN = medium-term note; PDEx = Philippine Dealing & Exchange Corp.; PDMO = Public Debt Management Office; PP-AI \n= Private Placement to Accredited Investors; SEC = The Securities and Exchange Commission, Thailand; SC = Securities Commission Malaysia; \nSGX = Singapore Exchange; TPBM = TOKYO PRO-BOND Market.\nSource: ABMF SF1.", "IV\nAMBIF Implementation Guidelines \nfor Participating Markets\nAMBIF Implementation Guidelines are aimed at providing potential issuers and other \nstakeholders with guidance on which issuance documentation and disclosure items \ncontained in the SSF are required for the applicable regulatory processes in each market, \nand how these regulatory processes function. Hence, it is practical to study the SSF together \nwith the AMBIF Implementation Guidelines for a given market to better understand the \nnecessary actions and expectations in that market.\nThe AMBIF Implementation Guidelines for participating markets contain brief explanations \nof the AMBIF Elements and focus on detailed descriptions of the equivalent features in each \ndomestic bond market. The AMBIF Implementation Guidelines highlight the additional \nfeatures of AMBIF aimed at making the concept more conducive for acceptance by issuers, \ninvestors, and other stakeholders, and put these features in the context of the available \nfeatures and practices in each AMBIF market. The individual regulatory processes\u2014whether \napprovals or submissions for issuance, listing, or registration\u2014are also described in greater \ndetail, including the provision of links to the respective regulations and latest documentation \nand disclosure requirements. \nA number of illustrations included in the AMBIF Implementation Guidelines are intended to \naid in the navigation of the regulatory processes, particularly in markets where distinctions \nbetween issuer types and/or between the denomination of debt securities in local and \nforeign currencies are made, or where other conditions and criteria may exist.\nAs more ASEAN+3 markets participate in AMBIF, the corresponding AMBIF \nImplementation Guidelines for these markets will be published on the AsianBondsOnline \nwebsite.\nFor the Implementation Guidelines of the six markets joining AMBIF as the first group, \nplease see Hong Kong, China (Appendix 4); Japan (Appendix 5); Malaysia (Appendix 6); the \nPhilippines (Appendix 7); Singapore (Appendix 8); and Thailand (Appendix 9).", "V\nRecommendations and Next Steps\nABMF SF1 would like to submit this report to the Chairs of the Asian Bond Markets Initiative \nTask Force 3 as the key output of ABMF Phase 3. This chapter of the Phase 3 Report contains \nthe recommendations derived from the work by ABMF SF1, including its members and \nexperts, and the next steps that ABMF SF1 is hoping to pursue. \nIn the Phase 2 Report, ABMF SF1 proposed to agree on the AMBIF Core Components \namong stakeholders, and recommended the implementation of AMBIF with due \nconsideration of pilot issues. Many of these objectives have been achieved: the AMBIF \nElements as key features of AMBIF were agreed upon and presented in this Phase 3 Report, \nand the first pilot AMBIF bond issuance was under way at the time this report was being \ncompiled. At the same time, the work of implementing AMBIF demands more progress. \nThese are our recommendations and the proposal for next steps.\nExpanding AMBIF Participating Markets\nAMBIF began with the participation of six markets: Hong Kong, China; Japan; Malaysia; the \nPhilippines; Singapore; and Thailand. We must now increase the number of participating \nmarkets. The Republic of Korea is expected to join AMBIF before the end of 2015, and \ndiscussions with the relevant authorities in the People\u2019s Republic of China, Indonesia, and \nViet Nam are continuing. The other markets in the region are expected to join when they are \nready. ABMF should support them proactively to accelerate their participation in AMBIF as \nsoon as possible.\nSupporting the Development of Market Practices\nAMBIF is still at a very early stage of development and a lot of fine-tuning may be necessary. \nThe usability of the SSF and Implementation Guidelines needs to be assessed through pilot \nissuances, and market practices for AMBIF also need to be developed and evolve as AMBIF \nbond issuances increase. The present prescriptions of necessary market features for AMBIF \nand those of the regulatory processes detailed in the AMBIF Implementation Guidelines \ncan also be expected to change in line with experiences and lessons learned from AMBIF \nimplementation. Hopefully, ABMF will be an avenue not only to support the development of \nbond markets, but also to harmonize the markets in the region. The SSF and Implementation \nGuidelines are expected to shape the documentation and disclosure practices in the \nregion. New products and issuances using the AMBIF template will drive familiarity among \nregulators, authorities, and market participants, and increase their willingness to further \nimprove related processes and build capacity in support of a proven concept. AMBIF seeks \nto improve and streamline the regulatory processes and contribute to the ease of issuing \nunder AMBIF, thereby leading to an increase in interest in domestic and intraregional cross-", "36 Implementation of the ASEAN+3 Multi-Currency Bond Issuance Framework\nborder issuance and investment. Thanks to the positive reaction from ABMF members, we \nhave already witnessed new business opportunities through AMBIF for specific offerings \naimed at professional investors in the region. Such developments necessitate the continuous \nupdating of the AMBIF Implementation Guidelines and SSF until a time when AMBIF and its \npractices are well established.\nCreating a More Conducive Environment\nAs the number of AMBIF bond issuances increases and the related market practices \nmanifest themselves, ABMF SF1 should discuss how to create a more conducive \nenvironment to support the recycling of funds in the region through AMBIF and its related \nfeatures. Feedback from ABMF members and experts, as well as from potential issuers and \ninvestors, has indicated a number of areas in which benefits could be realized by exploring \npotential improvements. These include (i) more harmonized, or at least comparable, credit \nrating requirements and, in particular, the admission of regional credit rating agencies to \nmore or all markets; (ii) the existence and interpretation of the provisions for an event of \ndefault, and a better understanding or highlighting of critical points relating to bankruptcy \nor insolvency in the context of bond or note issuance; (iii) the extension of documentation \nrecommendations to include standard covenants and other clauses, similar to regional \nor global documentation standards in other business areas, such as repurchase (repo) or \nsecurities lending transactions; and, last but not least, (iv) tax regimes that support cross-\nborder investments.\nSome of the improvements may also come from the initiatives of ABMF Sub-Forum 2, which \npresently focuses on the standardization and efficiency of domestic and cross-border bond \ntransactions. The Cross-border Settlement Infrastructure Forum is likely to help deliver tools \nand mechanisms to channel and process cross-border bond issuances and investments more \nsmoothly.", "Appendix 1 \nThe Single Submission Form\nAs explained in detail in this report, the Single Submission Form (SSF) serves as a practical \nconduit for the implementation of the ASEAN+3 Multi-Currency Bond Issuance Framework \n(AMBIF) in ASEAN+3 markets by offering to both potential issuers and the regulatory \nauthorities in each market the ability to conduct the bond and note issuance regulatory \nprocess in a more harmonized, practical, and predictable manner1.\nThe SSF contains a set of the most common issuance information and disclosure items \nfound across the existing regulatory processes in participating ASEAN+3 markets, and is \nrecognized for that purpose by all relevant regulatory authorities. The SSF may be used in the \ncontext of issuance, listing, and registration processes in AMBIF markets and be sufficient for \nsubmission in some markets, while requiring additional documentation or market-specific \ninformation in other markets. Where a submission of physical forms is no longer necessary, \nthe SSF may be used as a checklist for the information to be submitted online. This is \nparticularly useful in cases where an issuer intends to access a number of markets using the \nsame issuance and disclosure information.\nIn recent years, ASEAN+3 bond markets have added features and become more conducive \nto the activities of issuers and investors, not least as a result of the work of the Asian Bond \nMarkets Initiative and ASEAN+3 Bond Market Forum. As such developments are expected \nto continue, whether driven by stakeholder input or as a result of the regular reviews by \npolicy bodies and regulatory authorities, the SSF is expected to evolve in line with resulting \nchanges in regulatory processes. That makes the SSF a living document and will lead to \ncorresponding updates of the form on a regular basis. Every new version of the SSF posted \nin the public domain will have already been reviewed and accepted for use in the context of \nAMBIF by each participating market\u2019s regulatory authorities.\nInterested parties are encouraged to obtain the latest version of the SSF from the ASEAN+3 \nBond Market Forum website via AsianBondsOnline.2 \n1  ASEAN+3 comprises the 10 members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations plus the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China, Japan, and the Republic of Korea.\n2  ASEAN+3 Bond Market Forum.

Experience gained in the ASEAN+3 Bond Market Forum (ABMF) Phase 3 \nshows that each stakeholder tends to look at AMBIF and its features, intended benefits, and \nresulting opportunities from a distinct perspective.\nThe Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) aim to relate specific facts and features of AMBIF \nand the Single Submission Form (SSF), and address potential concerns or questions \ninterested parties may have. The questions represent those encountered in the course of \nPhase 3 and the responses are consistent with those given to and acknowledged by ABMF \nmembers and experts, and market participants, particularly during the first few months \nof\u00a02015.\nIndividual questions in the FAQs relate to the purpose and merit of the SSF, its use in \ngeneral and in specific processes, and its use in conjunction with additional documentation \nor disclosure requirements in some markets. In response to specific questions from \nstakeholders, adequate levels of disclosure and selling and transfer restrictions are explained \nin the FAQs, as are a number of SSF fields and their purpose. \nSince both AMBIF and the SSF are expected to evolve as a result of the pilot issues and \nexperiences during AMBIF implementation in individual markets, additional questions and \nsuitable responses will be added to the FAQs, as needed, to maintain it as an easily accessible \nand relevant reference document. Hence, interested parties are encouraged to avail \nthemselves of the latest version of the FAQs, which will be available, together with the latest \nversion of the SSF, on the ABMF website via AsianBondsOnline or from one of the mirror sites \nof ABMF member institutions in support of AMBIF.", "Frequently Asked Questions on AMBIF and the SSF 57\nFrequently Asked Questions on the ASEAN+3  \nMulti-Currency Bond Issuance Framework  \nand the Single Submission Form\nPrepared by the ASEAN+3 Bond Market Forum Sub-Forum 1 and reviewed by the AMBIF \nDocument Recommendation Board\nQuestions:\nI.    What is the objective or merit of the SSF?  60\n  Q1.  What can the SSF achieve?  60\n  Q2.   Since the stage of development differs among ASEAN+3 bond  \nmarkets, and the SSF is acknowledged as a living document,  \ndoes this mean that there will be a number of different versions of the \nSSF circulating? This could be confusing for issuers, intermediaries, and \napproving authorities.  60\n  Q3.   If an issuance application in different markets may require different  \ninformation and procedures, what is the merit of the SSF?  60\n  Q4.   What if a market\u2019s regulatory process cannot accommodate the SSF,  \nsuch as in cases when the regulatory process is evolving?  61\nII.    Who are the users of the SSF?  61\n  Q5.

What is the usability of the SSF in targeted markets?  62\n  Q8.   Can the SSF accommodate both multiple market issuances and offers  \nfor sale in multiple markets at the same time?  62\n  Q9.   Are issuers required to indicate all markets of interest at once  \nwhen submitting the SSF?  63\n  Q10.   Regarding the domestic vs. cross-border aspect of issuance and listing,  \nthe SSF can support resident and nonresident issuers\u2019 local currency  \nfunding as well as intraregional (cross-border) offering of bonds  \nand notes by adding visibility through listing or registration. Is this the  \nintention of AMBIF?  63\n  Q11.

Some of the information in the SSF or in the accompanying  \ndocumentation may be sensitive or confidential. How is such  \ninformation treated?  64\n  Q18.   Who will approve the SSF for each market? In particular,  \nsince the SSF may still require distinct submissions for each market,  \nwhat is the strategic value of the SSF?  65\nV.    AMBIF and the SSF: disclosure-related questions  65\n  Q19.   AMBIF seems to utilize a private placement scheme. In a private  \nplacement, disclosure is normally not continuous but simply at the time  \nof issuance only. Is this understanding correct?  65\n  Q20.   Regarding continuous disclosure, what is considered to be the cycle  \nof continuous disclosure, and what type of disclosure is intended,  \nto the public or only to professionals?  66\n  Q21.   Does the issuer need an information memorandum to submit together  \nwith the SSF, or does the SSF suffice? An information memorandum  \nis typically used for disclosure for a private placement, mainly  \nto professional investors. But, in some markets, the submission  \nof an information memorandum is not mandatory or regulated.  66\n  Q22.   An issuer provides offering materials to professional investors  \n(hereafter AMBIF Investors) such as the prospectus, which has more  \ninformation than the SSF. Is the intention for the SSF to replace  \na prospectus or similar disclosure documents?  66\n  Q23.   Does limited disclosure mean less transparency in the markets?  \nWhat is the target of transparency, i.e., level of transparency?  67\n  Q24.   If an AMBIF market is more flexible than a public offering market,  \nwould issuers move to AMBIF? Is there any risk of regulatory arbitrage?  67\nVI.    Appropriate handling of selling and transfer restrictions  68\n  Q25.   AMBIF requires a professional market in each jurisdiction;  \nthese professional markets need to have strong mechanisms  \nto protect nonprofessional investors. How can these mechanisms,  \nsuch as appropriate and effective selling and transfer restrictions  \nin each market, be established and maintained?  68\nVII.   Listing-related questions  69\n  Q26.   If the focus on professional investors is intended to allow limited  \ndisclosure, lower costs, and shorter time to market, a potential profile  \nlisting requirement being one of the AMBIF Elements appears  \nto increase disclosure and may lead to higher costs?  69\n  Q27.  What is the strategic value of a profile listing in the region?  69\nVIII.  Specific questions on the SSF  69\n  Q28.   What level of detail is expected for Section II.1, Field 9:  \nTrends of Key Financial Data? This is information that is not  \ncustomary in our market.  69\n  Q29.   What level of information is expected for Section II.1, Field 11:  \nRisk Factors? Such information may not be required for submission  \ninto the issuance approval process in all participating markets.  70\n  Q30.   What type and level of information is expected for Section II.2, Field 2: \nOther Matters\u2014Subsequent Events?  70", "Frequently Asked Questions on AMBIF and the SSF 59\n  Q31.   How much information is expected for Section II.2, Field 2: Other \nMatters\u2014Litigations? Going back 3 years, or any other timeframe?  70\n  Q32.   What level of detail or information on outstanding debt from previous \nissues should be provided for Section III, Field 26? If the issuer issues  \ndebt on a regular and continuous basis in a number of markets,  \nthis could entail a significant amount of data and the required effort  \nto compile it.  70\n  Q33.   The SSF has a field for Credit Rating. Does this mean that obtaining  \na credit rating is mandatory for an AMBIF issuance?  70\n  Q34.   In the context of AMBIF, would regulators accept an SSF  \nthat includes documentation that conforms to Regulation S (Reg S) \nissuances?  71\nIX.   CSD-related questions  71\n  Q35.   In some markets, the settlement agency (CSD) is not listed  \namong the authorities and market institutions, but in other markets  \nit is. Why?  71\n  Q36.   Can ICSD participate in AMBIF, since the focus is on domestically  \nsettled bonds?  71\nX.    Information Platform-related questions  72\n  Q37.   The SSF serves as the maximum common denominator for bond  \nand note issuance applications and disclosure information. While \nparticipating markets continue to have different issuance procedures \nand different disclosure practices, the SSF is expected to bridge these \ndifferences effectively. Wouldn\u2019t it be better to have a single, central \nplatform for such information to be stored and made viewable  \nin a common location?  72\nXI.    ADRB-related questions  72\n  Q38.  What is ADRB?  72\n  Q39.  What are the ADRB recommendations?  72", "60 Appendix 2\nI.    What is the objective or merit of the SSF?\nQ1.   What can the SSF achieve? \n    A1.   The Single Submission Form (SSF) is designed to facilitate an ASEAN+3 \nMulti-Currency Bond Issuance Framework (AMBIF) bond and note \nissuance application to regulatory, listing, and registration authorities in \neach participating market. This Form is aimed at containing a common set \nof information to be submitted when applying for AMBIF bond and note \nissuance for each participating market. The contents in the SSF can largely \nbe used as either disclosure for bonds or notes issued under a program \nor a shelf-registration, or for a discrete stand-alone AMBIF bond or note \nissuance.\n       Issuers who are considering bond and note issuances in multiple places in \nASEAN+3 would benefit the most from the SSF. Over the long-term, the \nSSF aims to serve as a standard documentation template within AMBIF \nmarkets. This could also facilitate increased intraregional cross-border \ninvestment among regional investors.\nQ2.    Since the stage of development differs among ASEAN+3 bond markets, and the \nSSF is acknowledged as a living document, does this mean that there will be a \nnumber of different versions of the SSF circulating? This could be confusing for \nissuers, intermediaries, and approving authorities.\n    A2.   This concern is understood and, no, there will always only be one version \nof the SSF at any single point in time. This is necessary not only to maintain \nthe integrity of the SSF and the concept of AMBIF, but also to make any \nimprovements immediately available to all stakeholders.\nQ3.    If an issuance application in different markets may require different information \nand procedures, what is the merit of the SSF? \n    A3.   The SSF is defined on the basis of a common set of information to be \nsubmitted when applying for AMBIF bond and note issuances across the \nparticipating markets. Therefore, the aim of and general expectation for \nthe SSF is that one (version of) the SSF can cover a large portion of all \nnecessary information to be submitted to the authorities in each market. \nWhere this would not fulfill all requirements in a given market, basically \nthe SSF and supplemental documentation to cover market-specific \nrequirements would need to be prepared. \n       In this context, it is important to note that AMBIF as a market is still at \nthe beginning of its expected development. As AMBIF bond and note \nissuances grow in number, more beneficial features may be introduced \ninto the market. At the same time, the process of developing the AMBIF \nmarket will also aid in harmonizing and standardizing AMBIF processes and \npractices.", "Frequently Asked Questions on AMBIF and the SSF 61\nQ4.    What if a market\u2019s regulatory process cannot accommodate the SSF, such as in \ncases when the regulatory process is evolving? \n    A4.   As also explained at other points in these Frequently Asked Questions \n(FAQs), the introduction of the SSF does not prevent the regulatory \nprocess in each market from requiring additional information (not \ncontained in the SSF) or separate legal documents to be submitted. The \nSSF is intended to contain the most common set of issuance information \nand disclosure items drawn from the existing processes in participating \nmarkets at the time of inception.\n       Where a market does not require, or no longer requires, the physical \nsubmission of documentation, the SSF can serve as a checklist or a guiding \ntemplate, since the information required in such submissions is still likely to \ncontain relevant items shown in the SSF. At the same time, the use of the \nSSF continues to be useful and practical, in particular if an issuer intends to \nmake intraregional offerings through the use of note issuance programs. In \nsuch cases, while the SSF may be used as a checklist in one market, it may \nstill be submitted into the regulatory processes in other target markets.\nII.    Who are the users of the SSF?\nQ5.   Who are the target users of the SSF? \n    A5.   The target users of the SSF are corporate issuers based in ASEAN+3 who \nintend to issue bonds and notes in a participating domestic bond market(s) \nin ASEAN+3. Ideally, the use of proceeds from such bond or note issuances \nis intended for the funding of domestic operations or investments in \nASEAN+3 economies.\nQ6.   Can government bonds be issued under AMBIF?\n    A6.   Yes, they can. The issuance of government bonds, or issuance by \ngovernment agencies or related corporations, are not excluded under \nAMBIF. However, the main focus will be on corporate bond and note \nissuances, since sovereign issuers already typically enjoy exemptions from \nfull disclosure requirements and receive concessions that are presently not \nexplained in the Implementation Guidelines. \nQ7.   Do AMBIF issuers have to use the SSF?\n    A7.   From the viewpoint of the relevant authorities, using the SSF is not \nmandatory in any of the participating markets and issuers are not required \nto use the SSF. At the same time, however, the use of the SSF is an integral \npart of the AMBIF concept, and any streamlining of regulatory processes \nand possible future concessions would be linked to the AMBIF market. \nHence, an application for an AMBIF bond or note issuance should be \nexpected to be made by using the SSF.", "62 Appendix 2\nIII.   What is the usability of the SSF in targeted markets?\nCurrent Usability Status of the SSF by the Recognition of the Regulatory and/or Listing \nAuthorities in Six Markets in the Region\nTargeted Market Related Description\nHong Kong, China As long as laws are observed and the SSF is in compliance with listing rules, it is \nexpected to be accepted.\nJapan TSE (TPBM\u2019s listing authority) is receptive to exploring a single-submission-\ndocument process (e.g., the SSF) that adheres to TPBM\u2019s current professional \nbond listing requirements and processes.\nThe SSF can be treated as the Specified Securities Information (SSI) by \nmentioning clearly on the SSF that it is a SSI. Then, the SSF can be applied for \nthe listing process on TPBM.\nMalaysia Since June 2015, the Lodge and Launch Framework no longer requires \npreissuance approval. Under this new framework, the SSF may serve as a \nchecklist when lodging documentation and information with the SC, and may \nsupport submission of a listing application for the BMS Exempt Regime.\nPhilippines The SSF is acceptable but additional information and/or document(s) may be \nrequested during the evaluation process, as necessary.\nSingapore SGX is receptive to exploring a single-submission-document process (e.g., the \nSSF) that adheres to SGX\u2019s current bond listing requirements and processes.\nThailand The SEC will recognize the SSF format as long as the requirements of \nThai regulations continue to be observed. The SEC does not prescribe a \nparticular form or format for PP-AI documentation and disclosure items, \nbut specifies the minimum content of such disclosure in Sections 69 and \n70 of the Securities and Exchange Act B.E.2535, 1992 (as amended). These \nrequirements have been incorporated into the SSF. Also, additional documents \nmay be requested during the evaluation process, as necessary. At present, \nthe SSF may not be used for issuance under MTN programs in Thailand, but \nthe SEC is exploring the introduction of an MTN program, in addition to the \nexisting MTN-like program, which is closer to a shelf-registration concept.\nBMS = Bursa Malaysia Securities; MTN = medium-term note; PP-AI = Private Placement to Accredited Investors; \nSEC = The Securities and Exchange Commission, Thailand; SGX = Singapore Exchange; SSF = Single Submission \nForm; TPBM = TOKYO PRO-BOND Market; TSE = Tokyo Stock Exchange\nSource: ABMF SF1.\nQ8.    Can the SSF accommodate both multiple market issuances and offers for sale in \nmultiple markets at the same time?\n    A8.   Yes, basically, it can. The SSF is recognized by most of the authorities and \nmarket institutions in ASEAN+3 for that purpose. Ticking the respective \nboxes in the SSF can show which authorities and market institutions were \napplied to for an approval and profile listing or registration when bonds \nor notes are issued. Also, by ticking the targeted professional investors \nmarkets, the SSF can show where the bonds or notes are intended to be \noffered or solicited.", "Frequently Asked Questions on AMBIF and the SSF 63\nQ9.    Are issuers required to indicate all markets of interest at once when submitting \nthe SSF? \n    A9.   No, they are not. Under the current SSF format, an issuer can submit an SSF \nfor the market(s) of intended issuance and, should they wish to later issue \nin other market(s) as well, submit a separate SSF indicating the additional \nmarket(s). (For more details, please refer to SSF Section I.2: Distinction \nof the Form.) For practical reasons and to maximize benefits, the issuer \ncould consider indicating all the potential issuance markets in the SSF at \nthe outset, even if the actual issuance may only take place over time. In this \ncontext, issuers may need to consider the validity of an issuance approval in \na given market.\nQ10.   Regarding the domestic vs. cross-border aspect of issuance and listing, the SSF \ncan support resident and nonresident issuers\u2019 local currency funding as well \nas intraregional (cross-border) offering of bonds and notes by adding visibility \nthrough listing or registration. Is this the intention of AMBIF?\n    A10.   Yes, it is. AMBIF is aiming to facilitate intraregional funding and \ninvestments. Hopefully, the SSF and the Implementation Guidelines, which \nwill be accepted by the market authorities, will provide certainty and clarity \n(and minimize uncertainty) on the bond and note issuance process. Also, it \nis hoped that multiple listings or registrations, together with flexibility in the \nchoice of governing law, will bring more regional professional investors. \nQ11.   The Implementation Guidelines are focused on the bond and note issuance \nprocess in domestic market(s), how will the solicitation of bonds and notes in \nother markets be undertaken? \n    A11.   The SSF is designed to indicate both the places where to issue the bonds \nand notes, and where to solicit professional investors to purchase. But \nImplementation Guidelines can always (only) focus on the issuance \nand regulatory process in a given domestic market. Therefore, detailed \nregulatory information or market features for intraregional listing and \nsoliciting of bonds and notes need to be checked (cross-referenced) in the \nBond Market Guide and Implementation Guidelines related to the specific \ninvestment market. \nIV.   How to apply and/or submit the SSF?\nQ12.  Is the SSF alone sufficient to apply for AMBIF bond and note issuances?\n    A12.   The SSF is recognized by all regulatory, listing, and registration authorities \nin the participating AMBIF markets, and is designed to contain the most \ncommon set of information stipulated by these authorities. In some \nmarkets, the information may be sufficient for an application of issuance \nor listing approval, while in other markets, additional information and/or \nother documents may need to be submitted. In any case, the submission \nof the SSF would not exclude the possibility of providing, or be asked to \nprovide, supplemental documents or disclosure information when applying \nfor an AMBIF bond or note issuance where the relevant authorities so ", "64 Appendix 2\nadmit or require. A typical example of a supplemental document may be \na Declaration by the Issuer that is designed to give regulatory authorities \ncomfort that the information submitted is complete and in compliance with \nlaws and regulations; the format of such declaration tends to be specific to \neach market. \nQ13.  How is the SSF applied in the context of a note issuance program?\n    A13.   When used in conjunction with a note issuance program, the SSF may be \nused separately for issuance approval of the program in the first instance \n(by choosing Type-P for Type of Submission) and individual drawdowns \nunder the program in every instance thereafter (by choosing Type-D for \nType of Submission).\nQ14.  Who submits or needs to submit the SSF to the approving authorities?\n    A14.   This follows the requirements or, more likely, the market practice in the \nparticipating AMBIF markets. While the regulatory authorities typically \nlook at the issuer as the submitting party, market practice may favor an \nintermediary such as an underwriter or advisor. At the same time, listing \nplaces often require the services of a separate listing agent or sponsor, even \nfor a profile listing application.\nQ15.  What is the approval timeline for the SSF?\n    A15.   The approval timeline for the SSF basically follows the existing approval \ntimeline stipulated in the regulatory process of each market. This \ninformation is mentioned in the AMBIF Implementation Guidelines for \neach market. But, at the same time, a shorter timeline may be expected in \nsome markets by using the SSF.\nQ16.  Should the SSF be submitted before or after pricing the bonds or notes?\n    A16.   Since the SSF is intended to facilitate the issuance approval process, \nthe SSF can be submitted to the regulatory authority before pricing; if \nnecessary, the SSF can be marked as provisional. (For more details, please \nrefer to SSF Section I.2: Distinction of the Form; there are three distinctions: \nNew, Renewal, and Amendment). If the market regulatory process so \nprescribes, another SSF can be submitted once pricing is concluded and \nother final details are available.\nQ17.   Some of the information in the SSF or in the accompanying documentation may \nbe sensitive or confidential. How is such information treated?\n    A17.   The SSF\u2014whether provisional or final\u2014is aimed only at the approving \nauthorities, not at investors or the market at large. Hence, any sensitive or \nconfidential information contained in the SSF should be easily contained \nuntil commencement of the pricing or actual issuance of the bonds or \nnotes.", "Frequently Asked Questions on AMBIF and the SSF 65\nQ18.   Who will approve the SSF for each market? In particular, since the SSF may still \nrequire distinct submissions for each market, what is the strategic value of the \nSSF?\n    A18.   Approval, acceptance, or recognition is given by each market\u2019s relevant \nregulatory and/or listing authorities. Though a difference in documentation \nmay continue to exist, the SSF and the AMBIF Implementation Guidelines \nprovide clarity and benefits to issuers in the bond and note issuance \nprocess, particularly when issuing in an unfamiliar market. In addition, it \nreduces documentation- and issuance-related costs for multiple issuances \nsince the most common set of information across markets is already \ncovered in the SSF.\n       Ultimately, the SSF is a reflection of current common practices in the \nprofessional bond markets in the region. This also means that the SSF and \nImplementation Guidelines will need to be continuously revised in line with \nthe evolution of market practices going forward. This is why we they are \nreferred to as living documents.\n       For convenience, the latest version of the SSF is available on the ASEAN+3 \nBond Market Forum (ABMF) website.1 The Implementation Guidelines for \nparticipating markets are also available on the ABMF website.\n       Please note that regular validation of the usability of the SSF and the \nImplementation Guidelines is expected during the process of pilot \nissuances in 2015. As a result of lessons learned from these and subsequent \nAMBIF issuances, the SSF, in particular, is expected to evolve. \nV.    AMBIF and the SSF: disclosure-related questions\nQ19    AMBIF seems to utilize a private placement scheme. In a private placement, \ndisclosure is normally not continuous but simply at the time of issuance only. Is \nthis understanding correct?\n    A19.   AMBIF is not the same as an existing typical buy-and-hold type private \nplacement. Also, the concept, definitions, and practices of private \nplacements are different in each market and/or jurisdiction. A professional \nmarket may be created in some jurisdictions by initially utilizing the existing \nframework of private placement; however, the disclosure information \npractice under AMBIF will be different. Hence, we should not equate \nAMBIF with prevailing or existing types of private placements because it \nmay give a wrong impression.   \n1   ASEAN+3 Bond Market Forum. Single Submission Form. http://tinyurl.com/AMBIF-Single \n-Submission-Form ", "66 Appendix 2\nQ20.   Regarding continuous disclosure, what is considered to be the cycle of \ncontinuous disclosure, and what type of disclosure is intended, to the public or \nonly to professionals?\n    A20.   Continuous disclosure in the context of AMBIF refers to regular material \ndisclosure\u2014typically annually, such as financial statements\u2014as agreed \nbetween the issuer and professional investors and/or as prescribed by a \nlisting place, plus material information in the course of business. At the \nsame time, issuers will typically define their disclosure intervals in line \nwith ongoing corporate obligations in their market of domicile; this could \nbe quarterly, semi-annually, or annually. Going forward, AMBIF market \npractice is expected to find the right balance.\nQ21.   Does the issuer need an information memorandum to submit together with the \nSSF, or does the SSF suffice? An information memorandum is typically used for \ndisclosure for a private placement, mainly to professional investors. But, in some \nmarkets, the submission of an information memorandum is not mandatory or \nregulated.\n    A21.   For an AMBIF bond or note issuance, only the submission of the SSF is \nrequired; other or additional documents may be submitted on a voluntary \nbasis or if the approving authority so specifies, as stated earlier. The \ninformation contained in the SSF can be collected from a number of \nsources, even if no information memorandum is available. The SSF can be a \nreplacement of the disclosure information in the information memorandum \nin some markets.\nQ22.   An issuer provides offering materials to professional investors (hereafter AMBIF \nInvestors) such as a prospectus, which has more information than the SSF. Is the \nintention for the SSF to replace a prospectus or similar disclosure documents?\n    A22.   No, the SSF is not intended to replace a prospectus. The term \u201cprospectus\u201d \nor \u201coffering circular\u201d is generally used for full disclosure documents of \npublic offers of securities. The prospectus or offering circular is meant to be \na formal legal disclosure document, which is required by and filed with the \nsecurities regulator, which provides details about an investment offering for \nsale to the public. On the other hand, the term \u201coffering memorandum\u201d or \n\u201cinformation memorandum\u201d is typically used in the context of disclosure \nfor a private placement, mainly to professional investors. For the soliciting \nof bonds and notes to AMBIF investors, limited or concise disclosure \ninformation or materials can be provided while using the SSF.\n       Existing disclosure document(s), such as a prospectus or offering circular, \nmust not be used or attached to the SSF because this would give the \nimpression that the issuance is a public offering aimed at general investors \nand retail investors. No underwriter will take such risk.\n       For AMBIF market issuances, if necessary, existing disclosure information, \nsuch as an offering memorandum or information memorandum, can be \nused with the SSF, and indicated as Documents Incorporated by Reference. \nIn addition, the following may also be used as Documents Incorporated by \nReference in the SSF: existing press releases that relate to material events, ", "Frequently Asked Questions on AMBIF and the SSF 67\nstandard disclosure document(s) such as annual reports, and designated \nfinancial information with an independent auditor\u2019s report.\n       An issuer can also choose not to designate its financial information as \nDocuments Incorporated by Reference, provided the issuer discloses its \nfinancial information in English in the home jurisdiction. For example, \nin case the issuer has continuously disclosed annual reports in English, \nwhich contain consolidated financial statements with independent auditor \nreports, the issuer may state such facts in the SSF and describe how AMBIF \nInvestors can access such annual reports (e.g., via a website).\nQ23.   Does limited disclosure mean less transparency in the markets? What is the \ntarget of transparency, i.e., level of transparency?\n    A23.   No, it does not. Transparency in disclosure in a professional market means \naccountability and accessibility of the consequential and continuous \ndisclosure information that has been agreed between parties involved being \navailable at certain times and in a certain format; thus, transparency itself \nis not affected by the limited disclosure status. Information available in a \nprofessional market may be different from the information available in a \npublic offering market. But this does not mean that a professional market \nis less transparent. The level of disclosure under AMBIF is geared toward \nthe professional market in each jurisdiction and has been compared against \ncurrent typical levels of disclosure and issuance application processes in \neach professional market, with the intention being to have the SSF reflect \nthe most common information required across markets. Furthermore, the \nlevel of information and scope depend on the degree of evolution of market \npractices. This level of disclosure may also be influenced by AMBIF bond \nmarket practices going forward. One possible benchmark would be the \nmarket practice in the international bond market, where participants are \ngenerally considered to be professionals.\nQ24.   If an AMBIF market is more flexible than a public offering market, would issuers \nmove to AMBIF? Is there any risk of regulatory arbitrage?\n    A24.   The creation of AMBIF will not lead to regulatory arbitrage. In each \njurisdiction, the AMBIF (professional) market, public offering market, and \ntraditional private placement will continue to coexist. There are merits and \ndemerits for each funding method, and all have different characteristics. \nA public offering may be able to access more investors, which may lead to \nlarger and sometimes cheaper funding, but regulatory requirements may \nbe higher. Also, just-in-time issuances and targeted issuances may not be \neasy. A private placement may only access a very small number of regular \ninvestors for limited issuance amounts. It typically has a buy-and-hold \nnature. AMBIF (professional) markets allow issuers and investors to agree \non all relevant terms and features to suit both sides. Issuers will decide \nwhich funding method best fits their financing needs.\n       The flexibility of an AMBIF market is only one perspective. From the \nregulators\u2019 point of view, one aspect of particular importance related to \nan AMBIF market operation will be the need to establish and maintain \nthe secure and effective ring-fencing (transfer restriction) of the market ", "68 Appendix 2\namong professional investors in its jurisdiction, for the protection of \nnonprofessional investors, without sacrificing market liquidity and market \nefficiency. This can typically be achieved by the imposition of specific \nselling and transfer restrictions. \nVI.   Appropriate handling of selling and transfer restrictions\nQ25.   AMBIF requires a professional market in each jurisdiction; these professional \nmarkets need to have strong mechanisms to protect nonprofessional investors. \nHow can these mechanisms, such as appropriate and effective selling and \ntransfer restrictions in each market, be established and maintained?\n    A25.   One key aspect of the regulatory mandate in the region\u2019s markets is the \nprotection of retail (general) and, in fact, all nonprofessional investors in \neach jurisdiction. Policy bodies and regulatory authorities exercise their \nmandate with a combination of legislation and rules for the securities \nmarket. Chief among these regulations is the prevention of the sale or offer \nof securities, including bonds, to investors that are considered not able to \nmake complex investment decisions.\n       Methods, qualifications, and conditions for these selling and transfer \nrestrictions may vary from market to market, but all result in obligations by \nthe market\u2019s professional participants to apply these rules. This principle is \nwell understood and supported by professional market participants.\n        In contrast, many markets do not directly regulate interactions among these \nprofessional market participants. While professional investor concepts are \ndefined in legislation or regulations in most jurisdictions, these regulations \ndo not contain specific limitations on their activities with professional \ncounterparties. Instead, in addition to the licensing of professional \ninstitutions, the governance of market activities is often delegated to a \nsuitable self-regulatory organization, such as a market association, that \ngoverns its members with the help of a code of conduct expected to be \nobserved in the course of daily business. All these provisions work on the \nbasis that professional participants are in a position to make their own \ndecisions based on available information, conditions, and circumstances in \nthe marketplace. This applies across all markets.\n       All market participants should understand the common basic mechanisms \nfor effective Selling and Transfer Restrictions in AMBIF markets in the region:\n \n1.  a clear-cut definition and rules on Selling and Transfer Restrictions \nfor professional market exist in the law, supplementary regulations, or \nlisting rules; \n2.  these provisions are publicly available to investors and market \nparticipants together with the Terms and Conditions of the Notes; \n3.  a Selling and Transfer Restrictions-related description is mentioned \nand available in the Terms and Conditions of the Notes; \n4.  these bonds and notes are issued or traded through licensed dealers \nand/or underwriters; ", "Frequently Asked Questions on AMBIF and the SSF 69\n5.  the solicitation and offer for sale by the seller must be made only \nto professional investors and persons reasonably believed to be \npersons who are professional investors; and the seller must announce \nto professional investors that the seller is selling by employing \nsuch exemptions or special rules exempted from full disclosure \nrequirements and/or notification to the authorities; and \n6.  appropriate enforcement for rule violations is available. \nVII.  Listing-related questions\nQ26.   If the focus on professional investors is intended to allow limited disclosure, \nlower costs, and shorter time to market, a potential profile listing requirement \nbeing one of the AMBIF Elements appears to increase disclosure and may lead \nto higher costs?\n    A26.   A focus on professionals is not intended to allow less or inferior disclosure. \nInstead, an issuer is able to utilize much of their existing disclosure \ninformation, and even include it in the SSF for reference, because \nprofessional investors can accept this in many or most professional \nmarkets. As a result, this may lead to lower issuance costs and expedited \naccess to the market(s). This disclosure information aimed at professional \ninvestors can also typically be utilized for a profile listing. Any (additional) \ncosts for a profile listing may have to be weighed against the wider range of \nprofessional investor access created by the profile listing. \nQ27.  What is the strategic value of a profile listing in the region? \n    A27.   The strategic value, in fact the reason why profile listing is part of the \nAMBIF Elements, is that a wide range of investor groups will only be able \nto invest in assets if they are listed (or at least registered). This aids the \nvisibility, transparency, and price finding of the bonds and notes as well. \nIn contrast, private placements, or typical forms of issuance of bonds and \nnotes to professional investors (without listing), would not be possible \nfor these investors to invest in. Since the ABMF mandate is in support of \ndeeper, broader, and more liquid bond markets in the region, part of this \nmandate is to make the markets more accessible to a broader professional \ninvestor universe.\nVIII.  Specific questions on the SSF \nQ28.   What level of detail is expected for Section II.1, Field 9: Trends of Key Financial \nData? This is information that is not customary in our market.\n    A28.   The SSF contains information and disclosure items required by the \nparticipating markets; it is aimed at providing common information for \nbond and note issuance approvals. However, this also means that not all \nfields or parts of the SSF are suitable for every market. At the same time, \nhowever, these trends of key financial data are information that is regularly \ndisclosed by issuers (listed companies). Hence, it would be practical to ", "70 Appendix 2\nprovide information, as necessary, in the same form and format, and the \nsame level of detail as already available.\nQ29   What level of information is expected for Section II.1, Field 11: Risk Factors? \nSuch information may not be required for submission into the issuance approval \nprocess in all participating markets.\n    A29.   Similarly to other disclosure information, risk factors are often part of \nthe typical disclosure obligations for an issuer. It is suggested to consider \nproviding information in accordance with details already published. \nUltimately, the level of information to be provided would be discussed with \nand decided by the issuer\u2019s legal counsel and, if necessary, the underwriter \nand their legal counsel.\nQ30.   What type and level of information is expected for Section II.2, Field 2: Other \nMatters\u2014Subsequent Events?\n    A30.   Subsequent Events or Recent Developments is a term used in \ndocumentation that refers to significant recent or future developments \nafter official closing of the last financial reporting period to the date of \nissuance, with a possible impact on the issuer or issuer\u2019s group. This type \nof information is often contained in a comfort letter, but not all markets \nparticipating in AMBIF have a well-established comfort letter practice. \nInstead, these markets may mention such developments in a dedicated \nsection of the information memorandum or offering circular for the bonds \nand notes; the field in the SSF could make reference to such available \ninformation as well. Ultimately, the issuer would discuss and decide with the \nhelp of legal counsel on the type and level of information to be provided. \nQ31.   How much information is expected for Section II.2, Field 2: Other Matters\u2014\nLitigations? Going back 3 years, or any other timeframe?\n    A31.   From a practical perspective, it may be best to disclose what has already \nbeen published by the issuer. Ultimately, the amount of information to be \ndisclosed will be decided by the issuer in conjunction with legal counsel.\nQ32.   What level of detail or information on outstanding debt from previous issues \nshould be provided for Section III, Field 26? If the issuer issues debt on a regular \nand continuous basis in a number of markets, this could entail a significant \namount of data and the required effort to compile it.\n    A32.   In principle, information on outstanding debt is a typical component of \nregular financial disclosure for any company. The objective of the SSF is to \nrecord information relevant for the approving authority. From a practical \nperspective, this may mean considering disclosing what has already been \npublished, in particular in the market of interest.\nQ33.   The SSF has a field for Credit Rating. Does this mean that obtaining a credit \nrating is mandatory for an AMBIF issuance?\n    A33.   No, the need to obtain a credit rating for an issuer of bonds or notes will \ndepend on the market(s) of planned issuance and solicitation as not ", "Frequently Asked Questions on AMBIF and the SSF 71\nall markets require a rating for bonds and notes aimed at professional \ninvestors. The SSF merely provides the space for this information if needed. \nFor more information, it is important to consult the AMBIF Implementation \nGuidelines for the relevant market(s), which will describe the specific \ninformation requirements for each market\u2019s approval process in detail. \nIn this context, it should be mentioned, that although a credit rating may \nnot be compulsory in some markets, expectations among professional \ninvestors might still include the provision of a credit rating to satisfy internal \ninvestment processes.\nQ34.   In the context of AMBIF, would regulators accept an SSF that includes \ndocumentation that conforms to Regulation S (Reg S) issuances? \n    A34.   Not likely. AMBIF is a bond and note issuance framework in ASEAN+3 \nand while the intention is to adopt international standards, the SSF \nand additional materials common to each market are the targeted, and \naccepted, documentation for issuance approval. At the same time, Reg\u00a0S \ndocumentation is typically aimed at investors in the United States, not \nregulators. Even for AMBIF issuances, any documentation aimed at the \nrespective professional investors would be separate from the SSF. The \ninclusion of a Reg S format or related information in the SSF or other \ndocumentation would very much depend upon the marketing strategy of \nthe issuer and the underwriter(s) toward foreign institutional investors.\nIX.   CSD-related questions \nQ35.   In some markets, the settlement agency (CSD) is not listed among the \nauthorities and market institutions, but in other markets it is. Why?\n    A35.   Depending on established market process, central securities depositories \n(CSDs) in some markets may receive the information relevant for the \nset-up and deposit of bonds and notes to be issued through the approving \nauthority or market institution, or they may not be involved in the actual \napproval process. In other markets, CSDs may require their own application \nor legal documentation to be submitted and/or executed, in addition to \nthe SSF, e.g., to fulfill legal or statutory requirements. These additional \nrequirements are not within the scope of the SSF.\nQ36.   Can ICSD participate in AMBIF, since the focus is on domestically settled \nbonds?\n    A36.   Absolutely. International CSD (ICSD) can still service their account holders \nby acting as global custodians for the clients and using their correspondents \n(sub-custodians) in the domestic markets. If the bonds or notes are \nprescribed to be settled domestically, the ICSD would not be able to \nprovide issuance services in the context of AMBIF.", "72 Appendix 2\nX.    Information Platform-related questions\nQ37.   The SSF serves as the maximum common denominator for bond and note \nissuance applications and disclosure information. While participating markets \ncontinue to have different issuance procedures and different disclosure \npractices, the SSF is expected to bridge these differences effectively. Wouldn\u2019t it \nbe better to have a single, central platform for such information to be stored and \nmade viewable in a common location?\n    A37.   The creation of the SSF is just a starting point. While the SSF itself is a living \ndocument, additional tools to support the submission procedures, or the \nregulatory processes at large, can be considered in the future as the AMBIF \nmarkets and market practices develop. At this stage, ABMF is focused on \nimplementing AMBIF. As a next step, ABMF will discuss possible additional \nfeatures of AMBIF in selected working groups, such as the Information \nPlatform and its possible iterations. These working groups will constitute \nprior to the ABMF Meeting in August 2015.\nXI.   ADRB-related questions\nQ38.  What is ADRB?\n    A38.   ADRB, the AMBIF Documentation Recommendation Board, is an \ninitiative of market practitioners, industry experts, and researchers. ADRB \nwas established in the context of ABMF\u2019s work on AMBIF in order to \nadvise ABMF on professional bond market practices, including issuance \ndocumentation and disclosure practices. ADRB members and observers \ninclude debt capital market advisers, law and accounting firms, securities \nmarket intermediaries, research institutions, and bond and capital \nmarket associations. Participation is on a voluntary basis and participants \nare expected to proactively share their experience with members and \nobservers.\n       The objective of ADRB is to provide expert input, from time to time, to the \nABMF meetings and other such gatherings, on ABMF- and AMBIF-related \nsubjects from the consolidated perspective of a number of specialist \nindustry participants, and to discuss and put forward recommendations for \nthe practical application of specific market practices in the work of ABMF.\nQ39.  What are the ADRB recommendations?\n    A39.   In the context of ABMF, which focuses on the harmonization of regulations \nand standardization of market practices and self-regulatory rules relating \nto cross-border domestic professional bond market transactions in Asia, \nADRB has provided recommendations for the concept and contents of \nthe SSF, as well as a list and grouping of supplementary documentation \nexpected to be submitted for regulatory processes in participating AMBIF \nmarkets. ", "Frequently Asked Questions on AMBIF and the SSF 73\n       ADRB provided the Necessary Documentation Framework to ABMF in \nNovember 2013, effectively grouping typical issuance documentation and \ndisclosure items into a number of functional elements:\n\u2022\u2022 information memorandum or program information as the core \ndocument of disclosure about issuer and securities\u2019 information for \nAMBIF Investors;\n\u2022\u2022 conditions of bonds and notes, representing the rights of holders and \nobligations of issuer;\n\u2022\u2022 underwriting agreement, or similar indispensable document between \nissuer and investment banks or underwriters; and\n\u2022\u2022 relevant disclosure items representing the obligations of the issuer \nand its agents toward the underlying laws and/or the collective \nexpectations of professional AMBIF Investors.\n       Following ABMF discussions, the revised recommendation was published \nas an appendix, AMBIF Documentation Recommendation Board on \nAMBIF Disclosure Items on Information Memorandum and Program \nInformation, to the ABMF SF1 Phase 2 Report: Proposal on ASEAN+3 \nMulti-Currency Bond Issuance Framework. \n       Together with other elements of ABMF discussions during Phases 2 and\u00a03, \nthis recommendation led to the creation of the SSF.

While the \nHKD-denominated bond market is relatively small, many bonds and notes are issued \ninternationally in Hong Kong, China. \nTable A4.1 identifies the features and practices of the domestic bond market in Hong Kong, \nChina that directly correspond with or are equivalent to the AMBIF Elements.\nDescription of AMBIF Elements and Equivalent Features  \nin Hong Kong, China\nDomestic Settlement \nAMBIF\nAMBIF is aimed at supporting the domestic bond markets of ASEAN+3. To be recognized \nas a domestic bond or note, an AMBIF bond or note needs to be settled at the designated \ncentral securities depository (CSD). Hence, domestic settlement needs to be a key feature \nof an AMBIF bond or note.\nIn Hong Kong, China\nAll domestic corporate bonds and notes traded over-the-counter (OTC) in the Hong Kong, \nChina market are identified by the International Securities Identification Number (ISIN) \nprefix HK, and are admitted to and settled in the Central Moneymarkets Unit (CMU), a \nunit of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), regardless of the denomination.

Hence, the Single Submission Form (SSF) \nthat can be applied to all of the relevant regulatory processes for bond and note issuance \nacross markets was proposed. The information contained in the SSF can be submitted to all \nrelevant regulatory authorities and market institutions for relevant approvals or consent, or \nused in the context of the submission (e.g., as a checklist) in anticipation of an AMBIF bond \nor note\u00a0issuance.\nIn Hong Kong, China\nWhere bonds and notes are offered only to professional investors through private \nplacements, no approval for bond and note issuance is required from the Securities \nand Futures Commission (SFC) or HKMA. Thus, contracting parties\u2014such as issuers, \nunderwriters, and investors\u2014are free to set and agree on documentation and disclosure \nrequirements among themselves.", "78 Appendix 4\nTo be listed on Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited (HKEx) for visibility or profiling \npurposes, HKEx is in favor of using harmonized documents, as long as its application \nprocedures and all listing requirements are fulfilled.\nEnglish is one of the official languages of Hong Kong, China; hence, the SSF can be utilized, \nparticularly in the context of a profile listing since no issuance approval is required. \nRegistration or Profile Listing in ASEAN+3 (Place of Continuous Disclosure)\nAMBIF\nInformation on issuers, bonds, and notes needs to be disclosed continuously in ASEAN+3 \nmarkets. A registration or listing authority function to facilitate continuous disclosure is \nrequired. This can ensure the quality of disclosure and help create a well-organized market \nfor AMBIF issuances with transparency and a quality of information that differentiates \nAMBIF issuances from ordinary private placements for which information is often neither \navailable nor guaranteed. Owing to this important feature, an AMBIF secondary market is \nexpected to emerge as the number of issuances increases. \nA profile listing is a listing without trading on an exchange. The objective of the listing is to \nmake bonds and notes visible and more information available to investors via a recognized \nlisting place, particularly those investors with more restrictive mandates, such as mutual and \npension funds. A profile listing at a designated listing place can ensure the flow of continuous \ndisclosure information and possibly even reference pricing in some markets. \nIn Hong Kong, China\nHKEx Listing Rules provide a listing facility for bonds and notes aimed exclusively at \nprofessional investors. This facility is officially known as Debt Issues to Professional Investors \nOnly, and typically is referred to as Professional Bonds. Professional Bonds are still traded \nOTC but are listed for profiling only, typically in order to reach a specific investor universe or \naddress the need for a listing in potential investors\u2019 mandated prudential regulations.\nWhile the listing for profiling on HKEx is available for both domestic and international bonds \nand notes issued in Hong Kong, China, and HKEx Listing Rules do not prescribe a particular \nclearing house or place of settlement, the inclusion for settlement in CMU is required to \nmark a bond or note as domestic. Hence, for all intents and purposes, the availability of CMU \nsettlement, in conjunction with the listing for profiling on HKEx, satisfies the AMBIF Element \nof Registration or Profile Listing.\nAt the same time, a listing for profiling of AMBIF bonds and notes on HKEx may not preclude \na simultaneous listing for profiling for the benefit of (certain) professional investors in \nanother jurisdiction in ASEAN+3.\nCurrency\nAMBIF\nIn the context of AMBIF, the denomination of an issue is generally expected to be in the \ndomestic currency of each ASEAN+3 market. But this does not exclude the possibility of \nissuing in other currencies if market practice regularly supports these other currencies and \nthe relevant domestic currency or cash clearing capabilities exist. At this stage, US dollars, \nJapanese yen, and offshore Chinese renminbi are the currencies other than domestic \ncurrencies in which bonds and notes tend to be issued in ASEAN+3 markets.", "AMBIF Implementation Guidelines for Hong Kong, China 79\nIn Hong Kong, China\nIn addition to Hong Kong dollars, bonds and notes denominated in other currencies, \nincluding but not limited to US dollars and offshore Chinese renminbi, are regularly issued \nand settled at CMU. \nScope of Issuers\nAMBIF\nAs AMBIF is aimed at supporting the development of domestic bond markets in the region \nand promoting the intraregional recycling of funds, an issuer needs to be a resident of an \nASEAN+3 market. \nIn Hong Kong, China\nThere is no distinction between domestic and foreign issuers or particular corporate issuer \ntypes in the Hong Kong, China bond market. \nScope of Investors\nAMBIF\nProfessional investors are defined in accordance with regulations and/or market practice in \neach market in ASEAN+3. Some jurisdictions have a clear definition of professional investors, \nwhile other jurisdictions may need to establish the concept through agreements.  \nProfessional investors are institutions defined by law and licensed or otherwise registered \nwith regulators by law in their economy of domicile and, hence, are subject to governance \nand inspection based on securities market and/or prudential regulations. In addition, most of \nthem are also subject to oversight as well as professional conduct and best practice rules by a \nself-regulatory organization, such as an exchange or a market association. \nIn Hong Kong, China\nThe Securities and Futures Ordinance (SFO), Chapter 571 of the Laws of Hong Kong, \ndefines the concept of professional investors in Hong Kong, China; in its provisions, the SFO \ndistinguishes between Institutional Investors and Non-Institutional Investors, as shown in \nthe definitions below. In market practice, the term \u201cprofessional investors\u201d is used since the \nconcept is not limited to institutions or legal entities:\nThe SFO defines Institutional Investors as\n1.  regulated securities firms, any person carrying on the business of the provision of \ninvestment services regulated under the Laws of Hong Kong or the laws of any place \noutside Hong Kong, China;\n2.  regulated banks, any bank regulated under the Laws of Hong Kong or the laws of any \nplace outside Hong Kong, China;\n3.  regulated insurers, any insurer regulated under the Laws of Hong Kong or the laws of \nany place outside Hong Kong, China;\n4.  investment funds, any collective investment scheme authorized by the SFC or \nsimilarly constituted under the laws of any place outside Hong Kong, China, and, if \nregulated under the laws of such place, permitted to be operated under the laws of \nsuch place, or any person by whom any such scheme is operated; and\n5.  sovereign bodies, any government (other than a municipal authority) or any \ninstitution, which performs the functions of a central bank, or any multilateral \nagency.", "80 Appendix 4\nThe SFO defines Non-Institutional Investors as persons who, as a result of their financial \nposition, qualify as professional investors, including\n1.  High Net Worth Individuals, any individual (either alone or with any of his or her \nassociates on a joint account) who has a portfolio of not less than HKD8 million \n(or\u00a0its equivalent in any foreign currency);\n2.  corporate professional investors, any corporation or partnership with either a \nportfolio of not less than HKD8 million (or its equivalent in any foreign currency) \nor total assets of not less than HKD40 million (or its equivalent in any foreign \ncurrency); and\n3.  trusts, any trust corporation entrusted under the trust or trusts of which it acts as \na trustee with total assets of not less than HKD40 million (or its equivalent in any \nforeign currency).\nThe provisions of the above regulations specifically include foreign investors and foreign \ninstitutional investors.\nIn its dealings for the Professional Bonds market, HKEx uses the collective term \u201cprofessional \ninvestors,\u201d which includes both Institutional Investors and High Net Worth Individuals as \ndefined in the SFO. \nWith regard to CMU practices, issuers shall ensure that their bond or note issuance meets \nall regulatory requirements, including compliance with the SFO and the definitions for \nInstitutional Investors contained therein, before lodging the bond or note with CMU.\nInstitutional Investors based in Hong Kong, China may invest in overseas markets without \nlimitation (other than certain types of investment in the Peoples\u2019 Republic of China), unless \nthese institutions\u2019 own mandates, investment guidelines, or specific prudential regulations \nprescribe particular restrictions. ", "AMBIF Bond and Note Issuance: \nRelevant Features in Hong Kong, \nChina\nIn addition to the market features corresponding with the AMBIF Elements, a number of \ngeneral market features for AMBIF bond and note issuance to professional investors in the \nHong Kong, China domestic bond market will need to be considered, and are described in \nthis chapter. \nGoverning Law and Jurisdiction \nGoverning law and the jurisdiction for specific service provisions in relation to a bond or note \nissuance may have relevance in the context of AMBIF, since potential issuers may consider \nissuing under the laws or jurisdiction of a market other than the place of issuance.  The choice \nof governing law or the contractual preferences of stakeholders can affect the accessibility to \na specific investor universe that may otherwise not be accessible if a bond or note were issued \nunder the laws of the place of issuance. However, it is necessary to point out that laws related \nto bond or note issuance and settlement must be governed by the laws and regulations of the \nplace of issuance since an AMBIF bond or note is a domestic bond or note.\nHong Kong Basic Law, and the stated views of the regulatory authorities and market \ninstitutions, permit the use of governing law or jurisdictions other than the Laws of Hong Kong \nfor transactions in the financial markets of Hong Kong, China. Parties involved in a bond or \nnote issuance may select the governing law or jurisdiction(s) according to their contractual \npreferences, provided that such provisions do not contravene the Laws of Hong Kong. \nLanguage of Documentation and Disclosure Items\nIt is envisaged that most of the ASEAN+3 markets participating in AMBIF will be able to \naccept the use of a common document in English; however, some markets may require \nthe submission of approval-related information in their prescribed format and in the local \nlanguage. In such cases, concessions from these regulatory authorities for a submission of \nrequired information in English, in addition to the local language and formats, may be sought.\nIn Hong Kong, China, contracts, bond and note issuance documentation and disclosure \nitems, applications to and approvals from market institutions, and correspondence with \nregulatory authorities and market institutions are expected to be in English.\nCredit Rating\nA credit rating is not mandatory for bonds and notes to be issued to professional investors \nin the Hong Kong, China market. Issuers may choose to use a credit rating if it would satisfy ", "82 Appendix 4\ninvestor demand. As of 2014, the majority of bonds and notes listed on HKEx carried an \ninvestment grade rating. \nA credit rating is also not a specific criterion for eligibility to list a bond or note aimed at \nprofessional investors in the Professional Bonds market on HKEx. \nSelling and Transfer Restrictions\nSelling and transfer restrictions for bonds and notes intended for professional investors are \nwell defined in Hong Kong, China in the law, supplementary regulations, and Listing Rules for \nthe Professional Bonds market on HKEx. \nAll selling and transfer restrictions for bonds and notes intended for Institutional Investors \nare also well defined in the issuer\u2019s selling documentation in accordance with the related \nprovisions under the SFO.\nIn addition, intermediaries for trades in bonds or notes listed as Professional Bonds, or in \nOTC-traded bonds and notes aimed at professional investors, are subject to the SFC\u2019s Code \nof Conduct for Persons Licensed by or Registered with the SFC (Code of Conduct) in which \nthe duties and obligations of these intermediaries are described, including limitations to \nselling and transfer of such bonds and notes to investors who do not qualify as professional. \nIntermediaries are required to reference the SFC Code of Conduct in their know-your-\ncustomer materials and procedures. Specific language for selling and transfer restrictions \nexists in the Hong Kong, China market and is expected to be used.\nThe SFC Code of Conduct also contains a definition of professional investors, as proposed \nand used by the Hong Kong Association of Banks. Membership in the association requires \nthe recognition and acceptance of the SFC Code of Conduct and the definitions contained \ntherein.\nA recent court ruling determined that exemptions claimed for bond and note issuance to \nprofessional investors via private placements, in contrast with public offers, will only apply if the \nissuance documentation and offering materials carry explicit statements that said bonds and \nnotes are only to be sold to professional investors. This court ruling is presently under appeal.\nIn this context, the SFC has started public consultations on the need to strengthen the \nmanner in which market participants treat professional and nonprofessional investors. \nConcluded changes to the present SFO provisions are expected to take effect by \nMarch\u00a02016.\nNote Issuance Programs\nAMBIF promotes the use of note issuance programs, such as the medium-term note (MTN) \nformat, because they not only give funding flexibility to issuers but also represent the most \ncommon format of bond and note issuance in the international bond market. This means \nthat potential issuers, as well as investors and intermediaries, are likely to be familiar with \nnote issuance programs and related practices. Hence, this would make AMBIF comparable \nto the relevant practices in the international bond market. At the same time, it is expected \nthat potential issuers may benefit from reusing or adopting existing documentation or \ninformation on disclosure items.", "AMBIF Implementation Guidelines for Hong Kong, China 83\nNote issuance programs are well established and widely accepted in the Hong Kong, China \nmarket, and are the most preferred issuance option for issuance to professional investors, \nboth in the domestic and international segments. Issuers include domestic corporates and \ngovernment-linked organizations. Note issuance programs are subsumed under bonds and \nnotes in the definition of securities in the SFO Schedule 1.\nBond Trustee and Trust Deed\nIssuers or their agents in the issuance of a bond or note to professional investors may appoint \na bond trustee. Having a bond trustee is optional for bonds and notes issued to professional \ninvestors and/or profile listing on HKEx.", "AMBIF Bond and Note Issuance \nProcess in Hong Kong, China\nOverview of Regulatory Processes \nBond or note issuances by corporate issuers aimed at professional investors in the \nHong\u00a0Kong, China bond market do not require any approval from or notice to regulatory \nauthorities. In consequence, there is no significance attached to the type of corporate issuer. \nAt the same time, in order to make the issuance processes by issuer type more comparable \nacross ASEAN+3 markets, Table A4.2 features common issuer type distinctions that are \nevident in regional markets. Not all markets will distinguish all such issuer types.

Disclosure requirements under the Financial Instruments and \nExchange Act (FIEA), such as the Securities Registration Statement for public offering, do \nnot apply to the securities listed on TPBM. Instead, disclosure requirements are stipulated \nin the rules and regulations of TSE, such as the Specified Securities Information (SSI) and \nIssuer Filing Information. \nTo be listed on TPBM for profiling purposes, TSE is receptive to exploring a single-\nsubmission-document process, as long as its application procedures and all listing ", "94 Appendix 5\nrequirements are fulfilled. The SSF can be treated as the SSI by mentioning clearly on the SSF \nthat it is the SSI. Then, the SSF can be applied for the listing process on TPBM. The use of \nEnglish in documentation for TPBM is accepted in TSE rules. \nRegistration or Profile Listing in ASEAN+3 (Place of Continuous Disclosure) \nAMBIF\nInformation on issuers, bonds, and notes needs to be disclosed continuously in ASEAN+3 \nmarkets. A registration or listing authority function to facilitate continuous disclosure is \nrequired. This can ensure the quality of disclosure and facilitate a well-organized market for \nAMBIF issuances with transparency and a quality of information that differentiates AMBIF \nissuances from ordinary private placements for which information is often neither available \nnor guaranteed. Owing to this important feature, an AMBIF secondary market is expected to \nemerge as the number of issuances increases. \nA profile listing is a listing without trading on an exchange. The objective of the listing is to \nmake bonds and notes visible with more information available to investors via a recognized \nlisting place, particularly those investors with more restrictive mandates, such as mutual and \npension funds. A profile listing at a designated listing place can ensure the flow of continuous \ndisclosure information and possibly even reference pricing in some markets. \nIn Japan \nTPBM on TSE is the single market in Japan for listed programs or listed bonds and notes \naimed at Professional Investors, and acts as a Specified Financial Instruments Exchange \nMarket pursuant to Article 2, Paragraph 32 of the FIEA.\nIssuers need to list a note issuance program and/or bonds and notes on TPBM in order to \nissue bonds and notes through TPBM. To apply for a new listing, the SSF (as the SSI) and \nother prescribed information, including written assurance for listing, are to be submitted \nto TSE. There is no need to submit any documents to regulators such as a local finance \nbureau or the FSA. In principle, information on listed bonds and notes, and information \non their issuers shall be disclosed pursuant to TSE\u2019s Listing Regulations and Enforcement \nRules for TPBM. At the time of a new listing (time of issuance) of a corporate bond or other \ninstrument, applicants (issuers) need to provide the SSI. \nEfforts have been made to reduce the cost and time required to prepare additional \ndocumentation at TPBM. Overseas issuers can use English disclosure information \ndocuments submitted to the authorities or exchanges in the economies where their bonds \nand notes are already listed, or the company is registered.\nBonds and notes listed on TPBM or issued based on the program information submitted \nto TSE are included within the Japan Securities Dealers Association\u2019s (JSDA) Reference \nStatistical Prices (Yields) for OTC Transactions.\nCurrency\nAMBIF\nIn the context of AMBIF, the denomination of an issue is generally expected to be in the \ndomestic currency of each ASEAN+3 market. But this does not exclude the possibility of \nissuing in other currencies if market practice regularly supports these other currencies and \nthe relevant domestic currency or cash clearing capabilities exist. At this stage, US dollars, ", "AMBIF Implementation Guidelines for Japan 95\nJapanese yen, and offshore Chinese renminbi are the currencies other than domestic \ncurrencies in which bonds and notes tend to be issued in ASEAN+3 markets. \nIn Japan \nTPBM on TSE does not have any limitations on the choice of currencies. Domestic bonds \nand notes in the Japanese market are typically issued in yen. In addition to settlement for \nbonds and notes issued in yen, JASDEC is able to transfer (on a free-of-payment basis) \nforeign-currency-denominated bonds and notes issued by governments or companies, such \nas those denominated in US dollars or other currencies. \nScope of Issuers\nAMBIF\nAs AMBIF is aimed at supporting the development of domestic bond markets in the region \nand promoting the intraregional recycling of funds, an issuer needs to be a resident of an \nASEAN+3 market.\nIn Japan \nThe regulations and practices on TPBM do not distinguish between resident and nonresident \nissuers. The scope of issuers on TPBM include\n1.  foreign corporations,\n2.  foreign financial institutions,\n3.  sovereign and government-sponsored issuers,\n4.  Japanese corporations, and\n5.  Japanese public entities (e.g., local governments).\nAll issuers may utilize note issuance programs as a form of bond or note issuance.\nScope of Investors\nAMBIF\nProfessional investors are defined in accordance with regulations and/or market practice in \neach market in ASEAN+3. Some jurisdictions have a clear definition of professional investors, \nwhile other jurisdictions may need to establish the concept through agreements.\nProfessional investors are institutions defined by law and licensed or otherwise registered \nwith regulators by law in their economy of domicile and, hence, are subject to governance \nand inspection based on securities market and/or prudential regulations. In addition, most of \nthem are also subject to oversight as well as professional conduct and best practice rules by a \nself-regulatory organization, such as an exchange or a market association.\nIn Japan \nJapan features one of the most comprehensive definitions of professional investors in \nASEAN+3, which includes institutional and high net worth investors with specific qualifying \ncriteria, and also foreign institutional investors. \nIn Japan, the definition of Professional Investor is stipulated in Article 2, Paragraph 31 of the \nFIEA and in the Cabinet Office Ordinance related to the definition stipulated in Article\u00a02 \nof the FIEA. The term \u201cProfessional Investor\u201d as used in the FIEA comprises (i) Qualified \nInstitutional Investors; (ii) the state (the Government of Japan); (iii) the Bank of Japan; \nand (iv) Investor Protection Funds prescribed by Article 79-21 and other juridical persons ", "96 Appendix 5\nspecified by Article 23 of the Cabinet Office Ordinance related to the definition stipulated in \nArticle 2 of the FIEA.\nProfessional Investors include pension funds, life insurance companies and other \naccredited institutional investors, listed companies, joint-stock corporations with at least \nJPY500\u00a0million in capital, government agencies, the Bank of Japan, and other approved \ncorporations and local governments, together with approved individuals with net financial \nassets of at least JPY300 million and at least 1 year of trading experience.

In consequence, a securities \ncompany may from time to time assure itself of the status of the investor based on the \ninvestor\u2019s intentions.\nResident Professional Investors in Japan can invest in overseas bonds and notes without any \nlegislative restrictions.", "AMBIF Bond and Note Issuance: \nRelevant Features in Japan\nIn addition to the market features corresponding to the AMBIF Elements, a number of \ngeneral market features for AMBIF bond and note issuance to Professional Investors in the \nJapanese domestic bond market need to be considered, and are described in this chapter. \nGoverning Law and Jurisdiction\nGoverning law and the jurisdiction for specific service provisions in relation to a bond or \nnote issuance may have relevance in the context of AMBIF since potential issuers may \nconsider issuing under the laws or jurisdiction of an economy or market other than the place \nof issuance. The choice of governing law or the contractual preferences of stakeholders can \naffect the accessibility to a specific investor universe that may otherwise not be accessible if \nbonds or notes were issued under the laws of the place of issuance. However, it is necessary \nto point out that laws related to bond and note issuance and settlement must be governed by \nthe laws and regulations of the place of issuance since AMBIF bonds and notes are domestic \nbonds and notes.\nGoverning law and jurisdiction, with respect to the Terms and Conditions of the Notes, \nmay be agreed among the contract parties, subject to relevant provisions in applicable laws \nand regulations. For bonds and notes settled in Japan, at present, JASDEC requires that the \nTerms and Conditions of the Notes shall be governed by Japanese law.\nLanguage of Documentation and Disclosure Items\nIt is envisaged that most of the ASEAN+3 markets participating in AMBIF will be able to \naccept the use of a common document in English; however, some markets may require \nthe submission of approval-related information in their prescribed format and in the local \nlanguage. In such cases, concessions from these regulatory authorities for a submission of \nrequired information in English, in addition to the local language and formats, may be sought.\nDocumentation in English language is accepted by TPBM.\nCredit Rating\nNote issuance programs or corporate bonds and notes listed on TPBM must obtain a rating \nfrom a credit rating agency recognized internationally and/or by Japanese investors. The \nrating needs to be disclosed, but the level of the rating is not an eligibility criterion for TPBM.", "98 Appendix 5\nWith regard to the bonds and notes issued by a foreign government or local government \n(both domestic and foreign), or guaranteed by a national or local government (domestic or \nforeign), or by certain financial institutions recognized by TSE, a credit rating is not required.\nCurrently, credit rating agencies recognized by TPBM include \n1.  Standard & Poor\u2019s, \n2.  Moody\u2019s, \n3.  Fitch Ratings, \n4.  Rating and Investment Information, \n5.  Japan Credit Rating Agency, and \n6.  RAM Rating Services. \nLead Managing Underwriter List\nIn Japan, an issuer needs to choose a lead managing underwriter for a note issuance program \nor bonds and notes to be listed on TPBM from among the Lead Managing Underwriter List \nprepared by TSE. The Lead Managing Underwriter List is simply a list of securities companies \nthat could potentially serve as a lead managing underwriter when listing bonds or notes on \nTPBM or when disclosing program information. The current list can be found at http://www \n.jpx.co.jp/english/equities/products/tpbm/listing/04.html\nThis list will be updated by TSE according to the applications from securities companies.\nA securities company wishing to register on the list is to file an application with TSE. TSE, \nwhich will then examine the application while considering such factors as that party\u2019s \nappropriate domestic and overseas experience as a lead managing underwriter. Conversely, if \nTSE deems the continued inclusion on the list of a party to be inappropriate (as would be the \ncase, for instance, if that party decides to withdraw from the bond underwriting business), \nTSE, at its discretion, may remove that party from the list.\nA securities company is not required to pay a fee for inclusion on the Lead Managing \nUnderwriter List.\nOne exception exists for the need to select an underwriter from the Lead Managing \nUnderwriter List in case a financial institution deemed suitable by TSE were to purchase the \nwhole amount of a bond issue. Here, the financial institution would confirm the quality of the \nbonds or notes.\nAppointment of Entrustment of Bond Manager\nThe appointment of a bond trustee or commissioned company or person (bond manager) \nfor bonds or notes to be listed on TPBM is optional. The majority of bonds and notes listed \non TPBM instead feature a fiscal agent as an agent of the issuer.\nNote Issuance Programs\nAMBIF promotes the use of note issuance programs, such as the medium-term note \nformat, because they not only give funding flexibility to issuers but also represent the most ", "AMBIF Implementation Guidelines for Japan 99\ncommon format of bond and note issuance in the international bond market. This means \nthat potential issuers, as well as investors and intermediaries, are likely to be familiar with \nnote issuance programs and related practices. Hence, this would make AMBIF comparable \nto the relevant practices in the international bond market. At the same time, it is expected \nthat potential issuers may benefit from reusing or adopting existing documentation or \ninformation on disclosure items.\nNote issuance programs are well established and widely accepted on TPBM. Program \ninformation is equivalent to the euro medium-term note program and indicates the \nmaximum limit for the value of bonds that can be issued within a set period together with \nbasic financial and other information. Program information is basically to be rated, and a \ncandidate for lead managing underwriter is to be listed. Once this is done, one can flexibly \nissue and list the bonds on TPBM at the time of issuance. Program information is basically \ntreated as SSI, as prescribed in Article 27-31 of the FIEA. Therefore, by submitting program \ninformation to the exchange for public announcement, one can start solicitation for the \ninvestment in bonds that are newly issued based on said program information.\nSelling and Transfer Restrictions in TPBM\nSelling and transfer restrictions in the Japanese market are comprehensive and specific. \nBonds and notes issued through TPBM shall not be sold or transferred to any person other \nthan Professional Investors or nonresident (foreign) investors, as mentioned in Chapter\u00a0I.\nThe FIEA requires that a contract on restriction on transfer (transfer restriction agreements) \nshould be entered into between the issuer and the person (Professional Investor) seeking \nto purchase the bonds or notes, and between the solicitor or offeror (securities company) \nand the purchaser or acquirer. The FIEA also requires notification to the purchaser to the \neffect that if the bonds or notes are not notified to the authority, the securities registration \nstatement or the shelf-registration statement is not registered with the FSA, and the bonds \nor notes may be sold only to Professional Investors.\nIn addition, a restriction on transfer contract and notification with a Professional Investor \nfor all TPBM-related bonds and notes transactions in a comprehensive way may be allowed \nin current market practice. For further details, please refer to Questions 55 and 56, and the \nanswers thereto, in the Q&A section on the TPBM website.2\nIn July 2015, the FSA opened a public consultation on the potential relaxation of the \ndefined measures for selling and transfer restrictions laid out in Article 12 (i) (b) of the \nrelated Cabinet Office Ordinance.3 According to the FSA proposal, in addition to the \ncurrent entering into contracts between issuer and acquirer and between intermediary and \nprofessional investor, the current method could be replaced by other methods, including a \ndescription of the selling and transfer restrictions in the Terms and Conditions of the Notes, \n2  Japan Exchange Group.

The forms of the \nacknowledgment could be expected to develop in line with market practices following the \npublic consultation and resulting changes to the aforementioned Article 12.\nInclusion of selling and transfer restrictions in the Term and Conditions of the Notes is one \nway to fulfill a part of the requirements of the FIEA. The sample wording is shown in the text \nbox for reference.\nFinancial Reporting Standards\nTSE recognizes Japanese Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (J-GAAP), United \nStates Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (US-GAAP), and International Financial \nReporting Standards as financial reporting standards for an issuer. The TSE rules prescribe \nthat any alternative accounting standard may be recognized if TSE deems it to be equivalent \nto J-GAAP, US-GAAP, or International Financial Reporting Standards.

Method (i) will be explained in this section.\nListing for Profiling on TSE\u2019s TPBM \nTypically, the issuer is represented by a lead arranger, underwriter, or law firm that will file or \nsubmit the necessary application for listing and required documentation to TSE as the listing \nauthority.\nThe following steps will need to be undertaken by the issuer of bonds or notes (or agent of \nthe issuer) in the domestic bond market in Japan.\nStep 1: Submit Application for Listing to TSE\u2019s TPBM\nAny issuer (or its agent) intending to list on TSE\u2019s TPBM will need to submit a Listing \nApplication, accompanied by the required documentation and disclosure items for the type \nof listing selected.\nIn the case of a planned listing for profiling targeted at Professional Investors, the issuer (or \nagent) needs to select TSE\u2019s TPBM when applying. As a result, the specific documentation \nand disclosure requirements for TPBM, which differ significantly from the requirements \nfor public offerings on the TSE main board, need to be observed when submitting the \napplication.", "104 Appendix 5\nListing eligibility criteria\u2014how the note issuance program or bonds or notes qualify for a \nlisting on TSE\u2019s TPBM\u2014include the following:\n1.  A Note Issuance Program for a corporate issuer must have a rating from a rating \nagency.\n2.  In cases of a stand-alone issuance, corporate bonds or notes to be listed must have \na rating from a rating agency.\n3.  The securities companies acting as principal underwriters for the issuance must be \nregistered on the TPBM\u2019s Lead Managing Underwriter List.\nThe listing criteria for the general investors (retail) market differ significantly.\nAs for the key documentation and disclosure items, TSE offers standard forms for program \ninformation, SSI, and issuer information, but TSE\u2019s TPBM typically accepts an information \nmemorandum or offering circular prepared for the relevant bonds and notes, together with \nadditional documents as may be necessary. (The SSF for AMBIF will be treated as a new \nTSE-approved form.)\nIn principle, TSE requires an issuer to disclose basic information as follows:\n1.  securities information (Terms and Conditions of the Notes to be listed),\n2.  corporate information (outline of company and financial statements),\n3.  matters related to other securities (if any), and\n4.  information on guarantor of the company (if any).\nThe SSF will cover all of the necessary information listed above.\nStep 2: TSE Checks Application for Listing and Issues a Listing Approval\nTSE will check the application for listing, following the submission of the relevant information \nin documentation and disclosure items. TSE will confirm that the bonds or notes satisfy \nthe necessary conditions for listing eligibility in accordance with TSE rules.

Table A6.1 identifies the features and practices of the domestic bond and \nsukuk markets in Malaysia that directly correspond with or are equivalent to the AMBIF Elements.\nDescription of AMBIF Elements and Equivalent Features in Malaysia\nDomestic Settlement \nAMBIF\nAMBIF is aimed at supporting the domestic bond markets of ASEAN+3. To be recognized \nas a domestic bond or note, an AMBIF bond or note needs to be settled at the designated \ncentral securities depository (CSD). Hence, domestic settlement needs to be a key feature of \nan AMBIF bond or note.\nIn Malaysia\nAccording to the Guidelines on Unlisted Capital Market Products under the Lodge and \nLaunch Framework, 2015, Part 3, Chapter 2, Section 2.22, all MYR-denominated private debt \nsecurities (PDS) or sukuk must be issued and/or tendered on the Fully Automated System \nfor Issuing/Tendering (FAST), and settled in the Real-time Electronic Transfer of Funds \nand Securities System (RENTAS) unless an admission for listing and trading is sought on \nan exchange. PDS must be issued on a scripless basis and deposited into RENTAS, which is \noperated by MyClear\u2014the CSD for bonds, notes, and sukuk traded over-the-counter (OTC), \nand a wholly-owned subsidiary of Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM). \nIn the context of AMBIF, RENTAS provides the following services:\n\u2022\u2022 multi-currency funds and debt securities (government and corporate) settlement,\n\u2022\u2022 CSD and paying agent for scripless debt securities, and\n\u2022\u2022 MYR\u2013USD Payment-versus-Payment and Delivery-versus-Payment settlement via \nUSD Clearing House Automated Transfer System (CHATS).\n1  ASEAN+3 refers to the 10 members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) plus \nthe People\u2019s Republic of China, Japan, and the Republic of Korea.", "110 Appendix 6\nTable A6.1: AMBIF Elements and Equivalents in Malaysia\nAMBIF Elements Brief Description Equivalent in Malaysia \nDomestic Settlement Bonds and notes are settled at a national CSD in  Settlement of OTC bonds, notes, and sukuk \nASEAN+3 markets. in the Real-time Electronic Transfer of Funds \nand Securities System (RENTAS)\nHarmonized Documents  A common approach is of submitting  Since June 2015, the Lodge and Launch \nfor Submission (Single  information as input for regulatory process(es)  Framework no longer requires pre-issuance \nSubmission Form) where approval or consent is required.  approval; SSF can serve as checklist and \nAppropriate disclosure information along with  support submission of listing application for \nADRB recommendation needs to be included.

Hence, the Single Submission Form (SSF) that can be applied \nto all of the relevant regulatory processes for bond and note issuance across markets was \nproposed. The information contained in the SSF can be submitted to all relevant regulatory \nauthorities and market institutions for relevant approvals or consent, or used in the context of \nthe submission (e.g., as a checklist) in anticipation of an AMBIF bond or note\u00a0issuance.\nIn Malaysia\nThe introduction of the Lodge and Launch Framework in June 2015 removed the need \nfor pre-issuance approval by the Securities Commission Malaysia (SC), toward which the \npurpose of and information in the SSF has been geared.", "AMBIF Implementation Guidelines for Malaysia 111\nUnder the Lodge and Launch Framework, an issuer needs to lodge specific information \nand disclosure items, such as the principal terms and conditions (PTC), to the SC via the \nPrincipal Adviser prior to launching a bond, note, or sukuk issuance. (For more details on the \nPrincipal Adviser, please refer to the next chapter.) The information required is defined in the \nLodgement Kit, which is a supplement to the Lodge and Launch Guidelines; the lodgement \nis to be done electronically via the SC\u2019s dedicated Online Submission System. (For more \ndetails, see the third chapter in this document.) Some parts of the lodgement require the \nexecution and scanning of specific forms, such as a prescribed Declaration by the Issuer.\nFrom a practical perspective, in the context of the Lodge and Launch Framework, the SSF \nmay be used as guidance or a checklist for the information stipulated in the Lodgement Kit \nand required for lodgement to the SC. This may be of particular practical value for those \nissuers intending to access a number of AMBIF markets at the same time, and thereby using \nthe SSF for the submission to a number of other regulatory authorities to obtain issuance \napproval. It is the intention of ABMF to maintain the SSF as a living document, and to work \ntoward a convergence of common issuance information requirements with the applicable \nregulatory processes in ASEAN+3.\nIn Malaysia, the SSF may also help to facilitate the submission of a Listing Application to \nBursa Malaysia Securities (BMS) if a bond, note, or sukuk were intended to be listed for \nprofiling under the Exempt Regime feature on BMS, which is described in more detail below.\nDocuments, application forms, and correspondence in English are accepted for official \nsubmissions.\nRegistration or Profile Listing in ASEAN+3 (Place of Continuous Disclosure)\nAMBIF\nInformation on issuers, bonds, and notes needs to be disclosed continuously in ASEAN+3 \nmarkets. A registration or listing authority function to facilitate the continuous disclosure is \nrequired. This can ensure the quality of disclosure and help create a well-organized market \nfor AMBIF issuances with transparency and a quality of information that would differentiate \nAMBIF issuances from ordinary private placements for which information is often neither \navailable nor guaranteed. Owing to this important feature, an AMBIF secondary market is \nexpected to emerge as the number of issuances increases. \nA profile listing is a listing without trading on an exchange. The objective of the listing is to \nmake bonds and notes visible and more information available to investors via a recognized \nlisting place, particularly those investors with more restrictive mandates, such as mutual and \npension funds. A profile listing at a designated listing place can ensure the flow of continuous \ndisclosure information and possibly even reference pricing in some markets. \nIn Malaysia\nLodgement of the issuance documentation and initial disclosure items with the SC, and \nthe regulatory requirement for an issuer to provide regular updates on financial information \nto an appointed trustee and via FAST, together with the added feature of regular price \ndetermination by the Bond Pricing Agency Malaysia (BPAM), form the basis of the available \ndisclosure for offers aimed at Sophisticated Investors. In addition, the PTC are available on \nthe SC website, as well as via BPAM, and issuers must provide a pricing supplement for each \ndrawdown (new issuance) under a debt or sukuk program.", "112 Appendix 6\nTo complement these requirements with a mandated continuous disclosure regime, BMS \nprovides the option for both listed and nonlisted issuers to list PDS and sukuk for profiling \nunder its Exempt\u00a0Regime. PDS or sukuk to be listed under the Exempt Regime will not be \nquoted or traded on BMS. The Exempt Regime, provided for under Chapter 4B of the BMS \nListing Rules, has been available since December 2008 under a government initiative that \ntargets the listing of PDS and sukuk in conjunction with the development of the Malaysian \nbond market and the Malaysian International Islamic Finance Centre. \nThe Exempt Regime is specifically for issuers intending to list PDS or sukuk to obtain \nlisting status and for profiling purposes, and where the targeted investor group comprises \nSophisticated Investors, as defined under the Capital Market and Services Act, 2007 \n(CMSA). PDS or sukuk that are profile listed on the BMS Exempt Regime may be \ndenominated in a foreign currency (FCY) but must have an original maturity of more than \n1\u00a0year. The trading of PDS and sukuk under the Exempt Regime takes place in the OTC \nmarket and is inaccessible to retail investors.\nIn case of a profile listing under the BMS Exempt Regime, the issuer must observe the \ncontinuous disclosure requirements for material information specified in the BMS Listing \nRules, in addition to regulatory disclosure requirements. BMS acts as listing authority for all \nits listings and will take enforcement action in case of a breach.\nAt the same time, the issuer may choose to opt for a profile listing in another regional market \nin order to achieve listing status closer to the intended investor universe. This may be a \nconsideration, particularly if bonds, notes, or sukuk issued in Malaysia are to be marketed and \noffered to professional investors in other ASEAN+3 markets. In such cases, the professional \ninvestors would be able to obtain continuous disclosure information via the listing place and/or \nthat market\u2019s mechanisms for information dissemination.\nCurrency\nAMBIF\nIn the context of AMBIF, the denomination of an issue is generally expected to be in the \ndomestic currency of each ASEAN+3 market. But this does not exclude the possibility of \nissuing in other currencies if market practice regularly supports these other currencies, and \nthe relevant domestic currency or cash clearing capabilities exist. At this stage, US dollars, \nJapanese yen, and offshore Chinese renminbi are the currencies other than domestic \ncurrencies in which bonds and notes tend to be issued in ASEAN+3 markets.\nIn Malaysia\nIn addition to settlement for bonds, notes, and sukuk issued in Malaysian ringgit and offshore \nChinese renminbi, RENTAS is also able to settle bonds, notes, and sukuk denominated in US \ndollars through USD CHATS. A number of FCY-denominated bonds, notes, and sukuk have \nbeen issued in the Malaysian market. \nScope of Issuers\nAMBIF\nAs AMBIF is aimed at supporting the development of domestic bond markets in the region \nand promoting the intraregional recycling of funds, an issuer needs to be a resident of an \nASEAN+3 market. ", "AMBIF Implementation Guidelines for Malaysia 113\nIn Malaysia\nThe SC does not distinguish between resident and nonresident issuers of private debt \nsecurities in the applicable Lodge and Launch Guidelines, or between different types of \ncorporate issuers. All issuers are principally subject to the same requirements and obligations \nunder the Lodge and Launch Guidelines, and other applicable regulations. At the same time, \nsome concessions exist for FCY-denominated issuances, and exemptions are provided for \nmultilateral financial institutions and multilateral development banks.\nNonresident issuers issuing MYR-denominated bonds, notes, or sukuk, and resident issuers \nissuing FCY-denominated bonds, notes, or sukuk are subject to the Foreign Exchange \nAdministration (FEA) rules administered by BNM. \nDetails of the related approvals are provided in a later chapter.\nScope of Investors\nAMBIF\nProfessional investors are defined in accordance with regulations and/or market practice in \neach market in ASEAN+3. Some jurisdictions have a clear definition of professional investors \nwhile other jurisdictions may need to establish the concept through agreements. \nProfessional investors are institutions defined by law and licensed or otherwise registered \nwith regulators by law in their economy of domicile and, hence, are subject to governance \nand inspection based on securities market and/or prudential regulations. In addition, most of \nthem are also subject to oversight as well as professional conduct and best practice rules by a \nself-regulatory organization, such as an exchange or a market association. \nIn Malaysia\nThe issuance of bonds, notes, and sukuk to Sophisticated Investors\u2014under Schedules 6, 7, \nand 9 of the CMSA\u2014constitutes the professional bond market in Malaysia. The descriptions \nof the regulatory processes in this document are for the issuance of bonds, notes, and sukuk \noffered to Sophisticated Investors only.\nAs promulgated in the Lodge and Launch Guidelines issued in March 2015, Sophisticated \nInvestors refer to any person specified under Schedule 1 of the Guidelines on Sales Practices \nof Unlisted Capital Market Products, 2013. \u201cSophisticated Investors\u201d is a collective term \nand\u00a0includes\n1.

At the same time, foreign investors who wish to invest in the Malaysian \nmarket tend to fall under the definitions and provisions for High Net Worth Entities and High \nNet Worth Individuals. There are many foreign institutional investors already investing in \nMalaysia and holding their assets with domestic custodian banks.\nProfessional investors who are residents in Malaysia may invest in overseas markets. But \ninvestments in FCY-denominated assets abroad by residents are subject to the prevailing \nFEA rules, and subject to review and approval by BNM.", "AMBIF Bond, Note,  \nand Sukuk Issuance: \nRelevant Features in Malaysia\nIn addition to the market features corresponding to the AMBIF Elements, a number of \ngeneral market features of AMBIF bond, note, and sukuk issuance to Sophisticated Investors \nin the Malaysian domestic bond market need to be considered, and are described in this \nchapter. \nGoverning Law and Jurisdiction \nGoverning law and the jurisdiction for specific service provisions in relation to a bond or note \nissuance may have relevance in the context of AMBIF, since potential issuers may consider \nissuing under the laws or jurisdiction of a country or market other than the place of issuance. \nThe choice of governing law or the contractual preferences of stakeholders can affect the \naccessibility to a specific investor universe that may otherwise not be accessible if a bond or \nnote were issued under the laws of the place of issuance. However, it is necessary to point \nout that laws related to bond and note issuance and settlement must be governed by the \nlaws and regulations of the place of issuance since AMBIF bonds and notes are domestic \nbonds and notes.\nMalaysian law permits the use of governing laws or jurisdictions other than Malaysian law \nin contracts, provided that such provisions do not contravene any existing laws of Malaysia. \nThe decision on the governing law and jurisdiction for bonds, notes, or sukuk issued to \nSophisticated Investors in Malaysia tends to be investor driven. The key question in the \nsetting of the underlying law is the enforcement in case of a dispute arising. For example, in \nthe case of a secured bond or note, regulations prescribe that the governing law must follow \nthe jurisdiction in which the underlying assets are located. In this manner, governing law and \njurisdiction provisions in bond, note, and sukuk issuance documentation follow the standard \npractices in common loan documents.\nIn the case of issuance of MYR-denominated bonds, notes, or sukuk in Malaysia, even in \ncases when the contracting parties choose a governing law other than Malaysian law for \nthe contract, it is expected that Malaysian law would prevail with respect to issuance- and \nsettlement-related matters.\nIn any case, the actual use of governing laws or jurisdictions other than those of Malaysia \nmay be subject to clarification or legal advice from a qualified law firm, as may be necessary.\nLanguage of Documentation and Disclosure Items\nIt is envisaged that most of the ASEAN+3 markets participating in AMBIF will be able to \naccept the use of a common document in English; however, some markets may require ", "116 Appendix 6\nthe submission of approval-related information in their prescribed format and in the local \nlanguage. In such cases, concessions from these regulatory authorities for a submission of \nrequired information in English, in addition to the local language and formats, may be sought.\nContracts; bond, note, and sukuk issuance documentation and disclosure items; and \nall applications, approvals, and correspondence with regulatory authorities and market \ninstitutions can be in English in Malaysia.\nCredit Rating\nIn principle, all bonds, notes, and sukuk issued in Malaysia and denominated in Malaysian \nringgit require a credit rating from a credit rating agency approved by the SC.\nUnder the Lodge and Launch Guidelines (Chapter 2), FCY-denominated issuances do not \nrequire a credit rating. Since August 2014, the SC has given issuers the flexibility not to have \nMYR-denominated issuances aimed at Sophisticated Investors rated, but this concession \ncomes with the limitation that such PDS and sukuk cannot be traded for at least 2 years.\nThe complete removal of the mandatory credit rating requirements for bonds, notes, and \nsukuk issued in the Malaysian market will take effect in 2017.\nAlthough international ratings are accepted, domestic investors seem to favor a domestic \ncredit rating for MYR-denominated bonds, notes, and sukuk. The credit rating of a bond, \nnote, or sukuk issue must be made available to the SC upon an application to issue, offer, or \ninvite to subscribe or purchase PDS or sukuk.\nAt present, domestic credit ratings are available from Malaysian Rating Corporation \n(MARC) and RAM Holdings (RAM), formerly Rating Agency Malaysia. Both MARC and \nRAM are registered with the SC, pursuant to the Guidelines on Registration of Credit Rating \nAgencies,\u00a02011. \nSelling and Transfer Restrictions\nSelling and transfer restrictions for bonds, notes, and sukuk intended for professional \ninvestors (Sophisticated Investors) only are well defined in Malaysia, and are expressed and \nobserved through a number of regulations and practices in the market.\nPrior to issuance, the issuer or its agents are required to make explicit reference to Schedules \n6, 7, and 9 of the CMSA in all offer documents and related correspondence to Sophisticated \nInvestors, including the PTC of a proposed bond, note, or sukuk issuance to Sophisticated \nInvestors. A similar reference, to Schedules 6 and 9 of the CMSA only, will have to be present \nin all documentation and disclosure items after the bond, note, or sukuk issuance.\nAt the same time, the marketing or offers for sale and distribution of bonds, notes, and sukuk \naimed at Sophisticated Investors may only be undertaken by Malaysian legal entities with \na Capital Market Services License, or holders of a Capital Market Services Representative\u2019s \nLicense, regardless of (i) whether the bonds, notes, or sukuk were issued by domestic or \nforeign issuers; and (ii) where the bonds, notes, or sukuk were originally issued. This license \nis awarded by the SC to eligible institutions and individual dealers. Licensing requirements ", "AMBIF Implementation Guidelines for Malaysia 117\ninclude the commitment of the institution and individual holders to observe any applicable \nselling restrictions.\nA bond, note, or sukuk listed for profiling under the BMS Exempt Regime, by its nature, would \nbe limited to Sophisticated Investors at issuance or in secondary market transactions. These \nlimitations would also need to be observed by transaction intermediaries or Capital Market \nServices License holders, as per the prevailing regulations.\nNote Issuance Programs\nAMBIF promotes the use of note issuance programs, such as the medium-term note (MTN) \nformat, because they not only give funding flexibility to issuers but also represent the most \ncommon format of bond and note issuance in the international bond market. This means \nthat potential issuers, as well as investors and intermediaries, are likely to be familiar with \nnote issuance programs and related practices. Hence, this would make AMBIF comparable \nto the relevant practices in the international bond market. At the same time, it is expected \nthat potential issuers may benefit from reusing or adopting existing documentation or \ninformation on disclosure items.\nNote issuance programs are well established and widely accepted in the Malaysian market. \nIn addition to MTN programs for bonds and notes, the market also features Islamic MTN \nprograms for the issuance of sukuk.\nIn the Lodge and Launch Guidelines published in March 2015, note issuance programs are \nreferred to as \u201cdebt programmes,\u201d with the same meaning as described above.2\nIssuance and Trading Platforms for Bonds, Notes, and Sukuk\nThe Fully Automated System for Issuing/Tendering (FAST) is a system designed to facilitate \nthe primary issuance of all debt securities, including sukuk, and money market instruments \napproved by BNM and/or relevant authorities that are either issued via tender or on a private \nplacement basis. \nFAST also provides the following information via terminal access for its members:\n1.  daily indicative yield to maturity for government and BNM papers,\n2.  weekly indicative yield to maturity for PDS, and\n3.  Malaysian Government Securities indicative prices.\nThe Electronic Trading Platform (ETP) is an electronic trade reporting and trading platform \nfor the domestic bond market, and operated by Bursa Malaysia Bonds (Bursa Bonds). \nAmong other features, the ETP provides the following facilities: \n1.  mandatory reporting of all secondary bond market transactions;\n2.  an electronic order matching platform for the matching of bid and ask quotes for \nMalaysian Government Securities, Government Investment Issues, and corporate \nissues; and\n2  Securities Commission Malaysia. Lodge and Launch Framework. http://www.sc.com.my/legislation \n-guidelines/lodge-and-launch-framework/", "118 Appendix 6\n3.  an advertisement and a negotiation platform where dealers can advertise and \nnegotiate for one-to-one deals for all debt securities and sukuk.\nAny person may apply to Bursa Bonds to access information on the ETP. Membership to \ndeal securities on the ETP is open only to money brokers and applicants registered for the \npurpose of dealing in debt securities. The ETP interfaces with FAST.\nInformation Dissemination and Reference Pricing via BPAM\nAt the same time, BPAM captures, calculates, and makes available reference pricing for all \nbonds, notes, and sukuk issued and traded in the Malaysian market, regardless whether OTC \nor on exchange. This includes pricing to maturity and information on these bonds, notes, \nand sukuk, often including issuance documentation and disclosure items. BPAM pricing data \nare available to the public via its website and are disseminated to securities data vendors \nand subscribers in customized formats. Non-market participants, such as foreign investors, \ntypically obtain Malaysian bond, note, and sukuk information via BPAM.\nBond Trustee and Trust Deed\nThe SC prescribes the use of a trust deed\u2014and appointment of a bond trustee\u2014for a bond, \nnote, or sukuk issuance, in accordance with underlying provisions in the CMSA, Sections \n258ff. Certain exceptions to this requirement exist, such as when the bond, note, or sukuk \nissuance is offered exclusively to foreign investors or other entities specifically mentioned in \nSchedule 8 of the CMSA.\nThe bond trustee is to be appointed by the Principal Adviser.\nThe need for a trust deed is prescribed by the SC in Chapter 2 (Trust Deed and Trustee) of \nthe Lodge and Launch Guidelines. At the same time, the minimum content requirements of \nthe trust deed are detailed separately in the Guidelines on Trust Deeds, 2011.\nBond trustees must be registered with the SC, and are licensed trust companies or public \ncompanies.

There are no distinctions in the \nprocess under the Lodge and Launch Framework for particular corporate issuer types. The \nonly notable distinction is that issuers qualifying as multilateral development banks are \nrequired to lodge the required information directly with the SC, without the involvement of a \nPrincipal Adviser.\nForeign issuers intending to issue MYR-denominated bonds, notes, or sukuk aimed at \nSophisticated Investors require prior approval from BNM under the FEA rules. BNM also \nneeds to approve the issuances by resident issuers of FCY-denominated bonds, notes, \nor\u00a0sukuk.\nDetails of the individual regulatory processes are further explained in this section.\nTable A6.2 provides an overview of these regulatory processes by corporate issuer type. In \norder to make the issuance processes by issuer type more comparable across ASEAN+3 \nmarkets, the table features common issuer type distinctions that are evident in regional \nmarkets. Not all markets will distinguish all such issuer types.\nRegulatory Process Map: Overview\nThe regulatory process map may help with the navigation of the applicable regulatory \nprocesses to be applied to a given proposed bond, note, or sukuk issuance (Figure\u00a0A6.1).\nIn the Malaysian market, issuers of proposed bonds, notes, or sukuk are required to appoint \nan underwriter, officially referred to as a Principal Adviser, in applicable regulations. \nA\u00a0Principal Adviser needs to be registered with the SC.\n3  The official term for PDS in the CMSA is debentures.", "120 Appendix 6\nTable A6.2: Regulatory Processes by Corporate Issuer Type\nType of Corporate Issuer SC BNM BMS\nResident issuer\n\u2003Resident nonfinancial institution X1\n\u2003Resident financial institution\nO X\n\u2003Resident issuing FCY-denominated bonds, notes,  \nX2\n\u2003and sukuk\nNonresident issuer\n\u2003Nonresident nonfinancial institution X\n\u2003Nonresident financial institution X\nO X\n\u2003Nonresident issuing FCY-denominated bonds,  \n\u2003notes, and sukuk\nBMS = Bursa Malaysia Securities, BNM = Bank Negara Malaysia, FCY = foreign currency, SC = Securities \nCommission Malaysia.\nNotes: O indicates the need to lodge information and documents only; X indicates approval required.\n1  BNM approval required only if nontradable private debt securities are issued to nonresidents.\n2  BNM approval required under specific circumstances only; please refer to Chapter III.\nSource: ABMF SF1.\nFigure A6.1: Regulatory Process Map: Overview\nIssuer\nPrincipal Adviser Approval\nPost-\nIssuance\nNotice Request for\nYes\nApproval\nForeign \nIssuer?\nListing  Request for BNM\nApplication  FCY by  Yes Approval\nResident \nand Approval\nIssuer?\n(optional) No, or already  \nBNM approved \nLodgement of Issuance\nDocumentation/Disclosure\nSC\nBMS (Exempt Regime)\nBMS = Bursa Malaysia Securities, BNM = Bank Negara Malaysia, FCY = foreign currency (FCY-denominated \ndebt securities or sukuk), SC = Securities Commission Malaysia.\nSource: ABMF SF1.", "AMBIF Implementation Guidelines for Malaysia 121\nAn issuer of bonds, notes, or sukuk is expected to lodge or submit, respectively, all approval-\nrelevant information and necessary documents to the regulatory authorities via the Principal \nAdviser.

Sovereign issuers are not covered in this section.\nIssuance Process for Resident Issuer (Nonfinancial and Financial Institutions)\nSince 15 June 2015, issuers have been able to issue bonds, notes, or sukuk aimed at \nSophisticated Investors once they have lodged the required documents and information \nwith the SC. A formal approval from the SC is not required, provided all documentation \nand disclosure requirements (specified in the Lodgement Kit, a supplement to the Lodge \nand Launch Guidelines) have been observed. The lodgement of necessary documents and \ninformation is to be done electronically, via the SC\u2019s dedicated Online Submission System.\nThe provisions of the Lodge and Launch Framework are also applicable for PDS and sukuk \nissued in Malaysia and offered only to investors outside Malaysia.\nFigure A6.2 illustrates the straightforward process for bond, note, or sukuk issuance for a \nresident issuer under the Lodge and Launch Framework in Malaysia.\nIf a resident issuer intends to issue nontradable PDS or sukuk to nonresident investors \nonly, then additional, prior approval from BNM would need to be obtained. The process of \nissuance approval from BNM is comparable to the corresponding approval described below.\nThe following steps will need to be observed when a resident issuer wants to issue bonds, \nnotes, or sukuk to Sophisticated Investors under the Lodge and Launch Framework. \nStep 1: Online Submission to SC (Lodgement)\nIn the case of sukuk intended to be issued under the Lodge and Launch Framework, prior \napproval from the SC\u2019s Islamic Capital Market Department is required, on the Shariah \naspects of the sukuk, before a lodgement may be done.\nThe lodgement is to be completed by the issuer (in the case of a multilateral development \nbank) or the Principal Adviser. This role is designated as the Lodgement Party. There \nmust be a Lodgement Party at all times during the lifecycle of PDS or sukuk issued under \nthis\u00a0framework.\nThe Lodgement Party is required to identify other Responsible Parties, which are the \nparties involved in the issuance, and their roles and responsibilities in the context of the \nproduct\u00a0issuance.", "122 Appendix 6\nFigure A6.2: Regulatory Process: Issuance of Bonds, Notes,  \nor Sukuk by Resident Issuer \nIssuer\n2 \u2013 Launch Sophisticated \nPrincipal Adviser\nInvestors\n3 \u2013 Post-\nIssuance 1 \u2013 Lodgement of Issuance \nNotice Documentation/Disclosure\nSC\n5 \u2013 Listing  4 \u2013 Listing \nApproval Application\nBMS (Exempt Regime)\nOptional Process\nBMS = Bursa Malaysia Securities, SC = Securities Commission Malaysia.\nSource: ABMF SF1.\nPart 3, Section 1 of the Lodgement Kit lays out the detailed information requirements to be \nlodged, as listed for easy reference below.4 Depending on the nature of an instrument, not all \nrequirements may be applicable for all lodgements:\n1.  name; \n2.  date of incorporation; \n3.  place of incorporation; \n4.  business registration number; \n5.  residence status; \n6.  place of listing, if applicable; \n7.  date of listing, if applicable; \n8.  state if the issuer is a Malaysian government-linked company; \n9.  industry sector of the issuer; \n10.  principal activities; \n11.  principal activities of issuer\u2019s subsidiaries, where applicable; \n12.  if the issuer is a special purpose vehicle company (SPV), state the name of the entity \nthat established it; \n4  Information provided is current at the time of publication.

For sukuk, the \ninitial lodgement is prescribed to be done at least 10 business days prior to the targeted \nlaunch date, since it involves the approval of the Shariah aspects of the sukuk prior to the \nacceptance of the lodgement by the SC. \nEach lodgement much be accompanied by the relevant fees prescribed by the SC.\nAny revision to the documents or disclosure information after an initial lodgement but \nprior to the launch would result in the need to resubmit the full set of documentation and \ndisclosure information, and the timeline would reset.\nStep 2: Launch of Product under the Lodge and Launch Framework\nUnder the Lodge and Launch Framework, no formal approval for the issuance of debt \ninstruments or sukuk is required from the SC.

This \nincludes any issuance, publication or release of any information, notice, or advertisement \nwith respect to any of the activities specified above.\nThe debt securities and sukuk must be launched within 60 business days from lodgement \ndate; otherwise, the launch authorization will be null and void, and another lodgement would \nhave to be made. In the case of a debt or sukuk program, the first issuance under the program \nmust be launched within 60 business days.\nThe ability to launch PDS and sukuk commences after the fee payment to the SC has cleared.\nStep 3: Submission of Post-Issuance Notice to the SC\nUnder the Lodge and Launch Framework, the Lodgement Party (issuer) must submit a \npost-issuance notice, as prescribed in the Lodgement Kit, to the SC within 7 business days \nfrom the date of issuance. In the case of a debt or sukuk program, the submission of a post-\nissuance notice would apply to each issuance under the program.\nThe contents requirements for the post-issuance notice are prescribed in the Lodgement \nKit, Part 3, Section 2, and include\n1.

In the case \nof a sukuk, the Lodgement Party will also need to attach any necessary confirmation by the \nShariah Adviser under the regulations.\nThe issuer must also update the SC of any revision to the principal terms and conditions \nafter issuance through the Lodgement Party within 14 business days of the proposed revision \ncoming into effect. Such update must follow specific information and format requirements \nstipulated in Appendix 4 of the Lodge and Launch Guidelines.", "AMBIF Implementation Guidelines for Malaysia 127\nIn addition, the issuer must ensure that the actual utilization of proceeds is consistent with \nthe proposed use of proceeds advised at the time of lodgement.\nStep 4: Listing Application to Bursa Malaysia Securities (Optional)\nIn the event an issuer wishes to list its bonds, notes, or sukuk for profiling in Malaysia, BMS \noffers the Exempt Regime listing feature. \nIssuers already listed as entities on BMS, as well as nonlisted entities, may list bonds, notes, \nor sukuk under the BMS Exempt Regime. An issuer may submit an application before or after \nthe issuance of the bonds, notes, or sukuk. For a pre-issuance submission, an issuer may \nsubmit its listing application to BMS at the same time it lodges its documentation with the \nSC under the requirements of the Lodge and Launch Framework. However, BMS approval \nfor listing, if granted, will be conditional upon the ability to actually launch products under \nthe\u00a0framework.\nAny issuer intending to list under the BMS Exempt Regime will need to submit, through their \nPrincipal Adviser, a Listing Application, accompanied by the prescribed documentation and \ndisclosure items.\nThe Exempt Regime market-specific documentation and initial disclosure requirements, \nwhich differ significantly from the requirements for retail offers on the BMS main board, need \nto be observed when submitting the application. These requirements are defined in Chapter \n4B of the BMS Listing Rules, as well as in Part B of BMS Practice Note 26-A.\nBMS charges initial and annual listing fees, as per the prevailing tariff in the Listing Rules and \nrelated conditions, which are accessible via its website. (For a link, please refer to Attachment 1.)\nStep 5: Listing Approval from BMS\nBMS will check the listing application, following the submission of the relevant information \nin documentation and disclosure items. BMS may, at its discretion, request from the issuer or \nPrincipal Adviser supplementary information, if so required. BMS is committed to provide a \nresponse to a listing application to the issuer or Principal Adviser within 5 business days or\u00a0less.\nProvided that the information in the listing application and enclosed documents is in order \nand the review is satisfactory, BMS will issue an approval letter to the issuer or Principal \nAdviser, indicating that the listing has been approved, or state any conditions that may apply. \nThe listing approval from BMS does not have an expiry date, since the listing becomes \neffective once approved. \nIssuance Process for Nonresident Issuer\nA nonresident issuer must obtain approval from BNM before issuing MYR-denominated \nbonds, notes, or sukuk in Malaysia. There are no quotas or allocation of issuance amounts for \nnonresident issuers.\nThe following steps need to be observed when a nonresident issuer wants to issue bonds, \nnotes, or sukuk to Sophisticated Investors under the Lodge and Launch Framework \n(Figure\u00a0A6.3).", "128 Appendix 6\nFigure A6.3: Regulatory Process: Issuance by Nonresident Issuer in Local Currency\nNonresident Issuer 4 \u2013 Launch Sophisticated \nInvestors\nPrincipal Adviser\n2 \u2013 Approval 1 \u2013 Request for Approval \nBNM\n5 \u2013 Post-\nIssuance 3\u2013Lodgement of Issuance\nNotice Documentation/Disclosure\n7 \u2013 Listing  6 \u2013 Listing SC\nApproval Application\nBMS (Exempt Regime)\nOptional Process\nBMS = Bursa Malaysia Securities, BNM = Bank Negara Malaysia, SC = Securities Commission Malaysia.\nSource: ABMF SF1.\nStep 1: Submission of Application for Approval to BNM\nThe nonresident issuer or the Principal Adviser to the nonresident issuer of a MYR-\ndenominated bond, note, or sukuk to be issued in Malaysia will need to submit an application \nfor approval to the Foreign Exchange Administration Department at BNM.\nThe detailed information requirements for the application are laid out in the Appendix of the \nJoint Information Note on the Issuance and Subscription of Ringgit and Foreign Currency-\nDenominated Sukuk and Bonds in Malaysia, issued in July 2013 by both BNM and the SC, \nand are listed here for reference:5\n1.  profile of the issuer (e.g., business activities, country of incorporation, shareholders, \nboard of directors, financial report); \n2.  credit rating of issuer and name of credit rating agency (credit rating report); \n3.  type of sukuk or bonds; \n4.  size of issuance; \n5.  currency of issuance; \n6.  tenure; \n7.  benchmark or interest rate (e.g., fixed or floating) and frequency; \n8.  utilization of proceeds;\n5  Information provided is current at time of publication.

The approval letter contains a number of standard \nconditions referencing applicable laws and regulations.\nThe issuer is required to obtain approval from the SC for the issuance of PDS or sukuk \nwithin 2 years of the BNM approval. SC approval in the context of the issuance of PDS and \nsukuk to Sophisticated Investors refers to the issuer having successfully lodged the required \ninformation and disclosure items with the SC, and being able to launch the underlying \nproduct as a result.\nThe issuer may use the local currency proceeds from the bond, note, or sukuk issuance \nin Malaysia, or swap the proceeds into foreign currency. The swap arrangement must be \nundertaken with a licensed onshore bank, or back-to-back with a\u00a0licensed onshore bank in \nMalaysia.

See Figure A6.4 for reference.\nHowever, should the resident issuer wish to issue FCY-denominated bonds, notes, or sukuk \nto nonresident (professional) investors exceeding the prudential limit on FCY borrowing \nfrom nonresidents, the issuer will need to seek approval from BNM.\nIn such cases, the regulatory process follows the description of the issuance approval \ndescribed above and in Figure A6.5.

QB bond issuance, together with enrollment on Philippine \nDealing and Exchange (PDEx), is presently deemed to best represent the intentions of the \nAMBIF Elements. \nTable A7.1 identifies the features or practices of the domestic bond market in the Philippines \nthat directly correspond or are equivalent to the key elements of AMBIF.\nDescription of AMBIF Elements and Equivalent Features  \nin the Philippines\nDomestic Settlement \nAMBIF\nAMBIF is aimed at supporting the domestic bond markets in ASEAN+3. To be recognized \nas a domestic bond or note, an AMBIF bond or note needs to be settled at the designated \ncentral securities depository. Hence, domestic settlement needs to be a key feature of an \nAMBIF bond or note.\nIn the Philippines\nThe Philippine Depository & Trust Corp. (PDTC) is the designated central depository for \nequities and corporate bonds and notes. With the exception of a number of corporate notes \nthat are not listed on PDEx, PDTC settles and provides safekeeping for all fixed-income \ninstruments traded on PDEx. Both entities are subsidiaries of Philippine Dealing System \nHoldings (PDS).\n1  ASEAN+3 refers to the 10 members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) plus \nthe People\u2019s Republic of China, Japan, and the Republic of Korea.", "138 Appendix 7\nTable A7.1: AMBIF Elements and Equivalent Features in the Philippines\nAMBIF Elements Brief Description Equivalent in the Philippines \nDomestic Settlement Bonds and notes are settled at a national CSD in  PDTC as depository and place of settlement \nASEAN+3 markets. for all eligible bonds and notes\nHarmonized Documents  A common approach of submitting information  Single Submission Form is acceptable but \nfor Submission (Single  as input for regulatory process(es) where  additional information and document(s) may \nSubmission Form) approval or consent is required.

Hence, the Single Submission Form (SSF) that can \nbe applied to all of the relevant regulatory processes for bond and note issuance across \nmarkets was proposed. The information contained in the SSF can be submitted to all relevant \nregulatory authorities and market institutions for relevant approvals or consent, or used \nin the context of the submission (e.g., as a checklist), in anticipation of an AMBIF bond or \nnote\u00a0issuance.\nIn the Philippines\nIn the Philippines, the regulatory authorities and market institutions are expected to accept \nthe SSF, though this would not preclude the possibility for additional information to be \nsubmitted to the authorities, if so deemed necessary. ", "AMBIF Implementation Guidelines for the Philippines 139\nThe use of English is prescribed in Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) and Securities and \nExchange Commission (SEC) regulations, including the provisions related to PDEx.\nRegistration or Profile Listing in ASEAN+3 (Place of Continuous Disclosure)\nAMBIF\nInformation on issuers, bonds, and notes needs to be disclosed continuously in ASEAN+3 \nmarkets. A registration or listing authority function to facilitate the continuous disclosure is \nrequired. This can ensure the quality of disclosure and help create a well-organized market \nfor AMBIF issuances with transparency and a quality of information that would differentiate \nAMBIF issuances from ordinary private placements for which information is often neither \navailable nor guaranteed. Owing to this important feature, an AMBIF secondary market is \nexpected to emerge as the number of issuances increases. \nA profile listing is a listing without trading on an exchange. The objective of the listing is to \nmake bonds and notes visible and more information available to investors via a recognized \nlisting place, particularly those investors with more restrictive mandates, such as mutual and \npension funds. A profile listing at a designated listing place can ensure the flow of continuous \ndisclosure information and possibly even reference pricing in some markets. \nIn the Philippines\nIn the Philippines, the listing or enrollment of a bond or note on PDEx covers the listing or \nenrollment as well as trading processes and practices for debt instruments. According to \nPDEx Listing Rules (7.2.1), a listing or enrollment is possible for debt instruments issued by \nresident and nonresident issuers. A listing or enrollment of a note issuance program, such as \na medium-term note (MTN) program, is principally possible but has not yet been requested \nin applications to PDEx.\nA listing of a bond or note is for instruments open to all investors, and needs to be initiated \nby the issuer. In contrast, an enrollment is for bonds and notes aimed at Qualified Buyers \n(professional investors) only and may be initiated by the issuer or a trading participant; the \nparty who enrolls a bond or note on PDEx, also referred to as the sponsor, is responsible for \nthe disclosure of material information as stipulated in the PDEx Listing Rules.\nA listing or enrollment of a bond or note on PDEx does not automatically require trading. \nHowever, should the issuer or sponsor of a bond or note enrolled on PDEx wish to trade \nthe instrument, all trades must be done on PDEx. According to the Rules Governing the \nOver-the-Counter Market (OTC Rules) issued by the SEC in 2006, all OTC trading of debt \ninstruments issued in the Philippines needs to occur in an SEC-authorized marketplace. \nPDEx is such an authorized marketplace. Hence, the listing or enrollment is a necessary step \nto ultimately trade a bond or note in the OTC market in the Philippines. \nAt the same time, PDEx also principally offers the feature of profile listing in the form of the \nso-called Qualified Board, which takes its name from its designation to enroll (by the issuer) \nonly bonds or notes issued to professional investors. \nUnder the OTC Rules, the SEC conferred listing authority functions on PDEx. The PDEx \nListing Rules compel the continuous disclosure of material information from issuers or \nsponsors of a bond or note listed or enrolled on PDEx. PDEx also publishes bond pricing \ninformation based on actual traded prices that have to be captured by deal parties within \n1\u00a0minute of deal closure and reported in the Central Trade Reporting System within \n15\u00a0minutes, as provided under Section 16 of the OTC Rules.", "140 Appendix 7\nIn addition, or as an alternative, the issuer may opt for a profile listing in another regional \nmarket in order to achieve listing status closer to an intended investor universe. This may be \na consideration particularly if bonds or notes issued in the Philippines will be marketed and \noffered to professional investors in other ASEAN+3 markets. In such cases, the professional \ninvestor would be able to obtain continuous disclosure information via the listing place and/or \nthat market\u2019s mechanisms for information dissemination.\nCurrency\nAMBIF\nIn the context of AMBIF, the denomination of an issue is generally expected to be in the \ndomestic currency of each ASEAN+3 market. But this does not exclude the possibility of \nissuing in other currencies if market practice regularly supports the other currencies and \nthe relevant domestic currency or cash clearing capabilities exist. At this stage, US dollars, \nJapanese yen, and offshore Chinese renminbi are the currencies other than domestic \ncurrencies in which bonds and notes tend to be issued in ASEAN+3\u00a0markets.\nIn the Philippines\nIn addition to settlement for bonds and notes issued in Philippine pesos, PDTC is also able \nto settle bonds and notes denominated in US dollars that are registered in the Philippines \nand listed on PDEx, as the Philippines features a domestic US dollar clearing system. In \nthe past few years, PDEx has listed a number of USD-denominated bonds issued by the \nPhilippine\u00a0government.\nScope of Issuers\nAMBIF\nAs AMBIF is aimed at supporting the development of domestic bond markets in the region \nand promoting the intraregional recycling of funds, an issuer needs to be a resident of an \nASEAN+3 market. \nIn the Philippines\nThe SEC does not differentiate between resident and nonresident issuers. All potential \nissuers need to file a Notice of Exempt Transaction with the SEC for the planned issuance of \nbonds or notes aimed at Qualified Buyers.\nNonresident issuers wishing to use the proceeds from a PHP-denominated bond or note in \na foreign currency may require a policy decision by the SEC prior to filing a Notice of Exempt \nTransaction, which is described in more detail later in this document..\nAs for the purview of the BSP, rules applied on the issuance of bonds or notes may vary \ndepending on whether the issuer is a resident or nonresident, and whether the bonds or \nnotes are denominated in Philippine pesos or a foreign currency. In addition, if the issuer is a \nfinancial institution, other prudential considerations may apply. \nFor resident nonfinancial institution issuers, no prior BSP approval is required if bonds \nor notes and other similar instruments are denominated in pesos. For resident financial \ninstitution issuers, the issuance of bonds and notes denominated in pesos is allowed, \nsubject to regulations governing the borrowing of banks under the provisions of the \nManual of Regulations for Banks (MORB). However, if bonds or notes are denominated ", "AMBIF Implementation Guidelines for the Philippines 141\nin a foreign currency, prior approval is required for resident issuers (both financial and \nnonfinancial institutions). \nTable A7.2: Overview of BSP Approvals for the Issuance of Bonds and Notes by Issuer Type\nCurrency of Bond or Note Issuance\nIssuer\nPhilippine Peso Foreign Currency\nResident nonfinancial  No prior BSP approval required\ninstitution\nSubject to BSP approval prior to \nResident financial institution Subject to regulations on the \nexecution of transaction\nborrowing of banks under the \nManual of Regulations for Banks\nNonresident nonfinancial \ninstitution\nSubject to BSP approval prior to execution of transaction\nNonresident financial \ninstitution\nSource: Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP).\nFor nonresident issuers, the issuance of bonds and notes or similar instruments (regardless \nof currency of denomination) requires BSP approval before execution of the transaction. \nTable\u00a0A7.2 gives an overview of these approval criteria for easy reference.\nBoth resident and nonresident issuers may list or enroll their debt instruments aimed at \nQualified Buyers on PDEx, depending on the SEC framework. For more details on PDEx and the \nregulatory processes of the BSP and SEC, please refer to the other chapters in this document.\nScope of Investors\nAMBIF\nProfessional investors are defined in accordance with regulations and/or market practice in \neach market in ASEAN+3. Some jurisdictions have a clear definition of professional investors, \nwhile other jurisdictions may need to establish the concept through agreements. \nProfessional investors are institutions defined by law and licensed or otherwise registered \nwith regulators by law in their economy of domicile and, hence, are subject to governance \nand inspection based on securities market and/or prudential regulations. In addition, most of \nthem are also subject to oversight as well as professional conduct and best practice rules by a \nby a self-regulatory organization, such as an exchange or a market association. \nIn the Philippines\nIn the Philippines, the Securities Regulation Code (SRC), Section 10.1 describes professional \ninvestors as Qualified Buyers. Concessions on disclosure and obligations under the Qualified \nBuyer concept are prescribed in this section. At this point in time, the issuance of bonds or \nnotes to Qualified Buyers, generally referred to as QB bonds, constitutes the professional \nbond market in the Philippines. The descriptions of regulatory processes included in this \ndocument are for QB bond issuance only.", "142 Appendix 7\nThe SRC deals with so-called Exempt Transactions\u2014circumstances under which concessions \nfrom the full disclosure and approval processes of the SEC are available. Section 10.1 (l) \nprescribes exemptions from full disclosure and the related approval process when issuing \nbonds or notes to the following institutions, thereby decreeing them as professional investors:\n1.  banks;\n2.  registered investment houses;\n3.  insurance companies;\n4.  pension funds, retirement schemes, and BSP authorized trusts;\n5.  investment companies; and\n6.  other institutions as determined by the SEC.\nThere is no distinction in the SRC, or in the SEC\u2019s Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR), \nbetween domestic and foreign professional investors. \nFor investments in bonds or notes issued domestically, the following BSP rules shall apply:\n1.  In cases of investments in PHP-denominated bonds and notes issued by residents:\na.  investments by residents may be done without BSP approval; and\nb.  investments by nonresidents may, likewise, be done without prior BSP approval, \nsubject to registration only if the foreign exchange (FX) to service repatriation \nof capital and related earnings will be sourced from the authorized agent banks \nand/or the banks\u2019 FX corps.\n2.  In cases of investments in PHP-denominated bonds and notes issued by non-\nresidents:\na.  investments by residents may be done without BSP approval; and\nb.  investments by nonresidents are not expressly allowed under existing rules; \nthus, prior BSP approval is required.\n3.  In cases of investments in FCY-denominated bonds and notes issued domestically \nby residents:\na.  investments by residents are not allowed under existing rules since transactions \nin FX between nonfinancial institutions are prohibited if FX comes from the \nbanking system; and\nb.  investments by nonresidents may be done without BSP approval.\n4.

The choice of governing law or contractual preferences of stakeholders can affect \nthe accessibility to a specific investor universe that may otherwise not be accessible if a bond \nor note was issued under the laws of the place of issuance. However, it is necessary to point \nout that provisions related to bond and note issuance and settlement must be governed by \nthe laws and regulations of the place of issuance since AMBIF bonds and notes are domestic \nbonds and notes.\nThe civil code of the Philippines permits the use of governing laws or jurisdictions other than \nthose in the Philippines in contracts, provided that such provisions do not contravene any \nexisting Philippine laws. \nShould the parties involved in a bond or note issuance choose to use Philippine law, the \njurisdiction of the issuance would fall to Philippine courts by default. If, in contrast, issuance \nparties agree on another governing law, the parties would also have to specifically determine \nthe jurisdiction of a court in which provisions of the bond or note issuance (e.g., settlement \nagency) could be enforced and any disputes would be heard and decided. \nIn the case of issuance of PHP-denominated bonds or notes in the Philippines, even in cases \nwhen contract parties choose a governing law other than Philippine law for the contract, it is \nexpected that Philippine law would prevail as the law specific to issuance- and settlement-\nrelated matters.\nIn any case, the actual use of governing laws or jurisdictions other than those of the \nPhilippines may be subject to clarification or legal advice from a qualified law firm, as may be \nnecessary.\nLanguage of Documentation and Disclosure Items\nIt is envisaged that most of the ASEAN+3 markets participating in AMBIF will be able to \naccept the use of a common document in English; however, some markets may require ", "AMBIF Implementation Guidelines for the Philippines 145\nthe submission of approval-related information in their prescribed format and in the local \nlanguage. In such cases, concessions from these regulatory authorities for a submission of \nrequired information in English, in addition to local language and formats, may be sought.\nIn the Philippines, English translation shall be used in all documentation with regard to the \nissuance of bonds or notes.  \nCredit Rating\nBonds and notes to be listed or enrolled on PDEx require a credit rating in line with the credit \nrating requirements stipulated by the SEC and BSP. \nIn its Memorandum Circular No. 7 released in March 2014, the SEC announced the \nGuidelines on the Accreditation, Operations and Reporting of Credit Rating Agencies, which \ngovern the two domestic credit rating agencies, Philippine Rating Services (PhilRatings) and \nCredit Rating and Investors Services Philippines, in addition to an acceptance of international \ncredit rating agencies.\nUnder BSP regulations, unsubordinated debt requires a rating of at least AA on the Philippine \ndomestic credit rating scale. PhilRatings is the first domestic credit rating agency to be \nrecognized by the BSP, based on minimum eligibility criteria for bank supervisory purposes. \nThe BSP also accepts credit ratings from Fitch Ratings, Moody\u2019s, and Standard & Poor\u2019s, \nas well as Fitch Singapore. PDEx accepts credit ratings from a credit rating agency duly \nrecognized by the applicable regulatory authorities.\nUnrated bonds and notes are possible under present regulations and may be listed on the \nPDEx Qualified Board; however, it has been observed that potential AMBIF investors may \nprefer for bonds and notes to have a credit rating. \nSelling and Transfer Restrictions\nSelling and transfer restrictions for the issuance of bonds or notes to professional investors \nare well defined in the identified professional market segment in the Philippines (Qualified \nBuyers and Qualified Securities).\nPursuant to SRC Sections 9 and 10, the IRR published by the SEC prescribe a template \nand specific provisions on the use of that template, and define the selling and/or transfer \nrestrictions when issuing bonds or notes to Qualified Buyers. \nTo further ensure that an exemption claimed by an issuer under Section 10.1 of the \nSRC when issuing bonds or notes aimed at Qualified Buyers, the SEC also looks to the \nunderwriter\u2014licensed by the SEC\u2014to observe the applicable provisions and selling and \ntransfer restrictions under the law.\nIn all offer documents and related correspondence to Qualified Buyers, including the term \nsheet of a proposed bond or note issue, an issuer must make explicit reference to SRC \nSection 10.1 (L) and give their commitment that said offer is limited to Qualified Buyers, \nthereby constituting an Exempt Transaction under the law. The IRR related to SRC Section \n10.1 (1.c) prescribe the following statement in bold face and prominent type:", "146 Appendix 7\nThe securities being offered or sold have not been registered \nwith the Securities and Exchange Commission under the \nSecurities Regulation Code, any future offer or sale thereof is \nsubject to registration requirements under the Code unless \nsuch offer or sale qualifies as an Exempt Transaction.\nIn addition, appropriate selling or transfer restrictions will need to be printed on the actual \nissued instrument, typically global or jumbo certificate(s) in bold font if certificates are \nto be issued. However, Philippine company law does not require the physical issuance \nof\u00a0certificates.\nIf a bond or note is listed or enrolled on PDEx, as discussed in Chapter I, the observance of \napplicable selling and transfer restrictions is part of the explicit warranties that issuers and \nparticipants give to PDEx when signing up. PDEx also requires all its listing or enrollments to \nbe dematerialized; hence, no certificates means that no explicit selling restrictions will need \nto be printed. \nThere are no distinctions between domestic issuers and nonresident issuers with regard to \nselling or transfer restrictions and their observance.\nNote Issuance Program\nAMBIF promotes the use of note issuance programs, such as the medium-term note (MTN) \nformat, because they not only give funding flexibility to issuers but also represent the most \ncommon format of bond and note issuance in the international bond market. This means \nthat potential issuers, as well as investors and intermediaries, are likely to be familiar with \nnote issuance programs and related practices. Hence, this would make AMBIF comparable \nto the relevant practices of the international bond market. At the same time, it is expected \nthat potential issuers may benefit from reusing or adopting existing documentation or \ninformation on disclosure items.\nAt this stage, the issuance of PHP-denominated domestic bonds and notes to professional \ninvestors via an MTN program is not evident in the Philippine market. However, a listing or \nenrollment on PDEx, for example, would be possible as USD-denominated note issuance \nprograms have been evident in the Philippines for some time. In addition, a shelf-registration \nconcept exists, though this is not directly comparable to shelf-registration concepts typically \npracticed in other markets.\nPrivate Placement\nA typical definition of a private placement is the issuance of bonds or notes to professional \ninvestors under exemptions or concessions from full disclosure or defined regulatory \nprocesses. In this context, bonds or notes aimed at Qualified Buyers (QB bonds), or those \nclassified as Exempt Transactions, typically fulfill the traditional expectations of a private \nplacement concept in which the target group is professional investors and the issue is \nsubject to exemption from full disclosure under applicable regulations and, in the case of the \nPhilippines, registration with the SEC.

For more details, please refer \nto the earlier chapters in this document. \nTable A7.4 provides an overview of these regulatory processes by corporate issuer type. In \norder to make the issuance processes by issuer type more comparable across ASEAN+3 \nmarkets, the table features common issuer type distinctions that are evident in regional \nmarkets. Not all markets will distinguish all such issuer types.

In contrast to the requirements for a \npublic offering, the regulatory processes for QB bond issuances are fairly streamlined.\nDistinctions are made according to the prescribed issuance processes for individual \ncorporate issuer types in the Philippines. Sovereign issuers are not covered in this section.\nIssuance Process for Resident Issuer (Other Than Financial Institution)\nA resident issuer is defined as a corporate legal entity under the laws of the Philippines. The \nregulatory process for issuance of QB bonds by a resident is presented in Figure A7.2.\nFigure A7.2: Regulatory Process: Issuance of QB Bonds by Resident Issuer \n4 \u2013 Effective  Resident Issuer\nListing\nUnderwriter\n3 \u2013 Approval \n1 \u2013 Notice of  \nExempt Transaction\nSEC\n2 \u2013 Application \nfor Listing\nPDEx\nPDEx = Philippine Dealing and Exchange, QB = Qualified Buyer, SEC = Securities and Exchange Commission.\nSource: ABMF SF1.\nThe following steps will need to be observed when a resident issuer wants to issue bonds or \nnotes to professional investors (QB issuances) in the Philippines. \nStep 1: Filing of a Notice of Exempt Transaction with the SEC\nThe issuer or underwriter of a bond or note aimed at professional investors (Qualified \nBuyers) in the Philippines will need to file a Notice of Exempt Transaction with the SEC. ", "152 Appendix 7\nIf the issuance of a bond or note is considered a repeat issue under a shelf-registration or \nother bond or note issuance program, a separate Notice of Exempt Transaction would not \nneed to be filed.\nThe SRC, Section 10.3 prescribes that, in order for an issuer to secure an exemption from the \nofficial registration of debt instruments with the SEC (public offer and full disclosure), an \nissuer must file a notice on which exemption under Section 10 is relied upon to qualify as an \nExempt Transaction. This process is called Filing of a Notice of Exempt Transaction.\nThe cover letter for the Filing of a Notice of Exempt Transaction is SEC Form 10.1. Further \ndetails are contained in the IRR of the SRC, the latest version of which came into effect in \nFebruary 2015. Since Form 10.1 is a physical format, a copy is included as Attachment 1 of the \nAMBIF Implementation Guidelines for the Philippines for easy reference. However, not all \nfields in Form 10.1 relate to a Notice of Exempt Transaction.\nThe issuer or its underwriter needs to file five copies of SEC Form 10.1 with the SEC, one of \nwhich needs to be manually signed by a duly authorized person who, in case of a juridical \nperson, shall be the president or equivalent in the jurisdiction of a nonresident issuer.\nThere is a fee charged for the Filing of a Notice of Exempt Transaction to the SEC.\nA cooling-off period of 2 business days from the Filing of a Notice of Exempt Transaction will \nneed to be observed before the issuer or their agent(s) may offer the bonds or notes for sale \nand commence to procure the listing of the bonds or notes simultaneously.\nIf a Notice of Exempt Transaction is filed with the SEC, the issuer has the burden of proof that \nthe bond or note issuance qualifies as an Exempt Transaction under Section 10 of the SRC \nthroughout the lifecycle of the bond or note. Under SRC Section 10 and its related IRR (6.1.), \nthe SEC has the right to challenge such exemption at any time. The SEC also has the right to \ndemand a certification, if necessary. \nTo further ensure compliance with the exemption claimed by an issuer under Section 10.1 of \nthe SRC, the SEC looks to the underwriter\u2014licensed by the SEC\u2014to observe the applicable \nprovisions and selling and transfer restrictions under the law.\nThe SEC has confirmed that the SSF may be used for the filing of the Notice of Exempt \nTransaction with the SEC, since the SSF was reviewed by the SEC and contains all relevant \ninformation required for the Filing of a Notice of Exempt Transaction, as detailed above.\nThe SEC will not issue a confirmation of the Notice of Exempt Transaction or an approval \nletter unless a certification is specifically requested by the issuer. Instead, the issuer and/or \nunderwriter may proceed with the bond or note issuance or offer for sale to Qualified Buyers \nfollowing a cooling-off period of 2 business days.\nStep 2: Application for Listing (or Enrollment) on PDEx\nFiling a Notice of Exempt Transaction with the SEC (Step 1) is a prerequisite for the \napplication for listing (or enrollment).\nFor a bond or note to be eligible to be traded in the Philippines, even in the OTC market, the \nissuer or underwriter of a bond or note aimed at professional investors (Qualified Buyers) \nwill need to list or enroll the bond or note on PDEx. The practice of listing or enrollment is ", "AMBIF Implementation Guidelines for the Philippines 153\nstipulated in the OTC rules by the SEC and regulated in the PDEx Listing Rules. (For more \ndetails, please refer to Chapter I.) At the same time, trading is not compulsory (e.g., in cases \nwhen professional investors buy and hold only specific bond or notes). \nA bond or note aimed at professional investors (Qualified Buyers) will need to be enrolled on \nPDEx. Enrollment is done by a sponsor, either the issuer or a trading participant. The sponsor \nis compelled to comply with the obligations to continuously disclose material information as \nmay be specified in applicable SEC rules and regulations and the PDEx Listing Rules.\nBoth listing and enrollment result in the same downstream clearing and settlement processes \nand practices in the Philippines. \nPDEx prescribes that an issuer or trading participant (for enrollment) needs to send to PDEx \nthe application for listing or enrollment as well as the duly executed listing agreement, together \nwith documents and disclosure items stipulated in the applicable PDEx listing checklist.\nPDEx may, at any time, request for additional information or disclosure items from the issuer.\nA fee is payable with the application; the PDEx schedule of fees for admitting securities \napplies to both listing and enrollment. \nStep 3: Approval from PDEx\nUpon a complete submission of the documentary requirements, and assuming that there are \nno identified issues, PDEx has a target time frame of responding to the application for listing \n(enrollment) within 5 business days. The actual review process commences when an issuer \nor listing applicant starts the submission of the documentary requirements. For resident \nissuers, this process typically begins as early as 3 weeks before a targeted listing date.\nIf all documents and disclosure items are in order, and the applicable (listing) fees have been \npaid, PDEx will issue an approval letter to the issuer. PDEx may state specific conditions \nattached to the approval, if necessary.\nStep 4: Effective Listing (Listing Exercise)\nFor the listing of the debt securities to take effect, PDEx has a target time frame of 3 business \ndays after an approval is issued, on the assumption that no concerns have been identified and \nthe required securities\u2019 details are complete and in order. PDEx Listing Rule 7.6.6 stipulates \nthat PDEx shall announce the admission of new debt securities to its trading participants and \nthe SEC, and publish the announcement on its website. A listing exercise shall likewise be held \nto formally and publicly announce the admission for secondary trading on the PDEx Trading \nPlatform and to commence the trading of such debt securities.   \nThe listing exercise is a brief ceremony held prior to the start of trading, highlighted by the \nringing of a ceremonial bell at 9 a.m. (the start of the trading day) by the issuer of the debt \nsecurities, to mark the start of trading of its newly listed debt securities on the trading platform.\nIssuance Process for Resident Financial Institution\nWhile the SEC is the principal regulatory authority for the securities market, the SRC, Section 9.1. (e) \nexempts debt securities issued by banks from the need to file a registration statement (or a \nNotice of Exempt Transaction from such registration statement) with the SEC. ", "154 Appendix 7\nIf the issuer is a resident financial institution in the Philippines (a BSP-supervised entity), \nthe issuance of bonds or notes, including to professional investors (Qualified Buyers) is \npermitted without approval (Figure A7.3).

There is no quota or allocation of issuance amounts in Philippine pesos for \nnonresident issuers.\nAccording to Section 31.3 of the BSP Manual of Regulations on Foreign Exchange \nTransactions, a bond or note issuance by a nonresident issuer requires the authorization of \nthe BSP for the nonresident issuer to access the domestic banking system in the Philippines \n(e.g., in the form of collection of issuance proceeds through underwriters, and activities in the \nforeign exchange or swap market).

Foreign governments and multilateral organizations are also eligible.\nIssuance Process for Nonresident Financial Institution\nThe process of issuance of bonds or notes to professional investors (Qualified Buyers) \nfor nonresident financial institutions is much the same as for other nonresident issuers \ndescribed above. However, part of the process of approval for a nonresident financial \ninstitution are the added requirements of the BSP\u2019s Financial Supervision Department under \nthe BSP\u2019s remit of governance of the activities of banks and other financial institutions in the \nPhilippines (Figure A7.5).\nThe steps described below need to be observed when a nonresident financial institution \nwants to issue bonds or notes to professional investors (Qualified Buyers) in the Philippines. \nAgain, the nonresident financial institution may file the request for approval with the BSP \nand the Notice of Exempt Transaction with the SEC at the same time.

For more details, please refer to Issuance \nProcess for Nonresident Issuer (Other Than Financial Institution).\nIssuance Process Specific to the Philippines  \nPossible Additional Process: Certification of QB Bond Eligibility by the SEC\nAlthough in principle this potential process would be a direct continuation of the Filing of \nNotice of Exempt Transaction described above, it should be seen as a distinctly separate \nstep in the overall regulatory process for the issuance of bonds or notes since it is an optional \nregulatory process and it carries a significant fee.\nThe function of the certification process is to confirm to the issuer and underwriter, and \npotential Qualified Buyers, intermediaries, and the market at large, the eligibility of the bonds \nor notes as an Exempt Transaction under the SEC, Section 10, and the reduced obligations \non the issuer and underwriter in terms of initial and continuous disclosure. In such cases, the \nissuer and/or underwriter no longer carry the burden of proof to stakeholders that the QB \nbond or note qualifies as such.\nThe process of certification by the SEC carries a fee, stipulated in the SRC, Section 10.3, \npresently calculated as \u201c\u2026one-tenth (1/10) of one percent (1%) of the maximum aggregate \nprice or issued value of the securities.\u201d3 This formula could amount to a substantial expense \nfor the issuer. However, the recent Financial Sector Neutrality Act may result in the fee being \nconverted to a flat amount, as is common in most other ASEAN+3 markets.

While the SGD-denominated bond market is relatively small, many bonds and notes \nare issued internationally in the Singapore market. Table A8.1 identifies the features and \npractices of the domestic bond market in Singapore that directly correspond with or are \nequivalent to the AMBIF Elements.\nDescription of AMBIF Elements and Equivalent Features in Singapore\nDomestic Settlement \nAMBIF\nAMBIF is aimed at supporting the domestic bond markets of ASEAN+3. To be recognized \nas a domestic bond or note, an AMBIF bond or note needs to be settled at the designated \ncentral securities depository (CSD). Hence, domestic settlement needs to be a key feature of \nan AMBIF bond or note.\nIn Singapore\nSGD-denominated corporate bonds and notes issued in the domestic market in Singapore \nare predominately cleared and settled at the Central Depository, a subsidiary of Singapore \nExchange (SGX), regardless whether these bonds and notes are traded over-the-counter \n(OTC) or on an exchange. \nHarmonized Documents for Submission (Single Submission Form)\nAMBIF\nBased on the review of application forms for issuance approval, offering circulars, \ninformation memorandums, and program information formats in ASEAN+3, the core \ninformation was similar or comparable across markets. Hence, the Single Submission \nForm (SSF) that can be applied to all of the relevant regulatory processes for bond and \nnote issuance across markets was proposed. The information contained in the SSF can \nbe submitted to all relevant regulatory authorities and market institutions for relevant \n1  ASEAN+3 refers to the 10 members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) plus \nthe People\u2019s Republic of China, Japan, and the Republic of Korea.", "AMBIF Implementation Guidelines for Singapore 169\nTable A8.1: AMBIF Elements and Equivalents in Singapore\nAMBIF Element Description Equivalent in Singapore \nDomestic Settlement Bonds and notes are settled at a national CSD in  Settlement of corporate bonds and notes by \nASEAN+3 markets the Central Depository \nHarmonized Documents  A common approach is of submitting  MAS approval is not required for the issuance \nfor Submission (Single  information as input for regulatory process(es)  of bonds and notes to professional investors \nSubmission Form) where approval or consent is required.  in Singapore; SGX is receptive to exploring \nAppropriate disclosure information along with  a single-submission-document process \nADRB recommendation needs to be included. that adheres to SGX\u2019s current bond listing \nrequirements and processes. \nRegistration or Profile  Information on bonds, notes, and issuers needs  Wholesale bonds market on SGX in cases \nListing in ASEAN+3  to be disclosed continuously in ASEAN+3  of profile listing; continuous obligations in \n(Place of Continuous  markets.   the form of corporate announcements on \nDisclosure) Registration or a listing authority function is  SGXNet are required.\nrequired to ensure continuous and quality \ndisclosure.\nCurrency The denomination of an issue is generally  All currencies\nexpected to be in the domestic currency of each \nASEAN+3 market.\nScope of Issuers Resident of ASEAN+3  No limitation on issuers\nScope of Investors Professional investors defined in accordance  Institutional Investors and Accredited \nwith applicable laws and regulations, or market  Investors, as defined under the Securities and \npractice, in each ASEAN+3 market Futures Act\nADRB = AMBIF Documentation Recommendation Board, AMBIF = ASEAN+3 Multi-Currency Bond Issuance Framework,  \nASEAN = Association of Southeast Asian Nations, ASEAN+3 = ASEAN plus the People\u2019s Republic of China, Japan, and the Republic of Korea, \nCSD = central securities depository, MAS = Monetary Authority of Singapore, SGX = Singapore Exchange.\nSource: ABMF SF1.\napprovals or consent, or used in the context of the submission (e.g., as a checklist) in \nanticipation of an AMBIF bond or note issuance.\nIn Singapore\nNo approval by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) is required for bond and note \nissuance to professional investors; thus, contracting parties\u2014such as issuers, underwriters, \nand investors\u2014are free to set and agree on documentation and disclosure requirements \namong themselves.\nTo be listed on SGX for profiling purposes, SGX is receptive to exploring a single-submission-\ndocuments process, as long as its application procedures and all listing requirements are \nfulfilled.\nEnglish is one of the official languages of Singapore; hence, the SSF can be utilized, \nparticularly in the context of a profile listing since no issuance approval is required.\nRegistration or Profile Listing in ASEAN+3 (Place of Continuous Disclosure)\nInformation on issuers, bonds, and notes needs to be disclosed continuously in ASEAN+3 \nmarkets. A registration or listing authority function to facilitate continuous disclosure is \nrequired. This can ensure the quality of disclosure and help create a well-organized market ", "170 Appendix 8\nfor AMBIF issuances with transparency and a quality of information that would differentiates \nAMBIF issuances from ordinary private placements for which information is often neither \navailable nor guaranteed. Owing to this important feature, an AMBIF secondary market is \nexpected to emerge as the number of issuances increases. \nA profile listing is a listing without trading on an exchange. The objective of the listing is to \nmake bonds and notes visible and more information available to investors via a recognized \nlisting place, particularly those investors with more restrictive mandates, such as mutual and \npension funds. A profile listing at a designated listing place can ensure the flow of continuous \ndisclosure information and possibly even reference pricing in some markets. \nIn Singapore\nSGX offers a profile listing feature on its Wholesale Bonds market for bonds and notes aimed \nat Institutional Investors and Accredited Investors under the provisions of the Securities \nand Futures Act (SFA). These bonds and notes are traded OTC and listed for profiling only, \ntypically in order to reach a specific investor universe or address the need for a listing in \npotential investors\u2019 mandated prudential regulations.\nPrices for OTC-traded bonds and notes are only available to the market through trading \nplatforms and data vendors. At present, there is no pricing agency in Singapore, and the \nregistration of a bond or note is not applicable in Singapore.\nSGX prescribes applicable documentation and disclosure items for listing on the Wholesale \nBonds market in its listing rules. Being the listing authority, SGX prescribes the continuous \ndisclosure of material information by an issuer listed on the Wholesale Bonds market via its \nSGXNet platform, in addition to the initial disclosure at time of listing. \nFor all intents and purposes, the listing of a bond or note on the SGX Wholesale Bonds \nmarket fulfills the AMBIF Element of Registration or Profile Listing.\nCurrency\nAMBIF\nIn the context of AMBIF, the denomination of an issue is generally expected to be in the \ndomestic currency of each ASEAN+3 market. But this does not exclude the possibility of \nissuing in other currencies if market practice regularly supports these other currencies and \nthe relevant domestic currency or cash clearing capabilities exist. At this stage, United States \ndollars, Japanese yen, and offshore Chinese renminbi are the currencies other than domestic \ncurrencies in which bonds and notes tend to be issued in ASEAN+3 markets. \nIn Singapore\nDomestic bonds and notes in the Singapore market are typically issued in Singapore dollars, \nbut can also be issued in a variety of other currencies. In addition to the local currency, \nclearing and settlement capabilities in Australian dollars, offshore renminbi, Hong Kong \ndollars, and US dollars exist in the Singapore market. Given the significance of the Singapore \nmarket, and the SGX Wholesale Bonds market in particular, bonds and notes issued in \nother ASEAN+3 currencies, with the exception of Singapore dollars and offshore Chinese \nrenminbi, would only be listed for profiling but effectively settled and safekept in their \nrespective home markets. \nThe SGX Wholesale Bonds market features listings for profiling in more than 20 currencies, \nincluding those from ASEAN+3 markets.  ", "AMBIF Implementation Guidelines for Singapore 171\nScope of Issuers\nAMBIF\nAs AMBIF is aimed at supporting the development of domestic bond markets in the region \nand promoting the intraregional recycling of funds, an issuer needs to be a resident of an \nASEAN+3 market. \nIn Singapore\nIn Singapore, regulations do not distinguish between domestic or foreign issuers for the \npurpose of issuing bonds or notes to professional investors. However, in cases of a non-\nresident financial institution issuing SGD-denominated bonds and notes, the issuer must \nswap or convert the proceeds to foreign currency, rather than remit the Singapore dollars \noutside of Singapore.2 \nFor the purpose of profile listing on the SGX Wholesale Bonds market, the distinction \nbetween domestic or foreign issuers is not significant; the guiding principles are that issuers \nmust qualify according to the listing eligibility criteria set out in the SGX Listing Rules, in \nparticular for the issuance of bonds and notes to professional investors.\nScope of Investors\nAMBIF\nProfessional investors are defined in accordance with regulations and/or market practice in \neach market in ASEAN+3. Some jurisdictions have a clear definition of professional investors, \nwhile other jurisdictions may need to establish the concept through agreements.  \nProfessional investors are institutions defined by law and licensed or otherwise registered \nwith regulators by law in their economy of domicile and, hence, are subject to governance \nand inspection based on securities market and/or prudential regulations. In addition, most of \nthem are also subject to oversight as well as professional conduct and best practice rules by a \nself-regulatory organization, such as an exchange or a market association. \nIn Singapore\nProfessional investors, interpreted as nonretail investors, are referred to as Accredited \nInvestors and Institutional Investors as defined in Section 4A of the SFA (Chapter 289 of \nthe Laws of Singapore). In addition, Sections 274 and 275 of the SFA provide the exemption \nfrom the prospectus requirement for offers to Institutional Investors (274) and Accredited \nInvestors (275). \nAccredited Investors is a collective term defined in Section 4A of the SFA as \n1.  an individual\na.  whose net personal assets exceed in value SGD2 million (or its equivalent in a \nforeign currency) or such other amount as MAS may prescribe in place of the \nfirst amount; or\n2  MAS.

The SFA defines Institutional Investors as\n \n1.  a bank that is licensed under the Banking Act (Cap.\u00a019);\n2.  a merchant bank that is approved as a financial institution under section\u00a028 of the \nMonetary Authority of Singapore Act (Cap. 186);\n3.  a finance company that is licensed under the Finance Companies Act (Cap. 108);\n4.  a company or cooperative society that is licensed under the Insurance Act \n(Cap.\u00a0142) to carry on insurance business in Singapore;\n5.  a company licensed under the Trust Companies Act 2005 (Act 11 of 2005);\n6.  the Government of Singapore;\n7.  a statutory body established under any act;\n8.  a pension fund or collective investment scheme;\n9.  the holder of a capital markets services license for\na.  dealing in securities;\nb.  fund management;\nc.  providing custodial services for securities;\nd.  real estate investment trust management;\ne.  securities financing; or\nf.  trading in futures contracts;\n10.  a person (other than an individual) who carries on the business of dealing in bonds \nwith Institutional Investors or expert investors; \n3  MAS has prescribed the following persons as Accredited Investors for the purposes of the SFA:  \n(i) the trustee of a trust of which all property and rights of any kind whatsoever held on trust for the \nbeneficiaries of the trust exceed SGD10 million in value (or its equivalent in a foreign currency); \n(ii) an entity (other than a corporation) with net assets exceeding SGD10 million in value (or its \nequivalent in a foreign currency); (iii) a partnership (other than a limited liability partnership within \nthe meaning of the Limited Liability Partnerships Act, 2005 (Act 5 of 2005) in which each partner is \nan Accredited Investor; and (iv) a corporation, the sole business of which is to hold investments and \nthe entire share capital of which is owned by one or more persons, each of whom is an Accredited \nInvestor.", "AMBIF Implementation Guidelines for Singapore 173\n11.  the trustee of such trust as MAS may prescribe, when acting in that capacity; or \n12.  such other person as MAS may prescribe.4\nThe SFA\u2019s definition of Institutional Investors corresponds most closely with the AMBIF \nscope of professional investors. The definition also applies to foreign Institutional Investors \nfulfilling one of the conditions set out above.\nInstitutional Investors based in Singapore may invest in overseas markets without limitation, \nunless these institutions\u2019 own mandates, investment guidelines, or specific prudential \nregulations prescribe particular restrictions. \n4  MAS has prescribed the following persons as Institutional Investors for the purposes of the SFA:  \n(i) a designated market-maker; (ii) a headquarters company or Finance and Treasury Centre which \ncarries on a class of business involving fund management, where such business has been approved \nas a qualifying service in relation to that headquarters company or Finance and Treasury Centre \nunder section 43E (2) (a) or 43G (2) (a) of the Income Tax Act (Cap. 134), as the case may be;  \n(iii) a person resident in Singapore who undertakes fund management activity in Singapore on \nbehalf of not more than 30 qualified investors; and (iv) a Service Company which carries on \nbusiness as an agent of a member of Lloyd\u2019s.

However, it is necessary to point \nout that laws related to bond and note issuance and settlement must be governed by the \nlaws and regulations of the place of issuance since AMBIF bonds and notes are domestic \nbonds and notes.\nIn Singapore, it is generally accepted that contracting parties can determine the jurisdiction \nof the governing law, which is not restricted to Singapore law. Also, in the case of a profile \nlisting on the SGX Wholesale Bonds market, the governing law and jurisdiction for the bond \nor note issuance is left to the parties involved. Only the listing agreement is required to be \nexecuted under Singapore law.\nLanguage of Documentation and Disclosure Items\nIt is envisaged that most of the ASEAN+3 markets participating in AMBIF will be able to \naccept the use of a common document in English; however, some markets may require \nthe submission of approval-related information in their prescribed format and in the local \nlanguage. In such cases, concessions from these regulatory authorities for a submission of \nrequired information in English, in addition to the local language and formats, may be sought. \nEnglish is one of the four official languages of Singapore, along with Chinese, Malay, \nand Tamil. All contracts, bond and note issuance documentation and disclosure items, \napplications, approvals, and correspondence with regulatory authorities and market \ninstitutions\u2014if so required\u2014must be in English.", "AMBIF Implementation Guidelines for Singapore 175\nCredit Rating\nBonds and notes issued to Institutional Investors in the Singapore domestic bond market do \nnot require a credit rating. \nAt the same time, a credit rating is one of three possible alternative criteria for eligibility to \nlist a bond or note aimed at Institutional Investors on the Wholesale Bonds market on SGX. \nMost issuers do not choose to use the credit rating criterion when considering listing on SGX.\nThe majority of bonds and notes issued in the Singapore domestic bond market, typically \ndenominated in Singapore dollars, are unrated.\nSelling and Transfer Restrictions\nSelling and transfer restrictions for bonds and notes intended for professional investors are \nwell defined in Singapore, in both regulations and listing rules for the professional Wholesale \nBonds market on SGX. \nFor ease of reference, the term \u201cInstitutional Investors\u201d is used when referring to professional \ninvestors in Singapore, since this SFA-defined investor type corresponds most closely with \nthe AMBIF Element of Scope of Investors.\nIntermediaries for trades in bonds and notes listed on the Wholesale Bonds market will \nhave to establish in their know-your-customer procedures whether or not an investor would \nqualify as an Institutional Investor.\nOn SGX, Wholesale Bonds market listings offer no access to retail investors. Listing rules \ninclude the adherence of all issuers and underwriters to these restrictions. In addition, SGX \nparticipant institutions must confirm that they will observe all applicable rules and regulations.\nAs a matter of market practice, documentation for bonds and notes aimed at Institutional \nInvestors would typically carry references to the applicable sections of the SFA and SGX \nListing Rules and other relevant regulations. While no specific wording is prescribed in the \nlaw or rules, the market tends to follow a standard format for professional bond issuance \ndocumentation.\nNote Issuance Programs\nAMBIF promotes the use of note issuance programs, such as the medium-term note (MTN) \nformat, because they not only give funding flexibility to issuers but also represent the most \ncommon format of bond and note issuance in the international bond market. This means \nthat potential issuers, as well as investors and intermediaries, are likely to be familiar with \nnote issuance programs and related practices. Hence, this would make AMBIF comparable \nto the relevant practices in the international bond market. At the same time, it is expected \nthat potential issuers may benefit from reusing or adopting existing documentation or \ninformation on disclosure items.\nNote issuance programs are well established and widely accepted in the Singapore market. \nThe legal basis for the use of note issuance programs can be found in Section 240A of the \nSFA, which provides for a debenture issuance program.", "176 Appendix 8\nBond Trustee\nThe appointment of a bond trustee for professional bonds and notes issuances is optional, \nbut the majority of bonds and notes listed for profiling on the SGX Wholesale Bonds market \nfeatures a bond trustee. This is driven by market practice and conventions with regard to \ntargeted Institutional Investors who are subject to prudential regulations, such as insurance \ncompanies and mutual and pension funds.\nTrustees for bonds and notes may be trustee companies as well as financial institutions.", "AMBIF Bond and Note Issuance \nProcess in Singapore\nOverview of Regulatory Processes \nMinimal regulatory processes are required for bond and note issuance to Institutional \nInvestors in the Singapore market. There are no specific distinctions by corporate issuer type, \nas shown in Table A8.2.\nIn order to make the issuance processes by issuer type more comparable across ASEAN+3 \nmarkets, Table A8.2 features common issuer type distinctions that are evident in regional \nmarkets.

To be recognized \nas a domestic bond or note, an AMBIF bond or note needs to be settled at the designated \ncentral securities depository (CSD). Hence, domestic settlement needs to be a key feature of \nan AMBIF bond or note.\nIn Thailand\nWhile there is no regulatory requirement that bonds and notes traded over-the-counter \n(OTC) need to be settled at the Thai Securities Depository (TSD), most debt securities, in \nparticular those aimed at international professional investors, are settled by TSD. Bonds and \nnotes traded on the Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET) are required to be settled by TSD. \nPrivate placement issuances may be settled at an appointed custodian bank acting as \ndepository. However, these bonds and notes are not considered eligible for the purposes of \nAMBIF.\n1  ASEAN+3 refers to the 10 members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) plus \nthe People\u2019s Republic of China, Japan, and the Republic of Korea.", "184 Appendix 9\nTable A9.1: AMBIF Elements and Equivalent Features in Thailand\nAMBIF Elements Description Equivalent in Thailand \nDomestic Settlement Bonds and notes are settled at a national CSD in  Thai Securities Depository (TSD)\nASEAN+3 markets\nHarmonized Documents  A common approach is of submitting  Minimum requirements specified in SEC Act \nfor Submission (Single  information as input for regulatory process(es)  (Sections 69 and 70);\nSubmission Form) where approval or consent is required.

Hence, the Single Submission Form (SSF) that can be \napplied to all of the relevant regulatory processes for bond and note issuance across markets \nwas proposed. The information contained in the SSF can be submitted to all relevant regulatory \nauthorities and market institutions for relevant approvals or consent, or used in the context of \nthe submission (e.g., as a checklist) in anticipation of an AMBIF bond or note issuance.\nIn Thailand\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission, Thailand (SEC) will recognize the SSF format \nas long as the requirements of Thai regulations continue to be observed.

A registration or listing authority function to facilitate continuous disclosure is \nrequired. This can ensure the quality of disclosure and help create a well-organized market \nfor AMBIF issuances with transparency and a quality of information that would differentiate \nAMBIF issuances from ordinary private placements for which information is often neither \navailable nor guaranteed. Owing to this important feature, an AMBIF secondary market is \nexpected to emerge as the number of issuances increases. \nA profile listing is a listing without trading on an exchange. The objective of the listing is to \nmake bonds and notes visible and more information available to investors via a recognized \nlisting place, particularly those investors with more restrictive mandates, such as mutual and \npension funds. A profile listing at a designated listing place can ensure the flow of continuous \ndisclosure information and possibly even reference pricing in some markets.\nIn Thailand\nIn the Thai market, registration is defined as the process of providing bond or note \ninformation to the Thai Bond Market Association (ThaiBMA) by issuers or their agents, \nwhich is a condition set by the SEC for the offering of bonds and notes in the primary market, \nas well as reporting trade data by OTC counterparties in the secondary market. All bond \ndealers and traders in Thailand are required to be members of ThaiBMA.\nAll debt securities issued and offered for sale in Thailand,2 regardless of issuer domicile \nor currency, have to be registered with ThaiBMA.3 In addition, Thai law mandates that \nThaiBMA members capture their OTC bond transactions within 15 minutes of deal closure. \nThaiBMA calculates and publishes reference prices on the basis of trade prices submitted, \nand collects material disclosure information. ThaiBMA also provides significant transaction, \nvolume, and general statistics on the bond market to interested parties.\nThe registration with ThaiBMA fulfills the intention of the Registration or Profile Listing \nfeature under AMBIF. However, professional bonds and notes in Thailand are typically traded \nin the OTC market. In any case, the supervision and enforcement of continuous disclosure \nobligations by the issuers of bonds and notes in Thailand remains with the SEC. \nCurrency\nAMBIF\nIn the context of AMBIF, the denomination of an issue is generally expected to be in the \ndomestic currency of each ASEAN+3 market. But this does not exclude the possibility of \nissuing in other currencies if market practice regularly supports these other currencies and \nthe relevant domestic currency or cash clearing capabilities exist. At this stage, US dollars, \n2  This includes all debt securities issued and offered for sale in Thailand with the exception of Limited \nNumber Private Placements (fewer than 10 investors) and short-term notes.\n3  In contrast, bonds and notes issued in Thailand but offered for sale outside Thailand need not be \nregistered with ThaiBMA.", "186 Appendix 9\nJapanese yen, and offshore Chinese renminbi are the currencies other than domestic \ncurrencies in which bonds and notes tend to be issued in ASEAN+3 markets. \nIn Thailand\nDebt securities in Thailand are predominantly issued in Thai baht, but can also be issued in \na foreign currency if the issuer and investors so agree; this requires the approval of the Bank \nof Thailand (BOT). In the case of a foreign issuer issuing THB-denominated bonds or notes, \nthe approval of the Public Debt Management Office (PDMO) is required as well. In the past \nfew years, only a few USD-denominated bonds and notes have been issued in Thailand. \nThe issuance of bonds denominated in offshore Chinese renminbi was first observed in \nJune\u00a02015.\nScope of Issuers\nAMBIF\nAs AMBIF is aimed at supporting the development of domestic bond markets in the region \nand promoting the intraregional recycling of funds, an issuer needs to be a resident of an \nASEAN+3 market.\nIn Thailand\nIn addition to Thai residents, nonresident legal entities may issue THB-denominated bonds \nand notes under the Baht Bond concept, as well as bonds and notes denominated in a \nforeign currency.  \nNonresident issuers are defined in the SEC Act (in the description of foreign issuers) as \u201ca \nunit or organization of foreign government, international organization and juristic person \nunder the law of a foreign jurisdiction.\u201d More specifically, nonresident issuers are defined \nunder a Ministry of Finance Notification for PDMO as\n1.  international financial institutions (e.g., Asian Development Bank, International \nFinance Corporation, and International Monetary Fund),\n2.  foreign governments,\n3.  financial institutions of foreign governments,\n4.  juridical entities that have been established under foreign laws, and\n5.  special purpose vehicles.4  \nA bond or note issued by a special purpose vehicle may not be regarded as an AMBIF bond \nor note at this point.\nScope of Investors\nAMBIF\nProfessional investors are defined in accordance with regulations and/or market practice in \neach market in ASEAN+3.

However, it is necessary to point \nout that laws related to bond and note issuance and settlement must be governed by the \nlaws and regulations of the place of issuance since AMBIF bonds and notes are domestic \nbonds and notes.\nThai law accepts the contracting parties\u2019 right to agree on the governing law or jurisdiction for \ncontractual arrangements. The legal basis is contained in the Conflict of Laws Act B.E. 2481, \n1938. \nIn 2006, the Ministry of Finance (MOF) issued the Notification: Permission to Issue Baht-\ndenominated Bonds or Debentures by Foreign Entities in Thailand, which stipulates rules for \nforeign entities to issue THB-denominated bonds or debentures. Clause 8 of the notification \n(Applicable Laws and Applicable Jurisdiction) states that \u201c[the] Grantee shall include in \nthe terms and conditions of the bond or debenture approved pursuant to this Notification \na stipulation that such terms and conditions are subject to the laws of the Kingdom of \nThailand, and that any legal proceedings related to such bond or debenture be subject to \nThai court unless the Minister has approved otherwise.\u201d5\nThere is no specific requirement of the description of an event of default, which will depend \non the terms and conditions defined for the bond or note offering. \nShould the parties involved in a bond or note issuance choose to use Thai law, the \njurisdiction of the issuance would fall to Thai courts by default. If, in contrast, issuance \nparties agree on another governing law, the parties would also have to specifically determine \nthe jurisdiction of a court in which provisions of the bond or note issuance (e.g., settlement \nagency) could be enforced and any disputes would be heard and decided.\n5  Ministry of Finance of Thailand. http://www2.mof.go.th/webmanage/ps_releases/3/42-2006.pdf", "190 Appendix 9\nIn the case of issuance of THB-denominated bonds and notes in Thailand, including when \ncontracting parties choose a governing law other than Thai law for the contract, it would still \nbe natural to elect Thai law as the law specific to issuance- and settlement-related matters.\nIn any case, the actual use of governing laws or jurisdictions other than those of Thailand \nmay be subject to clarification or legal advice from a qualified law firm, as may be necessary.\nLanguage of Documentation and Disclosure Items\nIt is envisaged that most of the ASEAN+3 markets participating in AMBIF will be able to \naccept the use of a common document in English; however, some markets may require \nthe submission of approval-related information in their prescribed format and in the local \nlanguage. In such cases, concessions from these regulatory authorities for a submission of \nrequired information in English, in addition to the local language and formats, may be sought. \nUnder Thai law, it is expected that a language other than Thai would be accepted for the \npurpose of contractual documents and official submissions. At this stage, foreign issuers are \nallowed to use official submissions or the filing of applications and disclosure items in English. \nTo offer this feature (English version) to Thai issuers offering bonds and notes to PP-AI in \nmultiple jurisdictions, the SEC is aiming to revise related regulations in 2015.\nCredit Rating\nUnder SEC regulations, a credit rating for PP-AI issuances is not mandatory. However, in \ncases of a foreign issuer offering THB-denominated debt securities under the Baht Bond \nconcept to Accredited Investors, PDMO requires a credit rating in every case, except when \nthe bonds or notes are issued by a government or with a government guarantee.\nHowever, market participants may still prefer to have a credit rating in place since many \nmarket participants designated as professional investors may not be able to replicate in-\nhouse the credit assessment process undertaken by the credit rating agencies.\nIf a rating for an issuer and/or a PP-AI issuance is required between the parties involved, \nonly the rating of a credit rating agency approved by the SEC will be acceptable in the Thai \nmarket.\nAccording to the Notification of the Office of the Securities and Exchange Commission No. \nSorChor. 7/2555 Re: Credit Rating Agencies Approved to Issue Credit Rating for Instruments \nSubject to Rules Concerning Issuance and Offer for Sale and Investment of Funds, SEC-\napproved credit rating agencies include \n1.  those established under Thai law with approval from the SEC; and\n2.  the following credit rating agencies established under foreign law: \na.

Rating and Investment Information, Inc. is not accepted by PDMO.", "AMBIF Implementation Guidelines forThailand 191\nSelling and Transfer Restrictions\nSelling and transfer restrictions for the issuance of bonds and notes to professional investors \nare well defined for PP-AI issuance in the Thai market.\nPursuant to the 2012 Notification of the Securities and Exchange Commission No. KorChor. \n9/2555 Re: Determination of Definitions of Institutional Investors and High Net Worth \nInvestors, any issuance to professional investors using the concessions for PP-AI issuance \non disclosure and regulatory processes must indicate that a bond or note issuance is a PP-AI \nissuance (including foreign institutional investors) in all offer documents, including the term \nsheet of a proposed bond or note issue, and related correspondence. \nNote Issuance Programs\nAMBIF promotes the use of note issuance programs, such as the medium-term note (MTN) \nformat, because they not only give funding flexibility to issuers but also represent the most \ncommon format of bond and note issuance in the international bond market. This means \nthat potential issuers, as well as investors and intermediaries, are likely to be familiar with \nnote issuance programs and related practices. Hence, this would make AMBIF comparable \nto the relevant practices in the international bond market. At the same time, it is expected \nthat potential issuers may benefit from reusing or adopting existing documentation or \ninformation on disclosure items.\nAt this stage, the issuance of domestic bonds and notes to professional investors via an MTN \nprogram is not evident in the Thai market. However, Thailand has an MTN-like program in \nwhich the issuer who has updated publicly available information (e.g., a Thai listed company \nor a foreign company that has submitted updated information to the SEC) can refer to such \ninformation in the offering circular, instead of submitting the whole document. In addition, \nthe cooling-off period for the issuance under PP-AI is only 1 business day. \nHowever, PDMO cannot grant a blanket approval to a foreign issuer for the maximum \nissuance amount in any given period under this MTN-like note issuance program, due to the \nlimited quota available. Therefore, approval will be given on an issuance-by-issuance basis.\nThe SEC is in the process of evaluating the benefits of bond and note issuance via an MTN-\nlike program similar to international markets. \nBondholder Representative\nSEC regulations require the appointment of a bondholder representative only if a bond or \nnote is offered through a public offer. This is not mandatory for PP-AI issuances. However, \nPDMO requires the appointment of a bondholder representative for bonds and notes issued \nby a foreign issuer under the Baht Bond program in every case.\nThe SEC does not require the issuer to appoint a bondholder representative when a bond or \nnote issued in another jurisdiction is offered for sale in the PP-AI market.\nAccording to the SEC Act, the issuer shall appoint the bond or debenture holder \nrepresentative in Thailand during the tenure of the bond for the benefits to the holders. The ", "192 Appendix 9\nbondholder representative calls for bondholder meetings or undertakes all such activities as \nmay be required on behalf of the bondholders, including in the case of a default.\nBondholder representatives typically are banks or financial institutions, and have specific \nfiduciary and fiscal responsibilities under Thai law.", "AMBIF Bond and Note Issuance \nProcess in Thailand\nThis chapter describes the regulatory processes and necessary steps for the issuance of \nbonds and notes to Accredited Investors in the Thai market. \nOverview of Regulatory Processes \nRegulatory Processes by Corporate Issuer Type\nThai regulations distinguish between domestic and foreign issuers, but there is generally no \ndistinction between general corporate issuers and financial institutions, unless a financial \ninstitution intends to issue a bond or note to satisfy capital requirements. Additional \napprovals are needed for issuers planning to issue bonds or notes in a foreign currency.\nIn order to make the issuance processes by issuer type more comparable across ASEAN+3 \nmarkets, Table A9.2 features common issuer type distinctions that are evident in regional \nmarkets. Not all markets will distinguish all such issuer types. Sovereign issuers may be \nsubject to different regulatory processes.\nRegulatory Process Map: Overview\nThe regulatory process map shown in Figure A9.1 may help with the navigation of the \napplicable regulatory processes in Thailand for proposed bond or note issuance. Individual \nprocesses are explained in detail below.\nThere is no requirement for the use of an underwriter for a bond or note offering under  \nPP-AI. However, in cases when an issuer wants to appoint an underwriter, such an \nunderwriter must be licensed by the SEC. \nIn addition to appointing an underwriter, an issuer may appoint another person to help in \npreparing and submitting the offering circular to the SEC; this party is called a Financial \nAdviser.6 However, in practice, most underwriters also hold a Financial Adviser license; in \nsuch cases, the underwriter and the Financial Adviser will be the same party.\nAt the same time, even if an issuer of bonds or notes appoints an underwriter, or a Financial \nAdviser, the issuer may file the necessary documents directly with the SEC.\n6  The Financial Adviser is a legal entity licensed by the SEC; the Financial Adviser license is different \nfrom that of an underwriter.

Sections 69 and 70 stipulate the minimum \ndisclosure requirements for issuers, without prescribing a particular format for submission. \nThis allows issuers or their agents to utilize typical documentation for issuance of bonds \nand notes to professional investors, such as an information memorandum or an offering \ncircular, as long as all required information is contained therein. In the Thai market, a short \nprospectus refers to typical documentation in order to distinguish documentation specific \nto PP-AI issuances from public offers. A short prospectus is equivalent to an information \nmemorandum or an offering circular in style and content.\nThe offering circular itself, known as Form 69-DEBT-II&HNW, was introduced in the \nNotification of the Capital Market Supervisory Board No. TorChor. 10/2556 Re: Submission \nof an Offering Circular for Offer for Sale of Debt Securities dated 11 March 2013, and \nreplaces the previous format known as Form 69-S.\nAccording to Section 69 of the SEC Act, an offering circular (for PP-AI) must contain the \nfollowing details:\n1.  objective of the offer for sale of the securities to the public or any person;\n2.  name of the issuing company that issues securities;\n3.  capital of the company;\n4.  amount and type of the securities offered for sale;\n5.  expected selling price per unit of securities;\n6.  nature of the business;\n7.  financial condition, business operations, and material information of the business;\n8.  management and major shareholders of the issuing company;\n9.  auditor regularly contacted financial institutions, and legal advisor of the issuing \ncompany;\n10.  procedures for the subscription, underwriting, and allocation of securities; and\n11.  other information as specified in the notification of the Capital Market Supervisory \nBoard.\nIn addition, Section 70 of the SEC Act prescribes that the offering circular for the sale of \nbonds and notes under PP-AI shall also contain the following information:\n1.  rights and restrictions related to the transfer of bills or debentures;\n2.  return on debentures and bills;\n3.  property or other collateral used as security of repayment, if any;\n4.  debenture holder representative, if any;\n5.  encumbrances on property of the company that issues securities in the case of \nunsecured securities;\n6.  outstanding debt from previous issues of bills or debentures;\n7.  procedure, time, and place of repayment;\n8.  procedures for conversion of rights, if any; and\n9.  other information as specified in the notification of Capital Market Supervisory Board.\nTo avoid the resale of PP-AI debt securities to other types of investors, the SEC requires the \nissuer to register the transfer restrictions to ensure that the sale and resale of these debt \nsecurities will only occur among Accredited Investors.\nFrom 1 July 2015, the filing of an offering circular with the SEC should be done online through \nthe Initial Product Offering System (IPOS), which will initially be available only in Thai, with \nan English version available at a later stage.", "AMBIF Implementation Guidelines forThailand 197\nAt present, the SEC does not approve note issuance through an MTN program. As \nmentioned earlier, Thailand has an MTN-like program for THB-denominated bond and \nnote\u00a0issuance.\nThe SEC charges a fee, which is payable on the submission date, for the filing of an offering \ncircular. \nThe SEC has confirmed that the SSF may be used for this filing since the SSF was reviewed \nby the SEC and contains all relevant information required of an offering circular and the \nprovisions of Sections 69 and 70 of the SEC Act, as detailed above.\nStep 2: Approval of Offering Circular by the SEC\nThe SEC reviews the (draft) offering circular, and may provide feedback as necessary. \nThe SEC may instruct the promoters of a public limited company, a company, or owner of \nsecurities to attach any documents other than those specified in the offering circular. \nThe issuer or underwriter may revise or, possibly, resubmit the offering circular, as may be \nnecessary. When this is the case, a cooling-off period of 1 day will have to be observed.\nThe offering circular becomes effective upon expiry of the cooling-off period after \nsubmission of completed documents and if no further amendments to the offering circular \nare submitted. The SEC will issue a formal letter to inform the issuer that the offering circular \nbecomes effective. After the effective date, the issuer may proceed with offers of sale to \ninvestors.\nThe issuance approval by the SEC does not carry an expiry date. However, if an issuer has \nnot issued bonds and notes under an approval within a certain period of time (e.g., 6\u00a0months \nfrom approval date) the issuer is required to update information in the offering circular with \nthe SEC.\nOnce the SEC approves the offering circular, the bond and note information required for the \nregistration with ThaiBMA will be transmitted automatically from IPOS to ThaiBMA\u2019s Bond \nRegistration Information System. The issuer or its agent may also print this information from \nIPOS for use in the formal registration (Step 3).\nStep 3: Registration with ThaiBMA\nThe registration of a bond or note issue with ThaiBMA is required by SEC regulations as a \ncondition for the offering of bonds and notes in the primary market in Thailand.\nStarting from 1 July 2015, however, the ThaiBMA registration process has been integrated \nwith the SEC approval process. When bond and note issuers submit their filing to the SEC \nthrough IPOS (Step 1) and the issuance is subsequently approved by the SEC (Step 2), the \nbond and note information will be electronically submitted to the ThaiBMA registration \ndatabase. The issuer can then print the official registration form already containing all \nrequired information from IPOS and submit it to ThaiBMA as the formal registration request. \nThe registration process is normally completed within 24 hours. It includes a one-time \nregistration fee and an annual fee for the first 6 years of the tenure of the bond or note, which \nare charged by ThaiBMA to the issuer.

The post-issuance reporting is expected \nto be submitted to the SEC within 15 days after the end of the month in which the sales were \nmade (e.g., an issuance or sale in February would require reporting by 15 March).\nIssuance Process for Resident Nonfinancial Institution Issuer \nIn Thailand, the issuance process for resident issuers that are nonfinancial institutions is the \nsame as described above.\nIssuance Process for Resident Financial Institution Issuer\nIn Thailand, the issuance process for resident financial institutions is the same as described \nabove. The regulatory process map shown in Figure A9.3 may help with the navigation of \nthe applicable regulatory processes in Thailand for issuance of PP-AI by a resident financial \ninstitution.\nHowever, in such cases where a bond or note issuance by a resident financial institution \nis intended to support capital requirements, a resident financial institution might file an \napplication for issuance approval from the BOT in parallel with an application for issuance \napproval from the SEC. The additional process is described in this section.\nThe following steps need to be observed when a resident financial institution wants to issue \nunder PP-AI in Thailand and use the proceeds to support capital requirements.   \nStep 1a: Filing of (Draft) Offering Circular with the SEC\nPlease refer to Issuance Process for Resident Issuer, Step 1.\nStep 1b: Request for Approval from the BOT\nThe issuer will need to file a request for approval with the BOT\u2019s Financial Institution \nApplications Department.

The regulatory \nprocess map shown in Figure A9.4 may help with the navigation of the applicable regulatory \nprocesses in Thailand for issuance under PP-AI by a nonresident (foreign) entity.\nNonresident issuers are defined in the SEC Act (in the description of foreign issuers) as \u201ca \nunit or organization of foreign government, international organization and juristic person \nunder the law of a foreign jurisdiction.\u201d More specifically, nonresident issuers are defined \nunder a Ministry of Finance Notification for PDMO as", "200 Appendix 9\n1.  international financial institutions (e.g., Asian Development Bank, International \nFinance Corporation, and International Monetary Fund),\n2.  foreign governments,\n3.  financial institutions of foreign governments,\n4.  juridical entities that have been established under foreign laws, and\n5.  special purpose vehicles.  \nThe objective of the Baht Bond process is to control the maximum amount of THB-\ndenominated bond or note issuances by nonresidents, who often swap the proceeds into a \nforeign currency. In line with this objective, the SSF (IV: Information on the Notes, 2. Other \nInformation of the Notes, item 16) requires describing the name of the cross-currency \nswap intermediaries in the case of THB-denominated bonds and notes issued by non-\nThai\u00a0residents.\nPDMO presently invites issuers to submit an application during three periods in a calendar \nyear. Currently, submission dates can be any working day in March, July, and November. An \napproval is preceded by consultations with the BOT and SEC.\nFollowing PDMO approval, the issuer may issue the authorized amount within a 9-month \ntime frame, counted from the date of submission of the Baht Bond issuance application. If a \nforeign issuer is granted an approval but does not issue any bonds or notes in the authorized \nperiod, PDMO may penalize the issuer. As such, the SSF (IV: Information on the Notes, 2. \nOther Information of the Notes, item 17) requires describing the timing of a bond issuance \nwithin the period authorized by PDMO in the case of THB-denominated bonds and notes \nissued by non-Thai residents.\nPDMO\u2019s regulatory process for Baht Bonds is described in more detail in an official \ndocument available on the website of the MOF: http://www.pdmo.go.th/upload/ebook_img/\nBaht_Denominated_Bond_%20in_Thailand_Version_2014.pdf\nSuccessful PDMO approval is followed by the regulatory process of PP-AI approval from \nthe\u00a0SEC.\nUnder current SEC regulations, a nonresident (foreign) issuer needs to appoint a contact \nperson in Thailand. The purpose of the contact person is to field questions or requests \ndirected at the issuer, and to disseminate information provided by the issuer to bondholders \nin Thailand. \nThe SEC Act states that \u201c[the issuer] shall appoint a representative in Thailand to act as a \nperson during the tenure of the bond or note in order to receive letters, orders, notices, and \ndocuments, or to contact the relevant authorities.\u201d7 Contact persons do not have fiduciary or \nfiscal responsibilities under the law.\nThe duties of a contact person have traditionally been carried out by law firms, but could also \nbe performed by other professional firms, banks, or financial institutions.\nThe following steps need to be observed by a nonresident (foreign) issuer when applying for \na THB-denominated bond issuance (PP-AI) under the Baht Bond process. \n7  Securities and Exchange Commission, Thailand. http://www.sec.or.th/EN/SECInfo/LawsRegulation/\nDocuments/actandroyal/1Securities.pdf", "AMBIF Implementation Guidelines forThailand 201\nFigure A9.4: Regulatory Process: Issuance of PP-AI by Nonresident  \n(Foreign) Issuer  \nNonresident Issuer\nUnderwriter/Financial Advisor\n7 \u2013 Approval 4 \u2013 Approval  2 \u2013 Approval\n1 \u2013 Request \n6 \u2013 Request 9 \u2013 Post- 3 \u2013 Filing of  for  Approval\nfor Use  Issuance Offering  of Baht Bond\nof Proceeds Reporting Circular Issuance\nBOT SEC PDMO\n8 \u2013 SNA 5 \u2013 Formal Information\nOpening Registration Transmission\nFinancial \nThaiBMA\nInstitution\nBOT = Bank of Thailand; PDMO = Public Debt Management Office; PP-AI = Private Placement for \nAccredited Investors; SEC = Securities and Exchange Commission, Thailand; SNA = Special Nonresident \nBaht Account; ThaiBMA = Thai Bond Market Association.\nSource: ABMF SF1.\nStep 1: Letter of Application of Baht Bond Issuance to PDMO\nThe issuer or underwriter submits an application letter, together with relevant documents, \nto the Finance Minister (to the attention of PDMO); this letter of application should contain \ninformation on the\n1.  objective of fundraising,\n2.  type of bond,\n3.  maturity,\n4.  issue size,\n5.  offering method (private placement),\n6.  timing of issuance,\n7.  use of proceeds,\n8.  cross-currency swap intermediaries, if applicable,\n9.  credit rating requirement(s), and\n10.  collateral guarantee, if applicable. \nThe applicant issuer must provide sufficient evidence to show that it has the legal capacity to \nissue securities under its governing laws.\nSince the issuer also needs to file an offering circular with the SEC, the applicable minimum \ndisclosure requirements set out in Sections 69 and 70 of the SEC Act will need to be \nobserved.", "202 Appendix 9\nStep 2: Approval from PDMO\nPDMO, in conjunction with representatives from the BOT and SEC, will review the letter of \napplication and supplementary documents.
