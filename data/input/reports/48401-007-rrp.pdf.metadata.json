Despite its strategic location \nconnecting the PRC with the rest of Central Asia, the country\u2019s 2015 per capita gross domestic \nproduct of $1,094 was the second lowest among the countries that form the Commonwealth of \nIndependent  States.  About  30.6%  of  its  population  of  6  million  people  were  living  below  the \nnational poverty line in 2014.4 The Kyrgyz Republic has limited resources with which to meet its \ngoals of sustainable growth and reducing persistent poverty. Poverty and economic disparities \ncontributed  to  popular  unrest  in the  recent  past  and  remain the  greatest  challenges  faced  the \nGovernment of the Kyrgyz Republic. \n \nRoad  transport  is  the  dominant  means  of  transport  in  the  Kyrgyz  Republic,  accounting \n4. \nfor  about  95%  of  cargo and 96%  of  passenger traffic  in 2015.5 An  efficient  transport sector  is, \ntherefore,  essential  for  the  development  of  domestic  and  international  trade  and  poverty \nreduction. The  country\u2019s  transport  network  comprises approximately  35,000 kilometers  (km)  of \nroads.  The  Ministry  of  Transport  and  Roads  (MOTR)6 is  the  lead  agency  for  transport  policy, \nregulation,  planning,  and  development.  It  manages  60  work  units  responsible  for  the \nconstruction, repair, and maintenance of 4,163 km of international roads, 5,678 km of national \nroads,  and  8,969  km  of  provincial  roads.  The  total  maintenance  budget  in  2015  was  \nSom1.8 billion. The government maintains separate road corridor management departments for \nthe  Bishkek\u2013Osh  and  Bishkek\u2013Torugart  roads  due  to  their  strategic  importance,  and  has \nprioritized the maintenance of these international roads.7 \n \n\n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  Government of the Kyrgyz Republic. 2013.

Bishkek. \n6  On  29  June  2016,  the  President of the  Kyrgyz  Republic  renamed  the  Ministry  of  Transport  and  Communications \nthe  MOTR  following  the  Parliament\u2019s  approval  with  regard  to  the  restructuring  of  the  government.  The  MOTR\u2019s \nfunctions will remain the same as before, but communications functions will now fall under the State Committee of \nInformation Technology and Communications. \n\n7  MOTR. 2016. The Road Sector Strategy 2016\u20132025. Bishkek. \n\n \n\n \n\n\fThe Kyrgyz Republic\u2019s key national and regional road network comprises (i) two north\u2013\n5. \nsouth international corridors in the west and east, and (ii) one east\u2013west international corridors \nin the north (see map). To ensure the nation\u2019s balanced development, it is urgently necessary to \naddress the following network planning issues: (i) low density of the road and transport network, \nespecially  in  the  country\u2019s  center;  and  (ii)  low  access  from  national  roads  to  local  city  centers \nand  international  highways,  especially  the  north\u2013south  international  highways  in  the  west  and \neast. These issues seriously constrain transport logistics and inclusive economic growth. \n \nCAREC  Corridor  1  connects  the  Russian  Federation  and  Europe to  PRC;  it  is the  only \n6. \nnorth\u2013south  trunk  road  providing  access  of  central  Kyrgyz  Republic  to  the  rest  of  the  country \nand beyond. Similarly, CAREC Corridor 3 connects  the Russian Federation and Europe to the \nMiddle East and South Asia; it is the only direct link between the southern and northern parts of \nthe country, linking two major economic and agricultural hubs, the capital city of Bishkek and the \nsecond largest city of the country, Osh. Joining these two CAREC corridors will link the southern \nregions  (Batken,  Jalal-Abad,  and  Osh)  with  the  northern  regions  (Chui,  Issyk-Kul,  Naryn,  and \nTalas) through a faster and safer alternative route, and facilitate further access to international \nmarkets.8 \n \n7. \nThe  Kyrgyz  Republic\u2019s  road  network  is  one  of  its  most  valuable  public  assets.  \nTo  maintain  this  network  systematically,  efficiently,  and  effectively,  it  is  necessary  to  \n(i)  strengthen  maintenance  financing,  (ii)  improve  road  data  collection  and  management,  and  \n(iii)  optimize  road  maintenance  works.  To  this  end,  the  project  will  introduce  an  appropriate \nRAMS to optimize the allocation of resources for the management, operation, preservation, and \nenhancement of road infrastructure. The RAMS will initially only cover part of the road network \nto allow the MOTR to gain experience. The system will integrate related pavement management \nsystem  work  initiated  by  the  World  Bank, 9  and  a  bridge  and  tunnel  management  system \nintroduced by the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA).10 \n  \nThe  rehabilitation  of  this  connector  road  is  consistent  with  the  government\u2019s  priority  of \n8. \nproviding  an  alternate  means  of  accessing  national  and  regional  connectivity,  as  stated  in  the \nNational  Strategy  of  Sustainable  Development,  2013\u20132017  (footnote  2).  It  is  also  aligned  with \nthe  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  country  partnership  strategy,  2013\u20132017  for  the  Kyrgyz \nRepublic, and11 Midterm Review of Strategy 2020;12 and is included in ADB\u2019s country operations \nbusiness plan, 2016\u20132018 for the Kyrgyz Republic.13 ADB provided the project design advance \n(PDA)  of  up  to  $3  million  in  2015  for  preparing  detailed  engineering  designs.14 The  related \nworks  contracts  will  start  tendering  in  October  2016,  and  will  be  awarded  when  the  proposed \nloan and grant are declared effective. \n \n \n\n                                                \n8  Sector Assessment (Summary): Transport (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n9  World  Bank.  2014.

The outcome will be \nimproved efficiency and safer movement of goods and people. \n \nC. \n\nOutputs \n\nThe outputs to be financed by ADB and the government are as follows: \n\n10. \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nrehabilitated  road  from  Epkin  village  to  Bashkugandy  village  70  km  long  \n(distance  marker  [Km]  89\u2013Km  159)  that  incorporates  specific  features  for  road \nsafety and climate change adaptation; and \nstrengthened  institutional  capacity,  including  consulting  services  for  detailed \ndesign, 15  construction  supervision,  project  management,  project  auditing, \nsafeguards  support,  the  preparation  and  implementation  of  the  RAMS,16 and  a \nreview of pilot performance-based maintenance contracting. \n\n \n11. \nIn  addition,  (i)  91  km  of  road from  Aral  village  to  CAREC  Corridor  3  via  the  Suusamyr \nvalley  (Km  195\u2013Km  286)  will  be  rehabilitated  and  cofinanced  by  the  Eurasian  Development \nBank  (EDB)  and  the  government;  and  (ii)  24  km  of  road  from  Bashkugandy  village  to  Jyldyz \nvillage (Km 159\u2013Km 183) will be rehabilitated and cofinanced by the Islamic Development Bank \n(IDB), the Saudi Fund for Development (SFD), and the government. ADB will not administer any \nof  the  cofinancing  funds.  The  financing  partners  will  implement  and  administer  their  assigned \ncomponents  parallel  to  the  ADB-financed  project  using  their  own  policies,  procedures,  and \nguidelines.

International  standards  were  applied  to  compensate  for  any  shortcomings  in  national \nstandards.  The  ADB-financed  road  section  (Epkin\u2013Bashkugandy)  is  a  two-lane  road  with  a \npavement  width  of  6\u20138  meters  (m),  and  a  mainly  asphalt  concrete  surface  in  poor  condition. \nAbout 70% of the paved areas are in an unsatisfactory condition with corrugations, cracks, and \nedge  breaks,  and  some  sections  have  already  deteriorated  to  gravel.  The  average  roughness \nindex is 8.33 m/km. \n \n20. \nThe  project  road  will  be  upgraded  to  a  category  II  standard,  with  two  paved  asphalt \ntravel lanes 3.75 m wide, paved shoulders 0.75 m wide, and unpaved shoulders 3.00 m wide. \nThe  town  passages  in  the  Epkin\u2013Bashkugandy  road,  which  are  5.3  km  long,  will  meet  the \nKyrgyz Republic\u2019s design standard for settlement roads. In addition, six bridges will be replaced \nand two bridges repaired and widened,  with a total  bridge length  of  123.8 m  between  the  two \nvillages.  Road  safety  enhancements,  such  as  guardrails,  road  signs,  sidewalks,  pedestrian \ncrossings,  pavement  markings,  and  other  safety  devices,  will  be  provided.  The  project  design \nincorporates feasible climate change adaptation and disaster risks measures. \n \n\n6 \n\n \n\n\f7 \n\nRAMS activities recently conducted in the country were assessed. The proposed RAMS \n21. \nwill  build  upon  a  bridge  and  tunnel  system  developed  with  the  support  of  JICA,  and  a  basic \npavement management system developed by the World Bank. The RAMS will be designed and \nimplemented  component-by-component,  with  the  support  of  strong  institutional  development, \ntraining,  and  data  collection.  The  first  road  network  covered  by  the  RAMS  will  include  the \nCAREC  road  network  in  the  Kyrgyz  Republic.  The  aim  of  this  approach  is  to  demonstrate  the \nsystem\u2019s benefits with a small-scale pilot, and then expand it further once the system is set up. \n \nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n22. \nEconomic  assessment. The project will lower transport costs,  increase travel speeds, \nand improve road safety outcomes for international and national traffic on the CAREC Transport \nCorridors  1  and  3  Connector  Road.  The  project\u2019s  economic  evaluation  was  undertaken  using \nthe  highway  development  and  management  model21 and  following  ADB's  Guidelines  for  the \nEconomic Analysis of Projects. 22 The road sections to be financed by ADB, the EDB, and the \nIDB  and  SFD  were  all  found  to  be  economically  viable,  having  a  combined  economic  internal \nrate of return (EIRR) of 24.9%. The estimated EIRR for the ADB-financed Epkin\u2013Bashkugandy \nroad  section  is  28.5%.  The  high  EIRR  reflects  high  traffic  volumes  and  the  poor  state  of  the \nroads without the project. Sensitivity tests confirmed that the project would remain viable even if \nthe envisaged project costs increase or benefits decrease. \n \n23. \nFinancial  sustainability.  The  road  maintenance  budget  allocation  in  2016  was \nassessed as sufficient to meet the maintenance needs of the international roads maintained by \nthe MOTR; the government is committed to maintaining a road maintenance budget at a similar \nlevel.  It  is  thus  reasonable  to  expect  that  funds  will  be  available  to  meet  the  project  road\u2019s \nmaintenance  costs.  Once  the  project  road  is  completed,  the  MOTR  will  classify  it  as  an \ninternational  corridor  subject  to  priority  operation  and  maintenance,  and  provide  necessary \nfunding from the second year of the  road\u2019s operation. In addition, when the RAMS is  in place,  \nit  will  help  the  government  utilize  its  maintenance  budget  better  by  prioritizing  critical  road \nsections.23 \n \nC. \n\nGovernance \n\n24. \nInstitutional  capacity.  ADB  has  helped  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  rehabilitate  CAREC \nCorridors 1 and 3, two regional corridors important for domestic and international travel, which \nconnect  economic  and population centers  in the north and  south  of the  country  via its  capital, \nBishkek.  The  Investment  Projects  Implementation  Group  has  been  implementing  ADB-funded \nprojects  since  1996,  and  has  delivered  more  than  13  ADB  road  projects,  with  a  total  cost  of \nmore  than  $468  million.  The  group\u2019s  staff  has  adequate  knowledge,  understanding,  and \nexperience with ADB procedures to manage the project. \n \n25. \nFinancial  management.  The  implementation  group\u2019s  capacity  for  project  financial \naccounting is satisfactory, and it has a proven track record in ADB\u2019s disbursement procedures. \nSeparate  project  records  and  accounts  will  be  maintained.  The  project  accounts  and  related \nfinancial  statements  will  be  audited  annually  in  accordance  with  national  and  international \nauditing  standards.  The  pre-mitigation  risk  rating  assigned  to  the  project  is  moderate.  Project \n\n                                                \n21 World Road Association. 2002. HDM-4 Version 2.

Master  bid  documents  were  prepared  during  the  project  preparatory \ntechnical assistance stage. The recruitment of construction supervision consultants and RAMS \nconsultants commenced in August 2016. Tendering for the civil works contracts is expected to \ncommence in October 2016. The procurement risk assessment has been carried out. ADB will \ncontinue to train and support the MOTR procurement team and tender committee. ADB and the \nMOTR  will  conduct  capacity  strengthening  activities  with  a  focus  on  identifying  conflict  of \ninterest situations and detecting collusion and other fraudulent and corrupt behaviors. \n \n27. \nAnticorruption. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained \nto  and  discussed  with  the  government  and  the  MOTR.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and \nsupplementary measures are described in the PAM (footnote 20). \n \nD. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n28. \nThe project is expected to help reduce poverty by improving the transport of goods and \npeople  as  well  as  access  to  services,  thereby  stimulating  economic  activities.  The  project  will \nalso  benefit  local  residents  and  enterprises  by  creating  jobs  during  construction  and  reducing \ntransport costs and travel times. Social and poverty assessments are in the  Summary Poverty \nReduction  and  Social  Strategy.24 The  project  is  classified  as  a  general  intervention,  with  no \ndirect poverty reduction component. It will benefit poor people in the  project area by improving \ntransport conditions and enabling better access to social services. The project design includes a \nmatrix  summarizing  actions  related  to  this  objective.  The  civil  works  contract  will  require \ncontractors  to  (i)  comply  with  the  Kyrgyz  Republic\u2019s  applicable  labor  laws  and  related \ninternational treaty obligations, and not use child labor; (ii) provide safe working conditions and \nseparate sanitation facilities for male and female workers; (iii) provide equal wages to male and \nfemale  workers  for  work  of  equal  value;  (iv)  provide  employment  opportunities  for  women;  \n(v) carry out HIV/AIDS, illicit drugs, and human trafficking prevention and awareness programs \nin workers\u2019 campsites; and (vi) construct toilets along the project road. \n \nE. \n\nSafeguards25 \n\ninitial  environmental  examination  (IEE)  reports, \n\nEnvironment.  The  project  is  classified  as  category  B  under  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy \n29. \nStatement  (2009).  Three \nincluding  an \nenvironmental  management  plan,  have  been  prepared  for  each  project  section  financed  by  \n(i)  ADB,  (ii)  the  EDB,  and  (iii)  the  IDB  and  SFD.26 Impacts,  which  will  be  mostly  related  to \nconstruction  work,  are  expected  to  be  limited  in  magnitude,  short-term  in  nature,  and \nmitigatable. They include (i) noise, dust, vehicle emissions, and vibration (these are especially \nsignificant  for  settlements  along  the  road  and  sensitive  receptors  such  as  schools,  hospitals, \nmosques,  cemeteries,  and  other  culturally  historic  objects);  (ii)  impacts  on  water  courses  and \nrivers due to bridge rehabilitation and construction works along the rivers; (iii) impacts from the \n\n                                                \n24 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n25 For the EDB- and IDB- and SFD-financed road sections, the social and environmental assessment and planning, \nsafeguard documentation,  consultation,  and  disclosure requirements  were  conducted  to satisfy  ADB's  Safeguard \nPolicy  Statement.  An  IEE  report  and  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  plan  for  the  EDB-  and  IDB-  and  SFD-\nfinanced road sections were prepared and disclosed on 22 July 2016. During implementation, the EDB, IDB, and \nSFD shall be responsible for (i) ensuring that activities carried out in connection with their financed sections comply \nwith their safeguard requirements, and (ii) resolving any complaints relating to these sections. \n26 Initial Environmental Examination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n\f9 \n\ntransportation  of  material  from  borrow  sites;  (iv)  impacts  of  tree-cutting  along  the  road  due  to \nsite-clearance  activities;  (v)  impacts  from  asphalt  plants  and  aggregate  crushers;  and  \n(vi)  impacts  from  contractors'  work  camps.  The  impacts  have  been  divided  into  design, \nconstruction, and operation phase impacts. The project will finance the cost of implementing the \nenvironmental management plan\u2014the construction contracts will include the costs of mitigation \nmeasures, and the consulting service of the construction supervision consultants will include the \ncost of environmental monitoring.  \n \n \nResettlement. Civil works associated with road construction and rehabilitation will entail \n30. \nsome  involuntary  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  impacts,  as  well  as  some  effects  on \nlivelihoods. Based on the three draft land acquisition and resettlement plans (LARPs) prepared \nseparately  for  each  project  section,  the  project  is  categorized  as  category  B  for  involuntary \nresettlement  safeguards.27 Approximately  251  affected  households,  comprising  940  displaced \npersons, will experience permanent or temporary land acquisition. Six affected households will \nbe  physically  displaced,  12  affected  households will  be  significantly  impacted,  and  57  affected \nhouseholds  are  deemed  vulnerable.  The  ADB-financed  section  will  affect  only  48  households, \ncomprising  180  displaced  persons;  no  affected  household  will  be  physically  displaced,  \none  affected  household  will  be  significantly  impacted,  and  22  households  will  be  vulnerable.  \nThe  vast  majority  of  affected  households  will  experience  minor  impacts,  such  as  the  loss  of \ntrees, fences, walls, and minor structures in sections that encroach upon the road right-of-way. \nThe LARPs prepared for each section comply with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement, and the \nMOTR  will  be  responsible  for  meeting  ADB\u2019s  safeguard  requirements  in  the  ADB-financed \nsection. \n \nIndigenous peoples. There are no indigenous peoples, as defined in ADB\u2019s Safeguard \n31. \nPolicy  Statement,  in  the  project  area,  and  the  project  will  be  classified  as  category  C  for \nindigenous peoples. \n \nF. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n32. \nThe  project  risks  are  considered  manageable  through  the  prescribed  mitigating \nmeasures,  and  the  integrated  benefits  and  impacts  are  expected  to  outweigh  the  costs  of \nmitigation.  Major  project  risks  and  mitigating  measures  are  summarized  in  Table  4  and \ndescribed in detail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.28 \n \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nRisks \nInitial delays in project \nimplementation \n\nMitigating Measures \nThe project design advance for detailed design was approved, and the \nconsultants mobilized in February 2016.
