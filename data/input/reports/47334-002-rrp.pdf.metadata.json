I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto India for Supporting Kerala\u2019s Additional Skill Acquisition Program in Post-Basic Education. \nThe report also describes the proposed administration of the technical assistance (TA) for \nCapacity Building for the Additional Skill Acquisition Program (ASAP) to be financed by the \nJapan Fund for Poverty Reduction, and if the Board approves the loan, I, acting under the \nauthority delegated to me by the Board, will approve the TA.1  \n \n2.  The proposed Asian Development Bank (ADB) assistance will support the efforts of the \nGovernment of Kerala\u2019s ASAP to complement post-basic education\u2014i.e., higher secondary \n(grades 11 and 12) and undergraduate levels\u2014with market-relevant vocational training and \ncareer counseling to enhance the employability of the youth (15\u201324 years old) and improve their \nemployment prospects.2  \n \nII.  THE PROGRAM \n \nA.  Strategic Context \n \n3.  Post-basic education prepares the youth for the world of work. However, in India, higher \nsecondary  schools  and  colleges  have  not  addressed  this  critical  link  adequately.  Their \ncurriculum and pedagogy have not kept pace with the structural changes in the economy, \nrequirements of the job market, and evolving youth aspirations. Even Kerala, which has the best \neducation and health indicators in India, is struggling with high levels of unemployment coupled \nwith  low  workforce  participation  rates,  particularly  among  women.3 In  2011\u20132012,  Kerala\u2019s \nunemployment rate was 7.4% as compared to the national average of 2.3%.4 Paradoxically, the \nunemployment rate in Kerala rises with the level of education. Recent estimates show that the \nunemployment rate was 6.1% for those with primary education, 12.4% for secondary school \ngraduates, 33.7% for higher secondary school graduates, and 26% for degree holders, with \nwomen forming the majority of the unemployed.5 \n \n4.  Kerala\u2019s problem of \u201ceducated unemployment\u201d reflects that its high literacy and school \nenrollment have not translated into the level of employability required by the  market. The \nmajority of Kerala\u2019s graduates lack fluency in English and familiarity with basic information \ntechnology (IT) skills\u2014two key requirements for most jobs today. They are not provided much \ncareer counseling; nor do they have access to good quality and relevant vocational training. \nBetween 2004 and 2011, while the share of the primary sector in Kerala\u2019s gross domestic \nproduct declined from 17.9% to 9.5%, and that of the secondary sector fell from 22.5% to \n20.2%, the share of the tertiary sector increased from 59.6% to 70.3%.6 However, Kerala\u2019s \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \n2  ADB provided a project preparatory technical assistance. ADB. 2013. Technical Assistance to India for Supporting \nthe Additional Skill Acquisition Program in Kerala. Manila. \n3  Kerala is the 12th largest state of India with a population of 33.3 million. According to the 2011 Census, Kerala\u2019s \nliteracy rate was 94%, against India\u2019s average of 73%. The gap between male and female literacy in Kerala was \n4% (96% for males and 92% for females) against India\u2019s overall gap of 16% (81% for males and 65% for females). \nKerala\u2019s infant mortality rate at 12 per 1,000 is the lowest in India. \n4  Government of India, Ministry of Statistics and Program Implementation. 2014.

Thiruvananthapuram.  \n6  The primary sector includes agriculture, forestry, and fishing; the secondary sector: construction, manufacturing, \nand mining and quarrying; and the tertiary sector: hospitality, transport and communication, trade, banking, \ninsurance, public administration, and other services.  ", "2 \nworkforce  has  not  been  able  to  adjust to  this  rapid  structural  change.  Nearly  32%  of the \nworkforce remains engaged in the low productivity primary sector and 29% in the secondary \nsector. Most of Kerala\u2019s current vocational training programs are government-run and focus on \ncourses  for  plumbers,  electricians,  fitters,  and  lathe  operators  which  offer  limited  job \nopportunities within Kerala. There are few training opportunities to prepare Kerala\u2019s youth for \nthe fast-growing  services  sector.  Consequently,  Kerala\u2019s graduates  are  unable to  compete \neffectively for modern jobs.  \n \n5.  In July 2012, the Government of Kerala launched the Kerala State Skill Development \nProject  to  enhance  the  employability  of  the  youth,  and  prepare  them  for  emerging  job \nopportunities within and outside the state. As part of this flagship project, ASAP has been \nlaunched by the Department of Higher Education (DOHE) and the Department of General \nEducation  to  provide  relevant  vocational  training  opportunities  to  grade  11  and  1st  year \nundergraduate students (i.e., post-basic education) after regular teaching hours and during \nvacations. This will increase employability of the students and make them market-ready by the \ntime they graduate thereby, addressing the problem of educated unemployment.7  \n \nB.  Program Rationale \n \n6.  The proposed loan reflects the priorities of the India country partnership strategy, 2013\u2013\n2017, which seeks to reinforce India\u2019s efforts toward inclusive growth and recognizes education, \nwith a focus on vocational training, as a new sector in ADB\u2019s India operations.8 It is aligned with \nthe Midterm Review of Strategy 2020, which emphasizes the need for ADB to expand education \nsector lending by focusing on post-basic education and vocational training to develop human \ncapital, and by facilitating public\u2012private partnerships (PPPs) to leverage results.9 \n \n7.  The  results-based  lending  (RBL)  modality  is  appropriate  for  ASAP.  Its  design  is \ninnovative and in line with the vision of India\u2019s National Skill Development Policy, 2009 and the \nrecommendations  of  the  Kerala  Skill-Gap  Study,  2013.10 There  is  strong  ownership  and \ncommitment of the state government. DOHE established the ASAP secretariat in July 2012 to \nconceptualize and implement the program. As of 1 July 2014, ASAP is being piloted in 437 \nschools and colleges. It has enrolled 15,899 students, 56% of them females. Since ASAP\u2019s \nimplementation  involves  multiple  stakeholders  (e.g.,  students,  trainers,  government \ndepartments, and industry partners) and diverse activities (e.g., industry engagement, youth \nmobilization,  training,  placement,  and  tracking of  outcomes),  the  RBL  modality  will  reduce \ntransaction costs and focus on results. Moreover, detailed assessments confirm that Kerala\u2019s \nfiduciary and safeguards systems are reasonably robust. The government has also agreed to \ntake measures to mitigate risk and improve its systems further. ADB will add value by improving \nASAP\u2019s design and implementation further so that the program can be scaled up effectively and \nsustainably. It will help to strengthen industry engagement, facilitate PPPs in skills training, and \nsupport tracer studies to monitor results. This approach of exposing students at the post-basic \neducation level to market-relevant vocational training could be replicated in other states of India \nthat are struggling with low youth employability and high unemployment rates. \n \n                                                \n7  The Additional Skill Enhancement Program, designed by Kerala\u2019s Department of Labor and Employment and the \nDepartment of Local Self Government, addresses the \u201ccurative\u201d aspect of the unemployment problem and focuses \non reskilling unemployed youths registered with employment exchanges. \n8  ADB. 2013.

The  RBL  program  will  help  ASAP  in  providing  Kerala\u2019s  higher  secondary  and \nundergraduate students, enrolled in government and government-aided schools and colleges, \nwith the opportunity to improve their English communication and basic IT and soft skills, and to \nlearn in-demand vocational skills outside regular hours and during vacations. It will help to scale \nup ASAP in a sustainable and results-oriented manner to nearly 900 schools and colleges \nacross Kerala so that coverage increases to 310,000 students. The RBL will cover the first \nphase of ASAP, under which level 1 vocational certification, equivalent to levels 3\u20135 (i.e., basic \ndiploma)  of  India\u2019s  National  Skills  Qualification  Framework,  will  be  provided.  From  2018 \nonwards,  the  state  government  plans  to  launch  the  second  phase  of  ASAP  under  which \ncertification at levels 2 and 3, equivalent to levels 6 and 7 (i.e., advanced diploma) of the \nNational Skills Qualification Framework, will be provided (Table 1).  \n \nTable 1: Program Scope  \nItem  Government Program (ASAP)  RBL Program \nOutcome  Increased employability of ASAP certificate  Same as ASAP \nholders    \n \nKey outputs   (i)  Market-relevant vocational training  (i)  Same as ASAP \n  introduced in post-basic education for   \nASAP level 1 certification (Phase 1)   \n(ii)  Market-relevant vocational training  (ii)  Phase 2 of ASAP not included \nintroduced in post-basic education for  under the RBL program \nASAP levels 2 to 3 certification (Phase 2)   \n(iii) Access to quality vocational training  (iii) Access to quality vocational \nenhanced (35 CSPs constructed and 140  training enhanced (35 CSPs \nSDCs renovated)  constructed and 30 SDCs \n  renovated) \n(iv) Increased awareness and private sector  (iv) Same as ASAP \nparticipation facilitated   \n(v)  Improved program management and M&E  (v)  Same as ASAP \n \nActivity types   (i)  Training for ASAP certification at levels 1,  (i)  Training for ASAP level 1 \n2, and 3   certification  \n(ii)  Kerala\u2019s training facilities expanded in line  (ii)  Same as ASAP \nwith market needs to facilitate private   \nparticipation    \n(iii) Outreach efforts  (iii) Same as ASAP \n(iv) Program management and M&E  (iv) Same as ASAP \n   \nProgram  $200 milliona  $147 million \nexpenditure   \n \nMain financiers  Government of Kerala  Government of Kerala (32%) \nand respective  Asian Development Bank (68%) \nshares  \n \nGeographic  Entire state of Kerala  Entire state of Kerala \ncoverage \n     \nImplementation \nFrom 2012\u20132022  2015\u20132018 \nperiod \nASAP = Additional Skill Acquisition Program, CSP = community skills park, M&E = monitoring and evaluation, RBL = \nresults-based lending, SDC = skill development center. \na  Government of Kerala estimate. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n ", "4 \nD.  Program Results \n \n9.  The impact of the proposed loan will be increased employment of Kerala\u2019s youth (aged \n15\u201324 years). The outcome will be increased employability of ASAP certificate holders.11 This \nwill be achieved through the following outputs:12  \n \n(i)  Output  1:  Market-relevant  vocational  training  introduced  in  post-basic \neducation.  This  will  support  foundation  training  of  180  hours  in  English \ncommunication  and  IT  skills  will  be  offered  to  higher  secondary  and \nundergraduate  students  after  regular  hours  and  on  holidays.  Students  who \ncomplete the foundation training will be able to choose from a menu of vocational \ncourses focusing on growing service sector jobs in banking and financial services, \nbusiness process outsourcing, customer support, health care, hospitality, printing, \nretail, telecommunication, media, and entertainment; and in emerging technology \nareas such as electronic product testing, optical fibre installation, and mobile \ncommunication.13 Vocational training will be provided during vacations. ASAP \nhas designed 33 courses (150 to 500 hours depending on the trade) to date \nbased on consultations with industry associations, sector skills councils (SSCs), \nand student surveys. The proposed loan will enable ASAP to introduce new \ncourses and update existing ones based on market demand (Disbursement-\nLinked  Indicator  [DLI]  2,  Program  Action  Plan  [PAP]  1),  strengthen  quality \nassurance, and support tracer studies to track improvement in employability and \nemployment outcomes (DLI 1, PAP 1 and 4). It will help ASAP in arranging \ninternships with industry to give exposure to the trainees. \n \n(ii)  Output 2: Access to quality vocational training enhanced. This will enhance \naccess to quality vocational training focusing on the service sector and emerging \ntechnology areas by supporting construction of 35 community skills parks (CSPs) \nand renovating 30 skill development centers (SDCs) (DLI 3). As noted in para. 4, \nthe existing industrial training institutes do not provide training in the trades which \nare increasingly relevant, considering the rapid growth in the share of the tertiary \nsector in Kerala\u2019s economy. Provision of modern training facilities with gender-\nfriendly design and easy access for the physically impaired will help to attract \nmore students (DLI 4) and private training providers (DLI 5), and improve the \nquality of training. PPP arrangements will be designed to outsource operation \nand maintenance of the CSPs to private operators (PAP 1.5). The proposed loan \nwill ensure that each of the 14 districts of Kerala gets four to five modern training \nfacilities on average. This will expand the training choices available to Kerala\u2019s \nyouth and help to counter the stigma attached to vocational training. \n \n(iii)  Output 3: Increased awareness and private sector participation facilitated. \nThis will help the ASAP secretariat in increasing awareness about the importance \nof combining post-basic education with relevant vocational training, providing \ncareer counseling to inform the students about job opportunities, and enhancing \n                                                \n11  Employability  will  be  assessed  through  various  channels,  e.g.,  feedback  from  firms  where  ASAP  trainees \nundertake internships, tracer studies, and employer surveys.  \n12  The key outputs are designated as DLIs. Those that are important for outcome achievement but difficult to link to \ndisbursement are included in the PAP (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n13 The demand analysis shows the need for an additional 6.7 million skilled workers in Kerala by 2018, with 70% in \nthe tertiary sector and 30% in the secondary sector. ASAP\u2019s vocational courses focus on the growth areas.  \n \n ", "5 \nstudent participation through outreach campaigns (DLI 4). Institutionalizing the \nengagement with industry associations and SSCs will facilitate private sector \nparticipation (DLI  5  and  PAP  1.2),  and  ensure  the  continued relevance  and \nquality of ASAP\u2019s training and certification.  \n \n(iv)  Output 4: Improved program management and monitoring and evaluation. \nThis will build the ASAP secretariat\u2019s capacity to manage the program effectively, \nstrengthen  monitoring  and  evaluation  (M&E),  undertake  tracer  studies,  and \nmainstream gender concerns (DLI 6, PAPs 2\u20136). ASAP will engage experienced \nstaff for strengthening the accounts, procurement, and safeguard functions.  \n \n10.  The disbursement allocation is in Table 2. Only six DLIs have been selected to focus on \nthe core outputs and results chain essential for realizing the desired outcome and impact from \nthe  perspective  of  the  beneficiaries.  They  provide  flexibility  and  scope  for  encouraging \ninnovations by the ASAP secretariat. Higher amounts are allocated to areas including quality, \nindustry engagement, training, and M&E which will benefit the ASAP trainees directly.  \n \nTable 2: Disbursement-Linked Indicators  \n  Disbursement  Share of Total \n  Allocated  ADB \nOutcome and/or Output  Indicator  ($ million)  Financing (%) \nOutcome       \nIncreased employability of  1.

Disbursement arrangements. The ADB loan will be disbursed over 4 years subject to \nthe  achievement  and  verification  of  the  DLIs.  The  initial  disbursement  will  be  after  loan \neffectiveness and upon verification of the prior results. DOHE has put in much effort and \nresources for launching ASAP. As of 1 July 2014, it has designed 33 relevant courses, enrolled \n15,899 students, engaged 101 program managers, prepared standard architectural designs for \nCSPs,  empaneled  1,167  skill  development  executives  to  conduct  foundation  training,  and \ninitiated recruitment of training providers. Since these actions, taken over a period of 1 year \nbefore loan effectivity, provide a strong foundation for scaling up ASAP effectively, 20% of the \nloan will be released against these prior results. The subsequent disbursements will be made \nannually after the corresponding DLIs are met. The ASAP secretariat will submit withdrawal \napplications along with evidence verifying the achievement of the DLIs, and unaudited financial \nstatements  for  the  period  concerned.  Any  amount  not  disbursed  for  unmet  DLIs  will  be \ndisbursed once they have been achieved. Partial disbursement is allowed for DLIs 1 and 3 as \nnoted in the verification protocol. The loan funds will flow from ADB to the special account \n ", "7 \nmaintained by the Controller of Aids, Account, and Audit of the Government of India. It will then \nbe transferred to the Finance Department of the state government, which will allocate it to \nDOHE. It will provide these funds to the ASAP secretariat for undertaking eligible expenditures. \n \nF.  Capacity Development and Program Action Plan \n \n15.  Capacity development support will be required to ensure that ASAP can be scaled up \neffectively and sustainably.14 This will focus on (i) conducting additional district and sector-\nspecific surveys to track market demand for skilled workers within and outside Kerala so that \nASAP\u2019s  course  offerings  can  be  updated  accordingly;  (ii)  mapping  the  demand  for  skilled \nworkers to the location of the proposed CSPs and SDCs to ensure that relevant menu of \ntraining courses are provided in these; (iii) forging strong partnerships with industries and SSCs \nto  increase  the  internship  and  placement  avenues  for  ASAP  trainees;  (iv)  designing  PPP \noptions  to  outsource  operation  and  maintenance  of  the  CSPs  to  private  operators;  (v) \nconducting tracer studies to monitor the effectiveness of ASAP\u2019s foundation and vocational \ntraining in terms of employability and employment outcomes; (vi) designing advanced vocational \ncourses to enable ASAP to offer higher-level certifications; (vii) mainstreaming gender concerns \nin vocational training; and (viii) documenting development results to facilitate cross-learning.  \n \n16.  A  PAP  has  been  developed  to  complement  the  DLI  matrix.  It  includes  actions  in \ntechnical areas, fiduciary management, M&E, safeguards, and gender to ensure that ASAP is \nimplemented  effectively  and  sustainably.  Since  Kerala\u2019s  own  systems  are  assessed  to  be \nrobust, the PAP will focus on strengthening these core functions within the ASAP secretariat.  \n \nG.  Technical Assistance \n \n17.  A $1.5 million accompanying capacity development TA, financed by the Japan Fund for \nPoverty Reduction, has been designed to support the outputs indicated in para. 15. The state \ngovernment will support the TA in the form of counterpart staff, limited office accommodation \nand supplies, and other in-kind contributions. \n \nH.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n18.  DOHE will be the executing agency and the ASAP secretariat has been constituted as \nthe implementing agency under DOHE. The State-Level Empowered Committee (chaired by the \nchief secretary, state government) guides the implementation of ASAP. The additional chief \nsecretary, DOHE is the convener of the Empowered Committee and the overall in charge of \nASAP. The additional secretary, DOHE is the head of the ASAP secretariat, and supervises \nprogram implementation. The secretariat has been in operation since July 2012. It has divisions \nfocusing on strategic design, technical aspects, finance, quality control, training and program \nmanagement,  communication,  research  and  documentation,  and  lifelong  learning.  The \nimplementation period of the proposed loan is 1 January 2014 to 31 December 2018.  \n \nIII.  SUMMARY OF ASSESSMENTS \n \nA.  Program Technical Assessments \n \n19.  Efforts of most state governments in India to make post-basic education more job-\noriented by offering career counseling and vocational training in parallel have not been effective \n                                                \n14  Attached Technical Assistance (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "8 \nowing to certain weaknesses. These include limited or no engagement with the private sector, \ninability to offer good quality training in relevant vocational trades, lack of awareness building, \nand outdated training facilities. The program assessment found that these lessons have been \nincorporated  into  ASAP\u2019s  design.  The  ASAP  secretariat  has  been  engaging  with  industry \nassociations and SSCs to identify relevant trades, design the courses and delivery methods, \norganize  internships,  and  establish  quality  standards.  It  has  signed  memoranda  of \nunderstanding with several SSCs (e.g., automotive, retail, plumbing, health care, and rubber). \nASAP\u2019s  outreach  campaigns  are  raising  awareness  about  the  opportunities  provided  by \nvocational training. Regular consultations are held with students to understand their needs and \naspirations. The vocational courses being offered by ASAP focus on the growth sectors, which \nalso match with students\u2019 aspirations.15 The foundation courses are offered after regular school \nand college hours for an average 3\u20134 hours a week, while the vocational courses are scheduled \nduring the vacations. This gives flexibility to the students to combine post-basic education with \nvocational training. Through its rigorous process of recruiting skill development executives, \nASAP is also building up a cadre of master trainers. The progress made by the secretariat in \nenrolling 15,899 students across 437 higher secondary schools and colleges and offering 33 \nmarket-relevant courses within 2 years underscores the strength of ASAP\u2019s design.     \n \n20.  The economic analysis, which is based on a review of sector-specific employment trends, \nconfirms ASAP\u2019s robustness.16 Given the concerted efforts of the ASAP secretariat to ensure \nthe quality and market-relevance of its training programs, it is assumed that ASAP certificate \nholders will secure a nominal premium of 10% to 20% on domestic jobs, and a premium of 20% \non corresponding overseas jobs, after having completed 1 to 2 years of domestic employment.17 \nThe economic rate of return ranges from 31% in the low case to 48% in the high case scenario.  \n \n21.  ASAP has a strong pro-poor and gender focus. For vocational courses costing up to \nRs10,000 (around $165 at prevailing exchange rate), disadvantaged students, who successfully \ncomplete  the  ASAP  training  and  get  a  certificate,  are  exempted  from  paying  the  fees.18 \nSuccessful students, who do not belong to disadvantaged groups, will pay 75% of the fee.19 \nStudents who do not complete the course will have to repay the entire fee in installments within \n3\u20135 years. By offering vocational training courses focusing on the growing service sectors, \nASAP will expand the career options for Kerala\u2019s women, within and outside the state. The \nnetwork of CSPs and SDCs to be established across the state will make it easier for women to \naccess quality training without having to travel far. By incorporating the different needs and \naspirations  of  women  and  men  in the  career counseling  and training  modules,  ASAP  will \npromote gender parity in workforce participation (PAP 5). The DLI matrix and PAP have sex-\ndisaggregated baseline and target indicators justifying the \u201cgender equity\u201d categorization.  \n \nB.  Program Systems Assessments \n \n22.  Monitoring and evaluation system. The M&E assessment confirms that ASAP\u2019s MIS \ncaptures sex-disaggregated data on beneficiaries, and will help in tracking the outputs and \noutcome. The ASAP program managers regularly interface with the trainees and trainers, and \nindustry representatives. This will supplement the quantitative data captured by the MIS with \n                                                \n15  Demand Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n16 Economic and Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n17 Since a large number of Keralites migrate out of India for jobs, the economic analysis assumes that a certain \nproportion of ASAP certificate holders will go overseas after 1 to 2 years of domestic employment.  \n18 Disadvantaged students include those below the poverty line and/or from socioeconomically backward groups.  \n19  For courses with fees above Rs10,000, the fee portion up to Rs10,000 will be treated similarly. All students will pay \nthe fee portion above Rs10,000 from their own sources.  \n ", "9 \nqualitative feedback. Industry-accredited experts will be engaged to monitor training sessions \nand improve the quality of trainers. The capacity development TA will support tracer studies to \nevaluate employability and employment outcomes (para. 15 and 17). \n \n23.  Fiduciary systems. The fiduciary assessment confirms that the state government\u2019s \nrules and procedures for financial management, procurement, and anticorruption are in line with \ncommonly accepted good practices. The Kerala Financial Code, 2008 provides the rules on \nfinancial procedures for government departments, including guidelines for procurement of goods \nand works. The ASAP secretariat has a separate Finance Unit with three full time staff. To \nmitigate potential risk and strengthen its financial management function further, the secretariat \nwill recruit a chartered accountant by the end of October 2014. The financial MIS is operational, \nand  all  payments  and  receipts  are  being  routed  through  it.  An  internal  auditor  has  been \nappointed. The Accountants General (Audit) of Kerala will undertake annual audits of ASAP. \nAudited financial statements will be submitted within 6 months of the end of the fiscal year.  \n \n24.  The  procurement  capacity  assessment  and  the  procurement  review  for  effective \nimplementation  confirm  that  the  government\u2019s  procurement  framework  is  aligned  with  the \nprinciples of competition, efficiency, economy, transparency, fairness, and equal opportunity.20 \nASAP uses an e-procurement web portal to procure goods and consultants.21 However, to \nprepare for the scaling up of ASAP under the proposed loan and mitigate potential risk, the \nASAP secretariat will create a dedicated procurement unit, and recruit a procurement specialist \nby the end of October 2014. Additional staff will be recruited as required. They will focus solely \non procurement to avoid any conflict of interest. The Guidelines to Prevent or Mitigate Fraud, \nCorruption,  and  Other  Prohibited  Activities  in  Results-Based  Lending  for  Programs  were \nexplained to and discussed with the government and DOHE.22 \n \n25.  Safeguard systems. Construction of CSPs and upgrades of SDCs will take place only \non vacant land available within premises owned by the state government. No new land will be \nacquired, nor will anyone be displaced in anticipation of ADB funding. The loan is categorized \nas C for involuntary resettlement and B for environment. Since indigenous people constitute \nonly  1%  of  Kerala\u2019s  population,  the  categorization  is  C for  indigenous  people.  A  program \nsafeguard systems assessment has been prepared to bridge the gaps between the national \nenvironmental regulatory framework and ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009).23 Since the \nproposed subprojects (i.e., construction of CSPs) will cover built-up area of less than 20,000 \nsquare feet, the national environment framework does not require an environmental impact \nassessment, disclosure of initial environmental examination, or an environmental management \nplan on the part of the contractors. The ASAP secretariat has prepared an environmental and \nsocial management framework to fill the gaps and ensure compliance with the principles of the \nSafeguard Policy Statement (2009). All sites will be screened and environmental measures \nundertaken to mitigate noise, dust, and possible obstruction of drainage during construction. \nThe ASAP secretariat will recruit an environment safeguard officer to ensure compliance.  \n \n \n \n                                                \n20  Procurement Capacity Assessment and Procurement Review for Effective Implementation (accessible from the list \nof linked documents in Appendix 2). \n21  Procurement involving high-value contracts, where the value exceeds the amounts specified in ADB's policy on \nRBL, will be excluded.

It depends on a mix of factors: (i) a person\u2019s basic education; (ii) vocational skills relative to \nthe needs of a particular job or market environment; (iii) awareness of and ability to access relevant job opportunities; and (iv) soft skills including interpersonal \nskills, work ethics, and fluency in the main business language. It is context-specific and affected by both supply and demand-side factors. Most ASAP certificate \nholders will not look for jobs immediately because they may wish to complete their education. Under the accompanying capacity building technical assistance, an \nindex of employability will be designed and tested. It will draw on multiple sources \u2014 feedback from firms where ASAP trainees undertake internships, employer \nsurveys, and tracer studies to establish a baseline (by 2016). This will be tracked over time to assess and improve the effectiveness of ASAP\u2019s design and \nimplementation so that the overall employability of its certificate holders improves. ASAP certificate holders, who wish to look for jobs soon after getting their \ncertificates instead of continuing with higher education, will be tracked to assess whether or not they are able to get placed within a reasonable time. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n   \n ", "    Appendix 3  17 \n \nTable A3.2: Verification Protocols \n \nDisbursement-Linked  Definition and   Information Source  Verification Agency  Verification Time \nIndicators  Description of Achievement  and Frequency  and Procedure  Frame \nOutcome: Increased employability of ASAP certificate holders  \nDLI 1: Increase in the  Percentage of ASAP trainees certified  (i) ASAP annual report,  Third-party validation  Evaluation reports of \nemployability rate of ASAP  as employable by firms offering  which consolidates  agency will be  firms offering \nmale and female trainees  internships   evaluation on  engaged by ASAP  internships (by July) \nover the 2016 baseline    employability of ASAP  using loan funds   \n  Employability is defined as ASAP  students by the firms    ASAP\u2019s DLI \ncertificate holders having skills  offering internships.
