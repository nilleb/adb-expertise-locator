However, in India, higher \nsecondary  schools  and  colleges  have  not  addressed  this  critical  link  adequately.  Their \ncurriculum  and  pedagogy  have  not  kept  pace  with  the  structural  changes  in  the  economy, \nrequirements of the job market, and evolving youth aspirations. Even Kerala, which has the best \neducation and health indicators in India, is struggling with high levels of unemployment coupled \nwith  low  workforce  participation  rates,  particularly  among  women. 3  In  2011\u20132012,  Kerala\u2019s \nunemployment rate was 7.4% as compared to the national average of 2.3%.4 Paradoxically, the \nunemployment rate in Kerala rises with the level of education. Recent estimates show that the \nunemployment  rate  was  6.1%  for  those  with  primary  education,  12.4%  for  secondary  school \ngraduates,  33.7%  for  higher  secondary  school  graduates,  and  26%  for  degree  holders,  with \nwomen forming the majority of the unemployed.5 \n \n4. \nKerala\u2019s  problem  of  \u201ceducated  unemployment\u201d  reflects  that  its  high  literacy  and  school \nenrollment  have  not  translated  into  the  level  of  employability  required  by  the  market.  The \nmajority  of  Kerala\u2019s  graduates  lack  fluency  in  English  and  familiarity  with  basic  information \ntechnology (IT) skills\u2014two key requirements for most jobs today. They are not provided much \ncareer  counseling;  nor  do  they  have  access  to  good  quality  and  relevant  vocational  training. \nBetween  2004  and  2011,  while  the  share  of  the  primary  sector  in  Kerala\u2019s  gross  domestic \nproduct  declined  from  17.9%  to  9.5%,  and  that  of  the  secondary  sector  fell  from  22.5%  to \n20.2%,  the  share  of  the  tertiary  sector  increased  from  59.6%  to  70.3%.6 However,  Kerala\u2019s \n\n                                                \n1   The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \n2   ADB provided a project preparatory technical assistance. ADB. 2013. Technical Assistance to India for Supporting \n\nthe Additional Skill Acquisition Program in Kerala. Manila. \n\n3   Kerala is the 12th largest state of India with a population of 33.3 million.  According to the 2011 Census, Kerala\u2019s \nliteracy rate was 94%, against India\u2019s average of 73%. The gap between male and female literacy in Kerala was \n4% (96% for males and 92% for females) against India\u2019s overall gap of 16% (81% for males and 65% for females). \nKerala\u2019s infant mortality rate at 12 per 1,000 is the lowest in India. \n\n4   Government  of  India,  Ministry  of  Statistics  and  Program  Implementation.  2014.  National  Sample  Survey,  68th \n\nRound, 2011\u20122012. New Delhi. \n\n5   Government of Kerala. 2012. Kerala State Skill Development Preliminary Report, 2012. Thiruvananthapuram.  \n6   The  primary  sector  includes  agriculture,  forestry,  and  fishing;  the  secondary  sector:  construction,  manufacturing, \nand  mining  and  quarrying;  and  the  tertiary  sector:  hospitality,  transport  and  communication,  trade,  banking, \ninsurance, public administration, and other services.  \n\n\f2 \n\nProgram Rationale \n\nworkforce  has  not  been  able  to  adjust  to  this  rapid  structural  change.  Nearly  32%  of  the \nworkforce  remains  engaged  in  the  low  productivity  primary  sector  and  29%  in  the  secondary \nsector. Most of Kerala\u2019s current vocational training programs are government-run and focus on \ncourses  for  plumbers,  electricians,  fitters,  and  lathe  operators  which  offer  limited  job \nopportunities  within  Kerala.  There  are  few  training  opportunities  to  prepare  Kerala\u2019s  youth  for \nthe  fast-growing  services  sector.  Consequently,  Kerala\u2019s  graduates  are  unable  to  compete \neffectively for modern jobs.  \n \nIn  July  2012,  the  Government  of  Kerala  launched  the  Kerala  State  Skill  Development \n5. \nProject  to  enhance  the  employability  of  the  youth,  and  prepare  them  for  emerging  job \nopportunities  within  and  outside  the  state.  As  part  of  this  flagship  project,  ASAP  has  been \nlaunched  by  the  Department  of  Higher  Education  (DOHE)  and  the  Department  of  General \nEducation  to  provide  relevant  vocational  training  opportunities  to  grade  11  and  1st  year \nundergraduate  students  (i.e.,  post-basic  education)  after  regular  teaching  hours  and  during \nvacations. This will increase employability of the students and make them market-ready by the \ntime they graduate thereby, addressing the problem of educated unemployment.7  \n \nB. \n \n6. \nThe proposed loan reflects the priorities of the India country partnership strategy, 2013\u2013\n2017, which seeks to reinforce India\u2019s efforts toward inclusive growth and recognizes education, \nwith a focus on vocational training, as a new sector in ADB\u2019s India operations.8 It is aligned with \nthe Midterm Review of Strategy 2020, which emphasizes the need for ADB to expand education \nsector  lending  by  focusing  on  post-basic  education  and  vocational  training  to  develop  human \ncapital, and by facilitating public\u2012private partnerships (PPPs) to leverage results.9 \n \n7. \nThe  results-based  lending  (RBL)  modality  is  appropriate  for  ASAP.  Its  design  is \ninnovative and in line with the vision of India\u2019s National Skill Development Policy, 2009 and the \nrecommendations  of  the  Kerala  Skill-Gap  Study,  2013. 10  There  is  strong  ownership  and \ncommitment  of  the  state government.  DOHE  established the  ASAP  secretariat  in July  2012 to \nconceptualize  and  implement  the  program.  As  of  1  July  2014,  ASAP  is  being  piloted  in  437 \nschools  and  colleges.  It  has  enrolled  15,899  students,  56%  of  them  females.  Since  ASAP\u2019s \ntrainers,  government \nimplementation \ndepartments,  and  industry  partners)  and  diverse  activities  (e.g.,  industry  engagement,  youth \nmobilization,  training,  placement,  and  tracking  of  outcomes),  the  RBL  modality  will  reduce \ntransaction  costs  and  focus  on  results.  Moreover,  detailed  assessments  confirm  that  Kerala\u2019s \nfiduciary  and  safeguards  systems  are  reasonably  robust.  The  government  has  also  agreed  to \ntake measures to mitigate risk and improve its systems further. ADB will add value by improving \nASAP\u2019s design and implementation further so that the program can be scaled up effectively and \nsustainably. It will help to strengthen industry engagement, facilitate PPPs in skills training, and \nsupport tracer studies to monitor results. This approach of exposing students at the post-basic \neducation level to market-relevant vocational training could be replicated in other states of India \nthat are struggling with low youth employability and high unemployment rates. \n \n\ninvolves  multiple  stakeholders \n\n(e.g.,  students, \n\n                                                \n7   The Additional Skill Enhancement Program, designed by  Kerala\u2019s Department of Labor and Employment and the \nDepartment of Local Self Government, addresses the \u201ccurative\u201d aspect of the unemployment problem and focuses \non reskilling unemployed youths registered with employment exchanges. \n\n8   ADB. 2013.

It will help to scale \nup  ASAP  in  a  sustainable  and  results-oriented  manner  to  nearly  900  schools  and  colleges \nacross  Kerala  so  that  coverage  increases  to  310,000  students.  The  RBL  will  cover  the  first \nphase of ASAP, under which level 1 vocational certification, equivalent to levels 3\u20135 (i.e., basic \ndiploma)  of  India\u2019s  National  Skills  Qualification  Framework,  will  be  provided.  From  2018 \nonwards,  the  state  government  plans  to  launch  the  second  phase  of  ASAP  under  which \ncertification  at  levels  2  and  3,  equivalent  to  levels  6  and  7  (i.e.,  advanced  diploma)  of  the \nNational Skills Qualification Framework, will be provided (Table 1).  \n \n\nItem \nOutcome \n\nKey outputs  \n \n\nTable 1: Program Scope  \n\nGovernment Program (ASAP) \n\nRBL Program \n\nIncreased employability of ASAP certificate \nholders  \n \n(i)  Market-relevant vocational training \n\nintroduced in post-basic education for \nASAP level 1 certification (Phase 1) \n\n(ii)  Market-relevant vocational training \n\nSame as ASAP \n \n\n(i)  Same as ASAP \n \n \n(ii)  Phase 2 of ASAP not included \n\nintroduced in post-basic education for \nASAP levels 2 to 3 certification (Phase 2) \n\nunder the RBL program \n \n\n(iii)  Access to quality vocational training \n\nenhanced (35 CSPs constructed and 140 \nSDCs renovated) \n \n\n(iv)  Increased awareness and private sector \n\n(iii)  Access to quality vocational \ntraining enhanced (35 CSPs \nconstructed and 30 SDCs \nrenovated) \n(iv)  Same as ASAP \n\nparticipation facilitated \n\n \n\n(v)  Improved program management and M&E \n\n(v)  Same as ASAP \n\n \n\n \n\n2, and 3  \n\n(ii)  Kerala\u2019s training facilities expanded in line \nwith market needs to facilitate private \nparticipation  \n(iii)  Outreach efforts \n(iv)  Program management and M&E \n\ncertification  \n(ii)  Same as ASAP \n \n \n(iii)  Same as ASAP \n(iv)  Same as ASAP \n \n$147 million \n\nActivity types  \n\n(i)  Training for ASAP certification at levels 1, \n\n(i)  Training for ASAP level 1 \n\n$200 milliona \n \n\nGovernment of Kerala \n\nProgram \nexpenditure \n \nMain financiers \nand respective \nshares  \n \nGeographic \ncoverage \n \nImplementation \nperiod \nASAP = Additional Skill Acquisition Program, CSP = community skills park,  M&E = monitoring and evaluation, RBL = \nresults-based lending, SDC = skill development center. \na  Government of Kerala estimate. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n\nGovernment of Kerala (32%) \nAsian Development Bank (68%) \n\n \nFrom 2012\u20132022 \n\n \n2015\u20132018 \n\nEntire state of Kerala \n\nEntire state of Kerala \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\fProgram Results \n\nD. \n \n9. \nThe impact of the proposed loan will be increased employment of Kerala\u2019s youth (aged \n15\u201324  years).  The  outcome  will  be  increased  employability  of  ASAP  certificate  holders.11 This \nwill be achieved through the following outputs:12  \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nIT  skills  will  be  offered \n\nOutput  1:  Market-relevant  vocational  training  introduced  in  post-basic \neducation.  This  will  support  foundation  training  of  180  hours  in  English \nto  higher  secondary  and \ncommunication  and \nundergraduate  students  after  regular  hours  and  on  holidays.  Students  who \ncomplete the foundation training will be able to choose from a menu of vocational \ncourses focusing on growing service sector jobs in banking and financial services, \nbusiness process outsourcing, customer support, health care, hospitality, printing, \nretail, telecommunication, media, and entertainment; and in emerging technology \nareas  such  as  electronic  product  testing,  optical  fibre  installation,  and  mobile \ncommunication. 13 Vocational  training  will  be  provided  during  vacations.  ASAP \nhas  designed  33  courses  (150  to  500  hours  depending  on  the  trade)  to  date \nbased on consultations with industry associations, sector skills councils (SSCs), \nand  student  surveys.  The  proposed  loan  will  enable  ASAP  to  introduce  new \ncourses  and  update  existing  ones  based  on  market  demand  (Disbursement-\nLinked  Indicator  [DLI]  2,  Program  Action  Plan  [PAP]  1),  strengthen  quality \nassurance, and support tracer studies to track improvement in employability and \nemployment  outcomes  (DLI  1,  PAP  1  and  4).  It  will  help  ASAP  in  arranging \ninternships with industry to give exposure to the trainees. \n \nOutput 2:  Access to quality vocational training enhanced. This will enhance \naccess to quality vocational training focusing on the service sector and emerging \ntechnology areas by supporting construction of 35 community skills parks (CSPs) \nand renovating 30 skill development centers (SDCs) (DLI 3). As noted in para. 4, \nthe existing industrial training institutes do not provide training in the trades which \nare increasingly relevant, considering the rapid growth in the share of the tertiary \nsector  in  Kerala\u2019s  economy.  Provision  of  modern  training  facilities  with  gender-\nfriendly  design  and  easy  access  for  the  physically  impaired  will  help  to  attract \nmore  students  (DLI  4)  and  private  training  providers  (DLI  5),  and  improve  the \nquality  of  training.  PPP  arrangements  will  be  designed  to  outsource  operation \nand maintenance of the CSPs to private operators (PAP 1.5). The proposed loan \nwill ensure that each of the 14 districts of Kerala gets four to five modern training \nfacilities  on  average.  This  will  expand  the  training  choices  available  to  Kerala\u2019s \nyouth and help to counter the stigma attached to vocational training. \n \nOutput  3: Increased awareness  and private sector  participation  facilitated. \nThis will help the ASAP secretariat in increasing awareness about the importance \nof  combining  post-basic  education  with  relevant  vocational  training,  providing \ncareer counseling to inform the students about job opportunities, and enhancing \n\n                                                \n11  Employability  will  be  assessed  through  various  channels,  e.g.,  feedback  from  firms  where  ASAP  trainees \n\nundertake internships, tracer studies, and employer surveys.  \n\n12  The key outputs are designated as DLIs. Those that are important for outcome achievement but difficult to link to \n\ndisbursement are included in the PAP (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n13 The demand analysis shows the need for an additional 6.7 million skilled  workers in Kerala by 2018, with 70% in \n\nthe tertiary sector and 30% in the secondary sector. ASAP\u2019s vocational courses focus on the growth areas.  \n\n4 \n\n \n\n \n\n\f(iv) \n\nstudent  participation  through  outreach  campaigns  (DLI  4).  Institutionalizing  the \nengagement  with  industry  associations  and  SSCs  will  facilitate  private  sector \nparticipation  (DLI  5  and  PAP  1.2),  and  ensure  the  continued  relevance  and \nquality of ASAP\u2019s training and certification.  \n \nOutput  4:  Improved  program  management  and  monitoring  and  evaluation. \nThis will build the ASAP secretariat\u2019s capacity to manage the program effectively, \nstrengthen  monitoring  and  evaluation  (M&E),  undertake  tracer  studies,  and \nmainstream gender concerns (DLI 6, PAPs 2\u20136). ASAP will engage experienced \nstaff for strengthening the accounts, procurement, and safeguard functions.  \n \n\n10. \nThe disbursement allocation is in Table 2. Only six DLIs have been selected to focus on \nthe core outputs and results chain essential for realizing the desired outcome and impact from \nthe  perspective  of  the  beneficiaries.  They  provide  flexibility  and  scope  for  encouraging \ninnovations  by  the  ASAP  secretariat.  Higher  amounts  are  allocated  to  areas  including  quality, \nindustry engagement, training, and M&E which will benefit the ASAP trainees directly.  \n \n\nTable 2: Disbursement-Linked Indicators  \n\nDisbursement \nAllocated \n($ million) \n \n10.0 \n\nShare of Total \nADB \nFinancing (%) \n \n10.0 \n\nOutcome and/or Output \nOutcome \nIncreased employability of \nASAP certificate holders  \n\nOutput 1 \nMarket-relevant vocational \ntraining introduced in post-\nbasic education \n\nOutput 2 \nAccess to quality vocational \ntraining enhanced \n\nOutput 3 \nIncreased awareness and \nprivate sector participation \nfacilitated \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nOutput 4 \nImproved program \nmanagement and M&E \n\n \n \n\n \n\nIndicator \n\n \n1.

The state government will provide $47 million for the RBL program. \nThe  Government  of  India  has  requested  a  loan  of  $100  million  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital \nresources  to  finance  the  RBL  program.  The  loan  terms  and  conditions  are  in  para.  28.

The ADB loan will be disbursed over 4 years subject to \nthe  achievement  and  verification  of  the  DLIs.  The  initial  disbursement  will  be  after  loan \neffectiveness  and  upon  verification  of  the  prior  results.  DOHE  has  put  in  much  effort  and \nresources for launching ASAP. As of 1 July 2014, it has designed 33 relevant courses, enrolled \n15,899 students, engaged 101 program managers, prepared standard architectural designs for \nCSPs,  empaneled  1,167  skill  development  executives  to  conduct  foundation  training,  and \ninitiated  recruitment  of  training  providers.  Since  these  actions,  taken  over  a  period  of  1  year \nbefore loan effectivity, provide a strong foundation for scaling up ASAP effectively, 20% of the \nloan  will  be  released  against  these  prior  results.  The  subsequent  disbursements  will  be  made \nannually  after  the  corresponding  DLIs  are  met.  The  ASAP  secretariat  will  submit  withdrawal \napplications along with evidence verifying the achievement of the DLIs, and unaudited financial \nstatements  for  the  period  concerned.  Any  amount  not  disbursed  for  unmet  DLIs  will  be \ndisbursed  once they  have  been  achieved.  Partial  disbursement  is  allowed for  DLIs 1 and  3 as \nnoted  in  the  verification  protocol.  The  loan  funds  will  flow  from  ADB  to  the  special  account \n\n6 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fCapacity Development and Program Action Plan \n\nmaintained by the Controller of Aids, Account, and Audit of the Government of India. It will then \nbe  transferred  to  the  Finance  Department  of  the  state  government,  which  will  allocate  it  to \nDOHE. It will provide these funds to the ASAP secretariat for undertaking eligible expenditures. \n \nF. \n \n15. \nCapacity  development  support  will  be  required  to  ensure  that  ASAP  can  be  scaled  up \neffectively  and  sustainably. 14 This  will  focus  on  (i)  conducting  additional  district  and  sector-\nspecific  surveys  to  track  market  demand  for  skilled  workers  within  and  outside  Kerala  so  that \nASAP\u2019s  course  offerings  can  be  updated  accordingly;  (ii)  mapping  the  demand  for  skilled \nworkers  to  the  location  of  the  proposed  CSPs  and  SDCs  to  ensure  that  relevant  menu  of \ntraining courses are provided in these; (iii) forging strong partnerships with industries and SSCs \nto  increase  the  internship  and  placement  avenues  for  ASAP  trainees;  (iv)  designing  PPP \noptions  to  outsource  operation  and  maintenance  of  the  CSPs  to  private  operators;  (v) \nconducting  tracer  studies  to  monitor  the  effectiveness  of  ASAP\u2019s  foundation  and  vocational \ntraining in terms of employability and employment outcomes; (vi) designing advanced vocational \ncourses to enable ASAP to offer higher-level certifications; (vii) mainstreaming gender concerns \nin vocational training; and (viii) documenting development results to facilitate cross-learning.  \n \n16. \nA  PAP  has  been  developed  to  complement  the  DLI  matrix.  It  includes  actions  in \ntechnical  areas,  fiduciary  management,  M&E,  safeguards,  and  gender  to  ensure  that  ASAP  is \nimplemented  effectively  and  sustainably.  Since  Kerala\u2019s  own  systems  are  assessed  to  be \nrobust, the PAP will focus on strengthening these core functions within the ASAP secretariat.  \n \nG. \n \n17. \nA $1.5 million accompanying capacity development TA, financed by the Japan Fund for \nPoverty  Reduction,  has been  designed  to support the  outputs  indicated  in  para.  15. The  state \ngovernment  will  support  the  TA  in  the  form  of  counterpart  staff,  limited  office  accommodation \nand supplies, and other in-kind contributions. \n \nH. \n \n18. \nDOHE  will  be  the  executing  agency  and  the  ASAP  secretariat  has  been  constituted  as \nthe implementing agency under DOHE. The State-Level Empowered Committee (chaired by the \nchief  secretary,  state  government)  guides  the  implementation  of  ASAP.  The  additional  chief \nsecretary,  DOHE  is  the  convener  of  the  Empowered  Committee  and  the  overall  in  charge  of \nASAP.  The  additional  secretary,  DOHE  is  the  head  of  the  ASAP  secretariat,  and  supervises \nprogram implementation. The secretariat has been in operation since July 2012. It has divisions \nfocusing  on  strategic  design,  technical  aspects,  finance,  quality  control,  training  and  program \nlearning.  The \nmanagement,  communication,  research  and  documentation,  and \nimplementation period of the proposed loan is 1 January 2014 to 31 December 2018.  \n \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nTechnical Assistance \n\nlifelong \n\nIII. \n\nSUMMARY OF ASSESSMENTS \n\nProgram Technical Assessments \n\n \nA. \n \n19. \nEfforts  of  most  state  governments  in  India  to  make  post-basic  education  more  job-\noriented by offering career counseling and vocational training in parallel have not been effective \n\n                                                \n14  Attached Technical Assistance (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\ninternships,  and  establish  quality  standards. \n\nowing to certain weaknesses. These include limited or no engagement with the private sector, \ninability  to offer  good quality  training  in relevant  vocational  trades,  lack  of  awareness building, \nand  outdated  training  facilities.  The  program  assessment  found  that  these  lessons  have  been \nincorporated  into  ASAP\u2019s  design.  The  ASAP  secretariat  has  been  engaging  with  industry \nassociations  and  SSCs  to  identify  relevant  trades,  design  the  courses  and  delivery  methods, \norganize \nIt  has  signed  memoranda  of \nunderstanding  with  several  SSCs  (e.g.,  automotive,  retail,  plumbing,  health  care,  and  rubber). \nASAP\u2019s  outreach  campaigns  are  raising  awareness  about  the  opportunities  provided  by \nvocational training. Regular consultations are held with students to understand their needs and \naspirations. The vocational courses being offered by ASAP focus on the growth sectors, which \nalso match with students\u2019 aspirations.15 The foundation courses are offered after regular school \nand college hours for an average 3\u20134 hours a week, while the vocational courses are scheduled \nduring the vacations. This gives flexibility to the students to combine post-basic education with \nvocational  training.  Through  its  rigorous  process  of  recruiting  skill  development  executives, \nASAP  is  also  building  up  a  cadre  of  master  trainers.  The  progress  made  by  the  secretariat  in \nenrolling  15,899  students  across  437  higher  secondary  schools  and  colleges  and  offering  33 \nmarket-relevant courses within 2 years underscores the strength of ASAP\u2019s design.     \n \n20. \nThe economic analysis, which is based on a review of sector-specific employment trends, \nconfirms  ASAP\u2019s  robustness.16 Given  the  concerted  efforts  of  the  ASAP  secretariat  to  ensure \nthe  quality  and  market-relevance  of  its  training  programs,  it  is  assumed  that  ASAP  certificate \nholders will secure a nominal premium of 10% to 20% on domestic jobs, and a premium of 20% \non corresponding overseas jobs, after having completed 1 to 2 years of domestic employment.17 \nThe economic rate of return ranges from 31% in the low case to 48% in the high case scenario.  \n \n21. \nASAP  has  a  strong  pro-poor  and  gender  focus.  For  vocational  courses  costing  up  to \nRs10,000 (around $165 at prevailing exchange rate), disadvantaged students, who successfully \ncomplete  the  ASAP  training  and  get  a  certificate,  are  exempted  from  paying  the  fees. 18 \nSuccessful  students,  who  do  not  belong  to  disadvantaged  groups,  will  pay  75%  of  the  fee.19 \nStudents who do not complete the course will have to repay the entire fee in installments within \n3\u20135  years.  By  offering  vocational  training  courses  focusing  on  the  growing  service  sectors, \nASAP  will  expand  the  career  options  for  Kerala\u2019s  women,  within  and  outside  the  state.  The \nnetwork of CSPs and SDCs to be established across the state will make it easier for women to \naccess  quality  training  without  having  to  travel  far.  By  incorporating  the  different  needs  and \naspirations  of  women  and  men  in  the  career  counseling  and  training  modules,  ASAP  will \npromote  gender  parity  in  workforce  participation  (PAP  5).  The  DLI  matrix  and  PAP  have  sex-\ndisaggregated baseline and target indicators justifying the \u201cgender equity\u201d categorization.  \n \nB. \n \n22.  Monitoring  and  evaluation  system.  The M&E assessment confirms that ASAP\u2019s MIS \ncaptures  sex-disaggregated  data  on  beneficiaries,  and  will  help  in  tracking  the  outputs  and \noutcome. The  ASAP  program  managers regularly  interface  with the  trainees  and trainers,  and \nindustry  representatives.  This  will  supplement  the  quantitative  data  captured  by  the  MIS  with \n\nProgram Systems Assessments \n\n                                                \n15  Demand Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n16 Economic and Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n17 Since  a  large  number  of  Keralites  migrate  out  of  India  for  jobs,  the  economic  analysis  assumes  that  a  certain \n\nproportion of ASAP certificate holders will go overseas after 1 to 2 years of domestic employment.  \n\n18 Disadvantaged students include those below the poverty line and/or from socioeconomically backward groups.  \n19  For courses with fees above Rs10,000, the fee portion up to Rs10,000 will be treated similarly. All students will pay \n\nthe fee portion above Rs10,000 from their own sources.  \n\n\fqualitative  feedback.  Industry-accredited  experts  will  be  engaged  to  monitor  training  sessions \nand improve the quality of trainers. The capacity development TA will support tracer studies to \nevaluate employability and employment outcomes (para. 15 and 17). \n \nFiduciary  systems.  The  fiduciary  assessment  confirms  that  the  state  government\u2019s \n23. \nrules and procedures for financial management, procurement, and anticorruption are in line with \ncommonly  accepted  good  practices.  The  Kerala  Financial  Code,  2008  provides  the  rules  on \nfinancial procedures for government departments, including guidelines for procurement of goods \nand  works.  The  ASAP  secretariat  has  a  separate  Finance  Unit  with  three  full  time  staff.  To \nmitigate  potential risk  and  strengthen  its financial management function further, the  secretariat \nwill recruit a chartered accountant by the end of October 2014. The financial MIS is operational, \nand  all  payments  and  receipts  are  being  routed  through  it.  An  internal  auditor  has  been \nappointed.  The  Accountants  General  (Audit)  of  Kerala  will  undertake  annual  audits  of  ASAP. \nAudited financial statements will be submitted within 6 months of the end of the fiscal year.  \n \n24. \nThe  procurement  capacity  assessment  and  the  procurement  review  for  effective \nimplementation  confirm  that  the  government\u2019s  procurement  framework  is  aligned  with  the \nprinciples of competition,  efficiency,  economy,  transparency, fairness,  and equal  opportunity.20 \nASAP  uses  an  e-procurement  web  portal  to  procure  goods  and  consultants. 21 However,  to \nprepare  for  the  scaling  up  of  ASAP  under  the  proposed  loan  and  mitigate  potential  risk,  the \nASAP secretariat will create a dedicated procurement unit, and recruit a procurement specialist \nby the end of October 2014. Additional staff will be recruited as required. They will focus solely \non  procurement  to avoid  any  conflict  of  interest.  The  Guidelines  to  Prevent  or  Mitigate  Fraud, \nCorruption,  and  Other  Prohibited  Activities  in  Results-Based  Lending  for  Programs  were \nexplained to and discussed with the government and DOHE.22 \n \n25. \nSafeguard  systems.  Construction of CSPs and upgrades of SDCs will take place only \non vacant land available within premises owned by the state government. No new land will be \nacquired, nor will anyone be displaced in anticipation of ADB funding. The loan is categorized \nas  C  for  involuntary  resettlement  and  B  for  environment.  Since  indigenous  people  constitute \nonly  1%  of  Kerala\u2019s  population,  the  categorization  is  C  for  indigenous  people.  A  program \nsafeguard  systems  assessment  has  been  prepared  to  bridge  the  gaps  between  the  national \nenvironmental regulatory framework and ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009).23 Since the \nproposed  subprojects  (i.e.,  construction  of  CSPs)  will  cover  built-up  area  of  less  than  20,000 \nsquare  feet,  the  national  environment  framework  does  not  require  an  environmental  impact \nassessment, disclosure of initial environmental examination, or an environmental management \nplan  on the  part  of the contractors.  The  ASAP secretariat  has  prepared an  environmental  and \nsocial management framework to fill the gaps and ensure compliance with the principles  of the \nSafeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009).  All  sites  will  be  screened  and  environmental  measures \nundertaken  to  mitigate  noise,  dust,  and  possible  obstruction  of  drainage  during  construction. \nThe ASAP secretariat will recruit an environment safeguard officer to ensure compliance.  \n \n \n \n\n                                                \n20  Procurement Capacity Assessment and Procurement Review for Effective Implementation (accessible from the list \n\nof linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n21  Procurement  involving  high-value  contracts,  where  the  value  exceeds  the  amounts  specified  in  ADB's  policy  on \n\nRBL, will be excluded.

It depends on a mix of factors: (i) a person\u2019s basic education; (ii) vocational skills relative to \nthe needs of a particular job or market environment; (iii) awareness of and ability to access relevant job opportunities; and (iv) soft skills including interpersonal \nskills, work ethics, and fluency in the main business language. It is context-specific and affected by both supply and demand-side factors. Most ASAP certificate \nholders will not look for jobs immediately because they may wish to complete their education. Under the accompanying capacity building  technical assistance, an \nindex of employability will be designed and tested. It will draw on multiple sources  \u2014 feedback from firms where ASAP trainees undertake internships, employer \nsurveys,  and  tracer  studies  to  establish  a  baseline  (by  2016).  This  will  be  tracked  over  time  to  assess  and  improve  the  effectiveness  of  ASAP\u2019s  design  and \nimplementation  so  that  the  overall  employability  of  its  certificate  holders  improves.  ASAP  certificate  holders,  who  wish  to  look  for  jobs  soon  after  getting  their \ncertificates instead of continuing with higher education, will be tracked to assess whether or not they are able to get placed within a reasonable time. \n\n173,058 \n(female = \n60%, \ndisadvantaged \n= 60%) \n\n2,000 \n \n\n1,500 \n \n\n1,750 \n \n\n1,200 \n\n18 \n\n12 \n\n20 \n\n15 \n\n\u2014 \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nTable A3.2: Verification Protocols \n \n\n \n\n \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n17 \n\nInformation Source \nand Frequency \n\nVerification Agency \nand Procedure \n\nVerification Time \nFrame \n\n(i) ASAP annual report, \nwhich consolidates \nevaluation on \nemployability of ASAP \nstudents by the firms \noffering internships.  \nFrequency of feedback \nfrom the firms: after the \ncompletion of each \ninternship program. \n \n(ii) Third-party validation \nof the evaluation reports \nprepared by the firms \n\nThird-party validation \nagency will be \nengaged by ASAP \nusing loan funds \n \nTerms of reference \nand requirements for \nthird-party validation \n(including selection \ncriteria) will be \ndiscussed between \nASAP and ADB, and \nfinalized by March \n2015   \n\nEvaluation reports of \nfirms offering \ninternships (by July) \n \nASAP\u2019s DLI \nachievement report, \nwhich consolidates the \nfindings and reports to \nADB (by September)   \n \n \n\nDefinition and  \nDescription of Achievement \n\nDisbursement-Linked \nIndicators \nOutcome: Increased employability of ASAP certificate holders  \nPercentage of ASAP trainees certified \nDLI 1: Increase in the \nas employable by firms offering \nemployability rate of ASAP \ninternships  \nmale and female trainees \n \nover the 2016 baseline \nEmployability is defined as ASAP \n \ncertificate holders having skills \nproficiency equivalent to NSQF levels \n3\u20135 (diploma) adequate for entry-\nlevel employment in the respective \nsector.
