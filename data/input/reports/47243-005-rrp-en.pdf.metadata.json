The additional financing is required to scale up the current project by adding \napproximately 930 kilometers (km) of rural roads. \n\n \n\nTo  improve  the  road  network  connecting  the  rural  population to agriculture value  chain \ndevelopment zones, the Rural Connectivity Improvement Project  (i) upgrades about 1,700 km of \nrural roads to all-weather standards with climate resilience and safety features in 34 districts in \nfive  divisions,  (ii)  improves  the  capacity  of  the  rural  infrastructure  agency,  and  (iii)  finances \nenhancements to the national rural road master plan using a geographic information system.1 \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\n \n\nThe project meets the eligibility criteria for additional financing and is performing well.  \n(i) \n\nImplementation  progress  is  satisfactory.  Works  packages  comprise  80%  of \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) financing. To date, bids have been received for \n60 out of the 67 packages (totaling $163 million); of these 48 works contracts have \nbeen signed ($139 million), two packages are pending approval by the ministry ($6 \nmillion), and ten packages are being evaluated. The remaining seven packages \nare at preparation or rebidding stage. Contract awards amount to $115.3 million \n(139% of baseline projections) and disbursements amount to $20.8 million (151% \nof baseline).  \nDelivery  of  expected  outputs  is  rated  successful.  The  Local  Government \nEngineering Division (LGED) is making progress toward achieving the expected \noutputs  by  2023.  For  output  1,  works  have  started  for  37  packages  and  the \nremaining  procurement  is  ongoing.  For  outputs  2  and  3,  the  recruitment  of \nconsultancy firms is ongoing and mobilization is anticipated in the third quarter of \n2020.  The  mobilization  of  the  project  implementation  support  consultant  is \nexpected in June 2020. The project is on track to achieve the project outcome. \nSafeguards  policy  requirements.  All  safeguard covenants  are  being  complied \nwith. \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv)  Management  of  risks  is  rated  successful.  All  risks  detailed  in  the  risk \nassessment and risk management plan are being managed successfully.2 \nProject performance. The project has been rated on track since its effectiveness.  \n\n(v) \n\n \n\nIn  2017,  LGED  in  the  Local  Government  Division  of  the  Ministry  of  Local  Government, \nRural Development and Cooperatives prepared the detailed design of a loan project totaling $300 \nmillion and covering 2,672 km of rural roads in 34 districts.3 The project amount was subsequently \napproved by ADB for $200 million with a reduced scope.4 The additional financing is to scale up \n\n \n\n1  ADB. 2018.

Manila \n(accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n2  Bids for the eight works packages as pilot contracts, including a 5-year maintenance component, have been received. \nThree contracts were awarded in 2019, and the remaining packages are expected to be awarded by 31 May 2020.  \n\n3  ADB. 2016. Project Design Advance for Bangladesh: Rural Infrastructure Maintenance Program. Manila. \n4  ADB Board approved the current project for a regular loan of $100 million (Loan 3731-BAN) and a concessional loan \nof $100 million (Loan 3732-BAN) on 5 November 2018. The loan agreements were signed on 13 January 2019 and \ndeclared effective on 13 February 2019. The current project is to be implemented over 5 years and both loans will \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\nthe first output of the current project from 1,700 km to 2,630 km of rural roads in 16 districts, and \nis  included  in  ADB\u2019s  country  operations  business  plan,  2020\u20132022. 5  The  design  and \nimplementation arrangements for the current project will be used to expedite results, while the  \nimpact  and  outcome  of  the  overall  project  will  be  enhanced  by  covering  additional  geographic \nareas and increasing beneficiaries.6 The overall project scope remains (i) technically feasible and \neconomically  viable;  (ii)  aligned  with  the  government\u2019s  priorities  under  the  Seventh  Five  Year \nPlan,  FY2016\u2013FY2020; 7 (iii)  consistent  with  the  project\u2019s  development  objectives  and  ADB\u2019s \ncountry partnership strategy, 2016\u20132020;8\n and (iv) aligned with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 operational \npriorities  of  (a)  promoting  rural  development  and  food  security,  (b)  tackling  climate  change, \nbuilding  climate  and  disaster  resilience,  and  enhancing  environmental  sustainability;  and  (c) \nstrengthening  governance  and  institutional  capacity. 9  The  coronavirus  disease  (COVID-19) \npandemic has significantly reduced the growth prospects of Bangladesh, and the pandemic will \nultimately  impact the rural  poor  who  are the most  vulnerable and  the  least resilient.  Increased \ngovernment  spending  is  necessary to jump-start  the  economy. Infrastructure  spending  in rural \nroads  improvements  will  generate  local  employment,  increase  access  by  rural  communities  to \nhealth  services  and  medical  supplies,  and  enhance  the  long-term  growth  prospects  of  the \neconomy.  \n\nB. \n\nProject Description \n\n \n\nThe additional financing will increase the current output 1 from 1,700 km to 2,630 km of \nrural roads in 16 districts of the 34 districts covered by the current project, and support LGED to \nproduce  a  design  project  report  for  a  possible  follow-on  loan.  The  impact  and  outcome  of  the \noverall project will remain unchanged from those of the current project.10 \n\nC. \n\nValue Added by ADB  \n\n \n\nThe  Seventh  Five  Year  Plan  aims  to  expand  the  rural  road  capacity  to  increase \nconnectivity, provide greater access to social services and markets, and promote the agriculture \nsector. The government has embarked on a sustained effort to improve the rural road network, \nusing its own resources and with assistance from international development partners. The overall \nproject will provide a foundation for future investments and post-pandemic recovery in rural areas \nin Bangladesh, including a possible follow-on loan, and a possible ADB-financed project (which \nis  in  preparation),  for  which  LGED  will  select  subprojects  that  have  benefited  from  recent \nimprovements  to  the  rural  road  network. 11  ADB\u2019s  value  addition  focuses  on  applying  a \ncomprehensive approach to building climate and disaster resilience, and transferring knowledge \nand  advanced  technologies  and  practices  for  asset  management.  The  project  builds  on  the \nsuccess  of  ADB-supported  rural  road  programs  in  India,  Nepal,  and  Sri  Lanka.  To  enhance \noperational  efficiency  and  reduce  the  ensuing  burden  of  road  maintenance,  the  project  has \nadopted climate-resilient designs, quality control, bioengineering approaches, rigid pavements of \n\n \n\nclose on 31 May 2024. The government kept the original loan amount of $300 million in their Development Project \nProposal approved in 2018, anticipating that ADB would process the additional financing of $100 million in 2019. \n\n5  ADB. 2019.

Its \nbudget  allocation  for  rural  road  maintenance  has  increased  by  an  average  of  16%  per \nyear since 2013. However, it is unlikely that LGED will fully secure the funds required for \nsustainable maintenance, and there is a risk that upgraded roads may not be safely usable \nfor their entire expected economic life. The draft loan agreement includes assurances that \nthe government will provide the required financing to maintain the upgraded roads. \nThe updated financial management assessment indicates that the financial management \nrisk is substantial. The financial management arrangements established under the current \nproject, including the staffing arrangement in the  project management unit and LGED\u2019s \ndistrict  offices,  will  be  followed.  A  financial  management  action  plan  is  in  the  project \nadministration manual.a \nThe procurement of works and recruitment of consultants will be in accordance with the \nADB  Procurement  Policy  (2017,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)  and  the  Procurement \nRegulations for ADB Borrowers (2017, as amended from time to time). The procurement \nclassification is category B. LGED will continue publishing information on their website. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to the government. \nThe  policy  requirements  and  measures  are  described  in  the  project  administration \nmanual. \nThe  current  project  covers  34  districts  with  51.5  million  inhabitants.b  The  additional \nfinancing will cover 16 of these districts, with 40.2 million inhabitants. The major sources \nof income are agricultural produce, trade and business, services, and overseas workers\u2019 \nremittances. The percentage of the population that is poor ranges from 27% in Cumilla to \n57% in Gopalganj, but the economic shocks resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic will \ndeepen  the  poverty  of  those  who  are  already  poor.  The  assessment  consulted  3,114 \npeople,  who  indicated  that  the  additional  financing  project  will  increase  economic  and \nemployment  opportunities,  through  1.73  million  person-days  of  employment  over  the \nconstruction and maintenance periods. \nThe  project  is  categorized  effective  gender  mainstreaming.  The  updated  poverty  and \nsocial analysis included a gender assessment that consulted 753 women. Overall, women \nare supportive of the project as it will provide them with access to economic opportunities \n\nPoverty and \nsocial \n\n14 Social Safeguards Due Diligence Report and Environmental Safeguards Due Diligence Report (accessible from the \n\nlist of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n\fArea of \nAssessment \n\nSafeguards \n\n \nSummary of Assessment \nand  services.  Gender  experts  to  be  hired  as  part  of  the  current  project  will  ensure  the \neffective implementation of the revised gender action plan. \nThe additional financing is classified category B for the environment  in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). The 96 additional rural roads are already in \nexistence, and no bypasses nor land acquisitions are anticipated. They are not located \nwithin  any cultural heritage regions, protected  areas,  buffer zones, or  special areas for \nbiodiversity  protection.  Mitigation  measures  are  integrated  into  the  works  through  an \nenvironmental management plan in the bidding documents. A social and environmental \ngrievance redress mechanism has been established to receive feedback and complaints \nfrom  affected  parties  and  address  these  during  construction  and  operation.  The \ngovernment\u2019s environmental clearance certificate covers the scope of the overall project. \nThe  previously  disclosed  initial  environmental  examination  report  was  updated  and \ndisclosed in March 2020. \nThe  additional  financing  is  classified  category  C  for  involuntary  resettlement,  as  is  the \ncurrent project, in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. The construction \nwill  be  carried  out  mostly  within  existing  road  corridors  and  rights-of-way,  with  minor \nwidening for road safety in some cases, which will require narrow strips of land (less than \n5% of total holdings) to be made available. Similar to the current project, voluntary land \ndonation may be used when land is required. The community participation framework of \nthe current project, which has been disclosed on ADB\u2019s website, will be used. Community \ninstitutional  capacities  and \nparticipation  plans  were  prepared.  Assessment  of \narrangements  confirmed  that  the  agencies  are  capable  to  effectively  implement  the \nframework, community consultations, and monitoring. \nThe additional financing is classified category C for indigenous people in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. It will have not impact the culture, human rights, or \nlivelihood systems of indigenous peoples. \nEnvironmental and social safeguards experts will be engaged as part of the current project \nto continue community consultations, redress grievances, and monitor environmental and \nsocial safeguards during the implementation of the project. \n\nADB = Asian Development Bank, LGED = Local Government Engineering Department. \na  Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \nb  Government of Bangladesh, Bureau of Statistics. 2019.
