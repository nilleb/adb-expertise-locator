The  report  also  describes  proposed \ntechnical  assistance  (TA)  for  Support  for  Project  Implementation  of  the  Nepal  Earthquake \nRehabilitation  and  Reconstruction  Program,  and  if  the  Board  approves  the  proposed  loan,  I, \nacting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, approve the TA. 1 \n \nThe  Earthquake Emergency  Assistance Project  will  support  the Government  of  Nepal  to \n2. \naccelerate recovery and reconstruction following the devastating earthquake of 25 April 2015 and \nthe  major  aftershock  of  12  May  2015.  The  project  will  support  the  rebuilding  of  schools,  roads, \nand district-level government buildings, and strengthen resilience to future disasters. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\n3. \nDisaster risk in Nepal. Nepal is one of the most disaster-prone and vulnerable countries \nin the world. It is the 11th most earthquake-vulnerable country, with major earthquakes occurring \nabout every 80 years.2  \n \n4. \nDescription of the emergency. An earthquake of 7.8 magnitude struck Nepal on 25 April \n2015.  Its  epicenter  was  in  Gorkha  district,  77  kilometer  (km)  northwest  of  Kathmandu,  causing \nwidespread damage. Key characteristics of the disaster are (i) the prolonged period of large-scale \naftershocks; and (ii) catastrophic damages to poorly built buildings and infrastructure in vast and \nrugged  rural  terrain  that  is  difficult  to  access.  The  humanitarian  impact  of  the  earthquake  has \nbeen equally serious, affecting as many as 8 million people. Estimates, as of 3 June 2015, show \n8,702  deaths  and  22,493  injuries.  Preliminary  reports  indicate  that  more  than  785,000  homes \nwere destroyed or damaged. Education of around 1.5 million children has also been affected, as \nthe earthquake destroyed or damaged about 7,000 schools.3   \n \n5. \nThe  government,  international  community,  and  nongovernment  organizations  responded \nquickly to provide immediate rescue and relief. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) approved a \n$3 million grant from the Asia Pacific Disaster Response Fund on 27 April 2015.  \n \n6. \nDamage and loss to property and infrastructure. On 20 May 2015, a joint post-disaster \nneeds  assessment  (PDNA)  was  initiated  by  the  government  in  partnership  with  development \npartners,  including  ADB,  the  European  Union,  Japan  International  Cooperation  Agency,  the \nUnited Nations, and the World Bank. Covering 23 sectors and themes, it assessed damages and \nlosses caused by the earthquakes.4 Preliminary estimates of direct damage total $4.8 billion\u2013$7.7 \nbillion,  equivalent  to  about  22%\u201335%  of  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  of  the  country. 5 The \n\n                                                \n1   The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2   United  Nations  Development  Programme.  2009.  Nepal  Country  Report:  Global  Assessment  of  Risk.  ISDR  Global \n\nAssessment Report on Poverty and Disaster Risk 2009. Kathmandu. \n\n3   Classrooms  are  the  unit  used  by  the  government  to  estimate  damages;  and  30,000  classrooms  is  about  7,000 \n\n4   ADB led the sector assessments for education (co-led with the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund), irrigation, transport, \nand macroeconomic impact (co-led with the World Bank) in collaboration with respective agencies and supported the \npreparation of the cross-cutting disaster risk resilience report.   \n\n5   Post-Disaster  Needs  Assessment  Draft  Executive  Summary  (accessible  from  the  list  of  linked  documents  in \n\nschools.  \n\nAppendix 2).  \n\n \n\n\flargest  component  is  private  housing,  which  amounts  to  $1.2  billion\u2013$3.9  billion,6 followed  by \neducation at $250 million. \n \n7. \nEconomic impacts. According to the Central Bureau of Statistics, annual GDP growth in \nFY2015  will  be  1.6  percentage  points  lower than the  4.6%  estimated  in  the  Asian  Development \nOutlook  2015. 7 The  services  sector  accounted  for  51.0%  of  FY2014  GDP  and  has  been  hit \nhardest, particularly tourism. The main earthquake and prolonged aftershocks caused extensive \ndamage  in  seven  out  of  10  world  heritage  sites  in  Kathmandu  valley  and  severely  affected \npopular  trekking  routes.  The  agriculture  sector  appears  less  affected  in  FY2015,  given  that  the \nharvesting  season  had  passed.  However,  the  impacts  of  lost  livestock  and  productive  assets, \nwhich were severe in affected districts, will prolong recovery. Prior to the earthquakes, Nepal was \nmaintaining  a  sound  fiscal  balance,  with  a  fiscal  deficit  of  only  0.1%  of  GDP  in  FY2014  and  a \nsurplus  of  0.7%  of  GDP  in  FY2013.  Public  debt  has  been  consistently  declining.  A  preliminarily \ndebt  sustainability  analysis  indicates  that  Nepal  may  be  able  to  maintain  its  current  low  debt \ndistress rating. However, close monitoring and concessional support will be needed to cope with \nthe upward pressure. Overall, the economic growth outlook is contingent on the scope and pace \nof reconstruction activities, remittance inflows, the political situation, and monsoon rains. \n \nPoverty impacts. The 14 severely affected districts8 account for about 13.6% of the total \n8. \npopulation living below the poverty line in Nepal. Among them, six have higher poverty rates than \nthe national average of 25.2%,9 and nine have a human development index score lower than the \nnational  average.  Preliminary  estimates  show  that  the  income  shock  resulting  from  the \nearthquake will likely push an additional 700,000 to 982,000 people below the poverty line. The \nincome  shock  is  largely  felt  through  the  loss  of  income-generating  opportunities  and  livelihoods \n(including death and injuries to primary wage earners); and the loss of housing, productive assets \n(seeds, livestock, and farm equipment), and durable assets (assorted household items). Progress \ntoward  the  Sustainable  Development  Goals  is  likely  to  be  adversely  affected  given  the \nwidespread damage to schools, houses, and health posts. 10 \n \n9. \nThe  poor  and  vulnerable  are  particularly  dependent  on  local  infrastructure  for  access  to \nlabor and commodity markets, and for services such as health care and education that strengthen \nhuman  capital,  especially  that  of  children.  Reviving  local  economic  activities  and  resumption  of \nbasic public services, coupled with an accelerated implementation of reconstruction projects, will \nbe critical to make up for the setback on poverty reduction.  Restoring educational services after \nsuch  a  disaster  is  crucial,  since  time  away  from  school  has  long-term  negative  impacts  on \neducation and development. Rebuilding school facilities, planning for a better educational future, \nrestoring connectivity, and promoting resilience are all ways to support faster recovery. \n \nGovernment\u2019s  reconstruction  strategy,  road  map,  and  response.  In  line  with \n10. \npreliminary  PDNA  findings, \nthe  government  has  started  preparing  a  rehabilitation  and \nreconstruction  policy.  The  government  is  also  organizing  a  high-level  donors\u2019  conference  on \n25 June  2015  to  consult  on  the  reconstruction  strategy  and  programs,  including  financing.  The \n\n                                                \n6   The amount varies depending on the valuation method used for rural housing. \n7   ADB. 2015.

The outcome of the conference will be reflected in the FY2016 budget to be finalized \nby 15 July 2015 for immediate initiation of the reconstruction programs.  \n \nDevelopment  partner  coordination.  Before  the  earthquake,  various  development \n11. \npartners  had  been  closely  coordinating  to  build  the  government\u2019s  disaster  risk  management \n(DRM) capacity. In 2009, the Nepal Risk Reduction Consortium was launched by the government \nin  partnership  with  several  development  partners  including  ADB,  to  strengthen  preparedness, \nresponse systems, and the overall policy framework. ADB assisted in pilot retrofitting 160 schools \nin  Kathmandu  valley  (all  of  which  withstood  the  earthquake  of  25  April  2015)  and  preparing  a \nnational  school  safety  master  plan.  After  the  earthquake,  the  government  and  development \npartners  closely  coordinated  rescue,  relief,  and  early  recovery  efforts.  The  PDNA  process  also \ndemonstrated  a  high  level  of  coordination.  The  outcome  of  the  PDNA  provides  a  common \nplatform  to  implement  development  partner-assisted  reconstruction  programs  in  a  harmonized \nand collaborative manner.  \n \nClose  consultations  continue  among  key  development  partners  and  the  government  on \n12. \nthe  assistance  to  be  provided.  The  government  intends  to  apply  aid  coordination  principles  as \nreflected  in  the  Paris  Declaration\u2014reduced  fragmentation,  development  partner  collaboration \npossibly  led  by  a  key  development  partner  in  each  sector,  and  harmonization.  Based  on  these \nprinciples,  focal  areas  for  ADB  assistance  in  the  initial  part  of  the  reconstruction  phase  were \nidentified  as  education  (in  light  of  ADB\u2019s  lead  role  taken  in  school  safety  under  the  Nepal  Risk \nReduction Consortium), road transport, and district towns (in light of the long-term partnership of \nADB in the urban sector). These sectors were also selected in view of the highly significant social \ndevelopment  and  livelihood  restoration  implications.11 Development  partners  were  consulted  on \nthe proposed project design to provide a platform for others to cofinance. \n \n13. \nRequest  for  emergency  assistance  loan.  The  government  requested  an  emergency \nassistance  loan  (EAL)  on  27  May  2015  to  support  its  post-earthquake  recovery  and \nreconstruction.  ADB\u2019s  different  lending  modalities  were  assessed  to  determine  the  most \nappropriate  way  to  help  the  government  respond  to  urgent  needs  while  remaining  within  the \nnational expenditure programs. 12  \n \n14. \nLessons  in  disaster  response.  The  project  incorporates  key  lessons  from  recent \ndisasters in India, Pakistan, and the Philippines. It supports the government to build back better \n(BBB)  and  strengthen  resilience  to  future  disasters,  particularly  through  more  resilient  schools, \nroads and government office buildings and by using school communities to build awareness and \ncapacity \nthrough \nimplementation of the project and capacity building. In view of the finite human resources within \nthe government, the project will require outsourcing of experts to supplement the gaps while not \ndiverting  human  resources  from  ongoing  development  operations.  Building  on  the  existing \npartnership  with  and  capacity  of  the  sector  agencies  is  another  lesson  to  facilitate  timely \nimplementation,  while  using  advanced  procurement  and  retroactive  financing.  To  promote \ntransparency,  reduce  the  administrative  burden,  and  ensure  sound  management,  a  TA  will  be \nprovided  to  set  up  an  electronic,  results-based  monitoring,  and  evaluation  system.  Finally,  to \nidentify  synergies  and  avoid  duplication,  close  development  coordination  was  undertaken  for \nselecting sectors and designing the project. \n\nfor  BBB  will  also  be  strengthened \n\nfor  DRM.  Government  capacity \n\n                                                \n11  In  the  meantime,  the  World  Bank  is  planning  to  focus  on  rural  housing  reconstruction.  The  Japan  International \n\nCooperation Agency has also shown interest in reconstruction and building resilience in major cities.  \n\n12 The project meets all six characteristics of an EAL, as defined in the Staff Instructions.

Manila. \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n15. \nThe  impact  of  the  project  is  accelerated  economic  and  social  recovery  in  Nepal\u2019s \nearthquake affected districts. The outcome will be critical economic and social services resumed \nwith disaster-resilient infrastructure.  \n \nC. \n\nOutputs \n\n16. \n\nIn response to and in line with the PDNA findings, the project has four outputs:13 \n(i) \n\nOutput 1: Schools are rebuilt and upgraded. At least 700 schools will be rebuilt \nor retrofitted in line with school reconstruction plans to disaster-resilient standards \nand  equipped  with  water  and  sanitation  facilities,  including  sex-disaggregated \ntoilets.14 About five will be model schools built with information and communication \ntechnology equipment, science laboratories, and improved learning spaces.  \nOutput  2:  Roads  and  bridges  are  rehabilitated  and/or  reconstructed.  About \n135 km  of  strategic  roads  and  about  450  km  of  rural  roads  damaged  by  the \nearthquake  and  landslides  will  be  rehabilitated.15 Project  roads  and  bridges  will \nhave built back better features for road safety and climate resilience. Construction \nand maintenance equipment will also be procured. \nOutput  3:  District-level  government  facilities  constructed  and/or  rebuilt. \nAbout 300 district-level government buildings will be rebuilt or retrofitted to disaster \nresilient  standards  with  basic  utilities,  and  furnished. 16 Transitional  district-level \ngovernment  offices  will  also  be  established  to  enable  services  to  continue \nthroughout the reconstruction period. \nOutput 4: Disaster preparedness and management capacities strengthened. \nAll  outputs  are  assured  to  be  disaster  risk  resilient.  Engineering  divisions  of  all \nimplementing agencies will be strengthened.  \n \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nD. \n\nInvestment and Financing Plans \n\n17. \nInvestment  plan.  The  project  is  estimated  to  cost  $232  million  (Table  1).  Detailed  cost \nestimates  by  expenditure  category  and  detailed  cost  estimates  by  financier  are  provided  in  the \nproject administration manual (PAM).17 \n \n18. \nFinancing plan. The government has requested a loan in various currencies equivalent to \nSDR143,212,000 from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources to help finance the project. The loan will \nhave  an  interest  charge  at  the  rate  of  1.0%  per  annum;  a  term  of  40  years,  including  a  grace \nperiod of 10 years; repayment of principal at 2% per annum for the first 10 years after the grace \nperiod  and 4%  per annum thereafter,  and  such other  terms  and  conditions set forth in the draft \nloan  agreement.  The  loan  from  ADB  will  finance  (i)  civil  works  and  equipment,  (ii) consulting \nservices and capacity building, (iii) financing charges during construction on ADB\u2019s loan, and (iv) \n\n                                                \n13  Subproject Selection Criteria and Approval Procedures (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n14  The  total  number  of  classrooms  to  be  rebuilt  or  retrofitted  is  at  least  7,000,  or  almost  one-fourth  of  the \n\n30,000 damaged classrooms, benefiting at least 350,000 children. \n\n15  PDNA  preliminary  estimates  are  damages  to  4,400  km  of  roads  in  rural  areas,  requiring  $250  million  for \n\nreconstruction. Their reconstruction is critical to restore the livelihoods of the affected population.    \n\n16  This responds to the urgent need for restoration of public service delivery in district headquarters. PDNA preliminary \n\nestimates are $250 million in damages to government buildings.   \n\n17 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n\fnominal  taxes  and  duties  on  ADB-financed  project  expenditure.18 The  government  will  provide \n$32  million  equivalent  to  cover  (i)  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  costs,  (ii)  incremental \nadministration costs, and (iii) all other taxes and duties.

Some development partners have expressed their interest to participate in \nthe  proposed  project,  including  through  cofinancing.    Considering  that  the  damages  and  losses \nare substantial, additional funds from cofinanciers could be utilized to expand the coverage of the \nproject  components.  ADB  typically  seeks  Board  approval  for  the  administration  of  loan  or  grant \nfunds  from  cofinanciers  only  when  cofinancing  commitments  are  in  place.  Discussions  are \nunderway,  but  no  firm  commitment  has  been  made  at  this  short  notice.  In  light  of  the  need  for \nexpediency  and  efficiency  in  the  response  to  post-disaster  recovery  and  rehabilitation, \nManagement  requests  Board  approval  for  the  administration  of  any  cofinanced  funds  obtained \nfrom  development  partners  subsequent  to  the  date  of  Board  approval,  consistent  with  the \nobjective,  purpose  or  scope  of  the  project.  The  administration  of  such  cofinanced  funds  will  be \napproved  by  Management  and  reported  to  the  Board  in  accordance  with  standard  reporting \nprocedures. \n  \n\n                                                \n18 ADB financing includes part of tax and duties of about $5 million. The estimated expenditure is not excessive (2.5% \nof  ADB  financing  amount)  and  will  apply  only  to  ADB-financed  expenditures.  The  amount  is  within  a  reasonable \nthreshold identified during the country partnership strategy preparation process. Financing of the taxes and duties is \nmaterial  and  relevant  to  the  success  of  the  project  and  to  simplify  and  expedite  disbursement  arrangements.  Any \nincidental expenditures relating to bank charges, local transport, freight, and insurance are eligible for ADB financing. \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\nE. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n20. \nAn interministerial  project steering  committee,  chaired  by  the secretary  of  the  Ministry  of \nFinance,  will  guide  project  implementation  and review  progress  and results. It  will  meet  at  least \ntwice  a  year.  The  government  is  establishing  a  special  purpose  vehicle  (SPV)  to  manage  the \nreconstruction  programs  with high efficiency  through focused,  streamlined,  and flexible decision \nmaking in budgetary, implementation, and monitoring and evaluation processes. The SPV will be \nthe  executing  agency  for  the  project  once  established,  and  the  Ministry  of  Finance  will  be  the \ninterim executing agency. The project management unit will be established within the SPV. \n \n21. \n\nThe implementing agencies are: \n(i) \n\nThe  Department  of  Education  of  the  Ministry  of  Education  for  schools  (outputs  1 \nand  4), 19  supported  by  the  Department  of  Urban  Development  and  Building \nConstruction of the Ministry of Urban Development.  \nThe  Department  of  Local  Infrastructure  Development  of  the  Ministry  of  Federal \nAffairs  and  Local  Development  and  the  Department  of  Roads  of  the  Ministry  of \nPhysical  Infrastructure  Transport  for  rural  roads  and  strategic  roads,  respectively \n(outputs 2 and 4).  \nThe  Department  of  Urban Development  and  Building  Construction  of the  Ministry \nof Urban Development for district headquarters buildings (outputs 3 and 4).  \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n \n22. \nA  project  implementation  unit  will  be  established  in  each  implementing  agency.  At  the \ndistrict  level,  each  implementing  agency  will  have  district  implementation  units to supervise and \nimplement the approved subproject activities.  \n \n23. \n(footnote 17). \n \n\nThe  implementation  arrangements  are  summarized  in  Table  3  and  detailed  in  the  PAM \n\nAspects  \nImplementation period \n\nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \n\nArrangements \n\nSeptember 2015\u2013September 2018 \nThe project will be implemented over 3 years. The extended \nimplementation period beyond the EAL norm of 2 years is justified \ngiven the extensive nature of the disaster, low capacity, the need for \nbuilding back better, and Nepal\u2019s historically low disbursement record. \n30 September 2018/31 March 2019 \n\nEstimated completion date/loan \nclosing date \nManagement \n\n(i)   Oversight body \n\nProject steering committee comprised of the secretary, Ministry of \nFinance (chair);a secretary, Ministry of Urban Development; secretary, \nMinistry of Education; secretary, Ministry of Federal Affairs and Local \nDevelopment; secretary, Ministry of Physical Infrastructure and \nTransport; representative, National Planning Commission; and project \ndirectors (four implementing agencies) \nMinistry of Finance (for interim period) \nDepartment of Education, Department of Local Infrastructure \nDevelopment, Department of Roads, Department of Urban \nDevelopment and Building Construction \nFour implementing agencies; about 40 full-time staff proposed \nICB \nNCB \n\n2 contracts \nNumerous contracts \n\n$15.0 million \n$157.5 million \n\n                                                \n19 Output 4 includes consultancies to support all four implementing agencies; and outputs 1 to 3.  \n\n(ii)   Executing agency \n(iii)  Key implementing \n\nagencies \n\n(iv)  Implementation unit \n\nProcurement \n\n \n\n\fAspects  \n \nConsulting services \n\nRetroactive financing and/or \nadvance contracting \n\nDisbursement  \n\nArrangements \n\n$6.5 million \n$6.3 million \n$2.2 million \n$0.3 million \n\nNumerous contracts \n1,683 person-months \n930 person-months \n90 person-months \n\nShopping \nQCBS \nICS \nCQS \nFor eligible expenditures incurred for consulting services; procurement \nof goods, services, and civil works; and project administration after 25 \nApril 2015, and up to a maximum of 30% of the loan amount. \nThe loan proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan \nDisbursement Handbook (2015, as amended from time to time) and \ndetailed arrangements agreed upon between the government and \nADB. \n\nADB  =  Asian  Development  Bank,  CQS=consultants\u2019  qualification  selection,  EAL  =  emergency  assistance  loan, \nICB = international  competitive  bidding,  ICS  =  individual  consultant  selection,  NCB  =  national  competitive  bidding, \nQCBS = quality- and cost-based selection,  \na  The  special  purpose  vehicle  chief  executive  officer  will  chair  the  committee  once  the  special  purpose  vehicle  is \n\nestablished. \n\nSources: Asian Development Bank; Government of Nepal. \n \n24. \nProcurement.  The  procurement  of  goods  and  works,  and  recruitment  of  consulting \nservices, will be carried out in a manner consistent with the simplified and expedient procedures \npermitted  under  ADB\u2019s  Disaster  Emergency  Assistance  Policy  (2004),  Procurement  Guidelines \n(2015,  as  amended  from  time  to  time),  and  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2013,  as \namended from time to time).  \n \n25. \nBased  on  the  procurement  capacity  assessments  of  the  executing  agency  (interim)  and \nimplementing  agencies,  (i)  centralized  procurement  will  be  used;  and  (ii)  thresholds  for  the \nprocurement  of  works,  goods,  and  consulting  services  have  been  agreed  with  the  government. \nADB\u2019s  prior  review  and  post  review  have  been  set  forth  in  the  procurement  plan.  Domestic \npreference will be provided to the international competitive bidding contracts for goods and works \nin  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines.  The  PAM\u2019s  procurement  section  details  the \nthresholds and processes to be followed. \n \n\nIII. \n\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n\n26. \nTo  support  the  new  SPV  (under  establishment)  and  the  implementing  agencies  in \nimplementing the project on time and efficiently and to build their capacities, the government has \nrequested ADB to provide TA grant support for earthquake reconstruction. The TA will have three \noutputs: (i) institutional capacity strengthened, (ii) effective monitoring and evaluation established, \nand  (iii) school  safety  enhanced.  The  first  output  will  provide  capacity  building  support  to  the \nexecuting agency and implementing agencies for speedy and smooth implementation, particularly \nwith  respect  to  procurement,  contract  management,  quality  control,  and  disbursement.  The \nsecond output will help establish monitoring and evaluation systems at central and district levels. \nThe  third  output  will  help  establish  design  standards,  type  designs,  disaster  awareness \ncurriculums,  and  training  systems  for  masons.20 The  TA  is  estimated  to  cost  $1,500,000  which \nwill be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-V).21 \n \n\n                                                \n20  The  TA  will  provide  international  consultants  to  bring  international  best  practices  on  school  safety  design  and  to \n\nprovide quality assurance. This complements related activities in the loan.  \n\n21 Capacity  development  will  also  be  supported  by  ongoing  TA  for  Enhancing  Portfolio  Performance,  which  provides \ntraining  on  a  range  of  project  implementation  subjects  by  setting  up  the  Capacity  Development  Resource  Center \nbased on a capacity rating system and training calendars. ADB. 2014. Technical Assistance for Enhancing Portfolio \nPerformance: Technical Assistance Report. Manila.  \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\nA. \n\nTechnical \n\nIV. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\n27. \nThe final selection of subprojects is not complete but will be in accordance with the criteria \nand  approval  procedures  already  agreed  with  the  government.  These  include  adherence  to \nsafeguards requirements and technical viability. Implementing agencies will lead the screening of \npriority projects. The objective is to rebuild to a better standard. Climate risk screening, including \nnatural  hazards  caused  by  climate  events,  was  conducted.  Results  will  be  considered  in  the \ntechnical design of schools, roads, and bridges as appropriate. Consultants under ongoing roads \nprojects will be used to prepare designs.  \n \nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial  \n\n28. \nGiven  the  focus  on  severely  affected  zones,  the  project  is  likely  to  bring  significant \nincremental  benefits  economy-wide  and to the  affected  population.  Financial  and economic  due \ndiligence  will  be  conducted  after  Board  approval  and  once  the  individual  projects  have  been \nidentified  due  to  the  difficulty  in  acquiring  information  in  the  short  processing  time  needed  for \nemergency response. All of the identified subprojects will be subject to economic analysis as per \nADB guidelines to ensure that the selected projects are economically viable. \n \nOverall, the multiplier effect of large-scale, productivity-enhancing capital investments will \n29. \nbe much larger in the post-quake rehabilitation and reconstruction phase given that the aggregate \ndemand is  suppressed and private  sector  investment  has  slowed  down.  Furthermore,  proposed \ncapital  investments  through  the  project  will  increase  returns  to  private  investment  over  time, \nincrease  per  capita  income,  create  local  jobs,  and  boost  local  as  well  as  regional  economic \nactivities.  \n \n30. \nProject  outputs  are  public  service  goods  with  no  cost  recovery,  and  hence  no  financial \nviability assessment is required. Roads, schools, and buildings constructed under the project will \nbe  maintained  from  relevant  ministries\u2019  ongoing  recurrent  budget.  Government  commitment  will \nbe  obtained  as  a  loan  assurance.  As  project  outputs  are  built  back  with  features  to  enhance \nresilience, there would be less strain on the operations and maintenance budget.  \n\nC. \n\nGovernance  \n\n31. \nAn  updated  financial  management  assessment  of  the  executing  and  implementing \nagencies  was  conducted  for  the  purposes  of  the  emergency  project.  The  overall  fiduciary  risk, \nalthough substantial, remains manageable as a result of the additional measures provided in the \nPAM,  notably  the  targeted  TA  and  support  to  the  executing  agency.  All  four  implementing \nagencies have satisfactory experience in implementing ADB-funded projects. A key risk mitigating \nmeasure  is  to  ensure  a  dedicated  full-time  qualified  accountant  forms  part  of  the  project \nmanagement unit and program implementation units.   \n \n32. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government,  Ministry  of  Finance,  and  all  implementing  agencies.  The  specific  policy \nrequirements and supplementary measures are described in the PAM (footnote 17). \n\nD. \n\n \nPoverty and Social \n\n33. \nThe  project  is  expected  to  help  restore  classes  in  permanent,  safe  buildings  for  at  least \n350,000 students in project communities, and citizen services in at least 10 of the most affected \ndistricts. Beneficiaries include households headed by females and those below the poverty line. \n\n \n\n\fThe  project  will  help  restore  and  improve  (i)  school  facilities,  in  consultation  with  affected \ncommunities;  (ii)  access  to  public  and  social  service  facilities;  and  (iii)  connectivity  toward  the \nrecovery  of  business,  livelihoods,  and  commercial  activities.  It  will  also  act  on  social  risks \nassociated with disasters, such as sexually transmitted infections, human trafficking (child, girls, \nwomen trafficking), and child labor. \n \n34. \nGender. The  project  is classified  effective gender mainstreaming,  and  a gender  equality \nand  social  inclusion  (GESI)  action  plan  has  been  prepared.  22  To  ensure  the  effective \nimplementation  of  the  GESI  Action  Plan,  the  project  will  hire  four  GESI  experts\u2014one  based  in \nKathmandu  and  three  in  the  affected  districts. These  GESI  experts  will  ensure that  women and \ndisadvantaged  groups  are  part  of  the  rehabilitation  and  recovery  processes,  including  labor \nopportunities, and will receive equitable pay for work of equal value. GESI-related results will be \nreported using sex-, caste-, and ethnicity-disaggregated data.  \n\nE. \n\n \nSafeguards \n\nEnvironment.  The  project  is classified  category B for  environment.  Subproject  selection \n35. \ncriteria  were  formulated  to  avoid  significant  adverse  environmental  impacts.  An  environmental \nassessment  and  review  framework  (EARF)  has  been  prepared  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009)  and government  laws  and  regulations.  The  draft  EARF  has \nbeen  disclosed  on  ADB\u2019s  website.  Implementation  arrangements  build  on  the  implementing \nagencies\u2019  experience  from  other  ADB-financed  projects,  and  adequate  capacity  is  ensured  to \nmanage  environmental  impacts  through  consultant  support.  Initial  environmental  examinations \nand  environmental  management  plans  will  be  prepared  consistent  with  the  EARF,  and  will  be \nincorporated  in  bidding  documents  and  contract  documents  to  be  implemented  by  contractors \nand  monitored  by  the  implementing  agencies.  Environmental  reporting  to  the  Nepal  Resident \nMission will be done on a semiannual basis. \n \nSocial. The project is classified category B for involuntary resettlement and category C for \n36. \nindigenous  peoples.  Subproject  selection  criteria  were  formulated  to  avoid  land  acquisition, \ninvoluntary resettlement impacts, and social risks. A resettlement framework has been prepared \nand  disclosed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),  and  government \nlaws and regulations, to guide planning studies and detailed designs of subprojects. The project \nensures  that  the  implementing  agencies  have  adequate  capacity  to  prepare  resettlement  plans \nthrough  consultant  support.  Consultations  will  be  undertaken  with  stakeholders  in  project  areas \nduring  implementation.  Resettlement  implementation  reporting  to  the  resident  mission  will  be \ndone on a semiannual basis. \n  \nF. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures   \n\nThe  overall  risk  is  medium  while  the  integrated  benefits  and  impacts  are  expected  to \n37. \noutweigh  the  costs.  The  main  risks  relate  to  the  ongoing  political  impasse  and  capacity  issues. \nMajor risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail in the risk \nassessment and risk management plan.23  \n \n\nRisks \nProlonged political \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nMitigating Measures \n\nDevelopment partners continue dialogue with the government and key \n\n                                                \n22  Gender  Action  Plan:  Gender  Equality  and  Social  Inclusion  Plan  (accessible  from  the  list  of  linked  documents  in \n\nAppendix 2). \n\n23 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\nRisks \ntransition \n\nPoor financial \nmanagement \ncompliance \n\nLow implementing \ncapacity \n(government) \nLow implementing \ncapacity (contractors) \n\nMitigating Measures \n\nstakeholders to ensure that the rehabilitation and reconstruction program can \nmove forward in light of the ongoing political processes. Establishment of a \nseparate special purpose vehicle with financial and approval powers for \nexecution of the rehabilitation and reconstruction program will further mitigate \nthe risk of slow implementation.  \nThe executing agency will set up a unified web-based project monitoring and \nmanagement information system in the PMU, PIUs, and district counterparts to \nmonitor implementation, fund flows, accounting, audit and reporting functions. \nDedicated accounting staff shall be part of the PMU. \nExtensive support from ADB consultants will be provided for procurement, \nfinancial management, disbursement, monitoring and safeguard policies, and \nprocedures. Ongoing technical assistance will also be used to this end. \nContractors will be trained in the preparation and submission of responsive bids, \nand compliance with contractual conditions. The design, construction, and \nsupervision consultant will be engaged for close monitoring and support on \ncontractual compliance. To ensure contractors\u2019 cash flow, an advance of 20% \nwill be provided against a reputable bank guarantee.  \n\ncommunity to ensure utilization and maintenance. Under the existing sector \npartnerships with ADB, line ministries have plans to pursue O&M sustainability \n(through sound asset inventories, performance monitoring, O&M planning, and \nbudget allocation for execution).
