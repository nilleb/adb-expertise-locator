The  technical  capacity \nlimitations  and  the  delay  associated  with  such  satellite-based  connectivity  severely  limit  the \nquality  of  internet  service.4 The  high  cost  and  limited  international  bandwidth  restrict  internet \npenetration.5 In  Palau,  internet  is  accessed  by  only  25%  of  the  population,  while  90%  have \naccess to mobile phones.  \n \n4. \nThe ICT sector is widely recognized as an enabler of economic growth, social stability, \nand  development.  Increased  access  to  ICT,  particularly  broadband  internet  services,  helps \ndeliver  improved  financial  services  and  social  services,  such  as  health  and  education,  among \nothers.6 It  brings  efficiency  and  reduces  the  cost  of  such  services,  and  in  turn  enables  an \nenvironment  conducive  to  private  sector  investment.  The  ICT  sector  has  created  significant \nemployment opportunities in many Asian countries. High-speed international communication is \nimportant  to  the  tourism  industry  (on  which  Palau  is  highly  reliant)  for  marketing,  facilitating \nbookings and contributing to tourist satisfaction.7  \n \nIn  2014,  Palau  and  the  Federated  States  of  Micronesia  (FSM)  jointly  initiated  a \n5. \nsubmarine  internet  cable  project  and  set  up  a  joint  committee,  MicroPal, 8  to  examine \nconnectivity  options  through  submarine  cable  by  recognizing  the  similar  nature  of  their  needs \n\n                                                \n1   The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2   SEA\u2013US  is  a  consortium  of  seven  private  telecom  operators  created  in  April  2015  to  build  a  $250  million  fiber \noptic cable from Indonesia to the west coast of the United States via Guam, Hawaii and the Philippines.  The West \nSubsystem parties are Globe (the Philippines) and Telin (Indonesia). \n\n3   ADB. 2013. Technical Assistance for the Pacific Information and Communication Technology Investment Planning \n\nand Capacity Development Facility. Manila. \n\n4   The latency of the satellite service is about 500 milliseconds compared with 80 milliseconds for cable. \n5   Palau  has  a  capacity  of  220  megabits  per  second.  Satellite  connectivity  is  generally  available  at  a  cost  of \n\n$1,500/megabit/second/month compared with submarine cable at $600/megabit/second/month. \n\n6     World  Bank.  2009.  Information  and  Communications  for  Development  2009:  Extending  Reach  and  Increasing \n\nImpact. Washington, DC. \n\n7   Palau  has  a  population  of  about  20,000  and  a  tourism  industry  of  over  120,000  visitors  annually.  Tourism  is \nequivalent  to  over  50%  of  gross  domestic  product,  and  services  represent  87%.  Economic  growth  has  been \nstrong, averaging above 3% annually since 2010, thanks to record visitor arrivals and construction. \n\n8   MicroPal has six members\u2014three representatives from each country\u2014appointed by the President of the Republic \nof Palau and the Government of FSM. MicroPal has been supported by World Bank-funded consultants. It meets \nevery quarter (and more often as required) to discuss project implementation progress and other issues. \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nand  the  benefits  of  cooperation. 9  MicroPal  initially  explored  building  an  independent  cable \nconnecting to Guam through a single procurement package. The Palau portion of the project is \nto be financed by ADB and the Yap state of FSM portion by the World Bank. The World Bank \napproved  a  grant  of  $47.5  million  to  the  FSM  in  December  2014  that  includes  supporting  the \nYap cable.10  \n   \n6. \nIn 2015, the construction of SEA\u2013US cable provided an opportunity for Palau and Yap to \nconnect  to  Guam  through  spurs  and  branching  units.  Palau  and  Yap  will  each  own  their \nrespective spurs and will have indefeasible right of use (IRU) on the SEA\u2013US cable. This option \nis  found  to  be  the  most  cost-effective  solution,  requiring  significantly  lower  capital  expenditure \nand  lower  operational  costs.  Moreover,  the  SEA\u2013US  option  gives  the  newly  established  cable \ncompany in Palau (Belau Submarine Cable Corporation [BSCC]) and the FSM cable company \nthe opportunity to leverage experience from the members of the SEA\u2013US consortium (footnote \n2)  to  maintain  and  operate  a  submarine  cable\u2014thereby  reducing  the  technical  risk  to  both \ncountries.  \n \nMicroPal,  on  behalf  of  BSCC  and  the  FSM  cable  company,  is  at  the  final  stage  of \n7. \nnegotiating  a  memorandum  of  understanding  with  the  SEA\u2013US  parties.  Subsequently,  BSCC \nand  the  FSM  cable  company  will  enter  into  agreements  with  SEA\u2013US  that  will  set  out  a  clear \ndemarcation  of  responsibilities  for  Palau  and  the  FSM,  with  no  cross-linkages  such  as  cross-\neffectiveness, cross-default, and cross-termination between the rights and obligations of Palau \non the one part and FSM on the other part. Under this structure, ADB and World Bank funds will \nnot be financing a single procurement package.  \n \nThe proposed project will provide higher quality broadband internet at a much lower cost \n8. \nto  Palau,  making  it  accessible  and  affordable  for  the  broader  population.  The  passing  on  of \nreduced  costs  by  the  wholesaler  (BSCC)  and  retailers  will  be  ensured  through  the  effective \noperation of the telecoms sector regulator.11 The cable, with a capacity of 2 terabits per second, \nwill  more  than  meet  the  broadband  capacity  needs  of  Palau  at  least  until  2040  (the  expected \ncable  life  is  as  long  as  50  years).  The  uptake  of  internet  will  be  a  reflection  of  the  project\u2019s \nsuccess.  The  Palau  country  operations  business  plan  (COBP)  includes  TA  in  2017  to  build \ncapacity  and  demonstrate  efficient  public  service  provision  through  use  of  the  internet. 12 \nElsewhere in the Pacific, ADB is supporting e-health and e-education initiatives that will inform \nthe  design  of  the  application  in  Palau. 13 The  project  will  also  improve  the  operation  of  the \nsecured  transactions  system  (improving  access  to  finance),  as  well  as  online  business \nregistration, both of which are supported by ADB\u2019s Private Sector Development Initiative.14  \n \n9. \n\nThe  proposed  project  is  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  Interim  Pacific  Approach  2015,  which \n\n                                                \n9   As  an  interim  solution,  Palau  and  the  FSM  telecom  providers  separately  contracted  a  5-year,  150-megabit-per-\nsecond service from a medium earth orbit satellite broadband service at the end of 2014. Once the more reliable \nsubmarine cable system is operational, the satellite system will complement this by providing back up in case of \nan interruption.  \n\n10   World  Bank.  2014.

It  will  be  achieved  through \n(i) the construction of the approximately 300-kilometer spur and a branching unit to connect to \nthe SEA\u2013US submarine cable, (ii) efficient and effective operation of BSCC by the government, \nand (iii) agreements for IRU and maintenance between BSCC and SEA\u2013US parties. The project \nwill be supported by a project management unit (PMU)  initially resourced by a team of project \nimplementation consultants. \n \nD. \n \n12. \n \n13. \nThe government has requested a loan from  ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources (OCR) in \nthe amount of $16,470,000 and a loan in various currencies equivalent to SDR6,032,000  from \nADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources.  Palau  will  contribute  $5.19  million  in  kind,  bearing  taxes  and \nthe cost of operating BSCC during the project construction period. \n \n14. \nThe  OCR  loan will  have  a  25-year term,  including a grace  period  of  5  years,  using the \nstraight-line  repayment  method  with  an  annual  interest  rate  determined  in  accordance  with \nADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility, and a commitment charge \nof  0.15%  per  year.  Based  on  this,  the  average  loan  maturity  is  15.25  years  and  the  maturity \npremium payable to ADB is 0.1% per annum. The ADF loan will have a 25-year term, including \na grace period of 5 years and interest of 2% per annum during the grace period and thereafter. \nOther terms and conditions are set forth in the draft loan and project agreements. The interest \nfor both loans and the commitment charge for the OCR loan during project implementation will \nbe capitalized. \n \n15. \nloans.19 BSCC will enter into a project agreement with ADB.

ADB  activities  included \neconomic,  financial,  social,  and  safeguards  assessments  undertaken  through  regional  TA  and \nstaff consultant inputs (footnote 3). \n \nA. \n\nTechnical \n\n20. \nThe  project  will  connect  Palau  through  a  spur  and  branching  unit  to  the  international \nsubmarine cable  owned by  the  SEA\u2013US  connecting  to  Guam.  Palau  will  own  its  spur  and will \n\n \n\n\ftechnology.  The  cable  will  be                     \n\n6 \n\n \n\nSubmarine cable is the preferred, most cost-effective, and most sustainable method for \n\nhave an IRU on the SEA\u2013US cable. Palau will leverage the SEA\u2013US landing station and permit \nin Guam.  \n \n21. \ninternet  connectivity,  with  well-established  and  proven \n4.0\u20137.5 centimeters  in  diameter,  with  no  significant  impact  on  the  ocean  environment.  The \ngovernment  will  establish  the  cable  path  in  the  ocean  as  a  \u201cno  anchor  zone\u201d  to  avoid  any \ndamage to the cable. The cable will land in Meyuns hamlet on Arakabesang Island in Koror, a \ngovernment-owned landing site used by the Palau National Communications Corporation, which \nalready  has  a  conduit  for  placement  of  the  cable  leading  directly  to  the  existing  landing  site. \nBSCC  will  sign  an  agreement  with  Palau  National  Communications  Corporation,  the  state-\nowned  telecom  supplier,  to  use  the  land  and  facility  for  the  landing  and  for  connection  to  the \nexisting national terrestrial network and a 128-kilometer interisland, fiber-optic cable.  \n \n22. \nBSCC will act as a wholesale supplier of internet in Palau, and will obtain the necessary \noperating  permit  and  license.  BSCC  will  buy  the  capacity  from  the  service  providers  in  Guam \nand  sell  it  to  all  local  telecom  providers  in  an  equitable  and  nondiscriminatory  way,  following \nPalau\u2019s telecom regulatory policy. The local telecom providers will be responsible for providing a \nretail internet service using their own infrastructure.  \n \nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n23. \nFinancial.  In  assessing  the  financial  viability  of  the  project,  demand  is  forecast \nconservatively  below  the  region\u2019s  average  adoption  rates,  at  an  annual  growth  rate  of  about \n40.0%, declining to 20.0% within the first 5 years after the cable comes into service, then falling \nsteadily  to  about  3.5%  growth  by  2021,  which  is  expected  to  be  sustained  thereafter.  The \naverage annual growth rate over 15 years will be 12.0%. The resulting capacity is positioned at \nthe lower end of all available Pacific-based benchmark data. BSCC will generate revenues from \nthe  wholesaling  of  broadband  internet  capacity.  The  financial  viability  of  the  project  was \nevaluated by estimating the cash flows from operations and calculating the financial internal rate \nof return (FIRR). The cost of the project was estimated based on constant US dollar prices as of \nSeptember  2015.  For  the  financial  evaluation,  contingencies  and  financing  charges  were \nexcluded. \n \n24. \nThe  FIRR  was  estimated  at  11.7%  against  the  weighted  average  cost  of  capital  of \n2.38%. The interest rate of domestic borrowing has been used to assign an assumed cost to the \ngrant from the World Bank, while the proceeds of the ADB loans will be onlent to BSCC on the \nsame terms and conditions as the ADB loan. The cash flows were most sensitive to subscription \nlevels. Prices, initially set at $863/megabit/second/month, are forecast to fall as efficiencies and \neconomies  of  scale  are  achieved.  An  increasing  subscriber  base  is  projected  based  on  local \ndemand and tourist arrivals. The FIRR after tax compares favorably with the weighted average \ncost  of  capital,  showing  the  financial  viability  of  the  project.  It  remains  robust  against  a  10% \nincrease  in  investment  costs,  a  10%  increase  in  operating  costs,  or  a  20%  decrease  in \nrevenues.   \n \n \n25. \nEconomic.    The  capital  cost  assumed  for  the  economic  analysis  was  $25.19  million \nincluding  physical  contingencies.  The  projected  costs  and  benefits  are  converted  to  economic \n\n\f7 \n \n\nvalues by applying a standard conversion factor of 0.9 and a shadow wage rate factor of 0.8.22 \nThe  analysis  used  constant  2015  prices  and  the  world  price  numeraire.  Costs  include  some \nminor  incremental  operating  and  capital  costs  incurred  by the retail  service providers  (BSCC\u2019s \nwholesale customers) to expand and upgrade their capacity to meet increased demand.  \n  \n26. \nThe project benefits are assumed proportional to traffic volume. With all existing internet \nusers  reasonably  expected  to  migrate  to  faster  and  more  reliable  connections,  broadband \nservices  represent  a  new  market  segment,  with  benefits  corresponding  to  willingness  to  pay. \nThis  is  calculated  as  the  sum  of  consumer  surplus,  and  internet  retail  revenue.  Annual \nconsumer surplus is projected at about 0.8% of gross domestic product.23 Annual internet retail \nrevenue  is  computed  by  multiplying the  average  revenue  per  user  by  the projected  number of \nsubscribers.  The  average  revenue  per  user  is  estimated  at  7%  of  gross  domestic  product  per \ncapita (i.e., $70 per month in 2016).24 \n \n27. \nThe project\u2019s economic internal rate of return under the base case scenario is estimated \nat  18.8%,  well  above  the  ADB  social  discount  rate  of  12%  per  annum.  Sensitivity  analysis \nconfirms that economic viability is maintained even with a 20% reduction in projected revenues, \na 10% increase in capital expenditure, or a 10% increase in operating expenditures. \n\n \nGovernance \n\nC. \n\nframework \n\nProcurement  capacity.  The  World  Bank  has  funded  MicroPal \n\nFinancial  management.  Palau  has  a  robust  budget  allocation \n\n28. \nfor \ngovernment  policies  and  priorities. 25  The  Palau  public  auditor  contracts  out  audits  to  an \ninternationally affiliated certified professional audit firm and audits are conducted in accordance \nwith the requirements of the Single Audit Act, 1996. BSCC is a newly established state-owned \nenterprise  with  no  permanent  staff,  so  the  financial  management  risk  is  assessed  as  high. \nDuring implementation, BSCC will be supported by the PMU, with an experienced finance and \naccounting specialist to manage its accounting and reporting within six months from the project \neffective  date.  A  comprehensive  time-bound  action  plan  has  been  developed  in  the  PAM  to \nmitigate the risk.  \n \n29. \nto  engage  an \nexperienced team of project coordinators to explore available design options and to prepare for \nimplementation  of  the  most  cost-effective  solution.  The  proposed  SEA\u2013US  submarine  cable \nprovides the best option for Palau and Yap to connect to Guam. Palau and the FSM decided to \nengage  SEA\u2013US  parties  to  procure  and  operate  their  respective  cable  systems.  This \narrangement simplifies the procurement process for the cable system in Palau and BSCC. The \nproject  coordinators  have  worked  with  ADB,  and  are  fully  aware  of  ADB\u2019s  direct  contracting \nprocurement guidelines and requirements. For landing station construction, ADB will review the \nprocurement  process  and  approve  the  selection  of  suppliers.  BSCC  will  recruit  a  PMU \nconsultant to manage the contracts during implementation.  \n \n30. \n\nAnticorruption.

The World Bank-funded TA aims to \nstrengthen  the  legal  and  regulatory  framework  for  ICT  and  address  critical  issues  like \ninterconnection  between  mobile  operators.  The  ICT  regulatory  office  is  expected  to  be  set  up \nprior to the submarine cable system coming online. Strong and robust regulation is essential to \nensure that BSCC does not engage in monopoly pricing or other anticompetitive behavior, and \nthat  internet  retailers  do  not  abuse  their  market  position.  ADB  will  monitor  implementation \nclosely,  and  TA  support  (footnote  3)  will  be  provided  if  needed.  The  figure  depicts  the  future \noperational structure of telecom players.  \n \n\n \n\nD. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\nPalau has achieved most of the Millennium Development Goals.26 Palauans enjoy free, \n32. \nor  heavily  subsidized,  and  relatively  high  standards  of  health  services,  education,  and  other \npublic  utilities.  Building  on  this  solid  base  of  quality  public  services,  the  project  will  provide \nreliable,  faster,  and  affordable  internet  to  the  population.  It  will  facilitate  more  young  people \npursuing higher or more relevant labor market qualifications via the internet, reducing the need \nto go overseas to study. In addition, it will improve opportunities for rural and urban households \nto easily  connect  to families overseas,  and increase  e-marketing  opportunities for  businesses, \nas well as enable improved delivery of key government services to the local population through \ne-education, e-health, and e-governance actions. With faster internet at a lower cost, business \nefficiencies and cost reductions will create additional employment opportunities, particularly for \nlower skilled labor. \n \n33. \nThe  project  is  classified  as  having  no  gender  elements.

The  project  has  been  classified \ncategory  C  for  involuntary  resettlement  and  indigenous  peoples.  Due  diligence  has  confirmed \nthat  the  project  does  not  require  land  acquisition  and  resettlement,  and  does  not  impact  any \ndistinct and/or vulnerable group of indigenous peoples. The cable landing site is on government-\nowned land, and existing networks or rights-of-way will be utilized for the cable extension. The \nproject beneficiaries are part of the mainstream Palauan people.  \n \nEnvironment.  The  project  is  classified  category  B  for  environment.    An  initial \n35. \nenvironmental  examination  (including  environmental  management  plan)  and  an  environmental \ncode of practice  have  been prepared  to  ensure compliance with environment  safeguards. The \nproject will impact a corridor about 0.30 meters (m) to 0.50 m wide on the sea floor, and in some \nlocations up to 0.75 m beneath the sediment. As it enters the near-shore waters, the alignment \nwill be on the seabed (essentially coral rubble and sand) at a sea depth of 40m to 50m in the \nshipping channel. The landing site will be an existing manhole, outfitted with a conduit running \nfrom  the  shore  into  the  Palau  National  Communications  Corporation  building.  A  detailed \noceanographic  survey  of  the  alignment  will  be  completed  during  the  design  period,  which  will \ninclude updating of the initial environmental examination and environmental management plan \nand  integration  of  the  updated  plan  in  the  contract  specifications.  The  PMU  will  monitor \ncompliance.  Overall  project  progress  reports  will  include  safeguards  and  will  be  submitted  to \nADB quarterly. Safeguard monitoring reports will be prepared separately and submitted to ADB \nsemiannually. \n \nF. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures  \n\n36.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail \nin  the  risk  assessment  and  risk  management  plan.27 The  integrated  benefits  and  impacts  are \nexpected to outweigh the costs.  \n \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures  \n \n\nMitigating Measures \n\nRisks \nLimited government experience in \nimplementing ADB projects, \nparticularly procurement \n\nNo dedicated BSCC staff to \nmanage finance and accounting \n\nMonopoly or collusion among local \nsupplier(s) prevent decrease in \nretail internet price \n\nThe proposed project is the second ADB project for Palau. ADB provided \ntechnical assistance to help Palau prepare the project. During implementation, \nADB will monitor progress closely. The procurement packages are designed to \nminimize the number of contracts to be managed. The PMU budget includes \nhiring implementation specialists to help implementation agencies. A simplified \ndisbursement process for all direct payments to suppliers and consultants will \nminimize issues in financial management and bookkeeping.  \nThe PMU will have experienced financial management consultants to support \nBSCC in setting up practices, systems, and procedures to manage accounting. \nA time-based action plan has been prepared to ensure the proper handover and \ntraining for BSCC permanent staff. \nTechnical assistance from the World Bank is helping Palau to implement its ICT \npolicy and set up the Office of the Regulator. The regulator is scheduled to be in \nplace by the end of Q1 2017, and will ensure fair and competitive pricing for \nretail users.  \n\nLack of consortium financing delays  Globe Telecom, Philippines, and Telin, Indonesia, are the two financiers for the \n                                                \n27 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\nimplementation of the SEA\u2013US \n\nSEA\u2013US.
