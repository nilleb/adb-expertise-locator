THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) for the Ningxia Liupanshan Poverty Reduction Rural \nRoad Development Project.1 \n \n2.  The proposed project will support poverty-focused rural road development and rural road \nsafety and sustainability in the lagging Liupanshan area of Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region \n(NHAR) under the nationwide initiative.2 The project is expected to increase rural incomes and \nreduce poverty in the Liupanshan area, and includes an impact evaluation of poverty reduction. \nThe project will align government and development partner support with the national poverty \nalleviation  initiative  and  the  NHAR  13th  Five-Year  Plan3\u2014resulting  in  poverty-focused \nimprovement of the rural transport network, improved road safety and maintenance practice, \nand strengthened institutional capacity.4    \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale   \n3.  Poverty in the Liupanshan area. The Liupanshan project area in the NHAR is one of \n14 contiguous high-poverty lagging areas targeted by the national government. It comprises \nseven of the NHAR\u2019s 21 counties,5 and its population of 2.39 million is just over one-third of the \nNHAR\u2019s total population. It is one of the poorest areas of the PRC, with 38% of the farmers \n(over 600,000 people) under the national poverty line of CNY2,300 of annual income per capita. \nHui minorities make up 59% of the population. According to the Poverty Alleviation Office (PAO) \nof the NHAR, 76% of the administrative villages in the project area are classified as poor. The \nNHAR targets eradication of poverty in the Liupanshan area by the end of 2018, with some \ncounties, including Pengyang, Longde, and Jingyuan, to be free of poverty by 2017.6 \n \n4.  Rural roads and poverty. Inadequate access is an important cause of the high levels of \npoverty,  related  to the mountainous topography  of  the  Liupanshan  area.  Poor connectivity \nbetween urban and rural areas constrains economic growth and limits the extent to which the \nbenefits of growth can be spread among the population. About 77% of people in the Liupanshan \narea rely on agriculture for their livelihood. Local farmers often travel along unpaved rural roads to \ntowns to sell their produce, but during rainy periods unpaved roads become impassable and \nperishable crops cannot reach the market. Poor accessibility also inflicts high costs to access \nsocial  services,  reduces  non-farming  employment  opportunities,  and  further  isolates  minority \ncommunities. Improved roads would provide poor farmers with more reliable access to economic \nopportunities,  information,  education,  health,  and  other  services.  It  is  therefore  essential  to \naccelerate the development of better roads to connect rural areas to urban growth centers and \nmarkets. The project includes an impact analysis of road development on poverty reduction, which \nwill provide key information for understanding the trickle-down effects on poverty reduction from \nrural road improvements in lagging areas.    \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  Government  of  the  PRC,  Ministry  of  the  State  Council  Leading  Group,  Office  of  Poverty  Alleviation  and \nDevelopment. 2011.

Yinchuan, NHAR.  \n4  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided project preparatory technical assistance for the Ningxia Liupanshan \nPoverty Reduction Rural Road Development Program (TA 8771-PRC).  \n5  The seven counties are Haiyuan, Jingyuan, Longde, Pengyang, Tongxin, Xiji, and Yuanzhou.  \n6  Ningxia Poverty Alleviation Office. 2016. 13th Five-Year Poverty Reduction Plan. Yinchuan, NHAR. \n ", "2 \n5.  Rural  road  improvement.  The  seven  project  counties  together  have  a  rural  road \nnetwork  of  11,600  kilometers  (km),  of  which  19%  are  class  III  and  78%  are  class  IV  or \nunderclass. Within the rural road network, 3,000 km are unpaved (almost exclusively village \nroads), and an additional 4,500 km of paved roads are in poor or very poor condition that \nrequires rehabilitation. The Ministry of Transport aims to improve the transport situation in the \npoverty areas as a basic requirement for poverty reduction,7 and has been allocating significant \nsubsidies to improving rural access in these designated poverty areas.8 This has resulted in the \nrural road network in Ningxia tripling in size and becoming largely paved. NHAR\u2019s 13th Five-\nYear Plan aims to provide paved road access to all the administrative villages (200 remaining). \nThe project targets the Liupanshan area as a whole and fills the priority gaps needed to \nenhance (i) direct connection to poor villages through rural feeder roads improvement, and (ii) \nurban\u2013rural connection through enhancement of the rural trunk road network. It will improve 435 \nkm of rural roads, benefiting 116,000 poor people.   \n  \n6.  Road maintenance and climate risks. The volume of medium maintenance9 carried \nout each year is insufficient to slow down deterioration of the poor-condition rural roads and \nkeep the rural road network in a maintainable state. In addition, climate change will result in an \nincrease in the intensity and frequency of extreme rainfall events and rainfall-induced floods, \nmudslides, and landslides in the mountainous topography and erosion-prone soil condition. \nMedium maintenance works are largely carried out by the maintenance stations, which lack \nskills and equipment, resulting in poor quality work that rapidly becomes damaged again. At the \nsame time, the maintenance stations spend much of their time on cleaning and clearing works \nthat are better outsourced to local residents, allowing the maintenance stations to focus on \nsmall pavement repairs. The project will enhance more sustainable maintenance practices \nthrough the use of skilled private contractors for medium maintenance and local women\u2019s \ngroups for routine maintenance. \n \n7.  Road safety. Road safety remains a significant issue. The project area contains many \nhigh-risk rural roads with significant traffic volume and a mix of heavy vehicles, automobiles, \nmotorcycles, nonmotorized vehicles, and pedestrians. Many accidents are attributed to driver \nerror aggravated by the steep, mountainous terrain. In many cases, dangerous road conditions \ncan be addressed by modest design interventions at relatively low cost. The development and \ninstitutionalization of modern road safety design and management approaches will lead to a \nsustainable reduction in road deaths and injuries. The project will improve rural road safety by \ndeveloping and implementing a system of road safety assessments and audits, which could be \nreplicated throughout the NHAR after successful implementation. \n \n8.  Strategic relevance and value addition. Maintaining sustainable rural connectivity is a \nstrategic priority of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) country partnership strategy for the \nPRC.10 The project is aligned with ADB\u2019s Sustainable Transport Initiative11 in the areas of \npoverty reduction, road safety, and social sustainability and with the NHAR\u2019s 13th Five-Year \nPlan on poverty reduction and transport. The project has drawn on lessons from the Ningxia \n                                                \n7  Government of the PRC, Ministry of Transport. 2013.

Beijing. \n8  Three-quarters of all rural road investments in 2011\u20132015 were allocated to providing paved road access to \nadministrative villages. \n9  Maintenance  activities  are  grouped  into  minor  (routine)  maintenance,  medium  maintenance,  and  major \nmaintenance. Medium maintenance aims to restore the original technical condition of the road and includes \nrepairing general damage and periodic improvement of road conditions. \n10 ADB. 2016.

Impact and Outcome \n9.  The impact will be increased rural incomes and reduced incidence of poverty in the \nLiupanshan area. The outcome will be an improved rural transport network in Liupanshan, \nparticularly in poor areas. \n \nC.  Outputs \n10.  Output 1: Priority rural roads rehabilitated and upgraded. This component includes \n(i) rehabilitation and upgrading of high-volume rural trunk roads connecting high-poverty areas \nwith national or provincial highways, and (ii) rehabilitation and paving of rural feeder roads \nreaching further into poor villages. Specific outputs include improvement of (i) seven rural trunk \nroads (266.7 km) connecting 63 administrative villages (42 of which are poor) and 126 natural \nvillages;14 and (ii) 21 rural feeder roads (168.3 km) linking 47 administrative villages (41 of which \nare designated poor) and 111 natural villages (84 of which lack paved road access). Output 1 \nalso incorporates road safety and climate adaptation measures for the project roads. \n \n11.  Output 2: Rural road safety and sustainability enhanced. Project assistance to the \ncounty  transport  bureaus  (CTBs)  will  enhance  the  coverage  and  efficiency  of  maintenance \nimplementation by engaging women\u2019s maintenance groups for routine off-pavement maintenance \non all project feeder roads and by outsourcing medium maintenance works to private contractors. \nWomen\u2019s  maintenance  groups  will  carry  out  routine  maintenance,  with  initial  support  to  be \nprovided through technical assistance funded by the Gender and  Development Cooperation \nFund.15 This assistance will develop a strategy for the replication and mainstreaming of the \napproach in the area. The project will also carry out road safety audits for the rural trunk roads, \nincorporating the recommendations into the project designs, and provide capacity building and \nsupport to the CTBs to carry out road safety assessments on the existing rural roads. \n \n12.  Output  3:  Impact  evaluation  conducted  and  project  implementation  capacity \nimproved. An impact evaluation will measure the impact of the project on poverty reduction in \nthe Liupanshan target area. The project will conduct an end-line survey together with the \nanalysis, following the predesigned evaluation methods and using a baseline survey to be \nconducted in 2016 employing e-survey tools.16 The PAOs of the NHAR and the project counties \n                                                \n12 ADB. 2013.

The government has requested a loan of $100 million (CNY662.4 million) from ADB\u2019s \nordinary capital resources to help finance the project. The loan will have a 26-year term, \nincluding a grace period of 5 years, an annual interest rate determined in accordance with \nADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility,17 a commitment charge of \n0.15% per year (the interest and other charges during construction to be capitalized in the loan), \nand such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan and project agreements. The \ngovernment has requested that repayment follow the straight-line repayment option. \n \n15.  The Government of the PRC is the borrower and will make the loan available, through \nthe  NHAR  government,  to  the  responsible  county  governments  on  the  same  terms  and \nconditions as those of the ADB loan. The government will finance the remaining amount of \n$165.54 million of the project cost, including contingencies. The NHAR and county governments \nwill  assume  the  foreign  exchange  and  interest  variation  risks  of  the  ADB  loan,  including \ncontingencies.

Implementation Arrangements \n16.  The Ningxia Government Foreign Debt Leading Group will oversee the coordination of \nthe whole project. The leading group members include the Ningxia Department of Finance, the \nNingxia Development and Reform Commission, the Ningxia Department of Transport (NDOT), \nand the Ningxia PAO. The Ningxia Foreign Debt Management Office will be in charge of overall \nmanagement of the project. \n \n17.  The NHAR government is the executing agency. Under the oversight of the Ningxia \nGovernment Foreign Debt Leading Group, the NDOT will coordinate and supervise project \ndevelopment and implementation. A project management office (PMO) has been established \nunder the NDOT and will have eight staff qualified in road engineering, road safety, finance, \nprocurement, social issues, and environment. The PMO will coordinate project activities during \nthe preparation and implementation phases and will be the focal point among relevant NHAR \nagencies, the CTBs, and ADB. Civil works for rural trunk roads will be procured by the CTBs, \nwith support and guidance from the PMO through national competitive bidding procedures. Civil \nworks for rural feeder roads will be procured by the CTBs following the PRC\u2019s country systems. \nADB-financed consultants (individual and firm) will be engaged under the PMO in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time). \n \n18.  Additional financing may be considered, if the project performs well, to enhance its \nimpacts. In such a case, the original loan may be used to achieve readiness for the additional \nfinancing.

DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical \n19.  Planning. The sector assessment reveals deficiencies in the previous planning practices \nfocused on developing a high-class network of north\u2013south and east\u2013west roads, without taking \nsufficient  account  of  traffic  forecasts  and  upgrading  needs,  causing  over-dimensioning  in \nseveral cases. Consequently, rehabilitation received insufficient attention, despite two-fifths of \nthe rural road network being in poor or very poor condition. Road improvements for connecting \npoor villages were not prioritized systematically and often drew on the personal knowledge and \njudgment of CTB staff. The project roads were selected to enhance poverty impact, among \nother things, by prioritizing connection to poverty villages identified by the Ningxia PAO. The \nproject\u2019s road works were designed for (i) rehabilitation and paving of roads in poor and very \npoor  conditions,  aimed  at  providing  and  reinstating  paved  road  access  to  rural  poor \ncommunities without any change to the technical class of the roads; and (ii) upgrading of rural \ntrunk roads with justifiable traffic volumes to a higher technical class, in line with national \nstandards. \n \n20.  Sustainability. The massive scale of rural road construction in 2000\u20132009 was not \ncomplemented  by  a  similar  increase  in  maintenance funding  and  implementation capacity. \nRoutine  maintenance  is  often  lacking,  especially  in  lower  level  rural  roads,  leading  to \nwidespread damage. The sustainability of rural roads was put at further risk by a lack of medium \nmaintenance  and  the  poor  quality  of  major  maintenance  works,  causing  accelerated \ndeterioration of the rural road network. The project includes a specific component aimed at \nimproving rural road maintenance coverage and implementation, and enhancing CTB capacity \nfor  outsourcing  off-pavement  routine  maintenance  to  local  women\u2019s  groups  and  medium \nmaintenance works to qualified private contractors. \n \n21.  Rural road safety. Increasing traffic volumes and speeds on rural roads is leading to \nmore traffic accidents and fatalities. The NHAR has been funding road safety engineering \nmeasures since 2015, with road safety assessments carried out in most county roads. However, \nthe CTBs tend to lack skilled experts and guidelines for road safety. The project will pay specific \nattention to enhancing skills for conducting road safety assessments and applying road safety \naudits to rural trunk roads. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n22.  Economic analysis. A cost\u2013benefit analysis has been conducted for the rural trunk roads \npackage as well as the rural feeder roads. Overall, the project is economically viable with an \neconomic internal rate of return (EIRR) of 13.5%. The evaluations of individual trunk roads show \nEIRRs of 10.2%\u201318.1% and a combined EIRR of 13.8%. At the county level, when the rural \n ", "7 \nfeeder roads are added, the EIRRs are 7.8%\u201318.3%. The improvement from unpaved to paved \nrural feeder roads is further justified through the unquantified socioeconomic impacts of improved \nyear-round accessibility to markets and services directly targeting the poor population, including \nethnic minorities. These socioeconomic benefits are expected to include (i) increased agricultural \nproduction and marketing; (ii) local market development; (iii) increased wages, consumption, and \nemployment; (iv) reduced poverty; (v) positive impacts on transport speeds, costs, and travel \npatterns; (vi) improved access to health services and education; and (vii) benefits for women. \n \n23.  Financial analysis. The financial sustainability analysis for the project indicates that \ncounterpart funding availability and debt service from the project counties are acceptable in \ncomparison  with  overall  local  government  revenues  and  expenditures.  Average  annual \ncounterpart  funding  is  estimated  to  account  for  10.2%  of  the  projected  local  government \nrevenues and 0.6% of the expenditures during the implementation period. Annual debt service \nis estimated to be 2.3% of projected government revenues in the first year of repayment and will \ndecline thereafter. There is a risk that operation and maintenance will be underfunded. Although \nthe annual minimum operation and maintenance requirement is 0.01%\u20130.07% of projected \nrevenues during 2019\u20132025, it has historically been given low priority. Local governments are \nunder some funding pressure because of their poor fiscal history, but the central and provincial \ngovernments will provide the necessary support given the important role this project will play in \nachieving the poverty reduction goal in the Liupanshan area. \n \nC.  Governance \n \n24.  All procurement to be financed under the ADB loan will be carried out in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2015, as amended from time to time). Financial management \nrisk  is  considered  moderate,  as  is  procurement  risk,  despite  the  involvement  of  multiple \nimplementing agencies (CTBs) and lack of experience of the PMO and the CTBs in ADB \nprojects, because of the existence and correct application of generally accepted accounting \nprinciples. To mitigate these risks, action plans have been prepared for both procurement and \nfinancial matters. PMO and CTB staff will be trained in ADB procurement and disbursement \nprocedures  and  guidelines.  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was \nexplained to and discussed with the governments of PRC and the NHAR. The relevant sections \nof ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy will be included in all procurement documents and contracts. The \nspecific policy requirements and supplementary measures are described in the PAM (footnote \n18).  \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n25.  Poverty. A total of 702,600 poor people accounts for 17.4% of the total rural population, \nand 1,100 villages designated as poor account for 48.1% of the total number of villages. The \naverage gross domestic product per capita in the project counties was CNY12,778 in 2013, \nwhich was only 32.4% of the NHAR average and 30.5% of the national average. The economic \ndevelopment level measured by gross domestic product per capita varies considerably within \nthe project counties. Yuanzhou county had the highest level, 120% higher than that of Haiyuan. \nThe most important causes of poverty in the Liupanshan area are insufficient access to credit, \nillness and medical expense, lack of employment opportunities and labor skills, and bad road \nconditions that limit transportation of products and access to schools, services, and markets. \n \n26.  The  project  is  a  geographically  targeted  poverty  intervention.  The  number  of  poor \nbeneficiaries comprises 52% of the total beneficiaries.  The improvement of rural feeder roads \nwill  provide  direct  access  to  rural  farmsteads  and  fields,  generating  new  opportunities  for \n ", "8 \nfarmers to shift to higher-value crops, increase production, and market directly to traders. A \npositive impact on farmgate prices, and consequently incomes, is expected. Year-round access \nwill be delivered as the project will connect poor villages to the surfaced road network. The \nproject will conduct an impact evaluation study to assess the impact of the road improvements \non poverty reduction. \n \n27.  Social and gender. Better road connectivity and reduced transport costs and travel time \nwill  also  improve  access  to  employment  opportunities  and  social  services.  The  project  is \nestimated to create about 1,800 jobs during the construction period, of which 760 will be \nunskilled jobs and 1,040 will be skilled jobs. The road safety output of the project will result in \nsafer roads. The project is categorized as effective gender mainstreaming, as improved road \nconditions will benefit women with easier, faster, and safer travel; increase their mobility; and \nfacilitate more productive use of their time. Measures to address gender issues in project design \nand  implementation  have  been  incorporated  in  the  gender  action  plan  and  other  project \ndocuments. Specific measures include (i) traffic safety improvements incorporated in the project \ndesign, (ii) public participation meetings at all stages of the project  involving at least 50% \nwomen, (iii) 30% of total unskilled construction jobs for local women, and (iv) training and \nemployment  of  local  women  in  at  least  22  road  maintenance  groups.  Project  information \ndissemination, training, and other activities will be conducted in times and places convenient to \nwomen with respect to their schedule and in a manner that women can easily understand. \nWomen will be equally entitled to compensation for land acquisition and house demolition. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n28.  Environment.  The  project  is  category  B  for  environment.  A  consolidated  initial \nenvironmental examination and an environmental management plan (EMP), which cover all \nproject components, have been prepared. These documents comply with the PRC\u2019s regulatory \nrequirements and ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), and was disclosed on the ADB \nwebsite in August 2016. Public consultations were carried out to inform the project design and \nenvironmental assessment process, and will continue during project implementation. Capacity \ndevelopment and institutional strengthening will be provided to minimize environmental risks. \nEnvironmental  complaints  will  be  handled  through  a  project  safeguards  grievance  redress \nmechanism. Carbon dioxide emissions are estimated at about 84,000 tons in 2033 from the \nseven rural trunk roads and less than 100,000 tons in 2030 for the 21 rural feeder roads. Total \ncarbon  dioxide  emissions  from  the  project  roads  will  be  less  than  the  ADB  threshold  of \n100,000 tons/year in the long term. \n \n29.  All proposed rural trunk roads and rural feeder roads are existing roads proposed for \nimprovement. Anticipated construction environmental impacts are fugitive dust, noise, water \nquality impacts, and disposal of solid waste. One of the rural trunk roads is about 500 meters \nfrom  the  Yunwushan  National  Nature  Reserve,  which  is  designated  to  protect  grassland \nresources.  The  EMP  and  project  assurances  include  specific  protection  measures  for  the \nreserve. The major operational impacts are noise and greenhouse gas emissions associated \nwith increases in traffic volume. The EMP outlines potential impacts, mitigation and monitoring \nmeasures,  institutional  arrangements,  training  requirements,  and  an  environment \nimplementation budget that is 0.8% of the total project budget. \n \n30.  Climate change risk. The project is classified at medium risk from climate change. A \nclimate risk and vulnerability analysis indicated an increased risk of extreme rainfall events, \nflooding, and landslides as a result of climate change. During the detailed design, a 15% \nincrease in design flood discharge will be used to examine the adequacy of bridge and culvert \ndesign under future climate conditions. An assurance requiring the consideration of climate risk \n ", "9 \nand adaptation measures has been included in the project agreement. A range of hard and soft \nadaptation measures will be considered, and measures adopted and the incremental cost of \nadaptation will be confirmed following detailed design. \n \n31.  Involuntary resettlement. The project is category B for involuntary resettlement. Land \nacquisition and resettlement (LAR) impacts are mainly to the rural trunk roads and two rural \nfeeder roads. Rural road improvement will result in partial LAR impacts, as they are existing \nroads. The LAR impacts have been adequately assessed, and eight resettlement plans have \nbeen prepared and disclosed on the ADB website. For the rural trunk roads and two rural feeder \nroads,19 an estimated 6,446 mu20 of land will be acquired permanently and 8,775 square meters \nof housing structures will be demolished. Land acquisition and house demolition will affect 2,031 \nhouseholds with 8,780 persons. No household will lose more than 10% of farmland, and only \nnine households with 33 persons will suffer complete house demolition and are regarded as \nseverely affected. For the other 19 rural feeder roads, it is estimated that 825 mu\u2013925 mu of \nfarmland (99% is dry farmland) will be acquired, 541 households will be affected in 38 villages, \nand no house will be demolished. The amount of ground attachments, which mainly include \nyoung crop and public facilities, will be measured after the preliminary engineering design. \nCapacity building for implementing agencies on social safeguards implementation is integrated \ninto the project design. Affected people were sufficiently consulted during the preparation of the \nresettlement plans. Approved resettlement plans will be disclosed to the affected people and on \nthe  ADB  website.  The  estimated  cost  of  LAR  is  CNY98.66  million\u2014including  land \ncompensation; house relocation; and livelihood support, taxes, fees, and contingency funds. \nThe NHAR government confirmed that adequate counterpart funding would be made available \nfor  LAR.  An  independent  agency  will  monitor  resettlement  implementation  and  produce \nsemiannual  reports.  Public  consultations  will  continue  throughout  the  project  cycle,  and  a \ngrievance-redress mechanism will be established. \n \n32.  Indigenous peoples. The project is category B for ethnic minorities. The Hui are the \nsole ethnic minority in the project area and the overwhelming population along most of the \nproposed rural trunk and feeder roads. Over 86% of the direct beneficiaries are Hui. Some \nminor  impacts  will  occur  during  road  construction  and  operation,  but  these  will  not  have \nsignificant negative impacts on ethnic culture, social life, religion, or economic development. An \nethnic minority development plan (EMDP) has been prepared to ensure that the Hui benefit \npositively from the proposed rural road project and that any negative social impact, direct or \nindirect, is mitigated or avoided. The actions outlined in the EMDP and integrated into the \nproject, in coordination with other stakeholders, are (i) road safety awareness, (ii) ethnic minority \ncultural awareness building for the contractors with the county Ethnic and Religious Affairs \nCommittees, and (iii) communicable disease prevention training for villagers by the Chinese \nCenter for Disease Control and Prevention. The executing and implementing agencies agreed \nto  provide  funds  and  implement  the  specified  activities  as  indicated  in  the  EMDP.  Public \nconsultations  were  conducted  through  formal  and  informal  focus  group  discussions  from \nOctober 2015 and will continue throughout the project period by the PMO safeguards focal \npersons, including consultants and the external monitor. A grievance redress mechanism will be \nestablished to address affected people\u2019s concerns. An independent agency will monitor EMDP \nimplementation and produce semiannual reports. \n \n                                                \n19 These two rural feeder roads were included in the Jingyuan and Longde resettlement plans while the other 19 rural \nfeeder  roads  were  included  in  Resettlement  Plan:  Other  Feeder  Roads  (accessible  from the list  of linked \ndocuments in Appendix 2). \n20 A mu is a Chinese unit of measurement (1 mu = 666.67 m2). \n ", "10 \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n33.  The overall risk assessment is deemed to be medium. The integrated benefits and \nimpacts  are  expected  to  outweigh  the  costs.  Major  risks  and  mitigating  measures  are \nsummarized in Table 4 and described in detail in the risk assessment and risk management \nplan.21 \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigation Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nDelays in counterpart funding  (i) Covenanted assurances from Ningxia Department of Transport and county \ncaused by unexpected financial  transport bureaus for timely provision of counterpart funding, and \nneeds or policy changes  (ii) counties to be required to make formal budget provision for their project \nfinancing obligations. \nDelays in the procurement  (i) Training in project management and planning, \nprocess (including delays resulting  (ii) use of standard bidding documents and Asian Development Bank advance \nfrom the practice of submitting  contracting facility, and \nunrealistically low bids)  (iii) engagement of procurement agents. \nLack of sustainability caused by  (i) Output 2 of the project (rural road safety and sustainability enhanced) will \nunderfunding of road maintenance  enhance maintenance efficiency through outsourcing and training of county \nand minor repairs   transport bureaus, and \n(ii) provision of adequate maintenance budget for the project roads covenanted. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \nIV.  ASSURANCES \n34.  The governments of PRC and NHAR have assured ADB that implementation of the project \nwill conform to all applicable ADB policies, including those concerning anticorruption measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail in \nthe PAM and loan documents. The governments of PRC and NHAR have agreed with ADB on \ncertain  covenants  for  the  project,  which  are  set  forth  in  the  loan  agreement  and  project \nagreement. \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n35.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  of \n$100,000,000 to the People\u2019s Republic of China for the Ningxia Liupanshan Poverty Reduction \nRural Road Development Project, from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, with interest to be \ndetermined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending \nfacility; for a term of 26 years, including a grace period of 5 years; and such other terms and \nconditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft loan and project \nagreements presented to the Board. \n \n \n \nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n29 September 2016 \n                                                \n21 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "Appendix 1  11 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nImpacts the Project is Aligned With \nRural incomes in the Liupanshan area increased (13th Five-Year Plan of Ningxia Hui Autonomous \nRegion)a \nIncidence of poverty in the Liupanshan area reduced (13th Five-Year Plan of Ningxia Hui Autonomous \nRegion)a \nData Sources and \nPerformance Indicators with  Reporting \nResults Chain  Targets and Baselines  Mechanisms  Risks \nOutcome       \nRural transport  By 2021:     \nnetwork in  a.
