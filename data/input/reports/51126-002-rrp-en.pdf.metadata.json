From fiscal year (FY) 2013 to FY2016, the Sindh economy grew by \nan average of more than 4.0% and this rate accelerated to 5.3% in FY2017. The province benefits \nfrom  a  strategic  location,  a  young  and  growing  workforce,  a  wealth  of  resources,  and  an \nexpanding  services  sector.  These  strengths,  coupled  with  Karachi\u2019s  position  as  the  financial \ncenter of Pakistan, provide the potential for Sindh to transform itself into a key driver of economic \ngrowth  in  the  country.  Despite  these  advantages,  Sindh  has  yet  to translate  this  potential  into \neconomic  and  social  development. 2  While  a  range  of  economic  and  institutional  reforms  is \nrequired  to  increase  Sindh\u2019s  economic  and  social  potential  and  generate  inclusive  growth, \neducation reforms are critically important if the province\u2019s education sector is to play its role in \ndeveloping workers with 21st century skills. \n \n4. \nEducation  sector  context.  The  18th  Constitutional  Amendment  of  2010  devolved \nresponsibility for 17 sectors, including education, to provincial governments. The reform ushered \nin a new education policy framework for provincial governments, including a requirement for the \nstate  to  provide  free  and  compulsory  quality  education  to  children  aged  5\u201316  years,  and \nresponsibility for policy areas that were previously shared with the federal government, including \neducation  standards,  curriculum,  and  policy  and  planning.  The  School  Education  and  Literacy \nDepartment (SELD), which oversees school education in Sindh, has since introduced important \npolicy  reforms,  including  merit-based  recruitment  of  teachers,  standardized  assessment  of \nlearning levels, and the expansion of public\u2013private partnerships (PPPs).3 \n \nThe  SELD  has  also  developed  the  Sindh  Education  Sector  Plan  (SESP),  2014\u22122018, \n5. \nwhich sets out strategies to improve the performance of the province\u2019s education sector, including \nexpanding educational access in underserved areas, recruiting qualified teachers, improving the \npublic examination system, and developing better school infrastructure.4 The GOS is preparing a \nfollow-up SESP, 2019\u20132023. The GOS increased education spending by 39% between FY2015 \nand FY2018. This helped to lift the share of education in the GOS budget to 20%, or about 1.5% \nof provincial gross domestic product. \n \n\nschool (grades 9\u201310).  \n\n \n\n1  Secondary education is defined as grades 6\u201310 and is made up of students in middle school (grades 6\u20138) and high \n\n2  World Bank. 2017.

Sindh Education Sector Plan 2014\u2013\n\n18.  \n\n \n\n\fEducation  sector  challenges.  Despite  these  positive  reforms,  the  education  sector  in \n6. \nSindh continues to face significant challenges in terms of access to, and the quality of, education. \nThe continuing poor performance of the province\u2019s education system led the GOS to declare an \neducation emergency in 2016. Of the 22.8 million out-of-school children in Pakistan, 28% are in \nSindh.5 Sindh  has  the  second-lowest  gross  enrollment  ratios  (GERs)  and  net  enrollment  rates \n(NERs)  at  all  education  levels,  after  Balochistan,  among  the  four  provinces,  despite  growing \nabsolute enrollments.6 Progress in lifting enrollments has been uneven. From school year (SY) \n2008/09 to SY2014/15, the GER in Sindh fell from 59% to 55% at the middle school level and \nrose from 47% to 51% at the high school level. NERs are lower than GERs because of the large \nnumber of overage students in schools. This is due to low enrollments at the primary level and \nhigh dropout rates, especially after grade 5, when 31% of public school students drop out.7  \n \nSector  challenges  are  particularly  acute  at  the  secondary  education  level.  The  lack  of \n7. \nsecondary  schools  is  a major  constraint  to  increasing  enrollments  in  Sindh,  especially  in  rural \nareas, where there are fewer affordable private educational alternatives. Only about 10% of public \nschools in the province are secondary schools. In rural areas, this figure drops to just 7%. The \nlack of secondary schools can have a significant impact on girls\u2019 enrollments because parents \nmay  not  allow  girls  to  attend  distant  schools.  Poor  learning  environments  also  discourage \ncontinued enrollment. This is of concern given that, in SY2016/17, only 33% of public schools in \nSindh  had  buildings  rated  satisfactory,  while  55%  lacked  electricity,  and  40%  lacked  basic \nfacilities such as boundary walls, drinking water, and toilets. While the provision of basic facilities \nis better in secondary schools, these schools lack advanced facilities, such as laboratories. For \nexample, in SY2016/17, only 15% of the province\u2019s secondary schools had a physics laboratory.8 \n \nAccess  challenges  in  Sindh  are  exacerbated  by  significant  disparities  in  access  and \n8. \nlearning  across  gender, socioeconomic groups, and districts.  In  SY2014/15, the  NER  for  boys \naged 14\u201315 years was 9 percentage points higher than for girls (29% versus 20%) and the gap \nin  the  literacy  rate  for  males  and  females  aged  10  and  older  was  21  percentage  points  (70% \nversus  49%). 9 Disparities  also  exist  across  districts  in  Sindh.  Education  indicators,  such  as \nprimary school transition rates and literacy rates, in project districts such as Thatta, Badin, Matiari, \nSujawal,  Tharparkar,  and  Sanghar  are  below\u2014and  in  some  cases  well  below\u2014the  provincial \naverage  (footnote  8).  Low  incomes  and  the  opportunity  cost  of  girls\u2019  time  may  limit  education \naccess,  even  though  the  GOS  operates  a  stipend  scheme for  girls,  and  schools  run  by  some \neducation management organizations (EMOs) provide transportation for girls. \n \n9. \nQuality is also a significant challenge in the Sindh education sector. Learning levels are \nvery  low  at  the  secondary  level.  The  mean  score  in  the  province\u2019s  grade  8  standardized \nachievement test in SY2016/17 was 30.3%, up from 27.8% in 2015/16. In SY2016/17, the mean \nsubject  scores  were  40%  for  language,  21% for mathematics,  and  26% for  science.10 Data  for \n2017 show that grade 10 students in Sindh performed poorly (in absolute terms and compared to \nthe  national  average)  on  assessments  designed  to  test  their  competency  in  mathematics  and \n\nStatistics 2016/17.

Uneven deployment of teachers; lack of trained teachers, especially subject \nspecialists;  lack  of  female  teachers  in  remote  areas;  and  poor  teacher  motivation  and \naccountability are major challenges. Of the 151,000 public school teachers in Sindh in SY2016/17, \nfewer than 30% were female, only  20% were at the secondary level, and fewer than 1% were \nsubject specialists. Previous hiring policies have resulted in a large pool of unqualified teachers \nin public schools\u2014about 20% of teachers have a higher secondary education qualification or less \n(footnote  8).  Pre-  and  in-service  teacher  training  requires  substantial  improvement.  The \naccountability  framework  provides  few  incentives  for  teachers  to  perform.  The  poor  quality  of \nschools hinders learning and lowers enrollments as parents see little value in educating children. \n \n11.  Weaknesses in teacher training, quality, management, and accountability are exacerbated \nby  an  outdated  secondary  education  examination  system,  particularly  for  grades  9\u201312  where \nboard  examinations  are  mandatory.  Weaknesses  in  the  current  examination  system  are  well \ndocumented.  They  include  (i)  an  emphasis  on  rote  memorization  rather  than  critical  thinking;        \n(ii)  poor  test  preparation,  including  frequent  repetition  of  examination  items  across  years  and \nuneven coverage of the curriculum; (iii) weak capacity of examination writers and markers, which \nis exacerbated by the lack of university training programs in these subject areas; and (iv) rampant \nmalpractice and corruption in the administration of board examinations.12 \n \n12.  While additional spending can help improve the performance of the education system, this \nalone  will  not  be  enough,  given  that  a  significant  proportion  of  allocated  public  funds\u2014and \nparticularly the development budget\u2014goes unspent due to bottlenecks and capacity limitations \nthat  hinder  effective  and  timely  fund  flows  and spending  on  key  inputs.  To  improve  education \nsector performance, the GOS has made greater use of PPPs by expanding and refocusing the \nSindh Education Foundation (SEF), which subsidizes students to attend low-fee private schools; \nand by introducing the EMO program, under which the government contracts private partners to \noperate  public  schools.  Private  providers,  including  nongovernment  organizations,  will  play  a \nsignificant role in the project given their role in managing schools under the EMO program. \n \n13. \nStrategic fit. There is considerable complementarity between the project and the SESP, \n2014\u22122018 (and the follow-up SESP, 2019\u20132023), including in expanding educational access in \nunderserved areas, recruiting qualified teachers, improving the public examination system, and \ndeveloping  better  school  infrastructure  (footnote  4).  The  European  Union,  the  United  States \nAgency for International Development, and the World Bank have been key development partners \nsupporting education in Sindh. The project supports three of the key operational priority areas in \nADB\u2019s  Strategy  2030:  addressing  remaining  poverty  and  reducing  inequalities,  accelerating \nprogress in gender equality, and strengthening governance and institutional capacity.  \n \n14. \nValue  added  by  ADB  assistance.  The  project  adds  value  by  focusing  on  secondary \neducation,  which  faces  significant  access  and  quality  challenges  and  yet  receives  less \ndevelopment  partner  assistance.  The  project  will  also  support  key  initiatives  such  as  the \nexpansion  of  the  EMO  program,  strengthening  of  subject  specialists  in  five  key  subjects,  and \nimprovements to the examination system. The development of a teacher training and mentoring \nprogram may provide a model for future teacher training, with more sustainable impacts.

The project heeds the lessons of ADB\u2019s education sector experience, \nincluding the importance of strong policy commitment and ownership, as reflected in the GOS\u2019s \nSESP, 2014\u20132018. The small size and limited focus of the project recognize the need for realistic \nproject objectives and time frames. The use of a dedicated independent project implementation \nunit  (PIU)  with  strong  capacity  reflects  the  importance  of  effective  implementation.  The  use  of \nprivate  school  managers  recognizes  the  need  for  effective  school  operation  and  construction. \nIndependent  verification  of  EMO  key  performance  indicators  and  independent  supervision  of \nconstruction reflect the need for effective monitoring and evaluation of project outcomes. \n \nB. \n \n16. \nThe project is aligned with the following impact: Inclusive and equitable quality education \nfor all ensured (Sustainable Development Goal 4).13 The project will have the following outcome: \nInclusiveness of secondary education system in Sindh increased.14 \n \nC. \n \nThe project has three outputs: (i) new secondary school blocks constructed, and operated \n17. \nunder  EMO  program,  (ii)  teaching  capacity  in  five  key  subjects  improved,  and  (iii)  secondary \neducation examination system strengthened. \n \n18. \nOutput  1:  New  secondary  school  blocks  constructed,  and  operated  under  EMO \nprogram.  The project  will  finance  the  construction of  about  160  new  secondary  school  blocks \nwithin existing SELD school compounds, largely in 10 districts in southern Sindh.15 The districts \nwere  chosen  based  on  their  socioeconomic  and  education  indicators.16 More  districts  may  be \nadded depending on the capacity of the initial 10 to absorb new secondary school blocks. School \nsites will (i) be identified from the SELD\u2019s list of 4,560 priority schools; (ii) emphasize schools that \nenroll  girls;  and  (iii)  be  selected  based  on  social  and  technical  assessments,  including  the \npresence of sufficient demand for secondary education in the area. School blocks will incorporate \ngender-responsive features and will be outfitted with solar power.17 An independent construction \nsupervision firm will monitor civil works. \n \n19. \nPrivate partners will operate secondary school blocks under the SELD\u2019s EMO program, \nwhich was developed in 2015. Under the program, SELD selects private EMO operators through \na competitive process. EMO operators are responsible for all aspects of school management and \nare  paid  based  on  performance.  EMO-operated  schools  do  not  charge  tuition  fees.  The  GOS \nfinances  contracts  with  EMOs.  The  SELD  may  improve  the  EMO  program,  based  on \nimplementation  experience. 18  The  SELD  may  also  update  the  education  PPP  framework, \nincluding  by  revising  the  governance  of  PPPs,  strengthening  the  SELD  PPP  node,  and \nstreamlining EMO contracting.  \n\n13 Government of Sindh. 2017.

This output will support \n20. \nthe introduction of a teacher training and mentoring program aimed at improving the teaching of \nEnglish,  mathematics,  biology,  chemistry,  and  physics  in  selected  SELD  and  SEF  secondary \nschools.  The  project  will  (i)  assess  teacher  availability  and  training  requirements,  (ii)  develop \nteacher  training  modules,  (iii)  provide  classroom  training  and  in-class  mentoring  by  subject \nspecialist  master  trainers  to  about  2,630  teachers  using  information  and  communication \ntechnology, and (iv) provide laboratory equipment to some existing secondary schools. The SELD \nand the SEF will contract private providers to train and mentor teachers. The program will also \nbuild the capacity of selected Sindh teacher training institutes and the Sindh Provincial Institute \nof Teacher Education. It will incorporate gender-sensitive strategies such as the use of gender-\nbias-free lesson materials and gender-neutral language and classroom management techniques. \n \nOutput 3: Secondary education examination system strengthened. This output will \n21. \nsupport the development of a uniform examination syllabus and specifications for grades 9\u201312 \nfor  the  Sindh  boards  of  intermediate  and  secondary  education  (BISE).  It  will  also  support  the \nredesign  of  the  content  of  these  examinations  to  increase  their  emphasis  on  critical  thinking. \nFinally, the project will support the provision of optical mark recognition systems to improve the \ntransparency, accuracy, and efficiency of examination grading. This assistance will be provided \nto all BISE in Sindh and will include the provision of hardware and software, and the development \nof  the  capacity  of  BISE  examination  assessors.  About  400  BISE  assessors  will  benefit  from \ncapacity development in item writing and exam development, while 85 BISE staff will benefit from \ntraining in optical mark recognition operation, data analysis and research.  \n \nD. \n \n22. \n \n23. \nDetailed  cost  estimates  by  expenditure  category  and  by  financier  are  in  the  project \nadministration manual (PAM).19 The project cost includes physical and price contingencies and a \nGOS in-kind contribution of $7.5 million that covers project implementation costs.

Advance \n28. \naction will cover the recruitment of key PIU staff, procurement of PIU equipment, furniture, and \nvehicles,  recruitment  of  teacher  training  and  assessment  firm,  and  architectural  design  and \nconstruction  supervision  firm.  Retroactive  financing  will  cover  (i)  key  PIU  positions  (project \ndirector,  project  manager,  chief  financial  management  specialist,  chief  procurement  specialist, \nengineer, and administration unit head); (ii) PIU equipment, furniture, and vehicles; and (iii) the \narchitectural  design  and  construction  supervision  firm.  Retroactive  financing  must  be  incurred \nwithin 12 months of the date of the loan agreement, with a ceiling of 20% of the ADB loan amount. \nRetroactive financing will be less than 1% of the loan amount. ADB advised the GOS that approval \nof advance action and retroactive financing does not commit ADB to finance the project. \n \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nTechnical \n\n \nA. \n \n29. \nThe  project  will  support  the  construction  of  secondary  school  blocks.  These  will  have \nimproved  features  compared  with  existing  SELD  secondary  schools,  including  well-equipped \nlaboratories, a combined library and digital classroom, drinking water, separate girls\u2019 and boys\u2019 \ntoilets, and solar power. Schools will be run by EMOs, which can ensure the sustainable use of \nfacilities  and  equipment.  The  teacher  training  program  will  provide  equipment  for  science \nlaboratories. BISE have the capacity to use and maintain the optical mark recognition systems. \nAll facilities will meet or exceed national construction codes. \n \nB. \n \n30. \nThe project will generate substantial economic benefits as a result of (i) increased access \nto,  and  completion  of,  secondary  education  due  to  the  construction  of  new  secondary  school \nblocks; and (ii) an increased wage premium for secondary school completers due to improved \nquality of education from the use of private managers for public schools, strengthened teaching \nand learning, and improvements to the design and administration of the Sindh public examination \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\fsystem.21 Expanded access to secondary education will lift the lifetime incomes of the increased \nnumber of students who complete secondary school, given the estimated rate of return of 7.3% \nfor  each  additional  year  of  schooling  in  Pakistan.22 In  addition  to  opening  up  access  for  more \nstudents, a larger proportion of students will complete grade 10 due to improved school facilities. \nImproved quality of secondary education will increase the wage premium by a modest amount for \nthose who complete secondary school. \n \n31. \nThe project economic internal rate of return (EIRR) is estimated at 11.92%, indicating its \neconomic  viability.  Improved  secondary  education  can  be  expected  to  produce  nonmonetary \nbenefits such as reduced fertility, better health and nutrition, and reduced social unrest due to \nyouth unemployment. A sensitivity analysis showed that the EIRR remains robust. The EIRR is \nnot  very  sensitive  to  changes  in  the  grade  10  completion  rates  but  is  somewhat  sensitive  to \nchanges in the wage premium from better-quality education and the combined scenario where \nthere is no change in completion rates and a lower wage premium increase. In all cases, the EIRR \nexceeds the required 6% rate for social sector projects. \n \nThe financial sustainability analysis highlights that the additional recurrent expenditures \n32. \narising  from  the  project  are  small  relative  to  the  GOS\u2019s  current  revenue  expenditure,  and \nprovincial  revenues  are  increasing  faster  than  federal  government  transfers.23 The  maximum \nproject-related loan repayment as a share of total GOS current revenue expenditures would be \nlow (0.075% for FY2024 based on the GOS\u2019s current revenue expenditure forecast for FY2021).24 \nThe project\u2019s budgetary impact on the SELD\u2019s current revenue expenditures and the Universities \nand Boards Department would also be small, making this a fiscally sustainable investment. \n \nC. \n \n33. \nFinancial management and procurement risk assessments were carried out. Key findings \nare  in  the  risk  assessment  and  risk  management  plan. 25 Although  the  SELD  complies  with \ngovernment  regulations,  its  procurement  systems  are  weak  due  to  limited  capacity,  weak \nprocesses and administration, and inadequate anticorruption measures. Procurement risk is high. \nFinancial  management  staff  are  qualified,  experienced,  and  familiar  with  development  partner \nfinancial management procedures. There is a well-functioning financial management information \nsystem, and external audit by the Auditor General of Pakistan. The main weakness is the lack of \nfamiliarity  with  ADB  procedures,  which  will  be  addressed  through  staff  training.  Financial \nmanagement risk is moderate. Governance risk is moderate to substantial. To address these, the \nSELD  will  establish  a  dedicated  independent  PIU  with  qualified  procurement  and  financial \nmanagement staff. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and \ndiscussed with the GOS and the SELD. The policy requirements and supplementary measures \nare described in the PAM (footnote 19). \n \nD. \n \n34. \nBy improving access and quality in Sindh secondary education, the project will help lift the \nincomes of those who obtain higher-quality secondary education.

The \nproject is classified gender equity theme, which requires the preparation of a gender action plan \n(GAP)  and  hiring  of  a  gender  specialist  to  assist  in  GAP  implementation  and  monitoring.27 A \ndetailed GAP has been prepared with measurable targets and indicators to ensure that women \nand  girls  benefit  substantially  from  project  investments.  Key  GAP  actions  include  ensuring               \n(i)  school  design  is  gender-responsive,  (ii)  barriers  to  school  enrollment  for  girls  are  reduced,        \n(iii) female participation in training is equitable, and (iv) the examination system is gender neutral. \n \nE. \n \n35. \ncategories are as follows.28 \n\nIn  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),  the  project\u2019s  safeguard \n\nSafeguards \n\nEnvironment (category B). As the location of subprojects will not be finalized until after \n36. \nthe project is approved by the ADB Board of Directors, an environmental assessment and review \nframework was prepared in coordination with the SELD, consistent with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy \nStatement  (2009).  The  framework  was  disclosed  on  ADB\u2019s  website  in  July  2018.  It  provides \nguidance  on  subproject  screening  and  categorization;  assessment  and  planning;  and  public \nconsultation,  disclosure,  and  a  grievance  redress  mechanism.  ADB  will  review  and  approve \nenvironmental assessment and environmental planning documents before construction begins. \nThe environmental impacts of subprojects will occur mostly during construction and are expected \nto  be  site-specific  and  unlikely  to  be  irreversible.  Adequate  mitigation  measures  will  be \nimplemented through  site-specific  environmental  management  plans.  The PIU\u2019s  environmental \nsafeguard capacity is low, so project consultants will train staff in environmental management. \nThe project will not finance potential subprojects located in sensitive environments. \n \n37. \nInvoluntary resettlement (category B). The secondary school blocks will be constructed \nin school  compounds  with available land.  However,  school  sites will  only  be finalized  after  the \nproject is approved by ADB, based on agreed criteria and following the conduct of due diligence. \nIt is uncertain whether there are third-party users of the land who may be affected. A resettlement \nframework  has  been  prepared. 29  School  sites  will  be  screened  and  assessed  following \npreparation  of  detailed  school  designs,  based  on  criteria  in  the  project\u2019s  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement framework. Upon finalization of the detailed school designs, if affected people are \nidentified, land acquisition and resettlement plans will be prepared, approved, and implemented \nprior  to  displacing  affected  people  and  commencing  works.  The  project  will  not  finance \nresettlement or land acquisition.  \n \nIndigenous peoples (category C).
