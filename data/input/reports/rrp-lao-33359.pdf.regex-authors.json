It is dominated \nby banks, most of which are state-owned. Until recently, the state- \nowned  commercial  banks  (SOCBs)  have  been  used  as \ninstruments of policy and state-owned enterprise (SOE) financing \nat  the  expense  of  their  commercial  orientation  and  financial \nstrength. The Agriculture Promotion Bank (APB) is still considered \na policy bank, although the Government\u2019s vision is to transform it \ninto a market-based rural finance institution. Branches of foreign \nbanks  in  Vientiane  maintain  limited  operations,  and  serve \npredominantly foreign clients. \n  In  addition  to  the  large  fiscal  costs,  and  associated \nmacroeconomic  risk,  the  legacy  of  state  ownership  has \ncontributed  to  a  governance  system  that  may  not  be  fully \ncompatible  with  sound  banking  practices.  The  unpredictable \ncharacter  of  the  commercial  system  suppresses  the \nentrepreneurial activity needed to achieve the higher growth path \nrequired to graduate from least-developed-country status by 2020.  \n  In a market oriented economy the financial sector is strategically \nimportant. The rationale for the Banking Sector Reform Program \n(BSRP) is therefore the need to open the sector to increased \nprivate participation through improved governance and incentives \nin banks, and a strengthened environment for the enforcement of \nloan contracts. The Program supports meaningful changes in the \nway the commercial system operates and addresses conditions to \nextend financial services to the large part of the population that \nhas no access to such services.  \n  The  BSRP  loan  is  embedded  in  a  broad  framework  of \nmacroeconomic, fiscal, and commercial reform supported by the \nInternational Monetary Fund (IMF) through its poverty reduction \nand growth facility (PRGF) approved in April 2001, and by the \nWorld Bank through its financial management adjustment credit \n(FMAC) approved in June 2002 \n   \nEnvironment  C  \nAssessment  The environmental implications are minimal. \n   ", "ii   \nObjectives and Scope  The objective is to support Government efforts to foster efficient \nfinancial  intermediation  and  ensure  a  sound  banking  system \ncapable of supporting growth and rural outreach. Specifically, the \nProgram will  \n(i)  support  sound  banking  through  improved  governance \npractices;  \n(ii)  mobilize the judiciary to use a strengthened legal system \nand the Bank of the Lao PDR (BOL) to use an effective \nprudential  regulation  system  to  bring  failed  borrowers, \nstrategic defaulters, and unsound banks to account; \n(iii)  foster a competitive, predictable commercial environment \nfor all banks; and \n(iv)  provide the opportunity for a range of institutional models \nand methodologies for extending financial sector outreach. \n \n  To achieve this objective, the BSRP loan will support programs in \nfive interdependent areas:  \n(i)  restructuring  the  banking  sector  through  reducing  the \nnumber of SOCBs, increasing competition, and operational \nrestructuring of the remaining SOCBs; \n(ii)  improving  the  legal  framework  and  judicial  capacity  to \nsupport loan collection and collateral enforcement; \n(iii)  facilitating access to finance by small- and medium-sized \nenterprises (SMEs) through a secured transactions system \nand improved financial disclosure; \n(iv)  developing  a  policy  and  institutional  environment \nconducive to rural and micro finance; and \n(v)  undertaking strategic planning for the period (2006\u20132010) \nbeyond the current restructuring program. \n \nFinancing Plan  The Government has requested the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) to provide a loan of $15 million from ADB\u2019s Special Funds \nresources. This amount was determined through ADB\u2019s continued \ndialogue with the Government. It takes into account the depth and \nscope of the proposed policy reforms, and the estimated short-  \nand medium-term adjustment costs associated with adopting the \npolicy matrix. The Borrower will be the Lao PDR. The loan will \nhave a repayment period of 24 years, including a grace period of \n8 years. An interest rate of 1% per annum will be charged during \nthe grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter. The loan is \nexpected to be utilized over 48 months from loan effectiveness. \nThe proceeds may be used to finance eligible imports for the \nperiod 180 days before loan effectiveness. ", "  iii \nProgram Period and  It is proposed that the loan consist of three tranches that will be \nTranching  disbursed when ADB is assured that the conditions for release are \nsatisfied. The first tranche of $5 million will be made available \nfollowing  loan  effectiveness.  It  is  envisaged  that  the  second \ntranche of $5 million will be disbursed within 19 months after the \nfirst tranche release, subject to the Government's compliance with \nconditions.  The  third  tranche  of  $5  million  is  expected  to  be \ndisbursed within 15 months after the second tranche release, \nsubject to the Government's compliance with conditions. ADB and \nthe Government will review progress in implementing specified \npolicy actions set out in the policy matrix 3 months before the \nscheduled tranche release. \n   \nExecuting Agency  The Executing Agency will be the BOL, which will have overall \nresponsibility  for  ensuring  timely program implementation and \nreporting  to  ADB  on  progress  made,  problems  encountered, \nremedial actions taken during the previous quarter, and proposed \nprogram activities during the next quarter. Implementing agencies \nwill include BOL, Ministry of Finance (MOF), Ministry of Justice \n(MOJ), and the SOCBs, which will have responsibility for effective \nday-to-day  implementation  of  their  components  under  the \nProgram.  \n   \nImplementation  The  Executing  Agency  will  establish  a  bank  restructuring \nArrangements  implementation committee (BRIC), chaired by the deputy governor \nof  BOL.  The  BRIC  will  be  empowered  to  oversee  program \nimplementation  and  ensure  that  the  proposed  reforms  are \nundertaken in accordance with the agreed-upon timetable. The \nmembers will initially include the chairmen of the four committees \nthat designed the program (Bank Restructuring Committee, NPL \nCommittee,  Human  Resource  Committee,  and  the  Information \nTechnology Committee). \n   \n  The  BRIC  will  coordinate  closely  with  (i)  the  implementing \nagencies; (ii) other key departments in BOL, such as the Bank \nand Financial Supervision Department (BFSD) and Internal Audit; \n(iii) other ministries with interest in the BSRP, such as Ministry of \nLabor and Social Welfare and Ministry of Security; and (iv) other \nrelevant TA steering and policy committees, particularly the Rural \nand  Micro  Finance  Committee  and  the  prospective  program \nmanagement  unit  of  the  European  Union  (EU)  Bank  Training \nProject. The BRIC will meet at least quarterly to review progress \nreports and guide program implementation. \n   ", "iv   \nProcurement  The loan will finance the full foreign exchange costs, excluding \nlocal duties and taxes, of imports procured in and from ADB\u2019s \nmember countries, other than those specified in ADB\u2019s list of \nineligible  items  and  items  financed  by  other  multilateral  and \nbilateral official sources. Items eligible under ADB loan will be \nprocured through normal commercial practices for procurement by \nthe  private  sector  or  standard  Government  procedures  for \nprocurement by the public sector that are acceptable to ADB. In \nthe case of goods commonly traded on international commodity \nmarkets, procurement will follow procedures appropriate to the \ntrade and acceptable to ADB.  \n   \nCounterpart Funds  The Government will use counterpart funds to finance the local \ncurrency costs of implementing the Program and other activities \nconsistent with the objectives of the Program.   \n   \nProgram Risks  As  the  Program  is  based  on  the  assumption  of  a  stable \nmacroeconomic environment, any violation of this could adversely \naffect  the  financial  performance  of  the  SOCBs.  The \nmacroeconomic risk is being minimized through the monitored \nfiscal and monetary framework under the IMF\u2019s PRGF, attention \nto better financial reporting and limits to credit expansion under \nthe World Bank\u2019s FMAC, and the emphasis on sound banking, \nfinancial  disclosure,  and  performance  monitoring  under  the \nproposed BSRP. \n \n  The second risk concerns the ability and will of the Government to \nimplement  the  broad  reform  program  and  the  possibility  that \nprovincial authorities may be opposed to reform. The risk is being \nmitigated by a continuation of the year-long program of ownership \nbuilding;  strong  aid  coordination;  a  front-loaded,  performance-\nbased  program  design;  and  flexible  program  parameters. \nGovernment commitment to carry out and sustain the range of \nreforms under the Program is demonstrated by up-front actions of \nmerit already taken.  \n \n  The third risk is that the proposed reforms will be undertaken by \nministries, officials, and bankers that are relatively inexperienced \nand lacking in technical knowledge. This risk is addressed through \na  significant  amount  of  TA  in  the  form  of  resident  advisors, \ncoupled  with  formalized  training  courses  and  basic  training  in \nstandardized loan documents and required financial statements. \nIn addition to resident international banking advisors (IBAs) inside \nthe SOCBs, there will be resident advisors to the BRIC and to the \njudiciary.  The  deployment  of  multiple  advisors  to  help \nimplementation will be balanced with country ownership concerns \nthrough care in designing terms of reference, which maintains \nappropriate accountability. \n   \n ", "  v\n  The fourth risk is that restructuring the SOCBs may result in \nredundancies and this could lead to resentment and  grassroots \nresistance, especially in the provincial branches. Consultation and \nawareness  building  have  begun  and  will  continue  throughout \nimplementation.  The  Government,  in  consultation  with  the \nstakeholders and as agreed upon with ADB, has also committed \nthat  mitigation  measures  will  be  an  integral  part  of  the \nrestructuring  program,  should  there  be  adverse  effects  on \nvulnerable SOCB staff.  \nTechnical Assistance   \nThe Technical  The objective of the technical assistance (TA) grant is to support \nAssistance Grant  the Government\u2019s efforts to implement the reform program. The \ngoal  of  the  TA  is  effective  banking  sector  restructuring, \nnonperforming loan (NPL) resolution and legal/judicial capacity \nbuilding to promote financial sector development. The TA aims to:  \n(i)  strengthen Government oversight of bank restructuring; \n(ii)  assist  SOCBs  develop  and  implement  NPL  resolution \nstrategies; \n(iii)  establish  the  commercial  division  of  the  court  and \nstrengthen  the  legislative  framework  for  commercial \ntransactions; and \n(iv)  assist  in  refining,  disseminating  the  banking  legislative \nframework and standardizing loan documentation.   \nConsulting services of 53 person-months\u201323 international and 30 \ndomestic consultants\u2013will be required. The TA grant consists of \n$900,000: $750,000 from ADB TA Special Fund and $150,000 \nfrom the Canadian Governance Fund to finance judicial training.  \n   \nRelated Technical  A complementary TA loan of $4 million is being processed in \nAssistance   parallel to finance two resident IBAs in each of the two SOCBs for \n3 years, and to upgrade information technology for the banks to \n \nsupport the governance improvements, cessation of loss making \nactivities and operational efficiency gains.  \nRural finance activities are being supported by a Rural and Micro \nFinance cluster TA and the secured transactions system will be \nsupported by a private sector development advisory TA in 2003. ", "vii \n \n \n ", "     \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \nprogram loan to the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) for the Banking Sector \nReform Program (BSRP). The report also describes proposed technical assistance (TA) for \nBanking Sector Reform and Judicial Strengthening, and if the Board approves the proposed \nloan, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, will approve the TA. \n \nII.  THE MACROECONOMIC CONTEXT \n2.  The country\u2019s transition to a market-oriented economy was initiated in 1986 with the \nadoption of the New Economic Mechanism. During the initial period, the Government pursued a \nnumber of important reforms, most notably redefining and limiting the role of the state in the \nallocation of resources. Key actions included price and trade liberalization, introduction of \nbusiness legislation, the return of agriculture production to private households, privatization of \nstate-owned  enterprises  (SOEs),  and  establishment  of  a  two-tiered  banking  system.  The \ntransition had a strong impact on the economy and growth averaged 6-7% during the period.  \n \n3.  Reform momentum weakened during the middle of the 1990s. Beginning in 1997, on the \nheels of the Asian crisis, the Government pursued an expansionary fiscal policy financed by \ncentral bank credit. Given the already high degree of currency substitution, inflation increased to \n128.4%  in  1999  and  the  kip  depreciated  sharply.  Losses  accumulated  in  the  banks  and \nenterprises, as unhedged firms and banks were unable to offset the detrimental effect of \ninflation and currency depreciation. Recognizing the severe cost of high inflation, the authorities \nembarked on a stabilization program in mid-1999 and, over the next 18 months, reestablished a \nstable macroeconomic framework. \n \n4.  Since  2000,  the  Government\u2019s  macroeconomic  management  has  been  successful, \nalthough the tenuous fiscal situation and persistent dollarization have kept the macroeconomic \nstability  fragile.  In  April  2001,  the  International  Monetary  Fund  (IMF)  approved  a  3-year \narrangement  under  the  poverty  reduction  and  growth  facility  (PRGF).  Macroeconomic \nperformance in the first year of the PRGF was generally satisfactory, as inflation remained at \naround 7% and the economy expanded at 5.2% despite a slowdown in the regional economy. \nPreliminary evidence suggests buoyant economic activity in the first half of 2002, contained \ninflation at 7.5%, and a relatively stable exchange rate.  \n \n5.  The linkage between macroeconomic stability and bank soundness is particularly acute \nin the Lao PDR. The financial structure of the state-owned commercial banks (SOCBs) is highly \nsensitive to price and exchange rate movements due to large exposure in foreign currency \nassets and growing foreign currency liabilities. Financial sector restructuring, in concert with \nother sectoral reforms, is therefore needed to prevent the economy from entering nito the \nvicious circle of bank losses exacerbating macroeconomic instability, which, in turn, will create \nfurther  losses  and  greater  macroeconomic  instability.  The  fragile  macrostability  and  the \nvulnerability of bank soundness to renewed price and exchange rate pressures make the task \nurgent. \n \n6.  The  Government  recognizes  that  sustaining  the  recent  success  in  stabilizing  the \neconomy  depends  on  continued  diligence  in  macroeconomic  management  and  deepening \nstructural reforms to help propel the economy to a higher growth path. Moreover, for wider \npoverty  reduction,  increased  growth  will  have  to  be  complemented  with  increased  fiscal \nresources to enable Government expenditure to address activities with high social return. Fiscal \npressure brought on by large losses in the financial sector restricts the Government in fulfilling \nits social sector mandate. \n ", "2   \n7.  Looking to the future, the Government and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) signed a \npoverty reduction partnership agreement (PRPA) on 28 September 2001 that lays out a short- \nmedium- and long-term vision for reducing poverty in the Lao PDR. The PRPA signals ADB\u2019s \nsupport for the Government program to develop the economy and assistance to enable the \ncountry to graduate from least developed status by 2020. The key pillars include sustained \nmacroeconomic  stability,  increased  growth  through  an  improved  commercial  environment, \ndevelopment  of  a  financial  system  that  supports  private  sector  growth,  considerable \nimprovement in terms of outreach, and promotion of good credit culture. As an integral part of \nthe PRPA and to complement the fiscal, monetary, and structural efforts under the IMF PRGF \nand World Bank financial management adjustment credit (FMAC),1 activities targeted under the \nBSRP loan form pillars for a privately driven commercial system that is needed to support new \nproductive activities and increased access to financial services.  \n \nIII.  THE SECTOR \nA.  Sector Description and Performance \n1.  Overview \n8.  The financial sector remains small relative to other countries and the services provided \nare limited. Financial services reach only a small part of the population. The ratio of broad \nmoney to GNP increased from 7.5% in 1990 to around 20% today. The sector is dominated by \nbanks and there is only one insurance company. There are no leasing companies, and no other \nnon bank financial institutions. Financial services reach only a small part of the population and \nthe services delivered, with a few exceptions, are not being provided on a sustainable or \nefficient basis.  \n \n9.  Private sector development (PSD) objectives started with efforts to privatize, lease and \nliquidate a large number of SOEs; establish a legal basis for private production; and build legal \nand judicial institutions. However, efforts in this area slowed during the mid-1990s. Similar to \nhistorical trends in other countries, there is currently in the Lao PDR a pervasive financial \nindiscipline as many commercial principles taken for granted in post-transition economies are \nonly now being considered as desirable and inalienable. New laws and regulatory frameworks \nare not well understood and are inconsistently enforced, resulting in a poorly defined and \nopaque legal framework for business. As a result, rule-based discipline in the economy is weak, \nleading to weak borrowers and weak banks. \n \n2.  Commercial Banking \n10.  The Lao PDR banking sector is small at around $400 million2 in total assets. It employs \naround 1,500 people and is dominated by one relatively large and two smaller SOCBs, which \naccount for 70% of the total gross assets of the banking system.3 Branches of several foreign \nbanks  started  operating  in  Vientiane  in  the  early  1990s,  but  deficiencies  in  the  banking \nenvironment, particularly the legal framework, and limitations on their activities have contained \ntheir contribution to the domestic economy.4  \n \n                                                 \n1 The preparation and design of the BSRP loan was coordinated with the PRGF presented to the IMF Board on April \n2001 and the FMAC presented to the World Bank Board in June 2002. \n2  Banque pour le Commerce Exterieur (BCEL) is the former foreign trade bank (accounting for 50% of total gross \nbanking assets). Lane Xang Bank (LXB) and Lao May Bank (LMB) account for about 20% of total banking assets. \n3 In comparison, the Vietnamese banking sector has $11.7 billion, while Cambodia has $245 million of assets in its \nrudimentary banking sector. \n4  There is a joint-venture (Lao-Viet) and a private domestically owned bank (Vientiane Bank) but both are very small. ", "  3   \n11.  The current state-owned banking sector was initiated in the Lao PDR in March 1988 with \nDecree no. 11 and finalized with the promulgation of the Central Bank Law in 1990 which \nestablished a two-tiered system. Three commercial banks were established immediately on a \nregional basis, followed by four more in 1990 and 1991 to provide banking services to the \nprovinces. The establishment of the banks came with portfolios of bad assets built up by the old \nState Bank of Lao. Privatization and liquidation of many SOEs in the early 1990s further eroded \nthe asset quality of the balance sheet. Shortly after issuing the first set of banking regulations5 \nthrough Decree 3, the Government capitalized the banks in mid-1993, bringing them to sound \nlevels of capital adequacy with bond and cash injections.  \n \n12.  SOCB performance since the first capitalization in 1993 has generally fallen short of \nexpectations. In 1999, the Government merged six small unsustainable regional and provincial \nbanks into two new SOCBs (LXB and LMB), and planned to clean up pre-2000 nonperforming \nloans  (NPLs)  for  them  and  for  BCEL  in  exchange  for  governance  improvements  and \nmeasurable operational change. In 2000 and 2001 however, the three SOCBs continued to \ngenerate losses. The losses were caused by (i) continuation of asset deterioration due to \ncontinued  credit  indiscipline  of  banks  and  borrowers;  (ii)  large  revaluation  losses  due  to \ncurrency devaluation effects on unhedged balance sheets, resulting from poor lending practices \nin the past and the legacy of macroinstability; and (iii) high noninterest expenses for staff, \nbranches, and capital.  \n \n13.  The  principal  issues  facing  the  SOCBs  today  therefore  have  both  stock  and  flow \ndimensions. The legacy of foreign currency loans to unhedged customers, directed lending for \nnoncommercial activities, loans to SOEs, and nonpayment of central and provincial authorities \nto bank customers for government contract work left a $50 million deficit in the balance sheets. \nOn the flow side, despite some recent success in credit policies, NPL collection, and corporate \nmanagement, the improvements have not been sufficiently deep nor have they been sustained \nlong enough to meet the formidable challenge of a significant change in financial performance. \n \n14.  SOCBs continue to suffer from a wide range of fundamental institutional weaknesses. \nInternal factors range from limited human resource capacity, inadequate information technology, \noverstaffing,  inadequate  attention  to  prudent  risk  management,  to  the  lack  of  effective \ngovernance structures\u2013boards, committees, policies, and procedures. External factors that have \nlimited  improvements  on  the  SOCB  financial  position  include  debt  overhang  from \nmacroeconomic instability prior to 2000, deficiencies in the judicial and loan security system, a \nhistorical need to support government policy objectives and SOEs, and private sector borrowers \nwith limited capacity to present bankable projects. \n \n15.  The  Government  deemed  improvements  to  the  banking  environment  and  in  the \ninstitution\u2019s operations (governance improvements) to be prerequisites to reviving the banks\u2019 \nbalance sheets. However, initiation of a comprehensive, front-loaded program of operational \nrestructuring recently took on a new urgency. Improved financial transparency in recent months \nindicated  an  unsustainable  growth  in  NPLs  since  2000\u2013particularly  in  one  bank\u2013and  a \nworrisome growth in assets of questionable quality in another, raising the specter of accelerated \nasset deterioration and a significant increase in restructuring cost. \n \n3.  Private Sector Provision of and Access to Bank Finance \n16.  The Government recognizes that inevitably the private sector has a major role to play in \nfuture development and that a sound banking system is essential if the private sector is to meet \nits full potential. Currently, private sector firms are small\u2013over 90% are owner-operated\u2013and \n                                                 \n5 The regulation (i) defined the criteria for establishing a commercial bank, (ii) defined the business of a commercial \nbank, (iii) defined the rules for the boards of directors, and (iv) gave BOL oversight responsibility.  ", "4   \nonly  a  small  proportion  of  small-  and  medium-sized  enterprises  (SMEs)  have  access  to \ncommercial bank financial services. Historically, private enterprises, particularly SMEs, have \nbeen crowded out of SOCB financing by larger firms. Private firms also have difficulty obtaining \nfinancing from the private banks in Vientiane because of an inadequate system for collateral \nvaluation and enforcement, along with a general lack of capacity to prepare basic financial \nstatements and present bankable projects.  \n \n17.  In order to address these problems, a secured transactions law was introduced in 1996 \nand was made operational through an implementing decree in 2000. However, the system has \nnot become functional despite the legal requirements that all bank loans must be securitized. \nThree problems exist: (i) deficiencies in the original law and implementing decree impede their \napplication and enforcement, (ii) lack of functioning computerized secured transactions registry, \nand (iii) limited knowledge and training for participants under the new system. Similarly, despite \na law requiring that all medium-size companies prepare audited financial statement and despite \ncredit policies and prudential regulations requiring borrower\u2019s financial information as the basis \nfor  a  loan  or  a  restructuring,  preparation  of  financial  statements  by  banks  borrowers  is \npractically nonexistent.  \n \n4.  Micro and Rural Finance \n18.  The Lao PDR remains largely agricultural and rural. Eighty-five percent of the workforce \nis engaged in agriculture, which generates over half of the gross domestic product (GDP) and, \n90% of the poor live in rural areas. However, the financial sector in the Lao PDR has, to date, \nachieved a low level of outreach in rural areas. Surveys estimate that only 11% of rural people \nhave the ability to access formal financial institutions, and only 1% currently save in the banking \nsector.   \n \n19.  Government policies and institutional weaknesses also contribute to the low outreach. \nCurrent policy to support access to rural finance has been implemented primarily by the \nAgriculture Promotion Bank (APB). The government subsidizes APB's operations and controls \nAPB\u2019s interest rates. In addition, APB\u2019s lending has been largely directed by the Government, \nwhich has contributed to operating losses and a high level of problem loans. The actions distort \nAPB\u2019s service provision to clients and result in misallocation of resources, crowding out of \ncommercial finance by microfinance institutions (MFIs) and other banks, and the need for the \nGovernment to periodically recapitalize APB. Furthermore, current restrictions on interest rates \nand private ownership limit the development of MFIs, hence hindering the development of a \ncompetitive  marketplace.  Institutionally,  APB  carries  out  a  multitude  of  financial  and  non-\nfinancial activities, reflecting its mixed mandate as a financial institution and development organ \nof  the  state.  As  a  result,  its  operations  are  inefficient,  and  management  autonomy  and \nresponsibility are limited. Finally, prior to 2002, APB had never been audited and it has never \npublished its financial statements, making its financial situation (and, therefore, costs to the \nbudget) unclear to stakeholders. \n \n20.  Given the difficult operating environment for rural finance, the Government envisions a \nvariety of financial service models to support the development of the rural sector. Though still \nunderdeveloped,6 pilot projects are beginning to demonstrate the validity of microfinance in the \nLao PDR. To date, however, the growth and sustainability of these pilots have been hindered by \nlack of clarity (i) in the legal and regulatory environment for rural and micro finance,7 and (ii) \nregarding the appropriate role of APB in the future development of the sector. \n                                                 \n6 Currently, the three largest MFIs collectively reach about 10,000 clients, and an estimated 1,600 village revolving \nfunds serve about 8,000 active borrowers. Few of these are operating on a sustainable basis because of \noperational inefficiencies and caps on the interest rates that they charge.   \n7 There are currently no regulations for MFIs other than the credit cooperative regulations and APB's own credit union \nregulations.  ", "  5   \n \nB.  Issues and Opportunities \n21.  The Government has adopted a goal of achieving sustained poverty reduction and \ngraduating from least developed country status by 2020. This will require (i) continued price and \ncurrency stability, (ii) the development of a sound and efficient financial system, and (iii) a robust \nprivate sector operating by commercial rules and reaping commercial rewards. \n \n22.  These goals were stated objectives of previous interventions and remain priorities of the \nGovernment\u2019s strategy, as they continue to be key prerequisites to sustained growth and \npoverty reduction. The BSRP loan builds on these past interventions by (i) carrying forward to \nthe next stage areas initiated under previous financial sector operations, such as strengthening \nthe legal and judicial system to support commercial transactions; (ii) revising activities that were \nless successful but even more urgent than before, such as restructuring the SOCBs; and (iii) \nsupporting reforms in new strategically important areas, such as rural and micro finance. \n \n23.  ADB\u2019s support for the Lao PDR\u2019s financial system started at the beginning of the \ntransition.  The  first  program  loan8  supported  the  formulation  of  the  legal,  regulatory,  and \ninstitutional framework for a two-tiered banking system, monetary management, and private \nsector development. The second program loan9 furthered the initiatives covering monetary \nmanagement, and financial and legal infrastructure, and extended the financial infrastructure to \nbanking by strengthening prudential supervision and borrower credit information.  \n \n24.  These programs were successful in (i) helping the Government manage the transition \nfrom the monobank directing credit by administrative order to the mixed system of today; (ii) \nbuilding the basic legal, financial, and institutional infrastructure needed to operate monetary \npolicy through a financial system; (iii) creating greater transparency and directing attention to \nthe financial accountability of institutions; and (iv) improving the skill sets of bankers with \nextensive technical assistance in credit risk management, financial management and strategic \nplanning. \n \n25.  Both programs also sought to build sound state-owned banks by cleaning up their NPL-\nimpaired balance sheets,10 but subsequent performance fell short of expectations.11 Although \nthese programs were successful in many respects, they had limited success in improving \ngovernance arrangements both within and without the SOCBs. In addition to detrimental moral \nhazard issues arising from the approach to balance sheet restructuring, insufficient attention \nwas given to fundamental operational change and to introducing incentives regimes inside the \nbanks. The inability of the judicial and prudential regulatory systems to enforce discipline and \nensure soundness12 weakened program outcomes. \n \n26.  Because of the limited operational change and the low degree of financial discipline \nthroughout the economy, SOCBs have chronically underperformed and the banking system \nrequires capital support despite capitalization less than 10 years earlier. The current financial \n                                                 \n8 ADB. 1990.

", "6   \nposition and direction of the SOCBs pose a macroeconomic threat, as restructuring costs are \nrising at more than 1% of GDP every 2 years. Though possibilities for short-run turnaround is \nlimited  given  the  entrenched  NPLs  and the highly exposed foreign exchange position, the \nmacroeconomic situation still requires urgent attention to address the long-run health of the \nbanks.  \n \n27.  Equally importantly, the continuation of NPLs signals that substantial improvement in \nfinancial discipline is required to enable the banking sector to reorient itself and provide the \nconditions to attract private sector participation. Global experience shows that a sudden move \ntoward private ownership of banks immediately following a lengthy period of state ownership \ncould be risky since the level of institutional development and sophistication in the banking \nenvironment  would  be  insufficient  to  attract  foreign  banks  and  other  reputable  domestic \ninvestors.13 Thus, simultaneously increasing private bank participation, preparing SOCBs for \npotential investment and addressing weaknesses in the incentive system would seem to be \nmost prudent strategy. \n \n28.  Given the strategic importance of the financial sector, the rationale of the Program is \nbased  on  a  need  to  sustain  the  hard-earned  macroeconomic  stability  while  improving  a \ncommercial incentives regime for banking, strengthening the enabling environment, particularly \nin the area of loan contract enforcement, and opening the commercial market to increased \nprivate participation. At the same time, the lack of access of a large part of the population to \nfinancial services makes it imperative to improve the sustainable outreach of the financial \nsector. The recently enhanced Government awareness of the role of the financial sector in \noverall macroeconomic stability and growth provides an opportunity to foster meaningful change \nin the daily operations of the commercial system. \n \n29.  To capture this opportunity, the BSRP builds on the successes of previous interventions \nwhile incorporating lessons learned from a decade of assistance to the Lao PDR. Such lessons \ninclude: (i) the reform  must  be  owned  and  implemented  by  the  Government;  (ii)  strong \ncoordination among all aid agencies from design through implementation allows a unified \ndialogue  and  supports  Government  ownership;  (iii)  moral  hazard  is  minimized  only  if \nfundamental operational changes precede financial restructuring; (iv) in the absence of market-\nbased  corporate  governance,  operational  restructuring  requires  performance  incentives \n(rewards and penalties) and a focus on outcomes as success indicators; (v) TA should be \ndeployed alongside a set of policy actions as mutually reinforcing activities; and (vi) SOCB \nrestructuring should be seen as an opportunity to make other parts of the commercial system \noperate. \n \n30.  The current reform effort embodies a strong sense of Government ownership. A high-\nlevel policy workshop in February 2001 was the culmination of a Bank of the Lao PDR (BOL)-\nled in-depth review (Supplementary Appendix A)14 and policy dialogue on the state of the \nfinancial and banking sector in the Lao PDR. The workshop then initiated a year-long series of \nopen, inclusive workshops to build consensus, knowledge, and capacity to design the bank \nreform program. The result is a multiyear, multisector, Lao-owned reform program that views \noutcomes, not processes, as the objective. \n \n31.  In terms of aid coordination, the strategic importance of the financial sector to the future \ngrowth of the Lao PDR economy is evident through the wide interest and support from the aid \ncommunity. The Government\u2019s consensus-building process involved extensive consultations \nwith the aid community and resulted in a program that actively promotes the deployment of aid \nagency programs in an integrated and mutually reinforcing way. In particular, the current reform \n                                                 \n13 The World Bank, 2001 Finance for Growth: Policy Choices in a Volatile World, Oxford University Press, pp137-138. \n14 Bank of Lao PDR, ADB, and the World Bank. 2002. Lao PDR: Financial Sector Note. ", "  7   \nprogram is being supported by a series of interventions from the three international financial \ninstitutions  (IFIs)  around  a  common  policy  matrix.  The  IMF  PRGF  provides  the  overall \nmacroeconomic framework, monitors structural benchmarks, and identifies ADB and the World \nBank as assisting the Government in designing and implementing key structural reforms for the \nbanking  and  enterprise  sectors.15  The  World  Bank  FMAC  lays  the  foundation  for  bank \nrestructuring by focusing on (i) greater transparency and improved reporting; (ii) autonomy of \nthe management in appointing the SOCB management team, deciding on lending and setting \ninterest rates; (iii) limits on credit expansion; and (iv) addressing a major cause of NPLs through \nits SOE restructuring component. Assistance from other sources is also being deployed within \nthis common framework (Appendix 1).16 \n \n32.  The goal is to build financial discipline, a credit culture, and corporate governance as the \nfoundation  of  a  commercial  system.  Specifically,  BSRP  will  (i)  cause  banks  to  \u201cearn\u201d \nreplacement of pre-2000 loans as a reward for substantial operational changes that yield \nmeasurable  results;  (ii)  administer  incentives  through  performance  benchmarks  in  key \ngovernance areas with penalties for underperformance; (iii) improve the effectiveness of human \nresource capacity building by deploying formal training together with on-the-job training by the \ninternational banking advisors (IBAs); (iv) through the NPL resolution process, force NPL cases \nthrough the court system to foster a demand for judicial strengthening and an enforcement \nprogram; (v) use the experience and scale economies generated by SOCB restructuring to \nassist in APB restructuring in the later phases of the program; and (vi) through good credit \npolicies, cause private enterprises to prepare financial statements and business plans, thereby \ncreating a demand for accounting and other business services. \n \nIV.  THE PROPOSED PROGRAM  \nA.  Objectives and Scope \n33.  The objective of the Program is to support Government efforts to foster efficient financial \nintermediation and ensure a sound banking system capable of supporting economic growth and \nextending  rural  outreach.  The  objective  will  be  achieved  through  an  improved  operating \nenvironment for the banking sector, the immediate application of commercial principles in SOCB \noperations, and increased diversity in forms of rural financing, as described in the Government\u2019s \ndevelopment policy letter (Appendix 2).  \n \n34.  The BSRP loan will support initiatives in four specific areas: (i) restructuring the banking \nsector, including reducing the number of SOCBs, improving the commercial environment for all \nsound financial institutions and carrying out an extensive program of operational reform of the \nremaining SOCBs involving shrinking the balance sheets and aggressive NPL collection; (ii) \nimproving the legal framework for loan collection and collateral enforcement; (iii) improving the \nsecured transactions system, and better financial disclosure; and (iv) developing a market-\noriented policy and institutional environment conducive to rural and micro finance. As the \nProgram supports a major step toward future financial and private sector development, strategic \nplanning for the 2006-2010 post-restructuring period will be undertaken. \n \nB.  Policy Framework and Actions \n35.  The BSRP supports a framework designed after more than a year of preparation and \ndiscussions with the Government, IMF, and World Bank. It was developed with recognition of \nthe duration needed to strengthen implementation capacity, and the urgent need to achieve \n                                                 \n15 In addition, IMF is providing TA in support of the program\u2019s banking supervision goals. \n16 The Australian Agency for International Development financed audits of SOCBs covering the last 5 years and the \nEuropean Union (EU) is providing formal capacity building for SOCB and BOL staff. There is also strong \ncoordination with other aid agency projects in the banking sector.  ", "8   \nmeasurable and credible change in SOCBs\u2019 performance. As such, the policy matrix (Appendix \n3) reflects immediate change in the behavior of the SOCBs, coupled with medium-term reforms \nin the legal framework, the judiciary, banking supervision regulations, and rural finance. The \nprogram framework is in Appendix 4. \n  \n1.  Develop the Banking Sector  \n36.  Restructuring of the banking sector is a high priority in the Government\u2019s program for \nmacroeconomic stability and private sector development. The BSRP loan will support the \nGovernment\u2019s operational strategy of eliminating unsound parts of the  system. The strategy \nentails (i) structural changes in the sector; (ii) major operational change inside the SOCBs, \nincluding human resource development; (iii) a capital buildup program for the SOCBs centered \non intensive efforts at resolving current NPLs; and (iv) complementary measures in other parts \nof the environment to build a credit culture and give good borrowers access to finance. \n \na.  Prior Actions \n37.  Recognizing the urgency of banking reforms, the Government has already taken steps to \nprepare for restructuring of SOCB operations. Prior actions cover four areas: (i) improved \nfinancial  disclosure  and  restraints  on  credit  growth,  (ii)  improved  SOCB  governance  and \nautonomy, (iii) broad agreement on and commitment to principles and actions underlying SOCB \nrestructuring, and (iv) initiation of actions to restructure the SOCBs, including NPL collection \nactivities.  \n \n38.  To limit the moral hazard pressures before restructuring, a set of interim measures was \nput in place in 2001 and 2002 to (i) strictly apply BOL regulations on loan classification and \nprovisioning, (ii) ensure external audits are conducted and financial reporting to the supervisory \nauthorities is of high quality, (iii) prohibit lending to borrowers in default, and (iv) apply sector-\nwide ceilings on SOCB credit growth17 as well as bank-specific restrictions in the case of \nunsustainable asset quality.18 SOCB governance was strengthened through: (i) shareholder \ncommitment to the application of commercial principles to all lending; (ii) increased board and \nmanagement autonomy in key decision making areas including credit, branch management, and \ninterest rate determination; and (iii) limits on the credit authority of branches. \n \n39.  The Government completed preparations for a comprehensive restructuring program for \nthe operations and finances of SOCBs and APB.  In the case of SOCBs, restructuring principles \nwere defined in the memoranda of understanding for restructuring signed in March 2002, a \nbusiness plan framework agreed to in May 2002, culminating with detailed plans committed to in \nthe form of governance agreements. The principles embodied in these agreements include (i) a \nperformance-based  approach  to  restructuring  and  contingent  actions  in  the  case  of \nunderperformance; (ii) phased, conditional, and limited capital injections; and (iii) deployment of \nIBAs in the SOCBs.  \n \n40.  Implementing the Program for both the SOCBs and APB has begun. The plan for \nconsolidating the two smaller banks has started and the process of appointing new members of \nthe boards and management team of the two banks and their IBAs is at an advanced stage. The \nNPL resolution plan that began with a comprehensive review of each account has already \nyielded more than KN40 billion in collections by the three SOCBs this year. For APB, an \noperational diagnostic and the first ever external audit were completed, and a corporate vision \nto guide restructuring has been adopted by the APB board of directors. \n \n                                                 \n17 PRGF program requirements include yearly targets on SOCB credit expansion.  For 2002, the ceiling is 18%.  \n18  A FMAC condition prevents any expansion of the net risk portfolio if NPLs are greater than 15%.  ", "  9   \nb.  Structural Changes in the Banking Sector \n41.  To achieve structural change in the banking sector, the BSRP loan will support, in the \nfirst year, (i) a reduction in the number of SOCBs from three to two, (ii) a shrinking of the \nbalance sheets of the remaining SOCBs, and (iii) a more open environment conducive to sound \nbanking practices.  \n \n42.  Complementing this shrinkage of the unhealthy parts of the banking sector, the Program \nsupports the development of a forward-looking Government strategy to encourage a diverse, \ncompetitive, and commercially oriented financial sector. A key objective of the strategy will be to \nincrease the contribution of private banks to economic growth. Disciplined SOCBs, coupled with \nreforms in the judiciary and improved financial disclosure of borrowers, will encourage private \nsector banks to participate more in the Lao economy. In the meantime, the Government has \nprovided some relief from new capital requirements for foreign banks currently operating in the \nLao PDR and will introduce a new Decree Law on Commercial Banks, which will promote good \nbanking, good governance, and competitive environment. \n \nc.  Operational Restructuring of the Remaining SOCBs \n43.  Board  chairpersons  and  management  teams  will  take  the  major  responsibility  for \nmanaging the restructuring while at the same time absorbing intensive, on-the-job training. To \nguide the restructuring program, the Government and SOCBs are introducing: (i) \u201cgovernance \nagreements,\u201d which involve binding commitments on the part of the SOCBs, BOL, and Ministry \nof Finance (MOF) to carry out certain responsibilities in support of operational and financial \nrestructuring; and (ii) deploying IBAs inside the SOCBs.  \n \n44.  The  governance  agreement  defines  the  principles  and  responsibilities  behind  the \nrestructuring program, supported by specific performance targets, quantitative benchmarks, \nperformance  rating  methodology,  monitoring  and  reporting  arrangements,  and  contingent \nactions in case of underperformance. Compliance with the provisions will be gauged through \nquarterly reviews and biannual performance ratings, substantiated by yearly external audits. \nPerformance targets and, if necessary, corrective actions will be updated annually considering \nthe past year\u2019s performance and the following year\u2019s goals.  \n \n45.  To facilitate program implementation, IBAs working in the SOCBs will (i)  develop the \ninterim and comprehensive operational policies and procedures for approval by the SOCB \nboards; (ii) oversee improvements in systems and procedures; (iii) support the new approach to \ngovernance and help achieve the performance targets; (iv) provide direct advice on specific \nindividual transactions of material importance to the bank, focusing on large credit decisions; \nand  (v)  implement  cost-effective  right-sizing  activities.  To  ensure  efficient  and  timely \nrestructuring, the Government will borrow from ADB to finance for 3 years, two resident advisors \nin each SOCB. Outline terms of reference (TORs) for the IBAs are found as an annex to the \ngovernance agreements.  \n \n46.  The first year of operational restructuring will involve a comprehensive program to train \nthe new board of directors and management teams. Board and management committees will be \nestablished  and  governed  by  comprehensive  operational  policies  and  procedures  and \nsupported by better operations and reporting methodology. Decision-making will be transparent \nand based on commercial principles, and systems ensuring accurate recording of decision \nmaking and transactions will be installed. Branches will be streamlined and brought into a more \ncentralized  organizational  structure.  Compliance  will  focus  on  the  adoption  and  strict \nimplementation  of  new  sets  of  operational  policies  and  procedures.  The  initial  year\u2019s \nperformance will also be assessed through quantitative benchmarks on key elements such as ", "10   \nNPL ratios, collection performance, and foreign exchange exposure, with profitability and capital \nadequacy targets added in subsequent years.  \n \nd.  Human Resource Development \n47.  A particularly challenging constraint to financial sector development is the limited human \ncapacity and basic skills in banking and business. Therefore, a key aspect of the Program is the \nstrong emphasis on accelerated development of skills and capacity of the boards, management, \nand staff within the SOCBs. The human resource development program within the SOCBs will \ninclude (i) on-the-job training from working side by side with the IBAs to adopt, manage, and \nimplement  more  advanced  banking  procedures  and  techniques;  (ii)  formal  courses  and \nscholarships through the Program\u2019s potential association with a comprehensive European Union \n(EU) Bank Training Program19 and other training opportunities; (iii) a performance reward \nsystem, which views these prized scholarships as a key incentive for performance and for \nretaining the best performing employees in the sector; and (iv) a program to match existing staff \nskills with better defined job requirements.  Clients of and service providers to SOCBs will also \nbenefit from the training programs and workshops in specific areas such as preparing financial \nstatements and loan and security contracts, and managing problem loans. \n \ne.  Financial Restructuring of the SOCBs \n48.  The Program supports a phased and conditional buildup of capital in the two remaining \nSOCBs as a prerequisite to their long-term safety and soundness. Guided by past experience, \nthe Government is following a cautious approach to financial restructuring, recognizing that \nmoral hazard concerns must be addressed for the program to reach sound levels.20 The NPLs \nin the system will be resolved through a three-pronged approach to capital build-up: (i) SOCB \ncollection of NPLs made during 2000-02 (ii); Government compensation for NPLs which were \nmade prior to 2000; and (iii) additional, non-government capital to bring the capital adequacy \nrates to sound levels. Table 1 divides the NPL portfolio of the banks into two blocks of loans: \nNPLs made prior to21 and those made after 1 January 2000.  \n \n49.  The  most  urgent  task  is  for  SOCBs  to  actively  use  creditor\u2013debtor  negotiations, \nsupported by threat of legal action, to resolve the high level of NPLs that have built up in the \nsystem in the last 3 years \u2013 especially those originating from private sector enterprises with a \ncapacity to repay. These NPLs will be addressed through an aggressive program of case-by-\ncase resolution, focusing on cash collection and/or legal action. By encouraging SOCBs to \npursue borrowers in default, the Program not only supports improvement in the soundness of \nthe financial system. It will also create demand for a more reliable and active legal and judicial \nsystem for debt enforcement. A time-bound NPL resolution plan will include interim resolution \ntargets  of  resolving  2000-02  NPLs  by  mid-2005,  including  at  least  KN90  billion  in  cash \ncollections. To track progress and learn lessons from each NPL case, the following will be \nimplemented: (i) resolving private sector cases, through structured negotiation and/or judicial \naction; (ii) resolving NPLs from SOEs through the SOE restructuring process; and (iii) special \nhandling of accounts that became NPLs due to government arrears on public sector contracts.22 \n                                                 \n19 The proposed EU-funded (Euro-TAL) Bank Training Program will design and conduct an extensive in-house \ntraining program targeted at SOCB management and functional departments over a period of 24 months beginning \nin the first quarter of 2003. The training will focus on management training, accounting, some finance skills, and \nNPL resolution.  \n20 For example, the possibility is that a balance sheet cleanup could create the perception of releasing banks and \nborrowers from their past loan obligations. \n21 Almost 70% of the pre-2000 NPLs in the SOCBs are to SOEs and/or related to government contracts.  \n22\n One quarter of post-2000 NPLs originating from Government arrears to private sector contractors are to be settled \namong  the  borrower,  MOF,  and  the  SOCBs,  with  the  use  of  intricate  process  of  tripartite  discussion, \ndocumentation, and review.  ", "  11  \n \n50.  As most pre-2000 NPLs are loans to SOEs, and government arrears to contractors or \nare the result of directed lending, the Government will compensate the SOCBs for pre-2000 \nNPLs  through  a  conditional  and  phased  issuance  of  nontransferable,  nondiscountable \ngovernment securities to the banks, following third-party verification of the SOCBs meeting the \noperational performance targets. The bond injections will take place in four tranches of KN120 \nbillion each: at the beginning of the program (around March 2003), after the first midterm review \n(prior to October 2003), and after the two end-year performance reviews before May 2004 and \nMay 2005.23  \n \n51.  To eventually reach acceptable capital levels, the SOCBs will prepare, as part of the \nmedium-term strategy for the banking sector, a credible, time-bound capital buildup plan to \ncomply with BOL regulations on capital adequacy in a reasonable period. Given the difficulty of \naugmenting capital through growth and retained earnings, the buildup plan will need to include \nthe search for a strategic investor or other nonpublic sources of capital. \n \nf.  Prudential Supervision and Audits \n52.  Existing prudential supervisory regulations cover the key risk activities of the banks and \ncontain sufficient sanctions for imprudent banking activities. However, significant weaknesses in \nauthority  and  technical  capacity  prevent  the  Bank  and  Financial  Supervision  Department \n(BFSD)  of  BOL  from  effectively  implementing  such  regulations.  The  weaknesses  in  bank \nsupervision have been apparent in the application of a subset of prudential regulations which \nfocus on disclosure regulations for presenting financial accounts,24 and restricting commercial \nbank activity during the restructuring period.25  \n \n53.  Effective enforcement of prudential regulations will require application of good policies \nand procedures in the banks as well as vigorous verification of compliance by the supervisor. \nThe Program will contribute to the reporting and compliance effort from inside the SOCBs by \nstrengthening  internal  governance  procedures,  applying  formal  accounting  policies,  and \nintroducing better procedures through new information technology (IT) systems. The Program \nwill also activate BFSD\u2019s off-site systems and on-site inspections through (i) measures for \nprudential reporting incorporated into SOCB operational policies; (ii) effective off-site reports on \nfinancial soundness; and (iii) at least two yearly examinations of SOCBs to verify financial \nreports and qualitative performance targets.26 \n \n54.  External auditors are expected to provide independent assurance on the reliability of the \ninternal systems and the annual financial reports produced by each SOCB. BOL and MOF will \nensure that the SOCBs prepare annual accounts, that the accounts are in accordance with BOL \nAccounting Decree No. 03, and are audited by external auditors. MOF/BOL will require the \nauditors to give an opinion on the SOCBs\u2019 compliance with the operational policies and other \nactions/targets under the governance agreement. In addition to giving objective advice to MOF, \nBOL, SOCBs, and IFIs on compliance with the governance agreement, the auditors will help set \nthe program activities and performance targets for the coming year.  \n \n                                                 \n23\n In addition to NPLs made prior to 2000, the LMB deficiency is estimated at KN154 billion as part of the \nconsolidation plan of LXB and LMB. Since the last issuance is contingent on reconstituting the branch network and \nappointing the new branch managers, it will be released following the first half-year review.  \n24 Key  regulations  include  BOL/98,  which  defines  classification  methodology,  provisioning  requirements,  and \ntreatment of accrued interest, and BOL 3, which defines risk concentration limits.   \n25 Key restrictions include yearly ceilings in growth of net domestic assets of SOCBs (total SOCB credit), no net credit \ngrowth if NPLs are greater than 15%, and an embargo on capital expenditures, staff hiring, and dividends. \n26  Technical assistance to strengthen BFSD is being provided through an IMF advisor under a 2-year program that \nbegan in May 2002. ", "12   \n2.  Strengthen the Enabling Legal Environment and Judicial Oversight \n55.  The expected beneficial effect of restructuring the commercial banking sector will not be \nforthcoming without improvements in the legal and judicial system for enforcing loan and \nsecured property obligations. Therefore, as a key part of the objective to improve corporate \ngovernance and accountability in the financial system, the Program will strengthen the legal and \njudicial support for good banking through \n \ni.  strengthening  the  understanding  and  use  of  basic  concepts  behind  credit \ndiscipline  by:  (a)  introducing  standardized  loan-  and  security-related  legal \ndocumentation, and (b) conducting a credit awareness and judicial dissemination \ncampaign;  \n \nii.  supporting the establishment of a streamlined judicial approach to dealing with \nbad  debtors  by:  (a)  introducing  a  commercial  division  in  the  court  system \ndedicated and trained to rule on cases involving debtor/creditor disputes, with \nstreamlined rules and procedures for reaching and executing judgments; (b) \nstrengthening the enforcement framework and processes; and (c) designing a \nplan for resolving large debts of viable enterprises; and  \n \niii.  adopting anti-money laundering measures in recognition of their importance of \npromoting  good  governance  in  banking  to  benefit  Lao  PDR  and  the  global \ncommunity. \n \na.  Standardized Loan and Security Documentation  \n56.  Efficient/effective credit markets rely on information and certainty  about outcomes and \nare therefore dependent on a sound, consistent legal system. The Program will support legal \nand regulatory dissemination and active communication to help strengthen the credit culture \nthrough consultation among the commercial, judicial, and financial communities of the Lao PDR. \nThis  process  has  already  begun27  and  will  continue  throughout  program  implementation. \nSecond,  the  current  loan  and  security  documentation  used  by  the  SOCBs  is  deficient  in \nresponding to the needs of the borrowers and lenders. A review will be undertaken and a set of \nstandardized, simple loan and security contracts will be developed. Commercial judges, bank \nstaff,  private  legal  practitioners  and  potential  borrowers  will  be  trained  using  the  new \nstandardized documentation to ensure consistency in application and interpretation. \n \nb.  Commercial Division of Court and Enforcement   \n57.  Support for bank restructuring and better banking in the future means ensuring that the \ncourt system is properly equipped to deal with loan and secured property enforcement actions. \nCurrently  judges  in  the  Lao  PDR  have  limited  training  and  experience  in  commercial \ntransactions and associated areas such as debt enforcement arising from a loan transaction, \nenforcement of securities, and bankruptcy. The Program will assist in establishing a commercial \ndivision in the court system. The Ministry of Justice (MOJ) has nominated 18 judges for \nspecialized  training  in  commercial  transactions.  These  judges  will  later  adjudicate  all \ncommercial transaction cases. \n \n                                                 \n27 A high-level technical workshop, the first jointly hosted by BOL and MOJ, entitled Legal and Judicial Support for a \nStrong Banking Sector, was held on 20 June 2002 and disseminated the findings of the legal and judicial review \ncarried out under the project preparatory TA for the Financial Sector Development Program (PPTA 3737). The \nworkshop was followed by further dissemination of the findings and recommendations of the TA during the Annual \nMeeting of the Ministry of Justice, 2-4 July, 2002.   ", "  13  \n58.  A special set of rules of court to govern the conduct of commercial cases will be \ndeveloped to allow a streamlined process including, as a centerpiece, limiting the appeals for \ncommercial  transactions  to  the  People\u2019s  Supreme  Court.28  Mechanisms  for  enforcing \ncommercial transactions will be strengthened by giving the enforcement department/units more \npower and more effective staff to enforce the court decisions. The new judicial process will be \nreviewed regularly and revisions introduced as necessary. \n \n59.  As the credit culture improves from increased borrower awareness and a rising \u201ccredible \nthreat\u201d of legal action, a structured voluntary resolution system will (i) provide a less costly and \nmore appropriate venue for the lengthy negotiations that have hindered the effectiveness of \njudicial action, (ii) initiate enterprise restructuring for financially viable private enterprises, and \n(iii)  provide  the  authorities  with  real  case  lessons  regarding  systematic  causes  of  credit \nindiscipline. \n \nc.  Anti-Money Laundering  \n60.  BOL has sent representatives to observe meetings held by the Asia Pacific Group on \nMoney  Laundering.29  The  Government  recognizes  the  importance  of  combating  money \nlaundering,  and  there  is  a  rising  interest,  led  by  BOL  and  MOJ,  in  initiating  anti-money-\nlaundering measures in the Lao PDR.  Money laundering is a  major threat not only  to the \ndevelopment of a sound financial system, but also the well-being of the global society. Under \nthe 1988 Vienna Convention, all countries are required to set up comprehensive anti-money-\nlaundering regimes. Of critical importance to the regime are measures to (i) enhance awareness \non money laundering activities both within the Government and within private businesses, (ii) \nestablish  the  legal  and  regulatory  basis  for  combating  money  laundering,  and  (iii)  devise \nsystems for reporting suspicious transactions. \n \n61.  The BSRP will support the establishment of such a regime in the Lao PDR through \nissuance  of  anti-money  laundering  legislation,  creation  of  a  financial  intelligence  unit  as \nprovided for by the legislation on anti-money laundering, and seeking to enter into cross-border \ninformation- sharing agreements. \n \n3.  Enable the Private Sector to Access Credit \na.  Secured Transactions System \n62.  It is difficult to enforce security over land and other collateral under the current financial \nand legal system. Moreover, to encourage private sector access to finance, there needs to be a \ngreater  range  of  property  over  which  security  may  be  taken.  The  Program  will  assist  in \nintroducing amendments to the Secured Transaction Law, the Decree on Lease Financing, and \nother  related  laws  to  enhance  the  enforcement  of  security;  and  in  strengthening  direct \nenforcement process for lenders. To complement the legal changes, the effectiveness of the \nsecured  transactions  system  will  be  enhanced  by  establishing  a  computerized  secured \ntransaction registry, coordinated with the land and motor vehicle registries.  \n \n                                                 \n28 Currently, the practice of appealing to the public prosecutor and even the National Assembly is one of the main \nreasons final judgments take so long and enforcement actions are routinely delayed.  \n29 The Asia Pacific Group on Money Laundering was established in 1997 with the objective of facilitating the \nadoption, implementation, and enforcement of internationally accepted anti-money-laundering standards as set out \nin the 40 recommendations of the Financial Actions Task Force. Currently it has 22 members and ADB is an \nobserver. ", "14   \nb.  Financial Disclosure by Borrowers \n63.  One of the key causes of high NPLs in the SOCBs is lending without the requisite \nanalysis to determine the capability of borrowers to repay their debt from future cash flows. The \nProgram seeks to improve credit culture by ensuring that banks demand the provision of \nfinancial information as a condition for assessing all loan financing requests. Such a lending \npractice will be built into the credit policies and regulations and will be enforced through \nquarterly biannual reviews of the governance agreements. Guidance from BFSD will reinforce \nthe need for banks to require basic financial statements as part of their credit review process. \nThe resulting demand for financial reporting, coupled with training programs (envisioned under \nthe EU and other programs) to provide basic business skills, should encourage the growth of \nservice providers ready to support enterprises in preparing financial reports.  \n \n4.  Develop Rural Finance  \n64.  The Program will focus on an agenda of key policy regulatory and institutional measures \nfor developing a rural and micro finance system, including steps in realizing the Government\u2019s \ngoal of transforming APB into a market-oriented rural financial institution and opening micro \nfinance to a variety of models and methodologies. A cluster TA program consisting of six \nsubprojects, including diagnostics and reform of APB, has been under way since 2000 to assist \nthe Government in achieving this goal.30   \n \na.  APB: Policy, Regulatory, and Institutional Issues \n65.  Under the Program, APB will adopt a corporate vision that explicitly includes the goals of \nmarket orientation and will implement a phased operational and financial restructuring plan \nbased  on  good  governance  principles  to  achieve  that  vision.  The  specific  details  of  the \nrestructuring plan will be developed as an outcome of the ongoing diagnostic review and audit, \nand will build on the lessons from more than a year of implementation of SOCB restructuring.  \n \n66.  Given APB\u2019s \u201cdevelopment bank\u201d origins, the principal policy issues facing its reform \nplan include the treatment of noncommercial lending in the form of directed lending and interest \nrate subsidies. To enable APB to achieve its corporate vision, directed lending and interest rate \nsubsidies will be phased out of its operations and good governance policies will be applied. \nThrough the ongoing operational diagnostic, financial audit, and policy review, the Government \nwill be considering the precise timing of the phase-out and the use of alternative transparent \nmechanisms,  preferably  on-budget,  through  which  the  Government  can  channel  funds  for \nactivities currently financed by policy lending through APB.  \n \n67.  As  part  of  the  good  governance  approach  to  APB,  the  Program  will  support  a \ncontinuation of external audits for APB based on international banking standards and BOL 98 \nloan classification. As a medium-term objective, the Program will assist BOL, in consultation \nwith the IMF-supported program of bank supervision, to prepare and implement an appropriate \nregulatory  framework  for  prudential  supervision  of  APB  in  line  with  its  new  mandate  of \ncommercial operations and market orientation.  \n \nb.  Micro Finance: Policy, Regulatory, and Institutional Issues \n68.  The Government will adopt an overall vision for the sector and a strategy to support that \nvision. A rural and micro finance committee is preparing a vision statement for rural and micro \nfinance, and a time-bound action plan to remove the impediments to that vision as part of the \nGovernment\u2019s strategic planning for financial sector development. From this ongoing work, BOL \n                                                 \n30 ADB. 2000. Rural Finance Development (TA Cluster). Manila.  ", "  15  \nwill prepare, adopt, and implement an appropriate regulatory framework for microfinance credit \nunions and other models to encourage efficient intermediation of small savers\u2019 depositors. To \nfoster growth in the rural and micro finance sector, this framework will (i) allow a variety of MFI \nmodels, (ii) foster interest rate autonomy, and (iii) encourage private ownership.  \n \n69.  Improved  capacity  for  servicing  various  customer  types  and  diversified  lending \nmethodologies are also anticipated program outcomes. The dissemination of lessons from this \nexperience will help the Government, practitioners, potential investors, contributors and other \nstakeholders form best practice approaches to rural and micro finance. \n \n5.  Strategic Planning  \n70.  The Government priorities for the financial sector align with four of the seven focus areas \nin ADB\u2019s current country strategy for the Lao PDR: (i) governance and capacity building, (ii) \nrural development and market linkages, (iii) human resource development, and (iv) PSD. The \nstrategy was formulated for the phase of financial sector development being implemented with \nthe preparation of the Financial Sector Note, and continued through a participatory approach to \ndefining  the  Government\u2019s  vision  for  the  financial  sector.  Strategic  development  began  in \nearnest with the four building blocks underpinning the BSRP: (i) strategic framework for bank \nrestructuring,31 (ii) the awareness building project for rural and micro finance,32  (iii) the review of \nlegal and judicial enforcement, and (iv) review of policy-based impediments to PSD.33  The \nGovernment\u2019s next phase of strategy development (covering 2006\u20132010) for the sector will be \nsupported under the Program by adopting a financial sector strategy and action plan covering (i) \npost-restructuring banking; (ii) rural and micro finance based on the action plans currently under \ndevelopment; and (iii) other subsectors such as leasing, insurance, pensions, and private \nenterprise development. \n \nC.  Important Features \n1.  Governance Agreement and International Banking Advisors \n71.  In the absence of the incentives inherent in a competitive, market-oriented economy, \nbuilding corporate governance is a difficult challenge. Without the possibility of privatization in \nthe  near  term  to  strengthen  corporate  discipline,  the  Program  takes  the  middle  road  by \ncombining in-house advisors with an administratively applied performance framework. The \nProgram recognizes that the Lao PDR is a relatively young economy, retains a legacy of state \nownership  and  policy  direction  of  resources,  and  has  a  mixed  record  of  implementing \ncommercial principles in daily business. To support implementation of corporate discipline, \nindividual accountability, and the application of commercial law, the Program design utilizes a \ncombination of the governance agreement to provide a framework for performance-based \nincentives and on-site resident IBAs to ensure SOCB management capacity. The approach is \ndescribed in more detail in Supplementary Appendix B. \n \n72.  The governance agreements (Supplementary Appendix C) provides (i) a road map for \nrestructuring by defining financial and operational targets, (ii) a business plan for reaching those \ntargets, (iii) a performance measurement system, (iv) objective reviews by international auditors, \nand  (v)  a  BOL/MOF  requirement  to  impose  corrective  action  in  the  case  of  unfavorable \noutcomes. BOL will be responsible for ensuring that SOCBs achieve strict compliance with the \n                                                 \n31 ADB. 2000.

Diagnostics of the \nenvironment for loan collection and PSD were developed, disseminated, and reviewed through a series of \nworkshops in March, May, and June 2002. ", "16   \ngovernance agreements and will take the lead in applying sanctioned rewards or penalties. \nWorking inside the banks, two IBAs will carry out the sensitive role of coaching and teaching \ntheir Lao counterparts while introducing and overseeing the implementation of new governance \npolicies and procedures. The IBAs will consult BOL, MOF, and the IFIs regularly to solve the \nmany complex issues that will inevitably arise in this new and ambitious task. The Government \nrecognizes the importance and sensitivity of exposing international expertise to the SOCBs and \nhas requested a TA loan specifically for this purpose. The governance agreement and the IBAs\u2019 \nTOR are designed with flexibility to mitigate uncertainties inherent in this type of performance-\noriented reform program. As the performance of the SOCB management and the IBAs will be \nfrequently  evaluated  by  BOL,  MOF,  and  IFIs,  yearly  business  plans  and  recalibrated \nperformance targets will reflect lessons learned during the restructuring period. \n \n2.  Social Impact Issues   \n73.  An important concern of the Government and IFIs is the possible social impact on \nSOCBs staff during the restructuring process. BOL, in consultation with all stakeholders, is \npreparing a set of actions to alleviate tensions and anxieties among employees during the \nprocess of restructuring. With the assistance of international specialists, BOL and the SOCBs \nwill  introduce  (i)  a  methodology,  conditions,  and  timing  for  redeployment  and  possible \nretrenchment of SOCB staff; (ii) a consultation process; (ii) an assistance package for staff as \nprovided under the law; (iii) access to existing and future redeployment services; and (iv) \nmonitoring of retrenched workers. Although the SOCB restructuring may provide the first case of \nretrenching workers, SOE reform and other restructurings will pose similar challenges to the \nGovernment. Continued consultation with a wide range of stakeholders during program design, \ncoupled  with  the  delicate  balance  between  expediency  and  social  concerns  during \nimplementation will be the guiding principles of the cautious but proactive approach.  \n \nD.  Financing Plan  \n74.  The  Government  has  requested  a  loan  of  $15  million  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds \nresources to help finance the Program. The loan will have a repayment period of 24 years, \nincluding a grace period of 8 years. An interest rate of 1% per annum will be charged during the \ngrace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter. The total loan amount was determined through \nADB\u2019s continued dialogue with the Government. It takes into account the strategic importance of \ndeveloping the financial sector, the depth and scope of the proposed policy reforms, and the \nestimated short- and medium-term adjustment costs associated with adopting the policy matrix. \nThese costs are substantial (estimated at $36 million to $43 million equivalent) for the 36 \nmonths of program implementation and will comprise the following:  \n \n(i)  Higher fiscal costs for interest on bonds ranging from $18 million to $20 million \nover 3 years for the two SOCBs and APB; 34 \n(ii)  Costs associated with compensating and redeploying for displaced workers ($1 \nmillion-$2 million);  \n(iii)  Bank consolidation including disposing of unused assets and bank rationalization \n($9 million-$10 million); \n(iv)  Adopting and enforcing higher governance standards (policies and procedures, \nIT systems, higher disclosure) on banks through the governance agreements ($3 \nmillion-$4 million); \n                                                 \n34 Though principal payments may be due in future years should performance improve, these bonds will in the short \nrun, not be transferable nor discountable, so their face value is not included in the adjustment costs.  \n ", "  17  \n(v)  Detailed external audits of the SOCBs and APB to ensure compliance with the \ngovernance  agreements,  including  staff  costs  to  the  SOCBs  and  APB  for \npreparing to and engaging auditors ($1 million- $2 million); \n(vi)  Cost of setting up the commercial court and dedicating judges, an enforcement \ndepartment and enforcement officers, and establishing a secured registry ($0.5 \nmillion-$1 million); and \n(vii)  APB  restructuring  and  alternative  financing  mechanism  for  policy  lending \n($3.5million-$5 million). \n \n75.  As the costs are mostly fiscal, the impact on the budget of the restructuring program is \nprovided for in the agreed-upon medium term fiscal framework (Supplementary Appendix D) \nbeing supported through additional financing under the IMF\u2019s PRGF and the World Bank\u2019s \nFMAC.  \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Program Management    \n76.  As the Executing Agency for the program loan, BOL will have overall responsibility for \nensuring timely program implementation and reporting to ADB on progress made, problems \nencountered,  remedial  actions  taken  during  the  previous  quarter,  and  proposed  program \nactivities during the next quarter. Implementing agencies will include BOL, MOJ, MOF and the \nSOCBs, which will be responsible for effective day-to-day implementation of their components. \nMOF will be responsible for monitoring the use of the loan proceeds.  \n \n77.  To carry out its role, BOL will establish a bank restructuring implementation committee \n(BRIC),  chaired  by  the  deputy  governor  of  BOL,  empowered  to  oversee  program \nimplementation for both the program loan and all associated technical assistance, and ensure \nthat the proposed reforms are undertaken in accordance with the agreed-upon timetable. To \nmaintain continuity throughout implementation, the BRIC will initially include the director and \ndeputy director officials in charge of designing the Program, including the chairs of the Bank \nRestructuring Committee, NPL Committee, Human Resource Committee, IT Committee\u2013and \nwill include the BOL legal advisor as needed.  The BRIC will work closely with (i) other key \ndepartments  in  BOL,  such  as  BFSD  and  Internal  Audit;  (ii)  representatives  in  other \nimplementing agencies involved in BSRP; (iii) ministries with interest in such as the Ministry of \nLabor and Social Welfare and the Ministry of Security; and (iv) other relevant committees such \nas the Rural Finance TA steering committee, the rural and micro finance policy committee, and \nthe prospective program management unit of the EU Bank Training Project. The BRIC will meet \nat least quarterly to review progress reports and guide program implementation. Appendix 5 \ndepicts the implementation arrangements for the BSRP loan. \n \n78.  A program implementation unit (PIU) will be the working secretariat of the BRIC. The \nPIU will (i) coordinate the implementation of the banking components of the BSRP loan, (ii) \ncarry out administrative and fiduciary support for the MOJ-implemented judicial strengthening \ncomponent, (iii) support the BRIC and MOF in reporting on the progress of the program and use \nof the funds, (iv) organize all procurement and recruitment of consultants for the associated TA \nloan,35 and (v) report to ADB and other IFIs on Program implementation. To assist in building \nimplementation capacity and policy development, the BRIC and its working secretariat will be \nsupported with technical assistance during the first half of the program period.  \n \n                                                 \n35 Temporarily, staff from BOL\u2019s Economic and Research Department, with the assistance of ADB, is carrying out \nadvanced recruitment action for the IBAs. ", "18   \n2.  Procurement and Disbursement  \n79.  The loan will finance the full foreign exchange costs, excluding local duties and taxes, of \nimports procured in and from ADB\u2019s member countries, other than those specified in the list of \nineligible items (Appendix 6) and those items financed by other multilateral and bilateral official \nsources. Eligible items under ADB\u2019s loan will be procured using normal commercial practices by \nthe private sector or standard Government procurement procedures acceptable to ADB for \nprocurement by the public sector. Goods commonly traded on international commodity markets \nwill be procured in accordance with procedures appropriate to the trade and acceptable to ADB.  \n \n80.  The  loan  is  expected  to  be  utilized  over  48  months  from  loan  effectiveness.  The \nproceeds may be used to finance eligible imports for the period starting 180 days before loan \neffectiveness. On the basis of ADB\u2019s simplified procedures for disbursing program loans,36 the \nBorrower will be required to submit with each withdrawal request, a certification confirming the \nBorrower\u2019s compliance with the following formula for the period covered by the withdrawal \nrequest: for each year in which the proceeds are expected to be disbursed, the value of the \ncountry\u2019s total imports minus (i) imports from nonmember countries, (ii) ineligible imports, and \n(iii) imports financed under other official development agencies. This amount must be equal to \nor greater than the amounts expected to be disbursed during the year. ADB will have the right to \naudit the use of the loan proceeds and to verify the accuracy of the Borrower\u2019s certification. \n \n3.  Counterpart Funds \n81.  The  Government  will  use  counterpart  funds  to  finance  the  local  currency  costs  of \nimplementing the Program and other activities consistent with the objectives the Program. \n \n4.  Monitoring  \n82.  The  Government  and  ADB  will  continue  active  policy  dialogue  throughout  BSRP \nimplementation on matters relating to banking and financial sector development.  In particular, \nADB will closely monitor the implementation and impact of the banking sector reforms covering \nfinancial governance and potential staff retrenchment.  ADB will give close attention to the \npoverty impact of policy reforms and adjustment costs. \n \n83.  The PIU will coordinate the delivery of the various reports from the SOCBs, the BOL \nBFSD, MOF and MOJ. The PIU will also submit a consolidated report to ADB on a quarterly \nbasis covering BSRP implementation, particularly policy actions set out in the policy matrix and \ndevelopment policy letter, and on the accomplishment of the BSRP loan objectives. The reports \nwill be submitted in such form and in such detail and within such period as ADB may request, \nand should include, (i) progress made and problems encountered during the month or quarter in \nreview, (ii) steps taken or proposed to be taken to remedy problems encountered, (iii) the \nproposed detailed activity for BSRP implementation, and (iv) expected progress during the next \n3 months. If retrenchment is proposed for bank staff during the restructuring of the SOCBs, BOL \nwill report what was done under the agreed-upon retrenchment and mitigation plans. In addition, \nBOL will ensure that the SOCBs have their accounts audited annually by independent and \ncompetent auditors acceptable to ADB, with signed audits submitted to ADB within 6 months of \nthe end of the calendar year. At the minimum, audited financial statements will be in English and \nwill include income and expenditures, assets and liabilities, with the accompanying notes to the \naccounts.  \n \n                                                 \n36 ADB. 1998.

A program performance monitoring system will be applied to each project component to \nensure  that  the  program  is  realizing  its  expected  benefits.  The  PIU  will  develop  a \ncomprehensive monitoring system including the establishment of benchmarks, data collection, \nand analysis. Impacts to be measured are (i) the level of NPL resolution, with attention to cases \nheard by the commercial division; (ii) the enhanced good governance practices in the SOCBs; \n(iii) improved cost structures of the SOCBs with attention to the quality of credit analysis; and  \n(iv) more accurate financial reporting and controls. The PIU will submit a plan for monitoring \nprogram performance and preparing benchmark information for ADB\u2019s review and concurrence \nwithin 6 months of loan effectiveness. \n \n85.  ADB  will  send  regular  review  missions  to  assess  compliance  with  the  program \nrequirements  in  general  and  with  operational  policies  and  performance  targets  under  the \ngovernance agreements in particular. The missions will also review actions to ensure that \nprogram implementation remains on course. Within 2 years of the Program\u2019s start, ADB and the \nGovernment will jointly undertake a comprehensive midterm review to formulate within the \nupdated sector setting and other changing circumstances the necessary courses of action for \nthe Government and ADB to ensure program implementation. Not later than 3 months from the \nmidterm review and the completion of BSRP, the Government will prepare and furnish to ADB a \ncomprehensive report on the overall impact of the policy reforms implemented. The Government \nwill make the necessary information available to enable ADB to conduct reviews to ascertain \nthat the policies are being implemented and will keep ADB informed of outcomes of policy \ndiscussions that have implications for BSRP implementation. \n \n5.  Implementation Period and Tranching \n86.  The loan as proposed will cover an implementation period of 3 years and consist of three \ntranches that will be disbursed when ADB is assured that the conditions for release are \nsatisfied. The first tranche of $5 million will be made available following loan effectiveness. \nSubject to the Government\u2019s compliance with conditions, it is envisaged that the second tranche \nof $5 million will be disbursed within 19 months after release of the first tranche. The third \ntranche of $5 million is expected to be disbursed within 15 months after the second tranche, \nupon the Government's compliance with conditions. About 3 months before scheduled tranche \nrelease, ADB with the Government will review progress in implementing specified policy actions \nset out in the policy matrix.

TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  The Technical Assistance Grant \n87.  The TA grant will support the Government\u2019s strengthened implementation of the reform \nprogram in the area of effective banking sector restructuring and legal/judicial capacity. The TA \nwill assist the Government to implement key activities covered by the BSRP policy agenda:  \n(i)  Strengthen  Government  oversight  and  monitoring  capabilities  for  bank \nrestructuring  and  NPL  resolution  with  advisory  services  for  formulating \npostrestructuring strategy; \n(ii)  Assist SOCBs develop and implement NPL resolution strategies; \n(iii)  Establish the commercial division of the court and strengthen the legislative \nframework for commercial transactions; and \n(iv)  Assist  in  refining  a  new  banking  legislative  framework  including  anti-money \nlaundering legislation and surveillance system. \n \n88.  The TA will begin in January 2003 and will be implemented over 36 months ending \nDecember 2005.  A  total  of  23  person-months of international and 30 months of domestic \nconsulting services will be required. The TA costs a total of $900,000: $750,000 from the ADB \nTA Special Fund and $150,000 from the Canadian Governance Fund to cover judicial training. \nThe  consultants  will  have  expertise  in  bank  restructuring,  management  and  resolution  of \nproblem loans, human resource development, and commercial and banking-related law. They \nwill be recruited individually in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants, \nusing the simplified technical proposal procedures. All equipment will be procured in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. A full description, outline Terms of Reference and cost \nestimates are in Appendix 7.  \n \n89.  As  the  Executing  Agency  for  the  TA,  BOL  will  provide  the  necessary  qualified \ncounterpart staff and office space for the consultants. The implementation arrangements will be \nthe same as those for BSRP loan. A senior official from the BRIC will be appointed to serve as \nTA project manager and will be supported by the PIU. The BRIC will meet at least quarterly to \nreview and guide implementation \n ", "  21  \nB.  Related Technical Assistance \n1.  Technical Assistance Loan \n90.  A TA loan of $4 million to accompany the BSRP loan has been circulated to the Board \non 24 October 2002. This assists SOCBs\u2019 management achieve the operational and financial \nrestructuring objectives under the governance agreement. The TA loan will finance (i) IBAs in \neach of the two SOCBs for a period of 3 years, supplemented by technical experts to introduce \nspecific banking modules; (ii) IT systems for the SOCBs to support the transparency and \nefficiency goals of the program. BOL has begun advance recruitment action for the IBAs.  \n \n91.  The goal of the TA loan is measurable and meaningful change in the way the SOCBs \nconduct  their  daily  business.  IBAs  financed  under  the  TA  will  assist  the  SOCBs  in  (i) \nimplementing a multifaceted program of institutional and financial restructuring, (ii) achieving \nmajor efficiency and cost improvements, (iii) NPL resolution through focus on recovery of \ncurrent NPLs in the portfolio, (iv) ensuring that new flows of credit are of higher quality than in \nthe  past,  and  (v)  introducing  a  client  and  business  orientation  in  banking  relationships, \nparticularly when it comes to assisting SMEs to present bankable projects. \n \n2.  Other ADB-Financed Technical Assistance  \n92.  The BSRP loan activities are supported by ongoing and planned TA covering rural and \nmicro finance and the secured transactions system. In the case of rural finance, the current \npolicy discussion is the outcome of awareness building and policy reviews carried out under \nsub-project 1 of a cluster TA for rural and micro finance.37 Subproject 2 is supporting the \ndiagnostic, audit, and restructuring planning for APB. Other subprojects will be designed to \nsupport strategy formulation, reforms in APB, savings and credit unions, and the regulatory \nframework for rural and micro finance. Access to finance will be facilitated through a working \nsecured transactions framework and computerized registry, and will be supported through a \nprivate sector development TA in 2003.   \n \nVI.  PROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS  \nA.  Benefits and Impacts  \n93.  The current financial sector reveals substantial potential for developing and expanding \nfinance for private sector led growth and rural financial services for poverty reduction. The \npoverty impact is analyzed in Appendix 8. The first step is to establish a sound commercial \nfooting whereby good projects will be funded and poor ones will be terminated. The principle \nbehind BSRP is to strictly apply and enforce the commercial framework, thereby fostering good \ngovernance  behavior  throughout  the  fledgling  financial  system.  This  will  result  in  greater \ncertainty and predictability in all commercial transactions, particularly in enforcing loan and \nsecurity obligations. Such a change in the environment for commercial transactions will allow \ncommercial  banks,  foreign  and  domestic,  to  lend  to  a  wider  range  of  borrowers.  The \nmarket discipline embodied in the Program will build institutions that compare favorably with \nneighboring countries and provide the enabling environment for domestic private-sector-led \ngrowth and foreign direct investment. \n \n94.  A second more immediate and urgent benefit is support for macroeconomic stability. The \nGovernment is painfully aware of the cost (around 1.3% of GDP every 2 years) to the economy \nand to the Government budget resulting from the expensive process of restructuring state \nbanks. The Program will strengthen the country\u2019s ability to grow without the attendant risk of \n                                                 \n37 ADB 2000. Cluster TA for Rural and Microfinance. Manila.  ", "22   \nmacroinstability. Moreover, as the Government reorients its expenditure framework to ensure a \nhigher priority to social expenditures to reduce poverty, fiscal resources gained over the medium \nterm will allow the Government to reorient its role away from directing commercial resources \nand toward allocating resources to the social sector.  \n \n95.  As 90% of the country is outside the urban areas as are the majority of the poor in the \nLao PDR, a third benefit is the emergence of a sound sustainable outreach by the financial \nsector through a variety of models and methodologies. In the longer term, a rural finance sector \nthat is integrated into the overall banking infrastructure will yield significant benefits by moving \nliquidity around the country.  \n \n96.  A particularly important long-term benefit is the capacity that the Program is building in a \nset of bankers, judges, and policy makers for the future development of the commercial system. \nThe intensity of on-the-job restructuring work, coupled with simultaneous formal and informal \ntraining will produce stronger participants for future commercial development.  \n \nB.  Risks \n97.  The risks in the Program are significant, but manageable. Given the steps to mitigate \nthose risks, the integrated benefits and impacts are expected to outweigh the costs.  \n \n98.  As the Program is based on the assumption of a stable macroeconomic environment, \nany violation  of  this  could  adversely  affect  the  financial  performance  of  the  SOCBs. The \nmacroeconomic risk is being minimized through the monitored fiscal and monetary framework \nunder the IMF\u2019s PRGF, attention to better financial reporting and limits to credit expansion under \nthe  World  Bank\u2019s  FMAC,  and  the  emphasis  on  sound  banking,  financial  disclosure,  and \nperformance monitoring under the proposed BSRP. \n \n99.  A second risk concerns the ability and will of the Government to implement the broad \nreform program, given the constituencies that are against reforms, particularly in the provinces, \nand the need to sustain arduous restructuring over a long period. The risk is being mitigated by \na  continuation  in  the  year-long  program  of  ownership  building;  strong  aid  coordination in \ndialogue and instruments; and a front-loaded, performance-based program design and flexibility \nin the underlying program parameters. The Government\u2019s commitment to carry out and sustain \nthe range of reforms under the Program is demonstrated by up front actions of merit already \ntaken.  \n \n100.  A third risk is that the proposed reforms will be undertaken by ministries, officials, and \nbankers  that  are  relatively  inexperienced  and  lacking  in  technical  knowledge,  raising  the \npossibility of uneven and slow implementation.   This risk is addressed through a significant \namount of TA in the form of resident advisors, coupled with formalized training courses and \nbasic training in standardized loan documents and required financial statements. In addition to \nresident IBAs inside the SOCBs, there will be resident advisors to the bank restructuring \noversight unit and to the judiciary. The deployment of multiple advisors throughout the financial \nsystem will be balanced with country ownership concerns through care in designing TOR that \nmaintains appropriate accountability. \n \n101.  A fourth risk is that restructuring the SOCBs may result in redundancies and this could \nlead to resentment and grassroots resistance, especially in provincial branches. Consultation \nand  awareness  building  have  begun  and  will  continue  throughout  implementation.  The \nGovernment, in consultation with the stakeholders and as agreed upon with ADB, has also \ncommitted that mitigation measures will be an integral part of the restructuring program should \nthere be adverse effects on vulnerable SOCB staff.  \n ", "  23 \nVII.  ASSURANCES \n102.  In  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n(i)  The Government will promptly adopt and implement the policies and program \nactions indicated in the Program as specified in the Policy Letter, including the \nPolicy Matrix, in a timely manner and shall ensure that such policies and actions \nwill be sustained.  \n(ii)  The Government will actively assist and support ongoing program monitoring and \nevaluation by facilitating consultations with central and provincial agencies, and \nother key stakeholders as appropriate.  \n(iii)  The  Government  will  keep  ADB  informed  of  policy  discussions  with  other \nstakeholders about measures to ensure effective implementation of the Program. \n(iv)  The Government will provide ADB with the opportunity to comment on relevant \nstudies and draft laws or decrees that are likely to impact on program objectives \nand implementation. \n(v)  The Government will ensure that adequate and timely funds are made available \nto BOL and relevant central agencies and provincial administrations to facilitate \nimplementation of the Program. \n(vi)  The Government will use its best endeavors to enter anti-money laundering \ninformation sharing and cooperation arrangements with regulatory institutions in \nthe Asian and Pacific Region. \nVIII.

Introduction  \n1.  The proposed Banking Sector Reform Program (BSRP) loan supports a 3-year program \nthat seeks a restructuring of the banking sector, measurable and meaningful change in the \noperations  of  two  state-owned  commercial  banks  (SOCBs)  and  strengthened  legal  and \nregulatory structures to support the restructured operations of the banks operating in the Lao \nPeople\u2019s  Democratic  Republic  (Lao  PDR).  The  Government  has  requested  technical \nassistance1  (TA)  to  support  the  Program,  focusing  on  the  bank  restructuring  activities, \nparticularly the nonperforming loan resolution activities, and strengthening the judicial support \nfor good banking. \n  \nB.  Background and Rationale  \n2.  To strengthen SOCB governance, the BSRP loan will support governance agreements \nbetween the SOCBs, BOL, and the Government to guide, gauge, and enforce restructuring \ncommitments; and obtain temporary operational support from international banking advisors \n(IBAs). The governance agreements will provide a yearly guide to the restoration of SOCB \nhealth  through  operational  restructuring  and,  contingent  on  performance  improvements, \nfinancial  support.  The  IBAs  will  assist  bank  management  to  implement  the  multifaceted \nturnaround plans embodied in the restructuring program of each bank.  \n \n3.  The BSRP loan will also support case-by-case resolution of individual accounts in \ndefault primarily through legislative measures and judicial support for SOCB actions to address \nborrowers in default. This will involve (i) developing a strategy for the timely and effective \nrecovery of NPLs, (ii) planning and implementing targets on resolution and cash collection, (iii) \narticulating  generic  issues  on  NPL  resolution,  and  (iv)  developing  and  implementing  a \ncommunications program to improve the local credit culture. The judiciary\u2019s support for NPL \nresolution  will  be  strengthened  through  improved  legislative  measures  to  strengthen  the \nenvironment  for  NPL  recovery,  establishing  the  commercial  court,  standardizing  loan  and \nsecurity  documentation,  and  implementing  a  program  to  strengthen  the  enforcement  of \ncommercial judgments.  \n \nC.  The Proposed Technical Assistance \n1.  Objective and Scope  \n4.  The  TA  aims  for  a  strengthened  banking  sector  supported  by  a  conducive  legal \nenvironment  and  effective  judicial  processes.  It  will  assist  the  Government  to  strengthen \nshareholder  oversight  of  bank  restructuring,  including  (i)  strategy  development;  (ii)  human \nresource (HR) development; (iii) case by case NPL resolution; and (iv) the legal and judicial \nframework to support NPL resolution, including establishing a commercial division of the court \nand strengthening the framework for commercial transactions.  \n \na.  Oversight of SOCB Restructuring and Strategy Development  \n5.  The performance-based nature of the program and its heavy emphasis on monitoring \nand evaluation make restructuring oversight a key part of program implementation. Therefore, \n                                                 \n1 The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities in August, 2002. ", "  Appendix 7  49 \nthe Government is establishing a bank restructuring implementation committee (BRIC) chaired \nby the deputy governor of Bank of Lao PDR (BOL) and charged with overseeing program \nimplementation with special emphasis on monitoring SOCB compliance with the governance \nagreements. To carry out day-to-day implementation duties, a program implementation unit \n(PIU) will be attached to the BRIC.    \n \n6.  The TA will provide a Bank Restructuring Advisor to assist the newly formed BRIC to \ncarry out the executing agency oversight responsibilities for the Program as a whole, with \nemphasis  on  ensuring  implementation  and  monitoring  of  the  plans  in  the  governance \nagreements.2 The responsibilities include helping to build the capacity to monitor, oversee, \nrevise, and otherwise manage the contracts with the international banking advisors; assessing \nSOCB compliance with operational performance targets; arranging and ensuring that SOCBs \nare audited according to appropriate terms of reference (TORs) and using acceptable auditors \nand winding up former SOCBs and developing a monitoring and reporting methodology for the \nprogram. The bank restructuring advisor will also assist the Government to specify a 5-year \nstrategy for banking development after restructuring to serve as a road map in deepening and \nbroadening the banking reforms, and to expand the policy agenda.  \n \nb.  Human Resource Development \n7.  One of the key components of the bank restructuring plans is the plan to rationalize the \nstaff complement of the SOCBs by (i) introducing a new set of personnel and HR policies and \nprocedures, (ii) developing a program of training and scholarships for promising SOCB staff, (iii) \nensuring that a system that matches staff skills and job requirements is put in place, and (iv) \nproposing a performance reward system to introduce positive and negative incentives related to \njob  performance.  The  TA  will  provide  an  HR  specialist  to  assist  the  IBAs  early  in  the \nrestructuring program to develop the HR program for the SOCBs. Because the HR plan includes \nstaff retrenchment, the TA will help the Government develop the specifications to mitigate the \nadverse impact on nonmanagement staff.    \n \nc.  NPL Resolution \n8.  A primary objective of the program is the case-by-case resolution of NPLs, which have \nemerged in recent years. The methods for resolving the solutions will vary and be dependent on \n(i) the type of borrower, (ii) the source of the NPL, and (iii) the future viability of the borrower. \nTherefore, the TA will assist SOCBs in assessing each NPL of a minimum size, developing \nindividual strategies for addressing NPLs and preparing guidelines for SOCBs to use when \nimplementing each strategy. Of particular emphasis is the role of judicial action in the cases of \nborrowers in default and the role of structured negotiations around a enterprise and debt \nrestructuring program.   \n \n9.  The TA will focus particularly on these types of cases as demonstration and training for \nthe  principal  approach  to  NPL  in  a  private  sector  oriented  commercial  system.  The  NPL \nresolution plans being carried out inside the SOCBs will be closely coordinated with the program \nto build the judicial capacity in this area and will complement these efforts through assistance to \nSOCBs in case preparation, management and resolution. The TA will help prepare and submit \nat least 10 cases for presentation to the newly formed commercial division of the court. The TA \n                                                 \n2 The seven plans are, (i) organizational, (ii) operational, (iii) fixed assets rationalization, (iv) NPL recovery plan and \nbranch rationalization, (v) human resource, (vi) information technology, and (vii) financial and capital build-up plan. \n ", "50  Appendix 7 \nwill  also  help  prepare  standardized  loan  and  security  documentation  and  will  assist  in \nimplementing a structured voluntary system for borrowers undergoing restructuring.  \n \nd.  Support for Legal and Judicial Strengthening  \n10.  To support the Program\u2019s emphasis on strengthening the involuntary approach to NPL \nresolution, the TA will help the Government establish a commercial division of the court and \ntrain the officials for the new court division. The TA will provide a technical legal advisor to (i) \nhelp draft the necessary rules of court; (ii) train judges, SOCB personnel, and enforcement \nofficers to understand and apply the new rules; (iii) establish monitoring and evaluation of \ncommercial  division  cases;  and  (iv)  conduct  campaigns  for  public  awareness  of  the  new \nprocedures and ensure regular exchange of information and consensus building among the \nstakeholders, both private and public, for the judicial reform process.  \n \n11.  The  TA  will  also  help  the  Government  to  draft  standardized  loan  and  security \ndocumentation and ensure that the SOCBs adopt and use the model documentation. Training in \nthe standardized documentation will be offered to commercial judges, bank staff, private legal \npractitioners, and businesspersons. The TA will also support the legislative and information \nrequirements to establish the anti-money-laundering system. \n \n2.  Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n12.  The  combined  cost  of  the  TA  is  estimated  at  $1,059,000  equivalent,  comprising \n$842,000 in foreign exchange and $217,000 equivalent in local currency (Table A8). ADB will \nprovide $900,000 equivalent to cover the foreign exchange cost of $842,000 and part of the \nlocal currency cost equivalent to $58,000. The TA will be financed on a grant basis from ADB's \ntechnical assistance fund (TASF) and from the ADB-managed Canadian Governance Fund. The \nGovernment  of  the  Lao  PDR  will  provide  the  balance of the local currency cost in kind: \nexperienced  counterpart  staff,  office  space,  information  and  data  collection,  transportation \nassistance, and communications.  \n \n13.  The TA will start in January 2003 and will be implemented over a 36-month period \nending  December  2006.  Consulting  services  will  comprise  53  person  months:  23  for \ninternational consultants with expertise in bank restructuring, financial sector strategy, program \nmanagement, labor displacement, judicial processes, bad loan management commercial, and \nbanking-related law; and 30 for domestic research assistance. The consultants will be recruited \nas individuals in accordance with  ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants, using the \nsimplified technical proposal procedures. All equipment will be procured in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement.    \n \n3.  Implementation Arrangements \n14.  The Executing Agency for the TA will be BOL. The implementation arrangements will be \nthe same as those for the BSRP loan. The BRIC, assigned to oversee program implementation \nunder the BSRP loan, will also oversee TA implementation. A senior official from the BRIC will \nbe appointed to serve as TA project manager and will be supported by the PIU. As BOL and \nMinistry of Justice (MOJ) will implement the TA, the BRIC and the PIU will support the BOL and \nMOJ related activities to ensure greatest efficiency in the use of resources. An inception report \nprepared within 4 weeks of the start of services, will give a time-bound work program together \nwith a schedule of progress reports. For each component, a draft final report will be submitted ", "  Appendix 7  51 \nand a final report, incorporating the comments of the Government and ADB.

Introduction \n1.  The purpose of the Banking Sector Reform Program (BSRP) loan is to promote the \ndevelopment of an effective market-based financial system. This appendix describes Lao PDR\u2019s \npoverty profile, analyzes weaknesses in the current system, and examines the impact of the \nBSRP loan on poverty reduction. \n \nB.  Poverty Profile \n2.  Poverty in Lao PDR, as in most neighboring countries, is concentrated in rural areas. \nAccording to the most recently prepared estimates for (1997/98), 22.1% of the urban population \nand 42.5% of the rural population (and 39.1% of the total population) were poor. Since 83.3% of \nthe population resided in rural areas in 1997/98, these estimates imply that 91% of the poor \nreside in the rural areas.  \n \n3.  Within the rural areas, the poor tend to reside in relatively remote villages, depend \nlargely on subsistence farming both for employment and as a source of income, and live in \nrelatively large households with relatively high dependency burdens. Recently prepared poverty \nestimates suggest that the poor have benefited from rapid economic growth taking place before \nthe economic crisis in 1997. Overall, the percentage of the population\u2019s poor declined at an \nannual  rate  of  3.1  between  1993  and  1998.  However,  reductions  in  poverty  have  been \ngeographically uneven, whereby urban-rural disparities are widening. Thus, while economic \ngrowth has reduced poverty effectively in  the Lao PDR, it has not done so uniformly. The \nnonpoor has benefited more from economic growth than the poor, resulting in overall increases \nin inequality. In particular, owing to a shallow financial system, those who live outside the \nmonetized economy (i.e the rural poor) have not achieved the full benefits of economic growth. \n \nC.  Government Focus on Poverty Reduction  \n 4.  The diagram below depicts a standard transmission mechanism between Government \npolicy and the goal of poverty reduction.  The BSRP loan supports this transmission mechanism \nby focusing on issues affecting macroeconomic stability and economic growth, availability of \nfiscal resources for poor-targeted programs, distribution of wealth, and employment creation. \n ", "56  Appendix 8 \n1.  Macroeconomic Stability and Economic Growth \n \n5.  Progress in poverty reduction, and particularly the achievement of the Government\u2019s \nambitious poverty reduction goals, requires a sustained rate of economic growth in the 7% \nrange.  Weaknesses in the banking system hinders economic growth potential not only risks in \nmaintaining  macroeconomic  stability  but  also  limits  to  efficient  resource  allocation  as  the \nbanking system provides the key channel through which domestic savings are allocated within \nthe real economy. Currently, as the state-owned banks perform this financial intermediation role \nvery  poorly,  the  resulting  lack  of  confidence  in  the  banks  undoubtedly  reduces  domestic \nsavings,  while  the  inefficient  allocation  of  credit  among  enterprises  reduces  the  marginal \nproductivity of domestic capital, thereby contributing to slower economic growth. \n \n2.  Fiscal Resources \n \n6.  The operating losses of the state-owned banking sector require increasing levels of \nfinancial  support  by  the  Government.  The  Government  currently  spends  relatively  small \npercentages of its gross domestic product (GDP) on social services compared with other low-\nincome countries in the region. This coupled with the low level of income per capita, (about \n$330)1, translates into under funded social sector requirements, especially in the case of the \nrural poor. Improving access of the rural poor to good-quality social services depends critically \non  the  Government\u2018s  ability  to  mobilize  the  necessary  recurrent  financing  to  support  the \neffective operation of largely aid-funded investments in rural education and health services. \n  \n3.  Even Distribution of Income and Wealth \n \n7.  Most likely, until the financial services are more widely available in the Lao PDR, \neconomic growth will continue to take place with an associated deterioration in the distribution of \nincome and wealth as has been the experience in neighboring countries, such as the People\u2019s \nRepublic of China, Malaysia, Thailand, and Viet Nam. Therefore, financial sector reform is \nneeded to ensure that a broader range of the population benefits from economic growth in the \nfuture. Had income inequality remained unchanged during the five years preceding the Asian \ncrises, the percentage of the population living in poverty would have declined at an estimated \nannual rate of 5.2%, instead of the observed rate of 3.3%.  \n \n4.  Employment Creation \n \n8.  Private sector development, particularly of micro and small enterprises, is critical for \nachieving the employment opportunities needed for a rapidly growing population. Therefore, \nimproving access to financial services for small and medium enterprises (SME), and in rural \nareas generally will support off-and on-farm productivity growth and employment creation that is \nneeded to reduce poverty. Providing opportunities for the rural poor to supplement their incomes \nwith nonfarm employment (i.e., diversifying their employment opportunities) is also an important \npart  of  the  path  to  poverty  reduction,  particularly  as  the  rural  sector  is  often  prone  to \nunavoidable economic shocks.  \n \n                                                 \n1 IMF,  Lao PDR Staff Report, 2002. ", "  Appendix 8  57 \nD.  Banking Sector Reform Impact Assessment \n9.  The BSRP loan has four main components to address the issues brought up in the \nprevious section. Each component, if successfully implemented, is expected to contribute to \nfurther poverty reduction.  \n \n1.  Bank Restructuring \n \n10.  Bank restructuring is needed to achieve not only higher rates of economic growth and \nensure macroeconomic stability; it is required to ensure that the benefits of economic growth are \nshared by all segments of the population.  In particular, the improved lending performance of the \nstate-owned  banking  sector  should  increase  the  overall  productivity  of  bank  credit  in  the \nmedium term, leading to a more rapid rate of economic growth and increased employment \nopportunities for the poor and nonpoor alike. \n \n11.   Reductions both in the state-owned bank operating losses and in the amount of non-\nperforming loans should contribute to increased confidence in the banking system and enhance \nthe economy\u2019s macrostability. Such increased confidence and enhanced macrostability can \nlead, in turn, to increased domestic savings, increased foreign investment, and to significantly \ndiminished pressures on the Lao currency and to a reduced risk of a fiscal and monetary crisis. \n   \n11.  Increased economic growth and macroeconomic stability will also lead to increases in \ntax revenue that can be used to support poverty reduction investments in such areas as rural \ninfrastructure, education, and health. More directly, the improved performance of the state-\nowned banking sector should also attenuate the fiscal burden of the state-owned banking sector \nin the medium term, contributing to increased fiscal resources for poor-targeted programs.  \n \n2.  Strengthening the Enabling Legal Environment and Judicial Oversight \n \n12.  This component of the BSRP loan will strengthen the ability of the banking sector, both \nstate-owned and private to resolve nonperforming loans. In particular, this component will make \nit easier for all banks to recover assets more rapidly, creating better discipline in the granting \nand receiving of bank loans.  Such predictability and enforceability of loan contracts is critical in \nachieving the objective of greater involvement of banks and eventually other parts of the \nfinancial system in the performance of the economy.  \n \n3.  Strengthening Private Sector Access to Finance \n \n13.  This component will increase the availability of credit and other financial services to all \nparticipants in the economy and, based on marginal productivity of credit (assuming that the \nmarginal productivity of credit is higher in the private than in the public sector) and therefore \nlead to a higher rate of economic growth. The goal of broad based growth as a component of \npoverty reductions must include greater access  to finance and a deepening of the financial \nsector from a level which is one of the most shallow in the word.   \n \n4.  Rural and Micro Finance \n \n14.  Currently, there are substantial obstacles to the development of rural finance in the Lao \nPDR. Much of the rural population is poor and uneducated, living in remote areas, with few \nassets that can be used to secure loans. Among the rural poor, the demand for credit is limited \nmainly to finance consumption smoothing. In more prosperous lowland rural areas, loans are \n ", "58  Appendix 8 \nusually obtained from moneylenders and operations of the Agriculture Promotion Bank (APB).  \nHowever, both the practice and coverage of rural moneylenders in creating an informal credit \nsystem coupled with APB\u2019s subsidized credit service retards rather than aids the development \nof alternative rural credit institutions. A reform of APB\u2019s mandate and procedures will contribute \nto the development of a more diversified and expanded commercially-oriented rural credit \nsystem and create more participation in the formal financial sector. This should lower the cost of \nand increase the access to rural credit by borrowers currently shut out of the formal rural credit \nsystem,  thereby  contributing  to  increased  economic  growth  and  expanded  employment \nopportunities in the rural areas.  \n \nE.  Conclusion \n15.  The overall benefits of the BSRP loan for poverty reduction can be summarized as \nsupporting  better  commercial  environment  for  financial  services,  particularly  intermediation \nservices which in turn would provide positive effects on the poor and nonpoor through enhanced \nmacroeconomic  stability  and  economic  growth,  employment  creation  in  the  medium  term, \nincreased fiscal space to support rural infrastructure investment and social services, and more \nequitable distribution of income and wealth. \n \n \n ", "  Appendix 8  59 \nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY \n \nA.  Linkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \nSector identified as a national      Yes  Sector identified as a national priority               Yes \npriority in country poverty analysis?  in country poverty partnership agreement?  \nPoverty in the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (PDR), as in most neighboring countries, is concentrated in the \nrural areas. According to the most recently prepared estimates for 1997-98,1 22.1% of the urban population and \n42.5% of the rural population (and 39.1% of the total population) were poor. Since 83.3% of the population resided in \nrural areas in 1997-98, these estimates imply that 91% of the poor reside in the rural areas. Within the rural areas, \nthe poor reside in relatively remote villages, tend to be illiterate or poorly educated, own or have access to limited \nland and other assets, depend largely on subsistence farming both for employment and as a source of income, and \nlive in relatively large households with relatively high dependency burdens. \n \nRecently prepared poverty estimates suggest that the poor have benefited from rapid economic growth taking place \nbefore the economic crises in 1997. Overall, the poor population declined at an annual rate of 3.1% between 1993 \nand 1998. However, reductions in poverty have been geographically uneven, while urban-rural disparities are \nwidening. Thus, while economic growth has reduced poverty effectively in the Lao PDR it has not done so uniformly \nor equitably. The non-poor have benefited more from economic growth than the poor; the result is overall increased \ninequality. In particular, those who live outside the monetized economy (i.e., most of the rural poor) have not been \nable to participate in the benefits of economic growth. The banking sector\u2019s contribution to poverty reduction in Lao \nPDR. \n \nIn the Lao PDR, the banking sector contributes the stability as well as the growth of the economy. As the government \ntries to reach its poverty reduction goals, economic growth needs to target a range in excess of 7%. A sound financial \nsector \u2013 in this case dominated by the state-owned banks \u2013 will be an indispensable part of this growth rate, as \ngrowth is directly linked to a deepening in the financial sector. Further, the soundness of banks reflects the general \nconfidence level in the system and can provide the needed price and exchange stability for the real economy to \nexpand in a sustainable and broad-based manner.     \n \nThe banking system is also an important channel through which domestic savings are allocated to support the good \nprojects in the private sector, particularly small and medium-size enterprises (SMEs). Currently, many businesses \nsuffer from limited access to commercial credit, and the development of the private sector will benefit from the \nincreased availability of appropriately priced financial products, which in turn, will encourage employment creation \nassociated with the expected growth of SMEs. \n \nOn a more fundamental level, an overall effective financial system can provide services that are equally available to \nthe urban and rural population, the financially well-off, and the poor.  Expansion of the financial sector, particularly in \nthe Lao PDR, is a key requirement for a more equitable distribution of the benefits from rising growth rates and a \nmore robust business sector. Efforts to reach out to all regions and facilitate access to credit on commercial terms will \nbe critical to narrowing the gap in the Lao PDR. Improving access to financial services will boost widespread \nproductivity growth and employment creation. \n \nIn the Lao PDR, there are five main channels by which banking system reform can contribute to further poverty \nreduction: \nMacroeconomic stability and economic growth \nFiscal space \nDistribution of income and wealth \nEmployment creation \nExtension of sustainable financial services \n1 Nanak Kakwani, Gaurav Datt, Bounthavy Siousphanhthong, Phonesaly Souksavath, and Limin Wang. 2002. \n\u201cPoverty in Lao PDR During the 1990s,\u201d Revised May 31,2002.

Lastly, increased confidence in the banking system and enhanced macrostability can be expected to lead, in \nturn, to a lower risk premium on domestic financial assets (lowering the costs of borrowing), increased domestic \nsavings, increased foreign investment, significantly diminished pressures on the Lao currency and a reduced risk of a \nfiscal and monetary crisis. \nImpact on access of the poor to finance \nWhile the poor may not benefit directly from this loan component in the short term, they are likely to receive indirect \nbenefits as a result of higher rates of broad-based economic growth, which should lead to more rapid growth in \nemployment. In the medium term, with lower costs of financial services and price levels, the poor\u2019s access to credit \nand asset accumulation will also improve. \nImpact on rural areas \nAlong with the inaccessibility to credit to the poor, there is also a significant urban/rural divide. Because the current \nbanking system is inefficient and biased toward urban areas, it creates substantial obstacles for the development of \nrural finance. Reform in the banking system may increase the supply of credit to rural households. The program\u2019s \nobjective is, among others, to develop a more diversified and commercial-oriented rural credit system. This should \nhelp accelerate economic growth and expand employment opportunities and thereby improve the distribution of \nincome and wealth in the rural areas. \nC.
