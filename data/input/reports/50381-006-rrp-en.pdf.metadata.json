The  project  will  benefit  poor,  rural  residents  in  the    Bago\u2013Kyaikto  corridor  by \nproviding climate-resilient, safe, and more efficient connectivity between Bago and Kyaikto, and \nto other destinations in the EWEC. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nMacroeconomic  context  and  impact  of  the  coronavirus  disease  pandemic.  Since \n2012 when the Government of Myanmar decided to reengage with the international community \nand initiated structural reforms, Myanmar has been aiming to achieve sustained economic growth \nthrough  the  market  economy,  with  strong  growth  averaging  6.4%  in  2015\u20142019.  In  2020, \nhowever, despite a moderate but recently increasing number of confirmed coronavirus disease \n(COVID-19) cases, disruptions to key economic sectors and to trade and investment flows stand \nto  derail  its  growth  trajectory,  down  from  an  original  estimate  of  6.8%  to  1.8%,  equivalent  to \neconomic  losses  of  $3.3  billion.  COVID-19  may  also  slow  Myanmar\u2019s  significant  progress  in \npoverty  reduction  because  large  poor  and  vulnerable  populations  are  least  able  to  cope.  Job \nlosses, including those for returning migrants, are estimated at 1.2 million\ua7f72.1 million, and the \nnumber of the poor is likely to increase by 1.3 million.2 There are concerns that job losses may \nincrease due to continued slowdown in Thailand and other economies. The project is expected to \nassist Myanmar\u2019s post COVID-19 economic recovery by helping to create jobs through increased \nroad transport efficiency and providing support for integrated and sustainable economic growth.  \n \n4. \nTransport  sector  issues  and  opportunities.  A  key  ingredient  of  the  government\u2019s \nstrategy for economic growth has been to modernize the country\u2019s transport system. Increasing \ninfrastructure investments especially improving its highway network will enable Myanmar to take \nfull advantage of its geographical location in the region and global value chains and realize its \ngrowth  potential.3 However,  Myanmar\u2019s  transport  infrastructure  has  lagged  behind  the  rest  of \nSoutheast Asia because of inadequate investment. Myanmar invested only about 1% of its gross \ndomestic  product  during  2005\u20132018  in  transport  infrastructure,  while  faster-growing  Asian \ncountries  invested  about  3%.  In  2017,  the  government  estimated  that  14  million  people  in \nMyanmar  lived  in  villages  that  are  physically  isolated  because  there  is  no  connecting  road,  or \nbecause the road is flooded or becomes muddy during the rainy season.  \n \n5. \nTo hasten and leverage government investment, the Ministry of Construction (MOC) had \ncontracted 26 private concessionaires to manage and improve the main highways, about 5,545 \n\n \n\n1  The GMS corridors comprise a number of corridors, including the EWEC. The EWEC runs from Viet Nam through \n\nthe Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, and Thailand to Myanmar, linking economic centers in the GMS. \n\n2  ADB. 2020. Proposed Countercyclical Support Facility Loan Republic of the Union of Myanmar: COVID-19 Active \nResponse and Expenditure Support Program. Manila; ADB. 2020. Asian Development Outlook Supplement. Manila.  \n\n3  Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2014. Myanmar: Unlocking the Potential. Country Diagnostic Study. Manila. \n\n \n\n\f \n\nkm  in  total.  However,  the  concession  arrangements  currently  in  place  have  had  mixed  results \nbecause  of  limited  MOC  capacity  to  manage  concessionaires  including  ineffective  concession \nagreements, low toll revenues, and poor execution of operation and maintenance (O&M).4 The \nhigh risk of not being able to induce sufficient traffic for large capital investments has also made \nit  difficult  to  attract  upfront  private  sector  investments.  The  experience  indicates  that  an \nincremental approach which takes into account the capacity of the MOC and the risk of the traffic \nlevel should be pursued, starting with improving O&M arrangements where feasible. \n \nIn 2012, the government removed restrictions on vehicle imports, resulting in gradually \n6.  \nincreased traffic on the road network. This has led to growing congestion as well as to faster road \ndeterioration, resulting in a shorter useful road life, where a study estimated that only 71% of the \nnational highways are paved.5 The government plans to increase transport investments to 3% of \ngross domestic product by 2030 by refocusing on the main corridors and ensuring adherence to \ninternational design standards to keep road conditions in a fair to good condition for the roads\u2019 \nuseful life for passenger safety. Government objectives outlined in the National Transport Sector \nDevelopment  Master  Plan  and  the  Master  Plan  for  Arterial  Road  Network  Development  in \nMyanmar  provide  guidance  for  long-term  investments. 6  The  government\u2019s  strategy  is  to \nmodernize and improve management of the existing highway network and to develop an arterial \nhighway  network  on  straighter  alignments  for  a  more  efficient  transportation,  while  avoiding \nsettled areas. \n \n7. \nGreater  Mekong  Subregion  corridors.  The  GMS  corridors  are  the  backbone  of \nMyanmar\u2019s transport system. The EWEC in particular connects Da Nang in Viet Nam with Yangon \nand its special economic zone of Thilawa, and further west to Pathein. The sections of the EWEC \nin Thailand, the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, and Viet Nam have been completed based \non international standards, with improved border facilities. Improvements in connectivity between \nBago  and  Kyaikto  along  the  EWEC  will  reduce  national  transport  costs  within  Myanmar  and \nimprove regional connectivity with Thailand and onwards to the rest of the GMS.7 About 3,000\u2013\n11,000 vehicles per day used the segment of the EWEC in Myanmar in 2017. The traffic volume \nhas been increasing since 2012, and the Myanmar segment of the EWEC is likely to reach its full \ncapacity of about 15,000 vehicles per day about 2025-2030 (footnotes 3 and 5). \n \nRoad safety. Most of the road corridors in Myanmar, including those in the EWEC, have \n8. \nonly two lanes, with pavement condition ranging from poor to fair. Road safety is a serious issue, \nand Myanmar\u2019s crash fatality rate is among the highest in Southeast Asia with 21 fatalities per \n100,000 inhabitants with 95% of fatalities attributable to road user behavior errors.8 Alignments \nof existing roads go through populated areas. Low design standards together with a mix of road \nusers (motorized and nonmotorized vehicles, pedestrians, and animals) make it unsafe for vehicle \nspeeds greater than 60 km per hour.  \n \nPro-poor focus of the project. The Bago\u2013Kyaikto corridor across the Bago region and \n9. \nMon state has higher poverty rate (31.0%) than the national average (24.8%). Poverty is further \n\n \n\n4   ADB. 2016.

Geneva. \n\n2 \n\n \n\n\f \n\naggravated by the fact that people living in rural areas along the EWEC, including those living \nalong the Bago\u2013Kyaikto corridor, cannot fully benefit from road connections because of the limited \nrural  road  network.  In  the  Bago  region  and  Mon  state  where  the  project  will  be  located,  the \ngovernment  estimates  that  1.4  million  people  have  inadequate  rural  road  access.9 In  addition, \nthese areas are also prone to floods, exasperated by climate change, damaging existing roads. \nFloods also prevent road access or result in only seasonal access, as shown by the severe flood \nof  July  2017  which  inundated  the    Bago\u2013Kyaikto  road,  limiting  its  access  for  three  days.  The \nproject  will enhance connectivity along the segment of the  EWEC between Bago and Kyaikto, \nthus benefiting the Bago region and Mon state through increased trade, tourism, and investment \nactivities with other GMS countries, particularly Thailand, by bringing producers and consumers \ncloser to markets and creating employment and income opportunities for people living on both \nsides of the border. In addition, about 70,000 residents along the proposed alignment will benefit \nfrom  access  roads  to be  paved  under  the  project  (about  25  km),  which  will  provide  direct  and \nclimate-resilient access to the newly constructed expressway and other existing roads. \n \n10. \nThe government\u2019s sector strategy and the role of the proposed project. The project \nwill help the government with its long-term objective to develop an arterial highway network, which \nis essential to achieving rapid economic growth. In line with the government\u2019s Master Plan for \nArterial Road Network Development in Myanmar (footnote 6), which includes the proposed Bago\u2013\nKyaikto expressway, the construction of about 560 km of arterial highways has already begun. \nAnother  3,290  km  of  arterial  highways  are  planned  to  be  constructed  during  2020\u20132030.  The \narterial  highway  development  program  accounts  for  half  of  Myanmar\u2019s  long-term  transport \ninvestment needs.  \n \nThe project will improve the capacity of the Bago\u2013Kyaikto section of the EWEC, where the \n11. \ncurrent two-lane road has high traffic volumes (para. 7). A prefeasibility study prepared by the \nJapan international Cooperation Agency (JICA) indicates that this section would reach capacity \nsometime  between  2025  and  2030.  Upgrading  the  existing  road  is  not  the  preferred  solution \nbecause its widening would involve large resettlement impacts, and the alignment of the existing \nroad is long and winding in several areas. The proposed project will construct a new, four-lane \nBago\u2013Kyaikto expressway that is 32 km shorter than the current segment of the EWEC. It will \nhalve  the  current  travel  time  of  110  minutes  between  Bago  and  Kyaikto  and  provide  all-year \naccess to townships in the project area.  \n \n12. \nCOVID-19 Recovery through the Project. Creating sustained recovery opportunities will \nbe  critical.  Strengthening  road  connectivity  can  play  an  important  role  on  this  front,  as  the \nproposed expressway will reduce transport time and costs; open new economic and employment \nopportunities  through  linkages  to  new  markets  and  production  centers;  and  increase  the  local \npopulation\u2019s access to health, education, and other social services. In the short-term, the project \nitself will create significant construction and other ancillary jobs. Several micro, small and medium-\nsized enterprises in the construction value chain will be supported. Over the medium to long-term, \nthere  is  a  strong  link  between  improved  transport  and  poverty  reduction  for  inclusive  growth. \nFurthermore, improved accessibility to local and regional markets through better roads increases \nopportunities for women to participate in the labor market. \n  \n\n9  Government of Myanmar. 2017.

The project builds on ADB\u2019s past and ongoing experience with road \n14. \nprojects in Myanmar and incorporates the following lessons from such interventions, as reflected \nin  the  project  design:  (i)  providing  road  access  with  pavement  surfacing  suitable  for  local \nchallenges and conditions; (ii) improving the capacity of the local contracting industry in deciding \npackage size  for contracts; (iii) ensuring that the project is implemented in a timely manner by \nmanaging environment and resettlement safeguards issues efficiently during project planning; (iv) \nenhancing road safety for expressway ramps at designated intercity bus stops; and (v) enhancing \nproject  readiness  of  future  projects  through  fast-tracked  detailed  design  prepared  under  an \nongoing loan (footnote 21), based on continuous discussions with the borrower. \n \nB. \n \n15. \nThe project is aligned with the following impact: an arterial highway network established \nin  support  of  economic  development,  regional  economic  growth,  and  international  industrial \ncompetitiveness in a way that is safe, environmentally friendly, and efficient. The project will have \nthe following outcome: more efficient and safer movement of goods and people between Bago \nand Kyaikto along the GMS EWEC.11  \n \n16. \nOutput  1:  New  Bago\u2013Kyaikto  expressway  constructed.  The  project  will  construct \nabout  64  km  of  four-lane  expressway  between  Bago  and  Kyaikto.  The  new  expressway  will \nprovide an alternate route between Bago and Kyaikto, shortening the current distance by 32 km \nand  simultaneously  providing  climate-resilient  access  for  this  flood-prone  area.  The  proposed \nexpressway is also the first greenfield expressway in Myanmar and will be fully access controlled. \nA  2.3  km  New  Sittaung  Bridge  across  the  Sittaung  River  is  proposed to  be  constructed  under \nJICA\u2019s  parallel  cofinancing  loan,  not  administered  by  ADB.12 The  construction  supervision  and \nimplementation  support  (CSIS)  consultant  to  be  financed  by  ADB  will  help  the  Department  of \nHighways under the MOC and the project management unit (PMU) implement the project. \n\n \n\n10 ADB.  2019.

This output will focus on developing and implementing a new scheme for expressway \nand toll road management for the MOC.13 The CSIS consultant will propose (i) routine, periodic, \nand  emergency  maintenance  activities  for  a  sustainable  road  asset  management  and  (ii) \nenhanced concession arrangements for O&M. The project will be used as a demonstration case, \nto be scaled up for the country\u2019s highway network managed by the MOC. With ongoing OPPP \nsupport,  possible  schemes  for  wider  private  sector  financing  (i.e.,  capital  investment)  will  be \npursued.14 \n \n18. \nOutput 3: Road safety for Bago\u2013Kyaikto corridor improved. This output will focus on \nimproving safety along the project corridor, building on the road safety program being finalized \nunder  an  ongoing  technical  assistance  (TA)  that  focuses  on  establishing  a  foundation  for  a \nsustainable  road  safety  regime  for  Myanmar.  This  output  will  (i)  implement  an  innovative \ncommunity-based road safety program, focusing on road user education and social enforcement \nto achieve a sustainable long-term safe environment for road users and the local community; (ii) \ninclude the essential road safety engineering elements in the detailed design; and (iii) implement \ninnovative safety measures (see Box in para. 20) during construction phase together with road \nsafety education for consultants and contractors. Equipment necessary for the MOC to improve \nroad safety will be procured under the project.15  \n \nC. \n \n19. \nSince 2012, transport has been a main pillar of ADB\u2019s reengagement strategy in Myanmar. \nADB\u2019s strategy has focused on the GMS corridors and on rural\u2013urban links.16 ADB has financed \nroad improvement projects in the Ayeyarwady delta and on the Eindu\u2013Kawkareik section of the \nEWEC.17 ADB has also prepared a strategic review of the transport sector and provided TA to \nreform sector institutions and build their capacity in road asset management and safety.18 It also \nprovided assistance to prepare the National Strategy for Rural Roads and Access (footnote 9). \nCurrently, through its Office of Public-Private Partnership (OPPP), ADB is supporting the MOC \nwith its public\u2013private partnership (PPP) capacity, including designing more effective concession \narrangements. As a result, the MOC has initiated application of road asset management tools in \nthe  DOH,  while  the  Ministry  of  Transport  and  Communications  has  implemented  its  Myanmar \nrailways reform agenda in its first project for ADB financing.19 ADB is also supporting the MOC to \nincrease private sector participation in sustainable O&M activities, through assistance in drafting \nconcession agreements with sustainability objectives.20 \n \n\nValue Added by ADB \n\n \n\n13 ADB. 2016.

Technical Assistance to the Republic of the Union of Myanmar for Strengthening Project Preparation \n\nCapacity in Asia and the Pacific. Manila. \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\f \n\nThe government has requested ADB\u2019s further assistance in developing the country\u2019s main \n20. \nroad corridors, particularly the EWEC, and improve their management. As the first response, in \n2018, ADB approved the GMS Highway Modernization Project to address traffic demand up to \n2025.21 The GMS Highway Modernization Project included the preparation and rehabilitation of \nthe  Yangon\u2013Pathein  and  Bago\u2013Thilawa  sections  of  the  EWEC,  which  were  in  poor  condition. \nADB also approved a rural roads project in 2019, which will allow rural residents in Ayeyarwady \nand  Magway  regions  to  use  a  national  highway  year-round. 22 With  the  long-term  vision  and \nrelationship with the government, it has requested ADB to support this first greenfield expressway \nin Myanmar. The design fully takes into account the government\u2019s lack of experience (para. 5) \nand has drawn from ADB\u2019s experience in other Asian countries, including expressway projects in \nViet Nam, and builds on the policy dialogue between ADB and the government on the transport \nsector, together with PPP capacity-building activity for the MOC through ADB\u2019s OPPP.23 24 The \nproject will also generate a synergy with a proposed GMS: Cross-Border Livestock Health and \nValue  Chains  Improvement  Project,  now  under  preparation.  The  noteworthy  features  of  the \nproject are summarized below. \n \n\nBox: Noteworthy Features of the Project \n\u2022  The  project  areas  have  higher  poverty  incidence  31%  than  the  national  average  24%,  with  a \npopulation density of 146 persons per square km almost twice as high as the national level of 76. \nThe project during construction as well as during its life will bring highly pro-poor benefits. \n\n\u2022  Myanmar will be able to deepen its share in the agriculture and other value chains, of average 23% \nof annual GDP, through greater regional trade broadly in GMS and particularly between Myanmar \nand Thailand, about $3 billion in 2019 with expected yearly average increase of 40%. \n\n\u2022  With traffic demand forecast to rise sharply, as seen over 3-fold increase between 2012\u20132018, there \nwill be a serious deterioration of the traffic environment. The project will address these issues by \nconstructing the access-controlled expressway that meets quality infrastructure principles, including \nclimate resilience and introducing noise barriers and 102 underpasses to ensure residents\u2019 mobility. \n\u2022  Construction methods that are new to Myanmar (for example, Incremental Loading Method) will be \n\npursued for soft-soil treatment, which will also enhance climate resilience. \n\n\u2022  Road safety will be of paramount concern and focus, with third worst fatality rate in southeast Asia, \nintroducing real-time surveillance and emergency response systems. More women (at least 50%) \nwill be involved in and benefit from road safety awareness training. \n\n\u2022  With the expected spike in trade and logistics promotion, as shown above, it is vital to improve asset \n\nmanagement capacity\u2014another focus area of the project. \n\n\u2022  Project aims to propose a sustainable O&M model for toll highways for the MOC to increase private \nsector participation, including possible PPP arrangements, which are also replicable for ongoing toll \nroad concession agreements. Secured toll booths will be built.  \n\nSummary Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n\n \nD. \n \n21. \nThe project is estimated to cost $526.3 million (Table 2). The government has requested \na concessional loan of $483.8 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources to help finance the \nproject, of which $50.0 million is provided from the regional set-aside. The government will provide \nthe equivalent of $42.5 million to finance interest during construction and resettlement. The loan \nwill have a 32-year term, including a grace period of 8 years; an interest rate of 1.0% per year \n\n \n\n21 ADB. 2018.

Appropriate  measures  have  been  identified  to  improve  climate  and  disaster \nresilience  (para.  40).  Pavement  structures  of  the  proposed  four-lane  expressway  have  been \nselected to enable a 10-year useful life for asphalt concrete, with 100-year flood (a flood with a \n100  year  frequency)  applied  for  all  river  crossings  and  for  all  major  drainage  structures.  The \nunderlying traffic projection is based on present traffic volumes, with growth rates that consider \nthe  likely  rapid  increase  in  traffic  expected  as  Myanmar\u2019s  economy  continues  to  develop.  All \nmaterials  used  in  road  construction  are  locally  procured  except  for  bitumen,  road  signs,  road \nfurniture, noise barriers, and reinforcement steel in concrete. \n \nB. \n \n26. \nEconomic viability. The project is economically viable. The main benefits of the project \nunder output 1 are reduced vehicle operating costs and shorter travel times. The project will also \nlikely  generate  road  safety  cost  savings  under  output  3.  The  overall  economic  internal  rate  of \nreturn of the project is estimated to be 14.9%.25 In addition, as a part of the GMS EWEC, the \nproject provides one of the last-mile transport links to Thailand, with expected increased trade in \ngoods, tourism, and investment. \n \nFinancial viability. It is anticipated that with a new O&M scheme to be implemented under \n27. \noutput 2, the project will generate revenue from revised tariffs and increased traffic volumes. The \nrevenue, however, is expected not to be sufficient to cover the significant capital investments, and \nboth the financial net present value (NPV) and financial internal rate of return for the project are \nnegative.  But  the  NPV  during  the  O&M  period  is  still  greater  than  the  total  O&M  costs  of  the \n\nEconomic and Financial Viability \n\n25 This takes into consideration the New Sittaung Bridge, to be financed by JICA\u2019s parallel cofinancing loan. \n\n \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\f \n\nGovernance \n\nSustainability \n\nproject, which suggests that the minimum conditions for operational and financial sustainability \nare achievable with an enhanced expressway O&M scheme. This new O&M scheme will be a \nPPP  structured  to  ensure  financial  sustainability.  ADB  is  also  supporting  the  MOC\u2019s  efforts  to \nsecure private sector participation for sustainable O&M activities, including the draft of concession \nagreements. \n \nC. \n \nUnder  MOC\u2019s  current  O&M  scheme,  the  sustainability  of  the  project  would  depend  on \n28. \ngeneral  budget  appropriations  for  road  maintenance,  which  are  for  those  roads  not  under \nconcessions. The DOH receives fiscal allocations of about $125 million annually from the central \nand  regional  governments  for  road  O&M.  This  allocation  is  considered  sufficient  to  maintain \ncurrent road and traffic conditions; however, there is a risk of an increased maintenance backlog. \nStrengthening the capacity of the MOC as an institution which operates the wider road network in \nMyanmar and enhancing the expressway and toll road management scheme, including revising \nand  updating  toll  fees,  are  critical  to  support  the  long-term  operational  efficiency  and  financial \nsustainability of the new project expressway. \n \nD. \n \n29. \nProcurement.  Strategic  procurement  planning  was  carried  out  to  identify  procurement \nrisks,  develop  mitigating  measures,  review  procurement  options,  and  agree  on  fit-for-purpose \nprocurement arrangements. The procurement risk is rated high since the DOH lacks capability \nand  will  depend  on  international  consultants  for  the  preparation  of  the  detailed  design, \nprocurement, and project implementation support. The capacity development in procurement will \nbe provided by the consultant through day-to-day assistance and trainings. Value for money will \nbe achieved by (i) selecting the CSIS consultant through advance action under the quality- and \ncost-based selection method with 90% weight assigned to quality; and (ii) procuring the civil works \npackage through open competitive bidding, where one civil works contract is split into five lots, \ntaking into account engineering considerations and the size and complexity of road sections, and \nwhere bidders are permitted to bid for a single lot or combination of lots based on their technical \ncapacity and availability of financial resources. \n \n30. \nInstitutional  capacity.  The  procurement  management  risk  is  rated  high.  Although  the \nDOH  has  made  progress,  it  is  still  dependent  on  international  consultants  for  implementation \nsupport for ongoing projects. Capacity development will be continued under the proposed project \nwith  consultant  support,  initially  through  day-to-day  assistance  and  trainings.  In  parallel  to  the \nproject,  ADB  will  strengthen  the  DOH\u2019s  capacity  in  safeguards,  procurement,  and  contract \nmanagement through day-to-day assistance and capacity-building workshops. \n \n31. \nFinancial  management.  The  premitigation  financial  management  risk  is  substantial, \nmainly because of weaknesses in government-wide financial management systems and limited \ncapacity of the DOH in financial reporting, and internal audit. Through the strengthened PMU, the \nDOH  will  manage  project  financial  management  arrangements,  including  implementation  of \nproject-specific financial management actions to mitigate the risks. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy \n(1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed with the government and the MOC. \nThe specific policy requirements, proposed risk mitigating actions, and supplementary measures \nare described in the project administration manual. 26 \n \nE. \n \n\nPoverty, Social, and Gender \n\n26 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\nPoverty. The average poverty rate of four townships (Bago, Waw, Thanatpin, and Kyaikto) \n32. \nclose to the proposed road is 31.0%, higher than the national average of 24.8% for Myanmar in \n2017.27 While the average national poverty rate fell significantly from 32.1% in 2015 to 24.8% in \n2017, the decline in poverty rate in the project areas was marginal in the same period. The total \nnumber of households that will be directly benefited by the project is estimated to be 13,100 with \nabout 69,000 people, 52% of whom are women. The new road will halve the travel time (currently \n110  minutes)  between  Bago  and  Kyaikto,  facilitate  the  transport  of  commodities,  and  promote \neconomic development of the project states and GMS. Further, direct poverty alleviation benefits \nof  the  project  are  expected  to  derive  from  improved  access  to  services  (such  as  health  and \neducation), employment  opportunities,  and  markets.  Indirect  poverty  alleviation  will  result  from \nthe project\u2019s contribution to economic development through lower transport costs resulting from \nreduced travel times and vehicle operating costs. \n \nGender.  The  project  is  categorized  as  having  some  gender  elements  for  gender \n33. \nmainstreaming.  A gender action plan was prepared to identify  specific programs and activities \nwhere  participation  of  women  can  be  promoted. 28 The  project  will  address  marginalization  of \nwomen in training through specific targets for women in project training activities. For villages in \nthe  project  areas,  participation  of  women  will  be  actively  promoted  in  consultation  activities, \nHIV/AIDS, and the Human Trafficking Awareness and Prevention Program (footnote 26), as well \nas livelihood restoration activities for households affected by land acquisition. The participation of \nwomen  in  capacity  development  programs  in  government  agencies  responsible  for  project \nimplementation  and  operation  will  also  be  ensured  through  targets  in  training  for  project \nmanagement and crash data collection and analysis provided under outputs 1 and 3. The project \nwill also mitigate risks to women posed during the construction period. Risks of sexual harassment \nand  gender-based  violence  will  be  reduced  through  grievance  redress  mechanisms  that  are \naccessible  and  oriented  towards  women,  as  well  as  public  awareness  campaigns  on  what \nconstitutes gender-based violence and sexual harassment and where women can go for support. \n \n34. \nHIV/AIDS  and  human  trafficking.  The  project  could  face  increased  risks  of  HIV/AIDS \nand sexually transmitted infections as well as human trafficking. The risks are associated with the \nconstruction phase as a result of the influx of construction workers and camp followers (including \nsex workers) and low levels of awareness of risk prevention, as well as during the operation phase \nof the completed project because of increased mobility. To mitigate these risks, the project will \nimplement  the  Human  Trafficking  Awareness  and  Prevention  Program.  The  program  will  be \nimplemented by a service provider under the CSIS consultant. The main activities of the program \nwill  include  (i)  raising  awareness  of  local  communities  and  high-risk  groups  using  behavioral \nchange communication, (ii) improving access to medical services, (iii) raising the capacities of the \nstakeholders, and (iv) mobilizing local peer educators. The civil works contractors will be required \nto provide HIV/AIDS awareness and prevention training for their workers. \n \n35. \nSafe working under COVID-19 conditions. The impact of COVID-19 is evolving, and the \nimplementation of the project will be responsive and flexible in meeting emerging needs and new \nguidance.  The  project  will  strictly  follow  government  guidance  on  safe  working  in  COVID-19 \nconditions, adhering to the most robust medical and scientific advice. The project parties will be \nrequired  to  incorporate  emerging  international  construction  best  practice  on  distancing  (where \npractical  for  works  of  this  nature),  implementation  methodologies,  effective  use  of  forced  air \nventilation systems, and personal protective equipment.

None  of  the  project  areas are  directly conflict  affected. \n36. \nThe  project  will  benefit  all  communities  in  a  fair,  unbiased,  and  equal  manner.  Improving  the \ntransport connectivity along the GMS EWEC will increase employment and income opportunities \nin the project areas, states and regions along the EWEC including Kayin state,  as well as in other \nparts of the country through increased trade and business activities, which in turn could foster \ngrowth and reduce poverty.29 \n \nF. \n \n37. \ncategories are as follows.30 \n \n38. \nEnvironment  (category  A).  An  environmental  impact  assessment  (EIA)  was  prepared \nand  uploaded  to  the  ADB  website  on  2  September  2019. 31 The  project  alignment  has  been \nselected to minimize environmental impacts by traversing primarily agricultural land classified as \nhighly modified habitat and avoiding encroachment on legally protected sites. Without mitigation \nmeasures, construction impacts could be significant. Properly licensed quarrying sites will need \nto be identified to source construction materials for the elevated highway embankment. An action \nplan  has  been  prepared  to  address  possible  adverse  impacts  on  biodiversity,  primarily  the \ncatastrophic loss of containment, and reduce pollution during the construction and operation of \nthe  New  Sittaung  Bridge,  which  could  affect  water  quality  of  the  Sittaung  River  and  the \ndownstream  Gulf  of  Mottama  Ramsar  site. 32  Other  anticipated  impacts  during  construction \ninclude  fugitive  dust,  temporary  traffic  disturbance,  and  occupational  and  community  safety  at \nconstruction  sites.  Adherence  to  the  environmental  management  plan  will  reduce  the  residual \nimpact to acceptable levels. During operations, the project\u2019s impact on ambient air quality is not \nanticipated to be significant, but around 10 km of noise barriers at 19 identified sensitive sites will \nbe required. \n \n39. \nTraffic safety will be strengthened through a community-based road safety program (para. \n18). The capacity of the PMU, responsible for overseeing the implementation of the environmental \nmanagement plan, will be strengthened with new environment staff, supervision consultants, and \nan independent environmental monitor. Meaningful public consultation was carried out during the \nEIA preparation to inform the project design and environmental assessment process. A grievance \nredress mechanism has also been defined. \n \n40. \nThe  project  is  classified  as  having  a  medium  climate  risk,  mainly  an  increase  in \nprecipitation and floods.33 Climate adaptation is estimated to cost $10.7 million, mainly to address \nclimate-sensitive  facilities,  including  road  embankments,  bridges  and  underpasses,  and  road \ndrainage facilities. \n \n41. \nInvoluntary  resettlement  (category  A)  and  indigenous  peoples  (category  B).  The \nproject  has  been  categorized  A  for  involuntary  resettlement  and  B  for  indigenous  peoples  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009).

Safeguard Categories. \n31 Environmental Impact Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). An updated EIA, \nreflecting comments received from the Environment Conservation Department of Myanmar, was disclosed in April \n2020. \n\n32 The New Sittaung Bridge to be financed by JICA\u2019s non-ADB-administered parallel cofinancing will be classified as \nan associated facility per ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) and has been assessed through a separate EIA. \nKey findings of the New Sittaung Bridge EIA are reflected in the EIA of the proposed project (accessible from the list \nof linked documents in Appendix 2). A Ramsar site is a wetland site assessed as internationally significant under the \nRamsar Convention established by UNESCO. \n\n33 Climate Change Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n\f12 \n\n \n\ninvoluntary resettlement impacts were assessed, and a resettlement plan has been prepared.34 \nThe project requires acquisition of 502.79 hectares (ha) of land (442.54 ha of private land and \n60.25 ha of state land). The project will affect 447 households (2,441 people), out of which 32 \nhouseholds are non-titleholders living within the existing MOC right-of-way. The project requires \nrelocation of 64 households (306 people). \n \n42. \nIn addition to the resettlement plan, a separate ethnic group development plan (EGDP) \nhas been prepared. No ethnic group households will be affected by land acquisition or experience \nother  severe  impacts.  The  EGDP  ensures  that  ethnic  groups  in  the  project  areas  (about  2%) \nparticipate equitably in consultations and benefit from mitigation programs and project benefits. \nThe DOH will implement the EGDP with the support of the CSIS consultants. The EGDP and the \nresettlement plan have been endorsed by the DOH for public disclosure on the ADB website. \n \nADB  has  discussed  with  JICA  the  effective  harmonization  of  safeguards  policies, \n43. \nprovisions, specific resettlement entitlements, and unit costs for compensation. It is agreed that \nthe DOH will ensure consistency of compensation provisions for both JICA- and ADB-financed \nproject facilities. ADB has clarified with the DOH that the income restoration strategy, set out in \nthe  resettlement  plan,  is  mandatory.  This  will  ensure  that  the  livelihoods  of  severely  affected \nhouseholds  will  be  fully  restored.  The  income  restoration  program  is  to  be  implemented  by  a \nspecialized local agency. \n \nG. \n \n44. \ndetail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.35 \n \n\nSignificant  risks  and  mitigating  measures  are  summarized  in  Table  5  and  described  in \n\nSummary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n\nTable 5: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nRisks \n\nInitial  project  start-up  delays  (such  as  consultant \nin  project \nselection,  and  contract  awards)  occur \nimplementation. \n\nThe military unexpectedly occupies private land along the \nalignment. \n\nWeak  government  capacity  in  procurement,  contract \nmanagement,  financial  management,  and  safeguards \ncompliance affects project implementation progress. \n\nExtreme  weather  events  delay  civil  works  or  require  an \nincrease  in  the  scope  of  works  and  COVID-19  impacts \nadversely on the contractor\u2019s workforce, subcontractors, \nsuppliers,  consultants,  government  and  ADB  staff,  and \ngeneral public (particularly vulnerable people). \n\nMitigation Measures \n\nThe  recruitment  of  CSIS  consultant  has  been  initiated \nunder advance action before loan negotiations. \n\nBased on the alignment finalized in August 2019, the MOC \nhas initiated and engaged in the lengthy process to freeze \naffected land (ongoing). \n\nThe  proposed  project  will  minimize \nthe  number  of \ncontracts, set up project FM system, and strengthen PMU \ncapacity  through  training  and  day-to-day  assistance  by \nCSIS consultant and ADB. \n\nFor  weather  events,  status  will  be  closely  monitored  and \nthe CSIS consultants may be required to design additional \nworks. For COVID-19 impacts, the contractor will maintain \nvigilance in the management of health risks in all siteworks \nfor  a  safe  working  environment,  including  adjacent  areas \nfor the general public. Health and safety protocols will be \nenforced  for  working  in  trenches  and  other  confined \nspaces. \n\nNew  uncontrolled  settlements  along  corridors  reduce \nsafety. \n\nAccess  control  measures  will  be  implemented  with  no \nloopholes for entry. \n\nfails \n\nto  execute  an  expressway \nThe  government \nmanagement scheme for the Bago\u2013Kyaikto expressway, \nfor  operation  and \nand \nmaintenance falls below minimum requirements. \n\nthe  government\u2019s  budget \n\nThe proposed project will support the DOH in developing \nand implementing a new expressway operation (including \nrevising  and  updating  toll  fees)  and  a  maintenance \nmanagement scheme. \n\n34 Resettlement Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n35 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n \n\n\f13 \n\nRisks \n\nMitigation Measures \n\nreports  become  not \n\nFinancial \nreliable.  Financial \nmanagement  performance  rating  becomes  low  because \nof delays in annual accounts submission and acceptance. \n\nThe  DOH  will  prepare  and  implement  an  information \ntechnology  improvement  strategy  for  finance  units.  It  will \nalso  use  a  simple  application  for  project  reporting  (to  be \nverified by internal audit annually) at the initial stage. \n\nWeak government PFM system leads to inadequate and \ndelayed counterpart financing. Project financial reporting \nand  audit  are  performed  according  to  standards  not \nacceptable to ADB. \n\nADB  will  continue  providing \ntechnical  support  and \nundertaking policy initiatives to address systemic financial \nmanagement issues to strengthen the government\u2019s PFM \nsystem and procedures. \n\nAbsence of internal control function in the DOH and weak \naccounting  and  reporting  procedures  lead  to  risk  of \nerroneous  and  fraudulent  financial  data  and  misuse  of \nproject  funds  and  assets;  delay  in  project  financial \nreporting (quarterly progress reports and annual audited \nproject  financial  statements  submissions);  and  delay  in \nmanagement  information  on  project  performance  (cost \noverruns, disbursement and/or payment requirements). \n\nExternal  auditor\u2019s  opinions  provided  on  project  financial \nstatements are not in line with ADB requirements. There \nis no independent assurance on the use of loan proceeds. \n\nWeak  capacity  of  the  government  in  procurement  and \ncontract management leads to less qualified contractors \nand construction delays. \n\nThe CSIS consultants will develop project-specific financial \nmanagement manual for the PMU, covering internal audit, \ninternal  control,  reporting  requirements,  and  information \nsystems (Microsoft Excel models); assignment of qualified \nfinance  staff  (from  existing  Accounting  and  Finance \nSection unit of the DOH) to perform regular internal audit \nactivities. \n\nDevelop  (i)  comprehensive  requirements  for  external \nauditor and (ii) tools for monitoring the implementation of \naudit  recommendations  to  be  reviewed  and  agreed  by \nADB. \n\nfinancial  capability,  and  maximizing \n\nThe MOC will select the appropriate number of civil works \ncontracts, taking into account engineering considerations, \ncontractor\u2019s \nthe \ntypes  of \ncompetitiveness  of  procurement.
