I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto Armenia for additional financing for the Water Supply and Sanitation Sector Project.1  \n \n2.  The additional financing will (i) rehabilitate and upgrade water supply infrastructure, (ii) \nimprove the performance of water services, and (iii) improve the management and operational \nefficiency of the water utility company.2 Also, the additional financing will ensure further public \nhealth  and  environmental  improvements  by  providing  potable  and  reliable  water  supply  to \nhouseholds in approximately 18 towns and 92 villages in the provinces of Aragatsotn, Ararat, \nAmavir,  Geharqunik,  Tavush,  Lori,  Kotayq,  Shirak,  Syunik,  and  Vayotz-Dzor.  The  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  loan  will  form  part  of  a  larger  sector  capital  investment  by  the \ngovernment of Armenia and other international financial institutions including the World Bank \nand the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  The government has been systemically facilitating improvements in the water supply and \nsanitation (WSS) sector through significant legislative and institutional reforms, notably the \nadoption of (i) the Water Code of Armenia in 2002 to promote water allocation based on water \nresource supply, (ii) the Law on Fundamental Provisions of the National Water Policy in 2005 for \nthe strategic use and protection of water resources and systems, and (iii) the National Water \nProgram in 2006 to address water resource formation and sustainability. \n \n4.  In October 2007, ADB approved funding for the Water Supply and Sanitation Sector \nProject to upgrade and rehabilitate WSS systems in 18 subprojects  in 16 towns and 125 \nvillages.3 The  current  project  had  two  components:  (i)  infrastructure  rehabilitation,  and  (ii) \nimprovements in management and operational efficiency. The current project is expected to be \ncompleted in the first quarter of 2012, which is 12 months ahead of schedule. \n \n5.  Foreseeing the likely success of the current project, the government has requested \nthrough the State Committee for Water Economy (SCWE) that ADB further fund the additional \nfinancing  and  support  the  government\u2019s  continued  efforts  to  rehabilitate  and  extend  WSS \nsystems with an additional 10 subprojects and further improve the operational efficiency and \nfinancial management of the Armenia Water and Sewerage Company (AWSC), a government-\nowned  commercial  company  that  Soci\u00e9t\u00e9  d'Am\u00e9nagement  Urbain  et  Rural  (SAUR),  an \ninternational water utility, manages and operates through a management contract. \n \n6.  The  additional  financing  is  included  in  the  country  operational  business  plan4 and \nstrongly supports the government\u2019s objective of facilitating human development through better \naccess to reliable and sustainable supplies of potable water, improving living conditions in \napproximately 18 towns and 92 villages in Armenia. \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2007. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Loan to the \nRepublic of Armenia for the Water Supply and Sanitation Sector Project. Manila (Loan 2363-ARM, for $36 million, \napproved on 31 October). \n2  The revised design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n3  The current project was designed and approved by ADB\u2019s Board of Directors in 2007 to  serve 16 towns and 125 \nvillages. The review in October 2011 reported the project serving 21 towns and 97 villages. \n4  ADB. 2011. Country Operations Business Plan: Armenia, 2012\u20132013. Manila. ", "2 \nB.  Progress and Performance of the Current Project \n \n7.  Project performance. The progress and implementation of the current project is on \ntrack. The AWSC has effectively managed and coordinated the various contract packages for \nthe current project and the overall operation of the company. The recent progress report5 by \nAWSC and by ADB6 report the current project having delivered the key results discussed below. \n \n8.  Component A. Construction completion is 12 months ahead of schedule.7 More towns \nhave been covered which resulted in 24,000 additional beneficiaries with safe and reliable \nwater. Water supply and sewerage systems in 21 towns and 97 villages were rehabilitated or \nreplaced. In terms of outcomes in the design and monitoring framework, the current project has \nimproved access to reliable supplies of potable water for 600,000 people, which exceeds the \nbaseline target of 576,000 people. \n \n9.  All 40 civil works contracts have been awarded, with 33 completed and the remainder \neither ongoing or close to completion. The project had disbursed $33 million of its $36 million as \nof the third quarter of 2011. More than 450 kilometers of water pipes and 17,500 water meters \nwere installed from 2008 to 2010. The number of consumers receiving 24-hour water supply \nincreased by 46% from 2008 to 2010.8 \n \n10.  Component B. Improvements in service delivery are reflected in public satisfaction rates \nrising to 66% in 2010 from 42% in 2008. Tariff collection significantly increased from 61% in \n2008  to  74%  in  2010.  Financial  management  improved  through  the  introduction  of  new \naccounting procedures, a computerized billing and collection system, and a system of mapping \nasset inventories. These results meet project targets as set out in outputs 3 and 4 of the design \nand monitoring framework with regard to improvements in AWSC\u2019s operational capacity and \ncommunity management. The exception is nonrevenue water, which has not improved during \nimplementation. \n \n11.  Environment  and  social  safeguards  compliance.  All  subprojects  for  the  current \nproject  have  been  prepared,  appraised,  and  implemented  in  accordance  with  the  agreed \nenvironmental assessment and review procedure. The AWSC has screened each approved \nsubproject  for  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  effects.  No  indigenous  people  have  been \naffected or involved in any of the subprojects. \n \n12.  Management  of  risks.  Risks  identified  at  appraisal  have,  for  the  most  part,  been \nmanaged appropriately and so far none has affected project implementation. Anticipated delays \ncaused by procurement issues did not materialize. The AWSC project team received detailed \norientation  on  ADB\u2019s  Procurement Guidelines (2010,  as  amended from time  to time),  and \nadvance procurement facilitated the early engagement of potential contractors. \n \n13.  During current project implementation, public outreach increased community awareness \nof project effects and benefits, which improved community involvement and support for the \ncurrent project. \n \n                                                \n5  AWSC. 2011.

Manila. \n7  Original completion date is 30 June 2013 and the expected completion date is 30 June 2012. \n8  Additional information on other project targets and indicators is in the Summary of Project Performance (accessible \nfrom the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "3 \n14.  However, further action is needed with regard to tariff reform. A recent assessment9 by \nthe World Bank suggests that the existing tariff is sufficient to cover only the costs of operation \nand emergency and routine maintenance but not of preventative maintenance, replacement, \nand system expansion. Tariff reform is a provision under the ADB loan for the current project. \nTariff reform is critical to the long-term financial viability of water operators, so a tariff plan10 has \nbeen included as a loan provision under additional financing. \n \nC.  Project\u2019s Eligibility for Additional Financing \n \n15.  The additional financing meets the eligibility criteria in ADB\u2019s additional financing policy11 \nbecause the overall project remains technically feasible, economically viable, and financially \nsound. The government accords the additional financing high priority, and it is consistent with \nthe overall project\u2019s development objectives and the current country operations and business \nplan (footnote 4). \n \n16.  Additional financing will support the continuation of the current project to the next phase \nand expand outcomes to benefit more households living in 8 additional project towns12 and \napproximately 63 additional project villages in Armenia through better access to water supply \nthat is safe, reliable, and sustainable. \n \nD.  Impact and Outcome \n \n17.  The overall project\u2019s revised impact and outcome will expand project benefits in terms of \ninfrastructure rehabilitation, water service improvements, and operational efficiency and improve \npublic health and the environment in 29 towns and 160 villages, which includes 8 towns and 63 \nvillages13 not  covered  by the  current  project,  through  safe, reliable,  and  sustainable  water \nsupply.  The  government  is  expected  to  continue  to  implement  institutional  and  legislative \nreforms to help the AWSC enhance its management capacity and operational efficiency. \n \n18.  The  overall  project  will  reduce  poverty  by  (i) reducing  the  incidence of  waterborne \ndisease and cost of medical care, (ii) allowing women to spend less time collecting water and \nmore time participating in social and economic activities, (iii) providing safer and more reliable \nwater supply, and (iv) improving the quality of life in all project towns and villages. \n \nE.  Outputs \n \n19.  As with the current project, the additional financing will (i) rehabilitate and upgrade water \nsupply  infrastructure,  (ii)  improve  the  performance  of  water  services,  and  (iii)  improve  the \nmanagement and operational efficiency of the water utility company. \n \n20.  Municipal  infrastructure  rehabilitation  and  improvement. This will rehabilitate or \nreplace  existing  water  supply  infrastructure.  Works  will  include  the  construction  of  600 \nkilometers of new mains and pipe networks to connect 110,000 new and existing customers; the \nrehabilitation of about 5 pumping stations, about 3 chlorination stations, 1 water treatment plant, \nand about 15 daily regulation reservoirs; and the installation of water meters on the premises of \n                                                \n9  World Bank. 2011.

Further, this component will redesign water \nsupply systems. \n \n 21.  Management improvement and capacity development. This will further improve the \noperational and management efficiency of the AWSC by (i) increasing public awareness of \nmunicipal infrastructure rehabilitation and improvement through public awareness and media \ncampaigns, (ii) strengthening service contracts between the AWSC and municipal governments \ngoverning  the  use  of  locally  owned  distribution  networks  and  the  contracts  between  the \ncompany and communities taking bulk water supply, (iii) developing a disconnection policy for \nnonpayers, and (iv) preparing a strategy to develop the AWSC\u2019s human resources by improving \nstaff training and development. \n \nF.  Investment and Financing Plans \n \n22.

The  government  has  requested  a  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to \nSDR25,886,000  (equivalent  to  $40,000,000)  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources  to  help \nfinance the additional financing. The loan will have a 32-year term, including a grace period of 8 \nyears;  an  interest  rate of 1.0% per  annum  during the grace  period  and  1.5%  per  annum \nthereafter;  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  set  forth  in  the  draft  loan  and  project \nagreements.

The government will relend funds to the AWSC under a subsidiary loan agreement on \nthe same terms and conditions as the ADB loan. The AWSC will service the loan and bear the \nforeign exchange risk, and the government will finance all the taxes and duties. \n \nG.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n25.  Project management. The SCWE will again be the executing agency for the additional \nfinancing,  coordinate  implementation,  and  establish  the  project  coordination  unit,  which  is \nexpected to be the same unit as for the current project, consisting of two staffers: a project \ncoordinator and an administrative assistant. The project coordination unit will coordinate closely \nwith ADB, the project management unit (PMU), and government agencies. The AWSC will again \nbe the implementing agency and coordinate additional financing implementation with the PMU. \nIt is expected that the PMU under the current project will take on the same responsibilities for \nthe additional financing with a staff of about 14. The PMU will be headed by a project manager \nand  staffed  by  an  engineer  and/or  technical  specialist,  a  social  safeguard  specialist,  a \nprocurement specialist, a finance and accounting specialist, and support staff. \n \n26.  Implementation  period. The additional financing will be implemented over 5 years \ncommencing in May 2012. The implementation of the current project was also 5 years, but the \nstrong performance of the AWSC has the current project now scheduled for completion 12 \nmonths ahead of schedule. \n \n27.  Management  contract.  The  AWSC  is  currently  managed  and  operated  under  a \nmanagement contract with SAUR, a private international provider of water and wastewater \nservices. The management contract with SAUR was recently extended for an additional 2 years \nto the end of 2013. \n \n28.  Advance  contracting  and  retroactive  financing.  To  facilitate  additional  financing \npreparation,  the  AWSC  has  requested  advance  contracting  and  retroactive  financing  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to \ntime)  with  respect  to  consulting  packages  for  technical  design,  construction  supervision, \ncapacity  building,  and  public  awareness  campaigns.  Any  concurrence  by  ADB  regarding \nprocedures, documentation, or proposals for awarding contract does not commit ADB to finance \nany such additional financing expenditures. \n \n29.  Procurement. Procurement financed under the additional financing will accord with ADB \nProcurement Guidelines. The procurement plan is in the project administration manual.14 \n \n                                                \n14 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "6 \n30.  Disbursement  arrangements. Loan proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2007, as amended from time to time). The PMU in the \nAWSC,  as  implementing  agency,  will  establish,  maintain,  and  manage  a  separate  imprest \naccount  after  loan  effectiveness.  The  advance  under  the  imprest  account  will  not  exceed \nestimated eligible expenditures for the next 6 months, or 10% of the loan amount, whichever is \nlower. The statement of expenditures procedure may be used to reimburse eligible expenditures \nand liquidate the advance into the imprest account; any individual payment to be reimbursed or \nliquidated under the procedure will not exceed the equivalent of $100,000. \n \n31.  Project performance management and evaluation. As with the current project, a list \nof  performance  indicators  will  be  tracked  and  evaluated  under  a  project  performance \nmanagement system. The project performance management system will monitor and track the \ntechnical  performance  of  the  additional  financing  and,  at  the  same  time,  the  additional \nfinancing\u2019s  social,  gender,  and  economic  benefits,  in  particular  for  the  poor  and  women. \nBaseline data and performance targets will have to be established at project commencement, \nand performance indicators will be monitored and reported to ADB through quarterly progress \nreports. \n \n32.  Project review. Review missions will be undertaken twice a year in the first 2 years and \nthereafter once a year. The review will evaluate the scope, implementation arrangements, and \nperformance of additional financing components. A staff consultant may be required for project \nreviews. \n \n33.  Subproject  selection,  preparation,  and  appraisal.  Subprojects  will  be  selected \nsimilarly as for the current project, following these basic criteria: (i) The subproject is consistent \nwith the government\u2019s sector policies, development objectives, and development strategy. (ii) \nThe existing water supply network and equipment are dilapidated, broken down, and operating \ninefficiently, causing water supply shortages and environmental problems. (iii) The subproject is \ntechnically feasible and economically and financially viable. (iv) It complies with ADB safeguard \npolicies and has no significant  adverse social and/or environmental impacts. (v) It can be \ncompleted within the additional financing implementation period. \n \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nImplementation period  May  2012\u2013May 2017 \nEstimated completion date  May  2017 \nManagement \n(i)   Oversight body  State Committee for Water Economy \n(ii)   Executing agency  State Committee for Water Economy \n(iii)  Key implementing agency  Armenia Water and Sewerage Company \n(iv)  Implementation unit  Yerevan, 16 staff (14 in the project management unit, 2 in the project coordination \nunit) \nProcurement a  International competitive  18 contracts  $42.10 million \nbidding (ICB) (civil works)a    including taxes \nNational competitive bidding  20 contracts  and duties \n(civil works)a \nICB (goods)  2 contracts  $2.18 million \nShopping  4 contracts  $0.12 million \nConsulting services  Quality- and cost-based  1 contract for detailed design and  $2.64 million \nselection  construction supervision firm (72 \ninternational person-months and \n474 national person-months) \nLeast cost selection  1 contract for financial audit  $0.20 million \n ", "7 \nAdvance contracting and  As noted in para. 26, the Armenia Water and Sewerage Company will commence \nretroactive financing  advance contracting of consultants to undertake detailed design and construction \nsupervision.

DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical  \n \n34.  A preliminary technical assessment has been undertaken by AWSC in-house technical \nexperts and engineers using the same framework as in the detailed design assessment for the \ncurrent project. Six subprojects representative of the 10 subprojects in the additional financing \nwere assessed through (i) a survey of the existing water supply system, (ii) an assessment of \npopulation growth and likely future water demand in project towns and villages, (iii) a preliminary \nwater supply network design, and (iv) a development and investment program for water supply \nsystem improvements. \n \n35.  The assessment highlights the deteriorating state of the water supply systems and the \nneed  to  replace  and  upgrade  corroding  cast  iron  pipes  delivering  non-potable  water  to \ncommunities in project towns and villages. The survey noted several illegal connections to \nmains that cause inefficiencies and system losses. \n \n36.  ADB has engaged an independent water engineer to assess the validity of  project \nassumptions and the viability of the additional financing. The review noted that assumptions in \nthe assessment were reasonable and that contingency arrangements are sufficient to cover any \nunplanned works. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n \n37.  Following ADB\u2019s Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects,15 the financial and \neconomic analyses of the expanded project assess the economic viability of individual outputs \nand of the additional financing and further indicate appropriate tariffs to ensure fair returns on \ncapital and cover operating costs. To determine economic viability, benefits and costs streams \nhave been evaluated with and without the project, allowing estimates of incremental cash flows \nfor each output and their switching values to ascertain robustness. \n \n38.  Economic analyses of the three sample subprojects were undertaken as representative \nof the 10 subprojects in the additional financing. The major economic benefits are cost savings \non non-incremental supply to user households, previously connected and not, and the average \ndemand  price  for  incremental  water  supplies  based  on  user  willingness  to  pay.  The  non-\nincremental benefits are quantified using cost savings from (i) the use of alternative water \nsources; (ii) time saved not collecting water; (iii) non-technical losses; and (iv) savings on \n                                                \n15 ADB. 2007.

Time saved not collecting water and willingness to pay are based on \nhousehold surveys regularly updated by the AWSC and on actual sampling interviews with \nexisting and potential beneficiaries. All of the above were quantified in economic terms. Health \nimpacts that accrue only after several years of system operation were not quantified. The \nanalysis shows the three sample subprojects to be economically viable, with the economic \ninternal rate of return  at 21.0% for the subproject  in Ararat, 19.2% in Lori, and 17.6% in \nGeharqunik, all exceeding the economic opportunity cost of capital of 12%. \n \n39.  Financial analysis assesses the capacity of subprojects to cover future costs for capital \ninvestments, operation, maintenance, and replacement. Analysis with and without the project \nassessed costs and revenues over 25 years. The key financial parameters of sustainability \napplied in the analysis were (i) the financial internal rate of return (FIRR), which should be \nhigher than the weighted average cost of capital; (ii) tariff affordability, generally acceptable at \nup to 5% of average household income; and (iii) positive year-end cash balances. \n \n40.  The results show that the FIRRs for the samples exceed the weighted average cost of \ncapital, estimated at 2.1%, with the subproject in Ararat at 6.5%, Lori at 6.3%, and Geharqunik \nat 4.9%. To assess the sensitivity of the investment to changes in anticipated benefits and/or \ncosts, switching values have been calculated. The FIRRs for individual subprojects range from \n3.1% to 3.3%, showing that project components are financially viable if the proposed water \ntariffs  are  applied,  along  with  corresponding  government  subsidies  where  needed.  The \nswitching values suggest that the estimates are robust  enough to absorb reasonable cost \noverruns, unanticipated decreases in revenue, and delays in project implementation. \n \nC.  Governance \n \n41.  In  the  current  project,  it  was  assessed  that  the  executing  agency  and  the  key \nimplementing agency both satisfy ADB\u2019s financial management requirements and have the \ncapacity to manage procurement, which the latest assessment suggests still holds true. Both \nhave satisfactory financial management capability to (i) record required financial transactions \nand balances, (ii) provide regular and reliable financial statements and monitoring reports, (iii) \nsafeguard the financial assets, and (iv) subject the required financial documents to auditing \nacceptable to ADB. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to \nand discussed with the government and the SCWE. The specific policy requirements and \nsupplementary measures are described in the project administration manual (footnote 14). \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n \n42.  Residents of approximately 18 towns and 92 villages, the majority in rural areas, will \nbenefit  from  improved  water  supply  service,  among  them  the  poor  and  socially  excluded. \nCustomers  in  rural  areas  strongly  support  the  additional  financing,  which  will  significantly \nimprove their living standards and create new employment. The additional financing will improve \nwater-use, hygiene, and sanitation in targeted areas, and will include men and women as \ninformed consumers monitoring service quality. At an institutional level, women will benefit from \nimproved  employment  and  career  opportunities.  A  gender  action  plan16 includes  gender-\nsensitive outreach campaigns especially targeting women to inform them about their customer \n                                                \n16 Phase 1 did not have a gender action plan, but phase 2 will promote effective gender mainstreaming. \n ", "9 \nrights, efficient water use, hygiene and sanitation issues, and how they can claim reliable WSS \nservices.17 \n \nE.  Safeguards \n \n43.  Environment. The additional financing is environmental category B, as its subprojects \nwill not have significant irreversible or permanent negative environmental impacts during or after \nconstruction. According to ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the subprojects require \ninitial environmental examinations (IEEs). As the scale of each operation is small and their \nimpacts will be similar, one framework IEE has been prepared for the entire operation. The \nchecklist provided in the framework IEE shows that site-specific environmental management \nplans (SSEMPs) for each subproject location will be prepared to address all location-specific \nimpacts. The impacts likely to arise from such operations as studied in the IEE are largely \nlimited to construction and can be adequately addressed through the well-designed mitigation \nrecommended  in  the  report  and  further  described  in  the  SSEMPs.  The  SSEMPs  will  be \nprepared by DSC consultants and reviewed by the environment specialist in the AWSC.  Public \nconsultations were held in 10 towns, and each session was attended by groups representing all \nneighboring villages. The IEE was uploaded on ADB\u2019s website on 18 January 2012. \n \n44.  Land acquisition and resettlement. The additional financing is category B (limited \nimpacts)  on  involuntary  land  acquisition  and  resettlement.  The  preliminary  design  shows \nrehabilitation and construction conducted mostly on property owned by the AWSC, on municipal \nland,  or  within  the  rights-of-way  assigned  to  municipal  infrastructure.  Limited  involuntary \nresettlement is envisaged in the removal of moveable assets (i.e., trees and crops) or restricted \naccess to communal lands with its reallocation into a hydraulic facility. A sample resettlement \nplan for one of the subprojects has been prepared. Involuntary resettlement due diligence was \nconducted for the remaining subprojects. Any subsequent subprojects that would require the \nacquisition of private lands will be ineligible for financing under the additional financing. The \napproved resettlement framework of the current project was reviewed and updated for the \nadditional financing. The changes in the updated resettlement framework are (i) replacing ADB\u2019s \nInvoluntary Resettlement Policy (1995) with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement, (ii) restrictions \nto subprojects involving the acquisition of private property or causing significant involuntary \nresettlement, (iii) the provision of land donation procedures following ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy \nStatement requirements on negotiated land acquisition, and (iv) the addition of a few regulations \nrelevant to land acquisition and resettlement. The AWSC has dedicated personnel who look \nafter safeguard implementation. The sample resettlement plan and the resettlement framework \nwere endorsed by the SCWE and uploaded on ADB\u2019s website on 19 December 2011. \n \n45.  Indigenous peoples. The additional financing is category C (no impact) for indigenous \npeoples. Most people in project areas are ethnic Armenian. A few ethnic or social minorities \nwere identified but are fully integrated into the majority population. Public consultations were \nconducted for six subprojects. \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \n46.  Potential risks associated with the additional financing are (i) implementation delays \ncaused by the poor performance of civil works contractors, (ii) management and operational \ncapacity  reform  by  AWSC  bringing  only  slow  improvement,  (iii)  regulatory  reforms  by  the \ngovernment such as on pricing bringing only slow improvement, and (iv) the lack of community \n                                                \n17 Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of the linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "10 \nsupport for the imposition of reforms by the AWSC. Measures to mitigate project risks are (i) \nusing experience acquired during the current project to identify and manage suitably qualified \ncontractors,  (ii)  ADB  closely  coordinating  with  the  AWSC  on  project  implementation,  (iii) \nfacilitating a more coordinated policy dialogue between various development partners including \nADB and the government, and (iv) maintaining and extending public outreach programs to new \nsubproject towns and villages to gain community support for the additional financing.18 \n \nIV.  ASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n \n47.  The government and the SCWS have assured ADB that implementation of the additional \nfinancing shall conform to all applicable ADB policies including those concerning anticorruption \nmeasures,  safeguards,  gender,  procurement,  consulting  services,  and  disbursement  as \ndescribed in detail in the project administration manual and loan documents. \n \n48.  The government and the AWSC have agreed with ADB on certain covenants for the \nadditional financing, which are set forth in the loan agreement and the project agreement. As a \ncondition  to the  effectiveness  of the  loan  agreement,  a relending  agreement,  in form  and \nsubstance satisfactory to ADB, shall have been duly authorized and delivered on behalf of the \ngovernment and the AWSC and shall have become fully effective and binding upon  such \nparties. \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n49.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and,  acting  in  the  absence  of  the  President,  under  the \nprovisions of Article 35.1 of the Articles of Agreement of ADB, I recommend that the Board \napprove  the  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to  SDR25,886,000  to  Armenia  for  the \nadditional financing of the Water Supply and Sanitation Sector Project, from ADB\u2019s Special \nFunds resources, with an interest charge at the rate of 1.0% per annum during the grace period \nand 1.5% per annum thereafter; for a term of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years; and \nsuch other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the \ndraft loan and project agreements presented to the Board. \n \n \n                Bindu N.
