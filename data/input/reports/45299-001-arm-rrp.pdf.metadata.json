The  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  loan  will  form  part  of  a  larger  sector  capital  investment  by  the \ngovernment  of  Armenia  and  other  international  financial  institutions  including  the  World  Bank \nand the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nThe government has been systemically facilitating improvements in the water supply and \nsanitation  (WSS)  sector  through  significant  legislative  and  institutional  reforms,  notably  the \nadoption of (i) the Water Code of Armenia in 2002 to promote water allocation based on water \nresource supply, (ii) the Law on Fundamental Provisions of the National Water Policy in 2005 for \nthe  strategic  use  and  protection  of  water  resources  and  systems,  and  (iii)  the  National  Water \nProgram in 2006 to address water resource formation and sustainability. \n \n4. \nIn  October  2007,  ADB  approved  funding  for  the  Water  Supply  and  Sanitation  Sector \nProject  to  upgrade  and  rehabilitate  WSS  systems  in  18  subprojects  in  16  towns  and  125 \nvillages. 3  The  current  project  had  two  components:  (i)  infrastructure  rehabilitation,  and  (ii) \nimprovements in management and operational efficiency. The current project is expected to be \ncompleted in the first quarter of 2012, which is 12 months ahead of schedule. \n \nForeseeing  the  likely  success  of  the  current  project,  the  government  has  requested \n5. \nthrough the State Committee for Water Economy (SCWE) that ADB further fund the additional \nfinancing  and  support  the  government\u2019s  continued  efforts  to  rehabilitate  and  extend  WSS \nsystems  with  an  additional  10  subprojects  and  further  improve  the  operational  efficiency  and \nfinancial management of the Armenia Water and Sewerage Company (AWSC), a government-\nowned  commercial  company  that  Soci\u00e9t\u00e9  d'Am\u00e9nagement  Urbain  et  Rural  (SAUR),  an \ninternational water utility, manages and operates through a management contract. \n \nThe  additional  financing  is  included  in  the  country  operational  business  plan 4  and \n6. \nstrongly  supports  the  government\u2019s  objective  of  facilitating  human  development  through  better \naccess  to  reliable  and  sustainable  supplies  of  potable  water,  improving  living  conditions  in \napproximately 18 towns and 92 villages in Armenia. \n\n                                                \n1  ADB.  2007.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors:  Proposed  Loan  to  the \nRepublic of Armenia for the Water Supply and Sanitation Sector Project. Manila (Loan 2363-ARM, for $36 million, \napproved on 31 October). \n\n2  The revised design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n3  The current project was designed and approved by ADB\u2019s Board of Directors in 2007 to  serve 16 towns and 125 \n\nvillages. The review in October 2011 reported the project serving 21 towns and 97 villages. \n\n4  ADB. 2011. Country Operations Business Plan: Armenia, 2012\u20132013. Manila. \n\n\fProgress and Performance of the Current Project \n\nB. \n \n7. \nProject  performance.  The  progress  and  implementation  of  the  current  project  is  on \ntrack.  The  AWSC  has  effectively  managed  and  coordinated  the  various  contract  packages  for \nthe  current  project  and  the  overall  operation  of  the  company.  The  recent  progress  report5 by \nAWSC and by ADB6 report the current project having delivered the key results discussed below. \n \nComponent  A.  Construction completion is 12 months ahead of schedule.7 More towns \n8. \nhave  been  covered  which  resulted  in  24,000  additional  beneficiaries  with  safe  and  reliable \nwater. Water  supply  and  sewerage  systems  in  21  towns  and  97  villages  were  rehabilitated  or \nreplaced. In terms of outcomes in the design and monitoring framework, the current project has \nimproved  access  to  reliable  supplies  of  potable  water  for  600,000  people,  which  exceeds  the \nbaseline target of 576,000 people. \n \n9. \nAll  40  civil  works  contracts  have  been  awarded,  with  33  completed  and  the  remainder \neither ongoing or close to completion. The project had disbursed $33 million of its $36 million as \nof the third quarter of 2011. More than 450 kilometers of water pipes and 17,500 water meters \nwere  installed  from  2008  to  2010.  The  number  of  consumers  receiving  24-hour  water  supply \nincreased by 46% from 2008 to 2010.8 \n \nComponent B. Improvements in service delivery are reflected in public satisfaction rates \n10. \nrising  to  66%  in  2010  from  42%  in  2008.  Tariff  collection  significantly  increased  from  61%  in \n2008  to  74%  in  2010.  Financial  management  improved  through  the  introduction  of  new \naccounting procedures, a computerized billing and collection system, and a system of mapping \nasset inventories. These results meet project targets as set out in outputs 3 and 4 of the design \nand  monitoring  framework  with  regard  to  improvements  in  AWSC\u2019s  operational  capacity  and \ncommunity  management.  The  exception  is  nonrevenue  water,  which  has  not  improved  during \nimplementation. \n \n11. \nEnvironment  and  social  safeguards  compliance.  All  subprojects  for  the  current \nproject  have  been  prepared,  appraised,  and  implemented  in  accordance  with  the  agreed \nenvironmental  assessment  and  review  procedure.  The  AWSC  has  screened  each  approved \nsubproject  for  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  effects.  No  indigenous  people  have  been \naffected or involved in any of the subprojects. \n \n12.  Management  of  risks.  Risks  identified  at  appraisal  have,  for  the  most  part,  been \nmanaged appropriately and so far none has affected project implementation. Anticipated delays \ncaused  by  procurement  issues  did  not  materialize.  The  AWSC  project  team  received  detailed \norientation  on  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2010,  as  amended  from  time  to  time),  and \nadvance procurement facilitated the early engagement of potential contractors. \n \n13. \nDuring current project implementation, public outreach increased community awareness \nof  project  effects  and  benefits,  which  improved  community  involvement  and  support  for  the \ncurrent project. \n \n\n                                                \n5  AWSC. 2011. Quarterly Progress Report, July 2011. Yerevan. \n6  ADB. 2011. Back-to-Office Report of the Review Mission, 13\u201319 May 2011. Manila. \n7  Original completion date is 30 June 2013 and the expected completion date is 30 June 2012. \n8  Additional information on other project targets and indicators is in the Summary of Project Performance (accessible \n\nfrom the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n2 \n\n \n\n\fImpact and Outcome \n\nProject\u2019s Eligibility for Additional Financing \n\nHowever, further action is needed with regard to tariff reform. A recent assessment9 by \n14. \nthe World Bank suggests that the existing tariff is sufficient to cover only the costs of operation \nand  emergency  and  routine  maintenance  but  not  of  preventative  maintenance,  replacement, \nand  system  expansion. Tariff reform  is  a  provision  under the  ADB  loan for the  current  project. \nTariff reform is critical to the long-term financial viability of water operators, so a tariff plan10 has \nbeen included as a loan provision under additional financing. \n \nC. \n \nThe additional financing meets the eligibility criteria in ADB\u2019s additional financing policy11 \n15. \nbecause  the  overall  project  remains  technically  feasible,  economically  viable,  and  financially \nsound.  The  government  accords  the  additional  financing  high  priority,  and  it  is  consistent  with \nthe  overall  project\u2019s  development  objectives  and  the  current  country  operations  and  business \nplan (footnote 4). \n \n16. \nAdditional financing will support the continuation of the current project to the next phase \nand  expand  outcomes  to  benefit  more  households  living  in  8  additional  project  towns12 and \napproximately  63  additional  project  villages  in  Armenia  through  better  access  to  water  supply \nthat is safe, reliable, and sustainable. \n \nD. \n \n17. \nThe overall project\u2019s revised impact and outcome will expand project benefits in terms of \ninfrastructure rehabilitation, water service improvements, and operational efficiency and improve \npublic health and the environment in 29 towns and 160 villages, which includes 8 towns and 63 \nvillages 13  not  covered  by  the  current  project,  through  safe,  reliable,  and  sustainable  water \nsupply.  The  government  is  expected  to  continue  to  implement  institutional  and  legislative \nreforms to help the AWSC enhance its management capacity and operational efficiency. \n \n18. \nThe  overall  project  will  reduce  poverty  by  (i)  reducing  the  incidence  of  waterborne \ndisease and cost  of  medical  care,  (ii)  allowing women  to  spend  less time collecting  water  and \nmore time participating in social and economic activities, (iii) providing safer and more reliable \nwater supply, and (iv) improving the quality of life in all project towns and villages. \n \nE. \n \nAs with the current project, the additional financing will (i) rehabilitate and upgrade water \n19. \nsupply  infrastructure,  (ii)  improve  the  performance  of  water  services,  and  (iii)  improve  the \nmanagement and operational efficiency of the water utility company. \n \n20.  Municipal  infrastructure  rehabilitation  and  improvement.  This  will  rehabilitate  or \nreplace  existing  water  supply  infrastructure.  Works  will  include  the  construction  of  600 \nkilometers of new mains and pipe networks to connect 110,000 new and existing customers; the \nrehabilitation of about 5 pumping stations, about 3 chlorination stations, 1 water treatment plant, \nand about 15 daily regulation reservoirs; and the installation of water meters on the premises of \n\nOutputs \n\n                                                \n9  World Bank. 2011.

Further, this component will redesign water \nsupply systems. \n \n 21.  Management  improvement  and  capacity  development. This  will  further  improve the \noperational  and  management  efficiency  of  the  AWSC  by  (i)  increasing  public  awareness  of \nmunicipal  infrastructure  rehabilitation  and  improvement  through  public  awareness  and  media \ncampaigns, (ii) strengthening service contracts between the AWSC and municipal governments \ngoverning  the  use  of  locally  owned  distribution  networks  and  the  contracts  between  the \ncompany  and  communities  taking  bulk  water  supply,  (iii)  developing  a  disconnection  policy for \nnonpayers, and (iv) preparing a strategy to develop the AWSC\u2019s human resources by improving \nstaff training and development. \n \nF. \n \n22. \n \n\nThe additional financing is estimated to cost $50 million (Table 1). \n\nInvestment and Financing Plans \n\n \n\nItem \n\nTable 1: Additional financing Investment Plan \n($ million) \nCurrent Project \n\nAdditional \nFinancinga \n\nA. \n \n \n \n \n\n \nB. \n \n \n \nC. \n\nBase Cost \n1.

The AWSC will service the loan and bear the \nforeign exchange risk, and the government will finance all the taxes and duties. \n \nG. \n \n25. \nProject management. The SCWE will again be the executing agency for the additional \nfinancing,  coordinate  implementation,  and  establish  the  project  coordination  unit,  which  is \nexpected  to  be  the  same  unit  as  for  the  current  project,  consisting  of  two  staffers:  a  project \ncoordinator and an administrative assistant. The project coordination unit will coordinate closely \nwith ADB, the project management unit (PMU), and government agencies. The AWSC will again \nbe the implementing agency and coordinate additional financing implementation with the PMU. \nIt is expected that the PMU under the  current project will take on the same responsibilities  for \nthe additional financing with a staff of about 14. The PMU will be headed by a project manager \nand  staffed  by  an  engineer  and/or  technical  specialist,  a  social  safeguard  specialist,  a \nprocurement specialist, a finance and accounting specialist, and support staff. \n \nImplementation  period.  The  additional  financing  will  be  implemented  over  5  years \n26. \ncommencing in May 2012. The implementation of the current project was also 5 years, but the \nstrong  performance  of  the  AWSC  has  the  current  project  now  scheduled  for  completion  12 \nmonths ahead of schedule. \n \n27.  Management  contract.  The  AWSC  is  currently  managed  and  operated  under  a \nmanagement  contract  with  SAUR,  a  private  international  provider  of  water  and  wastewater \nservices. The management contract with SAUR was recently extended for an additional 2 years \nto the end of 2013. \n \n28. \nAdvance  contracting  and  retroactive  financing.  To  facilitate  additional  financing \npreparation,  the  AWSC  has  requested  advance  contracting  and  retroactive  financing  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to \ntime)  with  respect  to  consulting  packages  for  technical  design,  construction  supervision, \ncapacity  building,  and  public  awareness  campaigns.  Any  concurrence  by  ADB  regarding \nprocedures, documentation, or proposals for awarding contract does not commit ADB to finance \nany such additional financing expenditures. \n \n29. \nProcurement Guidelines. The procurement plan is in the project administration manual.14 \n \n                                                \n14 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\nProcurement. Procurement financed under the additional financing will accord with ADB \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\fDisbursement  arrangements.  Loan  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with \n30. \nADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook  (2007,  as  amended from  time  to  time).  The  PMU  in  the \nAWSC,  as  implementing  agency,  will  establish,  maintain,  and  manage  a  separate  imprest \naccount  after  loan  effectiveness.  The  advance  under  the  imprest  account  will  not  exceed \nestimated eligible expenditures for the next 6 months, or 10% of the loan amount, whichever is \nlower. The statement of expenditures procedure may be used to reimburse eligible expenditures \nand liquidate the advance into the imprest account; any individual payment to be reimbursed or \nliquidated under the procedure will not exceed the equivalent of $100,000. \n \n31. \nProject  performance  management  and  evaluation. As with the current project, a list \nof  performance  indicators  will  be  tracked  and  evaluated  under  a  project  performance \nmanagement system. The project performance management system will monitor and track the \ntechnical  performance  of  the  additional  financing  and,  at  the  same  time,  the  additional \nfinancing\u2019s  social,  gender,  and  economic  benefits,  in  particular  for  the  poor  and  women. \nBaseline  data  and  performance  targets  will  have  to  be  established  at  project  commencement, \nand  performance  indicators  will  be  monitored  and reported  to  ADB  through  quarterly  progress \nreports. \n \n32. \nProject review. Review missions will be undertaken twice a year in the first 2 years and \nthereafter once a year. The review will evaluate the scope, implementation arrangements, and \nperformance of additional financing components. A staff consultant may be required for project \nreviews. \n \n33. \nSubproject  selection,  preparation,  and  appraisal.  Subprojects  will  be  selected \nsimilarly as for the current project, following these basic criteria: (i) The subproject is consistent \nwith  the  government\u2019s  sector  policies,  development  objectives,  and  development  strategy.  (ii) \nThe existing water supply network and equipment are dilapidated, broken down, and operating \ninefficiently, causing water supply shortages and environmental problems. (iii) The subproject is \ntechnically feasible and economically and financially viable.

Six subprojects representative of the 10 subprojects  in the additional financing \nwere  assessed  through (i)  a  survey  of  the  existing  water  supply  system,  (ii)  an  assessment  of \npopulation growth and likely future water demand in project towns and villages, (iii) a preliminary \nwater supply network design, and (iv) a development and investment program for water supply \nsystem improvements. \n \nThe  assessment  highlights  the  deteriorating  state  of  the  water  supply  systems  and  the \n35. \nneed  to  replace  and  upgrade  corroding  cast  iron  pipes  delivering  non-potable  water  to \ncommunities  in  project  towns  and  villages.  The  survey  noted  several  illegal  connections  to \nmains that cause inefficiencies and system losses. \n \n36. \nADB  has  engaged  an  independent  water  engineer  to  assess  the  validity  of  project \nassumptions and the viability of the additional financing. The review noted that assumptions in \nthe assessment were reasonable and that contingency arrangements are sufficient to cover any \nunplanned works. \n \nB. \n \nFollowing  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  the  Economic  Analysis  of  Projects,15 the  financial  and \n37. \neconomic analyses of the expanded project assess the economic viability of individual outputs \nand  of  the  additional  financing  and  further  indicate  appropriate  tariffs  to  ensure  fair  returns  on \ncapital and cover operating costs. To determine economic viability, benefits and costs streams \nhave been evaluated with and without the project, allowing estimates of incremental cash flows \nfor each output and their switching values to ascertain robustness. \n \n38. \nEconomic analyses of the three sample subprojects were undertaken as representative \nof the 10 subprojects in the additional financing. The major economic benefits are cost savings \non non-incremental supply to user households, previously connected and not, and the average \ndemand  price  for  incremental  water  supplies  based  on  user  willingness  to  pay.  The  non-\nincremental  benefits  are  quantified  using  cost  savings  from  (i)  the  use  of  alternative  water \nsources;  (ii)  time  saved  not  collecting  water;  (iii)  non-technical  losses;  and  (iv)  savings  on \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n                                                \n15 ADB. 2007. Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects. Manila. \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\noperation, maintenance, and storage. Incremental benefits are valued using  willingness to pay \nfor service improvement. Time saved not collecting water and willingness to pay are based on \nhousehold  surveys  regularly  updated  by  the  AWSC  and  on  actual  sampling  interviews  with \nexisting and potential beneficiaries. All of the above were quantified in economic terms. Health \nimpacts  that  accrue  only  after  several  years  of  system  operation  were  not  quantified.  The \nanalysis  shows  the  three  sample  subprojects  to  be  economically  viable,  with  the  economic \ninternal  rate  of  return  at  21.0%  for  the  subproject  in  Ararat,  19.2%  in  Lori,  and  17.6%  in \nGeharqunik, all exceeding the economic opportunity cost of capital of 12%. \n \n39. \nFinancial analysis assesses the capacity of subprojects to cover future costs for capital \ninvestments,  operation,  maintenance,  and  replacement.  Analysis  with  and  without  the  project \nassessed  costs  and  revenues  over  25  years.  The  key  financial  parameters  of  sustainability \napplied  in  the  analysis  were  (i)  the  financial  internal  rate  of  return  (FIRR),  which  should  be \nhigher than the weighted average cost of capital; (ii) tariff affordability, generally acceptable  at \nup to 5% of average household income; and (iii) positive year-end cash balances. \n \nThe  results  show  that  the  FIRRs for the  samples exceed the  weighted  average cost of \n40. \ncapital, estimated at 2.1%, with the subproject in Ararat at 6.5%, Lori at 6.3%, and Geharqunik \nat  4.9%.  To  assess  the  sensitivity  of  the  investment  to  changes  in  anticipated  benefits  and/or \ncosts, switching values have been calculated. The FIRRs for individual subprojects range from \n3.1%  to  3.3%,  showing  that  project  components  are  financially  viable  if  the  proposed  water \ntariffs  are  applied,  along  with  corresponding  government  subsidies  where  needed.  The \nswitching  values  suggest  that  the  estimates  are  robust  enough  to  absorb  reasonable  cost \noverruns, unanticipated decreases in revenue, and delays in project implementation. \n \nC. \n \n41. \nIn  the  current  project,  it  was  assessed  that  the  executing  agency  and  the  key \nimplementing  agency  both  satisfy  ADB\u2019s  financial  management  requirements  and  have  the \ncapacity  to  manage  procurement,  which  the  latest  assessment  suggests  still  holds  true.  Both \nhave  satisfactory  financial  management  capability  to  (i)  record  required  financial  transactions \nand  balances,  (ii)  provide  regular  and  reliable financial  statements  and  monitoring reports,  (iii) \nsafeguard  the  financial  assets,  and  (iv)  subject  the  required  financial  documents  to  auditing \nacceptable to  ADB.  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as amended to date)  was explained to \nand  discussed  with  the  government  and  the  SCWE.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and \nsupplementary measures are described in the project administration manual (footnote 14). \n \nD. \n \n42. \nResidents  of  approximately  18  towns  and  92  villages,  the  majority  in  rural  areas,  will \nbenefit  from  improved  water  supply  service,  among  them  the  poor  and  socially  excluded. \nCustomers  in  rural  areas  strongly  support  the  additional  financing,  which  will  significantly \nimprove their living standards and create new employment. The additional financing will improve \nwater-use,  hygiene,  and  sanitation  in  targeted  areas,  and  will  include  men  and  women  as \ninformed consumers monitoring service quality. At an institutional level, women will benefit from \nimproved  employment  and  career  opportunities.  A  gender  action  plan 16  includes  gender-\nsensitive outreach campaigns especially targeting women to inform them about their customer \n\nPoverty and Social \n\nGovernance \n\n                                                \n16 Phase 1 did not have a gender action plan, but phase 2 will promote effective gender mainstreaming. \n\n\fSafeguards \n\nrights, efficient water use, hygiene and sanitation issues, and how they can claim reliable WSS \nservices.17 \n \nE. \n \n43. \nEnvironment.  The  additional  financing  is  environmental  category  B,  as  its  subprojects \nwill not have significant irreversible or permanent negative environmental impacts during or after \nconstruction.  According  to  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),  the  subprojects  require \ninitial  environmental  examinations  (IEEs).  As  the  scale  of  each  operation  is  small  and  their \nimpacts  will  be  similar,  one  framework  IEE  has  been  prepared  for  the  entire  operation.  The \nchecklist  provided  in  the  framework  IEE  shows  that  site-specific  environmental  management \nplans  (SSEMPs)  for  each  subproject  location  will  be  prepared  to  address  all  location-specific \nimpacts.  The  impacts  likely  to  arise  from  such  operations  as  studied  in  the  IEE  are  largely \nlimited  to  construction  and  can  be  adequately  addressed through the  well-designed  mitigation \nrecommended  in  the  report  and  further  described  in  the  SSEMPs.  The  SSEMPs  will  be \nprepared by DSC consultants and reviewed by the environment specialist in the AWSC.  Public \nconsultations were held in 10 towns, and each session was attended by groups representing all \nneighboring villages. The IEE was uploaded on ADB\u2019s website on 18 January 2012. \n \n44. \nLand  acquisition  and  resettlement.  The  additional  financing  is  category  B  (limited \nimpacts)  on  involuntary  land  acquisition  and  resettlement.  The  preliminary  design  shows \nrehabilitation and construction conducted mostly on property owned by the AWSC, on municipal \nland,  or  within  the  rights-of-way  assigned  to  municipal  infrastructure.  Limited  involuntary \nresettlement is envisaged in the removal of moveable assets (i.e., trees and crops) or restricted \naccess  to  communal  lands  with  its  reallocation  into  a  hydraulic  facility.  A  sample  resettlement \nplan for one of the subprojects has been prepared. Involuntary resettlement due diligence was \nconducted  for  the  remaining  subprojects.  Any  subsequent  subprojects  that  would  require  the \nacquisition  of  private  lands  will  be  ineligible  for  financing  under  the  additional  financing.  The \napproved  resettlement  framework  of  the  current  project  was  reviewed  and  updated  for  the \nadditional financing. The changes in the updated resettlement framework are (i) replacing ADB\u2019s \nInvoluntary Resettlement Policy (1995) with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement, (ii) restrictions \nto  subprojects  involving  the  acquisition  of  private  property  or  causing  significant  involuntary \nresettlement,  (iii)  the  provision  of  land  donation  procedures  following  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy \nStatement requirements on negotiated land acquisition, and (iv) the addition of a few regulations \nrelevant  to  land  acquisition  and  resettlement.  The  AWSC  has  dedicated  personnel  who  look \nafter safeguard implementation. The sample resettlement plan and the resettlement framework \nwere endorsed by the SCWE and uploaded on ADB\u2019s website on 19 December 2011. \n \n45. \nIndigenous  peoples. The additional financing is category C (no impact) for indigenous \npeoples.  Most  people  in  project  areas  are  ethnic  Armenian.  A  few  ethnic  or  social  minorities \nwere  identified  but  are  fully  integrated  into  the  majority  population.  Public  consultations  were \nconducted for six subprojects. \n \nF. \n \n46. \nPotential  risks  associated  with  the  additional  financing  are  (i)  implementation  delays \ncaused  by  the  poor  performance  of  civil  works  contractors,  (ii)  management  and  operational \ncapacity  reform  by  AWSC  bringing  only  slow  improvement,  (iii)  regulatory  reforms  by  the \ngovernment such as on pricing bringing only slow improvement, and (iv) the lack of community \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n                                                \n17 Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of the linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\nsupport  for  the  imposition  of  reforms  by  the  AWSC.  Measures  to  mitigate  project  risks  are  (i) \nusing  experience  acquired  during  the  current  project  to  identify  and  manage  suitably  qualified \ncontractors,  (ii)  ADB  closely  coordinating  with  the  AWSC  on  project  implementation,  (iii) \nfacilitating a more coordinated policy dialogue between various development partners including \nADB and the government, and (iv) maintaining and extending public outreach programs to new \nsubproject towns and villages to gain community support for the additional financing.18 \n \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n\n \n47. \nThe government and the SCWS have assured ADB that implementation of the additional \nfinancing shall conform to all applicable ADB policies including those concerning anticorruption \nmeasures,  safeguards,  gender,  procurement,  consulting  services,  and  disbursement  as \ndescribed in detail in the project administration manual and loan documents. \n \n48. \nThe  government  and  the  AWSC  have  agreed  with  ADB  on  certain  covenants  for  the \nadditional financing, which are set forth in the loan agreement and the project agreement. As a \ncondition  to  the  effectiveness  of  the  loan  agreement,  a  relending  agreement,  in  form  and \nsubstance satisfactory to ADB, shall have been duly authorized and delivered on behalf of the \ngovernment  and  the  AWSC  and  shall  have  become  fully  effective  and  binding  upon  such \nparties. \n \n\nV. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n \n49. \nI am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and,  acting  in  the  absence  of  the  President,  under  the \nprovisions  of  Article  35.1  of  the  Articles  of  Agreement  of  ADB,  I  recommend  that  the  Board \napprove  the  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to  SDR25,886,000  to  Armenia  for  the \nadditional  financing  of  the  Water  Supply  and  Sanitation  Sector  Project,  from  ADB\u2019s  Special \nFunds resources, with an interest charge at the rate of 1.0% per annum during the grace period \nand 1.5% per annum thereafter; for a term of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years; and \nsuch  other  terms  and conditions  as  are  substantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in the \ndraft loan and project agreements presented to the Board. \n \n \n \n \n \n22 March 2012 \n\nBindu N.
