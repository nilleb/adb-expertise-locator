THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nof up to $500 million, without a sovereign guarantee, to Power Grid Corporation of India Limited \n(POWERGRID) for the Green Energy Corridor and Grid Strengthening  Project in India.1 A \nseparate  report  and  recommendation  for  a  loan  of  up  to  $500  million,  with  a  sovereign \nguarantee, is being proposed concurrently. 2  \n \n2.  The project will finance power transmission system upgrades in India, including (i) a \nportion of the Government of India\u2019s Green Energy Corridor initiative to facilitate the transfer of \npower from renewable energy-rich areas to other parts of the country, through 765 kilovolt (kV) \nand  400  kV  high  voltage  transmission  lines  and  an  associated  765/400kV  substation  and \nequipment; and (ii) four high voltage direct current (HVDC) terminals (two at 800 kV and two at \n320 kV) to increase interregional connectivity between India\u2019s western and southern regional \npower grids.3   \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  India suffers from an unreliable power supply that inhibits its economic growth potential \nby constraining commercial activities. About 300 million citizens have no access to electricity, \nwhile some areas face daily power outages because of supply shortages and transmission \nbottlenecks.4 The government is scaling up investments in the generation, transmission, and \ndistribution subsectors to address these issues. India is also promoting increased use of clean \nrenewable energy, universal electricity access, and energy self-sufficiency by supplementing \nconventional power-generation sources (oil, gas, and coal). This includes ambitious renewable \nenergy targets in the electricity-generation mix. As of 31 July 2015, India had an installed \ngenerating capacity of 275.9 GW, of which 36.5 GW was renewable energy.5 In 2015, the \nMinistry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE) announced state-level renewable energy-\ncapacity targets for 2022 with a national aggregate of 175 GW. About 90% will come from solar \nand wind sources.6 \n \n4.  Green  Energy  Corridor  initiative.  In  2012,  MNRE  and  the  Forum  of  Regulators7 \ncommissioned POWERGRID to conduct a green energy corridor study to identify nationwide \ntransmission investments required to accommodate the additional renewable energy-generation \ncapacity.8 Almost  60%  of  this  renewable  energy  capacity  is  located  in  six  states\u2014Andhra \nPradesh, Gujarat, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Rajasthan, and Tamil Nadu. To facilitate the transfer \nof power from these renewable energy-rich states to others, as well as address the absorption \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \n2  Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2015.

Report on Green Energy Corridors\u2013Transmission Plan for Envisaged Renewable Capacity. \nGurgaon.  ", "2 \n \nof power and the intermittency and timing differences of renewable energy, POWERGRID \nidentified $7 billion in investments to be undertaken in phases, starting under the Twelfth Five \nYear Plan. These include (i) intrastate transmission investments of about $3.6 billion within \nrenewable energy-rich states and (ii) phased interstate investments of more than $3.4 billion to \nenable power flows across states over long distances. \n \n5.  Expanded interregional connectivity.  India\u2019s national transmission grid is divided into \nfive  regions.9 Synchronous  interconnectivity  previously  existed  only  between  the  northern, \neastern,  western,  and  northeastern  regions.  On  31  December  2013,  POWERGRID \ncommissioned an interconnection between the southern and western regions, which enabled \nsynchronous operation of an interconnected national power grid. This not only augmented the \ninterregional power transfer capacity of southern states, but also relieved congestion in some \ntransmission corridors. Southern states, including Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, and Tamil Nadu, \nhave been particularly troubled by power shortages. A more resilient regional and interregional \ngrid is essential in facilitating power transfers among states and regions. Furthermore, daily \npeak power demand does not occur simultaneously in all regions. One state or region may have \na power surplus while another faces a deficit. Hence, an integrated national grid facilitates (i) \npower transfers from areas with a surplus to those with a deficit, (ii) optimization of the power \nsystem by integrating the electricity market and encouraging power trading, and (iii) competitive \nelectricity prices and improved power supply mix through greater use of renewable energy. \nInterregional power transfer capacity as of 31 December 2014 was 46.5 GW and is envisaged \nto increase to 72.3 GW by 2017.10  \n \n6.  Borrower. POWERGRID, India\u2019s national power transmission company, is responsible \nfor  planning,  developing,  and  operating  the  high-voltage  interstate  and  interregional  power \ntransmission  network.11 POWERGRID  operates  about  90%  of  the  country\u2019s  interstate  and \ninterregional  transmission  networks\u2014consisting  of  117,679  circuit  kilometers  (km)  of \ntransmission lines and 197 transmission substations with a transformation capacity of about \n239,424 megavolt-amperes  as of 31 July 2015\u2014and provides nondiscriminatory open access \nto its transmission system for any licensed utility or generating company.12 POWERGRID has a \nsound  implementation  record  in  upgrading  and  strengthening  the  national  high-voltage \ntransmission  network,  with  consistently  good  operational  performance  as  evidenced  by \ntransmission network availability of above 99% for the past 5 years.  \n \n7.  Project  design.  POWERGRID\u2019s  immediate  investment  plans  consist  of  the  Green \nEnergy Corridor initiative\u2019s interstate portions, including a high-capacity transmission corridor \nconnecting  major  renewable  energy  pockets  from  Gujarat  in  the  western  region  through \nRajasthan to Punjab state in the northern region. This project will fund a portion of these \ninterstate investments, consisting of two 765 kV alternating current transmission lines, one 400 \nkV alternating current transmission line, and one 765/400 kV substation in Rajasthan state \nconnecting  to  a  765/400  kV  substation  in  Punjab  state,  including  a  real-time  system  for \nmeasuring and monitoring power flows. Other portions of the initiative are funded by German \ndevelopment cooperation through KfW for \u20ac500 million (about $556 million equivalent) that will \nbe recognized through a memorandum of understanding as parallel collaborative cofinancing.13 \n                                                \n9  The five regions are the northern, eastern, southern, western, and northeastern regions. \n10 Government of India, Ministry of Power. Creation of a National Grid. New Delhi.           \n    (http://powermin.nic.in/transmission-0) \n11 As of 30 June 2015, the Government of India owned 57.9% of POWERGRID, which makes the company majority \nstate-owned and therefore a public sector undertaking. \n12 POWERGRID. Our Network.  \nhttp://www.powergridindia.com/_layouts/PowerGrid/User/ContentPage.aspx?PId=80&LangID=English. \n13 Development Coordination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). ", "3 \n \nA separate project component will further increase interregional transmission capacity between \nthe western and the southern regional grids as part of a high-priority HVDC transmission link, \nsince the southern region has an 11.3% overall deficit and a 19.8% peak power deficit, while the \nwestern region is in surplus. The envisaged southern region generation-capacity additions are \nnot  sufficient,  and  increased  transmission  capacity  is  therefore  required.  This  component \nconsists of two 800 kV HVDC terminals\u2014one in Chhattisgarh (western region) and the other in \nTamil Nadu (southern region)\u2014and two 320 kV HVDC terminals connecting Kerala and Tamil \nNadu. This will expand western\u2013southern interconnectivity from 10 GW to 16 GW between \nChhattisgarh and Tamil Nadu, and the portion between Tamil Nadu and Kerala will have 2 GW \ncapacity. The adoption of HVDC transmission technology improves power transfer efficiency \nand reduces transmission losses over long distances. It is thus a least-cost solution and low-\ncarbon investment option well suited for high-capacity interregional power transfers.  \n \n8.  Alignment  with  ADB  strategy  and  operations.    Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB) \nsupport for the Green Energy Corridor initiative and financing transmission networks to increase \ninterregional power flows is consistent with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2020 and Energy Policy14 which \nadvocate the promotion of renewable energy, increased energy efficiency, improved energy \nsecurity, and facilitation of the country\u2019s transition to a low-carbon economy. It is also consistent \nwith India country partnership strategy, 2013\u2013201715 which supports (i) clean and renewable \nenergy expansion; (ii) enhanced energy efficiency; (iii) promotion of advanced high-voltage \ntransmission technology, including HVDC transmission lines to increase transmission efficiency; \nand (iv) grid integration of renewable energy.  \n \n9.  Since 1995, the ADB has provided POWERGRID seven sovereign-guaranteed loans \nand one nonsovereign operation (NSO) loan to strengthen its transmission system nationally. \nThe projects have a good implementation history and high ratings. Among these, ADB provided \ntwo loan facilities in 2011 consisting of an NSO loan and a sovereign-guaranteed loan in a \nsingle financing package.16 The NSO loan represented POWERGRID\u2019s first transaction without \nsovereign support, and helped POWERGRID diversify its financing sources.  \n \nB.  Value Added by ADB Assistance  \n10.  Renewable energy-based power generation is still more expensive than conventional \ncoal-fired power generation in India and poses an additional cost burden due to its power \nintermittency. The government\u2019s intervention through the Electricity Act, 2003, the National \nAction Plan on Climate Change, and the Jawaharlal Nehru National Solar Mission has created \nthe necessary legal and regulatory frameworks and incentives to attract private investments into \nthe  sector,  thereby  capturing  the  environmental  benefits  of  renewable  energy  projects. \nHowever,  the  public  sector  is  responsible  for  ensuring  timely  investments  in  transmission \nnetworks to allow for increased renewable energy penetration. In this context, POWERGRID\u2019s \nnear-term funding needs for the interstate green energy corridor exceed $3.4 billion, whereas \nenhanced overall interregional connectivity\u2014critical not just for renewable energy but for bulk \npower  evacuation  and  power  sector  optimization\u2014will  require  a  further  $10  billion.17 The \nprevious ADB sovereign and NSO loans helped POWERGRID diversify its funding sources. \n                                                \n14 ADB. 2008.

New Delhi. http://powermin.nic.in/overview-\n1 \n ", "4 \n \nPOWERGRID will continue to access all available sources, including domestic and international \nbanks, capital markets, and multilateral and other development financial institutions, including \nADB, to fund its capital investment plans. To maintain affordability, POWERGRID must match \nits funding sources\u2019 tenors more closely to the transmission assets it constructs, owns, and \noperates, which have 35-year cost recovery periods inherent in transmission tariff regulations.  \n \n11.  ADB\u2019s assistance thus plays an important role in financing India\u2019s power transmission \ncomponents that are critical in achieving the government\u2019s renewable energy targets, as well as \nincreasing overall interregional interconnection capacity. Without this, (i) significant additional \ngeneration  capacity  cannot  be  transferred,  (ii)  renewable  and  conventional  energy  project \nbankability  becomes  a  challenge,  (iii)  power  trading  will  not  expand,  and  (iv)  continued \nincreases in access to affordable power will not materialize. The proposed loans are attractive \nto POWERGRID because (i) the sovereign loan provides long-term, low-cost financing that \nhelps keep transmission tariffs at reasonable levels, while the additional financing provided by \nthe NSO loan at attractive terms also includes a long tenor; (ii) ADB\u2019s presence on both the \nsovereign  and  NSO  side  provides  comfort  to  potential  commercial  cofinanciers  and  risk \nparticipants; and (iii) ADB has the ability to deliver multisource financing and hybrid solutions to \ncompanies like POWERGRID by accessing the combined knowledge and experience of its \nregional, country, and private sector operations. \n \nC.  Impact and Outcome \n12.  The impact will be increased overall efficiency of the Indian power system, expanded \naccess to electricity, increased private investment in renewable energy, and enhanced energy \nsecurity in India. The outcome will be improved and more reliable transmission system capacity \nin the northern, western, and southern regions of India. \n \nD.  Outputs \n13.  These will be achieved by 2020 through the following outputs:  \n(i)  Green energy corridor system expansion in the northern region: \n(a)  765 kV double circuit transmission line from Ajmer to Bikaner (263 km); \n(b)  765 kV double circuit transmission line from Bikaner to Moga (366 km); \n(c)  400 kV double circuit (Quad) transmission line from Bikaner (new substation) to \nBikaner (existing substation)  (26 km); \n(d)  765/400 kV substation with 2x1500 megavolt-ampere transformers at Bikaner; \n(e)  extensions of the existing Ajmer and Moga substations by adding two line bays \nto each; and \n(f)  real-time measurement and monitoring equipment. \n(ii)  Transmission  interconnection  capacity  expansion  between  the  western  and \nsouthern regions: \n(a)  800 kV HVDC terminal stations at Raigarh in Chhattisgarh and Pugalur in \nTamil Nadu; and \n(b)  320 kV voltage source converter HVDC terminal stations at Pugalur inTamil \nNadu; and North Trichur in Kerala. \n \nE.

POWERGRID has in-house planning capabilities, including computer-aided facilities for \ntransmission  system  planning,  design,  operation,  and  maintenance.  POWERGRID\u2019s  green \nenergy corridor study (footnote 8) identified the required investments and estimated capital \nexpenditure to ensure adequate capacity and system reliability to meet India\u2019s demand growth. \nThe  Ministry  of  New  and  Renewable  Energy,  the  Forum  of  Regulators,  and  the  Central \nElectricity Authority reviewed data from state transmission utilities and the Central Electricity \nRegulatory Commission. The study also included power demand projections taken from the \n18th Electric Power Survey (2013) of the Central Electricity Authority.  \n \n20.  The  800  kV  HVDC  transmission  system  is  state-of-the-art,  commercially  proven \ntechnology, and is the most cost-effective means of transmitting bulk power over long distances. \nFor  high-capacity,  point-to-point transmission, HVDC  is  economically  preferable  for  system \nlengths  exceeding  700\u2013800  km.  The  project  will  enhance  energy  efficiency  by  reducing \ntransmission  losses  to  about  3%  below  levels  of  typical  conventional  alternating  current \ntransmission systems. Screening for climate risks was conducted, and risks were assessed as \nlow. Such risks are considered in the project design.  \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n21.  The project\u2019s financial internal rate of return, calculated on a real basis, is 5.76%\u2014higher \nthan the weighted average cost of capital of 3.66%\u2014and remains as such in the various \nadverse sensitivity scenarios.19 Its economic internal rate of return is estimated to be 16.60%,20 \nhigher  than  the  social  discount  rate  of  10%.  The  project  is  thus  financially  viable  and \neconomically sustainable. \n \n22.  The  government  has  awarded  POWERGRID  \u201cNavratna\u201d  status,  which  gives  public \nsector undertakings a degree of managerial and financial autonomy despite their  majority-\ngovernment ownership. 21 POWERGRID maintains an international long-term issue credit rating \nof BBB\u2013 (Outlook: Stable) from both Standard & Poor\u2019s and FitchRatings, and enjoys the \nhighest domestic credit rating of AAA.22 Based on the cost-plus nature of the tariff-setting \nprocess coupled with its operating efficiency, POWERGRID has increased revenues and net \nprofits consistently, maintaining a robust financial position with stable cash flows to cover its \ncosts, capital investment, and debt payments. Over the past 3 years, it achieved a post-tax \nreturn on net worth of more than 10.0% and an average debt service coverage ratio of 1.5 \n                                                \n19 Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). The nominal financial internal rate \nof return is 10.72%, higher than the nominal weighted average cost of capital of 7.78%. \n20 Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n21 Navratna-status public sector undertakings may invest up to the lesser of (i) Rs10 billion or (ii) 15% of net worth on \na single project or 30% of net worth in a single year, without having to seek the government\u2019s permission. \n22 Since 2001, POWERGRID\u2019s domestic bonds have been rated AAA by the Credit Rating Information Services of \nIndia Limited and AAA by the Investment Information and Credit Rating Agency of India Limited. Since 2008, Credit \nAnalysis and Research has also given these bonds an AAA rating. ", "7 \n \ntimes. In FY2015, the return on net worth rose to 13.1%23 and the debt service coverage ratio \nimproved to 2.0 times.24 POWERGRID\u2019s debt\u2013to\u2013equity ratio has remained at about 70:30. \nAlthough POWERGRID has an aggressive investment plan and a large need for additional \nborrowings, financial  projections show  it  has  a  sound financial  position  even  under  stress \nscenarios. \n \nC.  Governance \n23.  As a publicly listed company, POWERGRID is subject to several strong governance \nmeasures imposed by India\u2019s Securities and Exchange Board, which enhance accountability, \ntransparency, and predictability of its financial governance through information disclosure to \nshareholders,  investment  professionals,  and  the  public.  POWERGRID  has  an  advanced \naccounting system using computerization with confidentiality and integrity at various levels. The \nfinancial management risk is thus low.

Access to \nreliable,  stable,  and  adequate  electricity  supply  increases  agricultural,  industrial,  and \ncommercial  productivity,  and  enhances  economic  growth.  Economic  growth  helps  reduce \npoverty and improve quality of life, particularly for the most vulnerable segments of society. The \n  \nproject will avoid or minimize negative impacts on affected people.25 Social design features \ninclude (i) compensation for loss of crops and trees at market value, (ii) additional assistance for \naffected vulnerable households, and (iii) equal opportunities to access employment and equal \npay for men and women under civil works contracts. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n \n25.  The  project  is  classified  as  category  B  for  environment, category  B  for  involuntary \n \nresettlement, and category C for indigenous people. In accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy \nStatement (2009), the project\u2019s potential environmental and social impacts and risks have been \nidentified. Measures to avoid, mitigate, and compensate for adverse environmental impacts are \nincorporated  in  the  initial  environmental  examination,  which  includes  the  environmental \nmanagement plan.26 Environmental impacts of transmission lines can be minimized by careful \nroute  selection.  One  of  the  lines  passes  through  about  0.7  km  of  degraded  forest  land. \nCompensatory  afforestation  required  by  the  government  to  offset  this  impact  is  budgeted. \nPrivate land will be required for the HVDC terminal  in Pugalur, Tamil Nadu, and is being \nacquired  on  a  willing-buyer,  willing-seller  basis  and  through  negotiated  settlement.27 The \nremaining substations are on government or POWERGRID-owned land. Due diligence has \nconfirmed there are no encroachers or informal settlers and that the land is free of claims and \ndisputes. For the transmission towers and lines, impacts are temporary and will occur during \n                                                \n23 POWERGRID. 2015.

The negotiation is being done through meaningful consultation with affected \npersons and POWERGRID's committee dealing with the land purchase, and will aim to offer a fair price. \nPOWERGRID will ensure any negotiations with affected persons are transparent, and an appropriate expert will \nvalidate the transaction. POWERGRID will document the processes of negotiation, such as the consultation \nprocesses, policies, and laws applicable to such transactions and third-party validation, and will submit to ADB after \nthe completion of negotiations and payment. \n ", "8 \n \nconstruction in loss of crops and trees, which will be compensated. Measures to avoid, mitigate, \nand compensate for adverse impacts are incorporated in a compensation plan for temporary \ndamages,  analogous  to  ADB\u2019s  resettlement  plan. 28  This  contains  basic  elements  of  a \nresettlement plan, as required by ADB's Safeguard Policy Statement for category B projects, \nand is based on the principles of the Safeguard Policy Statement; the Indian Telegraph Act \n1885; and the Electricity Act, 2003. POWERGRID has the commitment and ability to manage \nthe social and environmental risks.29Information disclosure to and consultations with affected \n \npeople will be conducted following ADB requirements. \n \n26.  POWERGRID  will  comply  with  national  labor  laws  and,  pursuant  to  ADB\u2019s  Social \nProtection Strategy30, will take measures to comply with the internationally recognized core \nlabor  standards. The  borrower  will  report regularly  to  ADB  on  (i)  its (and  its  contractors\u2019) \ncompliance with such laws and (ii) the measures taken. Information disclosure and consultation \nwith affected people will be conducted in accordance with ADB requirements. \n \nF.  Anticorruption Policy \n \n27.  POWERGRID was advised of ADB\u2019s policy of implementing best international practice \nrelating to combating corruption, money laundering, and the financing of terrorism. ADB will \nensure  that  the  investment  documentation  includes  appropriate  provisions  prohibiting \ncorruption, money laundering, and the financing of terrorism, and remedies for ADB in the event \nof noncompliance. \n \nG.  Risks and Mitigating Measures   \n \n28.  Major risks and mitigating measures are shown in Table 4 and further described in the \nrisk  assessment  and risk management  plan.31 The  risks  are manageable,  and  appropriate \nmitigation measures are incorporated.
