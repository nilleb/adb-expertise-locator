The  project  covers  six  severely  flood-affected  provinces:  Banteay  Meanchey, \nBattambang, Kampong Cham, Kampong Thom, Prey Veng, and Siem Reap.  \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \nThe 2011 floods. The Mekong River water level started to rise beyond normal levels in \n3. \nearly  August  2011,  with  the  water  level  rising  significantly  when  typhoons  Nesat  and  Nalgae \nbrought exceptionally heavy rain in late September and early October 2011, respectively. Some \n18  provinces  and  municipalities  were  subsequently  inundated  and  over  1.7  million  people \naffected. The immediate direct social impacts on the affected community were devastating. The \nfloods  caused  the  death  of  250  people  and,  overall,  more  than  350,000  households  were \naffected;  almost  270,000  houses  were  flooded  of  which  1,297 were  damaged;  about  405,000 \nhectares (ha) of rice crops were affected of which almost 230,000 ha were severely damaged or \ndestroyed  (9.3%  of  the  cultivated  area);  1,675 livestock  were  lost,  and  more  than  70,000 \ndrinking water wells were contaminated. \n \n4. \nDamage and loss assessment. A number of partial assessments of the impacts of the \n2011 floods have been carried out by the Government of Cambodia and development partners.2 \nHowever,  no  agency  took  the  lead  role  in  preparing  a  comprehensive  post-disaster  needs \nassessment. To fill this gap, a preliminary damage and loss assessment3 was carried out by the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB). ADB also supported a post-flood household survey jointly with \nother  development  agencies  to  measure  the  impact  of  the  floods  on  rural  communities. 4 \nTogether,  these  two  initiatives  supported  the  identification  of  geographical  focus  and  the \nselection of subprojects.  \n  \nInfrastructure  damage.  The  damage  to  public  infrastructure  includes  roads  (national, \n5. \nprovincial,  and  rural);  irrigation  and  water  resources  facilities;  water  supply  and  sanitation \nfacilities  (mostly  small-scale  rural);  schools;  and  health  centers.  The  preliminary  damage  and \nloss  assessment  estimated  damage  to  infrastructure  at  $376  million  along  with  $35  million  of \nlosses caused by loss of connectivity and access to markets. In the social sectors, the estimate \nfor  damages  is  $35  million.  In  agriculture,  the  impacts  of  the  floods,  mainly  on  rice,  were  $40 \n\n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  United  Nations  Office  for  the  Coordination  of  Humanitarian  Affairs.  2011.  Kingdom  of  Cambodia:  Evaluation  of \n\nPost-Flood Needs Assessment Data. Phnom Penh.  \n\n3  Preliminary Damage and Loss Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n4  The in-depth post-flood household assessment measures food security, nutrition, health, and livelihood indicators \namong  a  representative  sample  of  flood-affected  households.  In  addition  to  ADB,  the  survey  is  supported  by: \nAction Aid, DanChurchAid, Danish Red Cross, Save the Children, United Nations Children's Fund, and World Food \nProgram. The findings of the assessment will guide decisions for early recovery targeting and response, with the \nfinal report expected in April 2012. \n\n\f2 \n \n\nmillion of damages and $139 million of losses (largely of paddy rice). The 2011 floods caused \nan estimated $451 million in damages and $174 million in losses.5 \n \n6. \nFlood emergency response management. In line with ADB\u2019s guidelines for emergency \nassistance, the need for improvement of the government\u2019s capacity to prepare for and manage \ndisasters was considered.6 The main agency responsible for disaster management in Cambodia \nis the National Committee for Disaster Management (NCDM), chaired by the Prime Minister and \ncomprising  all  involved  government  agencies.  Many  development  partners  and  institutions, \nincluding ADB, are involved in various aspects of flood management. ADB has provided support \nto  the  NCDM  under  the  Emergency  Food  Assistance  Project7 to  build  capacity  to  respond  to \nfood  emergencies  through  enhancing  the  information  system,  and  to  the  Ministry  of  Water \nResources  and  Meteorology  under  the  Water  Resources  Management  Sector  Development \nProgram8 to promote integrated water resource management and adaptation to climate change. \nThe proposed Greater Mekong Subregion Flood and Drought Risk Management and Mitigation \nProject  aims \nto  strengthen  flood  management  capacity  by  addressing  structural  and \nnonstructural measures, including assisting the Ministry of Water Resources and Meteorology to \nestablish  the  National  Flood  Forecasting  Center,  and  strengthening  capacity  for  community-\nbased disaster risk management.  \n \n7. \nStrengthening  future  flood  and  disaster  risk  management.  Given  the  need  to \nstrengthen  flood  and  disaster  management  capacities  in  Cambodia9,  additional  flood-support \nfunding  from  a  trust  fund  is  being  considered  to  develop  a  disaster  management  program, \nseparate  from  but  complementary  to  the  project.  The  proposed  activities  will  strengthen  the \nNCDM\u2019s  capacity  to  harness  the  resources  and  expertise  of  the  relevant  line  ministries  and \nother organizations, and provide a robust approach for prevention, mitigation, and preparedness \nto  manage  future  floods.  The  activities  will  also  include  community-based  disaster  risk \nmanagement programs, targeting at-risk communities at district, commune, and village levels in \nareas covered under the project.10 \n \n8. \nComplementary  project  resources.  ADB  has  been  able  to  identify  existing  projects \nthat can be adjusted to address the emergency. Specifically, ADB will: (i) assist with restoration \nof  rural  water  supply  facilities  under  the  ongoing  Second  Rural  Water  Supply  and  Sanitation \nSector  Project, 11 (ii)  restore  some  irrigation  schemes  within  the  Northwest  Irrigation  Sector \n\n                                                \n5  More details on the damages by sector are in Preliminary Damage and Loss Assessment (accessible from the list \n\nof linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n6  A review of the organization and management of resources, roles, and responsibilities to deal with all phases of a \nnatural disaster, preparedness, response, and recovery, as well as ongoing or planned projects in the emergency \nassistance  area  is  in  Emergency  Management  during  Natural  Disasters  in  Cambodia  (accessible  from  the  list  of \nlinked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n7  ADB.  2008.

The  government  allocated  about  $40  million  of  budgetary \n9. \nresources  to  flood  damage  in  2011,  and  plans  to  allocate  an  additional  $90  million  in  2012. \nThese  funds  are  being  allocated  in  close  collaboration  with  the  respective  line  ministries, \ndevelopment partners, and civil society. \n \n10. \nConsultation  and  coordination.  The  project  has  been  closely  coordinated  with  other \ndevelopment  partners  involved  in  flood  relief  and  rehabilitation  activities. 16    Civil  society \nrepresentatives were also consulted. \n \n11. \nproject activities, the restoration of flood-damaged infrastructure is divided into three stages: \n\nFlood  impact  response  framework.  As  a  framework  for  structuring  the  proposed \n\nStage  1:  Immediate  repairs  to  reestablish  use  of  the  infrastructure  and  restore \nminimum  functioning  levels.  The  most  urgent  work  was  implemented  by  the \ngovernment using its own resources in the immediate aftermath of the floods. \nStage  2:  Fast-track  repairs  where  it  is  necessary  to  substantially  repair  the \ndamage  before  the  next  wet  season  (June\u2013July  2012),  to  secure  the  existing \n(undamaged) works and avoid more extensive damage during the rains. Urgent \npreparation of stage 2 packages has been the emphasis of the line ministries. \nStage 3: Remaining flood damage restoration to complete the remaining damage \nrepairs within the following two dry season construction periods. \n\nOutputs \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n \nB. \n \n12. \nThe impact of the project is economic and social recovery from the 2011 floods in project \nprovinces. The outcome of the project is the restoration of critical public and social infrastructure \nassets to their original standards or better.  \n \nC. \n \n13. \nproposed project prioritizes specific areas and sectors. \n \nNational  and  provincial  road  restoration. The project will reconstruct flood-damaged \n14. \nnational and provincial roads in four provinces. In Prey Veng, 2 kilometers (km) of a ring road, \nwhich also serves as a flood protection dyke for Prey Veng City,17 will be strengthened, and five \nbridges along National Road No. 11 that were severely weakened by the floods will be replaced \n\nGiven  the  extent  of  the  infrastructure  damage  and  the  limited  resources  available,  the \n\n                                                \n12  ADB.  2003.

In  Banteay  Meancheay,  Battambang  and  Kampong  Cham  provinces,  72  km  of \nprovincial  roads  will  be  repaired  and  upgraded,  and  one  bridge  replaced.  The  works  will  be \ncarried  out  in  three  stages.  Temporary  stage  1  work  has  already  been  completed  under \ngovernment funding to restore minimum function of the roads. Stage 2 is urgent work that needs \nto  be  fast-tracked,  with  substantial  works  done  during  the  2012  dry  season,  to  secure \nfunctioning  of  the  roads  during  the  2012  wet  season.  Stage  3  works  will  be  prepared  to \ncommence after the 2012 wet season. \n \nRural  roads  restoration.  The  project  will  reconstruct  about  450  km  of  flood-damaged \n15. \nrural  roads  in  five  provinces:  Banteay  Meancheay,  Kampong  Cham,  Kampong  Thom,  Prey \nVeng,  and  Siem  Reap.  Reconstruction  civil  works  will  be  carried  out  in  three  stages;  the \ngovernment  has  already  completed  stage  1.  During  stage  2,  project  roads  will  be  repaired  to \nfacilitate  immediate  access  by  reshaping  the  road  section  and  providing  a  100\u2013150  millimeter \nlaterite overlay, before the rains in 2012. During stage 3, road sections will be strengthened to \nprotect  against  future  flood  damage,  with  cross-drainage  facilities  and  paving  of  laterite  or \ndouble  bituminous  surface  treatment.  Under  this  output,  a  demonstration  exercise  relating  to \nlabor-intensive construction and maintenance of rural roads will be carried out.18 \n \n16. \nIrrigation  and  flood  control.  Under  this  output,  about  26  flood-damaged  irrigation \nschemes  covering  about  25,000  ha19 will  be  repaired  in  at  least  five  provinces:  Battambang, \nKampong Cham, Kampong Thom, Prey Veng, and Siem Reap. Since flood restoration work for \nirrigation  schemes  often  involves  relatively  small  works to restore full  operation,  it  is  proposed \nthat  schemes  in  other  provinces  may  also  be  considered  depending  on  the  detailed \nassessments  during  implementation,  subject  to  agreement  of  the  Ministry  of  Economy  and \nFinance  (MEF,  the  executing  agency)  and  ADB.  Stage  1  works  involved  temporary  measures \nduring  2011,  mainly  using  sand  bags  and  pumps  to  restore  irrigation  as  far  as  possible.  It  is \nproposed  to  complete  relatively  small-scale  stage  2  works  before  the  2012  wet  season  in \n19 schemes to restore most of the irrigation operations, and to secure undamaged works for the \nnext wet season. Stage 3 covers works that require more detailed investigations, and this work \nwill commence after the 2012 wet season. \n \n17. \nProject and flood management.

Given that works under stage 2 generally \n21. \nneed to commence before the expected date of loan effectiveness in April 2012, and to ensure \nthat project activities commence in a timely manner, the government has requested the use of \nretroactive  financing  for  consulting  services  and  stage  2  procurement  packages.24 Retroactive \nfinancing is considered essential to finance the repair or rehabilitation of certain critical facilities \nbefore  the  next  flooding  season.  Retroactive  financing  can  apply  to  eligible  expenditures \nincurred  after  30  September  2011,  but  not  earlier  than  12  months  before  the  date  of  the  loan \nagreement  or  grant  agreement,  provided  that  the  project  coordination  and  monitoring  unit \n(PCMU), assisted by the project consultants, certifies the expenditures, and that the certification \nis acceptable to ADB.

For stage 3 subprojects, expected to commence works following the next \nrainy  season  in  October  2012,  competitive  procurement  procedures  will  be  followed  for  all \nproject packages. Civil works packages of less than $3,500,000 may be procured using national \ncompetitive  bidding  (NCB)  and,  for  larger  packages,  international  competitive  bidding  will  be \nused. The first subproject to be carried out under stage 3 by each implementing agency under \noutputs  1\u20133  following  NCB  will  be  subject  to  prior  review  and  approval  by  ADB  before \ncommencing.  Subsequent  NCB  packages  over  $1,000,000  will  be  submitted  to  ADB  for  prior \nreview and approval. Procurement packages valued at less than $1,000,000 will be sent to the \nPCMU for endorsement and to ADB for post-approval. \n \n23. \nConsulting  services.  Consultant  support  will  be  provided  under  the  project to  support \nthe  PCMU 25  and  the  three  implementing  agencies.  Under  outputs  1\u20133  of  the  project,  one \ninternational consulting firm, in association with national consulting firms, will assist each of the \nthree  implementing  agencies.  The  international  firms  will  be  engaged  through  single  source \nselection in the respective sectors to provide the necessary services. Individual consultants (two \ninternational  and  two  national)  will  be  engaged  to  assist  the  PCMU  under  output  4. 26  All \nengagement  of  consultants  under  ADB  financing  will  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to time). As requested by \nthe MEF, ADB will assist the government in selecting individual consultants for the PCMU. \n \n24.  Monitoring  and  evaluation.  The  PCMU  will  establish  the  project  performance \nmonitoring  and  evaluation  system  within  6  months  of  loan  effectiveness  using  the  targets, \nindicators,  assumptions,  and  risks  in  the  design  and  monitoring  framework  (Appendix  1).  The \ndata  will  be  disaggregated  by  income  levels,  gender,  and  ethnicity.  Further,  the  PCMU  will \nmonitor  and  ensure  compliance  with  loan  assurances:  policy,  legal,  financial,  safeguards,  and \ngender. The midterm review will also be held to examine whether the project implementation is \nin line with the project objective and scope. Further details are provided in the PAM. \n \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n \nA. \n \n25. \nEconomic  and  financial  assessments  will  be  undertaken  for  all  subprojects  under  the \ninvestment  packages  in stage  3.  Economic  analysis  of flood  projects focuses  on future  losses \navoided and, through restoring basic infrastructure and improving connectivity, such projects will \nimprove the welfare of affected people and businesses. They will also directly generate jobs and \nincomes through reconstruction activities. \n \nB. \n \n26. \nThe  public  financial  management  system  is  being  developed,  but  is  still  inadequate  to \nachieve  accountability  in  public  expenditures.27 The  government  has  implemented  the  Public \n                                                \n25 Advance  Actions  for  the  Flood  Damage  Emergency  Reconstruction  Project  (TA  8051-CAM),  for  $225,000,  has \nbeen mobilized to provide consulting support for (i) advance actions in the areas of procurement, (ii) technical and \nengineering  services  to  fill  gaps  in  the  resources  already  available,  (iii)  consulting  services  to  support  the \npreparation of various elements of the Report and Recommendation of the President, and (iv) consulting services \nrequired to prepare the preliminary damage and loss assessment. \n\nGovernance \n\n26 Complete details of the terms of reference of the consulting firms are in the PAM (accessible from the list of linked \n\ndocuments in Appendix 2). \n\n27 The  assessments  of  public  financial  management,  procurement,  and  anticorruption  efforts  draw  on  ADB.  2011. \n\nCambodia: Country Governance Risk Assessment Report and Risk Management Plan. Manila. \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n \n\nPoverty and Social \n\nFinancial  Management  Reform  Program  since  2004.28 The  procurement  assessment,  drawing \non  procurement  diagnostic  studies,  indicates  limited  recent  progress.  The  Public  Procurement \nLaw,  January  2012  and  the  Anti-Corruption  Law,  2010  strengthen  sanctions,  but  these  laws \nhave  just  been  adopted.  The  government\u2019s  Standard  Operating  Procedures,  Procurement \nManual, and Financial Management Manual for Externally Assisted Projects have been applied \nto  ADB-financed  projects,  and  are  being  updated  under  ADB  support.  The  anticorruption \nassessment  identifies  important  legislative  and  institutional  developments,  and  stresses  these \nhave  achieved  initial  results.  Important  legislative  developments  include  penalty  provisions  in \nthe  2008  Public  Finance  Law,  strengthening  the  Penal  Code  for  corrupt  offenses,  2009,  and \npassing the Anti-Corruption Law, 2010. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) \nwas  explained  to  and  discussed  with  the  government  and  the  implementing  agencies.  The \nspecific policy requirements and supplementary measures are described in the PAM. \n \nC. \n \nPoverty  reduction. 29  The  floods  affected  a  number  of  the  poorest  provinces  in \n27. \nCambodia.  The  project  is  geographically  targeted  to  the  areas  most  in  need  and  with  a  high \nconcentration  of  poverty.  The  household  survey  carried  out  jointly  with  other  development \npartners  will  assist  in  measuring  the  poverty  impacts  of  the  flood  on  rural  communities.  The \ndesign  incorporates  features  that  will  help  reduce  poverty  both  directly  and  indirectly.  In \nrehabilitating damaged road and irrigation infrastructure, the direct poverty reduction impact will \ncome  from  the  provision  of  short-term  employment  and  much-needed  cash  income  to  poor \nwomen  and  men  using  labor-intensive  approaches  where  appropriate.  The  repaired  and,  in \nsome cases, upgraded road and irrigation infrastructure will indirectly reduce poverty by helping \nto  restore  livelihoods  and  reduce  vulnerability  by  improving  physical  access  to  markets  and \nsocial services as well as by increasing agricultural productivity. \n \n28. \nGender equity. Pre-existing gender inequalities have likely worsened in the aftermath of \nthe  floods  and  will  deteriorate  further  unless  women\u2019s  participation  in  the  reconstruction  is \nensured.  The  project  includes  a  Labor  and  Gender  Action  Plan  (LGAP)30 to  ensure  women\u2019s \naccess  to  project  benefits,  mostly  through  their  participation  in  the  labor  force  recruited  to \nreconstruct and maintain the infrastructure. Equal pay for equal work will be guaranteed. Social \ndevelopment  and  gender  consultants  will  be  hired  to  support  each  implementing  agency  in \nimplementing and monitoring the LGAP, which focuses on stage 3 activities. ADB\u2019s Cambodia \nResident Mission\u2019s gender specialist will support LGAP implementation. \n \nD. \n \n29. \nEnvironment.  The  project  is  classified  category  B  for  environment.  Subprojects  will \nreconstruct  existing  transport  and  irrigation  infrastructure.  Subproject  selection  criteria  are \nformulated  to  avoid  significant  adverse  environmental  impacts.

Each  platform  is  built  on  achievements  of  the  earlier  one.  Platform  1 \nintroduced  budget  credibility;  platform  2  strengthens  accountability  and  internal  control,  particularly  in  line \nministries; platform 3 improves linkage between policy priorities and budget planning; and platform 4 strengthens \nintegration of accountability and review processes for both financial and performance management.

The project is classified category B for involuntary resettlement and category C \nfor  indigenous  peoples.  Subproject  selection  criteria  are  formulated  to  avoid  land  acquisition, \nresettlement  impacts,  and  social  risks. 32  A  resettlement  framework 33  was  prepared  and \ndisclosed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement,  and  government  laws, \nregulations,  and  policies  to  guide  planning  studies  and  detailed  designs  of  subprojects. \nImplementation  arrangements  in  the  PCMU  and  PIUs  build  on  experience  from  ADB-financed \nprojects, and ensure the PIUs have adequate capacity to understand and prepare resettlement \nplans,  through  consultant  support  and  additional  capacity  building.  Widespread  consultations \nwill be undertaken with stakeholders in project areas during implementation. \n \nE. \n \n31. \nGiven  the  importance  of  governance  risks  in  Cambodia,  the  project  will  implement \nspecific  project  level  actions  to  mitigate  risks.  Building  on  the  Cambodia  Governance  Risk \nAssessment and Risk Management Plan 2011, these risks have been identified and mitigation \nmeasures have been developed in the risk assessment and risk management plan.34 The major \nproject  risks  and  mitigation  measures  include:  (i)  limited  financial  management  capacity  - \nongoing  implementation  of  the  Public  Financial  Management  Reform  Program  to  improve \nbudget  preparation  and  execution,  financial  management  and  reporting,  procurement,  and \nstrengthening of internal controls. In addition, ADB is supporting the MEF in implementing part \nof  the  Public  Financial  Management  Reform  Program  which  includes  strengthening  the  public \nfinancial  management  systems  in  two  of  the  implementing  agencies,  the  Ministry  of  Rural \nDevelopment  and \ninadequate \nprocurement  capacity  -  strengthening  of  procurement  capacity  through  the  Public  Financial \nManagement  Reform  Program,  as  well  as  additional  measures  by  ADB  to  strengthen  the \nprocurement  capacities  of  the  MEF  and  the  implementing  agencies,  including  provision  of \nprocurement  consultants  and  training  on  the  Standard  Operating  Procedures  and  the \nProcurement  Manual;  and  (iii)  corruption  -  requiring  all  contractors/bidders,  suppliers  and \nconsultants to sign declarations of ethical conduct, strengthening transparency through posting \nproject information on the IA websites, developing complaint handling mechanisms, monitoring \nand  enforcement  of  procurement  procedures  and  contracts;  and  joint  investigation  of \nirregularities by the National Audit Authority and the ADB\u2019s Office of Anticorruption and Integrity. \n \n\nthe  Ministry  of  Water  Resources  and  Meteorology;  (ii) \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n                                                \n31 Environmental Assessment and Review Framework (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n32 Subprojects with involuntary resettlement impacts will not be included in stage 2; those with significant involuntary \nresettlement  impacts  will  not be  included  in  stage  3.
