Sulfur dioxide and particulates produced through coal \ncombustion are two major air pollutants, resulting in the formation of acid rain, which now falls \non about 30% of the PRC's total landmass. Industrial boilers and furnaces consume almost half \nof the PRC's coal and are the largest single point sources of urban air pollution.  \n \n3. \nTo  minimize  environmental  degradation,  the  Government  is  working  to  reduce  coal \nconsumption  and  increase  usage  of  cleaner  fuels  such  as  natural  gas,  which  currently \nrepresents  less  than  3%  of  the  energy  mix  in  the  country.  While  the  Government  has \nrestructured upstream oil- and gas-producing companies, the lag of reforms in the downstream \nsector  continues  to  be  a  bottleneck  to  greater  expansion  of  natural  gas  distribution  services. \nLocal  gas  distribution  companies,  which  would  play  a  key  role  in  a  competitive  gas  market, \nremained controlled by the municipal government  or state-owned enterprises. To alleviate this \nbottleneck, the Government recently stepped up efforts to encourage private sector participation \nin the downstream gas distribution market by relaxing policy constraints on foreign ownership in \nmunicipal distribution companies.  \n \n4. \nThe core business of CGH is twofold: (i) the investment, operation, and management of \nmunicipal  natural  gas  pipeline  infrastructure;  and  (ii)  the  sale  and  distribution  of  piped  and \ncompressed  natural  gas  in  municipalities  in  the PRC.  As  of March  2006,  CGH  had  developed \nand  was  operating  48  municipal  natural  gas  distribution  companies  across  eleven  provinces \n(autonomous  regions  and  directly-administered  cities),  including  Anhui,  Guangdong,  Guangxi, \nHebei,  Hubei,  Hunan,  Jiangsu,  Liaoning,  Shaanxi,  Zhejiang  provinces,  and  Chongqing. \nAlthough  more  than  800,000  households  are  currently  being  connected  and  served  by  CGH, \nCGH\u2019s  total  customer  base  is  estimated  to  exceed  4  million,  five  times  the  number  of \nhouseholds currently connected. To meet the growing demand for natural gas in the PRC, CGH \nhas to carry out massive capital investments in the next several years.   \n \nA. \n \n\nThe Natural Gas Sector  \n\nDemand and Supply \n\n1. \n \n5. \nHistorically, natural gas has constituted a small proportion of the overall energy balance \nin  the  PRC.  Natural  gas  utilization  was  heavily  concentrated  in  fertilizer  production  to  support \nagricultural production, with little or no natural gas utilized for power generation. Consequently, \nnatural  gas  demand  between  1975  and  1990  remained  relatively  stable.  Demand  growth  has \naccelerated  since  1999,  exceeding  10%  annually,  except  in  2002,  following  rapid  economic \nexpansion. Natural gas consumption increased by 1.7 times in the 1990s as the economy grew. \n\n\f \n\n4\n\nConsumption reached approximately 47 billion cubic meters (bcm) per annum by 2005, and is \nestimated  to  more  than  double  by  2010.  The  Energy  Research  Institute  of  the  National \nDevelopment  and  Reform  Commission  estimates  that  natural  gas  demand  in  the  PRC  will  be \napproximately  120  bcm  in  2010  and  200  bcm  in  2020,  or  2.5  and  4.2  times  the  2005 \nconsumption.  \n \n6. \nTotal domestic natural gas supply is projected to be approximately 80 bcm in 2010 and \n110 bcm per annum in 2020. This indicates a growth rate of 7.5%, while the annual growth rate \nfor natural gas demand is estimated to be 10.8% for the same period. The demand and supply \ngap  is  expected  to  be  met  by  imports,  which  will  be  achieved  via  international  pipelines  and \nliquefied natural gas.  \n \nBy the end of 2000, the total length of the urban gas distribution pipeline was 89,458 km. \n7. \nIt  comprised  33,655  km  for  natural  gas,  48,384  km  for  coal  gas,  and  7,419  km  for  liquefied \npetroleum gas. According to the Ministry of Construction, the gas distribution subsector supplied \n8.2  bcm  of natural  gas,  15.2  bcm  of  manufactured  coal gas,  and  10.5 million  tons of  liquefied \npetroleum  gas  in  2000  when  only  about  15  large  cities  were  supplied  with  natural  gas.  The \nnumber of cities using natural gas increased to over 140 in 2005 and is expected to increase to \n270  by  2010.  Municipal  natural  gas  distribution  will  consume  approximately  40  bcm  of  natural \ngas,  representing  about  35%  of  the  total  natural  gas  consumption  in  the  PRC.  Downstream \ndevelopment  of  natural  gas  markets  is  estimated  to  require  significant  capital  investment: \nCNY74.8  billion  (US$9.3  billion)  during  2005\u20132010.  The  natural  gas  sector  is  described  in \nAppendix 1. \n\nSector Policies and Regulations \n\n \n2. \n \n8. \nThe  PRC\u2019s  natural  gas  industry  was  vertically  integrated  under  government  mandate \nuntil  the  late  1990s,  with  state-owned  enterprises  responsible  for  exploration,  production, \ntransportation,  and  marketing  activities.  The  industry  was  governed  by  rationing,  price  floors, \nand  ceilings,  which  were  arguably  not  reflective  of  true  production  capability.  Recently,  the \nGovernment has taken steps to reform and liberalize the gas market; key among these include \n(i) lifting  restrictions  on  natural  gas  usage  for  the  fertilizer  subsector  and  accelerating  the \npenetration  of  natural  gas  into  both  the  power  generation  and  residential  subsectors,  and  (ii) \nopening up the downstream gas market to foreign and private investors. \n \n9. \nPromotion  of  natural  gas  usage  can  be  attributed  to  the  Government\u2019s  focus  on  (i) \neconomic  development,  (ii)  energy  security,  and  (iii)  environmental  protection.  The  11th  Five-\nYear  Plan  (2006\u20132010),  in  relation  to  the  energy  industry,  emphasizes  the  importance  of  a \ndiversified energy base to ensure optimization of the energy mix and obtaining as much energy \nsecurity as possible for the PRC. The abundance of domestic natural gas reserves is seen as a \ngreat opportunity to obtain some flexibility in its dependency on external sources of energy.  \n \n10. \nTo encourage the increased use of natural gas in the overall energy mix, the expansion \nof natural gas exploration and development of the transportation network are indispensable to \nimprove access to natural gas. To increase the supply, encouraging regulations are in place for \n(i)  the  construction  of  the  natural  gas  trunk  pipe  network  and  supporting  facilities;  and  (ii)  the \nrelaxation  and  diversification  of  downstream  distribution  network  ownership,  focusing  in \nparticular on private sector ownership. This will also be in line with the national policy to develop \nthe western part of the PRC, which has natural gas reserves to drive forward the much-needed \neconomic development of the region.  \n \n\n\f5 \n\n1. \n\nCountry Strategy \n\nAsian Development Bank Operations \n\n \nB. \n \n \n \nThe  ADB  country  strategy  for  the  PRC 1   is  based  on  four  development  objectives: \n11. \n(i) promotion  of  equitable  and  inclusive  growth,  (ii)  development  of  better  and  more  efficient \nmarkets,  (iii)  environment  improvements,  and  (iv)  promotion  of  regional  cooperation.  This  is \nconsistent  with  priorities  highlighted  in  the  ADB  Medium-Term  Strategy  II  (2006\u20132008), \nincluding  catalyzing  investment  to  improve  the  investment  climate,  expanding  private  sector \noperations,  and  managing  the  environment.  ADB\u2019s  assistance  focuses  on  reducing  the \ninequality  between  the  coastal  and  interior  provinces,  and  the  income  gap  between  the  urban \nand rural populations. The Government accords high priority to expediting the PRC\u2019s transition \nto  a  market  economy  as  the  basis for  growth  and  job  creation,  which  require  better  and  more \nefficient markets for the private sector.  \n \nTo  support  Government  initiatives  to  employ  the  private  sector  as  the  driving  force  for \n12. \nthe country\u2019s long-term economic growth and job creation, ADB plans to substantially increase \nits private sector operations in the PRC focusing on the infrastructure and energy sectors, the \nfinancial  sector,  and  environmental  improvements.  In  the  infrastructure  and  energy  sectors, \nADB  prioritizes  pioneering  projects  with  innovative  contractual  and  financial  structuring  to \nencourage private sector participation, enhance management expertise, and improve corporate \ngovernance.  \n \n \n\n2. \n \n13. \nADB\u2019s  energy  sector  strategy  supports  the  following  operational  priorities  (i)  poverty \nreduction by, among other ways, creating energy infrastructure for sustainable economic growth \nand increasing the poor\u2019s access to energy, particularly in rural areas; (ii) promotion of private \nsector involvement by restructuring the energy sector, and creating an enabling environment for \nthe  private  sector;  (iii)  addressing  regional  and  global  environment  impacts  by  supporting \nmeasures to address acid rain problems and use of clean energy; and (iv) promotion of regional \ncooperation. \n \n\nEnergy Sector Strategy \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nADB Project \n\n \nA. \n \n14. \nThe  Project,  which  allows  for  both  loan  and  equity  participation  by  ADB,  will  support \nCGH\u2019s investment plan to fund a series of new natural gas distribution infrastructure projects in \nmunicipalities.  The  Project  aims  to  develop  natural  gas  distribution  infrastructure  and  address \nfinancial  constraints  faced  by  municipalities,  two  key  obstacles  to  natural  gas  market \ndevelopment in the PRC. \n \nB. \n \n15. \nresidential, industrial, and commercial customers in municipalities.  \n \n\nEstablished in 1995, CGH is a downstream natural gas distribution company, supplying \n\nChina Gas Holdings Limited  \n\n                                                 \n1 ADB. 2005.

The \nshareholding  was  recently  expanded  to  include  Gas  Authority  of  India  Limited  and  Oman  Oil \nCompany, both of which have significant experience in gas distribution and technical expertise \nin their respective countries.  \n\n \n2. \n\nOperations \n\n \n17. \nAs  of  March  2006,  CGH  has  obtained  concession  rights  for  48  piped  natural  gas \nprojects.  CGH  is  serving  residential,  industrial  and  commercial  customers  in  11  provinces \n(autonomous regions and directly-administered cities),  including Anhui, Guangdong, Guangxi, \nHebei, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangsu, Liaoning, Shaanxi, Zhejiang provinces, and Chongqing.  \n \n18. \ndirectors, and three independent nonexecutive directors.  \n \nC. \n \n\nCGH\u2019s  board  comprises  11  directors:  five  executive  directors,  three  nonexecutive \n\nEnvironmental Aspects and Social Dimensions \n\nEnvironment, Safety, and Health \n\nimplementing  well-established  mitigation  measures  prescribed \n\n1. \n \n19. \nThe nature of municipal natural gas distribution projects entails construction of facilities \nat  the  gateway  station  and  laying  small  gas  pipes.  The  design  and  operation  of  the  gateway \nstation and gas distribution system are required by laws to strictly follow safety standards and \npractices that are well established by professional institutions in the gas industry. The controlling \nauthorities also periodically monitor safety aspects. The construction of facilities at the gateway \nstation and pipe laying are minor civil works with minor environmental disturbances that can be \nreadily  minimized  by \nin \nconstruction contracts. Operations of the gateway station do not create a significant amount of \nwaste. Only a small volume of natural gas is occasionally vented and flared for a short duration \nduring  routine  maintenance  of  valves,  filters,  and  meters.  The  flaring  of  this  small  volume  of \nnatural gas over a short period is unlikely to have significant impacts on ambient air quality.  \n \n20. \nCGH  has  a  corporate  policy  on  health,  safety,  and  environment.  It  does  not  have  an \nexplicit  social  policy  since  its  downstream  natural  gas  business  does  not  relate  to  any \noutstanding  social  issues.  CGH  abides  by  national  and  provincial  environmental  laws.  It  duly \nconducts  environmental  impact  assessments  for  all  of  its  projects  and  applies  for  all  permits \nrequired in implementing the projects and operating project facilities. \n \n21. \nThe  Project  is  classified  as  environment  category  FI.  To  comply  with  ADB  safeguards, \nincluding \nCGH  will  set  up  an  environmental  management  system \nenvironmental assessment and review procedures for potential investments that are acceptable \nto  ADB.  ADB\u2019s  environmental  guidelines  and  policies  and  the  PRC\u2019s  environmental  laws  and \nregulations will be complied with, and implementation of environmental mitigation measures will \nin  collaboration  with  municipal  environmental  protection  bureaus.  Such \nbe  monitored \nenvironmental  mitigation  measures  will  be \nreports  on  project \nimplementation  and  annual  reports  on  environmental  monitoring.  CGH  will  confirm  to  ADB \nperiodically its compliance with environmental requirements of ADB and the PRC, and report to \nADB.  \n \n\nfor  new  projects, \n\nin  progress \n\nincluded \n\n2. \n\nResettlement \n\n\f7 \n\n \n22. \nThe  Project  is  classified  as  involuntary  resettlement  category  B/C  and  indigenous \npeoples  category  C.  For  downstream  natural  gas  distribution  sector  projects,  land  acquisition \nand  relocation  of  inhabitants  are  limited  and  if  needed,  are  carried  out  by  the  municipal \ngovernments before the concessions are open for competition. CGH thus has a limited role in \nland  acquisition  and  relocation.  For  new  concessions,  CGH  will  undertake  due  diligence  to \nensure no acquisition of rights to land or displacement of people or enterprises. In the event of \ninvoluntary  resettlement  as  a  result  of  land  acquisition  by  project  companies,  CGH,  together \nwith  the  relevant  joint  venture,  will  ensure  that  all  acquisition  and  resettlement  activities  are \nundertaken  in  accordance  with  the  requirements  of  ADB\u2019s  policy  on  involuntary  resettlement2 \nand the agreed resettlement framework.  \n \n\n3. \n\nDevelopment Impact \n\n \n23. \nThe Project is designed to promote economic growth and environmental improvement by \nincreasing  the  supply  of  clean  energy  and  financing  to  municipalities.  Specifically,  the  Project \nwill  (i)  prevent  further  environmental  degradation  by  supporting  Government  efforts  to \nencourage  the  use  of  cleaner  fuels  in  urban  areas,  and  expand  downstream  natural  gas \ndistribution  through  private  sector  participation;  (ii)  provide  flexibility  in  energy  supply  for  the \nPRC  by  taking  advantage  of  the  PRC\u2019s  abundant  natural  gas  reserves,  which  are  largely \nunderdeveloped and underutilized; (iii) help lower overall exposure to the volatility of oil prices \nand contribute to the stability of the economy; (iv) help build a nascent natural gas distribution \nmarket  by  providing  international  best  practices  to  the  PRC\u2019s  downstream  distribution  market, \nthus  setting  standards  for  other  companies  to  follow  as  the  market  matures;  and  (v) \ndemonstrate  social  responsibility  in  local  municipalities  through  the  enforcement  of  provincial \npolicies  that  stipulate  the  preferential  supply  of  natural  gas  to  households  first,  prior  to  the \ndevelopment of the industrial customer base. \n \n\n4. \n\nDevelopment Effectiveness \n \n\n24. \nADB\u2019s  Private  Sector  Operations  Department  and  Operations  Evaluation  Department \nare  formulating  guidelines  for  implementing  the  Good  Practice  Standards  for  Evaluation  of \nPrivate  Sector  Investment  Operations,  which  were  prepared  by  the  Evaluation  Cooperation \nGroup of the multilateral development banks. These standards cover the roles of the Operations \nEvaluation  Department  and  Private  Sector  Operations  Department,  the  evaluation  dimensions \nfor  private  sector  operations,  the  nature  of  annual  reporting,  and  dissemination  of  reports  and \nlessons. According to the standards, the three principal dimensions for private sector evaluation \nare  development  outcome  (encompassing  project  performance,  the  project\u2019s  contribution  to \neconomic  sustainability,  and  its  contribution  to  private  sector  development),  investment \nprofitability  of  the  project  intervention  to  the  institution  itself  (i.e.,  specific  returns  on  the  loan, \nguarantee, or equity investment), and operational effectiveness measured and assessed on an \noverall department level. \n \n25. \nThe  Project  was  assessed  and  described  from  the  perspectives  of  development \neffectiveness  and  project  framework  in  terms  of  its  specific  performance,  and  the  Project\u2019s \ncontribution  to  both  economic  sustainability  and  private  sector  development.  The  Project  is \ndeemed  to  be  developmentally  effective  and  its  performance  measurable.  A  brief  summary \ndiscussion follows on each of these parameters. \n \n\n                                                 \n2   ADB. 1995. Involuntary Resettlement. Manila. \n\n\f \n\n8\n\na. \n\nProject Performance \n\n \n26. \nThe  Project  will  be  assessed  against  its  specific  investment  capital,  construction, \noperational  and  financial  objectives.  Essentially,  effectiveness  will  be  measured  against  how \nsuccessfully  the  Project  attracts  private  sector  capital  (both  debt  and  equity),  how  the  Project \nsecures municipal natural gas distribution concessions, how the Project develops and expands \nmunicipal natural gas distribution networks, and how  much natural gas the Project supplies to \nconsumers  and  industries.  The  Project  will  be  also  measured  by  financial  profitability  and \nsustainability through timely debt repayment capacity and equity returns. \n \n\nEconomic Sustainability \n\nThe Project will be assessed, from an economic sustainability perspective, on its ability \n27. \nto develop and implement municipal natural gas distribution networks, supply municipal natural \ngas to consumers and industries, and contribute to environmental improvements and economic \ngrowth. Additional employment created as a result  of project implementation will be taken into \naccount.  The  Project\u2019s  successful  implementation  also  impacts  the  promotion  of  downstream \nnatural gas sector reform. \n \n\nPrivate Sector Development \n\n28. \nThe  Project  will  be  assessed  and  measured  on  how  it  contributes  to  private  sector \ndevelopment. The focus of this assessment is on the Project\u2019s commercial and financial viability, \nand  its  demonstrative  and  catalytic  effect  on  future  private  sector  developments  in  the  natural \ngas distribution sector itself and the economy as a whole. \n \n29. \nThe Project was not specifically assessed from an investment profitability point of view, \nas a profitability assessment is better gauged and measured against a portfolio of similar loans \nand equity investments. Similarly, the Project was not assessed and measured against overall \noperational effectiveness, as this is a departmental consideration.  \n\n \nb. \n \n\n \nc. \n \n\n \nIV.  THE PROPOSED ASSISTANCE \n \n\nEquity Investment \n\nA. \n \n30. \nThe proposed equity investment is to subscribe for ordinary shares in CGH at a cost of \nup  to  US$25  million.    The  proposed  ADB  equity  investment  constitutes  a  critical  and  integral \npart of ADB assistance for CGH and the Project. ADB will be entitled to nominate a person to be \nappointed as a nonexecutive director on the CGH board throughout the period that ADB holds \nthe shares. \n \nB. \n\nLoans \n \n31. \nThe  proposed  direct  loan  is  for  up  to  US$50  million  equivalent:  50%  will  be  lent  in  US \ndollars  and  the  balance  in  CNY.  A  proposed  complementary  loan  is  for  up  to  US$75  million \nunder ADB\u2019s complementary financing scheme will be lend in US dollars.  \n \nC. \n \n\nJustification \n\n\fADB\u2019s assistance for the Project is justified on the basis of its development impacts and \n32. \ndemonstration effects. It supports the Government\u2019s development plans and ADB\u2019s operational \nstrategies, and provides the value added of ADB participation in the Project: \n\n9 \n\nThe  Project  will  provide  access  to  a  clean,  reliable,  and  long-term  energy \nsource to the people in municipalities where adequate municipal natural gas \ninfrastructure is lacking and demand is currently not fully met.  \n\nThe Project will contribute to the PRC\u2019s efforts to promote the use of natural \ngas  and  improve  the  environment.  The  Project  will  have  a  significant \ndevelopment  impact  by  helping  reduce  air  pollution  by  substituting  natural \ngas  for  coal  energy.  The  reduction  of  particulates  and  sulfur  dioxide  from \nhouseholds and  small  industries  will  have  the  most  beneficial  impact  on  the \nurban  population,  in  particular  the  urban  poor,  who  suffer  severely  from \nindoor and outdoor air pollution.  \n\nThe  Project  supports  the  Government\u2019s  strategy  of  encouraging  private \nsector participation in the municipal natural gas distribution sector, given the \nsubstantial investment required in expanding the natural gas pipeline network \nand  the  limited  self-financing  capacity  of  the  municipalities.  The  Project  is \nexpected  to  free  up  municipal  governments\u2019  resources  from  investments  in \nnatural gas distribution to other types of critical expenditures related to social \nconcerns and health.  \n\nThe Project is in line with ADB\u2019s country and energy sector strategies, which \nemphasize  supporting  energy  infrastructure  development  with  private  sector \nparticipation  and  environmentally  clean  technology.  It  also  supports  ADB\u2019s \nthematic  priorities  of  economic  development,  private  sector  development, \ngood  governance,  and  environmental  protection.  The  Project  contributes  to \nthe  promotion  of  ADB\u2019s  operational  priorities  in  the  energy  sector  by \n(a) providing  innovation  in  investment  priorities  through  funding  of  municipal \nnatural  gas  distribution,  (b)  supplying  clean  energy  where  environmental \ndegradation  is  serious,  and  (c)  enhancing  access  to  clean  energy  for  urban \nand peripheral residents. \n\nThe  Project  is  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  private  sector  operations  in  the  PRC, \nwhich have focused on the infrastructure and energy sectors, financial sector, \nand  environmental  improvements.  In  the  infrastructure  and  energy  sectors, \nADB  prioritizes  pioneering  participation,  enhancing  management  expertise, \nand  improving  corporate  governance.  This  Project  will  provide  highly  skilled \nemployment and know-how transfer opportunity to the local community.  \n\n \n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\n \n(iv) \n\n \n(v) \n\n \n\n \nD. \n\nAnticorruption, Combating Money Laundering and the Financing of Terrorism \n\nCGH  was  advised  of  ADB\u2019s  policies  on  anticorruption 3   and  combating  of  money \n33. \nlaundering  and  financing  of  terrorism. 4  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance, \naccountability, and transparency, ADB will require CGH to institute, maintain, and comply with \n\n                                                 \n3   ADB. 1998.

\n\nTHE NATURAL GAS SECTOR  \n\n1. \nThe  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  is  the  world\u2019s  second  largest  energy  producer \nand  consumer  after  the  United  States.  Coal  has  historically  been  the  fuel  of  choice,  with \nabundant reserves located throughout the country. Many power stations are coal-fired, and coal \nis used for domestic cooking and heating.  \n \nIn 2004, coal remained the largest source of energy, comprising approximately 66% of \n2. \nthe total energy mix. Oil and petroleum products constituted 23%; other energy sources, such \nas hydro and other renewable accounting for 8%; and gas for 3%. \n \nNatural  gas  usage  in  the  PRC  is  set  to  grow  rapidly  as  natural  gas  is  (i) cleaner  than \n3. \nmost fuels, (ii) economic, and (iii) domestically abundant. The introduction of natural gas into the \npower  and  nonpower  sectors  will  significantly  reduce  emissions  of  particulates,  sulfur  dioxide \n(SO2),  nitrogen  oxide  (NOx),  and  carbon  dioxide  (CO2).The  price  of  natural  gas  is  lower  than \nmost other forms of fuel on a heat content-adjusted basis. For example, it is approximately 34\u2013\n88% lower than coal gas, approximately 38\u201352% cheaper than liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), \nand approximately 63\u201380% lower than electricity.  \n \n4. \nThe  PRC  has  abundant  natural  gas  reserves,  estimated  at  approximately  2.35  trillion \ncubic  meters  (tcm)  proven  natural  gas  reserves  in  2005. 5   The  Government  estimates  total \nreserves  of  natural  gas  at  approximately  38  tcm,  of  which  78.6%  are  onshore  and  21.4% \noffshore.  Onshore  natural  gas  reserves  are  mainly  concentrated  in  the  middle  and  western \nregions  of  the  PRC  such  as  Chongqing,  Gansu,  Sichuan,  Qinghai,  and  Xinjiang.  Offshore \nnatural gas reserves are mainly concentrated near the South China Sea. Onshore domestic gas \nproduction  is  concentrated  in  the  western  region,  and  undertaken  by  PetroChina  and  China \nPetroleum  &  Chemical  Corporation  (Sinopec).  Offshore  production  is  undertaken  by  China \nNational Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC).  \n \nGas Demand \n\n5. \nHistorically, natural gas has constituted a small proportion of the overall energy balance \nin  the  PRC.  Gas  utilization  was  heavily  concentrated  in  fertilizer  production  to  support \nagricultural  production,  with  little  or  no  gas  utilized  for  power  generation.  Consequently,  gas \ndemand between 1975 and 1990 remained relatively stable. Since 1990, gas demand increased \nas the economy grew. Gas consumption increased by 1.7 times in the 1990s. Demand growth \nhas accelerated since 1999, exceeding 10% annually except in 2002 following rapid economic \nexpansion. However, gas remains a small percentage of the energy mix.

By 2005, gas consumption had grown to approximately 47 billion cubic \nmeters (bcm) per annum; this is forecast to more than double by 2010. Demand will continue to \ngrow for the foreseeable future, with estimates, by the Energy Research Institute of the National \nDevelopment and Reform Commission, for natural gas demand to be approximately 120 bcm in \n2010 and 200 bcm in 2020, or 2.5 and 4.2 times the 2005 consumption.  \n \nForecasts  of  gas  demand  are  subject  to  a  high  degree  of  uncertainty,  as  gas \n7. \nconsumption depends heavily on the successful construction of trunk pipelines, and the rate of \ngas penetration in the power and nonpower sectors, especially the rate of conversion of existing \nmanufactured gas distribution and consumption facilities. However, all sources agree that strong \ngrowth  in  demand  will  be  felt  for  natural  gas  in  power  generation  and  residential  uses.

This  indicates  a  growth  rate  of  7.5%,  while  the  annual  growth  rate  for  natural  gas \ndemand is estimated to be 10.8% for the same period (Figure A2.3). The demand and supply \ngap  is  expected  to  be  met  by  imports,  which  will  be  achieved  via  international  pipelines  and \nliquefied natural gas (LNG).  \n \n\n \nFigure A2.3: Gas Demand and Production (2000\u20132020) \n\n \ny\n/\nm\nc\nb\n\nDemand\n\nProduction\n\n  \n\n                  bcm/y = billion cubic meter per year.  \n\n  Source: National Development and Reform C\n \n \n \n\nommission. \n\nSome estimates suggest that up to one third of the PRC\u2019s future gas requirements will \n9. \nbe  met  by  imports,  which  will  be  achieved  via  pipelines  and  LNG.  Several  possible  pipeline\n \nprojects are being considered; the largest is the pipeline project linking the natural gas reserves \nin  Siberia  of  the  Russian  Federation  to  the  PRC.  Other  supply  points  include  offshore  field\ns \neither  under  development  or  already  operating,  as  well  as  imported  LNG.  LNG  will  be  us\ned \nprimarily  in  the  PRC's  southeastern  coastal  regions,  with  possible \ne \nunder \nnortheast.  Guangdong  LNG  is  the  most  advanced  of  all  the  LNG  projects  in\nconsideration, expected to begin operations in 2006.  \n \nGas Distribution  \n\nlater  expansion  in  th\n  the  PRC \n\nn\n\n7,419  km).

This pattern is expected to continue as new fields and new transmission \ninfrastructure are developed. \n \n11. \nAccording  to  the  Ministry  of  Construction,  the  gas  distribution  subsector  supplied  8.2 \nbcm of natural gas, 15.2 bcm of manufactured coal gas, and 10.5 million tons of LPG in 2000. A \ntotal of 176.3 million people were supplied with gas, accounting for 84% of the country\u2019s urban \n(or nonagricultural) population.

According to the latter, all gases had only about 20 million residential customers in \n2000, which corresp\n \n12. \nIn 2000, only about 15 large cities and some small ones were supplied with natural gas. \nIn  2005,  140  cities  were  supplied  with  natural  gas  compared  with  60  in  2003.  The  number  of \ncities  using  natural  gas  is  expected  to  increase  to  270  in  2010,  and  city  gas  distribution  will \nconsume  41.4  bcm  of  natural  gas;  a  volume  that  will  represent  about  35%  of  the  total  natural \ngas consumption in the country.  \n \n1\nRegardless  of  the  statistics  of  the  current  penetration  rate  for  gas  usage,  the  market \npotential  for  natural  gas  in  urban  areas  remains  substantial.
