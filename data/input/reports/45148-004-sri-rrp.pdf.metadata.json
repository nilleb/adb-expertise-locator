For investments in physical infrastructure to \nbe  effective  and  sustainable, the  investment  program  will  assist the government  in  introducing \ninstitutional reforms in the water and wastewater subsectors, particularly in Greater Colombo.3\n \n\n  \n\nII. \n\nTHE INVESTMENT PROGRAM \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \nWater. About 95% of Colombo,4 the capital city and economic and administrative hub of \n2. \nthe  country,  is  covered  by  a  piped  water  supply  system.  Because  the  system  has  low  and \nfluctuating system pressure and intermittent supply, some areas of the city receive water only in \noff-peak hours and others receive water for an average of only 6\u201310 hours a day. Many parts of \nthe distribution network were built more than 100 years ago.5 Though there have been various \nprojects to address the increasing water demand, significant network rehabilitation has not been \ncarried  out;  nonrevenue  water  (NRW)  remains  around  49%.6\n The  National  Water  Supply  and \nDrainage Board (NWSDB), under the Ministry of Water Supply and Drainage (MWSD), supplies \npiped  water  to  127,000  metered  service  connections  in  Colombo;  in  the  underserved \nsettlements,  about  3,200  standposts  are  not  metered.  The  water  tariff  is  below  full  cost \nrecovery.  To  enhance  water  conservation  through  the  standposts  in  underserved  settlements, \nNWSDB  has  launched  various  pilot  programs  across  the  country  and  specifically  in  Colombo. \nThese programs need to be implemented on a larger scale. \n \n3. \nWastewater.  According to  the  United  Nations  Development  Programme,  in  2008,  66% \nof the Greater Colombo population had on-site sanitation facilities; 25% had sewerage systems; \nand  9%  had  no  facilities  and  disposed  of  waste  on  the  seashore,  into  canals  and  waterways, \nand on available open ground. The various sewerage systems operating within Greater Colombo \nare  currently  estimated  to  serve  140,000  households.  The  sewer  network,  built  from  1906  to \n2007, comprises about 320 kilometers (km) of sewers, 18 pumping stations in two catchments \n(north and south), and two sea outfalls. The sewer lines have frequent collapses and blockages, \nand  one-third  of  the  pumping  facilities  are  not  working,  causing  frequent  overflow  into \nwatercourses.  The  Colombo  Municipal  Council  (CMC)  owns  and  operates  the  wastewater \ninfrastructure services in Colombo, and is the only municipal body handling such service in the \ncountry. NWSDB manages wastewater facilities outside the CMC area. NWSDB has introduced \na  sewerage  tariff  within  its  operating  jurisdiction  and  has  a  dedicated  account  for  sewerage \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  Greater Colombo comprises 15 local authorities: five municipal councils (Colombo, Dehiwela\u2013Mount Lavinia, and \nSri Jayawardenepura\u2013Kotte, Kaduwela, and Moratuwa), five urban councils, and five pradeshiya sabhas (smallest \npolitical  units  in  peri-urban  or rural  areas).  It  has  a  population  of more  than  838,000  and  a  floating  population  of \nmore than 500,000. \n\n3  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  provided  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  (PPTA)  for  the  Colombo \n\nWater Supply Service Improvement Project in 2011. Supplementary PPTA was provided in 2012. \n\n4  The 37 square kilometer area under the Colombo Municipal Council has a population of about 700,000. \n5  About 700 kilometers (km) of the 927 km of water supply distribution network in Colombo is more than 50 years old. \n6  The  49%  NRW  for  Colombo,  which  is  twice  the  national  average  NRW,  comprises  33%  physical  losses,  5% \n\ncommercial losses, and 11% free water supplied to low-income informal settlements. \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nfor  Greater  Colombo \n\nSector  constraints.  The  key  sector  constraints \n\nservices.7\n However, the sewerage operation in CMC is not separate from other operations and \nCMC  has  no  independent  accounting  for  its  sewerage  operation.  Aside  from  property  taxes, \nCMC does not impose a separate wastewater tariff. \n \nNRW reduction. NWSDB\u2019s limited network rehabilitation and leak repairs under routine \n4. \noperation and maintenance (O&M) have had little impact on NRW reduction. A focused program \nof pipe replacement and metering, implemented in a small part of the critical area8 in Colombo \nwith  funding  from  the  Japan  International  Cooperation  Agency  (JICA), 9\nbrought  about  local \nimprovements. According to the water balance for Colombo dated January 2012, the estimated \nannual  revenue  losses  associated  with  NRW  are  more  than  SLRs1.7  billion  ($13 million). The \ngovernment recognizes that focused efforts, including citywide NRW reduction and institutional \nreforms, are needed to improve service and increase water availability in Colombo, and manage \nthe increasing demand. However, these plans are hampered by lack of budget and institutional \nreforms.  The  high  rate  of  NRW  remains  the  greatest  obstacle  to  improving  NWSDB\u2019s \nperformance and financial viability. \n \ninclude \n5. \n(i) inefficient and unreliable infrastructure performance, as a result of inadequate asset planning \nand  management  and  associated  investments,  (ii)  inadequate  and  fragmented  organizational \nstructures  that  do  not  promote  accountability  and  performance,  (iii)  low  cost  recovery  (for \nsewerage), and (iv) inadequate operating and monitoring capacity of service providers. \n \n6. \nRoad  map.  The  MFF  is  to  support  the  government  in  achieving  its  water  supply  and \nwastewater sector targets under its development policy framework (DPF), which has objectives \nto  (i)  reduce  and  manage  NRW  holistically  and  sustainably;  (ii)  improve  governance, \nmanagement capacity, and accountability within NWSDB and CMC; and (iii) improve water and \nwastewater  service  delivery  and  amounts  in  Greater  Colombo.  10\n It  includes  plans  to  increase \nthe national coverage of piped water supply from 37% to 60%, and piped sewerage from 2.5% \nto  7%  during  2010\u20132020.  Improving  municipal  services,  specifically  in  water  supply  and \nwastewater,  is  a  key  government  priority.  The  government  recognizes  that  focused  efforts, \nincluding Colombo citywide NRW reduction and institutional reforms, are necessary to improve \nservice and increase water availability in Colombo to manage increasing demand. \n \n7. \nPolicy and regulatory framework. Under the DPF, in 2010 MWSD adopted the National \nDrinking  Water  Policy  and  the  National  Policy  on  Sanitation  to  provide  guidance  to  NWSDB, \nprovincial  councils,  local  authorities,  lending  institutions,  and  organizations  involved  in \ndelivering water supply and sanitation services. In 2003, Parliament authorized the formation of \nthe  Public  Utilities  Commission  to  regulate  electricity,  petroleum,  and  water  tariffs.  Despite \nseveral  drafts  of  the  NWSDB  Water  Bill  and  amendments  to  the  NWSDB  Act,  water  tariff \nregulation  is  still  not  in  place  under  the  commission.  But  even  without  an  independent  water \nregulatory framework, NWSDB still managed to increase tariffs to meet operating requirements, \nmost recently in 2009. Further tariff increases are necessary for full cost recovery. \n\n                                                \n7  The cabinet approved the introduction of a sewerage charge in September 2002. Subsequently, NWSDB approved \na sewerage tariff policy and a specific tariff structure, which MWSD approved. A new sewerage tariff was gazetted \nin October 2007 and implemented in March 2008. As part of system computerization at NWSDB, the water bill form \nwas modified and the sewerage charge was incorporated into the water bill. \n\n8  North  of  Colombo  and  covering  12  square  km,  the  area  comprises  Kotahena,  Modera,  Grandpass,  and \n\nMattakkuliya. \n\n9  The  JICA  project  includes  replacement  of  pipes,  provision  of  individual  connections,  renewal  of  service \n\nconnections, and geographic information system mapping. \n\n10 Government of Sri Lanka. 2010. Mahinda Chintana: Vision for a New Sri Lanka, 2010\u20132020, Colombo. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n3 \n\n \n8. \nGovernment  strategy  and  investment  plan.  To  achieve  the  DPF  targets  for  water \nsupply  and  sanitation for  Greater  Colombo,  NWSDB  and  CMC  need to  provide  the  population \nwith  (i) full  coverage  and  24-hour  water  supply  in  Colombo  and  universal  safe  water  supply  in \nGreater  Colombo;  and  (ii)  universal  sanitation  coverage  in  Greater  Colombo,  with  100% \nconnection to public sewers in Colombo. NWSDB and CMC have adopted an investment plan \ncomprising intervention and project requirements to achieve these targets.11\n The plan envisions \ninvestments  of  $1,500  million  in  2010\u20132020.  NWSDB\u2019s  corporate  plan  (2012\u20132016)  includes \ngoals of increasing water supply and sanitation coverage and improving business efficiency and \nservices  to  customers.  The  business  efficiency  objectives  specifically  target  NRW  reduction  in \nColombo and nationally. \n \nInvestment program. The investment program will support the government in achieving \n9. \nits  water  supply  and  wastewater  targets  under  the  DPF  for  Greater  Colombo.  Supplementing \nongoing  projects  and  expected  funds  from  other  development  partners,  such  as  JICA  and \nNWSDB, Asian Development Bank (ADB) financing of $300 million under the MFF will provide \n100% of the investment needed to achieve the water supply targets ($164 million) and 85% of \nthe investment needed to achieve the wastewater targets ($136 million) for Colombo. The MFF, \ntherefore, will fund about 20% of the $1,500 million financing needed by the government under \nits  investment  plan  for  water  and  sanitation  in  Greater  Colombo.  Global  best  practice  and \nproven  approaches  to  NRW  reduction  will  be  used  to  reduce  NRW,  from  the  current  49%  to \n20%  in  Colombo,  and  from  about  60%  to  18%  in  critical  areas,  by  the  end  of  the  investment \nprogram  in  2020.  Wastewater  will  meet  the  discharge  target  set  by  the  Central  Environment \nAuthority.  \n \n10.  MFF  and  tranches.  The  MFF  modality  was  selected  to  allow  phased  implementation \nand  funding  of  individual  projects  when  they  are  ready,  subject  to  eligibility  and  readiness  of \nsubprojects included in the investment program. The requirements for an MFF are in place. The \ngovernment  has  prepared  a  sector  strategy  supported  by  an  investment  plan  for  the  next  \n8 years.12\n The MFF will be sequenced: (i) tranche 1: $84 million for project 1 in 2012; (ii) tranche \n2:  $80  million  for  project  2  in  2013;  (iii)  tranche  3:  $100  million  for  project  3  in  2015;  and  (iv) \ntranche  4:  $36  million for  project  4  in  2016.  Projects  1  and  2  will focus on  reducing  NRW and \nimproving water service efficiency in Colombo. Project 1 will be implemented from 2012 to 2016. \nProjects 3 and 4 will support improved wastewater services, including treatment, and expansion \nof  service  coverage  in  Greater  Colombo.  The  government  has  asked  ADB  for  assistance  in \nexploring possibilities for cofinancing under the investment plan.  \n \nADB strategy. ADB is one of the major development partners13 involved in water supply \n11. \nand sanitation in Sri Lanka, providing eight loan projects for a total of about $521 million since \n1986.  Lessons 14\n from  the  involvement  of  ADB  and  other  development  partners  were \nincorporated into the investment program design. The investment program is consistent with the \npriority  assigned  by  ADB  and  the  government  to  the  water  supply  and  other  municipal \n\n                                                \n11 Further  details  of  the  investment  plan  are  provided  in  Schedule  1  of  the  Framework  Financing  Agreement \n\n(accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n12 Schedule 1 of the Framework Financing Agreement (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n13 Other contributors to NRW reduction in Colombo are JICA and NWSDB. \n14 These  are  extracted  from  various  sources  including:  ADB.  2007.

Various  preparatory  steps,  such  as  preparing  the  water  supply  master \nplan,24 and network GIS mapping and modeling in Colombo, will be completed by October 2012 \nwith  support from  JICA.25\n The  investment  program  will  validate  the  GIS mapping  and calibrate \nthe network model. Least-cost options were selected for all designs and measures.  \n \nNRW  reduction  monitoring.  In  line  with  current  global  best  practice,  the  investment \n24. \nprogram will engage a consulting team to manage, coordinate, and oversee all NRW reduction \nactivities in Colombo. Special provisions for NRW reduction will be developed and incorporated \ninto the NRW reduction civil works bidding documents to ensure achievement of specific targets. \nThe NRW specialist will  ensure that funds are used efficiently and that RSC-WC and NWSDB \nreceive the most appropriate solutions from investment program contractors and consultants. In-\nhouse  capacity  will  be  developed  to  ensure  that  RSC-WC  and  NWSDB  can  continue  a \nsustained NRW program, through training and the setting up of a dedicated NRW facility. \n \nB. \n \n25. \nThe estimated financial internal rate of return (FIRR) for the water supply improvement \nproject, including projects 1 and 2, is 6.25%; the net present value is $75 million at the weighted \naverage  cost  of  capital  (WACC)  of  2.95%.  The  FIRR  is  higher  than  the  WACC,  indicating  a \nreasonable  financial  return.  The  result  is  robust  against  downside  risks,  as  assessed  in  the \nsensitivity  analysis,  with  (i)  capital  costs  increased  by  20%,  (ii)  O&M  costs  increased  by  20%, \n(iii)  revenues  reduced  by  20%,  and  (iv)  project  implementation  delayed  by  1 year.  The  FIRR \nvaries from 4.32% to 5.54%; it is 2.12% when all risks are assumed to occur at the same time. \nThe  most  sensitive  risk  factor  is  a  decrease  in  revenues,  followed  by  capital  cost  overrun. \n                                                \n24 JICA is financing the master plan project. \n25 Network  mapping  of  a  part  of  the  Colombo  service  area  was  done  in  the  1970s  with  support  from  the  North \nAmerican  Aerospace  Defense  Command,  but  has  not  been  maintained  or  updated.  More  recently,  GIS  mapping \nwas set up in certain areas of Colombo where JICA has carried out network improvements. \n\nEconomic and Financial  \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nCommunity  participation  approaches  will  be  used  to  register  users  and  establish  consumer \nsocieties  for  better  billing  and  collection  controls.  According  to  the  current  tariff  schedule,  with \nmoderate  increases, 26\n average  monthly  water  bills  will  account  for  about  2.5%  of  the  mean \nmonthly  income  of  low-income  households,  well  below  the  5%  threshold  generally  considered \nas an affordable user charge. The water improvement project is financially viable and affordable \nto all, including poor households. \n \n26. \nAn  economic  analysis  was  conducted  for  projects  1  and  2  of  the  investment  program. \nThe estimated economic internal rate of return (EIRR) for the combined projects is 16.9%; the \nnet present value is $44 million at the economic opportunity cost of capital of 12%. The EIRR is \nhigher than the economic opportunity cost of capital, indicating a sufficient economic return. The \nresult  is  robust  against downside  risks,  including  (i) capital cost  overrun  of  20%, (ii) O&M  cost \noverrun  of  20%,  (iii)  benefits  reduced  by  20%,  and  (iv)  project  implementation  delayed  by  1 \nyear. The EIRRs range from 13.4% to 16.6% in the sensitivity analysis; the EIRR is 10% when \nall  risks  are  assumed  to  occur  at  the  same  time.  Sensitivity  analysis  shows  that  EIRRs  are \ngenerally  robust  to  the  downside  risks  and  are  most  sensitive  to  a  reduction  in  benefits. \nSatisfactory  project  benefits  are considered  attainable,  as  the  large  and  growing  population  of \nGreater Colombo, including the floating population of 500,000, will benefit from expanded water \nsupply service coverage as a result of the water improvement project, which will provide about \n30 million cubic meters of water per year to enhance the water supply system. \n \nC. \n\nGovernance  \n\n27. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government, MWSD, and MLGPC. The specific policy requirements and supplementary \nmeasures are described in the FAM. Risk was  assessed using a governance risk assessment \ntool. Given the risks identified, some of the mitigation measures incorporated in project design \nare to (i) establish a mechanism for regular voluntary disclosure of investment program-related \ninformation to citizens, (ii) develop and utilize e-procurement system, (iii) develop and update an \ninvestment program website to enhance transparency during implementation, and (iv) establish \na  grievance  redress  mechanism  to  ensure  quick  and  effective  relief.  The  investment  program \nwill  increase  the  decentralization  of  NWSDB  functions  by  delegating  all  functions  related  to \nGreater  Colombo\u2019s  water  supply  to  the  RSC-WC,  including  investment  planning,  construction, \nand O&M of water supply operations, as recommended under the ADB technical assistance.27\n \nD. \n\nPoverty and Social  \n\n \n\n28. \nThe  investment  program  will  improve  water  supply  and  sanitation  services  in  poor  and \nnon-poor areas of Greater Colombo, enabling equitable access. It will improve the participation \nof  low-income  communities  in  water  conservation,  especially  women  in  the  formation  of  water \nuser  groups.28\n Project  1  is  classified  as  effective  gender  mainstreaming.  A  gender  action  plan \n(GAP)  prepared \nfor \nmainstreaming  gender  equity  into  the  project  design,  including  physical  and  institutional \ncomponents  related  to  water  and  sanitation  services.  The  consultation  and  participation  plan \n(CPP)  outlines  specific  outreach  activities  to  raise  awareness  and  ensure  the  meaningful \nin  the  project  area.

Project 1 is classified under category B for involuntary resettlement \nand  category  C for  indigenous  peoples  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement \n(2009). A draft resettlement plan endorsed by the government was prepared and disclosed for \nproject 1 in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement to address potential temporary \nincome losses within the project area during linear pipe rehabilitation works, including temporary \ndisruption  of  approximately  7,600  mobile  vendors  and  hawkers for  less than  7  days.  Full  road \nclosure is not anticipated and work in busy commercial areas will be done during nonbusiness \nhours (i.e., nighttime) to the extent possible. Counterpart funds are budgeted to compensate for \npotential income losses before displacement. NWSDB has implemented previous ADB projects \nand  is  familiar  with  ADB\u2019s  safeguard  policies;  however,  the  management  advisory  and \nsupervision consultants will provide additional capacity support to counterpart staff new to ADB \nprojects  and  to  help  manage  and  monitor  resettlement  impacts  and  social  risks  during  the \ninvestment program. The project management unit (PMU) will provide social safeguard reports \nto ADB every 6 months. A resettlement framework was prepared to guide resettlement planning \nin  future  tranches.  Considering  the  urban  setting  of  the  project  and  socioeconomic  survey \nresults  within  the  investment  program  area,  no  impacts  on  indigenous  peoples  are  expected, \nand an indigenous peoples planning framework is not required. 29\n \nEnvironmental  safeguards.  Project  1  is  classified  under  category  B  for  environment. \n30. \nAn environmental assessment and review framework was prepared to guide the preparation of \nfuture tranches, and an initial environmental examination30\n with an environmental management \nplan  was  prepared  for  project  1  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  and \ngovernment  laws.  The  draft  initial  environmental  examination  concludes  that  no  significant \nadverse  impact  is  anticipated  as  a  result  of  the  water  distribution  network  improvements,  and \nthat net environmental benefits to Colombo\u2019s population will be positive and large as a result of \nthe  increased  reliability  of  water  supply.  It  outlines  a  grievance  redress  mechanism  to  ensure \neasy  and  quick  redress  of  any  complaints  or  concerns  during  project  implementation.  The \nenvironmental  management  plan  provides  adequate  mitigation  measures  for  any  foreseen \nconstruction impact, including traffic management to ensure limited disruption to traffic flow and \naccess. Support from the management advisory and supervision consultants will ensure that the \nPMU  has  adequate  capacity  to  manage  any  environmental  impact  during  detailed  design  and \nconstruction. The PMU will provide ADB with a report on environmental issues every 6 months. \n \nF. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n  \n\n31.
