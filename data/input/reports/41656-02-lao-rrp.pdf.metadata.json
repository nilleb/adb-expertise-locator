An  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE)  was \nundertaken for the supplementary grant. \n \nThe  proposed  supplementary  grant  will  fulfill  the  expected \noutcome  and  outputs  of  the  project.  It  will  improve  about \n367 kilometers  (km)  of  Route  4  (the  project  road)  from  Xiang- \nNgeun to Nakha, construction of a bridge over the Mekong River \non  the  project  road,  and  improvement  of  about  100  km  of  rural \naccess roads in the project area. The project will also (i) support \nmaintenance  of  the  national  road  network  by  providing  financing \nfor  periodic  road  maintenance,  (ii)  improve  road  safety  by \nfinancing consulting services to continue the ongoing road safety \nassistance program, and (iii) finance a program to reduce the risks \nof HIV/AIDS/sexually transmitted infections and human trafficking \nthat  may  develop  during  the  improvement  and  operation  of  the \nproject  road.  The  project  will  support  regional  cooperation \nbetween  the  Lao  PDR  and  Thailand  by  facilitating  cross-border \ntraffic movement on border crossings between the two countries. \nThe  supplementary  grant  will  finance  cost  and  quantity  overruns \nfor the improvement of Route 4, including road widening of 60 km. \n \nPoor  basic  infrastructure  is  a  major  impediment  to  subregional \neconomic  cooperation.  The  Lao  PDR  is  pivotal  to  the  Greater \nMekong  Subregion  transport  corridors  linking  northern  Thailand, \nnorthern  Viet  Nam,  and  the  southern  provinces  of  the  People\u2019s \nRepublic of China. Improving routes that connect provinces in the \nLao PDR  will  enhance  subregional  connections  between  the \nnorthern  Lao  PDR  and  surrounding  countries,  as  well  as \neconomic growth and poverty reduction within the Lao PDR.  \n \nThe  project  was  approved  on  27  September  2007,  and \nprocurement activities were started in 28 June 2007. Invitations to \nbid on civil works packages for sections 2, 3, 4 and 5 were issued \nin March 2008. The closing date for bids was July 2008.

The \nincrease  in  project  costs  results  from  (i)  price  increases,  and \n(ii) the  increase  in  civil  works  quantities  between  those  used  at \nappraisal  based  on  the  preliminary  project  preparatory  technical \nassistance design and those in the detailed designs carried out by \nthe civil works contractors, and for widening 60 km of section 5. \n \nThe  project  will  facilitate  regional  cooperation  and  increased \neconomic growth in the  Greater  Mekong Subregion by improving \nthe  national  highway  linking  the  Louangphrabang  area  with  the \nLao  PDR\u2013Thailand  border.  Improvement  of  this  road,  much  of \nwhich  currently  has  a  gravel  and  earth  surface,  and  rural access \nroads  will  facilitate  increased  exports  to  Thailand  of  agricultural \ngoods  produced  in  the  project  area  and  increased  tourism  from \nThailand  to  Louangphrabang.  The  impact  of  the  project  will  be \nincreased trade and economic growth in the project area and the \nregion.  The  outcome  will  be  more  efficient  transport  on  the \nregional and national road networks. \n \nThe  revised  investment  cost  of  the  project  is  estimated  at \n$118.6 million, including taxes and duties of $8.1 million. \n \n\nSource \nAsian Development Bank \nOPEC Fund for International \n\nBase \n27.0 \n11.0 \n\nSupp \n27.0 \n0.0 \n\nTotal \n54.0 \n11.0 \n\n% \n45.5 \n9.3 \n\nDevelopment \n\n0.0 \n0.0 \n\n14.5 \n22.4 \n\n14.5 \n22.4 \n\n12.2 \n18.9 \n\n13.6 \n88.5 \n\n3.1 \n30.1 \n\n16.7 \n118.6 \n\n14.1 \n100.0 \n\nGovernment of Australia \nGovernment of the  \nRepublic of Korea  \nGovernment of the Lao PDRa \n       Total \na  Includes $8.1 million in taxes and duties. \nin  Asian  Development  Bank.  2007.

The  supervision  consultants  were  selected \nin  accordance  with  the  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants \n(2007, as amended from time to time) of the Asian Development \nBank  (ADB).  The  supervision  consultants  have  been  mobilized \nand will continue to function in accordance with their original terms \nof reference. Consulting services for the HIV/AIDS awareness and \nprevention of human trafficking program will be recruited using the \nquality-  and  cost-based  selection  method  and  biodata  technical \nproposal.  A  national  consultant  will  be  recruited  as  an  individual \nconsultant  for  the  external  resettlement  monitor  assignment.  All \nconsulting  services  will  be  recruited  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants. \n \nProject  benefits  include  vehicle  operating  cost  savings,  time \nsavings,  diverted  traffic,  saving  from  improved  road  safety,  and \nsavings  from  reduced  maintenance  costs.  An  estimate  of  the \nproject\u2019s  economic  viability  was  prepared,  based  on  assessment \nof  the  direct  benefits  and  costs.  The  project\u2019s  revised  economic \ninternal rate of return is estimated at 19.4%.  \n \nThe  major  risks  identified  for  the  original  grant  also  apply  to  the \nsupplementary grant. The project is formulated to minimize these \nrisks  during  and  after  project \nimplementation.  The  most \nidentifiable  risk  is  that  the  road  may  not  be  properly  maintained, \nbut  the  emphasis  of  ADB  and  other  international  institutions  on \nand  the commitment  of  the  government  to  road  maintenance  will \naddress \nincome \nrestoration measures relating to involuntary resettlement might not \nbe delivered on time, thereby delaying the start of civil works. The \ngender  strategy  includes  consultation  workshops  for  the  affected \nhouseholds to increase their understanding of resettlement issues \nsuch  as  entitlements,  compensation,  and  the  grievance  process. \nThe project supervision consultants will include specialists to help \nMPWT  manage  resettlement,  environmental  impacts,  and  ethnic \nminority  specific  activities  and  ensure  that  ADB\u2019s  safeguard \npolicies are complied with.

The  design  and \nmonitoring framework is in Appendix 1. Coordination among development partners is described \nin Appendix 2.   \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE APPROVED PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nProject Rationale \n\nEnhanced  subregional  economic  cooperation  requires  improved  connections  across \n2. \ncountries  and  between  centers  of  economic  activity.  The  Lao  PDR  is  pivotal  to  the  GMS \ntransport corridors linking northern Thailand, northern Viet Nam, and the southern provinces of \nthe People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC). Improving routes that connect provinces in the Lao PDR \nto  each  other  and  to  borders  will  enhance  subregional  connections  between  the  northern \nLao PDR and surrounding countries. The GMS Transport Sector Strategy Study1 identified the \nproject as a high priority transport project that will link the northern Lao PDR with Thailand. \n \nFuture development of the Lao PDR economy will depend on expanding and upgrading \n3. \nconnections with its neighboring GMS countries2 to provide linkages that will enable transport of \nproduce and goods to local and international markets. The project will form part of the new GMS \nNortheastern  Corridor  (encompassing  Nanning  in  Guangxi  Province,  PRC;  Hanoi  and \nThanh Hoa  in  Viet  Nam;  Louangphrabang,  Lao  PDR;  and  Bangkok,  Thailand)  which  was \nidentified  in  the  GMS  Transport  Sector  Strategy  Study.  The  upgrading  of  the  project  road  will \nconnect  (i)  districts  in  central  and  southern  Xaignabouli  province,  (ii)  the  provincial  capitals  of \nLouangphrabang  and  Xaignabouli  with  a  sealed  all-weather  road,  and  (iii)  the  border  crossing \nwith Thailand near Kenethao with the GMS corridors that converge on Louangphrabang. These \nconnections  will  reduce  transport  costs  from  the  important  agricultural  areas  in  southern \nXaignabouli  to  markets  in  Thailand.  The  government  considers  road  access  to  be  one  of  the \nkeys  to  eradicating  poverty,  and  it  is  a  major  focus  of  the  National  Growth  and  Poverty \nEradication Strategy.3   \n \nB. \n\nObjectives and Scope \n\nIn  September  2007,  the  government  and  ADB  reached  an  agreement  on  the  impact, \n4. \noutcome, outputs, cost estimates and financing plan, and the implementation arrangements for \nthe Northern Greater Mekong Subregional Transport Network Improvement Project.4 The project \nwill  improve  about  367  kilometers  (km)  of  Route  4,  including  a  new  bridge  over  the  Mekong \nRiver,  and  improvement  of  about  100  km  of  rural  access  roads  in  the  project  area.  The  main \nproject outcome will be more efficient transport on the regional and national road networks. The \nproject  consists  of  (i)  civil  works  to  improve  five  sections  of  Route  4  from  Xiang-Nguen  in  the \nnorth  to  Nakha  at  the  border  with  Thailand  in  the  south,  and  a  new  bridge  over  the  Mekong \nRiver; (ii) civil works to improve about 100 km of rural access roads; (iii) provision of funding for \n\n                                                 \n1   ADB. 2004.

The  government  has  complied  with  all  grant \nassurances for which compliance is due. The Project Management Division of the Department \nof  Roads  (DOR)  of  the  Ministry  of  Public  Works  and  Transport  (MPWT)  is  responsible  for \nmanaging  the  project.  The  construction  supervision  consultant  was  mobilized  in  September \n2008.  Invitations  for  bid  for  sections  2\u20135  were  issued  in  March  2008.1 The  closing  date  of  all \nbids was in July 2008. Civil works contracts for sections 2\u20135 were signed on 3 December 2008. \nDetailed  design  of  the  civil  works  contractors  commenced  shortly  thereafter,  and  was  largely \ncompleted by mid-2009. At appraisal, the cost of the total length of the four sections, 308.1 km, \nwas estimated at $37.2 million. The total of the winning bids (based on preliminary design level \nquantities)  for  the  four  sections  totaled  $47.4  million,  an  increase  of  27%  over  the  estimated \namount.  The  detailed  design  for  the  four  sections  ultimately  totaled  306.9  km  in  length,  and \nrequired  significantly  higher  quantities  of  many  items.  The  estimated  construction  cost  rose  to \n$67.4 million\u2014an overall increase between appraisal and completion of detailed design of 81%. \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED SUPPLEMENTARY GRANT \n\n8. \nThe  proposed  supplementary  grant  will  finance  the  increased  costs  of  the  civil  works \ncontracts  for  sections  2\u20135.  The  increase  in  civil  works  costs  is  due  to  (i)  unit  price  increases, \nand  (ii)  the  increase  in  civil  works  quantities  between  those  used  at  appraisal  based  on  the \npreliminary  project  preparatory  technical  assistance 2 (TA)  design  and  those  specified  in  the \ndetailed designs carried out by the civil works contractors, and widening of 60 km of section 5. \nThe  unit  price  increases  comprise  about  30%  of  the  increase  in  civil  works  costs,  while  the \nincrease in civil works quantities comprise about 70%. \n \nA. \n\nCost Overruns \n\n1. \n\nUnit Price Increases  \n\n9. \nUnit prices used during the TA were based on prevailing material prices in the Lao PDR \nin  July  2007.  The  final  bid  unit  prices  were  based  on  representative  domestic  prices  for \nJuly 2008, which was essentially at the peak of a large worldwide spike in crude oil prices. From \nJuly  2007  to  July  2008,  there  were  very  significant  increases  in  the  cost  of  construction \nmaterials in the Lao PDR. For example, bitumen increased by 39%, cement rose by 11%, and \n\n                                                 \n1   Section 1 is financed by parallel financing from the Government of the Republic of Korea. There has been no cost \n\noverrun on this section. \n\n2   ADB.  2005.

Further details on unit prices for the civil works contracts are in \nAppendix 3. \n \n\n2. \n\nQuantity Increases and Other Factors \n\nImplementation of the project has been based on a design-build concept. The estimated \n10. \ncosts of civil works in the original report and recommendation of the President were based on \npreliminary quantities as determined during the TA. Civil works bids were then based on these \npreliminary  quantities.  After  bidding  and  award  of  the  civil  works  contracts,  the  selected \ncontractors  carried  out  detailed  designs  that  determined  final  contract  bid  quantities  for  each \nunit price item, and final civil works contract amounts. During the 1.5\u20132.0 year period between \nthe completion of the preliminary designs and the completion of the detailed designs, there were \nvery  significant  changes  in  the  road  condition.  The  causes  of  the  extensive  damage  to  the \nexisting  roadway  between  appraisal  and  detailed  design  were  primarily  due  to  (i)  large \nincreases in traffic volumes, particularly heavily loaded trucks; and (ii) two severe rainy seasons \nthat damaged the unpaved road and increased the requirement for routine maintenance at the \nend  of  these  two  wet  seasons,  which  the  government  was  unable  to  provide.  Changes  in  the \nroad condition primarily affected final quantities for earthworks, the pavement structural section \nand drainage items. Among the most important was the widespread deterioration of the existing \nunsealed road, which required significant increases in embankment, subbase, and base course \nmaterials over original estimates. The deterioration of the existing roadway was most acute on \nsection  5.  During  the  preliminary  design,  a  large  number  of  existing  drainage  structures  were \nconsidered to be adequate, only requiring cleaning and extension under the road improvement \nproject.  However,  during  the  detailed  design  phase,  it  was  determined  that  many  of  these \ndrainage structures had also deteriorated and become damaged by heavy runoff flows.3 Many \nof the drainage structures thought to be salvageable could not be salvaged, and needed to be \nreplaced.   \n \n11. \nIn  addition,  between  the  time  of  the  TA  and  the  period  of  detailed  design  the  design \nvehicle axle load in the country was increased from 9.1 tons to 11.0 tons, an increase of 21%. \nThe  revised  axle  load  is  consistent  with  the  standards  on  other  GMS  transport  corridors.  This \nincrease  required  increased  thickness  of  subbase  and  base  courses  of  the  project  road  to \nsatisfy these new design criteria.  \n \n12. \nAfter  completion  of  the  detailed  design  by  the  civil  works  contractors,  MPWT  and  the \nsupervision consultants undertook a review of the detailed designs on sections 2\u20135. Taking into \nconsideration  the  recent  and  forecasted  increases  in  traffic  volumes  on  section  5,  MPWT \ndecided  to  modify  the  cross-sectional  design  for  section  5.  The  original  detailed  design  for  60 \nkm  of  section  5  was  based  on  a  5.5  m  formation:  5.5  m  of  pavement,  with  no  provision  for \nshoulders. Since it is contemplated that the pavement width of section 5 will have to be widened \nin the very near future to accommodate already increased traffic and projected traffic increases, \nthe  width  of  60  km  of  section  5  will  be  increased  under  the  present  civil  works  contract,  to  a \nformation of 8.0 m, with a pavement width of 7.0 m and two 0.5 m wide shoulders4. Drainage \nstructures  will  also  be  widened.  In  addition,  a  new  0.6  km  bypass  will  be  constructed  and  an \nexisting 2.0 km bypass will be improved on section 5. \n\n                                                 \n3   Rainfall during 2008\u20132009 was higher than normal. The hydrology and runoff characteristics of many catch basins \n\nalong the road have changed as a result of heavy recent deforestation, hence higher runoff volumes.   \n\n4   The remaining 23 kilometers of section 5 already have a width of 8.0 meters. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n5\n\n \n\n \n\n3. \n\nRegional Cooperation \n\n13. \nSince  project  appraisal  in  2007,  there  has  been  a  significant  increase  in  cooperation \nbetween  the  governments  of  the  Lao  PDR  and  Thailand.  This  cooperation  has  included  the \nprovision  of  bilateral  economic  assistance  to  the  Lao  PDR  from  Thailand,  much  of  which  is \nbeing provided to the transport sector. A number of these cooperative initiatives are having, and \nwill continue to have, a major impact on the project. Some of the most important project-related \nregional  developments  are  (i)  the  recently  approved  new  Phoudou  border  crossing,  including \nthe improvement of the 30 km road in the Lao PDR from Phoudou to Paklay, both components \nto be financed by a Government of Thailand grant, which is expected to be implemented by the \nend of 2011; (ii) the new Nong Pachip border crossing that is presently at the planning stage at \nthe  provincial  level,  and  scheduled  for  opening  in  2010;  and  (iii)  the  proposed  new  border \ncrossing  at  the  southern  terminus  of  section  5,  with  the  construction  of  the  Nakha  Lao\u2013Thai \nFriendship  Bridge  over  the  Hueng  River.  The  new  bridge  will  be  financed  under  a  grant  from \nThailand, with tentative implementation in 2011\u20132012. All three of these projects will open new \nborder  crossings  between  the  two  countries,  and  will  have  a  major  influence  on  both  traffic \npatterns and traffic volumes in the project area, particularly along sections 4 and 5. Not only will \ntraffic  be  generated  between  the  two  countries,  there  will  also  be  significant  diverted  traffic. \nGenerated  traffic  will  include  traffic  to  and  from  northern  Thailand  and  both  Louangphrabang \n(along the project road) and Vientiane. There will also be diverted traffic from northern Thailand \n(Chiangmai,  Nan,  and  Uttaradit)  through  the  Lao  PDR,  destined  for  the  provinces  of  Loei, \nLom Sak, Udorn, and Nongkhai in northeastern Thailand.   \n \nB. \n\nImpact on the Project \n\n The  cost  and  quantity  overruns  have  posed  a  major  risk  to  the  timely  and  successful \n14. \ncompletion of the project, particularly civil works on sections 2\u20135. The proposed supplementary \ngrant will support the original project objectives, outcomes, and outputs. \n \nC. \n\nRationale \n\n15. \nThe proposed supplementary grant is in compliance with ADB\u2019s policy for supplementary \nfinancing.5 The proposed supplementary grant is to cover the project cost overrun. The project \nwill  support  the  government  to  complete  the  improvement  of  Route  4,  part  of  the  GMS \nNortheastern  Corridor,  by  2013.  Expanding  and  upgrading  connections  with  neighboring  GMS \ncountries is crucial for future development of the Lao PDR economy. However, the cost overrun \nhas  jeopardized  the  project,  increasing  the  risk of  delays  in  implementation.  There  is  a  strong \nneed  for  ADB  to  provide  supplementary  financial  assistance to  the  government  to  ensure  that \nthe project is completed on time and successfully. The project remains economically viable and \nfinancially sustainable with the supplementary financing. \n \nD. \n\nRevised Cost Estimate \n\n16. \nThe revised project cost is $118.6 million, including taxes and duties, and physical and \nprice  contingencies.  This  is  an  increase  of  34.0%  over  the  original  cost  estimate.  The  revised \nproject investment plan is in Table 3. The detailed cost estimates by expenditure category and \ntotal cost estimates by financier are in Appendix 4. \n\n                                                 \n5   ADB.  2005.

The  government  has  requested  ADB  to  provide  supplementary  grant  financing  of \n$27.0 million from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources. The government will provide supplementary \ncounterpart  financing  of  $3.1  million,  including  $1.67  million  in  taxes.  The  co-financiers  of  the \noriginal  project  (OPEC  Fund  for  International  Development  [OFID]  and  the  governments  of \nAustralia  and  the  Republic  of  Korea)  are  unable  to  provide  supplementary  financing  for  the \nproject.

MPWT  (formerly  the  Ministry  of  Communications,  Transport,  Posts,  and  Construction) \nwill continue to be the executing agency and will be responsible for the overall supervision and \nexecution  of  the  project.  DOR  is  the  implementing  agency  and  is  responsible  for  the  direct \nsupervision  and  execution  of  the  project.  The  Project  Management  Division  of  DOR,  which  is \nresponsible  for  managing  all  DOR  projects,  is  carrying  out  the  functions  of  a  project \nmanagement unit.  \n\n \n2. \n\nImplementation Period \n\nThe  proposed  supplementary \n\n20. \nimplementation period. The project will be completed by 31 December 2013. \n \n\nfinancing  will  not  require  any  extension  of \n\nthe \n\n3. \n\nProcurement \n\n21. \nProcurement  of  civil  works  for  sections  2\u20135  of  the  project  has  been  completed.  All \nprocurement financed by the ADB and the Government of Australia grants, and OFID loan, has \nbeen in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time).  \n\n22. \nProcurement of civil works for section 1, financed by the Government of the Republic of \nKorea,  including  the  new  Mekong  River  Bridge,  has  been  completed.  Procurement  of  the \nsupervision  consultant  for  section  1  has  also  been  completed.  The  procurement  followed \nGovernment of the Republic of Korea procedures. Detailed design was completed in May 2009. \nThe civil works procurement has been tendered, and the civil works contract was executed on \n31 August 2009. The civil works contractor is presently mobilizing its equipment and staff to the \nsite. The total value of the civil works contract did not exceed the amount estimated at appraisal.  \n\n23. \nProcurement  for  three  project  components  is  still  pending.  MPWT  has  completed  the \ninitial  selection  exercise  of  about  100  km  of  rural  access  roads  to  be  improved.  Design  of  the \nrural  roads  is  expected  to  begin  in  the  second  quarter  of  2010,  following  agreement  between \nMPWT and ADB on the selection of roads and scope of work. Selection of the roads on which \nperiodic  maintenance  is  to  be  carried  out  is  under  way.  The  maintenance  component  is \nexpected to be carried out during the second half of 2010. MPWT has drafted the detailed list of \nequipment  to  be  procured  for  the  Kenthao  border  crossing.  Procurement  and  installation  are \nexpected to take place during the second half of 2010. \n\n4. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n24. \nProcurement  of  the  supervision  consultants  for  sections  2\u20135  has  been  completed.  The \nsupervision  consultants  were  selected  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  The  supervision  consultants  have  been \nmobilized and will continue to function in accordance with their original terms of reference. The \nterms  of  reference  for  the  consulting  services  for  the  HIV/AIDS  awareness  and  prevention  of \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\n \n\nhuman trafficking program have been finalized, and the consultants are expected to be selected \nduring the second quarter of 2010. The consultants will be recruited using the quality- and cost-\nbased selection method and biodata technical proposal. The terms of reference for the external \nresettlement monitor assignment have also been finalized. A national consultant is expected to \nbe recruited as an individual consultant for the external resettlement monitor assignment during \nthe  second  quarter  of  2010.  The  recruitment  of  an  international  consultant  for  the  consulting \nservices for the road safety component is expected to take place during the second half of 2010. \nAll  consulting  services  will  be  recruited  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants and are financed by the Government of Australia.   \n\n5. \n\nAnticorruption Policy \n\n25. \nADB's Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance,  accountability  and \ntransparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged \ncorrupt,  fraudulent,  collusive,  or  coercive  practices  relating  to  the  project.  To  support  these \nefforts, relevant provisions of ADB's Anticorruption Policy are included in the grant regulations \nand  the  bidding  documents  for  the  project.  In  particular,  all  contracts  financed  by  ADB  in \nconnection  with  the  project  shall  include  provisions  specifying  the  right  of  ADB  to  audit  and \nexamine  the  records  and  accounts  of  MPWT  and  all  contractors,  suppliers,  consultants  and \nother service providers as they relate to the project. \n \n26. \nThe  project  incorporates  several  other  measures,  in  addition  to  the  standard  ADB \nrequirements,  to  deter  corruption  and  increase  transparency.  The  project  includes  (i)  building \nthe  capacity  of  MPWT  to  comply  with  ADB  and  government  procedures  as  outlined  in  the \nproject  administration  manual,  (ii)  establishment  of  a  project  website  to  disclose  information \nabout  project  implementation,  and  (iii)  establishment  of  a  grievance  redress  mechanism  to \nensure  greater  accountability.  The  project  website  provides  updated,  detailed  information  on \nproject  implementation.  For  example,  the  website  will  include  procurement-related  information \nsuch  as  the  list  of  participating  bidders,  name  of  the  winning  bidder,  basic  details  on  bidding \nprocedures  adopted,  amount  of  contract  awarded,  and  the  list  of  goods  and/or  services \nprocured. The grievance redress mechanism will receive and resolve complaints and act upon \nincluding  grievances \nstakeholders\u2019  reports  of \nconcerning  resettlement.  MPWT  is  publicizing  the  existence  of  this  mechanism  to  ensure  that \nstakeholders  are  aware  that  there  is  a  venue  to  address  concerns  or  grievances  relating  to \nfraud, corruption, abuse, and any other aspects of project implementation. Administration of the \nproject  will  be  delegated  to  the  Lao PDR  Resident  Mission  in  2010.  The  resident  mission\u2019s \nproximity  to  the  project  area  and  Lao  language  capabilities  will  facilitate  close  interaction  with \nMPWT  and \nthe  project  supervision  consultants,  as  well  close  monitoring  of  project \nimplementation. \n \n\nirregularities  on  project-related  matters, \n\n6. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\nThe  current  disbursement  arrangements  under \n\n27. \nthe  Northern  Greater  Mekong \nSubregional  Transport  Network  Improvement  Project  (footnote  4),  including  provisions  for  the \nimprest  account  and  statement  of  expenditures  procedures,  will  continue  to  apply  to  the \nsupplementary grant. \n \n\n7. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n28.  MPWT is maintaining separate accounts for the project, and will have such accounts and \nrelated financial statements audited annually by an external auditor in accordance with auditing \nstandards  acceptable  to  ADB.  MPWT  will  submit  to  ADB,  within  6  months  of  the  close  of  the \n\n \n\n\f \n\n9\n\n \n\n \n\nfiscal  year,  certified  copies  of  audited  project  accounts  and  financial  statements  and  auditor\u2019s \nreports,  all  in  English.  The  audit  of such  financial  statements  will  include  (i)  an  assessment  of \nthe  adequacy  of  accounting  and  internal  control  systems  with  respect  to  project  expenditures \nand other financial transactions, (ii) an assessment of compliance with financial grant covenants \nand ADB requirements for project management, (iii) an opinion on the use of the statement of \nexpenditures procedure, and (iv) an opinion on the use of the imprest account.  \n \n29.  MPWT  is  reporting  the  progress  of  project  implementation  by  submitting  quarterly \nprogress  reports  to  ADB  and  the  co-financiers.  MPWT  will  monitor  project  implementation  in \naccordance with the project implementation schedule, and will keep ADB and the co-financiers \ninformed of any significant deviations from the schedule. The quarterly reports include summary \ninformation  on  basic  data,  utilization  of  funds,  achievement  of  immediate  development \nobjectives, compliance with covenants, implementation progress, land acquisition, resettlement \nprogress, and major issues and problems. Within 3 months of the project\u2019s physical completion, \nMPWT will submit to ADB and the co-financiers a project completion report that will provide a \ndetailed  evaluation  of  the  project  design,  costs,  contractors\u2019  and  consultants\u2019  performance, \nsocial and economic impact, economic internal rate of return (EIRR), and such other details as \nmay be requested by ADB. \n \n\n8. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation  \n\n30.  A set of indicators for evaluating project performance in relation to its impacts, outcomes, \noutputs, and conditions has been agreed by MPWT and ADB. The baseline data include among \nothers  (i)  economic  development  and  socioeconomic  indicators,  (ii)  transport  costs  and  times, \n(iii)  transport  charges,  (iv)  accident  rates,  (v)  international  and  total  traffic  levels,  (vi) affected \npersons\u2019  incomes,  (vii)  access  to  social  services,  (viii)  jobs  created  in  construction  and \nmaintenance, (ix) incidence of STIs, and (x) incidence of human trafficking. The indicators will \nbe measured and compared with the baseline at project inception, completion, and after 3 years. \nindicators  are  disaggregated  by  gender  and  ethnicity.  The  project \nWhere  relevant, \nimplementation  consultants  will  help  train  MPWT  staff  in  using  the  monitoring  and  evaluation \nsystem.  The  main  sources  of  data  include  (i)  secondary  data  from  government  sources,  (ii)  a \nhousehold  socioeconomic  sample  survey,  and  (iii)  participatory  rapid  appraisal.  MPWT  will \nsubmit to ADB a report summarizing the key findings of monitoring at inception, completion, and \n3 years after physical completion of the project. \n \n\n9. \n\nProject Reviews \n\n31. \nADB,  the  government,  and  the  co-financiers  will  conduct  regular  annual  reviews  of  the \nproject,  and  will  jointly  undertake  a  midterm  review  of  the  project  in  mid-2011  to  assess \n(i) implementation status, (ii) design and construction standards, (iii) performance of consultants \nand  contractors,  (iv)  project  impacts,  (v)  status  of  compliance  with  the  covenants  stipulated  in \nthe  grant  agreement,  and  (vi)  the  need  for  any  changes  in  the  project  scope  or  schedule  to \nachieve the project impact. \n \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n\nA. \n\nTraffic Forecast  \n\nDuring preparation of the supplementary grant, new traffic counts were conducted at the \n32. \nsame  sites  along  the  project  road  that  were  used  during  preparation  of  the  original  project. \nSubstantial  changes  in  traffic  levels  and  composition  have  occurred  since  the  original  traffic \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\n \n\ncounts.  Actual  traffic  levels  are  higher  than  were  originally  forecast.  While  the  numbers  of \nmedium buses, light trucks, and motorcycles were lower than in the original forecast, there were \nsubstantial increases in the numbers of cars, medium trucks, and heavy trucks compared to the \nforecast. The numbers of four-wheel drive vehicles and light and heavy buses were also higher, \nalthough to a lesser extent. Traffic forecasts by vehicle type were prepared for the project road \nsections  for  2010\u20132032  (Appendix  7).  The  forecasts  are  based  on  expected  growth  in  GDP, \nincome elasticities of demand, and analysis of regional trade and tourism patterns. Total traffic \nexcluding  motorcycles  is  higher  than  the  original  project  forecast,  based  on  the  actual  traffic \nlevels  since  project  approval.  Total  traffic  including  motorcycles  is  forecast  to  grow  at  annual \nrates of about 4.8%\u20135.7% during 2010\u20132032, except during 2011\u20132015, when growth rates are \nhigher as a result of generated traffic. The projected growth rates are reasonable, considering \nexpected  economic  growth  in  the  project  area  and  experience  in  other  ADB-financed  road \nprojects.  Generated  traffic  arises  from  increased  shipments  of  agricultural  commodities  and \nother  goods,  and  increased  passenger  traffic  carrying  tourists  between  Thailand  and \nLouangphrabang. The improved road conditions will also generate demand by reducing vehicle \noperating costs (VOCs). \n \nB. \n\nEconomic Benefits \n\n33. \nThe  economic  analysis  has  been  revised  to  incorporate  updated  project  costs,  the \nrevised  traffic  forecast,  and  updated  values  of  benefits  (Appendix  7).  The  economic  analysis \nwas  carried  out  for  the  project  by  comparing  the  with-  and  without-project  scenarios.  In  the \nwithout-project scenario, the road is assumed to remain in its present condition. The with-project \nscenario  includes  routine  and  periodic  maintenance  according  to  international  standards.  The \nproject  preparatory  TA  (footnote  6)  considered  various  mutually  exclusive  project  alternatives \nsuch  as  different  pavement  types  and  alignments,  and  the  proposed  project  is  based  on  the \nmost cost-effective and least-cost option. Project economic costs include the resource costs of \nroad  improvement  and  maintenance,  equipment,  and  consulting  services.  The  primary \neconomic benefits for the project are VOC savings, time savings, diverted traffic, savings from \nimproved  road  safety,  and  savings  from  reduced  maintenance  costs.  Economic  benefits  were \ncalculated using the same methodology used for costs. VOC savings will accrue primarily from \nimprovements  in  the  road  surface,  horizontal  and  vertical  alignment,  and  increased  average \nspeed.  VOC  savings  for  normal  traffic  account  for  about  54%  of  total  benefits  while  benefits \nfrom generated traffic account for about 16%. Generated traffic is defined as new traffic induced \nfrom the reduction in transport costs arising from the project, and includes both international and \ndomestic generated traffic. Benefits for generated traffic are estimated at half the value of VOC \nsavings for normal traffic. The project will result in improved average speeds along the project \nroad, and the travel time for the entire length of the project road will be reduced from about 11 \nhours  to  about  6  hours.  Time  savings  account  for  about  19%  of  total  benefits.  Benefits  from \nimproved  road  safety  and  reduced  maintenance  costs  comprise  smaller  portions  of  total \nbenefits. The project will also have other benefits, such as improved access to social services. \nHowever, these have not been quantified because of lack of sufficient data. \n \n34. \nThe  EIRR  for  the  project  is  19.4%,  and  the  net  present  value  is  $40.7  million,  using  a \n12% discount rate. The EIRR and net present value have increased from those for the original \nproject (EIRR of 16.6% and net present value of $22.3 million) primarily because of the change \nin  composition  of  traffic  and  increased  traffic  forecast.  In  particular,  the  numbers  of  heavy \nvehicles,  especially  medium  and  heavy  trucks,  and  cars,  in  the  revised  traffic  forecast  are \nsignificantly  higher  than  in  the  original  traffic  forecast,  in  accordance  with  actual  traffic  levels \nsince approval. Since these heavy vehicles have high operating costs, they generate large VOC \nsavings  with  the  improved  road,  providing  substantial  economic  benefits.  These  additional \n\n \n\n\f \n\n11\n\n \n\n \n\nbenefits  exceed  the  negative  impact  on  the  economic  return  of  the  increased  project  costs. \nWhile total traffic is lower in the revised forecast, this is because the number of motorcycles is \nmuch  lower  than  in  the  original  forecast.  Since  motorcycles  have  very  low  VOCs  relative  to \nother  vehicle  types,  reduction  in  their  numbers  has  only  a  small  effect  on  the  level  of  project \nbenefits.  \n \n35. \nSensitivity  analysis  was  carried  out  to  test  the  effects  of  negative  changes  in  the  key \nparameters that determine the benefits and costs of the project. The sensitivity analysis for the \nproject indicates that capital costs would have to increase by 51% or total benefits decrease by \n39% for the EIRR to reach the level of 12%. Given ADB\u2019s experience with similar projects in the \nLao PDR and the completion of detailed design work, such changes are not expected to occur. \nThe sensitivity analysis shows that the EIRR exceeds 12% in all cases. A distribution analysis \nwas  carried  out.  Project  benefits  accruing  to  the  Lao  PDR  are  distributed  among  five  groups: \n(i) users of freight transport, (ii) users of passenger transport, (iii) vehicle owners, (iv) labor, and \n(v)  the  government  and/or  economy  of  the  Lao  PDR.  Users  of  passenger  transport  receive \nabout 29% of total benefits, users of freight transport receive about 24%, vehicle owners receive \nabout 14%, and the government and/or the economy receives about 31%.  \n \nC. \n\nResettlement \n\n The  project  is  rated  category  B,  and  a  short  resettlement  plan  was  prepared  for  the \n36. \nwhole  length  of  Route  4  and  the  Mekong  River  Bridge  as  part  of  the  original  grant.  The \nresettlement plan is divided into five sections and it is currently being updated following detailed \ndesign.  It  is  expected  that  road  widening  may  increase  the  number  of  households  but  the \nimpacts will not be significant. Specific to section 5, the draft updated resettlement plan shows \nthat  the  number  of  households  increased  from  57  to  805,  but  only  seven  households  will  be \nrequired to relocate. Impacts on agricultural land are marginal and no household will lose 10% \nor more of its productive assets. Therefore, the project is still rated category B.  \n \nD. \n\nSocial Impact and Gender \n\n37. \nThe project will provide direct social benefits in addition to the economic benefits, which \nwill  expand  economic  opportunities  available  to  the  poor.  The  project  road  passes  through \nlargely agricultural areas that are in transition from production for subsistence consumption and \nfor local markets to more export and commercially oriented crops. Rural women in the project \ndistricts are engaged in both subsistence and commercial agriculture. Upgrading of the project \nroad  will  provide  a  strategic  all-weather  link  that  will  facilitate  improved  access  for  men  and \nwomen  to  goods,  markets,  schools,  medical  facilities,  and other  social  services  for  the  project \ndistricts.  The  improved  road  access  will  lower  the  costs  for  the  public  sector  to  provide  social \nservices.  The  project  will  have  a  positive  health  impact  on  people  from  about  120  villages \nlocated  along  the  road,  by  improving  the  very  dusty  and  hazardous  road  conditions  in  which \nchildren walk several kilometers to school during the dry season. Increased access to transport \nin  the  project  districts  will  increase  enrollment  of  children  from  rural  areas  in  the  secondary \nschools  in  towns.  Construction  and  operation  of  the  road  will  provide  significant  employment \nopportunities  for  poor  people.  Poor  men  and  women  will  also  benefit  through  seasonal \nemployment  from  road  maintenance  work.  Increased  tourism  will  generate  additional  demand \nfor locally produced goods and services. Improvement of rural access roads will help to extend \nthe project benefits and opportunities to rural communities.  \n \n38. \nPotential adverse social and gender impacts from the project, in addition to the project\u2019s \nresettlement impacts, include (i) increased traffic safety risks for people living and working along \n\n \n\n\f12 \n\n \n\n \n\nthe road caused by higher traffic levels and higher vehicle speeds along the improved road; and \n(ii) increased risks of exposure to HIV/AIDS and human trafficking of women and children during \nconstruction and operation because of the influx of construction workers and increased transit \ntraffic.  The  project  will  address  these  risks  through  the  road  safety  component  and  HIV/AIDS \nand human trafficking program. \n \nE. \n\nIndigenous Peoples \n\nIn the project area, 82.3% of the population is classified Lao-Tai (the main ethnic group); \n39. \n10.8%  Mon-Khmer;  5.8%  Hmong-Mien;  and  0.3%  Chinese-Tibetan.  The  indigenous  peoples \ngroups have been relocated to the project area since 1970 because of the Indochina war and as \npart  of  government  relocation  efforts.  The  groups  now  practice  sedentary  agriculture  and  rice \nfarming, and have been involved in commercialization of agriculture. Although they retain their \ntraditional  culture,  religion,  and  social  organization,  they  have  adopted  mainstream  language, \neducation,  and  agricultural  practices.  The  literacy  rate  among  the  Mon-Khmer  is  close  to  the \nnational average, but the Hmong-Mien have a literacy rate about half the national average. The \nvillage  consultation  indicates  that  indigenous  peoples  groups  support  the  road  improvement. \nThe Khmou live along the project road and account for 40% of the 255 households potentially \naffected by resettlement. The impact on their agricultural land is minor. These groups will benefit \nfrom the economic development arising from the project, including improved access to markets \nand social services and greater opportunities for their roadside small businesses. The project is \nrated  category  B.  Specific  actions  are  already  included  in  the  resettlement  plan  and  the \nHIV/AIDS  and  human  trafficking  prevention  program  to  ensure  that  they  are  not  marginalized \nand  become  vulnerable  by  resettlement  activities  and  changes  brought  by  upgrading  of  the \nproject road. \n \nF. \n\nEnvironmental Assessment \n\nThe  project  classification \n\nis  environment  category  B.  An \n\ninitial  environmental \n40. \nexamination (IEE) for the supplementary grant was carried out and reviewed by ADB. The IEE \nconcluded  that  the  project  will  not  have  any  major  adverse  environmental  impacts  and  only \nshort-term air and water pollution, noise, traffic disturbance, and soil erosion impacts during the \nconstruction period. The mitigation measures identified in the IEE\u2019s environmental management \nplan  include  (i)  restoration  of  affected  areas,  e.g.,  borrow  pits,  after  project  completion;  (ii) \nimplementation  of  slope  stabilization  measures;  (iii)  controlling  sewage  discharge  and  other \nwaste fluids from construction sites, and hazardous and toxic materials from bitumen plants and \nfrom  construction  equipment;  (iv)  maintaining  proper  drainage  to  avoid  stagnation  and \ncontrolling  downstream  water  pollution;  (v)  topsoil  removal  and  reinstallation  for  re-vegetation \nupon completion of road improvement works; (vi) minimizing noise, dust, emissions, and other \npollutants  associated  with  civil  works;  and  (vii)  provision  of  adequate  road  access  during \nconstruction. The project will eliminate heavy road dust emissions, thereby reducing safety risks \ncaused by extremely poor road visibility under current road conditions. The road improvement \nwill also reduce associated health risks to roadside communities. The project will have overall \nbeneficial  environmental  impacts  and  will  have  minor  negative  impacts,  which  will be  carefully \nmonitored and adequately mitigated.  \n \nG. \n\nRisks \n\nThe  major  risks  identified  for  the  original  grant  also  apply  to  the  supplementary  grant. \n41. \nThe  project  is  formulated  to  minimize  potential  risks  during  and  after  project  implementation. \nThe  traffic  forecast  may  not  materialize,  but  the  project  remains  viable  even  with  substantially \n\n \n\n\f \n\n13\n\n \n\n \n\nlower traffic levels. There is a risk that the road may not be properly maintained, but this will be \naddressed by the emphasis of ADB and other international institutions, and the commitment of \nthe  government  to  road  maintenance.  Compensation,  assistance,  and  income  restoration \nmeasures relating to involuntary resettlement might not be delivered on time, thereby delaying \nthe  start  of  civil  works.  The  gender  strategy  includes  consultation  workshops  for  the  affected \nhouseholds  to  increase  their  understanding  of  resettlement  issues  such  as  entitlements, \ncompensation,  and  the  grievance  process.  Upgrading  of  the  road  will  increase  the  mobility  of \ngoods and people along the route and could increase risks of HIV/AIDS and human trafficking in \nlocal  communities,  especially  among  women  and  children.  To  minimize  the  potential  risks  of \nincreased  road  traffic  accidents,  HIV/AIDS,  and  human  trafficking,  the  project  includes  a  road \nsafety program and an HIV/AIDS and human trafficking mitigation and awareness program.  \n \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n42. \nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  government  has  assured  its  continued \ncompliance with the covenants set forth in the  Grant Agreement dated  26 November 2007. In \nparticular, the government will ensure that the widening of section 5 complies with all covenants \nrelating  to  implementation  of  the  updated  resettlement  plan  and  environmental  and  social \nsafeguards.   \n \n\nVI. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n43. \n I am satisfied that the proposed supplementary grant would comply with the Articles of \nAgreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve the \ngrant  not  exceeding  the  equivalent  of  $27,000,000  to  the  Lao  People\u2019s  Democratic  Republic \nfrom  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources,  for  the  Northern  Greater  Mekong  Subregion  Transport \nNetwork  Improvement  Project,  on  terms  and  conditions substantially  in  accordance  with  those \nset forth in the draft grant agreement presented to the Board. \n\n \n\n \n\nDate: 29 March 2010 \n\n \n \n \nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n \n\n \n\n\f14 \n\n \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n \n\n \n\nDesign \nSummary \nImpact \nTrade in the region and \neconomic growth in the \nproject area increase \n\nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n\nPerformance Targets \nand Indicators \n\nData Sources and \nReporting Mechanisms  \n\nAssumptions  \nand Risks  \n\n \n1.

Other  multilateral  donors  finance  smaller  projects  or \nprovide cofinancing for ADB or World Bank projects. Several other bilateral donors provide assistance \nas well. ADB, Japan, and other bilateral donors provide substantial assistance for projects addressing \nregional  cooperation  and  integration.  ADB  assistance  in  this  area  is  provided  through  Greater \nMekong  Subregion  transport  corridor  projects.  Japan  and  other  bilateral  donors  have  provided \ncofinancing for these projects. Japan, Australia, and Thailand have also financed bridges connecting \nthe  Lao  PDR  with  its  neighbors.

The Ministry of Public Works and Transport arranges joint project review missions and \nstrategy  discussions  twice  per  year,  in  which  the  World  Bank,  Sida,  and  ADB  regularly \nparticipate;  and  at  times  other  donors.  Frequent  informal  communications  are  maintained \namong the donors. The World Bank and ADB cooperate closely in formulation of projects. For \nexample,  while  the  World  Bank  has  taken  the  lead  in  addressing  road  maintenance,  ADB \nprojects  have  included  components  for  road  maintenance,  which  are  designed  to  follow  Road \nMaintenance  Fund  procedures  established  with  World  Bank  assistance.  ADB  coordinates \nclosely with bilateral and other multilateral donors. Financing for the Northern Greater Mekong \nSubregion  Transport  Network  Improvement  Project  includes  cofinancing  from  Australia,  the \nRepublic of Korea, and the OPEC Fund for International Development. Previous ADB projects \nhave  included  cofinancing  from  Sida,  the  Nordic  Development  Fund,  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of \nChina, and Thailand. \n \n\n \n\n\f20 \n\n \n\nAppendix 3 \n\nPRICE CHANGES: JULY 2007 (TIME OF APPRAISAL) COMPARED WITH 2008 AND 2009 \n\nJuly 2007 \nPreliminary \nDesign Basis \nUsed at \nAppraisal \n\nJuly 2008 \nMedian Unit \nPrice as Bid \nby Civil Works \nContractors \n\nPercentage \nIncrease \nJuly 2007 to \nJuly 2008 \n\nOctober 2009 \nFact-Finding for \nSupplementary \nGrant \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nPercentage \nIncrease \nJuly 2007 to \nOctober \n2009 \n\n \n\nItem \nMaterial costs ($) \n\nBitumen (liter) \nAggregate subbase, \ntype a (m3) \nAggregate base, type \nb (m3) \nDiesel Fuel (liter) \nReinforcing Steel (ton) \nCement (ton) \n\n$0.67  \n$6.50  \n\n$0.93  \n$14.80  \n\n$22.00  \n\n$23.64  \n\n$0.85  \n$750.00  \n$76.20  \n$0.92  \n\n$1.44  \n$1,240.00  \n$84.82  \n$0.92  \n\n38.8 \n127.7 \n\n7.5 \n\n69.4 \n65.3 \n11.3 \n0.0 \n\n$1.01 \n$7.00 \n\n$23.00 \n\n$0.83 \n$657.00 \n$86.14 \n$1.81  \n\nUnskilled labor costs  \n    (person-hour) \nAppreciation of the kip    \n    against the US dollar \nAverage annual   \n    inflation (%)a \n( ) = negative, \u2026 = not available, m3 = cubic meter.  \na  As measured by the consumer price index (%). \nSources: Department of Roads of the Ministry of Public Works and Transport, and the Asian Development Bank. \n\n$1 = 9,617 \n\n$1 = 8,606 \n\n$1 = 8,450 \n\n0.7% \n\n4.5% \n\n7.6% \n\n10.5 \n\n\u2026 \n\n50.7 \n7.7 \n\n4.5 \n\n(2.4) \n(12.4) \n13.0 \n96.7 \n\n12.1 \n\n\u2026 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 4 \n\n \n\n21\n\nREVISED DETAILED PROJECT COST ESTIMATES (2007 versus 2009) \n \nTable A4: Road 4, Sections 2\u20135a \n \n\n \n \nAugust 2007 \nAppraisal \n\n \n \nJuly 2008 \nAwarded Bids \n\nOctober 2009 \nCompletion \nDetailed \nEngineering \n\n \nDifference between Appraisal \nand Completion of  \nDetailed Design \n\nLength \n(km) \n82.58 \n\nCost \n($million) \n6.93  \n\nLength \n(km) \n82.58 \n\nCost \n($ million) \n\n9.90       \n\nLength \n(km) \n82.20 \n\nCost \n($ million) \n21.70  \n\nLength \n(km) \n(0.38) \n\nCostb \n($ million) \n14.77  \n\n% \n213.00 \n\nRoad Section \n5  Hoauy Pet\u2013\nKenthao\u2013\nBotene\u2013Nakha \n \n\n4  Paklay\u2013Houay \n\nPet \n \n\n2  Xaignabouli via \nThadeua\u2013Nam \nPui \n \n\n45.62 \n\n4.98  \n\n45.62 \n\n7.62       \n\n45.52 \n\n9.94  \n\n(0.10) \n\n4.96  \n\n100.00 \n\n3  Nam Pui\u2013Paklay \n\n99.93 \n\n12.59  \n\n99.93 \n\n14.58       \n\n99.40 \n\n18.05  \n\n(0.53) \n\n5.46  \n\n43.00 \n\n79.94 \n\n12.69  \n\n79.94 \n\n15.32       \n\n79.75 \n\n17.71 \n\n(0.19) \n\n5.02 \n\n40.00 \n \n\nTotal \n\n308.07 \n\n37.19  \n\n308.07 \n\n47.42        306.87 \n\n67.40 \n\n(1.20) \n\n30.21 \n\n81.00 \n\n( ) = negative, km = kilometer. \na  Includes taxes and contingencies. \nb Reflects reduction in shoulder widths from 1.0 meter (m) to 0.5 m on all sections; and widening of embankment to 8 m on section 5, \nwith 7.0 m pavement width. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n\n \n\n\f22 \n\n \n\nAppendix 5 \n\nREVISED COST ESTIMATES BY EXPENDITURE CATEGORY AND FINANCIER \n \nTable A5.1: Revised Cost Estimates by Expenditure Category \n($ million) \n\nItem \nA. \n\nInvestment Cost \n\nBasea \n\n \n\n \n\nSupp \n\nTotal \n\n% \n\n \n\n \n\n  1.

Actual  traffic  levels  are  higher  than  originally  forecast.  While  the  numbers  of  medium \nbuses,  light  trucks,  and  motorcycles  were  lower  than  in  the  original  forecast,  there  were \nsubstantial increases in the numbers of cars, medium trucks, and heavy trucks compared to the \nforecast. The numbers of four-wheel drive vehicles and light and heavy buses were also higher, \nalthough to a lesser extent. Traffic forecasts by vehicle type were prepared for the project road \nsections  for  2010\u20132032.  The  forecasts  are  based  on  expected  growth  in  gross  domestic \nproduct,  income  elasticities  of  demand,  and  analysis  of  regional  trade  and  tourism  patterns. \nTotal  traffic  excluding  motorcycles  is  higher  than  the  original  project  forecast,  based  on  the \nactual traffic levels since project approval. Total traffic including motorcycles is forecast to grow \nat annual rates of about 4.8%\u20135.7% during 2010\u20132032, except during 2011\u20132015, when growth \nrates  are  higher  as  a  result  of  generated  traffic  developing.  The  projected  growth  rates  are \nreasonable considering expected economic growth in the project area and experience in other \nroad projects financed by the Asian Development Bank. Generated traffic arises from increased \nshipments  of  agricultural  commodities  and  other  goods,  and  increased  passenger  traffic \ncarrying tourists between Thailand and Louangphrabang. The improved road conditions will also \ngenerate  demand  by  reducing  vehicle  operating  costs  (VOCs).

The economic analysis was carried out \nfor  the  project  by  comparing  the  with-  and  without-project  scenarios.  In  the  without-project \nscenario,  the  road  is  assumed  to  remain  in  its  present  condition.  The  with-project  scenario \nincludes  routine  and  periodic  maintenance  according  to  international  standards.  The  project \npreparatory  technical  assistance  considered  various  mutually  exclusive  project  alternatives, \nsuch  as  different  pavement  types  and  alignments,  and  the  proposed  project  is  based  on  the \nmost cost-effective and least-cost option. The economic analysis covers 25 years (2008\u20132032), \nbased on a 6-year implementation period. The economic prices are expressed using the world \nprice numeraire. \n \nC. \n\nCosts \n\nProject  economic  costs \n\nthe  resource  costs  of  road \n\nimprovement  and \n3. \ninclude \nmaintenance,  equipment,  and  consulting  services.  Price  contingencies, \ninterest  during \nconstruction,  and  taxes  and  duties  are  excluded.  Costs  were  divided  into  tradable  and  non-\ntradable portions. A standard conversion factor of 0.9 was applied to the non-tradable portion. \nTo take into account local unemployment and underemployment, costs for unskilled labor were \nadjusted by a shadow wage rate factor of 0.9 to arrive at the economic opportunity cost. \n \nD. \n\nBenefits \n\n4. \nThe primary economic benefits for the project are VOC savings from normal, generated, \nand diverted traffic; time savings; savings from improved road safety; and savings from reduced \nmaintenance  costs.  Economic  benefits  were  calculated  using  the  same  methodology  used  for \ncosts.  VOCs  were  recalculated  using  2009  prices.  VOC  savings  will  accrue  primarily  from \nimprovements in the road surface, and horizontal and vertical alignment. Unit economic VOCs \nfor  nine  types  of  vehicles  were  estimated  using  the  Highway  Design  and  Maintenance \nStandards  Model-IV  and  representative  VOCs  are  shown  in  Table  A7.4.  VOC  savings  for \nnormal  traffic  account  for  about  54%  of  total  benefits  while  benefits  from  generated  traffic \naccount for about 16%. Generated traffic is defined as new traffic induced from the reduction in \ntransport costs arising from the project, and includes both international and domestic generated \ntraffic. Benefits for generated traffic are estimated at half the value of VOC savings for normal \ntraffic. Benefits from diverted traffic arise from the diversion of traffic from other roads in the Lao \n\n \n\n\f30 \n\n \n\nAppendix 7 \n\nPeople\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR), particularly Route 13 from Vientiane to the northern \nLao PDR. \n \n\nTable A7.4 Representative Vehicle Operating Costs by Vehicle Type \n($ per vehicle-km) \n\nVOC Savings \n\nWithout Projecta  With Projectb \n\n \n0.042 \n0.112 \n0.042 \n0.049 \n0.159 \n0.247 \n\n \n0.233 \n0.317 \n0.223 \n0.219 \n0.511 \n0.846 \n\n \n0.191 \n0.205 \n0.181 \n0.170 \n0.352 \n0.599 \n\nVehicle Type \nRolling terrain \nCar \nFour-wheel drive \nLight bus  \nLight truck  \nMedium truck \nHeavy truck \nkm = kilometer, VOC = vehicle operating cost. \na  Corresponding to an international roughness index of 10 for a gravel road. \nb   Corresponding to an international roughness index of 2. \nSource:  Consultants estimates. \n \n5. \nTime savings account for about 19% of total benefits, and include savings in passenger \nand freight time. The project will result in improved average speeds along the project road, e.g., \nfrom 56.1 kilometers per hour (km/hour) to 82.8 km/hour for a car. The travel time for the entire \nlength  of  the  project  road  will  be  reduced  from  about  11  hours  to  6  hours.  The  value  of  time \nsaved by passengers traveling during work time was calculated at $0.28 per hour, based on an \nestimate of passengers\u2019 average annual income. This value was also used for people traveling \nduring  leisure  time  since  no  data  on  people\u2019s  willingness  to  pay  for  travel  time  savings  in  the \nLao PDR was available. The value of time saved for freight is assumed at $1.58/vehicle-hour for \nlight  trucks,  $7.09/vehicle-hour  for  medium  trucks,  $9.45/vehicle-hour  for  heavy  trucks,  and \n$0.24/vehicle-hour for motorcycles and motorized tricycles. Benefits from improved road safety \nand  reduced  maintenance  costs  comprise  smaller  portions  of  total  benefits.  Savings  in  road \nmaintenance  costs  are  based  on  the  routine  maintenance  necessary  to  maintain  an \ninternational roughness index of 10, including grading of the current earth surface of the road. \nSavings  from  improved  road  safety  arise  from  the  reduced  number  of  accidents  per  vehicle-\nkilometer  on  the  improved  road,  and  in  the  severity  of  accidents.  The  cost  per  accident  was \nestimated at $1,165, based on government statistics. The project will also have other benefits, \nsuch as improved access to social services, but these have not been quantified because of the \nlack of sufficient data. \n \nE. \n\nResults of Economic Analysis \n\n6. \nThe economic internal rate of return (EIRR) was recalculated for the project. The EIRR \nfor the project is 19.4%, and the net present value is $40.7 million, using a 12% discount rate \n(Table A7.5). The EIRR and net present value have increased from those for the original project \n(EIRR  of  16.6%  and  net  present  value  of  $22.3  million)  primarily  because  of  the  change  in \ncomposition  of  traffic  and  the  increased  traffic  forecast.  In  particular,  the  numbers  of  heavy \nvehicles,  especially  medium  and  heavy  trucks,  cars,  and  light  buses,  in  the  revised  traffic \nforecast  are  significantly  higher  than  in  the  original  traffic  forecast,  in  accordance  with  actual \ntraffic  levels  since  approval.  Since  these  heavy  vehicles  have  high  operating  costs,  they \ngenerate  large  VOC  savings  with  the  improved  road,  providing  substantial  economic  benefits. \nThese additional benefits exceed the negative impact on the economic return of the increased \nproject  costs.  While  total  traffic  is  lower  in  the revised  forecast,  this  is because  the  number  of \nmotorcycles is much lower than in the original forecast. Since motorcycles have very low VOCs \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 7 \n\n31\n\nrelative  to  other  vehicle  types,  their  reduction  has  only  a  small  effect  on  the  level  of  project \nbenefits. \n\n \nTable A7.5: Economic Internal Rate of Return \n($ million) \n\n \n\n \n\nCapital \nCosts \n\n \n\n \nMaint \nCosts \n\nTotal \nCosts \n\n----------------------------------------------Benefits-------------------------------------------- \nNormal \nTraffic \n\nGenerated \nTraffic \n\nDiverted \nTraffic \n\nTotal \nBenefits \n\nMaint \nSavings \n\nTime \nSavings \n\nRoad \nSafety \n\nNet \nBenefits \n\nYear \n\n2008 \n\n2009 \n\n2010 \n\n2011 \n\n2012 \n\n2013 \n\n2014 \n\n2015 \n\n2016 \n\n2017 \n\n2018 \n\n2019 \n\n2020 \n\n2021 \n\n2022 \n\n2023 \n\n2024 \n\n2025 \n\n2026 \n\n2027 \n\n2028 \n\n2029 \n\n2030 \n\n2031 \n\n24.171 \n\n0.000  24.171 \n\n10.144 \n\n0.479 \n\n0.000 \n\n0.479 \n\n13.377 \n\n0.000  13.377 \n\n17.908 \n\n0.000  17.908 \n\n21.704 \n\n0.000  21.704 \n\n20.235 \n\n0.000  20.235 \n\n0.000 \n\n0.000 \n\n0.000 \n\n0.000 \n\n0.000 \n\n0.000 \n\n0.000 \n\n0.000 \n\n0.000 \n\n0.000 \n\n0.000 \n\n0.000 \n\n0.000 \n\n0.000 \n\n0.000 \n\n0.000 \n\n0.000 \n\n0.000 \n\n2.169 \n\n2.169 \n\n2.169 \n\n2.169 \n\n2.169 \n\n2.169 \n\n2.169 \n\n2.169 \n\n7.540 \n\n7.540 \n\n2.169 \n\n2.169 \n\n2.169 \n\n2.169 \n\n2.169 \n\n2.169 \n\n2.169 \n\n2.169 \n\n2.169 \n\n2.169 \n\n7.540 \n\n7.540 \n\n2.169 \n\n2.169 \n\n2.169 \n\n2.169 \n\n2.169 \n\n2.169 \n\n2.169 \n\n2.169 \n\n2.169 \n\n2.169 \n\n7.540 \n\n7.540 \n\n2.169 \n\n2.169 \n\n0.000 \n\n0.000 \n\n0.000 \n\n0.000 \n\n5.487 \n\n11.581 \n\n11.906 \n\n12.247 \n\n12.603 \n\n12.953 \n\n13.317 \n\n13.697 \n\n14.093 \n\n14.506 \n\n14.936 \n\n15.386 \n\n15.855 \n\n16.345 \n\n16.857 \n\n17.385 \n\n17.930 \n\n18.492 \n\n19.071 \n\n0.000 \n\n0.000 \n\n0.000 \n\n0.000 \n\n0.650 \n\n1.828 \n\n2.832 \n\n3.720 \n\n3.863 \n\n4.016 \n\n4.171 \n\n4.335 \n\n4.509 \n\n4.694 \n\n4.891 \n\n5.100 \n\n5.322 \n\n5.559 \n\n5.810 \n\n6.079 \n\n6.359 \n\n6.652 \n\n6.959 \n\n7.280 \n\n7.616 \n\n0.000 \n\n0.000 \n\n0.000 \n\n0.000 \n\n1.576 \n\n3.082 \n\n3.721 \n\n4.046 \n\n4.186 \n\n4.333 \n\n4.481 \n\n4.635 \n\n4.798 \n\n4.968 \n\n5.148 \n\n5.337 \n\n5.535 \n\n5.745 \n\n5.965 \n\n6.197 \n\n6.438 \n\n6.689 \n\n6.949 \n\n7.220 \n\n7.501 \n\n0.000 \n\n0.000 \n\n0.000 \n\n0.000 \n\n0.255 \n\n0.465 \n\n0.525 \n\n0.533 \n\n0.542 \n\n0.551 \n\n0.565 \n\n0.580 \n\n0.595 \n\n0.611 \n\n0.627 \n\n0.644 \n\n0.661 \n\n0.678 \n\n0.697 \n\n0.715 \n\n0.735 \n\n0.755 \n\n0.775 \n\n0.796 \n\n0.818 \n\n0.000 \n\n0.000 \n\n0.000 \n\n0.000 \n\n0.004 \n\n0.008 \n\n0.009 \n\n0.009 \n\n0.010 \n\n0.010 \n\n0.011 \n\n0.011 \n\n0.012 \n\n0.012 \n\n0.013 \n\n0.013 \n\n0.014 \n\n0.015 \n\n0.016 \n\n0.016 \n\n0.017 \n\n0.018 \n\n0.019 \n\n0.020 \n\n0.021 \n\n0.000 \n\n0.000 \n\n0.000 \n\n0.000 \n\n0.000 \n\n2.230 \n\n2.230 \n\n2.230 \n\n2.230 \n\n2.230 \n\n2.230 \n\n2.230 \n\n2.230 \n\n2.230 \n\n2.230 \n\n2.230 \n\n2.230 \n\n2.230 \n\n2.230 \n\n2.230 \n\n2.230 \n\n2.230 \n\n2.230 \n\n2.230 \n\n2.230 \n\n0.000 \n\n(0.479) \n\n0.000 \n\n(13.377) \n\n0.000 \n\n(17.908) \n\n0.000 \n\n(21.704) \n\n7.971 \n\n(12.264) \n\n17.757 \n\n(6.414) \n\n20.898 \n\n18.729 \n\n22.445 \n\n20.277 \n\n23.078 \n\n20.909 \n\n23.744 \n\n21.575 \n\n24.411 \n\n16.870 \n\n25.109 \n\n22.940 \n\n25.841 \n\n23.672 \n\n26.609 \n\n24.440 \n\n27.415 \n\n25.246 \n\n28.260 \n\n26.092 \n\n29.149 \n\n21.608 \n\n30.082 \n\n27.913 \n\n31.063 \n\n28.894 \n\n32.095 \n\n29.926 \n\n33.165 \n\n30.996 \n\n34.275 \n\n32.106 \n\n35.425 \n\n27.885 \n\n36.618 \n\n34.449 \n\n37.855 \n\n72.537 \n\nEIRR = \n\n19.43% \n\nNPV = \n\n40.692 \n \n\n2032 \n\n(36.851) \n\n2.169 \n\n(34.682) \n\n19.669 \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n(  ) = negative, EIRR = economic internal rate of return, Maint = maintenance, NPV = net present value. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n \n\nF. \n\nSensitivity Analysis \n\n7. \nSensitivity  analysis  was  carried  out  to  test  the  effects  of  negative  changes  in  the  key \nparameters that determine the benefits and costs and to test that the detailed design has been \ncompleted  and  the  contracts  of  the  project  awarded.  The  sensitivity  analysis,  shown  in \nTable A7.6,  indicates  that  capital  costs  would  have  to  increase  by  51%  or  total  benefits \ndecrease by 39% for the EIRR to reach the level of 12%. Given the Asian Development Bank's \nexperience with similar projects in the Lao PDR, such changes are not expected to occur. The \nsensitivity  analysis  shows  that  the  EIRR  exceeds  the  level  of  12%  in  all  cases.  Even  if  there \nwere  no  generated  traffic,  the  EIRR  remains  above  12%.  To  determine  the  degree  of \nuncertainty of the project, a risk analysis was carried out. Key variables, e.g., costs and traffic \n\n \n\n\f32 \n\n \n\nAppendix 7 \n\ngrowth rates, were assigned a random value within defined limits based on assumed probability \ndistribution  functions.  A  Latin  Hypercube  type  random  sampling  was  used,  and  the  simulation \nrun was made with 500 iterations to generate the probability distribution of the EIRR.

The  project  benefits  are  distributed  among  five  national  groups:  (i)  users  of \npassenger  transport,  (ii)  users  of  freight  transport,  (iii)  vehicle  owners,  (iv)  labor,  and  (v)  the \ngovernment and economy of the Lao PDR. Users of passenger transport receive about 29% of \ntotal benefits, users of freight transport receive about 24%, vehicle owners receive about 14%, \nand the economy receives about 31%. \n \n\nTable A7.7: Distribution of Net Benefits \n\nFinancial \nPV \n \n\nEconomic \nPV \n \n\nItem \n\nBenefits \n\nNormal Traffic \nGenerated \nTime \nDiverted \nSafety \nMaintenance \n\nCosts \n\nInvestment and  \n   maintenance \nLabor \n\nNPV \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  (70.75) \n\n  (12.49) \n(83.24) \n\n59.84 \n18.18 \n20.55 \n2.63 \n0.05 \n9.45 \n \n(59.51) \n\n(10.50) \n40.69  \n\n($ million) \n\nEconomic - \nFinancial \n\nPassenger \nUsers \n\n \n59.84 \n18.18 \n20.55 \n2.63 \n0.05 \n9.45 \n \n11.25 \n\n \n\n23.94 \n \n10.27 \n1.31 \n0.03 \n \n \n \n\nFreight \nUsers \n \n23.94 \n \n5.14 \n0.66 \n \n \n \n \n\nVehicle \nOwners  Labor  Economy \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n11.97 \n \n5.14 \n0.66 \n0.03 \n \n \n \n\n  \n  \n18.18 \n  \n  \n  \n9.45 \n  \n11.25 \n\nNet \nBenefits \n \n59.84  \n18.18  \n20.55  \n2.63  \n0.05  \n9.45  \n\n \n11.25  \n\n1.98 \n123.93  \n\n \n35.55  \n\n \n29.73 \n\n \n17.79  \n\n1.98 \n1.98  \n\n \n38.88  \n\n1.98  \n123.93  \n\n( ) = negative number, NPV = net present value, PV = present value. \nSources: Asian Development Bank and technical assistance consultants estimates. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f", "author_pages": [" \n", " \n", " \n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n", " \n", " \n", "CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 22 March 2010) \n", "Currency Unit \n", "kip (KN) \n", "\u2013 \n", "= \n= \n", "KN1.00 \n$1.00 \n", "$0.000118 \nKN8,475.50 \n", " \n \n", " \n \n", "ADB  \nDOR \nEIRR \nGDP \nGMS \nICB \nIEE \nkm \nLao PDR \nm \nMPWT \nNCB \nOFID \nPRC \nSTI  \nTA  \nVOC \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "ABBREVIATIONS \n", "Asian Development Bank \nDepartment of Roads \neconomic internal rate of return \ngross domestic product \nGreater Mekong Subregion \ninternational competitive bidding \ninitial environmental examination \nkilometer \nLao People\u2019s Democratic Republic \nmeter \nMinistry of Public Works and Transport \nnational competitive bidding \nOPEC Fund for International Development \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China \nsexually transmitted infection \ntechnical assistance \nvehicle operating cost \n", "NOTES \n", "(i) \n", "The fiscal year (FY) of the government and its agencies ends on 30 September. \nFY  before  a  calendar  year  denotes  the  year  in  which  the  fiscal  year  ends, \ne.g., FY 2010 ends on 30 September 2010.  \n", "(ii) \n", "In this report, \u201c$\u201d refers to US dollars. \n", " \nVice-President \nDirector General \nDirector \n \nTeam leader \nTeam members \n \n \n \n \n \n", "C.
