The Solomon Islands economy is experiencing a significant contraction as a result of \nthe COVID-19 pandemic, and this is beginning to feed through to lower government revenues. \nWithout  action,  a  continuing  contraction  in  government  revenues,  coupled  with  increases  in \ngovernment expenditure, particularly for public health preparedness and response, will develop \ninto a fiscal crisis.  \n \n3. \nSolomon  Islands,  a  small  island  developing  state,  is  among  those  classified  as \nexperiencing fragile and conflict-affected situations. The government, the private sector, and the \ncommunity are not well equipped to deal with the wide-ranging implications of COVID-19. The \ngovernment\u2019s public health response to COVID-19, including closing the borders, has prevented \nentry  of  the  disease  into  the  country.  However,  it  has  come  at  a  high  economic  cost.  Income-\ngenerating opportunities are scarce and mostly based on natural resources. Exports have been \nhit hard because of COVID-19. As a small, open economy, the country is highly dependent on \nexports,  which  represent  42%  of  gross  domestic  product  (GDP).  The  formal  social  protection \nsystem is limited in both programs and coverage, and therefore the government\u2019s ability to directly \nsupport  the  poorest  and  most  vulnerable  through  existing  programs  is  constrained.  Solomon \nIslands is prone to disasters caused by natural hazards. When tropical cyclone Harold struck in \nearly April 2020, the country\u2019s thin capacity was stretched even further by having to respond to \ntwo shocks simultaneously. The country is ranked 145th of 160 countries in the United Nations \neconomic vulnerability index.3 These fragilities highlight the country\u2019s nonlinear development path \nand need for significant support from development partners.  \n \n4. \nOption under the Countercyclical Support Facility (Table 1).4 \n \n \n\nSolomon Islands meets all the access criteria of ADB\u2019s COVID-19 Pandemic Response \n\n \n\n1   ADB. 2020.

Honiara. \n\n3  United  Nations.  https://www.un.org/development/desa/dpad/publication/2018-vulnerability-profiles/ \n\n(accessed \n\n21 May 2020). \n\n4   A detailed justification is in Appendix 4.  \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nTable 1: Assessment of Compliance with the Access Criteria for the Countercyclical \nSupport Facility and the COVID-19 Pandemic Response Option \n\nAccess Criterion \n\n1.  Adverse impact of \n\nexogenous \nshocks \n\n2.  Countercyclical \ndevelopment \nexpenditures \n\nAsian Development Bank Assessment \n\nIn 2020, the economy is projected to contract by 5% and the fiscal deficit is projected to \nincrease by 4.6 percentage points to 7.3% of GDP. External debt as a percentage of GDP \nis expected to almost double to 17.8% in 2020 as a result of the need to finance this deficit. \nThe current account deficit will increase by 6.4 percentage points to 15% of GDP in 2020. \nPoverty is projected to increase from 23.6% in 2018 to 27.5% in 2020.   \n\nThe  government  has  approved  a  total  of  SI$446  million  ($54  million)  to  respond  to  the \ncrisis,  comprising  of  two  components:  a  COVID-19  preparedness  and  response  plan \n($16.5 million)  and an  economic stimulus  package  ($37.5 million).  The  first component \nhas  allocations  for  health,  education,  and  social  protection  measures.  The  second \ncomponent  has  allocations  for  additional  social  protection  measures,  including  through \ntargeted  investments in  agriculture,  fisheries,  and  tourism; support  to small  businesses \nand state-owned enterprises; and bringing forward infrastructure projects.  \n\n3.  Pre-shock record \n\nof generally sound \nmacroeconomic \nmanagement \n\nEconomic growth was 3.9% in 2018 and 2.7% in 2019. Inflation was low at 1.9% in 2019. \nThere was a fiscal surplus of 0.7% of GDP in 2018 and a fiscal deficit of 2.7% of GDP in \n2019. The current account deficit was 8.6% in 2019. Foreign reserves were equivalent to \n8.1 months of import cover. \n\n4.  Structural reforms \n(including health \nresponse) \n\nThe Governor-General declared a state of emergency on 25 March 2020 and Parliament \nextended it by for 4 months to 25 July. An initial amount of SI$27 million ($2.5 million) has \nbeen allocated to upgrade hospitals, particularly by building isolation units that could be \nused as intensive care units. Medical personnel are being trained on infectious disease \nissues. Testing equipment is available and medical supplies are being stockpiled. Public \nawareness  campaigns  are  underway.  Development  partners  are  providing  funding  to \nsupplement the government\u2019s efforts. \n\n5.  Debt sustainability \n\nAs a result of the crisis, the public debt\u2013GDP ratio is expected to increase from 10.1% of \nGDP in 2019 to 17.8% in 2020 and 31.8% in 2024. Debt sustainability analyses conducted \nby ADB and the IMF conclude that Solomon Islands\u2019 public debt remains sustainable. \n\n6.  Coordination with \n\nthe IMF \n\nADB was the government\u2019s lead development partner in preparing the economic stimulus \npackage. ADB actively engaged with the IMF on the design of the package to ensure that \nthe IMF\u2019s policy advice was reflected in the final document. The IMF approved a $28.5 \nmillion program on 1 June 2020. ADB and the IMF have discussed arrangements for joint \nmonitoring of their respective programs where feasible.  \n\nADB = Asian Development Bank, COVID-19 = coronavirus disease, GDP = gross domestic product, IMF = International \nMonetary Fund, SI$ = Solomon Islands dollar. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n\nII. \n\nPROGRAM AND RATIONALE \n\nBackground and Development Constraints \n\n \nA. \n \nDevelopment  context.  Solomon  Islands  is  ranked  153rd  on  the  United  Nations \n5. \nDevelopment Programme\u2019s human development index for 2019 and is among the least developed \ncountries  in  the  world. 5  Solomon  Islands  is  predominantly  rural,  with  81%  of  the  country\u2019s \npopulation  of  652,000  living  in  rural  villages  spread  throughout  its  9  provinces,  covering  20 \nislands. The country\u2019s economy is highly dependent on commodity prices and demand from the \nPeople\u2019s  Republic  of  China,  which  receives  66.8%  of  exports,  representing  28%  of  Solomon \nIslands\u2019  GDP. 6 Government  constitutes  a  large  proportion  of  the  economy,  with  government \nexpenditure  constituting  41.6%  of  GDP  in  2019.  Solomon  Islands  is  categorized  as  a  least \n\n5  United \n\nNations. \n\nhttps://www.un.org/development/desa/dpad/least-developed-country-category-solomon-\n\n6  International  Monetary  Fund  (IMF).  2020.  Solomon  Islands:  Staff  Report  for  the  2019  Article  IV  Consultation. \n\n \n\nislands.html (accessed 21 May 2020). \n\nWashington, DC.  \n\n\fdeveloped country, although it is scheduled to graduate in 2024.7 While poverty has declined in \nrecent years, Solomon Islands has the second-lowest gross national income per capita among \nPacific  developing  member  countries  ($2,020  in  2018). 8 With  the  World  Health  Organization \n(WHO)  declaring  COVID-19  a  global  pandemic,  the  Governor-General  declared  a  state  of \nemergency on 25 March 2020, which gave the Prime Minister broad powers to fight the pandemic. \nOn  27  March  2020,  the  government  suspended  all  international  passenger  flights.  On  7  April \n2020, Parliament extended the state of emergency for 4 months to 25 July 2020. \n \nSolomon  Islands  is  ranked  sixth  in  the  world  for  vulnerability  to  disasters  triggered  by \n6. \nnatural hazards.9 When tropical cyclone Harold hit the country, more than 30% of the population \nwere exposed to a combination of heavy rainfall and strong winds leading to secondary impacts \nsuch as storm surges, flooding, and landslides. This resulted in some loss of life and damage to \nproperty, food and water sources, and the natural environment.  \n \n7. \nPre-shock record of generally sound macroeconomic management. The government \nmaintained  a  prudent  approach  to  macroeconomic  management  before  the  pandemic,  as \nreflected in its economic indicators (Table 2). Economic growth was a respectable 3.9% in 2018 \nand  2.7% \nfisheries,  agriculture,  and \nmanufacturing. ADB had revised its growth projections upward to 2.7% for 2020, mainly because \nconstruction  was  starting  on  significant  infrastructure  projects.10 There  was  a  fiscal  surplus  of \n0.7% of GDP in 2018 and a fiscal deficit of 2.7% of GDP in 2019. This reversal was driven by \nlower logging revenues and higher public sector payroll costs. The government, with support from \nADB  and  other  development  partners,  has  been  implementing  a  public  financial  management \nreform  action  plan  across  several  work  streams,  including  (i)  improving  budget  credibility,  (ii) \nimplementing  commitment  controls,  (iii)  institutionalizing  a  comprehensive  approach  to  cash \nmanagement, and (iv) supporting greater accountability of discretionary funds.11 While the current \naccount deficit was 8.6% of GDP in 2019, official reserves have more than 8 months of import \ncover. The country\u2019s external public debt level was relatively low, at 10.1% of GDP, but this was \nprojected to increase because of the government\u2019s ambitious infrastructure construction program. \nInflation was low at 1.9% in 2019. \n \n\nin  2019,  underpinned  by \n\ninfrastructure, \n\nlogging, \n\nTable 2: Pre-COVID-19 Macroeconomic Indicators \n\n2015 \n\n2016 \n\n2017 \n\n2018 \n\n2019p \n\nItem \nGDP growth (%, constant prices) \nInflation (CPI period average) \nTotal revenue (% of GDP) \nTotal revenue and grants (% of GDP) \nExpenditure (% of GDP) \nOverall fiscal surplus (deficit) (% of GDP) \nGross external public debt (% of GDP) \nGross official foreign reserves ($ million) \n     In months of imports \nCurrent account balance (% of GDP) \n\n2.5 \n(0.6) \n35.1 \n47.9 \n48.0 \n(0.0) \n7.5 \n519.6 \n10.0 \n(3.0) \n\n3.2 \n0.5 \n31.8 \n43.2 \n47.1 \n(3.9) \n7.6 \n513.6 \n9.1 \n(4.0) \n\n3.7 \n0.5 \n32.8 \n43.1 \n47.5 \n(4.4) \n7.1 \n576.9 \n9.3 \n(4.9) \n\n3.9 \n3.5 \n34.3 \n45.3 \n44.6 \n0.7 \n7.6 \n613.1 \n8.5 \n(4.5) \n\n2.7 \n1.9 \n30.1 \n39.0 \n41.6 \n(2.7) \n10.1 \n601.5 \n8.1 \n(8.6) \n\n( ) = negative, COVID-19 = coronavirus disease, CPI = consumer price index, GDP = gross domestic product,  \np= projected. \nNotes: Statistics for 2019 are estimates.  \nSource: International Monetary Fund Article IV Reports. \n \n\n \n\n7  United  Nations. https://unctad.org/en/Pages/ALDC/Least%20Developed%20Countries/UN-list-of-Least-Developed-\n\nCountries.aspx (accessed 21 May 2020). \n\n8   World Bank data. https://data.worldbank.org/country/solomon-islands (accessed 21 May 2020). \n9   United Nations University, Institute for Environment and Human Security. 2016.

Solomon Islands: Strengthening the Fundamentals of Public Finance Management. Washington, DC. \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\nWeak health system unable to cope with large numbers of COVID-19 patients. Health \n8. \nservices are delivered through a network consisting of 1 national referral hospital in Honiara, 11 \nprovincial hospitals, 35 area health centers, 107 rural health clinics, and 190 nurse aid posts.12 \nThe skills mix and distribution of health workers across provinces is generally uneven. Some 84% \nof  medical  practitioners  and  53%  of  nursing  staff  are  based  in  Honiara.  Many  health  facilities \noperate  without  adequate  water  and  sanitation;  electricity;  or  basic  medical,  diagnostic,  and \nsurgical  equipment.  However,  Solomon  Islands  is  served  by  a  well-trained  nursing  workforce, \nwhich  provides  the  backbone  of  service  delivery  in  rural  areas,  and  the  number  of  doctors  is \nincreasing.  \n \n9. \nCompared  with  its  peer  Pacific  small  island  states,  Solomon  Islands  generally  lags  in \nterms of hospital beds, nurses and midwives, and physicians. There are no intensive care unit \nbeds in the country and only two ventilators (with an additional seven on order). In late 2019, the \nGlobal Health Security Index, which benchmarks countries on pandemic preparedness, ranked \nSolomon Islands 183rd of 195 countries.13  \n \nHealth  impact  of  COVID-19.  As  of  2  June  2020,  Solomon  Islands  had  no  reported \n10. \nCOVID-19  cases.  This  is  attributable  to  the  government\u2019s  decisive  containment  measures  to \nprevent people from entering the country and its relative isolation. The first travel restriction came \ninto  force  on  1  February  2020.  Restrictions  became  progressively  stricter,  including  increased \npatrols  between  Papua  New  Guinea  and  Solomon  Islands  to  enforce  the  border  closure. \nHowever, Solomon Islands is at risk of the rapid spread of COVID-19 infections because of its \nweak public health system, insufficient testing and tracing systems, and underdeveloped water \nsupply and sanitation services. Common noncommunicable diseases, such as diabetes and adult \nobesity, increase vulnerability to COVID-19.  \n \n11. \nEconomic impact of COVID-19 and transmission mechanisms. The Central Bank of \nSolomon  Islands  (CBSI)  forecasts  a  5%  contraction  of  GDP. 14  Other  key  macroeconomic \nvariables are also expected to worsen in 2020. The current account deficit is projected to increase \nfrom  8.6%  of  GDP  in  2019  to  15.0%  in  2020  (footnote  6).  The  exogenous  shock  will  be \nconcentrated in the external sector. Logs account for 71.6% of all exports and 22% of government \nrevenues. Nearly half of the workforce is thought to be directly or indirectly associated with the \nlogging industry. Tourism, which is another important transmission mechanism, represents 5% of \nGDP. With no passenger arrivals, tourism has dropped to almost zero and may stay low for the \nremainder  of  2020.  The  government  has  an  ambitious  infrastructure  program,  but  this  work \nprogram has stalled because of its reliance on imports of raw materials and skilled foreign labor. \nAt 1.5% of GDP, remittances are a small, but growing, source of income for the country, and a \nkey source of cash for poor and vulnerable households. Remittances are expected to fall because \nworkers cannot go to Australia and New Zealand, which have dedicated labor mobility schemes \nfor people from the Pacific. \n \n12. \nFiscal  impact  of  COVID-19.  A  fiscal  deficit  of  2.7%  of  GDP  was  projected  before  the \nonset  of  the  COVID-19  pandemic.  As  of  February  2020,  the  government\u2019s  cash  on  hand  was \nalready tight at 0.6 months of monthly expenses. This caused the government to manage its cash \nflow carefully, with a risk of accumulation of arrears. In March 2020, the government implemented \nmeasures to contain discretionary expenditures, such as reducing public servants\u2019 overseas travel \n\n \n\n12  WHO. 2015.

With the COVID-19 pandemic, the fiscal deficit is expected \nto  rise to  7.3%  of GDP because  of  an  expected  decline  in  revenues  and  higher  expenditures. \nRevenue declines will be led by lower logging and decreased economic activity will reduce income \nand consumption tax revenues. Government expenditure is increasing, especially in the health \nsector, but also through the Economic Stimulus Package (ESP). Fiscal deficits are projected to \npeak in 2020 and decline slowly during 2021\u20132024 but at lower levels, averaging 5.8% of GDP.  \n \n13. \nSocioeconomic impacts of COVID-19. The COVID-19 pandemic will have a profound \nsocioeconomic impact on the poor and vulnerable, especially women. More than 80% of workers \nare  employed  in the  informal  sector.  More  women  than  men  are  informal  workers  and  75%  of \nwomen are in vulnerable employment.15 Interventions to prevent the entry and  spread of COVID-\n19 have already resulted in many women losing their livelihoods in the informal sector (such as \nroadside  and market  vendors,  and microentrepreneurs).  Decreases  in  income  will  impact food \nsecurity and nutrition for households without produce gardens or subsistence farms. In addition, \nthere have already been job losses for women in hotels, restaurants, and casinos, where about \ntwo-thirds of staff are women; and a loss of sales in other tourism-related businesses such as \nhandicrafts.  Key  factories that  predominantly  employ  women,  such  as  SolTuna,  where  56%  of \nstaff are women, have also announced that they will lay off workers if there is a lockdown.  \n \n14. \nThere  is  no  unemployment  insurance  to  support  people  who  lose  their  jobs.  The \nsuspension  of  nonessential  procedures  by  public  health  facilities  also  threatens  women\u2019s \ncontinued access to maternal and reproductive health services. The loss of income suffered by \nmany  people  means  that  they  are  unable  to  afford  private  doctors  or  medicines,  and  many \nsicknesses  and  chronic  conditions  are  not  being  treated.  This  further  heightens  vulnerability \namong  the  elderly,  people  with  disabilities,  and  those  with  preexisting  health  conditions.  In \naddition,  already  high  levels  of  gender-based  violence  (GBV)  are  expected  to  increase, \nparticularly if there are restrictions on movement.16  \n \nB. \n\nThe  Government\u2019s  COVID-19  Preparedness  and  Response  Plan  and  Economic \nStimulus Package \n\n \n15. \nThe government\u2019s response program consists of two major components totaling 3.7% of \nGDP: (i) the SI$137 million ($16.5 million) CPRP, approved by the Cabinet on 26 March 2020, \nwhich  aims  to  minimize  the  risk  of  importation  and  spread  of  COVID-19  and  reduce  societal \ndisruption; and (ii) the SI$309 million ($37.5 million) ESP, announced on 4 May 2020, which is \ndesigned to ameliorate the economic impact of the pandemic, both immediately and in the short- \nto medium-term. \n \n16. \nIn  February  2020,  the  government  established  a  multiagency  COVID-19  oversight \ncommittee,  chaired  by  the  Secretary  to  the  Cabinet,  to  coordinate  the  whole-of-government \npreparedness  and  response  to  COVID-19.  The  COVID-19  oversight  committee  ensures,  on \nbehalf of Cabinet, the implementation of the CPRP. The National Disaster Operations Committee \nundertakes  day-to-day  coordination.  The  CPRP  established  eight  subcommittees  to  monitor \nactivities.  There  is  also  an  economic  stimulus  oversight  committee  responsible  for  monitoring \n\n \n\n15 Vulnerable employees are less likely to have formal work arrangements and are therefore more likely to lack decent \nworking conditions, adequate social security, and voice through effective representation by trade unions and similar \norganizations. Vulnerable employment is often characterized by inadequate earnings, low productivity, and difficult \nwork conditions that undermine workers\u2019 fundamental rights. \n\n16  Fully 41.8% of Solomon Islands women reported that they experienced physical and/or sexual violence by an intimate \npartner in the last year. The prevalence increases to 63.5% if lifetime experience is captured. More than 30% of \nwomen  reported  being  sexually  abused  before  the  age  of  15.  (ADB.  2015.  Solomon  Islands  Country  Gender \nAssessment. Manila.) \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\nactivities to be delivered by the ESP. It reports directly to Cabinet and its secretariat functions are \nundertaken by the Ministry of Finance and Treasury (MOFT).  \n \n17. \nPoverty  and  vulnerability  extend  throughout  the  general  population,  with  57%  of  the \npopulation living on less than $3.10 per person per day, only 16% connected to the electricity grid, \nand nearly half of rural households without access to toilet facilities. Considering also the lack of \ndeveloped social protection systems, activities targeting poor or vulnerable groups are embedded \nacross the various sub-components of the government\u2019s program, as described below. \n \n\n1. \n\nCOVID-19 Preparedness and Response Plan \n\n \n18. \nThe CPRP encompasses five areas: (i) establishing an integrated management system of \npreparedness and response through a whole-of-government sector approach, (ii) implementing \nhealth  systems  preparedness  and  response  measures,  (iii)  implementing  education  systems \npreparedness and response measures, (iv) implementing livelihood preparedness and response \nmeasures, and (v) ensuring the safety and security of communities and health professionals.17 \n \n19. \nScaling  up  the  health  response.  Significant  activities  have  been  implemented  with \ndevelopment  partner  support,  including  the  addition  of  15  isolation  unit  beds  at  the  national \nreferral  hospital  and  installation  of  a  COVID-19  testing  machine  at  the  national  laboratory. 18 \nHowever,  significant  challenges  and  gaps  remain,  particularly  in  the  outer  islands,  including \nshortages  of  laboratory  supplies  and  insufficient  personal  protective  equipment  for  frontline \nworkers. Laboratory staff are receiving training on the use of test kits. An outbreak of COVID-19 \nwould require significant additional increases in health expenditure. \n \n20. \nSocial protection measures. Social protection measures under the CPRP are delivered \nunder  the  oversight  of the  livelihood  and  protection  subcommittees.  Preparedness  activities  to \nensure  food  security  include  assessing  food  stocks,  stockpiling  food  rations,  enhancing  food \nproduction,  and  ensuring  the  adequate  and  timely  distribution  of  emergency  food  rations.  The \nCPRP  provides  1  month\u2019s  food  rations  for  100,000  households,  including  about  10,000 \nhouseholds  headed  by  women,  should  a  COVID-19  case  be  identified  and  further  restrictions \nimposed. People living in urban areas (19% of the population), who have less access to gardens \nand  other  subsistence  sources,  would  be  prioritized.  The  Protection  Committee  is  tasked  with \nensuring  that  vulnerable  groups  have  equal  access  to  services  and  resources  that  meet  their \nessential  needs.  This  includes  establishing  active  child  protection  and  GBV  subcommittees, \nensuring counselling services are available, coordinating with counselling providers and ensuring \nthey  have  access  to  personal  protective  equipment,  readying  public  awareness  campaigns  to \neradicate  stigma  or  discrimination  against  those  infected  with  COVID-19,  and  assessing \nquarantine  facilities  to  ensure  they  cater  for  people  with  special  needs  and  other  vulnerable \ngroups. \n \n\n2. \n\nEconomic Stimulus Package \n\n \nThe ESP is a combination of immediate measures to prop up aggregate demand and meet \n21. \nsocial  protection  needs,  short-  to  medium-term  measures  to  support  the  economy  during  the \nrecovery  phase,  and  medium-term  measures  to  promote  growth.  The  package  contains  six \nactivities (paras. 22\u201328). \n\nCoronavirus (COVID-19). Honiara. \n\n \n\n17  Government  of  Solomon  Islands.  2020.  Consolidated  N-DOC  Preparedness  and  Response  Plan  for  Novel \n\n18  ADB  provided  a  surge  capacity  specialist  to  strengthen  clinical  management  of  COVID-19  patients,  infection \n\nprevention control, and capacity building for surveillance and contract tracing. \n\n\fSupport for farmers as a form of social protection. This activity has multiple purposes, \n22. \nincluding  increasing the incomes  of farmers  (a  vulnerable  group),  enhancing  Solomon Islands\u2019 \nfood security, and supporting a pathway to greater economic diversification and growth. This new \ngovernment activity has targeted 35,000 crop and livestock farmers, with at least 10,000 by June \n2021, and is prioritizing subsistence farmers who lack the funds or skills to expand production. \nGovernment support will include providing planting materials, fertilizer, pesticides, and training; \nensuring  minimum  prices;  supporting  compliance  with  food  safety  standards;  and  subsidizing \nfreight costs. The government will conduct gender analysis to understand women\u2019s participation \nthroughout  the  value  chain  to  ensure  that  female  entrepreneurs  and  other  small  agricultural \ncooperatives can be supported. SI$70 million ($8.6 million) has been allocated. \n \n23. \nSupport  for  forestry,  fisheries,  and  tourism  as  a  form  of  social  protection.  The \ngovernment is keen to diversify the economy and increase the incomes of fishers and tourism \noperators. The government has indicated that artisanal fishers and small tourism operators will \nbe the focus. For fishers, the government will provide training and cold storage around the country, \nsubsidize  freight  costs,  and  open  niche  export  markets.  For  tourism  operators,  there  will  be \ntraining,  the  possibility  of  minor  capital  works,  and  greater  marketing  of  Solomon  Islands  as  a \ntourist destination. The government will provide support to the few sustainable forestry plantations \nto  help  these  businesses  expand  their  planting,  milling,  and  exports.  Support  will  be  linked  to \nattainable  production  targets  and  maintaining  employment  levels.19 SI$44  million  ($5.5  million) \nhas been allocated.  \n \n24. \nSocial  protection  and  community  support  measures.  The  government  will  provide \nSI$5  million  ($0.6  million)  in  grants to  churches and  provincial  authorities  to support  outreach, \nadvocacy,  and  awareness-raising  activities  on  social  distancing,  proper  hygiene,  available \ngovernment health services, and support to the poor and vulnerable households to weather the \ncrisis. In addition, the government will provide SI$5 ($0.6 million) million to help schools prepare \nto  resume  classes.  This  includes  funds  for  hand  sanitizer,  face  masks,  and  improved  toilet \nfacilities. These measures will ensure continued investment in social services and will address \nthe  direct  impacts  of  the  health  crisis  and  recovery.  Finally,  the  government  has  directed \nbusinesses to maintain their pre-crisis prices and reminded them not to distribute unsafe or low-\nquality goods. The government has allocated SI$5 million ($0.6 million) to contract women and \nyouths to monitor prices according to price control regulations and report any breaches.  \n \n25. \nSupport to micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises. The government will directly \nsupport micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) by (i) creating a SI$5 million ($0.6 \nmillion) facility to enable MSMEs to pay their rent; (ii) extending deadlines to pay taxes, and giving \na 5-year income tax break to businesses that are most directly affected by the pandemic, such as \ntourism;  and  (iii)  providing  the  Development  Bank  of  Solomon  Islands with  SI$20 million  ($2.4 \nmillion) in equity and a further SI$15 million ($1.8 million) credit line to enable it to provide loans \nto MSMEs, including those owned by women. \n \n26. \nSupport  to  state-owned  enterprises  and  large  employers.  Many  state-owned \nenterprises  (SOEs)  provide  essential  services  and  are  large  employers.  The  government  will \nprovide  support  to  these  businesses  to  enable  them  to  continue  their  operations,  maintain \nemployment,  and recover  once  the  crisis  is  over.  Solomon  Airlines, the  primary  provider  of  air \nservices,  has  been  financially  devastated  by  international  travel  restrictions.  To  enable  it  to \ncontinue  operating  domestically  and  to  bring  in  essential  freight,  especially  for  the  Ministry  of \nHealth and Medical Services, the government will provide it with additional equity of SI$5 million \n\n19 The government has committed to collecting sex-disaggregated data on employment targets. \n\n \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\n($0.6  million)  and  a  loan  of  SI$15  million  ($1.8  million).  Solomon  Water  recently  started  an \nextensive capital works program, with ADB support, and its balance sheet has weakened.20 To \nensure  service  delivery  is  not  compromised,  the  government  will  provide  it  with  a  SI$5  million \n($0.6 million) capital injection. SolTuna, which is an important exporter and large employer, will \nreceive SI$5 ($0.6 million) million in new equity. The Commodity Export Marketing Authority will \nreceive SI$2 million ($0.2 million) for marketing and testing the quality of agricultural products. \nThe government will provide SI$18 million ($2.2 million) to large private businesses to help them \nmaintain employment and continue exporting. \n \n27. \nInfrastructure  projects.  This  activity  will  provide  employment  by  financing  the \nconstruction  of  wharves  linking  agriculture  hubs  in  Kirakira  and  Malu\u2019u  (SI$39  million  or  $4.7 \nmillion), bridge building in Malaita (SI$30 million or $3.6 million), and the upgrading of airstrips in \nSeghe and Taro (SI$21 million or $2.5 million). To ensure that these projects bring the greatest \neconomic benefit to these regions, local labor-intensive systems will be used where possible and \nmaterials will be sourced locally where feasible. \n\nProposed Program, Impact, and ADB\u2019s Value Addition \n\n \nThe ESP includes the following activities which, while not funded from the government\u2019s \n28. \nbudget,  will  support  vulnerable  people  and  businesses:  (i)  each  Solomon  Islands  National \nProvident Fund member will be able to access SI$5,000, which is expected to inject SI$200 million \n($24  million)  into  the  economy;  (ii)  banks  have  offered  to  defer  debt  repayments  for  up  to  6 \nmonths; (iii) Solomon Power lowered its May 2020 tariff by 16% (reducing its revenues by SI$6 \nmillion or $0.7 million); (iv) Solomon Islands Port Authority removed its domestic port charges for \nApril and May 2020 (costing it SI$6 million or $0.7 million) and is providing 2 extra days of free \nstorage  for  imports  and  exports  through  July  2020;  (v)  the  wholesale  supplier  of  internet \nconnectivity  from  the  recently  installed  submarine  cable  has  increased  bandwidth  to  retail \ntelecommunications operators by 50% for 4 months at no additional cost; and (vi) the government \npolicy, announced in late March, of halving the salaries of nonessential public servants (about \n25%  of  public  servants) starting  in May  is  reversed,  and  these  public  servants  will  continue  to \ndraw their normal salaries. \n \nC. \n \nADB\u2019s program will contribute to the government\u2019s efforts in containing the pandemic and \n29. \naddressing its social and economic impact, particularly on the poor and vulnerable. The outcome \nwill be adverse effects of COVID-19 on businesses and the population reduced. The program will \nhave three outputs: (i) measures to combat the entry and spread of COVID-19 in Solomon Islands \ndelivered;  (ii)  measures  to  provide  social  assistance  to  vulnerable  groups  enhanced;  and  (iii) \neconomic stimulus delivered. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n30. \nADB\u2019s value addition. A regular (often daily) dialogue between the government team and \nthe  ADB team, comprising  headquarters, regional  office,  and  Solomon Islands  Pacific  Country \nOffice  staff  and  consultants,  was  key  in  supporting  the  design  of  the  government\u2019s  ESP.  The \npolicy  dialogue  enabled  the  teams  to  discuss  and  agree  on  the  macroeconomic  analysis  and \nappropriate  policy  responses.  Complementary  to  ADB\u2019s  policy  advice,  ADB  quickly  mobilized \ntechnical  assistance  (TA)  to  facilitate  dialogue,  support  the  collection  of  data,  and  give  the \ngovernment  additional  support  to  execute  its  countercyclical  expenditure  program.  Given  the \ngovernment\u2019s  limited  capacity,  ADB  is  providing  TA  to  monitor  the  program\u2019s  outcome  and \noutputs, and will provide further TA to support the government in implementing the ESP.21 ADB \n\n20  ADB. 2019.

Manila. \n\n \n\n\fprovided  a  surge  capacity  specialist  to  strengthen  clinical  management  of  COVID-19  patients, \ninfection prevention control, and capacity building for surveillance and contact tracing. \n \n31. \nLessons  learned.  ADB  has  worked  with  the  MOFT  and  conducted  policy  dialogue  for \npolicy-based operations for an extended period. This engagement has focused on public financial \nmanagement and private sector development. The last program was completed in 2018.22 More \nrecently, ADB has provided TA focusing on tax reforms and improving budget execution (footnote \n21). The lessons from this experience include the need to (i) interact regularly with the government \ngiven its limited capacity, (ii) provide TA to supplement capacity, (iii) use existing mechanisms to \ndeliver  support  as  creating  new  transmission  mechanisms  takes  time  and  capacity,  (iv)  link \nimmediate  policy  responses  with  longer-term  support,  and  (v)  coordinate  with  development \npartners. \n \n32. \nADB\u2019s pipeline. In meeting the government\u2019s desire for medium-term policy responses \nto  support  higher  economic  growth  and  address  gaps  that  became  apparent  during  the  crisis, \nADB is ensuring that its future TA, project, and program pipeline is responsive to the government\u2019s \nchanging priorities. ADB\u2019s current regional TA projects will support the government in its work to \nmeet  the  financing  needs  of  MSMEs  and  sustainable  infrastructure. 23  New  region-wide  TA \nprojects on social protection; MSMEs; gender; and water, sanitation, and hygiene will provide a \nbasis for larger interventions. ADB will continue its policy dialogue on public financial management \nand private sector development. Building on its TA on tax reform, ADB is designing a program \nthat will broaden the tax base and actively support economic growth (footnote 21). ADB is well \nadvanced in drawing up detailed designs and conducting due diligence for a land and maritime \ntransport  project,  which  the  government  sees  as  an  important  component  of  its  overall \ninfrastructure  program  and  provide  jobs  for  Solomon  Islanders.  Future  health  and  education \nprojects will address gaps exposed during this crisis.  \n \n33. \nAlignment  with  Strategy  2030  and  the  Pacific  Approach.  The  proposed  program  is \naligned  with  ADB\u2019s  Strategy  2030,  particularly  the  operational  priorities  related  to  addressing \npoverty, promoting rural development and food security, accelerating progress in gender equality, \nstrengthening governance and institutional capacity, and strengthening regional cooperation and \nintegration. 24  The  program  reflects  Strategy  2030\u2019s  approach  to  fragile  and  conflict-affected \nsituations and small island developing states, which recognizes their vulnerability to exogenous \nshocks  and  institutional  capacity  constraints.  The  program  is  aligned  with  the  three  strategic \npriorities  of  ADB\u2019s  Pacific  Approach,  2016\u20132020,  which  serves  as  the  country  strategy  for \nSolomon Islands, specifically reducing costs, managing risks, and enabling value creation.25 \n \nD. \n \n34. \nGovernment-led  coordination.  The  government,  through  its  oversight  committees, \nprovides strategic direction and coordination.

Under the Biketawa Declaration, a framework agreed to by all the leaders \nof  the  Pacific  Island  Forum  countries  for  coordinating  responses  to  regional  crises,  Solomon \nIslands  is  also  entitled to  assistance  through the  Pacific  Humanitarian Pathway  on  COVID-19. \nThis is coordinated with regional and global bodies such as WHO.26 The World Bank is preparing \na $5 million health project under its fast-track facility for COVID-19 response.27 \n \n35. \nADB  coordination  as  lead  development  partner  in  preparing  Economic  Stimulus \nPackage. ADB and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) have had regular bilateral meetings on \nmacroeconomic  and  fiscal  issues,  and  as  part  of  wider  development  partner  discussions  on \nsupporting the government during the crisis. ADB, as lead donor supporting the government in \npreparing the ESP, coordinated the policy advice provided by Australia, the European Union, the \nIMF, New Zealand, and the World Bank.  \n \nE. \n \n36. \nSolomon  Islands\u2019  revised  fiscal  deficit  for  2020  is  7.3%  of  GDP.  The  government\u2019s \nfinancing requirement is expected to reach $106.9 million, including a financing gap caused by \nCOVID-19  of  about  $52.2  million.  This  financing  gap,  which  is  attributable  to  lower  revenue \nbecause of lower economic activity and higher expenditure as a result of the ESP package and \nhigher health expenditures, will be largely financed by development partners. ADB will provide \n$26 million in 2020, of which $20 million is from this program and $6 million was provided in April \n2020  under  the  Pacific  Disaster  Resilience  Program.28 The  balance  will  be  provided  by  other \ndevelopment partners and a domestic bond issuance (Table 3). There is still a small financing \ngap which will be resolved by finding savings in the budget or additional budget support. \n \n\nDevelopment Financing Needs, Budget Support, and Debt Sustainability  \n\nTable 3: Urgent Financing Needs and Support for 2020 ($ million) \n\n2020 (before COVID-19)  2020 (adjusted for COVID-19) \n\nItem \nFinancing requirement \nDomestic sources \n\nDomestic bond issuance \nDividends from state-owned enterprises \nSubtotal \nExternal sources \n\nADB COVID-19 Pandemic Response Option \nADB Pacific Disaster Resilience Programa \nAustralia \nEuropean Union \nInternational Monetary Fundb \nNew Zealand \nWorld Bank \nSubtotal \n\nTotals \n\n54.7 \n \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n \n0.0 \n0.0 \n8.5 \n6.7 \n0.0 \n1.8 \n10.0 \n27.0 \n27.0 \n\n106.9 \n \n14.5 \n1.8 \n16.3 \n \n20.0 \n6.0 \n8.5 \n6.7 \n28.5 \n1.8 \n15.0 \n86.5 \n102.8 \n\nADB = Asian Development Bank, COVID-19 = coronavirus disease. \na Comprising a $3 million concessional ordinary capital resources loan and a $3 million Asian Development Fund grant. \nb Financed using the Rapid Financing Instrument and Rapid Credit Facility. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n\n \n\n26 The Humanitarian Pathway on COVID-19 supports the timely movement of medical supplies, technical experts, and \nhumanitarian assistance to Pacific Island Forum Members.

COVID-19 Emergency Response Project. Washington, DC. \n28  ADB. 2019. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Policy-Based Loan \n\nand Policy-Based Grants for the Proposed Pacific Disaster Resilience Program (Phase 2). Manila. \n\n\fThe government has requested (i) a concessional loan of $10 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary \n37. \ncapital resources, and (ii) a grant not exceeding $10 million from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources \n(Asian  Development  Fund)  to  help  finance  the  program.  The  loan  will  have  a  24-year  term, \nincluding a grace period of 8 years; an interest rate of 1.0% per year during the grace period and \n1.5% per year thereafter; and such other terms and conditions as are set forth in the draft loan \nagreement. The government\u2019s development policy letter is in Appendix 3. \n \n38. \nIn 2019, Solomon Islands\u2019 public debt\u2013GDP ratio was low at 10.1%. Public external debt \nstood at $98 million, primarily from ADB (50%) and the International Development Association \n(39%). Public domestic debt stood at SI$245 million ($29.6 million), which was primarily bonds \nissued to the Solomon Islands National Provident Fund (SI$180 million or $21.6 million). On 25 \nApril  2020,  the  government  issued  a  SI$120  million  ($14.5  million)  COVID-19  domestic \ndevelopment bond. The current low debt levels leave space to absorb shocks such as the COVID-\n19 pandemic. With most development partners providing support through grants, public external \ndebt by the end of 2020 will still be at prudent levels, with a debt\u2013GDP ratio of 17.8%, despite the \neconomic contraction. However, the ratio is projected to increase to 31.8% by 2024 because of \nsignificant  new  infrastructure  projects.  The  debt  sustainability  analyses  of  ADB  and  the  IMF \nconclude  that  Solomon  Islands\u2019  public  debt  remains  sustainable  and  at  moderate  risk  of  debt \ndistress despite its rising trend, and that the loan provided under the program will not aggravate \nthe country\u2019s debt vulnerability and risks in the medium term.  \n \nF. \n \n39. \nThe MOFT will be the executing agency for the program. The MOFT will monitor budget \nexecution and the flow of funds for countercyclical measures, and will submit quarterly reports to \nADB on expenditures made from the national budget to support the countercyclical measures. \nADB  will  provide  TA  resources  to  supplement  the  government\u2019s  capacity  in  monitoring  the \nimplementation  of  the  government\u2019s  program.  In  coordination  with  the  government  and  other \ndevelopment partners, ADB will monitor outcome-level information throughout the implementation \nof the program using an existing TA (footnote 21). The ADB program implementation period is \nFebruary 2020 to June 2021. The loan and grant will be disbursed to a government account at \nthe CBSI in a single tranche upon loan and grant effectiveness, which is expected in July 2020. \nThe  proceeds  of  the  loan  and  grant  will  be  withdrawn  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan \nDisbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from time to time).29 \n \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\n40. \nGovernance. The latest public expenditure and financial accountability assessment took \nplace in 2012. It showed that most areas of public financial management had improved since the \n2008 assessment, particularly in budget credibility, budget comprehensiveness and transparency, \nand policy-based budgeting. ADB is providing TA to help the MOFT improve budget execution, \nwhich  will  also  support  monitoring  of  the  government\u2019s  countercyclical  program  (footnote  21). \nADB provided support for corporate governance reform, which contributed to a turnaround in the \nfinancial  performance  of  SOEs.  There  is  a  lack  of  procurement  capacity  and  expertise  in \ngovernment ministries. An anticorruption act was adopted in 2018. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy \n(1998, as amended to date) was explained to the government and the MOFT. \n \nPoverty. Although poverty has declined considerably\u2014from 45.6% of the population living \n41. \nbelow  the  international  poverty  line  of  $1.90  per  day  in  2006  to  23.6%  in  2018\u2014it  remains \n\n29 List of Ineligible Items (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n11 \n\n \n\n\f12 \n\n \n\nsubstantial.  Two-thirds  of  rural  households  must  travel  to  their  main  source  of  drinking  water, \nwhich  is  usually  a  community  standpipe  (45%  of  households)  or  a  river  or  spring  (25%  of \nhouseholds).  Wood  and  coconut  shells  are  the  main  energy  source  for  cooking  for  90%  of \nhouseholds. Households spend 49% of their income on food\u2014mostly on rice, bread, flour, and \nnoodles,  as  89%  of  households  grow  their  own  vegetables.  Average  household  health \nexpenditures are less than $20 per year. \n\n42. \nThere is no system of unemployment insurance to cushion the impact of job losses. As \nfamilies cut back on food expenditures, the already high malnutrition rates for rural infants (20%) \nand young children aged 2\u20135 (40%) are likely to increase.30 An increased inability to pay school \nfees means that the secondary school graduation rate, which at 7% for girls is one of the lowest \nin the world, will fall further. The program will have a positive impact on the poor by (i) helping \nfarmers increase their yield and incomes, (ii) providing support to industries that are most affected \nby  the  pandemic  with  the  proviso  of  maintaining  employment  levels,  and  (iii)  creating  a  small \nemployment program targeting women and youth. \n\nGender. The program is categorized effective gender mainstreaming. It includes several \n43. \nproactive actions across all three outputs to support women with the immediate and medium-term \nimpacts  of  COVID-19.  The  health  response  to  COVID-19  ensures  that  (i)  150  frontline  health \nworkers (nurses and doctors), of whom 50% are women, will be trained on COVID-19 protocols \nand provided with appropriate personal protective equipment;  31 (ii) at least 750 women will be \ntrained  as  public  health  advocates  to  support  gender-responsive  COVID-19  public  health \nmessages across all provinces; (iii) GBV referral pathways are incorporated into health planning; \nand (iv) COVID-19 health facilities are safe and accessible for women and vulnerable populations.  \n \n44. \nIn addition, socioeconomic impacts on women will be addressed in several ways. First, to \naddress issues relating to reduction or loss of income should a COVID-19 outbreak occur, food \nrations will be distributed to 100,000 households throughout the country, including to about 10,000 \nhouseholds headed by women. Second, capital injections into SOEs that commit to retaining staff \nwill benefit women, who make up a large proportion of workers in companies such as SolTuna \n(56% of the workforce) and Solomon Airlines (36%). Third, women will be contracted to monitor \nprices, which will increase their income and ensure prices are affordable. Fourth, an agricultural \nsupport  program  will  be  developed,  which  will \nfarmers. \nThe development of the support will be informed by gender analysis and proactive measures will \nbe taken to set targets to ensure women farmers benefit. Fifth, the Development Bank of Solomon \nIslands will be provided with funds to make loans to MSMEs, including those owned by women. \nSixth, measures  will  be  introduced to  prevent  and  respond to  GBV,  including  nationwide  radio \npublic awareness campaigns on GBV and COVID-19, and the development of COVID-19 referral \npathways  and  COVID-19  telephone GBV  services  in  all  provinces.  Service  providers  will  have \nplans  in  place  that  will  allow  them  to  continue  to  provide  services  if  COVID-19  cases  are \nconfirmed. Finally, the Protection Committee and GBV subcommittee have been activated and \nare ensuring that gender issues and support for the rights of vulnerable populations are being \nconsidered  across  COVID-19  preparedness  and response  activities.  This  committee  has  been \nallocated  funding  of  SI$2.3  million  ($0.3  million).  The  gender  activities  and  outcomes  of  the \nprogram will be monitored using a gender monitoring matrix.32 \n \n\ninclude  support \n\nto  women \n\n \n\n30 Joelle  Albert  et  al.  2020.

ADB is providing \ntechnical assistance and policy advice to reform Solomon Islands\u2019 tax system, \nand is preparing a project to implement a new revenue management system. \nThe Economic Stimulus Package uses existing mechanisms where available. \nADB  and  other  development  partners  are  helping  the  government  develop \nimplementation plans associated with the government\u2019s program.  \n\nThe  government  has  been  working  to  strengthen  policy,  governance,  and \ninstitutional arrangements for disaster risk management, including adopting a \ndisaster management plan and setting up a climate and disaster finance unit in \nthe Ministry of Finance and Treasury. ADB is preparing a program to improve \ndisaster risk management and provide quick-disbursing funds in the event of a \ndisaster. \n\nADB = Asian Development Bank, COVID-19 = coronavirus disease. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n \n47. \nThe government has assured ADB that implementation of the program shall conform to \nall  applicable  ADB  policies  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures,  safeguards, \ngender,  procurement,  consulting  services,  and  disbursement as  described  in  detail  in  the  loan \nand grant agreements. \n \n\nV. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n \n48. \nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  loan  and  grant  would  comply  with  the  Articles  of \nAgreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve (i) the \nloan of $10,000,000 to Solomon Islands for the COVID-19 Rapid Response Program, from ADB\u2019s \nordinary capital resources, in concessional terms, with an interest charge at the rate of 1.0% per \nyear  during the  grace  period  and  1.5%  per  year  thereafter;  for  a term  of  24 years,  including  a \ngrace period of 8 years; and such other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance \nwith  those  set  forth  in  the  draft  loan  agreement  presented  to  the  Board;  and  (ii)  the  grant  not \nexceeding  $10,000,000  to  Solomon  Islands,  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources  (Asian \nDevelopment Fund), for the COVID-19 Rapid Response Program, on terms and conditions that \nare substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft grant agreement presented to the \nBoard. \n \n\n16 June 2020   \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nMasatsugu Asakawa \nPresident \n\n \n\n \n\n33 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n13 \n\n \n\n\f14 \n\nAppendix 1 \n\nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n\nCountry\u2019s Overarching Development Objectives \nResilient and environmentally sustainable development with effective disaster risk management, \nresponse, and recovery  \nAll Solomon Islanders have access to quality health care  \n(National Development Strategy, 2016\u20132035)a \n\nPerformance Indicators with \nTargets and Baselines \n\nData Sources and \nReporting \nMechanisms \n\nResults Chain \nEffect of the Program \n\n \n\nAdverse effects of \nCOVID-19 on \nbusinesses and the \npopulation reduced b \n\nOutputs \n\n \n\n1.

Adverse Impact of \n\nExogenous Shocks \n\nASSESSMENT OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE ACCESS CRITERIA FOR THE \nCOUNTERCYCLICAL SUPPORT FACILITY AND THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC RESPONSE \nOPTION \n\nAccess Criterion \n\nAsian Development Bank Assessment \n\nThere has been a sharp decline in growth and revenue forecasts for 2020 \nas a result of the pandemic. The final magnitude of the economic losses will \ndepend on how the outbreak evolves in both Solomon Islands and the rest \nof the world. For the past 5 years, growth in Solomon Islands has averaged \n2.5%  of  GDP.  With  the  onset  of  the  pandemic,  growth  is  projected  to \ncontract  from  between  0.2%  and  12.3%.  The  wide  range  of  projections \nreflect when the forecasts were made, the assumptions on trading partner \ngrowth, particularly the People\u2019s Republic of China, how long borders will \nstay closed in Solomon Islands and key neighbors like Australia and New \nZealand, and the underlying fragilities in the economy. The fiscal deficit is \nprojected to increase from 2.7% of GDP in 2019 to 7.3% of GDP in 2020. \nGovernment  external  public  debt  is  projected  to  increase  from  10.1%  of \nGDP  to  17.8%  in  2020.  The  current  account  deficit  will  increase  by  6.4 \npercentage  points  to  15%  of  GDP  in  2020.  Poverty,  as  measured  by  the \ninternational  poverty  line  of  $1.90  per  day,  is  expected  to  increase  from \n23.6%  of  the  population  in  2018  to  27.5%  in  2020.  The  economic \ndeterioration is a result of three primary causes: (i) lower exports, which are \nconcentrated \n(ii)  significant \ninfrastructure projects are stalled as skilled labor and raw materials cannot \nbe imported; and (iii) falling remittances as additional workers cannot travel \nto the key Australian and New Zealand markets.  \n\nlogging,  agriculture,  and \n\ntourism; \n\nin \n\nThe government has approved a SI$446 million ($54 million) countercyclical \ndevelopment  program  to  respond  to  the  crisis  consisting  of  two  major \ncomponents. The first component, costed at SI$137 million ($16.5 million), \nis  for  implementing  the  COVID-19  Preparedness  and  Response  Plan \nfocused on preventing the virus from entering the country and getting the \ncountry  ready  if  the  virus  enters,  particularly  the  health  sector.  The \npreparedness  and  response  plan  contains  an  initial  SI$27  million  ($2.5 \nmillion) for health, social protection measures including food rations for the \nentire population for a month, increased gender-based violence measures, \nand  more  supplies  to  schools  such  as  hand  sanitizer.  The  second \ncomponent,  costed  at  SI$309  million  ($37.5  million),  is  an  Economic \nStimulus  Package.  The  Economic  Stimulus  Package  includes  social \nprotection measures through support for farmers; the forestry, fisheries, and \ntourism sectors; grants to churches, provincial authorities, and schools; and \ncontracting women and youth to  monitor  prices. There is rental relief  and \nmore  credit  through  the  development  bank  for  micro,  small,  and  medium \nenterprises,  equity  injections  in  state-owned  enterprises,  and  bringing \nforward  infrastructure  projects.  The  Economic  Stimulus  Package  also \nprovides each Solomon Islands National Provident Fund member the ability \nto access SI$5,000. Banks are deferring loan repayments. Power tariffs and \nPort  Authority  charges  have  been  reduced.  And  the  furloughed  public \nservants will continue to receive full pay. \n\nThe government has a pre-shock record of generally sound macroeconomic \nmanagement, with low deficits. Economic growth was respectable at 3.9% \nand  2.7%  in  2018  and  2019,  respectively.  This  was  driven  by  strong \nperformance \nfisheries,  agriculture,  and \ninfrastructure, \nmanufacturing. Inflation was low at 1.9% in 2019. There was a fiscal surplus \nof 0.7% of GDP in 2018, but the fiscal deficit was manageable at 2.7% of \n\nlogging, \n\nin \n\n2.  Countercyclical \nDevelopment \nExpenditures \n\n3.

Although the current account deficit was 6.4% in 2019, there \nwere plenty of official reserves, with over 8 months of import cover. Public \nexternal debt levels were low\u2014rising from 7.5% of GDP in 2015 to 10.1% of \nGDP in 2019\u2014but were projected to double to 21.7% of GDP in 2024, which \nis  driven  by  the  government\u2019s  comprehensive  infrastructure  investment \nprogram, which would positively impact growth, particularly in rural areas. \n\nSolomon  Islands  has  zero  COVID-19  cases.  With  a  fragile  health  system \nwhich would quickly be overwhelmed if the virus arrived and spread rapidly, \nthe government implemented strong measures to prevent entry of the virus \nand prepare the country, particularly the health system, for an outbreak. A \nState  of  Emergency  was  declared  on  25  March  2020  and  extended  by \nParliament  for 4  months  to  25  July  2020.  International  passenger  flights \nwere  suspended  on  27  March.  On  26  February  2020,  the  government \napproved the COVID-19 Preparedness and Response Plan which aims to \nminimize  the  risk  of  importing  COVID-19  to  Solomon  Islands,  limit  the \nspread and impact of the disease if it enters the country, and reduce societal \ndisruption and social impacts of the pandemic. An initial SI$27 million ($2.5 \nmillion)  has  been  allocated  to  the  health  response.  Hospitals  are  being \nupgraded, particularly isolation units which could be used as intensive care \nunits;  medical  personnel  are  being  trained  on  infectious  disease  issues; \ntesting  equipment  and  medical  supplies  are  being  procured;  public \nawareness campaigns are underway. Development partners have provided \nfunding to supplement the government\u2019s efforts. \n\nAs result of the crisis, the public debt\u2013GDP ratio is now expected to increase \nfrom 10.1% of GDP in 2019 to 17.8% of GDP in 2020 and 31.8% of GDP in \n2024.  Persistent  budget  imbalances  and  an  ambitious  infrastructure \nconstruction program are expected to continue exerting significant upward \npressure  on  the  debt\u2013GDP  ratio,  even  after  the  impacts  of  the  pandemic \nhave  faded  and  economic  growth  has  recovered.  Debt  granted  on \nconcessional  terms  constitutes  80%  of  total  debt,  with  ADB  and  the \nInternational  Development  Association  as  the  major  creditors.  The  high \ndegree  of  concessional \nlow.  Debt \nsustainability  analyses  conducted  by  ADB  and  the  IMF  conclude  that \nSolomon Islands\u2019 public debt remains sustainable despite its rising trend and \nboth with or without the $10 million loan from this program. \n\nlending  keeps  borrowing  costs \n\nADB and the IMF collaborate closely on policy issues in Solomon Islands. \nADB  has  participated  in  IMF  Article  IV  missions.  The  two  organizations \nrecently  agreed  to  support  the  government  in  preparing  a  medium-term \nrevenue  strategy.  During  COVID-19,  ADB  and  the  IMF  have  had  regular \nbilateral  meetings  on  macro  and  fiscal  issues,  and  as  part  of  wider \ndevelopment partner discussions on supporting the government during this \ncrisis.  ADB,  as  lead  development  partner  supporting  the  government  in \npreparing the economic stimulus package, actively engaged with the IMF on \nthe design of the package to ensure their policy advice was reflected in the \nfinal document. The IMF approved a $28.8 million program on 1 June 2020, \nto be financed from its Rapid Credit Facility and Rapid Financing Instrument. \nADB  and  IMF  have  discussed  joint  monitoring  arrangements  from  our \nrespective  programs  where  feasible.  The  latest  IMF  Article  IV  report  was \nmade public in February 2020 and an IMF Assessment Letter was received \non 20 April 2020.  \n\nADB = Asian Development Bank, COVID-19 = coronavirus disease, GDP = gross domestic product, IMF = International \nMonetary Fund. \nSource: Asian Development Bank staff. \n\n \n\n\f", "author_pages": ["CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 3 June 2020) \n \n", "Currency unit \n \nSI$1.00 \n$1.00 \n \n", "\u2013 \n \n= \n= \n \n", "Solomon Islands dollar (SI$)  \n \n$0.1196 \nSI$8.3612      \n \n", "ABBREVIATIONS \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "Asian Development Bank \nCentral Bank of Solomon Islands \ncoronavirus disease  \nCOVID-19 Preparedness and Response Plan \nEconomic Stimulus Package \ngender-based violence \ngross domestic product \nInternational Monetary Fund \nMinistry of Finance and Treasury \nmicro, small, and medium-sized enterprise \nstate-owned enterprise \ntechnical assistance \nWorld Health Organization \n", "ADB \nCBSI \nCOVID-19 \nCPRP \nESP \nGBV \nGDP \nIMF \nMOFT \nMSME \nSOE \nTA \nWHO \n", " \n", "In this report, \u201c$\u201d refers to United States dollars, unless otherwise stated. \n", "NOTE \n", " \n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n", " \n", " \n", "Vice-President \nDirector General \nDirectors \n", "Ahmed M.
