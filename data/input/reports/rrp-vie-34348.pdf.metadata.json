The \nProject  does  not  support  new  civil  works  and  will  not  lead  to  an \nincrease in solid or liquid waste generation.  \n \nThe  Project  will  strengthen  the  preventive  health  system,  by \nincreasing  its  capacity  to  adapt  to  changing  epidemiological \npatterns. This will improve the health status of the population and \nsupport efforts to reach the health-related Viet Nam development \ngoals (VDGs). The Project will upgrade preventive health centers \nwith  new  equipment  and  training  in  46  provinces  and  4  national \ninstitutes.  This  will  support  the  preventive  health  system\u2019s  efforts \nto combat communicable diseases and build its capacity to meet \nnew challenges in areas such as food safety, occupational health, \nand  school  health.  Training  will  be  provided  in  preventive  health, \n(CDC),  and \nepidemiology,  communicable  disease  control \nlaboratory techniques. The Project will build capacity in the health \nsurveillance  system.  It  will  provide  support  to  CDC  programs  in \nthe  17  poorest  and  most  disadvantaged  of  the  project  provinces \n(project  priority  provinces).  The  Project  will  support  the  planning \nand technical capacity of the preventive health system and health \nsurveillance system.   \n \nViet Nam has achieved a high level of health due, in large part, to \ncontributions  from  its  preventive  health  system.  However  the \nsystem  was  designed \ntraditional \nto  meet \nepidemiological  profile,  dominated  by  communicable  diseases. \nThis  profile  is  changing  rapidly  as  a  result  of  growing  household \nincome,  urbanization,  and  better  access  to  health  care.  The \npreventive health system needs to change to better address these \n\nthe  country\u2019s \n\n\f \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \nImpact and Outcome \n\n \nCost Estimates \n\n \n\niii\n\nsupports \n\nchanges.  Some  parts  of  the  country  need  significant  new \ninvestment  in  emerging  health  areas,  such  as  food  safety  and \noccupational  health.  Other  parts  still  face  major  challenges  from \ntraditional communicable diseases. The preventive health system \nneeds to upgrade the knowledge and capacity of its staff. Building \ncapacity  in  the  health  surveillance  system  is  critical  given  its \nimportant  role  in  detecting  outbreaks  of  new  threats,  such  as \nsevere  acute  respiratory  syndrome  (SARS)  and  avian  flu,  and  in \nhelping  provinces  understand  their  epidemiological  profile  and \nplan accordingly.  \n \nThe  Project  is  closely  aligned  with  Viet  Nam\u2019s  Comprehensive \nPoverty  Reduction  and  Growth  Strategy  and  the  Health  Sector \nStrategy,  2001\u20132010  and  directly \nthe  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  commitment  to  reducing  poverty  and \nassisting  developing  member  countries  achieve  development \ngoals. The Project as a whole contributes directly to reducing the \nburden  of  communicable  diseases.  The  Project  focuses  on \nstrengthening  the  preventive  health  system  of  Viet  Nam,  which \nplays  a  leading  role  in  the  health  system\u2019s  efforts  to  combat \nfor  emerging \ncommunicable  diseases, \ncommunicable diseases such as SARS and avian flu.  \n \nA  $10,140,000  grant  will  support  various  activities  aimed  at \ncontrolling  communicable  diseases,  consistent  with  the  criteria \noutlined  in  the  Asian  Development  Fund  IX  grant  program  for \nHIV/AIDS  and  infectious  disease  control  activities.  The  Project \ncontributes  directly  to  reducing  the  burden  of  communicable  and \ninfectious  diseases,  as  the  preventive  health  system  plays  a \nleading \nto  combat \ncommunicable  diseases, \nincluding  emerging  communicable \ndiseases such as SARS and avian flu. \n \nThe  Project  will  improve  the  health  status  of  the  population, \nputting  Viet  Nam  on  course  to  achieve  the  health-related  VDG \ntargets  by  2015.  The  Project  will  support  Government \ndevelopment  of  a  comprehensive  preventive  health  system  that \nintegrates  the  reduction  of  major  communicable  diseases  and \naddresses  emerging  challenges, \nfood  safety  and \noccupational health.  \n \nThe total project cost, including physical and price contingencies, \nand taxes and duties, is $47.5 million equivalent.  \n \n\nthe  health  system\u2019s  efforts \n\nincluding  preparing \n\nincluding \n\nrole \n\nin \n\n \n\n\fiv \n\n \n\nFinancing Plan \n\n \nLoan and Grant \nAmounts and Terms \n\n \nPeriod of Utilization \n \nEstimated Project \nCompletion Date \n \nExecuting Agency \n \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\n \n\nCost Estimates \n($ million) \n\nTotal  \nCost \n27.9 \n10.1 \n9.5 \n47.5 \n\n \nPercent \n  59 \n  21 \n  20 \n100 \n\nLocal  \nCurrency \n2.1 \n8.9 \n9.5 \n20.4 \n\nForeign  \nExchange \n25.8 \n 1.3 \n 0.0 \n27.1 \n\n \nSource \nADB Loan \nADF Grant \nGovernment \nTotal \nADB = Asian Development Bank, ADF = Asian Development Fund. \nNote:  Numbers may not add up due to rounding. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nA  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to  Special  Drawing  Rights \n(SDR)19,222,000  ($27.9  million  equivalent)  will  be  provided  from \nADB\u2019s Special Funds resources.

A project management unit (PMU) headed by a \nproject  director  will  procure  and  distribute  all  major  equipment  to \nthe  implementing  agencies.  The  PMU  will  be  responsible  for \norganizing training activities and allocating resources, supervising \nsmall-scale  procurement  by  participating  provinces  and  national \ninstitutions, and liquidating project expenditures. A project steering \ncommittee will supervise PMU activities.  \n \nThe Project will be managed by the provincial health services and \nthe  national  institutes,  with  the  support  of  a  small  administrative \noffice  that  will  serve  as  the  project  implementation  unit.  The \nprovinces and national institutes will coordinate training and carry \nout  small-scale  procurement  to  ensure  that  the  Project  operates \nsmoothly. They will ensure that the equipment provided is properly \nused and maintained.  \n \n\n\fProcurement \n\n \nConsulting Services \n\n \nProject Benefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\n \n\n \n\nv\n\nGoods  and  services  will  be  procured  in  accordance  with  ADB \nGuidelines for Procurement. Laboratory equipment (15 packages) \nwill be procured on the basis of international competitive bidding, \ninternational  shopping,  and  local  competitive  bidding,  depending \non  the  size  and  nature  of  the  package.  Additional  material  and \nsupplies will be procured nationally using international competitive \nbidding,  international  shopping,  local  competitive  bidding,  and \ndirect  purchase,  depending  on  the  nature  of  the  package.  The \ninstitutes  will  carry  small-scale \nprovinces  and  national \nprocurement using local competitive bidding or direct purchase. \n \nThe  Project  will  contract  66  person-months  of  international \nconsulting  services  (4  consultants)  recruited  as  a  firm,  using \nquality-and  cost-based  selection \nin  accordance  with  ADB's \nGuidelines on the Use  of Consultants and 170 person-months of \ndomestic consultants (7 consultants), recruited in accordance with \nother arrangements satisfactory to ADB.  \n \nThe  Project  will  have  a  significant  impact  on  the  health  system \nand the health status of the population of Viet Nam. It will address \nissues of inequality in the health system by targeting assistance to \nprovinces  that  still  face  a  high  burden  of  communicable  disease. \nThe Project will support the Government as it addresses emerging \nhealth  issues  such  as  food  safety  and  occupational  health. \nThrough  its  focus  on  diseases  that  are  often  underfunded,  the \nProject  will  generate  significant  health  benefits  and  externalities, \nand  is  expected  to  reduce  the  total  burden  of  disease  (as \nmeasured in disability adjusted life years) by 17% in 2015. \n \nThe  Project  will  benefit \nthe  preventive  health  system  by \nstrengthening  the  health  surveillance  system,  four  key  national \ninstitutes,  and  provincial  preventive  health  centers  in  46  of  64 \nprovinces (with a total population of 58.7 million, about 75% of the \npopulation).  The  Project  offers  targeted  support  to  17  project \npriority provinces (with a total population of 14.8 million) to reduce \nthe high burden of communicable disease.  \n \nThe Project will provide important support to the Ministry of Health \nand to provinces to plan for the ongoing epidemiological transition \nand  build  capacity  in  preventive  health,  including  laboratories, \nhealth  surveillance,  and  epidemiology.  About  3,500  local  health \nworkers  will  receive  training  in  community  health.  Refresher  and \nintensive  courses  will  be  offered  to  2,500  staff  and  an  additional \n350 staff will receive postgraduate training.  \n \nThe expected economic internal rate of return of the Project, only \nconsidering  private  benefits  to  people  who  would  have  become \nsick without the Project, is at least 16%.  \n \n\n \n\n\fvi \n\n \n\nRisks and Assumptions \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n\ninternationally  and \n\nThe  Project  will  support  technologies  and  procedures  that  are \nunderstood \nin  Viet  Nam.  Only  minimal \ntechnical  risks  are  associated  with  the  Project.  The  Project  does \nnot  have  any  adverse  social  or  physical  impact.  Land  acquisition \nand resettlement are not required as no civil works are needed.  \n \nThe  Project  will  provide  support  to  national  targeted  programs \n(NTPs)  in  17  project  priority  provinces  (out  of  a  total  of  46 \nthese  programs  have  generally  been \nprovinces).  While \nsuccessful,  they  do  not  always  coordinate  with  the  rest  of  the \nhealth  system  as  they  focus  narrowly  on  one  health  issue.  The \nProject will work to support ongoing efforts to integrate NTPs into \nthe  health  system,  by  providing  training  in  the  management  of \ncommunicable  disease  programs  and  support  for  quality  of  care \nstandards.  \n \nThe  Project  will  supply  laboratory  equipment.  This  investment \nrequires  adequate  government  budget \nfor  operation  and \nmaintenance  to  ensure  that  the  equipment  does  not  deteriorate. \nThe  Project  will  carry  out  a  careful  assessment  of  each  province \nto  ensure  that  equipment  purchased  is  needed  (given  the \nprovince\u2019s  epidemiological  profile  and  the  current  availability  of \nusable equipment.  \n \nThe  Project  will  provide  substantial  and  needed  support  for \ntraining  and  NTPs.  This  could  result  in  the  Government  reducing \nits  own  contribution  to  these  programs,  thus  reducing  the  overall \neffectiveness of the Project\u2019s investments.  \n \nThe  Project  will  invest  in  the  human  resources  of  the  preventive \nhealth staff. Experience has shown that it is often difficult to attract \nand  retain  trained  personnel  in  the  preventive  health  system, \nparticularly  in  remote  areas.  The  Project  will  offer  specialized \ntraining that is specific to the needs of preventive health staff. This \nwill  make  training  opportunities  attractive  to  staff  who  seek  a \ncareer in the preventive health field.  \n\n\f \n\n\f \n\n \nA. \n \n\nI.  \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n \n1. \nI  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  report  and  recommendation  on  (i)  a  proposed \nloan,  and  (ii)  a  proposed  grant,  both  to  the  Socialist  Republic  of  Viet  Nam  for  the  Preventive \nHealth System Support Project. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n\nII.  \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n1. \n\nSector Background \n\n \nViet Nam has seen significant progress in improving the living and health standards of its \n2. \npopulation. As a result of rapid economic growth and targeted public investment, at the current \nrate of progress Viet Nam will achieve most of the health-related Viet Nam development goals \n(VDGs) by 2015.1 The child mortality rate fell from 44 per 1,000 live births in 1991 to 30 in 2001. \nThe maternal mortality rate decreased from about 200 per 100,000 live births in 1990 to about \n160 in 1999. Child malnutrition has dropped from 47% in 1992 to 38% in 1996 and 26% in 2001. \nViet Nam has made significant gains in the control of several communicable diseases including \nmalaria  and  tuberculosis  (TB),  reducing  the  share  of  communicable  disease  from  56%  of  the \ntotal burden of disease in 1976 to around 27% in 2002.2  \n \n3. \nThe  Preventive  Health  System.  The  preventive  health  system  is  central  to  the \nGovernment\u2019s  efforts  to  maintain  and  improve  public  health.  The  system  is  responsible  for \ntraditional activities such as immunization, and information, education, and communication (IEC) \non good health practices and activities such as disease control, food safety, and school health \nprograms; public health laboratories; and epidemiological surveillance systems. \n \nThe preventive health system traditionally played a leading role in the health sector and \n4. \nis  usually  credited  for  the  country\u2019s  success  in  achieving  good  health  results  with  a  limited \nbudget. However, as free markets take hold, much of the focus in the health sector has been on \ncurative care at the expense of the preventive health system. The Government has made major \ninvestments to improve service quality and reduce vulnerability due to the high burden of out-of-\npocket expenditures. Public spending has increased significantly, from around $2.90 per capita \nin 1993 to $7.60 in 2000; about two thirds has been spent on the curative health system.3 Viet \nNam  has  also  received  substantial  foreign  support  for  health,  also  focusing  on  curative  health \ncare and family planning. Support for preventive health has focused on a few diseases, namely \nHIV/AIDS,4 malaria, and TB (Appendix 2). \n \n5. \nThe health system faces formidable challenges. The country\u2019s health profile is becoming \nmore  heterogeneous.  Despite  progress  in  reducing  the  overall  burden  of  communicable \ndiseases, they still remain a major health concern in many areas of the country. The Red River \nDelta and the South East regions have the epidemiological profile of a middle-income country. \n\n                                                 \n1  The VDGs are the localized version of the Millennium Development Goals; they are generally more ambitious and \n\ninclude a number of additional targets.  \n\n2   The  Project  was  prepared  with  support  from  ADB.  2003.  Technical  Assistance  to  the  Socialist  Republic  of  Viet \n\nNam for the Strengthening of Preventive Health Services Project. Manila. (PPTA 4102-VIE). \n\n3  Estimates based on Knowles, J. et al. 2003. Making Health Care More Affordable for the Poor: Health Financing in \n\nViet Nam.  \n\n4  Human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immune deficiency syndrome. \n\n\f 2 \n\nHowever  many  provinces  (primarily  in  the  Central  Highlands,  North  East,  and  North  West \nregions)  still  have  traditional  epidemiological  patterns,  with  communicable  diseases  remaining \nthe principal public health risk. For example, in the northern provinces of Cao Bang, Dien Bien, \nand  Lai  Chau,  more  than  50%  of  the  burden  of  disease  is  due  to  communicable  diseases, \ncompared with the Red River Delta, where communicable diseases account for 10%. In addition \nto the gap in health status between rich and poor provinces, the gap in health between poor and \nnon-poor  households  is  growing.5  Many  of  the  gains  in  health  and  nutrition  have  benefited \nwealthier households largely or exclusively.  \n \n6. \nNoncommunicable  diseases  are  playing  a  growing  role  in  the  health  profile  of  the \ncountry.  These  include  cardiovascular  diseases  (stroke,  hypertension,  heart  failure),  diabetes, \nand  cancer.  Noncommunicable  diseases  now  account  for  around  70%  of  the  total  burden  of \ndisease. While they are largely influenced by lifestyle factors (such as diet, tobacco, and alcohol \nuse), the health system can play a role in disseminating information about prevention and in the \nearly detection of life-threatening problems.  \n \nDespite  Viet  Nam\u2019s  success  with  traditional  communicable  diseases,  the  country  faces \n7. \nsignificant  challenges  from  emerging  communicable  diseases.  If  unchecked,  these  diseases \ncould slow Viet Nam\u2019s economic growth and limit progress in meeting the VDGs. HIV/AIDS is a \ngrowing  concern,  with  an  estimated  240,000  cases  (almost  0.4%  of  the  population)  and  rapid \nincrease  in  new  cases,  which  has  been  doubling  every  2  years.  Severe  acute  respiratory \nsyndrome (SARS) severally affected the country in 2003 and left a heavy economic and human \ntoll.  Avian  flu  also  has  the  potential  to  become  a  major  health  and  economic  threat.  It  has \nalready  caused  significant  damage  to  the  country\u2019s  poultry  industry.  If  the  disease  begins  to \nspread among the human population, the health consequences could be severe. Food safety is \nanother emerging concern, because higher household income and a greater role of women in \nthe  workforce  have  led  to  an  increase  in  the  demand  for  processed  and  packaged  food. \nProcessed  foods  have  become  a  major  source  of  transmission  of  food-  and  water-borne \ndiseases  and  of  toxic  and  carcinogenic  substances.6  For  example,  a  survey  of  street  food  in \nHanoi found that 44% contained unapproved agents.  \n \n\n2. \n\nPreventive Health in Viet Nam \n\n \n8. \nThe  preventive  health  system  is  a  separate  entity  within  the  health  sector.  Within  the \nMinistry  of  Health  (MOH),  two  policy  units  (Department  of  Preventive  Medicine  and  HIV/AIDS \nControl  and  Department  of  Food  Administration)  are  responsible  for  the  management  and \nsupervision of preventive health activities. The preventive health system carries out countrywide \nactivities  through  national  targeted  programs  (NTPs)  and  national  institutes,  and  provincial \nactivities through the provincial preventive health centers (PHCs).  \n \nNational  Targeted  Programs.  The  Government  created  10  NTPs  to  address  major \n9. \nhealth  problems,7  particularly  in  poor  and  remote  provinces.  The  NTPs  allocate  resources  to \nprovinces based on needs, taking into account fiscal capacity and health conditions. Support is \nprovided for direct interventions (such as the provision of drugs and bed nets), IEC campaigns, \n\n                                                 \n5  Bhushan,  I.,  E.  Bloom,  N.

MOH/UNICEF: Hanoi, 8 May 2002.  \n\n7   NTPs exist for dengue fever, expanded program for immunization, food safety, goiter, HIV/AIDS, leprosy, malaria, \n\nmental health, nutrition, and TB. NTPs also operate in other sectors, such as education.  \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n3\n\nand specialized training. While the NTPs have proved effective,8 concerns exist that they may \nfracture  the  health  system  by  creating  incentives  to  focus  on  specific  diseases  rather  than \ntreating the population\u2019s health needs in a holistic manner.  \n \nThe  Public  Health  Surveillance  System.  A  public  health  surveillance  system  plays  a \n10. \ncentral  role  in  health  sector  planning,  providing  information  to  guide  managers  and  health \nworkers  on  disease  control.  Viet  Nam  has  a  surveillance  system  for  communicable  diseases \n(including food-borne related diseases) and some noncommunicable diseases, including those \nrelated  to  occupational safety  and  health.  However,  the  quality  and  timeliness  of  data  depend \ngreatly  on  the  separate  guidelines  and  protocols  for  different  diseases  and  the  varying  local \ncapacity. This can be confusing for local staff supporting several disease programs.  \n \nNational Institutes. Twelve institutes and 2 centers, under direct MOH control, provide \n11. \ntechnical  guidance,  surveillance,  and  supervision  for  preventive  health  activities.  The  national \ninstitutes  also  play  an  important  role  in  training  and  public  health  research.  This  includes  the \nNational Institute of Hygiene and Epidemiology, which serves as the central technical resource \ncenter  for  the  preventive  health  system;  a  number  of  regional  institutes  that  provide  technical \nsupport to a defined geographic area; and institutes that focus on specific health issues, such as \nmalaria or nutrition.  \n \nThe  Preventive  Health  Center.  In  the  provinces,  the  PHC  is  the  primary  institution \n12. \nproviding preventive health services. As part of the provincial health service, the PHC receives \ntechnical guidance from MOH. The preventive health laboratory, which is under the PHC, is the \nprovince\u2019s  primary  center  for  testing  biological  samples,  and  conducting  food  safety,  and \noccupational  safety  and  health  programs.  The  PHC  is  supported  by  a  provincial  IEC  center. \nSchool health programs include hygiene promotion and health education; environmental health \nin schools; and regular health, visual, and dental examinations for students. In the districts and \ncommunities,  preventive  health  activities  are  integrated  with  the  curative  health  system.  Each \ndistrict  has  a  preventive  health  team,  typically  with  5\u20137  technical  staff  and  a  small  laboratory. \nEach  commune  health  center  has  at  least  one  staff  focusing  on  preventive  health  activities, \nworking with other commune health staff and village health workers. \n \n Human Resources. On average, a PHC has about 50 staff, including those working on \n13. \noutreach  activities  and  in  the  laboratory.  While  the  number  of  staff  is  generally  adequate,  the \nquality  is  below  recommended  levels,  particularly  in  remote  and  rural  provinces.  Only  about \n15% have either basic or in-service training in epidemiology or public health. Likewise, few staff \nare  trained  in  emerging  areas  such  as  HIV/AIDS,  occupational  health,  and  food  safety.  For \nexample, on average, 2.4 staff are trained in food safety per PHC, which is about half of what is \nrecommended.  Because  preventive  health  staff  do  not  have  direct  contact  with  patients,  they \ncannot  supplement  their  incomes  with  fees.  The  Government  gives  staff  additional  incentives, \nparticularly for staff located in poor and remote provinces.  \n \nB. \n \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\n1. \n\nChallenges \n\n \n14. \nRenewing  the  Preventive  Health  System.  Viet  Nam  will  need  to  increase  its \ninvestment in the preventive health system to ensure the system has the necessary equipment, \nsupplies,  and  human  capacity  to  meet  new  challenges.  Traditionally  the  preventive  health \n                                                 \n8  Minford, M. 2004. A Review of National Targeted Programs in Vietnam. Hanoi. \n\n \n\n\f 4 \n\nsystem played the leading role in maintaining the high levels of health seen in Viet Nam, but in \nrecent years investment has been inadequate to meet the changing health needs.  \n \n15. \nChanging Epidemiological Patterns. While Viet Nam is seeing significant changes in \nits epidemiological pattern, the change in the burden of disease has not been felt equally across \nthe country (Appendix 3). The preventive health system was designed when the epidemiological \npattern  was  much  more  homogenous.  Viet  Nam  now  requires  a  system  that  can  continue  to \nsupport provinces with high levels of communicable diseases, while beginning to address new \nissues like occupational health and safety and noncommunicable diseases.  \n \n16. \nEmerging Communicable Diseases. Viet Nam is at risk from emerging communicable \ndiseases such as HIV/AIDS, SARS, and avian flu. There are fears that Viet Nam could be in the \ncenter  of  a  major  pandemic,  which  would  cause  significant  human  suffering  and  economic \ndislocation. The preventive health system has been slow to adapt to these new risks, and lacks \nboth the financial and human resources to respond efficiently.  \n \nFractured Public Health Surveillance System. The existing surveillance activities are \n17. \nlimited  by  the  separation  of  information  into  individual  diseases  or  programs.  This  limits  the \nability  to  provide  a  comprehensive  and  integrated  epidemiological  picture  of  communicable \ndiseases.  The  concept  of  surveillance  is  not  fully  understood  at  all  levels  of  the  preventive \nhealth system. The current structure is not flexible enough to accommodate emerging disease \nconcern, such as SARS and avian flu.  \n \n18. \nFood  Safety.  With  current  trends  in  income  growth  and  urbanization,  food  safety  will \nbecome an increasing problem. Exporters of raw and processed foods also require a stronger \nfood inspection system to certify their products. The recent outbreak of avian flu only highlights \nthe  relationship  between  food  and  human  health.  The  Government  has  responded  to  this \nconcern  by  approving  an  ordinance  on  food  safety  and  creating  the  Department  of  Food \nAdministration  in  MOH.9  Food  safety  testing  equipment  is  usually  basic  and  limited,  and  most \nstaff lack sufficient training.  \n \n19. \nUnderdeveloped  School  Health.  The  potential  is  high  for  school  health  programs  to \nbecome  an  important  early  contact  with  the  health  system  to  prevent  future  disability, \nparticularly  for  children  in  poor  and  rural  areas.  Despite  this,  the  school  health  program  is \nrelatively underdeveloped. Staff working in school health have limited equipment (for example, \nfor eye tests and dental examinations) and often only basic training.  \n \n20. \nOccupational Health and Safety. Industrialization and urbanization have increased the \nneed to improve safety standards in the workplace making occupational safety and health a new \narea  for  the  preventive  health  system.  This  includes  testing  the  workplace  for  toxic  materials \nand  identifying  simple,  cost-effective  interventions  that  can  reduce  on-the-job  accidents  and \ninjuries.  Only  a  few  provinces  have  developed  occupational  health  and  safety  programs,  and \neven then, have noticeable limitations in equipment and staff training.  \n \n \n \n\n                                                 \n9  The Asian Development  Bank and World  Health Organization  provided support to the Government to strengthen \nfood  safety  policy  through  technical  assistance  to  build  capacity  to  prevent  food-borne  diseases:  ADB.  2000. \nTechnical Assistance to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for the Capacity Building for Prevention of Food-Borne \nDiseases. Manila. (TA 3483-VIE). \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n5\n\n2. \n\nOpportunities \n\n \n21. \nThe  preventive  health  system  was  designed  to  meet  the  needs  of  a  relatively \nhomogenous  country  with  a  high  burden  of  communicable  diseases.  Laboratories  were \ngenerally given the same type and amount of equipment. As with many public services in Viet \nNam,  the  preventive  health  system  has  been  driven  traditionally  by  inputs  (the  aim  to  meet \nGovernment norms for staffing and training) than by outcomes and goals. National norms were \nestablished for training and were applied universally across the country.  \n \n22. \nAs  the  epidemiological  profile  changes  due  to  the  growing  household  income, \nurbanization, and better access to health care, the preventive health system needs to change as \nwell. Some parts of the country require new investment in emerging areas, such as food safety \nand occupational health. Other areas still face major challenges from traditional communicable \ndiseases.  In  addition  to  the  need  for  new  and  appropriate  equipment,  the  preventive  health \nsystem also needs to upgrade the knowledge and capacity of its staff. Recent outbreaks of new \nthreats  (such  as  avian  flu  and  SARS)  require  strengthening  the  health  surveillance  and \nlaboratory systems. The health surveillance system plays a critical role in detecting outbreaks of \nnew threats and in improving strategic planning. The laboratory system needs to be upgraded, \nand investments to upgrade the capacity of national laboratories consolidated.  \n \nThe Preventive Health Master Plan. To respond to these needs, MOH has developed \n23. \na master plan10 for the preventive health system. The plan defines the roles and responsibilities \nof  the  different  actors  in  the  subsector  (Appendix  4).  The  goal  is  to  meet  the  country\u2019s  future \npreventive  health  needs  by  improving  the  system\u2019s  organization  and  increasing  investment  in \nequipment  and  staff  training.  The  investment  plan  includes  renovating  physical  infrastructure, \nreplacing  equipment,  and  increasing  the  quality  of  human  resources  to  better  prepare  the \ncountry \nflu, \nnoncommunicable  health  issues,  and  food  safety.  The  master  plan  explicitly  recognizes  that \ndifferent provinces have different investment needs.  \n \n24. \nThe  Government  has  increasingly  focused  resources  on  the  curative  subsector,  which \nhas also attracted the best staff and the bulk of resources. The master plan identifies resource \nneeds  of  around  $250  million  from  2006\u20132010.  Much  of  this  will  be  met  from  planned \ngovernment  investment,  however  significant  gaps  remain.  Most  external  support  to  the \npreventive  health  subsector  has concentrated on  three  diseases\u2014HIV/AIDS,  malaria,  and  TB, \nwith  little  additional  support  going  to  other  health  priorities.  The  public  health  surveillance  and \nfood safety systems have received important technical assistance, but investment is needed for \ntraining  and  equipment  to  build  on  these  initial  investments,  given  the  growing  threat  of  new \ncommunicable diseases and lifestyle disease.  \n \n\nfor  emerging  health  problems,  such  as  HIV/AIDS,  SARS,  and  avian \n\n3. \n\nLessons Learned \n\n \n25. \nThe Asian Development Bank (ADB) has been active in the health sector in Viet Nam for \nmore  than  a  decade  and  has  two  ongoing  investment  projects.11  ADB  has  participated \n                                                 \n10  Ministry of Health. 2004.

The first project, \nthe Rural Health Project, was slow to implement due to lack of familiarity with ADB procedures \nand  poor  communication.  This  experience  is  common  in  other  sectors  where  ADB  is  active. \nHowever,  MOH  has  improved  its  capacity  to  manage  ADB  administrative  requirements  and \nintegrate  them  with  government  regulation.  ADB  has  also  learned  a  great  deal  about \ngovernment procedures and how to integrate them in project design and supervision. The timing \nof activities within projects should be realistic and take into account administrative requirements \nof  the  Government  for  necessary  approval.  Consultants  can  provide  useful  technical  and \nplanning  support  in  project  implementation.  Project  design  should  take  into  account  the \ndecentralized  nature  of  government  with  the  appropriate  division  of  labor  between  MOH  and \nlocal  authorities.  Corruption  is  a  challenge  in  Viet  Nam.  In  the  health  sector,  ADB  has  spent \nsignificant  time  reviewing  procurement  documents  to  ensure  improved  transparency  and  to \nreduce the risk that corruption will distort project implementation. With time, project performance \nhas improved in the health sector. \n \n27. \nThe Government dedicates considerable effort to develop strategies and master plans. \nADB  experience  is  that  these  strategies  should  be  taken  seriously  as  they  reflect  significant \nnational ownership. Projects should align their objectives to existing national objectives and take \nadvantage  of  the  important  consensus-building  process  that  goes  into  preparing  government \nstrategies. Reforms often take time to gain support in Viet Nam, but once good understanding \nand  consensus  are  developed,  the  Government  is  able  to  take  decisive  action.  Likewise, \ndevelopment partners need to follow the cues given by the Government.  \n \n \n\nIII.  \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\n \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nA. \n \n28. \nThe goal of the Project is to improve the health status of the population by maintaining \nthe pace of health improvements, putting Viet Nam on course to achieve the health-related VDG \ntargets  by  2015.  The  Project  will  support  Government  efforts  to  develop  a  comprehensive \npreventive health system that supports efforts to reduce the spread of communicable diseases \nand addresses emerging challenges in preventive health, including food safety and occupational \nhealth and safety.  \n \n29. \nThe  Project  covers  46  of  the  country\u2019s  64  provinces.  Eighteen  provinces  are  excluded \nfrom the scope because they have existing projects with significant components to strengthen \ntheir preventive health services.12 Of the 46 participating provinces, 17 poor and disadvantaged \nprovinces  (the  project  priority  provinces)  with  significant  health  needs  will  receive  priority \nattention.  These  provinces  were  selected  using  criteria  that  weigh  their  relative  poverty  (as \nmeasured by the provincial VDG rating) and a measure of their health needs.13 The provinces \n                                                 \n12 A World Bank project supports the preventive health system in the 13 provinces of the Mekong Delta region and an \nADB project supports five provinces of the Central Highlands. Both projects are being closely coordinated with this \nProject  and  with  the  preventive  health  master  plan.  This  will  ensure  that  the  entire  country  is  covered  by  an \nequivalent set of interventions.  \n\n13 These provinces are Bac Can, Binh Phuoc, Cao Bang, Dien Bien, Ha Giang, Hoa Binh, Lai Chau, Lao Can, Lang \nSon, Ninh Thuan, Quang Binh, Quang Nam, Quang Ngai, Quang Tri, Son La, Thanh Hoa, and Yen Bai. The total \npopulation of the 17 provinces is 14.8 million, of which 39% are ethnic minorities.  \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n7\n\nOutputs \n\nselected  have  difficulty  controlling  common  infectious  diseases.  They  are  also  the  most \ndisadvantaged in terms of socioeconomic development. The Project will provide support for four \nnational institutes to strengthen their role as regional reference laboratories.  \n \nB. \n \n30. \nThe project design is based on an extensive review of the needs and investment options \nto  support  the  preventive  health  system,  in  the  context  of  the  preventive  health  master  plan \n(footnote  13).  The  Project  was  developed  through  extensive  consultation  with  MOH,  national \ninstitutes,  provincial  health  services,  and  health  sector  development  partners.  The  technical \nscope of the Project is divided into the four components: health surveillance and priority health \nissues,  preventive  health  system  strengthening,  human  resource  development,  and  project \nmanagement. \n\n \n\n \n\n1. \n\nHealth Surveillance and Priority Health Issues  \n\n \n\na. \n\nThe Health Surveillance System \n\n31. \nThe  health  surveillance  system  is  the  primary  tool  for  providing  information  to  guide \nhealth  managers  and  staff  to  carry  out  their  responsibilities  effectively,  including  introducing \nlocal control measures and strategic planning. The Project will strengthen the capacity to collect \nand  utilize  epidemiological  data,  to  ensure  better  tracking  and  monitoring  of  public  health \nthreats.  This  will  be  achieved  by  developing  an  integrated  surveillance  system  and  supporting \nfield  visits.  The  Project  will  support  training  of  provincial  and  district  staff  to  allow  them  to \neffectively  report  on  disease  outbreaks.  The  Project  will  work  in  close  coordination  with  other \ninitiatives  to  strengthen  the  health  surveillance  system,  including  ongoing  initiatives  by  the \nAssociation  of  Southeast  Asian  Nations  (ASEAN)  and  the  World  Health  Organization  and  the \nproposed Regional Communicable Disease Control (CDC) Project.14 These initiatives focus on \nimproving the national capacity of the system and compliance with the new International Health \nRegulations  developed  by  the  World  Health  Organization  in  response  to  the  SARS  outbreak. \nThe Project will focus on strengthening provincial and district capacity for routine monitoring and \nreporting.  \n \n \n \n32.  MOH  will  develop  a  minimum  set  of  quality  standards  to  monitor  the  performance  of \nPHCs and to serve as benchmarks for the public health surveillance system. Traditionally, MOH \nhas  focused  on  inputs  (quantity  of  equipment  or  training  levels  of  staff)  compared  with  official \nnorms. These new standards will focus on outputs, such as the quality and frequency of testing, \nand planning and programming to meet the provinces\u2019 preventive health needs. The Project will \n(i) design a monitoring system for the collection and analysis of information on the performance \nof the preventive centers and (ii) provide technical support to upgrade areas of the PHC that do \nnot meet the required quality of service standards.  \n \n \n \n33.  Many  provinces  continue  to  have  difficulty  bringing  common  infectious  diseases  under \ncontrol.  These  provinces  are  also  the  most  disadvantaged  in  terms  of  socioeconomic \n\nSupport for Communicable Disease Control \n\nQuality of Services \n\nb. \n\nc. \n\n                                                 \n14 ADB  is  preparing  a  regional  project  focusing  on  strengthening  the  capacity  of  countries  in  the  Greater  Mekong \n\nsubregion to control regional outbreaks of communicable disease. \n\n \n\n\f 8 \n\ndevelopment  and  have  a  high  ethnic  minority  population.  The  Project  will  provide \ncomprehensive  support  through  the  existing  NTPs  in  17  project  priority  provinces  with  high \nburdens  of  disease  and  low  fiscal  capacity.  This  support  will  be  based  on  provincial  plans \ndeveloped  on  an  annual  basis  and  will  complement  activities  ordinarily  covered  by  the  NTPs. \nThe participating provinces will develop an annual proposal for financing, including support for \nbehavior  change  communication  activities,  increased  supervision  and  technical  support,  and \nmaterial support. Given the significant support available for HIV/AIDS, the Project will focus on \nother communicable diseases, such as dengue fever and Japanese encephalitis, and parasite \ncontrol and deworming. The Project may support activities to control TB and malaria. However, \nthe primary focus will be on other communicable diseases that have received significantly less \nsupport and pose a serious risk to the population\u2019s health.  \n \n\n2. \n\nPreventive Health Service  \n\n \n\na. \n\nSupport for the Provincial Preventive Health System \n\n \n \n \nThe Project will strengthen PHCs in 46 provinces. It will provide a basic package of level \n34. \n1 equipment and supplies to all covered PHCs.15 For level 2a and 2b laboratories, the Project \nwill  provide  additional  equipment  to  meet  their  specific  needs.  The  Project\u2019s  resources  will  be \nallocated  judiciously  to  help  support  PHCs  replace  old  equipment.  A  detailed  assessment  of \nquantity and quality of existing equipment (taking into account existing inventory  of equipment \nand  proximity  to  provincial  hospitals  and  other  facilities)  was  carried  out  during  project \npreparation. MOH will finalize this needs assessment for each PHC. Particular emphasis will be \ngiven  to  areas  with  little  or  no  existing  equipment.  Based  on  the  initial  needs  assessment, \naround  40%  of  support  will  be  for  equipment  in  the  area  of  food  safety.  Around  30%  of  the \nsupport will be for infectious disease control equipment to replace existing equipment with more \nmodern equipment. Equipment will also be allocated for school health, occupational health and \nsafety  programs,  and  the  detection and  diagnosis  of  lifestyle  and  noncommunicable  diseases. \nComplementary  training  will  be  offered  in  the  use  of  new  equipment  and  laboratory \nmanagement.  \n \n \n\nSupport for National Institutions \n\n \n\nb. \n \n\n35. \nThe  Project  will  provide  support to the  four  main  public  health  institutes  in  the country: \nNational Institute of Hygiene and Epidemiology in Hanoi, the Pasteur Institute of Nha Trang, the \nPasteur  Institute  of  Ho  Chi  Minh  City,  and  the  Central  Highlands  Institute  of  Hygiene  and \nEpidemiology  in  Buon  Ma  Thout.16  These  institutes  play  a  critical  role  in  providing  regional \nsupport  for  the  preventive  health  system.  The  Project  will  support  the  provision  of  additional \nequipment  and  supplies  to  improve  the  institutions\u2019  efficiency.  Each  institute  will  provide  an \nassessment  of  their  equipment  needs  following  national  norms;  the  initial  assessment  was \ncompleted  during  project  preparation.  This  equipment  will  strengthen  the  institutions\u2019  role  in \nCDC  as  regional  reference  laboratories.  Viet  Nam  does  not  currently  have  any  class  3 \nlaboratories,  although  several  national  institutes  have  class  3  equipment.  The  Project  will \n\n                                                 \n15  Level 1 includes equipment for routine testing of communicable disease. Levels 2a and 2b include equipment for \nlevel  1  plus  equipment  required  to  support  testing  for  needs  that  vary  by  province,  such  as  occupational  health, \nborder quarantine, food safety, emerging diseases, and other noncommunicable diseases.  \n\n16  The  Project  will  not  support  the  provincial  PHCs  in  the  central  highlands  as  these  receive  a  comparable  level  of \nsupport  from  the  Health  Care  in  the  Central  Highlands  Project:  ADB.  2003.

The  Project  will  support  in-service  training  in \npreventive  and  community  health  at  all  levels  and  postgraduate  training  to  strengthen  the \ntechnical and managerial capacity of staff.  \n \n \n \nThe  Project  will  support  postgraduate  training  in  key  areas  such  as  epidemiology, \n37. \ncommunicable  disease  control,  public  health,  health  system  management,  and  laboratory \nprocedures.  The  Project  will  support  (i)  postgraduate  degrees  in  public  health  or  laboratory \nprocedures;  (ii)  postgraduate  training  for  a  master  of  public  health  (or  equivalent)  at  foreign \nuniversities  with  specialization  in  epidemiology  or  planning  and  management  for  CDC;  (iii) \npostgraduate certificate programs, including specialization in public health for medical doctors; \nand (iv) establishment of a field epidemiology training program, which will play a vital role in the \nsurveillance system in rapidly detecting and responding to new outbreaks; the Project will work \nclosely with other efforts to ensure an effective program. Approximately 350 staff will participate, \nwith  approximately  50  receiving  master\u2019s  or  equivalent  specialist  II  degrees  and  the  rest \nreceiving  postgraduate  certificates.  These  courses  will  be  held  primarily  at  major  medical \nuniversities.  Eight  preventive  health  staff  will  receive  training  in  foreign  universities  to  gain \ninternational  expertise  on  recent  advances  in  preventive  health  systems.  The  Project  will \ndevelop an annual training plan, which identifies postgraduate courses covered during the year. \nThis will give the training program flexibility to adjust to the country\u2019s changing needs.  \n \n \n \n38. \nThe Project will support technical training in environmental health, food safety, infectious \ndisease control, medical waste management, occupational health, and school health in medical \nschools,  universities,  and  national  institutions.  The  training  is  aimed  at  laboratory  and  other \ntechnicians working at the provincial, district, and commune levels. It will also be open to staff in \nheath  institutions  that  contribute  to  the  preventive  health  system,  such  as  the  staff  of  IEC \ncenters.  The  Project  will  support  refresher  courses,  from  1  to  2  weeks  duration,  to  update \nknowledge. It will also support longer, more comprehensive training courses in the same areas, \nfrom 1 to 2 months. In total, approximately 2,500 people will receive training.  \n \n \n \n39. \nThe  Project  will  support  the  training  of  commune  and  district  preventive  health  staff  in \nthe  17  project  priority  provinces  with  special  courses  designed  to  address  preventive  health \nneeds of poor and ethnic minority communities. The Project will support two training activities: \n(i) training in the preventive health needs of women and children, focusing on maternal mortality \nreduction,  CDC  in  children,  and  child  nutrition;  and  (ii)  training  in  local  CDC,  focusing  on \ninfectious  disease  control,  food  safety,  and  immunization  and  vaccination  management.  The \ntraining courses will be offered annually to selected staff. The training courses will be around 2 \n\nCommunity Health Training \n\nTechnical Training \n\nb. \n\nc. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f 10 \n\nweeks  in  length  and  be  designed  in  close  consultation  with  the  community.17  Approximately \n1,750 health workers will participate in each of these activities.  \n \n\n4. \n\nProject Management  \n\nADF IX Grant Component \n\n \n40. \nThe Project will help strengthen the central and provincial capacity of MOH to implement \nthe  Project.  The  Project  will  finance  the  necessary  office  equipment  and  supplies  to  support \nproject implementation. The Project will also support contract staff services (administrative and \nsupport  personnel)  required  for  effective  implementation,  monitoring,  and  evaluation  of  project \nactivities.  A  consulting  group  will  be  contracted  to  assist  MOH  in  procuring  equipment, \ndeveloping  field  epidemiology  and  other  training,  strengthening  the  surveillance  system, \nstrengthening  support  to  communicable  disease  programs,  and  ensuring  compliance  with \nGovernment and ADB guidelines.  \n \nC. \n \nA  $10,140,000  grant  will  support  various  activities  aimed  at  controlling  communicable \n41. \ndiseases, consistent with the criteria outlined in the Asian Development Fund IX grant program \nfor HIV/AIDS and infectious disease control activities. Appendix 5 provides details of the grant \ncomponent.  Grant  financing  is  justified  at  both  the  country  and  project  levels.  The  Project  is \nclosely aligned with Viet Nam\u2019s Comprehensive Poverty Reduction and Growth Strategy and the \nHealth Sector Strategy, 2001\u20132010, and directly supports ADB commitment to reducing poverty \nand assisting Viet Nam in achieving the VDGs.  \n \nThe Project contributes directly to reducing the burden of communicable and infectious \n42. \ndiseases, as the preventive health system plays a leading role in the health system\u2019s efforts to \ncombat  communicable  diseases,  including  emerging  communicable  diseases  such  as  SARS \nand avian flu. Distinctive activities that will be supported by the grant are in two components: (i) \nhealth surveillance and priority health issues, which will support the health surveillance system \nand provide targeted support to 17 project priority provinces to strengthen their CDC programs; \nand  (ii)  human  resource  development,  which  includes  significant  support  for  training  in \nepidemiology, disease surveillance and response, and management of communicable diseases. \nIt also includes training to address community health needs.  \n \nD. \n \n\nSpecial Features \n\n1. \n\nRenewed Focus on Health Problems of the Poor  \n\n \n43. \nThe Project disproportionately focuses on diseases of the poor, which are often ignored. \nMuch  of  the  training  focuses  on  the  health  needs  of  the  poor,  with  a  strong  emphasis  on \ncommunicable  diseases,  particularly  on  communicable  diseases  that  have  received  little \nattention  by  international  development  partners.  Health  training  will  target  community  health \nworkers in poor provinces. The support to NTPs also strengthens the health system\u2019s capacity \nto respond to health problems that burden the poor. Improving the preventive health system will \nreduce  the  vulnerability  of  the  poor  and  the  near  poor  to  health-related  shocks.  Appendix  6 \ncontains the summary poverty reduction and social strategy.  \n \n\n                                                 \n17 The  Project  will  utilize  existing  relevant  training  materials  and  courses,  such  as  those  developed  by  the  ADB-\nfinanced  Rural  Health  Project  (footnote  14)  and  similar  projects.  These  courses  will  be  developed  and  offered  in \ncollaboration with women\u2019s unions and other women\u2019s groups. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n11\n\n2. \n\nContribution to Medical Waste Management  \n\nless  hazardous  waste.  The  Project  will \n\nThe  Project  will  make  a  substantial  contribution \n\n \n44. \nimproving  medical  waste \nmanagement. The Project will replace outdated laboratory equipment with new equipment that \nimprove  current  health-care  waste \nproduces \nmanagement practices in national institutes and PHCs by providing refresher courses in medical \nwaste management, safety equipment for health-care workers, and equipment for proper waste \nmanagement.  It  will  also  supply  basic  equipment  necessary  for  improved  medical  waste \nmanagement. Appendix 7 contains the summary initial environmental examination.  \n \n\nto \n\n3. \n\nCoordination and Ownership \n\n \nThe Government has identified increased investment in the preventive health system as \n45. \nits  highest  priority  for  the  health  sector.  The  Project  was  developed  in  close  cooperation  with \nMOH to ensure consistency with the preventive health master plan (footnote 13). In particular, \nthe  project  design  incorporates  the  priorities  in  the  master  plan  and  integrates  these  priorities \nwith  ADB\u2019s  overarching  objective  of  poverty  reduction.  Prepared  in  close  consultation  with \nstakeholders,  the  Project  incorporates  their  comments  and  recommendations,  including  those \nreceived  in  stakeholder  workshops  and  from  numerous  field  visits.  Because  of  the  technical \nnature of preventive health, most interested stakeholders are active in the health sector.  \n \n46. \nThe  Project  was  developed  in  close  coordination  with  the  proposed  regional  CDC \nproject,  which  will  support  regional efforts  in  the  Greater  Mekong  subregion.  The  CDC  project \nwill  focus  on  strengthening  the  health  surveillance  system\u2019s  capacity  to  detect  and  respond  to \nthe  cross-border  transmission  of  disease.  In  particular,  this  will  support  implementation  of  the \nnew  international  health  regulations  on  the  early  reporting  of  communicable  diseases.  It \ncomplements  the  Project\u2019s  support  for  routine  monitoring  activities  of  provincial  health \nsurveillance system activities. The CDC project will provide support to controlling communicable \ndiseases  in  15  provinces,  which  will  complement  the  Project\u2019s  support  for  NTPs.  Several \ndisease control programs in the CDC project are not generally supported by NTPs.  \n \n\n4. \n\nContribution to Social Development \n\n \n47. \nThe  Project  focuses  on  improving  the  health  status  of  vulnerable  groups.  Ethnic \nminorities account for about 14% of Viet Nam\u2019s total population and 28% of the poor. They are \ndisproportionately affected by communicable diseases. The Project provides a special focus for \n17  project  priority  provinces  with  high  ethnic  minority  population  (39%  of  the  total  population). \nTraining  and  behavior  change  communication  activities  will  take  into  account  the  cultural  and \nlinguistic needs of ethnic minorities. Qualified ethnic minority health workers will be encouraged \nto participate in training. The strengthened surveillance system will allow better disaggregation \nof health problems by ethnicity. Appendix 8 contains the summary ethnic minority development \nplan.  \n \n48. \nThe Project mainstreams gender concerns to ensure that women share proportionately \nin the project benefits. The Project will strengthen the capacity of the preventive health system \nto better respond to the preventive health needs of both men and women. The preventive health \nsystem has a large number of women staff (around 55% of employees at the PHC are women) \nand  increasing  training  opportunities  will  enhance  the  status  of  this  work.  Equal  training \nopportunities  will  be  offered  and  qualified  women  will  be  encouraged  to  apply.  Some  of  the \ntraining  courses  will  focus  on  maternal  and  child  health  and  the  preventive  health  needs  of \n\n \n\n\f 12 \n\nCost Estimates \n\nwomen. These will be developed and offered in collaboration with the Women\u2019s Union and other \ngroups. Appendix 9 provides the Project\u2019s gender strategy.  \n \nE. \n \n49. \nThe Project is estimated to cost $47.5 million equivalent (Table 1). Of this, $27.1 million \nequivalent  (57%)  is  foreign  exchange  costs  and  $20.4  million  equivalent  (43%)  local  currency \ncosts.

The  loan  will  have  a  32-year \nterm,  including  a  grace  period  of  8  years,  and  an  interest  rate  of  1.0%  per  annum  during  the \ngrace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter. The loan will finance $25.8 million of the foreign \nexchange  cost  (including  interest  on  the  loan) and  $2.1  million  of  the  local  currency  cost.  The \ngrant will finance $1.3 million of the foreign exchange cost and $8.9 million of the local currency \ncost.  The  Government  will  provide  counterpart  funds  of  $9.5  million  equivalent  for  taxes, \nrecurrent costs, and part of the capital cost.

Strengthening and reorganizing Viet Nam\u2019s preventive health system is a major priority \ngiven both the risk of emerging health threats and the need to effectively address the changing \nand unequal epidemiological pattern. Viet Nam needs a large investment program to meet this \nchallenge. While the Government  has committed additional resources to the preventive health \nsystem,  these  will  not  be  sufficient  to  meet  the  required  investment  needs  without  external \nfinancing. Health systems require significant local currency expenditure and external support for \nlocal  currency  expenditures  is  justified  to  help  meet  this  gap.  A  higher  percentage  of  local \nfinancing for this Project is consistent with ADB policy. \n \n52. \nAlthough  no  cofinancing  is  envisioned  at  this  time,  cofinancing  from  both  public  and \ncommercial  sources  may  be  mobilized  in  the  future  to  complement  ADB  financing  for  the \nProject. Such cofinancing may include both grants and loans and may benefit from ADB credit \nenhancements,  including  ADB  guarantee  instruments.  Cofinancing  arrangements  will  be \npresented  for  Government  and  ADB  consideration  as  necessary.  The  Government  has \ncommitted  to  providing  counterpart  funds  promptly  to  ensure  early  implementation  of  the \nProject.  \n \nG. \n \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n1. \n\nProject Management \n\n \n53.  MOH  will  be  the  Executing  Agency.  A  project  management  unit  (PMU),  located  within \nMOH,  will  work  under  the  overall  guidance  of  a  project  steering  committee.18  The  steering \ncommittee  will  (i)  provide  guidance  to  ensure  timely  and  effective  performance  of  the  Project, \nand  (ii)  supervise  strategic  planning  and  propose  modifications  and  changes  to  the  Project. \nAppendix 11 outlines the project management and implementation structure.  \n \nThe PMU will coordinate national and provincial project activities, and serve as a liaison \n54. \nbetween the provinces, MOH, and ADB. A project director will head the PMU with the support of \na  vice  director  and  at  least  five  full-time  project  staff  to  provide  technical  expertise  and \nadministrative  support  in  the  areas  of  accounting,  contract  administration.  disbursement, \nplanning, and procurement. \n \n\n                                                 \n18  Decision 4115/Q\u2015BYT of November, 2004 establishes a project steering committee for all ADB-financed projects \nwithin  MOH,  with  representatives  from  MOH  and  other  key  government  department.  The  steering  committee  is \nchaired by a vice minister. MOH has indicated that the existing PMU for the Health Care in the Central Highlands \nProject will be the PMU.  \n\n \n\n\f 14 \n\n55.  MOH will contract a consulting group to support the planning and administration of the \nProject.  The  consulting  group  will  support  the  PMU  in  (i)  planning  and  preparing  procurement \ndocuments;  (ii)  developing  monitoring  indicators;  and  (iii)  meeting  ADB  guidelines  for \nprocurement and project implementation; as well as provide technical assistance in the design \nand  implementation  of  the  health  surveillance  system  and  quality  of  services,  and  support \nefforts to combat priority communicable diseases. \n \n56.  \nThe provincial health services, through the provincial preventive health departments, will \nadminister the Project. To support the administration, the provinces will establish a small project \nimplementation  unit  (PIU)  and  will  contract  at  least  one  contracted  staff  and  an  administrative \nassistant.  The  PIU  will  coordinate  with  the  PMU  on  specific  equipment  and  training \nrequirements of the province. The Project will coordinate with the national institutes in the same \nfashion.  \n \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Schedule \n\n \nThe  Project  will  be  implemented  over  6  years  from  January  2005  to  December  2011. \n57. \nProcurement  of  major  equipment  will  take  place  in  the  second  and  third  years.  Appendix  12 \npresents the implementation schedule.  \n \n\n3. \n\nProcurement \n\n \n58. \nAll  ADB-financed  procurement  will  be  in  accordance  with  ADB  Guidelines  for \nProcurement. Procurement of equipment and supplies will use international competitive bidding \nprocedures  if  the  package  amount  exceeds  $1  million,  international  shopping  or  local \ncompetitive bidding procedures if $1 million or less, or direct purchase for less than $100,000. \nLocal  competitive  bidding  may  be  used  with  procedures  acceptable  to  ADB  for  supply  and \ninstallation  contracts.  The  PMU  will  handle  all  procurement  using  international  competitive \nbidding, local competitive bidding, and international shopping. Direct purchase may be used by \nthe  provinces  and  national  institutes,  under  the  supervision  of  the  PMU.  The  Project  does  not \nsupport civil works. Appendix 13 contains a list of indicative procurement packages.  \n \n\n4. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n \n59. \nThe  Project  will  require  66  person-months  of  international  consulting  services  and  170 \nperson-months of domestic consulting services. The international consultants will be recruited in \na single package from a consulting firm, using ADB quality- and cost-based selection through a \nfull  technical  proposal  in  accordance  with  ADB  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants.  Four \ninternational  and  seven  domestic  consultants  will  be  contracted.  The  Government  has \nrequested  that  the  international  consultants  work  closely  as  an  integrated  team  with  the \ndomestic consultants to be recruited as a firm or individually as appropriate, in accordance with \nother arrangements satisfactory to ADB. Appendix 14 summarizes consulting services.  \n \n\n5. \n\nTraining \n\n \n60. \nThe  Project  will  finance  degree  courses  and  refresher  courses  for  staff  working  in  the \npreventive health system. The PMU, with support from the Department of Science and Training \n(DST),  will  coordinate  training  activities,  including  making  contracts  and  other  arrangements \nwith  universities  and  training  centers.  DST  and  the  Project  will  evaluate  the  quality  and \navailability  of  preventive  health  courses.  Much  of  the  training  is  expected  to  be  carried  out \nthrough  existing  programs  at  medical  universities,  secondary  medical  schools,  and  other \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n15\n\ntraining  institutions.  DST  will  work  with  the  training  institutes  to  develop  and  revise  curricula \nwhen  necessary.  To  ensure  that  training  opportunities  are  open  to  all  qualified  applicants, \nregardless  of  gender  and  ethnicity,  DST  will  develop  a  set  of  transparent  criteria  for  the \nselection of trainees at all levels. The provinces and national institutes will identify trainees and \ncoordinate  training  activities  under  their  jurisdiction.  Selection  for  international  training  and  for \nsome postgraduate training will be conducted at the national level. Trainees will be required to \nsign  guarantees  to  return  to  host  institutions  for  at  least  2  years  after  receiving  training. \nAppendix 15 outlines the proposed training activities.  \n \n\n6. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n \n61. \nThe PMU will use ADB imprest account procedures for eligible project expenditures. An \nimprest  account  for  the  loan  will  be  established  by  PMU  at  a  commercial  bank,  acceptable  to \nADB within 1 month of loan effectiveness. The account will have a ceiling of $2 million; the initial \ndeposit will be based on estimated expenditures for the first 6 months of project implementation \nor $1 million, whichever is lower. A separate imprest account will be established for the Asian \nDevelopment Fund grant. The initial deposit to the imprest account will be based on estimated \nexpenditures for the first 6 months of the Project or $1,000,000, see Grant Agreement Section \n3,  whichever  is  lower.  The  imprest  accounts  will  be  established,  managed,  replenished,  and \nliquidated in accordance with the ADB Loan Disbursement Handbook, as amended from time to \ntime,  and  detailed  arrangements  agreed  upon  by  the  Government  and  ADB.  Statement  of \nexpenditure  procedures  will  be  used  for  reimbursing  eligible  expenditures  and  liquidating \nadvances  to  the  imprest  accounts  to  ensure  speedy  project  implementation.  The  maximum \npayment for any individual item using statement of expenditure is $100,000 per payment.  \n\n62. \nTo  expedite  fund  flows  to  the  provinces  and  national  institutes,  each  province  and \nnational institute may establish a second generation imprest account (SGIA) within 3 months, in \nUS dollars for the grant proceeds or local equivalent for the loan proceeds, at commercial banks \nacceptable  to  ADB.  The  PMU  will  transfer  funds  from  the  imprest  accounts  to  the  SGIA  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook and detailed arrangements agreed upon \nby the Government and ADB. The initial amount to be deposited into each of the SGIAs will not \nexceed the equivalent of 6 months estimated expenditures or $10,000, whichever is lower. The \nceiling for these SGIAs will not exceed $20,000.  \n\n7. \n\nFinancial Management, Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n \nFinancial Management. This is ADB's third project with MOH. A financial management \n63. \nand governance assessment was prepared for the Health Care in the Central Highlands (HICH) \nProject (prepared in July 2003), which has a similar project design. MOH has shown that it has \nthe  financial  management  capacity  to  manage  a  large,  externally  financed  project.  It  has \nmaintained  a  number  of  first  and  second  generation  imprest  accounts  and  has  submitted \nrequired  audits  in  a  timely  fashion.  MOH  is  proposing  that  the  PMU  responsible  for  the  HICH \nproject  also  administer  this  Project.  The  HICH  project  also  has  both  grant  and  loan  elements \nthat  are  separately  financed  and  require  separate  audits  and  financial  management  controls. \nMOH  reviewed  the  financial  management  assessment  and  confirmed  that  it  is  still  valid  as  no \nmajor changes have been made to Government or MOH financial management policies. Based \non  ADB  experience  with  MOH  and  findings  of  the  financial  management  and  governance \nassessment, the financial management arrangements appear appropriate.  \n \n64. \nAccounts and Auditing. The Government, acting through MOH, will maintain adequate \nrecords and accounts to identify goods and services financed by the Project. The PMU  will (i) \n\n \n\n\f 16 \n\nkeep  project  accounts  separate  from  regular  accounts;  (ii)  maintain  separate  accounts  for  the \nloan and grant portions of the Project; (iii) ensure accounts and financial statements are audited \nannually  in  a  timely  fashion,  in  accordance  with  sound  accounting  principles,  by  external \nauditors acceptable to ADB; and (iv) submit to ADB, not later than 6 months after the close of \neach  fiscal  year,  certified  copies  of  audited  project  accounts,  including  the  imprest  accounts, \nstatement  of  expenditure,  and  financial  statements;  the  auditor\u2019s  reports  and  opinions;  and \nmanagement  letter  together  with  a  report  of  actions  taken  by  MOH  to  improve  the  financial \nmanagement system. The Project will finance the cost of auditing.19 \n \n65. \nAnticorruption.  MOH  has  been  briefed  on  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  and  on  the \nimportance that the Government and ADB place on eliminating corruption. Attention was drawn \nto the section on fraud and corruption that was added to ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement and \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants, particularly the need for bidders, suppliers, contractors, \nand  consultants  to  observe  the  highest  standards  of  ethnics  in  procuring  and  executing  ADB-\nfinanced contracts, and the sanctions if fraud and corruption are discovered. The Project design \nhas provisions for funds for independent and external auditors. \n \n\n8. \n\nAdvance Action \n\n \n66.  MOH  will  take  advance  procurement  action  to  expedite  project  implementation \nparticularly  for  office  equipment  and  supplies  for  the  PMU.  Following  standard  ADB  practices, \nMOH will take advance recruitment action to ensure that the consulting group is mobilized in a \ntimely  fashion.  ADB  concurrence  to  advance  action  does  not  commit  ADB  to  finance  related \nexpenditure under the Project or to finance the Project.  \n \n\n9. \n\nReporting \n\n \n67. \nPrior to loan effectiveness, MOH  will submit short monthly progress  reports to ADB on \nprogress  toward  effectiveness.  After  the  Project  becomes  effective,  MOH  will  prepare  a \nquarterly progress report summarizing (i) progress made against established targets; (ii) delays \nand  problems  encountered,  and  actions  taken  to  resolve  issues;  (iii)  compliance  with  loan \ncovenants;  (iv)  proposed  program  of  activities  to  be  undertaken  during  the  next  6  months;  (v) \nexpected progress during the succeeding period; and (vi) status of participating provinces and \ninstitutions. Within 3 months of physical completion of the Project, the Government will prepare \nand submit a project completion report to ADB. \n \n\n10. \n\nProject Review  \n\n \n68. \nThe Government and ADB will conduct periodic reviews of the Project to ensure smooth \nimplementation. The Government and ADB will jointly undertake a midterm review after 3 years \nof  physical  implementation.  The  midterm  review  will  (i)  review  the  Project\u2019s  scope,  design, \nimplementation  arrangements,  and  other  relevant  issues;  (ii)  examine  progress  toward  the \nProject\u2019s  objectives;  (iii)  identify  changes  in  resource  allocation  and  their  impact  on  project \nimplementation and sustainability; (iv) assess implementation performance against projections; \n(v)  review  compliance  with  loan  covenants;  (vi)  identify  problems  and  constraints;  and  (vii) \nformulate appropriate recommendations for corrective action.  \n\n                                                 \n19 September 2002.

MOH  has  identified  a  shortlist  of  verifiable  indicators  for \nmonitoring  and  evaluation  that  are  incorporated  in  the  design  and  monitoring  framework \n(Appendix  1).  The  PMU  will  work  with  the  Department  of  Preventive  Medicine  and  HIV/AIDS \nControl  to  ensure  that  data  is  collected,  analyzed,  and  disseminated  to  all  interested  parties. \nIntermediate  results  will  be  monitored  and  evaluated  using  the  routine  information  system.  An \nend  of  project  survey  will  assess  the  Project\u2019s  overall  impact  and  benefits.  Data  will  be \ndisaggregated by gender and ethnicity.  \n \n\nIV.  \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n\nBenefits and Impacts \n\n \nA. \n \n70.  More Responsive Preventive Health System. The Project will help Viet Nam respond \nbetter  to  the  epidemiological  transition.  As  the  burden  of  disease  changes,  PHCs  will  need  to \nadapt  to  and  address  new  health  challenges,  including  those  related  to  food  safety, \noccupational and environmental health, and noncommunicable diseases.  \n \n71. \nImproved Health Status. The Project will improve the health status of the population in \nthe  participating  provinces,  leading  to  a  measurable  decrease  in  the  burden  of  communicable \ndisease.  The  general  population  will  benefit  due  to  the  preventive  health  system\u2019s  improved \ncapacity  to  monitor  food  and  environmental  quality.  The  Project  will  also  benefit  a  number  of \nspecific  groups,  including  school  children  through  improved  school  health  programs  and \nmothers through community health training. The population in 17 project priority provinces with \nhigh incidence of communicable diseases will benefit from the Project\u2019s focus on strengthening \nCDC  programs.  Using  disability  adjusted  life  years  (DALY),  a  commonly  used  measure  of  the \nburden of disease, the Project is expected to save about 2.0 million DALYs. This represents an \nincrease in life expectancy of around 1\u20132% for the entire population.  \n \nSignificant Economic Benefits. Investing in health, especially the public good aspects \n72. \nof  health,  brings  significant  economic  benefits  to  the  country.  Viet  Nam\u2019s  recent  experiences \nwith  SARS  and  avian  flu  have  shown  that  communicable  diseases  can  lead  to  significant \neconomic  damage.  The  Project  will  increase  the  capacity  to  respond  to  these  health \nemergencies  and  reduce  their  economic  cost.  The  private  benefits  of  the  Project,  from  the \nreduction of DALYs, give the Project at least a 16% economic internal rate of return. Appendix \n16 summarizes the expected economic benefits of the Project. \n  \nReduced  Poverty.  Poor  health  is  a  leading  cause  of  poverty  in  Viet  Nam.  Many \n73. \nhouseholds  are  forced  to  drain  their  savings  to  pay  for  expensive  medical  bills,  in  addition  to \nloosing  the  income  from  sick  family  members  who  are  unable  to  work.  Thus  well-targeted \ninvestment can improve equity and efficiency within the economy. The preventive health system \nin  Viet  Nam  plays  an  important  role  in  protecting  the  health  of  the  poor.  The  poor  have  less \naccess  to  public  and  private  preventive  health  services  and  have  higher  burdens  of  disease; \nthus they will benefit the most from increased public provision of preventive health services. The \nProject targets the most disadvantaged provinces and the poverty analysis shows that at least \n38%  of  the  Project\u2019s  benefits  will  accrue  to  the  poor.  The  Project  will  benefit  nearly  15  million \npeople living in the 17 project priority provinces with high burdens of communicable diseases. \n \n\n \n\n\f 18 \n\nRisks \n\ninvestment  requires  adequate  government  budget \n\nB. \n \n74. \nThe  Project  will  support  technologies  and  procedures  that  are  well  understood  in  Viet \nNam. The Project has minimal technical risks. The Project does not have any adverse social or \nphysical  impact.  Land  acquisition  and  resettlement  is  not  required,  as  the  Project  does  not \nsupport civil works.  \n \n75. \nLimited Integration of NTPs and the Health System. The Project will provide support \nto  NTPs  in  the  17  project  priority  provinces.  While  these  programs  have  generally  been \nsuccessful,  they  do  not  always  coordinate  with  the  rest  of  the  health  system  as  they  focus \nnarrowly on one health issue. The Project will work to support ongoing efforts to integrate NTPs \ninto  the  health  system,  through  the  provision  of  training  in  the  management  of  communicable \ndisease programs and support for quality of care standards.  \n \nLow  Budget  for  Operation  and  Maintenance.  The  Project  will  supply  laboratory \n76. \nequipment.  This \nfor  operation  and \nmaintenance  to  ensure  the  equipment  is  sustainable.  The  Project  will  carry  out  a  careful \nassessment  to  ensure  that  the  equipment  purchased  is  needed  and  is  not  available  in  the \nprovince.  The  Project  will  provide  support  for  the  purchase  of  reagents  and  other  supplies \nnecessary to operate the equipment.  \n \n77. \nProject Investments not Sustainable. The Project will provide substantial and needed \nsupport for training and NTPs. This could provide the Government with an incentive to reduce \nits own contribution to these programs, thus reducing the sustainability of the Project after ADB \nfinancing  ends.  The  Project  has  specific  assurances  to  ensure  that  government  investment  is \nmaintained  during  the  life  of  the  Project  and  increases  to  ensure  that  after  the  end  of  the \nProject, the Project\u2019s investments are sustainable.  \n \nTrained  Staff  Leave  Preventive  Health  System.  The  Project  will  invest  in  the  human \n78. \nresources of the preventive health system. Experience has shown that attracting and retaining \ntrained personnel in the preventive health system is often difficult, particularly in remote areas. \nThe Project will offer specialized training that is specific to the needs of preventive health staff. \nThis  will  make  training  attractive  to  staff  who  want  a  career  in  the  preventive  health  system. \nRecognizing the importance of this issue, the Government recently increased staff salaries.  \n \n\nV.  \n\nASSURANCES \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\nA. \n \n79. \nfollowing assurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  and  MOH  have  given  the \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\nEstablish  standards  for  service  quality.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  (a) \nby 30 June 2006, MOH will establish standards for the quality of services of PHC \nlaboratories; (b) by 31 December 2006, MOH will conduct an initial assessment \nof  the  PHC  laboratories  based  on  these  standards;  and  (c)  based  on  the  initial \nassessment, necessary measures will be taken so that by 1 June 2008 all PHC \nlaboratories  meet  the  minimum  standards  for  safety,  are  able  to  use  the \nequipment, and are certified by MOH.  \n\nAssessment  of  equipment  needs.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  MOH  will \nfinalize  an  assessment  of  the  laboratory  equipment  lists  for  each  PHC  prior  to \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n19\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n(iii) \n\n \n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\npreparing the bidding documents for laboratory equipment taking into account the \nneeds and capacities of the project province and the current stock of equipment. \n\nContinued operation of targeted programs for communicable diseases. The \nGovernment  will  ensure  that  (a)  MOH  will  continue  operation  of  the  NTPs  for \ncommunicable  diseases  or  their  equivalent  to  provide  a  means  to  channel \nsupport  to  provinces  to  fight  communicable  diseases;  and  (b)  adequate  and \ntimely  budgetary  support  will  be  provided  so  that  the  NTPs  supported  by  the \nProject  will  remain  sustainable  after  project  completion,  in  particular,  that  the \nfinancing  provided  for  NTPs  under  the  project  will  not  substitute  the  national \nbudget for NTPs. \n\nContinued government support for training. The Government will ensure that \n(a)  the  training  positions  supported  by  the  Project  will  be  additional  to  existing \ntraining  positions;  (b)  starting  from  2006,  the  amounts  allocated  in  the  national \nbudget for training of preventive health workers and the number of state-funded \ntraining  positions  in  preventive  health  will  increase  annually  so  that  at  project \ncompletion, MOH has sufficient capacity to continue training at the same level.  \n\nDevelop appropriate training for the Project. The Government will ensure that \n(a)  MOH  will  evaluate  the  quality  and  availability  of  preventive  health  courses, \nand develop and revise curricula, as necessary; (b) develop a set of transparent \ncriteria  for  the  selection  of  trainees  at  all  levels  to  ensure  that  training \nopportunities are open to all qualified applicants and carried out in a transparent \nmanner in accordance with the criteria agreed upon by MOH and ADB.  \n\nAdequate  support  for  operation  and  maintenance.  The  Government  will \nensure that adequate budget is made available on an annual basis to the project \nprovinces and national institutes for the operation and maintenance of the project \nfacilities  and  allocation  of  sufficient  health  staff  based  on  the  data  on \nexpenditures and purchases annually provided by MOH.  \n\n(vii)  Develop  detailed  epidemiological  maps.  The  Government  will  ensure  that \nMOH  will  collect  detailed  epidemiological \ninformation,  using  established \ntechniques  to  measure  burden  of  disease,  for  all  project  provinces  by  31 \nDecember 2006. This database will be updated annually. \n\n(viii)  Environment. The Government, through MOH, will ensure that the operation of \nall  project  facilities  will  comply  with  all  applicable  laws  and  regulations  of  Viet \nNam; ADB environment policies and regulations, specifically ADB\u2019s Environment \nPolicy, 2002; the summary initial environmental examination; and environmental \nmanagement  plan  (EMP)  as  set  out  in  the  summary  initial  environmental \nexamination,  including,  but  not  limited  to  (a)  preparing,  by  the  time  of  finalizing \nneeds  assessment,  an  EMP  by  the  project  province  including  options  available \nfor waste management, (b) disclosing the EMP publicly, (c) procuring equipment \nthat  meet  appropriate  environmental  standards;  (d)  properly  disposing  of  old  or \nnonfunctional  equipment;  and  (e)  providing  adequate  training  for  PHC  staff  in \nmedical waste management. \n\n(ix) \n\nEthnic minorities. The Government will ensure the implementation of the ethnic \nminority development plan prepared for the Project in accordance with applicable \n\n \n\n\f 20 \n\n \n\n(x) \n\ngovernment policies and procedures and ADB policies, specifically ADB\u2019s Policy \non  Indigenous  Peoples,  1998.  This  includes  ensuring  equal  opportunities  for \nethnic minority health staff in training, and integrating cultural sensitivities in IEC \nmaterials and in training. \n\nGender strategy. The Government will ensure that the Project\u2019s gender strategy \nis  implemented,  equal  training  opportunities  are  provided  for  men  and  women, \nand the preventive health system addresses the needs of men and women.  \n\nConditions for Loan and Grant Effectiveness \n\n \nB. \n \n80. \nFull  Operation  of  PMU  and  PIUs.  Prior  to  the  effectiveness  of  the  loan  and  grant \nagreements  (i)  MOH  will  issue  a  decision  establishing  clear  guidelines  for  implementing  the \nProject,  specifying  the  roles  and  responsibilities  of  the  PMU,  PIUs,  and  other  agencies \nconcerned, as well as the arrangements for the flow of funds provided under the Project; and (ii) \nthe  PMU  and  PIUs  will  have  established  and  become  operational,  in  a  manner  satisfactory  to \nADB. \n \n\n \n81. \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve \n\nI am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of  the \n\nVI.  \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n(i)  \n\n(ii) \n\nthe loan in various currencies equivalent to Special Drawing Rights 19,222,000 to \nthe  Socialist  Republic  of  Viet  Nam  for  the  Preventive  Health  System  Support \nProject from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources with an interest charge at the rate of \n1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter; a term \nof  32  years,  including  a  grace  period  of  8  years;  and  such  other  terms  and \nconditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft Loan \nAgreement presented to the Board; and \n\nthe grant not exceeding the equivalent of $10,140,000 to the Socialist Republic of \nViet  Nam  for  the  Preventive  Health  System  Support  Project  from  the  Asian \nDevelopment  Fund  in accordance with  the  terms  and  conditions  set  forth  in  the \ndraft Grant Agreement presented to the Board. \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n\n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n1 August 2005\n \n\n \n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n21\n\nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n\nDesign Summary \n\nPerformance Targets/Indicators  Data Sources/Reporting \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nImpact \nImproved health status of the \npopulation  \n\nOutcome \nThe Ministry of Health \ndevelops a comprehensive \npublic health system that \nintegrates the reduction of \nmajor communicable \ndiseases, with new emerging \nchallenges in \nnoncommunicable diseases \nincluding food safety and \noccupation health. \n\nMechanisms \n\n \n\u2022  Household surveys  \n\u2022  Surveillance system        \n\u2022  Final project evaluation \n\u2022  Census, 2009 \n\nAssumptions and \nRisks \n\n \nAssumption: \n\u2022  The current pace \nof economic \ndevelopment and \npoverty reduction \nwill continue. \n\n \n\u2022  Communicable \n\ndisease surveillance \nsystem  \n\n \n\u2022  Noncommunicable \n\ndisease surveillance \nsystem \n\n \n\u2022  Demographic and \nhealth surveys  \n\n \n\u2022  Burden of disease \n\nestimates \n\n \nAssumptions:  \n\u2022  The current pace \nof economic \ndevelopment and \npoverty reduction \nwill continue. \n\u2022  Current focus on \nHIV/AIDS will \ncontinue and \nincrease. \n\n \nRisk: \nReduction in \ngovernment support \nfor the health sector. \n \n \n\n \nSubstantial progress in meeting the \nhealth-related Viet Nam \ndevelopment goals (VDGs):  \n\u2022  Substantially reduce \n\ncommunicable diseases by \n2015 (not quantified in VDGs \nbut monitorable through \ncontinuing analysis of burden of \ndisease).  \n\n\u2022  Reduce child mortality rate from \n48 per 1,000 to 26 per 1,000 by \n2015. \n\n \n \nMeet major communicable targets \nin the National Strategy for \nPeople's Health Care and \nProtection 2001\u20132010 and National \nStrategy on Communicable \nDiseases:  \n\u2022  Reduce DALYs for gastro-\nintestinal, vector, vial, and \nbacteria diseases by 15% \nbetween 2002 and 2010 in 17 \nprovinces.  \n\n\u2022  Reduce TB infection rate from \n71/100,000 in 2002 to 60 in \n2010. \n\n\u2022  Reduce incidence of malaria \n\nfrom 236/100,000 in 2002 to 200 \nin 2010. \n\n\u2022  Reduce incidence of leprosy from \n\n1.5/100,000 in 2002 to 1.2 in \n2010. \n\n \nMeet the targets for \nnoncommunicable diseases in the \nNational Strategy for People's \nHealth Care and Protection 2001\u2013\n2010 and National Strategy on \nNoncommunicable Disease \nPrograms: \n\u2022  The annual increase in \n\noccupational-related diseases \nreduced from 15% in 2002 to \n10% in 2010 annually. \n\n\u2022  Massive food poisoning cases \nreduced from 2,000 in 2002 to \n1,500 in 2010. \n\n\u2022  Incidence and mortality from \n\nfood-borne diseases decreases \nfrom 1.1/1,000 in 2002 to 0.9 in \n2010. \n\n \n\n\f22 \n\n \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n \n\nDesign Summary \n\nPerformance Targets/Indicators  Data Sources/Reporting \n\nOutputs \n1.

From  1998  to  2001,  Viet  Nam  received \ndisbursements to the health sector of $364 million. Figure A2 shows that hospitals, clinics, and \nfamily planning have received the bulk of external support.

These projects include the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) Health Care in the Central Highlands Project and Rural Health Project. The Health Care \nin  the  Central  Highlands  Project  supports  preventive  health  centers  in  all  five  central  highland \nprovinces  with  approximately  $1.5  million  in  support.  The  Rural  Health  Project  supports \npreventive  health  centers  in  eight  provinces,  with  support  of  approximately  $200,000  per \nprovince.  The  European  Union\u2019s  Health  Systems  Development  Program  Project  provides \nsupport to provincial preventive health centers in three provinces. The World Bank is currently \npreparing a comprehensive project for the Mekong Delta region, which will include an estimated \n$4  million  for  preventive  health  services  development  to  13  provinces.  The  World  Health \nOrganization continues to provide significant technical support to the health surveillance system \nand food safety.  \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n27\n\nEPIDEMIOLOGICAL TRANSITION \n\n \n1. \nViet Nam has made remarkable progress over the past decades in improving the living and \nhealth  standards  of  its  population.  As  a  result  of  rapid  economic  growth  and  targeted  public \ninvestment, Viet Nam will be able to achieve several of the health-related Viet Nam development \ngoals  (VDGs)  by  2015.  Viet  Nam  has  also  made  significant  gains  in  the  control  of  several \ncommunicable diseases, including malaria and tuberculosis.  \n \n2. \nHowever,  the  country  faces  increased  regional  inequality  in  health,  with  differences  in \nepidemiological  patterns  growing  throughout  the  country.  This  is  reflected  by  an  increase  in \nnoncommunicable  diseases  and  reduction  in  the  burden  from  communicable  disease  due  to \nhigher  levels  of  development.  However  other  provinces  still  have  traditional  epidemiological \npatterns, with communicable diseases still a major public health risk.  \n \n3. \nThe  burden  of  disease  is  a  tool  that  aggregates  the  total  morbidity  and  mortality  in  one \nmeasure, called disability adjusted life years (DALY). The analysis expresses morbidity in terms of \nyears that have been lost through disability due to contacting or living with a specific disease. The \nanalysis  also  expresses  mortality  in  terms  of  years  lost  due  to  a  premature  death,  again  from \nspecific diseases. Table A3.1 and A3.2 illustrate the distribution of disease incidence in terms of \ncommunicable and noncommunicable diseases.  \n \n\nTable A3.1: Burden of Disease for Selected Health Indicators in Viet Nam Provincesa \n\n46 Project  \nProvinces \n\n17 Priority Provinces \n\nPoor \n\nGeneral Population \n\n      % \n\nDALYs \n\n     % \n\nSelected Leading Causes of Burden of Diseases \n\nIndicator \n  \n\nCNPM \nNCD \nInjuries and Accidents \n \nTotal  \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nTuberculosis \nHIV/AIDS \nMalaria \nParasitic Diseases \nLung Cancer \nDiabetes \nStroke \nHypertension \nTraffic Accidents \n\nDALYs \n404.0 \n1,343.0 \n285.0 \n2,031.0 \n\n73.3 \n84.6 \n52.0 \n102.4 \n31.9 \n49.2 \n351.8 \n367.1 \n229.0 \n\n19.9 \n66.1 \n14.0 \n100.0 \n\n3.6 \n4.2 \n2.6 \n5.0 \n1.6 \n2.4 \n17.3 \n18.1 \n11.3 \n\n85.0 \n113.0 \n18.0 \n216.0 \n\n15.6 \n17.8 \n11.2 \n21.5 \n2.7 \n4.1 \n29.5 \n30.8 \n4.0 \n\n39.4 \n52.3 \n8.3 \n100.0 \n\n7.2 \n8.2 \n5.2 \n10.0 \n1.3 \n1.9 \n13.7 \n14.3 \n1.9 \n\nDALYs \n125.0 \n191.0 \n72.0 \n388.0 \n\n16.0 \n8.8 \n33.4 \n35.5 \n4.1 \n7.0 \n54.1 \n50.1 \n6.3 \n\n% \n32.2 \n49.2 \n18.6 \n100.0 \n\n4.1 \n2.3 \n8.6 \n9.1 \n1.1 \n1.8 \n13.9 \n12.9 \n1.6 \n\nDALY = disability adjusted life years; CNPM = communicable, nutritional, and perinatal; HIV/AIDS = human \nimmunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome; NCD = non-communicable diseases. \na DALYs are based on 2002 and per 1,000 population. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates and project preparatory technical assistance consultants. \n\n \n4. \nThe  greatest  disease  burden  comes  from  hypertension,  heart  failure,  stroke,  and  traffic \naccidents.  General  parasitic  infections  result  in  the  single  largest  disease  burden  among \ncommunicable  diseases,  followed  by  HIV/AIDS,  tuberculosis,  and  malaria.  These  patterns  vary \nfrom  province  to  province,  with  poorer  regions  suffering  more  from  communicable  diseases  and \nricher provinces suffering more from noncommunicable diseases, accidents, and HIV/AIDS.  \n \n\n\fTable A3.2: Selected Characteristics for 46 Provincesa \n\nProvince \n\nPriority \nProvince \n\nTotal Pop \n(\u2018000) \n\n%  Pop \nBelow \nPoverty \n\n% \nEM  \n\nPrevent \nStaff \nper \n100,000  \n\n% \nCD \n\n% \nNCD \n\nBurden  of \nDisease \n(DALY per \n1,000) \n\nHealth \nbudget \nper \nCapita \n(D) \n\nLevel b \n\n \n28 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\nHa Noi \nHai Phong \nVinh Phuc \nHa Tay \nBac Ninh \nHai Duong \nHung Yen \nHa Nam \nNam Dinh \nThai Binh \nNinh Binh \nHa Giang \nCao Bang \nLao Cai \nBac Kan \nLang Son  \nTuyen Quang \nYen Bai \nThai Nguyen  \nPhu Tho \nBac Giang \nQuang Ninh \nLai Chau  \nDien Bien \nSon La \nHoa Binh \nThanh Hoa \nNghe An \nHa Tinh \nQuang Binh \nQuang Tri  \nThua Thien Hue \nDa Nang \nQuang Nam  \nQuang Ngai  \nBinh Dinh \nPhu Yen \nKhanh Hoa \nHo Chi Minh \nNinh Thuan \nBinh Phuoc \nTay Ninh \nBinh Duong \nDong Nai \nBinh Thuan \nBa Ria- Vung Tau \nTotal Priority Provinces \nTotal Project Provinces \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nX \nX \nX \nX \nX \n \nX \n \n \n \n \nX \nX \nX \nX \nX \n \n \nX \nX \n \n \nX \nX  \n \n \n \n \nX \nX \n \n \n \n \n\n2,931.4 \n1,726.9 \n1,127.5 \n2,452.5 \n971.3 \n1,684.2 \n1,101.4 \n805.8 \n1,931.7 \n1,828.8 \n894.3 \n637.7 \n505.7 \n628.7 \n286.3 \n719.9 \n702.9 \n707.3 \n1,072.8 \n1,301.4 \n1,534.9 \n1,039.8 \n320.5 \n431.9 \n938.7 \n782.6 \n3,534.1 \n2,951.5 \n1,299.6 \n825.5 \n596.8 \n1,091.6 \n724.0 \n1,420.9 \n1,223.6 \n1,513.1 \n823.6 \n1,080.8 \n5,479.0 \n542.6 \n719.4 \n1,001.6 \n787.5 \n2,095.5 \n1,096.7 \n856.1 \n14,822.2 \n       58,730.4 \n\n1.5 \n7.3 \n7.7 \n5.8 \n8.3 \n5.1 \n12.8 \n11.6 \n7.4 \n7.0 \n9.3 \n22.0 \n20.3 \n22.2 \n26.5 \n14.5 \n7.0 \n17.3 \n10.9 \n16.4 \n13.9 \n13.0 \n\n0.4 \n0.1 \n3.4 \n1.2 \n0.1 \n0.3 \n0.1 \n0.1 \n0.1 \n0.1 \n2.1 \n87.9 \n95.3 \n66.9 \n86.7 \n83.5 \n51.8 \n50.4 \n24.8 \n14.6 \n11.9 \n11.1 \n\nn.a. \n4.81 \n3.99 \n2.08 \n0.00 \n3.21 \n3.00 \n5.71 \n1.76 \n3.26 \n5.37 \n4.39 \n8.11 \n7.00 \n12.22 \n9.03 \n6.97 \n5.37 \n8.39 \n4.99 \n2.41 \n7.21 \n\n8.11 \n\n10 \n17 \n17 \n11 \n13 \n10 \n9 \n14 \n11 \n14 \n14 \n45 \n55 \n38 \n42 \n26 \n26 \n35 \n15 \n19 \n22 \n24 \n\n64 \n\n79 \n77 \n71 \n81 \n80 \n80 \n76 \n75 \n84 \n81 \n75 \n38 \n23 \n42 \n47 \n51 \n64 \n47 \n61 \n69 \n71 \n53 \n\n28 \n\n141 \n69 \n38 \n89 \n34 \n57 \n36 \n24 \n59 \n57 \n29 \n12 \n11 \n17 \n9 \n23 \n23 \n22 \n42 \n38 \n47 \n52 \n\n106,912 \n108,338 \n64,915 \n44,542 \n67,787 \n62,042 \n61,161 \n63,765 \n53,991 \n69,399 \n53,451 \n86,890 \n95,176 \n88,779 \n122,952 \n49,110 \n66,152 \n86,568 \n75,970 \n71,893 \n49,370 \n124,912 \n\n28.9 \n\n83.1 \n\n15 \n\n116,392 \n\n82.6 \n72.3 \n16.4 \n13.3 \n0.1 \n1.9 \n9.0 \n3.7 \n0.6 \n6.8 \n11.6 \n2.0 \n5.1 \n4.6 \n8.8 \n22.0 \n19.2 \n1.5 \n2.5 \n8.3 \n6.9 \n2.7 \n39.0 \n14.2 \nCD  =  communicable  disease,  D  =  dong,  DALY  =  disability  adjusted  life  year,  EM  =  ethnic  minority,  NCD  =  non-communicable \ndisease. \na  Table A3.2 excludes Central Highlands region (5 provinces, with 4.1 million people, of which 33.2% are ethnic minorities.) and the \n\n78,839 \n59,406 \n51,836 \n40,850 \n49,926 \n78,223 \n87,466 \n47,855 \n183,267 \n78,431 \n71,224 \n87,373 \n62,746 \n139,002 \n222,874 \n101,090 \n86,445 \n104,999 \n108,322 \n84,473 \n77,711 \n118,399 \n \n \n\n3.52 \n3.83 \n1.73 \n1.52 \n3.54 \n5.21 \n9.55 \n0.00 \n8.98 \n2.53 \n0.00 \n3.37 \n4.86 \n4.90 \n0.00 \n5.90 \n6.95 \n6.09 \n7.62 \n2.82 \n3.83 \n7.83 \n \n \n\n23.8 \n17.9 \n16.1 \n17.3 \n18.9 \n38.0 \n27.6 \n27.4 \n12.0 \n26.0 \n22.9 \n10.7 \n9.4 \n10.0 \n10.9 \n15.1 \n16.7 \n7.3 \n5.4 \n5.1 \n11.8 \n7.9 \n21.4 \n12.9 \n\n18 \n23 \n70 \n88 \n47 \n27 \n18 \n34 \n38 \n37 \n30 \n49 \n27 \n44 \n251 \n16 \n26 \n32 \n43 \n87 \n38 \n38 \n \n \n\n46 \n32 \n19 \n24 \n37 \n28 \n33 \n25 \n20 \n17 \n24 \n16 \n28 \n20 \n16 \n41 \n33 \n20 \n16 \n13 \n20 \n21 \n \n \n\n31 \n55 \n74 \n67 \n54 \n49 \n48 \n67 \n67 \n55 \n49 \n64 \n58 \n62 \n71 \n38 \n34 \n62 \n51 \n66 \n58 \n62 \n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n\nMekong Delta (13 provinces with14.5 million people, of which 8.6% are ethnic minorities). \n\nb   Level and capacity of laboratory: Level 1, 2, 2a, 2b (Ministry of Health, Preventive Health Master Plan, 2004). \nSources: MOH and provincial annual reports, 2002; Ministry of Health. 2002.

The  principal \nunit responsible for the delivery of health care, responsible for managing and directing provincial \nhealth care, is the provincial health service. The provincial health service is under control of the \nPeople\u2019s Committee and receives technical direction and monitoring from the Ministry of Health \n(MOH). The district health center is a unit of the provincial health service and is responsible for \nformulating  and  implementing  a  district  health  plan  including  curative  and  preventive  services, \nand  family  planning.  The  district  health  center  provides  technical  support  to  commune  health \ncenters, which are the first level of health care in the public health system.   \n \nthe  control  of  communicable  and \n2. \nnoncommunicable  disease,  human \nimmunodeficiency \nsyndrome  (HIV/AIDS),  prevention  of  injuries,  school  health,  occupational  health,  community \nnutrition,  safe  water,  vaccines  and  biomedical  products,  chemical  and  pesticide  control,  food \nsafety,  health  promotion,  and  production  of  vaccines  and  biomedical  products.  The  preventive \nhealth  system  operates  through  preventive  institutions  and  specific  health  programs.  The \npreventive institutions are established from the national to the district levels. \n \nThe  central  policy  units  in  MOH  are  the  Department  of  Preventive  Medicine  and \n3. \nHIV/AIDS  Control  and  the  Food  Safety  and  Hygiene  Administration.  In  addition,  12  preventive \nmedicine  institutes  and  2  centers  provide  technical  guidance  for  national  and  regional \npreventive health activities.   \n \n4. \nAt  the  province  level,  the  preventive  health  center  (PHC)  is  the  primary  institution \nresponsible for providing preventive health services.1 The PHC is responsible for planning and \nmanagement,  supervision  of  district  services,  and  laboratory  services.  The  PHC  has  an \nepidemiological  unit  responsible  for  monitoring  disease  and  providing  support  to  epidemic \ncontrol  measures.  There  are  a  total  of  64  provincial  PHCs,  28  malaria  stations,  20  social \ndisease centers, 4 occupational health centers, and 4 stations for border quarantine.  \n \nEach  district  has  a  preventive  health  team,  with  5  to  7  technical  staff,  as  part  of  the \n5. \ndistrict  health  center.  They  supervise  and  support  commune  preventive  activities  and  have  a \nlimited  laboratory  capacity.  Each  commune  health  center  has  at  least  one  staff  with  primary \nresponsibility  for  preventive  health  activities  in  its  jurisdiction.  Other  staff  perform  a  mix  of \ncurative and preventive health tasks.  \n \n6. \nFor priority communicable diseases, such as malaria, tuberculosis, dengue, leprosy, and \nHIV/AIDS, national targeted programs (NTPs) are organized in a vertical structure. Most of the \npreventive activities are implemented in the communities with the help of commune health staff \nand  village  health  workers.  For  family  and  village-based  activities,  such  as  mosquito  control, \nand  water,  sanitation,  the  health  staff  work  closely  with  local  people\u2019s  committees  and  mass \norganizations such as the Women\u2019s Union. \n \n\n                                                 \n1   MOH  Decision  No.  2468/1999/QD-BYT.  17  August  1999.

Given  the  Project\u2019s  significant  contribution  in  reducing  the  burden  of  communicable \ndiseases  of  the  poor,  the  Government  is  requesting  a  grant  of  $10,140,000  from  the  Asian \nDevelopment  Fund  (ADF)  for  human  immunodeficiency  virus/acquired  immunodeficiency \nsyndrome (HIV/AIDS) and infectious disease control. ADF has allocated 2% of its resources (an \nestimated  $140  million)  to  reduce  the  spread  of  HIV/AIDS  and  other  infectious  diseases  for \nADF-eligible countries, including Viet Nam. \n \nA. \n \nThe goal of the Preventive Health System Support Project is to assist the health system \n2. \nin  meeting  the  health-related  Viet  Nam  development  goals  (VDG)  by  2015.  The  Project  will \nprovide  substantial support  to  combating  and  reducing  the  burden  of communicable  diseases, \nwith a particular focus on poor and ethnic minorities.  \n \n3. \nAlignment with Government Strategy. The Project is closely aligned with Viet Nam\u2019s \nComprehensive Poverty Reduction and Growth Strategy and the Health Sector Strategy, 2001\u2013\n2010.  Both  of  these  documents  highlight  several  concerns  that  are  addressed  by  the  Project, \nincluding the control of infectious and communicable diseases, the need to close the widening \ngap in health outcomes, and the need to increase investment in basic laboratory services.  \n \n4. \nInfectious  Disease  Control.  Most  of  the  project  components  directly  support  Viet \nNam\u2019s efforts to detect and control infectious diseases. This is done by strengthening the health \nsurveillance  system,  supporting  communicable  disease  control  (CDC)  efforts,  providing  new \nequipment  in  the  areas  of  infectious  disease  control  and  food  safety  (which  account  for  two \nthirds  of  the  investment  in  equipment),  and  targeting  training  particularly  in  the  area  of  CDC. \nThe Project focuses on reducing the burden of communicable diseases in 17 provinces where \nthey  are  still  significant  threats,  and  it  will  prepare  the  country  as  a  whole  for  the  risk  of  new \noutbreaks from emerging communicable diseases such as avian flu and SARS.  \n \nViet Nam Development Goals. The Project will support Viet Nam\u2019s efforts to meet the \n5. \nhealth-related  goals  in  the  VDG,  particularly  goals  4,  5,  and  6  related  to  reduction  of  child \nmortality; maternal mortality; and HIV/AIDS and communicable disease. The Project will target \nvulnerable  populations  by  providing  targeted  assistance  to  17  poor  provinces  that  lag  the \ncountry  in  health  statistics.  This  directly  supports  ADB\u2019s  commitment  to  poverty  reduction  and \nassists developing member countries in achieving the Millennium Development Goals.  \n \nB. \n \n6. \nThe  Project  has  four  components:  (i)  health  surveillance  and  priority  health  issues,  (ii) \nstrengthening the preventive health system, (iii) human resource development, and (iv) project \nmanagement.  The  Project  will  provide  equipment,  training,  and  support  to  46  provinces,1 \nrepresenting around 75% of the population of Viet Nam and four national institutes. The Project \nwill  provide  additional,  targeted  support  to  the  preventive  health  system  in  the  17  priority \n\nProposed Grant Activities \n\n                                                 \n1   The Project excludes provinces in the central highlands and Mekong Delta regions because their preventive health \n\nsystems will receive substantial and parallel support from other projects.  \n\n\f(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\n \n(iv) \n\n32 \n\n  Appendix 5 \n\nprovinces.2  These  provinces  are  the  poorest  among  the  46  provinces  and  have  a  high \nproportion of ethnic minorities. The burden of disease is substantially higher in these provinces \nand is largely due to communicable diseases. The Government requests financing through an \nADF grant for $10,140,000 for the following components:  \n \n\nComponent  A.1  Public  Health  Surveillance  System.  Strong  public  health \nsurveillance is essential for monitoring and tracking the epidemiological situation, \nparticularly  of  communicable  diseases.  An  improved  surveillance  system  will \nallow  provinces  to  accelerate  and  target  their  responses  to  outbreaks  of \ncommunicable diseases.  \n\nComponent  A.2  Quality  of  Services.  Strengthening  the  quality  of  services  of \npreventive health services is essential to ensure the relevance of the preventive \nhealth  systems.  This  component  will  improve  the  management  capacity  of  the \npreventive  health  services  to  manage  communicable  diseases  and  to  integrate \ntheir activities with the curative health system.  \n\nComponent  A.3  Support  to  Combat  Priority  Communicable  Diseases.  The \nProject  will  support  the  provinces  to  control  communicable  diseases  through \nincreased  surveillance  and  behavior  change  and  communication  activities, \nincreased technical support, and materials support. This component will focus on \n17  provinces  with  high \nfrom \ncommunicable diseases. The component will support existing NTPs operating in \nthe  provinces.  Because  of  the  significant  support  for  HIV/AIDS,  this  component \nwill focus on other communicable diseases.  \n\nlevels  of  poverty  and  burden  of  disease \n\nComponent  C  Human  Resource  Development.  The  Project  will  provide \nsignificant support to strengthening the capacity of staff in the preventive health \nsystem,  with  a  particular  focus  on  management  of  communicable  diseases, \npublic  health,  and  epidemiology.  Staff  will  be  trained  in  the  areas  of  behavior \nchange  communication, \ninfectious  disease  control,  occupational  health, \nenvironmental  health,  food  safety,  medical  waste  management,  and  school \nhealth.  This  will  update  the  knowledge  of  frontline  preventive  health  staff  and \nlaboratory  technicians  on  CDC  and  improve  the  system\u2019s  capacity  to  manage \ncommunicable  disease  outbreaks.  The  Project  will  also  support  the  training  of \ncommune  and  district  preventive  health  staff  in  the  17  priority  provinces  with \nthe  spread  of \ncourses \ncommunicable diseases. \n\nfocusing  on  maternal  mortality  and  controlling \n\nMonitoring and Evaluation \n\n \nC. \n \n7. \nthe  project \nperformance, which emphasizes the quantifiable improvement of health in Viet Nam. The design \nand  monitoring  framework  (Appendix  1)  has  clearly  distinguishable  indicators  to  measure  the \ninputs, activities, and outputs financed through the grant. The outcomes and impact are closely \naligned to the VDGs and to the Government\u2019s health strategy. \n\nGrant  effectiveness  will  be  assessed  within  a  broader  context  of \n\n                                                 \n2   These provinces are Binh Phuoc, Cai Bac, Cao Bang, Dien Bien, Ha Giang, Hoa Binh, Lai Chau, Lao Can, Lang \nSon, Ninh Thuan, Quang Binh, Quang Nam, Quang Ngai, Quang Tri, Son La, Thanh Hoa, and Yen Bai. The total \npopulation of these 17 provinces is 14.8 million, of which 39% are ethnic minorities. \n\n\fAppendix 6 \n\n33\n\n \n\n \n\n \nA. \n\nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY \n\nLinkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \n\nIs the sector identified as a national \npriority in country poverty analysis?   \n\n  Yes \n    No \n\nIs the sector identified as a national \npriority in the National Poverty \nReduction Strategy?   \n\n Yes \n  No \n\n \n\n \n\nPoverty Analysis  \n\nTargeting Classification: Targeted intervention \n\nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in Viet Nam: \nPoor health is a leading cause of poverty in Viet Nam. Many households are forced to drain their savings to pay for \nexpensive medical bills, in addition to losing the income from sick family members  who are unable to work. Thus, \nwell-targeted  investment  can  improve  equity  and  efficiency  within  the  economy.  The  preventive  health  system  in \nViet Nam plays an important role in protecting the health of the poor. The poor have less access to both public and \nprivate preventive health services and suffer from a higher burden of disease, particularly communicable disease.   \nB. \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed? \nUsing the international poverty line, the poverty rate in Viet Nam rapidly decreased from 58% to 29% from 1994 to \n2002.  The  poverty  rate  in  the  ethnic  minority  population  has  been  estimated  to  be  from  two  to  three  times  higher \nthan the national average and has not declined as rapidly as poverty in the general population. The burden disease \nis largely determined by geographic conditions, economic opportunities, and access to education. Even controlling \nfor these factors, ethnic minorities have a greater burden of disease.  \n \nViet Nam has achieved a high level of human development nationwide. However, the level of inequality in a number \nof areas, including health status, has increased. The public health system faces challenges in protecting the health \nof the poor and in responding to the changing patterns of disease associated with ongoing social, demographic, and \nepidemiological transitions. The poor and disadvantaged tend to suffer from a greater burden of disease. The health \nstatus of the rural population and ethnic minorities is significantly  worse than that of their urban counterparts. The \nProject will address preventive health concerns through national investment to support the preventive health system \nfor communicable and noncommunicable diseases. This Project has a number of targeted investments that focus on \npoor  provinces  and  diseases  that  disproportionately  affect  the  poor.  The  Project  supports  training  and  provides \nsupport  to  help  bring  the  provincial  preventive  health  centers  closer  to  the  community.  Using  the  national  poverty \nline  (which  is  lower  than  the  international  poverty  line),  38%  of  the  project  benefits  are  expected  to  accrue  to  the \npoor population, which represent about 12% of the population of the project provinces.  \nC.  Participation Process \nIs there a stakeholder analysis? \nA stakeholder analysis was prepared to help identify key project stakeholders, their project-related interests, and the \nways in which they affect project feasibility and success. Primary stakeholders include the Ministry of Health (MOH), \npreventive health staff at different levels, line ministries, development partners, and mass organizations. \n \nIs there a participation strategy? \nParticipation is integrated into the overall project design. MOH will coordinate with different departments at various \nlevels within the ministry, and other line ministries. During project design, MOH carried out initial consultations with \ndifferent  stakeholders,  and  held  a  number  of  regional  workshops.  The  involvement  of  stakeholders  will  continue \nduring project implementation. A project cell will be established within the Department of Science and Training, and \nthe  Department  of  Preventive  Medicine  and  HIV/AIDS  Control  to  assist  with  project  implementation.  Moreover, \nconfirmation  of  a  training  and  equipment  needs  assessment  for  each  province  will  involve  continued  stakeholder \nparticipation.  \n \nIn addition, coordination with other agencies and mass organizations working with vulnerable communities will help \ndeliver information about quality preventive health services. As part of the support to the national targeted programs \n(NTPs)  in  the  17  priority  provinces,  the  Project  will  improve  information,  education,  and  communication  (IEC) \nmaterials  for  use  by  health  care  workers.  These  IEC  materials  will  be  used  to  enhance  community  outreach  to \nethnic minority and other disadvantaged groups on the availability and importance of seeking preventive care. The \nmaterials will discuss prevention of communicable and noncommunicable diseases that are commonly found within \neach province through improved surveillance. Health care workers will be trained in delivering these IEC materials \nthrough annual district and commune workshops. \n \nD.  Gender Development \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \nWomen  compromise  about  51%  of  the  population  in  the  46  project  provinces.  The  burden  of  disease  profile  for \ndisadvantaged  groups  remains  heavily  influenced  by  common  communicable  and  infectious  diseases,  and  by \n\n   Yes               \n\n   No  \n\n  Yes \n\n   No \n\n\f34 \n\n  Appendix 6 \n\nmorbidity and mortality associated with childbearing. According to the Vietnam National Health Survey 2001\u20132002 \non  reproductive-aged  women  (18\u201334  years),  the  coverage  for  prenatal  care  and  immunization  in  ethnic  minority \ngroups is lower (about 1.5 times) than that for the Kinh population. Women and children in these population groups \ncontinue to bear a health burden that is not comparable with those of better-off communities.  \n \nThe Project will provide training to commune and district health care workers in the 17 priority provinces focusing on \nwoman  and  child  preventive  care,  and  family  disease  control.  The  IEC  materials  that  will  be  prepared  for  use  in \nthese  communities  will  take  into  consideration  the  special  needs  of  ethnicity  and  gender.  The  Project  will  also \nsupport equal opportunity for training for women. A gender strategy for the Project has been prepared. \n\nHas an output been prepared? \n\n    Yes \n\n   No \n\n \nE.

The  Project  provides \ntraining opportunities for current and additional preventive \nhealth staff at the national, provincial, and local levels. \nEthnic  minorities  constitute  about  14%  of  the  total \npopulation  in  the  46  project  provinces.  The  Project \nsupports  efforts  to  improve  curricula  with  supplements  to \nbetter respond to ethnic minority needs.

During  project  preparation,  the  Government  and  the  Asian  Development  Bank \n(ADB) prepared a summary initial environmental examination (SIEE) outlining recommendations \nand steps taken to protect the environment from potential adverse effects. The SIEE is based \non  field  visits  to  project  provinces,  discussions  with  relevant  preventive  health  staff, \nconsultations  with  various  stakeholders,  and  the  consultant  report  on  health  care  waste \nmanagement for the Project.  \n \nB. \n \n2. \nThe Project will help strengthen the provincial preventive health systems in 46 provinces, \nwith  a  special  emphasis  on  the  prevention  and  control  of  communicable  diseases  in  17 \nprovinces  identified  as  priorities  because  of  socioeconomic  and  health  conditions.  Eighteen \nprovinces  are  not  a  part  of  this  Project  because  they  are  included  in  other  similar  ADB-  and \nWorld  Bank-financed  projects.  The  goal  of  the  Project  is  to  improve  the  health  status  of  the \npopulation to allow the country to achieve the health-related Viet Nam development goals. The \nspecific  purpose  of  the  Project  is  to  support  the  health  system  to  develop  a  comprehensive \npublic  health  system  that  integrates  the  reduction  of  major  communicable  diseases  and \naddresses emerging challenges including food safety, occupational safety, and health.   \n \nThe  Project  will  purchase  new  and  more  environment-friendly  laboratory  equipment  to \n3. \nreplace  existing  and  outdated  equipment.  The  Project  will  also  contribute  to  improving  the \nenvironment  by  improving  waste  management  procedures  to  meet  Government  and  ADB \nenvironmental standards and regulations. The Project supports training for waste management, \nand selected capital investments for improved solid and liquid waste management.  \n \n4. \nThe  Project  emphasizes  the  main  principle  of  health  care  waste  management\u2014early \nsegregation of hazardous from nonhazardous waste at the health facilities and the continuous \ntraining for health care staff.1 The Project will improve the current management of infectious and \nchemical waste based on the national guidelines for waste management in health care facilities, \nas issued by the Ministry of Health (2000), and in accordance with ADB\u2019s Environment Policy.  \n \nC. \n  \n5. \nThe  Project  supports  the  procurement  of  laboratory  equipment  in  46  provincial \npreventive  health  centers  (PHCs)  and  at  4  national  institutes.  The  majority  of  PHCs  are  at \nground level with reasonable natural drainage potential.  \n \n\nForecasting Potential Environmental Impacts \n\n1. \n\nFunction of the Preventive Health Center \n\nThe  PHC  is  the  primary  institution  responsible  for  implementing  preventive  health \n6. \nactivities  in  the  country.  The  PHC  is  a  duly  authorized  administrative  entity  under  the  direct \n\n                                                 \n1  The principle is included in the Viet Nam regulation on health care solid waste management, which is attached to \nthe  Health  Minister\u2019s  Decision  No.  2575/1999/Qd-BYT  (27  August  1999).  There  are  a  number  of  other  related \ndecisions on the handling of toxic and non-toxic waste.  \n\n\f36 \n\n \n\nAppendix 7 \n\n \n\nresponsibility of the provincial health service.2 The PHC receives technical support from several \ntechnical  departments  of  the  Ministry  of  Health  (MOH)  and  a  number  of  national  and  regional \ninstitutions.  The  PHC  has  a  number  of  administrative  and  technical  departments,  such  as \nepidemiology,  labor  health,  food  safety  and  hygiene  control,  malaria  and  goiter  control, \nlaboratory,  border  health  control,  HIV/AIDS,  and  environmental  health.  The  PHC  also  has  a \nnumber  of  laboratories,  including  microbiological;  chemistry;  food  safety  and  sanitation; \noccupational,  environmental,  and  school  hygiene;  HIV/AIDS  (hematology);  and  malaria \n(parasitology). The exact organization varies from one province to another, following the general \nmodel prescribed by MOH.  \n \n7. \nAccording to a survey of PHC laboratories, about 12% of the equipment is more than 15 \nyears old and 23% is more than 10 years old. Only 34% of available equipment is relatively new \n(less than 5 years of age). Much of this older equipment produces unnecessary waste that could \nbe  harmful  to  the  environment;  newer  and  better  functioning  equipment  will  help  protect  the \nenvironment from old deteriorating equipment.  \n\n \n2. \n\nPotential Wastes Generated at Preventive Health Centers \n\n8. \nSolid  Waste.  Based  on  the  characteristics  of  solid  waste  produced  in  the  PHC,  solid \nwaste  is  divided  in  three  main  groups:  (i)  infectious  health  care  waste,  including  cotton  wool, \nswab, gloves, test tubes, culture, and pipetting tip; (ii) sharp items, including needles and broken \nglass; and (iii) general waste. Hazardous waste in PHCs is often not treated safely before being \nsent to waste disposal facilities due to the lack of infrastructure, financing, and training.   \n \nMedical  solid  waste,  including  glassware,  syringes,  dressing  of  wound,  bandages, \n9. \nplasters, plastic syringes, and test swabs, account for 10\u201315% of the total solid waste generated \nby hospitals in Viet Nam. At most PHCs, hazardous health care solid waste is often segregated, \nespecially  sharp  items.  However,  handling,  collection,  and  storage  methods  are  often  not \nappropriate. Segregation of infectious waste is done at production points but is typically mixed \nwith other waste at the disposal stage. In some cases, PHCs do not have a temporary holding \nfacility for solid waste. Commonly, wastes are burned in an incinerator or disposed of with other \ndomestic waste without treatment. Therefore, both the Government and public have expressed \nconcern about the potential impacts of hazardous health care waste on the environment and on \npeople's health. \n \n10. \nLiquid  Waste.  The  liquid  waste  has  potentially  hazardous  components.  These \ncomponents  include  microbiology  pathogens;  hazardous  chemicals  from  chemical  laboratory, \ncleaning, and disinfection operations. Although the PHC staff are aware of the liquid treatment \nplant system, they generally do not have the necessary financial resources to purchase them. \nLiquid clinical waste is often discharged without proper treatment.  \n \n11. \nGaseous  Waste.  Gaseous  waste  is  generated  from  the  laboratory  when  conducting \ntests.  Laboratories  typically  lack  ventilation  and  equipment  to  protect  health  workers  from \ninhalation  of  the  toxic  gases  while  conducting  the  testing.  Only  20%  of  preventive  health \nlaboratories  have  adequate  biological  and  chemical  safety  cabinets.  Some  chemical  safety \ncabinets at chemical laboratories are old and have no filter to absorb the toxic gases. \n \n\n                                                 \n2   Ministry  of  Health  Decision  No.2468/1999/QD-BYT  of  17  August  1999  on  Regulations,  Functions,  Authority  and \n\nOrganization of the Provincial Preventive Health Center. \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 7 \n\n37\n\nMitigation Measures \n\nReusable  Items.  In  most  laboratories,  petri  dishes,  test  tubes,  and  containers  are \n12. \nwashed  and  recycled.  However,  disposal  and  washing  of  the  contents  could  lead  to \ncontamination  of  subsequent  specimens.  The  provision  of  distilled  water  is  often  problematic. \nBudget  is  not  sufficient  to  purchase  suitable  quality  control  materials.  In  most  laboratories  no \nmonitoring of internal quality is conducted.  \n \n13. \nLaboratory  Practices.  Protective  clothes  and  gloves  are  usually  available,  but  mouth \npipetting  is  not  uncommon  and  other  basic  principles  of  hygiene  are  sometimes  not  followed. \nAlthough  microscopy  for  tuberculosis  is  common,  proper  safety  cabinets  to  protect  the  staff \nworking  with  sputa  and  other  infected  specimens  are  often  not  available.  Where  they  are \navailable, it is not clear if any maintenance is carried out on the safety hoods. The challenges in \neffective waste management include (i) use of inappropriate technology; (ii) lack of training and \nawareness among staff; (iii) high capital cost of treatment systems and low cost efficiency; and \n(iv) lack of periodic maintenance and internal monitoring.  \n \nD. \n \n14. \nThe  Project  will  improve  medical  waste  management  at  PHCs  by  replacing  and \nimproving the quality of equipment used in laboratories. When appropriate, equipment procured \nunder  the  Project  should  meet  internationally  recognized environmental  standards  to  minimize \nharmful discharge. The Project will establish quality standards and support laboratories with the \nprovision of basic protective clothing and supplies.  \n \n15. \nThe Project includes provisions for (i) proper disposal of general and solid clinical waste, \n(ii)  treatment  of  liquid  clinical  waste  before  disposal,  and  (iii)  disposal  of  discarded  medical \nequipment.  A  waste  management  system  for  handling,  storing,  and  disposing  of  waste  will  be \ndeveloped, with medical waste will be separated at the source, and placed into clearly labeled \ndedicated containers, with appropriate lining. Similar segregation procedures will be undertaken \nfor  chemical  waste  and  domestic  waste.  This  follows  regulations  issued  under  Minister  of \nHealth's Decision No. 2575.  \n \n16. \nThe  PHCs  have  existing  health  care  waste  practices  and  equipment.  These  provisions \nwill be reviewed against government standards. If necessary, technical guidance will be made to \nimprove  waste  management.  Old  and  nonfunctioning  waste  management  equipment  may  be \nreplaced or alternative methods of waste disposal sought. For example, hazardous waste may \nbe transported to nearby provincial hospitals, which have the facility to manage and dispose of \nhazardous waste.  \n \n17. \nThe technology for liquid waste disposal for each district health center will vary based on \nlocal  conditions  and  current  practices.  Depending  on  the  type,  nature,  and  organisms  in  the \nhealth  care  waste,  risk  waste  will  be  inactivated  and  rendered  safe  before  final  disposal. \nNormally,  liquid  clinical  waste  comes  from  laboratories  and  utility  rooms  where  chemical  and \nactive solutions are stored. PHCs have two options to minimize discharge of wastewater. Both \nrequire  low  maintenance  service  and  are  cost  efficient.  The  first  option  is  to  have  an \nunderground  separate  sewerage  system  that  allows  liquid  clinical  and  bio-hazardous  waste  to \nbe properly channeled into dedicated treatment tanks before discharge. The second option is to \nlocalize the discharge of clinical wastewater directly into a dedicated collection tank. Appropriate \ntank  size  with  minimal  filtration  and  small  dosage  of  active  solution  allows  dilution  and \nsedimentation of the raw wastewater and slow transfer to the reaction tank for proper treatment. \nThe waste will be properly treated before the disposal.  \n \n\n\f38 \n\n \n\nAppendix 7 \n\n \n\nDuring  project  preparation,  a  number  of  alternative  disposal  options  were  considered. \n18. \nBased  on  the  analysis,  a  single-barrel  incinerator  is  the  most  appropriate  and  cost-efficient \noption for PHCs that cannot rely on the provincial hospital for waste disposal. It has the capacity \nto treat and dispose of waste generated (less than 250 kilograms per week). At present, 15 local \nmanufacturers  have  the  necessary  production  licenses  for  medical  waste  incinerators.  The \nGovernment has recently issued provisional regulations on incinerators, including technical and \nemission  standards.  Steps  to  prevent  toxic  emissions  from  filtering  into  the  air  will  be  taken. \nPHCs that already have functioning incinerators should purchase incinerator covers. \n \n19. \nTo  increase  the  level  of  awareness  and  skill  in  waste  management,  the  Project  will \nprovide  training  for  staff  at  PHCs  on  proper  segregation  and  handling  of  health  care  waste. \nProtective clothing will be given to health staff managing and disposing of medical waste. This \ntraining will focus on proper handling and sorting of hazardous waste at PHCs. These courses \nwill be offered annually to ensure continuity and follow up.  \n \nE. \n\nInstitutional Requirements and Review Procedures \n\nThe  Project  will  support  investments  to  improve  waste  management  in  each  of  the \n\n20.  MOH will be the Executing Agency, with a project management unit (PMU) established \nwith MOH. Project cells will be established in the Department of Science and Training, and the \nDepartment  of  Preventive  Medicine  and  HIV/AIDS  Control.  The  provincial  health  service  is \nresponsible  for  project  implementation  at  the  provincial  level,  including  compliance  with \ngovernment  and  ADB  environment  standards.  A  local  environmental  specialist  (10  person-\nmonths) will provide overall technical guidance. The environmental consultant will develop a set \nof  screening  criteria  to  identify  when  a  site-specific  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE)  is \nrequired.  The  screening  will  categorize  the  proposed  investment  and  set  up  criteria  to  identify \ninvestments that cannot be supported by the Project.3 \n \n21. \nPHCs, based on local needs. The following steps review procedures will be followed. \n \n22. \nStep  1.  Each  PHC  will  carry  out  an  environmental  screening  for  the  scope  of  the \nproposed  investment  needs  and  existing  health  care  waste  management  procedures  for  its \nPHC. The purpose of this screening is twofold: (i) to identify the need for a site-specific IEE, and \n(ii) to develop an appropriate environmental management plan (EMP) following appropriate laws \nand regulations. The EMP will be developed by the staff of the PHC and will be approved by the \ndirector of the provincial health service. The EMP will take into account the expected generation \nof health care waste, the current waste management procedures, and the options available to \nmitigate waste (including using provincial facilities). It will include the following: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\na description of the PHC\u2019s procedures for proper disposal of hazardous medical \nwaste;  \nan outline of the PHC\u2019s equipment needs to support its EMP, subject to review by \nthe PMU within the context of the overall project budget and allocation for waste \nmanagement equipment; and  \noptions  for  the  proper  disposal  of  old  equipment  that  is  replaced  due  to  the \nProject.  \n\n \n23. \n\nStep  2.  Based  on  the  screening  criteria,  if  a  site-specific  IEE  is  not  necessary,  the \n\n                                                 \n3  The  Project  will  not  support  investments  classified  as  B  sensitive  or  A.  Given  the  nature  of  the  Project  and  the \n\namount of waste generated, this is very unlikely to occur.  \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 7 \n\n39\n\nprovincial health service will submit a draft EMP to the PMU and ADB for endorsement before \nimplementation. The provincial health service will also publicly disclose its EMP.  \n \n24. \nStep 3. Based on the screening criteria, if a site-specific IEE is necessary, the PHC, with \nsupport of the Project\u2019s environmental consultant, will prepare an IEE. In case an incinerator is \nprocured, the IEE will identify the necessary steps or measures to prevent toxic emissions from \nfiltering into the air. When an incinerator is purchased under the Project, there will be full public \ndisclosure of the IEE with a 60-day period for discussion prior to approval of the final document \nby the provincial authorities.  \n \n25. \nStep  4.  The  IEE  will  be  endorsed  by  the  director  of  the  provincial  health  service  and \nsubmitted to the PMU for review and endorsement. The PMU will forward the IEE to MOH and \nADB for concurrence. Once the review is endorsed, the PMU will authorize financing and assist \nthe provincial authorities with required permits and approval needed from national and provincial \nauthorities and concurrence by national authorities and ADB.  \n \nStep 5. Monitoring will be mainstreamed with each provincial authority, preparing regular \n26. \nupdates  as  part  of  the  standard  reporting.  The  provincial  authorities  will  produce  an  annual \nreport reviewing the Project's status in applying required environmental regulations that will be \nincorporated in the Project\u2019s regular reporting cycle. The midterm review will include a general \nreview of the Project's compliance with environmental standards.  \n \nF. \n\nPublic Consultation and Disclosure \n\nConclusion \n\nEach province will publicly release its EMP and discuss the EMP with local stakeholders. \n27. \nThis will ensure that the public is informed about the potential environmental hazards generated \nby the PHC.  \n \nG. \n \n28. \nThe  Project  will  contribute  to  improving  the  environment  by  improving  existing  health \ncare waste management procedures to meet government and ADB environment standards and \nregulations.  Based  on  the  SIEE  prepared  for  the  Project,  a  detailed  environmental  impact \nassessment for the Project is not required. \n\n \n\n\f40 \n\n \n\nAppendix 8 \n\n \n\nSUMMARY ETHNIC MINORITY DEVELOPMENT PLAN \n\n \n1. \nAn  ethnic  minority  development  plan  (EMDP)  was  prepared  to  assess  the  preventive \nhealth needs of ethnic minorities in the Preventive Health Systems Support Project in Viet Nam. \nThis  appendix  summarizes  the  full  EMDP,  which  was  agreed  to  by  the  Government  during \nproject preparation. The EMDP highlights project benefits for ethnic minorities in the 46 project \nprovinces,  of  which  17  priority  provinces  will  receive  additional  and  targeted  support.1  The \npreventive health needs of ethnic minorities have been taken into consideration in the design of \nthe Project. The Project will have no adverse affects on the ethnic minority population in terms \nof  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  or  the  environment.  The  EMDP  ensures  compliance  with \nthe ADB Policy on Indigenous Peoples.  \n\n \nBackground \n\nA. \n \n2. \nThe Project will benefit about 59 million people in 46 project provinces, of which 14% of \nthe population come from ethnic minority groups.2 In Viet Nam, the poverty rate for the general \npopulation is estimated at 29% (2002), and is thought to be two to three times higher for ethnic \nminority  populations.  Geographical  remoteness,  lower  human  development  levels,  and  slower \neconomic  growth  are  contributing  factors  to  the  increasing  differentials  in  income  and  living \nstandards  between  ethnic  minorities  and  the  Kinh  population.  Smaller  ethnic  minority  groups \n(less than 10,000 per group) are the most vulnerable. Out of 53 ethnic minority groups, 36 are \nestimated to have a population size of 100,000 or less. \n \n3. \nIn Viet Nam, a major challenge for the health system is to reduce inequalities in the use \nof health services. For ethnic minority groups, the burden of disease is almost twice as high as \nfor the general population. Typical communicable diseases in ethnic minority areas are malaria, \ntuberculosis,  typhoid  fever,  and  cholera.  Lifestyle  diseases  are  also  causing  concern  among \nethnic minority communities. Among some ethnic minority groups, the rate of female smoking is \nmuch higher than the national rate of 1.8%. \n\n4. \nThe epidemiological situation is worse for ethnic minority women and children. The infant \nmortality rate in 1998 was about 64 per 1,000 in the central highlands and 44 per 1,000 in the \nnorthern uplands, compared with about 37 per 1,000 for Viet Nam. From 1994 to 1998, the rate \nof  infant  mortality  reduced  in  all  regions  with  the  exception  of  the  central  coastal  provinces \nwhere an increase of 10% was found. The average child mortality rate is 2.8%, with the highest \nrates  in  ethnic  minority  regions.  Most  cases  of  child  mortality  are  a  consequence  of  perinatal \nconditions (38.8%), infectious disease (24.9%), noninfectious disease (17.0%), and accidents. \nEthnic  minority  children  suffer  more  from  respiratory  diseases,  dengue  fever,  malaria,  and \nnutritional disorders as a consequence of poor living conditions. \n \nMaternal  mortality  of  women  ages  15\u201349  was  130  per  100,000  live  births.  Likewise, \n5. \nmaternal mortality was the highest in the central and northern highlands. Reasons for maternal \ndeaths  include  lack  of  trained  professional  attendant  at  childbirth,  quality  of  prenatal  care, \nlimited equipment and facilities, and distance or lack of transport to health services. Preventive \nand health care services make it easier for the majority of women to have a safe delivery, as \nhome delivery is the most common practice for ethnic minorities. \n\n \n\n \n\n                                                 \n1  Selection  is  based  on  criteria  that  weigh  their  relative  poverty  (as  measured  by  the  provincial  Viet  Nam \n\ndevelopment goal rating) and a measure of their health needs.  \n\n2  Ethnic minority refers to the 53 ethnic groups that differ from the Kinh majority ethnic group. \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 8 \n\n41\n\nProject Benefits \n\nLegal Framework and Principles \n\nB. \n \n6. \nThe EMDP is based on Vietnamese laws. The Government recognizes ethnic minorities \nas  poor  and  underprivileged  groups.  The  Central  Communist  Party  Executive  Committee \ndirective3  provides  guidelines  for  MOH  to  formulate  polices with  priorities  for  people  in  remote \nand  mountainous  areas,  especially  ethnic  minorities.  The  Comprehensive  Poverty  Reduction \nand Growth Strategy for 2001\u20132010 (CPRGS) sets 11 goals, 7 of which deal directly with issues \nof gender and ethnic minorities: (i) achieve better education for all; (ii) reach gender equality and \nempower women; (iii) reduce infant and child mortality; (iv) improve maternal health; (v) combat \nHIV/AIDS,  malaria,  and  other  communicable  diseases;  (vi)  reduce  vulnerability;  and  (vii) \neradicate poverty and preserve ethnic minority culture.  \n \nDuring the last decade, the Government has issued decrees and guidelines4 that aim to \n7. \nreduce poverty among  ethnic minority populations. Current government policies and programs \nfor enhancing the health status of ethnic minorities will continue to (i) increase access to health \nfacilities,  (ii)  encourage  their  participation  in  training  courses,  and  (iii)  improve  utilization  of \nservices.  MOH  has  also  developed  specific  goals5  for  mountainous  ethnic  minority  regions, \nwhich  are  in  line  with  the  Government\u2019s  CPRGS  for  2010,  Strategy  for  People\u2019s  Health  Care \nand  Protection  for  2001\u20132010,  Policy  for  Public  Preventive  Health,  and  other  related \ndocuments. \n \nC. \n \n8. \nThe Project aims to improve the health status of the general population, including ethnic \nminorities  by  strengthening  the  capacity  of  preventive  health  staff  to  provide  comprehensive \npreventive  health  services  at  the  community  level,  based  on  improved  surveillance  systems. \nThe objective for the poor and ethnic minority groups is to reduce their burden of disease from \ncommon  communicable  diseases  by  increasing  accessibility  and  acceptability  of  preventive \nhealth  services  in  ethnic  minority  communities.  The  Project  will  increase  the  coverage  of \npreventive  services  for  noncommunicable  diseases  with  priority  given  to  food  safety, \noccupational health, and school health, including an increase in services for early diagnosis of \ndiseases associated with life-style behaviors. \n \n9. \nThe Project also supports the implementation of nationally targeted programs (NTPs) in \nthe priority 17 provinces.6 About 39% of the 14.8 million people are ethnic minorities. There are \ntwo  underlying  assumptions  to  providing  support  to  the  NTPs  in  these  provinces:  (i)  basic \ninfrastructure for managing the burden of communicable diseases is in place in each province, \nand (ii) specific interventions will be unique to each province.  \n \n10. \nThe  Project  will  support  the  training  of  commune  and  district  preventive  health  staff  in \nthe 17 priority provinces. Special courses will be designed to better address the needs of poor \nand ethnic minority communities, and improve the quality of surveillance activities. The training \nwill support health staff in providing relevant information on maternal and child care and family \ndisease  control  that  families  can  apply  within  their  community  and  within  available  resources \n\n                                                 \n3  Directive N 06-CT/TW of Central Party Executive Committee (2002). \n4  Decree N 95\u2013CP of 27 August 1994 on free health care; Decision 135/1998QD/-TTG on poverty alleviation.  \n5  In  particular,  these  goals  apply  to  the  central  highlands.  MOH.  2001.  Development  Strategy  for  the  Central \n\n6 National Targeted Programs focus on 10 priority health conditions and provide resources for the health system to \n\nHighlands (2001-2010). \n\naddress the health conditions.  \n\n\f42 \n\n \n\nAppendix 8 \n\n \n\nand  capabilities.  The  training  will  focus  on  the  health  needs  of  women  and  children  and  the \nprevention  of  common  communicable  disease  in  disadvantaged  communities.  Special  cultural \nand  linguistic  needs  of  ethnic  minorities  will  be  considered  in  information,  education,  and \ncommunication  activities  and  training  materials  supported  by  the  Project.  A  set  of  transparent \ncriteria  will  be  developed  for  the  selection  of  trainees  at  all  levels  to  ensure  qualified  ethnic \nminorities have an equal opportunity to participate.  \n \n11. \nfollowing activities will be incorporated as part of the needs assessment: \n\nA  needs  assessment  will  confirm  equipment  and  training  needs  of  each  province.  The \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nidentify  training  needs  for  health  staff  in  areas with  high  concentration of  ethnic \nminorities;  based  on  health  patterns,  needs,  and  epidemic  programs  in  each \nprovince, determine if additional training courses are required;  \nidentify  any  special  training  needs  and  appropriate  learning  methods  for  health \nstaff to improve service-delivery of preventive health services to ethnic minorities; \nthese needs will vary from province to province; and \nidentify  ways  in  which  district  and  commune  health  staff  can  help  to  strengthen \nthe surveillance system, such as tracking diseases by ethnicity.   \n\n \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nD. \n \nImplementation arrangements and estimated costs of the EMDP are part of the overall \n12. \narrangements and total budget. In provinces with high concentrations of ethnic minorities, each \nprovincial preventive health center will have at least one staff member aware of the traditional \nethnic minority health behaviors and practices and at least one member of the project steering \ncommittee  at  the  provincial  level  will  represent  ethnic  minority  interests.  A  national  social \ndevelopment  specialist  to  be  hired  for  10  person-months  will  help  develop  implementation \nguidelines  for  the  EMDP,  specific  to  each  province.  The  specialist  will  work  closely  with  the \nother health specialists for the Project.  \n \n13. \nThe  monitoring  of  the  EMDP  will  be  part  of  the  overall  system  for  the  Project.  Ethnic \nminorities  will  be  consulted  in  the  design  and  implementation  of  IEC  activities  and  training \nmaterials  for  preventive  health  services.  Progress  reports  will  provide  periodic  updates  on \nproject components that focus on improving preventive health services for ethnic minorities. The \nmidterm review mission will pay special attention to the effects of project components on ethnic \ngroups. Adjustments, if necessary, will be made to the EMDP during project implementation. \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 9 \n\n43\n\nGENDER STRATEGY \n\nBackground \n\n \n1. \nThe  Preventive  Health  Systems  Support  Project  provides  significant  health  benefits  for \nabout 29 million women in the 46 project provinces of Viet Nam, of which about 8.3 million are \nethnic  minority  women.  A  gender  strategy  has  been  prepared  to  highlight  the  different \npreventive health needs of men and women in Viet Nam. It also helps to ensure that both men \nand women have equal opportunities to participate in training at all levels. The gender strategy \nis  based  on  a  situational  analysis  and  assessment  that  was  prepared  for  the  Project,  and  is \ndesigned  in  accordance  with  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  policy  on  gender  and \ndevelopment. \n \nA. \n \n2. \nWomen  compromise  about  51%  of  the  total  population  in  the  46  project  provinces. \nGender  division  of  labor  typically  adheres  to  a  strict  division  between  the  roles  of  men  and \nwomen.  Traditionally  \u201cwomen\u2019s  work\u201d  consists  of  taking  care  of  domestic  chores,  reproductive \nand family care, and activities related to hygiene and sanitation. In preventive and health care \npractices in the household, women play a specific role in the care of common diseases based \non  local  experience  and  traditional  knowledge.  They  also  play  an  important  role  in  food \npreparation,  cooking,  family  diet,  and  household  living  arrangements.  However,  many  women \noften  lack  control  over  household  income  and  decisions  about  seeking  health  care  for \nthemselves and their children, even those from ethnic groups that maintain strong matrilineal or \ntraditions (i.e., Ede, and Hmong groups). \n \nB. \n \n3. \nIn Viet Nam, the burden of disease is similar for men and women. However, the patterns \nof  disease  differ.  Women  are  vulnerable  to  diseases  associated  with  reproduction  and \nchildbearing, while men suffer a greater burden of disease from accidents and injuries. Similarly, \nthe  burden  of  disease  is  higher  for  women  than  men  in  certain  geographical  locations.  For \ninstance, in the central highlands the burden of disease for females of reproductive age (15\u201344) \nis  more  than  25%  higher  than  the  national  average.1  The  lack  of  knowledge  about  women\u2019s \nrights,  and  prevalence  of  traditional  custom  law  and  practices  also  negatively  affect  women\u2019s \nhealth and development (i.e., early marriage, and limited decision-making). \n \n4. \nWomen  and  children  in  some  ethnic  groups,  bear  a  health  burden  that  is  substantially \nhigher  than  those  of  better-off  communities.  Women  and  child  health  is  hampered  by  limited \naccess  to  preventive  and  curative  services,  misuse  of  self-medication,  and  lack  of  trust  in \nmodern medicine hamper. Ministry of Health (MOH) guidelines for safe delivery indicate having \nat  least  three  prenatal  exams,  taking  iron  supplements,  immunization  against  tetanus,  and \nmonitoring  weight  regularly.  However,  because  childbirth  is  viewed  as  a  natural  phenomenon, \nmany women pay little attention to safe motherhood care. The Vietnam National Health Survey, \n2001\u20132002  survey  found  that  among  reproductive  aged  women  (18\u201334  years),  prenatal  care, \nand  immunization  in  ethnic  minority  groups  was  1.5  times  lower  than  that  for  the  Kinh \npopulation. \n\nWomen\u2019s Burden of Disease \n\n                                                 \n1  This is measured in disability-adjusted life years, a common measure used to aggregate the burden of disease.  \n\n\f44 \n\n \n\nAppendix 9 \n\n \n\nProvince \n\nHa Tay \nBac Ninh \nHai Duong \nHung Yen \nHa Nam \nHa Giang \nCao Bang \nLao Cai \nBac Kan \nLai Chau \nSon La \nThanh Hoa \nNghe An \nQuang Tri \nThua Thien Hue \nTay Ninh \nBinh Duong \nDong Nai \nBinh Thuan \nBa Ria-Vung Tau \n\n4,436 \n2,009 \n3,598 \n\u2014 \n\u2014 \n2,666 \n\u2014 \n2,076 \n1,063 \n2,056 \n2,741 \n7,341 \n6,773 \n2,004 \n1,970 \n2,536 \n1,885 \n3,869 \n\u2014 \n\u2014 \n\nGender and the Public Health Sector \n\nC. \n \n5. \nThe gender division of labor within  the public health sector is clearly defined based on \nqualifications  and  professional  skill.

Training  will  be  provided  in \nsurveillance and management for preventive health staff at all levels, and in developing human \nresources  within  the  preventive  health  system.  The  Project  will  improve  human  resources \nthrough technical training and postgraduate training.  \n \n7. \nThe Project will also provide training to district and commune health staff on improving \nthe quality of women and child preventive care and reducing common communicable diseases \nwithin  families.  This  local  training  will  be  supported  in  17  of  46  provinces,  which  will  receive \nproject  support  for  implementing  the  national  target  programs  in  health  (NTPs).  Information, \neducation  and  communication  (IEC)  activities  and  training  materials  that  will  be  developed  (or \nimproved based on existing materials) will take into consideration the special needs of men and \nwomen. All qualified staff will have an equal opportunity to participate in training programs at all \nlevels, regardless of sex.  \n \n8. \nrequire a review of the following activities: \n\nA need assessment will confirm equipment and training needs of each province, and will \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 9 \n\n45\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nreview  proposed  project  activities  against  the  incidence  of  communicable  and \nnoncommunicable diseases by gender and by ethnic group;  \nprioritize  training  courses  for  health  staff  in  each  province  based  on  population \ncomposition,  available  health  staff,  health  patterns,  health  needs,  and  epidemic \nprograms; and determine if addition training courses are required;  \nidentify any special training support and appropriate learning methods for health \nstaff  to  improve  service  delivery  of  preventive  health  services  to  women  and \nmen;  these  needs  will  be  based  on  individual  preventive  health  needs  and  will \nvary in each province; and \nidentify ways in which district and commune health staff may help to strengthen \nthe  surveillance  system  in  the  province  so  that  diseases  can  be  tracked  by \ngender and by ethnic groups.  \n\n \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nE. \n \nImplementation arrangements and estimated costs of the gender strategy are part of the \n9. \noverall  project  arrangements  and  total  budget,  as  women  are  among  the  Project\u2019s  primary \nbeneficiaries. A national health specialist will be hired for 10 person-months during the Project \nto  help  execute  the  gender  strategy  in  project  activities  during  implementation.  The  specialist \nwill  take  into  account  local  conditions  and  arrangements  specific  to  each  province  when \nimplementing the strategy, and will work closely with the other health specialists for the Project.  \n \n10.  Monitoring  of  the  gender  strategy  is  incorporated  in  the  overall  system  for  the  Project. \nWhere appropriate, both women and men will be consulted in the design and implementation of \nIEC activities and training materials for preventive health services. Progress reports will provide \nperiodic  updates  on  project  components  with  respect  to  gender  (i.e.,  number  of  women  that \nparticipated in different trainings). The midterm review mission will review these updates against \nthe  proposed  gender  strategy.  Adjustments,  if  necessary,  will  be  made  to  the  gender  strategy \nduring project implementation. \n \n \n\n\f46 \n\n \n\nAppendix 10 \n\n \n\nPROJECT COST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING PLAN \n \nTable A10.1 Project Cost Estimates by Component and Financing Source \n($'000) \n\n \n\nItem \n\n \n\nSubtotal (A) \n\n1.

The  consulting  group  will  report  directly  to  the  project \ndirector. The terms of reference for the consultants are contained in Appendix 14. \n \nD. \n \n4. \nMedicine and HIV/AIDS Control (DPH) will actively support the PMU.  \n \n5. \nThe  Department  of  Science  and  Training.  The  Project  Cell  established  in  DST  will \nfocus  on  planning,  designing,  and  implementing  the  Project\u2019s  training  activities  in  preventive \nhealth.  In  many  cases,  the  curriculum  and  programs  already  exist  and  DST  will  design  the \ncriteria  for  selection  of  candidates  for  training  in  coordination  with  the  consulting  group.  If \nnecessary,  DST  will  work  with  the  consulting  group  to  improve  curriculums  and  programs  to \nbetter address the needs of target populations such as ethnic minorities, women, and children.

The  Project  Cell \nestablished in DPH will focus on implementation of the health surveillance system (Component \nA.1) and quality of services and support to combat priority communicable diseases (Component \nA.2) through the provision of technical support.  \n \nE. \n \n7. \nProvinces. The provincial health service is responsible for implementation of the Project \nat the provincial level. The director of the provincial health service will be the provincial project \ndirector and the director of the provincial preventive health service will be the provincial deputy \nproject  director.  Each  province  will  have  a  provincial  steering  committee  to  provide  overall \ntechnical guidance. Each province will also establish a small project implementation unit (PIU) \nthat  will  have  several  staff  to  support  planning,  administration,  and  implementation  of  the \nProject. The provinces have the following responsibilities:  \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\ndevelop  a  needs  assessment  for  the  provincial preventive  health  center  and  for \ncommunicable  disease  control  (for  selected  provinces)  for  review  by  the \nconsulting group and the PMU; \ncarry  out  local,  small-scale  procurement  of  goods  and  supplies  necessary  to \nadminister  the  Project locally,  including  managing  the  provincial  project  account \nand utilizing statement of expenditure procedures;    \nensure that equipment procured and training provided by the Project are properly \nutilized by the province, based on the needs assessment;  \noperate  health  surveillance  and  provide  information  to  the  Project  as  required; \nand \nimplement community and local training.  \n\n \n8. \nNational Institutes.

Studies have shown the importance of health in fostering economic growth \nand  household  welfare.  Poor  health  is  a  leading  cause  of  poverty  in  Viet  Nam  as  many \nhouseholds are forced to drain their savings to pay for expensive medical bills while the income \nfrom  members  who  are  unable  to  work  is  lost.1  Thus,  well-targeted  investment  can  improve \nequity and efficiency within the economy.  \n \n2. \nThe  economic  rationale  for  public  investing  in  preventive  health  is  compelling.  The \npreventive  health  system  in  Viet  Nam  provides  many  services  that  are  true  public  goods,2 \nincluding  communicable  disease  surveillance  and  control  of  large-scale  epidemics.  The \npreventive  health  system  also  spends  significant  resources  in  providing  the  public  with \ninformation about good health practices. Without public intervention, many preventive activities \nwould not be carried out since individuals or the private sector have little incentive to invest at \nthe socially optimal level in these activities.  \n \n3. \nWhile  many  preventive  health  activities  are  private  in  nature  (such  as  immunization  or \nperiodic  medical  check-ups),  they  are  likely  to  have  significant  benefits  to  the  community \n(positive externalities). Because households tend to take into account only their private benefits \nand  not  the  benefits  to  the  community,  they  are  likely  to  underinvest  in  preventive  health. \nHowever,  other  factors  lead  to  a  low  level  of  private  investment  in  preventive  health.  They \ninclude  lack  of  information  about  the  immediate  and  long-term  benefits  of  preventive \ninvestments.  Even  with  proper  information,  households  often  do  not  have  the  means  to  make \npreventive  investments,  due  to  lower  income  and  credit  constraints.  Subsidies  of  preventive \nhealth service can help to ensure demand is appropriate. Public provision or subsidies can also \nhelp generate economies in scale in production and distribution of preventive health services.  \n \nB. \n \nImproved Health Status. The Project will improve the health status of the population in \n4. \nthe Project\u2019s provinces. The general population will benefit from the preventive health system\u2019s \nimproved  capacity  to  monitor  food  and  environmental  quality.  The  Project  will  also  benefit  a \nnumber of specific groups, including school children through improved school health programs, \nand  mothers  through  the  community-based  preventive  health  training.  The  population  in  17 \nprovinces with high incidence of communicable diseases, with a total population of 14.8 million, \nwill benefit from the Project\u2019s focus on strengthening communicable disease control (CDC).  \n \nThe  private  benefit  from  the  Project  can  be  measured  in  terms  of  the  population\u2019s \n5. \nimproved health. Burden of disease analysis is a tool that allows the total morbidity and mortality \nof a community to be expressed in one measure, called a disability adjusted life year (DALY). \nThis analysis captures the loss of quality of life due to an illness or disability and the loss of life \n\nEconomic Benefits of the Project \n\n                                                 \n1  This  double  shock  caused  by  poor  health  is  well  documented  in  World  Bank.  1999.  Voice  of  the  Poor:  Vietnam \n\nCountry Report. Washington, DC.  \n\n2  A public good is a good that cannot be produced for individual profit. From an individual\u2019s point of view, once the \ngood  is  produced,  there  is  no  scarcity  of  the  good  (nonrivalry)  and  everybody  can  benefit  from  it.  It  is  also \nimpossible to prevent access or consumption of the good (nonexcludability).  \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 16 \n\n59\n\ndue to a premature death. These losses can be attributed to individual diseases, accidents, and \ninjuries.  \n \n6. \nThe  analysis  estimated  the  total  number  of  DALYs  lost  due  to  41  diseases  that  the \nProject will impact in the 46 project provinces. These diseases account for around one third of \ntotal  mortality.  The  analysis  calculated  the  expected  change  in  DALYs  without  the  Project, \ntaking  into  account  the  country\u2019s  expected  demographic  changes.  The  Project  is  expected  to \nreduce  the  burden  of  disease  through  its  support  for  investment  in  food  safety,  school  health, \nimproved  occupational  safety  and  health,  and  strengthened  disease  control  programs  in \nselected provinces, among other interventions. This will reduce the DALYs lost and improve the \nhealth  of  the  population.  The  analysis  made  an  estimate  of  the  number  of  DALYs  saved  as  a \nresult of the Project\u2019s specific interventions, from the base case scenario with no project.  \n \n7. \nBased on this analysis, the Project is expected to save about 2.0 million DALYs during \nthe  estimated  life  of  the  equipment  at  a  total  cost  of  $47.5  million,  including  the  cost  of \nmaintenance, supplies, and personnel. This implies a cost per DALY around $23.75, which is in \nline  with  other  preventive  health  programs  in  low-income  countries.3  The  poor  will  benefit \ndisproportionately from the Project. The analysis shows that around 38% of the total benefits, in \nterms  of  DALY,  will  accrue  to  the  poor,  compared  with  their  share  of  around  12.8%  in  the \npopulation of the Project\u2019s provinces.  \n \n8. \nLower  Spending  on  Curative  Care.  If  DALYs  were  not  saved,  the  diseases  would \nresult in substantial cost of treatment as well as travel expenditures and the opportunity cost of \nthe  caregiver.  Using  results  of  the  National  Health  Survey  of  2002\u20132003,  the  total  savings  in \nspending on curative care are estimated to be $60.7 million, which is greater than the Project\u2019s \ncosts. Based on these savings, the internal rate of return of these investments is 16%. This rate \nof  return  calculation  only  captures  the  private  benefits  of  the  Project.  The  rate  will  be \nsubstantially higher if the value of the positive externalities and public goods are included.  \n \n9. \nImproved Health Surveillance System. The Project will improve the health surveillance \nsystem  through  additional  facilities,  training,  and  supervision.  Viet  Nam\u2019s  recent  experiences \nwith  SARS  and  avian  flu  show  the  importance  of  a  strong  health  surveillance  system  and  the \npotential economic and social damage that can be caused by not monitoring the progress of the \ndiseases.  Strengthening  the  health  surveillance  system  will  allow  the  faster  detection  of \nepidemics,  provide  better  details  of  disease  patterns,  and  allow  better  planning  and  setting  of \nhealth priorities. The health surveillance system is a classic public good that will not be provided \nby the market.  \n \nC.  \n \nFor the Project to achieve the rate of returns, the Government must be able to sustain \n10. \nthe  Project\u2019s  investments.  If  the  Government  is  not  able  to  provide  the  necessary  recurrent \nexpenses  to  complement  the  Project\u2019s  investment,  the  effectiveness  of  the  Project  will  be \nreduced. Likewise, at the end of the Project, the Government should be in a position to continue \nthe programs and initiatives that the Project introduces. \n \n11.  Macroeconomic Sustainability. The Project is financed by a loan of approximately $28 \nmillion  and  a  complementary  grant  of  $10  million.  The  loan  carries  an  interest  rate  of  1%  to \n\nEconomic and Financial Sustainability \n\n                                                 \n3  World  Bank.  1993.

The  economy  of  Viet  Nam  is  growing  at  a  rate  of  around  7%  and  this  rate  is  likely  to \ncontinue.  The  economy  of  Viet  Nam  is  around  $40  billion  and  the  Government  will  be  able  to \nrepay the loan.  \n \nProject  Sustainability.  In  addition  to  capital  expenses,  the  Project  will  lead  to  an \n12. \nincrease  in  recurrent  costs  on  the  part  of  the  Government.  These  expenses  are  due  to  the \nadditional  operational  and  maintenance  costs,  additional  salaries  for  staff  with  higher  level  of \ntraining, and additional staff. These costs will be largely borne by provinces, with subsidies for \npoor provinces.  \n \n13. \nOn average from 1997 to 2002, the provincial health budgets have increased 2.9 times \nfaster than the growth of the provincial gross domestic product, with a range of 7% to 33% and \naverage  annual  growth  rate  of  18%.4  Recurrent  expenses  account  for  around  75%  of  total \nexpenditures  and  have  grown  at  a  similar  rate  to  overall  health  expenditures.  The  simulation \nassumes  that  in  the  future,  recurrent  budget  in  the  provincial  health  budget  grows  at  only  7% \nannually,  which  is  very  conservative  given  recent  trends.  The  additional  costs  associated  with \nthe  Project  will  only  account  for  less  than  10%  of  the  total  increase  in  the  provincial  health \nbudgets  and  will  account  for  less  than  2%  of  the  total  recurrent  budget  in  2013.  The  costs \nassociated with the Project can easily be met.  \n \nNot  all  provinces  have  the  same  capacity  and  some  provinces  may  have  financing \n14. \nproblems, either due to a high level of recurrent costs associated with the Project or a low level \nof health expenditures. A provincial simulation shows that no province will have to spend more \nthan  20%  of  the  total  increase  in  its  recurrent  budget  to  support  the  Project\u2019s  investment  and \nonly  15  provinces  will  have  to  allocate  more  than  10%.  By  2013,  only  2  provinces  will  see \nrecurrent costs associated with the Project that require more than 10% of the growth in the total \nrecurrent budget.  \n \nIn addition to the recurrent costs associated with the Project, the provinces will also have \n15. \nto  increase  their  capital  budgets  in  the  long  run  to  replace  the  new  equipment  that  was \npurchased under the Project. On average, $500,000 is allocated to each province for equipment \nand  training.  By  2014,  the  capital  budget  of  all  of  the  provinces  will  have  increased  by  an \naverage of $1.9 million per province over the amount in 2005. Only 11 provinces will see their \ncapital budget increase by less than $1 million by 2015. All provinces should be in a position to \nreplace the equipment purchased and to increase their budget for training by project completion.  \n \nThe Project will also complement the recurrent costs in 17 poor provinces. The support \n16. \nto the national targeted programs amounts to around $30,000 per province per year. While this \namount can make an important contribution if applied strategically, it will account for than 3% of \nthe 2006 recurrent budget in all provinces. By the end of the Project, all of the provinces should \nbe in a position in replace the Project\u2019s support for CDC.  \n\n                                                 \n4 This analysis only refers to the 46 provinces included in the project scope.  \n\n\f", "author_pages": ["CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 15 July 2005)  \n", "Currency Unit\n", "dong (D) \n", "\u2013 \n", "= \n= \n", "D1.00\n$1.00\n", "$.00006301 \nD15,870 \n", "ABBREVIATIONS \n", "ADB \nADF \nCDC \nDALY \nDST \nEMDP \nEMP \nHICH \nHIV/AIDS \nIEC \nIEE \nMOH \nNTP \nPHC \nPIU \nPMU \nSARS \nSGIA \nSIEE \nTB \nVDG \nWHO \n", "Asian Development Bank \nAsian Development Fund \ncommunicable disease control \ndisability adjusted life year \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013  Department of Science and Training \n\u2013 \nethnic minority development plan  \nenvironmental management plan \n\u2013 \n\u2013  Health Care in the Central Highlands \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013  Ministry of Health \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013  World Health Organization \n", "national targeted program \npreventive health center \nproject implementation unit \nproject management unit \nsevere acute respiratory syndrome \nsecond generation imprest account \nsummary initial environmental examination \ntuberculosis \nViet Nam development goal \n", "NOTES \n", " \n", " \n", " \n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n", " \n", "human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome \ninformation, education, and communication \ninitial environmental examination \n", "The fiscal year of the Government and its agencies ends on 31 December.  \n", "In this report, \"$\" refers to US dollars. \n", "(i) \n", "(ii) \n \n \n \n \n", "This report was prepared by a team consisting of E.
