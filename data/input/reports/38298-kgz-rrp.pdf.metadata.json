The  Project  has  four  components: \n(i) consolidation of the PVE system, (ii) improving teaching and learning \nenvironments, (iii) modernization of curriculum and assessment and \ndevelopment  of  learning  materials,  and  (iv)  human  resource \ndevelopment.  \n   \nRationale  The  economy  in  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  is  recovering  and  forecasts \nproject an average GDP growth of 7.5% for the period 2006\u20132010. \nWhile the Government is set to improve the enabling conditions for \nprivate  sector  growth,  lack  of  skilled  labor  is  a  key  issue  for  the \nbusiness  community.  In  line  with  economic  growth  projections, \nfeedback from employers confirm the strong demand for quality skilled \nlabor particular for (i) service sectors, including tourism, information \ntechnologies and repair services; (ii)  construction related occupations, \nincluding electricians, welders, plumbers, carpenter, and bricklayers; \nand (iii) non-mining industries.  \n \nThe current vocational education system that is largely based on the \nformer Soviet system, is neither responsive to labor market demands \nnor cost-effective. While there is a growing need for skilled workers in \nthe  formal  and  informal  labor  market,  graduates  from  vocational \nschools have difficulty finding jobs because they lack employable skills. \nThe key issues of the current vocational education system are (i) poor \nlinkages to the labor market, which results in poor quality and relevance \nof  training  courses,  (ii)  lack  of  practical  training  and  hands-on \nexperience for students, (iii) weak learning and teaching environment in \nschools, (iv) underutilized facilities and inefficient staff deployment, and \n(v) inefficient management of schools. \n \nIn addition, the current system performs poorly in terms of providing \nrelevant quality skills training for adults and out-of-school youth. Most \nadults, particularly the poor in rural areas lack access to skills training \nthat  enhances  earning  capacity.  At  present,  the  provision  of  skills \ncourses to train and retrain adults is limited to a small number of skill \nareas mainly in urban areas. Only a few private training providers are \nengaged in vocational education and skills training.  ", "ii \n  In order to address the mismatch in the labor market the Project will \nassist the Government in (i) creating flexible mechanisms with active \nindustry  participation  to  regularly  adapt  training  programs  to  new \nbusiness circumstances, (ii) preparing flexible graduates who are able \nto adjust to changing demands in the labor market quickly, and (iii) \nconsolidating the current primary vocational education (PVE) system.  \n \nA consolidated and modernized PVE system will improve utilization of \nfacilities and ensure a more efficient deployment of staff. Reorganized \nPVE  schools  with  efficient  staff  structures  will  be  more  flexible  to \nrespond to changing demands of labor market. The project will promote \nan entrepreneurial approach to managing schools and program delivery \nin order to (i) increase income generation through marketing of short \nterm skills training courses, selling of services and production of basic \ngoods,  and  (ii)  provide  an  environment  for  students  which  will \ndemonstrate the principles of entrepreneurship. \n \nAsian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB) assistance to the education sector in \nthe Kyrgyz Republic has evolved since the mid 1990s to support the \nGovernment  in  different  stages  of  reforming  and  strengthening  the \ngeneral education system. The Project is the first intervention in the \nvocational education sector. By reforming the current PVE system to \nbecome  demand-driven  and  efficient,  the  Project  will  assist  the \nGovernment in complementing the transition of the education system \nfrom  the  Soviet  model  to  a  system  that  is  responsive  to  the \nrequirements  of  a  market-based  economy  and  consistent  with  the \ninternationally accepted education standards. \n   \nImpact and Outcome  The impact of the Project will be improved employability and income-\nearning opportunities of graduates from PVE. The project outcome is \nmore equitable access to and improved quality and relevance of PVE. \n   \nCost Estimates  The total project cost is estimated at $13 million equivalent.  \n   \nFinancing Plan  ($ million) \nSource              Total          Percent \nAsian Development Bank                 10.00               77 \nGovernment of the Kyrgyz Republic                   3.00               23 \n  Total                 13.00             100 \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nTo further support project activities, Germany development cooperation \nthrough Deutsche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Technische Zusammenarbeit (GTZ), \nand the Swiss Association for International Cooperation (HELVETAS) \nhave indicated that they would provide additional consulting inputs on a \ngrant basis. \n   \nGrant Amount   ADB will provide a grant of $10.0 million from ADB\u2019s Special Funds \nresources  to  finance  77%  of  the  total  project  cost.  The  remaining \n$3.0 million (23%) will be provided by the Government.  \nPeriod of Utilization  Until 30 September 2011 \n   \nEstimated Project  31 March 2011 \nCompletion Date ", "iii \n   \nExecuting Agency  The Executing Agency (EA) will be the Ministry of Labor and Social \nProtection (MLSP). \n   \nImplementation  The EA will appoint the project director who will coordinate the overall \nArrangements  implementation of project activities. A project steering committee (PSC) \nwill  be  established  to  provide  strategic  guidance  and  monitor  the \nimplementation of the Project. The PSC will be chaired by the Vice \nPrime Minister of the Kyrgyz Republic and consist of representatives of \nMLSP, Ministry of Economy and Finance, Office of the Prime Minister, \nChamber of Industry and Commerce, Confederation of Employers, and \nthe Civil Association Forum of Education Initiatives. The PSC will meet \nquarterly, or as often as required.  \n \nThe Project will be implemented through a project implementation unit \n(PIU), staffed by a project manager, a procurement specialist, a finance \nspecialist,  a  monitoring  and  evaluation  (M&E)  specialist,  an \nadministrative assistant, an accountant, and part-time interpreters. The \nproject manager will be responsible for the overall implementation of \nproject activities. The PIU will report to the project director and provide \nquarterly progress reports to the PSC, EA, and ADB.  \n   \nProcurement  Goods, works, and related services financed by ADB will be procured in \naccordance with its Procurement Guidelines (April 2006, as amended \nfrom time to time). Procurement of civil works will be carried out through \nnational  competitive  bidding.  Procurement  of  equipment  will  be \nperformed  through  international  competitive  bidding,  national \ncompetitive  bidding,  and  shopping.  Before  commencement  of \nprocurement,  ADB  and  the  recipient  will  review  the  recipient\u2019s \nprocurement procedures to ensure consistency with ADB requirements. \nAny necessary modifications or clarifications to the recipient procedures \nwill be documented in the procurement plan. \n   \nConsulting Services  A total of 35 person-months of international and 107 person-months of \nnational consulting services will be contracted from grant funds under \nthe four components. This will include experts in the field of vocational \neducation  and  skills  development  (VESD)  policy  development, \norganizational  development,  curriculum  and  standards  development, \nentrepreneurship  promotion,  development  of  learning  materials, \nprocurement  of  training  equipment,  labor  market  assessment,  and \nlegislative  reform.  Consultants  will  be  recruited  in  accordance  with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (April 2006, as amended \nfrom time to time).  \n   \nProject Benefits and  The  Government  is  instituting  a  number  of  reforms  to  improve  the \nBeneficiaries  business climate, and create a supportive enabling framework for the \nprivate sector. Transforming the current PVE system\u2014from one that is \nsupply-driven  and  inefficient  to  one  attuned  to  labor  market  needs, \ncapable  of  producing  better  equipped  and  skilled  workers,  and \nproviding training and retraining opportunities for out-of-school youth \nand  adults\u2014will  complement  the  Government\u2019s  strategic  thrust  to \npromote private sector growth. \n \nDirect beneficiaries of the Project will include all students enrolled in \n ", "iv \nPVE  schools.  Nationwide,  about  24,300  students  (including  about \n10,000  students  from  poor  families)  will  benefit  from  new  demand-\noriented  training  programs,  modern  student-centered  teaching \ntechniques, and practical hands-on training in rehabilitated workshops. \n \nAt the end of the Project, more than 6,000 adults and out-of-school \nyouth will benefit from relevant short-term skills training provided by \nvocational schools.  \n \nAbout 1,300 instructors, 500 teachers, and 200 school managers will \nbenefit from staff development programs conducted under the Project. \n \nThe  combined  effects  of  the  following  will  ensure  cost-effective \nimprovements  in  providing  VESD  services:  (i)  restructuring  and \nrationalizing the current PVE system, which will result in reduction of \nexpenditures and more efficient utilization of funds, infrastructure, and \nhuman  resources;  and  (ii) applying  an  entrepreneurial  management \napproach  that  will  increase  revenue  generation  at  school  level. \nEstablishing strong links with industry/employers will make certain that \ntraining courses will be relevant, and increase job chances and income \nopportunities for graduates \n \nLabor force entrants who graduate from modernized PVE schools will \npossess  knowledge  and  skills  in  line  with  market  requirements, \ncontribute  to  higher  labor  productivity,  and  increase  private  sector \ngrowth. \n   \nRisks and  Successful implementation of the Project rests on the assumption that \nAssumptions  the Government will (i) maintain the high commitment to reform the \nPVE system and approve the strategy to consolidate the current school \nstructure; (ii) ensure that \u201cefficiency gains\u201d through consolidation and \nschool  mergers  will  be  kept  within  the  system  and  be  utilized  for \nincentive  schemes  for  instructors  and  teachers,  purchase  of \nconsumables required to conduct practical training, and investment in \nnew  equipment;  (iii)  provide  adequate  budget  for  operation  and \nmaintenance of rehabilitated schools; and (iv) in-service training for all \ninstructors. To  achieve  its  impact,  the  Project  assumes that  further \nsteady economic growth will create new job opportunities. \n \nProject  risks  include  (i)  limited  institutional  capacity  of  the  EA,  (ii) \nresistance  of  school  staff  in  the  process  of  restructuring  the  PVE \nsystem,  and  (iii)  adequate  provision  of  funds  for  operation  and \nmaintenance (O&M). \n \nThe  managerial  and  technical  capacities  of  the  MLSP  and  PVE \ninstitutions are limited and might affect the smooth implementation of \nthe consolidation strategy. The risk will be mitigated through capacity \nbuilding within the Department of Vocational Education and Training \n(DVET) under the MLSP. At the school level, the Project will strengthen \nmanagement capacities of school principals and provide training for \ninstructors, curriculum developers and teachers. \n \n ", "v \n  The  impact  of  school  mergers  and  the  introduction  of  a  new \nentrepreneurial culture and uniform assessments, will be significant. \nRisks include resistance from instructors, teachers and school directors \nto  accept  changes.  The  risks  will  be  mitigated  by  adopting  a \nparticipatory approach to project implementation that actively involves \nschool directors, instructors, and teachers.  \n \nFinancial  risks  involve  potential  difficulties  in  the  provision  of \nincremental recurrent costs for operation and maintenance (O&M) of \nrehabilitated schools. To mitigate risks of insufficient public funds for \nO&M, the Project\u2019s strategy aims at reducing the dependency on public \nallocations  through  promoting  an  entrepreneurial  approach  and \nstrengthening income generation at PVS level. \n ", "(cid:111) (cid:111)\n(cid:55)(cid:49)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:48)(cid:48)(cid:39)(cid:69)

THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed grant \nto the Kyrgyz Republic for the Vocational Education and Skills Development (VESD) Project.  \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n \n2.  In 2004, the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic requested the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) to provide technical assistance (TA) to support reforming and modernizing the current \nsystem  for  primary  vocational  education  and  prepare  the  VESD  Project  (the  Project).1  In \naccordance with the Government\u2019s development strategy, the Project is included in the country \nstrategy and program update 2006\u20132008.2 The project design and monitoring framework is in \nAppendix 1. \n \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n \n1.  Socioeconomic Context \n \n3.  In 2003\u20132005, annual economic growth was 4.4% on average, per capita gross domestic \nproduct (GDP) increased from $384 to $475, and real incomes of population have grown over the \nlast 3 years by 5% on average. However, about 37% of the population still lives below the \nnational poverty line ($225 per year) and about 13% are considered to be extremely poor (income \nless than $140 per year). The experience of the Kyrgyz Republic suggests that economic growth \ndoes not immediately translate into poverty reduction; the benefits of GDP growth are not equally \ndistributed among the population, as revealed by income inequality. \n \n4.  In 2005, the estimated population of the Kyrgyz Republic was about 5.1 million, with a \npopulation growth rate of about 1.1%. The Kyrgyz Republic has a relatively young, economically \nactive population\u2014about 56% of the total population is of working age and 45% of the population \nis from 5 to 19 years of age. Over the next 4 years, about 115,000 to 120,000 young people per \nyear will enter the labor market, which will need to absorb an additional 4% of the working age \npopulation.3 At the same time, despite economic growth, registered unemployment rose to 10% in \n2005. However, official data provide only a partial picture of the unemployment problem; more \ncomprehensive figures suggest that the unemployment rate is almost 20% of the workforce. As in \nother former Soviet economies, a large number of those without work do not register themselves \nas  unemployed,  given  the  negligible  benefits  available  and  limited  usefulness  of  state \nunemployment services. The number of underemployed could be even higher, given that many \npeople who are technically \u201cemployed\u201d are actually working part-time in the informal sector. \nUnemployment among youth remains one of the most problematic issues\u2014over 50% of the \nunemployed are under 30 years old. \n \n5.  The collapse of public industries after 1991, combined with lack of access to effective \nsocial security payments and lack of formal employment opportunities, has contributed to the \nemergence of a widespread informal sector in the Kyrgyz Republic. Based on the Household \nSurvey carried out by the National Statistical Committee in 2004, it is estimated that more than \n50% of the economically active population is employed or self-employed in the informal sector, \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2005. Technical Assistance to the Kyrgyz Republic for Preparing the Vocational Education and Skills Training \nProject. Manila. \n2  ADB. 2005. Country Strategy and Program Update (2006\u20132008): Kyrgyz Republic. Manila. During the Country \nStrategy and Programming (CSP) Mission in October 2005, the Government and ADB agreed to finance the ensuing \nproject from grant funds. \n3  About 24,000 workers per year will exit the labor market during the same period. ", "2 \nmainly engaged in agriculture and trade-related activities. Employment in the agriculture sector is \ndisproportionately high. While agriculture contributes only one third of GDP, around 50% of the \nworkforce was employed in the sector in 2004.  \n \n  2.   Education Sector \n \n6.  The education system in the Kyrgyz Republic follows the Soviet model and comprises \n(i) pre-schooling; (ii) 11 years of general education, including primary education from grades 1\u20134, \nlower  secondary  from  grades  5\u20139,  and  upper  secondary  education  from  grades  10\u201311; \n(iii) primary vocational education (PVE); (iv) secondary vocational education (SVE); and (v) higher \neducation. Primary and lower secondary education is compulsory. The constitution stipulates free \nbasic education (grades 1\u20139) to all children. In 2003, net enrollment was 98.6% in primary grades \nand 72.2% in upper secondary grades. The Ministry of Education (MOE) is responsible for setting \neducation policy and standards in general education, and controls implementation through oblast \n(province) and raion (district) departments of education. The structure of the education system is \nin Appendix 2. \n \n7.  The Kyrgyz Republic has two separate systems of vocational education: PVE and SVE. \nSVE is provided by various ministries and agencies, which offer programs at the post-school level \nbut below the level of higher education. The SVE institutions do not represent a \u201csystem\u201d in the \nsame way as the other sectors of education. In total, 70 institutions offer SVE programs4 and \nabout 27,000 students were enrolled in 2005. No comprehensive tracer studies are available but \nanecdotal evidence suggests that a large number of SVE graduates have difficulties finding \nemployment after course completion. Linkages among SVE institutions and between SVE, PVE, \nand industry are weak. A comprehensive VESD policy\u2014linked to a national human resource \ndevelopment plan and to present and future labor market needs\u2014is not in place. \n \n  3.  Primary Vocational Education \n \n8.  The PVE system was developed under the Soviet era to become a principal training \nnetwork for skilled workers, and was well linked to industry needs. Many primary vocational \nschools (PVSs) were located next to large factories and specialized in providing qualified workers \nfor particular trades. At its height, the PVE system provided training for up to 90,000 students. \nHowever, after 1991, PVE has become one of the most neglected areas of education in the \nKyrgyz Republic. The Government reduced its support significantly\u2014funds for operation and \nmaintenance  and  reinvestment  in  training  equipment  decreased,  buildings  deteriorated,  and \nenrollment fell substantially. \n \n9.  At present, the PVE system is administered by the Department for Vocational Training \nand Education (DVTE) under the Ministry of Labor and Social Protection (MLSP), and consists of \n112 PVSs. In 2005, 24,148 students were enrolled in PVSs, of which 36% were female students. \nAccording  to  DVTE  data,  about  10,000  students  are  from  low-income  families.  Anecdotal \nevidence and surveys in rural areas suggest that the number of poor students is much higher, \nand up to 70% of PVE students belong to poor families. Currently, PVSs offer three types of \ncourses: (i) three-year programs combine a vocational specialty with general education, providing \nstudents with the necessary certificate to study further in a higher education institution. More than \nhalf of PVE students are enrolled in the 3-year program; (ii) two-year programs are designed for \n                                                 \n4  Sponsors of SVE institutions include: MOE (22 SVE institutions), Ministry of Health (10), State Commission on \nCulture (9), Ministry of Labor and Social Protection (MLSP) (3), Kyrgyz Union of Consumers (2), Ministry of \nEconomics and External Trade (1), State Commission Tourism and Sports (1), Ministry of Interior (1), Ministry of \nTransport (1), Association of Cooperatives (1), SVE institutes attached to Higher Education Institutions (11), and \nprivate institutions (8). ", "3 \nstudents from grade 9 and provide vocational education with some general education, but this \nprogram does not provide the general education components required for higher education; and \n(iii) 10-month courses that strictly target vocational skills, and are marketed to both youth and \nadults. In addition, some PVSs offer short-term skills courses for adults, mainly sponsored by the \nEmployment Services. However, in 2005, only about 500 adults were enrolled in short courses. A \ndescription of the PVE system is in Appendix 3. \n \n10.  Public expenditure on education has been on average about 4% of GDP for the past \n3 years (4.12% in 2005). PVE\u2019s share of the education budget is low\u20146.6% in 2005.5 In 2005, \n45% of the PVE budget was spent on salaries and allocations to the social fund; 31% for social \nprotection, including school food and student allowances; 11% for heating, electricity, water \nsupply, and other utilities; and only 13% remained for operation and maintenance (O&M) of \nschool facilities, provision of training materials, and investment in new equipment. In 2005, about \n12% of the total budget was generated by schools\u2019 income earning activities of schools. This was \nmainly spent on incentive schemes for instructors and teachers to improve their low salaries, and \nthe  purchase  of  urgently  needed  consumables  and  materials  for  training  courses.  The \nGovernment has indicated that it will increase PVE funding during 2006\u20132008. However, its \ncommitment to meet salaries and provide social protection will continue to absorb most of the \nannual PVE budget. A description of PVE financing is in Appendix 4. \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n \n  1.  Key Issues and Challenges \n \n11.  Reform Context. Private sector growth and the level of investments are both rising in \n2006. After the 2005 political turmoil that led to a fall of 0.6% in GDP, the economy is recovering; \nestimates by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the Ministry of Economy and Finance \nforecast average GDP growth of 7.5% for the period 2006\u20132010. According to these projections, \nthe construction sector is expected to grow annually at 13% on average, industry production \n(excluding mining) at 9.4%, service sector at 8.2%, and agriculture at a slower pace of 4.5%. To \nstimulate  sustainable  economic  growth  further  and  create  employment  opportunities,  the \nGovernment has launched a series of reforms, including improving governance, introducing a flat \ncorporate and personal income tax, simplifying tax administration, improving access to financial \nservices, streamlining operational licensing, and strengthening the enforcement of contracts.  \n \n12.  Dynamic Labor Sectors. While the Government is set to improve the enabling conditions \nfor private sector growth, lack of qualified personnel is a key issue for the business community. In \nthe absence of reliable labor market information and employment forecasts, possible information \non  skill  requirements  was  gathered  through  focus  group  discussions  with  local  employers, \nfarmers,  and  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs)  at  raion  level;  and  feedback  from  the \nChamber  of  Industry  and  Commerce  and  its  regional  offices,  National  State  Committee  for \nMigration and Employment (NSCME) and its oblast offices, and MLSP. In line with economic \ngrowth  projections,  the  feedback  from  employers,  NGOs,  NSCME,  and  chamber  members \nconfirmed the strong demand for quality skilled labor in the service and construction sectors and \nnon-mining  industries.  The  construction  sector  is  expected  to  grow  in  line  with  the  rapid \ndevelopment  for  new  housing  and  increased  road  construction.  Quality  skilled  workers  in \nconstruction-related occupations will be in demand, including electricians, welders, plumbers, \ncarpenters, and bricklayers. The service sector, accounting for 45% of GDP, will account for \nsubstantial job growth. Employment potential and income earning opportunities are expected in \n                                                 \n5  In 2005, the total budget for PVE was at about $7.9 million\u2014$6.9 million through public allocations and $1.0 million \nfrom income generation from schools. \n ", "4 \nskill areas related to repair of vehicles and home appliances. Tourism is estimated to expand \nfollowing the success of the Government in attracting a growing number of visitors annually, and \nrecent  developments  of  the  tourist  infrastructure.  Job  growth  will  be  concentrated  in  food \nservices, hotel management, recreation, and entertainment activities. IT-service industries are \nexpected to grow over the medium term, stimulating jobs for office and management services. \nIncreased  demand  for  telecommunications  services,  Internet  connections,  and  software \napplications will further stimulate job opportunities among these industries. Industry production \n(excluding mining) will require broad skilled labor in small and medium-sized enterprises.6 The \nGovernment also highlights the potential of the textile sector, which provides additional income \nearning opportunities in rural areas. Increases in population and personal income will contribute \nto employment growth in retail trade, as consumers demand more goods. \n \n13.  While by far the largest source of employment, the capacity of the agriculture sector to \ncreate additional employment is limited. To improve productivity and income opportunities in the \nsector, workers will need to diversify and upgrade their skills in agro-processing. A growing \nnumber of workers engaged in farming activities are seeking retraining opportunities to acquire \nskills to improve employability in other sectors. Many school graduates will seek jobs or self-\nemployment  opportunities  in  the  informal  sector  because  of  limited  formal  employment \nopportunities. The ability to be flexible, identify business opportunities, and respond to local labor \nmarket  demands  in  a  timely  manner  will  increase  their  income  prospects.  Entrepreneurial, \nmultiskilled labor will have comparative advantages. \n \n14.  Poor Quality and Relevance. Feedback from employers revealed that the current PVE \nsystem is not able to respond adequately to emerging labor market needs. Many PVE graduates \nand most unemployed lack practical skills required by enterprises, and up-to-date knowledge in \ntheir  areas  of  specialization;  and  do  not  have  sufficient  understanding  of  entrepreneurial \nprinciples. Graduates who have found employment have had to undergo additional training by \ntheir  employers.  Anecdotal  evidence  revealed  that,  in  small  towns  and  villages,  qualified \nplumbers,  electricians,  and  welders  are  not  available;  construction  companies  need  to  hire \nlaborers from abroad because of lack of qualified national workers; and tourism and IT companies \ncomplain about under-qualified PVE graduates and unfit job applicants. The quality and relevance \nof PVE programs suffers from weak interaction with the private sector and lack of systematic \nlabor market research. Although some PVSs have developed good linkages with local companies \nand provide relevant skills training, the majority of training programs are largely supply-driven and \noften based on allocated budgets and available staff and equipment rather than market demand.  \n \n15.  Poor  Facilities.  The  essence  of  vocational  education  and  skills  training  is  relevant \npractical training and hands-on experience for students. However, poor infrastructure and lack of \nadequate training equipment in most PVSs mean that students learn about skills in theory but are \nnot able to put those skills into practice. The building construction and technology of PVSs which \nhave  not  yet  benefited  from  rehabilitation  measures  are  based  on  30-year  old  construction \nstandards  that  are  inefficient  in  terms  of  use  of  materials,  structural  capacity,  and  energy \nperformance. PVS facilities continue to deteriorate because of inadequate maintenance and \ninvestment. Training workshops and dormitories are in poor condition. Most training equipment in \nPVSs was supplied during the Soviet era and is outdated or not functioning and only displayed for \ndemonstration  purposes.  Hand  tools,  sufficient  consumables,  teaching  aids,  and  learning \nmaterials are lacking in training workshops.  \n \n16.  Qualification of Instructors and Teachers. The teaching techniques and technical skills \nand knowledge of most instructors and teachers are outdated and need to be upgraded. Many \n                                                 \n6 The share of small and medium sized enterprises in the GDP grew to 47% in 2005. ", "5 \ninstructors focus on delivering content, as specified in their curriculum, and not on achieving the \nperformance expected for employment. Under the Soviet system, teachers received periodic in-\nservice training, which has since diminished because of limited resources.  \n \n17.  Curriculum Development and Learning Materials. Industry involvement in curriculum \ndevelopment  is  limited  and  current  curriculum  modules  are  not  revised  regularly  to  reflect \nchanging technology and market demands. The curriculum needs to be adjusted to incorporate \nstudent-centered, modern teaching methods with emphasis on practical training. To enhance the \nflexibility of graduates to respond to labor market demands in a timely manner, a modernized \ncurriculum  should  aim  at  providing  multi-skills  training  and  include  entrepreneurial  skills. \nTextbooks and learning and teaching materials are seriously outdated. A new, decentralized \napproach in training material development\u2014involving teachers, instructors, and experts from the \nprivate  sector\u2014is  required  to  produce  modern  learning  materials  for  students,  promoting \nindependent learning and practical workshop experience.  \n \n18.  Weak Assessment. Currently, there is no comprehensive assessment system based on \nagreed skills standards in place. The quality of skills training depends on the quality of instruction, \nwhich is often adversely affected by lack of training equipment, poor teaching environment, and \noutdated knowledge of teachers. Schools set their own examination, without formal external \nquality control or moderation. At present, industry is only involved occasionally in preparing and \nparticipating in examinations.  \n \n19.  Low Efficiency. The average size of PVSs, in terms of enrollments, is very small. This \nraises  a  number  of  issues.  The  PVE  system  was  originally  designed  for  90,000  students. \nHowever,  many  classrooms,  training  workshops,  and  dormitories  are  largely  underutilized \nbecause of the sharp decrease in enrollment. Schools with low enrollment have considerably \nhigher training unit costs than schools with higher student enrollment. Because of lack of an \nassets management strategy and restrictive legal and administrative regulations, DVTE is not in a \nposition to manage its complex range of assets efficiently. The staff composition of the PVE \nsystem  is  inefficient.  Senior  staff  is  too  thinly  spread  and  the  ratio  of  nonteaching  staff  to \nadministrative and management staff is unbalanced\u2014of about 7,400 staff engaged in PVS, only \nabout 20% are skill instructors and 13% are general education teachers; the remaining 67% are \nmanagers, administrators, and support staff. Consolidation of the current system is necessary, \nincluding merging selected PVSs, to improve utilization of facilities and ensure more efficient \ndeployment of staff. Reorganized and consolidated PVSs with efficient staff structures will be \nmore flexible to respond to changing demands of the labor market. \n \n20.  Training Provision for Adults. The current system performs poorly in terms of providing \nmarket-oriented skills training for adults and out-of-school youth. Most adults, particularly the poor \nin rural areas, lack access to skills training that would enhance their earning capacity. Relevant \nshort-term training programs are offered in a limited manner by public training institutions and a \nfew private providers, mainly in urban areas. Currently, no skills development strategy is in place \nto address adult training and retraining needs. \n \n2.  Government Policy \n \n21.  The Comprehensive Development Framework (CDF), Millennium Development Goals for \neducation,  and  Country  Development  Strategy  for  2007\u20132010  currently  under  preparation, \ndescribe the Government\u2019s development strategy. The overarching goal of the CDF is to achieve \npolitical and social well-being, economic prosperity of the people of the Kyrgyz Republic, together \n ", "6 \nwith  freedom,  human  dignity,  and  equal  opportunities  for  all.7  The  Government  considers \nreforming the current PVE system an integral part of its (i) economic growth strategy, aimed at \nsteady, private sector-led growth; (ii) social strategy, aimed at improving access of the poor to \nincome generating opportunities; and (iii) approach to remove disparities between rural and urban \nregions and improve living conditions in rural areas. \n \n22.  The Law on Education, the Education Development Concept until 2010, and the National \nAction Plan on Education for All (EFA) describe the Government\u2019s policy and strategies in the \neducation sector. Strengthening vocational education and developing an adult education and \ntraining system are considered key development areas in the National Plan of Action on EFA. \n \n3.  External Assistance to the Sector \n \n23.  ADB has been the major development partner in the education sector since the mid-\n1990s. Complementing ADB\u2019s support to the education sector, the World Bank provided a grant \nof $15.5 million in 2005 to support rural basic education. The Organization of the Petroleum \nExporting Countries (OPEC) Fund supported initial improvements of general education services. \nThe  United  States  Agency  for  International  Development  (USAID)  supports  legal  reforms, \ncapacity building, improvement of selected curriculum areas, teacher training, and community \nparticipation  in  rural  basic  education.  The  Soros  Foundation  supports  teacher  training  and \nlearning development and overseas scholarships. The United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF) \nprovides assistance in capacity development of local administrators and policy development in \ngeneral  education.  The  United  Nations  Educational,  Scientific  and  Cultural  Organization \n(UNESCO) promotes the EFA strategy. Save the Children supports nonformal education for poor \nchildren. With the exception of the assistance provided by ADB and the World Bank, inputs by \nthese  agencies  have  been  relatively  modest  in  financial  terms  and  mainly  target  general \neducation. \n \n24.  The  major  development  partners  in  vocational  education  are  Swiss  Association  for \nInternational Cooperation (HELVETAS) and German development cooperation through Deutsche \nGesellschaft  f\u00fcr  Technische  Zusammenarbeit  (GTZ).  Swiss  Association  for  International \nCooperation (HELVETAS) has been active in agricultural training and supports selected PVSs in \nrural areas. It has developed a large number of excellent training materials; and provides training \nfor teachers, instructors, and school principles on modern teaching methods and entrepreneurial \nmanagement approaches. Germany (GTZ) has provided support to PVE since the end of the \n1990s. GTZ focuses on curriculum development for selected trades, supports the establishment \nof a national policy framework for VESD, and promotes training and retraining opportunities for \nadults. In addition, the International Labour Organization (ILO) has developed an entrepreneurial \ntraining package which has been piloted at some PVSs.  \n \n4.  ADB\u2019s Sector Strategy \n \n25.  ADB\u2019s country strategy and program update (2006\u20132008) highlights the importance of \nreducing  poverty  by  promoting  private  sector-led  economic  growth  and  human  resource \ndevelopment,  including  promoting  general  and  vocational  education.  ADB  assistance  to  the \neducation  sector  in  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  has  evolved  since  the  mid-1990s  to  support  the \nGovernment in different stages of reforming and strengthening the education system. Assistance \nincluded program and project loans for the Education Sector Development Program8 approved in \n1997, which supported policy reforms and initial improvements in delivering education services. \n                                                 \n7  Kyrgyz Republic. 2001.

", "7 \nBuilding on lessons and achievements from the Education Sector Development Program, the \nSecond Education Project9 was approved in 2005. The Second Education Project supports the \nGovernment\u2019s efforts in modernizing the curriculum, strengthening teacher training, promoting \nincentive schemes for teachers in rural areas, and rehabilitating and upgrading rural schools. The \nSocial Services Development and Finance Project,10 approved in 1998, provided support for \nrehabilitating education and health facilities in Jalal-Abad and Osh oblasts. The Community-\nBased  Early  Childhood  Development  Project,11  which  was  approved  in  2003,  focuses  on \nimproving health, nutrition, and educational development for children below 8 years of age in the \n12 poorest raions of the country.  \n \n26.  The VESD Project is ADB\u2019s first intervention in vocational education. The Project\u2019s focus \nis consistent with ADB\u2019s Policy on Education.12 Activities are aimed at reducing poverty and \nproviding knowledge and skills essential to meet the needs of a demand-driven modern economy. \nThe  Project  will  address  unemployment  issues  caused  by  a  mismatch  between  existing \nknowledge and skills and labor market needs, which is considered a major cause of poverty. \n \n5.  Lessons \n \n27.  Reform  of  the  current  PVE  system  will  complement  ADB\u2019s  development  assistance, \nsupporting the Government in completing the transition of the education system from the Soviet \nmodel to a modern demand-driven system consistent with internationally accepted education \nstandards and labor market needs. As this is ADB\u2019s first intervention in the vocational education \nsector, the project design takes into consideration experiences from other development partners, \nparticularly GTZ and HELVETAS, that indicate the urgent need to (i) consolidate and rationalize \nthe existing PVE structure; (ii) launch an entrepreneurial culture in school management and \ndelivery  of  training  programs;  (iii)  introduce  new  teaching  techniques  and  upgrade  training \nworkshops  and  equipment  to  strengthen  practical,  hands-on  training;  and  (iv)  involve \ncommunities and employers to strengthen the quality and relevance of training programs. Another \nlesson relates to the importance of donor coordination to generate synergies. The project design \nwill  involve  key  development  partners  in  steering  and  coordination  committees  to  improve \nharmonization and information sharing.  \n \nIII.   THE PROPOSED PROJECT \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n28.  The  impacts  of  the  Project  will  be  improved  employability  and  income-earning \nopportunities of graduates from PVE, and strengthened private sector-led economic growth. The \nexpected project outcome is more equitable access to and improved quality and relevance of \nvocational education and skills training. \n \nB.  Outputs \n \n29.  The Project has four components: (i) consolidation and modernization of the PVE system, \n(ii)  improving  teaching  and  learning  environments,  (iii)  modernizing  curriculum  and  learning \nassessment and developing learning materials, and (iv) human resource development. \n                                                 \n9  ADB. 2005.

Reforming the current PVE system toward a demand-driven, entrepreneurial system with \nactive industry participation that will provide relevant programs to youth and increase training and \nretraining opportunities for adult and out-of-school youth is the major feature of the Project. Under \ncomponent 1, the Project will provide assistance in (i) consolidating and modernizing the current \nPVE structure gradually; (ii) creating a legal and administrative framework conducive to enable \nschool  management  to  engage  in  entrepreneurial  activities  and  administer  their  assets  and \nincome; and (iii) developing a national policy framework for VESD linking PVE, SVE, and private \ntraining provision. The Project will address policy issues to enhance the contribution of private \ntraining provision by creating incentives and ensuring that the regulatory framework does not \nraise unreasonable barriers to entry. \n \n31.  Consolidation  and  Restructuring.  The  Project  will  support  the  Government  in \ndeveloping and implementing a strategy to consolidate assets and staff structure of the current \n112 PVE schools. Based on a comprehensive review of the existing school structure, labor \nmarket assessments, and enrollment trends, \u201ccomplex schools\u201d13 will be established by merging \nselected schools. PVSs that will not participate in mergers will be restructured to enhance the \nefficiency and improve the relevance and quality of training programs. A reformed system will \nimprove  utilization  of  existing  classrooms,  training  workshops,  dormitories,  and  equipment; \nensure  more  efficient  deployment  of  staff;  and  strengthen  training  provision  in  rural  areas. \nInternational and national consultants will provide support in developing and implementing a \nstrategy to consolidate the PVE system step-by-step, including reforming legal, regulatory, and \nadministrative arrangements. \n \n32.  To improve the flexibility of the PVE system to adjust training programs to changing \nrequirements of the labor market in a timely manner, the Project will assist MLSP in strengthening \nlabor market research and employment forecasts. Results of labor market assessments will be \nregularly reviewed by the NSCME, Chamber of Industry and Commerce, and selected industry \nrepresentatives to guide curriculum development. Arrangements to establish a regular review \nmechanism will be formalized within 6 months of grant effectiveness. To further strengthen the \nrelevance and quality of training programs, complex schools and other PVSs will establish school \nadvisory boards consisting of local employers and civil society representatives. Advisory boards \nwill (i) guide school management in developing annual business plans, (ii) support schools in \nidentifying  skill  demands  and  adjusting  training  programs  accordingly,  (iii)  participate  in  the \nmoderation  of  training  courses  and  examinations,  and  (iv)  promote  on-the-job  training  and \napprenticeship opportunities. The Project will provide support in preparing detailed procedures for \nthe operation of advisory boards, which will be formalized by MLSP within 6 months of grant \neffectiveness. \n \n33.  Currently, DVTE has at its disposal a complex range of assets, including buildings, land, \nand  equipment.  Much  of  the  equipment  is  not  functioning  or  outdated;  many  buildings  are \nunderutilized and have major defects. The Project will help to improve the management of these \nresources, and assist in setting up an assets management system and legal and administrative \nframework which will allow selling, renting out, or closing down assets, with proceeds to be used \nwithin the PVE system.  \n \n                                                 \n13 A \u201ccomplex school\u201d will consist of a number of merged schools under one management, with infrastructure and staff \non a shared basis. ", "9 \n34.  Entrepreneurial Culture. At the school level, the Project will promote an entrepreneurial \napproach to managing schools and program delivery to (i) increase income generation through \nmarketing short-term skills training courses for out-of-school youth and adults, selling services, \nand producing basic goods; and (ii) provide an environment for students that demonstrates the \nprinciples of entrepreneurship. Students who will seek jobs in the informal sector or as self-\nemployed, will benefit from a learning environment that practices and teaches entrepreneurship. \nThe Project will (i) provide training to school principals and administrators to strengthen their \nmanagement capabilities; (ii) support instructors to adjust training programs based on demand \nassessments;  and  (iii) assist curriculum  developers,  instructors,  and  teachers  to  incorporate \nentrepreneurial  skills  in  curriculum  modules.  The  Project  will  help  to  revise  administrative \nregulations to allow PVSs to manage income for the benefit of their schools. \n \n35.  Certification. As part of the modernization process, the Project will provide support to \nestablish a certification scheme with appropriate mechanisms for skills assessments. Certificates \nwill  be issued  to students  and  workers  who will  pass  examinations  and  skills assessments \nconducted jointly with the private sector. Assessment centers will be established at selected \ncomplex schools.  \n \n36.  Career Guidance. The Project will support the establishment of mechanisms to inform \nstudents  from  grades  9  to  11  and  their  parents  about  income  earning  and  employment \nopportunities of PVE graduates. A professional media company will be engaged to prepare and \nconduct awareness campaigns. A time-bound action plan will be developed during the first year \nof project implementation. Qualified staff from MLSP and selected teachers and instructors from \nschools will be trained in counseling methods and networking with employers. \n \n37.  Skills Training and Retraining for Adults. At present, the provision of skills training \ncourses to train and retrain adults and out-of-school youth is limited to a small number of skill \nareas  and  offered  by  only  a  few  training  providers,  mainly  in  urban  areas.  To  promote \nemployment and income earning opportunities for unemployed and underemployed adults and \nyouth, the Project will provide support in increasing the availability of relevant short-term skills \ntraining courses. Based on the results of labor market surveys and employment forecasts, the \nProject will assist in developing short-term courses to be conducted at complex schools and \nPVSs during evenings, weekends, and school holidays. The Project will also develop strategies to \nstimulate private training provision.  \n \n2.  Component 2:  Improving Teaching and Learning Environments in PVSs  \n \n38.  Once an approved consolidation strategy is in place, the Project will provide assistance to \nimprove the teaching and learning environment in schools. This will include (i) rehabilitation and \nupgrading  of  training  workshops  of  up  to  20  selected  PVSs,  (ii)  rehabilitation  of  up  to \n20 dormitories, and (iii) provision of training equipment for basic priority skill areas14 that offer the \nbest employment prospects for students. The Project will also provide 14 mobile training units to \nservice remote rural areas. \n \n39.  Rehabilitation priorities include: (i) provision of adequate heating systems and insulation; \n(ii) improvement of roof structures; (iii) repair of sanitation systems; (iv) repair of defective walls \nand ceilings; and (v) replacement of damaged floors, doors, windows. To improve access for \ndisabled students who may have faced exclusion, rehabilitation works will include provision of \nfacilities  for  wheelchair-bound  students,  adjusted  and  accessible  furniture,  equipment,  and \n                                                 \n14 Skills areas include: (i) agriculture, (ii) basic IT services, (iii) automotive, (iv) carpentry, (v) welding, (vi) electrical, \n(vii) metalwork, (viii) garments, and (ix) hospitality. \n ", "10 \nimproved sanitary facilities. To improve teaching conditions, the Project will provide teaching aids \nto each rehabilitated workshop. School management and community members will be involved in \nthe planning of rehabilitation works, and participate in the day-to-day supervision to make certain \nthat contractors implement rehabilitation works as specified in the contracts. \n \n40.  Once the consolidation strategy is approved, packages of new training equipment will be \nprovided  to  selected  PVSs,  including  equipment  for  (i)  benchwork,  (ii)  carpentry,  (iii)  basic \ninformation  and  communication  technology  (ICT),  (iv) construction  works  (masonry  and \nbricklaying), (v) agriculture, (vi) cooking, (vii) electrical and electronics, (viii) heavy and light \nvehicle repair, and (ix) welding (arc and gas). To start practical training, each rehabilitated and \nupgraded training workshop will be provided with a lump sum for consumables and materials to \nsupport the first year of its operation. In the following years, schools will finance procurement of \nconsumables and materials from their own income generation. \n \n41.  The selection mechanism to identify schools for rehabilitation and training equipment will \nbe based on a competitive and demand-oriented approach. Schools will be invited to submit a \nproposal, including a business plan, that will provide information on (i) planned training courses, \nnumber of potential participants, and income earning opportunities for skills trained; (ii) availability \nof  qualified  teachers  and  instructors;  (iii)  partnership  arrangements  with  local  industry  and \npotential employers; (iv) plans for utilization of training workshops and new equipment; and \n(v) availability of adequate funding for consumables and O&M costs. Based on the results of labor \nmarket research and employment forecasts, MLSP will undertake its own analysis and make \nproposals to optimize facilities and equipment, ensure that training programs will meet current \nand future demands, and guarantee that students from poor families will benefit.  \n \n42.  Within 2 months of grant effectiveness, MLSP will establish a selection committee that will \nreview proposals received from schools and select schools for inclusion in the Project. The \ncommittee will consist of five members, including one representative each from DVTE, MLSP, \nChamber of Industry and Commerce, civil society, and development partners. The key criterion \nfor the selection of schools will be the potential impact of the training courses on the employability \nand  income  earning  opportunities  of  students.  The  final  selection  of  schools,  scope  of \nrehabilitation  works,  and  equipment  packages  will  be  submitted  by  MLSP  to  ADB  for \nconcurrence. National and international consultants will provide support in identifying adequate \ntraining  equipment  and  prepare  technical  specifications  for  the  tenders.  To  support  the \npreparation of tender documents for rehabilitation works and supervise all civil works, the Project \nwill provide budget to engage an engineering consulting firm. \n \n43.  Mobile training workshops will be provided to serve schools not covered under the Project, \nparticularly schools in remote villages, and will be based in and managed by a complex school to \nbe chosen by the selection committee. The mobile training workshop will be equipped with \ntraining equipment for priority basic skills areas that will be identified during the first year of \nproject implementation. Further administrative arrangements for operation of the mobile training \nworkshops will be agreed by the selection committee. \n \n3.  Component 3:  Modernizing the Curriculum and Learning Assessment and \nDeveloping Learning Materials \n \n44.  The Project will help develop a competency-based and modularized curriculum15 with \nrelated skills and education standards. Curriculum modules will be refocused on the demand of \n                                                 \n15 A competency-based training system will emphasize on students\u2019 abilities to perform tasks at a specified proficiency \nlevel according to industry standards, and provide a wide range of opportunities for students to practice and acquire \nskills and knowledge to become competent skilled workers. ", "11 \nthe formal and informal labor market. The new curriculum will foster a student-centered learning \napproach and ensure that practical training is embedded into training programs. The revised \ncurriculum  will  aim  at  producing  multiskilled  graduates.  Curriculum  modules  will  incorporate \nentrepreneurial principles to prepare students for self-employment and jobs in the informal sector. \nThere are three interrelated activities under this component: (i) revision of the current curriculum, \n(ii) development and production of teaching and learning materials, and (iii) development of \nassessment guides. \n \n45.  Curriculum Modernization. The Project will provide resources to upgrade the capacity of \nDVTE to manage the process of curriculum revision. The Project will assist in establishing expert \ngroups consisting of curriculum developers, selected school instructors, and subject experts from \nthe private sector. The expert groups will assess current skill standards and revise curriculum \nmodules in the following vocational areas: (i) agriculture,16 (ii) construction, (iii) basic IT services, \n(iv) automotive, (v) carpentry, (vi) electrical, (vii) metalwork, (viii) garments, and (ix) hospitality. \nThe new curriculum will integrate entrepreneurship development in all vocational areas to train \nstudents to understand the principles and practices of entrepreneurship. The Project will support \non-the-job and apprentice schemes as integral parts of the curriculum to enable students to \nacquire relevant skills, knowledge, work discipline, and real work experience. The Project will \nprovide training to instructors to prepare lessons and instructional material according to the \nrevised curriculum and implement competency-based curriculum modules. \n \n46.  Material Development. The development of teaching and learning materials will follow a \ndecentralized approach. Selected complex schools with strengths in particular training areas will \nbe nominated as centers for material development in their area of specialization. The Project will \nprovide an equipment package for each of the nominated complex schools. Based on the revised \ncurriculum and supported by consultants and graphic designers, expert groups\u2014consisting of \ninstructors, specialists from the private sector, and curriculum developers\u2014will prepare learning \nmaterials. Once the preparation of specific course materials has been completed, it will be made \navailable through the internet for downloading and printing at each school. Additional printing and \ndistribution of materials will be arranged through tendering. All tenders will comply with ADB \nProcurement Guidelines (April 2006, as amended from time to time) as the basis for procurement. \n \n47.  Learning Assessment. Currently, there is no agreed national examination system in \nplace. The Project will provide assistance to introduce a uniformed assessment system with \nemphasis  on  skills  tests  and  practical  examinations,  in  addition  to  theoretical  exams. \nExaminations will be prepared and conducted by instructors and subject specialists from the \nprivate sector. The Project will provide support to assist school management, teachers, and \ninstructors to improve (i) the quality of theoretical assessments; and (ii) the preparation of skill \ntests and practical examinations, which will include developing an examination items data bank. \n \n4.  Component 4:  Human Resource Development \n \n48.  Component 4 will consolidate training needs which arise in the process of reforming the \nPVE system. Based on a comprehensive human resources development plan and related training \nneeds  assessments,  training  activities  will  include  (i)  DVTE  staff,  (ii)  school  management, \n(iii) schools instructors and teachers, and (iv) a specialist for curriculum and training material \ndevelopment. \n \n                                                 \n16 HELVETAS has developed high quality curriculum and teaching/learning materials, which are used in pilot schools, \nfor the agriculture sector. The Project will integrate lessons from HELVETAS in the curriculum and material \ndevelopment process to roll out successful materials nationwide. \n ", "12 \n49.  Strengthen  Professional  Development  for  Instructors.  The  Project  will  assist  in \nestablishing an in-service training system which will provide continuous training opportunities for \ninstructors,  with  focus  on  student-centered  teaching  approaches  and  practical  training  for \nstudents. International and national consultants will train and supervise a group of 60 core \ntrainers who will, in turn, conduct training programs for instructors to improve teaching methods \nand assessment techniques. Special emphasis will be given to entrepreneurial approaches in \nteaching. Core trainers will be given 3 weeks of training and equipped with manuals. Training \nprograms will be conducted at complex schools and will include all instructors currently in service. \nDVTE will assign a team to plan, organize, and follow up on training programs with the support of \nthe project implementation unit (PIU). \n \n50.  Strengthen Management Capacities. To promote an entrepreneurial culture in schools, \nthe Project will provide training for school management and selected DVTE staff on assets \nmanagement, financial management, basic IT skills, development of business plans, and human \nresources development planning. Financed by the Project, training will be conducted by national \nand international consultants and private training providers. The Project will establish a system to \nprovide regular management support and follow-up training measures for school principals and \nadministrators. DVTE will identify suitable national training providers and develop criteria to select \ntrainees. \n \n51.  Curriculum  and  Material  Development  and  Assessment  Methods.  Supported  by \ninternational and national consultants, capacity will be built throughout the PVE system to ensure \nregular update of training modules and continued provision of learning materials. Selected groups \nof  skill  specialists  will  receive  on-the-job  training  in  curriculum  design  and  development  of \nmaterials. Training programs will be conducted at schools to introduce new assessment methods. \nIn addition to in-service training conducted by core trainers and private training providers, the \nProject will provide support to establish a training platform based on ICT, which will offer updated \ninformation on education content, modern pedagogy, and reference and learning materials. The \nIT capacity of complex schools will be strengthened to provide additional options for teachers and \ninstructors to engage in interactive self-learning.  \n \nC.  Special Features \n \n52.  The  Project  has  two  key  strategies  to  address  the  mismatch  in  the  labor  market: \n(i) creating flexible mechanisms with active industry participation to adapt training programs to \nnew business circumstances regularly, and (ii) preparing flexible graduates who are able to adjust \nto changing demands in the labor market quickly.  \n \n53.  To adjust training programs to changing demands of the formal and informal labor market \nin a timely manner, the Project will support MLSP in strengthening labor market research and \nemployment forecasts and involve private sector participation at all levels. At the national level, \nlabor market research results and training programs will be regularly reviewed by the Chamber of \nIndustry and Commerce, civil society organizations, and selected business associations. At the \nschool level, advisory boards will be established, comprising local employers and NGOs, to \nprovide guidance on the local skill demand and review school training programs. Industry and \nNGOs will participate in the project steering committee (PSC) and be involved in the selection \ncommittee to identify schools to be included in the Project. Skill specialists from companies will \nparticipate  in  curriculum  development,  learning  material  design,  and  learning  assessments; \ncompanies will provide opportunities for on-the-job training and apprentices schemes. \n \n54.  The combined effects of restructuring and rationalizing the current PVE, and applying an \nentrepreneurial management approach, will ensure cost-effective improvements within the current \nbudget  allocation.  Adopting  an  entrepreneurial  approach  to  managing  schools  and  program \ndelivery  will  create  an  environment  for  students  that  demonstrates  the  principles  of ", "13 \nentrepreneurship. Graduates who will seek jobs in the informal sector or as self-employed will \nbenefit from a learning environment that practices and teaches entrepreneurship. Becoming more \nentrepreneurial will enable schools to increase income generation and reduce dependency on \npublic allocations.  \n \n55.  In broadening the scope of the PVE system\u2014by introducing short-term skills courses\u2014the \nProject will contribute to provide training and retraining opportunities for numerous youth who \nhave left school without marketable skills, and unemployed and underemployed adults who are \nseeking job opportunities. Active industry participation in the design of short courses will ensure \nthat training programs are demand-driven, and will improve the employability of trainees.  \n \nD.  Project Investment Plan \n \n56.  The total project cost is estimated at $13.0 million equivalent. Project cost estimates by \nexpense category are in Table 1. Detailed cost estimates are in Appendix 5. \n \nTable 1: Project Investment Plan \n($\u2019000) \nItem  Total Cost\nA.   Base Cost \n  1.

Financing Plan  \n \n57.  The  Government  has  requested  a  grant  of  $10  million  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds \nresources to finance 77% of the total project costs. The remaining $3.0 million, or 23% of the total \nproject cost, will be provided by the Government. The financing plan is in Table 2. \n \nTable 2: Financing Plan \n($ \u2018000) \nSource                        Total                                       Percent \nAsian Development Bank  10,000  77 \nGovernment   3,000  23 \nTotal  13,000  100 \nNote: Government financing is included in the budget and consists of taxes and duties; contributions of \nmanagers, teachers, instructors, and administrators within the PVE system; provision of workshop and office \nfacilities; and contingencies. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n ", "14 \n \n58.  To further support project activities, Germany (GTZ) has indicated that it will provide \nadditional consulting inputs on a grant basis in the areas of development of a VESD policy \nframework, entrepreneurial training, curriculum revision, and development of short-term skills \ntraining courses for adults. HELVETAS has indicated that it will provide consultancy inputs on a \ngrant basis to strengthen school management and promote material development and teacher \ntraining related to agriculture. \n \n59.  Grant Financing. The Kyrgyz Republic is one of the poorest countries in Asia, facing \nserious debt stress. The Project is closely aligned with ADB\u2019s poverty reduction strategy and the \nGovernment\u2019s  country  development  strategy  (\u0421DS).  The  CDS  overall  objectives  include \nimprovement of living standards by achieving sustainable economic growth, creation of conditions \nfor full employment, providing high and stable incomes, and availability of a wide spectrum of \nsocial services. Since more than 50% of students enrolled in PVE schools are from low-income \nfamilies, and the vast majority of adults participating in training and retraining programs are \nexpected to be unemployed or underemployed, the Project will contribute directly to poverty \nreduction through increasing income generation opportunities. While public funding is expected to \nbe sufficient to cover recurrent expenditure of the PVE system, it is unlikely that the Government \nwill be able to finance the urgently needed rehabilitation and modernization of PVE facilities from \nits own resources. Given the high level of capital investment needs, grant financing of the Project \nwill ease the costs of external financing.  \n \nF.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n1.  Project Management \n \n60.  The Executing Agency (EA) of the Project will be MLSP. The EA will appoint the project \ndirector  who  will  coordinate  the  overall  implementation  of  project  activities.  A  PSC  will  be \nestablished to provide strategic guidance and monitor the implementation of the Project. The PSC \nwill be chaired by the Vice Prime Minister of the Kyrgyz Republic and consist representatives of \nMLSP, Ministry of Economy and Finance, Office of the Prime Minister, Chamber of Industry and \nCommerce, Confederation of Employers, and the Civil Association Forum of Education Initiatives. \nOP will identify one industry and one NGO representative. The PSC will meet quarterly, or as \noften as required. GTZ and HELVETAS will participate as observers in the PSC. \n \n61.  The  Project  will  be  implemented  through  a  PIU,  staffed  by  a  project  manager,  a \nprocurement specialist, a finance specialist, a monitoring and evaluation (M&E) specialist, an \nadministrative assistant, an accountant, and part-time interpreters. The project manager will be \nresponsible for the overall implementation of project activities. Office space for the PIU will be \nprovided within DVTE. The PIU will report to the project director and provide quarterly progress \nreports to the PSC, EA, and ADB.  \n \n2.  Implementation Period \n \n62.  The Project will be implemented over 4 years from March 2007 to March 2011.  \n \n3.  Procurement \n \n63.  All ADB-financed civil works, goods, and related services will be procured in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (April 2006, as amended from time to time). Civil works will \ninvolve rehabilitation of existing facilities, but there will be no construction of new facilities. Civil \nwork contracts will be less than $1.0 million. National contractors are capable of carrying out all \nrehabilitation works, so civil work contracts estimated to cost $1.0 million or less will be procured ", "15 \nthrough  national  competitive  bidding  (NCB)  procedures  acceptable  to  ADB.  Before \ncommencement  of  NCB  procurement,  ADB  and  the  recipient  will  review  the  recipient\u2019s \nprocurement  procedures  to  ensure  consistency  with  ADB  requirements.  Any  necessary \nmodifications or clarifications to the recipient\u2019s procurement procedures will be documented in the \nprocurement plan. \n \n64.  The  Project  will  provide  training  equipment,  computer  and  related  ICT  equipment, \nteaching  aids,  classroom  furniture,  learning  materials,  and  manuals.  Equipment  and  goods \nestimated to cost more than $500,000 will be procured under international competitive bidding \nprocedures. Equipment and materials estimated to cost $500,000 or less will be procured under \nNCB procedures acceptable to ADB. Learning materials and other equipment and materials \nvalued at $100,000 or less will be procured by shopping. Before the commencement of any \nprocurement activity under NCB procedures, ADB and the Government will review the public \nprocurement law to ensure consistency with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines. Any necessary \nmodifications or clarifications will be reflected in the procurement plan. The Government has \nprepared a procurement plan for the initial 18 months (Appendix 7). The procurement plan \nincludes (i) particular contracts for the goods, works, and related services required to carry out \nthe Project, (ii) proposed methods for procuring contracts that are permitted under the grant \nagreement,  and  (iii)  related  ADB  review  procedures.  The  Government  will  update  the \nprocurement plan annually or as needed throughout project implementation. \n \n4.  Consulting Services \n \n65.  All consulting services will be recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants (April 2006, as amended from time to time). Under the four project components, a \ntotal of 35 person-months of international and 107 person-months of national consulting services \nwill be contracted, financed by ADB funds. International and national consultants financed from \nADB funds will be recruited as a firm under quality and cost-based selection methods, using full \ntechnical proposals. In addition to consultants contracted through a firm, the Government has \nrequested  advance  recruitment  of  one  individual  international  organizational  development \nspecialist and one individual national legal specialist. The Government has agreed to recruit \nindividual national consultants for the PIU in accordance with ADB\u2019s procedures for recruiting \nindividual consultants. Consulting services under the four components will include experts in the \nfield of (i) organizational development, (ii) legal advice, (iii) management information system, (iv) \ncareer guidance, (v) equipment selection and procurement, (vi) curriculum and training material \ndevelopment, (vii) graphic design, (viii) teacher training, and (ix) entrepreneurship. In addition, the \nProject provides budget for engaging (i) an engineering consulting firm, (ii) an IT consulting firm, \nand (iii) national training providers. The outline terms of reference and a personnel schedule for \nthe project consultants are in Appendix 8. \n \n5.   Anticorruption Measures \n \n66.  ADB\u2019s  policy  on  Anticorruption  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was  explained  to  and \ndiscussed  with  government  officials.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance, \naccountability, and transparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its \nagents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive or coercive practices relating to the Project. To \nsupport these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s policy on Anticorruption are included in the \ngrant regulations and the bidding documents for the Project. In particular, all contracts financed \nby ADB in connection with the Project shall include provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit \nand examine the records and accounts of the EA and all contractors, suppliers, consultants, and \nother service providers as they relate to the Project. \n \n ", "16 \n6.  Capacity Building, Staff Development, and Training \n \n67.  The Project will provide in-country training to upgrade the skills and knowledge of selected \nstaff from the EA, school managers and administrators, instructors, and teachers. The EA will \nprepare the selection criteria for training candidates for ADB approval. The PIU will provide ADB \nwith (i) a list of nominated candidates, (ii) proposed training institutions, and (iii) detailed costing \nof the proposed training programs. Training measures to upgrade the capacities of instructors will \nbe conducted by international and national consultants and a group of core trainers. The Project \nwill  finance  national  and  international  consultants  to  design  and  conduct  training  programs. \nFacilities of complex schools will be used to conduct in-service training programs. In addition, the \nProject will finance (i) a national engineering consulting firm to support in preparing tender \ndocuments for rehabilitation and repair works, and supervise all civil works; (ii) national private \ntraining providers to conduct management training; and (iii) a national IT consulting firm to \nsupport the establishment of computerized management information systems, including adequate \ntraining of staff to operate these systems. \n \n7.  Disbursement Arrangements \n \n68.  The proposed grant will be disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s  Loan Disbursement \nHandbook (2001). An imprest account will be established to expedite disbursement of the project \nfunds.  The  PIU  will  open  the  account  in  a  commercial  bank  selected  by  the  Government, \nacceptable to ADB. The ceiling of the imprest account will not exceed estimated ADB-financed \nexpenditures for 6 months, or 10% of the grant amount, whichever is lower. The initial amount to \nbe deposited in the imprest account will not exceed $500,000. \n \n69.  Statement  of  expenditure  procedures  will  be  used  to  reimburse  eligible  expenditures \nunder  ADB-financed  activities  and  liquidate  advances  provided  to  the  imprest  account,  in \naccordance with procedures satisfactory to ADB and consistent with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement \nHandbook.  Each  individual  payment  reimbursed  or  liquidated  under  the  procedures  will  not \nexceed $100,000 equivalent for each item of expenditure. \n \n8.  Advance Contracting and Retroactive Financing \n \n70.  The Government has requested advance contracting and retroactive financing for (i) the \nrecruitment of PIU staff, including a project manager, financial specialist, M&E specialist, and \noffice  assistant;  (ii)  the  recruitment  of  two  consultants  to  support  the  preparation  of  the \nconsolidation strategy; and (iii) the procurement of PIU office equipment and a vehicle. The \nadvance contracting will be undertaken in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines and \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants. Retroactive financing will apply to such expenses incurred \nafter  1  December  2006  until  the  date  the  grant  becomes  effective  and  for  an  amount  not \nexceeding  $100,000.  The  Government  was  advised  that  ADB  Management\u2019s  approval  of \nadvanced contracting will not commit ADB to subsequently approve the project or to finance the \nprocurement costs, and retroactive financing approved by Management \u201cin principle\u201d is subject to \napproval by the Board, and as such does not commit ADB to financing the Project. \n \n9.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n \n71.  The EA will maintain the project accounts and prepare financial statements according to \ninternational accounting standards. The EA will have the project accounts and related financial \nstatements audited annually by independent auditors acceptable to ADB. Certified copies of the \naudited project accounts and audited financial statements (including the auditor\u2019s opinion on the \nuse of grant proceeds, compliance with covenants, and the use of the imprest account under ", "17 \nADB\u2019s statement of expenditure procedures) will be submitted to ADB in English not later than \n6 months after the end of each financial year. \n \n72.  The PIU will prepare quarterly reports on project implementation to be approved by the \nPSC and submit them to ADB within 30 days after each quarter. Reports will be in a form \nacceptable to ADB and will indicate, among other matters, progress made against established \ntargets, problems and constraints encountered during the last quarter, steps taken and proposed \nto be taken to resolve problems, compliance with covenants, and the proposed program of \nactivities for the succeeding quarter. Within 3 months after completion of the Project, the PIU will \nsubmit  a  project  completion  report  to  ADB  providing  details  about  project  implementation, \naccomplishments, costs, impacts, and other information requested by ADB. \n \n10.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n \n73.  Within the first month of implementation, the PIU will prepare a project performance \nmanagement system in accordance with ADB\u2019s project performance management system. In \naddition to the performance targets and indicators specified in the project design and monitoring \nframework (Appendix 1), the Project will develop a monitoring mechanism to (i) evaluate project \nimpacts on the participation of disabled students and students from poor families, (ii) assess \nwhether new equipment is fully integrated in curriculum and lesson plans and utilized by students \nfor practical training, and (iii) review whether managers and instructors trained under the Project \napply  their  new  knowledge  and  skills.  Monitoring  results  will  be  used  to  adjust  the  annual \nimplementation plans.17 A regular tracer system will be established to monitor whether graduates \nfrom PVS have found employment or started their own income-earning activities. Feedback from \nemployers  and  parents  will  be  collected  to  monitor  and  adjust  training  programs  and \nimplementation schedules regularly, if necessary. Rehabilitation works will be monitored by the \nEA and reports will be submitted to the PSC and ADB on an annual basis. \n \n11.  Project Review \n \n74.  ADB and the Government will jointly undertake semiannual reviews of the Project. The \nreviews will assess progress in each component, identify issues and constraints, and determine \nnecessary remedial action and adjustments. A midterm review will be conducted at the end of the \nsecond  year  of  implementation.  The  midterm  review  will  (i)  review  the  scope,  design,  and \nimplementation arrangements; and identify adjustments required; (ii) assess progress of the \nproject  implementation  against  performance  indicators;  and  (iii)  recommend  changes  in  the \ndesign or implementation arrangements, if necessary. \n \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n \n75.  Project Benefits and Impacts. The Government has launched a number of reforms to \nimprove the business climate and create a supportive enabling framework for the private sector. \nTransforming the current PVE system\u2014from one that is supply-driven and inefficient to one \nattuned to labor market needs capable of producing better equipped and skilled workers, and \nproviding  training  and  retraining  opportunities  for  out-of-school  youth  and  adults\u2014will \ncomplement the Government\u2019s strategic thrust to promote private sector growth. \n \n76.  The  close  link  between  educational  development  and  reduction  in  the  incidence  of \npoverty, improvement of productivity, economic growth, and improving general living conditions is \n                                                 \n17 During the appraisal mission, a draft plan of operation to prepare for consolidation of the PVE system was approved \nfor the first year of implementation (Supplementary Appendix B). For each year of project implementation, the PIU \nwill prepare a detailed implementation plan to be approved by the PSC and submitted to ADB. \n ", "18 \nwell established. About 24,000 students will benefit from the reform of the PVE system. New \ndemand-driven curriculum modules, rehabilitated and upgraded training workshops, and practice-\noriented training programs, will improve their employment and income-earning opportunities after \ngraduation. In addition, at the end of the project duration, it is assumed that at least 6,000 adults \nand  out-of-school  youth  will  benefit  annually  from  relevant  short-term  skills  training  courses \nconducted by PVE schools. Considering that more than 50% of youth and adults participating in \ntraining programs belong to low-income families, the Project will contribute to enhancing income \nopportunities of the poor. About 1,300 instructors, 500 teachers, and 200 school managers and \nadministrators  will  benefit  from  in-service  training  programs.  Companies  will  benefit  from \nimprovements in the relevance and quality of training programs that will result in better prepared \nskilled workers and contribute to higher productivity. \n \n77.  To improve gender responsiveness, the Project will develop strategies to address gender \nstereotypes  in  curriculum  and  material  development.  The  Project  was  designed  through  a \nparticipatory process involving key government stakeholders, business associations, companies, \nand civil society groups. During implementation, the Project will maintain broad stakeholder \nparticipation in its activities. \n \n78.  Sustainability. The Government\u2019s contribution to the Project is included in the budget and \nestimated at $3.0 million, which will be from 0.4% to 0.5% of the total expenditure on education. It \ncan be assumed that the project activities are sustainable, taking into account (i) anticipated \nincreased proceeds through income generation activities from schools, which are expected to \ndouble within the Project\u2019s duration; and (ii) cost-effective improvements of the PVE system \nthrough consolidation and rationalization. The Government is strongly committed to reform the \nPVE  system.  The  Mid  Term  Budget  Framework  2006\u20132008  indicates  that  PVE  funding  will \nincrease during 2006\u20132008. The major share of increases in PVE funding is committed to raise \nteachers\u2019 salaries and increase daily allowances for school food, which will improve the working \nand learning environment in PVSs.  \n \n79.  An examination was made to assess whether there will be sufficient funds available to \ncover expenditures of a consolidated system including costs for utilities, O&M and purchase of \nconsumables  to  operate  training  workshops.  Details  are  provided  in  Appendix  4.  It  can  be \nassumed that from 2010 onwards\u2014when the consolidation and rationalization measures and the \nintroduction of an entrepreneurial culture at school level will show impacts\u2014sufficient funds will \nbe available to cover training measures and operate and maintain training workshops and other \nfacilities. However, the examination indicates that funds required for further capital investments to \nrehabilitate and equip all schools within the system will not be sufficient. The Government will \ndepend on external assistance to meet future challenges in rehabilitating and upgrading all \nschools in the PVE system. \n \n80.  Environmental and Social Safeguards. The Project will carry out minor rehabilitation \nand repairs of existing school buildings and facilities; there will be no land acquisition required, \nand no negative environmental or resettlement impact. Some school rehabilitation works will \ninclude improved water supply and sanitation and sewage systems, which will promote good \nhealth and have a positive environmental impact. There are no issues of ethnic minority language \nof instruction, so ADB\u2019s Policy on Indigenous Peoples (1998) is not applicable. \n \n81.  Assumptions. Successful implementation of the Project assumes that the Government \nwill (i) increase the budget allocation for PVE as indicated, (ii) be committed to consolidate and \nmodernize the PVE system, and (iii) provide adequate budget to finance in-service training as \nplanned. To achieve its impact, the Project assumes that further steady economic growth will \ncreate new job opportunities. ", "19 \n \n82.  Risks. At present, MLSP\u2019s managerial and technical capacity is limited, and might affect \nthe smooth implementation of reforming the PVE system. This risk will be mitigated through \ntraining  and  capacity  building  under  the  Project.  The  impact  of  consolidating  schools  and \nintroducing a new entrepreneurship approach will be significant. Risks include resistance from \nteachers and school directors to accept changes. The risks will be mitigated by adopting a \nparticipatory  and  transparent  approach  to  project  implementation\u2014actively  involving  school \ndirectors, instructors, teachers, and employers.  \n \n83.  Financial risks involve potential difficulties in the provision of recurrent costs for O&M and \nfunds  for  consumables.  During  project  implementation,  the  Project  will  mitigate  the  risk  by \nproviding a lump sum to rehabilitated workshops to support the first year of operation. In addition, \nthe Project\u2019s strategy aims at reducing the dependency on public allocations by promoting an \nentrepreneurial approach and strengthening income generation at PVS level.  \n \nV.  ASSURANCES \n \n84.  In addition to the standard assurances stipulated in the Grant Agreement, the Government \nhas given the following assurances, which will be incorporated in the legal documents. \n \n85.  Counterpart Funding. Throughout project implementation, the Government will allocate \nand release in a timely manner adequate budget funding for (i) the costs in support of training \nprograms; and (ii) incremental recurrent costs of O&M of all selected schools under the Project.  \n \n86.  The Government will also allocate and release in a timely manner adequate budget and \nprovide sufficient and qualified staff to the Research and Methodology Department so that it will \nbe  able  to  regularly  review  and  update  curriculum  and  ensure  that  training  programs  are \nrefocused  on  the  needs  of  the  formal  and  informal  labor  market.  Throughout  project \nimplementation, the Government will provide ADB with information on allocations and actual \nexpenditures for PVE system through submission of annual reports, in a form acceptable to ADB.   \n \n87.  Consolidation Strategy. The Government will approve a consolidation strategy for the \nPVE system, satisfactory to ADB not later than 6 months after grant effectiveness and will \nimplement  measures  identified  in  the  strategy  within  3  years  after  grant  effectiveness.  The \nGovernment will ensure that the amount of annual budget allocation for PVE system throughout \nproject implementation will be increased to cover the O&M costs.  \n \n88.  The Government will ensure that, by no later than 12 months after the grant effectiveness, \nthe legal environment is established to enable (i) the EA to manage, sell, and rent out current \nassets and reallocate staff of schools; and (ii) PVS to keep revenues earned through training \ncourses and marketing of services and goods. \n \n89.  Schools Selection Process. The Government will ensure that only schools selected \nthrough a competitive process will be eligible for rehabilitation and provision of equipment under \nthe Project. Selection will be based on the assessment of business plans prepared by schools \nproviding information on (i) planned training courses for skills in demand and number of potential \nparticipants, (ii) availability of qualified teachers and instructors, (iii) partnership arrangements \nwith local industries, (iv) plans for utilization of new equipment, and (v) availability of adequate \nfunding  for  consumables  and  O&M  costs.  The  EA  will  establish,  within  2  months  of  grant \neffectiveness, a selection committee that will review proposals and select schools. The committee \nwill  consist  of  five  members,  including  one  representative  each  from  DVTE,  from  MLSP, \nemployers, civil society, and development partners. The key criterion for the selection of schools \n ", "20 \nwill be the impact of the training courses on employability and income earning opportunities of \nparticipants. \n  \n90.  The Government will ensure that all rehabilitation works under the Project are undertaken \nwithin the existing school facilities, which will not require any land acquisition. All project facilities \nwill be operated and maintained in accordance with government environmental and safety rules \nand regulations. \n \n91.  Project Performance Management System. The Government will ensure that, within \n3 months of the grant effectiveness, the PIU establishes the project performance management \nsystem to monitor progress of project implementation and evaluate project impacts based on the \nkey baseline indicators agreed between the EA and ADB. \n \n92.  Transparency  and  Anticorruption.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  (i)  relevant \nprovisions  of  ADB\u2019s  policy  on  Anticorruption  are  included  in  all  bidding  documents;  (ii)  all \ncontracts financed by ADB in connection with the Project include provisions specifying the right of \nADB to audit and examine the records and accounts of the EA and all contractors, suppliers, \nconsultants,  and  other  service  providers  as  they  relate  to  the  Project;  and  (iii)  an  audit  of \nprocurement activities is carried out at least twice during the project implementation. The cost of \nthe audit will be financed by the Project provided that the auditor is selected though a competitive \nprocess and has qualifications and terms of reference acceptable to ADB.  \n \n93.  The Government will establish, within 6 months from grant effectiveness, a website that \nwill present information on the project progress, including information on, among other things, \nschools selected under the Project, current training programs of the PVE system, procurement \nactivities, including the list of participating bidders, names of the winning bidders, basic details on \nthe adopted bidding procedures, amounts of the contracts awarded, the list of goods and/or \nservices purchased, and their intended and actual utilization. \n \n94.  Conditions for Contract Awards. Prior to award of any contract for civil works and \nprovision of equipment, the Government will present to ADB documents confirming that (i) a \nconsolidation strategy for the PVE system has been approved, (ii) all schools selected under the \nconsolidation  process  are  duly  registered  by  the  respective  registration  authority,  and  (iii) \nsufficient budgetary resources for O&M costs of those schools for the next year are allocated. \n \n95.  Effectiveness Conditions. Prior to grant effectiveness, the Government will establish \nand make operational the PIU within DVTE in a manner satisfactory to ADB, including the \nappointment of the project director, acceptable to ADB. \n \nVI.

The Ministry of Education (MOE) is the central government agency that formulates \nnational education policy and set the standards for each level of formal education. MOE also \nadministers curriculum development and teacher training for general education, directs state \nexamination procedures, and is responsible for the accreditation of higher education institutions. \nThe  current  structure  of  the  education  system  is  described  in  Table  A2.1.  The  Law  on \nEducation, the Education Development Concept until 2010, and the National Action Plan on \nEducation  for  All  (EFA)  define  the  framework  for  the  Government\u2019s  education  policy.  The \nNational Action Plan on EFA aims at universal enrollment in general education and highlights \nthe importance of primary vocational education and the development of an adult education \nsystem. \n \nTable A2.1:  Structure of the Education System \n \nEducation Stage  Grade  Age  Institutions \n \n       \nPostgraduate Education            >23   \n       \nHigher Education  17\u201324  49 universities and other higher \n    education institutions \n   \nSecondary Vocational Education       17\u201318  22 secondary vocational \n  education institutions \n \nGeneral  Primary Vocational  10\u201311  16\u201318  116 gymnasiums/lyceums \nSecondary  Education   112 primary vocational education  \nEducation  institutions \n \nGeneral Education   1\u2013 9  7\u201315  2,045 general education schools \n \n \nPreschool    3\u20136  416 kindergartens/preschools \n \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n2.  General Education. The education system in the Kyrgyz Republic still follows the Soviet \nmodel and includes (i) pre-schooling, (ii) 11 years of general education (primary: grades 1\u20134; \nlower secondary: grades 5\u20139; and upper secondary education: grades 10\u201311), (iii) primary \nvocational  education  (PVE),  (iv)  secondary  vocational  education  (SVE)  and  (iv)  higher \neducation. Primary and lower secondary education is compulsory. The Government is currently \nconsidering extending general education by 1 year to 12 years. The Constitution stipulates free \nbasic education (grades 1\u20139) for all children. In 2003, net enrollment rate was 98.6% in primary \ngrades and 72.28% in upper secondary grades. Enrollment in primary education was 96.8% \n(97.8% of boys, 95.8% of girls); 92.8% in lower secondary education (92.6% of boys, 93.0% of \ngirls); and 72% in upper secondary education (68% of boys, 76.1% of girls). In the 2005/2006 \nschool year, about 1.12 million students were enrolled in 2,066 general education schools, of \nwhich 351 were urban and 1,694 were rural.

Secondary Vocational Education. The Kyrgyz Republic has two separate systems of \nvocational  education\u2014primary  vocational  education  (PVE),  described  in  Appendix  3,  and \nsecondary vocational education (SVE). SVE is provided by various ministries and agencies, \nincluding private training providers, which offer programs at the post-school level but below the \nlevel of higher education. SVE institutions do not represent a \u201csystem\u201d in the same way as the \nother education subsectors. In total, 70 institutions18 offer SVE programs and about 27,000 \nstudents were enrolled in 2005. No tracer studies are available but anecdotal evidence suggests \nthat  a  large  number  of  SVE  graduates  have  difficulties  finding  employment  after  course \ncompletion.  Linkages  are  weak  among  SVE  institutions  and  with  PVE  and  industry.  A \ncomprehensive vocational education and skills development (VESD) policy\u2014linked to a national \nhuman resources development plan, and present and future labor market needs\u2014is not in \nplace. Table A2.3 provides data on the nature of SVE programs and details SVE enrollment by \narea of study and gender. \n \n                                                 \n18 Sponsors of SVE institutions include the Ministry of Education, Science and Youth Policy (22 SVE institutions), \nMinistry of Health Care (10), State Commission on Culture (9), Ministry of Labor and Social Protection (MLSP) (3), \nKyrgyz Union of Consumers (2), Ministry of Economy and Finance (1), State Commission on Physical Training and \nSports  (1),  Ministry  of  Internal  Affairs  (1),  Ministry  of  Transport  and  Communications  (1),  Association  of \nCooperatives (1), SVE institutes attached to higher educations institutions (11), and private institutions (8). \n ", "26  Appendix 2 \nTable A2.3: Enrollment in SVE by Area of Study and Gender, 2003\u20132004 \n  Enrollments \nArea of study  Total  % of total  Females  % of total \nNatural science  190  0.7  169  83.7 \nHumanities and social studies   787  2.9  204  26.0 \nEducation (General education  2,389  8.8  2,113  88.0 \nteachers) \nPublic health  8,200  30.2  7,387  90.2 \nCulture and art  1,357  5.0  856  63.0 \nEconomics and administration  5,865  21.6  3,885  66.3 \nGeology and mineral exploration  81  0.3  15  18.5 \nMining  27  0.1  0  0.0 \nEnergy  706  2.6  168  24.1 \nHeavy industry and metal filing  217  0.8  26  12.3 \nTechnological machines and  1,222  4.5  39  3.2 \nequipment \nElectrical engineering  81  0.3  0  0.0 \nInstrument making  27  0.1  23  92.0 \nElectronic equipment:  625  2.3  273  44.4 \nSemi-conducting devices \nIT services  271  1.0  74  26.06 \nOther Services  543  2.0  411  74.6 \nTransport  543  2.0  90  16.5 \nChemical technology  27  0.1  0  0.0 \nTimber processing   81  0.3  6  8.6 \nFood technology  597  2.2  391  65.9 \nMass production technology  869  3.2  865  99.0 \nConstruction and architecture  706  2.6  109  15.7 \nGeodesy and mapping  109  0.4  29  30.2 \nAgriculture and fishery  1,303  4.8  274  20.9 \nEnvironment   380  1.4  82  22.3 \nTotal  27,154  100.0  17,489  64.4 \nIT = information technology, SVE = secondary vocational education. \nSource: Ministry of Education. \n \n4.  Higher Education. Higher education is offered by 49 institutions, and the number of \nstudents has increased over the past 5 years. However, academic quality has deteriorated \nsignificantly because of lack of connection between higher education institutions and industry; \nand  the  cumulative  effects  of  corruption,  low  faculty  salaries,  an  insufficient  supply  of \nappropriately qualified faculty, shortages of learning materials and technology resources, and \ninadequate  facilities.  The  proliferation  of  new  and  weak  higher  education  institutions  has \nexacerbated this problem. Increasing enrollment in higher education demonstrates that many \nyoung people and their parents perceive a university education to be a worthwhile investment. \nHowever, the rising level of enrollment in higher education has important implications in terms of ", "Appendix 2  27 \nthe size of the population and economic structure of the Kyrgyz Republic. The capacity of the \neconomy cannot absorb the increasing number of graduates in jobs that match their academic \nbackgrounds. Table A2.4 provides information on enrollment and number of higher education \ninstitutions. Out of about 231,000 students enrolled in 2005, about 105,000 were enrolled in \ndistance learning programs. \n \nTable A2.4: Enrollments and Number of Higher Education Institutions \nNumber  2000  2001  2002  2003  2004  2005 \nInstitutions   45  48  46  47  49  49a \nStudents (\u2019000)   188.8  207.4  199.1  203.0  218.3  231.1 \na 34 are public institutions; 17 are private. \nSource: National Statistic Committee (NSC). \n \n5.  Private Training Providers. The Ministry of Education has a system which registers \ninstitutions, firms, and individual businesses that provide education and training. However, the \nministry concedes that its registration process does not cover all such institutions and that some \nwould operate outside the registration system. Most of the private providers are located in urban \nareas and offer programs in areas such as driver training, language tuition, short management \ncourses, art and craft, and computer training. Some private training providers are also involved \nin \u201ccivics\u201d education and other programs that assist people to adjust to the new economic \nrealities of the Kyrgyz Republic and participate in democratic processes. However, the overall \nquality of the programs was rated poor.  \n ", "28  Appendix 3 \nPRIMARY VOCATIONAL EDUCATION \n \n1.  The primary vocational education (PVE) system was developed under the Soviet era to \nbecome a principal training network for skilled workers. It was well linked with industry needs \nand  many  of  the  primary  vocational  schools  (PVSs)  were  located  next  to  large  factories, \nspecialized in providing qualified workers for particular trades. At its height, the PVE system \nprovided training for up to 90,000 students. However, since 1991, PVE has become one of the \nmost neglected areas of education in the Kyrgyz Republic. The Government reduced its support \nfunds for operation and maintenance (O&M) and reinvestment in training equipment decreased \nsignificantly, buildings deteriorated, and enrollment fell substantially. \n \n2.  At present, the PVE system is administered by the Department for Vocational Training \nand Education (DVTE) under the Ministry of Labor and Social Protection (MLSP) and consists of \n112  PVSs.  In  2005,  24,148  students  were  enrolled  in  PVSs;  36%  were  female  students. \nAccording  to  DVTE  data,  about  10,000  students  are  from  low-income  families.  Anecdotal \nevidence and surveys in rural areas suggest that the number of poor students is much higher, \nand that up to 70% of PVE students belong to poor families. Currently, PVSs offer three types of \ncourses:  (i)  three-year  programs  combine  a  vocational  specialty  with  general  education, \nproviding students with the necessary certificate to study further in a higher education institution \n(56% of PVE students are enrolled in the 3-year program); (ii) two-year programs are designed \nfor students from grade 9 and provide vocational education with some general education, but \nthis program does not provide the general education components required for higher education; \nand (iii) 10-month courses that strictly target vocational skills, and are marketed to both youth \nand adults. In addition, some PVSs offer limited short-term skills courses for adults, mainly \nsponsored by the Employment Services. However, in 2005, only about 500 adults were enrolled \nin short courses. \n \n3.  Nature of PVE courses.

PVS Staff. The staff composition of the PVE system is inefficient. Senior staff is too \nthinly spread and the ratio of nonteaching staff to administrative and management staff is \nunbalanced. Out of about 7,400 staff engaged in PVSs, only about 20% are skills instructors \nand 13% are general education teachers; the remaining 67% are managers, administrators, and \nsupport staff (including 332 directors and deputy directors). Only 89 senior skills instructors are \nengaged in 112 PVSs. Staff salaries are extremely low\u2014the scheduled salary for instructors \nand teachers is Som1,400 ($35) per month, which is well below a living wage. The scheduled \nsalary for a school director is less than Som2,000 ($50) per month, which is very low compared \nwith  a  skilled  trades  wage  of  around  Som6,000  per  month.  Salary  increases  are  vital  for \nimproving the motivation of instructors and teachers and attracting new qualified faculties. The \nGovernment has acknowledged the need to address the low salary level and has indicated that \nit will raise salaries each year over the next 3 years. \n \n6.  Discussions with PVS directors revealed that a wide variety of techniques are used to \nrecruit staff. For example, retired trade workers supplement their incomes by passing on their \nskills, albeit with little or no pedagogical training. However, they are reported to perform better \nthan pedagogically trained instructors who have no real skills experience. In view of this, the \nProject will provide in-service training for instructors to improve teaching techniques.  \n ", "30  Appendix 3 \nTable A3.3: Primary Vocational School Staffing, 2006 \nPosition Name  Staff Positions  Positions Filled \nA.

The average size of PVSs, in terms of enrollment, is very small. The PVE system was \noriginally  designed  for  90,000  students  but  many  classrooms,  training  workshops,  and \ndormitories are largely underutilized because of a sharp decrease in enrollment. Lack of an \nassets management strategy and restrictive legal and administrative regulations mean that \nDVTE is not in a position to manage its complex range of assets efficiently. A revision of the \ncurrent  legislative  and  administrative  framework  conditions  is  needed  to  enable  DVTE  to \nimprove  the  management  of  its  resources,  including  merging  schools,  selling  obsolete \nequipment,  and  closing  down  and  renting  out  underutilized  buildings.  Schools  with  small \nenrollment  have  considerably  higher  training  unit  costs  than  schools  with  higher  student \nenrollment.  \n \n9.  Poor Quality and Relevance. The quality and relevance of PVE programs suffers from \nweak interaction with industry and communities, and lack of systematic labor market research. \nAlthough some PVSs have developed good linkages with local companies and provide relevant \nskills training, the majority of training programs are largely supply-driven and are often based on \nallocated budgets and available staff and equipment rather than market demand. Failure to \nshare information and resources between companies and PVSs creates a gap between supply \nand  demand  of  skilled  labors,  and  lowers  the  quality  and  relevance  of  training  programs. \nInstructors, teachers, and school managers are often unable to fully explore ways to involve \nlocal employers and communities in skills identification, design of training programs, provision of \non-the-job training, and apprentice schemes.  \n \n10.  Qualification of Instructors and Teachers. The teaching techniques and technical \nskills and knowledge of most instructors and teachers are outdated and need to be upgraded. \nMany teachers focus on delivering content, as specified in their curriculum, and not on achieving \nthe performance expected for employment. Under the Soviet system, teachers received periodic \nin-service training. However, the current in-service training has become infrequent because of \nlimited  resources.  Instructors  have  no  benchmarks  to  measure  their  own  technical  and \ninstructional capability, so they have no means of determining the gap between their current \nperformance and their desired capability. Performance specifications and skills standards are \nneeded  as  benchmarks  for  delivery  and  assessment.  A  systematic  monitoring  system\u2014to \nensure the quality of training programs\u2014is not in place. \n ", "32  Appendix 3 \n11.  Curriculum Development. The PVE curriculum is developed by the Research and \nMethodology  Department  under  DVTE.  Industry  involvement  in  curriculum  development  is \nlimited and current curriculum modules are not revised regularly to reflect changing technology \nand market demands. The curriculum needs to be adjusted to incorporate student-centered \nmodern  teaching  methods  and  emphasis  on  a  stronger  practical  training  approach.  Many \ngraduates will find jobs or start self-employment in the informal sector, so entrepreneurship will \nbe one of the most important skills for many young people and entrepreneurship skills need to \nbe incorporated in the curriculum. To increase job opportunities, particularly in the informal \nsector, a modernized curriculum should support PVSs to produce multiskilled graduates.  \n \n12.  Learning Material. Textbooks and learning and teaching materials in use are obsolete. \nMore than 90% of 1,100 textbook titles were developed before 1980, and less than 5% of \ncurrent  textbooks  have  been  revised  since  1990.  A  new  approach  in  training  material \ndevelopment\u2014promoting  independent  learning  and  practical  workshop  experience  with  the \ninvolvement of teachers and instructors from PVSs and experts from the private sector\u2014is \nrequired to produce modern learning materials for students.  \n \n13.  Weak  Assessment.  Currently,  no  comprehensive  system  for  skills  standards  and \nassessment is in place. The quality of skills training depends on the quality of instruction, which \nis often adversely affected by lack of training materials and equipment, and poor teaching \nenvironment and outdated knowledge of teachers. PVSs set their own examinations, without \nformal external quality control or moderation. Industry is only involved occasionally in preparing \nand participating in examinations.  \n \n14.  Low Status. The status of PVE is low, and information among grade 8\u201311 students and \ntheir parents about job and income-earning opportunities for skilled workers in the informal and \nformal sector is poor. At present, the Youth Labor Exchange is the only organization that \nprovides  job  orientation  programs  in  secondary  schools  and  placement  support  for  youth. \nHowever, the capacity of the Youth Labor Exchange is very weak, so only a limited number \nbenefit from its services.  \n \n15.  Training  Provision  for  Adults.  The  current  system  performs  poorly  in  terms  of \nproviding  market-oriented  skills  training  for  adults  and  out-of-school  youth.  Most  adults, \nparticularly the poor in rural areas, lack access to skills training that could enhance their earning \ncapacity. Relevant short-term training programs are offered in a limited manner by DVTE, other \nline  ministries,  and  a  few  private  providers\u2014mainly  in  urban  areas.  Currently,  no  skills \ndevelopment strategy is in place to address adult training and retraining needs.   \n \n16.  Poor Facilities. Very poor infrastructure and lack of adequate training equipment in \nmost PVSs mean that students only \u201clearn\u201d about skills in theory but are not able to put them \ninto  practice.  This  lack  of  practical  training  reduces  their  employment  opportunities  after \ngraduation. The  PVE  system  consists  of  112 schools  with  1,603 classrooms,  437  training \nworkshops, 56 computer classrooms, and 72 dormitories. A survey revealed that 41% of the \ntraining workshops are in poor condition, 19% in very poor condition, and only 40% in good \ncondition. Fifty-seven percent of the classrooms are considered to be in good condition. The \nbuilding construction and technology of PVSs that have not yet benefited from rehabilitation \nmeasures, are based on 30-year old construction standards which are inefficient in terms of use \nof materials, structural capacity, and energy performance. PVS facilities continue to deteriorate \nbecause of inadequate maintenance and investment. Roofs, doors, floors, walls, windows, \nelectrical lighting, and heating and ventilation systems are in poor condition and in need of \nurgent repairs or rehabilitation.

The primary vocational education (PVE) sector is mainly financed from two sources: \n(i) public budget (including the national and oblast budgets),19 and (ii) income generation by \nprimary vocational schools (PVSs). Public expenditure on education (PEE) has remained at \nabout 4% of gross domestic product (GDP) over recent years and is expected to rise from \n4.02% in 2004 to 4.93% in 2008. This is comparable with other transition economies, e.g., the \neducation sector\u2019s share of GDP in Kazakhstan was 3.9% in 2004. However, PVE funding of \nPVE is very low. Teacher and instructor salaries have not been inflation adjusted since 1997, \nand need to be enhanced to improve motivation and attract new qualified staff. The Government \nhas acknowledged the need for salary increases and has raised PVE budget provisions for \n2006,  2007,  and  2008.

Although PVSs lack adequate equipment and operate under \nvery poor infrastructure conditions, the 112 PVSs generated revenues of Som39.8 million in \n2005, or 12.6% of total PVE expenditures. The main sources of income are tuition fees (42%), \nproduction activities (15%), agriculture activities, and other service provision (32%). It can be \nassumed that PVS income generation will be doubled within 3 years once training workshops \nare  rehabilitated,  new  equipment  is  in  place,  and  the  Project  has  provided  training  on \nentrepreneurial approaches. This is a conservative estimate, as some of the schools are now at \na very low base of income generation because they do not have much to offer, and very limited \ncapacity to make products or provide services.  \n \nTable A4.2: Expenditure Categories in 2005 \n(Som\u2019000) \nSubtotal  Income-\nNational  Oblasta \nItem  Public  Generation  Total  % \nBudget  Budget \nBudget  Fund \nIncome Generation   216,908  60,241  277,149  39,888  317,038  100 \nA.

Unit Costs. The average size of PVS enrollment is relatively small. In 2005, 24,148 \nstudents were enrolled in 112 PVSs\u2014an average of 215 students per school. Schools with \nsmall enrollment have considerably higher training unit costs than schools with larger student \nenrollment. Training unit costs in PVSs with less than 100 students are Som14.9 while training \nunit costs in schools with more than 350 students are only Som5.8. At present, only 15 schools \nout of 112 PVSs have more than 350 students enrolled. The main reason for this is the high \nratio of nonteaching staff in small schools. A consolidated system will improve utilization of \nfacilities  and  ensure  more  efficient  staff  deployment.  Restructured  and  merged  PVSs  with \nefficient staff structures will be more flexible to respond to changing labor market demands. \nTable A4.3 compares the unit costs of schools by enrollment size.

Sustainability of the Project. The combined effects of (i) restructuring and rationalizing \nthe current PVE system, which will result in more efficient utilization infrastructure and staff \nresources; and (ii) applying an entrepreneurial management approach that will increase revenue \ngeneration at school level, will ensure cost-effective improvements of the PVE system.  \n \n6.  The Government\u2019s contribution to the Project is estimated at $3.0 million over 4 years \nand mainly includes (i) taxes and duties on civil works, equipment, and materials purchased \nunder the Project; (ii) staff contributions; and (iii) provision of office facilities and workshops. To \ndate, provisional financial projections have only been made until 2008. Although there is no \nfinancial information beyond 2008, it can be assumed that the Government is committed to \nreform the PVE system; it has indicated that it will increase PVE allocation after 2008 to offset \ninflation increases and ensure sufficient budget for O&M for rehabilitated schools. During project \nimplementation, project costs for the Government will be from 0.4% to 0.5% of total expenditure \non education; such project costs are insignificant. It can be assumed that project activities are \nsustainable, taking into account (i) anticipated increased proceeds from PVS income generation \nactivities, (ii) cost-effective improvements of the PVE system through consolidation, and (iii) the \nstrong commitment of the Government to support restructuring of the PVE system.  \n \nTable A4.4: GDP, Public Expenditure on Education,  \nand Government Share in the Project \n(Som \u2018000) \n \nItem  2003  2004  2005  2006  2007  2008 \nGDP (Som billion)  83.4  94.1  102.8  113.4  124.7  137.3 \n \nPEE (Som million)  3,555  3,784.2  4,232.3  5,521.2  6,055.0  6,765.2 \n \nPublic Expenditure on PVE    234.2  277.2  339.5  369.8  406.0 \n(Som million) \n \nPVE Income Generation      39.8  45  50  70 \n(Som million) \n  \nGovernment Share in the          30  30 \nProject (Som million) \n \nGovernment Share in the          0.49  0.44 \nProject (% of PEE) \nGDP = gross domestic product, PEE = public expenditure on education, PVE = primary vocational education. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n7.  Income Generation. Most PVSs currently operate in a difficult environment, with poor \nworkshop facilities and lack of adequate training equipment. They have very limited means to \ngenerate income, but the PVS system managed to generate revenue of about Som40 million in \n2005. It is assumed that schools will increase their revenues (Table A4.5) after (i) the PVE \nsystem is consolidated, (ii) training workshops of selected PVSs are rehabilitated and newly \nequipped, and (iii) school management applies an entrepreneurial management approach.  \n \n8.  To project future income generation, the following potential scenario is assumed. Based \non income generation in 2005, it is assumed that revenue generation through tuition fees will \nincrease by 10% per year. For 2006 and 2007, it is estimated that income generation through \nproduction, and agriculture activities and service provision, will rise by 8%. In 2008 and 2009, \nafter training workshops are rehabilitated and equipped, and school management operates in an \nentrepreneurial manner, it is assumed that income generation will increase further\u2014production \nand agriculture activities, and service provision will increase by 15%. In 2010, a 20% increase is \nassumed in all three income areas after more schools benefit under the Project through new \nequipment and entrepreneurial training. \n ", "38  Appendix 4 \n9.  The Project will introduce a system of short-term skill courses for out-of-school youth \nand  adults.  After  upgrading  workshop  facilities  and  developing  new  demand-driven  short \ncourses, it is assumed that PVS will start providing training courses for adults and out-of-school \nyouth from 2008 onward. In 2008, it is assumed that 2,000 participants will enroll in short-term \ncourses; in 2009, 4,000 youth and adults will enroll in courses; and in 2010, 5,000 participants \nwill benefit from short-term skills training. Course fees will be paid partly by the participants and \nsponsored by the Government through the Employment Funds under the National Office of \nMigration and Ministry of Labor and Social Protection (MLSP). It is assumed that the course fee \nper participant will be about Som3,600 on average.  \n \n10.  From 2008 onward, through consolidation efforts, it is assumed that the PVE system will \ngenerate  income  by  selling  obsolete  equipment  and  renting  out  underutilized  buildings \n(Table A4.5). \n \nTable A4.5: Projections for Primary Vocational School Income Generation  \n(Som million) \nItem  2005  2006      2007  2008  2009  2010 \nTuition Fee  16.8       (42%) 18.5  20.2  22.4  24.6  27.1 \nProduction Activities   6.0       (15%) 6.5  7.0  8.1  9.3  11.2 \nAgriculture Activities  4.4       (11%) 4.8  5.2  6.0  6.9  8.3 \nService Provision   12.8       (32%) 13.8  14.9  17.1  19.7  23.6 \nShort Skills Courses        7.2  14.4  18.0 \nAsset Management        3.0  5.0  6.5 \n        Total  40     (100%) 43.6  47.3  63.8  79.9  94.7 \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n11.  To determine whether there will be sufficient funds available to cover the expenditures of \na consolidated PVE system, an assessment was made based on (i) the expenditure in 2005, \nand (ii) the draft estimated and projected budget for 2006\u20132008 as indicated in the Medium \nTerm Budget Framework of the Ministry of Finance. To provide an outlook for 2010, a 6% \nincrease of the public PVE budget was assumed for 2009 and 2010. This increase is arbitrary \nand is used to illustrate a potential scenario in 2009. The major share of increases in PVE \nfunding  for  2006\u20132008  are  committed  to  raise  teachers\u2019  salaries  and  increase  the  daily \nallowance for food.  \n \nTable A4.6: Projections for Allocation, Income Generation, and Expenditures \n(Som million) \nItem  2005  2006  2007  2008  2009c  2010c \nA.

In \naddition, an increase of 5% is assumed for 2009 and 2010. \n \n13.  Staff Expenditure. It can be assumed that the budget increases for 2006\u20132008 will be \nused to raise teacher salaries by 20% in 2006; 8% in 2007; and 9% in 2008. An increase of \nabout 5% is assumed for 2009 and 2010. In addition to salary increases financed by the public \nbudget, teachers and instructors will benefit from incentives provided through income generation \nat school level; it is assumed that about 10% of income generation will be utilized for staff \nincentives. It is expected that the number of nonteaching staff will be reduced gradually during \nthe consolidation process, which will lead to a reduction in staff expenditure of 10% in 2008 and \n2009 and 5% in 2010. It is assumed that \u201cOther Expenditure\u201d (including allowances and training \nmeasures) will increase by 5% in 2006 and by 10% in subsequent years to cover increased \nexpenditure for training programs conducted under the Project. The combined effects of these \nassumptions are reflected in Table A4.6 under the staff and other costs expenditure category. \n \n14.  The  total  increases  for  staff  expenditures  will  be  sufficient  to  improve  the  working \nconditions  and  motivation  of  PVE  staff,  and  finance  training  measures  planned  under  the \nProject.  \n \n15.  Utility  Expenditure.  Utility  costs  (particularly  heating  and  electricity)  will  decrease \nbecause of (i) rehabilitation measures of existing workshops, classrooms, and dormitories; and \n(ii) consolidation of physical infrastructure. The following scenario is used to demonstrate the \nimpact: (i) an annual inflation-related 5% increase; (ii) a 10% reduction caused by rehabilitation \nand consolidation of PVE infrastructure in 2007; and (iii) a 15% reduction in 2008 and 2009, and \na 10% reduction in 2010.  \n \n16.  Expenditure  on  Repairs,  O&M,  and  Consumables.  The  current  funding  level  for \nbuilding  repair,  O&M,  and  purchase  of  consumables  is  a  serious  issue.  In  2005,  only \nSom17 million was available for these expenditure categories. In 2005, funds for O&M and \nconsumables are about Som11 million, or about an average of Som460 per student. To sustain \ntraining  workshops  and  provide  adequate  consumables  for  practical  hands-on  training,  an \naverage  of  Som4,000  per  student  is  required.  Based  on  the  current  scenario,  about \nSom96 million would be needed for workshop operations\u2014assuming that all workshops are \nrehabilitated, adequately equipped, and in full operation to provide practical training for about \n24,000 students. Further, it is assumed that at least Som10 million per year is required to \nensure building maintenance, including minor repairs. This scenario indicates that, from 2010 \nonward, sufficient funds will be available for O&M and workshop consumables\u2014ensuring quality \nhands-on training. The potential surplus could be used to procure additional consumables to \ncater for a possible increase in student enrollment. \n \n17.  These projections indicate that caution is required with respect to fund allocations for \nO&M and consumables during the first 3 years of project implementation. To mitigate risks \nduring this period, the Project will provide a lump sum to rehabilitated workshops to support the \nfirst year of operation. After project completion, the risk of insufficient public funds for O&M and \nadequate consumables will be addressed by the Project\u2019s strategy to reduce dependency on \npublic  allocations  by  promoting  an  entrepreneurial  approach  and  strengthening  income \ngeneration at PVS level.  \n \n18.  Additional funding needs were examined for rehabilitating and upgrading schools in a \nconsolidated PVE system. Supplementary to the contribution of the Asian Development Bank \n ", "40  Appendix 4 \n(ADB), $26 million would be required to address all capital investment needs. The illustrated \nscenario indicates that potential surpluses are modest in terms of funds required to rehabilitate \nand equip all schools within the system. The Government will depend on external assistance to \nmeet future challenges in rehabilitating and upgrading all schools in the PVE system. \n \n19.  Benefits.  Government  provision  of  PVE  is  justified  because  of  imperfect  market \nconditions  and  lack  of  adequate  private  training  provision  and  financing.20  Youth  training \nprograms offered by private training institutions are limited to a few sectors in urban areas. \nStudents from rural areas are disadvantaged in gaining access to private training, and children \nfrom poor families cannot afford training fees. As private training provision has inadequate \ncapacity,  MLSP  will  need  to  provide  PVE  for  youth  to  (i)  promote  social  equity  through \neducation, and (ii) provide the means to gain employable skills and knowledge for students who \nare not able to advance to higher education. Reform of the current PVE system\u2014to become \nflexible  and  demand-driven\u2014will  enhance  productivity  and  incomes  for  graduates  and \ncompanies, and contribute to economic growth.  \n \n20.  The major beneficiaries of the Project will be about 24,000 students enrolled in PVS. \nRelevant  courses  with  practical  training  and  hands-on  experience,  and  improved  student-\ncentered teaching methods in an entrepreneurial environment, will (i) enhance the technical and \ncognitive proficiency of students, (ii) develop problem solving ability, and (iii) make students \nmore  productive  in  future  employment.  The  desired  impact  of  the  Project  is  improved \nemployability and income-earning opportunities for graduates. However, it is difficult to quantify \nbenefits for PVS graduates in economic terms, as education alone is not sufficient to raise \nincomes. Job opportunities and salary structures depend on various other economic factors. \n \n21.  Without the Project. Most benefits discussed above would be forgone. There would be \nconsiderable uncertainty regarding the Government\u2019s capacity to reform the PVE system into a \nflexible  demand-driven  system.  Increasing  the  supply  of  trained  youth  will  not  create \nemployment by itself. Close linkages with the labor market are the most important economic \nrequirements for a PVE system. The current PVE system was established during the Soviet era \nwhere supply and demand of labor was planned centrally. Without the Project, students will \ncontinue to graduate from a system that is not responsive to industry needs, suffers from \noutdated curriculum and training equipment, and does not provide students with adequate skills \nand knowledge to find jobs after graduation.  \n  \n \n \n                                                 \n20 The purchase of PVE is beyond the means of many poor families in the Kyrgyz Republic. Credit markets do not \nprovide loans to low-income families to finance their children\u2019s education. Poor adults and out-of-school youth from \nlow-income families with low education background are less informed than better educated parents about the \nbenefits or quality of PVE, and may underinvest in PVE.

Linkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \n       \nIs the sector identified as a national    Yes  Is the sector identified as a   Yes \npriority in country poverty analysis?    national priority in country poverty   \n      No  partnership agreement?    No \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in the Kyrgyz Republic: \n \nAccording to the Government\u2019s National reduction strategy a key priority is improvement of the quality and access to \ngeneral education and primary vocational education, to support employment and income-generating activities, \nthereby improving the social safety net and supporting sustainable human development.  In implementing these \nactivities, the Government will ensure that the poor and vulnerable groups of society have equal access to basic \nsocial services, thus supporting their opportunities for employment and participation in economic activities.  \n \nSurveys in rural areas where the majority of the population lives suggest that up to 70% of PVE students belong to \npoor families. Given the evidence in poverty and low level of education, the Project will contribute to increase income \nearning opportunities for poor students by reforming the current PVE system to become relevant and demand driven. \nImproving the teaching and learning environment through school rehabilitation and upgrading of facilities and \nstrengthening the system of professional development for teachers, the Project will contribute towards ensuring that \neducational services are accessible in all areas, particularly in rural areas, and for poor groups. Improving dormitory \naccommodation in PVS will give better opportunities for children from poor remote households to attend vocational \neducation.  \n \nThe  introduction  of  short-term  skills  courses  strengthening  entrepreneurship  skills  and  providing  training  that \npromotes multiskilled workers will particularly help out-of-school youth and unemployed or underemployed adults to \nimprove their income earning opportunities in the informal sector. \n  \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                         Targeting Classification: Targeted Intervention (MDG) \n \nIn 2005, 36% of the total population lived in poverty with an annual income below $225 per year and about 13% of \nthe population are considered to be extremely poor with an income less than $140 per day. Poverty in rural areas \nwas higher than in urban areas. \nThe recent analysis finds that the negative impact of poverty on a child\u2019s dropout from school is significant at every \nlevel of schooling, even at the primary level where completion rates are near universal, and it has the largest effect on \nupper secondary dropout. Poverty directly, through out-of-pocket and opportunity costs, as well as indirectly, through \nfamily/parental background, affects children\u2019s educational outcomes.  Furthermore, educational quality as measured \nby examination results is significantly lower in rural areas and the quality of teaching influences parental decisions \nwhether to keep their children in school or not.   \n \nIn effect, poverty is an important factor in determining whether a child is enrolled in school or not.  Yet without \nunhampered access to quality education, opportunities for earning a reasonable income and rising above the poverty \nline are restricted: indeed, those with at least completed secondary education are significantly less likely to be poor. \n \n \nC.  Participation Process \nIs there a stakeholder analysis?    Yes     No  \nThe main institutional stakeholders include DVTE, MLSP, oblast (province) and raion (district) authorities (especially \nthose with an education department), PVS management, local employers, industry associations, private training \nproviders and civil society groups. The primary stakeholders are instructors, teachers and students.  \n \nIs there a participation strategy?     Yes                  No \nThe Project was designed in a participatory process involving major government and nongovernment stakeholders at \nnational and oblast level, school directors, instructors and teachers, students and parents, community leaders, private \ntraining providers, local employers and industry representatives from various trades, and development partners. \nParticipation  took  place  through  regular  consultations,  series  of  workshops  and  presentations.  During  the \nimplementation,  the  Project  will  maintain  broad  stakeholder  participation.  Nongovernmental  stakeholders  will \nparticipate In the Project Steering Committee and in the Selection Committee for school rehabilitation and up \ngradation. \n \nFurther, the Project will encourage (a) wide consultation in the development of new curriculum modules and training \nmaterials, (b) greater community and employer participation in supervising and ensuring the quality of (i) school \n ", "Appendix 9  59 \nrehabilitation work and equipment procurement and (ii) school facilities maintenance, and (iii) partnership between \nlocal employers and PVS in developing and delivering market-oriented training programmes for out-of school youth \nand adults.  \n \n \nD.  Gender Development \nStrategy to maximize impacts on gender: \nThe Kyrgyz Republic is a signatory to all important international labor conventions including those pertaining to child \nlabor and gender equality. No gender bias in access to general education exists in the Kyrgyz Republic. Children of \nboth genders have equal opportunity to receive basic education, which is granted free under the Constitution. \nTraditionally more male youth enroll in PVE than female.
