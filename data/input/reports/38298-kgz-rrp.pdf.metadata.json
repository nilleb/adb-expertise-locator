The  Project  has  four  components: \n(i) consolidation of the PVE system, (ii) improving teaching and learning \nenvironments,  (iii)  modernization  of  curriculum  and  assessment  and \ndevelopment  of \nresource \ndevelopment.  \n \n\nlearning  materials,  and \n\nin  reforming \n\n(iv)  human \n\nIn \n\nThe  economy  in  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  is  recovering  and  forecasts \nproject  an  average  GDP  growth  of  7.5%  for  the  period  2006\u20132010. \nWhile  the  Government  is  set  to  improve  the  enabling  conditions  for \nprivate  sector  growth,  lack  of  skilled  labor  is  a  key  issue  for  the \nbusiness  community. \nline  with  economic  growth  projections, \nfeedback from employers confirm the strong demand for quality skilled \nlabor  particular  for  (i)  service  sectors,  including  tourism,  information \ntechnologies and repair services; (ii)  construction related occupations, \nincluding  electricians,  welders,  plumbers,  carpenter,  and  bricklayers; \nand (iii) non-mining industries.  \n \nThe  current  vocational  education  system  that  is  largely  based  on  the \nformer  Soviet  system,  is  neither  responsive  to  labor  market  demands \nnor cost-effective. While there is a growing need for skilled workers in \nthe  formal  and  informal  labor  market,  graduates  from  vocational \nschools have difficulty finding jobs because they lack employable skills. \nThe key issues of the current vocational education system are (i) poor \nlinkages to the labor market, which results in poor quality and relevance \nof  training  courses,  (ii)  lack  of  practical  training  and  hands-on \nexperience for students, (iii) weak learning and teaching environment in \nschools, (iv) underutilized facilities and inefficient staff deployment, and \n(v) inefficient management of schools. \n \nIn  addition,  the  current  system  performs  poorly  in  terms  of  providing \nrelevant  quality  skills  training  for  adults  and  out-of-school  youth.  Most \nadults, particularly the poor in rural areas lack access to skills training \nthat  enhances  earning  capacity.  At  present,  the  provision  of  skills \ncourses  to  train  and  retrain  adults  is  limited  to  a  small  number  of  skill \nareas  mainly  in  urban  areas.  Only  a  few  private  training  providers  are \nengaged in vocational education and skills training.  \n\n\fii \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nIn  order  to  address  the  mismatch  in  the  labor  market  the  Project  will \nassist  the  Government  in  (i)  creating  flexible  mechanisms  with  active \nindustry  participation  to  regularly  adapt  training  programs  to  new \nbusiness circumstances,  (ii)  preparing  flexible  graduates  who  are  able \nto  adjust  to  changing  demands  in  the  labor  market  quickly,  and  (iii) \nconsolidating the current primary vocational education (PVE) system.  \n \nA  consolidated  and  modernized  PVE  system  will  improve  utilization  of \nfacilities and ensure a more efficient deployment of staff. Reorganized \nPVE  schools  with  efficient  staff  structures  will  be  more  flexible  to \nrespond to changing demands of labor market. The project will promote \nan entrepreneurial approach to managing schools and program delivery \nin  order  to  (i)  increase  income  generation  through  marketing  of  short \nterm skills training courses, selling of services and production of basic \ngoods,  and  (ii)  provide  an  environment  for  students  which  will \ndemonstrate the principles of entrepreneurship. \n \nAsian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB) assistance to the education sector in \nthe  Kyrgyz  Republic  has  evolved  since  the  mid  1990s  to  support  the \nGovernment  in  different  stages  of  reforming  and  strengthening  the \ngeneral  education  system.  The  Project  is  the  first  intervention  in  the \nvocational  education  sector.  By  reforming  the  current  PVE  system  to \nbecome  demand-driven  and  efficient,  the  Project  will  assist  the \nGovernment  in  complementing  the  transition  of  the  education  system \nfrom  the  Soviet  model  to  a  system  that  is  responsive  to  the \nrequirements  of  a  market-based  economy  and  consistent  with  the \ninternationally accepted education standards. \n \n\nThe  impact  of  the  Project  will  be  improved  employability  and  income-\nearning  opportunities  of  graduates  from  PVE.  The  project  outcome  is \nmore equitable access to and improved quality and relevance of PVE. \n \n\nThe total project cost is estimated at $13 million equivalent.  \n \n\n($ million) \n\nTotal \n\n            Total \n               10.00 \n                 3.00 \n               13.00 \n\nSource \nAsian Development Bank \nGovernment of the Kyrgyz Republic \n \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nTo further support project activities, Germany development cooperation \nthrough Deutsche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Technische Zusammenarbeit (GTZ), \nand  the  Swiss  Association  for  International  Cooperation  (HELVETAS) \nhave indicated that they would provide additional consulting inputs on a \ngrant basis. \n \n\n        Percent \n             77 \n             23 \n           100 \n\nADB  will  provide  a  grant  of  $10.0  million  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds \nresources  to  finance  77%  of  the  total  project  cost.

A project steering committee (PSC) \nwill  be  established  to  provide  strategic  guidance  and  monitor  the \nimplementation  of  the  Project.  The  PSC  will  be  chaired  by  the  Vice \nPrime Minister of the Kyrgyz Republic and consist of representatives of \nMLSP, Ministry of Economy and Finance, Office of the Prime Minister, \nChamber of Industry and Commerce, Confederation of Employers, and \nthe Civil Association Forum of Education Initiatives. The PSC will meet \nquarterly, or as often as required.  \n \nThe Project will be implemented through a project implementation unit \n(PIU), staffed by a project manager, a procurement specialist, a finance \nspecialist,  a  monitoring  and  evaluation \n(M&E)  specialist,  an \nadministrative assistant, an accountant, and part-time interpreters. The \nproject  manager  will  be  responsible  for  the  overall  implementation  of \nproject activities. The PIU will report to the project director and provide \nquarterly progress reports to the PSC, EA, and ADB.  \n \n\nGoods, works, and related services financed by ADB will be procured in \naccordance  with  its  Procurement  Guidelines  (April  2006,  as  amended \nfrom time to time). Procurement of civil works will be carried out through \nnational  competitive  bidding.  Procurement  of  equipment  will  be \nperformed \ninternational  competitive  bidding,  national \ncompetitive  bidding,  and  shopping.  Before  commencement  of \nprocurement,  ADB  and \nthe  recipient\u2019s \nprocurement procedures to ensure consistency with ADB requirements. \nAny necessary modifications or clarifications to the recipient procedures \nwill be documented in the procurement plan. \n \n\nthe  recipient  will  review \n\nthrough \n\nA total of 35 person-months of international and 107 person-months of \nnational  consulting  services  will  be  contracted  from  grant  funds  under \nthe four components. This will include experts in the field of vocational \neducation  and  skills  development \n(VESD)  policy  development, \norganizational  development,  curriculum  and  standards  development, \nentrepreneurship  promotion,  development  of \nlearning  materials, \nprocurement  of  training  equipment,  labor  market  assessment,  and \nlegislative  reform.  Consultants  will  be  recruited  in  accordance  with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants  (April 2006, as amended \nfrom time to time).  \n \n\nThe  Government  is  instituting  a  number  of  reforms  to  improve  the \nbusiness  climate,  and  create  a  supportive  enabling  framework  for  the \nprivate sector. Transforming the current PVE system\u2014from one that is \nsupply-driven  and  inefficient  to  one  attuned  to  labor  market  needs, \ncapable  of  producing  better  equipped  and  skilled  workers,  and \nproviding  training  and  retraining  opportunities  for  out-of-school  youth \nand  adults\u2014will  complement  the  Government\u2019s  strategic  thrust  to \npromote private sector growth. \n \nDirect  beneficiaries  of  the  Project  will  include  all  students  enrolled  in \n\niii \n\n \n\n\fiv \n\n \nRisks and \nAssumptions \n\nPVE  schools.  Nationwide,  about  24,300  students  (including  about \n10,000  students  from  poor  families)  will  benefit  from  new  demand-\noriented \nteaching \ntraining  programs,  modern  student-centered \ntechniques, and practical hands-on training in rehabilitated workshops. \n \nAt  the  end  of  the  Project,  more  than  6,000  adults  and  out-of-school \nyouth  will  benefit  from  relevant  short-term  skills  training  provided  by \nvocational schools.  \n \nAbout  1,300  instructors,  500  teachers,  and  200  school  managers  will \nbenefit from staff development programs conducted under the Project. \n \nThe  combined  effects  of  the  following  will  ensure  cost-effective \nimprovements \nin  providing  VESD  services:  (i)  restructuring  and \nrationalizing  the  current  PVE  system,  which  will  result  in  reduction  of \nexpenditures  and  more  efficient  utilization  of  funds,  infrastructure,  and \nhuman  resources;  and  (ii) applying  an  entrepreneurial  management \napproach  that  will  increase  revenue  generation  at  school  level. \nEstablishing strong links with industry/employers will make certain that \ntraining courses will be relevant, and increase job chances and income \nopportunities for graduates \n \nLabor  force  entrants  who  graduate  from  modernized  PVE  schools  will \npossess  knowledge  and  skills  in  line  with  market  requirements, \ncontribute  to  higher  labor  productivity,  and  increase  private  sector \ngrowth. \n \nSuccessful implementation of the Project rests on the assumption that \nthe  Government  will  (i)  maintain  the  high  commitment  to  reform  the \nPVE system and approve the strategy to consolidate the current school \nstructure;  (ii)  ensure  that  \u201cefficiency  gains\u201d  through  consolidation  and \nschool  mergers  will  be  kept  within  the  system  and  be  utilized  for \nincentive  schemes \nteachers,  purchase  of \ninstructors  and \nconsumables  required  to  conduct  practical  training,  and  investment  in \nnew  equipment;  (iii)  provide  adequate  budget  for  operation  and \nmaintenance of rehabilitated schools; and (iv) in-service training for all \ninstructors.  To  achieve  its  impact,  the  Project  assumes  that  further \nsteady economic growth will create new job opportunities. \n \nProject  risks  include  (i)  limited  institutional  capacity  of  the  EA,  (ii) \nresistance  of  school  staff  in  the  process  of  restructuring  the  PVE \nsystem,  and  (iii)  adequate  provision  of  funds  for  operation  and \nmaintenance (O&M). \n \nThe  managerial  and  technical  capacities  of  the  MLSP  and  PVE \ninstitutions  are  limited  and  might  affect  the  smooth  implementation  of \nthe  consolidation  strategy.  The  risk  will  be  mitigated  through  capacity \nbuilding  within  the  Department  of  Vocational  Education  and  Training \n(DVET) under the MLSP. At the school level, the Project will strengthen \nmanagement  capacities  of  school  principals  and  provide  training  for \ninstructors, curriculum developers and teachers. \n \n \n\nfor \n\n\f \n\nThe  impact  of  school  mergers  and  the  introduction  of  a  new \nentrepreneurial  culture  and  uniform  assessments,  will  be  significant. \nRisks include resistance from instructors, teachers and school directors \nto  accept  changes.  The  risks  will  be  mitigated  by  adopting  a \nparticipatory  approach  to  project  implementation  that  actively  involves \nschool directors, instructors, and teachers.  \n \nFinancial  risks \nthe  provision  of \nincremental  recurrent  costs  for  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  of \nrehabilitated  schools.  To  mitigate  risks  of  insufficient  public  funds  for \nO&M, the Project\u2019s strategy aims at reducing the dependency on public \nallocations \nthrough  promoting  an  entrepreneurial  approach  and \nstrengthening income generation at PVS level. \n\ninvolve  potential  difficulties \n\nin \n\nv \n\n

\n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed grant \n\n1. \nto the Kyrgyz Republic for the Vocational Education and Skills Development (VESD) Project.  \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\n \n2. \nIn 2004, the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic requested the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB)  to  provide  technical  assistance  (TA)  to  support  reforming  and  modernizing  the  current \nsystem  for  primary  vocational  education  and  prepare  the  VESD  Project  (the  Project).1  In \naccordance  with  the  Government\u2019s  development  strategy,  the  Project  is  included  in  the  country \nstrategy  and  program  update  2006\u20132008.2  The  project  design  and  monitoring  framework  is  in \nAppendix 1. \n \nA. \n \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n1. \n\nSocioeconomic Context \n\n \n3. \nIn 2003\u20132005, annual economic growth was 4.4% on average, per capita gross domestic \nproduct (GDP) increased from $384 to $475, and real incomes of population have grown over the \nlast  3  years  by  5%  on  average.  However,  about  37%  of  the  population  still  lives  below  the \nnational poverty line ($225 per year) and about 13% are considered to be extremely poor (income \nless than $140 per year). The experience of the Kyrgyz Republic suggests that economic growth \ndoes not immediately translate into poverty reduction; the benefits of GDP growth are not equally \ndistributed among the population, as revealed by income inequality. \n \n4. \nIn  2005,  the  estimated  population  of  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  was  about  5.1  million,  with  a \npopulation growth rate of about 1.1%. The Kyrgyz Republic has a relatively young, economically \nactive population\u2014about 56% of the total population is of working age and 45% of the population \nis from 5 to 19 years of age. Over the next 4 years, about 115,000 to 120,000 young people per \nyear will enter the labor market, which will need to absorb an additional 4% of the working age \npopulation.3 At the same time, despite economic growth, registered unemployment rose to 10% in \n2005.  However,  official  data  provide  only  a  partial  picture  of  the  unemployment  problem;  more \ncomprehensive figures suggest that the unemployment rate is almost 20% of the workforce. As in \nother former Soviet economies, a large number of those without work do not register themselves \nas  unemployed,  given  the  negligible  benefits  available  and  limited  usefulness  of  state \nunemployment  services.  The  number  of  underemployed  could  be  even  higher,  given  that  many \npeople  who  are  technically  \u201cemployed\u201d  are  actually  working  part-time  in  the  informal  sector. \nUnemployment  among  youth  remains  one  of  the  most  problematic  issues\u2014over  50%  of  the \nunemployed are under 30 years old. \n \n5. \nThe  collapse  of  public  industries  after  1991,  combined  with  lack  of  access  to  effective \nsocial  security  payments  and  lack  of  formal  employment  opportunities,  has  contributed  to  the \nemergence  of  a  widespread  informal  sector  in  the  Kyrgyz  Republic.  Based  on  the  Household \nSurvey carried out by the National Statistical Committee in 2004, it is  estimated that more than \n50%  of  the  economically  active  population  is  employed  or  self-employed  in  the  informal  sector, \n\n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2005. Technical Assistance to the Kyrgyz Republic for Preparing the Vocational Education and Skills Training \n\nProject. Manila. \n\n2   ADB.  2005.  Country  Strategy  and  Program  Update  (2006\u20132008):  Kyrgyz  Republic.  Manila.  During  the  Country \nStrategy and Programming (CSP) Mission in October 2005, the Government and ADB agreed to finance the ensuing \nproject from grant funds. \n\n3   About 24,000 workers per year will exit the labor market during the same period. \n\n\f2 \n\n2.  \n\nEducation Sector \n\nmainly engaged in agriculture and trade-related activities. Employment in the agriculture sector is \ndisproportionately  high.  While  agriculture  contributes  only  one  third  of  GDP,  around  50%  of  the \nworkforce was employed in the sector in 2004.  \n \n \n \n6. \nThe  education  system  in  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  follows  the  Soviet  model  and  comprises \n(i) pre-schooling; (ii) 11 years of general education, including primary education from grades 1\u20134, \nlower  secondary  from  grades  5\u20139,  and  upper  secondary  education  from  grades  10\u201311; \n(iii) primary vocational education (PVE); (iv) secondary vocational education (SVE); and (v) higher \neducation. Primary and lower secondary education is compulsory. The constitution stipulates free \nbasic education (grades 1\u20139) to all children. In 2003, net enrollment was 98.6% in primary grades \nand 72.2% in upper secondary grades. The Ministry of Education (MOE) is responsible for setting \neducation policy and standards in general education, and controls implementation through oblast \n(province) and raion (district) departments of education. The structure of the education system is \nin Appendix 2. \n \nThe  Kyrgyz  Republic  has  two  separate  systems  of  vocational  education:  PVE  and  SVE. \n7. \nSVE is provided by various ministries and agencies, which offer programs at the post-school level \nbut below the level of higher education. The SVE institutions do not represent a \u201csystem\u201d in the \nsame  way  as  the  other  sectors  of  education.  In  total,  70  institutions  offer  SVE  programs4  and \nabout 27,000 students were enrolled in 2005. No comprehensive tracer studies are available but \nanecdotal  evidence  suggests  that  a  large  number  of  SVE  graduates  have  difficulties  finding \nemployment after course completion. Linkages among SVE institutions and between SVE, PVE, \nand  industry  are  weak.  A  comprehensive  VESD  policy\u2014linked  to  a  national  human  resource \ndevelopment plan and to present and future labor market needs\u2014is not in place. \n \n \n \nThe  PVE  system  was  developed  under  the  Soviet  era  to  become  a  principal  training \n8. \nnetwork  for  skilled  workers,  and  was  well  linked  to  industry  needs.  Many  primary  vocational \nschools (PVSs) were located next to large factories and specialized in providing qualified workers \nfor  particular  trades.  At  its  height,  the  PVE  system  provided  training  for  up  to  90,000  students. \nHowever,  after  1991,  PVE  has  become  one  of  the  most  neglected  areas  of  education  in  the \nKyrgyz  Republic.  The  Government  reduced  its  support  significantly\u2014funds  for  operation  and \nmaintenance  and  reinvestment  in  training  equipment  decreased,  buildings  deteriorated,  and \nenrollment fell substantially. \n \n9. \nAt  present,  the  PVE  system  is  administered  by  the  Department  for  Vocational  Training \nand Education (DVTE) under the Ministry of Labor and Social Protection (MLSP), and consists of \n112 PVSs. In 2005, 24,148 students were enrolled in PVSs, of which 36% were female students. \nAccording  to  DVTE  data,  about  10,000  students  are  from  low-income  families.  Anecdotal \nevidence  and  surveys  in  rural  areas  suggest  that  the  number  of  poor  students  is  much  higher, \nand  up  to  70%  of  PVE  students  belong  to  poor  families.  Currently,  PVSs  offer  three  types  of \ncourses: (i) three-year programs combine a vocational specialty with general education, providing \nstudents with the necessary certificate to study further in a higher education institution. More than \nhalf of PVE students are enrolled in the 3-year program; (ii) two-year programs are designed for \n\nPrimary Vocational Education \n\n3. \n\n                                                 \n4  Sponsors  of  SVE  institutions  include:  MOE  (22  SVE  institutions),  Ministry  of  Health  (10),  State  Commission  on \nCulture  (9),  Ministry  of  Labor  and  Social  Protection  (MLSP)  (3),  Kyrgyz  Union  of  Consumers  (2),  Ministry  of \nEconomics  and  External  Trade  (1),  State  Commission  Tourism  and  Sports  (1),  Ministry  of  Interior  (1),  Ministry  of \nTransport  (1),  Association  of  Cooperatives  (1),  SVE  institutes  attached  to  Higher  Education  Institutions  (11),  and \nprivate institutions (8). \n\n\f1. \n\nKey Issues and Challenges \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\nstudents  from  grade  9  and  provide  vocational  education  with  some  general  education,  but  this \nprogram does not provide the general education components required for higher education; and \n(iii) 10-month  courses  that  strictly  target  vocational  skills,  and  are  marketed  to  both  youth  and \nadults. In addition, some PVSs offer short-term skills courses for adults, mainly sponsored by the \nEmployment Services. However, in 2005, only about 500 adults were enrolled in short courses. A \ndescription of the PVE system is in Appendix 3. \n \n10. \nPublic  expenditure  on  education  has  been  on  average  about  4%  of  GDP  for  the  past \n3 years  (4.12%  in  2005).  PVE\u2019s  share  of  the  education  budget  is  low\u20146.6%  in  2005.5  In  2005, \n45% of the PVE budget was spent on salaries and allocations to the social fund; 31% for social \nprotection,  including  school  food  and  student  allowances;  11%  for  heating,  electricity,  water \nsupply,  and  other  utilities;  and  only  13%  remained  for  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  of \nschool facilities, provision of training materials, and investment in new equipment. In 2005, about \n12% of the total budget was generated by schools\u2019 income earning activities of schools. This was \nmainly spent on incentive schemes for instructors and teachers to improve their low salaries, and \nthe  purchase  of  urgently  needed  consumables  and  materials  for  training  courses.  The \nGovernment  has  indicated  that  it  will  increase  PVE  funding  during  2006\u20132008.  However,  its \ncommitment  to  meet  salaries  and  provide  social  protection  will  continue  to  absorb  most  of  the \nannual PVE budget. A description of PVE financing is in Appendix 4. \n \nB. \n \n \n \n11. \nReform  Context.  Private  sector  growth  and  the  level  of  investments  are  both  rising  in \n2006. After the 2005 political turmoil that led to a fall of 0.6% in GDP, the economy is recovering; \nestimates  by  the  International  Monetary  Fund  (IMF)  and  the  Ministry  of  Economy  and  Finance \nforecast average GDP growth of 7.5% for the period 2006\u20132010. According to these projections, \nthe  construction  sector  is  expected  to  grow  annually  at  13%  on  average,  industry  production \n(excluding mining) at 9.4%, service sector at 8.2%, and agriculture at a slower pace of 4.5%. To \nstimulate  sustainable  economic  growth  further  and  create  employment  opportunities,  the \nGovernment has launched a series of reforms, including improving governance, introducing a flat \ncorporate  and  personal  income  tax,  simplifying  tax  administration,  improving  access  to  financial \nservices, streamlining operational licensing, and strengthening the enforcement of contracts.  \n \n12. \nDynamic Labor Sectors. While the Government is set to improve the enabling conditions \nfor private sector growth, lack of qualified personnel is a key issue for the business community. In \nthe absence of reliable labor market information and employment forecasts, possible information \non  skill  requirements  was  gathered  through  focus  group  discussions  with  local  employers, \nfarmers,  and  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs)  at  raion  level;  and  feedback  from  the \nChamber  of  Industry  and  Commerce  and  its  regional  offices,  National  State  Committee  for \nMigration  and  Employment  (NSCME)  and  its  oblast  offices,  and  MLSP.  In  line  with  economic \ngrowth  projections,  the  feedback  from  employers,  NGOs,  NSCME,  and  chamber  members \nconfirmed the strong demand for quality skilled labor in the service and construction sectors and \nnon-mining  industries.  The  construction  sector  is  expected  to  grow  in  line  with  the  rapid \ndevelopment  for  new  housing  and  increased  road  construction.  Quality  skilled  workers  in \nconstruction-related  occupations  will  be  in  demand,  including  electricians,  welders,  plumbers, \ncarpenters,  and  bricklayers.  The  service  sector,  accounting  for  45%  of  GDP,  will  account  for \nsubstantial  job  growth.  Employment  potential  and  income  earning  opportunities  are  expected  in \n\n                                                 \n5  In 2005, the total budget for PVE was at about $7.9 million\u2014$6.9 million through public allocations and $1.0 million \n\nfrom income generation from schools. \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\nfor \n\ntelecommunications  services, \n\nskill  areas  related  to  repair  of  vehicles  and  home  appliances.  Tourism  is  estimated  to  expand \nfollowing the success of the Government in attracting a growing number of visitors annually, and \nrecent  developments  of  the  tourist  infrastructure.  Job  growth  will  be  concentrated  in  food \nservices,  hotel  management,  recreation,  and  entertainment  activities.  IT-service  industries  are \nexpected  to  grow  over  the  medium  term,  stimulating  jobs  for  office  and  management  services. \nInternet  connections,  and  software \nIncreased  demand \napplications  will  further  stimulate  job  opportunities  among  these  industries.  Industry  production \n(excluding  mining)  will  require  broad  skilled  labor  in  small  and  medium-sized  enterprises.6  The \nGovernment  also  highlights  the  potential  of  the  textile  sector,  which  provides  additional  income \nearning opportunities in rural areas. Increases in population and personal income will contribute \nto employment growth in retail trade, as consumers demand more goods. \n \n13.  While  by  far  the  largest  source  of  employment,  the  capacity  of  the  agriculture  sector  to \ncreate additional employment is limited. To improve productivity and income opportunities in the \nsector,  workers  will  need  to  diversify  and  upgrade  their  skills  in  agro-processing.  A  growing \nnumber  of  workers  engaged  in  farming  activities  are  seeking  retraining  opportunities  to  acquire \nskills  to  improve  employability  in  other  sectors.  Many  school  graduates  will  seek  jobs  or  self-\nemployment  opportunities  in  the  informal  sector  because  of  limited  formal  employment \nopportunities. The ability to be flexible, identify business opportunities, and respond to local labor \nmarket  demands  in  a  timely  manner  will  increase  their  income  prospects.  Entrepreneurial, \nmultiskilled labor will have comparative advantages. \n \n14. \nPoor  Quality  and  Relevance.  Feedback  from  employers  revealed  that  the  current  PVE \nsystem is not able to respond adequately to emerging labor market needs. Many PVE graduates \nand most unemployed lack practical skills required by enterprises, and up-to-date knowledge in \ntheir  areas  of  specialization;  and  do  not  have  sufficient  understanding  of  entrepreneurial \nprinciples.  Graduates  who  have  found  employment  have  had  to  undergo  additional  training  by \ntheir  employers.  Anecdotal  evidence  revealed  that,  in  small  towns  and  villages,  qualified \nplumbers,  electricians,  and  welders  are  not  available;  construction  companies  need  to  hire \nlaborers from abroad because of lack of qualified national workers; and tourism and IT companies \ncomplain about under-qualified PVE graduates and unfit job applicants. The quality and relevance \nof  PVE  programs  suffers  from  weak  interaction  with  the  private  sector  and  lack  of  systematic \nlabor market research. Although some PVSs have developed good linkages with local companies \nand provide relevant skills training, the majority of training programs are largely supply-driven and \noften based on allocated budgets and available staff and equipment rather than market demand.  \n \nPoor  Facilities.  The  essence  of  vocational  education  and  skills  training  is  relevant \n15. \npractical training and hands-on experience for students. However, poor infrastructure and lack of \nadequate training equipment in most PVSs mean that students learn about skills in theory but are \nnot able to put those skills into practice. The building construction and technology of PVSs which \nhave  not  yet  benefited  from  rehabilitation  measures  are  based  on  30-year  old  construction \nstandards  that  are  inefficient  in  terms  of  use  of  materials,  structural  capacity,  and  energy \nperformance.  PVS  facilities  continue  to  deteriorate  because  of  inadequate  maintenance  and \ninvestment. Training workshops and dormitories are in poor condition. Most training equipment in \nPVSs was supplied during the Soviet era and is outdated or not functioning and only displayed for \ndemonstration  purposes.  Hand  tools,  sufficient  consumables,  teaching  aids,  and  learning \nmaterials are lacking in training workshops.  \n \nQualification of Instructors and Teachers. The teaching techniques and technical skills \n16. \nand  knowledge  of  most  instructors  and  teachers  are  outdated  and  need  to  be  upgraded.  Many \n\n                                                 \n6 The share of small and medium sized enterprises in the GDP grew to 47% in 2005. \n\n\finstructors focus on delivering content, as specified in their curriculum, and not on achieving the \nperformance expected for employment. Under the Soviet system, teachers received periodic in-\nservice training, which has since diminished because of limited resources.  \n \n17. \nCurriculum  Development  and  Learning  Materials.  Industry  involvement  in  curriculum \ndevelopment  is  limited  and  current  curriculum  modules  are  not  revised  regularly  to  reflect \nchanging  technology  and  market  demands.  The  curriculum  needs  to  be  adjusted  to  incorporate \nstudent-centered, modern teaching methods with emphasis on practical training. To enhance the \nflexibility  of  graduates  to  respond  to  labor  market  demands  in  a  timely  manner,  a  modernized \ncurriculum  should  aim  at  providing  multi-skills  training  and  include  entrepreneurial  skills. \nTextbooks  and  learning  and  teaching  materials  are  seriously  outdated.  A  new,  decentralized \napproach in training material development\u2014involving teachers, instructors, and experts from the \nprivate  sector\u2014is  required  to  produce  modern  learning  materials  for  students,  promoting \nindependent learning and practical workshop experience.  \n \n18.  Weak Assessment. Currently, there is no comprehensive assessment system based on \nagreed skills standards in place. The quality of skills training depends on the quality of instruction, \nwhich is often adversely affected by lack of training equipment, poor teaching environment, and \noutdated  knowledge  of  teachers.  Schools  set  their  own  examination,  without  formal  external \nquality control or moderation. At present, industry is only involved occasionally in preparing and \nparticipating in examinations.  \n \n19. \nLow  Efficiency.  The  average  size  of  PVSs,  in  terms  of  enrollments,  is  very  small.  This \nraises  a  number  of  issues.  The  PVE  system  was  originally  designed  for  90,000  students. \nHowever,  many  classrooms,  training  workshops,  and  dormitories  are  largely  underutilized \nbecause  of  the  sharp  decrease  in  enrollment.  Schools  with  low  enrollment  have  considerably \nhigher  training  unit  costs  than  schools  with  higher  student  enrollment.  Because  of  lack  of  an \nassets management strategy and restrictive legal and administrative regulations, DVTE is not in a \nposition  to  manage  its  complex  range  of  assets  efficiently.  The  staff  composition  of  the  PVE \nsystem  is  inefficient.  Senior  staff  is  too  thinly  spread  and  the  ratio  of  nonteaching  staff  to \nadministrative and management staff is unbalanced\u2014of about 7,400 staff engaged in PVS, only \nabout 20% are skill instructors and 13% are general education teachers; the remaining 67% are \nmanagers,  administrators,  and  support  staff.  Consolidation  of  the  current  system  is  necessary, \nincluding  merging  selected  PVSs,  to  improve  utilization  of  facilities  and  ensure  more  efficient \ndeployment  of  staff.  Reorganized  and  consolidated  PVSs  with  efficient  staff  structures  will  be \nmore flexible to respond to changing demands of the labor market. \n \n20. \nTraining Provision for Adults. The current system performs poorly in terms of providing \nmarket-oriented skills training for adults and out-of-school youth. Most adults, particularly the poor \nin rural areas, lack access to skills training that would enhance their earning capacity. Relevant \nshort-term training programs are offered in a limited manner by public training institutions and a \nfew private providers, mainly in urban areas. Currently, no skills development strategy is in place \nto address adult training and retraining needs. \n \n\n2. \n\nGovernment Policy \n\n \n21. \nThe Comprehensive Development Framework (CDF), Millennium Development Goals for \neducation,  and  Country  Development  Strategy  for  2007\u20132010  currently  under  preparation, \ndescribe the Government\u2019s development strategy. The overarching goal of the CDF is to achieve \npolitical and social well-being, economic prosperity of the people of the Kyrgyz Republic, together \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\nwith  freedom,  human  dignity,  and  equal  opportunities  for  all.7  The  Government  considers \nreforming  the  current  PVE  system  an  integral  part  of  its  (i)  economic  growth  strategy,  aimed  at \nsteady,  private  sector-led  growth;  (ii)  social  strategy,  aimed  at  improving  access  of  the  poor  to \nincome generating opportunities; and (iii) approach to remove disparities between rural and urban \nregions and improve living conditions in rural areas. \n \n22. \nThe Law on Education, the Education Development Concept until 2010, and the National \nAction  Plan  on  Education  for  All  (EFA)  describe  the  Government\u2019s  policy  and  strategies  in  the \neducation  sector.  Strengthening  vocational  education  and  developing  an  adult  education  and \ntraining system are considered key development areas in the National Plan of Action on EFA. \n \n\n3. \n\nExternal Assistance to the Sector \n\n \nADB  has  been  the  major  development  partner  in  the  education  sector  since  the  mid-\n23. \n1990s. Complementing ADB\u2019s support to the education sector, the World Bank provided a grant \nof  $15.5  million  in  2005  to  support  rural  basic  education.  The  Organization  of  the  Petroleum \nExporting Countries (OPEC) Fund supported initial improvements of general education services. \nThe  United  States  Agency  for  International  Development  (USAID)  supports  legal  reforms, \ncapacity  building,  improvement  of  selected  curriculum  areas,  teacher  training,  and  community \nparticipation  in  rural  basic  education.  The  Soros  Foundation  supports  teacher  training  and \nlearning development and overseas scholarships. The United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF) \nprovides  assistance  in  capacity  development  of  local  administrators  and  policy  development  in \ngeneral  education.  The  United  Nations  Educational,  Scientific  and  Cultural  Organization \n(UNESCO) promotes the EFA strategy. Save the Children supports nonformal education for poor \nchildren.  With  the  exception  of  the  assistance  provided  by  ADB  and  the  World  Bank,  inputs  by \nthese  agencies  have  been  relatively  modest  in  financial  terms  and  mainly  target  general \neducation. \n \n24. \nThe  major  development  partners  in  vocational  education  are  Swiss  Association  for \nInternational Cooperation (HELVETAS) and German development cooperation through Deutsche \nGesellschaft  f\u00fcr  Technische  Zusammenarbeit  (GTZ).  Swiss  Association  for  International \nCooperation (HELVETAS) has been active in agricultural training and supports selected PVSs in \nrural areas. It has developed a large number of excellent training materials; and provides training \nfor teachers, instructors, and school principles on modern teaching methods and entrepreneurial \nmanagement  approaches.  Germany  (GTZ)  has  provided  support  to  PVE  since  the  end  of  the \n1990s. GTZ focuses on curriculum development for selected trades, supports the establishment \nof  a  national  policy  framework  for  VESD,  and  promotes  training  and  retraining  opportunities  for \nadults. In addition, the International Labour Organization (ILO) has developed an entrepreneurial \ntraining package which has been piloted at some PVSs.  \n \n\n4. \n\nADB\u2019s Sector Strategy \n\n \n25. \nADB\u2019s  country  strategy  and  program  update  (2006\u20132008)  highlights  the  importance  of \nreducing  poverty  by  promoting  private  sector-led  economic  growth  and  human  resource \ndevelopment,  including  promoting  general  and  vocational  education.  ADB  assistance  to  the \neducation  sector  in  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  has  evolved  since  the  mid-1990s  to  support  the \nGovernment in different stages of reforming and strengthening the education system. Assistance \nincluded program and project loans for the Education Sector Development Program8 approved in \n1997,  which  supported policy  reforms  and  initial  improvements  in delivering  education  services. \n                                                 \n7  Kyrgyz Republic. 2001.

Manila. \n\n\fBuilding  on  lessons  and  achievements  from  the  Education  Sector  Development  Program,  the \nSecond  Education  Project9  was  approved  in  2005.  The  Second  Education  Project  supports  the \nGovernment\u2019s  efforts  in  modernizing  the  curriculum,  strengthening  teacher  training,  promoting \nincentive schemes for teachers in rural areas, and rehabilitating and upgrading rural schools. The \nSocial  Services  Development  and  Finance  Project,10  approved  in  1998,  provided  support  for \nrehabilitating  education  and  health  facilities  in  Jalal-Abad  and  Osh  oblasts.  The  Community-\nBased  Early  Childhood  Development  Project,11  which  was  approved  in  2003,  focuses  on \nimproving health, nutrition, and educational development for children below 8 years of age in the \n12 poorest raions of the country.  \n \n26. \nThe VESD Project is ADB\u2019s first intervention in vocational education. The Project\u2019s focus \nis  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Education.12  Activities  are  aimed  at  reducing  poverty  and \nproviding knowledge and skills essential to meet the needs of a demand-driven modern economy. \nThe  Project  will  address  unemployment  issues  caused  by  a  mismatch  between  existing \nknowledge and skills and labor market needs, which is considered a major cause of poverty. \n \n\n5. \n\nLessons \n\n \n27. \nReform  of  the  current  PVE  system  will  complement  ADB\u2019s  development  assistance, \nsupporting the Government in completing the transition of the education system from the Soviet \nmodel  to  a  modern  demand-driven  system  consistent  with  internationally  accepted  education \nstandards and labor market needs. As this is ADB\u2019s first intervention in the vocational education \nsector, the project design takes into consideration experiences from other development partners, \nparticularly GTZ and HELVETAS, that indicate the urgent need to (i) consolidate and rationalize \nthe  existing  PVE  structure;  (ii)  launch  an  entrepreneurial  culture  in  school  management  and \ndelivery  of  training  programs;  (iii)  introduce  new  teaching  techniques  and  upgrade  training \nworkshops  and  equipment \ninvolve \nto  strengthen  practical,  hands-on \ncommunities and employers to strengthen the quality and relevance of training programs. Another \nlesson relates to the importance of donor coordination to generate synergies. The project design \nwill  involve  key  development  partners  in  steering  and  coordination  committees  to  improve \nharmonization and information sharing.  \n \n\ntraining;  and  (iv) \n\nIII.  \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\nThe \n\nimpacts  of \n\nthe  Project  will  be \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nimproved  employability  and \n\n \nA. \n \n28. \nincome-earning \nopportunities of graduates from PVE, and strengthened private sector-led economic growth. The \nexpected  project  outcome  is  more  equitable  access  to  and  improved  quality  and  relevance  of \nvocational education and skills training. \n \nB. \n\nOutputs \n \n29. \nThe Project has four components: (i) consolidation and modernization of the PVE system, \n(ii)  improving  teaching  and  learning  environments,  (iii)  modernizing  curriculum  and  learning \nassessment and developing learning materials, and (iv) human resource development. \n                                                 \n9  ADB.  2005.

Under \ncomponent 1, the Project will provide assistance in (i) consolidating and modernizing the current \nPVE  structure  gradually;  (ii)  creating  a  legal  and  administrative  framework  conducive  to  enable \nschool  management  to  engage  in  entrepreneurial  activities  and  administer  their  assets  and \nincome; and (iii) developing a national policy framework for VESD linking PVE, SVE, and private \ntraining  provision.  The  Project  will  address  policy  issues  to  enhance  the  contribution  of  private \ntraining  provision  by  creating  incentives  and  ensuring  that  the  regulatory  framework  does  not \nraise unreasonable barriers to entry. \n \n31. \nConsolidation  and  Restructuring.  The  Project  will  support  the  Government  in \ndeveloping  and  implementing  a  strategy  to  consolidate  assets  and  staff  structure  of  the  current \n112  PVE  schools.  Based  on  a  comprehensive  review  of  the  existing  school  structure,  labor \nmarket assessments, and enrollment trends, \u201ccomplex schools\u201d13 will be established by merging \nselected  schools.  PVSs  that  will  not  participate  in  mergers  will  be  restructured  to  enhance  the \nefficiency  and  improve  the  relevance  and  quality  of  training  programs.  A  reformed  system  will \nimprove  utilization  of  existing  classrooms,  training  workshops,  dormitories,  and  equipment; \nensure  more  efficient  deployment  of  staff;  and  strengthen  training  provision  in  rural  areas. \nInternational  and  national  consultants  will  provide  support  in  developing  and  implementing  a \nstrategy  to  consolidate  the  PVE  system  step-by-step,  including  reforming  legal,  regulatory,  and \nadministrative arrangements. \n \n32. \nTo  improve  the  flexibility  of  the  PVE  system  to  adjust  training  programs  to  changing \nrequirements of the labor market in a timely manner, the Project will assist MLSP in strengthening \nlabor  market  research  and  employment  forecasts.  Results  of  labor  market  assessments  will  be \nregularly  reviewed  by  the  NSCME,  Chamber  of  Industry  and  Commerce,  and  selected  industry \nrepresentatives  to  guide  curriculum  development.  Arrangements  to  establish  a  regular  review \nmechanism  will  be  formalized  within  6  months  of  grant  effectiveness.  To  further  strengthen  the \nrelevance and quality of training programs, complex schools and other PVSs will establish school \nadvisory boards consisting of local employers and civil society representatives. Advisory boards \nwill  (i)  guide  school  management  in  developing  annual  business  plans,  (ii)  support  schools  in \nidentifying  skill  demands  and  adjusting  training  programs  accordingly,  (iii)  participate  in  the \nmoderation  of  training  courses  and  examinations,  and  (iv)  promote  on-the-job  training  and \napprenticeship opportunities. The Project will provide support in preparing detailed procedures for \nthe  operation  of  advisory  boards,  which  will  be  formalized  by  MLSP  within  6  months  of  grant \neffectiveness. \n \n33. \nCurrently, DVTE has at its disposal a complex range of assets, including buildings, land, \nand  equipment.  Much  of  the  equipment  is  not  functioning  or  outdated;  many  buildings  are \nunderutilized and have major defects. The Project will help to improve the management of these \nresources, and assist in setting up an assets management system and legal and administrative \nframework which will allow selling, renting out, or closing down assets, with proceeds to be used \nwithin the PVE system.  \n \n\n                                                 \n13 A \u201ccomplex school\u201d will consist of a number of merged schools under one management, with infrastructure and staff \n\non a shared basis. \n\n\f34. \nEntrepreneurial Culture. At the school level, the Project will promote an entrepreneurial \napproach  to  managing  schools  and  program  delivery  to  (i)  increase  income  generation  through \nmarketing  short-term  skills  training  courses  for  out-of-school  youth  and  adults,  selling  services, \nand  producing  basic  goods;  and  (ii)  provide  an  environment  for  students  that  demonstrates  the \nprinciples  of  entrepreneurship.  Students  who  will  seek  jobs  in  the  informal  sector  or  as  self-\nemployed, will benefit from a learning environment that practices and teaches entrepreneurship. \nThe  Project  will  (i)  provide  training  to  school  principals  and  administrators  to  strengthen  their \nmanagement  capabilities;  (ii)  support  instructors  to  adjust  training  programs  based  on  demand \nassessments;  and  (iii)  assist  curriculum  developers,  instructors,  and  teachers  to  incorporate \nentrepreneurial  skills  in  curriculum  modules.  The  Project  will  help  to  revise  administrative \nregulations to allow PVSs to manage income for the benefit of their schools. \n \n35. \nCertification.  As  part  of  the  modernization  process,  the  Project  will  provide  support  to \nestablish a certification scheme with appropriate mechanisms for skills assessments. Certificates \nwill  be  issued  to  students  and  workers  who  will  pass  examinations  and  skills  assessments \nconducted  jointly  with  the  private  sector.  Assessment  centers  will  be  established  at  selected \ncomplex schools.  \n \n36. \nCareer  Guidance.  The  Project  will  support  the  establishment  of  mechanisms  to  inform \nstudents  from  grades  9  to  11  and  their  parents  about  income  earning  and  employment \nopportunities of PVE graduates. A professional media company will be engaged to prepare and \nconduct awareness campaigns. A time-bound action plan will be developed during the first year \nof project implementation. Qualified staff from MLSP and selected teachers and instructors from \nschools will be trained in counseling methods and networking with employers. \n \n37. \nSkills  Training  and  Retraining  for  Adults.  At  present,  the  provision  of  skills  training \ncourses  to  train  and  retrain  adults  and  out-of-school  youth  is  limited  to  a  small  number  of  skill \nareas  and  offered  by  only  a  few  training  providers,  mainly  in  urban  areas.  To  promote \nemployment  and  income  earning  opportunities  for  unemployed  and  underemployed  adults  and \nyouth,  the  Project  will  provide  support  in  increasing  the  availability  of  relevant  short-term  skills \ntraining  courses.  Based  on  the  results  of  labor  market  surveys  and  employment  forecasts,  the \nProject  will  assist  in  developing  short-term  courses  to  be  conducted  at  complex  schools  and \nPVSs during evenings, weekends, and school holidays. The Project will also develop strategies to \nstimulate private training provision.  \n \n\n2. \n\nComponent 2:  Improving Teaching and Learning Environments in PVSs  \n\n \n38. \nOnce an approved consolidation strategy is in place, the Project will provide assistance to \nimprove the teaching and learning environment in schools. This will include (i) rehabilitation and \nupgrading  of  training  workshops  of  up  to  20  selected  PVSs,  (ii)  rehabilitation  of  up  to \n20 dormitories, and (iii) provision of training equipment for basic priority skill areas14 that offer the \nbest employment prospects for students. The Project will also provide 14 mobile training units to \nservice remote rural areas. \n \nRehabilitation priorities include: (i) provision of adequate heating systems and insulation; \n39. \n(ii) improvement of roof structures; (iii) repair of sanitation systems; (iv) repair of defective walls \nand  ceilings;  and  (v)  replacement  of  damaged  floors,  doors,  windows.  To  improve  access  for \ndisabled  students  who  may  have  faced  exclusion,  rehabilitation  works  will  include  provision  of \nfacilities  for  wheelchair-bound  students,  adjusted  and  accessible  furniture,  equipment,  and \n\n                                                 \n14 Skills  areas  include:  (i)  agriculture,  (ii)  basic  IT  services,  (iii)  automotive,  (iv)  carpentry,  (v)  welding,  (vi)  electrical, \n\n(vii) metalwork, (viii) garments, and (ix) hospitality. \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\nimproved sanitary facilities. To improve teaching conditions, the Project will provide teaching aids \nto each rehabilitated workshop. School management and community members will be involved in \nthe planning of rehabilitation works, and participate in the day-to-day supervision to make certain \nthat contractors implement rehabilitation works as specified in the contracts. \n \nOnce the consolidation strategy is approved, packages of new training equipment will be \n40. \nprovided  to  selected  PVSs,  including  equipment  for  (i)  benchwork,  (ii)  carpentry,  (iii)  basic \ninformation  and  communication \ntechnology  (ICT),  (iv) construction  works  (masonry  and \nbricklaying),  (v)  agriculture,  (vi)  cooking,  (vii)  electrical  and  electronics,  (viii)  heavy  and  light \nvehicle  repair,  and  (ix)  welding  (arc  and  gas).  To  start  practical  training,  each  rehabilitated  and \nupgraded training workshop will be provided with a lump sum for consumables and materials to \nsupport the first year of its operation. In the following years, schools will finance procurement of \nconsumables and materials from their own income generation. \n \n41. \nThe selection mechanism to identify schools for rehabilitation and training equipment will \nbe  based  on  a  competitive  and  demand-oriented  approach.  Schools  will  be  invited  to  submit  a \nproposal, including a business plan, that will provide information on (i) planned training courses, \nnumber of potential participants, and income earning opportunities for skills trained; (ii) availability \nof  qualified  teachers  and  instructors;  (iii)  partnership  arrangements  with  local  industry  and \npotential  employers;  (iv)  plans  for  utilization  of  training  workshops  and  new  equipment;  and \n(v) availability of adequate funding for consumables and O&M costs. Based on the results of labor \nmarket  research  and  employment  forecasts,  MLSP  will  undertake  its  own  analysis  and  make \nproposals  to  optimize  facilities  and  equipment,  ensure  that  training  programs  will  meet  current \nand future demands, and guarantee that students from poor families will benefit.  \n \n42.  Within 2 months of grant effectiveness, MLSP will establish a selection committee that will \nreview  proposals  received  from  schools  and  select  schools  for  inclusion  in  the  Project.  The \ncommittee  will  consist  of  five  members,  including  one  representative  each  from  DVTE,  MLSP, \nChamber  of  Industry  and  Commerce,  civil  society,  and  development  partners.  The  key  criterion \nfor the selection of schools will be the potential impact of the training courses on the employability \nand  income  earning  opportunities  of  students.  The  final  selection  of  schools,  scope  of \nrehabilitation  works,  and  equipment  packages  will  be  submitted  by  MLSP  to  ADB  for \nconcurrence.  National  and  international  consultants  will  provide  support  in  identifying  adequate \ntraining  equipment  and  prepare  technical  specifications  for  the  tenders.  To  support  the \npreparation of tender documents for rehabilitation works and supervise all civil works, the Project \nwill provide budget to engage an engineering consulting firm. \n \n43.  Mobile training workshops will be provided to serve schools not covered under the Project, \nparticularly schools in remote villages, and will be based in and managed by a complex school to \nbe  chosen  by  the  selection  committee.  The  mobile  training  workshop  will  be  equipped  with \ntraining  equipment  for  priority  basic  skills  areas  that  will  be  identified  during  the  first  year  of \nproject implementation. Further administrative  arrangements for operation of the  mobile training \nworkshops will be agreed by the selection committee. \n \n\n3. \n\nComponent 3:  Modernizing the Curriculum and Learning Assessment and \nDeveloping Learning Materials \n\n \nThe  Project  will  help  develop  a  competency-based  and  modularized  curriculum15  with \n44. \nrelated skills and education standards. Curriculum modules will be refocused on the demand of \n                                                 \n15 A competency-based training system will emphasize on students\u2019 abilities to perform tasks at a specified proficiency \nlevel according to industry standards, and provide a wide range of opportunities for students to practice and acquire \nskills and knowledge to become competent skilled workers. \n\n\fthe formal and informal labor market. The new curriculum will foster a student-centered learning \napproach  and  ensure  that  practical  training  is  embedded  into  training  programs.  The  revised \ncurriculum  will  aim  at  producing  multiskilled  graduates.  Curriculum  modules  will  incorporate \nentrepreneurial principles to prepare students for self-employment and jobs in the informal sector. \nThere are three interrelated activities under this component: (i) revision of the current curriculum, \n(ii)  development  and  production  of  teaching  and  learning  materials,  and  (iii) development  of \nassessment guides. \n \n45. \nCurriculum Modernization. The Project will provide resources to upgrade the capacity of \nDVTE to manage the process of curriculum revision. The Project will assist in establishing expert \ngroups consisting of curriculum developers, selected school instructors, and subject experts from \nthe  private  sector.  The  expert  groups  will  assess  current  skill  standards  and  revise  curriculum \nmodules in the following vocational areas: (i) agriculture,16 (ii) construction, (iii) basic IT services, \n(iv)  automotive,  (v)  carpentry,  (vi)  electrical,  (vii)  metalwork,  (viii)  garments,  and  (ix)  hospitality. \nThe  new  curriculum  will  integrate  entrepreneurship  development  in  all  vocational  areas  to  train \nstudents to understand the principles and practices of entrepreneurship. The Project will support \non-the-job  and  apprentice  schemes  as  integral  parts  of  the  curriculum  to  enable  students  to \nacquire  relevant  skills,  knowledge,  work  discipline,  and  real  work  experience.  The  Project  will \nprovide  training  to  instructors  to  prepare  lessons  and  instructional  material  according  to  the \nrevised curriculum and implement competency-based curriculum modules. \n \n46.  Material Development. The development of teaching and learning materials will follow a \ndecentralized approach. Selected complex schools with strengths in particular training areas will \nbe nominated as centers for material development in their area of specialization. The Project will \nprovide an equipment package for each of the nominated complex schools. Based on the revised \ncurriculum  and  supported  by  consultants  and  graphic  designers,  expert  groups\u2014consisting  of \ninstructors, specialists from the private sector, and curriculum developers\u2014will prepare learning \nmaterials. Once the preparation of specific course materials has been completed, it will be made \navailable through the internet for downloading and printing at each school. Additional printing and \ndistribution  of  materials  will  be  arranged  through  tendering.  All  tenders  will  comply  with  ADB \nProcurement Guidelines (April 2006, as amended from time to time) as the basis for procurement. \n \nLearning  Assessment.  Currently,  there  is  no  agreed  national  examination  system  in \n47. \nplace.  The  Project  will  provide  assistance  to  introduce  a  uniformed  assessment  system  with \nemphasis  on  skills  tests  and  practical  examinations,  in  addition  to  theoretical  exams. \nExaminations  will  be  prepared  and  conducted  by  instructors  and  subject  specialists  from  the \nprivate  sector.  The  Project  will  provide  support  to  assist  school  management,  teachers,  and \ninstructors  to  improve  (i)  the  quality  of  theoretical  assessments;  and  (ii)  the  preparation  of  skill \ntests and practical examinations, which will include developing an examination items data bank. \n \n\n4. \n\nComponent 4:  Human Resource Development \n\n \n48. \nComponent  4 will consolidate training needs which arise in the process of reforming the \nPVE system. Based on a comprehensive human resources development plan and related training \nneeds  assessments,  training  activities  will  include  (i)  DVTE  staff,  (ii)  school  management, \n(iii) schools  instructors  and  teachers,  and  (iv)  a  specialist  for  curriculum  and  training  material \ndevelopment. \n \n\n                                                 \n16 HELVETAS has developed high quality curriculum and teaching/learning materials, which are used in pilot schools, \nfor  the  agriculture  sector.  The  Project  will  integrate  lessons  from  HELVETAS  in  the  curriculum  and  material \ndevelopment process to roll out successful materials nationwide. \n\n11 \n\n \n\n\f12 \n\n49. \nStrengthen  Professional  Development  for  Instructors.  The  Project  will  assist  in \nestablishing an in-service training system which will provide continuous training opportunities for \ninstructors,  with  focus  on  student-centered  teaching  approaches  and  practical  training  for \nstudents.  International  and  national  consultants  will  train  and  supervise  a  group  of  60  core \ntrainers who will, in turn, conduct training programs for instructors to improve teaching methods \nand  assessment  techniques.  Special  emphasis  will  be  given  to  entrepreneurial  approaches  in \nteaching.  Core  trainers  will  be  given  3  weeks  of  training  and  equipped  with  manuals.  Training \nprograms will be conducted at complex schools and will include all instructors currently in service. \nDVTE will assign a team to plan, organize, and follow up on training programs with the support of \nthe project implementation unit (PIU). \n \n50. \nStrengthen Management Capacities. To promote an entrepreneurial culture in schools, \nthe  Project  will  provide  training  for  school  management  and  selected  DVTE  staff  on  assets \nmanagement, financial management, basic IT skills, development of business plans, and human \nresources development planning. Financed by the Project, training will be conducted by national \nand international consultants and private training providers. The Project will establish a system to \nprovide  regular  management  support  and  follow-up  training  measures  for  school  principals  and \nadministrators. DVTE will identify suitable national training providers and develop criteria to select \ntrainees. \n \n51. \nCurriculum  and  Material  Development  and  Assessment  Methods.  Supported  by \ninternational and national consultants, capacity will be built throughout the PVE system to ensure \nregular update of training modules and continued provision of learning materials. Selected groups \nof  skill  specialists  will  receive  on-the-job  training  in  curriculum  design  and  development  of \nmaterials. Training programs will be conducted at schools to introduce new assessment methods. \nIn  addition  to  in-service  training  conducted  by  core  trainers  and  private  training  providers,  the \nProject will provide support to establish a training platform based on ICT, which will offer updated \ninformation on education content, modern pedagogy, and reference and learning materials. The \nIT capacity of complex schools will be strengthened to provide additional options for teachers and \ninstructors to engage in interactive self-learning.  \n\n \nSpecial Features \n\nC. \n \nThe  Project  has  two  key  strategies  to  address  the  mismatch  in  the  labor  market: \n52. \n(i) creating  flexible  mechanisms  with  active  industry  participation  to  adapt  training  programs  to \nnew business circumstances regularly, and (ii) preparing flexible graduates who are able to adjust \nto changing demands in the labor market quickly.  \n \nTo adjust training programs to changing demands of the formal and informal labor market \n53. \nin  a  timely  manner,  the  Project  will  support  MLSP  in  strengthening  labor  market  research  and \nemployment  forecasts  and  involve  private  sector  participation  at  all  levels.  At  the  national  level, \nlabor market research results and training programs will be regularly reviewed by the Chamber of \nIndustry  and  Commerce,  civil  society  organizations,  and  selected  business  associations.  At  the \nschool  level,  advisory  boards  will  be  established,  comprising  local  employers  and  NGOs,  to \nprovide  guidance  on  the  local  skill  demand  and  review  school  training  programs.  Industry  and \nNGOs  will  participate  in  the  project  steering  committee  (PSC)  and  be  involved  in  the  selection \ncommittee to identify schools to be included in the Project. Skill specialists from companies will \nparticipate  in  curriculum  development,  learning  material  design,  and  learning  assessments; \ncompanies will provide opportunities for on-the-job training and apprentices schemes. \n \nThe combined effects of restructuring and rationalizing the current PVE, and applying an \n54. \nentrepreneurial management approach, will ensure cost-effective improvements within the current \nbudget  allocation.  Adopting  an  entrepreneurial  approach  to  managing  schools  and  program \nthe  principles  of \nfor  students \ndelivery  will  create  an  environment \n\nthat  demonstrates \n\n\fentrepreneurship.  Graduates  who  will  seek  jobs  in  the  informal  sector  or  as  self-employed  will \nbenefit from a learning environment that practices and teaches entrepreneurship. Becoming more \nentrepreneurial  will  enable  schools  to  increase  income  generation  and  reduce  dependency  on \npublic allocations.  \n \nIn broadening the scope of the PVE system\u2014by introducing short-term skills courses\u2014the \n55. \nProject  will  contribute  to  provide  training  and  retraining  opportunities  for  numerous  youth  who \nhave  left  school  without  marketable  skills,  and  unemployed  and  underemployed  adults  who  are \nseeking job opportunities. Active industry participation in the design of short courses will ensure \nthat training programs are demand-driven, and will improve the employability of trainees.  \n \nD. \n\nProject Investment Plan \n \nThe total project cost is estimated at $13.0 million equivalent. Project cost estimates by \n\n56. \nexpense category are in Table 1.

The remaining $3.0 million, or 23% of the total \nproject cost, will be provided by the Government. The financing plan is in Table 2. \n\nFinancing Plan  \n\n \nTable 2: Financing Plan \n($ \u2018000) \n\nSource \nAsian Development Bank \nGovernment  \nTotal \nNote:  Government  financing  is  included  in  the  budget  and  consists  of  taxes  and  duties;  contributions  of \nmanagers,  teachers,  instructors,  and  administrators  within  the  PVE  system;  provision  of  workshop  and  office \nfacilities; and contingencies. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n                      Total \n10,000 \n3,000 \n13,000 \n\n                                     Percent \n\n77 \n23 \n100 \n\n13 \n\n \n\n\f14 \n\n \nTo  further  support  project  activities,  Germany  (GTZ)  has  indicated  that  it  will  provide \n58. \nadditional  consulting  inputs  on  a  grant  basis  in  the  areas  of  development  of  a  VESD  policy \nframework,  entrepreneurial  training,  curriculum  revision,  and  development  of  short-term  skills \ntraining courses for adults. HELVETAS has indicated that it will provide consultancy inputs on a \ngrant  basis  to  strengthen  school  management  and  promote  material  development  and  teacher \ntraining related to agriculture. \n \n59. \nGrant  Financing.  The  Kyrgyz  Republic  is  one  of  the  poorest  countries  in  Asia,  facing \nserious debt stress. The Project is closely aligned with ADB\u2019s poverty reduction strategy and the \nGovernment\u2019s  country  development  strategy  (\u0421DS).  The  CDS  overall  objectives  include \nimprovement of living standards by achieving sustainable economic growth, creation of conditions \nfor  full  employment,  providing  high  and  stable  incomes,  and  availability  of  a  wide  spectrum  of \nsocial services. Since more than 50% of students enrolled in PVE schools are from low-income \nfamilies,  and  the  vast  majority  of  adults  participating  in  training  and  retraining  programs  are \nexpected  to  be  unemployed  or  underemployed,  the  Project  will  contribute  directly  to  poverty \nreduction through increasing income generation opportunities. While public funding is expected to \nbe sufficient to cover recurrent expenditure of the PVE system, it is unlikely that the Government \nwill be able to finance the urgently needed rehabilitation and modernization of PVE facilities from \nits own resources. Given the high level of capital investment needs, grant financing of the Project \nwill ease the costs of external financing.  \n \nF. \n \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n1. \n\nProject Management \n\n \n60. \nThe Executing Agency (EA) of the Project will be MLSP. The EA will appoint the project \ndirector  who  will  coordinate  the  overall  implementation  of  project  activities.  A  PSC  will  be \nestablished to provide strategic guidance and monitor the implementation of the Project. The PSC \nwill be chaired by the Vice Prime Minister of the Kyrgyz Republic and consist representatives of \nMLSP, Ministry of Economy and Finance, Office of the Prime Minister, Chamber of Industry and \nCommerce, Confederation of Employers, and the Civil Association Forum of Education Initiatives. \nOP  will  identify  one  industry  and  one  NGO  representative.  The  PSC  will  meet  quarterly,  or  as \noften as required. GTZ and HELVETAS will participate as observers in the PSC. \n \n61. \nThe  Project  will  be  implemented  through  a  PIU,  staffed  by  a  project  manager,  a \nprocurement  specialist,  a  finance  specialist,  a  monitoring  and  evaluation  (M&E)  specialist,  an \nadministrative  assistant,  an  accountant,  and  part-time  interpreters.  The  project  manager  will  be \nresponsible  for  the  overall  implementation  of  project  activities.  Office  space  for  the  PIU  will  be \nprovided within DVTE. The PIU will report to the project director and provide quarterly progress \nreports to the PSC, EA, and ADB.  \n \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Period \n\nThe Project will be implemented over 4 years from March 2007 to March 2011.  \n\n \n62. \n \n\n3. \n\nProcurement \n\n \n63. \nAll ADB-financed civil works, goods, and related services will be procured in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (April 2006, as amended from time to time). Civil works will \ninvolve rehabilitation of existing facilities, but there will be no construction of new facilities. Civil \nwork contracts will be less than $1.0 million. National contractors are capable of carrying out all \nrehabilitation works, so civil work contracts estimated to cost $1.0 million or less will be procured \n\n\f(NCB)  procedures  acceptable \n\nto  ADB.  Before \nthrough  national  competitive  bidding \ncommencement  of  NCB  procurement,  ADB  and  the  recipient  will  review  the  recipient\u2019s \nprocurement  procedures  to  ensure  consistency  with  ADB  requirements.  Any  necessary \nmodifications or clarifications to the recipient\u2019s procurement procedures will be documented in the \nprocurement plan. \n \n64. \nThe  Project  will  provide  training  equipment,  computer  and  related  ICT  equipment, \nteaching  aids,  classroom  furniture,  learning  materials,  and  manuals.  Equipment  and  goods \nestimated  to  cost  more  than  $500,000  will  be  procured  under  international  competitive  bidding \nprocedures. Equipment and materials estimated to cost $500,000 or less will be procured under \nNCB  procedures  acceptable  to  ADB.  Learning  materials  and  other  equipment  and  materials \nvalued  at  $100,000  or  less  will  be  procured  by  shopping.  Before  the  commencement  of  any \nprocurement  activity  under  NCB  procedures,  ADB  and  the  Government  will  review  the  public \nprocurement  law  to  ensure  consistency  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines.  Any  necessary \nmodifications  or  clarifications  will  be  reflected  in  the  procurement  plan.  The  Government  has \nprepared  a  procurement  plan  for  the  initial  18  months  (Appendix  7).  The  procurement  plan \nincludes  (i)  particular  contracts  for  the  goods,  works,  and  related  services  required  to  carry  out \nthe  Project,  (ii)  proposed  methods  for  procuring  contracts  that  are  permitted  under  the  grant \nagreement,  and  (iii)  related  ADB  review  procedures.  The  Government  will  update  the \nprocurement plan annually or as needed throughout project implementation. \n \n\n4. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n \n65. \nAll consulting services will be recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants  (April  2006,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  Under  the  four  project  components,  a \ntotal of 35 person-months of international and 107 person-months of national consulting services \nwill  be  contracted,  financed  by  ADB  funds.  International  and  national  consultants  financed  from \nADB funds will be recruited as a firm under quality and cost-based selection methods, using full \ntechnical  proposals.  In  addition  to  consultants  contracted  through  a  firm,  the  Government  has \nrequested  advance  recruitment  of  one  individual  international  organizational  development \nspecialist  and  one  individual  national  legal  specialist.  The  Government  has  agreed  to  recruit \nindividual  national  consultants  for  the  PIU  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  procedures  for  recruiting \nindividual consultants. Consulting services under the four components will include experts in the \nfield of (i) organizational development, (ii) legal advice, (iii) management information system, (iv) \ncareer  guidance,  (v) equipment  selection  and  procurement,  (vi)  curriculum  and  training  material \ndevelopment, (vii) graphic design, (viii) teacher training, and (ix) entrepreneurship. In addition, the \nProject provides budget for engaging (i) an engineering consulting firm, (ii) an IT consulting firm, \nand (iii) national training providers. The outline terms of reference and a personnel schedule for \nthe project consultants are in Appendix 8. \n \n\n5.  \n\nAnticorruption Measures \n\n \n66. \nADB\u2019s  policy  on  Anticorruption  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was  explained  to  and \ndiscussed  with  government  officials.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance, \naccountability,  and  transparency,  ADB  reserves  the  right  to  investigate,  directly  or  through  its \nagents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive or coercive practices relating to the Project. To \nsupport  these  efforts,  relevant  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s  policy  on  Anticorruption  are  included  in  the \ngrant regulations and the bidding documents for the Project. In particular, all contracts financed \nby ADB in connection with the Project shall include provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit \nand examine the records and accounts of the EA and all contractors, suppliers, consultants, and \nother service providers as they relate to the Project. \n \n\n15 \n\n \n\n\f16 \n\n6. \n\nCapacity Building, Staff Development, and Training \n\n \n67. \nThe Project will provide in-country training to upgrade the skills and knowledge of selected \nstaff  from  the  EA,  school  managers  and  administrators,  instructors,  and  teachers.  The  EA  will \nprepare the selection criteria for training candidates for ADB approval. The PIU will provide ADB \nwith (i) a list of nominated candidates, (ii) proposed training institutions, and (iii) detailed costing \nof the proposed training programs. Training measures to upgrade the capacities of instructors will \nbe conducted by international and national consultants and a group of core trainers. The Project \nwill  finance  national  and  international  consultants  to  design  and  conduct  training  programs. \nFacilities of complex schools will be used to conduct in-service training programs. In addition, the \nProject  will  finance  (i)  a  national  engineering  consulting  firm  to  support  in  preparing  tender \ndocuments  for  rehabilitation  and  repair  works,  and  supervise  all  civil  works;  (ii)  national  private \ntraining  providers  to  conduct  management  training;  and  (iii)  a  national  IT  consulting  firm  to \nsupport the establishment of computerized management information systems, including adequate \ntraining of staff to operate these systems. \n \n7. \n \n68. \nThe  proposed  grant  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement \nHandbook (2001). An imprest account will be established to expedite disbursement of the project \nfunds.  The  PIU  will  open  the  account  in  a  commercial  bank  selected  by  the  Government, \nacceptable  to  ADB.  The  ceiling  of  the  imprest  account  will  not  exceed  estimated  ADB-financed \nexpenditures for 6 months, or 10% of the grant amount, whichever is lower. The initial amount to \nbe deposited in the imprest account will not exceed $500,000. \n \nStatement  of  expenditure  procedures  will  be  used  to  reimburse  eligible  expenditures \n69. \nunder  ADB-financed  activities  and  liquidate  advances  provided  to  the  imprest  account,  in \naccordance with  procedures  satisfactory  to  ADB  and  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan Disbursement \nHandbook.  Each  individual  payment  reimbursed  or  liquidated  under  the  procedures  will  not \nexceed $100,000 equivalent for each item of expenditure. \n \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n8. \n\nAdvance Contracting and Retroactive Financing \n\n \nThe  Government  has  requested  advance  contracting  and  retroactive  financing  for  (i)  the \n70. \nrecruitment  of  PIU  staff,  including  a  project  manager,  financial  specialist,  M&E  specialist,  and \noffice  assistant;  (ii)  the  recruitment  of  two  consultants  to  support  the  preparation  of  the \nconsolidation  strategy;  and  (iii)  the  procurement  of  PIU  office  equipment  and  a  vehicle.  The \nadvance  contracting  will  be  undertaken  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  and \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants. Retroactive financing will apply to such expenses incurred \nafter  1  December  2006  until  the  date  the  grant  becomes  effective  and  for  an  amount  not \nexceeding  $100,000.  The  Government  was  advised  that  ADB  Management\u2019s  approval  of \nadvanced contracting will not commit ADB to subsequently approve the project or to finance the \nprocurement costs, and retroactive financing approved by Management \u201cin principle\u201d is subject to \napproval by the Board, and as such does not commit ADB to financing the Project. \n \n\n9. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n \n71. \nThe EA will maintain the project accounts and prepare financial statements according to \ninternational  accounting  standards.  The  EA  will  have  the  project  accounts  and  related  financial \nstatements audited annually by independent auditors acceptable to ADB. Certified copies of the \naudited project accounts and audited financial statements (including the auditor\u2019s opinion on the \nuse  of  grant  proceeds,  compliance  with  covenants,  and  the  use  of  the  imprest  account  under \n\n\fADB\u2019s  statement  of  expenditure  procedures)  will  be  submitted  to  ADB  in  English  not  later  than \n6 months after the end of each financial year. \n \n72. \nThe  PIU  will  prepare  quarterly  reports  on  project  implementation  to  be  approved  by  the \nPSC  and  submit  them  to  ADB  within  30  days  after  each  quarter.  Reports  will  be  in  a  form \nacceptable  to  ADB  and  will  indicate,  among  other  matters,  progress  made  against  established \ntargets, problems and constraints encountered during the last quarter, steps taken and proposed \nto  be  taken  to  resolve  problems,  compliance  with  covenants,  and  the  proposed  program  of \nactivities for the succeeding quarter. Within 3 months after completion of the Project, the PIU will \nsubmit  a  project  completion  report  to  ADB  providing  details  about  project  implementation, \naccomplishments, costs, impacts, and other information requested by ADB. \n \n\n10. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n \n73.  Within  the  first  month  of  implementation,  the  PIU  will  prepare  a  project  performance \nmanagement  system  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  project  performance  management  system.  In \naddition to the performance targets and indicators specified in the project design and monitoring \nframework (Appendix 1), the Project will develop a monitoring mechanism to (i) evaluate project \nimpacts  on  the  participation  of  disabled  students  and  students  from  poor  families,  (ii) assess \nwhether new equipment is fully integrated in curriculum and lesson plans and utilized by students \nfor practical training, and (iii) review whether managers and instructors trained under the Project \napply  their  new  knowledge  and  skills.  Monitoring  results  will  be  used  to  adjust  the  annual \nimplementation plans.17 A regular tracer system will be established to monitor whether graduates \nfrom PVS have found employment or started their own income-earning activities. Feedback from \nemployers  and  parents  will  be  collected  to  monitor  and  adjust  training  programs  and \nimplementation  schedules  regularly,  if  necessary.  Rehabilitation  works  will  be  monitored  by  the \nEA and reports will be submitted to the PSC and ADB on an annual basis. \n \n\n11. \n\nProject Review \n\n \n74. \nADB  and  the  Government  will  jointly  undertake  semiannual  reviews  of  the  Project.  The \nreviews will assess progress in each component, identify issues and constraints, and determine \nnecessary remedial action and adjustments. A midterm review will be conducted at the end of the \nsecond  year  of  implementation.  The  midterm  review  will  (i)  review  the  scope,  design,  and \nimplementation  arrangements;  and  identify  adjustments  required;  (ii)  assess  progress  of  the \nproject  implementation  against  performance  indicators;  and  (iii)  recommend  changes  in  the \ndesign or implementation arrangements, if necessary. \n \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\n \n75. \nProject  Benefits  and  Impacts.  The  Government  has  launched  a  number  of  reforms  to \nimprove the business climate and create a supportive enabling framework for the private sector. \nTransforming  the  current  PVE  system\u2014from  one  that  is  supply-driven  and  inefficient  to  one \nattuned  to  labor  market  needs  capable  of  producing  better  equipped  and  skilled  workers,  and \nproviding \nfor  out-of-school  youth  and  adults\u2014will \ncomplement the Government\u2019s strategic thrust to promote private sector growth. \n \n76. \nThe  close  link  between  educational  development  and  reduction  in  the  incidence  of \npoverty, improvement of productivity, economic growth, and improving general living conditions is \n\ntraining  and  retraining  opportunities \n\n                                                 \n17 During the appraisal mission, a draft plan of operation to prepare for consolidation of the PVE system was approved \nfor the first  year of implementation (Supplementary Appendix B). For each  year of project implementation, the PIU \nwill prepare a detailed implementation plan to be approved by the PSC and submitted to ADB. \n\n17 \n\n \n\n\f18 \n\nwell  established.  About  24,000  students  will  benefit  from  the  reform  of  the  PVE  system.  New \ndemand-driven curriculum modules, rehabilitated and upgraded training workshops, and practice-\noriented training programs, will improve their employment and income-earning opportunities after \ngraduation. In addition, at the end of the project duration, it is assumed that at least 6,000 adults \nand  out-of-school  youth  will  benefit  annually  from  relevant  short-term  skills  training  courses \nconducted by PVE schools. Considering that more than 50% of youth and adults participating in \ntraining programs belong to low-income families, the Project will contribute to enhancing income \nopportunities of the poor. About 1,300 instructors, 500 teachers, and 200 school managers and \nadministrators  will  benefit  from  in-service  training  programs.  Companies  will  benefit  from \nimprovements in the relevance and quality of training programs that will result in better prepared \nskilled workers and contribute to higher productivity. \n \n77. \nTo improve gender responsiveness, the Project will develop strategies to address gender \nstereotypes  in  curriculum  and  material  development.  The  Project  was  designed  through  a \nparticipatory process involving key government stakeholders, business associations, companies, \nand  civil  society  groups.  During  implementation,  the  Project  will  maintain  broad  stakeholder \nparticipation in its activities. \n \n78. \nSustainability. The Government\u2019s contribution to the Project is included in the budget and \nestimated at $3.0 million, which will be from 0.4% to 0.5% of the total expenditure on education. It \ncan  be  assumed  that  the  project  activities  are  sustainable,  taking  into  account  (i) anticipated \nincreased  proceeds  through  income  generation  activities  from  schools,  which  are  expected  to \ndouble  within  the  Project\u2019s  duration;  and  (ii)  cost-effective  improvements  of  the  PVE  system \nthrough  consolidation  and  rationalization.  The  Government  is  strongly  committed  to  reform  the \nPVE  system.  The  Mid  Term  Budget  Framework  2006\u20132008  indicates  that  PVE  funding  will \nincrease during 2006\u20132008. The major share of increases in PVE funding is committed to raise \nteachers\u2019 salaries and increase daily allowances for school food, which will improve the working \nand learning environment in PVSs.  \n \n79. \nAn  examination  was  made  to  assess  whether  there  will  be  sufficient  funds  available  to \ncover  expenditures  of  a  consolidated  system  including  costs  for  utilities,  O&M  and  purchase  of \nconsumables  to  operate  training  workshops.  Details  are  provided  in  Appendix  4.  It  can  be \nassumed that from 2010 onwards\u2014when the consolidation and rationalization measures and the \nintroduction  of  an  entrepreneurial  culture  at  school  level  will  show  impacts\u2014sufficient  funds  will \nbe available to cover training measures and operate and maintain training workshops and other \nfacilities. However, the examination indicates that funds required for further capital investments to \nrehabilitate  and  equip  all  schools  within  the  system  will  not  be  sufficient.  The  Government  will \ndepend  on  external  assistance  to  meet  future  challenges  in  rehabilitating  and  upgrading  all \nschools in the PVE system. \n \nEnvironmental  and  Social  Safeguards.  The  Project  will  carry  out  minor  rehabilitation \n80. \nand  repairs  of  existing  school  buildings  and  facilities;  there  will  be  no  land  acquisition  required, \nand  no  negative  environmental  or  resettlement  impact.  Some  school  rehabilitation  works  will \ninclude  improved  water  supply  and  sanitation  and  sewage  systems,  which  will  promote  good \nhealth and have a positive environmental impact. There are no issues of ethnic minority language \nof instruction, so ADB\u2019s Policy on Indigenous Peoples (1998) is not applicable. \n \n81. \nAssumptions.  Successful  implementation  of  the  Project  assumes  that  the  Government \nwill (i) increase the budget allocation for PVE as indicated, (ii) be committed to consolidate and \nmodernize  the  PVE  system,  and  (iii)  provide  adequate  budget  to  finance  in-service  training  as \nplanned.  To  achieve  its  impact,  the  Project  assumes  that  further  steady  economic  growth  will \ncreate new job opportunities. \n\n\f \nRisks. At present, MLSP\u2019s managerial and technical capacity is limited, and might affect \n82. \nthe  smooth  implementation  of  reforming  the  PVE  system.  This  risk  will  be  mitigated  through \ntraining  and  capacity  building  under  the  Project.  The  impact  of  consolidating  schools  and \nintroducing  a  new  entrepreneurship  approach  will  be  significant.  Risks  include  resistance  from \nteachers  and  school  directors  to  accept  changes.  The  risks  will  be  mitigated  by  adopting  a \nparticipatory  and  transparent  approach  to  project  implementation\u2014actively  involving  school \ndirectors, instructors, teachers, and employers.  \n \nFinancial risks involve potential difficulties in the provision of recurrent costs for O&M and \n83. \nfunds  for  consumables.  During  project  implementation,  the  Project  will  mitigate  the  risk  by \nproviding a lump sum to rehabilitated workshops to support the first year of operation. In addition, \nthe  Project\u2019s  strategy  aims  at  reducing  the  dependency  on  public  allocations  by  promoting  an \nentrepreneurial approach and strengthening income generation at PVS level.  \n \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nIn addition to the standard assurances stipulated in the Grant Agreement, the Government \n\n \n84. \nhas given the following assurances, which will be incorporated in the legal documents. \n \n85. \nCounterpart  Funding.  Throughout  project  implementation,  the  Government  will  allocate \nand  release  in  a  timely  manner  adequate  budget  funding  for  (i)  the  costs  in  support  of  training \nprograms; and (ii) incremental recurrent costs of O&M of all selected schools under the Project.  \n \n86. \nThe Government will also allocate and release in a timely manner adequate budget and \nprovide sufficient and qualified staff to the Research and Methodology Department so that it will \nbe  able  to  regularly  review  and  update  curriculum  and  ensure  that  training  programs  are \nrefocused  on  the  needs  of  the  formal  and  informal  labor  market.  Throughout  project \nimplementation,  the  Government  will  provide  ADB  with  information  on  allocations  and  actual \nexpenditures for PVE system through submission of annual reports, in a form acceptable to ADB.   \n \n87. \nConsolidation  Strategy.  The  Government  will  approve  a  consolidation  strategy  for  the \nPVE  system,  satisfactory  to  ADB  not  later  than  6  months  after  grant  effectiveness  and  will \nimplement  measures  identified  in  the  strategy  within  3  years  after  grant  effectiveness.  The \nGovernment will ensure that the amount of annual budget allocation for PVE system throughout \nproject implementation will be increased to cover the O&M costs.  \n \nThe Government will ensure that, by no later than 12 months after the grant effectiveness, \n88. \nthe  legal  environment  is  established  to  enable  (i)  the  EA  to  manage,  sell,  and  rent  out  current \nassets  and  reallocate  staff  of  schools;  and  (ii)  PVS  to  keep  revenues  earned  through  training \ncourses and marketing of services and goods. \n \n89. \nSchools  Selection  Process.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  only  schools  selected \nthrough a competitive process will be eligible for rehabilitation and provision of equipment under \nthe  Project.  Selection  will  be  based  on  the  assessment  of  business  plans  prepared  by  schools \nproviding information on (i) planned training courses for skills in demand and number of potential \nparticipants,  (ii)  availability  of  qualified  teachers  and  instructors,  (iii)  partnership  arrangements \nwith  local  industries,  (iv)  plans  for  utilization  of  new  equipment,  and  (v)  availability  of  adequate \nfunding  for  consumables  and  O&M  costs.  The  EA  will  establish,  within  2  months  of  grant \neffectiveness, a selection committee that will review proposals and select schools. The committee \nwill  consist  of  five  members,  including  one  representative  each  from  DVTE,  from  MLSP, \nemployers, civil society, and development partners. The key criterion for the selection of schools \n\n19 \n\n \n\n\f20 \n\nwill  be  the  impact  of  the  training  courses  on  employability  and  income  earning  opportunities  of \nparticipants. \n  \n90. \nThe Government will ensure that all rehabilitation works under the Project are undertaken \nwithin the existing school facilities, which will not require any land acquisition. All project facilities \nwill be operated and maintained in accordance with government environmental and safety rules \nand regulations. \n \n91. \nProject  Performance  Management  System.  The  Government  will  ensure  that,  within \n3 months  of  the  grant  effectiveness,  the  PIU  establishes  the  project  performance  management \nsystem to monitor progress of project implementation and evaluate project impacts based on the \nkey baseline indicators agreed between the EA and ADB. \n \nTransparency  and  Anticorruption.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  (i)  relevant \n92. \nprovisions  of  ADB\u2019s  policy  on  Anticorruption  are  included  in  all  bidding  documents;  (ii)  all \ncontracts financed by ADB in connection with the Project include provisions specifying the right of \nADB  to  audit  and  examine  the  records  and  accounts  of  the  EA  and  all  contractors,  suppliers, \nconsultants,  and  other  service  providers  as  they  relate  to  the  Project;  and  (iii)  an  audit  of \nprocurement activities is carried out at least twice during the project implementation. The cost of \nthe audit will be financed by the Project provided that the auditor is selected though a competitive \nprocess and has qualifications and terms of reference acceptable to ADB.  \n \n93. \nThe  Government  will  establish,  within  6  months  from  grant  effectiveness,  a  website  that \nwill  present  information  on  the  project  progress,  including  information  on,  among  other  things, \nschools  selected  under  the  Project,  current  training  programs  of  the  PVE  system,  procurement \nactivities, including the list of participating bidders, names of the winning bidders, basic details on \nthe  adopted  bidding  procedures,  amounts  of  the  contracts  awarded,  the  list  of  goods  and/or \nservices purchased, and their intended and actual utilization. \n \nConditions  for  Contract  Awards.  Prior  to  award  of  any  contract  for  civil  works  and \n94. \nprovision  of  equipment,  the  Government  will  present  to  ADB  documents  confirming  that  (i)  a \nconsolidation strategy for the PVE system has been approved, (ii) all schools selected under the \nconsolidation  process  are  duly  registered  by  the  respective  registration  authority,  and  (iii) \nsufficient budgetary resources for O&M costs of those schools for the next year are allocated. \n \n95. \nEffectiveness  Conditions.  Prior  to  grant  effectiveness,  the  Government  will  establish \nand  make  operational  the  PIU  within  DVTE  in  a  manner  satisfactory  to  ADB,  including  the \nappointment of the project director, acceptable to ADB. \n \n\nVI. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n \n96. \nI am satisfied that the proposed grant would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve the grant not exceeding \nthe amount of $10,000,000 to the Kyrgyz Republic, from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources for the \nVocational  Education  and  Skills  Development  Project,  upon  terms  and  conditions  as  are \nsubstantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  draft  Grant  Agreement  presented  to  the \nBoard.  \n \n \n\n3 January 2007 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n\n\fDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n\n \nDesign \nSummary \n\nImpact \n \n\u2022  Employability and \nincome earning \nopportunities of \ngraduates from primary \nvocational schools \nimproved \n\n\u2022  Private sector led \neconomic growth \nstrengthened through \navailability of \nmultiskilled labor \n\n \n\nOutcome \n \nEnhanced equitable \naccess to and improved \nquality and relevance of \nprimary vocational \neducation and short term \nskills training \n\nOutputs \n \n1.

MOE  also \nadministers  curriculum  development  and  teacher  training  for  general  education,  directs  state \nexamination procedures, and is responsible for the accreditation of higher education institutions. \nThe  current  structure  of  the  education  system  is  described  in  Table  A2.1.  The  Law  on \nEducation,  the  Education  Development  Concept  until  2010,  and  the  National  Action  Plan  on \nEducation  for  All  (EFA)  define  the  framework  for  the  Government\u2019s  education  policy.  The \nNational  Action  Plan  on  EFA  aims  at  universal  enrollment  in  general  education  and  highlights \nthe  importance  of  primary  vocational  education  and  the  development  of  an  adult  education \nsystem. \n \n\nEducation Stage \n\nAge \n\nInstitutions \n\nTable A2.1:  Structure of the Education System \n \n\nGrade \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\n1\u2013 9 \n\n7\u201315 \n\n10\u201311 \n\n16\u201318 \n\n17\u201318 \n\n17\u201324 \n\n2,045 general education schools \n\n116 gymnasiums/lyceums \n112 primary vocational education  \ninstitutions \n\n \n        >23 \n \n\nPrimary Vocational \nEducation  \n\n \n \n \n49 universities and other higher \neducation institutions \n \n22 secondary vocational \neducation institutions \n\n \nPostgraduate Education \n \nHigher Education \n \n \nSecondary Vocational Education    \n \n \nGeneral \nSecondary \nEducation \n \nGeneral Education  \n \n \nPreschool \n \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nGeneral Education. The education system in the Kyrgyz Republic still follows the Soviet \n2. \nmodel  and  includes  (i)  pre-schooling,  (ii)  11  years  of  general  education  (primary:  grades  1\u20134; \nlower  secondary:  grades  5\u20139;  and  upper  secondary  education:  grades  10\u201311),  (iii)  primary \nvocational  education  (PVE),  (iv)  secondary  vocational  education  (SVE)  and  (iv)  higher \neducation. Primary and lower secondary education is compulsory. The Government is currently \nconsidering extending general education by 1 year to 12 years. The Constitution stipulates free \nbasic education (grades 1\u20139) for all children. In 2003, net enrollment rate was 98.6% in primary \ngrades  and  72.28%  in  upper  secondary  grades.  Enrollment  in  primary  education  was  96.8% \n(97.8% of boys, 95.8% of girls); 92.8% in lower secondary education (92.6% of boys, 93.0% of \ngirls); and 72% in upper secondary education (68% of boys, 76.1% of girls). In the 2005/2006 \nschool  year,  about  1.12  million  students  were  enrolled  in  2,066  general  education  schools,  of \nwhich 351 were urban and 1,694 were rural.

The Kyrgyz  Republic has two separate systems of \n3. \nvocational  education\u2014primary  vocational  education  (PVE),  described  in  Appendix  3,  and \nsecondary  vocational  education  (SVE).  SVE  is  provided  by  various  ministries  and  agencies, \nincluding private training providers, which offer programs at the post-school level but below the \nlevel of higher education. SVE institutions do not represent a \u201csystem\u201d in the same way as the \nother  education  subsectors.  In  total,  70  institutions18  offer  SVE  programs  and  about  27,000 \nstudents were enrolled in 2005. No tracer studies are available but anecdotal evidence suggests \nthat  a  large  number  of  SVE  graduates  have  difficulties  finding  employment  after  course \ncompletion.  Linkages  are  weak  among  SVE  institutions  and  with  PVE  and  industry.  A \ncomprehensive vocational education and skills development (VESD) policy\u2014linked to a national \nhuman  resources  development  plan,  and  present  and  future  labor  market  needs\u2014is  not  in \nplace.

Higher  education  is  offered  by  49  institutions,  and  the  number  of \nstudents  has  increased  over  the  past  5  years.  However,  academic  quality  has  deteriorated \nsignificantly  because  of  lack  of  connection  between  higher  education  institutions  and  industry; \nand  the  cumulative  effects  of  corruption,  low  faculty  salaries,  an  insufficient  supply  of \nappropriately  qualified  faculty,  shortages  of  learning  materials  and  technology  resources,  and \ninadequate  facilities.  The  proliferation  of  new  and  weak  higher  education  institutions  has \nexacerbated  this  problem.  Increasing  enrollment  in  higher  education  demonstrates  that  many \nyoung people and their parents perceive a university education to be a worthwhile investment. \nHowever, the rising level of enrollment in higher education has important implications in terms of \n\n\fAppendix 2 \n\n27 \n\nthe size of the population and economic structure of the Kyrgyz Republic. The capacity of the \neconomy cannot absorb the increasing number of graduates in jobs that match their academic \nbackgrounds.  Table  A2.4  provides  information  on  enrollment  and  number  of  higher  education \ninstitutions.  Out  of  about  231,000  students  enrolled  in  2005,  about  105,000  were  enrolled  in \ndistance learning programs. \n \n\nTable A2.4: Enrollments and Number of Higher Education Institutions \n2002 \n\n2003 \n\n2000 \n\n2001 \n\n2004 \n\nNumber \n\nInstitutions  \n\n45 \n\n48 \n\n46 \n\n47 \n\n49 \n\nStudents (\u2019000)  \na 34 are public institutions; 17 are private. \nSource: National Statistic Committee (NSC). \n\n188.8 \n\n207.4 \n\n199.1 \n\n203.0 \n\n218.3 \n\n \n5. \nPrivate  Training  Providers.  The  Ministry  of  Education  has  a  system  which  registers \ninstitutions, firms, and individual businesses that provide education and training. However, the \nministry concedes that its registration process does not cover all such institutions and that some \nwould operate outside the registration system. Most of the private providers are located in urban \nareas and offer programs in areas such as driver training, language tuition, short management \ncourses, art and craft, and computer training. Some private training providers are also involved \nin  \u201ccivics\u201d  education  and  other  programs  that  assist  people  to  adjust  to  the  new  economic \nrealities  of  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  and  participate  in  democratic  processes.  However,  the  overall \nquality of the programs was rated poor.  \n\n2005 \n\n49a \n\n231.1 \n\n \n\n\f28 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\nPRIMARY VOCATIONAL EDUCATION \n \n\n1. \nThe primary vocational education (PVE) system was developed under the Soviet era to \nbecome  a  principal  training  network  for  skilled  workers.  It  was  well  linked  with  industry  needs \nand  many  of  the  primary  vocational  schools  (PVSs)  were  located  next  to  large  factories, \nspecialized  in  providing  qualified  workers  for  particular  trades.  At  its  height,  the  PVE  system \nprovided training for up to 90,000 students. However, since 1991, PVE has become one of the \nmost neglected areas of education in the Kyrgyz Republic. The Government reduced its support \nfunds for operation and maintenance (O&M) and reinvestment in training equipment decreased \nsignificantly, buildings deteriorated, and enrollment fell substantially. \n \n2. \nAt  present,  the  PVE  system  is  administered  by  the  Department  for  Vocational  Training \nand Education (DVTE) under the Ministry of Labor and Social Protection (MLSP) and consists of \n112  PVSs.  In  2005,  24,148  students  were  enrolled  in  PVSs;  36%  were  female  students. \nAccording  to  DVTE  data,  about  10,000  students  are  from  low-income  families.  Anecdotal \nevidence and surveys in rural areas suggest that the number of poor students is much higher, \nand that up to 70% of PVE students belong to poor families. Currently, PVSs offer three types of \ncourses:  (i)  three-year  programs  combine  a  vocational  specialty  with  general  education, \nproviding students with the necessary certificate to study further in a higher education institution \n(56% of PVE students are enrolled in the 3-year program); (ii) two-year programs are designed \nfor  students  from  grade  9  and  provide  vocational  education  with  some  general  education,  but \nthis program does not provide the general education components required for higher education; \nand (iii) 10-month courses that strictly target vocational skills, and are marketed to both youth \nand  adults.  In  addition,  some  PVSs  offer  limited  short-term  skills  courses  for  adults,  mainly \nsponsored by the Employment Services. However, in 2005, only about 500 adults were enrolled \nin short courses. \n \n3. \nof course. \n\nNature of PVE courses.

The  staff  composition  of  the  PVE  system  is  inefficient.  Senior  staff  is  too \nthinly  spread  and  the  ratio  of  nonteaching  staff  to  administrative  and  management  staff  is \nunbalanced.  Out  of  about  7,400  staff  engaged  in  PVSs,  only  about  20%  are  skills  instructors \nand 13% are general education teachers; the remaining 67% are managers, administrators, and \nsupport staff (including 332 directors and deputy directors). Only 89 senior skills instructors are \nengaged  in  112  PVSs.  Staff  salaries  are  extremely  low\u2014the  scheduled  salary  for  instructors \nand teachers is Som1,400 ($35) per month, which is well below a living wage. The scheduled \nsalary for a school director is less than Som2,000 ($50) per month, which is very low compared \nwith  a  skilled  trades  wage  of  around  Som6,000  per  month.  Salary  increases  are  vital  for \nimproving the motivation of instructors and teachers and attracting new qualified faculties. The \nGovernment has acknowledged the need to address the low salary level and has indicated that \nit will raise salaries each year over the next 3 years. \n \n6. \nDiscussions  with  PVS  directors  revealed  that  a  wide  variety  of  techniques  are  used  to \nrecruit  staff.  For  example,  retired  trade  workers  supplement  their  incomes  by  passing  on  their \nskills, albeit with little or no pedagogical training. However, they are reported to perform better \nthan  pedagogically  trained  instructors  who  have  no  real  skills  experience.  In  view  of  this,  the \nProject will provide in-service training for instructors to improve teaching techniques.  \n\n \n\n\f30 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\nTable A3.3: Primary Vocational School Staffing, 2006 \n\nPosition Name \n\nStaff Positions \n\nPositions Filled \n\nA.

The PVE system was \noriginally  designed  for  90,000  students  but  many  classrooms,  training  workshops,  and \ndormitories  are  largely  underutilized  because  of  a  sharp  decrease  in  enrollment.  Lack  of  an \nassets  management  strategy  and  restrictive  legal  and  administrative  regulations  mean  that \nDVTE  is  not  in  a  position  to  manage  its  complex  range  of  assets  efficiently.  A  revision  of  the \ncurrent  legislative  and  administrative  framework  conditions  is  needed  to  enable  DVTE  to \nimprove  the  management  of  its  resources,  including  merging  schools,  selling  obsolete \nequipment,  and  closing  down  and  renting  out  underutilized  buildings.  Schools  with  small \nenrollment  have  considerably  higher  training  unit  costs  than  schools  with  higher  student \nenrollment.  \n \n9. \nPoor Quality and Relevance. The quality and relevance of PVE programs suffers from \nweak interaction with industry and communities, and lack of systematic labor market research. \nAlthough some PVSs have developed good linkages with local companies and provide relevant \nskills training, the majority of training programs are largely supply-driven and are often based on \nallocated  budgets  and  available  staff  and  equipment  rather  than  market  demand.  Failure  to \nshare information and resources between companies and PVSs creates a gap between supply \nand  demand  of  skilled  labors,  and  lowers  the  quality  and  relevance  of  training  programs. \nInstructors,  teachers,  and  school  managers  are  often  unable  to  fully  explore  ways  to  involve \nlocal employers and communities in skills identification, design of training programs, provision of \non-the-job training, and apprentice schemes.  \n \nQualification  of  Instructors  and  Teachers.  The  teaching  techniques  and  technical \n10. \nskills and knowledge of most instructors and teachers are outdated and need to be upgraded. \nMany teachers focus on delivering content, as specified in their curriculum, and not on achieving \nthe performance expected for employment. Under the Soviet system, teachers received periodic \nin-service  training.  However,  the  current  in-service  training has  become  infrequent because  of \nlimited  resources.  Instructors  have  no  benchmarks  to  measure  their  own  technical  and \ninstructional  capability,  so  they  have  no  means  of  determining  the  gap  between  their  current \nperformance  and  their  desired  capability.  Performance  specifications  and  skills  standards  are \nneeded  as  benchmarks  for  delivery  and  assessment.  A  systematic  monitoring  system\u2014to \nensure the quality of training programs\u2014is not in place. \n\n \n\n\f32 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\nCurriculum  Development.  The  PVE  curriculum  is  developed  by  the  Research  and \n11. \nMethodology  Department  under  DVTE.  Industry  involvement  in  curriculum  development  is \nlimited and current curriculum modules are not revised regularly to reflect changing technology \nand  market  demands.  The  curriculum  needs  to  be  adjusted  to  incorporate  student-centered \nmodern  teaching  methods  and  emphasis  on  a  stronger  practical  training  approach.  Many \ngraduates will find jobs or start self-employment in the informal sector, so entrepreneurship will \nbe one of the most important skills for many young people and entrepreneurship skills need to \nbe  incorporated  in  the  curriculum.  To  increase  job  opportunities,  particularly  in  the  informal \nsector, a modernized curriculum should support PVSs to produce multiskilled graduates.  \n \n12. \nLearning Material. Textbooks and learning and teaching materials in use are obsolete. \nMore  than  90%  of  1,100  textbook  titles  were  developed  before  1980,  and  less  than  5%  of \ncurrent  textbooks  have  been  revised  since  1990.  A  new  approach  in  training  material \ndevelopment\u2014promoting  independent  learning  and  practical  workshop  experience  with  the \ninvolvement  of  teachers  and  instructors  from  PVSs  and  experts  from  the  private  sector\u2014is \nrequired to produce modern learning materials for students.  \n \n13.  Weak  Assessment.  Currently,  no  comprehensive  system  for  skills  standards  and \nassessment is in place. The quality of skills training depends on the quality of instruction, which \nis  often  adversely  affected  by  lack  of  training  materials  and  equipment,  and  poor  teaching \nenvironment  and  outdated  knowledge  of  teachers.  PVSs  set  their  own  examinations,  without \nformal external quality control or moderation. Industry is only involved occasionally in preparing \nand participating in examinations.  \n \nLow Status. The status of PVE is low, and information among grade 8\u201311 students and \n14. \ntheir parents about job and income-earning opportunities for skilled workers in the informal and \nformal  sector  is  poor.  At  present,  the  Youth  Labor  Exchange  is  the  only  organization  that \nprovides  job  orientation  programs  in  secondary  schools  and  placement  support  for  youth. \nHowever,  the  capacity  of  the  Youth  Labor  Exchange  is  very  weak,  so  only  a  limited  number \nbenefit from its services.  \n \n15. \nTraining  Provision  for  Adults.  The  current  system  performs  poorly  in  terms  of \nproviding  market-oriented  skills  training  for  adults  and  out-of-school  youth.  Most  adults, \nparticularly the poor in rural areas, lack access to skills training that could enhance their earning \ncapacity. Relevant short-term training programs are offered in a limited manner by DVTE, other \nline  ministries,  and  a  few  private  providers\u2014mainly  in  urban  areas.  Currently,  no  skills \ndevelopment strategy is in place to address adult training and retraining needs.   \n \n16. \nPoor  Facilities.  Very  poor  infrastructure  and  lack  of  adequate  training  equipment  in \nmost PVSs  mean that students only \u201clearn\u201d about skills in theory but are not able to put them \ninto  practice.  This  lack  of  practical  training  reduces  their  employment  opportunities  after \ngraduation.  The  PVE  system  consists  of  112  schools  with  1,603  classrooms,  437  training \nworkshops,  56  computer  classrooms,  and  72  dormitories.  A  survey  revealed  that  41%  of  the \ntraining  workshops  are  in  poor  condition,  19%  in  very  poor  condition,  and  only  40%  in  good \ncondition.  Fifty-seven  percent  of  the  classrooms  are  considered  to  be  in  good  condition.  The \nbuilding  construction  and  technology  of  PVSs  that  have  not  yet  benefited  from  rehabilitation \nmeasures, are based on 30-year old construction standards which are inefficient in terms of use \nof materials, structural capacity, and energy performance. PVS facilities continue to deteriorate \nbecause  of  inadequate  maintenance  and  investment.  Roofs,  doors,  floors,  walls,  windows, \nelectrical  lighting,  and  heating  and  ventilation  systems  are  in  poor  condition  and  in  need  of \nurgent  repairs  or  rehabilitation.  Exhaust  systems  in  the  welding  and  carpentry  workshops  of \n\n\fAppendix 3 \n\n33 \n\nmany  PVSs  do  not  function,  which  allows  fumes  and  dust  particles  to  linger  inside  training \nworkshops during practical exercises. Workbenches, worktables, and furniture in the workshops \nare  also  in  dilapidated  condition.  Poor  sanitation  facilities  pose  significant  hygiene  and  health \nrisks, especially for students in dormitory facilities.  \n \n17.  Most  training  equipment  in  PVSs  was  supplied  during  the  Soviet  era;  it  is  outdated  or \ndoes  not  function,  and  is  only  displayed  for  demonstration  purposes.  Hand  tools,  sufficient \nconsumables,  teaching  aids,  and  learning  materials  are  lacking  in  training  workshops,  which \nconstrains practical skills training. Most PVSs do not have computers for either administration or \nteaching. Facility provision to cater to the needs of students with physical disabilities is largely \nnonexistent\u2014simple  facilities  such  as  access  ramps  that  can  provide  mobility  to  wheelchair-\nbound students are not available, toilet facilities are not adjusted to the needs of handicapped \nstudents,  and  training  equipment  and  school  furniture  designed  for  handicapped  students  is \nlacking. Under these conditions, persons with physical disabilities are indirectly deprived of the \nopportunity to learn job skills.  \n \n\n \n\n\f34 \n\nAppendix 4 \n\nFINANCING OF PRIMARY VOCATIONAL EDUCATION  \n\n \n1. \nThe  primary  vocational  education  (PVE)  sector  is  mainly  financed  from  two  sources: \n(i) public  budget  (including  the  national  and  oblast  budgets),19  and  (ii)  income  generation  by \nprimary  vocational  schools  (PVSs).  Public  expenditure  on  education  (PEE)  has  remained  at \nabout  4%  of  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  over  recent  years  and  is  expected  to  rise  from \n4.02% in 2004 to 4.93% in 2008. This is comparable with other transition economies, e.g., the \neducation  sector\u2019s  share  of  GDP  in  Kazakhstan  was  3.9%  in  2004.  However,  PVE  funding  of \nPVE  is  very  low.  Teacher  and  instructor  salaries  have  not  been  inflation  adjusted  since  1997, \nand need to be enhanced to improve motivation and attract new qualified staff. The Government \nhas  acknowledged  the  need  for  salary  increases  and  has  raised  PVE  budget  provisions  for \n2006,  2007,  and  2008.  Table  A4.1  provides  an  overview  of  education  expenditures  as  a \nproportion of GDP in 2004 and 2005, and estimates from 2006 to 2009. \n \n\nTable A4.1: PVE Expenditure as Proportion of GDP and Total Public Expenditure \n(Som million) \n\nItems \n\n2004 \n\n2005 \n\n2006a \n\n2007a \n\n2008a \n\nGDP  \n\nTPE  \n\nPEE  \n\nPEE as share of GDP (%) \n\nPEE as share of TPE (%) \n\nPublic Expenditure on General \nEducation (grade 1\u201311) \n\nPublic Expenditure on Higher \nEducation \n\nPublic Expenditure on Secondary \nVocational Education \n\nPublic Expenditure on Primary \nVocational Education  \nOther Education Expenditureb \n\n94,078.0 \n\n102,846.2 \n\n113,372.9 \n\n124,729.4 \n\n137,282.2 \n\n27,954.1 \n\n30,654.8 \n\n33,980.1 \n\n36,616.7 \n\n39,145.1 \n\n3,784.2 \n\n4,232.3 \n\n5,521.2 \n\n6,055.0 \n\n6,765.2 \n\n4.02 \n\n13.54 \n\n4.12 \n\n13.81 \n\n4.87 \n\n16.25 \n\n4.85 \n\n16.54 \n\n4.93 \n\n17.28 \n\n2,080.7 \n\n2,433.9 \n\n3,326.8 \n\n3,738.9 \n\n4,023.3 \n\n196.5 \n\n219.0 \n\n225.1 \n\n231.2 \n\n237.5 \n\n88.4 \n\n150.2 \n\n163.5 \n\n234.2 \n\n277.2 \n\n339.5 \n\n177.6 \n \n\n369.8 \n\n194.0 \n\n406.0 \n\n1,184.40 \n\n1,152.00 \n\n1,466.30 \n\n1,537.50 \n\n1,904.40 \n\nPVE as share of PEE (%) \n\n6.2 \n\n6.6 \n\n6.2 \n\n6.1 \n\n6.0 \n\nGDP = gross domestic product, PEE = public expenditure on education, PVE = primary vocational education,   \nTPE = total public expenditure.  \na  Ministry of Economy and Finance estimates. \nb    Includes  preschool  education;  out-of-school  services;  and,  development  of  methodology  and  education \n\nsupport service, management, and administration. \n\nSource: Ministry of Economy and Finance, Medium-Term Budget Framework 2006\u20132008. \n \n\n2. \nPVE  Expenditure  Categories.  In  2005,  expenditures  comprised  (i)  personnel  costs, \nincluding  salaries  and  contributions  to  the  social  security  fund,  allowances,  and  insurance \nschemes  paid  by  the  employer  (45%);  (ii)  social  protection  expenditures,  including  student \nallowances and school food (31%); (iii) utilities, including water, electricity, and heating (11%); \nand  (iv)  13%  of  the  fund  allocation  remains  to  cover  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M) \nexpenditures of training workshops, building repairs, and purchase of consumables and learning \nmaterials.  Table  A4.2  and  Figure  A4.1  provide  an  overview  of  financing  sources  and \nexpenditure categories in 2005.  \n                                                 \n19 From a total of 112 PVSs, 74 are funded from the national budget and 38 from oblast budgets.  \n\n\fAppendix 4 \n\n35 \n\n \n3. \nPVS Income Generation. Although PVSs lack adequate equipment and operate under \nvery  poor  infrastructure  conditions,  the  112  PVSs  generated  revenues  of  Som39.8  million  in \n2005, or 12.6% of total PVE expenditures. The main sources of income are tuition fees (42%), \nproduction  activities  (15%),  agriculture  activities,  and  other  service  provision  (32%).  It  can  be \nassumed  that  PVS  income  generation  will  be  doubled  within  3  years  once  training  workshops \nare  rehabilitated,  new  equipment  is  in  place,  and  the  Project  has  provided  training  on \nentrepreneurial approaches. This is a conservative estimate, as some of the schools are now at \na very low base of income generation because they do not have much to offer, and very limited \ncapacity to make products or provide services.  \n \n\nTable A4.2: Expenditure Categories in 2005 \n(Som\u2019000) \n\nItem \n\nNational \nBudget \n\nOblasta \nBudget \n\nSubtotal \nPublic \nBudget \n\nIncome-\nGeneration \nFund \n\nTotal \n\n% \n\nIncome Generation  \n\n216,908 \n\n60,241 \n\n277,149 \n\n39,888 \n\n317,038 \n\n100 \n\nA.

The  average  size  of  PVS  enrollment  is  relatively  small.  In  2005,  24,148 \nstudents  were  enrolled  in  112  PVSs\u2014an  average  of  215  students  per  school.  Schools  with \nsmall  enrollment  have  considerably  higher  training  unit  costs  than  schools  with  larger  student \nenrollment. Training unit costs in PVSs with less than 100 students are Som14.9 while training \nunit costs in schools with more than 350 students are only Som5.8. At present, only 15 schools \nout  of  112  PVSs  have  more  than  350  students  enrolled.  The  main  reason  for  this  is  the  high \nratio  of  nonteaching  staff  in  small  schools.  A  consolidated  system  will  improve  utilization  of \nfacilities  and  ensure  more  efficient  staff  deployment.  Restructured  and  merged  PVSs  with \nefficient  staff  structures  will  be  more  flexible  to  respond  to  changing  labor  market  demands. \nTable  A4.3  compares  the  unit  costs  of  schools  by  enrollment  size.

The combined effects of (i) restructuring and rationalizing \nthe  current  PVE  system,  which  will  result  in  more  efficient  utilization  infrastructure  and  staff \nresources; and (ii) applying an entrepreneurial management approach that will increase revenue \ngeneration at school level, will ensure cost-effective improvements of the PVE system.  \n \nThe  Government\u2019s  contribution  to  the  Project  is  estimated  at  $3.0  million  over  4  years \n6. \nand  mainly  includes  (i)  taxes  and  duties  on  civil  works,  equipment,  and  materials  purchased \nunder the Project; (ii) staff contributions; and (iii) provision of office facilities and workshops. To \ndate,  provisional  financial  projections  have  only  been  made  until  2008.  Although  there  is  no \nfinancial  information  beyond  2008,  it  can  be  assumed  that  the  Government  is  committed  to \nreform the PVE system; it has indicated that it will increase PVE allocation after 2008 to offset \ninflation increases and ensure sufficient budget for O&M for rehabilitated schools. During project \nimplementation, project costs for the Government will be from 0.4% to 0.5% of total expenditure \non education; such project costs are insignificant. It can be assumed that project activities are \nsustainable, taking into account (i) anticipated increased proceeds from PVS income generation \nactivities, (ii) cost-effective improvements of the PVE system through consolidation, and (iii) the \nstrong commitment of the Government to support restructuring of the PVE system.  \n \n\nTable A4.4: GDP, Public Expenditure on Education,  \nand Government Share in the Project \n(Som \u2018000) \n\n \n\nItem \nGDP (Som billion) \n \nPEE (Som million) \n \nPublic Expenditure on PVE \n(Som million) \n \nPVE Income Generation \n(Som million) \n  \nGovernment Share in the \nProject (Som million) \n \nGovernment Share in the \nProject (% of PEE) \n\n2003 \n83.4 \n\n2004 \n94.1 \n\n2005 \n102.8 \n\n2006 \n113.4 \n\n2007 \n124.7 \n\n2008 \n137.3 \n\n3,555 \n\n3,784.2 \n\n4,232.3 \n\n5,521.2 \n\n6,055.0 \n\n6,765.2 \n\n234.2 \n\n277.2 \n\n339.5 \n\n369.8 \n\n406.0 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n39.8 \n\n45 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n50 \n\n30 \n\n70 \n\n30 \n\n0.49 \n\n0.44 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nGDP = gross domestic product, PEE = public expenditure on education, PVE = primary vocational education. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nIncome  Generation.  Most  PVSs  currently  operate  in  a  difficult  environment,  with  poor \n7. \nworkshop  facilities  and  lack  of  adequate  training  equipment.  They  have  very  limited  means  to \ngenerate income, but the PVS system managed to generate revenue of about Som40 million in \n2005.  It  is  assumed  that  schools  will  increase  their  revenues  (Table  A4.5)  after  (i)  the  PVE \nsystem  is  consolidated,  (ii)  training  workshops  of  selected  PVSs  are  rehabilitated  and  newly \nequipped, and (iii) school management applies an entrepreneurial management approach.  \n \n8. \nTo project future income generation, the following potential scenario is assumed. Based \non  income  generation  in  2005,  it  is  assumed  that  revenue  generation  through  tuition  fees  will \nincrease by 10% per year. For 2006 and 2007, it is estimated that income generation through \nproduction, and agriculture activities and service provision, will rise by  8%. In 2008 and 2009, \nafter training workshops are rehabilitated and equipped, and school management operates in an \nentrepreneurial manner, it is assumed that income generation will increase further\u2014production \nand agriculture activities, and service provision will increase by 15%. In 2010, a 20% increase is \nassumed  in  all  three  income  areas  after  more  schools  benefit  under  the  Project  through  new \nequipment and entrepreneurial training. \n\n \n\n\f38 \n\nAppendix 4 \n\n9. \nThe  Project  will  introduce  a  system  of  short-term  skill  courses  for  out-of-school  youth \nand  adults.  After  upgrading  workshop  facilities  and  developing  new  demand-driven  short \ncourses, it is assumed that PVS will start providing training courses for adults and out-of-school \nyouth from 2008 onward. In 2008, it is assumed that 2,000 participants will enroll in short-term \ncourses; in 2009, 4,000 youth and adults will enroll in courses; and in 2010, 5,000 participants \nwill benefit from short-term skills training. Course fees will be paid partly by the participants and \nsponsored  by  the  Government  through  the  Employment  Funds  under  the  National  Office  of \nMigration and Ministry of Labor and Social Protection (MLSP). It is assumed that the course fee \nper participant will be about Som3,600 on average.  \n \n10. \nFrom 2008 onward, through consolidation efforts, it is assumed that the PVE system will \ngenerate  income  by  selling  obsolete  equipment  and  renting  out  underutilized  buildings \n(Table A4.5). \n \n\nTable A4.5: Projections for Primary Vocational School Income Generation  \n(Som million) \n2006 \n18.5 \n6.5 \n4.8 \n13.8 \n\n2005 \n16.8       (42%)\n6.0       (15%)\n4.4       (11%)\n12.8       (32%)\n\n    2007 \n20.2 \n7.0 \n5.2 \n14.9 \n\n2008 \n22.4 \n8.1 \n6.0 \n17.1 \n7.2 \n3.0 \n63.8 \n\n2009 \n24.6 \n9.3 \n6.9 \n19.7 \n14.4 \n5.0 \n79.9 \n\n2010 \n27.1 \n11.2 \n8.3 \n23.6 \n18.0 \n6.5 \n94.7 \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n40     (100%)\n\n43.6 \n\n47.3 \n\nItem \nTuition Fee \nProduction Activities  \nAgriculture Activities \nService Provision  \nShort Skills Courses \nAsset Management \n        Total \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nTo determine whether there will be sufficient funds available to cover the expenditures of \n11. \na  consolidated  PVE  system,  an  assessment  was  made  based  on  (i)  the  expenditure  in  2005, \nand  (ii)  the  draft  estimated  and  projected  budget  for  2006\u20132008  as  indicated  in  the  Medium \nTerm  Budget  Framework  of  the  Ministry  of  Finance.  To  provide  an  outlook  for  2010,  a  6% \nincrease of the public PVE budget was assumed for 2009 and 2010. This increase is arbitrary \nand  is  used  to  illustrate  a  potential  scenario  in  2009.  The  major  share  of  increases  in  PVE \nfunding  for  2006\u20132008  are  committed  to  raise  teachers\u2019  salaries  and  increase  the  daily \nallowance for food.  \n \n\nTable A4.6: Projections for Allocation, Income Generation, and Expenditures \n(Som million) \n\nItem \nA.

The Government has indicated that will increase \n12. \nallowances  for  school  food  by  26%  in  2006;  9%  in  2007;  and  10%  in  2008  (Table  A4.6).  In \naddition, an increase of 5% is assumed for 2009 and 2010. \n \nStaff Expenditure. It can be assumed that the budget increases for 2006\u20132008 will be \n13. \nused  to  raise  teacher  salaries  by  20%  in  2006;  8%  in  2007;  and  9%  in  2008.  An  increase  of \nabout 5% is assumed for 2009 and 2010. In addition to salary increases financed by the public \nbudget, teachers and instructors will benefit from incentives provided through income generation \nat  school  level;  it  is  assumed  that  about  10%  of  income  generation  will  be  utilized  for  staff \nincentives. It is expected that the number of nonteaching staff will be reduced gradually during \nthe consolidation process, which will lead to a reduction in staff expenditure of 10% in 2008 and \n2009 and 5% in 2010. It is assumed that \u201cOther Expenditure\u201d (including allowances and training \nmeasures)  will  increase  by  5%  in  2006  and  by  10%  in  subsequent  years  to  cover  increased \nexpenditure for training programs conducted under the Project. The combined effects of these \nassumptions are reflected in Table A4.6 under the staff and other costs expenditure category. \n \nThe  total  increases  for  staff  expenditures  will  be  sufficient  to  improve  the  working \n14. \nconditions  and  motivation  of  PVE  staff,  and  finance  training  measures  planned  under  the \nProject.  \n \nUtility  Expenditure.  Utility  costs  (particularly  heating  and  electricity)  will  decrease \n15. \nbecause of (i) rehabilitation measures of existing workshops, classrooms, and dormitories; and \n(ii)  consolidation  of  physical  infrastructure.  The  following  scenario  is  used  to  demonstrate  the \nimpact: (i) an annual inflation-related 5% increase; (ii) a 10% reduction caused by rehabilitation \nand consolidation of PVE infrastructure in 2007; and (iii) a 15% reduction in 2008 and 2009, and \na 10% reduction in 2010.  \n \n16. \nExpenditure  on  Repairs,  O&M,  and  Consumables.  The  current  funding  level  for \nbuilding  repair,  O&M,  and  purchase  of  consumables  is  a  serious  issue.  In  2005,  only \nSom17 million  was  available  for  these  expenditure  categories.  In  2005,  funds  for  O&M  and \nconsumables are about Som11 million, or about an average of Som460 per student. To sustain \ntraining  workshops  and  provide  adequate  consumables  for  practical  hands-on  training,  an \naverage  of  Som4,000  per  student  is  required.  Based  on  the  current  scenario,  about \nSom96 million  would  be  needed  for  workshop  operations\u2014assuming  that  all  workshops  are \nrehabilitated,  adequately  equipped,  and  in  full  operation  to  provide  practical  training  for  about \n24,000  students.  Further,  it  is  assumed  that  at  least  Som10  million  per  year  is  required  to \nensure  building  maintenance,  including  minor  repairs.  This  scenario  indicates  that,  from  2010 \nonward, sufficient funds will be available for O&M and workshop consumables\u2014ensuring quality \nhands-on  training.  The  potential  surplus  could  be  used  to  procure  additional  consumables  to \ncater for a possible increase in student enrollment. \n \n17. \nThese  projections  indicate  that  caution  is  required  with  respect  to  fund  allocations  for \nO&M  and  consumables  during  the  first  3  years  of  project  implementation.  To  mitigate  risks \nduring this period, the Project will provide a lump sum to rehabilitated workshops to support the \nfirst year of operation. After project completion, the risk of insufficient public funds for O&M and \nadequate  consumables  will  be  addressed  by  the  Project\u2019s  strategy  to  reduce  dependency  on \npublic  allocations  by  promoting  an  entrepreneurial  approach  and  strengthening  income \ngeneration at PVS level.  \n \n18. \nAdditional  funding  needs  were  examined  for  rehabilitating  and  upgrading  schools  in  a \nconsolidated  PVE  system.  Supplementary  to  the  contribution  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank \n\n \n\n\f40 \n\nAppendix 4 \n\n(ADB),  $26  million  would  be  required  to  address  all  capital  investment  needs.  The  illustrated \nscenario indicates that potential surpluses are modest in terms of funds required to rehabilitate \nand equip all schools within the system. The Government will depend on external assistance to \nmeet future challenges in rehabilitating and upgrading all schools in the PVE system. \n \nBenefits.  Government  provision  of  PVE  is  justified  because  of  imperfect  market \n19. \nconditions  and  lack  of  adequate  private  training  provision  and  financing.20  Youth  training \nprograms  offered  by  private  training  institutions  are  limited  to  a  few  sectors  in  urban  areas. \nStudents from rural areas are disadvantaged in gaining access to private training, and children \nfrom  poor  families  cannot  afford  training  fees.  As  private  training  provision  has  inadequate \ncapacity,  MLSP  will  need  to  provide  PVE  for  youth  to  (i)  promote  social  equity  through \neducation, and (ii) provide the means to gain employable skills and knowledge for students who \nare  not  able  to  advance  to  higher  education.  Reform  of  the  current  PVE  system\u2014to  become \nflexible  and  demand-driven\u2014will  enhance  productivity  and  incomes  for  graduates  and \ncompanies, and contribute to economic growth.  \n \nThe  major  beneficiaries  of  the  Project  will  be  about  24,000  students  enrolled  in  PVS. \n20. \nRelevant  courses  with  practical  training  and  hands-on  experience,  and  improved  student-\ncentered teaching methods in an entrepreneurial environment, will (i) enhance the technical and \ncognitive  proficiency  of  students,  (ii)  develop  problem  solving  ability,  and  (iii)  make  students \nmore  productive  in  future  employment.  The  desired  impact  of  the  Project  is  improved \nemployability and income-earning opportunities for graduates. However, it is difficult to quantify \nbenefits  for  PVS  graduates  in  economic  terms,  as  education  alone  is  not  sufficient  to  raise \nincomes. Job opportunities and salary structures depend on various other economic factors. \n \n21.  Without the Project. Most benefits discussed above would be forgone. There would be \nconsiderable uncertainty regarding the Government\u2019s capacity to reform the PVE system into a \nflexible  demand-driven  system.  Increasing  the  supply  of  trained  youth  will  not  create \nemployment  by  itself.  Close  linkages  with  the  labor  market  are  the  most  important  economic \nrequirements for a PVE system. The current PVE system was established during the Soviet era \nwhere  supply  and  demand  of  labor  was  planned  centrally.  Without  the  Project,  students  will \ncontinue  to  graduate  from  a  system  that  is  not  responsive  to  industry  needs,  suffers  from \noutdated curriculum and training equipment, and does not provide students with adequate skills \nand knowledge to find jobs after graduation.  \n  \n \n\n \n\n                                                 \n20 The purchase  of PVE is beyond the means of many  poor  families in the  Kyrgyz  Republic. Credit markets do  not \nprovide loans to low-income families to finance their children\u2019s education. Poor adults and out-of-school youth from \nlow-income  families  with  low  education  background  are  less  informed  than  better  educated  parents  about  the \nbenefits or quality of PVE, and may underinvest in PVE. \n\n\fDETAILED COST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING PLAN \nTable A5.1: Detailed Cost Estimates by Expenditure Category \n($\u2019000) \n\nComponent \n1 \n \n \n\nComponent \n2 \n \n \n\nComponent \n3 \n \n \n\nComponent \n4 \n \n \n\nProject \nManagement \n \n \n\nPhysical \nContingencies \nAmount \n% \n \n \n\nItem \n\n \n\nA.

In  implementing  these \nactivities,  the  Government  will  ensure  that  the  poor  and  vulnerable  groups  of  society  have  equal  access  to  basic \nsocial services, thus supporting their opportunities for employment and participation in economic activities.  \n \nSurveys in rural areas where the majority of the population lives suggest that up to 70% of PVE students belong to \npoor families. Given the evidence in poverty and low level of education, the Project will contribute to increase income \nearning opportunities for poor students by reforming the current PVE system to become relevant and demand driven. \nImproving  the  teaching  and  learning  environment  through  school  rehabilitation  and  upgrading  of  facilities  and \nstrengthening the system of professional development for teachers, the Project will contribute towards ensuring that \neducational services are accessible in all areas, particularly in rural areas, and for poor groups. Improving dormitory \naccommodation  in  PVS  will  give  better  opportunities  for  children  from  poor  remote  households  to  attend  vocational \neducation.  \n \nThe  introduction  of  short-term  skills  courses  strengthening  entrepreneurship  skills  and  providing  training  that \npromotes multiskilled workers will particularly help out-of-school youth and unemployed or underemployed adults to \nimprove their income earning opportunities in the informal sector. \n  \n\nB.  Poverty Analysis                                         Targeting Classification: Targeted Intervention (MDG) \n \nIn 2005, 36% of the total population lived in poverty with an annual income below $225 per year and about 13% of \nthe  population  are  considered  to  be  extremely  poor  with  an  income  less  than  $140  per  day.  Poverty  in  rural  areas \nwas higher than in urban areas. \nThe recent analysis finds that the negative impact of poverty on a child\u2019s dropout from school is significant at every \nlevel of schooling, even at the primary level where completion rates are near universal, and it has the largest effect on \nupper secondary dropout. Poverty directly, through out-of-pocket and opportunity costs, as well as indirectly, through \nfamily/parental background, affects children\u2019s educational outcomes.  Furthermore, educational quality as measured \nby  examination  results  is  significantly  lower  in  rural  areas  and  the  quality  of  teaching  influences  parental  decisions \nwhether to keep their children in school or not.   \n \nIn  effect,  poverty  is  an  important  factor  in  determining  whether  a  child  is  enrolled  in  school  or  not.    Yet  without \nunhampered access to quality education, opportunities for earning a reasonable income and rising above the poverty \nline are restricted: indeed, those with at least completed secondary education are significantly less likely to be poor. \n \n\n  Yes \n\n   No  \n\nC.  Participation Process \nIs there a stakeholder analysis? \nThe main institutional stakeholders include DVTE, MLSP, oblast (province) and raion (district) authorities (especially \nthose  with  an  education  department),  PVS  management,  local  employers,  industry  associations,  private  training \nproviders and civil society groups. The primary stakeholders are instructors, teachers and students.  \n \nIs there a participation strategy? \nThe Project was designed in a participatory process involving major government and nongovernment stakeholders at \nnational and oblast level, school directors, instructors and teachers, students and parents, community leaders, private \ntraining  providers,  local  employers  and  industry  representatives  from  various  trades,  and  development  partners. \nParticipation  took  place  through  regular  consultations,  series  of  workshops  and  presentations.  During  the \nimplementation,  the  Project  will  maintain  broad  stakeholder  participation.  Nongovernmental  stakeholders  will \nparticipate  In  the  Project  Steering  Committee  and  in  the  Selection  Committee  for  school  rehabilitation  and  up \ngradation. \n \nFurther, the Project will encourage (a) wide consultation in the development of new curriculum modules and training \nmaterials,  (b)  greater  community  and  employer  participation  in  supervising  and  ensuring  the  quality  of  (i)  school \n\n   Yes              \n\n   No \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 9 \n\n59 \n\nrehabilitation  work  and  equipment  procurement  and  (ii)  school  facilities  maintenance,  and  (iii)  partnership  between \nlocal employers and PVS in developing and delivering market-oriented training programmes for out-of school youth \nand adults.  \n \n\nD.  Gender Development \nStrategy to maximize impacts on gender: \nThe Kyrgyz Republic is a signatory to all important international labor conventions including those pertaining to child \nlabor and gender equality. No gender bias in access to general education exists in the Kyrgyz Republic. Children of \nboth  genders  have  equal  opportunity  to  receive  basic  education,  which  is  granted  free  under  the  Constitution. \nTraditionally more male youth enroll in PVE than female. The ratio in PVE is 63%:37%. To address the gender issues \nin  PVE,  the  Project  will  carry  out  awareness  campaigns  that  reinforce  the  right  of  all  boys  and  girls  to  attend  PVE \nschools  and  inform  parents  and  grade  8-11  students  about  employment  and  income  opportunities  of  girls.
