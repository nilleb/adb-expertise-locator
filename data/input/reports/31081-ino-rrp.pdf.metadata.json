The  economic  viability  of the  five  core subprojects  selected  were  analyzed  as  a\nbasis for preparing  the Project. Economic analysis determined  the incremental  benefits  and\ncosts accruing  from the subproject implementation.\n1. Benefits\n8.  The Project will benefit the economy at large by providing a pool of technicians and\nprofessionals with appropriate knowledge to make useful contribution to economic recovery\nand long-term sustainable industrial, commercial, and agricultural growth of Indonesia. The\nProject is designed to make the higher education institutions more responsive to  labor\nmarket needs.  The Project will also benefit graduates of  the participating institutions who,\nby receiving better quality and more relevant education in priority programs, should be able\nto  find  suitable  initial  employment  upon  graduation  and  secure  continued  career\ndevelopment. The staff development activity of the Project will benefit teachers of higher\neducation  institutions  by  improving their  skills  to  keep  pace  with  technological\ndevelopments.E nterprisesa nd other employersw ill benefitf rom the availability of a better\ntrained pool of skilled technicians and professionals,f acilitating improved production quality,\nincreased productivity, and more efficient management. In addition, the Project will result in\nmore cost-effective use of public and private financing of higher education.\n9.  Most of the benefits are difficult to quantify. There is no standard procedure to\nquantify benefits in education projects and no estimates of the positive externalities from\npublic  investment  in  higher education are available. A  difference  in  earnings  of  the\ngraduates is considered an appropriate measure of the social benefits of the investment.\nThe Project is expected to lead to higher lifetime earnings of the graduates of the project\ninstitutions by:\n(i)  reducing the time needed for students to graduate from 5.75 to 5.00 years\n(ii)  reducing the time the graduates take to find their first job, and\n(iii)  increasing starting salaries of graduates once employed.\n10.\na Indonesia\nstudents those\nwould decline\nstudents\n11.
