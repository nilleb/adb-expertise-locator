The \nProject  is  classified  under  environmental  category  B  and \nresettlement category A. \n   \nProject Description  The Project seeks to enable an intermediary state of development \nfor Thanh Hoa and support its socioeconomic enhancement. It is \na comprehensive and multisectoral project that will target priority \ninvestments  and  create  a  suitable  and  sustainable  urban \nenvironment for Thanh Hoa and strengthen its role as provincial \ncapital.  The  Project  will  upgrade  Thanh  Hoa\u2019s  urban  core, \nintegrate  its  peri-urban  areas  and  further  develop  its  urban \ninfrastructure and key economic sectors. The expected outputs \nwill be: (i) an improved urban road network (22 km) and urban \nbasic services to link peri-urban urban villages with the city center \nalong with complementary basic urban services; (ii) an expanded \nand upgraded water supply distribution network, including about \n19  km  of  primary  and  secondary  water  supply  pipes  and \nconnections  to  expand  the  service  to  peri-urban  areas  and \nreplacement of 19 km of damaged pipes in the city; (iii) improved \ndrainage and wastewater treatment in Thanh Hoa through the \nconstruction of 47 km of interceptors for sewerage and drainage, \n13 pumping stations, a central wastewater treatment pond, and \nthree  delocalized  wastewater  treatment  facilities  for  the  city \ngeneral hospital; (iv) improved human resources and skills within \nlocal utilities and line departments of Thanh Hoa and THP and \nimproved  labor  skills,  achieved  through  the  upgrading  of \nvocational training centers and other capacity building initiatives; \nand  (v)  a  well-managed  tourism  development  through  the \nconstruction of tourism facilities at tourist sites in Ham  Rong and \nMat Son.  \n   \nRationale  The  proposed  Project  will  support  the  Government\u2019s  Socio- \nEconomic Development Plan (SEDP) 2006\u20132010. One of the key \nSEDP objectives is to support sustained urban development, in \nline with the Orientation Master Plan for Urban Development to \n2020, which outlines the official national urban policy. This plan \naims to establish population targets for cities and limit migration to \nHa Noi and Ho Chi Minh City through the promotion of sustainable ", "ii \ndevelopment of secondary cities. \nThe country strategy of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for \nViet  Nam\u2019s  urban  sector  emphasizes  targeted  infrastructure \ninvestments  in  small-  and  medium-sized  towns  in  the  central \nregion and along economic corridors, thereby reducing migration \nto the large metropolises. \nThanh Hoa was selected for this comprehensive socioeconomic \ndevelopment initiative based on social and economic criteria such \nas  urban  population  growth,  urban  and  rural  poverty  levels, \neconomic development potential, and infrastructure needs. Thanh \nHoa is the capital and the only major urban center of Viet Nam's \nthird  largest,  second  poorest,  and  second  most  populous \nprovince. Thanh Hoa, with a population of 200,000, represents \nonly  about  5%  of  THP's  3.7  million  people.  Currently  the \nprovince's  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  is  half  the  national \naverage.  The  economy  is  weak  in  all  sectors,  especially  the \nindustrial and social sectors, which rank well below the national \naverage according to various indexes. Thanh Hoa is challenged to \nmeet  the  ever-growing  demand  for  basic  urban  services  and \nreverse the large outflow of migration from both Thanh Hoa city \nand  province.  Thanh  Hoa  is  thus  a  prime  candidate  for  ADB \nassistance. \n   \nImpact and Outcome  The  main  impact  of  the  Project  will  be  the  sustained \nsocioeconomic development of Thanh Hoa that will directly benefit \nabout 75,000 people in THP, and indirectly benefit about 270,000 \npeople in Thanh Hoa and its suburbs. The intended outcome is a \nwell-managed, livable, and competitive city. \n   \nProject Investment Plan  The  project  investment  cost  is  estimated  at  $117.9  million, \nincluding taxes and duties of $9.4 million. The total cost includes \nphysical  and  price  contingencies  and  interest  during \nimplementation. \n ", "iii \n  Table 1: Project Investment Plan \n($ million) \nItem      Amounts \nA.

Each  project  component  will  be \ndelegated to a project implementation unit (PIU), which will be \nintegrated in the existing management structure. The Executing \nAgency will establish a project steering committee (PSC), which \nwill  meet  at  least  four  times  a  year  to  assess  the  project \nimplementation status. Coordination at the community level will be \ncarried out through the Commune Management Council (CMC). \nThe CMC will deal with implementation of the resettlement plan, \nthe IEE, the gender action plan, and resolution of related issues at \nthe community level. \n   \nExecuting Agency  Thanh Hoa Provincial People\u2019s Committee \n   \n \n \n ", "v \nProcurement  All procurement to be financed under the ADB loan will be carried \nout in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as \namended from time to time). The civil works to be funded from the \nADB loan will be procured through (i) international competitive \nbidding (ICB) procedures for contracts exceeding $2.0 million, and \n(ii) national competitive bidding (NCB) procedures for contracts of \nless than $2.0 million. The equipment to be funded from the ADB \nloan will be procured through (i) ICB procedures for contracts \nexceeding $500,000; (ii) limited international bidding procedures \nfor contracts between $100,000 and $500,000; and (iii) shopping \nprocedures for contracts of less than $100,000. \n   \nConsulting Services  Consulting  services  will  be  procured  through  five  contracts. \n  Consultants for the Project's urban road development component \n(component  1)  will  be  funded  from  the  Government  of  the \nRepublic of Korea loan, using Government  of the Republic of \nKorea procurement procedures. The second contract will involve \nconsultants for components 2\u20135, which cover design, bidding, and \nconstruction supervision, will be funded from the ADB loan using \nthe quality- and cost-based selection procedure. In addition, one \nnational individual consultant will be recruited independently to \ncarry out resettlement monitoring, and one independent auditing \nfirm will be recruited using the simplified technical proposal, under \ntwo  separate  contracts.  The  capacity  building  grant  will  be \nallocated to a firm selected using QCBS procedure and simplified \ntechnical  proposal  and  individual  consultants.  All  ADB-funded \nprocurement for consulting services will be made in accordance \nwith  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2007,  as \namended from time to time). The technical proposals will be given \na weight of 80% and the financial proposals will be given a weight \nof 20%. \n \nProject Benefits and  The social assessment carried out under a project preparatory \nBeneficiaries  technical assistance (PPTA) project concluded that, although the \npoverty rate has been decreasing, Thanh Hoa will need to embark \non development that is more socially inclusive. Such development \nshould target vulnerable groups such as the poor in peri-urban \nareas and should be carried out in combination with investments \nin  citywide  infrastructure,  human  resource  development,  and \nimproved  urban  management.  The  social  assessment  also \nhighlighted the need for private sector investment to create job \nopportunities,  which  in  turn  will  improve  living  standards  and \nalleviate poverty. By 2020, the Project will directly benefit about \n75,000  people  living  in  urban  and  peri-urban  areas  though \nimproved access roads and provision of urban basic services. By \n2020  the  Project  will  indirectly  benefit  the  200,000  people  of \nThanh Hoa as well as an additional estimated 70,000 people in \noutlying areas and townships. It is also expected that the project \nwill indirectly benefit THP by reversing the out-migration process \nand provide the necessary base investment for Thanh Hoa to \ndevelop as a provincial capital. \n ", "vi \nEach component shows a satisfactory economic internal rate of \nreturn  (EIRR);  the  overall  EIRR  for  the  Project  has  not  been \ncalculated because different methodologies are used for revenue-\ngenerating  and  nonrevenue  generating  components.  However, \nthe Project is viable as a whole. The urban road development \ncomponent is economically viable with an EIRR of 17.2%. The \nanalysis found an EIRR of 14.9% for the water supply component \nand 19% for the tourism component. The drainage component \nhas been analyzed using the least cost method and the human \nresources development component is highly justified. Sensitivity \nanalysis  confirms  the  robustness  of  the  Project\u2019s  economic \nviability. \nA  financial  analysis  was  performed  on  the  water  supply  and \ndrainage  components.  Investing  in  these  components  will \ncontribute to improving the networks and expanding the service \narea to peri-urban villages (about 75,000 inhabitants). For water \nsupply, the financial internal rate of return over the project life is \nestimated at 15.3% while for drainage it is 4.2%; both are higher \nthan the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) of 1.5%. \nOne of the key features of the Project is the institutional reform \nagenda  and  capacity  building  proposed  for  the  water  and \nwastewater companies. New legislation enacted in 2007 by the \nGovernment  of  Viet  Nam  requires  water  and  wastewater \ncompanies to undergo reforms, such as incorporation as joint-\nstock companies, undergoing equitization (partial privatization) by \n2010, and implementation of full cost recovery for water supply \ncompanies and partial cost recovery for wastewater companies. \nThis program will be funded through a grant from ADB's managed \nwater financing partnership facility. \n   \nRisks and Assumptions  Several  risks  face  the  Project,  including  the  potential  lack  of \ncommitment from the Project\u2019s beneficiaries (resulting from a lack \nof  ownership),  currency  fluctuations  and  other  macroeconomic \nchanges, and unanticipated external economic events. \nThe  Project\u2019s  success  is  based  on  the  following  assumptions:\n(i)  the  Government,  ADB,  and  key  stakeholders  ensure  that \nqualified consultants and personnel are recruited for the Project, \nand that disbursements of counterpart and other funds are made \nin a timely manner; (ii) commitment of people's committees to \nundertake policy and institutional reforms; (iii) implementation of \nsuggested  cost-recovery  mechanisms  and  tariff  adjustments;\n(iv) active participation and sense of ownership from stakeholders \nand project beneficiaries; (v) stakeholder and beneficiary support \nfor the Project; and (vi) implementation of environmental, social, \nand resettlement requirements. \n ", " \n \n \n ", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nloan, (ii) proposed administration of a grant from the Multidonor Trust Fund for the Water \nFinancing Partnership Facility, and (iii) proposed administration of a grant from the Netherlands \nTrust Fund for the Water Financing Partnership Facility to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for \nthe Thanh Hoa City Comprehensive Socioeconomic Development Project. The design and \nmonitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n2.  Over the last two decades Viet Nam has made the transition from centrally planned to \nmarket-oriented  economy  with  unprecedented  success.  From  1993  to  2006,  poverty1 was \nreduced from 58.1% to 22.0%, gross domestic product (GDP) per capita increased from $288 to \n$722 in real terms, and economic output rose by an average of 7.5% annually. Between 2001 \nand 2006, domestic and international trade grew at an average annual rate of 17%, while \nforeign direct investment increased by 650%. The Government recognizes the private sector\u2019s \npivotal role in the economy, since the private sector generated almost 90% of the 7.5 million \njobs created during the same period. \n3.  The  rapid  urbanization  of  Viet  Nam  is  a  reflection  of  the  country's  economic \ndevelopment. The urban growth rate has averaged 4.9% per annum over the last decade; about \n20 million (23%) of the current population of 85 million now live in urban areas. By 2020, the \nurban component of the population is expected to nearly double to 40% as the population swells \nto a projected 104 million. The most rapid changes are occurring in the two largest and most \ndynamic cities\u2014Ho Chi Minh City (5.2 million people) and Ha Noi (3.4 million people). The next \ntiers of secondary cities have achieved much slower growth rates. As a result, these major cities \nare becoming more congested due to in-migration and are facing increasingly serious social and \nenvironmental problems, such as chaotic spatial development and land speculation. Meanwhile, \nsecondary cities that are located beyond the political and economic sphere of the large cities \nare  stagnating.  If  the  neglect  of  secondary  city  development  continues,  the  spatial  and \neconomic disparities will further constrain not only urban development, but also the economic \ndevelopment of Viet Nam as a whole. \n4.  The Government, through its Socio-Economic Development Plan (SEDP 2006\u20132010), \nplans to develop urban areas as growth centers and modernize urban infrastructure to attract \ninvestment, improve living standards, reduce urban-rural disparities, and ensure sustainable \ndevelopment. Another plan, the Orientation Plan for Urban Development to 2020, also aims to \npromote the development of small- and medium-sized cities and reduce gaps between urban \nand rural areas. Similarly, separate orientation plans for water supply, urban drainage, and solid \nwaste management and industrial waste aim to upgrade and expand, by 2020, a water supply \nsystem to ensure 100% coverage; drainage and sewerage systems to ensure 80% coverage; \non-site treatment for toxic waste for enterprises; and collection systems for solid and liquid \nwastes that can collect and dispose of at least 95% of urban and industrial wastes. \n5.  In parallel, ADB\u2019s country strategy for Viet Nam\u2019s urban sector emphasizes targeted \ninfrastructure investments in small- and medium-sized towns in the central region and along \neconomic corridors, with the objective of reducing migration to the large metropolitan cities. This \nwill require large investments in infrastructure; decentralized and improved urban governance; \n                                                 \n1  Poverty is based on the data obtained from the Ministry of Labor, Invalids, and Social Affairs. 2005. ", "2 \nadequate cost recovery of urban services; improved human resource capacity; promotion of \nbroad-based  participation  from  the  private  sector  and  community  groups;  and  inclusive \ndevelopment measures that take into account vulnerable groups, ethnic minorities, and women. \n6.  The main challenges facing secondary cities arise from a lack of urban infrastructure \ninvestments and the limited ability of local governments to provide reliable and affordable urban \nservices. Missing links in the road network, obsolete water supply pipes and high water losses, \nflooding and clogged drains, and disposal of untreated waste constrain the productive capacity \nof secondary cities and make these cities less competitive and livable. The lack of infrastructure \nand limited capacity to manage urban services further discourages external investments that are \ncritical to economic development and growth. To date, the Government has targeted 11 class II \nsecondary cities2 that have been promoted as target cities for development to limit growth in \nHanoi and Ho Chi Minh City. ADB is, therefore, targeting its assistance at this class II group. \nAssistance will include investments to upgrade and expand urban infrastructure, and \u201csoft\u201d \ninvestments in capacity building, institutional reform, and participatory development. ADB will \ncollaborate with development partners and the private sector. \n7.  Thanh Hoa City (Thanh Hoa), the capital of Thanh Hoa Province (THP), has been \nselected for ADB assistance based on several criteria: (i) urban population growth\u2014the city has \na population of 200,000 and aims to become a class I3 city by 2015 through natural population \nincrease, in-migration, and the expansion of the city boundary to 150 km2; (ii) high poverty \nlevels\u2014the city and the province have relatively high poverty levels;4 (iii) economic development \npotential\u2014the city has high industrial development and tourism potential because of its wealth \nof natural resources and strong cultural heritage; (iv) infrastructure needs\u2014the city requires \nmassive infrastructure investments in order to fully benefit from the major changes that will \noccur over the next 15 years in the region;5 and (v) special features that could potentially be \ndeveloped (e.g., tourism, cultural heritage, sustainable industrial development, environmental \nfeatures).  If  the  Project  is  successful,  it  can  serve  as  a  model  for  future  comprehensive \nsocioeconomic urban development projects that involves simultaneous investments in various \nsectors. An urban sector analysis of Thanh Hoa is in Appendix 2. A detailed project context and \ndescription is in Supplementary Appendix A. \n8.  Thanh Hoa\u2019s boundless potential is not matched by the quantity and productivity of its \nlabor  force.  Although  there  is  near-universal  enrollment  in  secondary  education,  tertiary \neducation enrollment remains low and the level of vocational training is not commensurate with \n                                                 \n2  Cities  with  a  population  of  over  250,000,  with  the  following  administrative  responsibilities:  preparing  their \nsocioeconomic and physical plans, preparing the local budget, allocating and leasing land to households and \nindividuals, issuing land-use certificates, managing handicraft villages, regulating local construction, managing \ninternal road networks and social infrastructure, and approving investment projects using the state capital budget \nallocated by the provincial authorities. The class II secondary cities are Bien Hoa, Buon Ma Thuot, Can Tho, Ha \nLong, Hoa Binh, Nam Dinh, Nha Trang, Thai Nguyen, Thanh Hoa, Vinh, and Vung Tau. \n3  Class I cities have populations of more than 500,000 and the following added administrative responsibilities: \nplanning and managing infrastructure investment; preparing and managing the implementation of land-use plans; \nmanaging small and medium-sized state-owned enterprises; overseeing the construction and operationalization of \nindustrial  or  processing  zones;  planning  and  managing  infrastructure  development  (local  transport  system, \nhighways, water supply, drainage, and sewerage systems); managing high schools, vocational schools, clinics, and \nheritage sites; approving state investment projects; licensing foreign investment projects; allocating and leasing \nlands to organizations and foreigners; registering non-state enterprises; and approving and managing housing \ndevelopment and state-owned stocks. The class I cities are Hai Phong, Da Nang, and Hue. \n4  Thanh Hoa is the second poorest province with a GDP per capita of half of the country\u2019s GDP per capita of $622. \nDespite  the  country\u2019s  7.5%  economic  growth  and  trade  performance  (600%  growth  from  1995\u20132005),  the \nunemployment and poverty levels are well above the national average. \n5  This include, among others, the construction of the new north-south expressway; development of Road 217, a \nsegment of the international road connecting Thanh Hoa with the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic; and coastal \nRoad 10 to Hai Phong, northern Viet Nam\u2019s major port. \n ", "33 \nthe demands and the needs of the manufacturing and tourism industries, which are potential \ndrivers of economic growth. These factors, along with a poor regulatory framework, constrain \npotential outside investment. \n9.  Despite having recently completed its city master plan, Thanh Hoa has no indication of \nhow the master plan will be implemented, where funding sources and implementation for capital \nexpenditures,  and  operation  and  maintenance  will  be  sought,  or  which  agency  will  be \nresponsible for implementing the master plan. There is an urgent need for Thanh Hoa to launch \na preliminary development plan as the prelude to its overall socioeconomic development plan, \nwhich  will  require  massive  external  investments.  Any  development  intervention  should, \ntherefore, be comprehensive and multisectoral, and should target priority sectors to create a \nsuitable and sustainable urban environment for Thanh Hoa in its role as a provincial capital and \nregional hub of north-central Viet Nam. \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n10.  Thanh Hoa aims to become a regional hub and service center for new investments in the \nprovince, with the goal of achieving class I status by 2015. To achieve these goals, Thanh Hoa \nneeds to capitalize on its strengths, overcome its weaknesses, and minimize threats to its \ndevelopment. During project preparation, the project preparatory technical assistance (PPTA) \nconsultant indicated that Thanh Hoa\u2019s key competitive advantages are its location along main \ntransportation  routes,  its  capacity  to  expand  spatially,  and  its  proximity  to  economically \ndeveloping areas such as Bim Son, Nghi Son, and Sam Son, natural resources (for mining), and \nnatural landscapes (for tourism). Thanh Hoa\u2019s best development opportunities lie in the areas of \ntourism (cultural heritage and natural resources) and industry. Its weaknesses are poor urban \ninfrastructure, unfavorable demographic and labor conditions (out-migration, low productivity, \nlow  skills,  and  skills  mismatch),  and  weak  human  resource  capacity.  The  main  threat  is \ncompetition from fellow provincial capitals Ninh Binh and Vinh for the status of North Central \nViet Nam's main regional hub. These cities, which are the capitals of Thanh Hoa\u2019s neighboring \nprovinces Ninh Binh and Nghe An, could potentially replace Thanh Hoa as the primary service \ncenter for THP. \n11.  Spatial  Location  and  Linkages.  Lying  150  km  south  of  Ha  Noi,  Thanh  Hoa  is \naccessible to Ha Noi, yet far enough away to ensure its own local economic development. It is \nlocated  along  major  transportation  networks  and  is  within  easy  reach  of  the  industrial \ndevelopment town of Bim Son (15 km to the north), the tourist town of Sam Son (16 km to the \neast), and the special industrial zone of Nghi Son (60 km to the south). The city center needs \nupgrading, particularly the central business area where the National Highway A1 intersects Le \nLoi Avenue. The construction of a new bridge crossing the Ma River is another pressing need. \nThe outlying peri-urban areas have economic potential, yet are not well-utilized because they \nare poorly linked to the city center. For example, urban villages in the southwest of Thanh Hoa \nare engaged in stone processing, handicraft making, and bronze-drum making. Tourism sites \n(Ham Rong and Mat Son), small and medium-sized enterprises, and historic sites (such as the \n2,500-year-old Dong Son archaeological site) are scattered and are not spatially integrated with \nthe urban core. Thanh Hoa\u2019s future development needs to progressively reach these urban \nvillages, toward the east and south to expand over about 150 km2, with a future population of \n500,000.  \n12.  Key Economic Sectors: Industrial Development and Tourism. Thanh Hoa\u2019s main \nareas of potential economic development are industry and tourism. In addition to the existing \nindustrial zones of Le Mon, Tay Bac Ga, and Dinh Huong, which are located within the city \nboundaries, the main industries are extractive mining (stone, marble, kaolin, cement) and basic \nprocessing industries (especially seafood). These industries have absorbed some of the local \n ", "4 \nlabor. However, graduates of local vocational schools are not well-equipped to respond to the \ndemands of these industries. New industrial zones have been planned in Hoang Hoa district to \nthe north and Quang Xuong district in the south to further capitalize on the availability of natural \nresources. The tourism sites of Ham Rong (ecotourism and limestone scenery), Dong Son \n(archaeology), and Mat Son (handicraft and stone villages) suffer from poor access and limited \nor no tourism amenities. These sites are largely untouched, although private companies have \nexpressed interest in developing them. In addition, Sam Son, a tourist resort town 16 km east of \nThanh Hoa, and Hoang Hoa beach to the north are within close reach of Ha Noi, but receive \ntourists only during 3 months of the year. THP and Thanh Hoa have not been able to develop \nsynergies to capitalize on the potential of these sites because of the interrelated issues of major \ninfrastructure gaps, limited human resource capacity, and a poor regulatory framework. \n \n13.  Urban  Infrastructure  Conditions.  Despite  recent  investments,  the  existing  urban \ninfrastructure is obsolete and deteriorating, particularly urban roads, water supply, solid waste \nand drainage, and wastewater treatment. \n14.  Roads. The main thoroughfares of Le Loi Avenue and National Road 1A and their \nsurrounding  arteries  have  just  been  upgraded  and  are  in  good  condition.  However,  most \nsecondary and tertiary roads leading from the city center to peri-urban areas have deteriorated \nand are subject to floods. Travel time to the city center can take one hour or more. There are \ncurrently 84 km of roads in Thanh Hoa. Urgent priorities for Thanh Hoa include the completion \nof a ring road around Thanh Hoa to divert traffic from overused National Road 1A and Le Loi \nAvenue; completion of various missing links in the road network including links to secondary \nroads and links to access roads to handicraft villages and tourism sites; and ensuring proper \noperation and maintenance of the road surface.  \n15.  Water  Supply.  Piped  water  supply  coverage  is  about  60%,  while  the  remaining \npopulation uses shallow wells; nonrevenue water is about 36%. Thanh Hoa has a 24-hour \nuninterrupted water supply and daily consumption is 90 liters per capita per day (lcd) in the \nurban area and 70 lcd in peri-urban areas. The average daily water demand is about 45,000 m3 \nper day while current production is 30,000 m3 per day, serving Thanh Hoa, Sam Son, and five \nother  townships.  By  improving  the  piped  water  network  (replacing  pipes,  repairing  leaks, \nreducing nonrevenue water), as well as the management efficiencies of the Thanh Hoa Water \nSupply Company (THWSC), more Thanh Hoa residents will be able to access reliable piped \nwater. \n16.  Drainage and Sewerage. Drainage is problematic as Thanh Hoa\u2019s topography is flat \nand up to one-third of the city is flooded during the rainy season. The partially completed \ndrainage system cannot prevent frequent flash floods. There is no wastewater treatment in \nThanh Hoa. The absence of an adequate wastewater collection system leads people to dispose \nwastewater directly into canals and waterways, creating pollution and public health hazards. \nThere is a need to upgrade Thanh Hoa\u2019s drainage system as well as treat the wastewater \nbefore  disposal.  The  Project  will  improve  the  management  of  the  Urban  Environmental \nCompany (URENCO). \n17.  Out-Migration from Thanh Hoa Province and City. The current demographic trend \nindicates a shift in population growth and significant out-migration, both for THP and Thanh \nHoa. THP is one of the most densely populated provinces in Viet Nam. It is expected that within \nthe next 10 years there could be a labor surplus of 700,000 based on an annual growth rate of \n3.2%. On the other hand, Thanh Hoa, with a population of 200,000, has a growth rate of 1.9% \nper year, but still could lose over 70,000 people to migration. If this trend continues, out-\nmigration from THP will increase, but not necessarily to Thanh Hoa. Training the workforce in \n ", "55 \nthe right mix of skills based on the demands of key economic sectors will, therefore, be a \nchallenge to retaining a productive workforce. \n18.  A Low-Skilled Workforce and Capacity to Provide Urban Services. Currently, private \ninvestors are not investing in Thanh Hoa because of major infrastructure gaps and poor human \nresource capacity. Although Thanh Hoa has a near universal secondary-level graduation rate, \nonly 18% of the population has received any tertiary education or professional training. There \nare 6,000 students in THP, distributed over 15 continuing education centers, 20 vocational \ntraining institutions, and one university, Hong Duc. However, there is a gap between the skills \nsupplied  and  those  required,  particularly  in  the  areas  of  general  administration,  language, \ncommunications, and management skills to promote tourism and industrial development. In \norder to improve Thanh Hoa\u2019s competitiveness and reduce migration out of THP and Thanh \nHoa, the skills of the labor force must be improved through targeted investments in education \nand training.  \n19.  Institutional  Aspects  of  Urban  Infrastructure  Management  and  Provision.  The \ncauses of inefficient infrastructure are multifaceted but are rooted in the lack of a regulatory \nframework for infrastructure service provision. These include: (i) inadequate financing and cost \nrecovery  mechanisms  for  capital  and  operating  expenditures;  (ii)  existence  of  policy, \ninstitutional,  and  structural  bottlenecks  that  deter  private  investment  to  finance  urban \ninfrastructure; (iii) limited human resource capacity to plan, operate, and manage urban assets \nand provide urban services; and (iv) a lack of capacity to regulate the provision of infrastructure \nservices.  The  need  for  improved  capacity  will  not  only  be  addressed  within  THWSC  and \nURENCO, but also in line departments within the Thanh Hoa and THP people's committees. \n20.  Support for Urban Development. Official development assistance (ODA) has been \nimportant to developing Viet Nam\u2019s urban infrastructure. About $1.3 billion of ODA has been \ninvested in the country\u2019s urban sector since 1995; ADB has provided $427 million of that total. \nHowever, most of these investments have been directed to Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City and \ntheir  metropolitan  regions.  In  order  to  achieve  the  Government\u2019s  objective  of  developing \nsecondary cities, a more distributional allocation of investments must be made. Both THP and \nThanh  Hoa  are  managing  ODA  projects  (about  $200  million)  in  key  investment  areas  of \ninfrastructure, tourism, industrial development, and human resource development, such as the \nfuture industrial development of Nghi Son, the merging of Thanh Hoa and Sam Son, the tourism \ndevelopment of Hoang Hoa, the rehabilitation of Road 217 from Thanh Hoa to the Lao People\u2019s \nDemocratic Republic, and the proposed expressway from Ninh Binh to Thanh Hoa and Vinh. \nThese have gradually built capacity for project management. Appendix 3 provides a list of \nexternal assistance to Viet Nam in the urban sector. \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n21.  The Project\u2019s impact will be the sustained socioeconomic development of Thanh Hoa \nthat will directly benefit about 75,000 people in THP, and will indirectly benefit about 270,000 \npeople in Thanh Hoa and its suburbs. The intended outcome is a well-managed, livable, and \ncompetitive city by 2015. \nB.  Outputs \n22.  The proposed Project will comprise three main interrelated investments: (i) core urban \nenvironment  upgrading;  (ii)  integrated  peri-urban  development;  and  (iii)  investments  in  key \neconomic  sectors,  such  as  industry  and  tourism.  Core  urban  environment  upgrading \ninvestments will be targeted to solve the most pressing environmental problems and provide \n ", "6 \nurban  services  to  the  urban  center.  At  present  water  supply,  drainage,  and  wastewater \ncollection services in the urban center are inadequate, which is creating severe problems for the \nurban environment and public health despite previous investment projects to address these \nissues.6 The integrated peri-urban development component aims to boost the local economy by \nimproving links between the city center and peri-urban areas and sites such as handicraft \nvillages, other tourist areas, and training facilities. The construction of arterial and secondary \nroads to the peri-urban areas will be complemented by the provision of basic urban services \nsuch  as  water  supply,  drainage,  and  street  lighting.  Investments  in  human  resources  and \ntourism will improve the environment for private sector participation, create jobs, and improve \nskilled labor. \n23.  The expected outputs will be as follows:  \n(i)  Improved urban road network and basic urban services. The Project will \nimprove the urban road network and associated basic urban services through the \nconstruction of four bridges and 22 km of new and upgraded roads (comprising a \nnew 11 km ring road that relieves congestion in the city center and connects the \neast, south, and west parts of the city; and 11 km of secondary and access roads \nthat will link isolated peri-urban villages with the city center). In addition, box \nbeam bridges will be constructed to span the Le river. The road network will \ncontribute to the improvement of Thanh Hoa\u2019s tourism infrastructure by improving \ntransport links between tourist attractions and the city center. The road network \nwill also enable the city\u2019s planned expansion. The ring road will be provided with \nrelated complementary basic urban services such as water supply and drainage \n(which will be covered under [ii] and [iii]), as well as infrastructure to receive \npower and telecommunications grids. The upgraded secondary roads will also be \nprovided  with  water  pipes,  sewerage  and  drainage  channels,  culverts,  and \nstreetlights. The water supply pipes will be financed under (ii) and (iii). Given the \nimpacts that the road development component will have on poor households and \nwomen, community consultations on road construction will be given top priority \nand will be conducted at times conducive to women\u2019s participation. Bidding terms \nfor contractors will require engagement of both males and females.7 In order to \nreduce the risks of increased and disorderly traffic resulting from improved roads, \na public awareness program on the importance of traffic safety will be developed. \n(ii)  Expanded and upgraded water supply distribution network. The Project will \nexpand the water supply distribution network by (a) constructing 18.6 km of \nprimary and secondary water pipes to expand service to peri-urban areas, and \n(b) replacing 18.7 km of damaged primary and secondary pipes in the city center. \nAs per Decree 117/2007, THP has the authority to set water tariffs on a full cost \nrecovery  basis  plus  a  reasonable  profit.  The  Project  will  support  the \nimplementation of the institutional and policy reform agenda and action plan, \nfunded in parallel to the Project through a grant from the Cities Development \n                                                 \n6  An ongoing ADB-financed loan project (ADB. 2003. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of \nDirectors on a Proposed Loan to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for the Central Region Urban Environmental \nImprovement Project. Manila [Loan 2034-VIE, approved on 8 December]) has only been partially implemented and \nseveral  components  were  cancelled  due  to  major  increases  in  costs  since  approval;  only  the  secondary \nwastewater and drainage network will be built under the loan. The proposed Project will, therefore, complete this \ninvestment by financing the primary drainage and tertiary sewerage network and the renovation of the water supply \nnetwork. \n7  This will include provision of separate toilet facilities for men and women workers, a daycare facility for women \nworkers, and other measures. With regard to land acquisition consultations, both husband and wife will be required \nto sign acquisition agreements. \n ", "77 \nInitiative in Asia (CDIA) and to be followed by a grant from the Water Financing \nPartnership Facility (WFPF), managed by ADB. The reform agenda and capacity \nbuilding  will  include,  but  not  be  limited  to:  (a)  equitizing  (partly  privatizing) \nTHWSC; (b) strengthening the capacity of THWSC to improve its performance, \nprepare affordability guidelines, improve its administration and management as \nwell as develop specialized technical expertise such as the measures to recover \ncosts and reduce nonrevenue water; (c) undertaking a capacity building program \nfor  relevant  line  departments  of  THP  and  Thanh  Hoa  (management,  budget \nplanning,  and  asset  management),  as  clients  of  THWSC  and  to  facilitate  a \nconducive business climate for improved water supply service provision; and \n(d) improving community awareness and participation in the management and \nplanning of water supply services. \n(iii)  Improved  drainage  and  wastewater  treatment.  The  Project  will  improve \ndrainage and wastewater treatment. Key subprojects will include the construction \nof about 20 km of interceptors for sewerage and drainage in peri-urban areas; the \nupgrading of 27 km of interceptors for the city center; the construction of 13 \npumping  stations;  the  construction  of  a  wastewater  treatment  pond  with  a \ncapacity of 15,000 m3 per day; and the construction of three smaller wastewater \ntreatment facilities for the city general hospital. These subprojects will reduce \nflooding in the city and drastically cut down on the amount of pollution discharged \ninto  the  Ma  River.  This  component  will  also  support  the  updating  and \nimplementation of a detailed institutional and policy reform agenda and action \nplan, funded in parallel to the Project through CDIA and WFPF. The reform \nagenda and capacity building will include, but not be limited to: (a) corporatizing \nURENCO;  (b)  strengthening  the  capacity  of  URENCO  to  improve  its \nperformance,  prepare  affordability  guidelines,  improve  its  administration  and \nmanagement,  and  maintain  drainage  and  wastewater  treatment  facilities; \n(c) undertaking capacity building program for relevant line departments of THP \nand Thanh Hoa (management, budget planning, and asset management) as \nclients of URENCO and to improve the overall business climate for improved \ndrainage  and  wastewater  service  provision;  and  (d)  improving  community \nawareness and participation in the management and planning of drainage and \nwastewater  services.  The  component  will  develop  a  community  awareness \nstrategy  on  household  sanitation  and  on  the  health  benefits  of  connecting \nhousehold sewers to wastewater treatment.8 It will also develop partnerships to \nprovide low-cost solutions that will enable poor households to obtain piped water \nand  connect  to  sewer  systems.  With  improved  drainage  and  wastewater \ntreatment, it is expected that the incidence of waterborne diseases will decrease \nby about 50% by 2015. \n(iv)  Improved  human  resources  and  skills.  The  Project  will  improve  labor \nproductivity  and  address  the  shortage  of  skilled  labor  in  areas  targeted  for \ndevelopment such as tourism and industry. This will be achieved in part by \nupgrading  six  existing  vocational  training  centers,  which  will  benefit  from \nupgraded equipment and skills training for teachers. In addition, an action plan \nwill be launched to address skills shortages in key areas. To ensure that training \nis relevant to the needs of Thanh Hoa and THP, an advisory group\u2014including \n                                                 \n8  Activities financed in parallel to the Project through a grant from the ADB\u2019s Water Financing Partnership Facility, \nwill be carried out by Viet Nam Women\u2019s Union (VWU), which highlights the benefits of sanitation improvements on \nwomen\u2019s and family health. \n ", "8 \nrepresentatives of the private sector; industrial zones; vocational schools; the \nViet Nam Women\u2019s Union (VWU); and the Department of Labor, Invalids and \nSocial Affairs (DOLISA)\u2014will be formed under the provincial project management \nunit  (PPMU)  to  provide  feedback  on  the  design  and  implementation  of  this \ncomponent. The Project will also support the establishment of a one-stop-shop in \nthe  center  of  Thanh  Hoa  that  will  provide  job  seekers  with  information  on \nvacancies in the region, information on availability of courses to enhance their \nemployability, and CV preparation assistance. The center, which will be under \nDOLISA, will also organize annual job fairs. With such investment in human \ndevelopment, industrial productivity will increase by about 25% by 2015. As a \nresult, Thanh Hoa\u2019s employment and total economic output will also significantly \nincrease by 2020. The PPMU will establish baseline data on participation rates \nby gender,  the disabled, and ethnic minority  group. Student enrollment data \ndisaggregated by sex will be monitored during the life of the Project and included \nin  the evaluation  framework.  The  design  briefs  for  new  school  buildings  will \ninclude separate male and female toilet facilities and access for people with \ndisabilities. \n(v)  Well-managed  tourism  development.  The  Project  will  promote  ecotourism, \ncultural heritage tourism, and recreational activities, and will protect the natural \nenvironment through infrastructure improvements, restoration projects, facilities \ndevelopment, and service improvements. Specifically, this component will (a) \nimprove the infrastructure of the 2,000 m2 Thanh Hoa Museum; (b) upgrade the \nHam Rong ecotourism area, which lies to the north of Thanh Hoa and features \nscenic limestone hills and cultural heritage sites (such as temples and pagodas); \naccess roads, a welcome center, and other tourism amenities will be built and/or \nupgraded, and a 60-hectare (ha) botanical park will be created; (c) restore the \nworld-renowned Dong Son archaeological site, which contains artifacts dating \nback 2,500 years; both the site itself and the surrounding village will be restored; \nand  (d)  upgrade  Mat Son,  a  collection  of  villages specializing  in  stoneware, \nbronze, and various handicrafts, and beautify the nearby Le river. In addition to \nimproving spatial links among these sites, this component will create synergies \nbetween  tourism  and  handicraft  production,  urban  development,  industrial \ngrowth, and labor training. This component will also address the issue of tourism \nmanagement,  and  will  encourage  the  government  to  focus  on  regulatory \noversight and facilitation of private investments in tourism facilities. It is expected \nthat by 2015 the number of tourist arrivals to Thanh Hoa will increase by 50%. \nThe Project will also support that small businesses oriented toward tourism, \navailable  credit  facilities,  and  training  opportunities  are  accessed  by  equal \nnumbers of women and men near project-targeted tourist sites. \nC.  Special Features \n24.  Integrated Planning and Design. The Project seeks to integrate spatial and functional \nlinks, which will comprise targeted investments in infrastructure (urban roads, water supply, \ndrainage, and wastewater treatment), human resource development, and institutional reform to \nenable Thanh Hoa to develop tourism and industry, as its key economic sectors. It will link three \nbroad  investments  comprising  core  urban  environment  upgrading,  integrated  peri-urban \ndevelopment, and investments in key economic sectors, while addressing infrastructure gaps \nand institutional bottlenecks. The proposed Project will finance an initial work program under the \nMaster Plan, building on existing infrastructure and competitive advantages to jumpstart Thanh \nHoa\u2019s economic development. The integration of various project components will result in an \n ", "99 \noverall benefit greater than the sum of the benefits derived from each individual component. \nThis integration will promote sustainable development in the project area and help achieve the \nproject objective of transforming Thanh Hoa into a competitive and livable city. The Project's \nsecondary-city development model, if successful, could be replicated elsewhere in Viet Nam \nand the Greater Mekong Subregion. The introduction of aesthetic urban design elements such \nas sidewalks, street lighting, benches, and other street furniture that reflect its rich cultural \nheritages  are  essential  to  creating  an  \u201cimage\u201d  of  Thanh  Hoa,  which  has  a  huge  tourism \npotential. The City Development Strategy for Thanh Hoa in a Regional Context,9 a complementary \nstudy to be implemented by UN-Habitat and ADB, in parallel to the project will emphasize Thanh \nHoa's role within the regional \"growth triangle\" that includes Xam Neua in the Lao People\u2019s \nDemocratic Republic to the west, Vinh to the south, and Hanoi to the north. The study will define \nthe roles of the public and private sectors, as well as civil society in supporting a long-term \nvision for the development of the city. It will also identify infrastructure gaps and institutional \nbottlenecks that need to be overcome and review and update of the City Master Plan. \n25.  Combined  Investments  to  Stimulate  City  Development.  The  Project  will  enable \nsimultaneous investments in Thanh Hoa\u2019s key economic sectors, not only by ADB but also by \nother development partners. These simultaneous investments will move the local economy \nforward and should lead to additional investments down the road. Cofinancing is sought from \nthe Government of the Republic of Korea, through Korea Exim Bank, to finance the entire urban \nroad  development  component.  Parallel  to  the  Project,  four  grants  will  be  administered \nseparately, but are conceptually linked to enhance the Project\u2019s objectives: (i) the Japan Fund \nfor Poverty Reduction grant10 for small-scale infrastructure investments and services in the peri-\nurban areas of the city specifically targeting the urban poor and promoting community-based \norganizations; (ii) a grant11 from the Public Private Advisory Facility, which will finance the \nestablishment of a provincial investment fund and its business and operation plan to leverage \npublic  funding  with  private  sector  investment  in  the  form  of  public-private  partnerships  in \ninfrastructure; (iii) a Cities Development Initiative in Asia (CDIA) grant12 that will prepare project \ncomponents in water supply and sanitation for Thanh Hoa and Sam Son, to be financed through \nthe newly established provincial investment fund; and (iv) a grant13 from the WFPF, which will \nassist in the institutional strengthening and capacity building of THWSC and URENCO; the \nProject will develop an action plan containing the proposed phasing of activities, timetable, \ninputs, and performance indicators to improve the sustainability of THWSC and URENCO, \nexpand their coverage, and reduce their operating costs. In addition, capacity building programs \nwill be developed for the line departments of THP and Thanh Hoa that are engaged in the \nprovision of urban services. \n26.  Reform for Improved Urban Services. The low capacity of utilities companies and \ngovernment agencies to deliver and provide affordable and sustainable services necessitates \nfurther  action  to  implement  existing  legislation  and  introduce  policy  reforms  to  restructure \nmanagement,  build  capacity,  improve  cash  flow,  and  remove  institutional  bottlenecks  that \nimpede private sector participation. A major thrust of the reform process is the equitization of \nTHWSC and the corporatization of URENCO. For THWSC, water tariff adjustments will be \n                                                 \n9  Draft application to be submitted for funding through the Cities Alliance, in Supplementary Appendix B, due for \napproval in 2009. \n10 ADB, 2008.

The institutional and \nreform agenda is in Appendix 4. \n27.  Decentralized Administration. This will be the first project to be delegated from the \ncentral Government to the provincial people\u2019s committee.14 This delegation aims to improve \nproject design and implementation through the decentralization of administration and approval \nprocesses.  This  will  also  bring  greater  project  ownership  to  provincial-  and  city-level \nstakeholders and improve responsiveness to beneficiary needs. However, there is also an \ninherent  risk  that  the  technical  capacity  of  provincial  people\u2019s  committee  as  the  reviewing \nagency will be limited. Therefore, monitoring indicators and close monitoring by ADB during \nimplementation must be strengthened. \nD.  Project Investment Plan \n28.  The project investment cost is estimated at $117.9 million, including taxes and duties of \n$9.4 million. The total cost includes physical and price contingencies, and interest and other \ncharges during implementation. \nTable 1: Project Investment Plan \n($ million) \nItem     Amounts \nA.

Financing Plan \n29.  The Government has requested (i) a loan of $72.0 million from ADB\u2019s Special Funds \nresources to finance a portion of the project cost, including land acquisition and resettlement \nimplementation, project incremental costs, and consulting services for components 2\u20135. The \nloan will have a 32-year term, including a grace period of 8 years, and an interest rate of 1.0% \n                                                 \n14 Based on Decree 131/2006/ND-CP on the delegated management of projects financed by official development \nassistance and Decision No. 48/2008/QD-TTg, using the new format for the feasibility study and investment report. \n ", "1111 \nduring the grace period and 1.5% thereafter, and (ii) a grant of $2.0 million from the WFPF15 to \nfinance capacity building of THWSC and URENCO to provide affordable and sustainable water \nsupply  and  sanitation  services  to  the  residents  of  Thanh  Hoa  City.  The  ADB  financing \nrepresents 61% of the total project cost. The Government has also requested a loan of up to \n$33.0 million from the Government of the Republic of Korea. The loan will have a 35-year \nmaturity with a 10-year grace period and a fixed interest rate of 0% for the tied consulting \nservices and 0.5% for the untied investment. This loan would finance in parallel financing to \nADB loan, the urban road development component (component 1) and consulting services for \ndetailed design, procurement support, and construction supervision of component 1. \n30.  The remaining cost, about $11.2 million equivalent, will be financed by the Government. \nCounterpart funds will cover taxes and duties. All of the loans to the Government will be either \nrelent or on-granted to the THP People's Committee, according to Decree QD 181 TTg. For \nnonrevenue generating components (road development, drainage, human resource development, \nand tourism), the mechanism will be through a budgetary transfer. For the revenue generating \ncomponent (water supply), a subsidiary loan agreement will be made between the Government \n(i.e., the Ministry of Finance) and the borrowing entity (THWSC). A table of project cost estimates \nand the financing plan are in Appendix 5. A detailed project cost table is in Supplementary \nAppendix E. The summary tentative financing plan is presented in Table 2 below: \nTable 2: Tentative Financing Plan \n($ million) \nSource  Total  % \nAsian Development Banka  72.0  61.1\nMulti-Donor Trust Fund from Water Financing Partnership Facilityb  1.2  1.0\nNetherlands Trust Fund from Water Financing Partnership Facilityb  0.8  0.7\nGovernment of the Republic of Korea  32.7  27.7\nGovernment of Viet Nam  11.2  9.5\n  Total    117.9  100.0\na  SDR48,321,000 is currently equivalent to $72.0 million. \nb   Administered by ADB. \nSource: Project preparatory technical assistance consultant. \n \nF.  Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Project Management \n31.  The Executing Agency will be THP People\u2019s Committee, which will be responsible for \noverall project supervision and guidance. Implementation will be delegated to a PPMU, which \nwill be established within 1 month of loan effectiveness, and will be headed by a project director \nand assisted by three deputy project directors, one in charge of finance and administration, \nanother in charge of technical and procurement matters, and the third in charge of monitoring, \nevaluation,  and  safeguard  compliance.  The  PPMU  will  be  responsible  for  engaging  and \nsupervising the work of all consultants, and coordination of all aspects of the project works with \nthe central and local governments and development partners such as ADB and the Government \nof the Republic of Korea. In order to secure timely mobilization of the consulting services, an \nindividual consultant financed through the PPTA is already finalizing the terms of reference, \nrequests for proposals, and bid evaluation reports for all consulting services (financed through \nboth ADB and the Republic of Korea). Each project component will be delegated to a project \n                                                 \n15 The WFPF grant of $2.0 million will comprise $1.2 million from the Multi-Donor Trust Fund and $0.8 million from the \nNetherlands Trust Fund.  \n ", "12 \nimplementation unit (PIU), which will be integrated in existing management structures. Each PIU \nwill be responsible for managing implementation and coordination for its respective project \ncomponent. Liaison and coordination with the community will be done through the Commune \nManagement Council (CMC). The CMC will deal with the implementation of the resettlement \nplan, initial environmental examination, gender action plan, and resolution of related issues at \nthe community level. Detailed implementation arrangements are in Supplementary Appendix F. \n32.  A project steering committee (PSC) will be established by the Executing Agency and will \nmeet at least four times a year to assess the project implementation status. Membership to this \ncommittee will include representatives of THP, Thanh Hoa, ADB, and the Government of the \nRepublic of Korea.  \n2.  Implementation Schedule \n33.  The  Project  will  be  implemented  from  April  2009  to  June  2014.  The  above  period \nassumes that construction work on the first package will commence in 2010. Six months is \nallowed to complete all construction work and finalize payments. Timely recruitment of the \nconsultants will be critical to keep the implementation schedule and commencing civil works by \n2010. The implementation schedule for the Project is in Appendix 6. \n3.  Procurement \n34.  All  contracts  procured  under  the  ADB  loan  with  international  competitive  bidding \nprocedures and for consulting services will be subject to prior review by ADB. Documentation \nfor  the  first  contract  procured  under  national  competitive  bidding  (NCB)  and  under  limited \ninternational bidding will be subject to prior review by ADB; thereafter, post-review will be \nrequired unless otherwise agreed, as per the procurement plan. All procurement to be financed \nunder the ADB loan will be carried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, \nas amended from time to time). The civil works to be funded from the ADB loan will be procured \nthrough  (i)  international  competitive  bidding  (ICB)  procedures  for  contracts  exceeding \n$2.0  million, and (ii) NCB procedures for contract of less than $2.0 million. The equipment to be \nfunded from the ADB loan will be procured through (i) ICB procedures for contracts exceeding \n$500,000;  (ii)  limited  international  bidding  and  shopping  procedures  for  contracts  between \n$100,000 and $500,000; and (iii) shopping procedures for contracts of less than $100,000. At \nthe  request  of  the  Executing  Agency,  domestic  preference  for  contracts  bid  under  ICB \nprocedures will be applied. Procurement under the Government of the Republic of Korea loan \nwill be untied. Using the engineering-procurement-construction method,16 it is anticipated that \nforce account will be employed when the small size and location of the works make competitive \nbidding less attractive. Among the works that might fall into this category are village access \nroads, minor irrigation and drainage works, and other small and remote scattered works. Force \naccount will also be used in other special cases where local contractors do not express interest \nin undertaking the works or where force account can be demonstrated to be the most efficient \nand effective method of implementation. A procurement plan is included in Appendix 7. \n4.  Consulting Services \n35.  The consulting services to be funded under the Project will be undertaken through five \ncontracts. The urban road development component (component 1) will be funded from the \nGovernment of the Republic of Korea loan. It will be funded on a tied basis and will be sourced \nfrom the Republic of Korea for the foreign portion and from Viet Nam for the local portion of the \nfinancing. The Korean and Vietnamese consultants will be selected according to the guidelines \nfor the employment of consultants under the Government of the Republic of Korea\u2019s Economic \n                                                 \n16 As defined as per Vietnamese Bidding Law No.61/2005/QH11.  \n ", "1313 \nDevelopment  Cooperation  Fund.17 Consultancy  for  components  2\u20135,  which  cover  design, \nbidding, and construction supervision, will be funded from the ADB loan using the quality- and \ncost-based selection (QCBS) procedure. The ADB loan will also fund the engagement of one \nnational  consultant,  recruited  as  an  individual  consultant,  to  independently  carry  out \nresettlement  monitoring,  and  one  international  independent  auditing  firm  using  least-cost \nselection. The capacity building grant will be allocated to a firm selected using QCBS procedure \nand simplified technical proposal and individual consultants. All ADB-funded procurement for \nconsulting  services  will  be  made  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants (2007, as amended from time to time). Under QCBS, the technical proposals will be \ngiven a weight of 80% and the financial proposals will be given a weight of 20%. An outline of \nthe consultants\u2019 terms of reference is in Appendix 8. \n5.  Anticorruption Policy \n36.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained and discussed \nwith  the  THP  People\u2019s  Committee.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance, \naccountability, and transparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its \nagents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the Project. \nTo support these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB's Anti-Corruption Policy are included in the \nloan regulations and the bidding documents for the Project. In particular, all contracts financed \nby ADB in connection with the Project shall include provisions specifying the right of ADB to \naudit and examine the records and accounts of the Executing Agency and all contractors, \nsuppliers, consultants, and other service providers as they relate to the Project. \n37.  To ensure transparency and good governance, the PPMU will publicly disclose on its \nwebsite information on how loan proceeds are being used. For each procurement contract the \nPPMU will disclose (i) the list of participating bidders, (ii) the name of the winning bidder, (iii) basic \ndetails on bidding procedures adopted, (iv) the amount of the contract awarded, (v) a list of goods \nand/or services purchased, and (vi) intended and actual utilization of loan proceeds under each \ncontract. The PPMU will also disclose details of resettlement reports on its or the Executing \nAgency's website. The website will be updated within 2 weeks of each contract being awarded. \n6.  Disbursement Arrangements \n38.  Loan disbursement will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook \n(2007, as amended from time to time) and detailed arrangements agreed upon between the \nGovernment  and  ADB.  Loan  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  directly  to  the  contractors  and \nconsultants, based on an approved contract using direct payment procedures. Payments for \nPPMU incremental administration costs will be made from an imprest account, managed and \nadministered by the PPMU, held at a commercial bank acceptable to the Government and ADB. \nThe initial deposit to the imprest account will be based on estimated expenditures, to be funded \nfrom the imprest account, for the first 6 months of the project implementation or $5 million, \nwhichever is lower. Five second-generation imprest accounts (SGIAs) will be established in the \n(i)  four  PIUs  for  components  2\u20135  for  use  in  the  payment  of  expenses  arising  from \nimplementation by PIUs for their incremental costs and related expenses, and (ii) resettlement \ncommittee for use in the payment of land acquisition and resettlement costs.18 The initial deposit \nto an SGIA will be based on estimated expenditures, to be funded through the SGIA, for the first \n                                                 \n17 The guidelines require advertisement to receive expression of interest and a short list of three to five consulting \nfirms. \n18 Since the ADB loan will finance land acquisition and resettlement costs, detailed arrangements will be made during \nthe setting-up of the PPMU to ensure that the disbursement of funds is done transparently, efficiently, and \neffectively to avoid the misuse of funds and to ensure that the funds will reach those from whom the land or right-\nof-way is purchased in full. \n ", "14 \n6 months of project implementation, or $0.5 million, whichever is lower. The statement of \nexpenditure procedure will be used to reimburse eligible expenditures and liquidate advances to \nthe imprest account to facilitate project implementation. The ceiling for each payment under the \nstatement of expenditure procedure is $100,000. Within 1 month of loan effectiveness, the \nPPMU  will  be  required  to  submit  for  ADB  approval  all  of  the  proposed  staffing,  financial \nmanagement systems, and procedures for the imprest account and the five SGIAs. \n7.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n39.  The PPMU shall maintain separate records and accounts adequate to identify the goods \nand services financed from the proceeds of the project loan, financing resources received, \nexpenditures incurred for the Project, an audit of resettlement expenditures, and use of local \nfunds. Within 6 months of the close of the year, the PPMU will submit an audited annual project \naccount to ADB that will provide a detailed description of the source of funds and expenditures \nmade.19 The annual project account will be audited by an auditor acceptable to ADB, and the \nauditor\u2019s terms of reference will be approved by ADB before commencement of work. The \nannual audit will include an audit opinion on the imprest account, SGIAs, and statement of \nexpenditures procedure operations. The audit results will be submitted to ADB annually. \n40.  Semiannual  progress  reports  on  the  Project  will  be  prepared  by  the  design  and \nconstruction supervision consultants, and reviewed by the PPMU for further submission to ADB \nwith copy to the Executing Agency. Progress reports will include a description of the physical \nprogress, status of implementation of resettlement, gender, and environmental management \nplans,  as  well  as  the  status  of  procurement,  disbursements,  and  highlights  of  other \nimplementation issues. The progress reports will also contain a summary and evaluation of \nproject accounts, including details of the latest project expenditures, contract amounts, and \nother uses of loan proceeds. \n8.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n41.  The PPMU will submit semiannual progress reports to ADB and conduct timely baseline \nphysical  and  socioeconomic  surveys.  Data  on  the  relevant  indicators  for  monitoring  and \nreporting purposes will be collected, analyzed, and compared against the targets achieved \nduring project completion. Performance indicators will include but not be limited to (i) urban \ninfrastructure service coverage; (ii) road length and traffic conditions for roads; (iii) unaccounted-\nfor water, production capacity, O&M costs, and billing and collection efficiency for water supply; \n(iv) incidence and reduction of flooding, drainage, and wastewater treatment capacity; (v) tourist \narrivals and revenue generated; and (vi) labor output and productivity. Semiannual progress \nreports will describe physical progress, details of any change in schedule, implementation \nprogress against the gender action plan, updates on implementation of the environmental, \nresettlement, and gender action plans, use of loan proceeds, and an outline of the work for the \nnext 6 months. The report will provide summary financial accounts of the Project, including \nexpenditures during the period, year-to-date expenditures, and total expenditures to date. The \nPPMU will submit to ADB, within 3 months of physical project completion, a project completion \nreport  covering  the  details  of  implementation,  costs,  monitoring  and  evaluation,  and  other \ninformation requested by ADB. A post-resettlement evaluation by an independent consultant will \nbe undertaken once all project resettlement activities have been completed. The indicators to be \nmonitored  will  be  formulated,  discussed,  and  agreed  upon  by  ADB,  the  THP  People's \nCommittee, and the Thanh Hoa People's Committee. \n \n                                                 \n19 A separate audit opinion is to be issued for the use of the (i) imprest account and second generation imprest \naccounts, and (ii) SOE procedures. \n ", "1515 \n9.  Project Review \n42.  ADB, together with Government representatives and the cofinanciers, will undertake \nregular  reviews  of  the  Project  at  about  6-month  intervals.  At  critical  periods  during \nimplementation  of  the  resettlement  plans  and  environmental  management  plans,  ADB\u2019s \nresettlement and environment specialists will join the reviews. In addition to these regular \nreviews a comprehensive midterm review of project implementation will be carried out. This \nmidterm review will allow for any necessary midcourse corrections, such as the consideration to \nuse loan savings and remaining contingencies. About 1 year after project completion, a project \ncompletion review will document the achievements of the Project. \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \nA.  Social Aspects \n1.  Social and Poverty Impact \n43.  A social impact assessment was carried out based on ADB\u2019s Handbook on Social and \nPoverty Analysis (2001) to assess the socioeconomic profile of THP and Thanh Hoa, and the \nsocial dimensions of poverty; identify key issues and potential project impacts on women, the \npoor,  ethnic  minorities,  and  vulnerable  groups;  recommend  pro-poor  design  of  the  project \ncomponents; and suggest monitoring and evaluation indicators. The assessment highlighted \nthat the poverty rate20 in the urban wards was about 13.6%. In general, residents in peri-urban \nareas are poorer than residents in the urban core. The lack of infrastructure and basic services \nand marginalization (particularly in peri-urban areas with lack of transportation access to the \ncity) along with a lack of productivity, ill health, and low skills, were considered the main causes \nof poverty. It is expected that improved urban roads will provide greater access to residents in \nperi-urban areas and improve the flow of goods, services, and people. Safe and reliable piped \nwater will help lower water costs, save time, and improve health. Better drainage and solid \nwaste collection systems will help eliminate standing rain and storm water and cut down on the \nincidence of unsanitary solid and liquid wastes disposal. Tourism and business development will \nimprove the city\u2019s image and increase labor productivity, as well as attracting investments and \nrevenue. Promotion of hygiene awareness will complement the Project\u2019s physical investments \nand provide health benefits to infants, women, and the elderly, who are more susceptible to \nwaterborne disease and environment-related illness. The summary poverty reduction and social \nstrategy is in Appendix 9. \n \n2.  Gender Impact \n44.  A gender assessment was carried out to analyze the situation of women in the project \narea, their participation in the labor market (formal or informal), their access to basic social \nservices, the constraints on women\u2019s access to the urban labor market, and the potential for \ngrowing tourism, small and medium-sized business development, and investment in industry \nand trade to create more job opportunities for women. In accordance with Viet Nam\u2019s Law on \nGender Equality, effective July 2007, and the recent decree for the implementation of the Law on \nGender  Equality 21  project  interventions  will  contribute  to  promoting  gender  equality  and \nopportunities for women by mainstreaming gender-responsive strategies across all sectors of \nintervention. Capacity building to enable the stakeholder institutions to implement activities that \npromote equal opportunity and participation for women and men will be provided under the \nproject  gender  analysis  and  action  plan.  The  gender  analysis  and  action  plan,  which  is \n                                                 \n20 Based on the definition of poverty set forth by the Ministry of Labor, Invalids and Social Affairs, 2005. \n21 N70/2008/ND, endorsed by the National Assembly on 4 June 2008.  \n ", "16 \nincorporated in the social and gender analysis, is in Supplementary Appendix G. \n3.  Indigenous Peoples and Ethnic Minorities \n45.  A socioeconomic survey has determined that the majority of Thanh Hoa\u2019s population is \nKinh and that the non-Kinh population has long assimilated with the Kinh majority. Urban \ninfrastructure development is not expected to have any direct impact on ethnic minority groups. \nIf indigenous people turn out to be living in urban and peri-urban areas, any ethnic minority \nissues will be addressed according to ADB\u2019s Policy on Indigenous Peoples (1998). \n4.  Land Acquisition and Resettlement  \n46.  Based on the preliminary design, a survey and inventory of assets were carried out to \nidentify resettlement impacts. An estimated 49.4 ha of land will be permanently acquired by the \nProject. Most land slated for acquisition is agricultural land (48.1 ha) while the remainder is \nresidential land (0.4 ha) and government land (0.9 ha). A total of 726 households and eight \ninstitutions were identified as project affected persons. Of these, about 546 households will be \nseverely affected due to (i) loss of 10% or more of their productive assets such as paddy land \n(519 households); and (ii) relocation of houses (24 households). A full resettlement plan has \nbeen prepared with an estimated cost of $4.9 million. This covers compensation payment for \nland and non-land assets at replacement cost, allowance, relocation, and income restoration \nmeasures, administrative costs, and contingency costs. During detailed design, efforts will be \nmade to further avoid, or at least minimize, impacts through consultation with local authorities \nand affected persons. The resettlement plan will then be updated and disclosed to affected \npersons prior to submission to ADB for review and approval. The full resettlement plan is in \nSupplementary Appendix H. \nB.  Environmental Aspects \n47.  An  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE)  was  undertaken  according  to  ADB\u2019s \nEnvironment Policy (2002) and Environmental Assessment Guidelines (2003) to screen potential \nenvironmental impacts of the proposed investments, formulate mitigation measures, and propose \ninstitutional  arrangements.  The  IEE  report  indicates  that  the  environmental  impacts  of  the \nProject\u2019s components, as a whole, will not be significant. However, special measures will be \ntaken to ensure that restoration works at the Dong Son archaeological area do not damage any \ncultural, historical, or archaeological relics. In coordination with the Department of Culture and \nInformation, prevailing regulations will be enforced to account for any undiscovered items that \nmay be excavated during restoration and upgrading of this site. Mitigation measures for other \nproject interventions, such as construction and improvement of arterial and secondary roads, \nexpansion of water supply and drainage network, replacement of damaged water supply pipes, \nand construction of two wastewater plants, can be undertaken without difficulty through proper \nengineering  design,  incorporation  of  recommended  mitigation  measures,  and  community \nparticipation. For urban road development, the main concerns are noise and dust pollution \nduring construction. These impacts are short-term and will be minimized by proposed mitigation \nmeasures and good engineering and construction practices, as well as through the involvement \nof communities and other stakeholders in project planning, design, and implementation. For \nwastewater treatment, the environmental concerns are odor and pollution of water bodies from \nthe wastewater stabilization ponds. The inlet works will be covered with removable covers to \nminimize odors. In the construction phase, social issues related to land acquisition, compensation, \nand resettlement will be addressed through the implementation of a resettlement plan. \n48.  During the detailed design phase, an environmental management plan (EMP) for each \nproject component shall be prepared based on the detailed design and the proposed mitigation \nmeasures and implementation arrangements outlined in the IEE. The detailed EMP shall cover \n ", "1717 \nthe  pre-construction,  construction,  and  operation  stages  of  each  project  component.  EMP \nprovisions  shall  be  described  in  the  bidding  documents  and  contracts.  An  environmental \nmanagement unit will be set up within the PPMU to be responsible for implementation of \nenvironmental mitigation measures and monitoring. Each project component will be delegated \nto  a  project  implementation  unit  (PIU),  which  will  each  have  a  designated  environment \nspecialist.  The  monitoring  of  environmental  performance  of  contractors  and  preparation  of \ncorresponding monitoring reports shall be undertaken by the construction supervision consultant \nin coordination with the PPMU's environmental management unit and PIU. The PPMU and PIU \nwill collaborate with the Environmental Monitoring and Protection Center (within the Department \nof Natural Resources and Environment), the Department of Science and Technology, and the \nDepartment of Health to test water quality. Environmental monitoring results will be documented \nto ensure that signs of adverse impacts are detected at the earliest possible time. Monitoring \nresults before and during construction will be reported monthly by the designated environment \nspecialist  in  the  PPMU.  An  annual  monitoring  report  will  be  prepared  by  the  PPMU's \nenvironmental management unit and submitted to the PPMU head, who will in turn submit it to \nthe Department of Natural Resources and Environment for endorsement to the THP People's \nCommittee. The monitoring report will be submitted to ADB together with the semi-annual \nprogress reports. The summary initial environmental examination and IEE are in Supplementary \nAppendixes I and J. \nC.  Economic Aspects \n49.  The project components are mutually reinforcing and have positive externalities. Overall \nreturns to project investment are likely to be greater than the sum of the individual components. \nThe proposed Project is a comprehensive and multisectoral project that will direct investments \nto priority areas and create a sustainable urban environment for Thanh Hoa and strengthen its \nrole of provincial capital by becoming an urban service center for the province. \n50.  For the road development component, the Project will yield a net present value of some \n$8.6 million and an economic internal rate of return (EIRR) of 17.2%. The sensitivity analysis \nshows a relatively stable EIRR, mostly affected if benefits are delayed by a year, which would \nyield an EIRR of 15.4%. For the water supply component, the results of the base-case EIRR \nanalysis show an EIRR of 14.9%. Sensitivity analysis is acceptable, with a reduction of about \n1% in the EIRR. For the drainage component, it is projected that about 143,000 people will live \nin the urban core by 2025, of which at least 50,000 could be affected by flooding. Pollution \nwould continue to build up in urban and nearby waterways, providing a significant health hazard \nto inhabitants and visitors alike. The Project will not eliminate flooding entirely but it will reduce \nthe severity and duration of flooding. For the human resource development component, the \neconomic rationale for subcomponent selection is based on the expected benefits of vocational \ntraining on tourism and industrial development. For the tourism component, Thanh Hoa expects \n49,900 additional visitors in the first year of the Project, rising to 342,000 in 2035. The EIRR is \nestimated to be 19% and is most sensitive to a reduction by 20% in tourists\u2019 spending, which \nyields an EIRR of 16%. Lastly, EIRR is 16% if average daily expenditures by tourists are less \nthan 20%. The outline of the economic analysis is in Appendix 10 and the full version in \nSupplementary Appendix K. \nD.  Financial Aspects \n51.  The  preliminary  financial  analysis  has  been  undertaken  in  accordance  with  ADB's \nGuidelines  for  Financial  Management  and  Analysis  of  Projects  (2006).  It  is  based  on \nincremental  benefits  and  costs,  and  has  been  undertaken  for  two  revenue  generating \ncomponents of the Project: (i) water supply development and expansion, and (ii) wastewater \n ", "18 \ntreatment. The analysis is also based on the ability of the Executing Agency to repay its debt \nobligations for the other nonrevenue generating components of the Project. In addition, the \nfinancial  analysis  includes  a  sustainability  analysis  that  assesses  whether  these  revenue \ngenerating  components  can  generate  sufficient  revenues  to  cover  capital  investment  and \noperation costs, as measured by financial internal rates of return (FIRRs), and meet or exceed \nthe weighted cost of capital (WACC) of 1.5% used to finance these projects. \n52.  For water supply, the investment should contribute to improving the existing distribution \nnetwork and expanding the service area to urban villages (about 75,000 inhabitants with an \naverage daily consumption of 70 liters per capita). Initial projections indicate a need to increase \nwater tariffs (by 25% in 2009 and 15% in 2010) to achieve full cost recovery. The FIRR over the \nperiod of the loan is estimated at 15.3% and sensitivity analysis revealed that it is most sensitive \nto an increase in O&M costs and a delay in the tariff increase. \n53.  The investment in the drainage and wastewater treatment plant will reduce flooding and \nremove wastewater from the eight inner urban wards, improve sewage through the construction \nof a 20 km sewer system, and build a wastewater treatment plant with a treatment capacity of \nup to 10,000 m3 per day for the urban core. At the same time it will upgrade the existing \ndrainage  network  and  construct  additional  primary  and  secondary  drains.  The  financial \nprojection indicated that regular tariff increases would be necessary to achieve basic cost \nrecovery. FIRR for drainage and wastewater is estimated at 4.2% and is most sensitive to a \ndelay in the tariff increase. The financial analysis is in Appendix 11. The detailed financial \nassessment of the people\u2019s committee is in Supplementary Appendix L. The financial analysis \nof public operating entities (THWSC and URENCO) is in Supplementary Appendix M. \nE.  Risks and Mitigation Measures \n54.  Project risks include the potential lack of commitment from the Project\u2019s beneficiaries \n(resulting from a lack of ownership), currency fluctuations and other macroeconomic changes, \nunanticipated external economic events, and decentralized project administration. The following \nmeasures will be taken to mitigate these risks: (i) extensive consultations with key stakeholders \nduring project preparation, (ii) provision of a safe buffer in terms of higher contingency amounts, \nand (iii) close monitoring by ADB using performance-based indicators during implementation. \n55.  The Project\u2019s success is based on the following assumptions: (i) the Government, ADB, \nand key stakeholders ensure that qualified consultants and personnel are recruited for the \nProject and that disbursements of counterpart and other funds are made in a timely manner; \n(ii)  commitment  of  people's  committees  to  undertake  policy  and  institutional  reforms;  \n(iii) implementation of suggested cost-recovery mechanisms and tariff adjustments; (iv) active \nparticipation  and  sense  of  ownership  from  stakeholders  and  project  beneficiaries;  \n(v)  stakeholder  and  beneficiary  support  for  the  Project;  and  (vi)  implementation  of \nenvironmental, social, and resettlement requirements. \nV.

Overview of the Viet Nam Urban Context \n1.  For the past two decades, Viet Nam has made the transition from a centrally planned \neconomy to a market-oriented system with unprecedented success. This transition has been \nmade possible by political stability, government commitment for economic reforms, and targeted \nprograms to provide basic public infrastructure. From 1993 to 2006, poverty declined from \n58.1% to 22.0%, gross domestic product per capita increased from $288 to $622, and economic \noutput rose by an average of 7.5% per year.1 Agriculture's share in total economic output \ndeclined from 30% to 21% while manufacturing and services rose from 70% to  79%. Between \n2001 and 2006, industrial production and domestic and international trade grew at an average \nannual rate of 17%, while foreign direct investment increased by 650%. The Government is \nincreasingly recognizing the private sector\u2019s pivotal role in economic development and job \ncreation. Preliminary estimates indicate that the private sector generated almost 90% of the 7.5 \nmillion  jobs  created  during  the  5  years  to  2005,  of  which  64%  were  generated  by  small \nenterprises. \n2.  Economic development is also reflected in the rapid growth of urban areas. With a \npopulation of 85 million, only 19.6 million (23%) live in urban areas, while 65.4 million (77%) live \nin rural areas. However, this is rapidly changing. As the rate of urban population growth rate has \naveraged 5.4% per year during the past 10 years, it is expected that by 2020 the urban \npopulation will comprise 41.6 million (40%) of Viet Nam\u2019s projected population of 104 million. \nHowever,  most of the urban growth is occurring in the metropolises of Ho Chi Minh City \n(population 5.2 million) and Ha Noi (population 3.1 million), followed by Hai Phong and Da \nNang. The next tier of secondary cities2 is experiencing lower growth rates. As a result, major \nmetropolises are receiving large inflows of migration, are becoming more congested , and are \nexperiencing  increasingly  serious  social  and  environmental  problems.  At  the  same  time, \nsecondary cities are stagnating. If the neglect of secondary city development continues, the \nspatial and economic disparities will further constrain not only urban development, but also Viet \nNam\u2019s overall economic development. \n3.  The main challenges facing secondary cities stem from obsolete urban infrastructure \nand lack infrastructure investments, particularly in road networks, water supply, environmental \nsanitation  (drainage,  sewerage,  hazardous  waste,  wastewater  treatment,  solid  waste \nmanagement, and air pollution control), power, and communications. The lack of infrastructure \ndiscourages  outside  investments  that  are  critical  to  catalyzing  economic  development  and \ngrowth.  The  causes  are  multifaceted  but  interrelated,  and  include  but  are  not  limited  to: \n(i)  inadequate  financing  and  cost  recovery  for  capital  expenditures  and  operation  and \nmaintenance;  (ii)  the  existence  of  policy,  institutional,  and  structural  bottlenecks  that  deter \nprivate investment that could free up scarce government resources; and (iii) limited human \nresource capacity to plan, operate, and manage urban assets and provide urban services. \nAlleviating these constraints has proved difficult as population increases have put additional \npressure on public services provision, reduced living standards, and polluted the environment. \nThe absence of strong and effective governance and broad-based support and participation \nfrom civil society (including the private sector, community groups, and societal organizations) \nhas compounded these problems. \n                                                 \n1  Poverty is based on data obtained from the Ministry of Labor, Invalids and Social Affairs, 2005. \n2  Secondary cities, defined here as class II cities, have populations of 250,000 or more. A detailed definition is in \nfootnote 1, page 2. \n ", "Appendix 2  27 \nB.  Regulatory Framework and Strategies for Urban Development \n4.  The lack of an enforceable regulatory framework for urban infrastructure provision as \nwell  as  effective  institutions  has  constrained  effective  and  efficient  infrastructure  service \nprovision. Since 1990 the Government has introduced policies and reforms to improve the \nefficiency  of  the  urban  sector  and  promote  urban  development3 which  aim  to  (i)  promote \nbalanced and sustainable economic growth between regions, (ii) develop urban areas to create \nmore  jobs  and  improve  living  standards,  and  (iii)  strengthen  environmental  protection  and \nensure a healthy environment. The Government has endorsed a series of orientation plans \nrelated to urban development.4 \n5.  Currently there are 11 secondary cities, designated as class II cities, that have been \npromoted as target cities to limit growth in Ha Noi and Ho Chi Minh City. As a part of ADB\u2019s \nurban development assistance strategy for Viet Nam, class II candidates are being targeted for \nassistance  and  investments  to  upgrade  and  expand  urban  infrastructure  along  with  \u201csoft\u201d \ninvestments in capacity building, institutional reform, and societal participation. The assistance \nis also designed to attract development partners, the private sector, and other sources of \nfunding to further enhance city development. For selection purposes, several criteria were \ndeveloped:  (i)  urban  population  growth,  (ii)  urban  and  rural  poverty  level,  (iii)  economic \ndevelopment potential, (iv) infrastructure needs, and (v) special features that could potentially \nbe developed (e.g., tourism, cultural heritage, sustainable industrial development, environmental \nfeatures).  Based  on  these  criteria,  Thanh  Hoa  City  was  selected  as  a  model  project  for \nsocioeconomic development. \nC.  Urban Development in Thanh Hoa \n6.  Thanh Hoa City (Thanh Hoa) became a class II in 2004. It is the capital, administrative \ncenter, and only major urban center of Thanh Hoa Province (THP) Viet Nam\u2019s third largest \nprovince with a population of 3.7 million. THP\u2019s gross domestic product per capita is only half \nthe country average and its economic growth rate over the past 5 years is below the county\u2019s \n7.5%. Its rates of unemployment (50%) and poverty level (30%) are both well above national \naverages. THP is the second poorest province in Viet Nam and investment in infrastructure has \nbeen  lagging.  However  its  industrial  output  has  been  increasing  significantly,  currently \naccounting for 22.8% of the province's total economic output. \n7.  Thanh Hoa is located at the confluence of Ma and Chu rivers. Aside from the limestone \npeaks framing the city to the north and west, the city is relatively flat. The National Highway 1A \nand Le Loi Avenue, the main thoroughfares, intersect at the city center and serve as the \n                                                 \n3  Government of Viet Nam. 2003. Comprehensive Poverty Reduction and Growth Strategy, 2001\u20132010, Social \nEconomic Development Plan, 2006\u20132010 and Orientation Plan for Urban Development to 2020. Hanoi. \n4  The Orientation Plan for Urban Development to 2020 seeks to develop cities as economic growth centers, \nmodernize technical and social infrastructure to attract investment and improve living standards, reduce gaps \nbetween urban and rural areas, and ensure sustainable urban development. The Orientation Plan for Water \nSupply Development to 2020 aims to upgrade and expand water supply system to ensure 100% coverage and 24-\nhour uninterrupted service in urban areas by 2020, reduce nonrevenue water to 30% and ensure full cost recovery \nfor capital expenditures and operation and maintenance, equitize all publicly owned water utility companies by \n2010, protect water sources, and promote public awareness and participation. The Orientation Plan for Urban \nDrainage Development to 2020 seeks to upgrade drainage and sewerage systems to ensure 80\u201390% coverage by \n2020, require enterprises to have on-site treatment for toxic waste, eliminate pit latrines in urban areas by 2010, \nprovide collection systems for solid and liquid waste, and rehabilitate drainage systems. Lastly, the Orientation \nPlan for Solid Waste Management and Industrial Waste to 2020 aims to collect and dispose of at least 95% of \nurban and industrial waste by 2020, complete the legal framework to complement the Law on Environmental \nProtection, increase investments in solid waste management infrastructure, and promote public awareness on \nenvironmental hygiene and protection. \n \n ", "28  Appendix 2 \nbackbone of the street system in Thanh Hoa. The city center has a system of canals that form a \nmoat to an ancient citadel; the canals drain into the Ma River. Since being upgraded to a class II \ncity, Thanh Hoa\u2019s area has expanded to 60 square kilometers (km2), comprising 12 wards \ncovering 23 km2, and six communes occupying the remainder.  \n8.  Thanh Hoa has three main industrial zones, namely Le Mon (88 ha, 23 factories) to the \nsoutheast along highway 47 Tay Bac Ga (67 ha, 62 factories); Dinh Huong (30 ha, 30 factories) \nto the northwest, close to National Highway A1; and Nui Vuc stone quarries to the southwest. \nOther industrial zones nearby but outside of Thanh Hoa are the Bim Son, Lang Son, and Nghi \nSon industrial zones. Outside the urban core toward the south is a suburban area composed of \npaddy fields, villages, and townships. About 35% of Thanh Hoa\u2019s total population lives in this \narea. Among Thanh Hoa\u2019s potential tourist zones are the Ham Rong tourism zone north of the \ncity,  which  has  nice  limestone  scenery  and  several  historical  relics;  the  Dong  Son \narchaeological park, which depicts Thanh Hoa\u2019s 2,500-year culture; Mat Son, a river walk close \nto the city center; handicraft and stone processing villages in the southwest near Nui Vuc stone \nquarries, with big, scenic limestone rocks and a temple. Close by is Sam Son, a popular beach \nresort town 16 kilometers (km) east of Thanh Hoa, and the Hoang Hoa district north of Sam \nSon, with a pristine beach extending 12 km to the north. These potentially attractive areas have \nyet to be developed. \n9.  The current demographic trend indicates a shift in population growth and migration, both \nfor THP and Thanh Hoa. Thanh Hoa Province is one of the most densely populated provinces in \nViet Nam. It is expected that within the next 10 years there will be a labor surplus of 700,000 \nbecause the population is growing at an annual rate of 3.2%. On the other hand, Thanh Hoa, \nwith a population of 200,000, has an annual population growth rate of only 1.9 %. If this trend \ncontinues, out-migration  from  THP  will  increase,  but not  necessarily  to  Thanh  Hoa,  which \nmeans that it will struggle to attract additional population. The tentative conclusion, therefore, is \nthat THP will supply migrants not to Thanh Hoa, but to the large metropolises of Ha Noi and Ho \nChi Minh City. Although Thanh Hoa has nearly a universal secondary-level graduation rate, only \n18% of the population has a tertiary education or professional training. There are 15 continuous \ntraining centers, 20 vocational training institutions, and one university\u2014Hong Duc in Thanh Hoa \n(6,000 students). Therefore, to improve Thanh Hoa\u2019s competitiveness and attract migration, the \nproductivity of the labor force must be improved through education and skills training. \n10.  Urban  infrastructure  facilities  are  in  general  deficient.  For  urban  roads,  the  main \nthoroughfares of Le Loi and National Road 1A and their surroundings have just been upgraded \nand are in generally good condition. However, some secondary roads, most village roads, and \nroads leading from the city center to the urban periphery and non-urban areas in the city are \ndeteriorated. Travel time from urban villages to the city may take one hour or more because of \npoor road conditions. There are currently 54 km of roads. Urgent priorities for Thanh Hoa are to \ncomplete missing links in the road network connecting secondary roads, improve access to \nhandicraft villages and tourism sites, and improve operation and maintenance of road surfaces. \nPiped water supply coverage is currently around 60%. The remaining population use dug wells \nas their main water source; nonrevenue water losses are about 45%. Thanh Hoa has a 24-hour \nuninterrupted water supply and daily consumption is 90 liters per capita per day (l/p/d) in the \nurban area and 70 l/p/d in peri-urban areas. The average daily water demand is about 45,000 \ncubic meters per day (cmd), whereby current production is 30,000 cmd, serving Thanh Hoa, \nSamson, and five other townships. Drainage is problematic as Thanh Hoa\u2019s topography is flat \nand during the rainy season up to one-third of the city is flooded. The social assessment notes \nthat  in  some  areas,  only  40%  of  households  have  latrines.  There  are  neither  wastewater \ntreatment plants nor wastewater stabilization ponds. \n \n ", "Appendix 2  29 \n11.  Thanh Hoa has developed an ambitious new master plan that aims to make Thanh Hoa \na class I city, with a population of 500,000, by 2015. Significant growth is expected to occur as a \nresult of expanding the city boundary to  150 km2 to incorporate Sam Son town. The urban core \nbuilt-up area will be upgraded, particularly with the rehabilitation of road, public parks, and open \nspaces along National Highway A1; improvements of the administrative and business district  \nalong Le Loi Avenue; construction of a bridge crossing the Ma River; and plans for building a \nnew industrial zone during the next 10 years, to be located either in Hoang Hoa district to the \nnorth or Quang Xuong district in the south. In addition, there are expressions of interest from \nprivate  investors  to  upgrade  tourism  facilities  at  Ham  Rong  and  Mat  Son;  develop  hotel \naccommodations as well as commercial and entertainment centers; and develop the tourist \ntown of Sam Son and the Hoang Ha district. Other notable special features of Thanh Hoa \ninclude a robust fresh seafood industry, and an attractive ecotourism area along the De River. \nThe eco-industrial reorganization and tourism development success will depend largely on the \nskill level and capacity of the local population to participate in these activities. Without improved \nskills, efficient and sustainable economic development will not be possible. \n \nD.  Required Investments for Sustainable Urban Development \n12.  Thanh Hoa must initiate steps to capitalize on its strengths and opportunities as well as \navert its threats and overcome its weaknesses. Its main strengths and advantages are its \nlocation (along main transportation routes, and proximity to Ha Noi,), its capacity to expand, \nboth economically and geographically.  \n13.  Official development assistance has been an important vehicle to develop Viet Nam\u2019s \nurban infrastructure. About $1.2 billion investments have been injected into the country's urban \nsector since 1995, of which ADB has provided $450 million. ADB\u2019s country strategy for Viet \nNam\u2019s urban sector emphasizes targeted infrastructure investments in small and medium-sized \ntowns in the central region and along economic corridors, thereby diverting migration to the \nlarge cities, principally Ha Noi and Ho Chi Minh City. This will require large investments in \ninfrastructure; decentralized and improved urban governance; adequate cost recovery of urban \nservices; improved human resource capacity; promotion of broad-based participation from the \nprivate  sector  and  community  groups;  and  inclusive  development  that  takes  into  account \nvulnerable groups, ethnic minorities, and women. These investments will be defined based on \nthe City Development Strategy in a regional context to be implemented by UN-Habitat and \nfinanced by Cities Alliance.

POVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.  Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \n \nViet Nam\u2019s Socio-Economic Development Plan 2006\u20132010 aims to achieve industrialized country status by 2020. The \ncountry's poverty reduction strategy is included in the plan. The strategy notes that increased private investment and \ninternational economic integration are crucial to creating jobs, improving living standards, and alleviating poverty. As Viet Nam \nbecomes more urbanized, cities are playing larger roles as economic growth centers and nodes of development. However, for \nthis to happen public infrastructure must be improved through broad-based participation from the private sector and society, \ntaking into account vulnerable groups, ethnic minorities, and women. ADB\u2019s urban sector strategy for Viet Nam emphasizes \ntargeted infrastructure investments in small and medium-sized towns along economic corridors and thereby diverts migration \naway from the large cities of Ha Noi and Ho Chi Minh City.  \n \nThanh Hoa Province (THP), the third largest province in Viet Nam, has an area of 11,168 square kilometers (km2) and a \npopulation of 3.7 million, of which only 9.8% live in urban areas. THP is the second poorest province in Viet Nam, with a \npoverty level of 36% (2006) and a gross domestic product (GDP) per capita that is half the national average. THP also has \nthe second highest population density among Viet Nam provinces. The capital, Thanh Hoa City (Thanh Hoa), located 160 \nsouth of Ha Noi, has a population of 197,500 (2006) with a low-skilled workforce and obsolete urban infrastructure \u2014\nparticularly  road  networks,  water  supply  and  sanitation  facilities,  and  wastewater  treatment  facilities.  The  increasing \npopulation density, poverty incidence, and lack of employment in rural areas is gradually transforming agricultural land to \nurban use in the peripheral areas and putting pressure on Thanh Hoa\u2019s existing infrastructure and services, as well as \ncreating pockets of poverty in the urban core due  mainly to the arrival of migrants. By addressing urgent development needs, \nthe proposed Project will enable Thanh Hoa to realize its vision of becoming a dynamic, competitive, bankable and livable \nsecondary city and one of north-central Viet Nam's key commercial hubs. The Project will, among other things, develop an \nintegrated road network connecting the city center with its peri-urban areas, which will lead to savings in travel time and \nshorten the distance between suppliers and markets; support water supply, sewerage, and drainage improvements to improve \nproductivity, public health, and the general well-being of the population; improve job skills in key sectors and increase the \nproductivity of the local workforce in order to increase incomes and make Thanh Hoa more competitive as a whole; and \ndevelop the local tourism industry. In addition to the ensuing investment loan, a Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction grant \nproject will facilitate investments in smaller-scale, community infrastructure and services in poor urban and peri-urban areas. \nBy providing access to capital assets and a source of income for individuals or community groups operating small-scale \nbusinesses and affordable basic urban services for individuals who currently lack access to such services, this grant will help \nmaximize the overall poverty and socioeconomic impacts of the larger investment Project. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                                    Targeting Classification: General intervention \n  \nKey Issues  \nIn general, residents in peri-urban areas are poorer than residents in the urban core. The lack of infrastructure and basic \nservices and physical isolation, (particularly in peri-urban areas that lack transportation access to the city), exacerbated by low \nlabor productivity, ill health, and poor job skills were considered the main causes of poverty in the peri-urban areas. Low \nincomes and a lack of jobs are causing people to migrate from Thanh Hoa to more competitive cities both in Viet Nam and \nabroad. While the secondary education graduation rate is high (77%), the vocational or tertiary education enrollment levels \nare low (17%). With the share of agriculture in Thanh Hoa\u2019s total economic output on the decline, the manufacturing and \nservice sectors  (particularly tourism and trade) are assuming increased importance in creating jobs. Thanh Hoa will need to \nembark on socially inclusive development that targets poor peri-urban dwellers and vulnerable groups and promotes \ninvestment in citywide infrastructure, human resource development, and improved urban management. \nII.  SOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n \nFindings of Social Analysis \nA social impact assessment was carried out to assess the socioeconomic profile of Thanh Hoa; analyze the social dimension \nof poverty; identify key issues and potential project impacts on women, the poor, ethnic minorities and vulnerable groups; \nrecommend opportunities for pro-poor design of the project components; and suggest monitoring and evaluation indicators. \nSecondary data collection, interviews, and a socioeconomic survey were used to obtain data. The assessment highlighted \nthat the poverty rate in urban wards was about 13.6%. The assessment concluded that, although the poverty rate has been \ndecreasing, Thanh Hoa will need to embark on socially inclusive development that targets poor peri-urban dwellers and \n ", "  Appendix 9  47 \nvulnerable groups and promotes investment in citywide infrastructure, human resource development, and improved urban \nmanagement.  \n \nKey Issues \nA key social issue is the need for socially inclusive provision of basic infrastructure in peri-urban areas. Other key issues \ninclude the lack of technical and service-related skills among the workforce to meet the demands of industry and tourism; \ninadequate provision of vocational skills training linked with industry growth, coupled with a low overall rate of participation in \nvocational education, especially among women; and the need for community consultation and participation in infrastructure \nand tourism development. \n \nB.  Consultation and Participation \n1.  Provide a summary of the consultation and participation process during the project preparation. \nConsultation workshops were held during project preparation to obtain inputs from the following stakeholders: THP and Thanh \nHoa peoples committees, provincial and city departments, civil society organizations, representatives of vocational training \ninstitutions, business owners, commune leaders, and project beneficiaries. Consultations were also held with women and the \nyouth to ensure participation during project design and implementation. These consultations provided useful inputs for \ndeveloping the Project\u2019s components, and were also essential for preparing appropriate mitigation measures to address \nresettlement, social impacts, and environmental impacts, and for defining a gender strategy for the Project. \n \n2.  What level of consultation and participation (C&P) is envisaged during the project implementation and monitoring?  \n  Information sharing          Consultation         Collaborative decision making       Empowerment \n \n3.  Was a C&P plan prepared?   Yes      No  \nA participation strategy has been streamlined into the project design and social safeguard documents to ensure that the \nvarious stakeholders continue to participate during implementation. The Project will work together at the commune/ward level \nand  establish  participation  structures  to  implement  infrastructure  and  community  sanitation  improvements.  Continued \ndiscussions and subsequent disclosure of social safeguard documents will be made to ensure that affected people, especially \nvulnerable groups, are aware of proposed mitigation and rehabilitation measures, particularly on the issues of resettlement \nand other social impacts. \n \nC.  Gender and Development \nKey Issues \nThe gender assessment was carried out to analyze the situation of women in the project area, their participation in the labor \nmarket (formal or informal), their access to basic social services, the constraints on women\u2019s access to the urban labor \nmarket, and the potential for increased participation by women in the labor market as tourism, small and medium-sized \nenterprises, and industry and trade investment increase and expand. In accordance with Viet Nam\u2019s Law on Gender Equality, \neffective July 2007, and the recent decree for the implementation of the law on gender equality (N70/2008/ND, 4 June 2008), the \nproject interventions will contribute to promoting gender equity and opportunities for women by mainstreaming gender-\nresponsive strategies across all the sectors of intervention. Capacity building to enable the stakeholder institutions to \nimplement activities that promote equal opportunity and participation for women and men will be provided under the project \nGender Strategy and Plan.  \nKey Actions.

Introduction \n1.  The economic analysis has been undertaken in accordance with the Guidelines for the \nEconomic  Analysis  of  Projects  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB).  The  analysis  also \nincorporates some consideration related to the long-term management and operation of facilities \nto help achieve the intended project impact. \n2.  The Government of Viet Nam aims to alleviate migration pressure on Hanoi and Ho-Chi-\nMinh City and achieve more geographically balanced and sustainable, economic growth. The \nnational Orientation Master Plan for Urban Development to 2020 projects that population in \nurban areas will grow from 14 million in 1998 (23%) to 38 million by 2020 (39%). Thanh Hoa \nProvince (THP) is one of Viet Nam's most populous provinces and also one of its poorest. THP \nis divided into two areas, the mountainous area and the plain area. The population in 2006 was \n3.7 million people and the gross domestic product (GDP) was D22,000 billion, equivalent to \nabout $350 per capita. There are five urban centers: the capital, Thanh Hoa City (Thanh Hoa), \nwith a population of 200,000; Sam Son, a beach resort about 15 kilometers (km) from Thanh \nHoa, and Bim Son (both about 60,000 population); Lam Son; and Nghi Son. The main crop is \nrice. The plain area has around 2.8 million persons, and with a density of more than 1,000 \ninhabitants per ha has one of the highest rural population densities in the world. Important \nindustries include agro-processing, construction materials, shipbuilding and repair in Nigh Son, \nautomobile assembly and components in Binh Son and Nigh Son, and hydropower in the \nWestern part of the province. Tourism activities are focused on the beach resort of Sam Son, \nwhich attracts more than 1 million persons per year. \n3.  Thanh  Hoa  is  approximately  150  km  south  of  Hanoi.  The  main  industries  are \nconstruction materials, real estate construction, and agro-processing. The policy context and \noverarching  rationale  for  this  Project  is  driven  by  the  Government\u2019s  Socio-Economic \nDevelopment Plan (SEDP) 2006\u20132010. The official urban national policy as contained in the \nOrientation Master Plan for Urban Development to 2020 aims to establish population targets for \ncities and alleviate migration and population pressure on the large metropolises of Ha Noi and \nHo Chi Minh City by promoting the sustainable development of small and medium-sized cities \nsuch as Thanh Hoa. ADB\u2019s country strategy for Viet Nam\u2019s urban sector emphasizes targeted \ninfrastructure investments in small and medium-sized towns in the central region and along \neconomic  corridors.  A  lack  of  urban  infrastructure  investments  is  seen  as  one  of  the \nweaknesses facing secondary cities. Thanh Hoa\u2019s goal is now to achieve class I status and \nbecome a \u201dNational City\u201d by 2015. The principle of sustainable growth is embodied in Thanh \nHoa\u2019s city master plan. \n4.  Beyond 2011, with the Project, the population increases rapidly and by the reference \nyear  2025  reaches  the  target  of  500,000  people.  In  the  without-project  scenario,  the  city \ncontinues to grow, but at recent trend rates by 2025 the population within the current city limits \ngrows only from about 200,000 to about 260,000, while the population outside the current city \nlimits grows from about 120,000 to 134,000. It is important to appreciate that under the without-\nproject scenario, Thanh Hoa would grow anyway, partly as a result of natural investment inflows \nincreases in economic activity. Without the Project, Thanh Hoa is unlikely to decline in absolute \nterms. Rather, without the project the population will not grow as rapidly, as the proposed \nproject will help increase economic opportunity and activity as well as provide infrastructure and \nservices for the planned growth in line with the city master plan. \n ", "50  Appendix 10 \n \n5.  A GDP comparison with other provinces demonstrates that Thanh Hoa is one of the \npoorest in Viet Nam and that it lags behind other provinces. In 2005, GDP per capita was \nsecond lowest of all the provinces. It was only half the national average and less than one \nquarter that of Hanoi. If current trends are allowed to continue, Thanh Hoa, although it is a \nprovincial capital, will not be able to attract the necessary investments and serve as a regional \nhub of north central Viet Nam. \n6.  The project components are mutually reinforcing and have positive externalities. Overall \nreturns to project investment are likely to be greater than the sum of the individual components. \nThe proposed Project is a comprehensive and multi-sectoral project that intends to target the \nmain priority investments and create a suitable and sustainable urban environment for Thanh \nHoa and strengthen its role of provincial capital by becoming an urban service center for the \nprovince. The expected outputs will be: (i) an improved urban road network and associated \nbasic urban services, through the construction of about 20 kilometers (km) of new and upgraded \nroads; (ii) an expanded water supply distribution network, including about 20 km of primary and \nsecondary  piped  water  supply  pipes  and  water  connections;  (iii)  improved  drainage  and \nwastewater  treatment through  the  construction  of  47  km  of  interceptors  for sewerage  and \ndrainage and two wastewater treatment facilities; (iv) a well developed tourism infrastructure at \nthe tourist sites of Ham Rong, and Mat Son as well as the archaeological site of Dong Son; and \n(v) improved labor productivity and job skills achieved by developing vocational training centers. \nB.  Urban Transport Component  \n7.  Viet Nam\u2019s Highway No. 1, which connects  Hanoi to Ho Chi Minh City, runs through the \ncenter of Thanh Hoa. Across the city\u2019s east-west axis lies Route 47, which leads to Sam Son on \nthe coast. A traffic count found daily traffic in the region to be as follows: (i) Tran Phu (Highway \nNo. 1): 18,300 passenger car units (PCU)/day; (ii) Le Loi: 21,657 PCU/day; and (iii) Nui Vap: \n1,238 PCU/day. Traffic counts were undertaken on the Eastern Belt with 367 PCU/day and \nWestern Belt with 286 PCU/day. \nTable A9: Traffic Count for Thanh Hoa \nPCU Conversion  Thanh Hoa Traffic \nVehicle Type \nFactor  Composition in 2008 \nCar   1.0  1% \nMini-Bus and Light Truck  2.0  5% \nMedium Truck   3.0  9% \nMotorbike  0.3  63% \nBicycle  0.2  22% \n  Total     100% \n  PCU = passenger car units. \n  Source: Thanh Hoa City statistics. \n8.  Traffic growth in Thanh Hoa is forecast to grow at 10% per annum until 2019 and at 8% \nper annum thereafter. The  road design acknowledged the varying characteristics of existing \ninfrastructure in the area and recommended that the water and wastewater connections as well \nas the drainage works be implemented simultaneously with the road works. To determine the \nnet benefits, the least cost method was used. \n ", "  Appendix 10  51 \n9.  Over the analysis period to 2035, total travel time saved as a result of the Project was \nestimated at about 84 million minutes \u2013 a reduction in travel time of some 43% compared with \nthe without-project case. Economic costs for the road projects total some $19.7 million in capital \ncosts, and another $0.49 million in annual operations and maintenance. Under the base case, \nthe Project yields a net present value of some $8.6 million and an economic internal rate of \nreturn (EIRR) of 17.2%. EIRR remains solid in sensitivity tests. In a scenario of costs increasing \nto 10%, EIRR remains relatively stable at 16.1%, and if benefits decrease to 10%, the EIRR is \n15.9%. If benefits are delayed by a year, EIRR is 15.4%. \nC.  Water Supply Expansion and Upgrading Component \n10.  Water  supply  in  Thanh  Hoa  is  provided  by  Thanh  Hoa  Water  Supply  Company \n(THWSC). The company covers Thanh Hoa, Bim Son, Sam Son, and other small settlements. \nCoverage  in  Thanh  Hoa  is  estimated  at  90%  for  the  urban  population  and  60%  for  the  \nperi-urban population. The estimated population served in 2007 is 160,000.  \n11.  It is proposed that the Project provide finance for a 20 km pipe network in the city core. \nThis represents nearly all (20 km of 24 km) of the remaining pipe network not replaced under \nanother ADB loan project.1 For the replacement of pipes in the city core, cost effectiveness is \naddressed by the amount of nonrevenue water generated. \n12.  In line with national Government guidelines for urban water supply, it is assumed that by \n2010, the demand for water will increase to 110 liters per capita per day (lcd) for the urban core \npopulation, and to 70 lcd for the peri-urban population. The current THWSC investment program \nwill increase capacity from 50,000 m3 per day to 60,000 m3 per day by 2010. The population of \nthe city grows at higher rates and reaches 500,000 by 2025 under the with-project scenario, and \ngrows at slower rates, reaching about 420,000 by 2025, in the without-project scenario. The \npercentage of water allocated to Thanh Hoa (as opposed to other towns also served by the \nTHWSC)  is  75%  based  on  the  current  population  distribution.  The  nonrevenue  water  is \nassumed to be 40%, decreasing to 25% with the Project. Without the Project, nonrevenue water \nis assumed to increase to 45% in 2015 and 50% by 2025. \n13.  The results of the base case EIRR analysis show an EIRR of 14.9%. Sensitivity analysis \nis satisfactory, as EIRR is 13.9% in a scenario where costs increase to 10%, and EIRR is 13.8% \nif benefits decrease to 10%. In a scenario where nonrevenue water decreases to 30%, EIRR \nremains stable at 13.8%. \nD.  Drainage and Wastewater Treatment \n14.  The economic analysis follows accepted least-cost criteria for the analysis of wastewater \ninfrastructure investments. Specific targets of the Government include upgrading drainage and \nsewerage  systems  to  ensure  80\u201390%  coverage  by  2020.  In  terms  of  specific  sanitation \ninfrastructure development plans, the Thanh Hoa city master plan proposes separate rain water \nand wastewater systems by 2020. It also targets 100% treatment of wastewater and rain water. \n15.  Drains are mostly located in Thanh Hoa in the main commercial areas and along major \nroads and are in poor condition. During the rainy season from May to October, when water \ndischarge is twice that of the dry season, more than 30% of the city\u2019s urban wards flood. There \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 1995. Report and Recommendation to the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan and \nTechnical Assistance Grants to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for the Provincial Water Supply and Sanitation \nProject. Manila. \n ", "52  Appendix 10 \nis  no  wastewater  treatment  plant  for  the  city.  Tanks  are  generally  poorly  constructed, \nundersized, poorly maintained, not emptied on a regular basis, and overloaded because of rapid \nurbanization.  Flooding  imposes  considerable  economic  costs,  including  property  damage, \nclean-up costs, travel difficulties, loss of employment, and serious health impacts. The Project \ntogether with ongoing Thanh Hoa projects, will provide 47 km of new drains. Overall net benefits \nwill still be constrained by the pollution and health impacts of direct discharge of wastewater into \nadjacent waterways. Available sanitation solutions are as follows: (i) increased septic tank \nprovision and associated support services, (ii) provision of an interceptor sewer to transfer \nwastewater away from urban areas, and (iii) provision of a wastewater treatment plant. \n16.  The chosen project components comprise: (i) completion of the urban core drainage \nsystem, comprising 7.7 km of primary network and 20 km of tertiary network; (ii) provision of a \nnew, semi-separated sanitation and drainage network along the ring belt; (iii) a  single  WSP \ntreatment plant, with capacity to treat 15,000 cubic meters per day; (iv) 9.5 km of interceptors \nand six pumping stations; (v) three small-scale wastewater treatment systems; and (vi) capacity \nbuilding, gender training, and community awareness programs. Economic costs for the up-front \ndrainage and sanitation works total some $29 million. \n17.  Under the without-project scenario, the urban core is projected to house some 143,000 \npeople by 2025, of which at least 50,000 people could be affected by flooding. Pollutants \nconcentrations  would  continue  to  build  up  in  urban  and  nearby  waterways,  providing  a \nsignificant health hazard to Thanh Hoa inhabitants and visitors. Development in the ring belt \nwould be limited and would likely house poorer communities without access to basic public \namenities. In addition, direct discharge of untreated or partially treated wastewater into the Ma \nRiver could affect the attractiveness of nearby Sam Son beach as a tourist destination. Although \nflooding will not be eliminated with the Project in place, the severity and duration of flooding will \nbe reduced. \nE.  Human Resource Development  \n18.  The analysis focuses on the economic rationale for subcomponent selection and a broad \ndescription of expected benefits. Government sees vocational training to be a weak link in the \npotential development of the city. THP\u2019s performance declined significantly in recent years. A \nmore  skilled  workforce  is  needed  to  support  the  overall  Project.  The  tourism  industry  in \nparticular will need skilled workers, as will the many new industries and business services \nexpected to set up shop in the city. Private sector institutions that demonstrated a willingness to \nparticipate and borrow, and/or are already investing in Thanh Hoa, were also given high priority \nin  subcomponent  selection.  The  proposed  Project  incorporates  six  subcomponents \n(i)  a  vocational  college  industry, (ii)  a continuing  education  and  vocational  training  center, \n(iii) a vocational intermediate school of handicrafts, (iv) a vocational intermediate school of \ncommerce and tourism, (v) a vocational center for the blind, and (vi) a vocational intermediate \nschool of construction. \n \n ", "  Appendix 10  53 \nF.  Tourism Development  \n19.  Thanh Hoa is less than three hours away from Hanoi. Tourists can enjoy a wide variety \nof landscapes in the province, from mountains in the west to the beaches in the east, which are \namong Viet Nam\u2019s most famous. It is also the home of Dong Son, an archaeological site with \nancient  temples  and  pagodas.  Thanh  Hoa  tourism  is  not  capitalizing  on  its  potential  for \neconomic growth. Subcomponent selection was based on: (ii) promoting historical architecture, \nhandicraft, archeology, and natural resources; (ii) providing leisure activities for local people as \nwell  as  visitors;  and  (iii)  protecting  the  natural  environment  of  the  city.  The  tourism \nsubcomponents have four main themes: (i) natural landscape and historical significance in Ham \nRong Area, (ii) heritage relics in Dong Son, (iii) limestone resources in Mat Son, and (iv) Ben En \nnational park. In total some 49,900 additional visitors to Thanh Hoa will be generated in the first \nyear of the Project, rising to 342,000 in year 2035. The EIRR for the whole tourism component \nis estimated to be 19.0%. Sensitivity analysis shows a robust EIRR. Should costs increase to \n10%, EIRR decreases to 17.7%. EIRR is 17.6% if the benefits decrease to 10%, and 18.6%, if \nbenefits are delayed by a year. Lastly, EIRR is 16% if average daily expenditures by tourists are \nless than 20%. \n \n ", "54  Appendix 11 \nFINANCIAL ANALYSIS \n \n1.  The  financial  analysis  for  the  Thanh  Hoa  Comprehensive  Socioeconomic \nDevelopment Project (Project) has been undertaken in accordance with the Guidelines for \nFinancial Management and Analysis of Projects (2006) of the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB). The financial analysis is conducted on the basis of an incremental costs and benefits. \nThe analysis is undertaken on two revenue generating components of the Project: (i) the \nwater  supply  development  and  expansion,  and  (ii)  the  construction  and  expansion  of \nwastewater treatment plants. It will also discuss the ability of Thanh Hoa Province to repay \nits debt obligations for the other nonrevenue generating components in this Project. The \nfinancial sustainability of each of the revenue generating components was assessed using \nfinancial internal rates of return (FIRRs) that meet or exceed the weighted average cost of \ncapital (WACC). \n2.  Key assumptions applied in this financial analysis are: \n(i)  The financial analysis on the project entity incorporates recommendations for \ninstitutional development, especially the requirements of tariff increases, and \nconsiders only the incremental revenue and cost\u2014capital expenditures and \noperations and maintenance (O&M) associated directly with the component. \n(ii)  The FIRR and average incremental financial cost (AIFC) are calculated from \n2009 to 2029. \n(iii)  Incremental revenues are equal to the projected incremental volume of water \nsold, multiplied by the recommended water tariff for water supply. \n(iv)  Another key assumption is the estimation of the required average tariffs to \nfully recover all components of the financial costs. This has been done by \ncalculating the AIFC for the Project\u2014i.e., basing on the present value of \ncapital expenditures and O&M costs at financial prices divided by the volume \nof water sold for each year over the life of the respective components. The \npresent values are calculated by discounting all cash flows at the WACC. The \nAIFC is the minimum tariff required for full cost recovery. \n(v)  Assumptions employed in the treatment of Urban Environmental Company's \n(URENCO) financial performance assessment comprised three parameters:  \nfinancial projections include all revenues and costs incurred by URENCO \nover the forecasted period: 2009\u20132029; projected capital costs and operating \nrevenues are presented in dong and expressed in current prices; and the \nprojection assumes that the loan proceeds will be treated as an \u201con-grant\u201d to \nURENCO. \n(vi)  Considering the different service demands, usage patterns, and abilities to \npay for the services by various users, this analysis has divided users of \nproject services into four major groups: domestic, administration, industry, \nand services. \n \n3.  Water Supply Tariff. The proposed water tariff increases are designed to ensure \nthat  revenues  from  water  tariffs  cover  all  O&M  and  depreciation  costs  on  equipment \npursuant to the Vietnamese Government Decree 117/2007/ND-CP dated 11 July 2007, \nwhich  requires  all  water  companies  to  operate  on  a  full-cost-recovery  basis.  The \nrecommended tariff increase is summarized in Table A11.1 below. \n ", "Appendix 11  55 \nTable A11.1: Recommended Level of Water Tariff Increase \nYear    2008  2009  2010  2011  2012  2013  2014 \nWater Supply tariff increase (%)a, b    25 15 5 5  5 10\nDomestic (average)  D/m3  4,100  5,125  5,894  6,188  6,498  6,823  7,505 \n  - less than 10 m3  D/m3  3,100  3,875  4,456  4,679  4,913  5,159  5,675 \n  - from 11 m3 to 20 m3  D/m3  3,700  4,625  5,319  5,585  5,864  6,157  6,773 \n  - from 21 m3 to 30 m3  D/m3  4,400  5,500  6,325  6,641  6,973  7,322  8,054 \n  - above 30 m3  D/m3  5,200  6,500  7,475  7,849  8,241  8,653  9,519 \nNondomestic  D/m3               \nAdministration  D/m3  6,200  7,750  8,913  9,358  9,826  10,317   11,349 \nIndustry  D/m3  6,500  8,125  9,344  9,811  10,301   10,817   11,898 \nServices  D/m3  7,000  8,750  10,063  10,566  11,094   11,649   12,813 \nFull Cost Recovery (%)c  70 94 100 103 104  104 105\nSubsidy from Province (D Million)d  9,238 2,467 0 0 0  0 0\nSubsidy from Province (%)  23.2% 5.5% 0 0 0  0 0\nm3 = cubic meter. \na  Includes 5% value added tax. \nb  Similar increase applied to all the consumers.

Wastewater  Tariff.  Under  Vietnamese  Decree  No.  88/2007/ND-CP  dated  28  May \n2007, URENCO is obligated to make provisions for cost recovery. There are currently two \nsources of revenue generated through URENCO\u2014one is through an environment fee charged \nand collected by THWSC and another through direct tariff on solid waste collection. It should \nalso be noted that, while THWSC collects a 5% environmental fee surcharge based on its \nprevailing water tariff, it also keeps 10% of the total revenue collected as service charge and \nsends the remaining 90% to the provincial taxation bureau. The provincial taxation bureau, in \nturn, will pay 50% to the National Environmental Protection Fund and 50% in the form of a \nsubsidy to URENCO.

This \nenvironment fee is implemented as a surcharge in addition to the solid waste tariff collected for all household. \nThe Government has allowed this surcharge to increase to 10%, and continued gradual increase would be \nrequired to meet cost recovery status. \nSource: Project preparatory technical assistance estimates. \n5.  Water Supply Company. THWSC was established as a provincial-level company with \na mandate to provide water in major urban areas of Thanh Hoa Province (Thanh Hoa City, \nSam Son, Bim Son town, and Hoang Hoa). The company owns and operates three water \ntreatment plants, urban networks, and facilities related to irrigation. It has a current water-\nsupply connection rate of 55% in the urban center. Its activities, besides managing water \nsupply (which contributed 53.9% of its gross revenue in 2007), include equipment sales and \ninstallation, construction services, hotel services, and consulting. In 2010 THWSC plans to \nchange  its  status  through  a  process  of  equitization  (partial  privatization)  in  line  with  the \ngovernment initiative on management of water supply companies wherein the private sector \nwill be encouraged to take up a stake of up to 50%. In reviewing the key financial ratios and \nindicators of THWSC's financial statement, especially its debt service capability, it was found \nthat, after including this loan and after stripping away its non-core businesses, THWSC will not \nhave  sufficient  internal  resources  to  meet  its  debt  service  obligations.  The  company  will \nexperience negative cash flow during the project loan period unless serious efforts are taken to \naddress its O&M and management expenses. Therefore, provincial financial subsidies shall be \nrequired to achieve full cost recovery, as mentioned in Table A11.1. \n6.  Wastewater  Company. URENCO was established as a public utility enterprise in \naccordance with the Vietnamese Government Decree 88/2007/ND-CP issued on May 28, \n2007. The company currently implements, operates, and maintains sewerage network and \nditches. Even though URENCO operates with varying degrees of financial and operational \nautonomy, its operations largely depend on Thanh Hoa City budget allocations for solid waste, \ndrainage, wastewater, and other services. To reduce the need for such dependence, Thanh \nHoa province and city have emphasized the need to adopt a user-paying principle to recover \ncosts for providing services. However, current investments for drainage (which is traditionally \nconsidered financially unsustainable because of its largely nonrevenue generating nature) and \nwastewater treatment are unlikely to be recovered under the present tariff regime. A more \ncreative approach by way of a direct and/or indirect surcharge, a city budget subsidy, and/or a \ncombination thereof would be recommended in order to meet basic cost recovery. In the  \n ", "Appendix 11  57 \nmeantime, the city budget1 shall be required to meet URENCO\u2019s basic O&M costs. Imposing a \ncity maintenance budget as a financial covenant would be recommended, as would requiring a \nservice agreement between URENCO and Than Hoa City. Table A11.3 provides the subsidy \nrequirements from Thanh Hoa to meet URENCO\u2019s basic cost recovery: \nTable A11.3: Subsidy needed by URENCO for Basic Cost Recoverya \nYear  2008  2009  2010  2011  2012  2013  2014\nSubsidy needed for WW and sanitation (D million)  3,045  2,537  2,571 2,657  1,459  1,590 104 \nO&M Subsidy (%)  84  61  55  53  26  26  1 \nO&M = operation and maintenance, URENCO = urban environmental company, WW = wastewater. \na  Subsidy from Thanh Hoa will be required pursuant to Decree 88/2007-NP-CP dated 28 May 2007 requiring cost \nrecovery to cover basic O&M cost and partial contribution to investment in the construction of drainage work. \nSource: Project preparatory technical assistance estimates. \n7.  Provincial  Budget.  The  consolidated  budgets  of  both  the  central  and  local \ngovernments represent about D365,385 billion ($22 billion), of which 75% are maintained with \nthe central Government and 25% disbursed to the province and municipality, city, and district \nlevels.  As  of  2007,  local  taxation  (excluding  oil  revenues,  import  revenues,  and  export \nrevenues) recovered at the local level (province and city taxation bureaus) represented 70% of \nthe total income of the central budget. Only 11 provinces and municipalities contribute to the \nfinancing  of  the  central  budget.  Thanh  Hoa  Province  is  one  of  the  53  provinces  and \nmunicipalities that do not contribute to the financing of the central Government budget, but are \nbeneficiaries of the national equalization system. In 2007, 66% of THP's total income came in \nthe form of subsidies from the central Government. Based on the financial assessment of the \nbudgetary position of THP, and even in the absence of central Government support for these \nnonrevenue generating components of the loan, the province has enough financial capacity to \nmeet the debt service. Fiscal analysis revealed that the charge generated by the project loan \nrepresents a mere 0.38% of the province's total revenues over the next 10 next years. It \nrepresents 1.31% of local revenues, and 0.54% of the annual subsidy received from the \ncentral Government.  As such, the impact of this loan on provincial finances is minimal and \ninsignificant. \n8.  The assessment of affordability is based on the combined cost of water supply and \nwastewater charges using the above cost-recovery tariff. The monthly water and sanitation \ncharges to average income households still remain under the affordability level of 5% of \nhousehold  income.  For  low-income  households,  the  table  below  shows  that  the  average \nexpenditure on water supply and sanitation services could be higher than 5% in 2010 for low-\nincome  households.  Poor  user  groups  will suffer  greater adverse  impacts  from the  tariff; \ntherefore,  to  achieve  a  domestic  positive  impact  for  those  below  the  poverty  level  and \naffordability of 5%, tariffs have to be adjusted and cross subsidy with other user groups will be \nrequired. For example, the domestic tariff set up in Thanh Hoa for users who consume water \nless than 10 m3 could be increased more gradually than for users who consume more  (Table \nA11.4). \n                                                 \n1 A fiscal analysis on the Thanh Hoa City budgetary position reveals that the charge generated by the project loan is \na mere 1.83% of the total revenue of the city over the next 10 next years; 2.13% of its local revenue and 14% of \nthe annual subsidy received from the state government. Other charges assumed to be covered by Thanh Hoa City \ninclude direct O&M for component D (infrastructure training), component E (tourism development), a subsidy to \nURENCO to cover road O&M component A, repayment of the loan for sanitation component C, a portion of the \nO&M costs not recovered by environmental fees, the ADB Central Region Project loan, and a solid waste capital \ninvestment project.

FIRR on Water Supply. The FIRR of the water supply component is estimated based \non water tariff increases as outlined above, and THCWS projections for water supply. This \ninvestment should contribute to improving the existing distribution network and expanding the \nservice area to urban villages (about 75,000 inhabitants with an average daily consumption of \n70 liters per inhabitant). Based on this analysis, it is expected that the FIRR is 15.3%, which \nwill  be  higher  than  the  weighted  average  cost  of  capital  (WACC)  of  1.5%.  Continued \ninstitutional and financial reforms to improve THWSC will be key to improving the overall ratios \n(Table A11.5). \nTable A11.5: Financial Internal Rate of Return on Water Supply \nItem  Water Supply \nFinancial Internal Rate of Return  15.3 % \nSource: Project preparatory technical assistance estimates. \n10.  The sensitivity analysis is conducted to test the robustness of the model. For THWSC, \nthe FIRRs are identified to be most sensitive to an increase in O&M costs or a failure to raise \nwater supply tariffs. As such, it is recommended that the provincial project management unit \n(PPMU  strictly  adheres  to  the  recommended  tariffs  and  implementation  schedules.

Introduction. The Thanh Hoa City Comprehensive Socioeconomic Development \nProject (the Project) is an integrated development plan to establish the City of Thanh \nHoa  as  a  competitive,  livable,  and  sustainable  city,  leading  to  socioeconomic \ndevelopment. The Project has five components, namely: (i) road and transport, (ii) water \nsupply, (iii) sanitation, (iv) infrastructure training, and (v) tourism infrastructure. A project \npreparatory technical assistance (PPTA) project concluded that four of the five project \ncomponents have subprojects that will require land acquisition: (i) the proposed ring belt \nand peripheral road connections subproject under the road and transport component; \n(ii) the wastewater treatment pond subproject under the sanitation component; (iii) the \nsubproject to expand and upgrade the Thanh Hoa Vocational College of Industry under \nthe infrastructure training component; and (iv) the subproject to establish an information \ncentre in Ham Rong Ward and the Le River beautification subproject under the tourism \ninfrastructure component. \n2.  Scope of Land Acquisition and Resettlement Impacts. An estimated 49.5 \nhectares (ha) of land will be permanently acquired by the Project. Almost all land to be \nacquired will be agricultural land (48.1 ha), while the rest will be residential land (0.4 ha) \nand government land (0.9 ha). \n3.  A total of 734 project affected persons were identified through the inventory of \nlosses IOL, of which 725 are households and nine are institutions and communes. An \nestimated 369 households will be severely affected by (i) loss of 10% or more of their \nproductive assets (i.e., paddy land) and/or (ii) relocation of houses (21 households). \nTable A12.1: Number of Project Affected Persons \nAffected Persons \nSubprojects  Land Acquisition \n(ha)  Institutions  Households  Total \nRing Belt and Peripheral Roads   14.1   4  326  330 \nWastewater Treatment Pond  20.0  1  179  180 \nVocational College of Industry  7.5  -  161   161 \nInformation Center and Le \u2013 River  7.8  4  59    63 \nTotal  49.4  9  725  734 \nha = hectare. \nSource: Project preparatory technical assistance estimates. \n4.  Legal  and  Policy  Framework.  The  legal  and  policy  framework  for \ncompensation,  resettlement,  and  rehabilitation  under  the  Project  is  defined  by  the \nrelevant  laws  and  regulations  of  the  Government  of  Viet  Nam  and  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) policies. In case of discrepancies between the Borrower\u2019s \nlaws, regulations, and procedures and ADB's policies and requirements, ADB's policies \nand  requirements  will  prevail,  consistent  with  Decree  No.  131/2006/ND-CP  which \nprovides that in case of \u201cdiscrepancy between any provision in an international treaty on \nofficial  development  assistance,  to  which  the  Socialist  Republic  of  Viet  Nam  is  a \nsignatory, and the Vietnamese Law, the provision in the international treaty on ODA shall \ntake precedence\u201d (Article 2, Item 5). \n5.  Project  Objectives,  Compensation,  and  Entitlement  Policy.  The  overall \nobjective of the compensation and entitlement policy for the Project is to ensure that all \npeople affected by the Project will be able to restore their pre-project conditions while the \npoor and vulnerable households will be able to improve their pre-project living standards \nand income-earning capacity through compensation for the loss of physical and non-\nphysical  assets  and,  as  required,  other  assistance  and  rehabilitation  measures. \n ", "Appendix 12  61 \nCompensation  will  be  based  on  the  principle  of  replacement  cost  while  additional \nassistance  in  cash  and  in-kind  will  also  be  provided  depending  on  the  severity  of \nimpacts. Income restoration measures or programs for severely affected and vulnerable \nhouseholds will be designed and implemented in consultation with affected persons \nduring the updating of the resettlement plan (RP). \n6.  Consultations  and  Disclosure.  Prior  to  the  socioeconomic  surveys  and \ninventory of losses surveys being carried out, the affected persons were informed about \nthe proposed Project, potential impacts, RP preparation activities, project entitlements \n(i.e., compensation payment at replacement cost) and the schedule. Copies of a project \ninformation sheet in Vietnamese language were distributed to communes, wards and \naffected persons in July 2008. Meetings were also held and will continue during RP \nupdating in order for affected persons to be provided with additional information about \nthe Project and an opportunity for open discussion about resettlement policies and \nprocedures. \n7.  Ethnicity, Vulnerability, and Gender Issues. All affected households are Kinh. \nThe census identified 112 households that are considered vulnerable households, as the \nhousehold  head  or  members  of  the  household  fell  into  one  or  more  categories  of \nvulnerability: female-headed household, elderly households, and poor households as \ndefined by the Ministry of Invalids and Social Affairs. These vulnerable households will \ntake part in income restoration measures and/or programs under the Project. Separate \nmeetings will be held with them during RP updating and implementation to ensure that \ntheir special needs and concerns are identified and addressed and that restoration or \nimprovement of their socioeconomic conditions will be carefully monitored. \n8.  Implementation Arrangements. The Executing Agency for the Project is the \nThanh  Hoa  Province  (THP)  People\u2019s  Committee  through  the  provincial  project \nmanagement  unit  (PPMU),  with  support  from  the  five  project  implementation  units \n(PIUs). They will draw support from the Thanh Hoa People's Committee, commune \npeople\u2019s  committees,  city  resettlement  committee,  and  the  consulting  team  for  the \nupdating, implementation, and monitoring of the resettlement plan. \n9.  Grievance  Mechanism.  A  well-defined  grievance  redress  and  resolution \nmechanism will be established to address the grievances and complaints of affected \npersons regarding land acquisition, compensation, and resettlement in a timely and \nsatisfactory manner. Affected persons are entitled to lodge complaints regarding any \naspect  of  the  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  requirements,  compensation  policy, \nentitlements,  payment  rates,  and  strategies  and  procedures  for  resettlement  and \nrehabilitation assistance programs. A four-stage procedure for redress of grievances is \nprovided in the main report. \n10.  Monitoring. Regular monitoring will be undertaken by the PPMU and PIUs, and \nthe PPMU will submit quarterly progress reports to ADB. Moreover, an external monitor \nwill also be engaged to carry out its own independent review and assessment of RP \nupdating  and  implementation.  The  external  monitor  will  be  mobilized  prior  to  DMS \nactivities. External monitoring reports will be submitted to the PPMU and ADB on a \nquarterly basis. \n11.   Resettlement Budget. The total budget for updating and implementing this RP \nis  $4.8  million.  This  amount  covers  compensation  and  allowances,  design  and \nimplementation of income restoration measures and programs, administration costs, and \ncontingencies. As the cost of land acquisition and resettlement will be funded under the \nloan, in line with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2007, as amended from time to \n ", "62  Appendix 12 \ntime), a second generation imprest account (SGIA) will be established in the Thanh Hoa \nCity resettlement committee at a commercial bank acceptable to the Government and \nADB. Use of these SGIAs will be limited to PPMU providing funds for payments: (i) to \naffected persons for land and other assets acquired to facilitate the construction of the \nvarious  components,  (ii)  to  affected  persons  for  resettlement  compensation  and \nallowances as set out in the approved updated RP, (iii) for relocation site development \nand the income restoration program, and (iv) for incremental expenses incurred by the \ncity resettlement committee, necessary for the implementation of the approved updated \nRP. \n12.  A qualified appraiser will be hired during RP updating to carry out a replacement \ncost  survey  for  land  and  non-land  assets.  The  rates  established  by  the  qualified \nappraiser  will  be  used  as  basis  for  compensation  payment  by  the  PPMU  and  city \nresettlement committee. The PPMU and city resettlement committee, with the help of \nproject supervision consultants, will set up a system to ensure that channeling of funds is \ndone transparently, efficiently, and effectively, that monitoring is in place, and that timely \nsubmission of resettlement audit reports are met. ADB staff will have the right to conduct \nspot checks or random checks of expenditures covered by the SGIA. Financial and \naudited statements will also be made available to the external monitor. \n13.  Implementation Schedule. The RP will be updated following detailed design. All \nresettlement activities will be coordinated with the civil works schedule. Land acquisition \nand relocation of affected households cannot commence until the updated RP has been \nreviewed and approved by ADB. The PPMU will not allow construction activities in \nspecific sites until all resettlement activities have been satisfactorily completed, agreed-\nupon rehabilitation assistance is in place, and the site is free of all encumbrances. \nTable A12.2: Resettlement Schedule \nActivity  Schedule \nRP preparation  June\u2013August 2008 \nADB approval of draft RP   August 2008 \nRP updatinga   July 2009\u2013December 2009 \nSubmission and ADB approval of updated RP  September 2009\u2013January 2010 \nImplementation of the approved updated RP   October 2009\u2013July 2010 \nInternal monitoring (submission of quarterly progress reports)  July 2009\u2013onwards \nExternal monitoring (intermittent)  July 2009\u2013onwards \nStart of civil works (upon completion of RP implementation)b  November 2009\u2013onwards \nADB = Asian Development Bank, RP = resettlement plan \na RP updating may be carried out by component, depending on the completion of detailed design.  \nb Compensation, clearance of land, and relocation of houses completed but income restoration may still be \nongoing. \nSource: Project preparatory technical assistance estimates.  \n14.  Disclosure  of  Resettlement  Planning  and  Monitoring  Documents.  Key \ninformation in the draft RP were disclosed to affected persons in late August 2008 \nthrough  the  distribution  of  public  information  booklets  translated  into  Vietnamese \nlanguage. Similarly, copies of the RP in Vietnamese are placed in provincial, city and \ncommune/ward offices. Also, the draft RP has been uploaded onto the ADB website. \nFollowing detailed design, the draft and final updated RP will again be disclosed to the \naffected persons and will be uploaded onto the ADB website. \n "], "metadata": {"CreationDate": "D:20090211144410+08'00'", "Creator": "Acrobat PDFMaker 7.0 for Word", "Producer": "Acrobat Elements 7.0 (Windows)", "ModDate": "D:20090310104919+08'00'", "Company": "ADB", "Title": ""}, "author_page": " \n \n \nNOTES \n \n(i)  The fiscal year of the Government ends on 31 December.  \n(ii)  In this report, \"$\" refers to US dollars. \n \nVice-President  C.
