The  Indian  state  of  West\nBengal is strategically located to play a pivotal and\ncatalytic  role  in  promoting  subregional  economic\ncooperation and reducing poverty in the subregion.\nGood  transport  infrastructure  is  recognized  as  a\nprerequisite and foundation on which governments\ncan plan and implement their economic and social\ndevelopment  programs.  The  development  of  the\nWest  Bengal  Corridor  with  the  improvement  of\naccess  and  capacity  will  remove  a  critical\nbottleneck  in  the  movement  of  freight  and\npassengers  from  the  northern  parts  of  West\nBengal;  the  northeastern  states  of  India;  and\nneighboring Bangladesh, Bhutan, and Nepal to the\nports of Kolkata and Haldia.\nClassification Economic growth\nEnvironmental Assessment Category B. An initial environmental examination\nwas  undertaken  and  the  summary  is  a  core\nappendix.\nRationale The north-south transport corridor in West Bengal\n(West Bengal corridor) extends from Haldia port via\nKolkata (also a river port) to the northern parts of\nWest Bengal. In northern West Bengal, the corridor\ndivides into routes to Nepal and Sikkim in the west;\nand Assam, Bhutan, and the northeastern states of\nIndia in the east. Along the corridor, are several\neastward links to Bangladesh. A large portion of the\nWest  Bengal  corridor  and  the  eastward  links  to\nBangladesh  are  in  urgent  need  of  improvement\nfrom the current deteriorated two-lane, intermediate\nlane  and  single-lane  standard.  National  Highway\n(NH) 34, which forms the spine of the transport\nsystem in the corridor, provides the nearest access\nto ports (Kolkata and Haldia) for the northeastern\nstates of India and neighboring Bhutan and Nepal,\nwhich are landlocked. Two state highways provide\nlinks from the border with Bangladesh to the north-\nsouth corridor and the Indian national road network\n(map p.vii). An efficient transport system along the", "iii\nnorth-south corridor will not only provide the basis\nfor economic growth and poverty reduction in West\nBengal, but will also have significant implications\nfor improving subregional economic cooperation by\nincreasing trade and other economic activities. The\nability  of  regions  and  countries  to  grow  rapidly\ndepends on their capacity to link with regional and\nglobal  markets.  Connectivity  through  improved\ntransport  has  important  implications  for  poverty\nreduction by offering new economic opportunities\nthrough  better  market  linkages  and  increased\nemployment possibilities.\nIn  1998,  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)\nprovided  technical  assistance  (TA)  to  assist  the\nGovernment of West Bengal in preparing a strategy\nand  investment  plan  for  the  development  of  the\nnorth-south  corridor.  The  TA  study,  which  was\ncompleted  in  June  2000,  identified  a  number  of\nhigh-priority  multimodal  transport  infrastructure\ncomponents  for  financing  and  implementation\nthrough  a  mixture  of  government  budget  and\npublic-private  partnerships.  The  highest  priority\ncomponent in terms of economic development and\npoverty  reduction  impacts,  strategic  importance,\nand suitability for public funding is the improvement\nof NH 34, which is the artery of the north-south\ntransport corridor, and the eastward connections to\nthe  border  with  Bangladesh.  Two  other  priority\ncomponents, the connections between Haldia and\nKolkata  and  the  national  highway  network,  are\nbeing examined through detailed feasibility studies\nfunded by the National Highways Authority of India\nand will be considered for ADB financing under the\nnext  phase  of  corridor  development.  Meanwhile,\ntwo other corridor sections with potential for private\nparticipation are being developed as public-private\npartnership projects.\nObjectives and Scope The  objective  of  the  Project  is  to  support  the\ndevelopment  of  a  corridor  in  West  Bengal  to\npromote  subregional  economic  activities,  reduce\npoverty,  and  facilitate  trade  by  removing  critical\ncapacity  constraints  and  improving  transport\nefficiency. Because of the strategic location of the\nnorth-south corridor, an improved transport system\nwill  facilitate  subregional  economic  cooperation,\nand enhance the mobility of rural communities, thus\nsupporting  rural  development  and  increasing  the\nearnings of low-income groups.", "iv\nThe Project will (i) enhance access along the north-\nsouth corridor by improving about 370 kilometers\n(km) of NH 34; (ii) upgrade subregional connectivity\nby improving about 150 km of state highways that\nconnect the corridor to the border with Bangladesh;\nand (iii) provide rural communities with access to\nmarkets, schools, hospitals, other social services,\nand  employment  opportunities  by  rehabilitating\nabout 100 km of rural access roads. Through policy\ndialogue carried out during Project processing, a\ncorridor  and  sector  development  framework  was\ndeveloped  to  promote  (i)  sound  corridor\ndevelopment and management practices; and (ii)\nimprove  the  policy  environment  for  the  efficient\ndelivery of transport infrastructure in West Bengal.\nThe Project will also strengthen environmental and\nsocial governance through mitigation measures in\nProject design, construction, and operation.\nCost Estimates\n($ million)\nForeign Local Total\nItem Exchange Currency Cost\nRight-of-Way 0.0 18.6 18.6\nCivial Works 147.4 79.3 226.7\nConsulting Services 12.6 2.9 15.5\nProject Management 0.0 4.6 4.6\nContingencies 26.5 13.6 40.1\nInterest During Construction 17.5 0.0 17.5\nTotal 204.0 119.0 323.0\nFinancing Plan\n($ million)\nForeign Local Total\nSource Exchange Currency Cost Percentage\nADB 204.0 6.0 210.0 65\nGovernment 0.0 113.0 113.0 35\nTotal 204.0 119.0 323.0 100\nADB = Asian Development Bank.\nLoan Amount and Terms A loan of $210 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital\nresources  will  be  provided  under  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-\nbased loan facility.

I submit for your approval the following Report and Recommendation on a proposed loan\nto India for the West Bengal Corridor Development Project.\nII. INTRODUCTION\n2. The north-south corridor in West Bengal (West Bengal Corridor), which extends from\nHaldia port off the Bay of Bengal via Kolkata to the northern parts of West Bengal, provides the\nmajor trade access to India\u2019s northeastern states and to neighboring Bhutan and Nepal. In 1998,\nthe Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided technical assistance (TA)1 to assist the Government\nof West Bengal (GWB) to prepare a strategy and investment plan for developing a north-south\ncorridor.  The  TA  study,  which  was  completed  in  June  2000,  identified  and  prioritized  the\nimprovement  of  multimodal  transport  infrastructure.  During  the  2000  Country  Programming\nMission, the Government requested ADB assistance to develop the corridor in West Bengal.\nProject preparation work on the highest priority components of the corridor was carried out under\nthree ADB small-scale TAs.2 In April 2001, the ADB Fact-Finding Mission3 formulated the Project\non the basis of discussions with the Government, other agencies active in the road sector, and the\nproject preparation reports. The Appraisal Mission completed the review of all aspects of the\nProject and the sector in July 2001. Loan negotiations with Government representatives were held\nin Manila from 12 to 14 November 2001. The project framework is in Appendix 1.\nIII.  BACKGROUND\nA. Sector Description\n1.  West Bengal Corridor\na. Transport System\n3. The West Bengal corridor extends from Haldia port via Kolkata to the northern parts of\nWest Bengal. In the Shiliguri area, the transport network divides into routes westward to Nepal,\nDarjiling (in West Bengal), and Sikkim; and eastward to Bhutan, and Assam, to the other north-\neastern states of India, namely, Arunchal Pradesh, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, and\nTripura. The corridor also has links with Bangladesh; Nepal-Bangladesh and Bhutan-Bangladesh\ntraffic crosses the east-west routes. The West Bengal corridor can be divided into two distinct but\nrelated sections: namely, (i) Kolkata-Shiliguri, and (ii) Haldia-Kolkata. National Highway (NH) 34 is\nthe main road transport link, connecting the outskirts of Kolkata to Dalkhola at the intersection\nwith NH 31, some 453 kilometers (km) north of Kolkata. NH 31 in turn leads to Shiliguri. NH 34\nparallels the east bank of the Hugli river (the lowest reach of the River Ganga), passes through\nKrishnanagar and Baharampur, and crosses the River Ganga at the Farakka Barrage. From\nFarakka, the road continues via Maldah and Raiganj to Dalkhola. Both NH 34 and NH 31 are\n                  \n1 TA 3142-IND: North-South Corridor Development Project in West Bengal, for $1.0 million, approved on 23 December\n1998.\n2 TA 3538-IND: Preliminary Engineering for the West Bengal Corridor Development Project, for $150,000, approved on\n13 November 2000; TA 3539-IND: Resettlement and Environmental Assessment for the West Bengal Corridor\nDevelopment Project, for $150,000, approved on 13 November 2000; TA 3540-IND: Economic and Poverty Analysis\nfor the West Bengal Corridor Development Project, for $150,000, approved on 13 November 2000.\n3 The project processing team comprised T. Kandiah, Senior Investment/Programs Officer, India Resident Mission\n(INRM)  and  Mission  Leader;  P.  Vallely,  Transport  Specialist;  A.  Goswami,  Counsel;  R.  Jayewardene,  Social\nDevelopment Specialist; Yue-Lang Feng, Environment Specialist; and H. Mukhopadhyay, Macroeconomist (INRM).", "2\npredominantly  two-lane  with  unpaved  shoulders  and  are  heavily  congested  with  frequent\naccidents and delays. Pedestrians, animal carts, and two- and three-wheeled traffic occupy the\nmain carriageway rather than using the unpaved shoulders; bypasses of towns and villages are\nrare. Sections of NH 34 are subject to closure for long periods due to flooding in the rainy season.\nBetween Haldia and Kolkata, a distance of 62 km, three modes of transport are available: road,\nrail, and inland waterway. The main road link from Haldia to Kolkata is indirect, via the two-lane\nNH 41 between Haldia and Kolaghat, and then by NH 6, also two-lane, to the junction of the Kona\nExpressway, a distance of about 120 km.\n4. TA 3142 (footnote 1) identified a number of high priority multimodal transport infrastructure\nimprovements to be implemented in a phased manner over a 5- to 10-year time frame (Appendix\n2). The infrastructure improvements are proposed for financing using a mixture of public funds\nand public-private partnerships. The most critical components of the transport system in the\ncorridor identified are the improvement and partial rehabilitation of NH 34, and the construction of\nconnectors linking Haldia to Kolkata and the national highway network. The improvement and\npartial rehabilitation of NH 34 was proposed as the component requiring immediate attention\nbecause of its (i) strategic importance as the spine of the transport system, (ii) high social and\neconomic development impact, (iii) preparedness for implementation with relatively minor land\nacquisition and resettlement impacts, and (iv) unsuitability for private financing. Detailed feasibility\nstudies on the connectors between Haldia and Kolkata (which will be on new alignments) and the\nnational highway network, are ongoing with funding from the National Highways Authority of India\n(NHAI). Once these studies are completed, the need for ADB financing will be examined, together\nwith financing from other development agencies active in the road sector in India and private\nparticipation.\nb.  Economic Centers in the Corridor\n5. Haldia. A major port, Haldia has an existing industrial base that has accompanied the port\ndevelopment since the late 1980s. Haldia is rapidly growing into one of the major industrial\ncenters of eastern India, with an expanding manufacturing base and an oil refinery. Production\nfrom  a  large,  recently  commissioned,  petrochemical  plant  will  generate  many  downstream\nindustries, which will be located in Haldia or elsewhere in West Bengal. Haldia port handles about\n14 million tons of imports and 7 million tons of exports.\n6. Between Haldia and Kolkata. Incentives include duty-free imports of machinery and raw\nmaterials, exemptions from excise duty, reimbursement of sales tax, private bonded warehousing,\nsimplified  customs  procedures,  and  concessional  lease  rents.  The  GWB  has  provided  the\nindustrial and social infrastucture for an export processing zone, about 55 km south of Kolkata.\n7. Kolkata. A river port, Kolkata is one of the major industrial and trading cities of India. The\nCalcutta Metropolitan Area dominates the industrial scene of the state of West Bengal. The main\nindustries  are  casting  and  forging  iron  and  steel,  copper,  brass,  aluminium,  zinc,  fertilizers,\npesticides, manufacture of paper and paper products, and basic and heavy inorganic chemicals.\nThe industrial pattern is dominated by steel- and coal-based industries; jute mills and cotton\ntextiles are also major industries. The Calcutta Metropolitan authority is proposing to create a light\nindustries township over 405 hectres (ha) in the Salt Lake-Rajarhat belt (north of Kolkata) with\nprivate participation.", "3\n8. Kolkata to Shiliguri. A distance of about 550 km, this area is largely rural with agriculture\nand agroprocessing the main economic activities, apart from the Kalyani industrial area located\n55 km north of Kolkata. Agricultural productivity in West Bengal has increased substantially. To\nsustain this growth, a continuous supply of material inputs especially from urban centers to the\nrural areas is essential; as is a transport linkage between rural and urban areas, and between\nfarm and consumer or processing plants for production and distribution of agricultural products.\nThe movement of this traffic along the north-south axis of West Bengal must be maintained to\nenable continuing economic growth. Barasat is known for its manufacturing plants for edible oils,\nweaving of cotton textiles, and spinning and weaving of jute-related products. Maldah district\nproduces rice, jute, wheat, and fruit; while Dinajpur district produces rice; jute; maize; rape seed;\nmustard; sugarcane; and temperate crops such as pulses, tobacco, chillies, and vegetables.\n9. Shiliguri. Located in Darjiling district, Shiliguri is the main trade and commercial center of\nthe north of West Bengal. Tea from Darjiling, Dooars, and Assam; crude oil from the Assamese oil\nfields to various refineries; fruits and flowers grown in Darjiling district; tourist traffic to Sikkim,\nBhutan,  and  the  northeast  are  all  routed  through  Shiliguri.  Industries  include  a  plant\nmanufacturing distilled fatty-acid glycerol. Food processing, leather, paper, dairy, tea, horticulture,\nand floriculture could be developed.\n10. The economic potential of the corridor should be developed fully so that the corridor\nbecomes an area of economic activity, which will create jobs and help reduce poverty, instead of\nmerely serving as a transport corridor connecting the landlocked northeastern states of India and\nthe neighboring countries to the ports in the Bay of Bengal. The development of an economic\ncorridor requires a holistic approach to planning, cutting across many sectors and involving a wide\nrange of stakeholders. A framework for the economic corridor is being developed to (i) define the\ngeographic coverage of the corridor; (ii) identify priority projects, policies, and institutions; (iii)\nquantify the resources required and sources of financing; and, (iv) clarify the roles of the public\nand private sectors in corridor development.\n2. Subregional Cooperation\n11. ADB\u2019s support for subregional cooperation in eastern South Asia has focused mainly on\ncooperation between Bangladesh, Bhutan, India (especially east and northeastern India), and\nNepal. The subregion is home to about half a billion people and is among the poorest regions in\nthe world. Nonetheless, the subregion offers a large hardworking workforce at relatively low\nwages.  With  suitable  investment  to  develop  skills,  this  workforce  could  provide  a  major\ncompetitive advantage. In December 1996, the four countries launched the South Asia Growth\nQuadrangle, which the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation subsequently endorsed\nas a subregional initiative. The South Asia Growth Quadrangle countries have selected Nepal as\nthe  coordinating  country  and  assigned  the  following  sector  responsibilities:  Bangladesh  for\nenergy; Bhutan for environment; India for trade and investment, and Nepal for transport and\ntourism. In addition to the official (Track I) activities, non-official (Track II) initiatives are being\nundertaken to promote subregional cooperation.\n12. In November 2000, under an ADB small-scale regional TA,4 the first meeting of the\nPrivate Sector Forum on Economic Cooperation in the Eastern South Asia Subregion5 was held\n                  \n4 TA 5890-REG: First Meeting of the Private Sector Forum on Economic Cooperation in the Eastern South Asia\nSubregion, for $30,000, approved on 23 December 1999.\n5  Consisting of Bangladesh, Bhutan, Nepal, and the Indian states of, Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Bihar, Manipur,\nMeghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, Sikkim, Tripura, and West Bengal.", "4\nin  Kolkata  as  a  Track  II  initiative.  The  meeting  provided  a  forum  for  officials  representing\ngovernment, and chambers of commerce and industry from the four countries, and the private\nsector  to  explore  opportunities  for  cooperation  in  energy,  transport,  tourism,  and  trade  and\ninvestment. An investment program for the subregion would include an economic corridor around\nthe Bay of Bengal, linking the ports of Chittagong, Dhaka, Haldia, Kolkata, and Mongla. It would\nalso include a transport grid of highways, rail and inland waterways linking Bhutan, Nepal, and the\nnortheastern states of India to the ports in the Bay of Bengal through Bangladesh and West\nBengal. Similar grids could be developed for power, hydrocarbons and telecommunications. In\nSeptember 2000, ADB provided TA6 to assist Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, and Nepal to identify\npotential subregional programs and projects that have cross-border benefits, and address key\ncross-border coordination issues that may arise at the project level. The main sectors covered by\nthe TA include (i) energy and power, (ii) environment, (iii) trade investment and the private sector,\n(iv)  transportation,  and  (v)  tourism.  The  ongoing  activities  include  identifying  both  physical\ninvestments and nonphysical barriers to creating an enabling environment for trade.\n13. The project corridor is an important subregional artery because West Bengal borders\nBangladesh to the east; Nepal to the northwest; Bhutan to the northeast; and the states of Bihar,\nJharkand, and Orissa to the west; Sikkim to the north; and Assam to the east. Traffic from India\u2019s\nnortheastern states must pass through West Bengal to reach an Indian port. The existing NH 31C\nconnects Shiliguri with Banitanki at the Nepal border and with Phuntsholing in Bhutan. Fourteen\nland-border crossing points have been designated between West Bengal and Bangladesh, nine\nfor road, three for rail, and two for inland waterways. Most of the road crossings are at Petrapole-\nBenapole near Bangaon and at Hilli. State highways (SH 1 and SH 10) connect Bangaon and Hilli\nto the project corridor.\n14. Improvements to transport infrastructure with subregional cooperation implications must\nbe accompanied with measures to reduce or remove the nonphysical barriers to the efficient\nmovement of goods and people. This includes measures such as allowing freight trucks access\nacross  borders,  streamlining  cross-border  inspection  procedures  and  working  hours,  and\nsimplifying documentation requirements. A bilateral agreement for a direct Kolkata-Dhaka bus\nservice has been implemented with two return services operating daily through Petropole. The\nrailway route to Bangladesh through Petropole reopened to freight traffic in January 2001. The\nissue  of  facilitating  the  movement  of  goods  and  people  across  borders  through  bilateral\nagreements and a framework agreement for all four eastern South Asian countries (Bangladesh,\nBhutan, India, and Nepal) is being addressed by the Transport Group under the ADB TA 5936\n(footnote 6), which had its first meeting in Kathmandu in October 2001. The participating countries\nidentified  various  institutional/procedural  reform  projects  such  as  (i)  a  review  of  existing\nnonphysical barriers to the movement of goods and people across borders; (ii) development of an\naction plan to prepare bilateral and quadilateral framework agreements; and (iii) standardization\nof  road  safety,  traffic  and  transport  regulations  in  the  subregion.  These  initiatives  will  be\naddressed during the second phase of the TA, which is currently being processed.\na. Road Network and Administration in West Bengal\n15. Road transport is the dominant mode of transport in the state of West Bengal. The state\nhas a primary network of about 17,623 km of roads consisting of 1,966 km of national highways\n(10 percent of the network length), 3,388 km of state highways (20 percent), 5,833 km of major\ndistrict roads (33 percent), and 6,436 km of other district roads (37 percent). About 95 percent of\n                  \n6  TA 5936-REG: Identification and Prioritization of Subregional Projects in South Asia, for $785,000, approved on\n2000.", "5\nthe primary network is paved. The state also has a village and urban road network of about\n35,600  km,  but  only  about  47  percent  of  the  villages  in  the  state  (of  38,000  villages)  are\nconnected by roads. In the past, the state invested more heavily on extending the rural road\nnetwork (major and other district roads) than the state highways, resulting in the length of major\nand other district roads growing at almost twice the pace of state highways. Almost all of the\nprimary network was constructed before the 1980s. The network has been extended marginally,\nby less than 400 km, since 1981.\n16. In contrast, demand for road transport has been increasing rapidly at an annual rate of\nabout 11 percent since the early 1980s, largely outpacing the capacity expansion of the road\nnetwork in the state. In addition, most of the primary network comprises single-lane (about 45\npercent) or intermediate-lane (about 45 percent) roads with limited capacity and poor riding\nquality. The mismatch of demand and supply of road transport has resulted in road infrastructure\nbecoming one of the key constraints to the social and economic development of the state.\n17. The capacity constraint of the road network has been exacerbated by inadequate attention\nto, and funding for, network maintenance, which has in turn hastened the deterioration of the state\nroad system. Funding for road maintenance has been less than 50 percent of the requirement as\nper  Finance  Commission-recommended  norms  in  the  last  decade.  The  funding  gap  for\nmaintenance needs to be progressively reduced and an effective road management system\ndeveloped to maintain the existing road assets.\n18. The primary road network is administered by the West Bengal Public Works (Roads)\nDepartment (WBPWRD), which oversees planning, design, construction, and maintenance of all\nstate roads, bridges, and buildings, as well as the construction and maintenance of national\nhighways on behalf of the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways (MORTH). Since its creation,\nWBPWRD has enjoyed a monopoly for the providing engineering, construction supervision, and\nmaintenance services.\nb. Road Transport Industry in West Bengal\n19. The trucking industry carries over 70 percent of the total freight traffic. The industry is\ndominated by small operators: 77 percent own a small fleet of up to 5 trucks; the majority own\nonly one truck. They are primarily engaged in the haulage of freight and are dependent on\nbrokers and booking agents for business. Only about 6 percent of the trucks are owned by\ncompanies with a fleet of 20 or more. Due to the fragmented nature of the industry, system output\nhas suffered for lack of economies of scale.\n20. Entry into and exit from the trucking industry is easy; no registration scheme is in place for\ntransport operators. Large transport companies are registered under the Partnership Act or the\nCompanies Act. The Motor Vehicle Act 1988, only mandates owners to register vehicles and\nobtain a permit for their operations. Permits are liberally issued, almost on request.\n21. The freight rate structure for road transport is determined at different levels. The transport\ncontractors or the booking agent quote and settle freight rates with the consignors. These rates\nare negotiated and are valid for a given time period. The truck owners depend on brokers, who\nhave day-to-day arrangements with them, for obtaining goods to be transported. The brokers\narrange the goods for the truck owners from the booking agents at the prevailing market rates;\nand charge a brokerage fee, which ranges from Rs200 to Rs400 per vehicle trip.", "6\n22. Public  transport  is  undertaken  by  state  transport  corporations  (STCs)  and  private\noperators. West Bengal has five STCs:, (i) North Bengal STC, (ii) South Bengal STC, (iii) West\nBengal STC, (iv) Calcutta STC, and (v) Calcutta Tramways Company. In 2001, the STCs owned\nwas approximately 2,800 buses, approximately 12 percent of the total West Bengal bus fleet of\n23,000. Private bus companies have their own operators associations and bus workers unions.\nEntry into public transport operations for private companies or individuals consists of applying for\na  route  license  to  either  the  regional  transport  authority  of  the  district  where  operation  is\nrequested or to the State Transport Authority if operation is to cover several districts and regions.\nThe tariff structure of public transport services is fixed by the state, i.e, the State Transport\nAuthority,  which  reviews  the  fare  structure  from  time  to  time,  and  make  adjustments  as\nnecessary. Operators on the same route charge the same fare.\nB. Government Policies and Plans\n23. The  Government\u2019s  strategy  for  the  road  sector  under  its  Ninth  Five-Year  Plan\n(FY1997/2002) is to improve the quality of the national highway network to provide safe, efficient,\nand economic carriage of goods and people. The road network also needs to be expanded and\nstrengthened to improve accessibility of the hinterland, especially the rural areas, and to facilitate\nthe integration of isolated parts of the country. In December 1998, the Government announced\nthe  National  Highway  Development  Program  as  a  national  priority,  which  includes  the\nquadrilateral corridors connecting Chennai, Delhi, Kolkata, and Mumbai, as well as north-south\nand east-west national corridors.\n24. GWB has given high priority to transport development in the state and particularly the\nnorth-south  corridor  in  West  Bengal.  In  March  1999,  the  GWB  set  up  the  Task  Force  on\nInfrastructure with Special Emphasis on Roads under the Commerce and Industries Department.\nThe state's priorities for roads during the ninth and tenth plan periods (1997/2007) are to (i)\nreplace  level  crossings  on  heavily  utilized  railways;  (ii)  construct  bypasses  of  all  district\nheadquarters;  (iii)  rehabilitate  half  of  the  weak/narrow  bridges  with  heavy  traffic;  (iv)\nwiden/strengthen half of the state highways as required; (v) construct all missing links in the state\nhighway network; (vi) construct expressways from major industrial centrers/ports to Kolkata; and\n(vii) maintain all-weather connections to all villages with populations over 1,000 and half of the\nvillages with population of 500-1,000.\nC. External Assistance to the Sector\n25. Since 1988, ADB has extended five loans7 totaling $1,113 million, one TA loan8 for $12.7\nmillion, and 20 TAs totalling $7.925 million to India\u2019s road sector. Apart from ADB, the World\nBank and the Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC)9 are also involved in the road\nsector. The World Bank has provided financing for nine projects amounting to about $1,900\nmillion to construct and rehabilitate rural roads, improve state highways, and widen national\nhighways to four lanes. JBIC has provided five loans amounting to $263 million equivalent to\n                  \n7  Loan 0918-IND: Road Improvement Project, for $198 million, approved on 10 November 1988. Loan 1041-IND:\nSecond Road Project, for $250 million, approved on 30 October 1990. Loan 1274-IND: National Highways Project, for\n$245 million, approved on 29 November 1993. Loan 1747-IND: Surat-Manor Tollway Project, for $180 million,\napproved on 27 July 2000. Loan 1839-IND: Western Transport Corridor Project, for $240 million, approved on 20\nSeptember 2001.\n8 Loan 1279-IND: Bombay-Vadodara Expressway Technical Assistance Project, for $12.7 million, approved on 2\nDecember 1993.\n9  The work was initially supported by the Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund of Japan, which was merged with the\nJapan Export-Import Bank on 1 October 1999 to form JBIC.", "7\nupgrade NH 2 and NH 5 to four lanes, and to construct a bridge across the Yamuna River at\nAllahabad-Naini. ADB\u2019s assistance to the road sector is well coordinated with the World Bank and\nJBIC through regular consultations. A coordinated assistance strategy for the road sector in India\nis being prepared in consultation with the Government, World Bank, and other financing agencies.\nDetails of external assistance to the road sector in India are given in Appendix 3.\nD. Lessons Learned\n26. ADB\u2019s  second  loan  project,  Loan  1041-IND  (footnote  7)  included  a  component  to\nstrengthen and widen about 150 km of the state highway from Panagarh to Moregram in West\nBengal. The project experienced long delays. Preconstruction activities relating to the recruitment\nof supervision consultants and the procurement of civil works were delayed. Further delays were\nexperienced during construction because of (i) inadequacy in the original survey, design, and\ndrawings; (ii) delayed land acquisition, clearance of trees and utilities resulting in nonavailability of\ncontinuous unencumbered sites for the contractor\u2019s use; (iii) poor contract management, and (iv)\nunusual weather conditions. The project was completed in December 1999. ADB\u2019s third project,\nLoan 1274-IND (footnote 7), included the improvement of about 42 km of national highway in\nWest Bengal between Panagarh and Raniganj. The third project also experienced start-up delays.\nThe award of civil works contracts was delayed because of litigation by some unsuccessful\nbidders. When the contracts were eventually awarded, the project sites were not cleared of\nutilities and trees for the contractors to commence work immediately. After these initial delays,\nconstruction work is now progressing well with completion expected in December 2001.\n27. Careful attention has been paid to overcoming the shortcomings of previous ADB projects\nin the road sector by developing the following project implementation arrangements: (i) start-up\ndelays  will  be  reduced  by  approving  advance  action  for  the  procurement  of  the  civil  works\ncontracts and the recruitment of supervision consultants; (ii) land acquisition and the clearance of\ntrees and utilities from the right-of way will be a condition for contract award; (iii) ambiguities in the\ntender documents, which led to court actions under ADB\u2019s third project, will be removed through\nthe mandatory use of ADB\u2019s standard bidding documents; and (iv) the prequalification criteria will\nbe  tightened,  and  the  contract  package  size  made  large  enough  to  attract  experienced\ncontractors.\nE.  ADB\u2019s Sector Strategy\n28. ADB\u2019s sector strategy is to reduce road infrastructure bottlenecks on the key transport\ncorridors  to  support  India\u2019s  efforts  to  achieve  higher  sustainable  economic  growth.  ADB\u2019s\napproach is to promote efficiency in the delivery and maintenance of road infrastructure through\nappropriate policy measures and maximizing, where feasible, private participation. Within this\nstrategy, ADB involvement in the road sector will focus on projects that have significant direct and\nindirect impacts on poverty reduction, facilitate subregional economic cooperation, and promote\nprivate sector development. The sector strategy supports ADB\u2019s operational strategy for India.\nADB\u2019s current assistance for the Government\u2019s National Highway Development Plan focuses on\nthe western transport corridor, comprising NH 8 (Delhi-Jaipur-Ahmedabad-Mumbai) and NH 4\n(Mumbai-Bangalore-Chennai).  The  other  five  major  road  transport  corridors  (Delhi-Kolkata,\nMumbai-Nagpur-Kolkata, Delhi-Nagpur-Bangalore, Kolkata-Chennai, and Chennai-Madurai) are\nbeing developed with assistance from the World Bank and JBIC. The next phase of ADB\u2019s\nassistance for the national plan will be determined in consultation with the Government and the\nother major development agencies. Given the potentially large funding requirements over the\nmedium  to  long  term,  ADB  has  adopted  a  programmatic  approach  under  which  investment", "8\nprojects  will  have  accompanying  policy  components  to  improve  the  road  sector  policy\nenvironment in a coherent, progressive and sequential manner.\nF. Policy Dialogue\n29. Since 1988, ADB has conducted policy dialogue with the Government on various major\nroad sector issues. ADB\u2019s involvement in the road sector has resulted in (i) increased attention to\nroad maintenance; (ii) improved design, construction, and contract management standards, now\nat international practice levels; (iii) improved road safety and environmental impact awareness;\n(iv) establishment of NHAI as a single autonomous agency responsible for the development,\nmaintenance,  and  management  of  the  national  highway  and  expressway  network;  and  (v)\ninitiatives to increase private participation. While significant policy and institutional progress has\nbeen made, ADB is continuing its dialogue with MORTH and NHAI on national road sector issues\nsuch as (i) establishment of a medium- to long-term vision for NHAI, (ii) improved efficiency and\neffectiveness of highway maintenance, and (iii) road safety.\n30. During project processing, a corridor and sector development framework was developed in\nconsultation with GWB to improve the policy environment for the efficient delivery of transport\ninfrastructure in West Bengal. A description of the main elements of the policy framework follows.\n1.  WBPWRD Organizational and Financial Reform\n31. The general condition of roads in West Bengal is not satisfactory and per capita road\nlength  is  much  below  the  country  average.  The  vehicle  population  in  the  state  has  been\nincreasing at an average of 11 percent over the last few years; the rate of traffic growth is\nexpected to rise along with increasing industrialization and development activities in the coming\nyears. Therefore widening, strengthening, and upgrading of the road network, which is suffering\nfrom capacity and strength constraints, have become urgently necessary. GWB will require a\nmodern, effective, and efficient institutional and financial structure to successfully manage the\nstate\u2019s road network and road infrastructure.\n32. With assistance from the World Bank\u2019s TA loan facility, GWB is  reviewing the state\u2019s\ncurrent institutional and financial structures to develop an institutional development strategy for\nWBPWRD. The objective of the institutional review is to establish a strategy for sustainable\nimprovement of West Bengal\u2019s institutional framework, which will enlarge and improve the state\u2019s\ntechnical and financing capacity to effectively and efficiently manage the West Bengal road\ntransport network and related infrastructure, and also meet the transport demands of its users.\nThe institutional development strategy will enable GWB to\n(i)  promote  a  more  rational  and  efficient  approach  to  road  investment  planning,\nmaintenance, and funding at the state level;\n(ii)  improve the institutional capacity in the sector through a comprehensive revision of\nthe focus, organization, technical skills, and resourcing of the main GWB road\ndevelopment and maintenance bodies;\n(iii)  improve resource mobilization in the sector through state and user\u2019s funding to\nensure the sustainability of the state highway and major district road network;", "9\n(iv)  upgrade the capacity of the private engineering and construction industry to meet\ngrowing demand for high-quality highway engineering and construction services;\nand\n(v) improve the riding quality and capacity of selected congested segments of state\nhighways and major district roads to reduce vehicle operating costs, travel time,\naccidents, and pollution.\n33. The study will assess all relevant aspects of the state\u2019s road infrastructure and develop\nstrategies encompassing the specific aims, measures, and interventions needed to achieve the\nmedium- to long-term, institutional, technical, human resources, and financial enhancements in\nthe GWB road transport infrastructure framework. The study will also consider the existing legal\nand policy frameworks, and propose changes that can be made within these frameworks, or\nidentify realistic amendments than can be made to these frameworks to provide an enabling\nenvironment for the proposed changes. The final institutional development strategy report will\ninclude the necessary transitional strategy(ies),including\n(i) development  of  specific  action  plans  for  any  transformation(s)  of  GWB\u2019s\ninstitutional structure(s) and responsibilities for road transport;\n(ii) detailed financial and strategic planning for initiating new financing and/or revenue\ncollection mechanisms for West Bengal road network funding needs;\n(iii) preimplementation  planning  for  the  organizational,  administrative,  and  financial\naspects of any proposed new structure(s);\n(iv) identification of needs for enhanced/new systems, processes, technologies, and\nresources,  particularly  in  relation  to  financial  management  and  accounting,\ninformation technology/system, procurement and contract administration, technical\nplanning, quality assurance, and project management; and\n(v) assistance  with  implementing  new  approaches,  systems,  and  process;  and\nintroducing appropriate long-term training programs for the organization(s) and\nstaff concerned.\n2. Road Financing\n34. Funds  are  allocated  for  specific  road  works  in  the  following  manner:  (i)  cyclically\ndetermined five-year state plan allocations for new works with annual allocations for specific\nprojects, (ii) annual recurrent or nonplan budget allocations for maintenance and administration of\nexisting infrastructure, and (iii) central plan allocations for selected capital expenditures from\ncentral revenues. Some additional revenues derive from state levies on fuels, licensing, and\nvarious other user aspects of activities for West Bengal road transport. However, these revenues\ntypically accrue to the state\u2019s general revenue rather than for direct application to road needs. The\ncombination of the central plan allocations and plan provisions from the state\u2019s budget has helped\nthe development of a vast road network in the state. This has increased expectations, and liability\nfor  road  maintenance  requirements,  which  by  and  large,  have  been  underfunded  due  to\ncompeting demands on resources from other sectors.", "10\n35. As  a  result  of  this  funding  shortfall,  the  state\u2019s  road  assets  markedly  deteriorated.\nUnusually heavy traffic growth and increased maintenance requirements are the major factors\ncontributing to the greatly increased need for road investment in West Bengal. Any move to\nsignificantly increase GWB funding allocations from its own resources for the state\u2019s road network\nwould not be possible owing to other competing demands for development for other sectors in the\noverall GWB budget funding context. Accordingly, the growing financial needs for both proper\nongoing  maintenance  and  new  investments  in  West  Bengal  road  infrastructure  require  new\nsources of such finance to be developed, with appropriate institutional measures.\n36. The Central Road Fund Ordinance 2000 provides statutory effect to the nonlapsable\nCentral Road Fund. The fund\u2019s revenue is earmarked for specific transport uses. Proceeds are\nallocated to each state in proportion to its fuel consumption (60 percent) and area (40 percent).\nThe fund is financed primarily by a Re1 per liter tax on petrol and high-speed diesel fuel, which\nhave  been  levied  since  June  1998  and  March  1999  respectively.  About  Rs60  billion  was\ngenerated from this source up to 31 March 2000. The petrol tax and Re0.5 of the diesel tax is to\nbe applied on the following basis: 57.5 percent for the National Highway Development Project\nbeing undertaken by NHAI, 27 percent for state highways, 3 percent for roads of interstate and\neconomic importance, and 12.5 percent for railway overpasses. Re0.5 of the diesel assessment is\nfor use in the rural connectivity program. Other potential revenue sources for the road fund\ninclude service taxes on road transport, user fees for overpasses and registration and license\nfees.\n37. At  the  state  level,  Andhra  Pradesh,  Tamil  Nadu,  and  Uttar  Pradesh  have  made\nconsiderable progress in moving toward setting up state road funds. The broad guiding principle\nof the state road fund is that it should be dedicated, sustainable, and professionally managed with\na proper legal framework. The objectives of the state road fund will be to\n(i)  bridge the resource gap, and accelerate improvement and maintenance of state\nroads;\n(ii)  influence  investments  in  the  road  sector  through  long-term  plans  and  annual\nprograms;\n(iii)  leverage fund availability in conjunction with the private sector;\n(iv)  provide funds for project development activities, including projects for multilateral\nand private financing; and\n(v)  fund institutional capacity building, including training.\n38. The potential revenue sources for the state road fund will be transfers from the Central\nRoad Fund; additional levy of Re1.00 per liter on petrol and Re0.50 per liter on diesel, sales tax\non fuel, and vehicle road tax. The state road fund should (i) be managed by an autonomous board\nwith  representation  of  all  stakeholders  (government,  automobile  associations,  bus  and  truck\noperators, financial institutions, chambers of commerce, and nongovernment organizations); and\n(ii) include a public consultation process and independent audit arrangements.", "11\n39. To improve the current road financing position, GWB needs to prepare a comprehensive,\nfully integrated road infrastructure development strategy that will take into account consultations\non the needs and priorities of the sector with all the major groups and organizations involved in\nthe road sector, and will include a viable action plan for immediate and continuing measures to\nimprove maintenance of the state road network, and a road financing master plan that will include\noptions for increased financing, including a state road fund.\n3. Corridor Management and Transport Development in West Bengal\n40. GWB  established  the  North-South  Economic  Corridor  Board  through  a  Government\nresolution in April 2000.  The Project Board has the Chief Secretary of GWB as Chair, and\nrepresentation from various relevant departments (such as home, finance, transport, public works,\nland, commerce and industry, and power as members). The board also has representation from\nWest Bengal Industrial Development Corporation; IWIN (a joint venture between WBIDC and\nICICI); Calcutta Port Trust; NHAI and MORTH. The board, however, does not have a clearly\ndocumented mandate and constitution, and all its members including the member convenor (who\nis also the project director) are part-time members who have full-time responsibilities in their own\ndepartments or organizations. While the seniority of the members of the board clearly makes it\nappropriate for taking policy decisions, it is not suitable for involving itself in coordination or\noperational matters. In addition, the Board\u2019s scope needs to be extended to include all land\ntransport matters in West Bengal. The development of transport infrastructure in the West Bengal\nCorridor and across West Bengal requires multisectoral consultation and coordination.\n41. The North-South Economic Corridor Board needs to be reconstituted, to clearly identify its\nrole and responsibilities, and to expand its coverage to all land transport development. The salient\nfeatures of the proposed reconstituted board or standing committee include the following:\n(i)  The board or standing committee will comprise the chief secretary as chair, and\nrepresentatives of the road and rail transport authorities, finance, commerce, and\nindustry departments; and should meet quarterly.\n(ii)  An  executive  committee  or  secretariat,  to  be  constituted  within  an  existing\ndepartment to be responsible for implementing the board or standing committee\nresolutions,  will  translate  the  policies  into  specific  project  strategies  or  project\ncomponent strategies relating to the development of transport infrastructure in\nWest Bengal in general and the West Bengal Corridor in particular.\n(iii)  Project implementation will be the responsibility of either the private sector or\nWBPWD through private contractors if the project component is publicly funded.\n(iv)  The board or standing committee will get specialist advice on all matters relating to\nprivate participation.\n4. Private Sector Development\n42. Private sector participation in infrastructure in West Bengal is relatively undeveloped. The\nWest  Bengal  Industrial  Development  Corporation  is  the  lead  agency  promoting  private\nparticipation in industry and infrastructure in West Bengal. In June 1997, IWIN started operations\nto  promote  and  facilitate  the  development  of  the  state\u2019s  infrastructure  through  private\nparticipation. The West Bengal Transport Infrastructure Development Corporation commenced", "12\noperations in 1998 to develop transport schemes on a commercial basis. The first build-operate-\ntransfer project in West Bengal, the Vivekananda Flyover in Kolkata, has been tendered.\n43. Private sector participation involves balancing the interest of government, users, and the\nprivate entity. The existing West Bengal statutory and regulatory setup is not conducive to the\ncomplex contractual agreements required for private participation. Therefore a private sector\nparticipation  framework  is  needed  to  facilitate  private  sector  financing  of  infrastructure.  The\ndevelopment of the private participation enabling framework would require the following phased\nand sequential actions:\n(i)  establish a policy framework so that the Government can evolve clear objectives\nand goals;\n(ii)  amend existing legislation or proposals for new legislation using a time-bound\nprogram  to  remove  obstacles  to  cost-effective  private  sector  participation\narrangements;\n(iii)  enhance the capacity of various Government departments, to participate effectively\nin promoting and developing private sector participation;\n(iv)  provide an effective institutional framework to implement the program;\n(v)  extend private sector participation to other infrastructure sectors, based on the\nlearning experience of the North-South Corridor Project;\n(vi)  enact the West Bengal Infrastructure Development Act governing private sector\nparticipation in the development of all forms of infrastructure projects; and\n(vii)  set up of regulatory authorities to oversee tariff setting, investments, competition,\nand service levels. The regulatory authorities can be sector specific.\n44. TA 3142 (footnote 1) identified a number of projects in the West Bengal corridor with the\npotential for private participation. Two of these are the Haldia-Uluberiya expressway and Raiganj-\nIslampur cutoff. The development of these projects as public-private partnerships will provide\nvaluable lessons in private sector participation, and if successful, will serve as a model for\nreplication elsewhere in the state and for other forms of infrastructure.\nIV. THE PROPOSED PROJECT\nA.  Rationale\n45. Good transport infrastructure is recognized as a prerequisite and foundation on which\ngovernments can plan and implement their economic and social development programs. The\ndevelopment of the West Bengal Corridor with the improvement of access and capacity will\nremove a critical bottleneck in the movement of freight and passengers from the northern parts of\nWest Bengal, the northeastern states of India, and neighboring Bhutan and Nepal to the ports of\nKolkata and Haldia. The north-south transport corridor in West Bengal extends from Haldia port\nvia Kolkata (also a river port) to the northern parts of West Bengal. In northern West Bengal, the\ncorridor  divides  into  routes  to  Nepal  and  Sikkim  to  the  west;  and  Assam,  Bhutan,  and  the\nnortheastern  states  of  India  to  the  east.  Along  the  corridor  are  several  eastward  links  to\nBangladesh.  A  large  portion  of  the  north-south  transport  corridor  and  the  eastward  links  to", "13\nBangladesh  are  in  urgent  need  of  improvement  from  the  current  deteriorated  two-lane,\nintermediate lane, and single-lane standards. NH 34, which forms the spine of the north-south\ntransport system, provides the nearest access to ports (Kolkata and Haldia) for the northeastern\nstates of India and neighboring Bhutan and Nepal, which are landlocked. Two state highways (SH\n1 and SH 10) provide links from the border with Bangladesh to the West Bengal corridor and the\nIndian national road network. An efficient transport system along the West Bengal corridor will not\nonly provide the basis for economic growth and poverty reduction in West Bengal, but will also\nhave significant implications for improving subregional economic cooperation by increasing trade\nand other economic activities. The ability of regions and countries to grow rapidly depends on\ntheir capacity to link with regional and global markets. Connectivity through improved transport\nhas important implications for poverty reduction by offering new economic opportunities through\nbetter market linkages and increased employment possibilities.\n46. In 1998, ADB provided TA (footnote 1) to help GWB prepare a strategy and investment\nplan for the development of the north-south corridor. The TA study, which was completed in June\n2000, identified a number of high priority multimodal transport infrastructure components for\nfinancing  and  implementation  through  a  mixture  of  Government  budget  and  public-private\npartnerships. The highest priority component in terms of economic development and poverty\nreduction impacts, strategic importance, and suitability for public funding is the improvement of\nNH 34, which is the artery of the north-south transport corridor. The improvement of the two state\nhighways that connect NH 34 to the Bangladesh border will enhance the subregional role of the\nnorth-south corridor in West Bengal. Two other priority components, the connections between\nHaldia and Kolkata, and the national highway network are being examined through detailed\nfeasibility studies funded by the NHAI and will be considered for ADB financing under the next\nphase of corridor development. Meanwhile, two other corridor sections, the Haldia-Uluberiya\nexpressway and the Raiganj-Islampur cut off, which have the potential for private participation,\nare being developed as public-private partnership projects.\nB. Objectives and Scope\n47. The objective of the Project is to support the development of a transport corridor in West\nBengal that will promote subregional economic activities, reduce poverty, and facilitate trade by\nremoving critical capacity constraints and improving transport efficiency. Because of the strategic\nlocation  of  the  north-south  corridor,  an  improved  transport  system  will  facilitate  subregional\neconomic cooperation, in addition to supporting rural development and increasing the earnings of\nlow-income groups by enhancing the mobility of rural communities.\n48. The Project will (i) enhance access along the north-south corridor; (ii) upgrade subregional\nconnections to the border with Bangladesh; and (iii) provide rural communities in the districts of\nthe  project  area  with  access  to  markets,  schools,  hospitals,  other  social  services,  and\nemployment  opportunities.  Through  policy  dialogue  carried  out  during  project  processing,  a\ncorridor  and  sector  development  framework  was  developed  to  promote  (i)  sound  corridor\ndevelopment and management policies, and (ii) improve the policy environment for the efficient\ndelivery of transport infrastructure in West Bengal. The Project will also strengthen environmental\nand social governance through mitigation measures in the design, construction, and operation of\nthe Project.", "14\n49. The investment component of the Project will comprise (i) improvement of about 370 km of\nNH 34 from Barasat to Raiganj; (ii) improvement of about 150 km of state highways: SH 10 from\nGajol to Hilli and SH 1 from Chakda to Bangaon; (iii) rehabilitation of about 100 km of rural access\nroads; (iv) consulting services for design and construction supervision; (v) project management;\nand (vi) land acquisition, resettlement activities, relocation of utilities, and tree replanting. The\nproject roads pass through the West Bengal districts of Maldah, Murshidabad, Nadia, North 24\nParganas and Uttar Dinajpur.\n50. NH 34 will be improved to a two-lane facility comprising 7 meters (m) carriageway and 2 x\n2.5 m paved shoulders plus 2 x 1.5 m earth soft verge. In the heavily trafficked sections and\ncongested towns of Baharampur, Ingraj Bazar, Kaliachak Bazar, Maldah and Raiganj, the road\nwill be four-lane with a 14 m pavement with median. The design of the pavement is in accordance\nwith the Indian Roads Congress and international design guidelines. The state highways will be\nimproved to a two-lane standard (7 m carriageway with 1.5 m paved shoulder on either side and 1\nm soft verge beyond that). A detailed description of the road improvements, including the road\nsafety,  social,  and  environmental  features  is  given  in  Appendix  4.  The  rural  access  roads\ncomponent will involve improving roads, small bridges, and other rural infrastructure in the project\narea to provide rural communities access to NH 34, SH 10, and SH 1; and therefore to markets,\nemployment opportunities, and social services. The low-cost rural transport infrastructure to be\nconstructed or improved will be selected in accordance with the following criteria: (i) uses the\ncommunity  participatory  approaches  for  project  identification;  (ii)  provides  the  poor  and\ndisadvantaged  groups  with  access  to  markets,  schools,  hospitals,  social  services  and\nemployment opportunities; (iii) connects rural communities to the project roads; (iv) does not have\nsignificant adverse environmental impact; (v) requires minimal land acquisition and no major\nstructural removal; and (vi) has arrangements for community maintenance. A tentative list of rural\ntransport infrastructure improvements has been finalized. The supervision consultants will assist\nwith the design, procurement, and implementation; and will conduct a baseline survey at the\ncommencement of the Project to develop monitorable poverty and development impact indicators.\nC. Cost Estimates\n51. The total cost of the Project is estimated at $323 million equivalent, of which the foreign\nexchange cost is estimated at $204 million representing 63 percent of the total cost. The local\ncurrency cost, including taxes and duties, is estimated at $119 million equivalent representing 37\npercent of the total cost. The project cost estimates are summarized in Table 1 and detailed in\nAppendix 5.", "15\nTable 1: Summary of Cost Estimates\n($ million)\nForeign Local Total\nItem Exchange Currency Cost\nA.

India has requested a loan of $210 million (representing 65 percent of the total project\ncost) from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources to finance the entire foreign exchange cost of the\nProject of $204 million and $6 million equivalent of the local currency cost. The remaining local\ncurrency cost of $113 million equivalent will be met by the central Government and GWB. The\nproposed local currency financing by ADB is minimal and amounts to only about 2 percent of the\ntotal project cost and 3 percent of the proposed ADB loan; it can be justified because (i) of the\nadministrative convenience of ADB financing the entire costs relating to consulting services, and\n(ii) the financing is for rural access roads.\n53. The loan will have a 25-year term, including a grace period of 5 years, an interest rate\ndetermined in accordance with ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility; a commitment charge of 0.75\npercent per annum; a front-end fee of 1.0 percent; conversions options that may be exercised in\naccordance  with  the  terms  of  the  draft  Loan  Agreement,  the  Loan  Regulations,  and  ADB\u2019s\nConversion Guidelines; and other terms and conditions set forth in the draft Loan Agreement. The\nGovernment has provided ADB with (i) the reasons for India\u2019s decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s\nLIBOR-based lending facility on the basis of these terms and conditions and (ii) an undertaking\nthat these choices were India\u2019s own independent decision and not made in reliance on any\ncommunication or advice from ADB. The portion of the loan relating to the state highways and\nrural access roads components, for $61.3 million, will be on-lent to GWB. The financing plan for\nthe Project is given in Table 2.", "16\nTable 2: Financing Plan\n($ million)\nForeign Local Total\nSource Exchange Currency Cost Percentage\nADB 204.0 6.0 210.0 65\nGovernment 0.0 113.0 113.0 35\n   Total 204.0 119.0 323.0 100\nADB = Asian Development Bank.\nSource = Mission\nE. The Executing Agencies\n54. MORTH will be the Executing Agency for the national highway component of the Project\nand WBPWRD for the state highway and rural access components. MORTH and WBPWRD have\nadequate experience gained from the implementation of ADB\u2019s first and second projects in the\nroad subsector (footnote 7).\nF.  Implementation Arrangements\n1.  Project Management\n55. The Project will be implemented by project implementation units (PIU) under MORTH for\nthe national highway component and WBPWRD for the state highway and rural access roads\ncomponents. The PIU will be staffed with experienced personnel both at the management level\nand at the project site. The PIU will be delegated sufficient administrative authority for effective\nand timely decision making on project implementation matters. Staff from MORTH, WBPWRD\nand the PIU have received training in contract management and social development, including\nresettlement, under two ongoing ADB advisory TAs for construction management and social\ndevelopment.10\n2. Implementation Schedule\n56. The Project will be implemented over 60 months, inclusive of design and preconstruction\nactivities, and is expected to be completed by June 2006. A summary project implementation\nschedule is given in Appendix 6. The implementation schedule allows for land acquisition and\nresettlement activities, and the clearance of all utilities and trees from the right-of-way (ROW).\nThese are to be undertaken prior to the award of the civil works contracts.\n                  \n10TA No. 3361-IND: Capacity Building for Contract Supervision and Management in NHAI, for $600,000, approved on 2\nDecember 1999; and TA 3365-IND: Capacity Building for Social Development, for $800,000, approved on 23\nDecember 1999.", "17\n3. Procurement\n57. Procurement of the civil works contract packages for the national and state highway\ncomponents will be undertaken in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement following\ninternational competitive bidding procedures. The contractors will be selected from prequalified\nbidders. Based on the experience of ADB\u2019s earlier road projects, the contract packages were\nmade sufficiently large to attract experienced contractors. The contracts for the rural access\ncomponent  will  be  let  under  local  competitive  bidding  procedures  using  the  Government\u2019s\nstandard bidding documents, which ADB reviewed and accepted. ADB has approved advance\naction for the civil works procurement on the understanding that such approval would not commit\nADB to finance the Project. Advance procurement action would allow MORTH and WBPWRD to\ncommence work on preconstruction activities and will shorten the implementation period by about\nnine months. A list of contract packages and the mode of procurement are given in Appendix 7.\n58. Since the disbursements under the Project will be mainly for civil works and consultants,\nthe direct payment and reimbursement procedures will be used in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan\nDisbursement Handbook dated January 2001. An imprest account will be provided in accordance\nwith ADB\u2019s guidelines to expedite disbursements. The initial amount to be deposited in the\nimprest account will not exceed the equivalent of $10,000,000.\n4. Consulting Services\n59. Internationally  recruited  consultants  will  assist  MORTH  and  WBPWRD  with  detailed\ndesign and construction supervision of the road improvement to be carried out under the Project.\nThe outline terms of reference and the person-month requirements for the detailed design and\nconstruction supervision services have been agreed to by MORTH and WBPWRD, and are given\nin Appendix 8. The consultants will be recruited by MORTH and WBPWRD in accordance with\nADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for the\nengagement of domestic consultants. ADB has approved advance action for the recruitment of\nthe design and construction supervision consultants on the understanding that such approval\ndoes not commit ADB to finance the Project.\n5. Project Supervision\n60. A project inception mission will be fielded soon after approval of the proposed loan to\ninitiate the project implementation process. MORTH, WBPWRD and ADB will review the overall\nprogress of the Project annually in addition to a comprehensive midterm review to be conducted\nafter  24  months  of  loan  effectivity.  Should  the  results  of  such  reviews  indicate  serious\nimplementation problems, MORTH, WBPWRD and ADB will agree on appropriate measures,\nincluding changes to implementation arrangements, to ensure that the project objectives are met.\n6. Progress Reports, Project Benefit Monitoring, Accounts and Audit\n61. To monitor project implementation, MORTH and WBPWRD will submit quarterly progress\nreports  to  ADB.  Within  six  months  of  the  physical  completion  of  the  Project,  MORTH  and\nWBPWRD will prepare and provide ADB with a project completion report covering details of\nproject  implementation  costs  and  benefit  monitoring  and  evaluation  activities.  MORTH  and\nWBPWRD will, with the assistance of the supervision consultants, undertake project performance\nmonitoring and evaluation in accordance with ADB\u2019s Project Performance Management System\nHandbook.  The  performance  indicators  that  will  be  monitored  include traffic levels, number of", "18\naccidents,  travel  time,  road  roughness,  freight  costs,  and  passenger  fares.  MORTH  and\nWBPWRD will maintain separate records of project expenditures and funding received for the\nProject  and  prepare  annual  project  accounts.  The  project  accounts  and  related  financial\nstatements will be audited by external auditors acceptable to ADB and submitted to ADB within\nnine months of the end of each fiscal year.\nG. Environmental and Social Measures\n1.  Environment\n62. The environmental category of the Project is B. An initial environmental examination was\nconducted during project preparation based on ADB\u2019s Environmental Guidelines for Selected\nInfrastructure Development Projects, and its summary is presented in Appendix 9. The findings\nindicate that the Project will not cause any significant adverse environmental impacts as the\nproposed highway improvements will not involve major realignment. No cultural or heritage areas,\nprotected  areas,  wetlands,  or  other  environmentally  sensitive  areas  will  be  disturbed.\nConstruction-related environmental impacts will be minimized by adopting good construction site\nmanagement and engineering practices. The State Forest Department and the Office of the\nDistrict Collector will be involved in the plans for tree felling and compensatory afforestation. An\nenvironmental  management  action  plan  has  been  prepared,  consistent  with  the  initial\nenvironmental examination, and will be implemented by MORTH and WBPWRD with assistance\nfrom  the  supervision  consultants.  MORTH  and  WBPWRD  will  monitor  and  report  on  the\nimplementation of the action plan through the monthly progress reports. Adequate funds are\nincluded in the project budget for this purpose.\n2. Social\n63. A detailed social analysis was carried out during project preparation in accordance with\nADB\u2019s guidelines. During the social impact assessment, the census-survey teams conducted over\n30 meetings with primary and secondary stakeholders on the road alignments. The meetings\nwere typically attended by the affected people, local community leaders, village panchayat heads,\nstate, and local WBPWRD officials. Women and other vulnerable groups were also consulted on\nthe project impact. The communities were all supportive of the Project owing to the significant\neconomic benefits to be generated by improving the national and state highways and rural access\nroads: improved transportation and new opportunities for business for local communities. The\nsocial impact analysis also indicates that the adverse impacts of the Project would be minimal. As\nthe Government already largely owns the ROW required to improve NH 34, SH 1, and SH 10,\nland acquisition will be minimal. The Resettlement Plan (RP) for the Project was prepared by the\nGovernment,  and  will  be  implemented  in  consultation  with  state  authorities  and  the  people\naffected in accordance with ADB\u2019s policy on involuntary resettlement.11 The total expenditure for\nthe RP is estimated at Rs618 million.\n64. The principal adverse social impacts will be dislocation of the roadside small business\nenterprises. A census conducted in February\u2013March (2001) generated a full inventory of assets\nand nature of losses by those to be relocated. About 9,200 small business enterprises,1,300\nhouseholds, and 452 community properties will be affected. These are largely squatters/informal\nsettlers and encroachers on the ROW, particularly around bus stops, road intersections, rural\nmarkets, and town centers. The rural sections of the ROW are clear, which constitute about 75\npercent of the total length of the project roads. The affected small business enterprises will be\n                  \n11ADB. 1998. The Bank\u2019s Policy on Involuntary Resettlement. In Handbook on Resettlement. Appendix 1. Manila.", "19\nallowed to relocate on the edge of the available ROW land through a ROW management plan\naimed at protecting the improved roads from future congestion and encroachment. This will be\ncarried  out  through  formal  leasing  or  contract  agreement  with  WBPWRD.  This  strategy  will\nenhance the movement of through traffic and improve road safety as well as ensure control over\nROW  for  future  obstruction-free  improvement  to  four  lanes.  This  strategy  constitutes  \u201cbest\npractice\u201d in road development. WBPWRD is currently conducting site-specific pilot studies for\nROW management and development (including drainage, solid waste management, etc.) for local\nbusinesses and markets with clearly demarcated safety zones for through traffic. This will reduce\nthe overall impact on affected people, particularly the most vulnerable, and assist in restoring\nbusinesses and livelihoods.\n65. The  summary  RP,  which  is  based  on  ADB\u2019s  policy  and  guidelines  for  involuntary\nresettlement is given in Appendix 10. The absence of formal land titles by affected people will not\nbe  a  bar  to  assistance  and  rehabilitation.  The  resettlement  principles  adopted  will  provide\ncompensation for lost assets at replacement cost, irrespective of ownership status, and for loss of\nincome  and  livelihood.  This  includes  income  substitution  and  transfer  costs  during\nreestablishment plus income restoration measures in the case of lost livelihood. GWB will publish\nthe  RP,  using  project  brochures  in  the  local  language  to  explain  the  impact,  resettlement\nassistance, and relocation policy for those affected, and tentative implementation schedule. This\ninformation sharing and consultation process will continue during project preparation, planning,\nand implementation.\n66. The social analysis of the Project indicates that a number of interrelated social and health\nissues such as road safety, trafficking of women and children, and the spread of HIV/AIDS12 need\nto be addressed. The improvement of the project roads have been designed with the objective of\nsafer roads with reduced disruption of livelihoods, and better management of the ROW for future\nroad expansion and development. The RP also has provisions for improving awareness about\nroad safety, trafficking of women and children, sex trade, and spread of sexually transmitted\ndiseases (STD) in the project area through local nongovernment organizations and community\ninvolvement. In addition, the project design includes (i) offset/symmetrical widening to avoid built-\nup areas; (ii) paved shoulders for slow-moving and nonmotorized traffic; (iii) addition of bus/truck\nparking or road turnouts for improved road safety; (iv) provision for road signs at pedestrian\ncrossings and bus stations; and (v) public amenities such as rest rooms and telephone booths.\nThe project civil works contracts will include the requirement for an information and education\ncampaign on STDs and HIV/AIDS for construction workers as part of the health and safety\nprogram at the campsites during the construction period. The contractor will, through a suitably\nexperienced  nongovernment  organization,  extend  the  campaign  to  surrounding  communities\nliving in the project influence area. The construction supervision consultant will monitor and\ncontrol  the  contractor\u2019s  performance  of  these  activities,  including  the  use  of  child  labor.  An\nongoing ADB  regional TA 13 aims to increase awareness in Bangladesh, India, and Nepal of the\ntrafficking  of  women  and  children,  and  to  help  them  formulate  and  implement  country  and\nsubregional action plans to prevent and reduce in-country and subregional trafficking.\n67. AIDS has been recognized as a serious public health issue in India since the late 1980s.\nThe Government of India prepared its first Medium-Term Plan for Prevention and Control of AIDS\nwith  World  Health  Organization  support  in  1989.  A  more  comprehensive  Strategic  Plan  for\nPrevention and Control of AIDS in India was prepared with funding from the World Bank\u2019s First\n                  \n12HIV/AIDS refers to Human Immunodeficiency Virus/Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome.\n13TA 5948-REG: Combating Trafficking of Women and Children in South Asia, for $440,000, approved on 14\nNovember 2000.", "20\nNational HIV/AIDS Control Project (1992). India\u2019s HIV/AIDS program, which is managed by the\nNational AIDS Control Organization, aims to (i) strengthen management capacity at the center\nand in states, (ii) promote public awareness, (iii) improve blood safety, (iv) build surveillance\ncapacity, and (v) improve control of sexually transmitted diseases. The national organization is\nfocusing  on  developing  complementary  activities  to  produce  effective  community-based\ninterventions to promote behavioral change.\n68. GWB  recognizes  the  need  for  effective  community-based  interventions,  and  that  sex\nworkers and their clients are priority groups for focused STD services, and condom promotion,\nand behavioral change. GWB has established the West Bengal State AIDS Preventive and\nControl Society. The specific objectives of the strategic action plan for West Bengal include (i)\ntargeted intervention, STD control and condom programming; (ii) prevention of infection in low risk\npopulations; (iii) surveillance, training, research and development, and institutional strengthening;\n(iv) capacity building for care and support; and (v) collaboration with the public and private\nsectors.    West  Bengal  also  received  assistance  under  the  World  Bank\u2019s  Second  National\nHIV/AIDS Control Project.\n69. The  West  Bengal  Sexual  Health  Project,  funded  by  the  Department  for  International\nDevelopment  (DFID)  of  the  United  Kingdom  will  contribute  to  the  development  of  a\ncomprehensive  state-wide  sexual  health  program  by  collaborating  with  a  wide  range  of\ngovernment  and  nongovernment  groups,  and  by  building  a  consultative  process  into  its\nmanagement  structures.  The  Sexual  Health  Project  aims  to  reduce  the  spread  of  the  HIV\nepidemic and its social and economic impact in West Bengal, by improving sexual health in the\nproject-supported communities. Among the achievements to date are (i) since May 1996, over 45\ncapacity-building events/training workshops have been organized; (ii) over 550,000 people are\npotentially  being  covered;  (iii)  a  cadre  of  about  200  trained  outreach  workers,  community\ninfluencers and peer educators are implementing sexual health programs; and (iv) 45 clinics are\noperational and covering 52 intervention sites in Kolkata and seven districts. Another HIV/STD\nprevention  project  funded  by  DFID  is  the  Healthy  Highways  Truckers  Project.  The  project\nobjective is to improve access to health services by creating, throughout India, a coordinated\nnetwork of about 300 sexual health truck stops located at the key stops already used by truckers\nfor rest, recreation, or the transhipment of goods. These centers will be managed by a variety of\nservice providers to improve the sexual health of truckers and their sexual partners. These\nservices will have three key elements: peer counseling, promotion of condoms, and standardized\nSTD treatment.\nV. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION\nA. Economic Analysis\n70. The economic evaluation of the Project, comprising improvements to NH 34, SH 1 and SH\n10, is based on the comparison of the with- and without-project situations. Without the Project, the\nexisting intermediate to two-lane road will become even more heavily congested and vehicle\nspeeds will fall to lower levels. Accelerated pavement deterioration through increased use will\nraise road maintenance costs. With the Project, the road will be improved with wide paved\nshoulders for slow-moving and nonmotorized traffic, which will increase capacity, resulting in\nvehicle operating cost savings, maintenance cost savings, and shortened travel time. The option\nto widen the project road to four lanes was also investigated during project preparation, but the\ntwo-lane option was found to be the current least-cost solution.", "21\n71. Economic evaluations were carried out for the three project analysis sections of NH 34,\nSH 1 and SH 10, as well as for the Project as a whole. To estimate the economic internal rate of\nreturn (EIRR), benefit streams were calculated for 20 years, which is the estimated economic life\nof the improvements under the Project. Benefits and costs were estimated net of duties and\ntaxes, and are expressed in constant May 2001 prices. Improvement costs include provision for\ncivil works by contract, acquisition of ROW, and construction supervision. The base EIRR for the\nProject is estimated at 21 percent, while the EIRRs for sections analyzed vary between 15 and 25\npercent. Details of the traffic analysis and EIRR calculation are given in Appendix 11.\n72. The sensitivity of the EIRR to changes in the underlying benefit and cost parameters was\nanalyzed. This was undertaken for each section of the project roads and for the Project as a\nwhole. The results of this analysis are shown in Table A11.11 of Appendix 11. The scenario of an\nincrease in capital costs of 20 percent and a fall in the level of benefits by 20 percent reduces the\nEIRR  for  the  overall  Project  from  21.3  to  14.9  percent.  The  switching  value14  for  cost  was\ndetermined to be 87 percent, and the switching value for benefits 47 percent.\n73. The estimated direct benefits of NH 34, SH 10, and SH 1 to the economy are Rs4,804\nmillion, Rs643 million, and Rs140 million respectively in present value terms. The direct benefits\nfor the Project as a whole are Rs5,587 million in present value terms. These figures represent the\nsum of the present value of benefits to passengers, freight users, vehicle owners, and the\nGovernment. These are conservative estimates, because only direct benefits of the Project have\nbeen considered. The distribution analysis (Table 3) is based on the existing situation in the road\ntransport industry and an estimate of how this will develop in the future. The freight transport\nindustry is fully competitive in determining freight rates, but the passenger transport industry is\nregulated and fares are set by the state. The passenger transport industry may be gradually\nderegulated in the future. Freight owners and operators presently pass on part of the savings they\nreceive through lower vehicle operating costs to freight users. Bus owners and operators will pass\non more of the savings they receive from reduced vehicle operating costs once the industry is\nfully deregulated.\nTable 3: Distribution of Net Benefits\n(Rs million)\nFinancial\nPresent Economic Economic Passenger Freight Vehicle Government\nNational Present Financial Users Users Owners Economy\nItem Value Value Net\nBenefits\nRoad User Benefits 11,978 11,978 136 2,638 8,413 791\nCosts\nCapital Cost (7,803) (6,968) 835 835\nO&M Cost    646    577 (69) (69)\nNet Present Value (7,157) 5,587 12,744 136 2,638 8,413 1,557\nGains and 136 2,638 8,413 (5,600) 5,587\nLosses\nNote: The net loss to the government/economy (minus 5,600) is calculated as minus 7,157 + 1,557.\nO&M = operation and maintenance.\nSource = Feasibility study and Mission.\n                  \n14The switching value shows the percentage increase in a cost variable (or decline in a benefit variable) required for the\nnet present value (NPV) to become zero, which is the same as the EIRR reducing to the cutoff level of 12 percent.", "22\n74. The benefits to both passenger and freight users will be distributed between the people in\nthe direct influence of the project area and those outside the project area. In terms of the\ndistribution of benefits in the project area, a recent study found that approximately 80 percent of\nall vehicles originated or were destined for districts in the project area, the remaining traffic\noriginated or was destined for other parts of India or neighboring countries. Thus about 80 percent\nof the benefits are assumed to accrue to the people in the project area. In terms of passenger\nbenefits, which represent benefits to bus users, a large part of this benefit will be passed to the\npoor  in  the  project  area  as  they  use  public  transport.  The  benefits  to  freight  users  will  be\ndistributed between enterpreneurs who tend to purchase freight services after they have bought,\nin bulk, the produce of several different farmers, and also between some of the rural poor who\nship their own agricultural produce directly.  The largest part of net benefits go to the vehicle\nowners themselves, who are car, bus, and truck owners and operators.\n75. Besides vehicle operating cost savings, the Project is expected to contribute several\nnonquantifiable  benefits  including  the  provision  of  more  reliable  transport  services.  This  will\nenable the more efficient distribution of goods and services, including industrial and agricultural\ninputs and outputs; provide easier access to social services and markets; and increase the\nmobility of people and their employment opportunities.\nB. Poverty Impact\n76. Transport has direct impacts on the personal welfare of all income groups. Access to at\nleast minimal infrastructure services is one of the essential components of personal welfare.\nImprovements in transport not only provide people with more convenient access to a broad range\nof socioeconomic opportunities, but also have strong income effects by lowering transport cost\nand hence the prices of consumer goods and services. For the poor, the lack of affordable access\ndeprives them of the ability to take advantage of job opportunities and even of very basic social\nservices. Reliable access to schools and health services for the poor contributes directly to their\naccumulation  of  human  capital,  which  is  a  key  factor  in  sustainable  poverty  reduction.\nImprovement of the transport system in the West Bengal corridor will bring significant benefits to\nthe economy of West Bengal, as well as social and economic benefits to the 19 million people\nliving in the project influence area. Improved access will help reduce poverty by (i) increasing\nlabor mobility, particularly to distant markets; (ii) increasing employment opportunities offered by\naccelerated industrialization; (iii) reducing loss of perishables, thereby allowing for increased\nfarmgate prices; (iv) improving access to rural areas by health, school, veterinary, and rural\ndevelopment workers; (v) providing greater opportunities for tribal members, mostly itinerant\ncasual workers, to access income and employment opportunities; and (vi) generating transport-\nassociated small businesses such as service stations, wayside foodstalls, and guesthouses. A\nsummary of the poverty and development impacts of the Project is given in Appendix 12.\n77. The project area covers five districts, namely, North 24-Parganas, Maldah, Murshidabad,\nNadia,  and Uttar Dinajpur. The population of these districts is approximately 19.5 million, which is\nabout 29 percent of the total population of West Bengal. Of the population in these districts,\napproximately 76 percent live in rural areas. Per capita income varies between the districts,\nranging from Rs1,776 in Uttar Dinajpur to Rs2,351 in North 24-Parganas. The poor are classified\nas those whose annual (five-member) family income lies below Rs15,000 per annum and is\nreferred to as the population living below the poverty line as defined by GWB. Recent estimates\nby the National Sample Survey Organization for 2000 show that approximately 27 percent of\npeople in West Bengal are living below the poverty line, which is 1 percent higher  than  the figure", "23\nfor India as a whole at 26 percent. From recent data in West Bengal, the estimate of poor people\nin the districts through which the project road passes is shown in the Table 4:\nTable 4: Percentage of Poor by Project District\nDistrict % Poor\nNorth 24 Parganas 32\nNadia 31\nMurshidabad 31\nMaldah 33\nUttar Dinajpur 32\nSource: Feasibility study.\n78. Rural  development  funding  throughout  West  Bengal  amounted  to  Rs4,089  million  in\nFY2000/01. Expenditure in previous years was Rs3,663 million in FY 1999/2000, and Rs2,780\nmillion in FY1998/99. The Public Works Department is undertaking rural roads construction under\nthe Rural Development Department. A 20-year road program has been introduced to link all\nvillages with a population of 1,500 and above, and 50 percent of the villages with a population\nbetween 1,000 to 1,500.15 Rural road schemes presently under construction are estimated to have\na total project cost of Rs4,974 million ($108 million). These roads total an approximate length of\n2,317 km, and include 221 individual roads. Other rural infrastructure is also being undertaken in\nthe project area and includes irrigation work, improvements to canals and school buildings,\nsericulture projects, and other small-scale improvements to rural infrastructure.\n79. In the rural areas of six less developed districts of North Bengal, namely, Malda, Uttar\nDinajpur (the project road passes through these two districts), Coochbehar, Dakshin Dinajpur,\nDarjeeling, and Jalpaiguri, special provisions have been made for implementing schemes relating\nto the construction and improvement of roads, bridges, culverts, embankments, drainage facilities,\nsanitation,  and  other  infrastructure  facilities.  The  total  2000/01  plan  expenditure  for  road\nrestoration and development in these districts is Rs170 million. The schemes under this program\nare implemented by the Zilla and Mahakuma parishads. The following are taken into account\nwhen devising each project: (i) the entire outlay is spent on the rural people of North Bengal\ndistricts; (ii) employment generation is the main objective of the program, thus labor intensive\nschemes are preferred; and (iii) environmental needs will be safeguarded during implementation.\n80. Besides road programs in West Bengal, several other infrastructure development projects\nreceiving international funding are having a direct impact on poverty reduction. The Netherlands\nGovernment has instituted projects in irrigation, soil conservation, and soil improvement in the\nnorth of West Bengal. The World Bank is conducting work in the agriculture sector, power sector,\nand development schemes for the health sector. The United States Agency for International\nDevelopment has supported programs to promote health services, and food aid grants for the\npoor. The United Kingdom is helping to reduce poverty; tackle environmental problems; and\npromote the economic, social, political and legal status of women in all sectors. Japan attaches a\nhigh significance to poverty reduction programs focusing on medical care and health, agriculture,\nand rural development.\n                  \n15 In the Ninth Five-Year Plan, the fixed target is to construct 300 km of road connecting 800 villages.", "24\nC. Risks\n81. Measures  such  as  advance  procurement  action,  use  of  ADB\u2019s  standard  tender\ndocumentation, and strengthened project management arrangements are minimizing potential\ndelays in project implementation. The prequalification criteria and packaging of the civil works\ncontracts will ensure that experienced contractors are selected. Civil works contracts will only be\nawarded after RP implementation, and when the rights to the land and clearance of utilities and\ntrees are obtained. The Government\u2019s commitment for counterpart funding through budgetary\nallocations will also be required prior to approval of contract award by ADB. The Government has\nassured that adequate annual budget allocations will be made to maintain the project facilities\nafter completion. The basic assumptions on benefits and costs for the EIRR calculations were\nsubjected to sensitivity tests under various adverse scenarios.

A detailed description of the road improvement is as follows.\n2. National Highway No 34. Work includes the following:\n(i)   Approximately 370 kilometers (km) of existing two-lane highway along National\nHighway 34 (NH 34) will be rehabilitated and upgraded. Work will start at km 31,\nnear Barasat to the north of Kolkata on NH 34, and end at km 398, near Raiganj.\nThe terrain is generally flat with a gradual rise in ground elevation from south to\nnorth.  Road elevation above the surrounding terrain varies from ground level up\nto 3 meters (m) above ground level. At major bridge crossings the height of the\nhighway embankment reaches between 8\u201313 m above ground level. The highway\npasses  through  six  urban  centers  and  numerous  towns,  settlements,  market\nareas, and roadside commercial areas along its length.\n(ii)   The highway cross-section adopted is for two 3.5 m lanes with 2.5 m wide paved\nshoulders, giving a total width of 12 m. In the towns of Baharampur, Ingraj Bazar,\nKaliachak Bazar, Maldah, and Raiganj the highway cross-section will be for four\n3.5 m lanes with 1-1.5 m paved shoulders, giving a total paved width of 16-17 m.\nFor four-lane sections, a central median of 4 m has been adopted, but this will be\nreduced to a minimum of 1.2 m where space is restricted.\n(iii)   The design speed adopted is 100 km/hr in rural areas and 80 km/hr in urban\nareas.\n(iv)   Reconstruction  work  for  the  existing  pavements  will  consist  of  removing  and\nreconstructing existing shoulders; reconstructing/widening existing embankment\nto suit the new cross-section; leveling course to existing pavement; providing new\ndense  bituminous  macadam  (DBM)  overlay;  and  new  Asphaltic  Concrete\nsurfacing.  The DBM layer will vary in thickness depending on the condition of the\nexisting pavement.\n(v)   Widening and paving the shoulders has been adopted to allow for:\n(a)  Segregating slow- and fast-moving traffic. This will assist in keeping the\nmain lanes clear for fast-moving traffic and improve safety by reducing\npotential conflicts between different traffic categories.\n(b)  Emergency parking. This will assist in keeping the main lanes free from\nobstructions that reduce capacity and pose a safety hazard.\n(c)  Structural support to main lanes.\n(vi)   Unpaved or grass verges will be 1.5 m wide for two-lane roads and 1-1.5 m wide\nfor four-lane roads. They will function as a structural transition and accommodate\ntraffic  signs,  safety  guardrails,  route  signs,  lighting  columns,  and  other  road\nfurniture. Verges will be omitted in urban areas where kerbed footways will be\nprovided.", "33\nAppendix 4, page 2\n(vii)   Road drainage structures will be cleared, repaired, upgraded or reconstructed as\nnecessary. All bridges will be rehabilitated and widened as necessary. Six new\nroad-overpasses will be constructed at major railway crossings and one new\nroad-underpass. Two new river bridges will be constructed over the Mahananda\nand Bhagirathi rivers.\n(viii)   Vehicle  overloading  will  be  addressed  by  procurement  of  (a)  a  suitable\nweighbridge for installation at a location to be determined under the Project, in\nconsultation with Ministry of Road Transport and Highways and Government of\nWest Bengal; and (b) four sets of transportable axle weighers for use during axle-\nload control operations along the project road. Training will be provided on the\nuse of the weighers and axle-load control operations.\n(ix)   Toll plazas and associated facilities.\n3. State Highways No 1 and 10. Work includes the following:\n(i)   This component consists of rehabilitating and upgrading two state highways. The\nproject includes approximately 109.9 km of existing intermediate lane highway of\nSH 10. Work will start near Gazol, at the junction with NH 34, and end at Hilli on\nthe border with Bangladesh. On SH 1, the Project includes approximately 40 km\nof existing intermediate lane highway. Work will start at Chakda, at the junction\nwith NH 34, and end at Bangaon on the border with Bangladesh.\n(ii)   The highway cross-section adopted is for two 3.5 m lanes with 1.5 m wide paved\nshoulders, giving a total width of 10 m. In urban areas, the highway cross-section\nwill be for four 3 m lanes with 1 m paved shoulders, giving a total paved width of\n14 m. For four-lane sections a central median of 4 m has been adopted but this\nwill be reduced to a minimum of 1.2 m where space is restricted.\n(iii)   The design speed adopted is 80 km/hr in rural areas and 65 km/hr in urban areas.\n(iv)   Reconstruction  work  for  the  existing  pavements  will  consist  of  removing  and\nreconstructing existing shoulders; reconstructing/widening existing embankment\nto suit the new cross-section; leveling course to existing pavement; providing new\nDBM overlay; and new asphaltic concrete surfacing. The DBM layer will vary in\nthickness depending on the condition of the existing pavement.\n(v)   Widening and paving the shoulders has been adopted to allow for\n(a)  Segregating slow- and fast-moving traffic. This will assist in keeping the\nmain lanes clear for fast-moving traffic and improve safety by reducing\npotential conflicts between different traffic categories.\n(b)  Emergency parking. This will assist in keeping the main lanes free from\nobstructions that reduce capacity and pose a safety hazard.\n(c)  Structural support to main lanes.", "34\nAppendix 4, page 3\n(vi)   The  Project  will  include  rehabilitating  and  widening,  where  necessary,  of  all\nexisting bridges and the construction of 13 new bridges.  All existing culverts will\nbe rehabilitated and 103 new culverts will be constructed.\n(vii)   Unpaved or grass verges will be 1.5 m wide for two-lane roads and 1 m wide for\nfour-lane  roads.    These  verges  will  function  as  a  structural  transition  and\naccommodate traffic signs, safety guardrails, route signs, lighting columns, and\nother  road  furniture.    Verges  will  be  omitted  in  urban  areas  where  kerbed\nfootways will be provided.\n4. Social and Environmental Measures. Work will include the following:\n(i)   Bus  stops  will  be  constructed  at  suitable  locations.  The  bus  stop  layout  will\ninclude  covered  shelters,  toilets,  water  facilities,  and  provision  for\nshops/refreshment outlets where appropriate.  The designs will ensure that buses\nwill be directed to stopping bays off the main highway so that passengers can\nsafely exit and enter buses.\n(ii)   Roadside parking will be constructed near markets, dhabas, truck loading areas,\nand truck repair centers.  These parking areas will provide appropriate access\nroutes on and off the main highway and be sized to accommodate the needs of\neach particular location.\n(iii)   In flood-prone areas, the highway embankment will be raised.  The extent of this\nwork will be defined under the Project after hydrographic and hydraulic studies\nhave been completed.\n(iv)   The design of all road junctions will be improved to include road markings, traffic\nsigns, traffic signal control at major urban junctions, street lighting, pedestrian\nfootways, fencing, and crossings.\n5. Road Safety Measures. Work will include the following:\n(i)   Facilities for pedestrians include hard shoulders and footways; kerbed footways in\nurban  areas;  pedestrian  crossings  at  each  urban,  semiurban,  village,  and\nsettlement area; pedestrian crossings and fencing at bus stops; footways and\nparking areas at market areas; footways and pedestrian fencing at major road\njunctions; and street lighting at major urban areas.\n(ii)   Design features for vehicles and vehicle users include road marking throughout\nthe Project; traffic signs, including mandatory speed restrictions; safety guardrails\non high embankments; hard shoulders to segregate traffic and accommodate\nbroken-down vehicles; speed humps at approaches to urban areas; street lighting\nat major urban junctions; roadside parking areas at bus stops, market areas,\ndhabas, repair centers, etc.; junction layouts will be improved; and traffic signal\ncontrols or roundabouts will be constructed at major urban intersections.", "35\nAppendix 5\nPROJECT COST ESTIMATES\n($ million)\nForeign Local Total\nItem Exchange Currency Cost\nA.

Screening of Potential Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures\n1. The  environmental  impacts  due  to  improvement  of  highways  along  the  existing\nalignments induce relatively insignificant adverse impacts as compared with construction of\nhighways  along  new  alignments.  Moreover,  most  impacts  arising  due  to  highway\nimprovements  can  be  mitigated  through  engineering  designs,  and  good  construction\npractices, accompanied by appropriate environmental mitigation measures and management\nplans.  The  potential  impacts  due  to  improvement  of  the  Project  roads  are  described\nhereunder along with the mitigation measures.\n1.  Geology/Stone Quarries\n2. Potential  Impacts.  The  entire  national  highways  (NH)  and  state  highways  (SH)\nsections are in the deltaic plains with very little potential for stone quarrying operations. The\nstone-bearing areas are located at distances ranging between 15 to 120 kilometers (km) or\neven  beyond  the  adjoining  Birbhum  and  Santhal  Parganas  districts,  implying  that  both\nexisting roads as well as dedicated new haul roads will be required for aggregate hauling\noperations. Quarrying and hauling of such large quantities of aggregates will lead to an\nincrease in dust and noise levels, increased vehicular emissions along the haul roads, and\npossible negligence to safety and health of the workforce.\n3. Impact Mitigation. Mitigation measures have been defined to minimize the impacts\nduring quarry operations and upgrading of existing roads or constructing new dedicated haul\nroads and hauling operations. These cover dust suppression measures along haul roads,\nemission control procedures for haul trucks/dumpers, compliance with local environmental\nregulations, and occupational and safety controls.\n2.  Soil/Borrow Areas\n4. Potential Impacts. The improvement works will involve widening the carriageway\nand shoulders along the existing alignment and raising the existing embankment of the\nhighway sections at certain stretches that are routinely flooded/waterlogged and therefore\nrequire large quantities of earth. The project region presents three options for meeting the\nearthwork requirements. The first option is excavation of the drainage channel/river beds1 of\nthe  region.  Due  to  the  deltaic  conditions  and  inherent  in  adequate  natural  drainage\nconstrictions, significant siltation has occurred in the channels and rivers of the region. Being\nin the deltaic region, the silt could well serve as embankment/road construction material.\n5. The second option is use of fly ash from the Farakka Super Thermal Power Plant (km\n297-298). Consultations with the fly ash division authorities of the Farakka Thermal Power\nPlant has revealed that the thermal power plant has huge reserves and ash could be sourced\nfrom their Nishindra and Malancha ash pond areas. The Ministry of Environment and Forest\nhas issued a notification for regulating the use of fly ash in and around any thermal plant. As\nper the notification, fly ash/bottom ash/pond ash must be used in construction activity at least\nup to 25% within a 50-km radius of any coal-based thermal power plant. The use of fly ash\nfor road construction has been well recognized and already implemented2 in India. The\n                                                          \n1 The option has been well received by the Directorate of Irrigation and Waterways, Government of West Bengal\nduring the consultations as a part of the initial environmental assessment.\n2 Fly ash has been successfully used in the construction of approach road embankments in a flood-prone/water\nlogged-areas for Nizamuddin Bridge across River Yamuna; reinforced fly ash (using polymer materials) was", "44\nAppendix 9, page 2\nIndian  Roads  Congress  is  publishing  guidelines  for  use  of  fly  ash  in  embankment\nconstruction for highways in India.\n6. The third option is to use agricultural lands either alongside or from interior lands\nwithin an economical distance from the highway. At present the local farmers lease their\nagricultural fields for excavation of earth generally up to 1.25 meters below the ground level\nmainly  for  short-term  economic  gains.  Given  the  landholding  pattern  and  land  forms\nregulations in West Bengal, availability of large chunks of lands is very unlikely. Even if\nnegotiated with willing owners, land may be available in innumerable places. Excavation of\nsuch a huge extent of agricultural lands at numerous places will make the hauling operations\ndifficult, nonfeasible, and environmentally unsustainable. Therefore, the first two options are\nto be preferably explored for NH 34 improvement, while the second and third option for state\nhgihway improvement.\n7. Impact Mitigation. Mitigation measures have been defined to minimize the impacts\nduring borrowing in river/channel beds and other material sourcing options.\n3.  Hydrogeology/Ground Water\n8. Potential  Impacts.  Although,  the  region  does  have  surface  water  bodies,\ngroundwater  is  the  most  often  and  easily  accessed  source.  An  assessment  of  the\nconstruction water demand and the available/recommended groundwater yield/potential3 of\nthe project region indicates that use of groundwater for the highway improvement works will\nnot have any significant impacts on the groundwater resources of the region.\n9. Impact  Mitigation.  Precautionary  measures  for  selection/construction  of  new\ntube/bore wells are defined in the Environmental Mitigation Action Plan. The tube/bore wells\nare to be left in good working condition after the completion of the works for the use of the\nlocal community. The groundwater, if used for human consumption in the workforce camps,\nwill be supplied from deep tube wells (100 meters and beyond) to prevent arsenic4 ingestion\nby the workforce. If unavoidable, the water used for human consumption will be treated for\narsenic using activated alumina as adsorbent or any other suitable method.\n4. Water Quality\n10. Potential  Impacts.  During  the  construction/rehabilitation  of  the  bridges/cross\ndrainage structures, discharge of construction effluent directly into the watercourses may\nimpact its quality. Liquid and solid waste discharges from petroleum, oil, and lubricants\nworkforce camps, and all other operational areas may impact upon the water quality of the\nreceiving water body if disposed of directly.\n11. Impact Mitigation. The impacts on water quality during the rehabilitation of the\ncrossdrainage  structures  can  be  minimized  by  scheduling  the  construction  works  for\nnonmonsoon months to the extent possible. For structures across the major water bodies,\nappropriate mitigation measures to prevent and/or minimize the impacts on water quality\nhave been defined. In any case, these impacts will be limited to the construction stage and\n                                                                \nused for embankment construction of Sarita Vihar flyover, Delhi under the design and construction supervision\nof Central Road Research Institute, Mathura Road, New Delhi\n3 Recommended yield and groundwater potential of the project region has been assessed from the region-\nspecific study reports prepared by the Central Ground Water Board, Government of India\n4 Consultation  of  the  study  reports  prepared  by  the  Central  Ground  Water  Board  indicate  that  arsenic\ncontamination of groundwater occurs up to 80 meters below ground level.", "45\nAppendix 9, page 3\nare transitory in nature. Measures for workforce camps and operational areas like petroleum,\noil, and lubricants storage areas/hot mix plant areas have also been defined.\n5.  Terrestrial Flora & Fauna\n12. Potential Impacts. The vegetative cover/trees within the COI will have to be cleared\nto make way for improvement works. The tree enumeration survey has indicated that NH 34\nhas some 185 trees per km, whereas SH 10 and SH 1 have 110 and 97 trees per km\nrespectively  within  the  COI.  The  actual  number  of  trees  to  be  felled  due  to  highway\nimprovement works will be far less and has to be determined after finalizing the engineering\ndesigns and alignment marking on-site. Most of these trees do not have significant ecological\nand/or commercial value but provide a serene landscape to the road users. The trees also\nserve as a nesting place for the tree-dwelling avian fauna. Therefore clearing of trees will\nhave a visible impact on road users and also temporarily upon the tree-dwelling fauna.\n13. Impact Mitigation. The impacts due to tree-clearing operations can be gradually\nretrieved by replanting. New saplings are to be planted (at the rate of five saplings for every\ntree  felled)  as  per  the  stipulation  of  the  Directorate  of  Forests,  Government  of  West\nBengal.(GWB) The replantation program is to be scheduled to commence prior to completion\nof construction works so that green cover is retrieved as early as possible.\n6.  Air Quality\n14. Potential Impacts. The highway improvements are expected to provide higher speed\nfor through traffic, and  reduce congestion in urban stretches/level crossings and service\nareas  at  required  intervals  for  highway  users.  Therefore  the  current  pattern  of  slowing\ndown/stopping vehicles near urban/congested stretches will be significantly reduced and the\nmovement of through traffic will be relatively unhindered. This will have beneficial impact in\nterms of improved air quality along roadsides as compared with the present situation. The\nforecasted  air  quality  concentrations  using  CALINE-4  model5  and  air  quality  model  of\nTransport Road Research Laboratory of United Kingdom show that in all the scenarios the\nair quality levels are within the National Ambient Air Quality Standards except for suspended\nparticulate matter. The models considered traffic forecasts up to 2025 for NH 34, SH 10 and\nSH 1 and the vehicle emission factors recommended by the Indian Institute of Petroleum.\n15. Impact Mitigation. Impacts on air quality and noise during the construction stage are\ntransitory and can be largely mitigated by exercising control measures. The measures are\ndetailed in the Environmental Mitigation Action Plan (EMAP).\n7.  Construction Debris\n16. Potential  Impacts.  The  debris  from  dismantling  existing  pavement,  bridges  and\ndrainage structures, excavation and embankment construction, demolition of buildings, and\nsite clearing operations need to be safely handled to minimize impacts.\n17. Impact Mitigation. The construction debris is to be recycled into new works subject\nto meeting the specifications and prior approval of the Implementing Agency. However,\nrecyclying the entire volume of the dismantled material may not be possible. Therefore,\nsurplus debris needs to be safely disposed. Broad parameters for safe disposal of debris are\ndefined in the EMAP.\n                                                          \n5 CALINE4 was developed by the California Institute for Transportation, United States.", "46\nAppendix 9, page 4\n8.  Archaeological and Historical Monuments\n18. Potential Impacts. There are no protected or declared archaeological or historically\nimportant monuments along the project sections of NH 34 and SH.\n9.  Shrines, Idols, and Statues\n19. Potential Impacts: Statues of political and spiritual leaders, roadside shrines, and\nsmall  temples  and  other  religious  structures  within  the  right-of-way  are  to  be  suitably\nrelocated to adjoining places along the improved highway sections.\n20. Impact Mitigation. The relocation of such structures to adjoining places is to be\ncarried out in consultation6 with the local community. Broad parameters for relocation of\nstructures are included in the EMAP.\n10.  Sensitive and/or Critical Natural Habitats\n21. The Bethuadahari Wildlife Santuary is the only critical natural habitat in the project\nregion.  The wildlife inhabiting the sanctuary are not sensitive to traffic noise, and vehicle\nemissions. In addition, the project highway will not encroach or pass through the sanctuary\nand thus will not result in any potential impacts on its environment and functions.\nB. Environmental Mitigation Action Plan\n22. The EMAP was prepared for the construction and operation stages of the highway\nimprovement works. The initial environmental assessment report along with EMAP is to be\nappended to the construction contracts for implementation.\n23. The broad cost estimate for implementation of the EMAP for the NH 34, SH 10 and\nSH 1 improvement is about $2.83 million, (does not include cost of constructing haul roads),\nwhich works out to 1.05 percent of the investment cost. Adequate funds have been provided\nin the project costs for this purpose.\nC. Institutional Requirements\n24. The institutional requirements for implementation of the EMAP during construction\nand operation stages have been framed. The project Implementation Agency, the Public\nWorks Department Roads will create a project environmental implementation unit (PEIU) for\nthe environmental management and monitoring of all the construction packages. The PEIU\nwill be headed by a senior environmental officer, designated as PEIU manager, who will be\nassisted by four environmental officers (one per package). The officers will be responsible for\nindependent monitoring of EMAP implementation under the directions of the PEIU manager.\nD. Findings\n25. The major findings of the study include the following:\n(i)  The highway improvement works are largely confined to the available right-of-\nway. The marginal land acquisition if any will be restricted to urban stretches,\n                                                          \n6 The Social Impact Assessment Report provides details on the consultations with the local community leaders.", "47\nAppendix 9, page 5\nrail overpasses locations and improvement of the junctions. Even in such\ncase(s), the fresh land acquisition will be limited to 20 m.\n(ii)  The project road sections do not traverse reserve forests, forest areas, and\nsensitive natural habitats; and has no historical or archeologically important\nmonuments and heritage sites.\n(iii)  The  highway  improvement  present  two  environmentally/socially  beneficial\noptions for sourcing the earth for construction works. First is the excavation of\nthe silted drainage channel and river beds of the region; the second is the use\nof fly ash for embankment and other construction works.\n(iv)  The highway improvement works will involve clearing of large number of trees\nwithin the right-of-way. As per the stipulations of GWB, prior permission for\ntree  felling  must  be  obtained  from  the  Directorate  of  Forests,  GWB;  five\nsaplings are to be planted for every tree felled and maintained for at least\nthree years as a compensatory measure.\n(v)  Environmental  mitigation  measures  have  been  identified  for  other  project\nactions,  which  are  likely  to  induce  impacts.  A  control  matrix  showing\nresponsibilities and monitoring frequency of mitigation measures has been\ndefined.

The Project\n1. The West Bengal Corridor Development Project consists of (i) widening and\nimproving about 370 kilometers (km) of the National Highway 34 (NH 34); (ii) upgrading\nand improving 150 km of state highways (SH 1 and SH 10); and (iii) rehabilitating 100\nkm of rural access roads. This Resettlement Plan (RP) presents relevant data related to\nthe project impacts; and outlines the remedial measures, and how and when these\nmeasures  must  be  implemented.  The  Ministry  of  Road  Transport  and  Highways,\nGovernment of India, will be the Executing Agency for the national highway component\nof the Project, and the West Bengal Public Works Road Department (PWRD) for the\nstate highway and rural access components. The Project will be implemented by a\nproject implementation unit (PIU) within the West Bengal PWRD.\nB. Scope of Impacts and Identification of People Affected\n2. As  the  Government  already  owns  the  right-of-way  (ROW)  required  for  the\nimprovement  works  of  NH  34,  state  highways,  and  rural  access  roads,  fresh  land\nacquisition  will  be  minimal  except  for  minor  adjustments  and  straightening  of  the\nalignments and bypasses for SH 1 and SH 10. Despite limited land acquisition, the\nimprovement activities will affect roadside communities such as small shops/businesses\ncharacterized by ribbon development on both sides of the existing highways. These\nsmall  business  enterprises  (SBEs)  are  largely  informal  dwellers/squatters  and\nencroachers, who conduct various types of businesses on the ROW land and provide a\nrange of services linked to the roads and local economies. The SBEs are concentrated\naround  bus/truck  stops,  roadside  markets,  and  major  intersections,  where  traffic\ncongestion is already high. As a result, the proposed improvements will largely affect the\nroadside businesses and communities.\n3. A full census of all potentially affected SBEs and households on the project\ncorridor of impact of NH 34 and SH 1 was conducted in February-March and May 2001.\nThe socioeconomic baseline data for SH 10 was collected in January-February 2000. In\nall, the project roads will likely affect 9,214 SBEs, 1,328 households, and 452 community\nproperties.  Also,  over  4000  SBEs  employees  will  be  affected  by  disruption  and\ntemporary loss of employment. The census team assigned identification numbers to\neach structure likely to be affected on both sides of project road sections (NH 34 and SH\n1). For SH 10, every structure on the corridor of impact was recorded on a plan-profile\ndrawing with identification numbers. Based on consultation with various stakeholders\nand project social analysis, the project engineering team developed improved guidelines\nfor alignment design to minimize displacement, reduce disruption of livelihoods, and\nprovide better management of ROW for future road expansion and development. The\ncensus inventory will be verified and updated based on the actual impact once the road\nalignments and designs are complete.", "49\nAppendix 10, page 2\nC. Resettlement Principles and Entitlements\n4. The  resettlement  principles  adopted  for  this  Project  recognize  the  Land\nAcquisition Act (Act I of 1894) and the Land Acquisition (West Bengal Amendment Act\n(West Bengal Act XIX of 1999). They also comply with the requirements of the Asian\nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  policy  on  involuntary  resettlement.1  The  RP  will  provide\ncompensation  and  resettlement  assistance  to  all  affected  persons  and  businesses,\nincluding the informal dwellers/squatters in the project corridor of impact. In general\nterms, the people affected by the Project will be entitled to four types of compensation\nand assistance: (i) compensation for loss of land and crops/trees, (ii) compensation for\nstructures (residential/commercial) and other immovable assets, (iii) assistance for loss\nof  business/wage  income,  and  (iv)  rebuilding  and/or  restoration  of  community\nresources/facilities.\n5. The  affected  SBEs/households  may  be  entitled  to  a  combination  of\ncompensation  measures  and  resettlement  assistance,  depending  on  the  nature  of\nownership rights of lost assets and scope of the impact, including social and economic\nvulnerability of the people affected. The RP also addresses a number of interrelated\nsociocultural  and  health  issues  that  could  accompany  the  road  widening  and\ndevelopment  \u2013  for  example,  road  safety,  trafficking  of  women,  and  children  and\nAIDS/HIV. In sum, the RP takes an integrated and holistic approach to dealing with\nproject impacts and aims to rebuild lives and livelihoods of those affected by using an\ninnovative ROW management and development approach. It is designed to involve all\nstakeholders, including roadside communities and other user groups, in project planning\nand implementation.\nD. Participation, RP Implementation, and Budget\n6. Public response to the Project is strong and positive because it will improve\ntransportation, bring new opportunities for business, and significant social economic\nbenefits to the local communities. Community consultation and participation played a\nvery important role in selecting project options and improving designs for project roads.\nPIU officials will step up information campaigns and publish brochures on the project\nresettlement  principles  and  entitlements,  payments  procedures,  and  construction\nschedule aimed at social preparation for relocation and resettlement of the affected\nSBEs/households. The PIU will hire two nongovernment organization to help with the\ninformation campaign and consultation program, road safety, trafficking, and AIDS/HIV\nawareness programs in the project area.\n7. The RP will be implemented by the PWRD-PIU. The resettlement organization of\nthe  PIU  will  comprise  a  project  resettlement  officer  in  the  office  of  the  PIU  and\nresettlement officers for each contract packages. The project resettlement officer will be\nresponsible for the day-to-day activities for RP implementation. The PIU will open field\noffices for each civil contract packages, and engage adequate resettlement staff to carry\nout the designated activities of the RP. Resettlement advisory committees will be formed\nto seek inputs from stakeholders in RP decision making and implementation. Grievance\nredress committees will be formed in respective districts to resolve disputes concerning\n                  \n1 ADB. 1998. The Bank\u2019s Policy on Involuntary Resettlement. In Handbook on Resettlement. Appendix 1.\nManila.", "50\nAppendix 10, page 3\ncompensation payments and decrease lengthy litigations. Affected businesses and other\nvulnerable groups, such as women, will be represented in those committees and be\ninvolved  in  the  grievances  resolution  concerning  compensation  and  resettlement\nbenefits.\n8. Resettlement  will  be  generally  completed  prior  to  award  of  the  civil  works\ncontracts. Where some physical construction like building of platforms, etc. is required,\nthe work will be integrated with the civil work contract as provisional sum and be the\nresponsibility of the civil works contractor to make necessary construction as may be\nrequired for resettlement. A time-bound implementation schedule has been prepared in\naccordance  with  the  road  construction  schedule.  The  total  estimated  cost  for\nresettlement operation and management for the Project is Rs.618.5 million ($13.35\nmillion). The Government of West Bengal will provide the entire fund for resettlement.\nE. Monitoring and Evaluation\n9. RP implementation will be supervised and monitored by the PIU in coordination\nwith  the  project  resettlement  officer  and  the  resettlement  advisory  and  grievances\nredress committees. The monitoring will be done both internally and externally. The PIU\nproject director will prepare monthly reports on the progress of RP implementation.\nProject supervision consultants will monitor RP implementation and report on a quarterly\nbasis to PWRD and ADB on the progress of resettlement activities.  A panel of local\nexperts, who will be engaged by PWRD, will conduct independent biannual reviews of\nresettlement  implementation,  and  provide  feedback  to  PWRD  and  ADB  on  the\neffectiveness of RP implementation.", "51\nAppendix 11, page 1\nECONOMIC EVALUATION\nA.  Introduction\n1. The methodology used in the economic evaluation compared the with project situation to\nthat of the without project situation to determine the effects of introducing the Project. The\nProject involves rehabilitation of approximately 370 kilometers (km) of the Barasat-Dalkhola road\non National Highway (NH) 34, improvements to State Highway (SH) 1 between Chakda and\nBangaon (about 40 km), and improvements to SH 10 between Gazol and Hilli (about 110 km).\nThe Project roads pass through five districts: North 24-Parganas, Murshidabad, Nadia, Maldah,\nand  Uttar  Dinajpur.  The  major  towns  through  which  NH  34  passes  include  Barasat,\nKrishnanagar, Baharampur, Farakka, Maldah, and Raiganj. SH 1 and SH 10 connect with NH 34\nand link to the Bangladesh border. The rehabilitation and improvements to the existing NH 34 2-\nlane  road  consist  of  rehabilitating  the  pavement  and  widening  the  road  to  a  7  meter  (m)\npavement with 2.5 m shoulders. A 4-lane scenario was also considered as an alternative for the\nProject. After comparing these two mutually exclusive options, the 4-lane scenario was found to\nbe not economically feasible.1 Therefore the 2-lane alternative, the least-cost alternative, was\nadopted for the Project. For both SH 1 and SH 10 the improvements are to widen the existing\nroads to 7 m with 1.5 m wide paved shoulders.\nB.  Traffic Analysis and Projections\n1. Existing Traffic\n2. For  analysis  purposes,  traffic  volumes  for  five  types  of  motorized  vehicles  were\ndeveloped.2 Traffic data was obtained for each of the project roads, namely NH 34, SH 1, and\nSH 10. The level of traffic on NH 34 was determined by referring to recent Public Works\nDepartment traffic count data. This was compared with figures in other studies that had been\nrecently undertaken to check on the validity of the base information.3 Traffic surveys were also\nundertaken during project preparation.4 The traffic surveys comprised (i) three consecutive day\ntraffic counts at five locations for 24 hours per day, (ii) origin-destination surveys at two locations\nfor 24 hours at each site, and (iii) axle-load measurement at two locations for 24 hours at each\nlocation. The traffic count survey stations selected in the Technical Assistant (TA) were located\nas closely as possible to the survey stations used in the previous TA to enable a comparison\nwith the previous counts. The traffic count survey stations were located at Barasat (km 33),\nKrishnanagar  (km  112),  Baharampur  (km  203),  Farakka  (km  302),  and  Gazol  (km  355).\nSeasonal factors were applied to the traffic counts obtained from the surveys and base year\ntraffic was obtained. Medium-size truck vehicles (2-axle rigid trucks) predominate in the annual\naverage daily traffic. Traffic data for both SH 1 and SH 10 was obtained from a recent study for\nseveral state highways in West Bengal.5 The base year traffic information is shown in Table\nA11.1.\n                  \n1 The widening of the pavement to a 4-lane road with a 14 m wide pavement becomes viable by improving the 2-lane\nroad to a 4-lane road after 2015 when the 2-lane road would be reaching capacity.\n2 Road traffic on the project roads consists of both motorized and nonmotorized vehicles. The ratio of nonmotorized\ntraffic varies along the project road. On average, motorized traffic constitutes about 70 percent of the total traffic.\n3 North-South Corridor in West Bengal, Asian Development Bank, TA No. 3142-IND, Halcrow and Associates, August\n2000.\n4 SSTA No. 3540-IND Economic and Poverty Analysis for the West Bengal Corridor Development Project, April 2001.\n5 Services for West Bengal Roads Project, World Bank Loan No. 4114-IN, BCEOM-RITES Joint Venture.", "52\nAppendix 11, page 2\nTable A11.1: Traffic on the Project Road\n(AADT)\nSection Car Bus Light Medium Heavy Total\nTruck Truck Truck\nNational Highway H34\nBarasat \u2013 Krishnanagar 920 588 587 3,100 12 5,207\nKrishnanagar \u2013 Baharampur 786 868 478 3,277 131 5,540\nBaharampur-Farakka 588 578 343 3,396 99 5,004\nFarakka \u2013 Maldah 572 575 262 3,215 213 4,837\nMaldah \u2013 Raiganj 867 662 353 2,431 210 4,523\nState Highway 1\nChakda - Bangaon 384 238 283 747 14 1,666\nState Highway 10\nGazol - Hili 548 516 615 723 1 2,403\nSource: Feasibility study.\n2. Traffic Forecast\n3. An examination was made of the rate of growth of state gross domestic product (SGDP)\nand district gross domestic product (DGDP). In view of the high historical growth rates and\nconsidering the probable future growth in population and economic activity, the future SGDP and\nDGSP are expected to be high. The growth rates calculated for each of the districts through\nwhich the project road passes ranges from 5.5 percent to 6.2 percent per annum. These growth\nrates have been used over the study period.\n4. The income elasticities derived in previous studies are used in the present analysis; they\nare different for both passenger and freight traffic. The elasticities were further split into car and\nbus traffic and truck traffic, and for different time periods throughout the study period. The car\nand bus income elasticities range from 0.5 to 1.0, and the truck income range from 0.7 to 1.3.\nTransport  elasticity\u2019s  were  calculated  by  different  regions,  which  were  comprised  of  different\ndistricts. Estimates were also made of the change in elasticity over time based on the future growth\nprospects of West Bengal and also on the observations that were made for each region on such\nissues as existing level of traffic flows, future prospects of economic growth, and regional disparities\nin economic development.\n5. The growth rate in DGDP has been used in conjunction with the income elasticity of\ndemand to derive the future growth in traffic. The growth rates obtained by region and by the\ndistricts within a region are shown in Table A11.2.\n6. The growth rates in Table A11.2 are then applied to each of the sections of the project\nroad traffic estimates (Table A11.1) depending on which region and district the road section lies\nin. In cases where road sections cross district boundaries, the traffic growth rates have been\nweighted accordingly.", "53\nAppendix 11, page 3\nTable A11.2: Traffic Growth Rates\n(% per annum)\nRegion / District Vehicle 2001- 2005- 2010- 2015- 2020-\nType 2005 2010 2015 2020 2025\nRegion 1 Cars   3.50   3.50 4.00 4.00 4.80\nN 24 Parganas Bus   2.75   2.75 2.75 2.75 2.75\nTruck   4.00   4.00 4.00 4.80 4.80\nRegion 2 Cars   6.00   6.70 6.70 6.70 6.70\nNadia, Bus   5.90   5.90 6.60 6.60 6.60\nMurshidabad Truck   8.00   8.70 8.70 9.40 9.40\nRegion 3 Cars 11.00 10.50 9.90 9.30 9.30\nMaldah, Bus   4.60   4.60 5.50 5.80 5.80\nUttar Dinajpur Truck   8.00   8.00 8.00 8.00 8.00\nSource: Feasibility study.\n7. Based on the base year traffic levels (Table A11.1) and the rates of traffic growth (Table\nA11.2), the traffic forecasts for each road section were calculated (Table A11.3). The traffic\ngrowth calculated is for normal traffic growth. Generated traffic, that traffic which did not travel\nbefore, but now as a result of the improvement of the road decides to travel as it finds a benefit\nin doing so, has not been calculated; and no generated traffic is assumed in the economic\nevaluations.

Subregional Prospects\n8. The  West  Bengal  corridor  is  of  prime  importance  to  increasing  subregional  trade\nbetween, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India and Nepal. NH 34 is the major road link to Nepal and\nBhutan.  SH  1  and  SH  10  connect  NH  34  to  the  Bangladesh  border.  The  upgrading  and\nrehabilitation of these three roads, which constitute the Project, is expected to promote increased\ntrade within the subregion. The improvement of these linkages, NH 34, SH 1, and SH 10, is an\nimportant first step to increasing international trade and subregional cooperation.  Approximately\n70 to 80 percent of India\u2019s exports to Bangladesh take place through the border towns of", "55\nAppendix 11, page 5\nPetrapole (SH 1), Hilli (SH 10), and Changrabandah, with Petrapole being the principal route.\nCongestion on both SH 1 and SH 10 occurs due to the narrow road width, which is restricting the\nflow of international traffic. For international traffic between India and Bangladesh to increase,\nthese routes need to be improved and widened to improve traffic flow.\n9. A true measure of the intraregional trade is hampered by unreliable data and unrecorded\ncross-border trade. However, certain points can be noted. First, the share of intra-South Asian\nGrowth Quadrangle trade in total trade has increased modestly from 1.3 percent in 1985 to 2.8\npercent in 1995. In value terms, intraregional trade was approximately $506 million in 1985 and\n$2,451 in 1995. Secondly, the share of trade of each country in intraregional exports and imports\nvaries significantly across countries. While in 1995, Bangladesh and Nepal met 15 and 33\npercent of their import requirements from the region, India met only 0.2 percent. The trend is\nopposite as far as exports are concerned. Bangladesh\u2019s share of exports to the region has\ndecreased from 3.5 percent in 1985 to 1.4 percent in 1995, while that of India has increased from\n2.2 percent to 3.5 percent. Nepal\u2019s export to India have increased significantly in recent years\nand in 1995 was 18.0 percent compared with 12 percent in 1990. In 2000, imports from India into\nNepal were of the magnitude of 38 percent and exports approximately 44 percent. In 1999 the\nvolume of freight traffic moving from India to Bangladesh on the Benapole (SH 1 border point) to\nDhaka is estimated at 891,000 metric tons and the traffic from Hilli (SH 10 border point) to Dhaka\nat 614,000 tons.\n10. For trade to increase several important factors are necessary. Effective infrastructure\nlinks must offer convenient access to markets, and be supported by rational transport and transit\nprocedures  across  borders,  and  progressive  trade  facilitation  policies.  The  present  Project\nthrough its improvements to NH 34, SH 1 and SH 10 would alleviate the bottleneck that exists on\nthis route, lower transport costs, and stimulate higher volumes of freight movement to other\ncountries in the subregion.\nC.  Economic Evaluation\n1. General\n11. The economic analysis of the Project, comprising NH 34 between Barasat and Raiganj,\nSH 1 between Chakda and Bangaon, and SH 10 between Gazol and Hilli compared scenarios\nwith and without the Project. Without the Project, traffic would experience high transport costs\ndue to deteriorating road conditions and worsening traffic congestion. With the Project, transport\ncosts would be lower because the Project would improve road conditions.\n12. The economic analysis considered the estimated benefits and costs of the Project over\n20 years of operation after the completion of civil works. Project benefits and costs were valued\nin 2001 constant prices. Benefits and costs in financial prices were adjusted to economic prices\nby deducting taxes and duties, and applying a standard conversion factor of 0.80 to nontraded\nlocal currency costs.\n2. Costs\n13. The economic costs of implementing the Project were based on the financial costs of civil\nworks, physical contingencies, land acquisition and resettlement, and construction supervision;\nexcluding  price  contingencies  and  interest  during  construction.  Incremental  operation  and\nmaintenance costs were calculated as the difference in O&M requirements with and without the\nProject. In the without\u2013project scenario, the road is assumed to receive routine maintenance and", "56\nAppendix 11, page 6\nan  overlay  every  5  years  as  this  is  the  current  practice.  This  overlay  has  a  low  strength\ncoefficient and therefore necessitates the frequent overlay periods. The with-project scenario\nincludes  routine  maintenance  and  an  overlay  to  international  standards  after  10  years  of\noperation in 2015. No residual value was considered at the end of the project life. For SH 1 and\nSH 10 the existing maintenance practice is to reseal the pavement every 5 years and to overlay\nthe pavement after 10 years. This has been adopted as the without-project scenario for both SH\n1 and SH 10. The with-project scenario for both SH 1 and SH 10 includes routine maintenance\nand an overlay every 10 years of operation. As with NH 34, no residual value was considered at\nthe end of the project road life.\n3. Benefits\n14. Due to the improved road surface, the Project would realize benefits in the reduction of\nvehicle operating costs (VOC), which VOC were calculated with and without the Project for each\nyear of the analysis period for traffic in the five vehicle categories. VOCs are influenced by\nvehicle speed, the horizontal and vertical alignment of the road, and the physical condition of the\nroad surface,6 in addition to vehicle type, price, age, and load. The VOCs were calculated using\nthe  HDM III model.7 Local information was provided as much as possible to obtain results that\nare specific to India. The input data was based on 2001 prices and is net of taxes, duties, and\nother charges. The output of the model includes physical quantities of consumption and speed,\nand the associated VOC per predefined unit of 1,000 vehicle-km. VOC estimates for the five\nvehicles types and international road roughness index (IRI) values are shown in Table A11.4.\n15.

Time savings have not been evaluated in the analysis, as in economic theory the savings\nin time that take place would have to be put to another productive use so that they can be\nincluded in the evaluation. However, an estimate has been made of the reduction in time that\nwould take place after the introduction of the project road. The change in average speeds in the\nwithout-project case to the with-project case trip times are estimated to fall by 30-40 percent. The\ncalculated trip time from Barasat to Raiganj on NH 34 at the present time is approximately 12\nhours (average speed 30 km/hour [kph]). After the project is introduced, the average speed will\nincrease to 50 kph and the trip time will be about 7 hours.\n4. Economic Internal Rate of Return\n17. The economic evaluation of the Project compared the benefits and costs for the with-and\nwithout- project scenarios. The project capital costs are assumed to be incurred in 2001-2005,\nand that the project benefits to start in 2006 and be available for 20 years to 2025. The benefits\nare based on VOC savings, in economic prices. These benefits were compared with the road\nimprovement and maintenance costs to calculate the economic internal rate of return (EIRR). All\nbenefits and costs were estimated net of duties and taxes, and are expressed in constant 2001\nprices. The EIRR was estimated for three contract packages for NH 34, namely package A\n(Barasat-Baharampur, km 31-km 193), package B (Baharampur-Farakka, km 193-km 297), and\npackage C (Farakka-Raiganj, km 297-km 398) and for the project road as a whole. The EIRR for\nthe individual contract packages ranged from 18.8 to 25.2 percent, and the EIRR for the whole of\nNH 34 was 23.1 percent. The EIRR for SH 10 from Gazol to Hili (package D) was estimated at\n16.6 percent and SH 1 from Chakda to Bangaon (package E) was calculated as 15.7 percent. A\nsummary of the results of the economic evaluations is shown in Table A11.6. The benefit and\ncost stream for NH 34 as a whole are shown in Table A11. 7,8 and for SH 10 and SH 1 are\nshown in Table A11.8 and Table A11.9. The EIRR for the Project as a whole, i.e., NH 34, SH 1,\nand SH 10 is shown in Table A11.10.

Distribution of Benefits\n19. The estimated direct benefits of NH 34, SH 10, and SH 1 to the economy are Rs4,804\nmillion, Rs643 million, and Rs140 million respectively in present value (PV) terms. The direct\nbenefits for the Project as a whole are Rs5,587 million in PV terms. These figures simply\nrepresent the sum of the PV of benefits to passengers, freight users, vehicle owners, and the\nGovernment. These are conservative estimates, because only direct benefits of the Project have\nbeen considered. The distribution analysis has been based upon the existing situation in the\nroad transport industry, and an estimate of how this will develop in the future. At the time of the\nAppraisal Mission the freight transport industry was fully competitive in determining freight rates,\nbut  the  passenger  transport  industry  was  regulated  and  fares  are  set  by  the  state.  The\npassenger transport industry is expected to be gradually deregulated in the future. Freight\nowners and operators presently pass on part of the savings they receive through lower vehicle\noperating costs to freight users. Bus owners and operators will pass on more of the savings they\nreceive through reduced vehicle operating costs once the industry is fully deregulated. Table\nA11.12 shows the estimated benefits for each category of beneficiaries for NH 34, SH 10, SH 1,\nand for the Project as a whole.\n                  \n9 The switching value shows the percentage increase in a cost variable (or decline in a benefit variable) required for\nthe net present value (NPV) to become zero, which is the same as the EIRR reducing to the cutoff level of 12\npercent.", "64\nAppendix 11, page 14\nTable A11.12: Distribution of Net Benefits\n(Rs.

The distribution of net benefits to passenger users in Table A11.12 is relatively low for\ntwo main reasons; (i) the composition of vehicle traffic on the project roads is predominantly\nnonpassenger, bus passenger traffic accounts for only 14 percent of all traffic on the project\nroads, and (ii) the VOC savings for passenger traffic, cars, and buses, is relatively small when\ncompared with the VOC savings for freight traffic; for example, the discounted VOC savings for\npassenger traffic on NH 34 over the project life only represents 7 percent of total VOC savings.\n21. The benefits to both passenger and freight users will also be distributed between the\npeople in the direct influence of the project area and those outside the project area. In terms of\nthe distribution of benefits in the project area, a recent study found that approximately 80 percent\nof all vehicles originated or were destined for the districts of the project area, the remaining traffic\noriginated or was destined for other parts of India or neighboring countries. Therefore 80 percent\nof the benefits shown in Table A11.12 are likely to accrue to the people in the project area. In\nterms of passenger benefits, which represents benefits to bus users, a large part of this benefit\nwill be passed to the poor in the project area as these are the people who use public transport.\nThe benefits to freight users will be distributed between entrepreneurs who tend to purchase\nfreight services after they have bought in bulk the produce of several different farmers, and also\nbetween some of the rural poor who ship their own agricultural produce directly.  The largest part\nof net benefits go to the vehicle owners themselves. Vehicle owners consist of car, bus, and\ntruck owners and operators.\n22. Indirect benefits will include the increased trade and economic activity that are partly\ninduced by the improved roads. The size of these indirect benefits depends on how the regional\nand national economies grow over the Project\u2019s time horizon. These indirect benefits will provide\nadditional employment opportunities, which will impact the poor and therefore increase their\nincome levels. Additional indirect benefits to the Project will be obtained through the Rural\nAccess Roads component of the Project (Appendix 12). These rural access roads will improve\nfarm-to-market access, which will in turn lead to additional economic activity in agriculture and\nagricultural-related industries.", "65\nAppendix 12, page 1\n`POVERTY REDUCTION IMPACT OF THE PROJECT\nA.  Introduction\n1. Transport  has  direct  impacts  on  the  personal  welfare  of  all  income  groups.\nImprovements in transport not only provide people with more convenient access to a broad\nrange of socioeconomic opportunities, but also have strong income effects by lowering transport\ncost and hence the prices of consumer goods and services. In these ways, transport makes a\npervasive contribution to improve personal welfare. Understanding the transmission of these\nimpacts is especially important in assessing transport\u2019s direct contribution to poverty reduction.\nFor the poor, the lack of affordable access deprives them of the ability to take advantage of job\nopportunities and even of very basic social services. Reliable access to schools and health\nservices for the poor contributes directly to their accumulation of human capital, which is a key\nfactor in sustainable poverty reduction.\n2. A  poverty  reduction  impact  study  was  carried  out  to  assess  the  poverty  reduction\nimpacts of the Project. The study was undertaken between January and March 2001, had the\nfollowing components:\n(i )  Conduct poverty mapping of the affected districts based on existing household\nand income data (including data from recent studies).\n(ii )  Identify  areas  of  highest  unemployment,  underemployment,  income  sources,\noccupations  of  the  people  living  closest  to  the  proposed  road,  proximity  of\nproposed junctions to communities.\n(ii i)  Identify available link and access roads, and their proximity to poor populations,\nand  analyze  how  limitations  in  access  to  transportation  and  transportation\nservices contribute to poverty in the project hinterland.\n3. The main findings of the study are that the Project will lead to an improved standard of\nliving, and reduced poverty and unemployment in its area of influence. This will be achieved by\nenhancing  household  mobility  and  expanding  economic  opportunities  in  the  project  area,\nparticularly in agriculture and small-scale industry.\nB.  Poverty in the Project Area\n1. General Context\n4. Huge challenges are posed by India\u2019 s low per capita income, $453 in fiscal year (FY)\n2000, and a population of about 1 billion. Despite some progress, access to basic social\nservices  such  as  education  and  health,  remain  widespread.  While  the  proportion  of  the\npopulation living below the poverty line declined from 50 percent in the 1970s to about 39\npercent in 1987/88, and further to 26 percent by 2000,1 the absolute number of poor doubled\nfrom 164 million in 1951 to 320 million by 1993-94 mainly due to the increase in population from\n600 million in the early 1970s to more than 950 million in the mid-1990s.\n                                                          \n1 Poverty incidence in India is measured as the percentage of the population living below a well-defined poverty line\n(based on a consumption level equivalent to a daily food intake of 2,100-2,400 calories in urban and rural areas\nData on household expenditure from the national sample surveys (NSS), was used. Full NSS rounds, covering\nabout 100,000 households, are conducted every 4-6 years, most recently in 1999/2000. \u201cThin sample\u201d surveys,\nwith substantially smaller sample size and reduced scope, are conducted annually.", "66\nAppendix 12, page 2\n2.  Project Area\n5. The project area covers five districts, namely, North 24-Parganas, Maldah, Murshidabad,\nNadia, and Uttar Dinajpur. The population of these districts is approximately 19.5 million, which\nis about 29 percent of the total population of West Bengal. Of the 19.5 million, approximately 76\npercent live in rural areas. The estimated district domestic product of the five districts in 1995/96\nat 1980/81 constant prices are as follows: North 24-Parganas, Rs19,381 million; Murshidabad,\nRs11903 million; Nadia, Rs9,587 million; Maldah, Rs5,840 million; and, Uttar Dinajpur, Rs3,901\nmillion. Per capita income varied between the districts, ranging from Rs1,776 in Uttar Dinajpur\nto Rs2,351 in North 24-Parganas.\n6. The poor are classified as those whose annual (5-member) family income lie below\nRs15,000 per annum as defined by the government of West Bengal. Recent estimates by the\nNational Sample Survey Organization for 2000 show that approximately 27 percent of people in\nWest Bengal are poor, i.e., 1 percent higher than for India as a whole, 26 percent. From recent\ndata in West Bengal the following estimates of the number of poor in the districts through which\nthe project road passes are shown in Table A12.1.\nTable A12.1: Percentage of Population By District Below The Poverty Line\nDistrict %\nNorth 24 Parganas 32\nNadia 31\nMurshidabad 31\nMaldah 33\nUttar Dinajpur 32\nSource:  Feasibility study.\n7. Among the five districts, records show that the highest proportion of poor population is in\nMaldah, 33 percent, followed by Uttar Dinajpur and North 24 Parganas at 32 per cent, and\nNadia and Murshidabad at 31 percent. Approximately one third of the population in each district\nare poor. This is approximately equivalent to 6.4 million people in all the project road districts.\n8. A  profile  of  the  project  area  was  conducted  by  undertaking  household  surveys\nthroughout the districts. A total of 522 households were surveyed2 to obtain information on\nemployment, unemployment, landholding, sources of income, educational status, and access to\ninfrastructure facilities.  The major findings from this profile show that unemployment is high in\neach  of  the  districts  and  averaged  65  percent  of  those  interviewed.  The  predominant\nemployment sector is agriculture. Income ranges varied between districts. In North 24-Parganas\n45 percent of those surveyed had a monthly income of between Rs500-1,000. In Nadia, 42\npercent of the surveyed people had the same income range. The figures were similar for the\nother districts. The income data collected in the surveys confirmed the high levels of poor\npeople as shown in Table A12.1.\n                                                          \n2 The household interviews were undertaken under TA 3540-IND: Economic and Poverty Analysis for the West\nBengal Corridor Development Project, for $150,000, approved on 13 November 2000.", "67\nAppendix 12, page 3\nC. Social and Poverty Reduction Initiatives\n1. Government\n9. As poverty reduction is a major challenge faced by the Government, poverty reduction\nprograms are central to the Government\u2019s intervention in development programs. The Ministry\nof Rural Development has been acting as a catalyst to effect change by implementing a wide\nspectrum  of  programs  aimed  at  poverty  reduction,  employment  generation,  infrastructure\ndevelopment  and  social  security.  Over  the  years,  with  the  experience  gained  in  program\nimplementation and in response to the felt needs of the rural poor, the existing programs have\nbeen modified and new programs introduced. The Ninth Five-Year Plan strategy to reduce rural\npoverty through direct intervention is based on the experience gained in the earlier plans and\nconsists of a number of rural development programs.\n10. Two of these programs are briefly described here.3\na. Integrated Rural Development Program\n11. The Integrated Rural Development Program (IRDP) started in 1980/81 and continued as\na major self-employment scheme in the Ninth Five-Year Plan until 1 April 1999 when it was\nrestructured and merged with Swaranjayanti Gram Swarozgar Yojana. The major objective of\nthe IRDP was to provide self-employment to the rural poor through acquisition of productive\nassets or appropriate skills that would generate additional income on a sustained basis to\nenable them to cross the poverty line. Identified rural families were expected to move above the\npoverty line by providing them with productive assets and inputs in the primary, secondary, or\ntertiary sectors through financial assistance by Government subsidy and credit from financial\nInstitutions.\nb. Development of Women and Children in Rural Areas\n12. Development of Women and Children in Rural Areas (DWCRA) aimed to strengthen the\ngender component of the IRDP. It was initially launched as a pilot program in 50 selected\ndistricts with United Nation\u2019s International Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF) cooperation to strengthen\nthe women\u2019s component of poverty reduction programs. The program was later extended to all\nthe districts of the country. The objective of the program was to raise the income level of women\nof  poor  households  to  enable  their  organized  participation  in  social  development  toward\neconomic self-reliance. Through the strategy of group formation, women\u2019s access to basic\nservices was to be improved, such as to health, education, child care, nutrition, water, and\nsanitation. During the Eighth Five-Year Plan, the program benefited about 2.3 million women\nwho were assisted at an expenditure of Rs.1,910 million.\n2. West Bengal\n13. Rural development funding throughout West Bengal amounted to Rs 4,089 million in FY\n2000-2001. Expenditure in previous years was Rs3,663 million in FY1999/2000, and Rs2,780\nmillion in FY1998/99. The Public Works Department is undertaking work in constructing rural\n                                                          \n3 All of the Government poverty reduction programs are described more fully in TA 3540-IND: Economic and Poverty\nAnalysis for the West Bengal Corridor Development Project, Volume II \u2013 Poverty Analysis, April 2001.", "68\nAppendix 12, page 4\nroads  under  the  aegis  of  the  Rural  Development  Department.  A  road  program  has  been\nintroduced to link all villages with a population of 1,500 and above, and 50 percent of the\nvillages with a population between 1,000 to 1,500 over a 20-year period.4 Rural road schemes\npresently under construction are estimated to have a total project cost of Rs4,974 million ($108\nmillion). These roads total an approximate length of 2,317 km, and include 221 individual roads.\nOther rural infrastructure is also being undertaken in the project area, and includes irrigation\nwork, improvements to canals, school buildings, sericulture projects, and other small-scale\nimprovements to rural infrastructure.\n14. In the rural areas of six less developed districts of North Bengal, namely, Coochbehar,\nDakshin Dinajpur, Darjeeling, Jalpaiguri, Malda, and Uttar Dinajpur (the project road passes\nthrough two of these districts) special provisions have been made for implementing schemes\nrelating  to  the  construction  and  improvement  of  roads,  bridges,  culverts,  embankments,\ndrainage  facilities,  sanitation,  and  other  infrastructure  facilities.  The  total  2000/01  plan\nexpenditure for the restoration and development of roads in these districts is Rs170 million. The\nschemes under this program are implemented by the Zilla and Mahakuma parishads. The\nfollowing are taken into account when devising each project:\n(i)   The entire outlay is spent on the rural people of North Bengal districts.\n(ii)   Employment generation is the main objective of the program, and labor\nintensive schemes are preferred.\n(iii)   Environmental needs will be safeguarded during implementation of the\nschemes.\n15. Besides road programs in West Bengal, several other internationally funded projects in\ninfrastructure and social development are underway; several have direct impacts on the poverty\nreduction. The Netherlands Government has instituted projects in irrigation, soil conservation,\nand soil improvement in the north of West Bengal. The World Bank is conducting work in the\nagriculture sector, power sector, and schemes in the development of the health sector. The\nUnited  States  Agency  for  International  Development  (USAID)  has  supported  programs  to\npromote health services, and food aid grants for the poor. The United Kingdom is helping to\nreduce poverty; tackle environmental problems; and promote the economic, social, political and\nlegal status of women in all sectors. Japan attaches high significance to poverty reduction\nprograms with a focus on medical care and health, agriculture, and rural development.\nD. Rural Access Roads\n16. The improvement of about 100 km of rural access roads under the Project will increase\nboth the economic way of life (income poverty) and the social way of life (human poverty) of the\npoor in the project area. Firstly, improving the rural access roads and enabling farmers to gain\naccess to markets more efficiently will probably increase the size of farmers\u2019 agricultural output.\nFor example, if it takes the farmer 1 hour to get to market by using an ox-cart with one load of\nagricultural produce, the farmer is more likely to use motorized transport if a road exists and\ntransport agricultural produce in bulk, which will now take only 10 minutes. This increase in the\nfarmer\u2019s output generates additional income, which is spent on other goods and services within\nthe project area. Secondly, the improvement in accessibility to the agricultural area will also\n                                                          \n4 In the Ninth FiveYear Plan, the target is to construct 300 kilomenter of road connecting 800 villages.", "69\nAppendix 12, page 5\nproduce ease of access to other facilities. For example the introduction of electricity supply into\nthe area will be easier due to the improved access road. Access to better water facilities may\nalso  occur,  as  may  improvements  in  communication  systems,  and  health  and  education\nfacilities.  Thirdly,  more  intensive  agricultural  production  methods  may  increase  due  to  the\nreduced cost of supply of agricultural inputs, e.g., fertilizer, etc.\n17. The selection of rural access roads that should be improved will be based on several\ncriteria. These include\n(i)   population served by the rural access road,\n(ii)   connectivity to market centers,\n(iii)   agricultural activity in the area,\n(iv)   industrial activity in the area, and\n(v)   percentage of population below the poverty line.5\n18. Most of the existing rural access roads have a width of 3.5 to 3.8 meters and are in a\nbad state of repair. During the monsoon season travel along these roads becomes difficult. The\nimprovements under the Project will increase the width of these roads to 5\u20135.5 meters and\nprovide paved shoulders of 1 meter.

Poverty Impact of the Project\n19. The starting point for the impact assessment of the project road was at the community\nlevel during the course of the household and group discussion interviews. People were asked\nwhat they thought the Project would do for the area and what their fears about the Project were.\nDuring the course of the household interviews, a community-based assessment was made by\nconducting group meetings (separately for men and women) to determine what the feelings\nwere toward the planned Project, and also to obtain information on what the participants thought\nmay be accomplished and the benefits that would be produced by the Project.\n20. In terms of the household and the focus group meetings, the major responses and\nvoluntary opinions highlighted several major items that people thought would be accomplished\nby improving the project road. A summary of the main findings from the surveys and other\ndevelopment impacts of the Project are summarized in Table A12.3.\nTable A12.3: Summary of Development Impacts\nImpact Benefits\nAccess to markets The main cause of poverty in the project road area,\nparticularly NH 34, is the lack of market accessibility for\nfarmers. Better roads mean more reliable and cheaper\ntransportation of agricultural produce to markets, as well\nas better access to markets. With the incorporation of\nrural access roads in the Project, this will ensure a more\nreliable access to markets and will lead to an increase in\nproduction of agricultural produce.\nRoad  construction  and  maintenance  employment Local labor in the rural areas will be able to increase\nopportunities their income during the road construction period of the\nProject by being employed as unskilled laborers. This\nwill reduce both income poverty and human poverty by\nenabling the employed laborers to purchase additional\nconsumer goods. This benefit is expected to produce\nbetween 4 to 5 million person-days of work during the\nconstruction  period.  There  will  also  be  employment\nopportunities  for  women.a  During  the  construction\nprocess unskilled labor could be trained to follow on the\nproject construction phase with the proper maintenance\ntechniques. This is particularly relevant for rural roads.\nAccess to educational facilities Better access to educational facilities has the possibility\nof reducing illiteracy in the project area. The present\nilliteracy rate in the project area is 36 percent for males\nand 54 percent for females. Improvements of access to\nlearning institutions has shown in other studies that the\nrate of attendance has increased, which has directly lead\nto a reduction in the rate of illiteracy.b Currently, the\naverage student-teacher ratio in the villages along the\nproject road is around 150 to 1.", "72\nAppendix 12, page 8\nImpact Benefits\nIncreased mobility Increase in mobility enables the movement of people in\nsearch  of  employment.  With  the  cheaper  cost  of\ntransport the movement of labor in search of seasonal\noccupations  during  periods  of  agricultural  slack  will\nimprove. The Project will facilitate labor mobility to other\nareas in search of work. Moreover, lack of affordable\naccess  deprives  the  poor  of  the  opportunity  to  take\nadvantage of jobs and even of very basic social services.\nReliable  access  to  schools  and  health  services  will\nenable the poor to accumulate human capital, which is a\nkey factor in sustainable poverty reduction.\nImproved quality of life An  improvement  in  the  standard  of  living  through\naccessibility to other services will produce a fall in the\nlevel of human poverty in the project area and improve\nthe quality of life. The improvement of the project roads\nwill enable the poor in the influence area of the road\ngreater accessibility to other infrastructure services, for\nexample, schools, hospitals, etc. An improvement in the\nProject roads will decrease this trip time and ensure that\nwhen medical facilities are required they can be reached\nefficiently. Improvements on the project road not only\nprovide people with more convenient access to a broad\nrange of socioeconomic opportunities, but will also have\na strong income effect by lowering transport costs and\nhence  the  prices  of  consumer  goods  and  services.\nTherefore, it will contribute to improving personal welfare\nfor the rural poor found in the districts of NH 34, SH 1,\nand SH 10.\nIncrease in employment opportunities The increase in the demand for agricultural products and\nthe  expansion  of  the  service  sector  to  satisfy  this\ndemand  will  create  employment  within  the  transport\nsector for the rural poor. Due to the increase in demand\nfor agricultural products opportunities for work for drivers\nof  both  motorized  and  nonmotorized  transport  will\nincrease, and more labor will be required for loading and\nunloading  vehicles.  This  expansion  in  the  transport\nsector will necessitate an increase in businesses that\nservice and repair transport vehicles, e.g., repair shops,\ngarages, etc., which will also provide more employment\nopportunities.\nGender Women use nonmotorized transport considerably, e.g.,\ncycle-rickshaws. Due to the project improvements and\nthe widening of NH 34, SH 1, and SH 10, more road\nspace will be available for nonmotorized transport; this\nshould lead to an increase in the usage of this form of\ntransport. Leading from this, the accessibility of women\nto better health facilities, educational facilities for their\nchildren, etc. will improve.", "73\nAppendix 12, page 9\nImpact Benefits\nReduction in vehicle operating cost A large part of the traffic on the road is freight traffic\n(approximately 80 percent of all vehicles are trucks). The\nmain commodity carried is agricultural produce. A saving\nto the vehicle operator of the freight company through\nthe reduction in vehicle operation cost (VOC) may be\npassed on to the individual farmer or shipper in the form\nof lower freight rates. This will also reduce the cost of the\nproduct as its transportation charge has declined. The\nrural access roads that lead to NH 34 are the areas that\nproduce  agricultural  products.  The  fall  in  VOC  of\nagricultural product movement will lead the farmer to\nincrease production. In a similar way the VOC savings to\nbus companies may produce a fall in passenger fares.\na For example in Chad, women sold food and water to the labor force working on the road and increased their daily\nincome.\nb A World Bank study on a road project in Morocco revealed that a major impact of the project was on girls\u2019\nenrollment in primary education, which more than trebled in the project zones a few years after completion of the\nproject."], "metadata": {"CreationDate": "D:20011120152259", "Producer": "Acrobat Distiller 3.01 for Windows", "Author": "j3m", "Creator": "ADOBEPS4.DRV Version 4.10", "Title": "Microsoft Word - R232-01.doc", "ModDate": "D:20011212113241+08'00'"}}
