The  Indian  state  of  West\nBengal is strategically located to play a pivotal and\ncatalytic  role  in  promoting  subregional  economic\ncooperation and reducing poverty in the subregion.\nGood  transport  infrastructure  is  recognized  as  a\nprerequisite and foundation on which governments\ncan plan and implement their economic and social\ndevelopment  programs.  The  development  of  the\nWest  Bengal  Corridor  with  the  improvement  of\nremove  a  critical\naccess  and  capacity  will \nbottleneck \nfreight  and\nthe  northern  parts  of  West\npassengers \nBengal;  the  northeastern  states  of  India;  and\nneighboring Bangladesh, Bhutan, and Nepal to the\nports of Kolkata and Haldia.\n\nthe  movement  of \n\nin \nfrom \n\nCategory  B.  An  initial  environmental  examination\nwas  undertaken  and  the  summary  is  a  core\nappendix.\n\nThe  north-south  transport  corridor  in  West  Bengal\n(West Bengal corridor) extends from Haldia port via\nKolkata  (also  a  river  port)  to  the  northern  parts  of\nWest Bengal. In northern West Bengal, the corridor\ndivides into routes to Nepal and Sikkim in the west;\nand Assam, Bhutan, and the northeastern states of\nIndia  in  the  east.  Along  the  corridor,  are  several\neastward links to Bangladesh. A large portion of the\nWest  Bengal  corridor  and  the  eastward  links  to\nBangladesh  are  in  urgent  need  of  improvement\nfrom the current deteriorated two-lane, intermediate\nlane  and  single-lane  standard.  National  Highway\n(NH)  34,  which  forms  the  spine  of  the  transport\nsystem in the corridor, provides the nearest access\nto  ports  (Kolkata  and  Haldia)  for  the  northeastern\nstates of India and neighboring Bhutan and Nepal,\nwhich  are  landlocked.  Two  state  highways  provide\nlinks from the border with Bangladesh to the north-\nsouth corridor and the Indian national road network\n(map p.vii). An efficient transport system along the\n\n\fiii\n\nnorth-south  corridor  will  not  only  provide  the  basis\nfor economic growth and poverty reduction in West\nBengal,  but  will  also  have  significant  implications\nfor improving subregional economic cooperation by\nincreasing trade and other economic activities. The\nability  of  regions  and  countries  to  grow  rapidly\ndepends on their capacity to link with regional and\nimproved\nglobal  markets.  Connectivity \ntransport  has  important  implications  for  poverty\nreduction  by  offering  new  economic  opportunities\nthrough  better  market \nincreased\nemployment possibilities.\n\nlinkages  and \n\nthrough \n\nfor \n\ntransport \n\nfinancing  and \n\nIn  1998,  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)\nprovided  technical  assistance  (TA)  to  assist  the\nGovernment of West Bengal in preparing a strategy\nand  investment  plan  for  the  development  of  the\nnorth-south  corridor.  The  TA  study,  which  was\ncompleted  in  June  2000,  identified  a  number  of\ninfrastructure\nhigh-priority  multimodal \ncomponents \nimplementation\nthrough  a  mixture  of  government  budget  and\npublic-private  partnerships.  The  highest  priority\ncomponent in terms of economic development and\npoverty  reduction  impacts,  strategic  importance,\nand suitability for public funding is the improvement\nof  NH  34,  which  is  the  artery  of  the  north-south\ntransport corridor, and the eastward connections to\nthe  border  with  Bangladesh.  Two  other  priority\ncomponents,  the  connections  between  Haldia  and\nKolkata  and  the  national  highway  network,  are\nbeing  examined  through  detailed  feasibility  studies\nfunded by the National Highways Authority of India\nand will be considered for ADB financing under the\nnext  phase  of  corridor  development.  Meanwhile,\ntwo other corridor sections with potential for private\nparticipation  are  being  developed  as  public-private\npartnership projects.\n\nThe  objective  of  the  Project  is  to  support  the\ndevelopment  of  a  corridor  in  West  Bengal  to\npromote  subregional  economic  activities,  reduce\npoverty,  and  facilitate  trade  by  removing  critical\ntransport\ncapacity  constraints  and \nefficiency.  Because  of  the  strategic  location  of  the\nnorth-south corridor, an improved transport system\nwill  facilitate  subregional  economic  cooperation,\nand enhance the mobility of rural communities, thus\nsupporting  rural  development  and  increasing  the\nearnings of low-income groups.\n\nimproving \n\nObjectives and Scope\n\n\fiv\n\nThe Project will (i) enhance access along the north-\nsouth  corridor  by  improving  about  370  kilometers\n(km) of NH 34; (ii) upgrade subregional connectivity\nby  improving  about  150  km  of  state  highways  that\nconnect the corridor to the border with Bangladesh;\nand  (iii)  provide  rural  communities  with  access  to\nmarkets,  schools,  hospitals,  other  social  services,\nand  employment  opportunities  by  rehabilitating\nabout 100 km of rural access roads. Through policy\ndialogue  carried  out  during  Project  processing,  a\ncorridor  and  sector  development  framework  was\ndeveloped \ncorridor\ndevelopment  and  management  practices;  and  (ii)\nimprove  the  policy  environment  for  the  efficient\ndelivery  of  transport  infrastructure  in  West  Bengal.\nThe Project will also strengthen environmental and\nsocial  governance  through  mitigation  measures  in\nProject design, construction, and operation.\n\nto  promote \n\nsound \n\n(i) \n\nCost Estimates\n\nItem\nRight-of-Way\nCivial Works\nConsulting Services\nProject Management\nContingencies\nInterest During Construction\n\nTotal\n\nFinancing Plan\n\nForeign\nExchange\n\n0.0\n147.4\n12.6\n0.0\n26.5\n17.5\n\n204.0\n\nSource\n\nForeign\nExchange\n\nLocal\nCurrency\n\nADB\n204.0\nGovernment\n0.0\n204.0\nTotal\nADB = Asian Development Bank.\n\n6.0\n113.0\n119.0\n\nLocal\nCurrency\n18.6\n79.3\n2.9\n4.6\n13.6\n0.0\n\n($ million)\nTotal\nCost\n18.6\n226.7\n15.5\n4.6\n40.1\n17.5\n\n119.0\n\n323.0\n\nTotal\nCost\n\n210.0\n113.0\n323.0\n\n($ million)\n\nPercentage\n\n65\n35\n100\n\nLoan Amount and Terms\n\nA  loan  of  $210  million  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital\nresources  will  be  provided  under  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-\nbased  loan  facility.

In 1998,\nthe Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided technical assistance (TA)1 to assist the Government\nof  West  Bengal  (GWB)  to  prepare  a  strategy  and  investment  plan  for  developing  a  north-south\ncorridor.  The  TA  study,  which  was  completed  in  June  2000,  identified  and  prioritized  the\nimprovement  of  multimodal  transport  infrastructure.  During  the  2000  Country  Programming\nMission,  the  Government  requested  ADB  assistance  to  develop  the  corridor  in  West  Bengal.\nProject preparation work on the highest priority components of the corridor was carried out under\nthree ADB small-scale TAs.2 In April 2001, the ADB Fact-Finding Mission3 formulated the Project\non the basis of discussions with the Government, other agencies active in the road sector, and the\nproject  preparation  reports.  The  Appraisal  Mission  completed  the  review  of  all  aspects  of  the\nProject and the sector in July 2001. Loan negotiations with Government representatives were held\nin Manila from 12 to 14 November 2001. The project framework is in Appendix 1.\n\nIII. \n\nBACKGROUND\n\nA.\n\nSector Description\n\n1. \n\nWest Bengal Corridor\n\na.\n\nTransport System\n\n3.\nThe  West  Bengal  corridor  extends  from  Haldia  port  via  Kolkata  to  the  northern  parts  of\nWest Bengal. In  the Shiliguri area, the transport network divides into routes westward to Nepal,\nDarjiling (in West Bengal), and Sikkim; and eastward to Bhutan, and Assam, to the other north-\neastern states of India, namely, Arunchal Pradesh, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, and\nTripura. The corridor also has links with Bangladesh; Nepal-Bangladesh and Bhutan-Bangladesh\ntraffic crosses the east-west routes. The West Bengal corridor can be divided into two distinct but\nrelated sections: namely, (i) Kolkata-Shiliguri, and (ii) Haldia-Kolkata. National Highway (NH) 34 is\nthe  main  road  transport  link,  connecting  the  outskirts  of  Kolkata  to  Dalkhola  at  the  intersection\nwith NH 31, some 453 kilometers (km) north of Kolkata. NH 31 in turn leads to Shiliguri. NH 34\nparallels the east bank of the Hugli river (the lowest reach of the River Ganga), passes through\nKrishnanagar  and  Baharampur,  and  crosses  the  River  Ganga  at  the  Farakka  Barrage.  From\nFarakka,  the  road  continues  via  Maldah  and  Raiganj  to  Dalkhola.  Both  NH  34  and  NH  31  are\n\n                  \n\n1998.\n\n1 TA 3142-IND: North-South Corridor Development Project in West Bengal, for $1.0 million, approved on 23 December\n\n2 TA 3538-IND: Preliminary Engineering for the West Bengal Corridor Development Project, for $150,000, approved on\n13  November  2000;  TA  3539-IND:  Resettlement and Environmental Assessment for the West Bengal Corridor\nDevelopment Project, for $150,000, approved on 13 November 2000; TA 3540-IND: Economic and Poverty Analysis\nfor the West Bengal Corridor Development Project, for $150,000, approved on 13 November 2000.\n\n3 The  project  processing  team  comprised  T.  Kandiah,  Senior  Investment/Programs  Officer,  India  Resident  Mission\n(INRM)  and  Mission  Leader;  P.  Vallely,  Transport  Specialist;  A.  Goswami,  Counsel;  R.  Jayewardene,  Social\nDevelopment Specialist; Yue-Lang Feng, Environment Specialist; and H. Mukhopadhyay, Macroeconomist (INRM).\n\n\f2\n\npredominantly  two-lane  with  unpaved  shoulders  and  are  heavily  congested  with  frequent\naccidents  and  delays.  Pedestrians,  animal  carts,  and  two-  and  three-wheeled  traffic  occupy  the\nmain carriageway rather than using the unpaved shoulders; bypasses of towns and villages are\nrare. Sections of NH 34 are subject to closure for long periods due to flooding in the rainy season.\nBetween Haldia and Kolkata, a distance of 62 km, three modes of transport are available: road,\nrail, and inland waterway. The main road link from Haldia to Kolkata is indirect, via the two-lane\nNH 41 between Haldia and Kolaghat, and then by NH 6, also two-lane, to the junction of the Kona\nExpressway, a distance of about 120 km.\n\n4.\nTA 3142 (footnote 1) identified a number of high priority multimodal transport infrastructure\nimprovements to be implemented in a phased manner over a 5- to 10-year time frame (Appendix\n2).  The  infrastructure  improvements  are  proposed  for  financing  using  a  mixture  of  public  funds\nand  public-private  partnerships.  The  most  critical  components  of  the  transport  system  in  the\ncorridor identified are the improvement and partial rehabilitation of NH 34, and the construction of\nconnectors  linking  Haldia  to  Kolkata  and  the  national  highway  network.  The  improvement  and\npartial  rehabilitation  of  NH  34  was  proposed  as  the  component  requiring  immediate  attention\nbecause  of  its  (i)  strategic  importance  as  the  spine  of  the  transport  system,  (ii)  high  social  and\neconomic  development  impact,  (iii)  preparedness  for  implementation  with  relatively  minor  land\nacquisition and resettlement impacts, and (iv) unsuitability for private financing. Detailed feasibility\nstudies on the connectors between Haldia and Kolkata (which will be on new alignments) and the\nnational highway network, are ongoing with funding from the National Highways Authority of India\n(NHAI). Once these studies are completed, the need for ADB financing will be examined, together\nwith  financing  from  other  development  agencies  active  in  the  road  sector  in  India  and  private\nparticipation.\n\nb. \n\nEconomic Centers in the Corridor\n\n5.\nHaldia. A major port, Haldia has an existing industrial base that has accompanied the port\ndevelopment  since  the  late  1980s.  Haldia  is  rapidly  growing  into  one  of  the  major  industrial\ncenters  of  eastern  India,  with  an  expanding  manufacturing  base  and  an  oil  refinery.  Production\nfrom  a  large,  recently  commissioned,  petrochemical  plant  will  generate  many  downstream\nindustries, which will be located in Haldia or elsewhere in West Bengal. Haldia port handles about\n14 million tons of imports and 7 million tons of exports.\n\n6.\nBetween Haldia and Kolkata. Incentives include duty-free imports of machinery and raw\nmaterials, exemptions from excise duty, reimbursement of sales tax, private bonded warehousing,\nsimplified  customs  procedures,  and  concessional  lease  rents.  The  GWB  has  provided  the\nindustrial and social infrastucture for an export processing zone, about 55 km south of Kolkata.\n\n7.\nKolkata. A river port, Kolkata is one of the major industrial and trading cities of India. The\nCalcutta Metropolitan Area dominates the industrial scene of the state of West Bengal. The main\nindustries  are  casting  and  forging  iron  and  steel,  copper,  brass,  aluminium,  zinc,  fertilizers,\npesticides, manufacture of paper and paper products, and basic and heavy inorganic chemicals.\nThe  industrial  pattern  is  dominated  by  steel-  and  coal-based  industries;  jute  mills  and  cotton\ntextiles are also major industries. The Calcutta Metropolitan authority is proposing to create a light\nindustries  township  over  405  hectres  (ha)  in  the  Salt  Lake-Rajarhat  belt  (north  of  Kolkata)  with\nprivate participation.\n\n\f3\n\nKolkata to Shiliguri. A distance of about 550 km, this area is largely rural with agriculture\n8.\nand  agroprocessing  the  main  economic  activities,  apart  from  the  Kalyani  industrial  area  located\n55  km  north  of  Kolkata.  Agricultural  productivity  in  West  Bengal  has  increased  substantially.  To\nsustain  this  growth,  a  continuous  supply  of  material  inputs  especially  from  urban  centers  to  the\nrural  areas  is  essential;  as  is  a  transport  linkage  between  rural  and  urban  areas,  and  between\nfarm  and  consumer  or  processing  plants  for  production  and  distribution  of  agricultural  products.\nThe  movement  of  this  traffic  along  the  north-south  axis  of  West  Bengal  must  be  maintained  to\nenable continuing economic growth. Barasat is known for its manufacturing plants for edible oils,\nweaving  of  cotton  textiles,  and  spinning  and  weaving  of  jute-related  products.  Maldah  district\nproduces rice, jute, wheat, and fruit; while Dinajpur district produces rice; jute; maize; rape seed;\nmustard; sugarcane; and temperate crops such as pulses, tobacco, chillies, and vegetables.\n\nShiliguri. Located in Darjiling district, Shiliguri is the main trade and commercial center of\n9.\nthe north of West Bengal. Tea from Darjiling, Dooars, and Assam; crude oil from the Assamese oil\nfields  to  various  refineries;  fruits  and  flowers  grown  in  Darjiling  district;  tourist  traffic  to  Sikkim,\nBhutan,  and  the  northeast  are  all  routed  through  Shiliguri.  Industries  include  a  plant\nmanufacturing distilled fatty-acid glycerol. Food processing, leather, paper, dairy, tea, horticulture,\nand floriculture could be developed.\n\n10.\nThe  economic  potential  of  the  corridor  should  be  developed  fully  so  that  the  corridor\nbecomes an area of economic activity, which will create jobs and help reduce poverty, instead of\nmerely serving as a transport corridor connecting the landlocked northeastern states of India and\nthe  neighboring  countries  to  the  ports  in  the  Bay  of  Bengal.  The  development  of  an  economic\ncorridor requires a holistic approach to planning, cutting across many sectors and involving a wide\nrange of stakeholders. A framework for the economic corridor is being developed to (i) define the\ngeographic  coverage  of  the  corridor;  (ii)  identify  priority  projects,  policies,  and  institutions;  (iii)\nquantify  the  resources  required  and  sources  of  financing;  and,  (iv)  clarify  the  roles  of  the  public\nand private sectors in corridor development.\n\n2.\n\nSubregional Cooperation\n\n11.\nADB\u2019s  support  for  subregional  cooperation  in  eastern  South  Asia  has  focused  mainly  on\ncooperation  between  Bangladesh,  Bhutan,  India  (especially  east  and  northeastern  India),  and\nNepal. The subregion is home to about half a billion people and is among the poorest regions in\nthe  world.  Nonetheless,  the  subregion  offers  a  large  hardworking  workforce  at  relatively  low\nwages.  With  suitable  investment  to  develop  skills,  this  workforce  could  provide  a  major\ncompetitive  advantage.  In  December  1996,  the  four  countries  launched  the  South  Asia  Growth\nQuadrangle, which the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation subsequently endorsed\nas a subregional initiative. The South Asia Growth Quadrangle countries have selected Nepal as\nthe  coordinating  country  and  assigned  the  following  sector  responsibilities:  Bangladesh  for\nenergy;  Bhutan  for  environment;  India  for  trade  and  investment,  and  Nepal  for  transport  and\ntourism.  In  addition  to  the  official  (Track  I)  activities,  non-official  (Track  II)  initiatives  are  being\nundertaken to promote subregional cooperation.\n\nIn  November  2000,  under  an  ADB  small-scale  regional  TA,4  the  first  meeting  of  the\n12.\nPrivate Sector Forum on Economic Cooperation in the Eastern South Asia Subregion5 was held\n\n                  \n\n4 TA  5890-REG:  First Meeting of the Private Sector Forum on Economic Cooperation in the Eastern South Asia\n\nSubregion, for $30,000, approved on 23 December 1999.\n\n5  Consisting  of  Bangladesh,  Bhutan,  Nepal,  and  the  Indian  states  of,  Arunachal  Pradesh,  Assam,  Bihar,  Manipur,\n\nMeghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, Sikkim, Tripura, and West Bengal.\n\n\f4\n\nin  Kolkata  as  a  Track  II  initiative.  The  meeting  provided  a  forum  for  officials  representing\ngovernment,  and  chambers  of  commerce  and  industry  from  the  four  countries,  and  the  private\nsector  to  explore  opportunities  for  cooperation  in  energy,  transport,  tourism,  and  trade  and\ninvestment. An investment program for the subregion would include an economic corridor around\nthe Bay of Bengal, linking the ports of Chittagong, Dhaka, Haldia, Kolkata, and Mongla. It would\nalso include a transport grid of highways, rail and inland waterways linking Bhutan, Nepal, and the\nnortheastern  states  of  India  to  the  ports  in  the  Bay  of  Bengal  through  Bangladesh  and  West\nBengal.  Similar  grids  could  be  developed  for  power,  hydrocarbons  and  telecommunications.  In\nSeptember  2000,  ADB  provided  TA6  to  assist  Bangladesh,  Bhutan,  India,  and  Nepal  to  identify\npotential  subregional  programs  and  projects  that  have  cross-border  benefits,  and  address  key\ncross-border coordination issues that may arise at the project level. The main sectors covered by\nthe TA include (i) energy and power, (ii) environment, (iii) trade investment and the private sector,\n(iv)  transportation,  and  (v)  tourism.  The  ongoing  activities  include  identifying  both  physical\ninvestments and nonphysical barriers to creating an enabling environment for trade.\n\n13.\nThe  project  corridor  is  an  important  subregional  artery  because  West  Bengal  borders\nBangladesh to the east; Nepal to the northwest; Bhutan to the northeast; and the states of Bihar,\nJharkand, and Orissa to the west; Sikkim to the north; and Assam to the east. Traffic from India\u2019s\nnortheastern states must pass through West Bengal to reach an Indian port. The existing NH 31C\nconnects Shiliguri with Banitanki at the Nepal border and with Phuntsholing in Bhutan. Fourteen\nland-border  crossing  points  have  been  designated  between  West  Bengal  and  Bangladesh,  nine\nfor road, three for rail, and two for inland waterways. Most of the road crossings are at Petrapole-\nBenapole near Bangaon and at Hilli. State highways (SH 1 and SH 10) connect Bangaon and Hilli\nto the project corridor.\n\n14.\nImprovements  to  transport  infrastructure  with  subregional  cooperation  implications  must\nbe  accompanied  with  measures  to  reduce  or  remove  the  nonphysical  barriers  to  the  efficient\nmovement of goods and people. This includes measures such as allowing freight trucks access\nacross  borders,  streamlining  cross-border  inspection  procedures  and  working  hours,  and\nsimplifying  documentation  requirements.  A  bilateral  agreement  for  a  direct  Kolkata-Dhaka  bus\nservice  has  been  implemented  with  two  return  services  operating  daily  through  Petropole.  The\nrailway  route  to  Bangladesh  through  Petropole  reopened  to  freight  traffic  in  January  2001.  The\nissue  of  facilitating  the  movement  of  goods  and  people  across  borders  through  bilateral\nagreements and a framework agreement for all four eastern South Asian countries (Bangladesh,\nBhutan,  India,  and  Nepal)  is  being  addressed  by  the  Transport  Group  under  the  ADB  TA  5936\n(footnote 6), which had its first meeting in Kathmandu in October 2001. The participating countries\nidentified  various  institutional/procedural  reform  projects  such  as  (i)  a  review  of  existing\nnonphysical barriers to the movement of goods and people across borders; (ii) development of an\naction plan to prepare bilateral and quadilateral framework agreements; and (iii) standardization\nof  road  safety,  traffic  and  transport  regulations  in  the  subregion.  These  initiatives  will  be\naddressed during the second phase of the TA, which is currently being processed.\n\na.\n\nRoad Network and Administration in West Bengal\n\nRoad transport is the dominant mode of transport in the state of West Bengal. The state\n15.\nhas a primary network of about 17,623 km of roads consisting of 1,966 km of national highways\n(10 percent of the network length), 3,388 km of state highways (20 percent), 5,833 km of major\ndistrict roads (33 percent), and 6,436 km of other district roads (37 percent). About 95 percent of\n\n6  TA  5936-REG:  Identification and Prioritization of Subregional Projects in South Asia,  for  $785,000,  approved  on\n\n                  \n\n2000.\n\n\f5\n\nthe  primary  network  is  paved.  The  state  also  has  a  village  and  urban  road  network  of  about\n35,600  km,  but  only  about  47  percent  of  the  villages  in  the  state  (of  38,000  villages)  are\nconnected  by  roads.  In  the  past,  the  state  invested  more  heavily  on  extending  the  rural  road\nnetwork (major and other district roads) than the state highways, resulting in the length of major\nand  other  district  roads  growing  at  almost  twice  the  pace  of  state  highways.  Almost  all  of  the\nprimary network was constructed before the 1980s. The network has been extended marginally,\nby less than 400 km, since 1981.\n\nIn  contrast,  demand  for  road  transport  has  been  increasing  rapidly  at  an  annual  rate  of\n16.\nabout  11  percent  since  the  early  1980s,  largely  outpacing  the  capacity  expansion  of  the  road\nnetwork  in  the  state.  In  addition,  most  of  the  primary  network  comprises  single-lane  (about  45\npercent)  or  intermediate-lane  (about  45  percent)  roads  with  limited  capacity  and  poor  riding\nquality. The mismatch of demand and supply of road transport has resulted in road infrastructure\nbecoming one of the key constraints to the social and economic development of the state.\n\n17.\nThe capacity constraint of the road network has been exacerbated by inadequate attention\nto, and funding for, network maintenance, which has in turn hastened the deterioration of the state\nroad system. Funding for road maintenance has been less than 50 percent of the requirement as\nper  Finance  Commission-recommended  norms  in  the  last  decade.  The  funding  gap  for\nmaintenance  needs  to  be  progressively  reduced  and  an  effective  road  management  system\ndeveloped to maintain the existing road assets.\n\n18.\nThe  primary  road  network  is  administered  by  the  West  Bengal  Public  Works  (Roads)\nDepartment (WBPWRD), which oversees planning, design, construction, and maintenance of all\nstate  roads,  bridges,  and  buildings,  as  well  as  the  construction  and  maintenance  of  national\nhighways on behalf of the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways (MORTH). Since its creation,\nWBPWRD has enjoyed a monopoly for the providing engineering, construction supervision, and\nmaintenance services.\n\nb.\n\nRoad Transport Industry in West Bengal\n\n19.\nThe  trucking  industry  carries  over  70  percent  of  the  total  freight  traffic.  The  industry  is\ndominated  by  small  operators:  77  percent  own  a  small  fleet  of  up  to  5  trucks;  the  majority  own\nonly  one  truck.  They  are  primarily  engaged  in  the  haulage  of  freight  and  are  dependent  on\nbrokers  and  booking  agents  for  business.  Only  about  6  percent  of  the  trucks  are  owned  by\ncompanies with a fleet of 20 or more. Due to the fragmented nature of the industry, system output\nhas suffered for lack of economies of scale.\n\n20.\nEntry into and exit from the trucking industry is easy; no registration scheme is in place for\ntransport  operators.  Large  transport  companies  are  registered  under  the  Partnership  Act  or  the\nCompanies  Act.  The  Motor  Vehicle  Act  1988,  only  mandates  owners  to  register  vehicles  and\nobtain a permit for their operations. Permits are liberally issued, almost on request.\n\n21.\nThe freight rate structure for road transport is determined at different levels. The transport\ncontractors or the booking agent quote and settle freight rates with the consignors. These rates\nare negotiated and are valid for a given time period. The truck owners depend on brokers, who\nhave  day-to-day  arrangements  with  them,  for  obtaining  goods  to  be  transported.  The  brokers\narrange  the  goods  for  the  truck  owners  from  the  booking  agents  at  the  prevailing  market  rates;\nand charge a brokerage fee, which ranges from Rs200 to Rs400 per vehicle trip.\n\n\f6\n\nPublic  transport  is  undertaken  by  state  transport  corporations  (STCs)  and  private\n22.\noperators.  West  Bengal  has  five  STCs:,  (i)  North  Bengal  STC,  (ii)  South  Bengal  STC,  (iii)  West\nBengal STC, (iv) Calcutta STC, and (v) Calcutta Tramways Company. In 2001, the STCs owned\nwas  approximately  2,800  buses,  approximately  12  percent  of  the  total  West  Bengal  bus  fleet  of\n23,000.  Private  bus  companies  have  their  own  operators  associations  and  bus  workers  unions.\nEntry into public transport operations for private companies or individuals consists of applying for\na  route  license  to  either  the  regional  transport  authority  of  the  district  where  operation  is\nrequested or to the State Transport Authority if operation is to cover several districts and regions.\nThe  tariff  structure  of  public  transport  services  is  fixed  by  the  state,  i.e,  the  State  Transport\nAuthority,  which  reviews  the  fare  structure  from  time  to  time,  and  make  adjustments  as\nnecessary. Operators on the same route charge the same fare.\n\nB.\n\nGovernment Policies and Plans\n\n23.\nThe  Government\u2019s  strategy  for  the  road  sector  under  its  Ninth  Five-Year  Plan\n(FY1997/2002) is to improve the quality of the national highway network to provide safe, efficient,\nand economic carriage of goods and people. The road network also needs to be expanded and\nstrengthened to improve accessibility of the hinterland, especially the rural areas, and to facilitate\nthe  integration  of  isolated  parts  of  the  country.  In  December  1998,  the  Government  announced\nthe  National  Highway  Development  Program  as  a  national  priority,  which  includes  the\nquadrilateral  corridors  connecting  Chennai,  Delhi,  Kolkata,  and  Mumbai,  as  well  as  north-south\nand east-west national corridors.\n\n24.\nGWB  has  given  high  priority  to  transport  development  in  the  state  and  particularly  the\nnorth-south  corridor  in  West  Bengal.  In  March  1999,  the  GWB  set  up  the  Task  Force  on\nInfrastructure with Special Emphasis on Roads under the Commerce and Industries Department.\nThe  state's  priorities  for  roads  during  the  ninth  and  tenth  plan  periods  (1997/2007)  are  to  (i)\nreplace  level  crossings  on  heavily  utilized  railways;  (ii)  construct  bypasses  of  all  district\ntraffic;  (iv)\nheadquarters;  (iii)  rehabilitate  half  of \nwiden/strengthen half of the state highways as required; (v) construct all missing links in the state\nhighway network; (vi) construct expressways from major industrial centrers/ports to Kolkata; and\n(vii)  maintain  all-weather  connections  to  all  villages  with  populations  over  1,000  and  half  of  the\nvillages with population of 500-1,000.\n\nthe  weak/narrow  bridges  with  heavy \n\nC.\n\nExternal Assistance to the Sector\n\nSince 1988, ADB has extended five loans7 totaling $1,113 million, one TA loan8 for $12.7\n25.\nmillion,  and  20  TAs  totalling  $7.925  million  to  India\u2019s  road  sector.  Apart  from  ADB,  the  World\nBank  and  the  Japan  Bank  for  International  Cooperation  (JBIC)9  are  also  involved  in  the  road\nsector.  The  World  Bank  has  provided  financing  for  nine  projects  amounting  to  about  $1,900\nmillion  to  construct  and  rehabilitate  rural  roads,  improve  state  highways,  and  widen  national\nhighways  to  four  lanes.  JBIC  has  provided  five  loans  amounting  to  $263  million  equivalent  to\n\n                  \n\n7  Loan  0918-IND:  Road Improvement Project, for  $198  million,  approved  on  10  November  1988.  Loan  1041-IND:\nSecond Road Project, for $250 million, approved on 30 October 1990. Loan 1274-IND: National Highways Project, for\n$245  million,  approved  on  29  November  1993.  Loan  1747-IND:  Surat-Manor Tollway Project,  for  $180  million,\napproved  on  27  July  2000.  Loan  1839-IND: Western Transport Corridor Project,  for  $240  million,  approved  on  20\nSeptember 2001.\n\n8 Loan  1279-IND:  Bombay-Vadodara Expressway Technical Assistance Project,  for  $12.7  million,  approved  on  2\n\nDecember 1993.\n\n9  The work was initially supported by the Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund of Japan, which was merged with the\n\nJapan Export-Import Bank on 1 October 1999 to form JBIC.\n\n\f7\n\nupgrade  NH  2  and  NH  5  to  four  lanes,  and  to  construct  a  bridge  across  the  Yamuna  River  at\nAllahabad-Naini. ADB\u2019s assistance to the road sector is well coordinated with the World Bank and\nJBIC through regular consultations. A coordinated assistance strategy for the road sector in India\nis being prepared in consultation with the Government, World Bank, and other financing agencies.\nDetails of external assistance to the road sector in India are given in Appendix 3.\n\nD.\n\nLessons Learned\n\nADB\u2019s  second  loan  project,  Loan  1041-IND  (footnote  7)  included  a  component  to\n26.\nstrengthen  and  widen  about  150  km  of  the  state  highway  from  Panagarh  to  Moregram  in  West\nBengal. The project experienced long delays. Preconstruction activities relating to the recruitment\nof supervision consultants and the procurement of civil works were delayed. Further delays were\nexperienced  during  construction  because  of  (i)  inadequacy  in  the  original  survey,  design,  and\ndrawings; (ii) delayed land acquisition, clearance of trees and utilities resulting in nonavailability of\ncontinuous unencumbered sites for the contractor\u2019s use; (iii) poor contract management, and (iv)\nunusual weather conditions. The project was completed in December 1999. ADB\u2019s third project,\nLoan  1274-IND  (footnote  7),  included  the  improvement  of  about  42  km  of  national  highway  in\nWest Bengal between Panagarh and Raniganj. The third project also experienced start-up delays.\nThe  award  of  civil  works  contracts  was  delayed  because  of  litigation  by  some  unsuccessful\nbidders.  When  the  contracts  were  eventually  awarded,  the  project  sites  were  not  cleared  of\nutilities  and  trees  for  the  contractors  to  commence  work  immediately.  After  these  initial  delays,\nconstruction work is now progressing well with completion expected in December 2001.\n\n27.\nCareful attention has been paid to overcoming the shortcomings of previous ADB projects\nin  the  road  sector  by  developing  the  following  project  implementation  arrangements:  (i)  start-up\ndelays  will  be  reduced  by  approving  advance  action  for  the  procurement  of  the  civil  works\ncontracts and the recruitment of supervision consultants; (ii) land acquisition and the clearance of\ntrees and utilities from the right-of way will be a condition for contract award; (iii) ambiguities in the\ntender documents, which led to court actions under ADB\u2019s third project, will be removed through\nthe mandatory use of ADB\u2019s standard bidding documents; and (iv) the prequalification criteria will\nbe  tightened,  and  the  contract  package  size  made  large  enough  to  attract  experienced\ncontractors.\n\nE. \n\nADB\u2019s Sector Strategy\n\n28.\nADB\u2019s  sector  strategy  is  to  reduce  road  infrastructure  bottlenecks  on  the  key  transport\ncorridors  to  support  India\u2019s  efforts  to  achieve  higher  sustainable  economic  growth.  ADB\u2019s\napproach is to promote efficiency in the delivery and maintenance of road infrastructure through\nappropriate  policy  measures  and  maximizing,  where  feasible,  private  participation.  Within  this\nstrategy, ADB involvement in the road sector will focus on projects that have significant direct and\nindirect  impacts  on  poverty  reduction,  facilitate  subregional  economic  cooperation,  and  promote\nprivate  sector  development.  The  sector  strategy  supports  ADB\u2019s  operational  strategy  for  India.\nADB\u2019s current assistance for the Government\u2019s National Highway Development Plan focuses on\nthe  western  transport  corridor,  comprising  NH  8  (Delhi-Jaipur-Ahmedabad-Mumbai)  and  NH  4\n(Mumbai-Bangalore-Chennai).  The  other  five  major  road  transport  corridors  (Delhi-Kolkata,\nMumbai-Nagpur-Kolkata,  Delhi-Nagpur-Bangalore,  Kolkata-Chennai,  and  Chennai-Madurai)  are\nbeing  developed  with  assistance  from  the  World  Bank  and  JBIC.  The  next  phase  of  ADB\u2019s\nassistance for the national plan will be determined in consultation with the Government and the\nother  major  development  agencies.  Given  the  potentially  large  funding  requirements  over  the\nmedium  to  long  term,  ADB  has  adopted  a  programmatic  approach  under  which  investment\n\n\f8\n\nprojects  will  have  accompanying  policy  components  to  improve  the  road  sector  policy\nenvironment in a coherent, progressive and sequential manner.\n\nF.\n\nPolicy Dialogue\n\n29.\nSince  1988,  ADB  has  conducted  policy  dialogue  with  the  Government  on  various  major\nroad sector issues. ADB\u2019s involvement in the road sector has resulted in (i) increased attention to\nroad maintenance; (ii) improved design, construction, and contract management standards, now\nat  international  practice  levels;  (iii)  improved  road  safety  and  environmental  impact  awareness;\n(iv)  establishment  of  NHAI  as  a  single  autonomous  agency  responsible  for  the  development,\nmaintenance,  and  management  of  the  national  highway  and  expressway  network;  and  (v)\ninitiatives  to  increase  private  participation.  While  significant  policy  and  institutional  progress  has\nbeen made, ADB is continuing its dialogue with MORTH and NHAI on national road sector issues\nsuch as (i) establishment of a medium- to long-term vision for NHAI, (ii) improved efficiency and\neffectiveness of highway maintenance, and (iii) road safety.\n\nDuring project processing, a corridor and sector development framework was developed in\n30.\nconsultation  with  GWB  to  improve  the  policy  environment  for  the  efficient  delivery  of  transport\ninfrastructure in West Bengal. A description of the main elements of the policy framework follows.\n\n1. \n\nWBPWRD Organizational and Financial Reform\n\n31.\nThe  general  condition  of  roads  in  West  Bengal  is  not  satisfactory  and  per  capita  road\nlength  is  much  below  the  country  average.  The  vehicle  population  in  the  state  has  been\nincreasing  at  an  average  of  11  percent  over  the  last  few  years;  the  rate  of  traffic  growth  is\nexpected to rise along with increasing industrialization and development activities in the coming\nyears. Therefore widening, strengthening, and upgrading of the road network, which is suffering\nfrom  capacity  and  strength  constraints,  have  become  urgently  necessary.  GWB  will  require  a\nmodern,  effective,  and  efficient  institutional  and  financial  structure  to  successfully  manage  the\nstate\u2019s road network and road infrastructure.\n\n32. With  assistance  from  the  World  Bank\u2019s  TA  loan  facility,  GWB  is    reviewing  the  state\u2019s\ncurrent  institutional  and  financial  structures  to  develop  an  institutional  development  strategy  for\nWBPWRD.  The  objective  of  the  institutional  review  is  to  establish  a  strategy  for  sustainable\nimprovement of West Bengal\u2019s institutional framework, which will enlarge and improve the state\u2019s\ntechnical  and  financing  capacity  to  effectively  and  efficiently  manage  the  West  Bengal  road\ntransport  network  and  related  infrastructure,  and  also  meet  the  transport  demands  of  its  users.\nThe institutional development strategy will enable GWB to\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\npromote  a  more  rational  and  efficient  approach  to  road  investment  planning,\nmaintenance, and funding at the state level;\n\nimprove the institutional capacity in the sector through a comprehensive revision of\nthe  focus,  organization,  technical  skills,  and  resourcing  of  the  main  GWB  road\ndevelopment and maintenance bodies;\n\n(iii) \n\nimprove  resource  mobilization  in  the  sector  through  state  and  user\u2019s  funding  to\nensure the sustainability of the state highway and major district road network;\n\n\f(iv) \n\n(v)\n\n(i)\n\n(ii)\n\n(iii)\n\n(iv)\n\n(v)\n\n9\n\nupgrade the capacity of the private engineering and construction industry to meet\ngrowing  demand  for  high-quality  highway  engineering  and  construction  services;\nand\n\nimprove  the  riding  quality  and  capacity  of  selected  congested  segments  of  state\nhighways  and  major  district  roads  to  reduce  vehicle  operating  costs,  travel  time,\naccidents, and pollution.\n\nThe  study  will  assess  all  relevant  aspects  of  the  state\u2019s  road  infrastructure  and  develop\n33.\nstrategies  encompassing  the  specific  aims,  measures,  and  interventions  needed  to  achieve  the\nmedium-  to  long-term,  institutional,  technical,  human  resources,  and  financial  enhancements  in\nthe GWB road transport infrastructure framework. The study will also consider the existing legal\nand  policy  frameworks,  and  propose  changes  that  can  be  made  within  these  frameworks,  or\nidentify  realistic  amendments  than  can  be  made  to  these  frameworks  to  provide  an  enabling\nenvironment  for  the  proposed  changes.  The  final  institutional  development  strategy  report  will\ninclude the necessary transitional strategy(ies),including\n\ndevelopment  of  specific  action  plans \ninstitutional structure(s) and responsibilities for road transport;\n\nfor  any \n\ntransformation(s)  of  GWB\u2019s\n\ndetailed financial and strategic planning for initiating new financing and/or revenue\ncollection mechanisms for West Bengal road network funding needs;\n\npreimplementation  planning  for  the  organizational,  administrative,  and  financial\naspects of any proposed new structure(s);\n\nidentification  of  needs  for  enhanced/new  systems,  processes,  technologies,  and\nresources,  particularly  in  relation  to  financial  management  and  accounting,\ninformation technology/system, procurement and contract administration, technical\nplanning, quality assurance, and project management; and\n\nassistance  with  implementing  new  approaches,  systems,  and  process;  and\nintroducing  appropriate  long-term  training  programs  for  the  organization(s)  and\nstaff concerned.\n\n2.\n\nRoad Financing\n\n34.\nFunds  are  allocated  for  specific  road  works  in  the  following  manner:  (i)  cyclically\ndetermined  five-year  state  plan  allocations  for  new  works  with  annual  allocations  for  specific\nprojects, (ii) annual recurrent or nonplan budget allocations for maintenance and administration of\nexisting  infrastructure,  and  (iii)  central  plan  allocations  for  selected  capital  expenditures  from\ncentral  revenues.  Some  additional  revenues  derive  from  state  levies  on  fuels,  licensing,  and\nvarious other user aspects of activities for West Bengal road transport. However, these revenues\ntypically accrue to the state\u2019s general revenue rather than for direct application to road needs. The\ncombination of the central plan allocations and plan provisions from the state\u2019s budget has helped\nthe development of a vast road network in the state. This has increased expectations, and liability\nfor  road  maintenance  requirements,  which  by  and  large,  have  been  underfunded  due  to\ncompeting demands on resources from other sectors.\n\n\f10\n\nAs  a  result  of  this  funding  shortfall,  the  state\u2019s  road  assets  markedly  deteriorated.\n35.\nUnusually  heavy  traffic  growth  and  increased  maintenance  requirements  are  the  major  factors\ncontributing  to  the  greatly  increased  need  for  road  investment  in  West  Bengal.  Any  move  to\nsignificantly increase GWB funding allocations from its own resources for the state\u2019s road network\nwould not be possible owing to other competing demands for development for other sectors in the\noverall  GWB  budget  funding  context.  Accordingly,  the  growing  financial  needs  for  both  proper\nongoing  maintenance  and  new  investments  in  West  Bengal  road  infrastructure  require  new\nsources of such finance to be developed, with appropriate institutional measures.\n\n36.\nThe  Central  Road  Fund  Ordinance  2000  provides  statutory  effect  to  the  nonlapsable\nCentral  Road  Fund.  The  fund\u2019s  revenue  is  earmarked  for  specific  transport  uses.  Proceeds  are\nallocated to each state in proportion to its fuel consumption (60 percent) and area (40 percent).\nThe fund is financed primarily by a Re1 per liter tax on petrol and high-speed diesel fuel, which\nhave  been  levied  since  June  1998  and  March  1999  respectively.  About  Rs60  billion  was\ngenerated from this source up to 31 March 2000. The petrol tax and Re0.5 of the diesel tax is to\nbe  applied  on  the  following  basis:  57.5  percent  for  the  National  Highway  Development  Project\nbeing  undertaken  by  NHAI,  27  percent  for  state  highways,  3  percent  for  roads  of  interstate  and\neconomic importance, and 12.5 percent for railway overpasses. Re0.5 of the diesel assessment is\nfor  use  in  the  rural  connectivity  program.  Other  potential  revenue  sources  for  the  road  fund\ninclude  service  taxes  on  road  transport,  user  fees  for  overpasses  and  registration  and  license\nfees.\n\n37.\nAt  the  state  level,  Andhra  Pradesh,  Tamil  Nadu,  and  Uttar  Pradesh  have  made\nconsiderable progress in moving toward setting up state road funds. The broad guiding principle\nof the state road fund is that it should be dedicated, sustainable, and professionally managed with\na proper legal framework. The objectives of the state road fund will be to\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nbridge  the  resource  gap,  and  accelerate  improvement  and  maintenance  of  state\nroads;\n\ninfluence  investments  in  the  road  sector  through  long-term  plans  and  annual\nprograms;\n\n(iii) \n\nleverage fund availability in conjunction with the private sector;\n\n(iv) \n\nprovide  funds  for  project  development  activities,  including  projects  for  multilateral\nand private financing; and\n\n(v) \n\nfund institutional capacity building, including training.\n\nThe  potential  revenue  sources  for  the  state  road  fund  will  be  transfers  from  the  Central\n38.\nRoad Fund; additional levy of Re1.00 per liter on petrol and Re0.50 per liter on diesel, sales tax\non fuel, and vehicle road tax. The state road fund should (i) be managed by an autonomous board\nwith  representation  of  all  stakeholders  (government,  automobile  associations,  bus  and  truck\noperators, financial institutions, chambers of commerce, and nongovernment organizations); and\n(ii) include a public consultation process and independent audit arrangements.\n\n\f11\n\nTo improve the current road financing position, GWB needs to prepare a comprehensive,\n39.\nfully integrated road infrastructure development strategy that will take into account consultations\non the needs and priorities of the sector with all the major groups and organizations involved in\nthe  road  sector,  and  will  include  a  viable  action  plan  for  immediate  and  continuing  measures  to\nimprove maintenance of the state road network, and a road financing master plan that will include\noptions for increased financing, including a state road fund.\n\n3.\n\nCorridor Management and Transport Development in West Bengal\n\n40.\nGWB  established  the  North-South  Economic  Corridor  Board  through  a  Government\nresolution  in  April  2000.    The  Project  Board  has  the  Chief  Secretary  of  GWB  as  Chair,  and\nrepresentation from various relevant departments (such as home, finance, transport, public works,\nland, commerce and industry, and power as members). The board also has representation from\nWest  Bengal  Industrial  Development  Corporation;  IWIN  (a  joint  venture  between  WBIDC  and\nICICI);  Calcutta  Port  Trust;  NHAI  and  MORTH.  The  board,  however,  does  not  have  a  clearly\ndocumented mandate and constitution, and all its members including the member convenor (who\nis also the project director) are part-time members who have full-time responsibilities in their own\ndepartments  or  organizations.  While  the  seniority  of  the  members  of  the  board  clearly  makes  it\nappropriate  for  taking  policy  decisions,  it  is  not  suitable  for  involving  itself  in  coordination  or\noperational  matters.  In  addition,  the  Board\u2019s  scope  needs  to  be  extended  to  include  all  land\ntransport matters in West Bengal. The development of transport infrastructure in the West Bengal\nCorridor and across West Bengal requires multisectoral consultation and coordination.\n\n41.\nThe North-South Economic Corridor Board needs to be reconstituted, to clearly identify its\nrole and responsibilities, and to expand its coverage to all land transport development. The salient\nfeatures of the proposed reconstituted board or standing committee include the following:\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nThe  board  or  standing  committee  will  comprise  the  chief  secretary  as  chair,  and\nrepresentatives of the road and rail transport authorities, finance, commerce, and\nindustry departments; and should meet quarterly.\n\nAn  executive  committee  or  secretariat,  to  be  constituted  within  an  existing\ndepartment  to  be  responsible  for  implementing  the  board  or  standing  committee\nresolutions,  will  translate  the  policies  into  specific  project  strategies  or  project\ncomponent  strategies  relating  to  the  development  of  transport  infrastructure  in\nWest Bengal in general and the West Bengal Corridor in particular.\n\nProject  implementation  will  be  the  responsibility  of  either  the  private  sector  or\nWBPWD through private contractors if the project component is publicly funded.\n\nThe board or standing committee will get specialist advice on all matters relating to\nprivate participation.\n\n4.\n\nPrivate Sector Development\n\n42.\nPrivate sector participation in infrastructure in West Bengal is relatively undeveloped. The\nWest  Bengal  Industrial  Development  Corporation  is  the  lead  agency  promoting  private\nparticipation in industry and infrastructure in West Bengal. In June 1997, IWIN started operations\nto  promote  and  facilitate  the  development  of  the  state\u2019s  infrastructure  through  private\nparticipation.  The  West  Bengal  Transport  Infrastructure  Development  Corporation  commenced\n\n\f12\n\noperations in 1998 to develop transport schemes on a commercial basis. The first build-operate-\ntransfer project in West Bengal, the Vivekananda Flyover in Kolkata, has been tendered.\n\n43.\nPrivate sector participation involves balancing the interest of government, users, and the\nprivate  entity.  The  existing  West  Bengal  statutory  and  regulatory  setup  is  not  conducive  to  the\ncomplex  contractual  agreements  required  for  private  participation.  Therefore  a  private  sector\nparticipation  framework  is  needed  to  facilitate  private  sector  financing  of  infrastructure.  The\ndevelopment  of  the  private  participation  enabling  framework  would  require  the  following  phased\nand sequential actions:\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nestablish  a  policy  framework  so  that  the  Government  can  evolve  clear  objectives\nand goals;\n\namend  existing  legislation  or  proposals  for  new  legislation  using  a  time-bound\nprogram \nto  cost-effective  private  sector  participation\narrangements;\n\nto  remove  obstacles \n\n(iii) \n\nenhance the capacity of various Government departments, to participate effectively\nin promoting and developing private sector participation;\n\n(iv) \n\nprovide an effective institutional framework to implement the program;\n\nextend  private  sector  participation  to  other  infrastructure  sectors,  based  on  the\nlearning experience of the North-South Corridor Project;\n\nenact  the  West  Bengal  Infrastructure  Development  Act  governing  private  sector\nparticipation in the development of all forms of infrastructure projects; and\n\n(vii) \n\nset  up  of  regulatory  authorities  to  oversee  tariff  setting,  investments,  competition,\nand service levels. The regulatory authorities can be sector specific.\n\n44.\nTA 3142 (footnote 1) identified a number of projects in the West Bengal corridor with the\npotential for private participation. Two of these are the Haldia-Uluberiya expressway and Raiganj-\nIslampur  cutoff.  The  development  of  these  projects  as  public-private  partnerships  will  provide\nvaluable  lessons  in  private  sector  participation,  and  if  successful,  will  serve  as  a  model  for\nreplication elsewhere in the state and for other forms of infrastructure.\n\nIV.\n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT\n\nA. \n\nRationale\n\n45.\nGood  transport  infrastructure  is  recognized  as  a  prerequisite  and  foundation  on  which\ngovernments  can  plan  and  implement  their  economic  and  social  development  programs.  The\ndevelopment  of  the  West  Bengal  Corridor  with  the  improvement  of  access  and  capacity  will\nremove a critical bottleneck in the movement of freight and passengers from the northern parts of\nWest Bengal, the northeastern states of India, and neighboring Bhutan and Nepal to the ports of\nKolkata and Haldia. The north-south transport corridor in West Bengal extends from Haldia port\nvia Kolkata (also a river port) to the northern parts of West Bengal. In northern West Bengal, the\ncorridor  divides  into  routes  to  Nepal  and  Sikkim  to  the  west;  and  Assam,  Bhutan,  and  the\nnortheastern  states  of  India  to  the  east.  Along  the  corridor  are  several  eastward  links  to\nBangladesh.  A  large  portion  of  the  north-south  transport  corridor  and  the  eastward  links  to\n\n\f13\n\nBangladesh  are  in  urgent  need  of  improvement  from  the  current  deteriorated  two-lane,\nintermediate  lane,  and  single-lane  standards.  NH  34,  which  forms  the  spine  of  the  north-south\ntransport system, provides the nearest access to ports (Kolkata and Haldia) for the northeastern\nstates of India and neighboring Bhutan and Nepal, which are landlocked. Two state highways (SH\n1 and SH 10) provide links from the border with Bangladesh to the West Bengal corridor and the\nIndian national road network. An efficient transport system along the West Bengal corridor will not\nonly  provide  the  basis  for  economic  growth  and  poverty  reduction  in  West  Bengal,  but  will  also\nhave significant implications for improving subregional economic cooperation by increasing trade\nand  other  economic  activities.  The  ability  of  regions  and  countries  to  grow  rapidly  depends  on\ntheir  capacity  to  link  with  regional  and  global  markets.  Connectivity  through  improved  transport\nhas important implications for poverty reduction by offering new economic opportunities through\nbetter market linkages and increased employment possibilities.\n\n46.\nIn  1998,  ADB  provided  TA  (footnote  1)  to  help  GWB  prepare  a  strategy  and  investment\nplan for the development of the north-south corridor. The TA study, which was completed in June\n2000,  identified  a  number  of  high  priority  multimodal  transport  infrastructure  components  for\nfinancing  and  implementation  through  a  mixture  of  Government  budget  and  public-private\npartnerships.  The  highest  priority  component  in  terms  of  economic  development  and  poverty\nreduction  impacts,  strategic  importance,  and  suitability  for  public  funding  is  the  improvement  of\nNH 34, which is the artery of the north-south transport corridor. The improvement of the two state\nhighways that connect NH 34 to the Bangladesh border will enhance the subregional role of the\nnorth-south  corridor  in  West  Bengal.  Two  other  priority  components,  the  connections  between\nHaldia  and  Kolkata,  and  the  national  highway  network  are  being  examined  through  detailed\nfeasibility  studies  funded  by  the  NHAI  and  will  be  considered  for  ADB  financing  under  the  next\nphase  of  corridor  development.  Meanwhile,  two  other  corridor  sections,  the  Haldia-Uluberiya\nexpressway  and  the  Raiganj-Islampur  cut  off,  which  have  the  potential  for  private  participation,\nare being developed as public-private partnership projects.\n\nB.\n\nObjectives and Scope\n\n47.\nThe objective of the Project is to support the development of a transport corridor in West\nBengal  that  will  promote  subregional  economic  activities,  reduce  poverty,  and  facilitate  trade  by\nremoving critical capacity constraints and improving transport efficiency. Because of the strategic\nlocation  of  the  north-south  corridor,  an  improved  transport  system  will  facilitate  subregional\neconomic cooperation, in addition to supporting rural development and increasing the earnings of\nlow-income groups by enhancing the mobility of rural communities.\n\n48.\nThe Project will (i) enhance access along the north-south corridor; (ii) upgrade subregional\nconnections to the border with Bangladesh; and (iii) provide rural communities in the districts of\nthe  project  area  with  access  to  markets,  schools,  hospitals,  other  social  services,  and\nemployment  opportunities.  Through  policy  dialogue  carried  out  during  project  processing,  a\ncorridor  and  sector  development  framework  was  developed  to  promote  (i)  sound  corridor\ndevelopment  and  management  policies,  and  (ii)  improve  the  policy  environment  for  the  efficient\ndelivery of transport infrastructure in West Bengal. The Project will also strengthen environmental\nand social governance through mitigation measures in the design, construction, and operation of\nthe Project.\n\n\f14\n\nThe investment component of the Project will comprise (i) improvement of about 370 km of\n49.\nNH 34 from Barasat to Raiganj; (ii) improvement of about 150 km of state highways: SH 10 from\nGajol to Hilli and SH 1 from Chakda to Bangaon; (iii) rehabilitation of about 100 km of rural access\nroads;  (iv)  consulting  services  for  design  and  construction  supervision;  (v)  project  management;\nand  (vi)  land  acquisition,  resettlement  activities,  relocation  of  utilities,  and  tree  replanting.  The\nproject  roads  pass  through  the  West  Bengal  districts  of  Maldah,  Murshidabad,  Nadia,  North  24\nParganas and Uttar Dinajpur.\n\nNH 34 will be improved to a two-lane facility comprising 7 meters (m) carriageway and 2 x\n50.\n2.5  m  paved  shoulders  plus  2  x  1.5  m  earth  soft  verge.  In  the  heavily  trafficked  sections  and\ncongested  towns  of  Baharampur,  Ingraj  Bazar,  Kaliachak  Bazar,  Maldah  and  Raiganj,  the  road\nwill be four-lane with a 14 m pavement with median. The design of the pavement is in accordance\nwith the Indian Roads Congress and international design guidelines. The state highways will be\nimproved to a two-lane standard (7 m carriageway with 1.5 m paved shoulder on either side and 1\nm  soft  verge  beyond  that).  A  detailed  description  of  the  road  improvements,  including  the  road\nsafety,  social,  and  environmental  features  is  given  in  Appendix  4.  The  rural  access  roads\ncomponent will involve improving roads, small bridges, and other rural infrastructure in the project\narea to provide rural communities access to NH 34, SH 10, and SH 1; and therefore to markets,\nemployment  opportunities,  and  social  services.  The  low-cost  rural  transport  infrastructure  to  be\nconstructed  or  improved  will  be  selected  in  accordance  with  the  following  criteria:  (i)  uses  the\ncommunity  participatory  approaches  for  project  identification;  (ii)  provides  the  poor  and\ndisadvantaged  groups  with  access \nto  markets,  schools,  hospitals,  social  services  and\nemployment opportunities; (iii) connects rural communities to the project roads; (iv) does not have\nsignificant  adverse  environmental  impact;  (v)  requires  minimal  land  acquisition  and  no  major\nstructural removal; and (vi) has arrangements for community maintenance. A tentative list of rural\ntransport infrastructure improvements has been finalized. The supervision consultants will assist\nwith  the  design,  procurement,  and  implementation;  and  will  conduct  a  baseline  survey  at  the\ncommencement of the Project to develop monitorable poverty and development impact indicators.\n\nC.\n\nCost Estimates\n\n51.\nThe total cost of the Project is estimated at $323 million equivalent, of which the foreign\nexchange  cost  is  estimated  at  $204  million  representing  63  percent  of  the  total  cost.  The  local\ncurrency cost, including taxes and duties, is estimated at $119 million equivalent representing 37\npercent  of  the  total  cost.  The  project  cost  estimates  are  summarized  in  Table  1  and  detailed  in\nAppendix 5.\n\n\fTable 1: Summary of Cost Estimates\n($ million)\n\nItem\n\nForeign\nExchange\n\nLocal\nCurrency\n\n15\n\n0.0\n147.4\n12.6\n0.0\n\n160.0\n\n26.5\n\n2.1\n15.4\n204.0\n63\n\nTotal\nCost\n\n18.6\n226.7\n15.5\n4.6\n\n265.4\n\n40.1\n\n2.1\n15.4\n323.0\n100\n\n18.6\n79.3\n2.9\n4.6\n\n105.4\n\n13.6\n\n0.0\n0.0\n119.0\n37\n\nA.

The  remaining  local\ncurrency  cost  of  $113  million  equivalent  will  be  met  by  the  central  Government  and  GWB.  The\nproposed local currency financing by ADB is minimal and amounts to only about 2 percent of the\ntotal  project  cost  and  3  percent  of  the  proposed  ADB  loan;  it  can  be  justified  because  (i)  of  the\nadministrative convenience of ADB financing the entire costs relating to consulting services, and\n(ii) the financing is for rural access roads.\n\n53.\nThe  loan  will  have  a  25-year  term,  including  a  grace  period  of  5  years,  an  interest  rate\ndetermined in accordance with ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility; a commitment charge of 0.75\npercent per annum; a front-end fee of 1.0 percent; conversions options that may be exercised in\naccordance  with  the  terms  of  the  draft  Loan  Agreement,  the  Loan  Regulations,  and  ADB\u2019s\nConversion Guidelines; and other terms and conditions set forth in the draft Loan Agreement. The\nGovernment  has  provided  ADB  with  (i)  the  reasons  for  India\u2019s  decision  to  borrow  under  ADB\u2019s\nLIBOR-based  lending  facility  on  the  basis  of  these  terms  and  conditions  and  (ii)  an  undertaking\nthat  these  choices  were  India\u2019s  own  independent  decision  and  not  made  in  reliance  on  any\ncommunication  or  advice  from  ADB.  The  portion  of  the  loan  relating  to  the  state  highways  and\nrural access roads components, for $61.3 million, will be on-lent to GWB.

Implementation Arrangements\n\n1. \n\nProject Management\n\n54.\nMORTH will be the Executing Agency for the national highway component of the Project\nand WBPWRD for the state highway and rural access components. MORTH and WBPWRD have\nadequate  experience  gained  from  the  implementation  of  ADB\u2019s  first  and  second  projects  in  the\nroad subsector (footnote 7).\n\nThe Project will be implemented by project implementation units (PIU) under MORTH for\n55.\nthe  national  highway  component  and  WBPWRD  for  the  state  highway  and  rural  access  roads\ncomponents.  The  PIU  will  be  staffed  with  experienced  personnel  both  at  the  management  level\nand  at  the  project  site.  The  PIU  will  be  delegated  sufficient  administrative  authority  for  effective\nand  timely  decision  making  on  project  implementation  matters.  Staff  from  MORTH,  WBPWRD\nand  the  PIU  have  received  training  in  contract  management  and  social  development,  including\nresettlement,  under  two  ongoing  ADB  advisory  TAs  for  construction  management  and  social\ndevelopment.10\n\n2.\n\nImplementation Schedule\n\n56.\nThe Project will be implemented over 60 months, inclusive of design and preconstruction\nactivities,  and  is  expected  to  be  completed  by  June  2006.  A  summary  project  implementation\nschedule  is  given  in  Appendix  6.  The  implementation  schedule  allows  for  land  acquisition  and\nresettlement  activities,  and  the  clearance  of  all  utilities  and  trees  from  the  right-of-way  (ROW).\nThese are to be undertaken prior to the award of the civil works contracts.\n\n                  \n\n10 TA No. 3361-IND: Capacity Building for Contract Supervision and Management in NHAI, for $600,000, approved on 2\nDecember  1999;  and  TA  3365-IND:  Capacity Building for Social Development,  for  $800,000,  approved  on  23\nDecember 1999.\n\n\f17\n\n3.\n\nProcurement\n\n57.\nProcurement  of  the  civil  works  contract  packages  for  the  national  and  state  highway\ncomponents  will  be  undertaken  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement following\ninternational  competitive  bidding  procedures.  The  contractors  will  be  selected  from  prequalified\nbidders.  Based  on  the  experience  of  ADB\u2019s  earlier  road  projects,  the  contract  packages  were\nmade  sufficiently  large  to  attract  experienced  contractors.  The  contracts  for  the  rural  access\ncomponent  will  be  let  under  local  competitive  bidding  procedures  using  the  Government\u2019s\nstandard  bidding  documents,  which  ADB  reviewed  and  accepted.  ADB  has  approved  advance\naction for the civil works procurement on the understanding that such approval would not commit\nADB to finance the Project. Advance procurement action would allow MORTH and WBPWRD to\ncommence work on preconstruction activities and will shorten the implementation period by about\nnine months. A list of contract packages and the mode of procurement are given in Appendix 7.\n\n58.\nSince the disbursements under the Project will be mainly for civil works and consultants,\nthe direct payment and reimbursement procedures will be used in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan\nDisbursement Handbook dated January 2001. An imprest account will be provided in accordance\nwith  ADB\u2019s  guidelines  to  expedite  disbursements.  The  initial  amount  to  be  deposited  in  the\nimprest account will not exceed the equivalent of $10,000,000.\n\n4.\n\nConsulting Services\n\n59.\nInternationally  recruited  consultants  will  assist  MORTH  and  WBPWRD  with  detailed\ndesign and construction supervision of the road improvement to be carried out under the Project.\nThe  outline  terms  of  reference  and  the  person-month  requirements  for  the  detailed  design  and\nconstruction supervision services have been agreed to by MORTH and WBPWRD, and are given\nin  Appendix  8.  The  consultants  will  be  recruited  by  MORTH  and  WBPWRD  in  accordance  with\nADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for the\nengagement  of  domestic  consultants.  ADB  has  approved  advance  action  for  the  recruitment  of\nthe  design  and  construction  supervision  consultants  on  the  understanding  that  such  approval\ndoes not commit ADB to finance the Project.\n\n5.\n\nProject Supervision\n\n60.\nA  project  inception  mission  will  be  fielded  soon  after  approval  of  the  proposed  loan  to\ninitiate the project implementation process. MORTH, WBPWRD and ADB will review the overall\nprogress of the Project annually in addition to a comprehensive midterm review to be conducted\nafter  24  months  of  loan  effectivity.  Should  the  results  of  such  reviews  indicate  serious\nimplementation  problems,  MORTH,  WBPWRD  and  ADB  will  agree  on  appropriate  measures,\nincluding changes to implementation arrangements, to ensure that the project objectives are met.\n\n6.\n\nProgress Reports, Project Benefit Monitoring, Accounts and Audit\n\n61.\nTo monitor project implementation, MORTH and WBPWRD will submit quarterly progress\nreports  to  ADB.  Within  six  months  of  the  physical  completion  of  the  Project,  MORTH  and\nWBPWRD  will  prepare  and  provide  ADB  with  a  project  completion  report  covering  details  of\nproject  implementation  costs  and  benefit  monitoring  and  evaluation  activities.  MORTH  and\nWBPWRD will, with the assistance of the supervision consultants, undertake project performance\nmonitoring  and  evaluation  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s Project Performance Management System\nHandbook.  The  performance  indicators  that  will  be  monitored  include traffic levels, number of\n\n\f18\n\naccidents,  travel  time,  road  roughness,  freight  costs,  and  passenger  fares.  MORTH  and\nWBPWRD  will  maintain  separate  records  of  project  expenditures  and  funding  received  for  the\nProject  and  prepare  annual  project  accounts.  The  project  accounts  and  related  financial\nstatements will be audited by external auditors acceptable to ADB and submitted to ADB within\nnine months of the end of each fiscal year.\n\nG.\n\nEnvironmental and Social Measures\n\n1. \n\nEnvironment\n\n62.\nThe environmental category of the Project is B. An initial environmental examination was\nconducted  during  project  preparation  based  on  ADB\u2019s  Environmental Guidelines for Selected\nInfrastructure Development Projects, and  its  summary  is  presented  in  Appendix  9.  The  findings\nindicate  that  the  Project  will  not  cause  any  significant  adverse  environmental  impacts  as  the\nproposed highway improvements will not involve major realignment. No cultural or heritage areas,\nprotected  areas,  wetlands,  or  other  environmentally  sensitive  areas  will  be  disturbed.\nConstruction-related environmental impacts will be minimized by adopting good construction site\nmanagement  and  engineering  practices.  The  State  Forest  Department  and  the  Office  of  the\nDistrict Collector will be involved in the plans for tree felling and compensatory afforestation. An\nenvironmental  management  action  plan  has  been  prepared,  consistent  with \ninitial\nenvironmental examination, and will be implemented by MORTH and WBPWRD with assistance\nfrom  the  supervision  consultants.  MORTH  and  WBPWRD  will  monitor  and  report  on  the\nimplementation  of  the  action  plan  through  the  monthly  progress  reports.  Adequate  funds  are\nincluded in the project budget for this purpose.\n\nthe \n\n2.\n\nSocial\n\n63.\nA  detailed  social  analysis  was  carried  out  during  project  preparation  in  accordance  with\nADB\u2019s guidelines. During the social impact assessment, the census-survey teams conducted over\n30  meetings  with  primary  and  secondary  stakeholders  on  the  road  alignments.  The  meetings\nwere typically attended by the affected people, local community leaders, village panchayat heads,\nstate, and local WBPWRD officials. Women and other vulnerable groups were also consulted on\nthe  project  impact.  The  communities  were  all  supportive  of  the  Project  owing  to  the  significant\neconomic benefits to be generated by improving the national and state highways and rural access\nroads:  improved  transportation  and  new  opportunities  for  business  for  local  communities.  The\nsocial impact analysis also indicates that the adverse impacts of the Project would be minimal. As\nthe  Government  already  largely  owns  the  ROW  required  to  improve  NH  34,  SH  1,  and  SH  10,\nland acquisition will be minimal. The Resettlement Plan (RP) for the Project was prepared by the\nGovernment,  and  will  be  implemented  in  consultation  with  state  authorities  and  the  people\naffected in accordance with ADB\u2019s policy on involuntary resettlement.11 The total expenditure for\nthe RP is estimated at Rs618 million.\n\n64.\nThe  principal  adverse  social  impacts  will  be  dislocation  of  the  roadside  small  business\nenterprises. A census conducted in February\u2013March (2001) generated a full inventory of assets\nand  nature  of  losses  by  those  to  be  relocated.  About  9,200  small  business  enterprises,1,300\nhouseholds, and 452 community properties will be affected. These are largely squatters/informal\nsettlers  and  encroachers  on  the  ROW,  particularly  around  bus  stops,  road  intersections,  rural\nmarkets,  and  town  centers.

This  will  be\ncarried  out  through  formal  leasing  or  contract  agreement  with  WBPWRD.  This  strategy  will\nenhance the movement of through traffic and improve road safety as well as ensure control over\nROW  for  future  obstruction-free  improvement  to  four  lanes.  This  strategy  constitutes  \u201cbest\npractice\u201d  in  road  development.  WBPWRD  is  currently  conducting  site-specific  pilot  studies  for\nROW management and development (including drainage, solid waste management, etc.) for local\nbusinesses and markets with clearly demarcated safety zones for through traffic. This will reduce\nthe  overall  impact  on  affected  people,  particularly  the  most  vulnerable,  and  assist  in  restoring\nbusinesses and livelihoods.\n\n65.\nThe  summary  RP,  which  is  based  on  ADB\u2019s  policy  and  guidelines  for  involuntary\nresettlement is given in Appendix 10. The absence of formal land titles by affected people will not\nbe  a  bar  to  assistance  and  rehabilitation.  The  resettlement  principles  adopted  will  provide\ncompensation for lost assets at replacement cost, irrespective of ownership status, and for loss of\nincome  and \ntransfer  costs  during\nreestablishment plus income restoration measures in the case of lost livelihood. GWB will publish\nthe  RP,  using  project  brochures  in  the  local  language  to  explain  the  impact,  resettlement\nassistance, and relocation policy for those affected, and tentative implementation schedule.

This \n\nincludes \n\n66.\nThe social analysis of the Project indicates that a number of interrelated social and health\nissues such as road safety, trafficking of women and children, and the spread of HIV/AIDS12 need\nto be addressed. The improvement of the project roads have been designed with the objective of\nsafer roads with reduced disruption of livelihoods, and better management of the ROW for future\nroad  expansion  and  development.  The  RP  also  has  provisions  for  improving  awareness  about\nroad  safety,  trafficking  of  women  and  children,  sex  trade,  and  spread  of  sexually  transmitted\ndiseases  (STD)  in  the  project  area  through  local  nongovernment  organizations  and  community\ninvolvement. In addition, the project design includes (i) offset/symmetrical widening to avoid built-\nup areas; (ii) paved shoulders for slow-moving and nonmotorized traffic; (iii) addition of bus/truck\nparking  or  road  turnouts  for  improved  road  safety;  (iv)  provision  for  road  signs  at  pedestrian\ncrossings  and  bus  stations;  and  (v)  public  amenities  such  as  rest  rooms  and  telephone  booths.\nThe  project  civil  works  contracts  will  include  the  requirement  for  an  information  and  education\ncampaign  on  STDs  and  HIV/AIDS  for  construction  workers  as  part  of  the  health  and  safety\nprogram  at  the  campsites  during  the  construction  period.  The  contractor  will,  through  a  suitably\nexperienced  nongovernment  organization,  extend  the  campaign  to  surrounding  communities\nliving  in  the  project  influence  area.  The  construction  supervision  consultant  will  monitor  and\ncontrol  the  contractor\u2019s  performance  of  these  activities,  including  the  use  of  child  labor.  An\nongoing ADB  regional TA  13 aims to increase awareness in Bangladesh, India, and Nepal of the\ntrafficking  of  women  and  children,  and  to  help  them  formulate  and  implement  country  and\nsubregional action plans to prevent and reduce in-country and subregional trafficking.\n\n67.\nAIDS has been recognized as a serious public health issue in India since the late 1980s.\nThe Government of India prepared its first Medium-Term Plan for Prevention and Control of AIDS\nwith  World  Health  Organization  support  in  1989.  A  more  comprehensive  Strategic  Plan  for\nPrevention  and  Control  of  AIDS  in  India  was  prepared  with  funding  from  the  World  Bank\u2019s  First\n\n                  \n\n12 HIV/AIDS refers to Human Immunodeficiency Virus/Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome.\n13 TA  5948-REG:  Combating  Trafficking  of Women  and  Children  in  South  Asia,  for  $440,000,  approved  on  14\n\nNovember 2000.\n\n\f20\n\nNational  HIV/AIDS  Control  Project  (1992).  India\u2019s  HIV/AIDS  program,  which  is  managed  by  the\nNational  AIDS  Control  Organization,  aims  to  (i)  strengthen  management  capacity  at  the  center\nand  in  states,  (ii)  promote  public  awareness,  (iii)  improve  blood  safety,  (iv)  build  surveillance\ncapacity,  and  (v)  improve  control  of  sexually  transmitted  diseases.  The  national  organization  is\nto  produce  effective  community-based\nfocusing  on  developing  complementary  activities \ninterventions to promote behavioral change.\n\n68.\nGWB  recognizes  the  need  for  effective  community-based  interventions,  and  that  sex\nworkers  and  their  clients  are  priority  groups  for  focused  STD  services,  and  condom  promotion,\nand  behavioral  change.  GWB  has  established  the  West  Bengal  State  AIDS  Preventive  and\nControl  Society.  The  specific  objectives  of  the  strategic  action  plan  for  West  Bengal  include  (i)\ntargeted intervention, STD control and condom programming; (ii) prevention of infection in low risk\npopulations; (iii) surveillance, training, research and development, and institutional strengthening;\n(iv)  capacity  building  for  care  and  support;  and  (v)  collaboration  with  the  public  and  private\nsectors.    West  Bengal  also  received  assistance  under  the  World  Bank\u2019s  Second  National\nHIV/AIDS Control Project.\n\nto \n\nthe  United  Kingdom  will  contribute \n\nThe  West  Bengal  Sexual  Health  Project,  funded  by  the  Department  for  International\n69.\nDevelopment  (DFID)  of \nthe  development  of  a\ncomprehensive  state-wide  sexual  health  program  by  collaborating  with  a  wide  range  of\ngovernment  and  nongovernment  groups,  and  by  building  a  consultative  process  into  its\nmanagement  structures.  The  Sexual  Health  Project  aims  to  reduce  the  spread  of  the  HIV\nepidemic and its social and economic impact in West Bengal, by improving sexual health in the\nproject-supported communities. Among the achievements to date are (i) since May 1996, over 45\ncapacity-building  events/training  workshops  have  been  organized;  (ii)  over  550,000  people  are\npotentially  being  covered;  (iii)  a  cadre  of  about  200  trained  outreach  workers,  community\ninfluencers and peer educators are implementing sexual health programs; and (iv) 45 clinics are\noperational  and  covering  52  intervention  sites  in  Kolkata  and  seven  districts.  Another  HIV/STD\nprevention  project  funded  by  DFID  is  the  Healthy  Highways  Truckers  Project.  The  project\nobjective  is  to  improve  access  to  health  services  by  creating,  throughout  India,  a  coordinated\nnetwork of about 300 sexual health truck stops located at the key stops already used by truckers\nfor rest, recreation, or the transhipment of goods. These centers will be managed by a variety of\nservice  providers  to  improve  the  sexual  health  of  truckers  and  their  sexual  partners.  These\nservices will have three key elements: peer counseling, promotion of condoms, and standardized\nSTD treatment.\n\nV.\n\nPROJECT JUSTIFICATION\n\nA.\n\nEconomic Analysis\n\nThe economic evaluation of the Project, comprising improvements to NH 34, SH 1 and SH\n70.\n10, is based on the comparison of the with- and without-project situations. Without the Project, the\nexisting  intermediate  to  two-lane  road  will  become  even  more  heavily  congested  and  vehicle\nspeeds  will  fall  to  lower  levels.  Accelerated  pavement  deterioration  through  increased  use  will\nraise  road  maintenance  costs.  With  the  Project,  the  road  will  be  improved  with  wide  paved\nshoulders  for  slow-moving  and  nonmotorized  traffic,  which  will  increase  capacity,  resulting  in\nvehicle operating cost savings, maintenance cost savings, and shortened travel time. The option\nto  widen  the  project  road  to  four  lanes  was  also  investigated  during  project  preparation,  but  the\ntwo-lane option was found to be the current least-cost solution.\n\n\f21\n\nEconomic  evaluations  were  carried  out  for  the  three  project  analysis  sections  of  NH  34,\n71.\nSH 1 and SH 10, as well as for the Project as a whole. To estimate the economic internal rate of\nreturn (EIRR), benefit streams were calculated for 20 years, which is the estimated economic life\nof  the  improvements  under  the  Project.  Benefits  and  costs  were  estimated  net  of  duties  and\ntaxes, and are expressed in constant May 2001 prices. Improvement costs include provision for\ncivil works by contract, acquisition of ROW, and construction supervision. The base EIRR for the\nProject is estimated at 21 percent, while the EIRRs for sections analyzed vary between 15 and 25\npercent. Details of the traffic analysis and EIRR calculation are given in Appendix 11.\n\n72.\nThe sensitivity of the EIRR to changes in the underlying benefit and cost parameters was\nanalyzed.  This  was  undertaken  for  each  section  of  the  project  roads  and  for  the  Project  as  a\nwhole. The results of this analysis are shown in Table A11.11 of Appendix 11. The scenario of an\nincrease in capital costs of 20 percent and a fall in the level of benefits by 20 percent reduces the\nEIRR  for  the  overall  Project  from  21.3  to  14.9  percent.  The  switching  value14  for  cost  was\ndetermined to be 87 percent, and the switching value for benefits 47 percent.\n\nThe  estimated  direct  benefits  of  NH  34,  SH  10,  and  SH  1  to  the  economy  are  Rs4,804\n73.\nmillion, Rs643 million, and Rs140 million respectively in present value terms. The direct benefits\nfor the Project as a whole are Rs5,587 million in present value terms. These figures represent the\nsum  of  the  present  value  of  benefits  to  passengers,  freight  users,  vehicle  owners,  and  the\nGovernment. These are conservative estimates, because only direct benefits of the Project have\nbeen considered. The distribution analysis (Table 3) is based on the existing situation in the road\ntransport  industry  and  an  estimate  of  how  this  will  develop  in  the  future.  The  freight  transport\nindustry  is  fully  competitive  in  determining  freight  rates,  but  the  passenger  transport  industry  is\nregulated  and  fares  are  set  by  the  state.  The  passenger  transport  industry  may  be  gradually\nderegulated in the future. Freight owners and operators presently pass on part of the savings they\nreceive through lower vehicle operating costs to freight users. Bus owners and operators will pass\non  more  of  the  savings  they  receive  from  reduced  vehicle  operating  costs  once  the  industry  is\nfully deregulated.\n\nTable 3: Distribution of Net Benefits\n(Rs million)\n\nFinancial\nPresent\nNational\nValue\n\nEconomic Economic Passenger Freight\nPresent\nValue\n\nFinancial\n\nUsers\n\nUsers\n\nVehicle Government\nOwners\n\nEconomy\n\nNet\n\n11,978\n\n11,978\n\n136\n\n2,638\n\n8,413\n\nItem\nBenefits\nRoad User Benefits\nCosts\nCapital Cost\nO&M Cost\n\n(7,803)\n   646\n\n(6,968)\n   577\n\n835\n(69)\n\n791\n\n835\n(69)\n\nNet Present Value\n\n(7,157)\n\n12,744\n\n136\n136\n\n2,638\n2,638\n\n8,413\n8,413\n\n1,557\n(5,600)\n\n5,587\n\n5,587\nGains and\nLosses\n\nNote: The net loss to the government/economy (minus 5,600) is calculated as minus 7,157 + 1,557.\nO&M = operation and maintenance.\nSource = Feasibility study and Mission.\n\n                  \n\n14 The switching value shows the percentage increase in a cost variable (or decline in a benefit variable) required for the\nnet present value (NPV) to become zero, which is the same as the EIRR reducing to the cutoff level of 12 percent.\n\n\f22\n\nThe benefits to both passenger and freight users will be distributed between the people in\n74.\nthe  direct  influence  of  the  project  area  and  those  outside  the  project  area.  In  terms  of  the\ndistribution of benefits in the project area, a recent study found that approximately 80 percent of\nall  vehicles  originated  or  were  destined  for  districts  in  the  project  area,  the  remaining  traffic\noriginated or was destined for other parts of India or neighboring countries. Thus about 80 percent\nof  the  benefits  are  assumed  to  accrue  to  the  people  in  the  project  area.  In  terms  of  passenger\nbenefits, which represent benefits to bus users, a large part of this benefit will be passed to the\npoor  in  the  project  area  as  they  use  public  transport.  The  benefits  to  freight  users  will  be\ndistributed between enterpreneurs who tend to purchase freight services after they have bought,\nin  bulk,  the  produce  of  several  different  farmers,  and  also  between  some  of  the  rural  poor  who\nship  their  own  agricultural  produce  directly.    The  largest  part  of  net  benefits  go  to  the  vehicle\nowners themselves, who are car, bus, and truck owners and operators.\n\n75.\nBesides  vehicle  operating  cost  savings,  the  Project  is  expected  to  contribute  several\nnonquantifiable  benefits  including  the  provision  of  more  reliable  transport  services.  This  will\nenable  the  more  efficient  distribution  of  goods  and  services,  including  industrial  and  agricultural\ninputs  and  outputs;  provide  easier  access  to  social  services  and  markets;  and  increase  the\nmobility of people and their employment opportunities.\n\nB.\n\nPoverty Impact\n\n76.\nTransport  has  direct  impacts  on  the  personal  welfare  of  all  income  groups.  Access  to  at\nleast  minimal  infrastructure  services  is  one  of  the  essential  components  of  personal  welfare.\nImprovements in transport not only provide people with more convenient access to a broad range\nof  socioeconomic  opportunities,  but  also  have  strong  income  effects  by  lowering  transport  cost\nand hence the prices of consumer goods and services. For the poor, the lack of affordable access\ndeprives them of the ability to take advantage of job opportunities and even of very basic social\nservices. Reliable access to schools and health services for the poor contributes directly to their\naccumulation  of  human  capital,  which  is  a  key  factor  in  sustainable  poverty  reduction.\nImprovement of the transport system in the West Bengal corridor will bring significant benefits to\nthe  economy  of  West  Bengal,  as  well  as  social  and  economic  benefits  to  the  19  million  people\nliving  in  the  project  influence  area.  Improved  access  will  help  reduce  poverty  by  (i)  increasing\nlabor mobility, particularly to distant markets; (ii) increasing employment opportunities offered by\naccelerated  industrialization;  (iii)  reducing  loss  of  perishables,  thereby  allowing  for  increased\nfarmgate  prices;  (iv)  improving  access  to  rural  areas  by  health,  school,  veterinary,  and  rural\ndevelopment  workers;  (v)  providing  greater  opportunities  for  tribal  members,  mostly  itinerant\ncasual  workers,  to  access  income  and  employment  opportunities;  and  (vi)  generating  transport-\nassociated  small  businesses  such  as  service  stations,  wayside  foodstalls,  and  guesthouses.  A\nsummary of the poverty and development impacts of the Project is given in Appendix 12.\n\nThe project area covers five districts, namely, North 24-Parganas, Maldah, Murshidabad,\n77.\nNadia,  and Uttar Dinajpur. The population of these districts is approximately 19.5 million, which is\nabout  29  percent  of  the  total  population  of  West  Bengal.  Of  the  population  in  these  districts,\napproximately  76  percent  live  in  rural  areas.  Per  capita  income  varies  between  the  districts,\nranging from Rs1,776 in Uttar Dinajpur to Rs2,351 in North 24-Parganas. The poor are classified\nas  those  whose  annual  (five-member)  family  income  lies  below  Rs15,000  per  annum  and  is\nreferred to as the population living below the poverty line as defined by GWB. Recent estimates\nby  the  National  Sample  Survey  Organization  for  2000  show  that  approximately  27  percent  of\npeople in West Bengal are living below the poverty line, which is 1 percent higher  than  the figure\n\n\f23\n\nfor India as a whole at 26 percent. From recent data in West Bengal, the estimate of poor people\nin the districts through which the project road passes is shown in the Table 4:\n\nTable 4: Percentage of Poor by Project District\n\nDistrict\n\n% Poor\n\nNorth 24 Parganas\nNadia\nMurshidabad\nMaldah\nUttar Dinajpur\nSource: Feasibility study.\n\n32\n31\n31\n33\n32\n\n78.\nRural  development  funding  throughout  West  Bengal  amounted  to  Rs4,089  million  in\nFY2000/01.  Expenditure  in  previous  years  was  Rs3,663  million  in  FY  1999/2000,  and  Rs2,780\nmillion in FY1998/99. The Public Works Department is undertaking rural roads construction under\nthe  Rural  Development  Department.  A  20-year  road  program  has  been  introduced  to  link  all\nvillages  with  a  population  of  1,500  and  above,  and  50  percent  of  the  villages  with  a  population\nbetween 1,000 to 1,500.15 Rural road schemes presently under construction are estimated to have\na total project cost of Rs4,974 million ($108 million). These roads total an approximate length of\n2,317 km, and include 221 individual roads. Other rural infrastructure is also being undertaken in\nthe  project  area  and  includes  irrigation  work,  improvements  to  canals  and  school  buildings,\nsericulture projects, and other small-scale improvements to rural infrastructure.\n\n79.\nIn  the  rural  areas  of  six  less  developed  districts  of  North  Bengal,  namely,  Malda,  Uttar\nDinajpur  (the  project  road  passes  through  these  two  districts),  Coochbehar,  Dakshin  Dinajpur,\nDarjeeling, and Jalpaiguri, special provisions have been made for implementing schemes relating\nto the construction and improvement of roads, bridges, culverts, embankments, drainage facilities,\nsanitation,  and  other  infrastructure  facilities.  The  total  2000/01  plan  expenditure  for  road\nrestoration and development in these districts is Rs170 million. The schemes under this program\nare  implemented  by  the  Zilla  and  Mahakuma  parishads.  The  following  are  taken  into  account\nwhen  devising  each  project:  (i)  the  entire  outlay  is  spent  on  the  rural  people  of  North  Bengal\ndistricts;  (ii)  employment  generation  is  the  main  objective  of  the  program,  thus  labor  intensive\nschemes are preferred; and (iii) environmental needs will be safeguarded during implementation.\n\nBesides road programs in West Bengal, several other infrastructure development projects\n80.\nreceiving international funding are having a direct impact on poverty reduction. The Netherlands\nGovernment  has  instituted  projects  in  irrigation,  soil  conservation,  and  soil  improvement  in  the\nnorth of West Bengal. The World Bank is conducting work in the agriculture sector, power sector,\nand  development  schemes  for  the  health  sector.  The  United  States  Agency  for  International\nDevelopment  has  supported  programs  to  promote  health  services,  and  food  aid  grants  for  the\npoor.  The  United  Kingdom  is  helping  to  reduce  poverty;  tackle  environmental  problems;  and\npromote the economic, social, political and legal status of women in all sectors. Japan attaches a\nhigh significance to poverty reduction programs focusing on medical care and health, agriculture,\nand rural development.\n\n15 In the Ninth Five-Year Plan, the fixed target is to construct 300 km of road connecting 800 villages.\n\n                  \n\n\fC.\n\nRisks\n\n24\n\n81.\nMeasures  such  as  advance  procurement  action,  use  of  ADB\u2019s  standard  tender\ndocumentation,  and  strengthened  project  management  arrangements  are  minimizing  potential\ndelays  in  project  implementation.  The  prequalification  criteria  and  packaging  of  the  civil  works\ncontracts will ensure that experienced contractors are selected. Civil works contracts will only be\nawarded after RP implementation, and when the rights to the land and clearance of utilities and\ntrees  are  obtained.  The  Government\u2019s  commitment  for  counterpart  funding  through  budgetary\nallocations will also be required prior to approval of contract award by ADB. The Government has\nassured  that  adequate  annual  budget  allocations  will  be  made  to  maintain  the  project  facilities\nafter  completion.  The  basic  assumptions  on  benefits  and  costs  for  the  EIRR  calculations  were\nsubjected to sensitivity tests under various adverse scenarios. The results indicate that the project\nEIRR is fairly robust in relation to changes in the basic assumptions.\n\nA.\n\nSpecific Assurances\n\nVI.\n\nASSURANCES\n\nThe  Government  has  given  the  following  assurances,  in  addition  to  the  standard\n\n82.\nassurances, which have been incorporated in the legal documents:\n\n (i) \n\n(ii) \n \n\n(iii) \n \n\n(iv) \n \n\nWithin  two  years  after  the  loan  becomes  effective,  ADB,  the  Government,  and\nGWB  will  carry  out  a  midterm  review \nto  (a)  evaluate  project  progress,\nimplementation  procedures,  procurement  methodology,  benefit  and  monitoring\nevaluation  activities,  and  performance  of  consultants;  and  (b)  recommend  any\ncorrective measures to remedy weaknesses identified.

Work includes the following:\n\n1.\n\n2.\n\n (i) \n\nApproximately  370  kilometers  (km)  of  existing  two-lane  highway  along  National\nHighway 34 (NH 34) will be rehabilitated and upgraded. Work will start at km 31,\nnear Barasat to the north of Kolkata on NH 34, and end at km 398, near Raiganj.\nThe terrain is generally flat with a gradual rise in ground elevation from south to\nnorth.  Road elevation above the surrounding terrain varies from ground level up\nto  3  meters  (m)  above  ground  level.  At  major  bridge  crossings  the  height  of  the\nhighway embankment reaches between 8\u201313 m above ground level. The highway\npasses  through  six  urban  centers  and  numerous  towns,  settlements,  market\nareas, and roadside commercial areas along its length.\n\nThe highway cross-section adopted is for two 3.5 m lanes with 2.5 m wide paved\nshoulders, giving a total width of 12 m. In the towns of Baharampur, Ingraj Bazar,\nKaliachak Bazar, Maldah, and Raiganj the highway cross-section will be for four\n3.5 m lanes with 1-1.5 m paved shoulders, giving a total paved width of 16-17 m.\nFor four-lane sections, a central median of 4 m has been adopted, but this will be\nreduced to a minimum of 1.2 m where space is restricted.\n\nThe  design  speed  adopted  is  100  km/hr  in  rural  areas  and  80  km/hr  in  urban\nareas.\n\nReconstruction  work  for  the  existing  pavements  will  consist  of  removing  and\nreconstructing  existing  shoulders;  reconstructing/widening  existing  embankment\nto suit the new cross-section; leveling course to existing pavement; providing new\ndense  bituminous  macadam  (DBM)  overlay;  and  new  Asphaltic  Concrete\nsurfacing.  The DBM layer will vary in thickness depending on the condition of the\nexisting pavement.\n\n(ii) \n \n\n(iii) \n \n\n(iv) \n \n\n(v) \n \n\nWidening and paving the shoulders has been adopted to allow for:\n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\n(c) \n\nSegregating  slow-  and  fast-moving  traffic.  This  will  assist  in  keeping  the\nmain  lanes  clear  for  fast-moving  traffic  and  improve  safety  by  reducing\npotential conflicts between different traffic categories.\nEmergency  parking.  This  will  assist  in  keeping  the  main  lanes  free  from\nobstructions that reduce capacity and pose a safety hazard.\nStructural support to main lanes.\n\n(vi) \n \n\nUnpaved or grass verges will be 1.5 m wide for two-lane roads and 1-1.5 m wide\nfor four-lane roads. They will function as a structural transition and accommodate\ntraffic  signs,  safety  guardrails,  route  signs,  lighting  columns,  and  other  road\nfurniture.

All  bridges  will  be  rehabilitated  and  widened  as  necessary.  Six  new\nroad-overpasses  will  be  constructed  at  major  railway  crossings  and  one  new\nroad-underpass. Two new river bridges will be constructed over the Mahananda\nand Bhagirathi rivers.\n\nVehicle  overloading  will  be  addressed  by  procurement  of  (a)  a  suitable\nweighbridge  for  installation  at  a  location  to  be  determined  under  the  Project,  in\nconsultation  with  Ministry  of  Road  Transport  and  Highways  and  Government  of\nWest Bengal; and (b) four sets of transportable axle weighers for use during axle-\nload  control  operations  along  the  project  road.

Work includes the following:\n\nThis component consists of rehabilitating and upgrading two state highways. The\nproject includes approximately 109.9 km of existing intermediate lane highway of\nSH 10. Work will start near Gazol, at the junction with NH 34, and end at Hilli on\nthe border with Bangladesh. On SH 1, the Project includes approximately 40 km\nof  existing  intermediate  lane  highway.  Work  will  start  at  Chakda,  at  the  junction\nwith NH 34, and end at Bangaon on the border with Bangladesh.\n\nThe highway cross-section adopted is for two 3.5 m lanes with 1.5 m wide paved\nshoulders, giving a total width of 10 m. In urban areas, the highway cross-section\nwill be for four 3 m lanes with 1 m paved shoulders, giving a total paved width of\n14 m. For four-lane sections a central median of 4 m has been adopted but this\nwill be reduced to a minimum of 1.2 m where space is restricted.\n\nThe design speed adopted is 80 km/hr in rural areas and 65 km/hr in urban areas.\n\nReconstruction  work  for  the  existing  pavements  will  consist  of  removing  and\nreconstructing  existing  shoulders;  reconstructing/widening  existing  embankment\nto suit the new cross-section; leveling course to existing pavement; providing new\nDBM  overlay;  and  new  asphaltic  concrete  surfacing.  The  DBM  layer  will  vary  in\nthickness depending on the condition of the existing pavement.\n\n(v) \n \n\nWidening and paving the shoulders has been adopted to allow for\n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\nSegregating  slow-  and  fast-moving  traffic.  This  will  assist  in  keeping  the\nmain  lanes  clear  for  fast-moving  traffic  and  improve  safety  by  reducing\npotential conflicts between different traffic categories.\n\nEmergency  parking.  This  will  assist  in  keeping  the  main  lanes  free  from\nobstructions that reduce capacity and pose a safety hazard.\n\n(c) \n\nStructural support to main lanes.\n\n\f4.\n\nSocial and Environmental Measures.

All existing culverts will\nbe rehabilitated and 103 new culverts will be constructed.\nUnpaved or grass verges will be 1.5 m wide for two-lane roads and 1 m wide for\nfour-lane  roads.    These  verges  will  function  as  a  structural  transition  and\naccommodate  traffic  signs,  safety  guardrails,  route  signs,  lighting  columns,  and\nother  road  furniture.    Verges  will  be  omitted  in  urban  areas  where  kerbed\nfootways will be provided.\n\nBus  stops  will  be  constructed  at  suitable  locations.  The  bus  stop  layout  will\ninclude  covered  shelters, \nfor\nshops/refreshment outlets where appropriate.  The designs will ensure that buses\nwill  be  directed  to  stopping  bays  off  the  main  highway  so  that  passengers  can\nsafely exit and enter buses.\n\nfacilities,  and  provision \n\ntoilets,  water \n\nRoadside parking will be constructed near markets, dhabas, truck loading areas,\nand  truck  repair  centers.    These  parking  areas  will  provide  appropriate  access\nroutes on and off the main highway and be sized to accommodate the needs of\neach particular location.\n\nIn flood-prone areas, the highway embankment will be raised.  The extent of this\nwork  will  be  defined  under  the  Project  after  hydrographic  and  hydraulic  studies\nhave been completed.\n\nThe design of all road junctions will be improved to include road markings, traffic\nsigns,  traffic  signal  control  at  major  urban  junctions,  street  lighting,  pedestrian\nfootways, fencing, and crossings.\n\nFacilities for pedestrians include hard shoulders and footways; kerbed footways in\nurban  areas;  pedestrian  crossings  at  each  urban,  semiurban,  village,  and\nsettlement  area;  pedestrian  crossings  and  fencing  at  bus  stops;  footways  and\nparking  areas  at  market  areas;  footways  and  pedestrian  fencing  at  major  road\njunctions; and street lighting at major urban areas.\n\nDesign  features  for  vehicles  and  vehicle  users  include  road  marking  throughout\nthe Project; traffic signs, including mandatory speed restrictions; safety guardrails\non  high  embankments;  hard  shoulders  to  segregate  traffic  and  accommodate\nbroken-down vehicles; speed humps at approaches to urban areas; street lighting\nat  major  urban  junctions;  roadside  parking  areas  at  bus  stops,  market  areas,\ndhabas,  repair  centers,  etc.;  junction  layouts  will  be  improved;  and  traffic  signal\ncontrols or roundabouts will be constructed at major urban intersections.\n\n5.\n\nRoad Safety Measures.

Moreover,  most \nto  highway\nimprovements  can  be  mitigated  through  engineering  designs,  and  good  construction\npractices, accompanied by appropriate environmental mitigation measures and management\nplans.  The  potential  impacts  due  to  improvement  of  the  Project  roads  are  described\nhereunder along with the mitigation measures.\n\nimpacts  arising  due \n\n1. \n\nGeology/Stone Quarries\n\n2.\nPotential  Impacts.  The  entire  national  highways  (NH)  and  state  highways  (SH)\nsections are in the deltaic plains with very little potential for stone quarrying operations. The\nstone-bearing areas are located at distances ranging between 15 to 120 kilometers (km) or\neven  beyond  the  adjoining  Birbhum  and  Santhal  Parganas  districts,  implying  that  both\nexisting  roads  as  well  as  dedicated  new  haul  roads  will  be  required  for  aggregate  hauling\noperations.  Quarrying  and  hauling  of  such  large  quantities  of  aggregates  will  lead  to  an\nincrease  in dust and noise levels, increased vehicular emissions along the haul roads, and\npossible negligence to safety and health of the workforce.\n\nImpact Mitigation. Mitigation measures have been defined to minimize the impacts\n3.\nduring quarry operations and upgrading of existing roads or constructing new dedicated haul\nroads  and  hauling  operations.  These  cover  dust  suppression  measures  along  haul  roads,\nemission  control  procedures  for  haul  trucks/dumpers,  compliance  with  local  environmental\nregulations, and occupational and safety controls.\n\n2. \n\nSoil/Borrow Areas\n\nPotential  Impacts.  The  improvement  works  will  involve  widening  the  carriageway\n4.\nand  shoulders  along  the  existing  alignment  and  raising  the  existing  embankment  of  the\nhighway  sections  at  certain  stretches  that  are  routinely  flooded/waterlogged  and  therefore\nrequire  large  quantities  of  earth.  The  project  region  presents  three  options  for  meeting  the\nearthwork requirements. The first option is excavation of the drainage channel/river beds1 of\nthe  region.  Due  to  the  deltaic  conditions  and  inherent  in  adequate  natural  drainage\nconstrictions, significant siltation has occurred in the channels and rivers of the region. Being\nin the deltaic region, the silt could well serve as embankment/road construction material.\n\n5.\nThe second option is use of fly ash from the Farakka Super Thermal Power Plant (km\n297-298).  Consultations  with  the  fly  ash  division  authorities  of  the  Farakka  Thermal  Power\nPlant has revealed that the thermal power plant has huge reserves and ash could be sourced\nfrom their Nishindra and Malancha ash pond areas. The Ministry of Environment and Forest\nhas issued a notification for regulating the use of fly ash in and around any thermal plant. As\nper the notification, fly ash/bottom ash/pond ash must be used in construction activity at least\nup to 25% within a 50-km radius of any coal-based thermal power plant. The use of fly ash\nfor  road  construction  has  been  well  recognized  and  already  implemented2  in  India.  The\n\n                                                          \n1 The option has been well received by the Directorate of Irrigation and Waterways, Government of West Bengal\n\nduring the consultations as a part of the initial environmental assessment.\n\n2 Fly ash has been successfully used in the construction of approach road embankments in a flood-prone/water\nlogged-areas  for  Nizamuddin  Bridge  across  River  Yamuna;  reinforced  fly  ash  (using  polymer  materials)  was\n\n\f44\n\nAppendix 9, page 2\n\nIndian  Roads  Congress  is  publishing  guidelines  for  use  of  fly  ash  in  embankment\nconstruction for highways in India.\n\nThe  third  option  is  to  use  agricultural  lands  either  alongside  or  from  interior  lands\n6.\nwithin  an  economical  distance  from  the  highway.  At  present  the  local  farmers  lease  their\nagricultural fields for excavation of earth generally up to 1.25 meters below the ground level\nmainly  for  short-term  economic  gains.  Given  the  landholding  pattern  and  land  forms\nregulations  in  West  Bengal,  availability  of  large  chunks  of  lands  is  very  unlikely.  Even  if\nnegotiated  with willing owners,  land may be available in innumerable places. Excavation of\nsuch a huge extent of agricultural lands at numerous places will make the hauling operations\ndifficult, nonfeasible, and environmentally unsustainable. Therefore, the first two options are\nto be preferably explored for NH 34 improvement, while the second and third option for state\nhgihway improvement.\n\nImpact Mitigation. Mitigation measures have been defined to minimize the impacts\n\n7.\nduring borrowing in river/channel beds and other material sourcing options.\n\n3. \n\nHydrogeology/Ground Water\n\nPotential \n\nImpacts.  Although, \n\nthe  region  does  have  surface  water  bodies,\n8.\ngroundwater  is  the  most  often  and  easily  accessed  source.  An  assessment  of  the\nconstruction  water  demand  and  the  available/recommended  groundwater  yield/potential3  of\nthe project region indicates that use of groundwater for the highway improvement works will\nnot have any significant impacts on the groundwater resources of the region.\n\n9.\nImpact  Mitigation.  Precautionary  measures  for  selection/construction  of  new\ntube/bore wells are defined in the Environmental Mitigation Action Plan. The tube/bore wells\nare to be left in good working condition after the completion of the works for the use of the\nlocal community. The groundwater, if used for human consumption in the workforce camps,\nwill be supplied from deep tube wells (100 meters and beyond) to prevent arsenic4 ingestion\nby the workforce. If unavoidable, the water used for human consumption will be treated for\narsenic using activated alumina as adsorbent or any other suitable method.\n\n4.\n\nWater Quality\n\nPotential  Impacts.  During  the  construction/rehabilitation  of  the  bridges/cross\n10.\ndrainage  structures,  discharge  of  construction  effluent  directly  into  the  watercourses  may\nimpact  its  quality.  Liquid  and  solid  waste  discharges  from  petroleum,  oil,  and  lubricants\nworkforce camps, and all other operational areas may impact upon the water quality of the\nreceiving water body if disposed of directly.\n\n11.\nImpact  Mitigation.  The  impacts  on  water  quality  during  the  rehabilitation  of  the\ncrossdrainage  structures  can  be  minimized  by  scheduling  the  construction  works  for\nnonmonsoon  months  to  the  extent  possible.  For  structures  across  the  major  water  bodies,\nappropriate  mitigation  measures  to  prevent  and/or  minimize  the  impacts  on  water  quality\nhave been defined. In any case, these impacts will be limited to the construction stage and\n\n                                                            \n\n   \nused for embankment construction of Sarita Vihar flyover, Delhi under the design and construction supervision\nof Central Road Research Institute, Mathura Road, New Delhi\n\n3 Recommended  yield  and  groundwater  potential  of  the  project  region  has  been  assessed  from  the  region-\n\nspecific study reports prepared by the Central Ground Water Board, Government of India\n\n4 Consultation  of  the  study  reports  prepared  by  the  Central  Ground  Water  Board  indicate  that  arsenic\n\ncontamination of groundwater occurs up to 80 meters below ground level.\n\n\f45\n\nAppendix 9, page 3\n\nare transitory in nature. Measures for workforce camps and operational areas like petroleum,\noil, and lubricants storage areas/hot mix plant areas have also been defined.\n\n5. \n\nTerrestrial Flora & Fauna\n\n12.\nPotential Impacts. The vegetative cover/trees within the COI will have to be cleared\nto make way for improvement works. The tree enumeration survey has indicated that NH 34\nhas  some  185  trees  per  km,  whereas  SH  10  and  SH  1  have  110  and  97  trees  per  km\nrespectively  within  the  COI.  The  actual  number  of  trees  to  be  felled  due  to  highway\nimprovement works will be far less and has to be determined after finalizing the engineering\ndesigns and alignment marking on-site. Most of these trees do not have significant ecological\nand/or  commercial  value  but  provide  a  serene  landscape  to  the  road  users.  The  trees  also\nserve  as  a  nesting  place  for  the  tree-dwelling  avian  fauna.  Therefore  clearing  of  trees  will\nhave a visible impact on road users and also temporarily upon the tree-dwelling fauna.\n\nImpact  Mitigation.  The  impacts  due  to  tree-clearing  operations  can  be  gradually\n13.\nretrieved by replanting. New saplings are to be planted (at the rate of five saplings for every\ntree  felled)  as  per  the  stipulation  of  the  Directorate  of  Forests,  Government  of  West\nBengal.(GWB) The replantation program is to be scheduled to commence prior to completion\nof construction works so that green cover is retrieved as early as possible.\n\n6. \n\nAir Quality\n\nPotential Impacts. The highway improvements are expected to provide higher speed\n14.\nfor  through  traffic,  and    reduce  congestion  in  urban  stretches/level  crossings  and  service\nareas  at  required  intervals  for  highway  users.  Therefore  the  current  pattern  of  slowing\ndown/stopping vehicles near urban/congested stretches will be significantly reduced and the\nmovement of through traffic will be relatively unhindered. This will have beneficial impact in\nterms  of  improved  air  quality  along  roadsides  as  compared  with  the  present  situation.  The\nforecasted  air  quality  concentrations  using  CALINE-4  model5  and  air  quality  model  of\nTransport  Road  Research  Laboratory  of  United  Kingdom  show  that  in  all  the  scenarios  the\nair quality levels are within the National Ambient Air Quality Standards except for suspended\nparticulate matter. The models considered traffic forecasts up to 2025 for NH 34, SH 10 and\nSH 1 and the vehicle emission factors recommended by the Indian Institute of Petroleum.\n\nImpact Mitigation. Impacts on air quality and noise during the construction stage are\n15.\ntransitory  and  can  be  largely  mitigated  by  exercising  control  measures.  The  measures  are\ndetailed in the Environmental Mitigation Action Plan (EMAP).\n\n7. \n\nConstruction Debris\n\n16.\nPotential  Impacts.  The  debris  from  dismantling  existing  pavement,  bridges  and\ndrainage  structures,  excavation  and  embankment  construction,  demolition  of  buildings,  and\nsite clearing operations need to be safely handled to minimize impacts.\n\n17.\nImpact Mitigation. The construction debris is to be recycled into new works subject\nto  meeting  the  specifications  and  prior  approval  of  the  Implementing  Agency.  However,\nrecyclying  the  entire  volume  of  the  dismantled  material  may  not  be  possible.  Therefore,\nsurplus debris needs to be safely disposed. Broad parameters for safe disposal of debris are\ndefined in the EMAP.\n\n                                                          \n5 CALINE4 was developed by the California Institute for Transportation, United States.\n\n\f46\n\nAppendix 9, page 4\n\n8. \n\nArchaeological and Historical Monuments\n\nPotential Impacts. There are no protected or declared archaeological or historically\n\n18.\nimportant monuments along the project sections of NH 34 and SH.\n\n9. \n\nShrines, Idols, and Statues\n\nPotential  Impacts:  Statues  of  political  and  spiritual  leaders,  roadside  shrines,  and\n19.\nsmall  temples  and  other  religious  structures  within  the  right-of-way  are  to  be  suitably\nrelocated to adjoining places along the improved highway sections.\n\nImpact  Mitigation.  The  relocation  of  such  structures  to  adjoining  places  is  to  be\n20.\ncarried  out  in  consultation6  with  the  local  community.  Broad  parameters  for  relocation  of\nstructures are included in the EMAP.\n\n10. \n\nSensitive and/or Critical Natural Habitats\n\n21.\nThe  Bethuadahari  Wildlife  Santuary  is  the  only  critical  natural  habitat  in  the  project\nregion.    The  wildlife  inhabiting  the  sanctuary  are  not  sensitive  to  traffic  noise,  and  vehicle\nemissions. In addition, the project highway will not encroach or pass through the sanctuary\nand thus will not result in any potential impacts on its environment and functions.\n\nB.\n\nEnvironmental Mitigation Action Plan\n\n22.\nThe  EMAP  was  prepared  for  the  construction  and  operation  stages  of  the  highway\nimprovement  works.  The  initial  environmental  assessment  report  along  with  EMAP  is  to  be\nappended to the construction contracts for implementation.\n\n23.\nThe broad cost estimate for implementation of the EMAP for the NH 34, SH 10 and\nSH 1 improvement is about $2.83 million, (does not include cost of constructing haul roads),\nwhich works out to 1.05 percent of the investment cost. Adequate funds have been provided\nin the project costs for this purpose.\n\nC.\n\nInstitutional Requirements\n\nThe  institutional  requirements  for  implementation  of  the  EMAP  during  construction\n24.\nand  operation  stages  have  been  framed.  The  project  Implementation  Agency,  the  Public\nWorks Department Roads will create a project environmental implementation unit (PEIU) for\nthe environmental management and monitoring of all the construction packages. The PEIU\nwill be headed by a senior environmental officer, designated as PEIU manager, who will be\nassisted by four environmental officers (one per package). The officers will be responsible for\nindependent monitoring of EMAP implementation under the directions of the PEIU manager.\n\nD.\n\nFindings\n\n25.\n\nThe major findings of the study include the following:\n\n(i) \n\nThe highway improvement works are largely confined to the available right-of-\nway. The marginal land acquisition if any will be restricted to urban stretches,\n\n                                                          \n6 The Social Impact Assessment Report provides details on the consultations with the local community leaders.\n\n\f47\n\nAppendix 9, page 5\n\nrail  overpasses  locations  and  improvement  of  the  junctions.  Even  in  such\ncase(s), the fresh land acquisition will be limited to 20 m.\nThe  project  road  sections  do  not  traverse  reserve  forests,  forest  areas,  and\nsensitive  natural  habitats;  and  has  no  historical  or  archeologically  important\nmonuments and heritage sites.\nThe  highway  improvement  present  two  environmentally/socially  beneficial\noptions for sourcing the earth for construction works. First is the excavation of\nthe silted drainage channel and river beds of the region; the second is the use\nof fly ash for embankment and other construction works.\nThe highway improvement works will involve clearing of large number of trees\nwithin  the  right-of-way.  As  per  the  stipulations  of  GWB,  prior  permission  for\ntree  felling  must  be  obtained  from  the  Directorate  of  Forests,  GWB;  five\nsaplings  are  to  be  planted  for  every  tree  felled  and  maintained  for  at  least\nthree years as a compensatory measure.\nEnvironmental  mitigation  measures  have  been  identified  for  other  project\nactions,  which  are  likely  to  induce  impacts.  A  control  matrix  showing\nresponsibilities  and  monitoring  frequency  of  mitigation  measures  has  been\ndefined. The EMAP is to be appended to the construction contracts.\nPEIU  will  implement  the  EMAP.  The  environmental  officers  of  PEIU  will\nmanage and oversee the implementation of the EMAP by the contractors.\n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nE.\n\nConclusion\n\n26.\nBased  on  the  initial  environmental  examination  conducted  and  with  the  mitigation\nmeasures  proposed  in  the  EMAP,  a  full-scale  environmental  impact  assessment  for  the\nProject is not required.\n\n\f48\n\nAppendix 10, page 1\n\nSUMMARY RESETTLEMENT PLAN\n\nA.\n\nThe Project\n\n1.\nThe  West  Bengal  Corridor  Development  Project  consists  of  (i)  widening  and\nimproving about 370 kilometers (km) of the National Highway 34 (NH 34); (ii) upgrading\nand  improving 150  km of  state  highways (SH 1 and SH 10); and (iii) rehabilitating 100\nkm of rural access roads. This Resettlement Plan (RP) presents relevant data related to\nthe  project  impacts;  and  outlines  the  remedial  measures,  and  how  and  when  these\nmeasures  must  be  implemented.  The  Ministry  of  Road  Transport  and  Highways,\nGovernment of India, will be the Executing Agency for the national highway component\nof  the  Project,  and  the  West  Bengal  Public  Works  Road  Department  (PWRD)  for  the\nstate  highway  and  rural  access  components.  The  Project  will  be  implemented  by  a\nproject implementation unit (PIU) within the West Bengal PWRD.\n\nB.\n\nScope of Impacts and Identification of People Affected\n\n2.\nAs  the  Government  already  owns  the  right-of-way  (ROW)  required  for  the\nimprovement  works  of  NH  34,  state  highways,  and  rural  access  roads,  fresh  land\nacquisition  will  be  minimal  except  for  minor  adjustments  and  straightening  of  the\nalignments  and  bypasses  for  SH  1  and  SH  10.  Despite  limited  land  acquisition,  the\nimprovement activities will affect roadside communities such as small shops/businesses\ncharacterized  by  ribbon  development  on  both  sides  of  the  existing  highways.  These\ninformal  dwellers/squatters  and\nsmall  business  enterprises  (SBEs)  are \nencroachers, who conduct various types of businesses on the ROW land and provide a\nrange of services linked to the roads and local economies. The SBEs are concentrated\naround  bus/truck  stops,  roadside  markets,  and  major  intersections,  where  traffic\ncongestion is already high. As a result, the proposed improvements will largely affect the\nroadside businesses and communities.\n\nlargely \n\n3.\nA  full  census  of  all  potentially  affected  SBEs  and  households  on  the  project\ncorridor of impact of NH 34 and SH 1 was conducted in February-March and May 2001.\nThe socioeconomic baseline data for SH 10 was collected in January-February 2000. In\nall, the project roads will likely affect 9,214 SBEs, 1,328 households, and 452 community\nproperties.  Also,  over  4000  SBEs  employees  will  be  affected  by  disruption  and\ntemporary  loss  of  employment.  The  census  team  assigned  identification  numbers  to\neach structure likely to be affected on both sides of project road sections (NH 34 and SH\n1). For SH 10, every structure on the corridor of impact was recorded on a plan-profile\ndrawing  with  identification  numbers.  Based  on  consultation  with  various  stakeholders\nand project social analysis, the project engineering team developed improved guidelines\nfor  alignment  design  to  minimize  displacement,  reduce  disruption  of  livelihoods,  and\nprovide  better  management  of  ROW  for  future  road  expansion  and  development.  The\ncensus inventory will be verified and updated based on the actual impact once the road\nalignments and designs are complete.\n\n\f49\n\nAppendix 10, page 2\n\nC.\n\nResettlement Principles and Entitlements\n\n4.\nThe  resettlement  principles  adopted  for  this  Project  recognize  the  Land\nAcquisition Act (Act I of 1894) and the Land Acquisition (West Bengal Amendment Act\n(West  Bengal  Act  XIX  of  1999).  They  also  comply  with  the  requirements  of  the  Asian\nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  policy  on  involuntary  resettlement.1  The  RP  will  provide\ncompensation  and  resettlement  assistance  to  all  affected  persons  and  businesses,\nincluding  the  informal  dwellers/squatters  in  the  project  corridor  of  impact.  In  general\nterms, the people affected by the Project will be entitled to four types of compensation\nand assistance: (i) compensation for loss of land and crops/trees, (ii) compensation for\nstructures (residential/commercial) and other immovable assets, (iii) assistance for loss\nincome,  and  (iv)  rebuilding  and/or  restoration  of  community\nof  business/wage \nresources/facilities.\n\nThe  affected  SBEs/households  may  be  entitled \n\n5.\nto  a  combination  of\ncompensation  measures  and  resettlement  assistance,  depending  on  the  nature  of\nownership rights of lost assets and scope of the impact, including social and economic\nvulnerability  of  the  people  affected.  The  RP  also  addresses  a  number  of  interrelated\nsociocultural  and  health  issues  that  could  accompany  the  road  widening  and\ndevelopment  \u2013  for  example,  road  safety,  trafficking  of  women,  and  children  and\nAIDS/HIV.  In  sum,  the  RP  takes  an  integrated  and  holistic  approach  to  dealing  with\nproject  impacts  and  aims  to  rebuild  lives  and  livelihoods  of  those  affected  by  using  an\ninnovative  ROW  management  and  development  approach.  It  is  designed  to  involve  all\nstakeholders, including roadside communities and other user groups, in project planning\nand implementation.\n\nD.\n\nParticipation, RP Implementation, and Budget\n\n6.\nPublic  response  to  the  Project  is  strong  and  positive  because  it  will  improve\ntransportation,  bring  new  opportunities  for  business,  and  significant  social  economic\nbenefits  to  the  local  communities.  Community  consultation  and  participation  played  a\nvery important role in selecting project options and improving designs for project roads.\nPIU  officials  will  step  up  information  campaigns  and  publish  brochures  on  the  project\nresettlement  principles  and  entitlements,  payments  procedures,  and  construction\nschedule  aimed  at  social  preparation  for  relocation  and  resettlement  of  the  affected\nSBEs/households.  The  PIU  will  hire  two  nongovernment  organization  to  help  with  the\ninformation  campaign  and  consultation  program,  road  safety,  trafficking,  and  AIDS/HIV\nawareness programs in the project area.\n\nThe RP will be implemented by the PWRD-PIU. The resettlement organization of\n7.\nthe  PIU  will  comprise  a  project  resettlement  officer  in  the  office  of  the  PIU  and\nresettlement officers for each contract packages. The project resettlement officer will be\nresponsible  for  the  day-to-day  activities  for  RP  implementation.  The  PIU  will  open  field\noffices for each civil contract packages, and engage adequate resettlement staff to carry\nout the designated activities of the RP. Resettlement advisory committees will be formed\nto seek inputs from stakeholders in RP decision making and implementation. Grievance\nredress committees will be formed in respective districts to resolve disputes concerning\n\n1 ADB. 1998. The Bank\u2019s Policy on Involuntary Resettlement. In Handbook on Resettlement.

Affected businesses and other\nvulnerable  groups,  such  as  women,  will  be  represented  in  those  committees  and  be\ninvolved  in  the  grievances  resolution  concerning  compensation  and  resettlement\nbenefits.\n\n8.\nResettlement  will  be  generally  completed  prior  to  award  of  the  civil  works\ncontracts. Where some physical construction like building of platforms, etc. is required,\nthe  work  will  be  integrated  with  the  civil  work  contract  as  provisional  sum  and  be  the\nresponsibility  of  the  civil  works  contractor  to  make  necessary  construction  as  may  be\nrequired for resettlement. A time-bound implementation schedule has been prepared in\naccordance  with  the  road  construction  schedule.  The  total  estimated  cost  for\nresettlement  operation  and  management  for  the  Project  is  Rs.618.5  million  ($13.35\nmillion). The Government of West Bengal will provide the entire fund for resettlement.\n\nE.\n\nMonitoring and Evaluation\n\n9.\nRP implementation will be supervised and monitored by the PIU in coordination\nwith  the  project  resettlement  officer  and  the  resettlement  advisory  and  grievances\nredress committees. The monitoring will be done both internally and externally. The PIU\nproject  director  will  prepare  monthly  reports  on  the  progress  of  RP  implementation.\nProject supervision consultants will monitor RP implementation and report on a quarterly\nbasis  to  PWRD  and  ADB  on  the  progress  of  resettlement  activities.    A  panel  of  local\nexperts,  who  will  be  engaged  by  PWRD,  will  conduct  independent  biannual  reviews  of\nresettlement  implementation,  and  provide  feedback  to  PWRD  and  ADB  on  the\neffectiveness of RP implementation.\n\n\f51\n\nAppendix 11, page 1\n\nECONOMIC EVALUATION\n\nA. \n\nIntroduction\n\nThe methodology used in the economic evaluation compared the with project situation to\n1.\nthat  of  the  without  project  situation  to  determine  the  effects  of  introducing  the  Project.  The\nProject involves rehabilitation of approximately 370 kilometers (km) of the Barasat-Dalkhola road\non  National  Highway  (NH)  34,  improvements  to  State  Highway  (SH)  1  between  Chakda  and\nBangaon (about 40 km), and improvements to SH 10 between Gazol and Hilli (about 110 km).\nThe Project roads pass through five districts: North 24-Parganas, Murshidabad, Nadia, Maldah,\nand  Uttar  Dinajpur.  The  major  towns  through  which  NH  34  passes  include  Barasat,\nKrishnanagar, Baharampur, Farakka, Maldah, and Raiganj. SH 1 and SH 10 connect with NH 34\nand link to the Bangladesh border. The rehabilitation and improvements to the existing NH 34 2-\nlane  road  consist  of  rehabilitating  the  pavement  and  widening  the  road  to  a  7  meter  (m)\npavement with 2.5 m shoulders. A 4-lane scenario was also considered as an alternative for the\nProject. After comparing these two mutually exclusive options, the 4-lane scenario was found to\nbe  not  economically  feasible.1  Therefore  the  2-lane  alternative,  the  least-cost  alternative,  was\nadopted for the Project.  For both  SH 1 and SH 10 the improvements are to widen the existing\nroads to 7 m with 1.5 m wide paved shoulders.\n\nB. \n\nTraffic Analysis and Projections\n\n1.\n\nExisting Traffic\n\nFor  analysis  purposes,  traffic  volumes  for  five  types  of  motorized  vehicles  were\n2.\ndeveloped.2 Traffic data was obtained for each of the project roads, namely NH 34, SH 1, and\nSH  10.  The  level  of  traffic  on  NH  34  was  determined  by  referring  to  recent  Public  Works\nDepartment  traffic  count  data.  This  was  compared  with  figures  in  other  studies  that  had  been\nrecently undertaken to check on the validity of the base information.3 Traffic surveys were also\nundertaken during project preparation.4 The traffic surveys comprised (i) three consecutive day\ntraffic counts at five locations for 24 hours per day, (ii) origin-destination surveys at two locations\nfor 24 hours at each site, and (iii) axle-load measurement at two locations for 24 hours at each\nlocation. The traffic count survey stations selected in the Technical Assistant (TA) were located\nas  closely  as  possible  to  the  survey  stations  used  in  the  previous  TA  to  enable  a  comparison\nwith  the  previous  counts.  The  traffic  count  survey  stations  were  located  at  Barasat  (km  33),\nKrishnanagar  (km  112),  Baharampur  (km  203),  Farakka  (km  302),  and  Gazol  (km  355).\nSeasonal  factors  were  applied  to  the  traffic  counts  obtained  from  the  surveys  and  base  year\ntraffic was obtained. Medium-size truck vehicles (2-axle rigid trucks) predominate in the annual\naverage daily traffic.

In  view  of  the  high  historical  growth  rates  and\nconsidering the probable future growth in population and economic activity, the future SGDP and\nDGSP  are  expected  to  be  high.  The  growth  rates  calculated  for  each  of  the  districts  through\nwhich the project road passes ranges from 5.5 percent to 6.2 percent per annum. These growth\nrates have been used over the study period.\n\nThe income elasticities derived in previous studies are used in the present analysis; they\n4.\nare different for both passenger and freight traffic. The elasticities were further split into car and\nbus  traffic  and  truck  traffic,  and  for  different  time  periods  throughout  the  study  period.  The  car\nand bus income elasticities range from 0.5 to 1.0, and the truck income range from 0.7 to 1.3.\nTransport  elasticity\u2019s  were  calculated  by  different  regions,  which  were  comprised  of  different\ndistricts. Estimates were also made of the change in elasticity over time based on the future growth\nprospects of West Bengal and also on the observations that were made for each region on such\nissues as existing level of traffic flows, future prospects of economic growth, and regional disparities\nin economic development.\n\n5.\nThe  growth  rate  in  DGDP  has  been  used  in  conjunction  with  the  income  elasticity  of\ndemand  to  derive  the  future  growth  in  traffic.  The  growth  rates  obtained  by  region  and  by  the\ndistricts within a region are shown in Table A11.2.\n\n6.\nThe growth rates in Table A11.2 are then applied to each of the sections of the project\nroad traffic estimates (Table A11.1) depending on which region and district the road section lies\nin.

NH  34  is  the  major  road  link  to  Nepal  and\nBhutan.  SH  1  and  SH  10  connect  NH  34  to  the  Bangladesh  border.  The  upgrading  and\nrehabilitation of these three roads, which constitute the Project, is expected to promote increased\ntrade within the subregion. The improvement of these linkages, NH 34, SH 1, and SH 10, is an\nimportant first step to increasing international trade and subregional cooperation.  Approximately\n70  to  80  percent  of  India\u2019s  exports  to  Bangladesh  take  place  through  the  border  towns  of\n\n\f55\n\nAppendix 11, page 5\n\nPetrapole  (SH  1),  Hilli  (SH  10),  and  Changrabandah,  with  Petrapole  being  the  principal  route.\nCongestion on both SH 1 and SH 10 occurs due to the narrow road width, which is restricting the\nflow  of  international  traffic.  For  international  traffic  between  India  and  Bangladesh  to  increase,\nthese routes need to be improved and widened to improve traffic flow.\n\n9.\nA true measure of the intraregional trade is hampered by unreliable data and unrecorded\ncross-border  trade.  However,  certain  points  can  be  noted.  First,  the  share  of  intra-South  Asian\nGrowth Quadrangle trade in total trade has increased modestly from 1.3 percent in 1985 to 2.8\npercent in 1995. In value terms, intraregional trade was approximately $506 million in 1985 and\n$2,451 in 1995. Secondly, the share of trade of each country in intraregional exports and imports\nvaries  significantly  across  countries.  While  in  1995,  Bangladesh  and  Nepal  met  15  and  33\npercent  of  their  import  requirements  from  the  region,  India  met  only  0.2  percent.  The  trend  is\nopposite  as  far  as  exports  are  concerned.  Bangladesh\u2019s  share  of  exports  to  the  region  has\ndecreased from 3.5 percent in 1985 to 1.4 percent in 1995, while that of India has increased from\n2.2  percent  to  3.5  percent.  Nepal\u2019s  export  to  India  have  increased  significantly  in  recent  years\nand in 1995 was 18.0 percent compared with 12 percent in 1990. In 2000, imports from India into\nNepal were of the magnitude of 38 percent and exports approximately 44 percent. In 1999 the\nvolume of freight traffic moving from India to Bangladesh on the Benapole (SH 1 border point) to\nDhaka is estimated at 891,000 metric tons and the traffic from Hilli (SH 10 border point) to Dhaka\nat 614,000 tons.\n\n10.\nFor  trade  to  increase  several  important  factors  are  necessary.  Effective  infrastructure\nlinks must offer convenient access to markets, and be supported by rational transport and transit\nprocedures  across  borders,  and  progressive  trade  facilitation  policies.  The  present  Project\nthrough its improvements to NH 34, SH 1 and SH 10 would alleviate the bottleneck that exists on\nthis  route,  lower  transport  costs,  and  stimulate  higher  volumes  of  freight  movement  to  other\ncountries in the subregion.\n\nC. \n\nEconomic Evaluation\n\n1.\n\nGeneral\n\nThe economic analysis of the Project, comprising NH 34 between Barasat and Raiganj,\n11.\nSH 1 between Chakda and Bangaon, and SH 10 between Gazol and Hilli compared scenarios\nwith  and  without  the  Project.  Without  the  Project,  traffic  would  experience  high  transport  costs\ndue to deteriorating road conditions and worsening traffic congestion. With the Project, transport\ncosts would be lower because the Project would improve road conditions.\n\n12.\nThe  economic  analysis  considered  the  estimated  benefits  and  costs  of  the  Project  over\n20 years of operation after the completion of civil works. Project benefits and costs were valued\nin 2001 constant prices. Benefits and costs in financial prices were adjusted to economic prices\nby deducting taxes and duties, and applying a standard conversion factor of 0.80 to nontraded\nlocal currency costs.\n\n2.\n\nCosts\n\n13.\nThe economic costs of implementing the Project were based on the financial costs of civil\nworks,  physical  contingencies,  land  acquisition  and  resettlement,  and  construction  supervision;\nexcluding  price  contingencies  and  interest  during  construction.  Incremental  operation  and\nmaintenance costs were calculated as the difference in O&M requirements with and without the\nProject. In the without\u2013project scenario, the road is assumed to receive routine maintenance and\n\n\f56\n\nAppendix 11, page 6\n\nan  overlay  every  5  years  as  this  is  the  current  practice.  This  overlay  has  a  low  strength\ncoefficient  and  therefore  necessitates  the  frequent  overlay  periods.  The  with-project  scenario\nincludes  routine  maintenance  and  an  overlay  to  international  standards  after  10  years  of\noperation in 2015. No residual value was considered at the end of the project life. For SH 1 and\nSH 10 the existing maintenance practice is to reseal the pavement every 5 years and to overlay\nthe pavement after 10 years. This has been adopted as the without-project scenario for both SH\n1 and SH 10. The with-project scenario for both SH 1 and SH 10 includes routine maintenance\nand an overlay every 10 years of operation. As with NH 34, no residual value was considered at\nthe end of the project road life.\n\n3.\n\nBenefits\n\nDue to the improved road surface, the Project would realize benefits in the reduction of\n14.\nvehicle operating costs (VOC), which VOC were calculated with and without the Project for each\nyear  of  the  analysis  period  for  traffic  in  the  five  vehicle  categories.  VOCs  are  influenced  by\nvehicle speed, the horizontal and vertical alignment of the road, and the physical condition of the\nroad surface,6 in addition to vehicle type, price, age, and load. The VOCs were calculated using\nthe  HDM III model.7 Local information was provided as much as possible to obtain results that\nare specific to India. The input data was based on 2001 prices and is net of taxes, duties, and\nother charges. The output of the model includes physical quantities of consumption and speed,\nand  the  associated  VOC  per  predefined  unit  of  1,000  vehicle-km.  VOC  estimates  for  the  five\nvehicles types and international road roughness index (IRI) values are shown in Table A11.4.\n\n15.\nUsing the economic VOC for different road roughness standards, annual VOC with and\nwithout  the  project  road  were  estimated  on  the  basis  of  the  pavement  roughness  deterioration\nestimated in terms of the IRI, taking into account the impact of periodic maintenance for each of\nthe project roads, namely NH 34, SH 1, and SH 10. The pavement deterioration for the with and\nwithout  Project  are  calculated  in  the  HDM  model.  The  deterioration  for  the  with  and  without\nscenario is shown in Table A11.5 for NH 34, SH 1, and SH 10.\n\n                  \n\n6 As measured by the international road roughness index (IRI) in meters per kilometer.\n7 The Highway Design and Maintenance (HDM) model was developed by the World Bank and is used worldwide as\n\nbest practice.\n\n\f57\n\nAppendix 11, page 7\n\nTable A11.4: Economic Vehicle Operating Costs\n(Rs per vehicle km)\n\nRoughness\n(IRI) a\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n\nCar Bus\n\n6.5\n6.6\n6.7\n6.8\n7.0\n7.1\n7.3\n7.7\n7.9\n\n11.8\n11.9\n12.1\n12.3\n12.5\n12.7\n12.9\n13.1\n13.3\n\nLight\nTruck\n8.2\n8.4\n8.6\n8.8\n9.2\n9.5\n9.8\n10.5\n10.8\n\nMedium\nTruck\n15.3\n15.8\n16.4\n16.9\n17.7\n18.3\n18.9\n20.0\n20.6\n\nHeavy\nTruck\n16.7\n17.2\n17.9\n18.3\n19.2\n19.8\n20.4\n21.5\n22.0\n\nIRI = international road roughness index.\na  minutes/kilomer.\nSource: Feasibility study.\n\nTable A11.5: Pavement Roughness Deterioration\n\nWithout Project\nSH 1\nand\nSH 10\n6.8\n5.7\n6.0\n6.4\n6.9\n7.5\n8.5\n8.3\n8.9\n9.5\n10.0\n10.0\n5.3\n5.7\n6.1\n6.5\n7.1\n7.7\n8.4\n8.3\n9.0\n9.7\n10.0\n10.0\n10.0\n\nNH 34\n6.5\n5.5\n6.1\n6.7\n7.4\n5.0\n5.6\n6.3\n7\n7.8\n5.0\n5.7\n6.5\n7.4\n8.4\n5.0\n5.9\n6.9\n8\n9.3\n5.0\n6.2\n7.4\n8.9\n10.4\n\nYear\n2001\n2002\n2003\n2004\n2005\n2006\n2007\n2008\n2009\n2010\n2011\n2012\n2013\n2014\n2015\n2016\n2017\n2018\n2019\n2020\n2021\n2022\n2023\n2024\n2025\n\nWith Project\n\nSH 1\nand\nSH 10\n\nNH 34\n\n2.2\n2.6\n2.9\n3.1\n3.4\n3.8\n4.3\n4.9\n5.5\n2.2\n2.4\n2.6\n2.8\n3.1\n3.4\n3.7\n4.1\n4.7\n5.4\n6.3\n\n2.4\n2.5\n2.6\n2.7\n2.9\n3.0\n3.3\n3.6\n4.0\n4.5\n2.3\n2.4\n2.5\n2.7\n2.9\n3.1\n3.3\n3.7\n4.2\n4.8\n\nNH = National Highway, SH = State Highway.\nSource: Feasibility study.\n\n\f58\n\nAppendix 11, page 8\n\n16.\nTime savings have not been evaluated in the analysis, as in economic theory the savings\nin  time  that  take  place  would  have  to  be  put  to  another  productive  use  so  that  they  can  be\nincluded  in  the  evaluation.  However,  an  estimate  has  been  made  of  the  reduction  in  time  that\nwould take place after the introduction of the project road. The change in average speeds in the\nwithout-project case to the with-project case trip times are estimated to fall by 30-40 percent. The\ncalculated  trip  time  from  Barasat  to  Raiganj  on  NH  34  at  the  present  time  is  approximately  12\nhours (average speed 30 km/hour [kph]). After the project is introduced, the average speed will\nincrease to 50 kph and the trip time will be about 7 hours.\n\n4.\n\nEconomic Internal Rate of Return\n\nThe economic evaluation of the Project compared the benefits and costs for the with-and\n17.\nwithout-  project  scenarios.  The  project  capital  costs  are  assumed  to  be  incurred  in  2001-2005,\nand that the project benefits to start in 2006 and be available for 20 years to 2025. The benefits\nare  based  on  VOC  savings,  in  economic  prices.  These  benefits  were  compared  with  the  road\nimprovement and maintenance costs to calculate the economic internal rate of return (EIRR). All\nbenefits and costs were estimated net of duties and taxes, and are expressed in constant 2001\nprices.  The  EIRR  was  estimated  for  three  contract  packages  for  NH  34,  namely  package  A\n(Barasat-Baharampur, km 31-km 193), package B (Baharampur-Farakka, km 193-km 297), and\npackage C (Farakka-Raiganj, km 297-km 398) and for the project road as a whole. The EIRR for\nthe individual contract packages ranged from 18.8 to 25.2 percent, and the EIRR for the whole of\nNH 34 was 23.1 percent. The EIRR for SH 10 from Gazol to Hili (package D) was estimated at\n16.6 percent and SH 1 from Chakda to Bangaon (package E) was calculated as 15.7 percent. A\nsummary  of  the  results  of  the  economic  evaluations  is  shown  in  Table  A11.6.  The  benefit  and\ncost  stream  for  NH  34  as  a  whole  are  shown  in  Table  A11.  7,8  and  for  SH  10  and  SH  1  are\nshown in Table A11.8 and Table A11.9.

This was undertaken for each section of each of the project roads and for the Project\nas  a  whole.  The  results  of  this  analysis  are  shown  in  Table  A11.11.  The  sensitivity  analysis\nshows the effects of increases in capital costs by 20 percent, a fall in the level of benefits of 20\npercent, an implementation delay of 2 years, and a combination of an increase in capital costs\nand a fall in economic benefits. The scenario of an increase in capital costs of 20 percent and a\nfall in  the level  of benefits  by  20  percent reduces the EIRR for the overall Project from 21.3 to\n\n\f14.9 percent. The switching value9 for costs was determined to be 87 percent, and the switching\nvalue for benefits was 47 percent.\n\n63\n\nAppendix 11, page 13\n\nTable A11.11: EIRR Sensitivity Analysis\n\nBase\nCase\n\n+ 20%\nCosts\n(1)\n\n- 20%\nBenefits\n(2)\n\nCombination\n(1 + 2)\n\nImplementation\nDelay by 2\nyears\n\nRoad Section\n\nNational Highway 34\nA. km 31 \u2013 km 193\nB. km 193 \u2013 km 297\nC. km 297 \u2013 km 398\nSubtotal\n\n25.2\n24.2\n18.8\n23.1\n\n21.4\n20.6\n15.6\n19.5\n\n21.0\n20.1\n15.2\n19.1\n\n14.0\n\n13.2\n\n17.6\n16.9\n12.3\n15.9\n\n12.0\n\n11.3\n\nD.State Highway 10 Gazol-Hili\n\n16.6\n\n14.4\n\nE.

The  direct\nbenefits  for  the  Project  as  a  whole  are  Rs5,587  million  in  PV  terms.  These  figures  simply\nrepresent  the  sum  of  the  PV  of  benefits  to  passengers,  freight  users,  vehicle  owners,  and  the\nGovernment. These are conservative estimates, because only direct benefits of the Project have\nbeen  considered.  The  distribution  analysis  has  been  based  upon  the  existing  situation  in  the\nroad transport industry, and an estimate of how this will develop in the future. At the time of the\nAppraisal Mission the freight transport industry was fully competitive in determining freight rates,\nbut  the  passenger  transport  industry  was  regulated  and  fares  are  set  by  the  state.  The\npassenger  transport  industry  is  expected  to  be  gradually  deregulated  in  the  future.  Freight\nowners and operators presently pass on part of the savings they receive through lower vehicle\noperating costs to freight users. Bus owners and operators will pass on more of the savings they\nreceive  through  reduced  vehicle  operating  costs  once  the  industry  is  fully  deregulated.  Table\nA11.12 shows the estimated benefits for each category of beneficiaries for NH 34, SH 10, SH 1,\nand for the Project as a whole.\n\n                  \n\n9 The switching value shows the percentage increase in a cost variable (or decline in a benefit variable) required for\nthe  net  present  value  (NPV)  to  become  zero,  which  is  the  same  as  the  EIRR  reducing  to  the  cutoff  level  of  12\npercent.\n\n\f64\n\nAppendix 11, page 14\n\nTable A11.12: Distribution of Net Benefits\n(Rs.

In terms of\nthe distribution of benefits in the project area, a recent study found that approximately 80 percent\nof all vehicles originated or were destined for the districts of the project area, the remaining traffic\noriginated or was destined for other parts of India or neighboring countries. Therefore 80 percent\nof  the  benefits  shown in Table  A11.12 are likely to accrue to the people in the project area. In\nterms of passenger benefits, which represents benefits to bus users, a large part of this benefit\nwill be passed to the poor in the project area as these are the people who use public transport.\nThe  benefits  to  freight  users  will  be  distributed  between  entrepreneurs  who  tend  to  purchase\nfreight services after they have bought in bulk the produce of several different farmers, and also\nbetween some of the rural poor who ship their own agricultural produce directly.  The largest part\nof  net  benefits  go  to  the  vehicle  owners  themselves.  Vehicle  owners  consist  of  car,  bus,  and\ntruck owners and operators.\n\n22.\nIndirect  benefits  will  include  the  increased  trade  and  economic  activity  that  are  partly\ninduced by the improved roads. The size of these indirect benefits depends on how the regional\nand national economies grow over the Project\u2019s time horizon. These indirect benefits will provide\nadditional  employment  opportunities,  which  will  impact  the  poor  and  therefore  increase  their\nincome  levels.  Additional  indirect  benefits  to  the  Project  will  be  obtained  through  the  Rural\nAccess  Roads  component  of the Project (Appendix 12). These rural access roads will improve\nfarm-to-market  access,  which  will  in  turn  lead  to  additional  economic  activity  in  agriculture  and\nagricultural-related industries.\n\n\f65\n\nAppendix 12, page 1\n\n`POVERTY REDUCTION IMPACT OF THE PROJECT\n\nA. \n\nIntroduction\n\nimpacts  on \n\nTransport  has  direct \n\nthe  personal  welfare  of  all \n\n1.\nincome  groups.\nImprovements  in  transport  not  only  provide  people  with  more  convenient  access  to  a  broad\nrange of socioeconomic opportunities, but also have strong income effects by lowering transport\ncost and hence the prices of consumer goods and services. In these ways, transport makes a\npervasive  contribution  to  improve  personal  welfare.  Understanding  the  transmission  of  these\nimpacts is especially important in assessing transport\u2019s direct contribution to poverty reduction.\nFor the poor, the lack of affordable access deprives them of the ability to take advantage of job\nopportunities  and  even  of  very  basic  social  services.  Reliable  access  to  schools  and  health\nservices for the poor contributes directly to their accumulation of human capital, which is a key\nfactor in sustainable poverty reduction.\n\nA  poverty  reduction  impact  study  was  carried  out  to  assess  the  poverty  reduction\n2.\nimpacts of the Project. The study was undertaken between January and March 2001, had the\nfollowing components:\n\n (i) \n\n (ii) \n\n (iii) \n\nConduct  poverty  mapping  of  the  affected  districts  based  on  existing  household\nand income data (including data from recent studies).\nIdentify  areas  of  highest  unemployment,  underemployment,  income  sources,\noccupations  of  the  people  living  closest  to  the  proposed  road,  proximity  of\nproposed junctions to communities.\nIdentify available link and access roads, and their proximity to poor populations,\nand  analyze  how  limitations  in  access  to  transportation  and  transportation\nservices contribute to poverty in the project hinterland.\n\n3.\nThe main findings of the study are that the Project will lead to an improved standard of\nliving, and reduced poverty and unemployment in its area of influence. This will be achieved by\nenhancing  household  mobility  and  expanding  economic  opportunities  in  the  project  area,\nparticularly in agriculture and small-scale industry.\n\nB. \n\nPoverty in the Project Area\n\n1.\n\nGeneral Context\n\n4.\nHuge  challenges  are  posed  by  India\u2019  s  low  per  capita  income,  $453  in  fiscal  year  (FY)\n2000,  and  a  population  of  about  1  billion.  Despite  some  progress,  access  to  basic  social\nservices  such  as  education  and  health,  remain  widespread.  While  the  proportion  of  the\npopulation  living  below  the  poverty  line  declined  from  50  percent  in  the  1970s  to  about  39\npercent  in  1987/88,  and  further  to  26  percent  by  2000,1  the  absolute  number  of  poor  doubled\nfrom 164 million in 1951 to 320 million by 1993-94 mainly due to the increase in population from\n600 million in the early 1970s to more than 950 million in the mid-1990s.\n\n                                                          \n1 Poverty incidence in India is measured as the percentage of the population living below a well-defined poverty line\n(based on a consumption level equivalent to a daily food intake of 2,100-2,400 calories in urban and rural areas\nData  on  household  expenditure  from  the  national  sample  surveys  (NSS),  was  used.  Full  NSS  rounds,  covering\nabout  100,000  households,  are  conducted  every  4-6  years,  most  recently  in  1999/2000.  \u201cThin  sample\u201d  surveys,\nwith substantially smaller sample size and reduced scope, are conducted annually.\n\n\f66\n\nAppendix 12, page 2\n\n2. \n\nProject Area\n\n5.\nThe project area covers five districts, namely, North 24-Parganas, Maldah, Murshidabad,\nNadia, and Uttar Dinajpur. The population of these districts is approximately 19.5 million, which\nis about 29 percent of the total population of West Bengal. Of the 19.5 million, approximately 76\npercent live in rural areas. The estimated district domestic product of the five districts in 1995/96\nat 1980/81 constant prices are as follows: North 24-Parganas, Rs19,381 million; Murshidabad,\nRs11903 million; Nadia, Rs9,587 million; Maldah, Rs5,840 million; and, Uttar Dinajpur, Rs3,901\nmillion. Per capita income varied between the districts, ranging from Rs1,776 in Uttar Dinajpur\nto Rs2,351 in North 24-Parganas.\n\nThe  poor  are  classified  as  those  whose  annual  (5-member)  family  income  lie  below\n6.\nRs15,000 per annum  as defined by the government of West Bengal. Recent estimates by  the\nNational Sample Survey Organization for 2000 show that approximately 27 percent of people in\nWest Bengal are poor, i.e., 1 percent higher than for India as a whole, 26 percent. From recent\ndata in West Bengal the following estimates of the number of poor in the districts through which\nthe project road passes are shown in Table A12.1.\n\nTable A12.1: Percentage of Population By District Below The Poverty Line\n\nDistrict\nNorth 24 Parganas\nNadia\nMurshidabad\nMaldah\nUttar Dinajpur\nSource:  Feasibility study.\n\n%\n32\n31\n31\n33\n32\n\n7.\nAmong the five districts, records show that the highest proportion of poor population is in\nMaldah,  33  percent,  followed  by  Uttar  Dinajpur  and  North  24  Parganas  at  32  per  cent,  and\nNadia and Murshidabad at 31 percent. Approximately one third of the population in each district\nare poor. This is approximately equivalent to 6.4 million people in all the project road districts.\n\n8.\nA  profile  of  the  project  area  was  conducted  by  undertaking  household  surveys\nthroughout  the  districts.  A  total  of  522  households  were  surveyed2  to  obtain  information  on\nemployment, unemployment, landholding, sources of income, educational status, and access to\ninfrastructure facilities.  The major findings from this profile show that unemployment is high in\neach  of  the  districts  and  averaged  65  percent  of  those  interviewed.  The  predominant\nemployment sector is agriculture. Income ranges varied between districts. In North 24-Parganas\n45  percent  of  those  surveyed  had  a  monthly  income  of  between  Rs500-1,000.  In  Nadia,  42\npercent  of  the  surveyed  people  had  the  same  income  range.  The  figures  were  similar  for  the\nother  districts.  The  income  data  collected  in  the  surveys  confirmed  the  high  levels  of  poor\npeople as shown in Table A12.1.\n\n                                                          \n2 The  household  interviews  were  undertaken  under  TA  3540-IND:  Economic and Poverty Analysis for the West\n\nBengal Corridor Development Project, for $150,000, approved on 13 November 2000.\n\n\f67\n\nAppendix 12, page 3\n\nC.\n\nSocial and Poverty Reduction Initiatives\n\n1.\n\nGovernment\n\n9.\nAs  poverty  reduction  is  a  major  challenge  faced  by  the  Government,  poverty  reduction\nprograms are central to the Government\u2019s intervention in development programs. The Ministry\nof  Rural  Development  has  been  acting  as  a  catalyst  to  effect  change  by  implementing  a  wide\nspectrum  of  programs  aimed  at  poverty  reduction,  employment  generation,  infrastructure\ndevelopment  and  social  security.  Over  the  years,  with  the  experience  gained  in  program\nimplementation and in response to the felt needs of the rural poor, the existing programs have\nbeen modified and new programs introduced. The Ninth Five-Year Plan strategy to reduce rural\npoverty  through  direct  intervention  is  based  on  the  experience  gained  in  the  earlier  plans  and\nconsists of a number of rural development programs.\n\n10.\n\nTwo of these programs are briefly described here.3\n\na.\n\nIntegrated Rural Development Program\n\nThe Integrated Rural Development Program (IRDP) started in 1980/81 and continued as\n11.\na  major  self-employment  scheme  in  the  Ninth  Five-Year  Plan  until  1  April  1999  when  it  was\nrestructured  and  merged  with  Swaranjayanti  Gram  Swarozgar  Yojana.  The  major  objective  of\nthe  IRDP  was  to  provide  self-employment  to  the  rural  poor  through  acquisition  of  productive\nassets  or  appropriate  skills  that  would  generate  additional  income  on  a  sustained  basis  to\nenable them to cross the poverty line. Identified rural families were expected to move above the\npoverty line by providing them with productive assets and inputs in the primary, secondary, or\ntertiary  sectors  through  financial  assistance  by  Government  subsidy  and  credit  from  financial\nInstitutions.\n\nb.\n\nDevelopment of Women and Children in Rural Areas\n\nDevelopment of Women and Children in Rural Areas (DWCRA) aimed to strengthen the\n12.\ngender  component  of  the  IRDP.  It  was  initially  launched  as  a  pilot  program  in  50  selected\ndistricts with United Nation\u2019s International Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF) cooperation to strengthen\nthe women\u2019s component of poverty reduction programs. The program was later extended to all\nthe districts of the country. The objective of the program was to raise the income level of women\nof  poor  households  to  enable  their  organized  participation  in  social  development  toward\neconomic  self-reliance.  Through  the  strategy  of  group  formation,  women\u2019s  access  to  basic\nservices  was  to  be  improved,  such  as  to  health,  education,  child  care,  nutrition,  water,  and\nsanitation.  During  the  Eighth  Five-Year  Plan,  the  program  benefited  about  2.3  million  women\nwho were assisted at an expenditure of Rs.1,910 million.\n\n2.\n\nWest Bengal\n\n13.\nRural development funding throughout West Bengal amounted to Rs 4,089 million in FY\n2000-2001.  Expenditure  in  previous  years  was  Rs3,663  million  in  FY1999/2000,  and  Rs2,780\nmillion  in  FY1998/99.  The  Public  Works  Department  is  undertaking  work  in  constructing  rural\n\n                                                          \n3 All of the Government poverty reduction programs are described more fully in TA 3540-IND: Economic and Poverty\n\nAnalysis for the West Bengal Corridor Development Project, Volume II \u2013 Poverty Analysis, April 2001.\n\n\f68\n\nAppendix 12, page 4\n\nroads  under  the  aegis  of  the  Rural  Development  Department.  A  road  program  has  been\nintroduced  to  link  all  villages  with  a  population  of  1,500  and  above,  and  50  percent  of  the\nvillages with a population between 1,000 to 1,500 over a 20-year period.4 Rural road schemes\npresently under construction are estimated to have a total project cost of Rs4,974 million ($108\nmillion). These roads total an approximate length of 2,317 km, and include 221 individual roads.\nOther  rural  infrastructure  is  also  being  undertaken  in  the  project  area,  and  includes  irrigation\nwork,  improvements  to  canals,  school  buildings,  sericulture  projects,  and  other  small-scale\nimprovements to rural infrastructure.\n\n14.\nIn the rural areas of six less developed districts of North Bengal, namely, Coochbehar,\nDakshin  Dinajpur,  Darjeeling,  Jalpaiguri,  Malda,  and  Uttar  Dinajpur  (the  project  road  passes\nthrough  two  of  these  districts)  special  provisions  have  been  made  for  implementing  schemes\nrelating  to  the  construction  and  improvement  of  roads,  bridges,  culverts,  embankments,\ndrainage  facilities,  sanitation,  and  other  infrastructure  facilities.  The  total  2000/01  plan\nexpenditure for the restoration and development of roads in these districts is Rs170 million. The\nschemes  under  this  program  are  implemented  by  the  Zilla  and  Mahakuma  parishads.  The\nfollowing are taken into account when devising each project:\n\n (i) \n\n(ii) \n \n\n(iii) \n \n\nThe entire outlay is spent on the rural people of North Bengal districts.\n\nEmployment  generation  is  the  main  objective  of  the  program,  and  labor\nintensive schemes are preferred.\n\nEnvironmental  needs  will  be  safeguarded  during  implementation  of  the\nschemes.\n\n15.\nBesides road programs in West Bengal, several other internationally funded projects in\ninfrastructure and social development are underway; several have direct impacts on the poverty\nreduction.  The  Netherlands  Government  has  instituted  projects  in  irrigation,  soil  conservation,\nand  soil  improvement  in  the  north  of  West  Bengal.  The  World  Bank  is  conducting  work  in  the\nagriculture  sector,  power  sector,  and  schemes  in  the  development  of  the  health  sector.  The\nUnited  States  Agency  for  International  Development  (USAID)  has  supported  programs  to\npromote  health  services,  and  food  aid  grants  for  the  poor.  The  United  Kingdom  is  helping  to\nreduce poverty; tackle environmental problems; and promote the economic, social, political and\nlegal  status  of  women  in  all  sectors.  Japan  attaches  high  significance  to  poverty  reduction\nprograms with a focus on medical care and health, agriculture, and rural development.\n\nD.\n\nRural Access Roads\n\nThe improvement of about 100 km of rural access roads under the Project will increase\n16.\nboth the economic way of life (income poverty) and the social way of life (human poverty) of the\npoor in the project area. Firstly, improving the rural access roads and enabling farmers to gain\naccess to markets more efficiently will probably increase the size of farmers\u2019 agricultural output.\nFor example, if it takes the farmer 1 hour to get to market by using an ox-cart with one load of\nagricultural  produce,  the  farmer  is  more  likely  to  use  motorized  transport  if  a  road  exists  and\ntransport agricultural produce in bulk, which will now take only 10 minutes. This increase in the\nfarmer\u2019s output generates additional income, which is spent on other goods and services within\nthe  project  area.  Secondly,  the  improvement  in  accessibility  to  the  agricultural  area  will  also\n\n                                                          \n4 In the Ninth FiveYear Plan, the target is to construct 300 kilomenter of road connecting 800 villages.\n\n\f69\n\nAppendix 12, page 5\n\nproduce ease of access to other facilities. For example the introduction of electricity supply into\nthe area will be easier due to the improved access road. Access to better water facilities may\nalso  occur,  as  may  improvements  in  communication  systems,  and  health  and  education\nfacilities.  Thirdly,  more  intensive  agricultural  production  methods  may  increase  due  to  the\nreduced cost of supply of agricultural inputs, e.g., fertilizer, etc.\n\nThe  selection  of  rural  access  roads  that  should  be  improved  will  be  based  on  several\n\n17.\ncriteria. These include\n\n (i) \n \n(ii) \n(iii) \n \n \n(iv) \n(v) \n \n\npopulation served by the rural access road,\nconnectivity to market centers,\nagricultural activity in the area,\nindustrial activity in the area, and\npercentage of population below the poverty line.5\n\nMost  of  the  existing  rural  access  roads  have  a  width  of  3.5  to  3.8  meters  and  are  in  a\n18.\nbad state of repair. During the monsoon season travel along these roads becomes difficult. The\nimprovements  under  the  Project  will  increase  the  width  of  these  roads  to  5\u20135.5  meters  and\nprovide paved shoulders of 1 meter.

People were asked\nwhat they thought the Project would do for the area and what their fears about the Project were.\nDuring the course of the household interviews, a community-based assessment was made by\nconducting  group  meetings  (separately  for  men  and  women)  to  determine  what  the  feelings\nwere toward the planned Project, and also to obtain information on what the participants thought\nmay be accomplished and the benefits that would be produced by the Project.\n\n20.\nIn  terms  of  the  household  and  the  focus  group  meetings,  the  major  responses  and\nvoluntary opinions highlighted several major items that people thought would be accomplished\nby  improving  the  project  road.  A  summary  of  the  main  findings  from  the  surveys  and  other\ndevelopment impacts of the Project are summarized in Table A12.3.\n\nTable A12.3: Summary of Development Impacts\n\nImpact\nAccess to markets\n\nRoad  construction  and  maintenance  employment\nopportunities\n\nAccess to educational facilities\n\nBenefits\nThe  main  cause  of  poverty  in  the  project  road  area,\nparticularly NH 34, is the lack of market accessibility for\nfarmers.  Better  roads  mean  more  reliable  and  cheaper\ntransportation of agricultural produce to markets, as well\nas  better  access  to  markets.  With  the  incorporation  of\nrural access roads in the Project, this will ensure a more\nreliable access to markets and will lead to an increase in\nproduction of agricultural produce.\n\nLocal  labor  in  the  rural  areas  will  be  able  to  increase\ntheir  income  during  the  road  construction  period  of  the\nProject  by  being  employed  as  unskilled  laborers.  This\nwill  reduce  both  income  poverty  and  human  poverty  by\nenabling  the  employed  laborers  to  purchase  additional\nconsumer  goods.  This  benefit  is  expected  to  produce\nbetween  4  to  5  million  person-days  of  work  during  the\nconstruction  period.  There  will  also  be  employment\nthe  construction\nopportunities \nprocess unskilled labor could be trained to follow on the\nproject  construction  phase  with  the  proper  maintenance\ntechniques. This is particularly relevant for rural roads.\n\nfor  women.a  During \n\nBetter access to educational facilities has the possibility\nof  reducing  illiteracy  in  the  project  area.  The  present\nilliteracy rate in the project area is 36 percent for males\nand  54  percent  for  females.  Improvements  of  access  to\nlearning  institutions  has  shown  in  other  studies  that  the\nrate of attendance has increased, which has directly lead\nto  a  reduction  in  the  rate  of  illiteracy.b  Currently,  the\naverage  student-teacher  ratio  in  the  villages  along  the\nproject road is around 150 to 1.\n\n\fImpact\n\nIncreased mobility\n\nImproved quality of life\n\nIncrease in employment opportunities\n\nGender\n\n72\n\nBenefits\n\nAppendix 12, page 8\n\nIncrease  in  mobility  enables  the  movement  of  people  in\nsearch  of  employment.  With \nthe  cheaper  cost  of\ntransport  the  movement  of  labor  in  search  of  seasonal\noccupations  during  periods  of  agricultural  slack  will\nimprove. The Project will facilitate labor mobility to other\nareas  in  search  of  work.  Moreover,  lack  of  affordable\naccess  deprives  the  poor  of  the  opportunity  to  take\nadvantage of jobs and even of very basic social services.\nReliable  access  to  schools  and  health  services  will\nenable the poor to accumulate human capital, which is a\nkey factor in sustainable poverty reduction.\n\nAn  improvement  in  the  standard  of  living  through\naccessibility  to  other  services  will  produce  a  fall  in  the\nlevel  of  human  poverty  in  the  project  area  and  improve\nthe quality of life. The improvement of the project roads\nwill  enable  the  poor  in  the  influence  area  of  the  road\ngreater  accessibility  to  other  infrastructure  services,  for\nexample, schools, hospitals, etc. An improvement in the\nProject roads will decrease this trip time and ensure that\nwhen medical facilities are required they can be reached\nefficiently.  Improvements  on  the  project  road  not  only\nprovide people with more convenient access to a broad\nrange of socioeconomic opportunities, but will also have\na  strong  income  effect  by  lowering  transport  costs  and\nhence  the  prices  of  consumer  goods  and  services.\nTherefore, it will contribute to improving personal welfare\nfor  the  rural  poor  found  in  the  districts  of  NH  34,  SH  1,\nand SH 10.\n\nThe increase in the demand for agricultural products and\nthe  expansion  of  the  service  sector  to  satisfy  this\ndemand  will  create  employment  within  the  transport\nsector for the rural poor. Due to the increase in demand\nfor agricultural products opportunities for work for drivers\ntransport  will\nof  both  motorized  and  nonmotorized \nincrease, and more labor will be required for loading and\nunloading  vehicles.  This  expansion  in  the  transport\nsector  will  necessitate  an  increase  in  businesses  that\nservice and repair transport vehicles, e.g., repair shops,\ngarages,  etc.,  which  will  also  provide  more  employment\nopportunities.\n\nWomen  use  nonmotorized  transport  considerably,  e.g.,\ncycle-rickshaws.  Due  to  the  project  improvements  and\nthe  widening  of  NH  34,  SH  1,  and  SH  10,  more  road\nspace  will  be  available  for  nonmotorized  transport;  this\nshould  lead  to  an  increase  in  the  usage  of  this  form  of\ntransport.  Leading  from  this,  the  accessibility  of  women\nto  better  health  facilities,  educational  facilities  for  their\nchildren, etc. will improve.\n\n\fImpact\n\nBenefits\n\nReduction in vehicle operating cost\n\n73\n\nAppendix 12, page 9\n\nA  large  part  of  the  traffic  on  the  road  is  freight  traffic\n(approximately 80 percent of all vehicles are trucks). The\nmain commodity carried is agricultural produce. A saving\nto  the  vehicle  operator  of  the  freight  company  through\nthe  reduction  in  vehicle  operation  cost  (VOC)  may  be\npassed on to the individual farmer or shipper in the form\nof lower freight rates. This will also reduce the cost of the\nproduct  as  its  transportation  charge  has  declined.  The\nrural access roads that lead to NH 34 are the areas that\nproduce  agricultural  products.  The \nin  VOC  of\nagricultural  product  movement  will  lead  the  farmer  to\nincrease production. In a similar way the VOC savings to\nbus companies may produce a fall in passenger fares.\n\nfall \n\na For example in Chad, women sold food and water to the labor force working on the road and increased their daily\n\nincome.\n\nb A  World  Bank  study  on  a  road  project  in  Morocco  revealed  that  a  major  impact  of  the  project  was  on  girls\u2019\nenrollment in primary education, which more than trebled in the project zones a few years after completion of the\nproject.\n\n\f", "author_pages": ["CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS\n(as of 1 November 2001)\n", "Currency Unit\n", "Rupee/s (Re/Rs)\n", "\u2013\n", "=\n=\n", "Re1.00\n$1.00\n", "$0.208\nRs47.98\n", "In this report, an exchange rate of $1.00 = Rs46 prevailing during appraisal is used.\n", "ADB\nCRF\nEIRR\nEMAP\nGWB\nJBIC\nkm\nMORTH\nNHAI \nNH\nPIU\nPWRD\nRP\nROW\nSH\nSTC\nSTD\nTA\nVOC\nWBPWRD\n", "\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n", "ABBREVIATIONS\n", "Asian Development Bank\nCentral Road Fund\neconomic internal rate of return\nEnvironmental Mitigation Action Plan\nGovernment of West Bengal\nJapan Bank for International Cooperation\nkilometer\nMinistry of Road Transport and Highways\nNational Highways Authority of India\nnational highway\nproject implementation unit\nPublic Works Road Department\nResettlement Plan\nright-of-way\nstate highway\nState Transport Corporation\nsexually transmitted diseases\ntechnical assistance\nvehicle operating cost\nWest Bengal Public Works (Roads) Department\n", "NOTES\n", "(i)\n", "The fiscal year (FY) of the Government ends on 31 March.
