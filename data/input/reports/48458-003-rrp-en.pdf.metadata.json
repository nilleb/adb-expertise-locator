The  program \nsupports the government\u2019s main reform priorities to promote, develop, and efficiently implement \npublic\u2013private  partnership  (PPP)  projects  by  (i)  strengthening  government  financial  support  to \nPPPs,  (ii)  expanding  and  efficiently \nimplementing  the  pipeline  of  PPP  projects,  and  \n(iii)  strengthening  the  legal  and  regulatory  frameworks  for  PPPs.  The  design  and  monitoring \nframework is in Appendix 1. Subprogram 2 is included in ADB\u2019s country operations business plan, \n(2018\u20132020) for the Philippines.1 \n \n\nII. \n\nPROGRAM AND RATIONALE \n\nBackground and Development Constraints \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nThe  programmatic  approach  and  budget  support.  The  use  of  a  programmatic \napproach  with  a  policy-based  loan  (PBL)  and  TA  aligns  ADB\u2019s  support  with  the  government\u2019s \nreform program. The approach also provides incentives and capacity to complete the reforms with \nflexibility  to  add  new  priority  reforms  in  subsequent  subprograms.  ADB\u2019s  Board  of  Directors \napproved the programmatic approach and a loan for subprogram 1 on 26 November 2015.2 The \nprogram included two subprograms and was aligned with the government\u2019s strategy to step up \nprivate  investment  in  infrastructure.  The  first  subprogram  focused  on  creating  an  enabling \nregulatory  environment for  PPPs  and  developing  a  robust  pipeline  of  projects.  In addition,  two \ntechnical  assistance  (TA)  projects  underpinned  the  programmatic  approach  to  improve \ngovernment  capacity to develop  and implement PPP  projects.3 Subprogram  2  now focuses on \nconsolidating  PPP  reforms  to  stimulate  and  facilitate  the  development  of  the  Philippines\u2019  PPP \nmarket and to ensure the earlier reforms are successfully implemented. The inclusion of the post-\nprogram partnership framework (P3F), 2018\u20132022 will continue ADB\u2019s engagement utilizing TA.  \n \n4. \nThe  development  problem. The Philippines  has  been  an  economic  leader  among the \nAssociation of Southeast Asian Nations member countries since the global financial crisis, with \nan  average  economic  growth  rate  of  6.2%  per  year  during  2011\u20132017.  To  maintain  this \nmomentum,  the  Philippine  Development  Plan  2017\u20132022  (PDP),  continues  the  government\u2019s \nemphasis on inclusive growth. Under the PDP, the government has set a strategic target to reach \nupper middle-income status by 2022. It has also targeted gross domestic product (GDP) growth \nof 7%\u20138% per year in real terms, with GDP per capita increasing from $3,550 in 2015 to $5,000 \nby 2022. However, public investment, particularly in infrastructure, is insufficient to meet these \ngoals.  Infrastructure  gaps  represent  major  bottlenecks  for  foreign  investment  and  higher \neconomic  growth.  According  to  the  World  Economic  Forum  Global  Competitiveness  Report \n(2017\u20132018),  the  country\u2019s  infrastructure  competitiveness  ranking  stands  at  97th  place  out  of  \n\n                                                \n1  ADB. 2017.

Manila. \n\n\f2 \n\n137 countries surveyed, well behind regional peers Indonesia (52nd), Malaysia (22nd) and Thailand \n(43th). 4 With its fast-growing economy, archipelagic geography, expanding population, and rapid \nurbanization, the Philippines requires more and better infrastructure investments. \n \nIn recognition of this challenge, the government launched a comprehensive infrastructure \n5. \ndevelopment program, named Build, Build, Build (BBB), in April 2017. The BBB program aims to \nattract  investments,  connect  regions  and  markets,  generate  jobs,  and  spur  economic  growth \nthrough infrastructure development. The BBB program calls for an increase in public spending on \ninfrastructure  from  5.1%  of  GDP  in  2016  to  7.4%  of  GDP  by  2022.  To  achieve  the  targeted \ninfrastructure  outlays  over  this  period,  the  BBB  program  will  generate  $168  billion  in  total \nestimated  funding  requirements.  To  meet  these  requirements,  the  government  plans  to  raise \nfunds  from  three  primary  sources:  direct  government  expenditure,  private  capital,  and  official \ndevelopment assistance. Flagship projects under the BBB program include railways (e.g., Malolos \nto Clark railway), roads (e.g., NLEX\u2013SLEX Connector road, NAIA Expressways phase II, Laguna \nlakeshore ring road, and Northeast Luzon expressway), airports (Clark International Airport), and \nurban infrastructure (e.g., Metro Manila Rail Transit line extensions and Davao bus improvement \nsystem).5 To facilitate an increase in direct public spending on infrastructure, the government has \nimplemented a focused set of reforms to increase the efficiency and depth of capital markets.6 In \nparallel  with  direct  public  spending, the government  is  also placing  an increased  emphasis  on \nPPPs  to  tap  private  sector  expertise.  Specifically,  the  government  is  targeting  up  to  18%  of \ninfrastructure  investments  under  the  Public  Investment  Program  (PIP)  for  2017\u20132022  to  be \ndelivered through PPPs valued at $25.5 billion. \n \n6. \nThe  government  has  already  done  much  to  provide  appropriate  incentives  to  mobilize \nprivate  resources  for  financing  infrastructure  projects  and  services.  Recognizing  the  private \nsector\u2019s large untapped potential to provide infrastructure, the government put PPPs at the center \nof  infrastructure development.  In  fact,  the  Philippines  has  emerged  as  a  dynamic  PPP  market \nsince  its  program  was  launched  in  late  2010.  Previously  classified  as  an  emerging  country  in \nterms  of  PPP  readiness  (2011),  the  country  now  scores  high  (seventh  position)  in  the  overall \nranking,  joining  India,  the  Republic  of  Korea  and  Japan.7  The  Organisation  for  Economic  Co-\noperation  and  Development  considers  the  PPP  framework  in  the  Philippines  a  success.8  The \nlegal,  regulatory,  and  institutional  frameworks,  as  well  as  the  underlying  financial  support \nstructure,  have  all  been  strengthened.  The  government  reorganized  the  Public\u2013Private \nPartnership  Center  (PPP  Center)  into  a  more  dynamic  agency  and  designated  it  as  the  main \nfacilitating and monitoring agency. Project preparation and development has been streamlined \nthrough  the  establishment  of  the  Project  Development  and  Monitoring  Facility  (PDMF)  to  fund \ntransaction  advisors.  However,  more  needs  to  be  done.  The  new  administration  continues  a \nstrong commitment to developing an enabling policy framework that allows PPPs to flourish, with \nthe understanding that there is a need to ensure an investment program based on an optimal mix \nof government financing, official development assistance, and private capital. In tandem with the \nmuch larger project pipeline being rolled out under the BBB program, leveraging public resources \nvia private participation remains relevant. PPPs can raise the quality of life for citizens by providing \n                                                \n4   World Economic Forum. 2017. Global Competitiveness Report (2017\u20132018).

Bangkok.  \n\nInfrascope. \n\n \n\n\fquality public services through social infrastructure projects. The engagement of local government \nunits (LGUs) in the delivery of infrastructure through PPPs is essential in this regard. \n \n7. \nBinding constraints. The government recognizes the challenges it faces in sustaining \nand  capitalizing  on  the  impressive  progress  made  in  its  PPP  program,  including  the  need  to:  \n(i) provide sufficient financial support to PPPs; (ii) expand the pipeline of projects; (iii) and further \nstrengthen the legal and institutional framework (paras. 8\u201311). \n \n8. \nFinancial  and  fiscal  risks  must  be  continuously  managed  to  encourage  private \nparticipation. First, the government needs to provide adequate funding to support its share of \nPPP projects and manage the associated financial risks. In the absence of budgeted funds for \nright-of-way acquisitions and resettlement costs,  project costs may escalate, and implementation \ntime  frames  may  extend.  Second,  the  government  needs  to  institutionalize  the  management \nsystem for, and funding of, PPP contingent liabilities to minimize its exposure to fiscal costs and \nimprove the attractiveness of projects for private investors. \n \n9. \nProject  planning  and  programming  must  also  be  strengthened  to  address \ncontinuing weaknesses in project implementation. Two primary constraints have adversely \naffected the project development process. First, the government has not yet developed integrated \ntransport infrastructure plans. Specifically, a master plan is needed to unify the results of various \ntransport-related  plans which have been  formulated for  the respective transport  subsectors  by \nentities  at  both  the  national  and  local  government  levels.  A  national  transport  policy  and  a \ntransportation system master plan would ensure that transport projects are strategically built and \noperated  to  complement  each  other  within  an  interconnected  network  of  multimodal  systems. \nSecond, there are deficiencies in the project prioritization process, leading to poor selection and \nstructuring of infrastructure projects. The challenge is to ensure that the highest priority projects \nare built regardless of procurement modalities. Currently, the implementing agencies designate \nPPP  projects  before  they  are  screened  by  the Infrastructure  Coordination Committee. Instead, \nprojects should be screened early in the development stages to determine project feasibility and \nthe procurement model that is expected to achieve greatest value for money for the government \nand the public. Implementing agencies need to ensure that due diligence is undertaken prior to \nsubmission of projects to the Infrastructure Coordination Committee. \n \n10. \nThe ability of LGUs to utilize PPPs to meet localized infrastructure development is very \nlimited. While many small municipalities  lack the capacity to take on PPPs and have a limited tax \nbase from which to increase own source revenues there are other LGUs from highly urbanized \ncities that can benefit from the PPP approach. These cities are experiencing pressure for better \ninfrastructure  and  services  stemming  from  their  transformation  into  growing  urban  centers.  In \nrecognition, implementing LGU PPPs at the local level has been identified as one of the priorities \nof the government. In line with this priority, the PPP Center is strengthening the support it provides \nto LGUs to develop and implement PPP projects, including pilot LGU projects in priority sectors \n(water  supply  and  sanitation,  solid-waste  management  facilities,  and  transport  terminals). \nHowever,  customized  capacity  building  and  support  will  be  required  to  support  LGUs  at  each \nstage of preparation, development, procurement, and implementation. \n \n11. \nThe legal and regulatory framework should be further strengthened. The Philippines \nwas  one  of  the  first  countries  in the  region  to  embrace  private  participation  in the  provision  of \npublic  infrastructure,  and  there  has  been  an  ongoing  process  of  evolution  of  the  legal  and \nregulatory  framework.  While  the  regulatory  framework  has  been  strengthened  since  2013, \nadditional refinements are needed including alternative tools for resolving disputes such as those \narising from a contract. In addition, a unique feature of the Philippine framework is that the most \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\fPolicy Reform and ADB\u2019s Value Addition \n\nimportant institutions, including the PPP Center and the PDMF, have been created by executive \norders  of the  President of  the  Philippines. While  this  signifies  high-level  political  support,  such \nstructures  and  institutions  should  be  institutionalized  to  ensure  the  continued  suitability  and \nstability of the legal framework. \n \nB. \n \n12. \nThe  government\u2019s  reform  agenda.  The  Philippines  was  the  first  country  in  Asia  to \ninstitutionalize private sector participation in infrastructure and development projects by enacting \nthe Build\u2013Operate\u2013Transfer (BOT) Law in 1990. In 2010, the government announced that PPPs \nwould be a key component of its overall strategy for inclusive growth, and initiated governance \nreforms to the BOT framework. These reforms included the establishment of the PPP Governing \nBoard, the PPP Center, and the PDMF. In 2016, the government launched the BBB infrastructure \nprogram and included the PPP program in its Ten-Point Socioeconomic Agenda, highlighting the \nPhilippines\u2019  commitment  to  facilitating  private  participation  in  infrastructure  investment.  To \nincrease  spending  on  public  infrastructure  (para  5),  the  government  will:  (i)  encourage  private \nsector participation; (ii) formulate and update master plans and road maps to implement projects \nin  a  harmonized  and  well-coordinated;  (iii)  strengthen  linkages  between  planning,  investment, \nprogramming, and budgeting; and (iv) minimize project implementation delays. \n \nPolicy  reforms.  The  program  supports  the  following  reform  areas:  (i)  strengthening \n13. \ngovernment financial support to PPPs; (ii) expanding and efficiently implementing the pipeline of \nPPP  projects;  and  (iii)  strengthening  the  legal  and  regulatory  frameworks  for  PPPs.  At  the \ninception  of  the  programmatic  approach  in  2015,  the  government  agreed  to  accomplish  \n10 expected prior actions (or triggers) and six policy milestones as a basis for subprogram 2.9 All \n10 prior actions have been accomplished. During processing of subprogram 2, two prior actions \nwere merged as they were complementary. A new prior action to capture efforts to enhance the \nproject screening process was added and a prior action was split into two actions \u2013 one of which \nis the enhanced focus on the development of LGU PPP projects, which exceeded expectations. \n \n14. \nAt the government\u2019s request, ADB also agreed to refine some policy milestones with the \naim of streamlining the policy matrix. Four of these milestones were merged into two policy actions \nas  they  were  complementary  and  related  to  similar  reforms.  Two  new  policy  milestones  were \nadded  to  recognize  the  development  of  an  LGU  engagement  strategy  and  to  recognize  the \nexpansion of the PPP service office by the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH). \nSubprogram  2  now  contains  17  reform  actions  (11  expected  prior  actions  representing  high-\nimpact reforms and six policy milestones), which the government accomplished in advance during \nJuly  2015\u2013August  2017.  The  changes  in  the  policy  matrix  are  reflected  in  the  design  and \nmonitoring framework (Appendix 1). \n \nGovernment financial support to public\u2013private partnerships. This reform area builds \n15. \non  the  accomplishments  of  subprogram  1  and  ensures  the  fiscal  sustainability  of  government \ndirect  and  contingent  support \nframework. \nto  PPP  projects  within \nAccomplishments under subprogram 2 included the allocation of \u20bd51.5 billion by the Department \nof Budget and Management to cover right-of-way acquisition and resettlement costs as well as to \nensure  access  to  major  infrastructure  facilities.  Adequate  funding  for  these  preconstruction \nactivities also prevents implementation delays.

In  addition,  the  technical  working  group  on  contingent  liability  strengthened  and \nimplemented consistent monitoring of PPP projects, while the Bureau of the Treasury improved \nthe valuation of contingent liability stock and flows to reduce the likelihood of fiscal shocks. The \ntechnical working group also strengthened the policy framework and implemented new guidelines \nthat  govern  the  application  for  and  evaluation  of  claims  to  the  Risk  Management  Program.  A \nviability  gap  funding  scheme  was  institutionalized  in  subprogram  1,  however  none  of  the  PPP \ncontracts to date have required it.10 \n \nPipeline of public\u2013private partnership projects. Reforms in this area have facilitated \n16. \nan increase in PPP arrangements which allows the government to tap private sector expertise, \nefficiency, and innovation. Accomplishments under subprogram 2 include: (i) the government\u2019s \ncompetitive tender and award of 12 national PPP projects totaling $4.47 billion since the inception \nof the program; and (ii) the completion of feasibility studies for six national PPP projects (out of \nthe  pipeline  of  23)  which  subsequently  progressed  to  the  next  step  of  preparation,  evidencing \ncontinuous development of a robust PPP project pipeline.11 \n \nGiven  the  pressing  need  to  develop  transport  infrastructure,  the  government  has  also \n17. \nintroduced several  initiatives to develop  a strong pipeline  of  transport  infrastructure  projects  in \nsupport  of  its  BBB  program.  First,  the  government  developed  the  PIP,  2017\u20132022,  which  is  a  \n6-year programming document accompanying the PDP that sets out the priority programs and \nprojects  to  be  implemented  by  the  government.  To  support  the  PIP,  the  Three-Year  Rolling \nInfrastructure Program was developed under the national budget to ensure funding for projects \nthat need to be implemented immediately, including the first batch of five PPPs originating from \nthe Department of Transportation (DOTr). To streamline the development of PPPs in the transport \nsector,  the government approved  the  National Transport  Policy  (NTP)  in  June  2017. The  NTP \nguides all transport-related agencies as they pursue policy decisions and future investment, and \ncoordinates efforts between the national and local levels. Under the NTP, PPPs and privatization \nof  public  transport  operations  are  evaluated  in  an  effort  to  augment  government  resources, \nharness  private  sector  expertise,  gain  technology  transfers  and  operational  efficiencies,  and \nassign risks to the party best able to control, influence or manage risks and their consequences. \nThe formulation of the Philippine Transportation System Master Plan, on a nationwide scale, is \nembedded  in  the  NTP  and  ensures  a  holistic,  well-coordinated,  and  evidence-based  project \nselection process. \n \n18. \nIn  addition,  the  PPP  Center  undertook  significant  structural  enhancements.  In  line  with \nglobal best practices, the government adopted guidelines to put in place (i) probity advisors in \nprocurement (for both solicited and unsolicited proposals) to help ensure that tender processes \nare  impartial,  and  (ii)  independent  construction  supervisors  to  provide  support  during \nimplementation.  To  fund  the  activities,  the  government  allocated  \u20bd800  million  in  2016  to  the \nPDMF.  A  panel  of  probity  advisors  was  established  in  September  2017,  and  a  panel  of \nconstruction supervisors was established in May 2017. Consequently, probity and construction \n\n                                                \n10 Viability gap funding is a grant provided by the government to assist the economic viability of projects with high social \n\nreturns.  \n\n11 As of 19 April 2018, there are 23 national PPP projects in the pipeline, with an estimated cost of $1.92 billion. This \n\ndoes not include 16 projects with costs yet to be finalized or under final approval. \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\f \n\nsupervisors  will  be  assigned  to  projects  in  2018.12  To  strengthen  project  monitoring,  the  PPP \nCenter established a new division which is now staffed with six project evaluation officers who are \nactively monitored the implementation of 16 awarded PPP projects.13 Within the government, the \nDOTr  and  the  DPWH  have  also  undertaken  structural  enhancements  to  support  PPP \ndevelopment and implementation. To encourage the development of PPP projects by LGUs, the \nPPP Center launched a new LGU engagement strategy to assist in identifying and developing \nlocal  projects.  Direct  support  has  also  been  provided  to  LGUs  through  in-house  project-based \ninternships,  partnerships  with  training  institutions,  and  the  establishment  of  separate  project \ndevelopment facilities. Utilizing this support, two LGU PPP projects were awarded, one has been \ntendered, and two feasibility studies have been completed. Another 10 LGU PPPs are in project \ndevelopment stages. All projects reflect gender equality in accordance with PPP Center gender \nguidelines. \n \n19. \nGiven  the  ambitious  volume  of  planned  infrastructure  projects,  there  is  the  need  to \ncarefully identify which projects will be designated PPP projects. To this end, the government has \ninitiated the strengthening of its investment project screening mechanism with the aim of selecting \nthe appropriate procurement modality for each project in the early stages of the approval process. \nThe  new  screening  process  will  require  the  determination  of  project  feasibility  before  the \nprocurement method is selected. \n \nLegal  and  regulatory  frameworks  for  public\u2013private  partnerships.  Reforms  in  this \n20. \narea  focus  on  further  strengthening  the  legal  and regulatory  framework  for  project  preparation \nand approval. Accomplishments under subprogram 2 include the adoption of policy circulars by \nthe  PPP  Governing  Board  to:  (i)  streamline  the  PPP  project  appraisal  process;  (ii)  guide \nimplementing agencies in project identification, risk allocation, and project approval; and (iii) adopt \nbest  practices,  including  hiring  probity  advisors  and  independent  constructions  supervisors  to \ndocument all aspects of procurement processes and to monitor project construction. In addition, \nthe government has issued implementing rules and regulations to operationalize  the executive \norder  mandating  the  inclusion  of  provisions  on  the  use  of  alternative  dispute  resolution \nmechanisms  in  all  contracts  involving  PPP  projects.  The  use  of  alternative  dispute  resolution \nmechanisms  will  reduce  time-consuming  court  litigation  that  could  potentially  delay  or  derail \nprojects and discourage investors from entering into PPP contracts with the government. \n \n21. \nPost-program  partnership  framework.  While  nonbinding,  the  P3F  provides  for  a \nstructured  dialogue  over  the  medium  term  between  ADB  and  the  government,  as  well  as  a \nframework for continuing TA support.14 Under this framework, ADB will support the government\u2019s \nefforts to increase the institutional capacity of LGUs and their awareness of PPPs through the \nPPP  Center\u2019s  work  plan  to  provide  project  advisory  support  to  LGUs.  In  addition,  ADB  will \nenhance  the  linkage  between  the  planning,  programming,  and  budgeting  processes  of  the \ngovernment through an investment program based on an optimal mix of government financing, \nofficial  development  assistance,  and  private  capital.  The  PPP  Governing  Board  and  the  PPP \nCenter will continue to improve the regulatory framework and implementation guidelines covering \nunsolicited proposals and PPP hybrid financing. Finally, the government will submit amendments \nto the BOT Law, and its implementing rules and regulations, to Congress for approval. \n \n\n                                                \n12 Probity advisors will be assigned to the East\u2013West Rail Project (unsolicited proposal) and independent construction \nsupervisors will be assigned to the Civil Registry System-Information Technology II Project and Clark International \nAirport Expansion Project. \n\n13 Sixteen awarded projects since the establishment of the PPP Center in September 2010. \n14  Support  for  the  P3F  will  be  provided  through  ADB.  2016.  Technical  Assistance  for  Support  to  the  Association of \n\nSoutheast Asian Nations Economic Community. Manila (TA 9229-REG). \n\n6 \n\n \n\n\fADB  experience.  ADB  has  supported  PPPs  through  a mix  of  modalities  including  TA, \n22. \nproject financing, and policy-based loans (Figure 1). Beginning with two TA projects (footnote 3), \nADB supported the revitalization of the PPP program of the government by building the capacity \nof the PPP Center and implementing agencies, institutionalizing the PDMF, providing transaction \nadvisory  services,  and  introducing  measures  to  enhance  fiscal  support  to  PPPs.  The \nGovernments of Australia and Canada, and ADB supported the establishment of the PDMF  to \nprepare  bankable  PPP  projects.  ADB  also  provides  transaction  advisory  services  on  the \nPhilippine  National  Railway  South  Commuter  Project,  and  to  the  Bases  Conversion  and \nDevelopment  Authority  regarding  PPPs  in  Clark  Green  City.  ADB  provided  financing  for  the \nexpansion and renovation of the Mactan\u2013Cebu Airport terminal, and for the development of the \nlargest wind farm in the Philippines. ADB is assisting Cebu City in undertaking feasibility studies \nfor a solid-waste management project through the Asia Pacific Project Preparation Facility.15 To \nsupport the government\u2019s BBB program agenda, ADB approved a TA loan to support preparation \nof future public infrastructure investments.16 The Encouraging Investment through Capital Market \nReforms Program provides support to enhance long-term infrastructure finance (footnote 6) and \na proposed local governance program planned for 2019 will focus on public financial management \n(PFM), municipal finance, and infrastructure. \n \n\n \n\n \nFigure 1: ADB\u2019s Engagement in Public\u2013Private Partnerships \n\n \n\n \n\n \nOPPP  =  Office  of  Public-Private  Partnership,  PPP  =  public-private  partnership,  TA  =  technical \nassistance. \n\n \n \n \n23. \nLessons  learned.  ADB\u2019s  engagement  helped  inform  the  program  by  highlighting  key \nlessons learned. First, a whole of government approach and appropriate governance is necessary \nto implement  a  successful  PPP  program.  Second, the  motivations and  context for  undertaking \nPPPs  in  emerging  economies  can  differ from those  in developed  economies with mature PPP \nprograms.  Nevertheless,  emerging  economies  should  consider  introducing  practices  from \ndeveloped economies where these will enhance the success of the PPP program. For example, \nthe Philippines has introduced the appointment of a probity adviser for large and complex projects \nto help ensure that the tender process is impartial and fair to all bidders. This is a role seen in \n\n                                                \n15 The  $73  million  facility  is  a  multi-donor  trust  fund  that  assists  structuring  infrastructure  projects  with  private \n\nparticipation. \n\n16  ADB. 2017.

Third, development  of a successful PPP program relies \nheavily on the government\u2019s ability to make available the financial and human resources required \nto properly identify, appraise, structure, tender, manage, and monitor projects. Fourth, programs \nshould exhibit sufficient flexibility to accommodate  a medium to long development horizon and \nchanges in the addenda of reform champions. Finally, governments should carefully investigate \nwhether traditional infrastructure procurement or PPP investment is likely to yield most value for \nmoney.  Although  governments  increasingly  use  PPPs,  these  arrangements  still  constitute  a \nrelatively small component of total public-sector investment (footnote 8).  \n \n24. \nADB\u2019s value addition to program design and implementation. ADB\u2019s structured policy \ndialogue  with  the  government  under  the  PBL  helped  to  jointly  identify  and  address  the  legal, \npolicy, and regulatory issues necessary to implement a successful PPP program. The range of \nimprovements and their timing demonstrates a commitment to adjusting approaches to PPPs in \nresponse  to  changing  circumstances.  In  addition,  ADB  provided  support  to  strengthen  the \ncapacity  of  the  National  Economic  and  Development  Authority  to  undertake  timely  and quality \nappraisal  of  PPP  projects  through  on-the-job  advisory  support  on  actual  PPP  projects.  This \nprocess leads to better infrastructure outcomes and more robust investment planning processes \nwithin  government.  Support  was  also  provided  to  the  Department  of  Finance  (DOF)  to  better \nmanage  the  fiscal  cost  of  the  growing  PPP  portfolio.  As  a  result,  funding  was  allocated  for \ncontingent  liabilities  derived  from  PPP  projects, and budgetary  provisions  were  made to cover \nright-of-way acquisition and resettlement. ADB also supported the establishment of the PDMF to \nfund  project  preparation,  structuring,  tendering,  and  related  advisory  services. This  reform  has \nreduced  the  risk  that  a  project  fails  because  of  deficient  preparation,  structuring,  or  tendering \nprocesses. The TA also provided capacity building to strengthen the PPP enabling environment \nand  to  institutionalize  PPP  best  practices  (footnote  3).  The  integrated  approach  combining  TA \nand PBL assistance has led to impressive results. Most importantly, during the program\u2019s period, \n12 national PPP projects totaling $4.47 billion have been competitively tendered and awarded, \nwith 10 under implementation and 2 fully operational. Moreover, public infrastructure investment \nreached 5.4% of GDP in 2017. \n \n25. \nDevelopment  partner  coordination.  ADB  has  forged  a  strong  partnership  with  the \ngovernments  of  Australia  (Department  of  Foreign  Affairs  and  Trade)  and  Canada.  Both  have \nprovided significant cofinancing to ADB\u2019s ongoing TA for strengthening PPPs in the Philippines \nand focused on the development of the institutional framework for identifying and implementing \nPPPs.  Australia\u2019s  Department  of  Foreign  Affairs  and  Trade  is  also  providing  a  review  and \nrecommendations  to  the  DOTr  to  support  a  reorganization  to  strengthen  its  role  in  the  BBB \nprogram. The Government of France through the French Development Agency-Agence Fran\u00e7aise \nde D\u00e9veloppement (AFD) is exploring the possibility to provide parallel collaborative cofinancing \nof subprogram 2. The Japan International Cooperation Agency has provided capacity building on \nPPP project formulation to identified implementing agencies (Department of Health, DPWH, and \nDOTr) by undertaking capacity assessments and capacity development plans. The World Bank, \nunder  its  Water  and  Sanitation  Program,  supported  the  institutionalization  of  a  national \ngovernment  PPP  technical  working  group  for  local  water  PPPs  and  a  toolkit  for  water  and \nsanitation PPPs for LGUs. The United States Department of the Treasury is providing a full-time \nadvisor to the PPP Center and the Securities Exchange Commission. ADB has also coordinated \nwith the International Monetary Fund to develop and publish a joint knowledge product on PPPs \nin the Philippines.17 \n\n                                                \n17 ADB and International Monetary Fund. 2017.

PPPs can be a central element of national economic \ndevelopment.  On  a  project  level,  the  program  generates  quantifiable  net  benefits  with  a  net \npresent  value  of  $1.5  billion,  supplementing  the  $1.30  billion  in  net  benefits  achieved  under \nsubprogram 1.18 The analysis mirrors the methodology and assumptions utilized for subprogram \n1  and  reflects  the  continuity  of  reforms  through  the  programmatic  approach.  Gross  economic \ngains  of  $  1.9  billion  arise  primarily  out  of:  (i)  an  increase  in  the  overall  level  of  infrastructure \ninvestments that would not have occurred without the PPP program; and (ii) estimated efficiency \ngains (in terms of project costs within budget and timely completion) associated with PPP projects. \nCosts of the program aggregate an estimated $0.4 billion and arise primarily out of administrative \nrequirements and the cost of reserving against potential contingent liabilities.  \n \nD. \n \n27. \nThe government has requested a single tranche loan of $300 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary \ncapital resources to help finance subprogram 2.19  The loan will have a 15-year term, including a \ngrace period of 3 years, annuity method with 30% discount, an annual interest rate determined in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility,  a \ncommitment charge of 0.15% per year, and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft \nloan agreement. The average maturity is 12.1 years, and there is no maturity premium payable \nto  ADB.  The  AFD  is  exploring  the  possibility  to  provide  parallel  collaborative  cofinancing  for \nsubprogram  2.  The  loan  size  is  based  on  the  Philippines\u2019  financing  needs,  the  development \nimpact of the policy reform package, and development spending arising from the reform. In 2018, \nthe government\u2019s total gross borrowing requirement is estimated at $17.4 billion, one-fifth of which \nwill be from foreign borrowing. The foreign borrowing will comprise government bonds estimated \nat $1.0 billion, and official development assistance estimated at $2.5 billion. \n \nE. \n \n28. \nThe DOF is the executing agency, and the National Economic and Development Authority, \nDOTr,  DPWH,  PPP  Center,  DOF  Bureau  of  the  Treasury,  and  the  Department  of  Budget  and \nManagement  are  the  implementing  agencies.  The  implementation  period  is  July  2015\u2013August \n2017. A steering committee chaired by the DOF with the implementing agencies as members will \noversee the program\u2019s implementation. The steering committee will meet semi-annually and, if \nneeded, on an ad hoc basis to monitor the continuing implementation of reforms under the P3F. \nThe  proceeds  of  the  policy-based  loan  will  be  withdrawn  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan \nDisbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from time to time). \n \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\n \n29. \nSafeguards.  Subprogram  2  will  not  entail  any  involuntary  resettlement  or  affect \nindigenous  people  or  the  environment.  It  is  classified  category  C  for  environment,  involuntary \nresettlement and indigenous peoples. \n \n30. \nPoverty  and  social.  Beneficiaries  of  the  program  include  enterprises,  consumers, \nemployees,  and  the  poor  in  general.  Enterprises  will  benefit  from  greater  competitiveness \n\n                                                \n18 Program Impact Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n19 The loan may be disbursed in one or more installments. \n \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\nbecause  of  better  infrastructure.  Consumers  will  gain  from  better  access  to  services  through \nenhanced infrastructure. Reforms under the program will create jobs and help reduce poverty.  \n \n31. \nGovernance.  The  government  continues  to  strengthen  its  PFM.  The  2017  public \nexpenditure and financial accountability assessment confirmed that three of the seven core areas \n(transparency, policy-based budgeting, and asset\u2013liability management) have improved and are \nnow considered strong. Areas of weakness\u2014budget credibility, predictability and control in budget \nexecution, and external scrutiny and audit\u2014are being actively addressed. The proposed Public \nFinancial  Accountability  Act  will  help  to  enforce  accountability  in  the  PFM  system.  The \ngovernment is implementing a results-based anticorruption plan, to strengthen the Office of the \nOmbudsman and the justice sector. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was \nexplained to and discussed with the government and the DOF. \n \nRisk and mitigating measures. The program has three substantial risks.20 National risks \n32. \ninclude weaknesses in the PFM system and corruption. To mitigate these risks, the government \nhas strengthened the budget review process, reduced the number and size of special purpose \nfunds, and institutionalized transparency as a precondition to accessing public funds. To reduce \ncorruption  risks,  the  Good  Governance  and  Anti-Corruption  Cabinet  Cluster  of  the  Philippines \nimplemented a comprehensive and results-based anticorruption action plan. A contextual risk is \nthe delay in PPP procurement for efficient project implementation. Mitigation measures  include \nguidelines on probity advisory services to enhance third-party oversight of the bidding process. \n \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n \nThe government and the DOF have assured ADB that implementation of the program shall \n33. \nconform  to  all  applicable  ADB  policies  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the loan agreement.  \n \n\nV. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n \n34. \nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  policy-based  loan  would  comply  with  the  Articles  of \nAgreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve the \nloan of $300,000,000 to the Republic of the Philippines for subprogram 2 of the Expanding Private \nParticipation in Infrastructure Program, from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, on regular terms, \nwith interest to be determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-\nbased lending facility; for a term of 15 years, including a grace period of 3 years; and such other \nterms  and  conditions  as  are  substantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  draft  loan \nagreement presented to the Board. \n\n \nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n \n\n                                                \n20 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n \n\n27 July 2018\n\n \n\n\fAppendix 1 \n\n11 \n\nRisks \n\nProcyclical fiscal \npolicy does not create \nadditional fiscal space \nto increase public \nexpenditure. \n\nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n\n \n\n \n\nCountry\u2019s Overarching Development Objective \nPublic spending on infrastructure increased to 7.4% of gross domestic product by 2022 (Philippine \nDevelopment Plan, 2017\u20132022) a \n\nResults Chain \nEffect of the Reform \nPrivate participation \nin infrastructure \nimproved \n\nReform Areas under \nSubprogram 2 \n1.
