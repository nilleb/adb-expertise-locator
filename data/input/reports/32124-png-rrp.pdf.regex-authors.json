Environmental assessment was undertaken for all 11 \nAssessment  proposed  road  sections,  and  a  summary  initial  environmental \nexamination is provided in Appendix 10. \n   \nProject Description  The  supplementary  financial  assistance  will  finance  additional \nroad upgrading and rehabilitation subprojects with a length of 270 \nkilometers  (km)  in  the  five  Highlands  provinces  and  related \nconsulting  services  for  project  implementation  and  training, \ndesign,  construction  supervision,  and  project  performance \nmonitoring and evaluation. \n \nRationale  Justifying the supplementary financial assistance are four main \npoints \n(i)  The proceeds of Road Maintenance and Upgrading \n(Sector) Project (Loan 1709-PNG) have been fully \ncommitted and are able to finance only 50.4% of \nthe total length of roads targeted in the original \nproject scope. The additional proposed subprojects \nto  be  financed  by  supplementary  financial \nassistance will enable achievement of 91% of the \noriginally targeted road length. \n(ii)  The proposed supplementary financial assistance \nis  in  line  with  the  Government\u2019s  development \nstrategy, which continues to emphasize improving \ntransport infrastructure. \n(iii)  Supplementary  financing  is  consistent  with  the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) country strategy \nfor Papua New Guinea (PNG). \n(iv)  Supplementary  financial  assistance  will  save \nsubstantial project start-up cost and is the most \nefficient  and  effective  way  to  improve  road \ninfrastructure in the Highlands. \n \nUsing Asian Development Fund (ADF) financing is justified by \nADB\u2019s  country  classification  and  PNG\u2019s  social  and  economic \nstatus. PNG is an ADB category B2 country whose limited debt \nrepayment capacity entitles it to limited ADF financing.  \n \nA recent assessment found that the incidence of poverty in PNG \nincreased from 37.5% of the population in 1996 to 54% in 2003. ", "ii   \nThe Highlands are home to the highest proportion of the poor. \nThe  region  is  mountainous  and  geologically  unstable,  with \ntorrential rains that can last 6 or 7 months. Road construction and \nmaintenance are costly, requiring concessional funding. \n   \nImpact and Outcome  The proposed road subprojects for supplementary financing are in \nline with the impact and outcome of the Project as approved by \nADB. It aims to scale up the Project\u2019s impact on PNG economic \ndevelopment  and  social  integration  by  financing  more  road \nsections to (i) improve road access for the private businesses and \ncommunities,  (ii)  reduce  their  travel  costs  and  time  to  major \ncommercial  and  service  centers,  and  (iii)  enable  them  to  tap \neconomic  and  social  opportunities  in  the  Highlands.  It  will \ncontribute  to  (i)  export-led  economic  growth,  (ii)  income \ngeneration for local communities, and (iii) poverty reduction. The \noutcome will be improved rural access to market centers.  \n   \nCost Estimates  The total cost of the proposed road subprojects, including civil \nworks,  consulting  services,  contingencies,  taxes  and  duties, \ninterest  during  construction,  and  other  financial  charges,  is \nestimated at $78.07 million equivalent. \n   \nFinancing Plan  The Government has requested ADB to provide a blend of two \nloans for a total of $53 million, consisting of $35 million from \nordinary capital resources (OCR) and $18 million from ADF. ADB \nwill  finance  68%  of  the  total  cost  of  the  additional  road \nsubprojects,  and  the  Government  will  provide  $25.07  million \ne  quivalent to cover the remaining cost. \nFinancing Plan\n($ million) \nSource  Total  Percent \nAsian Development Bank     \n   OCR  35.00  45 \n   ADF  18.00  23 \nGovernment  25.07  32 \nTotal  78.07     100 \nADF = Asian Development Fund, OCR = ordinary \ncapital resources. \nSource: ADB estimates. \n   \nLoan Amounts and  The two loans totaling $53 million consist of an OCR loan of $35 \nTerms  million and an ADF loan of $18 million. The OCR loan will carry a \nterm of 24 years, with a grace period of 4 years, an interest rate \ndetermined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered \nrate (LIBOR)\u2013based lending facility, and a commitment charge of \n0.75% per annum. The ADF loan will have a maturity of 32 years, \nincluding a grace period of 8 years, an interest charge of 1% per \nannum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter, \nand equal amortization.  \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  Until 30 June 2010  \n   ", "  iii\nEstimated Project   \nCompletion Date  31 December 2009 \n   \nExecuting Agency  The Department of Works (DOW) will continue as the Executing \nImplementation  Agency, and the Highlands Region Maintenance Group (HRMG) \nArrangements  as the Project Implementation Unit (PIU). The project steering \ncommittee will continue to ensure close interagency coordination \nand monitor project implementation.   \n   \nProcurement  Procurement of civil works under supplementary financing will \nfollow  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines.  Civil  works  will  be \ndivided into 16 contract packages, five of them procured under \nnational  competitive  bidding  without  excluding  foreign \ncontractors  and  joint  ventures,  and  11  procured  under \ninternational competitive bidding. \n   \nConsulting Services  International  consultants  will  be  recruited  pursuant  to  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  to  assist  in  (i)  detailed \nengineering design; (ii) preconstruction activities; (iii) construction \nsupervision; (iv) project performance monitoring and evaluation; \nand (v) training on road maintenance, road safety, and prevention \nof HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs). The \nGovernment will recruit and finance local consultants for (i) project \ndesign; (ii) construction supervision; (iii) financial auditing; and (iv) \ntraining  on  road  maintenance,  road  safety,  and  STI/HIV/AIDS \nprevention. \n   \nProject Benefits and  The  proposed  subprojects  for  supplementary  financing  will \nBeneficiaries  generate substantial economic benefits. Using a 12% discount \nrate, the net present value is $56.89 million, and the economic \nrate  of  return  is  18.8%.  The  proposed  subprojects  are  feeder \nroads  servicing  a  population  of  about  600,000.  They  will \ncontribute to poverty alleviation in the Highlands by (i) providing \njob opportunities, (ii) increasing farmers\u2019 income from cash crops, \nand (iii) facilitating access to social services. It is estimated that \n1,500 local employment opportunities will be directly generated by \nimplementing the proposed subprojects, and an additional 6,000 \njob  opportunities  will  be  created  through  the  maintenance \nprogram for the roads completed under the Project. \n   \nRisks and Assumptions  The subprojects to be financed under the Project are subject to \nthe usual risks for road sector projects, including project start-up \ndelay,  road  sustainability,  environmental  impact,  and \nSTI/HIV/AIDS  exposure.  The  design  of  the  Project  takes  into \naccount  these  risks  and  includes  mitigating  measures.  To \nminimize  project  start-up  delay,  all  11  road  subprojects  have \nalready been screened, and due diligence has been completed. \nThe  existing  implementation  arrangement,  including  consulting \nservices for project implementation, will be maintained to ensure \ncontinuity and avoid disruption. Procurement of civil works will \nfollow a single-stage one-evelope bidding procedure with post-\nqualification  to  expedite  the  process.  HRMG  will  implement  a \n ", "iv   \ncontracting-out  system  to  engage  local  communities  or \ncontractors  to  provide  routine  and  periodic  maintenance  for \ncompleted  ADB-financed  roads  and  ensure  better  financial \nsustainability.  An  assurance  is  included  to  ensure  that  the \nGovernment will maintain the completed road sections funded by \nthe  Project.  Environmental  impacts  during  construction  will  be \nmitigated  by  DOW\u2019s  implementing  the  environmental \nmanagement and monitoring plans. The monitoring results will be \nreflected in the project progress reports. The STI/HIV/AIDS impact \nwill be mitigated by incorporating appropriate conditions in civil \nworks  contracts  that  require  contractors  to  adopt  preventive \nmeasures, supplemented by training and awareness campaigns \nfinanced by the Project. Prevention activities undertaken under \neach road section will be monitored and reflected in the project \nprogress reports to be submitted to the National AIDS Council and \nthe Country Coordinating Mechanism.

THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  report  and  recommendation  on  proposed \nsupplementary loans to Papua New Guinea (PNG) for the Road Maintenance and Upgrading \n(Sector) Project (the Project).1 \n \n \nII.  THE APPROVED PROJECT \nA.  Project Rationale  \n2.  An Asian Development Bank (ADB) report and recommendation of the President (RRP) to \nthe Board of Directors, approved in November 19992, provided a description and rationale for the \nProject. From independence to the early 1990s, PNG\u2019s economy was driven by exports. The \nprimary production area was the Highlands, comprising the provinces of Eastern Highlands, Enga, \nChimbu,  Southern  Highlands,  and  Western  Highlands.  The  region  was  geographically  and \nculturally diverse, with a population of about 2 million, almost half of PNG\u2019s total. In spite of the rich \nnatural resources, the region\u2019s population was predominantly poor, living by subsistence farming \nand  other  basic  livelihoods  and  characterized  by  the  poorest  health,  education,  and  social \nindicators in the country.  \n \n3.  The transport system of PNG was multimodal, comprising about 27,000 kilometers (km) of \nroads; 22 ports; countless wharves, jetties, and landings; 46 airports; and hundreds of airstrips. \nThe road system in the Highlands region consisting of 600 kilometer (km) Highlands Highway \nlinking the five provinces, and feeder roads of about 2,000 km, constituted the backbone of the \nHighlands and the country\u2019s economy. Road conditions were generally poor due to low design \nstandards and lack of maintenance. Almost all unpaved roads had rough riding surfaces, with \nconditions ranging from rough and stony to impassable. Much of the paved road network was \npotholed, and in some areas the road course had reverted to gravel. Vehicles had very high \noperating costs and lasted only 2\u20134 years. Travel distances were extensive, and travel times were \nlong. As a result, local communities (about 1 million people in this region lived within a day\u2019s walk \nof a road) became increasingly isolated. Significant export and business opportunities were lost. \nThis situation led to increased social unrest and deteriorating peace and security conditions. \n \n4.  The Government realized that poor road infrastructure was a major constraint to economic \ngrowth and social development in PNG and identified the maintenance of the road network as a \ndevelopment priority. The national transport infrastructure plan (1992) aimed to provide (i) access \nto markets for farmers and mineral and industrial producers at lower transport costs, and (ii) access \nfor communities to basic social services, including health, education, and government services. \nThe Blueprint on Capital Works 1994\u20132003 of the Department of Transport and Civil Aviation \nprovided an infrastructure investment plan and the national road restoration and construction \nprogram. The program targeted upgrading 935 km of roads and rehabilitating 776 km to (i) promote \nexports  and  agricultural  production,  (ii)  improve  social  service  delivery,  and  (iii)  generate \nemployment opportunities. \n \n5.  ADB\u2019s country strategy for PNG at that time focused on improving (i) governance; (ii) \nprivate sector development, factor productivity, and market access through selected infrastructure \ninvestments;  and  (iii)  social  indicators.  In  the roads  sector,  ADB  strategy  was  to  establish  a \n                                                 \n1  The revised design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  ADB. 1999.

(Loan 1709-PNG, approved on 16 \nNovember). ", "2   \ntradition of good maintenance, an autonomous road authority, and a road trust fund to improve \nsector performance and secure long-term financial sustainability. In line with this strategy, and \nfollowing a sector-wide approach, the Project was designed to improve road infrastructure in the \nHighlands. \n \nB.  Objectives and Scope  \n6.  The objectives of the Project as described in the RRP were to contribute to economic \ngrowth through increased exports and integrate the Highlands\u2019 subsistence population into the \nmainstream economy by (i) improving critical road links, (ii) establishing a sustainable and effective \nroad maintenance operation in the region, and (iii) improving sector management. The scope of the \nProject as defined in the Loan Agreement (Loan 1709-PNG)3 comprised four parts: \n(i)  road improvements in the Highlands by carrying out subprojects consisting of (a) \nupgrading of approximately 220 km of roads, and (b) asset management for road \nnetworks, including rehabilitation of approximately 450 km of roads; \n(ii)  provision of formal technical training to strengthen the institutional capacity of the \nDepartment of Works (DOW) to undertake road maintenance and operation; \n(iii)  provision of detailed engineering design and construction supervision support for the \npreparation and execution of subprojects; and \n(iv)  strengthening  project  implementation  and  road  maintenance  operations  through \ninter alia: (a) on-the-job training on the use of the road asset management system \n(RAMS);  (b)  assistance  in  identification  of  technical  training  programs,  contract \nsupervision,  management,  and  quality  control;  (c)  formulation  of  community \nemployment programs; (d) road network performance monitoring; and (e) financial \nmanagement. \n \nC.  Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n \n7.  The total cost of the Project, including taxes, duties, and interest during construction, was \nestimated at $115 million equivalent. ADB agreed to provide from its ordinary capital resources \n(OCR) a loan of $63 million equivalent, financing 48% of civil works and 55% of the total project \ncost.  \n \n8.  ADB\u2019s loan was provided over 25 years, with a grace period of 5 years and an interest rate \ndetermined in accordance with ADB\u2019s pool-based variable lending rate system for US dollar loans.  \nLoan 1709-PNG was amended on 15 December 2002 to convert it into a London interbank offered \nrate (LIBOR)-based loan with standard lending terms. In September 2003, ADB approved the \nincrease in ADB\u2019s share of financing for civil works from 48% to 70%. This necessitated scaling \ndown the project scope and total project cost from $115 million to $90.6 million.4 The original and \nrevised project cost estimates and financing plans are shown in Table 1. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n3  ADB. 1999.

Manila (17 November). \n4  The length of upgraded road was reduced from 220 km to 145 km, and of rehabilitated road from 450 km to 290 km. In \nhindsight, the need for ADB financing was lower than expected, as few subprojects were approved or contracts \nawarded. As a result, scaling down the project scope appears to have been unnecessary.  \n ", "  3\nTable 1: Original and Revised Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n($ million) \n  Original  Revised  \nItem  Total      Total     \nCost  Govt.

Status of and Progress in Project Implementation \n9.  The Project started in November 2000 with the recruitment of a consulting firm to assist in \nimplementation.  A  team  of  implementation  advisors  was  fully  mobilized  in  August  2002.  The \nHighlands Region Maintenance Group (HRMG)\u2014consisting of implementation advisors, project \nmanagers  and  maintenance  managers  from  DOW,  and  provincial  works  managers\u2014was \nestablished  to  implement  the  Project.  As  of  April  2006,  the  Project  had  achieved  60%  of \nimplementation and 32% of loan disbursement. Progress in project implementation was rated \nsatisfactory in ADB\u2019s project performance report (PPR). Activities undertaken under the Project \nhave included (i) road upgrading and rehabilitation in five provinces, (ii) RAMS extension, (iii) \ntraining, and (iv) minor rehabilitation contracts. The status of activity implementation is described \nbelow. \n \n10.  Road  Upgrading  and  Rehabilitation.  To  date,  ADB  has  approved  19  subprojects, \ninvolving 249.61 km of road upgrading and 211.41 km of road rehabilitation. Loan 1709-PNG \nfinanced 13 road subprojects, involving 161.41 km of road upgrading and 176.51 km of road \nrehabilitation. The other six subprojects were entirely financed by the Government. As of May \n2006, of 19 road subprojects with 21 contracts, four subprojects had been completed, and seven \ncontracts awarded. Civil works on five roads were in progress, two of which, covering about 31 km, \nwere 90% complete. One contract awaited signing, and the remaining nine contracts were at \nvarious stages of tendering.  \n \n11.  RAMS  Extension  Subproject.  RAMS,  an  integrated  pavement  and  maintenance \nmanagement  system,  is  a  central  planning  instrument  to  support  maintenance  scheduling, \nprioritizing maintenance needs, and preparing budget proposals. It was established in DOW with \n ", "4   \nthe  support  of  two  ADB-funded  technical  assistance  (TA)  projects.5 ADB  approved  a  RAMS \nextension subproject under Loan 1709-PNG in November 2001. The objective of the subproject \nwas to deliver training to enable government counterpart staff to incorporate RAMS as an integral \npart of DOW\u2019s overall asset management system and RAMS to function as a self-sustaining, \nwholly indigenously operated method of planning and budgeting for road maintenance in PNG.  \n \n12.  The international consulting firm that was engaged under the two ADB TA projects6 to \nestablish RAMS nationally and extend it to the provinces was contracted to provide the training \nservices through the direct selection procedure. According to the final report of the consultant, from \nFebruary 2002 to June 2005, (i) 77.5 person-months of consulting services were provided, (ii) over \n50 formal training sessions conducted, and (iii) 700 government officials trained. The scope of the \ntraining included road surveying; data collection; project management in interfacing RAMS with \noperations; prioritizing maintenance needs; and the use of databases, data, and maps. \n   \n13.  Training. The consulting firm engaged to assist in project implementation has provided \nsome training to HRMG counterpart staff members to enhance their technical capability to design \nand manage road projects. From 2001 to 2005, the consulting firm developed a strategic human \nresource development plan and 22 training aids and users\u2019 manuals, and provided 41 training to \n118  government  officials  from  DOW  provincial  offices,  provincial  planning  offices,  and  other \nprovincial offices in the form of on-the-job training or training courses. Training areas included \nengineering  design,  project  management,  financial  management,  contract  administration  and \nconstruction supervision, quality control, road upgrading and maintenance methods, computer \nskills, documentation, and procedures. Improvement in the capacity of counterpart staff in the \nareas of engineering design, contract administration and construction supervision, quality control, \nand computer skills is clearly evident. \n \n14.  Minor Rehabilitation Contracts. Between 2001 and June 2005, HRMG helped DOW and \nprovincial  works  officers  recruit  local  contractors  to  provide  routine  and  emergency  road \nmaintenance in the five Highlands provinces. HRMG reviewed the draft contracts and supervised \nconstruction works. Altogether, 112 projects covering about 1,000 km with a total contract value of \nK21.47 million were completed. In addition, HRMG awarded several community-based contracts to \ncarry out routine maintenance in the region. These civil works contracts provided job opportunities \nto local communities and played an important role in keeping the roads in good condition.  \n \n15.  Compliance with Covenants of Loan 1709-PNG. Most of the covenants of Loan 1709-\nPNG have been complied with. However, two covenants addressing sector issues were only partly \ncomplied with (footnote 6). \n \n                                                 \n5  ADB. 1998. Technical Assistance to Papua New Guinea for the Road Asset Management Project. Manila (TA 3004-\nPNG for $1.0 million); and ADB. 1999. Technical Assistance to Papua New Guinea for the Road Asset Management \nSystem in the Provinces. Manila (TA 3378-PNG for $0.581 million). \n6  Covenant of paragraph 8 of schedule 5 of the loan states: \u201cThe Borrower shall establish, within three months of the \nEffective Date, a road maintenance trust account for each province within the Highlands Region, to be operated in \naccordance with arrangements satisfactory to ADB, and deposit therein each year in total [of] not less than 15 million \nkina in 1999 prices (i.e., three million kina for each province within the Highlands Region) in quarterly payments, \nadjusted in each year for annual inflation, in the following minimum amounts for each quarterly installment: First \nQuarter 20 percent; Second Quarter 30 percent; Third Quarter 30 percent; and Fourth Quarter 20 percent. Covenant of \nparagraph 4a of schedule 5 of the loan states that, by 31 December 2000, the Borrower shall: (a) taking into account \nthe recommendations made under the Cost Recovery TA (i) fully implement, by outsourcing or otherwise, effective \naxle-load testing and control and (ii) establish and commence implementation of an appropriate scale of fines to deter \naxle-overloading and (b) complete installation of an operational weighbridge in Lae in accordance with arrangements \nsatisfactory to ADB.\u201d \n ", "  5\n16.  For the first covenant, it appears that the deadline was not realistic. The provincial trust \naccounts were not established in light of the Government\u2019s efforts to improve fiscal discipline and \nthe potential risk that the funds would be misused. However, sufficient funds have been disbursed \nor allocated by the Government for maintaining the roads. The Government disbursed or allocated \nfrom its budget over K120 million for maintaining roads in the Highlands over the life of the Project. \nThis is more than the K15 million a year initially agreed. The counterpart funds directly required for \nthe approved subprojects have been sufficient. \n \n17.  The second covenant was not complied with in due course, but the following positive \ndevelopments are noteworthy. A proposal for outsourcing was submitted by the consultants in \nJanuary 2003 and is currently being processed by the National Road Authority (NRA) for the bridge \nin Lae, which is the only location identified so far where it has been necessary to have such control \nin place (a management contract reviewed by ADB will soon be submitted to the successful \noperator). The Department of Transport (DOT) has developed a scale of fines to deter axle-\noverloading that is currently under review by NRA. Finally, the weighbridge in Lae is in good \noperating condition. It is also important to note that the Lae bridge facility was not operated by \nDOW, but by DOT initially in 2005  and then by NRA. These developments are consistent with the \npolicy dialogue conducted with ADB on road sector reform. Proceeds from the operations will be \nallocated to the road fund administered by NRA. \n \n18.  Likelihood  of  Achieving  the  Development  Objectives.  Project  implementation  was \nsubstantially delayed in the early years, but it gained momentum in 2004. With a more experienced \nproject implementation officer and lessons learned, the Project is making steady progress and \nhaving a major impact in the Highlands. Clear evidence exists that passenger and freight traffic has \nincreased significantly on the roads completed under Loan 1709-PNG. With more roads completed \none after another in the next 2 years, a major impact on economic and social development in the \nHighlands is expected. The likelihood of achieving development objectives was rated satisfactory \nin the PPR.  \n \n19.  Strengths and Weaknesses of the Project. The Project has a good geographic focus. It \nserves a populous region with great development potential. The objectives of the Project  are in \nline with the Government\u2019s development strategy and its transport sector development strategy. It \naddresses human basic needs and promotes industrial and agricultural activities, exports, tourism, \nincome generation, and social cohesion in the Highlands by facilitating access between production \nareas and market centers. HRMG is experienced and involving a larger number of local technical \nstaff in project design and supervision. This has contributed to capacity development in the road \nsector of the five project provinces, and to retaining that expertise in the provinces. The project \nimplementation start-up delay was partly due to the difficulty of setting up HRMG as a functional \nproject implementation unit. Formal training provided by implementation advisors, combined with \nlearning  by  doing,  has  brought  clear  improvement  in  the  capacity  of  HRMG  in  the  areas  of \nengineering design, contract administration, construction supervision, quality control, and computer \nskills. HRMG\u2019s existence and improved capacity will facilitate implementation of supplementary \nfinancing.  \n \n20.  Lessons  Learned. The design of supplementary financing has taken into account the \nlessons  learned  under  Loan  1709-PNG,  which  are  detailed  in  Appendix  2.  Loan  1709-PNG \nfollowed  the  sector  lending  approach.  Identifying  road  subprojects  and  providing  economic, \nenvironmental, and social justifications, as well as cost estimates, which should have been done at \nthe  project  preparatory  stage,  were  left  until  after  ADB  approved  the  loan.  Identifying  and \napproving each subproject proved to be time-consuming. Procurement followed the two-stage \nbidding process with prequalification, even though the small construction sector in PNG has limited \ncompetition. This resulted in delayed contract awards.   \n ", "6   \n21.  Building on the efforts already made by the Government and the international consulting \nteam, supplementary financing has prioritized 11 roads from 45 subproject pre-investment studies \nand will submit them for ADB one-time approval. Due diligence on technical, economic, financial, \nand environmental viability, and social safeguards, have been completed and scrutinized for all 11 \nroads.  Cost  estimates  were  based  on  the  characteristics  of  the  selected  roads,  types  of \nintervention, quantities required, and realistic unit costs. Procurement will follow the one-stage one-\nevelope  procurement  procedure  with  post-qualification.  A  more  experienced  project \nimplementation  office  is  already  in  place  and  has  been  active  in  project  preparation.  These \nmeasures promise to substantially improve project performance. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED SUPPLEMENTARY FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Proposed Supplementary Financing \n22.  Supplementary financial assistance will provide financing for (i) additional upgrading7 and \nrehabilitation of road sections corresponding to the 11 subprojects, with a total length of 270 km in \nthe five Highlands provinces, and (ii) related consulting services for detailed engineering design, \npreconstruction activities, construction supervision, project performance monitoring and evaluation, \nand  training  on  road  maintenance,  road  safety,  and  STI/HIV/AIDS  prevention.  Eleven  road \nsections8 have been screened and pre-selected for supplementary financing based on various \ncriteria such as (i) their linkage with subprojects already approved by ADB under Loan 1709-PNG, \n(ii)  Government  priorities, 9  (iii)  economic  rate  of  return,  (iv)  social  and  environmental \nconsiderations,  and  (v)  public  consultations.  ADB  conducted  extensive  consultations  with  the \ncentral and provincial governments and local stakeholders on the selection of the road subprojects \nin  November  2005  and  March  2006.  The  names  of  the  provinces,  road  sections,  types  of \ntreatment, and length are shown in Table 2.  \nTable 2:  Prioritized Road Sections \nProvince  Road Section  Length (km)  Treatment \nOkapa\u2013Raipinka  51  Rehabilitation \nKamaliki\u2013Move  34  Rehabilitation \nEastern Highlands  Goroka\u2013Lahame  13  Upgrading \nKindeng\u2013Kondopina  11  Upgrading \nWestern Highlands  Banz\u2013Dona  19  Upgrading \nGewa\u2013Gembogl  21  Rehabilitation \nKerowagi\u2013Dona  29  Rehabilitation \nChimbu  Korinige\u2013Kerowagi  7  Upgrading \nEnga  Warumanda\u2013Laiagam  31  Upgrading \nIalibu\u2013Kagua  32  Rehabilitation \nSouthern Highlands  Ialibu\u2013Pangia  22  Rehabilitation \n           km = kilometer \n           Source: Asian Development Bank. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome  \n \n23.  The impact and outcome of the supplementary financing are in line with those of the Project \nADB approved in 1999. It aims to scale up the Project\u2019s impact on PNG economic development \nand social integration by financing more road sections to (i) improve road access for the private \n                                                 \n7 Upgrading means sealing, without widening and realigning the road.   \n8 All 11 roads are from the long list in the RRP. They are the continuation of the roads financed by Loan 1709-PNG. \n9 The 11 roads were further prioritized from the Government priority list sent in June 2005.   ", "  7\nbusinesses and communities, (ii) reduce their travel costs and time to major commercial and \nservice centers, and (iii) enable them to tap economic and social opportunities in the Highlands. It \nwill support the Government\u2019s efforts to enhance export-led economic growth, generate income for \nlocal communities, and reduce poverty. The outcome will be improved rural access to market \ncenters. \n \nC.  Rationale  \n \n24.  Justifying supplementary financing in this Project are four main points. Firstly, the proceeds \nof Loan 1709-PNG have been fully committed and are able to finance only a total of 338 km \n(consisting of 161.41 km of upgraded road and 176.51 km of rehabilitated road). This length \nconstitutes only 50.4% of the total length of the roads originally targeted (670 km including 220 km \nof  upgraded  road  and  450  km  of  rehabilitated  road).  The  financial  shortfall  was  due  to  a \ncombination of factors, including underestimation of costs at the time of appraisal, delayed project \nimplementation, and lack of competition in PNG\u2019s construction sector. Loan 1709-PNG did not \nbudget any physical and price contingencies. Civil works base cost estimates for some road \nsections were very low. Inflation between 1999 and 2003 was double digit. The delay in project \nimplementation meant actual costs were much higher than envisaged at appraisal, for labor by 5\u20136 \ntimes,  equipment  5\u201330  times,  and  materials  1.8\u20132.9  times.  Lack  of  competition  in  PNG\u2019s \nconstruction sector resulted in high bid prices. The reduced project scope, if not remedied, will \ncertainly  compromise  the  achievement  of  the  intended  purposes  and  objectives  as  initially \nconceived for the Project. With the additional proposed subprojects financed by supplementary \nloans, the total length of roads financed by ADB will reach 608 km (including 242.41 km for \nupgrading and 365.51 km for rehabilitation), enabling achievement of 91% of the original project \nscope. The selected roads are continuations of ongoing road subprojects financed under Loan \n1709-PNG, as indicated in the map, and will increase connectivity. \n \n25.  Secondly, deteriorating transport infrastructure is a particular concern for PNG. Four years \nago, a study completed by the Eastern Highlands Chamber of Commerce and Industry revealed \nthat  poor  road  conditions  caused  an  estimated  30%  decline  in  coffee  shipped  from  Eastern \nHighlands Province. Crime rates also increased as a result of the poor roads, with coffee stolen \nfrom buyers.  \n \n26.  The Government attaches great importance to improving transport infrastructure to achieve \nits overarching development strategy of export-driven economic growth, rural development, and \npoverty reduction. Transport infrastructure rehabilitation and maintenance is the first of seven \nexpenditure  priorities  in  the  Government\u2019s  Medium-Term  Development  Strategy  (2005\u20132010) \n(MTDS). The proposed financing of subprojects is in line with the MTDS and the latest National \nTransport Development Plan 2006\u20132010, the implementation plan for the MTDS. The Highlands \nare indeed strategically important for the country, as they are richly endowed with natural and \ntourism resources and ecological conditions for farming, as well as being home to almost half of \nthe population. Developing the infrastructure network in this region will have significant impact on \nPNG\u2019s  overall  economic  and  social  performance.  The  country\u2019s  most  significant  road,  the \nHighlands Highway, runs through the region, bringing to Lae port copper, coffee, and tea (the \ncountry\u2019s major export items) and distributing in the region imports ranging from heavy machinery \nto  food.  The  Government  has  set  aside  K225  million  for  the  next  4  years  to  upgrade  and \nrehabilitate the Highlands Highway. It is also planning to invest in Lae port and has officially \nrequested ADB assistance in expanding Lae port capacity. It would be timely for ADB to provide \nthe additional financing to upgrade and rehabilitate more roads that connect major farming areas, \nresource  and  population  centers,  and  tourist  sites  in  the  Highlands  region  to  the  Highlands \nHighway. The additional financing will complement efforts by the Government and ADB, particularly \nwith respect to developing Lae port. \n ", "8   \n27.  Thirdly, the proposed supplementary financing is consistent with the ADB country strategy \nfor PNG, as documented in the country strategy and program (CSP) update 2005\u2013200610 and in \ndiscussions on the CSP 2006\u2013201011, currently under preparation. Programming discussions have \nagreed that the transport sector is one of four priority sectors or themes for the upcoming CSP \n2006-2010, with ADB support to focus on the roads and maritime subsectors.   \n \n28.  Fourthly, supplementary financing will be efficient and cost effective in terms of project \npreparation and implementation by capitalizing on the established project implementation office \nand strengthened capability. It has taken more than 2 years for the Project to set up HRMG as a \nfunctional project implementation unit. With on-the-job and formal training provided by international \nconsultants, and learning by doing, HRMG has strengthened its capacity and finally become a fully \nfledged project implementation office consisting of a designing arm and a construction supervision \nteam. It is capable of implementing more subprojects, including engineering design, preparing \nbidding  documents,  tendering  and  awarding  contracts,  and  supervising  construction,  without \nincurring substantial start-up costs. HRMG is currently implementing the Project efficiently. It will \nlikely be able to implement additional proposed subprojects in the same fashion, resulting in start-\nup cost savings of at least $2 million.    \n \n29.  The proposed supplementary financing meets the eligibility criteria specified in the policy \npaper on supplementary financing approved in November 2005. The additional road upgrading and \nrehabilitation subprojects identified for financing by the supplementary loans are within the original \nproject  scope  and  continue  to  be  a  priority  in  the  Government\u2019s  development  strategy. \nSupplementary  financing  will  help  achieve  the  objectives  of  Loan  1709-PNG,  which  were  to \ncontribute to PNG economic development and social integration by improving road infrastructure. \nSupplementary  financing  will  benefit  from  the  established  international  consulting  team,  a \nseasoned project implementation office, and enhanced technical expertise gained from the Project. \nIt is technically feasible, institutionally sound, and economically viable.  \n \nD.  Safeguards \n \n30.  Due diligence has been done to ensure that environmental and social safeguards for the \nselected 11 road subprojects accord with ADB policies. Since the Project involves interventions on \nexisting road alignments, and will not entail land acquisition or involuntary resettlement; it has been \nclassified as category C regarding involuntary resettlement and indigenous people.  \n \n31.  The environmental categorization for the 11 subprojects is category B. Initial environmental \nexaminations (IEEs) were carried out for all 11 roads, and IEE reports for 11 roads and a summary \nIEE  (SIEE)  were  prepared.  According  to  IEEs,  none  of  the  selected  roads  passes  through \nenvironmentally sensitive or conservation area. Most of the adverse environmental impacts are \nrelated to regular construction activities, which are temporary and can be mitigated by taking \nmeasures  detailed  in  the  environmental  management  and  monitoring  plans  (EMMP). \nEnvironmental  impacts  such  as  noise,  reduced  air  quality,  and  traffic  accidents  during  the \noperational  phase  are  considered  low  because  of  the  low  traffic  volume.

Revised Financing Plan  \n \n34.  For supplementary financing, the Government has requested ADB to provide a blend of two \nloans for a total of $53 million, consisting of an OCR loan of $35 million and a loan in various \ncurrencies equivalent to SDR12,075,000 (equivalent to $18 million, as of 1 June 2006) from the \nAsian Development Fund (ADF), to cover the additional project financing need. The OCR loan will \ncarry a term of 24 years, with a grace period of 4 years, an interest rate determined in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.75% per annum, and such \nother terms and conditions as set forth in the draft OCR loan. The Government has provided ADB \nwith (i) the reasons for its decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility on the \nbasis of these terms and conditions, and (ii) an undertaking that these choices were its own \nindependent decision not relying on any communication or advice from ADB. The ADF loan will \nhave a maturity of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years, an interest charge of 1% per \nannum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter, equal amortization, and such other \nterms and conditions as set forth in the draft ADF loan. ADF and OCR loans will be disbursed on a \npro rata basis (Appendix 4). \n \n35.  ADB will finance 68% of the total cost of the additional road subprojects in the Project, while \nthe  Government  will  provide  $25.07  million  equivalent  to  finance  the  remaining  cost.12 The \nfinancing plan is presented in Appendix 3 and summarized in Table 5.  \n \nTable 5: Financing Plan for Proposed Subprojects \n($ million) \nSource      Total Cost  Percentage\nAsian Development Bank   53.00 68 \n   OCR  35.00    45 \n   ADF  18.00    23 \nGovernment  25.07    32 \nTotal  78.07 100 \n      ADF = Asian Development Fund, OCR = ordinary capital resources. \n    Source: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n36.  The use of ADF financing is justified by ADB\u2019s country classification for PNG and PNG\u2019s \nsocial and economic status. As ADB\u2019s current country classification stands, PNG is a category B2 \ncountry whose limited debt repayment capacity entitles it to limited ADF financing.  \n \n37.  A World Bank assessment13 found that the incidence of poverty in PNG had increased \nsignificantly in recent years. Using a poverty line that allows for 2,200 calories per adult equivalent \nper day and an allowance for basic nonfood expenditure, which is similar to the PNG national \npoverty line, 37.5% of the PNG population was considered poor in 1996. This figure had risen to \n54% in 2003. The trend was the same for the international poverty line of $1 per day, by which the \nestimated incidence of poverty had grown from 25% to 40%. In terms of the human development \nindex, PNG ranked 133 out of 177 countries in 2004. Its social indicators are among the lowest in \nthe Pacific region. The Highlands, home to the highest portion of the poor, are mountainous and \ngeologically unstable, with torrential rains that can last 6 or 7 months. Road construction and \nmaintenance are costly, requiring concessional funding.  \n                                                 \n12 Budgeted  in  the  Government\u2019s  development  budget  as  a  separate  line  item.  The  Government  has  provided \ncounterpart funding for Loan 1709-PNG. With its improved financial position, the Government is willing and able to \nprovide the counterpart funding for the supplementary financing subprojects.   \n13 World Bank. 2004.

Implementation Arrangements \n \n1.  Executing Agency, Project Implementation Unit, and Project Steering \nCommittee \n \n39.  DOW will continue as the Executing Agency. HRMG, assisted by a team of international \nand local consultants, will continue as the project implementation unit. HRMG headed by a field \nproject manager will maintain an office in each province, comprising an implementation advisor, a \ncommunity relations officer, and other necessary staff. HRMG will  \n(i)  design the subprojects and prepare the bidding documents,  \n(ii)  handle the bidding process, \n(iii)  provide construction supervision and manage contracts, \n(iv)  monitor the project progress, \n(v)  prepare withdrawal applications, \n(vi)  maintain project accounts and complete the financial records for auditing, \n(vii)  prepare project progress reports and the project completion report, \n(viii)  monitor environmental and socioeconomic impacts, \n(ix)  implement a cost-effective contracting-out system for road maintenance and so \nensure the roads completed under Loan 1709-PNG and supplementary loans are \nproperly maintained, and \n(x)  provide training on road maintenance, road safety, and STI/HIV/AIDS prevention.  \nThe project steering committee will continue to ensure close interagency coordination and monitor \nimplementation of the Project. Its composition and mode of functioning will not change.  \n \n2.   Implementation Period  \n \n40.  The proposed subprojects will be implemented over 3.5 years, with civil works commencing \nin April 2007 and project completion by the end of 2009. The detailed implementation schedule is \nattached as Appendix 5. The project completion date for Loan 1709-PNG will be extended to 31 \nDecember 2009 to accommodate the proposed subprojects under the supplementary loans.   \n \n3.   Procurement  \n \n41.  Procurement of civil works under the supplementary loans will follow ADB\u2019s Procurement \nGuidelines. Civil works will be divided into 16 contract packages as listed in the procurement plan \n(Appendix 6). Since the procurement threshold for PNG is $3 million, five of the packages will be \nprocured under national competitive bidding (NCB) without excluding foreign contractors and joint \nventures, and 11 will be procured under international competitive bidding (ICB). Single-stage one- \n ", "12  \nevelope bidding procedure with post-qualification will be used for both ICB and NCB contract \npackages to streamline the bidding process. Contractors with adequate technical and financial \ncapacity will be allowed to bid for several packages and may be awarded more than one contract \nbased on the least-cost combination of contracts.  \n \n   4.   Consulting Services \n \n42.  International consulting services will be required to assist in (i) detailed engineering design, \n(ii) preconstruction activities, (iii) construction supervision, (iv) project performance monitoring and \nevaluation, and (v) training on road maintenance and safety and on STI/HIV/AIDS prevention. \nUnder Loan 1709-PNG, an international consulting firm (the initial consultant) was recruited on a \ncompetitive basis to assist in project design and implementation, construction supervision, and \ntraining. As Loan 1709-PNG followed a sector approach, the initial consultant has helped HRMG \ncomplete pre-investment studies on more than 45 subprojects for ADB consideration, including the \nproposed 11 road sections. Engineering design, preparing bidding documents, and implementing \nroad subprojects financed by supplementary loans are tasks that represent a natural continuation \nof the previous work carried out by the initial consultant.  \n \n43.  After years of working in the Highlands, the initial consultant has acquired knowledge about \nthe PNG road sector, the local culture, and the topographic and geotechnical conditions of the \nstudied  subprojects.  Continuity  in  technical  approach,  experience  acquired,  and  continued \nprofessional  liability  necessitates  continuing  the  initial  consultant\u2019s  services.  The  project \nimplementation schedule in Appendix 5 assumes that the existing institutional arrangements for \nproject implementation, including the services of the initial consultant, will be maintained. From the \ncost perspective, retaining the services of the initial consultant will save at least $2 million in \nconsulting services, because its current contract will end in June 2008, and will only need to be \nextended by 1.5 years.  \n \n44.  Recruiting  a  new  consultant  has  been  considered  and  found  impractical.  Firstly,  the \nselection  process  would  take  at  least  6  months.  Secondly,  consultant  mobilization  may  take \nanother 1\u20132 years, as happened in this Project and others in PNG. Thirdly, engineering design and \nbidding for civil works will take another year. This means that initial implementation delays under \nLoan 1709-PNG will be repeated under the supplementary loans if new recruitment is conducted.  \n \n45.  In summary, retaining the services of the initial consultant observes ADB\u2019s principles of \neconomy and efficiency. Hence, the single-source selection method for the continuation of the \ninitial consultant is proposed for the international consulting services. It is proposed that the initial \nconsultant\u2019s  contract  be  extended  by  1.5  years  (132  person-months),  from  June  2008  until \nDecember 2009. The Borrower will ask the initial consultant to prepare technical and financial \nproposals on the basis of the outline terms of reference presented in Appendix 7.  \n \n46.  Domestic consulting services for project design, construction supervision, financial auditing, \nand training on road maintenance, road safety, and STI/HIV/AIDS prevention for the Project will be \nrequired and financed by the Government. The Government will recruit the domestic consultants \nfollowing Government procedures acceptable to ADB.   \n   \n5.  Advance Procurement Action \n47.  The Government requested ADB\u2019s approval of advance procurement action for recruiting \nconsulting services and procuring civil works. Approval of advance action was granted during the \nmanagement review meeting. Advance action covers inviting bids, bidding, and bid evaluation but \nnot awarding contracts. Advance action will be undertaken in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement ", " 13\nGuidelines and Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. The Government has been advised that \napproval of advance action does not commit ADB to financing the Project. \n6.  Disbursement Arrangements \n48.  Supplementary  loans  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement \nHandbook.  Direct  payment  and  reimbursement  procedures  will  be  used  for  road  subprojects \nfinanced by the supplementary loans.  \n7.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n49.  Recent experience indicates that financial management with regard to accounting, auditing, \nand reporting is satisfactory and does not require adjustment. DOW will continue to maintain \nseparate  accounts  to  identify  civil  works  and  services  financed  by  Loan  1709-PNG  and \nsupplementary loans, prepare separate financial statements indicating the sources and application \nof funds, and have them audited by an independent auditor acceptable to ADB. Financial auditing \nhas been budgeted under the Project and will be funded by the Government. The audited project \naccounts and the auditor\u2019s reports will be provided to ADB in English within 6 months after the end \nof each financial year. DOW will prepare and submit to ADB quarterly project progress reports and \nprovide to ADB a project completion report within 3 months of project completion. \n8.   Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation  \n50.  ADB and the Government will agree, prior to April 2007, upon a set of indicators for \nmonitoring  and  evaluating  project performance  and  the performance  of  each  road  subproject \nfinanced  by  Loan  1709-PNG  and  supplementary  loans  in  relation  to  the  Project\u2019s  goals  and \npurposes, with an emphasis on economic and social activities. Six person-months of international \nconsulting services will be provided under the Project to establish and monitor indicators and \nevaluate project performance. The consultant will  \n(i)  establish a set of social and poverty impact indicators for the Project and gender-\ndisaggregated  baseline  data  for  road  sections  whose  civil  works  have  not \ncommenced; \n(ii)  review and compare the data during project implementation and completion; \n(iii)  monitor and evaluate ongoing and completed road sections; \n(iv)  prepare subproject completion reports; \n(v)  provide hands-on training on data collection and monitoring to DOW; and \n(vi)  assess the overall socioeconomic impacts of the Project. The indicators may include \n(a) economic  activities  and  income  level  in  the  project  area,  (b) industrial  and \nagricultural outputs, (c) transport costs and time, (d) transport services and charges, \n(e) accident rates, (f) level of social services including school enrollment and infant \nmortality, (g) access to STI/HIV/AIDS information and service, and (h) jobs created \n(employment impact indicators will include information about unskilled laborers, poor \nlaborers, and women laborers). \n \n9.  Project Review \n \n51.  ADB will review the Project every 6 months. Each review will cover all relevant aspects that \nmay have an impact on the Project\u2019s performance and continuing viability, either institutional, \nadministrative, organizational, technical, environmental, social, economic, the status of compliance \nwith covenants stipulated in each loan, financial, or other aspects.  \n \n \n \n ", "14  \n10.  Anticorruption Measures \n \n52.  ADB has recently completed a project procurement-related audit of the Project and found \nno clear indications of potential fraud and corruption. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998) was \nexplained to the Government and DOW and discussed with them. The Government and DOW shall \nadhere  to  ADB  anticorruption  requirements  during  project  implementation.  Consistent  with  its \ncommitment to good governance, accountability, and transparency, ADB reserves the right to \ninvestigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive \npractices  relating  to  the  Project.  To  support  these  efforts,  relevant  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s \nAnticorruption  Policy  are  included  in  the  loan  regulations  and  the bidding  documents  for  the \nProject. In particular, all contracts financed by ADB in connection with the Project shall include \nprovisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and examine the records and accounts of DOW and \nall contractors, suppliers, consultants and other service providers as they relate to the Project. If \nADB  determines  that  representatives  of  the  Borrower,  a  beneficiary,  a  contractor,  and/or  a \nconsultant engaged in corrupt, fraudulent, collusive or coercive practices, ADB may take the \nfollowing actions: (i) reject any proposal for contract award and/or (ii) declare any firm or individual \nineligible for ADB-financed contracts, indefinitely or for a stated period of time. \n \n \nIV.  PROPOSED SUPPLEMENTARY FINANCING BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n \nA.  Benefits \n53.  The proposed supplementary financing will generate substantial economic benefits. Normal \ntraffic  growth  rates  were  based  on  the  projected  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  growth  rate \nestimated to be 3% annually for 2006\u20132025. Additional traffic is generated either because a \njourney  becomes  more  attractive  by  virtue  of  its  costing  less  or  because  of  the  increased \ndevelopment brought about by the improved roads. For all selected road sections to be improved, \nthe generated traffic is assumed to equal 5% of normal traffic that would occur during the first year \nafter  rehabilitation  works  end.  This  assumption  is  made  based  on  the  presence  of  intense \nagricultural activities in the 11 identified project areas. \n \n54.  The economic analysis was carried out for the 11 subprojects by comparing scenarios with \nand without the Project using the highway design and management model. The economic analysis \ncovers 20 years (2006\u20132025) for the upgrade-to-sealed option and 15 years (2006\u20132020) for re-\ngravelling, with the construction periods varying between 1 and 2 years starting in 2007. All \nbenefits and costs are in constant 2006 prices. All prices are expressed in PNG kina. \n \n55.  The economic costs of all the subprojects proposed for financing under the supplementary \nloans are (i) the capital cost, including labor, equipment and materials, consulting services and \nphysical contingency, and (ii) the costs of maintaining project roads. The economic benefits arise \nfrom (i) savings in vehicle operating cost, particularly repair costs, from improved road conditions; \n(ii) savings in maintenance costs; (iii) time savings for road users; and (iv) benefits to generated \ntraffic. The subprojects proposed for financing under the Project will also have other benefits, such \nas improving food security and access to economic and social services, which were not included in \nthe economic internal rate of return (EIRR) calculation.  \n \n56.  Using a 12% discount rate, the economic benefits are substantial. The net present value is \n$56.89  million,  and  the  EIRR  is  18.8%.  The  results  of  the  sensitivity  analysis  confirmed  the ", " 15\neconomic viability of all proposed subprojects. The switching value14 for increased rehabilitation \ncosts was determined to be 42.5%, and the switching value for decreased benefits 29.9%. In the \nworst-case  scenario,  with  a  combination  of  increased  costs  and  decreased  benefits,  the  net \npresent value would be reduced to K8.16 million, and the EIRR to 12.91%. The detailed economic \nanalysis is attached in Appendix 8. \n \n57.  According to a recent assessment by the International Monetary Fund,15 PNG\u2019s economy \nhas been performing well since 2004. Real GDP grew by 3% in 2004, and a similar growth rate is \nexpected for 2005. A sharp reduction in inflation occurred in 2004, and inflation is estimated to \nhave averaged 1% in 2005. External accounts are expected to be in surplus in 2005. Fiscal \noutcome also improved in 2005, with a budget deficit of 0.6%. As a result, public sector debt, about \nhalf of which is external, shrank from 72% of GDP in 2002 to 49% in 2005. The Government is \ncontinuing to rationalize public expenditure with the objective of controlling debt while increasing \nexpenditure on priority areas such as transport infrastructure. Counterpart funding for ADB projects \nis treated as a priority and has been provided to Loan 1709-PNG. Budget allocation for road \nmaintenance has increased substantially from K15 million\u2013K20 million to K100 million in 2006. The \nroad fund has been established with an initial allocation of $20 million from the fuel tax. In view of \nthese developments, the Project is considered to be financially sustainable.  \nB.   Poverty Reduction Impact \n \n58.  The proposed subprojects financed under the Project will contribute to alleviating poverty in \nthe  Highlands  by  providing  job  opportunities  and  promoting  agricultural  development  through \nimproved  road  access.  Upgrading  and  rehabilitating  the  11  roads  will  directly  generate  an \nestimated  1,500  local  employment  opportunities.  The  maintenance  program  for  the  roads \ncompleted under the Project will provide additional income opportunities for 6,000 people.  \n59.  PNG\u2019s economy is highly dualistic, with a small modern sector coexisting with a large \nsubsistence  sector.  More  than  85%  of  the  population  resides  in  rural  areas,  surviving  by \nsubsistence agriculture and/or cash crop production. The Highlands are fertile but have the highest \nincidence of poverty because residents are isolated from market and social service centers. The 11 \nproposed road sections connect the Highlands\u2019 major coffee, fruit, and vegetable production areas \nto the Highlands Highway and city centers, serving a population of more than 600,000. Improved \nand rehabilitated roads will help farmers increase their income from cash crops by easing access  \nto markets and reducing costs for traders collecting produce, as well as by allowing farmers to tap \nmarket opportunities in city centers. The increased income and improved road conditions will \nfacilitate access to education and health services in city centers, thereby contributing to the well-\nbeing of the population.  \nC.   Social and Gender Impact \n60.  The social and gender impacts of the subprojects to be financed under the Project were \nassessed during the ADB Fact-Finding Mission, and a summary of the poverty reduction and social \nstrategy appears in Appendix 9. It was found that women in the Highlands are currently involved in \na  broad  range  of  activities  related  to  road  construction,  road  maintenance,  and  commercial \nroadside services. The proposed subprojects will provide more income-earning opportunities for \nwomen. An estimated 25\u201330% of the workforce for the Project will be women. \n                                                 \n14 The switching value shows the percentage increase in a cost variable (or decline in a benefit variable) required for the \nnet present value to become zero, which is the same as the EIRR reducing to the cut-off level of 12%. \n15 International Monetary Fund. 2006. IMF Concludes 2005 Article IV Consultation with Papua New Guinea. Washington, \nDC. \n ", "16  \n61.  The presence of the construction workforce at subproject sites and the opening up of \nisolated areas may expose the local population to STI/HIV/AIDS risk. The proposed Project will \nfinance training and awareness campaigns in each province and require contractors, through civil \nworks contracts, to take preventive measures to mitigate the risk. Other than the STI/HIV/AIDS \nissue, no adverse impacts on vulnerable groups and indigenous people were identified. \nD.   Environmental Impacts \n62.  The  proposed  subprojects  under  the  Project  have  been  categorized  as  environmental \ncategory B project in accordance with the ADB Environment Policy (2002) and Environmental \nAssessment Guidelines (2003). Environmental assessment has been carried out for all 11 road \nsections.  IEE  reports  and  EMMP  have  been  prepared  and  agreed  with  the  Government.  A \nsummary initial environmental examination is in Appendix 10. \n \n63.  Various consultations, a review of documents, and field assessments of the proposed road \nsections lead to the conclusion that significant and/or irreversible impacts are unlikely and that the \n11 road sections comply with ADB's Environment Policy. In particular, the proposed road sections \nare not located in environmentally sensitive or conservation areas. Road improvement will not \nincrease logging or hunting and are strongly supported and requested by local communities. No \nsignificant  cumulative  impacts  are  identified.  Moreover,  the  proposed  roadwork  is  limited  to \nrehabilitating or upgrading existing roads and can generally be carried out within the existing road \nreserve. \n \n64.  As summarized in EMMP, which will be part of the contractors\u2019 subcontract, all potential \nenvironmental concerns can properly be mitigated and minimized to acceptable levels. As such, \nthe scope of the rehabilitation and upgrading of the proposed road sections and their anticipated \nenvironmental impacts do not require further study. The supporting EMMP will provide sufficient \nguidance  for  HRMG  staff  to  successfully  monitor  and  report  on  the  Project\u2019s  environmental \ncompliance.  \n \nE.   Project Risks \n \n65.  The subprojects to be financed under the Project are subject to the usual risks of transport \nprojects. These include project start-up delay, road sustainability, environmental impacts, and \nSTI/HIV/AIDS exposure. The design of the Project has taken into account these risks and includes \nmitigating measures. To minimize project implementation delay, all 11 road subprojects have been \nscreened,  and  due  diligence  has  been  completed.  The  existing  institutional  arrangements, \nincluding consulting services for project implementation, will be maintained to ensure continuity \nand avoid disruptions. Detailed engineering design and the preparation of bidding documents are \nunder way and will be finalized during project implementation. Procurement of civil works will follow \na  single-stage  one-evelope  bidding  procedure  with  post-qualification  in  order  to  expedite  the \nprocurement bidding process. With all the measures proposed above, completion of the Project will \nlikely be by the end of 2009, as indicated in the detailed implementation schedule.   \n66.  The issue of road sustainability has been extensively discussed by ADB missions and the \nGovernment  during  project  processing  and  has  been  addressed  in  the  Project.  HRMG  will \nimplement a contracting-out system to engage local communities or contractors to provide routine \nand periodic maintenance for ADB-financed roads so that the life of the completed roads can be \nextended. Road maintenance will be contracted out starting in 2007. An assurance is included to \nensure that the Government will maintain the road sections funded by Loan 1709-PNG and the \nsupplementary loans.  ", " 17\n67.  Environmental  impacts  during  construction  will  be  mitigated  by  DOW\u2019s  implementing \nEMMP, which include the obligation to incorporate mitigation measures into civil works contracts, \nand by monitoring these contracts. Monitoring results will be reflected in project progress reports. \nThe impact of STI/HIV/AIDS will be mitigated by incorporating appropriate conditions in civil works \ncontracts that require contractors to adopt preventive measures, supplemented by training and \nawareness campaigns financed by the Project. The preventive measures undertaken under each \nroad section will be monitored and reflected in the project progress reports, which will be submitted \nto the National AIDS Council and the Country Coordinating Mechanism.  Assurance has also been \ngiven by the Government with respect to health standards.  \n \nV.  ASSURANCES \n \nA.  Specific Assurances \n \n68.

The  Road  Maintenance  and  Upgrading  (Sector)  Project 1  (Loan  1709-PNG)  was \napproved  on  16  November  1999  and  became  effective  on  15  February  2000.  The  main \ncomponent of Loan 1709-PNG was to upgrade 220 km of roads and rehabilitate 450 km. To \ndate, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) has approved 19 road subprojects involving 21 \ncontract packages for upgrading 249.61 km of roads and rehabilitating 211.41 km. Thirteen of \nthe subprojects are financed from Loan 1709-PNG, and six of them are financed entirely by the \nGovernment. As of May 2006, four subprojects involving 39.8 km of roads had been fully \ncompleted, and seven contract packages had been awarded.  Civil works of five subprojects \nwere in progress (two of which are 90% completed), one contract awaited signing, and the \nremaining nine were at various stages of tendering.  \n \n2.  Project implementation has three stages: (i) road subproject identification and approval, \n(ii) procurement of civil works, and (ii) construction.  \n \n3.   At the first stage, establishing the project implementation unit proved difficult because of \nthe challenging work environment in Papua New Guinea (PNG) and the scarcity of qualified and \navailable human resources. An international consulting firm engaged in November 2000 to \nstrengthen project implementation and maintenance management was mobilized in January \n2001.  Frequent  withdrawal  and  replacement  of  the  consultants,  including  the  chief \nimplementation advisor, occurred due to (i) the long visa application process, (ii) concerns over \nsecurity  and  living  conditions  in  the  country,  and  (iii)  health  and  family  reasons.  The \nimplementation consulting team was fully mobilized in August 2002 and has been stable ever \nsince. In addition, the Government required a long time to appoint qualified fulltime staff to \nhandle the key positions in the Highlands Region Maintenance Group and provide office space. \nAnother difficulty was identifying the road subprojects and obtaining ADB approval. Under the \nsector lending approach, the borrower or the excuting agency (EA) is primarily responsible for \nidentifying,  prioritizing,  formulating,  appraising,  approving,  and  implementing  subprojects  in \naccordance  with  technical,  financial,  and  economic  appraisal  criteria,  including  social  and \nenvironmental criteria, mutually agreed between ADB and the borrower/EA.2 Between 2001 and \n2005, the Government sent about 45 subproject proposals, and ADB approved 19. Most of the \nsubprojects were approved by ADB in 2004 (nine approvals) and 2005 (five). From 2000 to \n2003, only five road subprojects had been approved by ADB, and 2003 saw no approvals.  \n \n4.  In the second stage, the Project experienced delays caused by the time-consuming two-\nstage international competitive bidding process and the slowness of the Government\u2019s approval \nprocedures. Of the 13 ADB-financed civil works contracts, 11 went through a prequalification \nstage. The average duration for prequalification was about 9 months, and from prequalification \nor post-qualification to contract award, the average duration for the 10 contracts was 20.5 \nmonths.  Pursuant to the Government\u2019s rules, any contract valued above K10 million (equivalent \nto $3.2 million) requires the approval of the National Executive Council (the national Cabinet) \nupon recommendation of the Central Supply and Tenders Board. This process caused delay in \nawarding contracts. Under Loan 1709-PNG, securing Government approval of contract awards  \nhas taken 2 to 9 months.  \n  \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 1999.

In the construction stage, road upgrading and rehabilitation have suffered from the \ndifficult law and order situation in the Highlands, particularly in Southern Highlands, Enga, and \nWestern Highlands provinces. For example, shooting and killing in Western Highlands Province \nin November 2005 forced the contractors to stop civil works for 3 weeks. \n \n6.   Several lessons can be drawn. First, for a fragile state such as PNG, ADB could have \nsupported the Government more in preparing the subprojects by helping it to (i) prioritize some \ninvestments; (ii) conduct technical feasibility studies and financial, environmental, and social \ndue diligence; and (iii) prepare the technical design and bidding documents. Secondly, ADB \nshould have supported the Government in mobilizing the core team for project implementation \nat an earlier stage to minimize the delay in starting the project. Thirdly, procurement of civil \nworks  could  have  followed  a  one-stage  bidding  process  with  post-qualification,  as  the \nconstruction sector in PNG has limited competition. Lastly, ADB needs to strengthen its policy \ndialogue with the Government, aiming to simplify the latter\u2019s approval process for awarding \ncontracts.  \n \n7.   Although the Project experienced substantial delays in implementation start-up, it is \nnoteworthy that ADB is a major actor in the Highlands, playing a key role in promoting economic \nand social development by restoring and maintaining the road system. Recently, a large ground-\nbreaking ceremony for the Mendi\u2013Nipa road section, financed by Loan 1709-PNG, was held in \nSouthern Highlands Province. The provincial governor chaired the ceremony, attended by the \nminister and secretary of works, vice minister of finance and treasury, acting attorney general, \nADB  representative,  and  an  unprecedented  crowd  of  about  70,000  villagers.  Popular  and \ngovernmental support for the road was impressive and encouraging. \n \n8.   Furthermore,  the  Project  has  gained  momentum  since  2004  and  is  progressing \nsatisfactorily,  with  major  contracts  awarded  and  civil  works  in  progress.  The  turnaround \noccurred in November 2003, when the ADB Review Mission agreed with DOW on steps to take \nto  speed  the  approval  of  subproject  proposals  and  procurement.  As  a  result,  nine  road \nsubprojects were approved in 2004, and five in 2005. Two contracts were awarded in 2004, \nthree in 2005, and two in 2006. Impressed by the solid progress of the Project, the Government \nhas committed K91 million to fully finance five other road subprojects in the Highlands region.  \n \n9.   Supplementary financing is an efficient means to capture this momentum to increase \nlocal road connectivity and so support the Government\u2019s development strategy of economic \ngrowth, income generation, and poverty reduction. It builds on efforts already made by the \nGovernment and international consulting team, and on the efficiency of the current, experienced \nproject  implementation  unit.  It  streamlines  ADB  processing  without  compromising  its \nenvironmental, resettlement, and social safeguard polices.  \n \n10.  The design of supplementary financing takes into account the lessons learned from Loan \n1709-PNG.  From  45  subproject  pre-investment  studies,  11  road  subprojects  have  been \nprioritized and scrutinized, and will be submitted for ADB one-time approval. Due diligence in \nline  with  ADB  environmental  and  social  safeguard  policies  has  been  completed  for  these \nsubprojects, and economic justification for each of them provided. Subproject technical design \nand the preparation of bidding documents are already making good progress. Cost estimates \nwere  based  on  the  characteristics  of  the  selected  roads,  types  of  intervention,  quantities \nrequired, and realistic unit costs. Procurement will follow a one-stage one-evelope procedure \nwith post-qualification. An experienced project implementation office is already in place and will \nimplement the Project. These measures promise to improve project performance substantially.

Based on Papua New Guinea\u2019s existing vehicle fleet, the following vehicle types have \nbeen taken into account  for the traffic analysis: (i) cars, (ii) pickups, (iii) buses and large public \nmotor vehicles (PMVs), (iv) light trucks, (v) medium trucks (three axles), (vi) heavy trucks (four \naxles), and (vii) articulated trucks (six axles). The main features of each vehicle type are \ndetailed in Table A8.1. \n \n2.  Traffic surveys were conducted on the proposed project road sections as a basis for \ndetermining average daily traffic. Seasonal patterns were used to obtain annualized average \ndaily traffic and adopted as normal traffic for 2006 (Table A8.1) \n \n3.  The analysis of traffic distribution as detailed in the same table shows that cars and \nbuses represent 40% of the total traffic, and pickups and trucks contribute equally to make up \nthe remaining 60%.  \nTable A8.1: Annualized Average Daily Traffic \nCategories of Vehicles  Annualized \nBuses  Average \nSubproject Road Sections \nPick- and  Light  Medium  Heavy  Articulated  Daily  \nCars  ups  PMV  Trucks  Trucks  Trucks  Trucks  Traffic \n82  136  6  116  0  0  0  340\nRypinka\u2013Okapa 1 and 2  24%  40%  2%  34%  0%  0%  0%  100%\n59  257  149  30  0  0  0  495\nGoroka\u2013Lahame  12%  52%  30%  6%  0%  0%  0%  100%\n49  118  47  47  29  0  0  290\nKamaliki\u2013Move 1 and2  17%  41%  16%  16%  10%  0%  0%  100%\n178  99  30  134  54  0  0  495\nKindeng\u2013Kondopena  21%  37%  21%  17%  4%  0%  0%  100%\n233  165  147  56  13  0  0  614\nBanz\u2013Dona 1 and 2  38%  27%  24%  9%  2%  0%  0%  100%\n101  66  58  130  28  8  0  391\nGewa\u2013Gembogle  26%  17%  15%  33%  7%  2%  0%  100%\n127  71  21  96  39  0  0  354\nKerowagi\u2013Dona  36%  20%  6%  27%  11%  0%  0%  100%\n100  66  58  128  38  8  0  398\nKeronige\u2013Kerowagi  26%  17%  15%  33%  7%  2%  0%  100%\n257  214  13  0  79  30  19  612\nWarumanda\u2013Laiagam 1 and 2  42%  35%  2%  0%  13%  5%  3%  100%\n151  60  19  110  34  4  0  378\nIalibu\u2013Kagua 1 and 2  40%  16%  5%  29%  9%  1%  0%  100%\n77  99  44  96  52  0  0  368\nIalibu\u2013Pangia  21%  27%  12%  26%  14%  0%  0%              100%\nPMV = public motor vehicle. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n \n ", "  Appendix 8  37\n2.  Traffic Forecast \n \n4.  Normal traffic growth rates were based on the projected gross domestic product growth \nrate and estimated to be 3% per year for 2006\u20132025. Additional traffic is generated either \nbecause a journey becomes more attractive by virtue of its costing less or because of increased \ndevelopment brought about by the improved roads. For all sections, the generated traffic was \nassumed to equal 5% of normal traffic that would occur during the first year after rehabilitation \nworks end.

Economic Evaluation \n \n1.  General \n \n6.  The  economic  analysis  was  carried  out  for  the  11  subproject  roads  by  comparing \nscenarios with and without the Project using the highway design and management model. The \neconomic analysis covers 20 years (2006\u20132025) for the upgrade-to-sealed option and 15 years \n(2006\u20132020) for re-gravelling, with construction periods of between 1 and 2 years starting in \n2007. All benefits and costs are in constant 2005 prices. All prices are expressed in PNG kina. \n \n7.  In the scenario without the Project, the 11 subproject road sections are assumed to \nreceive a minimum of maintenance to keep them at an average roughness measuring 16 on the \nInternational Roughness Index (IRI). The scenario with the Project includes routine and periodic \nmaintenance.  \n \n8.  During project preparation, two improvement options were considered, namely upgrade-\nto-sealed  and  re-gravelling,  to  determine  which  would  be  the  more  cost-effective.  In  the \nscenario  with  the  Project,  the  average  roughness  would  decrease  to  about  4.5  IRI  after \nupgrading to sealed and would keep road surface roughness below 7 IRI. In the re-gravelling \noption,  the  average  roughness  of  the  road  would  be  reduced  to  6.5  IRI,  and  proposed \nmaintenance would keep road surface roughness below 10 IRI. \n \n  2.  Costs \n \n9.  Project  economic  costs  include  the  financial  roadwork  costs  in  terms  of  materials, \nequipment, labor, and consulting services. Taxes and duties are excluded. Costs were divided \ninto tradable and nontradable components. A standard conversion factor of 0.95 has been used \nto revalue goods and services at world prices into PNG kina, and a shadow wage rate factor of \n0.5  has  been  applied  to  local  unskilled  labor  to  account  for  local  unemployment  and \nunderemployment. These factors have been applied to capital and maintenance costs, as well \nas to vehicle operating and passenger time costs. \n \n3.  Benefits \n \n10.  Benefits are substantial from the 11 subproject roads because they have relatively high \ntraffic usage due to active agricultural and commercial sectors, and because they are in poor or \nvery poor condition. The main benefits are savings in vehicle operating costs and time for road \nusers, and in maintenance costs. \n \n11.  Vehicle operating costs include the costs of (i) replacing spare parts, (ii) gas and diesel, \n(iii) lubricating oil, (iv) maintenance labor, and (v) crew wages. We used project economic costs \nas inputs to the analysis. \n \n12.  The value of time in the economic analysis is derived from two components: (i) working \ntime and (ii) nonworking time. The value of working time during productive hours was derived \nfrom the average per capita income of K2,300. Assuming a 48-hour work week and 48 weeks of \nwork per year, the value of a working hour used in the analysis was K1.00. Nonworking time \nwas valued at a quarter of working time. This rate was used for bus and PMV passengers only. \nThe rate was doubled for passengers in cars and pickups.  \n \n ", "  Appendix 8  39\n  4.  Results of Economic Analysis \n \n13.

No    No  \n \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in Papua New Guinea: \n \nAlthough Papua New Guinea (PNG) does not exhibit the widespread abject poverty present in some other developing \nmember countries (DMCs), World Bank projections (2005) show the proportion of poor living under the national poverty \nline at 53% in 2003, compared with 37.5% in the benchmark year of 1996. PNG\u2019s human development index has \nimproved since the mid-1970s but only very slowly. In 2005, PNG ranked 137, reflecting alarming economic and social  \ndisparities in the country. On the United Nations Development Programme poverty index, PNG ranks 68 among \ndeveloping countries. PNG's main social indicators, such as life expectancy and maternal and child mortality rates, are \nstill well below the averages for lower middle-income countries. PNG has limited primary healthcare. Infectious disease \nclaims many lives, and there are serious public health risks from endemic diseases such as malaria and a generalized \nHIV/AIDS epidemic. In education, the rate of participation in primary schooling is improving, but it remains lower than in \nmost other countries in the region. \n \nPNG has an abundance of natural resources including (i) large reserves of minerals, (ii) extensive forestry and fishery \nassets, (iii) significant potential for agricultural expansion, and (iv) many locations with potential for ecological and \ncultural  tourism.  Despite  the  potential  of  these  resources,  PNG's  economic  performance  has  fallen  short  of \nexpectations. Economic growth has not kept pace with population growth, and performance varies considerably from \nyear to year. Most of the population lives in rural communities with traditional village structures and depend on \nsubsistence farming supplemented by cash crops. Only 15\u201320% live in the main urban areas of Port Moresby, Lae, \nMadang, Mt. Hagan, and Goroka. PNG has a relatively small dual economy, formal and informal. The formal economy \nis dominated by large-scale resource projects, particularly in mining and petroleum, and provides a large proportion of \ngovernment revenue. However, the formal sector employs only around 15% of the workforce, with the informal \neconomy supporting the remaining 85%, mostly through semi-subsistence agriculture. \n \nThe impact of road construction on poverty reduction can be measured in terms of (i) increased access for rural \ncommunities to basic social services such as education and healthcare and local markets; (ii) increased employment \nopportunities for unskilled laborers in the project area; (iii) indirect and induced economic growth in the project-affected \nregions and the nation as a whole; and (iv) anticipated reductions in transportation costs to road passengers, freight \nusers, and vehicle operators. Local communities clearly perceive that the poor condition of the prioritized road sections \nto be funded under the supplementary loans is a major factor retarding their economic and social development. Most of \nthe roads are now so poor that the availability of both public and private means of transport along them has declined so \nfar that most people can no longer regularly access services and markets in urban centers. There is no doubt that \nimproving these roads would greatly facilitate access to a wider range of services and stimulate economic activity, \nespecially cash cropping, and thus directly contribute to alleviating poverty in the target populations. Through the \nproject performance monitoring system, the socioeconomic impact of the Project will be assessed and monitored \naccording to selected socioeconomic indicators, which include (i) economic activity and income levels in the project \narea; (ii) industrial and agricultural outputs; (iii) transport costs and time; (iv) transport services and charges, (v) \naccident rates, (vi) degrees of access to functioning services, including school enrollment and infant mortality; (vii) \naccess to information and services regarding sexually transmitted infections (STIs), including HIV/AIDS; and (viii) jobs \ncreated in road construction and maintenance. Employment impact indicators will include information about unskilled, \npoor, and female laborers. \n \nRehabilitating and upgrading prioritized road sections under the supplementary loans is in line with the Medium Term \nDevelopment Strategy (MTDS)a, which highlights the importance of export-driven economic growth, rural development, \nand poverty reduction, including the promotion of agriculture, forestry, fisheries, and tourism. Under the MTDS, one of \nthe mutually supporting expenditure priorities is rehabilitating and maintaining transport infrastructure. This is in line \nwith the priorities set forth in the draft national poverty reduction strategy, which is structured around five pillars: (i) \nstrengthened governance, (ii) increased development of land and natural resources, (iii) improved and maintained \nphysical  infrastructure,  (iv)  improved  and  expanded  economic  growth  opportunities,  and  (v)  strengthened  and \nexpanded social services. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "42   Appendix 9 \nB.

Extremely wide ethnic and cultural diversity characterizes all five provinces, as is reflected in the very large \nnumber of languages spoken. Mutual hostility between, and often within, language groups is the norm, and this is \nreflected in localized tribal fighting. Despite this high diversity, the traditional way of life of these different groups is very \nsimilar, as reflected in settlement patterns, styles of houses, and reliance on subsistence economies. The Highlands \nsettlement pattern is one of isolated homesteads or small, dispersed hamlets. Villages with concentrations of closely \nspaced houses are uncommon. Almost all of the houses are built from bush materials, i.e., wooden frames with woven \nwalls and thick thatched-grass roofs. Most of the affected people will be subsistence agriculturalists who obtain a small \nincome by selling cash crops such as coffee, vegetables, and peanuts. The crops grown are a mixture of traditional and \nintroduced plants. In most areas, the main crop is sweet potato (kaukau), and commonly more than half of the crop is \nfed to pigs, which are kept as prestige items for ceremonial exchange. Most communities suffer no shortage of garden \nfoods for subsistence consumption. A few people along the roads earn irregular cash income from road maintenance \nworks, but the availability of cash work has declined in recent years as funds allocated to road maintenance have \ndeclined. Workforce, vocational, and business skills are generally weak, especially outside the major towns. The levels \nof literacy and health are very poor. Illiteracy rates in the Highlands are about 67% (compared with a national average \nof 55%), with the women\u2019s illiteracy rate of 75% higher than the male illiteracy rate of 60%. Physical infrastructure in the \nHighlands is inadequate to support economic and social development. The provision of Government education, health, \nand policing services is very poor, especially in rural areas. Commercial support services such as legal services, \naccounting, and marketing are limited outside the main cities. Law and order problems, including tribal fighting and \ncrimes such as robbery, murder, assault, and destruction of property, have long been a feature of most parts of modern \nPNG and afflict road users as well as the wider population. The law and order situation in the provinces traversed by \nthe Highlands Highway is grim and reported to be deteriorating. \n \nC.  Participation Process \n \nIs there a stakeholder analysis?    Yes                  No  \n \nExtensive consultations with central and provincial governments and local stakeholders on the selection of road \nsections were conducted during the loan reconnaissance mission in November 2005. The original list proposed by the \ncentral Government included two roads for each province. While there was a consensus over most of the roads, Enga \nand Chimbu provinces expressed different views. The reconnaissance Mission assessed their requests on the grounds \nof economic and social development, linkage to the ongoing project, project cost, and project readiness, and conducted \nfurther  consultations  with  the  central  Government.  An  agreement  was  obtained  on  the  prioritized  list  of  road \nsubprojects. Iterative consultations by the Highlands Region Maintenance Group (HRMG) community relations officer, \nand by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) team during the loan Fact-Finding Mission in February 2006, further \nconfirmed ownership and commitment to the prioritized list from a broad range of stakeholders, including landowners, \ncommunity  leaders,  vehicle  operators,  freight  shippers,  road  constructors,  private  sector  entrepreneurs  and \nshopkeepers, and community-based nongovernment and faith-based organizations. Stakeholder analysis identified \ncritical social and gender issues, and mitigation of anticipated impacts are reflected in the design of the supplementary \nloans. \n \nIs there a participation strategy?     Yes                   No  \n \nCommunities\u2019 participation and their involvement in road rehabilitation and upgrading is a distinctive feature of the \nongoing Project, which will be consistently carried through in the proposed supplementary loans. HRMG\u2019s community \nrelations officer has been indispensable in (i) ensuring that local villagers and landowners are fully appraised of any \nwork that may affect them; (ii) seeking villagers\u2019 and landowners\u2019 active support for the roadwork by explaining to them \nand their communities the potential benefits and inherent risks associated with road construction; (iii) mitigating and/or \navoiding claims and disputes; (iv) helping to resolve disputes; and (v) ensuring women\u2019s adequate participation in \nproject activities and their employment in labor-intensive road maintenance. The proposed supplementary loans will \nbuild on communities\u2019 existing involvement in roadwork and ensure more systematic documentation and incorporation \nof community-related initiatives\u2500with emphasis on women\u2019s participation and involvement in road-related activities\u2500in \nproject progress reports and the project performance monitoring system. The community initiative component to be \nfunded by the supplementary loans will promote (i) continuous support to community involvement in road maintenance \nand (ii) community-based, gender-responsive training on road maintenance, road safety (under the aegis of the \nProvincial Works Administration) and STI/HIV/AIDS prevention (under the aegis of the Provincial Works Administration, \nin consultation with Provincial AIDS Council and Health Administration). \n ", "  Appendix 9  43\nD.  Gender and Development \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \nIn the Highlands\u2019 project area, women are currently involved in a broad range of activities related to road construction \nand maintenance and commercial roadsite services. The supplementary loans will build on critical lessons learned from \nLoan 1709-PNG and proactively support women\u2019s and women groups\u2019 manifested interest in the employment and \nbusiness opportunities associated with project road construction and maintenance. The two-pronged approach to \nmaximize impacts on women will involve the following: \n(i)  Adoption of employment targets to support women\u2019s involvement in road rehabilitation, upgrading, and \nmaintenance. In this respect, DOW, through HRMG, will encourage public works contractors to increase \nthe percentage of women workers to 50% of wage laborers. \n(ii)  Community-based, gender-responsive STI/HIV/AIDS prevention. In PNG, the HIV/AIDS Management and \nPrevention Act (2003) supports a multisector and gender-responsive approach to HIV/AIDS prevention. \nThe International Federation of Consulting Engineers\u2018 HIV and AIDS prevention provisions have been \nadopted by DOW for inclusion in the contract documents for road construction and maintenance projects. \nRisk mitigation measures to be adopted under the Project will include (a) specific assurances to ensure \nSTI/HIV/AIDS  prevention  by  road  contractors  in  the  campsites  and  (b)  community-based,  gender-\nresponsive STI/HIV/AIDS training along the prioritized road sections, to be organized by the HRMG \ncommunity relations officer, in collaboration with the Provincial AIDS Council and Health Administration, \nunder the Community Initiative Component.b  \nHas an output been prepared?

Introduction \n \n1.  The  summary  initial  environmental  examination  (SIEE)  outlines  the  findings  and \nrecommendations  of  the  environmental  assessment  of  11  road  sections  proposed  for \nsupplementary financing in Loan 1709-PNG.1 The environmental assessment process follows \nand complies with the Papua New Guinea (PNG) environmental regulatory framework and the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  Environment  Policy  and  guidelines.  Under  the  PNG \nenvironmental  assessment  regulatory  framework  (i.e.,  the  Environment  Act  2000, \ncomplemented with the Prescribed Activities Regulation [Statutory Instrument No. 30 of 2002]), \nupgrading and rehabilitating existing provincial road sections are categorized as level 1 and do \nnot require formal approval (i.e., an environmental permit) from the Department of Environment \nand Conservation (DEC).2 Under the ADB guidelines, the supplementary loans have been \ncategorized as environmental category B. Initial environmental examination (IEE) reports have \nbeen prepared for the 11 proposed road sections in accordance with the ADB Environmental \nAssessment Guidelines (2003) and comply with the ADB Environment Policy.  \n \nB.  Description of the Project \n \n2.  Supplementary loans will finance the upgrading and rehabilitation of 11 additional road \nsections with a total length of 270 km in the five Highlands provinces. The total cost is estimated \nat $76.27 million. The design for rehabilitating and upgrading will follow the Department of \nWorks  (DOW)  Road  Design  Manual.  The  proposed  horizontal  and  vertical  alignments  will \nclosely  follow  existing  alignments,  requiring  minimal  earthworks.  However,  the  pavement \nreservation defined in the Road Design Manual was modified in specific locations to reduce \nadverse  environmental  impacts  and  construction  costs.  Construction  works  will  entail \n(i) removing vegetation immediately adjacent to the road (within the right of way), (ii) excavating \nand  disposing  of  unsuitable  material  from  road  shoulders  and  cuttings,  (iii)  placing  and \ncompacting granular base, and (iv) sealing selected road sections. Existing pipe culverts will be \nrehabilitated and retained, and new headwalls and aprons provided as necessary. Additional \ntransverse culverts are required to improve drainage of the road area. Additionally, longitudinal \nculverts and/or shallow drains will be provided to facilitate access to adjoining homesteads and \ncommercial developments. Most of the 52 bailey and steel girder bridges will require only minor \nrepairs. \n \nC.  Description of the Environment \n \n1.  Physical Resources \n \n3.  The proposed road sections are located in the mountainous region of PNG known as the \nHighlands. Numerous, sometimes large, valleys at 1,100\u20131,800 meters above sea level (masl) \nare divided by often steep and rugged ranges of hills and mountains, which reach altitudes in \nmany place of more than 3,000 masl. Small earthquakes and heavy rainfall are responsible for \nmany deteriorated sections of all national and rural roads, particularly in Eastern Highlands and \nChimbu provinces. There is a marked increase in the annual rainfall from the eastern and \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 1999.

", "  Appendix 10  45\nsouthern parts (1,280 and 2,880 millimeters/year, respectively) toward the central parts of the \nHighlands (more than 3,000 millimeters/year).  \n \n2.  Ecological Resources \n \n4.  In the Highlands, almost all of the area below the effective upper limit of cultivation, at \nabout  2,400  masl,  is  covered  with  a  mosaic  of  gardens,  tree  crops  (especially  coffee), \ngrasslands and shrub lands, groves of useful timber trees, and patches of regrowth forest. Many \nhills and ridge tops had little gardening in the past, and dense regrowth forests of mid-montane \ntrees remain. Where forests survive, they are used for hunting, mainly using traditional methods. \nNone of the proposed road sections traverses an environmentally sensitive area. No forestry \nconcessions exist in any areas accessible from the roads currently under consideration for \nrehabilitation and upgrading. \n \n3.  Human and Economic Development \n \n5.  In 2000, the five provinces comprising the Highlands had a total population of almost 2 \nmillion people, about 40% of the total PNG population. The population of the districts where the \nroad sections are located was approximately 884,000. Most of the beneficiaries in the target \narea are subsistence agriculturalists who obtain a small income by selling cash crops such as \ncoffee, vegetables, and peanuts. Local residents sell their produce to other locals and the \ntraveling public. Most of the markets are established within the right of way, but generally there \nare no fixed structures close to the road.  \n \n4.  Quality of Life Values and the Sociocultural Environment \n \n6.  Extremely  wide  ethnic  and  cultural  diversity  characterizes  the  Highlands,  which  is \nreflected in the several hundreds of languages spoken there. Mutual hostility between language \ngroups  is  the  norm,  bringing  localized  tribal  fighting.  About  97%  of  the  land  remains  in \ncustomary collective ownership, though this does not give any clear guarantee of tenure. Land \nis not regarded as a commodity that can be bought and sold by individuals, but as a permanent \nand integral part of a village community. The complex land tenure arrangement is also a \nconstraint on the state's ability to impose statutory law over customary law. \n \nD.  Forecasting Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n \n1.  Environmental Benefits \n \n7.  Local communities may benefit from the improved road conditions through (i) reduced \ndust nuisance, (ii) improved drainage along the road, (iii) improved land stability at filled-up \nlocations, and (iv) improved mobility and health. Proceeds from increased employment and \neconomic opportunities may subsequently be invested in improving communities\u2019 living and \nenvironmental conditions.  \n \n2.  Design and/or Preconstruction Phase Considerations \n \n8.  During  the  design  and  preconstruction  phase,  ample  attention  has  been  given  to \nintegrating concerns related to (i) potential adverse impacts on protected or environmental \nsensitive areas (mitigated by ensuring that none of the proposed road sections will traverse or \nimpact such areas); (ii) the application of appropriate technical solutions to address higher \n ", "46  Appendix 10 \noccurrence  of  landslides  and  subsequent  erosion  risks,  especially  in  Chimbu  and  Eastern \nHighlands provinces; (iii) safety issues by limiting the expected speed increase on the road \nsections; (iv) cultural sites (by describing procedures to be followed for ceremonial and burial \nsites along the road section); and (v) other social and community concerns, as also experienced \nwhile implementing Loan 1709-PNG.  \n \n3.  Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures during the Construction \nPhase \n \n9.  Construction works will result in limited temporary adverse environmental impacts, but \nthey can be minimized by ensuring proper construction practices and adequate compliance \nmonitoring.  Some  of  the  key  environmental  impacts  that  have  been  identified  and  their \nmitigation measures are as follows: \n(i)  Clearing vegetation and excavation works may result in erosion and loss of \nsediments, which will be mitigated by minimizing soil and vegetation clearance.  \n(ii)  Changes in drainage patterns may cause obstruction of storm water flow and \nincreased flooding and siltation, which will be mitigated by controlling storm water \nand drainage. \n(iii)  Noise and dust will increase along the roadsides during roadwork, which will be \nmitigated by spraying exposed surfaces during dry periods, proper maintenance \nof equipment, and careful selection and management of quarries. \n(iv)  Health and safety risks will be mitigated by ensuring all occupational health and \nsafety requirements in place on construction sites and work camps. \n(v)  Pollution from waste disposal will be mitigated by adequate offsite and waste \nmanagement, satisfying safety and health concerns. \n(vi)  The residual impact from decommissioning construction sites will be mitigated by \nsatisfactory decommissioning procedures.  \nA more complete list of environmental impact and mitigation measures is presented in the \nenvironmental management and monitoring plans (EMMP). \n \n4.  Environmental  Impacts  and  Mitigation  Measures  during  the  Operational \nPhase \n \n10.  Environmental impacts during the operational phase will be mainly noise, dust, and \nvehicle  emissions  affecting  air  quality,  as  well  as  traffic  accidents.  The  noise  impact  is \nconsidered low because (i) the volume of traffic is quite low, (ii) there are few heavy vehicles on \nthe road, (iii) vehicles will move slowly because of speed restrictions; and (iv) noise from \nindividual vehicles will be lower on sealed sections than on the existing gravel. Air quality \nimpacts from vehicle emissions will be low also because of low traffic volumes and is not likely \nto have significant health impacts. An increased risk of traffic accidents will be mitigated through \n(i)  speed  reduction  measures  (e.g.,  installing  speed  bumps  at  settlements,  schools,  and \nmarkets), (ii) off-road boarding areas for PMVs, (iii) improved road signage and pavement \nmarkings, and (iv) consultations and awareness campaigns with local communities. \n \n5.  Cumulative Impacts \n \n11.  No significant cumulative impacts from the supplementary loans have been identified. \nThe most likely cumulative impacts are general, related to increased economic activity in the \nHighlands. However, none of these is considered significant. \n \n ", "  Appendix 10  47\n6.  Environmental Management Plan \n \n12.  The findings and proposed mitigation measures for each subproject have been compiled \ninto an EMMP included in the IEE reports. Where appropriate, implementation details will need \nto be elaborated and updated and will be subject to review as part of the bidding evaluation \nprocedures. Mitigation measures and a monitoring plan have been prepared and discussed with \nDEC (a summary is included in Table A.10). The total cost of implementing the monitoring plan \nduring the construction phase is estimated at K75,000 per year.3 Monitoring costs during the \noperations phase is estimated at K1,000/year/road section. A monitoring checklist, based on  \nEMMP, will be used in the field for monitoring and reporting. \n \nE.  Institutional Requirements and Environmental Monitoring Plan \n \n13.  As the Executing Agency for the supplementary loans, DOW will be responsible for \nimplementation  and  compliance  with  EMMP.  Day-to-day  implementation  and  compliance \nmonitoring will be the task of the environment officer of the HRMG, under the supervision of the \nfield project manager and supported by the provincial field supervision engineers. The findings \nof regular monitoring activities, as specified in the monitoring plan, will be included in the \nquarterly progress reports to be submitted to ADB. These will include (i) an overview of the \nstatus of EMMP preparation and (ii) compliance with completed EMMP. The progress reports \nwill  be  submitted  for  information  to  DEC  and  ADB,  with  copies  provided  to  the  DOW \nenvironment coordinator in Port Moresby. Compliance with EMMP will be subject to assessment \nby review missions from ADB and/or DEC and included in the project completion report. \n \n14.  HRMG staff members have gained the necessary experience in compliance monitoring \nduring the implementation of Loan 1709-PNG. Combined with improved project procedures and \nthe  additional  capacity  building  and  quality  control  to  be  provided  by  the  implementation \nconsultants,  the  capacity  of  HRMG  to  carry  out  compliance  monitoring  and  reporting  is \nconsidered adequate. Because anticipated environmental impacts are limited and monitoring \ntechniques are straightforward, no further specific training activities are required. \n \nF.  Public Consultation and Disclosure \n \n15.  During January and February 2006, consultations were held with local communities in \nthe affected districts and government officials in provincial capitals in the Highlands and Port \nMoresby. The findings of the consultations along nine proposed road sections4 confirm strong \noverall support and willingness to cooperate with HRMG and contractors in implementing the \nsubprojects. Support from provincial governments has been demonstrated through their active \ninvolvement  in  discussing  and  resolving  implementation  arrangements  with  the  local \ncommunities during the current subprojects of Loan 1709-PNG. Since 2000, the provincial \ngovernments  of  Chimbu,  Western  Highlands,  Eastern  Highlands,  and  Enga  have  signed \nagreements with community representatives on implementation arrangements for the various \nHRMG subprojects.  \n \n16.  Documented support for the individual subprojects and pledged cooperation with HRMG \nare included in the separate IEE reports. Beneficiary consultations will be continued throughout \nthe  preparation  and  construction  phases.  Records  of  environmental  and  social  complaints \n                                                 \n3  Based on K3,000 per road section for preparing the quarry management plan and obtaining the DEC environmental \npermit, and K2,000/year/road section for monitoring.  \n4  Consultations for the Southern Highlands were started in 1999 as part of the preparation for Loan 1709-PNG. \n ", "48  Appendix 10 \nreceived during consultations, field visits, and/or informal discussions, or by formal letter\u2014\ntogether with the subsequent follow-up\u2014will be kept in a simple database in the HRMG project \noffice. \n \nG.  Findings and Recommendations \n \n17.  Discussions with HRMG staff, a review of documents, and field assessments of most of \nthe proposed road sections lead to the conclusion that significant and/or irreversible impacts are \nunlikely  and  that  the  subprojects  comply  with  ADB's  environmental  safeguard  policies.  In \nparticular, the proposed subprojects are not located in environmentally sensitive or conservation \nareas, will not increase logging or hunting, and are strongly supported and requested by the \nlocal communities. No significant associated or cumulative impacts are identified. Therefore, a \nmore  detailed  environmental  impact  assessment  is  not  warranted,  and  the  IEEs  will  be \ncompleted as the final environment assessment documents of the Project.  \n \nH.  Conclusions \n \n18.  The  initial environmental  screening  process  and  analysis  of  potential  environmental \nimpacts lead to the conclusion that the proposed subprojects are unlikely to result in any direct, \nsignificant  adverse  environmental  impact.  The  scope  of  rehabilitating  and  upgrading  the \nproposed road sections, and their anticipated environmental impacts, are of a magnitude that \ndoes not require further study. As listed in the environmental management plan, all potential \nenvironmental concerns can be properly mitigated. Consequently, the environmental monitoring \nplan (Table A.10) provides sufficient guidance for HRMG to successfully monitor and report on \nenvironmental compliance during subproject implementation.
