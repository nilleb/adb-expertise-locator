THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed loan \nand (ii) a proposed grant, both to the Kyrgyz Republic for the Climate Change and Disaster-\nResilient Water Resources Sector Project. \n \n2.  The project will strengthen the climate change and disaster resilience of the water sector \nthrough modernized and well-maintained infrastructure, enhanced agricultural and on-farm water \nmanagement, and improved disaster risk management (DRM).1 The project interventions will be \nboth structural (including civil works and equipment) and nonstructural (including capacity building \nand demonstration activities). The interventions will focus on the Ferghana Valley in the southwest \nof the country and the Chui River Basin in the north, which are vulnerable to flooding, landslides \n(including mudflows), and drought risks that are likely to be exacerbated by climate change. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Context  of  vulnerability.  With  steep  mountain  geography  and  variable  weather \nconditions, the Kyrgyz Republic is highly disaster-prone. Disasters triggered by climatic and \ngeophysical natural hazards are frequent and estimated to cost the country equivalent to 1.0%\u2013\n1.5% of gross domestic product annually.2 Much of the population is vulnerable and exposed, \nwith limited resources to mitigate and recover from disaster impacts. A primary avenue of this \nvulnerability is through the water resources sector, including irrigated agriculture. Irrigation is \ncritical for sustained agricultural production in the Kyrgyz Republic, which engages about 30% of \nthe population (including about 45% of the lower-income rural population) and contributes about \n15% of gross domestic product.3 \n \n4.  Notable water-related disaster events include severe droughts (2009 and 2014) in the \nnorthern  districts,  and  landslides  (2003  and  2004)  and  flooding  (2007  and  2012)  in  the \nsouthwestern districts.4 Future climatic change is likely to increase the frequency and magnitude \nof such events. Drought and associated water stress may occur more often as temperatures rise. \nPrecipitation and snowmelt patterns are expected to change adversely, with water availability \ndeclining in the face of growing competing demands.5 Landslides and floods are likely to become \nmore frequent as a result of melting permafrost and more intense precipitation events.6 \n \n5.  Sector institutional context. The Ministry of Emergency Situations (MOES) and the \nDepartment of Water Resources and Melioration (DWR) under the Ministry of Agriculture, Food \nIndustry, and Melioration are the primary agencies for DRM in the water resources sector. The \nMOES is the national institution for cross-sector civil protection, including disaster prevention and \nrehabilitation, along the main water courses. The Agency for Hydrometeorology under the MOES, \n                                                \n1  The project was prepared under Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2017.

Manila (TA 8119-REG). \n \n ", "2 \nor KyrgyzHydromet, is the national institution for hydrometeorological monitoring and analysis, \nincluding forecasting and warning of extreme weather-related events. The DWR constructs and \nmaintains the main canals of the irrigation systems, including associated flood management \ninfrastructure. Irrigation infrastructure management is coordinated with the local water users \nassociations (WUAs), which construct and maintain the lower-level (on-farm and inter-farm) \ncanals. \n \n6.  Water resources management and DRM are afforded high government priority. However, \nfollowing the collapse of the Soviet Union, Kyrgyz water resources infrastructure has become \ndilapidated and inefficient, offering insufficient protection and resilience to natural hazards.7 \nIrrigation infrastructure design and management is often suboptimal, with inadequate investment \nand maintenance by the DWR and WUAs. As a result, systems often do not have enough water \nfor  the  cropped  area  and  have  sustainable  but  low-productivity  operations  with  significant \nopportunity for improvement. The capacity of WUAs is highly variable, and WUAs often have \ninsufficient and inequitable stakeholder representation, particularly of women, in decision-making \nprocesses.  Female  farmers  contribute  significantly  to  cultivating  activities  but  are  at  a \ndisadvantage when accessing financial markets and agricultural value chains because of social \nand knowledge barriers. Community consultation has identified strong demand and need for \ninvestments in lower-level canal infrastructure, and improved integration with modernized primary \nand secondary canals. The MOES has insufficient equipment to fully undertake its planned annual \ndisaster prevention and rehabilitation (including recovery) works, and lack of recent investment \nmeans  the  equipment  is  used  beyond  its  economic  lifetime,  thereby  reducing  efficiency. \nKyrgyzHydromet  is  hampered  by  a  sparse  monitoring  network  and  insufficient  forecasting \ncapacity. This overall situation is likely to be aggravated by growing and competing water demand \nfrom population and economic growth and increased demands from agriculture, households, \nindustry, and the energy sector. \n \n7.  Government sector strategy. The project is a priority climate adaptation project in the \nKyrgyz Climate Investment Programme.8 Strengthening resilience to climate change and extreme \nweather events in water resources management is underpinned by the country\u2019s Water Code \n(2005) and the government\u2019s national development, climate change, and sector strategies. The \nWater Code is the primary water-related legal act and is based on the principles of integrated \nwater resources management, organization of water resources management by river basin, and \nuser participation in decision making. The national development program for 2018\u20132022 includes \nproactive management of disaster and climate change risks, and prioritizes the construction and \nrehabilitation of irrigation infrastructure with improved water efficiency.9 The Strategy for the \nComprehensive Protection of the Population and the Territory of the Kyrgyz Republic from \nEmergency Situations for 2018\u20132030 seeks to reduce disaster losses through, among other \nmeasures, improved monitoring, forecasting, and construction of protective structures that require \nabout Som9.8 billion in funding for 2018\u20132022.10 The State Programme on the Development of \nIrrigation of the Kyrgyz Republic for 2017\u20132026 seeks more productive use of water resources \nthrough the construction and modernization of infrastructure and the introduction of improved \ntechnologies, which require about Som59 billion in funding.11 \n                                                \n7  ADB. 2016.

Opportunities and lessons learned. The project was initially identified and elaborated \nunder an Asian Development Bank (ADB) regional technical assistance through stakeholder \nconsultations on investment needs for climate change and disaster resilience in the Kyrgyz \nRepublic (footnote 6). To mitigate future climate change and disaster impacts on the livelihoods \nof vulnerable communities, these consultations identified that (i) water access and availability \nshould be made more resilient to future disruptions, variability, and change; (ii) resilience to \nextreme weather events should be improved; and (iii) institutional capacity for climate and disaster \nrisk management and response should be strengthened. An earlier ADB regional technical \nassistance undertook a detailed assessment of the agricultural and water resources sector in the \ncountry and identified priority investment needs for irrigation infrastructure.12 The ADB Agricultural \nArea  Development  Project,  completed  in  2009  and  rated  successful,  improved  agricultural \nmanagement,  rehabilitated  irrigation  infrastructure,  and  supported  business  development.13 \nLessons from ADB activities in the country and region call for (i) incorporating climate change and \ndisaster risk assessment into infrastructure design; (ii) optimizing water resources use through a \nmore inclusive and gender-sensitive participatory planning and management process; and (iii) \nsupporting infrastructure investment with improved capacity for water resources monitoring, \nforecasting, and warning of extreme events. \n \n9.  Development  partners  support  climate  resilience  and  DRM  in  the  Kyrgyz  Republic, \nincluding the water resources sector, through investment projects and technical assistance.14 \nDuring project preparation, ADB worked closely with development partners, including through the \nKyrgyz Republic Pilot Program for Climate Resilience financed by the Climate Investment Funds, \nto ensure appropriate coordination on project activities, avoid overlap of investments and target \nareas, and incorporate lessons from earlier and ongoing projects. The World Bank supports \n(i) capacity building and equipment modernization of KyrgyzHydromet for improved weather data \ncollection  and  forecasting  under  the  Central  Asian  Hydromet  Modernization  Project, \n(ii) strengthening of WUAs and water resources data management under the National Water \nResources  Management  Project  (Phase  1),  and  (iii)  on-farm  irrigation  infrastructure  and \nmanagement  under  the  Agriculture  Productivity  and  Nutrition  Improvement  Project.  United \nNations agencies and the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe support climate \nresilience and transboundary water resources management in the Chu-Talas Basin through \nseveral projects. The United Nations Development Programme is preparing in parallel a mudflow \nprotection and forecasting project. However, the country has large investment needs, particularly \nfor irrigation infrastructure and equipment for sustainable and effective DRM capacity. \n \n10.  Value added by ADB assistance. The project draws from the ADB Irrigation Subsector \nGuidance Note (2017) to emphasize irrigation modernization over simple rehabilitation and \ntargets optimized and resilient agricultural production as well as improved water productivity.15 To \nensure more productive and sustainable long-term outcomes, the project will take an inclusive \nparticipatory approach to irrigation subproject implementation with government and community \nstakeholders jointly engaged in the planning, design, construction, and subsequent system \nmanagement. The project will incorporate elements of high-level technologies by pilot testing a \nnew hydrological monitoring and forecasting system for the Kyrgyz Republic using satellite data. \nThe sector lending modality is appropriate for this project to support the government\u2019s sector \ndevelopment plans;16 the government has adequate capacity to implement the plans, but the \n                                                \n12 ADB. 2013.

The project will (i) design and build climate change and disaster-resilient irrigation \ninfrastructure;  (ii)  strengthen  irrigation  management  arrangements,  including  operation  and \nmaintenance (O&M), between the WUAs and the local DWR offices; (iii) enhance and strengthen \nWUAs and WUA subgroups; and (iv) build executing agencies\u2019 capacity on procurement, financial \nmanagement, and environmental and social safeguards. The project establishes a template for \nclimate change and disaster-resilient investment that may be scaled up and replicated. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n11.  The project is aligned with the following impact: losses in the agriculture and water \nresources sectors from extreme weather events reduced.17 The project will have the following \noutcome: climate change and disaster resilience of infrastructure and water security improved.18 \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n12.  Output 1: Irrigation infrastructure protected and modernized. The project will protect \nand modernize irrigation systems to improve the productivity and disaster resilience of about \n20,000 hectares of irrigated land. It will upgrade and construct main (primary and secondary) \ncanals;  lower-level  (inter-farm  and  on-farm)  canals;  and  associated  infrastructure  such  as \nprotective mudflow crossing structures, cross-regulators, and offtakes.19 Infrastructure design \nspecifications will incorporate disaster risk mitigation measures for future climate conditions. The \nproject will mobilize a participatory planning and design process involving the DWR, WUAs, WUA \nsubgroups, and other key stakeholders to ensure equitable and sustainable outcomes. One \nrepresentative subproject has been selected and developed during project preparation and two \nor  three  additional  subprojects  will  be  identified  for  investment  during  implementation.20 \nCommunity-based contracting will be pilot tested for lower-level canal modernization in the \nrepresentative subproject and will be expanded to further subprojects if shown to be successful. \n \n13.  Output 2: Irrigation system and agricultural land management enhanced. The project \nwill strengthen management and O&M of target irrigation systems, including practical drought and \nclimate risk management, to ensure the sustainability of the investment benefits. In conjunction \nwith  output  1,  under  the  participatory  planning  process,  the  project  will  (i)  reorganize  and \nstrengthen the institutional capacity of WUAs and WUA subgroups for more effective organization; \nand (ii) build the capacity of the DWR representatives, WUA and WUA subgroup representatives, \nand farmers on effective and resilient irrigation system management, water use, and agronomy. \nThe project will develop and implement joint DWR\u2013WUA irrigation system management plans, \nincluding  water  delivery  scheduling  and O&M  financing  and  planning. WUA  on-farm  water \nmanagement  and  agricultural  management  plans  with  gender  elements  will  be  developed, \nincluding irrigation scheduling, cropping patterns, and cultural methods, and will be supported \nwith  capacity  building  for  farmers  and  community  members  (including  women),  such  as \ncomparative field trials and farmer field days. \n \n                                                \n17 Government of the Kyrgyz Republic. 2015.

Output 3: National disaster risk management capacity improved. The project will \nsupport capacity building and upgrade equipment for national DRM in the water resources sector. \nHeavy machinery and specialist equipment for preventive and rehabilitation works, such as \nexcavators, bulldozers, and cranes, will be purchased and installed in the Northern and Southern \nEmergency Response Centers of the MOES. This will be accompanied by enhancement of the \nCenters\u2019  asset  management  and  capacity  building  on  DRM,  including  project  planning,  to \nundertake preventive and rehabilitation works more efficiently in the water resources sector. \nHydrological posts for KyrgyzHydromet will be installed in about 20 sites in the project\u2019s target \nareas and an information system for enhanced data collection, processing, and flood warning will \nbe pilot tested for improved efficiency and accuracy. \n \nD.

DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical \n \n20.  The project has been assessed as technically feasible and designed to ensure the long-\nterm resilience and sustainability of the investments. A feasibility study has been undertaken for \na  representative  subproject  that  considered  future  water  availability  and  flood  risks,  which \nprovides  the  basis  for  the  additional  subprojects.  The  participatory  planning,  design,  and \nmanagement process under outputs 1 and 2 will facilitate a more engaged decision-making \nprocess among stakeholders for optimal use of water resources. Sustainable management plans \nfor infrastructure and equipment will be developed under outputs 2 and 3 to ensure best practice \nasset management and O&M of project investments. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n \n21.  The project is expected to be economically viable and sustainable. The representative \nsubproject is estimated to have an economic internal rate of return of 16%. The monetized benefit \nis improved farmer income from optimal agricultural production that is more resilient to climate \nchange and disaster risk. The nonquantifiable benefits include protection of the wider population \nfrom avoided impacts of flood damage through the improved and expanded preventive works and \nenhanced flood forecasting. The risks to the sustainability of the investments, particularly irrigation \nschemes, are mitigated through the development and implementation under outputs 2 and 3 of \nsustainable O&M plans, including institutional arrangements, financing, and cost sharing. To be \n ", "8 \neligible to participate in the project and benefit from investments, WUAs and WUA subgroups \nmust demonstrate financial sustainability and undergo financial management training. ADB has \nsecured government assurance that adequate finance will be provided to meet its share of O&M \ncosts to implement these plans. Within the framework of the project, ADB will engage in broader \npolicy dialogue with the government and other development partners on ensuring adequate \nfinancing of irrigation and DRM assets. \n \nC.  Governance \n \n22.  The  pre-mitigation  financial  management  risk  is  substantial  because  the  executing \nagencies (i) have limited experience in ADB policies and requirements for project financial \nmanagement and (ii) generally do not apply international standards for accounting and internal \nand external audit. The risks will be mitigated through the (i) establishment of a PIU with a qualified \nchief accountant and a financial specialist; (ii) establishment of a PIU financial management \nsystem, including the use of commercial accounting software by the PIU; (iii) provision of on-the-\njob support and training to the PIU by a project implementation consultant; and (iv) annual \nmanagement audits of the PIU by an external firm on procurement processes, payment processes \nand systems (including bank reconciliation), and fixed-asset management. \n \n23.  The pre-mitigation procurement risk is substantial because the executing agencies have \n(i) limited experience in ADB procurement policies and requirements and (ii) insufficient internal \nsystems  in  place for governance  on  procurement.  The  risks  will  be  mitigated through  the \n(i) establishment  of  a  PIU  with  qualified  procurement  specialists,  (ii)  establishment  of  a \nprocurement management system in the PIU, (iii) provision of on-the-job support and training to \nthe PIU by a project implementation consultant, (iv) annual PIU management audits, and (v) use \nof prior review procedures. \n \n24.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government,  the  DWR,  and  the  MOES.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and \nsupplementary measures are described in the PAM (footnote 21). \n \nD.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n25.  The vulnerability of the lower-income population engaged in agriculture is a result of \nseveral factors, including small farm lots, limited access to finance, inefficient practices and \ntechnologies, and dilapidated infrastructure. The project is expected to help alleviate these \nchallenges by providing climate-resilient irrigation infrastructure, improving institutional DRM, and \nimproving agricultural and water management. These will mitigate the negative effects of extreme \nweather events on properties and livelihoods. \n \n26.  The project is classified effective gender mainstreaming as it addresses the gender issues \nrelevant to the project, such as (i) women\u2019s participation in WUAs and WUA subgroups, (ii) \ngender-sensitive plans for improved irrigation and agricultural management, and (iii) women\u2019s \nparticipation in training.27 \n \nE.  Safeguards \n \n27.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project\u2019s safeguard \ncategories are as follows.28 \n                                                \n27 Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n28 ADB. Safeguard Categories. https://www.adb.org/site/safeguards/safeguard-categories. \n ", "9 \n \n28.  Environment (category B). A draft initial environmental examination (IEE), including an \nenvironmental management plan (EMP), has been prepared by the executing agencies for the \nrepresentative subproject and disclosed on ADB\u2019s website. Additional subprojects will be selected \nduring project implementation and an environmental assessment and review framework has been \nprepared and disclosed on ADB\u2019s website. The executing agencies will rule out civil works and \nsubprojects with significant environmental impacts (only category B and C will be eligible), and an \nIEE will be performed for each subproject. An EMP will provide appropriate mitigation and \nmonitoring  measures  and  a  capacity  building plan for  each  subproject;  contractors  will  be \nresponsible for implementing the mitigation measures. Project impacts during construction are \nexpected to be site-specific and temporary and related to the construction of the subproject \ncomponents. Potential impacts during the operation phase are related to limited local capacity to \nmaintain  the  functionality  of  the  components,  with  expected  positive  impacts  from  the \nrehabilitation works. \n \n29.  Involuntary resettlement (category B). A draft land acquisition and resettlement plan \n(LARP) has been prepared by the executing agencies for the representative subproject and \ndisclosed on ADB\u2019s website. Additional subprojects will be selected during project implementation \nand a land acquisition and resettlement framework has been prepared and disclosed on ADB\u2019s \nwebsite. The executing agencies will rule out category A civil works and subprojects, avoid land \nacquisition, and minimize resettlement impacts. Appropriate social safeguard documents will be \nprepared,  approved,  and  fully  implemented  before  any  works  commence.29  Surveys  and \nconsultation carried out during preparation for the representative subproject identified two affected \nhouseholds with 12 household members.30 No land acquisition is required, and resettlement \ncompensation for the affected assets was calculated and budgeted as part of the draft LARP \npreparation. No household will experience severe impacts or belongs to vulnerable groups. \n \n30.  The PIU will recruit a full-time safeguards specialist who will receive on-the-job training \nand support from the project implementation consultant on monitoring the EMP and LARP \nimplementation during construction. A grievance redress mechanism will be established by the \nPIU following the LARP, the land acquisition and resettlement framework, the environmental \nassessment and review framework, and the IEE and EMP to assist affected persons in resolving \ngrievances and complaints. The PIU will submit semiannual safeguard reports to ADB for review \nand disclosure. \n \n31.  Indigenous peoples (category C). No indigenous peoples are present in the Kyrgyz \nRepublic as defined by ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. \n \nF.  Summary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n \n32.
