I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nloan and (ii) proposed administration of a grant to be provided by the Global Environment \nFacility  (GEF),  both  to  the  Republic  of  Indonesia  for  the  Coral  Reef  Rehabilitation  and \nManagement Program\u2014Coral Triangle Initiative Project (COREMAP\u2014CTI).1 \n \n2.  The project will enable coastal communities, and the institutions that support them, to \nmanage coral reef resources, associated ecosystems, and biodiversity in a sustainable manner \nfor increasing the economic and social welfare of coastal communities. The COREMAP\u2014CTI \nwill support the government\u2019s sector development plan and national targets for establishing \neffective marine protected areas (MPAs).2 Project implementation will focus on improving the \nmanagement, sustainability, and resilience of MPAs. The project area comprises seven district \nMPAs located in Bintan, Batam, Lingga, and Natuna districts in Kepulauan Riau province; \nCentral Tapanuli and North Nias districts in North Sumatra province; Mentawai district in West \nSumatra province; and three national MPAs, namely, Anambas in Anambas district, Kepulauan \nRiau province; Pulau Pieh in Pariaman district, West Sumatra province; and Gilimatra in North \nLombok district, West Nusa Tenggara province.3  \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n3.  Indonesia is the world\u2019s largest archipelagic nation, with 18% of the world\u2019s coral reefs \nthat host diverse marine flora and fauna.4 Indonesia\u2019s coastal ecosystems serve as an important \nbase for the country\u2019s economic growth. Sustainable management of the coral reef ecosystem \nis therefore a major objective of Indonesia\u2019s marine and fisheries sector development plan, \nwhich is guided by (i) the National Long-Term Development Plan, 2005\u20132025, (ii) the Medium-\nTerm Development Plan, 2010\u20132014, and (iii) the Ministry of Marine Affairs and Fisheries \n(MMAF) Strategic Plan, 2010\u20132014.5 The government has policies to address sector issues \nrelating to coastal and marine resource management.6 Collectively, these policies and plans \narticulate the government\u2019s priorities for the sector and comprise the sector development plan. \nIndonesia has also played a central role in the Coral Triangle Initiative on Coral Reefs, Fisheries \nand Food Security, a six-country program of regional cooperation to sustainably manage coastal \nand marine resources in the region.7 \n \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  Sector Assessment (Summary): Agriculture, Natural Resources and Environment (Marine and Fishery Subsector) \n(accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n3  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided project preparatory technical assistance.

Jakarta. \n6  Sector and Institutional Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n7  This is a multilateral partnership among the governments of Indonesia, Malaysia, Papua New Guinea, the \nPhilippines, Solomon Islands, and Timor-Leste. At the First Ministerial Meeting in 2009, these governments agreed \nto adopt a 10-year CTI Regional Plan of Action to safeguard the region\u2019s marine and coastal biological resources. \nOne of the CTI goals is to establish a fully functioning and effectively managed region-wide Coral Triangle Marine \nProtected Area System. http://www.coraltriangleinitiative.org/ ", "2 \n4.  Low  awareness  of  coastal  communities  on  coral  reef  conservation,  inadequate \ninstitutional  capacity  to  contain  land-  and  marine-based  pollution,  insufficient  institutional \nframeworks and capacity to effectively manage MPAs, and persistent poverty in coastal areas \nhave resulted in degradation of about 70% of Indonesia\u2019s coral reef ecosystem.8 To address \nthese root causes, the Government of Indonesia has adopted a multifaceted approach focusing \non (i) institutional capacity building, (ii) development of models for establishment and effective \nmanagement  of  MPAs,  and  (iii)  reduction  of  coastal  poverty  through  income-generating \ninfrastructure and sustainable livelihoods. This project represents the last of a three-phase \nprogram in which the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the World Bank are working in close \ncooperation  with  the  government  in  complementary  geographic  areas.9 The  first  phase \n(COREMAP I) established a viable framework for a national coral reef management system in \nIndonesia.10 The second phase (COREMAP II) consolidated the knowledge base, adopted a \ncommunity-based approach for decentralized coral reef management, and built strong public \nawareness on coral reef conservation.11 COREMAP II initiated institutional development for \nmodel MPA systems and tested the feasibility of sustainable livelihood activities for reducing \nfishing pressures in targeted coastal communities. ADB and the World Bank project completion \nreports  for  COREMAP  II  described  several  lessons  that  have  been  incorporated  in  the \nCOREMAP\u2014CTI project design. These include the need for (i) commitment and support from \nlocal government bodies, (ii) integration of value chain analysis of livelihood activities in the \nproject design, and (iii) effective mainstreaming of gender concerns. \n \n5.  The project will contribute to meeting the government\u2019s marine and fisheries sector \ndevelopment plan\u2019s overall targets to establish 20.0 million hectares of effective MPAs by 2020 \n(of  which  15.7  million  hectares  were  established  by  2012)  and  to  effectively  manage  15 \nthreatened, endangered, and endemic species. This consolidation phase will develop model \nMPAs  with  effective  management,  financial  sustainability,  capacity  for  community  co-\nmanagement, and enforcement of regulations. The project will also create models of sustainable \nmicroenterprise  models  for  communities.  The  project  is  aligned  with  Indonesia\u2019s  country \npartnership strategy, 2012\u20132014 with regard to its two strategic pillars of inclusive growth and \nenvironmental sustainability. The project is also aligned with Indonesia\u2019s National Plan of Action \nfor the CTI12 and ADB\u2019s package of technical assistance support to implement this plan.13 \n \n6.  Climate  change-induced  ocean  temperature  increase,  sea  level  rise,  and  ocean \nacidification have adverse impacts on coral reef ecosystems and biodiversity. MPAs, as carbon \nsinks,  mitigate  climate  change  by  protecting  and  enhancing  habitats  such  as  coral  reefs, \nmangroves, and sea grasses. Several project locations have seen climate change-induced \ntemperature rise impacting coral reefs through coral bleaching. The project\u2019s focus on effective \nMPA management, support for integrated coastal zone management, sustainable livelihoods, \nand public awareness activities will enhance resilience of coral reef ecosystems and contribute \nto  adaptive  capacity  of  target  coastal  communities  to  climate  change  impacts.

The impact will be the sustainable management of coral reef ecosystems in the project \narea. The outcome will be the enhanced capacity to manage coral reef ecosystems inside and \noutside target MPAs.  \n \n8.  The  project  will  be  implemented  in  the  seven  district  MPAs  located  in  existing \nCOREMAP II areas and three national MPAs in three new districts (para. 2) that include at least \n57 project villages. These 10 MPAs will serve as models for effective management, for potential \nreplication and/or scaling up across 100 or more demarcated MPAs.  \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n9.  The project will have four outputs.15  \n \n(i)  Coral reef management and institutions strengthened. This will strengthen \ncapacity  developed  under  COREMAP  II  and  institutionalize  community-based \ncoral reef management initiatives within existing government legal systems and \ninstitutions by (a) incorporating roles and responsibilities of lembaga pengelola \nsumberdaya  terumbu  karang  (community  coral  reef  resource  management \ninstitutions) in village administrative structures through regulations; (b) upgrading \ninformation  centers  established  under  COREMAP  II  into  resource  centers; \n(c) providing support and mentoring by MMAF extension workers to district-level \nimplementing agencies\u2019 staff to mainstream a community coral reef management \napproach;  (d)  establishing  learning  networks  of  fishing  communities,  MPA \nmanagers, and local government officials to learn from each other and adopt best \npractices;  (e)  conducting  socioeconomic  and  ecological  surveys  by  the \nIndonesian Institute of Sciences (LIPI); (f) developing a decentralized certification \nprogram by LIPI for ecological benefit monitoring; (g) upgrading the coral reef \nmanagement information system to include web-based user data access and \nreporting; (h) conducting teacher training on local content curriculum; (i) providing \na postgraduate program for Directorate General of Capture Fisheries staff to \ndevelop  sustainable  fisheries  management  expertise;  (j)  strengthening  MPA \nsurveillance by providing equipment, infrastructure, policies, monitoring, control, \nand  joint  patrols  (inter-agency  and  community  surveillance  groups);  and  (k) \nconducting training on conservation, coastal management, ecosystem approach \nto fisheries management (EAFM), ecosystem monitoring, and data management. \n(ii)  Ecosystem-based  resource  management  developed.  This  output  will \nstrengthen  MPA  management  effectiveness  and  biodiversity  conservation. \nSpecific activities are: (a) develop district-level coastal and marine spatial plans; \n(b)  improve  MPA  effectiveness  including  approval  of  MPA  boundaries,  MPA \nboards, zoning and management plans and provide MPA goods and equipment; \n(c)  provide  integrated  coastal  zone  management  training,  including  climate \nchange adaptation; (d) assess coral reef fish stock and develop management \n                                                \n14 Project Contribution to Climate Change Adaptation and Mitigation in Marine Protected Areas (accessible from the \nlist of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n15 Further details of activities to be financed by the ADB loan and GEF grant are given in the design and monitoring \nframework (Appendix 1). \n ", "4 \nplans for selected coral reef fish, based on EAFM, at government\u2019s specified \nfisheries  management  area;  (e)  assess  district  fisheries  management \nperformance using EAFM indicators and provide training on EAFM; (f) develop \nand implement management plans for six threatened species; (g) pilot ecosystem \nvaluation  methodology,  strengthen  MPA  financial  management  capacity, \nmainstream biodiversity considerations in policies and plans, and pilot payment \nfor ecosystem services schemes; and (h) conduct studies and surveys to support \nsustainable fishing regulations, ecosystem approaches to fisheries management, \nand MPA networks.  \n(iii)  Sustainable  marine-based  livelihoods  improved.  This  output  will  build \ninfrastructure to support sustainable livelihoods and income-generating activities \nby (a) developing sustainable ecosystem-based coastal and marine enterprises \nwith  value  chains  linked  to  markets;  (b)  providing  basic  infrastructure  and \nequipment to MPA management boards and communities for improved income \ngeneration,  MPA  management,  and  social  welfare  through  public\u2013private \npartnerships; (c) developing community model enterprises to support sustainable \nlivelihoods, including assistance for feasibility studies and analysis of complete \nvalue chains; and (d) training district enterprise staff, community microenterprises, \nand  their  beneficiaries  on  business  and  sustainable  livelihoods  and  pilot \ncertification regimens. \n(iv)  Project management. This output will manage and implement project activities, \nand  also  institutionalize  national  coral  reef  management  arrangements.  The \nproject management office (PMO) will coordinate and monitor project activities, \nimplement the project performance monitoring system, conduct project evaluation \nsurveys, and prepare quarterly, annual, midterm, and project completion reports.  \n \n10.  The project is designed as a sector project, with an integrated focus on the government\u2019s \nsector  development  policies  and  plans  and  the  adequacy  of  institutions  to  formulate  and \nmanage these plans.16 The selection of subprojects within this sector modality will be based on \ndetailed technical, financial, economic, social, and environmental criteria that have been agreed \nwith  the  government  in  the  project  administration  manual.17 Key  criteria  require  that  the \nsubproject (i) contributes directly to environmentally sound resource utilization across MPAs, \n(ii) supports  development  of  sustainable  fisheries,  (iii)  contributes  to  fostering  sustainable \nlivelihoods that reduce fishing pressure or provide nontraditional gainful employment within the \nsector, and (iv) enhances effectiveness, governance, and financial sustainability of MPAs.  \n \n11.  Subprojects will be formulated and implemented using an embedded community-driven \ndevelopment (CDD) approach.18 Subproject design and development will follow a participatory \nplanning  and  demand-driven  approach  towards  identifying  a  package  of  investments  and \nactivities. The project will support the process of drafting the operational management plans for \nthe MPAs, which will be developed and validated through participatory processes. Innovative \nfinancing mechanisms, such as payment for ecosystem services, will be piloted.  \n \n12.  Experience  from  COREMAP  II  showed  that  some  livelihood  enterprises  were \nunsuccessful  and  unsustainable  due  to  insufficient  institutional  and  technical  support \nmechanisms as well as market connectivity.

Policies applicable to the \nsector are appropriate and will be improved, if warranted.   \n17  Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n18 Subproject is defined as an integrated package of investments and activities in a given MPA.  \n ", "5 \noutput  markets, will be  undertaken  during  preparation  of  each  subproject. This  will  enable \nspecification of the public infrastructure investment and associated technology, management, \noperational support, and training required. The actual mix of sustainable livelihood activities, \nincluding women-led microenterprises, will be finalized during implementation using CDD good \npractices. \n \n13.  Based  on  the  agreed  criteria,  two  representative  subprojects  were  identified  and \nappraised during project preparation, one for a national-level MPA (Anambas) and one for a \ndistrict-level  MPA  (Bintan).  These  subprojects  include  (i)  enabling  infrastructure  for  private \nsector participation in ecotourism development, (ii) fisheries productivity-related infrastructure, \n(iii)  sustainable  livelihood-related  infrastructure,  and  (iv)  MPA  governance. 19  Specific \nrepresentative  subproject  interventions  were  identified  based  on  consultations  with \ncommunities, district governments, the private sector, and civil society.  \n \nD.

DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical  \n \n18.  The formulation of subprojects for MPAs will follow a CDD approach and consultations \nwith local communities to ensure that (i) infrastructure and equipment to be provided under the \nproject are adapted to local conditions, and (ii) there is local capacity to implement, operate, and \nmaintain the infrastructure and equipment. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n \n19.  The project will support sustainable economic utilization of coastal and marine resources \nin the selected MPAs by fostering CDD. Within MPAs, coral reefs and mangroves provide \nsignificant potential for direct economic benefits from commercial fisheries, ecotourism, and \nmicroenterprise  development.  They  also  provide  combined  economic  and  environmental \nbenefits from the prevention of coastal erosion. MPA management effectiveness will be realized \nthrough  long-term  sustainability  of  MPA  resources  by  providing  coastal  communities  with \nopportunities for conservation-based financial gain from coral reef and mangrove resources. \n \n20.  An economic analysis has been undertaken of two sample MPAs to determine the \nviability of establishing effective MPA management to support a range of economic activities. \nThe benefits have been estimated based on economic values of coral reef and mangrove \nresources in terms of fisheries potential and erosion prevention, as well as the potential for \necotourism  development  based  on  the  contribution  of  tourism  to  gross  regional  domestic \nproduct. The economic internal rate of return (EIRR) is estimated at 15.3% for the national MPA \n(Anambas) and 42.1% for the district MPA (Bintan). The higher EIRR of Bintan reflects its larger \nand more valuable coral reef and mangrove areas than those in Anambas. A sensitivity analysis \nindicates  that  EIRRs  are  highly  robust  in  both  MPAs  with  respect  to  potentially  adverse \nmovements in key benefit and cost streams.20 \n \n21.  To reflect the financial benefits of the project to coastal communities that are dependent \nupon  resources  inside  MPAs,  a  financial  analysis  has  been  undertaken  of  a  range  of \nmicroenterprise aquaculture investments that could be supported under the project, subject to \nsatisfying selection criteria and detailed market and financial analyses. Financial internal rates \nof return range from 17% to over 50%. The project will enhance sustainability of aquaculture \ninvestments through effective microenterprise appraisal and by supporting complementary value \nchain investments to ensure adequate supply of quality inputs and access to market outlets. \n \nC.  Governance \n \n22.  Indonesia\u2019s public expenditure financial accountability assessment (2007) indicates that \nIndonesia has made significant improvements in the way its public finances are managed and in \nincreasing transparency and independent oversight.21 A sound regulatory framework is now in \nplace in almost all areas of public financial management. Key strengths pertain to transparent \nand comprehensive budget documentation, a well-defined budget process with both executive \nand legislative branches adhering to schedules, a classification that complies with international \nstandards, and a strengthened external audit function. New public financial management laws \n                                                \n20  Economic and Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).   \n21 World Bank. 2007.

Washington, DC. \n ", "8 \narticulate roles for Indonesia's Parliament, the government (through the Ministry of Finance), \nand  spending  agencies. Weaknesses  were  identified  across  various  dimensions  of  budget \nexecution, such as financial reporting and internal controls. ADB and the government have been \nworking in partnership to strengthen areas of improvement identified in the PEFA report. \n \n23.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government and MMAF. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures \nare described in the project administration manual (footnote 17). \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n \n24.  The project will support employment creation, livelihood development, and improvement \nof marine ecosystem and resource conditions, and will contribute to poverty reduction efforts of \nthe government. The primary beneficiaries of the project will be coastal communities in selected \nMPAs. Villagers in the project area, especially masyarakat adat (communities governed by \ncustoms), small fisher folk, and workers in the fishing industry, are highly dependent on coastal \nand marine resources for their livelihoods. The project will support at least 2,000 households to \nhelp  increase  their  incomes  by  developing  sustainable  livelihoods  through  marine-based \nenterprises.  Within  6  years  after  project  completion,  household  incomes  are  expected  to \nincrease by 10% to 15%. By focusing on business and vocational skill training, and by providing \nmarket linkages and technical assistance, the project will empower small entrepreneurs and \nprovide them with relevant experience. Learning networks and microenterprise models will help \nreplication in other villages and districts. The country\u2019s economic indicators, a summary poverty \nreduction and social strategy, and a gender action plan are available in linked documents.22 \n \n25.  Local communities and institutions will be strengthened to co-manage and promote coral \nreef conservation through MPA management institutions. The project will strengthen capacities \nof  stakeholders  for  decentralized  co-management  of  MPAs  through  a  CDD  approach. \nCommunities will have a role in selection of subproject activities within defined selection criteria, \nand will participate in development of coral reef management plans and policies.23 Communities \nwill also be involved in planning, design, implementation, and monitoring of (i) small-scale \ninfrastructure through a community contracting process; (ii) sustainable livelihood development \nby taking a lead role in its development, promotion, and implementation; and (iii) biodiversity \nmanagement in partnership with nongovernment organizations and the private sector.  \n \n26.  Gender and development. The project is classified as effective gender mainstreaming \nas it is designed to benefit women by (i) increasing their participation and decision-making in \nnatural resource management at community and local government levels, and (ii) providing \nthem with improved access to services. The project will facilitate women\u2019s active participation in \nsetting up, operating, and managing small-scale income-generating projects. The PMO will \nensure  that  strengthening  of  pokmas  will  provide  equitable  opportunities  for  women\u2019s \nmembership and representation, and opportunities for them to take decision-making functions. \nTechnical and life skills training will be provided according to women's needs and aspirations, \nincluding establishing and strengthening women\u2019s groups and community mentoring programs. \nAt least 30% of participants in marine-based livelihood training are targeted to be women. \n \n                                                \n22Country  Economic  Indicators,  Summary  Poverty  Reduction  and  Social  Strategy,  and  Gender  Action  Plan \n(accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n23  Examples are integrated coastal zone management, MPA management and zoning plans, and sustainable \nfisheries regulations. \n ", "9 \nE.  Safeguards \n \n27.  Environment  (category  B).  The  project  will  undertake  small-scale  activities  like \n(i) infrastructure to support MPA operations; (ii) ecotourism; and (iii) livelihood activities that \ncause minimal potential disturbances to the environment. These can be easily mitigated with \nproper  site  selection,  environmentally  friendly  construction  technology,  best  practices \nto minimize  pollution  during  construction,  and  proper  waste  disposal.  An  environmental \nassessment and review framework has been prepared and will guide environmental screening \nand  categorization  of  project  interventions  and  identify  potential  impacts  and  mitigating \nmeasures.24 Two  sample  subproject  initial  environment  examinations  were  prepared  and \nanalyzed to provide prototypes for identifying typical impacts of potential interventions. The \nenvironmental  assessment  and  review  framework  and  the  two  sample  subproject  initial \nenvironmental  examinations  were  endorsed  by  the  government  and  disclosed  on  ADB\u2019s \nwebsite. \n \n28.  Involuntary resettlement (category B). Screening of socioeconomic infrastructure will \neliminate subprojects with significant land acquisition or resettlement impacts. A land acquisition \nand resettlement framework (LARF) has been prepared, endorsed by the government, and \ndisclosed on ADB\u2019s website.25 Given the project\u2019s CDD approach, infrastructure will be selected \nafter project approval. A resettlement plan will then be prepared for each subproject, in line with \nthe LARF and in consultation with and disclosed to affected persons. The LARF provides for \ntransparent procedures and record-keeping for land donation and transactions involving willing \nbuyer and willing seller. It also includes a well-defined consultation mechanism, an entitlement \nmatrix, and a grievance redress mechanism. The MMAF has dedicated staff to implement social \nand environment safeguards. The MMAF\u2019s project safeguards staff, supported by consultants, \nwill implement the LARF, including preparation of resettlement plans. Project implementers will \nbe  trained  to  operationalize  the  LARF  consistent  with  government  policies  on  involuntary \nresettlement.  \n \n29.  Indigenous people (category B). Six masyarakat adat were identified in the project \narea. In Mentawai district, indigenous peoples are leaders of local government, but in other \ndistricts they are not dominant. Overall, indigenous peoples\u2019 concerns on cultural integrity and \nlivelihoods are built into project design using a CDD approach, resulting in positive impacts. An \nindigenous peoples planning framework (IPPF) has been prepared, reflecting the requirements \nof ADB\u2019s safeguard policies, which has been endorsed by the government and disclosed on \nADB\u2019s  website.26 The  IPPF  will  screen  potential  negative  impacts,  outline  a  strategy  for \nbeneficial measures for indigenous peoples, and guide preparation of subproject indigenous \npeoples plans. These plans will be prepared after project approval, in consultation with and \ndisclosed to indigenous peoples communities. The government has agreed to allocate adequate \nresources to implement the IPPF and safeguard the rights of indigenous peoples, including \nallocating 2% of the livelihoods budget for indigenous peoples\u2019 community activities. The PMO \nwill have full-time, qualified and experienced staff, supported by nongovernment organizations \nand consulting firms with a local presence and/or partnerships (if required) to ensure that plans \nare diligently implemented. Project implementers will be trained in operationalizing the IPPF.  \n \n \n                                                \n24  Environmental Assessment and Review Framework (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n25 Land Acquisition and Resettlement Framework (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n26 Indigenous Peoples Planning Framework (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "10 \nF.
