The  COREMAP\u2014CTI \nwill  support  the  government\u2019s  sector  development  plan  and  national  targets  for  establishing \neffective  marine  protected  areas  (MPAs).2 Project  implementation  will  focus  on  improving  the \nmanagement, sustainability, and resilience of MPAs. The project area comprises seven district \nMPAs  located  in  Bintan,  Batam,  Lingga,  and  Natuna  districts  in  Kepulauan  Riau  province; \nCentral Tapanuli and North Nias districts in North Sumatra province; Mentawai district in West \nSumatra province; and three national MPAs, namely, Anambas in Anambas district, Kepulauan \nRiau province; Pulau Pieh in Pariaman district, West Sumatra province; and Gilimatra in North \nLombok district, West Nusa Tenggara province.3  \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\n \nA. \n\nRationale \n\n3. \nIndonesia  is  the  world\u2019s largest  archipelagic  nation,  with  18%  of the  world\u2019s  coral  reefs \nthat host diverse marine flora and fauna.4 Indonesia\u2019s coastal ecosystems serve as an important \nbase for the country\u2019s economic growth. Sustainable management of the coral reef ecosystem \nis  therefore  a  major  objective  of  Indonesia\u2019s  marine  and  fisheries  sector  development  plan, \nwhich is guided by (i) the National Long-Term Development Plan, 2005\u20132025, (ii) the Medium-\nTerm  Development  Plan,  2010\u20132014,  and  (iii)  the  Ministry  of  Marine  Affairs  and  Fisheries \n(MMAF)  Strategic  Plan,  2010\u20132014.5 The  government  has  policies  to  address  sector  issues \nrelating  to  coastal  and  marine  resource  management.6 Collectively,  these  policies  and  plans \narticulate the government\u2019s priorities for the sector and comprise the sector development plan. \nIndonesia has also played a central role in the Coral Triangle Initiative on Coral Reefs, Fisheries \nand Food Security, a six-country program of regional cooperation to sustainably manage coastal \nand marine resources in the region.7 \n \n\n                                                 \n1   The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  Sector Assessment (Summary): Agriculture, Natural Resources and Environment (Marine and Fishery Subsector) \n\n(accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n3   The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  provided  project  preparatory  technical  assistance.

At the First Ministerial Meeting in 2009, these governments agreed \nto adopt a 10-year CTI Regional Plan of Action to safeguard the region\u2019s marine and coastal biological resources. \nOne of the CTI goals is to establish a fully functioning and effectively managed region-wide Coral Triangle Marine \nProtected Area System. http://www.coraltriangleinitiative.org/ \n\n\f2 \n\nLow  awareness  of  coastal  communities  on  coral  reef  conservation,  inadequate \n4. \ninstitutional  capacity  to  contain  land-  and  marine-based  pollution,  insufficient  institutional \nframeworks  and  capacity  to  effectively  manage MPAs,  and  persistent  poverty  in  coastal  areas \nhave  resulted  in  degradation  of  about  70%  of  Indonesia\u2019s  coral  reef  ecosystem.8 To  address \nthese root causes, the Government of Indonesia has adopted a multifaceted approach focusing \non  (i)  institutional  capacity  building, (ii)  development  of models for  establishment  and  effective \nmanagement  of  MPAs,  and  (iii)  reduction  of  coastal  poverty  through  income-generating \ninfrastructure  and  sustainable  livelihoods.  This  project  represents  the  last  of  a  three-phase \nprogram in which the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the World Bank are working in close \ncooperation  with  the  government  in  complementary  geographic  areas. 9  The  first  phase \n(COREMAP I) established a viable framework for a national coral reef management system in \nIndonesia.10 The  second  phase  (COREMAP  II)  consolidated  the  knowledge  base,  adopted  a \ncommunity-based  approach  for  decentralized  coral  reef  management,  and  built  strong  public \nawareness  on  coral  reef  conservation. 11 COREMAP  II  initiated  institutional  development  for \nmodel  MPA  systems  and  tested  the  feasibility  of  sustainable  livelihood  activities  for  reducing \nfishing pressures in targeted coastal communities. ADB and the World Bank project completion \nreports  for  COREMAP  II  described  several  lessons  that  have  been  incorporated  in  the \nCOREMAP\u2014CTI  project  design.  These  include  the  need  for  (i)  commitment  and  support  from \nlocal  government  bodies,  (ii)  integration  of  value  chain  analysis  of  livelihood  activities  in  the \nproject design, and (iii) effective mainstreaming of gender concerns. \n \n5. \nThe  project  will  contribute  to  meeting  the  government\u2019s  marine  and  fisheries  sector \ndevelopment plan\u2019s overall targets to establish 20.0 million hectares of effective MPAs by 2020 \n(of  which  15.7  million  hectares  were  established  by  2012)  and  to  effectively  manage  15 \nthreatened,  endangered,  and  endemic  species.  This  consolidation  phase  will  develop  model \nMPAs  with  effective  management,  financial  sustainability,  capacity \nfor  community  co-\nmanagement, and enforcement of regulations. The project will also create models of sustainable \nmicroenterprise  models  for  communities.  The  project  is  aligned  with  Indonesia\u2019s  country \npartnership  strategy,  2012\u20132014  with  regard to  its two  strategic  pillars  of  inclusive  growth  and \nenvironmental sustainability. The project is also aligned with Indonesia\u2019s National Plan of Action \nfor the CTI12 and ADB\u2019s package of technical assistance support to implement this plan.13 \n \nClimate  change-induced  ocean  temperature  increase,  sea  level  rise,  and  ocean \n6. \nacidification have adverse impacts on coral reef ecosystems and biodiversity. MPAs, as carbon \nsinks,  mitigate  climate  change  by  protecting  and  enhancing  habitats  such  as  coral  reefs, \nmangroves,  and  sea  grasses.  Several  project  locations  have  seen  climate  change-induced \ntemperature rise impacting coral reefs through coral bleaching. The project\u2019s focus on effective \nMPA  management,  support  for  integrated  coastal  zone  management,  sustainable  livelihoods, \nand public awareness activities will enhance resilience of coral reef ecosystems and contribute \nto  adaptive  capacity  of  target  coastal  communities  to  climate  change  impacts.

This  will  strengthen \ncapacity  developed  under  COREMAP  II  and  institutionalize  community-based \ncoral  reef  management  initiatives  within  existing  government  legal  systems  and \ninstitutions  by  (a)  incorporating  roles  and  responsibilities  of  lembaga  pengelola \nsumberdaya  terumbu  karang  (community  coral  reef  resource  management \ninstitutions) in village administrative structures through regulations; (b) upgrading \ninformation  centers  established  under  COREMAP  II  into  resource  centers; \n(c) providing  support  and  mentoring  by  MMAF  extension  workers  to  district-level \nimplementing agencies\u2019 staff to mainstream a community coral reef management \napproach;  (d)  establishing  learning  networks  of  fishing  communities,  MPA \nmanagers, and local government officials to learn from each other and adopt best \nthe \npractices;  (e)  conducting  socioeconomic  and  ecological  surveys  by \nIndonesian Institute of Sciences (LIPI); (f) developing a decentralized certification \nprogram  by  LIPI  for  ecological  benefit  monitoring;  (g)  upgrading  the  coral  reef \nmanagement  information  system  to  include  web-based  user  data  access  and \nreporting; (h) conducting teacher training on local content curriculum; (i) providing \na  postgraduate  program  for  Directorate  General  of  Capture  Fisheries  staff  to \ndevelop  sustainable  fisheries  management  expertise;  (j)  strengthening  MPA \nsurveillance  by  providing  equipment,  infrastructure,  policies,  monitoring,  control, \nand  joint  patrols  (inter-agency  and  community  surveillance  groups);  and  (k) \nconducting  training  on  conservation,  coastal  management,  ecosystem  approach \nto fisheries management (EAFM), ecosystem monitoring, and data management. \nEcosystem-based  resource  management  developed.  This  output  will \nstrengthen  MPA  management  effectiveness  and  biodiversity  conservation. \nSpecific  activities  are:  (a)  develop  district-level  coastal  and  marine  spatial  plans; \n(b)  improve  MPA  effectiveness  including  approval  of  MPA  boundaries,  MPA \nboards, zoning and management plans and provide  MPA goods and equipment; \n(c)  provide  integrated  coastal  zone  management  training,  including  climate \nchange  adaptation;  (d)  assess  coral  reef  fish  stock  and  develop  management \n\n                                                 \n14 Project Contribution to Climate Change Adaptation and Mitigation in Marine Protected Areas (accessible from the \n\n15 Further details of activities to be financed by the ADB loan and GEF grant are given in the design and monitoring \n\nlist of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\nframework (Appendix 1). \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\f(iii) \n\n(e)  assess  district \n\nplans  for  selected  coral  reef  fish,  based  on  EAFM,  at  government\u2019s  specified \nfisheries  management  area; \nfisheries  management \nperformance  using  EAFM  indicators  and  provide  training  on  EAFM;  (f)  develop \nand implement management plans for six threatened species; (g) pilot ecosystem \nfinancial  management  capacity, \nvaluation  methodology,  strengthen  MPA \nmainstream  biodiversity  considerations  in  policies  and  plans,  and  pilot  payment \nfor ecosystem services schemes; and (h) conduct studies and surveys to support \nsustainable fishing regulations, ecosystem approaches to fisheries management, \nand MPA networks.  \nSustainable  marine-based \nimproved.  This  output  will  build \ninfrastructure  to  support  sustainable  livelihoods  and  income-generating  activities \nby  (a)  developing  sustainable  ecosystem-based  coastal  and  marine  enterprises \nwith  value  chains  linked  to  markets;  (b)  providing  basic  infrastructure  and \nequipment  to  MPA  management  boards  and  communities  for  improved  income \ngeneration,  MPA  management,  and  social  welfare \nthrough  public\u2013private \npartnerships; (c) developing community model enterprises to support sustainable \nlivelihoods,  including  assistance  for  feasibility  studies  and  analysis  of  complete \nvalue chains; and (d) training district enterprise staff, community microenterprises, \nand  their  beneficiaries  on  business  and  sustainable  livelihoods  and  pilot \ncertification regimens. \n\nlivelihoods \n\n(iv)  Project  management. This  output  will  manage  and  implement  project activities, \nand  also  institutionalize  national  coral  reef  management  arrangements.  The \nproject  management  office  (PMO)  will  coordinate  and  monitor  project  activities, \nimplement the project performance monitoring system, conduct project evaluation \nsurveys, and prepare quarterly, annual, midterm, and project completion reports.  \n\n \n10. \nThe project is designed as a sector project, with an integrated focus on the government\u2019s \nsector  development  policies  and  plans  and  the  adequacy  of  institutions  to  formulate  and \nmanage these plans.16 The selection of subprojects within this sector modality will be based on \ndetailed technical, financial, economic, social, and environmental criteria that have been agreed \nwith  the  government  in  the  project  administration  manual. 17  Key  criteria  require  that  the \nsubproject  (i)  contributes  directly  to  environmentally  sound  resource  utilization  across  MPAs, \n(ii) supports  development  of  sustainable  fisheries,  (iii)  contributes  to  fostering  sustainable \nlivelihoods that reduce fishing pressure or provide nontraditional gainful employment within the \nsector, and (iv) enhances effectiveness, governance, and financial sustainability of MPAs.  \n \nSubprojects will be formulated and implemented using an embedded community-driven \n11. \ndevelopment  (CDD)  approach.18 Subproject  design  and  development  will  follow  a  participatory \nplanning  and  demand-driven  approach  towards  identifying  a  package  of  investments  and \nactivities. The project will support the process of drafting the operational management plans for \nthe  MPAs,  which  will  be  developed  and  validated  through  participatory  processes.  Innovative \nfinancing mechanisms, such as payment for ecosystem services, will be piloted.  \n \n12. \nlivelihood  enterprises  were \ntechnical  support \nunsuccessful  and  unsustainable  due \nmechanisms as well as market connectivity.

Within  MPAs,  coral  reefs  and  mangroves  provide \nsignificant  potential  for  direct  economic  benefits  from  commercial  fisheries,  ecotourism,  and \nmicroenterprise  development.  They  also  provide  combined  economic  and  environmental \nbenefits from the prevention of coastal erosion. MPA management effectiveness will be realized \nthrough  long-term  sustainability  of  MPA  resources  by  providing  coastal  communities  with \nopportunities for conservation-based financial gain from coral reef and mangrove resources. \n \n20. \nAn  economic  analysis  has  been  undertaken  of  two  sample  MPAs  to  determine  the \nviability  of  establishing  effective  MPA  management  to  support  a  range  of  economic  activities. \nThe  benefits  have  been  estimated  based  on  economic  values  of  coral  reef  and  mangrove \nresources  in  terms  of  fisheries  potential  and  erosion  prevention,  as  well  as  the  potential  for \necotourism  development  based  on  the  contribution  of  tourism  to  gross  regional  domestic \nproduct. The economic internal rate of return (EIRR) is estimated at 15.3% for the national MPA \n(Anambas) and 42.1% for the district MPA (Bintan). The higher EIRR of Bintan reflects its larger \nand more valuable coral reef and mangrove areas than those in Anambas. A sensitivity analysis \nindicates  that  EIRRs  are  highly  robust  in  both  MPAs  with  respect  to  potentially  adverse \nmovements in key benefit and cost streams.20 \n \n21. \nTo reflect the financial benefits of the project to coastal communities that are dependent \nupon  resources  inside  MPAs,  a  financial  analysis  has  been  undertaken  of  a  range  of \nmicroenterprise  aquaculture  investments  that  could  be  supported  under  the  project,  subject  to \nsatisfying selection  criteria  and  detailed market  and financial  analyses.  Financial  internal  rates \nof  return  range  from  17%  to  over  50%.  The  project  will  enhance  sustainability  of  aquaculture \ninvestments through effective microenterprise appraisal and by supporting complementary value \nchain investments to ensure adequate supply of quality inputs and access to market outlets. \n \nC. \n \nIndonesia\u2019s public expenditure financial accountability assessment (2007) indicates that \n22. \nIndonesia has made significant improvements in the way its public finances are managed and in \nincreasing  transparency  and  independent  oversight.21 A  sound  regulatory  framework  is  now  in \nplace  in  almost  all  areas  of  public financial management.  Key  strengths  pertain to  transparent \nand  comprehensive  budget  documentation,  a  well-defined  budget  process  with  both  executive \nand legislative branches adhering to schedules, a classification that complies with international \nstandards,  and  a  strengthened  external  audit function.

Weaknesses  were  identified  across  various  dimensions  of  budget \nexecution, such as financial reporting and internal controls. ADB and the government have been \nworking in partnership to strengthen areas of improvement identified in the PEFA report. \n \n23. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government and MMAF. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures \nare described in the project administration manual (footnote 17). \n \nD. \n \n24. \nThe project will support employment creation, livelihood development, and improvement \nof marine ecosystem and resource conditions, and will contribute to poverty reduction efforts of \nthe government. The primary beneficiaries of the project will be coastal communities in selected \nMPAs.  Villagers  in  the  project  area,  especially  masyarakat  adat  (communities  governed  by \ncustoms), small fisher folk, and workers in the fishing industry, are highly dependent on coastal \nand marine resources for their livelihoods. The project will support at least 2,000 households to \nhelp  increase  their  incomes  by  developing  sustainable  livelihoods  through  marine-based \nenterprises.  Within  6  years  after  project  completion,  household  incomes  are  expected  to \nincrease by 10% to 15%. By focusing on business and vocational skill training, and by providing \nmarket  linkages  and  technical  assistance,  the  project  will  empower  small  entrepreneurs  and \nprovide them with relevant experience. Learning networks and microenterprise models will help \nreplication in other villages and districts. The country\u2019s economic indicators, a summary poverty \nreduction and social strategy, and a gender action plan are available in linked documents.22 \n \n25. \nLocal communities and institutions will be strengthened to co-manage and promote coral \nreef conservation through MPA management institutions. The project will strengthen capacities \nof  stakeholders  for  decentralized  co-management  of  MPAs  through  a  CDD  approach. \nCommunities will have a role in selection of subproject activities within defined selection criteria, \nand will participate in development of coral reef management plans and policies.23 Communities \nwill  also  be  involved  in  planning,  design,  implementation,  and  monitoring  of  (i)  small-scale \ninfrastructure through a community contracting process; (ii) sustainable livelihood development \nby  taking  a  lead  role  in  its  development,  promotion,  and  implementation;  and  (iii)  biodiversity \nmanagement in partnership with nongovernment organizations and the private sector.  \n \n26. \nGender  and  development. The project is classified as effective gender mainstreaming \nas  it  is  designed  to  benefit  women  by  (i)  increasing  their  participation  and  decision-making  in \nnatural  resource  management  at  community  and  local  government  levels,  and  (ii)  providing \nthem with improved access to services. The project will facilitate women\u2019s active participation in \nsetting  up,  operating,  and  managing  small-scale  income-generating  projects.  The  PMO  will \nensure  that  strengthening  of  pokmas  will  provide  equitable  opportunities  for  women\u2019s \nmembership and representation, and opportunities for them to take decision-making functions. \nTechnical  and  life  skills  training  will  be  provided  according  to  women's  needs  and  aspirations, \nincluding establishing and strengthening women\u2019s groups and community mentoring programs. \nAt least 30% of participants in marine-based livelihood training are targeted to be women. \n \n\n                                                 \n22 Country  Economic  Indicators,  Summary  Poverty  Reduction  and  Social  Strategy,  and  Gender  Action  Plan \n\n(accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n23  Examples  are  integrated  coastal  zone  management,  MPA  management  and  zoning  plans,  and  sustainable \n\nfisheries regulations. \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\fSafeguards \n\nfriendly  construction \n\nE. \n \n27. \nEnvironment  (category  B).  The  project  will  undertake  small-scale  activities  like \n(i) infrastructure  to  support  MPA  operations;  (ii)  ecotourism;  and  (iii)  livelihood  activities  that \ncause  minimal  potential  disturbances  to  the  environment.  These  can  be  easily  mitigated  with \nproper  site  selection,  environmentally \ntechnology,  best  practices \nto minimize  pollution  during  construction,  and  proper  waste  disposal.  An  environmental \nassessment and review  framework has been prepared and will guide environmental screening \nand  categorization  of  project  interventions  and  identify  potential  impacts  and  mitigating \nmeasures. 24  Two  sample  subproject  initial  environment  examinations  were  prepared  and \nanalyzed  to  provide  prototypes  for  identifying  typical  impacts  of  potential  interventions.  The \nenvironmental  assessment  and  review  framework  and  the  two  sample  subproject  initial \nenvironmental  examinations  were  endorsed  by  the  government  and  disclosed  on  ADB\u2019s \nwebsite. \n \n28. \nInvoluntary  resettlement  (category  B). Screening of socioeconomic infrastructure will \neliminate subprojects with significant land acquisition or resettlement impacts. A land acquisition \nand  resettlement  framework  (LARF)  has  been  prepared,  endorsed  by  the  government,  and \ndisclosed on ADB\u2019s website.25 Given the project\u2019s CDD approach, infrastructure will be selected \nafter project approval. A resettlement plan will then be prepared for each subproject, in line with \nthe  LARF  and  in  consultation  with  and  disclosed  to  affected  persons.  The  LARF  provides  for \ntransparent procedures and record-keeping for land donation and transactions involving willing \nbuyer and willing seller. It also includes a well-defined consultation mechanism, an entitlement \nmatrix, and a grievance redress mechanism. The MMAF has dedicated staff to implement social \nand  environment  safeguards. The  MMAF\u2019s  project  safeguards staff,  supported  by  consultants, \nwill implement the LARF, including preparation of resettlement plans. Project implementers will \nbe  trained  to  operationalize  the  LARF  consistent  with  government  policies  on  involuntary \nresettlement.  \n \n29. \nIndigenous  people  (category  B).  Six  masyarakat  adat  were  identified  in  the  project \narea.  In  Mentawai  district,  indigenous  peoples  are  leaders  of  local  government,  but  in  other \ndistricts they  are  not  dominant. Overall,  indigenous  peoples\u2019 concerns  on  cultural  integrity  and \nlivelihoods are built into project design using a CDD approach, resulting in positive impacts. An \nindigenous peoples planning framework (IPPF) has been prepared, reflecting the requirements \nof  ADB\u2019s  safeguard  policies,  which  has  been  endorsed  by  the  government  and  disclosed  on \nADB\u2019s  website. 26  The  IPPF  will  screen  potential  negative  impacts,  outline  a  strategy  for \nbeneficial  measures  for  indigenous  peoples,  and  guide  preparation  of  subproject  indigenous \npeoples  plans.  These  plans  will  be  prepared  after  project  approval,  in  consultation  with  and \ndisclosed to indigenous peoples communities. The government has agreed to allocate adequate \nresources  to  implement  the  IPPF  and  safeguard  the  rights  of  indigenous  peoples,  including \nallocating 2% of the livelihoods budget for indigenous peoples\u2019 community activities. The PMO \nwill  have  full-time, qualified  and  experienced  staff,  supported  by  nongovernment  organizations \nand consulting firms with a local presence and/or partnerships (if required) to ensure that plans \nare diligently implemented. Project implementers will be trained in operationalizing the IPPF.  \n \n \n\n                                                 \n24  Environmental Assessment and Review Framework (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n25 Land Acquisition and Resettlement Framework (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n26 Indigenous Peoples Planning Framework (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\fRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\nF. \n \n30. \nThe integrated benefits and positive impacts of the project are expected to outweigh the \ncosts.
