THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nthe Kingdom of Thailand for the Greater Mekong Subregion Highway Expansion Phase 2 Project.  \n \n2.  The proposed project will (i) upgrade about 125 kilometers (km) of national highway in the \nnortheastern region of Thailand from two-lane highway to four-lane highway; and (ii) strengthen \ncapacity in road safety management by introducing road safety audits and road safety awareness \ntraining for the executing agency during project implementation. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  As the second-largest economy in Southeast Asia, Thailand\u2019s development potential is \nstrong. Since the late 1980s, Thailand has made remarkable progress in social and economic \ndevelopment, moving from a low-income country to an upper middle-income country (UMIC) in \n2011. Thailand\u2019s economy is diversified, and manufacturing is the main sector contributing to \neconomic growth. Transport infrastructure is an important component of the economy for the \nmobility of goods and people to provide access to economic opportunities and social services.   \n \n4.  Transport sector and government sector strategy. Thailand\u2019s transport sector is more \ndeveloped than its immediate Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) neighbors including Cambodia, \nthe Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR), and Myanmar. Thailand depends heavily on \nroad transport for economic activities. The road transport subsector serves 98% of passenger \ntraffic and 95% of freight traffic in the country. The road network has a total length of 471,010 km, \ncomprising 70,660 km of highways, 350 km of controlled-access expressways or motorways, and \nabout 400,000 km of local roads.1 More than 98% of the road network is paved to an all-weather \nstandard,  and  has  been  extended  nationwide  to  reach  more  than  98.5%  of  the  country\u2019s \npopulation. The railway network covers 4,043 km, and serves the capital Bangkok and 47 of the \ncountry\u2019s 76 provinces. More than 90% of the railway network is single-track lines. Railways play \na small role in passenger and freight traffic. For urban transport, most person trips are made by \nprivate mode in major cities in Thailand, including Bangkok. Aimed at developing Thailand as a \nregional hub in the GMS, the government\u2019s transport sector development strategy is to improve \nroad and rail infrastructure and urban transport. The strategic goal is to strengthen connectivity \nthroughout the country by expanding the road network, transforming railway lines from single \ntrack to double track, introducing high-speed rail, and building an urban mass rapid transit system.                 \n \n5.  Road  transport  subsector  development.  Recognizing  that  an  efficient  national \nconnectivity is essential for further economic development and poverty reduction, the government \nhas embarked on a national transport development plan since 2012. The plan aims to address \nkey  binding  constraints  and  strengthen  efficiency  in  the  road  transport  subsector  through \nsubstantial improvements in software and hardware.2 The key achievements of the plan are \ncapacity strengthening in policy planning, programming and implementation of road transport \nprojects,  the  introduction  of  a  competitive  and  transparent  procurement  system,  and  the \nconstruction of about 5,000 km of a new highway network. Despite these positive developments \n                                                \n1  Government  of  Thailand,  Ministry  of Transport,  Office  of  The  Permanent  Secretary.  2016.

Bangkok.  ", "2 \nand achievements, Thailand\u2019s transport sector still faces key challenges. These include an \ninefficient national highway network and poor road safety. \n \n6.  Inefficient national highway network. Much of the existing highway network is operating \nabove capacity, resulting in congestion and inefficient movement of goods and people. The \ncapacity of the existing roads is determined by highway widths and the number of lanes. About \n17% of the 70,660 km highway network in the country are four-lane highways, while the rest are \ntwo-lane highways.3 The road capacity of the highway network is limited by the two-lane highway \nconfiguration, leading to inefficient national connectivity for the movement of goods and people.4 \nFrom 1995 to the present, the government has upgraded 4,197 km of national highways with high \ntraffic volumes from single two-lane to divided four-lane highways. Continued investment in \nupgrading national highways from two-lane to four-lane highways is required to ensure that the \nnetwork has adequate road capacity for efficient transport to support economic development. \n \n7.  Poor road safety. The country\u2019s road safety is a key concern. In 2015, 71,054 traffic \naccidents and 6,432 deaths from those accidents were recorded, producing a fatality rate of \n9.6 per 100,000 people. 5 Though the number of deaths in traffic accidents have been declining \nsince 2014, Thailand still has one of the poorest road accident and fatality records among the \nmembers of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. 6 The poor road safety is attributed to \ninadequate safety features in road projects.               \n \n8.  Geographic disparities. Provinces in the northeastern region of Thailand are among the \npoorest in the country. 7 The average gross domestic product per capita of the northeastern region \nin 2015 was $2,030, which is only slightly greater than a third of the national average gross \ndomestic product per capita of $5,890 in 2015.8 The GMS East\u2013West Economic Corridor (EWEC), \nwhich runs from Viet Nam through the Lao PDR and Thailand to Myanmar, linking economic \ncenters in the GMS, crosses northeastern Thailand. The development potential of the region is \nstrong, as the EWEC could serve as a powerful engine for regional integration and inclusive \neconomic growth.9 However, such potential has not been fully tapped because of two crucial \nfactors in the transport sector: an inefficient highway network resulting from inadequate road \ncapacity, and poor road safety. Investment in transport infrastructure in the northeastern region \nis vital to help unleash development potential for regional integration and inclusive economic \ngrowth.   \n    \n9.  Strategic context. Strengthening national connectivity in poorer provinces to enhance \naccess  to  social  and  economic  opportunities  in  support  of  inclusive  growth  and  regional \n                                                \n3  Government of Thailand, Ministry of Transport. 2015. Transport Infrastructure Development Plan. Bangkok. \n4  The standard design lane width for national highways is 3.5 meters per lane. The capacity of two-lane highways is \n2,000 vehicles per hour while that of divided four-lane highways is 6,000 vehicles per hour. Divided four-lane \nhighways have a central reservation to separate traffic traveling in opposite directions, resulting in higher speed and \ncapacity, and improved safety by reducing the incidence of head-on collisions.  \n5  Royal Thai Police. 2015.

National Economic \nand Social Statistics 2015. Bangkok. \n9  Along the GMS EWEC, the total trade value at the Mukdahan (Thailand)\u2013Savannakhet (Lao PDR) border increased \nfrom 2010 ($97 million) to 2015 ($203 million), while at the Mae Sot (Thailand)\u2013 Myawaddy (Myanmar) border, trade \nincreased by 73% from 2010 ($85 million) to 2015 ($148 million). Expansion of the EWEC catchment by improving \nthe road network will help realize broader economic benefits and regional integration. \n \n ", "3 \nintegration  is  one  of  the  priority  policy  items  in  the  12th  National  Economic  and  Social \nDevelopment Plan, 2017\u20132021.10 The project is in line with the government\u2019s development \nstrategy to improve national connectivity throughout the country. The country partnership strategy, \n2013\u20132016  for  Thailand  also  emphasizes  transport  infrastructure  development  to  improve \ndomestic connectivity, which contributes to inclusive growth and regional integration.11 \n \n10.  Lessons. In 2009, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided a loan to Thailand for the \nGMS Highway Expansion Project, which improved national highways along GMS EWEC and \nSouthern Economic Corridor.12 Upon the successful completion of the GMS Highway Expansion \nProject in 2016, the government requested ADB to provide a new project loan to finance this \nphase 2 project.13 Key lessons are that giving attention to project readiness at planning stage, \nand providing up-front support to the executing agency on procurement will facilitate effective \nproject implementation.  \n \n11.  The proposed project will improve National Highway 22 and National Highway 23 in \nnortheast Thailand, which are key link roads near the EWEC. On National Highway 22, the annual \naverage daily traffic is about 12,000. The annual average daily traffic on National Highway 23 is \nabout 15,000. To address such large traffic volumes, the government is upgrading National \nHighway 22 and National Highway 23 to divided four-lane highways. The proposed project will \ncontinue the government initiative by upgrading the remaining sections of National Highway 22 \nand National Highway 23, which are currently single two-lane highways.  \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n12.  The  project  is  aligned  with  the  following  impact:  access  to  social  and  economic \nopportunities enhanced (footnote 10). The project will have the following outcome: efficiency and \nsafety of movements of goods and people on project roads improved.14 \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n13.  Output 1: Sections of National Highway 22 and National Highway 23 upgraded. A \ntotal of about 125 km sections of National Highway 22 and National Highway 23 will be upgraded \nfrom single two-lane highways to divided four-lane highways. Road sections under the project for \nupgrading are from Nong Han to Phang Khon (about 37 km) and from Sakon Nakhon to Nakhon \nPhanom (about 33 km) of National Highway 22, and a section from Roi Et to Yasothon (about 55 \nkm) of National Highway 23.     \n \n14.  Output 2: Capacity in road safety management strengthened. To enhance the road \nsafety features of the proposed upgrading of National Highway 22 and National Highway 23, the \nroad design will be subjected to detailed road safety audits before construction commences, \nduring construction, and before final acceptance of the completed roads. The project will also \nstrengthen the government\u2019s capacity in road safety management through safety awareness \ntraining and hands-on experience in road safety audits. \n                                                \n10 Government of Thailand, Office of the National Economic and Social Development Board. 2016. 12th National \nEconomic and Social Development Plan, 2017\u20132021.

Value added by ADB. ADB will add value to the project primarily by including international \nbest practice in procurement and road safety. Throughout the project preparation, ADB shared \nexpertise  on  improving  procurement  efficiency.  This  will  continue  throughout  project \nimplementation  to  promote  open  competition  and  support  the  government\u2019s  procurement \noversight and progress monitoring. Better road safety management, brought about by output 2, \nwill improve the capacity of the executing agency in implementing other road projects. \n \nD.  Summary Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n \n16.  The project is estimated to cost $213.6 million (Table 1). \n \n17.  Detailed cost estimates by expenditure category and by financier are included in the \nproject administration manual (PAM).15 The major expenditure items that constitute the project \nare civil works and consulting services.  \n \nTable 1: Summary Cost Estimates \n($ million) \nItem  Amounta \nA.

Special  financing  feature  to  meet  the  government\u2019s  need.  ADB\u2019s  UMICs  are \nsophisticated and heterogeneous, and each of them faces various development challenges. Use \nof a uniform ADB lending approach is less likely to meet their individual development needs. \nSome UMICs including Thailand are pressing ADB, to varying degrees, to be more responsive to \n ", "6 \ntheir requirements and effective in delivering the desired outcomes. The government recognizes \nforeign exchange management as the key issue for borrowing in foreign currency to finance \ninfrastructure projects. Since the project expenses are expected to be largely paid in baht, while \nthe ADB project loan proceeds are in United States (US) dollars, this creates a currency mismatch \nin project financing using ADB loan. The government is also exposed to foreign exchange and \ninterest rate risks with liability in US dollars when taking an ADB London interbank offered rate-\nbased loan (LBL). \n \n22.  The  government  adopts  an  established  two-step  strategy  to  address  the  currency \nmismatch and hedge the financial risks arising from foreign borrowing. First, the entire loan \nproceeds from US dollars will be converted to baht to lock up the currency for project expenses. \nSecond, a cross currency interest rate swap agreement with a commercial counterpart will be \nexecuted to manage the financial risk exposure resulting from the ADB loan. \n  \n23.  To help the government manage the foreign exchange and interest rate risks effectively, \nas a pilot project, this ADB loan will feature a single tranche disbursement arrangement. This will \nallow the full amount of ADB\u2019s share of eligible expenditures for the project to be disbursed as an \nimprest advance after all contracts are awarded and signed. The government will convert the loan \nadvance disbursed by ADB into baht to manage the financial risk exposures, and will keep the \nfund in an account to be established solely for the project purpose of arranging the payments \ndirectly to contractors and consultants for the project. The PDMO of the Ministry of Finance will \nbe responsible for administering the fund and making payments to the contractors and consulting \nservices for the project. The PDMO will also enter into a cross-currency interest rate swap \nagreement at the domestic swap market to hedge the financial risks for the repayment of the ADB \nLBL. The imprest fund procedure is described in detail in the PAM. \n \n24.  The introduction of this customized lending structure in the loan will be important to \ndemonstrate ADB\u2019s ability to remain a relevant and responsive development partner with UMICs. \nThis customized lending structure will also facilitate a step towards a gradual shift to the use of \nthe country\u2019s financial management system in ADB investment lending operations. This will \nimprove country ownership, build capable institutions and effective systems necessary for better \nservice delivery, and achieve sustainable development in the country. \n \n25.  The  use  of  ADB\u2019s  sovereign  local  currency  loan  product  for  this  project  has  been \nconsidered and discussed with the government. Given Thailand\u2019s well-developed domestic debt \nmarket, ADB\u2019s local currency loan is less likely to be favorable in terms of financial costs \ncompared with the government\u2019s domestic borrowing. The government opts to take the ADB LBL \nin US dollars with the abovementioned customized lending structure. The introduction of this \ncustomized lending structure in an ADB LBL project loan could be considered an innovative \napproach to support UMICs, in which the domestic debt markets are usually well developed. \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical \n \n26.  The project is technically feasible. It incorporates standard design requirements and \ncriteria of the DOH; and construction techniques used on all the government\u2019s four-lane national \nhighway projects in Thailand. All construction activities will be carried out within the existing right-\nof-way (ROW). Engineering design documents and construction drawings are standard, and no \ntechnical issues are contemplated. \n ", "7 \nB.  Economic and Financial \n \n27.  The project has an economic internal rate of return of 15.2% and a net present value of \n$152.7 million at a discount rate of 9%.16 The key measured benefits are reduced vehicle \noperating costs, reduced travel time, and reduced risk of fatal and nonfatal injury from road \naccidents, compared with the without-project case. Connecting to the Thai border facility of \nNakhon Phanom, the upgraded project road will offer a more efficient link between producers in \nThailand and consumer markets in neighboring GMS countries, and strengthen a land bridge \noption  for  accessing  ocean  shipping  routes  from  the  GMS,  enhancing  regional  economic \nintegration.  \n \n28.  The executing agency and project owner, DOH, is a general government sector unit, and \nthe project is nonrevenue generating and non-cost recovery. Hence, the financial analysis focuses \non the financial sustainability of the project. The financial analysis assesses the project executing \nagency\u2019s  financial  capacity  to  meet  the  recurrent  costs  of  operating  and  maintaining  the \ndeveloped facilities in a sustainable manner. The financial management assessment undertaken \nduring  project  preparation  assessed  the  DOH\u2019s  financial  capacity  to  maintain  the  project \nsustainably. The analysis concluded that the DOH has sufficient financial management capacity, \nwithin  the  government\u2019s  budgetary  procedures,  for  the  recurrent  expenditures  required  for \nmaintaining and operating the project in a sustainable manner. The DOH has identified the annual \nincremental recurrent costs of the project and has requested annual budget funding for covering \nthem. Given the government\u2019s strong commitment to the four-lane expansion program for national \nhighways, adequate budgetary allocation for covering  the recurrent costs of operating and \nmaintaining  the  project  is  reasonably  expected.  The  project  team  will  incorporate  specific \nassurance regarding the government provision of budgetary resources and experienced and \nqualified  staff for  project  sustainability  in  the  loan  documentation.  The  project  is  therefore \nconsidered financially sustainable.  \n \nC.  Governance \n \n29.  The project team undertook a project procurement risk assessment to assess the DOH\u2019s \ncapacity  with  regard  to  organization  and  staffing,  information  management,  procurement \npractices,  and  accountability  measures.  The  DOH  is  adequately  staffed  and  functional  for \nprocurement activities; and has good experience in the procurement of works and consulting \nservices under externally assisted projects funded by ADB, the World Bank, and the Japan \nInternational Cooperation Agency. Procurement of civil works and recruitment of consultants to \nbe financed by the loan follow ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2015, as amended from time to \ntime) and Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time). All contract \npackages are subject to prior review by ADB. The risk rating for procurement is moderate.  \n \n30.  The financial management assessment confirms that the DOH has adequate financial \nmanagement capacity and arrangements for implementing the project. The DOH has a good \nunderstanding of ADB\u2019s financial management policies and procedures, having undertaken an \nADB-financed project in the past. The financial management assessment also reveals that the \nPDMO  has  adequate  capacity  to  administer  the  ADB  loan  proceeds,  examine  withdrawal \napplications, and arrange payments to contractors and services. This is the first time the PDMO \nwill handle loan disbursements from ADB directly. ADB, through the Thailand Resident Mission, \nwill  provide  direct  support  to  the  PDMO  during  project  implementation  to  ensure  efficient \ndisbursement. ADB will conduct a workshop for the PDMO and DOH to help deepen their \n                                                \n16 Economic and Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "8 \nunderstanding  of  ADB\u2019s  loan  disbursement  process.  The  PAM  provides  the  disbursement \narrangements in detail. \n \n31.  The project team identified and assessed ADB\u2019s fiduciary risks. To ensure ADB\u2019s financial \ncontrol and continued oversight of the project resulting from the single tranche disbursement, ADB \ndevised and incorporated specific covenants and measures in the loan documents. Overall, the \nfinancial management risk is rated moderate.     \n \n32.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government, including the DOH and PDMO. The specific policy requirements and \nsupplementary measures are described in the PAM. \n \nD.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n33.  The project is categorized as having no gender elements. Nevertheless, gender and \ndevelopment activities are integrated and mainstreamed throughout the resettlement plan. The \nDOH will ensure that the principles of gender equality aimed at increasing project benefits and \nimpacts on women in the project area are followed during the implementation of the plan. These \nprinciples include (i) equal chance for women in getting hired for unskilled work and equal \nremuneration for the same work as men; (ii) inviting women to be represented in consultations \nduring implementation of the plan, and both women and men participating in the discussions; \n(iii) prioritizing women in accessing income restoration programs, which will be provided during \nthe implementation of the plan; and (iv) developing disaggregated monitoring indicators for \nmonitoring social benefits, economic opportunities, livelihood, and resettlement activities. \n \n34.  To meet the challenge of an increase in sexually transmitted infections and HIV/AIDS that \ncan be directly linked to construction-based activities, the project team included several mitigation \nmeasures in the summary poverty reduction and social strategy.17 As part of an HIV awareness \ncampaign, activities will include providing advice on access to testing and treatment for HIV and \nother sexually transmitted infections, and increasing awareness of behavior that increases risks. \nAwareness  activities  will  also  address  human trafficking,  including capacity  building  of the \nexecuting agency, awareness on safe migration, and community monitoring. The project will \nsupport measures to reinforce the negative impacts of people trafficking in local communities. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n \n35.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project\u2019s safeguard \ncategories are in paras. 36\u201340.18 \n \n36.  Environment (category B). The project is not anticipated to cause significant adverse \nenvironmental impacts as road expansion activities will be confined within the ROW of the project \nwith only minor and short-term environmental impacts during construction. The project road \nsections in National Highway  22 and National Highway 23 are not within any ecologically \nprotected area. The DOH prepared an initial environmental examination (IEE) to meet the \nrequirements  of  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  and  this  includes  an  environmental \nmanagement plan (EMP). The recommended environmental mitigation measures and monitoring \nactivities set out in the EMP cover the preconstruction, construction, and operation stages of the \nproject. The DOH has a unit for resettlement and environmental protection that is well-staffed with \n                                                \n17 Summary of Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of lined documents in Appendix 2). \n18  ADB. Safeguard Categories. https://www.adb.org/site/safeguards/safeguard-categories. \n ", "9 \nspecialists in environmental protection and has experience in ADB projects. The construction \nsupervision consultant\u2019s environmental specialists will assist DOH during project implementation. \nThe  EMP,  which  also  defines  the  institutional  arrangements  and  responsibilities  for  the \nimplementation of the plan, will be included in the bidding documents and ensuing contracts. The \ncontractors  will  be  required  to  prepare  site-specific  contractor\u2019s  EMP  before  commencing \nconstruction.  \n \n37.  The DOH conducted public consultations to inform the stakeholders about the project and \nknow their concerns so that these may be adequately addressed. The highlights of the public \nconsultations  are  in  the  IEE,  with  additional  consultations  scheduled  during  project \nimplementation. The DOH developed a grievance redress mechanism for resolving environmental \ncomplaints for the project. The DOH will prepare an updated IEE should there be major changes \nto the project design, which will include additional mitigation measures to the EMP and/or \ncontractor\u2019s EMP to address unanticipated environmental impacts that were not identified in the \noriginal IEE. The IEE and updated IEE, if any, will be disclosed on ADB\u2019s website. \n \n38.  Involuntary resettlement (category B). The project will not entail any further land \nacquisition, as the land acquisition for the ROW of the project has been completed since 1967. \nThe involuntary resettlement safeguard is mainly to mitigate and address minor impacts that will \noccur within the ROW. The detailed inventory prepared during project preparation identified \n155 households that could be affected by the project, of which 11 will be severely affected. All \nthese households are using government land unlawfully within the ROW, and all impacts are \ncharacterized as economic displacements of shop owners and paddy farmers.  \n \n39.   The project team prepared a resettlement plan in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard \nPolicy  Statement.  The  plan  will  ensure  measures  for  affected  persons  to  assist  them  in \nmaintaining if not improving on their socioeconomic pre-project conditions. Measures in the plan \ninclude (i) the gradual transfer of shops by the DOH and contractors on the residual area along \nthe road; (ii) farmers encroaching and tilling the land within the ROW will have to discontinue \nfarming activities; and (iii) linking affected households with livelihood assistance programs. The \nproject team carried out consultations with affected households during the preparation of the plan \nand the households acknowledged willingness to terminate and transfer their income-generating \nactivities when the project commences. The plan was disclosed on ADB\u2019s website on 14 June \n2017. A grievance mechanism and monitoring system have been established per Thai legal \nframework.  With  the  assistance  of  a  resettlement  specialist,  DOH  will  be  responsible  for \nimplementing the plan.  \n \n40.  Indigenous peoples (category C). No indigenous peoples are present in the area as the \nproject roads do not cross or affect any communities of indigenous peoples. \n \nF.  Summary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n \n41.  Significant risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in \ndetail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.19 The risks are assessed as manageable \nby adopting the mitigating measures. \n \n \n \n \n                                                \n19 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "10 \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigation Measures \nLack of fiduciary control of ADB\u2019s loan  Specific measures and covenants have been devised \nproceeds resulting from single tranche  and incorporated in loan documents to ensure ADB\u2019s \ndisbursement arrangement.  financial control and continued oversight. \nLess-competitive tenders submitted by  ADB, together with the construction supervision \nbidders because of possible coordination  consultant, will closely monitor the tendering process, \nbetween civil works contractors in the  including providing assistance to DOH in the analysis of \npreparation of tenders.  tenders and the preparation of comparative bid analyses \nand/ or reports. \nInadequate attention by other  The government is aware of the road safety issue and \nstakeholders, including government  supports measures to improve it. \nofficials and road users, to road safety. \nMajor turnover in key DOH staff during  The government aims to retain key staff with general staff \nimplementation.  retention policy. \nADB = Asian Development Bank, DOH = Department of Highways, PDMO = Public Debt Management Office. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \nIV.
