Investment Program Summary\nThe proposed Third Public-Private Infrastructure Development Facility (PPIDF 3) is a continuation of the work carried out under \nthe Public-Private Infrastructure Development Facility (PPIDF 1) and the Second Public-Private Infrastructure Development \nFacility (PPIDF 2) in addressing the infrastructure deficiencies in Bangladesh. Through the two earlier interventions, ADB has \nprovided long-term debt financing and catalyzing private sector participation through the implementing agency, i.e. Infrastructure\nDevelopment Company Limited (IDCOL) which substantially contributed to economic growth in the country. The design of the \nproject serves to catalyze commercial financing for public-private partnership (PPP) projects, thereby reducing the pressure of \ndirect financing on the public budget. An additional objective of the facility is to help provide the rural population and small to \nmedium enterprises with clean and affordable electricity either through grid-connected or off-grid energy efficiency and \nrenewable energy solutions. Solar home systems (SHSs) will not be financed under PPIDF 3 given the market saturation and \navailability of funding from partner donors.\nImpact: Investments in infrastructure increased (Bangladesh Seventh Five Year Plan, FY2016-FY2020) \nOutcome: Private sector investments in infrastructure, including renewable energy leveraged \nOutputs: (i)Available long-term debt financing for infrastructure projects increased, (ii)Take-out financing for infrastructure \nprojects catalyzed,  and (iii)IDCOLs institutional capacity strengthened\nImplementation Arrangements: Ministry of Finance will be the executing agency.\n \nProject Readiness: Infrastructure Development Company Limited (IDCOL) has a solid pipeline of 10 subprojects with a total \nproject cost of $2,961.9 million which require possible funding by IDCOL under tranche 1 of PPIDF 3 of about $532.3 million. All \nof these subprojects have already received initial clearance from IDCOL Board and are at advanced stages of due diligence. \nIDCOL has also an indicative list of 11 subprojects in the renewable energy and energy efficiency sectors, mostly involving solar\nenergy. They will require an investment of up to $102.0 million, of which IDCOL is expected to provide $51.5 million. Total \nIDCOL investment demand for these pipeline deals overall is therefore approximately $583.8 million, i.e. well in excess of the \n$260.0 million first PPIDF 3 tranche. \n12.

I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \nmultitranche financing facility (MFF) to the People's Republic of Bangladesh for the Third Public\u2013\nPrivate Infrastructure Development Facility. The report also describes the proposed technical \nassistance (TA) to be provided by the Financial Sector Development Partnership Special Fund \nfor Capacity Development of Infrastructure Development Company Limited (IDCOL), and if the \nBoard approves the proposed MFF, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, \napprove the administration of the TA.1 \n \nII.  THE INVESTMENT PROGRAM \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n2.  Infrastructure  investment  needed  for  accelerating  growth.  Bangladesh  recorded \nstrong, steady average annual gross domestic product (GDP) growth of 6.3% in FY2011\u2012FY2015. \nBased on its gross national income per capita of $1,080, it attained lower-middle income country \nstatus in July 2015. For Bangladesh to move toward upper middle-income status, real GDP will \nneed to grow at an average annual rate of 7.4% during the Seventh Five Year Plan, FY2016\u2013\nFY2020 (7th FYP).2 This will require a substantial increase in gross public and private investments \nfrom about 29.0% of GDP in FY2015 to 34.4% by FY2020 in order to achieve the growth target. \nOverall investment needed over the 7th FYP is estimated at Tk31.9 trillion, of which 77.3% will \nhave to come from the private sector (Table 1). Much of this investment will need to go toward \nenhancing infrastructure, improving labor skills, and boosting manufacturing production. \n \nTable 1: Government\u2019s Investment Program \nunder the Seventh Five Year Plan FY2016\u2013FY2020  \n(Tk billion) \nItem  Public  Share (%)  Private   Share (%)  Total  Share (%) \nDomestic resources  6,384.6  88.0  22,466.4  91.1  28,851.0  90.4 \nExternal resources  867.6  12.0  2,184.1  8.9  3,051.8  9.6 \nTotal investment  7,252.2  22.7  24,650.5  77.3  31,902.7  100.0 \nSource:  Government  of  Bangladesh,  Planning  Commission.  2015.

The government put considerable emphasis on the development of infrastructure during \nthe Sixth Five Year Plan, FY2011\u2013FY2015 and assigned it the highest priority in its budgets, but \npublic investment in infrastructure has not kept up with growing demand.3 The gap in infrastructure \nfinancing remains as a major challenge in the 7th FYP and is estimated at 5%\u20126% of GDP, or a \nshortfall of $9 billion\u2012$10 billion a year. This underinvestment and the wide infrastructure deficit \nare key obstacles to achieving the country\u2019s growth targets.  \n \n4.  Challenges for financing infrastructure in Bangladesh. Although other factors make it \ndifficult to attract and retain new investment\u2014a challenging business climate, slow dispute \nsettlement mechanism, and inadequate institutional capacities\u2014the inadequate supply of long-\n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  Government of Bangladesh, Planning Commission. 2015.

Sixth Five Year Plan, FY2011\u2012FY2020: Accelerating \nGrowth and Reducing Poverty. Dhaka. \n ", "2 \nterm debt financing remains a key binding constraint to closing the infrastructure gap.4 Most \ncommercial banks in Bangladesh focus on short-dated lending that goes mainly to the emerging \nconsumer finance sector. Banks have short-term retail deposits that are not suitable for funding \nlong-dated infrastructure loans, and they lack the technical ability to analyze and structure project \nfinance transactions.  \n \n5.  Policy framework, road map, and investment plan for infrastructure in Bangladesh. \nThe 7th FYP aims to accelerate economic growth and reduce poverty through steps to boost \ninfrastructure development and private sector investment. The 7th FYP which aims to promote \ninvestments across several infrastructure subsectors through comprehensive policy, regulatory, \nmarket, and financing support will serve as the policy framework for enabling public\u2013private \npartnerships  (PPPs)  to  be  supported  by  the  proposed  Third  Public\u2013Private  Infrastructure \nDevelopment Facility (PPIDF 3) of the Asian Development Bank (ADB).5 \n \n6.  With extensive support from ADB, the government issued in 2010 a PPP policy and \nstrategy to facilitate the development of core sector public infrastructure and services. The policy \nprioritizes increased investment in infrastructure and provides a framework for attracting domestic \nand  international  investors  to  partner  with  the  government  in  building  and  upgrading  core \ninfrastructure. Under this new national policy, a PPP office (now called the PPP Authority) was \nestablished  under  the  Prime  Minister\u2019s  Office  to  support  sector  line  ministries  to  facilitate \nidentification, development, tendering, and finance of PPP projects. These policy and institutional \nreform efforts culminated in the enactment of the PPP law6 in September 2015.7  \n \n7.  The medium-term macroeconomic framework of the 7th FYP represents the overall road \nmap for the investment program Indicative infrastructure requirements8 estimated in the 7th FYP \nforesee an increased demand for transport investment from 1.6% of GDP in the baseline year of \nFY2015 to a yearly average of 3% during FY2016\u2012FY2020. The infrastructure areas needing \nattention include roads, highways and bridges, railways, urban and rural transport, ports, civil \nairports,  inland  water  transport,  and  port  infrastructure.  Total  investments  to  meet  critical \nrequirements in the energy sector are projected at an average 2.5% of GDP per year, of which \nthe public sector can cover only 1.7%. Achieving visible progress in all these areas will need \nprivate  sector  investments,  including  PPP  arrangements.  The  7th  FYP  aims  to  raise  PPP \n                                                \n4  The Asian Development Bank has supported the development of the domestic bond market in Bangladesh since \n1997. Assistance focused on market stabilization and sustainable market development under ADB\u2019s first and second \ncapital market development programs. A third capital market development program approved in 2015 continued work \nunder these first two programs to support the role of the market regulator in developing and monitoring the market, \nstrengthening regulatory measures, and establishing a clearing and settlement company.  \n5 Framework Financing Agreement (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).

Mandate of Infrastructure Development Company Limited. The government has given \nIDCOL, a state-owned nonbank financial institution, the mandate to promote and finance PPP \nprojects and to thereby play a large role in mobilizing long-term debt funding for private sector \ninfrastructure investments. IDCOL is the only domestic financial institution that can catalyze \ninternational long-term foreign currency funding and has the technical capability to structure and \nexecute infrastructure and project financing.  \n \n9.  The Third Public\u2013Private Infrastructure Development Facility. PPIDF 3 is a $526.0 \nmillion MFF to the government for relending to IDCOL comprising: (i) a $500.0 million regular \nordinary capital resources (OCR) loan component, and (ii) a $26.0 million concessional OCR loan \ncomponent.10 The regular OCR loan component will be used to finance medium-sized and large \nPPP projects while the concessional OCR loan component will finance small and medium-sized \nrenewable energy and energy efficiency facilities.11 PPIDF 3 will support the government\u2019s \ninfrastructure development agenda by catalyzing private sector investments in subprojects that \ncomply with the criteria set in the framework financing agreement. PPIDF 3 is in line with ADB\u2019s \nfinancial sector operational plan, which emphasizes private sector participation in infrastructure \nfinance, and with ADB\u2019s PPP operational plan for 2012\u20132020.12 ADB\u2019s country partnership \nstrategy for Bangladesh for 2016\u20132020 stresses the need for ADB to support private sector-led \ninfrastructure development and PPPs.13 \n \n10.  Value  added  by  the  multitranche  financing  facility  modality.  PPP  infrastructure \nprojects are typically developed in a phased manner that is based on project implementation \nrequirements, and the MFF modality will allow IDCOL to onlend to eligible subprojects based on \nreadiness  criteria.  These  criteria  will  include  the  finalization  of  risk-sharing  arrangements, \nreadiness to procure equipment and other assets, and the release of equity by project sponsors \nin accordance with construction progress. As the financial intermediary under the MFF modality, \nIDCOL can be assured that funding will be available when the subprojects require financing. This \ngives IDCOL the flexibility to manage its finances and plan disbursements properly and cost-\neffectively.14  The  proposed  MFF  allows  ADB  to  further  strengthen  its  long-term  strategic \npartnership with IDCOL to better assist its operations over time. ADB\u2019s success in applying the \nMFF financial intermediary modality in several interventions in India further justifies its use in \nPPIDF 3. 15  \n                                                \n9  L.

To date, 67 PPP projects were funded under these facilities in India (ADB. 2007. Report \nand Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Multitranche Financing Facility to India \n \n ", "4 \n11.  The investment program\u2019s catalytic development role. The phased MFF and the \nassociated TA will complement the government\u2019s resource mobilization by catalyzing commercial \nfinancing through IDCOL-supported infrastructure subprojects and thereby supporting private \nsector development. PPIDF 3 aims to catalyze more than $789.0 million in private sector \ninvestments in at least eight subprojects through the regular OCR loan, and at least two renewable \nenergy  subprojects  through the  concessional OCR  loan  (Appendix  1). The  comprehensive \ninstitutional capacity development program supported by the associated TA will build on important \nachievements made under the Public\u2012Private Infrastructure Development Facility (PPIDF 1).16 \nPPIDF 3 will help IDCOL improve practices and build capabilities in such areas as subproject \nassessment, pricing and financial modeling, and risk management. \n \n12.  The investment program will contribute significantly to ADB\u2019s objective of doubling its \nannual climate financing commitment from the current level of $3 billion to $6 billion by 2020. The \nentire $26.0 million concessional OCR loan component and $100.0 million of the regular OCR \nloan component are expected to fund small and medium-sized renewable energy and energy \nefficiency subprojects using environmentally friendly technologies. This support will qualify as \nclimate change mitigation finance. \n \n13.  ADB\u2019s long-term partnership with Infrastructure Development Company Limited. \nADB has been supporting the government\u2019s infrastructure development agenda through IDCOL \nand provided two previous stand-alone facilities totaling $275.0 million under PPIDF 1 and the \nSecond Public\u2012Public Infrastructure Development Facility (PPIDF 2).17 Without ADB\u2019s support \nthrough these two interventions, IDCOL would not have been able to provide sufficient amounts \nof long-dated financing due to its limited capacity to raise funds on its own from the market. The \nADB facilities allowed IDCOL to share its due diligence knowledge with commercial domestic \nbanks since IDCOL could not finance more than 40% of a particular subproject cost from its own \nbalance sheet. PPIDF 1 was fully disbursed in 2014, well ahead of its target closing date. The \n$82.0 million regular OCR lending was used to fund three large power plant subprojects, and \nproceeds from the $83.0 million concessional OCR lending financed two subprojects in the \ninformation technology sector and 330,362 solar home systems (SHSs). PPIDF catalyzed $491.0 \nmillion and supported the addition of 551 megawatts of electricity, or about 5% of the national \ngeneration capacity as of 2014. \n \n14.  As of 1 February 2017, IDCOL had disbursed $70.0 million from the $100.0 million PPIDF \n2 OCR loan to three power plants and one inland river container terminal. Of the $10.0 million \nAsian Development Fund loan, $7.1 million had been disbursed to finance SHSs as part of one \nof the largest and most successful off-grid renewable energy programs in the world. IDCOL has \ncommitted the remaining OCR loan funds to one more subproject. It expects disbursements to \n                                                \nfor the India Infrastructure Project Financing Facility. Manila; ADB. 2009.

Lessons  learned  and  experience  gained  through  early  interventions.  PPIDF  3 \nincorporates lessons ADB has learned from implementing earlier financial intermediation loan \nprograms for infrastructure, particularly PPIDF 1 and PPIDF 2. First, IDCOL has developed in-\ndepth expertise in appraising subprojects in the power and renewable energy sector, allowing the \ncompany to leverage more resources and expand its infrastructure business portfolio, and to \nsustain a tested business model that has resulted in a robust pipeline of projects. Second, though \nIDCOL\u2019s SHS program is considered as one of the most successful and largest renewable energy \nprograms in the world, it is now starting to show signs of market saturation, affecting IDCOL\u2019s \nasset quality.18 IDCOL is taking proactive measures to improve its SHS\u2019 collection efficiency. \nPPIDF 3 provides corrective measures and substantive capacity building for IDCOL to improve \nits debt recovery and restructuring plan, and strengthen its risk management and internal control. \nMoreover, no SHS will be funded under PPIDF 3. The SHS experience under the two previous \ninvestment programs underscores the importance to IDCOL\u2019s successful loan operations of \nensuring portfolio diversification and avoiding revenue concentration from a single program or \ntechnology. PPIDF 3 incorporates not only the provision of financing to promote PPPs but also \nthe value added in providing institutional reforms and introducing an innovative product, i.e. take-\nout  financing  to  support  the  development  and  deepening  of  the  domestic  debt  market  in \nBangladesh.  \n \n16.  Introduction of risk-based pricing and take-out financing. While IDCOL has provided \nfunding as part of a lending consortium and has followed the credit terms agreed on by other \nconsortium members in most of its interventions, its risk profile and appetite is different from that \nof commercial banks\u2014given its unique status as a fully government-owned finance company with \nno branch network to mobilize low-cost retail customer deposits. IDCOL will use its resources to \nprice its loans in a way that would reflect its ownership status and funding cost by developing its \nown internal pricing model with support from the associated TA.19 IDCOL will explore the scope \nto access the domestic and\u2014at a later phase\u2014the offshore bond markets, either through an \ninternational bond issue\u2014partially guaranteed by ADB\u2014or through an offshore taka linker bond. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n17.  The impact will be increased investments in infrastructure, including renewable energy \nand energy efficiency facilities, aligned with Bangladesh\u2019s Seventh Five Year Plan, FY2016\u2013\nFY2020 (footnote 2). The outcome will be leveraged private sector investments in infrastructure, \nincluding the financing of renewable energy and energy efficiency facilities. \n  \nC.  Outputs \n \n18.  The  outputs  will  be  (i)  available  long-term  debt  financing  for  infrastructure  projects \n                                                \n18 N. Bertsch and P. Marro. 2015.

This ensures that projects get long-term funding from \nvarious participants. Take-out financing will enable banks to participate over the short term in financing infrastructure \nprojects without creating adverse asset\u2013liability mismatches in tenors even though their liabilities are mostly short-\nterm deposits. \n ", "6 \nincreased, (ii) take-out financing for infrastructure projects catalyzed, and (iii) IDCOL\u2019s institutional \ncapacity strengthened. \n \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans \n \n19.  The government\u2019s investment program under the 7th FYP amounts to Tk31.9 trillion (Table \n1). ADB\u2019s PPIDF 3 investment program will contribute $1,315.0 million comprising $500.0 million \nin regular OCR loans, $26.0 million in concessional OCR loans, equity of $263.0 million from \nproject sponsors, and commercial debt financing of $526.0 million to help finance infrastructure, \nand renewable energy and energy efficiency subprojects (Table 2). \n \nTable 2: Financing Plan \n  Amount  Share of  Tranche 1  Tranche 2 \nSource  ($ million)  Total (%)  ($ million)  ($ million) \nAsian Development Bank         \n     Ordinary capital resources (regular loans)  500.0  38.0  250.0  250.0 \n     Ordinary capital resources (concessional loans)   26.0  2.0  10.0  16.0 \nEquity (assuming 20% of subprojects\u2019 costs)  263.0  20.0  130.0  133.0 \nCommercial banks and/or financiers (debt)a  526.0  40.0  260.0  266.0 \nTotal  1,315.0  100.0  650.0  665.0 \nADB = Asian Development Bank. \na This assumes that the sponsor will provide equity financing of 20% of total subproject cost, that commercial banks \nand financiers will provide debt funding of 40% of total subproject cost, and that Infrastructure Development Company \nLimited will finance 40% of each subproject using ADB funds provided under the Third Public\u2013Private Infrastructure \nDevelopment Facility. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n20.  The MFF is expected to be disbursed in two tranches\u2014tranche 1, covering 2017\u20132020 \nand comprising a $250.0 million regular OCR loan and a SDR7,229,000 concessional OCR loan; \nand tranche 2, covering 2020\u20132023, subject to the government\u2019s submission of related periodic \nfinancing requests, execution of the related loan and project agreements for each tranche, and \nthe fulfilment of terms and conditions and undertakings set forth in the framework financing \nagreement. For tranche 1, the regular OCR loan will have a 20-year term, including a grace period \nof 5 years, an annual interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered \nrate-based lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.15% per annum, and such others terms and \nconditions set forth in the draft loan and project agreements. The concessional OCR loan will \nhave a 25-year term, including a grace period of 5 years, an interest rate of 2.0% per annum \nduring the grace period and thereafter, and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft \nloan and project agreements. The government will relend the proceeds from the regular OCR loan \nto IDCOL either (i) in US dollars at the London interbank offered rate plus 100 basis points per \nannum20 for a 20-year term, with a grace period of 5 years; or (ii) in taka at the Bangladesh Bank \nrate21 for a 20-year term, with a grace period of 5 years, pursuant to a subsidiary loan agreement. \nIn the latter case, the government will bear the foreign exchange risks. IDCOL will use the regular \nOCR loan proceeds to provide medium and long-term subloans in local currency or US dollars for \nmedium-sized and large infrastructure subprojects that have total costs that exceed $10.0 million. \nThese will include renewable energy and energy efficiency subprojects. The onlending by IDCOL \nto private sector subprojects will be at interest rates that reflect IDCOL\u2019s cost of funds plus a \nspread to cover transactional costs and risks to be determined by IDCOL based on commercial \nand competitive terms.  \n \n                                                \n20 These are the unchanged onlending terms for US dollar funds under PPIDF 2. \n21 These are the unchanged onlending terms for taka funds under PPIDF 2. \n ", "7 \n21.  The government will make the concessional OCR loan proceeds available to IDCOL in \ntaka at a rate of 3% per annum pursuant to a subsidiary loan agreement. The government will \nbear the foreign exchange risk. IDCOL will use the proceeds from the concessional OCR loan to \nprovide medium- and long-term subloans in local currency to renewable energy and energy \nefficiency subprojects that have a total cost not exceeding $10.0 million at interest rates that allow \nIDCOL to earn a risk-adjusted return. Subprojects in the following renewable energy and energy \nefficiency  sectors  will  be  financed:  (i)  grid-connected  solar  projects,  solar  mini-grids,  solar \nirrigation pumps, wind, and other renewable energy installations; (ii) energy-efficient projects, \nincluding brick kilns, waste, and effluent treatment plants; (iii) recycling plants; (iv) waste-to-\nenergy solutions; and (v) biogas and biomass-based power plants. \n \n22.  Demand analysis. IDCOL has 10 indicative subprojects with a total project cost of \n$2,961.9 million in its pipeline for possible funding under tranche 1 of PPIDF 3. These would \nrequire investments of about $532.3 million by IDCOL and have all received initial clearance from \nIDCOL\u2019s Board. IDCOL has an indicative pipeline of 11 subprojects in the renewable energy and \nenergy efficiency sectors, mostly involving solar energy. They will require an investment of up to \n$102.0 million, of which IDCOL is expected to provide $51.5 million. Total IDCOL investment \ndemand for these pipeline deals overall is about $583.8 million\u2014i.e., well in excess of the $260.0 \nmillion first PPIDF 3 tranche. \n \n23.  Coordination with development partners. In preparing the investment program, ADB \nhas coordinated with development partners to avoid duplication of resources and explore possible \ncofinancing, including continued support to strengthen IDCOL\u2019s institutional capacity in areas \nsuch as safeguards and financial management. While other development partners have ongoing \nlines of credit with IDCOL or are in discussions for possible lending,22 ADB remains as the leading \ndevelopment partner supporting IDCOL\u2019s infrastructure finance business.23 \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n24.  The Ministry of Finance, acting through its Economic Relations Division, will be the \nexecuting agency. The ministry\u2019s Finance Division will be the financial management agency, and \nIDCOL will be the implementing agency. IDCOL\u2019s board of directors will provide policy direction \nand strategic oversight. The project management unit established at IDCOL under PPIDF 1, will \n(i) monitor the implementation of the investment program and ADB-financed subloans; (ii) build \nIDCOL\u2019s capabilities for monitoring exposure limits, improving its processes, and assessing and \nanalyzing  risk;  and  (iii)  ensure  compliance  with  state  and  national  policies  and  IDCOL's \nenvironmental and social safeguard framework (ESSF). The ESSF in turn will ensure compliance \nwith ADB safeguard policies and national norms. \n \n25.  Retroactive financing. Retroactive financing will be allowed for eligible expenditures not \nexceeding 20.0% of each tranche loan amount, incurred before loan effectiveness but not earlier \nthan 12 months before signing of the tranche\u2019s loan agreements. Any retroactive financing must \ncomply with the same ADB requirements as for any other subprojects funded under PPIDF 3. \n \n26.  Take-out financing. IDCOL may use up to 20% of the ADB loans to refinance eligible \ninfrastructure loans from banks and other financial institutions. Take-out financing can include \n                                                \n22 Development Coordination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n23 The World Bank is the primary funder of IDCOL\u2019s SHS program, and the Japan International Cooperation Agency \nsigned a loan agreement in 2016 with IDCOL and Bangladesh Infrastructure Finance Fund Limited for a $100 million \nenergy efficiency program. \n ", "8 \nsubprojects  that  are  financially  closed,  under  construction,  or  fully  commissioned  following \nIDCOL\u2019s internal guidelines and Bangladesh Bank norms, and comply with the same ADB \nrequirements as any other subprojects funded under PPIDF 3.  \n \n27.  Maximum subloan size and ADB prior approval. IDCOL shall ensure that the maximum \namount of each subloan to a subproject does not exceed 40% of the total project costs, except \nthat with prior approval of ADB, the subloan may exceed the limit and be up to 60% of the project \ncost.24 Under tranche 1, ADB will review the first three subprojects funded by the regular OCR \nloan and subloans above $5.0 million equivalent funded by the concessional OCR loan to \nascertain IDCOL\u2019s ability to manage the subproject review and disbursement process. ADB \nreserves the right to request any supporting subproject documents and not to reimburse or \nliquidate any subprojects that do not comply with the PPIDF 3 implementation requirements \ndetailed in the facility administration manual (FAM).  \n \n28.  Subproject and subborrower selection criteria and approval procedures. Detailed \ninformation about the definitions, eligibility criteria, appraisal, and monitoring and lending terms \nfor subprojects can be found in the FAM.25 IDCOL will follow the same, well-established subproject \nappraisal process it did under PPIDF 1 and PPIDF 2 for determining the technical, economic, and \ncommercial viability of each subproject.26 In addition, subborrowers will be required to meet ADB \nrequirements  and  follow  the  subproject  approval  procedure  details  stipulated  in  the  loan \nagreement, the framework financing agreement, and the FAM. \n \n29.  The implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 3 and described in detail in \nthe FAM. \n \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nImplementation period  1 July 2017\u201331 December 2023 \nEstimated completion date  31 December 2023 \nManagement \n(i)  Oversight body  Nonea \n(ii)  Executing agency  Ministry of Finance (Economic Relations Division) \n(iii)  Financial management agency  Ministry of Finance (Finance Division) \n(iv)  Key implementing agency  Infrastructure Development Company Limited (IDCOL) \n(v)  Implementation unit  IDCOL project management unit \nProcurement  In accordance with established private sector or commercial \npractices, following the core principles of the ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Guidelines (2015, as amended from time to \ntime), and in a manner acceptable to ADB. \nConsulting services  In accordance with established private sector or commercial \npractices, following the core principles of ADB\u2019s Guidelines \non the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to \ntime), and in a manner acceptable to ADB. \nRetroactive financing and/or advance  Retroactive financing is permitted up to 20% of each tranche \n                                                \n24 Subprojects in the renewable energy and energy efficiency subsectors have a high developmental impact and long-\nterm funds are not easily available. Therefore, for renewable energy and energy efficiency subprojects to be funded \nout of the concessional OCR  loan, IDCOL\u2019s maximum exposure will be set at 70% (renewable energy) and 80% \nenergy efficiency).  \n25 Facility Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n26 IDCOL\u2019s lending policy allows it to finance only commercially viable projects, to provide financing on commercial \nterms, and to price loans accordingly. This means that all aspects of a subproject\u2019s economics and a subborrowers\u2019 \ncreditworthiness will be subject to extensive due diligence prior to an IDCOL loan approval.  \n ", "9 \nAspects  Arrangements \ncontracting  loan amount.  \nDisbursement  The loan proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with \nADB's Loan Disbursement Handbook (2015, as amended \nfrom time to time) and detailed arrangements agreed \nbetween IDCOL and ADB. \nADB = Asian Development Bank. \na An oversight body is considered unnecessary because IDCOL operates on an autonomous basis and is governed by \nits board of directors. The secretary of the Economic Relations Division of the Ministry of Finance serves as the IDCOL \nboard chairperson. \nSources: Asian Development Bank and Infrastructure Development Company Limited. \n \nIII.  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \n30.  The associated capacity development TA will help IDCOL improve its institutional capacity \nand adopt a long-term operational strategy based on commercial principles  to become an \neffective, commercially oriented organization. IDCOL can execute its current level of operations \nadequately but is not equipped to cope with additional financing activities and a large number of \ncomplex infrastructure subprojects. The TA will enhance IDCOL\u2019s capacity for risk management, \nsubproject  assessment,  pricing,  treasury  operations,  and  environmental  and  social  impact \nassessments. \n \n31.  The TA is estimated to cost $800,000, of which $750,000 will be financed on a grant basis \nby the Financial Sector Development Partnership Special Fund.27 IDCOL will provide counterpart \nsupport in the form of counterpart staff, office space, training and workshop venues for the TA \nactivities, and other in-kind contributions. IDCOL will also cover any further funding requirements \nthat might arise during the implementation of the TA.  \n \nIV.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Economic and Financial \n \n32.  Capital adequacy, asset and management quality, earnings, liquidity, and sensitivity to \nmarket risk are important criteria for determining the suitability of a financial intermediary\u2019s \nperformance.28 Based on ADB due diligence29 and an analysis of IDCOL\u2019s performance, IDCOL \nmeets the above financial indicators and its deal pipeline, and the capital resources of the \ncompany  are  adequate  to  support the facility.30 While  subprojects  in  various  infrastructure \nsubsectors are eligible for financing under PPIDF 3, most subprojects identified for the facility are \nin the energy and transport sectors under key government priorities. An analysis of the economic \nviability of a sample selection of energy and road projects in Bangladesh financed by ADB during \n2000\u20122015 (some of them in partnership with IDCOL) indicated satisfactory economic internal \nrates of return of 13%\u201343%.31 \n \nB.  Governance \n \n33.  Financial management. IDCOL has the capacity and knowledge to properly appraise \n                                                \n27 Established by ADB.

Procurement and disbursement. There will be no procurement directly financed under \nthe facility since procurement will be undertaken by the subproject sponsors in accordance with \nthe procedures established by private sector or commercial practices acceptable to ADB and \nmust align with the core principles of ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2015, as amended from \ntime to time).  \n \n35.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government and IDCOL. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures \nare described in the FAM. \n \nC.  Poverty and Social \n \n36.  Infrastructure development supports inclusive growth and helps reduce poverty. The \ninvestment program is expected to help develop high-quality infrastructure facilities that will \nstimulate productivity increases and in turn increase employment and income opportunities and \nhelp reduce poverty. The poor in Bangladesh are acutely affected by a lack of access to basic \ninfrastructure and services, which restricts their ability to diversify and improve their livelihoods. \nSuch economic impacts of the infrastructure deficit as unreliable intermittent power supply \nparticularly affect the many people who depend on small enterprises in the informal sector to earn \na living.  \n \n37.  Gender  and  social  dimensions.  IDCOL,  through  its  environmental  and  social \nmanagement unit, will ensure that all subborrowers are informed of the commitment of the \ngovernment and its agencies to promote gender equality and women's empowerment through its \npolicies, laws, and regulations. IDCOL will disseminate to its subborrowers (i) the government\u2019s \nNational Women Development Policy (2011), which has been reflected in the 7th FYP; and (ii) a \ncircular issued by the Bangladesh Bank\u2019s Department of Financial Institutions and Markets on \nmainstreaming corporate social responsibility, which requires financial institutions to report on a \nsemi-annual basis on gender equality-related performance indicators. \n \nD.  Safeguards \n \n38.  PPIDF  3  is  classified  category  FI  for  environment,  involuntary  resettlement,  and \nindigenous peoples. No subproject that is classified category A in any of these three safeguard \nareas will be considered for financing under the investment program. All subloan agreements will \nincorporate specific covenants to ensure compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement \n(2009).  \n \n39.  IDCOL has an ESSF developed in 2011 with ADB technical support under PPIDF. 32 A \nreview in August 2016 to ensure that the ESSF remained consistent with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy \nStatement identified areas for strengthening. The associated TA will therefore help IDCOL \n                                                \n32  IDCOL.  2011.

Depending on the \ncomplexity of subprojects, IDCOL may hire an additional senior staff member to deal with social \nand  gender  issues.  IDCOL  will  submit  annual  reports  to  ADB  on  the  status  of  ESSF \nimplementation.34 \n \nE.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \n40.  Capacity for structuring large infrastructure projects. Potential key risks are mostly \nrelated to Bangladesh\u2019s limited experience in structuring large infrastructure subprojects, which \ncould lead to inadequate design and pricing of subprojects. This risk will be mitigated by the fact \nthat PPIDF 3 builds on the experience gained with IDCOL under PPIDF 1 and PPIDF 2 and on \nsynergies with the ongoing PPP program of the government, which provides capacity building for \nenhanced development and structuring of infrastructure subprojects. Overall, the integrated \nbenefits and impacts of PPIDF 3 are expected to outweigh the costs. \n \n41.  Pressure on Infrastructure Development Company Limited\u2019s balance sheet. The \nquality of IDCOL\u2019s asset portfolio has shown deterioration during 2013\u20122016 due to a growing \nvolume of rescheduled loans from its weakly performing SHS program. Out of 56 loans to \nparticipating organizations under the SHS program, IDCOL has rescheduled loans to two of its \nparticipating organizations amounting to Tk3,824 million and 9.0% of all loans to its participating \norganizations are classified loans in the substandard category.35 The classification of participating \norganizations\u2019 loans has dampened IDCOL\u2019s overall profitability, which was Tk2,656 million \n($33.9 million) in 2015. Details on IDCOL\u2019s financial performance are in the financial analysis.36 \n \n42.  Mitigating measures. IDCOL has taken steps to mitigate these balance sheet risks. It is \npursuing defaulting debtors through legal proceedings,  increasing its debt recovery efforts, \npreparing  detailed  plans  for  restructuring  defaulting  loans,  and  implementing  a  collection \nefficiency improvement program for its SHS program. The associated TA will help intensify these \nefforts by helping IDCOL strengthen its internal control and risk management process and put \nsound financial management practices into place. Risks and mitigating measures are described \nin detail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.37 \n \nV.  ASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n \n43.  The government and IDCOL have assured ADB that implementation of the facility shall \nconform to all applicable ADB policies, including those concerning anticorruption measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the FAM and loan documents. \n                                                \n33  Bangladesh Bank. 2015.

The government and IDCOL have given ADB certain undertakings for the MFF, which are \nset forth in the framework financing agreement. Specific covenants agreed by the government \nand IDCOL with respect to individual tranches under the MFF are set forth in the loan agreement \nfor the respective tranches. As a condition to the loan effectiveness of the first tranche, the \ngovernment has assured ADB that IDCOL will appoint (i) a senior manager with a background in \nrisk management as the head of risk management and a voting member on IDCOL\u2019s credit risk \nmanagement committee; (ii) a unit head to manage IDCOL\u2019s newly established recovery unit and \nto report to the credit management head; (iii) an internal auditor at the senior level to head \nIDCOL\u2019s internal audit unit, reporting directly to the IDCOL board; and (iv) a senior officer for \nIDCOL\u2019s large infrastructure unit.  \n \nVI.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n45.
