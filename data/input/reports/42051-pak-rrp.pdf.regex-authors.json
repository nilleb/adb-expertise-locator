It will establish a dynamic business environment for clean energy \n  technology  and  finance  priority  projects.  It  constitutes  tangible  actions \ntoward a sustainable low-carbon growth path, and it has a number of \nimportant features:  \n \nMainstreaming Energy Efficiency. The Investment Program underpins a \nreform  strategy  that  will  mainstream  energy  efficiency  into  national \nplanning and public investments, and is a critical component of Pakistan's \nclimate change program. The Government of Pakistan (the Government) is \nadopting a holistic platform for strategic planning of the energy sector and \nclimate change. The Investment Program builds on ongoing work of the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) to establish integrated energy planning. It \nbacks  change  management  and  strengthens  the  capacity  of  key \nparticipants,  particularly  in  policy  planning,  gender  mainstreaming, \ninvestment, and monitoring and evaluation.  \n \nClean  Energy  Market  Transformation.  The  Investment  Program  will \nbreak down the financial barriers to clean energy investments, and finance \ndeployment of clean technology that has been successfully demonstrated. \nIt will strengthen regulatory and institutional frameworks, establish fiscal \nand financial incentives, and enforce standards and testing. \n \nPrivate Sector Engagement. The private sector will play a key role in the \ndeployment of clean technology and energy services. It will also be a direct \nbeneficiary  (on  the  supply  and  demand  sides).  Sustainable  business \nmodels for energy efficiency services (i.e., energy audits, performance \ncontracts) will be established and replicated. The Investment Program will \nincrease industrial productivity and competitiveness by lowering operating \ncosts.   \n \nPartnerships. The Investment Program sets out a framework for effective \npartnership with third parties\u2014investors and financiers\u2014over the medium ", "ii   \nterm. In addition to ADB, Agence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement (AFD) is \nthe first of these partners. Over time, other development partners may \ndetermine to complement ADB's financing after the Board's approval of the \nproposed  MFF  through  cofinancing  to  be  administered  by  ADB.  The \nInvestment Program design is directly linked with the ongoing work by \nother partners. German development cooperation through GTZ has been \nimplementing  industrial  energy  audits  and  appliance  labeling  and \ncertification projects in support of the Investment Program. The Japan \nInternational  Cooperation  Agency  is  now  developing  a  climate  change \npolicy program. The United States Agency for International Development \n(USAID) is implementing a capacity development program to strengthen \nenergy  demand-side  management  among  the  utilities  and  private \ncompanies, and is focusing on women's roles in energy. The World Bank \nis  implementing  utility-based  demand-side  management  demonstration \nprojects. The Government is discussing scaling up of such investment and \ntechnical assistance activities with GTZ, USAID, and the World Bank. \n   \nRationale  The energy gap is now one of Pakistan\u2019s most serious binding constraints \nto growth and jobs. It results from the rapid increase in demand and high \nwastage of energy, and is one of the main causes of the current economic \ncrisis. Pakistan\u2019s dependency on oil imports results from the suboptimal \nenergy supply mix that is a consequence of poor planning. The economy is \nsusceptible to fuel price volatility. \n \nPakistan  uses  15%  more  energy  than  India  and  25%  more  than  the \nPhilippines (for each dollar of gross domestic product). Energy wastage is \na high cost to the economy, businesses, and consumers; its reduction \nrequires  major  and  immediate  shifts  in  policies,  investment,  and \nconsumption patterns.  \n \nIn 2009, the power deficit reached 5,000 megawatts (MW), and natural gas \nsupply  to  industries  was  cut  during  the  4  winter  months.  People  and \nbusinesses in many parts of Pakistan are experiencing power outages and \nrationing lasting more than 12 hours a day. Factory closures are causing \nsocial unrest.  \n \nEnergy  efficiency  represents  the  least-cost  and  quickest  low-carbon \nsolution to bridge the energy gap. It cuts the high dependence on oil \nimports and avoids investment in expensive and inefficient rental power \ngeneration based on fossil fuels. It ultimately strengthens energy security, \ncontributes  to  the  environment,  creates  jobs,  and  improves  industrial \ncompetitiveness.  Energy  efficiency  is  now  a  strategic  priority  for  the \nGovernment. \n \nPakistan\u2019s total energy savings potential, through the application of clean \nand efficient technology, is estimated at 11.16 million tons of oil equivalent \n(493,304 terajoules [TJ]), or 18% of primary energy use (FY2008). This \ncorresponds to a 51% reduction in net oil imports. In FY2008, the oil import \nbill  was  $12 billion.  Savings  in  electricity  and  gas  resulting  from  well \nthought  out  energy  efficiency  investments  correspond  to  additional \ngeneration capacity of about 6,770 MW. \n ", "  iii\nEnergy  efficiency  investments  can  be  most  effective  when  the  policy, \nregulatory, and pricing regime is right. Energy tariffs have historically been \nlow in Pakistan. As such, customers have not had much of an incentive to \ninvest  in  efficient  technology,  nor  shift  consumption  patterns.  While \nelectricity production costs tripled from FY2003 to FY2007, tariffs were not \nadjusted to cover this increase. Since FY2007, tariffs increased by an \naverage of 20% and will continue doing so until reaching cost-recovery by \nFY2011. As tariffs increase, so does awareness of energy efficiency and \nincentives to acquire new, less energy-consuming technology. \n   \nMultitranche  The Government asked the Asian Development Bank for a flexible public \nFinancing Facility  sector financing mechanism to support energy efficiency in the short to \nmedium term. A multitranche financing facility (MFF) is considered the \nmost appropriate modality for energy efficiency investments in Pakistan. \nThe Government has fully met the preconditions for use of an MFF. \n \nRoad Map. The Government has adopted a clear and sound strategic \nmultisector  road  map  for  energy  efficiency  based  on  extensive \nconsultations  and  inputs  from  all  stakeholders.  An  MFF  will  provide  a \nmechanism  to  overcome  financial  barriers  to  realizing  the  road  map \ntargets.  \n \nStrategic Context. Energy security is the primary goal under Pakistan\u2019s \nenergy  strategy.  ADB\u2019s  country  partnership  strategy  for  Pakistan  has \nenergy efficiency as a core intervention area. The Investment Program is a \ncontinuation of a 10-year policy dialogue. The projected investments are \nconsistent and closely linked to ongoing ADB interventions\u2014renewable \nenergy, power generation (mostly private sector in nature), transmission, \nand distribution. These operations also fit with the latest negotiations with \nthe Government on policy reforms for sustainable and financially viable \npower sector.  \n \nPolicy Framework. The Government has a policy framework for energy \nefficiency  that  focuses  on  maximizing  energy  savings  by  rational  and \nefficient use in all energy-consuming sectors. An integrated institutional \nand resource allocation structure is required for its implementation. The \nInvestment Program projects will provide advisory and financial support to \nkey  stakeholders  in  strengthening  integrated  sector  planning  and \nmanagement. \n \nSafeguards.  The  Investment  Program  includes  a  comprehensive \nenvironmental  assessment  and  review  framework,  appropriate \nenvironmental due diligence and plans will be prepared for each project. \nThe Investment Program will not involve any involuntary resettlement or \nany issues regarding indigenous peoples. \n \nUndertakings.  The  Government  has  agreed  to  a  set  of  commitments \naimed to (i) establish a dynamic business environment for the sustained \ntransformation  of  the  energy  efficiency  market,  and  (ii) scale  up \ndeployment  of  proven  technologies  through  public  investments  and \nfostering private investment. The MFF allows consistent engagement with \n ", "iv   \nthe  Government  in  monitoring  the  progress  of  the  commitments,  and \nwhere needed, provides advisory support to achieve the targets. \n \nInvestment  and  Financing  Plan.  There  is  a  comprehensive  10-year \ninvestment  program  ($3.8  billion)  comprising  a  variety  of  sequenced \nsupply- and demand-side investments in priority sectors and institutional \ndevelopment (i.e., capacity building, governance, gender, safeguards, and \nproject preparation and implementation). An indicative financing plan is \ndefined.  The  MFF  will  finance  a  slice  of  this  investment  program  by \nfinancing  short-  to  medium-term  priority  energy  efficiency  projects  and \nsupporting institutional effectiveness, program management, and capacity \ndevelopment.  AFD  is  cofinancing  the  Investment  Program.  Third-party \ncofinancing will be structured for future MFF tranches.  \n \nEnergy Efficiency Investment Requirement, 2009\u20132018 \n($ million) \nFocus Area  Amount\nDomestic  370 \nIndustrial and Commercial  1,908 \nPower Generation  1,372 \nTransmission and Distribution  130 \n  Total   3,780 \nSources: Asian Development Bank and Planning Commission estimates. \n \nIndicative Financing Plan, 2009\u20132018 \n($ million) \nSource  Amount \nGovernment of Pakistan  600 \nOfficial External   \n  Asian Development Bank  780 \n  Agence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppementa 200 \n  United States Agency for International Developmentb  30 \n  Others  320 \nCommercial Domestic  900 \nCommercial External  950 \nTotal  3,780 \na \u20ac150 million equivalent. \nb Additional financing is being planned. \n  Sources: Asian Development Bank and Planning Commission estimates. \n   \nImpact and  The Investment Program will bring about energy savings and support low-\nOutcome  carbon growth by cutting greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 30%. It will \nimprove energy security; increase industrial productivity, profitability, and \ncompetitiveness; and decrease the family energy bill. It will contribute to \neconomic stability by decreasing the high dependence on oil imports and \ndefer large investments on generation. \n   \nFramework  The  Government  and  ADB  have  entered  a  Framework  Financing \nFinancing  Agreement  (FFA).  The  FFA  records  the  full  set  of  warranties  and \nAgreement   representations  on  safeguards,  governance,  anticorruption,  financial \n ", "  v\nmanagement, procurement, disbursement, and project selection criteria. It \nalso covers policy and investment criteria. \n   \nInvestment and  Total cost of the Investment Program is expected to be $1,180 million \nFinancing Plan  equivalent.  As  set  in  the  FFA,  the  MFF  will  finance  projects  and \nsubprojects in the priority areas identified in the table below. \n             \nMultitranche Financing Facility Investment and Financing Plan  \n($ million) \nPriority Areas  Amount  Gov\u2019t  ADB  AFD a\nA1.

This  financing  will  be \nchanneled through an MFF. The Government signed an FFA with ADB for \nup to $780 million equivalent and a similar agreement will be signed with \nAFD for up to \u20ac150 million equivalent. Funding will be requested through \nperiodic financing requests (PFRs) and extended through individual loans \nand/or guarantees.  \n \nADB will provide up to $760,000,000 equivalent from its ordinary capital \nresources  under  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based \nlending facility. At the request of the Government and if ADB considers \nappropriate,  the  aforesaid  amount  may  be  converted  into  guarantees, \ncofinancing administered by ADB, and other instruments in accordance \nwith ADB's then prevailing polices, rules and procedures. ADB will also \nprovide $20,000,000 equivalent from its Special Funds resources. \n   \nCofinancing  AFD will provide up to \u20ac150,000,000 on a joint cofinancing basis through \nloans  to  the  Government.  ADB  and  AFD  will  enter  into  a  cofinancing \nagreement for each PFR. AFD cofinancing under the Investment Program \nwill  be  handled  by  ADB  on  a  partial-administration  basis.  Cofinancing \narrangements may also be agreed with other development partners after \nthe Board's approval of the proposed MFF for future tranches under the \nInvestment Program. The amounts of cofinancing to be provided by such \nother development partners and administered by ADB will be deducted \nfrom the total MFF amount proposed. Such cofinancing may be provided \n ", "vi   \nas loans or grants, and may take the form of parallel or joint cofinancing. \nADB's administration of such cofinancing from time to time will be reported \nto the Board for information annually. \n \nSpecific projects under the Investment Program may be eligible for carbon \nfinancing  under  the  Clean  Development  Mechanism  (CDM).  ADB  will \nprovide required technical support for project entities to prepare the CDM \nproposal, and ADB's Asia Pacific Carbon Fund and Future Carbon Fund \ncould provide financing and purchase the certified emission reductions \nfrom the projects. \n   \nTranche 1  The MFF will be provided in tranches to finance projects and investment \n  program management.  \n   \n   The first PFR will be financed from tranche 1 of the MFF. It includes \nfinancing  for  the  National  Compact  Fluorescent  Lamp  (CFL)  Project \n($85 million) and the Investment Program Management Support Project \n($25  million),  which  is  essential  to  improve  institutional  effectiveness, \ncapacity, governance, gender mainstreaming, and project management \nactivities). This PFR has requested $60 million equivalent loans from ADB \nand a \u20ac20 million loan from AFD. The Government will provide $25 million \nequivalent. \n   \nAllocation and  The  Government  through  its  Economic  Coordination  Committee  is \nRelending Terms  expected  to  adopt  an  onlending  policy  specific  to  energy  efficiency \ninvestments  made  under  the  MFF.  The  policy  aims  to  leverage  MFF \nfinancing  and  encourage  commercial  borrowing  for  clean  technology \nfinancing. ADB and the Government will determine the specific terms for \neach PFR.  \n \nThe Government will use the ADB and AFD loan proceeds to finance the \nCFL project and repay through the budget. This is standard practice for \nsimilar projects in developing member countries. \n   \nPeriod of  Until 16 September 2019  \nUtilization \n   \nImplementation  The Planning Commission of Pakistan will be the Executing Agency for the \nArrangements  Investment Program. A dedicated project management office (PMO) will \nbe  established  to  help  with  the  work  and  implement  the  Investment \nProgram Management Support Project (under tranche 1). The Planning \nCommission will submit PFRs to ADB and AFD.  \n \nInvestment projects under the tranches will be prepared and managed by \ndifferent  entities  and/or  utilities,  whenever  appropriate  with  help  from \nadvisors engaged under the PMO. ADB will conduct its own independent \ndue diligence on all proposed projects to be financed under the Investment \nProgram to ensure they comply with the terms and conditions of the FFA. \n \nThe Ministry of Water and Power will be the Executing Agency for the CFL \nproject (under tranche 1). Power distribution utilities will implement this \n ", "  vii\nprogram in their respective geographic areas. The Government will cause \nthe  utilities  to  finance  the  CFL  distribution  costs  from  its  internally \ngenerated resources.  \n   \nAdvance  The  Government  requested  ADB's  approval  for  advance  actions  on \nContracting and  procurement and consulting services, and retroactive financing of up to \nRetroactive  20% of the loan amount under each tranche. \nFinancing \n   \nProcurement and  Procurement of goods and services will be implemented in accordance \nConsulting  with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). \nServices  A procurement plan will be a prerequisite for each tranche. As appropriate, \nthe turnkey contracts will be utilized and incorporated into the procurement \nplans. National competitive bidding and other methods may be used in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s guidelines. \n \nConsultants  will  be  selected  and  engaged  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to \ntime). \n   \nBenefits and  All energy consumers in Pakistan will directly benefit from the Investment \nBeneficiaries  Program.  Large  economic,  social,  and  environmental  benefits  are \nexpected as a result of energy savings from the application of clean and \nadvanced technology and practice. For example:  \n \n(i)  601,671 tons of oil equivalent /25,191 TJ (valued at $200 million) \nenergy will be saved annually from reducing transformation losses in \nthe power generation and gas transmission;  \n(ii)  918,942 tons of oil equivalent /38,474 TJ (valued at $330 million) \nenergy will be saved annually from reducing gas, oil, and coal use in \nthe domestic and industry sectors; and  \n(iii)  GHG emissions will be cut by about 1 million tons carbon dioxide \nequivalent annually from less fossil fuel use through clean technology \nand practice applications.  \n \nEnergy efficiency thus will reduce public sector expenditures on energy \nand improve livelihoods in rural and urban communities. Implementation \nprogress and achievements will be monitored against the performance \ntargets and indicators included in the Investment Program's design and \nmonitoring framework. \n \nFinancial  outlays  on  power  generation  projects  will  be  cut  and \nuneconomical standby capacity required to cater for peak loads will be \nminimized. The need for energy subsidies will be reduced. Transmission \nand distribution system expansion needs will be deferred, thereby saving \npublic funds and increasing returns on all energy investments. Energy \nefficiency  adds  more  supply  capacity.  The  potential  is  real  since \ninvestments are in technologies that are known, proven, bankable, and low \nrisk in nature.  \n \n \n ", "viii  \nSecure and reliable energy supply will improve energy access. Through \ncost savings, energy efficiency will generate more income for women and \nhouseholds. Industrial competitiveness will be increased and more jobs \nwill be created. It will also facilitate a viable energy audit and management \nindustry,  and  eventual  market  transformation  in  favor  of  clean  energy \nproducts and services. \n \nThe Investment Program will support gender mainstreaming into energy \npolicies. The road map provides specific measures to allow the needs of \nboth men and women to be considered in all planning and policymaking. A \ngender sensitive energy policy would recognize that women and men have \ndifferent energy needs due to their differing household roles, responses to \ncrises, and coping mechanisms; and would offer energy technologies and \nservices that match those needs.  \n \nEnergy efficiency directly leads to a cleaner environment as a result of \nreduced  GHG  emissions.  Substantial  regional  and  global  benefits  are \nexpected. Specific project sponsors will also benefit from carbon revenues \ngenerated  under  the  Investment  Program.  The  National  CFL  Project \n(under tranche 1) will reduce emissions by 7 million tons of carbon dioxide. \n \nThe direct economic benefits of the CFL project include reduced peak \ndemand  by  use  of  energy-efficient  lighting  devices.  This  will  result  in \nsavings of about $177 million (2,132 GWh) per annum from avoided fuel \ncost and deferral of an investment of $1.84 billion in power generation and \nassociated network capacity of 1.6 GWh, which is about 9% of Pakistan's \navailable generation capacity. Poor customers (particularly women and \nchildren) will particularly benefit, as lighting is a significant component of \ntheir electricity consumption. As much as $800 million could be saved by \nparticipating households over the project life. These households will also \nbenefit from improved quality lighting. \n   \nRisks and  A risk assessment was conducted. The Investment Program risks are \nAssumptions  (i)  political,  (ii) institutional,  and  (iii)  management.  Technical  risks  for \nenergy efficiency projects are assessed as relatively low. Energy efficiency \nprograms  can  be  successful  only  if  the  underlying  incentives  of  the \nregulatory  framework  are  in  place  and  correct.  For  this,  political \ncommitment and a policy framework are critical. \n \nLack of tariff increases and the resulting shortage of funds for investment, \nmaintenance, and augmentation have compromised the financial viability \nof the power sector. The Government is taking steps through the power \nsector circular debt resolution plan to establish financial sustainability. The \nplan principles are (i) policy debt resolution, (ii) technical and financial \nimprovement of company performance, and (iii) timely implementation of a \ncost recovery tariff. The implementation of the plan will align the incentives \nfor conservation and energy efficiency. Considerable political commitment \nwill be needed to carry out the reforms. Close monitoring and coordination \nwith the Government and other partners will be vital. \n \n \n ", "  ix\nThe Investment Program needs good institutions and strong management \nand governance. Good planning, best practice concepts, sound project \nmanagement, fiduciary oversight, and transparent bidding and contract \nmanagement processes require not only experienced personnel, but also \nefficient  and  effective  systems,  procedures,  and  controls.  On  the \ninstitutional  front,  coordination  for  energy  efficiency  planning  and \nimplementation has been lacking within the Government and with external \npartners.  Considerable  responsibility  is  placed  on  the  Planning \nCommission's  ability  to  manage  the  road  map  and  the  Investment \nProgram.

In FY2008, Pakistan\u2019s economy deteriorated after 5 years of steady growth based on \nexpansionary policy and structural reforms. This slowdown was partially caused by increased \ninternational fuel and food prices, and aggravated by the domestic political transition. The \nenergy shortage crisis, which started in FY2007, worsened during FY2008\u2013FY2009, further \nstraining the national budget and growth. The power supply deficit reached 5,000 megawatts \n(MW) during the summer peak in FY2009. Extended power outages, lasting more than 12 hours \na day in many areas, and gas shortages during the 4 winter months have had a negative effect \non people and businesses.  \n \n3.  The economy grew at an annual average of 7% during FY2004\u2013FY2008; this translated \ninto a rapid increase in energy demand of about 8.4% per year. However, the primary energy \nsupply increased at only 6% per year during this time. In FY2008, the primary energy supply \nwas 63 million tons of oil equivalent (Mtoe), and comprised natural gas (47.5%), oil (30.5%), \nhydropower (10.9%), coal (9.2%), liquefied petroleum gas (0.7%), and nuclear power (1.2%). \nPakistan is a net energy importer; the oil import bill was $12 billion in FY2008. Based on low-\ncase gross domestic product (GDP) growth forecasts of 4%, the total annual energy demand is \nexpected to double to 122 Mtoe in 10 years. At a conservative crude oil price of $50/barrel, the \nannual energy import bill would exceed $27 billion by FY2018. \n \n4.  The energy gap is a binding constraint, as energy security underpins all aspects of \neconomic growth. The energy sector is now gripped with the reality of energy vulnerability, fuel \nprice volatility, the financial crisis, and system unreliability. Forecasts of global energy demand \nsuggest  that  prices  will  remain  high  and  volatile  well  into  the  future.  Pakistan  relies  on \nreasonably  priced  energy  as  a  precondition  for  sustained  economic  development.  These \ncontinuing energy insecurities have immediate consequences for poverty and economic growth. \n \n5.  Energy  efficiency  options  are  an  underlying  theme  in  addressing  energy  security \nproblems and mitigating the impact of climate change. The rationale for investing in energy \nefficiency\u2014from economic, social, environmental perspectives\u2014has become even more critical \nfor Pakistan. Managing growing energy demand through the application of energy efficiency \ntechnologies and services is the most cost-effective way to achieve energy security and sustain \nlow-carbon growth. \n  \n6.  Pakistan will have multiple benefits from investing in clean energy and energy efficiency. \nThe impacts can be shared globally. Addressing climate change by improving energy efficiency1 \n                                                 \n1  Energy efficiency is defined as economic investments in energy generation; delivery; and end-use equipment, \nfacilities, buildings, and infrastructure that deliver higher useful energy outputs or services. Energy efficiency \nresults in (i) lower consumption of energy, measured as energy input per unit of delivered output or service; and \n(ii) reduced emissions of greenhouse gases. ADB. 2006. Report of the Energy Efficiency Initiative. Manila. ", "2     \nand expanding clean technology is a core operating area under the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) Strategy 2020.2 ADB's Energy Policy also aims to help developing member countries \nprovide  reliable,  adequate,  and  affordable  energy  for  inclusive  growth  in  a  socially, \neconomically, and environmentally sustainable manner.3 Energy efficiency is one of the three \npillars of the policy; the other two are (i) access to energy for all; and (ii) energy sector reform, \ncapacity building, and governance. \n \n7.  Energy efficiency is a strategic intervention under ADB\u2019s Pakistan Country Partnership \nStrategy for 2009\u20132013.4 The partnership strategy is fully consistent with the ADB strategy and \nenergy policy. Key drivers are energy security, energy efficiency, and clean energy. ADB is \ncontinuing  to  support  energy  sector  investments  in  the  power  supply  chain  (generation, \ntransmission, and distribution), reforms (including strengthening corporate governance in power \nentities  and  granting  them  greater  financial  autonomy),  and  capacity  development  of  key \nagencies (including improving financial management and procurement practices, addressing the \nproblems of circular debt and the debt overhang, and rationalizing tariff structures).  \n \n8.  The  Government  is  keen  to  invest  in  clean  technology  and  to  encourage  market \ntransformation to improve efficiency for energy supply and demand. The Government requested \nADB support for the development of an investment program in this field.5 This intervention \nresults from a 10-year policy dialogue with Pakistan, and is fully in line with ADB\u2019s Strategy \n2020, Energy Policy, and Energy Efficiency Initiative. \n \n9.  The Investment Program provides the foundation for sustainable financing for priority \nprojects. The demonstration effect of these projects will encourage private sector investments \ninto energy efficiency and thus help engage the private sector. A sound road map, detailed \npolicy frameworks, and clear energy-specific investment plans are in place; and each project \nentity has sufficient implementation capacity to handle energy efficiency transactions. \n \n10.  Policy  Framework.  Pakistan\u2019s  development  priorities  are  given  in  the  Vision  2030 \ndocument.6  It stresses structural change and greater productivity.  The medium-term development \nframework for 2005\u20132010 shows priority investments in key sectors. The Poverty Reduction \nStrategy (2003)7 highlights the need for macroeconomic restructuring, removal of infrastructure \nbottlenecks, and private sector participation. The Government intends to align these three \nstrategic documents over the short term, while calling for improved project implementation, \nsounder public financial resources management, stakeholder consultations, and delivery of \nresults.  \n \n11.  The energy efficiency policy framework is set in the National Energy Conservation Policy \nadopted in 2006. It calls for maximized savings through rational use and application of clean \nenergy technology. An integrated institutional structure and resource allocation is prescribed to \nsupplement implementation. Policy implementation has been slow due to lack of coordination \n                                                 \n2  ADB. 2008.

Energy  security  and  affordability  are  priorities  under  the  Government's \nenergy sector strategy and policies. Energy efficiency is a key part of this strategy, and is \nbacked by a road map (Appendix 2). This sets out a strategy for clean energy and low-carbon \ngrowth, and an action plan covering investments and institutional change. Specifically, it aims to \n(i) integrate energy policy and the regulatory frameworks; (ii) mainstream energy efficiency into \nnational planning; (iii) rationalize energy pricing; (iv) create fiscal and financial incentives; (v) \nestablish  technology  standards,  certification,  and  testing  regimes;  and  (vi)  improve  the \ninformation flow on energy efficiency, financing, technology, and support services. The road \nmap was prepared through a consultative approach by the Energy Efficiency and Conservation \nConsultative Group (EECCG).8 The Planning Commission chairs the EECCG, which includes \npublic and private sector stakeholders as well as development partners as its members.  \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities  \n13.  The energy gap results from (i) weak sector planning and management, (ii) poor sector \nperformance, (iii) increasing demand, and (iv) inefficient use of energy resources. The problem \nanalysis is shown in Appendix 3. Lack of investment in replacing obsolete technology and \ninfrastructure is a cause for inefficiencies. High energy losses and wastage throughout the value \nchain result in high energy intensity. Pakistan uses 15% more energy than India and 25% more \nthan the Philippines for each dollar of GDP produced. Industrial production is impacted by high \nenergy prices and low and unreliable supply. Production costs are high, making businesses less \ncompetitive. \n \n14.  The Government is struggling to resolve the energy shortage crisis. Ad hoc measures, \nsuch as rental power generation programs, are having a limited impact. Meanwhile, public \ndissatisfaction is increasing due to persistent power shortages and high energy prices. The \ndemand and supply gap can be bridged by (i) increasing supply through new capacity additions \nand improved sector performance, and (ii) increasing supply and curbing demand through \nenergy efficiency and demand-side management. The energy gap will continue to remain until \nboth measures are effectively implemented.  \n \n15.  Increasing supply capacity takes time and is expensive. Commission of major power \ngeneration and natural gas supply additions will begin in 2013. Pakistan is attempting to change \nits energy mix by exploring its hydropower and coal resources; however, these projects will take \ntime. Reliance on thermal generation with imported fuel oil is expected to increase in the short \nterm. Energy efficiency thus is the least-cost and most climate-friendly way of bridging the \nenergy gap and securing energy provision. Domestic energy prices will continue to increase \nwith tariff rationalization and removal of subsidies. Energy efficiency reduces the energy bill for \nall energy customers.  \n \n                                                 \n8  EECCG membership includes representatives of the Economic Affairs Division; ministries of finance, water and \npower,  petroleum  and  natural  resources,  environment,  and  industries  and  production;  National  Energy \nConservation  Centre; Pakistan Electric Power Company; Pakistan Standards and  Quality Control Authority; \nHydrocarbon Development Institute; Pakistan Council for Industrial and Scientific Research; and development \npartners (ADB, Agence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement, German development cooperation through GTZ, Japan \nInternational  Cooperation  Agency,  United  Nations  Development  Programme,  United  Nations  Industrial \nDevelopment Organization, United States Agency for International Development, and the World Bank). \n ", "4     \n16.  Rising energy prices are a large burden on the Government budget and customers\u2019 \nenergy bills. High international fuel prices and volatility are undermining energy security. Since \nFY1998, prices of energy products have continually increased. For example, the price of natural \ngas increased by 274% for residential customers from FY1998 to FY2008, and 125% from \nFY2005 to FY2008. For commercial and industrial customers, it increased by 250% and 126%, \nover the same two periods. Fuel oil prices increased by 566% from FY1998 to FY2008 and by \n230% from FY2005 to FY2008. Power generation costs have increased, as oil-based thermal \npower plants account for 68% of generating capacity. Electricity tariffs are expected to be \nincreased in increments starting in October 2009 to reach cost recovery, and Government \nsubsidies are to be eliminated by FY2011. The Government budgeted PRs55 billion for a tariff \ndifferential subsidy to cover the incremental increase. Monthly tariff adjustments for fuel costs \nare designed to keep the subsidy within the budget as the increases are made according to the \nimplementation plan.9   \n \n17.  The private sector plays a key role in sustaining growth momentum and in creating the \njobs needed to absorb the rapidly growing labor force. Energy shortages are the most severe \nobstacle to doing business in Pakistan. For example, captive power generation is expensive \n($0.20\u2013$0.30  per  kilowatt-hour)  and  drives  up  production  costs.  The  country  partnership \nstrategy (footnote 4) defines energy infrastructure bottlenecks and shallow financial services \nindustry  as  key  constraints  that  increase  the  cost  of  doing  business  in  the  country.  The \nunreliable infrastructure, coupled with rising cost of energy products, affects companies\u2019 bottom \nlines and increases production costs. Industries are not investing in energy efficiency as it \ndirectly competes with production.10 No available financing is dedicated for energy efficiency. \nBanks do not have capacity to undertake due diligence on such projects.  \n \n18.  ADB\u2019s assessment11 of energy efficiency in Pakistan found that the Government needs \nto integrate energy efficiency into the overall energy strategy and mainstream energy efficiency \ninto development planning and investment (Supplementary Appendix A). Lack of financing is a \nkey  barrier  to  energy  efficiency.  The  Government  needs  a  flexible  public  sector  financing \nmechanism to deliver priority projects that will result in energy savings, lower energy intensity, \nreduced greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and increased industrial competitiveness. \n \n1.  Physical Challenges \na.  Supply Side  \n19.  The total installed power generation capacity in Pakistan is 19,420 MW.12 However, only \n14,000  MW  of  firm  capacity  was  available  in  2009  because  of  technical  and  financial \nconstraints.  The  shortfall  in  electricity  supply  has  resulted  in  power  rationing  during  peak \ndemand since FY2007. The rationing will continue until capacity additions catch up with peak \ndemand. About two thirds of total electricity is generated from thermal power plants using \nnatural gas and fuel oil. The lack of natural gas supply to the energy sector has increased \nreliance on imported fuel oil, which has increased the cost of power as well as decreased \n                                                 \n9 The actual cost increase necessary to reach cost recovery will be determined by the National Electric Power \nRegulatory Authority. The current estimate is a total cost increase of 25.8% with three increases during FY2010.  \n10 A survey of 650 small- and medium-sized manufacturing enterprises concludes that almost 80% did not intend to \nmake new investments from 2009 to 2013, mainly because of expensive and unreliable energy supply. \n11 ADB. 2007. Implementing Energy Efficiency in Pakistan. Manila. The report was prepared under ADB. 2006. \nTechnical Assistance for Supporting the Inception of the Energy Efficiency Initiative in Developing Member \nCountries. Manila.  \n12 About 2,000 MW of additional capacity will be required annually to keep up with economic growth projections in the \nmedium-term development framework. \n ", "    5\noutput. Public sector thermal power plants are dilapidated, operating at 25% reduced output, \nand at much lower efficiency rates than similar plants elsewhere. This is a result of inadequate \nmaintenance. Forced outage rates for these plants are at 12%, or double that of independent \npower producers.  \n \n20.  In FY2008, production of natural gas peaked at 113 million standard cubic meters per \nday (MMSCMD), compared to a demand of 127 MMSCMD. Since FY2007, the country has \nfaced gas shortages during the winter months, when supplies to industry and thermal power \ngeneration had to be cut to meet the heating needs of households.13  \n \n21.  The energy system also experiences high transformation losses. Despite improvements \nin  recent  years,  systemwide  transmission  and  distribution  losses  remain  high  at  23.4%  of \ndispatched power, and close to 8% in the case of gas supply. The Government is investing in \npower transmission, distribution rehabilitation, and expansion. These investments will improve \nefficiency and reduce losses. The gas transmission and distribution system is also aging. High \ntechnical losses occur because of inefficient compressors. Due to the shortage of financing, gas \nutilities are delaying investment into replacing these compressor units, which could double \ncompressor efficiency, save 3,500 billion British thermal units of gas per year, and enable \n450 GWh of additional generation annually (120 MW of capacity).  \n \n22.  Clean technology investment in thermal power generation, and gas transmission and \ndistribution will deliver the highest energy savings. Savings in power generation14 are estimated \nat 1.2 Mtoe (55,070 TJ) in FY2019 (Table 1). These savings constitute 28% of total realizable \ndemand- and supply-side savings in FY2019 for the priority sectors, requiring an investment of  \n$1.37 billion. Savings from loss reduction in gas transmission networks are $130 million (3%). \nTotal requirements on the supply side amount to $1.5 billion.  \n \nb.  Demand Side    \n23.  During FY2002\u2013FY2007, electricity consumption rose by 6.8% per year, natural gas by \n10.4%, liquefied petroleum gas by 17.6%, and coal by 22.8%. Only oil consumption leveled off \ntemporarily due to large-scale fuel switching in the power and cement industries\u2014displaced by \nnatural gas and coal\u2014and transport system alignment, due to increasing use of compressed \nnatural gas in vehicles. Still, oil imports in FY2008 rose by 5.6%, but the cost increased by \n60.4% because of worldwide price increases. \n  \n24.  Peak demand for electricity increased by 34% from FY2004 to FY2009. This was driven \nby the rapid increase in household appliance use, the result of rising incomes and a burgeoning \nconsumer financing market. This led to a shortfall of 4,000\u20135,000 MW, corresponding to 25%\u2013\n30% of peak demand. Only about 55% of the population have access to grid-supplied electricity. \n \n25.  Households in Pakistan accounted for about half of total electricity consumption in 2008. \nLighting, along with air conditioning in the summer, is the main driver of peak loads in this \nsector.  Inefficient  household  and  commercial  appliances  are  causing  a  huge  burden  on \navailable energy supply.  \n \n26.  The industry sector is energy-intensive. It accounted for 19% of GDP in FY2008, but was \nthe  biggest  energy  user  with  43%  of  total  energy  consumption.  This  is  primarily  due  to \n                                                 \n13  Power plants currently report a shortage of 10 MMSCMD of natural gas. Every 2.8 MMSCMD of natural gas \nsupplied to the power subsector saves approximately PRs1.4 billion in power generation cost.  \n14  Thermal plants selected based on lower efficiency and lower payback criteria. \n ", "6     \ndilapidated infrastructure and inefficient technology in use. Low energy productivity is a factor \naffecting industrial competitiveness, and the cost of doing business. \n \n27.  Demand-side  savings  in  FY2008  are  estimated  at  3 Mtoe  (134,411  TJ),  which \ncorresponds to 8% of the total energy consumed in the country (Table 1). Realizable energy \nsavings in the industry sector correspond to 8% of current sector consumption; in the domestic \nsector it is 21%. Energy savings between FY2010 and FY2019 are estimated at 3.13 Mtoe \n(138,206 TJ). Investment costs are estimated at $2.3 billion. The highest energy savings will be \nin the domestic (lighting and appliances) and industry (technology retrofits) sectors. The bulk of \nthe investment will be required in 2009\u20132013 to replace inefficient equipment, followed by \nadditional investments to maintain efficiency in sectors where, due to market imperatives, the \ninduction of lower efficiency equipment is expected to continue into the near future. \nTable 1: Summary of Savings and Investment Requirements \nInvestment \nEnergy Consumed, FY2008  Energy Savings, FY2019  Required  \nPriority Sector  (\u2019000 toe)  (TJ)  (\u2019000 toe)  (TJ)  ($ million)  \nDemand Side           \n  Domestic   8,046  355,659  1,685  74,469  370 \n  Industry  16,804  742,776  1,442  63,736  1,908 \n  Subtotal      3,127  138,206  2,278 \nSupply Side       \n  Power Generation  1,246  55,070  1,372 \n  Transmission and Distribution (gas)   132  5,853  130 \n  Subtotal       1,378  60,923  1,502 \nTotal      4,505  199,129  3,780 \nFY = fiscal year, TJ = terajoule, toe = ton of oil equivalent. \nSource:  Government of Pakistan, Planning Commission. 2009.

Past attempts to translate energy efficiency and energy conservation15 into policy and \nactions failed due to financing barriers and limited political commitment. The mainstreaming of \nenergy  efficiency  into  policy  and  planning  marks  a  radical  change.  This  creates  major \nopportunity for investments. A holistic platform for energy efficiency is required to create a \nsustainable policy and regulatory framework; an integration of energy efficiency throughout \nnational  planning  and  public  investments;  energy  price  and  utility  rate-setting  reforms  and \nincentives;  a  strong  equipment  standards,  certification,  and  testing  regime;  and  easy, \nwidespread access to energy efficiency-specific information, financing, products, and services \nby  all  categories  and  levels  of  energy  market  participants  and  end-users.  An  institutional \ncapacity assessment is in Supplementary Appendix B. \n \n29.  No integrated platform is in place for energy sector strategy and policy making. This is \nidentified as one of the key reasons for the current energy shortage crisis. The Ministry of Water \nand Power (MOWP) and Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Resources are responsible for their \nrespective  subsectors.  However,  coordination  between  the  two  is  weak.  Responsibility  for \nclimate change is with the Ministry of Environment, which lacks the mandate and capacity to \nundertake  such  work.  The  overall  planning  and  investment  approval  mandate  is  with  the \nPlanning Commission, as such, it is the only available platform to integrate the planning. Energy \n                                                 \n15  In Pakistan, the term \u201cenergy conservation\u201d is sometimes used interchangeably with the term \u201cenergy efficiency.\u201d  \n ", "    7\nefficiency covers multiple subsectors and requires an institutional structure that is functional and \neffective. Energy policies also need to reflect the needs of women and men. The Government \nand stakeholders recognize these fundamental weaknesses and agree on the need for reform. \n \n30.  Planning Commission. The Planning Commission is the federal government institution \nresponsible for economic planning and development. Its main function is to prepare strategic \nplanning and policy of the Government, including public sector development programs; and to \napprove  and  monitor  public  investment  projects.  The  commission  is  also  responsible  for \nintegrated energy strategy and planning. It thus has an overarching, cross-ministerial and cross-\nsectoral advisory and coordination mandate for the energy sector. The Office of the Member \n(Energy), Planning Commission is in charge of these functions. ADB is supporting the strategic \nplanning and development capacity of this office through an advisory technical assistance on \nthe Integrated Energy Model.16  This would provide the Government with a tool to develop energy \nstrategy and policy based on objective sectorwide analysis.  \n \n31.  National Energy Conservation Centre. The center was established in 1985 and is the \nGovernment\u2019s focal point on energy efficiency. It was originally set up under the Planning \nCommission and was supported by the United States Agency for International Development's \n(USAID) technical and financial assistance. Since 1990, when USAID stopped the support, the \ncenter has been severely underresourced and moved under several line ministries; it is now \nunder the Ministry of Environment. It has lost its key technical staff; professional facilities; \nbusiness processes; and the knowledge base required to fulfill its mandate for coordinating, \npromoting, and facilitating national energy efficiency actions and creating an enabling business \nenvironment. As a result, the center\u2019s reputation has suffered, and it lost credibility within the \nGovernment and among stakeholders, including the private sector.  \n \nb.  Governance  \n32.  ADB\u2019s comprehensive governance assessment for the energy sector identified several \nchallenges (fragmentation of functions and lack of integrated planning). Sector reforms have not \nyet been fully implemented. While the unbundling process is completed in the power subsector, \nthe entities created out of the Water and Power Development Authority still lack independence \nfrom one another. Activities are under way to improve corporate autonomy, cut the circular debt \nbetween companies, and increase financial management standards.  \n \n33.  Since FY2002, electricity tariffs have been kept below cost. The difference between the \ntariff determined by the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority, the regulator, at cost-\nrecovery and that notified by the Government was never recovered by power entities, leading to \na circular debt situation. This difference was exasperated by escalating fuel prices in FY2008. \nThe Government took the first bold step by increasing the customer tariff by 20% in FY2008, but \nthe circular debt rose to PRs308 billion. Since the tariff paid by customers and tariff differential \nsubsidies did not cover costs, the distribution companies (DISCOs) could not fully pay for the \nsupply and thus payments to fuel suppliers were constrained by the generating companies. Also \nthe shortage in gas supply to the power subsector decreased the capacity by around 500 MW. \nTo alleviate the crisis and prevent reoccurrence, the Government set out a plan (Supplementary \nAppendix C), which includes (i) tariff issues, (ii) circular debt, and (iii) performance of power \ncompanies. \n   \n                                                 \n16 ADB. 2007. Technical Assistance to Pakistan for the Integrated Energy Model. Manila. \n ", "8     \nc.  Standards and Testing \n34.  Enforcement of standards is generally weak. Successful energy efficiency investments, \nparticularly in terms of demand-side management, need to be underpinned by comprehensive \nenergy performance standards and a testing regime. The Pakistan Standards and Quality Control \nAuthority is the national standardization body. Quality standards are in place for lighting and some \nelectrical appliances, but these do not adequately cover all main product categories, types, or \nsizes, nor are they properly enforced. Quality and performance standards need to be harmonized \nwith international standards. The Pakistan Council of Scientific and Industrial Research is the \nnational testing and certification body with seven regional laboratories. Equipment testing facilities \nneed to be rapidly augmented to enable the council to obtain international accreditation and \nundertake energy performance testing.  \n \n3.  Case for Energy Efficiency  \n35.  Increasing energy costs and demand make energy efficiency an absolute priority. Public \nfinancing and policy incentives will encourage businesses to invest in clean technology and \nenergy efficiency. Priority investments will help to reduce energy consumption and improve \nproduction. Power and gas rationing and forced outages will be minimized. The social and \neconomic  benefits  are  high,  with  a  multiplier  effect  on  society  through  productive  use  of \nconsumers\u2019 time and money. Utility revenues will increase, resulting in improved service quality \nand financial performance. The cross-subsidy provided by utilities to low-income customers will \nbe reduced. \n \n36.  Energy  efficiency  will  generate  \u201cnegawatts,\u201d  which  cost  a  fraction  of  equivalent \nmegawatts. It is the least-cost and shortest way to bridge the energy gap. The energy demand \nscenario, with and without energy efficiency, is shown in Appendix 3. The marginal cost of \nadditional supply is much higher than the cost of investing in energy efficiency. The dispatch of \nthe highest-cost generation plants will drop and result in financial gains for companies and the \nGovernment. Stress on the transmission and distribution systems will be decreased. \n \n37.  Energy efficiency is a low-carbon growth path. Deployment of clean technology and \npractice reduces GHG emissions and helps Pakistan achieve energy security through climate-\nfriendly means. \n \n38.  Investment Requirement. The Energy Efficiency Investment Program for 2009\u20132018 \n(Table 2) is estimated to cost $3.8 billion (Supplementary Appendix D). The returns from energy \nefficiency investments in Pakistan can be high and the technical risks relatively low. This plan is \nbased  on  clean  technology  projects  in  priority  sectors.  It  also  includes  a  comprehensive \ninstitutional  development  program  to  strengthen  the  policy,  regulatory,  and  institutional \nframework and capacity. It assumes that no external barriers to such actions\u2014in the form of \nfinancing, information and technology access, policy and pricing disincentives, and other such \nconstraints\u2014exist.  \n \n ", "    9\nTable 2: Energy Efficiency Annual Investment Requirement \n($ million) \nPriority Area  2009  2010  2011  2012  2013  2014  2015  2016  2017  2018 \nDomestic  28  83  27  80  89  63  \u2013  \u2013  \u2013  \u2013 \nIndustry  \u2013  19  114  343  553  517  267  76  19 \u2013 \nPower Generation  \u2013  \u2013  153  210  150  135  202  272  183 67 \nTransmission and Distribution  \u2013  16  42  44  28  \u2013  \u2013  \u2013  \u2013  \u2013 \n  Total   28  118  336  674  820  713  469  348  202 67 \n  Cumulative  28  146  482  1,159  1,979  2,694  3,163  3,511  3,713 3,780 \nSource: Government of Pakistan, Planning Commission. 2009. Energy Efficiency Investment Plan. Islamabad. \n \n4.  Rationale for Multitranche Financing Facility Modality \n \n39.  The Government requested a flexible public sector financing mechanism to support \nclean technology investments in the short to medium term. The MFF modality is considered the \nmost appropriate modality for clean technology and energy efficiency investments in Pakistan. \nThe preconditions for the use of an MFF have been fully met as follows.  \n \n40.  Road Map. The Government has adopted a clear and sound strategic multisector road \nmap for energy efficiency. The MFF provides a mechanism to overcome financial barriers to \nrealizing the road map targets. The road map is based on extensive consultations and inputs \nfrom all stakeholders.  \n \n41.  Strategic Context. ADB\u2019s Pakistan country partnership strategy (footnote 4) has energy \nefficiency as a core intervention area. This Investment Program is a continuation of a 10-year \npolicy dialogue. The projected investments are consistent and closely linked to ongoing ADB \nenergy sector interventions\u2014renewable energy, generation (mostly private sector in nature), \ntransmission, and distribution. These operations also fit with the latest negotiations with the \nGovernment on policy reforms\u2014circular debt, tariff regime, and the National Electric Power \nRegulatory Authority Act. The MFF fits well within the strategic framework of Pakistan and ADB. \n \n42.  Policy Framework. The Government has a policy framework that calls for maximizing \nenergy savings by rational and efficient use in all sectors. An integrated institutional structure and \nresource allocation is required for its implementation. The MFF will provide institutional and financial \nsupport to key stakeholders in strengthening and implementing the respective policy actions. \n \n43.  Safeguards. The Investment Program has a comprehensive environmental framework. \nThe MFF will allow for preparation of appropriate environmental and social safeguards plans \nand mitigation measures for each tranche project. \n \n44.  Undertakings. The Government has agreed to a set of commitments aimed to establish \na  dynamic  business  environment  for  the  sustained  transformation  of  the  energy  efficiency \nmarket;  and  scale  up  deployment  of  proven  technologies  through  public  investments  and \nfostering private investment. The MFF allows consistent engagement with the Government in \nmonitoring the progress of the commitments, and where needed, provide advisory support to \nachieve the targets.  \n \n45.  Investment  and  Financing  Plan.  There  is  a  comprehensive  10-year  investment \nprogram ($3.8 billion) comprising a variety of sequenced supply- and demand-side investments \nin priority sectors and institutional development (i.e., capacity building, governance, gender, \n ", "10    \nsafeguards, and project preparation and implementation). An indicative financing plan is defined \n(Table 3). The Government is actively looking for funding from external and domestic sources. \nThe private sector is expected to finance 49%, including domestic and external commercial \nborrowing and equity investments. Official external borrowing (i.e., from international financial \ninstitutions, bilateral agencies, and export\u2013import banks) is expected to cover 35%. ADB and \nAFD financing will be through this MFF, which will act as the anchor for the investment plan and \nas the front-runner for commercial investments. The MFF will finance a slice of the investment \nprogram, and offers the Government a choice of financing instruments. The MFF also provides \na strategic financing partnership platform. Active consultations with other parties are ongoing to \nattract other cofinanciers for future MFF tranches.  \n \nTable 3: Indicative Energy Efficiency Financing Plan \n($ million) \nSource  Amount\nGovernment of Pakistan  600\nOfficial External   \n  Asian Development Bank  780 \n  Agence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppementa    200 \n  United States Agency for International Development b  30 \n  Others  320 \nCommercial Domestic  900 \nCommercial External  950 \nTotal  3,780 \na \u20ac150 million equivalent. \nb Additional financing is being planned. \nSources: Asian Development Bank and Planning Commission estimates. \n \n5.  External Assistance \n46.  The  Government  wants  a  medium-term  partnership  and  commitment  from  the \ndevelopment financiers in implementing energy efficiency in the country. The EECCG provides \na functional platform for collaboration among all stakeholders and financiers. Development \npartners\u2019 actions are directly linked and coordinated under the road map. A matrix of institutional \nresponsibilities was prepared to complement the road map. \n \n47.  AFD is a cofinancier of this Investment Program. The Japan International Cooperation \nAgency  is  developing  a  national  climate  change  policy  program.  German  development \ncooperation  through  GTZ  is  implementing  industrial  energy  audits,  appliance  labeling,  and \ncertification  programs.  USAID  is  implementing  a  large  technical  assistance  program  to \nstrengthen energy demand-side management capacity in the utilities and the private sector. The \nWorld Bank is implementing utility-based demand-side management demonstration programs. \n \n48.  In the overall energy sector, ADB is the largest development partner, followed by the \nWorld Bank and Japan International Cooperation Agency. The European Investment Bank has \nsigned up to a cofinancing partnership with ADB in the area of renewable energy. The Islamic \nDevelopment Bank is financing small hydropower projects in Northern Pakistan. \n \n49.  The Canadian International Development Agency has been helping with energy policy \nand regulations, and hydropower projects. It has also supported public and private companies \nwith reforms in the management of hydrocarbon resources. The Government of France is \n ", "   11\nworking on mini-hydropower projects in the North-West Frontier Province. The Government of \nGermany is supporting renewable energy projects, and the Government of Japan is supporting \nthe  modernization  and  expansion  of  the  power  transmission  and  distribution  system.  The \nGovernment of the Netherlands is supporting the introduction of clean industrial production. \nUSAID is working on energy policy, pricing, and capacity development. USAID is also planning \nto substantially expand its energy program starting from 2010. \n \n6.  Asian Development Bank Operations  \n50.  ADB provides about one third of total external assistance to the energy sector, and has \nthe largest portfolio of ongoing projects. It has been engaged in reforms, capacity development \nactivities,  and  private  sector  participation.  Physical  investments  have  focused  on  power \ngeneration, transmission, and distribution. Since the start of operations in Pakistan in 1968, total \nlending to the sector amounts to about $4.2 billion, of which $3.6 billion is for power and  \n$0.6  billion  for  natural  gas  and  petroleum  development.  In  2009,  the  energy  portfolio  has \nreceived three MFFs, totaling $2.1 billion and covering renewable energy, power transmission, \nand power distribution. Technical assistance areas include integrated energy planning model, \ntariff rationalization, and institutional strengthening and restructuring. \n \n51.  A  country  assistance  program  evaluation  completed  in  May  2007  assessed  the \ndevelopment impact of ADB\u2019s strategy and operations during 1985\u20132006. While the evaluation \nconfirms that ADB\u2019s development responsiveness and credibility is recognized in Pakistan, \nADB\u2019s overall program and sector performance was rated \u201cpartly successful.\u201d The evaluation \nfound ADB\u2019s performance to be mixed, in terms of contribution to development results, and \npointed to areas where program and sector improvements were needed. The evaluation found \nthat the large ADB program covered too many sectors and interventions with too few staff, \ncomplex project designs hindered implementation, analytical work to support policy dialogue in \nimportant sectors had gaps, and public sector operations significantly outnumbered those in the \nprivate sector. Operations in the energy sector were rated \u201csuccessful.\u201d17 \n \n7.  Lessons  \n52.  The energy sector needs substantial investments. Consistent policy dialogue is required \nto achieve sustained progress and ensure maximum impact. Development partners have a \ncontinuing role to play in reforms and financing. The reforms, while complex, are taking longer \nthan  anticipated.  Sector  regulation  and  pricing  is  conceptually  sufficient.  However,  political \ninfluence in the decisions has been significant. Power unbundling and restructuring has been \nachieved legally. However, power utilities lack the financial autonomy needed to make sound \ncommercial decisions and investment in system maintenance, operations, and expansion.  \n \n53.  ADB strategy has focused on supporting power transmission and distribution companies \nin achieving financial autonomy and improving service. ADB financing is most useful if it is \nleveraged by working with other sources of finance, both public and private. ADB and the World \nBank have clear and focused financing interventions backed by institutional reform and capacity \ndevelopment  support.  The  World  Bank  is  supporting  public  sector  power  entities,  and  is \npromoting performance contracts as a way of increasing accountability and efficiency in the \nsector. MOWP supports this approach.  \n \n                                                 \n17  The overall success rate of energy sector projects during 1985\u20132006 was a high 81%. The success rate for \nprojects approved in the 1990s was, however, much lower at 50%. \n ", "12    \n54.  Most ADB-financed projects in the energy sector have been sector loans. The more \nrecent  additions  are  MFFs.  The  latter  allows  flexibility  in  project  selection  and  project \nmanagement, while maintaining focus on reforms and performance. Cost overruns have been \ngreatly  reduced,  although  implementation  remains  slow.  Delays  have  been  caused  by \ncumbersome government internal approval process (i.e., Project Cycle-I [PC-I] and Project \nCycle-II  [PC-II])  for  physical  investments  and  recruitment  of  consultants.  This  is  due  to \norganizational and institutional weaknesses, and shortage of qualified staff.  \n \n55.  Specific lessons from previous projects18 involve (i) inadequate stakeholder consultations \nduring the design stage, (ii) weak management, (iii) lack of advance actions, (iv) long delays in \nthe  approval  of  umbrella  PC-I  and  individual  tranche  PC-Is,  and  (v) inadequate  project \nmanagement skills.  \n \n56.  The Investment Program addresses these concerns, and incorporates PC-I approvals \ninto project readiness criteria. The umbrella PC-I for the MFF was approved at the MFF fact-\nfinding stage. Procurement was initiated subsequent to Management endorsement of advance \naction.  The  facility  administration  manual  (Supplementary  Appendix  E),  prepared  during \nprogram design, defines the roles and responsibilities of each implementing agency as well as \nindividual staff. It also ensures ownership of the implementing agency and targets start-up and \nimplementation  delays.  Extensive  stakeholder  consultations  were  conducted  at  the  sector, \nsubsector levels, and inputs were properly incorporated into the program design.  \n \n57.  To  mitigate  project  development  and  implementation  delays,  program  management \nsupport is provided to help project entities with project preparation and management. The \nInvestment Program will use the systems and capacity that is being created as part of other \nADB-financed projects. Close linkage with existing projects ensures that technical capacity is \nadequate  for  implementation.  Capacity  constraints  will  be  defined  during  early  project \npreparation stages and proper consulting inputs. The MFF allows the flexibility to develop \ncapacity parallel with project development and implementation.   \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED INVESTMENT PROGRAM \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n58.  The Investment Program will bring about major energy savings and cut GHG emissions by \n30% during the 10-years of implementation (2009\u20132018). It will improve Pakistan\u2019s energy security \nand economic competitiveness by lowering energy intensity and improving energy productivity.  \n \n59.  Energy efficiency will help balance energy demand and supply, and optimize the energy \nmix by reducing oil imports. It will slow energy demand and increase supply; and (i) decrease \nlarge financial outlays, (ii) minimize uneconomical standby capacity required to cater to peak \nloads, (iii) reduce subsidies, and (iv) defer transmission and distribution system expansion needs. \n \nB.  Outputs \n60.  The Investment Program will be Pakistan's first tangible step toward a low-carbon growth \npath. It has nonphysical and physical investments. Key outputs include \n                                                 \n18 Ten ADB-financed power projects approved before 1983 were evaluated. All are classified \u201cgenerally successful.\u201d \nThe  evaluation  findings  show  an  average  implementation  delay  of  2.4  years  (78%).  Five  of  the  projects \nexperienced an average cost overrun of about 82%, and the other five an underrun of 28%. \n ", "   13\n \n(i)  energy  efficiency  mainstreamed  into  planning  and  investments;  and  managed \neffectively  under  strengthened  policy,  legal,  and  regulatory  frameworks  and \ninstitutional capacities; \n(ii)  a national energy efficiency standards, testing, and certification regime; \n(iii)  demand-side management mainstreamed in energy utility operations; \n(iv)  electricity peak demand reduced by 1,094 MW ($1.8 billion in avoided generation \ninvestment), and 2,670 GWh (valued at $222 million) electricity saved annually; \n(v)  601,671 ton of oil equivalent (toe) /25,191 TJ (valued at $200 million) energy saved \nannually  from  reducing  transformation  losses  in  power  generation  and  gas \ntransmission; \n(vi)  918,942  toe  /38,474  TJ  (valued  at  $330  million)  energy  saved  annually  from \nreducing gas, oil, and coal use in the domestic and industry sectors; and \n(vii)  GHG emissions cut by 1 million tons carbon dioxide (CO ) annually from decreased \n2\nfossil fuel use through clean technology and practice applications. \n \n61.  The Investment Program will finance operations in the following areas: (i) lighting and \nappliances in domestic, public, and commercial sectors; (ii) energy loss reduction in thermal \npower generation; (iii) energy loss reduction technology in the transmission and distribution \nsystems; and (iv) industrial energy efficiency programs. \n \n62.  Project Selection. The following criteria will be used to select individual projects: energy \nsavings, mature and applicable technologies, financial and economic viability, and residual \nenvironmental and social impacts. Some projects will be demonstration models.  \n \n63.  Tranche  1. Tranche 1 of the MFF will finance two projects: the National Compact \nFluorescent  Lamp  (CFL)  Project  (Appendix  4),  and  the  Investment  Program  Management \nSupport Project (Appendix 5). Table 5 shows the cost estimates and financing plan (details in \nAppendix 6). \n \n64.  The CFL project will replace about 30 million incandescent bulbs in the domestic sector \nwith efficient, high-quality CFLs. The Government will cover the cost of CFL bulk procurement \nand public awareness campaign costs amounting to $65 million equivalent from the ADB and \nAFD loan proceeds and repay from the budget. Eight power distribution companies (DISCOs) \nand Karachi Electric Supply Company will cover the cost of door-to-door CFL delivery ($20 \nmillion equivalent) to registered household customers in their license areas. \n \n65.  The  Investment  Program  Management  Support  Project  will  help  the  Government \nmanage the Investment Program and execute projects under each tranche. It will help with \npolicy  and  institutional  reform,  safeguard  management,  gender  mainstreaming,  financing \ncontrols, monitoring, evaluation, and results reporting. The component will include design and \ndue diligence work for future tranches.  \n \n66.  Tranche 2. The tranche is expected to comprise a $30 million financial intermediary loan \nand  financing  for  a  risk-sharing  demonstration  project  for  industrial  energy  efficiency \n(Supplementary Appendix F). The industry sector is the largest consumer of energy in Pakistan, \nwith significant savings potential in clean and efficient technology, and equipment replacement \nor upgrades. Industrial enterprises that have undergone energy audits are not able to acquire \nthe recommended clean technologies because of the high-cost of debt and inadequate terms \noffered by the banking system. The banks are keen to acquire capacity to assess energy \nefficiency projects and build their clean energy books if they can safely match-fund these assets \n ", "14    \nto mitigate asset\u2013liability mismatch risk. The Ministry of Industries and Production is leading a \nworking group comprising industry representatives and commercial banks under the EECCG to \nfacilitate stakeholder inputs into the facility design. The Government is expected to submit the \nPFR  for  this  project  in  February  2010.  The  project  will  be  implemented  in  18  months.  If \nsuccessful, the financing model will be replicated under subsequent tranches. This project is \nalso linked with USAID and GTZ technical assistance to industries undertaking energy audits \nand for building the capacity of energy service companies. Private energy service companies \nmay be supported under this facility. \n \n67.  Tranche 3. The tranche is expected to support a thermal power plant rehabilitation and \nreplacement project. The project will rehabilitate and replace inefficient facility and equipment \nprioritized  in  the  generation  company  (GENCO)  investment  plan.  ADB  is  assisting  the \nGovernment in conducting a diagnostic assessment of three public sector GENCO assets, \ncomprising six thermal power plants operating on natural gas and furnace oil. The study will \ncompare the present performance with the technological benchmarks, and based on techno-\neconomic analysis recommend the required rehabilitation option for each GENCO plant. MOWP \nis preparing a detailed investment plan based on the results of this assessment. A project \nfeasibility study will be prepared, and the Government is expected to submit the PFR for the first \npower generation upgrade subproject in October 2010. A subsequent PFR is expected in 2012.  \n \n68.  Tranche 4. The tranche is expected to finance a gas compressor upgrade project. The \ncurrent installed capacity of compressor stations in northern Pakistan is approximately 200,000 \nhorsepower (hp), based on 1,100\u20133,830 hp gas turbines driving centrifugal compressors. The \ngas  consumed  in  these  compressors  is  considered  a  technical  loss.  In  addition,  the \ncompressors  incur  high  maintenance  costs  and  have  low  availability  due  to  frequent \nbreakdowns. The net efficiency of the compressors in the system has improved significantly with \nthe  installation  of  new  compressors.  The  project  will  replace  existing  stock  of  inefficient \ncompressor units and bring the total compression capacity up to 227,500 hp.  \n \n69.  Subsequent  tranche  projects  for  (i)  scaled-up  industrial  energy  efficiency  financing, \n(ii) energy efficiency retrofitting programs in the public and commercial sectors, (iii) gas and \nelectric appliance appliances, and (iv) private thermal power generation efficiency rehabilitation \nwill be identified and prepared based on the selection criteria. The amount of ADB financing \napproved under the MFF may be converted into instruments like guarantees for such activities \nas ADB considers necessary and appropriate in line with ADB's policies. \n  \nC.  Special Features \n \n70.    The Investment Program is the first effort in Pakistan to integrate energy security and \nclimate  change  into  a  common  strategic  platform.  It  underpins  a  reform  strategy  that  will \nmainstream energy efficiency and clean technology deployment into national planning and \npublic investments. Specific actions will go beyond just energy conservation (i.e., switching off \nlights).  The  Investment  Program  will  strengthen  regulatory  and  institutional  frameworks, \nestablish fiscal and financial incentives, and enforce standards and testing. It builds on ADB\u2019s \nongoing work to establish an integrated energy planning model. It strengthens capacity among \nkey  participants,  particularly  in  policy  planning,  gender  mainstreaming,  investment,  and \nmonitoring and evaluation. \n \n71.  The  Investment  Program  will  break  down  the  financial  barriers  to  clean  energy \ninvestments,  and  finance  deployment  of  clean  technology  that  has  been  successfully \ndemonstrated. The private sector will play a key part in the deployment of clean technology and \n ", "   15\nenergy services, and will be a direct beneficiary (on the supply and demand sides). Energy \nsavings will lower production costs and increase competitiveness. Energy efficiency will also \ncreate new business opportunities. Private energy service companies will be supported through \ntechnical and financial support. Public\u2013private partnerships will also emerge under the power \ngeneration component. In addition, the investments under the MFF are closely linked and \ncomplemented by interventions of other international financial institutions and bilateral agencies; \nand MFF will leverage commercial financing in energy efficiency and help build clean energy \nportfolios of commercial banks. These investments have low risks and robust paybacks. \n \n72.  The Investment Program thus sets out a framework for effective partnership with third \nparties\u2014investors and financiers\u2014over the medium term. Besides AFD, other development \npartners  may  determine  to  complement  ADB's  financing  after  the  Board's  approval  of  the \nproposed MFF through cofinancing to be administered by ADB. The amounts of cofinancing to \nbe provided by such other development partners and administered by ADB will be deducted \nfrom the total MFF amount. Such cofinancing may be provided as loans or grants, and may take \nthe form of parallel or joint cofinancing. ADB's administration of such cofinancing from time to \ntime will be reported to the Board for information annually.19 \n \nD.  Investment and Financing Plan \n \n73.

ADB  will  provide  up  to  $760,000,000  equivalent  from  its \nordinary capital resources under ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending \nfacility. At the request of the Government and if ADB considers appropriate, the aforesaid \namount  may  be  converted  into  guarantees,  cofinancing  administered  by  ADB,  and  other \ninstruments in accordance with ADB's then prevailing polices, rules and procedures. ADB will \nalso provide $20,000,000 equivalent from its Special Funds resources. \n \n                                                 \n19 ADB. 2008.

AFD will provide cofinancing of up to \u20ac150 million, and the Government will finance the \nremaining $200 million equivalent. Conditions and arrangements for AFD cofinancing will be \nseparately agreed between the Government and AFD. For each tranche under the MFF, ADB \nand AFD will enter into a cofinancing agreement in order for ADB to handle AFD's cofinancing \non a partial-administration basis. The items to be jointly cofinanced by AFD under each tranche \nwill be based on the related financing plan as agreed among the Government, AFD and ADB. \n \n76.  Tranche 1. ADB financing under the first tranche will be provided from ordinary capital \nresources ($40 million) and Special Funds resources ($20 million equivalent). The ordinary capital \nresources loan will have a 15-year term, including a grace period of 5 years, an interest rate \ndetermined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending \nfacility, a commitment charge of 0.15% per annum, and such other terms and conditions set forth \nin the draft loan agreement. The Special Funds resources loan will have a term of 32 years, \nincluding a grace period of 8 years with an interest charge of 1% per annum during the grace \nperiod  and  1.5%  per  annum  thereafter.  AFD  will  jointly  cofinance  a  loan  (\u20ac20  million)  in \naccordance with the terms and conditions agreed between the Government and AFD. The cost \nestimates and financing plan for tranche 1 are in Table 5.

The PMO will support the Office of the Member (Energy), Planning \nCommission and the concerned agencies for the implementation of (i) the road map\u2014policy, \nplanning, interagency and development partner cooperation, and capacity building support; and \n(ii) the Investment Program\u2014reporting, monitoring, selection and preparation of investment \nprojects,  and  consultant  support.  The  PMO  will  be  sufficiently  staffed  under,  and  obtain \nresources from, the Investment Program Management Support Project. A highly qualified and \nexperienced  program  director  with  energy  sector  expertise  will  lead  the  PMO.  The  PMO \n ", "   17\nstructure  will  comprise  the  following  core  teams:  technical;  legal;  safeguards;  gender \nmainstreaming; and monitoring, evaluation, and reporting. The PMO will inform the EECCG on \nthe road map and implementation progress of the Investment Program. It will facilitate EECCG \nmeetings. Details on the implementation arrangements are in Appendix 7.  \n \n2.  Tranche 1 Project Management \n79.  National  CFL  Project. MOWP  will be the Executing Agency. It has delegated the \nPakistan  Electric  Power  Company  (PEPCO)  to  carry  out  procurement.  Eight  DISCOs  and \nKarachi Electric Supply Company will help implement this project in their respective license \nareas. Detailed implementation arrangements are in Appendix 4. \n \n80.  PEPCO will (i) carry out bulk procurement of CFLs on behalf of MOWP; (ii) organize a \npublic awareness campaign; and (iii) coordinate and monitor project implementation activities. \nThe DISCOs and Karachi Electric Supply Company will be responsible for, among others, (i) \ntransportation and delivery of CFLs to all eligible households; and (ii) collection and disposal of \nall incandescent bulbs replaced. \n \n81.  The project management units (PMUs) established in PEPCO and eight DISCOs under \nthe ADB-assisted Power Distribution Enhancement Investment Program20 will also be made \nresponsible  for  assisting  with  implementing  this  project.  These  PMUs  will  coordinate  and \nmanage their respective project activities and liaise with MOWP and project consultants.  \n \n82.  Investment Program Management Support Project. The Planning Commission, as \nExecuting Agency for the Investment Program, will be responsible for this Project. It will recruit \nconsultants to support sector agencies to prepare projects to be financed under the MFF. \nExternal expertise will be provided to support the PMO in implementing the road map actions \nand adopting best practices in project and policy development, as well as human resource \ndevelopment and training. \n \n3.  Implementation Period  \n83.  The Investment Program will be implemented over 10 years; it may be completed earlier. \nImplementation of each tranche is expected to require from 2 to 5 years. The last PFR should be \nsubmitted not later than the end of 2014. The MFF implementation schedule is in Appendix 7.  \n \n84.  Tranche 1 will be implemented as follows: \n \n(i)  The National CFL Project will be implemented by 31 January 2012.  \n(ii)  The Investment Program Management Support Project will be implemented by 30 \nSeptember 2016.  \n \n4.  Advance Contracting and Retroactive Financing \n85.  The Government has requested ADB approval of advance procurement of works, goods, \nand consultants. Advance procurement actions will apply for all tranches. The Government \nrequested retroactive financing of up to 20% of each loan amount. The Government has been \ninformed that approval of advance contracting and retroactive financing does not commit ADB to \nfinance any of the proposed projects. \n                                                 \n20  ADB. 2008. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Multitranche \nFinancing Facility to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan for the Power Distribution Enhancement Investment Program. \nManila. \n ", "18    \n \n5.  Procurement  \n86.  International competitive bidding is the preferred method or procurement, and will be \nused for goods contracts estimated to cost the equivalent of $1 million or more, and for works \ncontracts estimated to cost the equivalent of $5 million or more. National competitive bidding will \nbe used for goods contracts estimated to cost less than $1 million, and for works contracts \nestimated to cost less than $5 million. A procurement plan is in Appendix 8. Procurement plans \nfor subsequent tranches may include other modes of procurement, in line with the nature of the \nproject.  \n \n87.  All procurement will be carried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines \n(2007, as amended from time to time). The procedures for national competitive bidding are the \nPublic Procurement Rules, 2004.21 These comply with ADB rules. \n \n88.  Consulting services will be engaged using quality- and cost-based selection. Individual \nconsultants will be recruited in accordance with government procedures acceptable to ADB. Other \nmodes of selection of firms may be used for subsequent tranches in line with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on \nthe Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time), depending on the circumstances of \nthe project. \n  \n89.  Project implementation consultants engaged under the Power Distribution Enhancement \nInvestment Program (footnote 20) will be asked to support implementation of the CFL project. \n \n6.  Anticorruption Policy \n90.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the Government, executing and implementing agencies. Consistent with its commitment to \ngood  governance,  accountability,  and  transparency,  ADB  reserves  the  right  to  investigate, \ndirectly or through its agents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices \nrelating to the Investment Program. To support these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s \nAnticorruption Policy are included in the loan regulations and the bidding documents for the \nInvestment  Program.  In  particular,  all  contracts  financed  by  ADB  in  connection  with  the \nInvestment Program shall include provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and examine \nthe  records  and  accounts  of  the  executing  agencies;  implementing  agencies;  and  all \ncontractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service providers as they relate to the Investment \nProgram. ADB retains the right to suspend or cancel the entire Investment Program in case of \nproven wrongdoing. \n \n7.  Disbursement  \n91.  All loan disbursements will be conducted in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement \nHandbook (2007, as amended from time to time). Under tranche 1, imprest accounts will be \nestablished for the Planning Commission and MOWP. The total advance amount to be deposited \ninto the imprest accounts will not exceed the lower of (i) the estimated ADB share of eligible \nexpenditures  to  be  financed  through  the  relevant  imprest  account  for  6  months,  or  (ii)  the \nequivalent of 10% of the relevant loan amount. Statement of expenditure procedure will be used \nto reimburse eligible expenditures and to liquidate advances provided into the relevant imprest \naccounts for any individual payment not exceeding $100,000.   \n                                                 \n21  SRO 432 (1)/2004 issued on 9 June 2004 by the Public Procurement Regulatory Authority Ordinance 2002 (XXII of \n2002). \n ", "   19\n \n8.  Auditing, and Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n92.  The  FFA,  loan  agreements,  and  facility  administration  manual  describe  ADB \nrequirements  for  accounting,  auditing,  reporting,  monitoring,  and  evaluation.  These \nrequirements  were  thoroughly  discussed  and  agreed  with  the  Government,  executing  and \nimplementing agencies. \n \n9.  Governance  \n93.  The MFF-financed projects will be primarily implemented by agencies and utilities with \nwhich ADB has prior and ongoing client relations. Specific governance undertakings are given in \nthe FFA. ADB will assess the financial management, corporate governance, and procurement \ncapacity of each entity. Measurable performance indicators will be agreed for each project to be \nfinanced under the Investment Program, and will be monitored. The results framework will \ncapture these indicators. Advisory services will assist project entities to monitor, evaluate, and \nreport  against  these  indicators.  Future  tranche  project  due  diligence  will  comprise  a \ncomprehensive risk assessment for each project entity and incorporate appropriate governance \nmeasures.   \n \n94.  The Investment Program is the continuation of ADB support for energy reforms and \nrestructuring, and the creation of a commercially oriented corporate culture in sector companies. \nThe capacity development activities will support organizational and governance efforts; will \nenhance the capacity of utilities to manage both physical and financial activities; and provide \nmanagement and financial reporting to meet the accounting, asset management, and reporting \nrequirements  of  the  Government  and  ADB.  Use  of  ADB  guidelines  for  procurement  and \nconsulting  services  and  standard  bidding  documents  will  ensure  better  monitoring.  Bid \nspecifications and packaging will allow maximum competition. \n \n95.  Recruitment  of  financial  management  experts  and  establishment  of  internal  control \nsystems supported with advanced information and communication technology-based financial \nmanagement systems will ensure efficiency and accountability. External auditors will audit the \nfinancial  statements,  which  will  be  published  regularly  and  reported  to  the  public  and \nshareholders. ADB will have regular access to the accounting and controls systems of project \nentities (implementing agencies) to monitor expenditures and other financial transactions, and \nensure safe custody of project-financed assets.  \n \nIV.  INVESTMENT PROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \nA.  Benefits and Beneficiaries  \n1.  Macroeconomic Benefits \n96.  Long-term  economy  wide  benefits  include  annual  savings  of  $4  billion  by  FY2019, \ncorresponding to 3% of GDP.22 Presently, oil accounts for 31% of total energy consumption in the \ncountry, 84% of oil is imported. The country\u2019s oil import bill was $12 billion in FY2008 (7.5% of \nGDP). High dependence on oil imports results in a suboptimal energy supply mix, as oil is the \nmost expensive nonrenewable fossil energy source. The proportion of oil in the energy mix is \nprojected to increase to 36% by FY2019. Realization of the energy savings potential in the \neconomy  will  result  in  a  14%  decrease  in  the  projected  energy  deficit  by  FY2019,  with  a \n                                                 \n22 Assuming average annual GDP growth rate of 5.5%. \n ", "20    \ncorresponding reduction of 22% in the projected oil import bill.23 This will improve the country\u2019s \nbalance of payments. In the long term this will help optimize the energy mix, secure reliable \nenergy supply, and reduce consumption costs, which will lead to social and economic benefits \nand improved economic conditions. \n \n97.  While the Government hopes to balance power demand and supply by FY2012, it needs to \ninvest a significant amount to enhance power generation capacity, and the transmission and \ndistribution system. By saving 2,670 GWh on the demand side, the Investment Program will ensure \nthat the Government\u2019s targets are met in the most cost-effective and sustainable manner.  \n \n98.  Energy deficits can cause social unrest and political instability, resulting in reactionary, \nshort-term policy responses, such as high-cost and inefficient rental power capacities. Such \nmeasures have long-term implications for the economy. A rational approach is to opt for energy \nefficiency and allocation of energy to productive sectors, and to add supply-side capacities, \nwhich are least cost and bring in long-term benefits.  \n \n99.  Electricity is largely being consumed in the domestic and industry sectors and is not a \nmajor energy source for the agriculture and transport sectors. While domestic electricity consumers \nhave  some  degree  of  flexibility  in  coping  with  power  shortages,  industry  is  forced  to  curtail \nproduction in the short term. The long-term response of manufacturing to power shortages is to \ninvest in captive power generation, which draws on the scarce capital and management resources \nof the sector. Reliable energy supply through the Investment Program, specifically the industrial \nefficiency component, will help increase industrial output in the near term. \n \n2.  Increased Competitiveness  \n100.  The Investment Program will facilitate a viable energy services industry, and affect \nmarket transformation in favor of energy-efficient and environmentally sustainable products and \nservices. The electricity and gas saved would be available for uses that are more productive, \nwill increase utility revenues by redirecting sale to higher-tariff consumers, and reduce the need \nfor lifeline subsidies. The Investment Program will help the Government move toward attaining \nits stated policy objectives of achieving energy efficiency and energy security. \n \n101.  Energy efficiency in industries will reduce the sector\u2019s energy bill, and thereby lower \nproduction costs of goods and services for the efficient segments. This will induce competition \nwithin the industry, promote efficiency in the long term, and lead to a transformation of the \nsector toward lower energy intensity. Simultaneously, increased demand for efficient appliances \nand equipment will induce competition in the suppliers\u2019 market, promoting skill and technological \ndevelopment for local manufacturers as well. Lower production costs, through reduced energy \nbills for energy-intensive industries, will help establish competitive markets. The Investment \nProgram will facilitate a viable energy efficiency audit and management industry, and affect \nmarket transformation in favor of energy and environmentally efficient products and services. \n \n3.  Gender Impacts \n102.  The Investment Program will benefit women. For the poorest households (especially \nthose headed by women), the unavailability of energy is experienced as a driver of social \ninequality and vulnerability. Gender aspects will be mainstreamed in the energy policy. The \nphysical investments will increase energy access and quality of service. Energy efficiency can \n                                                 \n23 Developed using crude oil price of $50/barrel. \n ", "   21\nstrengthen women\u2019s role in society. Reduced energy bills will increase the disposable incomes \nof households, which will improve social welfare and bring relief to women who have to run their \nhouseholds on limited budgets, particularly among the middle- and lower-income groups. The \ndomestic  gas  appliance  replacement  program  will  introduce  efficient  cooking  and  heating \ndevices, which will help build awareness of energy efficiency, particularly among women.  \n \n4.  Environmental Benefits \n103.  The  Investment  Program  will  result  in  a  range  of  environmental  benefits.  Energy \nefficiency leads to a cleaner and better environment. About 1 million tons of CO  emission \n2\nreductions  will  be  realized  annually  beginning  in  2010.  In  Pakistan,  power  generation, \nparticularly from fossil fuels, has negative environmental impacts, which will be mitigated by end \nusers  saving  electricity  and  increasing  generation  efficiency. Emissions  of  atmospheric \npollutants from industrial plants will result in cleaner air.  The natural gas saved will displace \nheavy fuel oil in power generation and industry, which will help improve air quality through lower \nsulfur and particulate emissions. The construction of a lamp waste management facility will \nlower health risks associated with residual mercury from the expanding CFL market. \n \nB.  Technical Aspects \n104.  The  Investment  Program  will  accelerate  the  deployment  of  clean  technologies  and \ninitiate actions that will help realize energy savings potential in the country. Reduced electricity \nuse in the industry, residential, and public sectors of 2,670 GWh per year amounts to 3.6% of the \ncountry\u2019s  73,400  GWh  of  electricity  consumption.  The  corresponding  peak  load  reduction  of  \n1,094 MW amounts to 8% of the country\u2019s available generation capacity of 14,000 MW. Reduced \ntransformation and supply losses of 601,671 toe (26,595 TJ) per year in gas transmission and \nthermal power generation represent 1.3% of the country\u2019s total oil and gas consumption in FY2008. \nReduced gas, oil, and coal use in the residential and industry sectors amounting to 918,942 toe \n(40,619 TJ) per year, represent savings of 2% of the country\u2019s current total energy consumption.  \n \n105.  CFL  Project.  Grid-connected  households  have  42  million  light  points  fitted  with \nincandescent bulbs. The project will replace 10 million incandescent bulbs in 2010 (phase 1) \nand 20 million in 2011 (phase 2). The maximum peak load from incandescent bulbs is estimated \nto be 3,166 MW in the country. Peak demand will be reduced by about 1,094 MW (at 66% peak \ncoincidence),  resulting  in  savings  of  2,132  GWh/year  valued  at  $177  million.  Considering \nupstream losses and reserve margin requirements, the CFL project is therefore capable of \navoiding $1.84 billion in investments for 1,600 MW in new installed peak generation capacity \nthat would otherwise be required by 2011. \n \n106.  A lighting baseline survey in April 2009 found that 37 million incandescent bulb light \npoints in the 40\u2013100 W range contribute at least 2,028 MW to the system peak. Incandescent \nbulbs in households are consuming as much as 4,140 GWh annually. Average daily load curves \nshow peak demand on the power grid starting at 5:00 p.m. in the winter and 8:00 p.m. in the \nsummer, and lasting approximately 5 hours in both cases. Household lighting represents 15% of \nthis evening peak.  \n \n107.  An impact evaluation exercise will be conducted. It will assess the project impact on \nhousehold energy consumption and bills. The results and lessons will be incorporated in the \nsucceeding  implementation.  They  will  also  be  beneficial  to  other  similar  projects  in  ADB's \ndeveloping member countries. Further evaluation will be done over time with future tranches. \nThe results and lessons will be incorporated into the design of each operation. \n ", "22    \n \nC.  Financial Aspects \n108.  A  financial  management  assessment  of  proposed  project  entities  was  undertaken \n(Supplementary Appendix G). They meet ADB\u2019s minimum standards. \n \n109.  A  financial  analysis  of  the  CFL  project  was  carried  out  following  ADB  guidelines \n(Appendix 9). Financial viability was gauged by comparing incremental costs and benefits of \n\u201cwith-project\u201d and \u201cwithout-project\u201d scenarios. All financial costs and benefits are expressed at \nconstant 2009 prices. Cost streams were used to determine the financial internal rate of return. \nThe current generation tariff (February 2009) was used to calculate savings resulting from less \nelectricity sold at below-cost rates to subsidized low-income customers, and the benefit gained \nby selling energy saved to retail customers above cost (in accordance with the overall customer \nsales  profile).  A  combined  preliminary  financial  internal  rate  of  return  estimate  of  97%  is \nrecorded.  \n \nD.  Economic Analysis \n110.  The  projects  to  be  financed  under  the  Investment  Program  are  part  of  Pakistan\u2019s \nintegrated energy efficiency investment plan. They constitute a key component of the planned \nmarket transformation and deployment of energy-efficient technologies. The economic internal \nrate of return (EIRR) for the projects was determined assuming an economic discount rate of \n12%, exchange rate of PRs 80 = $1, and an oil price of $50 per barrel. Society\u2019s willingness to \npay was taken as the economic price of electricity, and is calculated at PRs 6.06 per kilowatt-\nhour. Natural gas is priced at the economic price of imported liquefied natural gas for the \ndomestic and commercial sectors, and at fuel oil prices for the industry sector. The border \nprices of petroleum products in the country are linked directly to international crude oil prices. \nThe market price of indigenous and imported coal is adjusted for sales tax to arrive at the \neconomic price of coal. The total program cost is estimated at $1,180 million. After valuing \nenergy  benefits  at  their  economic  price,  the  aggregated  EIRR  for  the  six  components  is \nestimated to be 66%. A summary of the economic analysis is provided in Appendix 10.  \n \n111.  The EIRR of the CFL project is calculated at 145%, reflective of the relatively short \nperiod in which investment in a CFL can be recovered. \n \n112.  Sensitivity of project economics to changes in key variables was tested. The EIRR is \nobserved to be sensitive to the variables evaluated, but exceeds the economic hurdle rate for all \nsensitivities tested, including the multiple downside (combined) scenario. On this basis, the \nprojects appear to be economically viable.  \n  \nE.  Environmental Aspects \n113.  The Investment Program\u2019s environmental and social safeguards evaluation is in Appendix \n11. An environmental assessment and review framework is in place (Supplementary Appendix H). \nIt  complies  with  the  Pakistan  Environmental  Protection  Act,  1997,  and  associated  rules, \nregulations, and guidelines; and is in conformity with ADB\u2019s Environment Policy (2002) and \nEnvironmental Assessment Guidelines (2003). The CFL project falls under category B and a \nsummary  initial  environmental  examination  is  included  in  Supplementary  Appendix  I.  No \nsignificant adverse impact is expected. No activities are planned in an environmentally sensitive or \nprotected areas. Provision for lamp waste management capacities is included in the Investment \nProgram Management Support Project. \n ", "   23\n \n114.  Environmental  assessment  for  investments  packaged  under  future  tranches  will  be \nconducted within the agreed framework and ADB rules.  \n \nF.  Clean Development Mechanism Aspects \n115.  The Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), established under the Kyoto Protocol and \nmanaged  by  the  United  Nations  Framework  Convention  on  Climate  Change,  will  provide \nadditional financing to support the development of energy-efficient projects. The projects under \nthe Investment Program are likely to be eligible for carbon financing. CDM assessment details \nare in Supplementary Appendix J. \n \n116.  Estimates  of  carbon  emission  reduction  potential  are  based  on  available  CDM \nmethodology.  Emission  reduction  under  the  CFL  project  is  estimated  at  approximately \n1,260,000 tons of CO  equivalent (tCO e) up to 2012. At a conservative price of $10 per tCO e, \n2 2 2\nthis could generate revenues of about $12.6 million for the CFL project up to 2012. ADB\u2019s Asia \nPacific Carbon Fund could purchase up to 50% of certified emission reductions up front. \n \n117.  After 2012, emission reduction is estimated at approximately 4,100,000 tCO e, which \n2\nmay amount to about $20.5 million (assuming a conservative price of $5 per tCO e). This could \n2\nbe purchased by ADB\u2019s Future Carbon Fund.  \n\u00a0\nG.  Social Safeguards \n118.  The CFL project does not entail land acquisition or economic or physical resettlement. \nTherefore, ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy (1995) is not triggered nor it will be triggered \nin future tranches. No components of the present or future tranches are planned in tribal areas \nof the North-West Frontier Province, which has formally identified indigenous people. Therefore, \nthe Investment Program will not trigger ADB\u2019s Policy on Indigenous Peoples (1998). \n \nH.  Poverty and Social Assessment \n119.  The energy savings will contribute to increased and reliable energy supply to various \nsectors.  Poor  and  marginalized  populations  are  often  among  the  hardest  hit  by  energy \nshortages. The load-shedding resorted to by electrical utilities is far greater in rural areas. \nAccess to and affordability of modern energy services is also the lowest among the poor. These \npopulation segments are therefore expected to benefit from the energy savings, both in terms of \nassociated costs as well as excess supplies made available to service their requirements.  \n \n120.  The CFL project is designed to benefit households by providing them with CFLs at the \ncost of incandescent bulb replacement. This will reduce their monthly energy bills. Similar \nbenefits will accrue from replacement of domestic gas appliances, including water heaters, \nspace heaters, and gas stoves.  \n \n121.  The expected twofold increase in the use of CFLs by low-income (lifeline) customers will \nresult in lower monthly electricity bills over the 7.8-year expected lamp lifetime. For end-user \nhouseholds, as much as $803 million could be saved in electricity use over the life of the  \n30 million CFLs. This translates to an average of PRs293 in annual electricity cost savings per \nincandescent bulb\u2013CFL replacement for each household. The summary poverty reduction and \nsocial strategy is in Appendix 12. \n \n ", "24    \n122.  In addition, poor households will learn about other affordable energy-efficient choices for \nreducing household energy bills through awareness building. Improved electricity supplies to the \npoor will directly contribute to increased economic opportunities and social service delivery to \nthem. More reliable energy supplies and the resulting sustained economic activity, in particular \nin the industry sector, will generate indirect benefits in terms of employment and increased labor \nproductivity and incomes. \n \n123.  Reduced energy demand resulting from efficient energy use across the economy will \nreduce the large financial outlays that would otherwise be required for developing additional \nenergy capacity and related infrastructure in the future, thereby saving public funds that could, \ninstead,  be  directed  toward  much-needed  social  development  requirements.  A  secure  and \npredictable electricity supply will lead to social and economic benefits; and improved conditions \nfor schools, hospitals, and other social services. \n \nI.  Gender Aspects \n124.  The Investment Program will support gender mainstreaming into the integrated energy \npolicy. The road map provides specific measures to allow the needs of both men and women to \nbe considered in all planning and policy making. For the most part, policy makers in Pakistan do \nnot take into account the differences between men and women relating to distribution of, and \ndecision making over, energy services. As a result, policies generally do not recognize a gender \nbias  in  energy  services,  and  women\u2019s  energy  needs  tend  to  be  marginalized  in  policy \ndocuments. \n \n125.  Policy  makers  need  to  become  aware  that  gender-neutral  energy  planning  misses \nimportant issues and inadvertently discriminates, usually against women. A gender-sensitive \nenergy policy would recognize that women and men have different energy needs due to their \ndiffering household roles, response to crises, and coping mechanisms; and would offer energy \ntechnologies and services that match those needs.  \n \n126.  A gender-sensitive energy policy involves more than the creation of a gender-sensitive \nset of energy-related goals. The actual process of policy formulation and implementation needs \nto be gender-sensitive. In Pakistan, the energy sector is male-dominated, particularly in the \nprofessional posts; as a result, issues identified and solutions offered often have a male bias. \nIncreased participation of women in the sector and improvement of their status relative to men \ncan help to incorporate gender as an integral part of energy policies and practices, although it \nwill  not  guarantee  the  adoption  of  gender-sensitive  policy  goals.  Engagement  of  women\u2019s \ngroups may be important for incorporating gender issues into energy policies. A shift to a \ndemand-side approach, which looks at energy as an aspect of the social and cultural setting, \n(rather  than  the  traditional  supply-side  approach,  which  focuses  primarily  on  technological \nsolutions) would contribute to more effectively addressing gender-related energy needs. \n \nJ.  Risks and Assumptions \n127.  Lack  of  progress  with  reforms,  a  deterioration  in  the  macroeconomic  situation, \nweaknesses in financial management, and institutional ineffectiveness are potential macro risk \nfactors. These are mitigated by a commitment of the present Government to continue with \nreforms, the economic stabilization program supported by the International Monetary Fund, and \nongoing  and  planned  measures  to  improve  transparency  and  accountability  of  financial \nmanagement systems. \n \n ", "   25\n128.  The key assumption made in designing the Investment Program is that the Government \nexecutes  the  energy  efficiency  sector  road  map,  successfully  combining  physical  and \nnonphysical investments. \n \n129.  Technical risks for energy efficiency projects are assessed as relatively low. However, \nsuch projects can be successful only if the underlying incentives of the regulatory framework are \nin place and correct. For this, the political commitment and policy framework are critical. \n \n130.  The  Investment  Program  needs  good  institutions  and  strong  management  and \ngovernance.  Good  planning,  best  practice  concepts,  sound  project  management,  fiduciary \noversight,  and  transparent  bidding  and  contract  management  processes  require  not  only \nexperienced personnel, but also efficient and effective systems, procedures, and controls. On \nthe institutional front, considerable hope is placed on the Planning Commission's ability to \nmanage the road map and the Investment Program. At the project level, utilities need to have \nadequate capacity to  manage the investments. Project management capacity of utilities is \naddressed under other ADB interventions, and the Investment Program will provide required \nadvisory services to prepare and implement specific projects. \n \n131.  The Planning Commission will be responsible for implementing the energy-efficiency \npolicy  and  associated  investment  projects.  A  dedicated  PMO  will  support  the  Planning \nCommission. The functions and facilities of the National Energy Conservation Centre will be \nrealigned  into  the  Planning  Commission.  Stakeholder  consultations  will  be  done  at  the \nGovernment\u2019s EECCG.  \n \n132.  A  risk  management  framework  will  be  prepared  for  each  project.  Projects  will  be \nsubjected to project readiness filters. Simple project designs will be conscientiously applied, and \nactive due diligence will help avoid quality gaps and start-up delays. Contracts will be bundled \ninto large packages. ADB will monitor the program through the Pakistan Resident Mission, with \nsupport from the energy team at ADB headquarters. \n \n133.  The CFL project has some risks: (i) timely procurement of CFLs and their distribution \nwithout any leakage to the commercial market; (ii) capacity of DISCOs to undertake timely \ndistribution of CFLs, and (iii) the Government\u2019s ability to implement and enforce strict controls \non energy-efficiency testing and labeling of CFLs.  \n \n134.  These risks will be mitigated by ensuring (i) the use of international energy performance \nstandards and international competitive bidding for the bulk procurement of CFLs; (ii) that \ndistribution of CFLs to customers is done at customer homes; (iii) that each CFL will be clearly \nmarked \u201cnot for sale;\u201d and (iv) that suppliers deliver the CFLs directly to the DISCO distribution \npoints. Customers will receive voucher(s) as part of their electricity bill and be made aware of \nthe free distribution via saturation media communication and social mobilization campaign.  \n \n135.  Appropriate monitoring mechanisms for effective distribution and reporting of the CFL \nlogistics  and  transactions  will  be  developed.  All  relevant  stakeholders  will  be  invited  to \nparticipate  in  developing  the  proposed  CFL  and  voucher  distribution  mechanism.  The \nmechanism will be optimized during implementation of the first procurement and distribution \nphase. Lessons from the distribution of the first phase will be incorporated in the subsequent \nphase. \n \n ", "26    \nV.  ASSURANCES \n136.  In addition to the standard assurances, the Government has agreed to the following \nassurances, which have been largely incorporated into the FFA presented to the Board and will \nbe  incorporated,  as  appropriate,  into  the  legal  documents  for  projects  financed  under  the \nInvestment Program.  \n \n137.

Pakistan  is  experiencing  an  acute  energy  shortage  crisis  caused  by  (i) insufficient \nenergy supply capacity, (ii) poor sector performance, (iii) increasing demand, and (iv) inefficient \nuse of energy resources. The country needs to embark on a determined and sustained long-\nterm plan to optimize the energy mix and its use across all sectors of the economy.1  \n \n2.  Improving energy efficiency and energy productivity are key components of the energy \npolicy and energy security strategy of Pakistan. These will reduce unproductive and volatile \ndemand and result in energy savings. Lower energy intensity will boost energy access, help \nmeet national social development goals, and reduce environmental degradation and carbon \nemissions. An \u201cenergy-productive\u201d Pakistan will be more competitive in the global economy. \n \n3.  The Government of Pakistan is committed to resolving the energy crisis and achieving \nenergy  security  for  the  country.  This  will  require  sound  leadership, sustained  political  and \nfinancial commitment, and a clear vision and strategy from the Government for implementing \nand mainstreaming energy efficiency and energy conservation actions in all major energy-\nconsuming sectors and markets. The Government adopted the energy efficiency sector road \nmap and an associate investment program. The road map comprises a series of correlated and \nsequential policy, regulatory, and institutional measures and capital investments aimed to \n \n(i)  establish a dynamic business environment for the sustained transformation of the \nenergy efficiency market2 in Pakistan; and \n(ii)  scale up deployment of proven technologies through public investments in all \nmajor energy-consuming sectors and markets (industry, transportation, domestic \nand commercial buildings, and agriculture) as well as the energy supply chain \n(energy production, generation, transformation, transmission, and distribution). \n \n4.  The  road  map  (detailed  version  in  Supplementary  Appendix  K)  defines  the  overall \napproach, elements, impacts, and timelines necessary under which the respective roles of all \nrelevant stakeholders can be coordinated, sequenced, financed, implemented, and monitored. It \nis  complemented  by  the  Energy  Efficiency  Sector  Investment  Program,  which  presents  a \nquantitative assessment of the national energy efficiency savings potential and investment \nrequirements, economic benefit analysis, and detailed project and activity design and costing. \nThe Investment Program is the first such comprehensive analysis of the energy efficiency and \nenergy productivity improvements that are based on existing technologies. The Investment \nProgram is presented in Supplementary Appendix D.  \n \n                                                 \n1\n Growing energy needs, coupled with insufficient supply and transformation capacity, are leading to severe deficits \nof electricity and natural gas and escalating fuel imports. This seriously impedes economic activity and growth, and \nstrains the balance-of-payments position of the country. The majority of the population are being denied basic \nenergy services on a reliable and affordable basis, resulting in social disruption. \n2\n Pakistan has a large untapped energy efficiency market. Past efforts to mainstream and develop energy efficiency \nprojects have largely failed due to unavailability of financing. Expanding the energy efficiency market requires \npolicy and financial incentives, including demonstrable benefits and market prospects.  \n ", "34  Appendix 2 \n \nTable A2: Pakistan\u2019s Energy

The  initial  tranche  of  the  Energy  Efficiency  Investment  Program  will  involve  the \nreplacement of incandescent bulbs in 30 million residential light points with long-life, high-\nefficiency compact fluorescent lamps (CFLs) within the license areas of nine distribution utilities \nin Pakistan. The Government of Pakistan is sponsoring this project. It will be implemented jointly \nby the eight power distribution companies (DISCOs) and the Karachi Electric Supply Company \n(KESC) over 28 months with two procurement and distribution phases. The $85 million CFL \nproject will reduce peak demand by 1,094 megawatts (MW); avoid 1,602 MW in generating \ncapacity  additions,  corresponding  to  $1.84  billion  in  new  generation  investments;  save \n$800 million in household electricity expenses; result in 2,132 gigawatt-hours (GWh) of annual \nelectricity consumption reductions; avoid 7 million tons of carbon dioxide (CO ) emissions by the \n2\nend of 2018, and accelerate the transformation of the incandescent bulb market to high-quality \nCFLs.  The  $25  million  Investment  Program  Management  Support  Project  will  enable \nincandescent bulb phaseout, as well as build institutional capacities for the adoption of energy \nperformance standards, testing of CFLs and other appliances, and lamp waste management. \nA.   Background \n \n2.  Since 2006, electricity demand in Pakistan has greatly outstripped available generation \ncapacity. The resulting load shedding and power outages caused street protests in many cities \nin  early  2009.  Businesses  have  gone  on  strike  to  protest  the  worsening  electricity  supply \nproblem. In July 2009 the country faced power shortages of approximately 5,000 MW. Demand \nis expected to exceed supply by more than 5,500 MW in 2010. The present electricity supply \nshortfall, coupled with consistent growth in demand (7%\u20138% per annum), clearly indicates the \ncritical need for enhancing the country\u2019s current power generation capability as well as curtailing \nunnecessary consumption. \n3.  The August 2008 and January 2009 average daily load curves show peak demand \nstarting at 5:00 p.m. in winter and 8:00 p.m. in summer and lasting approximately 5 hours in \nboth cases (Figure A4.2). Household lighting represents a significant portion of this evening \npeak. An energy-efficient lighting project could have a significant impact on reducing the peak \nand avoiding load shedding. \n4.  International experience shows that among all potential energy efficiency projects, one \nof the most effective short-term approaches is the scaled-up replacement of incandescent bulbs \nwith CFLs in the residential sector. In the longer term, the project should seek to transform the \ndomestic  lighting  market  so  that  incandescent  bulbs  and  other  low-efficiency  lighting \ntechnologies are no longer used. \nB.   Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n \n5.  A baseline survey involving 3,253 domestic customers of eight DISCOs and KESC was \nperformed in April 2009 to support the design of this project (Supplementary Appendix L).1 \nUsing  the  domestic  customer  distribution  patterns  of  the  nine  utilities  across  the  different \nconsumption tiers, the survey estimates that the 37.1 million incandescent bulb light points in \nthe 40\u2013100 W range of domestic consumers contribute at least 2,028 MW to the system peak \nduring evening hours. These incandescent bulb light points in households are consuming as \nmuch as 3,952 GWh annually. \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2008. Technical Assistance to Pakistan for Preparing the Sustainable Energy Efficiency Development \nProgram. Manila (TA 7060-PAK). \n ", "Appendix 4   41\n6.  Table A4.1 shows that 76.9% of electrified households in Pakistan still have at least one \nincandescent bulb. The table also shows a significant market penetration of CFLs in this sector. \nTable A4.1: Household Penetration of Lighting Technologies \nLighting Technology  Household Penetration (%) \nIncandescent Bulb  76.9 \nCompact Fluorescent Lamp  63.9 \nFluorescent Tube Lamp  48.6 \nOther  3.6 \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n7.  Current CFL and incandescent bulb utilization varies by consumer category. As part of \nthe market survey, data was collected to verify customer choices of lighting technology. Data \nfrom  the  baseline  survey  illustrate  incandescent  bulb  and  CFL  use  across  five  monthly \nconsumption categories: (i) up to 50 kilowatt-hours (kWh), (ii) 51\u2013100 kWh, (iii) 101\u2013300 kWh, \n(iv) 301\u20131,000 kWh, and (v) above 1,000 kWh (Figure A4.1).  \nFigure A4.1: Incandescent Bulb and CFL Penetration in Pakistan  \nby Domestic Customer Category, 2009 \n100%\n48.8%\n48.0%\n80%\n27.9% 23.7% 5.9%\ns\nnt\noi 60%\np 63.6%\nht\ng\nLi\nof \nge  40% 45.1% 46.8%\na\nnt\ne\nPerc 34.0% 33.1% IB Utilization (Cumulative)\n20%\nCFL Utilization\n0%\nUpto 50  51-100 101-300 301-1,000 Above 1,000\nCustomer Category Based on kWh/Month Usage   \nCFL = compact fluorescent lamp, IB = incandescent bulb, kWh = kilowatt hour.  \nSources: Asian Development Bank and Pakistan Electric Power Company estimates. \n8.  Figure  A4.1  shows  that  consumers  with  lower  monthly  consumption  use  more \nincandescent bulbs. Alternatively, the lower the kWh usage, the lower the percentage of CFL \nlight points. In other words, lifeliners (customers using less than 50 kWh per month) have the \nhighest percentage of incandescent bulb incidence and use, while consumers with more than \n1,000 kWh use the lowest percentage. Thus, a CFL project will help proportionately more \ncustomers in the lower-income brackets to acquire energy-saving CFLs. \n9.  The project is designed to replace the maximum number of incandescent bulbs in the \nresidential market by replacing 40 watt (W), 60 W, and 100 W incandescent bulbs with 20\u201323W \n ", "42  Appendix 4 \nCFLs.

As a contingency, remaining CFL quantities from phases 1 and 2 that are not disbursed \ncan be distributed through a possible third phase (with no additional CFL procurement), which \ncan include commercial and industrial buildings. Any remaining CFLs not distributed after that \ncan also be used to upgrade lighting in government buildings, or distributed to customers \nconnected to other bulk redistributors of electricity or to off-grid consumers. \nC.   Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n \n11.  The CFL project will contribute immensely to the Investment Program\u2019s objective of \nclosing the current energy demand and supply imbalance by reducing peak demand through the \nmassive  replacement  of  30  million  light  points  in  grid-connected  households  with  a  more \nenergy-efficient lighting technology. The bulk distribution of CFLs will defer new investments for \npeaking generating capacities, generate electricity savings, avoid CO  emissions, and advance \n2\nCFL market transformation in the domestic sector. The design and monitoring framework for the \nCFL project is in Appendix 1. \n12.  Peak Demand Reduction and Avoided Peak Generation Capacities. Average daily \nand hourly electricity demand in Pakistan varies by season. Lighting demand is affected by the \n ", "Appendix 4   43\ntime of sunset. With darkness coming earlier in the day during winter months, the evening \nlighting  load  is  higher  than  in  summer  months.  Mainly  due  to  lighting  load,  the  National \nTransmission  and  Despatch  Company\u2019s  system  peak  starts  at  around  8:00  p.m.  during \nsummers and 5:00 p.m. during winters. The peak lasts for an average of 5 hours in all seasons, \ncorresponding to the peak time of typical household activities. \n13.  To assess the impact of CFL replacement, data for two peak months was analyzed, with \nAugust representing the summer season and January representing winter. The average daily \nload curves for August 2008 and January 2009 were used. Based on these data, the average \npeak demand over the daily base demand is projected to be 2,468 MW during summer and \n2,027 MW during winter in FY2010, mainly contributed to by lighting loads. The projected peak \ndemand rise for FY2011 is 2,662 MW for the summer and 2,178 MW for the winter. \n14.  The domestic sector connected to the grid is estimated to have about 41.78 million light \npoints presently fitted with incandescent bulbs. Under this project, 10 million incandescent bulbs in \nthe 40\u2013100 W range will be replaced in 2010 (phase 1) and another 20 million in 2011 (phase 2). \nThe total peak demand of incandescent bulbs is estimated to be 3,166 MW in the country, across \nall  wattages  and  assuming  100%  peak  use  coincidence.  Conservatively,  this  reduces  to \n2,029 MW  for  incandescent  bulbs  in  the  40\u2013100  W  range,  at  66%  peak  coincidence.  The \nreplacement of 30 million incandescent bulbs with CFLs, having average consumption of 21.5 W \nper lamp, will result in an estimated reduction of peak demand by about 1,094 MW (at 66% peak \ncoincidence). The peak demand reduction is estimated to be 365 MW for phase 1 and 729 MW \nfor phase 2. This translates into a 53.9% peak demand reduction from the total incandescent bulb \nload of 2,028 MW after phase 2. Considering upstream losses and reserve margin requirements, \nthe project is capable of avoiding $1.84 billion in investments for 1,602 MW in new installed peak \ngeneration capacities. Figure A4.2 shows the impact of the CFL replacement project on the daily \npeak after phase 2. \nFigure A4.2: Impact of CFL Distribution on National Daily Load Curve \n25,000\n20,000\n15,000\nW\nM\n10,000\nAverage Daily Summer Load (NTDC, Including Export to KESC), August\nAverage Daily Winter Load (NTDC, Including Export to KESC), January\n5,000\nModified Average Daily Summer Load (NTDC, Including Export to KESC), August\nModified Average Daily Winter Load (NTDC, Including Export to KESC), January\n0\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24\nHours  \nCFL = compact fluorescent lamp, KESC = Karachi Electric Supply Corporation, MW = \nmegawatt, NTDC = National Transmission and Despatch Company. \nSources: Asian Development Bank (dashed curve) and NTDC (solid curve) estimates. \n ", "44  Appendix 4 \n \n15.  Annual Electricity Savings and Avoided CO  Emissions. The baseline survey shows \n2\nthat 1,094 MW of demand reduction resulting from 30 million incandescent bulb replacements in \nthe  40\u2013100  W  range  applied  through  surveyed  daily  duties  (varying  per  DISCO,  averaging \n3.69 hours/day) can yield annual savings amounting to 2,132 GWh per year. Using accepted \nPakistan electricity grid emission factors, this translates to annual CO  emissions of 7 million tons \n2\nof CO  equivalent (tCO e) through the estimated 7.78-year CFL life (or until 2018). As much as \n2 2\n$800 million could be saved by participating domestic customers over the life of the CFLs. This \ntranslates to an average PRs293 in annual electricity cost savings per incandescent bulb\u2013CFL \nreplacement. Furthermore, the CFL project is able to reduce cross-subsidies across domestic \nconsumption tiers by approximately $60 million annually. The project also allows the distribution \nutilities to sell the available electricity to higher-earning tariff tiers at a conservative minimum of \n$29 million per year. \n16.  Acceleration  of  CFL  Market  Transformation. Figures A4.3 and A4.4 illustrate the \nproject\u2019s impact on CFL uptake and market transformation. Figure A4.3 shows current CFL \nusage and incandescent bulb usage by customer class; and Figure A4.4 shows projected usage \nafter phase 2. Taken together, the curves show a gradual increase in CFL use by customers \nacross all consumption categories. For example, the use of CFLs by lifeliners (consumers using \nless than 50 kWh per month), expressed as a percentage of the total lighting points used, is \nexpected to increase from the current 34% of households to 74% after phase 2. \nFigure A4.3: Relative Penetration of Incandescent Bulbs and CFLs in Pakistan \nby Domestic Customer Categories in 2009 \n100%\nIB Utilization (Cumulative)\nCFL Utilization\n80%\n5.9%\ns\nnt\nhtpoi 60% 48.8% 48.0% 27.9% 23.7%\ng\nLi\nof \ne \ng 40%\na\nnt\ne\nc 63.6%\ner\nP\n45.1% 46.8%\n20%\n34.0% 33.1%\n0%\nUpto 50  51-100 101-300 301-1,000 Above 1,000\nCustomer Category Based on kWh/Month Usage \n \nCFL = compact fluorescent lamp, IB = incandescent bulb, kWh = kilowatt hour. \nSource: Asian Development Bank survey, April 2009. \n \n ", "Appendix 4   45\nFigure A4.4: Relative Penetration of Incandescent Bulbs and CFLs in Pakistan  \nby Domestic Customer Categories After Phase 2 \n100%\nIB Utilization (Cumulative)\nCFL Utilization\n80% 9%\n15%\n9% 4%\ns 12%\noint 60%\np\nht\ng\nLi\nof \nge  40%\na\nent 74% 66% 64% 59% 66%\nc\ner\nP\n20%\n0%\nUpto 50  51-100 101-300 301-1,000 Above 1,000\nCustomer Category Based on kWh/Month Usage \n \nCFL = compact fluorescent lamp, IB = incandescent bulb, kWh = kilowatt hour. \nSource: Asian Development Bank survey, April 2009. \n \n17.

Project Design Features \n \n18.  The  two  most  critical  features  of  the  CFL  project  design  are  (i)  the  technical \nspecifications  for  the  bulk  procurement  of  the  CFLs;  and,  (ii)  the  CFL  distribution  and \nincandescent bulb recovery mechanism.  \n19.  CFL Specifications. For the bulk procurement of 20\u201323 W CFLs, current efficient lighting \ninitiative (ELI) technical specifications will be adopted as the international energy performance \nstandard, with the exception of increasing the life rating of the procured CFLs from 6,000 hours to \n10,000 hours. As a result of the extended life rating, participating manufacturers will be required to \nextend the  warranty  on the product from 1  year  (as per  ELI requirement) to 2  years. The \nenhancement of the life specification is possible for three reasons: \n ", "46  Appendix 4 \n(i)  A 10,000-hour life specification allows project implementing entities to increase \nthe  CFL  warranty  period  to  24  months.  Public  perception  of  the  project  is \nenhanced through reduced complaints of defective CFLs during implementation. \n(ii)  The  10,000-hour  specification  increases  potential  Clean  Development \nMechanism (CDM) revenues by extending the crediting period of CER revenues \n(in this case it will be beyond 2012) to at least 7 years versus the typical 3\u20134 \nyears for 6,000-hour CFLs. \n(iii)  Longer-life CFLs reduce hazardous mercury waste by decreasing the frequency \nof CFL replacements at each light point. \n \n20.  The recommended minimum efficacy for the bulk-procured CFLs will also follow ELI \nstandards (57 lumens/W) for lamps rated 15 W and higher. The light output of a 1,350-lumen \n20\u201323 W CFL is expected to match or exceed the total rated luminous flux for a typical 100 W \nincandescent bulb in Pakistan (versus 1,240-lumen market average incandescent bulb luminous \nflux). \n21.  Based on the baseline household survey, approximately 90% of the incandescent bulbs \nin domestic light points are fitted with bayonet B22 caps (locally referred to as \u201cpin-type\u201d), while \nthe small balance of incandescent bulbs were fitted with Edison screw E27 (and E14) caps. To \naddress the broader and immediate incandescent bulb replacement needs of the domestic \nsector, CFLs to be procured for phase 1 will be fitted with B22 caps only. The feasibility of \nreplacing  E27-capped  incandescent  bulbs  (for  specific  high-incidence  areas,  such  as \nIslamabad) will be studied during the evaluation of phase 1. \n22.  Also, bulk-procured CFLs will continue to use the international voluntary minimum power \nfactor specification of 0.5, which is adopted by ELI, US Energy Star, EU Quality Charter for \nCFLs, and even the proposed Asia CFL Quality Charter. Completed CFL projects in other \ncountries show no clear evidence of adverse impacts of bulk distribution of normal power factor \n(i.e., at least 0.5 power factor) CFLs on utility operations. While agencies in at least two \ncountries are starting to require high-power factor CFLs for their programs, the minimal and still \nunverified benefits to the distribution system cannot justify the estimated 45% increase in CFL \nproduction cost to raise the power factor to 0.8\u20130.9. Furthermore, a fear is that high-power \nfactor CFLs will increase vulnerability to wide voltage variations, thereby reducing the CFL \ncapacity to optimize its rated life. Furthermore, CDM-approved small-scale methodology AMS-\nII.J does not require high-power factor CFLs. \n23.  CFL  Distribution  Mechanism.  The  CFL  project  is  aimed  at  the  replacement  of \n30 million incandescent bulbs in the 40\u2013100 W range with 20\u201323 W CFLs. If successful, the two \nphases of free CFL distribution will largely eliminate the use of incandescent bulbs from the \nresidential market. \n24.  The CFLs will be provided to domestic customers of eight DISCOs and KESC free-of-\ncharge over 2 years. Typically, CFL giveaway projects do not recover their costs directly. \nHowever, this project is projected to recover its costs through reduced subsidies to low-income \n\u201clifeline\u201d  customers.  The  higher  tariffs  paid  by  higher  electricity-consuming  households  to \nsupport low-income consumers, plus the direct government subsidies paid to support low-\nincome consumers, will together generate a revenue surplus because low-income consumers \nwill be consuming less electricity by using CFLs instead of incandescent bulbs. That surplus is \nprojected to cover the costs of the CFLs and project administration. Hence, the project, despite \npurchasing and giving away CFLs, will recover its costs in about a year. \n ", "Appendix 4   47\n25.  In general, demand-side management programs can be broadly divided into two types: \n\u201copt-out\u201d and \u201copt-in\u201d programs. In opt-out programs, the customer does not need to initiate a \ntransaction to participate in the program, while for opt-in programs the customer has to initiate a \ncertain activity in order to participate. The CFL project is the opt-out program type. Opt-out \nprograms typically have higher participation rates, a key factor for the swift creation of virtual \ngenerating capacities in the grid. Although opt-out programs are more costly and need more \ncoordination, the critical energy security objectives of the CFL project cannot afford the slower \nmarket response from a pure opt-in program. \n26.  PEPCO will handle activities related to the bulk procurement of the CFLs through the \ntwo phases on behalf of the Ministry of Water and Power, while the DISCOs and KESC express \nconfidence that, bolstered with supplemental logistics in isolated cases, they can handle the \ndistribution of the CFLs and the collection of incandescent bulbs and eligibility vouchers. Should \nsome of the DISCOs decide to subcontract the delivery to third-party service providers, the cost \nis  estimated  to  be  in the  range of  PRs30\u2013PRs40  per  delivered  CFL.  This  estimated  cost \nincludes the recovery and shipment of incandescent bulbs. \n27.  In either case, the DISCO remains the responsible party for distribution. Completed \nutility-led demand-side management programs in other countries demonstrate the advantages \nof enhancing the image of the utility with respect to its customers as well as optimizing program \nimpacts and sustainability by guarding the product from potential fraud or diversion to other \nmarket channels. \n28.  More specific features of the distribution mechanism include the following: \n(i)  PEPCO will coordinate the project and conduct a bulk purchase of CFLs that are \ncompliant with predetermined specifications. Bulk purchase of the CFLs will be \nperformed  in  two  phases,  the  first  for  10  million  CFLs  and  the  second  to \npurchase 20 million CFLs. This is to help lower the unit cost of the lamps. \n(ii)  PEPCO will distribute the CFLs to DISCOs and KESC. For each phase, PEPCO \nwill assign the quantity of CFLs to be delivered to each utility based on the \nrelative number of residential customers and the projected number of 40\u2013100 W \nincandescent bulb light points in each utility. A preliminary estimate of the CFL \nallocations and their corresponding peak reduction and energy saving impacts \nare in Table A4.4. \n(iii)  The DISCOs and KESC will mail or deliver the vouchers to all of their active \nresidential customers along with, and as a detachable portion of, the monthly \nutility bill. \n(iv)  The DISCOs and KESC will be responsible for distributing the CFLs to residential \ncustomers  door-to-door,  where  the  customer  will  trade  working  40\u2013100  W \nincandescent bulbs together with the previously mailed voucher with high-quality \nCFLs on a one-to-one swap basis. \n(v)  Depending on logistics and capacity of each utility, the DISCOs or KESC can \nchoose to use their own personnel or hire delivery subcontractors. \n(vi)  Recovered  incandescent  bulbs  will  be  collected  in  utility  sites  for  third-party \nverification before disposal and recycling. To prevent distribution of recovered \nincandescent bulbs back into the market, utility personnel should be required to \ndeform  the  metal  bayonet  cap  at  point-of-collection  with  special  care  not  to \ndamage the glass portion of the incandescent bulb. (The wattage marking on the \nglass portion provides future auditable basis of the baseline power rating of the \nincandescent bulb). After third party verification of incandescent bulb inventories, \n ", "48  Appendix 4 \nDISCOs and KESC may destroy the incandescent bulbs, send incandescent bulb \nwaste to existing material recyclers, and collect proceeds of the sale of scrap \nmaterials.  \n(vii)  The DISCOs and KESC will perform an analysis of the redeemed vouchers at the \nend of each phase. \n \nTable A4.4: Preliminary Estimates of CFL Allocations and \nPeak Demand and Electricity Savings by DISCO \nNo. of \nCFL Allocation (million)  Peak Demand  Annual Energy \nDomestic \nReduction  Savingsa \nCustomers \n(MW)  (GWh/year)  \n(million)  Phase 1  Phase 2  Total \nUtility \nLESCO  2.41  1.4  2.9  4.3  162.5  324.7 \nGEPCO  1.97  1.2  2.3  3.5  129.4  281.7 \nFESCO  2.33  1.4  2.8  4.2  115.8  211.2 \nIESCO  1.63  1.0  1.9  2.9  57.7  71.0 \nMEPCO  3.27  1.9  4.0  5.9  224.3  458.6 \nPESCO  2.10  1.3  2.5  3.8  175.2  325.2 \nHESCO  1.18  0.7  1.4  2.1  93.4  175.6 \nQESCO  0.36  0.2  0.4  0.6  28.4  53.8 \nKESC  1.50  0.9  1.8  2.7  107.2  229.9 \nTotal  16.75  10.0  20.0  30.0  1,093.9  2,131.6 \nCFL = compact fluorescent lamp, DISCO = distribution company, FESCO = Faisalabad Electric Supply Company, \nGEPCO  =  Gujranwala  Electric  Power  Company,  GWh  =  gigawatt-hour,  HESCO  =  Hyderabad  Electric  Supply \nCompany, IESCO = Islamabad Electric Supply Company, KESC = Karachi Electric Supply Corporation, LESCO = \nLahore Electric Supply Company, MEPCO = Multan Electric Power Company, MW = megawatt, PESCO = Peshawar \nElectric Supply Company, QESCO = Quetta Electric Supply Company. \na Energy savings are shown in terms of demand reduction; equivalent supply savings would be higher on account of \nT&D losses and reserve margin requirements. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n29.  Figure  A4.5  illustrates  the  general  distribution  mechanism  of  the  CFL  project.  This \ndistribution scheme,  devised  by  the  DISCOs  in  consultation  with  each  other  and  PEPCO, \noptimally utilizes their existing resources to minimize costs, while at the same time ensuring that \nnormal DISCO functions are not affected by the additional CFL distribution responsibilities. \n30.  The distribution mechanism calls for the supply of bulk consignments of CFLs allocated to \neach DISCO (Figure A4.5) in containers to designated regional storage points operated by the \nDISCO. The number of these main supply storages and the corresponding CFL allocations will be \nspecified  in  the  CFL  bidding  documents  and  determined  on  the  CDM  program  of  activity \nrequirements. From these storage sites, CFLs will be delivered on a daily basis to the respective \nDISCO\u2019s subdivision field stores, utilizing mini trucks specifically procured by the DISCOs for this \npurpose. Field distribution teams, each consisting of one DISCO employee and one contracted \nhire, will then be provided with batch customer address lists for door-to-door delivery of the CFLs \nin adjoining areas using motorbikes (with modified carrier boxes) purchased by the DISCOs for \neach team. The teams will exchange the CFLs for working incandescent bulbs (in the 40\u201360 W \nrange) and customer vouchers (provided with their electricity bills) on a one-to-one basis, and \nreturn the incandescent bulbs and vouchers collected through the subdivision collection points up \nto the regional storage sites. At this point, on a regular basis and in the presence of third-party \ninspectors, the incandescent bulb and voucher counts will be verified and the incandescent bulbs \ndestroyed. The collated vouchers will then be dispatched to the respective DISCO\u2019s customer \n ", "Appendix 4   49\ndata center for analysis. The DISCO\u2019s existing stores and inventory system will be utilized for \nmaintaining proper accounting of the transactions and material movements involved at all stages. \nFigure A4.5: CFL Distribution and Incandescent Bulb Recovery Scheme \n \nAFD = Agence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement, CDM = Clean Development Mechanism, CFL = \ncompact fluorescent lamp, DISCO = distribution company, IB = incandescent bulb, ICB = international \ncompetitive bidding, PEPCO = Pakistan Electric Power Company, PDD = project design document. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n31.

Additionally,  project  monitoring  and \nevaluation (M&E) consultants will be recruited by the program management office (PMO) to lead \nthe monitoring, verification, and evaluation of both project distribution phases. The CFL project \nM&E services will be supported by a separate M&E budget under the support component of the \nInvestment  Program.  An  estimated  8  person-months  of  an  international  consultant  and \n118 person-months of national consultants will be required to provide M&E services for both \nphases. All international and national consultants will be recruited in accordance with ADB \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). Outline terms of \nreference  for  the  implementation  and  M&E  consultants  are  presented  in  Supplementary \nAppendix M. \n36.  Under the oversight provided by PMU established for the CFL project, each DISCO will \nestablish  project  implementation  cells  to  coordinate  and  manage  their  respective  project \nactivities, and to liaise with the project consultants, MOWP, and the Investment Program\u2019s PMU. \n37.  The  Investment  Program\u2019s  PMO  at  the  Planning  Commission  will  oversee  project \nexecution and coordinate with the project monitoring and evaluation consultants, who will be \nhired specifically for this purpose. The role of the M&E consultants will commence with the \ninitiation of the CFL procurement activities and continue until the end of the project. \n38.  PEPCO will use international competitive bidding for both phases of CFL procurement, on \nbehalf of MOWP, in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from \ntime  to  time).  For  purposes  of  procurement,  shipment  inspection,  and  distribution  to  the \ndistribution utilities, a separate procurement committee will be formed, headed by MOWP and \nPEPCO and with representatives from all DISCOs, and the Investment Program\u2019s M&E staff. \nEndorsement by the procurement committee will be required for the design of bidding documents \nand specifications, award of supply contracts, pre- and post-shipment inspection and quality tests, \nand allocation of CFL consignments to various DISCOs\u2019 regional distribution points. Spot checks \non the CFLs delivered at the port will be conducted by an independent accredited agency, such as \nthe Pakistan Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, contracted specifically for this purpose, \nusing predetermined sampling protocols. \n39.  The utility-based project implementation cells will be responsible for the design and \nimplementation  of  their  respective  CFL  distribution  strategies;  mechanisms;  and  facilities, \nincluding measures for the recovery of incandescent bulbs, vouchers, and their accounting and \ntransportation to regional collection centers. The number of vouchers and incandescent bulbs \ncollected by the utilities will be verified by PEPCO and project M&E staff before their destruction \nand disposal at predetermined locations. The printing, distribution, and redemption of vouchers \nwill be handled in a uniform manner by all utilities, as agreed upon at the project outset between \nPEPCO,  the  DISCOs,  KESC,  and  the  Investment  Program\u2019s  PMO.  Voucher  redemption \nanalysis will be carried out by each utility under supervision of PEPCO, project consultants, and \nM&E staff and consolidated into a central database accessible to all concerned entities. \n40.  Also, MOWP through PEPCO will separately contract with one or more prequalified \ncommunications  firms  for  the  development  and  implementation  of  the  CFL  project \ncommunication (national tri-media publicity and social mobilization) campaigns. These contracts \n                                                 \n3  ADB. 2008.

The effectiveness of the \ncommunications strategy will be gauged during and after each phase by the project M&E \npersonnel via consumer surveys. \n41.  Because of the significant macroeconomic impacts anticipated from the CFL project, all \nrecruitment and procurement are proposed to be financed by the Government from the project \nloan proceeds.. \nG.   Assessment of Clean Development Mechanism Potential \n \n42.  Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) projects are expected to establish a baseline \nscenario, which would have prevailed had the CDM project not been undertaken. To do this, the \nCDM executive board has approved a range of approved methodologies from which the project \nparticipants should select the most appropriate for the scope of the project. If no methodology is \napproved that is directly applicable to the project, the project participants may propose either a \nnew methodology or request the revision of an existing approved methodology, which with some \nmodifications could be applied to the scope of the project. The CFL project falls under the sector \nscope  \u201c3:  Energy  Demand\u201d  as  defined  under  the  CDM  modalities  and  procedures.  Three \napproved CDM methodologies are available: one large-scale4 and two small-scale.5 Due to the \ncomplexity of monitoring requirements and limitation of applicability conditions, the small-scale \nmethodology AMS-II.J is considered the best suitable approved methodology for this project. \n43.  Applicability conditions and other requirements of the AMS-II.J are checked against the \nproposed  mechanism  of  CFL  distribution.  The  AMS-II.J  requires  verification  of  recovered \nincandescent bulb wattages, and documentation of the recovery and destruction process and \npost-project CFL installations, but does not require verification of actual CFL usage hours. Major \nCDM requirements of AMS-II.J are as follows: \n(i)  The CFL distribution will be limited to residential customers. \n(ii)  CFLs utilized under the project will, in addition to standard lamp specifications, be \nmarked for clear unique identification for the project. \n(iii)  Incandescent bulbs will be returned, stored, and destroyed. \n(iv)  The project will undertake at least one of the following measures: \n(a)  directly installing CFLs; \n(b)  charging at least a minimal price for a CFL; and/or \n(c)  restricting the number of CFLs per household distributed to six. \n(v)  Whether the CFLs are directly installed or not, the project design document \n(PDD) will define the actions to be taken to encourage CFLs being installed in \nlocations within residences where the utilization hours are relatively high, for \nexample  common  areas.  For  CFLs  not  directly  installed,  these  actions  can \ninclude educating the recipients of the CFLs. \n \n44.  The CDM project is expected to result in real measurable emission reductions that are \nadditional to any that may occur in its absence. In other words, the project participants have to \ndemonstrate that a baseline scenario would have occurred in the absence of the project with \nCDM benefits. In general, this is done by applying a tool for demonstration and assessment of \n                                                 \n4  AM0046: Distribution of efficient light bulbs to households (version 2). \n5  AMS-II.C: Demand-side energy efficiency activities for specific technologies (version 11) and AMS-II.J: Demand-\nside activities for efficient lighting technologies (version 3). \n ", "Appendix 4   53\nadditionality  that  has  been  approved  by  the CDM  executive  board. The  tool  provides  two \nalternate approaches\u2014investment analysis and barrier analysis. \n45.  For this program, additionality can be demonstrated by means of barrier analysis. For \nexample, while the project establishes a new business model of large-scale adoption of CFLs, \nDISCOs have no prior experience in massive CFL distribution and lacks human capacity for \nsuch a demand-side management project. The project of this scale is the first of its kind in the \nworld. DISCOs inevitably perceive a greater risk in pioneering a business model that has \nperformance uncertainty. This \u201clack of prevailing practice\u201d barrier makes the project unattractive \nto implement in the absence of the CDM. In terms of technology, the project represents the first \ncase of employing the 10,000-hour CFLs; currently no 10,000-hour CFLs are available in the \nPakistan market. \n46.  No mandatory law or regulations prohibit the production and use of incandescent bulbs \nin Pakistan. Currently, the World Bank is planning to finance a 3 million CFL distribution project \nin four DISCOs. However, unlike the National CFL Project, the World Bank financed project will \ndistribute CFLs without the recovery of incandescent bulbs, and with fees charged to customers \nto recover CFL costs. Since the World Bank project is still at a planning stage and is expected to \ncommence distribution in 2011, it does not need to be considered for the additionality argument \nof this project. \n47.  The project participants are expected to have considered CDM seriously while taking the \ninvestment decisions for the project. This must be demonstrated with documentary evidence. \nProjects with starting dates after 2 August 2008 must inform the designated national authority \n(DNA) and/or UNFCCC Secretariat within 6 months of the project start date, with the precise \ngeographic location of the project. For project activities that started before 2 August 2008, the \nproject documentation must indicate awareness of the CDM prior to the project activity start \ndate, and must show that the anticipated benefits of CDM were a decisive factor in the decision \nto proceed with the project. Evidence to support this would include minutes and/or notes related \nto the consideration of the decision by the board of directors, or equivalent, of the project \nparticipant, to undertake the project as a CDM project activity. \n48.  Under recently elaborated rules, in case the starting date6 is prior to the beginning of \nvalidation of the project, the project participants have to provide documentary evidence to show \nthat they were aware of the CDM and seriously considered CDM registration necessary for \nimplementing the project. The starting date of the CFL project will be 3 March 2010; the contract \nwill be awarded according to the proposed schedule. \n49.  Based on the application of this methodology, the CFL project is likely to result in \nemission  reductions  of  approximately  5,370,000  tCO e  up  to  end  of  2012.  The  project  is \n2\nexpected to generate approximately 1,260,000 tCO e up to 31 December 2012. \n2\n50.  CDM is a performance-based mechanism, which means that CERs will only be issued if \nthey  are  properly  monitored,  verified,  and  certified  by  an  independent  agency  called  the \ndesignated operational entity. In this sense, the CDM can provide a good incentive to PEPCO \nand  the  DISCOs  to  keep  track  of  CFL  distribution  and  incandescent  bulb  collection  and \n                                                 \n6  As per the CDM glossary of terms, \u201cstarting date\u201d is defined as the earliest date at which either the implementation \nor construction or real action of a project activity begins. It is the date in which the project participant has committed \nto expenditures related to the implementation or related to the construction of the project activity. This, for example, \ncan be the date on which contracts have been signed for equipment or construction and operation services \nrequired for the project activity (para. 67, EB 41 report). \n ", "54  Appendix 4 \nscrapping, and also to maintain proper records, ensuring that no theft or leakage occurs in the \ncourse of CFL distribution. The project will have to establish an operation and monitoring plan, \nas required by the approved methodology applied. This plan will be defined in the PDD, which \nmust be validated by the designated operational entity. \n51.  PEPCO will coordinate and manage the program of activities. Nine or more small-scale \nCDM program activities will be implemented in geographically distinct areas across Pakistan by \ndifferent  distribution  utilities.  The  total  number  of  CDM  program  activities  will  be  optimally \ndetermined in line with the specified ceiling of 60 GWh/year electricity savings eligible for CERs in \neach program of activities to maximize potential CDM revenues. PEPCO will be in charge of the \noverall planning and management of the project, including monitoring. CFL distribution will be a \njoint exercise with PEPCO, the DISCOs, and possibly other downstream distributors. A CDM \nproject management unit will be created, chaired by PEPCO staff and comprising representatives \nfrom the DISCOs. Complete conformance to the PDD monitoring plan will be maintained and \nmonitored  by  the  CDM  project  management  unit.  PEPCO  will  ensure  establishment  of  all \nprocedures,  databases,  and  infrastructure  for  the  smooth  rollout  of  the  CFL  distribution  in \nexchange for eligible incandescent bulbs. It will also ensure high conformance to all procedures \nfor monitoring, to ensure the integrity of data and quality of verification reports. Furthermore, \nPEPCO will provide support during the entire program by way of consumer database sharing, \nsample group formation for post-implementation survey, and other means. \n52.  The management systems and procedures to be implemented by PEPCO upon project \nimplementation will be done to ensure consistent project procedures as well as monitoring, \nprocessing, and reporting of data required for the calculation of emission reductions. In addition \nto the monitoring plan, a project database will be established. All data collected will be fed into \nthe database. All required calculations will be performed within the project database. PEPCO \nwill organize all requirements and supervise all involved bodies. PEPCO will determine the start \ndate as well as the end date of each monitoring interval. The power rating of the replaced \nincandescent bulbs, derived from the lamp marking, will be recorded.  \n53.  To  ensure  reliable  and  transparent  data  collection,  PEPCO  will  prepare  a  project \nimplementation handbook before the start of the distribution, including detailed procedures, \ninstructions, and data forms that are to be used to document all procedures undertaken and \nrequired for project implementation, and data collection and protocols, which are to be applied \nto ensure high quality assurance. \n54.  CDM  development  has  transaction  costs  at  various  stages,  starting  with  PDD \npreparation, which requires consultant time. In some countries, the DNA charges fees for host \ncountry approval. In Pakistan, the fees are zero. For validation of the project the third-party-\ndesignated operational entity charges fees, which vary according to the complexities in the \nproject. The CFL project will require about $300,000\u2013$600,000 for validation. Depending on the \namount of CERs generated by a CDM project annually, registration fees have to be paid to the \nUNFCCC Secretariat. Based on the CER potential of the CFL project, a registration fee of \n$2,500 is expected to be levied. \n55.  Once  implemented,  the  project  participants  will  have  to  monitor  the  parameters  as \nrequired  by  the  CDM  methodology  being  utilized.  The  monitoring  cost  will  depend  on  the \nrequired instrumentation and skill of the monitors. The CFL project will internalize the cost of \nmonitoring or hiring of an independent agency to monitor the project. The project operation and \nthe  monitoring  report  prepared  by  the  project  entity  will  be  verified  by  either  the  same \ndesignated operational entity that validated the project (for small-scale CDM projects) or by \n ", "Appendix 4   55\nanother designated operational entity (for normal-scale CDM project) before being certified. The \ndesignated operational entity will charge a fee for each verification. \nTable A4.8: Schedule of Estimated Costs for the CDM Process \nCDM Process  Budgetary Cost  Assumptions \nPDD Preparation for Program  $400,000\u2013$500,000  Including PDD preparation, consultancy \nof Activities: PDD, standard  services during CDM process, CDM \nCPA-PDD, and approximately  training, support of CDM database \n38 CPA-PDDs   construction \nHost Country Approval  Zero   \nValidation  $300,000\u2013$600,000   \nRegistration  $2,500  Based on 20,000 tCO e \n2\nMonitoring  Internalized   \nVerification and Certification  $400,000\u2013$800,000  $50,000\u2013$100,000 per year x 8 years \nShare of Proceeds (SOP):  $1,070,000  Based on 5,350,000 tCO e \n2\nAdministration \nSOP: Adaptation  2% of issued CERs   \nTotal  Approximately   \n$2 million\u2013$3 million \nCDM = clean development mechanism, CER = certified emission reduction, CPA = CDM program of activities, PDD = \nproject design document, SOP = share of proceeds, tCO e = ton of carbon dioxide equivalent. \n2\nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n56.  The Implementing Agency (or the project participant) will generally enter into a CER \npurchase agreement (CERPA) with a buyer at an appropriate stage of processing. The price of \nCERs contracted will normally be stated in the CERPA or be set by spot market CER prices. \nCER prices vary depending on market conditions, but for example at $10 per CER, the CFL \nproject has potential to generate approximately $12.6 million up to 2012. In addition, the project \ncould generate approximately $20.5 million after 2012 and through 2018. \n57.  The Ministry of Environment is the DNA for CDM in Pakistan. The CDM Secretariat is \nheaded by the director general (environment), Ministry of Environment, who is also the national \nfocal person for the DNA. A CDM cell is established and attached to the CDM Secretariat, which \nacts as the national focal point for the CDM project and issues host country approval to CDM \nprojects on behalf of the Government of Pakistan. \n58.  To obtain host country approval, completed PDDs must be submitted to the director \ngeneral (environment) with a detailed public consultation report and an environmental impact \nassessment (EIA) report or, if no EIA is required, a letter of no-objection or endorsement from \nconcerned authorities. \n59.  Despite the huge potential, Pakistan has not yet taken full benefit of the CDM. Even \nthough the first CDM project from Pakistan was registered with the CDM executive board in \nNovember 2006, the second made it only after a gap of more than 2 years in January 2009. \nAbout 10 projects are currently under validation. \nI.   Monitoring and Evaluation \n \n60.  Impact Evaluation. An exercise will be conducted to evaluate the impact of the project \non household energy consumption and bills. Instead of the usual procedure of comparing the \nsituation before and after the project, a counterfactual (control group), comprising a relatively \n ", "56  Appendix 4 \nsmall number of households that will receive the benefits of the project within the time frame of \nthe project but 4 months later than the rest of the domestic sector, will be employed. The \nevaluation  results  will  provide  useful  (re)design  bases  for  the  succeeding  phase  and  for \nreplication in other developing member country markets. \n61.  Given that the impact of the project may not be homogenous across different types of \nhouseholds,  the  design  must  be  able  to  measure  the  impact  of  the  project  according  to \npreintervention energy consumption (which is itself a proxy variable for household income). \n62.  Project Monitoring. The DISCO PMUs will provide project monitoring through its M&E \nteam. The following M&E activities are envisioned for the project: \n(i)  inspection and verification of CFL shipments received from contracted suppliers, \nincluding compliance with third-party testing and certification requirements for \nrelease of payments; \n(ii)  oversight of allotment of CFL consignments to the DISCOs and receipt at their \nrespective regional distribution points, based on predetermined allocations and \ndelivery schedules agreed upon; \n(iii)  evaluation of each DISCO accounting, delivery, resource allocation, and internal \nauditing  arrangements  for  CFL  delivery,  incandescent  bulb  recovery,  and \nvoucher handling requirements; \n(iv)  spot-checking  of  voucher  distribution,  CFL  delivery,  and  incandescent  bulb \nrecovery at households based on representative sampling of urban, rural, bulk, \nincome, and remote customer stratification; \n(v)  postdelivery surveys of sample representative households to gauge actual CFL \npenetration and use, customer satisfaction, and feedback on delivery mechanism \nand communications campaign; \n(vi)  assistance to MOWP and implementing agencies in designing and conducting \nvoucher redemption analysis at the end of each CFL distribution phase to assess \nproject impact, customer take-up profiles, and associate load and peak electricity \nsavings attributable to the project; \n(vii)  verification of number and type of incandescent bulbs recovered and oversee \ntheir destruction and disposal by PEPCO and the DISCOs; \n(viii)  ensuring that the project communication campaign component is effective in \ndelivering its intended message to all target populations by conducting limited \nconsumer awareness assessment surveys and compiling performance indicators \n(television and radio air time, press advertisements, packaging and marketing \nmaterials developed); \n(ix)  preparation, in collaboration with the implementing agencies, of an overarching \nand nine separate (for each DISCO) detailed project implementation schedules \nand  work  plans  (using  MS  Project  or  similar  software)  identifying  timelines, \nmilestones, resources, and dependencies for each DISCO\u2019s implementation of \neach phase of CFL, voucher, and incandescent bulb transactions and associated \ntasks that will serve as the reference benchmark for progress monitoring; and \n(x)  preparation of monthly M&E reports to communicate project progress, issues, \nmilestone deviations, and performance appraisal to the Investment Program\u2019s \nPMO M&E cell and other project stakeholders (Planning Commission, ADB, AFD, \nMOWP).\n ", "Appendix 5   57\nINVESTMENT PROGRAM MANAGEMENT SUPPORT PROJECT \n \n1.  The Investment Program Management Support Project is necessary to implement the \nenergy efficiency road map and the Energy Efficiency Investment Program. The road map \nactivities  cover  multiple  sectors  of  the  economy  and  require  integrated  planning  and \nmanagement, and a results and monitoring framework. The management support project will \nfocus  on  the  Government's  capacity  to  effectively  manage  energy  sector  planning  and \ninvestments  in  clean  technology  and  energy  efficiency.  It  will  finance  the  following \nsubcomponents: (i) preparation of subsequent tranche projects, including Clean Development \nMechanism  processing;  (ii)  independent  monitoring  and  evaluation,  and  safeguards; \n(iii) strengthening of energy efficiency standards and testing facilities; (iv) institutional capacity \nbuilding; (v) program management operations; and (vi) a compact fluorescent lamp (CFL) waste \nmanagement demonstration facility. The total cost is estimated to be $25 million. Cost estimates \nare provided in Appendix 6. A description of key components follows.  \n \n2.  Program  Management  Office  Support.  A  dedicated  program  management  office \n(PMO)  will  be  established  at  the Planning  Commission  for  the  duration  of  the  Investment \nProgram. It will be responsible for implementation and administration of the overall program. \nThe PMO will conduct policy coordination among all government agencies involved in the \nenergy efficiency projects; supervise implementation of the sector road map; develop projects \nfor future tranches; monitor program performance and compliance requirements; and provide \nthe  necessary  overall  management,  reporting,  communications,  and  financing  functions \nrequired for these purposes. It will act as the focal point between the Government, Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB), project consultants, and various project implementing agencies. The \nroad  map  implementation  consultants  will  help  the  Planning  Commission  expedite \nimplementation of the energy efficiency sector road map, including (i) develop relevant energy \nefficiency policy and regulation framework; (ii) formulate a 10-year national energy efficiency \nand  conservation  (E3C)  policy  and  action  plan;  (iii)  update  a  national  energy  efficiency \ninvestment plan (2009\u20132016); and (iv) promote the public sector E3C program, and establish \nguidelines, criteria, and procedures for ensuring the E3C program is implemented in all major \nsectors. Consultants will be tasked to transfer expertise to the PMO staff and increase the \ninstitutional capacity of the Government.  \n \n3.  Consulting  service  for  preparation  of  subsequent  investment  projects  will  provide \nresources to ensure project preparatory activities linked to subsequent tranches can be carried \nout on schedule and with optimum design. The project preparation consultant will assist the \nPMO and relevant parties in (i) identifying future investment projects; (ii) carrying out technical, \nfinancial, and economic assessment of the projects; and (iii) conducting environmental and \nsocial safeguards due diligence assessment. \n \n4.  External  monitoring  and  evaluation  consultants  will  ensure  that  the  projects  are \nimplemented  in  accordance  with  the  approved  specifications  and  in  particular  that  the \nenvironmental and social safeguard aspects are implemented in accordance with the approved \nplans, through the establishment of a monitoring function. \n \n5.  The Planning Commission will employ consultants to provide varying services to the \ncommission  depending  on  needs  and  capabilities.  The  draft  terms  of  reference  for  the \nconsulting services are given in Supplementary Appendix N. \n \n6.  Strengthening of National Standards and Testing Facilities. The Pakistan Standards \nand Quality Control Authority (PSQCA), under the Ministry of Science and Technology, is the \n ", "58  Appendix 5 \nnational standardization body. At present, the Government specifies some quality standards for \nlighting and other electrical appliances, but these do not adequately cover all main product \ncategories, types, or sizes; nor are they properly enforced. The management support project will \nprovide  PSQCA  with  financial  resources  to  introduce  and  adopt  international  energy \nperformance standards1 for products and subcomponents that are predominantly imported into \nthe  country.  This  includes  the  proper  selection  and  harmonization  of  multiple  standard \nspecifications  existing  internationally,  to  ensure  that  those  most  suitable  for  the  Pakistan \ncontext\u2014that do not unnecessarily penalize the country\u2019s existing manufacturers and supply \nsources\u2014are  adopted.  This  is  of  particular  importance  for  projects  for  residential  CFL \nreplacement, gas appliance upgrades, public building retrofits, and industrial energy efficiency \nfinancing.  \n \n7.  In addition, assistance will be provided to the Pakistan Council of Scientific and Industrial \nResearch (PCSIR), under the Ministry of Science and Technology, to rapidly augment existing \nnational equipment testing and certification facilities, to enable them to achieve international \naccreditation and capacity for meeting the needs of the strengthened national energy efficiency \nstandards regime. These activities will be undertaken in collaboration with other development \npartners.2 In particular, the laboratory facilities and training requirements of PCSIR to undertake \nthe quality monitoring of lamps procured through spot checking of bulk CFL shipments will need \nto be in place by 1 April 2010. The detailed arrangements for strengthening PSQCA and PCSIR \nwill be elaborated during project implementation.  \n \n8.  Institutional Capacity Development. In addition to the project-specific management \nand  planning  capacity  at  the  Planning  Commission,  some  key  focal  agencies  will  need \nstrengthening to facilitate program implementation and to create an enabling environment for \nproject implementation. The Energy Wing, Planning Commission is the coordinating unit for \nfederal government budget appropriations for energy projects. To be able to integrate E3C into \nintegrated energy planning, project evaluation, and public sector investment and infrastructure \ndevelopment, the Energy Wing will require financial assistance for procurement of equipment, \ndevelopment of energy databases, office upgrades, and hiring of consulting services for internal \nrestructuring and expansion.  \n \n9.  The National Energy Conservation Centre (ENERCON), in existence since 1985 and \ndedicated to the promotion of E3C in the country, will be a natural home for the program given \nits mandate and accumulated experience in the field. However, the institution has, since the \ntermination of the initial technical and financial assistance funded by the United States Agency \nfor  International  Development  in  1990,  been  severely  underresourced  and  has  functioned \nmostly on project-based aid assistance. As a result, it has lost most of its key technical staff, \nprofessional facilities, business processes, and knowledge base required to fulfill its original \nmandate  for  coordinating,  promoting,  and  facilitating  all  national  energy  efficiency  and \nconservation efforts. In addition, it has not been able to commercialize E3C activities effectively \nso that it could take on its intended ultimate role of providing a supportive policy, regulatory, \nadvisory, and enabling environment for the implementation of E3C actions by the public and \nprivate sectors and energy end-users themselves. \n \n                                                 \n1  Examples include the US EnergyStar rating for domestic and office equipment, and Euro emission standards for \nvehicles. \n2  The 3-year Global Environment Facility and United Nations Development Programme regional Barrier Removal for \nthe Cost-Effective Development and Implementation of Energy Efficiency Standards and Labeling project initiated \nin 2009. \n ", "Appendix 5   59\n10.  The  Government  plan  to  reallocate  ENERCON  under  the  Planning  Commission, \nredefining its mandate as a national umbrella E3C policy, program, and technical advisory and \nmarket facilitation body; and development and implementation of the energy efficiency sector \nroad map and the National E3C Action Plan. The program will provide substantial support for \nENERCON's restructuring, including procurement of equipment and engagement of staff, and \nstrengthening its capacity in (i) planning, (ii) design, (iii) project management, (iv) operations, \nand (v) maintenance activities.  \n \n11.  CFL  Waste  Management  Facility. Burnt-out CFLs are potentially hazardous waste \nbecause of the presence of mercury. Disposal into municipal landfill and dumping sites can \nresult in release of mercury into the soil and to water bodies. Currently, the country has no lamp \nwaste management facility. The waste generated from fluorescent tube lights (FTLs) and CFLs \nused in the country are dumped with other municipal waste into various waste dumping sites or \nare crushed without any safety consideration for disposal of glass. The 30 million CFLs to be \ndistributed under the proposed program will contain between 100 and 120 kilograms of mercury. \nThus a lamp waste management facility (LWMF) with the required handling capacity is needed. \nModern facilities are designed to recover glass, metal, mercury, and chloride salt from the waste \nlamp for reuse.   \n \n12.  The proposed CFL distribution program envisages distribution of 10 million CFLs in \nphase 1, spread over 4 months, and distribution of another 20 million CFLs in phase 2, spread \nover 6 months. Phase 2 will be initiated about 8 months after completion of phase 1. The CFLs \nprocured for distribution will have a specified life of 10,000 hours. Given that the average usage \nof CFLs in the domestic sector is about 3.5 hours per day, the CFLs are expected to last more \nthan 8 years, on average. However, issues with waste CFLs are likely to start much before that \nfor a number of reasons. First, manufacturing defects and mishandling may result in burning out \nand breakage of CFLs before completion of their rated life. Second, the CFLs may replace \nFTLs, which also contain about 10\u201315 milligrams of mercury and require a proper handling \nfacility. Third, the awareness campaign associated with the program is likely to generate a need \nfor a waste disposal facility for the CFLs already in use in the country. About 3% of the CFLs \n(900,000) distributed under the program are expected to require disposal within 3 years after the \nstart of the program. As the typical capacity of a compact lamp waste management facility is \nabout 0.4 million\u20130.5 million CFLs per month, the program envisages that a facility will be \ndeveloped and begin operating in year 3 of the program.  \n \n13.  To  make  the  facility  a  viable  and  sustainable  mechanism,  waste  treatment  will  be \norganized on a commercial basis. Payment will be made for used CFLs and for fluorescents in \ngeneral. One option is to get trash collectors to pick up used fluorescents, bring them to a \ncollection point, and be paid for the waste. Private trash recyclers could manage and run the \ncentral waste collection facilities suitably located around the country.  \n \n14.  Once lamps have been accumulated at the collection points, a recycling mechanism \nwould need to be set up to treat them. The CFL project will provide an opportunity to establish \nrequired recycling facilities in the country for all fluorescent lamps. Survey results show that the \ndomestic sector in Pakistan currently has 113 million light points. Of these, approximately 60% \nutilize fluorescent lamps, including tubes and existing CFLs. Up to four recycling facilities are \nexpected to be required initially, perhaps distributed across the capitals of each province to limit, \nas much as possible, the cost of transportation of used fluorescent lamps.  \n \n ", "60  Appendix 6 \nTRANCHE 1 COST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING PLAN \n \nTable A6.1 shows the summary of cost estimates for the National Compact Fluorescent Lamp \nProject, and Table A6.2 shows the summary of cost estimates for the Investment Program \nManagement Support Project. The cost estimation was carried out in accordance with the \nFinancial Management and Analysis of Projects1 of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and \nis expressed in constant 2009 prices. Contingencies of 5% are added where price contingencies \nare  based  on  local  and  foreign  inflation.  In  addition,  interest  during  construction  and \ncommitment charges are included. The tax and duty structure in Pakistan has been assessed to \nbe reasonable, and in April 2008, the ADB Management has approved the financing of taxes \nand duties for projects in Pakistan. Taxes and duties are eligible for financing under the ADB \nPakistan: Country Partnership Strategy 2009. Accordingly, ADB financing will cover taxes and \nduties where appropriate for the Tranche 1 projects.  \n \nTable A6.1: National CFL Project Cost Estimates  \n($'000)  \nItem    Total  ADB  %  AFD  %  Gov't  % \nA.

Implementation  of  the  Energy  Efficiency  Investment  Program  requires  dedicated \ninstitutional and management capacity within the Government of Pakistan for the effective \nplanning, execution, and support of various program components. Such capacity should be \n \n(i)  centralized,  to  be  able  to  coordinate  with  all  other  agencies  and  national \nstakeholders, properly monitor inputs and activities of the Investment Program, \nand liaise effectively between the Government and the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) and cofinancing agencies; \n(ii)  positioned as an autonomous unit reporting directly to the highest energy sector \nplanning and decision making; \n(iii)  able to directly affect policymaking and direct actions by various ministries, line \nagencies, and government departments; and \n(iv)  technically  proficient  to  undertake  design,  development,  implementation,  and \nevaluation of current and future tranche projects; coordinate with other relevant \ngovernment  and  aid  programs;  provide  necessary  safeguards  compliance \nassurance;  conduct  program  reporting  and  presentations;  and  engage  and \ninteract with external consultants for this purpose. \n \n2.  An assessment of government structure and capacity found that none of the existing \nagencies within the federal (central) Government meet all of these key requirements. Given the \nassessment of the existing relevant Government institutional capacity, the Investment Program \nwill  be  implemented  by  a  dedicated  program  management  office  (PMO)  in  the  Planning \nCommission.  \n \n3.  Executing Agency. The Planning Commission of Pakistan will be the Executing Agency \nfor  the  Investment  Program  and  will  manage  overall  implementation,  and  monitoring  and \nevaluation. It will be responsible for the submission of periodic financing requests to ADB. \nIndividual  projects  and  subprojects  to  be  financed  under  the  Investment  Program  will  be \nidentified and prepared by the line or sector ministries and, as appropriate, concerned agencies \nin the relevant sector(s). The Energy Efficiency and Conservation Consultative Group (EECCG) \nwill function as the platform for stakeholder consultations, and each project will be properly \nvetted against the project selection criteria. The Planning Commission has agreed with a facility \nadministration manual that specifies the roles and responsibilities of each office and team.  \n \n4.  Program Management Office. The PMO (Figure A7.1) will support the Office of the \nMember (Energy), Planning Commission and the concerned agencies for implementation of  \n(i) the road map\u2014policy, planning, interagency and development agency cooperation, and \ncapacity building support; and (ii) the Investment Program\u2014reporting, monitoring, selection and \npreparation of investment projects, and consultant support. The PMO will be sufficiently staffed \nby, and obtain resources from, the Investment Program Management Support Project. The \nPMO structure will comprise the following core teams: technical; legal; safeguards; gender \nmainstreaming; and monitoring, evaluation, and reporting. The PMO will inform the EECCG on \nthe road map and implementation progress of the Investment Program. It will facilitate EECCG \nmeetings.  \n \n5.  The PMO will be managed by a highly qualified full-time project director, assisted by a \nfull-time deputy project director. PMO management will report directly to the Member (Energy), \nPlanning  Commission  on  a  day-to-day  basis  as  well  as  via  formal  project  communication \nprocedures.

The  financial  analysis  of  the  projects  under  the  first  tranche  was  carried  out  in \naccordance with the Asian Development Bank (ADB) Financial Management and Analysis of \nProjects.1 All financial costs and benefits are expressed at constant mid-2009 prices. Cost \nstreams used to determine the financial internal rate of return (FIRR), i.e., capital investment, \ncompact fluorescent lamp (CFL) distribution, reflect costs of delivering the estimated benefits. \n \nA.  Assumptions \n \n2.  The  FIRR  is  calculated  for  the  procurement  and  distribution  of  30  million  CFLs  in \nPakistan. Capital costs are estimated in Pakistan rupees using prices prevailing in mid-2009, \nexpressed in constant prices. Capital costs are derived from local sources, including physical \ncontingencies at 10% of base costs. Price contingencies and interest during implementation are \nexcluded in the estimation of capital costs for the FIRR. \n \n3.  Financial viability is examined by comparing the incremental costs and benefits with and \nwithout the investment scenarios. The CFL project\u2019s incremental benefits arise from increased \nenergy efficiency of household lighting, resulting in a reduction of subsidies being provided to \nratepayers who pay below-market electric rates. Another incremental benefit accrues from the \nsale of the saved energy to other consumers (Table A9.1). The estimated saved energy per \ncustomer class was converted into monetary terms based on the tariff schedule notified in \nFebruary 2009. Other incremental benefits include the reduced evening peak load resulting from \nthe reduced demand for lighting during evening peak hours, and deferred investment in new \nthermal generating plants and the consequent deferred carbon emissions. The benefits are \nassumed to begin accruing in FY2010, when the first 6-month distribution of 10 million CFLs will \noccur. A second distribution of 20 million CFL will occur in FY2010 or FY2011. \n \nTable A9.1: Financial Benefits of the Compact Fluorescent Lamp Project \nEnergy \nSavings \nCustomer  Tariff  Subsidy  Cost of  Average  per \nClass \u2013  Revenue  Received/  Service  Tariff  Class  Subsidy  DISCO Profit \nUsage in  Number of  Units Sold  (PRs  Paid  (PRs/  (PRs/  (GWh/  Savings  from Excess \nkWh  Customers  (GWh)  million)  (PRs)  kWh)  kWh)  yr)  (PRs)  Sales \n< 50  5,767,943  1,911  2,676  8,354  5.77  1.40  663  2,898,534,694  2,898,534,694\n51\u2013100  4,012,649  3,051  9,852  8,268  5.94  3.23  543  1,471,006,755  1,471,006,755\n101\u2013300  5,040,193  12,789  62,670  18,558  6.35  4.90  612  888,254,187  888,254,187\n301\u2013700  583,950  7,584  60,441  (11,518)  6.45  7.97  81  (123,053,782)  (123,053,782)\n>700  107,109  2,892  28,926  (9,810)  6.61  10.00  6  (20,340,249)  (20,340,249)\nTotal  15,511,844  28,227  164,565  13,852      1,905   \n        Total Annual Revenue (PRs)  5,114,401,606  2,345,140,266\n        Total Annual Revenue ($)  63,930,020  29,314,253\nDISCO = distribution company, GWh = gigawatt hour, kWh = kilowatt hour, PRs = Pakistan Rupees. \n4.  For the analysis, the projected growth in electricity demand is assumed to continue to \nexceed supply, and all energy saved by the CFL project will generate income to the distribution \ncompanies (DISCOs) through reduced subsidies and the sale of the saved energy to other \nusers for at least 9 years. Transmission and distribution savings that normally accrue to energy \nefficiency projects are assumed to be zero as all saved energy will be distributed to other users \nand the current T&D losses will be unchanged. \n5.  CFL  unit  cost  is  estimated  at  $1.37.  The  actual  cost  will  be  generated  through  a \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2005.

CFL  distribution  costs  are  calculated  based  on  estimated  cost  of  DISCO \nemployees distributing the CFLs door-to-door within their respective service territories. Voucher \nprinting costs are estimated based on the marginal cost of printing the vouchers as part of the \nnormal printing of utility bills. Communication and marketing costs are estimated based on the \ncosts of these activities in CFL programs in other countries. \n \nB.  Financial Internal Rate of Return \n \n6.  The weighted average cost of capital is estimated at 11.4%. Calculated from the \nfinancial benefits in Table A9.3, the FIRR of the Project is 97.62%, including the capital costs of \nthe Project and financial benefits. The high FIRR is due to the strong financial benefits of CFLs \nin the Pakistan electric power system, particularly the reduced subsidies afforded by energy \nsavings in the households of ratepayers paying below-market rates. The FIRR exceeds the \nweighted average cost of capital, and therefore, the project is financially viable. \n \nTable A9.2: Financial Analysis of the Compact Fluorescent Lamp Project \n($ million) \nProfit \nProject  from  Gross  Cash Flow  Net Cash \nCapital  Subsidy  Excess  Expected  After Debt  Flow to \nYear  Cost  Savings  Sales  Revenue  Service  Project \n0  (31,734,497)          (31,734,497) \n1  (63,468,993)  21,310,007  9,771,418 31,081,424  31,081,424  (32,387,569) \n2    63,930,020  29,314,253 93,244,273  93,244,273  93,244,273 \n3    63,930,020  29,314,253 93,244,273  93,244,273  93,244,273 \n4    63,930,020  29,314,253 93,244,273  93,244,273  93,244,273 \n5    63,930,020  29,314,253 93,244,273  93,244,273  93,244,273 \n6    63,930,020  29,314,253 93,244,273  93,244,273  93,244,273 \n8    63,930,020  29,314,253 93,244,273  93,244,273  93,244,273 \n8    63,930,020  29,314,253 93,244,273  93,244,273  93,244,273 \n9    63,930,020  29,314,253 31,081,424  93,244,273  93,244,273 \n( ) = negative value. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nC.

The sensitivity analysis reveals that the project is viable even in the event that both \n ", "74  Appendix 9 \nbenefits and costs change to its disadvantage by 10%. \n \nD.  Risk Analysis \n \n9.  Regulatory or tariff revision risk for this tranche is low. Tariff increases could reduce \nsubsidies and thus energy savings at subsidized households will not yield as much income to \nthe DISCOs. However, the lifeline tariff (0\u2013100 kilowatt-hours) is not likely to be raised quickly \nand this is the segment with the largest number of incandescent bulb users. The largest risk in \nthe CFL project is theft of CFLs; although if stolen CFLs are used in Pakistan, they will still \ngenerate savings and contribute to peak reduction. \n \n10.  Geopolitical and political risks are present as for all projects in Pakistan. However, the \nhigh number of households involved and their geographic spread lessen the risk of significant \nenergy savings not accruing. \n ", "Appendix 10   75 \nSUMMARY OF ECONOMIC ANALYSIS \nA.  Economic Assumptions \n1.  The economic analysis of the Pakistan Energy Efficiency Investment Program is in line \nwith a standard cost\u2013benefit analysis framework and in accordance with Asian Development \nBank Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects.1 Since economic costs and benefits \noccur at different times, an economic discount rate of 12% is used to reflect the time factor and \nenable all economic costs and benefits to be expressed and compared in constant April 2009 \nprices. The exchange rate in Pakistan is a managed floating rate, i.e., it is allowed to fluctuate in \nthe exchange market within prescribed ceiling and floor values. No adjustments are therefore \napplied to it. The rate used is PRs80 = $1, which was the average for month of April 2009. \n \n2.  A managed floating exchange rate does not imply the lack of distortions (taxes, duties, \nand subsidies) in the balance of payments. Therefore, a standard conversion factor, determined \nfor Pakistan at 0.92, is applied to all domestic prices. \n \n3.  The  base  case  oil  price  is  taken  as  $50  per  barrel,  the  average  for  April  2009. \nCorresponding actual petroleum product prices are used and market rates are corrected for \ntaxes, levies, and distortions.  \n \nB.  Project Cost\u2013Benefit Analysis \n \n4.  Project  components  complement  each  other  in  reducing  energy  consumption  in  the \ncountry. The six projects identified include distribution of compact fluorescent lamps (CFLs) in the \ndomestic sector, upgrades in the national gas transmission and distribution systems, reduction in \nthermal power generation losses, energy efficiency retrofits in government buildings, replacement \nof domestic gas appliances, and replacements and modifications in machinery and equipment to \nimprove energy performance in the industry sector. In this analysis, the economic benefits of the \nprojects are taken as the value of electricity, natural gas, oil, and coal saved by introducing \nenergy-efficient replacements and retrofits in the targeted sectors. \n \nC.  Evaluation of Project Costs and Benefits \n \n1.  Project Costs \n5.  The capital costs of the project to society are the costs of equipment, procurement, and \nproject  implementation.  They  include  physical  contingencies,  but  exclude  interest  during \nconstruction and price contingencies. The total project cost is expressed in 2009 prices. \n \n6.  The operation and maintenance (O&M) costs of the project to society are the costs of \nfuel,  labor,  and  spare  parts  required  to  maintain  equipment  efficiency.  Under  the  gas \ncompressor upgrade, thermal power plant loss reduction, and industrial efficiency programs, \nO&M expense is expected to be lower than current O&M costs,2 with new equipment having \nincreased automation. The remaining programs have negligible O&M costs.  \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 1997. Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects. Manila. \n2  A detailed study for each project will be conducted at the tranche design stage. \n ", "76  Appendix 10 \n2.  Project Benefits \n7.  Project benefits include energy savings from energy-efficient replacements and retrofits \nunder the various proposed projects. These energy savings are valued at their economic price. \nThe economic price of gas is equated to the next-best alternative fuel for each sector. Natural gas \nis priced at the economic price of imported liquefied natural gas (LNG), which is the alternative \nfuel in the domestic and commercial sectors. The economic price of LNG is estimated at the \nexisting price of crude oil ($50 per barrel), using the pricing formula currently being considered by \ngovernment authorities. For the power subsector, the economic price of fuel oil is used. For the \nindustry sector, the economic price of fuel oil is used as a proxy economic price for natural gas \nused by industry. Gasoline is the alternative fuel to compressed natural gas in vehicles; therefore, \nthe economic price of natural gas in the transportation sector is equated to the economic price of \ngasoline. Border prices of petroleum products in the country are linked directly with international \ncrude oil prices. The market price of high-speed diesel, fuel oil, and light-diesel oil is corrected for \nthe petroleum development levy3 and general sales tax of 16% to arrive at the economic price for \ngasoline. In the case of high-speed diesel, an import tariff is additionally applied on the import-\nparity price, which is incorporated into the economic price as well. The market price of indigenous \nand imported coal is adjusted for sales tax to arrive at the economic price of coal. \n \n8.  Pakistan is presently facing serious power supply deficits; the situation is unlikely to \nimprove in the next 3\u20135 years. In these conditions, electricity saved through energy efficiency \nmeasures will make a corresponding amount of energy available to users who are otherwise \ndeprived of power supply. The benefit of additional power supplied under this project is the \navoided loss to the economy as a whole due to load shedding, or power outages, without the \nproject. Consumers\u2019 willingness to pay for the power not supplied is used as a proxy for the \neconomic benefit of the electricity saved. Assuming that all segments of society are equally \ndeprived under a shortfall situation, and each will equally capture the electricity saved from the \nprojects, willingness to pay is approximated by the average electricity tariff4 net of subsidy. It \nreflects society\u2019s willingness to pay during power shortages. Following the elimination of deficits \nin  power  supply,  electricity  savings  can  be  valued  at  the  system\u2019s  marginal  peak  rate  of \ngeneration,  which  in  the  case  of  Pakistan  ranges  from  PRs7.0/kilowatt-hour  (kWh)  to \nPRs8.5/kWh.5 In view of the uncertainty associated with the timing of possible capacity additions \nand  elimination  of  power  supply  deficits,  willingness  to  pay  corresponding  to  an  average \nelectricity tariff of PRs6.06/kWh6 is taken as a conservative estimate for the economic price of \nelectricity throughout the analysis period.   \n \n9.  The total project costs under the Investment Program are estimated at $1,180 million. \nAfter valuing energy benefits at the economic price, the aggregated economic internal rate of \nreturn (EIRR) for the six projects is determined as 66%. The individual project EIRR is 145% for \nthe CFL distribution program, 32% for gas compressor replacement, 26% for the reduction in \nthermal power generation losses, 21% for energy efficiency retrofits in government buildings, \n395% for replacement of domestic appliances, and 27% for improving energy performance in \n                                                 \n3  The petroleum development levy was replaced with the carbon surcharge effective 1 July 2009. The imposition of \nthe carbon surcharge, however, was temporarily stayed by a Supreme Court ruling on 7 July 2009. \n4  A small segment of domestic, commercial, and industrial consumers opt for standby generation fueled by high-speed \ndiesel or gasoline. The willingness to pay for this segment is substantially higher than the electricity tariff applied by the \nutility. The average electricity tariff is therefore a conservative estimate for the willingness to pay for society as a whole.   \n5  Considering the implementation of tranche 3 (reduction in thermal power plants loss), the likely marginal peak \ngeneration rate will drop to PRs7.0\u2013PRs7.5 per kWh, compared to the current rate of PRs8.23 per kWh.   \n6  Pakistan Electric Power Company Tariff Revenue, Energy Sales, and Subsidy Analysis for FY2008\u2013FY2009. \n ", "Appendix 10   77 \nthe industry sector.

Improving energy efficiency and energy conservation, in general, leads to a cleaner and \nbetter  environment.  Power  generation,  particularly  from  fossil  fuels,  has  far-reaching \nenvironmental impacts, which will be mitigated by end users saving electricity and improving \nenergy efficiency in electricity generation, transformation, and distribution.  Improving energy \nefficiency in the country will reduce emissions of atmospheric pollutants in the transportation \nand  industry  sectors,  resulting  in  cleaner  air  and  reduced  greenhouse  gas  (GHG) \nemissions.  The natural gas saved will displace heavy fuel oil in power generation and industry, \nwhich will help improve air quality through lower sulfur and particulate emissions. \n \n11.  Carbon emission reduction potential for the CFL project based on Clean Development \nMechanism  methodology  is  estimated  at  908,000  tons  of  carbon  dioxide  (CO )  equivalent \n2\n(tCO e) per year. At a conservative price of $10/tCO e this will generate revenues of about $9 \n2 2\nmillion per year. \n \n12.  The remaining projects will result in numerous environmental benefits. The benefits from \nreduction of GHG emissions and the contribution to mitigate climate change can be shared \nregionally and globally. However, the literature on climate change suggests that avoided global \ndamage from reducing CO  emissions, or the social value of carbon, is likely to be significantly \n2\nlarger than the carbon market value.7 The Project\u2019s EIRR, even without accounting for the social \nvalue of carbon on the benefit side, significantly exceeds the economic hurdles rate of 12%. \nTherefore,  keeping  on  the  conservative  side,  the  environmental  benefits  associated  with \nreduced GHG emissions are not accounted for in the overall economic analysis.8 \n \n13.  Under the CFL project, 30 million CFLs will be distributed throughout the country. By \nprocuring the CFLs at wholesale price, the price per lamp will be reduced from the local retail \nprice. A survey conducted during the project design determined the wattage of incandescent \nbulbs in use (Supplementary Appendix I). About 62% of electrified households in Pakistan \ncurrently  use  100  watt  (W)  incandescent  bulbs,  and  the  rest  use  either  60  W  or  40  W \nincandescent  bulbs.  Single  wattage  (20\u201323  W)9 CFLs  will  be  procured  under  the  project, \nequivalent to at least 100 W incandescent bulbs in lumens output. Each replacement will result \nin a saving of 18\u201378 W, depending on the incandescent bulb wattage replaced. With 3.5 hours \nof average use per day, each replacement will save about 77 kWh annually, contributing to total \nannual energy savings of 2,132 gigawatt-hours per year. This will result in capacity savings of \n1,094  megawatts,  assuming  a  nationwide  lamp  use  coincidence  factor  of  66%  during  the \nevening peak. Transmission and distribution losses are not included as benefits of the project as \nthe energy saved will be resold to other users and thus T&D losses will remain unchanged. The \nenergy benefits are estimated based on a 7.7-year life of each CFL (corresponding to a 10,000-\nhour life rating). The EIRR of this project is 145%, reflective of a relatively short period in which \ninvestment in a CFL can be recovered. \n \n14.  Upgrades of inefficient gas compressors on the utility networks will result in natural gas \nsavings, which are valued at the economic price of fuel oil; the alternative fuel of choice during \ngas  shortfalls.  Similarly,  upgrades  of  state-owned  thermal  power  plants  (at  generation \ncompanies) will result in their improved efficiency, reducing the plants\u2019 energy intake per unit of \n                                                 \n7  The social value of carbon is estimated as the present value of the total damages inflicted or reduced globally \nwhen an additional unit of CO  is emitted into or taken out of the atmosphere. \n2\n8  An estimation of carbon benefits for each project will be conducted at the tranche design stage. \n9  A wattage band for CFLs (equivalent in lumens produced to a single wattage incandescent bulb) is usually \nindicated to accommodate different manufacturers\u2019 specifications and not bias procurement criteria in favor of any \nparticular supplier. \n ", "Appendix 10   79 \nelectricity generated. The energy saved under the thermal plant upgrade program is therefore \nalso valued at the economic price of fuel oil. \n \n15.  The government buildings retrofit program aims to improve building insulations; heating, \nventilating,  and  air-conditioning  installations;  lighting;  and  controls  in  approximately  50 \ngovernment  buildings.  These  could  include  offices,  hospitals,  schools,  colleges,  and  other \ninstitutions or public facilities. The retrofits will result in reduced electricity consumption, and the \ncorresponding benefits are valued at the economic price of electricity. \n \n16.  Upgrade  and  replacement  of  domestic  gas  appliances  will  reduce  natural  gas \nconsumption for water and space heating, and cooking in households. Under the current gas \nallocation policy, the Government  assigns highest priority to the domestic and commercial \nsectors. Supply of natural gas to these sectors is considered essential or given highest priority. \nWith  increasing  gas  shortfalls,  LNG  will  eventually  have  to  be  imported  to  meet  growing \nhousehold gas demand. Therefore, natural gas savings under the domestic appliance upgrade \nprogram are valued at the economic price of imported LNG, determined at a crude oil price of \n$50 per barrel. \n \n17.  The  industry  sector  has  diverse  energy  uses  and  the  industrial  efficiency  financing \nprogram will result in savings in electricity, natural gas, and coal. These are valued at their \neconomic price; in the case of electricity this is willingness to pay, for natural gas it is the \neconomic price of fuel oil, and for coal it is the economic price of coal (net of taxes and \nsubsidies). \n \n3.  Sensitivity Analysis \n18.  The sensitivity of project economic results to changes in key variables was tested, and \nthe results are summarized in Table A10.3. In general, the EIRRs are sensitive to the variables \ntested, but exceed the economic hurdle rate for all sensitivities tested, including the multiple-\ndownside (combined) scenario.

Environment Aspects \n\u00a0\n1.  Overall Investment Program \n1.  Improving energy efficiency and energy conservation, in general, leads to a cleaner and \nbetter  environment.  Electricity  production,  particularly  from  fossil  fuels,  has  far-reaching \nenvironmental  impacts.  Consequently,  energy  efficiency  is  closely  related  to  environmental \nbenefits. Other than the economic and financial benefits, improving energy efficiency in the \ncountry will decrease the demand for natural resources and reduce atmospheric pollutants, \nresulting in reduced greenhouse gas emissions and consequently less climate change impact. \nMoreover, improved energy efficiency will lower water use and improve water quality, reduce \naccumulation of solid waste, and reduce pressure on natural wilderness and pristine areas from \nfossil fuel biomass and extraction.  \n \n2.  Projects \n \n2.  National  Compact  Fluorescent  Lamp  Project. This project will replace 30 million \nincandescent bulbs in the domestic sector with efficient, high-quality compact fluorescent lamps \n(CFLs).  The  project  will  accelerate  CFL  market  penetration  and  will  result  in  about  a  \n1,094 megawatt reduction in peak evening electricity demand, resulting in savings in electricity \nconsumption of 2,132 gigawatt-hours per year by 2011, thus alleviating power supply deficits \ncurrently common in the country. An initial environmental examination (IEE) of the CFL project \nconcludes that the procurement, distribution, and use of CFLs will not have any significant \nadverse environmental or social impact.  \n \n3.  CFLs typically contain 3\u20134 milligrams of mercury, which is a highly toxic substance. The \nharmful impact of mercury on human health is caused by long-term, low, or chronic exposure, \nwhich affects the kidneys, nervous system, and female reproductive system. Spent CFLs are \ntherefore  potentially  hazardous.  As  Pakistan  currently  has  no  hazardous  waste  handling \nregulations and disposal facilities, facilities dedicated to the handling and disposal of spent CFLs \nwill need to be organized on a commercial basis to properly dispose of the CFLs distributed under \nthe project (in addition to other CFLs and fluorescent tube lamps in use in the country) after they \nhave expired. The lamp waste management system would need to be in place by the fourth year \nof the program as the CFLs distributed under the program begin to reach the end of their \noperating lifetimes (a 10,000-hour rated lamp, used on average for less than 3 hours a day, could \nlast for 10 years). However, the program could be started even earlier to help manage current \nCFL or fluorescent tube lamp disposal needs, as well as to establish and test an effective \nrecycling regime and create the necessary public awareness. The facilities to be developed fall \nunder category B of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) Environmental Assessment Guidelines \n(2003), and consequently an IEE for the facility will be undertaken. Under the environmental \nregulations of Pakistan, \u201ca waste disposal facility for domestic or industrial wastes, with annual \ncapacity of less than 10,000 cubic meters\u201d requires an IEE. The facilities are expected to be \ndeveloped in the private sector and therefore the IEE will be the responsibility of the project \nowners. However, because the facility may not be commercially viable for the private sector, a \ncontingency provision is included in the project budget to establish it in the public sector. In this \ncase, the Executing Agency for the project will be responsible for ensuring that the IEE is \nundertaken and approved. \n \n ", "Appendix 11   81 \n4.  Gas Transmission and Distribution Upgrades. In the natural gas transmission system, \ngas compressors are used to increase the upstream pipeline pressure of the gas by compressing \nit into smaller volumes. The increased pressure allows the transport of the gas through the \ntransmission and distribution pipeline network. Currently, Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Limited \noperates 11 compressor stations that use natural gas as fuel. It proposes to replace the existing \noutdated compressors with new, more efficient, and larger machines to enhance compression \ncapacity and improve system reliability. Installation of more efficient compressors will reduce gas \nconsumption and consequently the emission of air pollutants. The new compressors will replace \nexisting compressors, and will be installed within the premises of the existing facilities. No new \nland will be acquired for this purpose. This component is categorized under category C and \ntherefore no environmental assessment is required. \n \n5.  Thermal  Power  Plant  Loss  Reduction.  The  four  public  sector  power  generation \ncompanies (GENCOs) in Pakistan operate 13 power units based mainly on steam-cycle and \ncombined-cycle  technologies.  For  various  reasons,  mainly  associated  with  the  financial \nconstraints faced by these companies, these plants are being operated at derated capacities \nnearly 25% below their nameplate ratings. The average forced outage rate for the GENCOs, at \n12%, is high compared with 6% for independent power producers in the country. Nearly all \nGENCO plants are operating at much lower efficiency than the industry benchmark for plants of \nsimilar ages and configurations. Due to the aging of several plants, all of the derated capacity and \nefficiency cannot be economically restored. The existing units at three plants\u2014Guddu Steam, \nFaisalabad Steam, and Multan Steam\u2014are proposed to be replaced by modern combined-cycle \nplants. The plant at Guddu is gas-fired and can use the same gas already allocated to the existing \npower plant to fuel the replacement plant. At the other two plants, the less efficient steam-cycle \nplant will be replaced by high-efficiency combined-cycle plants. This will increase the power \ngeneration capacities of the plants by improving efficiencies from the existing 22%\u201331% to 43%\u2013\n48%. The installation of the more efficient plants will also result in overall environmental benefits. \nThese include reduced air pollution, reduced global warming and climate change impact, and less \nwater consumption. The new units will be installed at the existing plant sites. This will avoid the \nrequirement  of  purchasing  new  land,  consequently  eliminating  the  environmental  and  social \nissues  associated  with  land  acquisition  and  resettlement,  and  land  use  conversion.  Lower \nemissions will also benefit the communities living around the plants by reducing potential health \nrisks to them. Good environmental practice demands that the operation of the entire facility \ncomply with applicable environmental standards. Thus, modification of the plants will also address \nthe environmental and social issues associated with the existing plants, and will bring the plants to \npar with modern power plants in terms of their environmental performance. This will be an added \nbenefit to the local community and the environment. Nevertheless, activities associated with the \nconstruction  of  power  plants,  particularly  near  built-up  areas,  have  potential  environmental \nimpacts. A 750 MW plant at Guddu, and 450 MW plants at Faisalabad and Multan, are planned to \nbe replaced. These are categorized as category A projects and will require environmental impact \nassessments  (EIAs)  to  meet  ADB\u2019s  environmental  guidelines.  Under  the  environmental \nregulations of Pakistan, thermal power plants exceeding 200 MW require an EIA.  \n \n6.  Building Retrofits. This program aims at improving energy efficiency through system \nupgrades of three targeted groups of government buildings\u2014offices, hospitals, and educational \ninstitutions. The component includes creation of a new national energy efficiency center under \nthe  management  of  the  Planning  Commission,  the  Executing  Agency  for  the  Investment \nProgram. It includes a detailed study of selected buildings; energy audits; and purchase of \nenergy audit tools, data loggers, and energy analysis software tools for undertaking building \nenergy use analysis. It also includes financing for implementation of energy efficiency retrofits \nfor the buildings selected for efficiency upgrades. The nature of activities in this component is \n ", "82  Appendix 11 \nsuch that no environmental assessments are required as the component is categorized as \ncategory C under ADB guidelines. \n \n7.  Industrial Energy Efficiency Financing. An industry sector energy efficiency fund will be \nestablished to provide loans, contingency loans, or leases for the purchase of energy-efficient \nequipment by industrial plants, especially electrical motors, boilers and furnaces, and other large- \nto medium-scale investments. Small cogeneration units; heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning; \nlighting retrofits; process controls; and other measures could be financed as well. Retrofits and \nexpansions would be supported through working capital and bridge-funding arrangements with \ncommercial banks, supplemented by equity financing from owners. Other than benefits associated \nwith energy conservation, these measures often result in the installation of modern technologies \nthat also have localized benefits, particularly in terms of occupational health and safety for the \nworkers and the local community. Due to their scale and nature, these measures generally fall into \ncategory C assessment and do not require specific environmental assessments. \n \n8.  Domestic Gas Appliance Upgrades. The energy efficiency potential in gas used for \ndomestic water heating in Pakistan is estimated to be 30%, which can be achieved by retrofitting \nexisting water heating appliances. The gas utilities, Sui Southern Gas Company and Sui Northern \nGas Pipelines Limited, have devised some of these retrofits in collaboration with local technical \npartners. These retrofits include (i) a timing device to switch off the heater during parts of the day \nwhen hot water is not required; (ii) descaling to improve heating efficiency; and (iii) flue gas control \nto minimize heat loss from the exhaust. The potential for improvement in energy efficiency in \nspace heating appliances is similarly estimated at 36%, which can be achieved by replacing them \nwith more efficient models.  \n \n9.  The  retrofits  could  be  developed  and  provided  by  the  gas  utility  companies,  or \nalternatively utility companies could involve the private sector in their commercial development \nand marketing. This type of activity is unlikely to involve any significant environmental impact \nand is therefore categorized as C under ADB\u2019s environmental guidelines. \n \nB.  Social Aspects \n\u00a0\n1.  Overall Investment Program \n10.  Pakistan is currently faced with a serious energy crisis to which inefficient use of available \nenergy resources is identified as one of the key contributors. The economic and social impacts of \nthis situation are felt across all sectors of national life. Although some of the economic issues \nconfronting the country can be attributed to the global economic recession, many impacts can be \nclearly linked to the shortfall in energy supply. These include, most importantly, the shutting down \nof industrial units or reduction in their production, resulting in, among other negative impacts, \nunemployment and reduced income for workers. The Government is taking various measures to \novercome  this  issue,  and  identifies  energy  efficiency  as  an  effective,  least-cost  short-  and \nmedium-term  solution.  Improvement  in  energy  supply  will  help  increase  employment  and \neconomic productivity, which will contribute directly to reducing poverty and improving the living \nconditions of workers. Its social benefits will reduce the adverse impact of power outages on \nsocial life, education, and quality of life in general. Indirect and wider economic benefits can also \nfollow to the community through, for example, increased business opportunities for local suppliers \nand retailers.  \n \n11.  Improved energy efficiency will result in the reduction of instances of load shedding. At \ntimes of power shortages, the electricity distribution companies (DISCOs) switch off power \n ", "Appendix 11   83 \nsupply to entire parts of the grid to reduce the load on the distribution system. A common \npractice is to maintain much longer load-shedding hours in rural areas than in urban areas. At \ntimes, load-shedding in rural areas is twice as long in duration compared to the case in towns \nand cities. Availability of additional power supply, made possible through energy efficiency \nsavings, is likely to reduce the occurrence of load-shedding, which would particularly benefit \nrural areas where the majority of the poor population of the country resides.  \n \n2.  Proposed Projects \n12.  National CFL Project. This project will help improve the quality, reliability, and access to \nelectricity in the country. For households, the replacement of incandescent lamps with CFLs is \nexpected to improve lighting conditions, particularly for poor consumers who currently use \ninferior quality or wattage lamps. This is especially important for children, since reading and \nstudying under low lighting can cause eyestrain and lead to poor eyesight. Better lighting in \nhouseholds  will  also  help  improve  the  environment  for  social  and  economic  activities.  In \naddition, CFL lamps will benefit poor customers directly by reducing their electricity bills. The \naverage annual consumer electricity savings per light point is estimated at about PRs293 per \nyear.  This  reduction  is  significant  for  lifeline  consumers,  representing  several  times  their \naverage monthly bills in the case of the lowest categories. Other less tangible benefits include \nincreased public awareness of hazardous wastes, availability of better quality lamps due to \ndevelopment  and  enforcement  of  product  standards  and  labeling,  and  development  of \ncommercial opportunities in waste management.  \n \n13.  Gas Transmission and Distribution Upgrades. This project will not have any direct \nsocial impact other than those associated with overall energy efficiency. \n \n14.  Thermal Power Plant Loss Reduction. The installation of the more efficient thermal \ngeneration plants will result in overall social benefits. Some of these are directly related to \nimproved environmental conditions made possible by the replacements and/or rehabilitation. \nThese include, for example, the health benefits of cleaner air and water. Installation of the units \nat existing GENCO sites will avoid the need for purchasing new land, consequently eliminating \nsocial issues associated with land acquisition and resettlement. Construction-related impacts of \npower plant installation include generation of new employment opportunities; issues associated \nwith migrant workers, such as cultural conflicts between local and nonlocal workers; and traffic \nimpact and community safety hazards caused by construction vehicles. The project EIAs will \ninclude a full-scale community consultation plan for the design, construction, and operations \nphases of the plants.  \n \n15.  Building Retrofits.

POVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.   Links to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \n \nDespite recent efforts to increase capacity and supply, Pakistan is presently suffering from a serious energy \nshortfall. The shortfall is more pronounced in the electricity subsector during peak hours resulting in significant \npower  cuts  affecting  economic  activity  and  delivery  of  social  services.  Recently  these  resulted  in  reduced \nproduction in various industries that left many  workers, mostly belonging to the poor segments of society, \nunemployed. In addition, the phased adjustment of petroleum prices and electricity tariffs starting in 2008 following \nthe increase in international oil prices burdened poor consumers with increased expenses in meeting their energy \nneeds. \n \nAchieving energy security and energy affordability are two main goals set in the Vision 2030 and the Medium-Term \nDevelopment Framework of Pakistan. The recently updated Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRSP-II) for 2009\u20132011 \naims at achieving poverty reduction through sustainable economic growth and employment generation. In achieving \nthese objectives the strategy regards the following as essential: the provision of adequate energy (i) to industry to \ndrive economic growth and create employment opportunities, (ii) to the domestic sector for cooking and heating, \nand (iii) to prevent the continuing environmental degradation and deforestation by massive use of wood for \ndomestic fuel. Based on these government priorities, improving energy efficiency is among the key target outcomes \nof Asian Development Bank (ADB) sector assistance under its country partnership strategy (2009\u20132013) for \nPakistan.a \n \nThe energy savings resulting from improved efficiency under the proposed program are expected to provide a more \nreliable energy supply to various sectors of the economy. The resulting sustained economic activity in particular in \nthe industry sector will indirectly benefit industrial laborers as their jobs will no longer be threatened by power cuts. \nPoor and vulnerable consumers, including social utilities like hospitals and schools, often hardest hit by insufficient \npower supply and load shedding will also benefit from efficient and more reliable delivery of services. Under the \ncompact fluorescent lamp (CFL) distribution program, the use of CFLs by low-income (lifeline tariff) customers \nexpressed as a percentage of total lighting points used is expected to increase from the current 34% of households \nto 74% of households after two phases of distribution. \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                Targeting Classification: General intervention \n1.   Key Issues  \n \nEfficient energy use in all sectors of the economy is expected to help reduce the overall rate of increase of energy \ndemand to more manageable levels and reduce potential shortages. Energy efficiency can reduce large financial \noutlays required for developing additional energy supplies in the future. It can also help minimize uneconomical \nstandby capacity required to cater to peak loads, reduce subsidy requirements, and defer transmission system \nexpansion needs, thereby saving public funds and increasing returns on energy infrastructure investments that \ncould, in return, be directed to social programs. \n \nPoor sectors of society are more often among the hardest hit by the shortfall in energy supply. Typically the \nduration of load shedding is far higher in rural areas than in urban areas or relatively larger cities. The poor are \nexpected to benefit from energy savings realized from implementation of energy efficiency interventions with \nreliable access to energy and improved lighting. This would have an improved impact on households\u2019 economic and \nsocial activities in the evening. In addition, the communication and social mobilization component will provide poor \nhouseholds with information on other affordable energy efficient choices to reduce household energy expenditure. \nThe impact of the promotion of CFLs also depends on affordability and effective distribution channels. \n \nII.  SOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.  Findings of Social Analysis \n Increased investments and market penetration of energy efficient technologies in Pakistan will result in \n   \n(i)  reduction  of  energy  wastage  in  industrial,  residential,  and  public  sector  gas  and  power  consumption: \n2,200 megawatt savings;  \n ", "86  Appendix 12 \n(ii) reduction of energy transformation loss (gas transmission and thermal power generation): 500 megawatt \nsavings; \n(iii) establishment of minimum national energy efficiency standards;  \n(iv) mainstreaming and proper management of energy efficiency in planning and investments; and \n(v) reduction of air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions.  \n \nConsumers\u2019 energy costs will be reduced with the use of efficient technologies and practices. With reduced \nelectricity demand, the overall need for supply (additional generation) will be reduced. Also, a large amount of \ngreenhouse gas emissions\u2014and the associated cost of importing fuel\u2014will be avoided, creating emission reduction \ncredits under carbon financing. The Investment Program will establish a sustainable business model for large-scale \nimplementation of energy efficiency programs. It will reduce public sector energy expenditure, reduce health risks \nassociated with residual mercury and kerosene (in off-grid areas), enhance livelihoods of rural communities, \nfacilitate a viable energy efficiency audit and management industry, and establish a certification process for energy \nand environmentally efficient technologies and practices.  \n \nB.  Consultation and Participation \n \n1.  Consultations were carried out with various government and nongovernment agencies, institutions, and \ncompanies relevant to energy policy, legislation, planning, management, and implementation, which will be \ninvolved in development of the energy efficiency program. \n \n2.   What  level  of  consultation  and  participation  (C&P)  is  envisaged  during  the  project  implementation  and \nmonitoring?  \n Information sharing      Consultation     Collaborative decision making     Empowerment \n \n3.   Was a consultation and participation (C&P) plan prepared?   Yes    No  \n \nC.  Gender and Development \n1.  Key Issues. \nThe program is expected to improve household (and women\u2019s) living standards through increased access to and \nquality of energy services, which will result in greater savings from reduced energy expenditure. A more reliable and \nsecure supply of energy can drastically improve the quality of sanitation; health care; and other social services, \nparticularly education without gender discrimination. \n \n2.  Key Actions.
