Technical  assistance \n(TA) for Capacity Building for SME Development is included. \n \nEconomic activity in Cambodia is dominated by small and medium \nenterprises  (SMEs),  which  are  seen  as  playing  a  major  role  in \neconomic  growth  and  poverty  reduction.  The  proposed  program \nloan  is  the  first  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  policy  loan  to \nCambodia  designed  to  lay  the  foundation  for  SME  development \nfoster  an  enabling  business  environment.  Extensive \nand \nconsultation  with \nthe  Government  and  other  stakeholders \nidentified  the  primary  issues  and  constraints  impinging  on  the \nSME sector; these are addressed in the Program. \n \nAlthough  the  Government  recognizes  the  importance  of  the \nsector, significant legal, institutional, and governance reforms are \nneeded  for  effective  SME  development.  First,  the  costs  of  doing \nbusiness are high due to limitations of the current regulatory and \ngovernance  structures.  Second,  the  missing  legal  structures  and \ninstitutions  lead  to  a  high-risk  lending  environment,  which  limits \nSME  access  to  key  resources,  particularly  finance.  Finally,  the \nGovernment  lacks  an  institutional  and  coordinated  framework  to \nfacilitate SME development, and in many instances the capacity to \naddress  these  issues.  These  factors  underlie  the  sector's  main \nbarriers  to  development,  reflected  by  limited  growth,  informality, \nand underemployment. \n\n \nBorrower \n\nThe Proposal \n\nClassification \n\n \nEnvironment \nAssessment \n \nSocial Sector \nAssessment \n\n \nProgram Description \n\n \nRationale \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nObjective  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\nCost Estimates \n\niii \n\nFostering  an  environment  conducive  to  SME  development  is \nwidely  considered  a  priority.  The  main  issues  for  the  Program \nwere  selected  on  the  basis  of  (i)  significance  for  SMEs'  current \nbusiness operations, (ii) Government commitment to reform in line \nwith  international  experience,  (iii)  ADB's  past  and  ongoing \noperations,  and  (iv)  complementarities  with  other  development \nactivities. \n \nThe Program\u2019s objective is to support the Government\u2019s efforts to \ncreate an environment that is conducive to business development. \nThis  is  particularly  important  for  improving  opportunities  for  SME \ndevelopment. The Program focuses on  \n \n\n(i)  establishing  an  SME  development  framework:  (a)  provide \na long-term strategic framework for SME development, (b) \ndesign  an  institutional  framework  to  seek  better  policy \ncoordination  and  implementation  among  key  Government \nagencies, and (c) promote public-private partnerships and \nthe \nstrengthen \ndevelopment framework;  \n\nto  effectively \n\ninstitutions \n\nimplement \n\nits \n\ntransparency  and \n\n(ii)  improving  governance  and  regulatory  reform  related  to \nSMEs:  (a)  improve  the  business  registration  process  by \nreducing  costs  by \nenhancing \neliminating  unnecessary  requirements,  and \nfacilitating \ndecentralization  of  registration  processes;  and  (b)  reform \nthe  current  business  licensing  system  by  reviewing  and \nremoving  unnecessary \nrequirements, \nstreamlining \nresponsibilities  of \ninstitutions \ninvolved,  and  establishing  a  one-stop \ninformation  window  to  provide  guidelines  and  information \non relevant Government regulations for SMEs; and  \n\nthe  procedures  and \n\nlicenses  and \n\n \n\n \n\n(iii) enhancing  SMEs\u2019  access  to  finance:  (a)  create  simplified \naccounting sets that are better suited to SMEs' needs and \ncapabilities, (b) develop a leasing framework as a potential \nalternative  financing source  for  SMEs,  and  (c)  establish  a \ncredit-information system for the banking sub-sector. \n\n \nThe Program Framework is in Appendix 1.  \n \nThe total loan amount for the Program is determined on the basis \nof the strategic importance of developing the SME sector and the \ncosts  of  structural  reforms  to  be  supported  under  the  Program. \nSuch  costs  arising  from  reform  measures  to  be  implemented \nunder the Program are estimated to be around $25 million to $30 \nmillion  equivalent  during  the  36  months  planned  for  program \nimplementation. \n\n \n\n\fiv \n\n \n\nfor \n\nframework \n\nthe  Program \n\n \nEstimated Program \nCompletion Date \n \nExecuting Agency \n\nCounterpart Funds \n \n \n \n \nProgram Period and  \nTranching \n\nLoan Amount and Terms   A loan of $20 million equivalent from the Special Funds resources \nof  ADB  will  be  provided  The  loan  will  have  a  24-year  term \nincluding  a  grace  period  of  8  years,  an  interest  rate  or  1.0%  per \nannum  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5%  per  annum  thereafter \nand  such  other  terms  and  conditions  set  forth  in  the  draft  loan \nagreement.  \n \nThe  policy \nincludes  specific \ncomponents  with  distinct  structural  adjustment  costs.  The \nGovernment has provided assurances that the necessary funding \nwill be made available to meet those costs.  \n \nThe  Program  will  be  implemented  over  36  months  from  loan \neffectiveness. The loan will be disbursed in three tranches: (i) $7 \nmillion upon fulfillment of specified first tranche release conditions \nupon  loan  effectiveness,  (ii)  $8  million  subject  to  fulfillment  of \nspecified  second  tranche  release  conditions  approximately  18 \nmonths  after  loan  effectiveness,  and  (iii)  $5  million  subject  to \nfulfillment  of  specified  third  tranche  release  conditions  within  36 \nmonths (expected) after loan effectiveness. \n \n31 December 2007  \n \n \nMinistry of Industry, Mines, and Energy (MIME)  \n \nTo  coordinate  program \nimplementation  among  Government \nministries and agencies concerned, a program steering committee \n(PSC) will be formed. The PSC, chaired by the minister of MIME, \nwill  comprise  senior  officers  from  all  ministries  and  Government \nagencies concerned (Ministry of Commerce, Ministry of Economy \nand  Finance,  Ministry  of  Planning,  and  National  Bank  of \nCambodia).  The  PSC  will  meet  at  least  twice  yearly  to  review \npending issues on the Program and propose concrete actions for \ntheir resolution. \n \nThe loan proceeds will be disbursed for a broad range of imports, \nsubject  to  a  negative  list  of  ineligible  items.  All  procurement  of \ngoods  and  services  produced  in  and  originating  from  member \ncountries of ADB will be made with due consideration to economy \nin  accordance  with  standard  public  sector \nand  efficiency \nprocedures  in  Cambodia  and  normal  private  sector  commercial \npractices, acceptable to ADB. The Government will certify that the \nvalue  of \nfrom  nonmember \ncountries,  (ii)  ineligible  imports,  and  (iii)  disbursements  made \nunder  other  official  development  assistance,  is  greater  than  the \namount expected to be disbursed during the year. ADB will have \nthe  right  to  audit  the  use  of  the  loan  proceeds  and  to  verify  the \naccuracy of the Government's certification. \n \n\nImplementation \nArrangements \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nProcurement \n\nimports  minus  (i) \n\nimports \n\ntotal \n\n \n\n \n\n\fRisks and Assumptions \n\n \n\n \n\nTechnical Assistance \n\nv \n\nSuccessful implementation of the Program entails three risks. The \nfirst  relates  to  a  lack  of  capacity  within  the  Government  to \nimplement  some  of  the  complex  reforms.  In  previous  programs, \ndelays  were  caused  predominantly  by  the  lack  of  technical \nexpertise.  To  address  this  risk,  an  advisory  TA  has  been \ndesigned,  in  coordination  with  other  development  agencies  to \nsupport Program implementation, and engage in capacity-building \nmeasures for relevant Government officials. \n \nA  second  risk  relates  to  lack  of  coordination  among  various \nGovernment  agencies.  The  Program  requires  close  coordination \namong the relevant authorities\u2014both horizontally among different \nministries  and  agencies  concerned,  and  vertically  with  the \nprovincial  and  district  authorities.  Consultation  and  coordination \nwill  also  be  required  with  other  stakeholders  active  in  SME \ndevelopment.  The  Program  design  addresses \nthis  risk  by \nemphasizing  the  use  of  interagency  coordination  mechanisms, \nparticularly  by  establishing  an  inter-ministerial  coordination  body \n(National SME Subcommittee) with private sector participation. \n \nA  third  risk  relates  to  good  governance  of  the  central  and  local \ngovernment authorities. Local governance is particularly important \nas that is where the Program will have the most direct impact on \nSMEs.  The  Government  is  addressing  these  risks,  which  are \ncommon  to  several  programs,  through  implementation  of  the \ncomprehensive  Public  Financial  Management  Program, \n(supported by several development agencies, including ADB).  \n \nThe  Government  asked  ADB  to  provide  TA  to  build  capacity  for \nSME  development  for  $0.85  million.  The  TA  will  be  financed  by \nADB  ($500,000),  and  the  Government  of  Denmark  ($350,000). \nThe  TA  will  focus  on  (i)  technical,  legal,  and  policy-related \ninternational \nassistance \nexperience;  (ii)  institution  building  activities,  including  fostering \ngood  governance  and  pilot  implementation  of  new  systems;  and \n(iii) new approaches to training and information dissemination. \n\nreform  agenda  based  on \n\nthe \n\nto \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n1. \nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto  the  Kingdom  of  Cambodia  for  the  Small  and  Medium  Enterprise  (SME)  Development \nProgram  (the  Program).  The  report  also  provides  proposed  technical  assistance  (TA)  for \nCapacity Building for SME Development, and if the Board approves the proposed loan, I, acting \nunder the authority delegated to me by the Board, will approve the TA. The program framework \nis presented in Appendix 1. \n\nII. \n\nTHE MACROECONOMIC CONTEXT \n\n \n\n2. \nCambodia  has  a  population  of  approximately  13.3  million  people,  with  more  than  80% \nliving  in  rural  areas.  Over  5  million,  or  37%  of  the  population,  live  below  the  poverty  line,  with \n90%  of  these  in  the  rural  sector.  With  moderate  economic  growth  over  the  last  decade,  gross \ndomestic product (GDP) per capita remains low at about $300.  \n \n\nTable 1: Basic Economic Indicators \n\n1995 \n\n1998 \n\n2000 \n\n2003 \n\n \n\nItem \nPopulation (in million) \nGDP per Capita (current $)  \nGDP (in $ billion)a \nAgriculture (%) \nIndustry (%) \nService (%) \n\n10.5 \n\u2013\u2013\n3.4\n50.4\n15.0\n34.6\n2,450.8\n853.9\n1,187.0\n\u2013\u2013\n44.3\n7.8\n\u2013\u2013-\n\n12.2 \n252.0\n3.1\n47.1\n17.9\n35.0\n3,744.4\n912.9\n1,073.2\n\u2013\u2013\n15.7\n10.6\n11.1\n\n12.8  \n279.0 \n3.6 \n39.6 \n23.3 \n37.1 \n3,840.8 \n1,327.1 \n1,536.2 \n5,408.8 \n26.9 \n13.3 \n7.2 \n\n13.3 \n307.0\n4.1\n37.2\n26.8\n36.0\n3,984.0\n1,917.0\n2,469.0\n\u2013\u2013\n15.3\n20.3\n7.0\n\nExchange Rate (riel per $1)b \nExport (in $ million) \nImport (in $ million) \nLabor Force (\u2019000)  \nMoney Supply (M2) (% of growth)c \nM2 (% of GDP) \nInterest Rates (%)d  \n\u2013\u2013 = no data available, GDP = gross domestic product. \na  At current producers\u2019 prices. \nb  Average of period. \nc  Annual change. \nd  Deposit, 12 months. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. 2004. Key Economic Indicators-Cambodia (www.adb.org/statistics). \n \n3. \nIn  terms  of  the  three  major  sectors\u2014agriculture,  manufacturing,  and  services,  the \nmanufacturing  sector  has  been  the  most  dynamic.  By  2003,  the  manufacturing  sector  had \ngrown  in  importance  to  account  for  almost  27%  of  GDP  and  8%  of  employment.  This  was \nprimarily driven by growth in the garment industry. The textiles, footwear, and garment industry \naccounts for 12.5% of GDP, and in 2002 its exports accounted for almost 70% of Cambodia's \ntotal exports ($1.2 billion). Approximately 90% of employees in the garment sector are working \nin foreign-owned companies. The service sector has been steady in terms of GDP accounting \nfor  around  33\u201336%.  The  tourism  sector  is  also  heavily  influenced  by  foreign  investments  with \napproximately two-thirds of all approved capital investment coming from abroad. The agriculture \nsector continues to be the main sector in terms of GDP and employment. In 2002, agriculture \naccounted for about 37% of GDP and over 70% of employment.  \n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nthe  Constitution, \n\nthe  enactment  of \n\nCambodia\u2019s  achievements  in  enhancing  development  and  reducing  poverty  have  been \n4. \nsignificant.  Since  the  mid  1980s,  the  Government  has  embarked  on  economic  reforms, \nbeginning  with  the  restoration  of  private  property  rights  and  the  lifting  of  price  controls.  Most \nstate-owned  enterprises  were  privatized,  and  increased  incentives  were  provided  to  local  and \nforeign  private  investment.  The  signing  of  the  Paris  Peace  Accord  in  1991  put  an  end  to  the \nprotracted  civil  wars  and  triggered  rehabilitation  of  the  economy.  After  the  1993  general \nelections  and \nformulating \ncomprehensive macroeconomic and structural reforms, and achieved some significant success \nin stabilizing the economy.1  \n \n5. \nDespite these achievements, the existing legal and regulatory framework for supporting \nenterprise  activities  remains  limited  with  many  necessary  laws  and  subdecrees  still  in  the \ndrafting process or awaiting approval by the Council of Ministers or the National Assembly.2 The \npassage and implementation of these laws will provide further building blocks for establishing an \nenabling business environment for enterprises. Furthermore, the Government\u2019s ability to foster \nan enabling environment for business remains weak. This seems to be primarily because of a \nlack of capacity and transparency in aspects of public administration, compounding Cambodia's \ncurrent limitations on commercial regulations and institutions. Thus, Cambodia's main task is to \ndevelop an enabling environment based on technically sound and transparent legal as well as \ninstitutional systems, aiming to foster a more developed and vibrant commercial sector. \n\nthe  Government  began \n\nA. \n\nSector Description and Performance \n\nIII. \n\nTHE SECTOR \n\n6. \nSMEs  (including  micro-enterprises)  are  estimated  to  dominate  Cambodia\u2019s  economy  in \nterms of number of firms (up to 99%) and employment (estimated 45%). In 2002, the Ministry of \nIndustry,  Mines,  and  Energy  (MIME)  estimated 3  that  the  approximately  26,000  industrial \nestablishments  in  Cambodia.    It  also  reported  that  there  has  been  about  12%  growth  in  the \nnumber  of  medium  sized  enterprises  (those  with  from  30  to  100  employees)  since  1999. \nAlthough textiles and apparel are predominant, diversity is greater among the types of medium-\nsize  enterprises,  including  food  processing,  chemicals,  rubber,  plastic,  and  fabricated  metal. \nAppendix 2 provides a more detailed sector profile, including geographic distribution of SMEs, \nsector performance, and presence of female workers in SMEs. \n \n7. \nObtaining accurate data on the SME sector is difficult as many industrial establishments \nare  unregistered  or  unlicensed.4   Data  provided  by  MIME  show  that  of  the  18,639  small  rice-\nmilling enterprises, almost 10,000 are unregistered or unlicensed. Including the rice-millers, food \nprocessors  account  for  80%  of  the  21,568  small  enterprises.  More  than  11,000  do  not  have \noperating  permits.  Of  the  1,417  small  textile  and  garment  enterprises,  more  than  90%  do  not \nhave operating licenses.5  \n                                                 \n1   Cambodia has achieved rates of inflation well below 4% since 1999. The exchange rate remained broadly stable at \n\naround KR4,000 per dollar in 2003, with inflation averaging only 1.2%.   \n\n2   Currently  at  least  seven  major  legal  documents  are  being  considered  by  the  Government,  including  laws  on  (i) \ncommercial  enterprise,  (ii)  contracts,  (iii)  insolvency,  (iv)  secured  transactions,  (v)  civil  code  and  procedures,  (vi) \ncommercial arbitration, and (vii) commercial court. \n\n3   MIME carries out an annual survey of industrial enterprises through its provincial-municipal departments. \n4   Currently, the Government has no official definition of SMEs. The draft Law on Factory Management, for example, \ncategorizes  SMEs  as  those  with  registered  capital  of  less  than  $1  million,  while  other  ministries  have  a  working \ndefinition of SMEs based on number of employees. \n\n5   Just over 1% of the total number of industrial enterprises in Cambodia are estimated to have registered, and thus \n\ncan be considered part of the formal sector. \n\n2\n\n \n\n\f \n\n3 \n\n \n8. \nIn sum, the SME sector can be generally profiled as largely informal and most active in \nthe  agriculture  sector.  However,  based  on  data  provided  by  MIME,  the  importance  of  the \nmanufacturing sector is rising, as well as growth of medium-size enterprises (those with from 30 \nto  100  employees).  Given  the  importance  of  SMEs  to  the  economy,  significant  reforms  are \nneeded to ensure that the sector can achieve the Government's goals for economic growth and \npoverty reduction.  \n \nTo better identify the major challenges, and to define priorities in relation to SMEs, the \n9. \nprogram  preparatory  TA 6  prepared  a  comprehensive  SME  development  framework.  The \nframework  entails  a  6-year  development  plan,  which  addresses  several  important  issues \nincluding  business  regulations  and  SME  access  to  finance.  In  preparing  the  framework,  a \nnumber  of  surveys  were  reviewed,  and  a  series  of  discussions  were  held  with  SMEs,  private \nsector  representatives,  Government  officials,  and  other  stakeholders  to  understand  their \nperception  of  the  major  priorities  for  the  sector.7 A  comprehensive  review  was  undertaken  to \nanalyze  the  status  of  current  reforms  and  major  development  plans  of  the  Government;  and \ndevelopment agency activities were studied to avoid overlaps and identify synergies.  \n \n10. \nIn  addition  to  numerous  roundtable  discussions  with  Government  agencies,  the \nframework  was  presented  to  the  private  sector  and  to  development  agencies  active  in  SME \ndevelopment  in  a  series  of  workshops  held  between  July  and  September  2004  in  various \nlocations  in  Cambodia.  Participants\u2019  feedback  and  comments  were  incorporated  into  the  final \ndraft  of  the  SME  development  framework.  The  framework,  with  its  comprehensive  policy \nrecommendations  for  SME  development,  is  expected  to  be  the  basis  for  the  midterm, \ninterministerial framework for SME development to be adopted by the Government.  \n \nB. \n\nIssues and Opportunities \n\n1.  \n\nGovernment Objectives and Strategy \n\n11. \nThe  significance  of  the  domestic  private  (mostly  SME)  sector  is  clearly  indicated  in  the \noverall policy agenda of Cambodia. The Government issued its Second 5-Year Socio-Economic \nDevelopment  Plan  (2001\u20132005)  and  the  National  Poverty  Reduction  Strategy  in  2001.  Both \ndemonstrate  a  commitment  to  developing  the  (private)  sector. 8 In  recognition  of  the  sector\u2019s \nimportance, the Government established the Department of Small Industry and Handicraft within \n\n                                                 \n6   Asian  Development  Bank.  2003.

Manila (approved in September 2003, for $500,000). \n\n7  An  important  preparatory  analysis  is  provided  by  Asian  Development  Bank.  2002.  Technical  Assistance  to  the \nKingdom  of  Cambodia  for  Preparing  a  Private  Sector  Assessment.  Manila  (approved  in  December  2002  for \n$150,000). \n\nin  generating  household \n\n8   The Second 5-Year Socioeconomic Development Plan emphasizes the crucial role SMEs play, especially those in \nmanufacturing  and  processing, \nincomes  and  providing  additional  employment \nopportunities  for  people  in  rural  areas.  The  plan  notes  that  effective  development  of  SMEs  requires  a  strong \nemphasis  on  upgrading  enterprises  and  continuously  enhancing  SME  productive  capacity  to  ensure  that  they \ngraduate into the formal sector and improve access to credit. The plan also notes that private sector development \nis  largely  dependent  on  sustained  improvements  in  the  governance  environment,  and  that  improving  the  legal \nframework for commercial transactions and strengthening the judiciary are key factors in determining whether the \nprivate  sector  will  successfully  lead  the  economy  forward.  The  National  Poverty  Reduction  Strategy  identifies  the \nprivate sector as playing the leading role in poverty reduction and emphasizes the Government\u2019s role in creating a \nstable  macroeconomic  environment  through  policies  to  create  a  sound  financial  system,  improve  the  investment \nclimate,  and  implement  legal  and  judicial  reforms.  In  the  strategy,  the  Government  recognizes  that  the  private \nsector needs a more competitive environment in which to operate and that governance reforms are needed.  \n\n \n\n\f4\n\n \n\nis  one  of \n\nthree  subcommittees  established  under \n\nMIME in 2002, making it the first Cambodian agency dedicated solely to addressing SME-specific \nproblems.  \n \n12. \nThe  Government's  commitment  to  SME  development  is  reinforced  by  the  recent \nannouncement  of  the  Rectangular  Strategy,  which  includes  the  creation  of  National  SME \nSubcommittee to oversee policy formulation and implementation for the sector.9 At the core of \nthis  strategy  is  good  governance.  Within  this  framework,  one  of  the  four  strategic  sides  of  the \nrectangle is identified as private sector development and employment generation. This in turn is \nbroken down into four components: (i) strengthening the private sector and attracting investment, \n(ii) creating jobs and improving working conditions, (iii) promoting SMEs, and (iv) ensuring social \nsafety  nets.  SME  sector  development  is  prominent  in  the  strategy,  and  the  subcommittee, \ncomprising  relevant  Government  agencies  and  private  sector  representatives,  is  to  formulate \nand  implement  a  more  detailed  framework  for  SME  development.    The  National  SME \nSubcommittee \nthe  Private  Sector \nDevelopment Steering Committee, the other two addressing (i) private sector development and \nparticipation in infrastructure, and (ii) trade facilitation.  \n \n13. \nIn addition, the Government recognizes that weak governance holds back private sector \ndevelopment  by  deterring  investment,  which,  in  turn,  reduces  opportunities  for  income  and \nemployment  growth.  In  2001  the  Government  issued  its  Governance  Action  Plan,  which  is  a \nstrategy to implement judicial and legal reforms, improve public administration and finance, and \ncombat  corruption.  This  is  complemented  by  the  recent  efforts  of  the  Public  Financial \nManagement  Program  (PFM).  Under  the  PFM,  the  Government  has  committed  to  a  series  of \nreforms  to  not  only  enhance  its  fiscal  management,  but  also  promote  good  governance  and \naccountability  of  the  public  sector.  In  addition,  the  PFM  has  many  provisions  for  legal  reform, \ninstitutional  development,  and  capacity  building,  as  well  as  civil  service  reforms  to  enhance \nimplementation at both central and local levels.  \n \nThe PFM is closely linked with ongoing reform of the legal system. Supported by eight \n14. \ndevelopment  agencies,  including  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB),  the  Government  is \npreparing the short- and medium-term plan of action for legal and judicial reform. In addition to \nestablishing a modernized court system, the plan also aims to provide better information to the \npublic  on  various  legal  and  governmental  issues.  Combined  with  the  PFM  and  Governance \nAction  Plan,  and  as  reflected  in  the  Program  component  on  business  regulations,  the \nGovernment  emphasizes  the  need  to  develop  a  more  transparent  and  enabling  governance \nstructure. Finally, as part of the requirements for entering the World Trade Organization (WTO), \nthe Government has agreed to reform the commercial legal framework to improve the business \nenvironment for SMEs and the private sector.  \n \n\nChallenges \n\n2. \n \n\n15.  Many  enterprises  (and  particularly  smaller  enterprises)  still  face  major  barriers, \nparticularly the high costs of regulatory compliance, high level of informality, and limited access \nto  key  inputs  and  markets.  The  current  shortcomings  of  the  legal  and  regulatory  environment \nnot  only  increase  the  cost  of  doing  business,  but  also  limit  SMEs'  access  to  key  inputs  for \ngrowth, such as finance. Although banking in Cambodia is still in the developing stages, it has \nexcess  liquidity\u2014meaning  that  SMEs'  limited  access  to  finance  is  partially  the  result  of  the \ncurrently risky lending environment. While the high level of foreign investments during the late \n\n                                                 \n9 The  Rectangular  Strategy  was  announced  by  the  Prime  Minister  during  the  first  Cabinet  meeting  of  the  Third \n\nLegislature of the National Assembly at the Office of Council of Ministers (July 2004).   \n\n \n\n\f \n\n5 \n\n1990s  has  fuelled  economic  growth\u2014as  indicated  by  the  increasing  number  of  medium-size \nenterprises\u2014the  Government  needs  to  formulate  and  implement  a  coordinated  development \nstrategy aimed at fostering a more conducive business environment for SMEs. A discussion of \nsome of the major challenges follows. \n \n\na. \n\nSME Development Framework  \n\n16. \nAlthough  the  Government  recognizes  the  need  to  develop  a  supportive  regulatory \nenvironment,  it  lacks  a  coordinated  framework  to  implement  the  necessary  policy  actions. \nIndividual  ministries  continue  to  have  their  own,  uncoordinated  approaches  to  SME/business \ndevelopment. Little information exists on the industry structure, and few channels are available \nfor communicating and disseminating existing information.  \n \n\ni. \n\nSME Development Policy \n\n17. \nOnly  limited  mechanisms  are  available  to  coordinate  development  of  a  cohesive \ngovernment-wide  policy  direction  for  SME  development.  The  Rectangular  Strategy  is  a  broad \ndocument that requires a more in-depth, implementation framework. Without such a framework, \nany  approach  to  the  sector  will  not  identify  the  major  priorities  or  address  them  in  a \ncomprehensive, well-sequenced, and coordinated manner.  \n \n\nii. \n\nInstitutional Arrangements for SME Development \n\n18. \nEven  with  adoption  of  an  enabling  SME  development  framework,  considerable  efforts \nare  needed  to  ensure  that  it  is  effectively  implemented.  Implementation  requires  institutional \narrangements  that  facilitate  a  continuous  flow  of  information  to  disseminate  the  framework's \nstrategic direction as well as monitor its progress and effectiveness. In particular, the following \nactions are needed: (i) collect information on the  business sector (including SMEs) as a basis \nfor  a  more  effective  framework  evaluation, 10  (ii)  make  information  available  to  SMEs  on \ngovernment  regulations  and  programs,  and  (iii)  expand  opportunities  for  public  participation  in \npolicy formulation.  \n \n\nb. \n\nBusiness Regulations \n\n19. \nA  major  constraint  to  development  of  the  private  sector  and  particularly  SMEs  is  the \nuncertainty  and  lack  of  transparency  in  the  current  regulatory  regime\u2014which  adds  to  the \nenterprises\u2019 costs of doing business. The Program emphasizes reform of regulations relating to \n(i) business registration, (ii) business operating licenses, and (iii) various regulatory licenses.11 \nAll  enterprises  are  affected,  but  regulations  regarding  business  registration  would  have  the \ngreatest impact on medium-size firms, while business operating licenses are more important for \n\n                                                 \n10 One of the key practical barriers to the collection of information on the sector is the lack of the formal definition of \nSMEs. A definition needs to be established for the purpose of information and statistics collection by the National \nInstitute of Statistics and other relevant agencies.  \n\n11  These  regulatory  tools  allow  the  Government  to  impact  the  market  entry  and  operations  of  all  enterprises.  The \nmain  differences  among  them  should  be  clarified:  in  the  case  of  business  registration,  certification  allows  the \nenterprises to become legal entities; in the case of business operating license, certification allows the enterprises \nto conduct their businesses in the specified industry; and finally, the regulatory licenses allow the Government to \nregulate enterprises on diverse issues to ensure that all relevant laws are complied  with. Examples include labor \nsafety, sanitation, and environmental protection. Thus, a registered company would be required to adhere to both \noperating  and  regulatory  license  requirements;  businesses  with  only  operating  licenses  will  also  be  required  to \nadhere to regulatory licenses, but they are excluded from the formal tax regime.  \n\n \n\n\f6\n\n \n\nsmaller  enterprises.  Both  large  and  small  enterprises  are  heavily  impacted  by  the  various \nregulatory licenses.  \n \n\ni. \n\nBusiness Registration System  \n\nAlthough  the  decision  to  register12 should  be  at  the  discretion  of  each  enterprise,  the \n20. \ndifficulties  of  registering  have  important  implications.  Under  the  current  legal  framework, \nunregistered  enterprises  (i)  cannot  engage  in  foreign  trade;  (ii)  cannot  obtain  various  tax \nbenefits;  (iii)  cannot  secure  their  assets  in  public  registries,  which  are  being  developed  in \nCambodia;  (iv)  cannot  engage  in  legally  protected  commercial  contracts  in  the  name  of  the \nenterprise as a legal entity; (v) do not qualify for government procurement; (vi) have no legally \nprotected rights of shareholders; or (vii) cannot seek protection through corporate bankruptcy. In \naddition,  although  unregistered  enterprises  are  not  explicitly  excluded,  they  are  also  likely  to \nhave  difficulties  with  (i)  engaging  in  subcontracting  with  foreign  enterprises;  (ii)  validating \ncommercial  contracts  through  the  corporate  entity;  and  (iii)  obtaining  loans  from  banks,  which \nusually  prefer  to  lend  to  registered  companies.  Finally,  the  barriers  against  registration  also \ndiscourage  enterprises  from  incorporating  themselves  as  limited  liability  companies\u2014meaning \nthat  the  owners  assume  all  the  risks  associated  with  the  enterprise  activities,  as  no  legal \nseparation exists between the owner(s) and the enterprise.  \n \nThe  major  impediments  to  business  registration  are  as  follows.  First,  the  costs  of \n21. \nregistration  are  currently  about  $1,200  to  $1,500  (four  to  five  times  per  capita  GDP)  and  the \nhighest  in  the  Mekong  region.13 Second,  the  approximately  17  processes  and  documentation \nrequirements  involve  various  local  and  central  government  agencies.14 Third,  enterprises  must \nregister  at  the  Ministry  of  Commerce  (MOC)  building  in  Phnom  Penh.  Entrepreneurs  must \ntherefore  travel  to  Phnom  Penh,  often  several  times,  to  register  their  enterprises.  Fourth,  the \nminimum  capital  requirement  for  business  registration  is  set  at  $5,000  (about  16  times \nCambodia's  per  capita  GDP)  and  is  higher  than  in  neighboring  countries.  The  requirement  is \nbased  solely  on  cash  deposits  at  a  commercial  bank  and,  accordingly,  takes  no  account  of \nassets  that  a  company  may  have.  Finally,  for  the  Government,  lack  of  information  technology \nprecludes an efficient registration system and effective storage of data.  \n \n\nii. \n\nBusiness Operating and Regulatory Licensing System \n\n22. \nAlthough  most  countries  commonly  have  several  agencies  that  issue  specific  business \nlicenses, Cambodia currently lacks a systematic approach to limit the burden on enterprises. On \naverage, Cambodian firms are subject to more than 16 license inspections per year. In addition, \nbusiness-operating licenses need to be renewed on a continual basis. The formal and informal \npayments  for  obtaining  both  operating  and  regulatory  licenses  add  substantially  to  the  cost  of \ndoing business\u2014particularly for SMEs.  \n \n23. \nThe  major  challenges  include  the  following.  First,  transparency  is  lacking  in  licensing \nprocedures,  related  costs,  and  requirements  for  inspection.  This  can  lead  to  confusion  and \nabuse  by  local  officials.  No  information  window  is  available  to  provide  central  access  to  such \ninformation.  Second,  without  any  criteria  for  analyzing  whether  the  existing  regulatory  license \nrequirements  are  redundant,  no  mechanism  is  available  to  ensure  that  new  license \nrequirements  do  not  duplicate  existing  ones,  particularly  as  local  and  central  agencies  are \n\n                                                 \n12 Business registration refers to registration of various types of businesses as well as company incorporation. \n13  The average for the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, Thailand, and Viet Nam is about $120. \n14  In comparison, Viet Nam has six requirements. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n7 \n\nresponsible for their own licensing and inspection procedures, and coordination between central \nand  local  authorities  is  limited.  Third,  particularly  for  operating  licenses,  no  clear  criteria \nestablish a fair and effective process for issuance for various sectors. The agencies are able to \nimplement  licensing  and  inspection  procedures  without  any  formal  review  of  the  necessity, \neconomic  impacts,  or  justification  of  the  regulations.  Some  agencies  and  officials  lack \naccountability, as licensing authorities are not required to justify their activities on the grounds of \npublic  safety,  health,  or  for  quality  assurance  purposes.  Finally,  enterprises  have  no  formal \nmechanism  to  request  a  reevaluation  of  the  inspections,  and  thus  may  experience  arbitrary \nlicense issuances/inspections.  \n \n\nc. \n\nAccess to Finance \n\nAs of the end of 2003, bank loans to the private sector were 6.9% of GDP\u2014one of the \n24. \nlowest  rates  of  banking  intermediation  in  the  world.  A  study  on  SMEs  by  the  Mekong  Private \nSector  Development  Facility  (MPDF)  in  November  2000  found  that  over  60%  of  respondents \nconsidered lack of working capital to be a major problem\u201470% of the firms needed long-term \nloans. A May 2003 MPDF study on bank financing for SMEs identified almost total absence of \nmedium- and long-term lending (less than 2% of SME loans were for more than 2 years).  \n \n25. \nSeveral  factors  have  resulted  in  this  high  risk-lending  environment.  One  is  the  lack  of \ncollateral  and  contract  enforcement  by  the  courts.  This  means  that  commercial  banks  must \nassume a considerable risk in lending to SMEs, which are usually less known and established \nthan  larger  businesses.  With  ADB  assistance,  the  Government  is  developing  a  legal  and \ninstitutional  framework  for  secured  transactions  for  movable  properties.  ADB  and  the  World \nBank  are  also  working  with  the  Government  on  the  Land  Law  and  registration  of  land  as \nimmovable  properties.  Furthermore,  as  part  of  the  WTO  accession  requirement,  a  number  of \ndevelopment  agencies  are  supporting  the  Government  with  contract  enforcement,  and \nestablishing and building the capacity of a commercial court. \n \n26. \nThree  important  barriers  block  SME  access  to  finance.  The  first  is  the  lack  of  a  credit \ninformation system, which heightens commercial banks' risks in lending. The second relates to \nthe  underdeveloped  accounting  and  taxation  systems,  which  deter  SMEs  from  providing \nsufficient  financial  information  to  the  commercial  banks.  Finally,  Cambodia  has  no  nonbank \nfinancial institutions to provide finance to SMEs.  \n \n\ni. \n\nCredit Information  \n\n27. \nNo  system  currently  exists  to  collect  credit  information  on  borrowers  in  Cambodia.  In \nmany developed financial systems, credit information bureaus provide information on potential \nborrowers, this helps reduce risks and transaction costs. Banks use collateral as one method to \nreduce this risk, but the effectiveness of this is constrained by SMEs\u2019 lack of significant assets, \nand  by  difficulties  in  securing  their  assets,  particularly  land/buildings.  Although  NBC  and  the \nAssociation  of  Banks  in  Cambodia  (ABC)  indicated  a  clear  need  to  establish  such  a  system, \nprogress has been limited.  \n \n\nii. \n\nAccounting Standards and Taxation System \n\n28. \nThe  high-risk  lending  environment  is  reinforced  by  the  lack  of  financial  statements  for \nmost  small  enterprises;  therefore  lenders  have  difficulty  obtaining  an  accurate  picture  of  their \nfinancial  position.  Although  the  Government  has  made  considerable  progress  with  the  recent \npromulgation  of  the  Accounting  Law  and  the  establishment  of  the  Cambodian  Accounting \n\n \n\n\f8\n\n \n\nStandards  in  2003,  the  accounting  system  is  overly  complicated  for  use  by  SMEs.  Without an \nunderstanding of accounting procedures, the SMEs are often unable to provide necessary and \nreliable information as required by the commercial banks. With the limitations many SMEs face \nin  providing  collateral  for  loans,  this  becomes  a  significant  barrier.  Furthermore,  many  of  the \nissued accounting standards are not relevant to SMEs and their less complex financial situation. \nThus,  a  systematic  approach  is  needed  to  disseminate  information  on  the  accounting  system \nand train SMEs in its use (as well as providing SMEs with simplified guidelines and templates), \nfocusing  on  their  appropriate  needs.  Another  important  barrier  associated  with  the  lack  of \nfinancial  information  is  the  complexity  of  the  current,  formal  tax  system,  which  often  provides \nverification  on  the  financial  statements  of  (larger)  SMEs.  Unfamiliarity  with  the  filing  system \nleads to uncertainty, which leads to increased costs for the SMEs (as about $500 is needed to \nhire a tax facilitator/accountant in Cambodia). While considerable efforts are currently ongoing \nwith the PFM Working Group (co-chaired by the International Monetary Fund and ADB), these \nefforts need to be complemented by reductions of the barriers faced by SMEs dealing with the \ntaxation system.  \n \n\niii. \n\nNonbanking Financial Institutions (Leasing) \n\n29. \nCurrently, the loans from commercial banks (and some lending by licensed microfinance \ninstitutions) are the only source of formal finance for SMEs, but these funds are generally short-\nterm  (less  than  1  year).  Internationally,  and  particularly  in  developing  countries,  leasing  has \nbecome  an  important  source  of  SME  financing,  but  the  lack  of  a  legal  framework  has  been  a \nmajor  obstacle  to  the  development  of  leasing  in  Cambodia.  For  SMEs,  leasing  offers  an \nalternative form of finance whereby a lessor relies on its ownership of the leased asset and the \nlessee's  cash  flow  to  service  the  lease  payments.  The  benefits  of  leasing  include  simpler \nsecurity arrangements and fewer requirements for historical financial information. However, for \nleasing  to  develop,  the  lessor  must  be  able  to  legally  exercise  ownership  rights  quickly  and \neffectively when any default occurs. With the recent actions to develop the secured transactions \nand  commercial  court  system,  the  timing  would  be  appropriate  for  formulating  the  legal \nframework to create an enabling environment for leasing industry development. \n \n\n3.  \n\nADB's Strategy and Operations in the Sector \n\n30. \nADB\u2019s  current  country  strategy  and  program  update  (2002\u20132004)  for  Cambodia \nreiterates  the  importance  of  achieving  sustainable  growth  for  realizing  the  overarching  goal  of \npoverty reduction.15 The strategic focus includes (i) fostering broad-based economic growth, (ii) \nreducing  vulnerability,  and  (iii)  strengthening  governance  for  development.  Private  sector \ndevelopment is recognized as one of the pillars to achieve the goal of economic growth, with an \nemphasis  on  governance  reforms.  Toward  this  end,  ADB\u2019s  ongoing  and  programmed \ninterventions  will  address  key \nto  growth,  human  resource \ndevelopment by promoting education and health, and financial sector development. In designing \nthe  Program,  governance  reform,  particularly  for  the  business  regulatory  environment,  and \ninstitutional arrangements needed for growth, ranging from an SME development framework to \na credit information system, have been emphasized.  \n \n31. \nThe Program has linkages with a number of current ADB projects. Most importantly, the \nProgram  components  to  enhance  access  to  finance  are  closely  linked  with  the  ongoing \nFinancial Sector Program Loan (FSPL).16 The FSPL has supported development of accounting \n\ninfrastructure  bottlenecks \n\n                                                 \n15  ADB. 2002.

In addition, the Financial Sector \nBlueprint\u2014a  comprehensive  10-year  development  plan\u2014was  prepared  with  ADB  support  and \nwas  officially  adopted  by  the  Government  in  2001.  The  Government  is  currently  planning  to \nupdate the blueprint. Financing for the FSPL is provided as a cluster loan, and although some \ndelays in implementation occurred due to the political situation in 2003\u20132004, the Government \nhas been able to undertake the FSPL's reforms without significant changes for the latter parts of \nthe  subprograms.  Currently,  with  the  second  of  three  subprograms  almost  completed,  the \nGovernment  has  made  substantial  progress  in  promoting  the  financial  sector,  including  (i) \nenhancing  the  bank  supervision  framework;  (ii)  establishing  and  engaging  in  capacity-building \nefforts of the bankers' association; and (iii) developing financial infrastructure, including secured \ntransactions system and uniform chart of accounts.  \n \n32. \nThe  Program's  efforts  to  promote  good  governance  and  effective  decentralization  (for \nbusiness  registration)  also  aim  to  complement  the  ongoing  and  planned  activities  to  support \npublic administration reform and capacity building of local government authorities.17 As much of \nthe  Cambodian  economy  is  rural-based,  the  Program  is  also  linked  with  two  agriculture/rural-\noriented projects. The Agriculture Sector Development Program Loan18 aims to improve access \nto  productive  resources  and  inputs  through  reform  of  the  regulatory  system,  while  the  Rural \nCredit and Savings Project19 provided a credit line to microfinance institutions and supported the \nregulatory/licensing  scheme  of  those  institutions.  Through  the  components  on  business \nregulatory  reform,  the  Program  reinforces  the  aims  of  these  projects  to  develop  an  enabling \nregulatory system for the private sector. Finally, the Program's support for the SME sector will \nprovide  linkages  to  the  planned  activities  to  promote  trade  and  investment  in  Cambodia  and \nwithin the Greater Mekong Subregion.  \n \n\n4. \n\nExternal Assistance to the Sector \n\nSeveral  other  development  activities  are  related  to  SMEs.20 ADB  and  the  World  Bank \n33. \nconducted studies to assess major issues facing the private sector in Cambodia. These studies \nfocused on the need for legal and regulatory reforms to improve the business environment and \nenhance  the  competitiveness  of  the  private  sector.  The  International  Finance  Corporation \nprovides  the  secretariat  for  the  Private  Sector  Forum  and  facilitates  meetings  of  the  seven \nworking groups. Through this forum, the private sector has been given a stronger ability to voice \nits  concerns  about  the  business  environment.  Other  development  support  has  focused  on \ndeveloping the legal framework for business. The Japan International Cooperation Agency has \nbeen involved in developing the commercial legal framework through its support to develop the \nCivil Code and Code of Civil Procedure.  \n \n34. \nOther indirect support for the SME sector includes European Commission support to the \nrural sector, which focused mainly on agricultural production, but also carried out assessments \nof the agro-industrial situation, an area of great importance to Cambodian SMEs. The European \nCommission  is  also  providing  support  for  WTO  accession  in  the  areas  of  institutional  support \nand  trade  facilitation  and  diversification.  More  direct  support  for  SME  development  has  come \nfrom  United  States  Agency  for  International  Development  to  fund  programs  to  enhance  the \n\n                                                 \n17 ADB.  2002.

The  Australian  Agency  for  International \nDevelopment has also provided assistance to build capacity of rice-millers associations and to \nsupport  the  diversification  of  seed  varieties  to  improve  the  quality  of  milled  rice  as  part  of  its \nAgriculture  Quality  Improvement  Project.  The  Gesellschaft  f\u00fcr  Technische  Zusammenarbeit  of \nGermany  provides  support  for  vocational  training  and  trade  promotion  to  support  the \ndevelopment of rural enterprises, and is currently planning its Private Sector Promotion Program \nfor  Cambodia  to  commence  in  2005.  This  program  is  likely  to  provide  direct  support  to  SMEs \nthrough  enterprise-centered  promotion  and  support  for  enterprise  networking.  The  United \nNations Industrial Development Organization is supporting MIME to develop industrial standards \nin product areas affecting Cambodian SMEs, particularly in agro-processing.  \n \n35.  MPDF is the main provider of direct support to SMEs in Cambodia. It provides financial, \nmarketing,  and  other  related  advice  to  SMEs;  and  capacity  building  to  financial  institutions  to \nfacilitate  increased  financing  to  SMEs.  MPDF  also  provides  capacity  building  to  business \nassociations  and  management  training  to  SMEs.  Through  its  business  enabling  environment \nprogram, MPDF supports research on issues affecting SMEs, such as access to financing and \nin areas of governance and reform.   \n \n36. \nDevelopment agencies are in the process of providing or planning to provide a number \nof credit lines. Agence Fran\u00e7aise  de  D\u00e9veloppement has  a credit line of \u20ac3.8  million  available \nuntil the end of 2004 for direct lending to microfinance institutions. Kreditanstalt Wiederaufbau of \nGermany initiated an SME financing project from the start of 2004, with a loan of \u20ac2.5 million to \nCanadia  Bank.  United  States  Agency  for  International  Development  is  planning  a  $5  million \npartial credit guarantee scheme to Canadia Bank for loans to SMEs. Furthermore, Acleda Bank \nis seeking credit lines of $10 million in 2004 from offshore sources to fund increases in the loan \nportfolio.21 \n \n37. \nTo improve access to credit by providing funds, about 90 nongovernment organizations \n(NGOs)  operate  rural  credit  facilities.  Most  clients  are  poor  households  in  rural  areas.  These \nNGOs  provide  loans  to  poor  people  of  the  same  occupation  or  type  of  business.  Loans  are \nusually  provided  on  a  6-month  cycle  and  mostly  used  for  activities  related  to  agriculture  and \nagro-based  businesses.  Loans \nthe  borrowers\u2019 \nperformance  with  their  first-cycle  loans.  Smaller  credit  operating  NGOs  have  compulsory \nsavings  requirements,  where  group  members  control  their  savings  and  use  these  savings  for \nlending among themselves.   \n \nIn  sum,  the  Program  is  to  seek  synergy  with  the  Government  strategies  and \n38. \ndevelopment  activities  (most  of  which  are  recently  formulated),  especially  those  related  to \ndevelopment  of  a  legal  and  regulatory  environment,  including  the  necessary  institutions.  The \nProgram  also  aims  to  complement  current  projects  aiming  to  provide  financial  resources  to \nSMEs  and  micro-enterprises.  Accordingly,  many  of  the  alternative  assistance  modalities, \nespecially  credit  lines  for  SMEs,  have  not  been  included  in  the  Program  to  avoid  overlap  with \nother development agency (and NGO) activities. \n \n\nindividuals  are  provided  based  on \n\nfor \n\n5. \n\nLessons Learned \n\nA  number  of  important  lessons  can  be  learned  from  ADB's  past  operations  in  SME \n\n39. \ndevelopment. The following lessons are particularly relevant for Cambodia:  \n \n\n                                                 \n21  Acleda Bank is a microfinance institution which has been increasing its lending to micro- and small-enterprises. \n\n \n\n\f11 \n\n \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\nFor  program  loans,  the  commitment  of  the  developing  member  country \ngovernment  is  crucial  for  successful  outcomes.  Specific  attention  also  needs  to \nbe  paid  to  implementation  aspects  of  program  loans.  Accordingly,  capacity-\nbuilding measures through TA and regular dialogue remain critical.  \n\nPrograms need to develop close linkage and synergy with other related projects \nto have a more sustainable effect. Because the SME sector represents much of \nthe  private  sector  in  many  developing  member  countries,  one  program/project \nwill have difficulty undertaking all the necessary reforms.  \n\n \n40. \nDistinct features of the Program include the consultative approach taken throughout its \nformulation.  A  series  of  workshops was  organized  for  each  component  with  a  view  to  achieve \nthe commitment of Government and stakeholders. An advisory TA will be provided for capacity \nbuilding  and  support  for  program  implementation.  Furthermore,  the  Program  is  designed  to \nmaximize linkage with projects from ADB and other development agencies.  \n\nIV. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROGRAM \n\n \n\nA. \n\nObjective and Scope \n\nThe  overall  objective  of  the  Program  is  to  lay  the  foundation  for  development  of  a \n41. \nbusiness  environment  conducive  to  sustainable  economic  growth  and  poverty  reduction.  This \nobjective will be achieved by (i) establishing an SME development framework, (ii) implementing \nreforms of governance and business regulations; and (iii) improving SME access to finance. The \nProgram\u2019s emphasis on the need to reduce the costs of doing business can be achieved with \nclose coordination among key Government agencies. To facilitate the coordination process, an \ninter-ministerial coordination body will be established to lay the foundation for the Government's \nstrategy  on  SME  development.  The  Program  also  includes  several  policy  actions  to  improve \nSMEs'  access  to  finance\u2014mostly  aiming  to  reduce  risks  associated  with  the  current  lending \nenvironment. \n \n42. \nDeveloping  an  enabling  business  environment  is  particularly  relevant  for  Cambodia, \nwhere significant institutional and legislative components are missing or poorly developed, and \nSMEs  operate  mostly  in  the  informal  sector.  The  components,  both  legal  and  institutional, \nessential for an efficient economy need to be established. Through the analysis of the program \npreparatory TA, and based on dialogue with the Government and other stakeholders, the issues \nselected  for  support  under  the  Program  were  determined  by  (i)  their  contribution  to  improving \nthe  business  environment;  (ii)  the  perceived  commitment  of  the  Government  to  required \nreforms;  (iii)  ADB's  past  and  ongoing  operations  in  Cambodia;  and  (iv)  the  Program\u2019s \ncomplementarities with other development agency activities. \n \nB. \n\nPolicy Framework and Actions \n\nThe overall policy framework and specific policy actions include the following: \n\n43. \n \n\n(i) \n\nThe policy framework and actions will aim to foster a more coordinated approach \nto  enterprise  (and  particularly  SME)  development  by  the  Government.  This \nincludes  (a)  establishing  a  National  SME  Subcommittee  (according  to  the \n(b)  adopting  and \nRectangular  Strategy)  with  a  permanent  secretariat; \nimplementing  an  SME  development  framework\u2014intended  as  a  midterm,  inter-\nministerial  policy  agenda  to  support  SMEs,  with  developing  an  enabling \n\n \n\n\f12\n\n \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\nenvironment  as  the  priority;  and  (c)  developing  institutions  to  ensure  increased \nflow of information to businesses in particular SMEs, and  to seek closer public-\nprivate partnership.  \n\nA  set  of  measures  for  reducing  the  costs  of  doing  business  will  enhance  the \nGovernment's  transparency  and  governance.  Components  include  (a)  directly \nreducing  the  costs  and  removing  unnecessary  requirements  for  both  business \nregistration and business operating and regulatory licenses; (b) installing a one-\nstop  information  system  that  provides  information  on  relevant  regulations  for \nSMEs,  as  well  as  a  recourse  mechanism  to  track  and  resolve  complaints  on \nregulations \nfrom  enterprises;  and  (c)  promoting  effective  decentralization \ncombined with enhanced accountability of Government agencies.  \n\nSeveral  actions  will  improve  SME  access  to  finance,  including  the  development \nof  (a)  a  credit  information  system  to  reduce  the  transaction  costs  and  risks \nassociated  with  SME  lending;  (b)  SME  accounting  guidelines,  including  a \nsimplified  taxation  filing  system,  to  help  SMEs  maintain  and  provide  better \nfinancial  information;  and  (c)  a  legal  framework  to  provide  the  basis  for \nestablishing a leasing industry in Cambodia.  \n\n \nThese measures are intended to reduce the costs and risks associated with doing business in \nCambodia.  Reforms  to  be  supported  by  the  Program  are  presented  in  the  policy  matrix  in \nAppendix 4. The development policy letter is in Appendix 5 and the sector strategy in Appendix \n6. A detailed discussion follows.  \n  \n\n1. \n\nEstablish a Coordinated Approach to SME Development  \n\n44. \nThe  Program  includes  the  formulation  of  an  SME  development  framework,  and  the \nestablishment of an effective inter-ministerial coordination body (National SME Subcommittee). \nThe  framework  provides  a  6-year  policy  agenda  on  SME  development,  and  establishes  the \nGovernment's  primary  policy  direction  as  developing  an  enabling  business  environment,  to  be \nimplemented  by  various  agencies.  Provisions  will  also  be  developed  to  promote  public-private \npartnership, including the promotion of business associations. The National SME Subcommittee \nwill  coordinate  framework  activities.  The  committee\u2019s  establishment  marks  the  first  inter-\nministerial body in Cambodia to formulate and implement a set of policies on the SME sector.   \n \n\na. \n\nFormulate the SME Development Framework \n\n45. \nThe  main  focus  of  the  SME  development  framework  will  be  developing  a  market-\noriented  business  environment;  it  aims  to  be  a  conduit  for  policy  coordination  among \nGovernment  agencies.  Several  ministries  are  concerned  with  ensuring  SMEs  conform  to \nregulatory requirements, while others are more directly concerned with promoting the welfare of \nworkers and small-scale entrepreneurs. Such diverse interests across many ministries have led \nto  a  variety  of  approaches,  initiatives,  and  regulations  dealing  with  SMEs.  Until  now,  the \nGovernment  has  made  little  effort  to  coordinate  or  develop  a  strategic  approach  for  SME \ndevelopment.  The  great  variety  of  efforts  by  various  ministries  has  meant,  at  best, a  lack  of  a \ncoordinated effort for developing SMEs; at worst, it has resulted in conflicting signals to small-\nscale entrepreneurs and an increase in uncertainty. \n \n46. \nThe framework, to be formulated by the National SME Subcommittee and approved by \nthe Council of Ministers, will provide a sequenced set of specific policy goals to be achieved, as \n\n \n\n\f \n\n13 \n\nwell as identify the relevant Government agencies. The timetable for the framework is expected \nto be 6 years, with a review and evaluation to be initiated in the third year. Often, such broad \nplans  fail  to  materialize  due  to  limited  opportunities  for  impartial  review  of  progress.  The \nsequencing of the policy reforms as identified in the framework needs to be regularly adjusted \nbased  on  implementation  capacity,  as  well  as  to  accommodate  unexpected  changes  in  the \noverall macroeconomic environment. Where necessary, the framework will identify and plan for \ninstitutional  structures  and  capacity  building  within  the  Government  to  ensure  effective \nimplementation.   \n   \n\nb. \n\nDevelop Institutional Arrangements for the Framework \n\nthe  Government  has  recently  announced \n\n47.  With a primary objective to provide support for effective framework implementation, this \nthe \nactivity  has  several  components.  First, \nestablishment of a National SME Subcommittee, with responsibility for coordinating and policy \nformulation  for  SMEs.  The  subcommittee  will  have  high-level  representation  from  all  key \nagencies with significant interests related to SMEs, including the Ministry of Women's Affairs to \nensure that the framework is gender-responsive, as well as private sector representation. The \nsubcommittee is expected to be chaired by the MIME Minister. MIME will provide the secretariat.   \n \n48. \nTo formulate, implement, and evaluate a comprehensive SME development framework, \nthe  Government  needs  to  collect  more  comprehensive  information  on  enterprises  \u2013  which  in \nturn  lead  to  the  publication  of  the  annual  SME  sector  report  by  the  MIME  on  behalf  of  the \nsubcommittee.    The  report  is  to  cover:  (i)  status  of  the  SME  sector,  (ii)  the  Government's \nachievements in implementing the SME development framework, and (iii) goals for the coming \nyear.  It will be made available to the public, via posting on the MIME website, and will also be \nsubmitted  to  the  Council  of  Ministers  and  the  National  Assembly.    As  part  of  this  process, \nagreement will be reached on an official definition of SMEs. To ensure gender responsiveness, \ndata  collection  will  include  disaggregated  data  on  gender.  The  Government  is  to  develop \nmechanisms to gather more accurate information, and also provide information to entrepreneurs. \nThis  is  a  critical  element,  especially  for  evaluation  and  planning  for  the  next  sequence  of  the \nframework.  The  Government  will  establish  a  website  for  SMEs,  to  provide  information  on \nvarious  government  regulations  and  market \nlist  of  business \nassociations.22  \n \n\nincluding  a \n\ninformation, \n\n2. \n\nEnhance Governance and Business Regulations \n\nThe  Program  includes  several  reforms  to  enhance  public  governance  and  business \n49. \nregulations.  First,  is  reform  of  the  business  registration  system.  The  reforms  entail  reducing \ncosts  and  procedures/requirements,  enhancing  transparency,  and  decentralizing.  Second, \nspecific  measures  to  improve  the  current  operating  and  regulatory  licensing  systems  include \nidentifying and removing unnecessary licenses (and licensing requirements), developing criteria \nfor issuance of any new license requirements, and implementing mechanisms for enterprises to \nstate their grievances pertaining to administrative decisions concerning licensing and inspection. \nEnhanced transparency and accountability of Government agencies are critical for the success \nof these reforms, and related to the ongoing governance reforms. \n \n\n                                                 \n22 In  recognition  that  Internet  access  is  low  in  Cambodia,  the  Government  will  also  draft  a  plan  for  enhancing \n\ncoverage of information access for SMEs.  \n\n \n\n\f14\n\n \n\na. \n\nImprove the Business Registration Process \n\n50. \nThe  main  objective  is  to  reduce  the  barriers  and  enhance  the  transparency  associated \nwith business registration.  The proposed reform aims to induce a more developed commercial \nsystem  by  allowing  enterprises  to  enter  the  formal  sector  and,  in  the  case  of  incorporation, \nestablish legal entities as companies and protect the rights of the shareholders.  \n \n51.  MOC  will  undertake  several  components  for  registration  reform.  First,  the  Program \nincludes  activities  to  reduce  registration  procedures  and  documentation  requirements  of  both \ncentral and local governments. This is intended to make the Cambodian system consistent with \ninternational  experience.  As  specified  in  the  policy  matrix,  about  half  of  the  registration \nrequirements are to be removed as a result of the proposed reform. Second, the Program aims \nto  reduce  the  costs  associated  with  registration.  Based  on  the  reduction  of  the  current  costs \n(mostly  by  removing  unnecessary  requirements),  barriers  against  business  registration  will  be \nsignificantly reduced. Third, the Program includes  the development of  a pilot program that  will \npermit  provincial  registration.  Procedures  to  effectively  implement  this  decentralization  plan, \nwhich will be compatible with the provisions of the (draft) Law on Commercial Enterprises, will \nbe  developed.  Fourth,  the  Government  is  to  decrease  the  minimum  capital  requirement  for \nnewly  registering  enterprises.  The  current  $5,000  requirement  will  be  reduced  to  $1,000  by \namending  the  (draft)  Commercial  Enterprise  Law,  which  is  soon  to  be  promulgated  by  the \nNational Assembly.23 Fifth, the Program includes the introduction of an information technology-\nbased registration system. Enhanced transparency will result when the various procedures and \nrequirements  are  clarified  through  the  issuance  of  new  legal  documents.  An  effective \ninformation technology-based system should lead to eventual decentralization of the system.  \n \n\nb. \n\nDevelop a Transparent Business Licensing System \n\n52. \nThe main objective in business licensing reform is to reduce the costs of doing business \nin  Cambodia,  specifically  the  regulatory  compliance  costs.  Although  the  Government  must \nmaintain  an  effective  licensing/inspection  system,  it  should  not  be  overly  burdensome  for \nenterprises. Thus, the Program seeks to streamline current licensing (by eliminating duplicative \nlicenses  and/or  their  requirements)  and  ensure  that  new  licenses  to  be  required  will  not  be \nredundant.  Furthermore,  enterprises  should  be  given  the  right  to  ask  for  clarification  on  the \nprocess of licensing and inspections.  \n \n53. \nTo  achieve  this  task,  forming  an  inter-ministerial  body  will  be  important,  as  various \nministries  and  agencies  have  different  licensing  jurisdictions.  Accordingly,  the  National  SME \nSubcommittee  will  review  licenses  and  inspection  procedures  affecting  SMEs  and  make \nrecommendations for reforms to the Council of Ministers. As a first step, the subcommittee will \ninitiate the reform by identifying all major licenses (and their legal authorization) of the major line \nministries  affecting  SMEs.24 Then,  it  will  develop  criteria  on  current  licenses  to  streamline  the \nlicensing  process  and  requirements  deemed  to  be  unnecessary  or  overly  burdensome.  The \nsubcommittee will also develop a set of criteria for any new operating and regulatory licenses. \nThe  overall  aim  is  to  ensure  consistency  and  accountability  among  all  agencies  authorized  to \nissue licenses.  \n \n\n                                                 \n23 As  an  interim  measure,  MOC  issued  Announcement  No.  1962  MoC/M2004  on  the  Requirement  for  Minimum \n\nDeposit in the Bank for Registered Companies (August 2004), which reduces the amount to KR4 million. \n\n24  The  relevant  agencies  include  the  ministries  of  agriculture,  forestry,  and  fisheries;  commerce;  economy  and \n\nfinance; environment; industry, mines, and energy; and tourism. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n15 \n\nTo  improve  the  rights  of  businesses  to  file  grievances  against  officials  unfairly \n54. \nimplementing  laws  and  regulations,  a  plan  will  be  adopted  for  a  recourse  mechanism  that  (i) \nprovides a window for the private sector to report grievances regarding administrative decisions, \n(ii)  establishes  a  system  for  investigating  grievances,  and  (iii)  provides  a  mechanism  for \nresolving complaints. Accordingly, the National SME Subcommittee will oversee implementation \nof the plan to establish a recourse mechanism (which also tracks the records of complaints by \nenterprises). Finally, the subcommittee will establish a one-stop information window to provide \nenterprises with necessary information and guidelines for compliance with all relevant business \nlicenses.  As  both  regulatory  and  operating  licenses  are  largely  decentralized,  a  high  level  of \ninconsistency arises from various authorities. Full information is not provided to SMEs, and thus \na  centralized,  one-stop  information  window  will  facilitate  the  licensing  process  by  providing \nSMEs with both information and guidelines.  \n \n\n3. \n\nEnhance SME Access to Finance \n\n55. \nThe  Program's  components  on  finance  are  closely  linked  with  the  ongoing  FSPL.  The \nFSPL aims to promote the development of a sound, market-based financial system to support \nenhanced resource mobilization and sustainable economic growth by establishing a foundation \nfor  banking,  as  well  as  financial  market  development.  The  challenge  associated  with  SMEs' \naccess to finance cannot be solely resolved by financial sector development, as one of the key \nbarriers relates to developing a viable group of SMEs as potential borrowers. In fact, the recent \nsuccess  of  Acleda  Bank  in  Cambodia  indicates  that  the  financial  sector  can  provide  effective \nmeans of financing to SMEs. Thus, the aim of the Program is to foster SME sector development \nand complement efforts of the FSPL to enhance SME access to finance.   \n \n56. \nAccordingly, the Program emphasizes institutional development of needed infrastructure \nto  reduce  the  risks  and costs  of  lending  to  SMEs,  including  (i)  developing  a  credit  information \nsharing  system  to  help  reduce  the  risks  faced  by  banks  in  lending  to  SMEs;  (ii)  formulating \nsimplified accounting guidelines that are more relevant to the needs of smaller enterprises, but \nmeet  the  requirements  of  potential  lenders  for  information  on  enterprises;  (iii)  formulating \nsimplified  guidelines  and  standard  forms  for  the  tax  filing  system;  and  (iv)  developing  a \nframework  for  leasing  as  a  potential  source  of  longer  term  financing.  The  work  on  leasing  is \nsupported by the FSPL's efforts to establish a secured transactions system.  \n \n\na. \n\nDevelop a Credit Information System \n\nThe main objective is to reduce the risks of commercial banks in their lending activities. \n57. \nA  long-term  goal  associated  with  this  is  to  develop  non-collateral-based  lending.  Cambodia \ndoes  not  have  a  public/private  credit  information  registry,  and  as  a  consequence,  transaction \ncosts for lenders remain high. \n  \n58. \nThe  components  for  this  activity  include  the  following:  First,  NBC,  with  ABC,  is  to \ndevelop  a  credit  information  system  on  a  pilot  basis,  with  the  eventual  goal  of  establishing  a \nprivate  credit  bureau  when  the  market  is  more  developed.  Participation  by  banks  will  be \nvoluntary. A database will be established to receive and provide credit information. Information \nwill  be  collected  from  participating  banks,  and  disclosed  to  the  same  banks,  i.e.,  a  reciprocal \nsystem.  The  system's  database  protects  the  identity  of  existing  lenders  by  not  disclosing  the \nname of the bank providing the information (i.e., name of lender). The database is to be updated \nmonthly  from  information  provided  by  participants.  Participants  have  access  to  the  database. \nSuitable security arrangements must be developed to maintain the integrity of the system and to \nensure that participating banks do not relay incorrect information.  \n\n \n\n\f16\n\n \n\n \n59. \nSecond, to enable the pilot credit information system, a legal framework that protects the \nrights  of  both  participating  banks  and  borrowers  is  needed.  NBC  will  need  to  take  a  proactive \nrole in ensuring that the information system will not be abused (i.e., exchange of inappropriate \ninformation). Accordingly, NBC is to issue the necessary legal and regulatory framework in this \nregard, as well as oversee overall implementation and regulate the system as mandated in the \ncurrent  legal  framework.  Finally,  NBC  and  ABC  are  to  formulate  a  plan  with  the  goal  of \nexpanding  the  pilot  credit  information  system,  given  the  maturity  and  expansion  of  the  market \nfor  credit  information.  One  possibility  is  to  invite  a  foreign  credit  bureau  to  establish  a  joint \nventure with local institutions.  \n \n\nb. \n\nAssist SMEs on the Accounting and Taxation Systems \n\n60. \nThe  main  objective  is  to  help  the  SMEs  effectively  utilize  the  current  accounting \nstandards  of  Cambodia.  First,  a  simplified  financial  reporting  system  will  be  developed.  The \nNational  Accounting  Council  recognizes  the  necessity  for  developing  simplified  financial \nreporting standards or guidelines. The intent is not to develop a separate accounting standard, \nbut to design simplified guidelines based on the relevant current accounting standards so that \nSMEs can improve (i) access to finance, and (ii) financial management of their business.  \n \nTo  develop  SME  guidelines  for  financial  reporting,  based  on  Cambodian  Accounting \n61. \nStandards, MEF will form an SME accounting task force, with National Accounting Council and \nprivate sector representatives, to develop a set of accounting (financial reporting) guidelines for \nSMEs.  To  promote  effective  use  of  the  SME  accounting  guidelines,  MEF  and  National \nAccounting Council will jointly implement training programs with materials for SMEs.  \n \n62. \nComplementing  the  reforms  as  related  to  the  accounting  system,  the  Program  also \nincludes  reform  of  the  current  taxation  system,  based  on  the  recent  efforts  of  the  Technical \nCooperation  and  Assistance  Program  and  ongoing  efforts  of  the  PFM.  MEF  is  to  develop  a \nmore appropriate tax filing system that is not overly complicated for the use of most enterprises. \nMost  enterprises  are  not  aware  of  the  intricacies  of  the  taxation  system;  this  heightens \nuncertainty and thus costs. This problem is also one of the main reasons why a vast majority of \nenterprises are not willing to register, as they will be subject to the formal taxation system. The \noverall  aim  is  to  develop  a  more  transparent  and  fair  tax  filing  system,  thereby  reduce  SME \ncosts and encouraging them to enter the formal regime.25  \n \n\nc. \n\nDevelop a Legal Framework for Leasing \n\n63. \nThe  main  objective  is  to  develop  an  enabling  legal  framework  for  a  leasing  industry  to \nfacilitate  an  inflow  of  bank  and  nonbank  finance  to  SMEs.  The  lack  of  a  legal  framework \ndiscourages financial institutions (mostly commercial banks\u2014both domestic and foreign-owned) \nfrom engaging in leasing.26 The Program identifies the formulation of the legal framework as the \nkey  priority  for  developing  a  leasing  industry  in  Cambodia.  The  framework  must  be \n\n                                                 \n25 The reform of the taxation system complements a more holistic approach currently being undertaken by the PFM, \nwhich  continues  the  recent  assistance  from  the  Technical  Cooperation  and  Assistance  Program  sponsored  by \nADB,  Department  for  International  Development,  International  Monetary  Fund,  and  United  Nations  Development \nProgramme.  Through  the  program,  the  Tax  Department  received  TA  to  develop  tax  policy  and  strengthen  tax \nadministration. Profit taxes in the real regime system are based on self-assessment filings by the taxpayer followed \nby auditing by the Tax Department. \n\n26 This  analysis  is  confirmed  by  another  conducted  by  the  International  Finance  Corporation  in  2002,  which  also \n\nstated that the lack of the legal framework on leasing is considered as the most significant barrier.  \n\n \n\n\f \n\n17 \n\ncomplemented  by  a  supportive  taxation  regime  for  financial  leases.  With  the  recent  efforts  to \ndevelop  the  secured  transactions  system  and  commercial  court  system,  initiation  of  the \ndevelopment of leasing in Cambodia is timely.  \n \nComponents include the following. First, the NBC is to draft an enabling law for finance \n64. \nand  operating  leases  so  that,  over  time,  the  relevant  financial  institutions  can  offer  these  new \nfinancing products to SMEs to provide them with medium- and long-term finance.27 Both banks \nand non-banks will be allowed to engage in leasing. Second, to enable finance leasing, MEF, in \nconsultation with NBC, is to make the necessary changes to the taxation laws and regulations to \nenable  financial  leases  and  to  remove  the  present  discrimination  in  the  tax  law  that  imposes \nwithholding  tax  on  financial  lease  payments,  but  not  on  loan  interest  payments.  The  relevant \nGovernment agencies are to draft implementing guidelines on leasing.  \n \nC. \n\nImportant Features \n\n65. \nIn  an  economy  where  the  business  environment  remains  highly  uncertain,  lacks \ntransparency  and  recourse  for  a  predictable  and  fair  legal  system,  investments  tend  to  be \ndiscouraged.  On  the  other  hand,  an  efficient  market  economy  with  a  highly  transparent  and \npredictable set of market-based rules that are enforceable through an efficient legal system will \nencourage investment and economic transactions to take place. Enterprises will have incentives \nto outsource to SMEs through subcontracting or other arrangements.  \n \n66. \nThe Program will have an impact on SMEs by creating a more predictable and efficient \nbusiness  environment.  This  will  result  from  (i)  coordination  and  a  more  strategic  direction  for \nSME  development,  (ii)  greater  transparency  in  the  reduced  regulatory  requirements,  and  (iii) \nimproved  access  to  finance.  The  establishment  of  the  National  SME  Subcommittee  and  the \nSME development framework should help ensure a coordinated approach to SME development. \nFurthermore,  the  Program  will  reduce  the  cost  of  doing  business  in  time  and  money.  By \nsimplifying  and  computerizing  the  business  registration  process,  it  will  encourage  more \nenterprises  to  enter  the  formal  sector.  The  benefits  include  increased  access  to  government \nservices,  greater  recourse  to  and  protection  under  the  legal  system,  and  enhanced  access  to \nfinance.  The  Program  will  enhance  access  to  finance  through  a  greater  range  of  financial \nproducts such as leasing, and through better information systems such as a credit information-\nsharing  mechanism,  allowing  financial  institutions  to  make  more  informed  decisions.  Better \ninformation systems reduce risks and will reduce the cost of finance.  \n \nIn recognizing the importance of addressing women\u2019s specific needs and constraints in \n67. \nprivate sector development, the Ministry of Women\u2019s Affairs will be included as a member of the \nNational SME Subcommittee. In light of the Government\u2019s commitment to ensure the visibility of \nwomen  entrepreneurs  and  their  contribution  to  the  policy-drafting  and  decision-making \nprocesses, the drafting of the SME development framework will be based on a gender-inclusive \nparticipatory process. This process will imply a systematic consultation with key line ministries \nand private sector representatives, relying upon the Ministry of Women\u2019s Affairs\u2019 outreach and \nnetwork  with  women\u2019s  entrepreneurs  and  business  associations.  In  addition,  to  gather  more \naccurate information on the SME sector and to better reflect women entrepreneurs\u2019 contribution \n\n                                                 \n27 Two types of lease should be distinguished. Financial leasing defined in International Accounting Standard 17 (IAS-\n17) as a transaction where one party, the lessor, owns the asset and leases it to another party; and the lessee, for \na term that in essence covers all or most of the useful life of the asset. IAS-17 considers a finance lease to be a \nfinancial  transaction.  Operating  leasing  is  the  more  generally  understood  form  of  lease  (rental),  where  the  lease \nterm is shorter, does not cover the useful life of the asset, and the asset returns to the lessor at the end of each \nlease.  \n\n \n\n\f18\n\n \n\nto  private  sector  development,  the  National  Institute  of  Statistics,  Ministry  of  Planning,  will \nensure  that  data  collected  on  SMEs  are  also  gender-disaggregated.  The  summary  poverty \nreduction and social strategy is in Appendix 7. \n \nD. \n\nFinancing Plan \n\n68. \nThe  Government  has  requested  a  loan  of  $20  million  equivalent  from  ADB\u2019s  Special \nFunds  resources.  The  loan  will  have  a  24-year  term,  including  a  grace  period  of  8  years,  an \ninterest  charge  at  the  rate  of  1.0%  per  annum  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5%  per  annum \nthereafter,  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  as  are  substantially  in  accordance  with  those \nset forth in the draft Loan Agreement, The Government has provided ADB with (i) the reasons \nfor its decision to borrow from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources on the basis of these terms and \nconditions, and (ii) an undertaking that these choices were its own independent decision and not \nmade in reliance on any communication or advice from ADB. The loan will be released in three \ntranches. \n \nThe  total  loan  amount  for  the  Program  is  determined  on  the  basis  of  the  strategic \n69. \nimportance  of  developing  the  SME  sector  and  the  costs  of  structural  reforms  to  be  supported \nunder  the  Program.  Such  costs  arising  from  reform  measures  to  be  implemented  under  the \nProgram are estimated to be around $25 million to $30 million equivalent during the 36 months \nplanned for program implementation.28 In addition to the Program loan, counterpart funding will \nbe  utilized  for  the  remainder  of  the  costs  associated  with  the  reforms.  Streamlined  tax  filing, \nlicensing, and business registration procedures are expected to reduce fees by $5 million to $8 \nmillion  per  year.  Equipment,  software,  and  hardware  for  establishing  systems  to  support  a \nstreamlined  and  efficient  business  registration  system  will  incur  costs  of  approximately  $4 \nmillion.  Training,  including  local  and  district  training,  is  estimated  to  total  $4  million  per  year. \nHowever,  the  costs  associated  with  the  reforms  are  expected  to  be  compensated  by  an \nincrease  in  Government  revenue  in  the  long  term.  For  example,  as  the  costs  of  registration \ndecreases, more enterprises are expected to register, and thus increase revenue. \n \nE. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n1. \n\nPeriod of Implementation  \n\n70. \nThe  period  for  implementation  of  the  proposed  program  will  be  36  months  from  loan \neffectiveness.  The  first  tranche  will  be  released  upon  loan  effectiveness,29 the  second  tranche \nwill  be  released  approximately  18  months  after  loan  effectiveness,  and  the  third  tranche  is \nexpected  to  be  released  within  36  months  of  loan  effectiveness,  assuming  the  applicable \ntranche release conditions are met. \n \n\n2. \n\nProgram Management \n\n71.  MIME  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  (as  well  as  chair  the  National  SME  Subcommittee \nand provide the subcommittee's secretariat). MIME will be responsible, either as the Executing \nAgency or as the secretariat, for production of required reports; website support and expansion; \nlicensing  reform;  and  development  and  implementation  of  the  SME  development  framework, \none-stop \nthe  recourse  mechanism.  To  coordinate  program \nimplementation  among  Government  ministries  and  agencies  concerned,  a  program  steering \n\ninformation  window,  and \n\n                                                 \n28 Estimates by ADB staff with inputs from the project preparatory TA consultants (footnote 7). \n29  This assumes all 1st tranche conditions have been met by the date of effectiveness.  \n\n \n\n\f \n\n19 \n\ncommittee  (PSC)  will  be  formed.  The  PSC,  chaired  by  the  minister  of  MIME,  will  comprise \nsenior officers from all implementing agencies concerned (MEF, MOC, Ministry of Planning, and \nNBC). The PSC will meet at least twice yearly to review pending issues and propose concrete \nactions for their resolution to ensure timely program implementation. A program implementation \nand coordination unit will be formed within MIME, headed by a senior officer of MIME, to help \nthe  PSC  and  ADB  implement  the  Program.  The  unit  will  be  staffed  by  MIME  officials  with \nsufficient knowledge and capacity to assist the PSC and ADB. The unit will be responsible for \nday-to-day implementation of the Program.  \n \n\n3. \n\nProcurement and Disbursement \n\n72. \nFor  the  ADB  loan,  in  accordance  with  the  simplified  disbursement  procedures  and \nrelated requirements for program loans, all procurement of goods and services produced in and \noriginating  from  ADB  member  countries  will  be  made  with  due  consideration  to  economy  and \nefficiency,  in  accordance  with  standard  public  procedures  in  Cambodia  and  normal  private \nsector  commercial  practices  acceptable  to  ADB.  Goods  commonly  traded  on  the  international \ncommodity markets will be procured in accordance with procedures appropriate to the trade and \nacceptable to ADB. \n \n73. \nThe loan proceeds will be disbursed for a broad range of imports, subject to a negative \nlist  of  ineligible  items  (Appendix  8).  The  Government  will  certify  that  the  value  of  total  imports \nminus (i) imports from nonmember countries, (ii) ineligible imports, and (iii) disbursements made \nunder  other  official  development  assistance,  is  greater  than  the  amount  expected  to  be \ndisbursed during the year. ADB will have the right to audit the use of the loan proceeds and to \nverify the accuracy of the Government's certification. \n \n\n4. \n\nCounterpart Funds \n\nThe Government has provided assurances that sufficient funds will be made available to \n74. \nmeet the costs associated with the reform program supported under the Program, including, (i) \nallocations to cover expenses relating to dissemination of regulatory information through print or \nother mass media or the Internet; (ii) institutional capacity building to plan, design, and enforce \nSME development; and (iii) support for specific program measures.  \n \n\n5. \n\nMonitoring and Tranching \n\na. \n\nMonitoring \n\n75. \nThe  Government  and  ADB  will  continue  to  engage  in  active  policy  dialogue  on  sector \nissues,  policy  reforms,  and  other  measures  during  program  implementation  and  on  additional \nreforms that may be considered necessary or desirable. \n \n76. \nThe Government will provide ADB with semiannual reports on program implementation, \nand  on  the  accomplishment  of  the  Program's  objectives.  The  consolidated  reports  will  be \nsubmitted in such form as ADB may reasonably request, and will include (i) progress made and \nspecific problems encountered during the 6 months under review, (ii) steps taken or proposed to \nbe taken to resolve the problems, and (iii) proposed program activities and expected progress \nduring the following 6 months. ADB will send regular review missions to confirm compliance with \nconditions for the second and third tranche releases, and advise on actions to maintain program \nimplementation on course. The Government will prepare and provide ADB with a consolidated \n\n \n\n\f20\n\n \n\nprogram  completion  report  on  the  overall  impact  of  the  policy  reforms  implemented  within  3 \nmonths from completion of the proposed program.  \n \n\nb. \n\nTranching \n\n77. \nThe  loan  will  be  released  in  three  tranches  subject  to  the  Government  meeting  the \napplicable tranche release conditions. The first tranche of $7 million equivalent is expected to be \nreleased upon loan effectiveness, the second tranche of $8 million equivalent approximately 18 \nmonths after loan effectiveness, and the third tranche of $5 million equivalent is expected within \n36 months of loan effectiveness.  \n \n\nV. \n\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n\nfor  consensus  building  and \n\n78. \nThe  TA  aims  to  support  the  implementation  of  various  policy  and  institutional  reform \nmeasures to support SME development\u2014as specified in the Program\u2014as well as provide key \ninstitutional  capacity-building  support  to  the  implementing  agencies.  The  main  activities  of  the \nTA will include (i) technical support to the Government in its efforts to undertake the reforms; (ii) \ncapacity  building  support  to  the  Government  through  workshops,  roundtable  discussions,  and \nformal/informal  discussions;  and  (iii)  support \ninformation \ndissemination through a series of workshops and other related events. \n \n79. \nThe  TA  will  be  cofinanced  by  ADB  and  the  Government  of  Denmark.  ADB  will  provide \n$500,000  on  a  grant  basis  from  ADB\u2019s  TA  funding  program;  the  Government  of  Denmark  will \nprovide  $350,000  on  a  grant  basis.  The  Government  of  Cambodia  will  finance  the  remaining \n$150,000  equivalent  of  the  local  currency  costs,  including  provision  of  counterpart  staff,  office \nspace,  administrative  services,  and  physical  facilities.  The  ADB  grant  will  cover  the  entire \nforeign exchange costs and part of the local currency cost. Inception of the TA is scheduled for \n2005,  with  implementation  over  8  months.  A  total  of  26  person-months  of  international \nconsulting  services  and  32  person-months  of  domestic  consulting  services  will  be  required. \nConsultants  will  be  recruited  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants \nand other arrangements satisfactory to ADB. Procurement under the TA will be in accordance \nwith  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines \nimplementation \narrangements, including the budget of the TA, are in Appendix 9. \n \n80. \nGiven  the  extensive  need  for  TA  for  implementing  the  Program,  provision  of  additional \nassistance  to  the  implementing  agencies  will  be  considered,  pending  availability  of  TA  funds, \nboth  within  ADB  and  from  other  development  agencies.  Priority  will  be  given  to:  (i)  capacity \nbuilding  activities  of  the  implementing  agencies,  assessed  as  not  being  sufficiently  covered \nunder the attached TA, and (ii) technical support to achieve compliance with policy actions for \nrelease of the third tranche of the loan. A succeeding TA is currently in the pipeline for $500,000 \nin 2006. Confirmation of the TA will take place during the country-programming mission in 2005.   \n \n\nfor  Procurement.  The  objectives,  scope,  and \n\nVI. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n\nA. \n\nBenefits and Impacts \n\n81. \nThe Program\u2019s impact on SMEs will be the creation of a more predictable and efficient \nbusiness environment. This will occur through (i) coordination and a more strategic direction in \ngovernment  SME  development;  (ii)  reduction  of  and  greater  transparency  in,  regulatory \nrequirements; and (iii) improved access to finance.  \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n21 \n\nGreater coordination and strategic direction in SME policy is expected to result in better \n82. \ncoordination between ministries and a more consistent market friendly approach in dealing with \nSMEs.  It  will  also  result  in  government  programs  taking  onboard  the  lessons  learned  in  SME \ndevelopment, and applying best practice to programs and government interventions in the SME \nsector.  The  Program  will  also  reduce  the  cost  of  doing  business  in  time  and  money.  By \nsimplifying  and  computerizing  the  business  registration  process,  it  will  encourage  more \nenterprises to enter the formal sector. Benefits to entering the formal sector include access to \ngovernment services; recourse to, and protection under the legal system; and enhanced access \nto  finance.  Finally,  the  Program  will  enhance  access  to  finance,  by  increasing  the  range  of \nfinancial  products  such  as  leasing,  and  improving  information  systems  such  as  a  credit \ninformation  sharing  mechanism.  Financial  institutions  will  be  able  to  make  more  informed \ndecisions; thus leading to reduced cost of financing.  \n \n83. \nthe \nenvironment  for  doing  business,  leading  to  greater  economic  activity  and  more  employment, \nwhich will have a catalytic impact on the development of the private sector.  \n \nB. \n\nRisks and Safeguards \n\nimplementation  of \n\nthe  Program  will \n\nThe  successful \n\nincrementally \n\nimprove \n\n84. \nSuccessful implementation of the Program entails three risks. The first relates to a low \nlevel of capacity within the Government to implement some of the complex reforms. In previous \nprograms, delays were caused predominantly by lack of technical expertise. To address this risk, \nTA  is  being  provided  to  support  Program  implementation,  and  provide  capacity-building \nactivities (in coordination with other development agencies).  \n \n85. \nA second risk relates to lack of coordination among various Government agencies. The \nProgram  requires  close  coordination  among  the  relevant  authorities\u2014both  horizontally  among \ndifferent  ministries  and  agencies  concerned,  and  vertically  with  the  provincial  and  district \nauthorities. Consultation and coordination will be required with other stakeholders active in SME \ndevelopment.  The  Program  design  has  taken  this  risk  into  consideration  and  emphasizes \ninteragency  coordination  mechanisms,  particularly  by  establishing  an \ninter-ministerial \ncoordination body (National SME Subcommittee) with private sector participation. \n \n86. \nA third risk relates to good governance of the central and local government authorities. \nLocal governance is particularly important, as the Program's most direct impact on SMEs will be \nat  the  local  level.  These  risks,  common  to  several  programs,  are  being  addressed  by  the \nGovernment's PFM, supported by a number of development agencies, including ADB.  \n \n87. \nOverall,  the  environmental  implications  of  the  Program  loan  were  reviewed  and  no \nsignificant  adverse  impact  was  identified.  The  loan  is  classified  as  category  C  under  ADB's \nenvironmental classification system. A review of license issuance and inspection procedures of \nthe  Ministry  of  Environment  and  other  major  ministries  will  be  supported  under  the  loan. \nInstituting  streamlined  and  coherent  rules  and  procedures  among  regulatory  agencies  is \nexpected  to  contribute  to  promoting  transparency,  accountability,  and  effectiveness  among \nregulatory agencies, as well as stricter compliance to environmental standards among SMEs. \n \n\n \n\n\f22\n\n \n\nA. \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\nVII. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  and  MIME  have  given  the \n\n88. \nfollowing assurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents:  \n\n(i)  \n\n(ii)  \n\nThe policies adopted and actions taken before the date of the Loan Agreement \nas described in the development policy letter will continue to be in effect for the \nduration of the Program period and subsequently.  \n\nThe  Government  will  promptly  adopt  such  policies  and  take  other  actions \nincluded  in  the  Program  and  specified  in  the  development  policy  letter,  and  will \nensure that such policies and actions continue to be in effect for the duration of \nthe Program and subsequently. \n\nB. \n\nConditions for Loan Effectiveness \n\nThe conditions for loan effectiveness are the following:  \n\n89. \n \n\n(i) \n\nthe  Government  will  form  a  PSC,  chaired  by  the  minister  of  MIME,  and \ncomprising senior officers from MEF, MOC, Ministry of Planning, and NBC; and  \n\n \n(ii)   MIME will establish a program implementation and coordination unit, responsible \nfor day-to-day program implementation, headed by a senior officer of MIME and \nstaffed  with  MIME  officials  (subject  to  acceptability  by  ADB)  with  sufficient \nknowledge and capacity to assist the PSC and meet the requirements of ADB. \n\n \nConditions for Disbursement \n\nC. \n\nThe disbursement of the three tranches is subject to fulfillment of specified first, second, \n\n90. \nand third tranche release conditions as set out in the policy matrix. \n \n\nVIII.  RECOMMENDATION \n\n91. \nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  loan  would  comply  with  the  Articles  of  Agreement  of \nADB  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to \nSpecial  Drawing  Rights  13,344,000  to  the  Kingdom  of  Cambodia  for  the  Small  and  Medium \nEnterprise Development Program, from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources, with an interest charge \nat the rate of 1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter; a term of \n24  years,  including  a  grace  period  of  8  years;  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  as  are \nsubstantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  draft  Loan  Agreement  presented  to  the \nBoard. \n \n \n18 November 2004  \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nTadao Chino \nPresident \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n23 \n\nPROGRAM FRAMEWORK \n\n \n\nDesign Summary \n\nGoal \n \nEconomic growth \nbased on private \nsector development \n\nPurpose \n \nImprove business \nenvironment, which \nwill be important \nparticularly in \nimproving \nopportunities for the \ndevelopment of \nsmall and medium \nenterprises (SMEs).  \n\nPerformance Indicators/ \nTargets \n\n \nIncreased gross domestic \nproduct (GDP) \n \nIncreased trades \nIncreased number of private \nenterprises \n \nReduced unemployment  \n \nReduced incidence of poverty \n \nIncreased share of SMEs\u2019 GDP  \n \nIncreased number of established \nSMEs  \n \nIncreased contribution of \nemployment from SMEs to total \nemployment in the country \n\nMonitoring \nMechanisms \n\n \nEconomic reports and \nofficial statistics of the \nGovernment, and private \nsector organizations, and \ninternational development \nagencies \n \nAsian Development Bank \n(ADB) staff assessments \n\n \nEconomic reports and \nofficial statistics of the \nGovernment, private \nsector organizations, and \ninternational development \nagencies \n \nOfficial, legal documents \nissued by the Government \n \nADB review missions \n \n \n\nOutputs \n1.

In  the  agriculture  sector,  most  small  enterprises  operate  on  an  informal  basis \nwithout any  form of registration or taxation. The formal agriculture subsector includes only the \nenterprises holding Government concessions. The nonfarm subsector operates both informally \nand formally. Microenterprises operate largely informally without permits or licenses and do not \npay  profit  tax.  Small  enterprises,  while  often  licensed  to  operate  by  the  Ministry  of  Commerce \n(MOC) and other relevant ministries at the provincial-municipal level, normally do not pay profit \ntaxes  and  are  regulated  informally  by  local  authorities.  Nonlicensed  enterprises  are  often \nsubject to paying small-scale unofficial fees to local authorities.  \n \n\n Table A2.1: Classification of Labor Force and Gross Domestic Product \n by Formal/Informal Sector \n \n\n \nSector \n \nTotal \nFormal a \n\nGarment \nTourism \n\nInformal \n\nAgriculture \nIndustry b \nServices c \n\nLabor Force  \n(000's) \n\nGDP  \n($ million) \n\n2000 \n5,430 \n260 \n200 \n60 \n5,170 \n4,196 \n217 \n757 \n\n2001 \n5,630 \n275 \n210 \n65 \n5,355 \n4,352 \n224 \n779 \n\n2000 \n3,149 \n596 \n363 \n233 \n2,552 \n928 \n426 \n1,198 \n\n2001 \n3,234 \n660 \n407 \n253 \n2,573 \n919 \n421 \n1,233 \n\nGDP = gross domestic product \na  Because  of  lack  of  information,  the  data  does  not  include  companies  in  the  food  and  tobacco \nindustry, communications, wholesale, and finance that provide formal jobs.  \nb Mostly includes handicraft and small factories.  \nc Mostly includes trade, transportation, and other informal services. \nSource: Cambodian Development Resource Institute, compiled from government primary data and \ninstitute surveys. \n\n \n2. \nTable A2.1 provides an estimate of the contribution of the formal and informal sectors in \nthe  economy.  According  to  Cambodian  Development  Resource  Institute  estimates,  95%  of  all \nemployment  is  provided  by  the  informal  sector,  while  80%  of  the  gross  domestic  product  is \ninformal.  The  foreign  sector  plays  a  large  role  in  the  formal  sector.  Approximately  90%  of  the \nemployees of the garment sector are working in foreign-owned companies. The tourism sector \nis  also  heavily  foreign  owned  with  approximately  two  thirds  of  all  approved  capital  investment \ncoming from abroad.  \n \nB. \n\nSubsector Profiles \n\nAgriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries. According to Cambodian Development Resource \n3. \nInstitute  estimates  that  by  far  the  largest  share  of  domestic  private  employment  (77%  of  the \nlabor  force)  is  employed  in  informal  agriculture  (Table  A2.2).  Most  rural  households  are \nengaged in some form of agriculture, especially rice paddy production, mainly for home use and \ntrade.  Rice  production  has  grown  at  an  average  annual  rate  of  2.8%  from  1995  to  2001. 1 \n\n                                                 \n1  The Royal Government of Cambodia. 2001.

Phnom Penh. \n\n\f \n\n  Appendix 2          31 \n\nAccording to various estimates, between 4 million and 4.4 million people derive the majority of \ntheir income from agriculture;2 the majority are smallholders. Poverty levels in this area are high. \nApproximately 75% of the poor live in households headed by farmers. Productivity of agriculture \nis low in terms of labor (about $166/worker) and in terms of land ($480/ha).3 While total output \nhas  been  increasing,  the  per  capita  area  of  cultivation  has  decreased  significantly  since  1995 \nfrom 0.82 hectares per worker to 0.77 hectares (2001).4 As the population grows, the demand \nfor land increases, resulting in reduced farm size, migration from rural to urban areas, and an \nincrease in landless people.  \n \n\nTable A2.2: Rice Production, Cultivation, and Employment Trends \n \n1997 \n\n1999 \n\n1995 \n\n1998 \n\n2000 \n\n1996 \n\n2001 \n\nItem \n\nOutput ('000 tons) \nArea Cultivated  \n('000 ha) \nEmployment ('000) \n\nOutput/Employment \n\n(tons) \n\nArea Cultivated/ \n\nEmployment (ha) \n\n3,447.8 \n\n3,404.0\n\n3,414.9\n\n3,509.9\n\n4,029.6 \n\n4,049.9 \n\n4,026.1\n\n2,086.0 \n\n2,153.0\n\n2,076.0\n\n2,094.7\n\n2,157.6 \n\n2,318.5 \n\n2,240.9\n\n2,533.0 \n\n2,620.0\n\n2,691.0\n\n2,754.0\n\n2,813.0 \n\n2,850.0 \n\n2,901.0\n\n1.361 \n\n1.299\n\n1.269\n\n1.274\n\n1.432 \n\n1.421 \n\n1.388\n\n0.824 \n\n0.822\n\n0.771\n\n0.761\n\n0.767 \n\n0.814 \n\n0.772\n\nha =  hectares. \nSource:  The  Royal  Government  of  Cambodia.  2002.

According to the Ministry of \nAgriculture,  Forestry,  and  Fisheries,  approximately  465,000  people  are  employed,  deriving \nseasonal incomes or subsisting on the fishery and other aquatic resources.5 Most fishery activity \nis in the informal sector. The ministry estimates that 84% of all labor in the fishery subsector is \ninvolved  in  family  fishing.  Family  fishers  are  small  scale  (1\u20133  persons),  who  fish  primarily  for \nfamily subsistence. They pay no fees to the Department of Fisheries and are permitted to catch \nfish  throughout  the  year  in  areas  outside  fishing  reserves  and  fishing  lots,  which  currently \naccount for approximately 56% of all fisheries in the country.  \n \nThe  formal  agriculture  subsector  covers  enterprises  with  land  concessions.  Agriculture \n5. \nconcessions have been awarded to 25 companies with total land area of 723,000 hectares, of \nwhich only 82,000 hectares (11.3%) have been cultivated. Agriculture concessions account for \nonly 3.6% of all cultivated land area in Cambodia. \n \n6. \nEnterprises  with  forest  concessions  make  up  the  formal  forestry  subsector.  Currently, \n3.9  million  hectares,  or  about  37%  of  forested  land,  have  been  given  as  concessions  to  14 \nlogging companies. The Government has revoked the licenses of 15 companies operating on 22 \nforest sites covering a total area of slightly more than 3 million hectares as part of its policy to \n                                                 \n2  The Labor Force Survey of Cambodia, 2001, estimates that 4.07 million people work in the agriculture sector while \n\nthe Cambodian Development Resource Institute figure is 4.35 million.  \n\n3  ADB.  2002.

Activity  in  the  forestry  sector  has  come  to  a \nhalt with the banning of exports of logs in 2000 and the cutting of trees on concession land in \n2001.  Logging  operations  on  forest  concession  land  are  suspended  until  concession  holders \nsubmit forest management plans that are approved by the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and \nFisheries.  \n \n7. \nThe  informal  forestry  subsector  is  mainly  community  forestry,  which  currently  covers \n71,724  hectares,  less  than  0.7%  of  total  forest  area  (footnote  3).  Although  this  management \nmodel  may  expand  in  the  future,  several  constraints  to  its  development  are  related  to  the \nclarification of property rights in forest areas, the demarcation between different types of forest \nand  agricultural  land,  and  the  social  cohesion  of  communities.  The  isolation  of  the  forest \ncommunities  makes  monitoring  difficult,  and  the  lack  of  adequate  institutional  capacity  to \nsupport the communities with training and resources for reforestation and maintenance of forest \nresources is a major constraint. \n \n8. \nTrade  and  Services.  In  2002,  MOC  issued  a  prakas  (No.  078  MOC/M2002)  on \nprocedures  for  monitoring  activities  related  to  trade  services  and  commerce  requiring  small \nenterprises  not  registered  under  the  Law  on  Commercial  Rules  and  Registration  to  obtain  a \nlicense  to  operate  commercial  activities  and  services  through  MOC\u2019s  provincial-municipal \ndepartments.  Through  this  process,  MOC  licensed  30,752  enterprises.  However,  many \nenterprises  remain  unlicensed  by  MOC,  obtaining  operating  permits  from  other  relevant \nministries instead. MOC estimates that 21,268 of these enterprises are food processors, while \n5,634  are  manufacturers,  4,811  are  service  providers,  and  729  are  in  forestry  and  fisheries. \nMOC  is  unable  to  provide  a  detailed  breakdown  by  industry  or  comprehensive  data  on \nemployment  and  output  of  these  locally  licensed  enterprises.  Such  information  would  be  very \nuseful to policymakers to better understand the informal sector, which comprises such a large \nportion of Cambodia\u2019s economic activity and employment.   \n \nManufacturing.

Registered  private  enterprises  constitute  what  is  referred  to  as  the  formal \nprivate  sector.  As  of  the  end  of  2002,  9,265  enterprises  were  registered  with  MOC.  These \nenterprises  comprise  7,586  limited  companies,  1,513  sole  proprietors,  197  representative \noffices,  69  branch  offices,  and  677  dissolved  enterprises.6 MOC  does  not  sort  this  data  by \nsector or industry so obtaining an accurate picture of the makeup of the establishments is not \npossible.  The  commercial  registration  is  required  only  for  enterprises  meeting  the  Tax \nDepartment\u2019s  annual  turnover  threshold  for  entering  the  real  regime.  Although  it  is  not \nmentioned  in  the  Law  on  Commercial  Rules  and  Registration,  registered  enterprises  are \nrequired  to pay  profit  tax  according  to  the  real regime  method,  meaning  they  must  file  regular \nincome statements and pay the 1% advanced profit tax every month. These enterprises are also \nsubject to value-added tax. Only about 2,000 companies are estimated to have tax codes.  \n \n11.   Geographic  Distribution  of  SMEs.  No  national  data  are  available  on  the  geographic \ndistribution  of  SMEs.  In  2001,  MIME  conducted  a  survey  of  small  enterprises  operating  in  the \nmanufacturing  sector.

Women\u2019s  Role  in  SME  Development.  Small  and  microenterprises  are  an  important \nsource of employment for women. Based on the survey of over 25,000 firms, about one third of \nemployees are women\u2014further indicating the importance of women workers in Cambodia.  The \nbreakdowns of male and female workers by industry groups show that a majority of the women \nare engaged in the informal sector. In addition to agriculture and fisheries, women are engaged \nin  unskilled  and  semiskilled,  low-paid  economic  activities  such  as  craft  and  related  trade/retail \noccupations.  \n \n\n\f

In Cambodia, SMEs dominate the economy \nand  are  a  major  source  of  employment  for  the  poor.  The  Program  is  expected  to  increase  SMEs\u2019  contribution  to \neconomic  growth,  employment  generation,  and  poverty  reduction.  Through  creating  a  more  conducive  business \nenvironment  by  coordinating  the  Government\u2019s  SME  strategies,  minimizing  regulatory  requirements,  and  enhancing \naccess to finance, Program in the medium- to long-term will have significant impact on SMEs, increase opportunities \nfor employment, and reduce the incidence of poverty in urban areas. To the extent possible, the Program will ensure \nthat the process of SME policy drafting, validation, and implementation follow the Government\u2019s stated goal to foster \nparticipation,  and  promote  social  inclusion  and  gender-responsiveness  in  pursuing  its  poverty  reduction  efforts.  A \nsignificant  proportion  of  SMEs  are  found  in  the  rural  area.  Extending  the  outreach  and  impact  of  the  proposed \ninterventions  beyond  the  densely  populated  cities  of  Phnom  Penh,  Sianoukville,  Siem  Reap,  and  Battambang  is  a \ncritical risk. \n \n \nB. \n \nIn  the  National  Poverty  Reduction  Strategy  (2003\u20132005),  a  number  of  investment  studies  identified  the  following \nissues as barriers to private sector development and micro- and SME development: poor physical infrastructure, high \ncosts  of  transportation,  electricity  and  telecommunications,  safety  and  respect  of  signed  contracts,  limited  human \nresources,  increasing  labor  costs,  high  transactions  costs,  and  the  lack  of  proper  legal  and  judicial  systems. \nCambodia\u2019s Poverty Partnership Agreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) further reiterates the critical areas \nof ADB support, which include developing the financial sector, following the Financial Sector Blueprint, and supporting \nreforms  of  the  legal  infrastructure  for  business.  In  line  with  the  priorities  set  forth  in  the  National  Poverty  Reduction \nStrategy  and  Poverty  Partnership  Agreement,  the  Program  aims  to  address  some  of  the  structural  policy  and \nlegal/regulatory impediments to PSD and micro- and SME development. Identified priorities include the following: \n \n\nPoverty Analysis \n\n\u2022  Coordination and a more strategic direction in SME development. Greater coordination and strategic direction in \nSME policy is expected to result in better coordination between ministries and a more consistent market-friendly \napproach in dealing with SMEs. It will also result in Government programs taking on board the lessons learned \nin SME development and applying best practice to program and Government interventions in the SME sector. \n\n \n\u2022  Reduction and greater transparency in the regulatory requirements. The Program will reduce the costs of doing \nbusiness. By simplifying and computerizing the business registration process, it will encourage more enterprises \nto  enter  the  formal  sector,  thus  benefiting  from  access  to  Government  services,  recourse  to  and  protection \nunder the legal system, and enhanced access to finance. In the agro-industry sector, where informality and poor \ninfrastructures  are  critical,  the  Program  is  expected  to  have  significant  benefits,  by  improving  entry  into  the \nformal  sector  through  registration  reform,  licensing  review  process,  and  improved  inspections  system.  The \nportal  site  will  assist  in  availability  of  information  and  improve  value  chains,  an  essential  component  for  a \ncompetitive market. \n\nImproved  access  to  finance.  Finally,  the  Program  will  enhance  access  to  finance,  through  a  greater  range  of \nfinancial products such as leasing, and through better information systems such as a credit information sharing \nmechanisms allowing financial institutions to make more informed decisions. Better information systems reduce \nrisks  and  assuming  all  else  is  equal,  will  reduce  the  cost  of  finance.  The  successful  implementation  of  the \nProgram will incrementally improve the environment for doing business, leading to greater economic activity and \nmore employment, which will have a catalytic impact of PSD in Cambodia. \n\n\u2022 \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n  Appendix 7 \n\n59 \n\n \n\n \n\n \nReforming the licensing, registration, accounting, and inspection processes for micro- and SMEs is likely to erode the \nvested interests of those perpetuating illegal and corruptive business practices. The establishment of transparent, \nmarket-friendly, socially inclusive and\u2014to the extent possible\u2014gender-responsive business practices is also likely to \npromote private sector confidence and contribute to the establishment of pro-poor governance structures. \n\nParticipation Process \n\n \nC. \n \nStakeholder Analysis                                                               No \n \nDuring  project  design,  no  formal  stakeholder  analysis  was  conducted.  However,  the  formulation  of  the  Program  is \nbased  on  extensive  formal  and  informal  stakeholder  consultations.  Agreement  on  the  Program  components  comes \nfrom in-depth analysis and extensive discussions. These discussions started with ADB\u2019s Private Sector Assessment in \n2003  in  collaboration  with  a  broad  range  of  stakeholders,  which  were  part  of  the  consultative  group  for  the  Private \nSector Assessment, and included: Ministry of Industry, Mines, and Energy; Ministry of Economy and Finance, Ministry \nof Commerce, Council for the Development of Cambodia, National Bank of Cambodia, Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry \nand  Fishery,  Ministry  of  Tourism,  Ministry  of  Women\u2019s  Affairs,  the  Chamber  of  Commerce  of  Cambodia,  the  World \nBank, the International Finance Corporation, the Mekong Project Development Facility, several bilateral development \nagencies,  25  enterprises,  major  nongovernment  organizations,  business  associations,  legal  professionals,  and \nconsultants. This support continued under the project preparatory technical assistance from February to August 2004. \nIn  particular,  policy  measures  proposed  under  the  Program  have  been  discussed  extensively  with  Government \ndepartments and officials directly concerned with each issue in terms of policy development and at the technical and \ndecision-making levels. To assist with implementation, technical inputs have been provided from experts in the fields \nof SME policy, registration systems, licensing review process, simplified accounting standards, and credit information \nsystems.  The  discussions  resulted  in  agreement  with  the  Government  on  the  objective  and  scope  of  the  Program. \nFinal  technical  discussions  with  a  broad  range  of  Government  and  PSD  stakeholders  (including  women \nentrepreneurs) were held during the consultation workshop for the Program on 29 July 2004. \n \nParticipation strategy                                                               No \n \nD.      Gender Development \n \nStrategy to Maximize impacts on Women \n \nIn  light  of  the  critical  importance  to  voice  women\u2019s  specific  needs  and  constraints  in  PSD  and  SME  enterprise \ndevelopment, the Ministry of Women\u2019s Affairs will be integrated as a full member of the national SME subcommittee, \nwhich will be established to design the SME development framework. This may be done prior to the release of the 1st \ntranche, if a revision of the draft subdecree currently submitted for approval to the Prime Minister is feasible, or, in any \nevent,  prior  to  the  release  of  the  2nd  tranche.  In  light  of  the  Government\u2019s  commitment  to  ensure  the  visibility  of \nwomen  entrepreneurs  and  their  contribution  to  the  policy-drafting  and  decision-making  processes,  the  SME \ndevelopment framework will be drafted based on an iterative and gender-inclusive consultative process. This process \nwill imply a systematic consultation with key line ministries, private sector representatives, relying upon the Ministry of \nWomen\u2019s Affairs\u2019 extensive outreach and network with business associations and women\u2019s entrepreneurs. \n \nData  and  information  on  SMEs  are  scarce  and  unreliable  in  Cambodia,  and  present  formidable  challenges  in \nbenchmarking  the  social  impact  of  the  proposed  interventions.  To  gather  more  accurate  information  on  the  SME \nsector and to better reflect women\u2019s and women\u2019s entrepreneurs\u2019 contribution to private sector and SME development, \nthe  National  Institute  of  Statistics,  Ministry  of  Planning,  will  ensure  that  data  collected  on  SME  are  gender-\ndisaggregated.  This  will  provide  the  Government  with  a  better  basis  to  formulate  gender-responsive  policy  and \ninterventions. In this respect, the finalization of ADB-funded micro- and small-enterprises development framework for \nthe  Ministry  of  Women\u2019s  Affairs\u2019  Strategic  Plan  [TA-3947-CAM]  will  contribute  to  defining  specific  needs  and \nconstraints  faced  by  women\u2019s  entrepreneurs  and  women-run  businesses,  and  define  a  strategy  for  more  concerted \nand targeted Government and development agency interventions. \n \nOutput Prepared                                                                   No \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\f60 \n\nAppendix 7 \n\n \n\nSocial Safeguards and other Social Risks \n\n \nE. \n \n \n  \n\n \n\nSignificant/ \nNot Significant/ \nNone \n\n \n\n \n \nStrategy to Address Issues \n\nResettlement  \n\nNone \n\nNo involuntary resettlement impacts are anticipated.  \n\nAffordability \n\nNone \n\nThe  Program  will  contribute  to  reducing  the  costs  of  doing \nbusiness  in  money  and  time,  and  provide  direct  and  stronger \nincentives  for  micro  and  small  entrepreneurs  interested  in \njoining  the  formal  sector.  Business  services  made  available \nunder  the  Program  are  expected  to  be  affordable  for  all \nentrepreneurs.
