Armenia has a relatively small population (3.24 million), but is the most urbanized country \nin  the  Caucasus.  Urban  areas,  with  2.1  million  people  or  64%  of  the  total  population,  already \naccount for most of the country\u2019s economic activity and employment. Armenian urban areas fall \ninto  four  categories 3  (i)  Yerevan,  the  capital  city  with  1.12  million  people;  (ii)  mid-sized \nsecondary cities such as Gyumri, Kapan, and Vanadzor; (iii) small and medium size cities with \nimportant  industrial  and  agro-processing  complexes  such  as  Armavir,  Artashat,  Ashtarak  and \nArarat;  and  (iv)  cities  with  high  tourism  potential  such  as  Dilijan,  Jermuk,  Sevan,  and \nTsakhkadzor.  These  12  cities  account  for  almost  90%  of  the  nation's  gross  domestic  product, \nwith Yerevan alone accounting for 60%.  \n \n3.    Shifting urban landscape. Unbalanced economic growth among regions, posing serious \ndevelopment challenges to planners and policy makers. Some cities are growing fast, others are \nnot.  Some  house  only  one  industry  at  best;  others  struggle  to  attract  one.  Even  Yerevan  has \nseen  change.  A  gradual  collapse  of  its  heavy  industry,  in  the  early  1990s,  then  located  in  its \nsouthern  ring,  created  a  rapid  shift  in  the  location  of  commercial  and  residential  centers,  and \ncorresponding changes in the demand for metro, tramway, trolleybus and bus network services. \nThese  changes  have  increased  motorization,  but  also  led  to  poor  air  quality,  noise,  traffic \ncongestion, loss of green areas, and degraded historical buildings. Many secondary cities have \nalso grown since the 1990s and now share most of Yerevan\u2019s problems.4  \n \n4.    Traffic  and  road  safety  concerns.  Growth  has  brought  widespread  vehicle  ownership, \nwhich has grown by 40% since 2004.5 The number of accidents in Yerevan has risen in parallel, \nfrom  260  fatalities  in  2004  to  more  than  400  in  2008,  with  the  number  of  injured  more  than \ndoubling from 1,500 in 2004 to 3,125 in 2008. This has put road safety on the agenda. Despite \nimprovements  in  major  arteries  in  the  capital,  the  traffic  signal  system  is  outdated  and \ninadequate. Environmental protection is now another priority. Located in Ararat Valley, Yerevan \nhas  little  natural  ventilation,  and  congestion  results  in  concentration  of  hazardous  substances. \nUrban transport generated 90% of air pollution in 2009, with carbon dioxide emissions expected \nto increase by 160% by 2020. The limited number of bridges in Yerevan over the Hrazdan River \ncreates  bottlenecks  and  massive  congestion  during  peak  hours.  In  addition,  a  city  bypass \nremains  uncompleted,  disallowing  any  diversion  of  passing  traffic.  Illegal  and  double  parking \nand  poorly  enforced  traffic  laws  further  constrain  mobility.  In  2009,  traffic  exceeded  design \n\n                                                 \n1   See the design and monitoring framework in Appendix 1. \n2   The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  provided  project  preparatory  technical  assistance.  ADB.  2009.  Technical \nAssistance to Armenia for Preparing the Yerevan Sustainable Urban Transport Project. Manila (TA 7340-ARM). \n\n3   ADB. Armenia: Strategic Urban Assessment. Manila. (TA 6423-REG). \n4   See Sector Assessment and Roadmap Summary: Urban Transport (accessible from the list of linked documents in \n\nAppendix 2). \n\n5   With 130,000 vehicles registered in 2009, Yerevan accounts for 40% of vehicles nationally. \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\ncapacity on more than 20% of the road network, and a further 35% was about to reach its limit. \nMost of these problems are replicated in other cities.  \n \n5.   \nInadequate  public  transport  services. The Yerevan public transport system comprises \nmicrobuses,  buses,  trolleybuses,  and  metro  routes.6 Its  public  transport  infrastructure  is  aged, \nand  vehicle  fleet  old  and  poorly  maintained,  travelling  an  average  speed  of  16  kilometers  per \nhour.  The  metro  network  has  a  single  12.1  km  line  with  10  stations  and  a  fleet  of  70  old \ncarriages. Metro ridership accounts for only 8.2% of total public transport ridership, which stood \nat  207  million  passenger  trips  in  2009.  Today,  85%  of  the  passengers  are  carried  by \nunsubsidized  private  microbuses,  despite  their  expensive  fares. 7  While  minibuses  spared \nYerevan  a  severe  transport  crisis  in  the  1990s,  they  now  contribute  to  a  chaotic  situation  that \nhas seen big and medium-sized buses pushed out. Service quality is poor due to overloading \nand congestion. This shift has severely compromised the financial sustainability of other public \ntransport  services  and  caused  investment  backlogs  for  trolleybus  and  metro,  as  fares  are  too \nlow to cover operating and renewal costs. In other Armenian cities, the urban transport issues \nare  similar  albeit  less  dire.  They  have  deteriorating  urban  road  networks  with  inefficient  or \nnonexistent systems of traffic management and poor public transport that relies far too heavily \non  microbuses.  The  transport  network  needs  restructuring,  as  routes  often  duplicate  others. \nService  quality  is  poor  and  the  level  of  comfort  minimal.  In  tourist  centers,  urban  transport \ninfrastructure  is  unable  to  cope  with  the  inflows  at  peak  periods.  These  limitations  are \naccompanied by rising gaps in the quality of municipal planning, finance and monitoring.  \n \n6.    Sector  strategy,  roadmap,  and  institutional  reform.  The  national  government  and \nYerevan  municipality  have  invested  more  than  $185  million  during  2005-2010  in  upgrading \nurban  infrastructure.  But  these  investments  are  only  patching  up  immediate  problems.  More \ninvestments are needed to make the system viable. Secondary cities are in a similar situation. A \nstrategic  framework  for  urban  renewal  has  been  agreed  to  correct  this,  and  to  adopt  a \nsystematic approach. This is backed by a roadmap, policy framework and investment plan split \ninto  shorter  (immediate),  medium  (2011-2016)  and  long  term  (2017-2025)  interventions, \ncovering  both  physical  and  non  physical  requirements.  The  overall  investment  runs  into  $960 \nmillion  for  the  period  2011  to  2025  -an  average  capital  and  recurrent  expenditure  outlay  of \naround $70 million a year.  \n \n\n \n\nItem \n\nTable 1: Long term Sector Investment Program \n($ million) \nMedium \nTerm \n\nLong \nTerm \n\nTotal \n\nShort \nTerm \n55.5 \n\n1.1 \n\n3.4 \n\n322.6 \n\n11.2 \n\n36.2 \n\n465.7 \n\n15.1 \n\n49.2 \n\n843.7 \n\n27.4 \n\n88.9 \n\n960.0 \n\nShare of \nTotal (%) \n87.9 \n\n2.9 \n\n9.2 \n\n100.0 \n\n1.

The  government  has \nrequested Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB) assistance via an MFF. The strategic approach for \nurban renewal is fully consistent with ADB\u2019s interim operational strategy for Armenia8 and in line \n                                                 \n6   The system includes 2,800 microbuses operated by 65 companies on 118 microbus routes, 390 buses running on \n\n28 bus routes, and 50 trolleybuses running on 9 trolleybus routes. \n\n7  Twice as high as the municipal-owned operators. \n8  ADB.  2006.  Economic  Report  and  Interim  Operational  Strategy:  Armenia  (2006\u20132009).  Manila.  A  country \n\npartnership strategy is under preparation. \n\n\fwith ADB\u2019s own sustainable transport initiative and Strategy 2020.9 The existence of a strategy, \nroadmap,  policy  framework,  investment  program,  and  a  financing  plan  justifies  the  use  of  the \nMFF  in  this  case.  The  majority  of  the  investments  are  similar  in  size  and  fairly  repetitive  over \ntime. This means that the tranches do not involve very small investments at the start followed by \nlarge and complex ones later. The size of these investments is nonetheless larger than the one \nnormally identified with a sector loan modality. The sequence and location of these investments \nis  also  highly  predictable.  This  means  the  MFF  can  be  used  within  the  stipulated  period,  thus \nlimiting the timing of the so-called \u201cmoral financing obligation\u201d. A large stand-alone loan would \nresult  in  high  commitment  fees  to  the  client.  The  MFF  is  also  more  flexible  with  regard  to \nindividual tranche financing plans. Some tranches are expected to be co-financed with donors \nand  the  private  sector.  The  policy  reform  framework  is  already  in  place.  This  cuts  out  the \ndevelopment program loan approach. Finally, the MFF blends more easily physical investments \nwith  institutional  change.  It  can  also  accommodate  policy  revisions.  The  modality  is  thus  cost \neffective and provides a better basis for a longer term partnership in the sector.  \n \n8.    Coordination  with  development  partner  and  civil  society  organizations.  ADB  has \nconsulted key partners working in Armenia. It also consulted civil society organizations and the \nprivate sector. This coordination will continue during the implementation phase, including under \neach tranche of the MFF. Further, ADB chairs a partner coordinating committee covering urban \ntransport and other urban services. This will be invoked from time to time as needed. There is a \nbasic understanding among the partners and key civil society organizations on the investment \npriorities, institutional change and policy reforms required to ensure efficiency and effectiveness. \nADB  has  been  involved  in  urban  water  supply  in  the  country  since  2007,10 but  this  will  be  the \nfirst time it will do so in the urban transport area. Other donors are already active, namely the \nWorld Bank and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD).  The World \nBank  is  currently  discussing  with  authorities  a  $30  million  loan  for  parking  and  traffic \nmanagement. EBRD is working with the Yerevan municipality and the metro company.  The city \nalso  signed  in  early  2010  a  \u20ac15 million  loan  cofinanced  by  the  European  Union  and  the \nEuropean  Investment  Bank.  EBRD  and  ADB  are  jointly  financing  the  renovation  of  Yerevan \nZvartnots International Airport, a transaction led by the Private Sector Operations Department.11  \n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n9.    The  impact  of  the  MFF  will  be  an  improved  urban  environment,  a  stronger  economy, \nspearheaded  by  investments  in  cities  and  job  creation,  and  enhanced  private  sector \nparticipation in urban areas. The outcome will be improved urban transport infrastructure in 12 \nArmenian cities, leading to more efficient, reliable, safer and affordable services (Appendix 1). \n  \nC. \n\nOutputs \n\n10.  The MFF will support physical investments; greater institutional effectiveness; and project \nmanagement as outlined in Table 2 below. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n                                                 \n9  ADB, 2009.

It  is  understood  that  the  provision  of  any  such \nadditional  ADF  financing  will  be  accompanied  by  a  corresponding  reduction  of  the  available \nOCR financing (and vice-versa), so that in any event the total financing provided by ADB will not \nexceed the MFF amount of $400 million equivalent. Any additional ADF allocation will be subject \nto (i) the general availability of ADF resources from time to time, (ii) Armenia\u2019s access to such \nresources pursuant to ADB\u2019s then-applicable Graduation Policy13 and the requirements of ADF \ndonors, and (iii) the availability of such resources to Armenia pursuant to ADB\u2019s then-applicable \npolicy on performance-based allocation of ADF resources.14 OCR loans will have a term of up to \n25 years, including a grace period of up to 5 years, with interest to be determined in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility and such other terms \nand  conditions  set  forth  in  the  loan  and  project  agreements  for  each  tranche.  The  facility \nadministration manual shows the financial arrangements and indicative flow of funds. 15\n \n14.  Tranche 1, supported with a loan of about $50 million equivalent, focuses mainly on the \nconstruction of the ring road in Yerevan. This 4.5 km road will divert traffic from the city center \nand stimulate economic development in the outer areas of the city. It will be funded from ADB\u2019s \nSpecial Funds resources, with a 32-year term, including a grace period of 8 years, an interest \nrate of 1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter, and such other \nterms and conditions set forth in the loan and project agreements. The government will finance \nabout $12 million, mainly by paying for land acquisition, taxes and duties. The tranche will set \naside  funds  to  prepare  investment  projects  for  secondary  cities  including  Gyumri,  Jermuk, \nVanadzor,  and  Kapan.    ADB  will  finance  resettlement  expenses  on  a  case  by  case  basis, \nincluding under tranche 1, but not land acquisition. This action will enhance project readiness. \nThe government requested ADB\u2019s support in this area due to budgetary constraints, but more \nimportantly to accelerate the start of construction and project implementation as a whole. All the \nnecessary administrative arrangements for land acquisition and resettlement are captured in the \n\n \n\n                                                 \n12  Management is currently revising conditions for the use of the MFF.  Issues being tacked include a revised annual \nreport (to better capture performance and utilization), advance information on tranches (prior to their approval) and \nimproved arrangements for linked documents, including safeguards.  This MFF will apply the new conditions once \napproved. \n\n13  Currently: ADB. 2008. Review of the 1998 Graduation Policy of the Asian Development Bank. Manila. \n14  Currently:  ADB.  2004.

ADB  will  closely  monitor  the  process  to  ensure  full \ncompliance with safeguards requirements.  \n \n15.  Co-financing  and  Private  Sector  Development.  ADB  and  the  government  will  pay \nspecial attention to raising cofinancing from third parties, as well as funded risk participation by \nthe  private  sector.  The  MFF  will  also  focus  on  expanding  private  sector  participation  in  the \nmanagement  of  transport  and  other  urban  assets.  This  plan  will  require  continuous \nimprovements on legal and regulatory fronts as well as tariff setting and contracting modalities, \nprovisions for which are included in the roadmap. \n   \nE. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n16. \nInvestment  program  management.  The  Ministry  of  Economy  will  be  the  executing \nagency,  considering  the  program\u2019s  countrywide  coverage.16 Yerevan  municipality  will  be  the \nimplementing agency for tranche 1.  The Municipality will (i) manage, supervise, monitor day-to-\nday  implementation,  and  organize  procurement;  (ii)  provide  any  counterpart  assistance \nrequired;  and  (iii)  provide  oversight  on  the  implementation  of  environmental  and  social \nsafeguards. The entire program will be monitored by a government supervisory board.  This is \nto ensure full support from relevant ministries, municipalities and other agencies. The concerned \ncity  municipalities  will  implement  subsequent  tranches.  Implementation  arrangements  are \nsummarized in Table 5 and detailed in the facility administration manual. \n \n\nTable 5: Implementation Arrangements \n\nArrangements \n\nAspects  \nImplementation period  April 2011\u2013March 2020 (with completion estimated by 31 December 2020)\nManagement \n(i) Oversight body \n(ii) Executing agency \n(iii) Implementing \nagencies \n(iv) Implementation unit \nProcurement a \n\nSupervisory Board chaired by Prime Minister \nMinistry of Economy \nYerevan Municipality, and other implementing agencies to be designated by the \nSupervisory board for subsequent tranches \nExisting Yerevan Development PIU for tranche 1 with Project Management consultant  \nInternational competitive bidding for civil works  4 contracts \nInternational competitive bidding for goods  \nOverall project management (Procurement \nsafeguards, overall supervision and expertise)  \n\nConsulting services b \n\n$350 million \n$30 million \n$14 million \n\nEngineering and construction supervision \nconsultants (firm) \nAudit and advisory services \n\n1 contract \n1 contract; quality- and \ncost-based selection \n(QCBS) \n3 contracts (QCBS) \n\n50 person-months \n(individual and firm) \n\n$23 million \n\n$2 million \n\nRetroactive financing \nand/or advance \ncontracting \nDisbursement \n\nRetroactive financing is available for up to about $10 million (20% of tranche 1 loan) on \nadvance contracts for eligible expenditures (civil works, goods, and consulting services). \n\nLoan proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with the Loan Disbursement Handbook \n(2010, as amended from time to time) and detailed arrangements agreed upon between \nthe government and ADB. \n\na  Tentative amounts and packages referring to the proposed procurement plan.

Financial management. A financial management assessment and procurement capacity \nassessment confirmed that Yerevan municipality can deal with the implementation of tranche 1, \ngiven  its  past  experience  in  administering  donor  projects.  Other  cities  do  not  yet  have  such \ncapacity.  The  MFF  will  finance  training  on  ADB  procedures  for  them  including  on  safeguards, \nprocurement,  contract  management,  loan  disbursement  and  monitoring.  These  tasks  are \nalready planed in 2011. The Armenia Resident Mission will be closely involved in implementing \nthe entire MFF under the joint venture arrangement practiced in the department responsible for \nthe  region  -  Central  and  West  Asia  Department.  While  the  Resident  Mission  will  continuously \nreview MFF implementation, at least three formal loan review missions will be fielded every year \nwith  the  participation  of  headquarters  staff.  Annual  independent  audits  will  be  undertaken. \nDonors and civil society organizations will be briefed and consulted with regularly. Co-financing \nwill be sought for each tranche. \n \n18.  Contracting  Arrangements:  Contracting  arrangements  will  be  continuously  reviewed, \nrefined and revised to achieve maximum efficiency and cost effectiveness. Key features include: \n(i) Management: A firm will be recruited as a program manager to support, guide and manage \nthe  implementation  of  the  whole  MFF  with  the  implementing  agency  and  existing  PIU.  It  will \nsupport  all  aspects  of  MFF  management,  procurement,  safeguards  compliance,  and  oversight \non  the  supervision  consultants;  (ii)  Engineering  and  Supervision:  3  engineering  and \nsupervision contracts will be issued matching the different type of outputs (road, public transport \nand urban regeneration); (iii)  Civil  Works: 4 contracts are planned, including one for Yerevan \nbypass;  one  contract  for  the  construction  of  urban  roads  and  missing  links  in  the  secondary \ncities,  one  contract  for  public  transport  including  metro  and  other  public  modes,  and  one  for \nurban  regeneration  in  Yerevan  and  secondary  cities;  (iv)  Audit:  A  firm  will  be  recruited  to \nundertake  independent  financial  and  operational  audit;  (v)  Goods:  one  contract  will  be  issued \nfor  equipments  for  the  metro  extension  in  Yerevan.  Continuous  consultations  with  the  private \nsector and market surveys will be undertaken prior to each tranche. Subject to market feedback, \nsome of the civil works contracts will be designed on a turnkey basis comprising design as well \nas execution. A detailed procurement plan has been prepared for the first tranche, and tender \ndocuments are ready. \n \n19.  As the current metro system in Yerevan uses technology and equipment from the former \nSoviet Union, the government has requested a waiver to allow the procurement of some metro \nequipment from nonmember countries to ensure continuity and passenger safety.17 \n \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nA. \n\nTechnical \n\n20.  A  comprehensive  sector  strategy  and  roadmap  for  urban  transport  renewal  have  been \nprepared.  This  will  be  updated  during  the  MFF  implementation.  Technical  due  diligence, \nincluding preliminary designs, has been completed for the two subprojects included in tranche 1. \nFuture tranches will be approved only after preliminary or full designs are available. \n \n                                                 \n17 The  existing  metro  network  was  built  following  the  Soviet  metro  system  and  Soviet  standards.  Technical  due \ndiligence  has  shown  that  some  critical  components  of  the  signaling  and  energy  system  will  need  to  be  procured \nfrom  nonmember  countries  to  ensure  continuity  with  existing  metro  equipment  and  guarantee  proper  passenger \nsafety  in  the  tunnel  and  on  trains.  The  metro  company  has  traditionally  imported  such  items  from  nonmember \ncountries. The value of nonmember procurement is estimated at less than 15% of the total MFF and will happen in \ntranche 2 and in subsequent tranches. It will be detailed in the facility administration manual before each periodic \nfinancing  request.  ADB  member  countries  may  propose  alternative  technology,  but  switching  technologies  would \nbe too costly. All other components will be procured from ADB member countries. \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n21.  The  major  economic  benefits  accruing  from  projects  will  be  savings  in  travel  time  and \nvehicle operating cost per kilometer, and fewer traffic accidents.18 The analysis showed that the \ntwo subprojects are economically viable, with internal rates of return (EIRRs) of 14.4%\u201320.3% \nand estimated economic net present values of $4.8 million\u2013$17.2 million at a 12% discount rate. \nA sensitivity analysis confirmed this viability. A risk analysis indicated that the mean and median \nEIRRs,  though  lower  than  the  base  case  EIRRs,  were  above  12%.  In  tranche  1,  no  revenue-\ngenerating  projects  will  be  implemented,  so  no  financial  analysis  has  been  undertaken. \nEconomic and financial analysis will be conducted for all future projects under the MFF. \n \nC. \n\nGovernance \n\n22.  A financial management assessment was conducted for Yerevan municipality, a process \nthat will be replicated for all other cities during MFF implementation. The Yerevan municipality \nhas  adequate  capacity  to  manage  the  investment  program  and  project  implementation.  The \nprocurement assessment has demonstrated adequate capacity and systems to procure goods \nand  services  through  international  and  national  competitive  bidding  according  to  ADB \nProcurement Guidelines. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy was explained to and discussed with the \ngovernment  and  Yerevan  municipality.  Specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary \nmeasures on governance are described in the Facility Administration Manual.  \n \nD. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n23.  The  investments  will  have  a  direct  and  indirect  poverty  impact  on  people  across  the \ncountry. Tranche 1 investment on the Yerevan ring road will benefit 1.14 million people (34% of \nArmenia\u2019s  population  and  54%  of  its  urban  population).  The  investment  will  improve  living \nconditions, the urban environment and mobility. Potential beneficiaries are local residents, road \nand  public  transport  users  (including  students),  and  businesses,  who  will  benefit  from  greater \nmobility and connectivity. Tranche 1 will generate an estimated 400 jobs. Employment targets for \nlocal  unskilled  workers,  women,  and  vulnerable  groups  are  included  in  the  summary  poverty \nreduction and social strategy.19 The MFF as a whole will directly benefit over 2.1 million urban \nresidents  (64%  of  the  Armenian  population).  By  2025,  the  poor  will  benefit  through  (i)  better \naccess to the city and other activity centers, (ii) affordable transport alternatives for travelling in \nthe city, (iii) better living conditions and pollution reduction, (iv) employment opportunities in the \nconstruction  and  maintenance  of  road  projects  (more  than  1,000  jobs),  and  (v)  improved  job \nprospects  in  all  cities.  Tariff  and  subsidy  reform  and  an  integrated  ticketing  system  allowing \nsocial  and  concessionary  fares  for  the  microbus  system  will  guarantee  wide  mobility  for  the \npoor.  Road  construction  will  sustain  socioeconomic  development  and  promote  tourism  in \nYerevan, Jermuk, Dilijan, Tsakhkadzor and Sevan. \n  \n24. \nHealth. Health hazards from automotive pollution and traffic accidents will be reduced. \nCO2 emissions will be reduced. Reduced congestion, noise, and exhaust fumes, and expanded \ngreen and pedestrian areas will improve public health and the quality of life. Shorter travel time \nand better transport services will improve lives\u2014especially for women, the elderly, and children\u2014\nas  improved  road  and  public  transport  will  ease  access  to  social  services  such  as  universities, \nhospitals, and clinics. Awareness training on HIV/AIDS and sexually transmitted infections will be \nrequired in civil works bidding documents and monitored during implementation. \n\n                                                 \n18  Economic  Analysis  (accessible  from  the  list  of  linked  documents  in  Appendix  2);  ADB.  1997.  Guidelines  for  the \n\nEconomic Analysis of Projects. Manila. \n\n19  Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n\f25.  Gender impact. The MFF will have some gender benefits. It will improve women\u2019s access \nto  transport  services  and  enhance  their  rights  and  benefits.  The  gender  action  plan  has \nmeasures for boosting gender awareness; information sharing on HIV/AIDS risk; equal pay; and \nhygiene  promotion.  It  stipulates  training  for  all  implementing  agencies  through  gender  focal \npoints, and balanced representation in decision making in sector agencies.20 \n \nE. \n\nSafeguards \n\n26.  Environment.  An  environmental  assessment  and  review  framework  for  the  entire  MFF \nwas  approved  on  24  September  2010.  Tranche  1  project  is  classified  as  category  B,  and  two \ninitial  environmental  examinations  have  been  prepared.21 Tranche  1  subprojects  will  not  have \nsignificant  irreversible  negative  environmental  impacts  during  or  after  construction.22 Yerevan \nmunicipality  will  require  the  contractor  to  implement  the  environmental  management  plan \noutlined in the initial environmental examination and in the framework. The plan will be part of the \nconstruction contract.  With respect to the entire MFF, projects in cities with high tourism potential \nwith  national  parks  or  historical  heritage  sites  are  tentatively  categorized  as  \u201cA\u201d,  while  other \nprojects in Yerevan and other cities are categorized as \u201cB\u201d. ADB policies and procedures will be \nfollowed in each case. \n \n27.  Land acquisition and resettlement. To satisfy the requirements of national laws and the \nADB Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), a land acquisition and resettlement framework for the \nentire  MFF  was  approved  and  disclosed  on  24 September  2010  The  tranche  1  project  is \nclassified as resettlement category A. Both subprojects under tranche 1 involve land acquisition \nfor which two land acquisition and resettlement plans were approved on 24 September 2010.23 \nThe  impact  of  subproject  2  is  significant  as  more  than  200  individuals  will  be  relocated;  while \nthat  of  subproject  1  is  marginal.    With  respect  to  the  subsequent  tranches  of  the  MFF,  the \nprojects  involving  Yerevan  are  tentatively  classified  as  category  A,  while  those  in  other \nsecondary cities are classified as category B. \n \nIndigenous  peoples.  The  investment  program  areas  do  not  include  communities  that \n28. \nmay be defined as indigenous peoples under the ADB Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). The \nMFF and all tranche subprojects are classified as category C.  \n \nF. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n29.  The implementation risks are summarized in Table 6.  \n \n\nTable 6: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nRisks \nImplementing agency has limited experience with \nexternal financing. Insufficient procurement resources \nand cumbersome procurement process could delay \nimplementation. \nThe private sector may find the business environment \ncomplex and unstable; and other development \npartners\u2019 commitments may limit the availability of \ncontractors. \nFiscal constraints may delay or reduce counterpart \n\nMitigating Measures \nProject management consultants will be hired to streamline \nprocesses and improve project implementation. Individual \nconsultants will also support the implementing agencies. \nADB procurement and disbursement trainings are planned \nMarket surveys will be undertaken to refine the \nprocurement strategy. As ADB chairs the transport donor \ncoordination committee, it will consult with other partners to \nsmoothen contractor demands  \nCounterpart funds transferred to IA at the beginning of the \n\n                                                 \n20  Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n21 Initial Environmental Examination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).

Part of the resettlement costs will be financed by ADB \nMFF will assist in introducing output based subsidies and \ndevelop new sources of revenue. Public\u2013private \npartnerships will provide extra revenues \n\nCreation of a supervisory board chaired by the Prime \nMinister to ensure full dialogue and commitment \nPolicy dialogue and long-term engagement through MFF \nmodality will ensure strong commitment from authorities \nand compliance with technical subproject selection criteria  \n\nSources: Asian Development Bank project preparatory technical assistance consultant. \n \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n30.  The  government  has  assured  ADB  that  implementation  of  the  MFF  shall  conform  to  all \napplicable  ADB  policies  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures,  safeguards, \ngender,  procurement,  consulting  services,  and  disbursement  as  described  in  detail  in  the \nFacility  Administration  Manual  and  loan  documents.  The  government  has  given  ADB  certain \nundertakings  for  the  MFF,  which  are  set  forth  in  the  framework  financing  agreement.  Specific \ncovenants agreed by the government with respect to individual tranches under the MFF are set \nforth in the loan agreement and project agreement for the respective tranches. \n \n\nV. \n\nRECOMMENDATIONS \n\n31. \nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  multitranche  financing  facility  would  comply  with  the \nArticles  of  Agreement  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board \napprove the provision of loans under the multitranche financing facility in an aggregate principal \namount  not  exceeding  $400,000,000  equivalent  to  Armenia  for  the  Sustainable  Urban \nDevelopment Investment Program comprising \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nloans  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources,  with  interest  to  be  determined  in \naccordance  with  ADB's  then  applicable  policies  relating  to  Special  Funds \nresources, subject to conditions set forth in para. 13 of this report;  \nloans  from  ADB's  ordinary  capital  resources,  with  interest  to  be  determined  in \naccordance with ADB's London interbank offered rate-based lending facility; \n\nand such other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in \nthe framework financing agreement presented to the Board. \n \n32. \nI also recommend that the Board approve the proposal set forth in para. 19 of this report \nthat the metro equipment procured from nonmember countries of ADB be eligible for financing \nunder the investment program. If the requisite affirmative vote of directors representing not less \nthan two-thirds of the total voting power of ADB\u2019s membership, pursuant to article 14(ix) of the \nArticles of Agreement of ADB, is not obtained for this recommendation and the Board approves \nonly  the  recommendation  in  para.  31,  then  only  metro  equipment  procured  from  member \ncountries of ADB will be eligible for financing under the investment program. \n \n \n \n\nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n\n \n29 March 2011 \n\n \n\n\f \n\nDesign \nSummary \n\nImpact \nImproved \nurban \nenvironment, \nlocal economic \nconditions and \ngreater private \nsector within \nurban areas \n\nOutcome \nEfficient, \nreliable and \naffordable \nurban \ninfrastructure \nand services \nprovided in \nArmenian \ncities \n\nOutputs \nUrban \ninfrastructure \nextended, \nrehabilitated \nand improved \nin urban areas  \n\nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK FOR THE INVESTMENT PROGRAM \n\nPerformance Targets and Indicators \n\nData Sources and \nReporting Mechanisms \n\nAssumptions\nand Risks \n\nBy 2022, \nAir pollution due to urban transport declines by \n5% compared to 90% baseline in 2009. \n\nContribution of secondary cities to gross \ndomestic product increases to at least 35% \n(baseline 2009: 30%) \n\nPrivate investment in urban transport sector in \nArmenia increases at least by 10% compared \nto 2009 \n\nAccidents decline by at least 10%  (baseline \n2008: 407 fatalities and 3,125 injured) \n\nGovernment operational subsidy for public \ntransport declines by at least 10% compared \nto 64% in 2009 \n\nBy 2020, \nTravel time from South to North Yerevan \ndeclines by 40% compared to 45 minutes in \n2009 \n\nNational public transport modal split is \nmaintained at 21% (2008) \n\nShare of women using urban transport \nservices increases by at least 5% from 8.3 \nmillion in 2008 because of better security \n\nAt least 1,000 new jobs are created due to \nconstruction \n\nReport of multiple Indicators \nfrom municipal departments, \ncompanies and \nnongovernment \norganizations \n\nStatistical surveys (Ministry \nof Natural Protection, \nMinistry of Transport and \nTelecommunications, \nYerevan municipality, \nYerevantrans or other \nagencies) \n\nNongovernment \norganization, international \nand national transport \nassociations repost and \ndatabase \n\nMetro and trolleybus \ncompanies, Yerevan Trans \n\nMunicipality transport \nstatistics or other agencies \nas appropriate  \n\nStatistical Yearbook of \nArmenia  \n\nProject progress reports \n\nYerevan urban transport \nmaster plan published \n\nParticipating city website \nand communication \nmaterials \n\nMunicipal transport statistics \n\nYerevantrans, Metro \nCompany, Yerevan bus \ncompany annual reports  \n\nYerevan municipality reports \n\nSurveys conducted by the \nYerevan municipality \n\n \n\nBy 2016: \nCompletion of urban infrastructure: \n-5.3 km of road links constructed by Yerevan \nmunicipality;
