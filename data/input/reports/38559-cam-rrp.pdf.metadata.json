The  Project  focuses  on  enhancing  the  quality  of \neducation and will have no negative environmental impact.  \n \nThe  Project  will  help  the  Government  achieve  its  goal  of  poverty \nreduction  and  economic  development  by  providing  support  for \nenhancing  the  quality  of  education  through  institutional  capacity \ndevelopment  for  planning,  design,  and  delivery  of  education \nservices and by strengthening secondary education.  \n \nThe Government accords high priority to enhancing the quality of \neducation  to  make  the  education  system  more  efficient  and  to \nimprove \nthat \ninvestments  in  secondary  education  are  necessary  to  meet  the \ngrowing demand for a well educated and skilled work force. \n \nThe  impact  of  the  Project  will  be  an  increased  number  of  better \neducated  and  skilled  people  from  all  sections  of  Cambodia\u2019s \npopulation.  The  Project  will  achieve  this  by  carefully  targeting \nsupport  for  (i)  education  system  management  and  development, \n(ii)  professional  development  of  teachers,  and  (iii)  strengthening \nsecondary  education.  The  Project  outcome  will  be  improved \nquality  and  equity  of  education  in  Cambodia  with  more  effective \nsecondary  education,  improved  teacher  training,  and  stronger \neducation management systems. \n \nThe  investment  cost  of  the  Project  is  estimated  at  $33.38  million \nequivalent, including physical and price contingencies, taxes, and \nduties. \n \n\nlearning  achievements. \n\nrecognizes \n\nIt  also \n\n($ million) \n\nSource \nAsian Development Bank \nGovernment \n \n\nTotal \n\nTotal \n27.10 \n6.28 \n\n33.38 \n\n \n \n \n\n \n\n% \n81.20 \n18.80 \n\n100.00 \n\n \n\n    Source: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n\n\fThe Asian Development Bank (ADB) will provide a grant of $27.10 \nmillion,  or  81.2%  of  the  total  cost,  from  its  Special  Funds \nresources  to  help  finance  the  Project.

An additional 4,000 students will receive \nscholarships \ntotal \nscholarship beneficiaries, 60% will be females.  \n\nfor  upper  secondary  education.  Of \n\nthe \n\nThe indirect beneficiaries will include (i) current and future trainee \nteachers who will benefit from improvements in preservice teacher \ntraining  curriculum  and  methodologies;  (ii)  students  in  lower \nsecondary  and  upper  secondary  schools  (both  those  currently \nenrolled  and  in  the  future)  will  be  taught  by  better  trained  and \nmotivated  teachers  and  hence  will  have  more  relevant  skills  and \nknowledge  and  thus  be  more  employable;  (iii)  employers  and \npotential  employers  will  have  employees  with  more  relevant \nattitudes,  skills,  and  knowledge  which  will  reduce  the  need  for \ncostly  initial  training  of  recruits  and/or  returns  from  what  they \nundertake;  and  (iv)  higher-education  institutions  which  will  have \nbetter prepared applicants. \n\n \nThe  major  risk  stems  from  weak  institutional  and  management \ncapacity to implement the range of activities provided. The Project \nmitigates  this  risk  by  providing  (i)  consulting  services  for  all \nactivities  where  capacity  is  perceived  to  be  weak,  (ii)  adequate \ntime for activities to be completed satisfactorily, and (iii) a realistic \ntime frame for implementation over a 6-year period. \n \n\n \n\n\f103  00'Eo\n\n107  00'Eo\n\nCAMBODIA\nENHANCING EDUCATION QUALITY PROJECT\n\nLAO PEOPLE'S\nDEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC\n\no\n14  00'N\n\nTHAILAND\n\no\n14  00'N\n\nPoipet\n\nSisophon\n\nSIEM  REAP\n\nPREAH   VIHEAR\n\nODDAR  MEANCHEY\n\nSamrong\n\nBANTEAY\nMEANCHEY\n\nMongkol Borey\n\nPAILIN\n\nPailin\n\nBattambang\n\nBATTAMBANG\n\nMoung Roessei\n\nSiem Reap\n\nTonle\nSap\n\nCheom Ksan\n\nTbeng Meanchey\n\nSiem Pang\n\nSTUNG\nTRENG\n\nStung Treng\n\nRATANAKIRI\n\nBanlung\n\nLumphat\n\n.\nR\n \ng\nn\no\nk\ne\nM\n\nKOMPONG\nTHOM\n\nKompong Thom\n\nSambor\n\nMONDULKIRI\n\nSen Monorom\n\nKRATIE\n\nSandan\n\nKratie\n\nChhlong\n\nSnuol\n\nPrek Kak\n\nSre Khtum\n\nPursat\n\nKrakor\n\nPURSAT\n\nKompong Chhnang\n\nKoh Kong\n\nKOMPONG\nSPEU\n\nKompong Speu\n\nKOH  KONG\n\nSre Ambel\n\nSdok\nKOMPONG\nCHHNANG\n\nKompong Cham\n\nPhuni Tonle Bet\n\nMemot\n\nKOMPONG\nCHAM\n\nKrek\n\nPHNOM PENH\n\nPrey Veng\n\nTakmau\nKANDAL\n\nPREY\nVENG\n\nSVAY\nRIENG\n\nKompong\nTrabek\n\nSvay Rieng\n\nKaaong\n\nAngtassom\n\nTakeo\n\nKAMPOT\n\nTAKEO\n\nVeal Renh\n\nKampot\n\n Tani\n\nKep\n\nTuk Meas\n\nB\n\na\n\ns\n\ns\n\na\n\nc\n\n \n\nR\n\n.\n\nKEP\n\nSihanoukville\n\nSIHANOUKVILLE\n\nMekong R.\n\nVIET    NAM\n\nN\n\n0\n\n25\n\n50\n\n75\n\n100\n\nKilometers\n\no\n11  00'N\n\n103  00'Eo\n\n107  00'Eo\n\nSouth  China  Sea\n\nGulf   of   Thailand\n\nNational Capital\n\nProvincial Capital\n\nCity/Town\n\nNational Road\n\nOther Road\n\nRailway\n\nRiver\n\nProvincial Boundary\n\nInternational Boundary\n\nBoundaries are not necessarily authoritative.\n\no\n11  00'N\n\n0\n7\n-\n3\n2\n2\n9\n \nH\nR\n\n\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed grant \n\n1. \nto the Kingdom of Cambodia for the Enhancing Education Quality Project. \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nA. \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n2. \nCambodia\u2019s economy is experiencing rapid expansion. In 2006, gross domestic product \n(GDP)  growth  was  estimated  at  10.4%,  consolidating  double-digit  growth  of  the  previous  2 \nyears. The upturn is due to stronger industrial production and robust expansion in services and \nconstruction  activity.  Agricultural  production  expanded  by  a  stronger  than  expected  4.4%  from \nthe  record  levels  achieved  in  2005.  This  trend  in  strong  economic  growth  is  expected  to \ncontinue in the medium term.  \n \nA rapidly growing urban economy, together with approximately 74.2% of the population \n3. \nstill  employed  in  agriculture,  creates  a  dual  challenge  for  the  Government  in  meeting  the \nemerging  demand  for  a  qualified,  skilled,  and  competitive  work  force,  while  at  the  same  time \nbridging disparities in access to education and meeting its goals of universal primary education. \nTo meet this challenge, the Government is placing increasing emphasis on balancing the needs \nof  more  equitable  access  to  education  by  improving  the  quality  and  reach  of  secondary \neducation. \n \nThe  National  Strategic  Development  Plan  recognizes  education  as  a  crucial  factor  in \n4. \ndeveloping the country\u2019s human resources and endorses the Education Strategic Plan (ESP)\u2014a \n5-year  rolling  plan  for  developing  the  education  sector.  The  ESP  articulates  the  vision  of  the \nMinistry of Education, Youth and Sports (MoEYS) to \u201cestablish and develop human resources of \nthe  very  highest  quality  and  ethics  in  order  to  develop  a  knowledge  based  society  within \nCambodia.\u201d  The  ESP  defines  MoEYS\u2019  long-term  mission  as  ensuring  that  all  Cambodian \nchildren  and  youth  have  equal  opportunity  to  access  quality  education  consistent  with  the \nConstitution and the Government\u2019s commitment to the United Nations Convention on the Rights \nof  the  Child,  regardless  of  social  status,  geography,  ethnicity,  religion,  language,  gender,  or \ndisabilities. The ESP highlights three main policies: (i) equitable access to education services, \n(ii) quality and efficiency of education services, and (iii) institutional development and capacity \nbuilding  for  decentralization.  The  ESP  is  supported  by  an  Education  Sector  Support  Program \n(ESSP) which is reviewed annually in consultation with development partners and serves as the \naction plan to achieve the sector goals set out in the ESP. The ESSP identifies the necessary \nprogram activities and priorities in reaching the Cambodian Millennium Development Goals and \nthe  goals  set  out  in  the  Education  for  All  (EFA)  national  plan.  The  Government\u2019s  Rectangular \nStrategy for Growth, Employment, Equity and Efficiency includes capacity building and human \nresource  development  as  one  of  its  four  pillars,  with  enhancing  the  quality  of  education  being \nthe main feature.  \n \nThe current education system comprises primary (grades 1\u20136), lower secondary (grades \n5. \n7\u20139), and upper secondary (grades 10\u201312). Basic education is defined as grades 1\u20139. Entry to \nupper secondary level is regulated by a national examination at the end of grade 9. Technical \nand  vocational  education  programs  run  parallel  to  upper  secondary  programs  and  are  the \nresponsibility of the Ministry of Labor and Vocational Training.  \n \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nDespite  its  historical  disadvantage,  Cambodia  has  made  considerable  progress  in  the \n6. \nprovision  of  education.  In  2006\u20132007,  the  gross  enrolment  ratio  (GER)1 at  primary  level  was \n123% and the net enrolment ratio (NER)2 was 92.1%. This indicates a 13.5% increase against \nan NER of 77.8% in 1997\u20131998. During the same period, the GER for girls at the primary level \nincreased  from  81.2%  to  119.3%,  and  the  NER  for  girls  at  the  primary  level  increased  from \n72.4% to 91%. The impressive growth in enrolments at the primary level has led to high rates of \nincrease  in  enrolments  at  the  lower  and  upper  secondary  levels.  Since  1997\u20131998,  lower \nsecondary  enrolments  have  grown  by  135%  and  upper  secondary  enrolments  have  grown  by \n260%.  But,  despite  the  rapidly  growing  demand  for  secondary  education,  the  vast  majority  of \nchildren  of  secondary  school  age  are  still  not  enrolled  in  school.  The  GER  at  the  lower \nsecondary  level  is  60%,  and  at  the  upper  secondary  level  it  is  21.2%;  the  NER  at  the  lower \nsecondary level is 31.3%, and at the upper secondary level it is 11.3%. At the lower secondary \nlevel, the GER for girls is 54.5% and the NER for girls is 33.1%. At the upper secondary level \nthe  GER  for  girls  is  15.3%  and  the  NER  is  9.9%.  Despite  the  rapid  expansion,  overall \nenrolments at the secondary level are low, largely as a consequence of poor geographic access \nto lower secondary schools. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the World Bank are both \nsupporting  construction  of  lower  secondary  schools  and  together  will  provide  628  lower \nsecondary schools through their ongoing interventions.3 The impact of this on enrolments at the \nlower  secondary  level  will  be  felt  in  the  coming  years.  Meanwhile,  such  low  levels  of \nparticipation  in  secondary  education  are  a  severe  constraint  to  Cambodia\u2019s  economic \ndevelopment. \n\n7. \nExpansion  of  education  has  been  fueled  by  the  Government\u2019s  commitment  and \nextensive support from development partners, but the overall quality and efficiency of education \nremains a serious concern. Expansion of enrolments in primary schools has led to high student-\nteacher  ratios.  Drop  out  and  repetition  rates  remain  high.  Due  to  low  levels  of  enrolments, \nsecondary education has relatively higher graduation and lower drop out rates. Of the children \nwho enroll in grade 1, only 14.78% finish grade 12 within 12 years. Low enrolment rates at the \nsecondary  level,  as  well  as  a  low  percentage  of  students  completing  school,  is  a  cause  for \nconcern because the figures indicate large numbers of young people outside the school system \nand  therefore  unskilled  and  unemployable.  Across  the  school  system,  schools  have  poor \nphysical  infrastructure  and  inadequate  learning  materials,  laboratories,  and  libraries.  Teachers \nare  poorly  qualified,  inadequately  trained,  and  unmotivated.  Limited  resources  hamper  the \nGovernment\u2019s ability to effect major improvements, and the poor performance of the education \nsystem wastes already scarce resources.  \n \nGiven  the  rapidly  expanding  national  economy  and  the  global  trends  in  demand  for \n8. \neducation  at  all  levels,  the  education  sector  in  Cambodia  will  continue  to  experience  rapid \ngrowth  and  exert  pressure  on  MoEYS\u2019  management  capacity.  The  Project  will  strengthen \ninstitutional and management capacity through a variety of interventions, and target support for \nenhancing the quality of secondary education. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix \n1. \n \n\n                                                 \n1   GER refers to pupils enrolled from all age groups. \n2   NER refers to pupils enrolled from the eligible age group. \n3   ADB.  2004.

The  second  Education  Sector  Development  Program  will  provide  400  new  lower  secondary  schools. \nThe  Cambodia  Education  Sector  Support  Program,  supported  by  the  World  Bank,  will  provide  228  new  lower \nsecondary schools.  \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n3   \n\n \n\nB. \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\nAn analysis of the performance of the education sector is outlined below and provided in \n\n9. \nmore detail in Appendix 2. \n\n1. \n\nAccess and Equity \n\n10. \nSince 2001, equity of access to basic education has improved. Primary and secondary \nschool enrolment has increased by 30%, and there is greater participation by children from the \npoorest  families,  ethnic  minorities,  and  by  girls.  Many  additional  primary  and  lower  secondary \nclassrooms  have  been  built  to  improve  access.  Repetition  rates  have  also  fallen  in  the  lower \nprimary  grades.  However,  disparities  persist  based  on  gender,  ethnicity,  geographic  location, \nand economic background. At the primary level, the differentials in NER between urban (93.2%) \nand  rural  (92.2%)  areas  are  not  significant.  The  differences  are  more  marked  in  remote  and \ndisadvantaged  areas, 4 where  the  overall  NER  drops  to  73.2%.  Mondulkiri  (with  an  NER  of \n68.9%) and Ratanakiri (with an NER of 56.9%) have the lowest overall NERs. They also have \nthe highest rates of GER at 202.9% for Mondulkiri and 163.1% for Ratanakiri, indicating overage \nenrolments of 66% for Mondulkiri and 65.1% for Ratanakiri. Surprisingly, Mondulkiri has a high \ntransition  rate  to  lower  secondary  of  90.4%,  while  the  corresponding  figure  for  Ratanakiri  is \n72.6%. \n\nRural urban differentials for gender are not significant, with a marginally higher NER in \n11. \nrural areas (92.6%) than in urban areas (91.1%). However, in disadvantaged areas, the NER for \ngirls  drops  to  70.6%.  The  two  above-mentioned  provinces,  along  with  Otdar  Meanchey,  have \nvery high GER for girls at the primary level but among the lowest GER at the lower and upper \nsecondary levels. They also have the lowest NER for girls at all levels of school education. In \nboth  provinces,  the  transition  rates for  girls  (83.0%  in  Mondulkiri  and  83.2%  in  Ratanakiri) are \nhigher than the national average (78.7%). In fact, among female students, drop out rates reduce \nwith each successive grade completed. The NER of children at secondary education in remote \nand  disadvantaged  areas  is  much  lower  than  the  national  average.  Women  have  the  lowest \nrepresentation  in  the  teaching  force  in  the  disadvantaged  areas.  Thus,  while  children  in \ndisadvantaged areas are least likely to have access  to schools, a more critical examination of \nstatistics  indicates  that  the  children  who  do  obtain  access  to  schooling  are  likely  to  use  the \nopportunity reasonably well.  \n\n2. \n\nQuality \n\na. \n\nCurriculum \n\n12.  MoEYS  approved  a  policy  in  December  2005  and  master  plan  for  curriculum \ndevelopment  for  the  period  2005\u20132009.  Since  then,  processes  for  developing  and  introducing \nnew curricula have been underway; the Pedagogic Research Department (PRD) is responsible \nfor  curriculum  development,  MoEYS  has  received  support  from  the  United  States  Agency  for \nInternational Development (USAID) for review of curriculum for basic education (all subjects for \ngrades 1\u20139), and from the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) in mathematics and \nthree science subjects at upper secondary level (grades 10\u201312). At the secondary level to date, \nnew  curricula  have  been  developed  for  lower  secondary  Khmer,  mathematics,  social  studies, \nand sciences, and for upper secondary mathematics, biology, chemistry, and physics.  \n\n                                                 \n4   A  disadvantaged  area  is  a  location  where  one  of  the  following  conditions  applies:  poor  transport  infrastructure, \npopulation density of less than 10 persons per square kilometer, regularly flooded areas and/or areas vulnerable to \nnatural disasters, integrated areas and/or border areas, and areas that have an insufficient number of schools of all \nlevels. \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\nProgress in developing curricula in areas that are not supported directly by donors has \n13. \nbeen slow due to the lack of technical support to inform and guide the process, as well as the \ncompeting  demands  on  PRD  staff.  Curricula  need  to  be  revised  for  the  traditional  civics \nsubjects,  foreign  languages  (English  and  French),  and  for  the  proposed  Elective  Vocational \nEducation Program (EVEP) subjects which are being introduced.  \n\n14. \nPRD needs support to strengthen its professional curriculum development capacity. The \ncurrent  phasing  of  introducing  the  new  curriculum  needs  to  be  adjusted  to  accommodate \nseveral dimensions in order to optimize the benefits from support for strengthening institutional \ncapacity.  The  dimensions  include  (i)  curriculum  coherence  across  years,  (ii)  efficient  and \neffective curriculum development, (iii) orientation of schools and teachers to the new curriculum, \n(iv) minimizing the disruption to students and teachers during introduction of the new curriculum, \n(v) implications for preparing learning materials to support the new curriculum, (vi) integration of \nthe  new  curriculum  with  the  preservice  teacher  training  curriculum  as  well  as  with  student \nexamination and assessment, and (vii) a schedule for curriculum reviews. \n\nb. \n\nAssessment \n\n15. \nThe assessment and examination system has benefited from support from the Australian \nAgency  for  International  Development  (AusAID).  However,  the  system  still  needs  significant \nstrengthening  since  it  is  not  fully  standards-based  and  lacks  coherence.  The  Government  is \ndesigning  assessment  against  curriculum  standards  for  grades  3,  6,  and  9.  To  complete  this \nsystem,  curriculum  standards  (and  also  grade  criteria)  need  to  be  developed  for  grade  12.  A \nclear  relationship  between  school-based  assessment  in  grades  1  and  2  and  assessment  of \ncurriculum  standards  in  grade  3  (and  for  subsequent  grades  up  to  grade  9)  needs  to  be \nestablished so that there is coherent reporting on student progress. The new system of national \nassessments (standardized tests at grades 3, 6, and 9 in Khmer and mathematics, applied to a \nsample  of  the  student  population  to  assess  learning  achievement)  needs  to  be  supported  in \napplying  the  curriculum  standards  by  using  similar  items  to  those  used  in  schools  to  assess \nthese  curriculum  standards.  Complementarities  need  to  be  established  between  school-based \nassessment  and  the  current  examination  system.  The  Examinations  Office  lacks  capacity  to \nundertake these reforms and needs a phased strengthening with the introduction of information \nand  communication  technology  (ICT)-led  improvements  for  management  of  assessment, \nadministration, and record keeping.  \n\nc. \n\nTextbooks and Learning Materials \n\n16.  MoEYS\u2019 stated policy is to ensure adequate provision of core instructional materials  and \nto  encourage  the  process  of  widening  the  choice  and  therefore  the  quality  in  the  provision  of \ntextbooks by opening the textbook market to supply by multiple publishers. This is expected to \nallow  more  flexibility  in the  purchase  of  core  learning  materials  at  the school level  with  quality \nand cost benefits for MoEYS. In practice, this has not happened because copyright is vested in \nthe Publishing and Distribution House (PDH) and pricing issues have kept other publishers out \nof the textbook publishing business. Centralized procurement also contributes to serious delays \nin  provision  of  textbooks.  Lack  of  textbooks  is  a  major  obstacle  to  student  learning.  Inputs  for \nstrengthening  quality  of  education  can  only  have  impact  if  the  complex  issues  relating  to \nprovision of textbooks are resolved as a matter of the highest priority.  \n\nPRD  is  responsible  for  putting  textbook  writing  and  production  out  to  tender  and \n17. \nsupporting  interested  publishers  with  specifications,  information,  and  guidance  to  enable  them \nto  develop  material  suitable  for  submission  to  the  MoEYS  textbook  approval  process.  PRD  is \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n5   \n\n \n\nalso  responsible  for  ensuring  that  learning  materials  are  developed  on  time  and  in  line  with \ncurriculum requirements. PRD will play a key role in implementing MoEYS\u2019 policy on textbook \ndevelopment and needs support to be able to do this effectively.   \n\nd. \n\nTeacher Quality \n\n18. \nThe  low  quality  of  teaching  is  a  major  reason  for  the  poor  quality  of  education.  Low \nentry-level qualifications and inadequate training (or no training at all) are the most basic causes \nof  poor  teaching  quality.  Of  the  approximately  25,520  teachers  at  the  lower  and  upper \nsecondary level, about 14,400 are considered underqualified. Poor motivation of both teachers \nand trainers, and inadequate support and supervision, also contribute to poor teaching quality. \nThe  following  interventions  are  considered  necessary  for  improving  the  quality  of  teacher \ntraining and professional development: (i) strengthening the capacity of teacher training colleges \n(TTCs) to improve teacher skills and competencies; (ii) strengthening in-service teacher training \nto  improve  the  quality  of  classroom  teaching;  and  (iii)  a  strategy  for  professional  development \nthat addresses, among other issues, a financial and nonfinancial incentive structure.  \n \n19. \nThe ESSP prioritizes a staff development program for TTCs and a responsive preservice \nand in-service teacher training program to enhance the capacity of teachers and trainers. These \nprograms  are  linked  to  the  introduction  of  teacher  standards,  teacher  training  standards,  and \nimproved systems of performance monitoring. The ESSP proposes a formal certification system \nas a foundation for the development of the national teacher education system. To achieve this, \ncriteria  and  procedures  need  to  be  developed  for  assessing  competencies  and  certification  of \ncourses that teachers and trainers attend. A training needs-analysis for teachers has identified \nthe  following  competencies  that  need  strengthening:  (i)  institutional  management  skills,  (ii)  the \nability  to  develop  and  use  ICT  multimedia,  (iii)  English  language  skills,  and  (iv)  upgrading  of \nunderqualified teachers in secondary schools. All teacher training programs need to be planned \nand coordinated to ensure that (i) duplication with other development  initiatives is avoided, (ii) \nfuture planned activities complement and strengthen current interventions, and (iii) the system \nhas  the  capacity  to  absorb  the  training  activities  on  the  scale  planned.  Since  teacher  salaries \nconsume  a  large  percentage  of  the  budget  for  education,  improvements  in  teacher  quality  will \nsignificantly improve resource efficiencies. \n \n\ne. \n\nInstitutional Capacity \n\n20.  Weak functional capacity in the education system continues to be a barrier to achieving \nthe  goal  of  universal  primary  education  and  enhancing  education  quality.  MoEYS  has  been \noverstretched  in  its  administrative,  planning,  and  policy  formulation  functions.  Development \npartners have provided support for building capacity, but this support has been constrained by \ninadequate staff  development,  poor  facilities,  and  lack of  effective  leadership.  Besides,  rapidly \nexpanding  primary  education,  supported  by  the  national  and  international  focus  on  universal \nprimary  education,  has  absorbed  much  of  the  resources.  Lower  secondary  education,  with  its \ninclusion  in  basic  education,  is  beginning  to  receive  attention;  secondary  education  has \nremained a neglected subsector. TTCs have received only sporadic support and lack adequate \nfacilities  such  as  libraries  and  laboratories.  These  weaknesses  have  resulted  in  weak  and \ninefficient  implementation  of  policies,  and  inadequate  capacity  for  meeting  the  demands  for \nmanagement and teacher training.  \n \n21.  Management information systems (MISs) remain weak in MoEYS. Mechanisms for data \ngathering  and  manipulation  are  minimal  at  the  point  of  collection.  MISs  often  do  not  have  the \ncapacity to interconnect with one another, not only because the basic data sets are incompatible \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\nbut also because the staff lack the analytical skills. Where they exist, basic data sets are held \nwithin  systems  which  are  associated  with  a  specific  entry.  Currently  MoEYS  has  a  number  of \ninformation  systems:  the  education  MIS,  centered  in  the  MoEYS  Department  of  Planning;  the \nfinancial MIS in the Department of Finance, and a human resources MIS in the Department of \nPersonnel. The education MIS system does not interrelate with either the human resources or \nfinancial  MIS.  The  human  resources  MIS  is  supported  by  the  United  Nations  Children's  Fund \n(UNICEF)  and  the  European  Union,  and  the  education  MIS  is  supported  by  UNICEF  and  the \nSwedish  International  Development  Cooperation  Agency  (Sida).  Other  systems  that  already \nexist  or  are  planned  relate  to  school  construction,  nonformal  education,  higher  education,  and \nthe Department of Information and ASEAN Affairs. \n  \n\nf. \n\nFinancing for Education \n\n22. \nEducation\u2019s  share  of  the  national  budget  has  increased  from  13.6%  in  2000  to  an \nexpected  19.2%  in  2007.  During  the  same  period,  allocations  to  education  in  absolute  terms \nincreased  from  KR183.2  billion  to  KR546  billion.  Education  expenditures  as  a  percentage  of \nGDP  increased  from  1.2%  in  2000  to  1.93%  in  2007.  Despite  the  increases,  the  share  of \neducation in national spending remains low compared with other developing countries.  \n\n \n23. \nThe education sector receives substantial financing from development partners. During \nthe period 2005\u20132010, committed external funding is estimated at $327.6 million, without taking \ninto  account  any  further  commitments  that  may  be  made  by  development  partners.  A  large \nnumber  of  donors  support  the  education  sector  with  ADB,  the  World  Bank,  European \nCommission and the United Nations agencies being the biggest donors. Resource requirements \nto  successfully  achieve  the  objectives  set  out  in  the  ESP  2006\u20132010  are  estimated  at  $864 \nmillion. Despite projections for robust economic growth, the Government will not be able to meet \nthese  resource  requirements  and  will  continue  to  depend  on  external  assistance  to  augment \nresources.  \n \n\n3. \n\nGovernment Objectives and Strategic Policies \n\n24. \nThe Government\u2019s Rectangular Strategy for Growth, Employment, Equity and Efficiency \nstates  that  the  government  will  continue  to  increase  budget  expenditures,  and  mobilize \nincreased  international  assistance  to  (i)  provide  incentives  for  teachers;  (ii)  assure  quality \ninstruction;  (iii)  provide  educational  materials,  equipment,  libraries,  and  laboratories;  (iv)  build \ndormitories for students, especially female students; (v) continue to reform curricula and training \nprograms; (vi) provide scholarships to poor students; (vii) promote informal education programs; \n(viii) finance construction of schools in rural areas; and (ix) support school operating costs. \n\n25. \nThe  Government\u2019s  various  aspirational  goals  for  expansion  of  education  opportunities \nare  reflected  in  the  ESP,  which  was  the  first  step  towards  adopting  a  sectorwide  strategy  for \neducation development. The ESSP outlines how strategies laid out by the ESP will be put into \npractice.  It emphasizes strengthening appropriate MoEYS departments at central and provincial \nlevels,  including  delegation  of  responsibilities  to  districts,  clusters  and/or  communes,  and \nschools. The Government\u2019s Framework for Decentralization and Deconcentration reinforces the \ndistribution of responsibilities and resources to provincial and municipal levels. The Government \nalso accords the highest priority to the EFA national plan.  \n\nIn  2006,  the  Council  of  Ministers  approved  the  draft  Education  Law  which  has  been \n26. \nsubmitted  to  the  National  Assembly  for  ratification.  Under  the  Education  Law,  a  National \nCouncil  for  Education  will  be  established  to  promote  the  development  of  the  education \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n7   \n\n \n\nsector.  MoEYS  has  also  prepared  the  Policy  and  Strategies  on  ICT  in  Education  (2004),  the \nGender  Mainstreaming  Strategy  in  Education  (2006\u20132010),  and  the  Policy  for  Curriculum \n(2005\u20132009),  and  provided  guidelines  for  the  integration  of  these  policies  into  the  broader \nprocess of education reform.  \n\n4. \n\nADB\u2019s Sector Strategy \n\n27. \nADB\u2019s  strategy  in  the  education  sector  in  Cambodia  has  evolved  to  emphasize \nstrengthening  the  investments  made  during  past  projects  and  building  upon  them  to  move \ntowards  more  integrated  support  for  the  education  sector.  Through  the  first  Education  Sector \nDevelopment Program (ESDP I),5 approved in 1999, ADB provided program support for (i) the \nGovernment\u2019s  priority  action  program,  (ii)  expanding  access  to  primary  education,  and  (iii) \ncurriculum  and  textbook  development.  The  second  Education  Sector  Development  Program \n(ESDP  II),6 approved  in  2004,  continued  the  support  for  policy  reforms  but  shifted  support  for \nexpanding  access  to  lower  secondary  education  through  school  facilities  development.  The \nESDP II also provides for construction of 24 new upper secondary schools and 25 model upper \nsecondary  schools.  It  also  included  technical  assistance  (TA)  for  planning  for  secondary \neducation  development.7 ADB  has  also  supported  policy  reform,  governance,  and  regulatory \nreform  for  decentralization  of  education  through  an  advisory  TA  project8 linked  to  the  second \neducation  program.  ADB  provided  assistance  for  expanding  access  to  primary  education  for \nchildren  from  remote  and  disadvantaged  areas  and  for  upgrading  primary  schools  that  do  not \noffer  a  full  5-year  cycle of  primary  schooling.  ADB\u2019s  support  to  the  education sector  has  been \nfully consistent with Government priorities as enunciated in the ESP. The proposed Project will \nprovide  much-needed  support  for  systemwide  strengthening  of  institutional  capacity  for  quality \neducation. It will also expand and strengthen secondary education, which is now recognized as \nkey to national economic development.  \n \n\n5. \n\nExternal Assistance to Education  \n\n28. \nDevelopment agencies provide substantial support to the education sector in Cambodia. \nThe  World  Bank  and  ADB  are  the  two  major  funding  agencies  and,  from  2002  to  2007,  will \ntogether account for 42% of the total external funding for education. Other agencies supporting \neducation include the European Commission, JICA, Sida, the United Nations Populations Fund \n(UNFPA),  UNICEF,  and  USAID.  The  World  Bank\u2019s  support  has  been  targeted  at  primary  and \nlower  secondary  education.  The  European  Commission  has  provided  budgetary  support  with \ntechnical  assistance  to  strengthen  public  financial  management.  USAID  has  supported \ncurriculum  development  at  the  primary  level.  JICA  support  has  targeted  teacher  training  and \ncurriculum development for science and mathematics at the secondary level.  \n \n\n                                                 \n5   ADB.  2001.

(Loans  2121/2122-CAM,  program  loan  for  $20  million  and  project  loan  for  $25  million,  approved  on  9 \nDecember). \n\n7   The  focus  of  secondary  education  development  was  on  providing  access  through  the  expansion  of  secondary \neducation.  The  Project  provides  complementary  support,  focusing  on  quality  aspects  of  secondary  education \ndevelopment. \n\n8   ADB. 2004. Technical Assistance to the Kingdom of Cambodia for Education Regulatory Reform and Governance \n\nfor Decentralization. Manila.  \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nExternal assistance to the sector is channeled within the ESP framework. Donors have \n29. \nused different modalities to provide support\u2014ADB has used sector development programs, the \nWorld  Bank  has  used  the  project  modality,  and  the  European  Commission  has  provided \nbudgetary support. There are no large multidonor cofinanced projects in the education sector in \nCambodia. The donor coordination mechanism has strengthened over the years but modalities \nof  assistance  have  been  determined  by  the  extensive  needs  of  the  sector  and  constrained  by \nboth donor and government capacity. This project has been designed to target interventions at \nspecific areas that need strengthening in order to improve the quality of learning outcomes. The \nproject  is  fully  consistent  with  the  Government\u2019s  emphasis  on  enhancing  the  quality  of  school \neducation and addresses key areas highlighted in the ESP and ESSP. The links with the ESSP \nare highlighted in Supplementary Appendix B. The Project is also consistent with ADB\u2019s country \nstrategy  program  for  Cambodia, 9  which  recognizes  that  quality  of  education  needs  to  be \nimproved at all levels. An analysis of external assistance is in Appendix 3. \n \n\n6. \n\nLessons Learned \n\nin \n\nterms  of \n\nfor  knowledge  and  skills \n\nValuable lessons have been drawn from projects and programs that have supported the \n30. \neducation sector in the past. The generic lessons include that (i) rapid expansion of access to \nprimary schooling is putting great pressure on secondary education, which needs attention; (ii) \nemphasis  on  expansion  needs  to  be  matched  by  emphasis  on  quality;  (iii)  an  organizational \nframework for in-service teacher training which is linked to the preservice TTCs is needed; (iv) \nprovision of facilities needs careful planning in order to ensure optimum utilization of resources; \n(v)  institution  building  needs  flexible  inputs  and  a  thorough  analysis  of  institutional  needs;  (vi) \nprofessional  development  activities  must  be  specific \nintended  outputs, \ncompetencies,  certification,  and  career  development  opportunities;  (vii)  adequate  technical \nassistance  needs  to  be  provided  for  strengthening  capacity;  and  (viii)  experts  need  to  work \nclosely  with  counterparts \ntransfer  and  reduce  dependency \n(Supplementary Appendix A).  \n \n31. \nDespite the extensive assistance to the sector, the scope of the education reforms has \nexceeded  the  capacity  of  MoEYS.  Institutional  and  systemic  weaknesses  have  not  received \nadequate  attention,  and  the  capacity  of  the  education  system  to  absorb  new  concepts  is \nconstrained by weak capacity. Experience from ADB-supported projects indicates that (i) due to \ncapacity constraints, the policy and program reforms had to be supported by diverting technical \nassistance provided for other activities, (ii) many recommendations of the technical assistance \nprovided  under  the  ESDP  I  could  not  be  implemented  due  to  systemic  weaknesses,  and  (iii) \nsupport for strengthening capacity needs to be carefully designed to ensure longer-term benefits \nto the system.  \n  \n32. \nThe preparation of the Project has been guided by the Government\u2019s education policies, \nin-depth  subsector  analysis,  and  the  lessons  learned  from  experience.  The  Project  places \nsignificant emphasis on (i) policy coherence, (ii) building management and institutional capacity, \nand  (iii)  strengthening  the  quality  and  reach  of  secondary  education.  The  Project  provides \nadequate  technical  assistance  to  support  all  proposed  activities  to  ensure  that  they  are \nimplemented  satisfactorily.  It  also  proposes  an  implementation  structure  comprising  technical \nunits  for  each  component  to  promote  ownership  and  encourage  skills  transfer  and  capacity \nbuilding through partnership with technical experts.  \n \n\n                                                 \n9   ADB. 2005.

The Project aims to strengthen the quality of \nschool  education  by  carefully  targeting  support  for  (i)  education  system  management  and \ndevelopment,  (ii)  professional  development  of  teachers,  and  (iii)  strengthening  secondary \neducation.  A  key  underlying  aspect  of  all  proposed  activities  is  strengthening  the  capacity  of \ninstitutions  and  agencies  responsible  for  delivery  of  quality  education.  This  includes  (i) \nexamining  the  capacity  of  effectiveness  of  MoEYS\u2019  organizational  structure,  (ii)  supporting \ncapacity building of NIE and TTCs, and (iii) strengthening and integrating the MISs. The Project \nwill  provide  extensive  support  for  improving  teacher  quality  and  management,  including \nupgrading facilities of the TTCs and enhancing competencies of teacher trainers. The quality of \nsecondary education will be strengthened through (i) improved secondary school management; \n(ii)  upgraded  facilities  including  libraries  and  science  and  ICT  laboratories;  (iii)  provision  of \ntextbooks; and (iv) improved secondary school curriculum, assessment, and examinations. \n \n34. \nThe Project outcome will be improved quality and equity of education in Cambodia with \nstronger  education  management  systems,  improved  teacher  competencies,  and  effective \nsecondary education.  \n \nB. \n\nOutputs \n\nThe Project outputs and supporting activities are detailed below.   \n\n35. \n \n\n1. \n\nEducation System Management and Development \n\nThe objective of this component is to strengthen institutional capacity of MoEYS for more \n36. \nefficient  management  and  delivery  of  education  services.  This  will  be  achieved  through  the \nfollowing actions. \n \nDissemination of the Education Law and Gender Mainstreaming Policy. The Project \n37. \nwill  support  dissemination  of  the  law  upon  its  adoption  by  the  National  Assembly  through \ndistribution of  printed  copies  to  schools,  district  and  provincial  offices, and  other  stakeholders. \nMaterials  designed  for  display  in  schools  and  other  public  places  will  be  distributed  to  create \nwider awareness of the provisions of the law. A national workshop will be conducted for senior \nnational and provincial officials of MoEYS and other key ministries to familiarize them with the \nprovisions of the education law. The Project will also support dissemination of MoEYS\u2019 Gender \nMainstreaming  Policy  to  schools  and  MoEYS  offices  and  institutions  at  the  district,  provincial, \nand national level.   \n \n38. \nPolicy  Framework  for  Teacher  Education  and  Teacher  Management.  The  Project \nwill assist MoEYS to prepare a policy framework that integrates policies and strategies related \nto  teacher  recruitment,  deployment,  qualifications,  professional  development,  and  career \ngrowth,  and  encompasses  five  strategic  areas:  (i)  management  of  the  teacher  education \nsystem,  (ii) \nteacher  education  methodology,  (iii)  a  system  of  continuing  professional \ndevelopment,  (iv)  teacher  recruitment  and  retention,  and  (v)  financial  and  nonfinancial \nincentives for teachers. \n \n \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\nStrengthening  the  National  Institute  of  Education.  The  Project  will  support  NIE  to \n39. \nexamine  different  institutional  models  and  identify  a  suitable  model  for  its  own  long-term \ninstitutional growth so that future support can be targeted in a way that develops NIE\u2019s capability \nto  provide  leadership  on  issues  of  education  quality.  The  Project  will  also  support  NIE  to  (i) \ndevelop  an  institutional  development  plan  with  a  clear  vision  for  the  next  10  years,  (ii) \nstrengthen education research capacity, (iii) enhance staff professional capacity, (iv) establish a \nmultimedia  center,  (v)  develop  training  programs  for  management  and  planning,  and  (vi) \nimplement outreach activities for upper secondary teachers. \n \n40. \nReview  of  the  Roles  and  Functions  of  MoEYS  at  the  Central,  Provincial,  District, \nand  School  Levels.  The  proposed  review  will  consider  MoEYS\u2019  changing  role  resulting  from \nthe  implementation  of  the  decentralization  and  deconcentration  strategy.  The  review  will \nconsider the management, educational, and administrative functions of MoEYS, and the internal \nstructure of the departments to address problems of coordination, communication, overlap, and \nlinkages.  The  review  will  include  the  organization  and  functions  of  the  provincial  and  district \noffices and TTCs, and will be supported by recommendations for rationalizing the organizational \nstructures.  \n \n41. \nStrengthening  Information  Systems.  A  task  force  will  be  formed  to  develop  clear \nguidelines for the use of information for education planning and to develop an implementation \nplan  to  fully  integrate  the  education,  human  resources,  and  finance  MISs.  The  Project  will \nsupport  strengthening  statistical  analysis,  general  performance  and  quality  indicators,  and \nqualitative  reporting  for  the  education  MIS.  The  Project  will  ensure  that  the  finance  MIS  is \ncompatible with the Ministry of Economy and Finance system. The human resources MIS will be \nInformation,  education,  and \nsupported \ncommunication  capacity  at  the  Department  of  Information  and  ASEAN  Affairs  will  be \nstrengthened to enable it to play a coordinating role in the dissemination of information. \n \nEstablishing  Monitoring  and  Quality  Assurance  Systems.  The  Project  will  assist \n42. \nMoEYS to define the roles and responsibilities of its key departments in monitoring and quality \nassurance activities of the inspectorate general, and departments of Teacher Training, Primary, \nand Secondary Education. The self-assessment system for schools will be expanded to include \nlower  secondary  and  upper  secondary  schools.  A  similar  self-assessment  system  will  be \nintroduced in the TTCs. Institutional and management capacity will be strengthened to improve \nthe  monitoring  and  quality  assurance  systems  by  linking  them  to  the  identification  of  training \nneeds.  The  professional  competencies  of  secondary  school  inspectors  will  be  strengthened. \nFunctions  and  performance  of  the  Committee  on  Continuous  Teacher  Development  will  be \nreviewed with the objective of strengthening its role in quality assurance. Teacher standards will \nbe linked to the identification of teacher professional development needs. Teacher quality will be \nmonitored using teacher profiles10 and school self-assessment tools. \n \n43. \nEnhancing  Capacity  of  the  Pedagogic  Research  Department  and  the  Education \nMaterials  Approval  Board.  The Project will support PRD to develop a system to manage the \nprocess of textbook development in accordance with MoEYS policies. PRD will draw up detailed \nprocurement  briefs  to  enable  MoEYS  to  invite  private  publishers  to  develop  books  to  the \nrequired  specifications.  PRD  will  be  the  executing  body  of  the  existing  Prequalification, \nEvaluation  and  Award  of  Contract  Committee  and  Education  Materials  Approval  Board,  which \nwill ensure transparency and quality in book selection.  \n\nthrough  upgrade  of  equipment  and  materials. \n\n                                                 \n10 Complementary to the development of teacher profiles for  primary and  lower secondary levels, profiles for upper \nsecondary teachers will be developed under the Project as part of secondary school management development.  \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n11   \n\n \n\nUnder  MoEYS\u2019  policy  on  textbook  development,  PRD  will  have  a  continuing  direct \n44. \nrelationship  with  the  textbook  drafting  and  approval  process,  and  in  managing  and  guiding \ntextbook  developers.  The  Project  will  support  capacity  building  of  PRD  by  enabling  staff  to \ndevelop  necessary  skills  to  draft  procurement  documents,  write  specimen  materials,  and \ncommission books to be supplied by the private sector to strict specifications, and to organize \ntransparent book evaluation at all levels.  \n\n2. \n\nProfessional Development of Teachers \n\nThe  objective  of  this  component  is  to  strengthen  teacher  competencies.  This  will  be \n\n45. \naccomplished through the following actions.   \n\nEnhancing Management Capacity of Teacher Training Institutions. The Project will \n46. \nsupport several measures to strengthen TTCs. A framework of teacher training standards linked \nto  the  development  of  a  teacher  education  policy  will  be  developed.  The  teacher  training \nstandards  will  provide  a  benchmark  for  performance  monitoring  of  quality  in  teacher  training. \nThe  institutional  capacity  of  NIE  and  TTCs  will  be  strengthened  through  a  management \nleadership training program for directors and deputy directors of these institutions to implement \n(i)  quality  standards,  (ii)  institutional  improvement  planning,  (iii)  curriculum  review  procedures, \nand (iv) performance monitoring of quality in teacher training. This leadership training course will \nalso include building professional research capacity within each faculty.  \n\nStrengthening \n\n47. \nIn-Service  Teacher  Training  Curriculum  and  Performance \nMonitoring.  Systematic  procedures  will  be  introduced  to  incorporate  changes  to  the  school \ncurriculum into the preservice teacher training program and to ensure that appropriate teaching \nand  learning  methodology  is  used  in  the  delivery  of  the  curriculum.  The  Teacher  Training \nDepartment  (TTD)  will  be  involved  in  the  review  of  in-service  teacher  training  programs  to \nensure  consistency  in  content  and  methodology.  The  revised  teacher  training  curriculum  will \ninclude action research as a training and professional development methodology. The quality of \nteacher  training  programs  will  be  further  enhanced  by  implementing  an  improved  system  of \nteacher  training  performance  monitoring,  including  a  review  of  the  methods  used  in  the \nassessment of student teacher competencies, and teacher trainer competencies. The quality of \nteacher training programs will be evaluated against teacher training standards.  \n\nUpgrading Facilities of TTCs. Facilities of NIE and all TTCs11 will be improved through \n48. \nneeds-based  construction  and  rehabilitation  of  buildings,  and  provision  of  learning  facilities \nand/or materials. An assessment of existing and planned physical facilities will be undertaken to \nidentify  the  requirement  of  each  TTC.  Learning  centers  comprising  a  library  and  multimedia \ncenter, a computer lab, and a science laboratory will be provided or upgraded in all 26 TTCs.12 \nTeacher  trainers  and  trainee  teachers  will  be  provided  resources  to  develop  skills  in  practical \nteaching and learning methodologies and to undertake professional research studies. \n\n49. \nExpanding  Access  to  Teacher  Training  Opportunities.  To  increase  participation  of \nstudents, particularly girls, from remote and disadvantaged areas in the teaching profession at \nthe secondary level, 500 scholarships will be provided for teacher trainees at NIE and regional \n\n                                                 \n11  The Government proposes to merge provincial and regional TTCs so the term TTC is being used to cover all levels \n\nof TTCs. \n\n12  The  Government  of  Japan  proposes  to  provide  a  building  for  science  laboratories  in  the  six  regional  TTCs.  ADB \nproject support will complement this with provision of equipment. This excludes the four resource centers provided \nunder the second Education Sector Development Program. \n\n \n\n\f12 \n\n \n\nTTCs.13 Teaching  instructional  materials  in  NIE  and  regional  TTCs  will  be  revised  to  include \nperspectives of gender equality. Facilities of TTCs will be improved to provide a safe and secure \nenvironment for female teachers and teacher trainees.  \n\nImproving  Skills  and  Competencies  of  Teacher  Trainers  in  the  TTCs.  Skills  and \n50. \ncompetencies  of  teacher  trainers  in  the  preservice  teacher  training  program  will  be  improved \nbased  on  a  comprehensive  training  needs  analysis.  The  analysis  will  be  used  to  develop \ntraining programs corresponding to trainer competency criteria described in the teacher training \nstandards and in the teacher standards. Training programs to enhance training skills through (i) \na training-of-trainers course, (ii) multimedia instructional materials, (iii) training for use of ICT in \nthe classroom, and (iv) training in basic English competency, have been included based on the \nskills and competencies identified as priority areas for the professional development of teacher \ntrainers. The research capacity of teacher trainers will be enhanced through an action research \ninitiative linked to an NIE research program and to the inclusion of action research in the revised \nteacher training methodology.  \n\nImproving  Teaching  Skills  and  Competencies  of  Secondary  Teachers.  A  5-year \n51. \nteacher training plan will be developed to coordinate all teacher training activities planned during \nthe  Project.  A  baseline  study  of  teacher  training  needs  linked  to  teacher  competencies  and \nteacher  standards  will  be  undertaken.  The  study  will  provide  information  on  levels  of  teacher \nqualification required to enable prioritization of training to target groups and assist in identifying \nthe  most  disadvantaged  districts  in  terms  of  the  number  of  underqualified  teachers  and  lower \nthan average number of female teachers. It will also provide information to make it possible to \nquantify the competency levels of teachers in order to determine their English language and ICT \ntraining needs. \n\n52. \nUpgrade  Competencies  of  Underqualified  Teachers.  Training  programs  will  be \ndeveloped  and  delivered  to  upgrade  the  competencies  of  an  estimated  14,400  underqualified \nsecondary school teachers using (i) multimedia instructional materials wherever possible, (ii) a \nface-to-face  workshop  module,  and  (iii)  school-based  practical  assignments  such  as  action \nresearch.  The  training  of  school-based  technical  group  leaders  will  be  designed  to  provide \nongoing support for underqualified teachers through a system of mentoring.  \n\n53. \nStrengthening  English  Language,  Science,  and  ICT  Competencies.  A  training \nprogram  will  be  developed  to  enhance  the  English  language  skills  of  upper  secondary  school \nteachers using a decentralized school-based model. The English language course will be based \non a course book, interactive CD, and audio cassette developed in the first year of the project, \nand will be taught by the English-language teacher in the school in classes held for 2 hours per \nweek  over  a  2-year  period.  A  program  similar  to  this  will  also  be  developed  to  train  upper \nsecondary school teachers in teaching science, ICT, and in the use of multimedia instructional \nmaterials. \n\n54. \nDeveloping  Multimedia  Modality  for  Teacher  Education.  Multimedia  modalities  for \nteacher  education  will  be  developed,  initially  through  TTD.  A  comprehensive  plan  will  be \ndeveloped  for  the  expansion  of  facilities  and  the  development  of  technical  capacity  within \nrelevant departments. The plan will define the links and responsibilities which will be necessary \nbetween TTD, PRD, and Information and ASEAN Affairs Department. The multimedia modality \nfor  teacher  education  will  support  the  delivery  of  some  training  activities  through  the  use  of \n                                                 \n13  Females will comprise 60% of the beneficiaries under the total number of scholarships for teacher training and for \nupper secondary level. This percentage is recommended for each category but in case it cannot be met in one or \nother category due to a lack of eligible candidates, it will be compensated for in the second category.    \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n13   \n\n \n\ninteractive computer-based learning materials. The disparity in access to multimedia resources \nacross  the  country  will  be  addressed  through  the  upgrade  of  facilities  and  by  introducing \nmultimedia modalities in teacher training programs.  \n\nThe \n\nteacher \n\ntechnical  capacity  of \n\ntrainers  and  curriculum  developers  will  be \n55. \nstrengthened  for  developing  multimedia  instructional  materials  so  that  they  are  aware  of  the \npotential of multimedia and the ways in which curriculum materials can be prepared. On-the-job \ntraining  will  provide  the  opportunity  for  trainers  to  develop  instructional  materials  for  use  in \nselected  courses.  In  parallel  with  the  development  of  instructional  materials  it  is  necessary  to \ndevelop  and  implement  corresponding  systems  of  academic  and  administrative  support, \nincluding (i) distribution of materials, (ii) completion of assignments, (iii) record keeping, and (iv) \nstudent  support.  The  effectiveness of  multimedia  components  in  teacher  training  programs  for \nimproving  quality  and  contributing  towards  meeting  the  challenge  of  outreach  to  the  more \nremote and disadvantaged areas where access to teacher training opportunities is limited will be \nmonitored.  \n\n3. \n\nStrengthening Secondary Education \n\nThe  objective  of  this  component  is  to  strengthen  secondary  education.  This  will  be \n\n56. \nachieved through the following actions. \n\n57. \nDeveloping a Secondary Education Development Plan. Under the second Education \nSector  Development  Program,  a  secondary  education  development  plan  is  being  prepared \nfocusing on requirements for secondary education based on enrolment projections. The Project \nwill  support  preparation  of  a  complementary  volume  of  the  secondary  education  development \nplan focusing on quality aspects of secondary education development.  \n\n58. \nStrengthening  School  Networking  and  Management.  A  network,  centered  on  36 \nsecondary schools to be developed as resource schools, will be established early in the Project \nto provide support to secondary schools within their catchment areas. The network will be used \nto  strengthen  school  management,  to  introduce  school  improvement  planning,  and  to  help \ndevelop  and  sustain  teacher  competencies  through  professional  development  and  mentoring \nactivities. A school leadership training program for upper secondary school directors will include \na  module  on  school  improvement  planning  linked  to  the  school  self-assessment  model.  It  will \nalso  focus  on  (i)  facility  and  resource  management,  (ii)  performance  monitoring  and \nachievement  of  minimum  quality  standards,  (iii)  school-based  support  for  the  professional \ndevelopment of teachers including mentoring for underqualified teachers, and (iv) school-based \ninduction  programs  for  newly  qualified  teachers.  The  training  will  also  include  optimal  use  of \ntextbooks and other instructional materials, including ICT and multimedia learning resources, on \n(i) gender sensitization and principles of gender mainstreaming, (ii) equitable access to learning \nopportunities for all children, (iii) student retention, (iv) student assessment, and (v) career guidance.  \n\n59. \nThe  skills  and  competencies  of  school  and  network-based  technical  group  leaders  will \nbe  enhanced  through  a  training-of-trainers  program.  The  training  program  will  have  a  school-\nbased focus. Part of the training activities will be undertaken by the participants in their schools \nthrough practical application of new skills and knowledge, using methodologies such as action \nresearch and peer evaluation.   \n\nIncreasing Access for Girls and Children from Remote and Disadvantaged Areas. \n60. \nTo  reduce  gender  disparities  and  inequity  in  access  to  secondary  education  for  children  from \nremote and disadvantaged areas, merit-based scholarships will be provided to 4,000 students, \n\n \n\n\f14 \n\n \n\nparticularly  girls,  from  remote  and  disadvantaged  areas  to  enable  them  to  enroll  in  upper \nsecondary schools.   \n\n61. \nUpgrading Secondary School Facilities including ICT, Laboratories, and Libraries. \nLearning centers will be provided at the 36 resource schools. The learning centers will include \nscience  and  ICT  laboratories,  and  libraries.  To  cover  operations  and  maintenance  costs, \nbusiness plans will be developed to allow the ICT facilities to be used as a community resource. \nAll remaining secondary schools will receive equipment, learning materials, and library books.  \n\n62. \nDeveloping  Curriculum  in  Priority  Areas  for  Use  in  Secondary  Schools. The PRD \nwill be supported to develop the lower secondary and upper secondary curricula in subjects that \nhave thus far not been revised. This includes curricula for EVEP, guidelines for development of \nthe  local  life-skills  program,  and  the  development  of  grade  12  curriculum  standards.  The \npreservice and in-service teacher training curriculum will be strengthened to reflect the changes \nin the school curriculum training content and methods. The Project will support dissemination of \nthe  curriculum  items  to  schools  and  across  the  education  system  in  order  to  ensure  that \nteachers,  teacher  trainers,  and  education  managers  fully  understand  the  requirements  and \nphilosophy of the new curricula. The project will also support development of PRD capacity to \ncommission,  manage,  and  evaluate  textbook  and  instructional  materials  development  by \npublishers and media producers, and strengthen the ICT capacity of PRD. \n\n63. \nProvision of Textbooks and Teacher Guides to All Upper Secondary Schools. The \nnew  curriculum  is  expected  to  be  phased  in  from  the  academic  year  2008\u20132009.  The \ndevelopment  and  procurement  of  new  books  will  take  a  couple  of  years.  In  the  interim,  the \nshortage of textbooks at upper secondary level will be solved by providing the current textbooks \nand teachers\u2019 manuals needed to bring the ratio of books to pupils to 1:2. Current textbooks and \nteacher's manuals will be procured from PDH through a negotiated direct-purchasing agreement \nto enable the books to be in the schools as early as possible in the 2008\u20132009 school year. The \nProject  will  assist  MoEYS,  in  collaboration  with  the  Ministry  of  Economy  and  Finance,  to \ncomprehensively  review  the  current  textbook  development  and  procurement  policies,  and \nprepare  guidelines  for  implementing  the  policies  to  ensure  provision  of  quality  textbooks  in  a \ntimely manner.  \n\n64. \nStrengthening  Assessment  of  Student  Achievement  in  Secondary  Education. \nCurriculum  standards  have  been  developed  at  grades  3,  6,  and  9  and  national  assessments \n(standardized tests) in Khmer and mathematics will be conducted at these grade levels. These \nare  important  steps  towards  a  national  system  of  standards-based  assessment  which  will \nprovide a basis for teachers and students to measure student achievement and for evaluating \neducation quality at national, provincial, and school level. \n\nA  national  assessment  policy  will  be  developed  for  a  standards-based  national \n65. \nassessment  and  examinations  system.  The  policy  will  (i)  establish  a  coherent  relationship \nbetween  different  types  of  assessment,  (ii)  provide  for  quality  assurance  of  assessment  in \nschools, (iii) ensure equity and access, (iv) define the role of ICT, and (v) set out a strategy for \nthe phased strengthening of the Examinations Office, with a view to it eventually becoming an \nindependent body. The strengthening of the Examinations Office will include the enhancement \nof its capacity to use ICT for assessment administration and record keeping. \n\nGuidelines  and  exemplar  assessment  instruments  and  examination  questions  will  be \n66. \ndeveloped and used as a basis for (i) training Examinations Office staff and item writers to set \nand mark standards-based examinations, (ii) secondary teachers to implement standards-based \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n15   \n\n \n\nassessment in schools, and (iii) PRD staff to monitor and evaluate standards-based assessment \nimplementation.  \n\nC. \n\nSpecial Features \n\n67. \nThe Project is the first intervention to provide inputs for comprehensive capacity building \nand  institutional  strengthening  to  enhance  quality  of  education  across  the  school  sector  in \nCambodia.  It  is  also  the  first  intervention  to  support  improvements  in  quality  of  secondary \neducation.  In  addition  to  this,  the  Project  aims  to  integrate  ICT,  capacity  building,  and  broad \ninterventions related to gender mainstreaming into all project activities.   \n \n68. \nCapacity  Building.  The  Project  incorporates  an  appropriate  mix  of  processes  and \nactivities to align capacity building of individuals to organizational outcomes and priorities. Three \nkey  elements  have  been  considered:  (i)  human  capacity  development,  (ii)  institutional \nstrengthening and development of information flows, and (iii) establishing networks. The Project \ntargets  capacity  building  at  the  national,  provincial,  district,  and  school  level  through \ncomprehensive  and  innovative  strategies.  The  resource  schools  and  their  role  in  providing \nongoing  support  and  mentoring  to  teachers  through  refresher  workshops  conducted  by \ndesignated  technical  group  leaders  will  strengthen  quality  while  compensating  for  lack  of \nconventional  in-service  training  due to  resource constraints. The  resource  schools  will  provide \nsupport for improving teacher competencies in science, English, and ICT in secondary schools \nwithin  their  respective  catchment  area.  The  Project  will  strengthen  school  management  and \nplanning  through  leadership  training  for  upper  secondary  school  directors  and  district  and \nprovincial officials.  \n \n69. \nInformation and Communication Technology. The Project supports wide-ranging use \nof  ICT  to  strengthen  quality  and  efficiency  including  (i)  education  MIS  developments,  (ii) \nincorporating ICT in teacher training curriculum, (iii) for teacher trainers, and (iv) for education \nadministrators in using these facilities. The Project pioneers the introduction of ICT in all TTCs \nand  in  the  resource  schools.  ICT  is  introduced  both  as  a  means  to  improve  planning  and \nmanagement  functions  as  well  as  to  enhance  Cambodia\u2019s  competitiveness  by  reducing  the \ntechnology  gap  through  increased  student  exposure  to  ICT  alongside  curriculum  development \nand  teacher  training.  Elements  necessary  for  an  effective  ICT  development  strategy  are \ncohesively  introduced,  e.g.,  training  matches  provision  and  vice  versa,  equipment  provision  is \nplanned  with  infrastructure  developments,  and  training  in  new  pedagogies  relates  to  ICT \nprovision.  The  Project  has  taken  into  account  the  infrastructure  constraints  in  order  to  ensure \nthat the ICT inputs are sustainable.  \n \n70. \nGender  Mainstreaming.  The  Project  will  disseminate  MoEYS\u2019  Gender  Mainstreaming \nPolicy and bring principles of gender equity into all its activities\u2014the training of teacher trainers, \npreservice curriculum for teacher training, as well as management training for school directors \nand district and provincial officials. The Project also provides for facilities in TTCs and schools to \nbe safe and secure for females. A summary poverty reduction and social strategy is in Appendix \n4 and a gender action plan is in Appendix 5. \n \nD. \n\nProject Investment Plan \n\n71. \nThe project investment cost is estimated at $33.38 million equivalent, including physical \nand price contingencies, taxes, and duties (Table 1). The grant proceeds will be used to finance \n(i)  civil  works;  (ii)  procurement  of  books  and  instructional  materials,  vehicles,  equipment,  and \nfurniture;  (iii)  scholarships;  (iv)  consulting  services;  and  (v)  training,  workshops,  and  technical \n\n \n\n\f16 \n\n \n\nmeetings.

MoEYS will be the executing agency (EA) and will have overall \nresponsibility for project implementation. A project steering committee, chaired by a secretary of \nstate,  will  provide  overall  guidance  to  the  Project  and  monitor  its  activities  and  outputs.  Its \nmembership  will  include  representatives  from  the  departments  of  Planning,  Teacher  Training, \nGeneral  Secondary  Education,  and  Pedagogical  Research,  NIE,  and  from  the  ministries  of \nEconomy and Finance, Women's Affairs, and Planning. \n  \nThe director general of General Education will serve as the project director and will be \n74. \nsupported by a deputy project director, five staff,14 and four support staff appointed by MoEYS. \n\n                                                 \n14  The  project  staff  will  have  expertise  in  the  following  fields:  administration,  finance,  accounting,  planning  and \n\nprocurement, and monitoring. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n17   \n\n \n\nThe project staff will be located within the Directorate of General Education. The project director \nwill be a member of the project steering committee and will report to it directly.  \n\n75. \nThree  technical  units  will  be  established  to  guide  and  coordinate  implementation  of \ncomponent-specific activities. The implementation of specific activities will be the responsibility \nof  the  departments  under  whose  authority  the  activities  fall.  The  technical  units  will  have \nrepresentation  from  implementing  departments,  including  a  member  of  the  gender  working \ngroup,  to  ensure  mainstreaming  of  gender  aspects  of  different  activities,  and  two  staff.  The \ntechnical units will report to the project director who will ensure coordination and supervision of \nthe technical units.  \n\n76. \nImplementation  Period.  The  Project  will  be  implemented  over  a  6-year  period.  The \nProject  will  begin  in  2008  and  be  completed  in  2014.  The  government  has  assured  that \nadequate budgetary provision for the Project will be included in the FY2008 budget. A detailed \nimplementation schedule is in Appendix 7. \n\nProcurement. All ADB-financed goods and services will be procured in accordance with \n77. \nADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  The  project  director, \nassisted by the project staff, will be responsible for all procurement. The indicative procurement \npackages are outlined in Appendix 8.  \n\n78. \nSupply contracts for goods estimated at $100,000 equivalent or more will be awarded on \nthe basis of international competitive bidding. Supply contracts for goods such as vehicles and \ncomputers  (except  in  the  case  of  textbooks  and  instructional  materials)  of  less  than  $100,000 \nbut more than $20,000 will follow national competitive bidding procedures. Minor items costing \nless  than  $20,000  but  more  than  $5,000  equivalent  may  be  procured  by  direct  purchase  with \nadvertising,  and  items  costing  less  than  $5,000  may  be  procured  by  direct  purchase  without \nadvertising. Supply contracts for textbooks and instructional materials may be awarded to PDH \non the basis of direct purchase.15 Details of procurement packages and technical specifications \nmust  be  submitted  for  the  Ministry  of  Economy  and  Finance  and  ADB  for  approval  before \nprocurement. \n\nProject  civil  works  will  consist  of  construction  and/or  upgrade  of  learning  facilities, \n79. \ndormitories, and water and sanitation facilities at TTCs and secondary schools. The civil works \ncomponent  will  be  financed  by  ADB  and  the  government  and  will  be  awarded  on  the  basis  of \nnational  competitive  bidding  procedure,  following  Government  procedures  acceptable  to  ADB. \nThe project director, assisted by the project staff and technical unit in charge, will also ensure \nthat  appropriate  maintenance  contractual  arrangements  are  signed  prior  to  the commissioning \nof  civil  works  at  the  expense  of  the  government  in  order  to  ensure  that  the  constructed  civil \nworks are well maintained during their economic life.  \n\n80. \nConsulting  Services.  The  project  will  be  supported  by  approximately  553  person-\nmonths  of  consulting  services  (219  person-months  international  and  334  person-months \nnational).  The  selection  and  engagement  of  consulting  services  will  be  procured  in  a  single \npackage requiring a full technical proposal and using a quality-cost ratio of 80:20 for quality and \ncost-based selection in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as \namended from time to time). The consulting services are designed to provide technical support \nto  the  Project  management  and  implementation,  as  well  as  to  build  longer-term  institutional \n                                                 \n15  To procure existing textbooks and instructional materials that are in copyright, direct purchasing or single or sole \nsourcing will be used due to the fact that such materials are available from only a single proprietary source, namely \nPDH.  \n\n \n\n\f18 \n\n \n\ndevelopment and capacity for planning, management, delivery of professional development for \nteachers, and secondary education. The consulting services cover broad areas of expertise that \ninclude  (i)  institutional  development,  (ii)  MIS  development,  (iii)  professional  development  for \nteachers, (iv) curriculum and materials development (including ICT), (v) examination reform, (vi) \nfacilities  and  equipment  improvement,  and  (vii)  gender  and  equitable  access.  ADB  has \napproved  advance  action  for  recruitment  of  consultants.  The  EA  may  start  the  process  of \nselection  of  consultants.  Advance  action  does  not  include  signing  of  the  contract  with  the \nidentified consultant firm. Outline terms of reference for consultants are provided in Appendix 9.  \n \n81. \nAnticorruption  Policy.  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was \nexplained to and discussed with the Government and the EA. Consistent with its commitment to \ngood  governance,  accountability,  and  transparency,  ADB  reserves  the  right  to  investigate, \ndirectly  or  through  its  agents,  any  alleged  corrupt,  fraudulent,  collusive,  or  coercive  practices \nrelating  to  the  Project.  To  support  these  efforts,  relevant  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption \nPolicy  are  included  in  the  grant  regulations  and  the  bidding  documents  for  the  Project.  In \nparticular,  all  contracts  financed  by  ADB  in  connection  with  the  Project  will  include  provisions \nspecifying  the  right  of  ADB  to  audit  and  examine  the  records  and  accounts  of  the  EA  and  all \ncontractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service providers as they relate to the Project. The \nRecipient  will  ensure  that  information  regarding  procurement,  including  a  list  of  participating \nbidders, name of the winning bidder, and procedures adopted in awarding contracts, is posted \non the MoEYS website. The Recipient will also ensure that criteria and procedure for selection \nof  candidates  for  scholarships  is  also  posted  on  the  MoEYS  website.16 A  Good  Governance \nFramework for Cambodia is provided in Supplementary Appendix E. \n \nDisbursement  Arrangements.  To  expedite  project  implementation  through  the  timely \n82. \nrelease of ADB funds for eligible expenditures, a dollar imprest account will be established by \nthe  Government  at  the  National  Bank  of  Cambodia  or  a  commercial  bank  acceptable  to  ADB. \nThe  initial  advance  to  the  imprest  account  shall  not  exceed  the  lower  of  (i)  estimated \nexpenditure for the first 6 months of Project implementation, or (ii) the equivalent of 10% of the \nGrant amount. The Ministry of Economy and Finance will delegate the authority to operate the \nimprest  account  to  the  EA  in  order  to  facilitate  access  to  project  funds  to  implement  project \nactivities.  The  imprest  account  will  be  established,  managed,  replenished,  and  liquidated  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook17 (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time). \nThe limit on statement of expenditure procedure and the initial advance to the imprest account will also \nbe in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook.  \n\nAccounting,  Auditing,  and  Reporting.  MoEYS  will  maintain  records  and  accounts  to \n83. \nidentify  goods  and  services  financed  from  the  grant  proceeds.  Project  accounts,  including \nfinancial  statements,  statement  of  expenditures,  and  imprest  account  records,  will  be  audited \nannually by independent external auditors acceptable to ADB. The auditors\u2019 report and copies of \nthe certified accounts and related financial statements, including the auditors\u2019 opinion on the use \nof  grant  proceeds,  compliance  with  grant  covenants,  and  use  of  the  imprest  account  under \nADB\u2019s statement of expenditures procedure, will be submitted to ADB in English not later than 6 \nmonths  after  the  close  of  the  Government\u2019s  fiscal  year.  The  independent  external  auditing \nservices will be financed by the Grant. \n\n                                                 \n16  A project-specific website was developed during the project design phase and is linked to the MoEYS website.  \n17  It  should  be  noted  that  this  handbook  is  applicable  to  both  loan  and  grant-funded  ADB  investment  projects  and \n\nprograms. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n19   \n\n \n\nThe EA will prepare quarterly reports on project implementation and submit them to ADB \n84. \nwithin 30 days of the end of each quarter. The reports will be in a format acceptable to ADB and \nwill indicate, among other things, (i) the progress made against established targets, (ii) problems \nencountered  during  the  last  quarter,  (iii)  steps  taken  to  resolve  problems,  (iv)  compliance  with \ngrant covenants, and (v) a proposed program of activities for the succeeding quarter. Within 3 \nmonths after physical completion of the project, the EA will submit to ADB a project completion \nreport on project implementation, accomplishments, benefits, and impact. \n\nProject  Performance  Monitoring  and  Evaluation.  General  baseline  studies  will  be \n85. \nundertaken  at  the  beginning  of  the  Project.  The  monitoring  and  recording  system  and \nprocedures will be reviewed and improved. A new project performance management system will \nbe  developed  and  institutionalized  within  MoEYS  to  monitor  and  evaluate  implementation \nperformance  and  development  impact  at  various  stages  of  the  project  cycle.  Project \nperformance  monitoring  will  focus  on  project  implementation  plans  and  targets,  and  their \nexecution  and  achievement.  Performance  evaluations  will  examine  the  impact  of  project \ninterventions, problems and constraints faced, their causes, and solutions to them.  \n\n86. \nProject  Review.  ADB  and  the  government  will  jointly  undertake  half-yearly  project \nreviews  to  assess  progress  in  each  component,  identify  constraints,  and  determine  ways  to \novercome them. Before each review, the EA will prepare progress reports on a quarterly basis \nand submit these to ADB and the Government. \n\n87. \nADB  and  the  Government  will  conduct  a  midterm  review  during  the  last  quarter  of  the \nthird  year  of  project  implementation  to  inform  planning  for  the  second  half  of  the  project.  The \nmidterm review will (i) review the scope, design, and project implementation arrangements; (ii) \nidentify changes needed; (iii) assess performance against targets and benchmarks; (iv) review \nlessons  and  experiences  in  education  quality  enhancement,  focusing  on  the  curriculum, \ntextbooks, and teaching and learning facilities; (v) review compliance with grant agreements and \ncovenants; and (vi) recommend changes in project design and/or implementation arrangements. \nThe  findings  will  be  discussed  at  a  midterm  workshop  to  be  attended  by  representatives  from \nthe  ministries  of  Economy  and  Finance,  Women's  Affairs,  and  Planning,  concerned  MoEYS \nagencies, provincial and district education officials, the consultants, and ADB. \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n\n88. \nProject Benefits and Impacts. In Cambodia, the quality of educational achievement is \nrelatively  poor,  and  investments  in  improving  education  quality  will  have  significant  positive \nreturns.  Substantial  economic  benefits  will  accrue  from  efficiency  gains  as  a  result  of \nimprovements  in  quality.  Students  who  do  not  drop  out  increase  their  future  earning  potential. \nStudies  indicate  that  each  extra  year  of  schooling  increases  labor  productivity  and  income \nearned.  Similarly,  reduction  in  repetition  rates  increases  the  number  of  wage-earning  years. \nImproved  quality  of  education  will  lead  to  a  greater  number  of  graduates  at  different  levels  of \nschooling. Investments in secondary education will encourage more of the students completing \nprimary  education  to  continue  their  studies,  thus  increasing  their  wage  potential.  Improved \ninternal efficiency will reduce the cost of schooling, thereby freeing up resources for expansion \nof education and for inputs to enhance its quality. The scholarships will provide opportunity for \ngirls  and  students  from  remote  and  disadvantaged  areas  to  continue  their  education  at  the \nupper secondary level. This will have a positive impact on their labor productivity as well as on \nthe income levels of their families.  \n \n\n \n\n\f20 \n\n \n\nto \n\nfrom \n\ntechnical  assistance \n\nGreater  equity  in  education  reduces  socioeconomic  disparities  and  leads  to  better \n89. \nintegrated  and  more  harmonious  societies.  Long-term  benefits  include  (i)  human  development \nand  productivity  efficiency  through  a  better  qualified  teaching  and  managerial  staff  and \nincreased  numbers  of  higher  quality  secondary  students;  (ii)  social  benefits  derived  from  girls' \neducation such as (a) lower fertility, (b) increased prenatal care utilization, (c) improved health \nand nutrition status of families, and (d) higher educational attainment by their children; and (iii) \ngreater  wealth  redistribution  gains  as  a  result  of  support  to  students  from  remote  and \ndisadvantaged areas.  \n \n90. \nThe  education  system  will  benefit  from  (i)  strengthened  institutional  capacity  for \nplanning,  management,  design,  and  delivery  of  education  services;  (ii)  improved  facilities  in \nTTCs  and  schools;  (iii)  improved  and  upgraded  curriculum  for  preservice  teacher  training  and \nsecondary education; (iv) enhanced competencies of teacher trainers and teachers; (v) school \nnetworks  for  outreach  to  strengthen  school  management  and  teacher  competencies;  and  (vi) \nincreased availability of teaching and/or learning materials in TTCs and secondary schools.  \n \nDirect benefits from the Project will accrue to (i) academic staff and management of NIE \n91. \nand  the  24  TTCs  through  improved  facilities  and  teaching  and/or  learning  resources,  and \ntraining for enhancing their competencies; (ii) approximately 8,500 teacher trainees over 5 years \nthrough  activities  designed \nimprove  preservice  courses;  (iii)  approximately  14,400 \nunderqualified secondary teachers benefiting from in-service training; (iv) 300 upper secondary \nschools  benefiting \nin  school  management,  networking  and \nimprovement planning; (v) staff of MoEYS, including provincial and district office teams, trained \nto strengthen their capacity to plan, manage, administer, and regulate the system; and (vi) 600 \ntrainee teachers from accommodation in new and rehabilitated dormitories. At the school level \ndirect benefits will accrue to (i) all secondary schools; (ii) 4,000 disadvantaged students through \nscholarships;  (iii)  350,000  students  from  textbooks  and  improved  facilities  and  learning \nmaterials; and (iv) approximately 7,000 students through the provision of teachers\u2019 guides and \nimproved teaching and/or learning facilities. Benefits of the reforms and quality improvements in \nteacher training will also extend to a population of school students that is currently around 3.4 \nmillion. \n \nEnvironment  and  Social  Safeguards.  The  Project  involves  upgrading  of  facilities  at \n92. \nexisting TTCs and schools where all work, including construction of new facilities, will be carried \nout  on  existing  property  owned  by  the  schools,  TTCs,  and  NIE.  School  upgrading  will  require \nsmall-scale  civil  works,  and  no  negative  environmental  impact  is  expected.  As  the  Project  will \nnot require land acquisition and targets children who are already in the school system, there will \nbe no negative impact on community life or socioeconomic or cultural integrity. \n \n93. \nRisks. The Project has been designed with extensive stakeholder participation. There is \nownership  and  commitment  at  all  levels  of  government,  and  within  its  allied  agencies  and \ninstitutions, to the proposals contained in the Project.  \n \n94. \nThe  main  risk  emanates  from  weak  management  and  institutional  capacity.  This  could \nhamper  timely  implementation  of  project  activities,  since  the  expansion  of  activities  will  place \nadditional demands on all Government agencies involved in project implementation. The Project \nmitigates this risk by providing extensive and carefully targeted technical support to strengthen \ncapacity  of  the  concerned  agencies,  and  enhance  staff  skills  and  institutional  capacity  for \ncontinuing qualitative support to education. The project also provides for a realistic time-frame \nwith implementation over a 6-year period. \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n21   \n\n \n\nSustainability.  The Project will generate continuing additional incremental cost of over \n95. \n$1  million  annually  after  the  project period  through  the  operation  and  maintenance of  facilities \nand  equipment.  These  costs  will  be  a  continuation  of  recurrent  costs  the  government  will \nsupport  during  project  implementation,  and  can  be  reduced  with  proper  and  efficient  use  of \nfacilities and equipment. The Project supports training for personnel in the use of equipment and \nmanagement  of  facilities.  Efficiency  gains  are  also  expected  to  offset  the  additional  resource \nrequirements.  Some  project  gains \nteacher \ncompetencies,  and  (iii)  improve  the  curriculum,  classroom  assessment  and  examination,  and \nthe  provision  of  textbooks  and  other  materials  to  enhance  learning,  will  have  long-term \nbeneficial impact and are not susceptible to short-term resource constraints. An economic and \nfinancial analysis is in Appendix 10. \n\nthat  (i)  strengthen  capacity,  (ii)  upgrade \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n\nIn addition to the standard assurances, the Government has given the following specific \n\nA. \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\n96. \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n97. \n \n\nThe Government will:  \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nEnsure  through  MoEYs  that  no  rehabilitation  or  construction  of  facilities  for  the \nschools, TTCs, and NIE will involve involuntary resettlement according to ADB\u2019s \nInvoluntary  Resettlement  Policy  (1995).  Construction  of  new  facilities  will  be \ncarried  out  within  existing  campuses  on  unoccupied  land  already  owned  by  the \nschools, TTCs, and NIE. Proposals for civil works must include confirmation that \nno land acquisition or resettlement will be required under the Project.  \n\nProvide  counterpart  funds  for  project  implementation  on  time.  The  Government \nwill also make timely submission of annual budgetary appropriation requests and \nensure prompt disbursement of appropriate funds during project implementation. \n\nEnsure  that  the  gender  and  development  plan  prepared  for  the  Project  is  fully \nimplemented  and  monitored  in  a  timely  manner  in  accordance  with  its  terms, \nrelated  regulations  of  the  Recipient  and  ADB's  policies  on  gender  and \ndevelopment18 and adequate resources are allocated for this purpose.  \n\nEnsure  that  the  site  selection,  design,  construction,  replacement  work,  and \noperation  of  facilities  in  schools,  TTCs  and  NIE  is  implemented  in  accordance \nwith  the  relevant  Government  regulations  and  standards  as  well  as  ADB\u2019s \nenvironment policy. \n\nThe  Recipient  shall,  within  1  year  after  the  Effective  Date,  review  the  current \ntextbook  policies  and  practices  with  a  view  to  identifying  and  eliminating  any \nrestrictive  practices  regarding  copyrights  and  printing  and  publishing  processes \nto ensure production and provision of quality textbooks in a timely manner. \n\n  \nConditions for Grant Effectiveness \n\nB. \n\nConditions for grant effectiveness include:  \n\n98. \n \n                                                 \n18  ADB. 2003.

MoEYS  has \nhigh-level established positions of minister, secretary of state, and under secretary of state \noverseeing  six  structures  at  the  directorate  level  (administration  and  finance,  education, \nhigher  education,  youth  and  sport,  and  the  inspectorate  general  plus  an  Education  for  All \nsecretariat). Below these directorates, inspectorate, and secretariat structures are a number \nof  supporting  technical  departments.  MoEYS  also  has  education  offices  at  provincial  and \ndistrict level, and school management related to communities and communes. In November \n2004,  responsibility  for  technical  and  vocational  education  was  transferred  to  the  newly \nestablished Ministry of Labor and Vocational Training. \n\nTo  deliver  education  services  the  system  has  a  number  of  levels,  starting  with \n2. \npreschool for children aged 3\u20135. Basic education covers a 9-year period, with primary school \ncovering  grades  1\u20136  and  lower  secondary  covering  grades  7\u20139.  Upper  secondary  level \n(grade  10)  begins  with  a  national  examination  at  the  end  of  grade  9  and  finishes  with  a \nnational  examination  at  the  end  of  grade  12.  Technical  and  vocational  education  training \nprograms run parallel to the upper secondary programs at grades 10, 11, and 12, but are not \nthe responsibility of MoEYS. Higher-education programs are run at various universities and \ninstitutes.  \n\nIn the 2006\u20132007 school year there were 9,018 schools with 80,733 classes. There \n3. \nwere  3,387,310  students,  of  whom  1,574,900  were  girls.  The  number  of  teachers  was \n77,794  teachers,  32,068  of  whom  were  women.  The  schools  served  the  2,530,000 \nhouseholds that make up 13,406 villages, 185 districts, and 24 provinces (including the four \nmunicipalities).1  \n\n4. \nIn  the  Education  Statistics  and  Indicators  2006\u20132007  (MoEYS  2006)  secondary \nschools  (colleges  and  lyc\u00e9es)  and  school  levels  (lower  and  upper  secondary)  are  defined. \nThe  846  colleges  are  lower  secondary  schools  with  grades  7\u20139.  However,  some  lower \nsecondary  schools  may  not  have  all  three  grades.  The  283  lyc\u00e9es  are  upper  secondary \nschools with grades 10\u201312 but some also have lower secondary grades. Statistics relating to \nthe lower secondary level are collected from all schools with grades 7\u20139 (1,112 schools) and \nstatistics relating to the upper secondary level are collected from all schools with grades 10\u2013\n12 (283 schools2). In 2006\u20132007 at the upper secondary level there were 222,271 students \n(88,701  of  them  girls)  studying  in  4,303  classes  being  taught  by  6,688  teachers  (1,956 \nfemales). At the lower secondary level there were 626,005 students (285,699 girls) in 12,633 \nclasses being taught by 20,485 teachers (6,890 females).3  \n\n5. \nIn 2006\u20132007 at the national level the gross enrolment ratio (GER) at primary level \nwas 122.7% at lower secondary 60.0% and at upper secondary 21.2% The figures for girls \nwere  119.3%,  54.5%  and  17.2  %  respectively.  The  net  enrolment  ratio  (NER)  at  primary \nlevel  was  92.1%  at  lower  secondary  33.7%  and  at  upper  secondary  12.5%  with  girls\u2019  net \nenrolment being 91%, 33.1% and 11.3% respectively. Transition rates from primary to lower \nsecondary  were  78.7%  and \nto  upper  secondary  66.2%.  \nCorresponding  rates for  girls  were  77.1%  and  65.8%.    Pupil-teacher  ratios  were 51.3% for \nprimary,  30.6%  for  lower  secondary,  and  33.2  %  for  upper  secondary.  As  the  statistics \nindicate, enrolments at the primary level have grown rapidly, expanding 13% between 1997\u2013\n1998  and  2006\u20132007.  The  rates  of  expansion  at  the  lower  secondary  (135%)  and  upper \n                                                 \n1   MoEYS. 2006. 2002-06 Education Indicators.

For planning purposes the DGE figure will be \nused.  \n\nlower  secondary \n\nfrom \n\n3   MoEYS. 2006. Education Statistics, 2005\u20132006.

However, \noverall  enrolments  at  the  upper  and  lower  secondary  level  remain  low.  This  is  largely  a \nconsequence of poor geographic access to lower secondary schools, which act as a bridge \nbetween primary and upper secondary schooling. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) and \nthe  World  Bank  are  both  supporting  construction  of  lower  secondary  schools.  Through  the \nsecond  Education  Sector  Development  Program 4 ADB  is  supporting  construction  of  400 \nlower secondary schools. The World Bank is supporting construction of 280 lower secondary \nschools through the CESSP.5 The impact of this on enrolments at the lower secondary level \nwill be felt in the coming years. The second Education Sector Development Program is also \nproviding  for  49  new  secondary  schools  to  cater  to  the  growing  demand  for  secondary \nschooling.  \n\n6. \nUnder the education strategy set out within the Government\u2019s Rectangular Strategy \nfor  Growth,  Employment,  Equity  and  Efficiency,  the  Government  will  continue  to  increase \nbudget expenditures and mobilize increased international assistance to (i) enable incentives \nfor  teachers;  (ii)  assure  quality  instruction;  (iii)  increase  provision  of  educational  materials, \nequipment,  libraries,  and  laboratories;  (iv)  build  dormitories  for  students,  especially  female \nstudents; (v) continue to reform curricula and training programs; (vi) provide scholarships to \npoor  students;  (vii)  promote  literacy  and  informal  education  programs;  (viii)  finance \nconstruction of schools in rural areas; and (ix) support school operating costs. The highest \npriority is given to implementation of the national Education for All (EFA) plan and associated \nteacher development programs.  \n\n7. \nThe  Education  Strategic  Plan  (ESP)  planning  process  has,  through  more  than  one \ncycle,  taken  the  policy  and  strategy  dimensions  described  above  and  defined  actions  and \ntargets. The aim of the Education Sector Support Program (ESSP) 2006\u201320106 is to outline \nhow the policies and strategies laid out in the ESP 2006\u20132010 will be put into practice. The \nbasic  principle  adopted  in  the  ESSP  is  that  programs  will  be  planned  and  implemented \nthrough  the  Government  and  MoEYS  systems  rather  than  through  parallel  modalities.  The \nmanagement  framework  for  ESSP  places  the  focus  on  strengthening  appropriate  MoEYS \ndirectorates  and  departments  at  central  and  provincial  levels,  including  delegation  of \nresponsibilities  to  districts,  clusters  and/or  communes,  and schools.  The  National  Strategic \nDevelopment Plan endorses the ESSP 2006\u20132010. It is anticipated that the draft Education \nLaw when passed will set a framework for the implementation and consolidation of a number \nof these policies. \n\n8. \nThe  ESSP  2006\u20132010  policy  action  matrix  divides  the  policy  actions  into  three \ncategories:  equitable  access,  quality  and  efficiency,  and  institution  and  capacity  building. \nEquitable  access  policy  actions  will  (i)  expand  access  to  Early  Childhood  Education,  (ii) \nensure  entry  of  all  6-year-olds  into  primary  school,  (iii)  reduce  parental  cost  barriers,  (iv) \nreduce repetition and drop out levels in all grades, (v) enable greater community involvement \nin all stages of schooling, (vi) continue provision of new schools or additional facilities; (vii) \nincrease  enrolment  in  grades  7\u20139,  (viii)  increase  enrolments  in  grades  10\u201312,  (ix)  ensure \nteacher  provision  in  remote  and  disadvantaged  areas;  (x)  improve  the  efficiency  of  staff \ndeployment,  (xi)  ensure  widely  expanded  provision  of  quality  upper  secondary  education, \n(xii)  increase  the  number  of  scholarships  for  students  from  poor  families;  (xiii)  expand  the \nprovision of  quality  higher  education,  and  (xiv)  expand  public,  nongovernment  organization \n(NGO), and/or community partnerships in Non-formal Education in border and remote areas. \nTwo major interventions funded by the World Bank and ADB are rapidly changing the scale \nof  access  to  secondary  education  in  support  of  the  ESP  2006\u20132010.

Boys and girls start schooling on an equal \nfooting in primary education but the drop out rate among girl students starts to go up as they \nprogress  through  the  grades,  particularly  after  completion  of  primary  education.  Poverty  is \nthe  overriding  reason  for  gender  disparities  in  terms  of  enrolment  and  literacy.  Among \nfemale  students  drop  out  rates  reduce  with  each  successive  grade  completed.  The  net \nenrolment  rate  of  children  in  secondary  education  in  ethnic  minority  and  disadvantaged \nareas  is  much  lower  than  the  national  average.  Along  with  poverty,  the  distant  location  of \nschools,  language  barriers,  disproportionate  teacher-student  ratios,  and  inappropriate \ninstructional  materials,  are  the  major  factors  that  keep  children  of  ethnic  minority  groups \naway from school. These factors affect girls of ethnic minorities more than boys. Potentially \nsome  of  these  issues  can  be  addressed  through  enhancing  enrolment  of  teacher  trainees \nfrom ethnic minority and disadvantaged areas at NIE and regional TTCs.  \n\n12. \nOverall, general progress has been made in the education sector in recent years and \nconsiderable progress has been made in the last 5 years on implementing education sector \nplanning  and  reforms.  This  includes  (i)  reductions  in  cost  barriers,  (ii)  effective  enrolment \ncampaigns,  (iii)  the  introduction  of  school  operating  budgets  and  remedial  classes,  (iv) \nsubstantial  increases  in  the  Government\u2019s  recurrent  spending  on  education,  and  (v)  the \ngrowth  of  policy-led  support.  Attention  is  now  shifting  to  strengthening  the  quality  and \nefficiency of the education sector.   \n\n13. \nEducation quality is determined by a set of multifaceted and interrelated subsectors. \nThese include (i) efficiency of decision making, (ii) provision and deployment of teachers, (iii) \nteacher  training  and  retraining,  (iv)  remuneration  systems,  (v)  curriculum  development  and \ntextbook provision, (vi) valid and reliable assessment of the achievement of students and the \nperformance  of  schools,  (vii)  provision  of  good  and  well-supported  computer  systems  to \nenhance  learning  and  teaching  programs  and  infrastructure  (such  as  school  buildings  and \nclassrooms, furniture, and teaching aids), and (viii) an efficient and effective mechanism for \ncollecting  data.  To  improve  quality,  five  components  are  needed:  (i)  building  enough \nclassrooms,  (ii)  providing  enough  qualified  teachers  in  all  subjects,  (iii)  providing  enough \nmaterials for teaching and learning, (iv) improving the quality of living for teachers, especially \nin more remote locations, and (v) providing opportunities for professional development. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f32 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n14. \nTo  improve  both  decision  making  and  implementation,  there  is  a  need  to  review \nMoEYS\u2019  organization  and  functions  to  clarify  departmental  and  office  roles,  reduce \noverlapping functions, and to further respond to decentralization and deconcentration policy. \n\n15. \nPrimary  school  teacher  demand  projections  indicate  that  the  total  number  of \nadditional  teachers  needed  for  the  period  from  now  until  2015  will  be  30,384.  Lower \nsecondary  school  teacher  demand  projections  indicate  a  total  shortfall  of  41,507  teachers \nfrom 2007 to 2015. Upper secondary school teacher demand projections indicate that there \nis  a  total  additional  demand  during  the  2007\u20132015  period  for  36,090  upper  secondary \nteachers.  It  is  difficult  to  predict  teacher  demand  for  the  new  elective  subject  system  for \ngrades 11 and 12 due to the uncertainty of school and student choice. \n\n16. \nTeacher  education  is  provided  through  national,  regional,  and  provincial  providers. \nNIE  runs  programs  training  university  graduates  to  become  upper  secondary  teachers. \nLower secondary teachers are trained at regional TTCs and primary teachers are taught at \nprovincial TTCs. The Pre-school Teacher Training College in Phnom Penh trains preschool \nteachers. NIE also trains educational administrators. During the academic year 2005\u20132006,7 \n7,261 teachers were in training, of whom 3,034 were women.8  \n\n17. \nTo improve quality at the upper secondary school level, including at those in remote \nareas,  additional  teachers  need  to  be  deployed  so  that  more  subjects  can  be  taught \ncompetently.  The  current  situation  results  in  schools  opening  but  students  not  attending \nbecause  they  do  not  wish  to  study  under  conditions  where  teacher  competencies  do  not \nmeet  curriculum  requirements.  There  is  also  a  need  to  ensure  a  future  supply  of  upper \nsecondary  teachers.  Estimates  suggest  that  the  current  capacity  of  NIE  will  be  inadequate \nfor future supply in the medium term.  \n\n18. \nThe  six  regional  TTCs  provide  2-year  programs  to  train  lower  secondary  teachers. \nThere is an identified need to improve the living environment (dormitories, cooking facilities \nand toilets) in addition to expanding facilities that relate to science, ICT, and multimedia. The \nprovincial  TTCs  located  throughout  the  country  provide  2-year  programs  to  train  primary \nteachers.  The  role  of  provincial  TTCs  is  changing  as  they  become  responsible  for  training \nbasic education teachers and with the merging of some of the regional and provincial TTCs.  \n\nThe ESSP prioritizes a TTC staff development program and a responsive preservice \n19. \nand  in-service  teacher  training  program  to  enhance  the  capacity  of  secondary  school \nteachers  and  trainers.  These  programs  are  linked  to  the  planned  introduction  of  teacher \nstandards, teacher training standards, and improved systems of performance monitoring. A \nsystem of formal certification is proposed in the ESSP as a foundation for the development \nof  the  national teacher  education  system. To  achieve  this,  the  TTD  at  MoEYS  will  need  to \nestablish  criteria  and  procedures  for  assessment  of  competencies  and  certification  of \ncourses  that  teachers  and  trainers  attend.  The  information  will  be  required  by  the  MoEYS \nDepartment  of  Personnel  in  relation  to  management  of  the  performance  monitoring  and \neducation management information system (MIS). \n\n20. \nA  secondary  education  development  plan  being  prepared  by  the  Department  of \nGeneral Secondary Education identifies a number of improvement areas, underpinned by a \nnumber of strategies to enhance the quality of secondary education. This plan has a focus \non providing a context for the construction of secondary schools under the second Education \nSector  Development  Program.  There  is  an  awareness  that  a  comprehensive  plan  would \ncover  five  broad  areas:  (i)  enhancing  the  skills  of  the  secondary  education  workforce;  (ii) \n                                                 \n7   Data from TTD, MoEYS approved on 9 March 2007, indicates total enrolment for 2006\u20132007 is 8,880 (4,019 \n\n8   Data from Teacher Training Department (TTD), MoEYS approved on 9 March 2007, TA 4823-CAM document \nD12,  consolidated  reports  of  technical  assistance team (ADB.  2006.  Technical Assistance to the Kingdom of \nCambodia for Preparing the Education Quality Improvement Project. Manila.). \n\nwomen). \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 2 \n\n33 \n\nstrengthening the secondary school support structures with MoEYS; (iii) ongoing secondary \nschool  improvement;  (iv)  supporting  secondary  teaching  and  learning;  and  (v)  enhancing \nfacilities,  resources,  and  funding  for  secondary  education.  Currently  there  is  inadequate \nresourcing for a comprehensive secondary education development plan.   \n\nA  process  of  developing  and  introducing  new  curricula  is  underway  throughout  the \n21. \nschool system. To this end, MoEYS has an approved policy and master plan for curriculum \ndevelopment for the period 2005\u20132009. PRD is responsible for curriculum development and \nhas received support from the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) \nat the basic education level and from the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) in \nmathematics  and  three  science  subjects  at  upper  secondary  level.  To  date,  new  curricula \nhave  been  developed  for  lower  secondary  Khmer,  mathematics,  social  studies,  and  the \nsciences,  and  for  upper  secondary  mathematics,  biology,  chemistry,  and  physics.  PRD \nwould  benefit  from  technical  assistance  to  support  the  conceptualization,  design,  and \ndevelopment  of  the  outstanding  new  curricula,  and  in  particular  in  areas  which  are  less \nfamiliar  than  the  traditional  school  subjects.  As  well  as  drawing  on  consultancy  support  in \nthese areas, PRD may consider a strategy of acquiring existing curricula and courses. Such \ncourses might be adopted or adapted to a Cambodian context from materials that are in use \nelsewhere in the region. This may particularly be the case for foreign languages (English and \nFrench) and some of the proposed Elective Vocational Education Program (EVEP) subjects \nsuch  as  tourism  and  ICT.  Future  systems  should  require  PRD  to  proceed  with  developing \ncurricula  with  less  direct  intervention.  It  should  build  on  the  experience  gained  from  the \nUSAID-funded Basic Education Project but technical assistance should focus on provisions \nto  build  the  capacity  of  PRD  curriculum  writers  to  enhance  their  roles  in  curriculum  writing \nand  the  management  of  the  process  of  developing  textbooks,  teachers\u2019  guides,  and  other \ninstructional  materials.  MoEYS\u2019  stated  policy  is  to  ensure  the  adequate  provision  of  core \ninstructional materials on a national basis and to encourage the process of widening choice \n(and therefore quality) in the provision of textbooks by opening the textbook market to supply \nby multiple publishers. This will allow decentralization and more flexibility in the purchase of \ncore  learning  materials  at  the  school  level,  with  a  consequent  gain  in  quality  and  cost \nbenefits  for  MoEYS.  However,  MoEYS\u2019  policy  has  been  difficult  to  implement  due  to  a \ncomplex  set  of  factors.  The  result  has  been  that,  so  far,  textbook  production  remains  the \nmonopoly of PHD. Centralized procurement also results in delays in textbook procurement.  \n\nReforms  in  assessment  and  examinations  are  needed  to  support  the  national \n22. \ncurriculum  reform  and  to  ensure  valid  and  reliable  measurement  of  student  achievement, \nwhich  will  in  turn  contribute  significantly  to  quality  assurance  in  education.  The  national \npolicy  on  assessment  should  also  address  quality  assurance  of  internal  assessment  (e.g., \nthrough  external  moderation  of  school  assessments  by  the  PRD  Research  and  Evaluation \nOffice)  and  ensure  equitable  access  to  assessment  for  students  with  disabilities.  The \nDirectorate  of  General  Education  Examinations  Office  currently  lacks  capacity.  A  phased \nstrengthening  of  its  capacity  is  needed  both  through  training  and  introduction  of  ICT-led \nimprovements  to  the  management  of  assessment,  administration,  and  record  keeping. \nComputer-generated  examinations  and  computer-based  marking  can  improve  validity  and \nreliability, improve examination security, and reduce costs in the long term. Teachers need \nto  be  trained  and  supported  in  the  development  of  assessment  tools  and  question  papers \nthat  assess  students  against  curriculum  standards  in  grades  3,  6,  and  9  in  a  valid  and \nreliable  way.  The  School  Based  Assessment  in  other  grades  needs  to  be  related  to  the \nassessment  against  curriculum  standards  in  grades  3,  6,  and  9  to  ensure  continuity  and \nprogression  in  the  assessment  of  students  and  reporting  to  parents  and  students.  The \ntraining of teachers will be greatly facilitated by the development and distribution of exemplar \nassessment tasks and question papers. The process would also benefit from an approach in \nwhich teachers were able to get access to expert support at a local level. Capacity needs to \nbe developed at regional and school level to implement a systematic program of training and \nsupport. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f34 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n23.  MISs  in  MoEYS  remain  weak.  Mechanisms  for  data  gathering,  retention,  and \nmanipulation  are  minimal  at  the  point  of  collection.  MISs  often  do  not  have  the  capacity  to \ninterconnect  with  another,  not  only  because  the  basic  data  sets  are  incompatible  but  also \nbecause  the  staff  lack  the  analytical  skills.  This  is  the  case  with  current  MISs.  Where  they \nexist,  basic  data  sets  are  held  within  systems  which  are  associated  with  a  specific  entity. \nCurrently  MoEYS  has  a  number  of  information  systems:  an  education MIS  centered  in  the \nMoEYS Department of Planning, a finance MIS in the Department of Finance, and a human \nresources  MIS  in  the  Department  of  Personnel.  The  education  MIS  system  does  not \ninterrelate with the human resources or finance MIS. The human resources MIS is supported \nby  the  United  Nations  Children's  Fund  (UNICEF)  and  the  European  Union,  and  the \neducation  MIS  is  supported  by  UNICEF  and  the  Swedish  International  Development \nCooperation Agency (Sida). Other systems exist or are planned, and these relate to school \nconstruction, nonformal education, higher education, and the Department of Information and \nASEAN Affairs. \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix  3 \n\n \n35\n\nEXTERNAL ASSISTANCE TO THE EDUCATION SECTOR \n \n\nProjected Trends in External Assistance \n\nA. \n \n1. \nTotal external funding to the education sector for the period 2005\u20132010 is estimated \nat  $327.6  million,  with  $97.2  million  actually  spent  in  2005,  $100.1  million  in  2006,  and \n$130.3  million  projected  for  2007\u20132010.  The  total  funding  is  financed  by  124  donor \norganizations  through  324  outstanding  projects.  Of  the  total  projected  financing  for  the \n2005\u20132010 period, 29% is expected to come from United Nations (UN) agencies, 26% from \ninternational  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs),  15%  from  bilateral  agencies,  8%  from \ninternational organizations, 4% from local NGOs, 2% from research institutes, and 17% from \nother  sources.  Although  the  funding  amount  is  aggregated,  the  Asian  Development  Bank \n(ADB),  the  World  Bank,  the  European  Commission,  and  the  UN  agencies  are  among  the \nbiggest  donors  to  the  country's  education  sector.  Summary  figures  are  provided  in  Figure \nA3. \n \n\nFigure A3: Development Partner Budget by Type of Donor \nOrganization: 2005\u20132010 \n($ \u2019000)\n\nLocal NGOs, \n$14,296  4%\n\nResearch \nInstitutes, \n$7,965  2%\n\nUN \nOrganization, \n$91,588  29% \n\nInternational \nOrganizations,\n$26,447  8%\n\nBilateral Donors,\n$46,181  14%\n\nOthers, $55,166\n17%\n\nInternational \nNGOs, $85,927 \n26%\n\nNGO = nongovernment organization, UN = United Nations. \nSource:  Ministry  of  Education,  Youth  and  Sport\u2019s  Department  of  Planning.  2006.

In  terms  of  annual  budget  allocation  and  disbursement,  29.7%  of  the  total  budget \nwas  actually  disbursed  in  2005,  an  estimated  30.5%  was  disbursed  in  2006,  and  it  is \nprojected  that  the  remainder  will  be  disbursed  in  the  following  proportions:  18.7%  in \n2007, 10.9% in 2008, 6.4% in 2009, and 3.8% in 2010. This projection has not taken into \naccount  further  annual  commitments  (and  disbursements)  by  the  donor  community  to \nCambodia at annual Donor Consultative Group meetings.  \n\n \n3. \nWith  regard  to  budget  by  subsector,  the  total  2005\u20132010  budget  is  allocated  as \nfollows:  34.2%  for  primary  education  quality  and  efficiency;  9.9%  for  nonformal  education \nexpansion;  8.3%  for  facility  expansion;  6.8%  for  continuous  teacher  education;  6.6%  for \ncapacity building; 6.5% for higher education quality, efficiency, and equitable access; 3.7% \nfor  lower  secondary  education  access,  quality,  and  efficiency;  3.4%  for  secondary \n\n \n\n\f36 \n\n \n\nAppendix 3 \n\nscholarships for the poor; 3.3% for upper secondary education access and equitable access; \n2.9%  for  early  childhood  education;  1.9%  for  core  instructional  materials;  0.6%  for \nstrengthened monitoring systems; 0.6% for education service efficiency; 0.2% for youth and \nsport  development,  and  the  remaining  10%  is  allocated  to  other  subsectors.  Details  are \npresented in Table A3.1.  \n \n4. \nIt  is  noted  that  allocated  investment  in  (lower  and  upper)  secondary  education \naccess,  quality,  and  efficiency  accounts  for  just  7.1%  of  the  total  budget  compared  with \n34.2%  for  primary  education  quality  and  efficiency.  In  this  regard,  more  funding  should  be \nallocated  to  improvement  of  the  quality  of  secondary  education  due  to  its  significant  social \nreturns from this subsector. To this end, ADB's focus in the Project is well justified. \n \n5. \nBy  geography,  the  donor  budget  distribution  for  2005\u20132010  is  balanced,  taking into \naccount population, poverty severity, and other economic and demographic indicators. The \ndistribution is also observed to be balanced between nondisadvantaged and disadvantaged \nprovinces.  It  is  indicated  that  the  budget  for  Phnom  Penh  accounts  for  18%  of  the  total \n2005\u20132010  budget.  However,  this  high  proportion  is  due  to  the  fact  that  allocations  to  line \nministries  are  aggregated  in  this  category,  rather  than  Phnom  Penh  being  counted  as  a \nnormal administrative unit.  \n \nB. \n \n6. \nThe  Ministry  of  Education,  Youth  and  Sport  (MoEYS)  has  endorsed  the  national \nEducation  Strategic  Plan  (ESP)  2006\u20132010.  The  required  funding  to  successfully  achieve \nthe ESP objectives is estimated at $864 million for the 2006\u20132010 period.

The total net enrolment ratio (NER) in 2006\u20132007 is estimated at 33.7% (33.1% for females) at lower \nsecondary  level  and  12.5%  (11.3%  for  females)  at  upper  secondary  level.  Quality  education  can  improve  the  skills \nefficiency  and  productivity  of  human  resources,  and  help  achieve  sustainable  growth  within  a  globally  competitive \nenvironment.  Secondary  education  widens  opportunities  through  enhanced  employability.  About  54%  of  the  total \npopulation is economically active and 7% is unemployed. According to the Socio-economic Survey (2004),1 only 4% of \nthe  labor  force  in  2004  had  received  upper  secondary  or  postsecondary  education.  The  Rectangular  Strategy  for \nGrowth,  Employment,  Equity  and  Efficiency  sets  out  the  Government\u2019s  education  strategy.  In  particular,  it  targets \nenhancing  human  resources  with  high  technical  and  scientific  skills  that  effectively  respond  to  the  labor  market.  The \nNational Strategic Development Plan 2006\u20132010 targets education as one of the important factors in poverty reduction. \nThe plan endorses the ESP, and emphasizes development of the teaching workforce. Investment to improve teaching \nquality and enrolment of girls in upper secondary education is necessary to support Government efforts in achieving the \nCambodia  Millennium  Development  Goal  3,  Target  1,  of  improving  the  ratio  of  girls  to  boys  in  upper  secondary \neducation from 48% in 2001 to 100% in 2015. \nB.  Poverty Analysis  \nCambodia  had  an  estimated  14  million  people  in  2006,  with  a  population  growth  rate  of  1.8%  per  annum  and  a  per \ncapita income of $385. About 36% of the population lives below the national poverty line and one in five Cambodians \nlives  under  the  food  poverty  line.2 According  to  the  Socio-economic  Survey  (2004),  91%  of  poor  people  live  in  rural \nareas. In Tonle Sap 45% people live in severe poverty. The corresponding figure in the mountain and plateau regions \nis 56%. Poor households have a higher dependency burden and lack human capital. They tend to (i) be uneducated, \nunskilled,  and  unhealthy;  (ii)  have  limited  access  to  rural  infrastructure  and  markets;  and  (iii)  be  more  vulnerable  to \nland rights and housing tenure issues.  \n \nPoor  students  are  more  visible  at  the  primary  level  (20%)  than  the  upper  secondary  (2%)  or  tertiary  (0%)  level.  In \ncomparison, nearly 61% of upper secondary students and 57% of tertiary students come from the richest 20% of the \npopulation.  The  following  factors  hinder  basic  education  attainment  levels  in  disadvantaged  areas:  (i)  high  levels  of \npoverty,  (ii)  distant  location  of  the  school,  (iii)  lack  of  teachers  particularly  from  ethnic  minority  groups,  (iv)  lack  of \neducational materials, (v) lack of toilets, (vi) lack of security measures, and (vii) poor quality education. Girls are more \nhindered by these factors, as a higher proportion of girls than boys between the ages of 15 and 19 are part of the labor \nforce.  A  recent  survey  found  that  out  of  about  1.6  million  school-aged  children  not  attending  school  full  time,  about \n25%  indicated  household  income  and/or  work  responsibilities  as  the  main  reason  for  nonattendance,  while  only  8% \nstated a lack of accessible education provision.   \n \nThe education system relies heavily on households\u2019 private contributions for both direct and indirect education costs. \nOn average, unofficial monthly school fees per student, excluding incidentals such as uniforms, are KR3,500 ($0.9) at \nthe  primary  level,  KR8,000  ($2)  at  the  lower  secondary  level,  and  KR10,200  ($2.5)  at  the  upper  secondary  level. \nAccording  to  the  Socio-economic  Survey  (2004),  annual  educational  expenses  per  student  includes  school  fees, \ntuition,  textbooks,  school  supplies,  gifts  to  teachers,  and  contributions  to  building  funds.  Households  estimate \neducational  expenses  at  KR50,000  ($12.5)  for  preschool  and  primary  school  students,  KR393,000  ($100)  for \nsecondary school students, KR1.1 million ($275) for technical or vocational school students and KR 2.1 million ($525) \nfor university students. According to the Socio-economic Survey (2004), parents are willing to pay 10 times as much \nfor  quality  private  schooling,  especially  at  the  secondary  level.  This  is  more  common  among  the  more  affluent \nhouseholds in urban areas who are willing to pay substantially for high-quality education.  \n \nThe Project aims to increase the NER of children of disadvantaged families and/or areas in secondary education from \n73% in 2006\u20132007 to 80% by 2020. The Project will employ a number of strategies aimed at addressing the impacts \nof poverty and other associated factors on the educational attainment of children in disadvantaged areas.  \nC.  Participation Process \nIs there a stakeholder analysis? \nA number of approaches were used to consult with stakeholders during project preparation, such as (i) a review of key \ndocuments and regulations, (ii) key informant interviews, (iii) meetings, (iv) task force and technical working group \nmeetings, (v) visits to relevant institutions, (vi) national workshops, (vii) the education sector working group, and (viii) a \n\n  Yes \n\n   No  \n\n                                                 \n1   National Institute of Statistic, Ministry of Planning. 2005.

Key stakeholders include: Ministry of Education, Youth and Sport (MoEYS) \nline departments; provincial education offices; teacher training institutions; district level education offices; project-level \noffices; primary schools, lower secondary schools, and upper secondary schools; and development partners such as \nthe World Bank, the European Union, Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), the United Nations Children's \nFund (UNICEF), and the United Stated Agency for International Development (USAID). \n \nIs there a participation strategy? \n \nA participation strategy is integral to project implementation, which reflects the consultation process at the central, \nprovincial, district, institutional, and project levels that was undertaken during project preparation.  \nD.  Gender Development \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \nAccording to the Cambodia Inter-censal Population Survey 2004,3 in urban areas the unemployment rate of females is \n6.7%, compared with 7.6% among males. In rural areas the unemployment rate of males is also marginally higher. A \nnumber of studies reveal a link between poverty and the higher drop out rates among female students at secondary \nlevel, especially in the disadvantaged areas.4 Poverty helps widen gender disparities in enrolment and literacy. Among \nfemales,  drop  out  rates  reduce  with  each  successive  grade  completed.  Although  direct  costs  of  education  are  the \nsame  for  boys  and  girls,  parents  generally  perceive  higher  opportunity  costs  and  lower  benefits  from  educating \ndaughters.  Opportunity  costs  increase  with  the  increase  in  age  of  girls,  especially  when  they  reach  an  age  officially \nacceptable for entry into the formal job market. \n \nStrategies designed to maximize project impact on females include creating an environment conducive to increasing \nfemale literacy and retention rates through (i) better information dissemination to stakeholders including communities \nand  parents;  (ii)  sex  disaggregated  data  collection  and  analysis;  (iii)  improved  upper  secondary  school  facilities  for \nequitable  access  (e.g.,  separate  toilets  for  girls  and  dormitories  for  female  students);  (iv)  greater  proportion  of \nscholarships  for  females;  (v)  orientation  session  on  gender,  disability,  and  ethnic  minority  issues  for  writers  of \ninstructional  materials  to  encourage  equitable  access  for  children  from  disadvantaged  areas;  (vi)  gender  awareness \nsessions included in the teacher training and leadership training programs; and (vii) monitoring and evaluation of the \nimplementation of the gender mainstreaming policy connected to an education management information system (MIS) \nreview. Gender-responsive outputs and indicators are also included in the design and monitoring framework.

The Project targets support to improve the quality of, and achieve \ngreater equity of, education by (i) strengthening capacity of institutions and agencies responsible \nfor  delivery  of  quality  education,  (ii)  improving  teaching  quality,  and  (iii)  strengthening  and \nexpanding the reach of quality secondary education. A gender action plan is prepared to highlight \nthe specific needs and interests of female students and teachers in upper secondary education in \nCambodia. It helps to ensure that women have equal access to training opportunities at all levels. \nThe gender action plan includes actions aimed at (i) facilitating performance and retention of girls \nfrom poor families in upper secondary schools, (ii) increasing the number of female teachers at \nsecondary  schools,  and  (iii)  promoting  equal  participation  of  female  staff  for  quality  secondary \neducation. The gender action plan is based on the gender analysis prepared for the Project. It is \ndesigned  according  to  the  Asian  Development  Bank\u2019s  (ADB\u2019s)  Policy  on  Gender  and \nDevelopment (1998), MoEYS\u2019 Gender Policy in Education (2006),1 and A Fair Share for Women: \nCambodia Gender Assessment.2 \n \nA. \n \n2. \nWhile gender disparities in education have decreased at all levels, low enrolment of boys \nand girls from remote and disadvantaged areas in secondary education remains a major issue \nin Cambodia. Four out of seven provinces classified as remote have high percentages of ethnic \nminorities.3 Net  enrolment  rates  in  primary  education  show  virtual  gender  parity.  However,  the \ntotal net enrolment ratio in 2006\u20132007 is 33.7% (33.1% for females) at lower secondary schools \nand  12.5%  (11.3%  for  females)  at  upper  secondary  schools.  In  both  urban  and  rural  areas, \nmore females are moving into higher grades and repetition rates are lower than that of males. \nHowever,  drop  out  rates  for  women  are  still  higher  in  urban  and  rural  areas  than  they  are  for \nmales.  Table  A5.1  illustrates  the  number  and  percentage  of  females  that  enroll  and  repeat \ngrade 9, and transition to upper secondary school based on 2006\u20132007 Ministry of Education, \nYouth and Sport (MoEYS) statistics. \n\nGender Issues in Upper Secondary Education \n\nTable A5.1: Percent of Female Lower Secondary Students that Complete Grade 9 \nand Transit to Upper Secondary School \n\nItem \n\nGrade 9 Enrolments  \n(2005\u20132006) \nFemale \n\nNumber of Students \nRepeating Within that Year \n(2005\u20132006) \nFemale \n\nTotal \n\nTransition Rate to Upper \nSecondary School (%) \n\n% \n44 \n41 \n42 \n42 \n37 \n39 \n45 \n38 \n40 \n44 \n39 \n\nTotal \n44,619 \n105,795 \n1,464 \n151,878 \n219 \n502 \n900 \n1,052 \n1,028 \n1,283 \n443 \n\nTotal \n\nUrban \nRural  \nRemote \n \nMondulkiri \nRatanakiri \nStung Treng \nOtdar Meanchey  \nKoh Kong  \nPreah Vihear  \nPailin \n\n19,746 \n43,745 \n614 \n64,105 \n82 \n196 \n408 \n397 \n414 \n566 \n173 \nSource: MoEYS. 2007.

Among  female  students, \ndrop-out rates reduce with each successive grade completed. Although direct costs of education \nare the same for boys and girls, parents generally perceive higher opportunity costs and lower \nbenefits from educating their daughters. Opportunity costs increase with the increase in the age \nof  girls,  especially  when  they  reach  an  age  officially  acceptable  for  entry  into  the  formal  job \nmarket. Common barriers for girls in accessing upper secondary education include poor quality \neducation, security, lack of toilets, lack of educational materials, early marriage, and the lack of \nfemale teachers in rural secondary schools.  \n \n4. \nEnhanced quality of education has a direct impact on poverty reduction, as it is a priority \narea  in  human  development  and  capacity  building.  Only  4%  of  the  labor  force  in  2004  had \nreceived upper secondary or postsecondary education, according to the Socio-economic Survey \n(2004).5 The overall unemployment rate in urban areas was 7% (6.7% for females and 7.6% for \nmales) in 2004, according to the Cambodia Inter-censal Population Survey 2004. In rural areas, \nthe unemployment rate for males is marginally higher than the rate for females. Improved quality \nsecondary  education  not  only  improves  employment  opportunities  for  young  people  but  also \nimproves  the  skills  efficiency  and  productivity  of  human  resources  for  more  than  half  of \nCambodia\u2019s population (women comprise about 52% of Cambodia\u2019s total population).  \n \n5. \nIn  addition,  quality  secondary  education  for  young  women  contributes  to  better  health, \nfamily welfare, economic growth, and intergenerational benefits. Educated mothers have fewer \nchildren,  provide  better  nutrition  for  their  children  leading  to  improved  family  health,  and  also \nprovide  for  a  fairer  and  more  equitable  intrahousehold  allocation  of  resources,  thus  reducing \nfuture  gender  disparities.  Educated  mothers  tend  to  use  health  services  more  frequently, \nincreasing  efficiencies  of  health  care  investments.  This  has  been  demonstrated  by  the  recent \ndecline in total fertility rate from 4.0 children per mother to 3.3 children per mother (2005 CMDG \nReport).6 \n \nB. \n \nGender  disparities  also  exist  within  MoEYS  and  within  the  education  service.  Within \n6. \nMoEYS, few women are appointed to top-level positions. Based on 2005 data, there is a total of \n102,712  officials  in  MoEYS.  There  is  no  female  secretary  of  state  or  under  secretary  of  state. \nWhile  females  are  not  found  at  the  director  or  inspector-general  levels,  about  5%  of  deputy \ndirectors  or  inspectors  general  are  women.  Females  account  for  about  10%  of  department \ndirectors  and  12%  of  deputy  directors.  About  7.1%  off  upper  secondary  school  directors  and \n7.6% of vice directors are female (Table A5.2). \n \nThe  proportion  of  female  teachers  in  lower  and  upper  secondary  levels  has  remained \n7. \nrelatively  constant.  In  2005,  about  one  third  of  an  estimated  7,000  upper  secondary  school \nteachers  and  one  third  of  an  estimated  25,000  lower  secondary  school  teachers  were  female \n(Table  A5.2).  This  is  due  to  a  number  of  reasons:  (i)  low  levels  of  qualification  of  lower  and \nupper  secondary  female  teachers,  (ii)  lack  of  training  opportunities,  (iii)  lack  of  teachers  in \nremote and rural areas due to safety concerns, (iv) difficult logistics (e.g., inadequate housing, \n                                                 \n4   MoEYS.  2006.

The  Government\u2019s  Rectangular  Strategy  for  Growth, \nEmployment, Equity and Efficiency sets out Cambodia\u2019s strategy on education. In particular, the \nstrategy  targets  enhancing  human  resources  with  high  technical  and  scientific  skills  that \neffectively  respond  to  the  labor  market.  The  National  Strategic  Development  Plan  2006\u20132010 \ntargets  education  as  one  of  the  important  vehicles  for  poverty  reduction  in  the  country.  The \nNational  Strategic  Development  Plan  2006\u20132010  endorses  the  ESP  2006\u20132010,  and  includes \npoints related to the development of the teaching workforce. The Education for All (EFA) national \nplan highlights the importance of addressing gender issues at all levels and within all subsectors \nof  the  education  system. 7 The  Cambodia  Millennium  Development  Goal  states  the  target  of \nimproving the ratio of girls to boys in upper secondary education from 48% in 2001 to 100% in \n2015. \n \n9. \nand direction of education (Article 2), and more specifically in educational services (Article 41): \n\nThe draft Education Law emphasizes gender equity in education, as indicated in its goal \n\n(i)  Article  41  (Quality  EFA).

Increased government and household spending on education at all levels \nhas had a direct impact on access and participation. During this same period, enrolments in \nprimary  schools,  lower  secondary  schools,  and  upper  secondary  schools  have  increased \nsubstantially. The Government\u2019s long-term goal is to develop a sustainable and competitive \neconomy  in  Cambodia.  The  Rectangular  Strategy  for  Growth,  Employment,  Equity  and \nEfficiency  reflects  the  Government's  determination  and  commitment  in  this  regard.  One  of \nthe  four  important  pillars  of  the  strategy  is  capacity  building  and  human  resource \ndevelopment,  in  which  enhancing  education  quality  has  been  identified  as  the  key  to \nachieving  the  long-term  goal  of  developing  a  sustainable  and  competitive  economy.  The \nstrategy has been acting as a base guide for establishing (and revising) the Education for All \n(EFA) plan, Education Strategic Plan (ESP), Education Sector Support Program (ESSP), all \nof which are consistently working towards achieving long-term EFA goals (2015) by ensuring \nequitable  access  to  basic  and  postbasic  education,  enabling  quality  and  efficiency \nimprovement, and capacity building for decentralization. \n \n3. \nWhile  significant  resources  and  attention  have  been  directed  to  all  education  levels \n(particularly  the  basic  level,  grades  1\u20139),  improved  access  and  quality  in  the  education \nsector as a whole remain critical. This is even more critical for the secondary education level, \nwhere  students  must  obtain  adequate  knowledge  and  skills  to  align  with  the  increased \ndemands (in number and quality) of the labor market.1 The socioeconomic, political, cultural, \nand labor-market climate of the country calls for improvement of education quality, including \n(i) preservice and in-service teacher training, (ii) physical school conditions and facilities, (iii) \ncurriculum  development  and  teaching  methods,  (iv)  adequate  provision  of  textbooks  for \nstudents  and  instructional  materials  for  teachers,  and  (v)  efficient  education  management \nsystems, i.e., quality staff and infrastructure at all education administrative levels.  \n \nCambodia became the 148th member of the World Trade Organization (WTO) on 13 \n4. \nOctober 2004. Like all least-developed countries, Cambodia's objective of WTO accession is \nto  seek  to  leverage  the  benefits  of  trade.  In  this  area,  Cambodia  is  not  only  the  first least-\ndeveloped  country  to  have  acceded  to  the  WTO,  but  is  also  a  champion  in  mainstreaming \ntrade  in  development  strategies.  As  Cambodia  is  one  of  the  fastest  growing  garment \nexporters  over  the  last  8  years,  trade  is  at  the  centre  of  the  country\u2019s  Socio-economic \nDevelopment Plan, Poverty Reduction Strategy, and the Governance Action Plan to ensure \nCambodia  develops  a  sustainable  and  competitive  economy.  To  achieve  a  sustainable \ngrowth path and to survive in a globally competitive environment, Cambodia needs to build a \ndynamic human resource base with adaptable skills. Investment under the Project consists \nof  improving  quality,  promoting  access  and  participation,  and  increasing  the  efficiency  and \neffectiveness  of  education  management  through  (i)  preservice  and  in-service  teacher \ntraining,  (ii)  physical  school  conditions  and  facilities,  (iii)  curriculum  development  and \nteaching  methods,  (iv)  adequate  provision  of  textbooks  for  students  and  instructional \nmaterials for teachers, (v) scholarship and incentive schemes, (vi) improved fiscal transfers, \n(vii)  management  training,  and  (viii)  improvement  of  education  management  systems.  The \nProject is expected to yield substantial economic, social, and institutional benefits. \n \n\n                                                 \n1   According  to  the  Cambodia  Socio-Economic  Survey,  2004,  only  4%  of  the  labor  force  in  2004  has  upper \n\nsecondary or postsecondary education. \n\n \n\n\f    \n\nB. \n \n\nBenefit \u2013 Cost Analysis \n\n1. \n\nLabor Market Demand \n\nAppendix 10        \n\n \n\n63\n\n \n5. \nThe  total  population  at  the  end  of  2006  was  estimated  at  14  million  people, \nincreasing from 11 million people in 1994. With an average annual growth rate of 1.8%, the \npopulation is projected to increase to over 15 million people in 2010. Gross domestic product \n(GDP) per capita is $385 in 2005, up from $288 in 2000. About three quarters (74.2%) of the \nemployed population work in agriculture, 18.8% work in the service sector, and only 7% work \nin the manufacturing sector. Only 0.2% of workers are an employer (or self-employed), and \n13% are paid employees. Most of the workers are self employed or unpaid family workers. \nCambodia's labor force in 2006 was 7.6 million, or 54% of the total population. As children \naged 0\u20136 years are not considered to be economically active, and only a small percentage \nof  those aged  7\u201314  years  are  in  the  labor  force,  the labor  force  participation  rate  is  higher \nwhen only older ages are considered. Thus, 65.5% of the population aged 7 years and over, \nand 83.7% of the population aged 15 years and over, are economically active.  \n \nThe  labor  market  in  Cambodia  continues  to  consist  of  predominantly  unskilled, \n6. \nagricultural,  or  household  workers.  According  to  the  Cambodia  Socio-Economic  Survey \n2004, the educated and trained labor force comprised only 4% of employed persons (at the \ntechnical professional level). The labor market will continue to increase by 4.0% per annum, \nmeaning  that  every  year  another  300,000  people  will  enter  the  labor  market.  These  are \nyoung, often unskilled workers with limited experience, who live in rural, remote,  and often \ndisadvantaged  areas  where  land  and  nonfarming  jobs  are  rare.  Those  who  will  not  be \nabsorbed by the formal sector will continue to work in household enterprises. If the private \nsector  does  not  develop  significantly,  as  planned  by  the  Government,  unemployment  will \nincrease,  especially  as  Government-owned  enterprises  and  the  agriculture  sector  employ \nfewer  people,  and  because  the  capacity  of  the  labor-intensive,  low-productivity  service \nsector is low. The Government, while reducing its monopoly in employment, has not invested \nsufficiently in retraining, which has been left to individual initiatives. \n \n7. \nThe  transition  to  a  market  economy  and  rapid  economic  growth  in  the  last  7  years \nhas raised the demand for skilled labor. Further growth promises to be more labor intensive. \nGiven  its  strong  position  and  reputation  in  export  processing,  particularly  garments  and \ntextiles, Cambodia can double its exports and create around 1 million manufacturing jobs in \nexport sectors in the immediate future. To be competitive, however, Cambodia must develop \nthe high-technology sectors and upgrade its labor force. Secondary education is particularly \nimportant to foster the needed labor skills and the capacity to learn on the job while adapting \nto  new  technologies.  Measures  must  mitigate  the  poverty  and  inequality  that  may  worsen \nwith increasing globalization. Cambodia\u2019s comparative advantage is likely to be in (i) sectors \nand  enterprises  that  require  relative  shifts  in  the  skills  for  the  export  industry  export \nmanufacture, (ii) a steady increase in labor-intensive products, and (iii) a dramatic increase \nin  science-based  goods,  including  those  that  are  technologically  complex.  An  equally \nimportant  issue  recognized  by  the  Government  is  the  promotion  of  balanced  development \nbetween  the  rich  and  poor  and/or  disadvantaged  regions.  A  large  number  of  recent \nprograms (both Government and donor initiatives) have been directed towards improving the \nsocioeconomic conditions of the poor, remote, and disadvantaged regions. Thus, education \naiming to improve labor skills for local economic development has been on the priority list.  \n \n\n2. \n\nProject Benefits and Economic Rates of Return \n\n \n\nEconomic  benefits  will  potentially  include  high  social  returns  from  the  project \n8. \ninvestment  to  be  obtained  through  (i)  improvement  in  system  efficiency  through  better \ninfrastructure and personnel, and in allocation of resources; and (ii) improved productivity of \nupper secondary school graduates. \n\n \n\n\f64 \n\nAppendix 10 \n\n  \nIn  terms  of  improvement  in  system  efficiency  through  better  infrastructure  and \n9. \npersonnel, and in allocation of resources, economic benefits will be achieved in a number of \nways. The economic benefits will be realized in the following five major ways. \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nMoEYS staff, including provincial and district office staff, will receive technical \nassistance,  training  and  support  in  planning,  management,  technical,  and \nprofessional issues. They will be trained to strengthen their capacity to plan, \nmanage, administer, and regulate the system.  \nActivities  designed  to  improve  preservice  courses  will  directly  and  indirectly \nenhance quality of management and academic staff of NIE and TTCs, as well \nas teacher trainees, preparing them for a solid professional teaching career. \nAlso,  initiatives  to  improve  in-service  training  will  help  to  substantially \nenhance the quality of the majority of secondary school teachers.  \nUpper  secondary  schools  will  be  improved  through  capacity  building  for \nschool management, school networking, and school improvement planning.  \nThe  Project  will  support  physical  and  technical  improvements  to  the \nmanagement  information  systems  (MISs)  including  the  education  MIS, \nfinance  MIS,  human  resource  MIS,  and  school  construction  MIS.  The \nsynchronization  of  the  existing  MIS  subsets  will  improve  the  monitoring  and \nplanning  capacity  of  MoEYS.  This  will \ntimely  and  correct \nmanagement  decisions,  which  will  minimize  wastage  from  both  capital  and \nrecurrent spending perspectives.  \nEfficiency  will  be  enhanced \nin  new  and \nrehabilitated infrastructure such as learning resource centers and dormitories, \nlibrary  books,  learning  equipment  for  TTCs  and  upper  secondary  schools, \nupper  secondary  school  textbooks,  and  instructional  materials  for  upper \nsecondary school teachers.  \n\nthrough  project \n\ninvestment \n\nfacilitate \n\n \n10. \nThe  economic  benefits  to  be  achieved  as  analyzed  in  the  preceding  list  will  be \nderived from the internal system efficiency of the education system by reducing the unit cost \nof producing a graduate. It is assumed that the cost saving is based on the minimum rate of \n0.5%  of  annual  recurrent  expenditure  of  the  education  sector  and  that  such  a  saving  will \nbegin  to  yield  in  year  3  of  the  project  implementation.  Based  on  these  assumptions,  the \naverage annual cost saving is $0.98 million. \n \n11.  With  regard  to  improved  productivity  of  upper  secondary  school  graduates,  the \nProject  is  expected  to  contribute  to  the  national  effort  to  increase  the  number  of  annual \nsecondary  school  graduates  (more  precisely,  upper  secondary  graduates)  by  financing \nimproved  access  to,  and  quality  of,  education.  Under  the  project  interventions,  students  in \nlower  secondary  and  upper  secondary  schools,  both  currently  and  in  the  future,  will  be \ntaught  by  better  trained  and  better  motivated  teachers  (and  hence  there  will  be  lower \nrepetition  and  drop  out  rates)  and  will  have  more  relevant  attitudes,  skills,  and  knowledge, \nand therefore be more employable. In this regard, the Project will directly improve the quality \nof  outcomes  and  performance  of  graduates  in  the  labor  market.  The  Project  will  provide \nways to raise academic standards and help improve the alignment between graduate skills \nand the labor market. Increased earning capacity and spending ability of low-income groups \nwill help reduce poverty incidence in Cambodia. \n \n12. \nProject economic benefits derived from the improved productivity of upper secondary \nschool graduates is often called productivity differential\u2014benefits from increased earnings or \ninflows.  The  quality  enhancement  measures  are  expected  to  increase  earnings  of  new \ngraduates  based  on  better  skills  and  knowledge  that  they  will  receive  as  a  result  of  the \nproject  investment.  Benefits  will  come  from  increased  earnings  because  better-qualified \n\n \n\n\f    \n\nAppendix 10        \n\n \n\n65\n\nExpected  benefits  from  productivity  differential  are  also  based  on  the  expected \n\nteachers, pedagogical approaches, equipment, facilities, and infrastructure will help improve \nstudent performance and thus improve the quality of graduates and the labor force. \n \n13. \nminimum and indicate an estimated annual benefit of $8.62 million.  \n \n14. \n The approach used in the above benefit quantification is to estimate minimum benefit \nthat  can  be  expected  from  the  proposed  investment  in  enhancing  education  quality  in \nCambodia.  The  aggregated  minimum benefit  and cost for  the Project are  outlined  in  Table \nA10.1.  Where  possible,  the  expected  benefits  have  been  summarized  in  monetary  terms, \neither  as  cost  savings  (such  as  producing  the  same  output  at  a  reduced  overall  cost)  and \nincreased  earnings  (such  as  producing  more  graduates  who  earn  more  due  to  better \neducation  and/or  contribution  to  the  local  economy).  In  all  cases,  these  benefits  exclude \nexternalities  that  accrue  to  the  Project.  Using  a  discount  rate  of  12%  as  the  economic \nopportunity  cost  of  capital,  the  economic  analysis  yield  an  economic  internal  rate  of  return \n(EIRR) of 22.4%, and a benefit-cost ratio of 1.53 in the base case. The Project is assessed \neconomically viable.  \n \n\nTable A10.1: Benefit-Cost Analysis, Base Case \nCost Streamb \nBenefit Streama \n7.68 \n0.00 \n7.15 \n0.00 \n6.86 \n3.14 \n5.44 \n4.29 \n2.58 \n5.63 \n0.95 \n7.26 \n1.47 \n9.03 \n1.47 \n10.99 \n1.47 \n12.95 \n1.47 \n14.92 \n1.47 \n16.89 \n1.47 \n18.86 \n1.47 \n20.84 \n \n \n25.90 \n39.52 \n1.53 \n \na Benefit stream includes (i) annual cost savings due to increased system efficiency; and (ii) annual \n\nNet Cash Flow \n(7.68) \n(7.15) \n(3.72) \n(1.15) \n3.05 \n6.32 \n7.56 \n9.52 \n11.48 \n13.45 \n15.42 \n17.39 \n19.37 \nEIRR \n22.4% \n \n\nYear \n2008 \n2009 \n2010 \n2011 \n2012 \n2013 \n2014 \n2015 \n2016 \n2017 \n2018 \n2019 \n2020 \n \nNPV@ 12% \nBCR \n\nSerial No. \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n \n \n \n\nb Costs are economic costs derived from financial costs applying a standard conversion factor of 0.95 \n\nproductivity differential. \n\nfor Cambodia. \n\nSource: ADB estimates. \n\n \nA  sensitivity  analysis  is  conducted  to  test  the  robustness  of  the  base-case  model. \n15. \nFive sensitive cases are examined: (i) benefit decrease of 10%, (ii) cost increase of 10%, (iii) \nbenefit  decrease  of  10%  and  cost  increase  of  10%,  (iv)  benefit  delay  of  1  year,  and  (v) \nbenefit delay of 2 years.

In  the  case  of  a \nbenefit delay of 1 year, the benefit-cost ratio is reduced from 1.53 to 1.20, EIRR is reduced \nfrom 22.4% to 15.8%, and the economic net present value is 49.9% lower. In the case of a \nbenefit delay of 2 years, the benefit-cost ratio is reduced from 1.53 to 0.92, EIRR is reduced \nfrom 22.4% to 10.3% (or 1.7% lower than the 12% threshold), and the economic net present \nvalue  is  92.2%  lower,  suggesting  that  a  benefit  delay  of  2  years  would  make  the  Project \neconomically unviable.  \n \n17. \nBased  on  this  analysis,  it  is  recommended  that  MoEYS  (the  executing  agency), \nclosely  follows  the  agreed  project  implementation  schedule  to  ensure  project  benefits  are \nrealized  as  scheduled.  It  further  implies  that  the  factors  delaying  project  implementation \nshould  be  well  under  control  and  minimized  to  ensure  the  project  economic  viability  and \nsustainability.  \n \nC. \n \n18. \nThe fiscal impact of the Project is important as it helps assess the sustainability level. \nIn  practice,  education  projects  often  support  recurrent  expenditures  as  well  as  capital \noutlays, thus making the recurrent cost sustainability issue one of central importance for the \neconomic  analysis.  The  impact  on  the  overall  budget  once  the  Project  is  completed  often \ndetermines whether the Project objectives will be sustained in the long run. A key issue to be \naddressed includes what impacts the investment in the project will have on fiscal indicators \nsuch as total annual budget, and capital and recurrent expenditure for the education sector \nin Cambodia during and after the implementation period of the Project.  \n \n19. \nThe  Project  has  been  designed  bearing  in  mind  that  recurrent  costs  should  be \nminimized for the Government and the community. The improvement of the quality support \nsystems under the Project is intended to reduce wastage, improve the internal efficiency of \nthe education sector (with a particular focus on the secondary education level), and reduce \nthe  cost  of  producing  an  upper  secondary  school  graduate  in  Cambodia.  The  incremental \nrecurrent Project costs arise largely from increased access to secondary schooling through \nenhanced  quality  and  relevance.  The  costs  of  civil  works  and  learning  facilities  have  been \nminimized  by  using  efficient  designs  and  maximizing  the  utilization  of  locally  available \nresources  and  materials.  Although  new  construction  and  rehabilitation  works  are  being \nfinanced,  sustainability  is  being  ensured  by  the  Government\u2019s  commitment  to  operate  and \nmaintain facilities after the project implementation period. \n \n20. \nThe  total  financial  cost  of  the  Project,  inclusive  of  taxes,  duties,  contingencies,  and \ninterest  charges,  is  $33.40  million  for  an  implementation  period  of  5  years.  The  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) will finance 81%, and the Government will finance the remainder. \nThe analysis indicates that the Project will have negligible impact on the state budget for the \neducation sector. The recurrent expenditure to be paid by the Government after the project \nimplementation  is  estimated  to  be  $1.47  million  per  annum  and  includes  incremental  staff \nremuneration,  operation  and  maintenance  costs  of  civil  works,  facilities,  equipment,  and \nvehicles  procured  under  the  Project.  It  is  indicated  that  the  project  recurrent  expenditure \nafter  project  implementation  (2014\u20132020)  will  only  account  for  an  average  of  0.58%  of \nannual recurrent expenditure allocated to the education sector during the 2014\u20132020 period. \nIt is observed that this proportion will be much smaller than the threshold of 5.0%. \n \n\n \n\n\f", "author_pages": ["CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 8 October 2007) \n", "Currency Unit\n", "riel/s (KR) \n", "KR1.00\n$1.00\n", "$.0002467612 \nKR4,052.50 \n", " \n", "\u2013 \n", "= \n= \n", "ADB \nEA \nEFA \nEIRR \nESP \nESSP \nEVEP \nGDP \nGER \nICT \nJICA \nMIS \nMoEYS \nNER \nNGO \nNIE \nPDH \nPRD \nSida \nTTC \nTTD \nUNICEF \nUSAID \nWTO \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "ABBREVIATIONS \n", "Asian Development Bank \nexecuting agency \nEducation for All \neconomic internal rate of return \nEducation Strategic Plan \nEducation Sector Support Program \nElective Vocational Education Program  \ngross domestic product \ngross enrolment ratio \ninformation and communication technology \nJapan International Cooperation Agency \nmanagement information system \nMinistry of Education, Youth and Sport \nnet enrolment ratio \nnongovernment organization \nNational Institute of Education \nPublishing and Distribution House \nPedagogic Research Department \nSwedish International Development Cooperation Agency  \nteacher training college \nTeacher Training Department \nUnited Nations Children's Fund \nUnited Stated Agency for International Development \nWorld Trade Organization \n", "NOTES \n", "The  fiscal  year  (FY)  of  the  Government  ends  on  31  December.
