The \nmain  transmission  channel  is  remittances,  which  have  driven \neconomic  growth  in  recent  years.  Remittances  are  expected  to \ndecline by at least 35% in 2009 (from $2.6 billion in 2008) due to \nthe  Russian  Federation  and \nthe  economic  slowdown \nKazakhstan.  Export  earnings  have  also  fallen  to  the  decline  in \nglobal  demand  for  aluminum  and  cotton,  which  are  Tajikistan's \nmain exports. \n \nThe  International  Monetary  Fund  (IMF)  is  forecasting  2%  growth \nin  real  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  in  2009,  compared  to  8% \ngrowth  in  2008.  More  than  half  of  tax  revenues  are  linked  to \nremittance-fueled  imports,  and  authorities  are  projecting  a  large \nrevenue  shortfall  of  over  3%  of  GDP  in  relation  to  the  2009 \nbudget. The current account deficit will likely exceed 10% of GDP. \nNet  international  reserves  equal  about  $170  million,  providing \nimport  cover  for  only  about  1  month.  The  near-term  economic \noutlook  is  subject  to  significant  downside  risks  as  the  global \neconomic outlook continues to be downgraded. \n \n\nin \n\n \n\nRecipient \n\nProposal  \n\nClassification \n\n \nEnvironment \nAssessment \n \nSocial Safeguards \nAssessment \n\n \nRationale and \nDescription \n\n \n\n\f \n\nii \n \n\n \n\n \nSpecial Features \n\nMany  low-income  households  rely  on  remittances  to  meet  basic \nneeds.  About  100,000  migrant  workers  returned  to  Tajikistan \nduring  the  first  quarter  of  2009,  and  many  more  are  expected  in \nthe coming months. Unemployment, which is already estimated to \nbe about 40%, is likely to rise sharply as a result of the economic \nslowdown, as well as the large influx of migrant workers. Poverty \nand social impacts of the crisis will be direct and immediate.   \n \nThe  need  for  countercyclical  fiscal  policies  and  social  safety  net \nmeasures  is  urgent.  However,  lack  of  fiscal  space\u2014exacerbated \nby  the  crisis\u2014constrains  the  Government's  ability  to  implement \nsuch measures. \n \nThe  Tajikistan  Crisis  Recovery  Support  Program  will  provide \nshort-term  fiscal  stimulus  to  mitigate  the  economic  and  social \nimpact  of  the  crisis.  The  program  will  help  meet  critical  public \nexpenditures  such  as  social  allowances,  employment  programs, \nsubventions  to  poor  regions,  and  the  food,  medicine  and  utility \nexpenses of social institutions.  \n \nThe program is fully in line with the Government's crisis mitigation \nprogram.  In  the  revised  2009  budget,  the  Government  has \nprioritized  specific  social  and  safety  net  expenditures.  Program \nproceeds  will  help  meet  some  of \nthe  prioritized  public \nexpenditures. \n \nThe program has four special features: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nis  structured  on \n\ncrisis  mitigation \n\nIt  is  anchored  on  the  IMF's  Poverty  Reduction  and \nGrowth  Facility  (PRGF),  which  sets  out  the  key \nmacroeconomic  parameters  and \nidentifies  priority \nreform measures.  \nIt uses the program-based approach recognized under \nthe  program  lending  policy  of  the  Asian  Development \nthe \nBank  (ADB).  The  program \nGovernment's \nThe \nGovernment  has  adopted  a  crisis  budget,  which  cuts \nnon-essential expenditures and prioritizes social sector \nspending.  ADB's  financing  will  be  part  of  the  overall \nfinancing plan of the crisis mitigation program. \nIn  order  to  swiftly  meet  the  countercyclical  fiscal \nstimulus needs of Tajikistan, and minimize transaction \ncosts  at  a  time  of  acute  crisis,  the  program  does  not \nimpose  any  separate  policy  conditions.  Instead,  the \nPRGF  and  the  Government's  own  crisis  mitigation \nprogram  will  provide  the  overall  macroeconomic  and \nreform framework. \n\nprogram. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nExecuting and \nImplementing Agencies \n\nTranching \n\n \nFinancing Plan \n\nProcurement and \nDisbursement \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nCounterpart funds \n\n(iv) \n\nADB will focus on ensuring good financial management \nof  the  crisis  mitigation  program  through  technical \nassistance  and  close  coordination  with  other \ndevelopment partners.   \n\n \nThe Ministry of Finance (MOF) will be the executing agency. MOF \nand the Ministry of Labor and Social Protection of the Population \n(MLSPP) will be the main implementing agencies. \n\nThe  $40  million  grant  will  be  disbursed  in  a  single  tranche  upon \ndeclaration  of  grant  effectiveness.  Immediately  following  the \ndisbursement, the Government will transfer an equivalent amount \nin  somoni  to  a  special  account,  dedicated  for  crisis  mitigation \nmeasures. This account will finance only eligible social safety net \nexpenditures agreed upon between the Government and ADB. \n \nThe  proposed  grant  is  part  of  a  financing  plan  comprising \nassistance  from  several  multilateral  development  partners  to \nmitigate the impact of the crisis. The Government has requested a \ngrant of $40 million from ADB's Special Funds resources.  \n \nGrant  proceeds  will  be  used  to  pay  for  items  procured  in  ADB \nmember  countries,  other  than  the  items  specified  in  the  list  of \nineligible  items  and  imports  financed  by  other  bilateral  and \nmultilateral sources. \n \nthe  program  grant  will  be  disbursed \nin \nThe  proceeds  of \naccordance  with \nthe  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s  simplification  of \ndisbursement  procedures  and  related  requirements  for  program \ngrants.  Grant  proceeds  disbursed  against  imports  will  require  a \ncertificate  from  the  Government  stipulating  that  the  value  of  the \ntotal  imports  of  Tajikistan,  minus  its  imports  from  nonmember \ncountries,  ineligible  imports,  and  imports  financed  under  other \nofficial  development  assistance,  is  equal  to  or  greater  than  the \namount of the grant expected to be disbursed during a particular \nyear. ADB reserves the right to audit the use of grant proceeds to \nverify the accuracy of the Government\u2019s certification. \n \nThe  Government  shall  ensure  that  the  local  currency  generated \nfrom the proceeds of the ADF grant shall be used predominantly \nto  finance  the  Government's  crisis  budget,  and  thereby  maintain \nthe core public expenditure program of Tajikistan. Specifically, the \ncounterpart  proceeds  shall  be  prioritized  to  meet  selected  social \nsafety net expenditures. \n\n \nPeriod of Utilization \n \nEstimated Program \nCompletion Date \n \n\n31 December 2009 \n \n30 June 2010 (due to auditing processes) \n \n \n\niii\n\n \n\n\f \n\niv \n \n\nBenefits  \n\n \nRisks and Assumptions \n \n\n \n\nin \n\nformulating \n\nTajikistan  has  been  severely  affected  by  the  crisis.  The  program \nwill  support Government  efforts  to  cushion  the adverse  impact  of \nthe  crisis  through  appropriate  fiscal  policies  and  safety  net \nprograms.  The  immediate  beneficiaries  will  be  the  poor  and \nvulnerable groups who are hardest hit by the crisis.  \n \nThere  are  three  main  risks.  First,  the  global  downturn  could  be \nmore  protracted  than  anticipated.  Continuing  deterioration  in  the \nglobal  economic  situation\u2014and  particularly  the  outlook  for  the \nRussian  Federation  and  Kazakhstan\u2014could  lead  to  more  severe \nimpacts  on  Tajikistan\u2019s  economy.  Second,  rising  uncertainty  and \ncompeting  needs  and  priorities  could  slow  the  Government\u2019s \nimplementation of appropriate policy responses. \n \nThe  Government  has  been  proactive \nits \nmacroeconomic stabilization and countercyclical fiscal policies. In \nNovember 2008, the Government established the inter-ministerial \ncrisis  management  committee  (ICMC)  chaired  by  the  Prime \nMinister.  The  ICMC  has  adopted  a  crisis  management  plan \ncovering  monetary,  fiscal  and  financial  sector  policies  and  social \nsafety  net  programs.  Within  the  ICMC  framework,  MOF  has \nfinalized  the  revised  2009  budget  to  reflect  the  revenue  shortfall \nand expenditure priorities.  \n \nDevelopment  partners  have  responded  quickly  with  policy  advice \nand financial assistance. To meet the balance-of-payments needs \narising  from  the  crisis,  the  IMF  recently  approved  a  $116  million \nPRGF.  The  World  Bank  has  approved  $20  million  in  budget \nsupport under the Third Programmatic Development Policy Grant \nin March 2009. The European Commission is also taking steps to \nfast-track  disbursement  under  two  ongoing  projects  to  provide \nbudget support in 2009.   \n \nA  third  risk  is  that  poor  design  and  weak  fiduciary  controls  may \nhamper  the  efficacy  of  the  crisis  mitigation  plans.  The  program \ndesign  is  straightforward  and  there  is  no  complex  targeting  or \nidentification  of  beneficiaries  involved.  ADB,  in  collaboration  with \nthe other development partners, will work with the Government in \nadhering to good financial management practices in executing the \ncrisis mitigation program. \n \n \n\n\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed grant \n\n1. \nto the Republic of Tajikistan for Crisis Recovery Support Program.1  \n \n\nII. \n\nMACROECONOMIC CONTEXT  \n\nA. \n\nRecent Economic Performance \n\n2. \nTajikistan  recorded  strong  macroeconomic  performance  in  recent  years.  Despite  a \nnumber of exogenous shocks, including natural disasters and adverse weather conditions, the \neconomy grew at an average of 7.4% per year during 2005\u20132008 (Table 1). Aggregate demand \nwas  driven  primarily  by  consumer  spending  and  investment.  The  expansion  in  domestic \ndemand  was  attributable  to  external  sources,  and  remittance  inflows\u2014which  surged  from                \n$82 million in 2003 to $2.6 billion in 2008\u2014were instrumental in fueling household consumption. \nAt the same time, donor-financed public investment projects boosted domestic capital formation. \n \nTable 1: Tajikistan Economic Indicators \n\n1.

The  international  food  and  fuel  price  shocks  in  2008  aggravated  this  trend,  and \ninflation peaked at 26% by mid-2008, before leveling at 11% (year-on-year) in December 2008. \n \nTajikistan  suffers  from  persistent  trade  imbalances  due  to  its  narrow  range  of  exports \n4. \nand high import dependence. Aluminum and cotton fiber account for roughly 83% of Tajikistan's \nexports.  Alumina, oil products and foodstuff are its principal imports. The trade deficit reached \n48% of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2008, and the current account deficit was 9%. Large \nremittance inflows helped keep the somoni relatively stable by partly offsetting trade imbalances. \nForeign direct investment is low (about 3.7% of GDP), and concentrated in few sectors.  \n \n5. \nAided  by  higher-than-expected  revenue  collection  and  expenditure  controls,  the  overall \nfiscal  balance  registered  a  surplus  equivalent  to  1.3%  of  GDP  in  2008.  Likewise,  restraint  in \npublic  sector  borrowing;  debt  relief  by  the  Russian  Federation,  Pakistan  and  the  International \nMonetary Fund (IMF); and rapid GDP growth helped improve debt sustainability indicators. The \nratio  of  private  and  public  sector  external  debt  to  GDP  improved  to  43%  in  2008  from  53%  in \n2005.  However,  there  are  vulnerabilities,  and  a  recent  debt  sustainability  assessment  urges \ncaution  in  incurring  new  debt  and  careful  vetting  of  large-scale  projects  to  ensure  external \nresources are used productively.2 \n \nB. \n\nShort-Term Challenges: Impact of the Global Financial Crisis \n\n6. \nIn 2009, the severe impact of the global financial crisis presents an immediate challenge \nto  Tajikistan.  Without  adequate  mitigating  measures,  Tajikistan  will  be  unable  to  sustain \nmacroeconomic stability and contain the impact on the poor and vulnerable.  \n \n7. \nPoverty  and  Social  Impact.  The  effect  of  the  crisis  in  terms  of  poverty  and  social \nimpacts will be direct and immediate. A 2007 Asian Development Bank (ADB) survey indicated \nthat  as  many  as  40%  of  all  households  and  71%  of  households  in  the  lowest  quintile  receive \nremittances.3 Low-income households use remittances to meet basic needs. Unemployment will \nlikely rise sharply as a result of the economic slowdown, as well as the large influx of migrant \nworkers. The Government's social assistance programs are likewise at risk of being curtailed as \nthe global financial crisis reduces fiscal resources (Appendix 2). \n \n8. \nRemittances and Exports.  The global financial crisis and economic downturn will have \na  significant  impact  on  remittances.  Remittances  from  Tajik  overseas  migrant  workers  have \nsurged  in  recent  years  and  peaked  at  $2.6  billion  (50%  of  GDP)  in  late  2008  (Figure  1). \nRemittance-linked  consumption  and  construction  have  propelled  domestic  demand  and \neconomic growth.   \n \nMost  of  the  over  1  million  Tajik  migrant  workers  were  employed  in  the  Russian \n9. \nFederation  and  Kazakhstan.  A  Ministry  of  Labor  and  Social  Protection  of  the  Population \n(MLSPP) survey4 undertaken in January 2009 indicates that about 20% of the returned migrants \nhad  lost  their  jobs,  12%  were  deported,  18%  returned  for  personal  reasons  and  50%  were \nseasonal  workers.  Faced  with  weakening  job  markets,  many  countries  are  tightening \nimmigration rules. The Russian Federation and Kazakhstan have already significantly reduced \n\n                                                 \n2  IMF. 2009.

MLSPP estimates that at least 100,000 migrant workers returned \nto Tajikistan during the first quarter of 2009, and many more are expected in coming months as \nthe economic situation in the main host countries continue to deteriorate.   \n \nIn addition, the sharp devaluation of the Russian ruble and Kazakh tenge have reduced \n10. \nthe  value  of  remittances  when  measured  in  US  dollars  or  somoni.5 Remittances  declined  by \n33% during January\u2013April 2009 compared to the same period in 2008.

Export earnings are projected to decline sharply in 2009 as a result of declining global \ndemand.   \n \n12. \nFinancial  Sector  Impact.  Tajikistan's  financial  sector  is  composed  primarily  of \ncommercial  banks,  and  lacks  strong  global  linkages.  Therefore  direct  impacts  on  the  financial \nsector have thus far been limited. Nevertheless, there are considerable risks. Foreign and local \n\n                                                 \n5 The ruble has depreciated by 35% and the tenge by 20% against the US dollar since August 2008. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n4 \n \n\ncurrency deposits have declined due to the slowdown in remittances, as well as lower deposits \nfrom  large  corporate  clients  such  as  Talco.  A  number  of  banks  have  experienced  liquidity \nproblems  and  have  used  the  liquidity  facility  of  the  National  Bank  of  Tajikistan  (NBT),  with  a \nlending volume of about TJS2 million for up to 3 months. Asset quality may likely decline due to \nthe economic slowdown, as well as the depreciation of the somoni, because many businesses \nthat have borrowed in US dollars have local currency revenues. Bank profitability has also been \nhurt  by  the  reduction  in  remittance-related  fees.  The  NBT  has  intensified  supervision  and \ndeveloped  contingency  plans  in  case  of  further  economic  deterioration,  and/or  a  collapse  in \nconfidence. \n \n13. \nNear-Term Outlook.  Tajikistan's  near-term  economic  outlook  has  deteriorated \nconsiderably. The IMF estimates that there will be 2% growth in real GDP in 2009, down from \n8% in 2008. The IMF also emphasizes that there is considerable downside risk to this outlook. \nThe  current  account  deficit  for  2009  is  projected  to  reach  10%  of  GDP.  Foreign  direct \ninvestment  will  decline  from  the  already  low  level  of  $190  million  to  $100  million  in  2009.  Net \ninternational reserves are currently precariously low ($170 million), covering less than 1 month \nof imports. The IMF estimates a balance-of-payment financing gap of $154 million for 2009. The \nofficial unemployment rate is 2%, but actual unemployment and underemployment are believed \nto  be  as  high  as  40%.  The  unemployment  rate  will  rise  sharply  as  the  economy  slows  and \nmigrant workers return in significant numbers.   \n \n14. \nTax  revenues  have  declined  as  a  result  of  the  economic  slowdown,  and  because \nremittance-linked  imports  account  for  60%  of  total  revenues  (Appendix  3).  The  authorities  are \nprojecting  a  revenue  shortfall  of  at  least  14.5%  (about  $166.8  million,  or  3.2%  of  GDP) \ncompared  to  the  approved  2009  budget.  At  the  same  time,  expenditures  have  increased \nbecause  of  larger-than-expected  depreciation  of  the  currency  and  adjustments  in  salaries  and \nutilities tariffs. While reduction in non-critical expenditures will provide some fiscal space, there \nis  an  urgent  need  for  external  financing  to  enable  timely  and  effective  countercyclical  fiscal \npolicies. \n \n15. \nlinkages between the current crisis and social expenditures and household incomes.   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nThe impact of the crisis is summarized in the problem tree below.

Tajikistan's \nsocial  indicators  are  relatively  good  for  its  per  capita  income  level,  reflecting  the  country\u2019s \n                                                 \n6   Based on purchasing power parity of $2.15 (for poverty) and $1 (for extreme poverty) per day.  \n\n5\n\n \n\n\f \n\n6 \n \n\nalready  high  level  of  human  development  at  the  time  of  independence.  For  example,  in  2005, \nthe infant mortality rate was 59 per 1,000 live births, and the net primary school enrollment rate \nwas  97.5%.  However,  social  indicators  have  been  slow  to  improve.  A  large  segment  of  the \npopulation,  especially  in  rural  areas,  lacks  access  to  basic  services  such  as  water,  sanitation, \nand electricity. It will be difficult for Tajikistan to achieve many of the Millennium Development \nGoals (MDGs). \n \n17. \nThe  narrow  economic  base  and  high  dependence  on  a  few  commodities  make  the \ncountry  highly  vulnerable  to  exogenous  shocks.  Agriculture,  which  accounts  for  22%  of  GDP, \nhas  remained  concentrated  on  cotton,  a  sector  with  significant  distortions  that  undermine \nproductivity and profitability. Industrial activity, which is largely under state control and accounts \nfor  roughly  28%  of  GDP,  is  concentrated  in  aluminum  smelters  and  hydroelectric  power \ngeneration. In 2008, the service sector accounted for about 50% of GDP, but its share in total \nemployment was only 27%.  \n \n18. \nGeographic  isolation  and  inadequate  infrastructure  hinder  international  integration  and \ntrade.  Despite  its  vast  hydropower  potential,  Tajikistan  faces  chronic  water  and  energy \nshortages  due  to  underinvestment  in  these  sectors,  poor  sector  management,  and  limited \nprogress  in  regional  energy  cooperation.  These  shortages  have  had  a  crippling  effect  on  the \neconomy, and impose hardship on the population. \n \n19. \nTajikistan's  structural  reform  record  has  been  mixed.  Ongoing  efforts  and  progress  in \neducation  and  health  service  delivery  through  improved  financial  management  and  wage \nreforms are noteworthy. To improve the financial viability of the energy sector, the Government \nhas  recently  raised  gas  and  electricity  tariffs.  On  the  other  hand,  limited  progress  has  been \nmade  in  strengthening  the  governance  and  transparency  of  large  state-owned  enterprises, \nincluding the largest aluminum smelter (Talco) and the monopoly power utility company (Barki \nTajik).  \n \n20. \nIn March 2007, the Government issued Resolution 111, which aims to stop government \ninterference  in  the  production,  marketing  and  sale  of  cotton  and  to  address  other  key \nimpediments  through  (i)  farm  debt  resolution,  (ii)  land  reform,  and  (iii)  improved  access  to \nfinance. The resolution is being implemented, although progress has been slower than expected.   \n \n21. \nPrivate  sector  development  is  constrained  by  an  ineffective  regulatory  framework  and \nlimited access to finance. The World Bank's Doing Business report 2009 ranked Tajikistan 159 \nout  of  181  countries,  with  particularly  poor  scores  on  rules  and  procedures  pertaining  to \nbusiness start up, permits and licenses, access to credit, investor protection, tax administration, \nand cross-border trade.7 \n \nThe  Government  has  been  dealing  with  these  medium-term  challenges  with  support \n22. \nfrom  various  development  partners  including  ADB.  Its  immediate  priority,  however,  is  to  deal \nwith  the  impact  of  the  global  financial  crisis.  The  steps  taken  by  the  Government  are  outlined \nbelow. \n \nD. \n \n23. \ninter-ministerial  crisis \nmanagement  committee  (ICMC)  chaired  by  the  Prime  Minister.

Under  the  approved  2009  budget,  a  budget \ndeficit of TJS181 million ($51 million), equivalent to 0.8% of GDP, was projected (column 1 of \nTable  2).10 The  overall  financing  requirement  was  estimated  at  TJS288  million  ($81  million). \nThis was to be funded through external and domestic financing.  \n \n27. \nThe slowdown in the domestic economy, drop in export prices and decline in remittances \nhave significantly eroded the tax base.11 Tax collections for the first quarter of 2009 were 14% \nbelow  target.  Similarly,  actual  nontax  revenues  are  lagging  behind  targets.  As  a  result,  the \nGovernment has projected an aggregate tax and nontax revenue shortfall of at least 15%. The \nreduction in revenue projections also takes into account the lowering of the rates of value-added \nand profit taxes in May 2009. At the same time, the budget is affected by larger-than-expected \nsomoni depreciation and adjustments in salaries and electricity tariffs. The resulting expenditure \nimpact is around TJS260 million. This will result in a fiscal deficit of TJS1.1 billion ($277 million, \nor  5.2%  of  GDP).  Under  this  scenario,  the  financing  requirement  will  be  TJS1.2  billion  ($311 \nmillion).  \n \n28. \nAs a response to the imminent fiscal threat, in May 2009 Parliament endorsed the crisis \nbudget  (column  2  of  Table  2)  amounting  to  TJS4,306  million  ($1,077  million),  which  includes \nadjusting  nondiscretionary  expenditures  to  reflect  changes  in  policy  toward  government  wage \nincreases,  maintaining  social  and \nreform-related  spending,  and  cutting  nonessential \nexpenditures.  Under  the  crisis  budget,  the  financing  requirement  is  TJS525  million  ($131 \nmillion).12  \n \n \n\n                                                 \n8  Action  Plan  on  Prevention  of  Financial  Crisis  in  the  Republic  of  Tajikistan,  Government  Resolution  No.  12.1\u201310,               \n\n31 December 2008. \n\n9   Government of Tajikistan.  2009.

Under  Tajikistan's  intergovernmental  fiscal \n30. \nframework, poor oblasts and raions13 receive subventions from the republican budget. The size \nof  the  transfers  is  based  on  the  difference  between  local  government  revenues  and  critical \nexpenditure needs, such as salaries and wages and pension contributions. The subventions are \nalso  important  for  maintaining  primary  and  secondary  health  services  and  general  education, \nwhich are financed by the local budget. During 2008, two of three oblasts and 10 of 13 raions \nunder  republican  supervision  received  fiscal  transfers  from  the  Government  amounting  to \nTJS181.6 million.  \n\n \n31. \nSocial  Protection.  The  government  social  protection  system  consists  of  social \ninsurance,  social  assistance,  and  employment  programs.  Under  social  insurance,  the \nGovernment provides labor pensions and family benefits (e.g., paid maternity leave). There are \napproximately  461,000  pensioners.  Pension  benefits  are  based  on  the  length  of  service  and \naverage earnings over a specified period. In July 2008, the Government increased the minimum \nmonthly pension from TJS20 to TJS60. However, due to revenue shortfalls, pension arrears are \ngrowing and amounted to TJS23 million in March 2009. \n\n \n32. \nSocial  assistance  includes  (i)  social  pensions,  which  are  paid  to  individuals  with  no \nemployment  record;  (ii)  cash  compensation  payments  for  children  from  poor  households  and \nthose  without  a  parent  or  both  parents;  (iii)  cash  compensation  or  subsidies  for  energy \nconsumption by poor households; and (iv) in-kind assistance, such as orthopedic products and \nsanatorium treatments.  \n \n33. \nThe employment program covers unemployment benefits, skills training, microcredit, and \npublic  works  programs.  Registered  unemployed  persons  receive  short-term  training  courses \nand/or microcredit for self-employment. Those unable to find employment following training can \nreceive  employment  benefits  for  up  to  6  months,  provided  they  have  a  recent  employment \nhistory. Specifically, individuals that have paid payroll tax for 18 months over the past 3 years \nare entitled to receive an unemployment allowance equivalent to 50% of their salary during that \nperiod.  The  public  works  program  includes  mainly  mini-hydropower  projects  and  small  road \nmaintenance. The components of the employment program and the number of beneficiaries are \nsummarized in Table 4. \n\nTable 4: Employment Program \n\n \nProgram \nUnemployment benefits \nSkills training  \nMicrocredit \nPublic works \n\nNumber of Beneficiaries   \nin 2008 \n3,022 \n8,080 \n2,865 \n7,488 \n         Source: Ministry of Labor and Social Protection of the Population. \n\n  \n \n34. \nIn  addition  to  prioritizing  these  social  protection  measures,  the  Government  is \nconsidering possible new projects based on assessments of the reverse migrant flows. These \nprojects, which are subject to adequate funding, would focus on creating self-employment and \nemployment  through  rural  finance,  new  training  centers  and  programs,  and  small-scale  public \nworks.   \n\n                                                 \n13 Poor oblasts and raions are those whose own revenues are insufficient to cover expenditures.  \n\n9\n\n \n\n\f \n\n10 \n \n\n Because  of  financing  constraints,  the  level  of  benefits  under  the  various  pillars  is \n35. \nextremely low. Furthermore, eligibility criteria and targeting need improvement. The MLSPP has \nembarked  on  a  comprehensive  reform  program  of  the  social  protection  system,  which  is \nsupported primarily by the European Commission. The reform program covers (i) a labor market \nand migrant strategy, (ii) targeting of social benefits and privileges, (iii) expansion and physical \nupgrading of care institutions, and (iv) institutional strengthening of relevant institutions. These \nreforms  will  contribute  significantly  to  improving  the  social  protection  and  safety  net  system  in \nthe medium term. \n \n36. \nUtilities  Expenses  for  Education,  Health  and  Social  Protection  Institutions.    The \nGovernment  has  recently  adopted  a  policy  of  gradual  increases  in  gas  and  electricity  tariffs. \nWhile crucial for improving the financial viability of the sector, tariff increases require significant \nadditional  resources.  Ensuring  sufficient  resources  for  utility  needs  is  essential  for  minimizing \ndisruption  in  service  delivery  of  public  schools,  health  facilities,  and  institutions  that  provide \nsocial assistance (e.g., orphanages).   \n\n \n\nE. \n\nADB Strategy and Assistance \n\n37. \nADB began operations in Tajikistan in 1998. Over the last 10 years, ADB has played an \nimportant  role  in  the  country's  reconstruction  and  development  efforts,  and  is  now  the  largest \nsource of development assistance after the People's Republic of China. In line with government \npriorities  and  development  needs,  the  2004\u20132008  country  strategy  and  program14 focused  on                        \n(i)  rural  development  through  private  sector  involvement,  institution-building,  and  improved \nirrigation;  and  (ii)  promoting  regional  cooperation  and  integration  through  improved  power \nsupply,  transport  infrastructure  and  cross-border  trade.  ADB  has  also  been  responsive  in \nhelping Tajikistan meet unexpected challenges. For example, the Khatlon Province Flood Risk \nProject15 (approved  in  2007)  aims  to  reduce  the  socioeconomic  impact  of  floods  and  address \nrecurring flood risks in the country\u2019s most flood-prone areas. \n \n38. \nThe  new  country  partnership  strategy  (CPS),  which  is  being  finalized,  will  continue  to \nfocus  on  pro-poor  growth,  and  takes  into  account  (i)  development  needs  and  implementation \ncapacity,  (ii)  other  development  partners'  assistance  and  ADB  comparative  advantage,  and              \n(iii) the need for a focused approach in view of limited ADF funds. ADB support during 2009\u2013\n2012  will  cover  transport  and  energy  sectors  and  private  sector  development  through  an \nimproved investment climate.  \n \nThe proposed program is included in the draft CPS, which underlines the program's role \n39. \nin  the  Government's  crisis  mitigation  efforts  as  well  as  in  supporting  the  overarching  CPS \nobjective of poverty reduction. \n \nF. \n\nGovernment Strategy \n\n40. \nThe  Government's  National  Development  Strategy  (NDS)  2007\u20132015  identifies  three \nmain priorities: (i) improvement of public administration; (ii) promotion of sustainable economic \ngrowth;  and  (ii)  human  development.  The  primary  goal  of  the  NDS  is  to  improve  the  living \nstandard of the population through economic growth and achievement of the MDGs.  \n \n\n                                                 \n14 ADB. 2003.

The  key  measures  identified  to  address  these  objectives \ninclude:  (i)  restructuring  of  the  social  welfare  system;  (ii)  strengthening  the  financial \nsustainability of the pension and social insurance system; (iii) establishing a methodology for the \nstudy, monitoring and regulation of the labor market and migration; (iv) improving the targeting \nand quality of social assistance programs; and (v) strengthening protection of children's rights.16 \n \n42. \nIn  line  with  the  lessons  from  implementation  of  PSRP  1,  PRSP  2  sought  to  introduce \nbetter  sequencing  and  prioritization  of  development  needs  and  reform  measures,  include  a \ncomprehensive \nto  enhance \nimplementation and outcomes.

Its  principal  outcome  will  be  the  provision  of  fiscal \nsupport and social safety nets. The counterpart funds generated from the program proceeds will \nact  as  a  cushion  against  Tajikistan\u2019s  revenue  shortfall,  and  will  be  utilized  to  support  the  key \ncountercyclical  expenditures  highlighted  in  Table  5.  The  program  will  specifically  help  ensure \nthat poor and vulnerable groups are protected through adequate safety net measures. The main \noutputs of the program will be: \n \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n\nimplementation of employment programs for returned and unemployed migrants; \nprovision of social assistance to vulnerable groups; and \nuninterrupted  service  delivery  by  health,  education  and  social  protection \ninstitutions. \n\n \nTo meet these objectives, the counterpart funds generated from program proceeds will \n44. \nbe  utilized  by  the  Government  in  meeting  its  general  and  overall  public  expenditure \nrequirements  during  fiscal  year  (FY)  2009.  Specifically,  among  other  needs,  the  Government \nhas agreed that it will utilize the counterpart funds generated from program proceeds in part to \nfund the crisis mitigation measures outlined in Table 5. The Government will establish a special \naccount  to  enable  full  monitoring  of  the  use  of  the  counterpart  proceeds.

After  exploring  different \n45. \noptions,  ADB's  program  lending  modality  was  chosen.  The  proposed  program  adopts  the \nprogram-based  approach 17  in  order  to  enable  a  swift  response,  with  two  principal  anchor \nprograms:  (i)  the  IMF's  Poverty  Reduction  and  Growth  Facility  (PRGF),  which  provides  the \noverall macroeconomic and reform umbrella; and (ii) the Government's crisis mitigation program, \nas outlined earlier.   \n \n46. \nmacroeconomic stability and providing adequate social safety nets, is in Appendix 4.  \n \n47. \nCriteria  for  Determining  the  Expenditure  Categories.  The  subcomponents  of  the \ncategories  of  expenditures  to  be  supported  under  the  program  are  based  on  the  following \ncriteria: \n \n\nThe  Government's  development  policy  letter,  outlining  its  commitment  to  restoring \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\npriorities identified by the Government; \nprotection for the poor and vulnerable, including migrant workers who have been \nforced to return; and \nthe ability to monitor and audit the use and allocation of resources.  \n\n \nC. \n\nPolicy Framework and Actions \n\n48. \nThe  Government  has  been  proactive  in  its  crisis  response.  In  November  2008,  the \nGovernment  established  the  ICMC,  which  is  responsible  for  formulating  and  implementing \nappropriate  monetary,  fiscal  and  financial  sector  policies,  as  well  as  for  strengthening  social \nprotection.  The  ICMC  has  developed  an  anti-crisis  action  plan,  which  is  being  implemented \n\n                                                 \n17  ADB. April 2009.

To  facilitate  external  adjustment  by \nstrengthening  export  competitiveness,  the  authorities  are  moving  towards  a  more  flexible \nexchange rate regime and will intervene in the foreign exchange market only to smooth excess \nvolatility as supported under the IMF program. To mitigate risks to the financial sector, NBT has \nintensified  banking  supervision  and  is  taking  steps  to  introduce  a  statutory  overnight  credit \nfacility, a 7-day deposit facility, and restrict other liquidity loans to a maturity of up to 3 months. \nNBT is also developing contingency plans with IMF assistance. The Government has revised its \n2009 budget.  \n \n49. \nOn  the  structural  reform  front,  the  Government  has  prioritized  measures  to  address \nvarious  weaknesses  that  were  highlighted  by  the  misreporting  episode  by  NBT  to  the  IMF. \nThese  measures  are  essential  to  improve  the  effectiveness  of  monetary  policy  and  financial \nsupervision, and reestablish the government's  credibility more generally. The Government has \nadopted a comprehensive action plan to implement recommendations of a special audit of NBT \nas part of prior actions for the IMF's PRGF, and has published the audit\u2019s executive summary in \nan  effort  to  enhance  transparency.  An  external  audit  of  NBT\u2019s  external  reserve  position  has \nbeen  completed,  and  external  auditors  of  NBT's  financial  statements  have  been  appointed,  in \nline  with  international  standards.  In  addition,  the  Government  has  submitted  to  Parliament \namendments  to  the  NBT  Law  and  Commercial  Banking  Law  to  strengthen  central  bank \nindependence and disclosure and to minimize conflicts of interest (Appendix 5). \n \n50. \n\nThe key features of the Government's program are summarized in Table 6. \n\n \nTable 6: Summary of the Government's Program\u2013Basis for ADB's Support \n\n \nI.

The  PRGF  approved  by  the  IMF  provides  the  macroeconomic  underpinnings  for  the \nprogram.    The  program  is  part  of  concerted  donor  effort  to  support  the  Government's  crisis \nmitigation efforts. To meet the balance-of-payments needs arising from the crisis, the IMF plans \nto disburse $70 million from the $116 million facility during 2009, subject to satisfactory program \nimplementation.  At  the  Government's  request,  the  World  Bank  doubled  the  budget  support \n\n \n\n\f \n\n14 \n \n\nunder  the  Third  Programmatic  Development  Policy  Grant  to  $20  million.  The  World  Bank \nprogram  was  approved  in  March  2009.  The  European  Commission  is  also  taking  steps  to \nprovide  funds  amounting  to  \u20ac17.5  million  in  2009  by  releasing  remaining  tranches  of  its  Food \nSecurity Programme and frontloading disbursement of its ongoing Social Protection Project and \nGlobal Food Facility. The Development Partners Matrix is in Appendix 6. \n \n52. \nUse of the Program-Based Approach and Full Alignment with Government's Crisis \nMitigation  Plan.  The  program  was  prepared  in  response  to  the  Government's  urgent  request \nfor countercyclical fiscal support, is fully in line with the Government's own crisis mitigation plan, \nand is an integral part of its financing plan. \n \n53.  \nProvision  of  Urgent  Fiscal  Stimulus  Support.  The  program  will  provide  budget \nsupport  to  enable  the  Government  to  expediently  meet  critical  expenditure  needs.  The  ADB \nteam considered various factors before proposing the public expenditure support option. \n \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\nRegardless of the modality, the country needs resources to adopt countercyclical \nfiscal  policies.  Within  ADB's  program-lending  modality,  financing  support  needs \nto  be  linked  as  closely  as  possible  with  supported  reforms.  In  Tajikistan,  as  in \nmany  other  countries,  the  shocks  associated  with  the  global  financial  crisis  are \nexogenous,  although  certain  structural  weaknesses  may  have  aggravated  their \nimpact. The circumstances make it difficult to formulate policy measures that deal \ndirectly with the crisis and that require resources to implement. A key area with \nstructural  weaknesses  relates  to  the  monetary  and  financial  sectors.  Improving \ngovernance  of  the  NBT  is  a  key  priority,  which  is  being  addressed  in  the  IMF \nprogram. \n\nThe Government's efforts during this time of crisis are focused on mitigation and \nsocial protection. While some commitment to policy and institutional reforms may \nremain, human resources are likely to be stretched. Moreover, it is desirable that \nthe  transaction  costs  of  any  support  provided  by  donors  be  kept  as  small  as \npossible.  In  this  regard,  the  team  considered  several  possible  reform  areas\u2014 \nincluding the cotton sector, education and health, and finance\u2014where ADB has \nhad prior engagement. Cotton sector reforms are likely to take considerable time, \nand  require  resources  that  are  clearly  earmarked  for  such  reforms.  Key  reform \npriorities  in  finance  are  associated  with  the  NBT.  The  education  and  health \nsectors  need  urgent  financing  to  ensure  that  recurrent  needs  are  met  and  that \npriority development needs are not neglected. \n\nADB  should  add  value  through  its  support.  The  proposed  public  expenditure \noption  accomplished \nrestore \nmacroeconomic stability and continue structural reforms (as supported under the \nIMF PRGF).  \n\nreinforcing  key  measures \n\nthis  while \n\nto \n\n \nE. \n\nFinancing Plan   \n\n54. \nThe  Government  has  requested  a  grant  of  $40  million  from  ADB's  Special  Funds \nresources.

The main \n\n55. \nimplementing agencies will be MOF and MLSPP.   \n \n56. \nProcurement  and  Withdrawal  Procedures.  Grant  proceeds  will  be  used  to  pay  for \nitems procured in ADB member countries, other than the items specified in the list of ineligible \nitems  (Appendix  9)  and  imports  financed  by  other  bilateral  and  multilateral  sources.  The \nproceeds  of  the  program  grant  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s \nsimplification of disbursement procedures and related requirements for program grants.18 Grant \nproceeds  disbursed  against  imports  will  require  a  certificate  from  the  Government  stipulating \nthat  the  value  of  the  total  imports  of  Tajikistan,  minus  its  imports  from  nonmember  countries, \nineligible imports, and imports financed under other official development assistance, is equal to \nor greater than the amount of the grant expected to be disbursed during a particular year. ADB \nreserves the right to audit the use of grant proceeds to verify the accuracy of the Government\u2019s \ncertification. \n \n57. \nThe Recipient will establish a subaccount in the Treasury Single Account (referred to as \nthe  special  account)  with  NBT.  Counterpart  funds  will  be  generated  by  converting  the  grant \nproceeds to somoni using the official exchange rate, and such counterpart funds will be credited \ninto  the  special  account.  The  crediting  of  the  special  account  will  be  done  within  5  days  from \ngrant  disbursement.  NBT  will  provide  ADB  with  official  notification  that  the  counterpart  funds \ngenerated  from  the  grant  proceeds  have  been  credited  to  the  special  account  (including  the \namount of foreign currency converted, the date of conversion to somoni, the official exchange \nrate,  date  of  deposit,  name  and  number  of  the  special  account,  and  the  deposited  somoni \namount).  MOF  will  be  responsible  for  maintaining  the  special  account.  The  Government  will \nensure that the counterpart funds generated are used primarily to fund the budget expenditures \nsupported  by  the  program  (Table  5)  and  are  in  full  compliance  with  the  Government\u2019s  public \n                                                 \n18 ADB. 1998.

Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance, \naccountability,  and  transparency,  ADB  reserves  the  right  to  investigate,  directly  or  through  its \nagents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the program. \nTo support these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the \napplicable grant regulations and the bidding documents.  \n \n60. \nThe  Government  acknowledges  that  ADB,  consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good \ngovernance,  accountability,  and  transparency,  reserves  the  right  to  undertake,  directly  or \nthrough  its  agents,  investigation  of  any  possible  financial  or  management  impropriety  in  the \nconduct  of  the  program.  The  Government  will  cooperate  fully  and  ensure  that  each  of  its \nagencies  cooperates  with  any  such  investigation  and  extends  all  necessary  assistance, \nincluding access to relevant books and records. \n \n61. \nADB retains the right to audit the use of grant proceeds and to verify the accuracy of the \nGovernment\u2019s  certification  for  withdrawal  applications.  Before  withdrawal,  the  Government  will \nopen or nominate a deposit account at the NBT to receive all grant proceeds. The account will \nbe managed, operated, and liquidated in accordance with terms satisfactory to ADB.  \n \n62. \nThe  Public  Expenditure  and  Financial  Accountability  (PEFA)  Assessment  completed  in \nMay  2007  highlighted  a  number  of  risks,  particularly  in  predictability  and  control  in  budget \nexecution,  accounting,  recording  and  reporting,  and  external  audit.19 Efforts  to  address  these \nweaknesses are ongoing. The budget systems are being reformed in order to make them more \nreliable and output-oriented. Treasury systems are being automated and quarterly reporting of \nbudget  execution  has  been  institutionalized.  Accounting  reforms,  including  strengthening  of \nlegislation  and  regulations,  are  also  ongoing.  In  March  2009,  the  Government  adopted  the \nPublic  Finance  Management  Strategy  2009\u20132018  through  Presidential  Decree  #542.  The \nDecree sets a quantitative target of improving the PEFA score by more than 50% by 2018. This \nwill triple the number of indicators with a score of A and B, and halve the number of indicators \nthat score C and D. The European Commission is supporting the implementation of this strategy, \nwith a particular focus on internal control.

The World Bank is supporting the implementation of the new Law on Procurement \n(2006). Under the World Bank technical assistance, staff of the public procurement agency and \nsix entities\u2014the ministries of education, health, justice, industry and energy, agriculture, and the \nState Committee for Investment\u2014have been trained and accredited. The World Bank has also \nrecently approved a project (co-financed with Department for International Development [DFID] \nof the United Kingdom, European Commission, and Government of Japan) aimed at operational \nand technological improvements in public financial management (Appendix 7). \n \nThe Government has shown its commitment, as noted in PEFA as well as through the \n63. \nnew strategy, but reforms and capacity building in this area are long-term undertakings. Given \nthe risks and concerns involved, the program will specifically focus on the following:20 \n \n\nmonitoring  of  general  budget  execution,  to  guide  implementation  of  the  Public \nFinance Management Strategy during 2009\u20132010; \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n \n\n(iii) \n\n \n(iv) \n \n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nmonitoring of program-supported expenditures, including specifically: \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n(c) \n\nintergovernmental  fiscal  transfers  from  the  republican  to  local  budget \naccounts, 21  to  properly  account  for  the  subventions  to  poor  regions; \ncomplete budget execution reports will be needed at both republican and \nlocal levels; \nexpenditures by education, health and social protection institutions; and \nfinancial flows and bank accounts related to regular and special safety net \nprograms. This will include the Social Protection Fund and other ad hoc, \ncrisis-related  implementation  arrangements  (e.g.,  for  the  employment \nprogram)  in  order  to  ensure  timely  delivery  of  stimulus  support  on  the \nground, among other factors;   \n\n \nexpenditure reconciliation, to produce account reconciliation reports for program-\nsupported  expenditures,  and  monitor  compliance  with  rules  for  processing  and \nrecording transactions; \n\ninternal controls and audits for program-supported expenditures; \n\nmonitoring  of  procurement  or  contracting  of  services  related  to  program-\nsupported expenditures and programs; and \n\n \n\nestablishment  of  a  complaints  mechanism \nprocurement undertaken for program-supported expenditures. \n\nfor  beneficiary  selection  and \n\n \nA  small  team  comprising  one  financial  management  specialist  (12  person-months)  and \n64. \none  procurement  specialist  (4  person-months)  will  be  engaged  to  closely  work  with  the \n                                                 \n20 This  will  be  done  through  a  regional  technical  assistance  (RETA)  that  is  currently  being  processed.  With  crisis \nrecovery support programs being planned in Armenia, Georgia and Tajikistan, a RETA will help across the region \nin  public  expenditure  monitoring.  The  RETA  will  be  considered  by  the  Board  together  with  the  three  crisis \nprograms.  \n\n21 Tajikistan has a partial treasury single account that is currently in operation. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n18 \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n\n(iii) \n\n \n68. \n \n\nGovernment to effectively execute its crisis budget.22 ADB's support will be closely coordinated \nwith the World Bank and European Commission, as both have budget support operations and \nare providing assistance for public financial management reforms.  \n \nI. \n\nPerformance Monitoring and Evaluation  \n\n65.  Within  1  month  of  program  effectiveness,  the  MOF,  implementing  agencies,  and  ADB \nwill  establish  a  performance  evaluation  system  based  on  the  program  design  and  monitoring \nframework.  The  framework  will  be  closely  linked  with  the  regional  technical  assistance              \n(footnote 20). ADB will also coordinate with all relevant development partners in monitoring and \nevaluating program performance. \n \n\nIV. \n\nBENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\n66. \nBenefits. Without the program, the Government would be unable to take countercyclical \nfiscal measures. Consequently, the program will increase the Government's capacity to mitigate \nthe  adverse  impacts  of  the  crisis  through  appropriate  fiscal  policies  and  social  protection \nprograms.  The  program  will  help  reduce  the  incidence  of  poverty  and  restore  growth.  The \nimmediate beneficiaries will be the poor and vulnerable groups who are hardest hit by the crisis.  \n \n67. \n \n\nSpecific benefits and beneficiaries will include: \n\nEmployment  program.  Implementation  of  the  Government's  employment \nprogram  will  help  create  employment  opportunities  for  return  migrants  through \nskills retraining, microfinance, and public works programs. \nSocial  assistance  programs.  The  Government's  social  assistance  program \nincludes  a  range  of  benefits  and  services  such  as  social  pensions,  cash \ncompensations  payments  for  children  from  poor  households  and  those  lacking \nfor  energy \none  or  both  parents,  and  cash  compensation  or  subsidies \nconsumption by poor households. Social pensions are paid to individuals with no \nemployment  record.  Social  assistance  also  includes  in-kind  assistance  such  as \northopedic products and sanatorium treatments. \nFood,  utilities  and  medicine  for  health,  education  and  social  protection \ninstitutions. Adequate funding of food and utility expenditures will help minimize \nservice delivery disruption in public schools, health facilities, and institutions that \nprovide  social  assistance  (e.g.,  orphanages).  In  addition,  budget  allocations  for \nmedicines  provided  by  the  central  Government  are  protected,  which  prevents \ndisruption in the delivery of health services.   \n\nRisks. There are some downside risks to the program.  \n\nThe  global  downturn  could  be  more  protracted  than  anticipated.  In  particular, \ncontinuing  downgrading  of \nthe  Russian  Federation  and \nKazakhstan will result in more severe impacts on Tajikistan\u2019s economy.  \n\nthe  outlook \n\nfor \n\nRising uncertainty and competing needs and priorities could slow an appropriate \npolicy response. The Government has thus far been proactive in its stabilization \nand countercyclical efforts, but the downside risks need to be carefully monitored. \nThe authorities have also intensified regional policy dialogue to better assess the \n\n                                                 \n22   This will be supported under a regional technical assistance (footnote 20). \n\n\f \n\n \n(iii) \n\nimpact of the crisis, and to learn from the experience of neighboring countries in \ncrisis  management.  Development  partners  have  likewise  responded  with  policy \nadvice and financial assistance. \n\nPoor  design  and  weak  fiduciary  controls  may  hamper  the  efficacy  of  the  crisis \nmitigation  plans.  The  program\u2019s  proposed  design  is  fairly  straightforward,  and \ninvolves no complex targeting or identification of beneficiaries. ADB will work with \nthe  Government,  in  collaboration  with  the  other  development  partners,  in \nadhering  to  good  financial  management  practices  in  executing  the  crisis \nmitigation program.     \n\n \n69. \nImpacts. The program is classified as environmental category C.  It is not expected to \ngenerate  adverse  environmental  impacts  requiring  mitigating  measures.  No  involuntary \nresettlement  or  indigenous  peoples  impacts  are  expected  from  program  implementation.  A \nsummary poverty reduction and social strategy is in Appendix 8.  \n \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nIn addition to the standard assurances, the Government has given the following specific \n\n70. \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nthe \n\nimpact  of \n\nthe  global \n\nThe Government will work with ADB (and other development partners) to monitor \nresults, track the flow of donor assistance, and assess the impact of support for \nthe crisis mitigation plan. \nThe Government shall update ADB on the implementation of the crisis mitigation \nprogram  and  ensure  that  necessary  support  is  provided  to  ADB  to  review  and \nmonitor the status of key indicators under the design and monitoring framework.  \nThe Government will ensure that the counterpart funds generated from the grant \nproceeds  are  used  for  financing  its  immediate  budgetary  expenditures  arising \nfrom \nfinancial  crisis  and  essential  budgetary \nexpenditures  incurred  to  sustain  delivery  of  the  Government\u2019s  core  publicly \nfunded  program,  in  compliance  with  its  public  finance  management  procedures \nand  reporting  arrangements,  and  that  such  proceeds  are  not  used  to  finance \nineligible items as set forth in Appendix 9, and shall provide a certificate to ADB \nto this effect. \nThe  Government  will,  in  particular,  provide  necessary  budget  appropriations  to \nallow withdrawals from the Special Account in support of (a) subventions to poor \nregions  (local  governments),  (b)  employment  program,  (c)  social  assistance,             \n(d)  utility,  food,  medicine  and  telecommunications  expenditures  in  education, \nhealth  and  social  protection  under  the  republican  budget,  and  (e)  other  priority \nsocial safety net measures and activities of the crisis mitigation plan implemented \nby the Recipient satisfactory to ADB.

Poverty\u2014defined  as \nthe share of the population living on $2.15 per day or less\u2014declined from 82% in 1998 to \n53%  in  2007.  As  is  true  of  other  Central  Asian  countries,  Tajikistan's  social  indicators  are \nrelatively  good  for  its  per  capita  income  level,  reflecting  the  country\u2019s  already  level  of  high \nhuman  development  at  the  time  of  independence.  Tajikistan  inherited  high  primary  school \nattendance  rates  (the  net  primary  school  enrollment  rate  was  97.5%  in  2005),  and  has  set  a \ntarget of achieving universal secondary school enrolment by 2015. Infant mortality per 1,000 live \nbirths was 59 in 2005, but the maternal mortality ratio remains very high.   \n \n\nTable A2.1: Education and Health Indicators \n\nSocial Sector Budget \n\n1995 \n\u2014 \n90 \n120 \n\n1990 \n76.70 \n91 \n130 \n\n2000 \n96.70 \n75 \n100 \n\n2005 \n97.50 \n59 \n170 \n\nItem \nNet School Enrollment Rate (%) \nInfant Mortality per 1,000 live births \nMaternal mortality per 100,000 live births \n\u2014 = not available. \nSource: Asian Development Bank Poverty Database. \n \n2. \nWhile  progress  has  been  made  in  education,  the  health  sector  continues  to  be  under-\nfinanced by both government and donors, and attainment of Millennium Development Goals 4 \nand 5 (reduction by 2015 of the infant mortality and maternal mortality ratios by two thirds from \ntheir 1990 levels) will be difficult.  \n \nB. \n \n3. \nTajikistan's state budget consists of the republican budget, local budget, and the social \nprotection fund, all three of which support public expenditure for social protection. Pension and \nother  social  insurance  benefits  (e.g.,  unemployment  benefits  for  6  months,  disability  and \nmaternity allowances) for those who have contributed to the social protection fund are covered \nby the fund, with non-contributors covered by the republican and local budgets. Expenditures for \nthe  education  and  health  sectors  are  supported  by  the  republican  and  local  budgets,  with \ngeneral  education  and  primary  and  secondary  health  services  financed  by  the  local  budget, \nwhile higher education and tertiary health services are financed by the republican budget.  \n \n4. \nThe  education  and  health  sector  involves  a  large  network  of  service  delivery \ninfrastructure  and  personnel.  The  education  sector  has  about  4,500  education  and  research \ninstitutions  with  almost  2  million  students.  The  health  sector  has  about  3,550  health  facilities, \ncatering  to  inpatient  and  outpatient  services  for  the  entire  population  of  Tajikistan,  and \npreventive services that include (most importantly) immunization for children.  \n \nIn  2008  the  education sector's share  of  total state  expenditures  was  14.3%,  the  health \n5. \nsector  5.1%,  and  the  social  protection  sector  9.6%.  Spending  in  the  education  and  health \nsectors  was  slightly  less  (97%)  than  planned  in  the  budget,  while  spending  in  the  social \nprotection sector exceeded (102%) than planned in the budget. Similarly, in 2005\u20132006, budget \nexecution in the three social sectors was high (above 97%).  \n \n\n \n\n\f     Appendix 2 \n\n24 \n \n\nPayments  by  local  governments  for  teachers  and  health  workers  are  delayed  and \n6. \ndoctors' salaries are reported to have been affected in some cases this year due to the financial \ncrisis. The health sector budget cut made prior to approval of the crisis budget in May 2009 has \neven affected transportation of vaccines, which is usually accorded a high priority.  \n \n\nTable A2.2: 2008 State Budget Execution in the Social Sectors \n \n\n \nSector \nEducation \nHealth \nSocial Protection \nTotal \nSource: Ministry of Finance.  \n\nPlanned Budget \n(TJS) \n744,234,528 \n267,357,670 \n474,441,104 \n5,179,056,682 \n\nC. \n\nThe Local Budget \n\n \n\nActual Spending \n(TJS) \n722,318,886 \n259,493,662 \n485,796,384 \n5,057,973,322 \n\nBudget Execution \n(%) \n\n97.1 \n97.1 \n102.4 \n97.7 \n\n7. \nThe  gap  between  the  budgetary  requirements  of  local  governments  and  revenue  is \nfinanced by the republican budget. During 2008, two of three oblasts and 10 of 13 raions under \nrepublican  supervision  received  fiscal  transfers  from  the  Government  amounting  to  TJS181.6 \nmillion.  The  subventions  are  especially  important  to  maintain  primary  and  secondary  health \nservices, and general education, which are financed by the local budget. The actual spending \nagainst the agreed budget is audited annually.  \n \nGeneral  education  financing  is  gradually  moving  towards  per  capita  payment,  with  the \n8. \ntransition  expected  to  be  completed  in  2010,  while  per  capita  financing  of  primary  health \nservices  is  being  piloted  in  just  a  few  raions.  The  local  budget  still  shows  indicative  item-wise \nbudgets  for  both  sectors,  however.  Personnel  costs  (salary  and  social  security  contributions) \naccount for about 75% of the total local education and health budget, while less than 20% of the \n2009 social protection budget is allocated to personnel costs.  \n \nD. \n\nSocial Protection Programs \n\n9. \nThe  Government\u2019s  social  protection  system  consists  of  social  insurance,  social \nassistance, and employment programs. Under social insurance, the Government provides labor \npensions  and  family  benefits  (e.g.,  paid  maternity  leave).  There  are  461,401  pensioners. \nPension  benefits  are  based  on  the  length  of  service  and  average  earnings  over  a  specified \nperiod.  In  July  2008,  the  Government  increased  the  minimum  monthly  pension  from  TJS20  to \nTJS60. However, due to revenue shortfalls, pension arrears are growing and equaled to TJS23 \nmillion in March 2009. \n\n \n10. \nSocial assistance comprises social pensions, cash compensations payments for children \nfrom  poor  households  and  those  lacking  one  or  both  parents,  and  cash  compensation  or \nsubsidies for energy consumption by poor households. Social pensions are paid to individuals \nwith  no  employment  record.  Social  assistance  also  includes  in-kind  assistance  such  as \northopedic  products  and  sanatorium  treatments.  Excluding  payments  for  labor  pensions  and \nbenefits  to  the  military,  compensation  and  assistance  to  vulnerable  groups  is  around              \nTJS151.7  million.  Of  this,  the  original  2009  budget  allocates  around  TJS7.3  million  for  the \nemployment program. Table A2.3 lists the various compensation and assistance schemes and \ntheir allotments under the original 2009 budget.

Registered  unemployed  persons  receive  short-term  training  courses \nand/or microcredit for self-employment. Those unable to find employment following training can \nreceive  employment  benefits  for  up  to  6  months  provided  they  have  a  recent  employment \nhistory. Specifically, individuals that have paid payroll tax for 18 months over the past 3 years \nare entitled to receive an unemployment allowance equivalent to 50% of their salary during that \nperiod.

For example, in 2005, the biggest expenditure item was subsidies for gas \nand electricity expenses for \"privileged populations\" (including about 40 categories, according to \na  government  official).  The  regulations  for  this  program  were  revised  in  May  2008  to  limit  the \nsubsidy to 20% of households (which are supposed to be poor), triggered by gas and electricity \ntariffs  increases.  But  privilege-based  subsidies  for  various  items  remain,  including  telephone \nservice and housing rental. \n \n \nBecause  of  financing  constraints,  the  level  of  benefits  is  extremely  low.  Furthermore, \n13. \neligibility  criteria  and  targeting  will  be  needed  to  improve  the  effectiveness  of  the  social \nallowances and services provided. The Ministry of Labor and Social Protection of the Population \nhas  embarked  on  a  comprehensive  medium-term  reform  program  of  the  social  protection \nsystem,  primarily  with  support  from  the  European  Commission.  The  reform  program  covers             \n(i)  labor  market  and  migrant  strategy,  (ii)  targeting  of  social  benefits  and  privileges,                        \n(iii) expansion and physical upgrading of care institutions, and (iv) institutional strengthening of \nrelevant agencies. These reforms will contribute significantly to improving the social protection \nand safety net systems in the medium term. \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f     Appendix 3 \n\n28 \n \n\nTAX STRUCTURE \n\n \n1. \nThere are 15 state taxes and four local taxes in Tajikistan. The value-added tax (VAT) \naccounts for more than half of total tax collections (Tables A3.1 and A3.2). A large part of VAT \ncollection is from imports. The second tier of taxes (in term of share of total tax collections) are \nthe  income  and  profit  taxes  (13%  of  tax  revenues)  and  social  taxes  (11%  of  tax  revenues). \nSocial  taxes  are  not  general  revenue,  as  they  accrue  to  the  Social  Protection  Fund.  The \nimportance of the VAT in terms of tax revenues and the large differential between the VAT and \nthe  second  tier  taxes  may  be  attributed  to  the  heavy  dependence  of  Tajikistan\u2019s  economy  on \nmigrant  worker  remittances.  Remittances  fuel  consumption  spending,  which  includes  a  large \nproportion of imported goods. Coverage of remittance inflows by direct taxes\u2014such as income, \nprofit  and  social  taxes\u2014is  poor.  VAT\u2019s  share  of  tax  revenues  is  also  high  because  of  the \nrelatively high VAT rate. Sales taxes are levied on key commodities like cotton fibers (10% rate) \nand  aluminum  (3%).  Together  with  the  retail  sales  tax  accruing  to  local  governments,  these \nindirect taxes account for about 4.6% of total revenues.

Taxation in Tajikistan is governed by the Tax Code, Customs Code \n2. \nand  Law  on  Customs  Tariff.  Administration  of  both  state  and  local  internal  taxes  is  under  the \npurview  of  the  Tax  Committee,  while  customs  duties,  VAT,  and  excise  taxes  on  imports  are \ncollected  by  a  separate  customs  service.  There  have  been  limited  reforms  in  the  tax  system, \nincluding  the  introduction  of  the  Large  Taxpayers  Inspectorate  (LTI).  With  donor-support, \nfunctional reorganization has been undertaken in the LTI. The adoption of the new tax code in \n2005 was one attempt to reform taxation but it is hampered by implementation gaps as well as \nsome subsequent amendments. \n \n3. \nTax  administration  is  governed  by  a  regionalized  structure.  Excluding  large  taxpayer \npayments (which fall under the LTI), state and local taxes are administered regionally by the Tax \nCommittee  through  its  city,  oblast  and  raion  offices.  While  the  Tax  Committee  is  ultimately \nresponsible  for  tax  administration,  city,  oblast  and  raion  offices  operate  like  independent  tax \nadministrations. Taxpayers are required to register and pay taxes to their regional administration. \nThere  is  no  central  registry  of  taxpayers,  meaning  taxpayers  operating  across  several  regions \nmust  register  in  each  region,  obtain  distinct  tax  identification  numbers,  and  pay  taxes  to  each \nregional administration according to their activity in that region. Further, reporting lines between \nthe different levels of tax authority are muddied by the regular interference of local government \nofficials, because state tax authorities also collect local taxes, which are deposited in the local \ngovernment's accounts. \n \n4. \nThe  tax  collection  system  in  Tajikistan  is  largely  paper-based,  with  the  exception  of \nsome government and donor-supported initiatives to introduce limited automation. For instance, \nsoftware  for  VAT  collection  has  been  developed  to  track  VAT  invoices.  However,  due  to \nresource constraints, this has been implemented in only six of 68 inspectorates. Likewise, the \nLTI has developed its own system, but much remains to be improved. \n \n5. \nProspects for 2009. Between 2006 and 2008, tax revenues have on average increased \nby about 44%. However, the economic slowdown and reduced migrant remittances in 2009 are \nexpected to significantly affect tax revenues. From January to April 2009, actual tax collections \nwere 16.7% below the target. In May 2009, rates for the VAT were reduced from 20% to 18%, \nand for the profit tax from 25% to 15%. The Government anticipates a shortfall in tax revenues \nof  TJS551.3  million  (equivalent  to  13%  of  original  budget  estimates)  for  2009.  Tax  revenue \ngrowth (formerly forecast at 30% for 2009) has been sharply reduced to 13%, significantly below \nthe prior years' average. VAT collection is expected to fall short by nearly TJS380 million due to \nweak consumer spending. The crisis will cause personal income and corporate profits to decline, \nand income and profit tax collection forecasts have been revised downward by TJS86.2 million. \nThe  economic  slowdown  will  also  discourage  imports,  and  this  will  likely  reduce  revenue  from \ncustoms  duties  and  excise  taxes  on  foreign  goods.  Similarly,  low  commodity  prices  for  cotton \nand aluminum are expected to reduce the sales tax collected from sales of these commodities. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f     Appendix 3 \n\n30 \n \n\nTable A3.3: 2009 Tax Revenue (Original vs. Revised Budgets) \n(TJS million) \n\nItem \nTax Revenues \nIncome and Profit Tax \nSocial Tax \nProperty and Land Tax \nRetail and VAT \n   Retail \n   VAT \n   Simplified Tax \nExcise \nCustoms and Duties \nOther Domestic Taxes on Goods and Services \n\nOriginal \n4,270.2 \n652.9 \n471.5 \n166.2 \n2,370.6 \n169.4 \n2,180.6 \n20.6 \n169.2 \n247.1 \n192.8 \n\n (  ) = negative, VAT = value-added tax. \n Source: Government of Tajikistan, Ministry of Finance. \n \n\n \n\n \nItem \nTax Revenues \nIncome and Profit Tax \nSocial Tax \nProperty and Land Tax \nRetail and VAT \n   Retail \n   VAT \n   Simplified Tax \nExcise \nCustoms and Duties \nOther Domestic Taxes on Goods and Services \n \nTax Revenue/GDP \n\n \n2007 \n48.2 \n57.4 \n33.4 \n20.5 \n51.3 \n22.5 \n54.7 \n49.9 \n56.4 \n55.6 \n39.7 \n \n17.9 \n\nRevised \n3,718.9 \n567.4 \n471.5 \n166.2 \n1,972.0 \n150.7 \n1,800.7 \n20.6 \n158.7 \n217.1 \n166.0 \n\nChange \n(551.3) \n(85.5) \n0.0 \n0.0 \n(398.6) \n(18.8) \n(379.8) \n\n\u2013 \n(10.4) \n(30.0) \n(26.7) \n\n% Change \n(12.9) \n(13.1) \n0.0 \n0.0 \n(16.8) \n(11.1) \n(17.4) \n0.0 \n(6.2) \n(12.1) \n(13.9) \n\n \n2008 \n44.0 \n48.4 \n37.7 \n31.5 \n45.3 \n6.8 \n48.1 \n141.7 \n39.9 \n61.4 \n25.9 \n \n18.7 \n\n2009 \n\nOriginal \n29.7 \n44.2 \n35.5 \n37.0 \n27.6 \n48.0 \n26.5 \n       (1.0) \n13.8 \n16.9 \n27.5 \n \n20.6 \n\nRevised \n13.0 \n25.3 \n35.5 \n37.0 \n6.1 \n31.6 \n4.5 \n(1.0) \n6.8 \n2.7 \n9.8 \n \n19.5 \n\nTable A3.4: Tax Revenue Growth \n(%) \n\n (  ) = negative, GDP = gross domestic product, VAT = value-added tax. \nSource: Government of Tajikistan, Ministry of Finance. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\nAppendix 4 \n\n31\n\nLETTER OF DEVELOPMENT POLICY  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n32 \n \n\nAppendix 4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 4 \n\n33\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n34 \n \n\nAppendix 4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 4 \n\n35\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n36 \n \n\nAppendix 4 \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 4 \n\n37\n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 4 \n\n \n\n38 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nAppendix 4 \n\n39\n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n40 \n \n\nAppendix 4 \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\nAppendix 4 \n\n41\n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 4 \n\n \n\n42 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 4 \n\n43\n\n \n\n\f \n\n44 \n \n\nAppendix 5 \n\nInternational Monetary Fund's Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility, 2009\u20132012 \n\nBackground  \n\nPRGF Objectives and Actions \n\n \nA. \n \nBetween  2004  and  2008,  the  National  Bank  of  Tajikistan  (NBT)  provided  guarantees \n1. \ntotaling $77 million of loans from international financial institutions to secure credit lines for Tajik \ncompanies (primarily a company called Kredit Invest) to fund investment in the cotton sector in \nTajikistan. NBT also pledged its assets to secure loans totaling $241 million from international \nfinancial institutions. The Government or the NBT did not appropriately report these guarantees \nand  pledges  to  the  International  Monetary  Fund  (IMF).  The  uncovering  of  the  misreporting \nepisode to the IMF seriously undermined NBT's credibility. In response, the IMF required early \nrepayment of three non-complying disbursements (SDR29.4 million) made during the previous \nPoverty  Reduction  and  Growth  Facility  (PRGF).  At  the  same  time,  it  put  in  place  a  Staff \nMonitored  Program  (SMP)  focusing  on  NBT  governance  to  restore  credibility  and  to  resume \nmacroeconomic and structural reforms. \n \nB. \n \n2. \nFollowing  the  successful  implementation  of  the  SMP,  the  IMF  approved  a  new  3-year \nPRGF  in  April  2009.    Through  this  facility,  the  IMF  has  disbursed  $39  million,  and  plans  to \ndisburse  an  additional  $30  million  during  2009,  subject  to  satisfactory  progress  in  program \nimplementation.  The total PRGF amount is $116 million. \n \n3. \nThe  PRGF  provides  the  overall  framework  for  macroeconomic  policies  and  structural \nreforms.  Key  macroeconomic  policy  priorities  include:  (i)  gradual  and  orderly  exchange  rate \ndepreciation  to  facilitate  external  adjustment,  (ii)  appropriate  monetary  policy  to  contain  any \ninflationary  pressures  associated  with  currency  depreciation,  (iii)  appropriate  fiscal  policies  in \nview  of  revenue  shortfalls  and  need  for  increased  social  spending,  and  (iv)  improved  banking \nsupervision and contingency plans. \n \n4. \nStructural  reforms  will  focus  on  (i)  strengthening  governance  in  NBT,  (ii)  improving  tax \ncode and tax administration, (iii) improving operational and financial management of large state-\nowned enterprises (SOEs), and (iv) resolving cotton sector debt.   \n \n\nTable A5: Prior Actions, Structural Performance Criteria, \nand Structural Benchmarks for 2009 \n\nItem \n \nPrior Actions  \nAdopt a comprehensive and time-bound action plan to address all issues  \nand recommendations raised in the report on the special audit of the NBT, \nto be agreed with Fund staff. \n \nPublish the executive summary of the report on the findings of the special \naudit of the NBT (http://nbt.tj/en/files/docs/annual_report/rep_eng.pdf). \n \nComplete external audit of the NBT's net international reserves position as \nof 31 December 2008 and share the audit report with Fund staff.  \n \nAppoint an external auditor to audit the NBT's financial statements for the  \nfiscal year ending 30 April 2009.  \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nStatus \n\nCompleted \n\nCompleted \n\nCompleted \n\nCompleted \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 5 \n\n45\n\nStatus \n\n \n\nCompleted \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nItem \n \nSubmit to Parliament amendments to NBT and Commercial Banking Laws to: \n(i) appoint the NBT chairperson and his/her deputies for fixed terms that do  \nnot coincide with the electoral cycle, and outline the reasons for their \ndismissal explicitly in the law;

It  uses  an  indicator-based  approach  covering  31  indicators \ncategorized  into  seven  groups:  (i)  credibility  of  the  budget;  (ii) comprehensiveness  and \ntransparency;  (iii)  policy-based  budgeting;  (iv)  predictability  and  control  in  budget  execution; \n(v) accounting,  recording,  and  reporting;  (vi)  external  scrutiny  and  audit;  and  (vii)  donor \npractices. The PEFA rating employs a framework that ranks public financial management (PFM) \nattributes  on  a  four-grade  scale  from  \u201cA\u201d  to  \u201cD\u201d,  measuring  against  standard  operational \nperformance benchmarks. A rating of \u201cA\u201d indicates international best practice, and a rating of \u201cB\u201d \nimplies good achievement. Ratings of \u201cC\u201d and \u201cD\u201d suggest the need for improvement. \n \n2. \nThe  2007  PEFA  assessment  identifies  weaknesses  in  PFM  in  Tajikistan.  Of  the  30 \nindicators, only two have ratings of \"A\" and four ratings of \"B\". The major weaknesses are in key \nstages of the budget cycle, such as budget execution, accounting and audit.  \n\n \nTable A7.1: Public Expenditure and Accountability Assessment \n \n\nRating \n\nIssue covered \n\nAggregate expenditure outturn \nComposition of expenditure outturn \nAggregate revenue outturn \nStock and monitoring of expenditure payment arrears \n\nIndicator \nA.

The  PEFA  assessment  gave  positive  ratings  for  aggregate \nrevenue and expenditures. Revenue estimates were consistently exceeded, and this contributed \nto the higher-than-planned expenditures, which were kept within 15% of planned expenditures. \nHowever,  the  PEFA  assessment  noted  that  there  was  a  need  to  increase  transparency  in  the \nallocation  of  the  unplanned  revenues,  because  supplementary  budgets  funded  by  the  excess \nrevenues  did  not  follow  proper  procedures.  The  assessment  also  found  that  significant \nreallocation within the budget occurred, which compromises budget credibility. Finally, the PEFA \nassessment found that the absence of a commitment control system weakened the monitoring \nof expenditure arrears. \n \n4. \nComprehensiveness  and  Transparency.  Budget  documentation  was  found  to  be \ncomprehensive and intergovernmental fiscal transfers were assessed as transparent. However, \nother  indicators  fared  poorly.  The  budget  classification,  while  following  the  International \nMonetary Fund's 1986 Government Finance Statistics Manual, does not have an administrative \nclassification.  This  reduced  the  accountability  of  administrative  units.  The  PEFA  assessment \nalso  identified  existence  of  sizable  quasi-fiscal  activities  that  increased  fiscal  risk.  Likewise, \npublic  access  to  information  was  limited  and  information  provided  tended  to  be  partial  and \nincomplete. \n \n5. \nPolicy-Based  Budgeting.  The  budget  calendar  was  found  to  be  broadly  followed,  but \nthe PEFA assessment found that issues regarding the detailed organization of the process and \nrelated  internal  deadlines  remain.  There  were  also  institutional  and  systemic  weaknesses  that \nhampered the linkage between policies and the budget. Further, capital budgeting was found to \nbe fragmented, and needed to be integrated with recurrent expenditures. \n \n6. \nPredictability and Control of Budget Execution. The PEFA assessment found system \nweaknesses  in  the  predictability  and  control  of  budget  execution.  On  the  revenue  side,  there \nwere deficiencies in tax administration. Implementing regulations for the tax and customs codes \nwere  found  to  be  incomplete.  Key  structures  to  support  tax  administration  were  missing  (i.e., \nthere  was  no  centralized  database  for  taxpayer  registration,  no  functioning  tax  audit  program, \nand  no  distinction  between  audit  and  assessment  functions).  The  PEFA  assessment  also \nappraised  the  reconciliation  between  tax  assessment  and  collections  as  ineffective.  On  the \nexpenditure  side,  public  payroll  controls  were  found  to  be  weak.  Procurement  reforms,  while \ninitiated, still needed to be institutionalized. Internal audit was also found to be inadequate. \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n50 \n \n\nAppendix 7 \n\nAccounting,  Recording  and  Reporting.  The  PEFA  assessment  found  that  account \n7. \nreconciliation was undertaken in a timely manner, and reports appear to be reliable. However, it \nassessed  that  accounting  standards  do  not  comply  with  international  norms.  Moreover, \naccounting standards  used  were  not  systematically  disclosed  in  published  documents.  Budget \nexecution reports, while submitted to the Parliament, were not submitted for external audit. \n \n8. \nExternal Scrutiny and Audit. External scrutiny and audit were assessed to be deficient. \nThe  PEFA  assessment  found  that  legislative  oversight  was  satisfactory,  but  the  lack  of \nadministrative  classification  limited  the  ability  to  make  the  executive  branch  accountable.  The \nindependence  of  the  public  external  audit  institution  was  also  found  to  be  lacking.  The \nassessment also found that the Government's decision to combine the external audit and anti-\ncorruption functions under one agency does not conform to international practice. \n \n9. \nDonor  Practices.  The  PEFA  assessment  gave  poor  ratings  for  donor  practices  in \nTajikistan.  Harmonization  and  alignment  of  donor  support  were  found  to  be  limited.  Direct \nbudget  support  was  provided  by  just  a  few  donors,  and  was  not  sufficiently  predictable.  Basic \nreporting  structures  established  for  aid  were  not  closely  linked  with  budget  planning  and \nreporting.  Donors  do  not  use  national  systems  to  manage  aid,  due  to  the  perception  they  are \nweak, except in the case of direct budget support. \n \nB. \n \n10. \nThe Government, supported by several donors, has embarked on several PFM reforms. \nThese  reforms  span  three  areas:  (i)  budgeting,  (ii)  revenue  reforms,  and  (iii)  financial  control \nreforms. In the area of budgeting reforms, a medium-term expenditure framework (MTEF) was \nadopted  in  2006,  and  implementation  was  piloted  in  the  education  sector  in  2007.  The  first  3-\nyear MTEF was issued by the Ministry of Finance and submitted to Parliament in August 2007. \nThe MTEF is being complemented by the introduction of per capita financing in the education \nand  health  sectors.  These  reforms  are  expected  to  improve  the  credibility  and  predictability  of \nthe  budget.  In  response  to  the  PEFA  assessment  findings,  the  budget  classification  has  been \nrevised. Quarterly budget execution reports are issued regularly. \n\nRecent PFM Developments \n\n \nRevenue  reforms  are  focused  on  improvement  of  tax  administration.  The  Large \n11. \nTaxpayers  Inspectorate  has  been  functionally  reorganized.  The  Tax  Committee  has  likewise \nintroduced limited automation in revenue collection.   \n\n \nIn the area of financial control, the Government is implementing its 2007 public internal \n12. \nfinancial control strategy. The legal framework is being strengthened. The Public Finance Law \nwas amended in November 2007 to improve its provisions on accountability, good governance, \nrisk, and internal audit. The drafts of the Public Internal Financial Control Law and Internal Audit \nLaw have been prepared and are undergoing review, with the legislation targeted for completion \nby the end of 2009. Decentralization of internal audit has been initiated. Internal audit units were \nestablished  in  five  ministries  in  2008,  and  were  fully  staffed  by  April  2009.  An  internal  audit \nmanual  and  guidelines  on  internal  controls  are  being  developed.  In  September  2008,  the \nGovernment  adopted  a  strategy  and  action  plan  to  establish  an  independent  public  external \naudit institution. Preparation of draft legislation for this is ongoing. \n\n \n13. \nThe  procurement  law  was  enacted  in  2006  to  facilitate  a  modern  public  procurement \nsystem.  Regulations  have  been  issued  and  standard  bidding  documents  adopted.  Training  of \nthe public procurement agency staff has been completed. Procurement units in six government \nentities were made fully functional in 2008.  \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 7 \n\n51\n\nThe Government of Tajikistan's Public Finance Management Strategy \n\nTreasury  management  reforms  are  being  undertaken  to  improve  financial  control.  This \n14. \nhas  been  started  by  extending  the  existing  treasury  system  to  73  territorial  treasury  divisions. \nThe automation of existing functions and integration of various treasury databases into a single \ndatabase have likewise been initiated. \n \nC. \n \n15. \nThe Public Financial Management Strategy for 2009\u20132018 was approved in March 2009 \nand aims to: (i) increase the focus on reform efforts, taking into account reform sequencing and \nprioritization; (ii) harmonize and interlink various PFM reforms; (iii) improve the effectiveness of \nreform implementation; and (iv) improve donor coordination and guide donor assistance to key \npriorities. Development outcomes are to achieve improved fiscal discipline, allocative efficiency \nand operational efficiency. A quantitative target of the strategy is to improve Tajikistan's PEFA \nscore by more than 50%. This means tripling the number of indicators with a ranking of \"A\" and \n\"B\" and halving the number of indicators with \"C\" or \"D\" rankings. \n \nSeven  sequential  reform  tasks  to  be  undertaken  between  2009  and  2018  have  been \n16. \nidentified  under  the  strategy.  These  are:  (i)  reinforcing  budget  stability,  and  the  credibility, \ncomprehensiveness and transparency of the budget; (ii) setting clear roles and responsibilities \nat the central government level; (iii) building  national PFM capacity; (iv) improving checks and \nbalances;  (v)  improving  the  policy-based  budgeting  process;  (vi)  automating  all  business \nprocesses  of  the  PFM  system  and  introducing  a  proper  treasury  single  account  (TSA);  and                        \n(vii) developing fiscal decentralization.  Activities for each task are given in Table A7.2. \n \n\nTable A7.2: Tasks under the Public Finance Management Strategy \n\n1.4 \n\n1.3 \n\nTasks \n\n \nItem \n           Task 1: Reinforce budget stability, credibility, comprehensiveness and transparency \n1.1 \n1.2 \n\nSubstantially improve the quality of macroeconomic and fiscal forecasting before 2012. \nBy 2012, substantially improve the quality of budget expenditure planning (improve planning of \nextra budgetary funds and of the supplementary budget). \nEnsure that government borrowing during 2009\u20132012 complies with the approved public debt \nmanagement strategy. \nStarting  in  2011,  valuate  fiscal  risks  by  2011,  mainly  focusing  on  state-owned  enterprises \n(SOEs). \nIn  2009  develop,  approve  and  start  implementing  a  plan  on  approaching  the  national \naccounting  standards  of  the  public  sector  to  accrual-based  International  Public  Sector \nAccounting Standards (IPSAS) for 2009\u20132018. \nDevelop and implement a unified chart of accounts during 2009\u20132012. \nEnsure  that  the  budget  is  formulated  based  on  an  administrative  classification,  starting  from \n2010;  starting  from  2012,  annual  budget  ensure  reports  are  prepared  based  on  a  chart  of \naccounts unified with the budget classification. \nEnsure presentation of one investment plan, starting with the 2011 budget.  \nBy 2012, (i) improve the efficiency and effectiveness of revenue collection, and (ii) develop and \nintegrate  an  automated  tax  management  system  with  an  automated  financial  management \nsystem.  \n\n1.8 \n1.9 \n\n1.6 \n1.7 \n\n1.5 \n\n1.10  By  2011,  ensure  full  compliance  of  public  procurement  practices  with  the  Law  on  Public \n\nProcurement of Goods, Works and Services. \n\n1.11  By 2012, develop a commitment control system \n           Task 2: Set clear roles and responsibilities at central government level \n2.1 \n\nBy  2011,  clearly  define  the  (future)  public  financial  management  (PFM)  functions  of  line \nministries. \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 7 \n\n \n\n52 \n \n\nItem \n2.2 \n\n2.3 \n\nTasks \nConduct institutional reorganization of the Ministry of Finance (MOF) so that the organizational \nstructure of the MOF clearly reflects its main functions in the PFM system by 2011. \nBy  2012,  strengthen  the  role  of  the  country\u2019s  political  guidance  in  the  process  of  budget \nformulation. \n\n           Task 3: Build national public financial management capacity \n3.1 \n\nBy 2012, create an effective system of advanced training and retraining of personnel employed \nin drafting an accounting methodology in the budget system. \nFrom 2010 onwards, ensure effective coordination of donor support and projects aimed at PFM \ncapacity building.  \n\n3.2 \n\n           Task 4: Improve checks and balances \n4.1 \n\nBy  2012,  establish  an  independent  external  audit  body  that  executes  the  functions  of  a \nsupreme audit institution for Tajikistan.

Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \n \nThe Government's long-term development vision and goals are outlined in the National Development Strategy (NDS) 2007\u2013\n2015.  The  overarching  goal  of  the  NDS  is  to  improve  the  living  standards  of  the  population  through  economic  growth  and \nachievement  of  the  Millennium  Development  Goals  (MDGs).  The  NDS  identifies  three  priorities:  (i)  improvement  of  public \nadministration, (ii) promotion of sustainable economic growth, and (ii) human development.  \n \nThe Second Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper 2007\u20132009 (PRSP 2) was approved in 2007 and represented a medium-term \nstrategic plan for the implementation of NDS outcomes. PRSP 2 is organized along three main pillars: (i) the functional pillar \nprovides  for  an  overall  institutional  framework  through  public  administration  reform,  and  improvement  of  the  investment \nclimate, regional cooperation and international integration; (ii) the production pillar emphasizes the importance of reforms and \ninvestment  in  sectors  that  form  the  backbone  of  the  economy  (i.e.,  agriculture,  energy,  infrastructure  and  industry);  and  \n(iii) the social pillar underlines the Government's commitment to improve (a) basic social services in education, health, water \nsupply and sanitation, housing, and social protection; as well (b) gender equality and the environment. \n \nTajikistan  has  made  good  progress  in  poverty  reduction  in  recent  years  owing  to  stable  economic  growth.  However,  the \nsevere  impact  of  the  global  financial  crisis  poses  a  serious  threat  to  economic  stability,  and  could  cause  social  tensions  by \nincreasing unemployment and economic hardship on low-income households. \n \nThe proposed program is included in the new country partnership strategy (CPS), which is currently being finalized. The draft \nCPS underlines the program's contribution to facilitating the Government's crisis mitigation efforts as well as in supporting the \noverarching CPS objective of poverty reduction. \n \nB.  Poverty and Social Analysis                                  Targeting Classification: General intervention \n \n1.  Key Issues  \n \nWith  an  annual  per  capita  income  of  $795,  Tajikistan  is  the  poorest  country  in  Central  Asia.  Poverty  has  been  reduced \nconsiderably  since  the  late  1990s  but  remains  widespread.  Over  half  (53%)  of  Tajikistan's  population  of  7  million  lives  in \npoverty,  and  17%  in  extreme  poverty.a  Tajikistan's  per  capita  income  of  $795  is  the  lowest  in  Central  Asia.  While  social \nindicators  have  improved  somewhat  since  the  end  of  the  civil  war  in  1997,  they  remain  weak.  A  large  segment  of  the \npopulation, especially in rural areas, lacks access to basic services such as water, sanitation, and electricity. It will be difficult \nfor Tajikistan to achieve many of the MDGs. \n  \nThe poverty and social impact from the crisis will be direct and immediate. A 2007 ADB survey indicates that as many as 40% \nof  all  households,  and  71%  of  households  in  the  poorest  quintile,  receive  remittances.b  Low-income  households  use \nremittances to meet basic needs, making remittances in effect an important part of the country\u2019s safety net. Unemployment, \nalready at about 40%, will rise sharply as overseas migrant workers return in large numbers. \n \nMitigating the adverse impact of the crisis and providing adequate social protection to poor and vulnerable households is the \nmost pressing challenge facing the Government. \n \n2. Design Features \n \nThe  program  will  provide  direct  support  in  mitigating  the  adverse  impact  of  the  crisis  by  financing  expenditures  related  to: \nemployment  programs;  social  assistance  to  poor  and  vulnerable  groups;  and  food  and  utilities  for  education,  health,  and \nsocial  protection  institutions.  The  program  is  fully  aligned  with  the  Government's  crisis  mitigation  and  expenditure \nmanagement plans.  \n\n\f \n\n \n\nB.  Consultation and Participation \n\n \n\nAppendix 8 \n\n55\n\n1.  Provide a summary of the consultation and participation process during the program preparation \n \nThe program was prepared in response to the urgent request made by the Government in January 2009. The program was \nprepared in close consultation with the Government, and in particular  with the Ministry of Finance in assessing fiscal needs \nand with Ministry of Labor and Social Protection of the Population in assessing employment and social impacts. The program \nis part of a concerted donor effort to help mitigate the adverse impact of the financial crisis.  \n \nWhat level of consultation and participation (C&P) is envisaged during the project implementation and monitoring?  \n\n  Information sharing       \n\n  Consultation      \n\n  Collaborative decision making     \n\n Empowerment \n\n No  \n\n Yes    \n\n \n3.

If no, explain why. \n \nADB  will  prepare  and  implement  a  C&P  plan  under  a  separate  regional  technical  assistance  (RETA)  covering  Tajikistan, \nArmenia  and  Georgia.  One  of  the  main  RETA  components  will  be  complaints  mechanisms  for  beneficiary  selection  and \nprocurement selection undertaken for program-related expenditures. \n \nC.
