As more than 50%  of the poor  population in  Viet \nNam  belongs  to  ethnic  minority  groups,  the  project  will  target  the  following  three  areas  which \nhave  large  ethnic  minority  populations:  northern  midland  and  mountainous  areas,  central \nhighlands,  and  Mekong  River  Delta. 3 In  addition,  the  project  will  target  the  north  central  and \ncentral coastal areas, which are frequently affected by typhoons. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\nA. \n \nSocioeconomic  context.  Viet  Nam\u2019s  economy  has  grown  robustly  since  the  early \n3. \n2000s, an expansion that has been associated with significant achievements in the Millennium \nDevelopment  Goals.  Consistently  strong  economic  growth,  together  with  limited  population \nincrease,  raised  per  capita  income  from  $390  in  2000  to  $1,596  in  2012.  A  survey \ncommissioned by the Ministry of Labour, Invalids and Social Affairs in 2013 found that poverty \nincidence  in  Viet  Nam  dropped  from  20%  in  2000  to  less  than  8%  in  2013. 4 However,  the \ndecline  in  poverty  has  not  been  uniform  across  the  different  regions  of  the  country,  and  the \nincidence of poverty varies significantly across regions and among ethnic groups. Remote areas, \nincluding  Northern  mountains,  central  highlands,  and  Mekong  River  Delta;  and  coastal  areas \nfaced threats of natural disasters, are considered particularly poor and vulnerable.  \n \n4. \nEthnic  minorities  and  education  in  Viet  Nam.  Viet  Nam  has  54  ethnic  groups, \nincluding  the  majority  Kinh  (Vietnamese);  ethnic  minorities  account  for  13%  of  the  total \npopulation. The ethnic minority groups mainly inhabit mountainous, coastal, and remote areas, \nwhich  have  a  complex  topography,  difficult  transportation  and  communication,  and  harsh \nclimates. Most ethnic minorities still depend mainly on agriculture for their livelihood.  Paid jobs \nin rural areas are still limited by a number of factors, such as low level of education, less mobility \nand  productive  lands,  limited  Vietnamese  language  capacity,  less  market  access,  and  cultural \nbarriers.  The  World  Bank\u2019s  Viet  Nam  Poverty  Assessment,  2012  reported  that,  as  of  2010, \nabout  66.3%  of  ethnic  minorities  still  lived  below  the  poverty  line  and  37.4%  lived  below  the \nextreme  poverty  line,  on  average.  In  comparison,  12.9%  of  the  Kinh  majority  population  was \npoor and 2.9% lived below the extreme poverty line in 2010. 5 \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB).  2007.

As \nindicated  in  the  Education  Development  Strategic  Plan,  2011\u20132020,  one  of  the  priority \nsubsectors in Viet Nam is LSE, which is considered a basic need for good quality life and labor \ncompetitiveness. 6 The  government\u2019s  Socio-Economic  Development  Strategy,  2011\u20132020  also \nrequests that the Constitution affirms the rights of minorities to education by providing support \nfor their children to obtain education relevant to their needs. 7  However, gaps remain in access \nto and completion of good quality LSE among different regions and gender. While the national \nnet  enrollment rate (NER)  in  LSE  already  reached  at  98%  in school  year (SY)  2011/2012, the \nNER  in  LSE  was  only  77.1%  in  northern  midland  and  mountainous  area,  77.7%  in  central \nhighland, and 73.3% in the Mekong river delta. \n   \n6. \nAchievements of the first  project. The first project primarily aimed to improve access \nto and retention in LSE in the 103 most disadvantaged districts of the poorest 17 provinces. The \nachievements of the first project from SY2008/09 to SY2011/12 are (i) an increase in the NER in \nthe  project  schools  from  73.9%  to  75.4%,  (ii)  a  decrease  in  the  dropout  rate  from  3.81%  to \n2.71%, (iii) an improvement in the completion rate from 96.17% to 96.96%, and (iv) an increase \nin the promotion rate from 92.28% to 93.62%.8  \n \n7. \nRemaining  and  new  challenges.  While  the  first  project  is  expected  to  be  rated \nsuccessful  in  achieving  its  project  outcome,  several  issues  remain  and  new  challenges  have \nemerged:  (i)  the  access  of  ethnic  minorities  to  LSE  is  still  limited  because  of  the  lack  of \nclassrooms and semi-boarding facilities, as well as the lack of awareness among parents of the \nneed for education, particularly for girls; (ii) the LSE curriculum is irrelevant to the local needs of \nethnic groups, and the low quality of teaching and learning results in less motivation for ethnic \nminority  students  to  complete  LSE;  and  (iii)  small  lower  secondary  schools  (LSSs)  in  remote \nareas  have  scarce  financial  and  human  resources,  which  makes  it  difficult  to  provide  (a) \ncapacity  development  opportunities  for  teachers  and  school  principals,  and  (b)  education \nfacilities such as libraries and science laboratories. \n \n8. \nLimited  access  and  retention.  Although  the  national  NER  for  LSE  has  improved \nsignificantly,  it  is  still  below  the  government\u2019s  target,  partly  because  of  the  lower  rates  in \ndisadvantaged  areas.  The  NER  for  the  target  LSSs  in  the  first  project  was  75.4%  while  the \nnational average was 81.4% in 2012 (footnote 3). Girls accounted for only 45.3% of the enrolled \nethnic group students in the project areas in SY2012/13, indicating a gender gap. Dropout rates \namong  LSE  students  in  disadvantaged  areas  are  still  high.  In  the  disadvantaged  provinces \nserved by the first project, the dropout rate in SY2010/11 of ethnic minority students was 4.5%, \ncompared  with  the  overall  rate  of  2.7%  in  these  areas.  Commuting  difficulties,  demand  on \nchildren  to  support  their  families,  and  early  marriages  all  undermine  the  ability  of  children  in \nethnic  minority  areas  to  attend  schools.  In  many  disadvantaged  areas,  the  percentage  of \ntemporary schools is still higher than the national norm. Boarding facilities for students, kitchens, \nand sanitation facilities in remote areas either do not exist or do not meet standards. \n \n9. \nPoor  quality  and  relevance  of  teaching  and  learning.  While  the  performance  of  15-\nyear old students in Viet Nam is high relative to many developing and developed countries,9 the \n\n                                                \n6  Government  of  Viet  Nam.  2012.

Paris.: OECD Publishing. \n\n\f3 \n\nachievement  of  disadvantaged  students,  particularly  ethnic  minorities,  is  much  lower. 10  In \nSY2008/09, only 38.5% of grade 9 ethnic minority students achieved the acceptable standard in \nmathematics,  compared  with  62.2%  for  the  majority  Kinh  student  population.  In  physics,  only \n44.4%  of  ethnic  minority  students  achieved  the  acceptable  standard,  compared  with  60.6%  for \nKinh  students.  Only  31.0%  of  grade  9  students  in  the  central  highlands  area  achieved  the \nstandard in mathematics. The Ministry of Education and Training (MOET) is undertaking several \nreforms  to  perform  well  internationally,  while  better  addressing  the  needs  of  disadvantaged \nstudents.  The  reforms  include  improving  the  quality  of  teaching  methods,  upgrading  the \ncurriculum, and carrying out initiative designed to improve participation and achievement among \ntargeted  student  populations.  MOET  will  adopt  a  new  curriculum  after  2015  in  accordance  with \nanticipated economic and social needs. This new curriculum framework will provide flexibility for \nregions of the country to develop programs that are relevant and suitable to their conditions. \n \nLimited  financial  and  human  resources  in  remote  schools.  School  managers  and \n10. \nteachers  in  remote  areas  have  fewer  opportunities  to  exchange  and  share  professional \nexperience.  They  also  lack  opportunities  to  receive  regular  in-service  training  or  to  engage  in \nself-development  activities  to  improve  their  skills,  particularly  in  science  and  math  education, \nlanguage training, and extracurricular activities offered at school libraries, which can function as \nresource centers for ethnic minority teachers and students. Several remote areas are facing a \nshortage of LSE teachers, partly because of this lack of opportunity to improve their knowledge \nand  professional qualifications.  School-based  planning  and management capacity  also tend to \nbe  weak  in  disadvantaged  areas.  Moreover,  the  government\u2019s  regular  budgets  and  human \nresources to support improvements in the quality of LSE are insufficient in disadvantaged areas. \n \nGovernment  development  plan  and  ADB\u2019s  country  partnership  strategy.  The \n11. \ngovernment\u2019s  Socio-Economic  Development  Plan,  2011\u20132015  focuses  on  the  needs  for \nrestructuring  and  reforming  education.  The  government\u2019s  Secondary  Education  Sector  Master \nPlan,  2011\u20132015  to  2020  provides  more  details  about  how  education  will  be  reformed.  Some \ninitiatives  supported  by  the  project  related  to  the  Socio-Economic  Development  Plan  include \ndecentralizing the system, improving teaching methods, revising the curriculum to make it more \nrelevant  and  practical,  and  improving  the  poor  physical  condition  of  school  infrastructure.  In \naddition to these initiatives, the Secondary Education Sector Master Plan supports education in \ndisadvantaged  areas,  prioritizes  services  for  ethnic  minority  children,  provides  semi-boarding \nfacilities,  supports  environmental  education,  expands  vocational  consulting,  and  develops \nminority  courses  in  LSSs.  The  country  partnership  strategy  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank \n(ADB) for Viet Nam, 2012\u2013201511 supports the government\u2019s initiatives, specifically with regard \nto  ensuring  inclusive  growth  by  helping  integrate  the  poor  and  other  vulnerable  groups  and \nsegments of society in the development process and by enhancing environmental sustainability \nthrough well-planned and timely responses to environment and climate change challenges. \n \nLessons from the first project. In the design and implementation arrangements of the \n12. \nsecond project, lessons from the first project have been taken into consideration. These include \nthe following: (i) target identification in districts and schools, instead of at the province level, can \nreduce  intra-provincial  poverty;  (ii) the  definition of  disadvantaged  area  needs  to  be  expanded \nfrom  three  ethnic  minority  regions  with  high  income-poverty  rates  to  include  the  typhoon-\naffected  areas,  which  are  equally  poor  and  vulnerable;12 (iii)  the  system  to  cascade  teacher \n\n                                                \n10 Ministry of Education and Training (MOET). 2009.

Manila. \n12 Under  ADB\u2019s  project  preparatory  TA  for  the  project,  an  intensive  socioeconomic  and  educational  survey  was \nconducted  for  the  selection  of  the  target  provinces,  as  outlined  in  the  Selection  Procedure  and  Criteria  for \nBeneficiary Provinces, Districts, and Schools (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n\f4 \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\ntraining through core trainers, which was adopted under the first project, often diluted the impact \nof  the  new  teaching method,  and  local  LSS  teachers  want  to receive training  directly;  and (iv) \nthe  school  feeding  and  scholarship  program  implemented  in  the  first  project  has  been \nsuccessful, and the government adopted this as a national policy and continues to implement it \nwith their own annual budget. Lessons from other ADB projects and other donor partners13 were \nalso considered during the design of this project.14 \n \n13. \nInnovative  features  of  the  project.  The  project  includes  some  pilot  initiatives  and \nconcepts which are new to Viet Nam or ADB-funded education projects in the country. Five new \ninitiatives  include:  (i)  new  regional  competency-based  textbooks  will  be  developed  to  better \nmeet  the  needs  of  ethnic  students;  (ii)  existing  continuing  education  centers  (CECs)  will  be \nrestructured from non-formal education centers to serve as new platforms for in-service teacher \ntraining  (INSETT);  (iii)  a  new  system  of  school  clusters  will  be  estalished  to  exchange  of \nexpertise  and  experiences  among  teachers  and  managers;  (iv)  model  libraries  will  provide \nvenues  for  extracurricular  academic  support  and  recreation  for  ethnic  minority  students  as  a \npositve  alternative  to  drug  and  alcohol  use,  and  to  help  reduce  teenage  pregnancy;  and  (v) \ntyphoon-resilient facilities  and  disaster management  education  will  be  provided  to  help  reduce \n(a) school dropouts because of the loss of school buildings, and (b) the cost of maintenance or \nreconstruction of damaged LSSs borne annually by the poor local goverments.  \n \nB. \n \n14. \nThe  impact  will  be  reduced disparities in socioeconomic development  between regions \nand ethnic groups. The outcome will be more equitable access and retention of ethnic minorities, \ngirls,  and  disadvantaged  children  in  LSSs  in  the  northern  midland  and  mountainous  areas, \ncentral  highlands,  Mekong  River  Delta,  and north  central  and  central  coastal  areas,  which are \nfrequently affected by typhoons. \n \nC. \n \n15. \nOutput  1:  Increased  access  to  lower  secondary  education  and  lower  secondary \neducation  equivalency  program.  This output will directly help MOET achieve the target NER \nby increasing the NER by 5 percentage points in the beneficiary districts by building necessary \nfacilities. The survey under the first project showed that the shortage of education facilities in the \nnorth and central regions  is the major reason for low  access, while families\u2019 low awareness of \nLSE  and  commuting  difficulties  are  key  factors  that  limit  opportunities  for  children  to  attend \nschool in the Mekong River Delta. School facilities that are resilient to climate change impacts \nwill be provided, particularly in the typhoon-affected coastal areas. About 660 classrooms will be \nbuilt  and  furnished.  To  attract  qualied  teahcers,  about  250  teacher  housing  units  will  be \ndeveloped. To reduce dropouts from schools caused by long commutes from home by children, \nabout  350  new  semi-boarding  facilities  and  about  37  kitchens  will  be  constructed.  About  29 \ntoilets  for  LSSs  and  57  toilets  for  semi-boarding  facilities  will  also  be  provided.  A  behavior \nchange  communication  campaign  to  encourage  parents  to  enroll  and  keep  their  children, \nespecially  girls,  in  school  will  be  supported.  The  provision  of  toilet  facilities  will  benefit  about \n432,000 students through improved sanitary conditions in LSSs, thereby reducing the incidence \nof waterborne gastrointestinal diseases among students.15 \n\nOutputs \n\n                                                \n13  Development Coordination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n14 Lessons Identified in Independent Evaluation Department Studies and Project Completion Reports for the Design \nof  the  Second  Lower  Secondary  Education  for  the  Most  Disadvantaged  Area  Project  (accessible  from  the  list  of \nlinked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n15  Because information on the incidence of diarrheal diseases in the project provinces is lacking, an incidence rate of \n\n0.345% was applied in the economic analysis. \n\n\f5 \n\ninstructional  materials  and \n\n \nOutput  2:  Decentralization  of  teaching  and  learning  tools  developed.  This  output \n16. \naims to improve the quality and relevance of LSE to meet the needs, as well as the social and \ncultural backgrounds, of ethnic minority students. This will lead to higher enrollment and student \nretention,  an  increased  promotion  rate,  lower  dropout  rate,  and  increased  abilities  of  LSE \nstudents  to  make  informed  decisions  regarding  their  further  studies  and  career  choices  after \ncompleting  LSE.  The  project  will  develop  new  regional  competency-based  textbooks  in  LSE \nsubjects to address the needs in disadvantaged areas. To meet the professional development \nneeds  of  teachers,  86  district  CECs  will  be  designated  to  serve  as  platforms  for  providing \nINSETT for LSE teachers.16 The project will produce instructional materials on the preservation \nand promotion of ethnic minority cultures and values. To help mitigate the adverse physical and \nfinancial  effects  of  natural  disasters, \nINSETT  on  disaster \nmanagement  education  will  be  provided.  Vocational  counseling  services  will  be  supported  to \nmake students aware of alternative career paths, both within and outside their local area. \n \n17. \nOutput  3:  New  school  clusters  established. This output will help improve the quality \nof  LSE  in  poor  isolated  LSSs  by  networking  them  using  information  and  communication \ntechnology within school clusters. This will allow them to share the limited human, financial, and \neducational  resources  available  in  ethnic  minority  areas.  This  output  includes  the  provision  of \nschool  block  grants  for  better  cluster  management,  improvement  of  science  education,  and \ndevelopment of model libraries within the school clusters. A system of about 344 school clusters \nand  teachers\u2019  networks  will  be  established  within  and  among  the  schools  to  encourage \ncooperation and exchange of expertise and experiences among teachers. To strengthen school-\nbased  planning  and  management  capacity  and  to  reinforce  cooperation  among  the  schools  in \nthe clusters, the project will pilot block grants by providing funds to about 100 clusters. \n \n18. \nOutput  4:  Project  implementation  and  monitoring  and  evaluation  capacity \nenhanced.

A gender analysis and gender action plan (GAP) has been prepared.29 The GAP aims to \nnarrow gender disparities and among ethnic minority girls. The GAP will ensure that (i) 50% of \nthe semi-boarding spaces are allocated to female students; (ii) 50% of the teacher housing are \nallocated  to  female  teachers;  (iii)  100%  of  female  and  male  teachers  in  project  schools  are \ntrained  on  the  new  curriculum  in  key  subject  areas;  (iv)  new  instructional  materials  and \ntextbooks  are  gender-sensitive;  (v)  100%  of  female  education  managers  are  trained  on \nmanaging  the  school  clusters;  (vi)  the  school  performance monitoring  systems  will  report  sex-\ndisaggregated  data  on  access,  reduction  of  dropouts,  and  completion of LSE  in project  areas; \nand (vii) progress updates on the GAP are reported on a biannual basis to ADB. \n \nE. \n \n27. \nInvoluntary  resettlement.  The  project  is  classified  as  B  for  involuntary  resettlement. \nCivil works will be done inside the compounds of existing LSSs, and land acquisition is unlikely. \nIf some facilities require land, it will be minimal because of the nature of the civil works. Facilities \nthat will involve significant land acquisition or resettlement impacts will not be considered for the \nproject.  Initial  screening  of  the  200  shortlisted  LSSs  for  the  construction  of  additional  facilities \ndid  not  identify  any  land  acquisition  or  resettlement  impacts.  This  will  be  confirmed  when  the \nshortlist  of  LSSs  and  facilities  to  be  constructed  has  been  finalized  and  approved.  A \nresettlement  and  ethnic  minority  development  framework  was  prepared  to  guide  field-based \nscreening  of  each  of  the  proposed  facilities  and  LSSs.  Measures  to  address  potential  land \nacquisition  and  resettlement  impacts,  as  well  as  adverse  impacts  on  ethnic  minorities,  have \nbeen identified and included in the framework. \n \n28. \nIndigenous  people  (ethnic  minority  groups).  The  project  is  classified  as  B  for \nindigenous people safeguards. The proportion of ethnic minority population is one of the criteria \nused for selecting the districts to be included in the project. Measures to benefit ethnic minorities \nin  the  project  areas  include  (i)  constructing  additional  educational  facilities  in  ethnic  minority \nareas;  (ii)  encouraging  ethnic  minority  parents  to  enroll  their  children  in  LSSs;  (iii)  developing \nregional textbooks suitable to the needs of ethnic minority students; (iv) producing instructional \nmaterials  on  promotion  of  ethnic  minority  cultures;  (v)  providing  vocational  counseling  and \nguidance  suitable  for  ethnic  minority  areas;  and  (vi)  establishing  teacher  networks  in  ethnic \nminority areas. Adverse impacts on ethnic minorities are not anticipated. Minor impacts, if any, \nwill  be  limited  to  loss  of  land  in  the  unlikely  event  that  a  facility  will  have  to  be  constructed \nbeyond  the  existing  LSS  compounds.  The  resettlement  and  ethnic  minority  development \nframework  describes  the  project  elements  that  benefit  ethnic  minorities  and  will  guide  the \nscreening of any site-specific adverse impacts of facilities on ethnic minorities. \n \n29. \nEnvironment. The project is classified as  environment category C. The construction of \nadditional school facilities will have limited adverse impacts in the form of noise, dust, vegetation \nremoval and clearance, localized erosion and sedimentation, and waste disposal. \n \n \n \n\n                                                \n28 Government of Viet Nam. 2013. 2012 Statistics Yearbook of Viet Nam.
