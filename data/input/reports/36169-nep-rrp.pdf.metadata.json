Nepal has a population of 25 million, including \n22 million people in the rural sector. While rural poverty has been \ndeclining, mainly due to the large inflow of remittances, it remains \npervasive.  About  95%  of  the  poor  in  the  country  are  rural.  Rural \npoverty  is  rooted  in  limited  landholding,  scarce  non-land  assets, \nlow agricultural productivity, and lack of access to social services \nand economic infrastructure. For the rural population, the political \ninsurgency  and  conflict  during  the  past  decade  also  caused \npersonal \ninsecurity,  dislocation,  and  disruption  of  business \nactivities. As the political conflict and insurgency was largely rural, \nit affected the rural population most. \n \nAccess  to  reliable  and  affordable  financial  services  is  crucial  for \nthe rural poor to capture the opportunities of the reviving economy \nand  break  the  vicious  cycle  of  poverty.  Increased  financial \nintermediation  will  enable  resources  to  flow  to  the  rural  sector, \ngiving the rural poor opportunities to invest in productive activities, \nreconstruct  their  livelihoods,  and  improve  their  incomes.  This  will \ncontribute  to  political  and  economic  stability  in  rural  areas.  Yet, \naccess  to  institutional  financial  services  in  Nepal  is  severely \nlimited, reaching only 28% of the total population. \n \nRural  finance  (RF)  can  be  deepened  significantly  and  rapidly  to \nreduce  poverty  in  Nepal\u2019s  context  by  revitalizing  and  enhancing \nthe  network  RF \ninstitutions  (RFI).  A  high-risk  RF  profile, \nrepressive  policy  environment,  and  security  concerns  in  rural \nareas  make  private  sector  participation  in  RF  extremely  difficult. \nDifficult terrain and topography inhibits rapid deployment of private \ninstitutional RF services on a larger scale. Wider sector reform is \nrequired  to  address  the  policy  and  institutional  bottlenecks  to \ngrowth and development of efficient and sustainable RF services \nfor the poor. \n \n\n\fii \nii \n\nThe Program Loan \n            Objectives \n\n \n \n \n\nComponents and \nOutputs  \n\n \n            Financing Plan \n\n \n\n \n\nII  will  aim \n\nThe  goals  of  the  Rural  Finance  Sector  Development  Cluster \nProgram  (RFSDCP)  are  to  (i)  ensure  sustainable  access  of  rural \nhouseholds  to  institutional  financial  services,  and  (ii)  encourage \nprivate  sector  participation  in  the  RF  sector.  The  objective  is  to \ndevelop a sustainable RF system to generate income and reduce \npoverty of rural households.  \n \nConsidering the comprehensiveness of the sector reform, and the \nmedium-term  approach  to  institutional  reforms,  RFSDCP  will  be \nstructured  in  two  sequential  subprograms  under  the  program \ncluster  modality.  The  objective  of  subprogram  I  is  to  develop  an \nenabling  RF  sector  framework  through  policy,  legal,  regulatory, \nand  institutional  reforms.  As  a  continuation  of  subprogram  I, \nsubprogram \nto  promote  a  conducive  sector \nenvironment,  expand  sound  RF  outreach,  and  enhance  private \nsector  participation  in  RF.  The  processing  of  subprogram  II  is \nsubject to the review of the implementation of subprogram I. The \nreview of subprogram I does not obligate the Asian Development \nBank  (ADB)  to  provide  loans  for  additional  subprograms  under \nRFSDCP. Subprogram II will be subject to the approval of ADB\u2019s \nBoard of Directors.  \n \nThe  program  components  of  RFSDCP  are  (i)  policy  reforms  to \ncreate  an  enabling  RF  sector  environment,  (ii)  restructuring  and \nreforms  of  RFIs,  (iii)  supportive  legal  and  regulatory  framework, \n(iv)  sector  capacity  building,  and  (v)  product  and  process \ninnovations.  The  policy  reforms  are  to  deregulate  and  liberalize \nRFIs  to  limit  Government  interventions,  and  to  increase  private \nsector  participation.  RFSDCP  supports  fundamental  reform  and \nrestructuring  of \nthe  Agricultural \nDevelopment  Bank  Limited  (ADBL)  for  commercialization  and, \neventually, privatization.  \n  \nEach  subprogram  of  RFSDCP  has  policy  and  institutional  reform \ntargets.  The  emphasis  of  subprogram  I  will  be  consolidating  the \nfragmented  RF  regulatory  framework,  initiating commercialization \nof RFI operations, and upgrading the sector capacity. Subprogram \nII will continue to promote the policy and institutional reforms, and \nwill  expand  commercial-based  RF  service  outreach,  and \nprivatization of important RFIs.  \n \nAs proposed, ADB will provide a loan of $56 million from the Asian \nDevelopment  Fund  for  subprogram  I  of  RFSDCP.  The  loan  will \nhave a term of 24 years, including a grace period of 8 years, with \ninterest rate of 1.0% during the grace period and 1.5% thereafter; \nand  such  other  terms  and  conditions  set  forth  in  the  Loan \nAgreement.  \n \n \n \n\nthe  major  RFIs, \n\nincluding \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n            Procurement and     \n            Disbursement \n\n \n            Program Period    \n            and Tranche \n\nRelease \n\nExecuting Agency \nand \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\nCounterpart \nFunds \n\n \nThe Project Grant \nObjective  \n \n\nFinancing Plan  \n\nthe \n\nfirst \n\ntranche  upon \n\nthe  release  of \n\nfor  Board \nII  of  RFSDCP  will  be  presented \nSubprogram \nconsideration after completion of subprogram I and a review of the \nimplementation. \n \nIn  accordance  with  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s  Simplification  of \nDisbursement Procedures and Related Requirements for Program \nLoans, the proceeds of the program loan will be disbursed to the \nGovernment  as  the  Borrower.  The  proceeds  of  the  program  loan \nwill  be  used  to  finance  the  foreign  exchange  costs  of  imports \nproduced  in,  and  procured  from,  ADB\u2019s  member  countries,  other \nthan  those  specified  in  the  list  of  ineligible  items  and  imports \nfinanced by other bilateral and multilateral sources. \n \nRFSDCP  will  be  implemented  over  5  years  from  2007  to  2011, \nincluding  the  subprogram  review  in  2009.  Subprogram  I  is \nestimated to start in January 2007 and be completed in December \n2008.  The  program  loan  of  subprogram  I  will  be  released  in  two \ntranches  over  2  years.  The  first  tranche  of  $40  million  will  be \nreleased upon loan effectiveness, while the second tranche of $16 \nmillion  will  be  released  12  months  after  the  first  tranche.  All  the \nfirst  tranche  release  conditions  have  been  complied  with,  which \ncould  enable \nloan \neffectiveness.  Subprogram  I  allocates  more  resources  in  the  first \ntranche  to  meet  the  Government\u2019s  immediate  requirements  for \nrural investments, as emphasized in the FY2007 budget. \n \nThe  Ministry  of  Finance  (MOF)  is  the  Executing  Agency.  As  the \nImplementing  Agencies,  ADBL,  Nepal  Rastra  Bank  (the  central \nbank), and Small Farmers Development Bank will set up program \nimplementation  units.  MOF  will  constitute  a  program  steering \ncommittee  for  interagency  coordination,  comprising  the  program \nimplementation  unit  directors  and  representatives  from  MOF  and \nother Government agencies. \n \nThe  entire  counterpart  fund  (local  currency  equivalent)  of  the \nprogram  loan  of  subprogram  I  will  be  dedicated  for  the  financial \nrestructuring (recapitalization) of ADBL. ADBL will be recapitalized \nthrough  cash  subscription  of  additional  preference  shares.  The \ncounterpart  fund  to  ADBL  will  be  to  enhance  its  liquidity  to \nincrease its net loans to the rural sector, as well as improve its net \nworth  for  divestment  and  privatization.  The  Government  has \nincurred  cost  more  than  the  policy  loan  amount  as  adjustment \ncosts for the ADBL restructuring.  \n \n \nThe  objective  is  to  support  the  Government\u2019s  RF  sector  reform \nefforts  by  facilitating  institutional  reform  and  restructuring  of  key \nRFIs, and improving sector capacity and governance. \n \nAs  proposed,  ADB  will  provide  a  grant  of  $8.7  million  from  its \nAsian Development Fund resources.  \n\niii\n\n \n\n\fiv \niv \n\nExecuting Agency \nand \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\n \n \n \n \n            Procurement and   \n            Disbursement \n\n \nTechnical Assistance  \n\n \nBenefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\n \nSocial and  \nEnvironmental Issues \n\n \n\n \n\nThe  Executing  and  Implementing  Agencies,  as  well  as  the \nimplementation arrangements, for the project grant are the same \nas the program loan. The expected closing date of the grant is 30 \nJune 2009. \n \nGoods  and  services  will  be  procured  subject  to  the  provisions  of \nADB's  Procurement  Guidelines.  Grant  disbursement  will  be  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook.  All  the \nconsultants to be financed from the proceeds of the ADB grant will \nbe  recruited  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants.  The  program  management  unit  will  recruit  the \nconsultants. Where firms are to be engaged, the quality- and cost-\nbased selection method with a full technical proposal will be used \nfor selecting consultants.  \n \nA technical assistance grant of $500,000 from the Japan Special \nFund  resources  will  be  provided  for  advising  ADBL\u2019s  Board  of \nDirectors  and  senior  management  on  all  aspects  of \nthe \nrestructuring  and  reform  process.  MOF  will  be  the  Executing \nAgency, while ADBL will be the Implementing Agency. Consulting \nservices will be procured in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on \nthe  Use  of  Consultants.  The  technical  assistance  grant  modality \nwill ensure quality inputs by international and domestic experts for \nthe restructuring in line with international best practices. \n \nRFSDCP responds to a national priority for enhancing the flow of \nresources \nto  address \ndevelopment  constraints  to  broad-based  inclusive  growth  critical \nfor achieving a lasting solution to the conflict. The shift in the RF \npolicy  to  emphasize  good  governance  will  permit  sustainable  RF \nmarkets  to  develop,  enhancing  the  flow  of  resources  to  the  rural \nsector and creating significant economic opportunities for the rural \npoor. Financial and operational restructuring of ADBL will provide \nthe right incentives for the private sector to participate in RF, and \ninduce the ADBL privatization. Gains of the restructuring will come \nfrom  improved  governance,  substantial  cost  savings  through \nreducing staff and lower transaction costs for small and marginal \nfarmers over the long term. Deepening RF markets and outreach \nare correlated with rural growth and poverty reduction. As a result \nof RFSDCP, RF sector outreach is expected to increase by about \n200,000 clients by 2011.  \n \nRecognizing that the underlying causes of the conflict are persistent \npoverty,  social  exclusion,  and  lack  of  economic  opportunities  in \nrural areas, the poverty reduction impact of RFSDCP contributes to \npeace  process  in  rural  areas.  RFSDCP  will  generate  jobs  and \nenhance  incomes  significantly  through  financial  deepening  and \nefficient intermediation to increase the profitability and productivity \nof  rural  economic  activities.  Further,  RFSDCP  will  not  have  any \nadverse impact on indigenous peoples or any significant adverse \nenvironmental impacts. \n\nthe  rural  sector. \n\nis  designed \n\nto \n\nIt \n\n\fRisks and Mitigating \nMeasures \n\n \n\n \n\nThe  success  of  RFSDCP  depends  on  a  number  of  assumptions \nwith  varying  risks.  Despite  the  risks,  the  political  and  sector \ncontext provides sufficient basis to expect the results and outputs \nof RFSDCP. These are: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nThe  conflict \nin  Nepal  has  subsided  almost \ncompletely,  permitting  development  activities \nthroughout  all  rural  areas  after  more  than  a \ndecade.  \n\nThe  outputs  and  outcomes  of  RFSDCP  will \naddress the root causes of rural poverty, helping to \nmitigate the revival of conflicts. \n\nRFSDCP\u2019s  conflict-sensitive  approach  assesses \nrisks  and  incorporates  mitigating  measures  in  the \nprogram design and implementation. \n\nchange.  The  Government  assured \n\n \nKey risks and mitigating measures are: \n \nAs  the  country  is  going  through  a  major  political  transition,  the \nreform  policy  of  financial  institutions\u2014especially  the  privatization \nof  RFIs\u2014may \nthe \nimplementation of RFSDCP reforms with strict adherence to laws \nand  regulations.  As  the  regulatory  requirements  are  enforced, \nGovernment  interventions  are  reduced.  Setting  specific  policy \nreform conditions for the release of the second tranche will ensure \nthe prudent use of the program loan proceeds. \n \nThe security situation in some areas remains tenuous. As a result, \nthe planned outreach expansion might be delayed in these areas. \nThough the restructuring process of ADBL does not include area-\nspecific priorities, the regional business center structure\u2014in which \na regional center will manage and control the outreach expansion \nand  service  delivery  through  local  outlets\u2014allows  the  regional \ncenter  to  engage  in  rural  outreach  selectively,  starting  from  low \nsecurity  risk  areas  and  expanding  to  other  areas  as  the  security \nsituation improves. \n \nGovernment  officials  might  have  difficulty  changing  their  mindset \nformulating  RF  sector  policies  based  on  market  and \nand \ncommercially  oriented  perspectives.  At  the  start  of  the  Program, \nan  intensive  initial  orientation  program  will  be  conducted  for \nGovernment officials and ADBL  management. The new business \nprocesses  of  the  restructured  ADBL  require  new  skill  and \ncompetencies,  which  long-serving  ADBL  employees  might  not \nhave.  The  voluntary  retirement  scheme  of  ADBL  has  released \napproximately 350 staff with adequate compensation, and another \nscheme  is  expected  to  be  implemented  in  2007.  Meanwhile, \nADBL is recruiting new staff to fill the skills gap better. \n \n\nv\n\n \n\n\fIf  the  reform  policies  are  redirected  or  RFI  restructuring  is \ndelayed,  the  private  sector  might  lose  confidence  in  the  process, \ndelaying the privatization of RFIs. The measures under RFSDCP \nto improve investor confidence include (i) up-front recapitalization \nof  ADBL  to  meet  the  minimum  capital  requirement,  (ii)  rigorous \nmonitoring  of  the  implementation  of  the  restructuring  to  meet  the \nrestructuring  performance  benchmarks,  and  (iii)  support  to  Nepal \nRastra  Bank  to  supervise  RFIs  for  good  governance  and \nsustainability. The minimum 30% public shareholding requirement \nof  the  Banks  and  Financial  Institutions  Ordinance  ensures  the \ndivestment of Government shares in the majority of formal RFIs. \n\n \n\nvi \nvi \n\n \n\n \n\n\f         \n\n \n\n\f\f \n\n \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n \n1. \nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on the Rural Finance \nSector  Development  Cluster  Program  (RFSDCP)  in  Nepal,  comprising  (i)  a  proposed  sector \ndevelopment  program  cluster  for  rural  finance  sector  development,  (ii)  a  proposed  loan  for \nsubprogram I of RFSDCP, and (iii) a proposed grant for the Rural Finance Sector Development \nProject.1  The  report  also  describes  a  proposed  technical  assistance  (TA)  grant  for  capacity \nbuilding  in  rural  finance  institutions  (RFI).  If  the  Board  of  Directors  of  the  Asian  Development \nBank  (ADB)  approves  the  proposed  sector  development  program  cluster,  loan  and  grant,  I, \nacting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, will approve the TA.2  \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE SECTOR: PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES  \n\n \nA. \n \n\n \n\nSector Description and Performance  \n\n1. \n\nMacroeconomic Context \n\n2.  \nNepal\u2019s  economic  growth  in  the  late  1990s,  which  was  induced  by  structural  reforms, \nhas reversed due to the deterioration of the security situation.3 Gross domestic product (GDP) \ngrowth has stagnated in the past several years, ranging from \u20130.4% in 2002 to 2.3% in 2005. \nThe GDP growth in 2006 is forecast to be about the same as in 2005.  \n \n3. \nNepal  is  entering  a  new  phase  of  the  peace  process.  In  April  2006,  Nepal\u2019s  political \nscenario changed dramatically following a mass movement against the erstwhile Government. \nThe dissolved Lower House of the Parliament was reinstated, followed by the formation of the \nnew  interim  coalition  government.  The  Communist  Party  of  Nepal/Maoist  (CPN/M)  declared  a \nceasefire,  and  the  Government  of  Nepal  (the  Government)  reciprocated  by  declaring  an \nindefinite ceasefire. Recently, the Government and CPN/M have held several rounds of peace \ntalks, leading to an agreement on a road map to restoring peace and democracy. This includes \nthe formation of an interim government with CPN/M\u2019s participation and elections. \n \n4. \nThese  political  developments  present  a  challenging  but  unique  opportunity  to  restore \npeace, stimulate economic recovery, and re-engage in development projects. Cognizant that the \nunderlying cause of the conflict is poverty, social exclusion, and scarce economic opportunities \nin  the  rural  sector,  the  Government  has  made  a  strong  commitment  in  its  FY2007  budget  to \nsupporting  inclusive  social  and  economic  development,  and  poverty  reduction,  in  the  rural \nsector.4  The  FY2007  budget  commits  the  Government  to  large  resource  transfers  to  support \nto  address  rural  poverty.  The  moderately \nmajor  social  and  economic \n\ntransformation \n\n                                                 \n1  In this document, RFSDCP denotes the cluster program comprising subprograms I and II. Subprogram I refers to \nthe first cluster program to be implemented for 2007\u20132008, while subprogram II is the second cluster program for \n2010\u20132011.

The  chronology  of \nevents is in Supplementary Appendix A.  \n\n3  The conflict, which started in 1996 as a small rebellion in the four western hills districts of Nepal, has affected all 75 \ndistricts,  with  36  classified  as  severely  affected.  Districts  in  midwest  and  far-west  regions,  the  most  severely \naffected, are the poorest and most isolated. \n\n4   The  budget  for  FY2007,  which  the  finance  minister  presented  on  12  July  2006,  reflects  the  Government\u2019s \n\ncommitment to initiate post-conflict reconstruction and rehabilitation to address rural poverty. \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\n2. \n\nRural Poverty Profile \n\nexpansionary budget for rural development is imperative to support of the peace process, which \nis still at an early stage.  \n \n5. \nWhile the Government will face a difficult reform environment, it recognizes the need to \nreturn  to  sound  macroeconomic  management  and  accelerate  development  activities.  The \nGovernment  has  indicated  it  will  adopt  a  two-track  approach\u2014the  political  process  for \nestablishing peace and democracy as the primary agenda, while remaining focused on reforms \nand development.5 Sector reforms, including those in the financial sector, must continue, though \nwith some modifications to accommodate the fragile political and security environment.6  \n \n \n \nRural Poverty Profile. With 31% of the population living in poverty, Nepal is among the \n6. \npoorest countries in the world.7 Nepal has a population of 25 million in 4.8 million households, \nincluding  about  22  million  people  in  4  million  households  in  the  rural  sector.  The  rural  poor, \nestimated at 7.5 million in 4 million households, constitute about 95% of the poor in the country.  \nHistorically,  rural  poverty  has  been  associated  with  unemployment;  underemployment;  limited \nlandholdings; scarce non-land assets; low agricultural productivity; and lack of access to basic \nsocial  services,  social  capital,  and  economic  infrastructure.  Most  of  the  poor  are  (i)  farmers \ncultivating  low-value  crops  on  small  plots,  (ii)  workers  in  the  livestock  sector,  (iii)  workers  and \nself-employed  in  remote  areas,  and  (iv) landless  workers  in  low-wage  and  seasonal  activities. \nInsufficient access to productive resources, such as agricultural inputs, technology, and credit, \nis another important constraint to the rural poor breaking the vicious cycle of poverty.  \n \nAlthough  the  portion  of  people  living  in  poverty  dropped  from  42%  in  1996  to  31%  in \n7. \n2004,  poverty  has  declined  less  in  rural  areas8  than  in  urban  areas.  While  urban  poverty \ndeclined from 22% to 10%, rural poverty fell from 43% to 35% in the same period. The decline \nin  poverty  in  rural  areas\u2014though  less  dramatic  than  in  urban  areas\u2014was  mainly  the  result  of \ngrowth  before  1999,  when  the  rural  insurgency  was  less  pervasive.  A  marked  increase  in \noverseas employment from rural areas also contributed to the drop in poverty.  \n \n8. \nConflict Impact on Rural Poverty. For rural households, the conflict affected personal \nsecurity  and  movement  more  than  economic  and  productive  activities.  The  death  toll  between \nFebruary  1996  and  March  2006  reached  13,000.  By  October  2003,  the  number  of  internally \ndisplaced  persons  was  estimated  at  200,000.  Rural  households  also  suffered  from  illegal \nactivities,  such  as  extortion  and  land  confiscation.  Security  concerns  also  hampered  the \nGovernment\u2019s  ability  to  deliver  basic  services  and  development  projects.  A  conflict  impact \nassessment is in Supplementary Appendix B. \n \n\n                                                 \n5   The finance minister presented a  white  paper to the Parliament on 15 May 2006,  describing the macroeconomic \nrisks  and  proposing  short-term  measures  to  address  them.  These  included  more  effective  expenditure \nmanagement, strong revenue administration, and an interim economic program. \n\n6   In  the  statement  to  the  House  of  Representative  on  9  July  2006,  the  Prime  Minister  addressed  the  need  to  (i) \nremove  distortions  and  anomalies  in  the  financial  sector,  and  (ii)  carry  out  legal  and  institutional  reforms  of  the \nsector  to  increase  the  efficiency  of  the  rural  credit  market.  The  report  on  monetary  policy  for  FY2007  of  Nepal \nRastra Bank (NRB)\u2014the central bank\u2014emphasizes the need of legal and institutional reforms to expand the credit \nto rural areas. NRB. Monetary Policy for FY2006/2007. Kathmandu. \n\n7   Government of Nepal. 2005. Nepal Living Standards Survey Report 2003\u20132004. Kathmandu. \n8   The  official  poverty  line  is  NRs15,224  ($211)  per  capita  per  year  (consumption  expenditure  at  2004),  or  2,144 \n\ncalories per rural adult per day.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\f3. \n\nRural Finance Sector  \n\nOutreach.  Due \n\ninstitutional  capacity, \n\nto  historically  weak  governance  and \n\n \n9. \nthe \ndevelopment  of  the  rural  finance  (RF)  sector  in  Nepal  has  been  constrained  severely,  and  its \noutreach has been minuscule relative to the potential demand. An estimated 18 million people in \nNepal lack access to institutional financial services. While the supply of RF has been growing, \neven  during  the  conflict  (para.  15),  formal  institutional  RF  services  in  Nepal  meet  only  an \nestimated 10% of the potential demand in terms of lending volume. The combined outreach of \nformal  and  semiformal  sources  was  NRs2.6  billion  in  rural  credit  during  FY2005,  including \nNRs4.5  billion  of  agricultural  credit  to  927,000  households.  The  accessibility  to  RF  services  is \nparticularly  unfavorable  for  people  living  in  the  hills  and  mountains.  The  sector  analysis  is  in \nAppendix 1. \n \n10.  Market. The RF market in Nepal can be classified into three broad categories: (i) lower \nsegment\u2014about 35% of the rural households, comprising the landless and subsistence farmers; \n(ii)  middle  segment\u2014about  50%  of  the  rural  households, comprising  mainly  petty  traders,  and \nsmall and tenanted farmers; and (iii) upper segment\u2014commercial farms, medium-to-large farms \nand rural enterprises, and wholesalers of agriculture produce.  \n \n11. \nInstitutions.  Though  underdeveloped,  the  RF  sector  in  Nepal  has  a  range  of  financial \nservices, including microfinance.9 RF services in Nepal are provided by formal, semiformal, and \ninformal sources:10  \n\n \n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\ninstitutions.11  These \n\nFormal \ninclude  17  commercial  banks,  Agricultural \nDevelopment  Bank  Limited  (ADBL),12  five  Grameen  Bikash  Banks  (GBB) \n(Supplementary  Appendix  C),  47  microfinance  nongovernment  organizations \n(NGO),1311 private sector microfinance development banks (MFDB), 19 savings \nand credit cooperative societies, and Small Farmers Development Bank (SFDB) \n(Supplementary Appendix D).  \n\nSemiformal  institutions.  These  include  Government-sponsored  rural  credit \nprograms,  nearly  60  multisector  NGOs,  and  an  estimated  2,300  savings  and \ncredit cooperative societies.14  \n\nInformal  sources.  These  include  an  estimated  12,000  informal  community-\nbased  organizations  (CBO),  such  as  self-help  groups  and  informal  savings  and \ncredit organizations, traders, friends, relatives, and moneylenders.  \n\n                                                 \n9   Considering the demographics of Nepal, microfinance is primarily rural, even though microfinance institutions (MFI) \nalso  target  the  urban  poor.  RF,  including  microfinance,  as  described  in  this  document,  is  part  of  the  broader \nfinancial sector.  \n\n10  The wide range of RF providers has been given a broad classification for clarity. In this document, unless otherwise \nspecified,  RFIs  collectively  denote  all  formal  sources  other  than  commercial  banks,  and  the  semiformal  RFIs, \nincluding  microfinance  nongovernment  organizations.  The  term  RF  or  RFI,  thus,  includes  microfinance  or  MFIs, \nrespectively.  The  term  microfinance  or  MFI  is  used  only  for  specific  microfinance-related  references.  Likewise, \nwherever relevant, commercial banks are specifically mentioned.  \n\n11 Those  include  ones  supervised  by  NRB.  Nepal  has  63  supervised  finance  companies,  though  their  operations \n\nbarely reach the rural sector. \n\n12 This is the erstwhile Agricultural Development Bank of Nepal (ADBN), which was incorporated on 15 July 2005 as \npart of the RFSDCP reforms. Reference to ADBL in this document is made for discussing the issues with regard to \nADBN and the restructuring efforts of ADBL. \n\n13 NRB  permits  savings  and  credit  cooperative  societies  to  undertake  financial  intermediation.  The  Financial \nIntermediation Act of 1998 requires NGOs dealing with financial services to meet requirements specified by NRB \nfrom time to time. \n\n14 Those are registered under the Cooperatives Societies Act of 1996. \n\n3\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\n(iv) \n\nOther  institutions.  The  Rural  Microfinance  Development  Centre  (RMDC) \n(Supplementary  Appendix  E)\u2014a  microfinance  apex  organization\u2014provides \nrefinance and capacity-building support, mainly for microfinance NGOs.  \n\n \nIn  Nepal,  formal  institutions  are  the  main  providers  of  institutional  RF  services  (formal \n12. \nand  semiformal).  In  FY2005,  ADBL  accounted for  63%  of  rural  credit,  followed  by  commercial \nbanks at 26%. GBBs and MFDBs provided about 7% of the aggregated credit. The balance is \nfrom cooperatives and other semi-formal institutions. The key RFIs include: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nADBL.  The  Government  established  Agricultural  Development  Bank  of  Nepal \n(ADBN)  in  1968  to  specialize  in  agriculture  and  rural  credit.  As  part  of  the \nrestructuring,  it  was  incorporated  as  ADBL  in  2005.  ADBL  is  the  third  largest \nbank  in  Nepal15  with  paid-up  capital  of  NRs1.6  billion,  a  loan  portfolio  of  about \nNRs24 billion, deposits of NRs30 billion. It operates in all the 75 districts through \n300  branches  and  offices.  Under  the  pre-2005  structure,  the  Government  owns \n93% of the equity of ADBL, with the balance primarily owned by individuals. With \nan  asset  base  of  NRs42  billion,  ADBL  provides  short-,  medium-,  and  long-term \nloans to individual farmers, farmer groups, cooperatives, and village committees. \nIn addition, ADBL trains its beneficiaries. Besides the commercial and agriculture \noperations, it operates the Small Farmers Development Program (SFDP) through \nrefinancing  its  subsidiary,  SFDB.  Despite  its  institutional  weakness,  including \nhigh  nonperforming  loan  ratio  and  unsatisfactory  accounting  practices,  ADBL  is \nessential to RF service delivery in Nepal. With more than 500,000 borrowers and \ndepositors,  ADBL  is  the  single  most  important  institution  for  the  rural  sector. \nDetails of ADBL\u2019s operational and financial status are in Appendix 2. \n\nSFDB.  Established  in  2002,  SFDB  is  jointly  owned  by  ADBL,  the  Government, \ntwo  private  commercial  banks,  and  cooperatives.  SFDB  is  the  Implementing \nAgency  of  SFDP,  which  receives  funding  from  ADBL16  and  provides  funds  for \nmicrocredit for cooperatives of small farmers. SFDB acts as an apex  wholesale \nagency  to  small  farmer  cooperatives.  Due  to  its  weak  institutional  capacity, \nSFDB\u2019s outreach and impact are limited, with NRs480 million outstanding to 200 \nsmall farmer cooperatives. As a focus of the ADBL restructuring, SFDP financing \nwill  gradually  shift  from  ADBL  to  SFDB,  and  SFDB  is  to  be  strengthened  to \nmaintain focused financial services to small farmer cooperatives. SFDB is a key \ninstitution for promoting agriculture and microcredit in remote rural areas through \ncommunity-based  cooperatives  and  complements  ADBL  for  rural  small  farmer \noutreach. The institutional profile of SFDB is in Supplementary Appendix D. \n\nGBBs. Five GBBs were established in 1990s to provide microfinance services to \nthe  poor,  especially  poor  women,  through  a  group-based  methodology.  Nepal \nRastra Bank (NRB), commercial banks, and the Government jointly own GBBs.17 \nWith  a  network  of  146  branches,  mostly  in  remote  rural  areas,  GBBs  provide \nmicrofinance  services  to  approximately  200,000  clients.  However,  GBBs  also \ninefficiency,  and \nsuffer \noverstaffing, which have resulted in recurring losses, negative net worth, and low \n\nfrom  poor  governance,  politicization,  operational \n\n                                                 \n15  The two other largest banks in Nepal are: Nepal Bank Limited and Rastriya Banijya Bank.  \n16 ADB.1990.Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors  on  a  Proposed  Loan  and \nTechnical  Assistance  Grants  to  the  Kingdom  of  Nepal  for  the  Third  Small  Farmers  Development  Project.

Manila. \n\n17 NRB holds up to 10\u201375% equity of GBBs, commercial banks 20\u201325%, and Government 8\u201316%. \n\n \n\n \n\n\fproductivity.  In  line  with  the  financial  sector  reform,  the  Government  initiated  a \nrestructuring  of  GBBs.  Four  GBBs  were  recapitalized,  and  two  profit-making \nGBBs  were  privatized.  Given  the  shallow  markets  and  depressed  investor \nsentiment,  further  progress  in  divestment  is  expected  to  take  time.  The \ninstitutional profile of GBBs is in Supplementary Appendix C. \n\n(iv) \n\nCommercial  banks.  Commercial  banks\u2019  lending  to  the  rural  sector  constitutes \nabout 3% of their loan portfolio. Most of their rural lending is under the mandatory \npriority  sector  lending  requirements.  Within  the  commercial  banks,  the  private \ncommercial banks\u2019 exposure to retail rural credit is miniscule, except via indirect \nlending through GBBs and MFDBs. Due to the rationalization of their operations, \ncommercial banks closed many rural branches, and are reluctant to expand rural \noutreach due to the higher return of operations in urban areas.   \n\n \n13.   Demand.  The  average  size  of  rural  loans  to  non-poor  households  is  approximately \nNRs47,000,  compared  with  NRs8,400  to  the  poor  (or  microcredit  average).  The  aggregate \ndemand  for  rural  credit  from  all  sources  is  estimated  at  NRs24  billion,  of  which  microcredit  is \nabout NRs4 billion.18 The major credit demands are from small rural enterprises, and agriculture \nand  allied  sectors.  The  upper  market  segment  seeks  services  such  as  long-term  investment \ncapital.  The  middle  segment  requires  working  capital;  cash  credit;  loans  against  pledge  of \nproduce;  and  medium-  to  long-term  loans  for  crop  cultivation,  rural  transport,  and  land \ndevelopment.  The  lower  market  segment  requires  credit  for  consumption,  microenterprises, \ncrops, livestock, and minor irrigation.  \n \nAs  with  credit,  the  demand  for  savings  is  diverse.  It  comprises  self-finance  for \n14. \ninvestments,  livestock,  cash,  and  bank  deposits.  With  the  domestic  savings  to  GDP  ratio  at \n12%, the savings potential is immense. In addition, risk mitigation is widely needed. As Nepal \nreceived  nearly  $1  billion  in  remittances  in  2005,  a  significant  opportunity  exists  for  the  RF \nsector to tap into this market. \n \n15. \nRF Market and the Conflict. Despite the conflict, the demand for RF services remained \nstrong over the past decade. The number of households borrowing from all sources grew during \n1996\u20132005. Institutional credit also expanded, mainly because commercial banks have become \neven more reluctant to lend money in rural areas, while farmers\u2019 and microenterprises\u2019 demand \nfor financial services has not waned. Throughout the conflict, ADBL kept open its 45 commercial \nbanking  branches,  as  well  as  108  out  of  181  development  banking  branches  at  original \nlocations.  Security  concerns,  especially  in  the  western  region,  have  required  80  development \nbanking branches to be relocated or merged with branches at secure areas. Still, ADBL\u2019s overall \ntransaction  grew  steadily  from  NRs8.9  billion  loans  outstanding  in  FY1996  to  NRs24  billion  in \nFY2006.19 Total deposits also grew from NRs8.6 billion in FY1996 to NRs30 billion in FY2006. \nClients have been willing to commute to relocated branches, given the acute lack of affordable \ncredit sources. MFDBs and microfinance NGOs also have received increased client interest. In \ncontrast,  most  of  the  rural  savings  with  commercial  banks  were  deployed  in  urban  and  semi-\nurban areas.  \n \n\n                                                 \n18  ADB.1999.  Rural  Finance  Development  in  Nepal:  A  Medium-Term  Strategy.  Manila.  The  estimates  have  been \n\n \n \n \n\ninflation adjusted. \n19  By mid-July 2006. \n\n5\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\nB. \n\nIssues and Opportunities  \n\n1. \n\n \nSector Challenges \n \n\ninterventions  by \n\nthe  Government  weakened \n\nEfficient  and  reliable  financial  intermediaries  are  essential  to  equitable  and  pro-poor-\n16. \noriented  rural  economic  growth  and  development.  Access  to  affordable  institutional  financial \nservices is crucial for the rural poor to take advantage of the opportunities engendered by the \npeace  process.  Systematic  intervention  to  induce  rapid  outreach  expansion  of  institutional  RF \nservices, combined with policy and institutional reforms, is required urgently. Yet, the policy and \ninstitutional framework of the RF sector in Nepal is still too weak to quickly respond to changing \nmarket  conditions  to  meet  the  demands  of  the  recovering  rural  economy.  The  key  sector \nconstraints are as follows:  \n \n17. \nHistorical  Politicization  in  RF.  The  fundamental  weakness  in  RF  in  Nepal  is  political \ninterference in lending, loan collection, and loan write-offs. The Government has intervened in \nthe RF market to increase lending by reducing the costs and risks for RFIs in making loans to \ninstitutional \npreferred  clients.  Prolonged \nsustainability of RFIs.  \n \n18. \nLimited Financial Prospect for Private Sector Participation. Extensive politicization, \nrepressive  policies,  and  market  distortions  failed  to  create  conditions  that  are  conductive  to \nprivate sector-led RF market development. The high-risk profile in RF, cost considerations, and \ndifficult  topographical  conditions  deter  private  financial  institutions  from  entering  the  market. \nAlthough  cooperatives  and  microfinance  NGOs  remained  active  during  the  conflict,  their \noutreach  is  minuscule.  The  condition  of  the  RF  market  provides  little  alternative  than  to \nstrengthen existing formal RFI channels.  \n \n19.  Weak  Institutional  Capacity.  The  evolution  of  the  RF  market  over  the  past  three \ndecades  was  supply-driven  to  accelerate  agriculture  production.  Thus,  the  development  of \nefficient  institutions  was  ignored.  The  Government  intervened  through  directed  credit,  state-\nowned  RFIs,  concessional  refinance,  and  loans  at  below-cost  interest  rates.  Repressive \nfinancial  policies,  with  the  lack  of  autonomy  and  weak  governance,  eroded  institutional \nsustainability  and  constrained  outreach  potential.  The  capacity  of  formal  RFIs  in  Nepal  for \nportfolio management, accounting and reporting, business planning, and risk mitigation is below \ninternational best practices of RF. \n \nErosion in RFI Confidence. Most formal financial institutions were reluctant to operate \n20. \nin  rural  areas  due  to  the  fragile  security  situation  and  high  costs.  In  recent  years,  the  most \naffected  commercial  banks  have  reduced  the  size  of  their  rural  networks,  which  already  had \nbeen scaled down by cost-saving measures. This has added to the current financial difficulties. \nCooperatives  and  savings  associations  were  less  affected  by  the  conflict,  though  interest \nwaivers or reductions in interest eroded their financial viability.  \n \n21.  Weak  Supervisory  and  Regulatory  Framework.  While  RFIs  proliferated,  supervision \nremained  weak  and  ineffective.  Although  most  semiformal  RFIs,  especially  cooperatives, \nmobilize  non-member  savings,  they  remain  inadequately  supervised.  The  enactment  of  Banks \nand  Financial  Institutions  Ordinance  (BFIO)  200420  and  NRB  Act  2002  defragmented  the \n\n                                                 \n20 Enacted in December 2003, BFIO supersedes the Agricultural Development Bank Act 1967, Commercial Bank Act \nof  1974,  Nepal  Industrial  Development  Bank  Act  1967,  Finance  Company  Act  1985,  and  Development  Bank  Act \n1995.  As  an  ordinance,  BFIO  is  promulgated  every  6  months,  and  it  is  expected  that  Parliament\u2014in  its  next \nsession\u2014probably will approve the transformation of the ordinance into an act.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\fbanking sector and gave greater autonomy to NRB.21 However, supervising many small RFIs is \nnot  cost-effective,  and  should  be  the  focus  of  NRB.  An  effective  supervision  and  regulatory \nsystem must be developed. \n \nLimited  Product  Diversification.  Leasing  and  insurance  services  have  not  made  an \n22. \nimpact  in  rural  areas  because  of  (i)  limited  opportunities  for  viable  operations,  (ii)  scant  client \ninformation  to  assess  risks,  (iii)  high  administrative  costs  due  to  widely  dispersed  clients,  and \n(iv) weak contract enforcement. A sustainable mechanism for crop and calamity insurance has \nnot  emerged  due  to  the  difficulties  of  asymmetric  information  and  coverage  of  risks,  while  the \ndemand  for  effective  risk  mitigation  products  is  strong.  Remittance,  term  deposits,  and  other \nsavings  facilities  also  have  little  presence  in  rural  areas,  forcing  rural  people  to  depend  on \ninformal means to save and remit money.  \n \n23. \nInsufficient  Sector  Support  Infrastructure.  Affordable,  high-quality  training  for \nmainstreaming  RF  best  practices  is  lacking.  Curricula  and  training  courses  in  banking  and \nfinancial  products  offered  at  universities  are  inconsistent  with  best  practices  in  banking  and \nfinance, and specialization for RF is rare or nonexistent. Further, semiformal RFIs are unaware \nof  their  need  for  such  training.  The  training  needs  of  the  RF  sector,  including  those  of  policy \nmakers and regulators, will have to be supported for effective institutional reform. \n \n\nthose  agricultural \n\nLessons Learned \n\n2. \n \n24. \nLessons from ADB RF and Microfinance Projects. ADB has financed numerous loan \nand  TA  projects  in  RF.  In  most  of  the  projects,  ADB  has  extended  credit  line  assistance  as  a \nstand-alone credit project, or as components of projects generally in the agriculture and natural \nresources  sector.  RF  projects  in  the  early  1990s  generally  were  poorly  targeted,  with  little \nattention  paid  to  financial  viability.  Typical  projects22  were  assistance  to  ADBN,23  Bangladesh \nKrishi  Bank,  and  Bank  for  Agriculture  and  Agricultural  Cooperative  (BAAC)  in  Thailand. \nloaded  with  Government-directed \nHowever, \nsubsidized  credit  programs,  and  ADB  financing  often  supported  the  Government  programs. \nSuch  directed  programs  have  not  induced  a  good  credit  culture,  and  the  institutions  suffered \nfrom  low  repayment.  Further,  ADB  funding  to  those  projects  was  disbursed  slowly.  Prevailing \nGovernment policies largely influenced subsequent sustainability of those RF and microfinance \nprojects.  Institutions  that  operated  in  a  policy  environment  that  did  not  encourage  self-\nsupporting  operations  have  continued  to  suffer  low  recovery  rates,  and  have  required \nrecapitalization by the Government, as in the cases of ADBN and Bangladesh Krishi Bank.  \n \n25. \nHowever, the institutions that have been reformed (even without an explicit privatization \nexit)  and  allowed  to  operate  with  market-oriented  interest  rates  have  improved  their  ability  to \nmobilize  resources  and  become  self-sustaining  institutions.  BAAC  is  fully  Government  owned, \nand  its  operation  had  been  staggered  over  more  than  30  years.  Before  the  reform,  BAAC \n\ninstitutions  were \n\nlending \n\n                                                 \n21 As  part  of  NRB  reengineering  through  the  ongoing  World  Bank-funded  Financial  Sector  Technical  Assistance \nProject,  and  TA  3580\u2013NEP:  Subcluster  3:  Institutional  Strengthening  of  Nepal  Rastra  Bank  for  Regulation  and \nSupervision  of  Rural  Finance,  for  $800,000,  approved  on  27  August  2002.

Manila (Loan 1112-\nNEP, approved on 31 October). \n\n23 As part of the restructuring, the erstwhile ADBN was incorporated as ADBL in July 2005.  \n\n7\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\ndepended  almost  exclusively  on  capital  from  the  Government,  and  its  repayment  rate  was  as \nlow  as  51%.  In  1975,  the  Government  of  Thailand  initiated  agriculture  sector  reforms,  and \nremoved interest rate ceiling and other restrictive regulations of agricultural finance. BAAC was \nplaced under the supervision of the Bank of Thailand. The organization and operation of BAAC \nalso  were  reformed,  including  clearing  nonperforming  loans,  mobilizing  commercial  deposits, \nand expanding retail outreach. By 1998, BAAC had 4.8 million clients, representing 86% of the \nfarm households of the country. BAAC\u2019s example suggests that the reform of agricultural banks \nis feasible, and that their financial performance and outreach can be improved greatly. However, \nsuch reforms must be implemented in connection with the development of an enabling financial \nsector  environment,  including  (i)  appropriate  legal  and  regulatory  framework,  (ii)  prudential \nnorms  and  effective  internal  control,  and  (iii)  genuine  commitment  to  profitability  and \nsustainability of operations.24 \n \n26. \nLessons  from  ADB\u2019s  Nepal  Operations.  An  assessment  in  July  2006  found  that  the \nsecurity situation had not seriously affected 13 (57%) of the 23 ongoing ADB-assisted projects \nin Nepal, while 10 (43%) had been moderately affected and zero (0%) had been highly affected. \nThe limited impact on the projects was mainly because the disruptions were time- and location-\nspecific.  Project  designs  were  based  on  participatory  and  community-based  activities,  which \nenabled  them  to  continue  effectively  and  safely,  even  in  the  unstable  environment.  More \nimprovements are expected as the peace process progresses and the ceasefire endures. This \nindicates that projects with effective links with CBOs, and flexibility in intervention areas, can be \nimplemented  safely  and  achieve  the  expected  results.  RMDC,  which  is  supported  under  the \nADB-funded  Rural  Microfinance  Project,25  provides  loans  to  microfinance  institutions  (MFI)  to \nonlend to women rural borrowers. Despite the security situation, RMDC\u2019s loan disbursement to \nMFIs substantially grew during the conflict, and had served more than 280,000 poor women in \nrural areas as of July 2006. \n \n\n3. \n\nGovernment Strategy \n\n \n27. \nGiven  recent  political  developments,  the  Government  has  adopted  a  two-pronged \napproach  to  development\u2014conducting  serious  peace  talks,  while  maintaining  focus  on  reform \nand economic recovery and development. Rural investment and improvement of the livelihoods \nof  the  rural  poor  are  the  top  priorities  in  the  Government\u2019s  FY2007  budget.  This  is  a  keen \nrecognition  that  social  economic  benefits  need  to  be  delivered  quickly  to  the  rural  poor.  The \nGovernment\u2019s strategy is to address the root causes of the conflict, specifically social exclusion \nand  large  urban-rural  and  regional  disparities.  At  the  same  time,  the  Government  has  been \nreinvigorating  the  reform  process  in  areas  such  as  civil  service,  corporate  governance,  and \nlabor ordinances.26 The Government concedes that undertaking fundamental reforms requiring \nmajor  legislative  changes  and  institutional  restructuring  would  be  difficult  in  the  prevailing \n\n                                                 \n24  BAAC  underwent  comprehensive  reform  in  the  late  1980s  and  1990s,  including  interest  rate  liberalization, \nrationalization  of  loss-incurring  operations,  and  savings  mobilization.  BAAC\u2019s  transformation  is  considered  a \nsuccessful example of the restructuring of agricultural banks, along with Bank Rakyat Indonesia (BRI). BAAC and \nBRI are state-owned.

Manila. \n\n26  As  part  of  the  reform,  a  new  labor  ordinance  has  been  promulgated,  a  new  governance  ordinance  and  a \nprocurement ordinance have been endorsed by the cabinet, and oil prices and distribution have been deregulated, \nsubstantially fulfilling the outstanding reform conditions under the World Bank\u2019s Poverty Reduction Support Credit II \nand the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility of the International Monetary Fund. \n\n \n\n \n\n\fpolitical  environment.  However,  it  has  made  a  strong  commitment  to  maintaining  continuity  of \nreform policies, despite potentially difficult reform environments (para. 5 and footnote 6). \n \n28. \nThe Government adopted the Financial Sector Strategy Statement in 2000 to (i) reduce \nthe role of the Government in the financial sector, (ii) improve governance and transparency, (iii) \nstrengthen the authority of NRB, (iv) enhance the legal framework for credit enforcement, and \n(v)  expand  the  availability  of  financial  services  in  remote  areas.  The  Government  has \ndemonstrated  its  commitment  to  banking  reforms  by  enacting  BFIO  2004  (footnote  21);  and \npromulgating the Company Law, and laws for secured transactions, securities, and insolvency.27 \nThe mandatory priority sector credit lending quota for banks also will be phased out by the end \nof 2007.28 The Tenth Plan (FY2002\u2013FY2007)29\u2014the Government\u2019s Poverty Reduction Strategy \nPaper\u2014highlights  the  need  to  address  chronic  poverty  and  social  exclusion.  To  meet  RF \ndemands  for  post-conflict  rehabilitation,  the  Government  is  keen  to  enlarge  the  network  for \nsustainable RFIs to significantly enhance outreach to small and marginal farmers and the poor.  \n \n\n4. \n\nADB Strategy \n\n \nADB\u2019s Microfinance and RF Strategy. ADB\u2019s Microfinance Development Strategy30 is \n29. \nto  ensure  permanent  access  to  institutional  financial  services  for  a  majority  of  poor  and  low-\nincome households, and their microenterprises. The strategy specifically focuses on (i) creating \na  policy  environment  enabling  to  microfinance,  (ii)  developing  the  financial  infrastructure,  (iii) \nbuilding  viable  institutions,  (iv)  supporting  pro-poor  innovations,  and  (v)  supporting  social \nintermediation. Under the strategy, ADB will catalyze the expansion of microfinance supply, as \nwell as strengthen the capacity of the potential clients to access services. On the supply side, \nthe strategy focuses on building financial systems that can grow and provide financial services \npermanently to an increasing proportion of the poor, and on promotion of pro-poor innovations. \nFurther,  the  strategy  emphasizes  support  for  the  reform  of  agricultural  and  rural  development \nbanks in countries, where those institutions continue to undermine development of sustainable \nmicrofinance/RF operations. \n \n30. \nADB\u2019s Operational Strategy in Nepal. ADB\u2019s Country Strategy and Program for Nepal \n(2005\u20132009)31 focuses on (i) pro-poor and broad-based economic growth, and inclusive social \nand  human  development;  (ii)  empowerment  of  the  poor;  and  (iii)  good  governance  to  ease \nsocial tensions and create the foundation for sustainable poverty reduction. The primary aim is \nto improve access for the poor and those excluded from markets and economic opportunities. \nADB\u2019s new operational approach32 in Nepal endorses continued engagement in the country with \na  cautious,  conflict-sensitive  approach,  and  close  monitoring  of  the  evolving  situation  in \ncollaboration  with  other  development  partners.  With  this  approach,  projects  and  programs  will \nbe  developed  based  on  the  political  and  security  assessments  of  the  implementation \n\n                                                 \n27 These laws are covered under ADB. 2000.

The strategy defines microfinance \nas  \u201cthe  provision  of  a  broad  range  of  financial  services  such  as  deposits,  loans,  payment  services,  money \ntransfers, and insurance to poor and low-income households, and their microenterprises\u201d. The definition largely is \nconsistent with the one for RF in the RFSDCP context. \n31  ADB. 2004. Country Strategy and Program Nepal. Manila. \n32  The  President  of  ADB  approved  the  new  operational  approach  in  Nepal  on  26  May  2006.  The  new  approach \nproposes continued engagement in Nepal through cautious and conflict-sensitive approach, priority in rural finance \nand road connectivity, and review in governance and public policy reform interventions. \n\n9\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\nenvironment,  with  risk  mitigation  measures  incorporated  as  appropriate.  RFSDCP  is  identified \nas  a  priority  intervention  due  to  its  rural  and  community  focus,  as  well  as  its  high  potential  to \ndeliver expected development results in the current political and security environment.  \n \n\n5. \n\nExternal Assistance to the Sector \n\n \n31. \nThe  funding  agency  community  welcomed  the  recent  political  development  as  a  step \ntoward a peaceful solution to the conflict. Funding agencies, which had suspended or reduced \ntheir  assistance  since  early  2005,  have  resumed  their  operations,  or  are  scaling  up  to  2003\u2013\n2004 levels (when the country was less politically unstable). While taking a cautious approach, \nfunding agencies believe harmonized and coordinated assistance for rural development, power, \nwater  supply  and  sanitation,  education  and  health,  and  infrastructure  will  benefit  the  country\u2019s \npeace-building, reform, and development. \n \n32. \nThe  International  Monetary  Fund\u2019s  Poverty  Reduction  and  Growth  Facility  expires  in \nNovember  2006.  Given  the  generally  pro-poor  orientation  of  the  FY2007  budget,  the \ncontinuation  of  this  facility  generally  is  perceived  to  be  preferable,  because  it  will  support  the \npeace process and stabilize the fragile political situation. The World Bank supports the Financial \nSector  Restructuring  Project33  to  develop  a  healthier  financial  sector  with  emphasis  on  private \nsector participation. The key component of the project is the reform and divestment of the two \nlargest  commercial  banks,  Rastriya  Banijya  Bank  and  Nepal  Bank  Limited.34  Since  the \nGovernment  has  endorsed  a  new  labor  ordinance,  governance  ordinance,  and  procurement \nordinance, World Bank is expected to release its Poverty Reduction Support Credit II. German \ndevelopment  cooperation,  through  Gesellschaft  f\u00fcr  Technische  Zusammenarbeit  (GTZ), \nimplements the Rural Finance in Nepal Project to develop community-based financial services \nthrough  capacity  development  of  small  farmer  cooperatives.  As  cooperatives  are  essential  to \nmaintaining access to financial services for small and marginal farmers in rural areas, GTZ will \ncontinue to support the small farmer cooperatives and finance capacity development for SFDB \nin parallel with RFSDCP. The development coordination matrix is in Appendix 3. \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED SECTOR DEVELOPMENT CLUSTER PROGRAM \n\n1. \n\nRationale \n\nThe Program Loan \n\n \nA. \n \n \n \n33. \nAs the peace process is now largely on track, reducing rural poverty by addressing rural-\nurban  income  disparity,  limited  access  to  economic  resources,  and  social  exclusion  is  widely \nregarded  as  the  key  to  lasting  peace  and  development.  Increased  financial  intermediation  will \nenable the heavier flow of resources to the rural sector, as well as give RF clients opportunities \nto  improve  their  incomes  and  reconstruct  their  livelihoods.  This  will  contribute  to  political  and \neconomic  stability  in  rural  areas.  The  scarcity  of  institutional  financial  services  in  rural  areas, \ncaused by the historic politicization and institutional weaknesses, constrains the achievement of \n\n                                                 \n33  World Bank. 2004. Financial Sector Restructuring Project. Washington, DC (International Development Agency, for \n\n$75 million, approved on 9 March). \n\n34  Rastriya  Banijya  Bank  is  a  fully  state-owned  bank,  while  Nepal  Bank  Limited  is  a  private  institute  with  the \n\nGovernment as the largest shareholder (41%). \n\n \n\n \n\n\finclusive social and economic development in rural areas. Rural credit facilities throughout the \ncountry need to be expanded by restructuring RFIs.35  \n \n34. \nDeveloping the RF sector for outreach impact requires an integrated package of policy \nand  institutional  strengthening  measures.  A  sector  development  cluster  program  approach  will \nfacilitate  comprehensive  reforms,  with  specific  policy  and  institutional  reform  targets,  while \nenabling flexible reforms according to changing political and economic conditions. \n \n\n2. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n35. \nImpact  and  Outcome.  The  goals  of  the  cluster  program\u2014RFSDCP\u2014are  to  (i)  ensure \nsustainable  access  of  rural  households  to  institutional  financial  services,  and  (ii)  encourage \nprivate  sector  participation  in  the  RF  sector.  The  objective  is  to  develop  a  sustainable  RF \nsystem  for  providing  affordable  services  to  the  rural  poor  to  generate  income  and  reduce \npoverty.  The  scope  is  comprehensive  RF  sector  development,  mainly  through  enabling  sector \npolicy environment and institutional reform, and restructuring of major RFIs.  \n \n36. \nApplication  of  Program  Cluster  Modality.  As  the  reforms  are  comprehensive  and \ninterlinked, and the institutional reform process will unfold over the medium term, RFSDCP will \nbe  structured  in  sequential  subprograms  under  the  program  cluster  modality.  Under  this \nmodality, each subprogram will be implemented over 2 years. Subprogram II will be formulated \nand  finalized  during  the  subprogram  review  (SPR)  immediately  following  the  completion  of \nsubprogram I. This will allow the flexibility to adjust the program based on progress made and \nchanges  in  the  external  environment,  and  will  build  momentum  in  the  reform  process  as  the \nGovernment  gains  experience  through  implementation.  However,  the  SPR  does  not  obligate \nADB  to  additional  lending  for  subprogram  II  under  RFSDCP.  Subprogram  II  will  be  subject  to \nADB\u2019s Board approval. \n \nSubprogram  Objectives.  The  objective  of  subprogram  I  of  RFSDCP  is  to  develop  an \n37. \nenabling  RF  sector  framework  through  policy,  legal,  regulatory,  and  institutional  reforms.  The \nobjective of subprogram II will be to promote further reform for an enabling sector environment, \nenhance  sound  RF  outreach,  and  private  sector  participation  in  RF.  Subprogram  II  will  focus \nstrongly  on  the  privatization  of  RFIs,  including  ADBL.  For  each  subprogram,  achievement \ntargets will be formulated to keep the reform process on track and coordinated. The targets for \ntranche release under the subprogram, as well as indicative targets under subprogram II, are in \nthe policy matrix attached to the Government\u2019s development policy letter (Appendix 4). \n \n38. \nThe RFSDCP Subprogram I Structure. Subprogram I consists of a program loan and \nan ADF grant. The counterpart funds to be generated out of the proceeds of the program loan \nwill be used to recapitalize ADBL through subscription of ADBL\u2019s preference shares, which will \nbe  divided  between  redeemable  and  irredeemable  shares.  The  ADF  grant  will  support  the \nimplementation  of  the  institutional  reforms,  legal  and  regulatory  framework,  sector  capacity \nbuilding,  product  and  process  innovation,  and  project  management.  The  agreements  on \nRFSDCP  are  reflected  in  the  Government\u2019s  development  policy  letter  and  the  attached  policy \nmatrix  and  RF  sector  road  map  (Appendix  4).  The  design  and  monitoring  framework  is  in \nAppendix 5. \n\n                                                 \n35 The  rural  development  impact  of  RFSDCP  will  complement  strongly  the  Commercial  Agriculture  Development \nProject  (being  processed),  which  promotes  local  infrastructure  investment,  production,  and  marketing  support  for \nagriculture-related enterprises. The Project will support local infrastructure development, such as storage centers, \ncool  stores,  access  to  market  information,  and  agribusiness  product  improvement  technology.  It  also  will  assist \nsubsistence and semi-commercial producers for commercialization of their businesses. \n\n11\n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\f12 \n\n \n\nComponents and Outputs  \n\n3. \n \n39. \nRFSDCP  has  five  components:  (i)  favorable  policy  environment,  (ii) institutional \nrestructuring  and  reforms,  (iii)  supportive  legal  and  regulatory  framework,  (iv) sector  capacity \nbuilding, and (v) product and process innovations.  \n \n\n \n\na. \n\nFavorable Policy Environment \n\nThe \n\nfinancial  sector  reforms \n\n \nto  develop  a  market-oriented  and \nin  Nepal  aim \n40. \npredominantly privately owned financial sector for efficient financial intermediation.36 Consistent \nwith  the  financial  sector  reform,  a  high-level  policy  review  committee  will  be  established  to \nsupport RF policy reform actions (paras. 41\u201342).37  \n  \n41. \n \n\nThe following reforms will be completed under subprogram I: \n\n(i) \n\nestablishing rules, regulations, and processes for the supervision and regulation \nof RFIs;  \ndivesting NRB shares in RFIs to the legally defined level; \nphasing out Government ownership of technically insolvent RFIs; and \ndiscontinuing the application of interest rate ceilings to ADBL and SFDB.  \n\n(ii) \n(iii) \n(iv) \n \nThe following reforms will be pursued throughout RFSDCP: \n \n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n\nensuring the full enforcement of the debt recovery law for willful defaulters; \npromoting lending from formal and semiformal RFIs to CBOs; \ndivesting  the  Government  shares  and  increasing  participation  of  the  private \nsector in ADBL and SFDB; and \ndiscontinuing  Government  interventions  in  ADBL  and  SFDB  to  implement \nfinancially or economically unsound concessions, write-offs, or waivers. \n\n42. \n\n(iv) \n\n \n\n \n\nb. \n\nInstitutional Restructuring and Reforms  \n\n \nADBL. RFSDCP supports reform and restructuring of ADBL to transform it into a viable \n43. \nand efficient RFI relevant to rural poverty reduction. The restructuring under RFSDCP will focus \non  the  progressive  divestment  of  the  Government  shares  of  ADBL,  which  is  linked  to \nperformance  improvement  and  commercialization  to  enable  the  privatization  of  ADBL  under \nsubprogram  II  (Appendix  4).  The  Government  has  initiated  a  series  of  reforms,  which  have \nincluded (i) the Government\u2019s adoption of the ADBL Restructuring Plan (ARP) (Supplementary \nAppendix F) in 2004, and the conversion of $65 million of the Government\u2019s debt to ADBL into \npreference shares of ADBL for recapitalization; and (ii) ADBL\u2019s incorporation and licensing as a \nclass  A  financial  institution  under  BFIO.  These  reforms  are  part  of  the  first  tranche  release \nconditions (Appendix 4). The restructuring of ADBL is detailed in the ARP. \n \n44. \nImportant  reform  output  targets  under  subprogram  I  are  (i)  divestment  of  Government \nshares, (ii) initiation of the initial public offering (IPO), (iii) completion of a voluntary retirement \nscheme, and (iv) attainment of viable operations by meeting performance indicators set under \nARP. Subprogram II aims to (i) achieve privatization, (ii) complete the implementation of ARP, \nand (iii) divest equity in SFDB. Reform targets under each subprogram are in the policy matrix \n(Appendix 4). The following reform areas are covered throughout subprograms I and II: \n                                                 \n36 Government of Nepal. 2000. Financial Sector Strategy Statement. Kathmandu. \n37  A policy review committee will be made up of representatives from NRB, Ministry of Finance, and private RFIs. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n(i) \n\n13\n\nGovernance. Restructuring will promote sound and autonomous management at \nADBL. To enhance the governance of ADBL, substantial restructuring steps have \nbeen taken: (a) incorporation of ADBL under the Company Law 1997 on 15 July \n2005,  (b)  formation  of  the  governance  committee  and  audit  committee  in \naccordance with regulatory requirements, and (c) licensing of ADBL as a class A \nfinancial institution under BFIO to enable it to operate as a universal bank under \nthe  supervision  and  regulation  by  NRB.  In  addition,  a  professional  board  of \ndirectors, with three of the seven members from private sector, will be constituted \nas the divestment progresses. \n\nFinancial  restructuring.  RFSDCP  supports  the  financial  restructuring  of  ADBL \nto facilitate divestment and privatization. First, ADBL will be recapitalized to cover \nbad  and  doubtful  debts,  estimated  at  NRs8.42  billion,  to  ensure  that  capital \nadequacy  of  ADBL  remains  above  12%, \nthe  NRB \nrequirement. Second, the issued capital of NRs11.2 billion will be subscribed in \nphases, with an initial NRs6.5 billion filled by the current equity of NRs1.6 billion \nand  conversion  of  NRs4.9  billion  of  the  Government\u2019s  debt  to  ADBL  equity \n(preference  shares).38  The  Government  also  has  bought  NRs30  million  of  NRB \nequity.  The  Government  will  subscribe  to  the  balance  as  redeemable  and \nirredeemable  preference  shares  for  the  duration  of  RFSDCP,  provided  ADBL \nmeets  agreed  performance  benchmarks.39  Detailed  financial  analysis  and \nprojections of ADBL are in Supplementary Appendix G. \n\nin  accordance  with \n\nOrganization.  Restructuring  will  promote  a  lean  and  efficient  organization \nstructure  of  ADBL.  ADBL  operations  will  be  decentralized  under  a  regional \nbusiness center structure. Seven regional business centers will be established as \nprofit centers, offering products and services that are best suited to the needs of \nthe local market. The structure will enable subordinate outlets to attend to clients\u2019 \nneeds proactively, thereby delivering quality and raising productivity. The reform \nalso  will  strengthen  significantly  human  resource  management.  Staff  members, \nwhose skills sets do not meet the new requirements, will be phased out gradually \nthrough  voluntary  separation  schemes  with  adequate  compensation.  About  350 \nstaff  members,  approximately  15%  of  the  total,  have  opted  for  voluntary \nseparation.  Clear  benchmarks  will  be  established  to  link  staff  compensation  to \ntheir  performances.  In  addition,  a  transparent  recruitment  and  appointment \nprocess will be in place. \n\nInstitutional strengthening. The monitoring and reporting system of ADBL will \nbe upgraded through an improved management information system (MIS) in line \nwith international best practice.   \n\nBusiness  strategy.  The  new  business  plan  of  ADBL  will  be  developed  to  set \nspecific operational targets through improved business processes. The aim is to \nreach 565,000 clients40 by 2011 (compared with the current 430,000 clients) by \nadopting  efficient  practices.  Risk  will  be  kept  within  acceptable  levels  by \nundertaking  due  diligence  in  loan  appraisal,  and  meeting  prudential  norms. \nManagement  and  control  of  risks,  especially  delinquency,  will  be  strengthened. \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n                                                 \n38 This mainly includes non-recoverable loans approved according to Government directives.  \n39  On  16  March  2005,  the  Government  issued  a  cabinet  resolution  to  invest  NRs2.3  billion  as  the  redeemable  and \n\nirredeemable preference shares in ADBL as the initial recapitalization. \n\n40  In terms of active accounts. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f14 \n\n \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\nLending  will  come  from  repayments  and  deposit  mobilization  until  ADBL \nsignificantly improves its repayment rate.  \n\nPerformance benchmarking. The progress of the restructuring will be evaluated \nbased on agreed performance indicators (Appendix 2, Table A2.4) to ensure that \nADBL\u2019s operations are turned around successfully and sustainable.  \n\nPrivatization.  The  restructuring  incorporates  the  privatization  of  ADBL  through \nphased  divestment  of  the  Government  shares. BFIO  requires  the  public  to  hold \n30% of all financial institutions. Accordingly, ADBL will be required to undertake \nan  IPO  in  consultation  with  ADB,  Ministry  of  Finance  (MOF),  and  NRB.41  In \naddition,  the  existing  500,000  general  shareholders  (mostly  clients)  also  will  be \ngiven  the  option  to  buy  additional  shares.  These  will  be  the  basis  for  further \ndivestment of Government shares, and privatization during subprogram II.42  \n\n(viii)  Anticorruption.  Restructuring  also  will  address  corruption  issues  within  ADBL. \nADBL  has  set  up  an  anticorruption  and  complaints  cell  to  support  the  audit \ncommittee of ADBL in tracking and minimizing corruption. In addition, measures \nto  minimize  corruption  risks  have  been  identified  and  incorporated  in  the \nrestructuring  process,  including  adoption  of  the  code  of  conduct,  strengthening \nauditing system, and ensuring accountability at each level of ADBL operations. \n\n \n45. \nSFDB.  SFDB  and  small  farmer  cooperatives  will  be  strengthened  substantially  to \nsupplement  ADBL\u2019s  efforts  to  ensure  that  agriculture  credit  needs  of  small  farmers  are  met \nadequately  in  areas  that  commercial  banks  do  not  consider  viable.  In  addition,  the \ntransformation  of  SFDP  into  small  farmer  cooperatives\u2014and  their  links  with  SFDB\u2014will  be \nredesigned  for  expediting  outreach  to  small  farmers  and  local  communities.43  Based  on  the \ndiagnostic review of SFDB,44 an SFDB restructuring plan will be developed to enhance SFDB\u2019s \nviability  and  outreach  to  small  farmer  cooperatives  with  specific  performance  indicators.  The \nrestructuring  assistance  will  prioritize  strengthening  SFDB\u2019s  microfinance  and  banking \noperations, staff capacity building, and accounting and auditing. The reform output targets under \nsubprogram I will be (i) adoption of the SFDB restructuring plan, (ii) initiation of the restructuring \nprocess, and (iii) partial divestment of Government shares to the legally required level as set out \nin  BFIO.  The  subprogram  II  reforms  are  expected  to  achieve  viable  operations  by  meeting \nperformance indicators of the SFDB restructuring plan, and privatization. \n \n\n                                                 \n41 The  sale  of  NRB  stake  in  GBBs  has  not  progressed  substantially  due  to  inadequate  investor  response  and \n\ndepressed market sentiment.  \n\n42 The  Government  owns  65%  of  the  ordinary  shares  of  the  issued  capital  of  ADBL,  amounting  to  NRs1.63  billion \n(with  voting  rights).  ADBL  will  undertake  an  IPO  of  ordinary  shares  worth  NRs870  million  to  enable  the  public  to \nown 35% of ADBL (30% as required by BFIO, and 5% to the existing public shareholders of ADBN). The balance \nof the issued capital will be divided into redeemable and irredeemable preference shares (non-voting). Subscription \nof  non-voting  preference  shares  by  the  Government  is  a  credible  demonstration  to  potential  investors  of \nGovernment\u2019s  intention  to  fill  financial  gaps  of  ADBL,  for  which  it  is  directly  and  indirectly  responsible.  This  is \nintended  to  facilitate  private  sector  interest  in  ADBL.  BFIO\u2019s  provision  on  reduction  of  issued  capital  could  be \napplied to reducing the preference shares held by the Government with improvements in ADBL performance. The \nprivatization  of  ADBL  is  conditional  upon  the  successful  turnaround  of  ADBL  into  a  viable  commercial  institution \nduring subprogram I. The privatization plan will be developed under subprogram II. \n\n43  Lessons  learned  in  RF  sector  reforms  in  Sri  Lanka  will  be  applied  to  outreach  in  districts  severely  affected  by \nconflict.

Governance, institutional, and financial issues left unaddressed for a long period \n46. \nhave  reduced  significantly  the  potential  service  delivery  capacity  of  GBBs.  The  RFSDCP \nreforms  will  support  the  completion  of  GBB  divestment.  The  recapitalization  support  for  viable \nGBBs will be considered under subprogram II, subject to the SPR. \n \n \n \n47. \nThe  Government  will  consolidate  the  fragmented  and  ineffective  supervisory  and \nregulatory mechanisms for all financial intermediation entities that are not supervised by NRB. \nThis process is required to address the concerns regarding proliferating cooperatives and RFIs \nthat  are  supervised  and  regulated  ineffectively.  RFSDCP  supports  the  development  and \nadoption  of  an  appropriate  supervision  and  regulation  system  for  RFIs  that  would  remain \noutside  BFIO.45  The  output  targets  under  subprogram  I  are  (i)  enacting  a  legal  and  regulatory \nframework,  (ii) establishing a supervisory  authority, and (iii) initiating licensing and supervision \nof RFIs. Supervision and regulation functions will be strengthened under subprogram II. \n \n \n \n48. \nIrrespective  of  the  type  of  institution,  the  need  for  capacity  building  for  the  financial \nsector to enhance the sustainable outreach of RF services is pervasive. An autonomous training \ninstitution on comprehensive banking and finance subjects will be established, incorporating the \nexisting  training  facility  of  ADBL,  with  NRB,  ADBL,  and  other  financial  institutions  as \nshareholders.46  The  training  establishment  will  address  capacity  building  needs  of  formal  and \nsemiformal  RFIs. In addition, the training establishment will help rural communities  to improve \nfinancial literacy and access RF services. Subprogram I will field consultant experts for the initial \n2  years  to  help  make  the  training  institute  operational.  Subprogram  II  will  enhance  its  training \ndelivery.  \n \n\nSector Capacity Building  \n\nd. \n\n \n\n \n\ne. \n\nProduct and Process Innovations  \n\n \n49. \nThe  RF  sector  in  Nepal  is  concentrated  on  a  single  product,  i.e.,  credit.  With  limited \naccess to diversified financial products, the rural poor have scarce opportunities to save, invest, \nand mitigate risks. Reducing the vulnerability of rural households, as well as the risk perception \nof  the  RFIs,  is  important  to  induce  economic  activities  in  the  context  of  post-conflict \nrehabilitation.  A  pilot  crop  insurance  scheme  for  up  to  four  districts  will  be  initiated  with  the \nassistance of international and national consultants. In addition, capacity development support \nwill be provided to important RFIs to help them develop, market, and implement diversified RF \nproducts, \nincluding  savings,  micro-insurance,  and  remittance  services.  Outputs  under \nsubprogram  I  will  be  a  review  of  the  results  of  the  pilot,  as  well  as  initiation  of  diversified \nproducts and services by important RFIs.  \n \n\n                                                 \n45  ADB.  2000.

For the first 2 years, support for operational and training expenditures, as well \nas  transferring  management  skills  to  the  local  stakeholders,  will  be  provided.  For  this,  56  person-months  of \nconsultant inputs will be provided (Supplementary Appendix K). \n\n15\n\n \n\n\f16 \n\n \n\n4. \n\nImportant Features  \n\n \n50. \nRFSDCP  focuses  on  post-conflict  rehabilitation  and  poverty  reduction  within  the \nframework  of  financial  sector  reform.  RFSDCP  adopts  a  conflict-sensitive  approach  by \n(i) prioritizing the RF outreach to the lower segment of the RF market in institutional reform and \nrestructuring,  (ii)  emphasizing  links  between  the  institutional  and  financial  services  and \ncommunity-based  groups,  and  (iii)  instituting  good  governance  and  a  code  of  conduct  as  a \nprerequisite in institutional restructuring. \n \n51. \nPrivate  Sector  Participation  in  RFIs.  RFSDCP  includes  a  road  map  for  increasing \nprivate ownership of ADBL.47 A phased increase of the private sector\u2019s stake will be pursued to \nensure efficient resource allocation and good governance.48 The divestment of the Government \nshares  in  ADBL  and  the  IPO  will  be  initiated  to  meet  the  BFIO  requirement  of  30%  public \nshareholding. Privatization options also will be developed as part of the policy conditions under \nsubprogram II. \n \nEmphasizing  RF  Outreach.  As  part  of  ongoing  financial  sector  reforms,  rural  branch \n52. \nnetworks of commercial banks have been rationalized rapidly to streamline operational costs by \neliminating  unviable  branches.  Given  the  scarce  presence  of  RF  in  rural  areas,  conventional \ninstitutional  restructuring  through  rationalization  of  branch  networks  is  not  a  preferred  option \nunder RFSDCP. ADBL will be restructured under the regional business center structure, which \nregionalizes management of rural outlets, while continually expanding outreach to areas without \nsignificant security concerns. \n \nLink With CBOs. With institutional financial services in rural areas severely limited, RF \n53. \nservice delivery through CBOs is the most effective way to reach the lowest segment of the RF \nmarket.  By  supporting  SFDB,  RFSDCP  will  facilitate  an  effective  link  between  the  formal  RFI \nand small farmer cooperatives. The SFDB restructuring plan for SFDB will reflect the close links \nwith GTZ\u2019s ongoing Rural Finance in Nepal Project, which supports developing the capacity of \nsmall farmer cooperatives to deliver effective microfinance services.  \n \n54. \nGood Governance and Code of Conduct. Cognizant that good governance is crucial \nto  achieving  the  sector  reform  and  institutional  restructuring  objectives,  RFSDCP  places  good \ngovernance and adherence to the code of conduct at the center of the ADBL restructuring. To \nassess  the  existing  governance  issues,  as  well  as  the  implementation  capabilities  of  the \nGovernment  and  ADBL,  a  good  governance  and  anticorruption  assessment  was  carried  out \n(Appendix 6 and Supplementary Appendix H). RFSDCP incorporates measures to ensure good \ngovernance, including (i) establishing a governance committee at the ADBL Board of Directors, \n(ii)  strengthening  the  audit  system  through  the  establishment  of  an  audit  committee  of  the \nADBL,  and  (iii)  providing  capacity  development  assistance  for  the  implementation  of  the \ngovernance aspect of the ADBL restructuring. \n\n \n\n                                                 \n47 Stieglitz, Joseph E. 1993. The Role of the State in Financial Market. Washington, DC: World Bank. If the net social \nreturns to efficient financial operations are greater than the returns perceived by private capital, a public sector role \ncan  be  rationalized  on  grounds  of  market  failure  due  to  the  information  and  enforcement  problems,  and  high \ntransaction costs, in rural areas. However, rationalization for inefficiency or imprudent practices, which essentially \nrepresent policy and institutional failures, is not found.  \n\n48 Robinson, M. 1994. Financial Intermediation at the Local Level from Indonesia. Part II; A Theoretical Perspective. \nCambridge, M.A.: Harvard Institute of Development Studies, Harvard University. The large private sector banks got \ninterested and are now operating in rural areas only after the public sector banks proved that RF operations can be \nprofitable. BRI successfully undertook a large initial pubic offering in 2005. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f5. \n\nFinancing Plan  \n\n \n55. \nAs  proposed,  ADB  will  provide  a  loan  of  $56  million  from  its  ADF  resources  for \nsubprogram  I  of  RFSDCP,  with  a  term  of  24  years,  including  a  grace  period  of  8  years.  The \nloans will have an annual interest rate of 1.0% during the grace period and 1.5% thereafter, as \nwell as other terms and conditions set forth in the Loan Agreement.  \n \n56. \nThe ADB fund is to support the institutional reforms and restructuring of ADBL to meet \nthe  required  adjustment  costs.  The  estimated  adjustment  cost  of  $145  million  for  ADBL \nrestructuring  includes  (i)  conversion  of  the  Government\u2019s  loan  to  ADBL  ($65  million)  into  non-\nvoting  preference  shares  of  ADBL,  (ii)  performance-linked  equity  in  the  form  of  non-voting \npreference  shares  from  the  Government  to  ADBL  ($65  million),  and  (iii)  reducing  staff  size  of \nADBL  through  a  voluntary  retirement  scheme  ($15  million).  The  Government  will  use  the \nproceeds  of  the  policy  loan  to  recapitalize  ADBL  through  cash  subscription  of  additional \npreference  shares,  which  will  be  divided  into  redeemable  and  irredeemable  shares.  The \nGovernment has converted its loan of $65 million to ADBL into non-voting preference shares of \nADBL.  By  specifying  the  entire  counterpart  fund  in  cash  to  ADBL  as  preferential  shares,  the \nfinancing  modality  of  RFSDCP  provides  the  Government  with  no  flexibility  in  the  use  of  the \nprogram loan funds, and enables a precise flow of funds that can be monitored. \n \n\n6. \n\nImplementation Arrangements  \n\n \n\na. \n\nProgram Management \n\n \n \n \nThe  MOF,  the  Executing  Agency,  will  establish  a  program  management  unit  (PMU), \n57. \nheaded  by  a  program  director  with  the  rank  of  joint  secretary,  to  coordinate,  monitor,  and \nsupervise  program  implementation.  The  program  director  will  be  assisted  by  a  full-time  staff \nrecruited  with  the  project  grant  support  (para.  75),  and  with  qualifications  and  experience \nsatisfactory to ADB.  \n \n58. \nNRB,  ADBL,  and  SFDB  will  be  the  implementing  agencies.  NRB  will  handle  sector \ncapacity  building,  supportive  legal  and  regulatory  framework,  and  product  and  process \ninnovation. ADBL and SFDB will be responsible for institutional reform and restructuring of their \nrespective  organizations.  NRB,  ADBL,  and  SFDB  will  set  up  program  implementation  units \n(PIU). To facilitate the implementation of policy reforms under its responsibilities, each PIU shall \nhave  a  PIU  director  supported  by  one  specialist  staff  member,  with  qualifications  and \nexperience  acceptable  to  ADB.  PIUs  will  (i)  ensure  smooth  implementation  of  the  Project,  (ii) \nproduce  and  submit  progress  reports  on  time,  and  (iii)  liaise  with  the  PMU  for  the \nimplementation of the Project. The PIU director will report to the program director. \n \n59.  MOF  will  set  up  a  program  steering  committee  (PSC),  chaired  by  the  MOF  secretary, \nwith membership comprising the general manager of ADBL; general manger of SFDB; program \ndirector;  senior  representatives  of  National  Planning  Commission,  Ministry  of  Agriculture  and \nCooperatives,  and  Ministry  of  Land  Reform  and  Management;  and  deputy  governor  of  NRB. \nThe  PSC  will  (i)  provide  policy  and  technical  guidance  to  the  PMU  and  PIUs,  (ii) review  the \nprogress  of  program  implementation,  (iii)  monitor  the  performance  of  the  PMU  and  PIUs,  and \n(iv)  ensure  program  coordination.  The  PSC  will  meet  at  least  quarterly.  The  program \norganization chart is in Supplementary Appendix I. \n \n \n\n17\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f18 \n\n \n\nb. \n\nImplementation Period \n\n \n60. \nThe two cluster subprograms of RFSDCP will be implemented over 5 years, from 2007 to \n2011. The implementation period of subprogram I is 2 years, from January 2007 to December \n2008. Based on the implementation progress under subprogram I and the SPR, the proposal for \nfunding  subprogram  II  is  expected  to  be  submitted  for  ADB  Board  consideration  in  2009.  The \nprogram implementation schedule is in Appendix 7. \n \n\n \n\nc. \n\nProcurement and Disbursement \n\n \n\n \n\nd. \n\nCounterpart Funds  \n\n61. \nIn accordance with provisions of ADB\u2019s Simplification of Disbursement Procedures and \nRelated Requirements for Program Loans, the proceeds of the program loan will be disbursed \nto the Government as the Borrower. The proceeds of the program loan will be utilized to finance \nthe  full  foreign  exchange  costs  (excluding  local  duties  and  taxes)  of  imports  produced  in,  and \nprocured from, ADB\u2019s member countries, other than those specified in the list of ineligible items \n(Appendix 8) and imports financed by other bilateral and multilateral sources. The Government \nwill certify that (i) the value of the country\u2019s eligible imports is equal to, or exceeds, the amounts \nof ADB\u2019s projected disbursements under the policy loan in a given period; and (ii) the policy loan \nproceeds  will  be  utilized  in  a  manner  satisfactory  to  ADB.  The  policy  loan  proceeds  will  be \ndisbursed  based  on  the  certification  provided  by  the  Government,  which  confirms  that  the \nrequirements for the policy loan have been met. ADB will have the right to audit the use of the \nloan proceeds, and to verify the accuracy of the Government\u2019s certification. \n \n \n \n62. \nThe  Government  will  transfer  the  counterpart  funds  in  cash  to  ADBL  for  the \nrecapitalization  by  subscribing  to  the  non-voting  preference  shares,  equally  divided  into \nredeemable  and  irredeemable  shares.  The  precise  definition  of  counterpart  funds,  with  an \nexplicit  expenditure  commitment,  will  ensure  that  the  ADB  loan  proceeds  will  be  utilized  for \nintended purposes. The Government and ADB will monitor the use of counterpart funds linked \nto the progress of ADBL restructuring and attainment of performance benchmarks (Appendix 2, \nTable A2.4; Appendix 4). \n \n \n \n63. \nThe program loan of subprogram I will be released in two tranches. More resources will \nbe  allocated  in  the  first  tranche  to  meet  the  immediate  resource  requirements  of  the \nGovernment  for  rural  investments,  as  emphasized  in  the  FY2007  budget.  In  addition,  the \nGovernment has converted $65 million in debt to ADBL into equity of ADBL for the restructuring \n(para.  56).  The  first  tranche  for  the  equivalent  of  $40  million  will  be  released  upon  loan \neffectiveness.  The  second  tranche  of  $16  million  will  be  released  12  months  after  the  first \ntranche, subject to compliance with the conditions for their release. \n\nTranche Release and Monitoring \n\ne. \n\n \n\nf. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting for the Program Loan \n\n64. \nAt ADB\u2019s request, the use of the loan proceeds will be audited. ADB will retain the right \nto audit any account relating to subprogram I, and to verify the validity of the certification issued \nby  the  Government  for  each  withdrawal  application.  Before  withdrawal,  the  Government  will \nopen  a  deposit  account  at  NRB  to  receive  the  loan  proceeds.  The  Government  will  establish, \nmanage, operate, and liquidate the account in accordance with terms satisfactory to ADB.  \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fThe  PIUs  will  submit  quarterly  progress  reports  to  the  PMU,  as  well  as  additional \n65. \ninformation and analysis to the PMU as appropriate or required. The PMU, in turn, will submit to \nADB  reports  on  policy  and  institutional  reform  implementation.  The  reports  will  include  a \nquarterly report, annual report, and midterm review report. The reports will be submitted in such \nform  and  in  such  detail  as  ADB  may  request,  and  should  include  (i)  progress  made  and \nproblems encountered during the period under review; (ii) steps taken, or proposed to be taken, \nto  remedy  problems  encountered;  (iii)  proposed  detailed  activity  for  RFSDCP  implementation; \nand  (iv)  expected  progress  during  the  next  review  period.  MOF  will  submit  a  program \ncompletion report within 3 months of subprogram I completion. \n \n66. \nThe Government also will ensure that, within 18 months of the loan effectiveness date, \nADBL will undertake a performance audit. An independent and external auditor will conduct the \naudit, which shall focus on operational and financial activities, and will recommend time-bound \nmeasures \nthe \nits  accountability  and \nrecommendations of the performance audit, the Government will ensure that, within 6 months of \nthe  submission  of  the  audit  report,  ADBL  will  implement  these  recommendations  to  the \nsatisfaction of ADB. \n\ntransparency.  Based  on \n\nimprove \n\nfurther \n\nto \n\ng. \n\nProgram Performance Management System \n\nThe PMU will establish and maintain a program performance management system that \n67. \nwill include a database on the status of policy measures and program indicators based on the \npolicy matrix. This will be linked with the project performance management system (para. 86). \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\nh. \n\nProgram Review \n\nreviews \n\nADB  and \n\nthe  Government  will  conduct  semiannual \n\n68. \nthe \nimplementation  of  subprogram  I  to  identify  further  actions  required  for  the  continued \ndevelopment  of  the  RF  sector.  PSC  will  undertake  an  SPR  for  the  Program  (as  the  first \nsubprogram  cluster),  based  on  the  implementation  of  the  studies  undertaken,  as  well  as  the \nexperience  gained  under  subprogram  I  and  the  Project.  This  will  reflect  the  changes  that  might \noccur  in  the  external  policy  environment  during  the  program  period.  The  first  SPR  will  be \nundertaken  before  the  release  of  the  second  tranche  under  subprogram  I  to  (i)  review \ncompliance  with  the  second  tranche  conditions,  (ii)  identify  initial  lesson  learned,  and  (iii) \nformulate the initial outline for the subsequent subprogram under RFSDCP. The final SPR will \nbe undertaken before subprogram II starts to examine and finalize the design of subprogram II. \n\nthroughout \n\nB. \n \n\nThe Project Grant  \n\nObjective \n\n1. \n \n69. \nThe  objective  of  the  project  grant  is  to  support  the  Government\u2019s  RF  sector  reform  and \nrestructuring  efforts  by  facilitating  institutional  reform  and  restructuring  of  essential  RFIs,  and \nimproving  sector  capacity  and  governance.  The  Project  will  be  implemented  over  2  years,  from \nJanuary 2007 to December 2008. \n \n\n2. \n\nComponents and Outputs \n\na. \n\nRFI Restructuring \n\n70. \nRFI  Restructuring:  ADBL.  The  grant  will  support  the  implementation  of  ADBL \nrestructuring processes identified in the ARP with domestic and international consultant experts. \n\n19\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f20 \n\n \n\nThese processes cover (i) governance, (ii) systems, (iii) business processes, (iv) products and \nservices, (v) human resource development, and (vi) information technology. \n  \n71. \nRFI  Restructuring:  SFDB.  The  grant  will  finance  capacity  development  support  for \nSFDB  to  (i)  develop  and  finalize  the  SFDB  restructuring  plan;  and  (ii)  implement  the  priority \nrestructuring  areas  of  microfinance  and  banking  operations,  staff  capacity  building,  and \naccounting and auditing. \n \n\nb. \n\nSupportive Legal and Regulatory Framework \n\n \n72. \nNRB  will  be  assisted  in  (i)  reviewing  the  legal  and  regulatory  arrangements  for \nsupervision  and  regulation  of  RFIs,  (ii)  developing  an  appropriate  legal  framework  for  RFI \nsupervision and regulation, and (iii) implementing licensing and supervision of MFIs. \n \n\nc. \n\nSector Capacity Building \n\n \nThe Project will support the establishment of a training institute in banking and finance, \n73. \nwhich  will  incorporate  the  existing  training  unit.  ADBL,  NRB,  and  other  private  financial \ninstitutions will be shareholders of the new center (para. 48 and footnote 46). The support will \nbe  used  to  (i)  develop  training  curricula,  (ii)  assess  training  needs  for  banks  and  nonbank \nfinancial institutions, (iii) conduct in-class and off-site training for RF operations, (iv) design in-\nhouse  training  programs  for  RFIs,  and  (v)  arrange  training  programs  for  financial  literacy \nimprovement  of  rural  communities  in  coordination  with  NGOs.  Such  assistance  will  cover \nstaffing, library, equipment, and costs of recurring training.  \n \n\nd. \n\nProduct and Process Innovations \n\n \n74. \nThe grant will cover the development of a pilot crop insurance plan and implementation \nof a pilot crop insurance scheme, which will be implemented in at least four areas. Replication of \nthe plan will be considered under subprogram II, subject to the successful outcome of the pilot. \nThe grant also will provide technical support for product development and marketing for savings, \ninsurance, and remittances to RFIs. Technical support on product development will be arranged \nthrough the training institute. \n\ne. \n\nProject Management Support \n\n \n75. \nthe fielding of an RF specialist and an accounting specialist. \n\nThe Project will support the establishment and operations of the PMU and PIUs through \n\n3. \n\nFinancing Plan  \n\n \nThe project cost is estimated at the equivalent of $11.47 million, as detailed in Table 1. \n76. \nThe  financing  plan  is  in  Table  2.

MOF,  as  the  Executing  Agency,  is  responsible  for  the  implementation  of  the  Project. \nNRB,  ADBL,  and  SFDB  will  be  the  implementing  agencies.  NRB  will  handle  sector  capacity \nbuilding, supportive legal and regulatory framework, and product and process innovation. ADBL \nand  SFDB  will  be  responsible  for  institutional  reform  and  restructuring  of  their  respective \norganizations.  The  PMU  and  PIUs  established  under  subprogram  I  also  will  assume  certain \nroles and responsibilities under the Project. The program organization chart is in Supplementary \nAppendix I. The roles and responsibilities of the PMUs are to (i) supervise and advise PIUs on \nproject  implementation,  (ii)  recruit  consultants  and  award  procurement  contracts,  and  (iii) \narrange  PSC  meetings.  The  roles  and  responsibilities  of  the  PIUs  are  to  (i)  ensure  smooth \nimplementation of the Project, (ii) produce and submit progress reports on time, and (iii) liaise \nwith the PMU on project implementation. The PSC established under the Program will have the \nsame functions for the Project.  \n \n\nb. \n \n\nProcurement \n\n78. \nThe procurement of goods, related services, and works financed by the grant will follow \nprocedures outlined in the ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2006). Goods and equipment for an \nMIS  package  for  ADBL,  estimated  to  cost  $1  million  equivalent  or  more  per  contract,  will  be \nprocured using international competitive bidding. Goods and equipment contracts estimated to \ncost  between  $100,000  and  $1  million  will  be  procured  through  national  competitive  bidding. \nGoods and equipment to be procured through national competitive bidding include all types of \n\n21\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f22 \n\n \n\noffice furniture, computer (stand-alone), computer peripherals, and office equipment. Contracts \nthat  cost  $100,000  or  less  may  be  procured  through  shopping.  Before  commencement  of \nnational  competitive  bidding,  ADB  and  the  Government  will  review  the  Government\u2019s \nprocurement  procedures  to  ensure  consistency  with  ADB  requirements.  Any  necessary \nmodifications  or  clarifications  to  the  Government\u2019s  procedures  will  be  documented  in  the \nprocurement plan. The procurement plan is in Appendix 10. \n\n \nc. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n \nConsulting services will be procured in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \n79. \nConsultants  (2006).  The  Project  will  finance  approximately  26  person-months  of  international \nconsulting services and 318 person-months of national consulting services. Where firms are to \nbe engaged, the quality- and cost-based selection method will be used for selecting consultants. \nThe terms of reference for consulting services are in Supplementary Appendix K. \n \n\nd. \n\nAnticorruption Policy \n\n \nADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  was  explained  to,  and  discussed  with,  the  Government, \n80. \nNRB,  ADBL,  and  SFDB.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance,  accountability, \nand  transparency,  ADB  reserves  the  right  to  investigate,  directly  or  through  its  agents,  any \nalleged  corrupt,  fraudulent,  collusive,  or  coercive  practices  relating  to  RFSDCP.  To  support \nthese  efforts,  relevant  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  are  included  in  the  grant \nregulations  and  the  bidding  documents  for  the  Project.  In  particular,  all  contracts  financed  by \nADB  in  connection  with  RFSDCP  shall  include  provisions  specifying  the  right  of  ADB  to  audit \nand  examine  the  records  and  accounts  of  NRB,  ADBL,  and  SFDB,  as  well  as  all  contractors, \nsuppliers, consultants, and other service providers as they relate to RFSDCP. \n \n81. \nseeking to ensure that \n \n\nSpecifically,  RFSDCP  has  been  designed  to  reduce  vulnerability  to  corruption  by \n\nthe  board  of  financial  institutions  are  aware  of  the  possibility  of  corruption  and \nmismanagement  in  their  own  institutions,  and  can  demonstrate  how  they  are \ndealing with these problems; \n\nadequate  steps  to  enhance  corporate  governance  are  taken  in  all  relevant \ninstitutions; \n\nall relevant institutions and the Government give assurances that they will abide \nby transparency and disclosure stipulations, as specified by NRB; and \n\nrigorous  monitoring  mechanisms  are  put  in  place  to  ensure  that  proper \naccounting is made continually of, among others, mandated actions and full fund \nflow management. \n\n \n82. \nFurther,  during  program  implementation,  ADB  will  review  regularly  the  reports  of  audit \nauthorities  to  assess  (i)  the  nature  of  financial  and  administrative  irregularities,  (ii)  pilferage  of \nfunds,  and  (iii)  how  the  financial  institutions  have  responded  to  the  findings.  During  regular \nreview  missions,  governance  and  anticorruption  risks  assessments  will  be  updated  as \nnecessary. Details of anticorruption measures are in Supplementary Appendix H. \n \n\ne. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements  \n\n \n83. \nImmediately after the effectiveness date of the grant, an imprest account denominated in \nUS dollars will be established at NRB. The imprest account will be operated and maintained in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Handbook  on  Loan  Disbursements  (January  2001).  ADB  will  advance \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n \n\n \n\n\finto  the  imprest  account  6  months  of  estimated  expenditures,  or  10%  of  the  grant  amount, \nwhichever  is  lower.  The  Government  uses  the  imprest  account  to  pay  contractors,  suppliers, \nand  others  for  ADB\u2019s  share  of  eligible  project  expenditures  incurred  in  local  and  foreign \ncurrency.  ADB\u2019s  statement  of  expenditure  procedure  will  be  used  to  reimburse  eligible \nexpenditures,  and  to  liquidate  and  replenish  the  imprest  account  for  individual  payments  not \nexceeding $50,000. \n \n \n\nf. \n\nAccounts, Auditing, and Reporting  \n\n \n84. \nThe  PMU  will  maintain  separate  records  and  accounts  for  the  imprest  fund  and  project \nexpenditure  in  accordance  with  sound  accounting  principles,  and  will  have  such  accounts  and \nrecords audited annually by auditors acceptable to ADB. Auditors satisfactory to ADB will audit \nthe use of the imprest account and statement of expenditures procedures. The Government is \nrequested to submit the audited financial statements for project accounts and imprest funds to \nADB  not  more  than  6  months  following  the  end  of  the  fiscal  year.  Independent  auditors \nacceptable to ADB will audit ADBL and SFDB accounts annually. The Government will ensure \nthat audited accounts of ADBL and SFDB will be submitted to ADB within 6 months of the end \nof  financial  year.  Audited  financial  and  operational  information  will  be  made  available  on  the \nADBL  and  SFDB  Websites.  MOF  will  submit  a  program  completion  report  within  3  months  of \nRFSDCP completion.  \n \n85. \nThe  PMU  will  submit  reports  to  ADB  on  the  use  of  the  loan  proceeds,  project \nadministration, and financial management. The reports will be submitted quarterly and annually. \nThe  reports  will  cover  (i)  information  on  project  expenditures;  (ii)  highlights  of  audit  reports  of \nADBL;  other  RFIs;  and  RF  operations  of  commercial  banks;  (iii)  training  activities  under  the \nProject; and their impact; and (iv) performance of the pilot crop insurance scheme. The project \ncompletion report will be submitted to ADB within 3 months of project completion. \n  \n\ng. \n\nProject Performance Management System \n\n \n86. \nADBL  and  SFDB  each  will  establish  and  maintain  a  project  performance  management \nsystem  that  will  generate  semiannual  reports.  The  performance  management  reports  will \ncomprise (i) financial reports covering loan portfolio growth and performance; liability growth and \nmanagement,  especially  of  savings  deposits;  and  financial  performance  indicators,  including \ncapital  adequacy  ratio,  collection  rate,  operating  profit  ratio,  and  nonperforming  loan  ratio;  (ii) \ndetails of the number of borrowers by gender, poverty classification, type of services, and size \nof  transactions;  (iii)  information  on  the  performance  of  staff,  measured  by  financial  volume, \nnumber  of  customers,  and  earnings  ratios;  (iv)  information  on  planned  and  actual  levels  of \nactivities,  as  specified  in  the  design  and  monitoring  framework  (Appendix  5);  and  (v)  annual \nfinancial  statements.  A  format  for  assessing  the  impact  of  the  services  rendered  under  the \nProject on poverty reduction also will be developed.  \n \n \n \n87. \nADB and the Government will undertake semiannual reviews of project implementation. \nThe  reviews  will  evaluate  the  (i)  project  scope,  (ii)  implementation  arrangements,  (iii) \nimplementation of ADBL\u2019s restructuring plan, (iv) progress on the policy reform agenda, and (v) \ncapacity building measures. ADB and the Government also will undertake the midterm review to \nevaluate  physical  and  financial  progress,  implementation  procedures,  procurement,  and \nperformance of consultants, including that of the attached TA.  \n \n\nProject Reviews  \n\nh. \n\n \n\n23\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f24 \n\n \n\nIV. \n\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n\n \n88. \nA  TA  grant  of  $500,000  from  the  Japan  Special  Fund  resources  is  attached  to \nsubprogram  I  of  RFSDCP  to  assist  with  the  implementation  of  ADBL\u2019s  restructuring  plan.  The \nTA will recruit an international chief technical advisor and a domestic internal audit specialist for \n12  months  each,  and  an  international  MIS  specialist  for  6  months  to  advise  ADBL\u2019s  Board  of \nDirectors  and  management  on  all  facets  of  the  restructuring.  The  consultants  will  be  recruited \nthrough  a  firm  using  the  quality-  and  cost-based  selection  method  with  biodata  technical \nproposal. The TA cost is estimated at $600,000. MOF is the Executing Agency. ADBL, as the \nImplementing  Agency,  will  finance  the  equivalent  of  $100,000  to  cover  office  accommodation, \ntransport,  and  administrative  expenses.  The  cost  estimates  and  terms  of  reference  of  the  TA \nconsultants are in Supplementary Appendix L. \n \n\nV. \n\nPROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n\n \nA. \n \n\nBenefits and Impacts  \n\n1. \n\nPolicy \n\n \n89. \nBy addressing the systemic policy issues of the RF sector, the Program will improve the \nRF  market  environment  and  reduce  the  Government\u2019s  direct  involvement  in  RF.  The  right \nmarket conditions will induce healthy competition among formal and semiformal RFIs, as well as \nfacilitate  cost-efficient  and  client-centered  RF  services.  ADBL  restructuring  will  provide \nincentives for RFIs\u2019 self-resource mobilization through savings and demand-led rural lending. \n \n\nInstitutional  \n\n2.  \n \n90. \nAs the largest RFI in the country, ADBL will establish the benchmark for RF operations. \nDivestment  of  the  Government  shares  in  ADBL,  and  movement  towards  its  privatization,  will \nencourage commercial banks to enter the RF market. Privatization of SFDB also will be pursued \nthrough  the  divestment  of  ADBL  shares  in  SFDB,  and  by  increasing  the  shareholder \nparticipation  of  small  farmer  cooperatives.  The  privatization  of  GBBs  will  continue  to  be \nsupported.  \n\nEconomic and Financial  \n\n \nRFSDCP  will  generate  a  significant  number  of  jobs  and  enhance  incomes.  Direct \n91. \nemployment  will  be  generated  by  developing  small  and  microenterprises.  Enhanced  financial \nand institutional sustainability of RFIs will enable them to mobilize deposits safely, and deploy \nthem more efficiently in credit, facilitating the flow of resources to rural areas. Improved financial \nviability of RFIs will reduce significantly the Government\u2019s budgetary burden.  \n\nEnvironmental  \n\n \n92. \nEnvironmental  implications  of  farm  and  non-farm  activities  have  been  assessed.  As \nclients  engage  mainly  in  subsistence  farming  on  a  limited  scale,  no  negative  environmental \nis  category  C.49  The \nimpacts  are  expected.  Environmental  classification  of  RFSDCP \nenvironmental assessment is in Supplementary Appendix M. \n \n\n \n3.  \n\n \n4. \n\n \n\n                                                 \n49  A  project  is  classified  as  one  of  the  environmental  categories  (A,  B,  C,  or  FI).  If  a  project  is  categorized  C,  it  \n\nunlikely has adverse environmental impacts. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f5. \n\nSocial and Poverty  \n\nRisks \n\n \n93. \nRFSDCP is expected to reduce poverty, contributing to stability and the peace process \nin rural areas. Increased financial intermediation will help farmers to increase their productivity \nand support private farm and non-farm enterprises, which will generate jobs for the rural poor. \nRFSDCP  will  not  have  any  adverse  impact  on  indigenous  peoples.  The  summary  poverty \nreduction  and  social  strategy  is  in  Appendix  11.  The  poverty  impact  assessment  is  in \nSupplementary Appendix N. \n \nB. \n \n94. \nThe success of RFSDCP depends on a number of assumptions that are subject to risks \n(Appendix 6). The main risks would include (i) inadequate staff capacity in RFIs and regulatory \nbodies  to  implement  the  reforms;  (ii)  lack  of  Government  commitment  to  reforms;  (iii)  weak \nboards  in  RFIs,  and  generally  weak  capacity  in  them;  and  (iv)  deterioration  in  the  security \nsituation. To manage these risks and minimize  residual risks, the Project has several ongoing \nand proposed mitigating measures.  \n \n95. \nContinued Commitment for Reform. As the Government is in transition, reform policy \nof  financial  institutions,  especially  on  privatization  and  the  role  of  RFIs,  might  change.  The \nGovernment  has  provided  assurances  regarding  the  implementation  of  the  reforms,  with  strict \nadherence  to  the  law.  The  Government  is  fully  committed  to  the  restructuring  of  ADBL,  as \ndemonstrated by the conversion of the Government debt to equity in ADBL (para. 43). Further, \nthe  Government  recognizes  the  importance  of  strengthening  ADBL  operations  for  effective \nservices and poverty reduction.  \n \n96. \nFiduciary  Management.  The  most  recent  update  of  Nepal\u2019s  Country  Financial \nAccountability  Assessment,  carried  out  in  May  2005  by  World  Bank  and  the  Department  for \nInternational Development,50 concluded that, despite some progress, substantial issues remain \nand Nepal\u2019s fiduciary risk is still considered high. However, by specifying that the program loan \nproceeds  be  used  for  the  recapitalization  of  ADBL,  RFSDCP  provides  a  clear  framework  for \nfiscal control. As a class A institution under BFIO, ADBL is subject to NRB supervision. Further, \nregular  progress  monitoring  of  the  restructuring  process,  and  internal  and  external  audits  of \nADBL, will ensure that the funds are used for the intended purpose. The financial management \nassessment is in Supplementary Appendix O. \n \nLocal Level Security. Though the overall security situation has improved, the situation \n97. \nin  some  parts  remains  tenuous.  As  a  result,  expected  outreach  expansion  and  new  product \nservice  delivery  might  be  delayed  in  those  areas.  While  the  restructuring  of  ADBL  does  not \ninclude area-specific priorities, the regional business center structure allows a regional center to \nmanage and control the outreach expansion and service delivery through local outlets. This will \nenable the regional center to engage in rural outreach  selectively, starting from low-risk areas \nand expanding to other areas as the security situation improves. \n \nImplementation  Capacity  and  Conceptual  Changes.  The  reform  of  RF  policies  and \n98. \nthe restructuring of RFIs require understanding of the new RF sector policies and the skill sets \nto  implement  the  activities.  Government  officials  might  have  difficulty  changing  their  mindsets \nand  formulating  sector  policies  from  private  sector-oriented  perspectives.  At  the  onset  of  the \nProgram, therefore, an intensive initial orientation program will be conducted for them. The new \n\n                                                 \n50 Department  for  International  Development,  World  Bank.  2005.  Nepal\u2019s  Country  Financial  Accountability \n\nAssessment. Kathmandu. \n\n25\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f26 \n\n \n\nbusiness processes of ADBL require different skill sets that long-serving ADBL employees might \nnot  have.  In  2006,  the  first  voluntary  retirement  scheme  released  approximately  350  staff \nmembers whose skills were not in line with the requirements under the new business process. \nADBL  is  planning  a  second  voluntary  retirement  scheme  in  2007,  while  simultaneously \nrecruiting new staff members to better fill the skills gap. \n \n99. \nPrivate  Sector  Perception.  The  private  sector\u2019s  confidence  to  invest  in  RF  in  Nepal \ndepends on whether the Government and RFIs can produce successful outcomes as a result of \nthe reform. Any redirection of the reform policies, or delay in RFI restructuring processes, might \ncause the private sector to lose confidence. The measures under RFSDCP to improve investor \nconfidence  includes  (i)  up-front  recapitalization  of  ADBL  to  meet  the  minimum  capital \nrequirement, (ii) rigorous monitoring of the implementation of the restructuring process to meet \nthe performance benchmark, and (iii) support to NRB for supervision of good governance and \nsustainability of RFIs.  \n \n100.  Notwithstanding  these  risks  (paras.  94\u201399),  program  implementation  is  not  likely  to  be \naffected given the following: \n\nThe  conflict  in  Nepal  has  subsided  almost  completely,  permitting  development \nactivities throughout all rural areas after more than a decade.  \n\nThe  outputs  and  outcomes  of  RFSDCP  will  address  the  root  causes  of  rural \npoverty, helping to mitigate the revival of conflicts. \n\nRFSDCP \nincorporates mitigating measures in the program design and implementation. \n\ntakes  a  conflict-sensitive  approach,  which  assesses  risks  and \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \n\nVI. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n \n101. \nassurances, which have been incorporated in the legal documents: \n \nA. \n \n\nThe Program Loan \n\nThe  Government  will (a) maintain  the policies adopted and  actions taken prior to \nthe  date  of  the  Loan  Agreement  for  the  program  loan,  as  described  in  the \ndevelopment  policy  letter  and  the  policy  matrix,  for  the  duration  of  RFSDCP  and \nsubsequently; (b) promptly adopt the other policies and the other actions included \nin RFSDCP as specified in the development policy letter and the policy matrix; and \n(c)  ensure  that  such  policies  and  actions  continue  in  effect  for  the  duration  of \nRFSDCP and subsequently. \n\nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  the  pilot  crop  insurance  scheme  will  be \nimplemented to the satisfaction of ADB. \n\nThe Government will ensure that any actions taken by the Government in respect \nof  the  operations  of  ADBL  will  be  done  in  accordance  with  the  prevailing  laws \nand  regulations  and  promote  financial  soundness  and  operational  viability  of \nADBL. \n\n(iv) \n\nThe Government will ensure that ADBL will promptly inform ADB of any change \nin its board of directors or its General Manager, and ensure that any such change \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n \n\n \n\n\f(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\nwill  be  made  in  accordance  with  the  prevailing  laws  and  regulations  and  its \nMemorandum and Articles of Associations. \n\nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  ADBL  will  carry  out  its  banking  operations  in \naccordance with the provisions under BFIO and prudential norms prescribed by \nNRB  under  its  directives  throughout  the  implementation  of  the  Program  and \nsubsequently thereafter. \n\nThe Government will ensure that ADBL will adopt and implement good corporate \nthe  relevant  regulatory \ngovernance  norms  and  practices  prescribed  by \ninstitutions  throughout  the  implementation  of  the  Program  and  subsequently \nthereafter. \n\nIf requested by ADB, the Government will undertake an audit of the use of loan \nproceeds. Further, ADB retains the right to (a) audit any account relating to the \nProgram, and (b) verify the validity of the certification issued by the Government \nfor each withdrawal application.  \n\n(viii)  Within  12  months  from  the  loan  effectiveness,  the  Government  will  ensure  that \nADBL  will  have  acquired  and  installed  forensic accounting ability  to  support  the \nAudit Committee to track and minimize corruption cases. \n\n(ix)  Within 6 months of the loan effectiveness, the Government will ensure that ADBL \nfull \n\nthe  necessary  mechanisms  required \n\nwill  have  established \nimplementation of its Code of Conduct to the satisfaction of ADB. \n\nthe \n\nfor \n\n(x)  Within  18  months  of  the  loan  effectiveness,  the  Government  will  ensure  that \nADBL  undertakes  a  performance  audit  to  be  conducted  by  an  independent  and \nexternal  auditor,  which  will  focus  on  its  operational  and  financial  activities,  and \nwill  recommend  time-bound  measures  to  further  improve  its  accountability  and \ntransparency.

Although financial institutions have proliferated, financial \nservice outreach remains shallow, reaching only 28% of the total population. Nepal\u2019s rural poor \nhave not reaped the potential gains of the Government\u2019s efforts to liberalize the financial sector. \nThe weak performance of the rural finance (RF)1 sector and limited outreach are mainly due to \n(i) excessive public involvement in the sector, (ii) a weak regulation and supervision system, and \n(iii)  inadequate  institutional  capacity.  Fundamental  sector  reforms  are  required  to  address  the \npolicy and institutional bottlenecks for the development of the RF sector through (i) institutional \nreform  and  restructuring,  (ii)  development  of  a  supportive  regulatory  framework,  (iii)  sector \ncapacity building, and (iv) widening of products and services.  \n \n2. \nRural Finance Market Structure. The demand profile stratifies the RF sector into three \nbroad  segments\u2014upper,  middle,  and  lower\u2014that  reflect  the  landholding  pattern,  nature  of \nthe  rural  society.  These  segments  are \nemployment,  and  socioeconomic  structure  of \ninterdependent  and  inherently  overlap.  The  upper  segment  includes  agriculture  commodity \nprocessors, wholesalers, and farmers with large holdings. The middle segment comprises petty \ntraders, and small and tenanted farmers. The lower segment includes landless poor, as well as \nsmall,  marginal,  tenanted,  and  subsistence  farmers.  The  middle  and  upper  segments  demand \ncredit products, including (i) working capital; (ii) cash credit; (iii) loans against pledge of produce; \n(iv) and medium- to long-term loans for crop cultivation, rural transport, and land development. \nThe lower segment primarily requires small and short- to medium-term loans for consumption, \nmicroenterprises, and crop cultivation. \n \n3. \nRural  Finance  Supply  Side.  Nepal\u2019s  RF  market  comprises  a  range  of  heterogeneous \ninstitutions  (Table  A1.1).  The  formal  RF  sector  that  is  supervised  or  registered  with  Nepal \nRastra  Bank  (NRB)\u2014the  central  bank\u2014comprises  (i)  the  Agricultural  Development  Bank \nLimited (ADBL); (ii) Small Farmers Development Bank (SFDB); (iii) five Grameen Bikash Banks \n(GBB),  i.e.,  rural  development  banks;  (iv)  17  commercial  banks;  (v)  11  private  sector \nmicrofinance  development  banks;  (vi)  19  savings  and  credit  cooperative  societies;  (vii)  47 \nmicrofinance  nongovernment  organizations  (NGO);  and  (viii)  63  finance  companies.  The \nsemiformal  sector,  which  is  not  supervised  by  NRB,  comprises  Government-sponsored  rural \ncredit  programs,  about  2,300  savings  and  credit  cooperative  societies  registered  under  the \nCooperative Act, and nearly 60 multisector NGOs. The Rural Microfinance Development Centre, \nan apex body, provides refinance and capacity building support to RF institutions (RFI) and their \nclients.  The  informal  sector  comprises  money  lenders,  traders,  friends,  relatives,  and  about \n12,000 community organizations.  \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n                                                 \n1   RF  can  be  classified  as  financial  services  provided  to  rural  farm  and  non-farm  households,  a  large  proportion  of \nwhich are poor and low-income households. Microfinance, as an RF subset, targets the poor. While RF institutions \nalso service the poor, low-income households, and the non-poor, microfinance institutions (MFI) focus exclusively \non the poor. Considering the demographics of Nepal, microfinance is primarily rural, though some MFIs also target \nthe urban poor. In this article, the terms \u201cRF\u201d and \u201cRFIs\u201d include \u201cmicrofinance\u201d and \u201cMFIs\u201d, respectively. The terms \nmicrofinance and MFIs are used only for specific microfinance-related references. \n\n\f30 \n\n \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n \nTable A1.1: Formal Financial Intermediaries\u2019 Share of Total Assets  \n\nInstitutions \n\nNumber of \nInstitutions \n\nCommercial Banks \nFinance Companies \nDevelopment Banksa \nMicrofinance Development Banks \nSavings and Credit Cooperatives \nNon Government Organizationsb \nNote.

Rural or \nurban populations at lower segments of income distribution have had difficulty accessing banks \nand  other  formal  financial  institutions.  The  majority  of  rural  households,  especially  in  the  hill \nareas,  have  no  access  to  institutional  financial  services.  In  most  of  the  rural  areas,  ADBL, \nSFDB, and cooperatives provide RF services.  \n \n5. \nDemand  and  Supply  Gap.  The  total  rural  credit  requirement  is  estimated  at  NRs24.3 \nbillion,  while  the  total  supply  from  the  formal  and  semiformal  sectors  is  estimated  at  NRs2.6 \nbillion\u2014meeting  only  10%  of  the  potential  demand.  The  supply  is  primarily  for  credit  and,  to \nsome  extent,  savings.  On  the  supply  continuum,  the  upper  and  middle  segments  have  more \naccess to formal financial sources, while the lower segment relies mostly on informal sources. \nOf  the  aggregate  supply,  nearly  three  fourths  is  from  informal  sources.  ADBL  and  the  rural \nbranches of commercial banks concentrate primarily on the upper and middle segments of the \nRF sector. GBBs, SFDB, private sector microfinance banks, and NGOs focus on the lower end \nof the RF sector. ADBL accounts for nearly two thirds of rural credit. \n  \n6. \nPublic  Intervention.  In  response  to  rural  poverty  in  a  predominantly  agricultural \neconomy,  the  Government  of  Nepal  (the  Government)  participated  in,  and  controlled  until \nrecently,  RF  on  the  assumption  that  (i)  access  to  cheap  institutional  credit  could  induce \ninvestment;  (ii)  intervention  was  required  to  ensure  a  sufficient  flow  of  rural  credit;  and  (iii) \nbanks, both commercial and specialized, had a social responsibility to serve the rural clientele, \neven  if  it  meant  incurring  losses.  The  Government  pursued  this  approach  through  directed \ncredit, state-owned RFIs, and loans at below-cost interest rates. In this environment, RFIs and \ncommercial  banks  had  little,  if  any,  incentives  to  adopt  sound  practices  and  enhance  portfolio \nquality through strict credit appraisal and delinquency management.  \n \n7. \nInstitutional Inadequacies. Weak management that is not driven by the market, as well \nas  deviation  from  best  practice  standards,  has  affected  the  sustainability  of  RFIs.  RFIs  suffer \nfrom  weak  governance,  high  transaction  costs,  and  high  nonperforming  loans.  Inadequate \nsupervision  has  allowed  these  weaknesses  to  remain  unattended.  Financial  and  institutional \nconstraints  limit  ADBL\u2019s  capacity  to  expand  its  outreach.  The  ongoing  restructuring  of  GBBs2 \nhas shown mixed results, and a turnaround of two of the five GBBs is unlikely. While NGOs are \neffective  in  reaching  the  rural  poor,  only  a  few  large  NGOs  are  moving  towards  self-\n                                                 \n2   The GBB restructuring process, which was initiated by the Government, includes the divestment of NRB\u2019s shares \nin GBBs, and the privatization of solvent GBBs. Of the five GBBs (Eastern, Central, Western, Mid-western, and Far \nwestern), the Eastern and Western ones have already been privatized. \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n 31\n\nsustainability. Only the private sector microfinance banks have an overall positive performance \nrecord, primarily due to better governance. The high-risk perception and politicization of the RF \nsector  has  deterred  commercial  banks  from  expanding  their  RF  portfolios.  As  part  of  the \nongoing restructuring of the two largest commercial banks, their branch networks in rural areas \nare likely to be reduced further. \n \n8. \nLimited Outreach and Range of Services. Despite their extensive network, RFIs have \ninadequate outreach and are concentrated in the flat lands. The outreach in sparsely populated \nmountainous  areas  is  negligible.  The  aggregate  credit  outreach  from  formal  and  semiformal \ninstitutions is estimated at 23% of the rural households. Given the limited access to credit, rural \nhouseholds  have  been  restricted  to  borrowing  levels  that  are  substantially  below  their  needs. \nMany borrowers in the middle and lower segments do not borrow because they are averse to \nrisk,  particularly  when  risk  mitigation  products  and  services  are  not  widely  available. \nQualitatively,  the  supply  side  remains  shallow,  with  a  lack  of  variety,  breadth,  and  range  of \nservices  provided.  The  RF  system  is  not  in  a  position  to  provide  credit  products  tailored  to \npurpose,  crop  insurance,  and  remittance  services  to  the  majority  of  rural  households.  Despite \nsome  credit  expansion,  the  availability  of  medium-  to  long-term  credit  in  rural  areas  has \nremained  limited.  Further,  the  disturbed  security  situation  in  rural  areas  has  accentuated  RF \nsector weaknesses.  \n \nImpact  of  Conflict  on  Rural  Finance.  Despite  the  conflict  during  1996\u20132006,  the \n9. \ndemand  for  RF  services  remained  strong.  The  number  of  borrowing  households  from  all \nsources  grew  during  the  conflict.  Institutional  credit  also  grew,  mainly  because  commercial \nbanks have become more reluctant to lend money in rural areas, while the demand for financial \nservices from farmers and microenterprises has not waned. Some microfinance institutions and \ncooperatives remained stable or expanded during the conflict, while commercial banks became \nmore  focused  on  urban  consumer  lending  and  housing  finance.  Due  to  the  conflict,  weak \ncooperatives  have  been  driven  out  or  weakened  further.  Some  of  them  have  closed,  while \nothers  have  relocated  to  safer  places.  Microfinance  NGOs,  small  farmer  cooperatives  with \nactive members, and capable leaders have not been affected or recovered quickly.  \n \n10. \nStrengthening the Rural Finance Sector. Structural reforms in Nepal have brought a \nvisible  shift  in  financial  sector  policies.  Financial  markets  are  deepening,  with  institutional \nrestructuring,  product  innovation,  and  expansion.  This  has  established  the  foundation  for \nfundamental  RF  reforms.  The  Government  strategy  for  strengthening  RF  is  broadly  two-\npronged.  The  first  set  of  the  strategy  focuses  on  improving  the  (i)  policy  environment, \n(ii) financial governance, and (iii) supervisory and regulatory mechanisms. The second relates to \n(i) \nthe  demand  side,  and \n(iii) enhancing sustainable outreach. \n \nThe  most  critical  element  in  RF  reforms  is  a  policy  change  to  shape  the  norms  and \n11. \nincentives in which RFIs operate, and to enable the development of a sustainable RF subsector. \nRepressive  interest  rate  controls  have  been  removed,  and  mandatory  priority  sector  credit \nrequirements  are  being  phased  out.  NRB  is  divesting  ownership  in  GBBs;  wherever  possible, \nGBBs  are  being  privatized,  and  their  executive  directors  are  being  recruited  from  the  market. \nSimultaneously, the Government and NRB have encouraged the establishment of private sector \nmicrofinance banks to enhance institutional diversity. \n \nThe enactment of the Banks and Financial Institutions Ordinance (BFIO) in 2004 created \n12. \na legal framework that allows classes and types of institutions, including RFIs, to be established \nbased on capitalization and scope of functions. In terms of BFIO, all RFIs will be subject to NRB \n\n(ii)  strengthening \n\nimplementing \n\nrestructuring, \n\ninstitutional \n\n\f32 \n\n \n\nAppendix 1 \n\nsupervision and will be required to meet prescribed prudential norms. BFIO requires enhanced \nmeasures for good governance, disclosures, and reporting requirements in financial institutions. \nIn  addition,  the  Financial  Intermediary  Act  1998  provides  a  facilitating  framework  and  a  legal \nstatus  for  NGOs  to  participate  actively  in  RF  service  delivery.  Simultaneously,  the  supervisory \nand  regulatory  functions  for  NRB  are  being  strengthened,  and  the  possibility  of  a  second  tier \nregulatory arrangement for small RFIs is being explored. ADBL, as well as SFDB, can be turned \naround  with \ninstitutional  strengthening  and  capacity  enhancement  support.  Sustained \napplication of international best practices will be required to (i) enhance good governance and \nautonomy;  (ii)  improve  financial,  accounting,  and  management  systems;  and  (iii)  reduce \ntransaction costs. \n \n13. \nGiven the infrastructure and skills deficit context in which most RFIs operate, RF reforms \nmust be accompanied by investments in demand-side development that enable the rural poor, \nfor  instance,  to  utilize  RF  services  effectively  through  better  skills  and  access  to  markets.  To \naddress  core  poverty  issues  in  conflict-affected  areas,  a  flexible  approach  for  reactivating, \nstrengthening, or establishing new institutions is required. Further, innovations in products and \nservices\u2014such  as  for  savings,  remittances,  and  risk  mitigation\u2014must  be  supported.  The \nemphasis  on  poverty  reduction  also  will  require  sustained  and  specific  support  for  RFIs  that \ntarget  the  lowest  segment  of  the  RF  sector,  as  well  as  arrangements  aimed  at  enhancing  the \noutreach  of  RF  in  remote  and  mountainous  areas.  In  this  context,  expanding  the  role  and \ncoverage  of  the  Rural  Microfinance  Development  Centre  will  be  important  (Supplementary \nAppendix E). \n \n14. \nThe  Government  is  pursuing  an  RF  policy  that  places  RF  sector  development  in  the \nbroader perspective of financial sector development. The strategic elements suggest a shift to a \ndemand-driven  approach,  where  sustainable  RFIs  are  expected  to  reach  more  clients  and \ndiversify products, thereby meeting rural people\u2019s diverse needs more effectively. However, for \nthe  ongoing  reforms  to  succeed,  sustained  emphasis  on  good  governance,  transparency,  and \nsystemic  depoliticization  is  imperative.  The  resulting  sustainable  system  will  reduce  fiscal \npressure, enabling increased investment in development.  \n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n        33 \n\nAGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT BANK LIMITED \n\nA. \n\nLegal Framework, Objectives, and Ownership \n\nThe  Agricultural  Development  Bank  Limited  (ADBL)3  was  founded  as  the  Agricultural \n1. \nDevelopment Bank of Nepal (ADBN) under the ADBN Act in 1967. In 1968, ADBL assumed the \nassets and liabilities of the Cooperative Bank to provide credit for agricultural development, and \nabsorbed the Land Reform Savings Corporation in 1973. The purpose of ADBL is to contribute \nto  the  development  of  agriculture  and  improvement  of  living  standards  of  the  rural  population, \nand  to  make  capital  and  loans  available  to  the  agriculture  sector,  according  to  the  ADBN  Act. \nADBL  has  been  the  largest  rural  finance  institution,  supplying  more  than  67%  of  institutional \ncredit  in  the  country.  Under  the  pre-2005  structure,  the  Government  owned  the  majority \n(92.94%)  of  ADBN\u2019s  shares,  followed  by  individuals  (4.87%),  Nepal  Rastra  Bank  (NRB) \n(1.98%), other companies (0.17%), and cooperatives (0.04%). \n \nB. \n\nManagement \n\n2. \nThe  ADBL  Board  comprises  seven  members,  including  the  general  manager  of  ADBL \nand representatives from NRB (the central bank); cooperative institutions; Ministry of Agriculture \nand  Cooperatives;  Ministry  of  Land  Reform  and  Management;  and  Ministry  of  Finance.  The \nADBN  Act  gives  the  board  powers  to  guide  and  control  the  general  administration  of  ADBL. \nHowever,  the  board\u2019s  role  as  the  supreme  decision-making  and  governing  body  of  ADBL  are \nlimited,  because  timely  and  accurate  information  on  ADBL\u2019s  financial  and  operational  position \nusually  is  not  available  due  to  insufficient  management  and  information  system  capacity.  In \naddition, the interests of clients and the Government often do not convergent, and the current \ngovernance structure could force the board to act on behalf of the Government. \n \nC. \n\nOrganization, Staffing, and Personnel Administration \n\n3. \nWith its head office in Kathmandu, ADBL operates 300 units, including one head office, \n11  regional offices,  181  development  banking branches,  45  commercial  banking branches,  57 \nSmall Farmers Development Program (SFDP) offices, and 5 regional training center branches. \nAt  the  head  office,  ADBL  has  four  deputy  general  managers  who  oversee  11  divisions.  The \norganizational  structure  of  ADBL  is  fragmented  and  duplicated  with  specialized  support  units \nwithin various departments across the organization. The roles and mandates of the divisions are \nnot  defined  sufficiently,  resulting  in  multiple  lines  of  reporting  and  chains  of  command.  ADBL \nhas 3,985 staff. ADBL\u2019s ratio of clients per loan officer is high at approximately 450 clients per \nofficer.  Recruitment  of  staff  is  centralized,  career  planning  and  development,  and  an  effective \npromotion  policy  are  lacking.  Due  to  the  inefficient  performance  evaluation  system,  incentives \nand  rewards  do  not  necessarily  stimulate  increased  productivity  or  foster  initiatives.  Staff  also \nhave limited training opportunities, a prerequisite for offering quality services to clients. \n \nD. \n\nOperations \n\nADBL\u2019s  operations  are  broadly  divided \n\ninto  three  areas:  development  finance, \n4. \ncommercial  banking,  and  SFDP.  The  development  finance  operations  provide  loans  for \nagricultural production and related activities, and include short-, medium-, and long-term loans. \n\n                                                 \n3  The  erstwhile  Agricultural  Development  Bank  of  Nepal  (ADBN)  was  incorporated  and  renamed  the  Agricultural \nDevelopment Bank Limited (ADBL) in July 2005. In this appendix, ADBL is used throughout, even when referring to \nthe  pre-incorporated  status.  ADBN  is  used  for  the  Act  (ADBN  Act),  and  to  distinguish  the  status  of  ADBN  from \nADBL, as necessary. \n\n\f34 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nADBL\u2019s development finance loans account for more than 63% of the agriculture credit from the \nbanking system. In addition to providing loans, ADBL also promotes agricultural technology to \nfarmers,  and  operates  the  agricultural  credit  training  institute  and  regional  training  centers  to \ncreate awareness and develop the skills of borrowers. \n \n5. \nCommercial  banking  activities  include  loans,  deposits,  guarantees,  and  money  transfer \nservices. Deposits are available for demand deposits, savings, and term deposits. Commercial \nloans of ADBL are provided for commercial, industry, overdraft, contract, and hire-purchase for \nconstruction, transportation, and services. ADBL has access to a savings and fixed-term deposit \nbase of NRs30 billion, of which savings deposits accounted for more than 50%.  \n \n6. \nIn  addition  to  an  agriculture  development  division  and  a  commercial  banking  division, \nADBL operates a small farmer development division, which manages and controls SFDP. Under \nSFDP,  members  from  households  with  a  per  capita  family  income  equal  to  or  less  than \nNRs2,500 form groups of 5\u201310 members. The groups are eligible to receive services of credit, \nsavings, training, social and community development, and empowerment. ADBL provides loans \nto  the  groups  for  production,  marketing,  and  other  income  and  employment-generating \nactivities.  Savings  facilities  are  provided  as  a  mandatory  activity  to  instill  in  the  members  a \nsavings  habit.  ADBL  also  provides  training  and  skills  development  for  the  members,  including \ngroup management, savings mobilization, and skills for income-generating activities.  \n \nE. \n\nFinancial Performance \n\n7. \nProfitability. ADBL\u2019s income was NRs2.8 billion in FY2005 (Table A2.1). Profit grew by \n1% during fiscal year (FY) 2002, declined by 83% during FY2004, and has been negative since \n2004  due  to  the  provisioning  required  for  writing  off  the  bad  debt.  Stagnated  profitability  and \nsignificant portfolio growth until 2004 resulted in the deterioration of key ratios over the past 3 \nyears  (Table  A2.2).

Domestic sources comprise funds \nfrom  NRB,  commercial  banks,  and  the  Government.  Borrowing  from  commercial  banks \nrepresents  the  requirement  for  12%  of  their  portfolio  in  priority  sector  lending  and  3%  in \ndeprived sector lending. Priority sector lending is expected to be phased out by 2007. Deposits \nand savings were NRs27 billion at the end of FY2005, representing 93% of total liabilities and \ncapital.  The  loan\u2013deposit  ratio  increased  between  FY2004  and  FY2005  from  1.25:1  to  1.17:1 \ndue to the 8.2% growth of the loan portfolio during that period. \n \n11. \nNonperforming  Loans.  Based  on  the  international  practices  of  loan  classification, \n52.6%  of  the  gross  loan  portfolio  of  NRs24.2  billion  was  estimated  as  performing  in  FY2003, \nwhile the remaining 47.4% was classified as nonperforming. In FY2005, 36.5% of the NRs31.3 \nbillion in outstanding loans were nonperforming, according to the NRB classification. The NRB \nclassification  is  less  stringent  than  the  international  practices  and  the  ratio  of  nonperforming \nloans is higher if adjusted to international practices. ADBL portfolio quality has deteriorated due \nto (i) weak loan appraisal, (ii) absence of credit risk management, (iii) inadequate internal audit \ncontrols, and (iv) political interference in loan collections.  \n \nF. \n\nADBL Restructuring Plan \n\nIn  2003,  the  Government  conducted  the  operational  and  financial  review  of  ADBL \n12. \nthrough  technical  assistance4  funded  by  Asian  Development  Bank.  The  review  found  serious \ndeficiencies in ADBL operations in terms of (i) loan appraisal, sanctioning, and disbursements; \n(ii)  loan  classification  and  provisioning;  (iii)  supervision  and  monitoring;  (iv)  management \ninformation  system;  (v)  policies  and  procedures;  (vi)  loan  rescheduling  process;  and  (vii)  staff \nskills  and  orientation.  In  addition,  problems  in  realization  of  securities, natural  calamities,  rural \nsecurity  issues,  deficiencies  in  the  segregation  of  responsibilities  for  loan  approval  and \nmanagement,  and  lack  of  preventive  controls  contributed  to  low  repayments  and  huge \naccumulation of nonperforming loans.  \n \n13. \nThe  operational  and  financial  review  resulted  in  the  ADBL  restructuring  plan  (ARP), \nwhich  is  available  in  Supplementary  Appendix  F.  In  February  2004,  the  Government  adopted \nthe  ARP  as  part  of  its  commitment  under  the  Poverty  Reduction  and  Growth  Facility  of  the \nInternational Monetary Fund.5 ARP aims to bring about (i) fundamental reforms in governance, \nmanagement, and business processes and services; (ii) divestment of the Government shares \nin  ADBL;  and  (iii)  the  eventual  privatization  of  ADBL.  The  Government  has  initiated  reforms \nidentified  in  the  ARP:  (i)  incorporating  the  erstwhile  ADBN  as  ADBL  in  July  2005,  with \nauthorized  capital  of  NRs12  billion;  (ii)  initiating  the  recapitalization  of  ADBL  by  converting  its \nloan  of  NRs4.9  billion  to  ADBL  into  the  preferential  shares  in  ADBL  in  May  2006;  and  (iii) \nplanning  to  inject  additional  capital  by  subscribing  to  more  preference  shares.  In  accordance \nwith  the  enactment  of  the  Banks  and  Financial  Institutions  Ordinance6  in  2004,  the  ADBN  Act \nwas repealed and ADBL was licensed as a category A financial institution. \n \n                                                 \n4   ADB. 2000.

Within  the  context  of  ongoing  financial  sector  reforms,  the  reform  of  ADBL  was \nconsidered  crucial  to  facilitate  fundamental  rural  finance  sector  policy  changes  for  greater \nefficiency  and  outreach  expansion.  Under  the  ARP  framework,  ADBL  will  be  reformed  to \nbecome a viable and reliable rural finance institution with greater relevance to agricultural and \nrural sector development. In connection with the implementation of ARP, the Government has \nagreed  to  the  performance  benchmarks  for  operational  improvement  (Table  A2.4),  as  well  as \nthe implementation of the following reform framework over 3 years:  \n \n\nLegal,  ownership,  and  governance.  The  equity  stake  gradually  will  be \nprivatized as the implementation of ARP progresses. \n\nFinancial  restructuring.  Capitalization  and  adequate  provisioning  for  bad  and \ndoubtful assets will be undertaken based on NRB reforms for commercial banks. \nADBL is expected to attain a net profit of NRs74 million in 2006 and positive net \nworth from 2007 (Supplementary Appendix G). \n\nOrganizational  restructuring.  The  organization  will  be  rationalized  around  a \nprofit-center concept, and staff reduction through a voluntary separation scheme. \n\nInstitutional  strengthening.

Laws  and  regulations  that  were  institutionally \nrather than functionally focused proliferated, creating a fragmented legal environment. In February \n2004, the Government came up with BFIO to serve as a legal basis for the work of, among others, \nRF institutions (RFI) in the country. The ordinance includes provisions concerning (i) establishment \nof banks/financial institutions and their boards, (ii) licensing, (iii) operation of financial transactions, \n(iv)  regulation,  (v)  inspection  and  supervision,  and  (vi)  accounts  and  records.  The  finance  sector \nhas hailed the ordinance as a timely measure to direct the work of financial institutions in Nepal, \nwhich had been haphazard since the liberalization of the finance sector in the early 2000s.  \n \n\n2. \n\nInstitutional and Political Dimensions of RF Reforms \n\n \n4. \nThe evolution of the RF market in Nepal over the past three decades was driven by the goal \nto  accelerate  agriculture  production.  As  a  result,  the  development  of  efficient  institutions  was \nignored. The Government intervened in the market through directed credit, concessional refinance, \nand  loans  at  below-cost  interest  rates.  As  Nepal  Rastra  Bank  (NRB),  the  central  bank,  had  little \ncapability  to  enforce  relevant  regulations,  heavy-handed  state  involvement  worsened  the \ninefficiency  of  the  financial  sector.  This  resulted  in  growing  nonperforming  loans,  and  wider \nsystemic risk within the sector. The financial system generally has been seen as favoring the urban \nrich  and  the  rural  elite.  This  point  touches  on  one  of  the  reasons  for  the  insurgency,  and  has \nengendered resentment of central control in rural areas. \n \nB. \n \n5. \nThe  underlying  assumptions  in  analyzing  the  risks  to  the  Rural  Finance  Sector \nDevelopment Cluster Program are that (i) the Government will remain committed to reforming the \nfinancial sector, particularly in RF; (ii) the legal reforms implemented thus far in the finance sector \nwill  be  sustained;  and  (iii)  effective  institution  building  in  essential  agencies  will  proceed  as \nplanned. \n\nIdentification of Risks, Their Severity, and Mitigation Measures \n\n                                                 \n1   ADB. 2006. Second Governance and Anticorruption Action Plan (GACAP II). Manila. \n2  Supplementary Appendix F provides further details on the governance and anticorruption risk assessment. \n\n \n\n\f58 \n\nAppendix 6 \n\n1. \n\nRisk Specification \n\n6. \nundermine the success of the Project: \n \n\nA review of the political macro- and micro-economy shows six categories of risks that could \n\nPolicy. This includes lack of commitment to instituting needed RF reforms. \nRegulatory  framework  and  capability.  The  Government  might  not  have \nconsidered  thoroughly  the  regulatory  framework;  and  staff  capability  is  weak  in \nregulatory bodies that supervise and regulate RFIs. \nLegislation. This area includes the BFIO, which still has weaknesses. \nProcess. This includes the existence of asymmetric information, and the possibility \nof fraud and corruption. \nOrganization.  The  voluntary  retirement  scheme  at  the  Agricultural  Development \nBank Limited (ADBL) could run into problems due to union pressure; and the boards \nof RFIs could remain weak. \nProgrammatic.  ADBL  and  Small  Farmers  Development  Bank  could  implement \nfinancially or economically unsound concessions, write-offs, or waivers. \n\n7. \nRisks that are either wholly or partially uncontrollable by Government include (i) the security \nsituation at the local level, which remains tenuous, and might not allow RFIs to operate effectively \nin the field; (ii) Parliament might not push through financial reforms. \n \n\n2. \n\nRisk Severity and Mitigating Measures \n\nA  risk  severity  analysis  conducted  on  the  risks  of  (i)  \u2013  (vi)  of  para.  6  shows  the  following \n\n8. \ntype 1 risks3 that warrant specific attention at program design: \n \n\nWeak  staff  capacity  in  regulatory  bodies  to  monitor  and  engage  RFIs.  While \nthe  BFIO  does  give  NRB  considerable  powers  in  this  area,  the  central  bank  must \nhave  the  capacity  to  implement  the  rules  and  regulations  effectively.  Measures  to \naddress  this  risk  include  (a)  better  use  of  the  skills  and  expertise  base  in  NRB  to \nengage the RFIs (including reviewing the skill sets within the organization); and (b) \nmore targeted technical assistance to NRB for supervision and inspection of RFIs. \n\nLack  of  Government  commitment  to  reforms.  While  the  current  Government \nappears committed to reforms, much will be asked in this regard of this Government \nand  the  interim  one  to  be  formed  soon.  Strong  engagement  by  development \npartners  to  encourage  the  Government  to  stay  the  course,  and  incentives  (or \ndisincentives)  in  the  Program  for  committing  to  (or  opposing)  RF  reforms,  are  two \nways this risk can be mitigated. \n\nRegulatory framework not considered thoroughly. Current regulatory provisions \nare  stringent,  though  rules  and  regulations  have  to  be  prepared  rigorously  and \nimplemented  effectively.  To  strengthen  the  regulatory  framework,  NRB  should \ninspect ADBL at least once each fiscal year, and relevant BFIO provisions should be \nreviewed regularly and updated based on inspection lessons. \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\n \n\n                                                 \n3  A  risk  severity  analysis  identifies  four  types  of  risks.  Type  1  risks  require  urgent  attention  and  need  to  be \n\nmitigated/addressed before any assistance is rendered in the sector concerned. \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 6 \n\n59\n\n \n\n(iv)  Weak boards in RFIs. The selection of boards has not always been very effective. \nIf this problem recurs, RFIs would not be accountable or effective. The risk of weak \nRFI boards can be mitigated by, for example, using BFIO to remove the legislated \nmajority shareholding position of Government (thus reducing its scope of influence), \nand by ensuring strict adherence to nomination guidelines for board membership in \naccordance with company articles of association. \n\n \n(v)  Weak capacity in RFIs. RFIs do not appear capable of delivering the outcomes that \nhave been specified for them in the Program. Particular gaps include management \ninformation  systems,  loan  recovery  systems,  and  effective  human  resource \npractices.  These  weaknesses  can  be  mitigated  by \nimproving  management \ninformation  systems  and  accounting  systems  in  the  institutions,  introducing  career \nplanning  and  development  opportunities,  and  urgently  reviewing  pay  in  line  with \nperformance systems. \n\n \n(vi) \n\nRF  training  institution  lacks  sustainability.  Based  on  experience,  the  training \ninstitution to be established by the Program could run into difficulties sustaining its \noperations if a dedicated source of funding for its recurrent operational expenditure \nis  not  established.  Incorporating  the  RF  training  institution  as  a  limited  liability \ncompany  might  allow \nto  meet  recurrent \nexpenditure. \n\nto  generate  enough  resources \n\nit \n\nControls for Corruption in the Program  \n\n \nC. \n \nCorruption,  particularly  in  RF,  includes  pilferage  of  funds  and  irregularities  in  financial \n9. \nadministration,  rent-seeking  behavior  by  RFI  staff,  inadequate  reporting  and  accounting  systems, \nweak  procurement  and  tendering  processes,  and  inadequacies  in  full  fund  flow  management. \nHowever,  information  is  patchy  from  the  RFIs  in  Nepal  regarding  the  status  of  corruption  and \ninefficiencies in the RF sector. \n \n10. \ncorruption across all sectors, measures to mitigate the corruption risks in this Program include: \n \n\nIn  general,  however,  while  the  Government  has  made  some  recent  advances  in  fighting \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nStrengthened  audit  systems,  internally  through  the  audit  committee  in  the  Board, \nand externally through the auditor general. \nRigorous monitoring systems of operations on the ground through monitoring cells, \nas  well  as  internal  administrative  and  management  processes  through  continuous \nreview and evaluation of protocols. \nCapability  of  full  fund  flow  management,  which  allows  the  Program  to  track \nexpenditures  from  appropriation  to  final  output  and,  if  conducted  rigorously,  to \noutcomes as well.4 \nAdherence to codes of conduct by management and employees, and for the Board \nto initiate mechanisms to monitor the adherence. \nAccountability  for  action  and  outcomes  as  demonstrated  at  three  levels  by  (a) \nemployees  to  management;  (b)  management  to  the  Board;  and  (c)  the  Board  to \nParliament, and ultimately to the general public. \nIntegrated mechanisms for grassroots civil society organizations to monitor program \nresults during implementation. \n\n                                                 \n4  This allows the Project to minimize opportunities for corruption through a strong measurable results framework, where \n\nfund disbursements are tied to concrete and measurable results. \n\n \n\n\fRURAL FINANCE SECTOR DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM \nIMPLEMENTATION SCHEDULE \n\nYears\n\n2006\nN D J F M A M J J A S O N D J F M A M J J A S O N D J F M A M J J A S O N D J F M A M J J A S O N D J F M A M J J A S O N D\n\n2008\n\n2009\n\n2010\n\n2011\n\n2007\n\n6\n0\n \n\nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n7\n \n\ni\n\n1.2.

The development of a sound, sustainable RF sector is essential to extend \nbroad-based, pro-poor economic growth in the rural sector, and employment and income-generating opportunities to \npoor  in  rural  areas.  By  transforming  the  Agricultural  Development  Bank  Limited\u2014the  key  RF  institution  in  the \ncountry\u2014into  a  reliable  and  sustainable  RF  service  provider,  and  by  strengthening  its  rural  network,  the  delivery  of \nessential  financial  services  to  the  rural  sector  will  be  improved.  The  financial  services  will  support  rural  economic \nactivities,  and  reverse  negative  capital  flows  and  the  exodus  of  rural  migrants  to  urban  centers.  This  process  will \ninduce  increased  rural  household  asset  accumulation,  private  sector  development  (especially  micro  and  small \nenterprises), better income- and employment-generation opportunities, and improved rural livelihoods. \n\nTargeting Classification: General intervention \n\nB.  Poverty Analysis  \n \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?  \nNepal  is  an  overwhelmingly  rural  and  agrarian  economy.  More  than  85%  of  the  population  lives  in  rural  areas,  and \nnearly  80%  of  the  labor  force  is  engaged  in  agriculture  and  related  activities.  Smallholders  and  marginal  farmers \noperate 90% of the 2.7 million agricultural holdings. Agriculture sector growth has been low and employment\u2014farm or \nnon-farm\u2014is mainly in subsistence activities. This has resulted in a poverty incidence of 31% and a per capita gross \ndomestic  product  of  only  $292,  the  lowest  among  South  Asian  countries.  Further,  with  annual  population  growth  of \n2.2%,  Nepal  needs  to  absorb  about  300,000  new  laborers  a  year,  mostly  in  rural  areas.  An  estimated  17.6  million \npeople, or a majority of the population of Nepal, lack access to financial services. A fraction of the rural households \nhave access to institutional sources of financial services. The Government of Nepal plans to support enhancement of \nrural employment, add value to rural produce, and strengthen rural-urban economic links under its Tenth Plan (Poverty \nReduction Strategy Paper) 2002\u20132007. \n \nThe initial poverty analysis focused on small and marginal farmers in terms of their socioeconomic status, access to \nRF  services,  savings  habits,  and  level  of  savings  and  indebtedness.  The  poverty  analysis  identified  issues  and \nconstraints  faced  by  the  small  and  marginal  farmers,  including  women.  It  showed  that,  due  to  the  severely \nunderdeveloped formal financial sector and rural security concerns, a majority of the rural population has no access to \nformal  financial  services  (even  to  savings  products),  and/or  depend  on  informal  sources  of  finance  that  charge \nextremely  high  interest  rates.  Because  formal  institutional  credit  from  the  Government  and  nongovernment \norganizations  lacks  financial  discipline  and  sustainability,  it  achieves  marginal  outreach  to  the  rural  poor.  The \nprolonged  conflict  in  Nepal  severely  disrupted  access  to  financial  services,  especially  in  rural  areas.  Most  of  the \nfinancial institutions are reticent to operate in rural areas, and commercial banks have reduced the size of their rural \nnetworks  due  to  a  rationalization  of  their  operations.  As  a  result,  unmet  or  under-met  demands  for  formal  credit  for \ninvestment are considerable, constraining the poor\u2019s opportunities to  initiate gainful income-generating  activities  and \nimprove their social and economic welfare. During program appraisal, the poverty analysis was elaborated to develop \ntargets, strategies, and products to enhance the accessibility of RF by the poor, especially women.  \n\nC.  Participation Process \n\nIs there a stakeholder analysis? \nThe Program aims to enhance the access to RF services by the rural poor people, especially through the institutional \nreform  and  strengthening  of  important  RF  institutions  (RFI)\u2014Agricultural  Development  Bank  Limited.  and  Small \nFarmers  Development  Bank  (SFDB).  Institutional  and  operational  reviews  of  those  organizations  were  conducted  in \n2003, including a participatory client survey. Focused group interviews were undertaken to identify special needs and \ndemands for RF services by the rural poor. \n\n  Yes \n\n   No \n\nIs there a participation strategy? \nThe  restructuring  plan  for  SFDB,  a  main  microfinance  provider,  incorporates  a  participation  strategy  to  incorporate \nbeneficiary  clients\u2019  views  and  demands  into  SFDB\u2019s  operations.  In  addition,  the  policy  review  to  be  undertaken  will \naddress the issue of inclusion of the poor\u2019s needs and demands in the operations of RFIs. \n \n \n\n   Yes               \n\n   No \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 11 \n\n69 \n\nD.  Gender Development \n \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \n \nThe social analysis will include gender analysis to identify issues and constraints for women to access and utilize RF \nservices.  A  strategy  of  social  intermediation  was  prepared  during  program  appraisal  to  assess  special  support  to \nincrease women\u2019s accessibility to RF services, as well as training and skill development needs for women. \n \n\n \nHas an output been prepared?

The  Program  will \nhave  positive  impacts  on  resettlement  due  to  improved \nproductivity  in  agriculture  sector,  as  well  as  greater \nemployment \nemployment \nopportunities in the rural economy. \nRFSDCP will not create any affordability-related issues. In \ncontrast,  reduced  dependence  on  expensive  informal \nsources of credit will lower the prices of inputs and cost of \nproduction,  as  well  as  ensure  that  rural  households  are \nable  to  get  better  prices  for  their  produce.  The  reduced \ncost  of  production,  along  with  productivity  improvements, \nwill  result  in  a  competitive  rural  sector  that  will  not  be  as \ndependent  on  Government  subsidies  and  welfare \nprograms. \nEnhanced  outreach  as  a  result  of  RFI  restructuring  will \nincrease  rural  economic  activities,  leading  to  more  jobs. \nFurther  risk  mitigation  measures  to  be  provided  under \nRFSDCP  I  will  create  favorable  labor  conditions  in  rural \nagricultural and non-agriculture sectors. \n\nNo  adverse  issues  related  to  indigenous  people  are \nanticipated. Rather, indigenous people will benefit from an \nexpanded outreach of RF services. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n Full \n\n Short \n\n None \n\n Yes \n\n  No \n\n Yes \n\n  No  \n\n Yes \n\n  No \n\n Yes \n\n  No  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f", "author_pages": [" \n", " \n", " \n", " \n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n", " \n", " \n", "CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 24 September 2006) \n", "Currency Unit\nNRe1.00\n$1.00\n", "\u2013 \n= \n= \n", "Nepal rupee/s (NRe/NRs) \n$0.01 \nNRs73.72 \n", "For the purpose of calculations in this report, the rate of $1.00 = NRs74 was used. \n", "ADB \nADBL  \nADBN \nADF \nARP \nBAAC \nBFIO \nCBO \nCPN/M \nGBB \nGDP \nGTZ \nIDP \nIPO \nMFDB \nMFI \nMIS \nMOF \nNGO \nNRB \nPIU \nPMU \nPRGF \nPSC \nRF  \nRFI  \nRFSDCP \nRMDC \nSFCL \nSFDB \nSFDP \nSPO \nSPR \nTA \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "ABBREVIATIONS \n", "Asian Development Bank \nAgricultural Development Bank Limited  \nAgricultural Development Bank of Nepal \nAsian Development Fund \nAgricultural Development Bank Limited Restructuring Plan \nBank for Agriculture and Agricultural Cooperative \nBanks and Financial Institutions Ordinance  \ncommunity based organization \nCommunist Party of Nepal/Maoist \nGrameen Bikash Bank  \ngross domestic product  \nGesellschaft fur Technische Zusammenarbeit \ninstitutional development program \ninitial public offering \nmicrofinance development bank \nmicrofinance institution  \nmanagement information system  \nMinistry of Finance \nnongovernment organization  \nNepal Rastra Bank \nprogram implementation unit \nprogram management unit \nPoverty Reduction and Growth Facility  \nprogram steering committee \nrural finance \nrural finance institution  \nRural Finance Sector Development Cluster Program \nRural Microfinance Development Centre \nsmall farmers cooperative limited \nSmall Farmers Development Bank \nSmall Farmers Development Program \nsubprogram office \nsubprogram review \ntechnical assistance \n", " \nNOTES \n", "(i) \n", " \n(ii) \n", "The fiscal year (FY) of the Government ends on 15 July.
