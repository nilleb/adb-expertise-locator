The \nProject  consists  of  two  parts:  Part  A:  physical  infrastructure  and \nPart B: institutional development. Part A consists of 12 subprojects, \neach  covering  a  cluster  of  villages.  The  subprojects  will  include \ndeveloping  and  rehabilitating  piped  water  supply  systems,  public \nand  school  latrines,  and  wastewater  facilities.  Part  B  includes  a \ncapacity-building  program,  a  hygiene  and  sanitation  education \nprogram, and consulting services for project management support. \nThe  Project  will  cover  two  oblasts  (provinces),  Kashkadarya  and \nNavoi, and will provide basic WSS infrastructure services to about \n250,000  people,  about  30%  of  whom  are  living  below  the  poverty \nline. \n \nInadequate  delivery  of  rural  WSS  services  caused  by  aging \ninfrastructure,  institutional  constraints,  and  fiscal  difficulties  is \ninfrastructure \nto  basic  WSS \ninhibiting  communities\u2019  access \nservices.  Existing \nfacilities  are  often  poorly  designed  and \ninsufficiently  maintained,  and  do  not  adequately  provide  urgently \nneeded basic services. In line with the Government\u2019s policy to use \na decentralized community management approach, the Project will \nenhance coverage of basic WSS facilities; contribute to improving \nliving and health conditions, in particular for the poor; and improve \nthe  institutional,  organizational,  and  managerial  capabilities  of  the \noblasts.  The  sector  lending  modality  is  considered  appropriate \nbecause  (i)  the  Government\u2019s  sector  policies,  strategies,  and  the \n10-year investment plan for the sector are satisfactory to the Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB),  and  (ii)  the  Uzbekistan  Communal \nServices  Agency  (UCSA)  has  gained  substantial  experience  and \ncapacity  through  implementing  the  World  Bank  water  supply \nproject and an ongoing ADB water supply project. \n\n\fiv \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n \nCost Estimates \n\n \nFinancing Plan \n\nfor  WSS \n\nThe impact of the Project is to improve living conditions and public \nhealth  in  rural  areas  of  Kashkadarya  and  Navoi  oblasts.  The \noutcome  of  the  Project  is  improved  access  to  WSS  in  project \nareas.  The  Project  will  assist  the  Government  in  (i)  implementing \ninfrastructure  services;  and  (ii) \ninstitutional  reform \nproviding  and  upgrading  reliable  and  financially  sustainable  WSS \nservices \nimprove  public  health,  promote  economic \ndevelopment, and reduce rural poverty. \n \nThe  estimated  project  cost  is  $36.0  million  equivalent,  comprising \nforeign  exchange  costs  of  $5.6  million  and  local  currency  costs \nequivalent to $30.4 million. \n \n\nthat  will \n\n($ million equivalent) \n\nForeign \nExchange\n\nLocal \nCurrency \n19.4 \n\nTotal \nCost \n25.0 \n\n5.6 \n\n \n0.0 \n \n0.0 \n\n \n10.1 \n \n0.9 \n\n \n10.1 \n \n0.9 \n\nPercent \n\n69.4 \n\n \n28.0 \n \n2.6 \n\nSource of Fund \n\nA.

Project  implementation  will  be  carried  out  by  the  oblast \nproject implementation units to be established in Kashkadarya and \nNavoi  oblasts.  A  project  steering  committee  will  be  established  to \nmonitor  project  implementation  and  ensure  coordination  with \ngovernment policies and other programs. \n \n\n \nPeriod of Utilization \n \nEstimated Project \nCompletion Date \n \nExecuting Agency \n \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\n \n\n\fProcurement \n\n \nConsulting Services \n\n \nProject Benefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\nv\nv \n\n(iii) \n\nThe procurement of civil works, goods, and services to be financed \nby  the  ADB  loan  will  be  undertaken  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines  for  Procurement.  International  competitive  bidding \nprocedures will be applied for supply contracts estimated to cost at \nleast  $1  million  equivalent.  Supply  contracts  worth  less  than \n$1 million equivalent will follow international shopping procedures, \nexcept  for  supply  contracts  with  a  value  of  less  than  $100,000 \nequivalent,  which  may  be  procured  by  direct  purchase.  Local \ncompetitive  bidding  procedures  will  be  applied  for  civil  works \ncontracts that are valued at less than $2 million.  \n \nThe  Project  will  require  680  person-months  of  consulting  services \n(50  person-months  of  international  and  630  person-months  of \ndomestic)  for  (i)  review  of  detailed  design,  (ii)  construction \nsupervision, \n(iv)  community \nfinance  and  accounting, \ndevelopment, and (v) project management. The consultants will be \nengaged  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants  using  quality  and  cost  based  selection  (QCBS)  and \nother  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  the  engagement  of \ndomestic consultants. \n \nThe  Project  is  expected  to  benefit  170  villages  with  populations \nranging  from  300  to  8,000.  Overall,  about  250,000  people,  about \n30% of whom are living below the poverty line, will benefit directly \nfrom  the  Project  through  provision  of  potable  quality  piped  water \nsupply  facilities;  improved  wastewater  drainage  facilities;  and \npublic, school, and private latrines. The Project will improve health \nconditions  by  reducing  waterborne  diseases.  Related  benefits \ninclude  time  and  cost  savings  from  purchasing,  fetching,  treating, \nand storing water; improved public and family hygiene and health; \nreduced  medical  outlays;  and  increased  productivity  days.  The \ncore  subprojects\u2019  economic  internal  rate  of  return  is  23%  to  36%. \nSupport  for  decentralized  community  management  and  capacity \nbuilding will enhance the efficiency and sustainability of rural WSS \nservices in Uzbekistan. \n \n\n \nRisks and Assumptions  Three  possible  risks  have  been  identified.  First,  the  possibility  of \ndelays  in  project  implementation  caused  by  weak  institutional \ncapability  to  implement,  operate,  and  maintain  the  water  supply \nsystems  has  been  addressed  through  clear  delineation  of  agency \ninclusion  of  coordination  mechanisms. \nresponsibilities  and \nConsiderable  preparatory  work  has  been  undertaken  in  potential \nsubproject  communities  regarding  the  current  status  of  water \nsupply facilities, and an initial assessment of required development \nhas  been  carried  out.  Substantial  support  will  be  provided  for \ncapacity  building \ntraining  programs  and  consulting \nservices.  \n \n\nthrough \n\n \n\n\fSecond,  potential  for  delays  in  project  implementation  caused  by \nlack  of  local  counterpart  funds  has  been  addressed  by  the  active \nparticipation of local administration which meets some construction \nsupervision  and  all  land  requirements.  Measures  to  reduce \npossible delays have been discussed with the Government.   \n \nThird, limited financial capability to meet the incremental operation \nand  maintenance  (O&M)  of  the  expanded  water  supply  systems \nhas  been  managed  by  including  the  institutional  development \nprogram, which should strengthen the capacity to undertake O&M \nof the expanded water supply systems. The Project will be closely \nmonitored, with two reviews per year throughout implementation. \n \n\nvi \n\n \n\n \n\n

\n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n \n1. \nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nthe Republic of Uzbekistan for the Kashkadarya and Navoi Rural Water Supply and Sanitation \nSector Project. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n\n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n \nA. \n \n2. \nThe  Government\u2019s  development  objectives  are  to  promote  economic  growth,  reduce \npoverty,  and  provide  balanced  regional  development\u2014including  improved  water  supply  and \nsanitation (WSS) services. The country\u2019s WSS facilities are often poorly designed, inadequately \nmaintained,  and  in  a  poor  state  of  repair.  Rural  water  supply  has  particularly  suffered  from \nbudget  cuts  since  independence.  Formerly,  an  estimated  70%  of  all  rural  villages  had  piped \npotable water supply. Lack of funding for operation and maintenance (O&M) is the main reason \nthat  many  water  supply  systems  are  constantly  out  of  service.  In  spite  of  the  Government\u2019s \nefforts  to  reestablish  the  level  of  water  supply  service,  the  percentage  of  villages  with  piped \nwater supply is currently relatively low. Rural areas in the oblasts of Kashkadarya and Navoi are \nparticularly poorly served with piped water supply. Recent surveys show that only about 30% of \nvillages in Kashkadarya and Navoi oblasts have access to piped water supply. Annual funding \nto  the  sector  is  generally  limited  to  routine  maintenance  and  repairs.  The  level  of  tariffs\u2014\ntargeted to cover O&M costs\u2014is low, collection management is poor, and insufficient money is \nraised to support efficient operation.  \n \n3. \nLack  of  adequate  WSS  services  also  has  a  large  negative  impact  on  community  health, \nespecially  the  poor.  In  rural  areas,  people  often  have  to  walk  long  distances  only  to  obtain \ncontaminated  water  from  untreated  sources.  There  are  few  wastewater  collection  systems  in \nrural  areas  and  waste  disposal  infrastructure  is  below  acceptable  standards.  Insufficient  and \npolluted  drinking  water  supplies,  combined  with  poor  sanitation  and  hygiene  practices,  are \ndirectly  linked  to  the  high  incidence  of  waterborne  diseases.  As  a  consequence  of  major \ngovernment  reforms  in  the  health  sector  since  1998,  expected  life  expectancy  at  birth  has \nincreased  and  the  infant  mortality  rate  has  decreased  substantially.  Nevertheless,  maternal, \nchild,  and  infant  mortality  remain  high.  Water-related  diseases  such  as  hepatitis  A,  typhoid \nfever,  skin  allergies,  and  kidney  disease  are  widespread,  particularly  in  rural  areas.  In  the \nKashkadarya and Navoi oblasts, indicators of infectious morbidity remain significantly high.  \n \nB. \n \n4. \nSector Policies. Since the promulgation of the Law on Water and Water Use, 1993, the \nGovernment  has  gradually  extended  and  strengthened  the  legislative  framework  covering \nUzbekistan\u2019s needs in the WSS sector, particularly in rural areas. Needs include improvement of \nphysical and institutional structures, promotion of sector decentralization, conservation of water \nresources,  and  implementation  of  sound  tariff  and  cost-recovery  policies.  Uzbekistan\u2019s  WSS \npolicy  is  now  underpinned  by  three  legal  instruments:  (i)  the  national  10-year  water  supply \ndevelopment  plan  approved  by  the  Cabinet  of  Ministers  in  1999,  (ii)  the  Resolution  of  the \nCabinet  of  Ministers  approved  in  2003  (RCM)  No.  405,  and  (iii)  the  latest  annual  public \ninvestment program approved by the Cabinet of Ministers. \n \n5. \nThe key objectives of the WSS policy are to: (i) improve water sector services through a \nnational  water  supply  development  plan;  (ii)  attain  financial  sustainability  through  an  effective \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\n\ftariff  system  and  cost  recovery;  (iii)  plan  adequate  investments  with  domestic  and  external \nfunding;  (iv)  achieve  further  decentralization  of  WSS  services;  (v)  encourage  private  sector \nparticipation and public-private partnerships in the sector; (vi) implement hygiene and sanitation \neducation programs in schools; (vii) achieve improved livelihood conditions, particularly for the \nbenefit  of  women  in  rural  areas;  (viii)  ensure  environmental  compliance  by  encouraging \nconservative development of water resources, economic use of water, consistent water quality \ncontrol, and sound management of wastewater; and (ix) improve further operational strategies \nby strengthening the sector\u2019s institutional setup and interagency collaboration, and by promoting \nadequate capacity building. A summary of Uzbekistan\u2019s WSS policy is in Appendix 2 and a full \ndescription is in Supplementary Appendix A. \n \n6. \nThe Government is targeting the Millennium Development  Goal to ensure environmental \nsustainability  and  aims  to  halve  the  number  of  people  without  sustainable  access  to  safe \ndrinking  water  by  2010.  Currently,  access  to  safe  drinking  water  is  estimated  at  30%  in  rural \nareas  and  70%  in  urban  areas.  The  overall  goal  of  the  Government's  WSS  sector  plan  is  to \nimprove the health and living conditions of the population by providing better access to safe and \nadequate  amounts  of  water  supply,  and  better  sanitation  services.  To  achieve  this  goal,  the \nfollowing  objectives  must  be  met:  (i)  invest  in  the  development  of  WSS  infrastructure, \nparticularly in rural areas; (ii) undertake institutional reforms necessary for effective and efficient \ndevelopment and operation of WSS; (iii) implement a system of equitable and transparent tariff \nsetting based on cost recovery objectives, taking into account the needs of the poor; (v) develop \neffective  implementation  mechanisms,  including  cost  recovery  for  WSS  in  market  conditions; \nand (vi) involve the private sector in WSS management.  \n \nSector Investment Plan. The national water supply development plan is based on three \n7. \nbasic documents: (i) the 10-year water supply development plan approved by the Government \nin 1999; (ii) the 2003 law providing additional measures to improve of the supply of water and \nnatural gas to rural settlements (RCM No. 405); and (iii) the latest annual investment program \napproved  by  the  Cabinet  of  Ministers.  Under  its  WSS  policy,  the  Government  committed  to  a  \n10-year  program  (2000\u20132010)  aimed  at  improving  the  supply  of  water  to  urban  and  rural \ncommunities,  many  of  which  currently  have  inadequate  or  no  water  supply.  This  program, \ndeveloped  in  1999  and  modified  in  2003,  envisages  the  construction  of  water  supply  systems \nand  the  improvement  of  the  level  of  service  of  drinking  water  supply  to  benefit  up  to  85%  of \nUzbekistan\u2019s rural population.  \n \n8. \nIn  implementing  the  water  supply  development  plan,  the  Government  has  placed \nparticular emphasis on the: (i) development of long-distance, interregional transmission mains, \ncarrying water from its source to urban and rural settlements where no fresh water is available; \n(ii) coverage of a significant part of the urban and rural population with water supply by 2010, \nand full coverage of the rural population by 2020; and (iii) rehabilitation of water supply networks \nin urban centers. Under the plan, the Government estimated the total cost of reconstruction of \nthe  urban  water  supply  sector  at  $896  million  until  2005,  with  an  additional  $1,527  million \nrequired  from  2006  to  2010.  The  cost  of  rehabilitation  of  the  rural  water  supply  sector  was \nestimated  at  $930  million  (until  2005)  and  $1,706  million  (2006\u20132010).  To  date,  about \n$433 million  has  been  committed  by  the  Government  for  rehabilitation  and  extension  of  the \nlong-distance  water  transmission  mains.  Concerning  the  long-term  investment  plan,  the  2005 \ninvestment  plan  includes  the  estimated  costs  of  planned  post-2010  investments,  covering \n12 WSS projects totaling $363.3 million. An estimated additional $700 million would be needed \nto  cover  the  remaining  rural  areas  with  water  supply  by  2020.  In  pursuing  the  objectives  of \nimplementing the plan, the Government has undertaken steps aimed at diversifying investments \nand  sources  of  funding.  This  includes  attracting  international  funding,  which  is  expected  to  be \n\n2 \n\n \n\n\f3 \n\nprovided  mainly  by  ADB  and  the World  Bank,  as  well  as bilateral  donors.  The summary  WSS \nsector  investment  plan  is  in  Appendix  3  and  the  detailed  sector  investment  plan  is  in \nSupplementary Appendix B. \n \nSector  Institutions.  Several  government  agencies  are  involved  in  the  development  and \n9. \noperations of the WSS sector. The Uzbekistan Communal Services Agency (UCSA) is the main \nagency responsible for WSS sector development and protection of water sources. UCSA covers \ntasks  ranging  from  regulatory  to  commercial  including:  (i)  provision  of  regulatory  advice  and \nsupport  to  reforms  in  the  communal  services  sector,  (ii)  monitoring  the  compliance  of  local \nauthorities and commercial entities with sector policies, and (iii) attracting foreign investment in \nthe sector. The Ministry of Health (MOH) is responsible for implementation of the Government\u2019s \nhealth  and  hygiene  policies,  and  monitors  water  quality  through  the  State  Sanitary  and \nEpidemiological Inspectorate which has branches at oblast and rayon (district) levels. The State \nCommittee for Geology and Mineral Resources is responsible for controlling the exploitation of \ngroundwater sources, and the State Committee for Environmental Protection is responsible for \nensuring compliance with quality standards in natural water resources. The oblast governments \nare  responsible  for  O&M  of  rural  WSS  facilities  through  oblast  and  rayon  vodokanals  (water \nsupply and sanitation agencies). \n \n10.  Capacity  of  the  Executing  Agency.  The  Executing  Agency  (EA)  for  the  Project,  the \nUCSA,  has  the  technical,  financial,  and  managerial  capability  to  implement  the  Project  and \nmanage  the  newly  constructed  rural  water  supply  systems  in  the  long  term,  ensuring:  (i) \naffordable cost recovery, (ii) sound water tariff policies, and (iii) appropriate management of the \nnewly constituted WSS utilities. UCSA will have the authority to delegate responsibilities to the \noblast  level.  Kashkadarya  and  Navoi  oblasts  have  adequate  personnel  available  and  will  be \ncontributing  financially  to  the  Project.  UCSA  has  the  capacity  to  establish  the  institutional \nstructures  required  at  the  recipient  level  in  a  timely  and  appropriate  manner,  and  is  also \nequipped to provide the necessary capacity building. UCSA currently satisfies ADB\u2019s minimum \nto \nfinancial  management  requirements  and  has \nsatisfactorily  record  all  transactions  and  balances,  support  the  preparation  of  regular  and \nreliable  financial  statements  and  financial  monitoring  reports,  and  arrange  for  annual  audits  to \nbe carried out in a manner acceptable to ADB. The summary assessment of UCSA\u2019s capacity is \nin Appendix 4 and a detailed assessment is in Supplementary Appendix C. \n \n11.  Lessons Learned. Experience from other externally assisted projects in Uzbekistan and \nADB's  experience  in  similar  projects  indicates  that  the  main  problems  faced  during  the \nimplementation  of  large-scale  rural  WSS  services  projects  relate  to  insufficient  community \nconsultation  and  participation  in  the  planning  and  design  of  subprojects.  This  contributes  to \nnonfunctioning  or  nonestablishment  of  local  utility  agencies,  lack  of  guarantees  for  O&M \nfinancing,  inadequate  O&M,  and  weak  cost  recovery.  The  need  to  focus  on  sustainability  of \nin  project \noperations  has  been \nimplementation  has  led  to  delays  and  slow  disbursement  in  some  projects.  Another  lesson \nlearned  concerns  the  institutional  capacity  of  oblast  governments,  which  lack  familiarity  with \nADB\u2019s  implementation  procedures  and  require  training  and  technical  support.  These  issues \nwere  reviewed  during  project  processing,  and  comprehensive  measures  have  been \nincorporated  in  the  project  design.  The  Government,  ADB,  and  other  donor  agencies  are \ncurrently  focusing  on  community  consultation  and  decentralization  of  implementation.  External \nassistance to the sector is in Appendix 5. \n \n12.  Policy Dialogue. A key rationale for ADB support for the sector is ADB\u2019s policy dialogue \nwith  the  Government  and  the  fact  that  ADB  support  for  WSS  is  provided  in  a  policy  context. \n\nfinancial  management  capability \n\nlimited  government  experience \n\nrecognized.  Further, \n\nthe \n\n \n\n\fPolicy  dialogue  with  the  Government  in  the  WSS  sector  has  covered  capacity  building, \ndecentralization,  ensuring  a  poverty  focus,  and  institutional  and  financial  sustainability. \nSupplementary  Appendix  D  provides  the  policy  framework  addressing  issues  and  actions \nrequired. The Government has agreed to rehabilitate and expand existing WSS infrastructure in \npoor  rural  areas  using  simple,  least-cost  solutions.  Policy  dialogue  has  also  covered \ndevelopment of local WSS services and the need for further rehabilitation and extension of long-\ndistance water supply transmission mains. Updating of national groundwater resources data is \nessential  for  the  planned  decentralization  of  small-scale  water  supply  systems,  which  would \nenhance their economic viability. \n \n13.  From  the  institutional  point  of  view,  the  Project  is  designed  to  increase  local-level \nresponsibilities for WSS infrastructure services by decentralizing implementation and O&M, and \nactively  involving  all  stakeholders.  Policy  dialogue  has  covered  local-level  O&M  of  WSS \ninfrastructure  facilities,  and  communities  will  be  involved  in  O&M  of  the  constructed  facilities \nthrough  their  newly  created  Drinking  Water  Consumers  Unions  (DWCUs).  The  process  of \ndecentralization of responsibilities in the WSS sector requires a corresponding strengthening of \nthe  sector  institutions  at  central  level\u2014but  particularly  at  oblast  level\u2014to  provide  close \nmonitoring of the performance of the new DWCUs and undertake correction measures for poor \nperformers. \n \n14.  Sector  Lending  Approach.  The  Project  has  been  formulated  in  line  with  the \nGovernment\u2019s  sector  policies,  strategy,  and  investment  plan.  The  Government  has  well \nformulated water sector policies, development objectives, and an approach to rural water supply \ninfrastructure development, as well as a development plan for the WSS sector. UCSA, the EA, \nhas  significant  experience  in  implementing  similar  projects  supported  by  the  World  Bank  and \nADB, and has the capability to implement the sector investment plan. The Government has met \nthe  three  requirements  for  sector  lending:  (i)  a  sector  development  plan,  (ii)  the  institutional \ncapacity to implement the plan, and (iii) appropriate sector policies.  \n \n15.  ADB  has  reviewed  4  of  the  12  prospective  subprojects  to  confirm  the  approaches, \nmethodology,  and  procedures  of  subproject  selection  and  appraisal\u2014Kamashi  and  Kasan \nsubprojects  in  Kashkadarya  oblast,  and  Kyzyltepa  and  Nurota  subprojects  in  Navoi  oblast. \nKamashi  and  Kasan  subprojects  are  supplied  with  groundwater  from  local  trunk  main \nShakhrisbz-Karshi-Mubarak  developed  at  the  existing  wellfield  of  Shahkrizabs.  A  list  of \nsubprojects  is  in  Supplementary  Appendix  E.  The  Navoi  subproject  is  fed  from  trunk  main \nDamkhodj while the Nurota subproject is supplied with groundwater from production wells. The \nsubprojects  are  viable  in  terms  of  technical,  institutional,  social,  financial,  economic,  and \nenvironmental  aspects.  The  remaining  8 subprojects  are  being  formulated  in  accordance  with \nthe  agreed  selection  criteria  and  appraisal  procedures  (Supplementary  Appendix  F),  which \ninclude:  (i)  preparation  of  a  feasibility  study;  and  (ii)  appraisal,  including  preparation  of  a \nsubproject appraisal report.  \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n \nA. \n \n16.  The impact of the Project is to improve living conditions and public health in rural areas of \nKashkadarya and Navoi oblasts. The outcome of the Project is improved access to WSS in the \nproject areas. The Project will upgrade service levels and delivery efficiency, and achieve better \ncost recovery by providing capacity building and project management support. The Project will \nassist  the  Government  in  (i)  implementing  institutional  reform  for  WSS  infrastructure  services; \n\n4 \n\n \n\n\f5 \n\nOutputs \n\nand  (ii)  providing  and  upgrading  reliable  and  financially  sustainable  WSS  services  that  will \nimprove  public  health,  promote  economic  development,  and  reduce  rural  poverty.  The  project \narea will cover Kashkadarya and Navoi oblasts, which have significant levels of poverty (38% in \nKashkadarya and 24% in Navoi) and an identified demand for development of WSS services.  \n \nB. \n \n17.  The Project consists of two parts: Part A: Physical Infrastructure; and Part B: Institutional \nDevelopment,  which  includes  a  capacity-building  program,  a  hygiene and  sanitation  education \n(HSE)  program,  and  consulting  services  for  project  management  support.  Summary  feasibility \nstudies and short descriptions of the four core subprojects are in Supplementary Appendix G. \n \n\n1. \n\nPart A: Physical Infrastructure  \n\n \n18.  Part A includes 12 subprojects, covering about 170 villages with populations ranging from \n300 to 8,000, a total of about 250,000. Each subproject will cover a cluster of up to 20 villages \nwithin  one  rayon  and  comprise  an  integrated  water  supply  system,  including  improvement  of \nsanitation  facilities.  The  subprojects  will  consist  of  the  development  or  rehabilitation  and \nupgrading  of  piped  water  supply  systems,  construction  of  public  and  school  latrines,  and \nparticipatory improvement of wastewater drainage facilities. The development and expansion of \nthe water supply systems will include construction and/or rehabilitation of water source intakes, \nconstruction  of  pumping  stations,  treatment  facilities,  storage  reservoirs,  transmission  and \ndistribution  pipelines,  and  individual  yard  or  house  connections.  The  subprojects  will  derive \nsupplies from different types of water sources. Most subprojects will use groundwater sources, \nand  will  require  development  and/or  rehabilitation  of  water  supply  systems  and  drilling  of \nproduction  wells.  The  new  development  of  water  supply  will  be  coordinated  with  wastewater \ndrainage measures consisting of basic improvements to village drainage networks. Public and \nschool toilets will be rehabilitated and, where feasible, connected to septic tanks.  \n \n19.  The physical infrastructure component will cover around 10% of the approximately 1,700 \nvillages  in  the  two  project  oblasts.  About  1,200  villages  (70%)  do  not  have  any  formal  piped \nwater supply system, while the remaining 500 villages (30%) are supplied from trunk mains or \nlocal  sources.  About  11%  (250,000)  of  the  total  rural  population  in  the  project  oblasts \n(2.2 million) will  be  covered  by  the  12  subprojects.  Of  the  12  subprojects\u2014each  involving  one \nrayon and an integrated water supply system covering up to 20 villages\u20147 systems will utilize \ngroundwater sources distributed from trunk mains and 5 will be supplied from local groundwater \nsources. On average, the per capita investment cost is about $140.  \n \n20.  Settlements in the project area are divided into three major categories: (i) settlements in \nareas  without  groundwater  resources,  which  can  be  supplied  by  long-distance  interregional  or \nregional  trunk  mains;  (ii)  settlements  that  can  be  supplied  from  a  locally  developed  water \nresource (essentially groundwater); and (iii) settlements in remote areas whose only alternative \nsupply is the desalination of locally available salinized groundwater. In selecting settlements for \nthe  subprojects,  priority  is  given  to  settlements  with  no  water  supply  or  a  nonworking  water \nsupply  system,  located  near  a  reliable  source  of  fresh  water.  In  addition,  the  following  criteria \nare  included  in  subproject  selection:  (i)  settlements  with  low-income  level,  (ii)  willingness \nexpressed  by  locals  to  have  an  improved  water  supply  system  and  establish  a  DWCU,  and \n(iii) settlements included in the government strategy program.1 Preliminary lists of villages to be \nincluded in the subprojects have been established in consultation with oblast, rayon, and local \n\n                                                 \n1  Resolution of the Cabinet of Ministers (RCM) No. 405 of 17 September 2003. \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\nauthorities.  The  subprojects  will  have  environmental  clearances  from  the  State  Committee  for \nNature  Protection  and  approval  by  the  Cabinet  of  Ministers.  The  proposed  schemes  do  not \nrequire displacement of houses but there will be some permanent and temporary land impacts. \nDesign schemes will use appropriate technology and represent the least-cost solution. \n \n21.  UCSA  will  submit  and  obtain  ADB\u2019s  prior  approval  for  subproject  proposals.  UCSA  will \ngive  ADB  an  application  for  the  approval  of  these  subprojects,  containing  a  description  and \nappraisal  of  the  subproject  proposal.  All  subprojects  will  be  appraised  by  the  project \nmanagement  unit  (PMU)  within  UCSA  and  approved  by  the  project  coordination  committee \n(PCC). Only those subprojects found viable will be endorsed for implementation. Documentation \nrelating  to  the  subproject  proposals  will  be  retained  by  UCSA  and  made  available  to  ADB  on \nrequest. \n \n22.  The subprojects are located within five rayons in Navoi and seven rayons in Kashkadarya, \nwhere  there  is  a  significantly  high  percentage  of  poverty  and  water  supply  coverage  is \nparticularly low. A total of 12 subprojects has been identified. Subproject appraisal will adopt an \napproach which takes into account ADB procedures for investment of project loans and national \nguidelines  for  project  feasibility  studies.2  Each  subproject  is  located  within  a  rayon  and \nsettlements within a given subproject are supplied from one type of water source (local sources \nor  trunk  mains).  This  will  facilitate  obtaining  construction  permits,  water  rights,  and  more \nparticularly  the  establishment  of  technical  support  for  O&M  of  pumps  and  dispatching  centers \nbased at the rayon vodokanal. It will also facilitate contract packaging and tendering.  \n \n\n2. \n\nPart B: Institutional Development \n\n \n23.  Capacity-Building  Program.  The  capacity-building  program  will  be  carried  out  by  the \nUCSA, assisted by the consultants. It involves preparation of training programs, and training of \ncentral  and  local  government  staff  and  other  stakeholders  to  strengthen  their  capacity  to \nefficiently plan, implement, operate, and maintain the WSS systems. The program will provide: \n(i) on-the-job O&M training for operators of the new systems with emphasis on improved water \nquality  testing  and  environmental  issues;  (ii)  training  of  UCSA,  PMU,  project  implementation \nunits  (PIUs),  and  DWCU  management  in  project  planning,  financial  management,  and \naccounting;  and  (iii)  training  of  design  institutes  in  improved  project  appraisal,  design,  and \nprocurement  procedures  in  accordance  with  ADB  guidelines.  The  program  will  focus  on  four \nareas:  (i)  O&M  training,  emphasizing  economic  use  of  water;  (ii)  gradual  expansion  of  the \ninstitutional  structure,  including  assistance  to  local  governments;  (iii)  development  of  local \ngovernments\u2019  planning,  engineering,  and  financial  capability;  and  (iv)  strengthening  the \nGovernment\u2019s health education program. Under the capacity-building activities, the DWCUs will \nbe  constituted  and  trained  in  each  subproject  area.  About  170  central  and  local  government \nstaff  will  be  trained.  A  capacity  building  framework  indicating  the  main  training  topics,  target \nagencies, and stakeholders is in Supplementary Appendix H. \n \n24.  Hygiene  and  Sanitation  Education  Program.  The  HSE  program  will  help  beneficiaries \nto improve their understanding of the close interrelationship between hygiene, water, sanitation, \nand  health.  The  program  will  be  formulated  by  the  PMU  and  staff  of  health  care  authorities \nresponsible  for  surveillance  of  drinking  water  quality  and  sanitation  and  hygiene  surveillance, \nassisted  by  the  consultants.  The  HSE  program  will  include:  (i)  the  dissemination  of  media \nmaterials  covering  selected  hygiene,  sanitation, and  water-related  issues;  (ii)  HSE workshops, \n\n                                                 \n2  RCM  No.  538  of  2  December  2003  on  procedures  for  developing,  conducting,  examining,  and  assembling \n\ndocumentation for investment programs. \n\n\f7 \n\nSpecial Features \n\norientation, and training of rayon and village health staff, village leaders, and school teachers in \nall  selected  communities;  (iii)  equipping  selected  health  posts  and  schools  with  materials  and \nsoftware for training; and (iv) development and implementation of an HSE program in schools. \nAbout 200 people, including school teachers and MOH staff will be trained. The HSE program \nwill benefit an estimated 4,000 schoolchildren. \n \n25.  Project  Management  Support.  Consultants  will  be  contracted  to  help  implement  the \nProject,  provide  project  management  support,  and  strengthen  the  implementing  capacity  of \nsector  agencies  concerned.  The  services  will:  (i)  help  in  project  management  and  monitoring, \n(ii) assist  in  construction  supervision  of  subprojects,  and  (iii)  support  the  planning  and \nimplementation  of  the  capacity-building  and  HSE  program.  UCSA  will  involve  at  least  two \nnongovernment  organizations  (NGOs)3  in  consulting  services  for  community  consultation, \ndevelopment  of  subproject  planning,  and  monitoring  subprojects;  and  to  assist  in  capacity \nbuilding.  \n \nC. \n \n26.  ADB  Water  Policy.  The  Project  supports  and  strengthens  several  principal  elements  of \nADB's  water  policy,4  including:  (i)  promoting  a  national  focus  on  water  sector  reform, \n(ii) improving  and  expanding  water  service  delivery,  (iii)  fostering  water  conservation  and \nincreasing  system  efficiencies,  and  (iv)  improving  governance  through  decentralization  and \ncapacity-building.  The  Project  incorporates  technology  taking  into  account  the  local  conditions \nand  limited  capacity  of  local  governments.  Community  consultations  ensure  that  technologies \nwill be investigated and adopted prior to implementation. Such an approach helps ensure that \ntechnically appropriate and acceptable systems are sustainable. The type of technology for the \nsystems  will  be  guided  by  the  design  criteria.  When  preparing  the  subprojects,  sanitary \nconditions in the subproject area were also reviewed. The sanitation components provide for the \ndevelopment and rehabilitation of public and school sanitation facilities. \n \n27.  Private  Sector  Participation.  The  private  sector  will  participate  in  providing  basic \ninfrastructure  services  under  the  Project.  Services  of  local  design  institutes,  suppliers,  and \ncontractors will be procured. The Government will encourage the development of (i) a diversified \nprivate  consulting  capacity,  by  fostering  the  transformation  of  present  research  and  design \ninstitutes  into  better  performing  private  engineering  agencies;  (ii)  a  responsive  and  efficient \nindustry  to  supply  quality  equipment  and  materials,  by  accelerating  the  privatization  of  state \nequipment  manufacturers  and  material  suppliers;  (iii)  strong  civil  works  contractors  capable  of \nproviding  quality  services,  by  (a)  strengthening  existing  civil  works  contractors  in  rural  areas, \n(b) adopting  mandatory  competitive  procurement  procedures  for  public  enterprises  such  as \nwater utilities, (c) strengthening technical specifications, and (d) introducing stricter supervision \nof  construction;  (iv)  small-scale  entrepreneurs  who  can  offer  community  services  in  the \nconstruction and O&M of water supply systems and sanitation facilities; and (v) NGOs that can \ncontribute to WSS development. \n \n28.  O&M, Cost Recovery, and Affordability. Sustainable O&M of water supply facilities is a \nmajor problem, especially in rural areas. Analysis of willingness-to-pay (WTP) and affordability \nfor the subprojects shows that a large majority of rural inhabitants in project villages is willing to \npay  for  improved  water  supply.  Full  O&M  cost  recovery  is  expected  to  be  feasible  on \ncommencement  for  the  subprojects,  including  depreciation  in  the  next  5\u201310  years,  through \n\n                                                 \n3  Women\u2019s committees and elders\u2019 councils have tentatively been proposed. \n4  ADB. 2001.

The  project  design  also  incorporates  organization  at  the  local \ngovernment  level,  including  establishment  of  DWCUs,  systematic  staff  training,  preparation  of \nO&M  manuals,  and  periodic  monitoring  of  operations  (including  consumer  satisfaction).  The \ncapacity-building  program  will  establish  proper  procedures  for  the  collection  of  fees  and \nsanctions  for  nonpayment.  The  charges  will  be  affordable  for  all  customers.  Households  with \nhouse or yard connections will be charged a higher fee than poorer households served by public \nstandpipes. Installation of water  meters and adjustment of the tariff system will promote water \nconservation.  Socioeconomic  surveys  to  be  undertaken  as  part  of  the  subproject  design  will \nfacilitate beneficiary involvement and enable the determination of an appropriate and affordable \nservice level. Participation of community representatives and other stakeholders will ensure that \nthe costs of the investment and O&M will be known to the communities. \n \nD. \n \n29.  The total project cost is estimated at $36.0 million equivalent, of which $5.6 million is the \nforeign  exchange  cost  and  $30.4  million  equivalent  is  the  local  currency  cost.  The  cost \nestimates  include  interest  and  other  charges  during  construction,  as  well  as  taxes  and  duties. \nThe  subprojects  included  under  the  Project  represent  least-cost  solutions.

The  Government  has  requested  a  loan  of  $25.0  million  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds \nresources  to  help  finance  the  Project.  The  loan  will  have  a  32-year  term,  including  a  grace \nperiod  of  8  years,  an  interest  charge  of  1%  per  annum  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5%  per \nannum  thereafter.  ADB  will  finance  69.4%  of  the  total  estimated  project  cost  of  $36.0  million. \nThe  ADB  loan  will  cover  the  entire  foreign  exchange  cost  ($5.6  million)  and  $19.4  million \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\f9 \n\nequivalent  of  the  local  currency  cost.  The  Government  (including  the  oblast  governments)  will \nfinance  about  $11.0  million  (30.6%).  The  financing  plan  is  summarized  in  Table  2  and  details \nare  in  Appendix  6.  Supplementary  Appendix  I  illustrates  the  flow  of  funds.  The  Borrower  will \nenter  into  a  subsidiary  loan  agreement  with  UCSA,  the  EA,  under  ADB  loan  terms  with  an \nadditional charge not exceeding 0.2 percentage point on the ADB interest rate. UCSA will enter \ninto  subloan  agreements  with  oblast  governments  under  the  same  terms.  The  oblast \ngovernments  will  bear  the  foreign  exchange  and  interest  risks  to  be  defined  in  the  subsidiary \nloan  agreement;  the  loan  repayment  will  be  fixed  in  dollars  and  repaid  at  the  prevailing \nexchange rate of the Central Bank of Uzbekistan.  \n \n\n \n\nTable 2: Financing Plan \n($ million) \nForeign \nExchange \n5.6 \n \n0.0 \n \n0.0 \n0.0 \n5.6 \n \n\nLocal \nCurrency \n19.4 \n \n10.1 \n \n0.9 \n11.0 \n30.4 \n \n\n \n\nTotal Cost \n\nPercent \n\n25.0 \n \n10.1 \n \n0.9 \n11.0 \n36.0 \n\n \n\n69.4 \n \n28.0 \n \n2.6 \n30.6 \n100.0 \n \n\nFund Source \n\ngovernments and communities \n\nA.

The  UCSA  will  be  the  EA  and  will  have  overall  responsibility  for  project  coordination, \nimplementation,  and  liaison  with  ADB  and  other  government  ministries  and  departments.  It  is \ndirectly responsible for the planning, design, and development and rehabilitation of water supply \nsystems  under  the  Project.  UCSA  is  headed  by  a  director  general  who  is  assisted  by  two \ndeputies and 65 professional management and technical staff. Currently, UCSA is an EA for the \nADB-supported  Urban  Water  Supply  Project.5  To  optimize  logistical  and  economic  efficiency, \nthe  existing PMU  for  the  Urban  Water  Supply  Project  with  the  additional  staff,  will  be  used  as \nthe PMU for the Project. The PMU will manage and coordinate the work of the two PIUs, which \nwill be in charge of the practical implementation of the two project oblasts. Policy coordination \nand  guidance  for  the  Project  will  be  done  by  an  interministerial  project  steering  committee \n(PSC). The PSC will be chaired by the Cabinet of Ministers and comprise representatives from \nUCSA,  the  Ministry  of  Finance,  Ministry  of  Economy,  Ministry  of  Agriculture  and  Water \nResources,  MOH,  Ministry  of  Public  Education,  State  Committee  for  Nature  Protection,  State \nSanitary and Epidemiological Inspection, State Committee for Geology and Mineral Resources, \nState Committee for Architecture and Construction, State Inspectorate for Supervision of Safety \nImplementation  of  the  Works  in  Industry,  Mining  and  Communal  Sectors,  Kashkadarya  and \nNavoi  oblast  governments,  and  other  agencies  concerned.  The  PSC  will  review  reports  to  be \nprovided  by  the  PMU,  and  provide  guidance  and  instructions,  as  necessary,  to  the  PMU  and \nPIUs.  \n \n32.  The  PMU  will coordinate  implementation  of  the Project,  including  procurement  of  goods, \nworks,  and  services;  and  the  awarding  of  contracts,  in  coordination  with  the  PIUs  at  the  two \n                                                 \n5   ADB.  2001.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors  on  a  Proposed  Loan  to  the \n\nRepublic of Uzbekistan for the Urban Water Supply Project. Manila. \n\n \n\n\fproject oblast centers. The PMU will have staff to be recruited under consulting services in the \nfields  of  project  implementation,  engineering,  financial  management,  procurement,  community \nparticipation,  and  capacity  building.  The  PIUs  will  coordinate  and  manage  all  activities  for \nproject implementation and will report directly to the PMU. The PIUs will coordinate preparation \nand development of the basic WSS infrastructure under the general direction of the PMU. Under \nthe guidance of the PMU, the PIUs will be responsible for all aspects of project implementation \nand  coordinate  closely  with  the  technical  departments  concerned  and  agencies  at  the  oblast \nlevel.  The  PIUs  will  initiate  and  coordinate  key  project  implementation  activities,  including \ncommunity consultations, subproject review, preparation of detailed designs, tender documents, \nconstruction  supervision,  monitoring  and  quality  control,  maintenance  of  project  accounts,  and \nclearance  for  environmental  examinations.  Each  PIU  will  be  supported  by  teams  of  design \ninstitutes  recruited  for  the  preparation  of  design  and  tender  documents  and  construction \nsupervision. Each PIU will have staff members for project implementation to be recruited under \nconsulting  services  in  the  fields  of  engineering,  construction  supervision,  accounting,  and \ncommunity  development.  The  Government  will  ensure  adequate  technical  staff;  the  skills  and \nnumber of each specialist type will be agreed in consultation with ADB, as needed by the PIUs, \nto  help  with  development  and/or  rehabilitation  of  piped  water  supply  systems,  sanitation \nfacilities, and wastewater drainage facilities.  \n \n33.  A  participatory  community-based  approach  has  been  adopted  for  project  design  and \nimplementation. A comprehensive socioeconomic survey was carried out during the initial phase \nof  project  preparation  to  determine  people\u2019s  needs  and  attitude  towards  participation  in  the \nProject in the subproject areas. The survey respondents expressed a strong commitment to pay \nfees  for  improved  water  services  and  provide  financial  contribution  for  improvement  of  private \ntoilet  facilities.  NGOs  in  the  subprojects  areas  also  attended  workshops  during  project \nformulation.  To  achieve  a  high  degree  of  community  involvement  in  the  subproject  design, \nimplementation, and O&M, the PIUs will carry out community participation activities to determine \nthe prospective beneficiaries\u2019 needs, affordability, and WTP for the services. A particular focus \nof  the  participatory  programs  will  be  on  meeting  and  prioritizing  the  needs  of  the  poor. \nAccordingly,  in  preparing  the  subprojects,  once  approved  for  funding,  the  PIUs  will  work  with \nNGOs  to  help  mobilize  the  community  and  prepare  socioeconomic  surveys  of  the  community. \nProject  implementation  and  management  arrangements  are  described  in  Supplementary \nAppendix J. \n \n\n \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Period \n\n \n34.  The Project will be implemented over a period of 5 years, from January 2006 to the end of \n2010. The implementation schedule is in Appendix 7. \n \n\n3. \n\nProcurement \n\n \n35.  The  procurement  of  goods  and  services  under  the  ADB  loan  will  be  undertaken  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Procurement.  International  competitive  bidding  (ICB) \nprocedures will be applied to supply contracts estimated to cost the equivalent of $1 million or \nmore.  Supply  contracts  with  a  value  less  than  $1  million  equivalent  will  follow  international \nshopping  (IS)  procedures,  except  for  supply  contracts  with  a  value  less  than  $100,000 \nequivalent, which may be procured by direct purchase. In principle, ICB will be applied for civil \nworks packages costing more than $2 million. Local competitive bidding (LCB) may be used for \ncivil  works  packages  over  $2 million  where  the  EA's  justifications  are  acceptable  to  ADB. \nCurrently, each civil works contract is estimated at less than $3 million equivalent. Simple minor \ncivil works may be difficult to undertake by contractors at reasonable cost. Such works may be \n\n10 \n\n \n\n\f11 \n\nundertaken  by  the  Borrower  using  its  own  staff  (force  account),  provided  the  works  cost  less \nthan $100,000 equivalent. In addition, force account can be employed only if the Borrower has \nadequate  construction  facilities,  including  equipment,  and  the  capacity  to  undertake  works \nexpeditiously  and  at  reasonable  cost.  A  list  of  indicative  contract  packaging  and  applicable \nprocurement procedures is in Appendix 8. \n \n\n4. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n \n36.  The  Project  will  require  consulting  services  in  the  fields  of  project  management,  WSS \nengineering,  environmental  examination,  hydrogeology,  well  drilling,  HSE,  financing  and \naccounting,  social  assessment  and  safeguards,  and  institutional  development  and  support  for \nthe  following:  (i)  development  of  standard  water  supply  designs,  (ii)  elaboration  of  detailed \ndesign and construction drawings, (iii) preparation of contract packages and tender documents, \n(iv)  construction  supervision  and  evaluation  of  project  activities,  (v)  support  to  the  institutional \ndevelopment  program,  (vi)  support  to  the  activities  of  the  PMU  and  PIUs,  (vii)  training  of \naccounting  staff  in  preparing  loan  withdrawal  applications  and  supporting  documents,  and \n(viii) maintaining  accurate  and  sufficient  accounting  project  records.  A  total  of  680  person-\nmonths  (50  person-months  international  and  630  person-months  domestic)  of  consulting \nservices  are  required  for  project  management  support.  The  international  consultants  will  carry \nout  project  management,  financial,  and  institutional  strengthening  activities.  The  domestic \nconsultants\u2019  main  activities  will  be  to  review  technical  studies,  including  detailed  designs,  and \nsupervise construction. The consultants will be recruited through a firm. The level of consulting \nservices has been discussed and agreed by ADB and the Government. The consultants will be \nengaged by UCSA in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants using quality \nand  cost  based  selection  (QCBS),  and  other  arrangements  acceptable  to  ADB  for  the \nengagement of domestic consultants. The required areas of expertise and terms of reference for \nconsulting  services  are  outlined  in  Appendix  9.  The  detailed  terms  of  reference  for  consulting \nservices are in Supplementary Appendix K. \n \n\n5. \n\nAnticorruption Policy \n\n \n37.  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998)  was  explained  to  and  discussed  with  UCSA. \nConsistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance,  accountability  and  transparency,  ADB \nreserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, \ncollusive  or  coercive  practices  relating  to  the  Project.  To  support  these  efforts,  relevant \nprovisions  of  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  are  included  in  the  loan  regulations  and  the  bidding \ndocuments  for  the  Project.  In  particular,  all  contracts  financed  by  ADB  in  connection  with  the \nProject will include provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and examine the records and \naccounts of the Executing Agency and all contractors, suppliers, consultants and other service \nproviders as they relate to the Project. \n \n\n6. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n \n38.  An  imprest  account  will  be  established  at  a  bank  to  be  agreed  by  the  Government  and \nADB  to  facilitate  the  timely  release  of  loan  funds.  The  Ministry  of  Finance  will  supervise  the \nimprest  account  operations.  The  initial  amount  to  be  deposited  will  be  6  months\u2019  estimated \nexpenditures  or  a  ceiling  not  exceeding  10%  of  the  total  loan  amount.  ADB\u2019s  statement  of \nexpenditure  (SOE)  procedure  will  be  used  to  reimburse  eligible  expenditures  and  to  liquidate \nadvances provided to the imprest account. The individual payments that may be reimbursed or \nliquidated  under  the  SOE  procedure  will  not  exceed  $50,000  equivalent.  The  imprest  account \nand  SOE  procedure  will  be  established  and  maintained  in  accordance  with  The  Loan \n\n \n\n\fDisbursement  Handbook,  dated  January  2001  and  detailed  arrangements  between  the \nGovernment and ADB. \n \n\n7. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n \n39.  The Government through the PMU will (i) maintain separate accounts for the Project, and \n(ii)  have  such  accounts  and  related  financial  statements  audited  annually  by  independent \nauditors  acceptable  to  ADB  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of  the  Loan  Agreement  and  as \nspecified  in  ADB\u2019s  Financial  Reporting  and  Auditing  of  Projects  Financed  by  the  Bank.  The \nauditors should have qualifications, experience, and terms of reference acceptable to ADB. The \nimprest account and SOE records will also be audited as part of the annual audit. A separate \naudit opinion on the use of the imprest account and SOE will be submitted. The Government will \nsubmit to ADB certified copies (in English) of such audited accounts and financial statements, \nand the related reports of auditors, within 6 months after the close of each financial year. For the \npurpose  of  complying  with  the  requirements  for  annual  audited  financial  statements,  the \nproceeds  of  this  loan  may  be  used  to  finance  expenditure  for  private  sector  auditors  and \ntranslations of auditors\u2019 reports into English. UCSA will submit consolidated quarterly progress \nreports to ADB (in English) on all aspects of project implementation, including resettlement. The \nreports will include details on overall implementation progress, problems encountered during the \nreporting period, measures taken or proposed to be taken to remedy these problems, and the \nproposed program of activities for the following quarter. Within 3 months of project completion, \nUCSA  will  prepare  and  submit  to  ADB,  in  a  format  acceptable  to  ADB,  a  project  completion \nreport on the utilization and impact of the loan; performance of the Project; economic and social \nbenefits generated; and details about implementation, costs, resettlement, and other information \nrequested by ADB. \n \n\n8. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n \n40.  The  PMU  will  implement  a  project  performance  monitoring  system  (PPMS)  for  each \nsubproject to evaluate the delivery of the planned facilities and the subproject benefits accrued. \nA  framework  and  indicative  indicators  have  been  prepared  and  a  PPMS  outline  is  in \nSupplementary  Appendix  L.  The  PMU,  with  the  assistance  of  the  consultants,  will  develop \ncomprehensive  PPMS  procedures  and  plans  within  6  months  after  loan  effectiveness.  The \nPPMS  activities,  including  the  establishment  of  benchmarks,  collection  of  information, \nmonitoring of benefits, and evaluation of social impact, will be undertaken by local governments. \nData  collection  will  be  carried  out  prior  to  physical  implementation  of  each  subproject,  in \nconjunction  with  socioeconomic  surveys.  It  will  then  continue  on  a  regular  basis  during \nimplementation and for 3 months after physical completion. The results will be incorporated into \nthe project progress and completion reports. \n \n\n9. \n\nProject Review \n\n \n41.  The Project will require close monitoring and review in particular to ensure decentralized \ninstitution  building  and  sustainable  O&M.  The  Project  will  be  reviewed  twice  a  year.  A \ncomprehensive review of the implementation arrangements, including the role of the UCSA and \nDWCUs as well as project start-up experience, will be undertaken by the Government and ADB \n1  year  after  loan  effectiveness.  A  comprehensive  midterm  review  will  be  undertaken  3  years \nafter  loan  effectiveness,  and  will  focus  on  the  impact  on  poverty  reduction,  implementation \narrangements,  resettlement,  community  involvement,  physical  implementation,  design  and \ntechnology,  O&M  and  cost  recovery  arrangements,  institutional  aspects  (including  training), \n\n12 \n\n \n\n\f13 \n\nhealth  education,  and  the  role  of  women.  The  reviews  will  also  assess  the  Project\u2019s  progress \nand achievements against its objectives, identify any problems, and discuss possible solutions.  \n \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\nlocal \n\nEnvironmental Impacts and Benefits \n\n \nA. \n \n42.  Overall, the Project is environmentally beneficial. Initial environmental examinations (IEEs) \nwere  carried  out  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Environmental  Policy  (2002),  Environmental \nAssessment  Guidelines  (2003),  and  national  guidelines.6  A  summary  initial  environmental \nexamination (SIEE) is in Appendix 10. The physical subprojects component\u2014involving simple, \nappropriate,  low-cost  technology\u2014does  not  pose  any  significant  adverse  environmental \nconsequences. The provision of safe drinking water and proper sanitation facilities is expected \nto  have  a  significant  positive  impact  on  improvement  of  the  environment.  Water  resources, \nparticularly groundwater, are scarce throughout the country. The use of centralized water supply \nfrom  centralized  water  resources  systems  is  usually  the  most  cost-effective  and  economic \nfeed \nsolution.  When  available, \ndecentralized waters supply systems, provided the water quality meets the required standards \nand the annual replenishment allows sustainable development. The quality of water resources \nselected for development has been reviewed and fit the norms. The Government\u2019s environment \nsector  policies  and  the  capacity  of  the  Government  agencies  involved  are  adequate.  The  IEE \nreports  and  the  SIEE  have  concluded  that  none  of  the  subprojects  are  environmentally \nsensitive.  Environmental  concerns,  for  which  appropriate  safeguards  will  be  built  into  the \nsubproject  designs,  include:  (i)  protection  of  environmentally  sensitive  areas  around  water \nsources, (ii) provision for proper collection and disposal of wastewater, (iii) controlled long-term \nextraction  from  groundwater  sources,  (iv)  safeguarding  the  interests  of  downstream  users  of \nsurface  sources,  (v)  protection  measures  for  historical  monuments  and  natural  sites  of \necological importance, and (vi) avoiding encroachment on household perimeters and cultivated \nlands.  The  core  subprojects\u2019  IEEs  are  in  Supplementary  Appendix  M  and  the  environmental \nassessment and review framework (EARF) is in Supplementary Appendix N. \n \nB. \n \n\nfresh  groundwater  resources  are  developed \n\nSocial Safeguards \n\nto \n\n1. \n\nPoverty Reduction and Social Benefits \n\n \n43.  A  poverty  and  social  analysis  was  undertaken  for  the  Project  as  a  whole\u2014covering  the \n12 subprojects\u2014to  assess  the  demand,  need,  capacity,  WTP  and  affordability,  gender, \ncommunity  participation,  and  other  risks.  Although  it  is  a  sector  project,  no  poverty  and  social \nassessment is required for additional subprojects. The Project will benefit about 250,000 people, \nof which more than 30% are considered poor, in the two project oblasts. \n \n44.  The Project is expected to: (i) improve the quantity and quality of water available, which \nwill  lead  to  an  improved  quality  of  life;  and  (ii)  empower  vulnerable  and  disenfranchised \ncommunities  through  formation  of  DWCUs.  Access  to  potable  water  and  increased  sanitation \nawareness among the rural population and children will improve health and sanitation. Improved \nhealth  conditions  will  reduce  the  mortality  rate  and  incidence  of  waterborne  diseases.  The \nProject\u2019s  HSE  program  stresses  the  need  to  adopt  proper  sanitary  practices.  This  will  lead  to \nenvironmental  improvements,  added  health  benefits,  and  increased  productivity\u2014resulting  in \ndirect economic benefits. To ensure equitable access to safe and reliable water supply for poor \n\n                                                 \n6   RCM 118.0027714.24-93 \u201cInstruction on the procedure for environmental impact assessment\u201d. \n\n \n\n\frural  communities,  monitoring  systems  will  be  developed  at  the  community  and  project \nadministration  levels.  The  UCSA  will  monitor  the  socioeconomic  implications  of  the  Project \nthrough all the implementation phases as part of the PPMS. A summary of the poverty reduction \nand social development strategy is in Appendix 11. \n \n\n2. \n\nInvoluntary Resettlement \n\n \n45.  Specific land requirements have not been fully identified. An initial involuntary resettlement \nscreening  shows  that  the  Project  may  require  a  total  of  85\u201390  hectares  (ha)  of  land  for  the \nlocation of small groundwater pumping stations and, in some cases, small storage tanks. These \nwill  be  outside  village  areas  in  unused  land  and  will  not  require  the  displacement  of  people. \nPipelines are planned to be constructed along existing roads. Alternative design options will be \ncompared  at  the  design  stage  to  minimize  temporary  or  permanent  encroachment  on \nagricultural  land.  All  land  in  Uzbekistan  is  state-owned  but  there  are  both  collective  and \nindividual  land  use  rights.  Use  of  land  is  regulated  by  the  state  through  oblast  and  local \nadministrations.  \n \n46.  Lands needed for the construction of new facilities will be contributed by the state and will \nremain state property. The Government will screen each subproject before the award of the civil \nworks contracts to determine whether there are any involuntary resettlement effects that would \nrequire compensation and other assistance under ADB's Policy on Involuntary Resettlement. To \nensure that ADB policies on involuntary resettlement will be applied and impacted families will \nbe  compensated,  a  resettlement  framework  (RF)  has  been  prepared  which  sets  out  the: \n(i) resettlement  policy,  (ii)  compensation  standards  and  entitlements,  and  (iii)  procedural \nguidelines  to  be  complied  with  for  subprojects  where  people  are  adversely  affected  by  land \nacquisition or project construction. The RF was prepared and endorsed by UCSA, and copies \nhave been disclosed to the subproject areas. The RF has been uploaded to the ADB website. \nSubsequently, each subproject with resettlement impacts will be required to prepare and submit \na resettlement plan (RP) to ADB for approval, prior to commencement of land acquisition and \ncivil works. Resettlement implementation will be monitored by UCSA and an independent body. \nThe  summary  RF  is  in  Appendix  12,  RPs  for  the  core  subprojects  are  in  Supplementary \nAppendix O, and the detailed RF is in Supplementary Appendix P. \n \n\n3. \n\nEthnic Minorities \n\n \n47.  The poverty and social assessment has shown that there are no ethnic minority issues in \nthe four core subprojects. Ethnic minorities (i.e., Tajiks, Kazakhs, and Karakalpaks) are present \nin  the  additional  subproject  areas  of  Kitab,  Shakhrisabz,  Kanimeh,  and  Novbahor  districts.  An \nethnic  minorities  development  framework  (EMDF)  was  developed  to  guide  the  preparation  of \nnon-core subprojects, which have positive and adverse impacts on ethnic minorities. The EMDF \nfor additional subprojects is in Supplementary Appendix Q. Ethnic minorities will be represented \nin  the  DWCUs  and  will  benefit  equally  from  the  Project.  Monitoring  of  the  Project\u2019s  impact  on \nethnic minorities has been incorporated in the PPMS. Specific measures to address the needs \nof ethnic minorities have been incorporated in the selection of the subprojects. \n \n\n4. \n\nGender Issues \n\n \n48.  Provision of adequate-quality potable water will have a direct positive impact on women, \nand will reduce women\u2019s labor inputs and promote more effective time budgeting. Through the \nProject, poor women-headed households will have equal access to potable water. Children will \nhave  more  time  for  schoolwork  and  welfare  activities.  Specific  steps  to  enhance  women\u2019s \n\n14 \n\n \n\n\f15 \n\nparticipation in the Project include: (i) identifying women\u2019s groups in the community; (ii) training \nwomen\u2019s community groups to participate in project-related activities such as health education \nand  gender  issues;  (iii)  training  women\u2019s  organizations,  including  those  representing  poor \nwomen, in the decision-making process (including planning of WSS facilities); and (iv) providing \nemployment opportunities for women in local government and DWCU activities. A gender action \nplan is in Supplementary Appendix R.  \n \nC. \n \n\nInstitutional Benefits  \n\n1. \n\nProject Benefits and Impacts \n\n \n49.  The  Project  will  benefit  about  250,000  people,  of  which  more  than  30%  are  considered \npoor, in the two project oblasts through provision of improved access to safe and reliable water \nsupply and better sanitation facilities. Technical, economic, and financial analyses confirm that \nthe  least-cost,  long-term  solutions  involve  development  and/or  rehabilitation  of  water  sources \nand  water  supply  systems.  This  approach  will  bring  social  and  economic  benefits,  including \npoverty  reduction,  financial  sustainability  at  affordable  levels  for  project  beneficiaries,  and \npositive environmental impacts. Institutional solutions and community participation in the design \nand implementation of the subprojects will enhance the efficiency and sustainability of the sector \nprogram and subprojects.  \n \n\n2. \n\nInstitutional Strengthening \n\n \n50.  The UCSA is currently implementing another ADB-assisted water supply project, and has \nadequate  capacity  and  experience  to  implement  the  Project.  However,  there  is  a  need  for \ninstitutional  strengthening  at  local  government  levels,  especially:  (i)  planning  and  financial \nmanagement systems; and (ii) community participation structures and processes, and capability \nto  handle  resettlement  issues,  including  the  design  and  implementation  of  resettlement  plans. \nInstitutional  strengthening  is  directly  incorporated  in  the  Project  through  the  institutional \ndevelopment component, including a capacity-building program,  HSE program, and consulting \nservices for project management support. \n \nD. \n \n\nEconomic and Financial Aspects \n\n1. \n\nEconomic Aspects \n\n \n51.  The economic analysis covers both the Project as a whole, and the individual subprojects \n(Appendix  13).  For  the  Project  as  a  whole,  the  analysis  covers  the  economic  rationale  for \ngovernment  intervention,  and  the  goals  and  general  design  of  the  investment  plan.  The \neconomic rationale is sound, based on social responsibility to provide basic social services and \ncontrolling  natural  monopoly  (water  supply).  The  goals  of  the  investment  plan  are  to  meet \ntargets  for  rural  water  supply  development  and  control  of  the  spread  of  waterborne  disease, \nespecially  in  hard-to-reach  areas.  The  targets  are  clearly  defined,  legally  established,  and \nconsistent with government goals for sustainable development in rural water supply, as defined \nin  the  National  Water  Supply  Development  Program  (NWSDP),  2000\u20132010.  The  plan  to  meet \ntargets is based on centralized water supply systems designed using least-cost solutions based \non  type  and  availability  of  water  resources  and  variations  in  scope,  design  technologies, \nlocation,  and  planning  horizon.  Other  project  goals  consistent  with  NWSDP  include  cost \nrecovery  and  sustainability  tariffs,  conservation  and  economic  use  of  water,  and  improved \ndecentralization.  Economic  cost-benefit  analysis  for  the  individual  subprojects  was  also \n\n \n\n\fundertaken to strengthen the economic justification. The economic internal rate of return for the \nfour representative subprojects range between 23% and 36%. \n \n\n2. \n\nFinancial Aspects \n\n \n52.  Financial  evaluation  of  the  four  representative  core  subprojects  was  undertaken  in  real \nterms using constant April 2005 prices. The project cost estimates and financial projections in \nnominal  terms  after  tax  were  converted  to  real  terms  by  adjusting  for  foreign  and  domestic \ninflation and currency fluctuation. The financial internal rate of return (FIRR) for each subproject \nis  more  than  the  weighted  average  cost  of  capital,  computed  on  an  after-tax  basis.  The \nsubprojects are considered both financially viable and sustainable. The FIRRs for the four core \nsubprojects range between 6.6% and 7.9%, averaging 7.2%. This compares favorably with the \nweighted average cost of capital of 4.5%. Sensitivity and risk analyses indicate that the FIRR is \nrobust  under  adverse  conditions.  Projected  tariffs  are  within  the  accepted  limit,  so  they  are \naffordable to low-income group households. \n \n53.  Financial projections were prepared for each of the subproject entities in accordance with \nADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  the  Financial  Governance  and  Management  of  Investment  Projects \nFinanced  by  ADB  (2002)  and  ADB\u2019s  Framework  for  the  Economic  and  Financial  Appraisal  of \nUrban Development Sector Projects (1994) to assess the financial viability and sustainability of \neach  subproject  (Appendix  14).  Projected  financial  statements  indicate  that  financial  revenues \nwill be sufficient to cover O&M costs from the first year of operation and a substantial portion of \ndepreciation  from  years  1\u20134.  By  year  5,  the  subprojects  will  have  achieved  financial  self-\nsufficiency  to  attain  full  cost  recovery  during  the  remaining  repayment  period.  Details  of  the \nfinancial analysis for the four core subprojects are presented in Supplementary Appendix S. \n \n\n3. \n\nAffordability Analysis and Project Sustainability \n\n \n54.  The water supply subprojects will be community driven from the initial stage of formulation \nand  construction,  and  DWCUs  will  participate  in  O&M  of  the  schemes  as  self-supporting \nagencies to the extent possible. Based on the survey undertaken, the rural population appears \nwilling to increase water services payments. Expressed as a percentage of average household \nincome  of  the  low-income  group,  the  tariffs  are  expected  to  vary  between  2.3%  and  5.7%  for \nlow-income households in Kashkadarya (4.0% average), and between 1.9% and 7.5% in Navoi \n(4.7%  average).  These  values  are  within  the  accepted  standards  from  3%  to  5%.  Since  it  is \nlikely  that  poorer  households  will  collect  water  from  public  standpipes  at  a  fixed  monthly  rate, \nthe  cost  will  be  much  less  than  for  households  with  in-house  connections.  The  subproject \nrevenues are expected to cover O&M costs and depreciation to ensure project sustainability.  \n \nE. \n \n55.  Three  possible  risks  have  been  identified.  First,  the  possibility  of  delays  in  project \nimplementation  caused  by  weak  institutional  capability  to  implement,  operate,  and  maintain \nwater supply systems has been addressed through clear delineation of agency responsibilities \nand inclusion of coordination mechanisms. Considerable preparatory work has been undertaken \nin  the  potential  subproject  communities  regarding  the  present  status  of  water  supply  facilities, \nand an initial assessment of required development has been carried out. Substantial support will \nalso  be  provided  for  capacity  building  through  training  programs  and  consulting  services. \nSecond,  the  potential  for  delays  in  project  implementation  caused  by  lack  of  local  counterpart \nfunds has been addressed by the active participation of local administrations, which meet some \nconstruction  supervision  and  all  land  requirements.  Measures  to  reduce  possible  delays  have \n\nProject Risks \n\n16 \n\n \n\n\f17 \n\nbeen discussed with the Government. Third, limited financial capability to meet the incremental \nO&M  of  the  expanded  water  supply  systems  has  been  dealt  with  by  including  the  institutional \ndevelopment  program,  which  should  strengthen  the  capacity  to  undertake  the  O&M  of  the \nexpanded water supply systems. The Project will be closely monitored, with two reviews a year \nthroughout implementation. \n \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\n \nA. \n \n56. \nfollowing assurances, which will be incorporated in the Loan and Project Agreements: \n \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  and  UCSA  have  given  the \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nThe  Government,  with  the  assistance  of  the  oblast  governments,  will  cause  the \ncreation of DWCUs to serve villages participating in the Project. The DWCUs will \n(a) ensure that each community benefiting from the Project becomes involved in \nthe O&M of the Project facilities, and (b) assist in the collection of water bills. \n\nThe Government will cause the oblast governments to conduct annual reviews of \nthe  level  and  structure  of  water  tariffs  in  order  to  ensure  that  these  tariffs  are \neconomically  justified  and  cover  all  the  O&M  costs,  taking  into  account  water \nconsumption  volumes  and  repair  costs.  The  results  of  such  reviews  will  be \nsubmitted to ADB through UCSA within 3 months after their completion. \n\nThe  Government  will  cause  the  oblast  governments,  supported  by  the  DWCUs \nconcerned,  to  (a)  take  appropriate  measures  for  the  proper  collection  of \noutstanding  water  bills,  and  (b)  protect  their  water  resources  and  facilities \nthrough  vigorous  prosecution  for  violations  such  as  water  meter  tampering  and \nwater theft. \n\nThe Government, through UCSA and the oblast governments, will ensure that (a) \nrelevant  NGOs  and  community-based  organizations  are  involved  in  subproject \nplanning, design, construction, and O&M, as well as in actively helping with the \ncapacity  building,  health,  and  hygiene  components  of  the  Project;  (b)  women\u2019s \ncommunity  groups  participate  in  all  relevant  Project-related  decision-making \nactivities;  and  (c)  adequate  opportunities  for  the  employment  of  women  in \nDWCU-related activities under the Project are made available.  \n\nThe  Government,  through  UCSA,  will  ensure  that  the  screening,  selection  and \nappraisal of subprojects are based on the criteria outlined in the schedule to the \nProject  Agreement.  The  Government  will  cause  UCSA  to  obtain  the  prior \napproval of ADB for any subproject. \n\nThe  Government,  through  UCSA,  will  ensure  that  with  regard  to  all  non-core \nsubprojects (a) initial IEEs are prepared; (b) each IEE meets the requirements of \nthe  Government\u2019s  environmental  assessment  and  review  process,  ADB\u2019s \nEnvironment  Policy  (2002),  the  EARF  prepared  for  the  Project,  and  the  model \nIEEs  developed  for  the  core  subprojects;  (c)  each  IEE  indicates  that  the \nsubprojects  will  not  result  in  significant  long  term  negative  environmental \nimpacts;  and  (d)  each \nincludes  a  costed  subproject  environmental \nmanagement plan (EMP) and defined mitigation measures in line with local laws \nand ADB\u2019s Environment Policy that will be implemented to mitigate environment \n\nIEE \n\n \n\n\f18 \n\n(vii) \n\nimpacts  during  construction  and  operation.    The  progress  of  the  EMPs  will  be \nreported to ADB as part of project monitoring and review. \n\nThe  Government  will  cause  UCSA  to  implement  the  Project  in  accordance  with \nthe Project\u2019s RF dated August 2005 and the four RPs prepared for the four core \nsubprojects,  and  the  eight  RPs  to  be  prepared  for  the  remaining  eight \nsubprojects.  UCSA,  through  the  subloan  agreements  with  oblast  governments, \nwill  ensure  that  (a)  all  land  and  rights-of-way  required  for  the  Project  are  made \navailable  by  the  oblast  governments  in  a  timely  manner,  in  accordance  with  all \napplicable laws and regulations of the Borrower, and ADB\u2019s Policy on Involuntary \nResettlement  (1995);  and  (b)  counterpart  funds  for  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement activities are provided in a timely manner, with UCSA meeting any \nobligations in excess of budgeted estimates. UCSA will also ensure that (a) each \nindividual RP is submitted to ADB for approval prior to any land being acquired or \npeople  being  affected  under  the  relevant  RP;  (b) adequate  staff  and  resources \nare committed to supervising and monitoring the implementation of the RPs and \nproviding  quarterly  reports  on  such  implementation  to  ADB;  (c)  an  independent \nagency  acceptable  to  ADB  is  engaged  by  UCSA  to  monitor  and  evaluate \nresettlement,  and  to  submit  reports  to  ADB  semi-annually;  and  (d)  civil  works \ncontractor specifications include requirements to comply with the RPs. \n\n(viii)  The  Government  will  cause  UCSA  to  (a)  update  the  RPs  prepared  for  the  four \ncore  subprojects,  disclose  them  through  the  oblast  governments  to  all  affected \npersons, and resubmit them to ADB for concurrence; and (b) ensure that the RPs \nprepared  for  the  eight  non-core  subprojects  are  based  on  the  RF  and  final \ndesign, and are submitted to ADB for approval.   \n\n(ix) \n\n(x) \n\n(xi) \n\nIn the event of any significant material change in Project scope, UCSA will advise \nADB  of  such  change  and  submit  an  updated  RF  to  ADB  for  its  approval.  With \nrespect to any updated RPs, UCSA will cause the relevant oblast government to \ndisclose such updated RPs to affected persons prior to ADB approval. \n\nThe Government will cause UCSA to ensure that (a) the EMDF prepared for the \nProject  and  ethnic  minorities  development  plans  (EMDPs)  are  implemented  in \naccordance  with  their  terms;  and  (b)  EMDPs  are  prepared  for  relevant \nsubprojects  if  ethnic  minority  impacts  are  considered  significant  in  accordance \nwith the EMDF and ADB\u2019s Policy on Indigenous Peoples (1998). \n\nIf  EMDPs  are  required,  the  Government  will  cause  UCSA,  through  the  subloan \nagreements  with  the  oblast  governments,  to  ensure  that  (a)  the  EMDPs  are \ndisclosed to affected persons; (b) ethnic minorities in Project areas are consulted \nand  provided  with  an  opportunity  to  participate  in  the  implementation  of  the \nEMDPs; (c) sufficient budget for implementation and monitoring of each EMDP is \nmade available in a timely manner, and any obligations in excess of the EMDP \nbudget  estimates  are  met;  (d)  any  significant  changes  to  the  EMDPs  are \nsubmitted to ADB for approval; (e) an independent agency acceptable to ADB is \nengaged  by  UCSA  to  carry  out  regular  monitoring  and  evaluation  of  the \nimplementation of the EMDPs and to report annually to ADB; and (f) the targeted \nethnic  minorities  will  benefit  from  the  Project  and  will  be  at  least  as  well  off  as \nthey would have been in the absence of the Project. \n\n(xii) \n\nTo  address  gender  impacts  and  promote  women\u2019s  active  involvement  in  the \nProject,  the  Government  will  cause  UCSA,  through  the  PMU,  to  be  responsible \nfor implementing and monitoring the gender action plan prepared for the Project. \n\n \n\n\f19 \n\nIn particular, UCSA will ensure women are involved in training, the HSE program, \nand the membership of the DWCUs. \n\n(xiii)  The  Government,  through  UCSA,  will  ensure  that  the  implementation  of  the \nProject,  the  operation  of  the  Project  facilities,  and  the  benefits  derived  from  the \nProject  are  monitored  and  evaluated  on  an  annual  basis  by  the  PMU.  Within  6 \nmonths  of  the  loan  becoming  effective,  the  Government  will  cause  the  project \nperformance  monitoring  system  (PPMS)  to  be  refined  by  UCSA  in  a  manner \nsatisfactory to ADB so as to include the use of all relevant financial and technical \nmonitoring indicators and information. \n\n(xiv)  One year after the loan becomes effective, the Government will conduct a review \nof  the  implementation  arrangements,  including  the  role  of  UCSA  and  the \nDWCUs, as well as Project start-up experience, and will invite ADB to participate \nin  the  review.  The  Government  will  conduct  similar  comprehensive  reviews \nduring the second and fourth years of Project implementation, and will invite ADB \nto participate in these reviews as well. \n\n \nCondition for Loan Effectiveness \n\nB \n \n57.  The Government will enter into a subsidiary loan agreement with UCSA under terms and \nconditions satisfactory to ADB. \n\n \n\nVI. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n \nI am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \n58. \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and,  acting  in  the  absence  of  the  President,  under  the \nprovisions  of  Article  35.1  of  the  Articles  of  Agreement  of  ADB,  I  recommend  that  the  Board \napprove the loan in various currencies equivalent to Special Drawing Rights 17,291,000 to the \nRepublic  of  Uzbekistan  for  the  Kashkadarya  and  Navoi  Rural  Water  Supply  and  Sanitation \nSector Project, from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources with an interest charge at the rate of 1% \nper  annum  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5%  per  annum  thereafter;  a  term  of  32  years, \nincluding a grace period of 8 years; and such other terms and conditions as are substantially in \naccordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  draft  Loan  and  Project  Agreements  presented  to  the \nBoard. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \nJoseph Eichenberger  \nVice President  \n\n \n\n \n \n16 November 2005\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f20 \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n \n\nDesign \nSummary \n\nImpact \n \nImproved living standards \nand public health in rural \nareas of Kashkadarya and \nNavoi oblasts (provinces)  \n \n\nOutcome \n \nImproved access to basic \nwater supply and \nsanitation facilities in the \nproject areas \n \n\nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n\nPerformance \nTargets/Indicators \n\n \n \nBy 2010, in the project \narea: \n \n\u2022  Increase public \n\nsatisfaction with water \nsupply quality from \ncurrent 40% (100,000 \npeople) to 80% \n(200,000 people). \n\n \n\u2022  Reduce incidence of \nwaterborne diseases \nfrom current 30% \n(75,000 people) to 10% \n(25,000 people). \n\n \n\u2022  Reduce medical costs \n\nfor treatment of \nwaterborne disease \nfrom current average  \n$10 per year, by 40% to \n$6 per person per year. \n\n \n\u2022  Reduce loss of working \ndays due to waterborne \ndiseases from current \naverage 20 days, by \n50% to 10 days per \nperson per year.  \n\n \n \n\u2022  Number of rural \n\nsettlements with water \nsupply systems \ncommissioned \n(54 villages in 2008, \n108 in 2009, and \n170 in 2010) \n\n \n\u2022  At least one school with \nupgraded water supply \nand sanitation in each \nvillage \n(54 villages in 2008, \n108 in 2009, and \n170 in 2010) \n\n \n \n\nData \nSources/Reporting \nMechanisms \n\n \n \n\u2022  Water quality in service \nsystems monitored and \nreported by the MOH \n\n \n\u2022  Annual socioeconomic \n\nAssumptions \nand Risks \n\nAssumptions \n \n\u2022  Improved quality of water \n\nsupply is sustained by rural \nwater supply agencies \n\n \n\u2022  Kashkadarya and Navoi \n\nsurveys undertaken as part \nof a performance \nmanagement system \n\noblast administrations remain \ncommitted to implement the \nProject \n\n \n\u2022  Annual public health \nstatistics of MOH \n\n \n \n\n \n\u2022  HSE program effectively \n\nimplemented on a constant \nand sustainable basis \n\n \nRisks  \n \n\u2022  Lack of government and local \ncommunity commitment to the \nProject \n\n \n\u2022  Institutional development \n\nprogram and public \nparticipation not implemented \n\n \n\n \n \n\u2022  Operational and financial \n\nreports of UCSA  \n\n \n\u2022  Report of external auditors \n\nand regulators \n\n \n\u2022  Management information \n\nsystem of the oblast water \nsupply agencies \n\n \n\u2022  Public health reports of \n\nMOH \n\n \n\u2022  Water quality in service \nsystems monitored and \nreported by MOH  \n\n \n\u2022  Socioeconomic surveys \n \n\u2022  ADB review missions \n \n\nAssumptions \n \n\u2022  Adequate government \n\ncofinancing of water supply \ninfrastructure upgrade \n\n \n\u2022  Adequate and timely \n\nfeasibility study \n\n \nRisks \n \n\u2022  Budget restrictions affecting \n\nimplementation of the \ninstitutional program \n\n \n\u2022  Adjustments in tariffs are not \n\naccepted by customers \n\n \n\u2022  Tariff policy changes are \n\nhalted \n\n \n\u2022  Unsubstantiated inflation of \n\nwater tariffs \n\n \n\u2022  Lack of community \n\nparticipation  \n\n\f      \n\n   Appendix 1       21     \n\n \n\nDesign \nSummary \n\nPerformance \nTargets/Indicators \n\nData \nSources/Reporting \nMechanisms \n\n \n \n\u2022  Financial and operational \n\nreports of UCSA \n\nAssumptions \nand Risks \n\nAssumptions \n \n\u2022  Water sources prove reliable \n\nand cost-effective \n\n \n\u2022  Management information \n\n \n\u2022  Water quality standards are \n\nOutputs \n \n1.

The  Government \nprefers  an  integrated  rural  development  policy,  which  targets  the  overall  sustainability  of  rural \nsettlements and sets the following main objectives: (i) improvement of environmental conditions, \n(ii)  improvement  of  rural  incomes,  (iii)  provision  of  adequate  housing,  (iv)  availability  of  social \nand health services, and (v) coverage of people\u2019s needs in drinking water and sanitation.  \n \n3. \nUzbekistan  is  a  signatory  to  Agenda  21.  As  such,  it  has  adopted  the  principle  of \n\u201crationalization  of  utilization  of  land,  water  and  other  natural  resources  to  conserve  their \nreserves  for  forthcoming  generations\u201d  as  one  of  its  major  goals  for  sustainable  development. \nFurther,  recognizing  the  significant  disparities  in  the  levels  of  development  between  urban \ncenters  and  rural  villages,  the  Government\u2019s  support  for  the  transition  to  sustainable \ndevelopment  prioritizes:  (i)  the  needs  of  rural  settlements,  (ii)  redressing  regional  disparities, \nand  (iii)  addressing  the  needs  of  the  poorer  segment  of  the  population  based  on  the  overall \nprinciple  that  sustainable  development  of  rural  settlements  determines  the  sustainability  of \ncountrywide development.  \n \n4. \nThe  Policy  emphasizes  the  adoption  of  cost-effective  construction  technologies  and \nimprovement  of  management  procedures  oriented  towards  economic  use  of  water  and \nreduction of water wastage through: (i) installation of water meters; (ii) elimination of leakages, \nillegal  connections,  and  other  water  losses;  (iii)  further  reduction  of  specific  rates  of  water \ndemand; and (iv) improvement of water tariff collection performance.  \n \n5. \nThe  Government  has  prepared  and  started  a  number  of  national  programs  targeted  at \ncontributing  to  sustainable  overall  development  of  rural  settlements,  funded  by  the  national \nbudget, as well as loans and grants from external sources. In the rural sanitation subsector, the \nfocus  of  government  efforts  has  been  on  upgrading  basic  sanitation  services  and  fostering \nschool sanitation and hygiene through a series of integrated projects. Nine interregional water \nsupply systems are targeted for completion by 2010. These constitute the least-cost solution for \nthe supply of large areas, in comparison with the main alternative, which is desalination. \n \n6. \nRecognizing the urgency of these tasks, the Republic of Uzbekistan has taken steps to \ndevelop a comprehensive policy covering its water supply and sanitation (WSS) sector. The key \nobjectives of the Policy are to: (i) improve water sector services through a national water supply \ndevelopment  plan;  (ii)  attain  financial  sustainability  through  an  effective  tariff  system  and  cost \nrecovery; (iii) plan adequate investments with domestic and external funding; (iv) achieve further \ndecentralization  of  WSS  services;  (v)  encourage  private  sector  participation  and  public-private \npartnerships in the sector; (vi) implement hygiene and sanitation education programs in schools; \n(vii) achieve improved livelihood conditions, particularly for the benefit of women in rural areas; \n(viii)  ensure  environmental  compliance  by  encouraging  conservative  development  of  water \nresources, economic use of water, consistent water quality control, and sound management of \n\n\f24 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nwastewater;  and  (ix)  improve  further  operational  strategies  by  strengthening  the  sector \ninstitutional setup and interagency collaboration, and by promoting adequate capacity building. \n\nInstitutional Framework \n\n \n7. \nUnder the Policy, the Government has committed to a 10-year program (2000\u20132010) to \nimprove  water  supply  to  rural  communities,  many  of  which  currently  have  inadequate  or  no \nwater supply. This program, developed in 1999 and modified in 2003, envisions the construction \nof water supply systems and improvement of the service level of drinking water supply with the \naim of benefiting up to 85% of Uzbekistan\u2019s rural population. Although the program has had a \nslow start, it is making good progress and necessary institutional arrangements have been set \nin place (as of September 2005).  \n \nB. \n \nCentral  level.  The  Uzbekistan  Communal  Services  Agency  (UCSA),1  under  the \n8. \nsupervision of the Cabinet of Ministers, has the overall task of improving national water supply \nservices and the main goal of setting up financially viable local water supply services. UCSA\u2019s \nscope covers tasks ranging from regulatory to commercial, including: (i) provision of regulatory \nadvice  to  support  reforms  in  the  communal  services  sector;  (ii)  monitoring  compliance  with \nsector policies by local authorities and commercial entities; and (iii) attracting foreign investment \nto the sector, including the establishment of joint ventures. \n \n9. \nProvincial  level.  Uzbekistan\u2019s  11  oblast  vodokanals  act  as  UCSA\u2019s  executive  arm  for \nwater supply and sewerage within the oblasts. Each oblast vodokanal coordinates the activities \nof  urban  and  rayon  vodokanals.  Some  specific  tasks  of  the  oblast  vodokanals  are  to: \n(i) determine  annually  the  limits  of  water  production  for  the  various  service  areas  under  the \ncompetence of urban and rayon vodokanals, (ii) calculate tariffs for all categories, and (iii) keep \nstatistical information received from rayon vodokanals.  \n \nRayon level. The rayon vodokanals are subordinate to the oblast vodokanals and have \n10. \nresponsibility for water distribution primarily to rayon centers and, in some cases, to neighboring \nvillages. \n \n11.  Water  resources  management  in  Uzbekistan  falls  under  the  following  main  agencies: \n(i) Ministry of Agriculture and Water Resources, responsible for all surface water use; (ii) State \nCommittee  on  Geology  and  Mineral  Resources,  responsible  for  groundwater  investigation, \nmanagement, monitoring, and protection; and (iii) State Inspectorate for Regulating the Use of \nWater in Industry and Mining, responsible for thermal and mineral water. In addition, the State \nCommittee  for  Nature  Protection  monitors  liquid  effluents  and  exerts  control  of  pollution  of \nnatural water resources. \n \nC. \n \n12. \nThe  Government  initiated  institutional  changes  as  early  as  1991,  adopting  a  gradualist \napproach  in  implementing  reforms,  thus  avoiding  abrupt  changes  while  maintaining  strong \ncentralized  control  and  leadership.  Significant  early  changes  adopted  by  the  Government \nincluded: (i) prioritizing improvement of infrastructure services in communal and rural areas, and \n\nLegal Basis of the Policy \n\n                                                 \n1   See  (i)  Resolution  of  the  Cabinet  of  Ministers  (RCM)  No.  429  of  2  November  2000  on  the  Establishment  of  a \nSpecial  Commission  on  Reorganizing  the  System  of  Communal  Services;  (ii)  Presidential  Decree  No.  2791  of \n19 December 2000 on Further Reforms in the Management System of Communal Services; and (iii) RCM No. 493 \nof 21 December 2000, on Improving the Organization of the Communal Services System. \n\n\f \n\n   Appendix 2  25 \n\n(ii)  abolishing  agencies  too  rigidly  associated  with  a  command  economy.  Laws  promulgated \nsince 1991 have facilitated the transition to a market economy2 and encouraged foreign direct \ninvestment.3 \n \nThe Policy is based on the following legal documents: (i) Law on Water and Water Use, \n13. \n1993,4 which establishes the principles of allocation of water resources, the right to withdrawal \nof groundwater resources, and provides for protection and conservation of water; (ii) Resolution \nof the Cabinet of Ministers (RCM) No. 385 of 3 August 1993 on Transitional Rules for Limitation \nof  Water  Use,  which  addressed  the  problem  of  increasing  water  shortages  by,  among  other \nthings, rendering compulsory the issuing of permits for extraction of more than 100 cubic meters \n(m3)  of  water  per  day;  (iii)  RCM  No.  461  of  3  November  1998  on  Approval  of  the  Concept  of \nStrengthening  Economic  Reforms  in  the  Communal  Services  Sector;  (iv)  RCM  No.  405,5  which \n(a) includes instructions for providing all rural settlements with drinking water from 2003 to 2010, \nand  developing  additional  water  resources,  and  (b)  encourages  support  for  private  initiatives \nand the participation of local organizations and communities in the construction of water supply \nsystems.  \n \n14. \nThe Updated Water Supply Development Scheme for the Republic of Uzbekistan based \non the New Regulatory Principles and Norms up to the Year 2010 was finalized in 1999.6 The \nscheme  provides  for  the  implementation  of  a  national  drinking  water  supply  program  in  both \nurban  and  rural  areas  using  the  time  horizon  of  2010.  It  includes:  (i)  reviews  of  the  existing \nwater  supply  situation,  (ii)  assessments  of  unaccounted  for  water  and  wastage,  (iii)  review  of \ndesign  criteria  and  proposals  for  reduction  of  unit  water  consumption  and  control  of  water \nwastage,  (iv)  population  and  water  demand  projections,  (v)  comparison  of  demand  and \nresources,  (vi)  analysis  of  transmission  mains,  (vii)  main  directions  for  implementation  of  the \nwater  supply  scheme,  (viii)  recommendations  for  innovative  technologies,  (ix)  estimate  of  the \nfinancial needs of the scheme, and (x) review of the existing legal framework. \n \nA major step towards reform in the water supply sector was the reorganization in 2000 of \n15. \nthe  communal  services  system,  which  led  to  the  dismantling  of  the  Ministry  of  Communal \nServices and the transfer of responsibility for water supply to the oblast administrations, Council \nof  Ministers  of  the  Republic  of  Karakalpakhstan,  Tashkent  city  administration,  and  the  newly \ncreated UCSA. \n\n \n \n \n\n                                                 \n2    Law  on  Denationalization  and  Privatization,  November  1991,  amended  7  May  1994  and  23  September  1994; \nPresidential Decree of January 1994 to Promote Economic Reform Process; and Presidential Decree of 15 March \n1994  on  Priority  Directions  of  Further  Development  of  Denationalization  and  Privatization  in  the  Republic  of \nUzbekistan. \n\n3    Law  on  Foreign  Investments,  1994;  Law  No.  609-I  of  30  April  1998  on  Foreign  Investments;  Law  No.  611-I  of \n30 April 1998, on Guarantee and Measures for Protection of Foreign Investors Rights; Presidential Decree No. 477 \nof 18 November 1998 on Measures to Encourage the Attraction of Foreign Capital in the Course of Privatization of \nState Property. \n\n4   Law No. 837-XII of 6 May 1993 on Water and Water Use.  \n5   RCM  No.  405  of  17  September  2003  on  Additional  Measures  for  the  Improvement  of  the  Supply  of  Rural \n\nSettlements with Drinking Water and Natural Gas. \n\n6   The Uzbekkommunalloiha Design Institute was the principal author of the scheme. \n\n\f26 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n \n\nSUMMARY OF SECTOR INVESTMENT PLAN \n\nMedium- to Long-Term Development Strategy \n\n \nA. \n \nThe  main  goals  of  Uzbekistan\u2019s  medium-  to  long-term  economic  policy  are  to  ensure \n1. \nsteady, long-term growth as the basis of improving living standards. Core objectives targeted by \nthe  Government\u2019s  development  strategy  for  the  medium-term  development  plan  until  2010 \ninclude:  (i)  undertaking  social  measures  aimed  at  reducing  the  poverty  level,  (ii)  creating  new \njob opportunities, and (iii) increasing household income.  \n \n2. \nA  number  of  major  programs  have  been  completed  or  are  currently  under \nimplementation,  including  the  state  housing  support  program,  health  reform  program,  national \npersonnel training program, water supply and sanitation program, natural gas supply program, \nstate  family  protection  program,  and  other  programs.  In  the  public  utilities  sector,  the \nGovernment  has  recognized  the  most  acute  social  problem  as  the  lack  of  adequate  supply  of \nsafe water, particularly in rural areas. This situation is exacerbated by the ecological problems \nof the Aral Sea, and the pollution and depletion of surface and groundwater resources.  \n \n3. \nSince  1991,  the  Government  has  pursued  expansion  of  Uzbekistan\u2019s  piped  water \nsupply.  In  implementing  its  water  supply  program,  the  Government  has  placed  particular \nemphasis on the development of long distance, interregional transmission mains, carrying water \nfrom its source to urban and rural settlements where no fresh water is available.  \n \n4. \nThe  Government  establishes  3-year  Public  Investment  Programs  (PIPs)  aimed  at \nimplementing its strategies and objectives. In developing each PIP, all ministries are involved in \nthe  programming  process  and  determination  of  priorities.  A  PIP  is  refined  on  an  annual  basis \nwith an investment program and promulgated as a Resolution of the Cabinet of Ministers (RCM) \nas an annual investment program. The investment program for 2005 was adopted by RCM No. \n560 of 30 November 2004. \n \nB. \n \nthe  National  Water  Supply  Development  Program  (NWSDP)  2000\u201310 \n5. \n(the Program), the Government envisages: (i) construction of water supply systems and raising \nthe level of drinking water supply to benefit 85% of the rural population by 2010, increasing to \n100%  by  2020;  and  (ii)  provision  of  remote  and  hard-to-reach  areas  with  alternative  water \nsupply sources. The NWSDP also gives particular emphasis to the adoption of new construction \ntechnologies,  demand  management  directed  towards  economic  use  of  water  and  wastage \nreduction, and enhancement of private participation and decentralization initiatives. \n \nThe NWSDS proposes staged development of Uzbekistan\u2019s water supply infrastructure \n6. \nby  2010.  Based  on  the  Program  and  recognizing  the  urgency  to  achieve  of  the  goals,  the \nGovernment has set up and started a number of projects targeted at contributing to the overall \nsustainable  development  of  rural  settlements,  using  the  national  budget  and  loans  and  grants \nfrom external sources.  \n \n \n \n7. \nThe  NWSDS  estimates  the  total  financial  needs  for  reconstruction  of  the  urban  water \nsupply sector at $896 million until 2005, and an additional $1,527 million from 2006 to 2010. For \nrehabilitation  of  the  rural  water  supply  sector,  the  needs  were  estimated  at  $930  million  (until \n\nWater Supply Development Program  \n\nCost Estimates of the Program \n\nThrough \n\n1. \n\n\f  Appendix 3 \n\n27 \n\n2. \n\nImplementation of the Plan \n\n2005)  and  $1,706  million  (2006\u20132010),  totaling  $2,636  million.  The  total  financial  needs  for \nreconstruction of the water supply sector alone were established at $5,058 million. \n \n \n \n8. \nThe NWSDP is being is implemented following three main streams: (i) interregional and \nlong-distance  transmission  mains  and  related  production  facilities;  (ii)  the  rural  water  supply \npriority program, according to RCM No. 405; and (iii) annual sector investment programs. The \nimplementation of the rural component had a slow start, but substantial accomplishments were \nachieved  with  the  construction  of  interregional  transmission  mains.  About  $345  million \n($93 million from domestic sources and about $252 million from foreign funding) was engaged \nfor the implementation of rural and urban water supply projects, including remote and hard-to-\nreach areas of the country. \n \n9. \nTo  provide  more  focus  on  rural  areas,  particularly  the  most  remote  rural  settlements \nwhich are most likely to suffer from lack of continuous and safe water supply, the Government \nreviewed the NWSDP in 2003, defined a list of 3,500 villages needing priority water supply, and \ninstructed  oblasts  (regional  administrations)  to:  (i)  establish  lists  of  priority  rural  settlements  to \nbe supplied with drinking water during 2003\u20132010, and (ii) develop additional water resources.  \n \nSince  2003,  the  Government  has  boosted  the  implementation  of  water  supply  projects \n10. \nwith the participation of external finance. By the end of 2005, 650,000 inhabitants of rural and \nurban centers in Karakalpakhstan and Khorezm are expected to be served with improved water \nsupply  and  sanitation  services.  The  committed  target  for  2010  includes  850  villages  in \nKashkadarya,  Navoi,  Ferghana,  and  Andijan  oblasts.  Of  about  3,500  villages  needing  water \nsupply, about 1,100 will receive a new or renovated water supply by 2010 and the remainder is \ntargeted for 2020. \n  \nC. \n \n11. \nConcerning  the  long-term  investment  plan  beyond  2010,  the  2005  investment  program \nprovides  financial  estimates  for  investments  required  for  no  less  than  12  water  supply  and \nsanitation projects totaling $363.3 million. The investment needed to provide water supply to the \nremaining rural settlements, particularly in remote and hard-to-reach areas, from 2010 to 2020 \n(in addition to the committed investments) is estimated at about $700 million. \n\nInvestments for the Medium to Long Term \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f28 \n\nAppendix 4 \n\n \n\nSUMMARY OF ASSESSMENT OF THE CAPACITY OF THE EXECUTING AGENCY \n\nProject Management Overview \n\n \nA. \n \nThe  Uzbekistan  Communal  Services  Agency  (UCSA),  as  the  Executing  Agency  (EA), \n1. \nhas  the  required  capability  to  lead  the  Project.  A  project  management  unit  (PMU)  has  been \nestablished  at  central  level  within  UCSA.  Project  implementation  units  at  oblast  level  will \nrepresent  the  PMU  in  all  technical,  administrative,  and  financial  issues  during  implementation. \nUCSA  and  the  PMU  will  use  design  institutes  and  nongovernment  organizations  to  provide \nfeasibility  studies,  subproject  safeguard  compliance  monitoring,  construction  supervision,  and \nimplementation of the institutional and capacity building program. UCSA will secure independent \nreview  of  financial  auditing,  and  auditing  for  implementation  of  the  resettlement  plans,  gender \naction plan, and environmental compliance. \n \n2. \nIn  terms  of  long-term  project  management,  when  completed,  each  new  water  supply \nsystem will fall under the jurisdiction of the oblast administration through the oblast vodokanal. \nThe  oblast  vodokanals  will:  (i)  monitor  the  long-term  subproject  technical  and  financial \nperformance, (ii) ensure that water billing and bill collection will be sufficient to meet the planned \ngoals  of  recovery  of  O&M  and  depreciation,  and  (iii)  provide  advisory  and  management \nassistance  to  the  new  rural  water  supply  systems.  At  subproject  level  a  Drinking  Water \nConsumers  Union  (DWCU)  will:  (i)  require  all  households  and  other  water  consumers  to \ncontribute  in  a  participatory  manner,  and  commit  to  pay  for  water;  and  (ii)  constitute \nmanagement boards which will be responsible for day-to-day management and be accountable \nto  the  oblast  vodokanal.  For  systems  supplied  from  individual  sources,  clusters  of  villages \nserved  from  one  single  pumping  station  or  groundwater  production  unit  will  join  to  constitute \nextended DWCUs. \n \nB. \n \n3. \nUCSA  has  gained  experience  in  externally  funded  projects.  It  is  currently  successfully \nconducting  the  Bukhara  and  Samarkand  Water  Supply  and  Sanitation  Project  funded  by  IDA-\nIBRD,1 and is the EA of the Urban Water Supply Project funded by the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB).2 Since its creation in 2000, UCSA has constructed or renovated 7,579 kilometers (km) of \nwater  supply  transmission  and  distribution  networks.  There  is  currently  (2005)  a  well-defined \nprogram  to  rehabilitate  1,670  km  of  additional  transmission  mains  in  various  regions  of  the \ncountry. UCSA has firm financial commitments enabling the construction of water supply for at \nleast 800 rural villages by 2010 and more commitments are in the pipeline. \n \n4. \nThe  assessment  rates  UCSA  and  its  financial  management,  reporting,  and  monitoring \nsystems  as  satisfactory.  UCSA  and  the  project  units  are  adequately  staffed  with  efficient  and \nexperienced  personnel.  Project  staff  is  trained  in  ADB  procedural  requirements  and  National \nAccounting  Standards.  Financial  management  systems  in  place  at  UCSA  and  applied  in  its \nproject operations provide a reasonable and sufficient basis for determining the state of finances \nat agency and project levels. Financial statements and other reports satisfy standards. Special \naccounts and fund flow procedures are established for each project to facilitate monitoring and \ncontrol. UCSA has satisfactory financial management capability to: (i) record required financial \ntransactions and balances, (ii) provide regular and reliable financial statements and monitoring \n\nInstitutional Financial and Managerial Capability \n\n                                                 \n1  World Bank. 2002.

The PMU accountants \nhave been trained in ADB financial management procedures. \nUCSA\u2019s accounting policy is based on UNAS. A manual for the accounting \nprocedures is available to PMU staff and UCSA AAD. The PMU financial \nmanagement manual is updated annually and satisfies the requirements of the \nMOF and ADB. \nTo date, UCSA has established an internal audit unit for the gas supply division.  \n\nUCSA and the PMU are audited by independent external auditors on an annual \nbasis. The audit is in accordance with International Accounting Standards and \ncomplies with the requirements of ADB and MOF. \n\nUCSA and PMU reports comply with the reporting requirements of the MOF, \nMOE, and the State Tax Committee. PMU progress and financial reports conform \nto ADB requirements and are regularly submitted to ADB. \nUCSA and the PMU use accounting software for internal and project operations, \nand financial reporting, but the systems are not linked in a joint network. Linking \nUCSA, PMU, and PIUs in one information network may improve the effectiveness \nof information exchange.  \n\nStrengthening of Institutions through Capacity Building \n\nAAD = Accounting and Auditing Department, ADB = Asian Development Bank, MOE = Ministry of Economy, MOF = \nMinistry  of  Finance,  PIU  =  project  implementation  unit,  PMU  =  project  management  unit,  UCSA  =  Uzbekistan \nCommunal Services Agency, UNAS = United Nations Accounting Standards. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \nC. \n \n5. \nThe  Project  aims  to  construct  water  supply  and  improve  sanitation  facilities  in  rural \nsettlements which have little or no knowledge in the operation and maintenance (O&M) of local \npublic utilities. Further training is needed, although farmers are familiar with the use and repair \nof agricultural machinery and irrigation infrastructure and have sufficient technical capability to \ncarry out O&M tasks for rural water supply systems. At oblast level, institutional strengthening \nand  capacity  building  is  being  undertaken  to  prepare  personnel  for  future  tasks.  At  UCSA, \nextension of the coverage activities to the rural water supply and sanitation subsector requires \nadditional  personnel  and  provision  of  adequate  training.  Further  strengthening  of  capacity  has \nbeen identified in the following areas: (i) overall project management, (ii) financial practices, and \n(iii) project loan disbursement procedures in accordance with ADB guidelines.

In addition, the Project will rehabilitate about 170 toilet facilities in schools. \n \nB. \n \n\nExisting Environment  \n\n1. \n\nPhysical Environment \n\n \n2. \nThe Kashkadarya River originated in western Tajikistan, enters the Kashkadarya oblast \nat  the  northeastern  boundaries  of  the  oblast,  and  ends  its  course  in  a  desert  area  in  the \nnorthwestern  part  of  the  oblast.  The  Zarafshan  River,  also  originating  in  Tajikistan,  flows \nwesterly,  across  the  southern  part  of  the  Navoi  oblast.  The  Aydarkul  salty  lake,  occupying  a \nnatural  depression  in  the  northern  part  of  the  Nurota  rayon,  is  the  largest  water  body  entirely \nwithin the territory of Uzbekistan. In a large part of the two project oblast territories, especially \nNavoi oblast, groundwater is salinized with total dissolved solids content often exceeding 5 g/l. \nHowever, there are aquifers with variable amounts of freshwater reserves in some of the project \nrayons in Kashkadarya and Navoi oblasts. The most important groundwater resources are in the \nalluvial  deposits  of  the  Kashkadarya  river  and  its  tributaries,  in  the  territory  of  the  Kitab  and \nShahrizabs  rayons,  in  the  northeast  of  Kashkadarya  oblast.  The  quality  of  the  groundwater  is \ngenerally good. \n \n\n2. \n\nSocioeconomic Environment \n\n \n3. \nThe average household size in rural areas is 6.7 in Kashkadarya and 6.2 in Navoi, with \n2.1  (Kashkadarya)  and  2.5  (Navoi)  persons  in  each  household  in  permanent  or  temporary \nemployment  (including  children  under  15  years  old).  The  employment  rate  of  employable-age \npopulation  is  about  70%  in  Kashkadarya  and  73%  in  Navoi  oblasts,  which  is  quite  high \ncompared with the national average. Only 31% of rural households in Kashkadarya  and 32% in \nNavoi have access to piped drinking water, mostly through a street standpipe. However, water \nis distributed for an average of 1 to 3 hours a day in most villages with piped water service, and \nthe service is often interrupted for several consecutive days. In some settlements, piped water is \navailable  only  once  a  week.  Better-off  households  buy  relatively  expensive  water  from  water \nvendors. A large part of the rural population living in project areas uses alternative, unsafe water \n(including rainwater) from rivers and irrigation canals. Consequently, at least one person in 10% \nof rural householders in Kashkadarya in 16% in Navoi oblast contracted waterborne diseases in \n2004. Parasitic and communicable gastrointestinal diseases are the most frequent, followed by \nnon-communicable  gastrointestinal  disease,  kidney  disease,  and  skin  disease.  About  14%  of \nrural households in Kashkadarya and 35% in Navoi oblast have a room designated for bathing \nin their housing, but water is transported to these rooms by buckets. Non-ventilated pit latrines \nin domestic gardens are used to dispose of human waste. Most of these toilets in the surveyed \nhouseholds are not equipped with leak-proof concrete lining. In general, schools in the project \nvillages do not have water supply or have a non-functioning supply, and are equipped with non-\nventilated pit latrines comprising 4 to 12 holes.  \n \n\n\f      \n\n Appendix 10         39    \n\n \n\n3. \n\nBiological Environment \n\n \n4. \nThere  are  41  protected  species  living  in  mountain  and  protected  areas  in  Uzbekistan. \nSome  of  the  protected  species  in  Uzbekistan  have  their  habitat  in  the  two  project  oblasts. \nHowever, their habitats are found in remote areas, in the mountain ranges of the northern part \nof Kashkadarya oblast, or in the Kyzyl Khum desert in the north of Navoi oblast, far away from \nthe project areas. In all subproject areas, irrigated agriculture is intensely developed and does \nnot  offer  ideal  refuge  to  wild  animals.  There  are  no  reported  protected  wild  habitats  or \nendangered animal species in the project areas. Typical livestock grazing in the pasture lands \nare Persian lambs, goats, cattle, and horses. Flora is common and scarcely developed.  \n \n\n4. \n\nCultural Environment and Historical Heritage \n\n \n5. \nThe Kashkadarya and Navoi oblast study areas are between the oblasts of Samarkand \nin the east and Bukhara in the east. Imprints of the cultural heritage which has marked the two \nhistorical  cities,  Bukhara  and  Samarkand,  are  found  in  some  places  within  the  project  rayons, \nbut always away from project sites. \n \nC. \n \n\nPotential Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n\n1. \n\nEnvironmental Impacts Caused by the Project Location \n\n \n6. \nThe  territory  of  all  project  areas  includes  generally  agricultural  or  nonclassified  land. \nPermanent infrastructure will require the permanent restriction from any use of about 45 ha of \nmainly  agricultural  land.  The  location  of  infrastructure  to  be  constructed  can  be  designed  with \nflexibility, taking care to the extent possible to locate permanent, on-ground infrastructures (such \nas  pumping  stations,  production  wells,  and  elevated  tanks)  in  areas  that  would  not  cause \nsignificant  environmental  implications.  Losses  resulting  from  temporary  and  permanent  use  of \nland will be compensated in the frame of a resettlement plan. Raw sources of water (including \nsurface  and  groundwater),  which  will  be  selected  as  the  sources  for  water  supply  in  each \nsubproject, will have to be tested before the final decision for development. The results of the \nquality  tests  must  prove  that  the  water  is  suitable  for  drinking.  Before  undertaking  long-term \nexploitation  of  groundwater,  accurate  assessment  of  the  annual  average  replenishment  of \ngroundwater  reservoir  will  be  conducted.  The  long-term  design  yield  of  each  production  well \nadded  up  to  the  yield  of  other  wells  already  in  use  will  not  exceed  the  aquifer\u2019s  sustainable \nannual recharge.  \n \n\n2. \n\nImpacts Related to Design \n\n \n7. \nAlternative  design  options  can  be  developed  to  optimize  the  location  of  the  production \nwell  sites,  pumping  stations,  and  elevated  pressure  reservoirs  which  will  require  permanent \noccupation of land. Pipeline construction will cause temporary occupation of land along rights of \nway. Measures are taken to design and construct transmission mains and distribution networks \nin  areas  implying  no  or  minor  environmental  concerns.  Transmission  mains  will  be  designed \nalong  existing  roads,  to  the  extent  possible.  Measures  are  also  being  taken  to  avoid  any \nencroachment  on  natural  protected  sites  of  historical  and  archaeological  importance,  if  any, \nduring construction works.  \n \n\n\f40 \n\nAppendix 10 \n\n3. \n\nImpacts during Construction and Mitigation Measures \n\n \n8. \nOccupation of Agricultural Land. Measures will be taken at the design stage to avoid \nencroachment on irrigated and other agricultural lands, private buildings, and houses. In some \ncircumstances,  pipelines  will  have  to  be  constructed  in  cultivated  land.  The  resettlement \nframework  addresses the need for compensation for temporary crop loss and permanent land \noccupation. \n \nIncreased  Traffic  and  Use  of  Machineries.  In  subprojects  supplied  by  decentralized \n9. \ngroundwater  sources  developed  near  villages,  there  will  not  be  significant  disruption  of  traffic \nalong  main  communication  roads.  In  subprojects  with  centralized  resources,  requiring \nconstruction of transmission mains along main and secondary roads, safety measures will have \nto be enforced by contractors in accordance with the national code for traffic safety. Temporary \nor permanent traffic lights will be installed by contractors in most sensible road crossings, under \nthe supervision of the project implementation unit (PIU). Traffic police control will be intensified \nin  villages  during  construction  and  adequate  warning  will  be  provided  to  enhance  vigilance \namong schoolchildren. \n \n10. \nAir  Pollution.  Temporary  environmental  concerns  related  to  the  use  of  excavators, \ncranes, compressors, and other machinery during construction works will include: (i) noise and \ndust from construction sites, and (ii) safety for workers and inhabitants. Measures will include: \n(i) avoiding  work  with  noisy  equipment  in  settled  areas  at  night;  (ii)  careful  conduction  of \nexcavation, earthmoving works, and transportation of earth, particularly within settled areas; and \n(iii) use of masks by operators. \n \n11.  Water  Resources.  Some  main  natural  watercourses  cross  subproject  areas,  and  in \nsome cases, irrigation canals. Protection zones are normally established along the main natural \nwatercourses. All necessary measures shall be taken to respect the restriction rules within the \nmeasures. Some local groundwater aquifers constitute significant alternative resources for local \nwater  supplies  in  certain  subproject  areas.  Adequate  waste  management  measures  will  be \nimplemented to prevent accidental pollution of water resources. \n \nSoils.  Soils  could  be  exposed  to  contamination  by  the  same  sources  of  pollution  as \n12. \nwater resources (para. 11). Soil protection measures are to be enforced in accordance with the \nRU  norms  \u041a\u041c\u041a  3.01.01-97  and  \u041a\u041c\u041a  3.05.03-97.  During  pipeline  construction,  organic  topsoil \nsuitable  for  further  utilization  will  be  removed  and  temporarily  stored  apart  from  the  remaining \nremoved earth. The organic soil will be placed on top of the backfilling material, compacted, and \nrestored to agricultural use. \n \n13.  Waste Management. Measures at the construction sites will include provision of refuse \ncollection  containers  for  solid  waste  and  used  oil  collection  containers,  with  further  removal  to \nspecially allocated disposal and reclamation sites. After completion of construction works, all job \nsites will be cleaned and landscaped. Sanitation facilities will be constructed at the work sites. \n \nHistorical and Cultural Sites and Landscape. The subproject areas are located away \n14. \nfrom historical monuments. Before starting works, an inventory of all historical monuments and \ncultural heritage sites will be established with local rayon authorities and oblast departments of \nthe  State  Committee  for  Nature  Protection.  Any  discovery  of  archaeological  remnants  during \nexcavation works will be reported immediately to the rayon authorities.  \n \n\n\f      \n\n Appendix 10         41    \n\n \n\n4. \n\nLong-Term Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n\n \n15.  Wastewater. Operation of the water supply systems will not imply any risk of pollution of \nwater  resources  in  the  long  term.  The  Project  targets  full  coverage  of  water  supply  service \nthrough  individual  connections.  Increased  amounts  of  water  used  for  domestic  needs  will  be \nrecycled  for  watering  domestic  gardens.  Excess  wastewater  which  cannot  be  recycled  in \ngardens,  especially  during  winter,  will  be  drained  out  of  the  village  areas.  This  water  is  not \ntypical sewage, as all toilets are pit latrines. Measures will include the improvement of ditches \nand street drainage to evacuate the non-recycled used domestic water in natural sedimentation \nponds outside the villages.  \n \n16. \nProtection  of  Water  Resources  and  Water  Quality.  Protection  perimeters  will  be \ndetermined  and  fenced  around  the  production  wells  fields  and  boosting  pumping  stations,  in \naccordance  with  the  requirements  of  the  norm  \u041a\u041c\u041a  2.04.02-97  \u201cWater  Supply  Networks\u201d.  A \nsanitary protection belt is also established along the route of water transmission mains crossing \nbuilt-up areas, based on the norm \u041a\u041c\u041a 2.04.02-97. \n \n17. \nImpacts  Caused  by  the  Project  Infrastructure  Operation.  Water  disinfection  will  be \nimplemented using chlorine. Chlorination facilities will be placed in a separate chlorination unit \nwithin the pumping stations. Preventive measures will have to be enforced to ensure the safety \nof personnel involved in the operation of infrastructure facilities.  \n \n18. \nProject  Demobilization.  There  will  be  no  decommissioning.  The  electromechanical \ncomponents  will  be  replaced  every  20  years  and  dismantled  parts  will  be  partially  recycled. \nSubstituted components of the chlorination units will also be dismantled or disposed of in safe \nrepositories for special waste, in accordance with national regulations. \n \nD. \n \n19. \nAn  environmental  management  and  monitoring  plan  (EMMP)  has  been  prepared.  It \ndistinguishes  between  monitoring  to  be  conducted  during  the  construction  and  monitoring \nundertaken  during  the  operation  of  the  water  supply  infrastructure.  The  parameters  to  be \nmonitored, as well as the frequency of monitoring and reporting, will be tested and adjusted as \nneeded during the Project. \n \nE. \n \n20. \nThe oblast departments of the State Committee for Nature protection will be responsible \nfor:  (i)  environmental  clearance  of  all  physical  infrastructure,  (ii)  monitoring  of  environmental \ncompliance during  construction  works,  and  (iii)  environmental  monitoring  follow-up. The  oblast \nSanitary  and  Epidemiological  Services  of  the  Ministry  of  Health  will  be  in  charge  of  periodic \ntesting  of  physicochemical  and  bacteriological  content  in  drinking  water  in  the  distribution \nsystem  for  compliance  with  national  quality  norms  set  out  in  the  GU  Norm  O\u2019z-DSt  950:2000. \nThe PIU will be responsible for implementation of the EMMP in each subproject. The PIU will be \nstaffed  with  a  community  development  specialist  who  will  be,  among  other,  in  charge  of \nsupervising implementation of the EMMP. The project budget includes provision for training of \nthe PMU and PIU personnel in environmental procedures. To facilitate the monitoring process, \nan  environmental  monitoring  group  will  be  set  up  and  will  be  composed  of  one  representative \nfrom the following: (i) PIU, (ii) rayon administration, (iii) design institute in charge of construction \nsupervision,  (iv)  administrations  of  the  villages  included  in  the  subproject,  and  (v)  main \ncontractor for civil works (for impacts during construction). \n\nInstitutional Arrangements for Environmental Compliance \n\nEnvironmental Management and Monitoring Plan \n\n\f42 \n\nAppendix 10 \n\nConclusions and Recommendations \n\nPublic Consultation and Information Disclosure \n\nF. \n \n21. \nConsultation  has  been  conducted  with  the  representatives  of  local  and  rayon \nadministrations  of  the  four  core  subprojects  in  a  seminar-type  project  presentation  on \n11 May 2005 in Navoi and 12 May 2005 in Kashkadarya. All participants were invited to expose \nsensible  environmental  problems  in  the  project  areas  and  express  their  opinions  and  provide \ninput  on:  (i)  alternative  solutions  aimed  at  minimizing  impacts  with  particular  emphasis  on \ntemporary  and  permanent  land  occupation,  (ii)  information  on  historical  sites  and  protected \nareas within the oblasts, (iii) environmentally related social issues, and (iv) problems related to \nvulnerable people. The discussions and comments provided essential background, particularly \nwith regard to information on the local environment. Subsequently, close focus meetings were \nheld with representative of stakeholders, consisting of Councils of Rural Communities, mahalla \nassociations,  and  rayon  administration  representatives  from  16\u201318  June  2005.  People  mainly \nexpressed  concern  for  issues  related  to  land  occupation.  There  was  general  consensus  that \navailability  of  drinking  water  on  a  continuous  base  would  constitute  a  substantially  positive \nimprovement  for  health  and  sanitation.  The  draft  feasibility  study  reports  of  each  core \nsubproject,  including  relevant  initial  environmental  examinations,  have  been  disseminated  for \nconsultation  at  the  four  rayon  centers  administrative  buildings  and  in  villages  included  in  the \nProject from 15 August 2005 to 15 September 2005. \n \nG. \n \n22. \nThe Project is substantially aimed at improving  the health of 250,000 rural people who \ncurrently  suffer  from  lack  of  water  supply  and  adequate  sanitation  facilities.  The  few  negative \nimpacts  are  of  a  limited  extent,  can  be  prevented  by  implementing  the  EMMP,  and  can \neventually  be  easily  mitigated.  The  development  schemes  adopted  represent  the  least-cost \nsolution as well as the most environmentally compatible alternatives. The Project is a necessary \nstep to enhance chances for economic development and poverty alleviation in the rural areas of \nKashkadarya and Navoi oblasts. Failure to implement the Project would lead to deterioration of \nhealth, increase in poverty, and increase in emigration\u2014particularly young people in search of \nbetter  living  opportunities  in  cities  or  abroad.  There  is  a  well  structured  environmental \ninstitutional framework at central and oblast levels. Procedures for examination of environmental \ncompliance are well in place and tested. The legal basis is exhaustive and substantially covers \nthe various environmental sectors. Threats to human health are practically negligible during the \nconstruction phase and in the long term. It is recommended to implement the proposed EMMP \nand revise it in a timely manner, when appropriate. \n \nH. \n \n23. \nAn environmental assessment review framework is in Supplementary Appendix N, which \nincludes highlights of the possible negative environmental impacts that can occur in the areas of \nthe  eight  supplementary  subprojects  as  well  as  possible  compensation  measures,  based  on \nexamples provided by the core subprojects.  The environmental assessment review framework \nalso  includes  also  a  set  of  environmental  criteria  for  subproject  selection,  guidelines  for  initial \nenvironment  examination  public  consultation  and  disclosure,  and  estimates  of  staffing  and \nbudget requirements. \n \n\nEnvironmental Assessment and Review Framework \n\n\f Appendix 11         43    \n\n \n\n      \n\n \n\n \nA. \n\nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY \n\nLinkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \n\nIs the sector identified as a national \npriority in country poverty analysis?   \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  Yes \n\n    No \n\n \n\nIs the sector identified as a national \npriority in country poverty partnership \nagreement?   \n\n \n Yes \n \n  No \n\n \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in Uzbekistan: \n \nPoverty  remains  pervasive  in  Uzbekistan.  Investments  in  social  infrastructure  such  as  clean  water  are  considered \nimportant inputs for sustainable poverty reduction. Although access to potable water is not a problem for low-income \nhouseholds,  water  shortage\u2014especially  in  rural  areas\u2014equally  affects  low-income  and  well-off  households.  This \nmakes poverty deeper, as it entails significant extra costs to meet basic living needs. Direct losses because of lack of \naccess  to  clean  potable  water  and  sanitary  facilities  include  the  following:  (i)  high  time  and  labor  cost  related  to \ndelivering water and doing household work, especially for women and children; (ii) high costs of coping strategies for \nwater shortage, including the construction of water reservoirs; (iii) high disease incidence; (iv) limited opportunities for \nself-employment development, especially in the service sector. \n \nSome 25% and 33% of families in Kashkadarya and Navoi oblasts pay about $0.4 per month on average for potable \nwater. However, households that buy water from water vendors spend $42 per year on average in Kashkadarya oblast \nand  $23  in  Navoi  oblast.  The  remaining  households  do  not  pay  for  water  in  monetary  terms,  but  expend  enormous \ntime and labor inputs in water delivery, and incur losses related to disease treatment and nonattendance of school by \nchildren due to diseases, etc. The Project will benefit about 250,000 people, more than 30% of whom are considered \npoor, in the two project oblasts, through the provision of improved access to safe and reliable water supply and better \nsanitation  facilities.  Technical,  economic,  and  financial  analyses  confirm  that  least-cost  long-term  solutions  involve \ndevelopment  and/or  rehabilitation  of  water  sources  and  water  supply  systems.  This  approach  will  bring  social  and \neconomic benefits, including poverty reduction, financial sustainability at affordable levels for project beneficiaries, and \npositive environmental impacts. Institutional solutions and community participation in design and implementation of the \nsubprojects will enhance the efficiency and sustainability of the sector program and subprojects.   \n \nAt least one family member in 10% of families in Kashkadarya oblast and 16% in Navoi oblast suffered from disease \nrelated to low water quality and lack of access to sanitary facilities. In Novbahor rayon of Navoi oblast, the figure rises \nto 36%. The most common water-related diseases are diarrhea, dysentery, gastrointestinal and kidney diseases, and \nhepatitis \u0410. Average expenses in 2004 reached $85 in 5% of families that had to spend money on treatment of water-\nrelated  diseases.  The  Project  will  potentially  reduce  the  incidence  of  waterborne  diseases,  medical  cost,  and  the \nnumber of school and work days lost due to sickness. To achieve the full benefit of the Project, parallel improvements \nare  required  in:  (i)  public  health  education,  (ii)  higher  standard  of  personnel  hygiene,  (iii)  disease  prevention  and \ncontrol,  and  (iv)  improved  housing  and  living  conditions.  The  Project  addresses  these  aspects  through  the  hygiene \nand sanitation education (HSE) program.  \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis  \n \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?  \n \nThe  population  of  the  rural  settlements  located  within  the  project  area,  which  comprises  12  administrative  rayons  in \ntwo  oblasts,  is  about  1  million  (about  155,000  families).  According  to  World  Bank  studies  in  2003,  21.4%  of  the \npopulation  of  the  Central  Economic  Region  (which  comprises  Navoi  oblast)  and  47.4%  of  the  population  of  the \nSouthern Economic Region (which comprises Kashkadarya oblast) lived below the poverty line.1 The survey of 2000 \nhouseholds,  undertaken  in  March  2005  using  World  Bank  methodology  and  approved  by  the  Government,  showed \nthat the poverty rate is 38.1% in Kashkadarya oblast and 24.1% in Navoi oblast\u2014equivalent to 330,000 people.  \n\nTargeting Classification: General intervention \n\n                                                 \n1   The World Bank study adopted consumption of 2,100 kcal per capita per day (1,500 kcal) as an extreme poverty \nline. In the 2005, the poverty rate for each oblast was not estimated. In the World Bank\u2019s 2003 study, poverty rates \nwere quoted as 18.7% in Navoi and 62.6% in Kashkadarya oblasts in 2000.  \n\n\f44 \n\nAppendix 11 \n\nThe poverty line is SUM12,300 ($11.3) per capita per month in Kashkadarya oblast and SUM13,700 ($12.5) in Navoi \noblast. Average per capita family income of the poor is 40% lower than non-poor family income in Kashkadarya oblast \nand 16% lower in Navoi oblast. The educational level of poor families is close to the national average. However, the \nshare of heads of households with higher education in poor families is two times lower than in non-poor families. The \nshare of employable-age unemployed is high in poor families (62% in Kashkadarya and 54%in Navoi). More than 80% \nof the unemployed are women. Most of the poor are workers on shirkat farms or self-employed who cultivate their own \nsmall plots (up to 0.1 ha).  \n \nLow  income  and  limited  employment  opportunities  are  major  reasons  for  poverty.  Employment  opportunities  are \nlimited  in  all  sectors  of  the  economy,  including  the  agricultural  sector,  due  to  lack  of  jobs,  low  wages,  irregular  and \nunsure  payment,  and  low  professional  skill  level  of  the  poor.  The  agricultural  sector  is  currently  undergoing \ntransformation  of  shirkat  farms  into  private  farms,  a  process  that  triggers  significant  labor  surplus.  Self-employment \nopportunities are limited due to the shortage of resources, underdeveloped market institutions, legislative limitations, \nand lack of information about ways and opportunities of increasing income in new market-oriented conditions. Family \naccess to land (beside access to private farm plots) does not reduce the poverty risk, as family garden plots are too \nsmall to generate sufficient income. Families that do not have the opportunity of employment in nonagricultural sectors \nmust  become  entrepreneurs,  running  small  enterprises  or  being  self-employed  (largely  unregistered  small-scale \ntrade). Employment in the nonagricultural sector reduces poverty risk by almost half. \n \nAbout 99% of families live in their own houses. Both poor and non-poor families have limited access to public utilities \n(natural gas, electricity, and potable water). Some 86% of families in Kashkadarya oblast and 65% of families in Navoi \noblast  have  no  bathroom  in  their  housing  (91%  for  poor  families  in  Kashkadarya  and  83.5%  in  Navoi).  In  the  rural \nsettlements of the project area, no households have access to central sewage. Water consumption in poor families is \n25\u201330%  lower  than  in  non-poor,  especially  in  Kashkadarya  oblast.  The  quality  of  water  consumed  by  poor  families \nconsume  is  also  lower.  Poor  families  have  more  limited  access  to  water  storage\u2014the  construction  of  khauzes  is \ncostly, so poor families have to buy water in small volumes and spend on water delivery. Poor families spend 4% of \nfamily income on potable water in Kashkadarya oblast and 2.4% in Navoi oblast. They also bear 10% higher expenses \non  potable  water  than  non-poor  families  in  Kashkadarya  oblast  and  15%  in  Navoi  oblasts.  This  explains  why \nwillingness-to-pay for improved water supply is higher among poor families, despite low income, compared with non-\npoor families. It should be noted that the project component on potable water supply is focused on poor families, which \nwill benefit more, compared with other families. \n \nC. \n \nIs there a stakeholder analysis? \n \nParticipation was ensured through consultations with key stakeholders (at central and local government level, and in \ncommunities). Key stakeholders of the Project are: (i) poor families, especially women-headed families; (ii) women and \nchildren, who spend a lot of time and effort on delivering water and housework; (iii) old-age pensioners and disabled \npeople,  who  encounter  particularly  significant  problems  in  terms  of  potable  water  supply;  (iv)  local  government;  (v) \nUzbekistan  Communal  Services  Agency  (UCSA);  (vi)  Drinking  Water  Consumers  Unions  (DWCUs);  (vii)  project \nmanagement  unit  (PMU);  (viii)  project  implementation  units  (PIUs);  (ix) private  sector;  (x)  nongovernment \norganizations (NGOs); (xi) community-based organizations; and (xii) policy makers in central and local government. A \nfocus  on  data  collection  and  analysis  was  undertaken  on  vulnerable  population  groups,  especially  the  poor  and \nwomen.  \n \nIs there a participation strategy? \n \nA  participatory  strategy  is  an  integral  component  in  the  design,  implementation,  and  monitoring  of  the  Project.  The \ncommunity development specialists, one for each of the two PIUs, will have overall responsibility for ensuring that the \nstakeholders and communities of the subprojects are fully involved in the planning process and the construction phase \nby setting up DWCUs in each village or selected group of villages. The specialists will work in close cooperation with \nthe  PMU  senior  institutional  expert  to  implement  the  resettlement  plans  (RPs)  and  ethnic  minority  development \nframework (EMDF), monitor the implementation and performance targets of the RPs and EMDF, and prepare progress \nreports for the PMU and PSC.  \n \n \n \n\nParticipation Process \n\n   Yes               \n\n  Yes                \n\n   No  \n\n   No \n\n\f      \n\n   Appendix 11       45    \n\n \n\nGender Development \n\n \nD. \n  \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \n \nThe participation of women in the socioeconomic life of the water and wastewater sectors implies that, to a very great \nextent, project benefits  will accrue to  women as  well as men. There is a need to promote  women\u2019s decision-making \nroles in the planning and management of water supply and sanitation systems through the establishment of DWCUs. \nSpecific  steps  to  enhance  women\u2019s  participation  in  the  Project  include:  (i)  identifying  women\u2019s  groups  in  the \ncommunity; (ii) training women\u2019s community groups to participate in project-related activities, such as health education \nand  gender  issues;  (iii)  training  women\u2019s  organizations,  including  those  representing  poor  women,  in  the  decision-\nmaking  process  including  planning  of  water  supply  and  sanitation  facilities;  and  (iv)  providing  employment \nopportunities for women in the activities of local governments and DWCUs.

The affordability analysis showed that expenses \non water are 2.8% in Kashkadarya and 2.1% in Navoi \noblast. In poor families, these expenses are 1.2 to 1.5 \ntimes higher (4% in Kashkadarya and 2.4% in Navoi). \n \n \nThe Project will not have any negative impact on the \nUCSA employees.

Each subproject includes about 4 to 20 rural villages. The implementation of the Project \nwill require the construction of: (i) transmission pipelines from the source to the service areas; \n(ii)  distribution  pipelines  and  relevant  appurtenances  within  the  villages;  (iii)  pumping  stations, \nreservoirs,  and  chlorination  stations;  (iv)  production  wells;  (v)  pressure  reservoirs;  and \n(vi) service  connections.  The  source  of  water  supply  for  the  subprojects  will  be  provided  from \neither  an  intake  from  existing  transmission  mains  or  a  newly  constructed  production  well. \nResettlement plans (RPs) have been prepared for four core subprojects located in Kamashi and \nKasan rayons (Kashkadarya oblast), and Kyzyltepa and Nurata rayons (Navoi oblast). \n \n2. \nThere  is  a  sufficiently  developed  legislation  in  Uzbekistan  covering  issues  related  to \nresettlement  with  particular  emphasis  on  exemption  of  land  use  and  related  compensation. \nUzbekistan\u2019s Land Code is the main reference text, regulating procedures of land seizure and \nallocation  of  compensation  land.  The  State  Committee  on  Land  Resources,  Geodesy, \nCartography  and  State  Cadastre  is,  with  the  Cabinet  of  Ministers,  the  main  administration \nimplementing the Land Code.  \n \n3. \nThere  are  three  main  categories  of  agricultural  land  users  in  Uzbekistan  and  in  all \nsubproject areas: (i) shirkhats (collective farms), (ii) family farms (farms), and (iii) dekhan farms. \nAccording to the Land Code, land in Uzbekistan is state property. Entitlements for use of land \nare granted and monitored by the state through the rayon and oblast administrations on a lease \nbasis.  The  main  types  of  land  in  the  subproject  area  include:  (i)  settlement  areas; \n(ii) nonclassified  land;  and  (iii)  agricultural  lands,  which  are  subdivided  into  pasture  lands,  \nirrigated and rain-fed lands, and nonproductive lands.  \n \n4. \nEach of the 12 subprojects included in the Project will comprise a number of work sites \nof  generally  moderate  extent.  The  main  implications  are:  (i)  temporary  loss  of  land  use  along \nlinear excavations for pipelines, and (ii) permanent occupation of sites for pumping stations and \nproduction wells over a maximum surface of 0.6 ha. Elevated pressure tanks will occupy smaller \nsurfaces of land estimated at 0.16 ha and can be flexibly located in the outskirts of villages. In \ntotal, about 85\u201390 ha of land will be occupied by the permanent infrastructures included in the \nProject.  Permanent  structures  will  be  located  in  nonclassified  or  pasture  land.  Equivalent \nsurfaces of compensation land will be attributed to the affected families in areas adjacent to the \nlands  being  permanently  occupied  before  construction  works  will  start.  The  transfer  to  the \nlivestock  will  be  immediate  and  no  loss  will  substantially  occur  from  loss  of  pasture  land.  The \nlivestock  guardian,  normally  one  young  farm  family  member,  will  be  only  marginally  affected. \nFarm  workers  in  irrigated  and  rain-fed  agricultural  farm  lands  and  their  families  might  be \naffected. The impacts related to temporary loss of use of irrigated and rain fed agricultural land \nis marginal and the proposed compensation would ensure no loss of family income. \n \nTemporary  occupation  of  land  during  construction  of  the  various  components  of  each \n5. \nsubproject is expected not to last more than 6 months in each construction site. Encroachment \non  cultivated  agricultural  and  pasture  land,  tree  plantations,  and  household  perimeters  will  be \navoided  as  much  as  possible.  There  will  no  be  displacement  of  households  or  other  village \nstructures.  About  215  people  are  expected  to  be  potentially  impacted  as  a  consequence  of \ntemporary occupation of crop lands and another 60 workers will be marginally affected by the \npermanent occupation of land. \n\n\f      \n\n Appendix 12         47    \n\n \n\nSubproject \n\nTable  A12.1: Land Affected and Affected Persons \n\nPermanently Occupied Land  \n(ha) \n\nTemporary Land Occupation \n(ha) \n\nTotal \nSurface of \nAffected \nArea \n\nPasture and \nNonclassified \nLand  \n\nAffected \nPersons\n\nTotal \nAffected \nLand \n\nIrrigated \nLand  \n\nRain-\nFed \nLand \n\nAffected \nPersons\n\n  \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n6.66\n\n24   \n\n2.22 \n\n4\n5\n4\n6\n\nTotal \n\n11.57   \n\n3  9.02 \n\n25\n8\n50\n4\n\n2.4\n3\n2.4\n3.6\n\n13\n4\n8\n5\n9\n\n8\n49\n32\n215\n\n2.4 \n3 \n2.4 \n3.6 \n\n2.4\n4.2\n3.6\n3.6\n1.2\n\n2.4 \n4.2 \n3.6 \n3.6 \n1.2 \n\n14.4\n5.2\n10.8\n6\n18.8\n\n4.32\n1.56\n3.24\n1.8\n5.64\n\n27.4\n109\n57.4\n390.2\n\n8.22\n32.7\n17.22\n90.38\n\n28.92\n30.08\n60\n22.2\n\n2.8\n3.68\n3.6\n36.48\n\n8.22 \n16.35 \n11.48 \n94.1 \n\n2.8 \n3.7 \n3.6 \n36.48 \n\n5.76 \n1.56 \n3.78 \n2.4 \n3.76 \n\n \n4  \n7  \n6  \n6  \n2  \n \n4  \n6  \n6  \n60.0   \n\nKasan \nKamashi \nKiziltepa \nNurota \nOther subprojects in Kashkadarya \nYakkabag \nChirakchi \nKitab \nShakhrisabz \nMirishkor \nOther subprojects in Navoi \nKanimeh \nHatirchi \nNovbahor  \n \nha = hectare. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n6. \nThe exact routing of the pipelines and the location of the permanent infrastructure to be \nconstructed cannot be determined in detail at the project preparation stage. Measures are being \ntaken  at  the  design  stage  and  during  construction  to  avoid  locating  permanent  structures\u2014\npumping stations, production wells, and related protection perimeters (literally sanitary zones)\u2014\nin  irrigated  lands.  Pipelines  are  planned  to  be  constructed  as  far  as  possible  along  existing \nstructures, such as roads and railways. However, it is assumed that some works, such as lying \nof transmission lines, will take place across cultivated, rain\u2013fed, or irrigated lands.  \n \n7. \nCompensation  to  entitled  land  users  for  loss  of  agricultural  revenue  due  to  temporary \noccupation of land will be in the cash equivalent of the average total revenue from crops in the \noccupied  land  for  one  crop  year.  This  is  estimated  as  the  equivalent  average  value  of  annual \ncrop  earned  from  one  hectare  of  the  occupied  land  over  the  last  3  years  preceding  the \nconstruction  works.  An  entitlement  matrix  is  provided  in  Table  A12.2.  The  project  budget  for \nresettlement is estimated at SUM140 million ($129,000). The costs for restoration of land in the \nexcavation areas are included in the subproject\u2019s construction cost.  \n \n8. \nThe  sector  loan  will  be  approved  in  2005  and  the  loan  is  expected  to  be  effective  by \nearly  2006.  The  first  18  months  will  include  detailed  design  of  subprojects  and  approval \nprocedures  required \nfor  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  disbursements.  The  project \nmanagement unit (PMU) will establish a schedule for implementation of the resettlement plan in \neach subproject. The project implementation unit (PIU) will be responsible for implementation of \nthe resettlement plan in each subproject. The PMU will be responsible for a monitoring plan to \nmeasure  the  effectiveness  of  the  subproject  resettlement  plans.  The  PIU  will  carry  out \nmonitoring  and  reporting  of  the  resettlement  plans  in  all  subprojects  and  report  progress  in \nquarterly reports. In accordance with ADB requirements, an independent body will be recruited \nby  the  Executing  Agency,  to  monitor  and  evaluate  resettlement.  The  monitor  will  provide \nsemiannual investigations and reporting to the Uzbekistan Communal Services Agency (UCSA) \nand ADB during implementation, and annually for 2 years thereafter for a total assignment effort \nof 12 person-months. \n\n \n\n\f48 \n\nAppendix 12 \n\nType of Loss \n\nEntitled Persons \n\nCompensation and Rehabilitation \nMeasures \n\nImplementation Issue \n\nTable A12.2:  Entitlement Matrix \n\nI.

For  the  overall  Project,  the  analysis  covers  the:  (i)  rationale  for  government \nintervention,  (ii)  goals  of  the  investment  plan,  (iii)  general  design  of  the  investment  plan,  and \n(iv) strategy to attain the plan. The economic analysis also evaluates the individual subprojects \nrelative to the selection criteria, focusing on least-cost analysis undertaken. \n \nB. \n\nAnalysis of the Project \n \n1. \n \n2. \nThe  rationale  for  government  intervention  results  from  increasing  concern  over  the \nworsening  water  supply  situation  in  the  rural  settlements,  defined  by  low  and  declining \ncoverage,  made  worse  by  the  slow  pace  of  development  in  the  sector.  Despite  government \nefforts at social construction in rural settlements, access to water supply\u2014especially for remote \nand  hard-to-reach  areas\u2014is  still  rudimentary.  This  has  also  led  to  negative  impacts  on  the \nhealth of the poor, which recent studies confirm are the most affected. \n \nAlthough 70% of the total rural settlements are currently within reach of centralized water \n3. \nsupply,  only  about  30\u201340%  of  the  rural  population  still  has  real  access  to  partially  functioning \npiped water supply systems nationwide. The reason is that most of these supply systems are in \nvarious stages of deterioration and some are dysfunctional. As a result, residents are forced to \nuse alternative, unsafe sources of water from rivers or canals. Recognition by the Government \nof  the  seriousness  of  the  problem  led  to  reforms  being  undertaken  in  the  sector.  Recent \nregulations have been passed to promote decentralization in the provision of these services. In \nthe  case  of  rural  water  supply,  the  responsibility  for  and  ownership  of  assets  have  been \nconferred on the oblast or provincial administration, with operation and maintenance handled by \nthe  oblast  vodokanal  through  the  rayon  or  district  vodokanal  under  its  stewardship.  By  detail, \nwater  supply  services  in  rural  settlements  are  under  the  rayon  vodokanal.  However,  studies \nshow that where such centralized systems exist, services only continue to deteriorate because \nlittle  could  be  done  in  improving  and  rehabilitating  the  systems  due  to  lack  of  funds. \nUnrealistically  low  tariffs  with  a  poor  basis  or  no  basis  of  determination  result  in  very  limited \nrevenue generation. Additionally, rayon vodokanals depend on subsidies from the oblast budget \nto cover financial needs for large-scale system repair or extension works. Consequently, under \nthe  present  institutional  context,  rayon  vodokanals  are  neither  institutionally  nor  financially \nindependent water utilities. Water supply is rationed only a few hours a day and schedules are \noften not met. Many rayon vodokanals on which rural water supply depends are characterized \nby  inefficient  operations,  poor  service  levels,  poor  state  of  repair,  weak  institutional  capacity, \nscarcity  of  water  resources,  and  financial  inadequacy.  In  the  past,  agro-vodokanals  managed \nrural  systems,  as  most  are  situated  along  agricultural  areas  encompassing  rural  settlements. \nSome agro-vodokanals still exist but are now being gradually phased out by virtue of a law that \ndeclares their abolition. Another entity, the Obi Hayot, continues to be a service provider in rural \nsettlements,  but  its  interests  lie  in  managing  systems  that  guarantee  profits,  and  there  are \nprobably no networks of the scale targeted in the proposed sector investment plan, which could \noffer the same incentive in the near term. \n \nGovernment  involvement  in  the  investment  plan  is  justified because  there  is  significant \n4. \nscope  to  improve  water  supply  in  rural  settlements  through  the  provision  of  financial  and \ntechnical  support  and  institutional  strengthening,  which  only  the  Government  can  effectively \n\n\f50 \n\nAppendix 13 \n\nprovide at present. Despite steps taken to improve physical facilities through social construction, \nthe actual flow of benefits from such undertakings is minimally felt by target beneficiaries. The \ninstitutional  and  economic  reforms  embedded  in  the  decentralization  efforts  have  progressed \nvery slowly within the sector, as with the others, as the country continues to assimilate a market \neconomy.  The  Government  transferred  the  responsibility  and  ownership  of  existing  assets  to \nvodokanals through recent regulations, and private sector participation is opening up. However, \nthere  is  a  defined  need  for  central  level  management  to  sufficiently  develop  and  address  the \nmedium-  and  long-term  needs  of  rural  water  supply  in  Uzbekistan.  The  diverse  problems \ncharacterizing the oblast and rayon vodokanals assigned to supply service to rural settlements \nis a separate issue that requires government attention. The Government has taken initial steps \nto  strengthen  oblast  administrations  and  oblast  vodokanals  through  its  previous  issuances. \nThese entities now require further economic support and regulation to persevere to the intended \neffects.  The  Government  should  also  attract  external  financial  resources  to  free  its  own  to \nsupport  related  prioritized  programs  on  health  safeguards  and  environmental  protection, \nempowerment of village communities through direct participation in planning and management \nof their water utilities, and promoting health awareness for quality life and economic usefulness. \n \n5. \nThe  economic  rationale  is  likewise  sound  because  addressing  the  rural  water  supply \nproblems  closes  the  existing  disparities  in  service  provision  between  urban  and  rural \ncommunities,  promotes  economic  growth  in  the  rural  settlements,  and  supports  government \nmandated  functions  related  to  regulating  the  monopolistic  characteristics  of  water  trunk  main \nsupply and distribution and provision of public goods. \n \n6. \nThrough the investment plan, the Government is taking the lead in increasing coverage \nof  the  needs  of  rural  settlements  in  drinking  water  and  sanitation  while  closing  the  disparities \nthat  exist  in  the  service  levels  between  urban  centers  and  rural  areas.  After  gaining \nindependence, the emphasis of water supply investments was on construction of long-distance \ntrunk  and  secondary  distribution  mains  that  focused  mostly  on  more  feasible  urban  areas. \nCurrently,  the  strategy  has  shifted  to  include  unserved  rural  settlements  when  pursuing \nrehabilitation and new construction of transmission and distribution networks, while ensuring the \nprovision of services to remote and hard-to-reach areas by encouraging the use of alternative \nwater  resources,  including  desalination.  Under  the  National  Water  Supply  Development \nProgram (NWSDP) the Government has estimated the total funding needs for the urban water \nsupply sector to attain almost full coverage by 2010 at $2,423 million. For the rural water supply \nsector,  including  remote  and  hard-to-reach  areas,  total  requirements  are  estimated  at \n$2,636 million. Total funding requirements for the whole sector amount to $5,059 million. \n\n7. \nTo  help  promote  economic  growth,  the  Government  is  prioritizing  economic  reforms \nthrough  the  sector  investment  plan  by:  (i)  ensuring  financial  sustainability  based  on  effective \ntariff  and  cost  recovery  systems  and  the  adoption  of  water  metering  programs;  (ii)  planning \nadequate  investments  through  effective  financial  management  and  budgeting,  and  by  tapping \ndomestic  and  external  sources;  (iii)  achieving  further  decentralization  of  water  supply  and \nsanitation services through the institutional and financial strengthening of oblast administrations \nand vodokanals, and the establishment of Drinking Water Consumer Unions (DWCUs) at rural \ncommunity level; (iv) encouraging private sector participation through competitive procurement \nprocedures  and  private  investments  in  water  supply  and  sanitation  (WSS)  related  goods  and \nservices; and (v) supporting public-private partnerships in the ownership and operation of WSS \nutilities. The Government envisions that improved general welfare of the rural population, mostly \nconsisting  of  agricultural  and  industrial  workers  in  the  project  regions,  will  lessen  poverty  and \nincrease  productivity.  Increased  productivity  will  lead  to  higher  incomes  for  workers  in  these \n\n\f      \n\n   Appendix 13       51    \n\n \n\nareas with the potential advancement attracting private investments that will further contribute to \nthe development of these areas. \n\n8. \nFurther  to  the  privatization  and  public-private  partnership  initiatives  under  the  program, \none of the Government\u2019s main polices is the establishment of a legal basis for denationalization \nof  vodokanals,1  implying  sales  of  shares  of  vodokanals  through  initial  public  offerings.  This  is \none of the foremost steps taken towards the privatization of the sector. Considering the strategic \nimportance  of  the  sector,  majority  ownership  is  still  being  kept  in  the  hands  of  the  state. \nHowever, there is a need for full privatization in the future for these public utilities to increase the \nefficiency of operations. More action on issues of public participation in the sales process should \nbe taken because current practice shows that vodokanal shares ending up being bought mostly \nby the vodokanal directors themselves. \n \n\n2. \n\nGoals of the Project \n\n9. \nThe goals of the Project are consistent with government economic policy, which ensures \nsustainable  growth  by:  (i)  improving  the  living  conditions  of  the  population  through  focused \nsocial  infrastructure  development,  and  (ii)  closing  the  disparity  between  urbanized  towns  and \nrural  villages.  Major  programs  have  been  undertaken,  or  are  currently  ongoing  in  the  public \nutilities sector, in which the Government has recognized the acute inadequacy of water supply \nin  rural  areas.  Until  1999,  the  Government  mostly  directed  investments  towards  long-distance \ntransmission mains and externally-financed water supply projects through central development \nplanning  mechanisms  like  the  Public  Investment  Program  (PIP),  while  local  urban  and  rural \nwater  supply  investments  were  borne  by  oblast  administrations.  Since  then,  the  Government \nhas  included  specific  targets  in  its  focus  for  the  development  of  water  supply  in  rural \nsettlements,  and  sourcing  of  internal  and  external  investments  to  economically  support  these \nplans,  through  implementation  guidelines  in  successive  cabinet  regulations.  Guided  by  the \nNWSDP  for  the  period  2000\u201310,  the  Government  envisaged:  (i)  construction  of  water  supply \nsystems and raising the level of drinking water supply to benefit 85% of the rural population by \n2010, increasing to 100% by 2020; and (ii) the provision of remote and hard-to-reach areas with \nalternative water supply sources. The NWSDP also gives particular emphasis to: (i) adoption of \nleast-cost technologies, (ii) demand management directed towards economic use of water and \nreduction of wastage, (iii) financial sustainability through gradual cost recovery of infrastructure \ncapital and targeted subsidies, and (iv) further decentralization of sector services. \n\n10. \nThe goals set out in the development of the proposed Project are directly relevant to the \ninvestment  plan  and  in  line  with  the  plan\u2019s  goals.  By  2010,  the  Project  aims  to  provide  water \nsupply  to  about  250,000  inhabitants  in  170  rural  settlements,  some  of  which  are  situated  in \nremote  and  hard-to-reach  areas.  The  rural  settlements  of  Kashkadarya  and  Navoi  have  been \nidentified  in  the  NWSDP  as  among  those  areas  in  the  country  with  the  lowest  water  supply \nservice coverage. Most of the rural settlements targeted in the Project have had no experience \nwith piped water supply service at all. Scarcity of water resources in many of these settlements \nhas  been  given  high  significance  in  project  planning.  Alternative  water  sources  have  been \nassessed as part of least cost planning. \n \n11. \nIn  Kashkadarya  and  Navoi  rayon  or  town  centers  where  centralized  water  supply \nsystems exist, coverage is reportedly about 60\u201370%. In the villages of the two oblasts, no such \nsystems exist. However, by 2010, when the subprojects will have been completed, coverage is \n\n                                                 \n1   Resolution  of  the  CM  No.  97  of  26  March  2002  on  Complementary  Measures  to  Secure  the  Realization  of \n\nPrograms of Denationalization and Privatization, Attraction of Foreign Investments. \n\n\f52 \n\nAppendix 13 \n\nexpected to reach 11% in Kashkadarya villages, and 25% in Navoi. Although this falls short of \nplanned targets compared to the Program, the Government will have already achieved much in \nterms of initial steps in the two regions. \n \nThe subprojects will contribute to the promotion of water conservation and prevention of \n12. \nwastage  through  the  installation  of  water  meters  and  appropriate  tariff  setting.  Tariffs  will  be \nstructured so that they  are cost-based and acceptable to the consuming public, especially the \npoor who make up the majority population. Tariffs will likewise be set to cover all operating and \nmaintenance  costs  and  depreciation.  Consistent  with  decentralization  policies,  subprojects  will \nestablish  DWCUs  at  village  level  to  strengthen  community  ownership  of  the  water  supply \nsystem  and  help  improve  sustainability.  Communities  will  be  educated  in  proper  water  and \nsanitation practices, and their responsibilities as beneficiaries. \n \n13. \nTo monitor progress in attaining the goals discussed above, the following indicators (as \nset out in RCM 278) will continue to provide guidance in planning and implementing investment \nschemes:  (i)  main  water  source,  (ii)  location  and  distance  from  service  area  (km),  (iii)  total \ncapacity  of source  (m3/day),  (iv)  total  capacity of  urban/rural  water  pipelines  (m3/day),  (v)  total \nwater  supplied  (m3/day),  (vi) \ntotal  water  sold/consumed  (m3/day),  (vii)  percentage  of \nunaccounted-for-water,  (viii)  length  of  transmission  mains  (km),  (ix)  length  of  distribution \npipelines  (km),  (x)  percentage  of  population  coverage,  (xi)  cost  of  planned  development \nscheme,  (xii)  per  capita  cost  of  development  or  improvement,  (xiii)  per  capita  consumption \n(liters/day), and (xiv) total number of in-yard connections. \n\n14. \nTo  further  give  direction  to  the  implementation  of  the  schemes,  adherence  to  the \nfollowing guidelines is also monitored: (i) organization in the supply and consumption of water; \n(ii) systematic activities on identification and reduction of water leakages in distribution networks \nand in-house systems; (iii) replacement of deteriorated pipelines; (iv) implementation of efficient \nwater  tariff  policy,  which  ensures  self-sufficient  operations  and  possibility  for  expansion; \n(v) measures taken to protect poor consumers; (vi) monitoring of usage of potable water supply \nfor purposes other than drinking, e.g., watering of crops, substitute for irrigation, etc.; (vii) use of \nwater saving technologies in operations; and (viii) type and frequency of water quality testing.  \n\n3. \n\nDesign of the Plan \n\n \n15. \nThe  goals  of  the  plan  will  be  achieved  at  least  cost  through  centralized  water  supply \nsystems  developed  from  least-cost  alternatives.  A  structured  approach  will  be  adopted  for  the \nappraisal and approval of subprojects included in the plan. Subprojects will be selected based \non availability and the type of water resources, and must also be among the number of villages \nthat  are  in  most  urgent  need  of  water  supply.  For  Kashkadarya  and  Navoi,  the  oblast \nadministrations  must  also  submit  a  request  providing  evidence  that  the  basic  conditions  for \ninclusion of subprojects are fulfilled. These include: (i) willingness of the settlers to establish and \nconstitute a DWCU and select a board from among union members; (ii) willingness to set, apply, \nand  pay  water  tariffs  for  water  consumed;  and  (iii)  commitment  of  the  local  administrations  to \nimplement a resettlement plan for settlers that may be affected by the constructed facilities. A \nsocial  survey  conducted  in  the  two  oblasts  reports  a  relatively  high  demand  for  the  proposed \nservice.  The  willingness  of  beneficiaries  to  pay  for  centralized  water  supply  is  84%  in \nKashkadarya and 74% in Navoi. \n \nThe  composition  of  subprojects  is  determined  foremost  by  water  resource  type  and \n16. \navailability.  In  areas  without  groundwater  resources,  contiguous  or  close-to-contiguous \nsettlements at a reasonable distance from an existing trunk main may constitute a subproject. \n\n\f      \n\n   Appendix 13       53    \n\n \n\nWhere  groundwater  is  available,  a  subproject  may  include  a  cluster  of  settlements  served  by \nindividual  production  wells.  A  single  well  source  may  serve  one  or  several  villages.  Each \nsubproject may comprise 10 to 20 villages, all within the political boundaries of a single rayon. \nEach  centralized  water  supply  system  will  be  designed  at  least  cost,  in  terms  of  location, \nplanning  horizon,  and  design.  The  investments  will  be  prioritized,  since  the  size  and  scope  of \nthe  plan  prevent  all  investments  from  being  made  simultaneously.  Availability  of  local \ncontractors,  timely  release  of  counterpart  funds,  and  capacity  of  project  management  and \ndesign institutes will be considered. \n \n17. \nUzbekistan\u2019s  freshwater  resources  are  limited  and  localized,  particularly  groundwater, \nwhich  commonly  allows  the  development  of  the  most  economic  water  supply  systems \nalternatives  for  small  and  decentralized  systems.  The  scarcity  of  the  resource  also  limits \nalternative  solutions  for  water  supply,  particularly  for  small  centers.  Surface  water  of  quality \nsuitable for development is rare and can only be developed economically for large-scale water \nsupplies.  In  implementing  the  plan  on  a  large  scale,  the  Government  has  prioritized  and \ninvested efforts in the construction and rehabilitation of long-distance, interregional, or regional \nwater supply transmission systems, fed from centralized, proven sustainable, water resources, \nas  the  least-cost  choice.  This  is  in  comparison  with  the  next  most  expensive  and \nenvironmentally unfriendly solution: desalination of locally available groundwater, as a strategic \nplan  to  meet  the  goal  of  covering  most  of  the  country\u2019s  population  with  water  supply  at \naffordable costs. \n \n18. \nFor supply of rural settlements with drinking water, the main option is the development of \nlocal groundwater resources, when available, as the most economic solution for water supply. \nThis is true particularly when several settlements can be fed from one single production well. In \narid areas and areas without freshwater resources, the least-cost solution for the supply of small \nagglomerations  remains  the  supply  from  the  trunk  mains,  provided  the  distance  of  the \nsettlement  from  the  trunk  main  is  affordable  in  terms  of  pipeline  investments.  The  least-cost \nsolution  in  this  case  consists  of  having  a  maximum  number  of  neighboring  villages  supplied \nfrom  a  single  pumping  station,  a  model  similar  to  that  adopted  for  systems  supplied  from \ngroundwater  wells.  Similar  types  of  models  have  been  developed  and  applied  in  defining \nsubprojects  and  selecting  least-cost  improvement  schemes  under  the  technical  assistance  for \nthe proposed Project. \n \n19. \nUnder  the  KNRWSSP,  12  subprojects  have  been  selected  following  the  screening  and \nselection  process  given  in  Supplementary  Appendix  F  and  summarily  discussed  above.  The \ncriteria used in the selection process followed discussions and consultations between the oblast \nadministration and vodokanal representatives, rural community leaders representing future and \npotential  beneficiaries,  representatives  of  the  Executing  Agency  (EA),  and  design  institute \nconsultants. The 12 subproject areas and corresponding supply source options are as follows: \n \n\nKaskadarya \n \n1.  Kamashi \n \n2.  Kasan \n \n3.  Kitab \n4.  Mirishkor \n \n5.  Shahrisabz  \n6.

Hatirchi \n \n \n20. \nOne  of  the  procedural  requirements  for  subproject  selection  and  appraisal  is  the \ndevelopment of feasibility studies, which include both financial and economic analysis, for each \nsubproject  under  consideration.  Inclusion  of  the  subproject  in  the  list  would  require  subproject \ninvestment  to  be  financially  and  economically  viable.  Viability  will  be  assessed  based  on  the \nstandard  financial  and  economic  cost-benefit  analysis.  Financial  viability  would  require  the \nfinancial internal rate of return (FIRR) to be higher than the cost of capital, and that benefits are \nbased on tariffs affordable to consumers. Economic viability would be measured in terms of the \neconomic  internal  rate  of  return  (EIRR),  which  should  be  greater  than  the  opportunity  cost  of \ncapital.  In  instances  where  economic  benefits  are  not  quantifiable,  economic  analysis  will  be \nsupplemented  with  socioeconomic  evaluation  that  would  aid  the  assessment.  A  critical \nsensitivity  analysis  will  complete  the  cost-benefit  analyses  and  the  socioeconomic  evaluation \nconsidering the impacts of alternative assumptions, risks, and imponderables.  \n \nC. \n \n\nAnalysis of the Individual Subproject \n\n1. \n\nLeast-Cost Analysis of Individual Subprojects \n\n \nEach subproject included in the list is designed to meet the goals of the Project at least \n21. \ncost. The least-cost analysis includes all feasible options for a given subproject, and considered \nvariations in location, planning horizon, and design. \n\nA  minimum  of  two  and  a  maximum  of  four  alternatives  were  assessed  for  each \n22. \nsubproject  based  on  the  feasibility  study  options.  The  supply  alternatives  considered  are  as \nfollows: (i) distribution network supplied by interregional transmission mains, (ii) freshwater from \ngroundwater  wells,  (iii)  desalinized  water  from  groundwater  wells,  and  (iv)  surface  water  from \nriver or canal. \n\n2. \n\nGeneral Assessment of Individual Subprojects \n\nAside  from  being  least-cost,  subprojects  must  be  economically  justified.  Standard \n23. \nbenefit-cost  analysis  has  been  undertaken  to  strengthen  the  economic  justification  of \nsubprojects.  The  benefit-cost  analysis  followed  standard  Asian  Development  Bank  guidelines. \nThe  EIRRs  have  been  derived  for  the  individual  subprojects.  The  EIRR  for  the  representative \nsubprojects  range  from  23%  to  36%  in  Kashkadarya,  and  averages  26%  for  those  in  Navoi. \nSensitivity tests indicate that the results are robust in all parameters. The proposed investments \nare therefore economically justified. \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f      \n\n \n\n   Appendix 14       55    \n\n \n\nFINANCIAL ANALYSIS \n\n \n\nIntroduction \n\nA.  \n \n1. \nFinancial  analysis  was  prepared  in  accordance  with  the  Guidelines  for  the  Financial \nGovernance and Management of Investment Projects Financed by the ADB and the Framework \nfor the Economic and Financial Appraisal of Urban Development Sector Projects. The analysis \ndetermines  the  level  of  cost  recovery  from  users  required  to  cover  all  operation  and \nmaintenance  (O&M)  expenses  and,  eventually,  capital  to  achieve  financial  sustainability.  The \nanalysis was carried out for four representative core water supply subprojects. \n \nB. \n \n2. \nProjections  are  based  on  information  in  the  final  feasibility  study  reports.  Projections \nusing  pro  forma  financial  statements  are  in  nominal  terms  and  are  shown  until  2020. \nCalculations of the financial internal rate of return (FIRR), extending to 2030, are in real terms \nand include a residual value that incorporates replacements. \n\nFinancial Projections \n\n \n1. \n\nSystem Operation and Maintenance \n\n \n3. \nThe  projections  are  prepared  on  increment  basis,  on  the  assumption  that  each \nsubproject will be operated by Drinking Water Consumers Unions (DWCUs) at community level, \nand that DWCUs are yet to be organized and trained on system O&M at project implementation. \nAt  this  point,  DWCUs  are  assumed  to  operate  as  service  utility  organizations  responsible  to \nprovide  water  supply  service  at  village  level,  undertake  minor  system  maintenance,  set  and \ncollect  tariffs,  and  issue  directives  on  improvement  of  service  delivery.  Institutionally,  DWCUs \nwill be under the umbrella of the oblast vodokanal (water supply and sanitation agency), which \nencompass DWCU service areas, in terms of providing technical training, engineering support, \nand institutional advice. The institutional development component of the Project will ensure that \nDWCUs  gain  the  status  of  certified  utility  organizations.  During  the  early  years  of  operation, \nwhen  DWCUs  will  not  have  attained  financial  self-sufficiency,  the  umbrella  vodokanal, \nsupported  by  oblast  administration,  will  provide  an  operational  subsidy  to  cover  all  cash \nrequirements, \nthat  oblast \nadministration/oblast  vodokanal  may  recover  such  subsidies  when  DWCUs  finally  attain  self-\nsufficient levels. \n \n2. \n\nincluding  partial  depreciation.  Projected \n\nCost and Financing Assumptions \n\ntariffs  are  set  so \n\n \n4. \nThe investment cost consists of all civil works and equipment, other development costs \n(engineering  studies  and  supervision),  and  taxes  and  duties.  O&M  costs  include  expenses  for \npersonnel  salaries,  power  and  fuel,  and  plant  and  equipment  maintenance.  Annual  domestic \ninflation is assumed at 7% throughout the projection period. Depreciation is assumed at 2% for \ncivil  works  and  5%  for  mechanical  and  electrical  equipment.  Capital  outlays  during  post-\nconstruction  are  budgeted  to  replace  fully  depreciated  assets  during  the  operational  stage. \nAsset replacements are to be financed out of net operating income. \n \n5. \nThe  investment  will  be  financed  through  an  ADB  loan  and  equity  contribution  from  the \noblast  administration.  Terms  of  the  ADB  loan  to  the  Government  of  Uzbekistan  include  a  32-\nyear  loan  period  with  an  8-year  grace  period,  and  interest  of  1%  during  the  grace  period  and \n1.5%  thereafter.  The  arrangement  will  be  that  the  ADB  loan  proceeds  will  be  relent  by  the \nGovernment  to  the  Uzbekistan  Communal  Services  Agency  (UCSA)  at  the  same  terms  and \nto  oblast \nconditions  as \nadministrations/oblast  vodokanals  on  the  same  terms  and  conditions.  Loan  repayment  will  be \nthe responsibility of the oblast administrations/oblast vodokanals from tariff collections at DWCU \nlevel. \n\nloan  agreement.  UCSA  will  on-lend \n\nthe  original \n\nfunds \n\nthe \n\n\f56 \n\nAppendix 14 \n\n \n\n \n\nTariffs, Cost Recovery, and Viability Parameters \n\n3. \n6. \nSubproject  tariffs  are  calculated  based  on  the  following  cost  recovery  principles:  (i)  all \nO&M cost recovery from the start of operation, and (ii) all O&M cost from start of operation and \npartial  recovery  of  depreciation  during  the  initial  years,  graduating  into  full  cost  recovery  in \nsucceeding years as affordability levels permit. \n \n7. \nTariffs are likewise calculated so that they remain within the affordability of low-income \nhouseholds,  set  at  about  5%  of  average  household  income.  At  the  projected  tariff  levels,  the \nsubproject is deemed viable when the FIRR is higher than the weighted average cost of capital \n(WACC).  Additionally,  debt-coverage  ratios  are  computed  to  determine  subproject  capacity  to \nrepay  the  loan,  thus  \u201cfreeing\u201d  oblast  administration/oblast  vodokanal  from  this  obligation.  With \nexcess cash available after covering all other cash requirements, oblast administrations/oblast \nvodokanals  may  recover  the  amount  earlier  extended  to  DWCUs  as  operational  subsidy.  As \naffordability  of  tariffs  is  a  critical  issue  during  the  initial  years  of  subproject  operation,  the \nGovernment  will  commit  to  subsidize  part  of  depreciation  until  DWCUs  gain  the  capacity  to \ncover depreciation. \n \nC. \n\nFinancial Evaluation \n1. \nCurrently, in the subproject areas of Kashkadarya and Navoi, water vendors charge the \n8. \nhousehold  per  water  tanker.  Monthly  household  expenditure  for  water  supply  is  on  average \n$3.08  in  Kashkadarya  and  $1.98  in  Navoi,  from  different  sources  of  water  supplied.  Average \nmonthly household water consumption is 1.97 cubic meters (m3) in Kashkadarya and 2.23 m3 in \nNavoi. Water acquired from water tankers is for drinking purposes. Where vodokanal systems \nexist,  connected  households  are  charged  $0.03  per  m3,  although  the  current  system  of \nmeasurement  does  not  necessarily  reflect  actual  consumption.  Water  consumption  and \nexpenditures and current average tariffs in the oblasts are shown in Table A14.1. \n \n\nProposed Tariffs \n\n \n\n \n\nTable A14.1: Current Household Water Consumption and Expenditures \n\nSubprojects \n\nWater Tariffs in \nOblasts \n$/m3 \n\nAverage \nHousehold \nSize \n\n  \n\n6.7 \n\nCurrent Water \nSupply \nExpenditure \n\n$/month/HH \n\nWater \nConsumption \n(m3/month/HH) \n\nSource of Water \n\n  \n\nIn Kashkadarya \n\n0.03 \n\n3.08 \n\n1.97 \n\nTM, GWS, WT \n\n6.2 \n\n2.23 \n\n0.03 \n\n1.98 \n\nTM, GWS, WT \n\nIn Navoi \nGWS = groundwater source, HH = household, m3 = cubic meters, TM = trunk main, WT = water delivered by truck \ntanker. \nSource: Household Survey. \n \n9. \nSince the subproject schemes are designed for metered in-yard connections, the tariffs \nare  volume-based  and  structured  to  prevent  wastage.  Currently,  in  the  subproject  areas,  no \ndistinction is made on household rates as a function of their monthly income. This is in line with \ncurrent  government  legislation  and  the  methodology  of  tariff  calculation  applied  by  rayon  and \noblast vodokanals, and approved by the oblast finance department.1 Therefore, the same rates \nare applied for the different categories of households. However, distinction will have to be made \nto account for consumption levels and by consumer category. Two major consumer categories \nhave been identified: domestic and nondomestic. Domestic users are subcategorized into low-\nincome, middle-income, and high-income users. By design, the low-income group uses 60 liters \nper capita per day (lpcd). Using this as base level, a multiplier of 1.25 is applied to the middle-\n\n                                                 \n1   The effective application of approved tariffs is supervised by the Agency for Regulation of Natural Monopolies and \n\nProtection of Competition of the Republic of Uzbekistan, the agency in charge of tariff control. \n\n\f      \n\n   Appendix 14       57    \n\n \n\nincome group for a consumption equivalent to 75 lpcd, and the high-income group, 1.5 over the \nmid-income group for 112 lpcd. This structure aims to differentiate tariffs so that the poor, who \nhave lower disposable income, will at least be able to cover their basic water needs. The higher-\nincome  households,  which  generally  require  more  and  consequently  incur  higher  marginal \ncosts, will pay more. The proposed average tariffs for the four representative core subprojects \nbased on this structure are shown in Table A14.2. \n\nSubproject \n\nKashkadarya \n\nNavoi \n\nKasan \nKamashi \n\nKiziltepa \nNurota \n\n \nTable A14.2: Proposed Average Water Tariffs \nAverage \u2013 All Income \nLevels ($/m3) \n \n0.30 \n0.39 \n \n0.55 \n0.38 \n\nLow-income Level \n($/m3) \n \n0.28 \n0.36 \n \n0.51 \n0.35 \n\n \n10. \nIn  order  to  facilitate  the  acceptance  of  water  charges,  tariffs  at  the  beginning  of \noperations will be set to reach levels villagers are presently spending for water, at over $2 to $3. \nThereafter,  tariffs  will  be  increased  biannually.  The  required  initial  increases  from  the  existing \naverage  base  tariff  (applied  at  rayon  centers)  of  $0.03  are  320%  for  Kasan  subproject  and \n430% for Kamashi subproject, followed by 21% and 24% increases every 2 years. For Kiziltepa \nand  Nurota,  the  initial  increases  are  425%  and  350%  respectively,  followed  by  37%  and  30% \nevery 2 years. At these increases, financial cost recovery principles (para. 6) will be attained. \n\n \n2. \n\nWACC, FIRR, and Sensitivity Analyses \n\n \nThe WACC is calculated in real terms and used as a comparator to FIRR as a basis for \n11. \nmeasuring  subproject  viability.  Funding  sources  are  the  ADB  loan  at  69%  and  capital \ncontributions from Government and oblast administrations at 31%. The assumed nominal costs \nare 1.1% for the ADB loan and 16.82% for government funds. Long-term inflation is estimated at \nan average 2.06% (local costs) and 7.0% (foreign costs). The foreign rate is computed on after-\ntax basis. The WACC in real terms is estimated at 4.49%, as given in Table A14.3. \n\n \nTable A14.3: Calculation of Weighted Average Cost of Capital \nInvestment \n($ million) \n\nInvestment \nWeight (%) \n\nParticulars \n\nADB Loan \n\nGrace period \nRegular period \nWACC, nominal after tax \nLess: foreign inflation rate \nWACC, real \n\nEquity \n\nCurrent interest rate on fixed-term deposits \nPlus: risk premium \nWACC, nominal \nLess: domestic inflation rate \nWACC, real \n\nADB Loan \nEquity \n\nWACC \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n  \n\n25.0 \n11.0 \n\n69.4 \n30.6 \n\nADB = Asian Development Bank, WACC = weighted average cost of capital. \na  Applied at 20% (including corporate income tax of 15% and infrastructure tax). \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n  \n\nCapital Cost  Capital Cost \nAfter Taxa \n1.10 \n \n \n1.10 \n2.06 \n(0.94) \n \n22.00 \n3.00 \n25.00 \n7.00 \n16.82 \n(0.65) \n5.14 \n4.49 \n\n1.38 \n0.25 \n1.13 \n \n \n \n \n22.00 \n3.00 \n25.00 \n \n \n(0.96) \n16.82 \n  \n\n\f58 \n\nAppendix 14 \n\nBased on the above tariff schedule, all four representative core subprojects are found to \n12. \nbe financially viable, with FIRRs ranging from 6.6% (Kiziltepa) to 7.9% (Kasan). Sensitivity tests \nare  undertaken  to  determine  the  effects  of:  (i)  a  20%  increase  in  investment  cost,  (ii)  a  20% \nincrease  in  O&M  cost,  (iii)  a  20%  decrease  in  revenue,  and  (iii)  a  one-year  delay  in  project \nimplementation. The FIRRs in all four cases exceed the WACC computed at 4.49% (considering \nthe opportunity cost of government investment at 18%). The subprojects will cover the full O&M \ncosts from the first year of operations and generate annual revenue surplus on an incremental \nbasis to meet part of the depreciation cost during the first 4 years of operation, after which full \ncost  recovery  (including  loan  interest  cover)  is  achievable.  All  four  subprojects  remain  robust \nunder  all  adverse  circumstances,  except  for  Kamashi  and  Kiziltepa  when  revenue  drops  by \n20%, with both registering FIRRs below WACC. Table A14.4 presents the results of the FIRR \ncalculations and the sensitivity tests. \n \n\nTable A14.4: Summary of Financial Analysis of Subprojects \nKiziltepa \n(%) \n6.6 \n5.3 \n5.1 \n3.3 \n5.2 \n\nChange \n \n+ 20% \n+ 20% \n- 20% \n1 year delay \n\nKamashi \n(%) \n7.1 \n5.6 \n6.2 \n4.2 \n5.9 \n\nKasan \n(%) \n7.9 \n6.5 \n6.8 \n4.9 \n6.6 \n\nNurota \n(%) \n7.3 \n5.8 \n6.7 \n4.8 \n6.2 \n\nScenarios \nBase case \nInvestment cost \nO&M cost \nRevenue \nImplementation \n \n\n \n3. \n\nAffordability Analysis \n\n \n13. \nFor the different subprojects, there is an apparent willingness among the rural population \nto increase water services payments and have piped water connections. Affordability analysis is \nconducted to ensure that the proposed water charges do not go beyond the prescribed limit of \n5% of the monthly household income of the poor. To measure affordability, the average monthly \nwater bill is set against average household income. Based on the planned tariff increases every \n2  years  until  2020,  water  charges  will  be  in  average  3.2%  and  3.7%  of  total  income  of  low-\nincome  households  in  Kasan  and  Kamashi  subprojects  respectively,  during  2010\u20132020.  In \nNavoi, water charges will be in average 4.5% and 3.0% of income of low-income households in \nKyzyltepa and Nurota subprojects, respectively. All the values for the low-income households in \nboth oblasts are within accepted limits.

With the scheduled tariff increases for all four core subprojects, revenues are sufficient \nto  sustain  O&M  costs  and  at  least  part  of  depreciation  during  the  early  years  of  operation, \nyears 1  to  4  (2009\u201312  or  2010\u201313).  The  subprojects  are  expected  to  attain  financial  self-\nsufficiency  by  the  time  loan  payments  start  in Year  9  (2014).
