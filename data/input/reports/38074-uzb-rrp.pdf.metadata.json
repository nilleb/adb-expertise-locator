The \nProject consists of two parts: Part A: physical infrastructure and \nPart B: institutional development. Part A consists of 12 subprojects, \neach covering a cluster of villages. The subprojects will include \ndeveloping and rehabilitating piped water supply systems, public \nand school latrines, and wastewater facilities. Part B includes a \ncapacity-building  program,  a  hygiene  and  sanitation  education \nprogram, and consulting services for project management support. \nThe Project will cover two oblasts (provinces), Kashkadarya and \nNavoi, and will provide basic WSS infrastructure services to about \n250,000 people, about 30% of whom are living below the poverty \nline. \n   \nRationale  Inadequate  delivery  of  rural  WSS  services  caused  by  aging \ninfrastructure,  institutional  constraints,  and  fiscal  difficulties  is \ninhibiting  communities\u2019  access  to  basic  WSS  infrastructure \nservices.  Existing  facilities  are  often  poorly  designed  and \ninsufficiently maintained, and do not adequately provide urgently \nneeded basic services. In line with the Government\u2019s policy to use \na decentralized community management approach, the Project will \nenhance coverage of basic WSS facilities; contribute to improving \nliving and health conditions, in particular for the poor; and improve \nthe institutional, organizational, and managerial capabilities of the \noblasts.  The  sector  lending  modality  is  considered  appropriate \nbecause (i) the Government\u2019s sector policies, strategies, and the \n10-year investment plan for the sector are satisfactory to the Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB),  and  (ii)  the  Uzbekistan  Communal \nServices Agency (UCSA) has gained substantial experience and \ncapacity  through  implementing  the  World  Bank  water  supply \nproject and an ongoing ADB water supply project. ", "iv \nImpact and Outcome  The impact of the Project is to improve living conditions and public \nhealth  in  rural  areas  of  Kashkadarya  and  Navoi  oblasts.  The \noutcome  of  the  Project  is  improved  access  to  WSS  in  project \nareas. The Project will assist the Government in (i) implementing \ninstitutional  reform  for  WSS  infrastructure  services;  and  (ii) \nproviding and upgrading reliable and financially sustainable WSS \nservices  that  will  improve  public  health,  promote  economic \ndevelopment, and reduce rural poverty. \n   \nCost Estimates  The estimated project cost is $36.0 million equivalent, comprising \nforeign exchange costs of $5.6 million and local currency costs \nequivalent to $30.4 million. \n   \nFinancing Plan  ($ million equivalent) \nSource of Fund  Foreign  Local  Total  Percent \nExchange Currency  Cost \nA.

Project implementation will be carried out by the oblast \nproject implementation units to be established in Kashkadarya and \nNavoi oblasts. A project steering committee will be established to \nmonitor  project  implementation  and  ensure  coordination  with \ngovernment policies and other programs. \n   ", "vv \nProcurement  The procurement of civil works, goods, and services to be financed \nby the ADB loan will be undertaken in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines  for  Procurement.  International  competitive  bidding \nprocedures will be applied for supply contracts estimated to cost at \nleast  $1  million  equivalent.  Supply  contracts  worth  less  than \n$1 million equivalent will follow international shopping procedures, \nexcept for supply contracts with a value of less than $100,000 \nequivalent,  which  may  be  procured  by  direct  purchase.  Local \ncompetitive  bidding  procedures  will  be  applied  for  civil  works \ncontracts that are valued at less than $2 million.  \n   \nConsulting Services  The Project will require 680 person-months of consulting services \n(50  person-months  of  international  and  630  person-months  of \ndomestic)  for  (i)  review  of  detailed  design,  (ii)  construction \nsupervision,  (iii)  finance  and  accounting,  (iv)  community \ndevelopment, and (v) project management. The consultants will be \nengaged  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants using quality and cost based selection (QCBS) and \nother  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  the  engagement  of \ndomestic consultants. \n   \nProject Benefits and  The Project is expected to benefit 170 villages with populations \nBeneficiaries  ranging from 300 to 8,000. Overall, about 250,000 people, about \n30% of whom are living below the poverty line, will benefit directly \nfrom the Project through provision of potable quality piped water \nsupply  facilities;  improved  wastewater  drainage  facilities;  and \npublic, school, and private latrines. The Project will improve health \nconditions  by  reducing  waterborne  diseases.  Related  benefits \ninclude time and cost savings from purchasing, fetching, treating, \nand storing water; improved public and family hygiene and health; \nreduced  medical  outlays;  and  increased  productivity  days.  The \ncore subprojects\u2019 economic internal rate of return is 23% to 36%. \nSupport for decentralized community management and capacity \nbuilding will enhance the efficiency and sustainability of rural WSS \nservices in Uzbekistan. \n   \nRisks and Assumptions  Three possible risks have been identified. First, the possibility of \ndelays  in  project  implementation  caused  by  weak  institutional \ncapability to implement, operate, and maintain the water supply \nsystems has been addressed through clear delineation of agency \nresponsibilities  and  inclusion  of  coordination  mechanisms. \nConsiderable preparatory work has been undertaken in potential \nsubproject  communities  regarding  the  current  status  of  water \nsupply facilities, and an initial assessment of required development \nhas  been  carried  out.  Substantial  support  will  be  provided  for \ncapacity  building  through  training  programs  and  consulting \nservices.  \n \n ", "vi \n  Second, potential for delays in project implementation caused by \nlack of local counterpart funds has been addressed by the active \nparticipation of local administration which meets some construction \nsupervision  and  all  land  requirements.  Measures  to  reduce \npossible delays have been discussed with the Government.   \n \nThird, limited financial capability to meet the incremental operation \nand maintenance (O&M) of the expanded water supply systems \nhas  been  managed  by  including  the  institutional  development \nprogram, which should strengthen the capacity to undertake O&M \nof the expanded water supply systems. The Project will be closely \nmonitored, with two reviews per year throughout implementation. \n   \n ", "(cid:54)(cid:48)(cid:111)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:48)(cid:48)(cid:39)(cid:69)

THE PROPOSAL \n   \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nthe Republic of Uzbekistan for the Kashkadarya and Navoi Rural Water Supply and Sanitation \nSector Project. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n \n2.  The  Government\u2019s  development  objectives  are  to  promote  economic  growth,  reduce \npoverty, and provide balanced regional development\u2014including improved water supply and \nsanitation (WSS) services. The country\u2019s WSS facilities are often poorly designed, inadequately \nmaintained, and in a poor state of repair. Rural water supply has particularly suffered from \nbudget cuts since independence. Formerly, an estimated 70% of all rural villages had piped \npotable water supply. Lack of funding for operation and maintenance (O&M) is the main reason \nthat many water supply systems are constantly out of service. In spite of the Government\u2019s \nefforts to reestablish the level of water supply service, the percentage of villages with piped \nwater supply is currently relatively low. Rural areas in the oblasts of Kashkadarya and Navoi are \nparticularly poorly served with piped water supply. Recent surveys show that only about 30% of \nvillages in Kashkadarya and Navoi oblasts have access to piped water supply. Annual funding \nto the sector is generally limited to routine maintenance and repairs. The level of tariffs\u2014\ntargeted to cover O&M costs\u2014is low, collection management is poor, and insufficient money is \nraised to support efficient operation.  \n \n3.  Lack of adequate WSS services also has a large negative impact on community health, \nespecially the poor. In rural areas, people often have to walk long distances only to obtain \ncontaminated water from untreated sources. There are few wastewater collection systems in \nrural areas and waste disposal infrastructure is below acceptable standards. Insufficient and \npolluted drinking water supplies, combined with poor sanitation and hygiene practices, are \ndirectly  linked  to  the  high  incidence  of  waterborne  diseases.  As  a  consequence  of  major \ngovernment reforms in the health sector since 1998, expected life expectancy at birth has \nincreased and the infant mortality rate has decreased substantially. Nevertheless, maternal, \nchild, and infant mortality remain high. Water-related diseases such as hepatitis A, typhoid \nfever, skin allergies, and kidney disease are widespread, particularly in rural areas. In the \nKashkadarya and Navoi oblasts, indicators of infectious morbidity remain significantly high.  \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n \n4.  Sector Policies. Since the promulgation of the Law on Water and Water Use, 1993, the \nGovernment  has  gradually  extended  and  strengthened  the  legislative  framework  covering \nUzbekistan\u2019s needs in the WSS sector, particularly in rural areas. Needs include improvement of \nphysical and institutional structures, promotion of sector decentralization, conservation of water \nresources, and implementation of sound tariff and cost-recovery policies. Uzbekistan\u2019s WSS \npolicy is now underpinned by three legal instruments: (i) the national 10-year water supply \ndevelopment plan approved by the Cabinet of Ministers in 1999, (ii) the Resolution of the \nCabinet  of  Ministers  approved  in  2003  (RCM)  No.  405,  and  (iii)  the  latest  annual  public \ninvestment program approved by the Cabinet of Ministers. \n \n5.  The key objectives of the WSS policy are to: (i) improve water sector services through a \nnational water supply development plan; (ii) attain financial sustainability through an effective ", "2 \ntariff system and cost recovery; (iii) plan adequate investments with domestic and external \nfunding; (iv) achieve further decentralization of WSS services; (v) encourage private sector \nparticipation and public-private partnerships in the sector; (vi) implement hygiene and sanitation \neducation programs in schools; (vii) achieve improved livelihood conditions, particularly for the \nbenefit  of  women  in  rural  areas;  (viii)  ensure  environmental  compliance  by  encouraging \nconservative development of water resources, economic use of water, consistent water quality \ncontrol, and sound management of wastewater; and (ix) improve further operational strategies \nby strengthening the sector\u2019s institutional setup and interagency collaboration, and by promoting \nadequate capacity building. A summary of Uzbekistan\u2019s WSS policy is in Appendix 2 and a full \ndescription is in Supplementary Appendix A. \n \n6.  The Government is targeting the Millennium Development Goal to ensure environmental \nsustainability  and  aims  to  halve  the  number  of  people without  sustainable  access  to  safe \ndrinking water by 2010. Currently, access to safe drinking water is estimated at 30% in rural \nareas and 70% in urban areas. The overall goal of the Government's WSS sector plan is to \nimprove the health and living conditions of the population by providing better access to safe and \nadequate amounts of water supply, and better sanitation services. To achieve this goal, the \nfollowing  objectives  must  be  met:  (i)  invest  in  the  development  of  WSS  infrastructure, \nparticularly in rural areas; (ii) undertake institutional reforms necessary for effective and efficient \ndevelopment and operation of WSS; (iii) implement a system of equitable and transparent tariff \nsetting based on cost recovery objectives, taking into account the needs of the poor; (v) develop \neffective implementation mechanisms, including cost recovery for WSS in market conditions; \nand (vi) involve the private sector in WSS management.  \n \n7.  Sector Investment Plan. The national water supply development plan is based on three \nbasic documents: (i) the 10-year water supply development plan approved by the Government \nin 1999; (ii) the 2003 law providing additional measures to improve of the supply of water and \nnatural gas to rural settlements (RCM No. 405); and (iii) the latest annual investment program \napproved by the Cabinet of Ministers. Under its WSS policy, the Government committed to a  \n10-year  program  (2000\u20132010)  aimed  at  improving  the  supply  of  water  to  urban  and  rural \ncommunities, many of which currently have inadequate or no water supply. This program, \ndeveloped in 1999 and modified in 2003, envisages the construction of water supply systems \nand the improvement of the level of service of drinking water supply to benefit up to 85% of \nUzbekistan\u2019s rural population.  \n \n8.  In  implementing  the  water  supply  development  plan,  the  Government  has  placed \nparticular emphasis on the: (i) development of long-distance, interregional transmission mains, \ncarrying water from its source to urban and rural settlements where no fresh water is available; \n(ii) coverage of a significant part of the urban and rural population with water supply by 2010, \nand full coverage of the rural population by 2020; and (iii) rehabilitation of water supply networks \nin urban centers. Under the plan, the Government estimated the total cost of reconstruction of \nthe urban water supply sector at $896 million until 2005, with an additional $1,527 million \nrequired from 2006 to 2010. The cost of rehabilitation of the rural water supply sector was \nestimated  at  $930  million  (until  2005)  and  $1,706  million  (2006\u20132010).  To  date,  about \n$433 million has been committed by the Government for rehabilitation and extension of the \nlong-distance water transmission mains. Concerning the long-term investment plan, the 2005 \ninvestment  plan  includes  the  estimated  costs  of  planned  post-2010  investments,  covering \n12 WSS projects totaling $363.3 million. An estimated additional $700 million would be needed \nto cover the remaining rural areas with water supply by 2020. In pursuing the objectives of \nimplementing the plan, the Government has undertaken steps aimed at diversifying investments \nand sources of funding. This includes attracting international funding, which is expected to be \n ", "3 \nprovided mainly by ADB and the World Bank, as well as bilateral donors. The summary WSS \nsector  investment  plan  is  in  Appendix  3  and  the  detailed  sector  investment  plan  is  in \nSupplementary Appendix B. \n \n9.  Sector Institutions. Several government agencies are involved in the development and \noperations of the WSS sector. The Uzbekistan Communal Services Agency (UCSA) is the main \nagency responsible for WSS sector development and protection of water sources. UCSA covers \ntasks ranging from regulatory to commercial including: (i) provision of regulatory advice and \nsupport to reforms in the communal services sector, (ii) monitoring the compliance of local \nauthorities and commercial entities with sector policies, and (iii) attracting foreign investment in \nthe sector. The Ministry of Health (MOH) is responsible for implementation of the Government\u2019s \nhealth  and  hygiene  policies,  and  monitors  water  quality  through  the  State  Sanitary  and \nEpidemiological Inspectorate which has branches at oblast and rayon (district) levels. The State \nCommittee for Geology and Mineral Resources is responsible for controlling the exploitation of \ngroundwater sources, and the State Committee for Environmental Protection is responsible for \nensuring compliance with quality standards in natural water resources. The oblast governments \nare responsible for O&M of rural WSS facilities through oblast and rayon vodokanals (water \nsupply and sanitation agencies). \n \n10.  Capacity of the Executing Agency. The Executing Agency (EA) for the Project, the \nUCSA, has the technical, financial, and managerial capability to implement the Project and \nmanage  the  newly  constructed  rural  water  supply  systems  in  the  long  term,  ensuring:  (i) \naffordable cost recovery, (ii) sound water tariff policies, and (iii) appropriate management of the \nnewly constituted WSS utilities. UCSA will have the authority to delegate responsibilities to the \noblast level. Kashkadarya and Navoi oblasts have adequate personnel available and will be \ncontributing  financially  to  the  Project.  UCSA  has  the  capacity  to  establish  the  institutional \nstructures  required  at  the  recipient  level  in  a  timely  and  appropriate  manner,  and  is  also \nequipped to provide the necessary capacity building. UCSA currently satisfies ADB\u2019s minimum \nfinancial  management  requirements  and  has  the  financial  management  capability  to \nsatisfactorily  record  all  transactions  and  balances,  support  the  preparation  of  regular  and \nreliable financial statements and financial monitoring reports, and arrange for annual audits to \nbe carried out in a manner acceptable to ADB. The summary assessment of UCSA\u2019s capacity is \nin Appendix 4 and a detailed assessment is in Supplementary Appendix C. \n \n11.  Lessons Learned. Experience from other externally assisted projects in Uzbekistan and \nADB's  experience  in  similar  projects  indicates  that  the  main  problems  faced  during  the \nimplementation  of  large-scale  rural  WSS  services  projects  relate  to  insufficient  community \nconsultation and participation in the planning and design of subprojects. This contributes to \nnonfunctioning  or  nonestablishment  of  local  utility  agencies,  lack  of  guarantees  for  O&M \nfinancing, inadequate O&M, and weak cost recovery. The need to focus on sustainability of \noperations  has  been  recognized.  Further,  limited  government  experience  in  project \nimplementation has led to delays and slow disbursement in some projects. Another lesson \nlearned concerns the institutional capacity of oblast governments, which lack familiarity with \nADB\u2019s implementation procedures and require training and technical support. These issues \nwere  reviewed  during  project  processing,  and  comprehensive  measures  have  been \nincorporated  in  the  project  design.  The  Government, ADB,  and  other  donor  agencies  are \ncurrently focusing on community consultation and decentralization of implementation. External \nassistance to the sector is in Appendix 5. \n \n12.  Policy Dialogue. A key rationale for ADB support for the sector is ADB\u2019s policy dialogue \nwith the Government and the fact that ADB support for WSS is provided in a policy context. \n ", "4 \nPolicy  dialogue  with  the  Government  in  the  WSS  sector  has  covered  capacity  building, \ndecentralization,  ensuring  a  poverty  focus,  and  institutional  and  financial  sustainability. \nSupplementary  Appendix  D  provides  the  policy  framework  addressing  issues  and  actions \nrequired. The Government has agreed to rehabilitate and expand existing WSS infrastructure in \npoor  rural  areas  using  simple,  least-cost  solutions.  Policy  dialogue  has  also  covered \ndevelopment of local WSS services and the need for further rehabilitation and extension of long-\ndistance water supply transmission mains. Updating of national groundwater resources data is \nessential for the planned decentralization of small-scale water supply systems, which would \nenhance their economic viability. \n \n13.  From  the  institutional  point  of  view,  the  Project  is  designed  to  increase  local-level \nresponsibilities for WSS infrastructure services by decentralizing implementation and O&M, and \nactively  involving  all  stakeholders.  Policy  dialogue  has  covered  local-level  O&M  of  WSS \ninfrastructure facilities, and communities will be involved in O&M of the constructed facilities \nthrough  their  newly  created  Drinking  Water  Consumers  Unions  (DWCUs).  The  process  of \ndecentralization of responsibilities in the WSS sector requires a corresponding strengthening of \nthe  sector  institutions  at  central  level\u2014but  particularly  at  oblast  level\u2014to  provide  close \nmonitoring of the performance of the new DWCUs and undertake correction measures for poor \nperformers. \n \n14.  Sector  Lending  Approach.  The  Project  has  been  formulated  in  line  with  the \nGovernment\u2019s  sector  policies,  strategy,  and  investment  plan.  The  Government  has  well \nformulated water sector policies, development objectives, and an approach to rural water supply \ninfrastructure development, as well as a development plan for the WSS sector. UCSA, the EA, \nhas significant experience in implementing similar projects supported by the World Bank and \nADB, and has the capability to implement the sector investment plan. The Government has met \nthe three requirements for sector lending: (i) a sector development plan, (ii) the institutional \ncapacity to implement the plan, and (iii) appropriate sector policies.  \n \n15.  ADB  has  reviewed  4  of  the  12  prospective  subprojects  to  confirm  the  approaches, \nmethodology,  and  procedures  of  subproject  selection  and  appraisal\u2014Kamashi  and  Kasan \nsubprojects in Kashkadarya oblast, and Kyzyltepa and Nurota subprojects in Navoi oblast. \nKamashi  and  Kasan  subprojects  are  supplied  with  groundwater  from  local  trunk  main \nShakhrisbz-Karshi-Mubarak  developed  at  the  existing  wellfield  of  Shahkrizabs.  A  list  of \nsubprojects is in Supplementary Appendix E. The Navoi subproject is fed from trunk main \nDamkhodj while the Nurota subproject is supplied with groundwater from production wells. The \nsubprojects  are  viable  in  terms  of  technical,  institutional,  social,  financial,  economic,  and \nenvironmental aspects. The remaining 8 subprojects are being formulated in accordance with \nthe agreed selection criteria and appraisal procedures (Supplementary Appendix F), which \ninclude:  (i)  preparation  of  a  feasibility  study;  and  (ii)  appraisal,  including  preparation  of  a \nsubproject appraisal report.  \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n16.  The impact of the Project is to improve living conditions and public health in rural areas of \nKashkadarya and Navoi oblasts. The outcome of the Project is improved access to WSS in the \nproject areas. The Project will upgrade service levels and delivery efficiency, and achieve better \ncost recovery by providing capacity building and project management support. The Project will \nassist the Government in (i) implementing institutional reform for WSS infrastructure services; \n ", "5 \nand (ii) providing and upgrading reliable and financially sustainable WSS services that will \nimprove public health, promote economic development, and reduce rural poverty. The project \narea will cover Kashkadarya and Navoi oblasts, which have significant levels of poverty (38% in \nKashkadarya and 24% in Navoi) and an identified demand for development of WSS services.  \n \nB.  Outputs \n \n17.  The Project consists of two parts: Part A: Physical Infrastructure; and Part B: Institutional \nDevelopment, which includes a capacity-building program, a hygiene and sanitation education \n(HSE) program, and consulting services for project management support. Summary feasibility \nstudies and short descriptions of the four core subprojects are in Supplementary Appendix G. \n \n1.  Part A: Physical Infrastructure  \n \n18.  Part A includes 12 subprojects, covering about 170 villages with populations ranging from \n300 to 8,000, a total of about 250,000. Each subproject will cover a cluster of up to 20 villages \nwithin one rayon and comprise an integrated water supply system, including improvement of \nsanitation  facilities.  The  subprojects  will  consist  of  the  development  or  rehabilitation  and \nupgrading  of  piped  water  supply  systems,  construction  of  public  and  school  latrines,  and \nparticipatory improvement of wastewater drainage facilities. The development and expansion of \nthe water supply systems will include construction and/or rehabilitation of water source intakes, \nconstruction  of  pumping  stations,  treatment  facilities,  storage  reservoirs,  transmission  and \ndistribution pipelines, and individual yard or house connections. The subprojects will derive \nsupplies from different types of water sources. Most subprojects will use groundwater sources, \nand  will  require  development  and/or  rehabilitation  of  water  supply  systems  and  drilling  of \nproduction wells. The new development of water supply will be coordinated with wastewater \ndrainage measures consisting of basic improvements to village drainage networks. Public and \nschool toilets will be rehabilitated and, where feasible, connected to septic tanks.  \n \n19.  The physical infrastructure component will cover around 10% of the approximately 1,700 \nvillages in the two project oblasts. About 1,200 villages (70%) do not have any formal piped \nwater supply system, while the remaining 500 villages (30%) are supplied from trunk mains or \nlocal  sources.  About  11%  (250,000)  of  the  total  rural  population  in  the  project  oblasts \n(2.2 million) will be covered by the 12 subprojects. Of the 12 subprojects\u2014each involving one \nrayon and an integrated water supply system covering up to 20 villages\u20147 systems will utilize \ngroundwater sources distributed from trunk mains and 5 will be supplied from local groundwater \nsources. On average, the per capita investment cost is about $140.  \n \n20.  Settlements in the project area are divided into three major categories: (i) settlements in \nareas without groundwater resources, which can be supplied by long-distance interregional or \nregional trunk mains; (ii) settlements that can be supplied from a locally developed water \nresource (essentially groundwater); and (iii) settlements in remote areas whose only alternative \nsupply is the desalination of locally available salinized groundwater. In selecting settlements for \nthe subprojects, priority is given to settlements with no water supply or a nonworking water \nsupply system, located near a reliable source of fresh water. In addition, the following criteria \nare  included  in  subproject  selection:  (i)  settlements  with  low-income  level,  (ii)  willingness \nexpressed by locals to have an improved water supply system and establish a DWCU, and \n(iii) settlements included in the government strategy program.1 Preliminary lists of villages to be \nincluded in the subprojects have been established in consultation with oblast, rayon, and local \n                                                 \n1  Resolution of the Cabinet of Ministers (RCM) No. 405 of 17 September 2003. \n ", "6 \nauthorities. The subprojects will have environmental clearances from the State Committee for \nNature Protection and approval by the Cabinet of Ministers. The proposed schemes do not \nrequire displacement of houses but there will be some permanent and temporary land impacts. \nDesign schemes will use appropriate technology and represent the least-cost solution. \n \n21.  UCSA will submit and obtain ADB\u2019s prior approval for subproject proposals. UCSA will \ngive ADB an application for the approval of these subprojects, containing a description and \nappraisal  of  the  subproject  proposal.  All  subprojects  will  be  appraised  by  the  project \nmanagement unit (PMU) within UCSA and approved by the project coordination committee \n(PCC). Only those subprojects found viable will be endorsed for implementation. Documentation \nrelating to the subproject proposals will be retained by UCSA and made available to ADB on \nrequest. \n \n22.  The subprojects are located within five rayons in Navoi and seven rayons in Kashkadarya, \nwhere  there  is  a  significantly  high  percentage  of  poverty  and  water  supply  coverage  is \nparticularly low. A total of 12 subprojects has been identified. Subproject appraisal will adopt an \napproach which takes into account ADB procedures for investment of project loans and national \nguidelines  for  project  feasibility  studies.2  Each  subproject  is  located  within  a  rayon  and \nsettlements within a given subproject are supplied from one type of water source (local sources \nor  trunk  mains).  This  will  facilitate  obtaining  construction  permits,  water  rights,  and  more \nparticularly the establishment of technical support for O&M of pumps and dispatching centers \nbased at the rayon vodokanal. It will also facilitate contract packaging and tendering.  \n \n2.  Part B: Institutional Development \n \n23.  Capacity-Building Program. The capacity-building program will be carried out by the \nUCSA, assisted by the consultants. It involves preparation of training programs, and training of \ncentral  and  local  government  staff  and  other  stakeholders  to  strengthen  their  capacity  to \nefficiently plan, implement, operate, and maintain the WSS systems. The program will provide: \n(i) on-the-job O&M training for operators of the new systems with emphasis on improved water \nquality testing and environmental issues; (ii) training of UCSA, PMU, project implementation \nunits  (PIUs),  and  DWCU  management  in  project  planning,  financial  management,  and \naccounting; and (iii) training of design institutes in improved project appraisal, design, and \nprocurement procedures in accordance with ADB guidelines. The program will focus on four \nareas: (i) O&M training, emphasizing economic use of water; (ii) gradual expansion of the \ninstitutional  structure,  including  assistance  to  local  governments;  (iii)  development  of  local \ngovernments\u2019  planning,  engineering,  and  financial  capability;  and  (iv)  strengthening  the \nGovernment\u2019s health education program. Under the capacity-building activities, the DWCUs will \nbe constituted and trained in each subproject area. About 170 central and local government \nstaff will be trained. A capacity building framework indicating the main training topics, target \nagencies, and stakeholders is in Supplementary Appendix H. \n \n24.  Hygiene and Sanitation Education Program. The HSE program will help beneficiaries \nto improve their understanding of the close interrelationship between hygiene, water, sanitation, \nand health. The program will be formulated by the PMU and staff of health care authorities \nresponsible for surveillance of drinking water quality and sanitation and hygiene surveillance, \nassisted by the consultants. The HSE program will include: (i) the dissemination of media \nmaterials covering selected hygiene, sanitation, and water-related issues; (ii) HSE workshops, \n                                                 \n2 RCM No. 538 of 2 December 2003 on procedures for developing, conducting, examining, and assembling \ndocumentation for investment programs. \n ", "7 \norientation, and training of rayon and village health staff, village leaders, and school teachers in \nall selected communities; (iii) equipping selected health posts and schools with materials and \nsoftware for training; and (iv) development and implementation of an HSE program in schools. \nAbout 200 people, including school teachers and MOH staff will be trained. The HSE program \nwill benefit an estimated 4,000 schoolchildren. \n \n25.  Project Management Support. Consultants will be contracted to help implement the \nProject, provide project management support, and strengthen the implementing capacity of \nsector agencies concerned. The services will: (i) help in project management and monitoring, \n(ii) assist  in  construction  supervision  of  subprojects,  and  (iii)  support  the  planning  and \nimplementation  of  the capacity-building  and  HSE  program.  UCSA  will  involve  at  least  two \nnongovernment  organizations  (NGOs)3  in  consulting  services  for  community  consultation, \ndevelopment  of  subproject  planning,  and  monitoring  subprojects;  and  to  assist  in  capacity \nbuilding.  \n \nC.  Special Features \n \n26.  ADB Water Policy. The Project supports and strengthens several principal elements of \nADB's  water  policy,4  including:  (i)  promoting  a  national  focus  on  water  sector  reform, \n(ii) improving  and  expanding  water  service  delivery,  (iii)  fostering  water  conservation  and \nincreasing system efficiencies, and (iv) improving governance through decentralization and \ncapacity-building. The Project incorporates technology taking into account the local conditions \nand limited capacity of local governments. Community consultations ensure that technologies \nwill be investigated and adopted prior to implementation. Such an approach helps ensure that \ntechnically appropriate and acceptable systems are sustainable. The type of technology for the \nsystems  will  be  guided  by  the  design  criteria.  When  preparing  the  subprojects,  sanitary \nconditions in the subproject area were also reviewed. The sanitation components provide for the \ndevelopment and rehabilitation of public and school sanitation facilities. \n \n27.  Private  Sector  Participation.  The  private  sector  will  participate  in  providing  basic \ninfrastructure services under the Project. Services of local design institutes, suppliers, and \ncontractors will be procured. The Government will encourage the development of (i) a diversified \nprivate consulting capacity, by fostering the transformation of present research and design \ninstitutes into better performing private engineering agencies; (ii) a responsive and efficient \nindustry to supply quality equipment and materials, by accelerating the privatization of state \nequipment manufacturers and material suppliers; (iii) strong civil works contractors capable of \nproviding quality services, by (a) strengthening existing civil works contractors in rural areas, \n(b) adopting mandatory competitive procurement procedures for public enterprises such as \nwater utilities, (c) strengthening technical specifications, and (d) introducing stricter supervision \nof  construction;  (iv)  small-scale  entrepreneurs  who  can  offer  community  services  in  the \nconstruction and O&M of water supply systems and sanitation facilities; and (v) NGOs that can \ncontribute to WSS development. \n \n28.  O&M, Cost Recovery, and Affordability. Sustainable O&M of water supply facilities is a \nmajor problem, especially in rural areas. Analysis of willingness-to-pay (WTP) and affordability \nfor the subprojects shows that a large majority of rural inhabitants in project villages is willing to \npay  for  improved  water  supply.  Full  O&M  cost  recovery  is  expected  to  be  feasible  on \ncommencement for the subprojects, including depreciation in the next 5\u201310 years, through \n                                                 \n3  Women\u2019s committees and elders\u2019 councils have tentatively been proposed. \n4  ADB. 2001.

The  project  design  also  incorporates  organization  at  the  local \ngovernment level, including establishment of DWCUs, systematic staff training, preparation of \nO&M manuals, and periodic monitoring of operations (including consumer satisfaction). The \ncapacity-building  program  will  establish  proper  procedures  for  the  collection  of  fees  and \nsanctions for nonpayment. The charges will be affordable for all customers. Households with \nhouse or yard connections will be charged a higher fee than poorer households served by public \nstandpipes. Installation of water meters and adjustment of the tariff system will promote water \nconservation. Socioeconomic surveys to be undertaken as part of the subproject design will \nfacilitate beneficiary involvement and enable the determination of an appropriate and affordable \nservice level. Participation of community representatives and other stakeholders will ensure that \nthe costs of the investment and O&M will be known to the communities. \n \nD.  Cost Estimates  \n \n29.  The total project cost is estimated at $36.0 million equivalent, of which $5.6 million is the \nforeign  exchange  cost  and  $30.4  million  equivalent  is  the  local  currency  cost.  The  cost \nestimates include interest and other charges during construction, as well as taxes and duties. \nThe subprojects included under the Project represent least-cost solutions. A summary of the \ncost estimates is in Table 1 and detailed cost estimates are in Appendix 6. \n \nTable 1: Cost Estimates \n($ million) \n \nForeign  Local  Total \nComponent  Percent\nExchange  Currency  Cost \nA.

The  Government  has  requested  a  loan  of  $25.0  million  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds \nresources to help finance the Project. The loan will have a 32-year term, including a grace \nperiod of 8 years, an interest charge of 1% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per \nannum thereafter. ADB will finance 69.4% of the total estimated project cost of $36.0 million. \nThe ADB loan will cover the entire foreign exchange cost ($5.6 million) and $19.4 million \n ", "9 \nequivalent of the local currency cost. The Government (including the oblast governments) will \nfinance about $11.0 million (30.6%). The financing plan is summarized in Table 2 and details \nare in Appendix 6. Supplementary Appendix I illustrates the flow of funds. The Borrower will \nenter into a subsidiary loan agreement with UCSA, the EA, under ADB loan terms with an \nadditional charge not exceeding 0.2 percentage point on the ADB interest rate. UCSA will enter \ninto  subloan  agreements  with  oblast  governments  under  the  same  terms.  The  oblast \ngovernments will bear the foreign exchange and interest risks to be defined in the subsidiary \nloan  agreement;  the  loan  repayment  will  be  fixed  in  dollars  and  repaid  at  the  prevailing \nexchange rate of the Central Bank of Uzbekistan.  \n \nTable 2: Financing Plan \n($ million) \n \nForeign  Local  Total Cost  Percent \nFund Source \nExchange  Currency \nA.

Implementation Arrangements \n \n1.  Project Management \n \n31.  The UCSA will be the EA and will have overall responsibility for project coordination, \nimplementation, and liaison with ADB and other government ministries and departments. It is \ndirectly responsible for the planning, design, and development and rehabilitation of water supply \nsystems under the Project. UCSA is headed by a director general who is assisted by two \ndeputies and 65 professional management and technical staff. Currently, UCSA is an EA for the \nADB-supported Urban Water Supply Project.5 To optimize logistical and economic efficiency, \nthe existing PMU for the Urban Water Supply Project with the additional staff, will be used as \nthe PMU for the Project. The PMU will manage and coordinate the work of the two PIUs, which \nwill be in charge of the practical implementation of the two project oblasts. Policy coordination \nand guidance for the Project will be done by an interministerial project steering committee \n(PSC). The PSC will be chaired by the Cabinet of Ministers and comprise representatives from \nUCSA,  the  Ministry  of  Finance,  Ministry  of  Economy,  Ministry  of  Agriculture  and  Water \nResources, MOH, Ministry of Public Education, State Committee for Nature Protection, State \nSanitary and Epidemiological Inspection, State Committee for Geology and Mineral Resources, \nState Committee for Architecture and Construction, State Inspectorate for Supervision of Safety \nImplementation of the Works in Industry, Mining and Communal Sectors, Kashkadarya and \nNavoi oblast governments, and other agencies concerned. The PSC will review reports to be \nprovided by the PMU, and provide guidance and instructions, as necessary, to the PMU and \nPIUs.  \n \n32.  The PMU will coordinate implementation of the Project, including procurement of goods, \nworks, and services; and the awarding of contracts, in coordination with the PIUs at the two \n                                                 \n5  ADB. 2001.

The PMU will have staff to be recruited under consulting services in the \nfields of project implementation, engineering, financial management, procurement, community \nparticipation,  and  capacity  building.  The  PIUs  will coordinate  and  manage  all  activities for \nproject implementation and will report directly to the PMU. The PIUs will coordinate preparation \nand development of the basic WSS infrastructure under the general direction of the PMU. Under \nthe guidance of the PMU, the PIUs will be responsible for all aspects of project implementation \nand coordinate closely with the technical departments concerned and agencies at the oblast \nlevel.  The  PIUs  will  initiate  and  coordinate  key  project  implementation  activities,  including \ncommunity consultations, subproject review, preparation of detailed designs, tender documents, \nconstruction supervision, monitoring and quality control, maintenance of project accounts, and \nclearance for environmental examinations. Each PIU will be supported by teams of design \ninstitutes  recruited  for  the  preparation  of  design  and  tender  documents  and  construction \nsupervision. Each PIU will have staff members for project implementation to be recruited under \nconsulting  services  in  the  fields  of  engineering,  construction  supervision,  accounting,  and \ncommunity development. The Government will ensure adequate technical staff; the skills and \nnumber of each specialist type will be agreed in consultation with ADB, as needed by the PIUs, \nto  help  with  development  and/or  rehabilitation  of  piped  water  supply  systems,  sanitation \nfacilities, and wastewater drainage facilities.  \n \n 33.  A  participatory  community-based  approach  has  been  adopted  for  project  design  and \nimplementation. A comprehensive socioeconomic survey was carried out during the initial phase \nof project preparation to determine people\u2019s needs and attitude towards participation in the \nProject in the subproject areas. The survey respondents expressed a strong commitment to pay \nfees for improved water services and provide financial contribution for improvement of private \ntoilet  facilities.  NGOs  in  the  subprojects  areas  also  attended  workshops  during  project \nformulation. To achieve a high degree of community involvement in the subproject design, \nimplementation, and O&M, the PIUs will carry out community participation activities to determine \nthe prospective beneficiaries\u2019 needs, affordability, and WTP for the services. A particular focus \nof  the  participatory  programs  will  be  on  meeting  and  prioritizing  the  needs  of  the  poor. \nAccordingly, in preparing the subprojects, once approved for funding, the PIUs will work with \nNGOs to help mobilize the community and prepare socioeconomic surveys of the community. \nProject  implementation  and  management  arrangements  are  described  in  Supplementary \nAppendix J. \n \n2.  Implementation Period \n \n34.  The Project will be implemented over a period of 5 years, from January 2006 to the end of \n2010. The implementation schedule is in Appendix 7. \n \n3.  Procurement \n \n35.  The  procurement  of  goods  and  services  under  the  ADB  loan  will  be  undertaken  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. International competitive bidding (ICB) \nprocedures will be applied to supply contracts estimated to cost the equivalent of $1 million or \nmore. Supply contracts with a value less than $1 million equivalent will follow international \nshopping  (IS)  procedures,  except  for  supply  contracts  with  a  value  less  than  $100,000 \nequivalent, which may be procured by direct purchase. In principle, ICB will be applied for civil \nworks packages costing more than $2 million. Local competitive bidding (LCB) may be used for \ncivil  works  packages  over  $2 million  where  the  EA's  justifications  are  acceptable  to  ADB. \nCurrently, each civil works contract is estimated at less than $3 million equivalent. Simple minor \ncivil works may be difficult to undertake by contractors at reasonable cost. Such works may be \n ", "11 \nundertaken by the Borrower using its own staff (force account), provided the works cost less \nthan $100,000 equivalent. In addition, force account can be employed only if the Borrower has \nadequate  construction  facilities,  including  equipment,  and  the  capacity  to  undertake  works \nexpeditiously and at reasonable cost. A list of indicative contract packaging and applicable \nprocurement procedures is in Appendix 8. \n \n4.  Consulting Services \n \n36.  The Project will require consulting services in the fields of project management, WSS \nengineering,  environmental  examination,  hydrogeology,  well  drilling,  HSE,  financing  and \naccounting, social assessment and safeguards, and institutional development and support for \nthe following: (i) development of standard water supply designs, (ii) elaboration of detailed \ndesign and construction drawings, (iii) preparation of contract packages and tender documents, \n(iv) construction supervision and evaluation of project activities, (v) support to the institutional \ndevelopment  program,  (vi)  support  to  the  activities  of  the  PMU  and  PIUs,  (vii)  training  of \naccounting  staff  in  preparing  loan  withdrawal  applications  and  supporting  documents,  and \n(viii) maintaining accurate and sufficient accounting project records. A total of 680 person-\nmonths  (50  person-months  international  and  630  person-months  domestic)  of  consulting \nservices are required for project management support. The international consultants will carry \nout  project  management,  financial,  and  institutional  strengthening  activities.  The  domestic \nconsultants\u2019 main activities will be to review technical studies, including detailed designs, and \nsupervise construction. The consultants will be recruited through a firm. The level of consulting \nservices has been discussed and agreed by ADB and the Government. The consultants will be \nengaged by UCSA in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants using quality \nand  cost  based  selection  (QCBS),  and  other  arrangements  acceptable  to  ADB  for  the \nengagement of domestic consultants. The required areas of expertise and terms of reference for \nconsulting services are outlined in Appendix 9. The detailed terms of reference for consulting \nservices are in Supplementary Appendix K. \n \n5.  Anticorruption Policy \n \n37.  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998)  was  explained  to  and  discussed  with  UCSA. \nConsistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability and transparency, ADB \nreserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, \ncollusive  or  coercive  practices  relating  to  the  Project.  To  support  these  efforts,  relevant \nprovisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the loan regulations and the bidding \ndocuments for the Project. In particular, all contracts financed by ADB in connection with the \nProject will include provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and examine the records and \naccounts of the Executing Agency and all contractors, suppliers, consultants and other service \nproviders as they relate to the Project. \n \n6.  Disbursement Arrangements \n \n38.  An imprest account will be established at a bank to be agreed by the Government and \nADB to facilitate the timely release of loan funds. The Ministry of Finance will supervise the \nimprest account operations. The initial amount to be deposited will be 6 months\u2019 estimated \nexpenditures or a ceiling not exceeding 10% of the total loan amount. ADB\u2019s statement of \nexpenditure (SOE) procedure will be used to reimburse eligible expenditures and to liquidate \nadvances provided to the imprest account. The individual payments that may be reimbursed or \nliquidated under the SOE procedure will not exceed $50,000 equivalent. The imprest account \nand  SOE  procedure  will  be  established  and  maintained  in  accordance  with  The  Loan \n ", "12 \nDisbursement  Handbook,  dated  January  2001  and  detailed  arrangements  between  the \nGovernment and ADB. \n \n7.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n \n39.  The Government through the PMU will (i) maintain separate accounts for the Project, and \n(ii)  have  such  accounts  and  related  financial  statements  audited  annually  by  independent \nauditors acceptable to ADB in accordance with the provisions of the Loan Agreement and as \nspecified in ADB\u2019s Financial Reporting and Auditing of Projects Financed by the Bank. The \nauditors should have qualifications, experience, and terms of reference acceptable to ADB. The \nimprest account and SOE records will also be audited as part of the annual audit. A separate \naudit opinion on the use of the imprest account and SOE will be submitted. The Government will \nsubmit to ADB certified copies (in English) of such audited accounts and financial statements, \nand the related reports of auditors, within 6 months after the close of each financial year. For the \npurpose  of  complying  with  the  requirements  for  annual  audited  financial  statements,  the \nproceeds of this loan may be used to finance expenditure for private sector auditors and \ntranslations of auditors\u2019 reports into English. UCSA will submit consolidated quarterly progress \nreports to ADB (in English) on all aspects of project implementation, including resettlement. The \nreports will include details on overall implementation progress, problems encountered during the \nreporting period, measures taken or proposed to be taken to remedy these problems, and the \nproposed program of activities for the following quarter. Within 3 months of project completion, \nUCSA will prepare and submit to ADB, in a format acceptable to ADB, a project completion \nreport on the utilization and impact of the loan; performance of the Project; economic and social \nbenefits generated; and details about implementation, costs, resettlement, and other information \nrequested by ADB. \n \n8.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n \n40.  The  PMU  will  implement  a  project  performance  monitoring  system  (PPMS)  for  each \nsubproject to evaluate the delivery of the planned facilities and the subproject benefits accrued. \nA  framework  and  indicative  indicators  have  been  prepared  and  a  PPMS  outline  is  in \nSupplementary Appendix L. The PMU, with the assistance of the consultants, will develop \ncomprehensive PPMS procedures and plans within 6 months after loan effectiveness. The \nPPMS  activities,  including  the  establishment  of  benchmarks,  collection  of  information, \nmonitoring of benefits, and evaluation of social impact, will be undertaken by local governments. \nData  collection  will  be  carried  out  prior  to  physical  implementation  of  each  subproject,  in \nconjunction  with  socioeconomic  surveys.  It  will  then  continue  on  a  regular  basis  during \nimplementation and for 3 months after physical completion. The results will be incorporated into \nthe project progress and completion reports. \n \n9.  Project Review \n \n41.  The Project will require close monitoring and review in particular to ensure decentralized \ninstitution  building  and  sustainable  O&M.  The  Project  will  be  reviewed  twice  a  year.  A \ncomprehensive review of the implementation arrangements, including the role of the UCSA and \nDWCUs as well as project start-up experience, will be undertaken by the Government and ADB \n1 year after loan effectiveness. A comprehensive midterm review will be undertaken 3 years \nafter loan effectiveness, and will focus on the impact on poverty reduction, implementation \narrangements,  resettlement,  community  involvement,  physical  implementation,  design  and \ntechnology, O&M and cost recovery arrangements, institutional aspects (including training), \n ", "13 \nhealth education, and the role of women. The reviews will also assess the Project\u2019s progress \nand achievements against its objectives, identify any problems, and discuss possible solutions.  \n \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n \nA.  Environmental Impacts and Benefits \n \n42.  Overall, the Project is environmentally beneficial. Initial environmental examinations (IEEs) \nwere  carried  out  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Environmental  Policy  (2002),  Environmental \nAssessment  Guidelines  (2003),  and  national  guidelines.6  A  summary  initial  environmental \nexamination (SIEE) is in Appendix 10. The physical subprojects component\u2014involving simple, \nappropriate,  low-cost  technology\u2014does  not  pose  any  significant  adverse  environmental \nconsequences. The provision of safe drinking water and proper sanitation facilities is expected \nto have a significant positive impact on improvement of the environment. Water resources, \nparticularly groundwater, are scarce throughout the country. The use of centralized water supply \nfrom centralized water resources systems is usually the most cost-effective and economic \nsolution.  When  available,  local  fresh  groundwater  resources  are  developed  to  feed \ndecentralized waters supply systems, provided the water quality meets the required standards \nand the annual replenishment allows sustainable development. The quality of water resources \nselected for development has been reviewed and fit the norms. The Government\u2019s environment \nsector policies and the capacity of the Government agencies involved are adequate. The IEE \nreports  and  the  SIEE  have  concluded  that  none  of  the  subprojects  are  environmentally \nsensitive.  Environmental  concerns,  for  which  appropriate  safeguards  will  be  built  into  the \nsubproject  designs,  include:  (i)  protection  of  environmentally  sensitive  areas  around  water \nsources, (ii) provision for proper collection and disposal of wastewater, (iii) controlled long-term \nextraction from groundwater sources, (iv) safeguarding the interests of downstream users of \nsurface  sources,  (v)  protection  measures  for  historical  monuments  and  natural  sites  of \necological importance, and (vi) avoiding encroachment on household perimeters and cultivated \nlands. The core subprojects\u2019 IEEs are in Supplementary Appendix M and the environmental \nassessment and review framework (EARF) is in Supplementary Appendix N. \n \nB.  Social Safeguards \n \n1.  Poverty Reduction and Social Benefits \n \n43.  A poverty and social analysis was undertaken for the Project as a whole\u2014covering the \n12 subprojects\u2014to  assess  the  demand,  need,  capacity,  WTP  and  affordability,  gender, \ncommunity participation, and other risks. Although it is a sector project, no poverty and social \nassessment is required for additional subprojects. The Project will benefit about 250,000 people, \nof which more than 30% are considered poor, in the two project oblasts. \n \n44.  The Project is expected to: (i) improve the quantity and quality of water available, which \nwill  lead  to  an  improved  quality  of  life;  and  (ii)  empower  vulnerable  and  disenfranchised \ncommunities through formation of DWCUs. Access to potable water and increased sanitation \nawareness among the rural population and children will improve health and sanitation. Improved \nhealth conditions will reduce the mortality rate and incidence of waterborne diseases. The \nProject\u2019s HSE program stresses the need to adopt proper sanitary practices. This will lead to \nenvironmental improvements, added health benefits, and increased productivity\u2014resulting in \ndirect economic benefits. To ensure equitable access to safe and reliable water supply for poor \n                                                 \n6  RCM 118.0027714.24-93 \u201cInstruction on the procedure for environmental impact assessment\u201d. \n ", "14 \nrural  communities,  monitoring  systems  will  be  developed  at  the  community  and  project \nadministration levels. The UCSA will monitor the socioeconomic implications of the Project \nthrough all the implementation phases as part of the PPMS. A summary of the poverty reduction \nand social development strategy is in Appendix 11. \n \n2.  Involuntary Resettlement \n \n45.  Specific land requirements have not been fully identified. An initial involuntary resettlement \nscreening shows that the Project may require a total of 85\u201390 hectares (ha) of land for the \nlocation of small groundwater pumping stations and, in some cases, small storage tanks. These \nwill be outside village areas in unused land and will not require the displacement of people. \nPipelines are planned to be constructed along existing roads. Alternative design options will be \ncompared  at  the  design  stage  to  minimize  temporary  or  permanent  encroachment  on \nagricultural  land.  All  land  in  Uzbekistan  is  state-owned  but  there  are  both  collective  and \nindividual  land  use  rights.  Use  of  land  is  regulated  by  the  state  through  oblast  and  local \nadministrations.  \n \n46.  Lands needed for the construction of new facilities will be contributed by the state and will \nremain state property. The Government will screen each subproject before the award of the civil \nworks contracts to determine whether there are any involuntary resettlement effects that would \nrequire compensation and other assistance under ADB's Policy on Involuntary Resettlement. To \nensure that ADB policies on involuntary resettlement will be applied and impacted families will \nbe  compensated,  a  resettlement  framework  (RF)  has  been  prepared  which  sets  out  the: \n(i) resettlement  policy,  (ii)  compensation  standards  and  entitlements,  and  (iii)  procedural \nguidelines to be complied with for subprojects where people are adversely affected by land \nacquisition or project construction. The RF was prepared and endorsed by UCSA, and copies \nhave been disclosed to the subproject areas. The RF has been uploaded to the ADB website. \nSubsequently, each subproject with resettlement impacts will be required to prepare and submit \na resettlement plan (RP) to ADB for approval, prior to commencement of land acquisition and \ncivil works. Resettlement implementation will be monitored by UCSA and an independent body. \nThe  summary  RF  is  in  Appendix  12,  RPs  for  the  core  subprojects  are  in  Supplementary \nAppendix O, and the detailed RF is in Supplementary Appendix P. \n \n3.  Ethnic Minorities \n \n47.  The poverty and social assessment has shown that there are no ethnic minority issues in \nthe four core subprojects. Ethnic minorities (i.e., Tajiks, Kazakhs, and Karakalpaks) are present \nin the additional subproject areas of Kitab, Shakhrisabz, Kanimeh, and Novbahor districts. An \nethnic minorities development framework (EMDF) was developed to guide the preparation of \nnon-core subprojects, which have positive and adverse impacts on ethnic minorities. The EMDF \nfor additional subprojects is in Supplementary Appendix Q. Ethnic minorities will be represented \nin the DWCUs and will benefit equally from the Project. Monitoring of the Project\u2019s impact on \nethnic minorities has been incorporated in the PPMS. Specific measures to address the needs \nof ethnic minorities have been incorporated in the selection of the subprojects. \n \n4.  Gender Issues \n \n48.  Provision of adequate-quality potable water will have a direct positive impact on women, \nand will reduce women\u2019s labor inputs and promote more effective time budgeting. Through the \nProject, poor women-headed households will have equal access to potable water. Children will \nhave more  time for schoolwork and welfare activities. Specific steps to enhance women\u2019s \n ", "15 \nparticipation in the Project include: (i) identifying women\u2019s groups in the community; (ii) training \nwomen\u2019s community groups to participate in project-related activities such as health education \nand  gender  issues;  (iii)  training  women\u2019s  organizations,  including  those  representing  poor \nwomen, in the decision-making process (including planning of WSS facilities); and (iv) providing \nemployment opportunities for women in local government and DWCU activities. A gender action \nplan is in Supplementary Appendix R.  \n \nC.  Institutional Benefits  \n \n1.  Project Benefits and Impacts \n \n49.  The Project will benefit about 250,000 people, of which more than 30% are considered \npoor, in the two project oblasts through provision of improved access to safe and reliable water \nsupply and better sanitation facilities. Technical, economic, and financial analyses confirm that \nthe least-cost, long-term solutions involve development and/or rehabilitation of water sources \nand water supply systems. This approach will bring social and economic benefits, including \npoverty  reduction,  financial  sustainability  at  affordable  levels  for  project  beneficiaries,  and \npositive environmental impacts. Institutional solutions and community participation in the design \nand implementation of the subprojects will enhance the efficiency and sustainability of the sector \nprogram and subprojects.  \n \n2.  Institutional Strengthening \n \n50.  The UCSA is currently implementing another ADB-assisted water supply project, and has \nadequate capacity and experience to implement the Project. However, there is a need for \ninstitutional  strengthening  at  local  government  levels,  especially:  (i)  planning  and  financial \nmanagement systems; and (ii) community participation structures and processes, and capability \nto handle resettlement issues, including the design and implementation of resettlement plans. \nInstitutional  strengthening  is  directly  incorporated  in  the  Project  through  the  institutional \ndevelopment component, including a capacity-building program, HSE program, and consulting \nservices for project management support. \n \nD.  Economic and Financial Aspects \n \n1.  Economic Aspects \n \n51.  The economic analysis covers both the Project as a whole, and the individual subprojects \n(Appendix 13). For the Project as a whole, the analysis covers the economic rationale for \ngovernment  intervention,  and  the  goals  and  general  design  of  the  investment  plan.  The \neconomic rationale is sound, based on social responsibility to provide basic social services and \ncontrolling natural monopoly (water supply). The goals of the investment plan are to meet \ntargets for rural water supply development and control of the spread of waterborne disease, \nespecially  in  hard-to-reach  areas.  The  targets  are  clearly  defined,  legally  established,  and \nconsistent with government goals for sustainable development in rural water supply, as defined \nin the National Water Supply Development Program (NWSDP), 2000\u20132010. The plan to meet \ntargets is based on centralized water supply systems designed using least-cost solutions based \non  type  and  availability  of  water  resources  and  variations  in  scope,  design  technologies, \nlocation,  and  planning  horizon.  Other  project  goals  consistent  with  NWSDP  include  cost \nrecovery and sustainability tariffs, conservation and economic use of water, and improved \ndecentralization.  Economic  cost-benefit  analysis  for  the  individual  subprojects  was  also \n ", "16 \nundertaken to strengthen the economic justification. The economic internal rate of return for the \nfour representative subprojects range between 23% and 36%. \n \n2.  Financial Aspects \n \n52.  Financial evaluation of the four representative core subprojects was undertaken in real \nterms using constant April 2005 prices. The project cost estimates and financial projections in \nnominal terms after tax were converted to real terms by adjusting for foreign and domestic \ninflation and currency fluctuation. The financial internal rate of return (FIRR) for each subproject \nis  more  than  the  weighted  average  cost  of  capital,  computed  on  an  after-tax  basis.  The \nsubprojects are considered both financially viable and sustainable. The FIRRs for the four core \nsubprojects range between 6.6% and 7.9%, averaging 7.2%. This compares favorably with the \nweighted average cost of capital of 4.5%. Sensitivity and risk analyses indicate that the FIRR is \nrobust under adverse conditions. Projected tariffs are within the accepted limit, so they are \naffordable to low-income group households. \n \n53.  Financial projections were prepared for each of the subproject entities in accordance with \nADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  the  Financial  Governance  and  Management  of  Investment  Projects \nFinanced by ADB (2002) and ADB\u2019s Framework for the Economic and Financial Appraisal of \nUrban Development Sector Projects (1994) to assess the financial viability and sustainability of \neach subproject (Appendix 14). Projected financial statements indicate that financial revenues \nwill be sufficient to cover O&M costs from the first year of operation and a substantial portion of \ndepreciation  from  years  1\u20134.  By  year  5,  the subprojects  will  have achieved  financial self-\nsufficiency to attain full cost recovery during the remaining repayment period. Details of the \nfinancial analysis for the four core subprojects are presented in Supplementary Appendix S. \n \n3.  Affordability Analysis and Project Sustainability \n \n54.  The water supply subprojects will be community driven from the initial stage of formulation \nand  construction,  and  DWCUs  will  participate  in  O&M  of  the  schemes  as  self-supporting \nagencies to the extent possible. Based on the survey undertaken, the rural population appears \nwilling to increase water services payments. Expressed as a percentage of average household \nincome of the low-income group, the tariffs are expected to vary between 2.3% and 5.7% for \nlow-income households in Kashkadarya (4.0% average), and between 1.9% and 7.5% in Navoi \n(4.7% average). These values are within the accepted standards from 3% to 5%. Since it is \nlikely that poorer households will collect water from public standpipes at a fixed monthly rate, \nthe cost will be much less than for households with in-house connections. The subproject \nrevenues are expected to cover O&M costs and depreciation to ensure project sustainability.  \n \nE.  Project Risks \n \n55.  Three  possible  risks  have  been  identified.  First,  the  possibility  of  delays  in  project \nimplementation caused by weak institutional capability to implement, operate, and maintain \nwater supply systems has been addressed through clear delineation of agency responsibilities \nand inclusion of coordination mechanisms. Considerable preparatory work has been undertaken \nin the potential subproject communities regarding the present status of water supply facilities, \nand an initial assessment of required development has been carried out. Substantial support will \nalso  be  provided  for  capacity  building  through  training  programs  and  consulting  services. \nSecond, the potential for delays in project implementation caused by lack of local counterpart \nfunds has been addressed by the active participation of local administrations, which meet some \nconstruction supervision and all land requirements. Measures to reduce possible delays have \n ", "17 \nbeen discussed with the Government. Third, limited financial capability to meet the incremental \nO&M of the expanded water supply systems has been dealt with by including the institutional \ndevelopment program, which should strengthen the capacity to undertake the O&M of the \nexpanded water supply systems. The Project will be closely monitored, with two reviews a year \nthroughout implementation. \n \nV.  ASSURANCES \n \nA.  Specific Assurances \n \n56.  In  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  and  UCSA  have  given  the \nfollowing assurances, which will be incorporated in the Loan and Project Agreements: \n \n(i)  The Government, with the assistance of the oblast governments, will cause the \ncreation of DWCUs to serve villages participating in the Project. The DWCUs will \n(a) ensure that each community benefiting from the Project becomes involved in \nthe O&M of the Project facilities, and (b) assist in the collection of water bills. \n(ii)  The Government will cause the oblast governments to conduct annual reviews of \nthe level and structure of water tariffs in order to ensure that these tariffs are \neconomically justified and cover all the O&M costs, taking into account water \nconsumption  volumes  and  repair  costs.  The  results  of  such  reviews  will  be \nsubmitted to ADB through UCSA within 3 months after their completion. \n(iii)  The Government will cause the oblast governments, supported by the DWCUs \nconcerned,  to  (a)  take  appropriate  measures  for  the  proper  collection  of \noutstanding  water  bills,  and  (b)  protect  their  water  resources  and  facilities \nthrough vigorous prosecution for violations such as water meter tampering and \nwater theft. \n(iv)  The Government, through UCSA and the oblast governments, will ensure that (a) \nrelevant NGOs and community-based organizations are involved in subproject \nplanning, design, construction, and O&M, as well as in actively helping with the \ncapacity building, health, and hygiene components of the Project; (b) women\u2019s \ncommunity  groups  participate  in  all  relevant  Project-related  decision-making \nactivities;  and  (c)  adequate  opportunities  for  the  employment  of  women  in \nDWCU-related activities under the Project are made available.  \n(v)  The Government, through UCSA, will ensure that the screening, selection and \nappraisal of subprojects are based on the criteria outlined in the schedule to the \nProject  Agreement.  The  Government  will  cause  UCSA  to  obtain  the  prior \napproval of ADB for any subproject. \n(vi)  The Government, through UCSA, will ensure that with regard to all non-core \nsubprojects (a) initial IEEs are prepared; (b) each IEE meets the requirements of \nthe  Government\u2019s  environmental  assessment  and  review  process,  ADB\u2019s \nEnvironment Policy (2002), the EARF prepared for the Project, and the model \nIEEs  developed  for  the  core  subprojects;  (c)  each  IEE  indicates  that  the \nsubprojects  will  not  result  in  significant  long  term  negative  environmental \nimpacts;  and  (d)  each  IEE  includes  a  costed  subproject  environmental \nmanagement plan (EMP) and defined mitigation measures in line with local laws \nand ADB\u2019s Environment Policy that will be implemented to mitigate environment \n ", "18 \nimpacts during construction and operation.  The progress of the EMPs will be \nreported to ADB as part of project monitoring and review. \n(vii)  The Government will cause UCSA to implement the Project in accordance with \nthe Project\u2019s RF dated August 2005 and the four RPs prepared for the four core \nsubprojects,  and  the  eight  RPs  to  be  prepared  for  the  remaining  eight \nsubprojects. UCSA, through the subloan agreements with oblast governments, \nwill ensure that (a) all land and rights-of-way required for the Project are made \navailable by the oblast governments in a timely manner, in accordance with all \napplicable laws and regulations of the Borrower, and ADB\u2019s Policy on Involuntary \nResettlement  (1995);  and  (b)  counterpart  funds  for  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement activities are provided in a timely manner, with UCSA meeting any \nobligations in excess of budgeted estimates. UCSA will also ensure that (a) each \nindividual RP is submitted to ADB for approval prior to any land being acquired or \npeople being affected under the relevant RP; (b) adequate staff and resources \nare committed to supervising and monitoring the implementation of the RPs and \nproviding quarterly reports on such implementation to ADB; (c) an independent \nagency  acceptable  to  ADB  is  engaged  by  UCSA  to  monitor  and  evaluate \nresettlement, and to submit reports to ADB semi-annually; and (d) civil works \ncontractor specifications include requirements to comply with the RPs. \n(viii)  The Government will cause UCSA to (a) update the RPs prepared for the four \ncore subprojects, disclose them through the oblast governments to all affected \npersons, and resubmit them to ADB for concurrence; and (b) ensure that the RPs \nprepared  for  the  eight  non-core  subprojects  are  based  on  the  RF  and  final \ndesign, and are submitted to ADB for approval.   \n(ix)  In the event of any significant material change in Project scope, UCSA will advise \nADB of such change and submit an updated RF to ADB for its approval. With \nrespect to any updated RPs, UCSA will cause the relevant oblast government to \ndisclose such updated RPs to affected persons prior to ADB approval. \n(x)  The Government will cause UCSA to ensure that (a) the EMDF prepared for the \nProject and ethnic minorities development plans (EMDPs) are implemented in \naccordance  with  their  terms;  and  (b)  EMDPs  are  prepared  for  relevant \nsubprojects if ethnic minority impacts are considered significant in accordance \nwith the EMDF and ADB\u2019s Policy on Indigenous Peoples (1998). \n(xi)  If EMDPs are required, the Government will cause UCSA, through the subloan \nagreements with the oblast governments, to ensure that (a) the EMDPs are \ndisclosed to affected persons; (b) ethnic minorities in Project areas are consulted \nand  provided  with  an opportunity  to  participate  in  the  implementation  of  the \nEMDPs; (c) sufficient budget for implementation and monitoring of each EMDP is \nmade available in a timely manner, and any obligations in excess of the EMDP \nbudget  estimates  are  met;  (d)  any  significant  changes  to  the  EMDPs  are \nsubmitted to ADB for approval; (e) an independent agency acceptable to ADB is \nengaged  by  UCSA  to  carry  out  regular  monitoring  and  evaluation  of  the \nimplementation of the EMDPs and to report annually to ADB; and (f) the targeted \nethnic minorities will benefit from the Project and will be at least as well off as \nthey would have been in the absence of the Project. \n(xii)  To address gender impacts and promote women\u2019s active involvement in the \nProject, the Government will cause UCSA, through the PMU, to be responsible \nfor implementing and monitoring the gender action plan prepared for the Project. \n ", "19 \nIn particular, UCSA will ensure women are involved in training, the HSE program, \nand the membership of the DWCUs. \n(xiii)  The  Government,  through  UCSA,  will  ensure  that  the  implementation  of  the \nProject, the operation of the Project facilities, and the benefits derived from the \nProject are monitored and evaluated on an annual basis by the PMU. Within 6 \nmonths of the loan becoming effective, the Government will cause the project \nperformance monitoring system (PPMS) to be refined by UCSA in a manner \nsatisfactory to ADB so as to include the use of all relevant financial and technical \nmonitoring indicators and information. \n(xiv)  One year after the loan becomes effective, the Government will conduct a review \nof  the  implementation  arrangements,  including  the  role  of  UCSA  and  the \nDWCUs, as well as Project start-up experience, and will invite ADB to participate \nin  the  review.  The  Government  will  conduct  similar  comprehensive  reviews \nduring the second and fourth years of Project implementation, and will invite ADB \nto participate in these reviews as well. \n \nB  Condition for Loan Effectiveness \n \n57.  The Government will enter into a subsidiary loan agreement with UCSA under terms and \nconditions satisfactory to ADB. \n \nVI.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n58.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and,  acting  in  the  absence  of  the  President,  under  the \nprovisions of Article 35.1 of the Articles of Agreement of ADB, I recommend that the Board \napprove the loan in various currencies equivalent to Special Drawing Rights 17,291,000 to the \nRepublic of Uzbekistan for the Kashkadarya and Navoi Rural Water Supply and Sanitation \nSector Project, from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources with an interest charge at the rate of 1% \nper  annum  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5%  per  annum  thereafter;  a  term  of  32  years, \nincluding a grace period of 8 years; and such other terms and conditions as are substantially in \naccordance with those set forth in the draft Loan and Project Agreements presented to the \nBoard. \n \n         \nJoseph Eichenberger  \nVice President  \n \n \n16 November 2005\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "20  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance  Data  Assumptions \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Sources/Reporting  and Risks \nMechanisms \nImpact      Assumptions \n       \nImproved living standards  By 2010, in the project  \u2022 Water quality in service  \u2022 Improved quality of water \nand public health in rural  area:  systems monitored and  supply is sustained by rural \nareas of Kashkadarya and    reported by the MOH  water supply agencies \nNavoi oblasts (provinces)   \u2022 Increase public     \n  satisfaction with water  \u2022 Annual socioeconomic  \u2022 Kashkadarya and Navoi \nsupply quality from  surveys undertaken as part  oblast administrations remain \ncurrent 40% (100,000  of a performance  committed to implement the \npeople) to 80%  management system  Project \n(200,000 people).     \n  \u2022 Annual public health  \u2022 HSE program effectively \n\u2022 Reduce incidence of  statistics of MOH  implemented on a constant \nwaterborne diseases    and sustainable basis \nfrom current 30%     \n(75,000 people) to 10%  Risks  \n(25,000 people).   \n  \u2022 Lack of government and local \n\u2022 Reduce medical costs  community commitment to the \nfor treatment of  Project \nwaterborne disease   \nfrom current average   \u2022 Institutional development \n$10 per year, by 40% to  program and public \n$6 per person per year.  participation not implemented \n   \n\u2022 Reduce loss of working \ndays due to waterborne \ndiseases from current \naverage 20 days, by \n50% to 10 days per \nperson per year.  \nOutcome      Assumptions \n       \nImproved access to basic  \u2022 Number of rural  \u2022 Operational and financial  \u2022 Adequate government \nwater supply and  settlements with water  reports of UCSA   cofinancing of water supply \nsanitation facilities in the  supply systems    infrastructure upgrade \nproject areas  commissioned  \u2022 Report of external auditors   \n  (54 villages in 2008,  and regulators  \u2022 Adequate and timely \n108 in 2009, and    feasibility study \n170 in 2010)  \u2022 Management information   \n  system of the oblast water  Risks \n\u2022 At least one school with  supply agencies   \nupgraded water supply    \u2022 Budget restrictions affecting \nand sanitation in each  \u2022 Public health reports of  implementation of the \nvillage  MOH  institutional program \n(54 villages in 2008,     \n108 in 2009, and  \u2022 Water quality in service  \u2022 Adjustments in tariffs are not \n170 in 2010)  systems monitored and  accepted by customers \n  reported by MOH    \n    \u2022 Tariff policy changes are \n\u2022 Socioeconomic surveys  halted \n   \n\u2022 ADB review missions  \u2022 Unsubstantiated inflation of \n  water tariffs \n \n\u2022 Lack of community \nparticipation  ", "          Appendix 1       21       \nDesign  Performance  Data  Assumptions \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Sources/Reporting  and Risks \nMechanisms \nOutputs      Assumptions \n       \n1.

The Basis of the Policy \n \n1.  Uzbekistan\u2019s water supply and sanitation policy (the Policy), particularly as it relates to \nthe rural sector, is underpinned by three legal instruments: (i) the national 10-year water supply \ndevelopment scheme approved by the Cabinet of Ministers in 1999, (ii) the resolution of the \nCabinet of Ministers approved in 2003 (RCM No. 405), and (iii) the latest annual investment \nprogram approved by the Cabinet of Ministers. \n \n2.  The Government of Uzbekistan places a high priority on the sustainable development of \nrural settlements as a precondition for fostering countrywide development. The Government \nprefers an integrated rural development policy, which targets the overall sustainability of rural \nsettlements and sets the following main objectives: (i) improvement of environmental conditions, \n(ii) improvement of rural incomes, (iii) provision of adequate housing, (iv) availability of social \nand health services, and (v) coverage of people\u2019s needs in drinking water and sanitation.  \n \n3.  Uzbekistan  is  a  signatory  to  Agenda  21.  As  such,  it  has  adopted  the  principle  of \n\u201crationalization  of  utilization  of  land,  water  and  other  natural  resources  to  conserve  their \nreserves for forthcoming generations\u201d as one of its major goals for sustainable development. \nFurther, recognizing the significant disparities in the levels of development between urban \ncenters  and  rural  villages,  the  Government\u2019s  support  for  the  transition  to  sustainable \ndevelopment prioritizes: (i) the needs of rural settlements, (ii) redressing regional disparities, \nand (iii) addressing the needs of the poorer segment of the population based on the overall \nprinciple  that  sustainable  development  of  rural  settlements  determines  the  sustainability  of \ncountrywide development.  \n \n4.  The Policy emphasizes the adoption of cost-effective construction technologies and \nimprovement  of  management  procedures  oriented  towards  economic  use  of  water  and \nreduction of water wastage through: (i) installation of water meters; (ii) elimination of leakages, \nillegal connections, and other water losses; (iii) further reduction of specific rates of water \ndemand; and (iv) improvement of water tariff collection performance.  \n \n5.  The Government has prepared and started a number of national programs targeted at \ncontributing to sustainable overall development of rural settlements, funded by the national \nbudget, as well as loans and grants from external sources. In the rural sanitation subsector, the \nfocus of government efforts has been on upgrading basic sanitation services and fostering \nschool sanitation and hygiene through a series of integrated projects. Nine interregional water \nsupply systems are targeted for completion by 2010. These constitute the least-cost solution for \nthe supply of large areas, in comparison with the main alternative, which is desalination. \n \n6.  Recognizing the urgency of these tasks, the Republic of Uzbekistan has taken steps to \ndevelop a comprehensive policy covering its water supply and sanitation (WSS) sector. The key \nobjectives of the Policy are to: (i) improve water sector services through a national water supply \ndevelopment plan; (ii) attain financial sustainability through an effective tariff system and cost \nrecovery; (iii) plan adequate investments with domestic and external funding; (iv) achieve further \ndecentralization of WSS services; (v) encourage private sector participation and public-private \npartnerships in the sector; (vi) implement hygiene and sanitation education programs in schools; \n(vii) achieve improved livelihood conditions, particularly for the benefit of women in rural areas; \n(viii)  ensure  environmental  compliance  by  encouraging  conservative  development  of  water \nresources, economic use of water, consistent water quality control, and sound management of ", "24  Appendix 2 \nwastewater;  and  (ix)  improve  further  operational  strategies  by  strengthening  the  sector \ninstitutional setup and interagency collaboration, and by promoting adequate capacity building. \n \n7.  Under the Policy, the Government has committed to a 10-year program (2000\u20132010) to \nimprove water supply to rural communities, many of which currently have inadequate or no \nwater supply. This program, developed in 1999 and modified in 2003, envisions the construction \nof water supply systems and improvement of the service level of drinking water supply with the \naim of benefiting up to 85% of Uzbekistan\u2019s rural population. Although the program has had a \nslow start, it is making good progress and necessary institutional arrangements have been set \nin place (as of September 2005).  \n \nB.  Institutional Framework \n \n8.  Central  level.  The  Uzbekistan  Communal  Services  Agency  (UCSA),1  under  the \nsupervision of the Cabinet of Ministers, has the overall task of improving national water supply \nservices and the main goal of setting up financially viable local water supply services. UCSA\u2019s \nscope covers tasks ranging from regulatory to commercial, including: (i) provision of regulatory \nadvice to support reforms in the communal services sector; (ii) monitoring compliance with \nsector policies by local authorities and commercial entities; and (iii) attracting foreign investment \nto the sector, including the establishment of joint ventures. \n \n9.  Provincial level. Uzbekistan\u2019s 11 oblast vodokanals act as UCSA\u2019s executive arm for \nwater supply and sewerage within the oblasts. Each oblast vodokanal coordinates the activities \nof  urban  and  rayon  vodokanals.  Some  specific  tasks  of  the  oblast  vodokanals  are  to: \n(i) determine annually the limits of water production for the various service areas under the \ncompetence of urban and rayon vodokanals, (ii) calculate tariffs for all categories, and (iii) keep \nstatistical information received from rayon vodokanals.  \n \n10.  Rayon level. The rayon vodokanals are subordinate to the oblast vodokanals and have \nresponsibility for water distribution primarily to rayon centers and, in some cases, to neighboring \nvillages. \n \n11.  Water resources management in Uzbekistan falls under the following main agencies: \n(i) Ministry of Agriculture and Water Resources, responsible for all surface water use; (ii) State \nCommittee  on  Geology  and  Mineral  Resources,  responsible  for  groundwater  investigation, \nmanagement, monitoring, and protection; and (iii) State Inspectorate for Regulating the Use of \nWater in Industry and Mining, responsible for thermal and mineral water. In addition, the State \nCommittee for Nature Protection monitors liquid effluents and exerts control of pollution of \nnatural water resources. \n \nC.  Legal Basis of the Policy \n \n12.  The Government initiated institutional changes as early as 1991, adopting a gradualist \napproach  in  implementing  reforms,  thus  avoiding  abrupt  changes  while  maintaining  strong \ncentralized  control  and  leadership.  Significant  early  changes  adopted  by  the  Government \nincluded: (i) prioritizing improvement of infrastructure services in communal and rural areas, and \n                                                 \n1  See (i) Resolution of the Cabinet of Ministers (RCM) No. 429 of 2 November 2000 on the Establishment of a \nSpecial Commission on Reorganizing the System of Communal Services; (ii) Presidential Decree No. 2791 of \n19 December 2000 on Further Reforms in the Management System of Communal Services; and (iii) RCM No. 493 \nof 21 December 2000, on Improving the Organization of the Communal Services System. ", "     Appendix 2  25 \n(ii) abolishing agencies too rigidly associated with a command economy. Laws promulgated \nsince 1991 have facilitated the transition to a market economy2 and encouraged foreign direct \ninvestment.3 \n \n13.  The Policy is based on the following legal documents: (i) Law on Water and Water Use, \n1993,4 which establishes the principles of allocation of water resources, the right to withdrawal \nof groundwater resources, and provides for protection and conservation of water; (ii) Resolution \nof the Cabinet of Ministers (RCM) No. 385 of 3 August 1993 on Transitional Rules for Limitation \nof Water Use, which addressed the problem of increasing water shortages by, among other \nthings, rendering compulsory the issuing of permits for extraction of more than 100 cubic meters \n(m3) of water per day; (iii) RCM No. 461 of 3 November 1998 on Approval of the Concept of \nStrengthening Economic Reforms in the Communal Services Sector; (iv) RCM No. 405,5 which \n(a) includes instructions for providing all rural settlements with drinking water from 2003 to 2010, \nand developing additional water resources, and (b) encourages support for private initiatives \nand the participation of local organizations and communities in the construction of water supply \nsystems.  \n \n14.  The Updated Water Supply Development Scheme for the Republic of Uzbekistan based \non the New Regulatory Principles and Norms up to the Year 2010 was finalized in 1999.6 The \nscheme provides for the implementation of a national drinking water supply program in both \nurban and rural areas using the time horizon of 2010. It includes: (i) reviews of the existing \nwater supply situation, (ii) assessments of unaccounted for water and wastage, (iii) review of \ndesign criteria and proposals for reduction of unit water consumption and control of water \nwastage,  (iv)  population  and  water  demand  projections,  (v)  comparison  of  demand  and \nresources, (vi) analysis of transmission mains, (vii) main directions for implementation of the \nwater supply scheme, (viii) recommendations for innovative technologies, (ix) estimate of the \nfinancial needs of the scheme, and (x) review of the existing legal framework. \n \n15.  A major step towards reform in the water supply sector was the reorganization in 2000 of \nthe communal services system, which led to the dismantling of the Ministry of Communal \nServices and the transfer of responsibility for water supply to the oblast administrations, Council \nof Ministers of the Republic of Karakalpakhstan, Tashkent city administration, and the newly \ncreated UCSA. \n \n \n \n                                                 \n2  Law on Denationalization and Privatization, November 1991, amended 7 May 1994 and 23 September 1994; \nPresidential Decree of January 1994 to Promote Economic Reform Process; and Presidential Decree of 15 March \n1994 on Priority Directions of Further Development of Denationalization and Privatization in the Republic of \nUzbekistan. \n3  Law on Foreign Investments, 1994; Law No. 609-I of 30 April 1998 on Foreign Investments; Law No. 611-I of \n30 April 1998, on Guarantee and Measures for Protection of Foreign Investors Rights; Presidential Decree No. 477 \nof 18 November 1998 on Measures to Encourage the Attraction of Foreign Capital in the Course of Privatization of \nState Property. \n4   Law No. 837-XII of 6 May 1993 on Water and Water Use.  \n5  RCM No. 405 of 17 September 2003 on Additional Measures for the Improvement of the Supply of Rural \nSettlements with Drinking Water and Natural Gas. \n6  The Uzbekkommunalloiha Design Institute was the principal author of the scheme. ", "26  Appendix 3 \n  SUMMARY OF SECTOR INVESTMENT PLAN \n \nA.  Medium- to Long-Term Development Strategy \n \n1.  The main goals of Uzbekistan\u2019s medium- to long-term economic policy are to ensure \nsteady, long-term growth as the basis of improving living standards. Core objectives targeted by \nthe  Government\u2019s  development  strategy  for  the  medium-term  development  plan  until  2010 \ninclude: (i) undertaking social measures aimed at reducing the poverty level, (ii) creating new \njob opportunities, and (iii) increasing household income.  \n \n2.  A  number  of  major  programs  have  been  completed  or  are  currently  under \nimplementation, including the state housing support program, health reform program, national \npersonnel training program, water supply and sanitation program, natural gas supply program, \nstate  family  protection  program,  and  other  programs.  In  the  public  utilities  sector,  the \nGovernment has recognized the most acute social problem as the lack of adequate supply of \nsafe water, particularly in rural areas. This situation is exacerbated by the ecological problems \nof the Aral Sea, and the pollution and depletion of surface and groundwater resources.  \n \n3.  Since  1991,  the  Government  has  pursued  expansion  of  Uzbekistan\u2019s  piped  water \nsupply.  In  implementing  its  water  supply  program,  the  Government  has  placed  particular \nemphasis on the development of long distance, interregional transmission mains, carrying water \nfrom its source to urban and rural settlements where no fresh water is available.  \n \n4.  The  Government  establishes  3-year  Public  Investment  Programs  (PIPs)  aimed  at \nimplementing its strategies and objectives. In developing each PIP, all ministries are involved in \nthe programming process and determination of priorities. A PIP is refined on an annual basis \nwith an investment program and promulgated as a Resolution of the Cabinet of Ministers (RCM) \nas an annual investment program. The investment program for 2005 was adopted by RCM No. \n560 of 30 November 2004. \n \nB.  Water Supply Development Program  \n \n5.  Through  the  National  Water  Supply  Development  Program  (NWSDP)  2000\u201310 \n(the Program), the Government envisages: (i) construction of water supply systems and raising \nthe level of drinking water supply to benefit 85% of the rural population by 2010, increasing to \n100% by 2020; and (ii) provision of remote and hard-to-reach areas with alternative water \nsupply sources. The NWSDP also gives particular emphasis to the adoption of new construction \ntechnologies,  demand  management  directed  towards  economic  use  of  water  and  wastage \nreduction, and enhancement of private participation and decentralization initiatives. \n \n6.  The NWSDS proposes staged development of Uzbekistan\u2019s water supply infrastructure \nby 2010. Based on the Program and recognizing the urgency to achieve of the goals, the \nGovernment has set up and started a number of projects targeted at contributing to the overall \nsustainable development of rural settlements, using the national budget and loans and grants \nfrom external sources.  \n \n  1.  Cost Estimates of the Program \n \n7.  The NWSDS estimates the total financial needs for reconstruction of the urban water \nsupply sector at $896 million until 2005, and an additional $1,527 million from 2006 to 2010. For \nrehabilitation of the rural water supply sector, the needs were estimated at $930 million (until ", "    Appendix 3  27 \n2005) and $1,706 million (2006\u20132010), totaling $2,636 million. The total financial needs for \nreconstruction of the water supply sector alone were established at $5,058 million. \n \n  2.  Implementation of the Plan \n \n8.  The NWSDP is being is implemented following three main streams: (i) interregional and \nlong-distance transmission mains and related production facilities; (ii) the rural water supply \npriority program, according to RCM No. 405; and (iii) annual sector investment programs. The \nimplementation of the rural component had a slow start, but substantial accomplishments were \nachieved  with  the  construction  of  interregional  transmission  mains.  About  $345  million \n($93 million from domestic sources and about $252 million from foreign funding) was engaged \nfor the implementation of rural and urban water supply projects, including remote and hard-to-\nreach areas of the country. \n \n9.  To provide more focus on rural areas, particularly the most remote rural settlements \nwhich are most likely to suffer from lack of continuous and safe water supply, the Government \nreviewed the NWSDP in 2003, defined a list of 3,500 villages needing priority water supply, and \ninstructed oblasts (regional administrations) to: (i) establish lists of priority rural settlements to \nbe supplied with drinking water during 2003\u20132010, and (ii) develop additional water resources.  \n \n10.  Since 2003, the Government has boosted the implementation of water supply projects \nwith the participation of external finance. By the end of 2005, 650,000 inhabitants of rural and \nurban centers in Karakalpakhstan and Khorezm are expected to be served with improved water \nsupply  and  sanitation  services.  The  committed  target  for  2010  includes  850  villages  in \nKashkadarya, Navoi, Ferghana, and Andijan oblasts. Of about 3,500 villages needing water \nsupply, about 1,100 will receive a new or renovated water supply by 2010 and the remainder is \ntargeted for 2020. \n  \nC.  Investments for the Medium to Long Term \n \n11.  Concerning the long-term investment plan beyond 2010, the 2005 investment program \nprovides financial estimates for investments required for no less than 12 water supply and \nsanitation projects totaling $363.3 million. The investment needed to provide water supply to the \nremaining rural settlements, particularly in remote and hard-to-reach areas, from 2010 to 2020 \n(in addition to the committed investments) is estimated at about $700 million. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "28  Appendix 4 \n  SUMMARY OF ASSESSMENT OF THE CAPACITY OF THE EXECUTING AGENCY \n \nA.  Project Management Overview \n \n1.  The Uzbekistan Communal Services Agency (UCSA), as the Executing Agency (EA), \nhas the required capability to lead the Project. A project management unit (PMU) has been \nestablished  at  central  level  within  UCSA.  Project  implementation  units  at  oblast  level  will \nrepresent the PMU in all technical, administrative, and financial issues during implementation. \nUCSA and the PMU will use design institutes and nongovernment organizations to provide \nfeasibility studies, subproject safeguard compliance monitoring, construction supervision, and \nimplementation of the institutional and capacity building program. UCSA will secure independent \nreview of financial auditing, and auditing for implementation of the resettlement plans, gender \naction plan, and environmental compliance. \n \n2.  In terms of long-term project management, when completed, each new water supply \nsystem will fall under the jurisdiction of the oblast administration through the oblast vodokanal. \nThe  oblast  vodokanals  will:  (i)  monitor  the  long-term  subproject  technical  and  financial \nperformance, (ii) ensure that water billing and bill collection will be sufficient to meet the planned \ngoals  of  recovery  of  O&M  and  depreciation,  and  (iii)  provide  advisory  and  management \nassistance  to  the  new  rural  water  supply  systems.  At  subproject  level  a  Drinking  Water \nConsumers  Union  (DWCU)  will:  (i)  require  all  households  and  other  water  consumers  to \ncontribute  in  a  participatory  manner,  and  commit  to  pay  for  water;  and  (ii)  constitute \nmanagement boards which will be responsible for day-to-day management and be accountable \nto the oblast vodokanal. For systems supplied from individual sources, clusters of villages \nserved from one single pumping station or groundwater production unit will join to constitute \nextended DWCUs. \n \nB.  Institutional Financial and Managerial Capability \n \n3.  UCSA has gained experience in externally funded projects. It is currently successfully \nconducting the Bukhara and Samarkand Water Supply and Sanitation Project funded by IDA-\nIBRD,1 and is the EA of the Urban Water Supply Project funded by the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB).2 Since its creation in 2000, UCSA has constructed or renovated 7,579 kilometers (km) of \nwater supply transmission and distribution networks. There is currently (2005) a well-defined \nprogram to rehabilitate 1,670 km of additional transmission mains in various regions of the \ncountry. UCSA has firm financial commitments enabling the construction of water supply for at \nleast 800 rural villages by 2010 and more commitments are in the pipeline. \n \n4.  The assessment rates UCSA and its financial management, reporting, and monitoring \nsystems as satisfactory. UCSA and the project units are adequately staffed with efficient and \nexperienced personnel. Project staff is trained in ADB procedural requirements and National \nAccounting Standards. Financial management systems in place at UCSA and applied in its \nproject operations provide a reasonable and sufficient basis for determining the state of finances \nat agency and project levels. Financial statements and other reports satisfy standards. Special \naccounts and fund flow procedures are established for each project to facilitate monitoring and \ncontrol. UCSA has satisfactory financial management capability to: (i) record required financial \ntransactions and balances, (ii) provide regular and reliable financial statements and monitoring \n                                                 \n1  World Bank. 2002.

Strengthening of Institutions through Capacity Building \n \n5.  The Project aims to construct water supply and improve sanitation facilities in rural \nsettlements which have little or no knowledge in the operation and maintenance (O&M) of local \npublic utilities. Further training is needed, although farmers are familiar with the use and repair \nof agricultural machinery and irrigation infrastructure and have sufficient technical capability to \ncarry out O&M tasks for rural water supply systems. At oblast level, institutional strengthening \nand capacity building is being undertaken to prepare personnel for future tasks. At UCSA, \nextension of the coverage activities to the rural water supply and sanitation subsector requires \nadditional personnel and provision of adequate training. Further strengthening of capacity has \nbeen identified in the following areas: (i) overall project management, (ii) financial practices, and \n(iii) project loan disbursement procedures in accordance with ADB guidelines. At the beneficiary \nlevel,  the  newly  constituted  DWCUs  must  be  able  to  operate  water  supply  and  sanitation \neconomically in the long term. DWCU capacity building needs include: (i) O&M for system and \npump operators; and (ii) training in decision making, accounting, and financial reporting to \nDWCUs\u2019 management boards and oblast vodokanals. All these needs are being addressed \nunder the Project. \n ", "30  Appendix 5 \nEXTERNAL ASSISTANCE TO THE SECTOR \n \nName of Project  Executing Agency  External  Remarks \nFunding \nBukhara and  UCSA,   World Bank   \u2022 $40.0 million loan from World \nSamarkand Water  Bukhara, and  Bank \nSupply Project  Samarkand cities  \u2022 Planned to be completed by \nmid-2007 \n    SDC  \u2022 $9.0 million grant for financial \nauditing of operator \nperformance \nUrban Water  UCSA  ADB  \u2022 $36.0 million loan approved \nSupply Project     in September 2001 \n\u2022 Currently being implemented \n\u2022 Covers Djizzak, Gulistan, and \nKarshi towns \nRural Water Supply  MOE  World Bank  \u2022 $75.0 million IDA-IBRD \nand Sanitation  specific investment loan \nProject in \nKarakalpakhstan \nand Khorezm \noblast \nImprovement of  MOE  Kuwait Fund for  \u2022 $19.8 million for Nukus and \nWater Supply in  Economic  Urgench water supply \nNukus and Urgench  Development  systems \ncities \nImprovement of  MOE - HobiHayot  KfW  \u2022 \u20ac10.3 million loan \nwater supply in  \u2022 \u20ac2.0 million grant direct \n7 rural centers in  financing  \nKhorezm  \nWastewater  MOE  SDC  \u2022 $9 million for Nukus \npumping stations \nfor Nukus \nWestern  MOE  ADB  \u2022 Approved May 2002 \nUzbekistan Rural    \u2022 $38.0 million loan \nWater Supply    \u2022 Currently being implemented \nProject   \u2022 Covers Karakalpakhstan and \nKorezm \n \nImprovement of the  Municipality of  EBRD  \u2022 \u20ac10,60 million loan \nWater Supply  Tashkent  \u2022 Implementation period: \nSystem in Tashkent  2004\u20132007 \ncity \nAsian Development Bank, EBRD = European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, MOE = Ministry of \nEconomy, KfW = Kreditanstalt f\u00fcr Wiederaufbau, SDC = Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation, UCSA = \nUzbekistan Communal Services Agency. \nSource: Asian Development Bank.

The Project\u2019s Physical Components \n \n1.  The main physical components of the Project will include the construction of: (i) 200 km \nof transmission pipelines up to 250 mm in diameter; (ii) about 850 km of distribution pipelines, \n50\u2013100 mm in diameter; (iii) 33 new pumping stations, including reservoirs and chlorination \nfacilities; and (iv) about 43 new production wells, including pumping and disinfection facilities. \nThe water supply works will also include the rehabilitation of some existing production wells and \npumping stations. In addition, the Project will rehabilitate about 170 toilet facilities in schools. \n \nB.  Existing Environment  \n \n1.  Physical Environment \n \n2.  The Kashkadarya River originated in western Tajikistan, enters the Kashkadarya oblast \nat the northeastern boundaries of the oblast, and ends its course in a desert area in the \nnorthwestern  part  of  the  oblast.  The  Zarafshan  River,  also  originating  in  Tajikistan,  flows \nwesterly, across the southern part of the Navoi oblast. The Aydarkul salty lake, occupying a \nnatural depression in the northern part of the Nurota rayon, is the largest water body entirely \nwithin the territory of Uzbekistan. In a large part of the two project oblast territories, especially \nNavoi oblast, groundwater is salinized with total dissolved solids content often exceeding 5 g/l. \nHowever, there are aquifers with variable amounts of freshwater reserves in some of the project \nrayons in Kashkadarya and Navoi oblasts. The most important groundwater resources are in the \nalluvial deposits of the Kashkadarya river and its tributaries, in the territory of the Kitab and \nShahrizabs rayons, in the northeast of Kashkadarya oblast. The quality of the groundwater is \ngenerally good. \n \n2.  Socioeconomic Environment \n \n3.  The average household size in rural areas is 6.7 in Kashkadarya and 6.2 in Navoi, with \n2.1 (Kashkadarya) and 2.5 (Navoi) persons in each household in permanent or temporary \nemployment (including children under 15 years old). The employment rate of employable-age \npopulation  is  about  70%  in  Kashkadarya  and  73%  in  Navoi  oblasts,  which  is  quite  high \ncompared with the national average. Only 31% of rural households in Kashkadarya  and 32% in \nNavoi have access to piped drinking water, mostly through a street standpipe. However, water \nis distributed for an average of 1 to 3 hours a day in most villages with piped water service, and \nthe service is often interrupted for several consecutive days. In some settlements, piped water is \navailable only once a week. Better-off households buy relatively expensive water from water \nvendors. A large part of the rural population living in project areas uses alternative, unsafe water \n(including rainwater) from rivers and irrigation canals. Consequently, at least one person in 10% \nof rural householders in Kashkadarya in 16% in Navoi oblast contracted waterborne diseases in \n2004. Parasitic and communicable gastrointestinal diseases are the most frequent, followed by \nnon-communicable gastrointestinal disease, kidney disease, and skin disease. About 14% of \nrural households in Kashkadarya and 35% in Navoi oblast have a room designated for bathing \nin their housing, but water is transported to these rooms by buckets. Non-ventilated pit latrines \nin domestic gardens are used to dispose of human waste. Most of these toilets in the surveyed \nhouseholds are not equipped with leak-proof concrete lining. In general, schools in the project \nvillages do not have water supply or have a non-functioning supply, and are equipped with non-\nventilated pit latrines comprising 4 to 12 holes.  \n ", "        Appendix 10         39      \n3.  Biological Environment \n \n4.  There are 41 protected species living in mountain and protected areas in Uzbekistan. \nSome of the protected species in Uzbekistan have their habitat in the two project oblasts. \nHowever, their habitats are found in remote areas, in the mountain ranges of the northern part \nof Kashkadarya oblast, or in the Kyzyl Khum desert in the north of Navoi oblast, far away from \nthe project areas. In all subproject areas, irrigated agriculture is intensely developed and does \nnot  offer  ideal  refuge  to  wild  animals.  There  are  no  reported  protected  wild  habitats  or \nendangered animal species in the project areas. Typical livestock grazing in the pasture lands \nare Persian lambs, goats, cattle, and horses. Flora is common and scarcely developed.  \n \n4.  Cultural Environment and Historical Heritage \n \n5.  The Kashkadarya and Navoi oblast study areas are between the oblasts of Samarkand \nin the east and Bukhara in the east. Imprints of the cultural heritage which has marked the two \nhistorical cities, Bukhara and Samarkand, are found in some places within the project rayons, \nbut always away from project sites. \n \nC.  Potential Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n \n1.  Environmental Impacts Caused by the Project Location \n \n6.  The territory of all project areas includes generally agricultural or nonclassified land. \nPermanent infrastructure will require the permanent restriction from any use of about 45 ha of \nmainly agricultural land. The location of infrastructure to be constructed can be designed with \nflexibility, taking care to the extent possible to locate permanent, on-ground infrastructures (such \nas pumping stations, production wells, and elevated tanks) in areas that would not cause \nsignificant environmental implications. Losses resulting from temporary and permanent use of \nland will be compensated in the frame of a resettlement plan. Raw sources of water (including \nsurface and groundwater), which will be selected as the sources for water supply in each \nsubproject, will have to be tested before the final decision for development. The results of the \nquality tests must prove that the water is suitable for drinking. Before undertaking long-term \nexploitation  of  groundwater,  accurate  assessment  of  the  annual  average  replenishment  of \ngroundwater reservoir will be conducted. The long-term design yield of each production well \nadded up to the yield of other wells already in use will not exceed the aquifer\u2019s sustainable \nannual recharge.  \n \n2.  Impacts Related to Design \n \n7.  Alternative design options can be developed to optimize the location of the production \nwell sites, pumping stations, and elevated pressure reservoirs which will require permanent \noccupation of land. Pipeline construction will cause temporary occupation of land along rights of \nway. Measures are taken to design and construct transmission mains and distribution networks \nin areas implying no or minor environmental concerns. Transmission mains will be designed \nalong existing roads, to the extent possible. Measures are also being taken to avoid any \nencroachment on natural protected sites of historical and archaeological importance, if any, \nduring construction works.  \n ", "40  Appendix 10 \n3.  Impacts during Construction and Mitigation Measures \n \n8.  Occupation of Agricultural Land. Measures will be taken at the design stage to avoid \nencroachment on irrigated and other agricultural lands, private buildings, and houses. In some \ncircumstances,  pipelines  will  have  to  be  constructed  in  cultivated  land.  The  resettlement \nframework addresses the need for compensation for temporary crop loss and permanent land \noccupation. \n \n9.  Increased Traffic and Use of Machineries. In subprojects supplied by decentralized \ngroundwater sources developed near villages, there will not be significant disruption of traffic \nalong  main  communication  roads.  In  subprojects  with  centralized  resources,  requiring \nconstruction of transmission mains along main and secondary roads, safety measures will have \nto be enforced by contractors in accordance with the national code for traffic safety. Temporary \nor permanent traffic lights will be installed by contractors in most sensible road crossings, under \nthe supervision of the project implementation unit (PIU). Traffic police control will be intensified \nin villages during construction and adequate warning will be provided to enhance vigilance \namong schoolchildren. \n \n10.  Air Pollution. Temporary environmental concerns related to the use of excavators, \ncranes, compressors, and other machinery during construction works will include: (i) noise and \ndust from construction sites, and (ii) safety for workers and inhabitants. Measures will include: \n(i) avoiding  work  with  noisy  equipment  in  settled  areas  at  night;  (ii)  careful  conduction  of \nexcavation, earthmoving works, and transportation of earth, particularly within settled areas; and \n(iii) use of masks by operators. \n \n11.  Water Resources. Some main natural watercourses cross subproject areas, and in \nsome cases, irrigation canals. Protection zones are normally established along the main natural \nwatercourses. All necessary measures shall be taken to respect the restriction rules within the \nmeasures. Some local groundwater aquifers constitute significant alternative resources for local \nwater supplies in certain subproject areas. Adequate waste management measures will be \nimplemented to prevent accidental pollution of water resources. \n \n12.  Soils. Soils could be exposed to contamination by the same sources of pollution as \nwater resources (para. 11). Soil protection measures are to be enforced in accordance with the \nRU norms \u041a\u041c\u041a 3.01.01-97 and \u041a\u041c\u041a 3.05.03-97. During pipeline construction, organic topsoil \nsuitable for further utilization will be removed and temporarily stored apart from the remaining \nremoved earth. The organic soil will be placed on top of the backfilling material, compacted, and \nrestored to agricultural use. \n \n13.  Waste Management. Measures at the construction sites will include provision of refuse \ncollection containers for solid waste and used oil collection containers, with further removal to \nspecially allocated disposal and reclamation sites. After completion of construction works, all job \nsites will be cleaned and landscaped. Sanitation facilities will be constructed at the work sites. \n \n14.  Historical and Cultural Sites and Landscape. The subproject areas are located away \nfrom historical monuments. Before starting works, an inventory of all historical monuments and \ncultural heritage sites will be established with local rayon authorities and oblast departments of \nthe State Committee for Nature Protection. Any discovery of archaeological remnants during \nexcavation works will be reported immediately to the rayon authorities.  \n ", "        Appendix 10         41      \n4.  Long-Term Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n \n15.  Wastewater. Operation of the water supply systems will not imply any risk of pollution of \nwater resources in the long term. The Project targets full coverage of water supply service \nthrough individual connections. Increased amounts of water used for domestic needs will be \nrecycled  for  watering  domestic  gardens.  Excess  wastewater  which  cannot  be  recycled  in \ngardens, especially during winter, will be drained out of the village areas. This water is not \ntypical sewage, as all toilets are pit latrines. Measures will include the improvement of ditches \nand street drainage to evacuate the non-recycled used domestic water in natural sedimentation \nponds outside the villages.  \n \n16.  Protection  of  Water  Resources  and  Water  Quality.  Protection  perimeters  will  be \ndetermined and fenced around the production wells fields and boosting pumping stations, in \naccordance with the requirements of the norm \u041a\u041c\u041a 2.04.02-97 \u201cWater Supply Networks\u201d. A \nsanitary protection belt is also established along the route of water transmission mains crossing \nbuilt-up areas, based on the norm \u041a\u041c\u041a 2.04.02-97. \n \n17.  Impacts Caused by the Project Infrastructure Operation. Water disinfection will be \nimplemented using chlorine. Chlorination facilities will be placed in a separate chlorination unit \nwithin the pumping stations. Preventive measures will have to be enforced to ensure the safety \nof personnel involved in the operation of infrastructure facilities.  \n \n18.  Project  Demobilization.  There  will  be  no  decommissioning.  The  electromechanical \ncomponents will be replaced every 20 years and dismantled parts will be partially recycled. \nSubstituted components of the chlorination units will also be dismantled or disposed of in safe \nrepositories for special waste, in accordance with national regulations. \n \nD.  Environmental Management and Monitoring Plan \n \n19.  An environmental management and monitoring plan (EMMP) has been prepared. It \ndistinguishes  between  monitoring  to  be  conducted  during  the  construction  and  monitoring \nundertaken  during  the  operation  of  the  water  supply  infrastructure.  The  parameters  to  be \nmonitored, as well as the frequency of monitoring and reporting, will be tested and adjusted as \nneeded during the Project. \n \nE.  Institutional Arrangements for Environmental Compliance \n \n20.  The oblast departments of the State Committee for Nature protection will be responsible \nfor: (i) environmental clearance of all physical infrastructure, (ii) monitoring of environmental \ncompliance during construction works, and (iii) environmental monitoring follow-up. The oblast \nSanitary and Epidemiological Services of the Ministry of Health will be in charge of periodic \ntesting  of  physicochemical  and  bacteriological  content  in  drinking  water  in  the  distribution \nsystem for compliance with national quality norms set out in the GU Norm O\u2019z-DSt 950:2000. \nThe PIU will be responsible for implementation of the EMMP in each subproject. The PIU will be \nstaffed  with  a  community  development  specialist  who  will  be,  among  other,  in  charge  of \nsupervising implementation of the EMMP. The project budget includes provision for training of \nthe PMU and PIU personnel in environmental procedures. To facilitate the monitoring process, \nan environmental monitoring group will be set up and will be composed of one representative \nfrom the following: (i) PIU, (ii) rayon administration, (iii) design institute in charge of construction \nsupervision,  (iv)  administrations  of  the  villages  included  in  the  subproject,  and  (v)  main \ncontractor for civil works (for impacts during construction). ", "42  Appendix 10 \nF.  Public Consultation and Information Disclosure \n \n21.  Consultation  has  been  conducted  with  the  representatives  of  local  and  rayon \nadministrations  of  the  four  core  subprojects  in  a  seminar-type  project  presentation  on \n11 May 2005 in Navoi and 12 May 2005 in Kashkadarya. All participants were invited to expose \nsensible environmental problems in the project areas and express their opinions and provide \ninput on: (i) alternative solutions aimed at minimizing impacts with particular emphasis on \ntemporary and permanent land occupation, (ii) information on historical sites and protected \nareas within the oblasts, (iii) environmentally related social issues, and (iv) problems related to \nvulnerable people. The discussions and comments provided essential background, particularly \nwith regard to information on the local environment. Subsequently, close focus meetings were \nheld with representative of stakeholders, consisting of Councils of Rural Communities, mahalla \nassociations, and rayon administration representatives from 16\u201318 June 2005. People mainly \nexpressed concern for issues related to land occupation. There was general consensus that \navailability of drinking water on a continuous base would constitute a substantially positive \nimprovement  for  health  and  sanitation.  The  draft  feasibility  study  reports  of  each  core \nsubproject, including relevant initial environmental examinations, have been disseminated for \nconsultation at the four rayon centers administrative buildings and in villages included in the \nProject from 15 August 2005 to 15 September 2005. \n \nG.  Conclusions and Recommendations \n \n22.  The Project is substantially aimed at improving the health of 250,000 rural people who \ncurrently suffer from lack of water supply and adequate sanitation facilities. The few negative \nimpacts  are  of  a  limited  extent,  can  be  prevented  by  implementing  the  EMMP,  and  can \neventually be easily mitigated. The development schemes adopted represent the least-cost \nsolution as well as the most environmentally compatible alternatives. The Project is a necessary \nstep to enhance chances for economic development and poverty alleviation in the rural areas of \nKashkadarya and Navoi oblasts. Failure to implement the Project would lead to deterioration of \nhealth, increase in poverty, and increase in emigration\u2014particularly young people in search of \nbetter  living  opportunities  in  cities  or  abroad.  There  is  a  well  structured  environmental \ninstitutional framework at central and oblast levels. Procedures for examination of environmental \ncompliance are well in place and tested. The legal basis is exhaustive and substantially covers \nthe various environmental sectors. Threats to human health are practically negligible during the \nconstruction phase and in the long term. It is recommended to implement the proposed EMMP \nand revise it in a timely manner, when appropriate. \n \nH.  Environmental Assessment and Review Framework \n \n23.  An environmental assessment review framework is in Supplementary Appendix N, which \nincludes highlights of the possible negative environmental impacts that can occur in the areas of \nthe eight supplementary subprojects as well as possible compensation measures, based on \nexamples provided by the core subprojects. The environmental assessment review framework \nalso includes also a set of environmental criteria for subproject selection, guidelines for initial \nenvironment  examination  public  consultation  and  disclosure,  and  estimates  of  staffing  and \nbudget requirements. \n ", "        Appendix 11         43      \n \nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY \n \nA.  Linkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \n       \nIs the sector identified as a national    Yes  Is the sector identified as a national   Yes \npriority in country poverty analysis?      priority in country poverty partnership   \n      No  agreement?      No \n \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in Uzbekistan: \n \nPoverty remains pervasive in Uzbekistan. Investments in social infrastructure such as clean water are considered \nimportant inputs for sustainable poverty reduction. Although access to potable water is not a problem for low-income \nhouseholds, water shortage\u2014especially in rural areas\u2014equally affects low-income and well-off households. This \nmakes poverty deeper, as it entails significant extra costs to meet basic living needs. Direct losses because of lack of \naccess to clean potable water and sanitary facilities include the following: (i) high time and labor cost related to \ndelivering water and doing household work, especially for women and children; (ii) high costs of coping strategies for \nwater shortage, including the construction of water reservoirs; (iii) high disease incidence; (iv) limited opportunities for \nself-employment development, especially in the service sector. \n \nSome 25% and 33% of families in Kashkadarya and Navoi oblasts pay about $0.4 per month on average for potable \nwater. However, households that buy water from water vendors spend $42 per year on average in Kashkadarya oblast \nand $23 in Navoi oblast. The remaining households do not pay for water in monetary terms, but expend enormous \ntime and labor inputs in water delivery, and incur losses related to disease treatment and nonattendance of school by \nchildren due to diseases, etc. The Project will benefit about 250,000 people, more than 30% of whom are considered \npoor, in the two project oblasts, through the provision of improved access to safe and reliable water supply and better \nsanitation facilities. Technical, economic, and financial analyses confirm that least-cost long-term solutions involve \ndevelopment and/or rehabilitation of water sources and water supply systems. This approach will bring social and \neconomic benefits, including poverty reduction, financial sustainability at affordable levels for project beneficiaries, and \npositive environmental impacts. Institutional solutions and community participation in design and implementation of the \nsubprojects will enhance the efficiency and sustainability of the sector program and subprojects.   \n \nAt least one family member in 10% of families in Kashkadarya oblast and 16% in Navoi oblast suffered from disease \nrelated to low water quality and lack of access to sanitary facilities. In Novbahor rayon of Navoi oblast, the figure rises \nto 36%. The most common water-related diseases are diarrhea, dysentery, gastrointestinal and kidney diseases, and \nhepatitis \u0410. Average expenses in 2004 reached $85 in 5% of families that had to spend money on treatment of water-\nrelated diseases. The Project will potentially reduce the incidence of waterborne diseases, medical cost, and the \nnumber of school and work days lost due to sickness. To achieve the full benefit of the Project, parallel improvements \nare required in: (i) public health education, (ii) higher standard of personnel hygiene, (iii) disease prevention and \ncontrol, and (iv) improved housing and living conditions. The Project addresses these aspects through the hygiene \nand sanitation education (HSE) program.  \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis   Targeting Classification: General intervention \n \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?  \n \nThe population of the rural settlements located within the project area, which comprises 12 administrative rayons in \ntwo oblasts, is about 1 million (about 155,000 families). According to World Bank studies in 2003, 21.4% of the \npopulation of the Central Economic Region (which comprises Navoi oblast) and 47.4% of the population of the \nSouthern Economic Region (which comprises Kashkadarya oblast) lived below the poverty line.1 The survey of 2000 \nhouseholds, undertaken in March 2005 using World Bank methodology and approved by the Government, showed \nthat the poverty rate is 38.1% in Kashkadarya oblast and 24.1% in Navoi oblast\u2014equivalent to 330,000 people.  \n                                                 \n1  The World Bank study adopted consumption of 2,100 kcal per capita per day (1,500 kcal) as an extreme poverty \nline. In the 2005, the poverty rate for each oblast was not estimated. In the World Bank\u2019s 2003 study, poverty rates \nwere quoted as 18.7% in Navoi and 62.6% in Kashkadarya oblasts in 2000.  ", "44  Appendix 11 \nThe poverty line is SUM12,300 ($11.3) per capita per month in Kashkadarya oblast and SUM13,700 ($12.5) in Navoi \noblast. Average per capita family income of the poor is 40% lower than non-poor family income in Kashkadarya oblast \nand 16% lower in Navoi oblast. The educational level of poor families is close to the national average. However, the \nshare of heads of households with higher education in poor families is two times lower than in non-poor families. The \nshare of employable-age unemployed is high in poor families (62% in Kashkadarya and 54%in Navoi). More than 80% \nof the unemployed are women. Most of the poor are workers on shirkat farms or self-employed who cultivate their own \nsmall plots (up to 0.1 ha).  \n \nLow income and limited employment opportunities are major reasons for poverty. Employment opportunities are \nlimited in all sectors of the economy, including the agricultural sector, due to lack of jobs, low wages, irregular and \nunsure  payment,  and  low  professional  skill  level  of  the  poor.  The  agricultural  sector  is  currently  undergoing \ntransformation of shirkat farms into private farms, a process that triggers significant labor surplus. Self-employment \nopportunities are limited due to the shortage of resources, underdeveloped market institutions, legislative limitations, \nand lack of information about ways and opportunities of increasing income in new market-oriented conditions. Family \naccess to land (beside access to private farm plots) does not reduce the poverty risk, as family garden plots are too \nsmall to generate sufficient income. Families that do not have the opportunity of employment in nonagricultural sectors \nmust become entrepreneurs, running small enterprises or being self-employed (largely unregistered small-scale \ntrade). Employment in the nonagricultural sector reduces poverty risk by almost half. \n \nAbout 99% of families live in their own houses. Both poor and non-poor families have limited access to public utilities \n(natural gas, electricity, and potable water). Some 86% of families in Kashkadarya oblast and 65% of families in Navoi \noblast have no bathroom in their housing (91% for poor families in Kashkadarya and 83.5% in Navoi). In the rural \nsettlements of the project area, no households have access to central sewage. Water consumption in poor families is \n25\u201330% lower than in non-poor, especially in Kashkadarya oblast. The quality of water consumed by poor families \nconsume is also lower. Poor families have more limited access to water storage\u2014the construction of khauzes is \ncostly, so poor families have to buy water in small volumes and spend on water delivery. Poor families spend 4% of \nfamily income on potable water in Kashkadarya oblast and 2.4% in Navoi oblast. They also bear 10% higher expenses \non potable water than non-poor families in Kashkadarya oblast and 15% in Navoi oblasts. This explains why \nwillingness-to-pay for improved water supply is higher among poor families, despite low income, compared with non-\npoor families. It should be noted that the project component on potable water supply is focused on poor families, which \nwill benefit more, compared with other families. \n \nC.  Participation Process \n \nIs there a stakeholder analysis?    Yes                   No  \n \nParticipation was ensured through consultations with key stakeholders (at central and local government level, and in \ncommunities). Key stakeholders of the Project are: (i) poor families, especially women-headed families; (ii) women and \nchildren, who spend a lot of time and effort on delivering water and housework; (iii) old-age pensioners and disabled \npeople, who encounter particularly significant problems in terms of potable water supply; (iv) local government; (v) \nUzbekistan Communal Services Agency (UCSA); (vi) Drinking Water Consumers Unions (DWCUs); (vii) project \nmanagement  unit  (PMU);  (viii)  project  implementation  units  (PIUs);  (ix) private  sector;  (x)  nongovernment \norganizations (NGOs); (xi) community-based organizations; and (xii) policy makers in central and local government. A \nfocus on data collection and analysis was undertaken on vulnerable population groups, especially the poor and \nwomen.  \n \nIs there a participation strategy?     Yes                   No \n \nA participatory strategy is an integral component in the design, implementation, and monitoring of the Project. The \ncommunity development specialists, one for each of the two PIUs, will have overall responsibility for ensuring that the \nstakeholders and communities of the subprojects are fully involved in the planning process and the construction phase \nby setting up DWCUs in each village or selected group of villages. The specialists will work in close cooperation with \nthe PMU senior institutional expert to implement the resettlement plans (RPs) and ethnic minority development \nframework (EMDF), monitor the implementation and performance targets of the RPs and EMDF, and prepare progress \nreports for the PMU and PSC.  \n \n \n ", "          Appendix 11       45      \n \nD.  Gender Development \n  \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \n \nThe participation of women in the socioeconomic life of the water and wastewater sectors implies that, to a very great \nextent, project benefits will accrue to women as well as men. There is a need to promote women\u2019s decision-making \nroles in the planning and management of water supply and sanitation systems through the establishment of DWCUs. \nSpecific  steps  to  enhance  women\u2019s  participation  in  the  Project  include:  (i)  identifying  women\u2019s  groups  in  the \ncommunity; (ii) training women\u2019s community groups to participate in project-related activities, such as health education \nand gender issues; (iii) training women\u2019s organizations, including those representing poor women, in the decision-\nmaking  process  including  planning  of  water  supply  and  sanitation  facilities;  and  (iv)  providing  employment \nopportunities for women in the activities of local governments and DWCUs.

The  physical  component  of  the  Kashkadarya  and  Navoi  Rural  Water  Supply  and \nSanitation Project will include the construction of water supply systems in 170 rural settlements \nsubdivided in 12 subprojects, located in 5 rayons of Navoi oblast and 7 rayons of Kashkadarya \noblast. Each subproject includes about 4 to 20 rural villages. The implementation of the Project \nwill require the construction of: (i) transmission pipelines from the source to the service areas; \n(ii) distribution pipelines and relevant appurtenances within the villages; (iii) pumping stations, \nreservoirs,  and  chlorination  stations;  (iv)  production  wells;  (v)  pressure  reservoirs;  and \n(vi) service connections. The source of water supply for the subprojects will be provided from \neither  an  intake  from  existing  transmission  mains  or  a  newly  constructed  production  well. \nResettlement plans (RPs) have been prepared for four core subprojects located in Kamashi and \nKasan rayons (Kashkadarya oblast), and Kyzyltepa and Nurata rayons (Navoi oblast). \n \n2.  There is a sufficiently developed legislation in Uzbekistan covering issues related to \nresettlement with particular emphasis on exemption of land use and related compensation. \nUzbekistan\u2019s Land Code is the main reference text, regulating procedures of land seizure and \nallocation  of  compensation  land.  The  State  Committee  on  Land  Resources,  Geodesy, \nCartography and State Cadastre is, with the Cabinet of Ministers, the main administration \nimplementing the Land Code.  \n \n3.  There are three main categories of agricultural land users in Uzbekistan and in all \nsubproject areas: (i) shirkhats (collective farms), (ii) family farms (farms), and (iii) dekhan farms. \nAccording to the Land Code, land in Uzbekistan is state property. Entitlements for use of land \nare granted and monitored by the state through the rayon and oblast administrations on a lease \nbasis.  The  main  types  of  land  in  the  subproject  area  include:  (i)  settlement  areas; \n(ii) nonclassified  land;  and  (iii)  agricultural  lands,  which  are  subdivided  into  pasture  lands,  \nirrigated and rain-fed lands, and nonproductive lands.  \n \n4.  Each of the 12 subprojects included in the Project will comprise a number of work sites \nof generally moderate extent. The main implications are: (i) temporary loss of land use along \nlinear excavations for pipelines, and (ii) permanent occupation of sites for pumping stations and \nproduction wells over a maximum surface of 0.6 ha. Elevated pressure tanks will occupy smaller \nsurfaces of land estimated at 0.16 ha and can be flexibly located in the outskirts of villages. In \ntotal, about 85\u201390 ha of land will be occupied by the permanent infrastructures included in the \nProject.  Permanent  structures  will  be  located  in  nonclassified  or  pasture  land.  Equivalent \nsurfaces of compensation land will be attributed to the affected families in areas adjacent to the \nlands being permanently occupied before construction works will start. The transfer to the \nlivestock will be immediate and no loss will substantially occur from loss of pasture land. The \nlivestock guardian, normally one young farm family member, will be only marginally affected. \nFarm  workers  in  irrigated  and  rain-fed  agricultural  farm  lands  and  their  families  might  be \naffected. The impacts related to temporary loss of use of irrigated and rain fed agricultural land \nis marginal and the proposed compensation would ensure no loss of family income. \n \n5.  Temporary occupation of land during construction of the various components of each \nsubproject is expected not to last more than 6 months in each construction site. Encroachment \non cultivated agricultural and pasture land, tree plantations, and household perimeters will be \navoided as much as possible. There will no be displacement of households or other village \nstructures. About 215 people are expected to be potentially impacted as a consequence of \ntemporary occupation of crop lands and another 60 workers will be marginally affected by the \npermanent occupation of land.

The exact routing of the pipelines and the location of the permanent infrastructure to be \nconstructed cannot be determined in detail at the project preparation stage. Measures are being \ntaken at the design stage and during construction to avoid locating permanent structures\u2014\npumping stations, production wells, and related protection perimeters (literally sanitary zones)\u2014\nin irrigated lands. Pipelines are planned to be constructed as far as possible along existing \nstructures, such as roads and railways. However, it is assumed that some works, such as lying \nof transmission lines, will take place across cultivated, rain\u2013fed, or irrigated lands.  \n \n7.  Compensation to entitled land users for loss of agricultural revenue due to temporary \noccupation of land will be in the cash equivalent of the average total revenue from crops in the \noccupied land for one crop year. This is estimated as the equivalent average value of annual \ncrop  earned  from  one  hectare  of  the  occupied  land  over  the  last  3  years  preceding  the \nconstruction works. An entitlement matrix is provided in Table A12.2. The project budget for \nresettlement is estimated at SUM140 million ($129,000). The costs for restoration of land in the \nexcavation areas are included in the subproject\u2019s construction cost.  \n \n8.  The sector loan will be approved in 2005 and the loan is expected to be effective by \nearly  2006.  The  first  18  months  will  include  detailed  design  of  subprojects  and  approval \nprocedures  required  for  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  disbursements.  The  project \nmanagement unit (PMU) will establish a schedule for implementation of the resettlement plan in \neach subproject. The project implementation unit (PIU) will be responsible for implementation of \nthe resettlement plan in each subproject. The PMU will be responsible for a monitoring plan to \nmeasure  the  effectiveness  of  the  subproject  resettlement  plans.  The  PIU  will  carry  out \nmonitoring and reporting of the resettlement plans in all subprojects and report progress in \nquarterly reports. In accordance with ADB requirements, an independent body will be recruited \nby  the  Executing  Agency,  to  monitor  and  evaluate  resettlement.  The  monitor  will  provide \nsemiannual investigations and reporting to the Uzbekistan Communal Services Agency (UCSA) \nand ADB during implementation, and annually for 2 years thereafter for a total assignment effort \nof 12 person-months. \n ", "48  Appendix 12 \nTable A12.2:  Entitlement Matrix \nType of Loss  Entitled Persons  Compensation and Rehabilitation  Implementation Issue \nMeasures \nI.

The  rationale  for  government  intervention  results  from  increasing  concern  over  the \nworsening  water  supply  situation  in  the  rural  settlements,  defined  by  low  and  declining \ncoverage, made worse by the slow pace of development in the sector. Despite government \nefforts at social construction in rural settlements, access to water supply\u2014especially for remote \nand hard-to-reach areas\u2014is still rudimentary. This has also led to negative impacts on the \nhealth of the poor, which recent studies confirm are the most affected. \n \n3.  Although 70% of the total rural settlements are currently within reach of centralized water \nsupply, only about 30\u201340% of the rural population still has real access to partially functioning \npiped water supply systems nationwide. The reason is that most of these supply systems are in \nvarious stages of deterioration and some are dysfunctional. As a result, residents are forced to \nuse alternative, unsafe sources of water from rivers or canals. Recognition by the Government \nof  the  seriousness  of  the  problem  led  to  reforms  being  undertaken  in  the  sector.  Recent \nregulations have been passed to promote decentralization in the provision of these services. In \nthe  case  of  rural  water  supply,  the  responsibility  for  and  ownership  of  assets  have  been \nconferred on the oblast or provincial administration, with operation and maintenance handled by \nthe oblast vodokanal through the rayon or district vodokanal under its stewardship. By detail, \nwater supply services in rural settlements are under the rayon vodokanal. However, studies \nshow that where such centralized systems exist, services only continue to deteriorate because \nlittle  could  be  done  in  improving  and  rehabilitating  the  systems  due  to  lack  of  funds. \nUnrealistically low tariffs with a poor basis or no basis of determination result in very limited \nrevenue generation. Additionally, rayon vodokanals depend on subsidies from the oblast budget \nto cover financial needs for large-scale system repair or extension works. Consequently, under \nthe  present  institutional  context,  rayon  vodokanals  are  neither  institutionally  nor  financially \nindependent water utilities. Water supply is rationed only a few hours a day and schedules are \noften not met. Many rayon vodokanals on which rural water supply depends are characterized \nby inefficient operations, poor service levels, poor state of repair, weak institutional capacity, \nscarcity of water resources, and financial inadequacy. In the past, agro-vodokanals managed \nrural systems, as most are situated along agricultural areas encompassing rural settlements. \nSome agro-vodokanals still exist but are now being gradually phased out by virtue of a law that \ndeclares their abolition. Another entity, the Obi Hayot, continues to be a service provider in rural \nsettlements, but its interests lie in managing systems that guarantee profits, and there are \nprobably no networks of the scale targeted in the proposed sector investment plan, which could \noffer the same incentive in the near term. \n \n4.  Government involvement in the investment plan is justified because there is significant \nscope  to  improve  water  supply  in  rural  settlements  through  the  provision  of  financial  and \ntechnical support and institutional strengthening, which only the Government can effectively ", "50  Appendix 13 \nprovide at present. Despite steps taken to improve physical facilities through social construction, \nthe actual flow of benefits from such undertakings is minimally felt by target beneficiaries. The \ninstitutional and economic reforms embedded in the decentralization efforts have progressed \nvery slowly within the sector, as with the others, as the country continues to assimilate a market \neconomy. The Government transferred the responsibility and ownership of existing assets to \nvodokanals through recent regulations, and private sector participation is opening up. However, \nthere is a defined need for central level management to sufficiently develop and address the \nmedium-  and  long-term  needs  of  rural  water  supply  in  Uzbekistan.  The  diverse  problems \ncharacterizing the oblast and rayon vodokanals assigned to supply service to rural settlements \nis a separate issue that requires government attention. The Government has taken initial steps \nto strengthen oblast administrations and oblast vodokanals through its previous issuances. \nThese entities now require further economic support and regulation to persevere to the intended \neffects. The Government should also attract external financial resources to free its own to \nsupport  related  prioritized  programs  on  health  safeguards  and  environmental  protection, \nempowerment of village communities through direct participation in planning and management \nof their water utilities, and promoting health awareness for quality life and economic usefulness. \n \n5.  The economic rationale is likewise sound because addressing the rural water supply \nproblems  closes  the  existing  disparities  in  service  provision  between  urban  and  rural \ncommunities, promotes economic growth in the rural settlements, and supports government \nmandated functions related to regulating the monopolistic characteristics of water trunk main \nsupply and distribution and provision of public goods. \n \n6.  Through the investment plan, the Government is taking the lead in increasing coverage \nof the needs of rural settlements in drinking water and sanitation while closing the disparities \nthat  exist  in  the  service  levels  between  urban  centers  and  rural  areas.  After  gaining \nindependence, the emphasis of water supply investments was on construction of long-distance \ntrunk and secondary distribution mains that focused mostly on more feasible urban areas. \nCurrently,  the  strategy  has  shifted  to  include  unserved  rural  settlements  when  pursuing \nrehabilitation and new construction of transmission and distribution networks, while ensuring the \nprovision of services to remote and hard-to-reach areas by encouraging the use of alternative \nwater  resources,  including  desalination.  Under  the  National  Water  Supply  Development \nProgram (NWSDP) the Government has estimated the total funding needs for the urban water \nsupply sector to attain almost full coverage by 2010 at $2,423 million. For the rural water supply \nsector,  including  remote  and  hard-to-reach  areas,  total  requirements  are  estimated  at \n$2,636 million. Total funding requirements for the whole sector amount to $5,059 million. \n7.  To help promote economic growth, the Government is prioritizing economic reforms \nthrough the sector investment plan by: (i) ensuring financial sustainability based on effective \ntariff and cost recovery systems and the adoption of water metering programs; (ii) planning \nadequate investments through effective financial management and budgeting, and by tapping \ndomestic  and  external  sources;  (iii)  achieving  further  decentralization  of  water  supply  and \nsanitation services through the institutional and financial strengthening of oblast administrations \nand vodokanals, and the establishment of Drinking Water Consumer Unions (DWCUs) at rural \ncommunity level; (iv) encouraging private sector participation through competitive procurement \nprocedures and private investments in water supply and sanitation (WSS) related goods and \nservices; and (v) supporting public-private partnerships in the ownership and operation of WSS \nutilities. The Government envisions that improved general welfare of the rural population, mostly \nconsisting of agricultural and industrial workers in the project regions, will lessen poverty and \nincrease productivity. Increased productivity will lead to higher incomes for workers in these ", "          Appendix 13       51      \nareas with the potential advancement attracting private investments that will further contribute to \nthe development of these areas. \n8.  Further to the privatization and public-private partnership initiatives under the program, \none of the Government\u2019s main polices is the establishment of a legal basis for denationalization \nof vodokanals,1 implying sales of shares of vodokanals through initial public offerings. This is \none of the foremost steps taken towards the privatization of the sector. Considering the strategic \nimportance  of  the  sector,  majority  ownership  is  still  being  kept  in the  hands of  the  state. \nHowever, there is a need for full privatization in the future for these public utilities to increase the \nefficiency of operations. More action on issues of public participation in the sales process should \nbe taken because current practice shows that vodokanal shares ending up being bought mostly \nby the vodokanal directors themselves. \n \n2.  Goals of the Project \n9.  The goals of the Project are consistent with government economic policy, which ensures \nsustainable growth by: (i) improving the living conditions of the population through focused \nsocial infrastructure development, and (ii) closing the disparity between urbanized towns and \nrural villages. Major programs have been undertaken, or are currently ongoing in the public \nutilities sector, in which the Government has recognized the acute inadequacy of water supply \nin rural areas. Until 1999, the Government mostly directed investments towards long-distance \ntransmission mains and externally-financed water supply projects through central development \nplanning mechanisms like the Public Investment Program (PIP), while local urban and rural \nwater supply investments were borne by oblast administrations. Since then, the Government \nhas  included  specific  targets  in  its  focus  for  the  development  of  water  supply  in  rural \nsettlements, and sourcing of internal and external investments to economically support these \nplans, through implementation guidelines in successive cabinet regulations. Guided by the \nNWSDP for the period 2000\u201310, the Government envisaged: (i) construction of water supply \nsystems and raising the level of drinking water supply to benefit 85% of the rural population by \n2010, increasing to 100% by 2020; and (ii) the provision of remote and hard-to-reach areas with \nalternative water supply sources. The NWSDP also gives particular emphasis to: (i) adoption of \nleast-cost technologies, (ii) demand management directed towards economic use of water and \nreduction of wastage, (iii) financial sustainability through gradual cost recovery of infrastructure \ncapital and targeted subsidies, and (iv) further decentralization of sector services. \n10.  The goals set out in the development of the proposed Project are directly relevant to the \ninvestment plan and in line with the plan\u2019s goals. By 2010, the Project aims to provide water \nsupply to about 250,000 inhabitants in 170 rural settlements, some of which are situated in \nremote and hard-to-reach areas. The rural settlements of Kashkadarya and Navoi have been \nidentified in the NWSDP as among those areas in the country with the lowest water supply \nservice coverage. Most of the rural settlements targeted in the Project have had no experience \nwith piped water supply service at all. Scarcity of water resources in many of these settlements \nhas been given high significance in project planning. Alternative water sources have been \nassessed as part of least cost planning. \n \n11.  In  Kashkadarya  and  Navoi  rayon  or  town  centers  where  centralized  water  supply \nsystems exist, coverage is reportedly about 60\u201370%. In the villages of the two oblasts, no such \nsystems exist. However, by 2010, when the subprojects will have been completed, coverage is \n                                                 \n1  Resolution of the CM No. 97 of 26 March 2002 on Complementary Measures to Secure the Realization of \nPrograms of Denationalization and Privatization, Attraction of Foreign Investments. ", "52  Appendix 13 \nexpected to reach 11% in Kashkadarya villages, and 25% in Navoi. Although this falls short of \nplanned targets compared to the Program, the Government will have already achieved much in \nterms of initial steps in the two regions. \n \n12.  The subprojects will contribute to the promotion of water conservation and prevention of \nwastage through the installation of water meters and appropriate tariff setting. Tariffs will be \nstructured so that they are cost-based and acceptable to the consuming public, especially the \npoor who make up the majority population. Tariffs will likewise be set to cover all operating and \nmaintenance costs and depreciation. Consistent with decentralization policies, subprojects will \nestablish  DWCUs  at  village  level  to  strengthen  community  ownership  of  the  water  supply \nsystem and help improve sustainability. Communities will be educated in proper water and \nsanitation practices, and their responsibilities as beneficiaries. \n \n13.  To monitor progress in attaining the goals discussed above, the following indicators (as \nset out in RCM 278) will continue to provide guidance in planning and implementing investment \nschemes: (i) main water source, (ii) location and distance from service area (km), (iii) total \ncapacity of source (m3/day), (iv) total capacity of urban/rural water pipelines (m3/day), (v) total \nwater  supplied  (m3/day),  (vi)  total  water  sold/consumed  (m3/day),  (vii)  percentage  of \nunaccounted-for-water,  (viii)  length  of  transmission  mains  (km),  (ix)  length  of  distribution \npipelines  (km),  (x)  percentage  of  population  coverage,  (xi)  cost  of  planned  development \nscheme, (xii) per capita cost of development or improvement, (xiii) per capita consumption \n(liters/day), and (xiv) total number of in-yard connections. \n14.  To  further  give  direction  to  the  implementation  of  the  schemes,  adherence  to  the \nfollowing guidelines is also monitored: (i) organization in the supply and consumption of water; \n(ii) systematic activities on identification and reduction of water leakages in distribution networks \nand in-house systems; (iii) replacement of deteriorated pipelines; (iv) implementation of efficient \nwater  tariff  policy,  which  ensures  self-sufficient  operations  and  possibility  for  expansion; \n(v) measures taken to protect poor consumers; (vi) monitoring of usage of potable water supply \nfor purposes other than drinking, e.g., watering of crops, substitute for irrigation, etc.; (vii) use of \nwater saving technologies in operations; and (viii) type and frequency of water quality testing.  \n3.  Design of the Plan \n \n15.  The goals of the plan will be achieved at least cost through centralized water supply \nsystems developed from least-cost alternatives. A structured approach will be adopted for the \nappraisal and approval of subprojects included in the plan. Subprojects will be selected based \non availability and the type of water resources, and must also be among the number of villages \nthat  are  in  most  urgent  need  of  water  supply.  For  Kashkadarya  and  Navoi,  the  oblast \nadministrations must also submit a request providing evidence that the basic conditions for \ninclusion of subprojects are fulfilled. These include: (i) willingness of the settlers to establish and \nconstitute a DWCU and select a board from among union members; (ii) willingness to set, apply, \nand pay water tariffs for water consumed; and (iii) commitment of the local administrations to \nimplement a resettlement plan for settlers that may be affected by the constructed facilities. A \nsocial survey conducted in the two oblasts reports a relatively high demand for the proposed \nservice.  The  willingness  of  beneficiaries  to  pay  for  centralized  water  supply  is  84%  in \nKashkadarya and 74% in Navoi. \n \n16.  The composition of subprojects is determined foremost by water resource type and \navailability.  In  areas  without  groundwater  resources,  contiguous  or  close-to-contiguous \nsettlements at a reasonable distance from an existing trunk main may constitute a subproject. ", "          Appendix 13       53      \nWhere groundwater is available, a subproject may include a cluster of settlements served by \nindividual  production  wells.  A  single  well  source  may  serve  one  or  several  villages.  Each \nsubproject may comprise 10 to 20 villages, all within the political boundaries of a single rayon. \nEach centralized water supply system will be designed at least cost, in terms of location, \nplanning horizon, and design. The investments will be prioritized, since the size and scope of \nthe  plan  prevent  all  investments  from  being  made  simultaneously.  Availability  of  local \ncontractors,  timely  release  of  counterpart  funds,  and  capacity  of  project  management  and \ndesign institutes will be considered. \n \n17.  Uzbekistan\u2019s freshwater resources are limited and localized, particularly groundwater, \nwhich  commonly  allows  the  development  of  the  most  economic  water  supply  systems \nalternatives  for  small  and  decentralized  systems.  The  scarcity  of  the  resource  also  limits \nalternative solutions for water supply, particularly for small centers. Surface water of quality \nsuitable for development is rare and can only be developed economically for large-scale water \nsupplies.  In  implementing  the  plan  on  a  large  scale,  the  Government  has  prioritized  and \ninvested efforts in the construction and rehabilitation of long-distance, interregional, or regional \nwater supply transmission systems, fed from centralized, proven sustainable, water resources, \nas  the  least-cost  choice.  This  is  in  comparison  with  the  next  most  expensive  and \nenvironmentally unfriendly solution: desalination of locally available groundwater, as a strategic \nplan  to  meet  the  goal  of  covering  most  of  the  country\u2019s  population  with  water  supply  at \naffordable costs. \n \n18.  For supply of rural settlements with drinking water, the main option is the development of \nlocal groundwater resources, when available, as the most economic solution for water supply. \nThis is true particularly when several settlements can be fed from one single production well. In \narid areas and areas without freshwater resources, the least-cost solution for the supply of small \nagglomerations  remains  the  supply  from  the  trunk  mains,  provided  the  distance  of  the \nsettlement from the trunk main is affordable in terms of pipeline investments. The least-cost \nsolution in this case consists of having a maximum number of neighboring villages supplied \nfrom a single pumping station, a model similar to that adopted for systems supplied from \ngroundwater  wells.  Similar  types  of  models  have  been  developed  and  applied  in  defining \nsubprojects and selecting least-cost improvement schemes under the technical assistance for \nthe proposed Project. \n \n19.  Under the KNRWSSP, 12 subprojects have been selected following the screening and \nselection process given in Supplementary Appendix F and summarily discussed above. The \ncriteria used in the selection process followed discussions and consultations between the oblast \nadministration and vodokanal representatives, rural community leaders representing future and \npotential  beneficiaries,  representatives  of  the  Executing  Agency  (EA),  and  design  institute \nconsultants. The 12 subproject areas and corresponding supply source options are as follows: \n \nKaskadarya \n1.  Kamashi      Shahrisabz-Karshi transmission (1,000 mm) \n2.  Kasan      Karshi-Kasan transmission (1,200 mm) \n3.  Kitab      Local groundwater \n4.  Mirishkor      Talimardjan water supply system \n5.  Shahrisabz     Local groundwater \n6.  Yakkabag      Local groundwater \n7.  Chirokchi      Local groundwater \n \n \n ", "54  Appendix 13 \nNavoi \n8.  Kanimeh      Damkhodji transmission (400 mm) \n9.  Kiziltepa      Damkhodji transmission (300 mm) \n10. Novbahor     Damkhodji transmission (400/500 mm) \n11. Nurota      Local groundwater \n12. Hatirchi      Damkhodji transmission (400 mm) \n \n20.  One  of  the  procedural  requirements  for  subproject  selection  and  appraisal  is  the \ndevelopment of feasibility studies, which include both financial and economic analysis, for each \nsubproject under consideration. Inclusion of the subproject in the list would require subproject \ninvestment to be financially and economically viable. Viability will be assessed based on the \nstandard  financial  and  economic  cost-benefit  analysis.  Financial  viability  would  require  the \nfinancial internal rate of return (FIRR) to be higher than the cost of capital, and that benefits are \nbased on tariffs affordable to consumers. Economic viability would be measured in terms of the \neconomic internal rate of return (EIRR), which should be greater than the opportunity cost of \ncapital. In instances where economic benefits are not quantifiable, economic analysis will be \nsupplemented  with  socioeconomic  evaluation  that  would  aid  the  assessment.  A  critical \nsensitivity analysis will complete the cost-benefit analyses and the socioeconomic evaluation \nconsidering the impacts of alternative assumptions, risks, and imponderables.  \n \nC.  Analysis of the Individual Subproject \n \n1.  Least-Cost Analysis of Individual Subprojects \n \n21.  Each subproject included in the list is designed to meet the goals of the Project at least \ncost. The least-cost analysis includes all feasible options for a given subproject, and considered \nvariations in location, planning horizon, and design. \n22.  A  minimum  of  two  and  a  maximum  of  four  alternatives  were  assessed  for  each \nsubproject based on the feasibility study options. The supply alternatives considered are as \nfollows: (i) distribution network supplied by interregional transmission mains, (ii) freshwater from \ngroundwater wells, (iii) desalinized water from groundwater wells, and (iv) surface water from \nriver or canal. \n2.  General Assessment of Individual Subprojects \n23.  Aside  from  being  least-cost,  subprojects  must  be  economically  justified.  Standard \nbenefit-cost  analysis  has  been  undertaken  to  strengthen  the  economic  justification  of \nsubprojects. The benefit-cost analysis followed standard Asian Development Bank guidelines. \nThe EIRRs have been derived for the individual subprojects. The EIRR for the representative \nsubprojects range from 23% to 36% in Kashkadarya, and averages 26% for those in Navoi. \nSensitivity tests indicate that the results are robust in all parameters. The proposed investments \nare therefore economically justified. \n \n \n \n ", "          Appendix 14       55      \n  FINANCIAL ANALYSIS \n \nA.   Introduction \n \n1.  Financial analysis was prepared in accordance with the Guidelines for the Financial \nGovernance and Management of Investment Projects Financed by the ADB and the Framework \nfor the Economic and Financial Appraisal of Urban Development Sector Projects. The analysis \ndetermines  the  level  of  cost  recovery  from  users  required  to  cover  all  operation  and \nmaintenance (O&M) expenses and, eventually, capital to achieve financial sustainability. The \nanalysis was carried out for four representative core water supply subprojects. \n \nB.  Financial Projections \n \n2.  Projections are based on information in the final feasibility study reports. Projections \nusing  pro  forma  financial  statements  are  in  nominal  terms  and  are  shown  until  2020. \nCalculations of the financial internal rate of return (FIRR), extending to 2030, are in real terms \nand include a residual value that incorporates replacements. \n \n1.  System Operation and Maintenance \n \n3.  The  projections  are  prepared  on  increment  basis,  on  the  assumption  that  each \nsubproject will be operated by Drinking Water Consumers Unions (DWCUs) at community level, \nand that DWCUs are yet to be organized and trained on system O&M at project implementation. \nAt this point, DWCUs are assumed to operate as service utility organizations responsible to \nprovide water supply service at village level, undertake minor system maintenance, set and \ncollect tariffs, and issue directives on improvement of service delivery. Institutionally, DWCUs \nwill be under the umbrella of the oblast vodokanal (water supply and sanitation agency), which \nencompass DWCU service areas, in terms of providing technical training, engineering support, \nand institutional advice. The institutional development component of the Project will ensure that \nDWCUs gain the status of certified utility organizations. During the early years of operation, \nwhen  DWCUs  will  not  have  attained  financial  self-sufficiency,  the  umbrella  vodokanal, \nsupported  by  oblast  administration,  will  provide  an  operational  subsidy  to  cover  all  cash \nrequirements,  including  partial  depreciation.  Projected  tariffs  are  set  so  that  oblast \nadministration/oblast vodokanal may recover such subsidies when DWCUs finally attain self-\nsufficient levels. \n \n2.  Cost and Financing Assumptions \n \n4.  The investment cost consists of all civil works and equipment, other development costs \n(engineering studies and supervision), and taxes and duties. O&M costs include expenses for \npersonnel salaries, power and fuel, and plant and equipment maintenance. Annual domestic \ninflation is assumed at 7% throughout the projection period. Depreciation is assumed at 2% for \ncivil  works  and  5%  for  mechanical  and  electrical  equipment.  Capital  outlays  during  post-\nconstruction are budgeted to replace fully depreciated assets during the operational stage. \nAsset replacements are to be financed out of net operating income. \n \n5.  The investment will be financed through an ADB loan and equity contribution from the \noblast administration. Terms of the ADB loan to the Government of Uzbekistan include a 32-\nyear loan period with an 8-year grace period, and interest of 1% during the grace period and \n1.5% thereafter. The arrangement will be that the ADB loan proceeds will be relent by the \nGovernment to the Uzbekistan Communal Services Agency (UCSA) at the same terms and \nconditions  as  the  original  loan  agreement.  UCSA  will  on-lend  the  funds  to  oblast \nadministrations/oblast vodokanals on the same terms and conditions. Loan repayment will be \nthe responsibility of the oblast administrations/oblast vodokanals from tariff collections at DWCU \nlevel. ", "56  Appendix 14 \n \n3.  Tariffs, Cost Recovery, and Viability Parameters \n \n6.  Subproject tariffs are calculated based on the following cost recovery principles: (i) all \nO&M cost recovery from the start of operation, and (ii) all O&M cost from start of operation and \npartial recovery of depreciation during the initial years, graduating into full cost recovery in \nsucceeding years as affordability levels permit. \n \n7.  Tariffs are likewise calculated so that they remain within the affordability of low-income \nhouseholds, set at about 5% of average household income. At the projected tariff levels, the \nsubproject is deemed viable when the FIRR is higher than the weighted average cost of capital \n(WACC). Additionally, debt-coverage ratios are computed to determine subproject capacity to \nrepay the loan, thus \u201cfreeing\u201d oblast administration/oblast vodokanal from this obligation. With \nexcess cash available after covering all other cash requirements, oblast administrations/oblast \nvodokanals may recover the amount earlier extended to DWCUs as operational subsidy. As \naffordability of tariffs is a critical issue during the initial years of subproject operation, the \nGovernment will commit to subsidize part of depreciation until DWCUs gain the capacity to \ncover depreciation. \n \nC.  Financial Evaluation \n \n1.  Proposed Tariffs \n \n8.  Currently, in the subproject areas of Kashkadarya and Navoi, water vendors charge the \nhousehold per water tanker. Monthly household expenditure for water supply is on average \n$3.08 in Kashkadarya and $1.98 in Navoi, from different sources of water supplied. Average \nmonthly household water consumption is 1.97 cubic meters (m3) in Kashkadarya and 2.23 m3 in \nNavoi. Water acquired from water tankers is for drinking purposes. Where vodokanal systems \nexist,  connected  households  are  charged  $0.03  per  m3,  although  the  current  system  of \nmeasurement  does  not  necessarily  reflect  actual  consumption.  Water  consumption  and \nexpenditures and current average tariffs in the oblasts are shown in Table A14.1. \n \nTable A14.1: Current Household Water Consumption and Expenditures\n \nAverage  Current Water \nWater Tariffs in  Household  Supply  Water \nSubprojects \nOblasts  Size  Expenditure  Consumption  Source of Water \n$/m3     $/month/HH  (m3/month/HH)    \nIn Kashkadarya  0.03  6.7  3.08  1.97  TM, GWS, WT \nIn Navoi  0.03  6.2  1.98  2.23  TM, GWS, WT \nGWS = groundwater source, HH = household, m3 = cubic meters, TM = trunk main, WT = water delivered by truck \ntanker. \nSource: Household Survey. \n \n9.  Since the subproject schemes are designed for metered in-yard connections, the tariffs \nare volume-based and structured to prevent wastage. Currently, in the subproject areas, no \ndistinction is made on household rates as a function of their monthly income. This is in line with \ncurrent government legislation and the methodology of tariff calculation applied by rayon and \noblast vodokanals, and approved by the oblast finance department.1 Therefore, the same rates \nare applied for the different categories of households. However, distinction will have to be made \nto account for consumption levels and by consumer category. Two major consumer categories \nhave been identified: domestic and nondomestic. Domestic users are subcategorized into low-\nincome, middle-income, and high-income users. By design, the low-income group uses 60 liters \nper capita per day (lpcd). Using this as base level, a multiplier of 1.25 is applied to the middle-\n                                                 \n1  The effective application of approved tariffs is supervised by the Agency for Regulation of Natural Monopolies and \nProtection of Competition of the Republic of Uzbekistan, the agency in charge of tariff control. ", "          Appendix 14       57      \nincome group for a consumption equivalent to 75 lpcd, and the high-income group, 1.5 over the \nmid-income group for 112 lpcd. This structure aims to differentiate tariffs so that the poor, who \nhave lower disposable income, will at least be able to cover their basic water needs. The higher-\nincome  households,  which  generally  require  more  and  consequently  incur  higher  marginal \ncosts, will pay more. The proposed average tariffs for the four representative core subprojects \nbased on this structure are shown in Table A14.2. \n \nTable A14.2: Proposed Average Water Tariffs\n \nAverage \u2013 All Income  Low-income Level \nSubproject \nLevels ($/m3)  ($/m3) \nKashkadarya     \nKasan  0.30  0.28 \nKamashi  0.39  0.36 \nNavoi     \nKiziltepa  0.55  0.51 \nNurota  0.38  0.35 \n \n10.  In  order  to  facilitate  the  acceptance  of  water  charges,  tariffs  at  the  beginning  of \noperations will be set to reach levels villagers are presently spending for water, at over $2 to $3. \nThereafter, tariffs will be increased biannually. The required initial increases from the existing \naverage base tariff (applied at rayon centers) of $0.03 are 320% for Kasan subproject and \n430% for Kamashi subproject, followed by 21% and 24% increases every 2 years. For Kiziltepa \nand Nurota, the initial increases are 425% and 350% respectively, followed by 37% and 30% \nevery 2 years. At these increases, financial cost recovery principles (para. 6) will be attained. \n \n2.  WACC, FIRR, and Sensitivity Analyses \n \n11.  The WACC is calculated in real terms and used as a comparator to FIRR as a basis for \nmeasuring  subproject  viability.  Funding  sources  are  the  ADB  loan  at  69%  and  capital \ncontributions from Government and oblast administrations at 31%. The assumed nominal costs \nare 1.1% for the ADB loan and 16.82% for government funds. Long-term inflation is estimated at \nan average 2.06% (local costs) and 7.0% (foreign costs). The foreign rate is computed on after-\ntax basis. The WACC in real terms is estimated at 4.49%, as given in Table A14.3. \n \nTable A14.3: Calculation of Weighted Average Cost of Capital\n \nParticulars  Investment  Investment  Capital Cost  Capital Cost \n($ million)  Weight (%)  After Taxa \nADB Loan      1.38  1.10 \nGrace period      0.25   \nRegular period      1.13   \nWACC, nominal after tax        1.10 \nLess: foreign inflation rate        2.06 \nWACC, real        (0.94) \nEquity         \nCurrent interest rate on fixed-term deposits      22.00  22.00 \nPlus: risk premium      3.00  3.00 \nWACC, nominal      25.00  25.00 \nLess: domestic inflation rate        7.00 \nWACC, real        16.82 \nADB Loan  25.0  69.4  (0.96)  (0.65) \nEquity  11.0  30.6  16.82  5.14 \nWACC           4.49 \nADB = Asian Development Bank, WACC = weighted average cost of capital. \na  Applied at 20% (including corporate income tax of 15% and infrastructure tax). \n \n ", "58  Appendix 14 \n12.  Based on the above tariff schedule, all four representative core subprojects are found to \nbe financially viable, with FIRRs ranging from 6.6% (Kiziltepa) to 7.9% (Kasan). Sensitivity tests \nare undertaken to determine the effects of: (i) a 20% increase in investment cost, (ii) a 20% \nincrease in O&M cost, (iii) a 20% decrease in revenue, and (iii) a one-year delay in project \nimplementation. The FIRRs in all four cases exceed the WACC computed at 4.49% (considering \nthe opportunity cost of government investment at 18%). The subprojects will cover the full O&M \ncosts from the first year of operations and generate annual revenue surplus on an incremental \nbasis to meet part of the depreciation cost during the first 4 years of operation, after which full \ncost recovery (including loan interest cover) is achievable. All four subprojects remain robust \nunder all adverse circumstances, except for Kamashi and Kiziltepa when revenue drops by \n20%, with both registering FIRRs below WACC. Table A14.4 presents the results of the FIRR \ncalculations and the sensitivity tests. \n \nTable A14.4: Summary of Financial Analysis of Subprojects \nKasan  Kamashi  Kiziltepa  Nurota \nScenarios  Change  (%)  (%)  (%)  (%) \nBase case    7.9  7.1  6.6  7.3 \nInvestment cost  + 20%  6.5  5.6  5.3  5.8 \nO&M cost  + 20%  6.8  6.2  5.1  6.7 \nRevenue  - 20%  4.9  4.2  3.3  4.8 \nImplementation  1 year delay  6.6  5.9  5.2  6.2 \n \n \n3.  Affordability Analysis \n \n13.  For the different subprojects, there is an apparent willingness among the rural population \nto increase water services payments and have piped water connections. Affordability analysis is \nconducted to ensure that the proposed water charges do not go beyond the prescribed limit of \n5% of the monthly household income of the poor. To measure affordability, the average monthly \nwater bill is set against average household income. Based on the planned tariff increases every \n2 years until 2020, water charges will be in average 3.2% and 3.7% of total income of low-\nincome households in Kasan and Kamashi subprojects respectively, during 2010\u20132020. In \nNavoi, water charges will be in average 4.5% and 3.0% of income of low-income households in \nKyzyltepa and Nurota subprojects, respectively. All the values for the low-income households in \nboth oblasts are within accepted limits.

Cost Recovery and Subsidy Requirement \n \n14.  With the scheduled tariff increases for all four core subprojects, revenues are sufficient \nto sustain O&M costs and at least part of depreciation during the early years of operation, \nyears 1 to 4 (2009\u201312 or 2010\u201313). The subprojects are expected to attain financial self-\nsufficiency by the time loan payments start in Year 9 (2014).

Key Assumptions \n \n15.  The key assumptions used for the analysis are the following: (i) investment costs cover \ncosts of all schemes within a subproject, are at April 2005 prices level, and are estimates from \nthe design institute preparing the subprojects; (ii) physical contingencies used on base costs are \n10%; (iii) local inflation has been considered at 7% throughout the forecast period; (iv) foreign \ninflation has been considered at 3.0% in 2005, 2.8% in 2006, 19.0% in 2007\u20132009, and 2.0% in \n2010  onwards;  (v)  O&M  costs  covering  salaries,  energy,  chemicals,  fuels,  and  others  are \nestimates made by the design institute, and depend upon the technology used and on water \nsource;  (vi)  subproject  life  is  30  years;  and  (vii)  population  growth  assumed  is  1.4%  in \nKashkadarya and 2.4% in Navoi. \n "], "metadata": {"ModDate": "D:20051219115359+08'00'", "CreationDate": "D:20051122171730+08'00'", "Title": "Proposed Loan Republic of Uzbekistan: Kashkadarya and Navoi Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Sector Project", "Creator": "Acrobat PDFMaker 6.0 for Word", "Author": "", "Producer": "Acrobat Distiller 6.0 (Windows)", "Company": "Licenced User", "SourceModified": "D:20051121060306"}}
