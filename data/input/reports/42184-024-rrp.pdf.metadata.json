THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on the proposed \nloan to Mongolia for the additional financing of the Southeast Gobi Urban and Border Town \nDevelopment  Project.  The  report  also  describes  the  proposed  administration  of  technical \nassistance (TA) to be provided by the Sanitation Financing Partnership Trust Fund1 under the \nWater Financing Partnership Facility for the Management and Reuse of Sewage Sludge from \nOn-Site  Sanitation  Facilities  and  Decentralized Wastewater Treatment  Plants. If  the  Board \napproves  the  proposed  loan,  I,  acting  under the  authority  delegated to me  by  the  Board, \napprove the TA.2 \n \n2.  The additional financing and the administration of the TA grant will scale up and extend \nthe socioeconomic benefits of the project by improving the quality and reliability of wastewater \nmanagement services in two aimag centers3 from the current project, and by extending service \nimprovements  to  two  additional  prominent  and  fast-growing  aimag  centers.  The  additional \nfinancing  will  also  continue  to  strengthen  through  the  TA,  the  wastewater  management \ncapabilities  of  aimag  public  utility  service  organizations  (PUSOs)  in  both  the  current  and \nadditional project4 aimag centers. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.  On 19 April 2010, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) approved a grant of $15 million \nfrom its Asian Development Fund for the Southeast Gobi Urban and Border Town Development \nProject, to support the provision of infrastructure and service improvement in urban areas in \nSoutheast Gobi.5 At the time, the aimags of Dornogovi and Umnugovi were experiencing a rapid \nincrease in economic activity from the expansion of mining operations and the strengthening of \ntrade  corridors  with  the  People's  Republic  of  China.  This  resulted  in  growth  of  urban \npopulations,  but  the  aimag  centers6 and  key  soum  centers  lacked  consummate  urban \ninfrastructure and services.7 The current project\u2019s anticipated impact is enhanced economic \ndevelopment and livability in the aimag centers and mining and border towns in Southeast Gobi. \nThe expected outcome is improved urban development and governance, and expanded access \nto sustainable infrastructure and public utility services in urban places in Southeast Gobi.8 Key \noutputs of the current project include urban roads, water supply networks, wastewater and \ndistrict heating, solid waste collection and disposal systems, and urban service delivery reforms. \n \n4.  The most urgent outputs were identified during the feasibility stage of the current project. \nThe government had planned to build new wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in Sainshand \n                                                \n1  Financing partner: Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. \n2  The revised design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n3  An aimag is a provincial administrative unit in Mongolia and is generally equivalent to a province. Its provincial \ncapital is referred to as an aimag center. \n4  For clarity, the original project is referred to as \u201cthe current project\u201d and the additional financing as \u201cthe project\u201d. \n5  ADB. 2010. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Grant to Mongolia \nfor the Southeast Gobi Urban and Border Town Development Project. Manila. \n6  Dalanzadgad in Umnugovi and Sainshand in Dornogovi. \n7  A soum is an administrative unit immediately below an aimag. Each aimag has a number of soums, each centered \naround a soum center\u2014comprising several administrative buildings and a small population. Less than 30% of the \nurban population had adequate water service, and only 17% had access to adequate sanitation services. \n8  The grant closing date is 31 May 2016. \n ", "2 \nand Dalanzadgad, to be financed through the state budget. Due to financial constraints they \nwere not built and the government hence included the WWTPs in the proposed additional \nfinancing. The additional financing offers the opportunity of replication to other aimag centers \nwith comparable geographic and economic characteristics and similar wastewater treatment \nneeds. Subsequently, the government added to the scope of the additional financing project the \naimag centers of Avairkheer (Uvurkhangai) and Tsetserleg (Arkhangai).9 \n \n5.  The four project aimags, with an aggregate urban population of about 95,000,10 typify \nrapidly growing second-tier cities11 and make up 5% of the national urban population. Of the \nproject aimags, two (Dornogovi  and Umnugovi) have had above-average growth in population \nand their share in Mongolia\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP), while the other two (Arkhangai and \nUvurkhangai) have population and GDP growth rates at or above the national average outside \nUlaanbaatar.12 All project aimag centers have a sewerage network serving the core area. The \nsewer systems are relatively new, and the PUSOs13 assessed them to be in generally good \ncondition with no need for replacement or expansion. All proposed project aimag centers have \nWWTPs that employ waste stabilization (oxidation) ponds as the main biological treatment \nmethod.  The  pond  systems  are  preceded  in  some  cases  (Avairkheer,  Dalanzadgad,  and \nSainshand) by preliminary (screening and grit removal) and primary (sedimentation) treatments; \nalthough in these cases the preliminary treatment units are no longer fully operational.14 In all \ncases, the treatment systems (i) are generally in a poor state of repair, (ii) use technology \nunsuited  to  Mongolia\u2019s  climatic  conditions,  and  (iii)  do  not  provide  the  consistent  level  of \ntreatment that satisfies Mongolian wastewater discharge standards. Also, population growth in \nthese aimag centers is now accelerating as the government supports an aggressive program of \napartment construction.15 This will lead to significant increases in wastewater flows as new \napartment blocks are occupied, exceeding the capacity of most of the existing WWTPs.16 \n \n6.  Performance of the current project. The current project is performing well and is rated \non track. 17 \n(i)  Output delivery. The current project (footnote 2) has made significant progress \ntoward achieving the project outcome and has largely accomplished outputs A \nand B by December 2015. Against the approved outcome, the current project has \n(a)  significantly  improved  access  to  water  supply,  sewerage,  solid  waste \n                                                \n9  The  construction  of  these  WWTPs  will  complete  a  series  of  ADB  interventions  (ADB.  2002.

Manila [G0204]) to comprehensively improve provision of and access to public utility services. \n10 Direct beneficiaries (including businesses and institutions) estimated at 80,000 once WWTPs are at full capacity. \n11 The urban economy in Mongolia grew at an estimated annual average rate of over 10% during 2010\u20132014. \n12 The average population growth rates in 2005\u20132014 were national: 1.4%; Avairkheer 2.7%; Dalanzadgad 3.9%; \nErdenebulgan (Tsetserleg): 1.6%; and Sainshand: 2.6%. \n13 Agencies responsible for operation of water and/or wastewater services on behalf of aimag governments. \n14 The pond systems will be decommissioned, except in Tsetserleg/Erdenebulgan, where they will be reused as \npolishing  ponds.  The  capacities  of  existing  plants  are:  Avairkheer:  1,500  cubic  meters  per  day  (m3/day); \nDalanzadgad: 1,800 m3/day; Erdenebulgan: 2,000 m3/day; and Sainshand: 1,500 m3/day. \n15 Through the government\u2019s \u201c100,000 houses\u201d program. \n16 The total population of the project aimag centers is predicted to reach 148,000 by 2030 (average annual growth of \n2.75%). Total wastewater discharge in aimag centers is predicted to increase from 5,600 m3/day in 2015 to \n12,700 m3/day in 2030. The capacity of existing WWTPs is of 1,000\u20131,500 m3/day and the planned plants are to \ntreat 3,000\u20134,200 m3/day to meet the demand from the growing population. It is assumed that the system will start \noperating in 2020 and that the plant capacity will be fully utilized by 2030. \n17 Summary of Project Performance (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). ", "3 \nmanagement, and heating coverage in planned (non-ger) areas in the project \nsoums; (b) ensured that almost 95% of ger area dwellers in the project soums \nhave access to potable water within 300 meters of their dwellings; (c) reduced \nwater  collection  time  for  women  and  children;  and  (d)  established  and \noperationalized  new  water  supply  sewerage  and  heating  networks.  Against \noutput  A,  standard  lease  agreements  now  form  the  basis  of  the  service \nagreements  between  the  local  governments  and  PUSOs.  General  plans  for \nGurvantes,  Khanbogd,  and  Tsogttsetsii  soums  of  Umnugovi  aimag  and \nSainshand soum of Dornogovi aimag were prepared, and approved by aimag \nkhurals (citizens\u2019 representative committees) and the relevant state expertise \nagency.18 Capacity-building seminars and training on institutional urban planning \nand implementation, and on land acquisition and resettlement were held for over \n250 aimag officials. Against output B, the current project has financed new water \nsupply, sewerage, solid waste management, and heating system improvements \nin project urban centers. All assets created under part B of the current project are \ncompleted and operational except for the Zamiin\u2013Uud heating plant, which is \nawaiting the completion of associated works before being operational. \n(ii)   Implementation progress. Implementation progress is satisfactory. The current \nproject has been implemented on time, and as of the end of the third quarter of \n2015 (with 87.0% of project time elapsed), the physical progress is at 93.5% and \nthe grant disbursement is at 93.0%. \n(iii)  Safeguard compliance. Safeguard requirements have been met satisfactorily. \nEnvironmental and social safeguard screening procedures are well established \nunder the current project and applied to every subproject. The environmental \nmanagement plan was executed according to project safeguards requirements. \n(iv)  Management  of  risks.  The  following  risks  were  identified:  (a)  poor  capital \ninvestment and budget planning; (b) underdeveloped institutional frameworks \nand poor capacity; (c) lack of monitoring and evaluation; (d) poor procurement \nintegrity;  and  (e)  weak  national  contractors.  Project  management  and \nimplementation support provided by the project management unit (PMU) and \nproject  implementation  units  managed  most  of  the  risks  successfully  by \n(a) building  the  investment  planning  capacity  of  the  local  government  and \nimproving service delivery and operation; (b) supporting institutional change on \nmeasuring and improving service delivery performance; (c) adopting a modality \nfor procurement of priority infrastructure improvements to attract better-qualified \nnational contractors; and (d) combining individual small civil works activities into \nlarger contract packages to generate economies of scale. \n \n7.  Additional financing eligibility criteria met. ADB\u2019s due diligence confirmed that the \nadditional financing meets the eligibility criteria. The additional financing is in line with the \nGovernment of Mongolia\u2019s action program for 2012\u20132016 and the high priority given to the \ndevelopment of infrastructure and services in aimag centers.19 The project is included in ADB\u2019s \ncountry operations business plan, 2015 for Mongolia and is aligned with the interim country \n                                                \n18 General plans for Khanbogd, Tsogttsetsii, and Gurvantes soums of Umnugovi aimag were approved by an aimag \nkhural on 27 March 2014 and by a state expertise agency on 6 August 2015. The general plan for the Sainshand \nsoum of Dornogovi aimag and the \u201cNew Sainshand\u201d residential district partial general plan were approved by an \naimag khural on 4 December 2013 and by a state expertise agency on 24 June 2015. \n19 Government of Mongolia. 2012.

Additional  financing  priority  met.  The  additional  financing  has  a  high  degree  of \nreadiness since detailed designs were already prepared and due diligence carried out, and \nfeasibility is established. The PMU\u2019s capacity for project management, implementation support, \nand due diligence, including safeguards, built during the current project, adds to the project \nreadiness. The subprojects under the additional financing build on the urban infrastructure and \nservice improvements carried out in Dalanzadgad and Sainshand under the current project. \n \n9.  Changes  in  project  scope. The  additional financing  will  expand  the  scope  of  the \ncurrent project by (i) adding the construction of new WWTPs in the current project aimag \ncenters of Dalanzadgad and Sainshand; (ii) extending the geographical scope of the project by \nincluding the construction of new WWTPs in the additional aimag centers of Avairkheer and \nTsetserleg; and (iii) building on the institutional reform and capacity building already carried out \nin  Dalanzadgad  and  Sainshand,  and  extending  this  to  Avairkheer  and  Tsetserleg,  with  a \nparticular focus on wastewater tariff reform and on decommissioning existing WWTPs. The \nfocus  of  the  project  outcome  extends  to  achieving  government  standards  for  wastewater \ndischarges, reusing sewage effluent, and improving local environmental quality.22 The project \nwill  contribute  to  a  more  balanced  national  urban  system  and  strengthened  urban\u2013rural \nrelationships by contributing to the development of second-tier cities in the country. It will also \nimprove environmental conditions and reduce environmental pollution in and around the project \ncities. The project will support project management, capacity development, and training. \n \n10.  The project design incorporates lessons from the current project when it comes to the \ndetailed designs23 and location of the WWTPs, and the capacity building needs of the PUSOs. \nLessons will be drawn from an ongoing ADB wastewater project in Darkhan,24 which introduces \nthe same treatment technology and thus saves time on preconstruction activities and increases \nthe  reliability  of  cost  estimates.  In  addition,  the  institutional  support  and  capacity-building \nsubproject focuses on using national consultants to help the PUSOs incorporate organizational \nand management reforms already set out in guidelines and manuals prepared under the current \nproject and through prior urban development projects. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n11.  Project  impact  and  outcome.  The  project  impact  will  be  enhanced  economic \ndevelopment and livability in project aimag centers and border towns in Southeast Gobi. The \nproject outcome will be improved urban development and governance, and expanded access to \nsustainable infrastructure and public utility services in urban places in Southeast Gobi. \n                                                \n20 ADB.  2015.

However, due to the harsh climate and terrain conditions, a cost-effective solution to \nbuild sanitation and/or wastewater facilities and networks in ger areas has yet to be found. The government did not \nrequest such interventions and priority was given to the construction of modern and efficient WWTPs. \n23 The project is based on detailed designs already completed for the WWTPs. \n24 ADB. 2014.

Implementation Arrangements \n17.  The Ministry of Construction and Urban Development (MCUD) will be the executing \nagency, supported by the existing PMU, which will extend its responsibilities for the current \nproject to include the proposed additional financing project. The professional capacity of the \nPMU  will  be  strengthened  by  adding  two  technical  positions  in  the  area  of  construction \nmanagement and supervision. The MCUD will nominate a project director for the project, and \nthe PMU will continue to be headed by a project coordinator. MCUD will be responsible for \noverall strategic guidance, technical supervision, and execution of the project, and for ensuring \ncompliance  with  loan  covenants  through  the  existing  state-level  steering  committee  for \nexternally financed urban projects. The project steering committee will provide overall policy \nguidance and will have full powers to take decisions on matters relating to project execution. \nThe PMU will implement the additional financing project. PUSO support units with PUSO staff \nassigned  to  the  project  part-time  will  assist  project  supervision  at  the  aimags.  Project \nmanagement and implementation support will be provided to the PMU through consultants hired \nunder Part B of the current project. The consultant will assist the PMU and the PUSO support \nunits in project management, procurement, supervision, and safeguards monitoring. \n \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nImplementation Period  June 2016\u2013December 2019 \nEstimated completion date  31 December 2019 and 30 June 2020 \nand loan closing date \nManagement    \n(i) Oversight body  PSC ", "7 \nAspects  Arrangements \n(ii) Executing agency  MCUD \n(iii) Implementing agencies  Aimag (provincial administrative unit) governments through the PUSOs  \nProcurement  National competitive bidding  4 contracts   $16,600,000 \nQuality- and cost-based selection  1 contract  $745,000 \nQuality-based selection  1 contract  $350,000 \nIndividual consultant selection  24 person-months   $72,000 \nDisbursement  The  ADF  loan  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan \nDisbursement Handbook (2015, as amended from time to time), and the detailed \narrangements agreed between the government and ADB. \nADB = Asian Development Bank, ADF = Asian Development Fund, MCUD = Ministry of Construction and Urban \nDevelopment, PSC = project steering committee, PUSO = public utility service organization. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \nIII.  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n18.  The  safe  disposal  of  sludge  generated  by  sewage  treatment  plants  is  becoming \nincreasingly problematic as the proportion of domestic sewage treated in WWTPs in Mongolia \nincreases. While there are potential beneficial uses of sewage sludge, dried sludge is now \nstored at WWTPs before being disposed in the landfills. The TA will be executed jointly with the \nproposed  loan,  and  will  explore  possible  opportunities  for  sludge  reuse  and  pilot  possible \napproaches. The TA will include the following activities: (i) assess current obstacles (regulatory \nand  sociocultural)  to  sludge  reuse  in  Mongolia;  (ii)  determine  potential  beneficial  uses  for \nsewage sludge in Mongolia, with a focus on the project aimags; (iii) recommend measures to \nboost sludge reuse, with a particular focus on the regulatory framework and measures to \novercome sociocultural objections to reuse; (iv) support the government in drafting regulations, \ntechnical specifications, and guidelines for sewage sludge management and reuse; and (v) from \namong the project aimags, select one or two locations to implement a pilot sludge reuse project, \nincluding evaluation and assessment of impacts and results. The TA is estimated to cost $1 \nmillion, which will be financed on a grant basis by the Sanitation Financing Partnership Trust \nFund under the Water Financing Partnership Facility and administered by ADB.26 The project \nwill be implemented over a period of 2 years, tentatively from October 2016 to October 2018. \nADB will be the executive agency and the management and execution of the project will be \nsupported through the PMU for the Southeast Gobi Urban and Border Town Development \nProject \u2013 additional financing. \n \nIV.  DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical \n19.  The  project  is  technically  feasible  based  on  a  detailed  technical  assessment  of \nwastewater management systems in extreme cold climate conditions around the world and in \nMongolia. The wastewater treatment technology proposed for adoption in all four aimags was \nsubjected to intensive scrutiny and analysis, resulting in a short list of technology choices that \nare most  suited to  operation  under  local  conditions.  A two-stage  process  was  adopted to \nevaluate alternative wastewater treatment solutions and select the best and lowest-cost solution \npossible. For the analysis, maximum use was made of the current operating experience in \nMongolia, including the technical preparation for the Darkhan wastewater management project, \nwhich adopts the same technology. The evaluation concluded that the IFAS process provides \nthe most appropriate technical solution for wastewater treatment. Measures to mitigate possible \n                                                \n26 Financing partner: Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. Funding was approved by the Urban Financing Partnership \nFacility Steering Committee on 22 February 2016. \n ", "8 \noperational and lifetime risks will be taken, such as (i) ensuring that the existing WWTPs can be \noperated  throughout  the  entire  reconstruction  process  while  meeting  treatment  standards; \n(ii) using the polishing ponds as emergency storage in case WWTPs fail; and (iii) committing the \ncontractor to continue to support plant operation for 3 years after commissioning, and take \nresponsibility for the continuity and consistency of performance during this period. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n20.  Economic and financial analyses were prepared for the overall project and for individual \nsubproject  aimag  centers  and  PUSOs  following  ADB  guidelines.27 The  economic  analysis \nincluded an assessment of the least-cost analysis of alternative options to ensure optimum \nbenefits accruing to service populations. The least-cost analysis resulted in the choice of IFAS \ntechnology  over  a  bioreactor.  The  proposed  project  will  result  in  health  benefits,  such  as \navoided medical costs, resource cost savings such as domestic wastewater disposal time and \ntreatment, and a better and safer environment. The economic benefits were estimated from the \nresults of the willingness-to-pay survey conducted in the appointed service areas. The economic \nanalysis indicates that the individual subprojects are economically viable and have an economic \ninternal rate of return (EIRR) of 12.6% to 13.1%, exceeding the economic opportunity cost of \ncapital set at 12.0%. The EIRR for the project overall is estimated at 13%, with the economic net \npresent value at MNT2,778 million. Based on a sensitivity analysis, the project EIRR will fall \nbelow 12% when the capital cost increases by 10%, the benefit decreases by 10%, and the \nproject implementation is delayed by 1 year. \n \n21.  The project  was assessed for its financial viability by measuring in terms of the financial \ninternal  rate  of  return  (FIRR),  which  should  exceed  the  weighted  average  cost  of  capital \n(estimated at 0.84% in real terms). FIRRs for individual subprojects range from 1.7% to 2.8%. \nFor the overall project, the FIRR is at 2.5%, with the financial net present value calculated at \nMNT9,404 million. Subproject PUSOs have recently implemented tariff increases based on \nrates approved by the National Water Regulatory Commission. Before that, the PUSOs were \nincurring  net  losses  nearly  annually,  prompting  aimags  to  partly  subsidize  operations  lest \nservices suffer. Tariffs were projected based on existing rates in accordance with National \nWater  Regulatory  Commission  guidelines  cognizant  of  operations  and  maintenance  cost \nrecovery. To maintain project sustainability, tariffs are proposed to be adjusted every 5 years \nstarting in 2020, when construction is completed. Tested for affordability, tariffs fall well within \nacceptable levels28 at less than 1% of average household income. The sensitivity analysis \nreflects  that  an  increase  in  operating  costs,  a  decrease  in  revenue,  and  a  delay  in \nimplementation will adversely affect the project. \n \nC.  Governance \n22.  The financial management assessments of the aimag governments and PUSOs, and a \nprocurement capacity assessment of MCUD, confirmed that, with the support of the PMU, \nMCUD and the aimag governments have adequate capacity for financial management and \nprocurement under the project. The PMU staff for the current project, who are familiar with the \ngovernment\u2019s  and  ADB  requirements  on  disbursement,  procurement,  and  safeguards,  will \ncontinue to support project implementation. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to \n                                                \n27 ADB. 1999. Handbook for the Economic Analysis of Water Supply Projects. Manila; ADB. 1997.

", "9 \ndate) was explained to and discussed with the government and the MCUD. The specific policy \nrequirements  and  supplementary  measures  are  described  in  the  project  administration \nmanual.29 \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n23.  The poverty head count national average was 21.6% in 2014. The poverty level was \nhigher in rural areas (27.0%) than in urban places (18.0%), and the former continue to have the \nlargest share of poor people in Mongolia. In 2011, of the four project cities, Arvaikheer (41.1%) \nand Tsetserleg (37.9%) experienced higher poverty than Dalanzadgad (11.9%) and Sainshand \n(15.9%). In total, 94,295 urban residents will benefit from the project intervention in the four \nproject cities. Direct beneficiaries are households in apartment and ger areas (6,245 households \nand 25,000 residents) and public and private entities (844) working in the project cities. The \nproject will benefit the poor and vulnerable households in apartment and ger areas by improving \ntheir health conditions and reducing health-care expenditures for illnesses caused by poor water \nquality and unsanitary environment conditions. The project will increase the participation of the \npopulation, especially women and the poor, in the public services\u2019 improvement processes. It is \nestimated that 200 temporary jobs will be created by the project, and most unskilled jobs will be \nprovided to the local people. Details on specific measures to ensure the poverty and social \nbenefits are in the social and gender action plan included in the project administration manual. \n \n24.  Gender.  The current project was classified as effective gender mainstreaming. The \noriginal gender action plan is still ongoing, with about 50% of activities completed and 67% of \ntargets achieved. The additional financing project is classified as some gender elements. The \nreason for downgrading the categorization is the change of the technical and geographic scope \nof the additional financing. The additional financing will focus only on improving the quality and \nreliability of wastewater management services in the two aimag centers included in the current \nproject,  and  by  extending  these  service  improvements  to  two  additional  aimag  centers. \nTherefore,  it  is  unlikely  to  satisfy  the  threshold for  effective gender mainstreaming,  and  a \ncombined social and gender action plan has been developed. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n25.  Environment.  The  environment  categorization  of  the  current  project  and  additional \nfinancing is B\u2014no unprecedented or irreversible impact on the environment is anticipated. In \ncompliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), an initial environmental examination \nand an environmental management plan were prepared for the components to be supported \nthrough additional financing.30 Short-term impacts are anticipated during construction, including \ndust, noise, and waste generated during earthwork and civil works activities, as well as minor \ncommunity and occupational health and safety risks. Operation and maintenance training and \nperformance monitoring will minimize operational impacts and risks, and optimize environmental \nbenefits. The project\u2019s climate risk is low. \n \n26.  Involuntary resettlement. The additional financing is categorized as C for involuntary \nresettlement as the project will not cause any direct or indirect, permanent or temporary land \nacquisition and resettlement impacts. The construction of the WWTPs will be done on state-\nowned vacant land. \n \n                                                \n29 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n30 Initial Environmental Examination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "10 \n27.  Indigenous peoples. The categorization for indigenous peoples is C. The project will be \nimplemented in urban areas where no specific communities of ethnic minorities or groups are \nliving. All residents will equally benefit from better wastewater treatment service. The ADB policy \nrequirements for indigenous peoples will not be triggered by this project. \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n28.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail \nin the risk assessment and risk management plan.31 The overall risk rating of the project is low. \nThe integrated benefits and impacts of the project extension are expected to outweigh the costs. \n \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigation Measures \nRisks  Mitigation Measures \nPoor choice of technology or poor quality of  Designs are based on the experience of existing WWTPs in \nconstruction, and equipment installation compromises  Mongolia.
