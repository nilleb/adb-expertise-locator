The  report  also  describes  the  proposed  administration  of  technical \nassistance  (TA)  to  be  provided  by  the  Sanitation  Financing  Partnership Trust  Fund1 under  the \nWater  Financing  Partnership  Facility  for  the  Management  and  Reuse  of  Sewage  Sludge  from \nOn-Site  Sanitation  Facilities  and  Decentralized  Wastewater  Treatment  Plants.  If  the  Board \napproves  the  proposed  loan,  I,  acting  under  the  authority  delegated  to  me  by  the  Board, \napprove the TA.2 \n \n2. \nThe additional financing and the administration of the TA grant will scale up and extend \nthe socioeconomic benefits of the project by improving the quality and reliability of wastewater \nmanagement services in two aimag centers3 from the current project, and by extending service \nimprovements  to  two  additional  prominent  and  fast-growing  aimag  centers.  The  additional \nfinancing  will  also  continue  to  strengthen  through  the  TA,  the  wastewater  management \ncapabilities  of  aimag  public  utility  service  organizations  (PUSOs)  in  both  the  current  and \nadditional project4 aimag centers. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\n3. \nOn  19  April  2010,  the  Asian  Development  Bank (ADB)  approved  a grant  of $15  million \nfrom its Asian Development Fund for the Southeast Gobi Urban and Border Town Development \nProject,  to  support  the  provision  of  infrastructure  and  service  improvement  in  urban  areas  in \nSoutheast Gobi.5 At the time, the aimags of Dornogovi and Umnugovi were experiencing a rapid \nincrease in economic activity from the expansion of mining operations and the strengthening of \ntrade  corridors  with  the  People's  Republic  of  China.  This  resulted  in  growth  of  urban \npopulations,  but  the  aimag  centers 6  and  key  soum  centers  lacked  consummate  urban \ninfrastructure  and  services. 7 The  current  project\u2019s  anticipated  impact  is  enhanced  economic \ndevelopment and livability in the aimag centers and mining and border towns in Southeast Gobi. \nThe expected outcome is improved urban development and governance, and expanded access \nto sustainable infrastructure and public utility services in urban places in Southeast Gobi.8 Key \noutputs  of  the  current  project  include  urban  roads,  water  supply  networks,  wastewater  and \ndistrict heating, solid waste collection and disposal systems, and urban service delivery reforms. \n \n4. \nThe most urgent outputs were identified during the feasibility stage of the current project. \nThe government had planned to build new wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in Sainshand \n\n                                                \n1  Financing partner: Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. \n2   The revised design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n3  An  aimag  is  a  provincial  administrative  unit  in  Mongolia  and  is  generally  equivalent  to  a  province.  Its  provincial \n\ncapital is referred to as an aimag center. \n\n4  For clarity, the original project is referred to as \u201cthe current project\u201d and the additional financing as \u201cthe project\u201d. \n5  ADB. 2010. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of  Directors: Proposed Grant to Mongolia \n\nfor the Southeast Gobi Urban and Border Town Development Project. Manila. \n\n6  Dalanzadgad in Umnugovi and Sainshand in Dornogovi. \n7  A soum is an administrative unit immediately below an aimag. Each aimag has a number of soums, each centered \naround a soum center\u2014comprising several administrative buildings and a small population.  Less than 30% of the \nurban population had adequate water service, and only 17% had access to adequate sanitation services. \n\n8  The grant closing date is 31 May 2016. \n \n\n\f2 \n\nand  Dalanzadgad,  to  be  financed  through  the  state  budget.  Due  to  financial  constraints  they \nwere  not  built  and  the  government  hence  included  the  WWTPs  in  the  proposed  additional \nfinancing.  The  additional  financing  offers  the  opportunity  of  replication  to  other  aimag  centers \nwith  comparable  geographic  and  economic  characteristics  and  similar  wastewater  treatment \nneeds. Subsequently, the government added to the scope of the additional financing project the \naimag centers of Avairkheer (Uvurkhangai) and Tsetserleg (Arkhangai).9 \n \nThe  four  project  aimags,  with  an  aggregate  urban  population  of  about  95,000,10 typify \n5. \nrapidly  growing  second-tier  cities11 and  make  up  5%  of  the  national  urban  population.  Of  the \nproject aimags, two (Dornogovi  and Umnugovi) have had above-average growth in population \nand their share in Mongolia\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP), while the other two (Arkhangai and \nUvurkhangai) have population and GDP growth rates at or above the national average outside \nUlaanbaatar.12 All  project  aimag  centers  have  a  sewerage  network  serving  the  core  area.  The \nsewer  systems  are  relatively  new,  and  the  PUSOs13 assessed  them  to  be  in  generally  good \ncondition with no need for replacement or expansion. All proposed project aimag centers have \nWWTPs  that  employ  waste  stabilization  (oxidation)  ponds  as  the  main  biological  treatment \nmethod.  The  pond  systems  are  preceded  in  some  cases  (Avairkheer,  Dalanzadgad,  and \nSainshand) by preliminary (screening and grit removal) and primary (sedimentation) treatments; \nalthough  in  these  cases  the  preliminary  treatment  units  are  no  longer  fully  operational.14 In  all \ncases,  the  treatment  systems  (i)  are  generally  in  a  poor  state  of  repair,  (ii)  use  technology \nunsuited  to  Mongolia\u2019s  climatic  conditions,  and  (iii)  do  not  provide  the  consistent  level  of \ntreatment that  satisfies Mongolian  wastewater  discharge  standards.  Also,  population growth in \nthese aimag centers is now accelerating as the government supports an aggressive program of \napartment  construction.15 This  will  lead  to  significant  increases  in  wastewater  flows  as  new \napartment blocks are occupied, exceeding the capacity of most of the existing WWTPs.16 \n \n6. \non track. 17 \n(i) \n\nPerformance of the current project. The current project is performing well and is rated \n\nOutput  delivery.  The current project (footnote 2) has made significant progress \ntoward  achieving  the  project  outcome  and  has  largely  accomplished  outputs  A \nand B by December 2015. Against the approved outcome, the current project has \n(a)  significantly  improved  access  to  water  supply,  sewerage,  solid  waste \n\n                                                \n9  The  construction  of  these  WWTPs  will  complete  a  series  of  ADB  interventions  (ADB.  2002.

Manila [G0204]) to comprehensively improve provision of and access to public utility services. \n\n10 Direct beneficiaries (including businesses and institutions) estimated at 80,000 once WWTPs are at full capacity. \n11 The urban economy in Mongolia grew at an estimated annual average rate of over 10% during 2010\u20132014. \n12 The  average  population  growth  rates  in  2005\u20132014  were  national:  1.4%;  Avairkheer  2.7%;  Dalanzadgad  3.9%; \n\nErdenebulgan (Tsetserleg): 1.6%; and Sainshand: 2.6%. \n\n13 Agencies responsible for operation of water and/or wastewater services on behalf of aimag governments. \n14 The  pond  systems  will  be  decommissioned,  except  in  Tsetserleg/Erdenebulgan,  where  they  will  be  reused  as \npolishing  ponds.  The  capacities  of  existing  plants  are:  Avairkheer:  1,500  cubic  meters  per  day  (m3/day); \nDalanzadgad: 1,800 m3/day; Erdenebulgan: 2,000 m3/day; and Sainshand: 1,500 m3/day. \n\n15 Through the government\u2019s \u201c100,000 houses\u201d program. \n16 The total population of the project aimag centers is predicted to reach 148,000 by 2030 (average annual growth of \n2.75%).  Total  wastewater  discharge  in  aimag  centers  is  predicted  to  increase  from  5,600  m3/day  in  2015  to \n12,700 m3/day in 2030. The capacity of existing WWTPs is of 1,000\u20131,500 m3/day and the planned plants are to \ntreat 3,000\u20134,200 m3/day to meet the demand from the growing population. It is assumed that the system will start \noperating in 2020 and that the plant capacity will be fully utilized by 2030. \n\n17 Summary of Project Performance (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n\f3 \n\nmanagement,  and  heating  coverage  in  planned  (non-ger)  areas  in  the  project \nsoums;  (b)  ensured  that  almost  95%  of  ger  area  dwellers  in  the  project  soums \nhave  access  to  potable  water  within  300  meters  of  their  dwellings;  (c) reduced \nwater  collection  time  for  women  and  children;  and  (d)  established  and \noperationalized  new  water  supply  sewerage  and  heating  networks.  Against \noutput  A,  standard  lease  agreements  now  form  the  basis  of  the  service \nagreements  between  the  local  governments  and  PUSOs.  General  plans  for \nGurvantes,  Khanbogd,  and  Tsogttsetsii  soums  of  Umnugovi  aimag  and \nSainshand  soum  of  Dornogovi  aimag  were  prepared,  and  approved  by  aimag \nkhurals  (citizens\u2019  representative  committees)  and  the  relevant  state  expertise \nagency.18 Capacity-building seminars and training on institutional urban planning \nand implementation, and on land acquisition and resettlement were held for over \n250 aimag officials. Against output B, the current project has financed new water \nsupply,  sewerage,  solid waste  management,  and  heating system  improvements \nin project urban centers. All assets created under part B of the current project are \ncompleted  and  operational  except  for  the  Zamiin\u2013Uud  heating  plant,  which  is \nawaiting the completion of associated works before being operational. \nImplementation  progress. Implementation progress is satisfactory. The current \nproject has been implemented on time, and as of the end of the third quarter of \n2015 (with 87.0% of project time elapsed), the physical progress is at 93.5% and \nthe grant disbursement is at 93.0%. \nSafeguard  compliance.  Safeguard  requirements  have  been  met  satisfactorily. \nEnvironmental  and  social  safeguard  screening  procedures  are  well  established \nunder  the  current  project  and  applied  to  every  subproject.  The  environmental \nmanagement plan was executed according to project safeguards requirements. \n\n(ii)  \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv)  Management  of  risks.  The  following  risks  were  identified:  (a)  poor  capital \ninvestment  and  budget  planning;  (b)  underdeveloped  institutional  frameworks \nand  poor  capacity;  (c)  lack  of  monitoring  and  evaluation;  (d)  poor  procurement \nintegrity;  and  (e)  weak  national  contractors.  Project  management  and \nimplementation  support  provided  by  the  project  management  unit  (PMU)  and \nproject  implementation  units  managed  most  of  the  risks  successfully  by \n(a) building  the  investment  planning  capacity  of  the  local  government  and \nimproving  service  delivery  and  operation;  (b)  supporting  institutional  change  on \nmeasuring  and  improving  service  delivery  performance;  (c)  adopting  a  modality \nfor  procurement  of  priority  infrastructure improvements  to attract  better-qualified \nnational contractors; and (d) combining individual small civil works activities into \nlarger contract packages to generate economies of scale. \n\n \n7. \nAdditional  financing  eligibility  criteria  met.  ADB\u2019s  due  diligence  confirmed  that  the \nadditional  financing  meets  the  eligibility  criteria.  The  additional  financing  is  in  line  with  the \nGovernment  of  Mongolia\u2019s  action  program  for  2012\u20132016  and  the  high  priority  given  to  the \ndevelopment of infrastructure and services in aimag centers.19 The project is included in ADB\u2019s \ncountry  operations  business  plan,  2015  for  Mongolia  and  is  aligned  with  the  interim  country \n\n                                                \n18 General plans for Khanbogd, Tsogttsetsii, and Gurvantes soums of Umnugovi aimag were approved by an aimag \nkhural on 27 March 2014 and by a state expertise agency on 6 August 2015. The general plan for the  Sainshand \nsoum  of  Dornogovi  aimag  and  the  \u201cNew  Sainshand\u201d  residential  district  partial  general  plan  were  approved by  an \naimag khural on 4 December 2013 and by a state expertise agency on 24 June 2015. \n\n19 Government  of  Mongolia.  2012.  Action  Program  of  the  Reform  Government  through  the  Years  2012\u20132016. \n\nUlaanbaatar (the document is in Mongolian and has no official English translation). \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\npartnership  program,  2014\u20132016.20 With  its  objective  to  contribute  to  inclusive  economic  and \nenvironmentally  sustainable  growth,  the  project  is  also  aligned  with  ADB\u2019s  Midterm  Review  of \nStrategy 2020, and follows ADB\u2019s urban and water operational plans.21 \n \nAdditional  financing  priority  met.  The  additional  financing  has  a  high  degree  of \n8. \nreadiness  since  detailed  designs  were  already  prepared  and  due  diligence  carried  out,  and \nfeasibility is established. The PMU\u2019s capacity for project management, implementation support, \nand  due  diligence,  including  safeguards,  built  during  the  current  project,  adds  to  the  project \nreadiness. The subprojects under the additional financing build on the urban infrastructure and \nservice improvements carried out in Dalanzadgad and Sainshand under the current project. \n \n9. \nChanges  in  project  scope.  The  additional  financing  will  expand  the  scope  of  the \ncurrent  project  by  (i)  adding  the  construction  of  new  WWTPs  in  the  current  project  aimag \ncenters of Dalanzadgad and Sainshand; (ii) extending the geographical scope of the project by \nincluding  the  construction  of  new  WWTPs  in  the  additional  aimag  centers  of  Avairkheer  and \nTsetserleg; and (iii) building on the institutional reform and capacity building already carried out \nin  Dalanzadgad  and  Sainshand,  and  extending  this  to  Avairkheer  and  Tsetserleg,  with  a \nparticular  focus  on  wastewater  tariff  reform  and  on  decommissioning  existing  WWTPs.  The \nfocus  of  the  project  outcome  extends  to  achieving  government  standards  for  wastewater \ndischarges,  reusing  sewage  effluent,  and  improving  local  environmental  quality.22 The  project \nwill  contribute  to  a  more  balanced  national  urban  system  and  strengthened  urban\u2013rural \nrelationships  by  contributing to  the  development of  second-tier  cities  in  the country.  It  will  also \nimprove environmental conditions and reduce environmental pollution in and around the project \ncities. The project will support project management, capacity development, and training. \n \n10. \nThe  project  design  incorporates  lessons  from  the  current  project  when  it  comes  to  the \ndetailed designs23 and location of the WWTPs, and the capacity building needs of the PUSOs. \nLessons will be drawn from an ongoing ADB wastewater project in Darkhan,24 which introduces \nthe same treatment technology and thus saves time on preconstruction activities and increases \nthe  reliability  of  cost  estimates.  In  addition,  the  institutional  support  and  capacity-building \nsubproject focuses on using national consultants to help the PUSOs incorporate organizational \nand management reforms already set out in guidelines and manuals prepared under the current \nproject and through prior urban development projects. \n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nProject  impact  and  outcome.  The  project  impact  will  be  enhanced  economic \n11. \ndevelopment  and  livability  in  project  aimag  centers  and  border  towns  in  Southeast  Gobi.

The  professional  capacity  of  the \nPMU  will  be  strengthened  by  adding  two  technical  positions  in  the  area  of  construction \nmanagement  and  supervision.  The  MCUD  will  nominate  a  project  director  for  the  project,  and \nthe  PMU  will  continue  to  be  headed  by  a  project  coordinator.  MCUD  will  be  responsible  for \noverall strategic guidance, technical supervision, and execution of the project, and for ensuring \ncompliance  with  loan  covenants  through  the  existing  state-level  steering  committee  for \nexternally  financed  urban  projects.  The  project  steering  committee  will  provide  overall  policy \nguidance  and  will  have  full  powers  to  take  decisions  on  matters  relating  to  project  execution. \nThe  PMU  will  implement  the  additional financing  project.  PUSO  support units  with  PUSO  staff \nassigned  to  the  project  part-time  will  assist  project  supervision  at  the  aimags.

While  there  are  potential  beneficial  uses  of  sewage  sludge,  dried  sludge  is  now \nstored at WWTPs before being disposed in the landfills. The TA will be executed jointly with the \nproposed  loan,  and  will  explore  possible  opportunities  for  sludge  reuse  and  pilot  possible \napproaches. The TA will include the following activities: (i) assess current obstacles (regulatory \nand  sociocultural)  to  sludge  reuse  in  Mongolia;  (ii)  determine  potential  beneficial  uses  for \nsewage  sludge  in  Mongolia,  with  a  focus  on  the  project  aimags;  (iii) recommend  measures  to \nboost  sludge  reuse,  with  a  particular  focus  on  the  regulatory  framework  and  measures  to \novercome sociocultural objections to reuse; (iv) support the government in drafting regulations, \ntechnical specifications, and guidelines for sewage sludge management and reuse; and (v) from \namong the project aimags, select one or two locations to implement a pilot sludge reuse project, \nincluding  evaluation  and  assessment  of  impacts  and  results.  The  TA  is  estimated  to  cost  $1 \nmillion,  which  will  be  financed  on  a  grant  basis  by  the  Sanitation  Financing  Partnership  Trust \nFund  under  the  Water  Financing  Partnership  Facility  and  administered  by  ADB.26 The  project \nwill  be  implemented  over  a  period  of  2  years,  tentatively  from  October  2016  to  October  2018. \nADB  will  be  the  executive  agency  and  the  management  and  execution  of  the  project  will  be \nsupported  through  the  PMU  for  the  Southeast  Gobi  Urban  and  Border  Town  Development \nProject \u2013 additional financing. \n \n\nIV. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nA. \n\nTechnical \n\n19. \nThe  project  is  technically  feasible  based  on  a  detailed  technical  assessment  of \nwastewater  management  systems  in  extreme  cold  climate  conditions  around  the  world  and  in \nMongolia.  The  wastewater  treatment  technology  proposed for  adoption  in  all  four  aimags  was \nsubjected  to  intensive scrutiny  and  analysis, resulting  in  a  short  list  of technology  choices  that \nare  most  suited  to  operation  under  local  conditions.  A  two-stage  process  was  adopted  to \nevaluate alternative wastewater treatment solutions and select the best and lowest-cost solution \npossible.  For  the  analysis,  maximum  use  was  made  of  the  current  operating  experience  in \nMongolia, including the technical preparation for the Darkhan wastewater management project, \nwhich  adopts  the  same technology.  The  evaluation  concluded  that  the  IFAS  process  provides \nthe most appropriate technical solution for wastewater treatment. Measures to mitigate possible \n\n                                                \n26 Financing  partner:  Bill  &  Melinda  Gates  Foundation.  Funding  was  approved  by  the  Urban  Financing  Partnership \n\nFacility Steering Committee on 22 February 2016. \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\noperational and lifetime risks will be taken, such as (i) ensuring that the existing WWTPs can be \noperated  throughout  the  entire  reconstruction  process  while  meeting  treatment  standards; \n(ii) using the polishing ponds as emergency storage in case WWTPs fail; and (iii) committing the \ncontractor  to  continue  to  support  plant  operation  for  3  years  after  commissioning,  and  take \nresponsibility for the continuity and consistency of performance during this period. \n \nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\nEconomic and financial analyses were prepared for the overall project and for individual \n20. \nsubproject  aimag  centers  and  PUSOs  following  ADB  guidelines. 27  The  economic  analysis \nincluded  an  assessment  of  the  least-cost  analysis  of  alternative  options  to  ensure  optimum \nbenefits accruing to service populations. The least-cost analysis resulted in the choice of IFAS \ntechnology  over  a  bioreactor.  The  proposed  project  will  result  in  health  benefits,  such  as \navoided medical costs, resource cost savings  such as domestic wastewater disposal time and \ntreatment, and a better and safer environment. The economic benefits were estimated from the \nresults of the willingness-to-pay survey conducted in the appointed service areas. The economic \nanalysis indicates that the individual subprojects are economically viable and have an economic \ninternal  rate  of  return  (EIRR)  of  12.6%  to  13.1%,  exceeding  the  economic  opportunity  cost  of \ncapital set at 12.0%. The EIRR for the project overall is estimated at 13%, with the economic net \npresent  value  at  MNT2,778  million.  Based  on  a  sensitivity  analysis,  the  project  EIRR  will  fall \nbelow  12%  when  the  capital  cost  increases  by  10%,  the  benefit  decreases  by  10%,  and  the \nproject implementation is delayed by 1 year. \n \n21. \nThe project  was assessed for its financial viability by measuring in terms of the financial \ninternal  rate  of  return  (FIRR),  which  should  exceed  the  weighted  average  cost  of  capital \n(estimated at 0.84% in real terms). FIRRs for individual subprojects range from 1.7% to 2.8%. \nFor  the  overall  project,  the  FIRR  is  at  2.5%,  with  the  financial  net  present  value  calculated  at \nMNT9,404  million.  Subproject  PUSOs  have  recently  implemented  tariff  increases  based  on \nrates  approved  by  the  National  Water  Regulatory  Commission.  Before  that,  the  PUSOs  were \nincurring  net  losses  nearly  annually,  prompting  aimags  to  partly  subsidize  operations  lest \nservices  suffer.  Tariffs  were  projected  based  on  existing  rates  in  accordance  with  National \nWater  Regulatory  Commission  guidelines  cognizant  of  operations  and  maintenance  cost \nrecovery.  To  maintain  project  sustainability,  tariffs  are  proposed  to  be  adjusted  every  5  years \nstarting  in  2020,  when  construction  is  completed.  Tested  for  affordability,  tariffs  fall  well  within \nacceptable  levels 28 at  less  than  1%  of  average  household  income.  The  sensitivity  analysis \nreflects  that  an  increase  in  operating  costs,  a  decrease  in  revenue,  and  a  delay  in \nimplementation will adversely affect the project. \n \nC. \n\nGovernance \n\nThe financial management assessments of the  aimag governments and PUSOs, and a \n22. \nprocurement  capacity  assessment  of  MCUD,  confirmed  that,  with  the  support  of  the  PMU, \nMCUD  and  the  aimag  governments  have  adequate  capacity  for  financial  management  and \nprocurement under the project. The PMU staff for the current project, who are familiar with the \ngovernment\u2019s  and  ADB  requirements  on  disbursement,  procurement,  and  safeguards,  will \ncontinue to support project implementation. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to \n                                                \n27 ADB. 1999. Handbook for the Economic Analysis of Water Supply Projects. Manila; ADB. 1997.

The specific policy \nrequirements  and  supplementary  measures  are  described  in  the  project  administration \nmanual.29 \n \nD. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n23. \nThe  poverty  head  count  national  average  was  21.6%  in  2014.  The  poverty  level  was \nhigher in rural areas (27.0%) than in urban places (18.0%), and the former continue to have the \nlargest share of poor people in Mongolia. In 2011, of the four project cities, Arvaikheer (41.1%) \nand Tsetserleg (37.9%) experienced higher poverty than Dalanzadgad (11.9%) and Sainshand \n(15.9%).  In  total,  94,295  urban  residents  will  benefit  from  the  project  intervention  in  the  four \nproject cities. Direct beneficiaries are households in apartment and ger areas (6,245 households \nand  25,000  residents)  and  public  and  private  entities  (844)  working  in  the  project  cities.  The \nproject will benefit the poor and vulnerable households in apartment and ger areas by improving \ntheir health conditions and reducing health-care expenditures for illnesses caused by poor water \nquality and unsanitary environment conditions. The project will increase the participation of the \npopulation, especially women and the poor, in the public services\u2019 improvement processes. It is \nestimated that 200 temporary jobs will be created by the project, and most unskilled jobs will be \nprovided  to  the  local  people.  Details  on  specific  measures  to  ensure  the  poverty  and  social \nbenefits are in the social and gender action plan included in the project administration manual. \n \n24. \nGender.  The  current  project  was  classified  as  effective  gender  mainstreaming.  The \noriginal gender  action  plan  is  still  ongoing,  with about  50%  of  activities  completed  and  67% of \ntargets  achieved.  The  additional  financing  project  is  classified  as  some  gender  elements.  The \nreason for downgrading the categorization is the change of the technical and geographic scope \nof the additional financing. The additional financing will focus only on improving the quality and \nreliability of wastewater management services in the two aimag centers included in the current \nproject,  and  by  extending  these  service  improvements  to  two  additional  aimag  centers. \nTherefore,  it  is  unlikely  to  satisfy  the  threshold  for  effective  gender  mainstreaming,  and  a \ncombined social and gender action plan has been developed. \n \nE. \n\nSafeguards \n\n25. \nEnvironment.  The  environment  categorization  of  the  current  project  and  additional \nfinancing  is  B\u2014no  unprecedented  or  irreversible  impact  on  the  environment  is  anticipated.  In \ncompliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), an initial environmental examination \nand  an  environmental  management  plan  were  prepared  for  the  components  to  be  supported \nthrough additional financing.30 Short-term impacts are anticipated during construction, including \ndust,  noise,  and  waste  generated  during  earthwork  and  civil  works  activities,  as  well  as minor \ncommunity  and  occupational  health  and  safety  risks.  Operation  and maintenance  training  and \nperformance monitoring will minimize operational impacts and risks, and optimize environmental \nbenefits. The project\u2019s climate risk is low. \n \n26. \nInvoluntary  resettlement.  The  additional  financing  is  categorized  as  C  for  involuntary \nresettlement  as  the  project  will  not  cause  any  direct  or  indirect,  permanent  or  temporary  land \nacquisition  and  resettlement  impacts.  The  construction  of  the  WWTPs  will  be  done  on  state-\nowned vacant land. \n \n\n                                                \n29 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n30 Initial Environmental Examination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\nIndigenous peoples. The categorization for indigenous peoples is C. The project will be \n27. \nimplemented  in  urban  areas  where  no  specific  communities  of  ethnic  minorities  or  groups  are \nliving. All residents will equally benefit from better wastewater treatment service. The ADB policy \nrequirements for indigenous peoples will not be triggered by this project. \n \nF. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n28.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail \nin the risk assessment and risk management plan.31 The overall risk rating of the project is low. \nThe integrated benefits and impacts of the project extension are expected to outweigh the costs. \n \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigation Measures \n\nRisks \nPoor choice of technology or poor quality of \nconstruction, and equipment installation compromises \n\nLimited procurement and project management skills, \ncapacity, and experience compromise tendering and \nproject quality \nPoor cost recovery compromises operational \nsustainability \n\nMitigation Measures \nDesigns are based on the experience of existing WWTPs in \nMongolia.
