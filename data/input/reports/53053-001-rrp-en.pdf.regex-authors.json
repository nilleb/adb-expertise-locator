THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nthe People\u2019s Republic of China for the Henan Xichuan Integrated Ecological Protection and \nEnvironmental Improvement Project. \n \n2.  The proposed project will promote environmental improvements and green development in \necologically sensitive rural areas by (i) building the capacity of the Xichuan County Government \n(XCG) in environmental planning and management; (ii) promoting soil and water conservation \nthrough the use of high-level technology, including remote sensing, smart drip irrigation, and \nperipheral rainfall runoff harvesting; and (iii) improving rural waste management and integrated \nurban\u2013rural water supply systems. The project will (i) play a demonstrative role for rural vitalization; \n(ii) promote regional public goods by preserving natural resources and reversing the negative \nimpacts of environmental pollution; and (iii) facilitate recovery in the project area from the economic \nimpacts of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) through inclusive rural economic development. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  The Yangtze River Economic Belt (YREB) and its nine provinces and two specially \nadministered municipalities are one of the three key economic growth engines in the People\u2019s \nRepublic of China (PRC), accounting for more than 40% of the PRC\u2019s population and freshwater \nresources, and 45% of the country\u2019s economic output. While the YREB has benefited from \nextensive development since the 1990s, economic growth in the middle and upper reaches of the \nYangtze River basin lags significantly behind that in the lower reaches. In many rural areas of the \nYREB, agricultural production and rural livelihoods have lagged behind industrial production and \nurban livelihoods, and income inequality and poverty persist. The majority of rural wastewater, as \nwell as other waste, is being directly discharged to waterways, while solid waste, particularly \nplastic waste, is increasing. To promote poverty reduction, rural development, and green and \ninclusive growth, the government formulated the National Strategic Plan for Rural Vitalization, \n2018\u20132022.1 The strategic plan focuses on agricultural modernization, rural wastewater and \nwaste management, rural\u2013urban integration, ecosystem services protection, and governance \nreform. \n \n4.  Project area. Xichuan County, located in Nanyang City, Henan Province, is rural and was \none of 53 remaining national poverty counties in the PRC in 2020. In 2018, Xichuan County had a \nregistered population of 724,600 (including 52.6% males and 47.4% females). Of the 626,100 \npermanent resident population; about 56.7% are rural residents, with an average per capita income \nof CNY12,114, which is below the PRC\u2019s average rural per capita income of CNY14,671.2 The \ncounty\u2019s institutional capacity for environmental planning and management is weak, which is critical \nas it is a source of water for the South-to-North Water Diversion Project.3 The county faces various \nrestrictions on development activities mainly because of concerns over degradation of quality and \nquantity of water in the Danjiangkou Reservoir (footnote 3). Xichuan County is also part of the Han \nRiver watershed in the Yangtze River basin, which has been designated a national key ecological \n \n1  Government of the PRC. 2018. National Strategic Plan for Rural Vitalization, 2018\u20132022. Beijing. \n2  Bureau of Statistics of Xichuan County. \n3  Danjiangkou Reservoir, located in Xichuan County, was constructed in the 1950s for hydropower and irrigation and \nis one of the largest river impoundments in the Yangtze River basin. The reservoir supplies (through a 1,300 \nkilometer-long canal) 13 billion cubic meters of water annually to 14 large- and medium-sized cities in the northern \nPRC, including Beijing and Tianjin, benefiting more than 53 million people.  ", "2 \nfunction zone by the government; it is geologically and ecologically fragile because of extreme soil \nerosion and rocky desertification.4 The frequency and intensity of devastating floods have increased \nfrom 1990 to 2020 as a result of ecological degradation and climate change.5 Most of the county\u2019s \nrural population lacks basic water and sanitation facilities, which negatively impacts public health \nand the environment. The government needs to adopt a unique, integrated development approach \nthat (i) improves the livelihoods; (ii) improves the water quality and river environment; and (iii) \nconserves the ecosystem. Although not officially part of the YREB territory, Xichuan County is part \nof a cluster of counties in the Yangtze River basin surrounding the YREB that contribute to the \nYREB\u2019s development goals.6 \n \n5.  Institutional  and  programmatic  issues.  The  unmet  requirements  of  Danjiangkou \nReservoir protection and ecological conservation has restricted the socioeconomic development \nopportunity  in  the  county,  resulting  in  large  costs.  To  achieve  equitable  development,  the \ngovernment has established an eco-compensation mechanism between water service providers, \nincluding Xichuan County, and the areas that benefit, including the Beijing and Tianjin municipal \ngovernments,  but  that  mechanism  is  yet  to  be  institutionalized  with  guidelines.  To  support \nnegotiations  regarding  eco-compensation  with  beneficiaries,  XCG  needs  comprehensive \nenvironmental and ecological protection plans that would ensure a flow of desired ecological \nservices, with proper monitoring and evaluation mechanisms and community participation. XCG \nhas engaged in ongoing investment in public infrastructure, but these investments have not \ndelivered  the  needed  results;  for  example,  construction  of  poorly  planned  rural  roads  has \nexacerbated soil erosion in the ecologically fragile and environmentally sensitive landscape. The \ninstitutional reform in the PRC in 2018 has not yet been fully reflected in the mandates of local line \nagencies, which require close coordination. The county\u2019s unique geophysical characteristics require \ndevelopment planning to be based on sound research across multiple settings in the watershed. \n \n6.  Farmers are reluctant to shift from conventional agricultural practices to environmentally-\nfriendly, profit-oriented agrobusinesses because of a lack of knowledge and underdeveloped value \nchains\u2014primarily facilities for bulk handling (between harvest and marketing) of perishable products. \nThe county lacks farmer cooperatives and agribusiness enterprises that link farmers to markets, \nresulting in a large volume of locally produced vegetables and fruits ending up as waste. The reservoir \nshore is a scenic region, and ecotourism and other initiatives have been promoted that seek to build \nrural  economies  without  harming  the  environment.  However,  implementation  is  hampered  by \ninadequate tourist facilities and difficult access. Recurring floods and the absence of a reliable flood \nearly warning system also contribute to poor development performance. A lack of environmental \nawareness  among  farmers,  the  absence  of  local  incentives,  and  marginal  use  of  high-level \ntechnologies have impaired public service deliveries in the county. XCG needs to strengthen its \ninstitutional capacity to manage these challenges. \n \n7.  Impaired ecosystem services. About 2,600 square kilometers (km2) (93%) of the county \narea falls in the Danjiangkou Reservoir catchment area. The county has 580 km2 of farmland and \n506 km2 of water surface, while about 65% of the county is comprised of steep mountains; these \nare the site of some 45% of farmlands that are located around the reservoir inlets. More than 50% \nof the county\u2019s area is designated as active rocky desertification area (footnote 4), with very low \nsoil formation rates. The average water induced soil erosion rate in this area is estimated at about \n100 ton/hectare (ha)/year or double the threshold of 50 ton/ha/year for high erosion defined by \n \n4  Rocky desertification refers to the hydrogeological processes and human activities that transform karst areas \n(composed of soluble bedrock such as limestone) covered by vegetation and soil into a rocky landscape. \n5  In 2010, flooding caused about CNY658 million in economic losses in the county. \n6  Government of the PRC. 2017. Ecological and Environmental Protection Plan of Yangtze River Economic Belt. \nBeijing.  \n ", "3 \nthe United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization.7 Human interventions, including farming, \nexacerbate rocky desertification in more than 80,000 ha within the county. The average annual \nrainfall in the mountainous area in the county is about 1,300 millimeters, which falls primarily \nduring July\u2013October. Fatal flash floods were recorded in 2010, 2011, 2017, and 2018. In 2010 \nalone, economic damage in XCG from flash flood events was about CNY658 million, mostly in \nagriculture. Flash flood events are exacerbated by poor drainage infrastructure and clogging of \nnatural creeks by sediment in low-lying areas. \n \n8.  The fragile geologic features with poor vegetation and farming on slopes leach nutrients, \nsignificantly reducing soil productivity and water quality. Grain production in the county fell from \n7.01 ton/ha in 2010 to 4.5 ton/ha in 2019. Farmland is prepared prior to the rainy season, which \naggravates soil erosion. Some farmlands have been transformed into rocky landscapes that are \nno longer cultivable. About 1,300 kilograms of chemical fertilizer are used annually per ha of \ncultivated land in Xichuan County, which is the highest amount in the PRC.8 An estimated 6,000 \ntons of fertilizer is lost from farmland in the county annually, contributing to environmental \npollution. To solve this and improve farmers\u2019 incomes, XCG converted 21,000 ha of farmland into \nfruit plantations. However, this did not achieve the result because of inadequate irrigation, \ncontinued soil erosion, and poor operation and maintenance (O&M), including difficulties in \nmonitoring land degradation and plant health. Farmers have established their own individual \ngroundwater pumps for irrigation and are unaware of current on-farm water and energy efficiency \nlevels. As a result, groundwater is overexploited and water quality in the Danjiang and Laoguan \nrivers in the county in the proximity of the Danjiangkou Reservoir has exceeded Class III with high \nnutrient concentrations.9 Industries are not allowed in the county, meaning that farmland and rural \nvillages without sanitation and waste management are the main pollution sources. \n \n9.  Rural water services. The sewage network currently covers a portion of urban areas but \nalmost none of the county\u2019s rural areas. Total annual wastewater production in the county is \nestimated at about 13 million cubic meters (m3). There are 14 wastewater treatment plants with \ncapacity of 100,300 m3/day; the capacity exceeds the current need but serves only a portion of \nurban areas because of their poor spatial distribution and the lack of a wastewater collection \nnetwork. As a result, all rural wastewater and 30% of wastewater from urban areas is being \ndischarged into the local rivers without any treatment. Poor sanitation prevails in rural areas with \nmany households lacking reliable piped water supply and toilets, prompting many people to resort \nto open defecation. The county produces 202,000 tons of solid waste (and an additional 1,000 \ntons of plastic waste) and 128,700 tons of farm waste annually. The solid waste is mostly dumped \nin public spaces and flushed to rivers by surface runoff during rainy season. \n \n10.  Despite experiencing acute water scarcity, the county helps resolve the water scarcity \nproblems in the water-deprived northern region of the PRC through the South-to-North Water \nDiversion Project. Much as with sanitation and waste management, most of the county\u2019s rural \npopulation lack access to a proper water supply. Majority of the population depends on untreated \nprivate tube-wells or shared spring sources, resulting in poor health and creating a heavy burden, \nparticularly for rural women who play a major role in household water provision and waste \nmanagement. About 70% of urban drinking water supply in the county comes from groundwater \nthat has been contaminated and/or diminished because of overexploitation, resulting in many dry \nwells. The city\u2019s groundwater quality is far below national standards.10 Poor access to safe water \n \n7  Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and Intergovernmental Technical Panel on Soils. 2015. \nStatus of the World\u2019s Soil Resources: Main Report, Chapter 6\u2014Global Soil Status, Processes and Trends.

Coronavirus disease pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic that began in early 2020 has \namplified the linkages between biodiversity, public health, and ecosystem-dependent global \nsupply chains. The COVID-19 pandemic is being contained in the PRC but remains a risk, \nparticularly for rural areas such as Xichuan County, which lacks reliable access to improved water \nand sanitation including wastewater treatment; and where ecological services are critical for \nsafeguarding human and environmental health, both locally and regionally. There is growing \nrecognition of the need for measures to prevent the spread of infectious diseases in the future, \nand rural vitalization is a key part of the PRC\u2019s recovery from COVID-19; the project is committed \nto contributing to that goal. \n \n12.  Development planning. Poverty, declining water quality, and ecosystem degradation are \nthe three most prominent development challenges in Xichuan County. Considering the complex \nnexus among these three key problems in the county and their potential threats to water quality \nand quantity in Danjiangkou Reservoir, XCG urgently needs to adopt an holistic approach to \ndevelopment planning that leverages benefits from individual sector interventions and develops \nsynergies in support of broader development. To do so, XCG needs to improve its water \nmanagement planning and strategy development as well as enhance institutional coordination \nand technical capacity for more effective implementation. Located in a less-developed region in \nthe middle of Yangtze River basin, the county can demonstrate an environmentally sustainable \ngrowth model that can be replicated in other parts of the river basin, the PRC, and beyond. \n \n13.  Strategic fit. The project will promote green development through investment in natural \ncapital in the rural areas. This is consistent with (i) the PRC\u2019s Fourteenth Five-Year Plan, 2021\u2013\n2025,11 which aims to reduce the divide between rural and urban areas; (ii) the PRC\u2019s Rural \nVitalization  Strategy  for  2018\u20132022  (footnote  1),  which  promotes  poverty  reduction,  rural \ndevelopment, and green and inclusive growth; (iii) Strategy 2030 of the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB),12 which places a heavy emphasis on ADB providing value addition through greater \nintegration of knowledge in its financial support, prioritizes operations in the areas of tackling \nclimate change, building disaster resilience, and enhancing environmental sustainability, and  \nencourages upper middle-income countries to strengthen institutions and share knowledge; and \n(iv)  ADB\u2019s  country  partnership  strategy  for  the  PRC,  2021\u20132025, 13  which  emphasizes \nenvironmentally  sustainable  development,  and  climate  change  adaptation.  It  is  in  line  with \nSustainable Development Goals 1, 5, 6, and 13.14  \n \nB.  Project Description \n14.

Value Added by ADB \n19.  Value addition by ADB assistance. The project has introduced special and innovative \nfeatures,  including  (i)  an  integrated  development  approach  for  an  economically  poor, \nenvironmentally sensitive, and ecologically critical region; (ii) research and development on soil \nand water conservation at watershed scale with the provision of proper monitoring and evaluation, \nincluding the use of advanced technology such as remote sensing (via drone and satellite) to \nmonitor soil degradation and plant health; (iii) locally suitable peripheral rainwater harvesting to \nprovide gravity flow drip irrigation, reduce energy consumption, and reduce water induced soil \nerosion; (iv) smart drip irrigation with soil moisture measurements, automated fertilizer mixtures, \nand mobile phone-based irrigation demand management; and (v) high-level technologies in utility \nservices, including use of global positioning system-based mobile phone applications to track and \ntrace  the  solid  waste collection  in  Xichuan  County.  Additionally,  ADB  will  support  XCG  in \nimplementing the project in a gender-responsive and socially inclusive manner, importantly \nthrough a community-based approach. The project\u2019s innovative features and value addition, which \nare aimed at promoting regional public goods, will be disseminated through knowledge products \nand knowledge-sharing events (para. 15) and therefore, can be replicated in other poor rural \nareas in the PRC and ADB\u2019s developing member countries. \n \n20.  Nature-positive recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. The project will contribute to \nholistic development in the region by prioritizing investments in natural capital conservation and \nrestoration  and  shifting  traditional  investments  toward  valuing  of  nature  and  reduction  of \ninequalities in rural areas. Rural vitalization is a key part of the nature-positive approach to \nrecovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, aimed at building resilience in the region in the short-, \nmedium-, and long-term. The nature-positive approach focuses on investments in natural capital, \nincluding soil and water conservation and ecosystem restoration.

Implementation Arrangements \n \n26.  The XCG will be the executing agency. The project management office (PMO) has been \nestablished  in  county  vice-governor\u2019s  office,  which  will  facilitate  the  project  implementation \nthrough coordination among five implementing agencies. The implementation arrangements are \nsummarized in Table 3 and described in detail in the PAM (footnote 21). \n \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nImplementation period  October 2021\u2013September 2026 \nEstimated completion date  30 September 2026 \nEstimated loan closing date  31 March 2027 \nManagement \n(i)  Oversight body  Xichuan project leading group chaired by executive vice-governor of XCG \nHenan Development and Reform Commission, Henan Provincial Finance \nDepartment, and Xichuan County Finance Department  \n(ii)  Executing agency  XCG \n(iii)  Key implementing  Xichuan Water Affairs Bureau, Xichuan Housing and Urban\u2013Rural Construction \nagencies  Bureau, Xichuan Agriculture and Rural Bureau, Xichuan Tourism Service Center, \nand Ecology and Environment Protection Bureau \n(iv)  Implementation units  Project management office in XCG, and project implementation units in Xichuan \nWater Affairs Bureau, Xichuan Housing and Urban\u2013Rural Construction Bureau, \nXichuan Agriculture and Rural Bureau, Xichuan Tourism Service Center, and \nEcology and Environment Protection Bureau (30 staff) \nProcurement  OCB (international)  1 contract  \u20ac1,198,199   \n($1,403,930) \nOCB (national)  35 contracts  \u20ac293,781,801   \n ($344,224,049) \nCommunity participation  2 contracts  \u20ac247,504   \nprocurement   ($290,000) \nConsulting services  ICS  14 person-months, 4 contracts  \u20ac90,000   \n ($105,453) \nCQS  36 person-month, 2 contracts  \u20ac256,000   \n($299,955) \nQCBS  178 person-months, 1 contract  \u20ac1,622,000   \n ($1,900,497) \nRetroactive financing  Advance  contracting  and  retroactive  financing  will  apply  to  the  recruitment  of \nand/or advance contracting  consultants and procurement of civil works packages.

DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical \n \n27.  The domestic feasibility studies are technically sound, meet international standards, and \nprovide sufficient information on the design\u2019s feasibility. Licensed domestic design institutes \nprepared  all  project  components\u2014considering  local  geophysical,  socioeconomic,  and \nhydrometeorological conditions, as well as anticipated climate change risks (rated medium) in \naccordance with the PRC design guidelines and local regulations. The project considered the \n ", "9 \ntechnical and economic viability of alternative solutions such as (i) a centralized or decentralized \nwater supply system, (ii) centralized or distributed wastewater treatment plants, (iii) drip or \nsprinkler irrigation, and (iv) concrete lining or gabion wall for erosion control. The studies included \na demand projection to determine the size and scale of each project component and optimization \nof timescales for project implementation. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial Viability \n28.  The economic analysis indicated that the project is economically viable, with an overall \neconomic internal rate of return of 11.9% and an economic net present value of CNY492.4 million. \nThe analysis also confirmed the economic viability of all project components. Sensitivity analysis \nindicated that project viability is robust even under the negative scenarios examined, such as an \nincrease in investment costs, a reduction in benefits, and an increase in O&M costs. The full \neconomic benefits of the project are expected to be significantly higher, as some effects, such as \nhealth and ecological benefits, are not easily quantifiable. \n29.  The financial analysis was conducted in accordance with ADB guidelines.24 This included \nfinancial viability assessments for revenue-generating project components, an assessment of the \nproject\u2019s financial sustainability, and an assessment of the financial capacity of the XCG (para. 30). \nFour revenue-generating project components:(i) the forestry and fruit farming development project \nsmart irrigation system; (ii) provision of cold storage facilities; (iii) Xichuan County food waste and \nmunicipal sludge collaborative treatment center; and (iv) Xichuan County water supply for urban and \nrural areas\u2014are financially viable, with financial internal rates of return for the project components of \n1.11% to 5.99%, which compares favorably to the weighted average cost of capital of 0.45% to 0.54%. \n \nC.  Sustainability \n30.  A financial sustainability assessment of XCG considered the fiscal impact of incremental \nrecurrent costs, including O&M expenditures and debt service for the project. The analysis \nconfirmed the financial sustainability of the project. XCG derives on average 50% of its recurrent \nbudget  from  Henan  Provincial  Government  (HPG),  which  is  a  moderate  risk  to  financial \nsustainability. However, the project agreement includes a covenant for adequate O&M funding to \nbe allocated by XCG for the project facilities. Further, adequate consulting services will be \nprovided during project implementation for institutional and capacity building for environmental \nmanagement and enhanced asset management and O&M of the project facilities. \n \nD.  Governance \n31.  The financial management assessment of XCG was conducted in accordance with ADB \nguidelines.25 The assessed pre-mitigation financial management risk is moderate mainly because \nof XCG\u2019s lack of familiarity with ADB\u2019s financial management policies and procedures. The \nassessment recommended a time-bound action plan, which XCG will implement during the project \nimplementation period, to mitigate the identified financial management risks. This will ensure \ncapacity of the executing agency\u2019s financial staff, accounting and reporting systems, and internal \nand external audit arrangements will be adequate. Further, XCG\u2019s financial management capacity \nunder  the  guidance  of  HPG,  which  is  familiar  with  development  partner-funded  project \nmanagement, will be supported for effective financial management of the project.  \n \n24 ADB. 2019.

Manila is included in \nFinancial Management Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "10 \n32.  The procurement risk assessment confirmed that the XCG, supported by the PMO, has \nadequate capacity to implement ADB\u2019s Procurement Policy (2017, as amended from time to time) \nand Procurement Regulations for ADB Borrowers (2017, as amended from time to time), despite its \nlack of experience with internationally financed projects. All procurement will be organized through \nan experienced procurement agent. The project management and capacity development consultants \nwill  provide  procurement  and  contract  management  support  to  the  PMO  throughout  project \nimplementation. Value for money will be achieved by applying open competitive bidding with national \nadvertisement, the single-stage: one envelope (1S1E) bidding procedure, and lowest-evaluated \nsubstantially responsive bid evaluation modality for majority of packages. This approach can be used \nbecause the civil engineering and goods procurement requirements of the project are noncomplex \nin nature and can be fully supplied by the domestic market, promoting economy and efficiency in \nprocurement.  One  high-level  technology  package  (Support  and  Business  Application  System \nDevelopment and Integration) will be procured through open competitive bidding with international \nadvertisement and the use of a scoring system for evaluation to increase the focus on quality and \nsolicit offers from an expanded pool of potential suppliers. \n \n33.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government, XCG, Xichuan Water Affairs Bureau, Xichuan Housing and Urban\u2013Rural \nConstruction Bureau, Xichuan Agriculture and Rural Bureau, Xichuan Tourism Service Center, \nand the Ecology and Environment Protection Bureau. The specific policy requirements and \nsupplementary measures are described in the PAM (footnote 21). \n \nE.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n34.  Poverty and social. The project is classified as a general intervention for poverty reduction. \nThe project team, in close coordination with XCG, undertook the poverty and social analysis based \non stakeholder consultations and socioeconomic surveys. It indicated that about 605,080 people, \nincluding 89,921 poor or low-income people, will directly benefit from the project. Among them: (i) \n382,827 will benefit from improved water supply; (ii) 471,485 will benefit from improved river \nmanagement, soil and water conservation, and wastewater and solid waste management; and (iii) \n16,491 will benefit from rural infrastructure, smart irrigation, and cold storage facilities. The project \nwill provide 1,900 skilled and 3,531 non-skilled employment opportunities to local residents. XGC \nprepared a social development action plan based on the poverty and social analysis, with specific \ntargets for the poor and low-income people. XCG consulted local residents and other stakeholders \nduring the project preparation, which will be continued during the implementation of the project. \n \n35.  Gender.  The  project  is  classified  effective  gender  mainstreaming,  following  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines for Gender Mainstreaming Categories of ADB Projects.26 Women comprise 47.4% of \nthe total population in the project area. Women are experiencing (i) extra burden with agricultural \nand household works, (ii) low levels of education and skills, and limited employment opportunities, \n(iii) difficulties associated with water security, and (iv) low participation and leadership in public \naffairs. The project will ensure that women will participate in and benefit from improved services, \nskills training, and employment under the project, including through community mobilization. A \ngender action plan has been prepared based on gender analyses to ensure gender equality, \ncovering the following key measures and targets for women: (i) participation in decision-making, \nwith  at  least  40%  women  participants;  (ii)  leadership  training  for  women\u2019s  committees  on \nwatershed  management  in  one  pilot  village;  (iii)  engagement  of  women\u2019s  committees  in \ngovernance  of  beautiful  village  initiatives  in  four  pilot  villages;  (iv)  priority  employment \nopportunities, with at least 25% of skilled jobs and at least 35% of non-skilled jobs; and (v) \n \n26 ADB. 2012.

Key gender targets have also been included in the design and monitoring framework. \n \nF.  Safeguards \n \n36.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project\u2019s safeguard \ncategories are as follows.27 \n \n37.  Environment  (category  B).  An  initial  environmental  examination,  including  an \nenvironmental management plan (EMP) and grievance redress mechanism, has been prepared \nand disclosed on ADB\u2019s website on 5 October 2020. The initial environmental examination is \nbased  on  the  domestic  feasibility  studies  and  environmental  assessments,  site  visits,  and \nstakeholder consultations. XCG, through the PMO, will be responsible for implementation of and \ncompliance with the EMP. Qualified full-time environment officers will be assigned to the PMO \nand project implementation units, and a training program has been included in the EMP. The \nproject will contribute to environmental benefits, including improved water quality, flood control, \nand solid waste management. Risks include the potential release of contaminants from polluted \nsediments during dredging works, short-term construction impacts (e.g., dust and noise), and the \nuse  of  agricultural  chemicals  during  operations.  The  outbreak  of  the  COVID-19  pandemic \npresents a risk to the health of workers and residents. Measures to address these risks have been \nincorporated in the EMP and include procedures for the treatment and disposal of dredge spoil, \nwastewater, solid waste, and sludge; riverbank rehabilitation; and preparation of a COVID-19 \nhealth and safety plan based on best practice guidelines. \n \n38.  Involuntary resettlement (category B). The project will permanently occupy 2,800.73 \nmu of land, of which 491.09 mu is existing state-owned land and 2,309.64 mu is collective land \nthat will be acquired permanently.28 A total of 728 households with 2,815 persons will be affected \nby  the  project\u2019s  permanent  land  acquisition,  and  four  households  with  eight  persons  will \nexperience more than 10% income loss because of land acquisition. The project will not involve \nany physical house relocation. A total of 1,841.6 mu of land will be used temporarily during \nconstruction, including 1,146.42 mu of state-owned land and 695.18 mu of collective land \n(affecting  151  households  with  604  persons).  XCG  has  prepared  a  resettlement  plan  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) and applicable laws and regulations \nof the PRC. The plan includes adequate measures for compensation and rehabilitation of affected \npeople. The plan is based on surveys and consultations with affected people during project \npreparation and will be further updated through detailed measurement surveys and consultations \nduring  project  implementation.  A  grievance  redress  mechanism  has  been  established  and \nincorporated into the resettlement plan. Due diligence was conducted on existing facilities, \nconfirming that there are no outstanding and legacy issues from prior land acquisition.  There are \nno outstanding issues on existing leases; and a land use rights transfer framework has been \nprepared for voluntary land use agreements to be completed during project implementation. XCG \nhas the capacity to implement domestically funded projects, and its capacity to implement the \nresettlement  plan  in  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009)  will  be \nstrengthened by the project consultants. An external agency will be engaged to monitor and \nevaluate the implementation of the resettlement plan and submit semiannual reports to ADB. \n \n39.  Indigenous peoples (category C). The project is not expected to impact distinct and \nvulnerable communities of indigenous peoples or ethnic minorities. There are Hui, Man, and \n \n27 ADB. Safeguard Categories. \n28 A mu is a Chinese unit of measurement (1 mu = 666.67 square meters). \n ", "12 \nMongolian ethnic minority populations that account for 0.64% of the total population in the project \narea, and no significant differences exist between them and Han residents in terms of language \nand socioeconomic conditions.
