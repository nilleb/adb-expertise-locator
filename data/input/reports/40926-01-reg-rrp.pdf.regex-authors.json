PROPOSAL  \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \nequity investment in Kula Fund II Limited (the Fund) of up to $5 million or 25% of the Fund\u2019s \ntotal share capital, whichever is less. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) shall not be the \nsingle largest investor in the Fund. \n \nII.  INVESTMENT RATIONALE AND DEVELOPMENT IMPACT \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION HAS BEEN DELETED] \n \nA.  Background \n1.  More Steady Economic Growth \n2.  Over the past 5 years, Pacific island economies have improved after times of severe \npolitical instability in Papua New Guinea (PNG), Fiji Islands, and Solomon Islands; and the \nglobal economic downturn in 2002\u20132003. Real gross domestic product (GDP) growth in the \nregion  averaged  2.1%  over  1999\u20132003,  notwithstanding  prolonged  contractions  in  the \neconomies of PNG, Solomon Islands, and Vanuatu. Consumer price inflation was also kept in \ncheck between 1999 and 2003, averaging 4.6%, even though inflation in some economies \nremained or accelerated into double digits.   \n \n3.  The  combination  of  moderate  inflation  and  steady  growth  is  attributable  to  various \nfactors, including the following. \n \n(i)  Normalization of political and economic activity following the coup d\u2019\u00e9tat in the Fiji \nIslands, and rapid reconstruction following the collapse of political institutions and \nthe economy in the Solomon Islands. However, recent riots in the Solomon \nIslands show the continuing vulnerability.  \n(ii)  Improving  economic  and  political  conditions  in  PNG  following  the  enhanced \nengagement  of  multilateral  development  institutions  and  the  Government  of \nAustralia. \n(iii)  Gradual improvements in fiscal discipline in some countries and an increased \nfocus on the quality of public expenditure and rationalization of the public sector \nin those countries.  \n(iv)  Robust  recovery  in  world  commodity  and  cash  crop  prices,  boosting  export \nrevenues for minerals, timber, palm oil, copra, cocoa, vanilla, and squash.  \n \n4.  Although the investment climate in the Pacific islands will remain challenging for the \nforeseeable future, gradual improvements in the economic and political landscape of many \ncountries in the region is expected to create opportunities for investors. In the two largest \neconomies, PNG and Fiji Islands, economic growth will be underpinned by strong foreign direct \ninvestment inflows in the mining, energy, and tourism sectors. Growth prospects in the smaller \neconomies  will  largely  depend  on  agricultural  performance  and  the  development  of  niche \nsubsectors, such as organic farming and ecotourism, in addition to more general tourism.  \n \n2.  Shortage of Risk Capital for Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises (SMEs)   \n5.  In  order  to  exploit  the  opportunities  generated  by  these  broadly  stable  economic \nconditions, many SMEs in the Pacific islands require medium-to-long-term capital financing. \nHowever,  SMEs  throughout  the  region  are  constrained  by  low  turnover,  rudimentary \nadministrative and managerial practices, and an acute shortage of risk capital.  ", "2     \n \n6.  In the Pacific region, the commercial banking sector is almost exclusively dominated by \ntwo Australian institutions, ANZ Bank and Westpac. Commercial banks largely focus on the \nretail sector through basic deposit-taking and lending activities and on the few large project \nfinance opportunities that arise. Domestic financial sectors provide only a minimal range of \nbanking services; access to credit for local entrepreneurs is limited; and high interest rate \nspreads  reflect  high  transaction  costs  and  risk  premiums,  and  inefficiencies  in  financial \nintermediation. There has been little appetite to complement lucrative retail finance products \nwith higher-risk unsecured commercial loan products. SMEs struggle to qualify for traditional \ndebt  financing  because  few  have  adequate  collateral  required  to  meet  commercial  banks\u2019 \nstringent lending criteria in the context of an ineffective legal and technical collateral framework.  \n \n7.  PNG and the Fiji Islands are the two major countries in the Fund\u2019s investment region and \nthe majority of the Fund\u2019s capital will be invested in these two countries. In PNG, bank lending \nto the private sector has remained stagnant since the early 1990s, although it has increased \nsomewhat in the last 1\u20132 years.1 The credit policies of the formal financial sector are cautious. \nThe banks favor larger clients (many of which are subsidiaries of foreign firms) and short-term \ninvestments, particularly in the form of government securities. At the end of 2004, short-term \ngovernment securities constituted 40% of the asset base of commercial banks. Bank lending is \nfurther hindered by the difficulties of land registration and low population density, which increase \ntransaction costs and security concerns.  \n \n8.  In the Fiji Islands, the capital markets are underdeveloped, even though they are deeper \nthan those of any of the other Pacific region\u2019s economies. The South Pacific Stock Exchange in \nSuva, Fiji Islands, is the only stock exchange of note in the region. There are a number of \nissues hampering the financial sector\u2019s ability to finance investment and encourage savings, \nsuch as high interest rate spreads; poor intermediation of remittances; and low levels of credit to \nthe private sector, which only amounts to about 23% of GDP.2 In addition, lack of adequate \ncollateral  for  securing  loans  and  the  inability  of  native  landowners  to  mortgage  their  land \nbecause of customary tenure hinders financial intermediation and SMEs\u2019 access to credit.  \n \n9.  When commercial banks lend to SMEs, they often take equity risk for a debt-like return \nbecause  of  the  absence  of  acceptable  collateral.  There  are  no  providers  of  capital  to \ncomplement the provision of financing with value-addition; managerial mentoring; and strategic \ndecision-making, which is needed to mitigate risks and obtain risk-adjusted returns from equity \nfinance, in particular in a market with little managerial and operational sophistication. The result \nis that there are few and, in some cases, no sources of risk capital available to SMEs in the \nregion.  \n \nB.  Challenges and Opportunities  \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION HAS BEEN DELETED] \n \n1.  Building on Investment Experience in the Pacific Islands  \n10.  Given the overall lack of risk capital, and the past investment experience of Pacific \nCapital Partners Limited (the Fund Manager) gained by investing and divesting Kula Fund I, the \nproposed Fund will be well placed to take advantage of some of the more attractive investment \nopportunities in the marketplace. The Fund plans to invest in the types of companies that could \nbenefit significantly from the hands-on involvement and guidance that the Fund Manager can \nprovide. The Fund Manager will build on its lessons learned in SME investment in the Pacific \n                                                 \n1 Economist Intelligence Unit. 2005. Country Report. Papua New Guinea. London. \n2 ADB. 2006. Private Sector Assessment for Fiji Islands. Manila.  ", "    3\nislands to actively assist investee companies in developing business plans, improving capital \nstructures,  and  implementing  international  standards  of  corporate  governance.  Hands-on \nassistance will also be provided in improving management information systems and human \nresource development, which will help to produce solid returns to investors while providing \ninvestee companies with a strong foundation for sustainable growth and development. In many \ncases, the transition to more professional management should enable portfolio companies to \nimprove their performance and enhance their value to potential purchasers, thus improving the \nFund\u2019s chances of achieving profitable exits. \n \n11.  A key feature of the proposed Fund is that it will be able to mobilize the relationships it \nhas established in the Pacific region since 1997 to generate investment opportunities. With \nteam members already located in the Pacific region, the Fund Manager has begun to generate \na pipeline of potential transactions for the Fund, mobilizing its long-standing network of contacts \nwith senior corporate executives, financial intermediaries, and service providers, such as legal \nand accounting professionals. Potential investment opportunities for the Fund have arisen in \nagribusiness,  tourism,  fast-moving  consumer  goods,  manufacturing,  and  business-process \noutsourcing.  The  Fund  will  be  able  to  immediately  pursue  a  number  of  these  potential \nopportunities  after  its  establishment,  which  will  minimize  the  period  where  the  Fund  pays \nmanagement fees without generating returns from investments. This is crucial for achieving a \npositive net return in this challenging environment.  \n \nC.  Development Impact  \n \n1.  Development Objectives  \n \n12.  The Fund will build on Kula Fund I\u2019s experience and role in contributing to private sector \ndevelopment in the Pacific region. The three case studies show the important contributions that \nKula Fund I made in (i) improving access to finance, (ii) private-sector-led development, (iii) \nintroducing best practices in corporate governance, (iv) generating employment, (v) providing \nbasic services such as access to health care and education, and (vi) at a more overarching level, \nimproving living standards through poverty reduction of investee companies\u2019 employees.  \n \n13.  Specifically, by providing financing for Kula Fund II, ADB intends to achieve the following \ndevelopmental objectives. \n \n(i)  Capacity building in a narrow financial sector. The establishment of regional \noffices and cooperation with financial professionals in remote islands will help to \nfoster  local  SME  investment  skills.  The  Aureos  investment  philosophy  and \ninfrastructure  are  particularly  effective  because  they  combine  decentralized \ndecision-making  and  active  support,  training,  and  quality  control  from \nheadquarters.  \n \n(ii)  Diversify sources of finance available for SMEs. Given the stringent collateral \nrequirements of banks in the Pacific islands, the inclusion of equity finance will be \ncritically important. It enables SMEs to buy fixed assets, use them as collateral \nfor commercial bank loans, and leverage their expansion. This leverage effect \ncreates a dynamic process promoting SMEs\u2019 graduation to larger enterprises, \nwhich results in increased employment and productivity. \n \n(iii)  Building  sustainable  private  sector  companies.  The  Fund  Manager  will \ncontribute to the development of sustainable SMEs by providing management \nadvice to SMEs in financial planning, business expansion strategies, human \n ", "4     \nresource  development,  and  implementation  of  international  standards  of \ncorporate governance. \n \n(iv)  Create sustainable private sector jobs. Sustainable employment in the Pacific \nislands will be created through the Fund\u2019s investee companies. \n \n(v)  Support  a  fund  manager  with  a  track  record  in  the  Pacific  islands.  By \nmanaging Kula Fund I, the investment team has gained critically important local \ninvestment experience and created a network in the Pacific islands, which can be \nused to source investments and build sustainable SMEs in the region.  \n \n14.  In addition to the Fund\u2019s direct impact on employment and economic growth, the Fund \nwill contribute to the development of effective regulatory and legal environments in the target \ncountries. The Fund will be required to collect consistent information on regulatory issues that \ntheir SME portfolio companies encounter in the Pacific region. This information will be reported \non a regular basis to PARD to support the formulation of a regulatory framework conducive to \nentrepreneurial SMEs.     \n \nD.  Measuring Development Effectiveness \n15.  ADB\u2019s  Private  Sector  Operations  Department  (PSOD)  and  Operations  Evaluation \nDepartment (OED) continue to formulate guidelines for implementing Good Practice Standards \n(GPS) for Evaluation of Private Sector Investment Operations, which were prepared by the \nEvaluation Cooperation Group3 of the multilateral development banks. These GPS cover the \nroles of the independent evaluation department and the private sector department itself, the \nevaluation  dimensions  for  private  sector  operations,  the  nature  of  annual  reporting,  and \ndissemination of reports and lessons. According to the GPS, the three principal dimensions for \nprivate  sector  evaluation  are  (i)  development  outcome,  (ii)  investment  profitability  for  the \ninstitution, and (iii) operational effectiveness. PSOD will measure the expected development \noutcome of this Fund at the fund and sub-project levels, as well as beyond the Fund, by \nmonitoring certain performance measures throughout the life of the Fund. The performance \nmeasures are grouped into three key areas.  \n(i)  Business  performance.  The  extent  to  which  the  Fund  has  reached  its \nobjectives in terms of the overall profitability and commercial viability of the Fund \nand subprojects. \n \n(ii)  Economic sustainability. The effects of the Fund and subprojects on the DMC\u2019s \neconomy, and the associated benefits and costs. On one hand, these measures \nassess the extent to which the Fund improved the allocation of resources and \nprovision of financial services to viable private enterprises. On the other, these \nmeasures evaluate whether the subprojects directly generated positive effects on \nthe local economy.  \n \n(iii)  Private  sector  development.  The  impact  of  the  Fund  on  private  sector \ndevelopment beyond the Fund itself and its immediate stakeholders, e.g., the \nFund\u2019s contribution to the growth of viable financial institutions and financial \nmarkets development. \n \n                                                 \n3 The Evaluation Cooperation Group was formed by the multilateral development banks to design common evaluation \nstandards for private sector operations. The group\u2019s work is ongoing and some aspects of the present evaluation \nframework might change to correspond to best practices. ", "    5\n \nIII.  THE FUND \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION HAS BEEN DELETED] \n \nA.  Fund Objectives  \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION HAS BEEN DELETED] \n \n16.  Kula Fund II will invest in SMEs in the Pacific islands. At least 80% of the Fund\u2019s \ninvestments will be invested in enterprises in the Cook Islands, Fiji Islands, Kiribati, Marshall \nIslands, Federated States of Micronesia, Nauru, PNG, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu, \nPalau, and Vanuatu. The remaining 20% may be invested in enterprises based elsewhere in the \nPacific region,4 which have, or are expected to have, significant operations and/or create \neconomic benefit within DMCs of the Pacific region. While a significant proportion of committed \ncapital is expected to be invested in PNG and the Fiji Islands, the Fund\u2019s overarching objective \nis to build a portfolio diversified by geography, and no more than 60% of the Fund\u2019s total \ncommitments can be invested in enterprises in the Fiji Islands and PNG. \n \n17.  The Fund will generally take significant minority stakes with board representation and \nthe right to participate in or influence the conduct of management in its portfolio companies. The \nsize of the Fund\u2019s investment in portfolio companies will range from $100,000 to $3 million. The \nFund will pursue the following investment opportunities: \n \n(i)  expansions of companies with promising growth prospects that are unable to \nsecure financing from traditional sources such as commercial banks; \n(ii)  consolidations and associated divestments of discrete business segments as \nconglomerates refocus on core competences; \n(iii)  management  buyouts,  as  local  managers  seek  to  take  control  of  recently-\ndivested or newly-privatized companies; \n(iv)  start-ups  and  early  stage  transactions,  particularly  in  smaller  Pacific  islands, \nwhere local managers are able demonstrate a sound track record;  \n(v)  growth  in  agricultural  output  and  exports  in  response  to  improved  world \ncommodity prices and the implementation of agricultural development policies \nfocusing on niche agriculture, organic and specialty products; and \n(vi)  strong growth in the tourism sector underpinned by a perception, particularly \namong Australian and New Zealand holiday-makers, that terrorist attacks are \nless likely in Pacific island destinations than in other regions. \n \n18.  The Fund\u2019s equity commitments may be accompanied by secured debt, mezzanine debt, \nand/or  quasi-equity  instruments  such  as  convertible  debt  and  preference  shares.  Such \ninvestment structures offer current income and mitigate the risks related to exiting from portfolio \ncompanies in this challenging environment.  \n \nB.  Fund Management  \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION HAS BEEN DELETED] \n \n19.  Fund Manager. The Fund will be managed by Pacific Capital Partners Limited (the Fund \nManager), a company with limited liability and incorporated under the laws of Vanuatu, and a \nwholly-owned  subsidiary  of  Aureos  Capital  Limited  (Aureos),  a  company  incorporated  with \nlimited liability under the laws of Mauritius. Aureos is a global manager of SME private equity \n                                                 \n4 Including Australia and New Zealand.  \n ", "6     \nfunds. Aureos was born out of the former Commonwealth Development Capital (CDC) Funds \nGroup, pioneers of private equity in many of the emerging markets in the SME sector. (CDC\u2019s \nfirst  fund,  which  was  established  in  1989,  and  all  its  subsequent  funds,  were  exclusively \ninvested in developing countries.) When CDC spun out its private equity funds business in July \n2001, Aureos was established as a fund manager. Over 10 management companies, originally \nowned and managed by CDC, which in turn managed 14 SME venture capital country-specific \nfunds, were consolidated under the Aureos umbrella.   \n \n20.  Headquarters. The Aureos headquarters is in London and focuses solely on operating \nSME funds around the world. Aureos combines local presence with a global network, whereby \nthe central team fulfills the following functions:  \n \n(i)  central reporting function ensuring consistency, quality, and timeliness; \n(ii)  cross-fertilization  between  regional  teams  on  global  investment  themes,  and \nindustry-specific and market information; \n(iii)  compliance and procedural quality control; \n(iv)  overseeing the collection and implementation of lessons learned by providing a \ncentral point of information dissemination; \n(v)  training  and  dissemination  of  best  practices  in  investment  management  and \ncorporate governance; \n(vi)  exit assistance, particularly in finding foreign partners; and \n(vii)  cash control supervision. \n \n21.  Local Team. The local team carries out the main responsibilities of identifying potential \ninvestee companies, executing transactions, and monitoring and managing portfolio companies. \nThis local decision-making process is reflected in the Fund\u2019s incentive structure, which allocates \nmost of the performance-related rewards (carried interest) to the local team. The track record of \nAureos shows that its structure optimizes capacity building of local SME investment skills as it \ncombines  decentralized  decision  making  with  active  support  and  quality  control  from \nheadquarters. \n \n22.  Soon after the first closing, the Fund Manager will establish a new representative office \nin Suva, Fiji Islands, while maintaining its existing offices in Port Moresby, PNG, and Brisbane, \nAustralia\u2014which  will  be  the  regional  hub  office.  Back-office  support  will  be  provided  from \nBrisbane to produce standardized reporting and other management support so that investment \npartners can focus exclusively on investing and managing the Fund  \n \n23.  Technical Assistance. Taking from lessons learned (investing in the Pacific region is \ncostly and highly human resource intensive), Kula Fund II will have the benefit of TA funds from \nthe Australian Agency for International Development (AusAID), New Zealand\u2019s International Aid \n&  Development  Agency  (NZAID),  Australian  Business  Volunteers,  and  Centre  for  the \nDevelopment  of  Enterprise  of  the  European  Union.  AusAID  and  NZAID  have  committed \n$150,000 each per annum. TA support will take the form of capacity building, training, export \ndevelopment, and support in the due diligence process. By means of TA funding, the Fund will \nestablish  partnerships  with  local  business  councils,  chambers  of  commerce,  export \ndevelopment agencies, and other relevant organizations to increase awareness among local \nentrepreneurs of the benefits of risk capital as an asset class and to encourage them to grow \ntheir businesses through partnership. This strategy has proved very effective in other small \nisland contexts, notably the Caribbean and the Indian Ocean, as a means of stimulating organic ", "    7\ngrowth in SMEs and reducing the proclivity in many businesses towards costly borrowing and \ndebt accumulation.   \n \nIV.  ASSURANCES \n24.  Following the approval of the proposed investment by ADB\u2019s Board of Directors, ADB \nwill enter into suitable investment documentation and shall ensure that such documentation and \nother principal agreements relating to the Fund (including the management agreement between \nthe Fund and the Fund Manager) shall be on terms and conditions acceptable to ADB and \nincorporate all relevant ADB policies. \n \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n25.  I am satisfied that the proposed investment in Kula Fund II as described in this report \ncomplies with the Articles of Agreement of ADB and acting in the absence of the President, \nunder the provisions of Article 35.1 of the Articles of Agreement of ADB, I recommend that the \nBoard approve the investment in Kula Fund II of up to the lesser of $5 million or 25% of the \nFund\u2019s total share capital from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources. \n \n \n \n \nLiqun Jin \nVice President, Operations 1 \n \n \n \n7 June 2006 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "  8\n \n \n   A\np\nPERFORMANCE MEASURES FOR DEVELOPMENT OUTCOMES  pe\nn\nd\nix\nA.
