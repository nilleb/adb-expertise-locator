THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \npolicy-based grant to Tuvalu for the Strengthened Fiscal Sustainability Program.1 \n \n2.  The program aims to achieve a strengthened fiscal position for Tuvalu. It will provide \nfinancial  resources  to  implement  selected  reforms  under  the  third  and  final  phase  of  the \nGovernment of Tuvalu\u2019s current multiyear policy reform matrix (PRM) and will build on earlier \nreforms  supported  by  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  in  strengthening  (i)  public \nprocurement, (ii) public enterprises to improve their commercial orientation and support private \nsector development, and (iii) the fiscal buffer for improved fiscal sustainability.2 \n \nII.  THE PROGRAM \nA.  Rationale \n3.  Tuvalu is a fragile microstate and ADB\u2019s smallest member. It comprises nine low-lying \natolls with a total land area of 26 square kilometers. More than half the population of 10,800 \n(2013) reside on the main island of Funafuti\u2014an area of only 2.8 square kilometers. The \neconomy is small, narrowly based, and highly dependent on external sources of income and \nimports. The public sector accounts for around two-thirds of gross domestic product (GDP), and \nthere is limited scope for economic diversification or for private sector development. At its \nhighest point, Tuvalu is only 4.6 meters above sea level, making it highly vulnerable to climatic \nevents such as tropical storms and sea level rise. For example, Tuvalu experiences an average \nof two king tides per annum where sea level rise exceeds 3.2 meters, causing seawater to \ninundate homes, submerge roads, wash away crops, and contaminate freshwater supplies. In \nMarch 2015, tropical cyclone Pam\u2014a category 5 cyclone that coincided with a king tide\u2014\nbrought storm surges that inundated Tuvalu\u2019s low-lying atolls. Damage and loss to infrastructure \nand livelihoods resulting from this single event has been estimated at $15 million, or 34% of \nGDP.3 \n \n4.  Tuvalu\u2019s fiscal challenges. Under the circumstances, achieving fiscal sustainability is a \nchallenge  for  the  government.  It  requires  (i)  prudent  management  of  volatile  and  often \nunpredictable  revenue  sources,  including  fishing  license  fees,  licensing  royalties  for  the \ncommercial  use  of  the  \u201cdot.tv\u201d  internet  domain  name,  and  development  assistance;  (ii) \nexpenditure restraint at a long-term sustainable level, even if revenues are high in the short-\nterm; and (iii) the need to manage the fiscal risks from external economic shocks and regularly \noccurring climatic events such as natural disasters. \n \n5.  To help smooth revenue volatility, the Tuvalu Trust Fund (TTF) was created in 1987. In \nyears when the market value of the trust fund exceeds its real maintained value, the surplus is \ntransferred to the Consolidated Investment Fund (CIF) that the government can draw upon to \nfinance fiscal deficits.4 Following the 2008 global economic crisis, from 2009 to 2011 Tuvalu \nexperienced 3 consecutive years of economic contraction and low and declining returns on TTF \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The policy reform matrix phase 3 is in Appendix 4. \n3  World Bank. 2015.

An ADB investment \nproject to improve outer islands\u2019 port facilities, some of which were damaged during the tropical cyclone, is planned \nfor 2016. \n4  Government of Tuvalu. 2008. Agreement Concerning An International Trust Fund for Tuvalu. Funafuti. The \ntargeted CIF account balance is equivalent to 16% of the TTF\u2019s real maintained value (around 45% of GDP), which \nis estimated to cater for up to 4 years of continuous drawdowns absent of any new distributions from the TTF \naccount or budget. \n ", "2 \ninvestments.5 Consequently, there were no transfers from the TTF to the CIF from 2009 to \n2012. The downturn in the economy led to budget deficits of 22.5% of GDP in 2010 and 9.0% in \n2011 (compared to 1.5% in 2008 and 3.2% in 2009), which, in the absence of TTF transfers, \ncontributed to an unsustainable drawdown of funds from the CIF. By 2012, CIF cash reserves \nhad declined to 1.1% of GDP from 9.2% in 2008, putting at risk the government\u2019s ability to \nmaintain essential public services. At the same time, the government and its agencies entered \ninto new debt, predominantly to finance capital investment. External debt rose rapidly, peaking \nat 56% of GDP in 2010 against a target of 30% of GDP.6 \n \n6.  Government  response.  To  improve  the  fiscal  outlook,  ensure  prudent  fiscal \nmanagement, and prevent the accumulation of debt, in 2012, the government\u2014supported by \nADB, the governments of Australia and New Zealand, and the World Bank\u2014embarked on a \ncomprehensive reform program. The government adopted a medium-term PRM that outlines \nthree phases of time-bound reforms from 2012 to 2015, each one supported by development \npartners according to their areas of comparative advantage, and implemented through technical \nassistance  and  a  coordinated  program  of  budget  support.  The  PRM  explicitly  targets  a \nsustainable fiscal framework through reform actions in six areas: public financial management, \nfiscal policy, public administration, public enterprise performance and rationalization, and health \nand education management. Reforms achieved under phases 1 and 2 have triggered around $8 \nmillion in budget support from ADB and the other development partners.7 \n \n7.  Since 2012, the government has worked closely with development partners through the \nPRM to create strategies to keep fiscal deficits at sustainable levels (i.e., below 10% of GDP) \nand reduce debt to manageable levels. Fiscal management is tracked by government on a \nquarterly basis through the use of fiscal ratios, which provide a basis for benchmarking the \ngovernment\u2019s performance.8 Revenue and expenditure review committees were established in \n2012 to identify new sources of revenue and to advise the cabinet on strategies to control costs. \nGovernment revenues increased as a share of GDP from 56.6% in 2012 to 73.4% in 2014, \ndriven by strong fishing license revenues, which increased by 55% over the same period; \nimproved tax compliance following a tax audit of public enterprises; and an increase in the \nconsumption tax rate from 4% in 2012 to 7% in 2013.9 Government expenditures, however, \ngrew steadily from 2012 to 2014, driven largely by increased spending on the overseas medical \ntreatment and scholarships schemes and public sector wages. \n \n8.  Recognizing  these  three  long  standing  expenditure  pressures,  the  government  has \nformulated  clear  strategies  to  control  these  costs.  Increased  spending  on  the  government \nscholarship and overseas medical treatment schemes from 2010 to 2014 has been contained \nby PRM initiatives that were implemented between 2012 and 2014, specifically (i) halting of \ngovernment-funded  scholarships;  (ii)  reduction  in  the  accommodation  component  and \naccompanied  allowances  of  the  overseas  medical  treatment  scheme;  (iii)  building  up  of \ndomestic health service capacity; and (iv) exploration of more affordable options for overseas \ntreatment,  such  as  sending  heart  patients  to  India.  Outside  the  PRM,  the  government  is \nundertaking a phased series of civil service reforms to reduce the wage bill from 38% of \n                                                \n5  Real GDP growth was \u20132.3% in 2009, \u20131.4% in 2010, and \u20130.6% in 2011.

All actions under phases 1 and 2 have \nbeen achieved. \n8  The seven fiscal ratios are (i) tax revenue to GDP target of 20%; (ii) recurrent expenditure to GDP target of 60%; \n(iii) wages and salaries to domestic revenue target of 55%; (iv) Tuvalu Overseas Medical Treatment Scheme to \ndomestic revenue target of 6%; (v) Tuvalu Overseas Scholarship Scheme to domestic revenue target of 5%; (vi) \nprimary balance to GDP target of 11%; and (vii) net present value of public debt to GDP target of 30%.  \n9  Public Sector Management Sector Assessment (Summary): (accessible from the list of linked documents in \nAppendix 2). \n ", "3 \nrecurrent expenditure in 2014 to its target of 30% by 2018.  These reforms include (i) the \nadoption of performance management guidelines to support the performance appraisal and \nremuneration process in 2015; (ii) a wage freeze during 2015\u20132017; and (iii) the implementation \nof recommendations from a planned wage review in 2016\u20132017, which will focus on adoption of \na  wage-setting  mechanism  to  ensure  that  public  sector  wage  increases  are  in  line  with \nproductivity gains in the economy. \n \n9.  The rapid growth in revenue by 127% from 2011 to 2014 saw a return to substantial \nfiscal surpluses in 2012\u20132014. The government has used these surpluses to rebuild the CIF \nfrom $3.7 million in 2008 to $20.4 million in 2014, again providing an effective fiscal buffer.10 \nNevertheless, the Tuvalu economy is vulnerable to adverse climatic events, and the shock to \nthe economy from Cyclone Pam (para. 3) is already having a large impact on the fiscal balance, \nwith a budget deficit of 7.7% of GDP projected for 2015 and 9.5% for 2016 as reconstruction \ngets underway (Table 1). The reconstruction spending, financed by development partner grants \nbut also drawing on accumulated buffers, is expected to be largely completed by 2016. \n \nTable 1: Tuvalu Medium-Term Fiscal Framework, 2015\u20132017 \n(% of GDP, unless otherwise stated) \n2015  2015  2016  2017 \n  2012  2013  2014  Budget  Project  Project  Project \nTotal revenue and grants ($m)  23.5  30.9  34.9  40.3  35.4  37.1  35.4 \nRevenue  56.6  83.1  73.4  94.5  76.4  73.6  70.9 \nTaxes  15.0  19.0  17.8  19.0  18.3  17.5  16.8 \nNontax  41.5  64.1  55.6  75.3  58.1  56.1  54.1 \nGrants  27.2  24.6  48.3  24.9  39.7  22.1  20.5 \nTotal expenditure ($m)  20.9  23.3  30.2  40.6  47.7  41.5  30.7 \nCurrent expenditure  68.7  73.5  85.6  84.2  86.5  83.9  81.4 \nWages and salaries  31.9  32.2  35.6  38.0  36.4  34.4  32.8 \nCapital expenditures  5.7  7.7  9.2      35.9  37.3  21.3  8.9 \nReconstruction-related  \u2026  \u2026  \u2026  \u2026  18.5  11.9  \u2026 \nRecurrent balance  (12.2)  9.6  (12.1)  10.3  (10.1)  (10.3)  (10.5) \nOverall balance  8.4  27.5  35.0  (0.7)  (7.7)  (9.5)  1.1 \n$m  2.6  7.6  4.7  (0.3)  (12.5)  (4.4)  4.7 \nTTF distributions to CIF  \u2026  \u2026  15.2  5.1  19.4  4.5  4.5 \nDebt Indicators               \nGross public debt (incl.  43.0  41.1  56.9  \u2026  48.6  41.2  33.4 \nguarantees) \n$m  11.9  11.7  17.0  \u2026  15.3  13.6  11.4 \nof which: publicly guaranteed  2.7  2.7  2.5  \u2026  2.5  2.2  1.6 \ndebt \nof which: contingent liabilities a  4.6  4.0  10.3  \u2026  9.1  7.9  6.8 \nDebt Service b  11.2  11.6  12.8  13.2  13.2  12.5  10.7 \n\u2026 = data not available, ( ) = negative, $m = million dollars, CIF = Consolidated Investment Fund, GDP = \ngross domestic product, PPG = public and publicly guaranteed, TTF = Tuvalu Trust Fund. \na  Contingent liabilities are associated with a fishing joint ventures, of which 50 percent is owned by the \nNational Fishing Corporation of Tuvalu, a public enterprise. \nb  reflected as % of exports of goods and services. \nSources: Government of Tuvalu estimates; International Monetary Fund estimates; World Bank estimates; \nAsian Development Bank estimates. \n \n   \n                                                \n10 Government of Tuvalu.

The introduction of the Debt Risk Management and Mitigation Policy in 2009 provides \nclear guidelines on the contracting of debt. Since 2012, the government has completed and \npublished, as part of the government financial accounts, a stock-take of bank accounts and \ngovernment debt and guarantees, obtaining a comprehensive position of its net liabilities. A \nfishing joint venture with equal partnership between the National Fishing Corporation of Tuvalu, \na public enterprise, and a Taiwanese fishing company, took out commercial loans in 2009 and \n2014 without government guarantees to finance the building of fishing vessels\u2014a measure to \nimprove productivity of the local fishing industry and create local jobs. The joint venture has \nsubsequently  paid  off  the  2009  loan  through  profits  and  continues  to  make  subsequent \npayments to reduce their debt.  \n \n11.  To  protect  the  economy  against  external  shocks  while  laying  the  basis  for  more \nsustainable fiscal balances, the government is seeking to complete the program of reforms \nbegun with ADB support in 2012. Reforms include (i) completing ongoing public procurement \nreforms;  (ii)  improving  the  performance  of  public  enterprises  to  enhance  service  delivery, \nreducing contingent liabilities on the budget, and promoting private sector development; and (iii) \nimproving management and maintenance of the CIF buffer fund for long-term macroeconomic \nstability and economic self-sufficiency.  \n \n12.  Public  procurement  reforms.  The  program  completes  the  final  phase  of  public \nprocurement  reforms  begun  in  2012.  Public  procurement  has  been  a  high  priority  for  the \ngovernment, and its inclusion in the PRM has led to significant progress. From 2012 to 2014, \nADB supported the adoption of the 2012 National Procurement Policy, the Public Procurement \nAct 2013, and the Public Procurement Regulations 2014. These collectively regulate public \nprocurement to (i) maximize efficiency; (ii) achieve transparency in procurement proceedings; \n(iii) promote competition among suppliers, contractors, consultants, and non-consulting service \nproviders; (iv) provide for fair, equal, and equitable treatment of all those seeking to obtain \ncontracts with the government; and (v) promote public confidence in the integrity and fairness of  \nprocurement proceedings. The central procurement unit (CPU) was also established to ensure \nthat  government  resources  were  being  effectively  used  for  procurement  transactions,  and \nstandard bidding and other documents were developed for use by procurement practitioners. \nThe development of the CPU annual report and a centralized procurement website will help \nstrengthen public procurement governance. \n \n13.  Public enterprise rationalization. Tuvalu has eight public enterprises.11 With support \nfrom the Government of Australia and ADB, significant progress has been made in improving \nthe  policy  and  regulatory  framework  for  public  enterprises.  This  progress  includes  the \nestablishment of the Public Enterprise Reform and Monitoring Unit in 2009; the enactment of the \nPublic  Enterprises  Act  in  2009;  the  removal  of  politicians  and  civil  servants  from  public \nenterprise boards; the timely submission of audited annual reports to Parliament for all public \nenterprises; and the merger of the Tuvalu Philatelic Bureau, Tuvalu Post Office, and Tuvalu \nTravel Office into a single entity known as the Tuvalu Post and Travel Office. Government\u2019s \nefforts to pursue professional management options for the Vaiaku Lagi Hotel unfortunately failed \nin 2012 due to limited private sector interest. Nevertheless, more reforms are needed to enable \npublic enterprises to operate on a commercial basis, reduce the drain from ad hoc government \nsubsidies on the national budget, and attract greater private sector participation. Resolving the \ncross-liabilities of unpaid bills to public enterprises by the government and unpaid taxes to the \ngovernment by public enterprises would also help operational management. More work is also \nneeded  to  contract  out  selected  activities  of  the  Public  Works  Department  (PWD).  The \n                                                \n11 Tuvalu\u2019s public enterprises are the National Bank of Tuvalu, Development Bank of Tuvalu, National Fishing \nCompany of Tuvalu, Tuvalu Telecommunications Corporation, Vaiaku Lagi Hotel, Tuvalu Electricity Corporation, \nTuvalu Maritime Training Institute, and Tuvalu Post and Travel Office. \n ", "5 \nconstruction of capital works has typically involved the use of hired labor with procurement \ncontracts for the supply and delivery of building materials issued to the PWD. This practice is \nneither competitive nor transparent, and it extends the responsibility of the PWD beyond its \noriginal design and supervision role. The recent escalation of government-funded capital works \nand cyclone reconstruction efforts has prompted the government to develop a rationalization \nstrategy to improve the commercial and financial viability of the PWD.  \n \n14.  Transforming  the  Consolidated  Investment  Fund  to  build  a  fiscal  buffer.  The \ngovernment recognizes that much of the improvement in the fiscal balance during 2012\u20132014 \nwas due to temporary cyclical factors and nonrecurrent revenue.  The government is improving \nthe way it operates the CIF to better insulate the budget and the economy from external shocks. \nOn  the  advice  of  the  International  Monetary  Fund,  the  government  will  aim  to  achieve  a \n\u201cstructural fiscal balance\u201d\u2014a surplus of 0.5%\u20131.0% in 2016-2018\u2014with excess surpluses being \ntransferred  into  the  CIF.12 To  operate  as  a  fiscal  stabilization  fund,  changes  to  existing \naccumulation and withdrawal rules will be implemented to better regulate the use of the CIF and \nensure its replenishment. These changes will help avoid ad hoc fiscal tightening and the need to \nsearch for new, economically harmful revenue sources during economic downturns, and the \nfocus on the structural deficit will strengthen the foundation for policy setting. \n \n15.  ADB\u2019s  value  addition,  lessons  learned,  and  program  modality.  ADB\u2019s  strong \npartnership with the government through two policy-based lending operations in 2008 and 2012 \nand ongoing TA for substantial and highly sensitive public enterprise and procurement reforms \nhas enabled the government to undertake reforms that might otherwise be difficult to implement. \nIn a microstate such as Tuvalu, personal relationships and formal bureaucratic rules inevitably \nshaped government decisions when implementing hard reform actions.13 \n \n16.  The program builds on lessons from previous ADB programs in Tuvalu and elsewhere in \nthe Pacific, which highlight the importance of (i) maintaining a single, government-led, policy \nmatrix to enhance coordination and collaboration among development partners; (ii) using a \nsingle  tranche  modality  within  a  programmatic,  multiyear  approach  supported  by  several \npartners; (iii) implementing fewer reforms that have a large potential impact; and (iv) linking \ncapacity building TA support to PRM implementation, as capacity constraints can hamper the \ngovernment's ability to follow through on agreed reforms.14 The program is, therefore, a stand-\nalone policy-based grant operation that will focus on the implementation of the final phase of the \ncurrent PRM. ADB engagement post-PRM will be sustained through ongoing policy dialogue \nand follow-up TA to improve public sector management and greater investments in economic \ninfrastructure; for example, $3 million in disaster response financing will be provided through \nADB\u2019s Disaster Response Facility, which will build ports in the outer islands of Tuvalu. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n17.  The program is aligned with improved good governance, macroeconomic growth, and \nfiscal stability, as prioritized in Tuvalu\u2019s National Strategy for Sustainable Development, 2005\u2013\n                                                \n12 International Monetary Fund. 2014.

The program supports the final phase of \npublic procurement reforms begun in 2012.   \n(i)  Output 1.1. The first annual report of the CPU was published and approved by \nthe  cabinet  in  2015.  The  annual  report  details  procurement  transactions \nundertaken by the CPU on behalf of the government in 2014, key achievements \nand challenges faced during 2014, and outstanding actions that require further \nattention. The inclusion of a 2015 work plan enables timely action on individual \nprocurement transactions to avoid bunching at the end of the year. For better \nprocurement  planning,  future  work  plans  are  expected  to  be  prepared \nsimultaneously  with  the  budget,  as  the  two  are  closely  linked,  especially  in \nrespect of capital expenditure. The government plans to make this report publicly \navailable on the newly created centralized procurement website. \n(ii)  Output  1.2.  The  government\u2019s  procurement  website,  which  serves  as  a \ncentralized  resource  for  all  public  procurement-related  information,  was \ndeveloped and launched in 2015. This will enhance the government\u2019s ability to \nobtain better value for money and use scarce public resources more efficiently. It \nserves as a tool to (a) increase the government\u2019s accountability on its use of \npublic  funds,  (b)  enhance  the  fight  against  corruption,  and  (c)  increase \ntransparency and legal certainty. The website is also expected to help widen the \ninterest of overseas suppliers, including from Australia and New Zealand, and \npossibly generate more competition among bidders while generating some cost-\nsaving measures for Tuvalu. \n \n20.  Output  2:  Commercial  orientation  for  public  enterprises  and  private  sector \ndevelopment strengthened. The program supports the continuation of vital public enterprise \nreforms, focusing on efforts to attract private sector participation. \n(i)  Output 2.1. The Public Enterprise Reform Plan was developed and adopted by \nthe cabinet. The plan will guide government decision making towards enhancing \nthe commercial orientation and financial soundness of public enterprises, and \nclearly  define  and  cost  their  social  responsibilities.  This,  together  with \nstrengthened accounting and auditing practices, will enhance the transparency \nand accountability of public enterprises. \n(ii)  Output 2.2. The cabinet approved the sale of a concession for the Vaiaku Lagi \nHotel to a private operator, which is expected to raise operational standards and \nperformance, address maintenance issues, and improve guest facilities.  \n(iii)  Output 2.3. The cabinet approved a rationalization strategy for the PWD, which \nallows the contracting out of selected construction works such as building repairs. \nThe PWD rationalization strategy aims to promote the contracting out of capital \nconstruction to private sector contractors, including the purchase of required \n                                                \n15 Government of Tuvalu. 2004.

This will help build local private sector capacity to undertake \ncapital works in Tuvalu. \n \n21.  Output 3: Sustainability of the fiscal buffer strengthened. The program supports the \nstrengthening of CIF management rules to transform it into a fiscal stabilization fund. \n(i)  Output 3.1. The cabinet endorsed changes to the financial instructions under the \nPublic Finance Act to include detailed rules to guide, replenish, and regulate the \nuse of the CIF, ensuring that the target CIF savings balance shall be equivalent \nto  16%  of  the  maintained  value  of  the  TTF  and  regulated  through  a  CIF \ncontributions and savings plan.17 This reform will help transform the CIF into a \nfiscal stabilization fund that follows a clear rule of accumulation and withdrawal, \nwhereby  temporary  windfalls  from  external  revenue  sources  (e.g.,  fishing \nrevenues) are saved and can be drawn down when there is a revenue shortfall. \nDuring the national budget process, where the CIF balance at the start of the \nfollowing budget year is forecast to be at a level below the target CIF saving \nbalance, the finance minister will now be required to present to Parliament a CIF \ncontributions and savings plan as a component of the national budget. \n \nD.  Development Financing Needs \n22.  The government has requested a grant not exceeding $2.0 million from ADB\u2019s Special \nFunds resources to help finance the program. \n \n23.  ADB  is  basing  the  size  of  its  $2.0  million  grant  on  the  government\u2019s  financing \nrequirements and the cost of the government\u2019s reform program. Projections of budget financing \nrequirements (post-cyclone Pam) indicate a fiscal deficit of 7.7% of GDP in 2015 and 9.5% in \n2016, equivalent to about $7.9 million.  \n \n24.  The governments of Australia and New Zealand, and the World Bank, confirmed they \nwill provide parallel, collaborative grant cofinancing on the completion of their selected reforms \nunder the third phase of the PRM. The World Bank approved its second development policy \noperation  on  16  June  2015  following  completion  of  their  actions.  Approvals  from  the \nGovernments of Australia and New Zealand are expected in December 2015 once their actions \nare completed.18 The contributions from each partner are highlighted in Table 2. \n \nTable 2: Financing Plan  \nAmount  Share of Total \nSource  ($ million)  (%) \nAsian Development Bank      \nSpecial Funds resources (grant)  2.0  40.0 \nGovernment of Australia (grant)  1.1  22.0 \nGovernment of New Zealand (grant)  0.4  8.0 \nWorld Bank (grant)  1.5  30.0 \nTotal  5.0  100.0 \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n25.  Program management. The Ministry of Finance and Economic Development (MFED), \nas the executing agency, oversaw timely implementation of the agreed policy actions by the \n                                                \n17 Government of Tuvalu. 1991.

The outstanding actions, which are supported by the Governments of Australia and New \nZealand, are expected to be completed by 1 December 2015. \n ", "8 \nimplementing  agencies,  and  is  responsible for  program  administration,  disbursements,  and \nmaintaining all records. The MFED, through the CPU, was the implementing agency for output \n1. The MFED, through the Public Enterprise Monitoring Unit, (i) implemented output 2.1; (ii) \nacted as the joint implementing agency with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Environment, Trade, \nLabor and Tourism for output 2.2; and (iii) acted as the joint implementing agency with the \nMinistry of Public Utilities for output 2.3. The MFED was the sole implementing agency for \noutput 3. Ongoing TA (footnote 13) helped the government fulfill program conditions. ADB and \nother development partners supporting the PRM process agreed to a high-level coordination \nand  monitoring  mechanism  comprising  members  of  the  TTF  advisory  committee\u2014\nrepresentatives of the governments of Tuvalu, Australia, and New Zealand\u2014who will monitor \nthe implementation progress of the PRM. \n \n26.  Implementation period. The program is being implemented from 1 August 2014 to 30 \nOctober 2015, consistent with the government\u2019s medium-term fiscal framework and budget \ncycle. \n \n27.  Procurement  and  disbursement.  The  proceeds  of  the  grant  will  be  disbursed  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s simplification of disbursement procedures and related requirements for \npolicy-based grants.19 The proceeds will be used to finance the foreign exchange cost of items \nproduced and procured in ADB member countries, excluding items included in a list of ineligible \nitems  and  imports  financed  by  other  bilateral  and  multilateral  sources.20 Grant  proceeds \ndisbursed against imports will require a certificate from the government stipulating that the value \nof the total imports of Tuvalu, minus its imports from nonmember countries, ineligible imports, \nand imports financed under other official development assistance, is greater than the amount of \nthe grant expected to be disbursed during a particular year. ADB will have the right to audit the \nuse of the grant proceeds and to verify the accuracy of the government\u2019s certification. \n \n28.  Tranches. The grant will be provided in a single tranche and will be withdrawn upon \nsatisfaction of grant effectiveness conditions, i.e., fulfillment of all the actions in the program \npolicy matrix. Local currency generated from the grant will be directed to the government\u2019s bank \naccount with the National Bank of Tuvalu to allow provision of supplementary financing for the \n2016 national budget. \n \n29.  Program performance monitoring and evaluation. The government will monitor the \nimplementation and outcome of the program using a set of indicators and targets agreed \nbetween  the  government  and  ADB.  For  each  of  the  agreed  indicators,  progress  will  be \nmeasured  against the baselines  in  the  design  and  monitoring framework. The  responsible \nimplementing agencies will support the review of agreed actions to determine progress and \nidentify constraints. Because the outcome of the program will be felt beyond the period of its \nimplementation, the monitoring of the PRM will be carried out on a continuous basis by the TTF \nadvisory committee, and the information from this will be included in the program completion \nreport. \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n30.  The  program\u2019s  major  benefit  will  be  its  contribution  to  Tuvalu\u2019s  long-term  fiscal \nsustainability.  Fiscal  sustainability  will  in  turn help  maintain  macroeconomic  stability  in  the \ncountry and boost growth. Strengthened public sector management will also allow for improved \n                                                \n19 ADB. 1998.

Economic and Financial \n31.  Improving the government\u2019s expenditure management and reducing the demand on the \nbudget made by public enterprises will create fiscal space and allow the government to shift \nexpenditures to priority areas. Tuvalu\u2019s overall fiscal performance will therefore improve. Budget \nrestraint and strengthened fiscal management will allow the government to use the CIF more \neffectively as a fiscal stabilizer and reduce Tuvalu\u2019s vulnerability to fiscal shocks. The program\u2019s \nlong-term impact will be greater government capacity for sound fiscal management, which will \nhelp  bring  the  budget  deficit  to  sustainable  levels  while  still  enabling  increased  capital \nexpenditure. \n \nB.  Governance \n32.  The  government\u2019s  ability  to  implement  its  budget  is  integral  to  the  success  of  the \nprogram. Internal controls and external oversight gaps identified by a public expenditure and \nfinancial accountability assessment in 2011 have been strengthened through, although not \nlimited to, better financial record keeping, conduct of annual independent audits, and centralized \ntreasury commitment and expenditure controls. The appointment of a government ombudsman \nin  2014  will  also  help  eliminate  or  greatly  reduce  corrupt  practices  in  government.21 The \nemphasis  of  the  PRM  on  improving  public  financial  management,  including  measures  to \nimprove revenue administration, accounting procedures, reporting, procurement policy, audit, \nbudget formulation, and planning, demonstrates the government\u2019s commitment to managing the \nbudget credibly and effectively. \n \n33.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government. Consistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability, and \ntransparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged \ncorrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the program. The program will \nadhere to ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Implementing the Second Governance and Anticorruption Action \nPlan (2014).22 \n \nC.  Poverty and Social \n34.  Improved public sector management will have positive impacts on the delivery of social \nservices. Layoffs will be avoided during public enterprise rationalization, and where they may \noccur, it is expected that employees will either transition into the private sector or be retained in \nthe public sector. Any adverse labor market implications on future privatization efforts will be \nundertaken in dialogue with the government and development partners and supported with \npipeline TA.23 \n \n                                                \n21 The assessment was supported under ADB. 2011.

Program activities will be confined to policy and institutional reforms, and none of the \nactivities will result in, or lead to, involuntary resettlement, nor will they affect indigenous people. \nSafeguard categories for environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples are all \nC. Regular and close dialogue with the government and development partners was carried out \nduring country visits and throughout implementation of the program. \n \nE.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n36.  The program faces three key risks:  \n(i)  The narrow economic base leaves the country vulnerable to shocks. Should \nthese  occur,  the  reform  focus  would  likely  switch  from  strengthening  public \nfinancial management to short-term stabilization. \n(ii)  The political consensus needed to mount program reforms could prove difficult to \nmaintain, particularly for public enterprise reforms. \n(iii)  Capacity constraints and staff turnover could limit the government\u2019s ability to \nmanage the program. \n \n37.  The program design mitigates these risks. The rebuilt fiscal reserves are helping the \ngovernment weather potential external shocks. Political consensus has been reinforced through \nthe government\u2019s ownership and leadership of the PRM process and the subsequent reform \neffort.  In  addition,  the  MFED,  with  support  from  ADB  TA  (footnote  13),  has  conducted  a \nconcerted outreach program to build wider support for reform among parliamentarians and \nacross  government  ministries.  Capacity  constraints  will  be  offset  in  part  through  new  and \nongoing TA provided by ADB and other partners. Overall risk is assessed to be medium. Major \nrisks  and  mitigating  measures  are  described  in  detail  in  the  risk  assessment  and  risk \nmanagement plan.24 Integrated benefits and impacts are expected to outweigh the costs. \n \nIV.  ASSURANCES \n38.  The government has assured ADB that implementation of the program shall conform to \nall applicable ADB policies including those concerning anticorruption measures, safeguards, \ngender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail in the grant \nagreement. The government has agreed with ADB on certain covenants for the program, which \nare set forth in the grant agreement. The grant will become effective after ADB is satisfied that \nall conditions for the release of the program tranche, as specified in the policy matrix and set out \nin Attachment 2 to Schedule 2 of the grant agreement, have been complied with. \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n39.  I am satisfied that the proposed policy-based grant would comply with the Articles of \nAgreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve the \ngrant of $2,000,000 to Tuvalu for the Strengthened Fiscal Sustainability Program, from ADB\u2019s \nSpecial  Funds  resources;  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  as  are  substantially  in \naccordance with those set forth in the grant agreement presented to the Board. \n \n \n                  Takehiko Nakao \n                  President \n7 September 2015\n                                                \n24 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "Appendix 1  11 \n \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nImpacts the Program is aligned with: \n \nGood governance, macroeconomic growth, and fiscal stability improved (National Strategy for Sustainable \nDevelopment, 2005\u20132015a) \n \n \nProgram  Performance Indicators with  Data Sources and \nRisks \nResults Chain  Targets and Baselines  Reporting  \nOutcome  The CIF minimum target balance  Government of  Broad reform consensus \nFiscal position  is at least 16% of the TTF\u2019s real  Tuvalu\u2019s annual  weakens due to political \nstrengthened  maintained  value  during  2016\u2013 budget documents  pressure \n2020  TTF Account   \n(2009\u20132013 baseline: Average  Committee bi-annual \nExternal shocks requiring \nbalance of 6.8%)  reports  CIF drawdown \n \nOutputs      Stakeholders with vested \n1.
