THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \ncontingent disaster financing (CDF) facility to the Cook Islands; (ii) a proposed policy-based loan \nto the Republic of Palau; and (iii) proposed policy-based grants to the Federated States of \nMicronesia (FSM), the Republic of Kiribati, the Republic of the Marshall Islands (RMI), the \nIndependent State of Samoa, Solomon Islands, the Kingdom of Tonga, Tuvalu, and the Republic \nof Vanuatu for the Pacific Disaster Resilience Program (Phase 3). \n \n2.  The  proposed  CDF  program  will  improve  the  resilience  of  the  participating  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) Pacific developing member countries (DMCs) to disasters triggered by \nnatural hazards and health emergencies. It will support policy actions strengthening resilience to \ndisasters and provide a source of financing for timely emergency response and early recovery. \nThe program is the third phase of the Pacific Disaster Resilience Program; the first phase was \napproved in December 2017 for Samoa, Tonga, and Tuvalu,1 and the second phase in September \n2019 for FSM, RMI, Solomon Islands, and Tonga.2 In addition, ADB set up country-specific CDF \nprograms for the Cook Islands and Palau.3 Phase 3 will provide (i) another round of financing for \n(a) countries that drew down their CDF programs for the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) \npandemic (the Cook Islands, FSM, RMI, Palau, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga) and (b) Tuvalu, \nwhich drew down the funds in February 2020 in response to Cyclone Tino; and (ii) CDF for the \nfirst time for Kiribati and Vanuatu.  \n \nII.  PROGRAM AND RATIONALE \n \nA.  Background and Development Constraints \n \n3.  Disasters and health emergencies in the Pacific. ADB\u2019s Pacific DMCs are highly \nexposed to many types of hazards, including tropical cyclones, earthquakes, storm surges, \ntsunamis, volcanic eruptions, floods, droughts, and disease outbreaks. The region experiences a \ndisproportionately high share of global disaster impacts relative to the size of its economy and \npopulation. Disaster risk is increasing because of climate change, poor development planning, \nunplanned urbanization, and ecosystem decline. Climate change can increase the intensity of \nextreme weather events. Sea level rise is increasing erosion and the risk of more destructive \nstorm surges and tsunamis, and ocean warming and acidification are destroying the coral reefs \nthat form natural coastal barriers. Climate change may also create favorable conditions for the \ndistribution of vector-borne and zoonotic diseases.  \n \n4.  Pacific DMCs have limited resources and capacity to invest in resilience to natural hazards \nand health risks, and to facilitate timely recovery and reconstruction; they also face further \nchallenges because of their remote locations and geographical features. Most have relatively \nsmall populations that are widely dispersed over multiple islands, many of which are isolated and \ndifficult to reach during emergencies. These factors contribute to the relatively high cost and \ndelayed delivery of emergency response and reconstruction. The delays exacerbate the indirect \neconomic and social costs of disasters, worsen their ultimate impacts, and compromise long-term \nfiscal balances. Disasters can erode many years of economic development gains by damaging \ncritical infrastructure, disrupting services, and diverting resources from development spending. 4 \n \n1  ADB.

Policy  and  institutional  arrangements  for  risk  management.  Disaster  risk \nmanagement (DRM) objectives are generally well articulated within the participating DMCs\u2019 \npolicies  and  plans,  and  all  countries  have  defined  the  legal  responsibilities  for  DRM  and \nprocedures for declaring a state of emergency or disaster. However, building resilience requires \nactions on many fronts, and the countries remain constrained by limited capacity and competing \npriorities. Women and girls are disproportionately impacted by disasters and face greater barriers \nto participating in, and benefitting from, DRM arrangements. The governments recognize that \nmore effort is required to strengthen policy and institutional arrangements, and to strengthen \ncapacity to reduce risks and to plan and implement timely and effective responses and early \nrecovery at national and local levels. DRM arrangements can be further strengthened by defining \nroles and responsibilities in policies and legislation, and by incorporating climate change and DRM \ninto national and sector planning. Sex-disaggregated data and gender analysis can help highlight \nthe need to specifically support women and girls through policy actions. The 10 DMCs have, \nthrough early and decisive action, prevented the spread of COVID-19 within their territories, and \nprepared  their  health  systems  to  manage  imported  cases  as  repatriation  of  nationals  and \nreopening of borders are being introduced.5 In order to contain a possible outbreak, whole-of-\ngovernment public health policies and legislation are required to ensure early detection, timely \nactivation of emergency response protocols for case management, and cross-sector coordination.  \n \n6.  Risk-informed  investment  planning  processes  and  tools.  Capacity  to  deal  with \ndisasters and public health emergencies is particularly weak at the local level. Regular capacity \nbuilding and drills are required to ensure successful implementation of emergency response \nplans. National disaster management offices are often underfunded, and health systems are weak \nthroughout the Pacific. Physical development and land use planning often give insufficient regard \nto considerations of resilience. Climate and disaster resilience of communities and assets can be \nstrengthened by enhancing related strategies and plans; strengthening gender mainstreaming; \nintegrating resilience considerations into sector, land use and settlement plans; and ensuring risk \nsensitive asset management, including for state-owned utilities. Capacity for infectious disease \nprevention, detection, and clinical management can be significantly strengthened in all countries, \nincluding upgrading of local laboratories for COVID-19 testing, expanding quarantine capacity, \nand maintaining adequate supply of essential medical supplies and equipment. Solomon Islands \nand Vanuatu must also contend with the aftermath of Cyclone Harold that struck in April 2020, \nand the duality of the crises requires balancing pandemic prevention and cyclone response \nneeds. Other DMCs have also experienced the dual impact of COVID-19 and extreme weather \nevents, such as droughts in FSM, RMI, and Palau. \n \n7.  Risk financing. All 10 DMCs have some financial arrangements in place for emergency \nresponse,  including  annual  contingency  budgets  and,  in  some  cases,  sovereign  disaster \ninsurance. Improved access to and management of disaster finance is critical for achieving \nstrategic  outcomes  related  to  long-term  resilience.  In  the  event  of  a  significant  disaster, \ngovernments typically have insufficient resources through budget contingency lines, reserves, or \ninsurance to meet immediate financing needs. Instead, they rely heavily on budget reallocations, \nwhich can take time to secure and often redirect funds away from development priorities. \nReallocations for emergency response within the health sector budget are particularly concerning \nwhere these deplete resources for critical health priorities. Supporting better use of emergency \nfinance requires strengthening public financial management and expenditure, and ensuring funds \nfor emergency response are earmarked, and that budgeting covers gender and social inclusion. \n \n \n \n5  As of 29 October 2020, imported COVID-19 cases or repatriated nationals have been reported in Solomon Islands \n(8) and RMI (2). All cases remain in isolation. The other eight countries remain COVID-19 free. \n ", "3 \n8.  Development  partner  support.  In  the  aftermath  of  disasters  in  the  Pacific,  major \ndevelopment partners\u2014including the governments of Australia, the People\u2019s Republic of China, \nJapan, New Zealand, and the United States\u2014usually move quickly to mobilize immediate relief, \nincluding in-kind support and financing through humanitarian nongovernment organizations. \nThe United Nations\u2019 Pacific Humanitarian Team mobilizes relief and technical support from \nseveral regional offices. Development partners, including ADB, also provide financing to support \nreconstruction. There is regular coordination between the governments and major development \npartners, including ADB, the World Bank, Australia, and New Zealand, on macroeconomic and \nstructural  reforms  and  joint  policy  matrices.  The  policy  dialogue  on  the  CDF  programs  is \ncoordinated with World Bank programs with Catastrophe Deferred Drawdown Options.6 \n   \n9.  ADB engagement and lessons. ADB attaches significant importance to DRM in the \nPacific, and has provided loans, grants, and technical assistance (TA) for post-disaster response, \nearly recovery, and reconstruction. This support has progressively broadened from post-disaster \nassistance to proactive disaster risk reduction (DRR) through various financing mechanisms. ADB \nprovides dedicated funding to its concessional assistance-only countries through the Asian \nDevelopment Fund (ADF) 12 DRR financing mechanism; and concessional assistance countries \ncan access the ADF 13 (2021\u20132024) Regional Thematic Pool for DRR purposes. ADB often plays \na  key  role  in  post-disaster  needs  assessments  that  seek  to  inform  resilient  recovery  and \nreconstruction. For post-disaster humanitarian response, ADB\u2019s Asia Pacific Disaster Response \nFund can provide grants up to $3 million per event within 1 week of a disaster.7 Additional \nconcessional funds can be accessed through the ADF Disaster Response Facility for early \nrecovery and reconstruction. Since 2004, ADB has offered an emergency assistance loans \ninstrument with extended grace and repayment periods, increased retroactive financing, lower \ninterest rates, and streamlined processing requirements, thereby facilitating the approval of fast-\ntracked assistance for early recovery purposes.8 Nevertheless, emergency assistance loans can \nstill take 3 months or more to process, and reconstruction loans under normal lending modalities \ncan  take  significantly  longer.  Therefore,  since 2016,  ADB  has  set  up  contingent  financing \nprograms in eight Pacific DMCs to provide more timely post-disaster financing through stand-\nalone policy-based loans and grants. In August 2019, ADB formally adopted CDF as an option \nunder its policy-based lending policy,9 and in April 2020, ADB approved a special policy variation \nfor an initial duration of 15 months that expands the scope of new CDF to include health-related \nemergencies as part of ADB\u2019s response to COVID-19.10 \n \n10.  ADB has supported efforts to strengthen the Pacific region\u2019s resilience to infectious \ndiseases through the regional vaccines project in Samoa, Tonga, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu.11 In \naddition to the countries drawing down on existing CDF programs, ADB\u2019s immediate and medium-\nterm response to COVID-19 in the participating countries includes the COVID-19 Pandemic \nResponse Option assistance approved for the Cook Islands ($20 million), FSM ($14 million), \nPalau ($20 million), Samoa ($20 million), and Solomon Islands ($20 million).12 A policy-based \ngrant that included policy actions on COVID-19 response was also approved for Tonga ($12.2 \nmillion).13 These programs help address the economic and direct health impacts of COVID-19 by \n \n6  A contingent financing line to address shocks related to disasters caused by natural hazards or health-related events.  \n7  ADB.

All 10 \nparticipating countries have also accessed the Asia Pacific Disaster Response Fund to address \nimmediate financing gaps under their national COVID-19 response plans.14 Through regional TA, \nADB has also provided support for regional pooled procurement of essential and emergency \nsupplies for COVID-19.15 In addition, ADB has other regional TA for medium- to long-term support \nin response to COVID-19 in Pacific DMCs.16  \n \n11.  The proposed approach. The program provides Pacific DMCs with a source of financing \nthat  can  be  rapidly  disbursed  following  disaster  events.  It  will  complement  risk  financing \ninstruments currently in use by the participating governments, including annual contingency \nbudgets,  national  disaster  funds,  parametric  disaster  insurance,  and  traditional  indemnity \ninsurance. Eligibility to withdraw loan and grant proceeds is based on achieving prior resilience-\nrelated policy actions, but disbursements will be triggered when a state of disaster or emergency \nis declared. The DRM policy actions for each participating DMC will reduce the underlying disaster \nrisk and enhance preparedness. Each government has also agreed on an ongoing post-program \npartnership framework (PPPF) to strengthen DRM performance that is based on a gap and needs \nanalysis in each country. In addition to disasters caused by natural hazards, the scope of phase \n3 is expanded to cover health-related emergencies in the policy matrices. The DMCs face similar \nchallenges and will benefit greatly from a regional approach in which good practices are shared. \nThe program will support coordination and cooperation both between Pacific DMCs and with \ndevelopment partners on risk financing arrangements and policy reform discussions. The first \nphase of the regional program includes an attached TA, and this has been expanded to include \nthe new countries under phase 3.17 The TA project has started country-level support to strengthen \nthe policy environment and institutional arrangements for DRM by strengthening post-disaster \nfinancial management capacity, started work on disaster risk information in some countries, and \ninitiated multi-hazard disaster risk assessments. Gender considerations are mainstreamed in the \ncountry-level support under the TA. \n \n12.  The program is in line with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030, in particular its operational priority 3 on \ntackling climate change, building climate and disaster resilience, and enhancing environmental \nsustainability, which supports strengthening DMCs\u2019 financial preparedness for disaster response \nthrough policy-based contingent financing.18 The program aligns with ADB\u2019s operational plan for \nhealth by strengthening institutions for improved health governance, and enabling health financing \nto tackle public health threats and pandemic preparedness;19 and with the Pacific Approach, \nwhich serves as ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for the 11 smaller Pacific DMCs, including \nthe 10 countries in this program.20 The Pacific Approach focuses on managing risks as a key \nstrategic  area,  and  highlights  the  need  to  (i)  expand  work  on  climate  change  and  DRM;  \n(ii) introduce innovative solutions to strengthen disaster preparedness, address vulnerability, and \nbuild resilience; (iii) pursue a more programmatic and regional approach to financing climate \n \n14 Approved amounts range between $0.5 million and $1.5 million per country.   \n15 ADB.

Policy Reform and ADB\u2019s Value Addition \n \n13.   This phase 3 program will provide another round of financing for countries that drew down \ntheir CDF programs in 2020 (para. 2), restoring their financial resilience to pre\u2013COVID-19 levels \nahead of the next cyclone season. In addition to supporting critical DRM actions, the program \nsupports urgent measures required by DMCs to prepare for and address the economic impact of \nCOVID-19. All 10 countries have made significant progress in strengthening the resilience of \ninstitutions and communities through three reform areas under phase 3, with policy actions \ncompleted by October 2020 as outlined below and in the country-specific policy matrices.22 \n \n14.   Reform  area  1:  Policy  and  institutional  arrangements  for  risk  management \nstrengthened. Resilience considerations were mainstreamed into the new national strategic plan \nin RMI. Long-term preparedness and response plans to COVID-19 and other health emergencies, \nand COVID-19 specific regulations, were developed by all national governments. The Cook \nIslands  and  Samoa  also  prepared  health  emergency  bills,  and  Vanuatu  prepared  a  role \ndelineation policy to standardize health systems. In Kiribati, Samoa, Tonga, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu, \nthe governments prepared climate change and DRM-related bills. Kiribati also prepared a national \naction  plan  on  climate  change,  incorporating  DRM,  and  considering  gender-differentiated \nvulnerabilities  and  impacts.  A  national  land  subdivision  policy,  incorporating  resilience \nconsiderations into land and settlement development, was approved for Vanuatu; a national urban \npolicy with resilience considerations was approved for Solomon Islands; and a national housing \nrecovery and resilience policy was approved for Tonga. The Solomon Islands Maritime Authority \nBoard was established, marking a significant step in strengthening the maritime authority\u2019s role in \nemergencies and disaster events; and RMI established new disaster management operational \narrangements.  The  PPPFs  include  further  actions  in  these  areas  such  as  emergency \nmanagement acts; integrated policies and plans on climate change, DRM, and spatial planning; \nrisk-informed land-use and urban policies, as well as hazard and disaster data-sharing policies; \nand public health legislation and policies.  \n \n15.   Reform area 2: Risk-informed investment planning processes and tools improved. \nAsset management was strengthened in the Cook Islands, Palau, Samoa and Tuvalu through \nasset management plans and strategies, and improved asset registries and property registration \nand  building  licensing.  In  Palau,  risk  information  has  been  incorporated  into  the  urban \ndevelopment strategy and plan, and in Tuvalu, the Funafuti drought monitoring plan was approved \nto improve drought preparedness. Tonga\u2019s new water resources bill incorporated climate and \ndisaster resilience considerations. National and/or local-level DRM plans were prepared in the \nCook Islands, FSM, Samoa, Tonga, and Tuvalu; and integrated vulnerability assessments were \napproved in Tuvalu using a whole-of-island approach to inform the decision-making process. \nIn RMI  and  Tonga,  sector  or  cluster  specific  standard  operating  procedures  and  terms  of \nreference were developed. Kiribati finalized a strategic roadmap for emergency management. \nCross-sectoral table-top exercises were carried out in FSM and RMI to strengthen emergency \npreparedness. Health sector-specific emergency plans and regulations were prepared in all \n10 countries to define key preparedness and response activities, including expanding quarantine \nunits, upgrading isolation wards, stockpiling personal protective equipment and medication, and \nequipping local laboratories for COVID-19 testing. In FSM, all four state governments also \n \n21 Pacific Community. 2016. Framework for Resilient Development in the Pacific, 2017\u20132030.

In Palau, climate change and DRM \nwere incorporated into the high school science curriculum. The country-specific PPPFs include \nfurther actions on incorporating resilience considerations into building codes; updating national \ninfrastructure investment plans; preparing local disaster plans, multi-hazard risk assessments, \nand  climate-  and  disaster  risk-sensitive  zoning  regulations;  and  strengthening  capacity  for \ninfectious disease prevention. \n \n16.   Reform area 3: Risk financing expanded. Specific COVID-19 economic response \nfinancing packages were approved in all 10 countries including a long-term phased approach. \nResources  available  nationally  for  emergency  response  were  expanded  through  increased \nbudget allocations to national emergency funds, budgets and/or disaster insurance in the Cook \nIslands, FSM, Kiribati, RMI, Palau, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga, and Vanuatu; and Kiribati \nalso prepared a climate change and disaster risk financing assessment with an action plan. \nThe PPPFs include further actions, such as development of multi-hazard contingency plans and \ndisaster risk financing strategies; and strengthening of post-disaster budget allocation, execution \nand reporting processes, and procurement arrangements. \n \n17.  Value addition. Contingent financing can be effective in addressing risks associated with \nevents that would exhaust dedicated national reserves or contingency budgets but occur too \nfrequently to be covered cost-effectively through insurance. The program will address this critical \nfinancing gap. Moreover, ADB and the participating governments have engaged in an ongoing \npolicy dialogue since the processing of the previous CDF programs in the Pacific to support the \nimplementation of the policy actions identified in the previous PPPFs. The DRM gaps identified \nfollowing the approval of the earlier CDF programs are addressed by new PPPFs developed for \nphase 3, including near- and medium-term government plans to strengthen resilience. The \nattached TA (footnote 17) supports priority PPPF actions, and facilitates regional knowledge \nsharing on DRM and integration of regional objectives into national strategies. \n \nC.  Impacts of the Reform \n \n18.   The impact of the program is aligned with goals 1 (strengthened integrated adaptation and \nrisk reduction to enhance resilience to climate change and disasters) and 3 (strengthened disaster \npreparedness, response and recovery) of the Framework for Resilient Development in the Pacific \n(footnote 21). The program is also aligned to objective 1 of the regional COVID-19 health sector \nsupport plan to expand country readiness and response operations.23 The program will provide a \ntimely and predictable source of emergency financing to facilitate rapid implementation of priority \nactions, and reduce the indirect economic and social costs of direct physical losses.  \n \n19.   The policy actions will encourage reforms that ultimately result in economic benefits by \naddressing the constraints that have been identified in DRM. The economic impact of the policy \nactions will depend on the scale and type of disaster event, and geographic area of impact. Under \nreform area 1, potential benefits will include reduced loss of lives and property, and reduced costs \ndue to shorter business and public facility closures. These benefits will result from improved \nplanning and response and faster restoration of essential infrastructure and services. Under \nreform area 2, benefits will include reduced damage to property, improved public safety, and \nreduced health impacts. These will result from improved sector planning, improved response and \npreparedness to disasters and health-related emergencies, and more resilient infrastructure and \nassets. Under reform area 3, the opportunity costs associated with budget reallocations and \nfinancial costs associated with additional borrowing will be reduced, while the economic stimulus \npackages will reduce the income loss of vulnerable households and businesses.   \n \n23 World Health Organization. 2020. COVID-19 Pacific Health Sector Support Plan Phase II. Suva. \n ", "7 \nD.  Development Financing Needs and Budget Support \n \n20.   During the initial availability period of 2021\u20132023, the overall development financing needs \nof participating governments are estimated to be 10.2%\u201325.4% of gross domestic product (GDP) \nper annum, with 12.5% to 16.2% of GDP to be mobilized from external financing, predominantly \nas grants.24 The post-disaster financing needs have been determined based on the likely fiscal \nimpact of medium- to low-frequency disasters, taking into account resources available from \ndomestic and international sources, the need to maintain sustainable levels of debt, and the \navailability of concessional resources. Although data on historical losses are incomplete, analysis \nundertaken under the Pacific Catastrophe Risk Assessment and Financing Initiative indicates that \naverage annual losses from cyclones, earthquakes, and tsunamis alone are equivalent to 2.0% \nof GDP in the Cook Islands, 2.9% in FSM, 0.2% in Kiribati, 2.0% in RMI, 1.6% in Palau, 1.7% in \nSamoa, 3.0% in Solomon Islands, 4.3% in Tonga, 0.8% in Tuvalu, and 6.6% in Vanuatu. Probable \nmaximum losses for a 1-in-50-year event (limited to cyclones, earthquakes, and tsunamis) are \nestimated at $56.8 million for the Cook Islands, $75.3 million for FSM, $0.4 million for Kiribati, \n$34.1 million for RMI, $16.8 million for Palau, $109.8 million for Samoa, $189.6 million for \nSolomon  Islands,  $140.2  million  for  Tonga,  $2.8 million  for  Tuvalu,  and  $61.4  million  for \nVanuatu.25 In addition to cyclones, earthquakes and tsunamis, frequent flooding and drought \nevents are causing recurrent losses in the participating countries, with a cumulative impact on \nlivelihoods and economies. The 10 countries also experience storm surges, health emergencies \nand, in some cases, volcanic eruptions.  \n \n21.  Recent examples of disasters in the participating countries include Cyclone Harold in April \n2020, which caused damage and loss estimated at $453 million (46% of GDP) in Vanuatu; and \n$111 million (25% of GDP) in Tonga. Other examples include Cyclone Gita in 2018, which caused \ndamage equivalent to 38% of GDP in Tonga; Cyclone Pam in 2015 with estimated damage and \nloss at around $600 million, or 64% of GDP in Vanuatu; severe flooding in 2014, causing damage \nequivalent to 9% of GDP in Solomon Islands; Typhoon Maysak, which caused losses equivalent \nto 4% of GDP in FSM; and severe drought in 2016, which caused losses of 3% of GDP in RMI. \nThe proposed financing per country under the program ranges from 0.5% to 9.4% of annual GDP, \nless than the cost of a typical medium-impact disaster in the Pacific.  \n \n22.   The economic impacts of COVID-19 are projected to be significant: travel restrictions are \nexpected to cause significant declines in those Pacific economies dependent on either tourism or \nlabor exports. Economic contraction in the Pacific is now forecast at 6.1% in 2020 because of the \nCOVID-19 pandemic. For example, in the Cook Islands, the economy is expected to contract by \n7.0% in FY2020 and by a further 15.4% in FY2021; and in Palau by 9.5% in FY2020 and by a \nfurther 12.8% in FY2021, mostly due to the total shutdown of the tourism sector due to the COVID-\n19 pandemic.26 Pacific countries continue to impose travel restrictions to safeguard their limited \nhealthcare  systems  from  possible  COVID-19  outbreaks.  To  help  finance  the  program,  the \ngovernments have requested (i) a facility of NZ$30,312,000 for the Cook Islands from ADB\u2019s \nordinary capital resources (OCR).27 In accordance with the CDF pricing option 2, after the \noccurrence of a qualifying disaster, ADB and the Cook Islands will enter into a short-form \nagreement that will specify the actual loan amount requested by the Cook Islands, as well as the \nlending terms, and only then will ADB commit the requested amount. Upon signing the short-form \nagreement there will be a one-time front-end fee of 0.10% of the committed loan amount. If the \ncommitted funds are not fully disbursed, the undisbursed loan amount could be renewed for a 3-\nyear availability period (up to four times), each time with a fee of 0.25% of the renewal amount \n \n24 Fiscal deficit and external financing figures are gross national income-weighted averages for the 10 countries. \n25 Pacific Catastrophe Risk Assessment and Financing Initiative. 2011.

Implementation Arrangements \n \n23.   Executing  agencies  will  be  the  Ministry  of  Finance  or  equivalent  in  each  country. \nImplementing  agencies  will  include  ministries  responsible  for  health,  finance,  planning, \ninfrastructure, DRM, and climate change. Each participating DMC has country-specific policy \nactions and legal agreements. In the case of the eight countries that had earlier CDF programs \n(para. 2), the new policy actions were completed after the completion of the previous phase policy \nactions, but before 31 October 2020. In the case of newly joining countries, policy actions were \ncompleted between 1 December 2018 and 31 October 2020.28 The program will be completed on \n30 June 2024, with a renewal option for (i) a second 3-year period for the ADF countries; and (ii) \nup to four additional 3-year periods for the OCR countries. Program renewal is subject to \nreconfirmation  as  to  adequacy  of  the  macroeconomic  environment,  including  an  updated \nInternational Monetary Fund assessment letter; DMCs\u2019 continued progress toward the PPPF; and \nan updated PPPF with mutually agreed objectives for the subsequent availability period. Renewal \nmay also be affected by any changes to the country classification during the program period.29  \n \n24.   Disbursements. A withdrawal may be triggered after a government declares a state of \ndisaster or emergency in accordance with applicable national laws and regulations, or takes \nequivalent  measures,  following  a  disaster  caused  by  a  natural  hazard  or  a  health-related \nemergency during the availability period; or, in the case of COVID-19, only after the government \n \n28 Policy actions were identified, and their implementation encouraged through policy dialogue, which has been ongoing \nsince 2017 with some support from various ongoing TA projects. \n29 Footnote 9, para. 26. \n ", "9 \nreports occurrence of community transmission as confirmed by the World Health Organization,30 \nas specified in each legal agreement. The government can withdraw the loan and grant proceeds \npartially or entirely, depending on its assessment of the event\u2019s severity and resultant need. Only \na single withdrawal may be requested per event, and the request should be received by ADB \nwithin 90 days of the respective declaration of a state of disaster or emergency or equivalent \nmeasure.31 Any undisbursed amounts at the conclusion of the availability period can be disbursed \nto the respective participating countries under the deferred disbursement option, subject to ADB \nreconfirming the DMC\u2019s continued adoption of policy actions and the PPPF through submission \nof a progress report. Funds will be spent through national budget processes for eligible items.32 \nProceeds of the policy-based loans and grants will be withdrawn in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan \nDisbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from time to time). ADB will periodically monitor \ncontinuing implementation of the policy actions and PPPF during the availability period. \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \n25.   In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the program is classified \nas category C for environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples safeguards.33 \nProgram activities are confined to policy and institutional reforms, and none of the activities will \nresult in or lead to any physical works that could create environmental or social impacts, physical \nor economic displacement, or involuntary resettlement. The activities will not negatively affect \nindigenous peoples. Stakeholder dialogue was carried out during the program design and will \ncontinue during implementation. The policy actions will improve the participating countries\u2019 ability \nto maintain greater fiscal stability in the event of a disaster or health emergency and to initiate \nrelief and recovery efforts with minimum delay, thereby reducing the immediate economic and \nsocial impacts of the event. Implementation of the policy actions is expected to continue to \nstrengthen existing social protection arrangements, helping to ensure that communities and \nvulnerable households (including households headed by women) can receive support to rebuild \ntheir lives and assets. The policy actions on COVID-19 response will benefit vulnerable groups \nsuch as older people and those with pre-existing co-morbidities, as they will be disproportionately \naffected by the potential direct impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. \n \n26.   The program is classified effective gender mainstreaming. Women are impacted by \ndisasters and health emergencies in different and often overlooked ways. The program will \ndirectly benefit women by ensuring gender is a core component of key strategic and policy \ndocuments.  Gender-responsive  policy  and  institutional  arrangements  for  risk  management \ninclude gender-specific performance indicators to monitor the empowerment and protection of \nwomen and girls in climate change and DRM plans (Kiribati); a national housing recovery and \nresilience policy that prioritizes households headed by women (Tonga); and climate change or \nDRM acts that commit to gender mainstreaming, ensuring women\u2019s participation in decision-\nmaking, and providing support for gender-based violence prevention and response in post-\ndisaster situations (RMI, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu). Investment planning processes and tools that \nsupport women and girls include community integrated management plans for climate and \ndisaster resilience that promote the participation of women in DRM decision-making (Samoa and \nTonga); Cyclone Tino Recovery and Vulnerability Reduction Plan allocating funding for gender \n \n30 Community transmission is the highest level of the 4-level COVID-19 transmission classification adopted by the \nWorld Health Organization. It involves large outbreaks of local transmission defined through an assessment of factors \nincluding, but not limited to: (i) large numbers of cases not linkable to transmission chains; (ii) large numbers of cases \nfrom sentinel lab surveillance; and (iii) multiple unrelated clusters in several areas of the country. \n31 The start date of a disaster event is often not clear (e.g., droughts, floods); however, a declaration is typically issued \nvery shortly after a natural hazard event turns into a disaster, and is therefore used as a proxy for the disaster event.  \n32 List of Ineligible Items (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n33 ADB. Safeguard Categories. \n ", "10 \nand  protection  initiatives  (including  gender-based  violence),  and  integrated  vulnerability \nassessments that include gender analysis and data (Tuvalu); municipal preparedness plans that \nuse standardized damage assessment forms, including questions on women\u2019s needs and gender-\nbased violence (FSM); and an Urban Development Plan that highlights linkages to Sustainable \nDevelopment  Goal  5  on  women\u2019s  empowerment,  and  commits  to  the  collection  of  sex-\ndisaggregated data and gender analysis (Palau). The final reform area on expanded risk financing \nincludes funding commitments for gender and protection clusters (Solomon Islands), provision of \ndignity kits for women and girls (RMI), and support for caregivers (the Cook Islands). \n \n27.   Coordinating disaster and health emergency response, including the support offered by \ndonors and civil society organizations with competing requirements and procedures, can pose \nsignificant administrative challenges. Therefore, government absorption capacities are often \nstretched in the aftermath of such events. The regional TA under phase 1 has been expanded to \ninclude all countries under phase 3, and it prioritizes capacity development focused on financing \nand budgetary issues, including post-disaster budget allocation and execution, to ensure that all \nparticipating countries have adequate systems in place to use program resources effectively, \naccountably, and transparently (footnote 17). Risks to program implementation are related to \npossible external shocks to the economies and capacity constraints among government agencies, \nincluding public financial management system constraints. These risks will be managed in part \nthrough support for capacity development of government counterparts. Major risks and mitigating \nmeasures are described in detail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.34 \n \n28.   ADB\u2019s debt sustainability analyses for the Cook Islands and Palau\u2014the only countries \nunder phase 3 accessing loan resources\u2014indicate that near-term vulnerabilities have increased \nas a result of the fiscal impacts of COVID-19. 35 However, with public debt-to-GDP ratios projected \nto decline over the medium-term as economies recover from the current crisis, ADB\u2019s debt \nsustainability  analyses  conclude  that  debt  remains  sustainable  in  these  countries. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed with the \ngovernments and executing agencies.  \n \nIV.  ASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n \n29.   The governments have assured ADB that implementation of the program shall conform to \nall applicable ADB policies, including those concerning anticorruption measures, safeguards, \ngender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail in the legal \nagreements. No disbursement shall be made unless ADB is satisfied that a qualifying disaster \nevent has occurred or that the conditions for deferred disbursement option have been met. \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n30.   I am satisfied that the proposed contingent disaster financing facility, policy-based loan, \nand policy-based grants would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Asian Development \nBank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve: \n \n34 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n35 Debt sustainability analyses are conducted in connection with recent or planned CPRO operations. For the Cook \nIslands, the debt-to-GDP ratio is projected peak at about 43% in FY2022 before declining gradually to 38% by \nFY2024. For Palau, public debt is seen to reach 69% of GDP in FY2021 but can revert to the pre-COVID-19 level of \n32% of GDP by FY2028. Sound macroeconomic management is an eligibility criterion for CPRO operations, which \nhave been approved for the Cook Islands, FSM, Palau, Samoa, and Solomon Islands, and are forthcoming for RMI \nand Vanuatu. The IMF Assessment Letters for 9 countries (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix \n2), and ADB\u2019s macroeconomic assessment for the Cook Islands, confirm that the countries broadly demonstrated \nstrong macroeconomic management prior to COVID-19, allowing them to build fiscal buffers, but the pandemic is \nresulting in temporary near-term fiscal imbalances.   \n ", "11 \n(i)  the contingent disaster financing facility to the Cook Islands for the Pacific Disaster \nResilience Program (Phase 3) in an aggregate principal amount not exceeding \nNZ$30,312,000, which comprises the provision of loans from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources, in regular terms, with interest and other terms to be determined in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending \nfacility; and is subject to such other terms and conditions as are substantially in \naccordance with those set forth in the draft facility agreement presented to the Board; \n(ii)  the loan of $20,000,000 to the Republic of Palau for the Pacific Disaster Resilience \nProgram (Phase 3) from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, in regular terms, with \ninterest to be determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate \n(LIBOR)-based lending facility; for a term of 15 years, including a grace period of 3 \nyears; and such other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with \nthose set forth in the draft loan agreement presented to the Board;  \n(iii)  the grant not exceeding $6,000,000 to the Federated States of Micronesia from \nADB\u2019s Special Funds resources (Asian Development Fund) for the Pacific Disaster \nResilience Program (Phase 3) on terms and conditions that are substantially in \naccordance with those set forth in the draft grant agreement presented to the Board;  \n(iv)  the grant not exceeding $8,000,000 to the Republic of Kiribati from ADB\u2019s Special \nFunds resources (Asian Development Fund) for the Pacific Disaster Resilience \nProgram (Phase 3) on terms and conditions that are substantially in accordance with \nthose set forth in the draft grant agreement presented to the Board;  \n(v)  the grant not exceeding $6,000,000 to the Republic of the Marshall Islands from \nADB\u2019s Special Funds resources (Asian Development Fund) for the Pacific Disaster \nResilience Program (Phase 3) on terms and conditions that are substantially in \naccordance with those set forth in the draft grant agreement presented to the Board; \n(vi)  the grant not exceeding $10,000,000 to Independent State of Samoa from ADB\u2019s \nSpecial  Funds  resources  (Asian  Development  Fund)  for  the  Pacific  Disaster \nResilience Program (Phase 3) on terms and conditions that are substantially in \naccordance with those set forth in the draft grant agreement presented to the Board;  \n(vii)  the grant not exceeding $5,000,000 to the Solomon Islands from ADB\u2019s Special \nFunds resources (Asian Development Fund) for the Pacific Disaster Resilience \nProgram (Phase 3) on terms and conditions that are substantially in accordance with \nthose set forth in the draft grant agreement presented to the Board; \n(viii)  the grant not exceeding $10,000,000 to the Kingdom of Tonga from ADB\u2019s Special \nFunds resources (Asian Development Fund) for the Pacific Disaster Resilience \nProgram (Phase 3) on terms and conditions that are substantially in accordance with \nthose set forth in the draft grant agreement presented to the Board;  \n(ix)  the grant not exceeding $4,000,000 to Tuvalu from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources \n(Asian Development Fund) for the Pacific Disaster Resilience Program (Phase 3) on \nterms and conditions that are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the \ndraft grant agreement presented to the Board; and \n(x)  the grant not exceeding $5,000,000 to Republic of Vanuatu from ADB\u2019s Special \nFunds resources (Asian Development Fund) for the Pacific Disaster Resilience \nProgram (Phase 3) on terms and conditions that are substantially in accordance with \nthose set forth in the draft grant agreement presented to the Board. \n \nMasatsugu Asakawa \n                  President\n16 November 2020 \n ", "12  Appendix 1 \n \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nCountry\u2019s Overarching Development Objectives \nResilience to climate change and disasters, as well as disaster preparedness, response, and recovery \nstrengthened (Framework for Resilient Development in the Pacific, goals 1 and 3)a  \nCountry readiness and response operations for COVID-19 scaled up for containment and mitigation \n(COVID-19 Pacific Health Sector Support Plan Phase II, objective 1)b  \n \nPerformance Indicators with  Data Sources and \nResults Chain  Targets and Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms  Risks \nEffect of the  By June 2024:     \nReform  External shocks \na.
