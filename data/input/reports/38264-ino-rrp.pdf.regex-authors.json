Proposed TA Activities under LGFGR2 Program Cluster \n \n ", "", " \nLOAN AND PROGRAM SUMMARY \n \nBorrower  Republic of Indonesia \n   \nThe Proposal  A program cluster for the Second Local Government Finance \nand  Governance  Reform  Program  (LGFGR  2)  and  its  two \nsubprograms is proposed. It involves (i) a loan of $350 million \nequivalent for subprogram 1, and (ii) a technical assistance (TA) \ngrant of $1.5 million. \n   \nClassification  Targeting classification: General intervention \nSector: Law, economic management, and public policy \nSubsector: Public finance and expenditure management \nThemes:  Governance,  inclusive  social  development,  capacity \ndevelopment \nSubthemes:  Public  governance,  human  development, \norganizational development \n   \nEnvironment  Category C \nAssessment \n   \nProgram Rationale  Since 1999, the Government of Indonesia has introduced major \ndecentralization reforms that have devolved significant functional \nresponsibilities and funding from the central Government to the \nregional (provincial, district, and city) governments. The reforms \npursued, which in extent and speed have had few precedents \nelsewhere in the world, have been referred to as the \u201cbig bang\u201d \napproach to decentralization. After the early frantic years of rapid \npolicy and regulatory design and implementation, a more settled \npolicy and legal framework has gradually emerged. More recent \nefforts have increasingly gone into fine-tuning the basic policy \napproaches, adding more depth to the framework of laws (with \nlower-level regulations and instruments), and addressing the vital \nissue of strengthening the Government\u2019s human and systems \ncapacity. The new policy and legal approaches urgently need to \nbe managed to achieve the improvements that citizens expect, \nsuch as better social and physical services, and opportunities to \nbenefit from a much more robust economy. \n \nWhile  decentralization  has  administrative,  political,  and  other \ndimensions, LGFGR 2 focuses mainly on the fiscal dimension, \nwhere  implementation  is  critical  and  also  most  challenging. \nLGFGR  2  will  support  the  Government\u2019s  ongoing  efforts  to \nimprove regional autonomy and financing (by strengthening the \nintergovernmental  financing  policy  framework,  regional \norganizational  systems,  and  regional  revenue  systems), \ngovernance  and  service  delivery  (by  providing  adequate \nfinancing  and  performance  measurement),  and  capacity \ndevelopment  (by  improving  public  financial  management  and \nhuman capacity).  \n ", "ii   \nLGFGR  2  will  broaden  reforms  in  six  target  areas:  (i) \nstrengthening  the  management  and  coordination  of  fiscal \ndecentralization; (ii) clarifying regional administration to improve \nservices  and  accountability;  (iii)  making  the  release  of  fiscal \ntransfers  and  shared  revenues  more  equal,  predictable,  and \ntransparent; (iv) reducing regional dependency on fiscal transfers \nby developing more buoyant revenue sources; (v) bolstering the \nmanagement of regional reserves and debts; and (vi) developing \nhuman and systems capacity and strengthening public financial \nmanagement and accountability.  \n \nThe  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  supports  Indonesia \naccording to the country strategy and program 2006\u20132009 of (i) \npro-poor,  sustainable  economic  growth;  and  (ii)  social \ndevelopment.  Governance  improvements  and  anticorruption \nefforts are key themes. Decentralization and local government \nfinance and governance are key issues in this regard, and are \namong  the  five  key  operational  areas  of  engagement:  (i) \ninfrastructure, (ii) financial sector deepening, (iii) decentralization, \n(iv) achievement of Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), and \n(v)  environment  and  natural  resource  management.  The \nproposed  program  cluster  will  improve  decentralization  and \naccelerate  MDG  achievement  by  strengthening  regional \ngovernment  capacity  and  contributing  to  a  more  transparent, \neffective,  and  efficient  policy  and  legal  environment  for  fiscal \ndecentralization, financial management, and service delivery. A \njoint team from the Government and ADB has been working on \nthe reform program since early 2007. \n   \nImpact and Outcome  The  proposed  LGFGR  2  program  cluster  will  support  the \nGovernment in its efforts to make regional government spending \nand service delivery more efficient, effective, and equitable. It will \nstrengthen  the  organizational  capacity  of  the  regional \ngovernments  and  provide  a  more  transparent,  effective,  and \nefficient policy and legal environment for fiscal decentralization, \nfinancial management, and service delivery.  \n   \nFinancing Plan  A  loan  of  $350  million  equivalent  from  the  ordinary  capital \nresources of ADB will be provided for subprogram 1 of LGFGR 2 \nunder the London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)\u2013based lending \nfacility. The loan will have a term of 15 years, including a grace \nperiod of 3 years, an interest rate to be determined according to \nthe LIBOR-based lending facility, a yearly commitment charge of \n0.15%,  and  other  terms  and  conditions  set  forth  in  the  draft \nprogram loan agreement. ADB\u2019s Board of Directors has waived \nthe front-end fee of 1.00% for loans approved from 1 July 2007 \nthrough 30 June 2009. \n   \nPeriod and Tranching  The program cluster period is from January 2006 to December \n2011, with a single-tranche loan of $350 million equivalent to be ", "  iii\ndisbursed under subprogram 1 in 2008 when the Government \nshall have met the conditions for effectiveness. Subprogram 2 \nwill be submitted for Board consideration about 36 months after \nthe  effectiveness  of  subprogram  1,  subject  to  the  adequate \nprogress of reforms and the Government\u2019s readiness to continue \nwith its reform agenda. \n   \nCounterpart Funds  The Government will use the counterpart funds from the loan \nproceeds  to  meet  program  expenditures  and  the  associated \ncosts of local reforms. \n   \nExecuting Agency  Directorate General of Fiscal Balance of the Ministry of Finance \n(MOF) \n   \nImplementation  The implementing agencies will be directorates of (i) MOF, (ii) \nArrangements  the  Ministry  of  Home  Affairs  (MOHA),  and  (iii)  the  National \nDevelopment  Planning  Agency  (BAPPENAS).  An  LGFGR \nsteering  committee  (with  an  implementation  committee  and  a \nsecretariat  under  it)  has  been  formed  to  coordinate  the \nimplementation  of  the  LGFGR  program  reform  actions.  The \nsteering committee is chaired by the director general of fiscal \nbalance of MOF and has MOHA and BAPPENAS officials as \nmembers. Selected representatives from regional governments \nwill  attend  meetings  of  the  steering  and  implementation \ncommittees.  The  steering  committee  meets  at  least  semi \nannually to monitor progress and oversee the implementation of \nthe  program,  and  to  guide  and  direct  the  executing  and \nimplementing agencies.  \n   \nProcurement and  The loan of $350 million for LGFGR 2 subprogram 1 will be \nDisbursement  released  in  a  single  tranche  when  it  takes  effect.  The  loan \nproceeds will finance the full foreign exchange costs (excluding \nlocal duties and taxes) of items produced and procured in ADB \nmember countries. Ineligible items and imports financed from \nother bilateral and multilateral sources will not be covered by the \nloan.  The  loan  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  to  the  Borrower \naccording to ADB\u2019s Simplification of Disbursement Procedures \nand Related Requirements for Program Loans. Subprogram 1 \nwill provide for retroactive financing for expenditures incurred by \nthe Government 180 days before the loan takes effect. \n \nProgram Benefits and  LGFGR 2 will have significant benefits and positive effects on \nBeneficiaries  regional service delivery, financing, and capacity development. \nThe key expected benefits are as follows: \n(i)  Strengthened  management  and  coordination  of  fiscal \ndecentralization by the central Government, and improved \nleadership, supervision, and coordination of the capacity \ndevelopment of regional governments.  \n(ii)  Clearer  assignment  of  expenditures  between  levels  of \ngovernment  and  improved  criteria  for  establishing  new \n ", "iv   \nregional governments, leading to more efficient allocation \nof expenditures and better vertical balance in financing \nbetween levels of government. \n(iii)  Improved  technical  and  policy  environment  for \nintergovernmental fiscal transfers, revenue sharing, and \nlocal own-source revenues, leading to more transparent \nand equitable outcomes across regions (better horizontal \nbalance), and less dependence on central government \ntransfers. \n(iv)  Strengthened  management  of  regional  reserves  and \ndebts,  contributing  to  better  access  to  long-term \ninvestment financing for infrastructure. \n(v)  Enhanced organizational, systems, and human resource \ncapacity of regional governments, particularly to manage \nand report finances and to measure performance, thus \nimproving public service delivery and accountability.     \n(vi)  Strengthened  governance  through  coordinated \nperformance  monitoring  and  evaluation  to  improve \naccountability. \n   \nRisks and Assumptions  While some risks are external and political, the program design \nand TA will mitigate these and other risks by providing a strong \nbroad-based  governance  framework  with  transparency  and \naccountability  elements  in  both  the  central  and  regional \ngovernments. The potential risks to LGFGR 2 and the underlying \nassumptions are as follows: \n \n(i)  Regional government leadership and capacity.  The \nregional  governments  might  not  have  the  necessary \nleadership,  commitment,  and  capacity  to  innovate  and \nlearn and to translate financial resource and management \nsystems improvements into better services and reduced \npoverty. This risk will be mitigated by improvements in (a) \nbottom-up  accountability,  with  better  public  financial \nmanagement and greater transparency in reporting; (b) \nvertical  organizational  structures  and  hierarchical \nresponsibilities; (c) accountability of regional governments \nto oversight and coordination agencies; (d) accountability \nthrough the electoral process; and (e) the regional civil \nservice. \n(ii)  Political  change.  National  and  regional  government \nelections are due from 2009. The new national or regional \ngovernments may not endorse the policy framework in the \nNational Action Plan for Fiscal Decentralization (NAPFD) \nand  LGFGR  2.  But  the  political  and  bureaucratic \nmomentum of reforms has been significant and growing \nwith the rise of reform champions, and is unlikely to be \ncompletely  reversed  by  a  new  administration.  Some \nallowance  must,  however,  be  made  for  new  policy \napproaches at the margins.  \n ", "  v\n(iii)  National  coordination.  Problems  in  coordination \nbetween key national agencies could still delay program \nimplementation despite the improvements made so far. \nThis risk has been mitigated by the emergence of the new \nDirectorate General of Fiscal Balance as the leader in \nfiscal  aspects  of  decentralization  and  the  longer-term \ncapacity-building efforts of the directorate general and the \npresident\u2019s Regional Autonomy Advisory Council (DPOD). \nMoreover, all key stakeholders will take part in revising \nthe NAPFD in 2009, enhancing national approaches. \n(iv)  Flexibility  of  regional  organizational  structures. \nOrganizations  and  their  staff  may  resist  more  flexible \norganizational arrangements and staffing. This resistance \nis likely to be offset by orderly and socially acceptable \nrightsizing, combined with growing community support for \nspending less resources on unproductive administration \nand more on productive activities. \n(v)  Horizontal equity between regions. Political and other \npressures could delay the more equitable distribution of \ntransfers  and  shared  revenues,  and  benefit  relatively \nbetter-off,  natural  resource\u2013endowed  regions.  But \nequalization  has  gained  important  momentum  with  the \nremoval of the \u201chold harmless\u201d provisions of the general \nequalization grant in 2008, and improved analysis and \ntransparency  in  intergovernmental  financial  flows  will \nincrease accountability and create a larger constituency in \nfavor of further equalization. \n   \nTechnical Assistance  For subprogram 2, the Government has asked ADB for a $1.5 \nmillion  policy  and  advisory  technical  assistance  (TA)  to  be \nattached  to  this  program.  The  TA  will  support  the  ongoing \ndevelopment  of  the  reform  agenda  in  regional  government \nfinancing  and  governance  (contained  in  the  NAPFD  and  the \npolicy  matrix  for  subprogram  2)  and  its  implementation,  and \nprovide  timely  policy  advice  to  the  Government  as  needed. \nMedium-term support for the reform agenda is expected to come \nfrom another TA. \n \nThe attached TA will center on the Directorate General of Fiscal \nBalance and will include the following components: (i) extending \nthe NAPFD to 2010\u20132014, (ii) building a database and financial \nmodeling  capacity  in  the  directorate  general  to  support  the \nongoing review of intergovernmental transfers, (iii) designing and \nimplementing  a  system  of  forward  estimates  for \nintergovernmental  transfers  and  shared  revenues,  (iv) \ndeveloping and disseminating new regulations and guidelines for \nthe  specific  allocation  fund  (DAK),  (v)  developing  and \nimplementing a targeted package of incentives and sanctions for \nselected  intergovernmental  transfers,  (vi)  supporting  the  early \nstages of devolution of the property tax, and (vii) human and \nsystems capacity building in decentralized locations. About 24 \n ", "vi   \nperson-months of international and 80 person-months of national \nconsulting services will be required for the TA. All the consultants \nwill be recruited and hired according to ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the \nUse of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time).  \n \nThe second TA of $1 million for subprogram 2 policy actions is \nexpected to be processed separately in 2009. Subject to more \ndetailed  consultations  with  the  Government,  the  TA  will  (i) \nexplore further policy options for the future status of DPOD; (ii) \nstudy more efficient uses of regional government labor resources \nby  determining  the  wage  bill  formula  and  giving  regional \ngovernments discretion in the use of general allocation fund; (iii) \nfurther support the amendment of sector laws and regulations to \nmake  them  consistent  with  the  new  expenditure  assignments \nand  other  decentralization  laws;  (iv)  support  a  creditworthy \nregional government in planning regional bond issues through \ntraining, due diligence studies, and document preparation; (v) \npilot-test  and  roll  out  the  regional  government  performance \nmeasurement system and train regional government staff to use \nthe system; (vi) support the restructuring of regional government \nbudgets through the closure or privatization of low-priority and \nnonperforming  activities  and  assets,  including  regional \nenterprises, and other means; and (vii) inventory the financial \nmanagement information systems in 171 regional governments \nand review options for their further expansion. \n \n ", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on: (i) a proposed \nprogram cluster for the Government of Indonesia\u2019s Second Local Government Finance and \nGovernance Reform Program (LGFGR 2), and (ii) a proposed loan for subprogram 1 of LGFGR \n2.  Subprogram  1  was  prepared  by  a  joint  team  from  the  Government  and  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB). This report also describes proposed technical assistance (TA) for the \ncapacity development of fiscal decentralization agencies. If the Board approves the proposed \nloan, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, will approve the TA (para 87). \nThe program design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \nII.  THE MACROECONOMIC CONTEXT  \n2.  Indonesia\u2019s economic performance strengthened further in 2007, when economic growth \naccelerated to a 10-year high of 6.3% despite a slowing global economy. Unlike previously, \neconomic  growth  appeared  to  be  more  employment-friendly:  unemployment  declined  from \n10.3% in 2006 to 9.1% in 2007. The growth was propelled by a strong pickup in investment due \nto the progress of reforms and improvement in business perception. High growth was also \nsupported by stronger export performance, attributed to high prices of commodities, particularly \ncoal and palm oil. The government budget deficit at the end of 2007 was 1.3% of gross \ndomestic product (GDP), and the debt-to-GDP ratio, in a continued rapid decline, was around \n35%, down from 39% in 2006.  \n \n3.  In 2007, inflation ended at 6.6%, close to the upper end of the Bank Indonesia target. \nHowever, since the start of 2008, inflation has been on the rise, reaching 11.85% in August \n2008. Inflationary pressure has been driven primarily by external factors related to escalating \ninternational prices of food and commodities. Until late May 2008, inflation was insulated from \nsurging international prices by the domestic fuel subsidy. The 29% increase in fuel prices \nannounced recently by the Government may exert further inflationary pressure. In response to \nthe rising inflation, Bank Indonesia progressively increased its rate by 150 basis points to 9.50% \nin October 2008 and has declared its intent to adjust future rates as appropriate to manage \ninflation expectations. Table 1 presents the key macroeconomic indicators for Indonesia. \n \n4.  The  rising  international  fuel  prices  have  generated  heavy  pressure  on  the  central \ngovernment budget. Under the current regime of administered pricing, the prices of over two \nthirds of fuel sold\u2014gasoline, transportation diesel, and kerosene\u2014have been fixed since 2005. \nAs a result, government spending on energy subsidies has grown rapidly and is estimated to \nhave  gone  up  to  4.2%  of  GDP  in  2008,  versus  the  budgeted  1.8%.  While  the  continued \nescalation in international fuel prices helps the central Government on the revenue side, its \noverall impact on the budget is negative. Measures have been proposed to cut line-ministry \nsubsidies to electricity and to ration kerosene so that it goes only to the poor. These measures \nand the fuel price increase are expected to reduce the budget deficit from the budgeted 1.7% of \nGDP to about 1.3% of GDP. As international oil prices are expected to stay volatile and difficult \nto predict, the Government is committed to the longer-term goal of pricing energy at market \nrates to promote efficiency and safeguard its fiscal position. \n \n5.  If  high  commodity  prices  and  the  risk  of  a  global  economic  slowdown  persist,  the \neconomic outlook will be one of considerable challenge. However, Indonesia is expected to \nweather the global slowdown reasonably well in the short term with growth slowing slightly to ", "2 \n6.2% in 2008. Going forward in 2009, growth is projected to weaken due to protracted global \nfinancial  crisis.  Increased  exchange  rate  flexibility,  adequate  reserves,  improved  export \ndiversity, declining external debt, and the recent preemptive actions taken by the Government \nshould cushion the negative effects of external shocks. Although export growth is projected to \nslow  somewhat  in  2008,  domestic  demand,  especially  investment,  should  remain  robust\u2014\nrealized investment in the first half of 2008 was up by 81%. Consumption could weaken slightly \nin response to higher inflation, but is expected to remain strong. With continued strong growth, \nthe  debt-to-GDP  ratio  is  projected  to  decline  further  to  33%  by  the  end  of  2008.  On  the \ndownside, without further adjustments in fuel prices, higher international fuel prices will continue \nto pose significant risk to the central government budget. On the upside, further progress in \nimplementing structural reforms and removing bottlenecks to infrastructure investment would \nperk up growth. Consistent implementation of fiscal decentralization reforms would also help \nimprove domestic investment.  \n \nTable 1: Key Macroeconomic Indicators for Indonesia, 2005\u20132008  \n \n  Year \nItem  2003  2004  2005  2006  2007  2008a \nA.

The  national  medium-term  development  plan  (Rencana  Pembangunan  Jangka \nMenengah, or RPJM) for 2005\u20132009 is centered on poverty reduction through higher growth \nwith job creation and environmental sustainability, and on activities and investments aimed at \nachieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Five priority areas are identified in the \nplan: (i) job creation and poverty reduction, (ii) macroeconomic stability with fiscal sustainability \nand financial sector reforms, (iii) accelerated investments and exports with the help of a healthy \nbusiness climate, (iv) improved access to better-quality education and health services, and (v) \ninfrastructure development with greater participation from the private sector. For these reforms \nto bear fruit, the Government must increase its development spending to spur economic growth, \nreduce poverty, and achieve the MDGs more quickly. Recognizing the critical role of regional \ngovernments in sustained growth and poverty reduction, the Government, in 2005, launched a \ncomprehensive National Action Plan for Fiscal Decentralization (NAPFD) setting out medium-\nterm decentralization reforms. \n \n7.  ADB\u2019s country strategy and program (CSP) for 2006\u201320091 is fully aligned with the \nRPJM aiming at higher yet sustainable and pro-poor growth and social development for the \ncountry, with particular emphasis on good governance and anticorruption measures. There are \nfive core areas of engagement: (i) infrastructure and infrastructure services, (ii) financial sector \ndeepening,  (iii)  decentralization,  (iv)  MDG  achievement,  and  (v)  environment  and  natural \nresource management. The CSP uses innovative approaches including single-tranche cluster \nprogram lending. For investment projects, multitranche financing facilities in several sectors \nprovide  long-term  investment  and  policy  engagement.  Supporting  TA  clusters  align  the \nassistance with emerging demands and allow more flexibility. \n \n8.  Following on from the first LGFGR program, LGFGR 2 continues to tackle major policy \nissues in a medium- to longer-term framework to improve the implementation of decentralization \npolicy  as  envisioned  in  the  RPJM,  the  NAPFD,  and  the  CSP.  It  strengthens  government \ninstitutions  that  directly  support  regional  development  while  deepening  reforms  in  fiscal \nconsolidation, good governance, public financial management, and service delivery down to the \nregional  governments.2 LGFGR  2  also  complements  the  broader  policy  support  from  the \nDevelopment Policy Support Program (DPSP).3 ADB provides a comprehensive package of \nsupport for the Government\u2019s overall objectives of poverty reduction and equitable growth. \nFigure 1 captures the links between the RPJM, the NAPFD, LGFGR 1 and 2, and the CSP. \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2006.

THE SECTOR \nA.  Review of the Sector and Performance \n9.  Sector Review Backed by Significant Diagnostic Study. Apart from the experience \ngained directly under LGFGR 1 and diagnostic work on fiscal aspects of decentralization during \nCSP preparation in 2006, the design of LGFGR 2 has benefited from a significant amount of \nsector diagnostic study done between 2006 and 2008 on the fiscal aspects of decentralization. \nThis work involved: (i) a comprehensive stock taking of fiscal decentralization, undertaken jointly \n ", "5 \nby funding agencies and the Government;4 (ii) a diagnostic review of issues and the preparation \nof a medium-term work plan for the Decentralization Support Facility (DSF);5 (iii) an extensive \ndiagnostic review of priority reforms to be considered in designing LGFGR 2 and the project \npreparatory TA for LGFGR 2;6 (iv) a public expenditure review with emphasis on the fiscal \naspects of decentralization;7 and (v)  various internal government reviews (some supported by \nADB TA projects) made to assess progress in implementing LGFGR 1 and the NAPFD. \n \n10.   Evolving Administrative and Legal Framework. In the aftermath of the economic and \npolitical upheavals of the late 1990s, the Government introduced major decentralization reforms \nthat have devolved significant authority, functional responsibilities, and funding from the central \nGovernment to provincial and local governments. The \u201cbig bang\u201d reforms launched in 2001 \ninvolved a massive delegation of responsibility for the provision of public services and the \nreassignment of two thirds of central government civil servants and more than 16,000 service \ndelivery  facilities  to  the  regional  governments.  Regional  government  expenditures  almost \ndoubled,  making  Indonesia  one  of  the  most-decentralized  countries  in  the  world,  with  its \nregional  governments  managing  more  than  40%  of  total  government  expenditure.8 Not \nsurprisingly, the transition to such a radically different system of governance has been far from \nsmooth. Over the last 6 years, there has been continuous reform and fine-tuning. Observers \nbelieve that the constant need for change arose because Indonesia did not prepare a white \npaper setting the overall design and framework for decentralization.9 Without such a road map, \nthere is a tendency to \u201cmake it up as we go along,\u201d leading to pieces of decentralization strategy \nthat may not fit together. In addition, later policy changes may not be consistent with the overall \ngoals of fiscal decentralization. A case in point is the \u201chold harmless\u201d system that was put in \nplace by the house of representatives (Dewan Perwakilan Rakyat, or DPR) to protect regional \ngovernments from a reduction in revenues once the new formula-based intergovernmental \ngrants were introduced. The system compromised the equalization effects of the grant and \nperpetuated perverse wage incentives. Although the fiscal architecture is far from complete, the \nGovernment as a matter of policy has turned away from building up the decentralization system \nand toward fine-tuning the system to improve governance and service delivery.  \n \n11.  Decentralization reforms in Indonesia formally began in 1999 with the passage of two \nfundamental  laws:  (i)  a  law  on  local  administration  (law  22/1999),  which  spelled  out  the \nfunctional responsibilities and administrative structures of regional governments and defined \ntheir autonomy; and (ii) a law on financial balance between the central Government and the \nregions  (law  25/1999),  which  dealt  with  revenue  sources,  including  transfers  and  revenue \nassignments  and  other  aspects  of  fiscal  relations.  Under  these  laws,  decentralization  in \nIndonesia took shape with several distinctive features. As far as organizational structure was \nconcerned,  local  governments  were  not  hierarchically  linked  to  provincial  governments; \nexecutive and legislative bodies were elected at each level, leaving the door open for the \ncreation (proliferation) of new regional governments. Regarding expenditure assignments, the \ncentral Government reserved for itself a very short list of national responsibilities (international \n                                                 \n4  Development Support Facility, Asian Development Bank, US Agency for International Development, and Australian \nAgency  for  International  Development.  2006.

Local governments deliver public services in most \nsectors\u2014public works, health, education and culture, communication, industry and trade, capital \ninvestment,  environment,  land,  cooperatives,  and  labor.  Regional  governments  have \nconsiderable discretion in managing and delivering services. However, because of widespread \nfailure to adapt sectoral laws (on education, public health, etc.) to the new decentralization \nprinciples, line ministries and other central government agencies continue to provide services \nand undertake expenditures in areas that have been decentralized.  \n \n12.  Law 34/2000 grants taxation and revenue powers to regional governments but gives \nthem little meaningful revenue autonomy. Although regional governments can introduce their \nown  taxes,  such  taxes  have  to  meet  \u201cgood  tax\u201d  criteria  defined  in  the  law.  The  central \nGovernment has kept control of the main taxes, and new taxes introduced by the regional \ngovernments tend to be nuisance taxes, distorting domestic trade and economic activity. Under \nthe law, new regional taxes are reviewed by the central Government, which holds ultimate \npower of revocation. The DPR is considering amending law 34/2000 and including a closed-list \napproach to regional taxes to rein in nuisance taxes. The main source of financing for regional \ngovernments has been transfers, notably from revenue sharing but mostly from the general \nallocation fund (Dana Alokasi Umum, or DAU), which was conceived fundamentally as an \nequalization grant. For many years, however, the larger share of this grant has been distributed \nnot according to the equalization formula but rather to finance public sector employees and \nother objectives. \n \n13.  This  original  framework  was  reconstructed  in  2004,  when  parliament  approved  law \n32/2004 amending law 22/1999 on regional autonomy, and law 33/2004 amending law 25/1999 \non regional fiscal relations. In particular, law 32/2004 reestablished a hierarchical role for the \nprovinces vis-\u00e0-vis the districts and cities. Regional planning, budgeting, financial management, \nand oversight have also undergone significant reforms with the passing of new central finance, \ntreasury,  planning,  and  audit  laws  in  2003\u20132005,  followed  by  a  raft  of  new  lower-level \nregulations.10 The new legal requirements are being gradually introduced in the regions, and \nmodern budgeting and financial management approaches are being put in place in areas such \nas  budget  unification,  treasury  management,  medium-term  programming  and  performance-\nbased planning and budgeting, and enhanced monitoring, evaluation, and internal and external \naudit of performance outcomes. Over time, the LGFGR program cluster and related projects \nfunded by the Government and development partners seek to significantly enhance institutional, \nsystems,  and  human  resource  capacity  to  achieve  the  desired  outcomes  from  the  new \napproaches to public financial management (PFM) that have been put in place. \n \n14.  Figure  2  sets  out  the  basic  structure  of  the  regional  government  system,  with  33 \nprovinces, 95 municipalities (kota), 370 districts (kabupaten), and about 73,458 villages (desa \nand kelurahan). Provinces, districts, and municipalities all have their own elected heads of \ngovernment  (governor,  bupati,  and  mayor,  respectively)  as  well  as  their  own  elected \nrepresentative  bodies  (Dewan  Perwakilan  Rakyat  Daerah,  or  DPRD).  The  subdistricts \n(kecamatan)  are  administrative  arms  of  the  districts  and  municipalities,  while  the  villages \noperate at the community level with elected heads. The main central government coordinating \nand supervising bodies are: (i) the Ministry of Finance (MOF); (ii) the National Development \nPlanning  Agency  (Badan  Perencanaan  Pembangunan  Nasional,  or  BAPPENAS);  (iii)  the \n                                                 \n10  More than 50 new presidential, government, and ministry regulations and decrees relating to fiscal decentralization \nwere passed from 2005 to mid-2008.  \n ", "7 \nMinistry  of  Home  Affairs  (MOHA);  (iv)  the  Supreme  Audit  Authority  (Badan  Pemeriksa \nKeuangan,  or  BPK);  and  (v)  the  president\u2019s Regional  Autonomy  Advisory  Council  (Dewan \nPertimbangan  Otonomi  Daerah,  or  DPOD).

The council advises the president on regional \nautonomy policy regarding: (i) the establishment, abolition, or merger of regional governments; \n(ii) the assessment of regional government performance; (iii) the assignment of functions; and \n(iv) fiscal balance matters, including the DAU and shared-revenue allocations. The longer-term \nstrengthening of the DPOD is an important objective of LGFGR 2. \n \n \nFigure 2: Structure of the Regional Government System in Indonesia \n  \n  Central Go vernment   \n              (Pusa t)         \n \n \n \n \n              Provin ces          \n  (Propinsi) \n  (33) \n \n \n   \n        Di stricts          Mu nicipalitie s   \n  (Kabupaten)  (Kota) \n  (370)  (95) \n \n \n  Subdis  tricts  Subdis  tricts \n        (Kec amatan)         (K ecamatan )   \n  (635)  (635) \n \n \n   \nVillages \n  Villa ges  (Kelurahan) \n  (Desa)  (4,865) \n  (68,593) \n \n \n       Source: Central Bureau of Statistics (BPS), as of the end of 2007.   \n \n   \n15.  Increasingly Decentralized Service Delivery. Regional governments have assumed \nthe key role in the delivery of core services, including education, health, and the development of \nbasic  infrastructure  such  as  waterworks  and  roads.  An  important  issue  is  the  impact  of \ndecentralization on the quantity and quality of those services. While decentralization is relatively \nnew, a preliminary assessment at least can be made at this time. The performance of the \nregional governments can be evaluated from (i) an expenditure perspective (has there been an \nadequate increase in expenditures allocated to decentralized services, i.e., have funds followed \nfunctions?); (ii) an expenditure composition perspective (is there a desirable mix or composition \nof  expenditures?);  or  (iii)  a  service  delivery  perspective  (has  the  quality  of  services \nimproved?).11  \n                                                 \n11  Unless stated otherwise, fiscal data in this report are drawn from the MOF regional financial information system \n(SIKD), the Central Bureau of Statistics (BPS), and the Supreme Audit Authority (BPK). \n ", "8 \n16.  Expenditure Levels. National education expenditures now approach 4% of GDP, up \nfrom 2% in 2001. With close to 17% of total public expenditures going to education, the country \nis spending at good standard international levels, adjusted for income per capita. The lion\u2019s \nshare of growth in education expenditures has been in the local governments, from negligible \nlevels in 2000 to more than 2% of GDP recently. But central government expenditures have not \ndecreased very significantly (from about 1.3% of GDP in 2000 to 0.9% recently). Much local \nexpenditure is on teacher salaries, with a simple switch in administrative responsibilities from \ncentral to local. Total expenditures on public health have increased moderately in recent years \nbut are still less than 2% of GDP, little changed from 2001 and quite low by international \nstandards. Regional government expenditure on public health did increase sharply after 2001 \n(11.5% of sector expenditures in 2000 and 42.9% in 2006). But this was largely offset by \ndecreases  in  health  expenditures  by  the  central  Government  (from  64.3%  of  sector \nexpenditures in 2000 to 41.2% in 2006), while the provincial governments\u2019 share has declined, \nfrom 24.2% in 2000 to 15.8% in 2006. Public investment declined from 7% of GDP in 1996 to \nless than 3% in 2001 and has only recently recovered to pre-crisis levels of about 7% of GDP. \nIn 2000\u20132006, central government public investment grew from 2.2% of GDP to 2.7% of GDP; \nlocal  investment  over  this  period  grew  more  rapidly,  from  1.3%  to  2.8%,  while  provincial \ninvestment grew from 0.3% to 1.0% of GDP.  \n \n17.   Functional  Composition  of  Expenditures.  The  current  composition  of  regional \nexpenditures is still less than optimal. While education has become the most important sector in \nregional budgets, expenditures on public health have not increased significantly. Government \nadministration  expenditures  are  the  second  most  important  in  regional  budgets.  Regional \ngovernments still spend too little on infrastructure, with central government agencies continuing \nto control about 50% of infrastructure spending. Low spending on basic infrastructure services \nhas been complicated by two factors. One, regional governments\u2019 routine expenditures account \nfor 65% of total expenditures and a very high proportion of these go solely to personnel costs. \nTwo, much too little is spent on supplies and equipment. Health clinics, for example, often lack \nbasic medications, clean water, and electricity.  \n \n18.  Service  Delivery.  In  the  little  time  that  has  passed  since  the  launching  of \ndecentralization reforms in 2001, service delivery performance has been mixed from the limited \nevidence available, but there are indications that the quality of some services has improved. A \nrecent World Bank survey12 concluded that decentralized services in education, health, and \ngeneral administration have improved in quality while police services, which have not been \ndecentralized, have deteriorated. But the survey evidence is merely indicative and has to be \nconfirmed  by  longer-term  trends  in  objective  indicators,  which  are  still  being  developed. \nBesides,  before  2001,  access  to  many  basic  services  was  very  low,  so  any  significant \nimprovement will take time to occur. For example, household access to water, sanitation, and \nelectricity is among the lowest in the region, with only 18% of households having access to \npiped running water and continued slow growth in the number of families with access to safe \nsanitation (18.2 million families in 2003 and 19.4 million in 2005). Although many state-owned \nwater supply companies (Perusahaan Daerah Air Minum, or PDAMs) have major financial \nproblems, there was a modest increase in PDAM customers of 11.4% from 2001 to 2005. The \nnumber of households with access to public water taps also grew by 18.2% from 2001 to 2005. \n \n19.  In education, Indonesia ranks well internationally at the primary level, with net enrollment \nrates recently (2005) increasing to 95.5%, but is doing less well in junior secondary (65.2%) and \n                                                 \n12  World Bank. 2006. Decentralization, Governance and Public Services in Indonesia. Jakarta: Kaiser, Pattinasarany \nand Schulze. \n ", "9 \nsenior secondary school (41.7%). Adult literacy is showing some improvement, from 89.3% in \n2001 to 90.9% in 2005, although there are wide regional differences. Trends in the quality of \neducation outcomes still need longer-term assessment. Many health indicators remain poor by \ninternational standards: among the countries in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations \nregion Indonesia has the fewest physicians for every 100,000 people. Ratios for nurses and \nmidwives are somewhat better, but again the distribution varies greatly between regions. On the \nother hand, infant and child mortality rates show good improvement since decentralization. The \ninfant mortality rate fell from 60 per 1,000 live births in 2000 to 28 per 1,000 live births in 2005. \nLife  expectancy  has  also  improved,  particularly  in  poorer  provinces like  Papua,  where  life \nexpectancy improved from 62.7 years in 1996 to 67.3 years in 2005. \n \n20.  Social Indicators. More aggregated indicators like poverty trends may show how well \ndecentralized governance has succeeded, even if the latter is only one of many forces that \naffect poverty trends. According to the Central Bureau of Statistics (Badan Pusat Statistik, or \nBPS), the poverty headcount ratio has dropped sharply in relative terms since the start of \ndecentralization  (from  23.4%  in  1999  to  16.6%  in  2007).  But  richer  and  poorer  regional \ngovernments have not improved in the same way: poverty in poorer and mainly agricultural \nregions is still quite high. At the extremes, 4.6% of the population in Jakarta and 40.8% in \nPapua were considered poor in 2007.  \n \n21.  Trends  in  Vertical  and  Horizontal  Balance.  These  trends  offer  another  way  of \nassessing the performance of the decentralization system. As shown in Table 2, total resources \navailable to all regional governments grew strongly from 6.9% of GDP in 2001 (Rp103.4 trillion) \nto 8.4% of GDP in 2006 (Rp279.0 trillion) and are thought to have grown further since. All forms \nof revenue have grown sharply in absolute terms. However, in its share of resources the DAU \ndeclined somewhat in importance from 2001 to 2006 (but was still 52.2% of total resources in \n2006), while resource growth for regional governments has come mainly from the specific \nallocation fund (Dana Alokasi Khusus, or DAK), at 4.1% of total resources in 2006 (up from \n1.1% in 2001), and shared revenues, at 23.3% in 2006 (versus 21.0% in 2001). Most regions \narguably  have  enough  resources  to  make  a  difference  in  the  lives  of  their  citizens.

The centerpiece of intergovernmental financing since 2001 has been the unconditional \nequalization grant, the DAU. Despite political impositions on its implementation (e.g., the \u201chold \nharmless\u201d provision,13 links to payment of wages and salaries), this system of transfers has \nreduced  fiscal  disparities  across  regional  governments.  The  equalization  effects  of  these \ntransfers could have been much more substantial, however, if the \u201chold harmless\u201d provision had \nbeen  phased  out  before  2008,  and  the  entire  DAU  pool  had  been  dedicated  strictly  to \nequalization. As shown in Table 3, the total DAU has increased sharply, from Rp60.7 trillion in \n2001 to Rp179.8 trillion in 2008, but has remained relatively constant at about 4% of GDP over \nthis period. For all regional governments, the DAU provided 52.2% of total resources in 2006, \ndown from 58.7% in 2001, with the main alternative growth in funding coming from DAK and \nshared revenues. Data on total per capita resources and per capita expenditures show sizable \ndifferences between regions. In 2006 at the extremes Papua province spent about 17 times as \nmuch per capita than the lowest-spending province (Jawah Tengah). Expenditure disparities \nbetween the highest-spending district (Kabupaten Sarmi in Papua) and the lowest-spending \ndistrict (Kabupaten Bogor in Jawah Barat) are even wider, at a ratio of 50 to 1 in 2006.  \n \nTable 3: DAU Transfers to Provinces, Districts, and Cities, 2001\u20132008 \n \n2001  2002  2003  2004  2005  2006  2007  2008 \nItem  Actual  Actual  Actual  Actual  Actual  Actual  Actual  Actual \n(In Rp Billion)                 \nTransfers to Provinces    6,462.9    7,351.3    8,288.4    8,698.6    9,183.0    14,571.4    16,478.7    17,980.7 \nTransfers to Districts  54,279.1  62,202.7  70,230.4  73,328.9  80,170.4  131,114.1  148,308.7  161,769.3 \nand Cities \nTotal DAU  60,742.0  69,554.0  78,518.8  82,027.5  89,353.3  145,685.4  164,787.4  179,750.0 \n% Growth           14.5         12.9           4.5           8.9           63.0           13.1             9.1 \n(As % of Total GDP)               \nTransfers to Provinces         0.43         0.40         0.41         0.38         0.33           0.44           0.42           0.40 \nTransfers to Districts         3.6         3.4         3.5         3.2         2.9           3.9           3.7           3.6 \nand Cities \nTotal DAU         4.1         3.8         3.9         3.6         3.2           4.4           4.2           4.0 \nDAU = general allocation fund, GDP = gross domestic product. \nSources: Central Bureau of Statistics (BPS), Supreme Audit Authority of Indonesia (BPK), MOF regional financial \ninformation system (SIKD), central government financial report (LKPP). \n \n23.  Despite the low revenue autonomy granted to regional governments, revenue sharing, \nthe DAU, and other transfers have helped close the vertical fiscal gap between the central \nGovernment  and  regional  governments,  but  the  horizontal  gap  has  widened  since  2001, \nespecially among local governments. Because of recent increases in oil and gas revenues, \nresource-rich regions and those receiving special autonomy grants, like Aceh, Maluku, and \nPapua,  have  seen  very  rapid  growth  in  shared  revenues.  As  shown  in  Table  4,  central \ngovernment revenue sharing with all regional governments rose sharply from Rp21.7 billion in \n2001 (1.5% of GDP) to Rp65.1 billion in 2006 (2.0% of GDP). Revenue sharing is now almost \nhalf of DAU levels and, since much of it is dispersed inequitably (on derivation principles), is a \nmajor countervailing force to DAU equalization. \n \n24.  The decentralization system is still not doing enough to reduce the horizontal fiscal \ndisparities. The disparities between regions in public services and standards of living are still \nquite  considerable  (see  para.  22).  The  Government  is  therefore  emphasizing  regional \ndevelopment policies as the most effective way to bring about more geographic balance and to \nreduce poverty in poorer areas of the country. In a momentous step forward, the Government \n                                                 \n13 Under the \u201chold harmless\u201d provision, the DAU allocation to a region could not be lower than the previous year\u2019s \nallocation. \n ", "11 \neffectively removed the \u201chold harmless\u201d clause from the 2008 budget, thus weakening DAU \nfunding for better-off (mainly resource-rich) regional governments to the benefit of regional \ngovernments that were less well off and strengthening the equalization aspects of such funding.  \n  \nTable 4: Regional Share of National Tax and Non-tax Revenues \n(Including Natural Resources),  2001\u20132008  \n \n2001  2002  2003  2004  2005  2006 \nItem  Actual  Actual  Actual  Actual  Actual  Actual \n(In Rp Billion)             \nShared with Provinces      7,511.3       8,399.5       9,959.1     11,647.2     15,514.0     18,412.2 \nShared with Districts and Cities    14,177.5     15,906.6     20,830.8     22,424.0     34,315.0     46,694.8 \nTotal Shared    21,688.8     24,309.1     30,790.0     34,071.2     49,829.0     65,107.0 \n% Growth              12.1            26.7            10.7            46.2            30.7 \n(As % of Total GDP)             \nShared with Provinces            0.50            0.46            0.49            0.51            0.56            0.55 \nShared with Districts and Cities            1.0            0.9            1.0            1.0            1.2            1.4 \nTotal Shared            1.5            1.3            1.5            1.5            1.8            2.0 \na Excludes transfers from the provinces.  \nSources: Central Bureau of Statistics (BPS), Supreme Audit Authority of Indonesia (BPK), MOF regional financial \ninformation system (SIKD), central government financial report (LKPP). \nB.  Issues and Opportunities \n25.  The extensive diagnostic work undertaken jointly by ADB and the Government in 2006 \nand 2007 revealed highly important policy issues, which can be appropriately sequenced for \nreform during the LGFGR 2 period. The more important of these are set out below and are also \naddressed in part IV (Proposed Program). Appendix 5 and Supplementary Appendix A provide \ndetailed analyses of fiscal decentralization, service delivery, and governance issues.  \n \n26.  Proliferation  of  New  Regional  Governments.  A  noticeable  feature  of  Indonesia\u2019s \ndecentralization system is the proliferation of regional governments. Six new provinces and \nmore than 100 local governments have been created since 1999, and many more proposals are \nwaiting in the wings. This trend, partly an opportunistic response to fiscal incentives in the \nsystem, particularly the sharing of resource revenues, is widely perceived to reduce the overall \nefficiency of regional governments. Recent policies have slowed down new approvals, and then \nimposed a moratorium (since lifted) on approvals pending the completion of a revised policy \nframework. The costs of proliferation are considerable: economies of scale are lost in the \ndelivery  of  public  services,  unit  costs  go  up,  and  the  new  governments,  lacking  a  sound \neconomic base to raise their own revenues, could end up depending even more on transfers \nfrom the center. On the other hand, local residents gain more representation and access to their \nlocal representatives, and regional governments are pushed to become more accountable and \nefficient in their daily operations. Where the new regional governments lie in the balance of \nefficiency considerations versus enhanced representation and accountability remains an open \nquestion pending further study, now under way.  \n \n27.  Vertical Structure of Subnational Governments. The first decentralization reforms \nremoved hierarchical relationships between the provinces and the districts and cities. But more \nrecent reforms under law 32/2004 have introduced new forms of hierarchical control by the \nprovinces, including the approval of the annual budgets of local governments. These policy \nchanges are motivated by a perceived need to strengthen central oversight and control over the \nlocal governments through the provincial authorities, especially the governors. The new setup \nhas  benefits,  but  there  are  costs  as  well,  including  biased  actions  by  intermediate-level \n ", "12 \ngovernments against local governments and the difficulty of finding a true proxy that would \npursue the policy objectives of the central Government vis-\u00e0-vis the local governments. The \npros  and  cons  of  reverting  to  hierarchical  relationships  between  provincial  and  local \ngovernments must therefore be carefully assessed.  \n \n28.  Expenditure  Assignments.  Government  functions  are  imprecisely  defined. \nLaw 22/1999, taking an all-inclusive approach to the responsibilities of regional governments, \nsimply listed the exclusive functions of the central Government and did not make clear which \nother functions were obligatory and which were optional for regional governments. Sector laws \nin decentralized functional areas were never amended to conform to the decentralization laws. \nFull clarification of the obligatory functions of regional governments was also not made in law \n32/2004 but instead was deferred until the issuance of government regulation 38/2007. Over \ntime, line ministries and other central agencies have encroached on expenditure functions that \nhad apparently been assigned to regional governments by using \u201cdeconcentrated funds.\u201d Thus, \nthere  is  confusion  in  expenditure  assignments  of  responsibilities  and,  at  times,  opposing \ndirections in central government policy objectives. For example, while the central Government \nhas pursued regional equalization through the DAU, the regional distribution of deconcentrated \nfunds has tended to widen the fiscal disparities by generally benefiting regional governments \nthat are better off. Policies, sector laws, and regulations must be better aligned with this new \nregulation. This work has begun in some pilot ministries. It remains to be seen, however, \nwhether the new government regulation indeed clarifies expenditure assignments, particularly in \nareas of joint responsibility, and whether it has sufficient legal standing to reverse or nullify laws.   \n \n29.   Revenue Assignments. Reforms have so far failed to give the regional governments \nsignificant tax autonomy. Hence, political accountability among these governments is low, public \nservice  delivery  less  efficient,  and  fiscal  responsibility  diminished.  In  2006,  provincial \nown-source revenues (Pendapatan Asli Daerah, or PAD) made up 42.5% of provincial revenues \nwhile local government PAD represented only 5.9% of total local revenues. These proportions \nhave not changed much since 2001.14 Law 34/2000 allows regional governments to impose \ntheir  own  taxes  and  charges  subject  to  limited  monitoring  and  control  by  the  central \nGovernment. Nuisance taxes have often been the result. Draft revisions in law 34/2000 now \npending before the DPR restrict the taxes and charges levied by regional governments to a \npredetermined (or closed) list. However, two questions remain: whether the closed list of taxes \nwill  offer  substantial  traditional  tax  bases  to  the  regional  governments,  and  whether  the \nGovernment  will  set  aside  enough  resources  for  monitoring  compliance  and  reducing  the \nnuisance taxes and charges.  \n \n30.  Any  further  devolution  of  taxing  powers  must  recognize  the  limited  administrative \ncapacity and high collection inefficiency of many regional governments. The best candidate for \ndevolution remains the property tax, now administered fully by the central Government, which \ndefines the tax base and sets the rates and then distributes the collected revenues among the \nregional governments, while retaining 9% of receipts as an administrative fee.15 The property \ntax is not used at its full potential\u2014the valuation of properties is deficient and the statutory rates \nare very low (0.1%\u20130.2%). Collection efficiency is also very low, with less than half of the tax \nliabilities estimated to be finally collected. One option for devolving the property tax would be to \n                                                 \n14 Most regional revenues are raised by provincial governments, especially from motor vehicle registration, title \ntransfer and registration, and interest income. Key revenue sources for local governments are taxes on electricity \nand on hotels and restaurants, and fees from health clinics, building permits, and public markets.  \n15 In 2005 property revenue was Rp16 trillion, amply exceeding PAD revenues. However, property taxes on mining \n(mainly oil and gas) were 75% of revenues, urban areas 20%, and rural areas only 3.4%. \n ", "13 \ngive the regional governments discretion to set rates between a minimum and a maximum set \nby the DPR. The administration of the tax could stay centralized at first, although the collection \nfee  of  9%  should  be  reviewed.  Over  time,  it  may  be  possible  to  further  decentralize \nadministration  in  stages,  with  better-managed  governments  taking  on  more  responsibilities \nearlier  than  those  with  less  management  capacity.  In  the  recent  past,  opposition  to  the \ndecentralization of the property tax within the MOF has been interpreted largely as defending \nturf. Decentralizing the property tax would provide the regional governments with a very visible \nand considerable source of financing in the future, enhancing accountability and future budget \nneeds. The weighty issue of property tax devolution is now being closely reviewed by the \nGovernment and the DPR and in a major breakthrough is now part of the current round of \nproposed amendments to law 34/2000 that are being addressed by the DPR. \n \n31.  Unconditional Equalization Grant (DAU). This continues to be at the center of the \ndecentralization system in Indonesia and represents by far the main form of transfer from the \ncentral Government to the regional governments. The subject of constant reform since its \nintroduction  in  2001,  the  DAU  has  progressively  risen  to  26%  of  net  central  government \nrevenues from 2004, employing the formula of fiscal gap (the difference between expenditure \nneeds and fiscal capacity) plus basic allocation. The present computation of fiscal capacity fully \nincludes  all  shared  revenues,  including  those  from  natural  resources,  in  addition  to  own \nrevenues of regional governments. In computing the index of expenditure needs the Human \nDevelopment Index is now used instead of the poverty gap indicator of the past, and gross \nregional domestic product per capita has been added as another factor to the formula. The \nformula  for  computing  the  fiscal  gap  needs  continuous fine-tuning. The  estimation  of  own \nrevenues  in  the  computation  of  fiscal  capacity  could  be  further  refined  to  further  reflect \ndisparities in tax bases; however, this refinement may not be immediately feasible, given the \nlack of data. The method of computing expenditure needs is now based on a weighted index of \nseveral indicators. This index is at best an approximation of expenditure needs, since not all \ndrivers of need are included in the computation and those that are do not necessarily capture \nwell what drives needs. A more desirable way to compute expenditure needs would be based \non the direct application of minimum service standards (MSS) for service delivery, provided that \nthe regional budgets can accommodate these norms. However, broadly applied MSS are still a \nlong way from being finalized. \n \n32.  Until 2008, the actual distribution of DAU transfers was subject to a \u201chold harmless\u201d \nprovision, by which no regional government could receive less in transfers than what it received \nthe previous year. This provision effectively worked against the equalizing effects of the DAU, \nsince even regional governments for which the estimate of fiscal capacity exceeded expenditure \nneeds continued to receive transfers. In 2008, in a highly important move the Government \neffectively  eliminated  the  provision,  thus  significantly  improving  horizontal  equity  between \nregional  governments  (although  adversely  affected  regional  governments  receive  limited \ncompensatory funding through other non-DAU parts of the budget).  \n \n33.  The funding of the significant wage bills of all regional governments through the basic \nallocation of the DAU has also introduced serious perverse incentives to employ more staff \ndespite broad concerns about the excessive administrative costs of regional governments. \nStaffing efficiency varies widely between regions. In 2006, among the local governments, the \nextremes were 0.44 staff for every 1,000 people in Kabupaten Serdang Berdagi and 111.7 for \nevery  1,000  in  Kabupaten  Halmahera  Tengah.  The  current  arrangements  create  powerful \nincentives for regional governments to lobby for more staff and send the wrong signal to these \nregional governments about how to operate in the future. Since any reductions in the wage bill \nwill  simply  mean  a  reduction  in  the  level  of  DAU  transfers  with  a  year\u2019s  lag,  regional \n ", "14 \ngovernments are discouraged from streamlining their civil service. There is considerable room \nfor increasing the efficiency of regional governments and reversing the negative message sent \nby the current arrangements with the \u201cbasic allocation.\u201d A number of reform options are now \nbeing closely considered. One option would be to repeal completely the wage bill reforms of \n2006. Another option would be to fund the wage bill of the regional governments according to a \nparticular formula for structuring relative to size and to allow the governments to use the funds \nat their own discretion. The regional governments that wanted to streamline their employment \nrolls could then freely do so without penalty. Other options are being considered with further \nconcrete reform proposed for subprogram 2. \n  \n34.  Specific  Allocation  Fund  (DAK)  and  Deconcentration  Funds.  The  policy \ndevelopment of the specific allocation fund (DAK) and the reform of the deconcentrated funds \nused by central government ministries and other central government agencies for spending \nprograms  in  the  regions  are  strongly  linked.  Law  33/2004  provides  for  the  channeling  of \nnon-legitimate  deconcentration  funds  to  increase  the  DAK.16 However,  the  line  ministries \ntypically seek to delay the shift and are shielded in part by the legal ambiguities in the system \ndue to the contradictions between the sectoral laws and the decentralization laws. Government \nregulation 38/2007, which is intended to clarify expenditure assignments and help the central \nGovernment set the ceiling for and screen the budgets of ministries, widens the scope for \nidentifying and reallocating non-legitimate deconcentration funds. Another approach to switching \nfunds to DAK would be to switch deconcentration funds to the DAU and to let those funds be \nused  by  the  regional  governments  for  functions  now  administered  by  line  ministries.  The \napproach chosen\u2014whether to reinforce the DAK or the DAU\u2014will depend on the degree of \nconfidence in the appropriate functioning of a reformed DAK.  \n \n35.  The DAK has increased in absolute and relative importance, from Rp1.1 trillion in 2001 \n(0.08% of GDP) to Rp21.2 trillion in 2008 (0.47% of GDP). However, these funds still represent \na small share of total regional government revenues (about 5% of total revenues for local \ngovernments  in  2006  with  negligible  recent  provincial  DAK  funding).  There  is  scope  for \nrestructuring and refocusing the DAK on the basis of clear principles and objectives. The DAK \nshould not be burdened with the objective of equalization if that is effectively provided by the \nDAU. Ideally a reformed DAK should be defined in the context of the emerging medium-term \nexpenditure framework (MTEF). New arrangements should specify (i) matching requirements for \nregional governments; (ii) conditions for structuring programs as general block grants versus \nspecific grants; (iii) the form of allocation and distribution of the grants, including formulas and \ncompetition  through  open  bidding;  and  (iv)  the  role,  if any,  of  provincial  authorities in  the \nallocation of resources and the monitoring of results. Careful thought should also be given to \nensuring  the  \u201cadditionality\u201d  of  DAK  transfers,  in  particular  making  sure  that  they  do  not \ndiscourage  or  crowd  out  credit  operations  by  regional  governments  to  finance  long-term \ninfrastructure needs.  \n \n36.  Regional Government Borrowing, PDAMs, and Regional Surplus Reserves. The \ndecentralization system in Indonesia is faced with what seems to be a significant paradox. New \nborrowing by regional governments is negligible at present, while basic infrastructure needs at \nthe  local  level  are  huge,  as  evidenced,  for  example,  by  the  fact  that  most  public  utilities \n(PDAMs, etc.) for basic services such as water are bankrupt and operate with broken facilities. \n                                                 \n16 Legitimate  deconcentration  covers  areas  in  which  the  central  Government,  according  to  law  32/2004  and \ngovernment  regulation  38/2007,  has  a  legitimate  role  in  providing  decentralized  service  through  regional \ngovernments (either directly or shared). Illegitimate deconcentration relates to areas of regional activity where the \nlaw and government regulations do not allow the central Government to provide services but where the central \nagencies are still operating. \n ", "15 \nOn top of that, regional governments are holding on to very large cash reserves amounting to \n3% of GDP, although the extent of the reserves varies widely between regions. Each of these \nissues (lack of borrowing, dysfunctional PDAMs, and very large reserves) could be addressed \nseparately, but considering them together would facilitate effective policy making. With regard to \ncash reserves beyond loan repayment and infrastructure financing needs, regions rich in natural \nresources and with large reserves could be encouraged to create trust or inheritance funds so \nthat future generations might also benefit from the exploitation of natural resources in those \nregions.  Putting  away  part  of  the  funds  for  future  use  should  also  help  avoid  wasteful \noverspending in the present. \n \n37.  Much of the regulatory attention on borrowing has dwelt on regulating the demand side \nof local credit markets, including the passing of MOF regulation 147/2006 on the issuance of \nregional bonds. The regional credit markets have failed to develop in part because of the poor \nrepayment performance of many local governments. The new regulatory framework introduces \nnew rules for onlending, but the processes remain long and restrictive. The unclear assignment \nof expenditure responsibilities, especially those having to do with obligations for the construction \nand maintenance of infrastructure, has induced regional governments to wait for funds from the \ncentral Government to pay for the needed infrastructure. Direct central government spending in \nthe regions keeps going to functional areas that are the responsibility of regional governments \nbut for which they are less inclined to spend.  \n \n38.  In addition, public utility regulations stifle the demand for credit. For example, regional \ngovernments cannot pledge their revenues or assets except in the case of revenue bonds, and \nthey cannot guarantee PDAM loans. On the other hand, poor maintenance and cost recovery \npractices have made many PDAMs technically insolvent. Further policy development is needed \nto encourage PDAMs to function better (raise tariffs to allow cost recovery, lower operation \ncosts, and maintain the capital investment) and for regional governments in general to become \nmore responsible in maintaining infrastructure. Improved capital budgeting and implementation \nby the regional governments would also help. Much better debt and financial arrangements for \nthe vast majority of PDAMs that are struggling would significantly improve service delivery in the \nwater sector with resulting benefits for community health. The passage of the new MOF decree \n120/2008,  which  provides  for  more  generous  debt  rescheduling  and  relief  to  encourage \nspeedier restructuring, enhances the prospects. \n \n39.  Capacity  Building  for  Public  Financial  Management.  As  much  of  the  regulatory \nframework for fiscal decentralization is close to being finalized, attention is now increasingly \nbeing directed at ways to raise systems and human capacity. BAPPENAS is taking the lead in \ntrying to improve planning methods and skills at all levels of government and to link plans and \npolicies more closely to budgets in a medium-term framework. Both MOF and MOHA are \nhelping  to  disseminate  the  budgeting,  reporting,  and  supervision  requirements  of  the  new \nregulatory regime, particularly in relation to government regulations 58/2005 and 39/2007 and \nMOHA  regulations  13/2006  and  59/2007,  which  provide  the  framework  for  modern  and \nconsistent  decentralized  budget  and  financial  management.  In  2007,  MOHA  conducted \nspecialized PFM courses for about 100 officials of the central Government and 400 from the \nregional governments. MOF is also training decentralized financial officials nationwide, mainly \nthrough the regional universities. In 2007 it conducted training in eight different locations for \n1,528 regional officials. A considerable expansion of the scope of training and professional \ndevelopment of regional finance officials is planned under subprogram 2 with significantly higher \nfunding commitments from both MOHA and MOF than in recent times.  \n \n ", "16 \n40.  MOF and MOHA, with funding from the LGFGR 1 project loan, are also involved in \ndeveloping  new  computerized  financial  management  information  system  (FMIS)  to  support \nplanning, budgeting, budget execution, reporting, and auditing in 171 regional governments to \nbegin  with,  and  possibly  other  regional  governments  later  on.  About  9,642  finance  and \nmanagement officials from regional governments will be trained in this major capacity-building \nproject. Moreover, the ADB-funded Sustainable Capacity Building for Decentralization (SCBD) \nproject  continues  to  provide  about  40  participating  regional  governments  with  general \nmanagement training and support. Because these two ADB project loans are still disbursing, the \nGovernment has decided not to pursue a further project loan under subprogram 1 of LGFGR 2. \nBut the possibility of such a loan under subprogram 2 has not been ruled out, especially if the \ncurrent project support continues to make good progress. Other development partners with \ninvolvement in fiscal decentralization matters are directing most of their efforts at capacity \nbuilding in one form or another (systems, human resources, etc.) in the regional governments, \nin some cases (with ADB support) through the leadership of MOF, MOHA, and BPK (see \nAppendix  4).  Improving  capacity  for  decentralized  planning,  budgeting,  and  financial \nmanagement remains a core focus of subprograms 1 and 2 and will require the application of \nconsiderable  resources  from  all  levels  of  government  and  development  partners  over  an \nextended period of time. Under Indonesia\u2019s capacity-building framework, central ministries and \nagencies must provide leadership and facilitation but the regional governments themselves \nmust  take  ultimate  responsibility  for  improving  their  own  capacity.  There  is  still  scope  for \ndevelopment partners to support both centrally led efforts but also increasingly to engage \ndirectly with individual regional governments or groups of governments. \n \n41.  Development Partner Coordination. Many development partners are actively involved \nin fiscal aspects of decentralization in Indonesia. Apart from ADB, which plays a lead role in the \nsector,  others  actively  involved  are  the  following:  the  World  Bank,  the  Department  of \nInternational Development (DFID) of the United Kingdom, the German Agency for Technical \nCooperation  (GTZ),  the  Australian  Agency  for  International  Development,  the  Canadian \nInternational Development Agency, the United States Agency for International Development, the \nUnited Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the Japan International Cooperation Agency, \nthe  Government  of  the  Netherlands,  and  the  European  Commission.  ADB  is  collaborating \nclosely with other development partners in all six core output areas of LGFGR 2, especially \nthose  that  most  heavily  involve  sector-wide  planning  and  policy  formulation.  The \nDecentralization Support Facility (DSF), established in 2005 as a decentralization umbrella \norganization,  strives  to  harmonize  the  Government\u2019s  needs  and  development  partners\u2019 \ninterventions. The founding members of DSF are ADB, DFID, the Netherlands, UNDP, and the \nWorld Bank. DSF is funded mainly by DFID and is managed by the World Bank under a trust \nfund  arrangement.  A  more  formal  sector-wide  type  approach  to  decentralization  support \ninvolving  all  development  partners  and  government  stakeholders  has  been  the  subject  of \nongoing  discussions,  but  approaches  have  not  yet  been  fully  harmonized.  As  the \nADB-supported LGFGR moves from program 1 to program 2, many development partners are \ninterested in exploring the possibility of harmonization under the broad heading of the NAPFD \nand the LGFGR 2 policy matrix. Such an approach is still far from being achieved under \nsubprogram 1 of LGFGR 2, but remains a useful medium-term objective and will be pursued \nmore actively in subprogram 2, including in relation to the proposed revision of the NAPFD to \nextend the planning framework to 2010\u20132014. \nC.  Lessons  \n42.  Lessons drawn from LGFGR 1 and NAPFD implementation are the most important. In \naddition, a number of diagnostic assessments and experience gained in implementing ADB\u2019s \n ", "17 \nSCBD loan were also considered in designing LGFGR 2, as were two recent evaluation studies \nthat looked into decentralization and capacity-building issues in Indonesia.17 The important \nlessons learned are: \n \n(i)  Long-term commitment. Indonesia is still in the early phases of very major \nfiscal  decentralization  reform.  The  Government  remains  very  serious  about \ndeepening  reforms  and  raising  capacity.  ADB\u2019s  medium-  to  longer-term \ncommitment after LGFGR 1 remains appropriate. \n(ii)  Government leadership of the program. A very collaborative and interactive \napproach to issue analysis and program preparation, driven by the Government, \nhas been taken under LGFGR 2. \n(iii)  Intensive, not spasmodic, engagement over time. Intensive longer-term ADB \nengagement is necessary for the effective formulation and monitoring of the \nreform agenda. The rushed processing of LGFGR 1 lessened program credibility \nat the start.  ADB must be involved more intensively throughout LGFGR 2. \n(iv)  Coordination with government. Decentralization involves complex crosscutting \nissues  with  a  multitude  of  stakeholders,  requiring  close  coordination  and \nconsensus building among central government agencies and between central the \nGovernment and the regional governments. LGFGR 2 addresses the need to \nimprove capacity and coordination among relevant central government agencies \nand seeks to clarify the roles of various levels of government. \n(v)  Donor coordination. Large, complex strategic issues such as decentralization \nrequire active partnering with other development partners. Despite efforts made \nthrough DSF and development partners, engagement with development partners \nin preparing LGFGR 1 was limited. Further serious efforts to develop a single \ngovernment-led program supported by DSF are warranted over time. \n(vi)  Clarity of sector functions. The continuing mismatch between sector policies, \nlaws,  and  regulations,  on  the  one  hand,  and  the  general  decentralization \nframework,  on  the  other,  needs  to  be  addressed.  LGFGR  2  supports  the \nidentification of inconsistencies and is aimed at addressing them in two pilot \nsectors with follow-ups planned. \n(vii)  Horizontal and vertical fiscal decentralization. There must be a better balance \nbetween the revenue and expenditure responsibilities of regional governments, \nand  issues  of  fiscal  equalization  between  richer  and  poor  regions  must  be \naddressed.  LGFGR  2  is  designed  to  support  vertical  and  horizontal \nimprovements in intergovernmental financing.  \n(viii)  Capacity  building.  Decentralization  efforts  must  be  complemented  with \nappropriate reforms in organizations and systems, as well as human capacity \nbuilding,  to  allow  the regions  to manage  their  personnel  and  finances  more \nefficiently and effectively. LGFGR 2 is aimed at supporting systemic capacity \ndevelopment in budgeting, financial management, service delivery, and human \nresources improvement.  \n                                                 \n17 ADB. 2005.

PROPOSED PROGRAM CLUSTER \nA.  Links to LGFGR 1 and Other ADB Assistance  \n43.  The details and lessons from LGFGR 1 were fully considered in the development of \nLGFGR 2;18 the two programs are integrally linked. In LGFGR 1, the desired outcome was \n\u201cincreased accountability in the management of regional finances\u201d. In LGFGR 2 the outcome \nhas been somewhat broadened to \u201chaving improved organizational capacities and operating in \na  more  transparent,  effective  and  efficient  policy  and  legal  environment  for  fiscal \ndecentralization,  financial  management  and  service  delivery\u201d.  In  LGFGR  1,  the  desired \nlonger-term impact was \u201cmore effective and efficient delivery of basic public services by regional \ngovernments\u201d. The longer-term impact sought under LGFGR 2 is broadly similar: \u201cimproved \nefficiency, effectiveness and interregional equity of regional government spending\u201d. \n \n44.  LGFGR 1 had five core output areas, namely: (i) coordination and planning; (ii) regional \nadministration; (iii) intergovernmental finance; (iv) planning, budgeting, and PFM; and (v) FMIS \ndevelopment and project loan planning. LGFGR 2 closely follows these core output areas, \nalthough minor reclassification has increased their number to six. Output areas 1 (coordination \nand  planning)  and  2  (regional  administration)  are  the  same  in  both  programs.  But  while \nintergovernmental financing, regional government revenue policy, and debt management were \nall contained in output area 3 in LGFGR 1, in LGFGR 2 these are now split into areas 3, 4, and \n5. And planning, budgeting and financial management, and FMIS development, which were in \nareas 4 and 5 in LGFGR 1, are all in output area 6 in LGFGR 2.  \n \n45.  The LGFGR 1 period covered 2003\u20132005, in a medium-term approach to program \ndevelopment, with further program loans expected to follow the first single-tranche release of \n$300 million in December 2005. The report and recommendation of the President for LGFGR 1 \nprovided for 14 indicative actions that were likely to be pursued in a second phase. These 14 \nindicative actions are set out in Supplementary Appendix A, Table SAA.1. As the table shows, \n13 of the 14 indicative actions have been squarely provided for in the LGFGR 2 policy matrix. \nThe only exclusion relates to the then anticipated development of a regulatory regime for \nregional government bankruptcies, which was not of sufficiently high priority to the Government \nto be included in LGFGR 2. With 20 core triggers, the policy actions under LGFGR 2 go deeper \nthan the levels envisaged at the time LGFGR 1 was prepared. \n \n46.  The chart in Appendix 5 and Table SAA.2 in Supplementary Appendix A map in a more \ndetailed way the links between actions under LGFGR 1 and LGFGR 2 (subprograms 1 and 2). \nThe  mapping  indicates  that  the  reform  efforts  undergo  no  significant  broadening  between \nLGFGR 1 and LGFGR 2 (essentially the same core output groupings are addressed in both) but \nsignificantly deepen in LGFGR 2. The most important component that binds the two programs is \nthe Government\u2019s NAPFD, which is central to the selection of well-sequenced actions under \nboth programs. While proposed actions under subprograms 1 and 2 of LGFGR 2 heighten the \nLGFGR 1 reform efforts in several ways, the deepening generally comes from the following:  \n \n(i)  LGFGR  1  finalized  higher-level  laws  and  regulations  and  began  work  on \ninstitutional strengthening and capacity building, particularly with support from the \nproject loan; \n                                                 \n18 A fuller treatment of the links between LGFGR 1 and LGFGR 2 appears in Appendix 5 and Supplementary \nAppendix A. \n ", "19 \n(ii)  LGFGR 2 (subprogram 1) is moving much closer to finalizing the regulatory \nregime  while  intensifying  work  on  critical  policy  reforms  and  on  institutional \nstrengthening and capacity building; and \n(iii)  LGFGR 2 (subprogram 2) will move to a near-settled regulatory regime with the \nimplementation of identified policy reforms, while further deepening efforts to \nstrengthen institutions and build capacity. \n \n47.  In conjunction with the LGFGR 1 program and project loans, ADB since 2003 has \nprovided  intensive  interaction  on  decentralization  issues  through  three  loans  and  five  TA \nprojects  that  have  supported  capacity  development,  local  financing,  public  financial \nmanagement,  service  delivery,  performance  measurement,  and  reporting  and  information \nsystems.19 ADB has contributed significantly to the achievement of LGFGR 2 subprogram 1 \ncore policy actions through concerted efforts with both the central Government and regional \ngovernments. This work has included strong interaction in both the policy and the investment \naspects  of  fiscal  decentralization.  The  SCBD  project  loan  provides  ongoing  support  to  40 \nregional governments in management capacity building. At the same time, the LGFGR 1 project \nloan  is  supporting  the  implementation  of  computerized  financial  management  information \nsystems and related financial management capacity building in 171 regional governments. \nCapacity-building initiatives were designed and the regional government tax law was finalized \nunder  TA  4282,  the  NAPFD  was  developed  and  the  legal  and  institutional  framework \nstrengthened under TA 4543, and the DPOD received support in institutional strengthening and \ncapacity building under TA 4682. At present, a regional government performance measurement \nsystem  is  being  designed  and  implemented  under  TA  9082,  while  TA  7010  is  supporting \nmedium-term  sector  planning,  NAPFD  updating,  road  map  preparation  for  local  revenue \nenhancement,  a  study  on  the  devolution  of  property  tax,  the  drafting  of  a  policy  on  the \nproliferation of regional governments, the clarification of expenditure assignments, and the \nidentification of savings from inappropriate deconcentrated expenditures.  \n \n48.  The  LGFGR  2  program  cluster  has  various  links  with  the  Poverty  Reduction  and \nMillennium Development Goals Acceleration Program,20 among them, (i) reforms in the system \nof DAK conditional grants to improve targeting in education and health, and (ii) the development \nof improved regional government budgeting and more effective service delivery (including the \nuse of MSS) in the education and health sectors. LGFGR 2 is also closely linked with the DPSP \ntargeting broader policy reform in the core areas of (i) macroeconomic stability, (ii) investment \nclimate, (iii) public financial management, and (iv) service delivery. \n                                                 \n19 ADB. 2003.

Fiscal decentralization in Indonesia is faced with many issues and challenges, and \nrequires a focused and comprehensive medium- to long-term program response. The LGFGR 2 \nprogram has six core output areas, as set out below. The program is expected to improve the \norganizational capacity of the regional governments and enable them to operate in a more \ntransparent,  effective,  and  efficient  policy  and  legal  environment  for  fiscal  decentralization, \nfinancial management, and service delivery. Over the longer term, the program is expected to \nimprove the efficiency, effectiveness, and interregional equity of regional government spending.  \nC.  Policy Framework and Actions \n50.  Program  Cluster  Modality.  The  program  comprises  two  subprograms  structured \nsequentially as follows: (i) two single-tranche operations (subprogram 1 from January 2006 to \nDecember 2008, and subprogram 2 from January 2009 to December 2011) with a well-defined \nmedium-term  framework  specified  at  the  outset,  including  reforms  to  be  completed  by \nNovember 2008 under subprogram 1; and (ii) triggers for subprogram 2, to ensure continuous \ndialogue with the Government. Subprogram 2 will be further formulated during the LGFGR \nprogram review to allow adjustments in the program based on progress made and changes in \nthe external environment. Such formulation does not obligate ADB to additional lending for \nsubprogram 2, which will be subject to Board approval. Specifically, the LGFGR 2 program \nprovides for reform and strengthening in the following six core output areas: \n \n(i)  Decentralization  framework  and  program  management\u2014strengthened \nmanagement and coordination of fiscal decentralization matters; \n(ii)  Regional autonomy and local governance\u2014clearer arrangements for regional \nadministration to improve services and accountability; \n(iii)  Intergovernmental  fiscal  system\u2014enhanced equalization, predictability, and \ntransparency in the release of fiscal transfers and shared revenues; \n(iv)  Own-resource revenues\u2014more buoyant sources of local revenues to reduce \ndependency on fiscal transfers; \n(v)  Regional reserves and debts\u2014bolstering the management of regional reserves \nand debts; and \n(vi)  Human and systems capacity development, public financial management \nand accountability. \n1.  Decentralization Framework and Program Management \n51.  Links  to  LGFGR  1.  This  output area  will  ensure  a  strong  legal  and  management \nframework  for  coordinating  and  implementing  LGFGR  2,  and  the  orderly  and  effective \ncontinuation of the decentralization agenda over the medium to long term. In LGFGR, 1 DPOD \nwas newly established under law 32/2004 and related presidential and MOHA regulations. The \nNAPFD, which was completed in 2005, was the core guide in LGFGR 2 preparation and links \nLGFGR 1 and 2.  \n \n52.  LGFGR 2 Subprogram 1 Triggers. There are two triggers: (i) the completion of the \nupdated  NAPFD,  with  options  for  revisions  in  policy  actions  to  provide  a  medium-term \nframework for fiscal decentralization reform; and (ii) the establishment of the new Directorate \nGeneral of Fiscal Balance in MOF to lead the development of the fiscal and governance aspects \n ", "21 \nof  decentralization.21 MOF  is  preparing  a  longer-term  strategy  document  (the  draft  grand \nstrategy for fiscal decentralization) to guide medium-term actions under NAPFD and successive \nLGFGR programs. In the broader coordination of all aspects of decentralization, the DPOD, as \nthe advisory body to the president, has an important role. In subprogram 1, the DPOD initiatives \ninclude a capacity development report and a draft 2-year training plan for the secretariat staff \ncovering administrative, management, and policy coordination training.  \n    \n53.  LGFGR 2 Subprogram 2 Triggers and Milestones. Two triggers are proposed for \nsubprogram 2: first, the grand strategy document will be finalized and will guide the setting of \nlong-term directions for fiscal decentralization; and second, the leadership role of the Directorate \nGeneral of Fiscal Balance will be heightened through regular consultations with all stakeholders, \nenhanced  flows  of  fiscal  decentralization  information,  and  annual  progress  reporting.  An \nupdated version of NAPFD (up to 2010\u20132014) will be prepared, policy options for strengthening \nDPOD  will  be  further  reviewed,  and  the  DPOD  secretariat  staff  will  undergo  capacity \ndevelopment and training. The DPOD board, technical team, and working groups will meet \nregularly.  \n \n2.  Regional Autonomy and Local Governance \n \n54.  Links  to  LGFGR  1. Reforms and strengthening in administrative areas of regional \nautonomy will be undertaken in this output area to improve service delivery and accountability. \nDuring the LGFGR 1 period, law 32/2004 on regional administration and government regulation \n65/2005 on MSS were passed, providing the broad framework for regional autonomy and local \ngovernance. \n \n55.  LGFGR 2 Subprogram 1 Triggers. The subprogram supports the Government\u2019s efforts \nto improve the policy and legal framework, in answer to the problem of proliferating regional \ngovernments.  The  improvements  will  be  achieved  through  a  new  government  regulation \n(78/2007) that addresses the establishment, breakup, and merger of regional governments. The \ntrigger is passing of government regulation 6/2008, which covers the evaluation of regional \ngovernment performance, in relation to the establishment and merger of governments and other \nmatters. Preparations for a draft grand strategy paper on territorial subdivision have begun in \nthe DPR, and are likely to lead to further policy and regulatory reform to better manage the \nestablishment, breakup, and merger of regional governments. \n \n56.  Subprogram 1 also supports efforts to clarify the intermediate role of provinces and their \ngovernors through a government regulation in this area as part of a broader review of law \n32/2004 on regional administration. The reform of decentralized civil service arrangements has \nanother trigger: a new government regulation (41/2007) providing principles and guidelines on \nregional  organizational  structures  and  facilitating  the  reform  of  decentralized  civil  service \narrangements. MOF has reviewed the possibility of delinking the basic/staffing allocation from \nthe  DAU  to  support  more  flexible  regional  organizational  and  staffing  arrangements. \nSubprogram 1 further supports reforms to clarify expenditure assignments across levels of \ngovernment,  with  two  triggers:  (i)  the  passage  of  a  very  detailed  government  regulation \n(38/2007) on the assignment of expenditures to different levels of government; and (ii) the start \nof practical work to identify inconsistencies between the new regulation and sector policies and \nlaws,  including  a  detailed  review  of  inconsistencies  in  the  ministries  of  environment,  and \n                                                 \n21 The Directorate General of Fiscal Balance is responsible for all policy and administrative aspects of financial \narrangements between the central Government and regional governments broadly covering the following: (i) fiscal \nbalance including transfers and revenue sharing, (ii) regional taxes and levies, (iii) loans and grants and regional \ncapacity building, and (iv) consolidation of financial information and evaluation of financial performance. \n ", "22 \ncommunications and information. Draft legal amendments and policy statements are being \nprepared to rectify the inconsistencies.  \n \n57.  LGFGR 2 Subprogram 2 Triggers and Milestones. There are two triggers: (i) the \nprocessing of applications for the establishment of new regions according to the methodology \nspecified  in  the  new  policy  and  legal  framework,  with  less  emphasis  on  purely  political \nconsiderations; and (ii) the finalization of the framework for addressing inconsistencies in laws, \nand the start of implementation. DPR commission members will be trained in the new legal \nframework. The legal and regulatory clarifications on the intermediate role of provinces and \ngovernors will also be finalized. Furthermore, the basic (staffing) allocation will be delinked from \nthe DAU and incentives linked to transfers will be pilot-tested, to stimulate the switching of \nregional expenditures from administrative staffing to higher-priority outlays. Finally, the work on \nremoving inconsistencies between sector and decentralization laws will intensify and at least \n85% of the ministries will review and prepare draft amendments to sector policies, laws, and \nregulations that are consistent with government regulation 38/2007. \n \n3.  Intergovernmental Fiscal System \n \n58.  Links to LGFGR 1. This output area supports the Government\u2019s reforms to enhance \nequalization,  predictability,  and  transparency  in  the  release  of  fiscal  transfers  and  shared \nrevenues.  During  the  LGFGR  1  period,  law  33/2004  on  fiscal  balance  and  the  related \ngovernment regulation 55/2005 were passed, providing the framework for fiscal transfers and \nshared revenues. Government regulation 56/2005, providing guidelines on regional financial \nmanagement information systems, was also passed. \n \n59.  LGFGR 2 Subprogram 1. Under this subprogram, the DAU continues as the principal \nform of central funds transfers and is based on the gap between \u201cfiscal capacities\u201d and \u201cfiscal \nneeds.\u201d The first of the four triggers is the review of options for possible delinking of the basic \n(staffing) allocation from the DAU to support more flexible regional staffing and organizational \narrangements and to significantly enhance the equalization effects of the DAU. The second \ntrigger is the removal in 2008 of the \u201chold harmless\u201d clause, which favored better-off regions, \nsignificantly enhancing the equalization effects of the DAU. The Directorate General of Fiscal \nBalance in MOF has regularly reviewed the DAU formula including the following aspects: (i) \ndisparities in tax bases, (ii) the continued inclusion of all revenue sources, and (iii) the need to \nimprove indicators of expenditure needs. The latest formulas and weights used in computing \nfiscal capacities and needs are now being published as part of budget documents.  \n \n60.  Over time, provisions will be made for the preparation of forward estimates of major \ntransfers as part of a broader move by the central Government to an MTEF planning and \nbudgeting system. MOF is preparing a preliminary design approach for such estimates. Under \nsubprogram 1, the Government has sought to reduce central government expenditures on \nactivities that have been legally assigned to the regional governments to make room for higher \npriorities. Government regulation 7/2008, which provides guidelines for managing the legitimate \ndeconcentration expenditures of the central Government, has been passed. This, along with the \nnew government regulation 38/2007, provides a basis for identifying and gradually removing \nnon-legitimate central government expenditures. This forms the third trigger by which non-\nlegitimate central expenditures for the health, education, and infrastructure ministries have been \nreduced by about Rp4.2 trillion, with DAK increasing by 24% in the 2008 budget. The fourth \ntrigger is a detailed data analysis by BAPPENAS, MOF, and MOHA in two pilot ministries \n(education and environment) to identify further non-legitimate expenditures for removal in the \n2010 budget. Furthermore, the Government will increase funding and improve the design of \n ", "23 \nDAK to enhance the impact of these expenditures. A joint ministerial letter (MOF, MOHA, \nBAPPENAS) providing for strengthened DAK monitoring and evaluation arrangements has been \nprepared. Work has also started on a new MOF regulation or an update of MOF guidelines on \nthe DAK. \n \n61.  Work under subprogram 1 to test performance- and sanction-based elements of central \ntransfers has begun. A policy paper is being prepared by MOF on the possibility of increasing \nthe use of incentives and sanctions to stimulate better results in areas such as the timely \npreparation  of  budgets  and  financial  and  performance  reports,  and  the  reduction  of \nadministrative outlays. Finally, regional governments have taken a keen interest in ensuring that \nreleases of shared revenues are smooth and predictable. MOF has made the release system \nmore efficient; smoother flows of funds releases are now based on government regulations \n142/2006 (natural resource revenues) and 217/2007 (oil revenues in Aceh province). \n \n62.  LGFGR 2 Subprogram 2 Triggers and Milestones. The first of the three triggers will \nbe the formulation of a legal basis for delinking wage payments from the DAU to allow flexible \nmanagement of regional staffing levels without limiting access to the DAU, thus significantly \nimproving the equalization effects. The DAU formula will be further refined. The Directorate \nGeneral of Fiscal Balance in MOF will regularly review and refine the formula (see para. 59). \nThe latest formulas and weights used in computing fiscal capacities and needs will be published \nin annual budget documents. The preparation and publication of forward estimates for all major \ntransfers  and  shared  revenues  will  be  the  second  trigger.  The  final  trigger  will  be  the \nidentification and realization of significant further savings of up to 50% in non-legitimate central \nministry expenditures in two pilot ministries. The implementation of the new DAK guidelines will \nconsiderably improve the targeting and impact of DAK expenditures. Finally, the new packages \nof incentives and sanctions for central transfers will be pilot-tested. Full implementation of all \nthese  intergovernmental  financing  reforms  during  subprogram  2  will  be  highly  significant \nachievements. \n \n4.  Own-Source Revenues \n \n63.  Links  to  LGFGR  1.  The  activities  in  this  output  area  will  be  aimed  at  reducing \ndependency on fiscal transfers by developing more buoyant sources of local revenues. In \nLGFGR 1, draft amendments to law 34/2000 (regional tax law) were prepared. Inconsistent \nregional government tax laws were also revoked by the central Government.  \n \n64.  LGFGR 2 Subprogram 1 Triggers. The subprogram has two triggers. The first trigger, \nin support of the Government\u2019s efforts to amend law 34/2000 on regional taxes and levies, will \ninvolve a shift to a closed-list approach to regional taxes, to reduce the number of nuisance \ntaxes and at the same time provide more autonomy to the regions in imposing taxes according \nto the closed list. In a breakthrough move, the DPR is considering devolving further taxing \npowers, including the property tax and stamp duty\u2013type taxes on the sale of land and property. \nThe DPR is expected to pass the amendments to law 34/2000 in 2008. Moreover, MOF is \ndesigning and implementing a computerized system for  the submission and processing of \nregional tax laws that will markedly reduce processing time and enable the Government to weed \nout inappropriate and illegal regional taxes. MOF is also preparing a road map for tax policy \nreform, which will become part of the draft grand strategy for fiscal decentralization. The second \ntrigger is the preparatory work to develop options for gradually devolving the property tax to the \nregions, with a study being undertaken to develop proposals and draft legal amendments to \nprovide for the gradual decentralization of the property tax.  \n \n ", "24 \n65.  LGFGR 2 Subprogram 2 Triggers and Milestones. The amendments to law 34/2000 \nwill be disseminated and the tax regime will be further reviewed. The automated system for \nvetting regional taxes will be fully implemented in MOF. The decentralized tax reform road map \nwill be closely aligned with the medium-term NAPFD and the longer-term grand strategy, and \nwill be complemented by an annual report from the Regional Revenue Directorate of MOF, \ncharting progress in the implementation of the road map. The single and very critical trigger \nunder subprogram 2 will be the implementation of an agreed approach to devolving the property \ntax, including the review of valued assessments. \n5.  Regional Reserves and Debts \n66.  Links to LGFGR 1. This output area is aimed at strengthening the management of \nregional reserves and debts. In LGFGR 1, the legal framework for debt management was \nsignificantly  enhanced,  with  the  passage  of  government  regulation  54/2005  on  regional \ngovernment borrowing, government regulation 14/2004 on the workout of regional government \ndebts, and MOF decree 129/2005 on the workout of regional government debts. Debt and \narrears workouts were also initiated in seven PDAMs.  \n \n67.  LGFGR 2 Subprogram 1. Under this subprogram, the emergence of significant financial \nreserves in a large number of regional governments has become an important fiscal policy \nissue, and MOF has developed systems for monitoring cash holdings in the banking system in \nresponse. MOF is also developing concepts for longer-term trust fund arrangements, especially \nin wealthier regions. MOF decree 45/2006, which sets out guidelines for the submission and \npublication of regional government debt data for better management of regional debt, has been \npassed. The director general of treasury of MOF has also implemented a computerized debt \nmanagement and financial accounting system (DMFAS).  \n \n68.  The difficult financial circumstances of many PDAMs have severely hampered their \nability to provide adequate water and sanitation infrastructure. Treasury regulation 53/2006 set \nout guidelines for rescheduling PDAM debts. Under subprogram 1, significant progress has \nbeen made to restructure nonperforming PDAM debts with the passage of a new MOF decree \n120/2008,  which  further  streamlines  application  procedures  with  more  generous  debt \nrescheduling and relief arrangements to speed up debt restructuring. The three triggers in this \ncomponent  are:  (i)  MOF\u2019s  entry  into  discussions  and  dissemination  with  all  175  regional \ngovernments and PDAMs with arrears, to facilitate the participation of the PDAMs in the new \nrestructuring scheme; (ii) the preparation of a draft MOF decree on technical approaches to use \npart of the revenue-sharing transfers (Dana Bagi Hasil, or DBH) and DAU transfers to the \nregional governments to meet outstanding debt service payments to the central Government; \nand  (iii)  ongoing  support  for  the  development  of  a  regional  bond  market  in  creditworthy \ngovernments in selected pilot locations. MOF has issued a decree (147/2006) specifying the \nauthorities  and  guidelines  for  issuing  regional  government  bonds;  with  dissemination  of \nguidelines and training of concerned officials.  \n \n69.  LGFGR 2 Subprogram 2 Triggers and Milestones.  The three triggers will be: (i) the \nfull operationalization of DMFAS and the improvement of information flows, which will help \nstrengthen  debt  management  and  policy  and  thus  reduce  the  arrears  that  curb  regional \ninvestment borrowing; (ii) the restructuring of at least 85% of nonperforming PDAM debts and \ntheir prompt payment; and (iii) central government support for the development of regional bond \nissues  in  at  least  five  creditworthy  regional  governments  (including  training,  due-diligence \nstudies, document preparation, private credit ratings, and a strengthened regulatory regime for \ndealing with defaults and bankruptcies). Other actions include the pilot implementation of a trust \n ", "25 \nfund mechanism in at least two provinces and four local governments, and the implementation \nof the new intercept arrangements for fund transfers. \n \n6.  Capacity Development, Public Financial Management, and Accountability \n \n70.  Links  to  LGFGR  1.  This component is aimed at developing human and systems \ncapacity and strengthening public financial management and accountability. During the LGFGR \n1 period, an extensive higher-level legal framework was put in place to underpin reforms in PFM \nand accountability. Important laws and regulations passed included the following: (i) laws on \ndevelopment planning (25/2004) and on the state treasury (1/2004); (ii) government regulations \non  work  plans  (20/2004),  on  budgeting  (21/2004),  on  government  accounting  standards \n(24/2005), and on regional financial management (58/2005); and (iii) a presidential decree on \ngovernment accounting standards (2/2005). An action plan for the implementation of the new \nlegal framework was prepared. Action plans were also drawn up for (i) the computerization of \ndata transmission for the regional financial information system (Sistem Informasi Keuangan \nDaerah,  or  SIKD),  and  (ii)  the  development  of  financial  management  information  systems \n(FMIS) for the regional governments. The Government also selected and reached agreement \nwith 171 provinces and districts for their participation in SIKD and FMIS development.  \n \n71.  LGFGR 2 Subprogram 1. The Government recognizes that developing capacity in the \nregional governments is perhaps the most important issue to be addressed under LGFGR 2 and \nthat success will involve considerable resources and effort. As the new legal and regulatory \nregime  has  come  more  fully  into  place  under  subprogram  1,  the central  Government  has \nredoubled its efforts to provide improved funding and coordination, and development partners \nhave intensified the development and rollout of resources in support of human and systems \ncapacity building in the regions. Improved coordination in capacity building is being addressed \nin part through MOHA with the preparation of a proposed presidential regulation on capacity \nbuilding, which was drafted under subprogram 1. Elevating capacity building to the presidential \nlevel makes it more likely that capacity building will be better coordinated and backed with \nadequate resources. \n \n72.  Subprogram 1 has five triggers for this component: (i) MOHA regulations 13/2006 and \n59/2007,  and  related  Bappenas  and  MOF  regulations  issued  which  guide  systems  and \napproaches to PFM in the regional governments; (ii) MOHA trained 100 central government and \n400 regional government officials, while MOF trained 1,528 regional government officials in \nPFM; (iii) MOF designed a certification system for new functional positions in government \nfinance, including those based in the regions (such as the regional treasury offices throughout \nthe country), in the form of a detailed draft regulation to be submitted to the Civil Service \nCommission  (MENPAN);  (iv)  design  and  development  of  computerized  FMIS  to  support \nimplementation of new SIKD information collection and transmission system in 171 locations for \nimproving financial reporting to the central Government; and (v) government regulation 6/2008 \nhas  been  passed  to  provide  a  comprehensive  approach  to  evaluating  the  performance  of \nregional governments. The new computer-based FMIS and SIKD being rolled out in 2008 and \n2009 will be used to train about 9,642 key users of the new systems and middle and upper-level \nmanagers.  \n \n73.  In subprogram 1, the need to improve coordination in collecting and analyzing regional \nfinancial data to reduce bureaucratic overlaps is recognized. Improved coordination (especially \nbetween MOF, MOHA, and BPS) is achieved through more effective reporting and improved \nhigher-level monitoring of reported outcomes. Computerized software is being designed to \nprovide  and  transmit  SIKD  data  to  MOF  and  MOHA  in  formats  that  are  consistent  with \n ", "26 \ngovernment  regulations  56/2005  (regional  financial  reporting),  and  13/2006  and  59/2007 \n(regional financial management). The closely related need for better coordinated approaches to \nthe  collection  and  analysis  of  (nonfinancial)  performance  information  by  various  agencies, \nincluding directorates general and directorates of MOHA, MOF, BAPPENAS, BPS, and line \nministries, is also recognized. Arrangements for improved coordination are being developed \nthrough MOHA. Continued efforts are under way under subprogram 1 to compare and publish \nbenchmarked  performance  information  between  regions.  A  MOHA  decree  is  also  being \nprepared  to  provide  more  detailed  technical  guidelines,  including  standard  performance \nindicators for service delivery monitoring. Work is under way to prepare a regional government \nperformance measurement system (RGPMS).  \n \n74.  LGFGR 2 Subprogram 2 Triggers and Milestones. There will be three triggers for \nsubprogram 2. First, the implementation of the presidential regulation on capacity building will \nbegin, while implementation of other capacity development efforts including the following, will \nintensify: (i) significant additional government funding for PFM training and capacity building \nthrough  MOHA  and  MOF  (at  least  25%  growth  yearly  over  the  2008  level);  (ii)  full \nimplementation  of  the  regional  training  plan  for  subprogram  2;  (iii)  implementation  of \ncomputerized FMIS and SIKD data transmission systems, along with training and support, and \ntheir full operationalization in 171 regional governments with free software that will significantly \nreduce  the  time  needed  to  prepare  central  consolidated  regional  government  financial \ninformation (from 3 years to 1 year); and (iv) finalization of regulations and certification of new \nfunctional  positions  for  key  finance  officials.  Second,  the  improved  coordination  developed \nunder subprogram 1 will be implemented under subprogram 2 with enhanced use of electronic \ntransmission and improved access to more timely information on regional budget and financial \nperformance, including Web-based information. Finally, the RGPMS will be functioning in at \nleast  40  pilot  locations  in  subprogram  2,  with  a  central  database  allowing  for  transparent \ncomparisons across regional governments.  \nD.  Important Features \n75.  LGFGR 2 has several distinctive features. First, it helps strengthen ADB\u2019s partnership \nwith the Government. By basing financial assistance on completed actions derived from the \nGovernment\u2019s own reform program, LGFGR 2 strengthens government ownership of reform \nstrategies, with support from development partners operating in a coordinated manner. Second, \nthe inclusion of policy triggers and milestones for subprogram 2 facilitates broad-based dialogue \non the Government\u2019s fiscal decentralization agenda in the medium term, with reforms flowing \nsequentially from LGFGR 1 to the two subprograms of LGFGR 2. Third, the LGFGR program \nhelps to establish an institutional mechanism for achieving better interagency coordination and \nimplementation of reforms across the central Government and regional governments. Finally, \nthe program cluster approach helps to lay out a comprehensive set of complex reforms in a \nwell-sequenced  fashion.  The  flexibility  provided  by  single-tranche  program  cluster  funding \nallows adjustments to be made to suit changing circumstances within the longer-term cluster \nconcept, without losing focus on achievable outcomes up front, including high-impact outcomes \nto be completed before each Board consideration of financing. \nE.  Financing Plan \n76.  The Government has requested a loan of $350 million equivalent from ADB\u2019s ordinary \ncapital resources to support policy action under subprogram 1, as outlined in the development \npolicy letter and the policy matrix. The loan will have a term of 15 years, including a grace \nperiod of 3 years, an interest rate determined according to ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate \n ", "27 \n(LIBOR)\u2013based lending facility, and a commitment charge of 0.15% yearly.22 The decision to \nborrow under this lending facility was made independently by the Government, which has given \nan undertaking that the choice was not based on advice from ADB. The Government also \nenvisages the need for a loan of $350 million to finance subprogram 2; the loan amount will be \nconfirmed at the time of loan processing in 2011. The reform agenda for subprogram 2 will be \nrefined to reflect progress and evolving circumstances. The loan for subprogram 1 will be \nreleased in one tranche after meeting the conditions of the policy matrix. \n \n77.  The  program  loan  reflects  the  Government\u2019s  development  financing  needs  in  2008 \n(Table  5).  According  to  the  latest  budget  update  of  the  Government,  the  gross  financing \n(external and domestic) requirement for 2008 is expected to lower than budgeted at Rp125.4 \ntrillion, reflecting a lower deficit of about 1.3% of GDP. In line with the Government\u2019s debt \nmanagement strategy of diversifying its liability portfolio by increasing longer-term rupiah and \ndollar bonds and maximizing overseas concessional development assistance financing, gross \nexternal borrowing is projected at Rp47.1 trillion. With the decline in borrowing requirements, \nthe country\u2019s debt-to-GDP ratio is projected to decline further in 2008. The assessment of debt \nsustainability  by  ADB  staff  indicates  that  the  Government\u2019s  debt  stock  and  strategy  are \nsustainable over the medium term. The proposed subprogram loan amount of $350 million \nequivalent will help to close the financing gap for 2008. \n \nTable 5: Projected Financing Requirements of the Government of Indonesia for 2008 \n($ million) \n \nFinancing Mix  Proposed Amount \nGross Financing Requirements  13, 518.95 \nLess Amortization             6,694.79 \nNet Financing Requirement               6,824.16 \nProgrammed Gross External Borrowings               5,077.69 \nof which:   \nADB\u2019s proposed loan pipeline                  830.00 \nDevelopment Policy Support Program                   200.00 \nInfrastructure Reform Support Development Program                 280.00 \nLocal Government Financing and Governance Reform 2 (Subprogram 1)                  350.00 \nOther donor  and commercial borrowings                4,247.69 \nADB = Asian Development Bank. \nNote: Exchange rate: $1 = Rp9,276. \nSources: Ministry of Finance and ADB estimates. \n \nF.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n1.  Program Management \n \n78.  The MOF Directorate General of Fiscal Balance will be the Executing Agency (EA) and \nwill be responsible for the overall implementation of subprograms 1 and 2 of LGFGR 2 including \ncompliance with all policy actions, program administration, disbursements, and maintenance of \nall program records. MOF has established a steering committee chaired by the MOF director \ngeneral of fiscal balance with the following as members: the MOF directors general for treasury, \nbudget, and debt management; the MOHA directors general for regional financial management, \nregional  autonomy,  and  government  affairs;  and  the  BAPPENAS  deputies  for  regional \ndevelopment and local autonomy and for development funding. Selected representatives from \nthe provincial and local governments will be invited to participate in meetings of the steering \n                                                 \n22 ADB\u2019s Board of Directors has discounted the commitment charge to 0.15%, and waived the front-end fee of 1.00% \nfor loans approved from 1 July 2007 through 30 June 2009. \n ", "28 \ncommittee, which will coordinate the implementation of LGFGR 2 policy actions with relevant \nagencies supporting the program. The committee meets at least semi annually to monitor the \nprogress and oversee the implementation of the program. ADB may be invited to participate in \nthe meetings as an observer. Below the steering committee is an implementation committee \nchaired by the secretary of the Directorate General of Fiscal Balance and comprising about 30 \nsenior  members  from  the  program  implementing  agencies,  including  all  the  relevant \nimplementing directorates of MOF, MOHA, and BAPPENAS. Selected representatives from the \nprovincial and local governments will be invited to participate in meetings of the implementation \ncommittee. \n \n2.  Implementation Period \n \n79.  The subprogram 1 implementation period is from January 2006 to December 2008. All \nactions included in the policy matrix under subprogram 1 have been implemented. By June \n2009, the Government and ADB will have prepared a subprogram 1 program completion report, \nwhich, subject to the approval of subprogram 2, will be used as part of the overall program \ncompletion report. \n \n3.  Procurement and Disbursement Arrangements \n \n80.  The subprogram 1 loan of $350 million will be released in a single tranche when it takes \neffect (i.e., all actions in boldface type in the subprogram 1 policy matrix in Appendix 3 must \nhave been satisfactorily complied with before the release of the tranche). The loan proceeds will \nbe used to finance the full foreign exchange cost (excluding local duties and taxes) of items \nproduced in and procured from ADB member countries, excluding ineligible items and imports \nfinanced  from  other  bilateral  and  multilateral  sources.  As  provided  in  ADB\u2019s  simplified \ndisbursement procedures and requirements for program loans,23 the proceeds of the program \nloan will be disbursed to the Republic of Indonesia as the Borrower. Under this program the \nGovernment  will  certify  that  the  value  of  total  imports  minus  (i)  imports  from  nonmember \ncountries, (ii) ineligible imports, and (iii) disbursements made under other official development \nassistance, is greater than the amount expected to be disbursed during the year. ADB reserves \nthe right to audit the use of the loan proceeds and to verify the accuracy of the Government\u2019s \ncertification. Disbursements will be made according to the simplified procedures for program \nloans. As provided in ADB\u2019s simplified disbursement procedures and related requirements for \nprogram loans, all goods and services procured must be produced in ADB member countries \nand  originate  in  such  countries,  with  due  consideration  to  economy  and  efficiency,  in \naccordance  with  the  Government\u2019s  standard  public  procedures  and  normal  private  sector \ncommercial  practices  acceptable  to  ADB.  Goods  commonly  traded  on  the  international \ncommodity  market  will  be  procured  according  to  procedures  appropriate  to  the  trade  and \nacceptable to ADB. Subprogram 1 will provide for retroactive financing for expenditures incurred \nby the Government 180 days before the loan takes effect. The Borrower has been informed that \nthe approval in principle of the retroactive financing does not commit ADB to finance this \nprogram. \n \n4.  Anticorruption and Fiduciary Issues \n \n81.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the Government. Consistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability, and \ntransparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged \n                                                 \n23 ADB. 1998.

To support these \nefforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the loan regulations \nand the bidding documents for the Program. In particular, all contracts financed by ADB in \nconnection with the Program shall include provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and \nexamine the records and accounts of the EA and all contractors, suppliers, consultants, and \nother service providers as they relate to the Program. \n \n82.  For the purpose of this program, an assessment of Indonesia\u2019s financial management \nsystems has been carried out to determine appropriate fiduciary arrangements. The diagnostic \nassessments were based on the World Bank\u2019s Indonesia Public Expenditure Review 200724. \nDiscussions with the Government during the formulation of subprogram 1 have taken into \nconsideration  the  ongoing  reforms  identified  in  these  diagnostic  studies.  The  assessment \nindicates that the fiduciary arrangements for the program are satisfactory.  \n \n83.  Indonesia has a strong record of aggregate fiscal discipline, as reflected in low budget \ndeficits and a relative low level of public debt. The country has made progress in reforming its \npublic finances and a sound regulatory framework for financial management is now in place. \nThe passage of the State Finance Law, the Treasury Law, the Audit Law, and the National \nDevelopment Planning Law were significant steps that brought Indonesia closer to conformity \nwith international practice. The laws are now being implemented, most notably to make the \nnational  budget  compatible  with  the  international  standard  government  financial  statistics \nclassification, establish a single treasury account to strengthen cash management, and unify the \npreviously separate recurrent and development budgets. Indonesia has a well-defined budget \nprocess with both the executive and the legislative branches adhering to defined schedules, and \nhigh transparency of the budget. But more attention needs to be paid to improving the strategic \nallocation  of  resources  through  performance-based  budgeting.  Weaknesses  also  remain  in \nvarious dimensions of budget execution including financial reporting and internal controls on \nbudget execution by spending agencies. Public investment budgets are disbursed slowly and a \ndisproportionately large share of funds is spent near the end of the fiscal year. \n \n84.  The  legal  and  regulatory  framework  for  public  procurement  has  improved  and  the \nGovernment Procurement Policy Office under the president is preparing standard procurement \nprocedures for the country, including standardized bidding documents. However, the capacity to \nimplement procurement has not kept pace. Pilot e-procurement initiatives and the introduction of \ntraining and certification of procurement practitioners are thus important undertakings. ADB is \nalso providing a TA to support e-procurement. The State Audit Law has strengthened the role of \nBPK, which now has sole charge of the external audit of all government organizations, while the \nState  Development  Audit  Agency  (Badan  Pengawasan  Keuangan  dan  Pembangunan,  or \nBPKP), together with the inspector general of each ministry, coordinates the internal audit and \nspecial investigations of the central Government, and the Regional Monitoring Board (Badan \nPengawasan  Daerah,  or  BAWASDA)  offices  manage  the  internal  audits  in  the  regional \ngovernments.  \n \n5.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n \n85.  ADB retains the right to audit the use of the loan proceeds and to verify the accuracy of \nthe Government\u2019s certification of withdrawal applications. Before withdrawal, the Government \n                                                 \n24 World  Bank.  2007.  Indonesia  Public  Expenditure  Review:  Spending  for  Development.

Performance Monitoring, Evaluation, and Program Review \n86.  In  coordination  with  the  committee,  ADB  will  periodically  review  the  progress  of \nimplementation  and  assess  the  impact  of  subprogram  1.  The  Government  will  keep  ADB \ninformed of the outcome of policy discussions with other multilateral and bilateral agencies that \nhave implications for LGFGR 2 implementation, and will provide ADB with the opportunity to \ncomment on any resulting policy proposals. ADB, in collaboration with the committee, will review \nthe performance of the program 12 months after the loan takes effect to review the outcome of \nsubprogram 1 and prepare for subprogram 2.  \n \n \nV.  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \n87.  In connection with subprogram 2, the Government has asked ADB for a $1.5 million \npolicy and advisory TA to be attached to this program. The assistance will support the ongoing \ndevelopment  of  the  reform  agenda  in  regional  government  financing  and  governance  (as \ncontained in the NAPFD and the policy matrix for subprogram 2) and its implementation, and \nprovide the Government with timely policy advice as needed. It is expected that, in the medium \nterm, another TA amounting to $1 million will be needed to support the reform agenda (see \npara. 88). The attached TA will focus on the Directorate General of Fiscal Balance of MOF and, \nsubject to further discussions, will have the following components: (i) revision of the NAPFD to \ncover the period up to 2010\u20132014, (ii) assistance in building a database and financial modeling \ncapacity in the directorate general to support the ongoing review of intergovernmental financing \nsystems, (iii) design and implementation of a system of forward estimates for intergovernmental \ntransfers and shared revenues, (iv) development and dissemination of new DAK regulations and \nguidelines,  (v)  development  and  implementation  of  a  targeted  package  of  incentives  and \nsanctions for selected intergovernmental transfers, (vi) support in implementing the early stages \nof devolution of the property tax, and (vii) human and systems capacity building in decentralized \nlocations. All components and cost estimates are described in Appendix 8.  \n \n88.  The  second  TA  of  $1  million  intended  to  achieve  subprogram  2  policy  actions  is \nexpected to be processed separately in 2009. Subject to more detailed consultations with the \nGovernment, the TA is likely to deal with (i) further policy options regarding the future status of \nDPOD; (ii) more efficient use of regional government labor resources with the help of a wage bill \nformula and regional government discretion in the use of the funds; (iii) amendment of sector \nlaws and regulations to make them consistent with the new expenditure assignments and other \ndecentralization laws; (iv) support for a creditworthy regional government in developing regional \nbond  issues,  including  training,  due-diligence  studies,  and  document  preparation;  (v) \npilot-testing and rollout of the regional government performance measurement system, and \ntraining  in  its  use;  (vi)  restructuring  of  regional  government  budgets  and  the  closure  or \nprivatization of low-priority and nonperforming activities or assets, including regional enterprises; \nand  (vii)  inventory  of  FMISs  in  171  regional  governments  to  review  options  for  further \nexpansion. Supplementary Appendix C describes all the proposed TA activities to support \nLGFGR 2.  \n ", "31 \nVI.  PROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACT, AND RISKS \nA.  Expected Impact \n89.  Over the medium term, LGFGR 2 provides for policy, administrative, and legal changes \nand capacity-building initiatives. The expected impact is more transparent, efficient, equitable, \nand  effective  management  and  use  of  public  resources  for  regional  development.  The \ninstitutional, financial, economic, and social benefits taken together should improve service \ndelivery, boost growth and employment, and reduce poverty in the regions. The most important \nexpected benefits are as follows.  \n \n90.   Institutional Benefits. The medium-term NAPFD will continue to be the framework for \nreform. LGFGR 2 will provide increasing technical support to the new Directorate General of \nFiscal Balance in MOF as the lead national agency for fiscal decentralization. Longer-term \ncapacity-building support for the president\u2019s decentralization adviser, DPOD, will help improve \nthe coordination of broader aspects of decentralization. Increased flexibility in the setting of \norganizational structures and staffing in the regional governments will facilitate restructuring \naway from high administrative expenditures. Ongoing long-term capacity building (of institutions, \nsystems, human resources) in the regional governments will also be significantly supported, \nparticularly  in  planning,  budgeting,  financial  management  and  reporting,  and  internal  and \nexternal audit. \n \n91.  Financial and Economic Benefits. Most benefits will come from improved financial and \neconomic management at all government levels. The benefits will be as follows: \n \n(i)  clearer  assignment  of  expenditures  between  levels  of  government,  and  thus \nmore efficient allocation of expenditures and better vertical balance in financing \nbetween levels of government; \n(ii)  improved criteria for establishing new regional governments, leading to greater \nefficiency  through  more  appropriately  established  and  sized  regional \ngovernments; \n(iii)  improved technical and policy environment for intergovernmental fiscal transfers \nand  revenue  sharing,  leading  to  more  transparent  and  equitable  outcomes \nacross regions (better horizontal balance); \n(iv)  improved policies conducive to the development of more buoyant own-source \nrevenues for regional governments, including a medium-term road map for tax \nreform and detailed options for decentralizing property taxes; \n(v)  strengthened  management  of  regional  reserves  with  the  help  of  improved \ninformation sources and policies; \n(vi)  enhanced policies and approaches (including restructuring and intercepting DAU \npayments)  for  dealing  with  the  long-standing  debt  arrears  of  regional \ngovernments and many of their utility companies; and \n(vii)  strengthened  governance  through  coordinated  performance  monitoring  and \nevaluation to improve accountability. \n \n92.   Social  Benefits.  While  most  of  the  benefits  will  be  financial  and  economic,  many \nimportant longer-term benefits sought are social in nature, particularly the improved delivery of \nthe many important public services that are now decentralized (including education, health, and \nphysical infrastructure). The benefits will take the form of (i) better defined service delivery \nneeds and performance in key sectors, and (ii) systems for performance evaluation monitoring \n ", "32 \nand benchmarking of regional government outcomes especially for meeting the needs of the \npoor. Appendix 6 discusses the poverty reduction impact of the program in greater detail.  \n \nB.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \n93.  While some risks are external and political, the program design and TA will mitigate \nthese  and  other  risks  by  providing  a  strong  broad-based  governance  framework,  with \ntransparency and accountability elements in both the central and regional governments. The \npotential risks to LGFGR 2 and the corresponding mitigating measures are as follows: \n \n(i)  Regional  government  leadership  and  capacity. The regional governments \nmay not have the necessary leadership, commitment, and capacity to innovate \nand  learn  and  to  translate  financial  resource  and  management  systems \nimprovements  into  better  services  and  reduced  poverty.  This  risk  will  be \nmitigated by improvements in (a) bottom-up accountability with better PFM and \ngreater  transparency  in  reporting,  (b)  vertical  organizational  structures  and \nhierarchical  responsibilities,  (c)  accountability  of  regional  governments  to \noversight  and  coordination  agencies,  (d)  accountability  through  the  electoral \nprocess, and (e) the regional civil service. \n(ii)  Political  change.  National  and  regional  government  elections  are  due  from \n2009. The new national or regional governments may not endorse the policy \nframework  in  the  NAPFD  and  LGFGR  2.  But  the  political  and  bureaucratic \nmomentum of reforms has been significant and growing with the rise of reform \nchampions, and is unlikely to be completely reversed by a new administration. \nSome allowance must, however, be made for new policy approaches at the \nmargins. \n(iii)  National coordination. Problems in coordination between key national agencies \ncould still delay program implementation despite the improvements made so far. \nThis risk has been mitigated by the emergence of the new Directorate General of \nFiscal Balance as the leader in fiscal aspects of decentralization and the longer-\nterm capacity-building efforts of the directorate general and DPOD. Moreover, all \nkey stakeholders will take part in revising the NAPFD in 2009, enhancing national \napproaches. Adequate representation of regional governments in coordination \nbodies will ensure strong ownership. \n(iv)  Flexibility of regional organizational structures. Organizations and their staff \nmay  resist  more  flexible  organizational  arrangements  and  staffing.  This \nresistance is likely to be offset by orderly and socially acceptable rightsizing, \ncombined  with  growing  community  support  for  spending  less  resources  on \nunproductive administration and more on productive activities. \n(v)  Horizontal equity between regions. Political and other pressures could delay \nthe more equitable distribution of transfers and shared revenues, and benefit of \nrelatively  better-off  natural  resource\u2013endowed  regions.  But  equalization  has \ngained important momentum with the removal of the \u201chold harmless\u201d provisions \nof  the  DAU  in  2008,  and  improved  analysis  and  transparency  in \nintergovernmental financial flows will increase accountability and create a larger \nconstituency in favor of further equalization.  \n(vi)  Revenue collection in the regions.  Political and bureaucratic opposition in the \ncentral  Government  could  stall  the  further  devolution  of  taxing  powers.  In  a \nbreakthrough move, the DPR is considering devolving property tax in a proposed \namendment to the tax law. In addition, a gradual medium-term approach to \n ", "33 \nrevenue reforms, based on a medium-term plan and well-researched and argued \ncases, is being taken and will be supported by LGFGR 2 and other programs.    \n(vii)  Fuel  prices  and  resource  constraints. Any increase in fuel subsidies may \nrequire the reallocation of resources from administrative expenditure, including \nreform  programs,  and  leave  the  Government  with  insufficient  resources  for \ncapacity development. The Government has therefore indicated that it will reduce \nthe fuel subsidy over the medium term. In addition, LGFGR 2 provides significant \nTA resources to support capacity building over the medium term through 2011. \nSupport from other development partners will also be used. \n \n94.  Conditions  for  Loan  Effectiveness. The loan will take effect after all the tranche \nconditions specified in the policy matrix (Appendix 3) are met. \nVII.  ASSURANCES  \n95.  In  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n(i)  Counterpart funds will be used to finance the structural adjustment costs and \nlocal currency costs relating to the implementation of the Program and other \nactivities consistent with the objectives of the Program, as more fully described in \nthe development policy letter (Appendix 2). \n(ii)  The  policies  and  actions  taken  prior  to  the  date  of  the  subprogram  1  loan \nagreement, as described in the development policy letter (including the policy \nmatrix), will continue to be in effect for the duration of the subprogram 1 and \nsubsequently.  \nVIII.  RECOMMENDATION \n96.  I am satisfied that the proposed program cluster and loan would comply with the Articles \nof Agreement of the Asian Development Bank and recommend that the Board approve: \n \n(i)  the  program  cluster  to  the  Republic  of  Indonesia  for  the  Second  Local \nGovernment Finance and Governance Reform Program; and \n \n(ii)  the loan of $350,000,000 equivalent to the Republic of Indonesia for subprogram \n1 of the Second Local Government Finance and Governance Reform Program, \nfrom  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources,  with  interest  to  be  determined  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)\u2013based lending \nfacility; a  term of 15 years, including a grace period of 3 years; and such other \nterms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in \nthe draft Program Loan Agreement presented to the Board. \n \n \nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident    \n \n24 October 2008 \n ", "34  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance Targets/  Data Sources/Reporting  Assumptions \nSummary  Indicators  Mechanisms  and Risks \nImpact      Risk \n\u2022 More efficient,  \u2022 Over 60% citizen  \u2022 GDS   \u2022 Insufficient leadership and \neffective, and  satisfaction with health    ownership in regional \nequitable regional  and education services    governments to translate \ngovernment spending  by 2011 (versus 58.1%    institutional capacity \n  satisfaction rating for    improvements into better \nhealth and 50.3% for    services and reduced \neducation in 2007)    poverty \n     \n\u2022 Less than 15% poor in  \u2022 BPS  Assumptions \nthe total population by    \u2022 Stronger bottom-up \n2011 (from 16.6% in    accountability with improved \n2007)    PFM and reporting \n    transparency \n\u2022 1 million more  \u2022 BPS  \u2022 Stronger vertical \nhouseholds gain access   \norganization structures and \nto piped water  hierarchical responsibilities \nconnection yearly, from \n\u2022 Stronger accountability of \na baseline of 9,449,505 \nregional governments to \nin 2005 \noversight and coordination \n \nagencies \n\u2022 Increased accountability \nthrough the electoral process\n\u2022 Regional civil service \nreforms initiated under the \nprogram  \nOutcome      Risk \n\u2022 Improved  \u2022 Increase in total DAK to  \u2022 BPS, SIKD, MOF  \u2022 Diminished support for \norganizational  0.8% of GDP by 2011    reforms from new \ncapacity of regional  from a baseline of    governments   \ngovernments, which  0.46% in 2008, at the     \noperate in a more  expense of incorrect    Assumption \ntransparent, effective,  deconcentrated funds    \u2022 Growing political and \nand efficient policy      bureaucratic momentum of \nand legal environment  \u2022 Decrease in regional  \u2022 MOF/BI monitoring system  reforms with emergence of \nfor fiscal  government reserves in    reform champions; polices \ndecentralization,  local bank accounts to    are therefore not expected to \nfinancial  2.5% of GDP or less by    be completely reversed, but \nmanagement, and  December 2010 from a    flexibility for changes must \nservice delivery   baseline of 3.1% in    be maintained at the margins \n  November 2006     \n   \n\u2022 Gradual increase in  \u2022 SIKD, MOF \nshares of regional \ngovernment sector \nspending for health (7% \nof total regional budget \nin 2004), agriculture \n(4%), infrastructure \n(17%), and environment \nand special planning \n(1%), at the expense of \ngovernment \nadministration spending \n(32%) \n \n ", "  Appendix 1  35 \nDesign  Performance Targets/  Data Sources/Reporting  Assumptions \nSummary  Indicators  Mechanisms  and Risks \nOutputs      Risk  \n1.

Introduction \n \n1.   This  appendix  analyzes  the  fiscal  decentralization  arrangements  and  trends  in \nIndonesia. The sections that follow cover: legal framework (section B); regional administration \nissues (section C); intergovernmental fiscal arrangements (section D); expenditure allocations \nand service delivery at regional levels (section E); fiscal decentralization and poverty reduction \n(section F); and capacity building for public financial management (PFM) (section G).   \n \n2.  Apart from the direct experiences gained under the First Local Government Finance and \nGovernance  Reform  Program  (LGFGR  1)  and  the  diagnostic  work  on  fiscal  aspects  of \ndecentralization undertaken during the country strategy and program preparation in 2006, the \ndesign of LGFGR 2 has benefited from a significant amount of sector diagnostic work of fiscal \naspects of decentralization between 2006 and 2008. This work included: (i) a comprehensive \nstock taking of fiscal decentralization, jointly undertaken by the Government and development \npartners; (ii) a diagnostic review of issues and preparation of the DSF medium-term work plan \nfor  fiscal  decentralization  of  the  Decentralization  Support  Facility  (DSF);  (iii)  an  extensive \ndiagnostic review of priority reforms considered in the design of the Second Local Government \nFinance and Governance Reform Program (LGFGR 2) and the project preparatory technical \nassistance (TA) for LGFGR 2; (iv) a public expenditure review with focus on fiscal aspects of \ndecentralization;  and  (v)  various  internal  government  reviews  (some  supported  by  Asian \nDevelopment Bank [ADB] TA) of progress in implementing LGFGR 1 and the National Action \nPlan for Fiscal Decentralization (NAPFD). \nB.   Background: Links between LGFGR 1 and LGFGR 2 \n3.  The details of and lessons from LGFGR 1 were fully considered in the development of \nLGFGR2;1 the two programs are integrally linked. In LGFGR 1, the desired outcome was \n\u201cincreased accountability in the management of LG finances.\u201d In LGFGR 2 the outcome has \nbeen somewhat broadened to \u201cimproved regional organizational capacities and operating in a \nmore transparent, effective and efficient policy and legal environment for fiscal decentralization, \nfinancial management and service delivery.\u201d In LGFGR 1, the desired longer-term impact was \n\u201cmore effective and efficient delivery of basic public services by regional governments.\u201d The \nlonger-term  impact  sought  under  LGFGR  2  is  broadly  similar:  \u201cimproved  efficiency, \neffectiveness and interregional equity of regional government spending.\u201d \n \n4.  LGFGR 1 had five core output areas, namely: (i) coordination and planning; (ii) regional \nadministration;  (iii)  intergovernmental  finance;  (iv)  planning,  budgeting,  and  PFM;  and \n(v) financial management information system (FMIS) development and project loan planning. As \nshown in the chart below, LGFGR 2 (subprograms 1 and 2) closely follows these core output \nareas of LGFGR 1, although minor reclassification has increased their number to six. Output \nareas  1  (coordination  and  planning)  and  2  (regional  administration)  are  the  same  in  both \nprograms. But while intergovernmental financing, regional government revenue policy, and debt \nmanagement were all contained in output area 3 in LGFGR 1, in LGFGR 2 these are now split \ninto  areas,  3,  4  and  5.  And  planning,  budgeting  and  financial  management,  and  FMIS \ndevelopment, which were in areas 4 and 5 in LGFGR 1, are all in output area 6 in LGFGR 2.  \n \n \n                                                 \n1 A fuller treatment of the links between LGFGR 1 and LGFGR 2 appears in Supplementary Appendix A. \n ", "  Appendix 5  55 \n \nCore Output Areas of LGFGR 1 and LGFGR 2 \n \n  LGFGR 1  LGFGR 2 \n \n \n  1.

LGFGR 1 covered the period from 2003 to 2005. The RRP for LGFGR 1 envisaged a \nmedium term approach to LGFGR development with at least two further medium term program \nloans to follow the first single tranche release of $ 300 million made in December 2005. The \nRRP for LGFGR 1 provided for some 14 indicative actions likely to be pursued under a second \nphase of LGFGR 1. These 14 indicative actions are set out in the Supplementary Appendix A, \nTable SAA.1 with commentary of their treatment in the LGFGR 2 policy matrix. As shown there \n13 of the 14 indicative actions have been provided for in the LGFGR 2 policy matrix. It can be \nnoted that the policy actions under LGFGR 2 go well beyond the levels envisaged at the time of \npreparing LGFGR 1, with current provision in Subprogram 1 for approximately 50 policy actions, \n20 of which have been bolded as core triggers.  \n \n6.  Table SAA.2 in Supplementary Appendix A in a more detailed way maps the links \nbetween actions under LGFGR 1 and LGFGR 2 (subprograms 1 and 2). To do this the basic \nstructure of the five output areas and 27 final actions of LGFGR 1 are taken as the starting \npoints and then all proposed actions under LGFGR 2 (subprograms 1 and 2) are mapped \nagainst these. Because the core output areas between LGFGR 1 and 2 are broadly similar it is \nrelatively straightforward. The mapping indicates that there has been no significant broadening \nof effort between LGFGR 1 and LGFGR 2 but there has been a significant deepening of the \nGovernment\u2019s reform effort. The general direction of deepening seems to be from:  \n \n ", "56  Appendix 5 \n \n \n(i)  Under LGFGR 1 finalizing higher level laws and regulations and commencing \ninitial work on central government institutional strengthening and making a broad \nstart on planning for regional government capacity development; \n(ii)  Under LGFGR 2 (subprogram 1) moving to near finalization of the regulatory \nregime (including lower level instruments) and intensification of policy reform \nwork to remove distortions and anomalies, while intensifying efforts at central \ninstitutional strengthening and planning for regional capacity building; and  \n(iii)  Under LGFGR 2 (subprogram 2) moving to a more mature stage of a near settled \nregulatory regime following the implementation of reforms to remove identified \npolicy while further deepening efforts at central institutional strengthening and \nregional government capacity building.  \nC.  Legal Framework \n  1.  Overview of the Evolving Framework \n7.  The \u201cbig bang\u201d reforms launched in 2001 involved a massive delegation of responsibility \nfor the provision of public services and the reassignment to regional governments of two thirds \nof central Government civil servants and more than 16,000 service delivery facilities. As a result, \nthe  share  of  regional  government  expenditures  in  total  government  expenditures  almost \ndoubled,  making  Indonesia  one  of  the  most-decentralized  countries  in  the  world.  The  two \noriginal fundamental decentralization laws were: (i) a law on local administration and autonomy \n(law 22/1999), and (ii) a law on financial balance between the central Government and the \nregions (law 25/1999). These two fundamental laws were both replaced in 2004 (see parts B3 \nand B4). Since the introduction of the new laws there has been a raft of new government and \nministerial  regulations  and  lower-level  instruments  passed  (more  than  50  of  them)  as \nIndonesia\u2019s regulatory regime moves closer to the end of the current phase.  \n \n8.  Fiscal decentralization has also been fundamentally influenced by the passage of four \nrelatively new foundation finance and planning laws in 2003 and 2004. These are: (i) law \n17/2003 on finance, (ii) law 1/2004 on the treasury, (iii) law 15/2004 on audit and supervision, \nand (iv) law 25/2004 on national development planning.  These foundation laws, which are \nmodern  in  nature,  drive  the  financial  management  and  governance  aspects  of  the  new \ndecentralization laws and approaches. \n2.  Law 34/2000 on Regional Taxes and Levies \n9.  Law 34/2000 sets out the taxes and charges assigned to regional governments, while \nat the same time leaving some flexibility to regional governments to design new types of taxes \nand charges that meet the defined criteria. Since 2006, the house of representatives (Dewan \nPerwakilan Rakyat, or DPR) has been reviewing draft amendments to this law, including the \nuse of a positive list of tax types, in part to minimize the growth of nuisance-type regional \ntaxes. The main prescribed provincial government taxes are those on (i) motor vehicles and \nvessels, (ii) changes in vessel and vehicle ownership, (iii) motor vehicle fuel, and (iv) water. \nThe main prescribed local government taxes are those on (i) hotels, (ii) restaurants, (iii) \nentertainment, (iv) advertising, (v) street lighting, (vi) minerals, and (vii) parking.  \n \n10.  The law sets the maximum tax rates that can be charged. It also provides for sharing \narrangements between (i) provinces, (ii) local governments, and (iii) villages, in relation to \nregional  taxes.  Other  laws  (particularly  law  33/2004)  also  provide  for  sharing  of  taxes \nassigned by the central Government with the regional governments. There is general revenue \n ", "  Appendix 5  57 \nsharing as well through the general allocation fund (Dana Alokasi Umum, or DAU) (26% of net \ncentral government revenues in 2008). In reality regional governments have limited revenue \nautonomy  as  the  central  Government  has  retained  control  of  the  main  taxes.  Important \nrevenue policy issues that have been under debate for some time are: (i) the limited extent of \nthe regional tax base and the possibility that additional taxes (such as property, income, or \nconsumption taxes) might be provided to the regions, and (ii) the fairness of the veto powers \nof the central Government regarding regional tax initiatives. \n \n  3.  Law 32/2004 on Regional Administration \n \n11.  In 2004 the new law 32/2004 replaced law 22/1999 on regional administration. The new \nlaw aimed for consistency with new laws on public finance, treasury, audit, and planning. The \nlaw covered (i) the formation, breakup, and merger of regional governments; (ii) the assignment \nof expenditures; (iii) responsibilities and authorities of key officials; (iv) the political structure; (v) \nthe  civil  service  structure;  (vi)  higher-level  vetting  of  regional  budgets;  (vii)  planning;  (viii) \nperformance-based  budgeting;  (ix)  borrowing;  (x)  deficits,  reserve  funds,  and  regional \nenterprises;  (xi)  disputes  and  cooperation;  (xii)  village  management;  (xiii)  supervision  and \ncapacity development; and (iv) the president\u2019s Regional Autonomy Advisory Council (Dewan \nPertimbangan Otonomi Daerah, or DPOD). While fiscal decentralization matters are mainly \ncovered in law 33/2004, law 32/2004 also covers many fiscal matters and this has been a \nsource of confusion from time to time. The new law 32/2004 to some extent reestablished a \nhierarchical role for the provinces vis-\u00e0-vis the local governments, addressing a perceived \ncentral need to exercise more central government oversight and control. \n \n12.  Under law 32/2004 the central Government reserved for itself a very short list of national \nresponsibilities (international relations, defense and security, monetary and fiscal policies, and \nreligious affairs). Provinces and local governments were broadly assigned the same obligatory \naffairs; however, the provinces operate region-wide while local governments undertake local \nservice delivery. There are 16 obligatory regional affairs under the law, namely: (i) development \nplanning, (ii) planning and zoning, (iii) public order and peace, (iv) public means and facilities, \n(v)  health,  (vi)  education  and  human  resources,  (vii)  social  services,  (viii)  manpower,  (ix) \ncooperatives and small and medium-sized enterprises, (x) environment, (xi) agrarian services, \n(xii) demography and civil registry, (xiii) government administration, (xiv) capital investments, \n(xv) other basic services, and (xvi) others. Within the resource availabilities, regions may pursue \nadditional optional affairs. Some services have authority to be delivered solely by one level of \ngovernment while others may involve sharing between levels. \n \n13.  Government regulation 38/2007 sought to further clarify the assignment of expenditures. \nThe  government  regulation  reaffirms  the  central  Government\u2019s  control  over  the  seven \nabovementioned areas exclusively reserved for it, then distributes all other areas among the \nother levels of government. About 31 areas (or sectors) are joint responsibilities (sectors are \nfurther divided into subsectors and sub-subsectors in a detailed appendix to the government \nregulation). The detailed appendix sets out in matrix form for each sector, subsector, and \nsub-subsector the responsibilities of (i) the central Government, (ii) the provincial governments, \nand (iii) the local governments. Matters assigned to regional governments are further divided \ninto the mandatory and the optional.  \n    \n14.   Government  regulation  38/2007  lists  26  obligatory  regional  government  areas \n(compared with only 15 in the law): (i) education, (ii) health, (iii) environment, (iv) public works, \n(v)  spatial  layout,  (vi)  development  plan,  (vii)  housing,  (viii)  youth  and  sports,  (ix)  capital \ninvestment, (x) cooperatives and small and medium-sized enterprises, (xi) population and civil \n ", "58  Appendix 5 \n \n \nregistry, (xii) manpower, (xiii) food security, (xiv) women and children, (xv) family planning, (xvi) \ntransport, (xvii) communications and information, (xviii) defense, (xix) state unity and domestic \npolicy, (xx) regional administration and finance, (xxi) community and village empowerment, (xxii) \nsocial affairs, (xxiii) culture, (xxiv) archives, and (xxv) libraries. Optional affairs depend on \nregional characteristics and consist of (i) marine and fisheries, (ii) agriculture, (iii) forestry, (iv) \nmining and energy, (v) tourism, (vi) industry, (vii) trade, and (viii) transmigration. \n \n15.  Central ministries are now required to issue by 2009 detailed policy instruments in the \nform  of  (i)  norms,  (ii)  standards,  (iii)  procedures,  and  (iv)  criteria,  in  relation  to  the \nimplementation of regional obligatory and optional affairs. Regional governments are to issue \nsimilar regional regulations by 2008. If the central Government does not issue these statements \nthen the regions shall determine their own policies by issuing similar statements. No central \ngovernment  ministries  or  regional  governments  are  known  to  have  prepared  the  required \ninstruments, although some are working on them. Law 32/2004 requires the preparation of \nfurther detailed regulations in 17 different subject areas, the great bulk of which have been \ncompleted in recent years, while a small number are still being drafted. \n \n  4.  Law 33/2004 on Fiscal Balance Arrangements  \n \n16.  The new law 33/2004 requires central public finance policy to focus on redistribution and \nstabilization matters, and the regions on allocation, effectiveness, and efficiency of services. \nIntergovernmental financing, while based on paramount central authority, aims for fair sharing of \nauthority  and  responsibilities  and  recognizes  principles  of  regional  equalization  and  the \nnecessity of having adequate money follow decentralized functions. The law covers (i) sources \nand uses of regional financing,(ii) local own-source revenues (Pendapatan Asli Daerah, or \nPAD), (iii) revenue sharing (Dana Bagi Hasil, or DBH), (iv) natural resource sharing, (v) general \ntransfers (DAU), (vi) the specific allocation fund (Dana Alokasi Khusus, or DAK), (vii) grants and \nemergency funds, (viii) regional borrowing, (ix) principles of financial management, (x) budget \npreparation, (xi) budget execution, (xii) financial accountability and supervision, (xiii) deficit \ncontrol, (xiv) deconcentrated funding, (xv) co-administered funding, and (xvi) the integrated \nregional financial information system (Sistem Informasi Keuangan Daerah, or SIKD). \n \n17.  The  regional  financing  categories  are:  (i)  decentralized  responsibilities,  (ii) \ndeconcentrated central expenditures, and (iii) co-administered expenditures. A fundamental aim \nis to provide for reasonable equalization between regions with narrowing of fiscal gaps, broadly \ndefined  as  regional  fiscal  needs  minus  regional  fiscal  capacity.  Funding  sources  for \ndecentralized matters are: (i) PAD; (ii) the equalization funds (DBH, DAU, DAK); (iii) regional \nborrowing;  and  (iv)  other  sources.  The  central  Government  sets  regional  total  debt  limits \nannually and can also impose other restrictions on the nature of regional government debt \nissues. The law sets out the general principles of budgeting and public financial management \n(PFM), which mainly mirror the finance, treasury, and audit laws.  \n \n18.  An annual financial statement (by way of law) is submitted to the regional house of \nrepresentatives (Dewan Perwakilan Rakyat Daerah, or DPRD) by regional governments by 30 \nJune each year for the previous financial year. It contains an audited annual financial report \ncovering  at  least  (i)  budget  realization  (revenues,  expenditures,  and  output  and  results \nperformance of all work units; (ii) balance sheet; (iii) cash flow report; and (iv) notes, including \nreports from regional state enterprises. Financial reporting is to be in line with government \naccounting  standards.  The  financial  statements  are  to  be  audited  by  the  Supreme  Audit \nAuthority (Badan Pemeriksa Keuangan, or BPK) each year and at the end of the term of the \nregional head and the DPRD.  \n ", "  Appendix 5  59 \n19.  Since the passage of law 33/2004 a number of more detailed regulations and decrees \nthat further elaborate on matters contained in the law have been passed. The more important of \nthese  are  government  regulations  (i)  55/2005  on  fiscal  balance,  (ii)  54/2005  on  regional \nborrowing, (iii) 56/2005 on the regional financial information system, (iv) 58/2005 and 39/2007 \non regional financial management, and (v) 7/2008 on deconcentration and coadministration \nfunds management, as well as MOHA regulations 13/2006 and 59/2007 on regional financial \nmanagement. \n \nD.  Regional Administration Issues \n \n20.  Proliferation of New Regional Governments. From 2000 to 2006, six new provinces \nand about 100 local governments (80 kabupaten and 18 cities) were created. Just recently 27 \nnew regional governments were approved by DPR and many more proposals are waiting in the \nwings. This trend, partly an opportunistic response to fiscal incentives in the system, particularly \nthe sharing of resource revenues, is widely perceived to reduce the overall efficiency of regional \ngovernments.  Recent  policies  have  slowed  down  new  approvals  and  then  imposed  a \nmoratorium (lifted in late June 2008) on approvals pending the completion of a revised policy \nframework. The costs of proliferation are considerable: economies of scale are lost in the \ndelivery  of  public  services,  unit  costs  go  up,  and  the  new  governments,  lacking  a  sound \neconomic base to raise their own revenues, could end up depending even more on transfers \nfrom the center. On the other hand, local residents gain more representation and access to their \nlocal representatives, and local governments are pushed to become more accountable and \nefficient in their daily operations. Empirical studies in other countries show that at least 10,000 \nresidents are needed to exploit economies of scale in the delivery of most services. There is \nwide  agreement  on  the  need  for  more  study  and  discussion  to  close  the  apparent  divide \nbetween the DPR\u2019s position (generally favorable to regional government proliferation) and the \ncentral executive (MOHA and MOF) position (generally antagonistic to such further creation).  \n \n21.  Vertical Structure of Subnational Governments. The initial decentralization reforms \nremoved any hierarchical relationships between the provinces and the districts/cities, partly out \nof fear that strong provincial governments would spawn separatist movements. The special \nstatus Laws for Aceh and Papua and the general evolution of domestic politics removed that \nreason  for  eschewing  a  hierarchical  vertical  model.  Law  32/2004  brought  back  different \nchannels  of  hierarchical  control  by  the  provinces,  including  the  annual  approval  of  local \ngovernment  budgets.  These  reversals  reflect  a  central  government  desire  for  enhanced \noversight and control over local governments and using the provincial authorities, in particular \nthe Governor, as a proxy for central authority. There are benefits to be derived from this new \nsetup, but there are also costs, including the tendency for intermediate level governments to act \nin discriminatory ways towards lower levels. Careful assessment is warranted of the pros and \ncons of reverting to hierarchical relationships between provincial and local governments and \nwhat can be learned from the practice in other unitary states.  \n \n22.  Expenditure  Assignments.  Government  functions  are  imprecisely  defined.  Law \n22/1999, taking an all-inclusive approach to the responsibilities of regional governments, simply \nlisted the exclusive functions of the central Government and did not make clear which other \nfunctions were obligatory and which were optional for the regional governments. Full clarification \nof the obligatory functions of regional governments was also not made in law 32/2004 but \ninstead was deferred until the issuance of government regulation 38/2007. It remains to be seen \nwhether the new government regulation provides the necessary clarity, particularly in areas of \njoint  responsibility,  which  predominate  in  the  regulation.  Furthermore,  the  difficult  task  of \nrevising all sector laws and regulations to be consistent with the new government regulation still \n ", "60  Appendix 5 \n \n \nremains. There are potential pitfalls to the approach required under government regulation \n38/2007, including: (i) the inconsistency of instruments that may be prepared by the central \nGovernment and regional governments; and (ii) the possibility that central policy statements \nmay  seek  to  exert  excessive  control  over  decentralized  affairs.  While  the  objectives  of \ngovernment  regulation  38/2007  of  clarifying  expenditure  assignments  at  different  levels  of \ngovernment remain valid and extremely important, the bureaucratic processes prescribed for \nfinalizing policy instruments and making laws and regulations consistent imply too many more \nadministrative challenges to be practical. \n \nE.  Intergovernmental Fiscal Arrangements \n \n1.  Overview \n \n23.  As shown in Table A5.1, the total resources available to all regional governments grew \nstrongly from 6.9% of GDP in 2001 (Rp103.4 trillion) to 8.4% of GDP in 2006 (Rp279.0 trillion). \nAll forms of revenue grew sharply in absolute terms. However, in terms of share of resources \nthe DAU declined somewhat in importance between 2001 and 2006 (although still at 52.2% of \ntotal resources in 2006). The DAK (4.1% of total resources in 2006, versus 1.1% in 2001) and \nshared revenues (23.3% in 2006 and 21.0% in 2001) have been the main sources of resource \ngrowth for regional governments. Rapidly growing regional resources have led to a common \nview that most regions now have enough resources to make a difference in the lives of their \ncitizens and that many regional governments, at least in the short term, have had difficulties \nspending their additional resources. The challenge for many regional governments is not so \nmuch few resources but rather spending the available resources well.  \n \nTable A5.1: Total Resources of Regional Governments \n(Provinces, Kabupaten, and Kota), 2001\u20132006  \n(Rp billion and as % of GDP) \n \n2001  2002  2003  2004  2005  2006 \nItem  Actual  Actual  Actual  Actual  Actual  Actual \nTotal Regional Resources             \n     DAU    60,742.0    69,554.0    78,414.8    82,027.5    89,353.3  145,685.4 \n     DAK    1,123.0      2,648.9      3,363.4      3,038.7      4,252.1    11,569.8 \n     Shared taxes and resources    21,688.8    24,309.1    30,290.0    34,071.2    49,829.0    65,107.0 \n     PAD    15,471.7    22,181.7    26,059.4    32,013.8    37,964.2    40,739.8 \n     Other revenues      4,420.6      5,232.9    10,605.7    13,916.8    15,378.7    15,872.8 \n     Total Regional Resources  103,446.2  123,926.6  148,733.5  165,067.9  196,777.2  278,974.8 \n     As % of GDP            6.9               6.8             7.4             7.2             7.1             8.4 \n% Share of Total Regional Resources             \n     DAU           58.7           56.1           52.7           49.7           45.4           52.2 \n     DAK             1.1             2.1             2.3             1.8             2.2             4.1 \n     Shared taxes and resources           21.0           19.6           20.4           20.6           25.3           23.3 \n     PAD           15.0           17.9           17.5           19.4           19.3           14.6 \n     Other revenues             4.3             4.2             7.1             8.4             7.8             5.7 \n     Total Regional Resources         100.0         100.0         100.0         100.0         100.0         100.0 \nSources: Central Bureau of Statistics (BPS), Supreme Audit Authority (BPK), MOF regional financial information \nsystem (SIKD), central government financial report (LKPP). \n \n2.  Own Revenues (PAD) \n \n24.  Reforms have so far failed to give the regional governments significant tax autonomy; \nhence, political accountability among these governments is low. Regional governments are still \nfunded mainly by revenue sharing and intergovernmental transfers. In 2006, provincial PAD \n ", "  Appendix 5  61 \nmade up 42.5% of provincial revenues while local government PAD represented only 5.9% of \ntotal local revenues. These proportions have not changed much since 2001. Most regional \nrevenues are raised by provincial governments. While the absolute value of regional PAD grew \nquite sharply between 2001 and 2006 (from Rp15.5 trillion to Rp40.7 trillion), as a proportion of \nGDP it climbed less significantly (from 1.04% to 1.22% of GDP) although it did reach 1.39% of \nGDP in 2004 before declining in relative terms. Consideration should be given to enhancing \nthose taxes over which regional governments have authority to change either the rate or the \nbases.  \n \n25.  Any  further  devolution  of  taxing  powers  must  recognize  the  limited  administrative \ncapacity of many regional governments. The best candidate for devolution remains the property \ntax, now administered fully by the central Government, which defines the tax base and sets the \nrates  and  then  distributes  the  collected  revenues  among  the  regional  governments  while \nretaining 9% of receipts as an administrative fee.2 The property tax is far from being used at its \nfull potential\u2014the valuation of properties is deficient and the statutory rates are very low (0.1%\u2013\n0.2%). Collection efficiency is also very low, with less than half of the tax liabilities finally \ncollected. One option for devolving the property tax would be to give the regional governments \ndiscretion to set rates between a minimum and a maximum set by the DPR. The administration \nof the tax could stay centralized at first, although the collection fee of 9% should be reviewed. \nOver time, it may be possible to further decentralize administration.  \n \n3.  Unconditional Equalization Grant (DAU) \n \n26.  Recent trends in DAU transfers are shown in Table A5.2. The total DAU has increased \nsharply, from Rp60.7 trillion in 2001 to Rp179.8 trillion in 2008, with the return to growth in the \neconomy, although its share of GDP has remained relatively constant since 2001, at around \n4%. The DAU-to-GDP ratios have also been relatively constant for provincial governments (at \naround  0.4%)  and  local  governments  (3.6%).  DAU  funding  represents  up  to  80%  of  total \nrevenues for some regional governments, but much less for those with considerable resources \nfrom revenue sharing. For all regional governments in 2006, the DAU provided 52.2% of total \nresources, down from 58.7% in 2001. \n \nTable A5.2: DAU Transfers to Provinces/Districts/Cities, 2001\u20132008 \n \n2001  2002  2003  2004  2005  2006  2007  2008 \nItem  Actual  Actual  Actual  Actual  Actual  Actual  Actual  Actual \n(In Rp Billion)                 \nTransfers to    6,462.9    7,351.3    8,288.4    8,698.6    9,183.0    14,571.4    16,478.7    17,980.7 \nProvinces \nTransfers to  54,279.1  62,202.7  70,230.4  73,328.9  80,170.4  131,114.1  148,308.7  161,769.3 \nDistricts and \nCities \nTotal DAU  60,742.0  69,554.0  78,518.8  82,027.5  89,353.3  145,685.4  164,787.4  179,750.0 \n% Growth           14.5         12.9           4.5           8.9           63.0           13.1             9.1 \n(As % of Total GDP)               \nTransfers to         0.43         0.40         0.41         0.38         0.33           0.44           0.42           0.40 \nProvinces \nTransfers to         3.6         3.4         3.5         3.2         2.9           3.9           3.7           3.6 \nDistricts/Cities \nTotal DAU         4.1         3.8         3.9         3.6         3.2           4.4           4.2           4.0 \nSources: Central Bureau of Statistics (BPS), Supreme Audit Authority (BPK), MOF regional financial information \nsystem (SIKD), central government financial report (LKPP). \n                                                 \n2  In 2005 property tax revenues were Rp16 trillion, amply exceeding regional government PAD. However, property \ntaxes on the extractive sector were almost 75% of all revenues, urban areas 20%, and rural areas 3.4%. \n ", "62  Appendix 5 \n \n \n27.  The subject of constant reform since its introduction in 2001, the DAU has progressively \nrisen to 26% of net central government revenues, from 25% in 2004. The DAU since 2006 has \nused the formula of fiscal gap and basic allocation funding significant parts of the wage bills of \nall regional governments. The computation of fiscal capacity (fiscal need minus fiscal capacity) \nnow fully includes all shared revenues, including those from natural resources, in addition to \nown revenues. A \u201chold harmless\u201d provision has effectively worked against the equalizing effects \nof the DAU, so the Government has effectively eliminated the provision from 2008 (although \nregional governments that were adversely affected have received some compensatory funding \nof up to 25% of the 2007 DAU through other non-DAU parts of the budget). The basic allocation \nfor wages (always positive) can now be offset by negative equalization allocations. After offsets, \nregions can receive zero (but not negative) DAU.  \n \n28.  One recent policy issue has been the use of actual revenue collection data in the \nformulas instead of a measure of revenue potential per region (as originally intended), because \nof difficulties in generating data. This diminishes the incentives for regional governments to \nincrease their PAD, as higher PAD collections are matched by lower DAU transfers. Another \nimportant DAU policy issue has been the serious perverse incentives introduced by the funding \nof the significant wage bills of all regional governments through the basic allocation of the DAU. \nRegional governments are encouraged to employ more staff despite broad concerns about their \nexcessive administrative costs. Recent proportions of funds allocated by the fiscal gap part of \nthe DAU formula have been only around 50% of the total DAU pool. Moreover, staffing levels \nvary widely between regions. In 2006, among the local governments, the extremes were 0.44 \nstaff for every 1,000 people in Kabupaten Serdang Berdagi and 111.7 for every 1,000 in \nKabupaten Halmahera Tengah. \n4.  Shared Revenues (DBH) \n29.  In part because of recent increases in oil and gas revenues, resource-rich regions have \nseen their revenue-sharing allocations grow sharply (by 46.2% in 2005 and 30.7% in 2006). \nRecent trends are set out in Table A5.3. Central government revenue sharing with all regional \ngovernments has risen sharply, from Rp21.7 trillion in 2001 (1.5% of GDP) to Rp65.1 trillion in \n2006 (2.0% of GDP). The great bulk of revenue sharing (around 70% recently, up from 65% in \n2001) goes to the local governments. Revenue sharing is now approaching half of DAU levels. \nThe main forms of revenue sharing are (i) land tax and buildings, (ii) land and building title \ntransfers, (iii) personal income taxes, and (iv) natural resource revenues. \n \nTable A5.3: Regional Share in National Tax and Non-tax Revenues \n(Including Natural Resources), 2001\u20132008 \n \n2001  2002  2003  2004  2005  2006 \nItem  Actual  Actual  Actual  Actual  Actual  Actual \n(In Rp Billion)             \nShared with Provinces      7,511.3       8,399.5       9,959.1     11,647.2     15,514.0     18,412.2 \nShared with Districts and Citiesa    14,177.5     15,906.6     20,830.8     22,424.0     34,315.0     46,694.8 \nTotal Shared Revenue    21,688.8     24,309.1     30,790.0     34,071.2     49,829.0     65,107.0 \n% Growth              12.1            26.7            10.7            46.2            30.7 \n(As % of Total GDP)             \nShared with Provinces            0.50            0.46            0.49            0.51            0.56            0.55 \nShared with Districts and Cities            1.0            0.9            1.0            1.0            1.2            1.4 \nTotal Shared Revenue            1.5            1.3            1.5            1.5            1.8            2.0 \na Excludes transfers from the provinces. \nSources: Central Bureau of Statistics (BPS), Supreme Audit Authority (BPK), MOF regional financial information \nsystem (SIKD), central government financial report (LKPP). \n ", "  Appendix 5  63 \n30.  A number of policy issues related to revenue sharing are under consideration. First, \nsome provisions allow equal revenue sharing by province or district. This provides wide scope \nfor distortion and inequity, given the major variations in sizes of provinces and districts. Second, \nrevenue sharing is dispersed very inequitably (mainly based on derivation principles), thus \nacting as a significant countervailing force to DAU equalization objectives. Finally, the proportion \nof revenues going to different levels of government continues to be a matter of hot political \ndebate in Indonesia, as is the case in many countries. \n \n5.  Conditional Grants (DAK) \n \n31.  Although the DAK has increased strongly in absolute and relative importance (from \nRp1.1 trillion and 0.08% of GDP in 2001 to Rp21.2 trillion and 0.47% of GDP in 2008), these \nfunds still represent a small share of total regional government revenues (around 5% of total \nrevenues for local governments in 2006 with negligible recent provincial DAK funding). DAK \namounts are set annually in the central government budget to support special activities in the \nregions in line with government criteria, although not all regions receive DAK. The law provides \nthree very general criteria for managing DAK: (i) financial needs, (ii) key regional or geographic \ncharacteristics, and (iii) technical infrastructure standards. The criteria do not provide for a \nnondiscretionary approach to the selection of the total amount or specific allocations. Generally \nregions are to provide matching funds equivalent to at least 10% of DAK allocations, although \nthis  requirement  may  be  waived  for  poorer  regions.  There  is  scope  for  restructuring  and \nrefocusing the DAK on the basis of clearer principles and objectives. Ideally DAK should be \nreformed as part of the emerging medium-term expenditure framework (MTEF). \n \n6.  Deconcentration Expenditures \n \n32.  The deconcentrated expenditures of the central Government in regional locations are \nnow a significant policy issue. In 2006 the central Government spent some Rp24.7 trillion (about \n5.2% of its total expenditures) on deconcentration matters. The great bulk of these funds went \nto (i) education (Rp17.8 trillion), (ii) health (Rp2.7 trillion), and (iii) agriculture (Rp1.1 trillion). \nOther  significant  amounts  were  thought  to  be  spent  on  infrastructure  but  are  not  formally \nrecorded  as  deconcentration  expenditures.  Law  33/2004  provides  for  the  channeling  of \nnon-legitimate deconcentration funds to increase the DAK. However, the line ministries typically \nseek to delay the shift. Government regulation 38/2007 on expenditure assignments, along with \nthe improved ability of the central Government to set the ceiling for and screen budgets, widens \nthe scope for identifying and reallocating non-legitimate deconcentration funds. An alternative \napproach to switching funds to DAK would be to switch deconcentration funds to the DAU (e.g., \nthrough an upward adjustment in the 26%-of-net-revenue formula) and to let those funds be \nused by the regional governments for functions now administered by the line ministries. The \napproach chosen\u2014whether to reinforce the DAK or the DAU\u2014will depend on the degree of \nconfidence in the appropriate functioning of a reformed DAK. \n7.  Horizontal Balance in Regional Expenditure \n33.  There are notable differences in per capita expenditures between regions. In 2006 at the \nextremes Papua province spent about 17 times as much per capita than the lowest-spending \nprovince  (Jawah  Tengah).  Expenditure  disparities  between  the  highest-spending  district \n(Kabupaten Sarmi in Papua) and the lowest-spending district (Kabupaten Bogor in Jawah Barat) \nare even wider, at around 50:1 in 2006. On the one hand, such disparities reflect the limitations \nof the DAU as recently structured to equalize fiscal gaps. On the other hand, the higher per \ncapita outlays in Papua, for example, are understandable, as it has the highest incidence of \n ", "64  Appendix 5 \n \n \npoverty of any province despite relatively high per capita gross regional domestic product \n(GRDP) (Rp29.3 million in 2005, compared with the median per capita GRDP of Rp8.0 million). \nDisparities in public services and standards of living are still considerable across regions, so the \nGovernment is intensifying the emphasis on regional development policies to bring about more \ngeographic balance and to help reduce poverty in poorer areas.  \n8.  Regional Borrowing \n34.  A current paradox is the virtual absence of new borrowing by regional governments \ndespite the immense need for basic infrastructure at the local level. Much regulatory attention \non regional borrowing has focused on regulating the demand side of local credit markets, which \nhave failed to develop in part because of the poor repayment performance of many regional \ngovernments.  The  new  regulatory  framework  introduces  new  rules  for  onlending,  but  the \nprocesses  remain  cumbersome  and  restrictive,  and  borrowing  is  allowed  only  for \nrevenue-generating  projects.  Furthermore,  the  unclear  assignment  of  expenditure \nresponsibilities, especially those related to construction and maintenance of infrastructure, has \ninduced regional governments to wait for central government funds. In addition, public utility \nregulations stifle the demand for credit. For example, regional governments cannot pledge their \nrevenues or assets except in the case of revenue bonds, and they cannot guarantee the loans \nof regional water utility companies (PDAMs). On the other hand, poor maintenance and cost \nrecovery practices have made many PDAMs technically insolvent. Further policy development is \nneeded to encourage PDAMs to function better (raise tariffs to allow cost recovery, lower \noperation costs, and maintain capital investment) and for regional governments in general to \nbecome more responsible in maintaining infrastructure. Regional government improvements in \ncapital budgeting and project implementation capacity would also help.  \n9.  Regional Reserves \n35.  The large cash reserves of many regional governments\u2014around 3% of GDP\u2014present a \nfurther  issue  related  to  vertical  balance  in  intergovernmental  financing.  (The  extent  of  the \nreserves, however, varies widely between regions.) Beyond loan repayment and infrastructure \nfinancing  needs,  regions  rich  in  natural  resources  and  with  large  reserves  (e.g.,  Aceh, \nKalimantan Timur, Papua, and Riau) could be encouraged to create trust or inheritance funds to \nbenefit future generations. \nE.  Expenditure Allocations and Service Delivery at Regional Levels \n  1.  Regional Expenditure Allocations \n36.  Regional governments have come to play the key role in the delivery of core social \nservices,  including  education,  health,  and  the  development  of  physical  infrastructure.  In \nassessing  performance  it  must  be  recognized  that  decentralization  is  a  relatively  new \nexperience for Indonesia. Analysis is also hindered by data availability problems. From the \nperspective of functional expenditure composition, the current mix of expenditures is less than \noptimal. Education has become increasingly the most important sector in the regional budgets. \nExpenditures on public health services have not increased significantly and still represent a \nrelatively  low  share  of  public  budgets.  On  the  other  hand,  government  administration \nexpenditure is the second most important type of expenditure in regional budgets. As shown in \nTable A5.4, among the regional governments routine expenditures are around 65% of total \nexpenditures and very high proportions of these go solely to personnel costs. \n ", "  Appendix 5  65 \nTable A5.4: Routine, Development, and Total Expenditures \nof Regional Governments, 2001\u20132005a \n \n2001  2002  2003  2004  2005 \nItem  Actual  Actual  Actual  Actual  Actual \n(In Rp billion)           \nTotal Regional Expenditure           \nRoutine Expenditure  62,656.4  73,445.5  84,476.5  95,104.7  102,268.1 \nDevelopment Expenditure  30,038.6  43,131.6  58,820.0  53,206.8  55,783.7 \nTotal Expenditure  92,695.0  116,577.1  143,296.4  148,311.5  158,051.7 \n(As % of Total)           \nTotal Expenditure           \nRoutine Expenditure  67.6  63.0  59.0  64.1  64.7 \nDevelopment Expenditure  32.4  37.0  41.0  35.9  35.3 \nTotal Expenditure  100.0  100.0  100.0  100.0  100.0 \na Total regional expenditure = expenditure of provinces, districts, and cities. \nSources: Central Bureau of Statistics (BPS), Supreme Audit Authority (BPK), MOF regional financial information \nsystem (SIKD), central government financial report (LKPP). \n \n37.  From an economic classification perspective, a significant part of the budget goes to \nwages and salaries (for teachers, government officials, etc.), with salary levels still controlled \nfrom the center. Too little is spent on supplies and equipment. Local health clinics, for example, \noften lack basic medications, clean water, and electricity, and suffer from high absenteeism \namong health personnel. Regional governments also spend too little on physical infrastructure; \ncentral government agencies continue to control around 50% of infrastructure spending, despite \nthe fact that these responsibilities have been legally decentralized.  \n \n38.  From the limited evidence available, service delivery performance has been mixed, but \nthere are indications that the quality of some services has improved. A recent World Bank \nsurvey3 concluded that decentralized services in education, health, and general administration \nhave  improved  in  quality,  while  police  services,  which  have  not  been  decentralized,  have \ndeteriorated. It is important to keep in mind that before 2001 access to many basic services was \nvery low and that these deficiencies persist. The broad-based Human Development Index has \nshown some improvement, from 65.8 in 2002 to 69.6 in 2005, and some narrowing in dispersion \nin index levels between provinces.  \n2.  Education Expenditure and Services \n39.  Recent national education expenditures are approaching 4% of GDP, up from 2% of \nGDP in 2001. With close to 17% of total public expenditures going to education, the country is \nspending at good international standards adjusted for income per capita. The lion\u2019s share of \ngrowth in education expenditures has been in the regional governments (especially the local \ngovernments), from negligible levels in 2000 to around 2% of GDP in 2004. Nevertheless, \ncentral government expenditures have not decreased very significantly (from around 1.3% to \n0.9%  of  GDP  in  2004).  Most  of  them  go  to  teachers\u2019  salaries,  with  a  simple  switch  in \nadministrative  responsibilities  from  the  central  Government  to  the  regional  governments. \nEvolution in the quality of education management and outcomes still needs to be assessed over \na longer period with more direct measures of education services, such as attendance rates and \nstandardized  test  scores,  not  readily  available  at  the  present  time,  although  major  quality \nproblems in education delivery are commonly thought to exist.   \n                                                 \n3  Kaiser, Kai, Daan Pattinasarany, and G\u00fcnther G.

Chapter 7, pp. 164\u2013207. \n ", "66  Appendix 5 \n \n \n40.  Most broader indicators of education performance show some improvement in the first 5 \nyears after decentralization reforms. Indonesia ranks well internationally in primary schooling, \nwith net enrollment rates recently (2005) increasing to 95.5%. Net enrollment has also improved \nin junior secondary schools (to 65.2%) and senior secondary schools (to 41.7%), and generally \nin  all  seconary  schools  (from  48.6%  in  2000  to  58.3%  in  2005).  There  has  been  some \nimprovement as well in adult literacy, from 89.3% in 2001 to 90.9% in 2005, although there are \nwide regional variations. \n3.  Health Expenditure and Services \n41.  Total expenditures on public health, despite a moderate increase in recent years, are still \nless than 2% of GDP, little changed from the 2001 total, which was quite low by international \nstandards. Public-health spending by local governments did increase sharply after 2001 (from \n11.5% of sector expenditures in 2000 to 42.9% in 2006). This increase was largely offset by \ndecreases  in  health  expenditures  by  the  central  Government  (from  64.3%  of  sector \nexpenditures  in  2000  to  41.2%  in  2006).  Expenditures  in  the  health  sector  by  provincial \ngovernments have declined relatively from 24.2% in 2000 to 15.8% in 2006.  \n \n42.  Health indicators place the country well below other countries in the region in key health \noutputs,  including  life  expectancy,  under-5  mortality  rate,  maternal  mortality  rate,  and \nimmunization rates. Indonesia has the lowest physician density (number of physicians for every \n100,000 people), vis-\u00e0-vis its neighbors in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations region. \nThe  ratios  for  nurses  and  midwives  relative  to  the  population  are  higher  than  those  for \nphysicians, but the actual distribution varies greatly between regions. On the other hand, infant \nand child mortality rates do show some improvement since decentralization. The infant mortality \nrate fell from 60 per 1,000 live births in 2000 to 28 per 1,000 live births in 2005. Life expectancy \nhas also been improving, particularly in provinces that are relatively worse off like Papua, where \nlife expectancy improved from 62.7 years in 1996 to 67.3 years in 2005. \n4.  Infrastructure Expenditure and Services \n43.  Investment in public infrastructure has remained low since the financial crisis of the late \n1990s and is now (2006) around the pre-crisis level of about 7% of GDP, after declining from \n7% of GDP in 1996 to less than 3% in 2001. From 2000 to 2006 public investment by the central \nGovernment grew from 2.2% to 2.7% of GDP; among local governments the growth was more \nrapid, from 1.3% to 2.8% of GDP. Over this period provincial investment grew from 0.3% to \n1.0% of GDP. Household access to water, sanitation, and electricity in Indonesia is among the \nlowest in the region: only 18% of households have access to piped running water and there has \nbeen slow growth in the number of families with access to safe sanitation (18.2 million families \nin 2003 and 19.4 million in 2005). Many local water utility companies continue to be faced with \nfinancial problems following their transfer to local governments after decentralization, and while \nthere was a modest increase in PDAM customers of 11.4% over the period 2001\u20132005, the \nproportion of households with access to piped water actually fell from 19.7% in 2002 to 18.0% in \n2005. As shown in Table A5.5, there are wide regional differences in access to infrastructure \n(electricity, water, sealed roads). Access is closely related to the economic and financial wealth \nof regions and is generally low in the villages.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "  Appendix 5  67 \nTable A5.5: Village Access to Infrastructure, 2005 \n(% of villages in region) \n \nRegion  PLN Electricity  Piped Water Supply  Asphalt Roads \nSumatera  66    9  3 \nJava/Bali  73  12  1 \nNusa Tenggara  32    9  4 \nKalimantan  67  12  6 \nSulawesi  63  14  2 \nMaluku  55    9  5 \nPapua  38    3  7 \nPLN = Perusahaan Listrik Negara (the state electricity company). \nSource: World Bank, 2007 Public Expenditure Review. \n  5.  Service Delivery and Minimum Service Standards  \n44.  The  Ministry  of  Home  Affairs  (MOHA)  has  been  working  for  some  years  to  define \nminimum service standards (MSS) (generally understood as physical requirements) but has yet \nto produce a comprehensive set of MSS. However, government regulation 6/2007 specifies the \nprocess of preparing and issuing MSS. The goal of achieving a complete set of MSS is widely \nsupported; however, full issuance as envisioned presents major challenges. The main difficulty \nlies in making the standards feasible within the regional budgets when defined in physical terms, \nor making them possible when defined in terms of particular performance outcomes. There is \nalso the danger that physical standards may introduce distortions. A possible compromise \nwould be to adopt simplified minimum expenditure norms specified as expenditures per client or \nper capita on key obligatory functions. Other alternatives are being considered; among these \nare  the  \u201cbenchmarking\u201d  approach  used  in  some  countries,  which  is  consistent  with  the \nperformance information to be collected under the new government regulation 6/2008 on the \nevaluation of the performance of regional governments.  \nF.   Fiscal Decentralization and Poverty Reduction \n45.  The impact of decentralized governance on poverty is likely to be indirect, with many \nother forces affecting poverty trends. The poverty headcount ratio has dropped consistently \nsince the start of decentralization (from 23.4% in 1999 to 16.6% in 2007) but is still higher than it \nwas in the early 1990s (13.7% in 1993). Moreover, richer and poorer provinces have not \nimproved in the same way: poverty in poorer and mainly agricultural regions is still quite high. At \nthe extremes, 4.6% of the population in Jakarta and 40.8% in Papua were considered poor in \n2007. In 2002 the comparative extremes were 3.4% for Jakarta and 41.8% for Papua. \n \n46.  On  the  one  hand,  stronger  economic  growth  and  falling  inflation  have  provided  an \nessential underpinning for poverty reduction. On the other hand, large increases in the price of \nrice and other commodities that are major expenditures for the poor more than reversed the \ngains from economic growth in some periods. Those below the poverty line defined by the \nCentral Bureau of Statistics (Badan Pusat Statistik, or BPS) declined from 18.4% in 2001 to \n16.0% in 2005, but the rate went back up to 17.8% in 2006 because of significant increases in \nthe prices of rice and fuel. Inflation, which reached 15.7% in 2006 after the large fuel price \nadjustment, fell to 6.5% in 2007. This, together with the Government\u2019s compensatory conditional \ncash transfer program for the poor, helped reduce poverty to 16.6% in 2007.  \n \n47.  At the same time, inequality has been widening. As shown in Table A5.6, the Gini index \nhas increased consistently since 2001, suggesting that, despite declining poverty, growth has \nbeen  slower  among  the  lower-income  groups  than  among  the  higher-income  groups.  The \n ", "68  Appendix 5 \n \n \nincreasing inequality is also consistent with the declining pace of poverty reduction. On the \npolicy front, in an increasingly decentralized economy the effective implementation of fiscal \ndecentralization policy can play an important role in reducing poverty and income inequality. \n \nTable A5.6: Poverty, Inequality, and Regional Autonomy \n \nItem  2001  2004  2005  2006  2007  2008 \nPoverty (million) a             \nHeadcount, Rural  29.3  24.8  22.7  24.8  23.6  \u2014 \nHeadcount, Urban  8.6  11.4  12.4  14.5  13.6  \u2014 \nTotal  37.9  36.2  35.1  39.3  37.2  \u2014 \n(percentage of population)  18.4  16.7  16.0  17.8  16.6  \u2014 \nInequality a             \nGini Index  32.1  34.7  34.9  35.4  37.6  \u2014 \nRegional Equality b             \nCoefficient of Correlation between DAU and Poverty  \u2014  \u2014  0.84  0.8  0.79  0.78 \nCoefficient of Correlation between DAK and Poverty  \u2014  \u2014  (0.12)  0.15  0.09  0.15 \n\u2014 = not available. \na Central Bureau of Statistics (BPS). \nb Based on budget data for 2005\u20132008. \nSources: World Bank and Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n48.  With  significant  inequality  across  regions,  law  33/2004  on  fiscal  balance  put \nconsiderable emphasis on regional equalization. However, in the early years of implementation, \nefforts to address regional inequality were weakened by other political considerations. The main \ninstrument  for  achieving  the  equalization  objective  is  the  balancing  fund  and  its  largest \ncomponent is the DAU. The \u201chold harmless\u201d provision (before its removal in 2008) reduced \nregional fiscal equalization through the DAU. The second-largest component of the balancing \nfund is shared revenues for both tax and natural resources. Natural resource revenues are \nhighly concentrated in a small number of natural resource\u2013producing regions. The DAK is \nanother important component of the balancing fund, but so far there has been only weak \ncorrelation between its allocation and poverty (0.15 coefficient of correlation in 2008). Therefore, \nregional fiscal equalization relies heavily on the DAU, which is also highly correlated with the \npoverty headcount (0.78 coefficient of correlation in 2008). In addition to the balancing fund, the \ncentral  Government  implements  development  spending  with  deconcentrated  funds.  Recent \nstudies (World Bank, 2006) suggest that deconcentrated spending tends to benefit regions that \nare  already  fiscally  well  off.  In  2004,  deconcentrated  spending  per  capita  was  positively \ncorrelated with total fiscal revenue and, as a result, failed to contribute to fiscal equalization.  \nG.  Capacity Building for Public Financial Management \n49.  As  much  of  the  regulatory  framework  for  fiscal  decentralization  is  close  to  being \nfinalized, much attention is now being directed at ways to raise systems and human capacity. \nThe National Development Planning Agency (Badan Perencanaan Pembangunan Nasional, or \nBAPPENAS) is taking the lead in trying to improve planning methods and skills throughout \ngovernment and to link plans and policies more closely to budgets in a medium-term framework. \nBoth the Ministry of Finance (MOF) and MOHA are involved in efforts to disseminate the new \nbudgeting, reporting, and supervision requirements of the new regulatory regime, particularly in \nrelation to government regulations 58/2005 and 39/2007 and MOHA regulations 13/2006 and \n59/2007, which provide the framework for modern and consistent decentralized budget and \nfinancial management. For instance, in 2007 MOHA conducted specialized PFM courses for \nabout  100  central  government  officials  and  400  regional  government  officials.  MOF  also \nundertakes training for decentralized financial officials nationwide, mainly through the regional \nuniversities. In 2007, it conducted training in eight different locations for about 1,528 regional \n ", "  Appendix 5  69 \nofficials. Under subprogram 2 a considerably expanded scope for training and professional \ndevelopment of regional finance officials is planned, with commitments for considerably higher \nfunding than in recent times from both MOHA and MOF.  \n \n50.  Additionally, MOF and MOHA with funding from the LGFGR 1 project loan are involved \nin the development of new computerized financial management information systems (FMIS) to \nsupport  planning,  budgeting,  budget  execution,  reporting,  and  auditing  in  171  regional \ngovernments  to start with,  and  possibly  other  regional  governments  later  on. About  9,642 \nregional  government  finance  and  management  officials  will  be  trained  in  this  major \ncapacity-building  project.  Moreover,  the  Sustainable  Capacity  Building  for  Decentralization \n(SCBD) project funded by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) continues to provide some 40 \nparticipating regional governments with general management training and support. Because \nthese two ADB project loans are both still disbursing, the Government has decided not to \npursue a further project loan under subprogram 1 of LGFGR 2. But the possibility of such a loan \nunder subprogram 2 has not been ruled out, especially if the current project support continues \nto make good progress. Other development partners with involvement in fiscal decentralization \nmatters are directing most of their efforts at capacity building in one form or another (systems, \nhuman resources, etc.) in regional governments, in some cases (with ADB support) through the \nleadership of MOF, MOHA, and BPK (see Appendix 4). Improving capacity for decentralized \nplanning, budgeting and financial management remains a core focus of subprograms 1 and 2 \nand will require the application of considerable resources from all levels of government and \ndevelopment partners over an extended period of time. Under Indonesia\u2019s capacity-building \nframework, central ministries and agencies must provide leadership and facilitation but the \nregional  governments  themselves  must  take  ultimate  responsibility  for  improving  their  own \ncapacity. There is still scope for development partners to support both centrally led efforts but \nalso  increasingly  to  engage  directly  with  individual  regional  governments  or  groups  of \ngovernments. \n \n ", "70  Appendix 6 \n \nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY  \n \nIndonesia: Second Local Government Finance and Governance Reform Program Cluster (LGFGR 2) \n \nSoutheast Asia Department \nDepartment/ \nProgram Loan  Policy-Based  Governance, Finance, and \nDivision: \nTrade Division \n       \nI.  POVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA. Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \nThe Government\u2019s medium-term development plan (Rencana Pembangunan Jangka Menengah, or RPJM) looks forward to \nhalving the percentage of those below the poverty line to 8.2% by 2009 through programs to improve food security, water \nsupply and sanitation, access to basic health and education services, and shelter. The RPJM also projects an increase in \nschool enrollment rates, especially in the 9-year mandatory basic education program, to over 99% in 2009, with improvements \nin the quality of education. It projects a significant increase in enrollment in secondary and tertiary education as well, and a \nreduction in illiteracy to 5%. At the same time, income inequality has increased over time, suggesting that the cost of reducing \npoverty  may  have  increased.  Addressing  poverty  reduction  Indirectly,  the  Second  Local  Government  Finance  and \nGovernance Reform Program (LGFGR 2)  will help the regional governments deliver basic public services more efficiently and \neffectively to their constituents by making the release of fiscal transfers and shared revenues more equitable, predictable, and \ntransparent. LGFGR 2 also supports improvements in service delivery mechanisms through the provision of financing and \nperformance monitoring. In addition, it will strengthen the capacity of regional governments to generate their own revenues, \nand improve accountability. Support for the implementation of fiscal decentralization reforms will further contribute indirectly to \npoverty reduction by improving the investment climate and reducing bottlenecks in regional infrastructure development. There \nwill also be short-term employment generation through enhanced programs of public works. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                  Targeting Classification:  General intervention \n1. Key Issues  \n \nBetter economic growth over the last 5 years has raised living standards and reduced the poverty headcount ratio in \nIndonesia. But, given the persistence of poverty in the last 5 years, the RPJM poverty target is unlikely to be met. The \nincrease in income inequality over time also suggests that it may cost more to reduce poverty. With the country so \ngeographically diverse, reducing poverty requires different strategies and efforts in different regions. Per capita income in the \nrichest province is more than 20 times that of the poorest province. Poverty indicators also show large regional disparities: \npoverty incidence is lowest in Jakarta (4.6%) and highest (40%) in Papua. Access to opportunities is far from equal, as shown \nin the table below. The poor at the bottom rungs of income distribution have fewer job opportunities than the nonpoor. While \nthe health insurance program for the poor (Askeskin) has given the poor easier access to basic health services, better health \nservices largely benefit those at the top end of the income distribution scale. Basic infrastructure services, particularly \nelectricity and clean drinking water, are not equally shared. \n \nC. Poverty Impact Analysis for Policy-Based Lending  \nDecentralization  has  been  advocated  as  an  important  policy  tool  to  broaden  citizen  participation  and  improve  local \ngovernance, making regional governments more responsive and more likely to develop policies and programs that meet local \nneeds.  Bottom-up  poverty  reduction  is  thereby  promoted.  International  experiencea  suggests  that  the  link  between \ndecentralization and poverty reduction is not always clear. In some of the poorest countries characterized by weak institutions \nand political conflicts, decentralization may actually worsen matters. The poverty impact of decentralization appears to \ndepend less on the physical country setting, for example, a country\u2019s size or quality of infrastructure, than on the capacity and \nwillingness of policy makers to ensure pro-poor devolution. If the central Government lacks the capacity to fulfill its basic \nfunctions, decentralization could be counterproductive. However, if the central Government provides the necessary leadership \nand is committed to devolving power to lower tiers of government, decentralization could be a powerful tool for poverty \nreduction, better representation for the poor, and better targeting of service delivery.  \n \nOverall, poverty in Indonesia has declined only moderately in the past few years (see table). Factors affecting the poverty \nincidence are complex. At the macro level, stronger economic growth and falling inflation in the past few years have provided \nessential underpinning for poverty reduction. At a more micro level, large increases in the prices of rice and other \ncommodities that are major items of expenditure in the budget of the poor have at times more than reversed the poverty gains \nfrom economic growth. The number of people living below the poverty line declined from 36.2 million in 2004 to 35.1 million in \n2005. But higher inflation and a significant increase in the prices of rice and fuel reversed the trend in 2006. Falling inflation, \ntogether with the Government\u2019s conditional cash transfer program for the poor designed as compensation for the fuel price \nincreases, helped bring overall poverty back toward 2004 levels in 2007. However, poverty incidence in the urban areas \nincreased during the same period.  \n ", "Appendix 6  71 \n \nPoverty, Inequality, and Regional Autonomy \n \nItem  2001  2004  2005  2006  2007  2008 \nPoverty (million) a             \nHeadcount, Rural  29.3  24.8  22.7  24.8  23.6  \u2014 \nHeadcount, Urban  8.6  11.4  12.4  14.5  13.6  \u2014 \nTotal  37.9  36.2  35.1  39.3  37.2  \u2014 \n(percentage of population)  18.4  16.7  16.0  17.8  16.6  \u2014 \nInequality a             \nGini Index  32.1  34.7  34.9  35.4  37.6  \u2014 \nRegional Equality b             \nCoefficient of Correlation between DAU and Poverty  \u2014  \u2014  0.84  0.8  0.79  0.78 \nCoefficient of Correlation between DAK and Poverty  \u2014  \u2014  (0.12)  0.15  0.09  0.15 \n\u2014 = not available, DAK = specific allocation fund, DAU = general allocation fund. \na Central Bureau of Statistics (BPS). \nb Based on budget data for 2005\u20132008. \nSources: World Bank and Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nDecentralization has significantly increased the fiscal resources transferred to the regions. The largest transfer is the general \nallocation fund (Dana Alokasi Umum, or DAU), which accounts for about for about 62% of local government revenues and \n20% of provincial government revenues. Regional fiscal equalization relies heavily on the DAU and its allocation appears to \nbe highly correlated with the poverty headcount ratio. However, poverty reduction across regions is very uneven. In 2002\u2013\n2007, poverty reduction in most provinces was moderate to significant. Despite large transfers from the central Government, \npoverty in the one of the poorest provinces (Papua) was stagnant during the period, whereas poverty in Jakarta increased \nfrom 3.4% in 2004 to 4.6% in 2007.  \n \nII.

Purpose and Background \n1.  The purpose of the technical assistance (TA) is twofold: (i) to support the Government in \nbuilding institutional capacity in the development and implementation of a medium-term reform \nagenda in regional government financing and governance, and (ii) to facilitate the achievement \nof delivery targets and commitments in subprogram 2 of the Second Local Government Finance \nand Governance Reform (LGFGR 2) policy matrix. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has \nbeen actively supporting, through many TA projects, the implementation of related regional \ngovernment  reforms  in  capacity  development,  local  government  financing,  public  financial \nmanagement, service delivery, performance measurement, and other areas. This TA will help fill \nthe remaining gaps and will be specifically targeted at medium-term reform areas. \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n2.  The TA will strive to enhance management and coordination in the implementation of \nfiscal decentralization, improve the intergovernmental fiscal system, develop better incentive \nsystems for service delivery, and reduce regional governments\u2019 dependency on fiscal transfers. \nThe  expected  outcome  is  improved  delivery  of  services  for  the  general  welfare  of  the \ncommunities and enhanced accountability of regional governments.  \nC.  Outputs \n3.  National  Action  Plan  for  Fiscal  Decentralization  (NAPFD)  2010\u20132014.  This  will \nprovide a strong legal and management framework for the long-term implementation of fiscal \ndecentralization  and  ensure  effective  continuation  of  the  decentralization  agenda.  This \ncomponent will include the following activities:  \n \n(i)  supporting  the  National  Development  Planning  Agency  (Badan  Perencanaan \nPembangunan  Nasional,  or  BAPPENAS)  in  developing  NAPFD  2010\u20132014, \nsetting out the Government\u2019s objectives, strategies, and policy actions in fiscal \ndecentralization over the next 5-year development period. This activity will be \ncoordinated closely with that of the advisory team that is now developing the draft \nof a grand strategy for fiscal decentralization under the leadership of the Ministry \nof Finance (MOF); \n(ii)  assisting  BAPPENAS  in  conducting  background  studies  in  cooperation  with \nnational reputable research institutions to support the preparation of the NAPFD; \n(iii)  supporting the conduct of seminars for key stakeholders from the central and \nregional governments to discuss the NAPFD draft; and \n(iv)  supporting BAPPENAS in developing the national medium-term development plan \n(Rencana Pembangunan Jangka Menengah, or RPJM) 2010\u20132014 in the area of \nfiscal decentralization, with the help of outputs developed under NAPFD. \n \n4.  Fiscal Decentralization Modeling and Database in MOF. This component will enhance \nthe equalizing effects of the general allocation fund (Dana Alokasi Umum, or DAU) and introduce \nincentives to reduce the regional governments\u2019 wage bill, thereby freeing up more resources for \nhigher-priority spending. This component will involve the following activities: \n \n ", "Appendix 8  75 \n(i)  reviewing the model now used to allocate DAU and the database used to support \nthe calibration of the model; \n(ii)  reviewing the definition of fiscal capacity and expenditure needs used to compute \nthe fiscal gap And, as better data become available, identifying the possibility of \nfurther refining the measurement of if fiscal capacity and expenditure needs to \nreflect regional disparities; \n(iii)  developing  a  new  model  and  conducting  simulations  to  identify  options  and \neffects of delinking the regional government wage bill from DAU allocations; \n(iv)  assisting MOF in conducting analytical studies on the regional government wage \nbill in cooperation with a reputable national institution; and \n(v)  facilitating dialogue among fiscal decentralization experts on the options identified \nand developing a strategy for securing buy-in from various stakeholders.  \n \n5.  Forward Estimates for Major Transfers and Implementation. The activities in this \ncomponent will reduce uncertainties in future transfers and shared revenue and facilitate the \nintroduction of a medium-term expenditure framework (MTEF) at the regional level as stated in \nthe 2008 budget. The central Government introduced MTEF in 2008. The following activities will \nbe undertaken in this component: \n \n(i)  supporting MOF in designing forward estimates for major transfers and other large \nshared revenue flows and incorporating these estimates into budget documents; \nand \n(ii)  supporting MOF in developing projections of variables affecting DAU allocations \nand shared revenue flows. \n \n6.  DAK Design and Monitoring. The activities in this component will improve the allocation \nof the general allocation fund (Dana Alokasi Khusus, or DAK) as it will be based on clear \nprinciples and a smaller set of objectives. Over the medium term, the new DAK design and \nmonitoring mechanism will address concerns about the diluted impact of DAK, as the fund is \nbeing used in a growing number of sectors by an increasing number of regional governments. \nThis component will involve the following activities: \n \n(i)  supporting MOF in updating and preparing DAK guidelines to improve the impact \nof the fund in achieving national priorities; identifying the most desirable way of \nincorporating  an  element  of  regional  government  performance  in  allocation \nformulas; \n(ii)  assisting MOF in strengthening the DAK monitoring and evaluation system and \nprepare its operational framework; \n(iii)  supporting MOF in preparing the required government or MOF regulations and \ndisseminating these to the regions; and \n(iv)  supporting the implementation of the operational framework for DAK and training \nstakeholders in its use.  \n \n7.  Pilot-Testing  of  Incentive-  and  Sanction-Linked  Transfers.  This  component  will \nimprove the central Government\u2019s ability to enforce appropriate intergovernmental mechanisms, \nsupport the enhancement of regional government capacity, and strengthen local governance. \nIncentive- and sanction-linked transfers will provide an efficient mechanism for promoting the \nregional governments\u2019 participation in achieving national development priorities and in speeding \nup decentralization reforms. This component will have the following activities: \n \n ", "76  Appendix 8 \n \n(i)  supporting MOF in finalizing the policy design for incentives and sanctions for \ntransfers based on the MOF policy paper completed under subprogram 1 of \nLGFGR 2; \n(ii)  assisting  MOF  in  developing  guidelines  and  implementing  procedures  for \nfurthering the introduction of incentive- and sanction-based transfers on a pilot \nbasis; and \n(iii)  supporting  further  studies  and  facilitating  consultations  and  training  of \nstakeholders to implement and roll out the system of incentives and sanctions. \n \n8.   Devolution of Property Tax to the Regions. This will improve the revenue autonomy of \nregional  governments  and  make  them  less  dependent  on  fiscal  transfers  from  the  central \nGovernment. This component will entail the following activities: \n \n(i)  supporting MOF in disseminating the amendments to law 34/2000 (on regional \ntaxes  and  charges)  and  facilitating  discussion  on  the  design  for  the  gradual \ndevolution of the property tax; \n(ii)  assisting MOF in developing guidelines for the decentralization of the property tax; \nand \n(iii)  supporting MOF during the early stages of devolution of the property tax with \nmonitoring and training and required studies. \n \n9.   Planning  for  Decentralized  Capacity  Building.

The \ninternational consultants will work closely with national consultants (80 person-months) with \nsimilar  backgrounds.  Reputable  national  research  institutes  will  be  recruited  to  conduct \nbackground studies for the preparation of the NAPFD and wage bills of regional governments. \nNine  consultants,  including  the  international  team  leader  (total  of  12  international  and  80 \nnational person-months), will be hired through a reputable international consulting firm after the \nfull  technical  proposals  undergo  quality-  and  cost-based  selection.  Two  international \nconsultants\u2014the fiscal decentralization adviser and the DAK design and property tax adviser (6 \nperson-months in total)\u2014will be hired individually, as the distinct areas of expertise involved \nmay not be available through a single firm. All recruitment and hiring will conform to ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time).  \n \n13.
