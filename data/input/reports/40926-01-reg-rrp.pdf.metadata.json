The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  shall  not  be  the \nsingle largest investor in the Fund. \n \n\nII. \n\nINVESTMENT RATIONALE AND DEVELOPMENT IMPACT \n\n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION HAS BEEN DELETED] \n \n\nA. \n\nBackground \n\n1. \n\nMore Steady Economic Growth \n\n2. \nOver  the  past  5  years,  Pacific  island  economies  have  improved  after  times  of  severe \npolitical  instability  in  Papua  New  Guinea  (PNG),  Fiji  Islands,  and  Solomon  Islands;  and  the \nglobal  economic  downturn  in  2002\u20132003.  Real  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  growth  in  the \nregion  averaged  2.1%  over  1999\u20132003,  notwithstanding  prolonged  contractions  in  the \neconomies of PNG, Solomon Islands, and Vanuatu. Consumer price inflation was also kept in \ncheck  between  1999  and  2003,  averaging  4.6%,  even  though  inflation  in  some  economies \nremained or accelerated into double digits.   \n \n3. \nfactors, including the following. \n \n\nThe  combination  of  moderate  inflation  and  steady  growth  is  attributable  to  various \n\nNormalization of political and economic activity following the coup d\u2019\u00e9tat in the Fiji \nIslands, and rapid reconstruction following the collapse of political institutions and \nthe  economy  in  the  Solomon  Islands.  However,  recent  riots  in  the  Solomon \nIslands show the continuing vulnerability.  \n\nImproving  economic  and  political  conditions  in  PNG  following  the  enhanced \nengagement  of  multilateral  development  institutions  and  the  Government  of \nAustralia. \n\nGradual  improvements  in  fiscal  discipline  in  some  countries  and  an  increased \nfocus on the quality of public expenditure and rationalization of the public sector \nin those countries.  \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nRobust  recovery  in  world  commodity  and  cash  crop  prices,  boosting  export \nrevenues for minerals, timber, palm oil, copra, cocoa, vanilla, and squash.  \n\n \n4. \nAlthough  the  investment  climate  in  the  Pacific  islands  will  remain  challenging  for  the \nforeseeable  future,  gradual  improvements  in  the  economic  and  political  landscape  of  many \ncountries  in  the  region  is  expected  to  create  opportunities  for  investors.  In  the  two  largest \neconomies, PNG and Fiji Islands, economic growth will be underpinned by strong foreign direct \ninvestment inflows in the mining, energy, and tourism sectors. Growth prospects in the smaller \neconomies  will  largely  depend  on  agricultural  performance  and  the  development  of  niche \nsubsectors, such as organic farming and ecotourism, in addition to more general tourism.  \n \n\n2. \n\nShortage of Risk Capital for Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises (SMEs)   \n\n5. \nIn  order  to  exploit  the  opportunities  generated  by  these  broadly  stable  economic \nconditions,  many  SMEs  in  the  Pacific  islands  require  medium-to-long-term  capital  financing. \nHowever,  SMEs  throughout  the  region  are  constrained  by  low  turnover,  rudimentary \nadministrative and managerial practices, and an acute shortage of risk capital.  \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n6. \nIn the Pacific region, the commercial banking sector is almost exclusively dominated by \ntwo  Australian  institutions,  ANZ  Bank  and  Westpac.  Commercial  banks  largely  focus  on  the \nretail  sector  through  basic  deposit-taking  and  lending  activities  and  on  the  few  large  project \nfinance  opportunities  that  arise.  Domestic  financial  sectors  provide  only  a  minimal  range  of \nbanking  services;  access  to  credit  for  local  entrepreneurs  is  limited;  and  high  interest  rate \nspreads  reflect  high  transaction  costs  and  risk  premiums,  and  inefficiencies  in  financial \nintermediation.  There  has  been  little  appetite  to  complement  lucrative  retail  finance  products \nwith  higher-risk  unsecured  commercial  loan  products.  SMEs  struggle  to  qualify  for  traditional \ndebt  financing  because  few  have  adequate  collateral  required  to  meet  commercial  banks\u2019 \nstringent lending criteria in the context of an ineffective legal and technical collateral framework.  \n \nPNG and the Fiji Islands are the two major countries in the Fund\u2019s investment region and \n7. \nthe majority of the Fund\u2019s capital will be invested in these two countries. In PNG, bank lending \nto  the  private  sector  has  remained  stagnant  since  the  early  1990s,  although  it  has  increased \nsomewhat in the last 1\u20132 years.1 The credit policies of the formal financial sector are cautious. \nThe banks favor larger clients (many of which are subsidiaries of foreign firms) and short-term \ninvestments,  particularly  in  the  form  of  government  securities.  At  the  end  of  2004,  short-term \ngovernment securities constituted 40% of the asset base of commercial banks. Bank lending is \nfurther hindered by the difficulties of land registration and low population density, which increase \ntransaction costs and security concerns.  \n \n8. \nIn the Fiji Islands, the capital markets are underdeveloped, even though they are deeper \nthan those of any of the other Pacific region\u2019s economies. The South Pacific Stock Exchange in \nSuva,  Fiji  Islands,  is  the  only  stock  exchange  of  note  in  the  region.  There  are  a  number  of \nissues  hampering  the  financial  sector\u2019s  ability  to  finance  investment  and  encourage  savings, \nsuch as high interest rate spreads; poor intermediation of remittances; and low levels of credit to \nthe  private  sector,  which  only  amounts  to  about  23%  of  GDP.2  In  addition,  lack  of  adequate \ncollateral  for  securing  loans  and  the  inability  of  native  landowners  to  mortgage  their  land \nbecause of customary tenure hinders financial intermediation and SMEs\u2019 access to credit.  \n \n9. \nWhen commercial banks lend to SMEs, they often take equity risk for a debt-like return \nbecause  of  the  absence  of  acceptable  collateral.  There  are  no  providers  of  capital  to \ncomplement the provision of financing with value-addition; managerial mentoring; and strategic \ndecision-making, which is needed to mitigate risks and obtain risk-adjusted returns from equity \nfinance, in particular in a market with little managerial and operational sophistication. The result \nis  that  there  are  few  and,  in  some  cases,  no  sources  of  risk  capital  available  to  SMEs  in  the \nregion.  \n \nB. \nChallenges and Opportunities  \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION HAS BEEN DELETED] \n \n\n1. \n\nBuilding on Investment Experience in the Pacific Islands  \n\n10. \nGiven  the  overall  lack  of  risk  capital,  and  the  past  investment  experience  of  Pacific \nCapital Partners Limited (the Fund Manager) gained by investing and divesting Kula Fund I, the \nproposed Fund will be well placed to take advantage of some of the more attractive investment \nopportunities in the marketplace. The Fund plans to invest in the types of companies that could \nbenefit  significantly  from  the  hands-on  involvement  and  guidance  that  the  Fund  Manager  can \nprovide.  The  Fund  Manager  will  build  on  its  lessons  learned  in  SME  investment  in  the  Pacific \n                                                 \n1 Economist Intelligence Unit. 2005. Country Report. Papua New Guinea. London. \n2 ADB. 2006. Private Sector Assessment for Fiji Islands. Manila.  \n\n\f \n\n \n\n3\n\nislands  to  actively  assist  investee  companies  in  developing  business  plans,  improving  capital \nstructures,  and  implementing  international  standards  of  corporate  governance.  Hands-on \nassistance  will  also  be  provided  in  improving  management  information  systems  and  human \nresource  development,  which  will  help  to  produce  solid  returns  to  investors  while  providing \ninvestee companies with a strong foundation for sustainable growth and development. In many \ncases,  the  transition  to  more  professional  management  should  enable  portfolio  companies  to \nimprove their performance and enhance their value to potential purchasers, thus improving the \nFund\u2019s chances of achieving profitable exits. \n \n11. \nA key feature of the proposed Fund is that it will be able to mobilize the relationships it \nhas  established  in  the  Pacific  region  since  1997  to  generate  investment  opportunities.  With \nteam members already located in the Pacific region, the Fund Manager has begun to generate \na pipeline of potential transactions for the Fund, mobilizing its long-standing network of contacts \nwith senior corporate executives, financial intermediaries, and service providers, such as legal \nand  accounting  professionals.  Potential  investment  opportunities  for  the  Fund  have  arisen  in \nagribusiness,  tourism,  fast-moving  consumer  goods,  manufacturing,  and  business-process \noutsourcing.  The  Fund  will  be  able  to  immediately  pursue  a  number  of  these  potential \nopportunities  after  its  establishment,  which  will  minimize  the  period  where  the  Fund  pays \nmanagement  fees  without  generating  returns  from  investments.  This  is  crucial  for  achieving  a \npositive net return in this challenging environment.  \n \nC. \n \n\nDevelopment Impact  \n\n1. \n\nDevelopment Objectives  \n\n \n12. \nThe Fund will build on Kula Fund I\u2019s experience and role in contributing to private sector \ndevelopment in the Pacific region. The three case studies show the important contributions that \nKula  Fund  I  made  in  (i)  improving  access  to  finance,  (ii)  private-sector-led  development,  (iii) \nintroducing  best  practices  in  corporate  governance,  (iv)  generating  employment,  (v)  providing \nbasic services such as access to health care and education, and (vi) at a more overarching level, \nimproving living standards through poverty reduction of investee companies\u2019 employees.  \n \n13. \ndevelopmental objectives. \n \n\nSpecifically, by providing financing for Kula Fund II, ADB intends to achieve the following \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\nCapacity building in a narrow financial sector. The establishment of regional \noffices and cooperation with financial professionals in remote islands will help to \nfoster  local  SME  investment  skills.  The  Aureos  investment  philosophy  and \ninfrastructure  are  particularly  effective  because  they  combine  decentralized \ndecision-making  and  active  support, \nfrom \nheadquarters.  \n\ntraining,  and  quality  control \n\nDiversify sources of finance available for SMEs. Given the stringent collateral \nrequirements of banks in the Pacific islands, the inclusion of equity finance will be \ncritically  important.  It  enables  SMEs  to  buy  fixed  assets,  use  them  as  collateral \nfor  commercial  bank  loans,  and  leverage  their  expansion.  This  leverage  effect \ncreates  a  dynamic  process  promoting  SMEs\u2019  graduation  to  larger  enterprises, \nwhich results in increased employment and productivity. \n\n(iii) \n\nBuilding  sustainable  private  sector  companies.  The  Fund  Manager  will \ncontribute  to  the  development  of  sustainable  SMEs  by  providing  management \nadvice  to  SMEs  in  financial  planning,  business  expansion  strategies,  human \n\n \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n \n\nresource  development,  and \ncorporate governance. \n\nimplementation  of \n\ninternational  standards  of \n\nCreate sustainable private sector jobs. Sustainable employment in the Pacific \nislands will be created through the Fund\u2019s investee companies. \n\nSupport  a  fund  manager  with  a  track  record  in  the  Pacific  islands.  By \nmanaging Kula Fund I, the investment team has gained critically important local \ninvestment experience and created a network in the Pacific islands, which can be \nused to source investments and build sustainable SMEs in the region.  \n\n \n14. \nIn addition to the Fund\u2019s direct impact on employment and economic growth, the Fund \nwill  contribute  to  the  development  of  effective  regulatory  and  legal  environments  in  the  target \ncountries. The Fund will be required to collect consistent information on regulatory issues that \ntheir SME portfolio companies encounter in the Pacific region. This information will be reported \non a regular basis to PARD to support the formulation of a regulatory framework conducive to \nentrepreneurial SMEs.     \n \nD. \n\nMeasuring Development Effectiveness \n\nADB\u2019s  Private  Sector  Operations  Department  (PSOD)  and  Operations  Evaluation \n15. \nDepartment (OED) continue to formulate guidelines for implementing Good Practice Standards \n(GPS)  for  Evaluation  of  Private  Sector  Investment  Operations,  which  were  prepared  by  the \nEvaluation  Cooperation  Group3  of  the  multilateral  development  banks.  These  GPS  cover  the \nroles  of  the  independent  evaluation  department  and  the  private  sector  department  itself,  the \nevaluation  dimensions  for  private  sector  operations,  the  nature  of  annual  reporting,  and \ndissemination of reports and lessons. According to the GPS, the three principal dimensions for \nprivate  sector  evaluation  are  (i)  development  outcome,  (ii)  investment  profitability  for  the \ninstitution,  and  (iii)  operational  effectiveness.  PSOD  will  measure  the  expected  development \noutcome  of  this  Fund  at  the  fund  and  sub-project  levels,  as  well  as  beyond  the  Fund,  by \nmonitoring  certain  performance  measures  throughout  the  life  of  the  Fund.  The  performance \nmeasures are grouped into three key areas.  \n\n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\nBusiness  performance.  The  extent  to  which  the  Fund  has  reached  its \nobjectives in terms of the overall profitability and commercial viability of the Fund \nand subprojects. \n\nEconomic sustainability. The effects of the Fund and subprojects on the DMC\u2019s \neconomy, and the associated benefits and costs. On one hand, these measures \nassess  the  extent  to  which  the  Fund  improved  the  allocation  of  resources  and \nprovision  of  financial  services  to  viable  private  enterprises.  On  the  other,  these \nmeasures evaluate whether the subprojects directly generated positive effects on \nthe local economy.  \n\nPrivate  sector  development.  The  impact  of  the  Fund  on  private  sector \ndevelopment  beyond  the  Fund  itself  and  its  immediate  stakeholders,  e.g.,  the \nFund\u2019s  contribution  to  the  growth  of  viable  financial  institutions  and  financial \nmarkets development. \n\n \n                                                 \n3 The Evaluation Cooperation Group was formed by the multilateral development banks to design common evaluation \nstandards for private sector operations. The group\u2019s  work is ongoing and some aspects of the present evaluation \nframework might change to correspond to best practices. \n\n\f \n\n5\n\nIII. \n\nTHE FUND \n\n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION HAS BEEN DELETED] \n \n\nFund Objectives  \n\nA. \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION HAS BEEN DELETED] \n \n16. \nKula  Fund  II  will  invest  in  SMEs  in  the  Pacific  islands.  At  least  80%  of  the  Fund\u2019s \ninvestments  will  be  invested  in  enterprises  in  the  Cook  Islands,  Fiji  Islands,  Kiribati,  Marshall \nIslands, Federated States of Micronesia, Nauru, PNG, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu, \nPalau, and Vanuatu. The remaining 20% may be invested in enterprises based elsewhere in the \nPacific  region, 4   which  have,  or  are  expected  to  have,  significant  operations  and/or  create \neconomic benefit within DMCs of the Pacific region. While a significant proportion of committed \ncapital is expected to be invested in PNG and the Fiji Islands, the Fund\u2019s overarching objective \nis  to  build  a  portfolio  diversified  by  geography,  and  no  more  than  60%  of  the  Fund\u2019s  total \ncommitments can be invested in enterprises in the Fiji Islands and PNG. \n \nThe  Fund  will  generally  take  significant  minority  stakes  with  board  representation  and \n17. \nthe right to participate in or influence the conduct of management in its portfolio companies. The \nsize of the Fund\u2019s investment in portfolio companies will range from $100,000 to $3 million. The \nFund will pursue the following investment opportunities: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nexpansions  of  companies  with  promising  growth  prospects  that  are  unable  to \nsecure financing from traditional sources such as commercial banks; \n\nconsolidations  and  associated  divestments  of  discrete  business  segments  as \nconglomerates refocus on core competences; \n\nmanagement  buyouts,  as  local  managers  seek  to  take  control  of  recently-\ndivested or newly-privatized companies; \n\nstart-ups  and  early  stage  transactions,  particularly  in  smaller  Pacific  islands, \nwhere local managers are able demonstrate a sound track record;  \n\ngrowth  in  agricultural  output  and  exports  in  response  to  improved  world \ncommodity  prices  and  the  implementation  of  agricultural  development  policies \nfocusing on niche agriculture, organic and specialty products; and \n\nstrong  growth  in  the  tourism  sector  underpinned  by  a  perception,  particularly \namong  Australian  and  New  Zealand  holiday-makers,  that  terrorist  attacks  are \nless likely in Pacific island destinations than in other regions. \n\nFund Management  \n\n \n18. \nThe Fund\u2019s equity commitments may be accompanied by secured debt, mezzanine debt, \nand/or  quasi-equity  instruments  such  as  convertible  debt  and  preference  shares.  Such \ninvestment structures offer current income and mitigate the risks related to exiting from portfolio \ncompanies in this challenging environment.  \n \nB. \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION HAS BEEN DELETED] \n \n19. \nFund Manager. The Fund will be managed by Pacific Capital Partners Limited (the Fund \nManager),  a  company  with  limited  liability  and  incorporated  under  the  laws  of  Vanuatu,  and  a \nwholly-owned  subsidiary  of  Aureos  Capital  Limited  (Aureos),  a  company  incorporated  with \nlimited  liability  under  the  laws  of  Mauritius.  Aureos  is  a  global  manager  of  SME  private  equity \n                                                \n \n4 Including Australia and New Zealand.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\n \n\nfunds.  Aureos  was  born  out  of  the  former  Commonwealth  Development  Capital  (CDC)  Funds \nGroup, pioneers of private equity in many of the emerging markets in the SME sector. (CDC\u2019s \nfirst  fund,  which  was  established  in  1989,  and  all  its  subsequent  funds,  were  exclusively \ninvested in developing countries.) When CDC spun out its private equity funds business in July \n2001, Aureos was established as a fund manager. Over 10 management companies, originally \nowned and managed by CDC, which in turn managed 14 SME venture capital country-specific \nfunds, were consolidated under the Aureos umbrella.   \n \nHeadquarters.  The  Aureos headquarters is in London and focuses solely on operating \n20. \nSME funds around the world. Aureos combines local presence with a global network, whereby \nthe central team fulfills the following functions:  \n \n\ncentral reporting function ensuring consistency, quality, and timeliness; \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\ncross-fertilization  between  regional  teams  on  global  investment  themes,  and \nindustry-specific and market information; \n\ncompliance and procedural quality control; \n\noverseeing  the  collection  and  implementation  of  lessons  learned  by  providing  a \ncentral point of information dissemination; \n\ntraining  and  dissemination  of  best  practices  in  investment  management  and \ncorporate governance; \n\n(vi) \n\nexit assistance, particularly in finding foreign partners; and \n\n(vii) \n\ncash control supervision. \n\n \n21. \nLocal Team. The local team carries out the main responsibilities of identifying potential \ninvestee companies, executing transactions, and monitoring and managing portfolio companies. \nThis local decision-making process is reflected in the Fund\u2019s incentive structure, which allocates \nmost of the performance-related rewards (carried interest) to the local team. The track record of \nAureos shows that its structure optimizes capacity building of local SME investment skills as it \ncombines  decentralized  decision  making  with  active  support  and  quality  control  from \nheadquarters. \n \n22. \nSoon after the first closing, the Fund Manager will establish a new representative office \nin Suva, Fiji Islands, while maintaining its existing offices in Port Moresby, PNG, and Brisbane, \nAustralia\u2014which  will  be  the  regional  hub  office.  Back-office  support  will  be  provided  from \nBrisbane to produce standardized reporting and other management support so that investment \npartners can focus exclusively on investing and managing the Fund  \n \n23. \nTechnical  Assistance.  Taking  from  lessons  learned  (investing  in  the  Pacific  region  is \ncostly and highly human resource intensive), Kula Fund II will have the benefit of TA funds from \nthe Australian Agency for International Development (AusAID), New Zealand\u2019s International Aid \n&  Development  Agency  (NZAID),  Australian  Business  Volunteers,  and  Centre  for  the \nDevelopment  of  Enterprise  of  the  European  Union.  AusAID  and  NZAID  have  committed \n$150,000  each  per  annum.  TA  support  will  take  the  form  of  capacity  building,  training,  export \ndevelopment, and support in the due diligence process. By means of TA funding, the Fund will \nestablish  partnerships  with \nlocal  business  councils,  chambers  of  commerce,  export \ndevelopment  agencies,  and  other  relevant  organizations  to  increase  awareness  among  local \nentrepreneurs of the benefits of risk capital as an asset class and to encourage them to grow \ntheir  businesses  through  partnership.
