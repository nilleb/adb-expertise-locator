Tuvalu is one of the smallest and most remote ADB member countries. \nIts  challenges  in transport  and  economic  development  come from  its  dispersed  geography:  (i) \nnine atoll islands, stretching across more than 680 kilometers (km) in the southwest Pacific; (ii) a \nsmall  and  dispersed  population  of  10,100  as  of  June  2016,  with  more  than  6,000  people  in \nFunafuti, the capital, and the rest on the outer islands;3 and (iii) a decreasing population on the \nouter islands because of limited economic opportunities. Tuvalu is more than 1,100 km away from \nFiji and more than 3,000 km away from Australia and New Zealand. \n \n4. \nMaritime transport challenges. The Government of Tuvalu runs  a shipping service to \nfacilitate passenger and cargo mobility between the islands, which faces numerous challenges. \nFirst,  the  two  ships  operating  continuously  can  only  reach  each  the  islands  once  every  2\u20133 \nweeks.4  Second,  no  outer  island  has  a  docking  facility  for  the  government  ships,  and  small \nworkboats ferry passengers and cargo between the ship and the shore. This is dangerous when \nthe sea is rough. Third, workboats need to pass through channels, some of which are dangerous \nwhen  the  sea  is  rough  or  too  shallow  to  use  during  low  tide.  Finally,  except  for  Nanumea, \nNukufetau,  and  Vaitupu,  the  outer  islands  also  lack  docking facilities for  the  workboats.  In  the \npast, serious accidents have occurred during both passenger transfers and navigation through \nthe channels, resulting in loss of lives and economic values. Transfer operations cannot be carried \nout when the sea is rough or after dark, reducing the efficiency of ship operations. In addition, \nTuvalu faces constant and increasing threats of natural hazards such as tropical cyclones. \n \n5. \nGovernment priority. The government places very high priority on improving access for \nthe outer islands. The National Strategy for Sustainable Development, 2016\u20132020 sets out the \ngovernment\u2019s vision to make maritime transportation more efficient and safer.5 The original project \nincluded the construction of a small work-boat harbour in the island of Nukulaelae and some minor \nmaritime  infrastructure  improvements  (construction  of  boat  ramps)  in  the  islands  of  Nui  and \n\n                                                \n1  The construction of a small workboat harbor is a new activity under output 1. \n2  ADB. 2017.

Te Kakeega III: National Strategy for Sustainable Development, 2016 to 2020. Funafuti. \nAs of May 2016, the government is updating the Tuvalu Infrastructure Strategy and Investment Plan 2016 based on \nTe Kakeega III to replace the Infrastructure Strategic Investment Plan, 2011\u20132015. \n\n \n\n \n\n\fNiutao. In parallel, the government also requested the World Bank to improve the Funafuti and \nNanumaga maritime infrastructure under the Maritime Investment in Climate Resilient Operations \nproject. \n \nProject financing and scope. On 16 November 2016, ADB approved grant financing of \n6. \n$8.3  million  from  the  Asian  Development  Fund  and  $3.0  million  from  the  Disaster  Response \nFacility  as  well  as  grant  administration  of  $500,000  from  the  Global  Environmental  Facility  to \nfinance  the  project.6  ADB  provided  a  project  design  advance  (PDA)  grant  for  the  detailed \nengineering design, procurement assistance, and project management of the current project.7 \n \n7. \nThe project scope includes the (i) construction of a workboat harbor in Nukulaelae and \nboat ramps in Nanumaga and Niutao; (ii) provision of technical assistance to improve capacity for \nthe operation and maintenance (O&M) of harbors as part of the institutional strengthening plan; \nand  (iii)  preparation  of  a  master  plan  for  maritime  transport  in  Tuvalu,  including  a  harbor  pre-\nfeasibility study and conceptual funding strategy for the two highest-ranked transport options. \n \nProject  progress.  During  implementation,  the  government  established  a  task  force  to \n8. \noversee the current project and a project management unit (PMU) to implement it. The current \nproject  included  project  management,  construction  supervision,  and  institutional  strengthening \nsupport  as  a  core  component.  It  was  fully  ready  at  approval,  with  the  detailed  design  and \nprocurement strategy prepared through the PDA. The government set up a deferred maintenance \nfund in 2015 to secure O&M resources. These activities led to the satisfactory implementation of \nthe current project and strengthened readiness for the additional financing project.8 \n \n9. \nOperations Manual on Additional Financing.9 \n\nThe  current  project  is  performing  well  and  has  met  all  five  standards  stipulated  in  the \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(b) \n\nDelivery of expected outputs. The current project is on track to meet the intended \noutputs. \n(a) \n\nthe  workboat  harbor \n\nin  Nukulaelae  and \n\nthe \nThe  construction  of \nrehabilitation of the boat ramps in Nanumaga and Niutao started in January \n2018 and is expected to be completed within the original contract period. \nThe government is preparing an O&M manual to keep project deliverables \nin  good  condition  and  to  ensure  that  the  islands\u2019  harbors  will  be  fully \nmaintained  in  the  future.  The  government  will  conduct  training  on  O&M \nwhen construction work ends. \nThe government is preparing a master plan for future harbor development \nin the  outer  islands in 2018 and has  completed pre-feasibility  (high-level \nconcept designs and cost estimates) and feasibility studies for small-scale \nharbors. \n\n(c) \n\nImplementation progress.

Works  are  scheduled  for \ncompletion within the contract period ending by March 2019. \nThe  government  signed  the  project  support  and  master  planning \nconsultancy (PSMPC) contract with Cardno Emerging Markets of Australia \non  13 September  2017.  The  government  is  reviewing  and  approving \nconstruction documents and plans in a timely fashion. \nThe  PSMPC  is  carrying  out  institutional  strengthening  to  establish \nsustainable  asset  management  arrangements  that  are  focused  on \nmaintaining  project  deliverables,  which  is  scheduled  for  completion  by \n31 December 2018. \nThe PSMPC is also preparing a transport master plan, which is scheduled \nfor completion by 31 December 2018. \n\n(b) \n\n(c) \n\n(d) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nSatisfactory  compliance  with  safeguard  policy  requirements.  The  current \nproject has met social and environmental safeguard requirements satisfactorily so \nfar. \nSuccessful  management  of  risks.  The  current  project  incorporated  actions  to \nmitigate risks, which the government is implementing satisfactorily. Nonetheless, \nthe risk rating for the overall project remains moderate. \nOn  track  rating.  ADB\u2019s  project  performance  monitoring  system  has  rated  the \ncurrent project on track since grant effectiveness on 30 August 2017. \n\n \n10. \nAdditional  financing.  The  government  has  requested  additional  grant  financing  from \nADB to the project for a major infrastructure improvement (small work-boat harbour) in Niutao, an \nisland  of  about  600  people.  The  additional  financing  will  (i)  scale  up  and  extend  benefits  by \nconstructing  a  workboat  harbor  in  Niutao,  and  (ii)  finance  cost  overruns  caused  by  the \nappreciation of the Australian dollar by about 10% against the United States dollar and contract \nvariations of about $1 million for the works contract under the project because of the higher cost \nof dredging the channel and the lack of geotechnical data. \n \n11. \nThe  additional  financing  is  justified  given  that  the  overall  project  (i)  remains  technically \nfeasible,  cost-effective,  and  financially  sound;  (ii)  is  consistent  with  the  current  project\u2019s \ndevelopment  objective  to  improve  maritime  transfer  operations  in  Nanumaga,  Niutao,  and \nNukulaelae; (iii) is accorded high priority by the government; and (iv) is consistent with the country \noperations business plan. ADB applied a simplified business process for the additional financing \nbecause the current project has been performing well for a reasonable amount of time. \n \nThe  additional  financing  to  scale  up  project  outputs  is  feasible  given  that  (i)  project \n12. \nmanagement  capacity  of  the  Ministry  of  Communication  and Transport  (MCT)  is  strengthened \nwith a Joint World Bank and ADB\u2019s Project Management Unit, which will implement all maritime \ninfrastructure  projects  in  Tuvalu;  (ii)  the  MCT  has  undertaken  geotechnical  investigations  in \nNiutao,  which  will  reduce  the  procurement  risk  of  receiving  bids  for  the  civil  works  contract \nsubstantially higher than the cost estimate (geotechnical information was not available during the \nprocurement of the civil works under the original project); the PMU has demonstrated sufficient \nfinancial management capacity with duly submitted and approved financial statements; and the \ninstitutional  strengthening,  and  O&M  plan  that  the MCT  are  implementing guarantee  the  asset \nsustainability. These measures contribute to the feasibility of the proposed project and will allow \nits timely implementation and sustainability. \n \n13. \nThe proposed project is suitable for additional financing since it has the same outcome, \nsimilar small outputs, and the same executing and implementing agencies as the current project; \nand builds upon the due diligence of the current project. \n\n \n\n\fOutputs \n\nImpact and Outcomes \n\n \nB. \n \n14. \nThe  impact  of  the  overall  project  remains  unchanged  and  will  be  to  secure  safe  and \nefficient maritime infrastructure in the outer islands, with climate change resilience incorporated \nin infrastructure design, protocols, and operation. The outcomes also remain unchanged and will \nbe to improve maritime transfer operations in Nanumaga, Niutao, and Nukulaelae; and establish \nclear directions for developing transport, fishery, and tourism in the country.10 \n \nC. \n \n15. \nOutput 1 of the overall project will include the construction of a small workboat harbor in \nNiutao  to  higher  standards  of  climate  and  disaster  resilience.

This  amount  includes \n$1.25 million in grant resources from the disaster risk reduction financing mechanism under the \n11th  replenishment  of  the  Asian  Development  Fund.  Tuvalu  will  finance  about  $1.5  million  in \nremaining  project  costs,  consisting  of  land  lease,  compensation  for  economic  losses  from  the \nremoval of trees, counterpart government staff, customs clearance costs, and exemption of taxes \nand duties.

The Ministry of Communication and Transport (MCT) will continue to be \nthe executing agency for the overall project. The MCT appointed the director of its Marine and \nPort Services Department as project director in July 2015 on a part-time basis and as the focal \nperson  for  project  management.  The  project  director  is  assisted  by  the  PMU,  which  has  been \noperating since March 2016. The project director and the PMU supervise and provide counterpart \nsupport  to  a  consulting  firm  that  will  be  engaged  under  the  overall  project  to  provide  project \nmanagement, construction supervision, and capacity building support. \n \nThe World Bank will provide support to the government for the development of maritime \n19. \ninfrastructure in Funafuti and the outer islands through a project scheduled for approval during \nthe first half of 2019. Given the synergies between ADB and World Bank assistance programs, \nthe PMU will be expanded into a Joint ADB\u2013World Bank PMU. The World Bank will recruit new \nstaff  for  the  PMU  and  will  expand  the  roles  and  responsibilities  of  the  existing  staff.  The  ADB \nproject will finance the project manager and project account positions, and the World Bank project \nwill finance the deputy project manager and the part-time safeguard and procurement specialist \npositions. \n \n20. \nThe  government  will  select  the  project  management  and  construction  supervision \nconsultant (PMCSC) through quality- and cost-based selection following ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the \nUse of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time). All procurement of works will follow \nADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2015, as amended from time to time). \n \n21. \nTo expedite project implementation, the government requested advance contracting for \nthe procurement of geotechnical investigation work at the Niutao harbor site. It engaged a service \ncontractor  to  carry  out  the  investigation.  This  will  ensure  that  detailed  information  on  ground \nconditions are known, which will allow civil works bidders to price elements of the works more \naccurately, including dredging of the channel, driving of piles, and crushing of materials.12 \n \nADB and the World Bank agreed to jointly finance the geotechnical investigation, which \n22. \nthe government endorsed in May 2018. The World Bank will finance domestic transportation costs \nestimated at A$175,000, while ADB  will finance drilling works estimated at  A$350,000 and the \n\n                                                \n12 Since the overall project is financed with ADB-administered cofinancing resources, universal procurement will apply. \nADB.  2013.

The government contracted the  drilling \nworks  in  advance  of  grant  approval  (under  retroactive  financing)  and  using  direct  contracting, \napproved by ADB in February 2018, while the laboratory tests and reporting are financed by the \nPDA. \n \n23. \nThe government also requested advance contracting to recruit the PMCSC and procure \nthe works. ADB informed the government that approval of advance contracting does not commit \nADB to finance the project. The implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 3 and \ndescribed in detail in the PAM.13 \n \n24. \nTo increase the readiness of the additional financing project, the government will carry out \nthe following activities during preconstruction using the PDA: (i) producing the final feasibility and \ndue diligence report (by updating initial documents prepared during the project preparation of the \nproposed  additional  financing)  for  approval  by  ADB  and  providing  necessary  support  to  the \ngovernment in facilitating site possession; (ii) updating the detailed design after the completion of \nthe  geotechnical  surveys;  (iii)  updating  the  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE)  and \nenvironmental management plan (EMP), including these in the bid documents, and summarizing \nthe quality and completeness of bidders\u2019 responses to the EMP requirements; and (iv) supporting \nthe government during the advance actions of the bidding for the civil works, including support for \nthe tender stage. \n \n\nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \n\nArrangements \n\nNovember 2018\u2013December 2021 \n31 December 2021  \n30 June 2022 \n\nTask force chair \nMinistry of Communication and Transport  \nMinistry of Communication and Transport \nProject management unit \nInternational competitive bidding \n$11,400,000 \nDirect contracting \n$300,000 \nQuality- and cost-based selection \n$1,000,000 \n$300,000 \nSingle source selection \nADB has approved retroactive financing to finance a portion of the geotechnical \ninvestigation contract.

The  overall  project \n\npassenger terminal. Project preparatory consultants are designing all facilities following Australian \nand New Zealand technical standards with a design life of 50 years. Climate change and potential \ndisaster  risk  impacts  such  as  a  predicted  sea  level  rise,  an  increase  in  wave  height,  and  an \nincrease in the intensity and frequency of tropical cyclones and other risks from extreme weather \nevents have been analyzed under the climate risk vulnerability assessment and are reflected in \nthe  preliminary  and  detailed  design  to  address  the  climate  change  and  disaster  risks.  The \nadaptation  and  disaster  risk  reduction  measures  recommended  for  incorporation  concern  the \nfixed breakwater structures, boat ramp, channel, and onshore facilities.14 The facilities are also \nbeing  designed  to  minimize  and/or  reduce  erosion  and  siltation.  While  structures  made  of \nconcrete and steel do not require significant maintenance, the new channel dredged in Niutao is \nanticipated \ninstitutional \nstrengthening  for  effective  O&M  of  project  assets  to  ensure  the  sustainability  of  the  project \nfacilities. \n \nB. \n \nFollowing the same methodology and approach as that of the current project, the overall \n26. \nproject applied a cost-effectiveness analysis to evaluate the economic viability and determined \nthat the without-project scenario would negatively impact livelihoods because it would continue to \nmake it difficult and under precarious conditions for the population to import basic goods.15 \n \n27. \nThe cost-effectiveness analysis considered two options: (i) a wharf on the northeastern \nside of the island for small landing crafts and/or workboats; and (ii) a wharf at the same site but \nfor large vessels, which is the most socially acceptable solution. The assessment compared the \nnet present value of capital investment costs and travel cost improvements of both options. Not \nall benefits were incorporated, but the options can also be weighed by comparing the travel cost \nimprovement. The assessment determined that the first option is more cost-effective in reducing \ntravel times and vessel-operating costs. \n \n28. \nADB assessed the government\u2019s capacity to sustain project outputs and shipping services \nas adequate. This is not a revenue-generating project, and passenger and cargo revenues will \nnot cover the O&M of the shipping service, including the project facilities. However, the MCT has \nbeen  satisfactorily  maintaining  the  ships  and  to  date  has  avoided  any  major  troubles  during \noperation. The major incremental O&M costs associated with the project will be the maintenance \ndredging of a new channel after every major tropical cyclone, which has been occurring about \nevery  10  years.  Notwithstanding  this,  the  government  will  allocate  an  annual  budget  for  major \nmaintenance to ensure that sufficient funds are available when a cyclone occurs. The financial \nanalysis showed that the MCT will have sufficient revenues and budgetary allocations for such \nincremental major maintenance dredging, estimated at A$100,000 per dredging, and other O&M \nrequirements. Coupled with planned institutional strengthening activities, the overall project will \nestablish satisfactory O&M arrangements covering financial, technical, and institutional aspects. \n \nC. \n \nFinancial  management.  The  financial  management  arrangements  under  the  current \n29. \nproject  will  continue  under  the  overall  project.  A  project  financial  management  assessment \nprepared for the MCT and the Ministry of Finance and Economic Development indicated that the \n\nGovernance \n\n                                                \n14 Climate Risk and Vulnerability Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n15 The project also has unquantifiable benefits such as avoidance of a potential large maritime accident (e.g., sinking \n\nof a passenger ferry, oil tanker, or fishing boats) with major economic, human, and environmental losses. \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\noverall  financial  management  risk  is  moderate.  The  financial  management  assessment  of  the \ncurrent project identified the following key risks: (i) inadequate accounting and claiming of project \nfunds, (ii) incomplete audits, (iii) delayed release of the government counterpart funds, and (iv) \nno internal audit function. The PMU has procured suitable accounting software and makes sure \nthat separate bank accounts are maintained for the receipt of ADB funds. The remaining financial \narrangements under the current project, including support from the Technical Assistance for the \nInstitutional Strengthening of the Ministry of Finance and Economic Development, will continue.16 \n \nProcurement capacity. ADB completed a project procurement risk assessment for the \n30. \nMCT, the Central Procurement Unit, and other offices involved. Overall, the procurement risk is \nmoderate.  The  establishment  of  the  Central  Procurement  Unit  in  2015  helped  reduce  the \nprocurement  risks  under  the  project,  and  the  ADB-financed  technical  assistance  supported \nlegislation  and  institutional  strengthening.  Procurement  risk  will  remain  moderate  only  with \ncontinued support of the PDA consultants and the construction supervision consultant. ADB staff \nwill oversee procurement activities under the project to ensure good governance. The MCT and \nthe PMU agreed to continue joint consultant recruitment with ADB, as officially requested by the \nPMU to ADB in May 2018, using ADB\u2019s Consultant Management System. \n \n31. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary  measures  are \ndescribed in the PAM. \n \nD. \n \nImproving  and  upgrading  maritime  infrastructure  will  give  the  outer  island  communities \n32. \nbetter access to essential services and economic opportunities. The safe and efficient movement \nof  people  and  goods  is  expected  to  increase  economic  activities,  particularly  among  small \nbusiness owners, and reduce migration from the outer islands to Funafuti. Women and poor and \nvulnerable groups, such as people with disabilities and elderly people requiring medical attention, \nare  expected  to  benefit  the  most  because  they  are  particularly  vulnerable  to  accident  risks \nassociated with the lack of harbor facilities in the outer islands. \n \nE. \n \n33. \nThe overall project is classified effective gender mainstreaming, and a gender action plan \n(GAP) was prepared.17 Project design elements that ensure women\u2019s participation and access to \nproject  benefits  include  (i)  women-friendly  design  of  the  maritime  facilities;  (ii) women\u2019s \nparticipation in the capacity building and training activities; (iii) equal employment opportunities \nfor women during construction; (iv) gender awareness activities to target groups (women, elderly, \ndisabled persons); and (v) business opportunities associated with the new harbor (canteen and \ncraft  items). The  MCT  and the  PMU  will  implement  and  monitor  GAP  implementation,  and  will \nengage intermittent international and national social development and gender specialists to assist \nin implementing the GAP.  MCT and the PMU will prepare and implement awareness activities on \nHIV/AIDS and other communicable diseases during construction. \n \n\nPoverty and Social \n\nGender \n\n                                                \n16 ADB.  2012.

Impacts  are  site-specific,  few  if  any  are  irreversible,  and \nmitigation  and  management  measures  can  be  readily  designed  and  implemented  for  most \nimpacts. In compliance with the Safeguard Policy Statement, the Government prepared an IEE \nfor the components to be supported by additional financing. The impacts are limited to the footprint \nof  the  small-scale  workboat  harbor,  including  channel,  and  associated  land-side  facilities  at \nNiutao. These can be mitigated and managed to acceptable levels, provided that the measures \nidentified  in  the  IEE\u2019s  EMP  are  implemented.  ADB  anticipates  short-term  impacts  during \nconstruction\u2014e.g., dust, noise, and waste generated during dredging and civil works\u2014as well as \nminor community and occupational health and safety risks. The Department of Environment within \nthe Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Trade, Tourism, Environment, and Labor has adequate capacity \nto  manage  environmental  issues  with  consultant  support.  In  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Public \nCommunications Policy, ADB will disclose the IEE and subsequent monitoring reports on ADB\u2019s \nwebsite.  As  in  the  current  project,  the  contractor  will  prepare  its  construction  environmental \nmanagement  plan  (CEMP)  based  on  the  EMP  and  sediment  plume  modeling.  The  PMU  will \nreview  and  clear  the  CEMP,  and  the  PMU  (assisted  by  the  PMCSC)  and  the  Department  of \nEnvironment will monitor compliance with, and effectiveness of, the CEMP. \n \n36. \nInvoluntary  resettlement  (category  C).  The  construction  of  a  small-scale  harbor  at \nNiutao  will  be  on  government  or  community  lands.  The  associated  facilities\u2014such  as  the \npassenger terminal, water tanks, and a warehouse\u2014will be built on private lands where, as in the \ncurrent project, the landowners have expressed willingness to enter into lease agreements with \nthe government. The government will comply with the negotiated settlement requirements under \nADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  and  the  country\u2019s  established  lease  procedures.  Failure  to \nnegotiate  the  lease  will  not  result  in  compulsory  acquisition.  Consultations  were  held  with  the \naffected  communities  and  other  stakeholders,  and  will  continue  during  implementation  by  the \ngovernment. \n \nIndigenous peoples (category C). The project will not have an impact on any distinct \n37. \nand vulnerable group of indigenous peoples. The MCT will implement the project in a culturally \nappropriate and participatory manner. All residents will equally benefit from the improved marine \ntransportation facilities. \n \nG. \n \n38. \nThe  project  risk  is  moderate.  Major  risks  and  mitigating  measures  are  summarized  in \nTable 4 and described in detail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.19 The integrated \nbenefits and impacts are expected to outweigh the risk and costs. \n \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nRisks \nThe limited number of government staff have \ninsufficient experience in implementing large \ninvestment projects. \n\nMitigating Measures \nThe project management and construction supervision consultant, \nthe Joint World Bank\u2013ADB PMU, and a consulting firm for project \nimplementation support will assist the MCT. \n\n                                                \n18 ADB.
