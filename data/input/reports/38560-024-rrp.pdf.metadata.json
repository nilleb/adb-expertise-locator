The report also describes (i) the proposed administration of a grant to \nbe  provided  by  the  Sanitation  Financing  Partnership  Trust  Fund1 under  the  Water  Financing \nPartnership  Facility,  and  (ii)  the  proposed  administration  of  technical  assistance  (TA)  to  be \nprovided  by  the  Japan  Fund  for  Poverty  Reduction,  both  for  the  additional  financing  of  the \nSecond  Rural  Water  Supply  and  Sanitation  Sector  Project,  and  if  the  Board  approves  the \nproposed  loan,  I,  acting  under  the  authority  delegated  to  me  by  the  Board,  approve  the \nadministration of grant and TA.2 \n \nThe  project  was  designed  to  expand  access  to  improved  rural  water  supply  and \n2. \nsanitation (RWSS) and to improve the health of rural residents in six provinces around the Tonle \nSap  Lake  in  Cambodia. 3 Since  its  approval  in  2009,  the  project  contributed  to  government \nefforts  to  achieve  its  Millennium  Development  Goal  targets  of  increased  rural  water  supply \ncoverage by 50% and rural sanitation coverage by 30% by 2015, and its long-term sector vision \nof  universal  coverage  by  2025.  The  project  is  performing  well.  The  additional  financing  will \nfinance partial changes in scope and expand activities. It will support the current project\u2019s original \nobjectives,  enhance  monitoring,  and \ntest  climate  change  adaptation  and  disaster  risk \nmanagement initiatives. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\n \nRationale \nA. \n3. \nMore  than  77%  of  Cambodia\u2019s  population  lives  in  rural  areas.  A  focus  on  rural \ndevelopment,  infrastructure,  and  delivery  of  basic  services  is  the  first  step  in  accelerating \npoverty  reduction,  reducing  regional  inequalities,  and  supporting  inclusive  growth.  Rural \nresidents  spend  considerable  time  and  financial  resources  acquiring  their  daily  drinking  water \nfrom distant water sources, collecting rainwater, or having it delivered to their homes. In 2014, \naccess  to  improved  water  supply  sources  in  rural  areas  was  51.1%,  and  access  to  improved \nsanitation was 46.2%.4 The type of water supply and sanitation facilities available to households \nare  important  determinants  of  community  health.5 An  intensified  focus  on  RWSS  will  increase \nlow levels of coverage, improve health, and accelerate poverty reduction, especially in the Tonle \nSap Basin where most of Cambodia's poorest live.6 An integrated approach to RWSS will also \ncontribute to gender equity and livelihood improvements. \n \n4. \nOn  15  September  2009,  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  approved  a  grant \nequivalent to $21 million for the Second Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Sector Project.7 The \nexpected  outcome  was  improved  access  to  water  supply  for  377,000  rural  residents  and \nsanitation  for  290,000  rural  residents  in  400  villages  in  40  communes  in  16 districts  of  six \nprovinces.  The  project  covers  100%  of  villages  in  each  commune  and  aims  to  achieve  100% \n\n                                                \n1  Financing partner: Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. \n2  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n3  Banteay Meanchey, Battambang, Kampong Chhnang, Kampong Thom, Pursat, and Siem Reap provinces. \n4  Ministry of Planning. 2015.

Manila. \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nwater  supply  and  at  least  80%  physical  sanitation  coverage  in  each  commune.  It  is  a  sector \ninvestment  project  with  five  outputs:  (i)  improved  community  health  and  hygiene  practices; \n(ii) rehabilitated,  upgraded,  and  new  water  facilities;  (iii)  improved  public  and  household \nsanitation;  (iv)  strengthened  sector  planning  and  development;  and  (v)  improved  capacity  for \nproject implementation. \n \n5. \nImplementation  progress.  The  project  is  performing  well  and  rated  on  track,  with \ncumulative  contract  awards  amounting  to  $21  million  (99%),  and  cumulative  disbursements \namounting  to  $21  million  (99%)  as  of  30 June  2016.  ADB  approved  a  cumulative  extension  of \n12 months  (to  31 December  2016)  to  (i)  complete  latrine  building  works,  and  (ii) process \nadditional  financing.  The  performance  of  the  experienced  executing  agency\u2014the  Ministry  of \nRural  Development  (MRD), \nimplementing  agencies,  and  consultants  was  consistently \nsatisfactory.  Targets  for  contract  awards  and  disbursements  were  met  annually  and  MRD \nsubstantially complied with grant covenants.8 \n \n6. \nAchievements  to  date  and  opportunity  for  expansion.  The  project  successfully \ncompleted  assistance  to  32  communes  in  four  batches,  covering  364  villages  in  six  provinces \naround  the  Tonle  Sap  Lake.  The  project  benefited  a  population  of  338,200  through  improved \nwater  supply  facilities. 9  The  project  also  provided  sanitation  grants  to  45,677  households \n(208,500  people)  for  latrine  construction  and  encouraged  a  further  4,219  households  (25,000 \npeople) to finance their own latrine, increasing average sanitation coverage to 80%.10 While the \nproject covered fewer communes, it achieved 90% of its rural water supply target and 93% of its \nrural  sanitation  target.  The  project  (categorized  gender  equity  as  a  theme)  significantly \ncontributed to strengthening women\u2019s roles in local government and project-related committees, \nincluding  all  training  activities  (mostly  exceeding  the  40%  target).  In  partnership  with  other \ndonors,  the  project  assessed  the  means  to  enhance  climate  change  resilience  for  rural  water \ninfrastructure,  including the  provision  of  low-cost bottled  water  and  the treatment  and reuse of \nhousehold  latrine  waste.  Building  on  the  project\u2019s  success,  there  is  opportunity  to  expand \naccess  to  improved  RWSS  to  an  additional  275  villages  in  28  communes  in  the  same  six \nprovinces, 11  increasing the total number of villages to 639 across 59 communes. 12 \n \n7. \nModification  and  cost  increase. The  project suffered  marginal  overspending  of  10%, \nunder output 2, to construct new deeper wells because of the inability to rehabilitate some wells, \nwhich  could  not  supply  safe  water  year  round.  In  addition,  $500,000  was  reallocated  for \nemergency well rehabilitation in 2012 following the severe 2011 Cambodia flooding. As a result, \nonly 32 out of 40 communes were completed. Other project components met budget allocations. \n \n8. \nRationale  for  additional  financing.  Additional financing  will  be  needed  to (i)  scale  up \nproject activities in 19 new communes (para. 6), increasing beneficiaries; and (ii) complete the \noriginally  targeted  40  communes,  which  fell  short  after  changes  in  project  design  (para.  7). \nAccording  to  the  National  Action  Plan  2014\u20132018,  the  government  target  for  2018  is  60% \ncoverage for RWSS, resulting in a national gap of 439,400 households (2.02 million people) for \nwater supply and 580,400 households (2.67 million people) for sanitation. 13 The current annual \n\n                                                \n8  Summary of Progress Against Grant Covenants (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n9  Facilities include (i) rehabilitation of 1,324 drill wells, 325 hand dug wells, 365 combined wells, and 53 community \nponds;  and  (ii)  development  of  985  new  drill  wells,  6  combined  wells,  75,330  rainwater  jars,  1,130  bio-sand  and \nceramic water filters, 24 piped water supply systems, 99 river water distribution points, and 28 production wells. \n\n10 Summary of Project Performance (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n11 28 communes comprise: 1 commune only half completed from initial list of 32, and 27 additional communes. \n12 Scope of Additional Financing (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n13 MRD. 2014. National Action Plan: Rural Water Supply, Sanitation, and Hygiene 2014\u20132018. Phnom Penh. \n\n\flevels  of  growth  for  water  supply  (1.8%)  and  sanitation  (4.3%  post-2010)  are  insufficient  to \nreach the 2018 target coverage, and both must be accelerated to at least 5% per annum until \n2025 to realize the vision of 100% coverage. Improved water supply coverage ranges from 3.5% \nto 42.0% in the 27 additional proposed communes, and sanitation coverage ranges from 0.9% \nto 45.0%. These figures are lower than the national average. \n \n9. \nThe  project  is  performing  well:  it  has  successfully  delivered  expected  outputs  and \nmaintained  satisfactory  implementation  progress  and  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  policies.  The \neligibility  criteria  for  additional  financing  are  met,  including  (i)  the  overall  project\u2019s  continuing \nscope;  (ii)  its  validity,  soundness,  and  strategic  importance  to  underpin  welfare  and  poverty \nreduction; and (iii) its consistency with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for Cambodia, 2014\u2013\n2018.14 The additional financing modality is suitable because of (i) strong links with the current \nproject,  including  capacities  developed;  (ii)  a  high  degree  of  project  readiness,  and  a  well-\nperforming  executing  agency;  and  (iii)  scaling  up  project  benefits  using  innovative  designs  in \nclimate change and sanitation developed under the TA and grant. \n \nStrategic  alignment.  Additional  financing  will  contribute  to  the  government\u2019s  efforts  to \n10. \nachieve  universal  coverage  for  improved  water  supply  and  sanitation  coverage  by  2025.  The \nproject  (i)  remains  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  country  partnership  strategy,  which  focuses  on \nstrengthening  urban\u2013rural  links  in  the  Tonle  Sap  Basin;  and  (ii)  is  included  in  ADB\u2019s  country \noperations  business  plan  for  Cambodia,  2016\u20132018.15 Lessons  include  (i)  the  need  for  greater \nfocus  on  gender  and  leadership  to  overcome  cultural  norms;  (ii)  the  need  to  develop  equitable \nsolutions to address increases in the cost of community small piped water supply facilities, which \nhamper  poorer  households  meeting  beneficiary  contributions;  and  (iii)  the  need  to  introduce \nclimate change adaptation and mitigation together with disaster risk management to address the \nimpact of climate change on RWSS, which  is becoming significant with more severe floods and \ndroughts and the depletion of groundwater sources in the dry season. \n \nB. \n \n11. \nThe  impact  of  the  overall  project,  which  is  aligned  with  the  government\u2019s  National \nStrategy for Rural Water Supply, Sanitation and Hygiene (footnote 13), will be universal access \nto  sustainable  RWSS  nationwide  by  2025  and  improved  health  of  rural  households  in  project \nprovinces.  The  outcome  of  the  overall  project  remains  unchanged:  increased  access  to \nimproved  RWSS  in  selected  communes  of  six  provinces  around  the  Tonle  Sap  Lake.  The \nnumber of rural residents with access to improved water will increase from 377,000 to 578,500, \nwhile  the  number  of  rural  residents  with  access  to  improved  sanitation  will  increase  from \n290,000  to  462,800.  Additional  financing  will  build  and  expand  the  current  project  outputs  as \nfollows: \n \nImproved  community  health  and  hygiene  practices.  Output  1  will  (i)  increase \n12. \ncommunity mobilization and action in 275 additional villages; (ii) prepare additional village water \nsupply  and  sanitation  plans  for  27  additional  communes;  (iii) form  and  train  2,200  additional \nwater  and  sanitation  user  groups  (WSUGs);  (iv) strengthen  community  groups  and  individuals \nfor effective delivery of health and hygiene, as well as climate and disaster risk messages; and \n(v) improve household-level water and sanitation management. \n \n\nImpact, Outcome, and Outputs \n\n                                                \n14 ADB. 2014.

Output  2  will  deliver \n13. \nthe following additional targets: (i) rehabilitation and/or upgrading of existing water supply points \nand  development  of  new  water  supply  points  to  provide  universal  safe  water  supply  coverage \nfor  275  villages  (2,200  water  supply  points);  (ii)  new  rainwater  collection  systems  and  storage \ntanks for  at  least  140  public facilities,  including  schools  and health facilities;  and (iii)  improved \nmonitoring of water quality for all water facilities, including the development of a national water \nquality  monitoring  program.  New  construction  will  be  based  on  the  cost-sharing  principles \nalready adopted and implemented under the current project. \n \n14. \nImproved  public  and  household  sanitation.  Output 3 will reduce open defecation by \nexpanding sanitation coverage to at least 80% through the provision of (i) 135 new public latrine \nblocks  at  schools  and  health  facilities;  and  (ii)  34,500  additional  grants  for  the  poor  and \nvulnerable for household latrine construction. \n \n15. \n Strengthened  sector  planning  and  development.  Output  4  will  continue  to  provide \n(i) improved  monitoring  and  supervision  of  RWSS  facilities  by  maintaining  and  upgrading  the \nRWSS  database  used  under  the  current  project  in  six  provinces,  (ii)  support  to  the  water  and \nsanitation  sector  working  group  coordination  meetings,  (iii)  strengthened  private  sector \ninvolvement  in  RWSS  development  through  training  in  technical  and  management  fields,  and \n(iv)  improved  RWSS  monitoring  and  evaluation  for  health  outcomes.  Additional  financing  will \nfinance  training  for  climate  change  adaptation  and  mitigation  and  develop  disaster  risk \nmanagement plans for RWSS at national, provincial, commune, and village levels. \n \n16. \n Improved  capacity  for  project  implementation  and  sustainability.

The loan will have a 32-year \nterm, including a grace period of 8 years, an interest rate of 1.0% per annum during the grace \nperiod and 1.5% per annum thereafter, and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft \nloan agreement. The Sanitation Financing Partnership Trust Fund16 under the Water Financing \nPartnership  Facility  will  provide  a  grant  not  exceeding  the  equivalent  of  $1.5 million  and  the \nJapan  Fund  for  Poverty  Reduction  will  provide  TA  not  exceeding  the  equivalent  of  $2  million, \nboth to be administered by ADB. \n \n19. \nThe  government  also  requested  that  taxes  and  duties  associated  with  recurrent  costs \nand  training  be  financed  by  the  loan  to  avoid  excessive  administration  for  small  costs.  Such \ntaxes  and  duties  will  (i)  not  represent  an  excessive  share  of  the  project  investment  plan,  and \n(ii) only apply to ADB-financed expenditures. \n \nD. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nThe implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 3 and described in detail in \n20. \nthe  project  administration  manual  (PAM).17 MRD  remains  the  executing  agency.  The  current \nproject  coordination  unit,  within  the  Department  of  Rural  Water  Supply,  will  be  maintained  for \nproject management and coordination.

Recruitment  of  new  consultants  will  not  be  required.  A  contract \nvariation  will  be  prepared  to  extend  the  contract  of  the  current  project  implementation \nconsultants.  Subproject  feasibility  studies,  which  have  been  developed  for  the  first  batch  of \n10 communes,  identify  infrastructure  solutions  based  on  standard  detailed  designs  developed \nunder the current project. Bidding documents for selected contracts have also been prepared for \nadvance contracting using the latest standard bidding documents.18 \n \n\nIII. \n\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n\nThe  TA  will  be  implemented  over  24  months  and  will  support  the  progressive \n22. \nmainstreaming of climate change adaptation and disaster risk management into RWSS. The TA \nis  estimated  to  cost  $2,264,000,  of  which  $2,000,000  will  be  financed  on  a  grant  basis  by  the \nJapan Fund for Poverty Reduction. ADB will be the executing agency and administer the TA. 19 \nThe  government  will  provide  counterpart  support  in  the  form  of  staff,  office  accommodation, \nlocal  land  transport,  and  other  in-kind  contributions.  The  TA  will  integrate  new  concepts  and \ninitiatives linked directly to the loan, including (i) development of rural water safety plans for both \nrural water and sanitation; (ii) education and training in climate change resilience and adaptation \nfor  RWSS,  particularly  for  floods,  droughts,  and  impacts  on  groundwater;  (iii)  disaster  risk \nmanagement  (planning,  response,  and  recovery)  to  better  prepare  and  react  to  impacts  from \nclimate  variability  and change;  and (iv) mainstreaming of climate  change  activities  directly  into \nthe  RWSS  program  and  resulting  infrastructure,  specifically  targeting  local  government  and \nvillage levels, where the climate change impacts are directly felt. These will be achieved through \nthree primary outputs: (i) a new RWSS capacity development program to increase knowledge at \nnational  and  provincial  levels  and  enhance  project  sustainability;  (ii)  capacity  development  in \nRWSS to increase operational knowledge at commune and village levels; and (iii) new initiatives \nfor enhanced project sustainability. \n \n\nIV. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nTechnical \n\n \nA. \n \n23. \nCompliance with selection criteria will be required for new subprojects. This is based on \nfactors  such  as  the  incidence  of  poverty  and  existing  water  supply  and  sanitation  coverage. \nFeedback  from  project  beneficiaries  relating  to  equipment,  facilities,  and  technologies  used \n                                                \n18 Subproject feasibility studies and bidding documents are being reviewed by ADB. \n19 Attached Technical Assistance (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n\fhave led to the development of tried-and-tested standard designs, which are selected based on \nthe prevailing conditions at each commune and village. These designs have proven to be robust, \ndurable,  technically  viable,  and  well  received  by  the  communities.  The  project  will  scale  up \ndesigns proven to be compatible with local conditions and community capacity for operation and \nmaintenance (O&M). Location and design features of RWSS facilities will factor in disaster and \nclimate  risk  considerations,  specifically  to provide  improved  protection from flood damage and \npotential  contamination  from  latrines  during  flooding.  Lessons  identified  in  para.  10  will  be \nconsidered to further improve project performance and sustainability. Additional refinements will \nbe made as more emphasis is placed on sustainability, climate change adaptation, and disaster \nrisk management. \n \nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n24. \nTwo sample subproject communes were selected for feasibility. The economic viability of \ntwo sample communes\u2014Kouk Khathen in Banteay Meanchey and Ngom in Kampong Thom\u2014\nwas  assessed.  The  analysis  evaluated  a  range  of  technical  options  and  confirmed  that  each \nsubproject  is  the  least-cost  option  for  each  commune. 20   Taking  into  account  the  cost  of  the \nwater supply and the sanitation facilities, the economic internal rate of return is 16.2% for Kouk \nKhathen  and  18.8%  for  Ngorn,  and  remained  above  12%  for  all  sensitivity  scenarios.  Both \nsubprojects  are  economically  viable.  The  economic  benefits  of  the  water  supply  components \ninclude (i) storage cost avoided, (ii) treatment cost avoided, and (iii) the value of time saved for \nnot having to collect water. For sanitation, the economic benefits include (i) productivity savings \nbecause of reduced incidence of diseases, and (ii) health care costs avoided. Economic costs \nwere derived from the financial estimates of capital investments and O&M costs after eliminating \nall duties and taxes, estimating the traded and nontraded components of costs, and multiplying \nthe  net  results  by  appropriate  conversion factors.  Under  the  project,  the  government  provided \ntechnical  support  to  the  beneficiary  communities  to  ensure  the  sustainability  of  the  largely \ngranted  water  supply  and  sanitation  facilities,  including  establishing  appropriate  institutional \narrangements  such  as  WSUGs  for  community-managed  facilities.  The  financial  analysis \nreviewed project achievements and found WSUGs exercised ownership over their facilities, with \naffordable user charges collected at least to cover O&M costs (e.g., piped water systems). 21 \n \nC. \n\nGovernance \n\n25. \nUtilization  of  project  funds  was  substantially  in  accordance  with  the  original  plan,  but \nreallocation of funds was needed several times to align budgets with actual conditions and the \nincreased  budgetary  requirement  for  new  water  supply  facilities.  Management  of  the  imprest \naccount  versus  disbursements  initially  caused  some  delays  in  implementation  because  of  the \nlarge  number  of  contracts  under  community  procurement,  but  this  was  resolved  with  an \nincrease in the imprest account ceiling. Procurement oversight and financial management of the \nproject by the executing agency and Ministry of Economy and Finance was highly satisfactory \nespecially  given  the  1,792  contracts  procured,  administered,  and  completed.  Institutional \ncapacity  developed  satisfactorily  and  implementation  issues  were  addressed  adequately  to \nensure  that  the  project  continuously  met  or  exceeded  performance  targets  throughout \nimplementation.  No  complaints  or  incidences  were  recorded  with  respect  to  corruption  and \ncompliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was  satisfactory. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy was explained to and discussed with the government and the MRD. \n\n                                                \n20 Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n21 Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nThe  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary  measures  are  described  in  the  PAM \n(footnote 17). \n \nD. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n26. \nThe project will directly benefit 253,000 rural residents with access to improved water, of \nwhich  190,000  people  will  also  benefit  from  improved  sanitation  facilities  in  28  communes. \nBased  on  the  figures  from  the  current  project,  60%  of  the  project  beneficiaries  are  poor  or \nvulnerable  given  (i)  the  higher-than-average  rural  population  share,  (ii) rural  poverty  being \nhigher  than  urban  poverty,  (iii) the  higher-than-average poverty  incidence in project  provinces, \nand  (iv) the  targeting  methodology  that  reaches  the  poorest  communes  in  the  project  area. \nAccess to improved RWSS will improve the health status of households (especially children and \nthe  elderly)  and  reduce  medical  expenditure,  through  the  supply  of  improved  RWSS  facilities, \nsanitation awareness, and training in water, sanitation, and health. It also increases the rate of \nchild  survival,  which  is  a  precursor  to  the  demographic  transition  to  lower  fertility  rates.  The \nadditional financing will not have any significant adverse impacts, as potential adverse impacts \nidentified during project preparation were eliminated or mitigated by changes in design.22 \n \n27. \nGender.  A  gender  action  plan  builds  on  the  implementation  experiences  of  that \ndeveloped  for  the  current  project. 23 It  ensures  broad  understanding  of  and  attention  to  the \ndifferent  needs  of  women  and  men  in  the  RWSS  sector,  and  provides  equal  opportunities  for \nwomen  and  men  to  access  project  benefits  and  participate  in  capacity  development  activities. \nSpecific targets include the following: (i) at least 50% of the selected commune and village focal \npersons, including peer leaders, are women; (ii) at least 40% of RWSS committee and WSUG \nboard  members  are  women;  and  (iii)  village  project  activities  are  implemented  in  cooperation \nwith  the  commune  council  committees  on  women  and  children's  affairs.  The  plan  is  in \naccordance  with  the  Ministry  of  Women\u2019s  Affairs  national  strategy  for  gender  mainstreaming, \nMRD gender working group action plan, and ADB\u2019s Policy on Gender and Development (1998). \n \nE. \n\nSafeguards \n\n28. \nEnvironment.  The  current  project  was  category  B  for  environment.  Compliance  with \nenvironmental safeguard requirements was satisfactory and risks were adequately managed.24 \nAll  subprojects  supported  under  the  current  project  were  screened  and  categorized  in \naccordance  with  the  environmental  assessment  and  review  framework  prepared  in  2009,  and \nclassified category C. 25 Civil works financed under the overall project are limited to small-scale \ncommunity-based  RWSS  equipment  and  facilities.  The  environmental  impacts  associated  with \nthe  installation  of  facilities  are  minimal  and  temporary  (including  noise,  dust,  and  community \nhealth  and  safety  related  to  minor  excavation  and  drilling  works),  highly  localized  and  site-\nspecific,  and  can  be  easily  mitigated  with  good  construction  practices  commonly  known  to \ncontractors.  All  RWSS facilities to be  supported  under the  additional financing  will  be  installed \nwithin  boundaries  of  existing  villages  and  directly  contribute  to  the  Tonle  Sap  Biosphere \nReserve\u2019s  development  function  to  foster  sustainable  development  of  ecology,  environment, \neconomy,  society,  and  culture.26 The  overall  project  remains  category  B.  The  framework  was \n\n                                                \n22 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n23 Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n24 Review missions were conducted on 25\u201331 October 2015 and on 15\u201321 May 2016. \n25 The  2009  framework  was  prepared  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy  (2002),  Environmental \n\nAssessment Guidelines (2003), and the government\u2019s environmental requirements. \n\n26 The  Tonle  Sap  Biosphere  Reserve,  which  was  established  by  a  royal  decree  in  2001,  has  three  functions: \n(i) conservation\u2014protection  of  biological  diversity,  landscapes,  and  ecosystem;  (ii) development\u2014sustainable \n\n\fupdated  to  conform  to  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009)  and  to  address  some  of  the \nweaknesses  in  adhering  to  compliance  procedures  that  were  identified  during  due  diligence \nactivities.27 The  nine  subprojects  identified  as  the  first  batch  of  the  additional  financing  have \nbeen  confirmed  as  category  C.  The  climate  risk  to  the  additional  financing  is  considered \nmedium.  Siting  of  RWSS  facilities  will  be  identified  in  consultation  with  local  communities  to \navoid  flood-prone  areas  and  facility  design  will  be  improved  to  provide  greater  resistance  to \nflood  damage.  Neither  will  significantly  increase  costs.  The  attached  TA  will  help  increase \nclimate resilience of RWSS. \n \n29. \nLand  acquisition  and  resettlement.  The  current  project  did  not  require  any  land \nacquisition  as  households  within  the  target  villages  voluntarily  donated  land  for  water  points \n(hand  pumps)  and  larger  parcels  of  land,  such  as  community  ponds,  were  situated  on \ngovernment  land.  No  loss  of  livelihood  or  income  occurred.  Due  diligence  showed  that \nhouseholds  voluntarily  provided  their  land  with  no  evidence  of  coercion  or  pressure  and  the \ndonation  was  conducted  with  full  consultation  of  the  landowners  and  households  within  the \nvillage.  The  overall  project  has  been  classified  category  C  for  involuntary  resettlement.  The \nadditional financing will adhere to methods used for the current project; namely, land donations \nfor water points where hand pumps will be placed. The lengthy process of land titling is ongoing \nand  completion  will  be  monitored  during  project  implementation.  To  ensure  that  screening  is \nconducted  and  procedures  are  followed,  an  involuntary  resettlement,  indigenous  peoples,  and \nsocial  safeguards  screening  guidance  note  is  provided. 28  Subprojects  with  involuntary \nresettlement impacts will not be eligible for financing. Due diligence will be exercised to ensure \nthat  poor  households  are  not  required  to  donate  land.  Due  diligence  shall  be  carried  out  on  a \nrandom sample of each subproject.  \n \n30. \nIndigenous  peoples.  As  with  the  current  project,  the  overall  project  is  classified \ncategory  B  for  indigenous  people  safeguards,  which  are  triggered  because  the  Chams  are  a \ndistinct  group  that  will  experience  project  impacts,  albeit  purely  positive  impacts.  The  project \nidentified  three  Cham  villages  within  Kampong  Thom,  Kampong  Chhnang,  and  Pursat \nprovinces,  specifically  within  the  Boeng,  Khabt Trach,  Svay,  Svay  Chhick,  Cheab,  and Phteas \nRong  communes.  The  said  villages  are  predominantly,  if  not  100%,  Cham.  In  this  light, \nelements of an indigenous peoples plan are included in the project design in lieu of preparing a \nplan. Though no separate plan is required, monitoring reports will include a specific section on \nCham villages and provide evidence of meaningful consultation and specific culturally sensitive \nand appropriate actions that were implemented. \n \nF. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n31. \nThe  overall  risk  assessment  is  medium,  and  the  integrated  benefits  and  impacts  are \nexpected to outweigh the costs. Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 \nand described in detail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.29 \n \n\n                                                                                                                                                       \ndevelopment  of  ecology,  environment,  economy,  society,  and  culture;  and  (iii)  logistic\u2014demonstration  projects, \nenvironmental education and training, research, and monitoring. \n\n27 Environmental Assessment and Review Framework (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n28 Involuntary  Resettlement,  Indigenous  Peoples,  and  Social Safeguard  Screening  Guidance  Note  (accessible  from \n\nthe list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n29 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\nRisk \nLack of beneficiary \ncontributions for small piped \nwater supply systems \n\nPoor sustainability of WSUGs \nand tariff collection for \ncommunity-managed small \npiped water supply systems \nInadequate water supply \n\nPoor water quality \n\nPoor sustainability of \ncommunal water supply \nfacilities \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nMitigating Measures \nThe current project provides detailed and accurate estimate of costs and \nrequired beneficiary contributions.
