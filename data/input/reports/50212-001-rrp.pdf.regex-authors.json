THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \npolicy-based loan (PBL) to the Cook Islands for the Disaster Resilience Program.1 \n \n2.  The Cook Islands is located in a part of the South Pacific Ocean that is at high risk from \nnatural hazards, particularly cyclones, tsunamis, and floods. To reduce risks from, better plan \nfor, respond to, and recover from disasters, the country is taking important steps to improve its \ndisaster risk management (DRM) system. The proposed program will provide the Government \nof the Cook Islands rapid access to financing, contingent on a disaster affecting the country.2 \nFunds will be used to help meet short-term, post-disaster recovery needs. To establish eligibility \nto access the contingent financing, the government has undertaken prior policy actions that (i) \nclarify and implement policy and institutional arrangements for DRM, including the capacity for \npost-disaster response and recovery; (ii) improve the disaster resilience of physical assets; and \n(iii) expand disaster risk financing. Post-program monitoring will ensure continued progress \ntoward attaining overall program goals. \n \nII.  THE PROGRAM \nA.  Rationale \n3.  Development context. The Cook Islands has a resident population of about 14,974 \ndispersed across 15 small islands, comprising a land area of 67 square kilometers spread over \n2 million square kilometers of the South Pacific Ocean; 70% of the population lives on the \nlargest island of Rarotonga.3 The economy is well managed, tax revenues are strong, and fiscal \ndeficits were below 2% of gross domestic product (GDP) during FY2010\u2013FY2015. Although \nexternal debt is rising, it remains at a sustainable level (24.8% of GDP in FY2016) and is well \nwithin the government\u2019s threshold of 35.0% of GDP.4 The country\u2019s average economic growth in \nFY2010\u2013FY2015 was 2.2% per year, driven largely by strong growth in the tourism sector, \nwhich accounts for about 60.0% of GDP.5 But this average hides annual fluctuations that have \nseen GDP growth vary from \u20132.7% to 4.8% during FY2010\u2013FY2015, depending on changing \nexternal, trade, and investment conditions. \n \n4.  Disaster risk. The Cook Islands is highly vulnerable to disasters, and has periodically \nexperienced major cyclones that have caused substantial economic damage and loss of life. \n(Tables 1 and 2). \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  Contingent financing was previously used in Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2009.

Rarotonga. \n4  A debt sustainability analysis, which ADB did based on the World Bank and International Monetary Fund template \nand guidelines, assumes long run growth of 2.0%, declining fiscal deficits from 0.5% to 0.1%, and inflation at 2.0% \nover the long term (ADB. 2016. Cook Islands: Macroeconomic Assessment. Consultant\u2019s report. Manila [TA 8565-\nREG]). \n5  The Cook Islands is not a member of the International Monetary Fund or the World Bank Group. In place of the \nInternational Monetary Fund\u2019s assessment letter, a Macroeconomic Assessment Summary (accessible from the list \nof linked documents in Appendix 2) has been prepared based on a detailed assessment carried out by ADB at the \nrequest  of  the  Government  of  the  Cook  Islands  (ADB.  2016.  Cook  Islands:  Macroeconomic  Assessment. \nConsultant\u2019s report.

The Cook Islands: Disaster Risk Financing and Insurance. Washington, DC. \n \n5.  The country\u2019s high exposure to disaster risk is due to (i) its geographic location in the \nSouth Pacific cyclone belt; (ii) the remoteness and low-lying nature of many of its islands; and \n(iii) the proximity of many buildings and infrastructure services to the coast, especially on the \nlargest island of Rarotonga. In addition, the heavy reliance on revenues from the tourism sector \nmakes the economy vulnerable to the impact of disasters. \n \n6.  The financial resources for short-term recovery6 needed to reduce the economic and \nsocial  impact  of  disasters  through  swift  action  are  likely  to  be  significant.  However,  the \nGovernment of the Cook Islands currently has few options for accessing sufficient post-disaster \nfinancing, leaving the country vulnerable to the impact of disasters. For example, in addition to \nthe overall impact on the economy indicated in Table 1, annual GDP growth fell from 2.2% in \n2004 to \u20131.1% in 2005, after four cyclones in early 2005, before it recovered to 5.0% in 2006. \nThe average quarterly GDP growth was 0.8% in 2009, dropped to \u20132.7% following Cyclone Pat \nin 2010, and recovered to 0.7% in 2011. \n \n7.  Government  strategy.  To  mitigate  the  economic  risk  posed  by  disasters,  the \ngovernment has put in place arrangements to cover different layers of disaster risk financing. A \ndisaster emergency trust fund\u2014established in 20117 with a current balance of NZ$1.5 million\u2014\n                                                \n6  Short-term recovery focuses on activities that continue beyond the emergency period to reestablish lifelines, and \nmay typically include providing temporary shelter, restoring power and water, clearing debris, providing small \nbusiness loans and work assistance, and delivering critical stress debriefing to emergency responders and victims. \n7  Government of the Cook Islands. 2011. Policy Governing the Establishment and Operation of the Cook Islands \nDisaster Emergency Trust Fund. Rarotonga. \n ", "3 \nwas created to serve as an initial source of government-allocated funds to respond to disasters. \nThe government has also taken out insurance coverage under the Pacific Catastrophe Risk \nAssessment and Financing Initiative (PCRAFI) for cyclones, with a 1-in-10-year probability of \noccurrence and payout based on the assessed severity of a specific cyclone. 8 The country has \nnot experienced a cyclone triggering a payout since it joined PCRAFI in 2014, but continues to \npurchase cover as an element of a broader risk financing framework. However, having the \ndisaster  emergency  trust fund  in  place  and the  potential for  an  insurance  payout  through \nPCRAFI is unlikely to be sufficient for the Government of the Cook Islands to finance the cost of \nshort-term recovery needs following a significant disaster. \n \n8.  In addition to taking steps to reduce financial exposure to disaster risk, the government \nhas put in place an improved DRM policy and institutional arrangements. Major DRM policy and \nplanning documents have been prepared. For example, the current national development plan \nincludes a specific measurable goal to strengthen resilience to combat the impacts of climate \nchange and natural disasters.9 The Cook Islands was among the first countries in the Pacific to \nprepare  a  joint  action  plan  that  integrated  DRM  and  climate  change  adaptation,  including \nimplementation arrangements to link national and local planning systems.10 The Disaster Risk \nManagement Act, 2007 defines legal responsibilities for DRM and specifies the procedures for \nthe formal declaration of a state of disaster. \n \n9.  ADB engagement  and lessons learned. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has \nprovided  financial  support  to  the  Cook  Islands  to  assist  with  post-disaster  reconstruction \nfollowing previous cyclones, including for the procurement of materials and equipment, transport \nsupplies and personnel to disaster areas, civil works, and the restoration of major productive \nactivities, such as pearl farming, fishing, and agriculture.11 The Pacific Regional Infrastructure \nFacility 12  supported  the  development  of  a  10-year,  $211  million,  national  infrastructure \ninvestment  plan  that  embedded  strengthened  disaster-resilient  principles  into  broader \ndevelopment investments, and was endorsed by the cabinet in April 2015.13 The plan identified \npriority infrastructure investments, estimated to cost $57.8 million, that are designed to reduce \nand manage disaster and climate risks, including risk mitigation measures. \n \n10.  In 2015, ADB conducted a macroeconomic assessment (footnote 5) and recommended \nthat the government \u201ccontinue to build up its resilience and readiness to natural disasters and \nexplore financial options to support its cash position in the event of a disaster.\u201d14 By putting in \n                                                \n8  Payouts under PCRAFI are determined parametrically based on the assessed severity of a specific disaster. \nPayouts commence with events of a 1-in-10-year severity; less severe events do not attract a payout. \n9  Government of the Cook Islands, Office of the Prime Minister, Central Policy and Planning Office. 2016.

The design of the proposed PBL is based on the World Bank\u2019s catastrophe deferred \ndrawdown option (Cat DDO), which is linked to a development policy loan.15 Although ADB does \nnot have such a financing modality, the provision of financing contingent on a disaster with an \noption to defer loan drawdown is similar to the precautionary financing option in ADB\u2019s policy on \nPBLs.16 A PBL has been selected as the preferred lending modality as it is the only instrument \ncurrently available that will enable financing to be put in place before a disaster strikes. All other \ninstruments,  including  emergency  assistance  loans,  are  processed  only  after  a  disaster \nhappens. Eligibility to access PBL financing is linked to the achievement of prior and continuing \nactions to strengthen disaster resilience, which is similar to the Cat DDO. \n \n12.  Important lessons learned from the World Bank\u2019s development policy operations with \nCat DDOs have been taken into consideration in designing the proposed PBL to the Cook \nIslands, including:17 \n(i)  Disaster contingent financing is most effective as part of a broader disaster risk \nfinancing program, complementing other risk retention tools and risk transfer \ninstruments. The  primary  benefit  of a  deferred  drawdown  is that  it  is quick-\ndisbursing,  providing  the  government  with  an  immediate  source  of  bridge \nfinancing following a disaster. \n(ii)  For the government to fully benefit from the quick-disbursing nature of contingent \nfinancing, specific institutional arrangements need to be in place to enable the \nsubmission of a deferred drawdown request for funds post-disaster. \n(iii)  Fiscal impact studies can help the government understand its expected post-\ndisaster short-term recovery funding gap, which the contingent financing can help \nto close. \n(iv)  For DRM policy frameworks with multiple action areas across different sectors, a \ndialogue should be initiated with various line agencies during project preparation \nand  implementation.  Stakeholders,  including  line  agencies,  civil  society,  the \nprivate  sector,  and  academia,  can  contribute  to  DRM  through  their  regular \nprograms. \n(v)  Contingent credit is an affordable source of financing that complements existing \nmarket-based disaster risk financing instruments. Contingent credit can be used \nin combination with market-based disaster risk financing to retain the risk from \nsmaller, more frequent events, or to transfer the risk from less frequent, higher-\nimpact events, based on an assessment of risks, desired coverage, available \nbudget, and cost efficiency. \n(vi)  To optimize the timing and size of drawdowns, the soft trigger for disbursement, \nwhich is a standard feature of the Cat DDO instrument, needs to be supported by \nstrong analytics. \n                                                \n15 Since 2008, the World Bank has extended development policy loans with a Cat DDO to Colombia, Costa Rica, El \nSalvador, Panama, Peru, the Philippines, the Seychelles, and Sri Lanka. \n16 ADB. 2011.

Washington, DC. \n ", "5 \n(vii)  As a development policy loan, Cat DDOs provide the opportunity to elevate DRM \nissues to oversight agencies that may not otherwise be engaged in the policy \ndialogue, especially finance ministries. \n(viii)  The implementation of technical assistance to support the policy areas of the Cat \nDDO can facilitate substantive policy dialogue and effective implementation even \nafter full disbursement of the loan. \n \n13.  As the Cook Islands already has an effective public financial management (PFM) system \nin place and a stable macroeconomic environment, and has taken important actions to improve \nDRM, it is considered a suitable country to pilot a disaster-contingent financing approach.18 As a \nregular ordinary capital resources-only country, the Cook Islands does not have access to \nconcessional financing and has specifically requested disaster-contingent financing through a \nPBL. \n \n14.  Economic impact of the disaster resilience program. The program supports a series \nof actions to improve disaster readiness (para. 19). It will only be possible to quantify the full \neconomic impact of the program after a disaster, as the benefits or costs avoided will be \ndetermined by the scale of a disaster. However, the following are indicative of the economic \nbenefits that are expected to flow from the program: \n(i)  a reduction in lives lost and injuries incurred during a disaster, reflecting a wider \nunderstanding of what to do in case of an approaching disaster due to improved \ndisaster planning, response preparation, and public training; \n(ii)  reduced damage and losses to public and personal property due to (a) improved \ndisaster planning, response preparation, and public training; (b) better resilience \nthrough  improved  location,  design,  and  construction  of  critical  public \ninfrastructure and assets; and (c) a strengthened building code; \n(iii)  faster removal of debris and hazards with flow-on impacts for improved public \nsafety due to pre-contracting and improved availability of post-disaster finance; \n(iv)  faster restoration of essential services due to improved planning, financing, and \npre-contracting of specialized services, allowing for reduced public and private \ncosts through shorter business, office, and public facility closures; \n(v)  a  more  effectively  coordinated  humanitarian  response  providing  temporary \nshelter,  food,  water,  and  sanitation  with  a  reduced  risk  of  outbreaks  of \nwaterborne diseases and other negative post-disaster health impacts; \n(vi)  better targeted humanitarian responses and more efficient spending for recovery \nthrough more efficient development of damage and loss assessments; \n(vii)  rapid access to an increased balance in the disaster emergency trust fund, the \nPCRAFI insurance premium, and funds from the PBL, which will provide the \ngovernment with a larger pool of resources to finance its short-term, post-disaster \nneeds in a timely and cost-effective manner, and avoid the opportunity cost \nassociated with government budget or aid program reallocations, and/or any \nfinancial costs associated with additional commercial or concessional borrowing \nthat may be urgently needed to meet post-disaster costs; and \n(viii)  risk of corruption and unapproved or incorrect expenditures of government and \ndonor funds minimized through increased transparency and closer tracking of \npost-disaster expenditures. \n \n                                                \n18  Other developing member countries with access to ordinary capital resources funds in the Pacific (i.e., Fiji and \nPalau) have also indicated an interest in requesting similar support. \n ", "6 \n15.  Partner support. Established in 2013, PCRAFI provides developing member countries \nin the Pacific with disaster risk modeling and assessment tools, and supports dialogue on and \nfinancing for integrated financial solutions to reduce financial vulnerability to disasters and \nclimate change.19 The Cook Islands joined the PCRAFI insurance pilot in 2014, selecting a level \nof cover corresponding to a 1-in-10-year disaster\u2014the lowest level of cover with the least costly \npremium.20 \n \n16.  New  Zealand  provides  DRM  support  under  its  bilateral  aid  program  through  an \narrangement  with  its  Ministry  of  Civil  Defence  and  Emergency  Management.  The  Pacific \nCommunity is implementing Building Safety and Resilience in the Pacific, which is financed by \nthe European Union and implemented locally by Emergency Management Cook Islands. A \nsecond phase of PCRAFI is being rolled out as part of the World Bank\u2019s regional Pacific \nResilience Program. \n \n17.  ADB priorities and contributions. ADB priorities in the Cook Islands are guided by the \nPacific Approach, which serves as the country strategy for the 11 smaller developing member \ncountries in the Pacific.21 The approach focuses on a three-pronged strategy: reduce costs, \nmanage risks, and enable value creation. ADB\u2019s sector priorities in the Cook Islands are public \nsector  management,  energy,  information  and  communication  technology,  and  DRM.  ADB \nprovides a combination of investment projects, technical assistance, and policy-based lending to \nimprove development outcomes in these sectors. Planned ADB lending to the Cook Islands \nincludes projects for improving internet connectivity and renewable energy.22 \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n18.  The  disaster  resilience  program\u2019s  impact  is  aligned  with  the  objectives  of  the \ngovernment\u2019s National Sustainable Development Plan (footnote 9) to strengthen resilience to \ncombat the impacts of climate change and natural disasters, and build resilient infrastructure. \nThe outcome will be adverse economic and social impact of disasters reduced. \n \nC.  Outputs \n19.  The government has successfully accomplished 12 vital prior actions to improve disaster \nresilience,  which  are  presented  in the  policy  matrix.23 These  actions  provide  the  basis for \nestablishing eligibility to access contingent credit provided through the proposed PBL. A post-\nprogram monitoring framework has been agreed with the government to further strengthen DRM \nperformance. The program has three outputs: \n \n(i)  Output 1: Policy and institutional arrangements for DRM strengthened. In \n2016, the cabinet approved the National Sustainable Development Plan, 2016\u2013\n2020 (footnote 9), which includes two specific objectives: to strengthen resilience \nto  combat  the  impacts  of  climate  change  and  natural  disasters,  and  to  build \nresilient infrastructure. Public consultations on a second joint national action plan \n                                                \n19  PCRAFI is a joint initiative of the Pacific Community, through its Applied Geoscience and Technology Division, the \nWorld Bank, and ADB, with the financial support of the Government of Japan and the Global Facility for Disaster \nReduction and Recovery. \n20  The maximum insurance payout to the Cook Islands for a 1-in-10-year attachment point is about $2.9 million. \n21 ADB. 2016.

DRM plans covering arrangements \nand responsibilities for local governments and communities\u2014a critical first line of \ndefense in responding to disasters\u2014have been prepared for the 10 Pa Enua (outer \nislands) and are being prepared for the 10 punas (local government districts) of \nRarotonga.  The  government  is  ensuring  that  regular  meetings  of  the  National \nDisaster Risk Management Council take place, with their frequency increased to \nonce  per  quarter  by  the  end  of  2017,  in  compliance  with  the  DRM  Act.  The \ngovernment has taken steps to improve public awareness of disaster risks through \nthe preparation of DRM learning modules for schools, which were first distributed in \n2014 and will be further disseminated in 2017; and the development of training \nmodules, targeting key areas of DRM accountabilities relevant to each government \nagency, that will be disseminated in 2017.  \n \n(ii)  Output 2: Disaster resilience of physical assets improved. The government \nhas obtained information from registered contractors on the availability and price of \nservices and goods for post-disaster cleanups, such as debris removal, and the \nrestoration  of  essential  services,  including  power  and  water.  The  National \nInfrastructure  Investment  Plan  has  been  prepared  that  identifies  priority \ninfrastructure needed to increase resilience, including risk mitigation measures \n(footnote  13).  The  government  has  also  put  in  place  a  requirement  that  all \nproposals for public investment projects over NZ$150,000 include an assessment \nof disaster and climate risks. In 2017, the government will further enhance this \nrequirement by designing and implementing a dedicated screening tool for disaster \nand climate risks. Preparations are underway for a revised building code, which will \ninclude specific standards for improving the disaster resilience of public and private \nassets, with cabinet endorsement expected in 2017. \n \n(iii)  Output 3: Disaster risk financing expanded. To bolster the fiscal buffers for \ndisaster response, the government established the disaster emergency trust fund \nand purchased disaster insurance coverage under PCRAFI. To further expand \ndisaster risk financing, the government has committed to continue to increase \nfunding for the trust fund and pay the annual insurance premiums for PCRAFI \ncoverage. The proposed PBL will provide a critical additional and complementary \nlayer, currently absent, for disaster risk financing, which will further increase the \ngovernment\u2019s overall fiscal buffers, enabling the country to better respond to and \nbetter cope with the impact of disasters. \n \nD.  Development Financing Needs \n \n20.  Financing needs for post-disaster response and recovery provided under the PBL have \nbeen determined based on (i) the likely fiscal impact of a 1-in-10-year disaster, taking into \naccount the resources likely available from domestic and international sources; (ii) the likelihood \nof a drawdown during effectivity of the loan; (iii) the need to ensure that the country maintains a \nsustainable level of debt; and (iv) costs associated with the continued implementation of actions \ncontained in the policy matrix (footnote 23). As the proposed PBL is for contingent financing to \nsupport additional public spending associated with short-term post-disaster financing needs \nsuch as debris removal, restoration of key public services, and other priority expenditures that \nthe government may determine based on the severity of a disaster, there is no direct correlation \nbetween the loan amount and the cost of policy reforms as is the case with typical PBLs. \n ", "8 \n \n21.  The government has requested a loan of NZ$13.95 million from ADB's ordinary capital \nresources to help finance the program. The loan will have a 15-year term, including a grace \nperiod of 3 years, with repayments calculated based on a disbursement-linked amortization \nschedule,  an  annual  interest  rate  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB's  London  interbank \noffered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.15% per year, and such \nother terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement.  \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n22.  The Ministry of Finance and Economic Management is the executing and implementing \nagency, supported by key government agencies, including the Office of the Prime Minister, \nEmergency  Management  Cook  Islands,  and  Infrastructure  Cook  Islands.  The  cabinet  will \nprovide  overall  strategic  guidance.  Individual  policy  actions  form  part  of  existing  sector \nstrategies that will continue to be discussed with the private sector and civil society groups \nduring program implementation. \n \n23.  The program will be implemented up to 31 December 2019. It is designed to give \noperational flexibility in delivering disaster-responsive financing to the Cook Islands. Eligibility to \nwithdraw loan proceeds will be based on the achievement of prior actions in the policy matrix; \nhowever, actual withdrawals would be deferred and only triggered in the event of an official \ndeclaration of a state of disaster by the government, as defined in DRM Act, 2007. Following a \ndisaster, but prior to submitting a withdrawal request, the government will consult with ADB to \nensure that the size of the requested withdrawal is consistent with the scale of a disaster. \nDuring loan effectivity, ADB will periodically monitor the continuing implementation of the agreed \npolicy actions, according to the post-program monitoring framework (footnote 23). Based on the \navailability of country program resources, ADB\u2014in consultation with the government and other \nstakeholders\u2014will provide technical assistance to support the strengthening of DRM actions, \nincluding activities to improve disaster preparedness and reduce disaster risk. \n \n24.  Loan proceeds will be withdrawn following ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2015, \nas  amended  from  time  to  time).  A  disbursement-linked  repayment  schedule  will  be  used. \nDepending on the assessed severity of a disaster, the government may choose to drawdown \nonly a part of the available program funds.24 A specific repayment schedule based on the size of \nthe drawdown and the remaining, unutilized funds will be calculated. \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Economic and Financial \n25.  The  envisaged  reform  impacts  include  (i)  a  clearer  DRM  policy  and  institutional \narrangements that will improve the country\u2019s preparedness for and response to disasters, (ii) the \nimproved resilience of public and private physical assets to withstand the impact of disasters, \nand (iii) larger fiscal buffers to meet financial needs during the immediate aftermath and early \nrecovery period of a disaster. Taken together, the policy actions will improve the ability of the \nCook Islands to better withstand and cope with the short- and longer-term impacts of disasters. \n \n                                                \n24 This is a similar arrangement to that used for the Public Expenditure Support Facility Program for Indonesia, which \nused installments under a single tranche (footnote 2). \n ", "9 \nB.  Governance \n26.  The government is finalizing an updated PFM road map for 2016\u20132020 that builds on the \npositive progress analyzed in the 2012 and 2015 public expenditure and financial accountability \nassessments.  The  road  map  will  include  further  improvements  to  financial  management \nlegislation and tighter fiscal responsibility ratios in relation to debt targets, cash balances, and \npersonnel expenses. In 2016, the Ministry of Finance and Economic Management initiated the \nfeasibility stage of procuring a single PFM information system, which will streamline financial \nmanagement practices across the government. A public sector strategy has been released, \nwhich focuses on three areas of public service performance: people, systems, and structures.25 \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed with \nthe government and the Ministry of Finance and Economic Management. \n \nC.  Poverty and Social \n27.  Policy  actions\u2014based  on  three  outputs  designed  to  strengthen  DRM  policy  and \ninstitutional arrangements, improve structural resilience, and expand disaster risk financing\u2014will \nallow the government to maintain greater fiscal stability in the event of a disaster and enable the \ngovernment to initiate relief and recovery efforts with minimum delay, mitigating the immediate \neconomic and social impacts. Implementation of the policy actions is expected to continue to \nstrengthen social protection arrangements that are already in place, ensuring communities and \nvulnerable households, including households headed by women, are able to reach safety in the \nevent of a disaster, have access to sufficient relief supplies to meet their immediate needs, and \nreceive support to rebuild their lives and assets. The PBL is classified some gender elements, \nwith positive poverty and social impacts through stronger DRM that will equally benefit both \nwomen and men, and the collection of sex-disaggregated data to better monitor the impacts of \nand response to disasters. \n \nD.  Safeguards \n28.  In line with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the PBL is classified category C \nfor the environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples. Program activities will be \nconfined to policy and institutional reforms, and none of the activities will result in or lead to \ninvoluntary resettlement, nor will they negatively affect indigenous peoples or the environment. \nStakeholder  dialogue  was  carried  out  during  the  program  design  and  will  continue  during \nprogram implementation. \n \nE.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n29.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 3 and described in detail \nin the risk assessment and risk management plan.26 PFM systems are assessed as strong and \ngenerally able to support effective public service delivery. The remaining fiduciary risks will be \naddressed through policy reforms and technical assistance. The integrated benefits and impacts \nof the program are expected to outweigh the costs. \n \n                                                \n25 Government of the Cook Islands. 2016.
