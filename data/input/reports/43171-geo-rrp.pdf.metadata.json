The environmental concerns will \nAssessment  be addressed through the environmental assessment and review \nframework agreed with the Municipal Development Fund of Georgia \n(MDF). \n   \nProject Description  The proposed Municipal Services Development Project - Phase 2 \n(MSDP  2)  finances  investments  in  municipal  infrastructure  and \nutility  services.  It  focuses  on  urban  transport,  but  could  flexibly \nrespond to other municipal infrastructure. It will provide (i) proceeds \nto MDF for financing to selected municipalities for repairing and \nrehabilitating municipal infrastructure and local utility services, and \n(ii)  capacity  development  for  MDF  and  municipalities  through \nincremental administration and technical assistance programs. \n \nThe MSDP 2 follows the Municipal Services Development Project \n(MSDP 1) approved in August 2008. It targets high-priority urban \ntransport projects in Tbilisi and other municipalities, which were \nproposed for additional Asian Development Bank (ADB) financing \nunder the MSDP 1. As available financing under the MSDP 1 is \nlargely  committed  to  other  priority investments,  a  new  facility  is \nproposed.  \n   \nRationale  The double shocks of the August 2008 conflict with the Russian \n  Federation and the global economic crisis undermined growth and \nstability in Georgia. Investor and consumer confidence deteriorated \nand liquidity in the banking system contracted, while infrastructure \nwas  left  damaged.  Investment  and  economic  development \ndeclined and foreign direct investment slowed. This stressed the \nbalance  of  payments,  shrank  public  finances  from  revenue \nshortfalls, and increased expenditure needs.  \n \nEconomic  growth  has plunged  from  10.0%  in  2007  to  2.1%  in \n2008. The Georgian authorities responded with macroeconomic \npolicies,  but  the  GEL2.2  billion  stimulus  has  limited  municipal \nfunding.  \n \nChallenges  in  the  urban  transport  sector  are  palpable.  Tbilisi ", "ii   \nsuffers from traffic congestion, and air and noise pollution. This is \ndue to increased private car ownership, inadequate roads, and the \ndeteriorating public transport systems including discontinuing tram \nand trolleybus services. About 80% of air pollution derives from \nmotor transport. Road accidents have increased, with over 4,000 \nreported in Tbilisi in 2007, and a 62% increase in the number of \npeople injured in 5 years.  \n \nTherefore, the Government requested ADB to urgently support a \nprogram of investments in Tbilisi's municipal transport systems, \nincluding roads, traffic management, and public transport.  \n \nThe MSDP 2 will finance MDF, an effective agency, for improving \nmunicipal transport systems. The Project is technically feasible, \ninstitutionally sound, and economically viable. This new facility: \n \n(i)  supports government and ADB priorities; \n(ii)  responds swiftly to the Government\u2019s request; \n(iii)  complies  with  a  mutually  defined  development \nframework; \n(iv)  capitalizes on the proven MDF arrangements; and \n(v)  reinforces  ADB\u2019s  long-term  partnership  in  urban \ndevelopment with Georgia. \n   \nImpact and Outcome  The MSDP 2 will improve the urban environment, local economy, \nand  public  health  in  urban  areas.  The  projected  outcome  is \nimproved municipal infrastructure and service delivery and better \nliving conditions. The outputs are (i) increased quality of service, \nwider  network  coverage,  efficient  and  reliable  urban  services \nparticularly  for  urban  transport  and  traffic  management;  and \n(ii) improved capacity of municipalities and MDF. \n \nInvestment Plan   The investment cost of the Project is estimated at $41.50 million \nincluding  taxes  and  duties  of  $5.97  million;  physical  and  price \ncontingencies, and financing charges during implementation. \n   \nFinancing Plan   \nTotal  \nSource  ($ million)  % \nAsian Development Bank  30.00  72.28 \nMunicipal Development Fund  3.00  7.23 \nMunicipal Governments  6.61  15.92 \nCentral Government  1.89  4.57 \n  41.50  100.00        \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates subject to  \nadjustments during project implementation. \n \n  ADB  will  provide  a  $30  million-equivalent  loan  from  the  Asian \nDevelopment Fund (ADF) hard-term facility. The ADF financing has \na 32-year term, including a grace period of 8 years, and an interest \ncharge of 1.6% per annum.  \n ", "    iii\n \nAllocation and  The Government will make the ADB loan available to MDF on a \nRelending Terms  nonrefundable basis. It will then be passed on to eligible municipal \ngovernments as a combination of loans and grants or grants to the \nmunicipalities,  which  have  limited  or  zero  capacity  to  borrow. \nEstablished  eligibility  criteria  for  borrowing  are  based  on  the \ncreditworthiness of each municipal government.  \n \nExcept  as  otherwise  agreed,  loans  from  MDF  to  municipal \ngovernments  will  be  in  lari  and  will  be  repayable  in  the  same \ncurrency over a period of up to 10 years, including a grace period of \nup to 1.5 years to cover the construction period. MDF will charge \n12% interest on these loans to include provisions for credit defaults, \nthe cost of MDF administration and other operational expenses, and \na margin of profit.  \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  Until 30 June 2014 \n   \nEstimated Project  31 December 2013 \nCompletion Date   \n   \nExecuting Agency  Municipal Development Fund of Georgia (MDF) \n   \nImplementation  MDF will be both the implementing and the executing agency. MDF \nArrangements  has  been  effectively  contracting,  managing,  and  monitoring \nmunicipal  projects  funded  by  institutions  such  as  the  European \nBank  for  Reconstruction  and  Development  (EBRD),  German \ndevelopment cooperation through KfW, the Millennium Challenge \nCorporation, and the World Bank.  \n \nMDF is experienced and competent, with a good track record. The \nPrime  Minister  heads  its  supervisory  board.  Since  1997,  about \n900 municipal and regional projects have been implemented. \n   \nProcurement  Procurement  activities  will  follow  ADB's  Procurement  Guidelines \n(2007, as amended from time to time). Contracts for civil works \nabove  $1  million  equivalent,  and  contracts  for  goods  above \n$500,000 equivalent will be procured using international competitive \nbidding. Civil works contracts costing $1 million equivalent or less, \nand contracts for goods costing between $100,000 and $500,000 \nequivalent, will be carried out through national competitive bidding. \nGoods contracts less than $100,000 equivalent will be carried out \nthrough shopping procedures. Goods valued below $10,000 and \ncivil works valued up to $10,000 may be purchased directly from the \nsupplier and contractor.  \n   \nConsulting Services  Selecting and engaging consultants will follow ADB\u2019s Guidelines on \nthe  Use  of  Consultants  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time): \n(i) quality- and cost- based selection; (ii) quality-based selection; \n(iii) consultants\u2019  qualifications  selection  for  small  consultancy \nassignments  less  than  $200,000  per  contract;  (iv)  least-cost \n ", "iv   \nselection  for  very  small  consultancy  assignments  less  than \n$100,000;  (v)  fixed  budget  selection;  and  (vi)  single  source \nselection and ADB individual consultant selection procedures for \nindividual national or international consultants for assignments such \nas  environmental,  social,  tariff,  and  operation  and  maintenance \nstudies. \n   \nProject Benefits and  The  MSDP  2  will  directly  benefit  people  and  businesses. \nBeneficiaries  Investments  in  urban  transport  will  improve  people  mobility  and \nhealth, and increase the livability of the city. They will improve traffic \nflow and air quality, reduce traffic accidents, increase tourist interest \nand protect the city heritage.  \n \nIf relevant, investments in water supply and waste management will \nimprove health and living conditions through safer and more reliable \nwater,  improved  environmental  waste  water  treatment  through \nbetter sewerage and solid waste management services, and saving \ntime when collecting water.  \n \nThe  target  investments  will  reduce  municipal  infrastructure \noperation  and  maintenance  costs.  They  will  create  jobs  during \nconstruction and rehabilitation. Training and technical assistance \nwill increase municipal and MDF capacity and productivity. \n   \nRisks and  Potential risks include (i) municipal governments\u2019 inability to provide \nAssumptions  counterpart  funding  and  operation  and  maintenance  funds,  and \n(ii) MDF capacity shortage caused by an increasing portfolio. \n \nThese risks can be mitigated, as MDF ensures proposed projects \nhave  sufficient  counterpart  contribution  and  operation  and \nmaintenance  funds.  Incremental  administration  and  project \nmanagement are included to support capacity weakness. ADB will \nmonitor these risks and propose any corrective measures.  \n \n ", "41 o 00'E 45 o 00'E\nR U S S I A N     F E D E R A T I O N GEORGIA\nMUNICIPAL SERVICES DEVELOPMENT PROJECT--PHASE 2\nBzyb R.\nGagra N\nABKHAZETI\nPitsunda\nOmarishara\nGudauta Lata Kodori R.

THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto Georgia for the Municipal Services Development Project - Phase 2 (MSDP 2). The design \nand monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n2.  Over the past 5 years, Georgia has implemented far-reaching strategic reforms and \ndevelopment initiatives with impressive results. Widespread anticorruption measures and deep \nstructural reforms helped improve public administration and establish strong mechanisms of \naccountability and transparency. Reforms have cut across all areas of government. Reforms in \ntax, customs, and the regulatory environment helped develop a dynamic and competitive private \nsector as the main engine of growth, with state support providing basic public goods and \nservices. Such a strong record of reforms in Georgia led to rapid economic growth of 10.5% \nduring 2005\u20132007. A key driver of this growth has been substantial inflows of foreign direct \ninvestment, amounting to $1.5 billion (15% of gross domestic product) in 2007. \n \n3.  The double shocks resulting from the August 2008 conflict with the Russian Federation, \nand  the  ongoing  global  economic  crisis,  undermined  growth  and  stability.  Investor  and \nconsumer  confidence  deteriorated,  liquidity  in  the  banking  system  contracted,  and \ninfrastructure was left damaged. Investment and economic development declined and foreign \ndirect investment slowed. This stressed the balance of payments and shrank public finances \nfrom revenue shortfalls, and increased expenditure needs. Economic growth has plunged from \n10.0%  in  recent  years  to  2.1%  in  2008.  The  Georgian  authorities  responded  with \nmacroeconomic  policies,  but  the  GEL2.2 billion  stimulus  has  limited  municipal  funding. \nInvestments and upgrade of existing services depend on available resources. Therefore, the \nGovernment  sought  financial  support  to  boost  the  economy,  energize  local  activities,  and \ngenerate employment\u2014focusing on the urban transport sector. \n \n4.  Georgia\u2019s urban population has remained stable at about 2.3 million, about 52% of the \ntotal, from 2000 to 2006.1 Estimates for 2015 indicate little change. Most population movements \nhave been from smaller towns to larger urban centers, rather than from rural to urban areas. \nToday,  government  investment  focuses  on  rehabilitating  basic  infrastructure  because  of \n(i) stabilizing  urban  population,  and  (ii)  neglected  investments  in  infrastructure  assets  and \nmaintenance. Urban areas have inadequate water supply and waste water system, inefficient \nsolid  waste  management,  and  poor  public  transport.  Appendix  2  presents  urban  sector \nproblems.  \n \n5.  In  December  2008,  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  approved  a  $40  million-\nequivalent  loan  for  the  Municipal  Services  Development  Project  (MSDP  1),  through  the \nMunicipal Development Fund of Georgia (MDF). Its scope covers water supply, waste water \nsystem, and municipal roads in remote cities. This financing helps upgrade 40-year-old urban \nwater supply systems and maintain road networks. Since 2009, MDF has rapidly designed \nsubprojects and awarded contracts. To date, 21 subprojects worth $11.1 million have been \napproved.  The  award  for  planned  contracts  for  2009  is  $7.86  million,  indicating  a  141% \n                                                 \n \n1   ADB. 2007. Key Indicators 2007: Inequality in Asia. Manila. \n ", "2   \nachievement  above  projections  (Appendix  3).  MDF  is  following  the  project  administration \nmanual (PAM) approved by ADB, and has proven itself a committed and efficient development \npartner. \n \n6.  Several urgent urban transport projects were not included in the list of the MSDP 1 but \nits resources are now more than 70% committed to the existing pipeline of subprojects. Thus, a \nnumber of priority investments cannot be financed. These investments will help resolve heavy \ntraffic  congestion,  air  and  noise  pollution,  caused  by  increased  private  car  ownership, \ninadequate roads, weak traffic management, and deteriorating public transport services.  \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n7.  Tbilisi represents more than 25% of Georgia's population but generates nearly 50% of \nthe country\u2019s gross domestic product. The city extends 170 square kilometers (km2), with a \n1,200 km road network. With 1.34 million people and a density of 7,900 inhabitants per km2, \nTbilisi manifests all the typical problems in metropolitan areas: poor air quality, excessive noise, \ntraffic congestion, loss of green areas, and degraded historical buildings and monuments. The \nhistorical  pattern  of  the  city\u2019s  development,  and  its  resultant  form,  partially  explains  this \nsituation. The urbanized area forms a reverse \u201cS\u201d shape, squeezed between the Mtkvari River, \nthe Metekhi Cliff, and the Saguramo Range, which concentrates all infrastructure and traffic flow \ninto a single corridor. The result is a bottleneck and heavy congestion at peak traffic periods.  \n \n8.  Increased  private  car  ownership,  triggered  by  high  economic  growth,  has  recently \nexacerbated the problem. In 2007, car ownership reached 120 cars per 1,000 inhabitants, \nnearly doubling the number since 2002 and resulting in time-consuming traffic jams, a spike in \nroad accidents, and increased environmental pollution. About 80% of air pollution derives from \nmotor transport, compounded by deficient traffic management and poorly maintained vehicles. \nIn 2007, 4,000 accidents were reported, representing a dramatic 63% increase in people injured \nand killed in 5 years. Therefore, a \u201cglobal\u201d citywide strategy that focuses on all elements of the \nurban transport system is needed\u2014strengthened by complementary \u201cpush and pull\u201d (coercive \nand incentive) measures. \n \n9.  Public transport services deteriorated because of poor road conditions, management \ndeficiencies among operators, and insufficient investments in fleet renewal and infrastructure \nupgrades. Today, Tbilisi\u2019s urban transport network comprises a two-line metro system, 123 bus \nroutes, and 60 microbus routes operated by public and private companies. Microbuses convey \nthe bulk of daily passengers, holding a 60% market share, while the balance is split evenly \nbetween public buses and the metro system. Combined, they represent 400 million passenger-\ntrips annually.  \n \n10.  Through  the  European  Bank  for  Reconstruction  and  Development  (EBRD)  and  the \nDutch bilateral assistance, city authorities upgraded the fleet with new and secondhand buses, \nand offers better service with affordable fares. Private operators began to complement the \ndeficient public transport network with a system with a flexible and frequent microbus service, \nwhich covers most the city. The use of electric transport\u2014trams and trolleys\u2014declined in terms \nof  ridership,  and  in  November  2006,  the  city  government  discontinued  their  networks  as \npassengers  shifted  to  microbuses.  In  September  2006,  to  reduce  road  congestion,  the \nGovernment started to ban minibuses from main avenues\u2014replacing them with larger, more \nefficient buses. The number of minibuses in operation fell from 4,500 to 2,000 but the number of \nthe buses is still not sufficient to cope with existing demand.  \n \n ", "    3 \n11.  Tbilisi is pursuing a number of initiatives to improve urban transport, road and traffic \nmanagement, parking, and the public transport ticketing system. It is now exploring options for \nexpanding an existing asset\u2014the metro network. Serving 250,000 passengers daily, the metro \nnetwork is poised to play a stronger role in the urban transport system and can serve as the \nbackbone of the city\u2019s network. A first phase is planned to extend the line to the university \ndistrict, where a large population of students and high traffic flows exist. Parking was contracted \nthrough an auction to a foreign company\u2014ParkCity\u2014in January 2009. In February 2009, to \npromote intermodal use of public transport, a $7 million integrated ticketing system for the bus \nand metro networks was instituted, using Czech technology and financing from the Bank of \nGeorgia.  \n \n12.  Another priority in Tbilisi is to decongest the right bank of the Mtkvari river, particularly \nthe Gorgasali street section. This main transit road artery, located on the edge of the old city, \nneeds redesigning and reconstructing to segregate transit traffic from local traffic. A four-lane \ntunnel, parking lots, landscaped gardens, and access to the city\u2019s historical district is proposed. \nTechnical detailed design is ongoing; the project should be completed within 18 months. This \nproject may be one of the first subprojects submitted for financing under the MSDP 2, following \nestablished submission and review procedures. \n \n13.  The development partner community has been supportive to the country\u2019s urban sector. \nThe World Bank financed transport assistance to Tbilisi municipality, focusing on a road safety, \ntraffic management, parking policy, public transport strategic planning, and action plan. Some \nrecommendations on parking management and traffic improvements have been implemented. \nIn 2008, the World Bank directed 20% of its $40 million Regional and Municipal Infrastructure \nProject loan for improvement of urban roads. The EBRD has also partnered with Georgian \ncities, investing in fleet renewal\u2014particularly in the Tbilisi bus company in 2005 ($4 million) and \nin Batumi in 2008 ($2.5 million). The EBRD, the International Finance Corporation, and the \nGeorgian Reconstruction and Development Company are involved in the renovation of Tbilisi \ncentral railways.  \n \n14.  The Government\u2019s request for financing for urban transport and municipal services \nproject is consistent with ADB\u2019s interim operational strategy for the country.2 ADB\u2019s strategies \nfor Georgia are to (i) improve service delivery in municipal infrastructure within the evolving \ndecentralization process, (ii) reduce road transportation constraints on economic activity, and \n(iii)  upgrade  and  develop  energy  infrastructure.  In  the  urban  sector,  ADB  is  focusing  on \n(i) sector reforms for sustainability of infrastructure assets, (ii) strengthening financing local \ninfrastructure, (iii) stimulating local economic development, and (iv) improving the quality of life \nof the urban population. \n \n15.  As with the MSDP 1, the MSDP 2 will adopt the financial intermediation loan modality to \nmeet government constraints and project requirements.3 MDF is not a financial institution. The \n                                                 \n \n2  ADB. 2008. Interim Operational Strategy (2008\u20132009): Georgia. Manila. \n3 The traditional forms of ADB intervention in the urban sector are the project loan, sector loan, and sector \ndevelopment program loan modalities. None of these lending models satisfied government constraints and the \nrequirements of the Project. As for the MSDP 1, the Project has adopted the financial intermediation loan modality \nas the best fit. However, standard ADB financial intermediation loan requirements (the participation of eligible \nfinancial institutions and commercial entities as well as relending and onlending arrangements) are not applicable. \nThis approach was preferred as it is in line with ADB\u2019s urban sector strategy, which advocates using a greater \nvariety of lending modalities given the rapidly changing context of financial markets. This will also contribute to \npromotion of development effectiveness by harmonizing ADB assistance with that of its partners and with country \n ", "4   \nGovernment has been using MDF (a special purpose vehicle, the sole purpose of which is to \nprovide funds to municipalities on a grant or a mix of loan and grant basis) to finance the \nrehabilitation of dilapidated urban infrastructure. MDF is not a commercial entity. Since its \nestablishment in 1997, MDF has been operating as a project implementation and disbursing \nagency for funds provided under foreign-assisted and locally funded projects. To sustain its \ngrowth, MDF started also financing project from its own sources. MDF has the experience and \nnecessary  capacity  for  identifying,  appraising,  selecting,  implementing,  and  monitoring \ndevelopment subprojects under well-established rules, policies, and procedures. \n \n16.  End recipients of the ADB funds are not commercial entities. The Government needs to \nprovide scarce public resources to a wide range of municipalities, including those with limited \nborrowing capacity. The municipal governments are not commercial entities and they do not \nhave access to commercial finance. The Project will provide additional working capital to MDF \nto ensure it continues to meet the investment needs of municipal governments. This is the \ncurrent practice in Georgia and has been proven an effective mechanism for providing municipal \ngovernments with affordable long-term credit and the recovery of such investments. \n \n17.  This approach will not distort financial markets. ADB loan proceeds will be provided by \nthe Government to MDF entirely on a non-refundable basis. The loan proceeds will then be \nonlent or ongranted to end users at below market rates. However, this will not distort the \nfinancial markets, as the end users under the Project do not have any access to commercial \nfinancing.  Due  diligence  of  development  subprojects  to  be  financed  under  the  investment \ncomponent will be carried out by MDF in accordance with established rules and procedures. \n \n18.  The potential risk associated will be the difficulty for MDF to simultaneously deal with \nsignificant  number  of  projects.  This  will  be  mitigated  through  the  capacity  development \ncomponent that will assist development of MDF\u2019s long-term vision, corporate strategy, and \nrevised business model.   \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \n19.  The  proposed  financing  is  primarily  required  to  finance  urban  transport  and  traffic \nmanagement interventions identified by Georgian municipalities and to respond flexibly to other \nmunicipal infrastructure priorities. The indicative list of urban transport subprojects under the \nMSDP 2 is in Appendix 4. \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n20.  The impact of this new facility is to improve the urban environment and public health, \nand  invigorate  local  economies  in  urban  areas.  The  outcome  will  be  improved  municipal \ninfrastructure,  service  delivery,  and  better  living  conditions.  It  aims  to  promote  economic \ndevelopment by financing urban transport and traffic management measures to (i) improve air \nquality  and  reduce  noise  pollution,  (ii)  improve  access  to  businesses  and  communities, \n(iii) improve the fluidity and capacity of the city road network to reduce travel costs and time to \nmajor commercial and service centers, and (iv) enable citizens to tap economic and social \nopportunities. It will support the Government\u2019s efforts to enhance economic growth. \n  \n                                                                                                                                                          \n \npriorities and systems. The World Bank has adopted a similar approach in Georgia under its three loans to MDF \n(Municipal Development and Decentralization Project I, II and III) that has proven to be effective. \n ", "    5 \n21.  To  support  the  flexibility  and  responsiveness  of  the  MSDP  2,  a  number  of  urban \nmunicipal subsectors are proposed for possible financing. These include urban transport, water \nsupply, wastewater, and solid waste management\u2014all of which might be financed directly or \nindirectly under the MSDP 2. Reflecting this open and flexible scope, the design and monitoring \nframework includes targets and indicators for all of the above subsectors.  \n \nB.  Outputs \n22.  Outputs include increased quality of service, wider network coverage, efficient and \nreliable urban services, particularly for urban transport and traffic management, and improved \ncapacity  of  municipalities  and  MDF.  The  MSDP  2  also  aims  to  rehabilitate  and  replace \ndeteriorated equipment and works, and improve municipal services management.  \n \n23.  To achieve outputs, and in support of longer-term devolution, the MSDP 2 will focus on \nenhancing the capacity within MDF and municipal governments to (i) improve financial plans \nand  manage  projects,  (ii)  establish  mechanisms  for  system  repair  and  maintenance,  and \n(iii) move MDF towards a more sustainable municipal financing institution. These basic policy \ndirections are unlikely to change, and are expected to be reflected in Georgia\u2019s future urban \nsector strategy.  \n \n24.  The  MSDP  2  also  includes  technical  assistance  to  help  participating  municipal \ngovernments identify their urban priorities; undertake planning and projects feasibilities; and \nimprove  charges,  accounting,  financial  management,  and  reporting  systems.  It  provides \ninstitutional strengthening and capacity development to the municipal governments to ensure \nsustainable project benefits. \n \nC.  Project Investment Plan \n25.  The project investment cost is estimated at $41.50 million including taxes and duties, \nphysical and price contingencies and financing charges during implementation of $7.41 million. \nA summary of the cost estimates is in Table 1, and detailed cost estimates are in Appendix 5. \nTable 1: Project Investment Plan \n($ million) \nItem    Amounta\nA.

Financing Plan \n26.  The Government has requested a $30 million loan from the Asian Development Fund \n(ADF) hard-term facility. The ADF financing has a 32-year term, including a grace period of \n8 years, and interest charge of 1.6% per annum. \n27.  The Government and the municipal governments will finance $11.50 million (27.72%). \nThe financing plan is summarized in Table 2, and detailed in Appendix 5. \nTable 2: Financing Plan \n($ million) \nSource  Total  % \nAsian Development Bank  30.00  72.28 \nMunicipal Development Fund   3.00  7.23 \nMunicipal Governments  6.61  15.92 \nCentral Government  1.89  4.57 \n  41.50  100.00 \n  Source: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n28.  The Government will make the proceeds of the ADB loan available to MDF on a \nnonrefundable basis. Under the investment component, ADB loan proceeds will be passed on \nto  eligible  municipal  governments  (Appendix  6).  There  will  be  two  financing  windows:  (i) \ncombination of loans and grants to the financially stronger municipalities of Georgia that have \nthe capacity to borrow, and (ii) grants to the financially weaker municipal governments that \nhave limited or zero capacity to borrow. \n29.  Under window 1, MDF will require that a minimum of 20% of the subproject cost be \ncontributed by a municipal government, and will finance the balance as a loan and a grant; \n50% of a subproject cost will be financed by a loan from MDF, and 30% as a grant from MDF. \nMDF will finance about 24% of the loan portion under window 1 from its own resources. Under \nwindow 2, 85% of a subproject cost will be financed by a grant from MDF and the remaining \n15% will be a contribution by the municipal government. ADB loan proceeds will be used to \nfinance all grants portions and 76% of the loan portion. It is estimated that about $17.24 million \nof the ADB loan will be allocated to window 1, with the remaining to window 2. \n30.  About 80% of capacity development component costs will be financed by MDF using \nthe ADB loan and the balance from the central Government. Based on the current practice, \n85% of the incremental administration4 cost of MDF will be financed by ADB, and the balance \nby central government. The Government will finance the interest during construction for both \nloans. \n31.  Except as otherwise agreed, subloans from MDF to municipal governments will be in \nlari and will be repayable in the same currency over a period of up to 10 years, including a \ngrace period of up to 1.5 years to cover the construction period. MDF will charge interest of \n12% on these loans to include provisions for credit risks (defaults), cost of MDF administration \nand other operational expenses, and a margin of profit.  \n                                                 \n \n4 Incremental administration finances temporary staff, studies, and expertise. \n ", "    7 \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Project Management \n32.  Executing Agency. As structured in the MSDP 1, MDF will be the executing agency \nresponsible for overall implementation, monitoring, and disbursement for MSDP 2. MDF was \nestablished in 1997 under Presidential Decree No. 294. MDF is a government-owned entity, \noperates its own accounts, and prepares independent financial statements. MDF was set up to \nstrengthen the institutional and financial capacities of municipal governments by financing local \ninfrastructure investments and capacity development projects. MDF disburses loans and grants \nto municipal governments using funds from international financial institutions and governmental \nagencies. Since 2002, MDF has generated its own revenue from loan repayments by municipal \ngovernments and is now relending some of these funds. \n33.  A financial management assessment of MDF was undertaken. Based on the balance \nsheets and income statements projected for 2008\u20132018, MDF has sufficient cash to support \nthe required contributions to the Project, and continues to be profitable. MDF\u2019s strategic plan \nwas completed in 2008 and should be approved at the next board meeting scheduled for mid-\n2009. This strategic plan forms the basis of a business plan with a long-term vision. The \nobjective is a financially sustainable MDF, which over time will become less dependent on \ndevelopment partner financing.  \n34.  Implementing Agency. MDF will be the implementing agency. With a multidisciplinary \norganization of 107 experienced specialists, it has performed well, has capacity for project \nimplementation, and is currently recruiting staff to absorb new project load. Details of MDF are \nin Appendix 7. \n35.  Existing project implementation arrangements will remain the same and are detailed in \nthe  PAM  of  the  MSDP  1.  This  PAM  was  adopted  by  MDF  as  the  operations  manual  in \nDecember 2008. It includes policies and procedures to be followed during implementation of \nthe Project. It describes the rules and procedures governing MDF business activities and MDF \nrelations with its clients under MSDP 2 financing. \n36.  Eligible Municipal Governments. All municipal governments within Georgia are likely \nto be eligible to participate in the Project (Appendix 8). \n37.  Eligible  Investment  Projects.  The  list  of  subprojects  which  inter  alia  may  be \nconsidered for funding under the MSDP 2 is in Appendix 4. Once these projects have been \nfinanced, the remaining funds may be used for any of the following subsectors: (i) water supply, \nincluding resource development and improvement; (ii) sewerage collection and treatment; (iii) \nwaste water system and solid waste collection and disposal; (iv) local road improvement, \nincluding drainage and street lighting; (v) traffic management and public transport; and (vi) \nother  municipal  services.  Subprojects  for  other  categories  may  be  considered  by  prior \nagreement  with  ADB.  Only  subprojects  meeting  general  eligibility  criteria  (Appendix  8), \nincluding ADB safeguards, will be eligible for financing under the MSDP 2. \n38.  Pooling of smaller but related and contiguous projects may be allowed to meet the \nminimum investment requirement.  \n39.  Investment Project Preparation and Appraisal. The investment project cycle follows \nthat of MDF and comprises \n ", "8   \n(i)  preliminary review of the proposal; \n(ii)  feasibility work; \n(iii)  appraisal by MDF of the proposed investments; \n(iv)  financial proposal and request for approval by the MDF supervisory board; \n(v)  signing of investment financing agreement with the municipal government; \n(vi)  procurement and implementation of the subproject; and  \n(vii)  monitoring and evaluation.  \n \n40.  Appraisal of investment projects by MDF will be undertaken on the basis of quantitative \nand qualitative criteria defined in the operations manual and will cover technical, financial, \neconomic, environmental, social, and institutional aspects. This will rationalize acceptance or \nrejection for financing by MDF. The appraisal report for any subproject exceeding $2 million will \nbe sent to ADB for approval on a no-objection basis. The detailed steps for preparation and \nappraisal of subprojects and necessary studies to be prepared are in Appendix 9. \n2.  Implementation Period \n41.  This facility will be implemented over 5 years from 2009 to end of 2013 (Appendix 10). \nThis is considered realistic because the project implementation structure is already in place and \npreparatory works, including the operations manual, are underway. \n3.  Procurement \n42.  All procurement financed under the Project will follow ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines \n(2007, as amended from time to time). Contracts for civil works of more than  $1 million \nequivalent and contracts for goods more than $500,000 equivalent will be procured using \ninternational  competitive  bidding  procedures.  Civil  works  contracts  that  cost  $1  million \nequivalent or less, and contracts for procurement of goods between $100,000 and $500,000 \nequivalent, will be carried out through national competitive bidding. The national competitive \nbidding will be conducted in accordance with ADB guidelines and as indicated in section C of \nthe procurement plan (Appendix 11). \n43.  Goods contracts less than $100,000 equivalent will be carried out through shopping \nprocedures. Goods and civil works valued up to $10,000 may be purchased directly from the \nsupplier  and  contractor.  In  such  cases,  ADB  should  be  satisfied  that  the  price  paid  is \nreasonable. The award of all contracts will be subject to prior approval by ADB, except small \ncontracts under the shopping and direct contracting procedures. Experience under the other \nprojects implemented by MDF shows that it is able to handle procurement effectively and in a \ntimely manner. Because of the nature of the Project, the scope of individual subprojects will be \nknown only during project implementation. However, estimates of required goods, works, and \nservices  have  been  carried  out  and  a  preliminary  procurement  plan  has  been  prepared \n(Appendix 11). This will be revised and updated annually or as needed throughout project \nimplementation. \n4.  Consulting Services \n44.  Selecting and engaging consulting services will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines \non the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time) and the procurement plan: \n(i) quality and cost-based selection; (ii) quality-based selection; (iii) consultants\u2019 qualifications \nselection  for  small  consultancy  assignments  that  cost  less  than  $200,000  per  contract; \n(iv) least-cost selection for very small consulting assignments that cost less than $100,000; \n ", "    9 \n(v) fixed  budget  selection;  and  (vi)  single  source  selection  and  ADB  individual  consultant \nprocedures for selection of individual national or international consultants for the following types \nof assignments: environmental, social, tariff, and operation and maintenance (O&M) studies. \n5.  Advance Contracting and Retroactive Financing \n45.  To facilitate project implementation, ADB Management approved, in principle, advance \ncontracting and retroactive financing to be utilized for eligible expenditures financed by under \nthe Project. Advance contracting allows the Government to commence procurement activities, \nat its own risk, prior to the signing of the relevant loan agreement. The Government was \ninformed that, in order for expenses incurred under advance contracting to be eligible for \nretroactive  financing,  such  procedures  (including  advertising)  must  comply  with  ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Guidelines and Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. Once the loan becomes \neffective,  up  to  20%  of  such  loan  proceeds  may  be  used  to  retroactively  finance  eligible \nexpenditures incurred during the period not exceeding 12 months prior to the signing of the loan \nagreement.  Alternatively,  the  Government  may  also  opt  for  advance  contracting  without \nretroactive financing, in which case, the procurement procedures completed under advance \ncontracting do not conclude with the award of contract until after the loan becomes effective. \nThe  Government  acknowledges  that  any  concurrence  by  ADB  with  the  procedures, \ndocumentation, or proposal for award does not commit to ADB to finance such expenses or the \nrelated project. \n \n6.  Anticorruption Policy  \n46.  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was  explained  to  and \ndiscussed with the Government and MDF. Consistent with its commitment to good governance, \naccountability, and transparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its \nagents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the Project. \nTo support these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the \nloan regulations and the bidding documents for the Project. In particular, all contracts financed \nby ADB in connection with the Project shall include provisions specifying the right of ADB to \naudit and examine the records and accounts of MDF and all contractors, suppliers, consultants, \nand other service providers as they relate to the Project. \n7.  Disbursement Arrangements \n47.  The loan proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement \nHandbook (2007, as amended from time to time). MDF, upon loan effectiveness, will establish \nand operate an imprest account for the MSDP 2 in the Treasury or a bank acceptable to ADB. \nThe imprest account will be exclusively used to finance the ADB share of eligible expenditures. \nThe imprest account will be established, managed, replenished, and liquidated in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook. The initial amount to be deposited in the imprest \naccount will not exceed the estimated project expenditures to be financed from the imprest \naccount for the next 6 months, or 10% of the loan amount, whichever is lower. To expedite \nfunds flow and simplify the documentation process, the statement of expenditures process will \nbe used for replenishment and liquidation of the imprest account and reimbursement of eligible \nexpenditures, not exceeding $200,000 per individual payment. The payment in excess of the \nstatement of expenditures ceiling will be reimbursed, liquidated, or replenished based on the \nfull supporting documentation process. \n ", "10   \n48.  To facilitate municipal governments' project implementation and disbursement, for the \nsubloan and grant from MDF to municipal governments in lari, ADB's subloan approval and \nwithdrawal procedure may be used. For a subproject in the amount not exceeding $2,000,000 \neligible for financing under the project financing facility component, the subloan approval and \nwithdrawal  procedure  may  be  used  in  accordance  with  the  ADB's  Loan  Disbursement \nHandbook, provided that a related subproject summary report is submitted together with the \nwithdrawal application in form and substance satisfactory to ADB.  For a subproject in the \namount equal to or exceeding $2,000,000 eligible for financing under the project financing \nfacility component, ADB's prior review and approval of the related subproject appraisal report \nand investment financing agreement will be required prior to disbursement in accordance with \nthe ADB's Loan Disbursement Handbook. \n \n8.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n49.  MDF will maintain a separate account for the Project acceptable to ADB. MDF will have \nits  account  and  financial  statements  (balance  sheet,  income  statement,  and  statement  of \nsources and application of funds) audited annually in accordance with sound and internationally \naccepted auditing standards by independent external auditors acceptable to ADB. MDF will \nsubmit to ADB, not later than 6 months after the close of each financial year, (i) its audited \nfinancial  statements;  and  (ii)  the  auditor\u2019s  report  relating  to  supplementary  information  on \nMDF\u2019s accounts, including an assessment of the quality of its long-term loans, the adequacy of \nthe provision for doubtful loans, and MDF\u2019s corporate and financial governance practices. A \nseparate  audit  opinion  on  the  use  of  the  imprest  account  and  statement  of  expenditures \nprocedures should be included in the audit report. Delay in submission of audited financial \nstatements of acceptable quality may result in ADB suspending loan disbursements. \n50.  MDF will provide ADB with (i) a biannual progress report on project performance within \n2  weeks  after  the  end  of  each  semester  that  will  include  information  on  the  loan  funds \nutilization,  subloans  and  grants,  procurement  activities,  and  other  matters  relating  to  the \nProject;  (ii)  a  projected  annual  disbursement  schedule,  broken  down  by  quarters  by \n15 December each year; (iii) a project completion report within 6 months of the loan closing \ndate detailing project implementation, project costs, subloan repayments, financial conditions of \nMDF, and other details that ADB may consider necessary; and (iv) updated 3-year financial \nprojections of MDF by 31 December each year. \n9.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n51.  MDF will ensure that a project management and information system is maintained at the \nstart of project implementation. This will help monitor and evaluate the technical performance \nand  social  and  economic  benefits  of  the  Project  at  6-month  intervals.  The  performance \nmonitoring indicators and procedures will be established, and revised as necessary. At the start \nof the Project, MDF, together with participating municipal governments will identify baseline \nindicators that focus on project municipal services delivery and financial capacity. \n52.  As part of the quality assurance process, ADB reserves the right to undertake random \nchecks on how ADB funds are managed and projects selected. \n10.  Project Review \n53.  Review missions will be undertaken twice a year for the first 2 years and once a year \nthereafter.  ADB  and  the  Government  will  undertake  a  midterm  review  after  project \n ", "    11 \nimplementation begins. This will include a detailed evaluation of the scope, implementation \narrangements,  and  progress  in  achieving  scheduled  targets,  and  compliance  with  loan \ncovenants.  Feedback  from  the  project  processing  monitoring  system  will  be  analyzed. \nIntermittent \u201cspot checks\u201d on the performance of MDF will also be undertaken to ensure all \nactivities under the ADB-financed program are in line with ADB\u2019s policies and guidelines, \nparticularly with respect to the environment and social safeguards. \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \nA.  Benefits and Impacts \n54.  The Project will directly benefit the municipal population in terms of health and living \nconditions  resulting  from  (i)  an  efficient, safer,  and  more  reliable  urban  transport  system; \n(ii) reduced congestion and better mobility between housing clusters and economic activities; \n(iii) improved living conditions with a cleaner environment and reduced noise; and (iv) improved \nroad conditions and reduced road accidents. The economies of these municipalities will also \nbenefit indirectly from enhanced productivity by attracting investors, improving health, and \nincreasing efficiency through improved roads and public transport. \n55.  The Project is also expected to (i) strengthen public trust in participating municipal \ngovernments by rehabilitating municipal infrastructure; (ii) improve access to urban transport \nservices by local populations, including the most vulnerable groups (women, children, and poor \nhouseholds);  (iii)  increase  employment  opportunities 5  after  the  rehabilitation  of  local \ninfrastructure; and (iv) increase participation and ownership by municipal governments and \ncommunities.  \n56.  Rehabilitating systems will lead to significant savings in municipal infrastructure O&M \ncosts and more efficient O&M procedures. The Project will also have a positive impact on \nemployment creation from the work involved in construction and rehabilitation, together with \nO&M. Training and technical assistance under the Project will enhance the productivity of \nmunicipal governments and MDF personnel.  \n57.  The Project will benefit MDF and increase its exposure to structuring projects and ADB \noperations. Project support for coordination and implementation will increase the capacity of \nMDF to manage fund flows and specialist services to municipal governments. As MDF\u2019s project \nportfolio grows, some additional training and technical assistance in financial management is to \nbe provided to turn MDF into a more sustainable municipal financing entity. \n58.  The  Project  will  benefit  municipalities  through  the  provision  of  loans,  grants,  and \ntechnical assistance. The Project reinforces the role of local participation that will enhance \naccountability and transparency. It will help build capacity at the local level by providing hands-\non training and specialist advice. \n59.  Economic Analysis. The economic analysis framework prepared and used for the \nMSDP 1 (Appendix 12) will continue to be used for the MSDP 2. All subprojects to be financed \nunder the Project are required to demonstrate an expected positive economic outcome in line \nwith ADB\u2019s guidelines on economic analysis.6 This framework covers the scope of economic \nanalysis, quantifiable benefits expected from each type of investment, identifiable externalities, \n                                                 \n \n5 About 200\u2013300 jobs will be generated by the urban transport projects financed under the MSDP 2. \n6 ADB. 1997. Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects. Manila.  \n ", "12   \nand methodologies for conducting the economic analysis. It is incorporated into the operations \nmanual to guide the economic analysis of each subproject.  \n60.  Resettlement and Indigenous Peoples. As for the MSDP 1, the MSDP 2 will only \nfinance projects entailing the repair, rehabilitation, construction or modernization of existing \nfacilities and infrastructure that do not require land acquisition or resettlement. The ADB policy \non involuntary resettlement will not be triggered by this project.  \n61.  As there is no group fitting the ADB definition of indigenous peoples in Georgia, the \npolicy will not be triggered by the MSDP 2. The selection criteria for the contractors for civil \nworks in the projects will include strict adherence to the applicable labor laws and regulations of \nGeorgia.  \n62.  Environmental  Aspects.  The  Project  is  designed  to  maximize  environmental  and \npublic health benefits. The MSDP 2 net environmental benefits are positive, including better \npublic health, reduced exposure to suspended particles, reduced exposure to noise pollution, \npreservation of cultural heritage, improved access to employment opportunities, and reduced \nflooding through drainage improvements.  \n63.  The  negative  environmental  impact  during  construction  and  operation  will  not  be \nsignificant because construction will be planned by phase, with a specific temporary traffic plan. \nMost  projects  will  actually  divert  and  regulate  traffic,  and  simple  technologies  with  low \nmaintenance requirements will be selected when possible. However, exceptions may be made \nto include some environmentally sensitive investments if well justified. \n64.  A detailed description of the environmental assessment and review framework for the \ninvestment  subprojects  is in  Appendix  13.  For  each  investment  subproject,  MDF  and  the \nmunicipal governments will be responsible for applying the prescribed framework prepared in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Environmental  Assessment  Guidelines  (2003)  and  covering \nenvironmental  screening,  classification  (using  ADB\u2019s  rapid  environmental  assessment \nchecklists), assessment and implementation of the environmental management plan (EMP) \nthat  ensures  that  adverse  impacts  are  minimized  and  mitigated.  MDF  and  the  borrowing \nmunicipal governments will conduct the environmental monitoring in accordance with the plans \nand schedules outlined in the EMP. The monitoring results will be included as part of the \nprogress report and submitted to ADB on a semiannual basis. \n65.  Consultation and Civil Society. The main stakeholders will be MDF, participating \nmunicipal governments, communities, and civil society organizations. MDF and participating \nmunicipal governments will ensure that for all subprojects, the results of social assessments \nand stakeholder consultations will be adequately taken into account in identifying investment \npriorities. Consultation will be carried out through public hearings, surveys, workshops, and \nother meetings during project implementation and monitoring. \n66.  MDF will be responsible for undertaking and providing adequate resources for project \nmonitoring, including social development outcomes. The assessment of social issues cannot \nbe completed until the start of subproject feasibility. MDF will ensure that a social assessment \nis carried out in cooperation with the participating municipality to (i) identify possible social \nissues, including gender, vulnerability, labor, affordability, and other social risks, if applicable; \n(ii) identify measures to avoid or minimize these risks; and (iii) ensure that the proposed \nsubproject is tailored to the needs and priorities of the participating community as identified \nthrough  the  consultation  process.  A  summary  poverty  reduction  and  social  strategy  is  in \n ", "    13 \nAppendix 14. \n \n67.  MDF and participating municipal governments will furthermore ensure that there is no \ndifferential payment between men and women for work of equal value, and no child labor will \nbe employed in the construction or maintenance activities. \nB.  Risks \n68.  The potential risks associated with the Project include (i) MDF unable to find skilled and \nexperienced staff to manage and monitor project implementation, (ii) municipal governments \nunable  to  provide  required  counterpart  contributions  for  MDF  investments,  and  (iii) \narrangements for the O&M of subproject assets not implemented effectively. \n69.  The Project includes measures to mitigate these risks. Incremental administration and \nproject management have been included to support MDF and finance temporary staff and \nexpertise. Financial eligibility criteria for participating municipal governments during preparation \nwill ensure counterpart contributions. For the latter risk, the capacity development component \nof the Project is designed to provide consulting services to cover legal and/or technical aspects \nof  O&M  planning  and  funding.  Any  risk  associated  with  overall  project  implementation  is \nmitigated by MDF\u2019s considerable experience in implementing internationally funded projects. \nMoreover, ADB review missions will monitor these mitigation measures and help to ensure \nsustainability of the Project. \nV.  ASSURANCES \n70.  In addition to the standard assurances, the Government and MDF have committed to \nthe following, which will be incorporated in the Project\u2019s legal documents: \n(i)  The  Government,  MDF,  and  the  participating  municipal  governments  will  make \navailable and release in a timely manner all counterpart funds necessary for project \nimplementation. \n(ii)  MDF  will  carry  out  the  Project  in  accordance  with  the  operations  manual.  The \nmodified  PAM  will  act  as  operations  manual,  which  covers  the  policies  and \nprocedures during project implementation. It describes the rules governing MDF \nbusiness activities and its relations with its clients and as they relate to project \nfinancing.  No  revisions  to  the  operations  manual  will  be made  effective  without \nADB\u2019s prior approval. \n(iii)  Subprojects to be financed under the Project will meet the eligibility criteria set forth \nin Appendix 8. \n(iv)  MDF will ensure that each investment project under the Project (a) is selected and \nappraised in accordance with the agreed eligibility criteria, and (b) carried out in \ncompliance  with  the  applicable  environmental  laws  and  regulations  of  the \nGovernment  and  ADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy  (2002).  Appraisal  reports  for  the \nsubproject estimated to cost more than $2 million will be submitted to ADB for \napproval. \n(v)  The environmental assessment and review framework (Appendix 13) will be followed \nin  conducting  environmental  assessment  of  subprojects  during  project \nimplementation. In this regard, MDF will screen and classify subprojects following the \nADB  agreed  checklist.  MDF  will  ensure  that  environmental  assessment  will  be \nconducted, and environmental management plan will be developed, as necessary. \nMDF will obtain necessary permits and approvals. The municipal governments will \n ", "14   \nprovide  the  necessary  logistical  and  technical  support  for  conducting  the \nenvironmental impact assessments (EIAs). MDF will submit the EIA for category A \nsubprojects  or  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE)  for  category  B  sensitive \nsubprojects to ADB for review and clearance. MDF will ensure that the subproject \nEIAs  and  IEEs  will  get  the  appropriate  Ministry  of  Environment\u2019s  review  and \napproval. MDF will ensure that the EMP will be included in bidding and contract \ndocuments  for  subprojects.  MDF  and  the  borrowing  municipal  governments  will \nconduct the environmental monitoring in accordance with the plans and schedules \noutlined in the EMP. The monitoring results will be included as part of the progress \nreport and submitted to ADB on a semiannual basis. \n(vi)  Each subproject will be implemented in accordance with sound administrative, social, \nenvironmental, and governance principles. \n(vii)  All subprojects under the Project will be carried out within the existing rights-of-way \nand no subprojects will involve any land acquisition and/or resettlement that would \ntrigger ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy (1995). Any subproject that involves \nland acquisition and/or resettlement will not be eligible for ADB financing. \n(viii)  Social assessment of subprojects will be carried out in a socially responsible manner \nseeking mitigation of any potential social risks. \n(ix)  MDF will annually update its medium-term strategic plans including action plans. \n(x)  All  contracts  financed  from  the  loan  proceeds  under  the  Project  will  include \nprovisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and examine project-related records \nand accounts of MDF, all contractors, consultants, and other service providers. In \nline with the principles of transparency, accountability and anticorruption, MDF will \nenhance and further develop its website to provide the public with information on the \nProject,  major  activities,  procurement  activities,  lists  of  participating  bidders  and \nconsultants, names of the winning bidders and consultants, basic details on bidding \nand recruitment procedures adopted, amounts of the contracts awarded, the list of \ngoods and/or services purchased, and their intended use. \n(xi)  MDF  will  ensure  that  the  project  management  and  information  system  will  be \nmaintained within MDF and each of the participating municipal governments. At the \nstart  of  the  Project,  MDF  together  with  participating  municipal  governments  will \nidentify baseline indicators that focus on project municipal services delivery and \nfinancial capacity.  \n \nVI.  RECOMMENDATION \n71.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and,  acting  in  the  absence  of  the  President,  under  the \nprovisions of Article 35.1 of the Articles of Agreement of ADB, I recommend that the Board \napprove the loan in various currencies equivalent to Special Drawing Rights 19,374,000 to \nGeorgia for the Municipal Services Development Project \u2013 Phase 2 from ADB\u2019s Special Funds \nresources, with an interest charge at the rate of 1.6% per annum; a term of 32 years, including a \ngrace period of 8 years, and such other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance \nwith those set forth in the draft Loan and Project Agreements presented to the Board. \n \n \nC.

Background \n1.  The Municipal Development Fund of Georgia (MDF) was established on 7 June 1997 by \nthe  Government  of  Georgia  under  Presidential  Decree  No.  294  (on  management  of  funds \ndesignated for the development of the municipal sector in Georgia) as a legal entity of public \nlaw. It was set up to implement the first Municipal Development and Decentralization Project \n(MDDP) financed by the World Bank. MDF\u2019s charter has been revised since then on a number of \noccasions, when new projects were negotiated or activities transferred.1 The latest revision was \nunder Presidential Decree No. 118 (on approval of the charter and the supervisory board of \nMDF) in 2005. \n \n2.  MDF operates in accordance with (i) its charter; (ii) the provisions of the Law on Legal \nEntity of Public Law of 28 May 1999; (iii) other laws, orders, and decrees; (iv) agreements of the \nGovernment and a number of international multilateral and bilateral financial institutions; and \n(v) its operations manual. MDF is a financially autonomous entity, operates its own special and \ncurrent accounts in a commercial bank, prepares independent financial statements, and has its \nown seal. Its head office is in Tbilisi and the financial year is from 1 January to 31 December. \n \n3.  The main responsibilities of MDF include (i) providing funds for development of municipal \ninfrastructure  and  services,  and  (ii)  strengthening  the  institutional  and  financial  capacity  of \nmunicipal governments. MDF functions as a project implementing agency for a number of \nforeign-assisted and locally funded projects. It accesses funds from multilateral and bilateral \nfunding bodies, international aid agencies, and central and local governments. Foreign funds are \nusually released to MDF through the Ministry of Finance on a non refundable basis in the \ncurrency of the financer. MDF onlends or releases these funds as grants in lari for capital \ninvestments  and  capacity  development  of  municipal  governments.  MDF  has  extensive \nexperience of, and considerable capacity for, project implementation. It has performed well in \nimplementing a number of foreign-funded projects. \n \n4.  MDF is a government institution. It is neither a commercial nor a development bank; it \nreceives  no  customers\u2019  deposits  and  receives  most  of  its  funds  as  grants  from  central \ngovernment and through collection of loan repayments from municipal governments. It has no \noutstanding long-term debts.  \n \nB.  Organizational Structure and Internal Management Procedures \n1.  Organization and Staffing \n \n5.  MDF is accountable to the Government through its supervisory board. Coordination and \noverall management of its activities is undertaken by the supervisory board appointed by the \nGovernment and chaired by the Prime Minister. The role and responsibilities of the supervisory \nboard are defined by Presidential Decree No. 210 dated 3 May 2002 and Presidential Decree \n                                                 \n \n1  For example, the charter was revised under Presidential Decree No. 210 of 3 May 2002 and No. 409 of \n24 September 2002 to implement the MDDP II. Under Presidential Decree No. 1027 of 6 December 2005, the \nGeorgian Social Investment Fund was merged with MDF. Presidential Decree No. 246 of 8 June 2006 added the \nnonproject grant funded by the Government of Japan. Later, under Presidential Decree No. 128 of 30 June 2006, \nthe Irrigation and Drainage Consumers Organizations Development Project was merged with MDF. \n ", "26  Appendix 7   \n \nNo. 409 dated 24 September 2002. The latest composition of the supervisory board has been \nprescribed in Government of Georgia Decree No. 269, dated 5 December 2007 with the prime \nminister as the chairperson and nine other members2 all of whom are appointed and dismissed \nby  the  President  of  Georgia.  MDF  is  headed  by  an  executive  director  who  reports  to  the \nsupervisory board and is supported by four senior managers of the departments of irrigation, \nsocial investment, investment and loans, and administration. MDF has a total of 107 staff and \nconsultants as of early March 2009. MDF aims to increase staff numbers as the number of \nprojects it is implementing increases. The present organization and staffing chart is shown as \nFigure A7. \n \n2.  Management Policies  \n6.  Management policies are set out in several operations manuals prepared for different \nprograms. For example, MDF has an operations manual for the World Bank-funded MDDP, the \nGeorgian Social Investment Fund (GSIF) Project, and the Regional Infrastructure Development \nProject of the Millennium Challenge Georgia Fund. MDF does not have a core operations \nmanual, so the project administration manual for the Municipal Services Development Project \n(MSDP I) has been adopted as operations manual for management of Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) funds.  \n \n7.  The  operations  manuals  are  comprehensive  documents  and  set  out  MDF\u2019s \norganizational structure and internal management procedures, covering a general overview of its \n(i)  activities;  (ii)  organizational  structure  and  staffing  plan;  (iii)  personnel  management \nprocedures,  involving  general  principles,  employment  contracts,  professional  responsibility, \nconflict of interest, and code of behavior; (iv) financial management; and (v) reporting. They also \ndetail MDF\u2019s activities and business procedures, including (i) the nature of business products; \n(ii) investment project financing and technical assistance financing; (iii) investment financing; \n(iv) eligibility  criteria  for  projects  and  entities;  (v)  project  preparation  cycle;  (vi)  project \nimplementation, covering procurement guidelines, implementation supervision, and monitoring \nand  evaluation;  and  (vii)  project  financial  management  focusing  on  special  accounts,  local \ncurrency accounts, and accounting procedures. \n \n8.  The Finance Department uses a well-drafted and comprehensive financial management \nmanual (updated January 2007). This outlines (i) the organizational management structure, \nroles, and responsibilities for financial management; (ii) the legal requirements for financial \nreporting, and internal regulations for things such as time sheets, vacation and sick leave, travel \nallowances, and vehicle expenses; (iii) flow of funds arrangements, including special account  \noperational procedures and flows of documents; (iv) budgeting procedures, including the time \nframe  and  responsibilities;  (v)  the  accounting  system  covering  objectives  and  principles, \naccounting policies and rules, loans, payroll processing, and a description of the computerized \naccounting system and the treatment of operational expenditures; (vi) financial reporting and \nmonitoring,  describing  reports  to  be  produced  and  their  frequency;  (vii)  internal  control \nprocedures that set out the principles, appropriate documentation of policies, separation of \nfunctions, fixed asset control, and pay and payroll matters; and (viii) external control, prescribing \nthe annual audit and selection of auditors, and the requirements of financers and the Georgian \nauthorities. \n                                                 \n \n2  These are (i) the ministers of finance, economic development, education and science, agriculture, and regional \naffairs; (ii) the head of the Committee for Agrarian Issues of the Parliament; (iii) the deputy ministers of finance and \nregional  affairs;  and  (iv)  the  executive  directors  of  the  Association  of  Young  Economists  (nongovernment \norganization representative) and of the Millennium Challenge Georgia Fund. \n   ", "     \nFigure A7: Organization and Staffing Chart of the Municipal Development Fund of Georgia \nSSuuppeerrvviissoorryy   GGoovveerrnnmmeenntt  ooff  GGeeoorrggiiaa\nBBooaarrdd PPrriimmee  MMiinniisstteerr\nEExxeeccuuttiivvee  DDiirreeccttoorr\nAAssssiissttaanntt  ooff  \nHHeeaadd  ooff  IInntteerrnnaall  AAuuddiitt\nEExxeeccuuttiivvee  \nIInntteerrnnaall  AAuuddiitt  SSppeecciiaalliisstt\nDDiirreeccttoorr\nMMaannaaggeerr  ooff  IIrrrriiggaattiioonn   MMaannaaggeerr  ooff  SSoocciiaall   MMaannaaggeerr  ooff  AAddmmiinniissttrraattiivvee  \nMMaannaaggeerr  ooff  IInnvveessttmmeenntt  aanndd  \nDDeeppaarrttmmeenntt IInnvveessttmmeenntt  DDeeppaarrttmmeenntt DDeeppaarrttmmeenntt\nLLooaann  DDeeppaarrttmmeenntt\nAAssssiissttaanntt  ooff  \nHHeeaadd  ooff  \nIInntteerrpprreetteerr AAssssiissttaanntt IInntteerrpprreetteerr AAssssiissttaanntt IInntteerrpprreetteerr AAssssiissttaanntt AAddmmiinniissttrraattiivvee  \nPPrrooccuurreemmeenntt  \nDDeeppaarrttmmeenntt  \nMMaannaaggeerr DDiivviissiioonn\nHHeeaadd  ooff  tthhee   HHeeaadd  ooff  tthhee  PPrroojjeecctt   HHeeaadd  ooff  tthhee  PPrroojjeecctt   HHeeaadd  ooff  IInnffoorrmmaattiioonn   PPrrooccuurreemmeenntt  \nAAssssoocciiaattiioonn  ooff   MMaannaaggeemmeenntt   MMaannaaggeemmeenntt  MMoonniittoorriinngg   TTeecchhnnoollooggyy  ((IITT))   CChhiieeff  SSppeecciiaalliisstt\nAAmmeelliioorraattiioonn  DDiivviissiioonn MMoonniittoorriinngg  aanndd   aanndd  EEvvaalluuaattiioonn  DDiivviissiioonn DDiivviissiioonn PPrrooccuurreemmeenntt  \nEEvvaalluuaattiioonn  DDiivviissiioonn SSeenniioorr  SSppeecciiaalliisstt\nCChhiieeff  SSppeecciiaalliisstt  \nPPrroojjeecctt  MMaannaaggeemmeenntt  CChhiieeff  \n((WWeesstt  GGeeoorrggiiaa)) PPrrooccuurreemmeenntt  \nSSppeecciiaalliisstt  ((22))\nIITT  SSeenniioorr  SSppeecciiaalliisstt SSppeecciiaalliisstt\nSSuuppppoorrtt  SSppeecciiaalliisstt  ((22)) PPrroojjeecctt  MMaannaaggeemmeenntt  \nPPrroojjeecctt  MMaannaaggeemmeenntt  SSeenniioorr  \nSSppeecciiaalliisstt  ((33)) HHeeaadd  ooff  \nCChhiieeff  SSppeecciiaalliisstt   SSppeecciiaalliisstt\nIITT  SSppeecciiaalliisstt  ((22)) FFiinnaanncciiaall  \n((EEaasstt  GGeeoorrggiiaa))\nPPrroojjeecctt  MMaannaaggeemmeenntt  SSppeecciiaalliisstt   DDiivviissiioonn\nSSuuppppoorrtt  SSppeecciiaalliisstt  ((33)) ((22))\nFFiinnaanncciiaall  aanndd  EEccoonnoommiicc   FFiinnaanncciiaall  aanndd  \nTTrraaiinniinngg  SSppeecciiaalliisstt AAnnaallyyssiiss  SSppeecciiaalliisstt EEnnvviirroonnmmeenntt  SSppeecciiaalliisstt PPuubblliicc  RReellaattiioonnss  SSppeecciiaalliisstt EEccoonnoommiicc  \nMMoonniittoorriinngg  SSppeecciiaalliisstt PPrroojjeecctt  EEvvaalluuaattiioonn  CChhiieeff   AAnnaallyyssiiss  \nSSppeecciiaalliisstt CChhaanncceelllleerryy SSppeecciiaalliisstt\nCChhiieeff   A\nHHeeaadd  ooff  TTeecchhnniiccaall   HHeeaadd  ooff  TTeecchhnniiccaall   HHeeaadd  ooff  TTeecchhnniiccaall  DDiivviissiioonn AAddmmiinniissttrraattiivvee  SSuuppppoorrtt   AAccccoouunnttaanntt pp\nOOffffiicceerr  ((33)) e\nDDiivviissiioonn DDiivviissiioonn n\nPPrroojjeecctt  MMaannaaggeemmeenntt  SSeenniioorr   AAccccoouunnttaanntt  ((33)) d\nPPrroojjeecctt  MMaannaaggeemmeenntt   SSppeecciiaalliisstt DDrriivveerrss  ((88)) ix 7\nSSppeecciiaalliisstt  \nWWoorrkk  SSuuppeerrvviissoorr  ((55)) WWoorrkk  SSuuppeerrvviissoorr  ((1111)) WWoorrkk  SSuuppeerrvviissoorr  ((66)) CClleeaanneerrss  ((44)) LLaawwyyeerr\nSource: Municipal Development Fund of Georgia.  2\n7\n \n ", "28  Appendix 7   \n \n  3.  Financial Management Assessment \n \n9.  A financial management assessment of MDF was undertaken using a questionnaire and \ninterview approach. It focused on the finance and internal audit departments. Supplementary \nAppendix C provides a summary of the assessment together with the completed questionnaire \nand details of each member of the finance and internal audit staff, key qualifications, experience, \nresponsibilities, and supervising arrangements. \n \n10.  The Finance Department of MDF is well run with qualified and experienced financial \nspecialists and accountants; staff turnover is low. The department is headed by the financial \nmanager who is assisted by four staff well versed in the procedures and reporting requirements \nof international funding agencies, including those of the European Bank for Reconstruction and \nDevelopment,  German  development  cooperation  through  KfW,  the  Millennium  Challenge \nGeorgia Fund, and the World Bank,. For example, for the MDDP II, the World Bank requires that \nannual financial statements be audited each fiscal year in accordance with the International \nStandards on Auditing and that a separate audit opinion is required for all. For the MDDP II, \nthese comprise (i) a summary of sources and uses of funds showing the World Bank and \ncounterpart funds, including contributions in kind, separately as of the end of each fiscal year; \n(ii) a summary of uses of funds by project activities (statement of expenditure detail) as at the \nend of each fiscal year; (iii) a balance sheet; (iv) a statements of expenditures withdrawal \nschedule for each fiscal year; and (v) a special account statement for each fiscal year. Annual \nfinancing statements for MDF comprise (i) a balance sheet as at the end of each fiscal period, \n(ii) an income statement for each fiscal year, (iii) a cash flow statement for each fiscal year, and \n(iv) a funds flow statement for each fiscal year. MDF has no difficulties in producing these \nreports on time. Each one of the funds run by MDF has separate accounts, and there is no \nmixing of funds. \n \n11.  The accounting system is computerized using an off-the-shelf software package from the \nRussian Federation. With the merger of the GSIF and the Irrigation and Drainage Community \nDevelopment  Project  subprojects  with  MDF  in  2006,  there  were  three  different  accounting \npackages in use.3 Late in 2006, MDF opted for one package, and from 1 January 2007 all \ndepartments have been using the latest version of 1C Accounting. Spreadsheet reports, using \ndata from the accounting system, however, are prepared for international agencies rather than \nbeing an output of the system. There is a written financial management manual that is regularly \nupdated, and MDF is currently updating it for 2009. Financial reports are prepared on time and \nare accurate; unconsolidated accounts for each project in 2008 were submitted to the auditor in \nmid-February 2009. \n \n12.  MDF uses commercial accrual-based accounting, has a standard chart of accounts, and \nreports according to the International Financial Reporting Standards. The accounts are audited \nannually by an external private auditing company, and for the past 3 years there have been \nunqualified audit reports. Adequate safeguards are in place to protect the integrity of data. MDF \nhas  no  cash,  except  for  small  amounts  as  petty  cash.  All  transactions  are  undertaken \nelectronically through bank transfers. There is an internal audit service comprising the head and \na procurement auditor. Annual budgets are prepared on time and approved by the supervisory \nboard. Monitoring of actual expenditures and budgeted allocations is undertaken monthly but \nbetter linkages are required between physical and financial targets. \n                                                 \n \n3 The Municipal Development Fund used Oris, the Irrigation and Drainage Community Development Project used a \nself-made system based on Cooper software, while the GSIF used an older version of 1C Accounting. \n   ", "    Appendix 7  29 \n \n13.  MDF is a project implementation and disbursement agency for funds of foreign-assisted \nand locally funded projects. It is neither a commercial bank nor a development bank, has no \ndeposits,  and  receives  all  of  its  funds  as  grants  from  the  central  Government.  It  has  no \noutstanding  debts.  Most  of  its  funds  are  passed  on  to  municipal  governments  as  grants, \nalthough it has provided some loans to creditworthy municipalities under the World Bank MDDP \nI and II projects.  \n \nD.  Programs, Loans, and Business Planning \n \n  1.  Major Programs \n \n14.  The objective of MDF is to support the strengthening of institutional and financial capacity \nof municipal governments by (i) investing financial resources in local infrastructure and services, \nand  (ii)  improving  on  a  sustainable  basis  primary  economic  and  social  services  for  local \ncommunities. It accomplishes this by financing local infrastructure investments and capacity-\ndevelopment projects. In 2004, MDF disbursed loans and grants of about GEL3.8 million; in \n2005 this increased to GEL23.5 million, and in 2006 to GEL70.3 million but in 2007 it decreased \nto GEL39 million. MDF estimates that GEL88.9 million was disbursed in 2008 (MDF is still \nfinalizing 2008 accounts) and that GEL89.5 million will be disbursed. Funds have been sourced \nfrom the Millennium Challenge Cooperation, the World Bank, and other international financial \nagencies. Since 2002, MDF has generated it own revenue from loan repayments by municipal \ngovernments and is now relending some of these funds. \n \n15.  The first major project of MDF was the World Bank-funded MDDP I that involved the \nfinancing  of  89  investment  projects.  The  MDDP  II  followed  and  provided  investments  and \nsupporting technical assistance to more than 20 municipal governments. In 2005, the GSIF \nmerged with MDF, expanding MDF\u2019s activities into social infrastructure rehabilitation. Under the \nGSIF  I  and  II,  rehabilitation  works  of  $29.3  million  were  carried  out,  largely  for  education \nfacilities. Both projects involve World Bank and German development cooperation through KfW \nfinancing. \n \n16.  Since  2005,  MDF  has  been  implementing  the  $60  million  Regional  Infrastructure \nDevelopment  Project  financed  by  the  Millennium  Challenge  Corporation.  This  includes \nrehabilitation works in water supply and reservoirs, and irrigation system improvements. The \nRegional Infrastructure Development Project is scheduled for completion in 2010. MDF, with the \nMinistry of Education and the Science Ministry, is also implementing the Education System \nRealignment and Strengthening Program 2, financed by a World Bank loan of $15 million. \nRecently, under the nonproject grant funded by the Government of Japan, $2 million equivalent \nwas allocated to MDF to finance the acquisition of equipment for basic infrastructure services by \nmunicipal  governments.  In  2006,  the  Irrigation  and  Drainage  Consumers  Organizations \nDevelopment Project was transferred to MDF. \n \n17.  MDF is currently negotiating with the World Bank for a further $10 million loan to finance \nthe extension of the MDDP II. The arrangements will be the same, where the World Bank \nfinances 60% of the project cost, and MDF and municipal governments equally finance the \nbalance. The total project cost is estimated to be $16.7 million and of this 40% ($6.7 million) will \nbe released as loans to municipal governments. It is expected that this project will start in mid-\n2008 and will be implemented over 3 years.    \n \n \n ", "30  Appendix 7   \n \n  2.  Operating Modality \n \n18.  Capital  investments  of  MDF  follow  a  clearly  defined  project  cycle  that  matches  the \nrequirements of international financing agencies. This investment project cycle comprises the \nfollowing steps: (i) preliminary review of the proposal and carrying out of required feasibility \nwork, (ii) approval by MDF of the proposed investments, (iii) preparation of a financial proposal \nand request for approval by the MDF supervisory board, (iv) procurement and implementation of \nthe Project, and (v) monitoring and evaluation. Project or financing agreements are entered into \nby MDF and the concerned municipal government; once a loan project is approved and final \ncosts are known, a formal loan agreement is signed. \n \n19.  MDF short-lists contractors or suppliers, requests bids, selects the winning contractor or \nsupplier, and approves and disburses progress payments. Municipal governments are involved \nthroughout this process and sign off on all contract approvals and payments. Participating \nmunicipal governments are required to pay their contribution to MDF before commencement of \nthe construction contract. Upon completion of each subproject, MDF turns over the assets to the \nconcerned municipal government for operations and maintenance and, where appropriate, sets \nup a loan account for repayment by the municipal government.  \n \n3.  Lending Operations \n \n20.  To date, MDF has provided loan to 18 municipal governments, and the outstanding \nbalances at 31 May 2008 was GEL27.9 million.3 Loans are not secured but payments are \nenforced through the legal system, if necessary. Penalties are charged for late payments at \n0.06% per day of arrears on the amount due.4 Collection rates are generally high. In cases \nwhere municipalities fell into arrears, or refused to pay back the loan, MDF took action to ensure \nthe loan is paid back. \n \n4.  Business Planning \n \n21.  MDF does not have an approved corporate or business plan, but undertook a planning \nexercise in January 2008. The output of this workshop was submitted to ADB and is the basis of \na business plan being prepared by MDF. The plan will modify the long-term vision for MDF, \ntargeting  a  more  financially  sustainable  entity.  Outline  strategies  will  be  refined  and  more \ncomprehensive financial projections prepared. Detailed action plans for the first 3 years of the \nplan period will be included. A draft of the business plan has been prepared and it will be \nsubmitted to ADB as soon as it is ready for circulation. \n \nE.  Financial Performance and Projections \n \n3.  Financial Performance \n22.  The latest available MDF financial statements are for the year 2007. The total assets of \nMDF as at 31 December 2007 were GEL42.3 million, decreasing from GEL44.5 million at the \nend of 2006 because of repayment of loans to municipalities.

MDF has no outstanding long-term debts, and has not \nborrowed.6 \n \n23.  Total  revenue  in  the  fiscal  year  of  2007  was  GEL5.0  million,  an  increase  over the \nGEL4.6 million for 2006. Interest income is the biggest source of revenue and it amounted to \nGEL4.6 million in 2007 against GEL4.5 million in 2006. When set against operating expenses of \nGEL1.2  million  in  2006  and  GEL1.8  million  in  2007,  there  was  a  net  profit  before  tax  of \nGEL3.2 million in 2007 and GEL3.4 million in 2006. This slight decrease in profit is the result of \nan increase in expenses, especially administration costs. \n \n24.  MDF has not prepared long-term financial projections, and the only forecasts of revenues \nand expenditures are made for the annual budget. Latest estimates for the 2008 budget indicate \ntotal expenditures of GEL88.9 million, of which 50% is for Millennium Challenge Corporation, the \nEuropean  Bank  for  Reconstruction  and  Development,  and  the  Irrigation  and  Drainage \nCommunity Development Project. Funding for 2008 is largely from grants7 and cofinancing \n(90.5%), but interest income and principal loan repayments are estimated to contribute 9.5% of \ntotal financing. The 2009 budget has been prepared.    \n \n2.  Projected Financial Statements, 2008\u20132018 \n \n25.  As part of the MSDP 1, financial projections were prepared with the assistance of MDF. \nThe results are summarized in Table A7.1 and show that MDF has sufficient cash to support the \nrequired  contributions  to  the  Project  and  it  realizes  an  annual  net  profit  over  the  period. \nSensitivity tests involving different capital investment programs and varying the grant\u2013loan ratios \nfor municipal government projects show that it is essential for MDF to undertake more lending so \nthat the interest earned continues to grow. Current lending programs are reaching completion \nand new ones are needed. \n \n26.  To  project  MDF\u2019s  financial  statements  (balance  sheets  and  income  statements),  a \ncomputer model was developed and tested. Projections were made from 2008 to 2018, using \nbase  data  as  supplied  by  MDF  that  supplemented  the  closing  account  balances  as  at \n31 December 2007.8 Financial statements for 2008 were projected through the input of the latest \n2008 budget forecast as provided by the head of the Finance Division. \n \n27.  The following were the key assumptions used to project the financial statements: \n \n(i)  Property, plant, and equipment. Future investments for computers, vehicles, \noffice equipment, and furniture were assumed to be GEL0.1 million in 2008 and \nbeyond but adjusted for inflation. \n(ii)  Investment program. Based on MDF\u2019s projections. \n(iii)  Salaries  and  other  operating  expenses.  Increases  in  salaries  of  7%  were \nassumed for 2009 to account for the changes in withholding taxes and for the \nnew staff to be hired for the ADB project. Thereafter, an annual rate of growth of \n3%  (half  the  inflation  rate)  was  assumed.  Other  operating  expenses  were \nassumed to increase at 5% per annum. \n                                                 \n \n6  To date, all proceeds of loans from international funding agencies have been released to MDF as grants and in local \ncurrency. \n7  Including the proceeds of foreign loans to the Government of Georgia, but released to MDF as grants. \n8 Those recorded in the Municipal Development Fund of Georgia, Independent Auditor\u2019s Report, Financial Statements \nfor the year ended 31 December 2007, September 2008. \n ", "32  Appendix 7   \n \n(iv)  Loan  repayments  from  municipalities.  Although  MDF  generally  has  100% \ncollection rates, some slippage has been introduced in the model and a collection \nrate of 95% was assumed. New loans were restricted to those under the ADB \nproject, the proposed new World Bank loan, and the nonproject grant funded by \nthe  Government  of  Japan.  All  of  these  were  phased  according  to  the  likely \ndisbursement plans for the projects. \n(v)  Inflation. An annual rate of 6% per annum from 2008 to 2018 was used. \n(vi)  Income tax. Calculated at 20% of net income for the year. \n \nF.  Conclusions \n \n28.  Past financial statements and projections show that MDF has adequate funds for its \noperations. Since 2004, MDF\u2019s current assets are about 5 times current liabilities, and there has \nbeen an annual profit. Loans made by MDF to municipal governments are being repaid, mostly \non time. Annual financial statements are externally audited by private auditors and MDF has \ndetailed operations manuals together with a comprehensive and updated financial management \nmanual. The operations manuals describe the organizational structure and internal management \nprocedures, the rules governing its business activities and its relations with its clients, mandatory \nreporting  requirements,  operating  procedures,  and  credit  and  risk  management  policies. \nFinancial procedures are specified in the financial management manual. The supervisory board \napproves loans to municipal governments and the terms and conditions\u2014interest rates and \nrepayment periods. The manuals and experience of ADB, the World Bank, and other foreign-\nassisted projects show that MDF has adequate policies, systems, and procedures to assess and \nmonitor the economic, social, and environmental impact of subprojects. \n \n   ", "   \nTable A7: Municipal Development Fund of Georgia, Actual and Projected Balance Sheets and Income Statements, 2004\u20132018 \n(GEL million) \n \nActual Projected\nBalance Sheet 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018\nASSETS\nCurrent Assets\nCash And Cash Equivalents      4.37      2.51       9.92      10.23    11.41    12.86     18.67      19.05    2 1.80     27.55    32.18     37.16    3 9.33    41.20    4 2.89\nCurrent Portion of Loans to      1.97      2.30       2.92        3.65      4.17      4.75       4.84        4.36      5 .32       5.93      5.96       3.90      4 .23      4.74      5 .32\nMunicipalities\nOther Current Assets      0.08      2.91       2.85        3.31      5.05      5.69       6.62        6.26      3 .39       2.24      0.93       0.40      0 .19      0.11      0 .07\nTotal Current Assets      6.43      7.72     15.70      17.18    20.63    23.29     30.13      29.68    3 0.51     35.72    39.06     41.46    4 3.75    46.04    4 8.29\nNon Current Assets\nProperty, Plant And Equipment, Net      0.05      0.06       0.56        0.56      0.52      0.49       0.44        0.40      0 .36       0.31      0.26       0.20      0 .14      0.08      0 .01\nLoan to Municipalities, Noncurrent\nPortion\nADB Project          -       -         -       0.37        2.33      5 .03       6.92      8.37       8.17      7 .38      6.49      5 .49\nOthers    14.98    22.52     28.27      24.64    20.61    19.76     23.57      30.22    3 7.11     34.65    29.25     26.00    2 2.37    18.30    1 3.74\nSubtotal    14.98    22.52     28.27      24.64    20.61    19.76     23.94      32.55    4 2.14     41.56    37.62     34.18    2 9.75    24.78    1 9.23\nTotal Noncurrent Assets    15.03    22.58     28.83      25.20    21.14    20.24     24.38      32.95    4 2.50     41.87    37.88     34.38    2 9.89    24.86    1 9.23\nTOTAL ASSETS    21.46    30.31   44.52    42.38  41.77  43.54   54.52     62.63   73.01   77.59  76.94   75.84   73.64  70.90   67.52\nNET ASSETS AND LIABILITIES\nCurrent Liabilities\nRetentions On Project Expenditure      0.13      0.90       3.15        1.82      2.07      2.68       4.45        4.20      2 .67       2.67      1.82       1.82      1 .82      1.82      1 .82\nPayables        -      0.52       0.83        0.17      1.23      2.36       5.98        5.76      3 .17       2.51      1.16       0.79      0 .54      0.37      0 .21\nOther Current Liabilities      0.03      0.03        -           -       -         -        -           -        -         -        -        -         -        -        -\nTotal Current Liabilities      0.16      1.46       3.98        1.99      3.31      5.05     10.43        9.97      5 .84       5.18      2.98       2.61      2 .36      2.19      2 .04\nAccumulated Surplus\nNet Project Funds and Expenditures    15.24    21.68     32.36      29.71    25.51    23.75     27.52      34.27    4 5.98     48.00    46.64     43.62    3 9.94    36.12    3 2.14\nand Reserves\nRetained Earnings      6.05      7.17       8.18      10.68    12.95    14.74     16.57      18.39    2 1.19     24.41    27.32     29.61    3 1.34    32.60    3 3.34\nTotal Accumulated Surplus    21.29    28.85     40.54      40.40    38.46    38.49     44.09      52.66    6 7.17     72.41    73.96     73.23    7 1.28    68.71    6 5.48\nTOTAL NET ASSETS     21.46    30.31   44.52    42.38  41.77  43.54   54.52     62.63   73.01   77.59  76.94   75.84   73.64  70.90   67.52\nAND LIABILITIES    21.46    30.31   44.52    42.38  41.77  43.54   54.52     62.63   73.01   77.59  76.94   75.84   73.64  70.90   67.52  \n                 Note: Latest available Municipal Development Fund of Georgia statements are for 2007; 2008 is based on MDF budget projections.  \n         Source: Municipal Development Fund of Georgia.    \n \nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nix\n 7\n \n3\n3\n \n ", "34  Appendix 8   \n \nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR INVESTMENT SUBPROJECTS \n \nA.

Investment Project Preparation and Appraisal \n \n1.  Preparation and appraisal of an investment project by the Municipal Development Fund \nof Georgia (MDF) will involve the steps discussed below. \n \n2.  Step 1. The participating municipal government applying for the financing of a specific \ninvestment project submits a request to MDF for financing, together with a project summary, the \nform of which will be provided in the operations manual to be prepared by MDF.  \n \n3.  Step 2. MDF reviews the financing request with a view to determining whether \n \n(i)  the proposed subproject is consistent with MDF financing principles; \n(ii)  the applying municipal government is eligible for funding under window 1 (loan\u2013\ngrant cofinancing combination) or window 2 (grant cofinancing combination); \n(iii)  the  applying  municipal  government  has  the  necessary  borrowing  capacity  if \nfunding is to be under window 1; \n(iv)  documentation available for the subproject is sufficient for preparation of the \nsubproject summary report (SSR); \n(v)  the  proposed  project  will  require  any  land  acquisition  and  involuntary \nresettlement;1 and \n(vi)  the proposed project will have significant adverse environmental impacts or be \nclassified environmental category A (determined using the rapid environmental \nassessment  checklists  in  the  Asian  Development  Bank  [ADB]  Environmental \nAssessment Guidelines (2003).  \n \n4.  Step  3. The proposed subproject will be deemed unsuitable for MDF financing if it \nrequires any land acquisition and involuntary resettlement. If the project is deemed unsuitable \nfor MDF financing, MDF notifies the municipal government of the rejection of the request. \n \n5.  Step  4.  MDF  prepares  the  SSR  for  financing  window  2  subprojects  and  the  SSR \nprovides information on (i) a short description of the proposed subproject; (ii) an investment plan \n(amount of the proposed investment and structure); (iii) a financing plan (subloan amount, \nterms, grant, amount, and cofinancing need); (iv) a description of all possible benefits; and \n(v) implementation arrangements. \n \n6.  Step 5. For window 1 subprojects,2 MDF prepares the subproject appraisal report (SAR). \nIf documentation is deemed insufficient to prepare the SAR, MDF agrees with the municipal \ngovernment on the scope, terms of reference, implementation conditions, and schedule of \nrequired feasibility, design, and other complementary studies and assessments required for \nproject  appraisal.  The  SAR  provides  information  on  (i)  the  scope  of  the  subproject; \n(ii) investment  and  financing  plans;  (iii)  environmental  screening;  and  (iv)  environmental, \neconomic, financial, social, and other benefits and risks. To provide the information, the SAR \nshould answer the following questions: \n \n                                                 \n \n1  ADB defines involuntary resettlement as social and economic impacts that are permanent or temporary and are \ncaused by (i) acquisition of land and other fixed assets, (ii) change in the use of land, or (iii) restrictions imposed on \nland as a result of an ADB operation. \n2   Estimated to cost $2 million and more. \n   ", "Appendix 9  37 \n \n(i)  Have  the  possibilities  to  address  the  problem  in  different  ways  been  given \nadequate consideration and discussed with the population? \n(ii)  What has been the MDF experience with similar projects? \n(iii)  Is the municipal government capable of providing the 20% contribution to project \nfinancing up front? \n(iv)  Is the municipal government capable of making the loan repayments? \n(v)  Will the municipal government ensure sustainable operation and maintenance \nafter the proposed investment?  \n(vi)  Who are the beneficiaries of the project (in qualitative and quantitative terms)? \n(vii)  Has an environmental assessment been carried out and, if necessary, have \nadequate impact mitigation measures been identified and incorporated into the \ndesign and cost of the project?  \n(viii)  Does the proposed project conflict with any other ADB safeguard policy? \n(ix)  Is the technical solution proposed adequate and does it comply with Georgian \nlaws and regulations? \n(x)  Is the proposed project part of a larger investment program for the same area, \nand if so, how does it fit into that program for technical aspects, costs, and \nimplementation schedule and how will the other elements of the program be \nfinanced? \n(xi)  Are the preparatory studies (including final design studies and other documents) \nrequired for project execution of a quality and completeness sufficient to evaluate \nthe technical and financial feasibility of the project, and will allow its subsequent \nimplementation, or are complementary studies required? \n(xii)  Is the technical quality of the documents consistent with standard engineering \npractices? \n(xiii)  Are the cost estimates reliable and do they allow determination of the project cost \nwith a reasonable degree of certainty? \n(xiv)  Are the implementation time estimates realistic? \n(xv)  What are the tangible and intangible benefits of the project?

Are the results allowed to \nmake valid judgment in line with ADB\u2019s guidelines on economic analysis?3 \n \n7.  Step 6. If the SAR or the SSR is accepted by the MDF supervisory board, MDF sends it \nto ADB. \n \n8.  Step  7.  MDF  prepares  an  investment  financing  agreement  and  forwards  it  to  the \nmunicipal government for review. The agreement for the subproject that requires the SAR will \nbe prepared upon ADB\u2019s no-objection to the SAR. MDF signs the agreement with the municipal \ngovernment.  \n \nB.

Introduction \n \n1.  Because  of  the  lending  modality,  it  is  not  possible  to  determine  in  advance  the \nmunicipalities that will be participating in the Project, nor the investment projects for which these \nmunicipalities will ultimately request Municipal Development Fund of Georgia (MDF) financing. \nTherefore, a  quantitative  economic  analysis  for  the  Project  cannot be  done  at  the  project \nappraisal stage.  \n \n2.  This economic analysis framework is prepared in accordance with the guidelines for the \neconomic analysis of projects of the Asian Development Bank (ADB),1 to guide the economic \nanalysis to be conducted for each subproject in conjunction with a feasibility study during project \nimplementation. The framework covers the scope of economic analysis, quantifiable benefits \nexpected  from  each  type  of  investment,  identifiable  externalities,  and  methodologies  for \nconducting the economic analysis.  \n \nB.  Rationale for Government Intervention \n \n3.  The rationale for government intervention results from desire to improve access for the \npoor to municipal services. There is significant scope to improve municipal services through \nfinancial and technical support to rehabilitate the infrastructure, and develop the capacities of \nthe municipal companies. It is incumbent upon the Government to attract external financial \nresources to complement its own limited resources in order to meet the priority demands of the \nsector. \n \nC.  Scope of the Economic Analysis \n \n4.  Any subproject with a cost of $2 million or more requires economic analysis which \nshould  be  conducted  by  MDF  in  conjunction  with  its  feasibility  study.  Smaller  subprojects \ncosting less than $2 million will be evaluated on the basis of cost-effectiveness. \n \nD.  Major Benefits and Cost\u2013Benefit Analysis \n \n5.  The  major  benefits  and  required  cost\u2013benefit  analysis  are  outlined  below  for  each \nspecific category of subproject to be covered by the Project. \n \n6.  Water Supply. The major benefits that can be considered in the economic analysis \ninclude  (i)  utilities\u2019  operation  and  maintenance  cost  savings,  (ii)  the  willingness-to-pay  or \nreduction in health costs caused by a reduction in waterborne diseases (whichever is higher) for \ncurrently connected customers, and (iii) the willingness to pay or avoided water collecting and \nstorage costs or reduction in health costs resulting from a reduction in waterborne diseases \n(whichever is highest) for customers to be connected under the Project.  \n \n7.  Solid Waste and Wastewater. The solid waste and wastewater treatment subproject \nwill reduce the pollution of ground and surface water bodies. As a result, public health benefits, \ni.e., the reduction of waterborne diseases, are expected. However, these benefits will accrue to \nthe  public  as  a  whole,  particularly  the  users  of  these  water  bodies,  rather  than  to  direct \n                                                 \n \n1  ADB. 1997. Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects. Manila; and ADB. 1998. Guidelines for the Economic \nAnalysis of Water Supply Projects. Manila. \n \n ", "46   Appendix 12   \n \nrecipients of services. Practical quantification of the benefits is difficult and costly. Therefore, no \nquantitative cost\u2013benefit analysis is required for this type of subprojects. The subprojects falling \ninto this category will be evaluated on the basis of cost-effectiveness. \n \n8.  Urban Road and Public Transport. The major benefits that can be considered in the \neconomic  analysis  include  (i)  utilities\u2019 operation  and  maintenance cost  savings,  (ii)  vehicle \noperating cost savings caused by improved road conditions and reduced detours, (iii) decreased \ntravel time resulting from reduced congestion and detours, and (iv) reductions in pollution and \nhazards. \n \nE.  Methodologies \n \n9.  The methodologies adopted in subproject economic analysis should be in line with those \nstipulated in ADB\u2019s Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects (footnote 1), including, \namong other things, (i) demand assessment and projection; (ii) distinguishing incremental and \nnon-incremental  demands;  (iii)  identification  and  quantification  of  costs  and  benefits;  and \n(iv) conversion of financial costs to economic costs. Sensitivity analysis should examine the \nimpact of cost increase, benefits decrease, and completion delays on a subproject\u2019s economic \nviability.  \n \nF.  Criteria \n \n10.  To be eligible for financing under the Project, for a subproject that requires a cost\u2013\nbenefit analysis, the economic internal rate of return should be at least 12%. For a subproject \nthat does not require a cost\u2013benefit analysis, the subproject should have been justified as the \nleast-cost solution to achieve the subproject objectives, based on cost-effectiveness.  \n \nG.  Review Procedure and Institutional Capacity of the Municipal Development Fund \nof Georgia \n \n11.  MDF will review the adequacy of the economic analysis included in the feasibility study \nreport  and  verify  (i)  the  assumptions  and  data  used  in  the  economic  analysis,  (ii)  the \nappropriateness of the methodologies adopted by the analysis, and (iii) the economic eligibility \nof the subproject to be financed by the Project. The results of the review will be presented in a \nboard memo, which will form the basis for the supervisory board to discuss and consider the \nsubproject\u2019s eligibility for MDF financing. \n \n  ", "  Appendix 13  47 \nENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT AND REVIEW FRAMEWORK \nA.  Description of the Financial Intermediary \n1.  The  Municipal  Development  Fund  of  Georgia  (MDF),  as  the  executing  agency  and \nfinancial intermediary for the Project, is a legal entity of public law whose purpose is to mobilize \nfinancial  resources  from  donors\u2014including  international  and  domestic  financial  institutions, \ndevelopment  partner  agencies,  and  government  agencies\u2014for  investments  in  local \ninfrastructure and services. MDF was established by a presidential decree for the purpose of \nmanaging the investment component of the World Bank\u2019s First Municipal Development and \nDecentralization Project (MDDP I) and subsequently MDDP II and other development agency-\nfunded projects. \n \n2.  In carrying out its activities, MDF acts in accordance with the provisions of the Law on \nLegal Entity of Public Law of 28 May 1999, the provisions of other relevant laws of Georgia, \norders and decrees of the president of Georgia, agreements of the Government of Georgia with \ninternational financial institutions, MDF\u2019s charter, and the instructions in its operations manual. \nMDF is financially autonomous.  \n \nB.  Description of the Proposed Project \n3.  The Project comprises two components: (i) an investment projects financing facility, and \n(ii)  project  management  and  capacity  development.  The  output  of  the  first  component  is \nincreased  quality,  coverage,  and  reliability  of  water  supply,  waste  water,  solid  waste \nmanagement, urban transport, and roads. The outputs of the project management and capacity \ndevelopment component are (i) improved capacity of municipal governments to prepare and \nappraise feasibility, engineering design, environmental, social, and other related studies; (ii) \nimproved capacity in project management at the municipal level; (iii) strengthened corporate \nand business planning processes within MDF; and (iv) improved capacity of MDF for studies \nand training.   \n \nC.   Overview of the Environmental Management System  \n1.  Assessment of Capability of Environmental Management Officers and Staff \n4.  Presently, MDF has one environmental specialist under the management monitoring and \nevaluation  division.  The  specialist  is  responsible  for  providing  technical  assistance  to  the \nborrowing municipalities and supervising environmental assessment for all the investments \nfinanced  under  the  World  Bank\u2019s  MDDP  II  and  by  the  Millennium  Challenge  Corporation. \nApproval and implementation of the Project is likely to impose additional strain on the single \nspecialist\u2019s capacity, particularly considering that Asian Development Bank (ADB) procedures, \ndespite broad similarities with World Bank procedures, are new to Georgia and MDF. \n \n2.  Overview of Financial Intermediary\u2019s Environmental Policy \n5.  MDF does not have a separate environmental policy. However, its operation has been \ngoverned by the environmental laws in Georgia and the World Bank\u2019s environmental safeguards \npolicy for investments financed under MDDP I and II, and the safeguards policies of other \ndevelopment agencies, including the Millennium Challenge Corporation.  \n \n ", "48  Appendix 13   \n \n3.  Description of Environmental Performance Monitoring and Reporting \nSystem \n6.  There  are  three  distinct  stages  of  environmental  assessment  during  a  typical  MDF \nproject cycle: identification, appraisal, and implementation. \n \n7.  Preliminary Environmental Assessment at Identification Stage. The main objective \nof the preliminary environmental screening of projects proposed for MDF financing is to ensure \nthat proposals for projects with potentially adverse effects that cannot be effectively mitigated \nare excluded from financing. During this stage, the following steps will be taken by MDF: \n \n(i)  Carry  out  a  desk  environmental  assessment  using  available  documents  to \nidentify the proximity of the project impact area to protected areas, resorts, or \nother restricted or extremely sensitive zones. \n(ii)  Collect  evidence  that  the  proposed  project  does  not  violate  environmental \nregulation. \n(iii)  Evaluate  evidence  of  unavoidable  and  adverse  environmental  impacts  that \ncannot be mitigated, and explore  possible design alternatives and mitigation \nmeasures.  If  such  alternatives  and  effective  mitigation  measures  are  not \navailable or are deemed unfeasible at a reasonable cost within the limits set by \nthe local government\u2019s borrowing capacity, declare the project ineligible and/or \ndirect local government to other possible financing sources. \n \n8.  The results of the environmental screening and assessment should be summarized \nusing  statements  such  as  \u201cno  significant  environmental  impacts  are  anticipated,\"  \u201cpossible \nadverse environmental impacts can be effectively mitigated,\" \u201cproposed subproject violates \nexisting environmental regulations,\" or \u201cproject will lead to positive environmental impacts.\" The \nwritten  comments  of  the  evaluation  should  include  a  brief  description  of  the  affected \nenvironment, potential impacts, and recommendations on (i) the involvement of environmental \nconsultants; (ii) the need to consider alternative technical, siting, and other solutions; (iii) the \nneed for specific prevention and mitigation measures; and (iv) the desired level of environmental \nassessment and public involvement at further stages. \n \n9.  Environmental  Assessment  at  Final  Appraisal  Stage.  The  tasks  of  MDF  during \nappraisal include \n \n(i)  visiting the project site and carrying out field assessment, including participating \nin public hearings and consultations; \n(ii)  comparing  results  and  recommendations  of  the  preliminary  environmental \nassessment with the final project documentation; ascertaining that necessary \nenvironmental permits (including land use, resources use, debris disposal, and \nsanitary inspection) and approvals are in place or can be obtained; \n(iii)  preparing  the  environmental  assessment  including,  where  needed,  an \nenvironmental management plan (EMP); \n(iv)  consulting and disclosing the relevant information on the project\u2019s environmental \nimpacts in a form and manner understandable to those being consulted; \n(v)  examining  the  project  documentation  to  check  that  (a)  the  environmental \nassessment was performed in accordance with regulations and that it followed \nthe  recommendations  of  the  preliminary  environmental  assessment,  (b)  the \ndocumentation  includes  all  the  necessary  permits  and  approvals  required  at \nappraisal stage, (c) appropriate prevention and mitigation measures have been \n  ", "  Appendix 13  49 \nplanned  and  necessary  resources  have  been  allocated,  and  (d)  the  project \ndocumentation and findings of the final site visits have been presented to the \npublic and the project does not draw public objections; and \n(vi)  making  recommendations  on  the  level  and  mechanisms  of  environmental \nmonitoring during construction and subsequent operations of the project facilities. \n \n10.  Implementation of Environmental Management Plan. During project implementation, \nMDF will monitor implementation of the EMP, as well as the mitigation of any unexpected \nadverse environmental impacts. In the case of a major change in project scope, MDF will \nensure  that  the  environmental  assessment  is  triggered,  and  that  the  project  proponent \nundertakes  the  environmental  assessment  process. 1  MDF  will  prepare  the  semiannual \nmonitoring report, which will describe the EMP implementation and results, compliance with \nADB loan covenants and applicable government environmental laws and regulations, and the \noverall  performance  of  MDF\u2019s  environmental  management  system  and  any  needed \nimprovements. MDF will ensure that the EMP be included in bidding and contract documents for \nsubprojects. \n \nF.  Proposed Environmental Assessment and Review Procedures for Investments \n1.  Overview of Type of Investments to be Assessed \n11.  Investment projects financed by MDF loans and grants from the project resources will be \nlimited exclusively to rehabilitation, reconstruction, and repair of existing basic municipal service \ninfrastructure and facilities, and replacement of equipment for services delivery. The main sector \ncoverage  for  the  proposed  project  will  be  water  supply  and  wastewater  treatment,  urban \ntransport,  solid  waste  management,  and  coal  gasification  and  district  heating.  While  the \ninvestments in general will potentially bring about significant environmental benefits, some of \nthem may cause adverse environmental impacts during project implementation and operation. \nFor example, wastewater treatment helps improve water quality, which has a positive impact on \nhuman health, while improper disposal of sludge may cause environmental damage and harm \nhuman health. Similarly, solid waste disposal projects can have beneficial impacts on human \nhealth and living conditions, but poorly designed and implemented landfill sites may pollute \nunderground water. \n \n2.  Country Environmental Assessment and Review Procedures \n12.  At  present,  environmental  permit  procedures  are  set  out  in  two  laws\u2014the  laws  of \nEnvironmental  Impact  Permit  (2008)  and  Ecological  Expertise  (2008).  Until  2005,  the  two \nprincipal environmental laws in Georgia were the Law on Environmental Permits and the Law on \nState Ecological Expertise, both of which came into effect in 1997. The Law on Environmental \nPermits  regulated  procedures  for  issuing  permits,  and  covered  environmental  permits, \nenvironmental impact assessments (EIAs), and public information and participation issues in \ndecision-making procedures. In accordance with the law, all projects were divided into four \ncategories based on their size, importance, and potential impact on the environment. While all \ncategories of projects must undergo Law on State Ecological Expertise2 (Review) to be issued a \npermit,  the  requirements  of  the  environmental  permit  process  are  different  for  different \ncategories of projects. \n \n                                                 \n \n1  World Bank. 1998. Pollution Prevention and Abatement Handbook. Washington, DC. \n2  Implemented from 1 January 1 1997. \n ", "50  Appendix 13   \n \n13.  On 24 June 2005, the Law on Licenses and Permits was adopted by Parliament. The \nnew law regulates legally organized activities posing certain threats to human life and health, \nand addresses specific state or public interests, including usage of state resources. It also \nregulates activities requiring licenses or permits; determines types of licenses and permits; and \ndefines the procedures for issuing, revising, and canceling of licenses and permits. A new law \non environmental impact permit has replaced the 1997 Law on Environmental Permits. \n \n14.  A major difference between new and old procedures is that, unlike the old procedures \nthat classified projects into four categories, the new procedures have been simplified to include \nonly two categories, i.e., those activities that require an EIA and those that do not. There are \n24 categories of activities\u2014including construction of facilities for recycling of solid domestic \nwastes  (e.g.,  incineration  plants)  and/or  landfill  sites,  wastewater  treatment  facilities  and \nsewerage pipes, and water supply facilities\u2014which are subject to the EIA procedures in order to \nbe  issued  an  environmental  permit,  while  none  of  the  others  require  an  EIA.  The  new \ngovernment procedures are different from ADB requirements, which categorize projects into \nthree  categories  (A,  B,  and  C,  see  para.  21).  Furthermore,  in  determining  environmental \nstandards for ADB-supported projects, ADB follows the standards and approaches laid out in \nthe World Bank\u2019s Pollution Prevention and Abatement Handbook (footnote 1). However, with \nproper justification, the environmental assessment for any individual project may recommend \nadoption of alternative emission levels and approaches to pollution prevention and abatement to \nbetter reflect national legislation and local conditions (footnote 1). \n \n15.  Under the current procedures, the proponent of a project who seeks an environmental \npermit is expected to conduct an environmental assessment and public consultations within the \ndesired time frame and according to the required procedure. The proponent will involve the \nMinistry of Environment Protection and Natural Resources in the process of conducting the \nenvironmental assessment. Upon completion of the environmental assessment, the proponent \nmay apply to the ministry for an environmental permit. The ministry will carry out state ecological \nexpertise of the Project (for which the EIA has already been conducted) and issue a permit \nwithin 20 days.  \n \n3.  Specific Procedures to be Used for Investments Under the Project \n16.  Responsibilities and Authorities. MDF as the Executing Agency of the Project will \nbear the overall responsibility of ensuring full compliance of the Project with the environmental \nregulations  and  policies  of  Georgia  and  ADB.  This  includes  (i)  conducting  preliminary \nenvironmental assessment, including environmental categorization and screening; (ii) ensuring \nthe environmental assessment is conducted in a satisfactory manner during the appraisal stage; \n(iii)  ensuring  all  the  environmental  permits  and  approvals  have  been  obtained;  and \n(iv) conducting  monitoring  during  project  implementation.  MDF  will  be  responsible  for \ncoordinating with ADB\u2019s Central and West Asia Department (CWRD) in applying and satisfying \nADB\u2019s environmental safeguard procedures. \n17.  The Ministry of Environment and its regional offices will be responsible for issuing the \nenvironmental permits or consents when all the conditions are met, and may participate in the \nenvironmental monitoring to be conducted by MDF during project implementation. MDF will be \nresponsible for (i) conducting the environmental categorization using ADB\u2019s rapid environmental \nassessment checklist, (ii) conducting the required environmental assessment, (iii) preparing the \nEMP if required, (iv) obtaining all the necessary environmental permits and approvals, and \n(v) monitoring implementation of the environmental mitigation measures as specified in the \nEMP.  The  main  responsibilities  of  CWRD  will  be  (i)  reviewing  and  clearing  environmental \n  ", "  Appendix 13  51 \nassessment reports for category A and category B subprojects deemed sensitive by ADB, and \n(ii) conducting review missions to monitor implementation of the EMP\u2014ADB reserves the right \nto review any subproject proposal and its EIA or initial environmental examination (IEE). In \naddition, CWRD will provide technical support on ADB environmental safeguards policy and \nprocedures.  \n \n18.  Environmental Criteria for Subproject Selection. The Project will primarily focus on \ninvestments with no significant adverse environmental impacts. However, in some exceptional \ncases where the needs for financing environmentally sensitive subprojects (e.g., landfill sites) \nare  well  justified,  such  subprojects  may  be  considered.  ADB  and  the  Government\u2019s \nenvironmental  assessment  and  management  procedures  will  be  strictly  followed,  and \nenvironmental risks will be minimized to an acceptable level as a result of a properly assessed \nand planned mitigation program. \n \n19.  Environmental Classification. MDF will undertake the environmental categorization \nprocess  of  the  investments  using  rapid  environmental  assessment  checklists  in  ADB\u2019s \nEnvironmental Assessment Guidelines (2003). The categories are described as follows: \n \n(i)  Category  A. Investments with potential for significant adverse environmental \nimpacts. An EIA is required to address significant impacts. \n(ii)  Category B. Investments judged to have some adverse environmental impacts, \nbut of lesser degree or significance than those for category A projects. An IEE is \nrequired to determine whether significant environmental impacts warranting an \nEIA  are  likely.  If  an  EIA  is  not  needed,  the  IEE  is  regarded  as  the  final \nenvironmental assessment report. \n(iii)  Category C. Investments unlikely to have adverse environmental impacts. No \nEIA or IEE is required, although environmental implications are still reviewed. \n \n20.  Preparation of Initial Environmental Examinations. For category B subprojects, an \nIEE will be prepared in accordance with the requirements outlined in ADB\u2019s Environmental \nAssessment Guidelines. The IEE should be undertaken as part of the feasibility study, and the \nenvironmental assessment team should work closely with the technical planning and design \ngroup to ensure that environmental considerations are integrated into the project design. The \nIEE must decide whether significant environmental impacts warranting an EIA are likely. If the \nEIA is warranted, the IEE must provide a recommendation on the scope and terms of reference \nfor the EIA. Where no further EIA is recommended, the IEE must include an EMP for each \npredicted impact, and this will outline identified mitigation measures with (i) cost estimates, \n(ii) responsible parties for implementation, (iii) type of monitoring to be conducted, (iv) frequency \nand location of the monitoring, and (v) responsible parties for the monitoring. All the strategic \nalternatives should be assessed and decisions should be taken at the feasibility study stage. \nFurther, the EIA should be focused on the preferred alternative(s). \n \n21.  Preparation of Environmental Impact Assessments. For any category A investments \nincluded for project financing, an EIA will be conducted in accordance with the requirements \noutlined in ADB\u2019s Environmental Assessment Guidelines. The EIA, which will generally have a \nbroader and more detailed scope of work than an IEE, should be undertaken as part of the \nfeasibility and detailed design, and the environmental assessment team should work closely \nwith the technical planning and design group to ensure that environmental considerations are \nintegrated into the project design. The EIA must include an EMP for each predicted impact, and \nthis will outline identified mitigation measures with (i) cost estimates, (ii) responsible parties for \n ", "52  Appendix 13   \n \nimplementation, (iii) type of monitoring to be conducted, (iv) frequency and location of the \nmonitoring, and (v) responsible parties for the monitoring. \n \n22.  Requirements for Public Consultation. For category A and B investments, MDF must \nconsult  with  groups  affected  by  the  proposed  investments  and  local  nongovernment \norganizations. The consultation should take place as early as possible in the project cycle so the \nviews  of  the  affected  people  can  be  taken  into  account  in  project  design  and  mitigation \nmeasures included. For category A investments, MDF will ensure that consultation takes place \nat least twice: once during the early stage of EIA fieldwork, and once when the draft EIA report \nis available. \n \n23.  Requirements  for  Information  Disclosure.  Summary  EIA  reports  for  category  A \nsubprojects and summary IEE reports for category B sensitive subprojects are required to be \nposted on MDF and ADB websites. ADB\u2019s 120-day rule  requires that the full EIA for a category \nA subproject or the full IEE for a category B sensitive subproject be available to the general \npublic at least 120 days before subproject approval.   \n \n24.  Review  of  Environmental  Assessment  Reports.  MDF  will  submit  an  EIA  for \ncategory A subprojects or IEE for category B sensitive subprojects to CWRD for review and \nclearance, and to the Ministry of Environment. \n \n25.  Monitoring Environmental Performance. MDF, the borrowing municipalities, and in \nsome  cases  the  Ministry  of  Environment,  can  conduct  the  environmental  monitoring  in \naccordance with the plans and schedules outlined in the EMP. The monitoring results will be \nincluded as part of the progress report and submitted to ADB on a semiannual basis. \n \n  ", "  Appendix 14  53 \n \nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY \n \nCountry/Project Title: Georgia: Municipal Services Development Project \u2013 Phase 2 \n \nLending/Financing  Department/  Central and West Asia Department/ \nFinancial Intermediation \nModality:  Division:  Urban Services Division \n       \nI.  POVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.  Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \n \nPoverty reduction and economic development have been top priorities for the Government of Georgia for a number of years. \nSeveral reforms have been launched for the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). As poverty \nreduction through economic growth was a key priority for the Government\u2019s reform program, social spending was increased \nby 5% of gross domestic product from 2003 to 2005, pension and wage arrears were eliminated, and a targeted poverty \nbenefit was introduced in 2006. The links between the governance and growth reform agendas, and their impact on \nemployment and poverty reduction, suggest that Georgia\u2019s reform program is on the right track. Poverty is expected to decline \nas the economy\u2019s capacity to generate new jobs develops and a well-targeted and fiscally sustainable social safety net is \nimplemented. Under the Poverty Reduction Support Operation III, the Government expanded the coverage of the targeted \npoverty benefit to about 90,000 extremely poor households and will expand it to 130,000 households under the Poverty \nReduction Support Operation IV.  \n \nInadequate  municipal  infrastructure\u2014including  transport,  waste  management,  waste  water,  and  drinking  water\u2014is  a \ncontributing factor to the incidence of urban poverty in Georgia. Supporting participating municipal governments in providing \nand improving the above public services, could significantly improve the living condition and economic development of \nmunicipal populations. The rehabilitation of water supply and sewerage services, and improved management of solid waste \nand concomitant public and environmental health improvements, will see benefits spread to the entire municipal population, \nincluding the poor and especially women for whom water supply and waste management are among the most critical needs. \nImproved transport will enhance public safety and the quality of the urban environment. Investments in the infrastructure \nsectors will create employment for poor people. \n \nGeorgia only became an Asian Development Bank (ADB) member country in February 2007. ADB has prepared the Georgia \ninterim operational strategy (2008\u20132009).a ADB and the Government has identified two projects that will constitute the core \nprogram for 2008\u20132009: the Municipal Services Development Project 1 and 2, and the Regional Roads Development Project.  \n  \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                  Targeting Classification: Targeted intervention (MDGs) \n1.  Key Issues  \n \nThe high unemployment rate of 13.3% is expected to rise further because of the economic downturn and a significant \nincrease in the number of internally displaced persons in the wake of the August 2008 conflict. In turn, the rise in \nunemployment is expected to affect poverty incidence, which was 23.6% in 2007. \n \nPoor people tend to have larger households and less access to essential infrastructure and services, including electricity, \nwater supply, and waste water. In 2004, a new phase of social policy started in Georgia that was characterized by the \ntransition from a universal social safety system to a poverty reduction system. On this basis, the Government established a \nsocial assistance and employment agency in 2006, with the main function of implementing a poverty reduction program. \n \nThe Government aims to reduce overall poverty incidence by strengthening the social assistance system, improving access of \nthe poor to affordable basic services, and raising net job creation rates. Sustained growth is to be pursued through adherence \nto macroeconomic prudence, economic diversification, and infrastructure development. The national objective of reducing \nextreme poverty is likely to be achieved with the successful reform of a social assistance program that aims to reach the \npoorest and most vulnerable segments of the population. The social sectors now account for about a third of public spending. \nHowever, achieving the MDG for access to safe drinking water is likely to be more challenging as there are significant \ndifferences in access to infrastructure services between rural and urban areas, and between poorer and more developed \nregions of the country. \n \nWith respect to water supply and waste water, the 2004 study on the water supply and waste water sector by the World Bank \nand the Government summarized the following: (i) water, waste water, and wastewater conditions in most cities and towns \nrange from poor to very poor; (ii) water supply to homes is unstable and in most cases the hours or supply are declining and \nmany households use multiple water sources to meet their daily water demand; (iii) wastewater treatment plans are not fully \noperational; (iv) public health risks are increasing because of the discharge of nontreated wastewater and insufficient \n ", "54   Appendix 14 \n \n \ntreatment of piped water; (v) water supply facilities are old and suffer from deferred maintenance and repair, except in a few \ncases in major cities funded mainly through the Municipal Development Fund of Georgia (MDF).  \n \n2.  Design Features \n \nInadequate urban infrastructure, including transport, is a significant contributing factor to urban poverty in Georgia. The benefit \nin addressing the urban infrastructure of the proposed project for the participating municipal governments will be significant \nimprovements in living conditions (including crucial public health benefits) and significant poverty reduction through improved \nservice provision, and stimulation of economic development by encouraging investment, job creation, and labor mobility. In \naddition, investment will bring faster and more comfortable transport for all sectors of the city population, and reduced traffic \ncongestion and air pollution. Finally, the project will target vulnerable communities such as elderly and poor people.  \n \nII.  SOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA. Finding of Social Analysis \n \nThe main stakeholders in this Project will be MDF, participating municipal governments, the private sector, utilities companies, \nand communities. \n \nIn recent years, insufficient investment has been available from the central government for rehabilitation of infrastructure or \nthe adequate provision of services. Preexisting mechanisms and systems for maintenance and service provision have \ncollapsed or are no longer appropriate. The level of dependence on central government (by local governments and \ncommunities) for the provision of all infrastructure and maintenance services is generally high. \n \nThe major challenges for the municipal governments are: (i) how to improve basic municipal infrastructure and services in a \nsustainable  way,  (ii)  how  to  build  the  internal  capacities  necessary  to  plan  and  implement  appropriate  infrastructure \ninterventions and develop sustainable service provision, and (iii) how to engage local communities to mobilize their own \nhuman and financial resources in support of infrastructure projects. The third challenge will require changes in attitude and \nbehaviors with regard to payment for and maintenance of the system after rehabilitation.  \n \nB. Consultation and Participation \n \n1.  Provide a summary of the consultation and participation process during the project preparation. \n \nThe civil society sector is quite active in poverty eradication. CSOs\u2019 activities include business development programs, \nemployment creation, health and sanitation education, public awareness, and good governance. Public awareness campaigns \nto better educate customers about essential infrastructure services could lead to improved collection rates, protection of \nwatersheds, and conservation of natural assets. As the process of decentralization continues, more administrative and \nservice-delivery responsibilities\u2014including urban transport, solid waste management, water supply, road maintenance, and \nstreet lighting\u2014become a function of local government. Involving communities and CSOs is important to (i) ensure that \nparticipating municipal governments are using MDF support on important infrastructure and (ii) improve the prospect for \nsustainable implementation.  \n \nThe main stakeholders in this project will be MDF, participating municipal governments, private sector and/or utilities \ncompanies, communities, and CSOs including community-based organizations. MDF and participating municipal governments \nwill ensure that the results of social assessment and stakeholder consultations will be adequately taken into account in \ndetermining investment priorities, making related financial decisions, and implementing investment projects. Participating \nmunicipal governments will coordinate investment priorities and assessing the financial effects and affordability of loan \nfinancing for improvement of infrastructure and services. As part of the preparation of any investments under this project, \nMDF will (i) ensure that a social assessment is carried out in close cooperation with the participating municipal governments; \n(ii)  identify  potential  social  issues  associated  with  investment,  carry  out  adequate  public  and  municipal  government \nparticipation and consultation; and (iii) ensure that arrangements are made for carrying out appropriate levels of participation \nand consultation during project implementation.   \n  \n2.  What level of consultation and participation (C&P) is envisaged during the project implementation and monitoring?  \n  Information sharing          Consultation         Collaborative decision making       Empowerment \n \n3.

Georgian legislation declares the equality of men and women in regard to civil and political rights.  \n \nAlong gender lines, the labor market in Georgia is segmented. Women are mainly employed in the public sector (117 women \nper 100 men) as opposed to the non-public sector (57 women per 100 men). Women in the non-public sector are mostly \nemployed in agriculture, education, health care, and small manufacturing, which have been most negatively affected by \neconomic transition. Most women manage their households\u2014including water, sanitation, and solid waste\u2014and are the most \naffected by the inadequate nature of water supply and sanitation infrastructure. \n \nThe Project will directly and indirectly benefit women by promoting improved infrastructure, including waste management, \nsanitation, potable water, roads, and urban transport. The primary concerns of women need to be addressed in the Project \ndesign and will be part of the consultative process. Initial discussion with CSOs working on gender issues revealed support for \nthe proposed projects since they are perceived as necessary improvements in the urban living environment and critical for \nreducing health hazards like waterborne diseases.      \n \n2.
