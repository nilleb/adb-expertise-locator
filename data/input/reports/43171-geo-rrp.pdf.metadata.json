The environmental concerns will \nbe  addressed  through  the  environmental  assessment  and  review \nframework agreed with the Municipal Development Fund of Georgia \n(MDF). \n \nThe  proposed  Municipal  Services  Development  Project  -  Phase  2 \n(MSDP  2)  finances  investments  in  municipal  infrastructure  and \nutility  services.  It  focuses  on  urban  transport,  but  could  flexibly \nrespond to other municipal infrastructure. It will provide (i) proceeds \nto  MDF  for  financing  to  selected  municipalities  for  repairing  and \nrehabilitating  municipal  infrastructure  and  local  utility  services,  and \n(ii)  capacity  development  for  MDF  and  municipalities  through \nincremental administration and technical assistance programs. \n \nThe  MSDP  2  follows  the  Municipal  Services  Development  Project \n(MSDP  1)  approved  in  August  2008.  It  targets  high-priority  urban \ntransport  projects  in  Tbilisi  and  other  municipalities,  which  were \nproposed  for  additional  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  financing \nunder  the  MSDP  1.  As  available  financing  under  the  MSDP  1  is \nlargely  committed  to  other  priority  investments,  a  new  facility  is \nproposed.  \n \nThe  double  shocks  of  the  August  2008  conflict  with  the  Russian \nFederation and the global economic crisis undermined growth and \nstability in Georgia. Investor and consumer confidence deteriorated \nand liquidity in the banking system contracted, while infrastructure \nInvestment  and  economic  development \nwas \ndeclined  and  foreign  direct  investment  slowed.  This  stressed  the \nbalance  of  payments,  shrank  public \nfrom  revenue \nshortfalls, and increased expenditure needs.  \n \nEconomic  growth  has  plunged  from  10.0%  in  2007  to  2.1%  in \n2008.  The  Georgian  authorities  responded  with  macroeconomic \npolicies,  but  the  GEL2.2  billion  stimulus  has  limited  municipal \nfunding.  \n \nChallenges  in  the  urban  transport  sector  are  palpable.  Tbilisi \n\nleft  damaged. \n\nfinances \n\n\fii \n\n \n\nsuffers from traffic congestion, and air and noise pollution. This is \ndue to increased private car ownership, inadequate roads, and the \ndeteriorating public transport systems including discontinuing tram \nand  trolleybus  services.  About  80%  of  air  pollution  derives  from \nmotor  transport.  Road  accidents  have  increased,  with  over  4,000 \nreported  in  Tbilisi  in  2007,  and  a  62%  increase  in  the  number  of \npeople injured in 5 years.  \n \nTherefore,  the  Government  requested  ADB  to  urgently  support  a \nprogram  of  investments  in  Tbilisi's  municipal  transport  systems, \nincluding roads, traffic management, and public transport.  \n \nThe MSDP 2 will finance MDF, an effective agency, for improving \nmunicipal  transport  systems.  The  Project  is  technically  feasible, \ninstitutionally sound, and economically viable. This new facility: \n \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n(v) \n\nsupports government and ADB priorities; \nresponds swiftly to the Government\u2019s request; \ncomplies  with  a  mutually  defined  development \nframework; \ncapitalizes on the proven MDF arrangements; and \nreinforces  ADB\u2019s \ndevelopment with Georgia. \n\nlong-term  partnership \n\nin  urban \n\n \nThe  MSDP  2  will  improve  the  urban  environment,  local  economy, \nand  public  health  in  urban  areas.  The  projected  outcome  is \nimproved  municipal  infrastructure  and  service  delivery  and  better \nliving  conditions.  The  outputs  are  (i)  increased  quality  of  service, \nwider  network  coverage,  efficient  and  reliable  urban  services \nparticularly  for  urban  transport  and  traffic  management;  and \n(ii) improved capacity of municipalities and MDF. \n \nThe  investment  cost  of  the  Project  is  estimated  at  $41.50  million \nincluding  taxes  and  duties  of  $5.97  million;  physical  and  price \ncontingencies, and financing charges during implementation. \n \n\n \n\nSource \nAsian Development Bank \nMunicipal Development Fund \nMunicipal Governments \nCentral Government \n\n \n\nTotal  \n($ million) \n30.00 \n3.00 \n6.61 \n1.89 \n41.50 \n\n% \n72.28 \n7.23 \n15.92 \n4.57 \n100.00 \n\n       \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates subject to  \nadjustments during project implementation. \n \n\nADB  will  provide  a  $30  million-equivalent  loan  from  the  Asian \nDevelopment Fund (ADF) hard-term facility.

It will then be passed on to eligible municipal \ngovernments as a combination of loans and grants or grants to the \nmunicipalities,  which  have  limited  or  zero  capacity  to  borrow. \nEstablished  eligibility  criteria  for  borrowing  are  based  on  the \ncreditworthiness of each municipal government.  \n \nto  municipal \nExcept  as  otherwise  agreed, \ngovernments  will  be  in  lari  and  will  be  repayable  in  the  same \ncurrency over a period of up to 10 years, including a grace period of \nup  to  1.5  years  to  cover  the  construction  period.  MDF  will  charge \n12% interest on these loans to include provisions for credit defaults, \nthe cost of MDF administration and other operational expenses, and \na margin of profit.  \n \nUntil 30 June 2014 \n \n31 December 2013 \n \n \nMunicipal Development Fund of Georgia (MDF) \n \nMDF will be both the implementing and the executing agency.

The \nPrime  Minister  heads  its  supervisory  board.  Since  1997,  about \n900 municipal and regional projects have been implemented. \n \nProcurement  activities  will  follow  ADB's  Procurement  Guidelines \n(2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  Contracts  for  civil  works \nabove  $1  million  equivalent,  and  contracts  for  goods  above \n$500,000 equivalent will be procured using international competitive \nbidding.  Civil  works  contracts  costing  $1  million  equivalent  or  less, \nand  contracts  for  goods  costing  between  $100,000  and  $500,000 \nequivalent, will be carried out through national competitive bidding. \nGoods  contracts  less  than  $100,000  equivalent  will  be  carried  out \nthrough  shopping  procedures.  Goods  valued  below  $10,000  and \ncivil works valued up to $10,000 may be purchased directly from the \nsupplier and contractor.  \n \nSelecting and engaging consultants will follow ADB\u2019s Guidelines on \nthe  Use  of  Consultants  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time): \n(i) quality-  and  cost-  based  selection;  (ii)  quality-based  selection; \n(iii) consultants\u2019  qualifications  selection \nfor  small  consultancy \nassignments  less  than  $200,000  per  contract;  (iv)  least-cost \n\n \n\n\fiv \n\n \n\n \nProject Benefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\n \nRisks and \nAssumptions \n\nless \n\nthan \nfor  very  small  consultancy  assignments \nselection \n$100,000;  (v)  fixed  budget  selection;  and  (vi)  single  source \nselection  and  ADB  individual  consultant  selection  procedures  for \nindividual national or international consultants for assignments such \nas  environmental,  social,  tariff,  and  operation  and  maintenance \nstudies. \n \nThe  MSDP  2  will  directly  benefit  people  and  businesses. \nInvestments  in  urban  transport  will  improve  people  mobility  and \nhealth, and increase the livability of the city. They will improve traffic \nflow and air quality, reduce traffic accidents, increase tourist interest \nand protect the city heritage.  \n \nIf relevant, investments in water supply and waste management will \nimprove health and living conditions through safer and more reliable \nwater,  improved  environmental  waste  water  treatment  through \nbetter sewerage and solid waste management services, and saving \ntime when collecting water.  \n \nThe \ninfrastructure \noperation  and  maintenance  costs.

The  design \nand monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nA. \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\nin \n\nliquidity \n\nto  2.1% \n\nin  recent  years \n\n2. \nOver  the  past  5  years,  Georgia  has  implemented  far-reaching  strategic  reforms  and \ndevelopment initiatives with impressive results. Widespread anticorruption measures and deep \nstructural  reforms  helped  improve  public  administration  and  establish  strong  mechanisms  of \naccountability and transparency. Reforms have cut across all areas of government. Reforms in \ntax, customs, and the regulatory environment helped develop a dynamic and competitive private \nsector  as  the  main  engine  of  growth,  with  state  support  providing  basic  public  goods  and \nservices.  Such  a  strong  record  of  reforms  in  Georgia  led  to  rapid  economic  growth  of  10.5% \nduring  2005\u20132007.  A  key  driver  of  this  growth  has  been  substantial  inflows  of  foreign  direct \ninvestment, amounting to $1.5 billion (15% of gross domestic product) in 2007. \n \nThe double shocks resulting from the August 2008 conflict with the Russian Federation, \n3. \nand  the  ongoing  global  economic  crisis,  undermined  growth  and  stability.  Investor  and \nconsumer  confidence  deteriorated, \nthe  banking  system  contracted,  and \ninfrastructure  was  left  damaged.  Investment  and  economic  development  declined and  foreign \ndirect  investment  slowed.  This  stressed  the  balance  of  payments  and  shrank  public  finances \nfrom revenue shortfalls, and increased expenditure needs. Economic growth has plunged from \n10.0% \nin  2008.  The  Georgian  authorities  responded  with \nmacroeconomic  policies,  but  the  GEL2.2 billion  stimulus  has  limited  municipal  funding. \nInvestments  and  upgrade  of  existing  services  depend  on  available  resources.  Therefore,  the \nGovernment  sought  financial  support  to  boost  the  economy,  energize  local  activities,  and \ngenerate employment\u2014focusing on the urban transport sector. \n \nGeorgia\u2019s urban population has remained stable at about 2.3 million, about 52% of the \n4. \ntotal, from 2000 to 2006.1 Estimates for 2015 indicate little change. Most population movements \nhave  been  from  smaller  towns  to  larger  urban  centers,  rather  than  from  rural  to  urban  areas. \nToday,  government  investment  focuses  on  rehabilitating  basic  infrastructure  because  of \n(i) stabilizing  urban  population,  and  (ii)  neglected  investments  in  infrastructure  assets  and \nmaintenance. Urban areas have inadequate water supply and waste water system, inefficient \nsolid  waste  management,  and  poor  public  transport.  Appendix  2  presents  urban  sector \nproblems.  \n \n5. \nIn  December  2008,  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  approved  a  $40  million-\nequivalent  loan  for  the  Municipal  Services  Development  Project  (MSDP  1),  through  the \nMunicipal  Development  Fund  of  Georgia  (MDF).  Its  scope  covers  water  supply,  waste  water \nsystem, and municipal roads in remote cities. This financing helps upgrade 40-year-old urban \nwater  supply  systems  and  maintain  road  networks.  Since  2009,  MDF  has  rapidly  designed \nsubprojects  and  awarded  contracts.  To  date,  21  subprojects  worth  $11.1  million  have  been \napproved.  The  award  for  planned  contracts  for  2009  is  $7.86  million,  indicating  a  141% \n\n                                                 \n \n1    ADB. 2007. Key Indicators 2007: Inequality in Asia. Manila. \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nachievement  above  projections  (Appendix  3).  MDF  is  following  the  project  administration \nmanual (PAM) approved by ADB, and has proven itself a committed and efficient development \npartner. \n \nSeveral urgent urban transport projects were not included in the list of the MSDP 1 but \n6. \nits resources are now more than 70% committed to the existing pipeline of subprojects. Thus, a \nnumber of priority investments cannot be financed. These investments will help resolve heavy \ntraffic  congestion,  air  and  noise  pollution,  caused  by  increased  private  car  ownership, \ninadequate roads, weak traffic management, and deteriorating public transport services.  \n \nB. \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\nTbilisi  represents  more  than  25%  of  Georgia's  population  but  generates  nearly  50%  of \n7. \nthe  country\u2019s  gross  domestic  product.  The  city  extends  170  square  kilometers  (km2),  with  a \n1,200  km  road  network.  With  1.34  million  people  and  a  density  of  7,900  inhabitants  per  km2, \nTbilisi manifests all the typical problems in metropolitan areas: poor air quality, excessive noise, \ntraffic congestion, loss of green areas, and degraded historical buildings and monuments. The \nhistorical  pattern  of  the  city\u2019s  development,  and  its  resultant  form,  partially  explains  this \nsituation. The urbanized area forms a reverse \u201cS\u201d shape, squeezed between the Mtkvari River, \nthe Metekhi Cliff, and the Saguramo Range, which concentrates all infrastructure and traffic flow \ninto a single corridor. The result is a bottleneck and heavy congestion at peak traffic periods.  \n \n8. \nIncreased  private  car  ownership,  triggered  by  high  economic  growth,  has  recently \nexacerbated  the  problem.  In  2007,  car  ownership  reached  120  cars  per  1,000  inhabitants, \nnearly doubling the number since 2002 and resulting in time-consuming traffic jams, a spike in \nroad accidents, and increased environmental pollution. About 80% of air pollution derives from \nmotor transport, compounded by deficient traffic management and poorly maintained vehicles. \nIn 2007, 4,000 accidents were reported, representing a dramatic 63% increase in people injured \nand killed in 5 years. Therefore, a \u201cglobal\u201d citywide strategy that focuses on all elements of the \nurban  transport  system  is  needed\u2014strengthened  by  complementary  \u201cpush  and  pull\u201d  (coercive \nand incentive) measures. \n \nPublic  transport  services  deteriorated  because  of  poor  road  conditions,  management \n9. \ndeficiencies  among  operators,  and  insufficient  investments  in  fleet  renewal  and  infrastructure \nupgrades. Today, Tbilisi\u2019s urban transport network comprises a two-line metro system, 123 bus \nroutes, and 60 microbus routes operated by public and private companies. Microbuses convey \nthe  bulk  of  daily  passengers,  holding  a  60%  market  share,  while  the  balance  is  split  evenly \nbetween public buses and the metro system. Combined, they represent 400 million passenger-\ntrips annually.  \n \nThrough  the  European  Bank  for  Reconstruction  and  Development  (EBRD)  and  the \n10. \nDutch bilateral assistance, city authorities upgraded the fleet with new and secondhand buses, \nand  offers  better  service  with  affordable  fares.  Private  operators  began  to  complement  the \ndeficient  public  transport  network  with  a  system  with  a  flexible  and  frequent  microbus  service, \nwhich covers most the city. The use of electric transport\u2014trams and trolleys\u2014declined in terms \nof  ridership,  and  in  November  2006,  the  city  government  discontinued  their  networks  as \npassengers  shifted  to  microbuses.  In  September  2006,  to  reduce  road  congestion,  the \nGovernment  started  to  ban  minibuses  from  main  avenues\u2014replacing  them  with  larger,  more \nefficient buses. The number of minibuses in operation fell from 4,500 to 2,000 but the number of \nthe buses is still not sufficient to cope with existing demand.  \n \n\n \n\n\fTbilisi  is  pursuing  a  number  of  initiatives  to  improve  urban  transport,  road  and  traffic \n11. \nmanagement, parking, and the public transport ticketing system. It is now exploring options for \nexpanding an existing asset\u2014the metro network. Serving 250,000 passengers daily, the metro \nnetwork  is  poised  to  play  a  stronger  role  in  the  urban  transport  system  and  can  serve  as  the \nbackbone  of  the  city\u2019s  network.  A  first  phase  is  planned  to  extend  the  line  to  the  university \ndistrict, where a large population of students and high traffic flows exist. Parking was contracted \nthrough  an  auction  to  a  foreign  company\u2014ParkCity\u2014in  January  2009.  In  February  2009,  to \npromote intermodal use of public transport, a $7 million integrated ticketing system for the bus \nand  metro  networks  was  instituted,  using  Czech  technology  and  financing  from  the  Bank  of \nGeorgia.  \n \n12. \nAnother priority in Tbilisi is to decongest the right bank of the Mtkvari river, particularly \nthe Gorgasali street section. This main transit road artery, located on the edge of the old city, \nneeds  redesigning  and  reconstructing  to  segregate  transit  traffic  from  local  traffic.  A  four-lane \ntunnel, parking lots, landscaped gardens, and access to the city\u2019s historical district is proposed. \nTechnical  detailed  design  is  ongoing;  the  project  should  be  completed  within  18  months.  This \nproject may be one of the first subprojects submitted for financing under the MSDP 2, following \nestablished submission and review procedures. \n \n13. \nThe development partner community has been supportive to the country\u2019s urban sector. \nThe World Bank financed transport assistance to Tbilisi municipality, focusing on a road safety, \ntraffic  management,  parking  policy,  public  transport  strategic  planning,  and  action  plan.  Some \nrecommendations  on  parking  management  and  traffic  improvements  have  been  implemented. \nIn 2008, the World Bank directed 20% of its $40 million Regional and Municipal Infrastructure \nProject  loan  for  improvement  of  urban  roads.  The  EBRD  has  also  partnered  with  Georgian \ncities, investing in fleet renewal\u2014particularly in the Tbilisi bus company in 2005 ($4 million) and \nin  Batumi  in  2008  ($2.5  million).  The  EBRD,  the  International  Finance  Corporation,  and  the \nGeorgian  Reconstruction  and  Development  Company  are  involved  in  the  renovation  of  Tbilisi \ncentral railways.  \n \n14. \nThe  Government\u2019s  request  for  financing  for  urban  transport  and  municipal  services \nproject is consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  interim  operational  strategy  for  the  country.2 ADB\u2019s  strategies \nfor  Georgia  are  to  (i)  improve  service  delivery  in  municipal  infrastructure  within  the  evolving \ndecentralization  process,  (ii)  reduce  road  transportation  constraints  on  economic  activity,  and \n(iii)  upgrade  and  develop  energy  infrastructure.  In  the  urban  sector,  ADB  is  focusing  on \n(i) sector  reforms  for  sustainability  of  infrastructure  assets,  (ii)  strengthening  financing  local \ninfrastructure, (iii) stimulating local economic development, and (iv) improving the quality of life \nof the urban population. \n \n15. \nAs with the MSDP 1, the MSDP 2 will adopt the financial intermediation loan modality to \nmeet government constraints and project requirements.3 MDF is not a financial institution. The \n\n                                                 \n \n2  ADB. 2008. Interim Operational Strategy (2008\u20132009): Georgia. Manila. \n3  The  traditional  forms  of  ADB  intervention  in  the  urban  sector  are  the  project  loan,  sector  loan,  and  sector \ndevelopment  program  loan  modalities.  None  of  these  lending  models  satisfied  government  constraints  and  the \nrequirements of the Project. As for the MSDP 1, the Project has adopted the financial intermediation loan modality \nas  the  best  fit.  However,  standard  ADB  financial  intermediation  loan  requirements  (the  participation  of  eligible \nfinancial institutions and commercial entities as well as relending and onlending arrangements) are not applicable. \nThis  approach  was  preferred  as  it  is  in  line  with  ADB\u2019s  urban  sector  strategy,  which  advocates  using  a  greater \nvariety  of  lending  modalities  given  the  rapidly  changing  context  of  financial  markets.  This  will  also  contribute  to \npromotion of development effectiveness by harmonizing ADB assistance with that of its partners and with country \n\n    3 \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\nfor \n\nidentifying,  appraising,  selecting, \n\nGovernment  has  been  using  MDF  (a  special  purpose  vehicle,  the  sole  purpose  of  which  is  to \nprovide  funds  to  municipalities  on  a  grant  or  a  mix  of  loan  and  grant  basis)  to  finance  the \nrehabilitation  of  dilapidated  urban  infrastructure.  MDF  is  not  a  commercial  entity.  Since  its \nestablishment  in  1997,  MDF  has  been  operating  as  a  project  implementation  and  disbursing \nagency  for  funds  provided  under  foreign-assisted  and  locally  funded  projects.  To  sustain  its \ngrowth, MDF started also financing project from its own sources. MDF has the experience and \nnecessary  capacity \nimplementing,  and  monitoring \ndevelopment subprojects under well-established rules, policies, and procedures. \n \n16. \nEnd recipients of the ADB funds are not commercial entities. The Government needs to \nprovide  scarce  public  resources  to  a  wide  range  of  municipalities,  including  those  with  limited \nborrowing  capacity.  The  municipal  governments  are  not  commercial  entities  and  they  do  not \nhave access to commercial finance. The Project will provide additional working capital to MDF \nto  ensure  it  continues  to  meet  the  investment  needs  of  municipal  governments.  This  is  the \ncurrent practice in Georgia and has been proven an effective mechanism for providing municipal \ngovernments with affordable long-term credit and the recovery of such investments. \n \n17. \nThis approach will not distort financial markets. ADB loan proceeds will be provided by \nthe  Government  to  MDF  entirely  on  a  non-refundable  basis.  The  loan  proceeds  will  then  be \nonlent  or  ongranted  to  end  users  at  below  market  rates.  However,  this  will  not  distort  the \nfinancial  markets,  as  the  end  users  under  the  Project  do  not  have  any  access  to  commercial \nfinancing.  Due  diligence  of  development  subprojects  to  be  financed  under  the  investment \ncomponent will be carried out by MDF in accordance with established rules and procedures. \n \nThe  potential  risk  associated  will  be  the  difficulty  for  MDF  to  simultaneously  deal  with \n18. \nsignificant  number  of  projects.  This  will  be  mitigated  through  the  capacity  development \ncomponent  that  will  assist  development  of  MDF\u2019s  long-term  vision,  corporate  strategy,  and \nrevised business model.   \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\n19. \nThe  proposed  financing  is  primarily  required  to  finance  urban  transport  and  traffic \nmanagement interventions identified by Georgian municipalities and to respond flexibly to other \nmunicipal  infrastructure  priorities.  The  indicative  list  of  urban  transport  subprojects  under  the \nMSDP 2 is in Appendix 4. \n\n \nA. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n20. \nThe  impact  of  this  new  facility  is  to  improve  the  urban  environment  and  public  health, \nand  invigorate  local  economies  in  urban  areas.  The  outcome  will  be  improved  municipal \ninfrastructure,  service  delivery,  and  better  living  conditions.  It  aims  to  promote  economic \ndevelopment by financing urban transport and traffic management measures to (i) improve air \nquality  and  reduce  noise  pollution,  (ii)  improve  access  to  businesses  and  communities, \n(iii) improve the fluidity and capacity of the city road network to reduce travel costs and time to \nmajor  commercial  and  service  centers,  and  (iv)  enable  citizens  to  tap  economic  and  social \nopportunities. It will support the Government\u2019s efforts to enhance economic growth. \n  \n\n                                                                                                                                                          \n \n\npriorities and systems. The World Bank has adopted a similar approach in Georgia under its three loans to MDF \n(Municipal Development and Decentralization Project I, II and III) that has proven to be effective. \n\n \n\n\fTo  support  the  flexibility  and  responsiveness  of  the  MSDP  2,  a  number  of  urban \n21. \nmunicipal subsectors are proposed for possible financing. These include urban transport, water \nsupply,  wastewater,  and  solid  waste  management\u2014all  of  which  might  be  financed  directly  or \nindirectly under the MSDP 2. Reflecting this open and flexible scope, the design and monitoring \nframework includes targets and indicators for all of the above subsectors.  \n \nB. \n\nOutputs \n\nOutputs  include  increased  quality  of  service,  wider  network  coverage,  efficient  and \n22. \nreliable urban services, particularly for urban transport and traffic management, and improved \ncapacity  of  municipalities  and  MDF.  The  MSDP  2  also  aims  to  rehabilitate  and  replace \ndeteriorated equipment and works, and improve municipal services management.  \n \n23. \nTo achieve outputs, and in support of longer-term devolution, the MSDP 2 will focus on \nenhancing  the  capacity  within  MDF  and  municipal  governments  to  (i)  improve  financial  plans \nand  manage  projects,  (ii)  establish  mechanisms  for  system  repair  and  maintenance,  and \n(iii) move  MDF  towards  a  more  sustainable  municipal  financing  institution.  These  basic  policy \ndirections  are  unlikely  to  change,  and  are  expected  to  be  reflected  in  Georgia\u2019s  future  urban \nsector strategy.  \n \nThe  MSDP  2  also  includes  technical  assistance  to  help  participating  municipal \n24. \ngovernments  identify  their  urban  priorities;  undertake  planning  and  projects  feasibilities;  and \nimprove  charges,  accounting,  financial  management,  and  reporting  systems.  It  provides \ninstitutional  strengthening  and  capacity  development  to  the  municipal  governments  to  ensure \nsustainable project benefits. \n \nC. \n\nProject Investment Plan \n\nThe  project  investment  cost  is  estimated  at  $41.50  million  including  taxes  and  duties, \n25. \nphysical and price contingencies and financing charges during implementation of $7.41 million. \nA summary of the cost estimates is in Table 1, and detailed cost estimates are in Appendix 5. \n\nTable 1: Project Investment Plan \n($ million) \n\nItem \n\nA. \n \n \n \n \n\nB. \n\n \nBase Costb \n1. \nInvestment Projects \n2.

The  ADF  financing  has  a  32-year  term,  including  a  grace  period  of \n8 years, and interest charge of 1.6% per annum. \n\nThe  Government  and  the  municipal governments  will  finance  $11.50  million  (27.72%). \n\n27. \nThe financing plan is summarized in Table 2, and detailed in Appendix 5. \n\nTable 2: Financing Plan \n($ million) \n\nSource \nAsian Development Bank \nMunicipal Development Fund  \nMunicipal Governments \nCentral Government \n\n \n\nTotal \n30.00 \n3.00 \n6.61 \n1.89 \n41.50 \n\n% \n72.28 \n7.23 \n15.92 \n4.57 \n100.00 \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n \n \nThe  Government  will  make  the  proceeds  of  the  ADB  loan  available  to  MDF  on  a \n28. \nnonrefundable basis. Under the investment component, ADB loan proceeds will be passed on \nto  eligible  municipal  governments  (Appendix  6).  There  will  be  two  financing  windows:  (i) \ncombination of loans and grants to the financially stronger municipalities of Georgia that have \nthe  capacity  to  borrow,  and  (ii)  grants  to  the  financially  weaker  municipal  governments  that \nhave limited or zero capacity to borrow. \n\n29. \nUnder  window  1,  MDF  will  require  that  a  minimum  of  20%  of  the  subproject  cost  be \ncontributed  by  a  municipal  government,  and  will  finance  the  balance  as  a  loan  and  a  grant; \n50% of a subproject cost will be financed by a loan from MDF, and 30% as a grant from MDF. \nMDF will finance about 24% of the loan portion under window 1 from its own resources. Under \nwindow 2, 85% of a subproject cost will be financed by a grant from  MDF and the  remaining \n15%  will  be  a  contribution  by  the  municipal  government.  ADB  loan  proceeds  will  be  used  to \nfinance all grants portions and 76% of the loan portion. It is estimated that about $17.24 million \nof the ADB loan will be allocated to window 1, with the remaining to window 2. \n\nAbout  80%  of  capacity  development  component  costs  will  be  financed  by  MDF  using \n30. \nthe  ADB  loan  and  the  balance  from  the  central  Government.  Based  on  the  current  practice, \n85% of the incremental administration4 cost of MDF will be financed by ADB, and the balance \nby  central  government.  The  Government  will  finance  the  interest  during  construction  for  both \nloans. \n\n31. \nExcept  as  otherwise  agreed,  subloans  from  MDF  to  municipal  governments  will  be  in \nlari  and  will  be  repayable  in  the  same  currency  over  a  period  of  up  to  10  years,  including  a \ngrace  period  of  up  to  1.5  years  to  cover  the  construction  period.  MDF  will  charge  interest  of \n12% on these loans to include provisions for credit risks (defaults), cost of MDF administration \nand other operational expenses, and a margin of profit.  \n\n                                                 \n \n4 Incremental administration finances temporary staff, studies, and expertise. \n\n \n\n\fE. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n1. \n\nProject Management \n\nExecuting  Agency.  As  structured  in  the  MSDP  1,  MDF  will  be  the  executing  agency \n32. \nresponsible  for  overall  implementation,  monitoring,  and  disbursement  for  MSDP  2.  MDF  was \nestablished  in  1997  under  Presidential  Decree  No.  294.  MDF  is  a  government-owned  entity, \noperates its own accounts, and prepares independent financial statements. MDF was set up to \nstrengthen the institutional and financial capacities of municipal governments by financing local \ninfrastructure investments and capacity development projects. MDF disburses loans and grants \nto municipal governments using funds from international financial institutions and governmental \nagencies. Since 2002, MDF has generated its own revenue from loan repayments by municipal \ngovernments and is now relending some of these funds. \n\n33. \nA  financial  management  assessment  of  MDF  was  undertaken.  Based  on  the  balance \nsheets  and  income  statements  projected  for  2008\u20132018,  MDF  has  sufficient  cash  to  support \nthe  required  contributions  to  the  Project,  and  continues  to  be  profitable.  MDF\u2019s  strategic  plan \nwas completed in 2008 and should be approved at the next board meeting scheduled for mid-\n2009.  This  strategic  plan  forms  the  basis  of  a  business  plan  with  a  long-term  vision.  The \nobjective  is  a  financially  sustainable  MDF,  which  over  time  will  become  less  dependent  on \ndevelopment partner financing.  \n\n34. \nImplementing Agency. MDF will be the implementing agency. With a multidisciplinary \norganization  of  107  experienced  specialists,  it  has  performed  well,  has  capacity  for  project \nimplementation, and is currently recruiting staff to absorb new project load. Details of MDF are \nin Appendix 7. \n\n35. \nExisting project implementation arrangements will remain the same and are detailed in \nthe  PAM  of  the  MSDP  1.  This  PAM  was  adopted  by  MDF  as  the  operations  manual  in \nDecember  2008.  It  includes  policies  and  procedures  to  be  followed  during  implementation  of \nthe Project. It describes the rules and procedures governing MDF business activities and MDF \nrelations with its clients under MSDP 2 financing. \n\nEligible  Municipal  Governments. All municipal governments within Georgia are likely \n\n36. \nto be eligible to participate in the Project (Appendix 8). \n\nEligible  Investment  Projects.  The  list  of  subprojects  which  inter  alia  may  be \n37. \nconsidered  for  funding  under  the  MSDP  2  is  in  Appendix  4.  Once  these  projects  have  been \nfinanced, the remaining funds may be used for any of the following subsectors: (i) water supply, \nincluding  resource  development  and  improvement;  (ii)  sewerage  collection  and  treatment;  (iii) \nwaste  water  system  and  solid  waste  collection  and  disposal;  (iv)  local  road  improvement, \nincluding  drainage  and  street  lighting;  (v)  traffic  management  and  public  transport;  and  (vi) \nother  municipal  services.  Subprojects  for  other  categories  may  be  considered  by  prior \nagreement  with  ADB.  Only  subprojects  meeting  general  eligibility  criteria  (Appendix  8), \nincluding ADB safeguards, will be eligible for financing under the MSDP 2. \n\nPooling  of  smaller  but  related  and  contiguous  projects  may  be  allowed  to  meet  the \n\n38. \nminimum investment requirement.  \n\nInvestment Project Preparation and Appraisal. The investment project cycle follows \n\n39. \nthat of MDF and comprises \n\n    7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\npreliminary review of the proposal; \nfeasibility work; \nappraisal by MDF of the proposed investments; \nfinancial proposal and request for approval by the MDF supervisory board; \nsigning of investment financing agreement with the municipal government; \nprocurement and implementation of the subproject; and  \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n(iv) \n(v) \n(vi) \n(vii)  monitoring and evaluation.  \n \nAppraisal of investment projects by MDF will be undertaken on the basis of quantitative \n40. \nand  qualitative  criteria  defined  in  the  operations  manual  and  will  cover  technical,  financial, \neconomic,  environmental,  social,  and  institutional  aspects.  This  will  rationalize  acceptance  or \nrejection for financing by MDF. The appraisal report for any subproject exceeding $2 million will \nbe  sent  to  ADB  for  approval  on  a  no-objection  basis.  The  detailed  steps  for  preparation  and \nappraisal of subprojects and necessary studies to be prepared are in Appendix 9. \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Period \n\n41. \nThis facility will be implemented over 5 years from 2009 to end of 2013 (Appendix 10). \nThis is considered realistic because the project implementation structure is already in place and \npreparatory works, including the operations manual, are underway. \n\n3. \n\nProcurement \n\n42. \nAll  procurement  financed  under  the  Project  will  follow  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines \n(2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  Contracts  for  civil  works  of  more  than  $1  million \nequivalent  and  contracts  for  goods  more  than  $500,000  equivalent  will  be  procured  using \ninternational  competitive  bidding  procedures.  Civil  works  contracts  that  cost  $1  million \nequivalent  or  less,  and  contracts  for  procurement  of  goods  between  $100,000  and  $500,000 \nequivalent,  will  be  carried  out  through  national  competitive  bidding.  The  national  competitive \nbidding will be conducted in accordance with ADB guidelines and as indicated in section C of \nthe procurement plan (Appendix 11). \n\nGoods  contracts  less  than  $100,000  equivalent  will  be  carried  out  through  shopping \n43. \nprocedures.  Goods  and  civil  works valued  up  to  $10,000 may  be  purchased  directly  from  the \nsupplier  and  contractor.  In  such  cases,  ADB  should  be  satisfied  that  the  price  paid  is \nreasonable. The award of all contracts will be subject to prior approval by ADB, except small \ncontracts  under  the  shopping  and  direct  contracting  procedures.  Experience  under  the  other \nprojects implemented by MDF shows that it is able to handle procurement effectively and in a \ntimely manner. Because of the nature of the Project, the scope of individual subprojects will be \nknown only during project implementation. However, estimates of required goods, works, and \nservices  have  been  carried  out  and  a  preliminary  procurement  plan  has  been  prepared \n(Appendix  11).  This  will  be  revised  and  updated  annually  or  as  needed  throughout  project \nimplementation. \n\n4. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n44. \nSelecting and engaging consulting services will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines \non  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)  and  the  procurement  plan: \n(i) quality  and  cost-based  selection;  (ii)  quality-based  selection;  (iii)  consultants\u2019  qualifications \nselection  for  small  consultancy  assignments  that  cost  less  than  $200,000  per  contract; \n(iv) least-cost  selection  for  very  small  consulting  assignments  that  cost  less  than  $100,000; \n\n \n\n\f(v) fixed  budget  selection;  and  (vi)  single  source  selection  and  ADB  individual  consultant \nprocedures for selection of individual national or international consultants for the following types \nof assignments: environmental, social, tariff, and operation and maintenance (O&M) studies. \n\n5. \n\nAdvance Contracting and Retroactive Financing \n\n45. \nTo  facilitate  project  implementation,  ADB  Management  approved,  in  principle,  advance \ncontracting  and  retroactive  financing  to  be  utilized  for  eligible  expenditures  financed  by  under \nthe  Project.  Advance  contracting  allows  the  Government  to  commence  procurement  activities, \nat  its  own  risk,  prior  to  the  signing  of  the  relevant  loan  agreement.  The  Government  was \ninformed  that,  in  order  for  expenses  incurred  under  advance  contracting  to  be  eligible  for \nretroactive  financing,  such  procedures  (including  advertising)  must  comply  with  ADB\u2019s \nProcurement  Guidelines  and  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants.  Once  the  loan  becomes \neffective,  up  to  20%  of  such  loan  proceeds  may  be  used  to  retroactively  finance  eligible \nexpenditures incurred during the period not exceeding 12 months prior to the signing of the loan \nagreement.  Alternatively,  the  Government  may  also  opt  for  advance  contracting  without \nretroactive  financing,  in  which  case,  the  procurement  procedures  completed  under  advance \ncontracting  do  not  conclude  with  the  award  of  contract  until  after  the  loan  becomes  effective. \nThe  Government  acknowledges \nthe  procedures, \ndocumentation, or proposal for award does not commit to ADB to finance such expenses or the \nrelated project. \n \n\nthat  any  concurrence  by  ADB  with \n\n6. \n\nAnticorruption Policy  \n\nADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was  explained  to  and \n46. \ndiscussed with the Government and MDF. Consistent with its commitment to good governance, \naccountability,  and  transparency,  ADB  reserves  the  right  to  investigate,  directly  or  through  its \nagents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the Project. \nTo support these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the \nloan regulations and the bidding documents for the Project. In particular, all contracts financed \nby  ADB  in  connection  with  the  Project  shall  include  provisions  specifying  the  right  of  ADB  to \naudit and examine the records and accounts of MDF and all contractors, suppliers, consultants, \nand other service providers as they relate to the Project. \n\n7. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\nThe  loan  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement \n47. \nHandbook (2007, as amended from time to time). MDF, upon loan effectiveness, will establish \nand operate an imprest account for the MSDP 2 in the Treasury or a bank acceptable to ADB. \nThe imprest account will be exclusively used to finance the ADB share of eligible expenditures. \nThe imprest account will be established, managed, replenished, and liquidated in accordance \nwith  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook.  The  initial  amount  to  be  deposited  in  the  imprest \naccount  will  not  exceed  the  estimated  project  expenditures  to  be  financed  from  the  imprest \naccount  for  the  next  6  months,  or  10%  of  the  loan  amount,  whichever  is  lower.  To  expedite \nfunds flow and simplify the documentation process, the statement of expenditures process will \nbe used for replenishment and liquidation of the imprest account and reimbursement of eligible \nexpenditures,  not  exceeding  $200,000  per  individual  payment.  The  payment  in  excess  of  the \nstatement  of  expenditures  ceiling  will  be  reimbursed,  liquidated,  or  replenished  based  on  the \nfull supporting documentation process. \n\n    9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\nTo  facilitate  municipal  governments'  project  implementation  and  disbursement,  for  the \n48. \nsubloan  and  grant  from  MDF  to  municipal  governments  in  lari,  ADB's  subloan  approval  and \nwithdrawal procedure may be used. For a subproject in the amount not exceeding $2,000,000 \neligible  for  financing  under  the  project  financing  facility  component,  the  subloan  approval  and \nwithdrawal  procedure  may  be  used  in  accordance  with  the  ADB's  Loan  Disbursement \nHandbook,  provided  that  a  related  subproject  summary  report  is  submitted  together  with  the \nwithdrawal  application  in  form  and  substance  satisfactory  to  ADB.    For  a  subproject  in  the \namount  equal  to  or  exceeding  $2,000,000  eligible  for  financing  under  the  project  financing \nfacility  component,  ADB's  prior  review  and  approval  of  the  related  subproject  appraisal  report \nand investment financing agreement will be required prior to disbursement in accordance with \nthe ADB's Loan Disbursement Handbook. \n \n\n8. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n49.  MDF will maintain a separate account for the Project acceptable to ADB. MDF will have \nits  account  and  financial  statements  (balance  sheet,  income  statement,  and  statement  of \nsources and application of funds) audited annually in accordance with sound and internationally \naccepted  auditing  standards  by  independent  external  auditors  acceptable  to  ADB.  MDF  will \nsubmit  to  ADB,  not  later  than  6  months  after  the  close  of  each  financial  year,  (i)  its  audited \nfinancial  statements;  and  (ii)  the  auditor\u2019s  report  relating  to  supplementary  information  on \nMDF\u2019s accounts, including an assessment of the quality of its long-term loans, the adequacy of \nthe  provision  for  doubtful  loans,  and  MDF\u2019s  corporate  and  financial  governance  practices.  A \nseparate  audit  opinion  on  the  use  of  the  imprest  account  and  statement  of  expenditures \nprocedures  should  be  included  in  the  audit  report.  Delay  in  submission  of  audited  financial \nstatements of acceptable quality may result in ADB suspending loan disbursements. \n\n50.  MDF will provide ADB with (i) a biannual progress report on project performance within \n2  weeks  after  the  end  of  each  semester  that  will  include  information  on  the  loan  funds \nutilization,  subloans  and  grants,  procurement  activities,  and  other  matters  relating  to  the \nProject;  (ii)  a  projected  annual  disbursement  schedule,  broken  down  by  quarters  by \n15 December  each  year;  (iii)  a  project  completion  report  within  6  months  of  the  loan  closing \ndate detailing project implementation, project costs, subloan repayments, financial conditions of \nMDF,  and  other  details  that  ADB  may  consider  necessary;  and  (iv)  updated  3-year  financial \nprojections of MDF by 31 December each year. \n\n9. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n51.  MDF will ensure that a project management and information system is maintained at the \nstart of project implementation. This will help monitor and evaluate the technical performance \nand  social  and  economic  benefits  of  the  Project  at  6-month  intervals.  The  performance \nmonitoring indicators and procedures will be established, and revised as necessary. At the start \nof  the  Project,  MDF,  together  with  participating  municipal  governments  will  identify  baseline \nindicators that focus on project municipal services delivery and financial capacity. \n\nAs part of the quality assurance process, ADB reserves the right to undertake random \n\n52. \nchecks on how ADB funds are managed and projects selected. \n\n10. \n\nProject Review \n\n53. \nthereafter.  ADB  and \n\nReview missions will be undertaken twice a year for the first 2 years and once a year \nthe  Government  will  undertake  a  midterm  review  after  project \n\n \n\n\fimplementation  begins.  This  will  include  a  detailed  evaluation  of  the  scope,  implementation \narrangements,  and  progress  in  achieving  scheduled  targets,  and  compliance  with  loan \ncovenants.  Feedback  from  the  project  processing  monitoring  system  will  be  analyzed. \nIntermittent  \u201cspot  checks\u201d  on  the  performance  of  MDF  will  also  be  undertaken  to  ensure  all \nactivities  under  the  ADB-financed  program  are  in  line  with  ADB\u2019s  policies  and  guidelines, \nparticularly with respect to the environment and social safeguards. \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\nA. \n\nBenefits and Impacts \n\n54. \nThe  Project  will  directly  benefit  the  municipal  population  in  terms  of  health  and  living \nconditions  resulting  from  (i)  an  efficient,  safer,  and  more  reliable  urban  transport  system; \n(ii) reduced  congestion  and  better  mobility  between  housing  clusters  and  economic  activities; \n(iii) improved living conditions with a cleaner environment and reduced noise; and (iv) improved \nroad  conditions  and  reduced  road  accidents.  The  economies  of  these  municipalities  will  also \nbenefit  indirectly  from  enhanced  productivity  by  attracting  investors,  improving  health,  and \nincreasing efficiency through improved roads and public transport. \n\n55. \nThe  Project  is  also  expected  to  (i)  strengthen  public  trust  in  participating  municipal \ngovernments  by  rehabilitating  municipal  infrastructure;  (ii)  improve  access  to  urban  transport \nservices by local populations, including the most vulnerable groups (women, children, and poor \nhouseholds);  (iii) \nlocal \ninfrastructure;  and  (iv)  increase  participation  and  ownership  by  municipal  governments  and \ncommunities.  \n\nincrease  employment  opportunities 5  after \n\nthe  rehabilitation  of \n\n56. \nRehabilitating  systems  will  lead  to  significant  savings  in  municipal  infrastructure  O&M \ncosts  and  more  efficient  O&M  procedures.  The  Project  will  also  have  a  positive  impact  on \nemployment  creation  from  the  work  involved  in  construction  and  rehabilitation,  together  with \nO&M.  Training  and  technical  assistance  under  the  Project  will  enhance  the  productivity  of \nmunicipal governments and MDF personnel.  \n\nThe Project will benefit MDF and increase its exposure to structuring projects and ADB \n57. \noperations.  Project  support  for  coordination  and  implementation  will  increase  the  capacity  of \nMDF to manage fund flows and specialist services to municipal governments. As MDF\u2019s project \nportfolio grows, some additional training and technical assistance in financial management is to \nbe provided to turn MDF into a more sustainable municipal financing entity. \n\n58. \nThe  Project  will  benefit  municipalities  through  the  provision  of  loans,  grants,  and \ntechnical  assistance.  The  Project  reinforces  the  role  of  local  participation  that  will  enhance \naccountability and transparency. It will help build capacity at the local level by providing hands-\non training and specialist advice. \n\n59. \nEconomic  Analysis.  The  economic  analysis  framework  prepared  and  used  for  the \nMSDP 1 (Appendix 12) will continue to be used for the MSDP 2. All subprojects to be financed \nunder the Project are required to demonstrate an expected positive economic outcome in line \nwith  ADB\u2019s  guidelines  on  economic  analysis.6 This  framework  covers  the  scope  of  economic \nanalysis, quantifiable benefits expected from each type of investment, identifiable externalities, \n                                                 \n \n5 About 200\u2013300 jobs will be generated by the urban transport projects financed under the MSDP 2. \n6 ADB. 1997. Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects. Manila.  \n\n    11 \n\n \n\n\f12 \n\n \n\nand methodologies for conducting the economic analysis. It is incorporated into the operations \nmanual to guide the economic analysis of each subproject.  \n\n60. \nResettlement  and  Indigenous  Peoples.  As  for  the  MSDP  1,  the  MSDP  2  will  only \nfinance  projects  entailing  the  repair,  rehabilitation,  construction  or  modernization  of  existing \nfacilities and infrastructure that do not require land acquisition or resettlement. The ADB policy \non involuntary resettlement will not be triggered by this project.  \n\nAs  there  is  no  group  fitting  the  ADB  definition  of  indigenous  peoples  in  Georgia,  the \n61. \npolicy  will  not  be  triggered  by  the  MSDP  2.  The  selection  criteria  for  the  contractors  for  civil \nworks in the projects will include strict adherence to the applicable labor laws and regulations of \nGeorgia.  \n\n62. \nEnvironmental  Aspects.  The  Project  is  designed  to  maximize  environmental  and \npublic  health  benefits.  The  MSDP  2  net  environmental  benefits  are  positive,  including  better \npublic  health,  reduced exposure  to  suspended  particles,  reduced  exposure  to  noise  pollution, \npreservation  of  cultural  heritage,  improved  access  to  employment  opportunities,  and  reduced \nflooding through drainage improvements.  \n\n63. \nThe  negative  environmental  impact  during  construction  and  operation  will  not  be \nsignificant because construction will be planned by phase, with a specific temporary traffic plan. \nMost  projects  will  actually  divert  and  regulate  traffic,  and  simple  technologies  with  low \nmaintenance requirements will be selected when possible. However, exceptions may be made \nto include some environmentally sensitive investments if well justified. \n\n64. \nA  detailed  description  of  the  environmental  assessment  and  review  framework  for  the \ninvestment  subprojects  is  in  Appendix  13.  For  each  investment  subproject,  MDF  and  the \nmunicipal  governments  will  be  responsible  for  applying  the  prescribed  framework  prepared  in \n(2003)  and  covering \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Environmental  Assessment  Guidelines \nenvironmental  screening,  classification  (using  ADB\u2019s  rapid  environmental  assessment \nchecklists),  assessment  and  implementation  of  the  environmental  management  plan  (EMP) \nthat  ensures  that  adverse  impacts  are  minimized  and  mitigated.  MDF  and  the  borrowing \nmunicipal governments will conduct the environmental monitoring in accordance with the plans \nand  schedules  outlined  in  the  EMP.  The  monitoring  results  will  be  included  as  part  of  the \nprogress report and submitted to ADB on a semiannual basis. \n\nConsultation  and  Civil  Society.  The  main  stakeholders  will  be  MDF,  participating \n65. \nmunicipal  governments,  communities,  and  civil  society  organizations.  MDF  and  participating \nmunicipal  governments  will  ensure  that  for  all  subprojects,  the  results  of  social  assessments \nand  stakeholder  consultations  will  be  adequately  taken  into  account  in  identifying  investment \npriorities.  Consultation  will  be  carried  out  through  public  hearings,  surveys,  workshops,  and \nother meetings during project implementation and monitoring. \n\n66.  MDF  will  be  responsible  for  undertaking  and  providing  adequate  resources  for  project \nmonitoring,  including  social  development  outcomes.  The  assessment  of  social  issues  cannot \nbe completed until the start of subproject feasibility. MDF will ensure that a social assessment \nis  carried  out  in  cooperation  with  the  participating  municipality  to  (i)  identify  possible  social \nissues, including  gender,  vulnerability,  labor,  affordability,  and  other  social  risks, if applicable; \n(ii)  identify  measures  to  avoid  or  minimize  these  risks;  and  (iii)  ensure  that  the  proposed \nsubproject  is  tailored  to  the  needs  and  priorities  of  the  participating  community  as  identified \nthrough  the  consultation  process.  A  summary  poverty  reduction  and  social  strategy  is  in \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 14. \n \n67.  MDF  and  participating  municipal  governments  will  furthermore  ensure  that  there  is  no \ndifferential payment between men and women for work of equal value, and no child labor will \nbe employed in the construction or maintenance activities. \n\nB. \n\nRisks \n\nThe potential risks associated with the Project include (i) MDF unable to find skilled and \n68. \nexperienced  staff  to  manage  and  monitor  project  implementation,  (ii)  municipal  governments \nunable \ninvestments,  and  (iii) \narrangements for the O&M of subproject assets not implemented effectively. \n\nto  provide  required  counterpart  contributions \n\nfor  MDF \n\n69. \nThe  Project  includes  measures  to mitigate  these  risks.  Incremental  administration and \nproject  management  have  been  included  to  support  MDF  and  finance  temporary  staff  and \nexpertise. Financial eligibility criteria for participating municipal governments during preparation \nwill ensure counterpart contributions. For the latter risk, the capacity development component \nof the Project is designed to provide consulting services to cover legal and/or technical aspects \nof  O&M  planning  and  funding.  Any  risk  associated  with  overall  project  implementation  is \nmitigated  by  MDF\u2019s  considerable  experience  in  implementing  internationally  funded  projects. \nMoreover,  ADB  review  missions  will  monitor  these  mitigation  measures  and  help  to  ensure \nsustainability of the Project. \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  and  MDF  have  committed  to \n\n70. \nthe following, which will be incorporated in the Project\u2019s legal documents: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nThe  Government,  MDF,  and  the  participating  municipal  governments  will  make \navailable and release in a timely manner all counterpart funds necessary for project \nimplementation. \nMDF  will  carry  out  the  Project  in  accordance  with  the  operations  manual.  The \nmodified  PAM  will  act  as  operations  manual,  which  covers  the  policies  and \nprocedures  during  project  implementation.  It  describes  the  rules  governing  MDF \nbusiness  activities  and  its  relations  with  its  clients  and  as  they  relate  to  project \nfinancing.  No  revisions  to  the  operations  manual  will  be  made  effective  without \nADB\u2019s prior approval. \nSubprojects to be financed under the Project will meet the eligibility criteria set forth \nin Appendix 8. \n\nthe  applicable  environmental \n\n(iv)  MDF  will  ensure  that  each  investment  project  under  the  Project  (a)  is selected  and \nappraised  in  accordance  with  the  agreed  eligibility  criteria,  and  (b)  carried  out  in \ncompliance  with \nthe \nGovernment  and  ADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy  (2002).  Appraisal  reports  for  the \nsubproject  estimated  to  cost  more  than  $2  million  will  be  submitted  to  ADB  for \napproval. \nThe environmental assessment and review framework (Appendix 13) will be followed \nin  conducting  environmental  assessment  of  subprojects  during  project \nimplementation. In this regard, MDF will screen and classify subprojects following the \nADB  agreed  checklist.  MDF  will  ensure  that  environmental  assessment  will  be \nconducted,  and  environmental  management  plan  will  be  developed,  as  necessary. \nMDF  will  obtain  necessary  permits  and  approvals.  The  municipal  governments  will \n\nlaws  and  regulations  of \n\n(v) \n\n    13 \n\n \n\n\f14 \n\n \n\nlogistical  and \n\nthe  necessary \n\nfor  conducting \n\ntechnical  support \n\nthe \nprovide \nenvironmental  impact  assessments  (EIAs).  MDF  will  submit  the  EIA  for  category  A \nsubprojects  or  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE)  for  category  B  sensitive \nsubprojects  to  ADB  for  review  and  clearance.  MDF  will  ensure  that  the  subproject \nEIAs  and  IEEs  will  get  the  appropriate  Ministry  of  Environment\u2019s  review  and \napproval.  MDF  will  ensure  that  the  EMP  will  be  included  in  bidding  and  contract \ndocuments  for  subprojects.  MDF  and  the  borrowing  municipal  governments  will \nconduct  the  environmental  monitoring  in  accordance  with  the  plans  and  schedules \noutlined in the EMP. The monitoring results will be included as part of the progress \nreport and submitted to ADB on a semiannual basis. \nEach subproject will be implemented in accordance with sound administrative, social, \nenvironmental, and governance principles. \nAll subprojects under the Project will be carried out within the existing rights-of-way \nand  no  subprojects  will  involve  any  land  acquisition  and/or  resettlement  that  would \ntrigger  ADB\u2019s  Involuntary  Resettlement  Policy  (1995).  Any  subproject  that  involves \nland acquisition and/or resettlement will not be eligible for ADB financing. \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\n(viii)  Social assessment of subprojects will be carried out in a socially responsible manner \n\nseeking mitigation of any potential social risks. \n\n(ix)  MDF will annually update its medium-term strategic plans including action plans. \n(x) \n\nAll  contracts  financed  from  the  loan  proceeds  under  the  Project  will  include \nprovisions  specifying  the  right  of  ADB  to  audit  and  examine  project-related  records \nand  accounts  of  MDF,  all  contractors,  consultants,  and  other  service  providers.  In \nline  with  the  principles  of  transparency,  accountability  and  anticorruption,  MDF  will \nenhance and further develop its website to provide the public with information on the \nProject,  major  activities,  procurement  activities,  lists  of  participating  bidders  and \nconsultants, names of the winning bidders and consultants, basic details on bidding \nand  recruitment  procedures  adopted,  amounts  of  the  contracts  awarded,  the  list  of \ngoods and/or services purchased, and their intended use. \n\n(xi)  MDF  will  ensure  that  the  project  management  and  information  system  will  be \nmaintained within MDF and each of the participating municipal governments. At the \nstart  of  the  Project,  MDF  together  with  participating  municipal  governments  will \nidentify  baseline  indicators  that  focus  on  project  municipal  services  delivery  and \nfinancial capacity.  \n\nVI. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\nI am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \n71. \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and,  acting  in  the  absence  of  the  President,  under  the \nprovisions  of  Article  35.1  of  the  Articles  of  Agreement  of  ADB,  I  recommend  that  the  Board \napprove  the  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to  Special  Drawing  Rights  19,374,000  to \nGeorgia for the Municipal Services Development Project \u2013 Phase 2 from ADB\u2019s Special Funds \nresources, with an interest charge at the rate of 1.6% per annum; a term of 32 years, including a \ngrace period of 8 years, and such other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance \nwith those set forth in the draft Loan and Project Agreements presented to the Board. \n \n\n \nC.

\n\nMUNICIPAL DEVELOPMENT FUND OF GEORGIA \n\nA. \n\nBackground \n\nThe Municipal Development Fund of Georgia (MDF) was established on 7 June 1997 by \n1. \nthe  Government  of  Georgia  under  Presidential  Decree  No.  294  (on  management  of  funds \ndesignated  for  the  development  of  the  municipal  sector  in  Georgia)  as  a  legal  entity  of  public \nlaw.  It  was  set  up  to  implement  the  first  Municipal  Development  and  Decentralization  Project \n(MDDP) financed by the World Bank. MDF\u2019s charter has been revised since then on a number of \noccasions, when new projects were negotiated or activities transferred.1 The latest revision was \nunder  Presidential  Decree  No.  118  (on  approval  of  the  charter  and  the  supervisory  board  of \nMDF) in 2005. \n \n2. \nMDF  operates  in  accordance  with  (i)  its  charter;  (ii)  the  provisions  of  the  Law  on  Legal \nEntity of Public Law of 28 May 1999; (iii) other laws, orders, and decrees; (iv) agreements of the \nGovernment  and  a  number  of  international  multilateral  and  bilateral  financial  institutions;  and \n(v) its operations manual. MDF is a financially autonomous entity, operates its own special and \ncurrent accounts in a commercial bank, prepares independent financial statements, and has its \nown seal. Its head office is in Tbilisi and the financial year is from 1 January to 31 December. \n \nThe main responsibilities of MDF include (i) providing funds for development of municipal \n3. \ninfrastructure  and  services,  and  (ii)  strengthening  the  institutional  and  financial  capacity  of \nmunicipal  governments.  MDF  functions  as  a  project  implementing  agency  for  a  number  of \nforeign-assisted  and  locally  funded  projects.  It  accesses  funds  from  multilateral  and  bilateral \nfunding bodies, international aid agencies, and central and local governments. Foreign funds are \nusually  released  to  MDF  through  the  Ministry  of  Finance  on  a  non  refundable  basis  in  the \ncurrency  of  the  financer.  MDF  onlends  or  releases  these  funds  as  grants  in  lari  for  capital \ninvestments  and  capacity  development  of  municipal  governments.  MDF  has  extensive \nexperience  of,  and  considerable  capacity  for,  project  implementation.  It  has  performed  well  in \nimplementing a number of foreign-funded projects. \n \n4. \nMDF  is  a  government  institution.  It  is  neither  a  commercial  nor  a  development  bank;  it \nreceives  no  customers\u2019  deposits  and  receives  most  of  its  funds  as  grants  from  central \ngovernment  and  through  collection  of  loan  repayments  from  municipal  governments.  It  has  no \noutstanding long-term debts.  \n \nB. \n\nOrganizational Structure and Internal Management Procedures \n\n1. \n\nOrganization and Staffing \n\n \n5. \nMDF is accountable to the Government through its supervisory board. Coordination and \noverall  management  of  its  activities  is  undertaken  by  the  supervisory  board  appointed  by  the \nGovernment and chaired by the Prime Minister. The role and responsibilities of the supervisory \nboard  are  defined  by  Presidential  Decree  No.  210  dated  3  May  2002  and  Presidential  Decree \n\n                                                 \n \n1   For  example,  the  charter  was  revised  under  Presidential  Decree  No.  210  of  3  May  2002  and  No.  409  of \n24 September  2002  to  implement  the  MDDP  II.  Under  Presidential  Decree  No.  1027  of  6  December  2005,  the \nGeorgian Social Investment Fund  was merged  with MDF. Presidential Decree No. 246 of 8 June 2006 added the \nnonproject grant funded by the Government of Japan. Later, under Presidential Decree No. 128 of 30 June 2006, \nthe Irrigation and Drainage Consumers Organizations Development Project was merged with MDF. \n\n \n\n\f26  Appendix 7 \n \n\n \n\nNo.  409  dated  24  September  2002.  The  latest composition  of  the  supervisory  board  has  been \nprescribed in Government of Georgia Decree No. 269, dated 5 December 2007 with the prime \nminister as the chairperson and nine other members2 all of whom are appointed and dismissed \nby  the  President  of  Georgia.  MDF  is  headed  by  an  executive  director  who  reports  to  the \nsupervisory  board  and  is  supported  by  four  senior  managers  of  the  departments  of  irrigation, \nsocial  investment,  investment  and  loans,  and  administration.  MDF  has  a  total  of  107  staff  and \nconsultants  as  of  early  March  2009.  MDF  aims  to  increase  staff  numbers  as  the  number  of \nprojects  it  is  implementing  increases.  The  present  organization  and  staffing  chart  is  shown  as \nFigure A7. \n \n\n2. \n\nManagement Policies  \n\nManagement  policies  are  set  out  in  several  operations  manuals  prepared  for  different \n6. \nprograms. For example, MDF has an operations manual for the World Bank-funded MDDP, the \nGeorgian Social Investment Fund (GSIF) Project, and the Regional Infrastructure Development \nProject  of  the  Millennium  Challenge  Georgia  Fund.  MDF  does  not  have  a  core  operations \nmanual,  so  the  project  administration  manual  for  the  Municipal  Services  Development  Project \n(MSDP I) has been adopted as operations manual for management of Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) funds.  \n \nThe  operations  manuals  are  comprehensive  documents  and  set  out  MDF\u2019s \n7. \norganizational structure and internal management procedures, covering a general overview of its \n(i)  activities;  (ii)  organizational  structure  and  staffing  plan;  (iii)  personnel  management \nprocedures,  involving  general  principles,  employment  contracts,  professional  responsibility, \nconflict of interest, and code of behavior; (iv) financial management; and (v) reporting. They also \ndetail  MDF\u2019s  activities  and  business  procedures,  including  (i)  the  nature  of  business  products; \n(ii) investment  project  financing  and  technical  assistance  financing;  (iii)  investment  financing; \n(iv) eligibility  criteria  for  projects  and  entities;  (v)  project  preparation  cycle;  (vi)  project \nimplementation,  covering  procurement  guidelines,  implementation  supervision,  and  monitoring \nand  evaluation;  and  (vii)  project  financial  management  focusing  on  special  accounts,  local \ncurrency accounts, and accounting procedures. \n \nThe Finance Department uses a well-drafted and comprehensive financial management \n8. \nmanual  (updated  January  2007).  This  outlines  (i)  the  organizational  management  structure, \nroles,  and  responsibilities  for  financial  management;  (ii)  the  legal  requirements  for  financial \nreporting, and internal regulations for things such as time sheets, vacation and sick leave, travel \nallowances,  and  vehicle  expenses;  (iii)  flow  of  funds  arrangements,  including  special  account  \noperational  procedures  and  flows  of  documents;  (iv)  budgeting  procedures,  including  the  time \nframe  and  responsibilities;  (v)  the  accounting  system  covering  objectives  and  principles, \naccounting policies and rules, loans, payroll processing, and a description of the computerized \naccounting  system  and  the  treatment  of  operational  expenditures;  (vi)  financial  reporting  and \nmonitoring,  describing  reports  to  be  produced  and  their  frequency;  (vii)  internal  control \nprocedures  that  set  out  the  principles,  appropriate  documentation  of  policies,  separation  of \nfunctions, fixed asset control, and pay and payroll matters; and (viii) external control, prescribing \nthe annual audit and selection of auditors, and the requirements of financers and the Georgian \nauthorities. \n                                                 \n \n2   These  are  (i)  the  ministers  of  finance,  economic  development,  education  and  science,  agriculture,  and  regional \naffairs; (ii) the head of the Committee for Agrarian Issues of the Parliament; (iii) the deputy ministers of finance and \nregional  affairs;  and  (iv)  the  executive  directors  of  the  Association  of  Young  Economists  (nongovernment \norganization representative) and of the Millennium Challenge Georgia Fund. \n\n \n\n \n\n\fFigure A7: Organization and Staffing Chart of the Municipal Development Fund of Georgia \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nSupervisory \nSupervisory \nBoard\nBoard\n\nAssistant of \nAssistant of \nExecutive \nExecutive \nDirector\nDirector\n\nGovernment of Georgia\nGovernment of Georgia\nPrime Minister\nPrime Minister\n\nExecutive Director\nExecutive Director\n\nHead of Internal Audit\nHead of Internal Audit\nInternal Audit Specialist\nInternal Audit Specialist\n\nAssistant of \nAssistant of \nAdministrative \nAdministrative \nDepartment \nDepartment \nManager\nManager\n\nManager of Irrigation \nManager of Irrigation \nDepartment\nDepartment\n\nManager of Social \nManager of Social \nInvestment Department\nInvestment Department\n\nManager of Investment and \nManager of Investment and \nLoan Department\nLoan Department\n\nManager of Administrative \nManager of Administrative \nDepartment\nDepartment\n\nInterpreter\nInterpreter\n\nAssistant\nAssistant\n\nInterpreter\nInterpreter\n\nAssistant\nAssistant\n\nInterpreter\nInterpreter\n\nAssistant\nAssistant\n\nHead of the \nHead of the \nAssociation of \nAssociation of \nAmelioration Division\nAmelioration Division\n\nChief Specialist \nChief Specialist \n(West Georgia)\n(West Georgia)\n\nSupport Specialist (2)\nSupport Specialist (2)\n\nChief Specialist \nChief Specialist \n(East Georgia)\n(East Georgia)\n\nSupport Specialist (3)\nSupport Specialist (3)\n\nTraining Specialist\nTraining Specialist\n\nMonitoring Specialist\nMonitoring Specialist\n\nHead of Technical \nHead of Technical \nDivision\nDivision\nProject Management \nProject Management \nSpecialist\nSpecialist\nWork Supervisor (5)\nWork Supervisor (5)\n\nHead of the Project \nHead of the Project \nManagement \nManagement \nMonitoring and \nMonitoring and \nEvaluation Division\nEvaluation Division\n\nProject Management \nProject Management \nSpecialist (3)\nSpecialist (3)\n\nFinancial and Economic \nFinancial and Economic \nAnalysis Specialist\nAnalysis Specialist\n\nHead of Technical \nHead of Technical \nDivision\nDivision\n\nHead of the Project \nHead of the Project \nManagement Monitoring \nManagement Monitoring \nand Evaluation Division\nand Evaluation Division\n\nHead of Information \nHead of Information \nTechnology (IT) \nTechnology (IT) \nDivision\nDivision\n\nProject Management Chief \nProject Management Chief \nSpecialist (2)\nSpecialist (2)\n\nProject Management Senior \nProject Management Senior \nSpecialist\nSpecialist\n\nProject Management Specialist \nProject Management Specialist \n(2)\n(2)\n\nEnvironment Specialist\nEnvironment Specialist\n\nProject Evaluation Chief \nProject Evaluation Chief \nSpecialist\nSpecialist\n\nHead of Technical Division\nHead of Technical Division\n\nProject Management Senior \nProject Management Senior \nSpecialist\nSpecialist\n\nIT Senior Specialist\nIT Senior Specialist\n\nIT Specialist (2)\nIT Specialist (2)\n\nPublic Relations Specialist\nPublic Relations Specialist\n\nChancellery\nChancellery\n\nAdministrative Support \nAdministrative Support \nOfficer (3)\nOfficer (3)\n\nDrivers (8)\nDrivers (8)\n\nCleaners (4)\nCleaners (4)\n\nSource: Municipal Development Fund of Georgia. \n\nWork Supervisor (11)\nWork Supervisor (11)\n\nWork Supervisor (6)\nWork Supervisor (6)\n\nHead of \nHead of \nProcurement \nProcurement \nDivision\nDivision\n\nProcurement \nProcurement \nChief Specialist\nChief Specialist\n\nProcurement \nProcurement \nSenior Specialist\nSenior Specialist\n\nProcurement \nProcurement \nSpecialist\nSpecialist\n\nHead of \nHead of \nFinancial \nFinancial \nDivision\nDivision\n\nFinancial and \nFinancial and \nEconomic \nEconomic \nAnalysis \nAnalysis \nSpecialist\nSpecialist\n\nChief \nChief \nAccountant\nAccountant\n\nAccountant (3)\nAccountant (3)\n\nLawyer\nLawyer\n\nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n\ni\n\n7\n\n \n\n2\n7\n\n \n\n \n\n\f28  Appendix 7 \n \n\n \n\n3. \n\nFinancial Management Assessment \n\n \n \n9. \nA financial management assessment of MDF was undertaken using a questionnaire and \ninterview  approach.  It  focused  on  the  finance  and  internal  audit  departments.  Supplementary \nAppendix C provides a summary of the assessment together with the completed questionnaire \nand details of each member of the finance and internal audit staff, key qualifications, experience, \nresponsibilities, and supervising arrangements. \n \nThe  Finance  Department  of  MDF  is  well  run  with  qualified  and  experienced  financial \n10. \nspecialists  and  accountants;  staff  turnover  is  low.  The  department  is  headed  by  the  financial \nmanager who is assisted by four staff well versed in the procedures and reporting requirements \nof international funding agencies, including those of the European Bank for Reconstruction and \nDevelopment,  German  development  cooperation  through  KfW,  the  Millennium  Challenge \nGeorgia Fund, and the World Bank,. For example, for the MDDP II, the World Bank requires that \nannual  financial  statements  be  audited  each  fiscal  year  in  accordance  with  the  International \nStandards  on  Auditing  and  that  a  separate  audit  opinion  is  required  for  all.  For  the  MDDP  II, \nthese  comprise  (i)  a  summary  of  sources  and  uses  of  funds  showing  the  World  Bank  and \ncounterpart  funds,  including  contributions  in  kind,  separately  as  of  the  end  of  each  fiscal  year; \n(ii) a  summary  of  uses  of  funds  by  project  activities  (statement  of  expenditure  detail)  as  at  the \nend  of  each  fiscal  year;  (iii)  a  balance  sheet;  (iv)  a  statements  of  expenditures  withdrawal \nschedule for each fiscal year; and (v) a special account statement for each fiscal year. Annual \nfinancing statements for MDF comprise (i) a balance sheet as at the end of each fiscal period, \n(ii) an income statement for each fiscal year, (iii) a cash flow statement for each fiscal year, and \n(iv)  a  funds  flow  statement  for  each  fiscal  year.  MDF  has  no  difficulties  in  producing  these \nreports  on  time.  Each  one  of  the  funds  run  by  MDF  has  separate  accounts,  and  there  is  no \nmixing of funds. \n \n11. \nThe accounting system is computerized using an off-the-shelf software package from the \nRussian  Federation.  With  the  merger  of  the  GSIF  and  the  Irrigation  and  Drainage  Community \nDevelopment  Project  subprojects  with  MDF  in  2006,  there  were  three  different  accounting \npackages  in  use.3  Late  in  2006,  MDF  opted  for  one  package,  and  from  1  January  2007  all \ndepartments  have  been  using  the  latest  version  of  1C  Accounting.  Spreadsheet  reports,  using \ndata from the accounting system, however, are prepared for international agencies rather than \nbeing an output of the system. There is a written financial management manual that is regularly \nupdated, and MDF is currently updating it for 2009. Financial reports are prepared on time and \nare accurate; unconsolidated accounts for each project in 2008 were submitted to the auditor in \nmid-February 2009. \n \n12.  MDF uses commercial accrual-based accounting, has a standard chart of accounts, and \nreports according to the International Financial Reporting Standards. The accounts are audited \nannually  by  an  external  private  auditing  company,  and  for  the  past  3  years  there  have  been \nunqualified audit reports. Adequate safeguards are in place to protect the integrity of data. MDF \nhas  no  cash,  except  for  small  amounts  as  petty  cash.  All  transactions  are  undertaken \nelectronically through bank transfers. There is an internal audit service comprising the head and \na procurement auditor. Annual budgets are prepared on time and approved by the supervisory \nboard.  Monitoring  of  actual  expenditures  and  budgeted  allocations  is  undertaken  monthly  but \nbetter linkages are required between physical and financial targets. \n\n                                                 \n \n3 The  Municipal  Development  Fund  used  Oris,  the  Irrigation  and  Drainage  Community  Development  Project  used  a \n\nself-made system based on Cooper software, while the GSIF used an older version of 1C Accounting. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 7 \n\n29 \n\n1. \n\nMajor Programs \n\nPrograms, Loans, and Business Planning \n\n \n13.  MDF is a project implementation and disbursement agency for funds of foreign-assisted \nand  locally  funded  projects.  It  is  neither  a  commercial  bank  nor  a  development  bank,  has  no \ndeposits,  and  receives  all  of  its  funds  as  grants  from  the  central  Government.  It  has  no \noutstanding  debts.  Most  of  its  funds  are  passed  on  to  municipal  governments  as  grants, \nalthough it has provided some loans to creditworthy municipalities under the World Bank MDDP \nI and II projects.  \n \nD. \n \n \n \nThe objective of MDF is to support the strengthening of institutional and financial capacity \n14. \nof municipal governments by (i) investing financial resources in local infrastructure and services, \nand  (ii)  improving  on  a  sustainable  basis  primary  economic  and  social  services  for  local \ncommunities.  It  accomplishes  this  by  financing  local  infrastructure  investments  and  capacity-\ndevelopment  projects.  In  2004,  MDF  disbursed  loans  and  grants  of  about  GEL3.8  million;  in \n2005 this increased to GEL23.5 million, and in 2006 to GEL70.3 million but in 2007 it decreased \nto  GEL39  million.  MDF  estimates  that  GEL88.9  million  was  disbursed  in  2008  (MDF  is  still \nfinalizing 2008 accounts) and that GEL89.5 million will be disbursed. Funds have been sourced \nfrom  the  Millennium  Challenge  Cooperation,  the  World  Bank,  and  other  international  financial \nagencies. Since 2002, MDF has generated it own revenue from loan repayments by municipal \ngovernments and is now relending some of these funds. \n \nThe  first  major  project  of  MDF  was  the  World  Bank-funded  MDDP  I  that  involved  the \n15. \nfinancing  of  89  investment  projects.  The  MDDP  II  followed  and  provided  investments  and \nsupporting  technical  assistance  to  more  than  20  municipal  governments.  In  2005,  the  GSIF \nmerged with MDF, expanding MDF\u2019s activities into social infrastructure rehabilitation. Under the \nGSIF  I  and  II,  rehabilitation  works  of  $29.3  million  were  carried  out,  largely  for  education \nfacilities. Both projects involve World Bank and German development cooperation through KfW \nfinancing. \n \nSince  2005,  MDF  has  been  implementing  the  $60  million  Regional  Infrastructure \n16. \nDevelopment  Project  financed  by  the  Millennium  Challenge  Corporation.  This  includes \nrehabilitation  works  in  water  supply  and  reservoirs,  and  irrigation  system  improvements.  The \nRegional Infrastructure Development Project is scheduled for completion in 2010. MDF, with the \nMinistry  of  Education  and  the  Science  Ministry,  is  also  implementing  the  Education  System \nRealignment  and  Strengthening  Program  2,  financed  by  a  World  Bank  loan  of  $15  million. \nRecently, under the nonproject grant funded by the Government of Japan, $2 million equivalent \nwas allocated to MDF to finance the acquisition of equipment for basic infrastructure services by \nmunicipal  governments.  In  2006,  the  Irrigation  and  Drainage  Consumers  Organizations \nDevelopment Project was transferred to MDF. \n \n17.  MDF is currently negotiating with the World Bank for a further $10 million loan to finance \nthe  extension  of  the  MDDP  II.  The  arrangements  will  be  the  same,  where  the  World  Bank \nfinances  60%  of  the  project  cost,  and  MDF  and  municipal  governments  equally  finance  the \nbalance. The total project cost is estimated to be $16.7 million and of this 40% ($6.7 million) will \nbe released as loans to municipal governments. It is expected that this project will start in mid-\n2008 and will be implemented over 3 years.    \n \n \n\n \n\n\f30  Appendix 7 \n \n\n \n\n2. \n\nOperating Modality \n\n \n \n18. \nCapital  investments  of  MDF  follow  a  clearly  defined  project  cycle  that  matches  the \nrequirements  of  international  financing  agencies.  This  investment  project  cycle  comprises  the \nfollowing  steps:  (i)  preliminary  review  of  the  proposal  and  carrying  out  of  required  feasibility \nwork, (ii) approval by MDF of the proposed investments, (iii) preparation of a financial proposal \nand request for approval by the MDF supervisory board, (iv) procurement and implementation of \nthe Project, and (v) monitoring and evaluation. Project or financing agreements are entered into \nby  MDF  and  the  concerned  municipal  government;  once  a  loan  project  is  approved  and  final \ncosts are known, a formal loan agreement is signed. \n \n19.  MDF short-lists contractors or suppliers, requests bids, selects the winning contractor or \nsupplier, and approves and disburses progress payments. Municipal governments are involved \nthroughout  this  process  and  sign  off  on  all  contract  approvals  and  payments.  Participating \nmunicipal governments are required to pay their contribution to MDF before commencement of \nthe construction contract. Upon completion of each subproject, MDF turns over the assets to the \nconcerned municipal government for operations and maintenance and, where appropriate, sets \nup a loan account for repayment by the municipal government.  \n\n \n3. \n\nLending Operations \n\n \n20. \nTo  date,  MDF  has  provided  loan  to  18  municipal  governments,  and  the  outstanding \nbalances  at  31  May  2008  was  GEL27.9 million.3  Loans  are  not  secured  but  payments  are \nenforced  through  the  legal  system,  if  necessary.  Penalties  are  charged  for  late  payments  at \n0.06%  per  day  of  arrears  on  the  amount  due.4  Collection  rates  are  generally  high.  In  cases \nwhere municipalities fell into arrears, or refused to pay back the loan, MDF took action to ensure \nthe loan is paid back. \n \n\n4. \n\nBusiness Planning \n\n \n21.  MDF does  not have an approved corporate or business plan, but undertook a planning \nexercise in January 2008. The output of this workshop was submitted to ADB and is the basis of \na  business  plan  being  prepared  by  MDF.  The  plan  will  modify  the  long-term  vision  for  MDF, \ntargeting  a  more  financially  sustainable  entity.  Outline  strategies  will  be  refined  and  more \ncomprehensive  financial  projections  prepared.  Detailed  action  plans  for  the  first  3  years  of  the \nplan  period  will  be  included.  A  draft  of  the  business  plan  has  been  prepared  and  it  will  be \nsubmitted to ADB as soon as it is ready for circulation. \n \nE. \n \n\nFinancial Performance and Projections \n\n3. \n\nFinancial Performance \n\n22. \nThe latest available MDF financial statements are for the year 2007. The total assets of \nMDF  as  at  31  December  2007  were  GEL42.3  million,  decreasing  from  GEL44.5  million  at  the \nend of 2006 because of repayment of loans to municipalities. Loans to municipalities accounted \nfor 58% of assets (GEL24.6 million) at the end of 2007, a decrease from GEL28.3 million (64% \n                                                 \n \n3   MDF has not yet finalized 2008 accounts. \n4    Loans  are  due  from  the  25th  to  the  end  of  each  month.  Any  payment  received  during  this  period  is  considered \ncurrent. Payments after this date are considered in arrears and charged the daily penalty from the 25th to the actual \ndate that payment is received by MDF. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 7 \n\n31 \n\nof  total  assets)  at  the  end  of  2006.  MDF  has  no  outstanding  long-term  debts,  and  has  not \nborrowed.6 \n \n23. \nTotal  revenue  in  the  fiscal  year  of  2007  was  GEL5.0  million,  an  increase  over  the \nGEL4.6 million  for  2006.  Interest  income  is  the  biggest  source  of  revenue  and  it  amounted  to \nGEL4.6 million in 2007 against GEL4.5 million in 2006. When set against operating expenses of \nGEL1.2  million  in  2006  and  GEL1.8  million  in  2007,  there  was  a  net  profit  before  tax  of \nGEL3.2 million in 2007 and GEL3.4 million in 2006. This slight decrease in profit is the result of \nan increase in expenses, especially administration costs. \n \n24.  MDF has not prepared long-term financial projections, and the only forecasts of revenues \nand expenditures are made for the annual budget. Latest estimates for the 2008 budget indicate \ntotal expenditures of GEL88.9 million, of which 50% is for Millennium Challenge Corporation, the \nEuropean  Bank  for  Reconstruction  and  Development,  and  the  Irrigation  and  Drainage \nCommunity  Development  Project.  Funding  for  2008  is  largely  from  grants7  and  cofinancing \n(90.5%), but interest income and principal loan repayments are estimated to contribute 9.5% of \ntotal financing. The 2009 budget has been prepared.    \n\n \n2. \n\nProjected Financial Statements, 2008\u20132018 \n\n \nAs part of the MSDP 1, financial projections were prepared with the assistance of MDF. \n25. \nThe results are summarized in Table A7.1 and show that MDF has sufficient cash to support the \nrequired  contributions  to  the  Project  and  it  realizes  an  annual  net  profit  over  the  period. \nSensitivity tests involving different capital investment programs and varying the grant\u2013loan ratios \nfor municipal government projects show that it is essential for MDF to undertake more lending so \nthat  the  interest  earned  continues  to  grow.  Current  lending  programs  are  reaching  completion \nand new ones are needed. \n \nTo  project  MDF\u2019s  financial  statements  (balance  sheets  and  income  statements),  a \n26. \ncomputer  model  was  developed  and  tested.  Projections  were  made  from  2008  to  2018,  using \nbase  data  as  supplied  by  MDF  that  supplemented  the  closing  account  balances  as  at \n31 December 2007.8 Financial statements for 2008 were projected through the input of the latest \n2008 budget forecast as provided by the head of the Finance Division. \n \n27. \n \n\nThe following were the key assumptions used to project the financial statements: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n(iii) \n\nProperty,  plant,  and  equipment.  Future  investments  for  computers,  vehicles, \noffice equipment, and furniture were assumed to be GEL0.1 million in 2008 and \nbeyond but adjusted for inflation. \nInvestment program. Based on MDF\u2019s projections. \nSalaries  and  other  operating  expenses.  Increases  in  salaries  of  7%  were \nassumed  for  2009  to  account  for  the  changes  in  withholding  taxes  and  for  the \nnew staff to be hired for the ADB project. Thereafter, an annual rate of growth of \n3%  (half  the  inflation  rate)  was  assumed.  Other  operating  expenses  were \nassumed to increase at 5% per annum. \n\n                                                 \n \n6  To date, all proceeds of loans from international funding agencies have been released to MDF as grants and in local \n\n7  Including the proceeds of foreign loans to the Government of Georgia, but released to MDF as grants. \n8 Those recorded in the Municipal Development Fund of Georgia, Independent Auditor\u2019s Report, Financial Statements \n\nfor the year ended 31 December 2007, September 2008. \n\ncurrency. \n\n \n\n\f32  Appendix 7 \n \n\n \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n(vi) \n\nLoan  repayments  from  municipalities.  Although  MDF  generally  has  100% \ncollection rates, some slippage has been introduced in the model and a collection \nrate  of  95%  was  assumed.  New  loans  were  restricted  to  those  under  the  ADB \nproject, the proposed new World Bank loan, and the nonproject grant funded by \nthe  Government  of  Japan.  All  of  these  were  phased  according  to  the  likely \ndisbursement plans for the projects. \nInflation. An annual rate of 6% per annum from 2008 to 2018 was used. \nIncome tax. Calculated at 20% of net income for the year. \n\nConclusions \n\n \nF. \n \n28. \nPast  financial  statements  and  projections  show  that  MDF  has  adequate  funds  for  its \noperations. Since 2004, MDF\u2019s current assets are about 5 times current liabilities, and there has \nbeen an annual profit. Loans made by MDF to municipal governments are being repaid, mostly \non  time.  Annual  financial  statements  are  externally  audited  by  private  auditors  and  MDF  has \ndetailed operations manuals together with a comprehensive and updated financial management \nmanual.

The  participating  municipal  government  applying  for  the  financing  of  a  specific \ninvestment project submits a request to MDF for financing, together with a project summary, the \nform of which will be provided in the operations manual to be prepared by MDF.  \n \n3. \n \n\nStep 2. MDF reviews the financing request with a view to determining whether \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nthe proposed subproject is consistent with MDF financing principles; \nthe applying municipal government is eligible for funding under window 1 (loan\u2013\ngrant cofinancing combination) or window 2 (grant cofinancing combination); \nthe  applying  municipal  government  has  the  necessary  borrowing  capacity  if \nfunding is to be under window 1; \ndocumentation  available  for  the  subproject  is  sufficient  for  preparation  of  the \nsubproject summary report (SSR); \nthe  proposed  project  will  require  any \nresettlement;1 and \nthe  proposed  project  will  have  significant  adverse  environmental  impacts  or  be \nclassified  environmental  category  A  (determined  using  the  rapid  environmental \nassessment  checklists  in  the  Asian  Development  Bank  [ADB]  Environmental \nAssessment Guidelines (2003).  \n\nland  acquisition  and \n\ninvoluntary \n\n \n4. \nStep  3.  The  proposed  subproject  will  be  deemed  unsuitable  for  MDF  financing  if  it \nrequires  any  land  acquisition  and involuntary  resettlement.  If  the  project  is  deemed  unsuitable \nfor MDF financing, MDF notifies the municipal government of the rejection of the request. \n \n5. \nStep  4.  MDF  prepares  the  SSR  for  financing  window  2  subprojects  and  the  SSR \nprovides information on (i) a short description of the proposed subproject; (ii) an investment plan \n(amount  of  the  proposed  investment  and  structure);  (iii)  a  financing  plan  (subloan  amount, \nterms,  grant,  amount,  and  cofinancing  need);  (iv)  a  description  of  all  possible  benefits;  and \n(v) implementation arrangements. \n \nStep 5. For window 1 subprojects,2 MDF prepares the subproject appraisal report (SAR). \n6. \nIf  documentation  is  deemed  insufficient  to  prepare  the  SAR,  MDF  agrees  with  the  municipal \ngovernment  on  the  scope,  terms  of  reference,  implementation  conditions,  and  schedule  of \nrequired  feasibility,  design,  and  other  complementary  studies  and  assessments  required  for \nproject  appraisal.  The  SAR  provides  information  on  (i)  the  scope  of  the  subproject; \n(ii) investment  and  financing  plans;  (iii)  environmental  screening;  and  (iv)  environmental, \neconomic,  financial,  social,  and  other  benefits  and  risks.  To  provide  the  information,  the  SAR \nshould answer the following questions: \n \n\n                                                 \n \n1   ADB  defines  involuntary  resettlement  as  social  and  economic  impacts  that  are  permanent  or  temporary  and  are \ncaused by (i) acquisition of land and other fixed assets, (ii) change in the use of land, or (iii) restrictions imposed on \nland as a result of an ADB operation. \n2   Estimated to cost $2 million and more. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 9 \n\n37 \n\n(i) \n\nHave  the  possibilities  to  address  the  problem  in  different  ways  been  given \nadequate consideration and discussed with the population? \n\n(ii)  What has been the MDF experience with similar projects? \n(iii) \n\nIs the municipal government capable of providing the 20% contribution to project \nfinancing up front? \nIs the municipal government capable of making the loan repayments? \n\n(iv) \n(v)  Will  the  municipal  government  ensure  sustainable  operation  and  maintenance \n\nafter the proposed investment?  \n\n(vi)  Who are the beneficiaries of the project (in qualitative and quantitative terms)? \n(vii)  Has  an  environmental  assessment  been  carried  out  and,  if  necessary,  have \nadequate  impact  mitigation  measures  been  identified  and  incorporated  into  the \ndesign and cost of the project?  \n\n(viii)  Does the proposed project conflict with any other ADB safeguard policy? \n(ix) \n\nIs  the  technical  solution  proposed  adequate  and  does  it  comply  with  Georgian \nlaws and regulations? \nIs  the  proposed  project  part  of  a  larger  investment  program  for  the  same  area, \nand  if  so,  how  does  it  fit  into  that  program  for  technical  aspects,  costs,  and \nimplementation  schedule  and  how  will  the  other  elements  of  the  program  be \nfinanced? \nAre the preparatory studies (including final design studies and other documents) \nrequired for project execution of a quality and completeness sufficient to evaluate \nthe technical and financial feasibility of the project, and will allow its subsequent \nimplementation, or are complementary studies required? \nIs  the  technical  quality  of  the  documents  consistent  with  standard  engineering \npractices? \n\n(x) \n\n(xi) \n\n(xii) \n\n(xiii)  Are the cost estimates reliable and do they allow determination of the project cost \n\nwith a reasonable degree of certainty? \n\n(xiv)  Are the implementation time estimates realistic? \n(xv)  What  are  the  tangible  and  intangible  benefits  of  the  project?  Have  they  been \n\nadequately determined and evaluated? \n\n(xvi)  Was  the  economic  evaluation  methodology  that  has  been  used  appropriate? \nHow  have  the  costs  and  benefits  been  calculated?  Are  the  results  allowed  to \nmake valid judgment in line with ADB\u2019s guidelines on economic analysis?3 \n\nStep 6. If the SAR or the SSR is accepted by the MDF supervisory board, MDF sends it \n\n \n7. \nto ADB. \n \n8. \nStep  7.  MDF  prepares  an  investment  financing  agreement  and  forwards  it  to  the \nmunicipal government for review. The agreement for the subproject that requires the SAR will \nbe prepared upon ADB\u2019s no-objection to the SAR.

The  framework  covers  the  scope  of  economic  analysis,  quantifiable  benefits \nexpected  from  each  type  of  investment,  identifiable  externalities,  and  methodologies  for \nconducting the economic analysis.  \n \nB. \n \n3. \nThe rationale for government intervention results from desire to improve access for the \npoor  to  municipal  services.  There  is  significant  scope  to  improve  municipal  services  through \nfinancial  and  technical  support  to  rehabilitate  the  infrastructure,  and  develop  the  capacities  of \nthe  municipal  companies.  It  is  incumbent  upon  the  Government  to  attract  external  financial \nresources to complement its own limited resources in order to meet the priority demands of the \nsector. \n \nC. \n \nAny  subproject  with  a  cost  of  $2  million  or  more  requires  economic  analysis  which \n4. \nshould  be  conducted  by  MDF  in  conjunction  with  its  feasibility  study.  Smaller  subprojects \ncosting less than $2 million will be evaluated on the basis of cost-effectiveness. \n \nD. \n \n5. \nspecific category of subproject to be covered by the Project. \n \nWater  Supply.  The  major  benefits  that  can  be  considered  in  the  economic  analysis \n6. \ninclude  (i)  utilities\u2019  operation  and  maintenance  cost  savings,  (ii)  the  willingness-to-pay  or \nreduction in health costs caused by a reduction in waterborne diseases (whichever is higher) for \ncurrently connected customers, and (iii) the willingness to pay or avoided water collecting and \nstorage  costs  or  reduction  in  health  costs  resulting  from  a  reduction  in  waterborne  diseases \n(whichever is highest) for customers to be connected under the Project.  \n \n7. \nSolid  Waste  and  Wastewater.  The  solid  waste  and  wastewater  treatment  subproject \nwill reduce the pollution of ground and surface water bodies. As a result, public health benefits, \ni.e., the reduction of waterborne diseases, are expected. However, these benefits will accrue to \nthe  public  as  a  whole,  particularly  the  users  of  these  water  bodies,  rather  than  to  direct \n\nThe  major  benefits  and  required  cost\u2013benefit  analysis  are  outlined  below  for  each \n\nMajor Benefits and Cost\u2013Benefit Analysis \n\nScope of the Economic Analysis \n\n                                                 \n \n1   ADB. 1997.

Manila. \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 12 \n\n \n\n46  \n \n\nrecipients of services. Practical quantification of the benefits is difficult and costly. Therefore, no \nquantitative cost\u2013benefit analysis is required for this type of subprojects. The subprojects falling \ninto this category will be evaluated on the basis of cost-effectiveness. \n \nUrban  Road  and  Public  Transport. The major benefits that can be considered in the \n8. \neconomic  analysis  include  (i)  utilities\u2019  operation  and  maintenance  cost  savings,  (ii)  vehicle \noperating cost savings caused by improved road conditions and reduced detours, (iii) decreased \ntravel time resulting from reduced congestion and detours, and (iv) reductions in pollution and \nhazards. \n \nMethodologies \n\nE. \n \nThe methodologies adopted in subproject economic analysis should be in line with those \n9. \nstipulated  in  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  the  Economic  Analysis  of  Projects  (footnote  1),  including, \namong other things, (i) demand assessment and projection; (ii) distinguishing incremental and \nnon-incremental  demands;  (iii)  identification  and  quantification  of  costs  and  benefits;  and \n(iv) conversion  of  financial  costs  to  economic  costs.  Sensitivity  analysis  should  examine  the \nimpact of cost increase, benefits decrease, and completion delays on a subproject\u2019s economic \nviability.  \n \nF. \n \n10. \nTo  be  eligible  for  financing  under  the  Project,  for  a  subproject  that  requires  a  cost\u2013\nbenefit analysis, the economic internal rate of return should be at least 12%. For a subproject \nthat does not require a cost\u2013benefit analysis, the subproject should have been justified as the \nleast-cost solution to achieve the subproject objectives, based on cost-effectiveness.  \n \nG. \n\nReview  Procedure  and  Institutional  Capacity  of  the  Municipal  Development  Fund \nof Georgia \n\nCriteria \n\n \n11.  MDF will review the adequacy of the economic analysis included in the feasibility study \nreport  and  verify  (i)  the  assumptions  and  data  used  in  the  economic  analysis,  (ii)  the \nappropriateness of the methodologies adopted by the analysis, and (iii) the economic eligibility \nof the subproject to be financed by the Project. The results of the review will be presented in a \nboard  memo,  which  will  form  the  basis  for  the  supervisory  board  to  discuss  and  consider  the \nsubproject\u2019s eligibility for MDF financing. \n \n\n  \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 13  47 \n\nENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT AND REVIEW FRAMEWORK \n\nA. \n\nDescription of the Financial Intermediary \n\nThe  Municipal  Development  Fund  of  Georgia  (MDF),  as  the  executing  agency  and \n1. \nfinancial intermediary for the Project, is a legal entity of public law whose purpose is to mobilize \nfinancial  resources  from  donors\u2014including  international  and  domestic  financial  institutions, \ndevelopment  partner  agencies,  and  government  agencies\u2014for \nlocal \ninfrastructure  and  services.  MDF  was  established  by  a  presidential  decree  for  the  purpose  of \nmanaging  the  investment  component  of  the  World  Bank\u2019s  First  Municipal  Development  and \nDecentralization Project (MDDP I) and subsequently MDDP II and other development agency-\nfunded projects. \n \n2. \nIn carrying out its activities, MDF acts in accordance with the provisions of the Law on \nLegal  Entity  of  Public  Law  of  28  May  1999,  the  provisions  of  other  relevant  laws  of  Georgia, \norders and decrees of the president of Georgia, agreements of the Government of Georgia with \ninternational financial institutions, MDF\u2019s charter, and the instructions in its operations manual. \nMDF is financially autonomous.  \n \nB. \n\nDescription of the Proposed Project \n\ninvestments \n\nin \n\n3. \nThe Project comprises two components: (i) an investment projects financing facility, and \n(ii)  project  management  and  capacity  development.  The  output  of  the  first  component  is \nincreased  quality,  coverage,  and  reliability  of  water  supply,  waste  water,  solid  waste \nmanagement, urban transport, and roads. The outputs of the project management and capacity \ndevelopment  component  are  (i)  improved  capacity  of  municipal  governments  to  prepare  and \nappraise  feasibility,  engineering  design,  environmental,  social,  and  other  related  studies;  (ii) \nimproved  capacity  in  project  management  at  the  municipal  level;  (iii)  strengthened  corporate \nand  business  planning  processes  within  MDF;  and  (iv)  improved  capacity  of  MDF  for  studies \nand training.   \n \nC.  \n\nOverview of the Environmental Management System  \n\n1. \n\nAssessment of Capability of Environmental Management Officers and Staff \n\n4. \nPresently, MDF has one environmental specialist under the management monitoring and \nevaluation  division.  The  specialist  is  responsible  for  providing  technical  assistance  to  the \nborrowing  municipalities  and  supervising  environmental  assessment  for  all  the  investments \nfinanced  under  the  World  Bank\u2019s  MDDP  II  and  by  the  Millennium  Challenge  Corporation. \nApproval  and  implementation  of  the  Project  is  likely  to  impose  additional  strain  on  the  single \nspecialist\u2019s  capacity,  particularly  considering  that  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  procedures, \ndespite broad similarities with World Bank procedures, are new to Georgia and MDF. \n \n\n2. \n\nOverview of Financial Intermediary\u2019s Environmental Policy \n\n5. \nMDF  does  not  have  a  separate  environmental  policy.  However,  its  operation  has been \ngoverned by the environmental laws in Georgia and the World Bank\u2019s environmental safeguards \npolicy  for  investments  financed  under  MDDP  I  and  II,  and  the  safeguards  policies  of  other \ndevelopment agencies, including the Millennium Challenge Corporation.  \n \n\n \n\n\f48  Appendix 13 \n \n\n \n\n3. \n\nDescription of Environmental Performance Monitoring and Reporting \nSystem \n\nThere  are  three  distinct  stages  of  environmental  assessment  during  a  typical  MDF \n\n6. \nproject cycle: identification, appraisal, and implementation. \n \n7. \nPreliminary  Environmental  Assessment  at  Identification  Stage. The main objective \nof the preliminary environmental screening of projects proposed for MDF financing is to ensure \nthat  proposals  for  projects  with  potentially  adverse  effects  that  cannot  be  effectively  mitigated \nare excluded from financing. During this stage, the following steps will be taken by MDF: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nCarry  out  a  desk  environmental  assessment  using  available  documents  to \nidentify  the  proximity  of  the  project  impact  area  to  protected  areas,  resorts,  or \nother restricted or extremely sensitive zones. \nCollect  evidence  that  the  proposed  project  does  not  violate  environmental \nregulation. \nEvaluate  evidence  of  unavoidable  and  adverse  environmental  impacts  that \ncannot  be  mitigated,  and  explore  possible  design  alternatives  and  mitigation \nmeasures.  If  such  alternatives  and  effective  mitigation  measures  are  not \navailable or are deemed unfeasible at a reasonable cost within the limits set by \nthe  local  government\u2019s  borrowing  capacity,  declare  the  project  ineligible  and/or \ndirect local government to other possible financing sources. \n\n \n8. \nThe  results  of  the  environmental  screening  and  assessment  should  be  summarized \nusing  statements  such  as  \u201cno  significant  environmental  impacts  are  anticipated,\"  \u201cpossible \nadverse  environmental  impacts  can  be  effectively  mitigated,\"  \u201cproposed  subproject  violates \nexisting environmental regulations,\" or \u201cproject will lead to positive environmental impacts.\" The \nwritten  comments  of  the  evaluation  should  include  a  brief  description  of  the  affected \nenvironment,  potential  impacts,  and  recommendations  on  (i)  the  involvement  of  environmental \nconsultants;  (ii)  the  need  to  consider  alternative  technical,  siting,  and  other  solutions;  (iii)  the \nneed for specific prevention and mitigation measures; and (iv) the desired level of environmental \nassessment and public involvement at further stages. \n \n9. \nappraisal include \n \n\nEnvironmental  Assessment  at  Final  Appraisal  Stage.  The  tasks  of  MDF  during \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nthe  environmental  assessment \n\nvisiting the project site and carrying out field assessment, including participating \nin public hearings and consultations; \ncomparing  results  and  recommendations  of  the  preliminary  environmental \nassessment  with  the  final  project  documentation;  ascertaining  that  necessary \nenvironmental  permits  (including  land  use,  resources  use,  debris  disposal,  and \nsanitary inspection) and approvals are in place or can be obtained; \npreparing \nenvironmental management plan (EMP); \nconsulting and disclosing the relevant information on the project\u2019s environmental \nimpacts in a form and manner understandable to those being consulted; \nexamining  the  project  documentation  to  check  that  (a)  the  environmental \nassessment  was  performed  in  accordance  with  regulations  and  that  it  followed \nthe  recommendations  of  the  preliminary  environmental  assessment,  (b)  the \ndocumentation  includes  all  the  necessary  permits  and  approvals  required  at \nappraisal  stage,  (c)  appropriate  prevention  and  mitigation  measures  have  been \n\nincluding,  where  needed,  an \n\n  \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 13  49 \n\nplanned  and  necessary  resources  have  been  allocated,  and  (d)  the  project \ndocumentation  and  findings  of  the  final  site  visits  have  been  presented  to  the \npublic and the project does not draw public objections; and \n\n(vi)  making  recommendations  on  the  level  and  mechanisms  of  environmental \nmonitoring during construction and subsequent operations of the project facilities. \n\n \n10. \nImplementation of Environmental Management Plan. During project implementation, \nMDF  will  monitor  implementation  of  the  EMP,  as  well  as  the  mitigation  of  any  unexpected \nadverse  environmental  impacts.  In  the  case  of  a  major  change  in  project  scope,  MDF  will \nensure  that  the  environmental  assessment  is  triggered,  and  that  the  project  proponent \nundertakes  the  environmental  assessment  process. 1  MDF  will  prepare  the  semiannual \nmonitoring  report,  which  will  describe  the  EMP  implementation  and  results,  compliance  with \nADB  loan  covenants  and  applicable  government  environmental  laws  and  regulations,  and  the \noverall  performance  of  MDF\u2019s  environmental  management  system  and  any  needed \nimprovements. MDF will ensure that the EMP be included in bidding and contract documents for \nsubprojects. \n \nF. \n\nProposed Environmental Assessment and Review Procedures for Investments \n\n1. \n\nOverview of Type of Investments to be Assessed \n\n11. \nInvestment projects financed by MDF loans and grants from the project resources will be \nlimited exclusively to rehabilitation, reconstruction, and repair of existing basic municipal service \ninfrastructure and facilities, and replacement of equipment for services delivery. The main sector \ncoverage  for  the  proposed  project  will  be  water  supply  and  wastewater  treatment,  urban \ntransport,  solid  waste  management,  and  coal  gasification  and  district  heating.  While  the \ninvestments  in  general  will  potentially  bring  about  significant  environmental  benefits,  some  of \nthem  may  cause  adverse  environmental  impacts  during  project  implementation  and  operation. \nFor example, wastewater treatment helps improve water quality, which has a positive impact on \nhuman health, while improper disposal of sludge may cause environmental damage and harm \nhuman  health.  Similarly,  solid  waste  disposal  projects  can  have  beneficial  impacts  on  human \nhealth  and  living  conditions,  but  poorly  designed  and  implemented  landfill  sites  may  pollute \nunderground water. \n \n\n2. \n\nCountry Environmental Assessment and Review Procedures \n\nAt  present,  environmental  permit  procedures  are  set  out  in  two  laws\u2014the  laws  of \n12. \nEnvironmental  Impact  Permit  (2008)  and  Ecological  Expertise  (2008).  Until  2005,  the  two \nprincipal environmental laws in Georgia were the Law on Environmental Permits and the Law on \nState Ecological Expertise, both of which came into effect in 1997. The Law on Environmental \nPermits  regulated  procedures  for  issuing  permits,  and  covered  environmental  permits, \nenvironmental  impact  assessments  (EIAs),  and  public  information  and  participation  issues  in \ndecision-making  procedures.  In  accordance  with  the  law,  all  projects  were  divided  into  four \ncategories based on their size, importance, and potential impact on the environment. While all \ncategories of projects must undergo Law on State Ecological Expertise2 (Review) to be issued a \npermit,  the  requirements  of  the  environmental  permit  process  are  different  for  different \ncategories of projects. \n \n\n                                                 \n \n1  World Bank. 1998. Pollution Prevention and Abatement Handbook. Washington, DC. \n2  Implemented from 1 January 1 1997. \n\n \n\n\f50  Appendix 13 \n \n\n \n\nOn  24  June  2005,  the  Law  on  Licenses  and  Permits  was  adopted  by  Parliament.  The \n13. \nnew  law  regulates  legally  organized  activities  posing  certain  threats  to  human  life  and  health, \nand  addresses  specific  state  or  public  interests,  including  usage  of  state  resources.  It  also \nregulates activities requiring licenses or permits; determines types of licenses and permits; and \ndefines the procedures for issuing, revising, and canceling of licenses and permits. A new law \non environmental impact permit has replaced the 1997 Law on Environmental Permits. \n \n14. \nA  major  difference  between  new  and  old  procedures  is  that,  unlike  the  old  procedures \nthat classified projects into four categories, the new procedures have been simplified to include \nonly  two  categories,  i.e.,  those  activities  that  require  an  EIA  and  those  that  do  not.  There  are \n24 categories  of  activities\u2014including  construction  of  facilities  for  recycling  of  solid  domestic \nwastes  (e.g.,  incineration  plants)  and/or  landfill  sites,  wastewater  treatment  facilities  and \nsewerage pipes, and water supply facilities\u2014which are subject to the EIA procedures in order to \nbe  issued  an  environmental  permit,  while  none  of  the  others  require  an  EIA.  The  new \ngovernment  procedures  are  different  from  ADB  requirements,  which  categorize  projects  into \nthree  categories  (A,  B,  and  C,  see  para.  21).  Furthermore,  in  determining  environmental \nstandards  for  ADB-supported  projects,  ADB  follows  the  standards  and  approaches  laid  out  in \nthe  World  Bank\u2019s  Pollution  Prevention  and  Abatement  Handbook  (footnote  1).  However,  with \nproper  justification,  the  environmental  assessment  for  any  individual  project  may  recommend \nadoption of alternative emission levels and approaches to pollution prevention and abatement to \nbetter reflect national legislation and local conditions (footnote 1). \n \n15. \nUnder  the  current  procedures,  the  proponent  of  a  project  who  seeks  an  environmental \npermit is expected to conduct an environmental assessment and public consultations within the \ndesired  time  frame  and  according  to  the  required  procedure.  The  proponent  will  involve  the \nMinistry  of  Environment  Protection  and  Natural  Resources  in  the  process  of  conducting  the \nenvironmental  assessment.  Upon  completion  of  the  environmental  assessment,  the  proponent \nmay apply to the ministry for an environmental permit. The ministry will carry out state ecological \nexpertise  of  the  Project  (for  which  the  EIA  has  already  been  conducted)  and  issue  a  permit \nwithin 20 days.  \n \n\n3. \n\nSpecific Procedures to be Used for Investments Under the Project \n\n16. \nResponsibilities  and  Authorities.  MDF  as  the  Executing  Agency  of  the  Project  will \nbear the overall responsibility of ensuring full compliance of the Project with the environmental \nregulations  and  policies  of  Georgia  and  ADB.  This  includes  (i)  conducting  preliminary \nenvironmental assessment, including environmental categorization and screening; (ii) ensuring \nthe environmental assessment is conducted in a satisfactory manner during the appraisal stage; \nthe  environmental  permits  and  approvals  have  been  obtained;  and \n(iii)  ensuring  all \n(iv) conducting  monitoring  during  project \nfor \ncoordinating with ADB\u2019s Central and West Asia Department (CWRD) in applying and satisfying \nADB\u2019s environmental safeguard procedures. \n\nimplementation.  MDF  will  be  responsible \n\n17. \nThe  Ministry  of  Environment  and  its  regional  offices  will  be  responsible  for  issuing  the \nenvironmental permits or consents when all the conditions are met, and may participate in the \nenvironmental monitoring to be conducted by MDF during project implementation. MDF will be \nresponsible for (i) conducting the environmental categorization using ADB\u2019s rapid environmental \nassessment checklist, (ii) conducting the required environmental assessment, (iii) preparing the \nEMP  if  required,  (iv)  obtaining  all  the  necessary  environmental  permits  and  approvals,  and \n(v) monitoring  implementation  of  the  environmental  mitigation  measures  as  specified  in  the \nEMP.  The  main  responsibilities  of  CWRD  will  be  (i)  reviewing  and  clearing  environmental \n\n  \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 13  51 \n\nassessment reports for category A and category B subprojects deemed sensitive by ADB, and \n(ii) conducting review missions to monitor implementation of the EMP\u2014ADB reserves the right \nto  review  any  subproject  proposal  and  its  EIA  or  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE).  In \naddition,  CWRD  will  provide  technical  support  on  ADB  environmental  safeguards  policy  and \nprocedures.  \n \n18. \nEnvironmental  Criteria  for  Subproject  Selection.  The  Project  will  primarily  focus  on \ninvestments  with  no  significant  adverse  environmental  impacts.  However,  in  some exceptional \ncases  where  the  needs  for  financing  environmentally  sensitive  subprojects  (e.g.,  landfill  sites) \nare  well  justified,  such  subprojects  may  be  considered.  ADB  and  the  Government\u2019s \nenvironmental  assessment  and  management  procedures  will  be  strictly  followed,  and \nenvironmental risks will be minimized to an acceptable level as a result of a properly assessed \nand planned mitigation program. \n \n19. \nEnvironmental  Classification.  MDF  will  undertake  the  environmental  categorization \nprocess  of  the  investments  using  rapid  environmental  assessment  checklists  in  ADB\u2019s \nEnvironmental Assessment Guidelines (2003). The categories are described as follows: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nCategory  A.  Investments  with  potential  for  significant  adverse  environmental \nimpacts. An EIA is required to address significant impacts. \nCategory  B. Investments judged to have some adverse environmental impacts, \nbut of lesser degree or significance than those for category A projects. An IEE is \nrequired  to  determine  whether  significant  environmental  impacts  warranting  an \nEIA  are  likely.  If  an  EIA  is  not  needed,  the  IEE  is  regarded  as  the  final \nenvironmental assessment report. \nCategory  C.  Investments  unlikely  to  have  adverse  environmental  impacts.  No \nEIA or IEE is required, although environmental implications are still reviewed. \n\n \nPreparation  of  Initial  Environmental  Examinations.  For  category  B  subprojects,  an \n20. \nIEE  will  be  prepared  in  accordance  with  the  requirements  outlined  in  ADB\u2019s  Environmental \nAssessment Guidelines. The IEE should be undertaken as part of the feasibility study, and the \nenvironmental  assessment  team  should  work  closely  with  the  technical  planning  and  design \ngroup  to  ensure  that  environmental  considerations  are  integrated  into  the  project  design.  The \nIEE must decide whether significant environmental impacts warranting an EIA are likely. If the \nEIA is warranted, the IEE must provide a recommendation on the scope and terms of reference \nfor  the  EIA.  Where  no  further  EIA  is  recommended,  the  IEE  must  include  an  EMP  for  each \npredicted  impact,  and  this  will  outline  identified  mitigation  measures  with  (i)  cost  estimates, \n(ii) responsible parties for implementation, (iii) type of monitoring to be conducted, (iv) frequency \nand  location  of  the  monitoring,  and  (v)  responsible  parties  for  the  monitoring.  All  the  strategic \nalternatives  should  be  assessed  and  decisions  should  be  taken  at  the  feasibility  study  stage. \nFurther, the EIA should be focused on the preferred alternative(s). \n \n21. \nPreparation of Environmental Impact Assessments. For any category A investments \nincluded  for  project  financing,  an  EIA  will  be  conducted  in  accordance  with  the  requirements \noutlined in ADB\u2019s Environmental Assessment Guidelines. The EIA, which will generally have a \nbroader  and  more  detailed  scope  of  work  than  an  IEE,  should  be  undertaken  as  part  of  the \nfeasibility  and  detailed  design,  and  the  environmental  assessment  team  should  work  closely \nwith  the  technical  planning  and  design  group  to  ensure  that  environmental  considerations  are \nintegrated into the project design. The EIA must include an EMP for each predicted impact, and \nthis will outline identified mitigation measures with (i) cost estimates, (ii) responsible parties for \n\n \n\n\f52  Appendix 13 \n \n\n \n\nthe  proposed \n\ninvestments  and \n\nimplementation,  (iii)  type  of  monitoring  to  be  conducted,  (iv)  frequency  and  location  of  the \nmonitoring, and (v) responsible parties for the monitoring. \n \nRequirements for Public Consultation. For category A and B investments, MDF must \n22. \nlocal  nongovernment \nconsult  with  groups  affected  by \norganizations. The consultation should take place as early as possible in the project cycle so the \nviews  of  the  affected  people  can  be  taken  into  account  in  project  design  and  mitigation \nmeasures included. For category A investments, MDF will ensure that consultation takes place \nat least twice: once during the early stage of EIA fieldwork, and once when the draft EIA report \nis available. \n \n23. \nRequirements  for  Information  Disclosure.  Summary  EIA  reports  for  category  A \nsubprojects  and  summary  IEE  reports  for  category  B  sensitive  subprojects  are  required  to  be \nposted on MDF and ADB websites. ADB\u2019s 120-day rule  requires that the full EIA for a category \nA  subproject  or  the  full  IEE  for  a  category  B  sensitive  subproject  be  available  to  the  general \npublic at least 120 days before subproject approval.   \n \n24. \nReview  of  Environmental  Assessment  Reports.  MDF  will  submit  an  EIA  for \ncategory A  subprojects  or  IEE  for  category  B  sensitive  subprojects  to  CWRD  for  review  and \nclearance, and to the Ministry of Environment. \n \n25.  Monitoring  Environmental  Performance.  MDF,  the  borrowing  municipalities,  and  in \nsome  cases  the  Ministry  of  Environment,  can  conduct  the  environmental  monitoring  in \naccordance  with  the  plans  and  schedules  outlined  in  the  EMP.  The  monitoring  results  will  be \nincluded as part of the progress report and submitted to ADB on a semiannual basis. \n \n\n  \n\n\fAppendix 14 \n\n53 \n\nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY \n\nCountry/Project Title: Georgia: Municipal Services Development Project \u2013 Phase 2 \n\n \nLending/Financing \nModality: \n\n \n\n \n\nFinancial Intermediation \n\nDepartment/ \nDivision: \n \n\nCentral and West Asia Department/ \nUrban Services Division \n\n \n\nI. \n\nPOVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\nA.  Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \n \nPoverty reduction and economic development have been top priorities for the Government of Georgia for a number of years. \nSeveral  reforms  have  been  launched  for  the  achievement  of  the  Millennium  Development  Goals  (MDGs).  As  poverty \nreduction through economic growth was a key priority for the Government\u2019s reform program, social spending was increased \nby  5%  of  gross  domestic  product  from  2003  to  2005,  pension  and  wage  arrears  were  eliminated,  and  a  targeted  poverty \nbenefit  was  introduced  in  2006.  The  links  between  the  governance  and  growth  reform  agendas,  and  their  impact  on \nemployment and poverty reduction, suggest that Georgia\u2019s reform program is on the right track. Poverty is expected to decline \nas  the  economy\u2019s  capacity  to  generate  new  jobs  develops  and  a  well-targeted  and  fiscally  sustainable  social  safety  net  is \nimplemented.  Under  the  Poverty  Reduction  Support  Operation  III,  the  Government  expanded  the  coverage  of  the  targeted \npoverty  benefit  to  about  90,000  extremely  poor  households  and  will  expand  it  to  130,000  households  under  the  Poverty \nReduction Support Operation IV.  \n \nInadequate  municipal  infrastructure\u2014including  transport,  waste  management,  waste  water,  and  drinking  water\u2014is  a \ncontributing factor to the incidence of urban poverty in Georgia. Supporting participating municipal governments in providing \nand  improving  the  above  public  services,  could  significantly  improve  the  living  condition  and  economic  development  of \nmunicipal populations. The rehabilitation of water supply and sewerage services, and improved management of solid waste \nand concomitant public and environmental health improvements, will see benefits spread to the entire municipal population, \nincluding the poor and especially women for whom water supply and waste management are among the most critical needs. \nImproved  transport  will  enhance  public  safety  and  the  quality  of  the  urban  environment.  Investments  in  the  infrastructure \nsectors will create employment for poor people. \n \nGeorgia only became an Asian Development Bank (ADB) member country in February 2007. ADB has prepared the Georgia \ninterim operational strategy (2008\u20132009).a ADB and the  Government has identified two projects that  will constitute the core \nprogram for 2008\u20132009: the Municipal Services Development Project 1 and 2, and the Regional Roads Development Project.  \n  \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                  Targeting Classification: Targeted intervention (MDGs) \n1.  Key Issues  \n \nThe  high  unemployment  rate  of  13.3%  is  expected  to  rise  further  because  of  the  economic  downturn  and  a  significant \nincrease  in  the  number  of  internally  displaced  persons  in  the  wake  of  the  August  2008  conflict.  In  turn,  the  rise  in \nunemployment is expected to affect poverty incidence, which was 23.6% in 2007. \n \nPoor  people  tend  to  have  larger  households  and  less  access  to  essential  infrastructure  and  services,  including  electricity, \nwater  supply,  and  waste  water.  In  2004,  a  new  phase  of  social  policy  started  in  Georgia  that  was  characterized  by  the \ntransition from a universal social safety system to a poverty reduction system. On this basis, the Government established a \nsocial assistance and employment agency in 2006, with the main function of implementing a poverty reduction program. \n \nThe Government aims to reduce overall poverty incidence by strengthening the social assistance system, improving access of \nthe poor to affordable basic services, and raising net job creation rates. Sustained growth is to be pursued through adherence \nto  macroeconomic  prudence,  economic  diversification,  and  infrastructure  development.  The  national  objective  of  reducing \nextreme  poverty  is  likely  to  be  achieved  with  the  successful  reform  of  a  social  assistance  program  that  aims  to  reach  the \npoorest and most vulnerable segments of the population. The social sectors now account for about a third of public spending. \nHowever,  achieving  the  MDG  for  access  to  safe  drinking  water  is  likely  to  be  more  challenging  as  there  are  significant \ndifferences  in  access  to  infrastructure  services  between  rural  and  urban  areas,  and  between  poorer  and  more  developed \nregions of the country. \n \nWith respect to water supply and waste water, the 2004 study on the water supply and waste water sector by the World Bank \nand  the  Government  summarized  the  following:  (i)  water,  waste  water,  and  wastewater  conditions  in  most  cities  and  towns \nrange from poor to very poor; (ii) water supply to homes is unstable and in most cases the hours or supply are declining and \nmany households use multiple water sources to meet their daily water demand; (iii) wastewater treatment plans are not fully \noperational;  (iv)  public  health  risks  are  increasing  because  of  the  discharge  of  nontreated  wastewater  and  insufficient \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 14 \n\n54  \n \n \n\ntreatment of piped water; (v) water supply facilities are old and suffer from deferred maintenance and repair, except in a few \ncases in major cities funded mainly through the Municipal Development Fund of Georgia (MDF).  \n \n2.  Design Features \n \nInadequate urban infrastructure, including transport, is a significant contributing factor to urban poverty in Georgia. The benefit \nin addressing the urban  infrastructure of the proposed project for the  participating municipal  governments  will be  significant \nimprovements in living conditions (including crucial public health benefits) and significant poverty reduction through improved \nservice  provision,  and  stimulation  of  economic  development  by  encouraging  investment,  job  creation,  and  labor  mobility.  In \naddition, investment will bring faster and more comfortable transport for all sectors of the city population, and reduced traffic \ncongestion and air pollution. Finally, the project will target vulnerable communities such as elderly and poor people.  \n \n\nII. \n\nSOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\nA. Finding of Social Analysis \n \nThe main stakeholders in this Project will be MDF, participating municipal governments, the private sector, utilities companies, \nand communities. \n \nIn recent  years, insufficient investment has  been available from the central government  for rehabilitation of infrastructure or \nthe  adequate  provision  of  services.  Preexisting  mechanisms  and  systems  for  maintenance  and  service  provision  have \ncollapsed  or  are  no  longer  appropriate.  The  level  of  dependence  on  central  government  (by  local  governments  and \ncommunities) for the provision of all infrastructure and maintenance services is generally high. \n \nThe major challenges for the municipal governments are: (i) how to improve basic municipal infrastructure and services in a \nsustainable  way,  (ii)  how  to  build  the  internal  capacities  necessary  to  plan  and  implement  appropriate  infrastructure \ninterventions  and  develop  sustainable  service  provision,  and  (iii)  how  to  engage  local  communities  to  mobilize  their  own \nhuman  and  financial  resources  in  support  of  infrastructure  projects. The  third  challenge  will  require  changes  in  attitude  and \nbehaviors with regard to payment for and maintenance of the system after rehabilitation.  \n \n\nB. Consultation and Participation \n\n \n1.  Provide a summary of the consultation and participation process during the project preparation. \n \nThe  civil  society  sector  is  quite  active  in  poverty  eradication.  CSOs\u2019  activities  include  business  development  programs, \nemployment creation, health and sanitation education, public awareness, and good governance. Public awareness campaigns \nto  better  educate  customers  about  essential  infrastructure  services  could  lead  to  improved  collection  rates,  protection  of \nwatersheds,  and  conservation  of  natural  assets.  As  the  process  of  decentralization  continues,  more  administrative  and \nservice-delivery  responsibilities\u2014including  urban  transport,  solid  waste  management,  water  supply,  road  maintenance,  and \nstreet  lighting\u2014become  a  function  of  local  government.  Involving  communities  and  CSOs  is  important  to  (i)  ensure  that \nparticipating  municipal  governments  are  using  MDF  support  on  important  infrastructure  and  (ii)  improve  the  prospect  for \nsustainable implementation.  \n \nThe  main  stakeholders  in  this  project  will  be  MDF,  participating  municipal  governments,  private  sector  and/or  utilities \ncompanies, communities, and CSOs including community-based organizations. MDF and participating municipal governments \nwill  ensure  that  the  results  of  social  assessment  and  stakeholder  consultations  will  be  adequately  taken  into  account  in \ndetermining  investment  priorities,  making  related  financial  decisions,  and  implementing  investment  projects.  Participating \nmunicipal  governments  will  coordinate  investment  priorities  and  assessing  the  financial  effects  and  affordability  of  loan \nfinancing  for  improvement  of  infrastructure  and  services.  As  part  of  the  preparation  of  any  investments  under  this  project, \nMDF will (i) ensure that a social assessment is carried out in close cooperation with the participating municipal governments; \n(ii)  identify  potential  social  issues  associated  with  investment,  carry  out  adequate  public  and  municipal  government \nparticipation and consultation; and (iii) ensure that arrangements are made for carrying out appropriate levels of participation \nand consultation during project implementation.   \n  \n2.  What level of consultation and participation (C&P) is envisaged during the project implementation and monitoring?  \n\n  Information sharing       \n\n  Consultation      \n\n  Collaborative decision making     \n\n Empowerment \n\n \n3.  Was a C&P plan prepared? \nIf  a  C&P  plan  was  prepared,  describe  key  features  and  resources  provided  to  implement  the  plan  (including  budget, \nconsultant input, etc.). If no, explain why. Undertaken under MSDP 1 \n \n\n Yes    \n\n No  \n\n  \n\n\fAppendix 14 \n\n55 \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\nC.   Gender and Development \n\n \n1.  Key Issues. Georgian legislation declares the equality of men and women in regard to civil and political rights.  \n \nAlong gender lines, the labor market in Georgia is segmented. Women are mainly employed in the public sector (117 women \nper  100  men)  as  opposed  to  the  non-public  sector  (57  women  per  100  men).  Women  in  the  non-public  sector  are  mostly \nemployed  in  agriculture,  education,  health  care,  and  small  manufacturing,  which  have  been  most  negatively  affected  by \neconomic transition. Most women manage their households\u2014including water, sanitation, and solid waste\u2014and are the most \naffected by the inadequate nature of water supply and sanitation infrastructure. \n \nThe  Project  will  directly  and  indirectly  benefit  women  by  promoting  improved  infrastructure,  including  waste  management, \nsanitation, potable  water, roads, and urban transport. The primary concerns of  women need to be addressed in the Project \ndesign and will be part of the consultative process. Initial discussion with CSOs working on gender issues revealed support for \nthe  proposed  projects  since  they  are  perceived  as  necessary  improvements  in  the  urban  living  environment  and  critical  for \nreducing health hazards like waterborne diseases.      \n \n2.

MDF and participating \nmunicipal governments will ensure that \nthere is no differential payment \nbetween men and women for work of \nequal value, and no child labor will be \nemployed in the construction or \nmaintenance activities. \nThe provision of affordable services to \nthe majority of communities, and the \nneed to cover the cost of operation and \nmaintenance of urban services, will \nneed to be balanced and involve \nconsultation.
