The first loan, approved in 2015, focused on reforming policy and strengthening regulatory \ncapacity  in  Hebei  province.2  The  second  loan,  approved  in  2016,  targeted  better  access  to \nfinance, especially for small and medium sized-enterprises, to scale up investments in pollution-\nreduction projects in the region.3 This third project will complement the previous projects and will \ndirectly help remove barriers to deploying high technologies that could reduce air pollution from \nindustries, urban infrastructure, and agriculture.4 \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nThe  greater  BTH  region  is  one  of  the  most  important  economic  regions  in  the  PRC, \ngenerating about one-third of the country\u2019s gross domestic product. However, it also has a high \nconcentration  of  people  and  energy-intensive  and  highly  polluting  industries,  which  resulted  in \nwidespread air pollution.5 Cities in the greater BTH region consistently rank highest in the country \nfor  high  concentration  of  particulate  matter  less  than  2.5  micrometers  in  diameter  (PM2.5)  and \nother air pollutants that contribute to the high air quality index (AQI) level.6 High levels of PM2.5 \nare serious health risks and can lead to premature deaths. \n \n4. \nThe Government of the PRC recognizes the importance of managing air pollution. In 2013, \nit  launched  the  Comprehensive  Action  Plan  for  Air  Pollution  Prevention  and  Control  (CAAP), \n2013\u20132017, which introduced the PRC\u2019s most stringent measures to reduce air pollution.7 It set \nspecific emission-reduction targets on levels of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide, PM2.5, and volatile \norganic compounds nationally and for the BTH region. The government in its Thirteenth Five-Year \nPlan  (Thirteenth  plan)  further  requires  hundreds  of  cities  to  meet  good  or  excellent  air  quality \nstandards 80% of the time and has set a cap on total energy consumption.8 In support of CAAP \n\n                                                \n1  The  greater  Beijing\u2013Tianjin\u2013Hebei  region  refers  to  Beijing  and  Tianjin  municipalities;  Hebei,  Henan,  Liaoning, \n\nShandong, and Shanxi provinces; and Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. \n\n2  ADB. 2015.

AQI  considers  six  atmospheric \npollutants:  sulfur  dioxide,  nitrogen  oxide,  particulate  matter  less  than  10  micrometers  in  diameter,  PM2.5,  carbon \nmonoxide, and ozone. In the PRC, the AQI is categorized from 50 (excellent) to 500 (severe pollution). \n\n7  Government of the PRC. 2013.

Beijing. \n\n \n\n \n\n\fimplementation, ADB contributed, targeted, and coordinated financing of $800 million (footnotes \n2  and  3)  and  the  World  Bank  did  the  same  for  $1  billion.  Since  then,  air  pollution  and  PM2.5 \nconcentration levels across the BTH region have declined each year\u2014by 10.4% in 2014, 14.3% \nin 2015, and 7.8% in 2016\u2014reversing the trend of increasing air pollution in the pre-CAAP years. \nThe  number  of  days  with  good  AQI  has  also  improved  across  the  region,  demonstrating  the \neffectiveness of CAAP and its actions. \n \n5. \nDespite this initial improvement, the annual average PM2.5 concentration level across more \nthan 95% of the cities in the region is still above World Health Organization and national ambient \nair quality standards.9 In the first quarter of 2017, PM2.5 levels also rebounded in the region for the \nfirst  time  since  2013  in  tandem  with  high  economic  growth  rates.  Thus,  efforts  need  to  be \nintensified  and  supplemented  with  fundamental  changes  in  the  region\u2019s  energy  and  industry \nstructure  by  adopting  cleaner  production  methods  and  high  technology.  This  is  essential  to \ndecouple robust economic growth from rising air pollution.10 \n \n6. \nIn  response  to  CAAP,  industrial  enterprises  chose  to  invest  in  low-cost,  end-of-pipe \nmeasures instead of more advanced and cleaner technologies. The main reasons for these are \n(i) enterprises are currently prioritizing investments in end-of-pipe control measures which give \nimmediate  benefits  but  do  not  address  the  underlying  issues;  (ii) enterprises\u2019  preference  of \nfollowing  cheaper,  high-return  investments  in  capacity  expansion  and  diversification  instead  of \ncapital-intensive,  modest-return  investments  in  pollution  reduction;  (iii) limited  knowledge  of \nfinancially viable high-technology options; and (iv) absence of appropriate financing vehicles and \ninstruments to deal with associated risks. The PRC has made efforts to strengthen environmental \nmonitoring and enforcement through reform of the Environmental Protection Law. In November \n2016, it issued the Implementation Plan for the Licensing System to Control Pollutant Emission \nand announced the impending implementation of an environmental protection tax with effect from \n1 January 2018. These are in early stages of implementation, and complementary measures to \nsupport investments in pollution reduction will provide better outcomes. \n \n7. \nThe PRC\u2019s economic structure is gradually moving away from export-oriented industrial \ngrowth  to  consumption-based  growth  of  the  service  industry.  But  systematic  microeconomic \ntransformations in industries and infrastructure services are needed to enhance the environmental \noutcomes of this macroeconomic transformation. Meeting longer-term air quality standards can \nbe  achieved  only  if  major  polluting  sources  adopt  high  technologies  and  cleaner  production \npractices to meet stringent emission standards. In addition to stringent standards and a robust \nenforcement  system,  investments  in  air  pollution  reduction  must  be  cost-effective  to  business \nowners. The role of advanced or high technologies in such a paradigm is important because it \ncan improve process efficiency while reducing emissions.  \n \n8. \nAdvanced or high technologies must be combined with appropriate financing to overcome \nexisting  barriers  (para.  6).  In  industry  and  infrastructure  services,  high  technologies  can  be \ncombined  for  a  more  comprehensive  low-emission  solution  for  any  specific  application.  An \nenergy-efficient building retrofit, for example, could include rooftop solar energy, more efficient \nlighting, advanced thermal management systems for space heating and cooling, and an intelligent \ndigital control system that ensures that all these high technologies work in sync as a system. But \nto be successful in this strategy requires bringing together a high level of technical expertise on \n                                                \n9  A targeted PM2.5 reduction of 40% from 2013 levels will still be about 50 micrograms per cubic meter (\u00b5g/m3) or about \n50% higher than the national standard. The air quality standard for PM2.5 in the PRC (GB 3095-2012) is 35 \u00b5g/m3, \ncompared with 15 \u00b5g/m3 for the United States and Japan, and 10 \u00b5g/m3 for the World Health Organization. \n\n10 China Council for International Cooperation on Environment and Development. 2015.

Beijing. \n\n2 \n\n \n\n\fhigh  technologies,  appropriate  financing,  and  innovative  business  models.  Demonstrating  this \napproach  through  a  selected  portfolio  of  subprojects  distributed  across  various  industries  and \ninfrastructure  services  in  the  greater  BTH  region  can  reinforce  confidence  in  the  commercial \nviability of such an approach and stimulate further demand. \n \n9. \nThe  project  will  implement  the  strategy  described  in  para.  8  by  establishing  a  regional \nemission-reduction and pollution-control facility for the greater BTH region. The facility will support \ndeployment of high technologies in major emitting industries. It will be held at and controlled by \nthe China Energy Conservation and Environmental Protection Group (CECEP),11 which is highly \nregarded for its high level of technical expertise across key sectors. It also has a proven record \nof successfully managing similar investment funds. It will identify subprojects, match them with \nappropriate  business  models  for  deploying  high  technologies  at  scale,  and  provide  financing \nthrough  the  facility.  The  facility  will  have  a  fund-of-funds  structure  with  three  types  of \ncomplementary investment funds: a regional fund,12 provincial or municipal funds involving local \ngovernment  investors,13  and  technology-  or  industry-specific  funds  targeting  high-polluting \nsources.14 In addition, the facility is expected to invest about 10% of the facility amount directly \ninto some highly potent pollution-reducing subprojects. The figure provides an overall structure of \nthe facility. \n \n\nOverall Structure of the Facility \n\n \n\nADB  =  Asian  Development  Bank,  BTH  =  Beijing\u2013Tianjin\u2013Hebei,  CECEP  =  China  Energy  Conservation  and \nEnvironmental Protection Group, MOF = Ministry of Finance, PRC = People\u2019s Republic of China. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n\n                                                \n11 CECEP is the PRC\u2019s largest state-owned enterprise focused on energy conservation and environmental protection, \nwith total assets of CNY144 billion. Its main business is in the areas of energy efficiency, clean energy, environmental \nprotection, and recycling of resources. \n\n12 The facility is expected to provide up to CNY1.75 billion, and the People\u2019s Insurance Company of China has proposed \nto contribute at least CNY1.75 billion (with an option for a maximum CNY4.25 billion). This fund is mainly used to \nsupport CECEP-led projects in the greater BTH region. \n\n13 The  Jinan  municipal  government  is  expected  to  contribute  CNY500  million,  the  facility  expects  to  provide \nCNY500 million,  and  the  Industrial  Bank  Co.,  Ltd.  is  expected  to  contribute  CNY1  billion.  Discussion  with  other \nmunicipal governments is also ongoing, including with the Shenyang and Zhangjiakou municipalities. \n\n14 A  Deep-Well  Geothermal  Development  Fund  is  being  set  up  to  support  deep-well  geothermal  for  clean  heating \ntechnology. The Dezhou municipal government proposes to contribute CNY100 million, the facility is expected to \nprovide CNY150 million, and the Shanghai Pudong Development Bank is expected to contribute CNY750 million.  \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\nThe facility will provide debt and equity investments to eligible subprojects, but will limit \n10. \nthe  aggregate  amount  of  equity  investments.  All  equity  investments  will  be  protected  with  a \ncreditworthy put option15 against a third party or will have a viable exit strategy that will enable \nCECEP  to  recover  the  investment  in  a  timely  manner.16  Investee  companies  will  have  the \nfollowing necessary characteristics: (i) profitable, (ii) a professional management team, and (iii) \nclear routes of enhancing value. In the case of put-protected equity, the facility or the funds may \nsupport (i) special purpose vehicles for stand-alone equity investments to finance financially viable \nand  capital-intensive  subprojects  where  the  sponsor  lacks  sufficient  registered  capital  to  raise \nnecessary  debt  funding,  or  (ii)  enterprises  with  capital-intensive  investments  that  need  equity \nfinancing matching their risk profiles.17 \n \n11. \nThe facility will set up an energy service company (ESCO) fund to support energy-saving \nand emission-reduction subprojects in the iron and steel industry.18 ESCOs have been effective \nin driving energy-efficiency investments in other countries, and is a priority for the Government of \nthe PRC. But the region only has a limited number of ESCOs with the capacity to finance and \nimplement  complex  and  larger  industrial  energy-efficiency  projects.  An  Steel  Group  Energy \nSaving  Technology  Co.,  Ltd.,  which  is  expected  to  cofinance  this  fund  with  the  facility  and  a \ncommercial bank, is an ESCO under the An Steel Group.19 It is one of only two registered ESCOs \nrecognized by the National Development and Reform Commission and the Ministry of Finance in \nthe  iron  and  steel  industry.  An  Steel  ESCO  has  identified  for  potential  investments  more  than \n80 subprojects  in  the  iron  and  steel  industry.20  In  addition,  two  CECEP  \u201csuper  ESCOs\u201d  may \nreceive funding through the regional fund for further investment in qualified subprojects.21 \n \n12. \nThe project fully aligns with the priority of ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, 2016\u20132020 \nfor the PRC in support of the government\u2019s priority to realize ecological civilization.22 The project \nalso supports the priorities of ADB\u2019s Midterm Review of Strategy 2020 to mitigate climate change \nand promote environmental sustainability.23 Some key features of the proposed project are briefly \ndescribed in paras. 13\u201318. \n \nInnovative  use  of  financial  intermediation  loan  modality.  The  project  will  use  the \n13. \nfinancial intermediation loan modality, which is best suited to (i) extend the project\u2019s reach across \n\n                                                \n15 A put option is an option contract in which the beneficiary of the put option obtains the right to sell a specified quantity \n\nof a security at a specified price within a fixed period or on the occurrence of certain events. \n\n16 Equity investments without a put will be provided in limited cases to support the expansion of proven, financially and \neconomically  viable high  technologies  by companies  that cannot  meet  commercial  banks\u2019 collateral  or the  funds\u2019 \ndebt requirements. \n\n17 Most investments into the funds will be equity so that the funds themselves are not indebted. But the funds will be \nrequired to use facility\u2019s money primarily to invest as debt or as put-protected equity in subproject companies. The \nput provider must not have a poor credit record, as recorded in the People\u2019s Bank of China\u2019s credit history database. \nThe  creditworthiness  of  the  put  providers  needs  to  be  monitored  semiannually  by  CECEP,  and  in  case  their \ncreditworthiness drops, CECEP must inform ADB to take additional measures to mitigate the risks. \n\n18 The An Steel Group, one of the largest steel producers in PRC with a production capacity of 33.2 million tons, is \nexpected  to  contribute  CNY100  million  to  the  fund.  The  facility  will  contribute  CNY300  million  and  the  Shanghai \nPudong Development Bank is expected to contribute CNY1.2 billion. This is considered an industry-specific fund. \n19 An Steel Group Energy Saving Technology Services Co., Ltd. was formally established in 2010 with a registered \n\ncapital of CNY20 million, which gradually increased to CNY100 million. \n\n20 The iron and steel industry is a major polluting source. A high concentration of iron and steel plants exacerbates poor \n\nair quality in the region. \n\n21 A super ESCO is an entity normally established to facilitate large-scale implementation of energy-efficiency projects \n\nand support capacity building and project development activities of private ESCOs. \n\n22 ADB.  2016.

Considering  the  large  investment  needs  of  about  CNY1.8 \ntrillion, such leveraging is essential to maximize project impact. \n \nEnable high technology deployment across key sectors. The facility\u2019s focus is on high \n15. \ntechnologies across key polluting sectors. CECEP developed robust project selection criteria to \nensure that high technology remains a priority in selected subprojects. This is best illustrated in \nthe first batch of subprojects that have been pre-appraised (paras. 31\u201336). \n \nAchieve high co-benefits of climate change mitigation. Since fossil fuel burning is a \n16. \ncommon  source  of  air  pollution  and  carbon  dioxide  (CO2)  emissions  in  the  BTH  region,  all \nsubprojects supported by the facility will achieve significant CO2 mitigation. It is estimated that by \nthe closing of this loan, the facility will contribute 5 million tons of CO2 mitigation each year. \n \nImprove  sustainability  via  market-based  approach.  All  facility  investments  are  at \n17. \nmarket  prices  to  help  ensure  the  facility\u2019s  sustainability.  The  participation  of  a  wide  array  of \ncofinanciers will also help the cofinanciers gain better insights into the facility\u2019s operation and the \nmerits of investing in high technology for emission-reduction and pollution-control projects. This \nmay ensure their future interest in similar investments across the region and in the PRC. \n \nImprove corporate governance. CECEP is one of the largest state-owned enterprises \n18. \nin the PRC. The setup of this facility has brought in an international dimension and introduced \nmany good practices into the project design, especially in the financial, environmental, and social \nmanagement of the facility. In addition, a higher level of due diligence, cofinancier partnerships, \nand  investment  decision-making  practices  will  further  enhance  CECEP\u2019s  capacity  and \ngovernance across this facility\u2019s operation. Many of these good practices are anticipated to spill \nover to other parts of CECEP\u2019s governance and management. \n \nB. \n \n19. \nThe project is aligned with the following impact: air pollution reduced and public health in \nthe BTH region improved (consistent with CAAP and Thirteenth plan). The project will have the \nfollowing outcome: air pollution reduced and high technology deployed across the greater BTH \nregion.24 \n \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n                                                \n24 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\fOutputs \n\nC. \n \nOutput 1: Regional Emission-Reduction and Pollution-Control Facility established. \n20. \nBy  2023,  the  project  will  establish  a  facility  comprising  regional,  municipal,  or  provincial  and \ntechnology- or industry-specific funds totaling \u20ac428.0 million. \n \nOutput  2:  High  technologies  to  reduce  air  pollution  in  agriculture,  distributed \n21. \nenergy,  heating,  transport,  and  iron  and  steel  industry  deployed.  By  2023,  the facility  will \nprovide at least \u20ac1,721.2 million in financing for deploying high technologies to reduce emissions \nand  pollution.  This  output  will  cover  the  (i)  construction  of  three  biogas  and  organic  fertilizer \nproduction facilities, (ii) natural gas production from coke oven gas established at two coke oven \nfacilities, (iii) two smart micro-grids constructed in industrial parks, (iv) geothermal-based district \nheating provided to two million square meters of floor area, (v) completion of energy-efficiency \nmeasures  in  five  iron  and  steel  plants,  and  (vi)  hydrogen  fuel  cell  based  public  transport  pilot \ntested. \n \nOutput  3:  Capacity  of  key  stakeholders to  deploy  high  technologies  for  pollution \n22. \nreduction  in  the  greater  BTH  region  improved.  By  2023,  the  project  will  train  at  least \n200 individuals from five key stakeholders in high technologies, selection of appropriate business \nmodels, and investment decision-making. In addition, the project will prepare and disseminate a \nguideline on selecting, appraising, and implementing such projects in selected industries. \n \nD. \n \n23. \n(Table 1), including financial charges.25 \n \n24. \nThe  government  has  requested  a  loan  of  \u20ac428.0  million  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital \nresources to help finance the project. The loan will have a 15-year term, including a grace period \nof  10  years;26  an  annuity  repayment  at  the  10%  discount  rate  option;  an  annual  interest  rate \ndetermined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending \nfacility; a commitment charge of 0.15% per year; and such other terms and conditions set forth in \nthe draft loan and project agreements. Based on this, the average loan maturity is 12.95 years, \nand there is no maturity premium payable to ADB. ADB lending is expected to leverage \u20ac1,293.2 \nmillion  or  about  three  times  its  amount  through  commercial  financing,  local  government \ninvestments,  and  counterpart  contributions.  This  includes  estimated  ut  \u20ac642.0  million  from \ninstitutional  investors,  local  governments,  and  commercial  banks;  and  \u20ac651.2  million  from \nsubborrowers. \n \n25. \nThe  Ministry  of  Finance  will  onlend  the  ADB  loan  proceeds  to  CECEP  on  identical \nrepayment terms, tenors, and pricing terms of ADB\u2019s loan in euros. CECEP will bear the interest \nand  foreign  exchange  risk  of  the  ADB  loan.  Fund  flow,  implementation,  and  risk-sharing \narrangements are described in the project administration manual (PAM).27 The financing plan for \nthe anticipated first batch of subprojects is in Table 2. \n \n\nThe investment cost of the first batch of subprojects is estimated to be \u20ac1,747.0 million \n\nSummary Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n\n                                                \n25 An entrusted loan refers to the extension of credit by a bank as an agent of entrusted funds from the facility or fund. \n\nThe bank will administer the debt but assumes no credit risk. \n\n26 A longer grace period is essential to seek the rollover of ADB loan proceeds and larger impacts. \n27 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n6 \n\n \n\n\fTable 1: Indicative Investment Amounts for First Batch of Subprojects \n(\u20ac million) \n\n1.

CECEP Huayu has thee shareholders, with CECEP \nCapital, a second-tier subsidiary of CECEP, holding a controlling ownership interest of 55%. Integrity due diligence \nof  CECEP,  CECEP  Huayu,  and  Shanghai  Pudong  Development  Bank  has  been  undertaken  in  consultation  with \nADB\u2019s Office of Anticorruption and Integrity and Office of Cofinancing Operations. \n\n29 CECEP\u2019s subsidiaries are involved in industrial and building energy efficiency, solid waste treatment, solar and wind \nenergy,  soil  remediation  and  pollution  control,  and  organic  and  inorganic  waste  recycling.  CECEP  also  has  an \nextensive  network  of  internal  and  external  experts  in  these  sectors;  and  extensive  experience  in  planning, \nimplementing, and monitoring investments in them. \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\fCompany will assess and approve investments in the funds and individual subprojects through \nan investment committee. The investment review and approval process will include investment \nstructuring  to  mitigate  technical  and  financial  risks  and  appraisal  of  environmental  and  social \nimpact  and  risk  under  an  environmental  and  social  management  system  (ESMS).30  The \nManagement  Company\u2019s  due  diligence  will  consider  technical  merit,  credit  quality,  and \nenvironmental and social impacts based on the subproject selection criteria.31 \n \n28. \nthe PAM (footnote 27). \n \n\nThe implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 3 and described in detail in \n\nAspects \nImplementation period \nEstimated loan closing date \nManagement \n(i)  Oversight body \n(ii)  Executing agency \n(iii)  Financial intermediary \n\nand implementing agency \n\n(iv)  Implementation unit \n\nProcurement \n\nRetroactive financing and/or \nadvance contracting \n\nDisbursement \n\nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nArrangements \nMay 2018\u2013May 2023 \n30 November 2023 \n\nNDRC and MOF \nCECEP \nCECEP  will  bear  the  credit  risk  of  the  facility.  CECEP  will  establish  investment \ncommittees  for  the  facility  and  each fund.  ADB  will  require  CECEP  to  obtain  a no \nobjection from ADB for entrusted loans where the amount of ADB loan proceeds to \nbe invested is above the free limit of \u20ac80 million. CECEP and the facility will contract \nwith the entrusted bank to administer accounts and provide cofinancing. \nThe PMO established in CECEP Huayu will act as the main implementation unit and \nwill  have  about  20  full-time  staff.  CECEP  will  enter  into  a  strategic  cooperation \nframework agreement with China Environmental Resources Technology Co., Ltd. to \nprovide  expertise  on  environmental  assessment  and  monitoring.  CECEP  will  also \nestablish an experts\u2019 committee to support technical appraisal and monitoring. \nThe  investee  companies  will  use  commercial  practices  acceptable  to  ADB  for \nprocuring  goods  and  services  using  the  proceeds  of  the  subloans  and  equity \ninvestments. ADB has prepared a procurement manual to provide guidance on how \ncommercial practices can be adopted in a manner consistent with ADB\u2019s procurement \nprinciples. \nThe  executing  agency  may  sign  subloan  agreements  prior  to  the  loan  agreement \nsigning  with  ADB,  and  this  will  be  deemed  as  advance  contracting.  Retroactive \nfinancing may be provided to refinance loans made for a subproject or to finance any \nsubproject that was self-financed by its owners and started before the effective date, \nprovided  that  expenditures  being  financed  or  refinanced  were  incurred  not  earlier \nthan 12 months prior to the signing of the loan agreement, and that the subproject \nwas  vetted  under  CECEP\u2019s  environmental  and  social  management  system  and  is \nfully compliant. Total retroactive financing will not exceed 20% of the loan amount. \nThe loan proceeds will be disbursed following ADB's Loan Disbursement Handbook \n(2017, as amended from time to time) and detailed arrangements agreed between \nthe  government  and  ADB  and  described  in  the  project  administration  manual  as \nspecial disbursement guidelines.a \n\nADB = Asian Development Bank; CECEP = China Energy Conservation and Environmental Protection Group; CECEP \nHuayu = CECEP Huayu Fund Management Co., Ltd.; MOF = Ministry of Finance; NDRC = National Development and \nReform Commission; PMO = project management office. \na  Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n\n                                                \n30 Financial  Intermediary:  Environmental  and  Social  Management  System  Arrangement  (accessible  from  the  list  of \nlinked documents in Appendix 2). CECEP and CECEP Huayu will adopt and implement the ESMS for the facility and \nfor each fund following national policies and regulations and ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). CECEP will \nconduct environmental and social due diligence to confirm compliance with the ESMS and national environment, \nhealth, and safety law and regulations before a subproject is approved. \n\n31 The eligibility criteria for the financed subprojects are in Appendix 3 of the Project Administration Manual and the \n\nFinancial Intermediary: Environmental and Social Management System Arrangement (footnote 27 and 30). \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\fIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nTechnical \n\n \n29. \nThe PAM details the subproject selection criteria, covering applicable technical, financial, \neconomic, and environmental and social safeguard requirements. It also includes guidelines on \nthe  screening  and  appraisal  of  individual  transactions  (footnote  31).  ADB  requires  CECEP  to \nprepare  appraisal  reports  to  verify  compliance  with  the  selection  criteria  and  obtain  ADB\u2019s  no \nobjection  for  subprojects  using  debt  financing  that  (i)  are  financed  with  retroactive  financing, \n(ii) receive ADB financing exceeding the free limit of \u20ac80 million for entrusted loans, or (iii) require \nany equity investment to be undertaken. \n \nA. \n \nADB carried out a detailed appraisal of six representative potential subprojects with good \n30. \npotential  for  replication.32  The  cost  of  the  representative  subprojects  is  estimated  at \n\u20ac225.6 million. Another set of potential subprojects with total investment of \u20ac4 billion is currently \nbeing screened and appraised. Technical due diligence of representative subprojects verified (i) \nthe technical feasibility  and  appropriateness  of  the  proposed  technologies  to  maximize  energy \nsavings and pollution reductions and (ii) the estimated cost. The high technologies used in the \nrepresentative subprojects are briefly described in paras. 31\u201336. \n \nDeep-well geothermal district heating. The facility will support deployment of deep-well \n31. \ngeothermal technology to overcome barriers such as higher capital cost and weak capacity and \nunderstanding on drilling, geological condition, and perceived technical and financial risks. The \nfacility will support mature drilling technology for geothermal wells and use tailwater recharging \ntechnology  for  sustainable  heat  extraction  without  any  water  depletion.33  This  subproject  can \nprovide  continuous  heating,  and  even  cooling,  using  100%  renewable  energy  with  no  direct \nemissions. By demonstrating the technology and its financial viability at existing heating tariffs, \nthe subproject will help its wider deployment.  \n \nIndustrial  by-product  gas  use.  The  subproject  will  use  coke  oven  gas  to  produce \n32. \nliquefied natural gas (LNG) for use in transportation, instead of the current practice of using coke \noven gas to generate onsite electricity and steam or to produce urea or methanol, which produce \nhigh air pollution.34 In addition, LNG is a cost-competitive and less polluting fuel for heavy-duty \nand long-distance transportation compared to diesel. This subproject will improve the availability \nof LNG supply and encourage more truck owners to retrofit their trucks to use LNG as fuel.  \n \nHydrogen-based low-emission transport. The subproject will use surplus wind energy \n33. \nto produce hydrogen in sustainable transport applications via investments in hydrogen fuel cell \nbuses. This is an innovative renewable energy storage solution that will help reduce curtailment \nof renewable energy, mainly from wind farms. Using hydrogen as transport fuel to displace diesel \nis  one  of  the  best  applications  in  terms  of  reducing  the  public  health  hazards  posed  by  PM2.5 \nemissions from diesel combustion in the greater BTH region.  \n \n \n\n                                                \n32 The technical description of the representative sample subprojects is in the Introduction of Technologies Used for \n\nRepresentative Subprojects (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n33 Tailwater  recharging  technology  recharges  water  back  to  the  underground  reservoir  after  purification  to  avoid \n\nreservoir water depletion and environmental pollution. \n\n34 The  coke  oven  by-gas  utilization  is  a  high  policy  priority  in  the  greater  BTH  region.  The  ADB  loan  in  footnote  2 \n\nincluded this policy action for Hebei. \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\fAdvanced biogas and organic fertilizer. The subproject uses anaerobic fermentation \n34. \ntechnology  for  biogas  production.  The  produced  biogas  is  then  purified  and  compressed.  The \ncompressed biogas is sold to consumers to replace gasoline and diesel for transport in the filling \nstation. In the PRC, organic waste production from straw, livestock manure, and agricultural waste \nexceeds 3.5 billion tons per year. However, the lack of an appropriate business model has delayed \nthe scale-up of this technology. The special feature of this subproject is a well-designed business \nmodel that can solve the problems faced during the biogas industry development, such as low \neconomic performance and unsustainable feedstock supply. The organic fertilizer produced by \nthis subproject could improve soil and air quality in the long run. \n \nSmart  industrial  zone  development.  The  subproject  creates  a  micro-energy  grid \n35. \nnetwork consisting of a few sub-micro-energy grids, including incorporating a broad spectrum of \nclean  energy  (natural  gas  trigeneration,  rooftop  solar,  and  concentrated  solar  thermal \ntechnologies); energy storage technology; energy efficiency; and intelligent energy management \nsystems to improve energy use in a high-technology industrial zone. It also optimizes energy use \nby allowing for energy trading between the sub-grids and with the regional grid for bidirectional \npower trade.  \n \nSuper energy service company. The subproject comprises a package of investments in \n36. \nindustrial  waste  heat  recovery,  energy-efficiency  improvement,  and  emission-reductions.  The \nbusiness model presented is important in that the energy recovery-and-use process effectively \npays for the emission-reduction requirements processes, which would otherwise be unprofitable, \ni.e., the subproject will prove that pollution control can be financially self-sustaining. The PRC\u2019s \niron and steel industry has great energy-saving and emission-reduction potential. The subproject \nis replicable throughout the iron and steel industry in the PRC.  \n \nB. \n \nFinancial  due  diligence  confirmed  CECEP\u2019s  financial  viability.  CECEP  has  a  strong \n37. \nfinancial  standing  and  can  meet  financial  obligations  and  debt  service  payments  without \ndifficulty.35  The  integrity  due  diligence  on  CECEP  and  CECEP  Huayu  showed  no  negative \nfindings.  Subprojects,  subborrowers,  and  equity  investees  will  need  to  meet  economic  and \nfinancial viability criteria, as documented in the PAM. The financial assessment of the facility and \nthe funds demonstrated their sustainability under prudent loss assumptions.36  \n \n38. \nADB  calculated  the  financial  internal  rate  of  return  for  the  appraised  representative \nsubprojects, which is 7.9%\u201338.0% and is higher than the weighted average cost of capital. The \neconomic  internal  rate  of  return  of  the  appraised  subprojects  is  7.5%\u201344.0%.37  The  non-\nincremental  benefits  of  the  representative  subprojects  include  the  avoided  use  of  coal,  diesel, \npetroleum,  and  nitrogenous  fertilizer,  as  well  as  external  benefits  of  CO2  emissions  and  local \npollutant abatement.  Global environmental benefits from CO2 abatement are valued at the 2016 \nglobal social cost of carbon of $36.30 per ton of CO2, adjusted to 2017 price levels, and increased \nannually by 2%.. Local environmental benefits from pollutant emissions abatement are valued by \nestimating the cost of premature mortality (labor loss) associated with the pollutants.  \n \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n                                                \n35 Financial Management Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n36 Financial Analysis and Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n37  Based  on  ADB\u2019s  Guideline  for  the  Economic  analysis  of Projects,  projects  that  primarily  generate  environmental \nbenefits (such as pollution control, protection of ecosystem, flood control and control of deforestation), the minimum \nrequired EIRR can be lowered to 6%.  \n\n10 \n\n \n\n\fGovernance \n\nPoverty, Social, and Gender \n\nC. \n \nFinancial  management  assessment.  ADB  conducted  the  financial  management \n39. \nassessment  following  ADB\u2019s  Financial  Management  and  Analysis  of  Projects.38  The  result \nshowed that CECEP has adequate financial management systems and procedures in place to \nmeet ADB requirements. CECEP\u2019s 2012\u20132015 external audit reports had an unqualified opinion. \nThe financial management risk before mitigation is moderate (footnote 35). \n \nProcurement  risk  assessment.  Procurement  will  follow  ADB  Procurement  Guidelines \n40. \n(2015, as amended from time to time) applicable to financial intermediation loans, and appropriate \nprocedures will be adopted. ADB conducted procurement assessment on representative potential \nsubprojects.  It  showed  that  candidate  investees\u2019  procurement  practices  followed  established \ndomestic commercial practices, and procurement procedures aligned with PRC procurement laws \nacceptable  to  ADB.  Use  of  procurement  agencies  will  be  encouraged,  where    procurement \ncapacity  is  weak.  To  provide  guidance,  ADB  has  prepared  and  included  a  project-specific \nprocurement manual in Appendix 5 of the PAM. \n \nCorruption  prevention.  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was \n41. \nexplained to and discussed with the government and CECEP. The specific policy requirements \nand supplementary measures are described in the PAM. \n \nD. \n \n42. \nThe project will reduce air pollution and mitigate the negative social and economic impacts \nof local pollution. Improved air quality will directly benefit 371 million people, of whom 155.4 million \nare  women,  including  15 million  poor  people  in  the  BTH  region, of  whom  5.4 million  are  poor \nwomen. In addition, the project will indirectly create new employment. \n \nE. \n \nThe  project  is  classified  financial  intermediary  for  the  environment,  involuntary \n43. \nresettlement, and indigenous peoples.39 ADB conducted environmental and social due diligence \non  CECEP\u2019s  existing  portfolio  and  safeguard  policies,  institutional  capacity,  and  six  sample \nsubprojects.  ADB  and  CECEP  jointly  developed  an  ESMS  to  meet  national  laws  and  the \nrequirements of ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). The ESMS provides guidance on (i) \nscreening,  categorization,  and  review  of  subprojects;  (ii)  organizational  structure  and  staffing, \nincluding skills and competencies in environmental and social areas; (iii) capacity building; (iv) \ngrievance  redress;  and  (v)  monitoring  and  reporting.  Subprojects  classified  category  A  for  the \nenvironment and category A and category B for involuntary resettlement and indigenous peoples \nare  excluded from  ADB financing. The  ESMS  will  be  approved  by  ADB  and fully  implemented \nprior to first disbursement.  \n \nF. \n \nSignificant  risks  and  mitigation  measures  are  summarized  in  Table  4  and  described  in \n44. \ndetail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.40 The integrated project benefits and \nimpacts are expected to outweigh the costs. \n\nSummary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n\nSafeguards \n\n                                                \n38 ADB. 2005.

Initial  assessment  of  subprojects  presented  to  CECEP  and \nADB suggests that the investment pipeline will remain robust even in a \nmacroeconomic downturn. \nAchievement  of  air  pollution-control  objectives  in  the  BTH  area  will \nrequire  more  than  $30  billion  in  new  investments  in  the  immediate \nfuture. Based on the review of initial subproject proposals, demand for \nfinancing  is  strong  and  is  expected  to  increase  as  the  government \nmaintains regulatory pressure for air quality improvements. \nThe following measures were included in the project design: (i) limiting \nfinancing of such subprojects to the regional fund with participation by \nnon-CECEP-affiliated  investors  or  otherwise  with  ADB  approval,  and \n(ii) including mechanisms for review and approval or waiver of conflicts \nof  interest,  that  are  acceptable  to  ADB  and  approved  by  all  fund \ninvestors. \nEquity investment by the facility or the funds will only be allowed if (i) it \nis protected with a put option by a creditworthy third party or (ii) there is \nanother  viable  exit  strategy.  Every  equity  investment  requires  ADB\u2019s \nprior approval. ADB has set an aggregate limit for equity investments. \nCECEP  will  monitor  the  creditworthiness  of  the  put  provider  for  put-\nprotected equity, and actions will be taken if the creditworthiness drops. \nThe Management Company will get its new recruitment plan approved \nby CECEP and execute it in a timely manner.  \nThe  Management  Company  needs \nthe  market-based \ncompensation  incentive  policy  for  its  staff  approved  by  CECEP  and \nimplement it. \n\nto  get \n\nInsufficient fund management staffing. \n\nPoor investment performance. \n\nADB = Asian Development Bank, BTH = Beijing\u2013Tianjin\u2013Hebei, CECEP = China Energy Conservation and Environment \nProtection Group. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n \n45. \nThe government and CECEP have assured ADB that implementation of the project shall \nconform  to  all  applicable  ADB  policies,  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the PAM and loan documents. \n \n46. \nwhich are set forth in the draft loan agreement and project agreement. \n \n\nThe government and CECEP have agreed with ADB on certain covenants for the project, \n\nV. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n \n47. \nI am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  of \n\u20ac428,000,000 to the People\u2019s Republic of China for the Air Quality Improvement in the Greater \nBeijing\u2013Tianjin\u2013Hebei Region\u2014Regional Emission-Reduction and Pollution-Control Facility, from \nADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, in regular terms, with interest to be determined in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; for a term of 15 years, \nincluding a grace period of 10 years; and such other terms and conditions as are substantially in \naccordance with those set forth in the draft loan and project agreements presented to the Board. \n\n \nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n\n23 November 2017 \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 1 \n\n13 \n\nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n\nImpact the Project is Aligned with \nAir pollution reduced and public health in the BTH region improved (Comprehensive Action Plan for Air \nPollution Prevention and Control of the PRC and the Thirteenth Five-Year Plan)a \n\n \n\nPerformance Indicators with \nTargets and Baselines \n\nData Sources and \nReporting Mechanisms \n\nRisks \n\n \n \nMacroeconomic \nslowdown \nconstrains  ( i )  \ninvestments from \ncofinancing partners \nin the facility and \n(ii) private sector \ninvestments  in \nhigh-technology \nprojects with high \nperceived risk. \n\n \n \na.
