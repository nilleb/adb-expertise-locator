The \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  prepared  the  Dry  Zone  Urban  Water  and  Sanitation  Project \nunder  crisis  conditions  to  assist  the  government  in  providing  improved  water  and  sanitation \nservices in four major towns in northern and northwestern Sri Lanka.2 The project encountered a \nnumber  of  implementation  challenges  at  the  outset  but  has  since  advanced  significantly. \nDetailed  engineering  designs  have  been  completed  for  key  subprojects,  and  the  tendering \nprocess is moving forward rapidly. Project cost estimates have increased, leaving the financing \nplan with a shortfall of $50 million. An additional loan of $40 million is needed to help fund the \nproject  in  its  original  scale  and  scope,  ensure  that  its  development  outcomes  are  achieved, \nnarrow regional disparities, and support reconciliation in Sri Lanka. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\nA. \n \n3. \nThe  original  project.  On  28  November  2008,  ADB  approved  loans  and  grants \nequivalent to $113.33 million for the Dry Zone Urban Water and Sanitation Project.3 At the end \nof  the  conflict  in  2009,  the  project  became  a  critical  part  of  the  government\u2019s  investment \nprogram  to  modernize  and  expand  basic  infrastructure  and  public  services  in  affected  areas.4 \nThe  project  originally  supported  development  in  Sri  Lanka\u2019s  arid  and  conflict-affected  region, \nwhere  basic  services  such  as  drinking  water  supply  and  sanitation  are  inadequate  because \ncoverage  is  low  and  service  quality  substandard.5 Further,  water  resources  in  the  region  are \nscarce. 6  To  address  these  problems,  the  project  calls  for  rehabilitating,  expanding,  and \ndeveloping  water  and  sanitation  infrastructure  in  four  major  towns  in  the  north  and  northwest: \nChilaw, Mannar, Puttalam, and Vavuniya. The project supports (i) decentralizing service delivery \nfunctions  to  regional  offices;  (ii)  strengthening  water  resource  management,  coordination,  and \nplanning; (iii) building awareness; and (iv) strengthening the institutional capacity of the National \nWater Supply and Drainage Board (NWSDB), the project executing agency. \n \n                                                \n1  ADB.  2008.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors:  Proposed  Loan  and  Asian \nDevelopment  Fund  Grant  to  the  Democratic  Socialist  Republic  of  Sri  Lanka  for  the  Dry  Zone  Urban  Water  and \nSanitation Project. Manila (Loan 2477/G0129/130-SRI, $85 million, approved on 28 November). \n\n2   Annual rainfall in Sri Lanka\u2019s northern dry zone ranges from 1,200 to 1,900 millimeters but may be as low as 950 \n\nmillimeters, as in Mannar. Residents in project areas have been affected by 30 years of conflict and drought. \n\n3   The  project  includes  a  loan  for  $59.78  million  equivalent  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Fund  resources,  a  $23.22  million \n\nAsian Development Fund grant, and a $2 million grant from the Water Financing Partnership Facility. \n\n4   The government\u2019s investment program prioritized interventions in transport, energy, water supply, wastewater,  and \n\nirrigation and water resource management. \n\n5   The  project  preparatory  assessment  concluded  that coverage  ranged from  very  low  in  Vavuniya,  reaching 10%\u2013\n15%  of  the  population,  to  low,  reaching 50%\u201360%  in  Mannar,  Puttalam,  and  Chilaw.  Service  averaged  only  2\u20133 \nhours daily in Vavuniya and Mannar, 4\u20135 hours in Chilaw, and 6 hours in Puttalam. Sanitation in the area relies on \nseptic tanks and gray water discharge into stormwater drains. \n\n6   In all project towns, water is currently extracted from  the aquifer. The quality is generally poor,  and the aquifer is \nfragile, placing the long-term sustainability of supply is at risk. To meet current and future demand, surface water \nmust supplement groundwater sources. \n\n \n\n\fThe project was processed in a rapidly changing environment at the height of the conflict. \n4. \nThe  original  cost  estimates  were  based  on  feasibility  studies  prepared  under  challenging \nconditions  that  restricted  access  to  sites  and  left  population  patterns  uncertain.  Consequently, \nthe  project  was  structured  to  first  formulate  detailed  engineering  designs  for  individual \nsubprojects and then undertake construction and equipment installation. \n\n. \n\n5. \nProgress  in  implementation.  Despite  an  initial  setback  stemming  from  (i)  events \nassociated  with  conflict  cessation,7 (ii)  environmental  and  involuntary  resettlement  safeguards \nreclassified from category B to category A8 on account of Vavuniya\u2019s reservoir subproject,9 and \n(iii) other start-up delays,10 implementation has gained momentum since early 2012.  \n \n6. \nQualified technical staff are now deployed, detailed engineering designs completed, and \nbidding  documents  prepared.  Half  of  the  procurement  packages  (at  least  one  in  each  of  the \nproject  towns)  are  either  awarded  or  under  evaluation  of  tenders.  This  work  is  advanced,  and \ncumulative contract awards are expected to rapidly increase. However, contract award and the \nmobilization of contractors are now affected by the shortfall in the original financing plan. Output \ndelivery  is  also  advancing, 11 and  construction  is  progressing  effectively  and  undisrupted  as \nsafety  and  safeguards  aspects  were  carefully  considered  before  contract  award.  Satisfactory \nresettlement plans and initial environmental examinations have been completed and disclosed. \nA  draft  environmental  impact  assessment  for  Vavuniya\u2019s  reservoir  has  been  prepared  and \ndisclosed  for  consultation.  Many  risks  have  been  addressed  following  the  end  of  the  conflict, \nand  the  project  demonstrates  improved  project  readiness.  The  project  management  unit  has \nqualified  technical  staff,  and  its  procurement,  resettlement,  environmental  safeguard,  and \nimplementation capacity has been strengthened through training. The status of procurement is \nin Table 1 of the summary of project performance.12 Cumulative contract awards for the project \nare projected to double before the end first quarter 2013, setting the project on track. \n \n7. \nThe  cost  overrun.  Project  costs  are  $50  million  (44%  of  the  original  costs)  higher, \nbecause  of  price  increases  since  2008  and  cost  underestimation. 13 Some  physical  changes \nwithin  the  existing  scope  have  been  necessary  to  update  the  original  feasibility  assessment \nconducted under crisis conditions and enhance the quality of the infrastructure.14 \n                                                \n7   Critical  issues  adversely  affecting  project  readiness  in  the  months  following  conflict  cessation  included  (i) \nheightened security restrictions in Mannar and Vavuniya, (ii) changes to proposed sites after detailed topographical \ninvestigations  in  Chilaw  and  Puttalam,  (iii)  the  reluctance  of  NWSDB  personnel  to  work  in  regional  offices \nimmediately after the end of the conflict, and (iv) the need to demine Mannar.  \n\n8   Reclassification for involuntary resettlement was on 13 August 2012, and for environment was on 10 April 2012. \n9   Reclassification  resulted  from  the  return  and  resettlement  of  internally  displaced  people  after  the  conflict  and \nenvironmental reclassification by the Central Environmental Authority for Vavuniya\u2019s subproject on account of the \ndecision  to  classify  the  zone  where  the  reservoir  is  located  as  a  corridor  between  nature  reserves.  This  also \ndelayed construction and required mitigation that increased costs.  \n\n10  Delays  affected  loan  signing,  establishing  the  project  management  unit,  engaging  and  mobilizing  consultants, \ncompleting detailed designs, and receiving approval for land acquisition from local councils and private owners. \n11  For output 1, the selection of raw water sources and designs have been finalized, water rights obtained from the \nDepartment  of  Irrigation,  approval  for  all  water  treatment  and  septage  sites  received  from  urban  councils,  and \ndemining in Mannar completed. Detailed designs have been completed, and procurement for major civil works has \nsubstantially advanced since May 2012. Outputs 2 and 3, on institutional strengthening and capacity development, \nare substantially completed. Under output 2, socioeconomic surveys, water resource assessments, and river basin \nmanagement plans are completed. \n\n12 Summary of Project Performance (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n13  Cost  Estimate  Variation  Analysis  and  Cost  Overrun  Analysis  (accessible  from  the  list  of  linked  documents  in \n\nAppendix 2). \n\n14  Changes  include  (i)  increased  quantities,  material  specifications,  and  processing  estimates  following  detailed \ninvestigation  of  topographical  conditions;  (ii)  enhanced  rehabilitation  works  for  existing  water  treatment  plants  in \n\n2 \n\n \n\n\fImpact and Outcome \n\n \n8. \nRationale for additional financing. The project remains valid, sound, and strategically \nimportant to underpin welfare, poverty reduction, and reconciliation in the affected areas. This is \nwhy  the  Government  of  Sri  Lanka  requests  additional  financing  from  ADB,  the  net  benefit  of \nwhich  outweigh  those  of  other  options,  including  project  restructuring  and  downscaling. \nReducing  the  number  of  components  by  dropping  either  water  supply  or  sanitation  would \nprevent  the  project  from  achieving  its  intended  impact  of  improving  public  health  and  the \nenvironment  in  areas  severely  affected  by  long  conflict  and  drought.  Reducing  the  number  of \ntowns would forfeit investments made to date as losses. Additional financing complies with ADB \neligibility requirements.15    \n \n9. \nProject  risks  have  been  managed  and  mitigated.  Exogenous  risks  associated  with  the \nconflict during project preparation no longer apply, and corrective action such as demining and \nresettling  displaced  persons  has  been  done  or  is  advanced.  Remedial  measures  have  been \ndeveloped  to  address  implementation  issues,  such  as  (i)  deploying  qualified  staff,  (ii)  capacity \nstrengthening,  (iii)  appointing  a  standing  committee  to  expedite  procurement,  and  (iv)  costing \ndone based on detailed designs and current market prices. The project displays a high level of \nreadiness,  with  all  contracts  projected  for  award  by  mid-2013.  Postponing  processing  could \ncause further implementation delays and associated cost overruns. 16  \n \nB. \n \n10. \nThe project will improve the quality of life of residents in the north and northwestern dry \nzone  and  contribute  to  economic  activity  and  job  creation.  The  impact  of  the  project  will  be \nimproved  welfare  in  the  north  and  northwestern  dry  zone.  The  outcome  will  be  the  improved \ndelivery of urban water and sanitation services in Sri Lanka\u2019s northewestern dry zone towns.17  \n \nC. \n \n11. \nThe outputs are (i) urban water supply and sanitation infrastructure in four target towns; \n(ii) strengthened water institutions, including support to decentralize service delivery functions to \nregional  offices  to  strengthen  water  resource  management,  coordination,  and  planning  ability \nand  to  build  public  awareness;  and  (iii)  capacity  development  for  project  management  and \nimplementation. The outputs remain unchanged.  \n \n12. \nOutput 1 will finance infrastructure to abstract, treat, and distribute 61,500 cubic meters \nof water per day. It will support water resource development; the rehabilitation and construction \nof  new  treatment  facilities;  and  the  construction  of  storage,  transmission,  and  distribution \nsystems. The investments will maintain water supply in project towns, achieve adequate water \nquality  and  service  standards,  and  expand  coverage  to  underserved  areas.  It  will  finance \n                                                                                                                                                       \nChilaw and Puttalam, and treatment type of new plants; (iii) accounting for infilling for the distribution pipe network; \nand (iv) increased diameter of transmission and distribution pipes to satisfy future demand. \n\nOutputs \n\n15 ADB. 2011. Additional Financing. Operations Manual. OM H5/BP. Manila (para. 4). Under Additional Financing, a \nproject  is  eligible  for  additional  financing  if  it  remains  technically  feasible,  economically  viable,  and  financially \nsound;  the  government  has  accorded  it  highest  priority  (which  is  the  case  as  it  supports  regions  affected  by \nprolonged conflict); and it is consistent with project development objectives; ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for \nSri Lanka, 2012\u20132016, which supports development in lagging regions; and ADB\u2019s Water Operational Plan, 2011-\n2020. \n\n16  Footnote 21 of OM H5/BP qualifies well-performing ratings as the project having been rated on track for at least 12 \n\nmonths before cross-departmental circulation of the draft report and recommendation of the President.  \n\n17  The  revised  design  and  monitoring  framework  is  in  Appendix  1.

An environmental impact assessment has been prepared for Vavuniya\u2019s \nreservoir,  disclosed \nfor  consultation,  and  approved  by  Sri  Lanka\u2019s  Central \nEnvironmental  Authority.  Initial  environmental  examinations  for  all  other  subprojects \nhave  been  updated,  and  appropriate  mitigation  provisions  have  been  incorporated  in \nenvironmental  management  plans  and  contractual  documents.  NWSDB  has  recruited \nsocial  development  and  land  officers  and  engaged  nongovernment  organizations  to \nmonitor \nresettlement.

In Vavuniya and Puttalam, granular activated carbon filters will be added \nto the treatment process to remove algae. In Vavuniya, the average raw water supply of 6,700 \ncubic  meters  (m3)  per  day  will  be  supplemented  with  groundwater  from  Per  Aru  downstream \nareas  of  Ranimill,  Thandikulam.  In  Puttalam,  as  part  of  rehabilitating  the  existing  water \ntreatment  plant,  nanofiltration  or  reverse  osmosis  will  be  used  to  treat  groundwater  that  is \nexcessively hard and contaminated by manganese and iron. The diameter of the transmission \nmains will be increased from 450 millimeters to 560 millimeters to accommodate demand after \n2030. In Puttalam, the total length of water pipes laid will increase from 137 to 221 kilometers to \naccommodate infilling in the same distribution area. In Chilaw, the Bangadeniya water tower will \nbe  replaced  by  a  groundwater  reservoir  and  capacity  increased  from  750  m3  to  1,750  m3  to \nmeet operational requirements. Variable speed drive pumps will be used for water distribution. \nHigh-density  polyethylene  pipes  will  replace  ductile  iron  pipes  due  to  the  corrosive  nature  of \nsoils in Chilaw and Puttalam. NWSDB will introduce water safety plans to monitor water quality \nfrom intake to consumption points. \n\n \n\n22. \nSeptage treatment plants. Wastewater treatment processes have been revised. Sludge \nthickening tanks have been replaced by stabilization ponds as the latter are more cost effective \nand will simplify operation and maintenance (O&M) by urban councils. The capacity of septage \n\n \n\n\ftreatment  plants  will  be 30  m3/day,  which  is  adequate to  cover  septage requirements  in target \nareas. \n \n23. \nhave confirmed the population projections developed during project processing in 2008. \n \nB. \n\nPopulation coverage. Socioeconomic20 and census surveys21 conducted in 2010\u20132011 \n\nEconomic and Financial  \n\nEconomic  viability  and  sustainability.  Economic  analyses  have  been  redone. 22 \n24. \nQuantified water supply benefits are (i) resource cost savings from avoided treating and storage \nof  water  with  the  shift  to  piped  water,  (ii)  the  economic  value  of  incremental  water  consumed \nwith  increased  water  supply,  and  (iii)  the  value  of  time  saved  not  collecting  water.  Quantified \nsanitation  benefits  include  (i)  avoided  medical  costs  and  gains  in  productivity  from  reduced \nmorbidity rates, (ii) avoided cost of sewage disposal on site, and (iii) the value of compost that \nthe subproject is expected to generate. The estimated economic internal rates of return (EIRRs) \nof  individual  water  supply  schemes  range  from  13.2%  to  20.1%.  Septage  schemes  have \nindividual EIRRs ranging from 19.1% to 46.1%. Sensitivity analyses23 show the schemes most \nsensitive  to  increased  capital  costs,  but  their  EIRRs  remain  well  above  their  economic \nopportunity  cost  of  capital,24 except  if  the  Puttalam  water  scheme  has  higher  capital  costs, \nwhich is unlikely. The sustainability of the individual schemes is ensured with adequate funding \nfor their O&M. The proposed schemes will have the following social benefits: improved access \nto basic services, new employment opportunities, and lower poverty. The project is also justified \nin social benefit terms.25 \n \nFinancial  viability  and  sustainability.  Financial  viability  and  sustainability  have  been \n25. \nreevaluated. 26  Current  tariffs  were  used  in  the  analyses,  and  increases  were  projected  to \ndetermine financial viability. Assuming a tariff increase of 17.5% every 2 years uniformly applied \nto  the  water  supply  and  septage  schemes  in  the  four  towns,  yields  financial  internal  rates  of \nreturn (FIRRs) well above the weighted average cost of capital of 2.5%.27 The estimated FIRRs \nof the water supply schemes range from 2.6% to 6.6% and of septage schemes from 4.8% to \n5.8%.  Sensitivity  analyses  show  the  schemes  are  most  sensitive  to  lower  revenue,  but  their \nFIRRs  remain  well  above  the  weighted  average  cost  of  capital.28 Tariffs  are  affordable  to  low-\nincome households, at 3.8% of their monthly income. The schemes are financially sustainable \nwith  adequate  O&M  funding.  Financial  projections  of  individual  schemes  show  positive  net \nincome  and  cash  flows  each  year  over  the  forecast  period  after  the  schemes  become \noperational.29 \n                                                \n20 The  consultancy  for  package  C,  water  resource  management,  conducted  a  socioeconomic  assessment  in  2011. \n\nThe results were included in their draft final report. \n\n21 Government of Sri Lanka, Department of Census and Statistics. 2011.

Financial  Due  Diligence,  A  Methodology  Note. \nManila. \n\n27 NWSDB policy is to apply a uniform national tariff to all its water and sewerage schemes in Sri Lanka, and its most \nspecific  tariff  objective  is  to  recover  O&M,  debt service,  and  depreciation  for  all  water supply  systems  nationally. \nThe most recent tariff revision became effective on 1 October 2012. \n\n28 The scenarios were 10% higher capital costs and O&M costs and 10% less revenue. \n29 Financial Analysis: Revised (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\nC. \n\nGovernance \n\n26. \nPolicy and legal. NWSDB has, as a statutory entity under the Ministry of Water Supply \nand Drainage, a mandate to develop, operate, and control an efficient, coordinated water supply \nsystem and distribute water for public, domestic, and industrial use. The NWSDB Law No. 2 of \n1974 provides for NWSDB to levy charges for water it supplies.  \n \n27. \nInstitutional  capacity.  NWSDB  has  sufficient  capacity  and  institutional  strength, \nacquired  through  prior  experience  in  ADB-financed  projects,  to  implement  the  project.  To \nexpedite  resettlement  in  Vavuniya,  the  project  management  unit  has  engaged  resettlement \nspecialists  to  implement  resettlement  plans  in  line  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement \n(2009)  by  coordinating  with  government  agencies  and  affected  parties.  To  implement  the \nenvironmental  management  plan  (EMP),  the  project  management  unit  will  engage  an \nenvironmental  specialist  and  a  wildlife  conservation  specialist  and  thereby  ensure  compliance \nwith ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. NWSDB responsibilities and undertakings for financial \nmanagement,  procurement,  anticorruption,  and  project  management  remain  unchanged  from \nthe current project. \n \n28. \nProcurement  and  anticorruption.  Goods  and  works  are  procured  in  line  with  ADB\u2019s \nProcurement  Guidelines  (2010,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)  and  with  prior  review  by  ADB. \nNWSDB has established a website with information on fund use, bids, and contract awards. It \nwill  establish  a  database  for  defaulting  contractors  following  the  procedures  outlined  in  its \nnational procurement guidelines and ADB policies and procedures. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy \n(1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed with the government and NWSDB. \nSpecific policy requirements and supplementary measures are described in the PAM.  \n \nD. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\nThe project will deliver water and sanitation services to underserved areas; provide low-\n29. \ncost  sanitation  for  poor  communities  in  the  form  of  individual  household  latrines;  engage \nnongovernment  organizations  for  community  mobilization  and  building  public  awareness  of \nhealth,  hygiene,  and  sanitation;  and  establish  community-based  organizations  to  manage \ncommunal facilities.30  \n \n30. \nGender-inclusive design elements in the project include gender sensitization for NWSDB \nsenior management and project staff at the central and regional level, targeted gender training \nfor  project  staff,  the  collection  of  sex-disaggregated  data,  and  resettlement  that  addresses \ngender concerns. The updated summary poverty reduction and social strategy provides updates \non  post-conflict  conditions  in  the  project  area,  with  emphasis  on  the  social  and  gender \ndimensions of resettlement.31  \n \nE. \n \n31. \nSocial  safeguards.  The  original  project  was  category  B  for  involuntary  resettlement. \nFollowing the end of the conflict, the project was upgraded to category A because of significant \ninvoluntary resettlement required for the Vavuniya reservoir subproject. Three other subprojects, \n                                                \n30  Project  preparatory  surveys  showed  high  poverty  gap  ratios,  income  inequality,  low  education,  and  high \nunemployment.  Poverty  incidence  was  28.9%  in  Chilaw,  37.5%  in  Mannar,  39.7%  in  Puttalam,  and  24.4%  in \nVavuniya. Marginal improvements are thought to have occurred since 2010. \n\nSafeguards \n\n31  Summary  Poverty  Reduction  and  Social  Strategy:  Updated  (accessible  from  the  list  of  linked  documents  in \n\nAppendix 2). \n\n \n\n\fin  Chilaw,  Mannar  and  Puttalam,  have  minor  resettlement  impacts. 32  For  the  Vavuniya \nsubproject,  66  hectares  of  rice  land  and  25  hectares  of  highland  will  be  acquired.  Land \nacquisition  will  economically  displace  107  households.  Adequate  alternative  rice  land  and \nhighland will be distributed to affected people under the land-for-land compensation program, in \naddition  to  resettlement  assistance  provided  through  livelihood  training  programs.  The  project \nwill not have any impact on indigenous peoples. \n \n32. \nEnvironment.  The  project  was  reclassified  from  category  B  to  A  for  environment \nbecause  of  the  anticipated  significant  environmental  impacts  of  the  Vavuniya  subproject.  The \nreservoir inundation area has recently been designated part of a jungle corridor connecting two \nnature  reserves.  An  environmental  impact  assessment  was  prepared  for  Vavuniya\u2019s  reservoir \nsubproject  and  disclosed  for  consultation  on  13  July  2012.  The  assessment  concludes  that, \nalthough  two  plant  species  that  are  endangered  and  three  animal  species  that  are  critically \nendangered have been observed in the project impact area, potential harm to them is minimal \nand  can  be  mitigated  by  bringing  an  additional  area  with  similar  habitat  under  environmental \nconservation.  Site-specific  measures  outlined  in  the  assessment  and  biodiversity  reports  to \nensure the integrity of jungle corridors and the preservation of biodiversity are in the EMP. \n \n33. \nInitial environmental examination reports with EMPs, including environmental monitoring \nplans,  have  been  prepared  for  water  supply  and  septage  treatment  subprojects  in  Chilaw, \nPuttalam,  and  Mannar,  as  well  as  water  distribution  in  Vavuniya.  All  identified  and  envisaged \nenvironmental  impacts  can  be  managed  with  suitable  mitigation  measures  described  in  the \nEMPs.  Environmental  protection  measures  in  the  EMPs  will  be  incorporated  into  civil  works \ncontracts.33 The anticipated environmental impacts of the project are typical of civil works, such \nas  dust,  noise,  and  construction  waste;  temporarily  disrupted  traffic;  and  soil  erosion.  The \nproject  expects to use  existing  burrow  and quarry  sites.  If  any  new  burrow  or  quarry  sites are \nneeded, the project management unit will ensure that measures described in the EMPs are fully \nadopted  from  site  selection  to  closure,  and  that  required  approvals  are  obtained  from  the \nauthorities.  Local  communities  and  other  stakeholders  were  consulted  during  project \npreparation,  and  consultations  will  continue  throughout  implementation  as  required.  NWSDB \nand ADB will monitor contractors\u2019 environmental compliance with support from the supervision \nconsultant\u2019s team, which includes an environmental specialist. Any updates to EMPs, if required, \nwill be made by the consultant environment specialist and reviewed and approved by NWSDB \nand ADB. Semiannual environmental reports will be submitted to ADB for disclosure on the ADB \nwebsite in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement and  its Public Communications \nPolicy (2011).  \n \nF. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n34.  Major risks and mitigating measures are described in detail in the risk assessment and \nrisk  management  plan  (see  also  table  below).  The  end  of  the  conflict  in  2009  has  eliminated \nmajor implementation risks. Although a key risk to the Vavuniya subproject was associated with \nthe  provision  of  replacement  land to  compensate  people  economically  or  physically  displaced, \nthe government has prioritized the identification and approval of alternative land. The project\u2019s \noverall risk is assessed as medium without mitigation measures and low with mitigation.34  \n \n                                                \n32 Four  resettlement  plans,  one  for  each  project  town,  have  been  prepared  and  disclosed.  Land  acquisition  and \n\nresettlement plan implementation are under way. \n\n33 Training  and  coordination  workshops  will  be  organized  with  the  contractors  to  agree  modalities  for  implementing \n\nEMPs and necessary monitoring and reporting. \n\n34 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nRisks \n Government  delay  in  releasing \ncounterpart funds \nInsufficient information disclosure \nduring procurement \n\nMitigating Measures \nADB  will  closely  coordinate  and  review  progress  with  the  External \nResources Department during quarterly portfolio review meetings \nIn compliance with ADB Procurement Guidelines (2010, as amended \nfrom  time  to  time),  NWSDB  will  disclose  on  its  own  website \ninformation  pertaining  to  procurement,  including  advertising  for  new \nbids  and  contract  awards.

The government and \nNWSDB  agree  that  no  contract  shall  be  awarded  for  Vavuniya  water  supply  civil  works, \nconstruction  equipment,  or  materials  until  ADB  has  received  written  certification  from  the \nborrower that alternative land has been allocated for resettlement and compensation has been \npaid to all identified affected parties in accordance with the resettlement plan. The government \nand NWSDB have assured ADB that any future cost overruns for the project will be borne by the \ngovernment and NWSDB. \n \n\nV. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n37. \nI am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  in  various \ncurrencies  equivalent  to  SDR25,970,000  to  the  Democratic  Socialist  Republic  of  Sri  Lanka  for \nthe  additional  financing  for  the  Dry  Zone  Urban  Water  and  Sanitation  Project,  from  ADB\u2019s \nSpecial  Funds  resources,  with  an  interest  charge  at  the  rate  of  1.0%  per  annum  during  the \ngrace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter, for a term of 32 years, including a grace period of \n8 years; and such other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set \nforth in the draft loan and project agreements presented to the Board. \n\n \nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n\n \n26 November 2012 \n\n \n\n\fREVISED DESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n\n \n\n \n\nDesign \nSummary \n(Current \nProject) \nImpact \nImproved well- \nbeing of urban \npopulations in \nSri Lanka\u2019s \nnorthwestern \ndry zone towns \nof Chilaw, \nMannar, \nPuttalam, and \nVavuniya  \nOutcome \nImproved urban \nwater and \nsanitation \nservice delivery \nin Sri Lanka\u2019s \nnorthwestern \ndry zone towns \nof Chilaw, \nMannar, \nPuttalam, and \nVavuniya \n \n \n\nDesign \nSummary \n(Overall \nProject) \n\nImproved \nwelfare in the \nnorthern and \nnorthwestern \ndry zone \n\n \nImproved \nurban water \nand sanitation \nservice \ndelivery in Sri \nLanka\u2019s \nnorthern and \nnorthwestern \ndry zone \ntowns  \n \n \n \n\n \nSame \n\nOutputs \n1.
