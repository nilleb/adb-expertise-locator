The  report  also  describes  (i)  the \nproposed administration of a loan and a grant to be provided by the Strategic Climate Fund (SCF),1 \nand (ii) the proposed administration of technical assistance (TA) to be provided by the Republic of \nKorea  e-Asia  and  Knowledge  Partnership  Fund  for  Capacity  Development  in  the  Electric  Utility \nIndustry. If the Board approves the proposed loan, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by \nthe Board, approve the administration of the SCF loan, the SCF grant, and the TA. \n \n2. \nThe  project  will  support  the  expanded  deployment  of  solar  photovoltaic  power  plants  in \nCambodia and address the country\u2019s need to (i) expand low-cost power generation; (ii) diversify the \npower generation mix with an increase in the percentage of clean energy, in line with its greenhouse \ngas emission reduction targets2; and (iii) expand the use of competitive tenders and other global best \npractices in the energy sector. The project will support the national electricity utility, Electricite du \nCambodge (EDC), in constructing a 100-megawatt (MW) capacity solar power park (comprising civil \nworks, including access roads, fencing, and drainage systems) and a transmission interconnection \nsystem to the nearest grid substation.3 Through a transaction advisory services (TAS) agreement \nbetween the Office of Public\u2013Private Partnership (OPPP) of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and \nEDC, the project also aims to help EDC design and conduct a competitive tender for procuring an \nindependent power producer to build the first  solar power plant within the park.4 \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nSince 2010, the Government of Cambodia has made significant progress in developing the \ncountry\u2019s power network. The expansion of distribution networks to increase electrification rates and \nexpansion and diversification of national generation capacity beyond diesel plants have helped the \ngovernment lower power prices and meet high annual growth in demand that averaged 16% during \n2011\u20132017.  These  efforts  have  contributed  to  high  economic  growth  and  substantial  poverty \nreduction, but Cambodia\u2019s gross domestic product per capita, estimated at $1,427 in 2017, remains \namong  the  lowest  in  Southeast  Asia,  and  nearly  5  million  Cambodians  lack  access  to  electricity. \nContinued investment to expand the supply of electricity from sustainable and affordable sources \nwill improve Cambodia\u2019s economic competitiveness and the welfare of its people. \n \n4. \nEnergy sector status. At the end of 2017, Cambodia\u2019s installed capacity totalled 1,878 MW:  \nhydropower accounted for 980 MW (52%), coal-fired generation for 564 MW (30%), diesel for 295 \nMW (16%), biomass for 29 MW (less than 2%), and solar for 10 MW (less than 1%) (footnote 2). The \nhydropower  and  coal-fired  plants  are  owned  by  the  private  sector  and  operated  under  long-term \npower  purchase  agreements,  which  were  contracted  through  unsolicited  bids  with  take-or-pay \narrangements.  In  addition  to  domestic generation,  about  18%  of the  electricity  supply  is  imported \nfrom  Thailand  and  Viet  Nam.  In  2017,  82%  of  villages  and  69%  of  households  had  access  to \nelectricity. \n \n                                                 \n1   The SCF grant is funded through the Scaling Up Renewable Energy Program in Low-Income Countries. \n2   Electricity Authority of Cambodia. 2018. Report on the Power Sector of the Kingdom of Cambodia, 2018 Edition. Phnom \n\nPenh. \n\n2020. Manila. \n\n3   The project is included in Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2017. Country Operations Business Plan: Cambodia, 2018\u2013\n\n4   The solar power plants will be tendered to independent power producers in two phases. The first phase is 60 MW. The \n\nsecond phase will procure 40 MW, for a total of 100 MW. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f The  Power  Development  Plan5  (revised  in  2015)  projects  annual  electricity  demand  of \n5. \n18,000  gigawatt-hours  in  2030;  demand  was  8,073  gigawatt-hours  in  2017.  The  government \nforecasts meeting demand growth through further investment in thermal generation (coal-fired in the \nshort  term,  and  coal-  or  gas-fired  in  the  long  term)  and  large  hydropower.  Power  imports,  which \ncontributed significantly to meeting domestic demand since 2007, are being substantially reduced \nand replaced with domestic generation. Recent policies, however, have started a shift from coal and \nhydropower  development  to  more  sustainable  alternative  energy  sources,  particularly  solar.  The \ngovernment\u2019s Rectangular Strategy, Phase IV (2018\u20132023), highlights increased investment in solar \nenergy to reduce electricity costs and ensure long-term energy security.6 The government prioritized \nthe development of renewable energy in its National Strategic Development Plan 2014\u20132018 to meet \ngrowing  demand  for  electricity  in  Phnom  Penh  and  address  the  country\u2019s  electrification  target  of \n100% of villages by 2020.7 The government\u2019s Industrial Development Policy, 2015\u20132025 identifies \nCambodia\u2019s  historically  high  power  tariffs  as  a  major  impediment  to  the  competitiveness  of \nmanufacturing, and calls for the development of more affordable alternative energy sources.8 In its \nNationally Determined Contribution to the 2015 Paris Agreement, Cambodia committed to reducing \nenergy  sector  greenhouse  gas  emissions  by  16%  from  a  business-as-usual  scenario,  by  2030.9 \nClean alternative sources, such as solar energy,  would help reduce the cost of electricity supply; \ncomplement  installed  hydropower-based  generation,  which  is  often  inadequate  during  the  dry \nseason; and provide ancillary benefits to the grid around the key demand centers.10  \n \n6. \nTo alleviate the impact of high residential power tariffs, in 2015, the government introduced \na tariff subsidy scheme for poor and vulnerable households. Customers that consume less than 10 \nkilowatt-hours  (kWh)  per  month  are  currently  being  charged  about  $0.12/kWh  and  those  that \nconsume less than 50 kWh are being charged about $0.15/kWh. The current retail tariff for customers \nconsuming more than 50 kWh in and around Phnom Penh is $0.18\u2013$0.19/kWh.11 Lowering the cost \nof power has become a major government priority since the subsidy program began. At the same \ntime, the  price  of  imported  coal  has  increased, making  coal generation  less  advantageous,  while \nglobal  prices  for  renewable  technologies,  such  as  solar  photovoltaic,  are  rapidly  decreasing.  In \naddition, the development of coal and large hydropower plants is increasingly facing opposition from \nlocal  communities  and  civil  society.  In  2016,  the  government  announced  a  moratorium  on  the \nconstruction of large hydropower dams until 2020. \n \n7. \nIn  2013,  the  government,  with  support  from  development  partners,  began  to  seriously \nconsider solar energy generation. A technical study prepared that year by the Korea Photovoltaic \nIndustry Association for the Ministry of Trade, Industry, and Energy of the Republic of Korea and \nADB  helped  investigate  the  scope  for  developing  a  100  MW  solar  power  plant  in  Cambodia.12  In \n2015, a United States Agency for International Development-funded study explored the viability of \n                                                 \n5  Chugoku  Electric  Power  Co.,  Inc.  2015.

Other  related  development \npartner activities include expansion of the national grid (including grid strengthening for expanded \nrenewable energy generation), rural electrification, and capacity building.15 \n \nADB experience and strategic alignment. The government and ADB are developing new \n8. \nstrategic priorities for the country\u2019s energy sector. ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, 2014\u20132018 \nfor Cambodia,16 which was aligned with the Rectangular Strategy, Phase III (2013\u20132018)17 and the \nNational Strategic Development Plan, 2014\u20132018 (footnote 7), focused on two strategic pillars: (i) \nrural\u2013urban\u2013regional linkages and (ii) human and social development. In line with these priorities, \npast  investments  focused  on  expanding  access  to  the  grid  by  developing  transmission  and  sub-\ntransmission  lines  and  increasing  household  connections.18  The  Rectangular  Strategy,  Phase  IV \n(2018\u20132023) (footnote 6) promotes increased investment in renewable energy, particularly solar, to \nreduce  electricity  costs  and  improve  environmental  sustainability.  ADB\u2019s  Strategy  2030  similarly \npromotes  addressing  poverty  in  developing  member  countries,  tackling  climate  change,  and \nenhancing environmental sustainability.19 In line with these new strategies, ADB is supporting large-\nscale solar power generation in the country to improve the environmental sustainability of the energy \nsector, reduce electricity costs, and increase access to electricity, which can help drive economic \ndevelopment.20 In February 2016, the government\u2019s tender for a 10 MW solar plant at Bavet in Svay \nRieng Province resulted in a competitive tariff of $0.091/kWh, below EDC\u2019s average cost of supply \n($0.095/kWh  in  2015).  This  project,  which  is  financed  by  ADB\u2019s  Private  Sector  Operations \nDepartment, was commissioned in October 2017.21 Following the solar photovoltaic grid integration \nstudy, ADB completed a country-wide solar generation master plan for EDC (para. 7). An upcoming \nTA subproject will help the government develop a comprehensive energy sector strategy and power \ndevelopment plan.22 \n \n9. \nValue added by ADB assistance. ADB\u2019s experience with the Bavet project, a small project \nwith demonstrational effect (footnote 21), highlighted the importance of long-term international debt \nfinancing  and  standard  power  purchase  agreements,  as  prerequisites  for  low-cost  solar  projects. \nBuilding on this experience, the proposed project aims to demonstrate the ability of large-scale solar \nparks  to  further  lower  solar  energy  prices,  while  providing  technical  benefits  to  the  national  grid \n(footnote  10)  and  complementing  hydropower  generation.  The  project  will  be  the  first  large-scale \nsolar park in Southeast Asia and will draw on ADB\u2019s experience with the solar park model in India, \n\n                                                 \n13  R.  de  Ferranti  et  al.  2016.

Further, it will help EDC gain experience in procuring power from the \nprivate  sector  through  transparent  and  competitive  procurement,  using  standardized  legal  and \ncommercial agreements.  \n \n10. \nThe  project  represents  a  \u201cOne  ADB\u201d  approach  to  providing  end-to-end  support  to  EDC. \nSovereign  financing  will  be  provided  to  help  reduce  private  investment  risk  in  solar  generation \nprojects  in  Cambodia  by  building  the  solar  park24  and  transmission  infrastructure.  Ongoing  TAS \nprovided by OPPP is helping EDC design and conduct a competitive tender for procuring the first, \n60 MW, power plant to be built by the private sector within the park.25 The TAS includes project due \ndiligence, including legal, technical, financial, environmental, and social aspects; pre-feasibility and \nfeasibility  studies;26  and  support  for  the  development  of  tender  documents  and  long-term  power \npurchase agreements, the tender review, and the selection process. Finally, ADB, through its Private \nSector Operations  Department,  is  exploring the potential  of financing  the  development  of the first \nsolar plant in the park (footnote 25). Overall project scheduling is being managed, so that the solar \npark will be completed seven months in advance of the commissioning of the 60 MW solar power \nplant.  \n \nB. \n \nThe  project  is  aligned  with  the  following  impact:  cost  of  electricity  in  Cambodia  lowered \n11. \n(footnote 8). The project will have the following outcome: increase in private sector investments in \nsolar photovoltaic plants facilitated.27 \n \nC. \n \n12. \nOutput  1:  Solar  park  and  transmission  interconnection  constructed.  The  project  will \nsupport  EDC  in  constructing  a  100  MW  solar  power  park  in  Kampong  Chhnang  Province  and  a \ntransmission interconnection system to grid substation 6 (GS6) near the Phnom Penh demand center \nto supply power to the national grid. The park will consist of 100 hectares (ha) of land, and associated \nconstruction works (i.e., fencing, roads, and drainage systems), to accommodate 60 MW of solar \nphotovoltaic  plant  capacity.  The  transmission  interconnection  infrastructure  comprises  (i)  the  100 \nMW capacity pooling substation at the solar park, with two 50-megavolt-ampere transformers (and \nroom for two additional transformers); switchgear; an ancillary system; and controls; (ii) a supervisory \ncontrol  and  data  acquisition  system  compatible  with  EDC\u2019s  requirements,  advanced  forecasting \ntools, and expanded information and communication technology applications; (iii) a dedicated 40-\nkilometer 230-kilovolt double circuit overhead transmission line between the solar park substation \nand GS6; and (iv) two new bays with switchgear at GS6.28  \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nOutputs \n\n                                                 \n23  ADB.

Climate mitigation is estimated to cost $25.54 million, and ADB will finance \n25.34% of mitigation costs. Climate adaptation measures have been integrated in the main civil work \ncontract costs, and related costs are about $1.17 million. ADB will finance 100% of adaptation costs. \nDetails are in the PAM. \n \nE. \n \nEDC  will  be  the  executing  and  implementing  agency.  A  project  management  office \n17. \nestablished  in  EDC  will  have  overall  coordination  and  implementation  responsibility,  with  support \nfrom (i) a PIC for supervision of project implementation and management; and (ii) an engineering, \nprocurement, and construction contractor for the solar park civil works, substation, and transmission \nline. Procurement of the PIC and the contractor will be initiated as advanced action to achieve high \nproject  readiness.  Because  they  have  undertaken  several  ADB-financed  projects,  EDC  and  the \nproject management office have experience in and detailed understanding of ADB\u2019s procurement \nand  financial  management  policies  and  procedures.

The TA is estimated to cost $550,000, of which $500,000 will be financed on a grant basis \nby the Republic of Korea e-Asia and Knowledge Partnership Fund and administered by ADB. The \ngovernment  will  provide  counterpart support  in  the form  of  counterpart  staff,  office  and  workshop \nspace, office supplies, secretarial assistance, local communication facilities, domestic transportation, \nand other in-kind contributions. \n \n\nIV. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nTechnical \n\n \nA. \n \n19. \nThe  project  was  assessed  as  technically  viable  with  low  technical  risks.  The  transmission \ninterconnection  line  and  pooling  substation for  the  solar  park  will  use  standard  technologies,  and \nEDC  has  experience  developing  and  maintaining  similar  systems. The  system  design  has  been \nanalysed,  considering  the  assessed  solar  irradiation,  load  demand  curve,  grid  conditions,  and \nweather conditions. The substation will include remote monitoring and protection systems to stabilize \nthe grid in line with international design standards. Training will be provided by the PIC to EDC to \nsupport  the  sustainable  operation  and  maintenance  of  the  solar  park  and  transmission \ninterconnection.  EDC  will  also  benefit from the TA  subproject  by further strengthening  its skills  in \npower development planning and grid integration of renewable energy (footnote 22). The climate risk \nassessment does not anticipate significant climate risks over the design life of the park (25 years); \nhowever, site level, drainage provisions, and access road design will take account of potential flood \nrisks.33 \n \nB. \n \n20. \nEconomic due diligence assessed the project as a whole, including all components (i.e., land \nacquisition, construction of the solar park, and construction and operation of the 100 MW of solar \nphotovoltaic plants within the park). The project is economically viable with an economic internal rate \nof  return  of  20.0%,  which  exceeds  the  economic  hurdle  rate  of  9.0%.  Economic  benefits  are  all \nderived from the incremental output of the solar photovoltaic plants to meet additional demand; the \nbasis for the valuation of these benefits was the consumers\u2019 willingness to pay. A sensitivity analysis \ndemonstrates that the expected economic performance is robust. \n \n21. \nThe project is financially viable with a financial internal rate of return (FIRR) of 8.4%, which \nis higher than the 2.6% (real) weighted average cost of capital. A sensitivity analysis was conducted \nto account for potential variations in financial viability. The project is financially robust, as the FIRR \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n                                                 \n32  Attached Technical Assistance Report: Capacity Development in the Electric Utility Industry (accessible from the list of \n\nlinked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n33  Climate Change Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\nGovernance \n\nPoverty, Social, and Gender \n\nexceeded the weighted average cost of capital for all the sensitivity scenarios tested as follows: (i) a \n10% increase in capital costs, (ii) a 10% reduction in generation output of solar photovoltaic plant at \nP50 generation levels,34 (iii) a 10% increase in operation and maintenance costs, and (iv) a 1-year \nimplementation delay of the solar photovoltaic plant.  \n \nC. \n \n22. \nAn assessment of EDC\u2019s procurement capacity found a variety of risks, variously assessed \nas low to high in terms of potential severity, but with ADB support such risks are unlikely to affect the \nprocurement  process.  The  financial  management  assessment  followed  ADB  guidelines  for  the \nFinancial  Management  and  Analysis  of  Projects and  the  Financial  Due  Diligence:  A  Methodology \nNote.35 It identified no significant concerns regarding the capability of EDC to manage the project \nloans and grant in compliance with ADB requirements. The financial management assessment and \naction plan, as presented in the PAM, have identified required improvements, such as the need to \ncomplete the automation of accounting and financial information systems and to extend the scope \nof the internal auditing department to include externally financed projects. Therefore, EDC\u2019s overall \npre-mitigation  financial  management  risk  is  moderate.  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as \namended to date) was explained to and discussed with the government and EDC. The specific policy \nrequirements  and  supplementary  measures  are  described  in  the  PAM.  Integrity  due  diligence  on \nEDC followed ADB Operations Manual sections on anticorruption and on enhancing ADB\u2019s role in \ncombating money laundering and the financing of terrorism.36 No potential significant integrity issues \nwere identified with or relevant to the proposed project to be implemented by EDC. \n \nD. \n \nThe  project  is  expected  to  contribute  to  poverty  reduction  by  improving  essential \n23. \ninfrastructure and providing clean and reliable energy. It will supply energy to economic and industrial \nzones  in  the  neighboring  provinces  that  employ  or  directly  support  more  than  3,000  workers  and \nsupport other direct and indirect local business opportunities. Clean energy will also avoid emissions \nfrom thermal power plants and the associated health impacts, which can disproportionately affect \nthe poor and vulnerable. The project is classified general intervention and some gender elements at \nentry. While it does not address poverty directly, the project is expected to indirectly improve well-\nbeing and expand opportunities for livelihoods of the poor. The project design includes measures to \naddress poverty, including engaging low-income households and poor women for construction work. \nThe  project  will  comply  with  applicable  national  labor  laws  and  core  labor  standards,  including \nensuring equal pay for equal work regardless of gender, race, or ethnicity; and prohibiting child labor. \nIt  will  also  include  the  provision  of  special  assistance  to  households  headed  by  women  with \ndependents  for  any  loss  of  livelihood  or  income,  ensure  that  women  represent  at  least  40%  of \nparticipants  during  public  consultations  about  the  project,  and  ensure  the  EDC  capacity  building \ngender target is met. \n \nE. \n \n24. \ncategories are as follows.37 \n                                                 \n34  Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n35  Financial Management Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2); ADB. 2005.

Safeguard Categories. \n \n\n \n\n\f \nEnvironment (category B). EDC has prepared an initial environmental examination (IEE) \n25. \nand  an  environmental  management  plan (EMP),  covering  environmental  impacts  and  risks  in  the \nproject area of influence, including the solar photovoltaic plants, which are associated facilities; and \nGS6, which is an existing facility.38 The draft IEE has been disclosed on the ADB website, and the \nfinal IEE will be disclosed following the detailed engineering design. EDC will prepare a project brief \nin the local language, which will be made available at field offices. Public consultations have been \ninitiated to inform the project design and environmental assessment process and will continue during \nproject implementation. The PIC will provide support to EDC for EMP implementation and monitoring. \nEnvironmental complaints or grievances will be handled through a grievance redress mechanism. \nThe  solar  park  site  and  transmission  line  right-of-way  (ROW)  consist  of  shrubland,  rice  paddies, \norchards,  and plantations,  with the  ROW crossing  a few  small  water  bodies.  No  protected  areas, \nsignificant migratory bird species and flyways, or other particularly sensitive environmental receptors \nhave been identified in the project area of influence. The identified impacts are site-specific and can \nbe reduced to an acceptable level through mitigation measures. Adverse environmental impacts will \nprimarily  occur  during  construction,  such  as  vegetation  clearance,  some  earthworks  and  site \nlevelling, dust, noise, vibration, disposal of construction spoils, occupational and community health \nand safety hazards, increased traffic, and disruption due to power outages (e.g., when constructing \ntowers and stringing conductors). The EMP (i) includes mitigation measures during construction and \noperation,  including  developing  construction  management  plans;  and  (ii)  identifies  responsible \nparties and an implementation and monitoring budget. These measures and plans will be included \nin  project  bid  documents.39  A  climate  change  assessment  was  conducted  and  considered  in  the \nproject design, siting, and construction (footnote 33). \n \n26. \nInvoluntary  resettlement  (category  B).  Based  on  preliminary  assessments  and \nconsultations,  the  project  is  not  expected  to  have  significant  land  acquisition  impacts.  Physical \nrelocation of persons or loss of income are not expected. The project is expected to require about \n220 ha of land, of which 100 ha is required for the solar park, including land for the first 60 MW plant. \nEDC  is  procuring  land  for  the  solar  park  through  negotiated  settlement.  A  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement framework has been prepared to guide EDC in case negotiation fails and involuntary \nland  acquisition  is  required.  The  transmission  tower  footings  along  a  40-kilometer-long  ROW  are \nexpected to require 3 ha of land, and the 30-meter-wide ROW would require an additional 117 ha. \nThe  land  for  the  ROW  will  not  be  acquired.  EDC  has  prepared  a  draft  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement  plan  (LARP)  for  the  transmission  line  component  to  mitigate  impacts,  including \ncompensation at full replacement cost and allowances for the tower footings and the ROW. The land \nacquisition  and  resettlement  framework  and  the  draft  LARP  have  been  formulated  following \ngovernment laws and regulations and ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement, and have been disclosed \non ADB\u2019s website. The project is not expected to acquire any land from customary landowners. No \nlong-term  impacts  are  expected  as  the  construction  and  operation  will  not  restrict  the  community \nfrom accessing and using nearby resources. EDC's Social, Environment and Public Relation Office \nhas sufficient staff and capacity to plan and implement the LARP. In total, 226 persons (151 men \nand 75 women) participated in the public consultation meetings. Additionally, 86 women and 66 men \nparticipated in sex-disaggregated focus group discussions arranged at villages. EDC will continue \nconsultations with affected communities throughout the project cycle and use its grievance redress \nmechanism to receive, record, and facilitate the resolution of any concerns. The draft LARP for the \ntransmission line component will be updated and finalized following the detailed engineering design, \nsubmitted to ADB for review, and implemented before civil works begin. \n \n\n                                                 \n38  Initial Environmental Examination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n39  Relevant environmental and social safeguards provisions will also be included in the bid documents, including the power \n\npurchase agreement for the associated facilities (i.e., solar photovoltaic plants). \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n27. \nIndigenous  peoples  (category  C).
