An  environmental \nimpact  assessment  was \nundertaken.  The  summary  was  circulated  to  the  Board  on \n13 March 2007 and made public through the Asian Development \nBank (ADB) website on 14 March 2007. \n \nthe  Central  Asian  Regional \nin \nThe  countries  participating \nEconomic Cooperation (CAREC) program are working together to \nimprove  the  region\u2019s  transport  infrastructure  and  reduce  the  cost \nof  trade  across  regions.  The  Project  is  located  in  the  Xinjiang \nUygur Autonomous Region (Xinjiang), in the northwestern corner \nof the PRC. The Urumqi\u2013Kashgar road in Xinjiang is part of a key \nCAREC  transport  corridor  connecting  Xinjiang  with  Kazakhstan, \nthe  Kyrgyz  Republic,  Mongolia,  Tajikistan,  and  Pakistan.  It  also \nforms part of the Asian Highway 4 (AH-4) corridor designated by \nthe United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and \nthe  Pacific.  The  Korla\u2013Kuqa  section  is  part  of  the  Urumqi\u2013\nKashgar  road,  which  is  becoming  heavily  trafficked.  The  Project \nwill  upgrade  the  296.5 kilometer  (km)  Korla\u2013Kuqa  section  of  the \nexisting two-lane, class II national highway (G314) to a four-lane, \naccess-controlled tolled expressway to enhance the flow of goods \nand  passengers  through  the  region  and  reduce  travel  times  and \ncosts.  The  Project  also  includes  (i)  the  improvement  of  three \npriority local roads totaling 193 km in Kuqa and Qiemo counties to \nclass  III  or  IV,  as  these  provide  access  to  remote  and  poorer \nareas  of  Xinjiang;  (ii) improved  efficiency  in  freight  terminals  by \nintroducing  a  web-based  transport  logistics  system  in  freight \nterminals in Urumqi; (iii) improved rural transport services by pilot \ntesting of bus route licensing reforms in Kuqa county through the \nprovision of consulting services; (iv) improved road safety through \n(a) conducting a safety audit for the project roads, (b) developing \nan  action  plan  to  ensure  the  safe  operation  of  the  expressway, \n(c) installing modern traffic safety devices along the project roads, \n(d) increasing public awareness through training, and (e) providing \na  traffic  surveillance  monitoring  system  for  ensuring  road  safety \nthe  project \nduring  winter  and \nexpressway;  and \nthe  Xinjiang \nCommunications  Department  (XCD)  through  the  provision  of \nconsulting services, equipment, and training. \n \n\n(v)  enhanced  capacity  of \n\nfor  controlling  speeds  on \n\nBorrower \n \nClassification \n\n \nEnvironment \nAssessment \n\n \nProject Description \n\n \n\n \n\n\fii \n\nRationale \n\n \nImpact and Outcome \n\nProject Investment Plan \n\nFinancing Plan \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nto \n\nthe \n\ntrade \n\nseeks \n\nstrategy \n\nimprove \n\nfacilitation, \n\nThe CAREC Transport and Trade Facilitation Strategy will support \nthe  CAREC  goal  of  accelerating  economic  growth  and  poverty \nreduction by upgrading key transport corridors across the CAREC \nregion.  The \nregion\u2019s \ncompetitiveness and expand trade among the CAREC economies \nand  with  the  rest  of  the  world.  Key  elements  of  the  strategy  are \ncoordinated improvements to transport infrastructure and logistics, \nand \nincluding  harmonized  cross-border \nregulations, procedures, and standards along six priority transport \ncorridors.  The  proposed  Project  will  support  this  strategy.  The \nKorla\u2013Kuqa  expressway  will  serve  as  an  important  transport \ncorridor  ensuring  efficient  and  safe  movement  of  goods  and \npassengers,  and  will  play  a  critical  role  in  furthering  trade  and \nregional  cooperation.  The  Project  will \nfoster  economic \ndevelopment and promote interregional trade, thereby supporting \nthe  key  objective  of  poverty  reduction  through  sustainable \ndevelopment. \n \nThe  Project  supports \nthe  Government\u2019s  Western  Region \nDevelopment Plan and National Expressway Development Plan of \nbuilding  expressways  to  provide  stronger  links  with  the  eastern \nprovinces  and  improve  accessibility  for  the  western  region\u2019s \npopulation,  which  is  spread  over  a  large  area.  The  project \nexpressway is part of one of eight major road corridors under the \nWestern  Region  Development  Plan  and  one  of  34  expressways \nunder  the  National  Expressway  Development  Plan.  The  Project \nalso  supports \nthe  Rural  Roads  Construction  Program  and \nprovides  financing  for  the  upgrade  of  selected  rural  roads  in  the \npoorest  and  remotest  areas  of  Xinjiang.  The  Korla\u2013Kuqa \nexpressway  will  be  connected  to  these  local  roads  via  recently \ncompleted  highways,  and  will  also  serve  as  the  main  access  for \ntourists visiting the historical sites in the project area.  \n \nThe  impact  of  the  Project  is  to  develop  a  more  efficient  national \nand  regional \ntransport  system  which  supports  sustainable \neconomic  growth  in  Xinjiang.  The  outcome  of  the  Project  is  to \nimprove transport capacity and safety of the regional road corridor \nand the local roads in southern Xinjiang.  \n \nThe  investment  cost  of  the  project  is  estimated  at  $594  million, \nincluding taxes and duties of $13 million. \n\n \n\nSource \nAsian Development Bank  \nMinistry of Communications \nChina Development Bank \nXinjiang Regional Government \n\nTotal \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\nTotal \n($ million) \n150 \n197 \n188 \n59 \n594 \n\n% \n25 \n33 \n32 \n10 \n100 \n\n\f \n\niii \n\nlending \n\nA  loan  of  $150  million  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources  will \nbe provided under ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-\nbased lending facility.

Better  road  transport  will  encourage  the \nproduction  and  export  of  local  products  and  higher-value  cash \ncrops,  and  promote  domestic  tourism.  The  Project  will  benefit \n1.06 million  people,  including  0.6  million  people  involved  in \nagriculture, of whom 16.6% are poor. The economic internal rate \nof  return  for  the  Project  is  20.5%.  The  financial  internal  rate  of \nreturn  is  5.06%,  which  is  higher  than  the  real  weighted  average \ncost of capital. The upgrade of local roads will facilitate easier and \nsafer  access  to  schools,  hospitals,  and  markets  for  about \n50,000 rural  people,  consisting  mainly  of  poor  and  ethnic \nminorities. The construction of the expressway and rural roads will \nalso  provide  direct  employment  and  training  benefits  for  local \npeople.  About  10.3 million  person-days  of  employment \n(8,500 laborers for 4 years), generating CNY400 million in wages, \nwill  benefit  the  local  communities,  who  will  also  benefit  from  the \nprovision of materials and services during construction. \n \nThe  Project  has  been  designed  taking  into  consideration  the \npotential  financial  and  social  risks.  The  financial  risks  relating  to \nconstruction  and  operations  of  the  expressway  will  depend  on \n(i) the  actual  level  and  composition  of  traffic,  (ii)  the  capital  cost, \n(iii)  XCD  capacity,  and  (iv)  the  tolls  charged.  To  control  the \nfinancial  risks  (i)  the  Project  will  receive  significant  injections  of \nequity  from  central  and  provincial  governments,  (ii)  XCD  will \nensure smooth expressway operations, and (iii) an appropriate toll \nstructure  will  be  adopted.

The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nA. \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n2. \nRecognizing  the  need  for  rapid  development  of  the  transport  sector  to  meet  the \ndemands of high economic growth, the Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China has been \ninvesting heavily in transport infrastructure and services over the last two decades. Since 1990, \nthe demand for passenger transport has grown at an annual average rate of 7.8%, and freight \ntransport  has  grown  at  7.6%.  This  has  led  to  an  increase  in  the  modal  share  of  roads, \nparticularly for passenger traffic; by 2006, road transport carried 52.8% of passenger traffic and \n11.1% of freight traffic. \n \n3. \nTo  address  the  major  road  infrastructure  needs,  the  Government  has  taken  several \ninitiatives.  In  1990,  the  National  Trunk  Highway  System  was  introduced,  aimed  at  the \nconstruction  of  12  high-standard  key  highways  extending  35,000  kilometers  (km)  along  the \nmajor  road  transport  corridors.  In  1998,  the  Western  Region  Development  Plan  (WRDP)  was \ninitiated  to,  among  others  things,  develop  eight  road  corridors  (18,000  km)  in  the  western \nprovinces to link with the eastern PRC and the neighboring countries in the west. In 2005, the \nGovernment unveiled the National Expressway Development Plan to construct 34 expressways \nall over the country,1 covering a total of 85,000 km and providing access to the majority of the \nPRC\u2019s  population.  In  addition,  the  Government  initiated  a  national  Rural  Roads  Construction \nProgram  under  the  11th  Five-Year  Plan  (11FYP)  2006\u20132010  to  address  the  issues  of  lagging \nrural development and widening rural-urban income disparities. \n \n4. \nBy  the  end  of  2006,  the  total  road  network  in  the  PRC  had  grown  to  3.46  million  km, \nconsisting  of  45,300  km  of  expressways,  45,300  km  of  class  I  roads,  262,270  km  of  class  II \nroads,  354,700  km  of  class  III  roads,  1,574,800  km  of  class  IV  roads,  and  1,174,100  km  of \nunclassified  roads.  In  2006,  the  total  annual  investment  in  road  development  reached \nCNY623 billion,  which  is  an  increase  of  13.6%  over  2005.  During  the  11FYP,  construction  of \n24,000  km  of  expressway  is  planned,  taking  the  total  to  65,000  km  by  2010.  In  addition, \n46,000 km  of  major  roads  and  130,000  km  of  paved  access  roads  will  be  constructed  in  the \ncounties,  and  280,000  km  of  major  rural  roads  and  540,000  km  of  paved  access  roads  will \nconnect the villages. \n \nThe  WRDP,  involving  12  provinces  and/or  regions,2 addressed  the  needs  of  the  less-\n5. \ndeveloped western region. While aiming to reduce the imbalance in economic development, the \nWRDP played an important role in promoting cooperation of the western region with neighboring \ncountries and integration with the rest of the country. Among other things, the WRDP addressed \nthe  need  for  development  of  the  road  network  in  the  western  region  to  provide  access  to  its \npopulation spread over a large area, and stronger links with the eastern provinces. An estimated \n$84  billion  was  to  be  spent  over  10  years.  Road  development  under  the  WRDP  includes \n(i) improving  eight \nregion, \nintraprovincial  roads,  and \n(ii) rehabilitating \n                                                 \n1   Also  called  the  7918  network,  which  includes  7  expressways  radiating  from  Beijing,  9  north\u2013south  expressways, \n\n.and  upgrading  180,000  km  of \n\nlinking  western  provinces \n\nroad  corridors \n\nthe  eastern \n\ninter-  and \n\nto \n\nand 18 east\u2013west expressways. \n\n2   The  western region consist of Chongqing,  Gansu, Guangxi, Guizhou, Inner Mongolia, Ningxia, Qinghai, Shaanxi, \n\nSichuan, Xinjiang, Xizang (Tibet), and Yunnan. \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\n(iii) improving  150,000 km  of  local  roads.  Implementation  of  the  WRDP  continues  under  the \n11FYP, and all major road corridors are planned to be completed by 2010. \n \n6. \nRoad transport dominates surface transport in Xinjiang, accounting for 96% of the total \npassenger traffic (65% of the total passenger km) and 82% of the total freight (39% of the total \ntons per km). This is higher than the national average and the demand is increasing. In 2005, \nthe  demand  for  passenger  transport  grew  by  8.9%,  and  for  freight  transport  by  12.2%.  By  the \nend  of  2005,  the  total  road  network  in  Xinjiang  was  89,530  km,  which  included  541  km  of \nexpressways, 885 km of class I roads, 6,993 km of class II roads, 23,880 km of class III roads, \nand 57,233 km of class IV and unclassified roads. There are eight national highways connecting \nXinjiang  with  the  neighboring  provinces  of  Gansu,  Qinghai,  and  Xizang  in  the  east  and  south, \nand to the Central Asian countries and Mongolia in the west and north. During the 11FYP, the \nXinjiang  Uygur  Autonomous  Regional  Government  (XUARG)  plans  to  construct  657  km  of \nexpressways, 6,357 km of class I and II roads, 2,866 km of class III and unclassified roads, and \n32,000 km of major rural roads. \n \nB. \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\n7. \nThe  economic  development  in  eastern  PRC  has  significantly  outpaced  development  in \nother  regions.  This  is  partly  due  to  the  fact  that  70%  of  the  population  is  concentrated  in  the \neast,  but  it  is  more  because  industrial  output  has  resulted  in  major  increases  in  per  capita \nincome.  The  western  region  mainly  relies  on  supplying  of  raw  materials.  Situated  in  the \nnorthwestern  corner  of  the  PRC  and  farthest  from  the  economically  developed  eastern \nprovinces,  Xinjiang  has  a  land  area  of  1,665,000  square  km  (km2),  which  is  one  sixth  of  the \nPRC. The Tianshan mountain range in the north, the Kunlunshan mountain range in the south, \nand the large Tarim desert in the southern half are the main geographical features of Xinjiang. \nThe  province  is  made  up  of  five autonomous  prefectures,  two  prefecture-level  cities,  seven \nadministrative offices, 20 cities, 68 counties, and 999 townships and towns. The total population \nof  20.2  million  (2005)  is  widely  distributed,  and  this  increases  the  isolation  and  remoteness  of \nthe communities. Over 60% of the population (12.6 million) is engaged in agriculture. Xinjiang is \none  of  the  less-developed  provinces.  The  net  income  per  capita  for  farmers  is  CNY2,482,  or \n76%  of  the  national  average.  The  poverty  incidence  is  18%  (2005),  higher  than  the  national \naverage  of  10%,  and  is  concentrated  in  southern  Xinjiang,  where  80%  of  the  poor  population \nresides and where the Project is located. \n \n8. \nXUARG relies upon the Ministry of Communications (MOC) and loans from international \nfinancial  institutions  and  local  commercial  banks  for  financing  the  expressways.  The  Xinjiang \nCommunications Department (XCD) manages construction and operations of the expressways \nthrough  its  two  bureaus,  the  Xinjiang  Communications  Construction  Administration  Bureau \n(XCCAB)  and  the  Xinjiang  Highway  Administration  Bureau.  The  toll  income  is  used  to  service \nthe  loans  and  cover  operation  and  maintenance  costs.  However,  reliance  on  these  traditional \nsources  to  meet  the  long-term  demand  of  road  infrastructure  development  in  Xinjiang  is  not \nsustainable.  XCD  still  has  a  long  way  to  go  in  transforming  itself  into  a  market-oriented \ninstitution  when  compared  to  the  other  provinces,  particularly  in  the  eastern  region  where  the \nprovision  of  transport  infrastructure  and  services  has  gradually  shifted  to  independent \nenterprises with private sector involvement in financing and operations. \n \n9. \nWhile the PRC has achieved rapid economic development, the rural areas have lagged \nbehind,  leading  to  widening  income  inequalities.  One  reason  for  this  disparity  is  the  lack  of \naccess  in  rural  areas.  The  rural  roads  development  targets  under  the  11FYP  include  the \nprovision  of  a  paved  road  connection  to  (i) all  townships  and  administrative  villages  in  the \neastern  region,  (ii) all  townships  and  80%  of  administrative  villages  in  the  central  region,  and \n\n\f3 \n\n(iii) 90%  of  townships  and  50%  of  administrative  villages  in  the  western  region.  The  major \nissues in implementing the 11FYP rural roads development targets are (i) inadequate financing; \n(ii) capacity  constraints  at  county,  township,  and  village  levels;  (iii)  the  absence  of  appropriate \ndesign standards for low-volume roads; and (iv) lack of maintenance. XUARG has developed a \n5-year plan (2006\u20132010) for development of rural roads in Xinjiang. This involves construction, \nrehabilitation,  and  improvement  of  65,000  km  of  rural  roads  at  an  estimated  cost  of \nCNY16.1 billion. \n \n10.  Major  reforms  have  been  undertaken  in  the  PRC  to  improve  road  transport  services. \nFreight transport has been deregulated since the mid-1980s, allowing the market to set service \nstandards  and  freight  tariffs.  Similarly,  under  the  existing  regulatory  arrangements  governing \nroad  passenger  services,  the  quality  of  long-distance  services  between  county-level  and \ntownship-level centers has improved considerably. However, for township-to-village and village-\nto-village  bus  routes,  there  are  several  shortcomings,  mostly  related  to  the  strict  regulatory \nregime.  The  major  problems  are  (i)  poor  road  conditions  preventing  the  issuance  of  route \nlicense,  (ii) the  requirement  for  the  existence  of  a  township  or  village  bus  terminal  before \ntransport services can commence, (iii) extensive licensing restrictions for operators and routes, \nand (iv) restrictions on the type of vehicle which can be used. \n \n11. \nAs part of developing Urumqi as a regional transport hub and logistics center, MOC and \nXUARG signed the Urumqi Road Transport Hub Terminal Development Program agreement in \nNovember  1997.  According  to  this  program,  six  freight  terminals,  six  passenger  terminals,  an \ninternational freight and passenger terminal, and an administration terminal were planned; these \nare  in  various  stages  of  development.  The  trade  volume  imbalance  between  exports  and \nimports,  and  the  cyclical  nature  of  agricultural  produce  in  Xinjiang,  adversely  affects  the \nefficiency  of  freight  terminal  operations.  Trucks  looking  for  back  loads  wait  10\u201314  days  on \naverage, or return unloaded. In some cases, drivers are willing to accept lower rates in order to \nsecure a cargo and then increase the rates on the return journey, while in other cases increases \nin  the  freight  rates  on  cargo  to  destinations  with  back-loading  problems  are  being considered. \nAs a direct result of the lower vehicle utilization rate, transport costs have increased. Although \nthe program includes a plan to establish an integrated terminal system, which would connect the \nadministration center and freight terminals through a web-based logistics information exchange \nsystem, there is a lack of the information and communication technology (ICT) expertise needed \nto implement such a system. The problem and constraints analysis is in Appendix 2. \n \n12. \nTwo of the eight major road corridors under the WRDP are in Xinjiang: the Altay\u2013Kyutun \ncorridor, and the Xiaocahu (near Urumqi)\u2013Hotan corridor. The Korla\u2013Kuqa project expressway \nis  part  of  the  Xiaocahu\u2013Hotan  corridor.  It  traverses  east\u2013west  along  the  southern  foot  of  the \nTianshan  mountains  and  passes  through  Korla  city  and  Luntai  county  (in  Bayangol  Mongol \nAutonomous  Prefecture)  and  Kuqa  county  (in  Aksu  administrative  office).  The  expressway  is \npart  of  the  traditional  Silk  Road  and  is  a  major  trade  link  to  the  Central  and  South  Asian \ncountries (Map 1). The expressway connects the capital city of Urumqi with Kashgar city, which \nconnects  to  (i)  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  through  border  crossings  at  Irkeshtam  and  Torugart, \n(ii) Pakistan  through  the  border  crossing  at  Kunjirap,  and  (iii)  to  Tajikistan  through  the  border \ncrossing  at  Kalasu.  The  expressway  also  serves  as  the  main  access  for  tourists  visiting  the \nhistorical  sites  in  the  project  area.  Most  importantly,  the  expressway  connects  the  less-\ndeveloped southern part of Xinjiang via recently completed class II highways from Kuqa county \nto Hotan administrative office, and from Luntai county to Minfeng and Qiemo counties (Map 2). \n \n13. \nXinjiang\u2019s economy is growing steadily; gross domestic product (GDP) grew by 11% in \n2006. Although agriculture remains significant, it has declined from 31% of GDP in 1990 to 20% \nin  2005.  Current  economic  growth  is  dominated  by  secondary  industry,  which  includes  the \n\n \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\nsupply  of  power,  water,  and  gas,  and  construction.  It  constituted  44%  of  GDP  in  2005, \ncompared  to  31%  in  1990.  Tertiary  industry  (including  transport  and  storage,  finance,  real \nestate,  retail  and  wholesale,  education,  healthcare,  community  services,  and  public \nadministration)  is  the  second-most  important  sector,  accounting  for  36%  of  GDP  in  2005. \nImprovement  of  transport  infrastructure  will  contribute  significantly  to  trade  and  industry, \nexports, agriculture production, tourism, and the overall economic development of Xinjiang. \n \n14. \nExternal  assistance  to  the  road  sector  in  the  PRC  has  come  mainly  from  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB), the Japan Bank for International Cooperation, and the World Bank. \nSince  1991,  ADB  has  extended  36  loans  and  64  technical  assistance  (TA)  projects.  Project \ncompletion  reports  prepared  for  18 road  projects  concluded  that  17  were  highly  or  generally \nsuccessful and one was partly successful.3 The advisory TA projects have addressed policy and \ninstitutional  issues,  including  (i)  highway  planning,  (ii)  road  safety,  (iii)  human  resource \ndevelopment,  (iv)  socioeconomic  assessment,  (v)  transport  pricing,  and  (vi)  mobilization  of \nnongovernmental financial resources. ADB coordinates closely with both these organizations in \nthe selection of corridors for financing and to ensure a unified approach in pursuing the sector \nreform agenda with the Government (Appendix 4). \n \n\n1. \n\nGovernment and ADB Strategies \n\n \nUnder the 11FYP, the Government aims to provide balanced, equitable, and sustainable \n15. \ndevelopment. There is strong emphasis on rural development and the Government pledges to \nincrease  farmers\u2019  incomes,  improve  infrastructure,  and  enhance  public  services  in  the \ncountryside.  Road  development  has  been  a  high  priority  as  an  effective  means  of  promoting \neconomic growth and reducing poverty. The WRDP focuses on reducing regional disparities by \n(i)  linking  the  western  provinces  with  the  central  and  eastern  regions,  (ii)  providing  access  to \ntrade  through  corridors  to  sea  and  land  ports,  and  (iii)  promoting  regional  cooperation  with \nneighboring countries. \n \n16. \nADB\u2019s operational strategy in the PRC for the road sector gives high priority to removing \ninfrastructure  constraints  and  supporting  policy  and  institutional  reforms.  ADB  supports \n(i) building roads that connect major growth centers, and improving access in the western and \ncentral  regions;  (ii)  integrating  the  road  network  so  that  the  national  trunk  highway  system  is \nsupported by a system of secondary and tertiary roads, particularly those that provide access to \npoor  areas;  (iii)  promoting  road  safety  and  reducing  vehicle  emissions;  (iv) strengthening \ncorporatization  and  commercialization  of  expressway  organizations;  (v) adopting  appropriate \npricing  policies  to  ensure  optimum  use  of  road  transport  capacity;  and  (vi)  using  alternative \nmethods  of  investment  financing,  including  private  sector  participation.  ADB  road  sector \nassistance targets the poor western provinces and regional economic corridors. The Project is \nconsistent  with  the  PRC\u2019s  development  priorities  and  ADB\u2019s  strategy.  A  road  sector  analysis \nand policy reform matrix is in Appendix 3. \n\n \n2. \n\nLessons Learned \n\n \nXCD  has  implemented  three  World  Bank-financed  highway  improvement  projects 4 \n17. \nduring the period 1994\u20132007; the last one is nearing completion. The lessons from the first two \n                                                 \n3   The \u201cpartly successful\u201d rating is mainly due to inadequate safety facilities and enforcement. Remedial actions were \ntaken  to  rectify  the  issues.  The  Project  was  rated  \u201csuccessful\u201d  in  the  project  performance  audit  report  after  the \nremedial measures were taken. \n\n4   World  Bank.  1994.

WB. \n\n\f \n\n5 \n\nprojects include the following: (i) there is a need for improved traffic forecasting on tolled roads, \n(ii) road safety should be addressed at the national level as part of the policy dialogue with the \nGovernment,  (iii)  institutional  and  capacity-development  activities  should  complement  the \nexecution of major tasks under the Project, and (iv) toll rates should be affordable. In addition, \npast  ADB-financed  projects  have  highlighted  the  need  for  proper  management  of  social \nsafeguard issues, particularly relating to ethnic minorities. \n \n18. \nExtensive  traffic  analysis  (including  growth  of  traffic  on  the  existing  expressways \ndeveloped with the World Bank\u2019s assistance and in operation since 1999) has been carried out \nfor the project expressway to ensure that the traffic projections are realistic. Road safety is part \nof  the  ongoing  policy  discussions  with  the  Government,  and  several  initiatives  have  been \nundertaken  at  the  national  level  towards  the  development  of  an  effective  and  sustainable \nframework  for  improving  road  safety.5 The  Project  continues  with  the  capacity  development \ninitiated under the World Bank projects and ensures that it reflects the current needs. XUARG \ncarried out the toll-rate analysis for each new road. Based on the findings that the rates differed \nonly  slightly  between  roads,  XUARG  decided  that  it  was  administratively  more  convenient  to \nadopt uniform toll rates for all toll roads. XCD has assured that the toll rates currently applicable \non  the  other  expressways  will  be  applied  to  the  project  expressway.  With  regard  to  social \nsafeguards, XCD has good management and experience, and during project implementation its \nstaff will liaise regularly with local government officials. \n \n\n3. \n\nPolicy Dialogue \n\n \n19. \nEncouraging  Private  Sector  Participation.  XCD  has  been  seeking  private  sector \ninvolvement in expressways from experienced operators. However, there is little interest due to \nrelatively  low  traffic  volumes  and  high  risks.  Discussion  is  ongoing  with  XCD  to  (i)  introduce \ncorporatization of expressway operations as a first step towards private sector involvement; and \n(ii)  introducing  innovative  instruments  for  private  sector  participation,  such  as  annuity-based \nconcessions, to share the potential risk posed by low traffic volumes. An international expert will \nbe engaged under the Project to develop a strategy for private sector participation, including an \naction plan identifying the steps needed to encourage private sector involvement. \n \nRural  Road  Development.  An  ADB-financed  TA  project6 has  addressed  major  issues \n20. \n(para. 9)  in  implementing  rural  road  development  programs  and  the  major  recommendations \ninclude  (i) raising  local  government  revenues  through  a  levy  on  property  tax  and  collecting  a \nroad maintenance fee from vehicles that are currently exempted; (ii) incorporating new class V \nroads and village roads in the highway law; (iii) making provincial governments responsible for \ncapacity  development  of  the  staff  at  county,  township,  and  village  levels;  (iv)  improving \ndatabases;  and  (v)  introducing  a  pavement  management  system  and  contract  maintenance. \nMOC  supports  the  recommendations  and  is  working  closely  with  ADB  in  developing  a \nframework for implementation (Appendix 5).  \n \n21. \nImproving Rural Transport Services. In the PRC, rural transport services for township-\nto-village  and  village-to-village  bus  routes  are  costly,  unreliable,  and  unsafe.  The  major \nshortcomings, mostly related to the strict regulatory regime, are (i) poor road conditions which \nprevent  the  issuance  of  route  licenses,  (ii)  the  requirement  for  the  existence  of  a  township  or \nvillage  bus  terminal  before  transport  services  can  commence,  (iii)  extensive  licensing \nrestrictions  for  operators  and  routes,  and  (iv)  restrictions  on  the  type  of  vehicle  which  can  be \n\n                                                 \n5   ADB. 2005.

Under  an  ADB-financed  TA  project,7 these  issues  have  been  addressed.  The  proposed \nreforms  involve  (i)  changes  in  the definition,  licensing,  and  regulation  of  rural  buses,  rural  bus \nroutes,  rural  bus  operators,  and  rural  bus  terminals  to  encourage  more  demand-responsive, \ntownship-based  operators  and  give  them  the  freedom  and  flexibility  to  offer  efficient  services \nwhich  are  more  capable  of  responding  to  users\u2019  needs;  and  (ii)  corresponding  measures  to \nclarify  the  role  and  strengthen  the  capacity  of  county-level  road  transport  administrations  in \nrelation  to  the  recommended  regulatory  changes.  MOC  supports  these  recommendations  and \nhas agreed to implement them on a pilot basis in selected road projects in the provinces.  \n \n22. \nEnhancing  Road  Safety.  Road  safety  is  a  major  issue  in  the  PRC,  especially  in \nXinjiang. In the PRC in 2005, there were 567,753 road accidents, resulting in 451,810 injuries \nand 99,217 fatalities. In Xinjiang, during the period from 1996 to 2005, over 25,000 people were \nkilled and over 75,000 people injured in road traffic accidents. Fatalities increased from 1,863 in \n1996, to 2,491 in 2000, and 2,588 in 2006. In 2006, the estimated economic losses from road \naccidents and fatalities in Xinjiang exceeded CNY16.63 million. The Ministry of Public Security, \nwhich  is  responsible  for  enforcement  of  traffic  laws  and  regulations,  is  committed  to  reducing \ntraffic \naccidents \nmanagement.  Road  safety  is  given  high  priority  in  Xinjiang,  but  there  is  still  a  lot  of  work \nrequired to achieve safe road travel.  \n \n\nimproved  safety  of  vehicles,  driver \n\ntraining,  and \n\nimproved \n\nthrough \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nThe impact of the Project is to develop a more efficient national and regional transport \n23. \nsystem that supports sustainable economic growth in Xinjiang. The outcome of the Project is to \nimprove  transport  capacity  and  safety  of  the  regional  road  corridor  and  the  local  roads  in \nsouthern Xinjiang. \n \nB. \n\nOutputs \n\n24. \nThe Project has the following outputs: (i) upgrading the 296.5-km Korla\u2013Kuqa section of \nthe  existing  two-lane  class  II  national  highway  (G314)  to  a  four-lane  access-controlled  tolled \nexpressway;  (ii)  rehabilitating  three  priority  local  roads  totaling  193  km  in  Kuqa  and  Qiemo \ncounties  to  class  III  or  IV,  providing  access  to  remote  and  poorer  areas  of  Xinjiang; \n(iii) improving  operational  efficiency  of  freight  terminals  in  Urumqi  by  introducing  a  web-based \ntransport  logistics  system;  (iv)  improving  rural  transport  services  by  pilot  testing  of  bus  route \nlicensing reforms in Kuqa county; (v) improving road safety through (a) conducting a safety audit \nfor the project roads, (b) developing an action plan to ensure safe operation of the expressway, \n(c)  installing  modern  traffic  safety  devices  along  the  project  roads,  (d)  increasing  public \nawareness  through  training,  and  (e)  providing  a  traffic  surveillance  monitoring  system  for \nensuring  road  safety  during  winter  and  for  controlling  speeds  on  the  project  expressway;  and \n(vi)  enhancing  XCD  capacity  through  the  provision  of  consulting  services,  equipment,  and \ntraining. \n \nC. \n\nSpecial Features \n\n25. \nStrengthening  Regional  Cooperation.  As a gateway of the PRC to the Central Asian \ncountries, Xinjiang is considered an important part of the land bridge linking Asia and Europe. \nXinjiang shares a 5,600-km border with eight neighboring countries which are mostly members \n\n                                                 \n7   ADB.  2006.  Technical  Assistance  to  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  for  Sustainable  Rural  Transport  Services. \n\nManila. \n\n \n\n\f7 \n\nof  the  Central  Asia  Regional  Economic  Cooperation  (CAREC)  program,8 and  is  working  with \nthese  countries  to  improve  the  region\u2019s  transport  infrastructure  and  reduce  the  cost  of  trade \nacross  the  region.  The  CAREC  Transport  and  Trade  Facilitation  Strategy9 is  being  developed \nand  aims  to  (i) accelerate  economic  growth  and  reduce  poverty  by  upgrading  key  transport \ncorridors across the CAREC region, (ii) improve the region\u2019s competitiveness, and (iii) expand \ntrade among the CAREC economies and with the rest of the world. Key elements of the strategy \nare  the  coordinated  improvement  of  transport  infrastructure  along  the  six  priority  transport \ncorridors;  the  Project  supports  this  strategy.  The  Urumqi\u2013Kashgar  road  in  Xinjiang  is  part  of \nthree among four CAREC transport corridors connecting Xinjiang with Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyz \nRepublic, Mongolia, and Tajikistan; it also forms part of Asian Highway 4 (AH-4) (Map 3). The \nKorla\u2013Kuqa  section  is  part  of  the  Urumqi\u2013Kashgar  road,  which  is  becoming  heavily  trafficked. \nThe  Project  will  upgrade  the  existing  Korla\u2013Kuqa  highway  to  a  four-lane  expressway  and \nimprove the operational efficiency of freight terminals to (i) increase the flow of goods through \nthe region, (ii) reduce travel times and costs, and (iii) increase vehicle utilization. Together with \nother financial institutions, ADB is assisting CAREC member countries to improve their regional \nroad  connections  with Xinjiang.  With  ADB  assistance,  the upgrading  of  the  Sary  Tash\u2013Nimich \nroad (which links the Kyrgyz Republic and Tajikistan), the Torugart\u2013Bishkek road in the Kyrgyz \nRepublic, and the Guzar\u2013Dautata (Kazakhstan border) road in Uzbekistan are all planned with \nthe  same  time  frame  as  the  Project  in  Xinjiang.  The  Korla\u2013Kuqa  expressway  will  link  these \ncountries to Mongolia and the Russian Federation via the highway in northern Xinjiang and the \nproposed road in western Mongolia. The Government will also rehabilitate the 110-km Torugart\u2013\nKashgar  border  road  through  its  own  funding  during  the  implementation  period  of  the  Project. \nWith these connections, the Korla\u2013Kuqa expressway will help to foster economic development \nand  promote  interregional  trade,  and  will  serve  as  an  important  transport  corridor  ensuring \nefficient and safe movement of goods and passengers. The expressway plays a critical role in \nfurthering trade and regional cooperation, which will also benefit from the CAREC Transport and \nTrade Facilitation Strategy. \n \nAt the national level, four major road sections in Xinjiang are planned under the National \n26. \nExpressway  Development  Plan.  Two  of  these  four  road  sections  form  part  of  the  east\u2013west \ncorridor  between  Irkeshtam,  on  the  border  with  the  Kyrgyz  Republic,  and  Xinxingxia,  on  the \nborder  of  Xinjiang  and  Gansu  provinces.  The  project  expressway  is  part  of  the  Irkeshtam\u2013\nXinxingxia  corridor;  an  expressway  from  Korla  to  Turpan  has  been  completed  and  the  civil \nworks from Turpan to Xinxingxia are ongoing, with completion scheduled for 2010. XCD plans to \ncomplete the remaining section from Kuqa to Irkeshtam by 2020 and has recently completed a \nfeasibility study for the 250-km Kuqa\u2013Aksu section .  \n \n27. \nLocal  Roads  Improvement. The Project will improve three priority local roads totaling \n193 km to meet class III or IV standards: (i) the reconstruction of the 30-km Wuqia township\u2013\nDunkuotan township road in Kuqa county, (ii) the 73-km G315 road between New Long March \nBridge and Aqiang township road, and (iii) the 90-km G315 road between Suntang Maintenance \nOffice and Aoyiyalake township in Qiemo county. The selection of road priorities, carried out in \naccordance with  the  local  road  management  regulations, initially  identified  17 local roads  from \nXCD\u2019s plan. At the end of a screening process, based on criteria that included (i) serving poorer \nareas, (ii) the number of villages served, (iii) poor road condition, (iv) connectivity to an existing \nnetwork, (v) access to social services, (vi) traffic levels, and (vii) environmental and resettlement \n                                                 \n8   CAREC is an alliance of eight countries: Afghanistan, Azerbaijan, the People\u2019s Republic of China, Kazakhstan, the \nKyrgyz  Republic,  Mongolia,  Tajikistan,  and  Uzbekistan;  and  six  multilateral  institutions:  the  Asian  Development \nBank,  the  European  Bank  for  Reconstruction  and  Development,  the  International  Monetary  Fund,  the  Islamic \nDevelopment Bank, the United Nations Development Programme, and the World Bank. \n\n9   The draft CAREC Transport and Trade Facilitation Strategy including six key transport corridors to be established \nacross  the  CAREC  region  have  been  endorsed  at  the  6th  Ministerial  Conference  on  CAREC  held  in  Dushanbe, \nTajikistan on 3 November 2007.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nconsiderations, three local roads were selected: one in Kuqa county (mixed class III and IV) and \nthe  other  two  in  Qiemo  county  (both  class  IV).  These  local  roads  are  connected  to  the \nexpressway  through  the  national  highway  network  that  will  bring  both  transport  and  economic \nbenefits to the local poor and minority groups. \n \n28. \nImproving Efficiency of Freight Terminals. To accommodate the need to improve the \nefficiency  of  freight  terminal  operations  and  to  integrate  individual  terminals  for  better \nadministration, a web-based logistics information system is proposed under the Project so that \nUrumqi  can  be  developed  as  a  transport  hub  not  only  for  Xinjiang  but  also  between  the  PRC \nand the CAREC countries.10 The Project will assist XCD in the introduction of ICT through the \nprovision of international and national consulting services and software (Appendix 6) to facilitate \nan efficient, secure pick up and delivery service. A web-based system will increase efficiency in \nterminal operations by providing not only better visibility over the location of cargo and available \nfreight  forwarders  but  also  the  ability  to  track  consignments  to  the  point  of  delivery.  In  turn, \nimproved  terminal  operations  will  generate  substantial  long-term  economic  returns  to  the \nregional  economy  through  savings  in  vehicle  operating  costs  and  time,  and  increasing  vehicle \nutilization  by  providing  real-time  information.  This  component  will  also  benefit  from  the \nrecommendations of the ongoing TA project for logistics development  and capacity building in \nXinjiang.11 \n \nImplementation  of  Bus  Route  Licensing  Reforms.  As  many  as  11  townships  and \n29. \n3,036 remote administrative villages in Xinjiang have no regular bus services, and rural travelers \nrely  on  motorized  three-wheeled  vehicles,  agricultural  tractors,  and  animal-powered  vehicles. \nPassenger bus productivity in Kuqa county is very low in terms of the average length of service \nper  bus  per  day.  This  results  in  long  waits  for  passengers  at  bus  stations  and  an  inability  to \nrotate  buses  onto  other  routes.  The  Project  will  provide  consulting  services  to  implement  pilot \nbus-route licensing reforms in Kuqa county and monitor the effects. Experience gained from the \npilot activity will be applied to other areas in Xinjiang (Appendix 7). \n \n30. \nImproving  Road  Safety.  The  Project  supports  XCD  efforts  to  improve  road  safety \nthrough (i) conducting a road safety audit for the project roads; (ii) developing an action plan to \nensure safe operation of the expressway; (iii) providing modern traffic safety devices along the \nproject  roads;  (iv)  enhancing  the  institutional  capacity  of  XCD  through  the  provision  of  winter \nmaintenance equipment and training; (v) improving public awareness, particularly in rural areas; \nand (vi) providing traffic surveillance monitoring systems for ensuring road safety during winter \nand for speed warning (Appendix 8). \n \nCapacity Development. XCD has received training through three World Bank projects12 \n31. \nfocused on (i) strengthening XCD and its jurisdiction units, and (ii) training XCD staff to satisfy \nthe  needs  for  construction  and  management  of  high-grade  highways  in  Xinjiang.  To  further \nstrengthen  organizational  capability  and  improve  staff  quality  and  work  efficiency,  the  Project \nincludes a capacity-development component which will enhance XCD\u2019s capacity to (i) gradually \nmove towards private sector participation in expressway financing and operations, (ii) effectively \nundertake  road  maintenance  management,  (iii)  improve  rural  transport  services,  (iv)  improve \nroad  safety,  and  (v)  effectively  regulate  freight  terminals.  Better  utilization  of  allocated  funding \nfor  maintenance  is  an  issue  in  Xinjiang.  Under  World  Bank  projects,  XCD  has  received \n                                                 \n10  This is recommended under ADB\u2019s TA 6203-REG: Regional Trade Facilitation and Customs Cooperation Program \n(Phase II) for Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region Trade Facilitation and Logistics Development Research Project, \nJune 2006. \n\n11  ADB.  2006.  Technical  Assistance  to  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  for  Logistics  Development  and  Capacity \n\nBuilding in Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region. Manila. \n\n12  Through  three  highway  improvement  projects  during  the  period  1994\u20132007,  the  World  Bank  has  provided  loans \n\ntotaling $600 million. Capacity development was included under all these projects. \n\n\f9 \n\nequipment, systems, and training to develop its road maintenance capacity. However, there is a \nneed to build on this effort to address the gap between the road network needs and institutional \ncapacity  of  XCD,  particularly  at  the  local  government  (county,  township,  and  village)  levels.  In \norder  to  (i) continue  the  XCD  capacity-development  efforts,  (ii)  address  weak  capacity  in \nmaintenance  planning  by  county  and  township  communication  bureaus,  and  (iii)  facilitate \nimplementation of some of the recommendations provided by an ADB-financed TA project for a \nrural  roads  development  strategy  (footnote  8),  the  Project  will  provide  consulting  services  and \nrelated  training.  The  staff  trained  under  the  Project  will  develop  and  implement  a  plan  for \ncapacity  development  of  the  staff  of  selected  counties  and  townships  in  road  planning, \ndevelopment,  and  asset  management  (Appendix  9).  XCD  also  assured  that  expressway \nmaintenance  will  be  undertaken  by  XHAB,  and  local  road  maintenance  by  Qiemo  and  Kuqa \ncounty communication bureaus. The maintenance equipment to be procured under the Project \nwill  be  distributed  to  these  bureaus.  The  vehicle  weighing  stations  were  installed  at  terminals \nalong the highway network and regular checks are being carried out to prevent road pavement \ndamage  due  to  use  by  overloaded  trucks.  During  checks,  excess  goods  are  unloaded  and \nauthorization  to  continue  their  journey  is  given  to  truck  drivers.  However,  cases  have  been \nrecorded where, after receiving the authorization, drivers reload the excess goods. In an effort \nto prevent this practice, XCD is implementing effective enforcement through random checking of \ntrucks on the road. An additional weighbridge will be procured under the Project and its use will \nenhance XCD\u2019s ongoing effort. XCD will determine the appropriate location for the weighbridge \nduring project implementation, and through XHAB will enforce load limits. Road condition testing \nequipment  to  be  purchased  under  the  Project  will  be  allocated  to  XCCAB  to  facilitate  better \nplanning of maintenance activities based on road conditions.  \n \nD. \n\nProject Investment Plan \n\nThe  project  investment  cost  is  estimated  at  $594  million,  including  taxes  and  duties  of \n\n32. \n$13 million.

The  loan  will  have  a  25-year  term,  including  a  grace \nperiod  of  5  years,  an  interest  rate  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank \noffered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility,  a  commitment  charge  of  0.35%  per  annum,  and \nsuch  other  terms  and  conditions  set  forth  in  the  draft  loan  and  project  agreements.  The \nGovernment  has  provided  ADB  with  (i)  the  reasons  for  its  decision  to  borrow  under  ADB\u2019s \nLIBOR-based lending facility on the basis of these terms and conditions, and (ii) an undertaking \nthat  these  choices  were  its  own  independent  decision  and  not  made  in  reliance  on  any \ncommunication  or  advice  from  ADB.  The  ADB  loan  will  finance  25%  of  the  total  project  cost \n(Table 2). The Government, through MOC, XUARG, and a domestic bank (China Development \nBank) will finance the remaining project cost. The China Development Bank has appraised the \nProject  and  provided  a  commitment  letter  to  XCD.  MOC  and  XUARG  have  made  budgetary \nprovisions  for  the  counterpart  funds.  The  ADB  loan  proceeds  will  be  made  available  by  the \nGovernment to XUARG, which will onlend to XCD on the same terms and conditions as those of \nthe ADB loan, with XCD bearing the exchange rate and interest rate variation risk. \n\n \nTable 2: Financing Plan \n\nSource \nAsian Development Bank  \nMinistry of Communications \nChina Development Bank \nXinjiang Uygur Autonomous Regional Government \n \n\nTotal \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n \nF. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nTotal ($ million) \n150 \n197 \n188 \n59 \n594 \n\n% \n25 \n33 \n32 \n10 \n100 \n\n34.   Project Management. XCD will be the Executing Agency and will be responsible for the \noverall  implementation  of  the  Project.  The  director  general  of  XCD  will  be  the  project  director. \nXCCAB will be the implementing agency (IA) and will be responsible for all project components. \nXCCAB has implemented three similar projects financed by the World Bank, and thus has the \ntechnical,  management,  and  staff  capacity  to  undertake  this  Project.  XCCAB  has  already \nestablished  a  project  management  office  to  coordinate  activities  on  project  implementation \nincluding  (i)  loan  disbursement,  (ii)  procurement  of  civil  works  and  equipment,  (iii)  hiring  of \nconsultants, (iv) overseeing contract administration, (v) submitting progress and audit reports to \nADB,  and  (vi)  organizing  a  supervision  mission.  XCCAB  has  appointed  a  project  manager  for \nthe  day-to-day  management  of  project  implementation.  The  project  director  will  chair  regular \nmeetings  every  3  months,  or  more  often  if  necessary,  to  review  implementation,  resolve \ncoordination issues, and to provide guidance for timely completion of the project activities. \n \n35. \nJune 2012. The implementation schedule is in Appendix 11. \n \n36.   Procurement.  All  procurement  of  goods  and  works  financed  by  the  ADB  loan  will  be \ncarried out in accordance with ADB's Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to \ntime). Contracts for goods estimated to exceed $1.0 million and contracts for works estimated to \nexceed $10.0 million will be procured using international competitive bidding (ICB) procedures. \nContracts  for  goods  and  contracts  for  works  estimated  to  be  equal  to  or  less  than  the  above-\nmentioned  ICB  values,  but  more  than  $100,000,  will  be  procured  on  the  basis  of  national \ncompetitive bidding (NCB) procedures in accordance with the PRC Tendering and Bidding Law \n(1999), subject to modifications agreed with ADB. More details are provided in the procurement \n\nImplementation Period. The implementation period of the Project is from June 2007 to \n\n \n\n\f \n\n11 \n\nfor  (i) construction  supervision  of  project  roads,  (ii) implementation  of \n\nplan  (Appendix  12).  The  expressway  civil  works  will  be  divided  into  18  packages,  11  of  them \n(subgrade, pavement, bridges, and intersections) will be financed by ADB and procured under \nICB procedures. Out of these, nine will be procured with prequalification and two will be without \nprequalification where advance contracting is applied. The three local road sections financed by \nADB  will  be  procured  through  NCB.  Expressway  maintenance  equipment  will  be  divided  into \n15 packages,  five  of  which  will  be  financed  by  ADB  and  procured  through  NCB.  All  other \npackages,  including  traffic  engineering,  building  and  ancillary  facilities,  and  planting  and \nlandscaping  (including  road  condition  survey  equipment  and  maintenance  equipment)  will  be \nfinanced by the Government and procured under government bidding procedure acceptable to \nADB. \n \n37. \nConsulting  Services.  The  Project  will  finance  52  person-months  of  international \nconsulting  services.  Of  this,  45 person-months  will  be  used  for  the  expressway  involving  (i) a \ndeputy chief supervision engineer and international team leader (42 person-months), (ii) a road \nsafety expert (2 person-months), and (iii) a project monitoring and evaluation expert (1 person-\nmonth). The remaining 7 person-months will be used for (i) a private sector specialist (1 person-\nmonth),  (ii)  a  freight  terminal  specialist  (2  person-months),  and  (iii)  a  rural  transport  specialist \n(4 person-months).  All  consultants  to  be  financed  under  the  ADB  loan  will  be  selected  and \nengaged based on a full technical proposal using the quality and cost-based selection method13 \nin accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time \nto  time).  In  addition,  XCD  will  engage  and  finance  about  5,510 person-months  of  national \nconsultants \nthe \nenvironmental  management  plan  (EMP),  resettlement  plans,  and  ethnic  minority  development \nplans  (EMDPs),  (iii) monitoring  of  social  and  poverty  impacts  under  the  project  performance \nmonitoring system (PPMS), and (iv) assisting international consultants in (a) the introduction of \nICT  for  freight  terminals,  (b)  the  improvement  of  rural  transport  services,  (c)  road  safety \nimprovement, and (d) XCD\u2019s capacity development. The national consultants will be recruited in \naccordance with government procedures acceptable to ADB. Experienced domestic institutions \nwill be engaged for external monitoring of environmental mitigation, resettlement, and EMDPs. \nThe  chief  supervision  engineer  will  be  responsible  for  overall  project  supervision,  assisted  by \ntwo deputies, one of whom will be the team leader of the international consultants. Outline terms \nof reference for consultants are in Supplementary Appendix A. \n \n38.   Advance Contracting and Retroactive Financing. ADB approved advance contracting \non  6  June  2007;  this  includes  prequalification  of  contractors,  bidding,  bid  evaluation,  and \ncontract  awards.14 The  advance  contracting  will  be  undertaken  in  accordance  with  the  ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Guidelines. ADB also approved the requested retroactive financing not exceeding \n20% of the total ADB loan, or $30 million, on 2 July 2007 for two expressway civil works contract \npackages  and  international  consulting  services  to  be  awarded  in  the  beginning  of  2008.  The \nGovernment  has  been  advised  that  approval  of  the  advance  contracting  and  retroactive \nfinancing  does  not  commit  ADB  to  finance  the  Project.  The  expenditure  must  have  been \nincurred before loan effectiveness but, generally,  no earlier than 12 months before the date of \nsigning of the Loan Agreement. \n \nDisbursement Arrangements. The loan proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with \n39. \nADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2007, as amended from time to time). To facilitate project \nimplementation and funds flow, an imprest account will be set up upon loan effectiveness and \nwill  be  managed  by  the  Xinjiang  Finance  Department,  and  the  flow  of  funds  will  be  from  the \nXinjiang  Finance  Department  to  the  IA\u2019s  project  account.  The  financial  management \nassessment determined that XCD and the IA have adequate financial management, accounting \n                                                 \n13 The quality\u2013cost ratio is 80:20. \n14 Advance contracting was reported in the 10 July 2007 internet edition of ADB Business Opportunities. \n \n\n\f12 \n\nand  internal  control  capacity  and  can  provide  accurate  and  timely  information  on  financial \nstatus. (Supplementary Appendix B). The initial advance to be deposited to the imprest account \nwill not exceed either 6 months of estimated expenditure or 10% of the loan amount, whichever \nis lower. Direct payment procedures will apply for the large works contracts. If the government \ninitially funds eligible expenditures from its own resources, the reimbursement procedure will be \nused.  To  expedite  funds  flow  and  simplify  the  documentation  process,  the  statement  of \nexpenditures  procedure  will  be  used  for  liquidation  and  replenishment  of  the  imprest  account \nand  reimbursement  of  eligible  expenditures  not  exceeding  $200,00015 per  individual  payment. \nPayments  in  excess  of  the  statement  of  expenditures  ceiling  will  be  reimbursed,  liquidated,  or \nreplenished based on full supporting documentation. \n \n40. \nAccounting,  Auditing,  and  Reporting.  XCD  and  XCCAB  will  maintain  separate \naccounts  for  the  Project  and  related  financial  statements  for  the  expressway  and  local  road \ncomponents,  and  will  have  them  audited  annually  in  accordance  with  appropriate  auditing \nstandards consistently applied by external auditors whose qualifications, experience, and terms \nof reference are acceptable to ADB. XCD and XCCAB will submit to ADB within 6 months of the \nend  of  each  fiscal  year,  certified  copies  of  audited  project  accounts  and  financial  statements, \nand an auditor\u2019s report on the Project, in both English and Chinese. A separate audit opinion on \nthe use of the imprest account and statement of expenditures, if any, will be included as part of \nthe auditor\u2019s report. The Government was advised of ADB\u2019s requirement of timely submission of \naudited  project  accounts  and  financial  statements,  and  the  suspension  of  disbursement  of  the \nproposed ADB loan in case of noncompliance with the requirement. XCCAB has established an \ninternal audit unit in 2006, under the ongoing World Bank project, to ensure that internal controls \nand  checks  on  the  construction  cost  and  operations  are  effective.  This  unit  will  undertake \nindependent  tests  on  day-to-day  transactions  for  the  Project,  prior  to  referring  them  to  the \nexternal auditors. During project implementation, XCCAB will submit quarterly progress reports. \nXCD  and  XCCAB  will  submit  a  project  completion  report  to  ADB  within  3 months  of  the \ncompletion of the Project. \n \n41. \nAnticorruption  Policy.  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was \nexplained  to  and  discussed  with  the  central  and  provincial  governments.  Consistent  with  its \ncommitment  to  good  governance,  accountability  and  transparency,  ADB  reserves  the  right  to \ninvestigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive \npractices  relating  to  the  Project.  To  support  these  efforts,  relevant  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s \nAnticorruption  Policy  are  included  in  the  loan  regulations  and  the  bidding  documents  for  the \nProject.  In  particular,  all  contracts  financed  by  ADB  in  connection  with  the  Project  will  include \nprovisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and examine the records and accounts of XCD \nand  XCCAB,  and  all  contractors,  suppliers,  consultants,  and  other  service  providers  as  they \nrelate to the Project. \n \nDuring the project implementation, XCD and XCCAB will ensure that (i) officials from the \n42. \nDiscipline  and  Inspection  Bureau  monitor  bidding,  construction,  and  operations;  (ii) a  two-\ncontract  system  is  adopted  where  the  winner  of  a  civil  works  contract  will  also  sign  an \nanticorruption  contract  with  the  employer;  and  (iii)  periodic  inspection  of  contractors  is \nundertaken to ensure that funds withdrawal and settlement procedures are followed. XCD and \nXCCAB  will  initiate  liaison  with  the  prosecutor\u2019s  office,  on  an  as-needed  basis,  to discuss  any \nwarnings about, or information on, any corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices. \n \nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation. XCD will engage a national external \n43. \nmonitor  to  provide  16  person-months  of  services  for  developing  the  PPMS  indicators, \n                                                 \n15  In  line  with  the  adequate  financial  capability  of  XCD  and  the  IA  and  based  on  the  financial  management \nassessment, the ceiling of the statement of expenditure is identified at a higher level to facilitate disbursement.  \n\n \n\n\f \n\n13 \n\nestablishing  baseline  values  and  updating  them  during  project  implementation,  and  reporting. \nThe key indicators and assumptions outlined in the design and monitoring framework (Appendix \n1)  and  monitoring  of  socioeconomic  and  poverty  impacts  (Supplementary  Appendix  C)  will  be \nused  for  the  PPMS.  XCD  will  measure  the  indicators  for  project  evaluation  and  report  the  key \nfindings to ADB on project inception, during the midterm review, at completion, and annually for \n3 years after project completion. \n \n44. \nProject  Review.  About  2  years  after  the  Project  starts,  XCD,  XCCAB,  and  ADB  will \ncarry out a midterm review of the Project, covering all aspects of the Project that may have an \nimpact  on  its  performance  and  continuing  viability.  The  review  will  examine  the  progress  in \nimplementing  the  various  components,  policy  reforms,  progress  in  social  and  environmental \nsafeguard compliance, and compliance with assurances in the loan and project agreements. \n \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\nA. \n\nTraffic Forecast \n\n45. \nThe  Project  will  increase  the  existing  highway  capacity  to  meet  transport  demand  and \nwill  reduce  transport  costs  and  travel  times.  The  annual  average  daily  traffic  on  the  project \nexpressway  is  projected  to  grow  from  the  current  volume  of  3,100  vehicles  per  day  to  14,300 \nvehicles  per  day  by  2030.  The  annual  traffic  growth  rate  is  estimated  to  decrease  from  about \n9.5%  in  the  2006\u20132011  period  to  about  5%  in  the  2021\u20132030  period.  To  ensure  the  traffic \nprojections used to assess feasibility of the Project are realistic, the projected traffic growth was \ncompared  with  the  actual  traffic  growth  of  the  expressway  that  was  completed  with  the  World \nBank\u2019s assistance and has been in operation since 1999. The traffic volumes indicate that the \naverage  annual  growth  of  traffic  compares  well  with  the  traffic  growth  figures  for  the  project \nexpressway. \n \nB. \n\nEconomic Analysis \n\n46. \nThe project\u2019s economic internal rate of return (EIRR) was estimated by comparing with-\nproject  and  without-project  scenarios.  The  economic  costs  are  (i)  the  cost  of  capital  including \nland  acquisition  and  resettlement,  and  (ii)  the  operations  and  maintenance  costs  including \nreplacing  depreciated  equipment.  The  economic  benefits  are  (i)  savings  in  vehicle  operating \ncosts,  (ii)  time  savings  for  road  users,  and  (iii)  savings  in  road  accident  costs.  The  EIRR  for \nwhole Project is 20.5%, indicating that the Project is economically viable. The EIRR is 20% for \nthe  expressway  and  35%  for  the  local  roads.16 Results  of  a  sensitivity  analysis  confirm  the \nrobustness of the project\u2019s economic viability. The extended economic analysis to examine the \ndistribution  of  project  net  benefits  shows  that  road  users  will  receive  the  largest  share  of  net \nbenefits,  accounting  for  76%  of  the  total  net  benefit  (Appendix  13  and  Supplementary \nAppendix D). \n \nC. \n\nFinancial Analysis \n\nThe  financial  analysis  was  undertaken  in  accordance  with  the  ADB\u2019s  Financial \n47. \nManagement and Analysis of Projects (2005).17 The financial internal rate of return (FIRR) was \ncalculated based on the capital cost of the Korla\u2013Kuqa expressway, the traffic projections, and \nthe proposed toll rates.18 The calculated FIRR is 5.06% after taxes. The FIRR is higher than the \n\n                                                 \n16  The improved 193-km local road through a very small investment injection ($80,000 per km) will lead to significant \n\nsavings in vehicle operating costs and travel times.  \n\n17  ADB. 2005. Financial Management and Analysis of Projects. Manila. \n18  In Xinjiang a uniform toll rate is applied to all expressways in accordance with the provincial government\u2019s policy. \n \n\n\f14 \n\nweighted  average  cost  of  capital  (WACC)  of  3.21%,  and  therefore  the  Project  is  considered \nfinancially  viable.  Sensitivity  analysis  indicates  that  conditions  causing  the  project\u2019s  viability  to \nfall below the WACC would only occur in the unlikely scenario that capital costs of the project \nescalate by 29.1% and traffic is 21.4% below what is forecast (Appendix 14).  \n \nD. \n\nPoverty Reduction and Social Strategy \n\n48. \nSocioeconomic  Profiles.  Xinjiang is one of the less-developed provinces in the PRC, \nwith  a  per  capita  GDP  figure  of  CNY8,802  in  2005.  The  per  capita  rural  income  in  2005  was \nCNY2,482, or 76% of the national average. In 2005, the poverty incidence was 18% higher than \nthe national average of about 10%, and about 80% of the poor in Xinjiang live in the southern \npart where this Project is located. In the project area, the economy is dominated by agriculture \nand  oil  and  gas  development.  The  main  agricultural  products  include  wheat,  cotton,  fruit,  and \nlivestock.  The  project  areas  have  very  good  ecological  and  cultural  tourism  potential.  Rural \npoverty stems from (i) the remote and isolated location, (ii) limited access to irrigated farmland, \n(iii) natural disasters, (iv) the lack of modern technology and equipment, (v) low education levels \nand  technical  skills,  and  (vi)  poor  local  roads.  Poverty  is  extreme  in  Qiemo  county  and  quite \nsevere in Kuqa county. \n \n49. \nSocial Benefits. By increasing transport capacity on national highway G314, the Project \nwill provide the basis for lowering transport costs and increasing the flow of goods and people \nwithin and through the region, thereby supporting the poverty reduction strategy. The Project will \nbenefit 1.06 million people, including 0.6 million people involved in agriculture, of whom 16.6% \nare  poor.19 Upgrading  of  local  roads  will  facilitate  better  transport  services,  lower  fares,  and \nsafer  access  to  schools,  hospitals, and  markets  for  about  50,000  rural  people  who  are  mostly \npoor  people  and/or  ethnic  minorities.  The  construction  of  the  expressway  and  rehabilitation  of \nlocal  roads  will  also  provide  direct  employment  and  training  benefits  for  local  people.  About \n10.3 million  person-days  (8,500  laborers  for  4  years),  amounting  to  CNY400  million  in  wages, \nwill  benefit  the  local  communities.  They  will  also  benefit  from  the  provision  of  materials  and \nservices during construction. The summary poverty reduction and social strategy is included in \nAppendix 15. \n \nEthnic  Minorities  Development. Ethnic minorities in the project area comprise 63.1% \n50. \nof the total population and most of the absolute poor. The main ethnic group is the Uygur, who \nare Muslims. Ethnic minorities will be one of the primary beneficiaries of the Project, but due to \ntheir  vulnerability  they  also  bear  some  of  the  social  risks.  The  Uygur  will  be  targeted  for \nenhancement  measures,  including  priority  for  construction  employment  and  provision  of \nservices, small business promotion, and skill training. Enhancement measures are specified in \nthe EMDPs and resettlement plans; priority will be given to women to enhance direct and indirect \nproject benefits and to ensure that social risks, including community impacts, health, and road \nsafety,  are  minimized.  Consultation  has  been  carried  out  to  formulate  the  EMDPs  and  more \nintensive  consultation  and  participation  will  take  place  during  implementation.  The  summary \nEMDP is included in Appendix 16 and the EMDPs are in Supplementary Appendix E. \n\n                                                 \n19 Xinjiang  uses  an  official  rural  poverty  line  based  on  a  net  income  of  less  than  CNY882  per  person  per  year. \nHowever,  ADB  has  used  CNY1,200  per  person  per  year  for  Xinjiang  due  to  the  harsh  climatic  conditions  which \nincrease  basic  expenditures  (including  housing,  foodstuffs,  heating,  and  cooling).  Xinjiang  statistics  use  unique \ndefinitions for urban\u2013rural split, so \u201cagricultural persons\u201d has been used as a more accurate figure to use in order to \nestimate rural poverty. \n\n \n\n\f15 \n\nlocally  hired  workers \n\nfor  HIV/AIDS  and  other \n\nControl  and  Mitigation  of  Communicable  Diseases.  The  size  of  the  construction \n51. \nworkforce for this Project is not that large when compared to existing seasonal migration,20 so this \ninflux  can  be  managed  by  the  existing  health  services.  However,  it  will  be  necessary  to  utilize \nexisting  programs  to  ensure  that  the  local  population  is  specifically  targeted  to  raise  their \nawareness  of,  and  provide  access  to,  communicable-disease  prevention  measures.  The \nfollowing  measures  are  included  in  the  EMDPs:  (i) health  screening  of  contract  and  migrant \nworkers  and \ntransmittable  diseases \n(e.g., tuberculosis), (ii) awareness programs for construction workers and the local communities, \n(iii) monitoring  of  workers  and  possible  cases  of  communicable  disease  during  construction, \n(iv) culturally  sensitive  HIV/AIDS-awareness  program \nlocal \ncommunities,  and  (v)  an  awareness  campaign  targeted  at  high-risk  groups  at  the  start  of  the \nexpressway  operation.  Therefore,  health  awareness,  screening,  prevention,  and  treatment \nrequirements, as stipulated in the standard contract bidding document, will be monitored regularly \nfor  compliance.  Health  awareness  information  will  be  bilingual  and  provided  in  service  stations \nand bus passenger stations. \n \nBeneficiary Participation. More than 1,650 people were interviewed during the course \n52. \nof  public  opinion  surveys,  social  and  environmental  assessments,  and  resettlement  planning. \nOverall,  the  local  residents  believe  the  Project  will  improve  market  access,  economic \ndevelopment, transport connectivity, and access to education and health care, and will facilitate \nagricultural  diversity.  The  consultation  and  participation  process  has  influenced  the  project \ndesign  and  alignment  and  the  formulation  of  the  EMP,  resettlement  plans,  and  EMDPs, \nincluding measures to address some of the needs of the poor and women. \n \nE. \n\nLand Acquisition and Resettlement \n\ntargeted  at  women \n\nthe \n\nin \n\n53. \nThis is an involuntary resettlement category A project. XCD has prepared a resettlement \nplan  for  the  expressway  component  and  one  short  resettlement  plan  for  upgrading  the  local \nroad  in  Kuqa.  The  local  roads  upgrading  in  Qiemo  will  not  have  resettlement  impacts.  The \nsummary resettlement plan is in Appendix 17 and the resettlement plans are in Supplementary \nAppendix F. XCD has already prepared resettlement action plans for two of the expressway civil \nworks contract packages which it plans to award at the end of 2007. The project expressway will \ncross  29  villages  and  two  state  farms  in  Korla  city,  Luntai  county,  and  Kuqa  county.  Although \n1,145  hectares  (ha)  of  land  will  be  permanently  acquired,  only  7  ha  (0.6%)  is  farmland;  the \nnumber of people affected by partial land loss is 255. An estimated 35,287 square meters (m2) \nof  houses  will  be  demolished,  which  requires  relocation  of  124 households  (559  persons). \nConstruction  will  also  require  the  demolition  and  relocation  of  29  household  businesses, \n6 factories and 15 service stations. The local road in Kuqa county only requires 4 ha of land to \nbe  acquired,  and  this  is  collectively  owned  grassland;  no  structures  will  be  demolished. \nResettlement information booklets were distributed to affected village committees and affected \nhouseholds  in  November  2006.  XCCAB,  in  conjunction  with  the  local  land  administration \nbureaus,  will  be  responsible  for  implementing  resettlement  for  the  expressway  and  the  local \nroad  in  Kuqa  county.  During  project  implementation,  XCCAB  will  be  responsible  for  internal \nsupervision  and  monitoring,  and  will  prepare  resettlement  completion  reports.  In  addition,  an \nindependent  monitor  will  be  contracted  by  XCCAB  to  carry  out  external  monitoring  and \nevaluation. \n \n\n                                                 \n20 The construction of this expressway does not require any  tunneling,  which is labor intensive. The Project will not \ndirectly  cause  a  significant  influx  of  interregional  migrants.  The  maximum  number  of  paid  positions  over  the \nconstruction  period  will  be  12,000,  with  at  least  50%  being  employed  locally.  In  contrast,  every  year,  tens  of \nthousands of migrant workers come to harvest cotton, and others come for the expanding oil and gas development \n(e.g., between 1995 and 2000, more than 3.5 million people migrated to Xinjiang). \n\n \n\n \n\n\f16 \n\nF. \n\nEnvironmental Assessment \n\n54. \nThe  Project  is  classified  as  ADB  environmental  category  A.  There  are  no  protected \nenvironmental  areas  along  the  alignment  of  the  project  roads.  The  detailed  environmental \nimpacts  and  proposed  mitigation  measures  are  in  the  EMP  of  the  summary  environmental \nimpact assessment (SEIA) report (Supplementary Appendix G). The SEIA was circulated to the \nBoard  on  13  March  2007  and  was  made  public  through  the  ADB  website  on  14  March  2007. \nThe  major  potential  environmental  impacts  includes  (i)  noise  and  dust  during  construction, \nwhich may impact adjacent residential areas, and is mitigated through restricted working hours, \nnoise  barriers,  dust  suppression,  and  prevention  activities;  (ii)  three  designated  county-level \nhistoric  protection  sites  on  the  Korla\u2013Kuqa  expressway  that  will  require  close  construction \nsupervision and barriers to mitigate impacts; and (iii) possible soil erosion during construction, \nparticularly  at  the  active  earthworks  areas  requiring  mitigation  through  standard  engineering \nerosion  control  measures.  The  temporary  and  permanent  environmental  protection  measures \nare  included  in  the  civil  works  contracts.  Implementation  of  the  EMP  and  monitoring  plan \nincluded  in  the  environmental  impact  assessment  (EIA)  and  SEIA  are  part  of  the  consulting \nservices, and will ensure compliance with the environmental guidelines and procedures of ADB \nand the Government. \n \nG. \n\nRisks \n\n55. \nThe Project has been designed, with consideration given to potential financial and social \nrisks. The financial risks relating to construction and operations of the expressway will depend \non the actual level and composition of traffic, the construction cost, XCD capacity, and the tolls \ncharged.  To  control  the  financial  risks,  the  project  expressway  will  receive  significant  subsidy \nfrom the Government, XCD will ensure smooth expressway operations, and an appropriate toll \nstructure  will  be  adopted.  The  social  risks  involve  resettlement,  communicable  diseases,  and \nethnic  minorities  affected  by  the  Project.  Appropriate  mitigation  measures  have  been  taken  in \nthe resettlement plans and EMDPs. \n \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nIn addition to the standard assurances, the Government, XUARG and XCD have given \n\n56. \nthe following assurances, which will be incorporated in the legal documents. \n \nA. \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\n(i) \n\nthrough  XCD  will  ensure \n\nRural  Transport  Services.

This has \nled  to  an  increase  in  the  modal  share  of  roads,  particularly  for  passenger  transport.  The \nGovernment of the PRC has been investing heavily in transport infrastructure and services over \nthe last two decades. In 2006, road transport carried 52.8% of passenger traffic and 11.1% of \nfreight traffic. \n \n2. \nTo address the road infrastructure needs, the Government started several initiatives. In \n1990,  the  National  Trunk  Highway  System  was  introduced,  which  aimed  to  construct  12 high-\nstandard key highways of a total length of 35,000 kilometers (km). In 1998, under the Western \nRegion Development Program, plans were initiated to develop eight road corridors (18,000 km) \nin  the  western  provinces  to  link  with  the  central  and  eastern  regions  and  the  neighboring \ncountries in the west. In 2005, the Government unveiled the National Expressway Development \nPlan  to  construct  34  expressways  all  over  the  country,1 covering  a  total  of  85,000  km  and \nproviding access to the majority of the country\u2019s population. \n \nSince 1995, the PRC\u2019s road network has been growing at 20% per annum and reached \n3. \n3,457 million km in 2006. The bulk of financing is provided by the provincial governments and \nloans from domestic banks. In 2006, 41% of the resources were provided by local loans, 33% \nfrom the provincial and local governments, 16%  from the state budget (particularly the vehicle \npurchase  tax  revenues),  9%  from  the  private  sector  and  other  sources,  and  1%  from  foreign \nloans.  To  meet  the  massive  road  development  targets,  efforts  are  being  made  to  increase \nparticipation of the private sector and to explore use of the capital market instruments. \n \nB. \n \n4. \nWhile  the  PRC  has  achieved  rapid  economic  development,  rural  areas  have  lagged \nbehind, leading to widening income inequalities between urban and rural areas. One reason for \nthis disparity is the lack of access in rural areas. A National Rural Roads Development Program \nwas  unveiled  in  2005.  The  rural  roads  development  targets  under  the  11th  Five-Year  Plan \n(11FYP)  includes  paved  road  connection  to  (i) all  townships  and  administrative  villages  in  the \neastern  region,  (ii)  all  townships  and  80%  of  administrative  villages  in  the  central  region,  and \n(iii) 90% of townships and 50% of administrative villages in the western region. In the 11FYP a \ntotal of 900,000 km of rural roads will be constructed or improved. This consists of 500,000 km \nof rural roads to be paved and 400,000 km of new access roads to villages that do not have any \naccess.  The  major  issues  in  implementing  the  11FYP  rural  roads  development  target  are \n(i) inadequate financing; (ii) capacity constraints at county, township, and village levels; (iii) the \nabsence of appropriate design standards for low-volume roads; and (iv) a lack of maintenance. \nAn Asian Development Bank (ADB)-financed technical assistance (TA) project2 has addressed \nthese  issues  and  the  major  recommendations  include  (i)  raising  local  government  revenues \nthrough  a  levy  on  property  tax  and  collecting  a  road  maintenance  fee  from  vehicles  that  are \ncurrently  exempted,  (ii) incorporating  new  class  V  roads  and  village  roads  in  the  highway  law, \n\nRural Roads Development \n\n                                                 \n1   Also  called  the  7918  network,  it  includes  7  expressways  radiating  from  Beijing,  9  north\u2013south  expressways,  and \n\n18 east\u2013west expressways. \n\n2  ADB.  2006.

Accordingly, almost all townships in the eastern region, the \nmore developed parts of the central region, and 70% of townships elsewhere in the central and \nwestern regions, will have at least class V bus terminals, and almost all townships and villages \nwith  road  access  will  have  formal  bus  services.  About  15,000  township  terminals  will  be  built \nunder the 11FYP, with the total subsidy expected to be CNY2.5 billion. \n \n6. \nFreight transport has been deregulated since the mid-1980s, allowing the market to set \nservice standards and freight tariffs. Frequent, regular, and often high-quality services meet the \nneeds  of  most  users  at  affordable  cost.  However,  for  township-to-village  and  village-to-village \nbus  routes  there  are  several  shortcomings,  mostly  related  to  the  strict  regulatory  regime,  the \nmajor  ones  being  (i)  poor  road  conditions  preventing  the  issuance  of  route  license,  (ii)  the \nrequirement of the existence of a township or village bus terminal before transport services can \ncommence,  (iii) extensive licensing restrictions  for operators and routes (iv) restrictions on the \ntype  of  vehicle,  and  (v)  low  commercial  viability.  Under  an  ADB-financed  TA  project,3 these \nissues  have  been  addressed.  The  proposed  recommendations  are  aimed  at  lowering  the \nrestrictions and allowing flexibility in operations, and encouraging local operators to participate.  \n \nD. \n \nRoad  safety  continues  to  be  a  major  issue  in  the  PRC.  The  road-accident  related \n7. \nfatalities  exceeded  100,000  annually \nthe  Ministry  of \nCommunications  launched  the  highway  safety  enhancement  program  (HSEP)  to  address  this \nsituation.  The  HSEP  is  aimed  at  the  adoption  of  best  practices  from  other  countries.  This  has \ninvolved  improvement  in  road  designs,  safety  audits,  removal  of  black  spots,  improved  road \nsignage, and speed control. By 2006, the total number of fatalities was reduced to 89,455 and \nthe number of fatalities per 1,000 vehicles was reduced to 3. However, with the rapid increase in \nthe number of vehicles and improvements in the quality of roads, road safety remains a serious \nproblem.  In  addition  to  implementing  the  HSEP,  the  focus  of  road  safety  activities  have  now \nexpanded to include enforcement of traffic laws and public awareness programs. \n \nE. \n \n8. \nBy the end of 2006, the total road network in Xinjiang was 143,735 km, which included \n541  km  of  expressways,  1,337  km  of  class  I  roads,  7,984  km  of  class  II  roads,  22,688  km  of \nclass  III  roads,  37,373  km  of  class  IV,  and  73,812  km  unclassified  roads.  There  are  eight \nnational  highways  connecting  Xinjiang  with  the  neighboring  provinces  of  Gansu,  Qinghai,  and \nXizang in the east and south, and to the Central Asian countries and Mongolia in the west and \nnorth.  During  the  period  2001\u20132005  (10FYP),  a  total  of  35,319  km  of  new  roads  were \nconstructed. This included 259 km of expressways, 885 km of class I roads, 4,898 km of class II \nroads,  and  29,277  km  of  class  III  and  unclassified  roads.  The  total  investment  in  road \ndevelopment  during  2001\u20132005  was  CNY32.9 billion,  which  was  three  times  the  level  of \n\nXinjiang Road Network and Financing \n\nthe  early  2000s. \n\nRoad Safety \n\nIn  2004, \n\nin \n\n                                                 \n3   ADB.  2006.

The  county  communication  bureaus  are  responsible \nfor local roads in the respective counties. The major sources of maintenance funding are the toll \nrevenues  and  the  road  maintenance  fee.  In  2006,  the  revenue  collected  in  Xinjiang  from  road \nmaintenance fees was CNY2,145 million, and from toll revenues CNY1,388 million. Though the \nrevenues generated for road maintenance are adequate, effective utilization is an issue. Road \nasset management systems were introduced under the World Bank-financed projects4 however, \ntheir application is confined to the higher-class roads. It is the rural roads that suffer most due to \nlack of capacity of the local governments to undertake maintenance. \n \nF. \n \n10. \nADB  has  been  working  with  the  Government  of  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China, \nparticularly  the  Ministry  of  Communications,  to  address  a  variety  of  issues  in  the  road  sector. \nThis effort is supported by the other development partners.

Republic  of  China  (PRC)  has  achieved  unprecedented  rapid \n1. \neconomic progress, development in rural areas has lagged behind, resulting in widening urban-\nrural  income  inequalities.  In  view  of  this  growing  concern,  under  the  11th  Five-Year  Plan \n(11FYP)  the  Government  has  outlined  its  vision  of  \u201cbuilding  a  new  socialist  countryside\u201d  that \ninvolves  accelerated  development  of  rural  infrastructure,  particularly  rural  roads.  Accordingly, \nthe Ministry of Communications (MOC) launched the Rural Roads Construction Program to be \nimplemented  under  the  11FYP.  One  of  the  program  targets  is  that  by  2010  all  townships  and \nvillages in the eastern region, all townships and 80% of villages in the central region, and 90% \nof  townships  and  50%  of  villages  in  the  western  region  will  be  connected  with  a  paved  road \nnetwork.  The  program  also  involves  provision  of  access  to  currently  unserved  villages.  These \ntargets  are  translated  into  rehabilitation  and  upgrading  of  500,000  kilometers  (km)  of  paved \nroads  and  400,000  km  of  access  roads  to  villages.  MOC  plans  to  provide  the  provinces  with \nCNY100 billion for paved roads and CNY40 billion for access roads.  \n \n2. \nDuring the 10FYP period, total investment in rural road construction in Xinjiang province \namounted to CNY5.1 billion, almost seven times the investment during the 9FYP period. Since \n2003,  CNY4.94  billion  has  been  spent  (i)  building  18,588  km  of  rural  roads,  (ii)  making \n1,100 administrative villages accessible by bitumen paved roads, (iii) improving the accessibility \nof 178 townships, and (iv) connecting 410 inaccessible villages by roads, which has benefited \nalmost 3.5 million people. By the end of 2006, the total length of road open to traffic in Xinjiang \nwas 143,735 km, of which classified roads made up 69,923 km (48.6%) and unclassified roads \n73,812 km (51.4%). \n \nB. \n \n3. \nThe  selection  of  road  priorities  is  carried  out  in  accordance  with  the  local  road \nmanagement regulations which set out the requirements for planning of local road development. \nThe Xinjiang Communications Department (XCD) provides the plans and programs for work to \nbe  completed  in  the  following  year.  Funding  for  road  maintenance  is  raised  by  XCD  in \ncollaboration  with  the  local  governments.  Within  the  funding  allocations,  XCD  will  provide \nsubsidies for routine maintenance for county and township roads. The prefecture is responsible \nfor  the  administration  of  construction  and  maintenance  works  and  for  initial  planning  within  its \njurisdiction.  It  prepares  project  proposals  and  provides  information  to  XCD  on  project \nimplementation and execution. The Xinjiang Highways Administration Bureau is responsible for \nthe review of design documentation for projects and acts on behalf of XCD by seeing projects \nthrough to completion.   \n \n4. \nIn general, the selection of local roads for improvement is based upon (i) road condition, \n(ii)  traffic,  (iii)  poverty  in  the  area,  (iv)  access  to  markets  and  social  services  such  as  schools \nand  clinics,  (v)  environmental  impacts,  (vi)  resettlement  considerations,  and  (vii)  location  on \nmajor bus routes.  \n \nC. \n \nThe main objectives of the 11FYP are to (i) extend the road network to unserved areas, \n5. \n(ii)  improve  the  service  level  of  roads,  and  (iii)  provide  all-weather  access.  By  the  end  of  the \n11FYP (2006\u20132010), all townships will have road access, and the percentage of villages having \n\nRural Roads Administration and Planning \n\n11th Five-Year Plan Targets \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 5 \n\n33 \n\nRural Roads Development Program for 2006\u20132007 \n\nroad access will increase from 90% to 99%. Townships having paved roads will increase from \nthe current 66% to 90%. \n \n6. \nDuring  the  11FYP,  60,500  km  of  rural  roads  will  be  rehabilitated  or  constructed  in \nXinjiang at a cost of CNY16.1 billion. Of this, the major rural roads account for 13,300 km with \nan estimated cost of CNY8,600 million, access roads account for 24,900 km with an estimated \ncost of CNY2,900 million, and paved roads to villages account for 22,300 km with an estimated \ncost  of  CNY4,400  million.  A  total  of  50  townships  and  1,600  villages  will  be  connected  with \npaved road. In addition, 2,820 villages will be provided with access roads. \n \nD. \n \nIn  2006,  XCD  constructed  (i)  2,008  km  of  rural  roads  with  MOC  subsidy  of \n7. \nCNY80 million,  (ii)  3,700  km  of  access  roads  with  MOC  subsidy  of  CNY370  million,  and \n(iii) 5,000 km of paved roads to villages with CNY200 million government credit. \n \nIn 2007, XCD plans to develop (i) 109 major rural roads with a total length of 2,306 km \n8. \nand MOC subsidy of CNY800 million, and (ii) 526 access roads with a total length of 5,300 km \nand MOC subsidy of CNY530 million. Each prefecture plans to borrow CNY530 million from the \ngovernment  for  paved  roads  to  villages,  with  a  total  length  of  5,301  km.

The  Xinjiang  Uygur  Autonomous  Region  (or  Xinjiang)  is  located  in \nthe  northwestern  corner  of  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC).  It  has  a  land  area  of \n1,665,000 square  kilometers  (km2),  which  is  one  sixth  of  the  total  area  of  the  PRC,  and  a \npopulation of 20.2 million. It borders eight countries, most of which are members of the Central \nAsia  Regional  Economic  Cooperation  program.  In  2006,  Xinjiang  had  a  total  gross  domestic \nproduct  (GDP)  of  CNY139.9  billion,  an  increase  of  11.1%  compared  to  2004.  Road  transport \ndominates surface transport in Xinjiang, accounting for 82% of the total freight (39% of the total \ntons per km), which is higher than the national average. \n \n2. \nIn  1960,  Xinjiang  had  four  border  posts  with  neighboring  countries  and  a  total  trade \nvolume  of  $13  million.  After  the  collapse  of  the  Soviet  Union  and  the  formation  of  the  new \nCentral Asian republics in the early 1990s, cross-border trade grew rapidly. Currently there are \n15 border ports and the trade volume in 2005 had grown to $5.5 billion (consisting of exports of \n$3.8 billion and imports of $1.7 billion) with an average annual growth rate of 16.3% during the \n2001\u20132005 period. \n \n3. \nDevelopment of Freight Terminals. In line with the growth in cross-border trade and in \nXinjiang\u2019s economy, freight distribution and logistics centers have also expanded significantly in \nUrumqi.  To  accommodate  the  surging  logistics  demand,  the  Ministry  of  Communication  and \nXinjiang Communications Department approved the General Layout of Urumqi Road Transport \nHub  Terminal  Development  Program  in  November  1997  to  construct  14 terminal  facilities  in \nUrumqi.  These  facilities  consist  of  six  passenger  terminals,  six  freight  terminals,  one \nadministration center, and one international passenger and freight terminal. \n \n4. \nOf the freight, administration, and international terminals, so far the administration facility \nand  three  freight  terminals  are  completed;  others  are  under  construction.  There  is  no  special \nfunding  source  for  freight  terminal  development;  the  Xinjiang  Communications  Department  is \nonly responsible for investment in preparatory work, while 90% of the funds for freight terminal \ndevelopment  comes  from  the  private  sector.  There  are  also  freight  terminals  at  each  of  the \nborder  ports;  these  are  usually  simple  storage  yards  developed  by  private  freight  transport \noperators. \n \n5. \nTerminal Efficiency Improvements. The trade volume imbalance between exports and \nimports  and  the  cyclical  pattern  of  agricultural  crop  production  in  Xinjiang  are  some  of  the \nfactors adversely affecting the efficiency of freight terminals and transport operations. According \nto  a  recent  survey, 1  trucks  looking  for  back  loads  wait  10\u201315  days  on  average,  thereby \nincreasing the unit freight cost. Up to 60% of trucks return empty due to lack of information and \ncoordination.  Although  the  terminal  development  program  includes  establishment  of  an \nintegrated transport terminal system by connecting the administration center with the passenger \nand  freight  terminals,  lack  of  funds  prohibits  its  implementation.  The  absence  of  a  logistics \nplatform,  outdated  technology,  and  a  lack  of  management  diminishes  the  efficiency  of  the \nterminal operations. \n \n6. \nThe proposed establishment of an integrated logistics information exchange system with \ninformation  and  communication  technology  under  the  Project  will  improve  the  efficiency  of \nterminal  operation  and  management  and  will  reduce  transportation  logistics  costs.  It  will  give \n\n                                                 \n1   ADB.  2006.

Manila. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 6 \n\n35 \n\nfreight  forwarders  the  ability  to  provide  a  secure  intracity  pick  up  and  delivery  service  to  their \ncustomers in a cost-effective, flexible, and efficient manner. This web-based secure system will \nauthenticate third-party delivery agents and will reduce the costs of intracity pick up and delivery \nfor the transport industry. This system will increase efficiency in the industry by providing road \ntransport  operators  with  real-time  information  to  help  operators  search  for  freight  as  well  as \ngiving  cargo  owners  the  ability  to  not  only  locate  suitable  operators  but  also  to  track  their \nconsignment to the point of delivery, including international destinations. \n \nThe  main  activities  to  achieve  the  goals  are  (i)  implementing  an  web-based  logistics \n7. \ninformation system, and (ii) enhancing capacity development on human resource development \nand  improving  the  efficiency  of  private  sector  operations.  The  first  goal  consists  of  two \nsubcomponents:  (i)  the  facilitation  of  terminal  operation  software,  and  (ii)  improvement  of \nterminal  efficiency  through  the  integration  of  systems  managed  by  terminal  and  logistic \noperators.  The  second  goal  consists  of  the  following  subcomponents:  (i)  human  resource \ndevelopment,  including  training  in  terminal  operation  techniques;  and  (ii) harmonization  and \nsimplification of private sector operational procedures. \n \n8. \nImprovements  in  operational  efficiency  in  individual  terminals  can  generate  substantial \nlong-term  economic  returns  throughout  the  region.  Reduced  distribution  costs  and  improved \nlogistics permit reductions in the cost of products, and provide more reliable access to supplier \nmarkets,  boosting  competitive  opportunities.  The  direct  benefits  from  improved  operational \nefficiency  are  (i)  improved  visibility  over  the  transportation  network;  (ii) increased  vehicle \nutilization, thereby lowering vehicle operating costs; and (iii) increased flow of goods across the \nregion. These integrated terminals may become pivotal points in the regional transport network, \nwhich will create levels and types of employment previously not available in the region, and will \nfacilitate cross-border trade. \n \n9. \nThe  Project  is  proposed  to  provide  (i)  terminal  operation  software,  and  (ii)  2  person-\nmonths of international consultancy assisted by national consultancy to facilitate the information \nexchange  system  and  train  the  Xinjiang  Transport  Administration  Bureau  staff  responsible  for \noperations. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f36 \n\nAppendix 7 \n\nIMPROVING RURAL TRANSPORT SERVICES \n\nRural Transport Issues in Xinjiang \n\n \nA. \n \nUnder  the  11th  Five-Year  Plan  (11FYP),  the  Xinjiang  government  aims  to  establish  a \n1. \nhigh-quality  passenger  transport  service  connecting  the  cities,  townships,  and  villages.  There \nare  currently  485 passenger  terminals  of  different  categories,  including  2  class  I,  29  class  II, \n98 class III, and 98 class IV terminals, and 267 bus stops. However, the findings of a recently \ncompleted ADB-financed technical assistance (TA) project1 indicated that rural access by road \nin Xinjiang is poor. There are as many as 11 townships and 3,036 remote administrative villages \nthat  are  inaccessible  by  regular  bus  services,  where  rural  travelers  rely  on  motorized  three-\nwheeled vehicles, agricultural tractors, and animal-powered vehicles. This is primarily due to the \nregion\u2019s vast area, sparse population, and underdeveloped economy, and the high construction \nand  maintenance  costs  of  rural  roads.  Where  public  transport  services  are  available,  they  are \noften  inefficient  and  unsafe.  Public  transport  efficiency  in  Kuqa  county,  where  the  Project  is \nlocated, is very low in terms of the average length of service per bus per day. This results in a \nlong wait for passengers at bus stations and an inability to rotate buses onto other routes. There \nis a need to extend bus services to remote townships and villages as well as to reduce the cost \nof providing services by improving vehicle efficiency and providing more frequent services.  \n \nB. \n \n2. \nmentioned TA project suggests that \n \n\nInternational good practice in rural transport services based on the findings of the above-\n\nInternational Good Practice \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nuncontrolled  competition  should  be  avoided;  instead,  operators  should  be \neducated in basic principles and a regulatory framework should be applied; \na flexible approach to regulatory control should be maintained if costs are to be \nminimized  and  any  subsidies  are  to  be  cost  effective;  operators  should  be \nallowed the freedom to tailor their services to meet the needs of users; \nthe  regulations  should  not  stifle  initiative,  such  as  the  use  of  unconventional \nvehicles or variations in quality and capacity in response to demand; \nrather  than  being  consolidated  into  larger  companies,  localized  services  should \nbe  encouraged  to  play  a  greater  role  in  meeting  local  needs\u2014their  costs  are \nlower and they are more aware of the community\u2019s requirements; and \nterminals  are  not  always  necessary  to  achieve  safe  boarding  and  alighting  of \npassengers and interchange between routes. \n\n \n3. \nThe  TA  project  has  recommended  reforms  to  improve  the  provision  of  road  passenger \ntransport services to rural areas in the People\u2019s Republic of China. These involve (i) changes in \nthe definition, licensing, and regulation of rural buses, rural bus routes, rural bus operators, and \nrural bus terminals to encourage more demand-responsive, township-based operators and give \nthem  the  freedom  and  flexibility  to  offer  services  that  are  efficient  and  better  capable  of \nresponding to users\u2019 needs; and (ii) corresponding measures to clarify the role and strengthen \nthe  capacity  of  county-level  road  transport  administrations  in  relation  to  the  recommended \nregulatory changes. \n \n \n\n                                                 \n1   ADB.  2006.

Accordingly, the following pilot reforms were developed. \n \n5. \nObjectives  and  Overview.  The  bus  route  licensing  reforms  in  Kuqa  county  will  be \ndemonstrated,  tested,  monitored,  and  adjusted  to  ensure  that  they  are  workable  before  being \nextended  throughout  Xinjiang.  The  pilot  reform  will  involve  the  establishment  of  at  least  one \nvillage bus operator to operate a number of village bus routes, and will provide \n \n \n \n\na demonstration of how the proposed reforms to village bus services will operate; \nan  opportunity  to  involve  all  stakeholders  in  designing  and  monitoring  the \neffectiveness of the village bus service system; \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n\n(iii)  model drafts of all documents and procedures needed to plan, license, operate, \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nand monitor operations under the recommended system; \nthe training plans and materials needed to establish and maintain the necessary \nplanning  and  regulatory  skills  in  the  county-level  road  transport  administration \nand  appropriate  management,  planning,  and  operational  skills  in  the  chosen \nvillage bus operator; and \nan  opportunity  to  identify  any  problems  and  shortcomings,  and  to  adjust  the \nproposed arrangements based on the practical experience. \n\n \nThe  holder  of  the  village  bus  route  license(s)  will  be  a  local  company  or  cooperative \n6. \nformed perhaps by local bus and minibus owners who previously worked as subcontractors for \na  larger  company.  The  pilot  project  will  assist  with  the  formation  of  this  group  and  provide \ntraining for the new operators in basic management techniques, bus service management, and \nsafety, as well as training for the staff of a village bus division to be established in the county \nroad transport administration. \n \n7. \n \n \n\nKey Activities. The main activities will include \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nhelping to establish a project implementation group, chaired by the Kuqa county \ncommunications bureau, to oversee the reform activities; \nbriefings  and  consultations  with  all  parties  affected,  including  existing  bus  and \ntaxi operators, informal operators, local business groups, local leaders, and their \ncommunities; \ndrafting  the  necessary  decrees  and  dispensations  to  enable  the  pilot  reform  to \nproceed  and  to  authorize  the  participation  of  the  public  sector  stakeholders \nconcerned; \nselecting  a  suitable  local  group  to  operate  as  village  bus  operator,  and  briefing \nthem  on  the  proposals,  helping  to  carry  out  demand  surveys,  and  providing \ntraining and simple management tools; \nin  consultation  with  operators,  selecting  the  routes  to  be  included  in  the  village \nbus  route  network,  and  defining  stopping  places  and  minimum  service \nfrequencies as necessary; \ndrafting the village bus route license conditions based on the proposals of the TA \nproject,  and  helping  to  get  temporary  licenses  issued  to  the  group  chosen  to \noperate the route(s); \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f38 \n\nAppendix 7 \n\n(vii) \n\ndrafting  the  conditions  for  a  village  bus  license,  and  helping  to  get  temporary \nlicenses  issued  to  the  vehicle  owners  who  wish  to  join  the  group  holding  the \nvillage bus route license(s); \n\n(viii)  clarifying the role and procedures of the communications bureau in relation to the \nvillage  bus  services,  including  (a)  planning  and  designing  village  routes; \n(b) canvassing for interest from potential groups and helping with the formation of \nvillage  bus  operators;  (c)  setting  conditions  for  village  bus  route  licenses; \n(d) calling  for  and  evaluating  proposals  for  village  bus  route  licenses  (and  bids \nwhere there are competing potential operators); (d) administering the village bus, \nvillage bus route, and village bus operator licensing system, including supervision \nand inspection arrangements designed to secure public safety and the interests \nof  users,  operators,  and  the  general  public;  (e)  adjusting  route  structures  and \noperations,  if  necessary;  and  (f)  monitoring  operations  to  ensure  that  the \nobjectives of the pilot project are met; and \nevaluating  the  results  of  the  pilot  reform,  circulating  these  for  discussion  to \ncounty  and  provincial  communication  bureaus,  and  drafting  detailed  guidelines \nto  enable \nand  draft  amendment \nimplementation throughout Xinjiang. \n\nregulations  and  decrees \n\nto  existing \n\n(ix) \n\n \n8. \nImplementation  Arrangements.  Two  rural  transport  specialists\u2014one  international \n(4 person-months)  and  one  national  (8  person-months)\u2014will  be  recruited  under  consulting \nservices  contracts  to  carry  out  the  tasks  described  in  the  above  key  activities.  The  Xinjiang \nCommunications Construction Administration Bureau will be the Implementing Agency and the \nday-to-day  management  of  the  pilot  reform  will  be  the  responsibility  of  the  Kuqa  county \ncommunications bureau. Overall direction will be given by a project director. \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 8 \n\n39 \n\nROAD SAFETY IMPROVEMENT \n\nIssues \n\n \nA. \n \nRapid  economic  development  accompanied  by  increasing  vehicular  growth  in  Xinjiang \n1. \nhas  resulted  in  rising  level  of  traffic,  increased  pressure  on  the  road  system,  a  substantial \nnumber  of  road  accidents,  and  large  loss  of  life.  During  the  period  1996\u20132005,  over \n25,000 people  were  killed  and  over  75,000  people  injured  in  road  traffic  accidents.  Fatalities \nhave increased from 1,863 in 1996 to 2,491 in 2000, and to 2,588 in 2006 (Table A8). In 2006, \nthe  estimated  economic  losses  from  road  accidents  and  fatalities  in  Xinjiang  exceeded \nCNY 16.63 million. \n \n\nItem \n\nFatalities \nInjuries \n\nTable A8: Road Accidents in Xinjiang (2000\u20132005) \n2002 \n2000 \n\n2001 \n\n2003 \n\n2004 \n\n2005 \n\n2006 \n\n2,491 \n7,976 \n\n2,539 \n9,295 \n\n2,563 \n9,199 \n\n2,643 \n10,044 \n\n2,892 \n8,918 \n\n3,111 \n10,437 \n\n2,588 \n8,843 \n\nSource: Statistical Year Book (2006). \n\n \n2. \nThe  total  number  of  vehicles  owned  in  Xinjiang  in  2006  was  717,370  with  an  annual \nincrease  of 20.3%.  Based  on  the  total  population  of  20.2 million  in 2005  with  a  growth  rate  of \n2.40%,  the  fatality  rate  in  Xinjiang  was  22  per  10,000  vehicles  and  15  per  100,000  people, \nwhich is higher than the national average. \n \n3. \nOn the existing Korla\u2013Kuqa expressway, in 2005 65% of deaths and 62% of accidents \noccurred in rear-end collisions. A common factor in rear-end accidents has been the inability of \nthe driver of the rear vehicle to see or accurately determine traffic conditions ahead (degraded \nperception). Harsh  weather  conditions  like  snow,  fog,  rain,  and  ice  clearly  increase  the  risk  of \nrear-end  collisions  during  long  winters  when  the  average  temperature  falls  to  \u201312\u00b0 celsius  (C) \nand can go down to as much as \u201330\u00b0 C. The risk of traffic accidents and breakdown of vehicles \nis strongly related to this harsh weather. The risk can be reduced by providing necessary and \ntimely information to drivers.  \n \nThe  fatality  rate  on  class  I  highways  in  Xinjiang  is  37.5%  higher  than  on  class  II \n4. \nhighways.  Similarly,  when  rural  roads  are  upgraded,  the  increased  traffic  accidents  mainly \ninvolve pedestrians or users of nonmotorized transport and public buses. Local people need to \nbe  aware  that  traffic  will  be  moving  faster  and  the  volume  of  traffic  will  increase  when  local \nroads  are  improved.  Therefore,  there  is  a  need  to  increase  awareness  of  the  rural  population \nabout road improvement and increasing vehicle speeds to minimize any negative impact of road \ndevelopment.  \n \nB. \n \nThe  road  safety  improvement  component  includes  (i)  conducting  a  safety  audit  for  the \n5. \nthe  expressway, \nproject  roads,  (ii)  developing  an  action  plan \n(iii) institutional  capacity  development  of  the  Xinjiang  Communications  Department  and \nincreasing  public  awareness  in  road  safety,  and  (iv)  utilizing  information  technology  for  road \nsafety and the installation of traffic safety devices along the project roads. \n \n6. \nRoad Safety Audit and Action Plan. For the Korla\u2013Kuqa expressway, the safety audits \nwill  be  undertaken  at  the  detailed  design  and  pre-opening  stages,  and  for  local  roads  at  the \n\nRoad Safety Improvement \n\nfor  safe  operation  of \n\n \n\n\f40 \n\nAppendix 8 \n\ndetailed design stage. The consultants to be engaged under the Project will develop an action \nplan to ensure safe operation of the expressway. \n \n7. \nInstitutional  Capacity  Development  and  Public  Awareness.  As  part  of  institutional \ncapacity development and to increase public awareness, the following activities will be carried \nout:  \n \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n\ncapacity development on design, safety audit, and maintenance for safety; \ncapacity development on enforcement of traffic law; and \ncommunity awareness (community-based road safety program). \n\n \n8. \nThis  subcomponent  will  be  executed  through  partnership  between  the  Xinjiang \nCommunications  Construction  Administration  Bureau,  the  Xinjiang  Public  Security  Bureau \n(PSB), local governments of Korla, Luntai, and Kuqa, and other stakeholders.  \n \nUnder  an  Asian  Development  Bank-financed  technical  assistance  project 1  in  the \n9. \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China and jointly undertaken with the Ministry of Public Security, a number \nof  training  opportunities  are  offered  to  the  provincial  PSB.  The  training  involves  (i)  traffic \nenforcement,  (ii)  accident  investigation,  (iii)  accident  data  and  publicity,  and  (iv) driver\u2019s \nlicensing  examiner  issues.  The  training  is  planned  to  take  place  during  2007  and  2008  at  the \nTraffic  Management  Research  Institute  of  the  Ministry  of  Public  Security  in  Wuxi  city.  Various \nroad safety audit, black-spot treatment, publicity, and enforcement materials and guidelines will \nbe provided to the traffic police and communications departments. Selected traffic police officers \nfrom Xinjiang PSB will also benefit from this training. \n \nUtilizing Information Technology for Road Safety. The Intelligent Transport Systems2 \n10. \nwill  be  introduced  for  the  project  expressway  and  will  provide  a  traffic  surveillance  monitoring \nsystem  to  alert  drivers  and  prevent  rear-end  collisions.  The  traffic  surveillance  system  will \nmonitor  traffic  and  road  conditions  and  send  real-time  information  and/or  messages  to  road \nusers to alert them to foreseen snow, rain, ice, and traffic. Speed warning systems will be also \ninstalled to make drivers aware of their speed. \n \n\n                                                 \n1   ADB. 2006.

The  length  of  high-grade \nhighway within Xinjiang is more than 1,000 kilometers (km), and the number of staff engaged in \nthe  high-grade  highway  work  is  also  being  increased.  XCD  staff  have  received  training  under \nthree World Bank projects.1 Training mainly focused on (i) strengthening XCD and its jurisdiction \nunits, and (ii) training XCD staff to satisfy the needs for construction and management of high-\ngrade highways in Xinjiang. Training programs in more than 20 different fields were conducted \nin Xinjiang, in other parts of the People\u2019s Republic of China, and abroad. By training abroad, the \ntrainees learned  about current  development  policies,  advanced  technologies,  and  construction \nmanagement  experiences  of  high-grade  highways  and  expressways  in  foreign  developed \ncountries.  \n \n2. \nAfter  detailed  analysis  of  what  has  been  done  in  the  past  and  what  results  XCD  had \nobtained  from  previous  training,  the  training  plans  (both  overseas  and  in-country)  to  be \nimplemented under the Project were developed (Tables A9.1 and A9.2). The purpose of these \nplans  is  to  further  strengthen  organizational  capability  and  improve  staff  quality  and  work \nefficiency  to  improve  the  entire  technological  and  management  level  of  highway  sectors  in \nXinjiang.  These  plans  are  proposed  to  commence  in  2008  and  be  completed  in  2011.  The \nestimated training cost is $710,000, of which about $700,000 is for international and $10,000 is \nfor  in-country  training.

The  analysis  is  based  on  the  actual  and  forecast  data  on  traffic  volume, \nvehicle operating costs, user\u2019s time savings, reduction in accident costs, and economic project \ncost.  The  economic  analysis  includes  (i)  the  Korla\u2013Kuqa  expressway  (296.5  kilometers  [km]), \nand (ii) three local roads in Qiemo and Kuqa counties (193 km). The parameter values used in \nthe economic analysis include (i) a discount rate of 12%, (ii) a 20-year period after construction \n(4 years  for  the  expressway  and  3  years  for  the  local  roads),  (iii)  a  shadow  exchange  rate \nconversion  factor  of  1.03,  (iv)  an  economic  conversion  factor  of  0.67  for  local  unskilled  labor, \nand (v) 50% of the construction cost as the residual value for the project roads. \n \n2. \nTraffic Projections. A summary of the average daily traffic projections based on recent \ndata  is  presented  in  Table  A13.1.  The  current  average  daily  traffic  volume  on  the  national \nhighway  is  in  the  range  of  2,700\u20133,100  vehicles  (5,200\u20136,100  passenger  car  units)  per  day, \nconsisting of about 52% to 55% of trucks and 45% to 48% passenger vehicles (cars and buses). \nThe  projections  are  based  on  a  10-year  analysis  of  economic  output,  population  growth,  and \ngrowth in passenger and/or freight traffic. The traffic growth rates will remain at 8% in the short \nterm, and will decline over the medium to long term as economic growth and investment in the \nregion reaches maturity. These traffic growth rates have been applied to the traffic volume data \ncollected in August 2006, and used to forecast annual average daily traffic volumes from 2010 \nto 2030 with 5-year intervals. \n \n\nTable A13.1: Summary of Traffic Forecast for the Project \n(passenger car unit) \n\nItem \nA.

The  upgrading  of  the  existing  highway  to  a  tolled  expressway  has  been \ndetermined  to  be  economically  viable  at  a  12%  discount  rate.  The  expressway  economic \ninternal rate of return (EIRR) is estimated at 20.0% and the net present value (NPV) of project \nbenefits at CNY3.6 billion. \n \n4. \nAs  a  proportion  of  the  project\u2019s  total  benefit,  normal  traffic  benefits  included  (i)  vehicle \noperating cost benefits (70.4%, CNY6,472.8 million), (ii) generated traffic benefits as a total of \nall  benefit  categories \n(0.8%, \nCNY69.2 million), and (iv) time saving benefits (5.2%, CNY479.6 million). \n\n(23.6%,  CNY2,168.9  million), \n\n(iii)  accident  savings \n\n \n\n\f48 \n\nAppendix 13 \n\nSensitivity  Analysis  of  Expressway.  A  series  of  sensitivity  tests  was  undertaken \n5. \nbased  on  the  following considerations:  (i)  construction  costs  increase by  10.0%  of  base  traffic \ngrowth levels; (ii) construction costs increase by 20.0% of base traffic growth levels; (iii) benefit \ngrowth  reduces  by  10.0%  of  base  construction  costs;  (iv)  benefit  growth  reduces  by  20.0%  of \nbase construction costs; (v) road maintenance costs increase by 10.0%; (vi) appreciation of the \nyuan by 20.0%; (vii) a combination of i and iii; (viii) a delay in construction by 1 year, and (ix) a \nworst-case scenario (i+iv+v+vi). \n \nThe sensitivity analysis results show that the project remains economically viable under \n6. \nadverse scenarios tested. The economic viability is considered to be quite robust as the EIRR \nvalues  are  well  above  12.0%  in  the  sensitivity  analysis  cases.  The  results  presented  indicate \nthat in a worst-case scenario situation (which is very unlikely to occur) the Project would return \nan  EIRR  of  13.8%.  In  addition  to  these  tests,  the  switching  values  for  construction  costs  and \ntraffic  growth  for  each  option  were  calculated.  The  results  suggest  that  costs  would  need  to \nincrease  by  97.9%  to  reduce  the  EIRR  to  12%,  while  benefits  would  need  to  be  reduced  by \n47.5% to reduce the EIRR to the same level. \n  \n7. \nLocal  Roads.  The  economic  evaluation  of the  proposal  to  rehabilitate  193 km  of  three \nlocal  roads  has  been  determined  to  be  economically  viable  at  a  12%  discount  rate.  The  local \nroad\u2019s EIRR was estimated at 35.0%1 and the NPV at CNY413.2 million. \n \n8. \nSensitivity  Analysis  of  Local  Roads.  The  sensitivity  analysis  was  undertaken  based \non  the  risks  listed  in  para.  5.  All  these  risks  were  analyzed  through  sensitivity  tests  and  the \nevaluation  results  were  found  to  be  robust  for  all  of  them.  For  the  project  component  to  be \nunacceptable (i.e., an EIRR lower than 12% or a zero NPV at 12% discount rate), the benefits \nwould have to fall by less than 79.9% of those in the base case with no change in costs, or the \ncosts would have to increase to more than 235.4% of the base costs. The EIRR under a worst-\ncase scenario is 19.7%. \n \n9. \nOverall  Economic  Evaluation.  The  overall  EIRR  of  the  project,  including  the \nexpressway and the local roads, is 20.5% with an NPV of CNY4.0 billion at a 12% discount rate. \nThe  details  of  the  overall  cost  and  benefit  stream  are  presented  in  Table  A13.2,  and  are \nsummarized in Table A13.3. \n\n                                                 \n1 The  EIRR  is  estimated  at  39.6%  for  the  Wuqia\u2013Dunkuotan  township  road,  at  45.4%  for  the  New  Long  March \n\nBridge\u2013Aqiang township road, and at 32.6% for the Suntang Maintenance Office\u2013Aoyiyalake township road. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 13 \n\n49 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\nProject Economic Cost \n\n \nMaintenance \n\nProject Economic Benefits \n \nTotal \n\n \nTable A13.2: Summary of Economic Analysis of Consolidated Projects \n(CNY10,000) \n \n \nLocal \n  Expressway  Road \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nTotal \nCost \n101,956 \n127,833 \n167,705 \n43,151 \n1,654 \n1,654 \n1,654 \n1,654 \n1,654 \n2,757 \n1,654 \n12,419 \n12,419 \n1,654 \n1,654 \n1,654 \n1,654 \n1,654 \n1,654 \n2,757 \n6,820 \n12,326 \n(185,175) \nNet Present Value at 12%: \nEconomic Internal Rate of Return: \n\n0 \n0 \n1,432 \n1,432 \n53,852 \n1,942 \n62,534 \n2,603 \n72,674 \n3,468 \n84,544 \n4,610 \n6,126 \n98,472 \n8,148  109,966 \n10,858  123,142 \n11,437  135,288 \n12,046  148,683 \n12,688  163,463 \n13,363  177,739 \n14,076  193,309 \n14,688  210,155 \n15,325  228,535 \n15,989  248,595 \n16,681  271,082 \n17,402  295,680 \n18,155  322,593 \n18,941  352,047 \n18,941  383,468 \n51,706  784,374 \n \n\n \nLAR \n12,464  \n0  \n0  \n0  \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0  \n\n0  \n93  \n93  \n1,654  \n1,654 \n1,654 \n1,654 \n1,654 \n1,654 \n2,757 \n1,654 \n12,419 \n12,419 \n1,654 \n1,654 \n1,654 \n1,654 \n1,654 \n1,654 \n2,757 \n12,326 \n12,326 \n1,561 \n\n51,911 \n59,931 \n69,206 \n79,934 \n92,346 \n101,818 \n112,284 \n123,850 \n136,637 \n150,776 \n164,375 \n179,232 \n195,466 \n213,209 \n232,605 \n254,401 \n278,278 \n304,438 \n333,106 \n364,527 \n732,668 \n\nCapital \nCost \n89,492  \n127,740  \n167,613  \n41,497  \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n(5,506) \n0 \n(186,737) \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\nNet \n\n  Project \n \n  Benefit \n \n(131,920)\n \n(135,741)\n \n(153,246)\n \n8,818 \n \n60,880 \n \n71,020 \n \n82,890 \n \n96,818 \n \n108,312 \n \n120,385 \n \n133,634 \n \n136,265 \n \n151,045 \n \n176,085 \n \n191,655 \n \n208,501 \n \n226,881 \n \n246,941 \n \n269,428 \n \n292,923 \n \n315,774 \n \n339,722 \n \n568,643 \n  402,493 \n20.5% \n \n\n \n \n( ) = negative, LAR = Land Acquisition and Resettlement. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n\nTable A13.3: Overall Economic Evaluation \n\nProject Component \nKorla\u2013Kuqa Expressway  \nLocal Roads  \nConsolidated investment \n\nEIRR (%) \n20.0 \n35.0 \n20.5 \n\nNPV (CNY million at 12%) \n3,623.6 \n413.2 \n4,024.9 \n\nEIRR = economic internal rate of return, NPV = net present value. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n \n10. \nDistribution  Analysis.

Sensitivity tests were conducted by varying \nthe project costs, traffic volumes, toll rates, and a combination of these factors.  \n \nB. \n \n2. \nThe  FIRR  calculations  are  in  constant  2007  prices,  covering  about  4  years  of \nconstruction  and  20  years  of  operation.  The  total  project  capital  cost  was  estimated  to  be \n$594.00  million  (CNY4,514.5  million),2 which  covers  the  costs  for  civil  works,  equipment,  land \nacquisition and resettlement, consulting services, trainings, project administration, physical and \nprice contingency, and interest during construction. \n \n3. \nThe  forecast  of  future  traffic  on  the  Korla\u2013Kuqa  expressway  is  based  on  the  feasibility \nstudy  and  latest  traffic  survey  carried  out  during  project  preparation.  The  forecast  traffic  was \nconverted  into  the  annual  average  daily  traffic  by  vehicle  type,  which  is  consistent  with  the \ncurrent expressway tolling system in Xinjiang. The forecast traffic indicates that the traffic level \non the project expressway will initially be low but will increase over the evaluation period. The \nproject expressway will be open for regular traffic in mid-2011. \n \n4. \nXinjiang  is  applying  uniform  toll  rates  to  all  expressways  in  accordance  with  provincial \ngovernment  policy.  These  toll  rates  are  given  in  Table  A14.1.  The  toll  rates  were  developed \naccording to the Xinjiang government toll road policies and by considering the construction cost, \nroad  user  affordability,  loan  repayment  and  neighboring  province  toll  rates.  Based  on  the \nexisting toll rates, the estimated weighted average toll collection per passenger car unit would \nbe  CNY50  for  the  Korla\u2013Luntai  section  and  CNY30  for  the  Kuqa\u2013Luntai  section.  For  the \npurpose of the FIRR calculation, these toll rates were held constant throughout the calculation \nperiod.  \n \n\nTable A14.1: Toll Rates Based on Vehicle Classifications(CNY per vehicle-km) \n\nVehicle Type \n\n \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\nTrucks < 2 tons \nTrucks > 2 tons < 5 tons \nTrucks > 5 tons < 10 tons \nTrucks > 10 tons < 15 tons \nTrucks > 15 tons \nPassenger vehicles < 7 seats \nPassenger vehicles > 8 seats < 19 seats \nPassenger vehicles > 20 seats < 39 seats \nPassenger vehicle > 40 seats \n\nFactor \n1 \n1.5 \n2 \n3.6 \n4.2 \n1 \n1.5 \n2 \n3.6 \n\nRates \n0.25\u20130.30 \n0.38\u20130.45 \n0.50\u20130.60 \n0.90\u20131.08 \n1.05\u20131.26 \n0.25\u20130.30 \n0,38\u20130.45 \n0.50\u20130.60 \n0.90\u20131.08 \n\n \n \n5. \nThe routine and periodic maintenance costs estimate were based on maintenance cost \nfor other similar expressways in Xinjiang Province. Routine maintenance cost was estimated at \nCNY50,000  per  kilometer  per  year,  which  covers  road  cleaning,  landscaping,  minor  road \nsurface repair, traffic sign maintenance and replacement, and expressway facility maintenance. \n\n                                                 \n1   ADB. 2005.

Manila. \n2   The exchange  rate used in this analysis is  $1.00 = CNY7.60  which prevailed at the time  of loan appraisal of the \n\nProject. \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 14 \n\n51\n\n \n\nThe periodical maintenance is required every 8 years and was estimated at CNY1.00 million per \nkilometer. \n \n6. \nTwo types of taxes were considered in the financial evaluation: business tax of 5.5% on \ngross  revenue  and  corporate  income  tax  of  33%  of  net  profit  according  to  the  national  and \nprovincial taxation law. The FIRR was calculated with and without the corporate income taxes \n(before and after corporate income tax). Corporate income taxes were calculated using constant \nprices for both costs and toll revenues, after deducting depreciation expenses and interests. \n \nC. \n \n \n \nA critical element of financial analysis is to determine whether the FIRR is at least equal \n7. \nto the weighted average cost of capital (WACC). The project WACC was calculated in line with \nADB guidelines. The 5-year fixed swap rate plus a provision for ADB\u2019s spread of 0.6% is used \nas  the  cost  of  ADB  financing.  The  cost  of  equity  was  assumed  to  be  8%  and  the  estimated \ninterest cost of the domestic loan is 6.39%.

All calculations are made \nin  2007  prices.  The  calculated  FIRR  is  5.06%  after  tax.  The  cash  flows  are  shown  in  Table \nA14.3.  The  FIRR  after  tax  is  higher  than  the  WACC  (3.21%)  and  therefore  the  project  is \nconsidered financially viable. The FIRR of the Korla\u2013Kuqa expressway is similar to the FIRRs of \nother ADB-financed expressway projects in the People\u2019s Republic of China.  \n\n \n\n\f52 \n\n \n\nAppendix 14 \n\nTable A14.3: Financial Evaluation of the Project (CNY million) \n\n \n \nCapital \n\n \n \nO&M \n\n \n \nTotal \n\nInvestment  Cost  Outflow  Revenue \n\n \n \n \n\n\u2014 \n\u2014 \n\u2014 \n116 \n250 \n272 \n294 \n317 \n335 \n356 \n378 \n402 \n427 \n448 \n469 \n493 \n515 \n540 \n568 \n595 \n624 \n654 \n687 \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\nRevenue \nAfter \nBusiness  Business  Corporate \nTax \n\u2014 \n\u2014 \n\u2014 \n110 \n236 \n257 \n277 \n300 \n316 \n336 \n357 \n379 \n403 \n423 \n443 \n466 \n487 \n510 \n536 \n562 \n589 \n618 \n649 \n\nTax \n\u2014 \n\u2014 \n\u2014 \n- \n- \n- \n2 \n9 \n14 \n30 \n36 \n48 \n57 \n78 \n83 \n88 \n98 \n109 \n121 \n126 \n144 \n154 \n159 \n\nTax \n\u2014 \n\u2014 \n\u2014 \n6 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n30 \n31 \n33 \n34 \n36 \n38 \n\nNet \nInflow \n(After \nTax) \n\u2014 \n\u2014 \n\u2014 \n110 \n236 \n257 \n275 \n290 \n302 \n306 \n321 \n331 \n346 \n345 \n360 \n378 \n388 \n401 \n416 \n437 \n446 \n463 \n490 \n\n \n\n \n \nNet Free \nCashflow \n(783) \n(1,175) \n(1,567) \n(292) \n211 \n231 \n249 \n263 \n274 \n277 \n291 \n152 \n166 \n312 \n327 \n343 \n353 \n365 \n378 \n398 \n258 \n274 \n2,406 \n906 \n5.06% \n\n783 \n1,175 \n1,567 \n392 \n\u2014 \n\u2014 \n\u2014 \n\u2014 \n\u2014 \n\u2014 \n\u2014 \n148 \n148 \n\u2014 \n\u2014 \n\u2014 \n\u2014 \n\u2014 \n\u2014 \n\u2014 \n148 \n148 \n(1,958) \n\n\u2014 \n\u2014 \n\u2014 \n10 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \n32 \n33 \n34 \n35 \n35 \n36 \n38 \n39 \n40 \n41 \n42 \n3.21% \n \n\n783 \n1,175 \n1,567 \n401 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n179 \n180 \n33 \n34 \n35 \n35 \n36 \n38 \n39 \n188 \n189 \n(1,916) \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n3. \n\nWACC \n\nNPV \nFIRR \n\nSensitivity Tests \n\n \n \n( ) = negative, FIRR = financial internal rate of return, NPV = net present value, O&M = operation and maintenance, \nWACC = weighted average cost of capital. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n \n \nSensitivities  on  the  FIRR  were  tested  considering  an  increase  or  decrease  in  the \n9. \nproject\u2019s capital cost, operation and maintenance cost, expressway revenue, and combinations \nof these assumptions.

However, even if the capital cost is \nincreased by 20%, the projected FIRR is higher than the WACC. If the traffic volumes decrease \nby 21.4%, the FIRR will be on a par with the WACC. Similarly, if the capital cost increases by \n29.1%,  the  FIRR  will  be  on  a  par  with  the  WACC.

A  set  of  financial  indicators  was  also  derived  from  these  financial  statements. \nThese financial statements and indicators are shown in Tables A14.5, A14.6, and A14.7. \n \n11. \nAn  income  statement  was  prepared  for  the  project  expressway,  in  which  the  operation \nrevenue was calculated using expressway toll revenue and other revenues. The net operation \nrevenue  was  calculated  by  deducting  business  tax  (5.5%)  from  total  operation  revenue.  The \ntotal  operation  expenses  were  calculated  by  summarizing  operation  expenses,  maintenance \nexpenses,  and  asset  depreciation.  The  net  incomes  were  calculated  for  before  and  after \ncorporate income tax (33% of the operation income). According to the projection, the revenues \nare adequate to cover the operation and maintenance cost and loan repayments.  \n \n12. \nThe  net  income  is  negative  in  the  first  4  years  of  expressway  formal  operation  due  to \nhigh depreciation costs and high bank loan interest payments. From the 5th year onwards, the \nincome statement shows a healthy net income and operating ratio. In the cash flow projections, \nthe cash inflows comprise project financing and net operation incomes; cash outflows comprise \nproject construction expenses and bank loan principle repayments. Projections show a positive \ncash flow throughout the operation. \n \n13. \nThese calculations confirm that the Korla\u2013Kuqa expressway is a financially viable project \nand will have sufficient funds for its operations, maintenance, and repayment of borrowings by \nthe implementation agency.

analysis?    (cid:133)  No \n \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC): \n \nThe  Project  was  developed  in  a  participatory  manner  and  to  plan  sustainable  transport  improvements  which  lead  to \neconomic  development  in  a  more  socially  inclusive  manner  in  the  project  area.  The  Project  involves  (i)  the \nconstruction of a 296.5 kilometer (km) expressway between Korla city in the Bayangol Mongol Autonomous Prefecture \nand Kuqa county in the Aksu administrative office, (ii) the upgrade of a 30-km local road in Kuqa county, and (iii) the \nupgrade of two local roads (166 km) in Qiemo county of the Bayangol Mongol Autonomous Prefecture. The local road \nimprovements  are  designed  to  link  poor  townships  to  the  counties.  Another  important  component  for  local \ncommunities is improvement in rural transport services and road safety. \n \nB. \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed? \n \nThe main strategy for poverty reduction in the project area has been diversification into cash crops, and urbanization \nsupported  by  growth  in  the  energy  sector.  The  project  expressway  and  local  roads  will  support  this  strategy  by \nimproving the local transport network,  which reduces the travel costs and times to Urumqi. The Project enforces the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  road  sector  operational  strategy  for  the  PRC  by  removing  infrastructure  constraints \nand  supporting  policy  and  institutional  reforms.  The  Project  is  in  line  with  the  Government\u2019s  western  region \ndevelopment strategy to provide the poor western region with better infrastructure to address its remoteness, thereby \ncreating  conditions  necessary  for  improving  the  investment  environment  and  people\u2019s  living  conditions.  Despite \nconsiderable  investments,  the  road  network  in  the  project  area  is  still  inadequate  and  does  not  provide  efficient \ntransport access to markets and social services such as education and health. The quality of access to many villages \nremains unsatisfactory, with low-standard and poorly maintained roads. Between villages and townships, small buses \noperate, but travel is mostly by small trucks, 3-wheeled vehicles, or horse-drawn carts. Local road improvements and \nprovision  of  better  bus  services  to  these  communities  are  vital  elements  in  ensuring  an  affordable  rural  transport \nsystem, due to low rates of vehicle ownership. \n \nThe  poverty  analysis  demonstrates  how  the  Project  overall  will  have  a  significant  impact  on  the  rural  poor.  Relative \npoverty (which is defined as people  with a per capita income of less than CNY1,200) in the project area constitutes \n16.6% of the rural population (about 100,000 persons). Most of the poor are ethnic Uygur. The poverty analysis shows \nthat, in areas where the local roads and transport services are improved, the Project will have significant impacts on \nrural  people,  including  improved  access  to  education,  health,  and  markets.  The  benefits  to  the  poor  will  increase \nfurther if agricultural productivity can be improved.  \n \nC. \nIs there a stakeholder analysis?                     (cid:59)  Yes             (cid:133)   No \n \nThe  stakeholder  analysis  is  described  in  the  social  and  poverty  analysis,  and  the  recommendations  of  stakeholders \nhave  been  incorporated  into  the  ethnic  minority  development  plans  (EMDPs).  The  analysis  revealed  that  all \ngovernment  stakeholders  (transport,  agriculture,  poverty  alleviation  development  office,  ethnic  minorities,  education, \ntourism,  and  water  resources)  support  the  Project  because  it  will  facilitate  overall  economic  development.  Some  of \nthese agencies (poverty alleviation development office, ethnic minorities, and agriculture) believe the Project will also \ngreatly  assist  with  sustainable  poverty  reduction.  Village-level  perceptions  were  somewhat  different.  Nonpoor  Uygur \nmen  and  women  and  all  non-Uygur  people  support  the  Project  because  they  argue  it  will  facilitate  overall  economic \ndevelopment. However, only nonpoor Uygur males believe the Project will assist in sustainable poverty reduction. All \nrural stakeholders considered the Project will improve access to education and healthcare, and poor females think the \nProject could contribute to greater gender empowerment. The private sector had a mixed response because improved \naccess and lower transport costs may attract new competitors. Larger, more export-oriented companies welcome the \nProject, as does the tourism sector. \n \nIs there a participation strategy?                  (cid:59)  Yes               (cid:133)   No \n \nThe road construction, the resettlement plans and the EMDPs will follow a consultative approach and will encourage \ncollaboration  with  local  communities  during  implementation.  Village  leaders  (formal  and  nonformal)  and  other \nstakeholders  will  be  involved  in  monitoring  the  project\u2019s  progress.  The  project  strategy  is  to  maximize  employment \nbenefits from increased road construction; increased job opportunities  will also benefit the poor. Women stated they \nwould support and actively participate in the road safety component that focuses on rural people.  \n \n\nParticipation Process \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 15 \n\n57 \n\nG. \nGender Development \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \n \nThe Project will have no significant adverse impacts on women. The resettlement plans have been prepared to ensure \nwomen  are  adequately  compensated  for  any  losses  they  incur  and  are  assisted  with  relocation  and  livelihood \nrehabilitation.  The  EMDPs  contain  measures  for  a  culturally  sensitive  HIV/AIDS  awareness  program  during  the \nconstruction  phase  to  ensure  that  the  risks  of  communicable  diseases  are  minimized.  Women  are  expected  to  gain \nfrom new opportunities in both improved agricultural productivity and through the establishment of small businesses. \nGirls will be provided with more opportunities to access distant middle schools and senior middle schools. All women \nwill benefit from better access to healthcare facilities not available in villages and some of the poorer townships. Fifty \npercent of the stakeholders consulted during the social and poverty survey were women. Many women in the project \narea  are  road  users,  although  few  are  directly  involved  in  the  transport  sector.  However,  during  focus-group \ndiscussions and interviews with key female informants, it was found that women do see real benefits in improved local \nroads; their main worry is road safety issues. \n \nHas an output been prepared?                                    (cid:59)  Yes, see EMDPs        (cid:133)   No \nGender issues were assessed in the social and poverty analysis and actions are included in the EMDPs. \n \nE. \n \n \nItem \n \n \nResettlement \n\nSocial Safeguards and other Social Risks \n\n \n Strategy to Address Issues   \nOne  full  resettlement  plan  and  one  short  resettlement  plan  have \nbeen prepared in accordance with the laws and regulations of the \nPRC,  including  those  of  the  Xinjiang  Uygur  Autonomous  Region, \nand  ADB\u2019s  Involuntary  Resettlement  Policy  (1995).  Information \nbooklets  have  been  distributed  to  local  official  and  affected \npeople. \nAffordable  tolls  will  be  charged  for  the  expressway  but  no  user \nfees will be applied to the upgraded local roads which will be used \nmore frequently by local rural people in the project area. \n\nSignificant/Not \nSignificant/None \n \n(cid:59)  Significant \n(cid:133) Not Significant \n(cid:133)  None \n\n \n \nAffordability \n\n \n(cid:133)  Significant \n(cid:59) Not Significant \n(cid:133)  None \n \n(cid:133)  Significant \n(cid:59)  Not significant \n(cid:133)  None \n \n(cid:59) Significant \n(cid:133) Not significant \n(cid:133) None \n\n \n(cid:133) Significant \n(cid:59) Not Significant \n(cid:133)  None \n \n\n \n \nLabor \n\n \nIndigenous \nPeoples \n\n \n \nOther Risks \nand/or \nVulnerabilities \n \n\nEMDPs = ethnic minority development plans.  \n \n\n \n\nLabor law and contractors\u2019 provisions require equal pay for equal \nwork  and  prohibit  child  labor.

The  Xinjiang  Regional  Road  Improvement  Project  (Korla\u2013Kuqa  Section) \nwill  finance  upgrading  of  (i)  the  existing  296.5  kilometer  (km)  section  of  class  II  highway \nbetween  Korla  city  and  Kuqa  county  to  four-lane  tolled  expressway,  and  (ii)  three  local  roads \nwith  a  combined  length  of  193  km.  The  Xinjiang  Communication  Department  (XCD)  is  the \nExecuting  Agency  and  the  Xinjiang  Communications  Construction  Administration  Bureau \n(XCCAB)  is  the  Implementing  Agency.  Only  one  of  the  proposed  local  roads  will  cause  any \nresettlement impacts; the other two involve paving of a dirt track in desert areas which cause no \nimpacts  on  farmland  or  housing.  Therefore,  resettlement  plans  have  been  prepared  for  (i)  the \nexpressway  component,  and  (iii) the  local  road  in  Kuqa  county.  In  order  to  avoid  or  minimize \nland  acquisition  and  resettlement,  there  was  close  consultation  with  the  local  officials  and \naffected  people  and  village  committees  during  the  preliminary  design  and  resettlement  plan \npreparation.  \n \n2. \nResettlement  Impacts.  The  proposed  expressway  component  will  affect  3  counties, \n13 townships,  29  villages,  and  2  state  farms.  About  1,145  hectares  (ha)  of  land  will  be \npermanently acquired, of which 7 ha (0.6%) is cultivated land, 736 ha (64.3%) is wasteland, and \n344  ha  (30.0%)  is  grassland.  Land  acquisition  will  affect  50 households  (255  persons).  The \nscope  of  land  for  temporary  use  during  construction  has  not  been  finalized  yet,  but  there  is \nplenty  of  wasteland  to  utilize  so  farmland  can  be  avoided.  Residential  house  demolition \n(35,287 square  meters  [m2])  will  require  the  relocation  of  124  households  (559  persons). \nConstruction  will  also  require  the  demolition  and  relocation  of  29  household  businesses \n(1,461 m2), 6 factories (1,664 m2) and 15 service stations (12,315 m2). \n \n3. \nThe  proposed  local  road  upgrading  in  Kuqa  county  involves  the  resurfacing  of  the \nexisting  paved  road,  with  minor  adjustments  in  the  alignment.  It  will  affect  two  townships, \nnine villages, and two state farms. About 4 ha of natural grassland will be permanently acquired; \nthis is owned by collectives, so no people are directly affected. No structures will be demolished. \nCash compensation will be paid to the collectives for the lost land and trees. \n \n4. \nPolicy  and  Legal  Framework.  The  primary  objective  of  the  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement program is to ensure that the affected persons improve their standard of living, or \nat least are not made worse off because of the Project. This objective is consistent with the laws \nand  regulations  of  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  and  the  Asian  Development  Bank\u2019s \n(ADB)  Involuntary  Resettlement  Policy  (1995).  The  resettlement  plans  are  based  on  the \nprovisions of the Land Administrative Law of the PRC. In addition, the following associated laws \nand  regulations  also  apply  to  resettlement  under  the  Project:  (i)  the  State  Council  Decision  to \nDeepen Reform and Strictly Enforce Land Administration (Document 28 dated November 2004), \n(ii)  Implementation  Rules  of  Xinjiang  Uygur  Autonomous  Region  on  Land  Administrative  Law, \n(iii) Rules for Land Acquisition and House Demolition of High-Grade Highway of Xinjiang Uygur \nAutonomous  Region  (No.191)  (1996),  and  (iv)  relevant  specifications in  Document  500  (2001) \nissued  by  the  Xinjiang  Uygur  Autonomous  Region  Developing  and  Reforming  Committee  and \nFinancial Department.  \n \n5. \nthose  affected,  a  set  of \ncompensation  standards,  based  on  replacement  cost,  have  been  adopted.  The  resettlement \nprinciples  established  for  the  Project  are  that  (i)  land  acquisition  and  involuntary  resettlement \nshould be avoided or minimized where feasible by developing and comparing a series of design \nalternatives;  (ii)  compensation  and  entitlements  provided  are  based  on  market  value  or \nreplacement value, and must be adequate to allow those affected to at least maintain their pre-\n\nBased  on  consultations  with \n\nlocal  governments  and \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 17 \n\n61 \n\nincluding \n\nHousing  compensation  will  be  based  on  replacement  cost \n\nproject standard of living, with the prospect of improvement; (iii) land temporarily occupied and \nthe period for disruption are to be kept to a minimum; (iv) the per capita landholding after land \nacquisition  will  be  sufficient  to  maintain  the  previous  livelihood  standard;  (v)  where  land \nallocation per capita is not sufficient to maintain the previous livelihood standard, other income-\ngenerating activities will be provided for; (vi) a preferential policy will be provided to vulnerable \ngroups in such things as compensation, housing assignment, transfer, and employment; (vii) all \nthose affected will be adequately informed about eligibility, compensation rates and standards, \nlivelihood and income restoration plans, and project timing; and (viii) close monitoring and timely \nactions will be carried out to identify and resolve any problems. \n \n6. \nSpecifically,  the  compensation  for  permanent  cultivated  land  acquisition  is  set  at  six \ntimes the annual average output value (AAOV) in the past 3 years, and this is combined with a \nresettlement subsidy. The resettlement subsidy will be 10 times the AAOV when the per capita \nland  holding  is  above  0.133  ha  and  13  times  the  AAOV  when  the  per  capita  land  holding  is \nbelow  0.133  ha.  For  temporary  land  occupation  (if  required),  the  contractor  will  sign  the \ncontracts  with  affected  villages  or  households  and  restore  the  land  to  the  original  condition. \nLand  compensation  will  be  paid  to  the  affected  village  committee  for  public  uses,  and  the \nresettlement subsidy will be paid to affected households, who may choose to acquire rights to \navailable farmland to invest in for their own livelihood restoration. \n \ntransition \n7. \nallowances. There will be no deduction for depreciation, and people will be allowed to salvage \nmaterials  from  their  old  houses.  Relocation  will  provide  an  opportunity  to  improve  current \nhousing conditions. These rural households will be relocated to another site within their original \nvillage. All infrastructure, facilities, and other assets will be compensated for at replacement cost \nto allow full reconstruction by the concerned departments. \n \n8. \nFor enterprises, compensation will be paid to owners. The payment will be made in cash \naccording to the appraised value of the property. Compensation for standing crops, auxiliaries, \nand  other  assets  will  also  be  paid  directly  to  affected  farmers.  Income  losses  resulting  from \nreduced  production and/or  sales  and  wages caused  by  the  Project  will  be  compensated  for  in \ncash. \n \n9. \nResettlement and Rehabilitation. The resettlement strategy includes the restoration of \nliving  condition,  livelihoods,  production,  and  incomes.  Since  the  project  impacts  are  not  large, \nthe  losses  suffered  by  affected  persons  are  not  very  serious  and  can  be  compensated  for, \nmitigated, and replaced. Even in the most affected village, the land to be acquired is only 2.4% \nof the total land in the village. Therefore, all affected people will remain in agriculture, and they \nwill  be  provided  with  (i) replacement  land,  either  from  the  village  reserve  land  or  by  individual \nland readjustment; or (ii) cash compensation. The affected households have the right to choose \ncompensation  options.  In  addition,  agricultural  measures  include  such  things  as  improving \nirrigation  works,  upgrading  low-yielding  farmland,  and  provision  of  training  in  agricultural \ntechnology will also be applied. \n  \nBased on the survey results, only a few vulnerable households have been identified. To \n10. \nensure  maximum  protection  of  the  vulnerable  households,  the  following  special  provisions  will \nbe taken: (i) physical help in housing construction and free relocation, and (ii) a special subsidy \nwill  be  paid  to  enable  them  to  maintain  their  living  standards  while  constructing  their  houses. \nThe  specific  amount  for  such  assistance  will  be  determined  according  to  the  actual  condition \nand their needs. For this purpose, XCD agreed to set aside a special fund which will be used to \nprovide direct and needed help for those vulnerable people. \n\n \n\n\f62 \n\nAppendix 17 \n\nResettlement Cost and Fund Management. The total cost estimate for land acquisition \n11. \nand resettlement is CNY124.66 million ($16.4 million), including contingencies, taxes, and fees \nfor  resettlement  administration.  These  resettlement  costs  will  be  included  as  part  of  the  total \nproject  cost.  The  payment  and  use  of  compensation  funds  will  be  carried  out  under  the \nsupervision  of  the  internal  monitoring  agencies,  with  regular  review  by  the  external  monitor. \nDetailed  measurement  surveys  will  be  conducted  in  each  village  and  enterprise,  and  the \ncompensation contracts will be negotiated and signed with village committees, households, and \nenterprises. \n \n12. \nInformation  Disclosure,  Participation,  and  Grievance.  The  people  affected  have \nbeen  notified  about  the  key  elements  of  the  resettlement  plans.  On  various  occasions  during \nmeetings,  interviews,  focus-group  discussions,  public  consultation  workshops,  and  community \nconsultation  meetings,  local  representatives  have  participated  in  the  planning  and  concerns \nhave been integrated into the resettlement plans. The draft resettlement plans or Resettlement \nInformation Booklet were disseminated to affected villages and households in November 2006, \nand  resettlement  plans  were  made  available  to  the  public  through  the  ADB  website  on \n6 September 2007. \n \n13. \n When  grievances  arise,  the  affected  persons  may  submit  an  oral  or  written  complaint \nfirst to the village committee or township resettlement office. If they can not solve the issue, it \ncan  be  taken  to  the  county  resettlement  office.  If  any  affected  person  is  not  satisfied  with  the \nresponse,  or  if  the complaint  is  serious,  the  resettlement  office  will  try  to  solve  the problem.  If \nthe grievance is still not resolved satisfactorily, as a last resort, final redress may be sought in \nthe civil courts, in accordance with the Civil Procedure Act. \n \n14. \nInstitutional  Responsibilities.  The  project  resettlement  office  will  be  set  up  by  XCD \nand  the  Xinjiang  Land  and  Resources  Department  and  will  coordinate  the  planning, \nimplementation, internal monitoring and evaluation, financing, and reporting of land acquisition \nand  resettlement.  XCCAB  will  be  responsible  for  daily  supervision  on  behalf  of  XCD.  The  city \nand/or  county  resettlement  offices  will  be  set  up  for  implementing  the  resettlement  plans.  The \nresettlement  offices  will  work  closely  with  relevant  township  offices  and  village  committees, \nwhich  will  be  responsible  for  (i)  delivering  entitlements,  (ii)  selecting  new  housing  sites, \n(iii) monitoring  the  development  of  replacement  land,  (iv)  coordinating  livelihood  training,  and \n(v) implementing other economic measures. \n \n15.  Monitoring  and  Evaluation.  XCD,  with  the  support  of  relevant  local  government \nagencies,  will  take  full  responsibility  for  internal  monitoring  to  ensure  that  the  project \nimplementation  complies  with  requirements  set  out  in  the  resettlement  plans.  An  independent \nmonitor  will  be  engaged  by  XCD  to  undertake  resettlement  supervision,  monitoring,  and \nevaluation  for  the  Project.  External  monitoring  will  be  undertaken  every  6  months  during \nimplementation, and annually thereafter for 2 years. At the end of each monitoring investigation, \na report will be prepared and submitted to XCD and ADB. \n \n16. \nResettlement  Implementation.  Resettlement  implementation  will  be  scheduled  to \nprecede  the  project  component  construction  schedules.  Land  acquisition  procedures  will  be \ncarried out in the second half of 2007, and house demolition activities will occur in the first half \nof 2008. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f", "author_pages": ["CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 8 November 2007) \n \n\u2013 \n= \n= \n", "yuan (CNY) \n$0.1342 \nCNY7.451 \n", "Currency Unit\nCNY1.00\n$1.00\n", " \nThe  exchange  rate  of  the  yuan  is  determined  under  a  floating  exchange  rate  system.
